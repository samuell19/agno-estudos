Assalamu'alaikum... warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. Wa'alaikumsalaam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. Kids, before we start, I need to make an announcement. Today, a new friend is joining us. Come on, Jonni, introduce yourself. Hello, I'm Jonni. Come on, kids, say hello to your new friend. Hi, Jonni. Nussa! Isn't he the boy from yesterday? So, Jonni has won a lot of science competitions at his former school. - Science competitions? - He's smart... Since our school will be having a science competition, I hope you can participate. Okay. Looks like you got a rival. The bell is ringing! - Let's go! - Wait. - Let's go to the canteen! - Okay. Look at it, it's really cool! - Look at that! - It's so cool! That's Jonni. Jonni! You're having trouble carrying that? It looks really heavy. May I help? It's just a suitcase, piece of cake... What the... It can move? Is there a driver inside? Wow, that's cool. - Can we borrow it? - What are you guys doing? What are you guys doing? Don't get too close! Don't touch it! You'll break his stuff! - Just watch from there, okay? No touching! - That must be the remote. Synchronize... Now, launch time! Subhanallah, it's flying. Come on, launch yours too! Okay! Whoa, smooth landing! - Do it again, Jonni! Come on! - That's great! You're great! We want more! That's enough! No more! Go eat your lunch! If you all get sick, people will talk bad about this school. - He's no fun. - Show us again later, Jon! Guys, wait up! Don't go yet! - We're just about to play soccer. - Nussa will also launch his rocket. - Nussa will launch his rocket too? - Let's watch! Hey, let's watch! - How much longer? - Syifa, we're ready! Okay, everyone. Let's count together! Five, four, three, two, one! - Huh? That's it? - It doesn't even fly. - Nussa, don't give up! - Let's try again! It worked! Alhamdulillah. Syifa! Come on! Okay! Come on, let's count again. Let's count! Five... four, three, two, one! - Whoa! - It's flying. - That's all? - It falls again... - That's it? It's no fun! - Let's go. Wait, it's not done yet! - Stop! Don't go anywhere! - [Kids] Let's play soccer. Wait! Don't go anywhere! I'll be the striker! Come on! Nussa, what's wrong? - Nussa, let's try again tomorrow. - That's right, take it easy, okay? Abdul, Syifa, let's go to the usual place. - Okay. - Sure. What's happening? What's happening? Mayday, mayday! All teams, assemble! - What's wrong, Syifa? - This is bad, Captain. There's this magnetic wave pulling us in. - Okay. - Oh no! The main tunnel is damaged. Turn on the autopilot! It stopped? - Alhamdulillah. - Alhamdulillah. We made it! What is that? What is that? - What is this? - This rocket has been taken over. Be prepared... You will be my prey. Abdul! - It's over? - Yes, it is. That's all? This is more fun! - Come on! - Come on! Watch out! - Abdul! - Watch out! I'll get you! Nussa, look! Wait up! - Watch out! - Try and get me! - Wait! - Let's go! I'll get you! Don't run! Abdul, wait! Jonni... Your dinner's ready. Enjoy this, okay? Finish the meal so you can grow taller. And smarter! Okay? Aunty! Yes? Will you stay? You want to challenge me in a game? I used to be an ace in games, Panjat pinang game. Years ago... when I was much slimmer. [Mosque Announcement] Tomorrow is the first day of the holy Ramadhan. Please accept my apology. - Please accept my apology. - Hopefully everything goes well in this holy month. Aamiin, inshaAllah. - You're so cute. - Rarra... Abdul? Abdul! - Don't play with firecrackers! - Why? Our teacher said it's wasteful, remember? - Give it to me! - No, it's mine! Come on, Abdul! Nussa. But that's mine... Welcome to our school's lab. Cool and neat, right? Jonni... You're free use everything here, that's fine. But don't forget to once you're done, remember to put them back. So it won't look messy. Okay? Where's Jonni? It's only Nussa here. He's there already? What kind of magic is that kiddo using? Okay then, I'll leave you two now. Let me know once you're finished so I can lock the door again, okay? Okay! May you all be smart kids May you all be smart kids,aamiin Hello, Jonni. Here, alright. Nussa, I'm hungry... How much longer is the Iftar? It won't be long. Why don't you do your homework? Have you finished it? See? Antta! You're not fasting? Antta, it's not iftar time yet! Brother, what is this? - That's firework. - Firework? - Last year I made a rocket with it. - With fireworks? - So the rocket can light up? - That's right. - But it's for emergency only. - Oh I see... For example, if we get lost, the rocket can be used for rescue signal and pointing out direction. So if anyone sees it, they'll know where we are. Is that so? Awesome. So, what are you making now? Now I'm making something cooler than that. Great! Your rocket is getting cooler everyday. You're awesome! It's the effort and persistence that matter. You're great too, last year you only fasted for half a day. And now you're doing it until Iftar. - Keep up the good work! - Sure I will. I'll keep doing it full day. - For a whole month! - That's the spirit! Bye, Abdul. - Hurry up! - Syifa! Wait! Yeay, I won! Assalamu'alaikum. Nussa! This is called a parachute. I see, a parachute. - Wanna play? - Throw it! I got it! We need something to be generated by wind! (Parachute compartment) Like this? - Rarra! - ...who's that? Let's continue... The fangs look good... Add some claws. Go on, Abdul. She's not watching. - I'll fix the drawing. - Don't you dare. Rockets that go up into the air will quickly fall to the ground due to the gravity force. The gravity force will also push the parachute out. In order for the rocket to fall slower, we need air resistance. The air resistance from the parachute enables the rocket to land slowly. But why didn't it fly that high? I wonder too... Energy source to make it fly higher? - Just a moment. - Okay. I only have a fan dynamo, radio spare parts, - and a tricycle. - A tricycle? That'll do! Can we use a bigger bike? Nussa... I can still use my bike, right? InshaAllahyou can still use it. Astaghfirullah! My goodness... Hey, Abdul! It's done! Go ahead! Try it! Assalamu'alaikum. Hi, guys! This is my new rocket. This rocket has some developments from the previous version. InshaAllah, this rocket could do better this time. Bismillah... That's great! It has a parachute! Yes! Alhamdulillah. Nussa will win! - Nussa is great! - Thanks, all. Thanks, guys. Nussa will win. Now, let's welcome the next participant, give it up for our new friend, Jonni! Come on, Jonni! Come on, Jonni! Come on! - That's amazing! - The suitcase opened! - Whoa, bubbles! - Cool! Perfect. You're great, Jonni! - Awesome! - You're great, Jonni! That's pretty cool... Cool! How was it, Nussa? Did it fly? - Jonni! - Jonni! Who made these bubbles? Okay, kids. So that was the presentation from our friends! Give applause! They're amazing, right? So, kids. So who do you think is the winner? - Nussa! - Who do you think it is? - Nussa! - I have the winner's name right here. Come on! Keep up the spirit! I think Ilham's presentation is great too! Who? And the winner of this year is... - Nussa! As the... - Yeay! - Nussa won! - Okay, calm down... - We won! - Calm down. I haven't finished. This year we have two winners! Who's the other one? Let's congratulate... Nussa as the runner-up! And Jonni as the first winner! - Yes! - Yeay! And because their scores are only slightly different, the school decided that Nussa and Jonni will both represent the school... for this year's Ramadan Science Fair. - Nussa! - Thank you. - Nussa! - Jonni! Congratulations, Jonni and Nussa. Come on, give applause to them! Nussa! Jonni! I knew it would be Jonni! - Congrats! - Thank you. Congrats, Jonni! - You're great! - That's Jonni. - Let's congratulate him. - Okay! Thank you. - Hello, Jonni! Congrats! - Hi, Jonni! - Thank you. - You're great! Thanks. Thank you, all. - Guys, I'm off. Bye. - Bye, Jonni! Bye, see you. Hi, Jonni. Congrats for... the win. Hey, Jonni. - What you got there? - Aunty. So, Mom and Dad are coming home early, right? Yes. They've told me so. Yes! - You miss me that much? - I do. I miss you so much. She actually misses your "little something". So you can't wait to get something from me? Okay then. When I finish my work, I'll visit you. And I'll bring your favorite "little something". - You promise? - Yes. Yippee! Hurray! - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalaam. What is wrong with Nussa, Umma? He looks sad. Dewi, I'll call you back. Okay, no problem. It's alright. - Assalamu'alaikum. Bye, Rarra. - Bye. The last time I saw you this upset was... When was it? Wait... I remember! It was when you were learning to ride a bike. Do you still remember? You fell and cried. Then you got up and kept trying. You fell again. But you never gave up, did you? And now you can ride the bike without falling. - We can talk about that at the office... - That one too. Ta-da! Mom! Dad! Look! I won a rocket competition today! - Dad? - Wait. My son seems to have won something. - What is it, Jonni? - I want to show you my trophy. - It's cool, right? - Yeah, it's very cool. Great! You won again? Congrats! - In the competition... - I have a call, sorry. - Mom? - Honey? - What are you so busy about? - Wait, Honey... Next time in the science fair, I won't lose again. Okay. Nussa... Aren't you bored for always winning the first place? It's okay to be a runner-up for once. No, I don't want to be a runner-up. I want to be the real winner! Calm down, champ. No matter if you win first, second or third place... For me, you are still the champion. So, when are you coming home? I need your help. The competition is getting close. InshaAllah, I'll try my best to come home as soon as possible. - Yeay! Excellent! - Aamiin. - Dad, look. - Yes, Sweetie? Dad, I won the science competition. - See? The trophy is cool, right? - You won? That's good. - I won the first place. - Sorry, I have a call. Dad... Can you look at my trophy? I won the first place. - Okay, wait... It's my son... - Honey, can you take care of him? - Aunty... - Yes, Ma'am? Can you check if we still have space for Jonni's trophy? We still have space, Ma'am. - Mom, please look at it... - Okay. I have looked at it, Dear. Come on, Mom, Dad. Nussa, I have something for you. Really? What is that? Close your eyes first, then I'll give it to you. Close my eyes? What is it? Now you can open your eyes. What is it? Ta-da! This my present for you! Where's your present for me? So you expect something in return, huh? You won the competition, treat me some ice cream, okay? - Okay? Will you? - Come here, let me pinch your chubby cheek. That poor boy... Have you finished calling? - Hello... - Tomorrow morning... Sure, we have new collections... Hey... - This is for our champion. - Thanks, Aunty. Where's your smile? You're so handsome. I'll feed you, okay? Ouch... - It touched your nose? - Aunty, it's cold. If your nose is hungry, your stomach must be starving. [Kids] It's time for suhoor! Wake up! Suhoor! Suhoor! That sounds fun. What is that? - [Kids] Suhoor! - Nussa! Suhoor! Come on! Everyone! Wake up! Wake up! - Suhoor! - That looks fun! - I'll join them! - Rarra! - Rarra! Wait! - Suhoor! - Have you prepared the questions? - I have. There's Jonni! There's also Nussa. We can interview him too. - Come on! - Hurry up! Hello, Jonni! Hello, Nussa! Can we interview you two? - Okay, sure. - Sure thing. - Okay. - Excellent! Over there! Since you two are joining Ramadhan Science Fair, so what have you guys prepared? Last time, I used a static bike, so I wanna try other energy sources. I see... What about you, Jonni? A more advance rocket! - Can you elaborate? - That's a secret! It's definitely cooler than my previous rocket. Just wait and see. Whoa, you guys are so cool! Can you show us the rockets? Sure... Wait a minute. Whoa, that's awesome! Cool! Is that so? Yes, Abba. - Jonni is smarter than me. - Really? - His rocket is cool. The kids like it. - Really? Wow, he's great, isn't he? But... you're even greater than him. You've been the winner this whole time. And you made your rocket using recycled. - Not everyone can do that. - Really? Of course! That's why you need to be confident. Don't give up easily. So when are you coming home, Abba? Nussa... I'm so sorry. I don't think I can come home for now. What... But you're coming to the science fair, right? I can't promise you that. - I'm sorry, Nussa. - But you have promised. I know... Nussa! - Nussa! - Nussa! Sorry... It's okay, Honey. Don't worry about it too much. Don't forget to rest, okay? Okay, Honey. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalaam. What's wrong with this? You have finished? - Goodness... - What now? This is so unlike you... That's enough. There, there... Your dad works hard abroad. If you need any help, I got your back. Wait a second. I have something for you. Here it is! This could make your rocket even cooler! - You asked for this yesterday, right? - Right. - Thanks, Mr. Ucok. - Awesome! Nussa, what takes you so long to fix your rocket? Calm down, it's almost done. - Syifa, can I borrow that? - Here. While Nussa is fixing the rocket, let's see Jonni's! That's a good idea, come on! What's so great about his rocket? He's just using new parts. Well, that's the cool thing. His rocket's getting better each day. The model keeps changing. Why don't we come play with him? Who knows he might lend his cool stuff to you. - You don't want your rocket stay like this, right? - That's true. - What... - Abdul... - Nussa! - Nussa, where are you going? Gosh... - It's on you. - Did I say something wrong? You shouldn't have said anything. Umma... I want to buy new spare parts for my rocket. - I see... - May I? I think you still have more than enough stuff to use? It's wasteful to buy more stuff. Why can't I get what I want? - Huh... - Nussa... I understand... But what I mean was... [Mosque Announcement] Wassalamu'alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. wa'alaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. Abdul? Where's Nussa? He didn't come to the recitation? - Why isn't he here? - You're right... - I didn't see him inside. - Me neither. What if he's sick? - Let's go to his house. - Okay, come on. I thought Nussa went to the mosque with you guys. - No, he didn't. - We didn't see him at the mosque. Have you looked for him at the tree house? - Don't say that... - Shhhh... Tree house? Where's that? - Nussa! - Nussa! - Nussa... - Huh? - Umma... - That's him. Nussa... Please come down, Son. What happened? You're feeling unwell? It's unlike you to act like this. Why aren't you answering me? Okay, Nussa... Try to talk to me. I've told you yesterday, but you didn't listen! That's not what I mean... I don't want to come to the recitation if I can't get new spare parts! Nussa... You don't love me, Umma! - Just like Abba! - Astaghfirullah... Why did he say that? Nussa... Nussa! Nussa... wait! What do you want? Go on! Play with Jonni! Nussa. Hello, how are you? How are you? - Abdul, that's Nussa. - What? Nussa! Wanna play rocket? Nussa... Bismillahirahmanirahiim... Umma? Is Nussa joining us for suhoor? Nussa, it's Suhoor time, dear. I've eaten. If you're still hungry... I've prepared your meal on the dining table. Okay? Oh it's you, Antta... Antta... I don't want to grow up too fast. Grown-ups are busy, just like Abba. He never had time for me. If he's not coming home, I'd rather not join the science fair. Antta... Don't grow up too fast. Please stay with me. [Abba] I want to be there, Honey. But they need me here. [Umma] Don't forget that the kids also need you. You've promised and they believed you. Sorry, Honey. It's a lesson for me. I shouldn't have promised something I couldn't keep. I know, but the kids... I also wanna be there, Umma. But we detected gas leak in the main engine and I'm assigned to fix it. Please pray that I can handle it. InshaAllah... I'll pray for you. I'm sorry... I'm sorry that I can't be there for you. Trust me. Give me more time. If this problem is solved, my training is completed and I'll be home soon. [Employees] Mr. Yusuf, can you please come here for a second. Yes, one minute please. Honey, I need to get back to work. I'll talk to you later. Tell the kids I said hi. I miss them so much. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalaam. Umma... Nussa. What is it, Sweetie? I'm sorry. It's okay. [Abba] Do you remember the first person who attempted to fly? Abbas Ibn Firnas? Yes. Even Abbas Ibn Firnas went through failures. He even got into an accident and had severe injuries. But he never gave up. His theory is still relevant. It's useful for many people. Wanna try again? Do you? - I do. - Now that's my son. Ya Allah... Give Your blessings to our family. Abba, Rarra, and Nussa. Assalamu'alaikum... Keep us safe from harms. Give us guidance... to keep our devotion to You. - Aamiin. - Aamiin. Aamiin. Nussa... Umma. Umma. Nussa... Defense! - Pass the ball! - Why isn't it ringing? Time to use my special trick! Come on! Come on, Kids! Go study! Didn't you hear the bell ring? Go study! Go study as you should. This broken bell will cost me my lungs. I'll run out of breath. - What is it, Babeh? - Nussa! It's the bell. It keeps acting out! Can you fix it? So it will ring again. - Wait... - Can you try? Babeh... - Try to put this in. - That? Where? Here? Okay. Wait... Can you press the button? Woohoo! It's ringing! I can hear it even from afar. You're really something! In your hands, everything comes out useful. You're the real deal. InshaAllah, I'll pray that when you grow up... - you'll be someone who's useful to others. - Aamiin... - Thank you, Babeh. - I heard that you're joining the "semper" stuff? - It's Science Fair... - "Semper", right? I'm sure it was here... Where is it? This is bad, where is it? - Nussa... - Wait... Nussa. We haven't played with the rocket for awhile, right? Thank goodness... Alhamdulillah. - Wanna play? - Let's go! Who wants to join Captain Nussa? Me! Me! Come on, Rarra! - Are you ready? - Wait, don't rush! Hi... Hello. - Hi, Nussa. - Hello. [Rocket Speaker] This is Captain Jonni speaking! Cool... It speaks! What are these buttons for? Program activated. It's shaking! My goodness... How come? [Jonni] But, Mom... - You promised me. - Jonni... What do I do? I'll just put it here. Astaghfirullah! Oh God, it's broken. Can't you postpone it tomorrow? Please. - Nussa? - Yes, Umma? - Can you help me for a moment? - Okay, wait... Yes. - Sorry, Rarra. - Watch your step! This was hard to build. Sorry, Rarra. Now I have to redo it. - Yes, Umma? - Can you help me watch the stove? When this rings, the cooking is done. - Could you turn off the stove, please? - Okay. I forgot to buy sugar. - Thank you, Sweetie. - Okay, Umma. This one? This? No. This must be it! Not that. - Cockroaches! - The cockroaches are flying! Cockroaches! Run! I'm outta here! Hey, Nussa! You don't want to create a cockroach exterminator? Sure. I'll make it later. You have the thing I need, right? - This one? - Yes! That's the one, Mr. Ucok! Thank you, Mr. Ucok! Nussa, let's go home. So many cockroaches here. It's gross! Mr. Ucok, I'll go home first. Come on, Rarra. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalaam. Bye, Mr. Ucok. I'm afraid the cockroaches will come back. It's impossible, they won't come back. They're scared of me. If they dare to come back, I'll crush them to pieces. My goodness... Astaghfirullah... That's... What is this? Abdul, isn't that... Sorry? What do you think? Cool, right? Nussa! - Nussa! - Abdul! - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalaam. - Aunty Dewi, come in! - My dear Rarra... - I'm helping Umma. - Aunty Dewi... Nussa... Everyone, this is my younger sister, Dewi. - Hello. I'm Dini. - I'm Dewi. - I'm Nida. Do you remember me? - Yes, I think we've met before. Nussa, come here. I brought some dates, please help me hand this out for Iftar snacks. - Okay. - Thank you, Nussa. You're such a good boy helping your mom! Well, it's Nussa... He's always number one at school. - You're right. - Alhamdulillah. Wish us luck, he's joining Ramadhan Science Fair this year. I heard that our new neighbor's kid is also joining. What's his name? Right, Jonni! Nussa, isn't Jonni the kid with the remote control car? I wonder what he's making. I bet it's really good. That remote control car was good. Wait here... Where are you going? Okay, it's better now. What is wrong with your rocket? - Is it broken? - I've fixed it yesterday. Which part that was broken? There was a small crack on the case. The engine also had some troubles. But I have fixed some parts. With recycled. Like your rocket. When you weren't here yesterday, I tried to turned on your rocket. Umm... And I accidentally dropped it. I should've asked for your permission first. I'm sorry. Ah, it's okay. The rocket is even better now. Really? See? It's more solid now. So you win the science competition every year? Yeah, Alhamdulillah. I'm sorry. I took the place now. But I think your rocket is cool. - Huh? - Not bad. - It's hard to experiment with recycled. - Really? It took me awhile to make this. Abba taught me how to use recycled. Abba? Yeah, my dad. Oh... It must be nice... to get helped. My mom and dad... They're always busy. - Same here. - Huh? Abba is busy too. Ahay! Why is the lab door unlocked? Thank God, nothing's missing. [Jonni] ...can help... If not, I'm in trouble. I know someone named Mr. Ucok. He has so many types of recycled. It's good for experiments. Yesterday he even asked me to create a cockroach exterminator. - A cockroach exterminator? - Yeah! That's funny. Do you wanna go there sometimes? - It would be fun! - Okay! Should we make a cockroach exterminator? - It's almost Maghrib. Let's go home. - You're right. Let's go. What the... - Jonni! - What's wrong? We're trapped! Oh, someone's calling... Oh it's my dear Ipeh... My darling, I love you. She must know that I miss her. Hello. Argh! What do we do? My mom must be looking for me. She'll be mad and I'll be grounded... She will... Please no. Dad must be worried... Babeh, please open the door! It's no good. I have to go home. Aunty Mur will pick me up... So I need to calm down now. Calm down, Jon. We'll figure it out. I'm scared, Mom... What is this? Ta-da, this is my present! Where's your present? Okay, I'll make you a firework rocket. To lift up your spirit for fasting. A firework rocket for me, make it pink! Rarra! It's impossible for me to stay here until night... No, impossible. Impossible. Impossible! Okay. Jonni, I know what to do! Jonni, come help me! - Assalamu'alaikum. - Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalaam. - Rarra... - There's an emergency! Umma, Aunty Dewi, why isn't Nussa home? - It's almost iftar... - Astaghfirullah. - Dewi... - Calm down, I'll help look for him. Okay? Nussa... Nussa... Bismillah... Hello Assalamu'alaikum. Excuse me, Ma'am. May I know if Nussa is in your place? Yes! We have a way! The idea is, we make a rocket that launches SOS signal. At this hour, my family usually enjoys the iftar in our dining room. Our dining room window is facing here. So if we launch the rocket from the window... my family would definitely see our rocket. This is it! Okay, good! Over here, then the upper part. Alhamdulillah. There you go. Let's wash our hands. But we need to fix this part a little more. - Then... - Jonni, let's break our fast. - Okay, wait, I'll finish this first. - Come on... Let's break our fast. Okay, let's continue later. Umma said we need to break our fast with something sweet. Does it have to be dates? It's our prophet's sunnah. And dates contain a lot of glucose. - So it will bring back our energy quicker. - I see. - Wait, don't forget to pray... - Okay... Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. Nussa, can I have one more? You're hungry, huh? Thank you, Ma'am. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Where do you think Nussa is? - I don't know... - I'm worried. Me too. Antta! You just ate. We're busy, you know? Okay, then. Come with me. - Yes, right. Continue. - Okay. Here? A bit higher. - Just a bit. - Okay. - Done? - Okay... Here. Go ahead and eat, stop meowing. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim Bismillahirrahmanirrahim Yeay! Astaghfirullah! What's that? Yes! - We nailed it, Jonni! - We nailed it, Nussa! Whoa! Look at that Rarra! Whoa... That looks like... Umma! That's Nussa! Umma, come here quick! - What is it? - That's Nussa! - Where? - Look! What is that? - Abdul, why did it take so long? - It's locked. Hey, that's Babeh Jaelani. - Babeh Jaelani! - Babeh Jaelani! - I miss you so much. - Wait a second... - What is that? - Open the gate... - Over here! - Here! Okay, wait! Open the gate! It's locked. - Babeh Jaelani! - I know! Wait! I'm unlocking the door. Why are you in a rush? - I'm going in. - See? You just barge in like that. - Nussa! - Nussa! - Babeh Jaelani, have you seen Nussa? - Yes, Mam. Nussa? - Yes... - I haven't seen him. Umma! Rarra! Over here! - Wait, There he is! - Nussa! - Rarra! - Alhamdulillah. - Alhamdulillah. - Wait... How did they end up there? Nussa! Jonni! I'm so confused right now. [Umma] How is it? Good? Yes, it's good. It's so good. - The food here is all delicious. - For sure! But leave some for me. Nussa likes it so much. Aunty... Can I stay overnight here? It's fun here. - Can he, Umma? Can he? - Can he? Can he? Sure, he can. - Yeay! - Excellent! Thank you, Aunty. But I need to call Jonni's Mom first. So his parents won't get worried. Right. Yes! Jonni, can I play with your suitcase? - Can I? - Yes, you can. Great! Yeay! Antta, come and get me! Nussa, I once saw in TV, a rocket with amazing components. We have to make something like that! Sure! InshaAllah. Nussa! Rarra! Can you stop playing for now? Jonni is getting picked up soon. So we have to stop playing? Bye, suitcase. - Okay then, Nussa. I'm off. - Okay. Aunty Mur is here. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam - Jonni! - Jonni! - Jonni! - Mom! Dad! - Dad! - Hey there, Buddy... My goodness... - Ma'am... - Ma'am... - Thank you for taking care of Jonni. - You're very welcome. - We're sorry if it's troublesome for you. - No, not at all. The kids are happy that their friend is here. - Is this Nussa's little sister? - Hello, I'm Rarra. Jonni is welcomed to stay overnight anytime. I see... We're off, Ma'am. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalaam. Tomorrow we'll go to Mr. Ucok's place, right? - Yes, we will! - Okay. - Bye, Nussa!
