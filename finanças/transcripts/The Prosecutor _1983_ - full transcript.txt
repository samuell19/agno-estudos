[suspenseful music] - [Narrator] In making a decision about the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we have the benefit of being able to look back over nearly 2,000 years of recorded history. But what if we didn't have that advantage? What if the resurrection occurred only two years ago? [suspenseful music] - That's exactly right, Stan. Even though it has been two years since rumors began circulating that Jesus Christ had risen from the dead, the story of his resurrection is still making news today. In fact, authorities claim it was exactly that, the teaching of his resurrection, that caused today's disturbance in the civic center. An altercation broke out between members of the metaphysical society and unknown persons in the crowd. The society was demonstrating against the resurrection, claiming the teaching of it was unfairly harming their businesses. Authorities have not said whether any of the followers of Jesus were directly involved in the disturbance, however they do claim that it was tension caused by the teaching of the resurrection that created a climate in which, quote, "Trouble was bound to happen." Reporting live from the civic center, I'm Tom O'Brien. Now back to our studios. - I thought we settled this Jesus situation. We get him outta the way and now things are worse than they ever were. And all because of this resurrection talk. Now we must come up with a better way to stop this talk of his resurrection than we did to stop Jesus himself. I want to put a stop to this hoax permanently. - Well obviously killing all of his followers isn't going to do the job. In fact, I think that would just make matters worse. We learned that from Jesus. I think we oughta go by the book on this one. That way no one can question what we've done. There must be some legal way that we can stop all of this coming back from the dead nonsense. - Any suggestions, Paul? - Yes. There just might be a way. [ominous music] If we can go to court and if we can prove that there really was no resurrection, then we can claim that-- - If we can prove there was no resurrection. You don't believe that fairytale do you? - No, of course not. What I mean is that if we can get the court to rule that Jesus did not rise from the dead then we have the law on our side. So, if the followers of Jesus continue to teach something that the court has ruled to be a lie, then they are obviously involved in some type of conspiracy to stir up trouble. A perfect grounds for legal arrests. Besides, once the court has ruled that it's a fraud, who's gonna believe them anyway? Good. That's good, Rod. Carl wants no screw ups. Nothing must go wrong. This resurrection talk is causing too much trouble, and it's getting worse. You can just feel the tension and the unrest everywhere you go. A few years ago my wife ran into one of his followers in the beauty parlor. Strange group of people, these followers of Jesus. But where a few years ago they were only strange, today they're downright dangerous. I mean that, Rod. They are dangerous. And that's why I'm takin' the case myself. Who better than the attorney general to prove once and for all that the alleged resurrection of Jesus Christ never really happened? Who do you think he was anyway? Claiming to be the son of God? Oh, and his followers say that his resurrection proves it. Well I'm gonna expose him for what he really was. I am gonna put the resurrection on trial. [suspenseful music] - How are ya, Paul? - Well who woulda thought? My best student. Michael, I hope I haven't trained you too well. - All rise. Court is now in session, the Honorable William Stewart presiding. - Be seated. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we are gathered here today to decide only one issue. We are here to decide if the resurrection of Jesus Christ actually took place. Our law does not permit anyone to publicly teach anything that has not been proven to be true. The followers of Jesus would be in violation of the law by teaching that he rose from the dead if he did not rise from the dead. You are to base your decision not on what you may think of the government, nor of the followers of Jesus, nor on what if any opinion you may have of Jesus himself, or his teachings for that matter. You are to base your decision based upon the evidence presented in this courtroom and on nothing else. Are the People ready? - Yes they are, Your Honor. - [William] And the Defense? - The Defense is ready, Your Honor. - Very well then, Mr. Hogan. You may proceed. - Thank you, Your Honor. Now, I don't wanna waste any of your valuable time relating all the events that have led up to this preposterous hoax that the followers of Jesus are tryin' to pull off here, but I would like to briefly highlight some of the events that occurred over the past couple of years that I believe will play a significant part in these proceedings. And how did they do it? They did it by sneaking. [soft suspenseful music] So he and his followers were obviously intent on stirring up trouble. And once he was executed, they had lost their figurehead. Without him, where would they be? What would become of them? So they had to bring him back to life, resurrect him so to speak. And all of this so they could continue to undermine the government and all of the sacred traditions that we have cherished in this society for hundreds of years. And how did they accomplish it? How did they resurrect his memory? For that's all that's ever been resurrected. They did it by stealing his body. Stealing his body and then claiming that a dead man had come back to life, something that we all know is scientifically impossible. Our laws will not permit them to lie in this way. And that is why you the jury must not allow it either. - This is a court of law, a court where decisions are made based upon the evidence presented. The Defense will prove the People have no evidence for their claim that the resurrection never happened. The attorney general over there has just spent a great deal of your time telling you that the followers of Jesus are out to undermine the government. Well I could spend a great deal more of your time telling you that nothing could be further from the truth. But that is not what is at issue here. Did Jesus rise from the dead, as he predicted he would, or didn't he? That is the central issue, and that is what you are to decide, and you are to make your decision based upon evidence. It's your sworn duty. The tomb is empty. There is no body. Jesus Christ is not in the grave, and the disciples did not steal the body. In fact, some of them did not believe he had risen from the dead until they could see him and touch him for themselves. See him? Oh yes, they saw him, and talked with him, and ate with him. And they weren't the only ones. [soft bright music] A scientific impossibility that a man could come back from the dead? Without God, yes. With God, no. And by the end of this trial it will become obvious as to exactly who Jesus Christ really is. [suspenseful music] [court observers chattering] [gavel thudding] - [William] I want quiet in this courtroom. [court observers chattering] I want quiet, do ya hear? - Would you raise your right hand, please? State your name. - Darren Scott Charles, PhD. - Dr. Charles, do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God? - I do. - You may be seated. - So then, Dr. Charles, what you're saying is that it is against the law of nature for a man to come back from the dead, that scientifically it can not happen. - That's correct. Once a cell dies, and especially a brain cell, it will not regenerate. It can not come back to life. A physical resurrection, as you say, is scientifically impossible. - Well thank you, Dr. Charles. No further questions. Your witness, Mr. Lindsey. - Dr. Charles, if a physical resurrection is an event that is contrary to the law of nature, then it must be an event that is beyond nature, correct? - But that is impossible. There is nothing beyond nature. - Oh, but if there is, hypothetically speaking, something beyond nature, wouldn't you agree that a resurrection could happen? A supernatural event of course, but still quite possible? - Objection, Your Honor. The Defense is asking the witness a hypothetical question which has nothing to do with Dr. Charles's expertise as a scientist. - Oh, to the contrary, Your Honor. One part of science is the forming of hypotheses based upon observation. I'm simply asking Dr. Charles to comment on a hypothesis that has been advanced to explain the observation that Jesus' tomb is empty. - Objection is overruled. Dr. Charles, you may answer the question. - It is ridiculous to believe that a resurrection could happen because hypothesis or no hypothesis, there is nothing beyond nature. - But if there is-- - There is nothing beyond nature. - Let me ask the question one last time and, Your Honor, would you please direct the witness to answer the question? Dr. Charles, if there is, hypothetically speaking, something or someone beyond nature, isn't it possible for a resurrection to occur? [suspenseful music] - Dr. Charles? - I don't see the point. - I'm surprised, Dr. Charles, I'm really surprised. I'm no Albert Einstein, but I do recall that a scientist, a scientist by the name of Heisenberg, has proven that nature is open, that it is not closed, and that at any given moment the basic stuff of the universe can be altered like that [snaps] given the proper conditions. It's come to be known as the Heisenberg principle of uncertainty, has it not? - Yes it has. - And if Heisenberg's principle is scientifically valid, then supernatural occurrences, occurrences beyond nature, are possible, aren't they? - Objection, Your Honor. Mr. Lindsey is leading the witness. - Your Honor, I am simply reasoning from scientific premise to scientific conclusion with a scientist. - Objection is overruled. The witness will answer the question. [suspenseful music] - All right. Hypothetically speaking, yes it's possible, but only-- - Thank you, Dr. Charles. No further questions, Your Honor. - Impressive. Good record. Colonel Jacobs, you were the leader of a squad of soldiers ordered to guard the tomb of Jesus, is that not correct? - Yes, sir. - Mm-hm. Why were you ordered to guard the tomb of a dead man? Isn't that a little unusual? Unless of course trouble was expected. - Trouble was expected, sir. At least my orders indicated such. My orders were to guard the tomb to prevent anyone from stealing the body. My superiors were worried that the disciples of Jesus would steal the body and then claim that he had risen. - Uh-huh, oh I see. Claim that he had risen. But you didn't a do a very good job of that, did you, Colonel Jacobs? - [clears throat] No, sir, we didn't. - Could you tell the court what happened? - Well, it was late Saturday night, actually I guess it was early Sunday morning, my men and I had not had very much rest the previous few days what with the festival and all, so we were very tired and we fell asleep. It was that simple. And while we were asleep, the disciples came and stole the body. - Wait a minute, what you're telling me is that, as a military man with your years of experience, that you fell asleep? And while you were sleeping, the disciples of Jesus stole the body. - Well, yes, sir. - Well, thank you, Colonel Jacobs. Thank you. Thank you for admitting something that must be very difficult for you to admit. - You don't know how difficult. - Colonel Jacobs, you testified that you were ordered to guard the tomb of Jesus to prevent the body from being stolen. I assume then that you did take some precautions, you did institute some safeguards? - Yes, sir, as a matter of fact we did. [soft suspenseful music] Okay, careful with the stone, men. To prevent anyone from getting into the tomb, we put a large stone slab over the entrance. Let's make sure it fits really good. Oh no ya don't, we're not finished yet. This tomb still has to have a seal alarm. - I can just imagine that moving that slab into place must have taken a lot of effort. It isn't easy moving a stone that large. There must have been some commotion and noise. So, Colonel Jacobs, do you mean to tell this court that while two men were guarding the entrance to the tomb and the rest of them were just a short distance away, that a group of men snuck into the camp, moved the stone, and carried off a body without disturbing anyone? - Well, like I said earlier, sir, we were tired, we were asleep. It's been a long week. - A long week. Colonel Jacobs, what's the penalty for a solider abandoning his post? - A soldier we've found guilty of abandoning his post is usually executed before a military firing squad. - And what's the penalty for falling asleep while on duty? - Objection, Your Honor. Mr. Lindsey is deliberately trying to discredit this witness, and this question is totally irrelevant to these proceedings. - Mr. Lindsey? - The relevancy will become obvious shortly, Your Honor. - You may proceed. - Colonel Jacobs, what is the penalty for falling asleep while on duty? - What do you mean? - The penalty for falling asleep while on duty. It's the same as abandoning your post. The penalty is death, isn't it? - Well. [ominous music] - Colonel Jacobs, can you explain to this court why an exception has been made in your case? According to the law, you and your men should be dead. Can you tell this court why you can testify here today that the disciples stole the body while you were asleep when, if that was true, you should have been executed for it? And while you're explaining that, why don't you tell us how, if you were asleep, how you knew the disciples stole the body. Please, Colonel Jacobs, we're waiting for your explanations. [suspenseful music] - Well, they told me. - They told you. Colonel Jacobs, why don't you tell this court what really happened that night. - Smith, Jackson, relieve these two men. [earth rumbling] [soldiers chattering] Fall in! - [Soldier] Let's get outta here. - I tried to get the men to regroup, but... As a military man I obey the orders of my superiors without question. That's why I testified that the disciples came and stole the body. [ominous music] Frankly, I don't know what happened to the body of Jesus. All I know is that I have never seen anything like that in my entire life. - Oh, no more coffee, thanks. - [Waitress] Okay. - Now, everything's gonna be all right, Sheila. We still should be able to get to your testimony today. - But Mr. Lindsey, I don't know what to say. I don't know what he's going to ask me. - There's not need to worry. All ya have to do is tell the court exactly what ya saw. There's nothing more to it than that. - Okay. Michael, do you mind if I call you Michael? - No. - There's something I've always wanted to know. Why did you get involved? Why risk your reputation, your career defending the resurrection? Did you know Jesus personally? - Well actually no, but it seems like I did. The resurrection became very important to me a little less than two years ago. I'd just passed the bar exam and I was starting to work for a large legal firm downtown. I was married at the time and we had a little boy-- - Honey, would you mind watching Michael tonight? There's a meeting I'd like to go to. - I didn't know you had a meeting tonight. - Well, I didn't. This just came up. - This doesn't have anything to do with Jesus, does it? I thought you stopped going to those meetings after he was killed. - Will you just not start on this? [chuckles] - Here I am, a self-respecting young attorney trying to establish my practice. Does my wife help? Does she care? No. All because she's fascinated with some lawbreaker who claimed to be the son of God. You know how this makes me look, huh? I thought we'd put this all behind us, and now you wanna go running off to those meetings again. Why? I really wanna know why. - One of Jesus' closest friends, you remember Peter? He's gonna be speaking tonight. He saw Jesus alive. - Oh no. - Michael, just come with me and then you can see for yourself what they have to say. - No way. - We can drop Michael off at my mom and dad's and then we can just go. [laughs] Look at you. - Oh, I'll clean it up. - Oh honey. - I'll clean it up. Oh boy, here I'll take care of it. You go off to your meeting if it makes you happy. I wouldn't be caught dead at one of those things anyway. - Oh honey, are you sure? - Yeah, I'll take care of it. Go on, go. [soft twinkling music] Yeah. I wonder where Mommy is. She shoulda been home by now, huh? You're just gonna have to wait for your goodnight kiss. Yeah. Okay. [phone rings] Yeah? Yeah, this is Michael Lindsey. [suspenseful music] When? Well what happened? Oh no. Yeah, yeah I'll be right there. [siren blaring] Doctor? - [sighs] I'm sorry, Mr. Lindsey. We did everything we could, but the injuries were just too severe. I'm sorry. - I wanna see her. - Michael, I don't think that'd be a good idea right now. - She's my wife, I wanna see her, Doctor. - Okay, give us a few minutes. [ominous music] - Excuse me. [Michael grunts] I'm sorry about your wife. - What? My wife? You know Cheryl? Who are you? - My name's Peter. I knew Cheryl from the meetings we-- - Peter? Peter? Jesus freak Peter? - Michael, Cheryl-- - My wife's dead because of you, man. You and your stupid useless Jesus meeting, ya know that? - I'm sorry, Michael. - You're sorry? My wife is dead! - I know. - She's dead. [soft suspenseful music] - Michael, Jesus said that if anyone would believe in him, even though they were dead they would live. Cheryl believed in him. She's with him now. - Yeah, she's with him now. They're both dead. - No, they're alive. Cheryl is alive because he's alive. I know it. I've seen him. - Michael, I had no idea. It must have been awful for you. - It was tough, but the toughest part were those words of Peter that Cheryl was alive with Jesus. I just couldn't get those out of my mind. It became an obsession to me, so I decided to check the whole thing out for myself, and I checked everything. I went to the tomb, I questioned the soldiers who were guarding the tomb that night, and I read everything that I could about Jesus, what he did, what he said. I interviewed all kinds of people that had seen him alive. Peter's right, Sheila. Cheryl is alive with Jesus and I know it. I checked it out and I'm convinced now. And that's why I'm here today. We'd better get back or we're gonna be late, okay? - Will you slow down already? What are ya tryin' to do, kill me? - What's the big deal? We've hiked this trail a million times no problem. Come on. - So my girlfriend, Christy, she asked me to go on this leisurely hike. [chuckles] Hey, let's stop a minute so you can catch your breath. - Me catch my breath? Oh right. [chuckles] Sheila, what's wrong with you this morning anyway? - Oh well, to tell you the truth, after last night, this morning came awfully early if you know what I mean. - You and Don must've been out pretty late, huh? - Well, late enough. After we got home, [chuckles] well let's just say I didn't get much sleep. - [clicks tongue] I don't wanna hear about it. You know how I feel about you and Don living together. Besides, Jesus said he'd meet us at the top of that hill today and I just don't wanna be late. Come on, Sheila, let's go. - Look, Christy, Jesus is dead. [ominous music] I know you followed him while he was alive. What good is that now? We have climbed all this way for what? Nothing. I only came along to humor you, maybe work off some of last night. Let's hurry up, let's go. We don't want Jesus to disappear before we get there, now do we? [upbeat music] Oh. [dramatic music] - Sheila, look, there he is! I knew he'd be here. Oh, I knew he'd come! - How did he? It... Oh, oh, Christy, wait for me. [group chattering] [soft orchestral music] It's not that I hadn't heard of Jesus, but there were just too many things happening in my life for me to pay any attention. I figured I had a lot of time before I'd have to think about God. I'd get into that when I was older, when things slowed down. There he was, standing there looking right at me as if he'd known me my entire life. There were so many people around that I couldn't count them and yet all the time he seemed to be looking directly at me. This may sound strange, but I could tell that he cared for me. Oh, he didn't have to say anything. I could just tell by the way he looked at me. Oh Mr. Lindsey, they killed him, but I saw him. He was very much alive. - Miss Jones, you're employed at Beverly's Beauty Salon, is that not correct? - I was. - You were? Something happen? - Well I... So as we were coming up over the top of the hill, down below, there he was. - You can't be serious. You don't expect me to believe a wild story like that. Now Sheila, really, I'm surprised at you. - But Mrs. Hogan, you've gotta believe me. I don't know what it all means. I just know that I saw him. He was there. We all saw him. I know it sounds crazy. They said he was dead, but it was him. I know it was him. He was standing there directly in front of me just looking at me. - Sheila! Sheila, come back. I didn't meant it. - Leave me alone, just leave me alone. - Miss Jones, do you call that very rational behavior? - No, I guess not. - And this event occurred when? Oh yes, two days after you saw Jesus on the hilltop. Is that correct? - Uh-huh. - Miss Jones, do you expect this court to believe that you were rational on the day that you said you saw Jesus when just two days later you storm out of a beauty parlor for no reason at all? How can you explain that? Why should we believe anything that you have to say? - Objection, Your Honor. The prosecutor is badgering the witness over an inconsequential event. - Sustained. Mr. Hogan, I must warn you. - No, that's all right. I'll answer the question. Mr. Hogan, all my life I've wanted to be accepted. So maybe I did some things that I shouldn't have done so I'd be like everybody else. I just wanted people to like me. And all that changed when I saw Jesus. My boyfriend Don? He moved out. Even some of my friends started to make fun of me. When that customer in the shop started up with me, well I just had to get out. I didn't know how else to handle it. [soft piano music] But I realize now that it's not so important what other people think of me. Jesus has accepted me and that's all that really matters. [suspenseful music] - I wasn't there the first time Jesus appeared. - You're amazing. What do I have to say to convince you? - Do you really expect me to believe you? - Yes, I do. - How could he be alive? You saw him crucified. - Thomas, I know it's hard to believe. I mean, I didn't believe it myself when I first heard about it, but Thomas, the Lord is alive. I've seen him, we all have seen him. - Oh? - We were meeting here to discuss what the women had seen. Suddenly he was there, right in front of us. He even showed us the wounds in his hands and in his side. - You saw the wounds, did you? - Yeah. - Well I'll tell ya what. I'll believe when I not only see the wounds, but touch them as well. - Thomas, why don't you believe me? - Because I didn't see him. - We saw him! We saw him. Don't you think I'm telling you the truth? [somber music] - Well, I, I don't know what you may have seen. When I see them and touch them, then and only then will I believe. It was a little over a week later, eight days to be exact. You don't forget a thing like that. Well, a little more than a week had gone by and I still had not seen one sign of Jesus. I was even more convinced they were off their rockers. We were meeting in the same room. We always met in that room. [soft bright music] We were there and he appeared. One minute he's not there, the next minute he is. Everyone else was excited, but I just stood there. And who did Jesus come right over to? Me. He even, he even offered to let me touch his hands and his side, but I just couldn't. I couldn't believe I had been so stubborn. The whole group had seen him, but I just couldn't believe it until I saw him. When I did, I just fell down at his, I just fell down at his feet. I was so ashamed. - Thomas, did you see him any other times? - Oh yes, a number of other times. - Your witness, Mr. Hogan. - Thomas. Or should I call you Disciple Thomas? I mean, that is what you are all called, disciples, isn't it? Thomas you said, "The whole group had seen him." - Yes, sir. - Well you must have felt pretty left out. I mean, what with everyone else having seen Jesus and you not seeing him. In fact, everyone must have really been on you, pressuring you to believe, believe! It must have been very hard. - No, not nearly as hard as my heart was not to believe my own friends. - Oh come on, Thomas. You're not like the rest of them. You're different. You're an educated man. You've been to college. You studied psychology, you know something about pressures. And facing this pressure, this inner conflict going on within you, is it just possible that subconsciously you wanted so badly to be a part of the group, so badly to belong, to be accepted, that when everyone else began to see him that you would begin to see him, too? Now, isn't that possible? - It's possible. And it's an interesting theory, but it's not true. Now, despite what I was told, I fully never expected to see Jesus. God forgive my doubt, but he appeared to me when I was fully convinced he never would because I believed he had not appeared to anyone at all. Now, I didn't want to believe, but once I saw him, what else could I do? - What else could you do? Exactly. - So Peter, you were one of his closest followers. - Yeah, that's right. - And you were there when they led him into court for his trial? [ominous music] - Yeah, I was there. [reporters shouting] - [Reporter] Please, please! - You're one of his followers. [reporters chattering] - I'm not one of his followers. Wait, no! [everyone chattering at once] - [Reporter] What do you know of him? - [Reporter] What did he say? - I don't know him! I've never seen the man before in my life! Leave me alone! Leave me alone. [reporters shouting all at once] Ya see, I thought it was over. I mean, all our plans and the dreams and all our hopes. They killed him. I thought it was over. - What changed your mind? - I saw him again. He came back just like he promised he would. I mean, at first I didn't believe it. I saw the empty tomb and I heard what Mary said, but I watched him die. I mean, they hung him on a cross and they stuck that spear into his side, but I saw him. I saw him, he was standin' right there in front of me. I knew then without a doubt that he was the son of God. He arose. He came back from the dead. That's what's made the difference in my life. - You were very disappointed when Jesus died, weren't you? - Yes, I was. - I don't believe the jury could hear you. - Yes, I was. - And weren't you even more disappointed when you denied knowing him? - Yes. - You had failed him, and you wanted to do anything that you could to make it up to him, didn't you? Well didn't you? But that's where you were wrong because he failed you. He got caught! And he was executed. And that's why you made up this whole big, fishy story about the resurrection so you could make yourself a big man. - Look, I failed him, that's right, but he never failed me. He died, you were able to kill him because he let you, but you weren't able to keep him in the grave. This is no story that I made up. This is true. Jesus rose from the dead. - [Paul] Or you just imagined that Jesus rose from the dead. - Jesus rose from the dead, I saw him. I ate with him and I touched him and I'm not the only one. This isn't my imagination. It was Jesus. - How convenient. Jesus is back and he reveals himself to you so you can become the big leader just the way that you always wanted to. Isn't that the way it is? - You callin' me a liar? - [Paul] By his own mouth, Your Honor. - Hey wait a minute, don't walk away from me! - Quiet. - Don't walk away from me. - Quiet. - I know what I saw. - Out of order. - Look, I don't know what he's tryin' to make you guys believe. - Quiet. - I saw Jesus. - [William] I'll hold you in contempt of court. - So you see, what we have here is really quite simple. What we have here is a group of people who are so disappointed that their leader died that they have to bring him back to life again. And so they make up this story about his rising from the dead, and you know how stories go. One thing leads to another and before you know it, they really begin to believe their own story, that Jesus did rise from the dead. And once they believe that what they've said is true, then they really begin to see him. And those who wanna remain to be part of the group, well, they have to see him, too. And that is why they have been going all throughout the country spreading the news that Jesus Christ has risen from the dead! And do I need to remind you that they have stirred up a great deal of trouble? But that is why we have laws prohibiting this type of thing, and that is why you must put a stop to it. And you can do it by ruling that the resurrection is what it really is, a fraud. Ya see, this whole Jesus movement really stands or falls on the resurrection. You put an end to the resurrection, and you put an end to these troublemakers. And who do they think that they're trying to fool anyway claiming that a man can come back from the dead? Now you have heard the testimony of expert witnesses claiming that it is scientifically impossible, that it is totally against the law of nature for a man to rise again, but what do they say? God made it happen. That's their answer for everything. God. Oh, if it's impossible, say God did it. As rational women and men, you can not believe in anything that you can not see, feel, or experience. Reject the resurrection. It's the only rational thing to do. - But you have seen witness after witness testify that they have seen the resurrected Christ, and not just once, but many times. And these are not men and women who wanted him alive so badly that they began imagining he was alive. When he was executed, what did they do? They hid. They were scared, they wanted to save their own skins. So why then should they expose themselves preaching that he had risen from the dead? Exposing themselves to the same authorities that killed Jesus. Because they made it up? No. These people are willing to risk their own lives because he is alive. [soft bright music] And I've only called a few witnesses, but if you wanna hear from a few more. - Mr. Lindsey, where are you going? Mr. Lindsey, come back here. Mr. Lindsey, where are you going? [group chattering] - He is alive. [group chattering] He is alive, the Messiah is alive. [group chattering] - I saw him. I saw him, I saw him. [gavel thudding] [court observers chattering] - One more action like that and I'll hold you in contempt of court. - I'm sorry, Your Honor, but I just wanna make a point, and the point is this. Why are there hundreds of people in this building ready right now to testify that Jesus Christ has come back from the grave? Because he has. The testimony is overwhelming that the tomb is empty, the body's not in the grave. Jesus has risen from the dead. How? How could this scientifically impossible event actually occur? Because Jesus was no ordinary man. He is the son of God. God himself in human flesh. [triumphant music] Hard to believe? No, not if you believe in the God who created this world. If he could create the mountains and the oceans, if he could design a world that fits together perfectly, he could certainly come back from the dead. And he has, the testimony is sure. The attorney general is right about one thing. The Jesus movement does stand or fall with the resurrection. There is no fence sitting. If you believe Jesus rose from the dead, it should change your life, just like it changed the lives of Peter and Thomas and many, many others. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the resurrection is a fact.
