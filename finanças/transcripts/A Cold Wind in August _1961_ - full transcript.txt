[DOOR CLOSING] I'm going to the basement, okay? Sure. [CLICKS TONGUE] [KNOCKS AT DOOR] [CHUCKLES] Back from the what? The dead? You kill me. Look at you. Not bad for an old broad, huh? Come in, man. Out in the wet. Hey, I like this. This I like. Beats hell out of the Pere Marquette Hotel, doesn't it? [LAUGHS] The Pere Marquette. Do you remember that little Australian girl with the hysterics? And you thought you was gonna make her. Huh? [CHUCKLES] I never thought that at all. So tell me, what's with you? I only said that... Wait a minute, do you want a drink? Are you still drinkin' your lunch?Well I... Come on, man. You look like you need one. Okay, whatever you're having. Me at this hour? Oh, no, thank you. Rocks, okay? Mmm-hmm. Really gorgeous place you got here. [SIGHS] My God it's hot though, maybe it's me. No, it's that bloody air conditioner. One of those, I'll get it for your whole sale, you know what I mean? Why buy it retail when I got a friend, all you have to do is go over and pick it up? You go over and you pick it up and it craps out on you. Who's that, Juley? The air conditioner? Yeah. Who else always gives me what don't need? So, what gives? Well, honey. I am in bindsville. I am really jammed. So what else is new? Oh, come on, Iris. I'm serious. Here's the bit. I made a deal with this burlesque house in Newark, you know. I'm to furnish for three months all the material. The comics, the chorus, four girls and every week a new star. The four girls, you know, you can get anywhere. Dogs, you know what I mean? And this really big girl, I... Now, somebody like yourself. Well, not with your class, but you know, how many are there? But... Somebody with a big name. Okay?Go on keep talking. I'm gonna try that lousy air conditioner again. Yeah. So... Yeah. Well as I was saying... What it all boils down to is, Novella Dawn, remember her? You know, nothin' up here but with the crazy stomach muscles. And that corny bit about biting the balloon with the teeth. That's corny I know, but you know, it's got something, right? Yeah, yeah. Why did I ever let them give me this cruddy machine? Such a big deal. I could have bought one. Go on. And look, don't knock it.Yeah. She's got a good act. I'm not knocking. She's no Beryl Cobalt, but I'm not knocking. She's knocking. She's knocked up. Go on. She's knocked up? How? I want to know how? With what? Do I know? Was I there? All of a sudden I get a telegram. She's pregnant. "Sorry, Novella." Is that a guess? [CHUCKLES] So what you're saying, you're on the hook. Up to here. Look, Iris, you know what butchers these guys are. Either I make good or they break the contract. And that's not good enough, they grind it in a little. They'll mark me lousy in Vegas, Miami, you know the bit. Weingartner with the nose drops, don't cross me up. Remember? Come off it. Iris, please, I mean it. This is it. I'm stuck. You know what I can't figure out? I mean, I'm not tryin' to bug you, I really mean it. I just... I can't figure out how I could have ever married you. [SIGHS] My God, Iris. What are you trying to do to me? God, it's hot in here. Mind if I open the window? Go ahead. I told you, you wouldn't understand. IRIS: I mean, I'm not trying to put you down, or anything, it's just... I don't get it. Of course, before you put on all that lard. You lose that boyish charm, man, and you're dead. HARRY: How do you like that? A hot day like today, and those kids got to make a fire. One of 'em's waving a flaming broomstick. Nuts. All right, I'm sorry. I won't needle you anymore. Look, Iris, all I'm asking, just fill in for one week, huh? Just one week. Look, I know it's been two years since you played burlesque. And after those big clubs in Vegas and Miami, little thing like this, it's a drag, I know. But just one week, please. Honest, just one week. Needless to say, I wouldn't take a dime. But you know, I don't like to work in the summer. What's work? One week, that's work? What's more, I don't like to work in Newark. I never have. I live here. I like it. I like this house. I like eating at home. I like living like a human being! Why should I knock myself out? This is my retreat. You know? You don't have to say anything about it now. Isn't gonna take place for like about a month. Okay? Look, I'll think it over, okay? Good enough? Isn't it enough we're divorced already? Divorced, that isn't a gas. I can't even remember what color toothbrush you used. All right, don't rub it in. A mad caprice, gay adventure, huh? That bit. Okay, I'll give you a call. Okay, okay. I want to call the super about that air conditioner before my eyeballs start frying. [SIGHS] As soon as you leave I'm going to get out of these frankfurter pants so I can breathe. Well, go ahead. You know me. I know you, all right. Lots of plans and no action. Always, that's what the trouble was, remember? Look, thanks for the drink. Hello, Mr. Perugino. Uh, I'll call you. This is Miss Hartford from 4B. All right? I'm terribly sorry to trouble you, but there seems to be something wrong with my air conditioner. It doesn't work and I wondered whether you could come up and take a look at it? So, all of a sudden you're chicken? It's not like we're going to beach for a date, it's just... Three girls, two fellows, that's all. We're not gonna eat you up. Look, who says I wanna go to the beach? I mean, did you ever think of that? What's such big deal, the beach? Besides I got a stick ball game on. Me and Dom are gonna play. Dom said he's going, so you can forget about that part of it. So what other excuses you got? Where is it written in the book that says, "I got to go to the beach?" Suppose I tell you Carol Kenny's coming along? Who? Carol Kenny. Oh, what a dope! Sometimes I could... You met her at the Holy Name Society dance, remember, last month? She just moved into the neighborhood from the West Side. Oh, what a brain! What a brain! So who remembers last month? Vito, come inside a minute, eh? Yeah, okay, Pa. Okay, lover. Ah. Yeah, Pa. What's up? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Ow! The girls are beginning to bother you, huh? Wait, it's going to be worse. Ah, you know broads. So, what's up? You got to go up to 4B. The lady called up. Her air conditioner doesn't work. I think it's the switch. Anyway, I told her you'll come up and take a look at it. Oh, do I have to do it now, Pa? We got a game on, the guys are waitin'. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] I'm telling you to go up to see that beautiful woman. A Madonna with hair like gold. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] All right, okay, I go myself. Aw, okay, I'll go. [CHUCKLES] I thought I was doing you a favor. After all, I'm an old man now. Young, handsome boy like you, who knows? [GROANS] Go hurry. If you're a good boy, maybe she'll rub it for you. I know about that Boccacio, Pa, you reading all those dirty books. [HUMMING] Me, Zorro stopped you. Ah, me, Zorro. You, Zorro? You just a... So you're on vacation, huh? That's why I never see you. When it was school I used to bunk into you all the time. [CHUCKLES] And now you're busy. Got a lot of girlfriends, huh? Ah, I can take 'em or leave em, you know. A regular Gregory Peck. Oh, by the way uh, I got some clothes from my husband. It's some summer things I was gonna send away to Korea. If you can use 'em, come up. Okay?Okay. Some of the things are brand new. Thank you. Don't forget. All right, thanks. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Yes? Hi. I'm Vito. My father said that I should come up to fix a switch. Well, I thought that... Oh, you're Mr. Perugino's boy. Yeah, Vito. Well, Vito. Good, Vito. Come on in. I'm Iris. I was just finishing dressing. Well, there it is, that's the rascal. Go, man. Is there anything you need? Ah, yeah, you got some newspapers? Uh, I'm kind of a slob you know. Newspapers, yes. Oh, look sweetie, you get 'em, will you? They're in the kitchen on top of the ice box. I'm gonna change my blouse. IRIS: How you doing? VITO: Okay. You think you can handle it or do I have to call one of those repair guys? Well, uh... Well, it's just a switch, you know? Uh, well, I mean it's up to you. Oh, no, honey if you can do it, that's wonderful. I just thought it might be a big part or something. No, it's easy. Just take me five minutes. See, there's nothing wrong with the fan. Go on, keep talking, I just wanna get something. Could you open this for me? Yeah, sure. There, it's easy. Hey, how about that. You Tarzan, me Jane. [CHUCKLES] How old are you, doll? Uh, 17. 17, huh? Could I ask you a question? Why not? What I wanted to ask was, uh... Are you like, say a model? No, why do you ask? Oh, nothing. It's just that um... See, we used to have a model who lived in the building, you know? And... You kinda remind me. Oh, yeah? No, no, what I mean is... Well, you don't look like the other women around here. Oh? Yeah. Uh, how long you going to be with that, hm? Not long, about 10 minutes, maybe. I can fix it for now so to work. But I'll have to come back later and solder a wire. I have to get some solder. Hey, how'd you like some ice cream? I have a whole quart in the ice box. Okay? Okay, okay.Come on. Sit down. How about that? Good, huh? That's great. Yeah. Hey, you need a haircut, boy. Hasn't your mother told you? I haven't got a mother. She passed away when I was little kid. Oh, poor baby. Gee, I'm sorry. [CLICKS TONGUE] Well... I know what that feels like. I haven't got a father. I mean, I have but he walked out on us when I was just a little kid. My mother's still alive, though. Gee, it must be rotten not to have a mother. How do you know? I ought finish up in there, I guess. Sure you don't want some more ice cream? Don't be afraid to ask. No, thanks. That was fine. Whoosh! VITO: Uh, Miss Iris. Miss Iris, it's finished. I mean, it works now. I can come back this afternoon and... If you want, I have to get some solder. Good boy. Oh, wait a minute. See, uh, it's all set now. Only it's temporary. Like I said, you know I have to get some solder. Well, look that's wonderful. But don't come back this afternoon. You can do it tomorrow. I mean, if it works, that's all I care about. Here, you take this. Oh, no, no. Come on.You gave me ice cream. No. Come on. Oh, damn.Oh. IRIS: Now, you're trapped. Are you gonna take the five dollars? You have to buy the solder anyway? Okay.That's better. Well, I'll just... Look, I really don't... Okay. Uh... You know, I'll come back tomorrow. Alright, you call me first. Not before 11:00, okay? Okay. Hey, listen. VITO: Yeah. You forgot your gizmo here. Oh, well, I'll need it tomorrow. Hey, don't get drunk now. What? With all that loot. [CHUCKLES] Hey, I don't drink. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Hi. Anybody hungry? Go on, tear up a piece. Har har har de har har. [CHUCKLING] Laugh a minute. You are a slob. Hit him on the back. Hit him on the head, that's what I'll do. Don't make me laugh no more, honest. Well, where you been big shot? What happened? Your rich uncle die or something? Hey, is that a fresh mouth? VITO: You better watch it. I'll get my mob after you. Some mob, half of 'em's chocking to death. So, it went down the wrong pipe. So what did I do? Hey. Have a blast. Don't want any of your germs. Are you crazy? You can't get germs out of a soda. It's like alcohol. Hey, what do you say we go up to the roof and swap germs, huh? Who do you think you are, Vito Perugino? Coming in here like you own the place and starting in with your fresh mouth. So what's fresh? I said, "Let's go up to the roof." So, what that, your business? Hey, what do you got? Nose trouble? Mmm, I'd like to give you a crack in the face. ALICE: Big shot. Ugh, I'm getting sick to my stomach. Bye. I'm gonna watch Perry Como. You wanna come, Carol? All right. Well, what about you? You gonna come watch TV or you gonna stay here and help him? All right. Why do you have to holler? Hey, for you. VITO: Ah, it was too crowded around here anyway. How do you like that gall? Come on. Mmm, I hardly know you. What's to know? Anything... Anything you wanna know, I'll tell you. Well... I... I can't stay long. Come on. Come on. I don't like to look at other people's windows. It isn't nice. Who's looking at other people's windows?

Brother, I'm a great one to be giving you advice. You're at least married. Me, I've gone that route three times and it still hasn't panned out. As for affairs, please don't ask. I would... I'd just like to find a man. You know what I mean? Someone with guts. Somebody who really needs me, and at the same time has real guts, you know? [KNOCK AT DOOR] Just a minute. Well, for God's sake. Doll, look who's here. I brought your suitcase. I found it in the car. IRIS: I want to get an unlisted apartment. Okay, here you're here. Come on in. So I was just passing through the neighborhood, I had my car washed up at a place in 79th street and I figured, as long as I'm here why don't I... Oh, I'm sorry. IRIS: Shirley Rosencha, meet Mr. Wholesale. How do you do? Juley Franz, a personal friend. [CHUCKLES] Shirley, how are you? Honest, I'm sorry. If I had known you girls were having a hen party, I never would have come. I just thought it was a hot night, maybe you want to throw something on, we'll drive up to Westchester and have a drink or somethin'. Bring Shirley. Why not? Oh, no, no please. [STAMMERS] I'll go right back and watch channel four. Baby, why don't you take that suitcase into the bedroom? I'll fix you a drink. One. 'Cause you've got to beat it, I'm gonna wash my hair tonight. At least I got in under the wire. Listen. Look, if you want to go, I'll get right out. I don't want to stand in your way. It was nice enough for you to have me come over. No, no. Stay, okay? Here you go, Ju-Ju. Make it last. Thanks, doll. It was nice of you to ask, but no matter how you slice it, three's a crowd. My husband's out of town. Call up the super's boy. What's his name, Vito? How about that boy? Is that a good lookin' kid? Tear your heart out.[GIGGLES] Believe me. You think that's such a bad idea? If I were 10 years younger, if I were your age... Oh.Don't laugh. [CHUCKLES] Oh, is that a good looking boy. IRIS: So, live it up. Have a ball. After all, he's only a kid. Look at the favor you'd be doing him. Come to think of it, he could probably teach you a thing or two. [BOTH GIGGLE] Well, I have to go. Okay. MARY: I had a very nice time. Yeah. See you. What happened, hey? How far'd you get? Come on, huh? Did you get her going? Did she let you soul kiss her? Come on, I want to know. Come on, you want to help me? Look, ain't I your friend? Don't I tell you everything? All right, now look.

Oh, my God. What's the trouble? Nothing. I was just thinking how much I enjoy being in the park with you. [GIGGLES] What's so special about the park? It's just that I don't know much about them. My friends haven't been exactly park types. What do they do on their days off? Well, I'll tell you about it some other time. Hey, I'm famished. I'm famished and I want a sandwich. Look, food.

You and me, against the world. What a team. Oh. Hey, you know somethin'? When I look at you, and I see how beautiful you are. I don't see how it's possible to be so beautiful. Well... This wasn't supposed to happen. You know that? It was supposed to be a short act. I still don't understand it. [SIGHS] I'm so glad. You make me so proud of myself. Oh. You want to know something else? What? It's never been like this before. I don't think you can understand that. Never mind, it doesn't matter. I want you to know, what you do to me. The way you make me feel. Oh, my God. I never knew. Just remind the young man, that's a genuine Italian tie silk. It isn't meant for rough wear. Don't get all worked up about it. I intend to put it on him myself and also take it off. Are we past them? Yeah, the heat is off. You can come out now. Well, you know, they'd start ribbing me. Well, I'm sorry, I'd hate to damage your social standing. Oh, ho. [LAUGHING] [HUMMING] Ju-Ju... Yes, it is Iris. How are you, honey? What do you mean where I've been? I've been right here in my apartment, that's where. Only I haven't been going out at all. I've been holed up, trying to grow a beard. Hey, listen, would you take me to the beach tomorrow? I have somebody with me. The superintendent's boy. Don't be a smart aleck... He's a boy, you know, like your son at camp? He did me a favor. He fixed that lousy... ...air conditioner you gave me and I'd like to pay him back. He's a sweet kid. No, not one of those ducktails. He's kind of homely, that's all.What? Shh. What? What do you mean you can't hear me so good? It's because I'm lying down. On my bed, you owl. It wouldn't do you any good because I'm going to take a quiet nap. Yeah. Oh, about 10:00 or 11:00. Yes, yes, I will be ready. Yes. Yes. Shh... He'll be with me. Yes. You're an angel. Bye. You are... Now, wait just a minute. What do you mean I'm homely? What do you mean? You're homely. I'm not homely. [BOTH LAUGHING] Hey. [SIGHS] Ah, it pays to keep in condition. You never know when you're going to need it.Yeah. When you got your health it's like having money in the bank. Ah. That's what I always tell my son. You know I've got a boy almost your age? Yeah, I know, Iris told me. You and Iris are pretty good friends, huh? Yeah. Hey, I'm all sandy again. I'm just gonna jump in and wash it off. Gosh![LAUGHING] That's really great. You know what we ought to have? One of those long surf boards, you know, like they have in Hawaii. Oh, yeah, that's really an art. You know we used to do it every day when I went down there last year to Acapulco in Mexico. ten days. They used to do it right outside in front of our hotel. How about it, baby, you swim up a storm? Just horsing around. What do you say you go up and get out of those wet swimming trunks. You shouldn't sit around in those. What difference does it make? I'll dry off. Besides, I haven't got any other bathing suits. Then you'll just have to go up and borrow a pair of Juley's. It doesn't matter if they don't fit. Just till yours dry out. Oh, for God's sake. Boy, you ought to see that boy swim. Like an eel. I was just telling him I think he should go up and get out of those wet trunks. He can borrow an extra pair of yours up there, can't he? Sure, help yourself. Hey, look, why bother? Listen, he has lot of them. He buys them wholesale, like air conditioners. Why bother? Get smart kid, huh? You can't win a fight with a woman. You might as well give in, that's all. Take it from a guy who never tried and still lost. Come on, honey, I want to go up and get in to a suit, anyway. Okay, whatever you say. If you say change, I'll change. Change. Go, man. [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] Why didn't you tell me he was your boyfriend?Who? Are you kidding? He said you were down in the... Okadoka, I don't know, in Mexico last year. Look, honey, don't be silly. We're old friends. I've known him for years. Just because we were in Acapulco together, doesn't mean he's my boyfriend. Juley? Ha! He's like my brother, if I had a brother that is. And another thing. You know what I don't like? I don't like the way you keep needling him. Now that doesn't seem right. I... I don't know. It's not respectful. I don't exactly needle Juley, darling. He sort of asks for it. Well, now how does he ask for it? He takes us to the beach. He seems like a very nice guy. And you just keep making smart cracks. Look, honey, let's not argue, okay? I'll explain it to you some other time. In a way, I guess, I just can't help it. It sort of comes out. Well, I don't like it. It embarrasses me. You? Why? I don't know. Come on in. You go ahead and change. I'll wait here. Come on in, darling. Don't stand out there in a wet suit. Please, huh? Come on, I want you inside with me. Will you cut it out? For God's sake, there's people watching. VITO: Thanks, Mr. Franz. JULEY: You're welcome, son. Thanks, honey, I'll talk to you. Let me hear from you, honey. God, I'm tired. I've got such a headache. Honey, darling. Please, not now. Yes. Yes. Darling, please, I'm so tired. I don't feel like it. I want to. I've been wanting to all day. Please, baby. Please. I want you. I want you. IRIS: I'm sorry. Look, I had to call you. Ju-Ju, I got to get away. Just for couple of days. [STAMMERS] I know I sound dingy, calling you in the middle of the night, but... I know. Tomorrow afternoon or night, I don't care. Just for a couple of days. No, honest, I promise you, I won't be bored, I promise. No, no, please. Please don't ask me to explain. Just believe me, I'll tell you all about it tomorrow, huh? Ju-Ju, I've got to get away. I'm going out of my mind. Oh, are you a doll. You really are. And I'm such... I'm such a rotten kid. At 12:00. Ah, yes, I'll be ready. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Yeah? Oh, good morning. No, no, no trouble. Sure, one moment. It's your Madonna. Hi. Yes, sure. Yeah, I slept fine. Uh-huh. Oh? Sunday night?

Be back Sunday night. [YAWNING] Maybe, I can get in a little stick ball. Hey, Pa, you want to go to the ball game with me Sunday? She's going out of town? Yeah, just for a couple of days, I gave her my permission, you know. [CHUCKLES] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] How kind you are. How generous. That's me, papa, all heart. All heart, eh? That's not the word I had in mind. This woman is very good to you, isn't she? Yeah, I guess so. She loves you, do you understand? Yeah, Pa, sure, I understand. [SIGHS] I... It's hard for me to say, you know. She's...[SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Look, Vito, something I don't like. I don't want to see, eh? I don't want to see you become a wise guy. You understand? Okay, if maybe you want to act a little like a wise guy, you want to be smart. Eh? But not inside, eh? Don't make jokes with yourself. Inside, if you say you feel something, feel it. But don't laugh at it. Then, if you don't feel it, it's okay, too. But don't play with it, not inside. Sometimes, [CHUCKLES] I don't know I get a little scared, you know. Well, what are you scared? Well, it's just... Well, like you said, it's getting serious, you know, and... I'm just afraid that now I could... Well, I mean, I love her and all that but I'm just afraid that... You're afraid you've got to do something? And you don't know if you want to do anything? No? Yeah, I guess so.Well... Sooner or later you got to make up your own mind. Maybe she'll decide it for you. But I don't think so. I don't think so. Anyway, you're a good boy, Vito. Vitellone,a fine boy. Be a good man, too. Don't be a pig. [SIGHS] I suppose you know you passed out last night. What are you trying to do? Stay unconscious? So how was the golf? You win any money? Me, I always lose. It's more fun that way. If I didn't have to get dressed, I think I might try to peel you out of that bath towel. No, Ju-Ju, just hold me. Please just hold me. Oh, baby, do I want to hold you. Do you know it's been months... Yes, yes, I know. It wasn't any good then, and it isn't going to be any better now. So far as I'm concerned, nothing ever happened. You never got near me, you never will. It's like I'm dead. When you touch me, I'm dead. Is that clear? Oh, you little... Go on. You want to hit me? How'd I get myself involved like this? I'm a grown man, and I'm acting like... Well, I guess, that's it. We might as well break it off before we get to hating each other. You know, it's just one of those things. Yeah, I guess you're right. Honestly, Iris, there was so much I wanted to do for you. I wanted so much... What you're gonna do? I'm a nut, that's all. You're a nice guy and I'm a nut. Maybe if you... Maybe... Maybe if I went to a doctor, an analyst, maybe he could make everything all right? Well? You want to know something? You know what's got me so dingy? It's because I'm hung on a 17-year-old kid. Is that a laugh? Is that one for the books? And I mean hung, partner. Like all I want to do, is get home, so I can see his face. I can watch him eat and sleep. So I can smell his skin. You got a doctor that can fix that? Come on, Iris, you're kidding. You gotta be. You can't be serious. I am. I am. I am. I swear to God. We're going steady. [LAUGHING] Look, Iris, I'm not thinking about myself, but you just... Don't touch me! Don't touch me. Okay, I won't. I... Please. Please. I'm sorry. I won't bother you anymore. Take me home. I want him. I want my baby. [SOBS] Leave something for the Dodgers. Why do they have to have two leagues? They always had two leagues. Hey! [TIRES SCREECH] I didn't think you were coming back until tonight.JULEY: Hi, son. Hey, what do you say, Mr. Franz? Now you didn't tell me Juley was going' with you. What gives? Well, I just got back a little early, baby. I called Juley to come and get me. Please don't get angry. I just wanted to see you. Did you miss me? Yeah. Okay. Look, I... I got to go to the ball game. Well, can't it wait? I kind of wanted to talk to you. Well, now how can a ball game wait? No. I have to go. Really. Okay. What time will you be back? About 6:00, 6:30. Come on up when you get back, okay? All right. Hey, I'm sorry. That's all right, honey. I can manage. He has to go to a ball game. Iris, you break my heart. What can that coffee pot do for you that I can't? Huh? Speak, pale face. Hey, what's with youse? Why fore art thou bugged? Why fore? Well, I'm sore because, well, you said that Juley didn't mean anything to you and... Well, then I see you coming home with him. That's why I'm sore. Vito, darling, don't be a baby, huh? I told you we were just old friends. We have a lot of friends up there, and he was up there and I asked him to bring me home. [TELEPHONE RINGING] That's... That's all there is to it. After all, we're going steady, aren't we? You and me, all or nothing. [TELEPHONE CONTINUES RINGING] Come on, now. Wait a minute. Hello? Oh, for God's sake. Yeah, wait a minute. Honey, I'm gonna take this in the bedroom. [SIGHS] I thought you were dead. No such luck. Yeah, go on, I'm listening. Tomorrow night. Saturday night. No. Sunday nights are dark. No, no, no matinees. They wanted matinees, I said, no, absolutely no matinees. I already told you, who's gonna know it's Beryl Cobalt? We're gonna bill you as the Mystery Girl from Outer Space. Who's gonna recognize you? How are they gonna know? It's in a totally different act. I already had it made. I had to order it. Well, what can I do? I had to have it made. It'll fit, honey. It'll fit. I swear to God, it'll fit. No. No pictures out in front. No. I got you the best room in the hotel. The best. It'll be like you're in your own home, Iris. No. No newspaper publicity. Thanks, Iris. I mean it. Really, thank you. Tomorrow at 3:00. Hey, take a cab, and I'll pay the... [LINE DISCONNECTS] Hey, how are you there? Great house out there tonight, huh? Honey. What's the matter? What happened? Darling, I... I have to go away again. I... My mother's sick. I have to fly to St. Louis tomorrow. If it's all right, I'll be back in a week. I'm sorry. Is it bad? Hey, now come on. Now don't you worry about it. It's gonna be all right. And don't you worry about me. I mean, I know I've been kind of a big baby, but... I'll cut it out, okay? I love you, very much. I love you, too. MAN: ...the guys, but, uh, we won't bid on it, you know. A little blonde and a little brunette kid and... Get out of here. Oh, man, was she stacked. You know what I mean? Big deal, always making out with the women. Big shot. [INDISTINCT] VITO: Hey, what are you reading the paper for, all of a sudden? When did you learn to read? I'm reading "Dear Abby," I always read it. "Dear Abby"? Now what do you want to read that stuff for? It's letters. I like to read them. You know something? I never got a letter. In my whole life, nobody ever sent me a letter. In your whole life? No. So, that's why I read these. Hey, AI, who needs letters? Hey, Vito, you want to go to the burlesque show with us tonight? They got that blonde broad that lives in your building. How about that? What? Yeah, they got that gorgeous blonde with the big... Me and Dom and Fat Herman are going, do you want to come over? What? What are you talkin' about? I'm telling you. My brother, Sal, he goes over to Newark last night. He sees her. Madonna! He says she's so hot he almost dies on the ground. So help me God, that's what he said.What are you talking about? I'm not talking about. I'm telling you. Man, you've been holding out on us. Remember that big blonde broad lives in your building. She's a stripper.Hold on. I'm telling you, you've never seen nothing like it. Sal says, that when she comes out...Hold on, hold on, hey! All right, now. Now you just tell me what you're talking about? What are you talking about?What do you mean, what am I talking about? I'm telling you straight. The chick is a stripper, man. Sal says when she comes on... You're lying! I'm lying? Go on ask my brother, if you don't believe me, ask Sal. You're lying! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] You're lying! You want to fight, come on. You're lying! [BAND PLAYING] [MAN WHISTLING] [MUSIC STOPS] [ALL APPLAUD] [BAND STARTS PLAYING] [MEN WHISTLING] [BAND PLAYING IN DISTANCE] Wow, wow, wow, wow. You saw it all, eh? The big picture. Well, now you know. Why? Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I meant to. I didn't want you to find out like that. It isn't that I'm ashamed or anything, it's just... I didn't get around to it. I don't know. No guts. How about that? [CHUCKLES] Do you know what it felt like? I mean, you got any idea what it felt like? To hear Frankie and his brother, Sal, and all those men, all those men! Look, I'm sorry. Don't give me that whole routine, I've had it. What's a nice place like this doing in a girl like you. Look, it's an act. It's my living, you know. It's a business. But why do you have to do something so dirty? Why? When you were... Listen to me! When you were doing those things, it was like us. Like us, only it wasn't us. It was all those men. Now, why do you have to make that dirty? Please, no, tell me, why? You're not dirt. Vito, darling, listen. Try to understand. I didn't want you to see that. I was going to tell you, I swear, I was. It's not as if I were some cheap tramp. It's just an act. Oh, do you know what I'd like to do? I'd like to kill them. I'd like to get my hands on every one of them. Vito, I'm telling you, it's an act. There are 20 million women in this country putting on an act for their husbands every night. Why should I be ashamed? It's my living. I'm good. I'm damn good. It's like everything I thought, like everything I planned, like you spit on it, like you put dirt on it. I'm dirt, am I? Is that what I am? Is that what you came up here for, to make love to dirt? Is that what I've taught you and fed you, dirt? Am I just another cheap piece from now on, is that it? Iris, please don't say things like that. Please. Why not? I'm not a woman, I'm not a person. I'm just a stripper, isn't that it? Wouldn't you like to make love to a stripper? Wouldn't that be a kick? You could tell all your friends you made it with a stripper. Iris, please, please don't talk like that, you mustn't. I mustn't, what? Isn't this all you really want? Go on, take it. Don't talk like a whore! Don't talk like dirt! You call me dirt. You're like all of them. You're dirty. You're a dirty punk. A rotten little wop kid! Oh, no, no, no, no. [SOBS] [GRUNTS] Get out. Here we go. Come on. Get it off the wall. I got it! I got it! Hey, hey, let's go, come on. I got you, man. Hey, Pa. Yeah, Vito. Wait a minute, Pa. Let me give you a hand. It's all right, I can manage. You have a game with the boys, huh? Yeah, you know. Another few weeks, school starts. You've got to get yourself some new pants. By the way, you got a phone call this morning. While you were out. She called. She wants you to come to dinner tonight. I told her you'd call her. All right, I'll call her. If you want to go, you don't want to go, I don't care. Just let me know so I won't have to make supper. Okay? Yeah. You got a dime? You gonna call from the store? Yeah, I got a dime. Okay. Gee, I know, it's been a whole week. Yeah, I could have called. Well, why didn't you call me? Look, I... I can't... [SIGHS] I'm in the store, you know and I... Yeah, I guess so. Uh-huh. What time? No, I mean... What time do you want me? Uh-huh. Well, uh, I gotta play ball, and I gotta help my father, you know. Yeah. [SIGHS] Okay. I... Yeah, I guess. I'll take this one, too. Oh, what do you wanna say that for? Well, it's embarrassing. I'm in the... I'm in the store. Yeah. [STUTTERS] Okay, okay, goodbye. Oops! Oh! [CHUCKLES] I'm sorry. Could I have a can of peas? You're a fresh one. I'm a fresh one? Hey, what do you say there? I almost didn't recognize you with that glamorous sun tan. Where you been, Florida? Florida, at this time of the year? No. Well, I'll see you around. No, keep it. Hey! Uh... You live around here? I sure do, on the other side of the avenue. Uh-huh. Well, I was just wondering if, uh, you were in the book? Well, why don't you try me and find out? Okay, sure. Oh, by the way, if you're not doing anything tonight, my parents are going out early. We could watch TV alone. Well, what time? They're going out about 7:00. Why don't you make it about 7:30? Uh... I mean, if you think you're up to it. No. It's just, you see, I got kind of a date. Then let's forget about it. Forget I ever mentioned it. If you think I'm gonna be a late date for you, Vito Perugino, you're out of your trick mind. All right. Now wait a minute. You're not talking to just another kid, you know. Wait, come on. Oh, what're you getting all steamed up about? Come on. It's just that I have to go somewhere for dinner, see? I mean... Now listen, I'll be through about 8:30. Now is that okay? I mean, it's just something I have to do. It isn't really a date. All right with you? You mean, with your actress friend? Aw, come on, now where do you get that actress jazz? She's not an actress, she's... Anyway, will you do me a favor? You just forget it, huh? It's just a lot of talk about nothing. I'll tell you about it sometime. Well, what do you say? Too bad. I was kind of hoping it was more than talk. Anyway, you come whenever you want, Vito. I'll be ready for you. [EXCLAIMS] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Hi! You're early. Dinner'll be a little while, yet. You look great. It's all right. Uh, come on in. Hi. Hi. [CHUCKLES] You look so... I don't know, you look different. Well, I ran across this new book, you see, it's called Little Women. Little...[CHUCKLES] Are you kidding me? Yes, I'm kidding you. Sit down, I'll pour you some sherry. No, I don't... Wine, not booze. Don't worry, I'm not gonna start that business all over again. Have a go? No, I'm still trying to... You look so... I don't know you look different. You look now like you live here. Well, that's what you get for stepping out of character. Pow! Right in the kisser. I was... I was just trying to show you that I can look like any other woman. Personally, I'd rather not. But if I want to, I can. I'm sorry. It went over like a lead balloon. So, what else is new, to coin a phrase? Just, you know, horsing around. Played some ball over in the park and on 65th street. Let's face it. You're still sore at me, aren't you? You still feel as if your little world collapsed? Iris, no, I'm not sore. Honest, I'm not. I don't know, I got hot and then I cooled off. That's about it, isn't it? You cooled off. Well, you can't fight that, can you? I'm sorry. Ah, it's all right, honey, forget it. I ought to have my head examined. What did I expect? What could I expect? It's just that... While it lasted, it was so good. So good. Gee, now I'm getting embarrassed and I... I don't know what to say. Forgot it, doll. You don't have to say anything. Man, if I'm going to play this scene I've got to do it on something stronger than sherry. Now you're talking. I had a long talk with your father this morning. I wish I'd done it before. He's a real nice guy. You're lucky. Yeah, he's a good joe. It makes us even. I never had a father and you never had a mother. We're just a pair of poor orphans. And I... I think I'm going to cry. I'm gonna try not to, but if I don't make it... Beat it, will you? Iris, I'm sorry, I just... [EXHALES] Go on, split. Iris... No. Oh, Iris, don't... I wish we didn't have that fight. Honest, I wish we didn't. [SOBBING] Everything seemed to get all smashed up and broken. [SOBS] It doesn't matter. It was just crazy, insane. We had our laughs and we had a lot... Hey, look, do me a favor, will you? Just go. All right, if that's what you want. Vito, Vito. [SOBS] I don't want to bug you or embarrass you, but it was the truth. I really did love you. I do. I'm mad, but I do. [SOBS] I'll see you around. Sure, champ. [CHUCKLES] Around. [SOBBING]
