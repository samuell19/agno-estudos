Hi! Hey!ALICE: Sorry I'm late. No!ALICE: Rude. It's fine.WAITER: Ladies. Hey.Hey. Um, we'll have a bottle of the chardonnay and three glasses, please. Sure.ALICE: Oh, no. Actually, a vodka soda for me, thank you. Uh, the waiter's in love with you. I mean, I really feel like he does not know the definition of the word "boundaries." Yeah, because he sent you, like, 14 dick pics. Oh, and... he waxes. Wow.SOPHIE: Yeah. No!Like, the whole... Really? But why? I don't know. Oh. Alice's guy from the swim team? Okay, we don't have to talk about Dolphin Dave. I want to have a nice night, thank you very much. Like, I don't think that shaving his body hair was gonna make the difference between Olympic trials or not. Oh, God. Sorry. Okay.Thank you. Oh, thank you!You're very welcome. Sophie. The bottle. And vodka soda. Oh. Yeah, you're welcome. He's obsessed with you.Sophie, stop. You don't see it? Don't tell me you don't see it. I have a boyfriend. Sophie, leave her alone. Yes, thank you. Sorry, it's just Simon. Um, actually, he has a gallery opening on Friday, he wanted me to invite both of you guys.Oh! That'd be great. That... Yeah. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah, definitely. I just know there's, like... collectors coming and so he was saying how much he would love to introduce you. Well, I'm not really working in traditional media anymore. Oh. That's amazing, that's awesome. It's new, we'll see. Yeah. Uh... Well, cheers. Cheers. Good to see you.You too. Okay, so, for my birthday...Yes. No. No, no. Your 30th. We were thinking the three of us could go to my parents' house up north. Don't worry, Don and Sylvie are in Florida, so they will not be gate-crashing the party. Okay.You're gonna come, right? You gotta come, it's gonna be fun. And I demand it. I will definitely see. Oh.I should just go soon. Hello? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd be so jumpy. How was your night? I liked your picture. Just one, huh?We were at dinner! Well, we're home now. Oh, you must be feeling bad this morning. Feeling bad? I'm feeling good, but I didn't go hard on the cocktails last night. I did not go... Never just a quiet night with them two, is it? No. Do you want a cardamom bun or a Danish? I thought we were cutting back on sugar. Well, we are, but, you know, we're good all through the week, we can treat ourselves every once in a while, can't we? Okay, whatever looks good. Excuse me, can I just get two coffees... Yeah, it just came up. Just came up. Just came up. Do you remember that sales thing? Well, I think it'd be bad if I missed it. Oh, so Colleen texted me. Okay. Good to see you, take care, bye! Yeah, it just came up. They never remember me in there. Like, I come in here every week, it wouldn't kill them to say hello. They're so weird in there. Okay, what do you want? Danish looks all right. It looks like fresh out of the oven. Oh, so Colleen texted me this morning about that sales thing, Do you remember this thing I told you about? Well, anyway, it turns out now they do need me to go. Why? Just, I came up, I guess. I mean, it's gonna be boring, you know? A trip to Minneapolis, but I think it'd be bad if I missed it. I guess you just give me the impression that you didn't really care about that job. I think you can do better than that. A blank canvas can be intimidating. How do you get started? Uh, experimentation, you know. Well, you know, I try to be free with it. I just... I'm boring myself. I show everything to Alice at a very early stage. Oh, I'll be right back. Hi!Oh, my God. Oh, God, I feel like a potato. You couldn't be a potato. You look nice, though. Oh, yeah. Simon got it for me. It's expensive. Uh, where's Tess, I thought you were gonna come together? Um, so, she's... Okay, she's not coming. It's just... yeah, she said she would, so I put her on the list, and I...I know. It's fine, it's fine.You know what she's like when it comes to work stuff.I know. She gets all in her head and... you know. I'm sorry. It's fine.Hey! Hi, Sophie.Hi! Thank you! Oh, my God, I need this. You learn pretty quick that the non-profit world, it attracts nearly as many narcissists and sociopaths as, like, the corporate sector does, so... Well, I think that what you do is amazing. I do, I do. I think it's incredible. It's like a million times more important than any of this, but...Oh, my God. Thanks for coming anyway. Stop it, this is amazing. Congratulations.Thank you. Thank you for inviting me. I hope it's a huge success. I'm so glad you could make it, it's great to see you. Thank you. Hey! Mmm. Mini pork bun?Oh, I'm fine. You sure?I'm fine. Alice, Uber's here.I'm sorry we didn't get to hang out all night.It's okay. It's a big night for him. So, you are gonna come to the cottage, right?I promise, I promise. Alice!I'll see you tomorrow, good night. I love you.Come on. Let's go!Goodnight. Love you, too. It was a complete fucking train wreck. No one even showed up. There were, like, a hundred people there. I'm talking about important people. You still don't understand this business. it's cutthroat. If people aren't coming to your shows, it's because you're washed up. You have to be the best or you're nothing. You are the best. You are to me. Oh, my love. I wish you could see what I see. My perfectionist. You're so brilliant. You're amazing. Hey. Hmm. Hey! Thank you. ♪ You're like a bomb ♪ And I'll never be the same ♪ My heart just blown away ♪ In the middle of the day ♪ You're like a bomb Sophie, um, can you pull over? You okay? Fuck. Sorry, guys. You okay?Yeah. - Oh, God. - Oh, no. I shouldn't have looked at my phone, it's my bad. You're all right. All right.TESS: I want birthday pancakes with real syrup.SOPHIE: Okay. Then leave the fake stuff. We got maple syrup right here. All right.SOPHIE: Okay. You want chocolate chip pancakes? Of course you do. Okay. Two. And s'mores. Ooh, S'mores! Good idea. Okay. I think it's just crazy. You can't let a girl like that wander around doing whatever she wants. I mean, of course, she's gone missing. Parents have no rules anymore. My kids know exactly what kind of hell there'd be to pay if I caught them sneaking around like that. I mean, why would she put herself in that situation? Shotgun. What's a yoga bro? You know, it's those super muscular guys that have to grunt their way into every pose. It's totally performative.SOPHIE: Right. And they have to fight their way to the front of the class so everybody can see their balls hanging. All right. Thank you. Oh, your dad finally fixed the screen door. Yeah, he did it when he opened up. Got it.SOPHIE: Thank you. Okay. All right. You can put that there. And then through here. Okay, Tess, you're in my brother's room. Alice, you're in my room at the end. Great.SOPHIE: Yeah. Hmm.SOPHIE: Remember these? I love how your mom never changes anything about this place. All right. Thank you. You're right. Why... Why... Why have I stopped having sleep orgasms? That's normal for you? In your sleep to... I like a free orgasm. Me, too. Oh, my God. Wouldn't have to put in any work. I had a sex dream the other night. Oh? No. I mean, it was bad. Oh.It was... It was with the, um... the waiter from the wine bar. He's hot.Ugh. Like, I shouldn't be having sex dreams about someone else when I'm with Simon. Oof. Who told you that? No one, that's just how I feel. Um, I'll clear... Alice. Alice. Alice! Look at me. You don't want me? I'm just tired. Listen. If you don't want to fuck me, you don't want to fuck me. Alice. Alice? Will you come join us? Sure. I don't know, I mean... I don't... Hey, everyone, you are listening toHurdle. I am so, so excited to bring you today's episode because I am chatting with my dear friend... ...core values, and we're living and breathing them every day in our lives. That's what makes us feel most fulfilled. Right. So if you can begin your day like that, so it's not own your morning, a.k.a., like, do as much as possible within, like, a three-hour time span starting at 4:00 a.m. Correct. But they're owning your morning by giving you and yourself, and your mental health, and your soul what it needs. Hi there. Have you seen this girl? Andrea Evans. No, uh, we just got here yesterday. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. You keep that, there's a hotline you can call if you've seen anything. Search parties leave at 8:00 every morning from the church, if you could spare the time. Yeah, okay. Uh, thank you. Or, good luck. Take care. Double word score. Wow. "Door." Wow, well done. You are making this too easy. My turn. All right. All right. That was rude. You really did it. Don't be mad. What? No.SOPHIE: Yes! Hey, Gossip Girl, we need a second opinion. Uh, what is it? "Quakey." Uh, maybe. We'll take that as a yes, so that is twenty-one, double word score. Wait, why Gossip Girl? I don't know, the phone, the hair. You are aware that popular culture has evolved over the last decade.TESS: And? Maybe your references are getting a little bit stale. Yeah?TESS: Mm-hmm. A reboot? With who? Hey. Um... so I think I'm gonna have to leave early. I know, it's just, work is really intense right now. Seriously? We're here for my birthday. I... Yeah, I... Sorry, I... I don't really expect you to understand. You're right, I don't understand. I was under the impressionthat we took the week off so that we could spend it together. What are you taking the week off from? I'm sorry, does my work not count because I don't get paid for it? Of course, your work counts, Tess. Your work is amazing. Sophie, that's not what we're talking about right now. Hey.Hello. Guess what I brought? What? Fireworks for Tess' birthday. It's a surprise so don't say anything. Why are you doing all this for her? I think you should cut her some slack. This is a... It's a milestone of a birthday, and I think that she is a little nervous 'cause... she thinks that she should be further along. I think she would expect to be at Simon's level right now, not that she would admit that. Anyway, I thought we could have a picnic at that little island across the lake. Yeah, I don't want to be in a boat with her right now. Stop it, it'll be fun. Sophie, I'm serious. Maybe this is just about our friendship not being what it used to be.Whose friendship? Mine and Tess'. I don't think you're being fair. Anyway, we all think our worst thoughts at night. You will not think this way in the morning. Andrea! Andrea! Andrea! I haven't let the girls leave the house in days. They're on the verge of mutiny. If she's hurt, it's probably someone she knows. Andrea! Andrea! Listen, forget about the history. We talked about this over and over. You've told me you can't be your real self around them. When you've seen them, do you have a good time or not? Why do you put yourself through this? Do you feel better or worse? And I think you already know what you have to do. And there is a really easy solution, you don't need them in your life anymore. It's tough, I know it's tough. Part of growing up is knowing when to let go. Hey, you missed a really fun day. Hey, where were you? I went out with one of the search parties. Hmm. Did you find her? No. So, definitely worth missing spending the day with us, then. All right, I need some help at the wood shed, can you help me out?Mm-hmm. Thank you. Fuck me! Okay, lesson number one. This is a maul. I never want to hear you call it an ax, okay? So look for the natural splits in the wood, get your distance. Feet like so.Okay. And when you swing, you want this hand to fall in line with this hand. So, like... Okay. Got it?Yeah. Wow. You're good.Well, that was hardly anything. Okay. Nice. Shit. Alice? I think we have enough. No, it's fine. Yeah. Thanks. You just pretend to be this meek little victim. You sit there with this placid look on your face. I'm here trying to get through to you, I'm actually asking you to do something. This is exactly what you do. This is exactly what you do. I'm tired... of carrying you. ♪ You say ♪ I only hear what I want to ♪ You say ♪ I talk so all the time ♪ So ♪ And I thought what I felt was simple ♪ And I thought that I don't belong ♪ And now that I am leaving ♪ I thought that I did something wrong ♪ 'Cause I missed you ♪ Yeah, yeah Alice. Come on. Come on. All right. Okay. Hey. I want you. Whoo! All right! Come on, Sophie! Tess!TESS: Good morning!SOPHIE: Tess. And then what happens to your body, it goes into starvation mode and you feel compelled to eat... But, like... like, a super a lot. Super a lot, got it. You're gonna give us diabetes. I'm making cinnamon rolls, I can't do it without sugar. You know it's more addictive than cocaine, right? Yeah, obviously. Cocaine isn't even that good. You know, I remember a time when you used to like sugar. Yeah. There's just all this research now on how it, like, corrodes your organs and stuff, so. Hmm. What? I... I just know what disordered eating looks like. Is this better?Alice, what are you doing? I mean, if you think I should have more, I can just keep going. Stop! Alice, stop!Is something wrong? I'm fine! I'm fine!Stop, Alice! Hey, baby. Yeah, no, I can hear you. What's going on? I have no idea. ...your friends, and that you're actually at a cottage. So you... you lied to me. Yeah. No, I know. This is just classic bullshit. Like, why would you tell me that you're going on a road trip when you... I don't know why. I know. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I love you. Who was that? Uh, just Simon. He needs me. What? Why?You're kidding. No.What, he can't figure out how to turn the dishwasher on? When did he become more important to you than us? Jesus Christ, Tess! Not everything's about you. Me? Are you serious? I can't believe she's talking about leaving. Yeah. She could have stayed for my birthday. It's... frustrating. We're having a good time, right? When did she become such a flake. I love you, Alice. Did you take my stuff? Cinnamon bun?Tess. What stuff? My phone and my wallet. I know you have them, come on. Why would I take your phone and your wallet? You know why.I want to hear you say it. Sophie went to the store and... hm, you and I need some alone time. That's the last thing that we need, man. Okay, come on. You know me better than that. I'll never forgive you, just so you know. I'll tell you where they are if you come out on the paddle board. Oh, my God. Should we play a game?ALICE: Like what? Stand up.Why? Come on, it'll be fun. Come on, fight back. Come on! Christ, Tess. Ugh! What is wrong with you? I didn't think you were gonna fall in. You were sitting down. Can you help? Yeah, it's freezing! What? What?My earring! Fuck!Well, it's gone now. Simon gave me those earrings. What are you doing? It's like 30 feet deep here. You can't see shit down there. Alice! Stop it. Alice! Alice! What are you doing? I can't... I can't... I can't...Can't what? I can't do another thing wrong. Fuck.Alice. I can't do another thing wrong. Alice, what does that even mean? No, I lied to him. He doesn't even know that I'm here. What?I mean, he does now. He called. Well, why did you lie to him? Because I'm bad. What? He wouldn't love me if he knew how bad I am. Jesus, is that something that he tells you? You're such a fucking cunt sometimes. Alice? Alice? Alice, is it?No! Just... no. Hey. Why do you let him pull this shit with you? He's not... He's not pulling anything. I lied to him, he has every right to be angry. You lied? About what? Just... about being here. Alice, you can't tell your supposed life partner that you're going to go on a trip with your best friends and somehow that's your fault. I can't think of a bigger red flag than that.ALICE: It's not... Hey, can we just approach this without judgment? Are you seriously telling me that you have no opinions about this? Of course I do, but Alice is a grown woman. Yes! And I don't know how any of this is your business.When you're friends with somebody, it means you care about the other person. But I guess that's a concept Simon managed to erase from your brain along with the rest of your personality.Tess, stop it. Maybe this is my personality and I'm changing, and you're the shitty friend for not, like, letting me change. We're not all content to, like, flip between projects. Some of us have real adult lives. Fucking a 40-year-old does not make you an adult. He's 37. Yeah, he's a fucking clown. And he's got this stupid, smarmy accent and his art is... self-indulgent, derivative garbage. You're just jealous because he's successful and you're... I'm what? Simon loves me. I'm happy. Is this what you think love is? What would you know? You've never been in a serious relationship. Romantic love isn't the only kind of love. Only boring people think that. Okay, cool. I guess I'm boring then. Well, I mean, if the shoe fits. I didn't say it. God, I can't stand you right now! I can't stand you right now! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Alice? Please, please go away. Please go away. Please go away. Please go. Please go. Alice?Please go away, please! Andrea! Andrea! Hello? Andrea? I'm assuming you don't care that I was worried. Can I come in? I guess. I made you a sandwich in case you're hungry but don't want to admit it. Thank you. Sophie's gone looking for you. I think she's pissed at us. I'm sorry that I made you worry. You good? I don't want to go home. Then we'll stay. Sophie back yet? No. This ax is a piece of shit. That's actually a maul. Ugh, great. Thank you for that. "She felt very young, "and at the same time unspeakably aged. "She sliced like a knife through everything. "She had a perpetual sense of being out, out, "far out to sea and alone. "She always had the feeling that it was "very, very dangerous to live even one day." I like you reading me to sleep. You were gone a while. I needed some space. You know, this trip isn't just about you, Tess. You make me sound like a bully. Well... I'm not a bully! Oh, my God, stop! Wow. Now that is cleared up, who would like a donut? Hot Chocolate? Yes, please.Yeah. How did Simon know you were here? He looked at my email. He never would have let me come. What? Yeah, he checks things sometimes. Alice. I know. He always has a reason. I take my phone into the bathroom with me now when I shower. Andrea! Andrea! Andrea! I know this sounds crazy, but sometimes it feels like... like he can read my mind, and, like... if he can do that, then... there's nowhere left that I can actually be alone. I never know what's going to make him angry, so I spend all this time trying to be good, trying to think of ways to be better. Like if I could just purify my thoughts. But you can't. I mean... it's never good enough. I... I don't know. But he doesn't hurt me or anything, you know? He doesn't hurt you? I really wish you would have told us this sooner. I didn't know what to say. ♪ Happy birthday to you Happy birthday! Wow! Oh, you're a wise old lady now. Uh, I have always been a wise old lady. In spirit, at least. I'm just gonna go for it. Uh, I'm sorry, but I don't think this is enough chocolate chips. Whoa.Excuse me? Is this how you treat people on their birthday? That's a good chip-to-pancake ratio. Oh, my God. We should go out tonight. Is there even anything around here? Maybe the place near the food mart. I just don't know if it's open this early in the season. I could check if I had my phone. Do you want it back? No. Not yet. What will he do if he doesn't hear from you? I'm not sure. I could text him and tell him that you got hit by a bus. Oh, my God, Tess. Oh, happy birthday!Happy birthday! Happy Birthday!To me. To you! Oh, Jesus. Ugh! No, I... I feel like I got one. Don't say that! No, in sympathy. In sympathy. I don't really have one, but I just need to pee all the fucking time. Needing to pee and having a UTI is not the same thing. Yeah, it is! It's like Cystitis and, like... Cystitis?ALICE: Oh, she's smart. I need to pee. So, you know. Ugh. Do you guys know what?SOPHIE: What? Hey.SOPHIE: What? ♪ You say ♪ I only hear what I want to Come on, sing it. ♪ You say ♪ I talk so all the time ♪ So ♪ And I thought what I felt was simple ♪ And I thought I don't belong ♪ And now that I am leaving ♪ Now I know that I did something wrong ♪ Yeah, I missed you ♪ You say ♪ Dying since the day they were born, yeah ♪ ...but I'm thrown ♪ And I thought I'd live forever ♪ Now I'm not so sure You try to tell me that I'm clever ♪ But that won't take me anyhow Oh, yeah ♪ Or anywhere with you ♪ You said that I was naive ♪ And I thought that I was strong ♪ I thought, "Hey, I can leave, I can leave."

"Alice. Alice... "You'll regret that when you get on the scale in the morning. "You are going to get fat if you keep eating like that." What, do I just light it? This was your idea. That doesn't mean I know how to do it. Just, I don't know, light the string thing. This thing?ALICE: Yeah. Gosh. Oh, my God. I feel like garbage. You asked the waitress for birthday shots. Remember that drink you used to make us? Which one?Gin and Smirnoff Ice. Ugh. Oh, that must be egg guy. Egg guy? Oh, you should come. He's guaranteed to have, like, a duck or a kitten with him. I like cats. Oh. There's my girl. Missed you. I didn't know you were coming. I've been calling and calling. Well, the service is pretty bad up here. Your Instagram feed says otherwise. Well, I'm sure Alice will explain it all to me later. Jesus fucking Christ. Alice, will you stop fussing? I can... It's... It's fine. I guess I got too much, eh. I hope no one was desperate for olives. This is kind of a girls trip, Simon. We weren't expecting you. What, are we telling ghost stories? Alice was missing me, so I thought I'd swing by. Tess. And Sophie.Thanks. Your favorite, my love. Thank you. Jeez, are you sure you're not trying to give us mad cow disease, Simon? Would you like me to put yours back on, Tess?It's fine. It's really not a problem.It's fine. Sorry. Well, cheers. Cheers. I was pretty worried about you when I didn't hear back from you. You know, I heard about the girl who went missing. Yeah. They didn't find the guy who killed her yet. Why would you just assume that she's dead? I'm not assuming. The checkout clerk couldn't stop going on about it. Um, I found... this thing out of that cottage. It's just weird. It might be hers, it might mean something. What, this? Alice, darling, I... I really don't think anyone's gonna care about this. No, probably not. You look different. No, it's the hair, I think. Yeah, it's very... bohemian. My beautiful girl. Hmm. You didn't tell me you were living in the lap of luxury. But then there's lots of things you didn't tell me. I mean, how are we supposed to be happy together if we can't trust each other? Are you sorry for what you did? It's completely destabilizing when you do shit like this. It derails my work. I know, I'm sorry. I just... I... I'm trying to work out why you would choose to hurt me so deliberately.I just... No. I... I mean, I just wanted to hang out with my friends.Right. I wasn't...So you wanted to be here with them at my expense. You're incredibly selfish. Come here. Come on. I haven't even got to properly kiss you yet. Just let me brush my teeth. Should... Actually I need to get up as soon as possible in the morning so we can get out of here. I can't wait to get home. You're leaving? Uh, I have to. Yeah. You know that. Be home soon. Ah... God, they take themselves so fucking seriously, don't they? Look at this guy. Come on, man. Maybe I should get out and push. Sophie! What the fuck. What the fuck are you doing? Look what you've done to my fucking car! What... What the... What is wrong with you? Alice. Alice, come on. Get in the car. Alice. Alice. No. Jesus Christ. Come on. Mm. We should get going. Let's just... Come on, put the fucking ax down. It's a fucking maul, Simon. Can you put the maul down? Alice? I know you're very emotional. In fact, I came out here because I was worried. She said no. Alice? Just... Hey. Hey. Alice, let's just, uh... just take a breath. Just get in the car. Come home. You've always said they don't really know you. You're so full of shit. Alice. It's just... It's you and me, come on. It's just us. Let's go home. We can work through this. I'm trying to prove I'm someone who really loves you. Let's just forget about all of this, it doesn't matter. She said no. Why don't you shut your fucking mouth? And stay the fuck out of this! Back off! It's okay. Fuck this. I give it a week. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Sometimes I get a... a word or a saying stuck in my head. Like a... phrase that keeps surfacing, and it will just repeat itself again and again and again until it's all I can hear. And for a while, it was this voice asking me... "What are the chances? "What are the chances? What are the chances?" What are the chances of what? Um, I don't know. Maybe... what are the chances I don't come out on the other side? What are the chances I don't want to? And lately, it's, um... someone asking me, "Where will you put your shame? "Where will you put your shame?" And it's my voice, but it isn't. You can give it to us. Here. Did it work?
