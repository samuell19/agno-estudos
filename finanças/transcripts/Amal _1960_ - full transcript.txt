In days of old a fertile field, today a dead land Eroding the slopes, tearing apart the rich soil The streaming water has devastated this country in less than one lifetime It has left little but gaping chasms everywhere. Here, day in, day out, the cattle forage, seeking their meager nourishment. Death of the earth, death of the vegetation, death of the animals... And men? In the name of the forgiving and merciful God, praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds; merciful benefactor, Sovereign of the Day of Judgment And there, in this dying land, the people live all day, every day in an unending wait. ... "Lead us in the straight path, the path of those to whom You have given Your favors and not in that of the lost and unknowing." And, near the cemetery, a pile of rocks which people take to make a meager tomb when a death occurs. Rocks are gathered each day, and added to the pile so that it is always ready. Only the children have not yet learned to wait. They are still living in the discovery of the world, and always find one way or another to enjoy themselves. This little boy is called Amal. His father would have preferred that he be called Abdel-Khader, Ibrahim or Gadour but his mother refused, for it was "Amal" which she liked and that is how the child was named... Amal's parents had had four children before him and when Amal was old enough to go outside the hamlet they were all dead and Amal scarcely remembered them. All that remained were a young brother and a little sister still in her mother's arms. And for Amal life was full of wonders... And the most astonishing of those were the stories his grandfather told him... And each story took place on the other side of the mountain, where the sun set, where the clouds came from. "The mountain over there?" asked Amal. "Yes, yes, that one or another." A seabird flew over their heads. "That too, grandfather?" asked Amal. "Oh, yes, that too comes from the other side of the mountain.” And Amal wondered what it could be, this other side of the mountain. Previously, before the birth of Amal, the hills surrounding the hamlet were fertile enough to supply the simple needs of the people. They worked their land as their ancestors had. From top to bottom, from top to bottom, always... And each year they became aware of one thing: that the land yielded less, and lost its rich color - that each rainfall dug into this land crevices so deep that they uncovered rocks. And people carried them one by one to the cemetery. Because, with the impoverishment of their land, people themselves were dying more and more often ...Especially the children. Amal often accompanied his father to the fields. He admired him, and wished one day to be like him. And when his father examined the earth, Amal did likewise. And then, he would run to the bottom of the hill where large areas of smooth earth were to be found, having been carried there by the rain. And there, Amal liked to sketch all that he had seen in his world of the hamlet... Sheep tearing at the grass... Cows with their ribs jutting out... ...His father who worked his from top to bottom, from top to bottom, always... And each time it rained, Amal knew that the water running down the slopes would carry some deposits of smooth earth and that there would still be some fine sketches to make. One day a car drove along the hamlet's only road... The man who drove it went up to his father in the fields ...And Amal heard the visitor say to his father with a lot of gestures that he was working his slope the wrong way. That he ought not to work from “top to bottom” but crossways, in the direction which would prevent the water from storms digging those deep crevices. That they would become $0 many gaping ravines - like those which already surrounded the hamlet ...And his father nodded Yes, Yes Yes, continually. And they shook hands once... twice, and the man also shook hands with Amal's pal. Then, he came to shake Amal's hand... And Amal thought it would be fun to sketch one day, in the smooth earth, a man who shook hands so much... And he asked his grandfather: “Where did he come from, this man?” “Ah, yes, he too, came from the other side of the mountain.” One day, Amal hoped to see for himself the other side of the mountain. Several days later when getting up in the morning Amal found himself all alone. He did not see his mother or anyone else... There, before his grandfather's door, with another woman from the hamlet, her little girl in her arms, his mother stood motionless and speechless. And since no one was concerned with his presence, Amal thought that this was the chance that he sought, the moment to go see what there was on the other side of the mountain. It was not at all as his grandfather had described it. He did not see any seabirds, nor any mean who shook hands, nor a place where the sun sets... He saw rich and fertile land... rows of trees... terraces... people, cultivating their slopes a little like the man who came by car had explained to his father. However, he did not see any small deposits of earth and he wondered what children did in order to make drawings. It was impressive all the same. But he thought that, after all, his grandfather had never seen the other side of the mountain. In returning home, late in the afternoon, he had collected a rock next to the cemetery with the others... But the pile of rocks was no longer there. There were three boys sitting there, who snickered when they saw them. “Your mother has been looking for you all day long.” “You'll get a scolding.” ...And Amal ran off. Amal did not understand anything of what he saw. He did not know that there would no longer be any stories about what happened on the other side of the mountain. He did not know that there, not so far from the other side of the mountain, his grandfather was dead. Returning to the hamlet Amal found his mother again, hugging her little daughter to her breast, without moving, without noticing his presence. It began to rain. Amal count only think about this marvelous rain, which would surely bring new deposits of earth in his father's field, and where he could sketch everything that he had seen on the other side of the mountain.
