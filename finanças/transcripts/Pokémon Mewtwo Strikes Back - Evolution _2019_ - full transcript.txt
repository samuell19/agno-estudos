The phantom Pokémon Mew... {do we still want to use phantom, even in a remake done long after mythical has been properly defined? --Puto}{Since the PROBLEMATIC LINE at the end still remains... Yes. -Starfish} They say it's extinct, but even in recent times, there have been reported sightings of Mew. Unconfirmed sightings. Yes... Nobody's ever gotten a single good photo of it. Unfortunately true. This is Mew. It's said to not only possess divine power, but it may have also caused a cataclysmic flood... ...or done something to turn barren lands fertile so the people could grow crops. Is it an angel, or a demon? Or is it simply capricious? Whatever the case, it undoubtedly wields great power. This is the fossil we just excavated on our latest expedition. A part of Mew's body... Or so we believe. Let's bring it back to the laboratory at once. If it truly is a Mew fossil... Yeah... We may be able to create the mightiest Pokémon. What is this place? Who am I? Who are you? I... ...cannot forget this world they've flown off to. Who am I? Why am I here? No... All that matters is that I exist. As of yet... ...I have not been born into this world. Mewtwo is finally awake! "Mewtwo"...? Telepathy? Mewtwo. That's you. We created you from the Pokémon said to be rarest in the world! Indeed... Behold the rarest Pokémon in the world: Mew! "Mew"...? Is that my progenitor? My father? My mother? In a sense, but not quite. You were based off Mew, but we've created you to be much stronger! By whom? You say neither a father, nor a mother... So then by God? Is God the one who created me? The only beings capable of creating life in this world are God and humans. So it was you? Humans created me? This is a scientific breakthrough! We finally have proof that we were right! We can continue our research! Let's start on the next model! Congratulations! We finally did it! Who am I? What is this place? What was the purpose of my birth? To create the mightiest Pokémon in the world... That was our dream... Is this power my own? Am I truly the mightiest Pokémon in the world? Mew... Am I stronger than you? You may very well be the mightiest Pokémon in the world... But a more powerful entity exists here, too. Humans? If you join forces with us humans, the world will be ours. The world will be ours...? But if your power is left unchecked, the world will be brought to its knees. You must control your power. "Control"? Are you content to rely on brute strength alone and allow the world to burn like you have this island? What should I do? Restraining my power with this armor that protects my being... What is it that you want me to do? It's simple, really. Just do as everyone else has done on this planet. Everyone? Fight, destroy, and plunder. The strong succeed here. Where am I? Who am I? For what purpose do I fight? Why am I alive? You're a Pokémon. Pokémon live for humans: to be used by them. So you mean to say I should fight for you? That I should fight for humans? You're a Pokémon created by humans. What other worth could you have? "Worth"? Who am I? Why am I alive? What are you doing? Do you intend to defy humankind? Humans may have created me... But I am no human... As an artificial creation, I am not even a true Pokémon! Who am I? What is this place? Who asked that I be born? Who wished for my creation? I resent everything that led to my birth. So this... ...is neither an attack, nor a declaration of war... It is me striking back at that which has created me. This young man is Satoshi from Masara Town. Yearning to become a Pokémon Master, he trains hard while journeying with his friends. I can smell the ocean! Nice view, too. How about we stop for lunch? All right! I'm so hungry... You sure stuffed yourself at the Pokémon Center this morning, though. That was then, and this is now!{Literally "Morning is morning, noon is noon!"} One can't battle on an empty stomach. Eating is part of training, too! Got that right! You're the man, Takeshi!{SASUGA -Starfish} You really have a way with words! Help us set out the dishes and cutlery, okay? Sure, I got this! I can't... Satoshi! We're not done yet! I'm so hungry I can't move a muscle... Sheesh! Kasumi. Gently simmer... Slowly nurture... Stew and Pokémon training alike can't be rushed. Hey! My homeboy! You're the homie from Masara Town named Satoshi who got all eight badges, am I right? Yeah. Why? Okay!{Holey sheets so I'm timing this without really watching it and only now on this new line did I actually see this guy and he went from pirate-ish to full-blown pirate, didn't he?} Wanna show me your stuff in a Pokémon battle? Okay! I can't say no to a good battle! What happened to not moving a muscle? I can make room for a Pokémon battle or two before breakfast!

We members of Team Rocket gotta get that Pikachu at all costs, meow! But get a load of that... Here, Togepi. Open wide! Like it? I'm starving, meow... I have a frying pan. It's a useless hunk of junk if you don't have meat or veggies to fry in it, meow. Satoshi from Masara Town... ...as well as his traveling companions: The Hanada Gym Leader, Kasumi and the Nibi Gym Leader, Takeshi. Master, shall I extend an invitation to them, as well? Understood. Who are you? What's that about?! Stop it! Typical Lizardon. But... Is this for me? Please pardon the sudden letter. She sure is a pretty lady! Having recognized you as promising Pokémon Trainers, my master, the mightiest Pokémon Trainer, has formally invited you to his party. It will be held in the Pokémon castle on New Island. Please check the appropriate box on the reply card indicating whether or not you will be present. We hope you will accept this invitation from the mightiest Pokémon Trainer. Pretty lady... What should we do? Let's go! We gotta do it! Feels pretty good to be called promising or whatever! So, you're gonna check the box on the reply card? Definitely! You're not going bye-bye without saying hi to us first, are you? What's this? Calm down, Ratta! Kingler, enough already! The weather was so nice, too! The weather by the sea is always fickle. What? The ferry's not coming? We can't go to New Island? We're lucky we were even invited! Quiet down, everyone! The woman standing next to me is in charge of this wharf. I'm Voyager. If you wish to know the sea, ask the Camome by the wharf.{WITCHCRAFT! There are no seagulls in this world. Only Wingull. -Starfish}{Well would you look at that, the remake fixed this SUPER MASSIVE PLOT HOLE. Not marking it as New Line Cinema however because the line is otherwise unchanged. -Starfish OF THE EVEN FURTHER FUTURE WORKING ON A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE MOVIE} Though you need not bother. Simply follow the path of the wind. I've never witnessed such a hurricane. It's that bad? I grew up by the port, yet I've never seen such a raging storm. Worse yet, the eye of the storm is offshore above the skies of New Island. I simply cannot subject you all to such peril. As the protector of this port, that is my wish. There you have it. The ferry is canceled. I'll be just fine with my Pokémon! It's good in the water. We'll cross the ocean, no problem! Please, wait. I know the ocean, and I'm telling you no. That's right! Besides, if your Pokémon were injured, you'd have no way of getting them treated at the Pokémon Center right now! What do you mean? Miss Joy from the Pokémon Center went missing a week ago. We can't treat any Pokémon's injuries without her. That missing person poster over there is for her.{"WANTED A MISSING PERSON". -Starfish}{IT NO LONGER SAYS WANTED A MISSING PERSON WORST MOVIE EVER. -Starfish OF THE WINTER HOLIDAYS 2019} She's pretty! Huh? She looks... familiar...{as opposed to every other identical Joy in Kanto? —Puto}{Takeshi can tell them apart, remember? -Starfish} Stop! Stop or you're under arrest! Sheesh! I suppose stopping them was futile. {Muda Muda! -Dio} What? They're Pokémon Trainers, after all... Adventurers. If they were the sort of people to quit after being told no, they wouldn't have gathered here. We can only pray for their safety. The mightiest trainer is waiting across the sea! I can't back down now! But there's no way we can cross the raging sea with our Pokémon. You're right... The smashing, crashing, stormy sea... {I took a lot of liberties here to make this flow well, so please consult me if any of this needs changing. I added the rhyming so it would be more sing-song. -J} ...is nothing for our group of three! Our lot were bathed in the crashing waves of the Guren Strait as newborns! {Shouldn't it be "was" in place of "were"? - Toa} You said it, meow! If one of us were ever in need, we'd come together so they'd succeed! The horizon in the distance... ...beckons us ashore! Wanna ride? Not saying it's gonna be free, but we could be convinced to give you a ride. Yeah! We'd appreciate it! Our ship has come in... Literally! Togepi, stay still just a bit longer. But will we really make it in a boat like this? Don't judge a book by its cover!{Literally "Don't judge by how it looks" -Starfish} A clever Pidgeot conceals its talons! Captain, we're good to go! Roger! And... push, meow! It's you guys!{Should probably slur the eff out of this subtitle to match how he's trying to speak while underwater... But this is what he's TRYING to say. -Starfish}{Nah, it's a simple enough line that I feel like it would just be distracting. I'm in favor of leaving it. -J} Team Rocket!{Ditto -Starfish} Team Rocket! We should have known better! What do you want? If you ask us "What do you want?", We'll answer out of{\fscx250}-{\r} Satoshi! Kasumi! Where are Satoshi and Pikachu? I can't tell! Thank you, Hitodeman. Zenigame, you really saved me! We're delighted you could make it. Please present your invitation. This message is to confirm that these people are among those invited. I knew it was you! What? The Miss Joy I saw at the port! They do kinda look alike. What do you mean? I've been in service of this castle since I was born. If you would, please come with me. Our other esteemed guests have already arrived. Phew... The trainers over there are the ones who arrived before you. Only three of them? When there were so many at the port? The invitations given to the trainers who could not brave the storm were wasted. Are you saying the storm was a test? Please release your Pokémon from their Monster Balls and take a seat. You are chosen trainers.{You are the Chosen Children. -Puto who watched too much Digimon} So, if we want to sneak our way into the castle... ...we'll just have to take the exit, won't we? What exit? Down there. The sewage pipes?! I'm not some stinking rat! Quit whining! It's the only way in, so deal with it! What's up? Nothing... Come on, let's go! Slide, slide... So you guys made it here, too? Did you all cross through the ocean? I flew here. My Pidgeot handles hurricanes like a champ. Guys, come say hi! I crossed the ocean on my Gyarados's back. You mean the Atrocious Pokémon, Gyarados? {Wow, jerk. Way to rub it in the Gyarados's face that it's not winning against Milotic at a beauty contest. - Toa} Yup. I came here with this little one, and with them as well. Beautiful... Kamex, Dewgong, Rafflesia, Kyukon, Gallop... And your Pukurin, too. But above all... You, their lovely trainer, are truly a queen of incomparable beauty! Miss, once this storm has passed, you and I will look upon the tranquil sea, enjoy my {"}specially{"} made rice balls, {I'm a little worried about what's in those "specially" made rice balls. - Toa} and discuss our{\fscx250}-{\r} All right, you. You can eat on your own. Esteemed guests, I apologize for the wait.{This movie DOES keep us waiting a lot, yes. SO much padding... -Starfish OF THE WINTER HOLIDAYS 2019} The mightiest Pokémon Trainer will be with you shortly. What's that? Nyarth! Oh, coming, meow! Indeed... The person before you is the mightiest Pokémon Trainer, as well as the mightiest Pokémon. Master Mewtwo. Mewtwo...? A Pokémon who's a Pokémon Trainer?! Yeah right! Is that wrong? This voice! It's telepathy! I set my own rules. If this is some kinda sick joke, I'm outta here! Go, Gyarados! Gyarados, use Destroyer Beam! Gyarados! Much too easy. I have no further need of you. Miss Joy, I knew it was you! Where am I? What am I doing here? I brought you here from the Pokémon Center so that you would care for me. Having a doctor who is familiar with the anatomy of Pokémon is convenient. You've proven your worth. Though you surely have no memory of it. What was that?! With my powers, I can easily control you humans however I see fit. That's horrible! What's this place? None of this looks like treasure, does it? What a cutie, meow! You call that cute? This was how our research began. This device was designed to create copies of Pokémon. Through this device, we have at last... ...successfully realized that goal. W-What?! Nyarth! Nyarth?! H-H-Hey, wait! Hey, Kojiro! Get him! Help me, meow! Grab on! M-My fur... My fur! Oh! Three strands of fur! Even a small sample will do... By studying the composition of the Pokémon in question... ...we should be able to create a copy of the original Pokémon. Who's this? Nyarth! Nyarth?! I'm Nyarth, meow! Then, is this...? A copy of Nyarth? Aww jeez... But the copy we created was no mere copy. Deep in the j... gle, we discovered a ruin built to worship Mew. There, we found a fossilized Mew eyelash. We created Mewtwo based on the composition of the fossil. To create the world's mightiest Pokémon... That was our dream. However... So this is... ...a Pokémon copy laboratory?! But... Why's nobody here, meow? Maybe they have the day off? Or they could be on vacation... I had once hoped to work with you humans. Yet your kind failed me. Humans are beneath even Pokémon. If weak, terrible beings like you humans control the planet... ...then we're all doomed. So what you're saying is that you want Pokémon to rule the planet? Pokémon cannot, either. Because this planet is already controlled by humans. There are even Pokémon who live for humans! What? You say you're not a slave? You stay with your trainer out of mutual affinity? That very act was a grave mistake. Pikachu! Weak Pokémon nestle up to humans. Satoshi, are you okay? Yeah. How dare you hurt Pikachu?! You may be strong, but there's no Pokémon that can't be caught! Go, my Saihorn! Saihorn! A vain attempt.{MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA -Dio} I was born stronger than any and all Pokémon living on this planet. You can't say that without fighting! Do you volunteer? What? What was that? What, meow? "Mew"? All humans who seek to become Pokémon Trainers wish to begin with... ...Fushigidane, Zenigame, or Hitokage. These are their evolved forms... ...and my copies. Copies? A battlefield? You mean you want to have a Pokémon battle? I have my Fushigibana, Bernard! And I have my Kamex, Exex! Me, too! Lizardon, I choose you! Lizardon, no surprise attacks! Your Lizardon is ill-mannered. Who will face us first? I let my guard down earlier, but that won't happen again! Go, Bernard! Use Razor Leaf! Vine Whip. Energy Ball! All right! Leaf Storm. Bernard! Are you okay?! I'm next! Go, Exex! Rocket Headbutt! Rocket Headbutt. Exex! Hydro Pump! Exex! Satoshi, be careful! Their moves are really powerful! I know! As long as none of them land, it doesn't matter! Let's go, Lizardon! We'll fight back with speed! How is that "fighting back with speed"? His opponent is too fast! Lizardon! Globe Throw. Lizardon! It seems to lack both speed and power. Exex! Bernard! Do you plan on stealing people's Pokémon?! "Steal"? No... I will create far superior copies of the Pokémon you're so proud of! Ones befitting of me! Copies?! Cut it out! That's against the rules! Don't give me orders! I make my own rules. Here they come! Run, everyone! Gyarados! Hey! I just gotta return them to their own Balls! How pointless.{MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA -Dio} Return, Zenigame, Fushigidane! Right! How is that...? Nothing is impossible for these Monster Balls I've created. Stay quiet! Oh, no! Koduck! Rokon! Run, Pikachu! Pikachu! Don't lose! Pikachu! Pikachu! Who's this? Strike!{No that is definitely an Alakazam!!!!1111 --Puto} Dewgong! Rafflesia! Sandpan! Nidoqueen! Showers! But this is definitely Nyarth, meow... Oww... Brat boy?! Team Rocket?! Sorry, but I don't have time for this today! Hang on! Hey! Who's this? Pikachu?! Come on...! Oh, my! Pikachu! So many copies! They're coming out... My copy, too! Those are all copies?! Oh, my! Here come the real ones, too! Zenigame! Fushigidane! Humans! I will not take your lives. You are free to leave. That is, if you're capable of braving the storm... What is happening? Unforgivable... I'll never forgive you! Satoshi! Satoshi! Koduck! Rokon! Did you free them? I'll protect my Pokémon... Protect my friends! Satoshi! Stop! What? What is that? A Pokémon? Mew! I've seen pictures of it in books... So have I. The phantom Pokémon... Mew... The mightiest Pokémon, Mew, said to be one of a kind! Mew? It really exists! Yes. Yet I am the mightiest Pokémon. It is true that I was created from you...{Technically this line has been changed to say "I was created from a piece of you", but I'm not sure that difference is even worth including. -Starfish OF DECEMBER 20TH} ...but I am the stronger one! I am the real one! Mew and Mewtwo... Mewtwo was created from Mew... Only I will survive! Why do you retreat? Do you avoid battle out of fear? It appears you can fight back, at least. It's time to determine who is real! Am I stronger than Mew? Are we stronger than you so-called originals? We were created to surpass you in strength! So that's it, meow. What's it saying? "The originals won't lose. "Real is real. "If they battle with physical strength alone rather than using their moves, "the real Pokémon will not lose to mere copies." "Real is real," you say? Very well. We can determine who is real without our moves! We are the stronger ones! Go! What kind of a battle is this? The real ones and their copies... They're all alive now! They're all living creatures. Even though they're artificial, they're still living, breathing creatures. Real ones and copies... But both living creatures... There's no winning or losing... If you ask us about this... I just don't know... This is really depressing... It's like they're bullying themselves... It's like looking at my past self... Like looking at my current self... What an awful feeling! You're...! These gotta hurt, meow... All the other Pokémon are fighting, so don't be such a scaredy-cat, meow! What? "You're the scaredy-cat", meow? "Why won't you fight me"?! "Those claws must hurt"? Your claws gotta hurt way more, meow! "I bet the moon will shine bright tonight"? Yeah... Must be a full moon, meow... Talking about the moon at a time like this... You're quite the philosopher, meow... Pikachu! Ow... That's enough! Stop! Satoshi! Satoshi! I have to make them stop... You can't. Unless Mew and Mewtwo stop, the fighting will continue. Living creatures never yield their territory to others of their kind. Oh, no... They'll fight until they've driven their foes away. That's what living creatures do. That's what living creatures do... But Mewtwo was created by humans. But now... It's just another creature. Now it's just another creature... Both Mew and Mewtwo... And Pikachu... And the other Pikachu, too... Please, just stop! Stop! Satoshi! Satoshi! Impossible! A human attempted to end our battle? Satoshi... Pikachu... Pikachu! It's true... ...that you and I are both Pokémon who already exist in this world. It may be best that no one know of this incident. Perhaps it is best left forgotten. Where are you all going? We have been born... We are alive. We will live on... ...somewhere... in this world. Please quiet down, everyone! We can't send out any ships in this storm! Never before have I witnessed a hurricane of such ferocity. Please, seek shelter. Man, what a letdown... There's no need to worry. We're opening the Pokémon Center to be used as a shelter. Anyone who wishes to use our services, please come with me. Miss Joy, Miss Junsa, Miss Voyager... All three of them look stunning today, drenched in rain... But what are we doing here? Not sure... We just are here, I guess... Well, whatever. Is this even possible? The hurricane... It's like it never happened... Yeah... I'd say the ships can set sail tomorrow. Yes. Is that...? What? I think it was... I don't see anything. Just a bunch of clouds. The day I set off to become a Pokémon Master, I saw a phantom Pokémon. And I think I just saw another. Maybe you'll get to meet another one! A phantom Pokémon. Yeah! I'm sure someday I will! Pocket Monsters... Pokémon for short. This is the tale of those aiming to become Pokémon Trainers, and their encounters with the strange creatures known as Pokémon. Their journey will go on and on.
