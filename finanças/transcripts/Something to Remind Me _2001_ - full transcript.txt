"As a final note let a man keep his object of desire. He regards it as his property, he projects a figure lying on their desires. And most importantly - he alone with her. No it does not distract, no one asks questions. A man becomes a child. My advice - pretend to be asleep, and let him dream. Do not disturb him. You still have time to show him your knowledge of life and love. But remember, this only works if you do not give in to his wishes, So stay collected. " Thomas? Yes? How often are you reading this?
