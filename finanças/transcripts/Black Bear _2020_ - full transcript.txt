- Hey. - I got it. That's all right. Shit. Oh... Hey. You're Allison? Yeah. You're Gabe? That bag has wheels. Ah, it's fine. It's light. So you're a film director? Mike told you that? Oh, you know Mike? No, Mike didn't say anything. Just the vibe I'm pickin' up. Oh, that's funny. What else did he tell you about me? No... No, nothin'. He said, uh, you used to be an actress and now you're a director. - Mmm. - I swear to... I swear to God. Why'd you give it up, acting? I didn't. I think people just sort of stopped hiring me, maybe. But I'm actually happier doing what I'm doing. At least now I can eat cookies sometimes. What was it, were you difficult? Man, you're nosy. Um, I don't know, maybe I, maybe I just wasn't attractive enough. Oh, yeah. Mike mentioned that you like to fish around for compliments. Well, that is not true. I do not like compliments. Well, I don't think that's why I stopped. You really don't need to prove anything to me. I... I prefer weak... sickly men. Is that what your husband's like? I don't have a husband. No? 'Cause Mike said that your husband was gonna be joining us. Yeah, I thought you told me everything he said about me. I don't have a husband. No one's joining me, Gabe. I'm all alone in this world. Okay? Happy? Any other questions? Well, a few. I bet. So, what kind of movies do you make? Um, unsuccessful, small ones that nobody likes. Hey. What are you doin'? Morning, honey. Doctor said second trimester you shouldn't be lifting heavy things. Well, it's Friday. - Right? You forgot last week. Can you...? - I'm looking out for you. - Hi. I'm Allison. - Oh, I know. I'm Blair. You're really pretty. No, I meant that as a compliment. No, I know. I know. I, uh... You are too. - You are! - No. No, it's... You don't have to do that. I was just telling him how much I hate compliments. Apparently, we have that in common. Well, I like compliments. I don't know why I'm spending all this money on doctors if we're not gonna take her advice. - "You"? - We're. Whatever. - I know what the doctor said. I was there. - I don't want you... I don't want to talk about this right now. - Gabe. - I'm looking out for you. Gabe, your wife wants to move on. Ah, no, we're not married. Where's your husband? I don't have a husband. Anyway, can I just get her set up? I was hoping to get into the studio sometime this week, or century. I like your overalls. They're really cute. I like your bag. I told you, I don't like compliments. I just feel like I asked you three or four times and you keep saying you're going to do it, but then you just don't do it. So, I just did it eventually because just didn't want to keep asking you to do it. I kept smelling garbage when making my coffee. I don't understand how you can drink your coffee and smell garbage over here. Because your sense of smell is way more sensitive right now. Absolutely. Hi. Hey. - You gonna go for a swim? - Yeah. Oh, let me show you down. Okay. I don't know how you do it this time of year. It's so cold. I know, I'm weird. I love the cold. So it's just up the stairs... Mm. Mm. This is really good, Gabe. Did you pick those? Mm-hm. Did you pick the ones in my room too? Yeah. You are a great host. Do you want some wine? Are you gonna have some? Yeah, I could have a little. Okay. So do you guys have a plan for this place? Are you gonna turn it into a B&B or...? No. Um, I don't really know what we're doing. We just sort of put the word out to our friends that were creative, or whatever, that we had this place, that it would make a great retreat or maybe even a place to do film shoots or... Yeah, we could meet some cool people and maybe make a little money. Yeah. It wasn't really about the money. This place has been in Gabe's family for a really long time. - Yeah. We... - Oh. That's cool. We used to have these, um, huge family reunion type thing... Now everybody hates each other though, so... Heh. No, not everybody. It's just, the family's not as close as they used to be. - Mm. - Point is, no one's ever here anymore. When Blair got pregnant, we just kind of decided... Mm, we didn't really decide exactly. We were... we were living in Brooklyn and it was getting so expensive, and we weren't really working, so... Ah. Yeah. No. - Well, what? - Nah. The idea of moving out here appealed to us, yeah, but I don't think we would've left if we had jobs. We had jobs. We had jobs. Heh. - Yeah, I mean... - You... I was a dancer. Well, I wanted to be, but I wasn't really making any money. And I was hostessing, but Gabe really thought that I... Yeah, I just didn't want her being on her feet all the time, and... late hours and not... never sleeping, and this place was just sitting here empty, so... He's mom's been trying to sell it for years. Well, no, it hasn't been years. It's been a year and a half. Two years. She's been selling it, trying to sell it, for two years. She's... She's not the most realistic person. It's not that, it's just that she doesn't need to sell it. Okay. She's not gonna get what she's asking for it anyway, so... And she was paying this caretaker... What about you? What was your job? Gabe was a musician. I... Well, I am a musician. It's not so... It's not something you stop being. I just meant professionally. I'm still a professional. I still get royalties. The last royalty he got was for 53 cents. It's what I do for my life. I'm a professional musician. Hm. I used to play in different bands. Real, successful bands. I would be on the road, depending on the year, six, eight months. Wow, that must've been hard for you. Mm, I don't know. I'm a pretty independent person. Heh, she hated it. I didn't hate it. I... I didn't hate it. There were a variety of reasons we moved up here, none of which was to start a B&B. You're so lucky. What do you mean? You've got a guy who cooks. I can't cook. Like, at all. Like, anything? Can you cook eggs? I can scramble an egg. Maybe. What about a hamburger? Have you ever cooked a hamburger? Baked a potato? Uh-uh. You never baked a potato? It's not something I'm proud of. You know, I couldn't cook either till a couple months ago. So your mom never taught you how to cook anything? My mother's dead. Sorry, I know that that's like a standard joke that people make, but in my case, it's true. She's dead. She actually died right in front of me. That's... My whole family, in a restaurant. She had a stroke. God, I'm sorry. Oh, my God, no, it's okay. It's fine. And that's actually not why I don't know how to cook. My dad is an excellent cook. Yeah, it was totally intentional. I figured if, um, I never learned how to cook, then I would never become a housewife. It's smart. You think that's smart? It's not that I don't think that that's smart, it's just, I'm so surprised to hear him say that, because he's really into traditional gender roles. You are. Come on. You're always talking about how fucked up feminism is. Uh, what?! No. That's a... Okay, so now that you're in front of a real feminist, - you're gonna pretend... - You're... She's oversimplifying. - A lot. - Hey, I think feminism is fucked up. Yeah. Hairy armpits on women, disgusting. On men... I'm kidding. Were you kidding about your mom? No. You're really hard to read. Yeah, you know what, I get that all the time, but I actually think that I'm so easy to read that people just get confused and they make it harder on themselves. You're just different than I what I thought you would be like from watching your films. You've seen my movies? Yeah, we watched them before you came. Really? Well, I'm so sorry. Ah, you don't have to be sorry. I... I loved them. Thank you. A little more wine? Are you gonna have more? Um, okay. Sure. I'll have some more. What? The doctor said I could have a few glasses of wine every now and then. She didn't say a few, she said a couple. Okay, this is my second. This will be your third that I know of. And "once in a while" isn't every night. I had one glass of wine on Wednesday. Yeah, that was two days ago. Okay, here. You happy? I just want you to remember this night when the baby comes out all fucked up. Hey, do you know the foxtrot? You said you were a dancer, right? Okay, so... Okay. - I guess I'll be the guy. Um... - Okay. You put your hand on my collarbone like that. And I'm gonna get my hand here like this. Okay. And... you're gonna lead with your right foot, so you take two steps and then a step to the side. Okay. Two steps. So, right, left. Side step. - Right. - Right again. - Left. - Side. Yes. You have... Then you go back with your left foot. - Left. Right. - Right. Side step. But make your steps small because it's foxtrot. - Sorry, I'm not... - No, it's fine. - Left. Left. - Sorry. Left. Right. Step. There you go, right. Right. But you can step forward, you're not gonna step on me. - Okay, sorry. - You're just stepping forward and back. And... - I don't have good... - Right. I don't have the fundamentals. Right. Left. Step. Step. Right. Left. - Side step. - You have really good posture. Forward. Well, yeah, I danced my whole life. And then back and... Right. Side step. You got it. That's it. Oh, okay. Heh. I'm pretty sure I don't got it. Why don't you dance with Gabe? He knows it. Gabe, dance with Allison. You're offending her. No, you don't have to. One, two. - Well... Well... - Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. If I can't get drunk, at least let me enjoy watching you. You know, there's something I've been really wanting to ask you. Hm? Do you find it weird, acting in your own films? Or... do you, like, I don't know, get off watching yourself or something? Oh. No. Um... No. I actually find it kind of humiliating. Oh. And this, um, film that you're writing, are you gonna act in that? I'm not exactly writing yet. Really? 'Cause you said earlier that you were... Blair. What? I'm sorry, it's just so rare to have the opportunity to pick a real artist's brain. So, were you thinking of setting it here? Or did you just come here to write? Um, I mean, when I saw the pictures online, it was, it was so beautiful, I just thought coming here might inspire me. But, honestly, I don't know if I'm gonna make another movie. This has happened to you before, right? Writer's block? Yeah, pretty much every time. So this is just your process. Well, I wouldn't really call it a process. It's more like I'm just kind of doing something stupid with my day. Waiting for something meaningful to happen to me, heh. But you, you're doing something meaningful. Me? What am I doing? You're building a family. I'm confused. Didn't you just say that you didn't learn how to cook because you didn't want to become a housewife? Lot's of women have families that aren't housewives. What you said before, by the way, is bullshit. That, that I'm into traditional gender roles. I think I'm into traditional gender roles. Yeah. No, I really, I mean that. I don't know, I can't say a part of me doesn't want a man to just... come along and take care of everything. Doesn't that kind of contradict your entire life? What about your films? Don't you think they're feminist? I don't think about them one way or the other. You don't think about them? How can you make something if you never think about it? Sometimes, when you're, you know, making something, you're not conscious... I'm talking to her. Yeah. No, no, no. I think about it, but I don't, it's not like I have any really big ideas or anything, when I'm making something. How can you make something if you don't have anything to say? I have something to say. I just think the movie is the only way to say it. Just seems a little solipsistic to me. Oh, I don't know what that means. What does that mean? That word? Self-involved. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Blair likes everything tied up in nice little bows. Heh. No, I... I think I get it. Right. Heh. Just, like, how you get that, just because I say something about how abandoning traditional gender roles has destabilized society doesn't mean I'm a male chauvinist. Nobody said you were a male chauvinist. 'Cause, you know, it's like, for hundreds and hundreds of years, the nuclear family meant everything to people, right. Everybody had their defined role. Now, that's broken down. There's no real sense of, uh, of family, - or community anymore. - Communities that viewed women as private property. Well, yeah, and from our modern perspective, that may seem terrible. No, it's objectively terrible. Objectively? I'm 6'1", that's an objective fact. Are you following this? Heh. Okay, how can we know women weren't happier prior to the industrial revolution? They definitely were not! Fine! All I'm saying is that the erosion of traditional communities is part of why things are so chaotic right now, and... Oh, that's why everything's so chaotic. Look, I'm not say... I'm not saying that feminism is bad. All I'm saying is that all these things have disappeared... you know, religious beliefs, for example. You know, delusional or not, their disappearance has created an absence in the meaning of our lives. That's why all these things that you don't like... uh, nationalism, fundamentalism, white supremacy is on the rise. Right? Globalism, feminism, - those things are... - What's your point, Gabe?! I'm-I'm-I'm saying that nature is just gonna fucking do what it do, you know, and the fucking earth is gonna be consumed - by the sun... - Fuck! ...and all this shit like ideology, religion, consumerism, you know, it's all just a bunch of bullshit that people created to distract ourselves from the idea that we live in a fucking horrible shithole. - Yes. - It's a big shithole, meaningless fuckhole. How is it helpful to think that way, Gabe? I'm not trying to be helpful, Blair. I'm just trying to tell you the way it is. It's like she can't stand the fact that I have a single thought about this world. No, it's not that I can't stand that you have thoughts about the world. It's that I can't stand the thoughts about the world that you have. This has been so fun, but... - Where are you going? - I'm really tired. You've alienated our guest. No, no, no, no, it's okay. - Please, I'm so sorry. - No, no, it's fine. It's fine. Thank you so much for dinner. This conversation was actually very fascinating. - Why don't you just... - I wish I was recording that. That was... Yes. Can you just stay? - I'm... I'm gonna go. - Please, don't go. - It's fine. Please. - Please? We can change the subject. No, Blair, I don't want to change the subject. - Blair. Blair. - Change the subject. - I don't want to... I don't want to change the subject. - We'll change the subject. I want you to get it through your thick fucking skull that there is difference between saying the upheaval in traditional gender roles hasn't been great for society and me being a male chauvinist. No, you just want to go back in time to when women spent their entire adult lives pregnant and never left the house, so we could protect your precious male insecurity. You think women should be slaves. That's what you think. You think women should be fucking slaves. I-I mean, I do. You know, bitches be crazy. Shit. You know, fuck this. No, no, no, no. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That was stupid. I don't know why I said that. I know why you said it. You said it because you're uncomfortable with emotion. Anytime something real comes up, you have to make a joke. Okay, yeah, you're right. No, she's right, that-that is something I do. Yeah, but I wasn't joking, actually. Yeah, I said I was joking because it came out weird and I got embarrassed, but I think actually what I meant is, um, not that I think all women should be slaves, but that maybe I should be a slave. Like, maybe I'd be better off being a slave. Or a prisoner, you know. Or-or-or maybe I should just get knocked up and have a bunch of babies, because maybe that would give me some direction in my life, because I'm fucking crazy, and I don't know what to do with myself. Um, I don't know. That's insane. And it's deeply offensive. Okay. Are you joking right now? - Is this a joke? - I... I don't know. I'm s... I'm so high. I'm so stoned right now. Please, tell her. I just... I need... I want to go to bed. Blair, can you just calm... Can you calm down a little bit? Me? You're the one who had a shit fit. Hey. You're right. I am very, very, very sorry. It was totally insensitive. It was a dumb, callous, ignorant thing to say, okay. - I'm gonna go to bed... - I'm gonna go to bed! I'm the one who's going to bed! I'm going to bed. You stay up. Have your weird fucking anti-progressive conversation in peace. Good night. Um... - help yourself to anything you like. - Yeah. - I'm really sorry. - And, uh... Yeah. Oh, my God. Blair, really? What are you doing? You don't love me anymore. And I'm fucking pregnant with your fucking baby! Are we really doing this right now? I saw the way that you were looking at her! You think she's more interesting than me because she agrees with all your dumb, horrible ideas! Blair, I think that you've had a little bit too much to drink, okay, and your body is... - You're in love with her. You are, I know it. - ...and I've been drinking too. Ah... Who? Who? Allison? I-I-I'm not even sure if I like her. If you think you're in love with her, can you just tell me so I don't feel like I'm going fucking crazy?! Blair, do you hear the words that you are saying right now? You love her! You love her! - And she is bad. - Shh! - Oh yeah, she is fucking bad! - Shh! Why? What did...? - What did she do? I'm... - Are you defending her? I can't believe you're defending her. Baby, I barely know the girl. I don't... You attracted to her? - I... - Huh? - I knew it! I knew it! - Oh, my God! - I knew it. - I'm... I'm not attracted to her. Yeah, well, why didn't you just say that then? Because... she's attractive, so I thought that you wouldn't believe me if I said that she wasn't. You know what...? No, no, I don't care. I don't care. You... Just go and fuck her. - Go and fuck her. - Hey... - If that's what you want to do, I don't care. - Just calm... - You just go and fuck her! - ...down. - I bet her pussy smells like fucking spider shit! - Calm... down. Shh! What are you saying? This isn't about me, you know that? I said I was very clear that this is about the fact that you don't love me anymore. Stop. I love you. I-I wouldn't... I wouldn't be here if I, if I didn't love... Oh, my God, I wouldn't have done this if I didn't love you. I wouldn't... I wouldn't have been through all these moments like this all the time if I didn't love you. Hey. I love you. Blair. So, so, so much. Please. Can we stop now? This is insane. This is brutally insane. It's over. Maybe women were happier in the 1700s. What do I know? No. No, they definitely weren't. I'm sorry, I was being such a fuckin' dickhead. Yeah. Oh, my God. Hey. Brought this. It's a little chilly, so... Okay. Good night. It's warm. Yee! Heh. Oh! So, are you guys Buddhist? Oh. No, the sculptor who stayed here makes them. Hm. Allison, I'm sorry about before. We're kind of in our own little world up here, and... yeah, anyway. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Heh. Okay. Why'd you lie to me about seeing my movies? Why'd you lie to me about your husband? I've been lying since the second I got here. My mother's fine. Well, she's a bitch, but she's alive. She's in Wisconsin. What...? I'm a really good cook. Um, I just have zero interest in having a family. I think children are disgusting. And as for my scripts, I usually start with like a really simple premise, like... "Good triumphs over evil", and, um... I stopped getting hired as an actor because I was difficult. Obviously. - Yeah. - And... what else? I know exactly what solipsistic means. Um, I went to Wesleyan on a scholarship. I'm a total feminist. I am. I think women are totally superior and all men should die. So... Why didn't your husband come with you? I don't know. I'm glad he didn't. Oh, fuck. Mm. I'm not in love with her, okay? It was an accident, the... the baby, and... we're not right for each other. I mean, she thinks she loves me, but she actually hates me. I know this is a human being coming into the world, and I don't know... ...what's gonna happen, what's gonna happen to me, or... You think I'm a terrible person? No. - I am. - Mm. Don't say that. - I am. - No, you're not. Oh, fuck. Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! You fucking asshole! I fucking knew it! You said you... You fucking homewrecker! Get the fuck out of my house, you bitch! You bitch, get the fuck out of here! I can't believe you did this! Get back, you fucking liar! - Just listen to me... Stop! - You still fucked up! Blair! Stop! Ow! Ow! What? What? - Tell me. - Oh, my God. - What? What-what? What? What? - Oh, my God... What? Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. - Ah! Oh, my God! - Oh, shit. Hey. Hey, she's bleeding! Go get the keys! - Oh, my God! - Okay, babe, we're gonna go to the hospital. Okay? Go get the keys to the truck! By the front door! She's bleeding! Look at me, we're gonna go to the hospital, okay. I'm so sorry. - Don't fucking touch me! - What are you doing?! Get the car! Go get the car! - It hurts. - Okay... Okay... I'm scared... I'm scared. Just breathe. Drive! Oh, my God. I love you so much. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sorry, all right? I did it for whatever. I'm so sorry. Don't look at me! Oh! What's going on? They cut? I don't know. Gotta go again. Back to one. Hey! Was that bad? What did I do wrong? On the spot. Everything was great. Okay... So why are we going again if it was great? What do you want me to say? It was amazing, okay. It was... That was the best silent walk to the cabin I've ever seen. Really. Okay, if it was amazing, then why don't we call for dinner and get to the next scene earlier so we have more time? It's more important. Can you...? I'm coming to you. Can I get off? Can I go? What the fuck is going on? Nothing is going on. I don't understand what's going on with you. I've been doing, like, 15 takes every time, every scene and you're only asking Blair to do three. - Are you counting takes? - I don't have to count takes. I'm in the scenes. We're losing light, you know that? And we're losing time. We are. Why are you crying? Why? I'm... I'm sorry. I do less takes with Blair, because when I tell her to do something, she actually does it. Yeah? Is that good enough for you? I just wanted to do one more. So do the take, don't do the take. I really... I don't... I don't give a shit. Okay, 'cause it's your fucking face that's gonna be on camera! Yeah? You good to go? All right, everybody, last looks. - You okay? - Mm-hm. Are you sure? Want a tissue, Allison? Water? I'm okay. You look beautiful. Resetting to first position. Picture's up! I'm sorry, y'all, the tilapia, the tilapia we had for lunch did not agree with me. Okay. Roll sound! Sound speed! Marker. Oh, my God. You need to watch this take 'cause it's gonna be incredible. Look. Oh, my God. Is that a tear? Yeah. Now I'm wondering what kind of mind games you're playing with me. No, I don't have to. Okay, so I think we should stay in here, right, for like another 15, 20 minutes, let her start eating, notice we're the only ones not there, and then you should go in like two minutes before me, that way it looks like we were together and then deliberately spaced out our entrances to give the impression we weren't together. - Right? That's amazing. - I can't. What? Act like you're in love with me? No, I can act like I'm in love with you. - Right, and why, because you're a professional? - No, because you're adorable. You are, you're adorable in a neurotic, petulant sort of way. Okay, I don't like compliments. - Can we just get back to the plan? - I can't. I can't. What? It's what you do for a living. You don't think she knows what I'm up to? She knows it's helping her. Trust me, we've been married for six years. I know, it's just, I'm getting this vibe from her that feels really real, like she's actually gonna kill me. And don't you see how good that is for the last scene? It's fine. Oh, God, actually, you should go in like five minutes before me. We need to make it look like we were fucking and now we're trying to hide it. - But we're doing a bad job. - Exactly. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - What? Shut up. Stop. Okay, so will you go in first or am I going in first, or...? - Uh, I'll go in first. - Okay. No, you go in first, that way, if she tries to kill me - you'll protect me. - She's not gonna try to kill you. - Fine, I'll go in first. - Okay, you go in first. I'll come in, what, a couple minutes after you? Then... Oh! yeah, you should just sit somewhere where there's an empty seat next to you or across from you. I'm gonna come in, I'll sit by you, whatever I say, just giggle or smile or whatever. You... you think we should sit near each other? - Yeah. - I think we should sit as far away from each other as possible, but we keep looking at each other from afar. Oh, yes! Like these quick little glances? Like we're trying not to look at each other, but we can't help it. Oh, and we can also like play with our food and not eat it 'cause we, you know, we have no appetite, 'cause we're nervous, we're in love, and you know. I don't know, I'm actually kinda hungry. Me too. Uh, skip that part. Oh, my God, this scene's gonna be so good tonight. Oh, shit, she's gonna see us looking. Maybe we should mess up each other's hair. You're a genius. That's too much. - That's good. - Okay. Sorry. Uh... - There you go. - Oh, thanks. Okay, uh, what do you call a bear with no teeth? - Gummy Bear. - Gummy Bear. - What...? How did...? - How did you...? How do you know all these...? Don't ruin the surprise of the whole thing. You just read the same book as me. It doesn't mean that you... Okay, um, uh, what is a bear cub's favorite porno mag? - Barely Legal. - Barely Legal. That's... - Barely Legal, baby. - That was off the page. So, why was the little bear so spoiled? Baako, have you seen this bear? - What? - Bear. The jokes are pretty easy to memorize. It's like a mutual respect for everything. The, uh, last take was really good. You're amazing. - Don't really want any in here. - Oh, yeah? Is it too much? - It just gets a little build up, you know? - Totally. I think it looks great though. I mean, do you like it? - Mm-hm. - I'm glad we switched to this new foundation. I'm sorry we found it on the last day. - But you happy? - Yeah, I feel good. - Okay. Get your coffee. - Yeah, thank you. All right, let's get dressed. Mm-hm. Oh! Shit! Oh, my God, the coffee on this show is so fucking hot. I'm sorry, but that is the most attractive man on set, hands down. - Right? - Right. What? No. Baako! What? Listen, uh, we're splitting hairs here, 'cause they both sit on my face. Yes, we should do it in this order. Third and the first... I think you need to focus on Mike, because he's focusing on you. - I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know? Wait a minute, you're telling me you got a thing going on with Baako? I'm not saying I have a thing going on with him, I'm just saying, I don't know. Anyway, I think Mike might be more into you. No, that's not happening, he's straight. I don't think he's straight. Yes, he is. His face is. I think he's gay. Okay, thank you for telling the gay person who's gay to them. Makeup's ready if anyone has eyes on Allison. All right, so... It's over here, hon. Okay, so... What is he going with?

Yeah, we're gonna finish the film. Um, okay, so can you sit up for me for a second? - Okay. - Okay. That was... That was... Can you...? Is...? Can you stand up for me now? You're so pretty. You should be in the movie. You should be in the movie, not me. I'm tired. Okay, let's, let's stand up now. - I'm tired. I'm tired. - Okay. No, no, no, just... We're just gonna get dressed now. - You should be in the movie. God, I'm tired, I'm tired. - No, I'm not an actress. No, no, no, no. Okay. Um, okay. Can...

So you're just gonna go and we're gonna shoot this last scene. He's punishing me. You understand what I'm saying to you? Cahya, he's punishing me. First A.D. coming to set. Did you hear that? Do you think it was a bear? What bear? There's a bear? How come nobody tells me anything. Okay, Allison, start walking a little faster now. - Jesus Christ. - Are you okay? No, I'm not okay, obviously. And that shit was not mellow. Simone. The vape. Or whatever. You're stoned too? Why the fuck you smokin' with that bitch anyway? I'm not jealous. I'm just saying, that shit was not mellow. - You thought it was mellow? - No. I'm totally freaking out. I'm totally stoned. Where are you going?! Okay. All right, let's go. Let's go. Really, let's... Oh, yeah. No, I like that. We should probably light it. Um, hey, Baako... we have to go handheld. Just do it. Let's get rid of this track. I have the ability to be an actor. I just choose not to because I care about my craft. - No test, bitch. - Hey. Ooh. Hey, bud. Help me. Okay. Stop! Oh! Ho-ho! Heh. You got me. All right, let's have a seat, huh? The shit was not mellow, and now I'm just fucking stoned, and I have diarrhea. You asked for it. Yeah, well, you should have fucking said that it's not fucking mellow. I wouldn't describe it as that. - Cahya? - Yes, sir? - What's going on? - It's nothing. I, um, just have explosive diarrhea. - Oh. - And I think it was the tilapia we had for lunch. There was something a little off with it. Okay. I had tilapia, I'm fine. - You should get some Pepto. - Somebody got Pepto? I don't know, Simone gave me some the other day. Hey, what's the ETA on Allison? Cahya for Maude. ETA on Allison? What's left? Whoo-hoo... Oh. Oh. You had Pepto all this time? Hey, thanks for joining us. So, your first position's here on this chair. Do you want to give that to Maude? - Allison... - Hey, did you find that pepperoni? Allison... Can I talk to you outside? Outside. Let's go outside. Do I need to remind you that all of our money is wrapped up in this movie? Now, I do not know what you think you are doing, okay, but whatever is going on between me and you, we can talk about it tomorrow, because if we do not get through this scene tonight... Look at me... I promise you, you are going to regret it. Do you understand? Okay. Um, okay, guys. So, um, so we're just gonna take it through, "So there is something to talk about." Okay, and then, we're just gonna do a quick reset. Mike will step between you, and Blair, you'll just make your exit. And that's it, and we're done, and we're out of that. Okay? Allison? Allison? I heard you. Okay, great. We good to go? Yes, sir. Great. Okay... Where's my monitor? Okay, are we good? Why is this...? Okay. You ready? Roll sound. Wait, who's coverage is this? There's no coverage. It's... It's roaming. It's documentary style. What about the dolly shot? Well, we don't have time to do it now. So I'd appreciate it if you stop asking questions, and just please play the scene. Okay, call it. Roll sound. Sound speed. Scene 87 Romeo. Take 1. Mark. Camera set. Baako, tilt down just a little bit. Yeah. Okay, whenever you're ready. What, is it me? Oh, my God. Yeah, it... - It's my line? - What's the line? Nora? - Oh, my God. - Um... What's... What's the line, Nora? Nora, please. "What's it about, your dissertation?" That's my line? No wonder I didn't remember it. Um, I'm not saying that. Uh... What, you're gonna start the scene with a question? You should start it with her answering the question so the audience can figure out what we're talking about. That's a better way to do it. I mean, she's got a point with that. - Okay, hold on. Okay. - Thank you. No. Guys, if... You know, if we had gotten a rehearsal like, like I had asked for, then we can talk about lines, but we do not have time for a script conference right now. I'm not saying the fucking line! Um... Um, Blair, do you mind? Can we just start with your line? Why are you asking her? It's my line. - Blair? - Whatever you want. Okay. Thank you. "Whatever you want." Are we ready? Are we still good? All right. Roll sound. Sound speed. Take 2. Mark. Camera set. Blair, whenever you're ready. I would rather talk about anything else actually. What about you? What do you do? No, don't... Don't do that. Don't try to slither out of it, you slippery little snake. What? I'm interested. I am. I can't remember the last time that we had a PhD over for dinner. Oh, I'm not a PhD yet. She... She doesn't want to talk about it, so... Okay, okay, don't all gang up on me. Sweetie, might... Can you...? It's my second drink. Relax. Plus, if no one's gonna talk, I might as well get drunk, right? I didn't mean to give you that impression. I didn't think you would think it was interesting. Well, honey, if she thinks we're too stupid to understand her highfalutin dissertation... Quite the opposite, actually. You both strike me as highly intelligent. Uh, "quite the opposite, actually," is what she said. Okay, you're embarrassing yourself. You know what, we all got to blow off some steam sometimes, right? Heh, I don't need to blow off steam. And I don't need you to make excuses for my behavior. Don't... Don't point. You're alienating our guest. No, she's right. I'm sorry, it's about the moral complications that are being engendered by the cybernetic revolution. My dissertation. Line? What's the line? What? No, I know my... I know my line. - Okay. - Okay, fuck it. - Can we cut? - No, keep rolling. - I need to cut. - Okay, fine, cut. Cut. That's good. That was good. Yeah? - Okay. - Okay. That was good. Fuck. Okay. Um... That was great. That was amazing. - Oh, can I give you, like, a fun note? - Yeah. Um... - Yeah, that's good. - That's good. - Okay. - Okay, um... Allison, can I talk to you for a minute? - Can I talk to you? - Mm. - Did you see that? - Yes. What the fuck? I guess the thing is, um, I don't understand why I say my next line. It... It's about the mark on his neck. - Yeah, I know what it's about. - Okay... I don't know, I don't know what I'm doing with it. You're marking your territory. Okay. So when I try to take care of you, you think that that's what I'm doing? - What? - Jesus Christ, you think I'm a fuckin' bitch. - Allison... - You do. Even when I'm trying to take care of you... - Allison... - ...you read the worst into it. Have you read the script at all? 'Cause, to me, it seems like you have, because you're wasted and you still remember every single one of your lines. You could've asked me any questions in the last six months, but you're deciding to do it now, on the last day of shooting, when we have two hours to shoot the most important scene of the film, because you decide to get drunk and show up late to set. Okay, not everything is about you! Okay, it's a fucking line in a movie. - Just say it! - No, it's not! Bullshit! You're fucking full of shit! All right, um, okay, everybody, um... Oh, you are killing me with these looks. Every single take, she looks exactly the same. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be an asshole. I'm just under a lot of stress right now. Uh... Okay, thanks. Sorry, I'm just... Um... Duh-duh. - Where are we...? Where are we...? - What's the line, Nora? - What's the line that we just started on? - Um... Uh... Uh... "Rachel, cut it out." - "Rachel, cut it out." We'll got from there. - That's not a line in the scene. Oh, fuck. What's the line that we just left off on, Nora? Oh, my God. NORA What's the line that we just started with, - just now, just on the last scene? - Uh... The same exact line we just did? Um... - Holy God. - I... I'm so... I'm so sorry. God, does anybody know, what's...? "Rachel, you're alienating our guest." Fine. Okay. Let's go from there. "Rachel... alienate our guest." Oh, my God. All right. Let's go. Yeah. You're doin' great, guys. Everyone, honestly. Blair, it's really beautiful work, uh, everyone. Thanks so much. Are we good? - Yeah. - Jesus. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Good. All right, um, call it. Um, roll sound. Ahem. Sound speed. Take three. Mark. Camera set. Allison... Okay. Action. Rachel, you're alienating our guest. No, uh, she's right. It's about the moral complications that are being engendered by the cybernetic revolution. My dissertation. That thing is still on your neck. It's nothing. It's... You need to get it checked out. Okay. - What? It could be malignant. - It's not malignant, okay. It's not fucking malignant. What were you saying? The-the moral implication that you were... It's about how morality's changing. - Yeah, no, I get it, but, uh... - You're wasting your time, she thinks we're dumb. All right, all right, that's it. Rachel, you're wasted. That's enough. He can't take care of himself, okay. For years, he complains of his stomach ache, I told him to go to the fucking doctor. - Can I get this? - He wouldn't go. I hassle him for months, he doesn't go... - Stop. - He finally goes, and guess what? - It's a fuckin' ulcer. - Rachel, shut up, okay? - He's a baby. - Shut up! Shut the fuck up! - I-I'm sorry, that's not, that's not how we like normally... - Why are you talking to her? She doesn't care about you. Okay, she doesn't care about what happens to you. I care! I'm your wife! She's trying to steal you away from me. - That's fucking insane! - Don't fucking do that. Don't make me feel crazy, please! I am not stupid! I'm not! I see how you guys look at each other! It's so fucking obvious! Just please, please, please just be honest with me. Just tell me the fucking truth. I'm gonna go. No. No, no, you don't have to do that. Rachel, just step aside and let her go, and then we can just talk about this. So there is something to talk about. - There is nothing going on! - Okay... - Must be. - Give me the fucking glass. There's nothing going on! He's my husband, okay! - Do you understand, bitch?! Get your own fucking husband! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jack, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh, fuck! - Get your own fucking husband! Uh... cut! Alli! Cut! Cut! Cut! Alli! Alli, cut! Cut! Cut!

I'm on it. - Was it good? - Yeah, it was great. - It was really good. - Can you use it? Yeah, we'll just, um, we'll change the blocking for the last shot, it'll be great. Okay. I need to...
