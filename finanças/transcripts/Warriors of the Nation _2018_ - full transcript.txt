The ceremony's starting! Welcome, altar master! With Qiankun fire underfoot, and an immortal body, the bone is like sky, and skin like the earth. With Maoshan School's master as protection, Abracadabra... White Lotus altar master, with magic powers to protect the body, against spear thrusts and sword cuts, and the damage of water and fire. Against spear thrusts and sword cuts, and the damage of water and fire. White Lotus Society altar master Mao Shankai from Guangzhou welcomes the Holy Mother! With the holy white lotus, Holy Mother arrives! Recover the Ming Dynasty! Unify the whole country! Holy Mother of White Lotus! Today, we must capture this corrupt government official to offer as sacrifice to Ming's King. Catch the government official, and sacrifice to King Ming. Overthrow Japanese imperialism! Abolish the Treaty of Shimonoseki! Big brother, these foreign invaders are so arrogant. They claim to defeat us on our turf. After we buy this medicine, let's go challenge them, too. Don't let Master hear you. Otherwise, - he'll blame you for asking for trouble. - It's all right. Shaojun. It's just an ordinary compass. You've been fiddling with it all this way. Su, you don't understand. It's our master's Valentine's Day present. Master, it's so fashionable of you to celebrate Valentine's Day. It's not what you think. I got it at the cost of my jade pendant. Shaojun. Stop the public displays of affection, or I'll get off. Overthrow Japanese imperialism! Abolish the Treaty of Shimonoseki! Abolish the Treaty of Shimonoseki! Punish traitors severely! The country is in crisis. When can we live a peaceful life? Master, I'll go and check it out. Okay. Behave yourself! I will! Master, this is my turf. I will go, too. Overthrow Japanese imperialism! Kuan is always careless and in a rush. Punish traitors severely! Abolish the Treaty of Shimonoseki! As imperial commissioner, you must be exhausted traveling all the way to Guangzhou. I'd like to propose a toast, celebrating Zhang's arrival. Thank you! Thanks for your hospitality! The government is afraid of war. I was sent to Guangdong to act as the occasion demands. Now, with a severe lack of military funds, I earnestly hope all rich merchants present in Guangdong can be generous enough to make donations for military spending. Our country faces a crisis. It's the best time for us to repay our country. Since you're asking, both financial and personnel support is no problem. White Lotus descends to the world; all commoners are liberated. This gang of heretics spreads lies to deceive people. It's absolutely lawless! White Lotus descends to the world; all commoners are liberated. Overthrow Japanese imperialism! Overthrow imperialism! Recover the Chinese nation! Overthrow imperialism! White Lotus Society! Get out of the way! Overthrow imperialism! Overthrow Japanese imperialism! Hey, you... Rong, come with me! Yes, Master! If we want to stay safe, we better get out of here now. Your Excellency, please! Capture corrupt officials and kill them all! - Kill them all! - Everyone, watch out! White Lotus descends to the world; all commoners are liberated. White Lotus removes all evil. All earthly events are related. Rise up! Corrupt officials! White Lotus Society is coming to catch you! Come and confess your sins. Thanks for your jade pendant. Who are you? You dare stop me from catching corrupt officials! Huang Feihong from Foshan. Huang Feihong. In broad daylight, how dare you kill government officials! You're completely lawless! I'm just carrying out justice on heaven's behalf! Dad! These people are with the White Lotus Society. They are doomed to fail. Dad! Dad! Su. - Dad. Who is he? His Kung Fu is so good! He's a friend of mine. One of the "ten tigers‚Äù of Guangdong, son of Huang Qiying. Huang Feihong. Dad! Don't move! Dad! Forward! Don't move! He has a gun. Kill him! You... don't... This bucktooth should miss it, standing so close. Kill him! Huang Feihong, your Kung Fu indeed fits your reputation. How about joining White Lotus Society? With the King of Ming's protection, you could live forever. You're just bluffing and being dishonest. It's obviously a heresy. You're just an ordinary person with no roots of wisdom. You deserve to be called Master with such excellent Kung Fu. Holy Mother. The skylight hasn't arrived. The timing isn't right. Just let the corrupt officials go today! - Let's go! - Yes! I will cherish your jade pendant. Huang! Shangguan! Thanks for your help today! You're welcome! Huang. Let me introduce you to Zhang Zhidong. All right. Huang, please. Please! Huang! Shangguan! Please! It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Excellency! You must be the master of that southern martial arts school, Huang Feihong. You've saved my life. I, Zhang Zhidong will never forget this. You're welcome. I can't afford such a compliment. Huang, Have a seat, please! Okay. Serve the tea! Huang. I have a student named Liu Yongfu. He lends his expertise from the Black Flag Army to your efforts and training as martial arts coach. Thanks for the appreciation. Huang, the war of Dongsha Islands is just around the corner. The front line greatly needs personnel. I'm wondering if you might be willing to take a post as head martial arts coach of the Guangdong and Guangxi navy to serve our country. Um... I'm just an ordinary person. I'm afraid I can't do the job. An ordinary person. It's good to know who you are. How dare you! Your Excellency, please pay attention to your bearing in Zhang's presence. Your Excellency. Zhang. It's a big issue, appointing the head coach. You should request instructions from the Ministry of Personnel and Privy Council. If Zhang acts like this, I'm afraid you'll be to blame for the dictatorship. Now, coast defense is an emergency. The Empress Dowager ordered me to act according to circumstances. Will you report on my dictatorship? I dare not do that. I'm just doing my duty to remind you. Your Excellency, according to urgent intelligence from the navy, it has been confirmed that Japanese warships will reach the Dongsha Islands in three days. Governor-general, head for navy camp immediately, and lead our troops in defending the Dongsha Islands. As long as the Japanese dare to land, you must fight to the death. Regarding the matter of backup, I will deal with it in person. Yes, Sir! Wait a moment! Zhang, your right to act according to circumstances doesn't include declaring war against Japan. The reason for the Treaty of Shimonoseki is to avoid war between China and Japan. It's about the war with great importance. You should request instructions from the Privy Council. After Li and the Empress Dowager have reached a decision, you will know what to do. Your Excellency, we're facing a monumental war. When the reply from central government arrives, not to mention the Dongsha, Xisha, and Nansha Islands, will all be occupied by Japan. The way you settle the problem is by putting our country's safety at risk. The Dongsha Islands are mostly deserted. Very few people live there. Many of the islands are unfit to live in. For these useless lands, starting a war puts the central government's safety at risk. I'm afraid I don't agree on this point. Though I'm just an ordinary person, I still believe that even one inch of land is worth fighting for, if it belongs to our country. Even though they live near the border in small numbers, we must protect them, as long as they're our compatriots. If a land is ignored because it's useless, and people are abandoned because they're only a few, then what is the central government for? You... Huang has a profound insight. I'm wondering, among the government officials present, how many of them share your opinion. I've made up my mind! Order all officials to do their part to prepare for war. Issue marine trade bans immediately to avoid private boats from entering the war zone by mistake, or from enemy agents delivering messages. Without a personally-sealed warrant from me, no one is allowed to go to sea. Yes, Your Excellency! Unless you order a cease-fire. Otherwise, any Japanese warships that dare enter our territory I will fight to the death. If the Empress Dowager would like to blame someone for the consequences, I would like to take them with you. Good! Then the front line will depend on you. Huang, now the country is in crisis. Every man has a duty to his country. As for the head coach position, I will decide for you. At Sishi (9 to 11 a.m.) tomorrow, I will hold the appointment ceremony for you in person. Your Excellency... That's settled! Zhang Zhidong deserves to be called "the last real man of the Qing Dynasty". He should not be afraid of Japan. He not only dares to fight to the death, but issued the marine trade ban. Yes. Your Excellency, he is committing suicide. There are assassins! Protect His Excellency! Catch the corrupt officials alive to offer as sacrifice to the King of Ming. Go! Protect His Excellency! Your Excellency, please go inside for a quick escape. The government is doing its job. Get out of the way! Please, Your Excellency! Your Excellency, come with me! You won't make it if you take me with you. Your Excellency. This is my gold seal. If it falls into Japan's hands, they'll definitely issue documents and change the big picture. You must take it, make your escape, and return with backup. Just leave me alone! I can't! Go! It's of great importance. This is an order. Your Excellency! Go! There's nothing they can do to me. Go! Go get backup and put down the White Lotus Society. Go! Your Excellency! Go! Look. Huang, your medicine has been ready. If you need anything else, please don't hesitate to ask me. Thanks a lot! You not only let us spend the night, but got my medicine ready. I don't know how to repay your kindness. You're my son Su's master. We've been good friends for many years. I'm glad to help. If you really wanna repay me, after you take the post tomorrow Kill more Japanese for me. He's gonna die. Shall we report to the local government? What are you talking about? How can you be so heartless? Come on! It seems that he has died. Kuan, Yue, go and check it out! Yes, Master! Shangguan. Master. Shangguan, what's wrong with you? Shangguan, what happened? Huang. The White Lotus Society... Go and save... save Zhang... Shangguan... Kuan. - Get him in. - Okay. Huang, please have some tea. No, thanks! Your Excellency. Huang. Sorry... I should call you Head Coach Huang. You are so active! Zhang can't have a ceremony for you until tomorrow. You... What's wrong? Zhang was kidnapped by the White Lotus Society! His guard Shangguan Ao told me. Where is Shangguan now? At my place, recuperating. He was severely injured, fighting the White Lotus Society. He remains in a coma. So ll came to earnestly ask you to send troops to rescue Zhang. These people are really lawless! I will do it immediately! Advisor, send Huang back. Thanks for the information! - Thank you! - I'll leave now! Okay. Please! Please stop here! Take care, Huang. How about sending someone to bring Shangguan back? Has he left? Yes. Your Excellency, I will send troops to close the whole city. Search for the White Lotus Society and rescue Zhang. Of course, we will close the whole city. As to Zhang's rescue... You mean... Zhang and Li have a bad relationship. If something bad happens to him this time, Li would be much pleased about that. You are so smart! I will block the information right now. Feihong. Shaojun. How is Shangguan now? Yue is taking care of him. He's still in a coma. What did he say? He agrees outwardly, but disagrees inwardly. He not only stands by and does nothing, but wants to borrow a knife to kill Zhang. Now our country is in crisis. But he is thinking about struggling for more power. This is what our country is reduced to. These governors are to blame. What are we gonna do? He holds the greatest power in Guangdong now. With such bad intentions. Zhang... is in a more dangerous situation. It's worse than that! Without Zhang making preparations for the war in the rear, the governor-general will face a more severe situation at the front line. If we lose this battle, all of Southern China will be in danger. What are we gonna do? Is there anything else we can do? Taking the present situation into consideration, we have no choice but to save Zhang ourselves. How? Maybe... we can try drawing the snake out of its hole. White Lotus Society? What are you talking about? May Bodhisattva bless me! Would you like to join the White Lotus Society? You must be a rickshaw puller. It's useless to worship the God of Earth. It's better to worship the King of Ming. Come and join the White Lotus Society. You're sure to walk as if on wings and even pull a rickshaw faster than others. I don't know what you're talking about. Can the King of Ming let me pull rickshaws again? I had an accident, pulling a rickshaw. Sir, are you interested? Join the White Lotus Society. You're sure to have infinite strength. Screw you! Hey, are you interested? Don't tell the others. You bucktooth, standing in the way of our business. I... I'm not... Get out of here! Daring to get in the way of our business! Get out of here! Hey, interested in the White Lotus Society? White Lotus Society? Hey, interested in the White Lotus Society? Get away! Don't get in my way. Fatso... I want them all. Give them all to me. Grandma, what do you want them for? To make a fire. Make a fire? Master, have some water. Master... they've been away for a long time. How come we haven't received any news? Don't worry! Just wait for the signal. Feihong. Shaojun. Yue, haven't they come back? It should be soon. Um... About those three moves you taught me before. I've practiced a lot. Just teach me some more. How about teaching me some basic stick skills? Okay, okay. Step on the foot, kick in the crotch, and attack the eyes. You've grasped these three moves. Now I'll teach you to use the stick. It can still make the three moves. Come on! Hey, you've been here for a long time. The Bodhisattva will bless you. I'll go home and have dinner. You go on. Thanks! Interested in the White Lotus Society? All right! I'm thinking about it. Look! Step on the foot, kick in the crotch. and attack the eyes. Signal flare! It's not. Have you ever seen a signal flare before? You think I'm stupid? It must be a signal... Fire! Look. It's the signal. Feihong, are you all right? I'm fine. Give me your compass. - Here you are! - Yue, prepare the horse for me. Master, it's already ready. Respectable King of Ming. Han Xi'er was born at Sishi (9 a.m. to 11 a.m.) on May 5th of the 11th year of Guangxu (1885). She is haunted by five ghosts. With eight monsters around, she can't recover. May the King of Ming grant me an elixir to get rid of the evil things. Abracadabra... Han Fu, the King of Ming showed its power and the holy water is ready. Take the holy water and save your daughter. Come on! Xi'er, be good. This is altar master's holy water. Drink it, and you'll get better quickly. It's okay. It's okay, Xi'er. Xi'er, It's fine. Come on! Those who obey the King of Ming shall prosper; those who resist shall perish. Listen to me! You'd better let me go now. My master is Huang Feihong. As long as you release me, and make a hundred kowtow to me, I will spare you. White Lotus Society! What are you doing? My master is Huang Feihong. Subdue demons and monsters! - What are you doing? - Welcome the King of Ming! - Abracadabra... - What are you doing? - Kill him. - My master is Huang Feihong. Kill him as a sacrifice to the King of Ming. Master. Master. Kuan, are you all right? Master, if you'd come a little later, I'd have been a roasted pig. Good. I'm hungry anyway. Master, help me save face. There are so many people present. Master? Are you Huang Feihong? No more nonsense! This is my master. He's Huang Feihong, and is popular with everyone. Handsome, with powerful Kung Fu. He's well-known in Southeast Asia. So you're Huang Feihong. Today, I will kick your ass. Kill him! Wow, so cunning! Shit! This knife hasn't been sharpened. How can I fight with you? I'm not playing with you anymore! Stop! Xi'er, wait here for me. Dad. I'm scared. Xi'er, don't be afraid. Dad is here with you. Don't be afraid! There are so many of you! Foshan shadowless kick. You're really annoying! Get my knife! I have magic powers to protect me. What can you do with me? Nonsense! Stop! Don't run! Catch him. Stop! Stop! Catch him! Stop! What magic powers? It turns out to be metal plates. Look. This is so-called proof against spear thrusts and sword cuts. He's obviously a liar. Don't listen to him. Kill him. I advise you not to do evil acts following him. Metal plates. Everything is false. Um... Your daughter has drunk so much holy water. Isn't there anything wrong with her? It turned out to be fake. Magic powers? Well done! Kill him. Kill him. Magic powers? Well done! Good! We've been kept in the dark for so long. Kill him! With the King of Ming as protection... Was it you, that kidnapped Zhang? Where is he now? Go to hell! Xi'er. What's this? Kuan, block their acupoints. Wait until the toxic smoke disperses. Okay, Master! Where on earth is Zhang Zhidong imprisoned? I'm afraid he has died. He is in the hands of... Why is this flag so heavy? It's you! It's me. Huang Feihong, do you miss me? Stop the nonsense! Hand Zhang over as soon as possible. Or else... I'll destroy your base camp. Go ahead! Make a mystery of simple things every day, and it's full of foul atmosphere. I don't like it anyway. After it's destroyed, I'll build you a new one. And you're the altar master. All wealth, all power and beauty... can be yours. Including me. Give me back my jade pendant. We traded, you and me. If you want it... come and get it. What trick is she playing? Let me have a look. Don't worry. The poison doesn't go too deep. It's nothing serious. But this little girl is seriously ill. Why didn't you take her to the doctor? I believed in the White Lotus Society and thought they could cure her. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be false. Huang, please save her. Huang. Please save us. Huang. - Please save us. - Huang, please! All right. Please be quiet. If you'd listened to me just now, you wouldn't be suffering like this. Kuan, go get brush and paper. Okay. Huang. All right. Don't worry. Your poison is not so serious. I will write you a prescription. According to this, you'll recover soon after taking the medicine. Thanks, Huang. And... I'll write you another prescription for your daughter. Take both medicines at the same time. It'll take effect in a day or two. Thanks, Huang. With healing hands, Huang is like Hua Tuo and our second parent. We took the altar master as God. But he took us for animals. Huang has saved us several times. We're willing to do anything to repay your kindness. You don't have to do that. As long as you can return to the right path, I'm happy to save your lives. - We will. - Thanks, Huang. Be a good person! Where is Zhang Zhidong imprisoned? He's not here. Last night, after we kidnapped him, altar master handed him over to Holy Mother. Holy Mother. Does she have other base camps? She is very mysterious. We don't know what she does. Master. Master, we really made a fortune this time. This sign is so familiar. Okay. Don't look for trouble! Okay. I'm afraid Zhang Zhidong has died. He is in the hands of... Order all officials to do their part in preparing for the war. Without a personally-sealed warrant from me, no one is allowed to go to sea. See. Kuan, - let's go! - Okay. How can you say the Japanese paid the White Lotus Society to kidnap Zhang? Your Excellency, the White Lotus altar master was killed the moment he said Kanna. And I found boxes with the sign of Kanna on them. They are full of... Huang Feihong, do you know what you're saying? Kanna Co., Ltd. has hundreds of shops in Guangdong. It contributes thousands of liang in taxes to the court every year. Their boxes appear in the base camp of the White Lotus Society. It doesn't mean anything. It's just some boxes. The Chinese working there can get them easily. Or people with ulterior motives seized a chance to add fuel to the fire. I lost! They set the Japanese up on purpose to cause conflict between the two countries. Your Excellency, Zhang is the person that worries Japan the most. To force him to stop the war, they took these measures. As to the stakes in this matter, please think it over. Huang. Huang. You're just an ordinary person. How dare you question the wisdom of His Excellency! This is the highest disrespect. Get out of here, now. Your Excellency, please don't go the wrong way because of infighting among officials and become known through the ages as the sinner against the Chinese nation. Master, will he send troops to save Zhang? We have to depend on ourselves. How is it going? I went to visit Uncle Lin. He told me there is indeed a Japanese chamber of commerce called Kanna. It has hundreds of shops. If we search one after another, not even a month is enough. Now the government refuses to help, and we don't have a clue. What should we do, Master? Master, let's try beating around the mountain to scare the tiger. Beat around the mountain to scare the tiger. Kuan. Master. Who are you? This is Huang Feihong, from Foshan. I didn't go to Baozhilin. You came by yourself. I'm not interested in challenging you. It's said you kidnapped Zhang Zhidong. Hand him over. Now. I advise you to listen to my master and release Zhang. Or I will not show any mercy and kick your ass. All of you... Kill them. Wait! Kuan, play it well later on. Master, okay. It hurts! Master, help me! Master. Kuan. It's too real! Help, Master! Can't take it anymore. We're no match for them. Let's go! Okay. Don't chase them. Huang Feihong is nothing more than this. Yes. Look how fast they ran! Zhang. I really admire you. But please understand me. The reason I've done this is because we hold different opinions. Zhang, please consider the current situation. The Qing Dynasty is on the way out. You'd better give up. As long as you end the war. I... Don't bother convincing me. Even if I fall, thousands of Chinese won't. Just forget about it. I really admire your courage. In that case, I have to get tough with you! Stop! Don't let him die. Yes. Deputy Commander. Commander. I'm here to report to you. I have finished the task and dealt with the matter of the White Lotus Society. So I came especially to report to you. You've done a good job. I will suggest a reward to army headquarters. Thanks for your cultivation. Will Zhang Zhidong cooperate with us? He is indeed "the last real man of the Qing Dynasty". Really tough! What should we do, then? Our warships are gonna land on the island tomorrow. How can we report to military headquarters? According to the army's decision, bring Zhang Zhidong to the warship as a hostage in secret. Zhang Renjun is his student. He won't leave Zhang Zhidong alone and declare war against us. But with the marine trade ban, we can't go to sea. Captain! Commanders. My work here is done. What about the local government? The stupid official has been thinking about infighting. He won't rescue Zhang Zhidong. Do you have Zhang Zhidong's gold seal? I went to his home and the government office, but no luck. You didn't find it! Just forget about it! Bring Zhang Zhidong to the sea. He wouldn't dare refuse us passage. Idiot! This fly is so annoying! Sorry for my offense! Commander. Shangguan is Zhang Zhidong's guard. The gold seal must be in his hands. As long as we find him, we can get it. Shangguan is in the house of Lin. Su. I'm telling you. Don't talk big anymore. I'm not. I'm telling the truth. Who is outside? I will go protect Shaojun. Go! Shaojun. Su, what's wrong? Assassins. Don't be afraid. I'm here to protect you. Shaojun. Step on the foot. Kick in the crotch. Attack the eyes. Shadowless kick! Shaojun, you're amazing! Step on the foot. Kick in the crotch. Attack the eyes. Gold seal. Step on the foot. Step on the foot. - Step on the foot. - Kick in the crotch. Attack the eyes. Shaojun. Don't come over. My master's really good at Kung Fu. Foshan shadowless hands. Yue, go protect Shaojun. - I'll take care of it. - Okay. Go to hell! Who are you? Su, are you okay? Let's go! This gang is so mysterious. It's so odd. There's nothing strange. They're afraid of my shadowless hands. Stop it! Rickshaw! Come and have a look! Sir! Big brother, we've won the fight. Let's go out and have some fun. Have fun? Where? Flower Street. The most famous in Guangzhou. - It's my turf - Flower Street. You're sure to have a lot of fun. Flower Street? I don't think that's a good idea. It's all good! Lots of beauties there. Stop it! Su, your father and master are both out. You can do whatever you want, right? You dare go to Flower Street! This is our way of having fun. Big brother, don't listen to her. Let's go! Let's go! I... Shaojun. Here you are! Right. Where did Rong and Su go? Su took Big brother to the brothels to drink wine. Brothels... to drink wine? Your master is not in. They'd better behave themselves. Go and bring them back. Okay. Take care! Why did he come to a brothel? Master, what should we do now? Follow them in. Okay. Commander, the martial club's owner is here. Commander! Come here. I have good news for you. You don't have to worry about Huang Feihong anymore. I've taught him a lesson. Sorry, sorry, sorry! Sorry, sorry! Sorry! You went to find Huang Feihong? No, I didn't. He came to challenge me, and asked me to release Zhang Zhidong. You idiot! You've exposed us. No, no. I beat him badly. He got no advantage on me. You've exposed this place to him. You want him to have more of an advantage? It's all my fault! Please spare my life! I underestimated Huang Feihong. I didn't expect him to be this brave and resourceful. By drawing the snake out of its hole, he's destroyed the White Lotus Society. This trick he's using is called beating around the mountain to scare the tiger. Interesting! Why don't I have such talent around me? Everyone who thinks themselves clever is stupid. We swore loyalty to the Mikado. But you broke your promise. You should kill yourself. Spare my life, please! Deputy commander, please help me! I thought you were just imprudent. So ll just tried it. But you don't even have the courage. You bring shame on the Japanese imperial army! Don't make me do it myself. Yes. Yes. I will offer an apology myself. Dad. I've brought your dinner. You're so happy. Your daughter can bring you dinner. Let's eat together. Have you taken your medicine today? It's not bitter at all. Come on. Let's eat. Hurry up! Hurry up! You Chinese are so slow. Didn't you have dinner? Hurry up! Let's eat together. Thanks, Dad. Dad, look! Huang saved us that day. Hurry up! Hurry up! Clean this up as fast as possible! Yes. Commander! Do you have the gold seal? Yes. Go get a carriage. Bring Zhang Zhidong to the dock and send him to the military warship. Go to sea immediately! Deputy commander! Master. The guest is being really troublesome. So is mine. The Japanese brought her. No. I think she is Japanese. Clean it up as soon as possible. Yes. Chuan, today is a special day. You must be on high alert. Don't let anyone strange in. They're indeed beautiful! There are many more over there. Isn't she the Holy Mother? Holy Mother... Why did she become a geisha here? Su. This must be Kanna's base camp. This Japanese woman surely knows where Zhang is. I'll go get her. You go look elsewhere. Okay, Master. Shangguan, you're awake. What are you looking for? My bag, my bag... Your bag? Is this one? Gold seal... Gold seal... What gold seal? This bag... The gold seal inside is Zhang's official seal. It's related to the fate of the Qing Dynasty as well as Zhang's itself. But today... Shangguan, don't worry. Lie down first. I'll go find Feihong and get the gold seal back. Huang Feihong. It's you. You hurt me. Cut the bullshit! Where is Zhang? You're so annoying. You should see me take a bath. Then I'll show you. Quit playing tricks. I can catch you with my eyes closed! Then come and get me. If you can catch me, Zhang and I are both yours. Stop! Who are you? We're here to have fun. Get out of here. We don't allow Chinese dogs in. Don't you know these words? What should we do? They're causing trouble. Who's making trouble out there? What Kung Fu is this? Guess! Shaojun is right. You're asking for trouble again. We're not the ones asking for trouble. They said Chinese dogs aren't allowed in. Where is Su? He got in. Holy Mother, where are you? Holy Mother. Someone's making trouble. Go help them. Close the gate! I don't know anything. Don't hit me! Don't come over. Xi'er, wait for me here. Don't move. This incense... Huang Feihong. It's too late. When the stupid martial club owner said he defeated you, I knew he'd fallen into your trap. You would follow him here, so I prepared the incense especially for you. Don't mention using Kung Fu. It's difficult to move. Help! Done! Help! Go! Go inform Xueji and see what's going on outside. Yes. Huang Feihong, don't bother trying to escape. As long as you're willing to be loyal to the Mikado, I can give you whatever you want. Forget it! We will send Zhang to our warship. The Dongsha Islands will fall into our hands. The Qing Dynasty, reduced to this. It won't be long before the Xisha and Nansha Islands, half of China... even the whole of China... one after another... fall into our hands. Once that happens, you'll have to work for the Mikado, too. We'll be together sooner or later. You are so smart. Why don't you consider the present situation? The Chinese nation has a big population. Your little country should want to conquer it. It's a joke, really. So you disagree. Deputy Commander, there are people making trouble outside. Commander let you get a look. I know! You stay here. I have enough time to change your mind. Stop! Who are you? Su, are you okay? Holy Mother. Su, Su. You... Holy Mother. Who are you? How dare you come here? Do you wanna die? I... Deputy Commander, they're Huang Feihong's students. When we attacked the house of Lin, we fought with them. Take them down! Pull his teeth first! - Go. - Yes. It's just that the White Lotus Society was destroyed. You don't have to give up on yourself! Help! Kuan, what are you doing here? It's a long story. Kuan, where is our master? Go find Zhang. Come on! Help, Master! Help, Master! Su, shut up! Master. Master, help! Master, Help! Master, help! Commander, it seems they're Huang Feihong's people. Help, Master! Master, help! Master. Master, help! Huang Feihong... where is he? Don't worry about it. It's just some of his pupils. Now is the most critical moment. Don't bother with other problems. Make a quick fight and Kill them all! Yes. Let's go! Isn't Master here? Su. I don't know where Master is now. Help, Master! Stop shouting! I'm coming! Master. Master. Master... That's my man. Master. Master! Are you all right? Huang Feihong. I've heard a lot about you. You are indeed a rare talent. If you agree to remain loyal to Japan, you'll surely gain unexpected rank and wealth. Don't bother. You can't buy me. You Japanese have done terrible things in China. Hand Zhang over as soon as possible! Let's see how capable you are. My knife! Commander! Advisor! You turned out to be a traitor. Shame on you! Forward! Stop! Don't run! Forward! Huang, we've come to save you! Kuan, who are they? Those who followed White Lotus Society. Master and I saved them. Then we'll kill them all. Kill them all. Shut up! Huang Feihong, there's an old saying in China. A wise man adjusts his actions to the times. If you give in now, it's not too late. Your Chinese is good. I'll teach you another saying. An unjust man is doomed to destruction. Put down your knife and submit without a fight. Dad... Go! Go! Get out of here! Go! I won't! I won't! Go! Dad... Go! Dad, wake up! Don't leave me. I'll bring you dinner every day. Please wake up! Kuan. He took the gold seal. Catch him and get it back. Hurry! Who are you? Where did you get this jade pendant? My man gave it to me. Your man? Shaojun. Attack the eyes. Kick in the crotch. Block the throat. Shaojun, stop getting in the way. Crouch down. Attack the eyes. Block the throat. One more move. My God! Foshan shadowless kick... Huang, we won! Huang, the child is fine. - Feihong, are you all right? - Master... I'm fine! Quickly, go get Zhang! Let's go! Huang Feihong, Huang. Am here. Huang Feihong, don't come over. Or I will kill him. You're such a traitor. There's nowhere to go. It's death, either way. Then I'll kill him first. Apologize to the Chinese! Zhang, Sorry I came so late. With real men like you in China, our country is filled with hope. As to the fate of the country, every man shares the responsibility. As long as we cooperate with each other, and all people unite as one, the Chinese will stand up! All people, uniting as one to overthrow imperialism and restore the Chinese nation. In 1907, Japan invaded and occupied the Dongsha (Pratas) Islands. After 33 years, Zhang Renjun successfully negotiated their return to China's rule. In 1909, the first year of Xuantong, Navy Commander-in-Chief Li Zhun, assisted by vice generals Wu Jingrong and Liu Yikuan and a unit of more than 170 soldiers, was dispatched to colonize the Xisha (Paracel) Islands aboard the warships Fubo and Shenbang. They secured and claimed 15 islands, engraving names on large stones to mark their territory. Raising their flag and firing cannons on Yongxing Island, China declared to the world that these islands were part of their sacred dominion in the South China Sea. They refused to surrender one inch of their empire You owe me an explanation. Why is my jade pendant in the hands of that geisha? It was an emergency. I used it to save Zhang. My things mean so little to you. You don't care about me. Shao Jun, you misunderstood me. I did? Then you gave it to her on purpose. Just say it! How is she better than me? You are better than her in every way. You compare me to a geisha. You look down on me. You don't care about me at all. Shao Jun. To me, you're the most important person. I'm the most important? Then why'd you give my jade pendant away? Don't be angry! No peeking! Okay. -1, 2, 3,4 - That's good. When the camera is on you, then you start your line. The move looks awkward. Let's try another move. There's no geniuses. Yes, I know. A sneaky person with no vision. There's someone better than you. Is that okay? Does it hurt? We would need to explain the details or we can't film. Let's try that. Move your legs slightly forward then the camera will follow. Nice. You're a natural. - That's dangerous. - Was that on purpose for another take? Move a little more. Okay, that's it. Cut! Let's take a look. Is that okay? The last move is not important. The horse is afraid to run. It's slippery and not gravel. He should move like this... The camera will be close to your feet. Don't let anyone strange in. Step forward. Step forward and stop. He is Huang Feihong. Do I do a double flying high kick? - Yes, kick high. - Yes. Smaller movements. Smaller movements. I think it's okay. Very nice. - Okay, that's good. - That's good. Hey! Happy filming!
