It was my idea, basically. It went back to something I did for an album called Skunkworks, one of my solo albums, when we actually took a very much smaller aeroplane, with little propellers on it, little piston engines on it, and we went and bashed our way round the US. And I thought, "Wow, why couldn't you do this on a bigger scale?" I think his real purpose in coming up with the idea is so he got two wages: one as a singer and one as a pilot. We were asked to go to Australia in '08, and we hadn't been there for a long time. We also wanted to go to South America, so if you think about doing Australia and maybe somewhere on the way, and then around South America, by scheduled airlines nowadays, with all the security precautions and everything else, and the way it's very hard to link up the freight and the flights efficiently, then it just seemed to be a good idea to see if there was some way of doing it. So I've put up this idea of an aeroplane, and I thought, "Can we get enough gear in the holds to make it viable?" And it became pretty clear that we couldn't, and I said, "OK, so why can't we use the back end of the aeroplane, "take the seats out and put a big cargo net in?" The idea of a splitter bus in the air just seemed to be ideal if it could be done, and Bruce was, from the word go, "We can do this," and he was like, Bruce, with so much energy straightaway, he was round Astraeus the next day talking about the concept and the principle, and they agreed it was doable, and so we went to quite immense logistics and bureaucracy to get it done. It's all very well, we're going to fly an aeroplane round the world but you have to think which markets to play in, and the logistic constraints, because obviously the aeroplane needs to stop at places and refuel, and that might not be where you want to go on the routing. I had this idea that we'd do around the world in 80 days, which, as a manager, I like to have things to hook things on, which have got a bit of a vibe to them. When the tour was finally finalised around August/September of that year, I counted the days from Moscow to the final date in Tampa, and believe it or not, it was 66 days. We're at romantic Southend Airport, and lurking over there is Golf Sierra Tango Romeo X-Ray, otherwise known as Ed Force One, in bits, because it's having a sea check. ATC Lasham are pulling the beast apart and putting it back together. And this is where I got my first job. Isn't that odd? It's a 757-200, with RB 211 engines. And it's going be here for approximately three weeks. The aircraft will be stripped down, a scheduled inspection carried out, any defects found will be rectified, put back together again, and then we'll do the combination cargo conversion into the Iron Maiden config, where the rear end is converted to a cargo compartment. We have the livery to be put on in the hangar, So, as you can see now, it's a nice blank canvas, and we'll add all the decals with Eddie on the tail, and the title down the back end, and it'll leave here early February, and positioned at Stansted, ready for its first trial load. Normally the band runs on a cycle of three/four/five years, there's that much forward planning goes on in what the band might be doing. Discussions on the production start very early. We do build the tours around the album. Bruce came up with the title and I think it's just a bit of mischief from him really, because he had the idea that people would think it actually was the final tour. We all had it in the back of our minds that it wouldn't be really the final tour, but I suppose it was a good little bit of gamesmanship from him, really. Once you've got that idea, the basic idea, then it just lends itself to all the imagery for the set, for backdrops, for Eddies and everything else. The hardest part is finding that little spark in the first place. Once you've got that, I'm not saying it's plain sailing, it's a lot of hard work and a lot of fretting and sleepless nights when you're writing, but you've got the initial idea, and you're up and running, really. Well, somewhere, here at ATC Lasham, there is a big white bird, which should be in a few bits. Through this door, should be... Bingo! An aeroplane, there you go, with its nose slightly out of joint, Golf Sierra Tango Romeo X-Ray, otherwise known as Ed Force One. And yeah, there she is, in bits, partially. The thing that has completely changed the dynamic of our touring is the fact that we're flying everywhere on Ed Force One, and certainly for me, there's a heck of a lot more work to do with regards to everything with the plane. I have to look after the catering side of things, where everyone is seated, how much luggage we're allowed to carry, and way in advance of all of that, we have to make sure everyone's got the correct visas as well. Visas are the most difficult thing to get. I start, for a tour in January, I usually start round about August. Now, we've all got two passports, some of us more, and it's quite legal to have two passports. Because we've probably got 15 visas to get, in such a short period of time, because you can't apply for the visas unless you're within two months of actually going to the country. So you can't get the visas, but we get all the paperwork and everything done in advance. So we've got two passports, one lot of passports for the first part of the tour, and then while we're out on tour, we then get the second one sent to us with the next lot of visas in. Could you prepare your boarding pass? We're travelling to so many different countries, we have to have the correct paperwork, of course we do, like anybody else travelling to these countries. We're travelling en masse, so if one person doesn't have the correct paperwork, then it holds everything up, and there's that whole knock-on effect that everything gets stalled. Before dates are confirmed we basically work on a number of budgets, based on alternative routes and different options. Rod and I go through those figures, and then Rod basically works with the agent to put together the final details of the tour. We're obviously covering some territories we've never been to, so there's been interesting challenges in terms of going to Korea and those Pacific Rim countries that we've never been to before. I have been working for 30 years, since I was born. I think the current economic environment does bring challenges even to an act as successful as Maiden doing very well in terms of ticket sales. Fuel prices change so dramatically that one has to be looking at forward buying fuel. Everything around the plane is complicated, you don't just get in a 757, put your gear on and fly off. It's all advance work. The plane dictates what you can take. Nothing else dictates it. And then you've obviously got guitar preferences by the musicians, which depends on the songs, so lots of compromises all the way through. Because the cargo compartment has to be separated in its entirety from the passenger compartment, we had to put a bulkhead in at this position and reline the entire end of the aircraft. Before we did the trial loading, we had to work out exactly how many pallets we could put in, and to what maximum sizes we could accommodate. We want the monitor effects... My job on tour is quite simply to look after all the logistics of the equipment and the aircraft. So, essentially, I am responsible for both loading and unloading the aircraft, also then sorting out customs, local trucking, and getting the gear from show to show to show. We're obviously prepping for the next round-the-world tour, and essentially today we were just practising loading the pallets, that go at the back of Ed Force One, in the combi section, which basically is backline, monitors, front-of-house control, and this is the heavyweight equipment without which we can't do the show. Adrian's amps. Can we try and build something and then...? Take the weights and then we'll try and build it... OK. What's the designation of this box, then? What're we going to call this box? - That's a monitor. - Monitor FX. What we're trying to do is work out the weight of all the equipment, and put it in the best possible orientation, in a small area on the floor, which represents the size of the pallets on the aircraft. We marked out the size of the pallet, the allowable size of the pallet dimensions that we can use, and had to work within those restrictions, and also there's a height restriction, so it all has to be loaded and there has to be a flat top, it has to be square, which causes some problems. We have to put packers in, and again, if you're putting packers in, you have to take that into account for the weight limit as well. So if you put a packer in, you might have to take a bit of equipment off. Always a problem. Oh, well, there we are. I wish I was a flight case, cos that's the way I'd be coming in, actually. In and out of here, and pretty much this would be the cargo bay. We wouldn't have any carpet down, and it would be all lined, and we'd have some steel plates in the floors as spreaders, but basically this section here would be where we'd put all the Iron Maiden kit. Doing Ed Force One this time around, the trip on the plane presents enormous problems. We'll probably get a heads-up of a year, nine months, before the tour happens. And we'll then go and have a meeting with Rod, and he'll give us maybe an album name or just a gem of an idea, which we'll go away with and come up with some designs for the set. A lot of the ideas do come from the band initially anyway, so we'll give them what ideas we have, and we'll try and paint a picture for them in words, if you like. Sometimes I'll send them some images that I'll pull up from wherever, just to give them some sort of basic idea of what I think, the direction they should be going in. The brief that we got, I think, was we need to have a space station that's at the dirty end of the universe. It has changed a little from this point, and it does extend a little more left and right, but the innovative thing was putting the large towers upstage left and right, which made the whole thing in the region of 100 feet across, which is pretty big. Yeah, Hangman will send us initial drawings of what it's going to look like. We'll move that on a bit until we're all happy, and then they'll do a model, and then we'll sign it off, and they'll start building it. It then becomes a massive intense period of drawing, CAD drawings, designing, art working, also talking to all the crew, talking to the tour manager, the production managers, to make sure that not only does it look good, but that it'll go on a truck or in a plane, and be easy to put up every night, easy to take down. We've got artists here, sewers, computer graphics guys, over at Metalman we've got welders, and basically it then all has to happen. And usually by that point, we've not got very long left. It's always the same, I don't know why, but no matter how much time we have on these things, it always ends up: "We ain't got any time at the end of it!" We'll still use the drapes, it's just different. There are a lot of big screens around nowadays with wonderful pictures and everything else, but there's something more theatrical and dramatic about the drapes. We're messing around with the colours. We're seeing what brings out the most of the 3-D effect of the drops. We're doing a demo, looking at the new drapes, seeing how they'll respond under concert lighting conditions and getting the most out of them, and the band are checking them out. The rest of it looks great, but he just needs to stand out and he doesn't. It's very flat lighting at the moment, so lighting will make a difference. The figure itself needs to be dark, the dark bits need to be more black... - Up the contrast. - Make the thing stand out. The last two months have been pretty much constant prepping for the round-the-world part. There's a lot of different lighting companies to deal with all over the world, and we have to recreate the show to the last light bulb from here to Jakarta, so there's quite a lot to do. As you can see, these are the engine logos. These logos will be inboard and outboard, so whoever's flying on the aircraft will see the skull from the inside of the cabin. We acquired the graphics from Peacock Design. We take those graphics and superimpose them onto a schematic of the aircraft. We scale everything up from templates, and reproduce the graphics from there. It's a 10-year vinyl and it's quite high-quality vinyl, which is like Formula One racing cars. From when it's printed and when the vinyl's actually cut, the next stop for us is to get all the graphics boxed up, ready to go, and sent to the hangar where Ed Force One will be applied. It's basically like a big jigsaw puzzle, so they use the drawing, and it's all scaled up for the fin, and each section of decal is just placed up in position. They start from the bottom corner and work their way forward, and all the way up, until you get the final bigger picture. To do the whole livery including the fin, we're looking at about three to four days, depending on how many guys we get on it. We're on schedule to finish by end of Wednesday, beginning of Thursday. We're in Paris in a rehearsal room, and just finished rehearsals. We got one more rehearsal before we head off on Final Frontier Part Two. The elements of the production are based round the set-listers. For the round-the-world leg, there are a lot of new places and a lot of new people we've never played to, so you've got to be a bit more generous. Talisman was a decision that we needed to make, When The Wild Wind Blows picked itself, and as for the rest of it, we thought we'd put a few more songs back in. We circulate a copy of the set between us a couple of weeks before we get to rehearsal. You know you're going to be playing Hallowed Be Thy Name, you know you're going to be playing Iron Maiden, so it was just working in a couple of new songs, really. Obviously, a lot of the older songs, they came back immediately, but songs like When The Wild Wind Blows are a little more involved, and there's a lot of highs and lows in the song. Wild Wind Blows actually is a lot of fun to play live, it's got some really good grooves in it, and it's like your classic Maiden epic, So, yeah, all good stuff. Looking forward to playing the new songs, it's good fun for us, keeps us on our toes. I just hope we can remember it all on the night. Trying to get the set to gel altogether was difficult, because it was a very different paced set to the one that we're used to, in particular because we're starting with a mid-tempo type number, and it requires a great deal of restraint on the part of the drumming department. You need to be focused, and you need to be quite disciplined on where the set starts, because that way it can build and build and build throughout. Yeah, been rehearsing for just over a week and a half now. We've got one more tomorrow, one more run-through. The new songs we're doing off the new album sounded really good. And, yeah, we're all excited to be... off we go, you know. You find once you get out there it's good fun, you get in front of the audience and you connect with the audience again, and you realise why you do it. When you're rehearsing in an empty room, you sometimes wonder why you do it, cos this band feeds off an audience, and that's where it comes alive. You can rehearse till the cows come home, but it's only when you get on stage that first night, and everything falls into place. We're feeling pretty confident, a little tentative on a few little bits here and there, but, I mean, that's always the way. I think, really, it'll take a couple of gigs before we really settle down. The first one will be a bit nervy, as usual. When you're doing new material, then it's always a bit nerve-wracking. But basically it's going well. It has to really, don't it? We're ready now. Here we are on Ed Force One, or Ed Force One And A Half, I suppose. It's a different aeroplane this year, the registration was India Bravo last year. We've got a different aeroplane, about ten years newer than the previous one, this one's Romeo X-Ray. So we've put in some nice business class seats, we've put in some new carpets, we've cleaned everything and sorted everything out. I wouldn't say it was the lap of luxury but it's jolly comfy. So here we are in what would normally be 60 passengers sitting in this compartment space, and a galley and a couple of toilets. It's all gone, we've lined it with a cargo liner, and there's various information on here in terms of the loading, and how much load we can put in, and where it's situated on the aircraft along the walls. To accomplish the loading, we've got these five steel plates here, which in effect are pallets, the load sits on those. Five of them, about a ton apiece, so about 5,000 kilos of stuff goes in here. The only restriction is everything has to fit through the main doors. As long as it'll go through here, it'll go on board the aircraft. Morning. Dreadful, isn't it? Well, here we are, on the Embankment on our way to Stansted. I'm in civvies at the moment. Uniform's in the back, so I shall be finding a phone booth and having a convenient change of clothes. You'll believe a man can fly. So we'll be on our way to Moscow shortly, which I expect will be...cold. I figure eight hours to load this, the first time cos Jeremy has to find out where everything's going to go. We're bringing a bigger show to the fans this time. This is earmarked to go in the front hold, as and when I start packing it. It's a bit of a Tardis. This is such a unique aircraft, and it's such a unique way of touring around the world. Loading it, on average anywhere between four to five hours. I have worked with lots of other bands, A-list bands, and I don't know of another act who would take this risk and downsize their equipment to such a level. It's a high-risk strategy in terms of the people, the aircraft, the crew. You know, everything has to slot into place. It's a big wheel, I'm just one small cog of that. The amount of flying we're putting on the aeroplane is actually not that great, because we tend to fly, and then the plane sits on the ground for 24 or 48 hours whilst we do a gig, and then it flies again, so it only flies when it needs to, for us. In normal service, one of these aeroplanes, we would be hoping to do about 350 hours a month, if it was flying for an airline or a contract. We are only probably putting about 100 hours on the aeroplane in two and a half months. And here is Stansted. What keeps everybody awake at night is thinking of what you haven't done. Because the band have been around for so long, but also because of the changes in the industry, there's a phenomenal amount of detail, as compared to just the core of major things that probably were the key things in the business 30 odd years ago. And, you know, you're permanently worrying about have you thought of every detail, have you covered every detail off, in the various deals and transactions and things that have been set up. In terms of flying, the most stressful things about flying on this particular tour, are actually not to do with the actual flying bits of it, they're to do with the administrative bits of it, because so much of planning a tour like this is down to the admin of it. There's no real slack in any of it. It's not like, "Oh, we can come back tomorrow and get it to work."” It's got to happen exactly on those days, and it's got to happen like clockwork. See you later hopefully. 50, 40, 30, 20, 10. We're in Moscow and it's snowing, and it's cold. It's snowing and it's getting colder. Tomorrow will be much colder, unfortunately. You'll never guess where I am. Three degrees difference, 15/18 degrees, who cares, it's bloody freezing, but, look at this, what an amazing place, the first place on the tour. What can I say? Na zdorovye. - How far did you come? - It's eight hours, eight/nine hours. Specially for this concert, specially to meet him, and specially for Iron Maiden, Iron Maiden's the best. The fans have been brilliant. They've been waiting in the freezing cold. God knows how they do it. We're standing here since nine o'clock in the morning. This is it, it's the old Olympic arena, which is a massive building. Absolutely freezing outside, minus 20 degrees, so the doors have just opened out there, and some cold fans will start coming in, but I'm sure we'll warm them up. It's good to get these tours rolling. We've been planning it for months and months and months, of course, and it's great to finally get everyone out on the road. As you saw, we had a little run-through, a little demo version of the intro, going through a few ideas with Steve and Bruce and the rest of the guys there. I think we've got a little concept. I'll put those ideas into a cue stack, so I'm not spinning plates at front of house tomorrow night on intro. The lighting guy, Rob, is really good. He's a Maiden fan, so it makes a big difference that he's a fan of the band, and I think he knows what the band should be looking like, and what the band want, kind of thing. We've got about 80 odd moving lights, all split evenly between washes and spots. We've also got these great big wash lights, LED rings. They're show beams with a 2.5k bulb, they're pretty punchy. We have nice LED strips around the chevrons, that highlight the shapes of the truss, and we got a few hundred PAR cans thrown in for good measure, just to beef up the whole thing, not to mention all our audience crowd-blinders and follow-spots. We don't bring anything, we just bring a lighting desk. All I've got is my lighting desk and these truss borders. Every single nut, bolt, bulb, cable, is all supplied locally. I have to advance this stuff with a series of diagrams and equipment lists, and 3-D renderings and everything else you can think of, with about 30 individual lighting companies, who all then give me their interpretation of what I've asked, and then we have to fine tune it, and end up with something resembling this every day. One of the hardest things is, no matter how much effort we put into all this, and all the care and attention we put in, a big part of the show is the follow-spots, and we're putting it in the hands of people I've never met before, who don't speak English and definitely haven't seen Iron Maiden before. Upstairs and... vamos! I can do it in French, Portuguese, Spanish and German, which has helped a helluva lot, but my Russian and South Korean left a little to be... This has become a pretty busy part of the show now. Jesus! I'm getting stressed. I'm getting stressed. Get the promoter to come and tell these three security guys that we've got to open these doors to get our stuff out. The important thing when you're loading out, especially somewhere like Moscow at 01:00 in the morning and minus 18, is to make sure you're wearing long trousers. I want to make sure everyone's responsible for their gear. So each department dedicates one person, until that gear is locked up in the back of the truck. Putting it to the dock or handing it to Bill and the stagehands isn't good enough. I want eyes on that gear until it's locked, cos as you know, like the last tour, shit walks. These go downtown, boys. And where else are we worried about? Jakarta. Jakarta's going to be, as you're all fully aware, the show that we're having the most trouble with at the moment, and that's basically cos at the moment we don't have a show. We've been trying for months, we're sending Uncle Dickie down there, he's going to leave tomorrow. So that'll either make it better or worse, we'll see. So here we have show two on the Iron Maiden round-the-world tour. Last night at 9:00, they tore down Eric Clapton and began to build our show. I came down a couple of months ago and did a site visit, had a quick look round the venue, went and met the sound company, went through all the monitor rig with them, because they offered me something I hadn't used before, so I wanted to listen to it. I had a day out here, which is nice, had a listen to the gear, which was fine. We basically carry Bruce's wedges and we carry the drum fill, we carry the desks, and everything that connects the desks together, and then the local companies supply the stacks, basically, amplifiers and speakers. We have a list of what we like to use, we send that out, they send us a list back, saying we don't have this, we have that system, we don't have that system, and it just goes backwards and forwards, until we get to a point where everybody's happy. Then we turn up on the day and, hopefully, they turn up with the same gear they told us they'd bring us. So we're going into a venue every day using a completely different system, and we've just gotta make it work, and make it work so the band are happy on stage. If it all plugs in on a daily basis, turns on and fires up, no problems, but that's the importance of the prep, most of it's all about the prep work. We supply the sound equipment that Iron Maiden use when they go on tour. There are discussions as to what's logistically possible as far as sound is concerned, moving the systems. We would send out a technician on the tour, Mike Hackman, he designs the system for each venue that he goes into, because each venue is a different shape, it's a different size, and has different acoustics. The sound department has 20 pieces, which includes the consoles, the ancillary racks, the multi-core system, and some essential key man monitoring. We changed the consoles to digital consoles, so they're small enough, they're compact, and we know they're going to fit into the aircraft, so we've got two ton on the plane. I need to get the channels from the stage into here, to get them out to him, because he wants specific channels that he's set up, and we'll have to soft-patch it all on the front of here. I'll do that with him. Usually once we've done all this in the warehouse, it works, and it's very rare we have to mess with anything. Obviously, we do get things go down, mikes go off, mike cables go down, channels on the multi-pins pack up, and we just deal with it. Basically, I look after the whole stage end of the show, so if anything goes down, it's down to me to fix it. This is my world and everybody else keeps out of it. And I'm now going to attempt to patch it, so stuff goes where it's supposed to be. I can't count. Sixteen... We're done! It wasn't actually that quick. They just edited all the long swearing bits out of the middle. After today, we're going to fly to Indonesia, Jakarta, and in fact, probably the first time that a production of this size and a band of this size have played there in a long time, and that has been a challenging show. We're going to have to make the show work. Bali's a smaller venue. At the moment they don't have enough PA on the island to actually fulfill our requirements. So, at the moment, they're looking for more PA, and we really won't know how good that PA is until we actually get there, plug it in and make some noise through it. We had a lot of problems up front, but I didn't actually decide finally until about two days before we were due to arrive there that we were going to go. Dickie had to go out from Moscow early to try to put a crew together, we had to get a new production manager, almost start from scratch. I had a sleepless night about three nights before, wondering are we going to do this or not. Iron Maiden, welcome to Jakarta, yeah! We're from Indonesia, we love you! Up the Irons! We waiting for Iron Maiden to come here almost 20 years. All my friends in Indonesia come from every single city, from different directions, they finally found their idols here. They forget their religion, they forget their skin, they forget everything, they just want to hear and sing Iron Maiden songs. You wouldn't call this our normal stage. This is the show we had a lot of trouble getting together. Really nice people who haven't done many shows here. The stage is made up of all sorts of different steel, towers and trusses and there's like loads of it back here that's all rusty. It's all a little bit bent. God, this stage has got a helluva slope on it! I spent two months asking them if there's any layer scaffolding available. They told me there wasn't. This is the first thing I found when I walked into the building. Loads of it. When you hit it, it becomes white smoke. It's a fire extinguisher. What you have is the wrong stuff. You just brought CO2 gas. Is there a fire station near here? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Some firemen? - Yeah. That's the show power right there, the whole lot. Don't fall into that, that's all live, that whole thing is live. You know, obviously what we're used to IS a door that's closed, when you open it, it disconnects everything, it makes it safe. This is completely live, the whole lot, and if it rains, it's going to be getting wet. Standard procedure is a bomb dog. We're going to check the production office for bombs. We're doing it all over the venue, and it's serious, it's a serious threat. So the dressing rooms are safe, we didn't find any bombs in there, which is nice to know. Some tours go dead easy, some go a little bit awry, and as you know, in Indonesia, there were a few hiccups there. - What have you got in here? - Oh, my god! This isn't the same as the photograph that we sent you. It was heartening to me to talk to Dickie, a couple of days before, he was getting all very defensive about the production crew there, saying, "Well, they're really nice people, the most wonderful people, "and they're trying really hard." It ain't going to work. From really this nightmare scenario three days before, then it ended out to be a pretty cracking show. It's nice, Jakarta, isn't it? I haven't been out much, due to the fact someone said I might get kidnapped! It was a really good gig in the end. I thought it was going to be one of the worst and a nightmare, but it turned out all right, the tower's still standing, the set's still standing. It was all pretty good, a nice easy day. Yeah, a good gig, went really well, actually. Got the full show up, all the drapes, the only thing that was missing was probably the CO2 effect. They just brought us the wrong stuff, basically. But yeah, we're all a bit tired, and we're heading to Bali next for our second Indonesian show. And we're getting bitten by mosquitoes. Nighty-night. Playing in Bali was absolutely tremendous and the feeling that they generated, a beautiful culture, a beautiful nation of people there, so it really had a kind of spiritual feel about that show. It's definitely unusual here. We don't usually play quarries. But we've got really high walls here so it's like playing in a cardboard box without a roof on top of it. We'll try to aim the PA so it doesn't bounce off the walls too much. Cos the sound hits that wall, it hits that wall, it hits that wall, and then comes back at us. I've mixed the audio for Iron Maiden since December '79. I mix the front-of-house sound. I mix for what the audience hears. From here I can make it sound real good, but I can't see what's happening up in that corner of the room or that part of the ballpark or whatever, so it's Mike's job to make sure that what I'm doing here gets to all the people. Expectations for sound these days are a lot higher. The sound systems are much, much better. I think the audience, they listen to sound all the time now on CDs. Ten, fifteen years ago, it was a different story. If you sat at the back of these places, you didn't expect to hear it so well. So here we have the actual main PA system. We have two hangs per side: one covers the main front part of the audience, and another, exactly the same size, covers the outer part of the audience. We have four delay speakers. Where we're standing here, we're 80-90 metres from the PA. If you were seeing the band in a normal big arena, a sports arena, you'd be at the very back at this position. If you look up to the back here, we've probably got another 100 metres of throw to the very back. So, what we do is we put in another set of speakers, we have two sets here that cover the very back of the arena, and then we have speakers on the side, to cover the very top sides of the arena. There's big distances between all the different speakers, so the first job is to ensure that all those speakers are all lined up. The sound from every speaker reaches the audience at the same time, then, once I have it aligned, my job is to tune the system, and make the system itself sound good for the room. So when we then put the mix through it, it hopefully sounds good, and we get a good interpretation of Doug's mix to every seat in the house. While Mike is doing his timeline, I'm typically on stage putting the mikes on the drum Kit, the backline, wiring things up. The backline guys will make some noise through each of their guy's rigs, guitars and on the drums, Mike plays keyboard, until they're all happy with their equipment. Then we do a full-on sound check, and I do my last tweak until it's as close as I can get, barring not having an audience in the room or in the field, for Iron Maiden readiness. Seven shows in Australia, it's like a mini tour. We've taken on an Aussie crew, got our own lighting crew, our own sound crew, we got our own trucks for the next seven shows, which will be nice. It's going to be more like the regular touring like we do in US and Europe. We'll still be using the plane, the crew will be travelling on the plane, but all our equipment will be in the trucks. I tell you the biggest problem I have right now is we're not putting equipment in the plane, so that means we all have to sit in the back of the plane for take off, cos there's not enough weight, that's my biggest logistical problem. I've got three 48ft trucks, we carry our set in one and a half of them, we carry extra lighting in the other half, and we carry our backline and monitors and front-of-house in the third one. It's pretty much a breeze to load in and out. We flew over our set, our rolling set, because we need to get out of the way on a festival situation, so other bands can play in front of us. As you can see, we're having fun with our own stage set. When we were in Norfolk months ago, loading a container with the stage set, well, this is it in Australia, and we're using this throughout this leg. It saves people building one for us, which is very nice. It's so much easier, it has wheels for a start! All the backline can live in it, all the carts and all the decorations, everything can all live in there. We're getting in there early so we can get the set here, and work out how it's all going to fit in with everyone else. We've got Sydney Festival tomorrow, we don't get there till two in the afternoon. The doors are already open, the show's already started, so we need to build our set behind a blackdrop, and it's just Bill's job and the local stage manager Dougal's to keep it organised, cos really, really quickly it could turn into a complete cluster. A festival's a festival, at the end of the day. It's one of those days where you can do so much, and you have to wait for all the bands to get off stage, and then hope everything's working fine because you haven't had much time. Everybody else has been on the stage. You just hope everything's working. We're trying to make some noise by 6:00, so I've only got an hour and ten minutes to get it all going for Doug. This whole last bit of tour has been pretty elastic, doing festivals for example, a back-to-back festival, we might not get there till 11:00 in the morning, and the doors are at 2:00, so it's like panic. What comes off the truck first, whatever it is, go ahead and set that up. Obviously it's not just about ourselves. With all the other bands on, it's going to be a real tough one. We'll be here for ten, twelve hours tonight to get this stuff built. That's what we have to do. Yeah, just these lights to go up and then we'll bring the carts in, and try and get a set built as much as we can tonight. And now this is the fun part of festivals, where we have to take certain bits of it apart, and move it for other bands to get on and off. Luckily, on this one, we're hoping we can leave the riser and the two backline carts. The next problem is created because of this, cos normally when we would roll these carts on, we'd have room here, but obviously today we haven't cos of the structure. Where the guitar amps would live here... Sean Brady looks after Adrian Smith... that cart could come crashing straight through it. So we gotta let everybody know, cos they're going to build all their well tomorrow while we're not here. That's the thing with festivals, every day we have to change, every day there's a new problem. Here we are at Soundwave, the first day, Brisbane, 47,500, sold out a while ago. A load of great bands, we're gonna play to a whole load of people we haven't played to before. We've only played Brisbane once in the last 20 odd years. Last time we did about 12,000 people, so there's gotta be a big amount of travellers, 30,000 haven't seen us before, so it'll be interesting, it'll be fun. It's always good to play to a new audience, because it makes them work hard to get them into the family. I'm expecting a really good day. With Maiden this year, it's the biggest one we've ever had. When we were in the planning stage about a year or so ago, we knew we were going to be in Australia around this time of year. I suggested to management perhaps we should look at playing the festivals, rather than do our own arena shows here. Maiden's the biggest act on the bill. We increased the size of our stages to accommodate them. We start working on this about June each year, slowly building up as the year goes on. We're going to move 70 bands, eight stages, overnight. We have two sets of production, two sets of lights, sound, video, staging, which leapfrog themselves around the country. I'm just a mere pawn in the whole organisation. At the moment we're doing the packs for all the workers. I think we're doing around 1,500 meals for the whole day between workers and bands as well. Roughly, how much beer have you got here? Truckloads. Probably two or three semi loads. We got a lot of beer. Beer! Today's been really successful. We lucked out with the weather. Everything's ticking over quite well now. We've got ourselves into the groove a bit, and here we are. This is a Monday, so obviously it's like a national holiday in Australia. The place is completely sold out. Always love playing Australia. The Soundwave Festivals are fantastic. Backstage is really nice, and we had that guy turn up with weird animals, and seeing other bands, which, it's nice to do gigs with other bands. We're quite isolated, we do our shows, we've got our audience, which is great, but it's nice to get the energy, it's a different energy at Oz festivals. - Happy birthday dear Adrian - Thank you very much. - Happy birthday to you - You're doing this just for the camera. - And many more - Not too many more! I've still got it, mate, I've still got it. We're going to have a late loading, so it's going to be a rush for tomorrow. We just land straight for the gig, and then if the trucks are there, load it in straight away. We're looking at about 1:00, I believe. Come down! The train hook has come out the top of the piece. There's no way to lift this up, we have to lift this up to dismantle it. Robbie, clip yourself in there, right? I'm going to send you up a rope. There's no physical structure there, just the actual curtain side of the stage, and obviously, working in the dark with no safety rails, they gotta stay clipped on at least two points. If one of them guys falls... no rock 'n' roll show's worth that, So, yeah, it's that classic story of safety first, you know. Andy's just putting a rope across it now, just so we can keep the weight of the tower. The danger is it could swing about 20 foot across the stage, hit the lights and bring the lights down on everybody, so it's "slowly-slowly-catchee-monkey” on this one. Nobody got hurt, most important thing. Nothing else really matters today. Yeah, serious pack-up this time. We have to trim down back to our fighting weight of 12 tons. So that means our rolling set has to be packed into a sea container, to go forth to England for the summer tour, and then there's the normal stuff that goes into the back of Ed Force One. So it'll be a little bit longer load-out and more breaking apart of things that normally we just throw right in the truck, and use it the next day. My boys did an hour-and-fifteen-minute load-out the last show, it was really good. That's it, good night, Australia! February 9th, we started this part of the tour and today we're in Adelaide, 6th March, and so far it's 18,000 shots. I'm averaging about 1,000 pictures per show, and then you've got all the shots that come outside, with the plane, with the loadings, at the hotels and things like that. So at the moment, it's 18,000, and my job is to edit them down to the cream of the crop, they're the ones that go out. We're just about to do portraits of the band in front of the plane, and you would think this sort of thing would be simple, but it isn't. It involves many people clearing runways and taxiways, getting special permission to park the plane here, so we haven't got any clutter behind it. And also we're getting the wind moved, so it's blowing in the other direction, so it'll be better for the pictures... If only that was true! Probably started working on this four months before the start of a tour, and you've got to look at everything from runway slots, traffic lights, which airports you can actually fly this type of aircraft into. Some airports are really difficult to land at the times Iron Maiden require, so you have to do a lot of negotiations with airports and their marketing teams, and also work closely with the promoters. I've been working on the catering for the plane about a month prior to leaving. So we've had a thorough scout through all the menus that have been supplied by all the various catering companies, and hopefully come up with a really concise and varied menu for each of the flights we're taking on Ed Force One. We always uplift water for the passengers, water for the crew, and make sure they get the milks for our teas and coffees, any extras, orange juice... Quite a lot of drinks are consumed on board this throughout the tour. We talk about all the logistics of transport, and how we're going to put everything together, and ensure that all the vehicles are at the airport waiting for the band. Working out the logistics of once we get to the country, how we're getting to the venues and getting to the hotels, and all of that is all planned in advance as well, which Steve Gadd does for me. The minute we land, you get away from the airport, where there's up to a thousand people there, watching the plane come in, and you think you're out of Dodge, but you're not, because at the hotel there's five hundred people camped out at the hotel. So the band are always signing autographs and stuff like that. Till you get 'em in the rooms, once you get the guys in the rooms, it's like, job done. We then headed to Japan, which was a really exciting time for us. We were going to do two shows in Tokyo. Everyone was looking forward to the shows so much, and certainly from the advance point of view, everything had gone very smoothly, and everything was in place for the two Tokyo shows. We were up in the air about ten minutes away from landing at Tokyo, when they had a massive earthquake. We haven't any further details on the earthquake at the moment. Simply that, obviously, it's fairly serious. The whole of the airports in the region are closed, and there is no determination as to when they will be able to accept aircraft. Air traffic control, as you can imagine, ls under some stress at the moment. We've made a decision early to go to Nagoya, where we get on the ground and find out what the situation is, put some more petrol on the aeroplane, and then see how we can resolve the situation. We've landed now at Nagoya, a lot of aeroplanes all diverting, it sounds very serious, it was an 8.8 magnitude quake, just north of Narita. We can't get hold of anyone in Tokyo. All the phone lines are down, all the cell... I got through to a landline, but there was a recorded message in Japanese, which of course I don't understand. If there's going to be a show, I think the sensible thing at the moment for us would probably be to leave the aeroplane here and truck the equipment in and out, if there's going to be a show. But by the sounds of it, that's sounding increasingly unlikely. The show must go on, but we really don't know what's happening at the moment. So it's a question of, do we stay here? The airports are still closed. Both airports are closed in Tokyo, so that means it's something relatively serious, and we'll...we'll figure out. There's a rumour that there's a 20-metre tsunami. But how...? As we said, we just don't know. So here we are, it's the morning after, we're still having shakes and quakes and stuff going on, aftershocks, but we're in Nagoya safe. We're about to get back on our buses and head back to the aeroplane, now that we've got a game plan and a decision, and we're going to fly onto Mexico via Hawaii. That morning the first show was cancelled, it seemed fairly obvious as the news unfolded, that the second show would be cancelled. In light of everything else, that's all pretty secondary. We just send our love and best wishes to all Japanese fans and Japanese people. It's a digital desk. It's got a capability of 120 inputs, 30 outputs. We actually use 22 of those. There's actually 20 mixes, everything's different, totally different. The band want to hear certain things. If they can't hear a certain thing on the stage, they'll want to listen to that. We actually go around making sure everything's working properly, so it's all blending, hopefully, together. Then we get the guys to actually make some noise... We can't bring a lot of our cases, trunks and things, so all the guitars, keyboards, have to travel separately. I had to clear out a third of my work box to make space for other people and to get the weight down. I think the best way to talk about things with Steve is there's very little to say, which is how he prefers it. I've been with him a long time. I pretty much anticipate what he might be wanting. He knows more about my gear than I do, and I'm lost without him. He also plays keyboards, as most people know. I don't actually consider myself to be a keyboard player as such, but I can do the stuff that Maiden requires, and some of it's not simple. Here's Janick's rig. Got all sorts of things in there. You got wireless, he uses wireless on a couple of songs, songs like Iron Maiden, he likes to swing a guitar about his head. This is a Pete Cornish unit, it's got pedals built into it, and I control the pedals from here. Justin Garrick, the man who looks after all my gear, does a fantastic job. He presses all the buttons for me, gets all the things together, and he fixes the guitars, fixes the amps, there's a lot of fixing to be done. We bring spares for everything. I've changed a pickup on this tour, volume pots, things like this go when you spin them around, throw them, sweat gets in them. All these things get changed out, so we have spares. It's not a daily thing, but it's things that may happen once on a tour. He's a very competent guy. Not only that, he's worked with Ronnie Wood, he's worked with Razorlight. He's a tremendous asset to Iron Maiden, and I'm really thankful we found him. My name's Sean Brady and I'm Adrian Smith's butler! I rely on Sean a lot, because my set-up is not very high-tech. Didn't you store it already? If I'm taking a solo, for example, Sean usually punches my effects in. There's also a question of, you know, the less wiring you have on stage, the better the sound. It's a 100-watt amplifier, of course, not a 50, not even 101. We don't go to 11 here, as you can see, we only go to 10. We've looked into 11, but it has been patented by a certain other English rock act. Yeah, Sean puts up with my moods now and again, you know, when things aren't going well, and calms me down a bit. We have a good rapport. We have masses of gear. You never know what you'll need. But we work it out down to the nearest amount of strings we're going to need. Colin, my guitar tech, has been absolutely tremendous. He's been with me now for a few years, and we have a great working relationship. He always kind of knows what sound I'm looking for. Everybody keeps coming along and making notes of all these dials to get that perfect Davie tone, and I just keep doing that, cos none of them work! We're out there to do a job and to play, but at the same time we have a laugh. The difference is, I have six flight cases, when we do a normal tour with trucks in Europe and America. On this, I think it's 26 pieces. Charlie's been with me now for, I can't remember, eight years, maybe nine, he's a fantastic drum tech. He's the only drum tech I've ever had that I allow to tune my drums for me. I showed him how I tune them and tone-wise, the difference between each drum. The tuning's gotta be bang on. When you've got nine toms, I feel it's quite difficult. And the cymbals, just the angles of everything, he notices everything. He'll sit there sometimes and just close his eyes and do this with the stick. And straightaway, you're talking a couple of millimetres... But it really is very essential, it's like a precision instrument, my drum Kit. If one part of it's out, the whole thing's completely... I'll sit there and if one thing is out on this side of the drum, by the time you get up here, it's way out of position, but Charlie is very good. Oh, yeah! Fucking great audience. Phenomenal! This is for the people in Japan tonight. We're in Monterrey, Mexico, it's really early o'clock in the morning. We were out of bed at 4:00, 3:30, after a great show last night. By the time we've loaded and got to bed, it was 1:00 in the morning, so do the math, it's about three hours sleep for some, who are lucky. It's tough because you're doing lots of flights and the crew sleep less than probably we do, but they're just trying to cram in a bit of sleep here and there. You find guys lying across flight cases and things like that, trying to grab a few hours sleep, because it's quite tough on them. I'm just collecting the washing that I don't want to put in the dryer. Just stuff that's air dried. That's still a bit wet, and of course, my washing, obviously. I just basically look after the band as in stage-clothes-wise, but if they ever need anything, I'm the one to fetch things they need. I describe this job as balancing six plates. This is my wardrobe room today. A bit dark... and a bit messy. I go in the day before to allocate the rooms, talk to the necessary people about what furniture goes in which room, talk to the caterers doing the riders for the band lounge, to give them a headstart as well, so when I do come in the morning, everything's ready. Usually I'll have the worry of how to get the washing done, so I don't want to waste time. This is the lounge area. They've done a pretty good job today. It's always different, every show. Sometimes I have to hound them. But today I didn't have to, just went through the rider with them, they were clear on everything. These are the drum heads, so I have a stash and put out three every show, for Nicko to sign so they can throw them out at the end of the show. We arrived here yesterday, arrived late last night from Lima, Peru, on Ed Force One. Came in early this morning. We've got gear coming from all over. The Big Eddie's coming on the sea container from the UK, we had towers that we flew air freight over from Australia, we have the goat that's back out, and we have other bits and pieces. So it's a full production Maiden show, hence the extra day. We also have our moving motors, which is... We have parts of the lighting rig move, to give it that spaceship effect. We don't have the luxury of using that everywhere we go, basically because the technology that you need to use it is not available everywhere. You just can't get it, and it's quite costly to fly it around, but we do have it for these big shows. We've been going through this tour with a basic set and six drapes, but there's four shows here, São Paulo, Rio, Chile and Argentina, which we'll put a full show in, which includes two other drapes. We've got the devil goat and of course the Big Eddie at the back. Big Eddie is in those two carts. Big Eddie is a one-off bespoke great big fibreglass and metal structure. It comes in the two biggest boxes you've ever seen in your life. Big Eddie was something that came from a similar idea that we had when we did Fear Of The Dark. Go away, I'm lagged to hell. I saw it by the sound desk, and I think it looks better there than close up, cos I'm looking at it from close up. It's great! Isn't it? It looks great when it goes down at the end. I think the effect from out front, especially further back, it looks huge. It's a weird effect, because you'd think it'd look bigger when you're closer up, but when you're further back, you get the whole vibe of it. It just makes the stage look really 3-D and I think it works really well. Iron Maiden's going to get all of you! Thank you! Good night from Iron Maiden! From the boys! We're going to places that, on a normal routine tour, you would never ever go to, you'd fly over. And so we find ourselves in places like Belem in North Brazil, just on the edge of the rainforest, and my goodness, did it rain! They don't call it the rainforest for nothing, I suppose. This is the second day of torrential rain we've had. Pretty typical for this area. Although a little stronger than normal, we've been told. It builds up, all the heat comes out of the jungle, moisture goes into the air, and then about 2:30 in the afternoon, it all falls out again. And today it's falling on top of us. So, anyway, loads of plastic, loads of sweeping, trying to keep the equipment dry, lots of mosquitoes, dengue fever, torrential rains. So, yeah, definitely beats a 9 to 5 job, I can tell you that much. It's an Amazonian Eddie. We're about three and a half hours away from doors, and...there's some more thunder. It'll be another great show tonight, it's going to be packed out, real excited Brazilian fans have not seen Maiden yet in this area. In fact, very few bands have actually been up this way, so that adds some extra excitement for some lifelong Maiden fans, they'll see them for the first time, up here in the Amazon Basin, in the jungles of Brazil. Somebody, who will remain nameless, decided to film a new DVD in Santiago and Buenos Aires, due to the fact of the good crowd reactions and such. All the logistics were put together months and months before, sea-containing out the Big Eddie, air-freighting in the towers, extra drapes. We did 'Rock in Rio', but it just seemed the turn to go further south. It was a long way to go down to Buenos Aires and Santiago, but the audiences are equally wonderful. It's a big endeavour, shooting a DVD. Logistically, it makes it more complex, there's more people out there, more mouths to feed, more cameras in the audience, a lot more dealings with local authorities and approvals, but it's all in a day's work, you know. We plan accordingly and stay ahead of the game, make sure it's smooth and comes off the way we want it to on the day. Six o'clock in the morning we got up. As you can see, it's still dark, looks more like the end of a load out than a load in. Yeah, early start today, a big, big show. The crew's been at it all night, moved down here yesterday. Yeah, this is Chile's national stadium. They were going to pull it down, but they decided to keep it as a monument, a monument to all the people that were killed in here by Pinochet. This is one of the places where he executed thousands of people. They reckon up to 100,000 people were killed during his dictatorship, that's not that long ago, 1973. But we're here for something a bit more lively. It can be quite distracting when you've got 20 or 30 cameras. Every note, every move you make, is being recorded, but you just gotta try and forget about it. We recorded 47 channels of audio. Each guitar has two mikes on each cabinet. There's 16 mikes on the drums, keyboards, and again, lots of audience vocals, all added up to 47. Because there's limited space on the plane, we have quite a small and compact and sophisticated recording system, which takes feeds from the front desk and we record everything digitally. We have seven or eleven different microphones to capture the audience. The audience is an integral part of the Maiden experience. The audience is something else. They sing every song, every lyric, it's something to see. The Santiago crowd was particularly animated. 60,000 people. I don't think there was anyone that wasn't singing along. Sing it! It was unbelievable tonight, the crowd here was 60,000 people, this is something special. I thought Buenos Aires would be something to beat, but tonight was absolutely incredible. I think we had a tremendous night. I think the band played really good. I came off both those shows and I felt good about it myself. It's nice to have a memento, that was us at this time, that was me at this time. Lucky enough this time, we've got two shows to choose from, and we'll use stuff from both shows, I'm sure. I mean, the audience were fantastic both nights, they're two of the best audiences in the world, without a doubt, which is why we wanted to do them there. We're about to launch off from a murky Chile towards Puerto Rico. Out of here it's 7 hours and 16 minutes of flight plan going to Chile, going over the Andes pretty much straightaway. The speed of the beast. Because of the size of the Iron Maiden shows, screens are a really important part of the production. We use a total of eight cameras, four main cameras looking at all the band members, which you have to direct and cue. Finishing on four. We carry three mini cameras of our own which go on Nicko. There is one other camera, which of course Eddie has, which gives us a good show to the screens. Do you know the band very well? If you know the band by name, it makes life easy for me, but if not, we can do it by a number system. One, two, three, four, five, across stage. This one, you don't have to worry about, because we have our own cameras. Do you need to translate or...? We're here in Puerto Rico, three shows from the end. We've had some interesting challenges along the way with language barriers. With a lot of these countries, you get what you're given. Some of the kit I've seen has been hysterical, it's like early '80s! So you do have to take the rough with the smooth. This has been slightly easier here in Puerto Rico, it's been a very good meeting. We have had pretty interesting ones in South America, but this is a good one, and I've got a good feeling about the show tonight. So two shows in Florida was great, and to finish up in Tampa, we haven't been for 20 years or so, it capped off the tour well. I think at the end, for everyone it was pretty well about time to go home. Back in America. We've been through Chile again which was a fantastic gig. We've done Puerto Rico and now we're in Florida doing the last two gigs, and it's been an absolutely fantastic tour. It's not been the longest tour by any means, but for some strange reason, doing it on Ed Force One magnifies everything. You're in a fishbowl. You spend time with everybody every day for months on end when you're on tour. From time zone to time zone, different languages, different cultures, every day the equipment's different, and we're all trying to make the show look and sound the same. It's been ten weeks, and then we get a few weeks' rest, and then do it all again in Europe. I'm surprised, it seems to have flown. No pun intended there. Australia was a bit tough, it was like gig, fly, gig, there was just no sleep, no rest. I had chest infections and colds most of the time, but, having said that, it's been great. It's been great, it's been really good, spirits have been high, I think the band's enjoyed it as well. All in all, I've had a blast. We're still standing, you know, I might've aged a little bit, might be a few chinks in the armour. Every night has been absolutely tremendous, you know, and it is hard to determine if one night was better than another, because they all were great. Apart from leaking rooms and getting in late to some places, the way we look at it, it's just that every show happened, nothing broke, we had no real disasters, so that's a success really. At the end of the day, that's all you can hope for, doing the job. We've been out for nine and a half weeks. It's been a pretty exciting challenge to be honest, especially throwing in a big DVD shoot in the middle in Argentina and Chile. With all the pre-work, the money, the agreements, the hotels being provided, which hotels, when can you land, when can't you, there's all that pre-work, but to actually make the tour work, it's the crew who make it work. On this particular tour, as we've been travelling together on Ed Force One, with 50-odd crew guys and the band all travelling on a plane, there's a real thing where everyone kinda bonds more. We've got a fantastic crew, and they all know what's needed, they all try their hardest to get the show looking the best it can be, and that's all you can ask of anybody, really. We're all mates, we all watch each other's backs in difficult situations. That's part of what it takes to be in a killer crew, I'm sure. It's what makes us the best. We're all loyal to Maiden, because they are to us. It really is like one big family. I wouldn't say one big happy family all the time. There we go, this'll learn you! To put that amount of people together is quite a contrived scenario, but, when you think about it, it's like any other regular family, but we're not related. We're related through rock 'n' roll. It's been a great tour. We've done a lot of miles, time for a break, recharge the batteries, get home and put a few shelves up, bit of painting and decorating. The concerts were pretty well all very enjoyable. That's the main thing for the guys, they love playing. They're there to do the concerts, but I think, as well, we had time off in some beautiful places, some new places, some interesting places. It's the longest we've ever done actually. It felt like a really, really long time to be away, considering the first one was not much more than six weeks, it's an extra three weeks. It's equivalent to 50,000 miles, we've been round the planet twice in a couple of months. We obviously spent a lot of it in South America. Whenever you go back, although we've been to a lot of these places before, it always feels new, especially the audiences as well, they seem to be getting younger. Nothing's perfect in this world, and we try to be the best we can be, but at the end of the day, we've gone out there and done the best we can in the given circumstances with quite a lot against us on this tour, and I think we've, you know, come out well. It's been gruelling. We started in Russia, we've been to Australia, we did Japan. We started off at minus 35, and I think we're in the 90s now, so we've done that whole temperature change thing, so it's been a fantastic tour. I'd just like to say thank you all for coming to the gigs. I gotta say, "Hats off." If I had a hat on, I'd take it off to everybody behind the scenes, our management team, everybody that was involved with making it work, especially our killer crew because they worked over and above the call of duty. It was hard on us, so it's gotta have been at least three or four times harder for them. Thank you to all you fans, but primarily this thank you goes out to all the people that made that tour possible. We boldly went beyond the final frontier, space, and...live long and prosper. The things that you've got up against you with the plane, it was a fantastic way to travel, don't get me wrong, people go, "What's he talking about, in a private plane?" Well, yeah, on a private plane, but the distances are like ten hours of flight or whatever. We actually went through the dateline from Japan to Hawaii and Mexico, and we actually got there before we left, work that one out! I actually had two days' birthdays and who wants that at my age? Show me the way to go home I'm tired and I want to go to bed Yee-haw, we're heading home! See all them names on the side of the plane there? It doesn't say England on the bottom, but that's where we're going and that's where I'm looking forward to being. I'm coming home! Is this the bus home, ma'am? The bus home. The flying bus home. Yes, baby, yeah! Success, triumph, again. It's been an emotional rollercoaster ride. It's good to be going home. I'm going home, I've done my time I don't want to go, I'm not finished yet. That's it, it's all over.
