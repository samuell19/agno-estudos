“Never tell the truth to people who are not worthy of it.” Ok. Are you comfortable? Viktor, if you can tell us with your own words What really happened at Kolguskär? Just take it from the top. It all began so great… The team... The weather... The archipelago. We’re pulled towards the light. Like a moth. We wanted to make a film. That's our passion. And in the beginning it was really fun. The director wanted… He kind of wanted to blur the lines between what was reality and… Then it all happened so fast. Are we ready? Camera set? Then it was like the darkness fell. And action! Everything went to hell. To hell. You know what, guys? We need some drinks now, am I right? Does anyone volunteer? - Nina? - I can make some drinks. Wonderful, Nina, thanks! What would you like? Something really strong. Of course! And you? I'll have something really light. Skinny bitch? What did you say? What do want, honey? It doesn’t matter. Surprise me. What would you like? Something that isn't pink. What do you have against pink drinks, Maria? Don’t match my chakras. I think it would match my sex chakras really well, actually... - Okay. - Ship ahoy! Land in sight! Look at this! A pink drink as ordered! Here, which one do you want? Cheers, my friends! Cheers! Yep, it’s about time to reef the sails. Gustav, do you remember the rig setting? Yeah, uh, sure. Yes, okay, maybe? Yeah, we need to bring down the cutter and then the mainsail. Is this your work? Have a seat. Yes off course. Should we stand and make a little toast? This is really nice Maybe a song? Let's sing... “The whole goes down. Sing “hopp fad- de- ralllan la lan lay" Great! Lovely! A drink? A little a shot! Let's hear the story that Nina has. Why we ended up here? - Nina, Nina, truthfully, you have to tell us. Why are we here right now? I chose this lighthouse because there were two lovers who... They... She was expecting a child... And they... They settled here on the island, and were going to raise their child here on the island. And... Fill it up a little. Don't be shy now. Suddenly one day she was gone. No one knows what happened to her. They think she might have drowned or... Or something. She was just gone and he couldn't find her. So… They say he comes here every year to look for her, still. Well ok! But that was a real sad story! Can’t we just have another toast and talk about something more cheerful? Right, baby? But that was really nice! This is just wonderful, cheers to that! Yeah, let’s just lift the mood a little... - That was a good story. - Should we toast? Yes, very nice. Nice story. Thank you for sharing it with us. Cheers! You definitely need to drink up all of that. Mmm, bottoms up! Me too! But we have something nice to tell as well, don’t we? - We have a story too. - What could that be then? It’s about the Draugadrotten and she - was, like, this woman - An island. - Draugadotten is an island. - A woman on an island. Why don’t you tell it then? You can start. And I can fill in later. The island is called Draugadrotten. That’s what I said... The island's Draugadrotten, exciting. Okay! And on this island... There lived a woman... And this woman, she lit fires on the island. To lure sailors.. They ran aground. If they didn’t die when they ran aground, she’d murder them when they swam ashore. And if they were too many... She'd turn them against each other. This is my favourite part. And how did she do that? - Lust. - Yeah. that's it. - With what? - With lust. You do know what lust is, Gustav? Yes, I know what it is. But she died herself. Mhm, what happened was she got burned. She accidentally set herself on fire. One of those fires she'd lit. No. Because girls don’t set themselves on fire. Only men do that. But she died. The circumstances are unclear but she died. And then there was a Mare. Or a restless spirit. That still lies over the island. That haunts the island. And that’s what makes it so exciting! So I was thinking... That we could go to this island and try to speak with this spirit. To try to reconcile the world with - So we're doing some witch dance then? Baby, please. Gonna dance a witch dance! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, baby. There are no ghosts. Honey, it’s not a ghost! If you believe in things in these days with all the science that exists, then you’re a fundamentalist in one way or another. Right?! You’re a fundamentalist. "And you're a fundamentalist!" I mean, you're a fundamentalist. So like, are you going to say that about everything then? - I don't know but - You know you feel better with yoga, don't you? Is yoga fundamentalism too then? Mhm, you're a little fundamentalist. Let’s have a little toast to that, come on! Yup, okay. “The Mare goes down, sing "hopp fade- rallan la lan lay" Come on, fill it up now! I want a “Sonny” glass now. No socialist glass. - There you go! - There! Okay… Let’s see now… I think we’re about here right now. And.. So, we’re going all the way over here. Draugadrotten. So it’s a looooong journey ahead. “Long Day’s Journey Into Night”. Eugene O’Neill. Oh, look at that. So cultural…. But.. Speaking about long... Have you heard the legend about The Flying Dutchman? Flying Dutchman? Ah, right... How did that story go? Go! The short or the long version? No, do the short one! Okay, hehe. The short. Willem Van Der Decken had decided to sail around the Cape of Good Hope, whatever the cost. He went and failed several times until he swore that neither God nor the devil would stand in his way. God didn’t like that. So God put a curse on him. Condemning him to, until Doomsday, sail the seas of the world. As a ghost, that is. A ghost ship. What a bloody idiot! Did he believe that himself? The only ghost on his ghost ship were the ghosts in his own damned head. You get me? - This is what fundamentalism is. - Hehe, yeah. It’s the same with all fundamentalists who believe in something so fucking much it becomes reality. If there’s an old man on a cloud or if it’s a utopian political idea that they have in their head… It’s madness. The interesting part is what you can do with faith. If you were to sit and try to levitate for 20 years, would you be able to levitate after 20 years? Faith can move mountains… But… What do you believe in? Alcohol. Tits. Brotherhood. I believe we’re going to have a fucking good time! And now we’re going to, aren't we? For what you believe… Becomes reality. Exactly! You’re a crazy mother fucker. Do you remember this then? - “You, beautiful bride” - Yes, I was the one. “Your white wedding suit with curls.. Oh gentle sea, a ship ...” What are you doing? - Eh, nothing? - Okay. You’re not coming up then? It’s, like, a mad sunset up there! - It’s really cozy up there. - I don't know. It's so cold. Come on now! Put a jacket on. I mean… We have talked about this. Can you at least try? Huh? Good. Come! Look! Well well… You’re not too shabby after all. I’ll take it to the computer and you'll see what I can do with this... Hey, you know what I was thinking? No? That next time we go somewhere we could do it just you and I. Alone. What do you think? Mm, we can do that. I love you. - I love you too. - Oookay. - Maestro! One for the road's coming up. Welcome! Thank you kindly. Sit, sit, and have a look! - My, oh my! - I know, right? - Now fill it up! - Two shots coming up! Two shots. Better than two fundamentalists! Sonny, come over here! Baby, it looks so nice from here. Just turn around againt! Cheers! We should lock them into a room together. With a bottle of booze. All the fundamentalists! Oh, yeah... Then we'd get to the truth, am I right? They'll get completely sloshed. They'd figure out the truth! - That's a great idea! - Yeah! If only... life could be like this always. Are you kidding me? Why? Did you become religious all of a sudden? Maestro?! What? Really? Are you going to have a sex cult? - I'll join straight away! - Yeah, maybe... It's the best thing I've ever heard! Hehe, yeah... You'll be my guru. Yeah... Cool down man. Let's finish this one! You'd better finish that before you head down to the lady. Yeah. I'd better check on her. I think she's resting a bit. Say hi to the missus. Thanks for everything. The way we're working on this production with a lot of improvisation, I have done that a bit before and I think it's really fun to get to work in this fashion. Eh… And then there's an incredible amount of parts from the script that are kept from us, which adds a tension to it all the time. You're never sure what your character will have to go through. And you're completely free and dynamic. And can truly create your characters yourselves. So that's amazing. It's really fun to not know the end while you're acting, and instead you live in the present, just like the character. I really enjoy playing an part. When I get to be in the present, in the moment and just focus on what's happening right now. That suits me perfectly. I do love improvisation, so I find that super fun. And as long as everyone has their own character and know what the relationships are between them I just think it's exciting. And it gives a little more life to the scenes and you can play around with everything that's going on. I had never worked like that before. The director held us in a chaotic, but pleasant, grip somehow. We trusted him, fully. Scene after scene. It was like a surprise every day. Every scene. It was awesome. At the same time, we knew it was a dark movie we were making. You could feel it. It feels like.. It feels like.. But I can't! I just can't! Fuck... I have to... Fuck! You don't belong here. Nightmares again? Mmm... I love you. I love you. Good morning! Good morning. Want to tag along for some yoga? Nah. I’m good, thanks! Are you a little scared of trying new things? No. Let’s go for a walk then? The others are sleeping anyways. Okay. Okay! Just gonna change first. - Gonna show you something. - Mhm? - You see this? - Mhm? It's magical place, you can't walk in! It's holy! It's holy ground. Wanted to show you because it's a holy place. You see? Like a labyrinth. Mhm… Looks like a bunch of rocks to me. You have to walk there. Okay... It's made for rituals. Like sacrifices. Love. You walk it from the beginning to the end. It feels like there is something on this place. Maybe it sounds stupid? I feel something here. What was that about a mare you talked about? Oh, it’s her spirit that remains. Haunting people and protecting the treasures. Why? When I was little I sometimes felt like this. But… They said it wasn’t right. They... Did things and said something was wrong with me. When people say there's something wrong with you, it's usually THEY who have a problem. When I was little there was a boy in my class who said there was something wrong with me. So I bashed in his face. And then I set his cat on fire. You know, we've gotten 5 stars 5 years in row, so... We're doing really well with the lighthouse safari. - Huh. - Hi, Erik. - Hi, Nina. How was the herring lunch? Oh, it was very nice. Thank you so much. Really nice. But she's worrying a bit about the Mara on the island. Oh yes, the Mara. Hmm. There's been a fair share of accidents on this island, if you know what I mean. How so? Yes, it's said that there was a woman, once upon a time, who led people astray. So they ran aground and then, when they did, she'd kill them. But that's just superstition. And I happen to be a hunter as well, so... so if you would need any help I've shot a whole lot of birds on this island so you can be sure I can shoot a ghost too. Yup. But she's taken so, if you could just show us the dinner location instead? Huh. Where is everyone? Uh, Nina went back to the boat. The lighthouse keeper went to fetch the crayfish, I think. And you know about the others. What? Yeah. Thérèse and Gustav, you do know? Huh… I guess one has to be generous… Give and take. You’re good at that. Did you see something? Okay, let’s go. Are you ready? These are nice. This collection. - It looks nice. - Mhmm. - Yeah, let’s start here. - No. - No, wait, let's do over here. - Here? There. I want that background. Yeah, that's good. Move a little. No, I don't want those glasses. Take them off? So he’s at it again? I thought we’d get some time off this weekend, but I guess not? How are things, really? She seems a little… Fragile. For the most part it’s good but sometimes I just don't recognize her. Like she's got two personalities of some kind. Wow. Scary. But it’s nothing serious or anything. No, I mean, it seems like you're doing really great. I'm just kidding. It was a joke. These are cool! Very “sailor”. "Sailor" I like them. Start. Stand there again. I’m doing some closeups. No,! No, no, no... Give them to me. Oops. Should I sit here? No, you should stand! Okay. Here? Here? Here? What the... What the hell is he doing? Hey.. I’m sorry, I… That was a bit over the top. I didn’t mean to- Sonny, what was that about? What’s going on? Had a swim. You know she’s pretty sensitive, don't you? You need to toughen her up a bit! You’re too cowardly. Not everyone finds that funny, you know. It was just a little dip. You’re a little curling boyfriend, aren’t you, huh? Sonny wait up, I need to talk to you. Sonny! Hey, how are you? I’m fine. Sure? I’m going ashore for a walk. Should I come with you? No... That’s fine, I want to be on my own.. Okay. It’s alright. I understand you, Gustav. There you are. Or? What’s wrong? Come here. Huh? Are you okay? I’m good. Should I be here? - Nope, that didn't fly. - Nope. Of course. Now, now. Are you okay? You felt something, right? You've got to tell us! What is this place? Does it have something to do with this Mara, or what? No, I've never been here. But... I guess it's a common... It's something, I guess. BUT, speaking of this “Mara” we talked about, well... I can tell you she got away pretty easy if she was, indeed, you know incinerated herself or was burnt at the stake. Okay! Can we... Just keep such negative things outside? This is a holy place! Come, let’s go out. - Outside the circle, please. - Yeah. - Tell me. - The short or long version? Come on! The short. Okay! But was she burnt here, or what? Well. I don't know, but they say she was. And... But I can tell you... I've read a bit about crime and punishment in those days Yeah? and as late as the 1730's it was written in the law that a person who hurts and kills someone who's... been shipwrecked shall be racked, and then strung up on the wheel. Nina, it's better if you walk it from the beginning to the end. There is no beginning or end. Racked? What’s that? A person sentenced to be racked gets all the bones in their body crushed, one by one, while they're still alive. Hello there! What the hell are you doing? This is a military exercise area, you hear me? What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! It’s forbidden to come ashore here. Hi! Ove. Are you the one in charge here? Uh... Yes. We’re just filming a little bit. You can't just fucking come here and start filming! Are those boats over there yours? It's forbidden to come ashore. But, uh, we have, uh, we have the… You don’t have permission to be here! You can’t come ashore! The amphibious regiment is coming any minute with their battle ships. - Okay? - What the hell... Come with me. And you're not filming anymore! We have people here and... Hey! All boats anchor... ... out there. They DON'T come ashore. There's a reason for that. He can't say that. Can't we finish up shooting? This shouldn’t be happening here! It’s not that kind of island. Okay? You have 45 minutes to pack... and then fuck off. Can we have 1 and half hours, or something? NO! FUCK! There'll be boats. - It's not okay! - Can't we talk about it? Solve it somehow? Solve it? We have a bloody schedule... This will not do. If we just... Okay, let’s say 45 minutes, we'll pack up and see how things are then? Does that work? 45 minutes and then everything needs to be gone. All your shit! Everything! What's the production company? Tribespider… You quit filming now, or I'll smash the whole fucking camera. Yeah, but... You can take it down a notch? You CAN be nice, this was a mistake. We didn't have a clue- There's a number of signs here and they who own the boats, it's their responsibility to know exactly where they can dock or not. Maybe you didn’t know, that’s fine. But if someone is in charge here... It's not okay! No, I hear what you're saying. But I just want you to know that, I don't think many people know about this, and we definitely didn't know. So we’re not here to cause any trouble, and we're going to- I’m getting really fucking irritated. It’s him I’m talking to him and not you. If you have a problem I suggest you “fuck off”. - Okay... - Can we get your name too? - We want to know whom we’re talking to - That’s none of your business. It doesn’t matter. I’m here on the military’s behalf. - So it doesn’t matter. - Frogs, you said? Frogs? Yeah right. Okey, we... We'll pack up! It's cool. We'll fix this. It's cool. I'll be back in 40 minutes now. Okay. Everything needs to be gone! Okay. Okay! Uh, okay. I have a plan. Take it easy, now. Take it easy... - I’m furious… - Me too. Listen up! 45 minuter. That’s not going to happen. Let’s play it cool and just nail this scene. I think the smart thing would be to try to finish it as soon as possible. Yes! But when they come, it will be another guy. This guy has his hands full. I say we go for it! - I don't know... - Or? - I just think… - What do we really have left to do? I think it would be smart to try to finish up what we need in this scene. And then try to get rid of everything. Right! Right! If we want the opportunity to come back here another day... And try to lead the scene to a different location. Exactly. - Yeah, let's do what we need to - And we'll figure the rest out later. What exactly is it you need for the scene? What's the shot you need? - Maria, Sonny. - And? We have a two- camera set, the rest we’ll sort out. - We have most of the other stuff. - We need a master too. We need a master too? That's right!- The last thing we shoot. So let's hurry then. We have to do that in 10 minutes. We do two- camera now, and then a master! Yup, okay. Focus! Take a breath everybody! Deep breath everybody! - Deep breath! - Are we really going from the top? Let go of irritation… We’re doing a two- camera set! Is the sound recording? Yes, I'm ready! - Sound ready? - Yes! - Slate 103, take 2. - Set! ...hurts and kills someone who's... been shipwrecked shall be racked and then strung up on the wheel. Racked? What's that? That's when the sentenced gets all the bones in his body crushed, usually by the Breaking Wheel while he's still alive. Honey! Did you hear that? That's exactly what the Tax Agency does to me every year! A Breaking wheel is when it's not enough of a punishment to break all the bones, and they thought" let's humiliate a little extra" they'd cut up the corpse, often into 4 pieces string it up on a pole and a wheel on top, and then you attach the body, often you'd fasten the head to the- I don't think we should talk any more about the dead. I totally agree with Nina! I did tell you this was a place of love! Honey, you're quite right. This is a place of love! It's a giant vagina! Just look at this! Honey... No. This is a place for sacrifices. You can use it for sacrifices even today, You can find volunteers to sacrifice on the internet. Maybe you should try? I’m heading to the boat! Uploading some pics. And that woman is on my payroll… I’m gonna go change… Do you want me to come along? No. Gustav. I say we forget about this mumbo jumbo and go racke a crayfish And then we’ll string up some schnaps by the wheel! Honey! I told you to be careful! God! Cut! Something’s not right. He didn’t wear a uniform, he didn’t have anything. He’s faking it. I don’t think we can count on that. I'm sorry, but I have to be honest. I don't think we can count on that. He will be back. But he would have shown.. It’s something else. I don’t care what it is! Something’s not wright. He’s faking it. We have Freedom to Roam, don't we? But we have to pack up and leave, we can't- I think it's a scam, I think they're bluffing. But he's a soldier! He's a super soldier! It's not a sham, I promise you it's not a sham! We’ll take 20 minutes! Ove, can I say something? Can’t we just do the master first in case everything goes to shit? We’ll do the master first. Play it cool now, and we'll do the master. - I swear, I have a feeling it’s not right… - But if you’re wrong, then we won't be able to come back?! He had nothing, nothing! It’s a classic, he’s turning it… No, I don't buy it! But it's an exercise, they don't need it for exercises. - Right? - No… He’s like a super soldier. - Something’s not right! No but it doesn't matter. Let's do the master! If everything goes to hell we'll at least have the scene. But why would he... Make it up? No he wouldn’t make it up. Some of us thought it was strange. I mean, we do have the Freedom to Roam. The director was convinced it was a ruse. So he wanted to continue. And in a way he was right. No military showed up. And it's a big project to... To rearrange a whole film crew and change location... There wouldn’t have been a movie then. So we pressed on even though the mood was... fairly tense. It became morning and we continued and it kinda.... Just kept going. But then there was the... The documentary photographer, Lukas, he.... he wanted to investigate it further, by himself. So he left with his camera. Hey! Tom, Simon! How did it go? Everything looks great, no problems. - Do you have any food? - Where's... Yeah, of course. - How was it? No children? - No. Excellent. Then we'll keep to the plan and just go ahead. Lukas was convinced they were doing something... illegal. First we just thought.... Well that he had a vivid imagination or he made it up. But he wanted me to look at this clip. He was like "You HAVE to see this" So I did. It was so weird. Just like insects… flying straight into a fire. It’s fucking weird. He went this way in any case. Okay. We didn't really know what the hell we were getting ourselves into. - Hey! - Hey! How did it go? I want to hear everything, guys. Come! How did it go? But he has something there! He’s holding something. He’s holding, like, a - What the hell? It looks like a hand, or something? It’s not a fucking hand! Of course that’s a hand. Don’t you see it’s hand? No, I don’t see that. Yes, it fucking is! Well, I can also see it’s a hand. But let’s do like this then, we’ll bet if it’s a hand or not. - Seeing as it's very - So what are you suggesting? Quite clearly, not a hand. Are you going to go there and ask if it’s a hand or not? What are you thinking? It was like that island had a life of its own. It’s strange but, it was like film and reality began to merge in a peculiar way. The mood got weirder and weirder and it's like what happened was that our characters began to affect reality. Or what the hell was even reality? So, I thought maybe you could take over the Lindqvist account, if you'd like to? I love this! I thought that was your favorite account? Swimming is life! You know, there just isn’t enough time. And you’ll get to choose models and stuff. - Mhm... - Sweet! It’s decided then! I've got some reconciliation gifts... Honey! - What is it? - It's time for gifts! - For me? - Yup! What are you up to now? Here... Does this work? Look at this. Looks like we had company. Booh! Or not. Man, I’m hungry. Maybe we should be nice to them. We can show them the place. We'll show them... It does smell like crayfish out here. So there’s a crayfish in this? Yeah, there is actually, you’re quite right. Did you put the crayfish in there? Ok then, who needs a drink? Yes, I need more, definitely. Nina! Welcome! - Welcome. - Hi! - We’ve waited so long for you now! I do apologise on behalf of my husband, he’s such a.. No, I’m going to apologise myself. Forgive me, Nina! It’s fine, really. I thought it was fun and it was … refreshing. Good! Okay! It’s all alright then? That's a champion right there! He does stuff like that. It’s not serious. He does it with all the models. At least you’re clean, and so am I. A pretty magical day, right? I went for a walk earlier today. I think I found the place where the lighthouse once was. How could you tell? It felt like the optimal place for a lighthouse. On top of a mountain, high up with a view to all directions. I had some kind of experience there. Energies? So we’re back there then… The magical energies! It would be amazing if we could all go there together. Yes! That’s what we said in the beginning! And what would we even do there? Are we going to have a séance, or something? Of course we are! It’s a really beautiful place, I think you’d all like it. - Mmm, I know. - Welcome all of you, to this wonderful dinner. It’s about time to break some crayfish by the wheel! Cheers! Bitch! Hello? Hello? SOS, Mayday! Can anybody hear me? Hello?! SOS. Emergency. We're on Draugadrotten. Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me? SOS. Mayday!? Sonny’s already done that. Uh? What? Huh? - What do you - It doesn’t matter. - They’re all dead. - What? We looked for you. Are you going to kill me now too? No! I tried doing that! But that didn’t work, did it? I SAW! No… Yes, because you thought you were alone but you weren't! I saw! I saw you! You waited in the shadows like you always have. I felt it! I too could feel your presence! It wasn’t just “Nina”. I didn’t quite understand at first but... It was you controlling me. All the time. Everyone must swear that they’re in on this. I’m in. You’re in. Of course, honey. Let’s go then. Okay. Let’s open our hands... And take the hand of the one next to you. Ouch! No, but I felt something! I felt something for real! Baby, if we’re going to do this then it has to be for real. Sorry. I’m in. Okay. Close your eyes. I want everyone to take a deep breath in. And hold it.... And then when we let it go we’re letting go of all the doubt, all the prejudice on an “a”. "Aaaaa"... Good. Good.... Keep your eyes closed. I want you to think of someone you’ve lost, someone you’ve felt... An incredible love for. And with open hearts… And with an open mind… We welcome and summon you, Mara, to come back to us and tell your story! So that we can help you to reconcile with the universe! Everyone take a deep breath in! And out on an “o”! “Oooooo”... And just wait... It should work? It’s just… There has to be someone who's not believing. I believe. I believe… That maybe we just need to try something else? Something a little stronger? A tiny schnaps, perhaps? No! That's not what I had in mind. But maybe an incantation? I don’t think that belongs here. It does sound logical. We can give it a try. Well… Okay. You can lead one then, Maria. Good. Okay... - I’ll need you to be with me. - Mhmm. Repeat what I say... And only what I say. And then we say it in unison. Okay. Sator. Arepo. Tenet. Opera. Rotas. Together now. ...Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas... - Nina! - Fuck! Ow! Nina! Nina, wait! What have we done? What the f… What a drama queen! Screw this. Time for a drink. A big fucking drink. Cut! Got it. Clapperboard! The other way. Upside down? - Nice! Good job. What the hell is going on? It's the pilot. Let’s talk to them. Let’s... Take a break till their gone It’s insane. - Yeah. - Do you take this? - Hello there! - Hi! What is that lamp you have there? It’s a LED lamp. We’re shooting a film. Alright. Well, we received an interrupted emergency call. Have you seen any... Anything strange? Something… out of the ordinary? No? We’re just doing the film here. Okay, okay… Well, let us know if you see anything? Sure thing! I've got the VHF... I'll let you know if I see anything. Good, good... What kind of film are you making? It’ll be something with death and pain. Okay, Alright. Good luck with that, you guys! - Yes! - Take it easy! - Take care! - Bye! What was that all about? Let's back to work now. - Now look at that. - Yeah But I want to have a look first… Can I get a playback on this? You'll take the mic? Yup. - Good job! - Same! Nice. Hey man… Should we check it out? Or no? The idiot? I think so. I think we should. What are you talking about? I’m saying that... Maybe we should... Check out that idi... I mean the soldier guy. Is that so smart? But... Wait a minute! Let's whait with the documentary part right now, or what are you doing? We have a film to make, okay? Focus! - Do the documentary later. - Sure. Sometimes I wonder if people can be aware of their destiny. If there are people who can see further ahead. Into the future. And see when… When it’s over…. You’re not getting it, are you? What? Huh? I don’t understand... It all happened so fast. I... I ended up somewhere else. I wanted to escape but... ..."Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas"... It wasn't like that! That’s not what happened, I saw you! And you went here and killed... You killed Sonny! It.. Was?... You? We... We opened… We opened the door together. And she came out. And took us! But I... I managed to escape. I ran but she was everywhere! The Mara, she, she hunted me. Everything was spinning... I came to the boat but no one was there. It felt like she was stalking me. Deceiving me... She was waiting! I couldn’t take it anymore! I needed help! But Sonny, he… He was already dead. The Mara had taken him. Where are the others? That’s NOT what happened! You thought you were alone. - But I saw you. - What? - No? - I SAW! I saw you! RUN! Sonny! Stop! - Okay, it’s time. - Yep. They won't notice we're leaving? Let’s go. A quick one. I'll tell you when they start... I'm bringing the phone. So we can film with it. - Hey! - Hey, there! - Are you red or what? - Yeah, a little. - All good? - Yeah? Are they still at it? Yup! They’re going to do scenes with... I don't remember his name? Okay, are you in? We're leaving now? Oh, right now? Would prefer to wash up a little and change. We should do it now before they wrap up filming. So... Are you in or out? I’m in. - Let’s do this. - Let's go. - Do you have your mobile? - Yeah. Good. - I'll film it. - Okay, okay... Careful, careful! Sneak. I’ll be quiet. - Shut up. - Okay. We’ll stand still. Film it! Get it on film. Okay… No one there... Okay... What the hell is happening? Oh shit! He's coming... Schhh! Come! Bloody hell! Shit! Okay… Okay… Okay... - Shit... - What the hell?! Who the hell are you? You’re coming with me. I’ll break your fucking wrist! Ow! I’m just here filming- Shut the hell up. We're practicing for a film shoot! She’s from the film team I told you about. Let’s go in here. - No, I don’t want to! - On your knees! No, I’m not going to! Get in! What the fuck, they can’t do this! I’m going to the tent! You were supposed to piss off 6 hours ago! What the hell are you doing here? Is there anyone else here but you? - Stay! - I’m going! Pistols! Did you see? For fuck’s sake, come back! If you don’t tell the truth now I’ll bash your face in, do you understand? It IS the truth! I’m telling you, it’s the truth! It’s a film shoot, okay? - Where are the others? - You're full of shit What the hell are you doing here? What is it you have seen here? I’ve seen nothing! What are you even doing here? That's none of your business. This is a military exercise, - just like I’ve said before. - Okay! But why are there only three of you? Hey, what’s going on here? What the hell! Run! Run! - Damn! - Well, that was smart. She was full of shit anyway. Yes, but it's easier to interrogate someone who’s awake? Fucking shit! What the hell, it’s recording! Shit! Hey guys, take the boat! I know where they are, down by the beach. Go around the cape. Let's meet there!. What the hell is happening?! Wait, wait, wait! What the fuck! Okay, I’m calling. 911... Okay... Hello! I'm on the island Draugadrotten. It’s just… My friend has just been shot! You have to get here! Draugadrotten! Shit, they’re coming! Come on! Run! We have to warn the others! SONNY! Stop! Stop it. I saw you killing them all. You're possessed by the Mara. You’re not getting it, are you?! Nina is no more. You're possessed by the Mara. Wait, wait! There’s a bloody boat here now. What? Are we cutting? Yes, we’ll have to cut. Wait. Think about it... You have no weapons! All you have is a camera. What were we supposed to do? Are you filming? You shut the fuck up! Run! Run! Run! We've got to save Malin! Come on now! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I don’t understand why? It was like they were going to kill everyone. Come here quick damnit! They’re still on the island. What? What? [LUKAS:] - What are they saying? They control the phone! What the fuck! I had to do something. I could at least still, maybe save Malin. If she was alive. They found Lukas. And the camera. There were definitely more of you when we met the first time. What do you want to know?! Ten, fifteen? We’ve already cleaned house. It’s just you here, you see. And whomever might be left, - we’ll take care of as well. - What the? Is that camera still rolling? Let's keep it rolling. It doesn’t matter. - Take the foot. - NO! No, no! But it was too late. And there were more cameras. And phones sometimes work better than you might think. Police! Lie down! - Carlsson! You secure. - I press on. … the object is secure. You can come in with the helicopter now. You there! Come here! It’s safe. It’s over. It’s strange… the power a camera can hold. We hope and believe it to tell the truth. But can we… be quite certain of that? Oh my God! What the hell is going on here? - Are you okay? - Yes... Yes, I’m okay. - Is it your blood? - No? No. It’s fine. Okay... I’ll call for help. Mayday! Mayday! It’s from Draugadrotten. Multiple casualties. And a critically wounded woman.
