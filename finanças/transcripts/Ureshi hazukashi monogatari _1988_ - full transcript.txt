A NIKKATSU PRESENTATION Produced by: Nikkatsu Why are you embarrassed? Why are you embarrassed? Aren't you happy that I'm here? I'm really happy, you know. But I'm just a bit embarrassed. I see. You're a shy one. What do you do here, Mister? It looks dead in this room. There's no TV nor a phone. It's going to get warm. Just another 10 minutes. I'm going home in 10 minutes. - Can I take my shoes off? - Yes. - You have beautiful legs. - Thank you. You have a family, right, Mister? Are things not going well with your family? - Things are well with my family. - Really now? I'm getting hot. I don't hold liquor well. Alcohol makes me loosen up. What is your name? Chako! Chako? Miss Chako, huh? Where do you live? I'm not telling you! But I'm so glad you came. You didn't think I'd come? No, I didn't think you'd come. You must be picking up girls all the time. It's my first time ever. I'm quite surprised myself. - I'll believe you. - Is that so? There's no bed. No towels. If you did it often, you'd have everything ready. This is a place just for me. No one has ever visited here. My family has never been here. You're the type who enjoys isolation, Mister. Well... I'm actually so lonely I don't want to be by myself, but I want to be alone. I guess that doesn't make sense. I had expectations for myself for this place. Like how would I utilize it. I like art, so I thought I might fill this place with art supplies. I thought maybe this place would be filled with masterpieces. But after two years, nothing has changed. And then I ended up in your space. Are you a student? I won't tell you that! Are you a model? Are you trying to flatter me? It's not flattery! But I'm so fat. It's better to be a bit chubby when you're young. You look healthier. So, you like healthy girls. I think I'll go now. I don't want to invade your space much. I see. You're going home? Can I come again? I may bring a gift next time. Like what? My youthfulness. Mister. Mister. I'm here again. I'm so glad you came! Did you think I'd come? I hoped you would. That's why I've been coming here every evening. Question! What am I wearing underneath? A white sweater. Bottom? A mini skirt? Look! A dress! I wore jeans during the day, so I went home and changed. - Why is that? - You like mini skirts, don't you? Well, yes. You're so honest. The thing that I think about the most when I'm here is not about my dream of the future. It's the dream of my past. That's dangerous, Mister. People think about the past when they don't have a future dream. That's true. There is no future for me. Even at the office, I'm just a manager. A manager? Wow, that's amazing! - Is that so? - It's amazing! You're important. My leg went numb. You should hit your heels. Can you do it for me? Stretch out your legs and move your legs. All right. One, two... One, two... You need some courage. Courage? Be honest. Like, "I want to sleep with a young girl if I could". You're thinking that, aren't you? Yes, but with whom? She's right here. You? But you're a regular girl, and... no, I can't... I'm too old. And it's always the girl that gets hurt. You're so old fashioned. Girls these days don't get hurt by such things. - Is that so? - Hey, Mister. Make me your lover, yes? A TALE OF HAPPINESS You're approved, Mister. Just on Fridays. I'll come over here once a week. Manager. What is it? What are you thinking about? You have a huge grin on your face. What is it? Kasumi, don't make me repeat myself. Clean up your own room. Yes. Hiroshi, where did you get this porn video? From Sakurai. Go give it back. You understand this is a crucial time for you, right? Your entrance exam is coming up. Hello? Missus... Do you know what I'm doing now? No, I don't! 200.000 yen is good. It's a bargain. Since I'm a virgin. 150.000? Are you negotiating? You're so middle age. About that video... - Are you listening? - Yes, I am. Can you please talk to Hiroshi? - About what? - See? You're not listening at all. It's about the video. What are you thinking about? About work, of course. You idiot. What are you mad about? Because you say stupid things. What's stupid? I've gotten Hiroshi a way into a high school. But he still needs to get a decent score on his entrance exam. He's just like you and so into girls. I'm not that way at all. I know even if you hide it. I bet you're into young office girls in mini skirts... Can I have some tea please? He gets upset as soon as he gets uncomfortable. Sorry, my legs are like daikon radishes. What are you talking about? That tickles, Mister! No, it tickles... Enough, now. That's it. Yes, you're starting to feel it. No, not at all. Don't say that. No, I don't feel good at all. Don't scare me like that! Am I a ghost? Honey. I have a lover. Wakako! Stop it, dear. We just did it two days ago. Honey, what's the matter? Why are you in such a hurry? I still haven't... Dear... Dear, I'm coming. Hurry up! Will you listen to anything I say? You come too. So, hurry up. Dear! Dear! Here you go! You're going to catch a cold! It's a beautiful day. All right, let's go! Here it comes! What are you thinking? Nothing good will come from having an affair. You quit school... You don't last three months when you work. And now a lover? School and work aren't meant for me. It's useless to do something that's not meant for me. I'm just telling you to have a real relationship. Ouch! - You should too, sister. - Watch your tone. Amamiya is a yakuza, right? Yakuza are real humans too. Is that so wrong? You actually hate him, right? But you can't break up with him. You can't separate yourself from him. What would a kid like you understand? A relationship between a man and a woman is a lot more complicated. I don't think it's complicated at all. I'm not asking for love. Just sex. - You're not a prostitute. - All women are prostitutes. They all get bought by men. Chako, since when do you have such sad thoughts? It's not sad at all. I just separated my heart from my body. Mister. Mister. Oh. What should we get? I don't understand the menu. - I don't belong here. - You're fine. We'll get this sour drink and I'll get the orange chestnut parfait. I'll get the same, then. - Are you really sure? - What about? To be with me? It's fine! Oh, your necktie. Let's take this. We'll do this. Here! And your collar. Give me your hand. Here, good! All right. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm going to take a bath. I have to be squeaky clean like a young lover should be. You put all the sofas together and make a bed. Well, I know this feels wrong, but here you have... Thank you. What's wrong, Mister? No... nothing! Oh, I see. You think of me as a prostitute. That's why you look like that. No, no. It's not that. Of course there should be money exchange. There's no way a young beautiful girl like you would befriend a middle aged guy like me. It may be sentimentalism. I'm from an old generation, so... How do I explain it? Like the heart... I like you, Mister. You like me? I like you a lot. Kiss me. Kiss me properly. I feel it. It's all right if you fall in love with me. You don't have to hold back. I'm not holding back. It's better that way. I just want you to feel something. Mister, you should practice kissing a little more. Do I suck? You don't suck, but young people get aroused with kissing. I don't do something like this without anyone else. - You're lying. - It's the truth! You have a beautiful body. Your skin is like a baby's. This is embarrassing. The fact that you're not all over me proves that you're middle aged. This feels so good! It's so liberating! This is the first time I've shown my naked body to a man. It's pink. It's embarrassing, Mister. Are you really okay with just looking at it? I'm hanging up now. You're so perverted. Please don't hang up. Please... I can't stand it any more. Missus. Welcome home. Who was that on the phone? So late at night? It was Katsuya's mom. Katsuya didn't make it into his first choice university. Is that so? But university isn't everything in life. No, a man's life is pretty much determined by it. Wakako. Wasn't that skirt a bit longer? - I made it shorter. - Why? It's almost spring, and I thought it may stimulate you a bit too. Am I no good? Why don't you try having a love affair? Why is that? Being a good wife and a mother must be boring. I wish I could do something like that. But I can't do it. Even if I wanted to, there's no one who would choose me. Something good happened to you today, didn't it? Why? I can tell. We've been together for 17 years. Nothing good, really. I was asked out to a movie by a young girl. That's all. You should have gone. No way. It would just exhaust me. Go have an affair. You know I can't do that. That's right. Are you tired of me? Aren't you the one who thinks that way about me? I... I'm completely satisfied. Me too. The kids, you... We're all healthy. Our family is my precious treasure. I see. That's right. I like you, Mister. Missus, I can't stand it any more. Ah, excuse me. Excuse me. - Miss Chako. - What is it? I'm going to my room, but what would you like to do? Have sex with me tonight. Promise me. It's cold. Hurry up. Yes, coming right away! - Mister, you lack manners. - Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. It's not scary at all. Just relax your body. It's scary. It's your first time, so you don't have to, Miss Chako. It doesn't have to be today. Your heart is beating fast. I'm nervous... Come on, relax your body. Huh? Does it hurt? It hurts! Please stop, Mister! Does it hurt? It's all right. We're connected. Are you happy now, Mister? I'm really happy. Ouch... I love you, Miss Chako! You looked so happy in your sleep. Really? I was probably really happy. - I'm not cute, am I? - Why not? It was my first time, but I'm not emotional about it. Not at all. It wouldn't be like Miss Chako if you got emotional. Hi. - Yo! - How are you? Good. - Call me sometime. - Yes, I will. - Who is he? - A friend. Stop it, Mister. Don't think I'm yours just because we did it once. It's just once a week that I'm your lover. What do you do on other days? That's my freedom. Don't interfere with it. She'll change eventually. It'll be inevitable that she is going to miss me so much. I'll turn her into that kind of woman. What were you doing? Well... mahjong! I was joking! - Where are the kids? - They're eating. All right. Your father's home. - Where have you been, daddy? - Huh? Mahjong! You play mahjong all night? Mahjong is part of work too. Stop asking annoying questions. Mommy was worried, you know? She's not worried at all. Right? Right! Hello, Mikuni residence. Good morning. You have a cold? - I'll get your breakfast ready. - Huh? It's all right. Hiroshi, I've heard your entrance exam is coming up, right? I'm just like you, you know. You're not subtle at all, huh? - Fever? - Can I have this? No. - 40 degrees? - You're mean. Is there a doctor nearby? How about this place in this neighborhood? It's an old building, so it can't be like new, but it's cheap for a place that's 5 to 6 minutes to the train station. - That's true. - Yes, here. Oh my goodness! Wow, you're right. The woman is middle aged. She's sexy. And the man is young. She's getting it from the back. So it seems. Hey, don't show us your dirty butt. You're such a bad boy. Telling me you're sick with a fever. You wouldn't have come if I hadn't said so, Missus. Wakako! Wakako! What are you doing? Were you in the department store? Yes, how about you? Oh, there's a pachinko parlor with a decent machine. I go there sometimes. You're playing pachinko all the time. It's been awhile since we came to a cafe on our own. That's true. You've gotten pretty recently. I was thinking, "That's a beautiful woman", and it was you. What has happened to you? Your skin is supple too. Come on, stop it. You don't find this kind of skin on a young girl. - It sounds like you know young girls. - Huh? I don't have that kind of courage. That's right. You are serious and honest, right? I guess. I might sell the apartment. Is that so? The price has gone up quite a bit. I might invest in some stocks. Is that okay? Can I do what I want? Yes, it's yours, after all. Go ahead. Oh? It's red. It might be a hickey. - Is it red? - Yup. I see. Mosquitoes must be out already. It would be fun if it were a hickey. You should get a young lover too. Me "too"? Don't misunderstand. It's just a way of saying it. It's spring, so I feel energized. Friday? No, I can't on Friday. Yes. It's a bit rushed, but how about tonight? Oh, I see. That's perfect, then. Yes. Then, tonight at 7 PM at our regular place. Yes! Oh, it's you, Miss Chako. Mister, I'll see you tomorrow. Yes. I'm going to go watch a video at his apartment. This is Mister. Hello. - Is he your boyfriend? - That's right, Funata. See you! Bye bye! It's late, so go home soon. What's got into you? Jogging all of a sudden. You used to say you could never do something uncool. Stamina and health is top priority. - If you say so. - Dad! Today is Friday, right? - Why? - What do you mean why? What's wrong with Friday? There's a movie, so I thought we could both go. Oh, I see. I guess there's not much you can do about the entrance exam now. The rest is up to your father on his interview. I'll go with you. No way! I'll die from embarrassment. You don't have to be so cruel. I'm popular with young boys, you know? - I'm gonna do my best. - I'm going now! Next week is at 5 PM. - 5 PM. - Damn it! What are you doing, huh? Toyama. Wake up. It's breakfast. Thank you. Here! Wow. It's the taste of home cooking. Go wash your face and brush your teeth. Missus... We can't. It's Saturday and my husband comes home early. Toyama. I can't keep doing this with you forever. I'm a housewife, you see. Young boys have so much. Oh, you're early! Who takes a bath so early in the morning?! I'm not taking a bath. It's a shower. Where were you?! I went out shopping. What are you so upset about? I went shopping. It's the truth. You were having an affair, right? What are you talking about? Darling! Stop! Not here! Darling! You were having an affair with a young man. Right, Wakako? Huh? Isn't that right? No, I wasn't. Tell me you were. Yes, I was. Was he young? - He's 20. - 20?! Damn it! Was he good? Yes, he was! How many times? - I don't remember. - Damn it! Are you done? That caught me off guard. You're pathetic, being tossed around by a young girl like this. Can you even be called a man? I'm going out. I'm going out too! Can you please get the canned goods from Fujiya? Shut up. You always think it's pachinko. I'm not going there now! And your husband? Pachinko! Hi! This is my apology. Wow, you look upset. Not really, I'm not upset in the slightest. Were you playing pachinko all this time? You're so cute. I'm not someone who gets upset with such trivial things. Forgive me. We have a deal to have a date here every Friday. I paid 150.000 yen. I'm sorry. I drank too much and didn't feel well. Oh, I see. You were suspicious of me. You have to keep your prom... You can't make me wait... I said I'm sorry, haven't I? - But that Funato... - You brought him up again. He doesn't matter right now. Now is our time, Mister. It's all right. I'm not bothered at all. Of course you'd have a boyfriend... Stop it! Our relationship has nothing to do with Funato. The only time I'm your lover is on Fridays. The rest is my life. It has nothing to do with you. That was the deal. Remember? That's right. The bottles were all empty. I'm going to get some beer. - I'll go, it's far. - It'll be fine. Oh then, here's some money. It's fine, it's fine. Let me treat you. She's a good girl. A really good girl! It's still early. Where shall we go next? You don't want to be with an old maid like me forever. I want you, Missus. There are so many young and cute girls out there. - Someone might come. - Nobody is here. Is it all right if I come? It's all right. I love you. I... love you. Do you really love me? Miss Chako! Miss Chako! Miss Chako! There's a bottle in the cabinet, do you mind opening it up? Mister! Huh, what? I'm going surfing. See you! Bye bye! I'm definitely flunking. The test was okay, but the school puts more emphasis on interviews than test scores. Did you study about the school before you went? He supposedly forgot about it. Shut up! Why do you say things like that? He studied hard for three years. It's only natural that he's upset. I did my best in front of the interviewer. It can't be helped! The parents are always doing what they can for their kids. I should have gone instead. I thought this may happen. School history isn't everything! Yes, it is. What do you mean by that? Mom! - What is it? - Come here. What is it? Is something wrong? Hello? Hello? I'm sorry to call you. Oh my! I just wanted to see you. Today's not friday, but... Are you upset? No, I'm really ecstatic. It really hit me... What did? The person who supports me right now is you. You're the crutch to my heart. You're a dream, Miss Chako. I'm so happy. - Is it good? - Yes it is. I thought you'd like it, so I went to the factory to get some. Thank you. Was surfing fun? I guess. You're moving here from this week. I felt bad, but, in all honesty, 150.000 yen a month is not easy for an average business man. I understand. I want to be with you for a long time, so I sold the apartment. Sorry to ask, but can you endure a bit more? - It's interesting here. - Thank you. You can have sex with me today. But... It's not Friday. It's a special day, today. I burnt my knee on the tatami. It's cool and it feels good. Let's see. I have to get furniture... A bed would be better. I think a futon would be better here. - It would look better here. - It shall have a pink floral pattern. How come? That's so outdated. I want to sleep in a futon like that. I think it would take all the stress away. Not at all! - Say, Toyama. - Yes? I'll bring you a refrigerator next time. I want a futon more. It's falling apart. That's true. There's one at home that we don't need. It has a pink floral pattern. Is that okay? Yes! - What are you doing? - Huh? Didn't we have an extra futon? Yes, we do. It's a pink floral one. Pink floral? We really have one? What are you so happy about? Oh, nothing. Oh, the pot will boil over. Hey, Wakako! Can I have the pink floral futon? All right. What are you going to do with it? Did you rent an apartment with a young girl? No, no. It's for Kubota. - Kubota? - Yes! There's a guy who joined the company this year. He's from the country and rented an apartment. And so I promised him a futon... No way, that futon... Why not? Why not? It's extra and we all sleep on our beds. The pot is hot. Don't wander around in the kitchen. - Can I take it? - Why do you have to get on his good side? Whose trying to get on his good side? It's my sincere willingness to help as his boss. All right? Just get it out, please. - I said no. - I already told him I would! I promised Toyama as well! What? Who is Toyama? I thought something was fishy. You're actually having an affair with a young guy? Wakako! Please stop joking around. Let's not waste all this. Ouch! I know. About what? That Toyama. He's the guy who married Miss Yuka this year. It was on the wedding announcement. Hey... - Or was his name Togawa? - No, it's Toyama. Toyama. Oh, I see. You really do like helping out people, don't you? I wonder if she knows. Why would she say she'll come along? - Can you please turn left there? - Yes. Oh, dear. I wonder if he actually knows. Stop here. You get off here. Can you go to the department store to get some cigarettes? It's far from the apartment. Ah, okay, okay! Something wrong? My legs went numb. - Well then, see you later. - Yes. Please go. Maybe I'll stop by. Hello. It's NHK. We're here to collect payment. No, I don't watch it. I don't have a TV. Wakako? It can't be... She looks so much like her! Nope, it can't be her. She isn't that loud. Good, he's not home yet. What's wrong? I thought you were a thief. Is this okay? Thank you very much. Why are you so out of breath? There was a stranger following me, so I ran. I think I'll take a shower. Honey, is that good? It can't be. The middle aged woman having sex with a young man right across from my apartment, that's my wife. I must be crazy. I'm an idiot. My goodness. Someone so cute... There's something wrong with the world. What kind of girl? She's really cute. I'd say she's about 20. The guy is middle aged. Maybe 10 years older. He's pathetic. Did you pick this up to do things like this? Stop! It feels so good! Mister, not yet. Not yet. Not yet! You're going on top? I felt bold today. What you did was really unexpected. It felt so good. But you're still new at this... Goodbye. Let's make this the last day. Miss Chako, please wait! You can't. You can't leave all of a sudden. Mister, aren't you happy that I felt good? Um... well, you were... - A virgin until recently, so... - You have virgins all wrong. I have friends who felt good the first time. That's true. Logically, that's true. I understand it, but... I'm so into you, so... I'm not with anybody else. Okay, it's 10 PM. It's adult time. Kids go to bed. Let me play some more. No way. You never wake up in the morning. Put it away, hurry. - Good night, mommy. - Yes, have a good night. It's always like this! Go to sleep now. Tatsuya Fuji is so wonderful! He's such a sexy actor! A serious and honest middle aged man is so boring. Wow, amazing! He's the same age as you. What was that for? Don't make fun of me. What's wrong with being serious and honest? I want to be like that too! What happened to you? I want to smoke 7-Star but I choose Hi-Lite. I want to drink in Ginza, but I drink in Shibuya instead. There are foreign golf clubs that I actually want. But I chose the cheapest one and, on top of it all, on a monthly payment plan. And, then, what do you say? We're the same age? Damn you! I'm a pathetic middle aged man! - They'll hear you upstairs. - Shut up! In that case, I have something to say as well. What is it? Let's hear it. You say things like, "Akina Nakamori's legs are beautiful". Complimenting young girl's legs while you look at mine, and saying things like, "her body is sexy". I know I'm not sexy! I had two kids. It's only natural. My breast aren't as firm. I was going to feed them formula, but you told me to feed them breast milk. It wasn't me! It was the doctor at the hospital. No, it was you! You told me to because breast milk is free. Free? I would never say that! You did! On July 7, on our way back from the hospital. I didn't say it! You're such a liar! I'm amazed you can say such things. You're the liar. What? About what? You think I know nothing. Don't underestimate your wife. Who is sleeping on the pink floral futon? My lover! Miss Chako! She's 20 and her skin is supple! It's not just her body. Her heart is youthful and she's my lover! You wanna get a divorce? Let's do it! Can you please stop kidding around? Was there something at the office? You seem irritated. No. It's okay. You don't have to get promoted any further. I'll be happy as long as we can have a nice, quiet life. Please feel safe and go to work. I still have 20 years before I retire. It's okay! You can just relax and enjoy your monthly checks. You can spend time on what you want to do. I'm so sleepy. A 20 year old girl with supple skin, huh? That would be a dream. Hey, Wakako. When did you start feeling good? About what? You know... Well, you know, that feeling... After I had Hiroshi. You were so excited. We did it all night three times. I see. It's been over a year. It's strange. Hello? - Is this Mr. Mikuni? - Miss Chako? This is Chako's sister. Ah, pleased to meet you. There's something I want to talk to you about. Sure. Are you Miss Yasuko? Miss Chako's sister? Excuse me. Can you come with me, please? I did just like you said. Chako is dating the son of a CEO. It's an important time for her. Hi. Hello. I'm sorry. It's not Friday, so I didn't think you would come. Are you kidding me? Aren't you mistaken about something? This is my room. Bringing a man just because it's not Friday... I didn't bring him here. You can go to a motel or something. We didn't come here to do things like that. With no lights and with the futon out... He said he had a headache, so I had him rest here for a bit. I think I caught a cold. I'm sorry. Miss Chako... It's goodbye. My dream is gone. Do you know how much I cherished... this room I shared with you? Even if nothing really happened... It's not kind hearted... What you did... It's not like you... I met your sister today. She was with a strange man and he told me to break up with you. I told him no. Absolutely not. He hit me. I'm not blaming you. I really felt that I liked myself. My mind went blank, but my blood boiled. That hasn't happened for awhile. I discovered that I can be this honest for a woman. I was happy. I wanted to think about you, so... I came here. Mister, you shouldn't try to play it cool too much. About what? Who's playing cool? You're laying a lot of logic, but all you want is to have sex with a young girl, right? A young man like yourself wouldn't understand. A dream, you say? This is a room to have sex with a young girl. That's all this room is. Stop making up excuses and have sex with Chako on Fridays. A relationship between a man and a woman is putting it in and out, anyway. You're young and yet your thoughts are sad. It's not sad! I mean, I actually like Chako too. But I'm okay if she has sex with you. I respect her reasons. Don't you feel pathetic being paranoid about her sleeping with someone else? Where is your passion? I have what you call "love". Love? That's just an illusion. She's just your type. Can you please leave? I'm in no mood for a discussion with a young person. "A woman with a beautiful face. A woman with a beautiful body. I desperately want that woman". That feeling of "want" is what you call "love". You're wrong. You're still young. Go home. Then, why don't you marry Chako? Shut up. They're just excuses. You just want her. Did it hurt, Mister? Yes. I'm sorry. But I really liked you. Just on Fridays, right? Yes, just on Fridays. But I liked you the most in the world. I don't understand. I'll go home now. - I'm going now. - Thank you. - Fujiko! - Yes? - Nakahara. - Yes? - Can I join you? - Oh, is it okay? It's a Friday today. Don't make a fool out of me and let me join. Manager! It's for you. - Oh! - I guess you can't join us, after all. Please wait. Hello? You're asleep. You're late! It's over now. It's true. The futon and cushions are all gone. I threw everything away along with my dream. But you seem happy, Mister. I matured thanks to you, Miss Chako. - But there's one day left on the contract. - That's fine! No, it's not. Please have sex with me. I broke up with Funato, you see. Sex isn't just about getting it in and out. I'm just old-fashioned. One last time, yes? I'll make it worth your while. Darling! Toyama! Please stop, Toyama! There's no point in sweating about it now, Missus! I have to go home and prepare dinner. If you want me to go back to my parents', I will. You're not going to accuse me? Not at all. Why don't you join me. Who is he? He's a boxer. Never makes it to the finals. I see. He's young and has an amazing body. And her? She said she was a freelancer. She had a nice body. I just wanted to experience youth again. I finally got it. Wakako. I love you. I finally understand now. Mother! I got in! I'm in! You're just like me! Oh, darling! Are you doing well?
