They say running is good for your physical condition. Thats nonsense. The only effect it has on me- -is that i'm sweating like a pig. The ones having fun are Boris and Rebecca, He allways does when i run around. Anyone who wants to keep such a beautifull girl- -has to stay fit. Boris! It's just so exhausting. Maybe i'm just growing old. Hi! Boris come here! Come on, get inside. Yes, you are still young beautiful and attractive. Like allways. Can you help me? -Nope i'll leave that in your hands. Shall i make some coffee? -Yeah nice and strong. I'll be right back. -Ok. Yeah i know, nice and strong Why no tea for a change. -I'd rather die. Did you go into town? -Yeah, i took your car. Where are you going now? -Take a guess. I don't understand. It all went so fast, my numb brain can't handle the fact she won't be at home later. Sometimes life grabs you by the balls... ...and all you can do is swallow and continue. But i'm not ready to swallow yet. See you around missy. Mark, you coming? "Dr. W. Bernhardt" "Psychoanalist" Relax. Relax. I want you to relax. Concentrate on the pendulum. Good. All tension releases. Keep following the pendulum. You're eyelids are getting heavy. You are getting sleepy. And close you're eyes. I want you to go back to the room where it happened. Relax. No need to be afraid. Good. Look at what's there. Stay calm. No need to be afraid. What do you see? What is happening? Look closely. Go on. Stay calm. Look at what's there. -What do you see? What's happening? -Go on. Relax. -What do you see. -Look closely Stay calm. -go on. -No need to be afraid. What's happening? -Look at what's there. -Go on. What do you see? -Stay calm. Look closely and let it happen. We can be satisfied. But, you are not there yet. See you next week. Oh, hold on. You know what you have to do right? I've broken the chainsmoking record in three days. My lungs are probably as black as my mood. Boris? What is it? What are you doing? Come here. come. Jesus how long do i know him- He's the only one i thrust with boris. -come with me man -what are you doing here all alone. Being alone. Call me, okay. I'm such an asshole, just leaving him somewhere else. Take care of youself. Rather an asshole than neglecting my dog. Go back inside, it's pouring. Take care, okay. Ciaou. "Rest... ...in peace... ...Rebecca..." Rebecca? I've spent all morning finding reasons not to get up. It doesn't work. I'll get up now. Strange... ...to find out on a graveyard that your grave mood is over. Now i swallowed, and its time to move on. Without Rebecca... ...or nice and strong coffee. I just have to find... ...four thousand things to fill the void. No problem. You lost you wife right? Yeah. So? Oh sorry, i didn't mean to be curious. Did you know my wife? I met her just once. And you? And me what? Did you lose somebody. Yes. Do you want to talk? I think i do. Tomorrow evening allright? Ok let's put it all together. Rebecca just died... ...the dog is away... ...and i am insane enough to make a date with a stranger God allmighty! Time to call a friend. Mark here. Ok, somewhat. Yes. Yes ofcourse, i get that. Sorry. Yes. How did the coffee go? I really just want to ask him if he thinks it's normal ... ...to chase strange girls in the cemetery so soon after your wife dies. Instead of that i just chit chat. And i just wonder if i should put on aftershave tomorrow night I wanted to ask if you could... ...keep my desk clead the next few days. That's nice, thank you. And, ehm, is Boris behaving himself? Yes, nice. Ok, see you then. There are those moment you realise you are going to make a mess of things. This is one of them. No aftershave tomorrow. Okay. So you're in love. That's your business. That doesn't mean you can just stop treatment. And look at me when i'm talking to you! You know real well you need help, and my therapy is the only way. Do you realy think somebody... ...would even take the time? It's too late for that. You went too far for that. okay. Let's talk about your sister. Yes? -You lost your wife right?- Martha Morbeck, i know it's late but i need to talk to you. Mark Embrechts. -I came to warn you. Won't you come in? -No time... ... there's someone you should be carefull with, she's a threat to you and your wife. My wife is dead. You have seen her, she was at you wife's funeral. She's watching you. That's where i've seen you, you were at my wife's grave. I was there because Colette was, she is dangerous. Sorry but ehm... ...i don't need this, could you please leave? Wait, people are being murdered! What do you mean? Actually they are dead allready, but they're not left in peace. I really don't need this! -I'll be back tomorrow with proof! Fine! Tomorrow? I won't be here. Coffee? -Yes. Black, right? I'm glad you came. It's important we talk. I'm aware that you dont want to continue treatment. But you underestimate the problems. Everthing that happened, obviously, left deep marks on you. That's why i want you to really listen to me. You are sick. Maybe more than you realise. And now you walk away from treatment. I feel fine. You need help and i'm the only one that can give it to you. I dont need help, especially not from you. You have too close to death, when you lost david. That's almost two years ago... ...i feel fine now. What are you getting at? You show too much initiative. You went too far. -Stupid asshole! Who is the asshole here! You are my patient. It was all your idea, you are the one that started it. I started it allright and i'll finish it to. That was delicious. Thank you. Dessert? Oh, coffee please. Nice and strong. Damn it! There we go again. Why did i say that anyway? I hated Rebecca's 'nice and strong' coffee. In need of some 'strong' comforting? Here i am. In a suit that's too tight, a little lightheaded... ...in the house of a beautifull unknown woman. These are not the ways of a fresh new widower. I need to get out of here. Finish the coffee quickly... ...and find some excuse. Can i help you with something? No, that's okay. The coffee is on it's way. I ehm... ...want to thank you for the invitation. You understand i had to get out of my house for a while. Where can i find the bathroom? At the end of the hall on your right. Sorry, i thought i smelled something. The toilet is over there. You know it? -Yeah i do. Have you been playing long? Three years now. Do you know a "Martha"? -Why? She came by my house yesterday. To warn me. What for? -About you. That doesn't surprise me. So you know her. -Yes. She's my sister. She was pretty spitefull about you. I thought so. Martha is the kind of person that doesn't forgive easily, you know. She had a lover, nothing special, but apparently... ...she was obsessed by him. He fell in love with me and i with him. Lonely Martha. That's life sometimes. Yeah, thats life sometimes. A year ago he died of a heartattack. Since he died Martha went on a crusade against me. Not that much. Was... he the one you... ...you visited on the cemetary? Yes. Shall we talk about something else? Yeah. What is it? Maybe it's better that i go. Yeah yeah, i know. What the hell is going on here! Was Martha right? Is this your doing? -They were dead already! What about Martha, or me! You have a strong instinct for survival mr. Embrechts. Wait. Wait! Offcourse. I'm not in a hurry. It's all gone a little out of hand i'm afraid. Who are you? She was my patient. You know about this? -Absolutely. You know what they say about madmen. No, what do they say about them. Once a madman allways a madman. When she came to me, one year ago, there was only fear. An all consuming fear of death. Her lover died in her bed while she was tied down. They were found a week later. I saw immediately that drastic measures were needed. I had to confront her with death... ...getting her to relive her fears. Reliving? Indeed, it all started quite innocent. We took the bodies of the recently deceased from of their graves. After that there was... ...a confrontation between Nicollette and the deceased. But i won't get further into that. It's just that... Nobody was supposed to find out mr. Embrechts. You are insane. You know what's insane? What happened when i confronted Nicollette with your wife. But i wont go further into that. You know what they say about the dead. No... ...what do they say about the dead? That you have to leave them in peace. Sometimes life grabs you by the balls. Literally. Thank god it's over. Shall we skip the foreplay? Over my dead body.
