But I think it may be indicative of a larger problem. -Desmond Ranes is-- -Absolutely perfect? But now he's almost too perfect. You've built him into an unrealistic concept of a hero. I have a theory, but, um, I'm not sure if I should say it. Well, you can't say that and not say it. Maybe, just maybe, being a romance novelist who's too picky to ever go on a second date is starting to become a problem. Well, what's wrong with having high standards? You have impossible standards. Okay, look, I'm just saying, if you stopped looking for Desmond and started looking-- -I have an idea. -Okay. Great. I go away for a week to Silver Springs for Christmas as always, and then I'll come back recharged and ready to rewrite the end of my book. Sounds fun, but, no can do. Izzi, your holiday-themed book was supposed to be available for the holidays. You're gonna make me work through Christmas? That is so Ebenezer of you. [sighs] I'm sorry. The only reason I fought so hard to get you this third deadline is because you're my most successful author and my best friend. Which means you're kind of okay. And you're not that bad yourself. [telephone ringing] Good morning. Antler Lodge. Hey, Bob. It's Izzi. Izzi! Great to hear from you. I'll be seeing you in a few hours, yes? Unfortunately no. Oh, no. Did something happen? Are you okay? No, I'm fine. It's just some work stuff came up. Well, why don't you come up and work from here? I mean, you can write anywhere, right? I can, but my editor said I need to rework my book. Izzi, I understand, but it's just, it wouldn't be Christmas without ya. [Izzi on phone] I know. I work so hard all year. Antler Lodge is my favorite place on Earth. [sighs] Sorry for the pity party. I'll see you next year. Actually... there is something I should tell you. -Bob is retiring! -Who? [Izzi] The owner of the B&B, this could be the last time I get to stay in my room. And by my room, I mean my room. What does this have to do with you finishing your rewrite? I have to enjoy Antler Lodge while I still can. What if the new owner changes everything? You know I don't like change. And by "Don't like change" you mean stuck in your own ways? You know I've gone to Silver Springs every year since my parents moved to Florida. It's more than a vacation for me. It's my Christmas home. Okay. I can tell how important it is to you. Good, 'cause I'm already on my way. Okay, you just have to promise me you're going to focus. This trip will be completely and totally about me and Desmond. That almost sounds romantic. [chuckles] Don't I wish? I'm kidding. He's a fictional character I created. Okay, now that that's cleared up, I'm gonna say goodbye, and happy writing. [Izzi] Thanks, Mila. I won't let you down. [Mila on phone] Okay. Bye. [instrumental music] [man] Oh, ho-ho-ho!

[Izzi] Mila, you have to call me back. You're not gonna believe what just happened. [instrumental music] "Antler Chalet?" What the... -[Bob] Izzi? -Bob! Ah... -You're here! -I made it. [sighs] How many years have you been coming up here now, nine? -Ten. -Ten? So I saw the new sign. When did you change the name? About a month ago, but I still catch myself saying Antler Lodge every now and again. Hey, let me check you in. -Hm. -Here we go. All right, we have Izzi Simmons checking into room four as always. -For six nights? -Yeah. I'll be leaving the day after Christmas. Okay. -Just you? -Yes, Bob. Like always. Oh, I was hoping maybe you would've brought someone with you this time. -Just Desmond Ranes. -Hm? -The character from my books. -Oh. I have a rewrite due the 25th, so this trip'll be more business than a nonstop Christmas celebration, unfortunately. [sighs] Oh, that's too bad. Well, in case you find some free time, I know you know these by heart, but here's an itinerary of the activities this week. -[sighs] -[Bob] It's gonna be fun. Thanks, Bob. These look great. [door opens] [instrumental music] [Izzi] Hm. All right, Desmond, it's just you and me. Let's make you more real. Though maybe you're more real than I thought. You look a lot like the guy I almost ran over. [chuckles] [instrumental music] Uh, what happened to the squeaky floor? [instrumental music] Okay, we'll see you then. Bye-bye. [wheelchair whirring] Izzi. What do I owe the pleasure again? I just have a quick question. Let me guess. You saw the remodeled aesthetics. About that. Um, my floors... I mean, your floors, technically, they used to have a distinct squeak. But the thing is, now the squeak is gone and there's a carpet over the floorboards. I'm sensing you don't like the carpet. Was this your idea? No, it was, uh, his. Meet the new owner of the B&B, my son. He just moved back from Seattle. -Desmond? -Uh, actually, no. It's, uh... It's Matt. -Matt? -Yup. Matt. -Your name is Matt? -Yeah. Like, short for Matthew. You look exactly like... You know what, um, never mind. This is, this is so... This is something, this is confusing and confounding and a little bit exciting. Uh, okay. Well, to answer your question, uh, you're not hearing that squeak 'cause I fixed the floorboards. It's actually very simple, you just sprinkle a little baby powder over the squeaky floorboard, work it into the seams. Lubricates the wood, keeps the boards from rubbing together. -Neat. That's, like, so neat. -Yeah, well. I realized it's only a temporary solution. -So, uh, we went carpeted. -No, you went carpeted. We went squeaky floors, right, Bob? Oh, I'm going Switzerland on this one. -Are you? -I'm gonna go out of this room. Um, I have to leave, um, my editor is calling and I have to take this in my room. Your phone didn't ring or buzz. Um, I meant, I have to call her. -You know how editors are. -No. Not really. How are they? They need to be called back. Well, you better call her back then. That's what I'm gonna do. Bye! [laughs] [line ringing] Come on, pick up, pick up, pick up! -Hi, Izzi. -[Izzi] Finally you answer. Guess what? Desmond Ranes is here! Whoo-hoo! Guess that fresh mountain air inspired you, huh? Inspired? No. Desmond is here. -Like, in Silver Springs. -Like, physically? I mean, it's Matt, not Desmond. But, still, this is crazy, right? Are you sure you're not the one going crazy? What do you think this means, do you think this is like a sign from the universe? I think if this is some sort of fake freak-out to get out of finishing your book, it's creative, I'll give you that, but it's not gonna work. No, Bob, the owner of the B&B, his son, Matt, looks identical to Desmond. -It's, like, uncanny. -Okay, it's finally happening. You've romanticized Desmond so much, you're having full-on hallucinations. I promise. I'm not going crazy. -And I'm gonna prove it. -Oh, no. No! -Izzi, what are you gonna do? -You'll see, you'll see. -You'll see! -Izzi! Excuse me, folks. Matt, why are these in the trash? -I love these old lamps. -Oh. Yeah, it just doesn't really go with the aesthetics, dad. -I, uh... -Look. I mean... I wondered where they were, they've been one over there and one over there.. [gasps] Oh. -Hi. -Hi. -What's your name? -Kacey. -I'm Izzi. -Nice to meet you. -What you doing? -Um... I... I was playing a game. Cool. How do you play? Well, you take a stranger and you try to figure out what they're like and who they are. -Sounds weird. -You're right, it is. But it helps me come up with characters. I'm a writer. No way. I'm a writer, too! -Yeah? -Yeah. Well, in that case, how about you help me and tell me how I'm doing? -Sure. -Okay. Matt over here, Bob's son, he's rugged and romantic, complex, yet invaluable. He's the kind of guy that would brave snowstorms to save his one true love. So what do you think? [Matt] What do we have here? Uh... -Hi again. -Hi. Kacey, you're not bothering one of our guests, are you? We were actually just playing a... -Wait, is she your daughter? -Yeah. Still my daughter? Yeah. [chuckling] Dad, you know, Izzi's a writer, too. I am, indeed. A romance novelist. And she was spying on you before. -Huh? -Okay, that is my cue. And I'm gonna leave now. -Your editor calling? -Yeah, probably. You know what they say about editors. [Izzi and Matt] They need to be called back. So, um, I'll see you around the lodge. -Chalet. -[Izzi] The lodge. Sign says chalet. [Izzi on phone] Did you get the photo? -Uh-huh. -Well? [Mila] You weren't kidding. I mean, yes, Desmond's a painting and he's younger and more buff, but, yeah. They're basically identical. [Izzi] There has to be an explanation. I mean, can you ask Bianca? Maybe she used Matt as inspiration. Well, Bianca didn't create the original art. She took over after your first book. Oh. Well, can you try to track down the original artist? I'll dig, you write. -[Izzi] Okay. Bye. -Talk soon. Is it just me or is, uh, your favorite guest interesting? Izzi? Well, if you mean that as a compliment, then, yes, she is. [Jennifer] Hello, Bob, Matthew. -Hey, Jennifer. -Jennifer Whitaker. What a figure! [laughs] -[laughs] Thank you. -You're welcome. -Been a while. Hey. -Hi. How are you? Good. How are you settling in? -Is it good to be back home? -Yeah, I'm settling. And, yeah, no, it's good-good to be back. Get to spend some time with the old man. Who are you callin' old, huh? [laughs] Most importantly, uh, Kacey seems to like it, so... -Oh, good. I'm glad to hear it. -Yeah. Uh, so what brings you by? Well, I noticed that you don't have lights up outside yet. Don't forget that our annual Christmas Lights Of Silver Springs Festival is coming up on Christmas Eve. Oh, you mean the competition every business on Main Street participates in that my dad hasn't won in over a decade? -Never heard of it. -Please. I got a plan. I got a plan. Don't worry. Just, uh, keepin' it close to the chest. Ooh. I like that. Well, I'll let you get back to it. -See you around. -Yeah. -Buh-bye. -[Jennifer] See you, Bob. -Thanks for stopping by. -Of course. [chuckles] Jennifer Whitaker. Wow. -Mathew? -Yup. You know that Jennifer judges the lights competition. -Right? -And? She's had a crush on you since high school. -Dad. -It could help our chances. Dad, please. Um... Son, you've been single for three years-- Dad, we talked about this. No, we haven't talked about this. -Plus, I got a plan. -I've seen some of your plans. -Sticking to the plan. -All right. ♪ And I said ride on Santa won't you ride on now ♪ ♪ Ride on Santa won't you ride on now.. ♪ Izzi, you're here! -Christmas can officially begin. -Yay!

This is so thoughtful. -Thank you. -Well, come, talk with me. How's your wife Parker? -And Timmy? -Gosh. They're so great! Timmy's almost ten, if you can believe it. Wow. Hey, why have you never mentioned your mystery brother, Matt, from Seattle? The one who never spends Christmas at the second-most Christmas-y place in the world. -Second? -North Pole. Oh. Right. I'm guessing you two finally met. Yeah, and he reminds me of... an old friend. Really? And what's this friend like? Oh, you know, he's romantic, heroic and handsome. Uh, question. Why does any of that remind you of Matt? [Matt] You again. I'm not stalking you, although, I was here first, so, technically, that would make you the stalker. If you say so. -Parker will be here any minute. -Great. Oatmeal raisin? Out of all the cookies here, that's, that's the one you picked? What's wrong with oatmeal raisin? It's my favorite. Soft and chewy, slight crisp on the edges. Loaded with oats, studded with raisins. You really are a writer. That was beautiful. Anyway, not a fan of raisins. You're right. Desmond would never cookie-shame Catarina. I've gotta go. I have some writing to do. See you all later. Bye. Uh... -Who? Who's Desmond? -I don't know.

No. Talking is fine. -Oh, okay. -Oh. That is the second day in a row. -Clumsy, huh? -In my defense... Yesterday I almost got run over. Oh, it was probably some teenager who just got their license. Classic Chad. -Tad. -Brock. -Tanner. -Bryan. That's a normal name. Anyway, I was just saying to Sarah how funny it was that you and I have never met. Well, we used to spend the holidays with Kacey's mom's family. Since Silver Springs does their big Christmas in July celebration, we'd come back for that, you know, double up. -I bet Kacey loved that. -Oh, you have no idea. So what did you do in Seattle? Well, I was the manager of a big hotel. What brought you back to Silver Springs? Your dad's retirement? Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. I-I thought it would be good to slow things down a little, be closer to family, especially for Kacey. Ultimately, I just want what's best for her. Hey, speaking of my dad retiring, he and I were discussing how you seemed concerned with the updates I've been making. -Antler Lodge is perfect as is. -Uh... Antler Chalet will be even more perfect when I'm done with it. Well, not if you keep... Wait, did you say that you were talking about me? I mean, we, well, we... We were talking about one of our customers' complaints. I would say constructive criticism is more accurate. Well, your constructive criticism has been noted. And on that note, I should get back to work. Oh, don't worry, we're not bulldozing the B&B for a strip mall till next Tuesday. -Cute. -I know. -Bye. -Bye. Yes. Okay, pivotal scene. Surrounded by stars, Desmond and Catarina sit snugly on the chairlift. Catarina admires the picturesque ski lodge below. [cell phone ringing] -Hi, mom! -Hi, sweetie. Did you make it to Silver Springs? [Izzi on phone] Yeah, I'm just working on the art of candy-cane balancing. Writer's block hasn't lifted? [Izzi] Not yet. How's Boca Raton? The least Christmas-y place in the world. Well, last night we went to a boat parade. Yeah, talk about the proper usage of the word float. He's literally said that 400 times since last night. How's the golf going, dad? Oh, mom didn't tell ya? I've gone pro. Hey, listen, if this is a work trip, don't forget to keep all your receipts. Here we go. We almost made it through an entire conversation without dad bringing up the receipts. Honey, honey, honey. Whether you buy a cup of coffee or buy a new pair of boots, everything can be considered inspiration for the book. So keep your receipts and write them off. You know what? Maybe you're right, dad. Everything around me is inspiration. It's just a matter of perspective. -I should go. -Already? -Are you getting enough sleep? -Okay, I gotta go. Okay, well, don't work too hard, sweetie. -I should go, mom. -Okay. We love you! -Okay. I love you. -Okay. Big kiss. I miss you, okay? I have to go. Okay. We love you. Mwah, mwah, mwah. Mom! Bye. [instrumental music] [Izzi thinking] Then Desmond says, "Don't worry, I'm not bulldozing it to build a strip mall until next Tuesday." Mulled cider was an integral part of the wassailing tradition. Back in medieval England, during Christmastide, people would go door-to-door, singing and offering a drink of warm apple cider from the wassailing bowl in exchange for gifts. And this was an early form of Christmas caroling. Yes! Are you going to sing for us again this year? -It's under consideration. -[chuckles] So are you really willing to give all this up? Oh, this part? No way. But the rest of it, the bookkeeping, the maintenance, and all that, yeah, I think I've had my fill. Understood. So what's next? -No clue. -Well... I'm sure you'll figure out something. Dad, Izzi, refill? -Oh, no, thanks, I'm good. -I'm good, too. -Have fun. -Thanks. Uh, for the record, still not stalking you. You could've fooled me. Nothing like hot cider on a cold night, huh? [Izzi] It's the best. -Hey, Matt. -Hey. -I have to take off. -Oh. Yeah, I swear, being on the town board during the holidays is like a 24-7 job. -Hi. I'm Jennifer. -Izzi. I think we met last Christmas. Actually, I think I met, I met you here. -At the happy hour. -Oh, really? Yeah. I'm pretty certain. Actually I'm a hundred percent. Well, it's great to see you again. Aren't all the improvements Matt's making to the B&B fantastic? Oh, I have already chatted Matt's ear off about all the improvements. -[chuckles] -Yeah. Okay then. Matt, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Yeah. Excuse me. [Bob] Izzi. So what do you think? -Let's do it. -Yeah. Let's sing.

Ha-ha, you know, it's supposed to project the light show on the side of the B&B. Hm. Okay, when it's all set up properly, it is going to look awesome. My dad, he takes the Lights Festival very serious, as I'm sure you know. Oh, I know. He doesn't seem like someone who's into the whole Christmas rave look. He usually goes with string lights every year. Yeah. And every year he doesn't win. So I'm trying something new. Which I'm sure you have an opinion about. I don't know, I just, I feel like you can't beat a classic. Oh, no, don't worry, I got a master plan. Have you seen the bookstore? Icicle lights, sleigh on the roof? You can imagine exactly what that's gonna look like when it's all lit up. It's anti-climactic. -Maybe you're right. -Yeah. I'm just testing out this bad boy, but I'm waiting until Christmas Eve to set it all up. That way I don't show my hand prematurely. You have definitely given this a lot of thought. It'll all be worth it when I'm accepting my trophy. There's no trophy, but sure. -No trophy? -Well, have a good night. Goodnight. I didn't know you could sing. How would you know? We're just getting to know each other. Yeah. I guess we are. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Yup. It's in the bag. [clattering] Oh. Okay. I think this piece goes right there. -Yup. -How about this one?

Uh, it's a work in progress, but it's gonna look great. Trust me. Okay, princess. -Come on, time for bed. -It's my bedtime, too. Sure you don't want me to stay on the couch? Answer's still no. Bed, bed, bed. Come on. Listen, I've been looking at this little cabin just outside of town, but it's been a little busy with the holidays-- Dad, dad, we talked about this. This is your house. This cabin belongs to the owner of the B&B. -And that's you now. -Okay. And I couldn't be happier about it. Still, take the bedroom. Okay. Fine! Ho! Here. -Tu-tu-tu-tu. -[chuckles] Did you have fun with your Cousin Timmy today? Yeah. Aunt Parker let us make paper snowflakes. Oh, I know this place is smaller than our old house, but Silver Springs is a great place to grow up. Yeah. I'm just trying to make the best decisions for your future, okay? -Our future. -Oh. That's right. Bop. Bop. Bop. Tch. Pshoo. -Love you, kiddo. -Love you. All right. Sleep tight. ["Silent Night" playing] [birds chirping] [gasps] At least I made it to the bed. [instrumental music] -Hi. -Good morning, Kacey. Welcome, everyone. Our tradition is for returning guests to bring an ornament from somewhere in the world that they have traveled.

I-I mean, we're happy you're here at the B&B. You're like the Christmas queen. Would you be surprised you're not the first person to call me that? I'd be willing to bet on it. -Yeah. -[Izzi] Okay.

And I have a lot of rewriting to do before my deadline. [telephone ringing] Izzi? [sighs] Okay. So you know how you're a writer? -In theory, yes. -Okay. Well, I started writing a story, but I don't really know what should happen next. Is that your story? -Can I see it? -Yeah. "Once upon a time there was a king and a princess. The two of them lived in a great kingdom." That's all I have so far. I love it! Sometimes the best ideas come from when you're trying not so hard to think of them. When your head is clear. -Okay. Well, how do I do that? -I like to get my body moving. Usually I'll go for a push in my neighborhood. But since we're in Silver Springs, I have an even better idea. -What? -Bowling. My favorite lanes are in Silver Springs. In fact, I think I'm gonna go do that right now. But what if you get an idea while you're bowling? Well, I keep one of these on me. It's small enough to fit in a pocket. You know what? Why don't you have this one? -Serious? -Serious. Good luck with it. -Thanks, Izzi. -You're welcome, Kace. [Matt] Oh, come on. What? This booking software. [laptop keys clacking] Dad, I think we should clear our heads a little. Maybe move our bodies. I can't right now, princess. I'm sorry. Booking software's driving me cra... You know what? Yeah. Maybe break's a good idea after all. -Okay. -What do you wanna do? [bowling ball clatters] [pins clattering] Yes! Yes! [Matt] You know, for a writer, you don't seem to do a lot of actual writing. You know, I was just thinking how much fun it would be to win against an opponent, and you magically arrived. -Batter up. -Uh, that's not... -That's the wrong sport. -It's kick-off time.

It's good to see you again so soon. -Yeah, this is a small town. -Yeah. -Whoa! -[Izzi] Yes! -Strike! That was... -Go, Izzi! Strike. I mean, that was good follow through. If you're calling to tell me you're extending my deadline, I accept. Going that well, huh? [Izzi] Let's just say I'm still waiting on the mountain air to inspire me. [scoffs] I see. I went bowling last night to try to clear my head, but it didn't work. Let's try thinking outside the box. [Izzi] Okay. Remember, your hero doesn't always have to save the damsel in distress. -Like, they support each other? -Okay. So I was bowling with Matt-- You two went bowling? Together? Well, he showed up when I was there. but he had no idea what he was doing, and so I taught him a few things and I helped him. Well, that sounds kinda sweet. I mean, Catarina helps Desmond. Right. He can be imperfect. Made of flesh and blood like Matt. This is so helpful. I'm gonna get to work right now. -Thanks, Mila. -[Mila on phone] Bye. After Desmond hits yet another gutter ball, Catarina gives him a lesson. "Hold your hand straight, follow through to shoulder-height." He takes the lesson with humility, and it feels good to be the one helping him for once, the two of them learning to support each other. -[Kacey] Hey, where's Izzi? -Oh, I asked her to join us. -But she's hard at work. -Ah, as a writer, I understand. -[laughs] Hey, Matt! -Hey. -Dad! -Oh, I feel bad. We're off to play in the snow, and you're staying behind. Do not feel bad, it'll give me a chance to fix a few wobbly doorknobs. Fair enough. Honestly, I don't mind taking the lead because sledding is my favorite activity. They're all your favorite activities, dad. Kacey and I live for the thrill. -[Bob chuckles] -Be careful. "Be careful." [knocking on door] Who is it? [Matt] It's Matt. Come in! Oh. Sorry to interrupt. I thought you'd be sledding. Oh, I'd love to be, but duty calls. Got it. Well, I can come back later. It's okay. Do what you need to do. -Sure? -Mm-hmm. [Matt whistling] Wait. What are you doing? Just swapping out the doorknob. -What's wrong with the old one? -Uh, it's old. So? Don't you have any sentimentality? For doorknobs? Uh, nope, I don't. No, I just mean, there's something romantic about this place's quirks. The squeaky floorboards and all that. I don't think anyone's ever written a hotel review that started with, "I loved the squeaky floors." -Oh, I definitely would. -Uh, wouldn't it be nice... To have a doorknob that works? It works. -See? -Wait, no. Don't do that. Oh. Well, it's not that big of a deal. It's not like we're locked in here. Right? -We are so locked in here. -No way. Well, thanks a lot. -You should've told me! -I tried! Well, you have a screw driver. Can't you take the hinges off? Now, I could, but the hinges are on the other side, so... Haven't you ever heard of the expression if it's not broke, don't fix it? The doorknob was literally broke. Agree to disagree. -I'm calling the front desk. -Yeah, don't bother. No one's there. I'm supposed to be at the front desk. Why are you not at the front desk? Because I was fixing the doorknob. -[chuckles] -You know what? I'll call my dad, tell him we're stuck in here and he'll... -What's wrong? -I left my phone. -At the front desk. -Well, you can use mine. I don't have my dad's cell memorized. What? You don't know your dad's number? It's just, it's in my phone. Why would... Wait, do you have everyone's number memorized? -Well, no. -Oh. Okay. I guess we're not agreeing to disagree on this one. [scoffs] Ooh. -[whistling] -Uh, what are you doing? Getting comfy, sledding usually lasts a couple of hours. It's very fun. Then you should be doing it instead of disturbing the guests. I have to get back to work. [laptop keys clacking] Tell me a story. What are you, five? -And a half. -[giggles] Oh, come on, why not? All I know are romance stories. And the age recommendation is fourteen and up. So... Okay, well, why don't you tell me how one becomes a romance novelist? -You really wanna know? -Yeah. I do. It's not like you're getting much writing done at the moment anyway. Well, I wonder why. I was always writing, even as a kid. Kinda like Kacey. As long as I can remember, my favorite part of the fairy tales was the love story. Meeting Prince Charming, love at first sight, true love's kiss, all of that. So I ended up creating my own version of Prince Charming and I was able to make him and Catarina, his eternal love, into a successful romance series. But my fourth book, up until this afternoon, has been such a struggle to finish. And why do you think that is? I'd rather not say. Oh, come on. And now I'm curious. Let's just say that there's a theory that the impossible standards in my love life have started to affect my professional life to the point where I'm writing about unrealistic love instead of real love. That's understandable, though. -You think? -Yeah. After my wife passed, um... Well, let's just say that when you get knocked down like Kacey and I, um, getting back up, standing on your own two feet again, it's, it's hard, it's really hard. I got you. Of course. -I'm sorry, I-- -No. I mean, it's fine. I just, I know what it feels like to get knocked down in life. I guess, with your writing, uh, now you have the ability to create a happily ever after. I can see how that'd feel safe... almost perfect. You're different than I thought you'd be. I'll take that as a compliment? Your call. You wanna hear something weird? -Actually, never mind. -I'm sure it's not that weird. Okay, I didn't know if I should bring this up, but you look exactly like Desmond Ranes. Okay, who is this Desmond guy you keep bringing up? He's the character from my books. All right. I got to see this. Look. -Uh... -You see it, huh? It's weird, right? Yeah, it's not that, it's, um... [Parker] Matt? Matt, are you here? Yeah! Um, upstairs! Room four! [door unlocks] We've been trying to call, Bob fell off his sled and hurt his leg. He's in the lobby. Dad... We were locked in. Is he okay? I'm fine, I just turned my ankle when I flew off, uh, fell off the sled. Flew off? Did you take a jump, dad? Well, it was more like a little bump that looked fun. -Right, Kacey? -I'd say so. Well, that's what a jump is, dad. A bump that looks fun. [sighs] Come on, it's Christmas time! -I like your spirit, Bob. -Yeah! Sarah, don't you have cookie decorating tonight? Oh, no! Oh, sh... It's in an hour. You don't think we can cancel it, do you? -Oh. -Wait a second. No one is canceling anything on my account. I guess only one of us needs to stay here with him. Well, no offense, but you're not good at cookie decorating. -So... -What? I'd be happy to help, Sarah. Oh, Iz, I can't ask you to do that. Don't you have to get back to your writing? Actually, I made a breakthrough today and made a ton of progress. It'd be my honor to be your sous-chef. -Amazing. -[Bob] Yeah! -[chuckles] Let's go. -I'll come, too. Okay. Let's go. Have fun! We will.

By the way, Kacey and I'll accept payment in the form of cookies. Done. I'm just gonna rest my eyes for a few minutes, so unless you wanna watch me sleep, you should go. Oh, and bring me back a couple of those gingerbreads I like. Are you sure, dad? I really don't mind sticking around. In case you need anything. [sighs] I'd kill for a nice tea. -Matt? -Yeah? I know that Silver Springs can feel a little small sometimes, but I'm so glad you and Kacey moved back. Me, too, dad. I'm excited for this next chapter, I promise. Feel like there's something you're not saying. Well, it's just that, I hope you don't spend the next chapter alone. -Dad. -Come on. Emily isn't the only one who'd want you to be happy. Kacey does, too. And from what I've seen, you and Izzi have real chemistry. Izzi? She doesn't even live here. She's a tourist. Ah, you can figure out all those details later. -For your ankle. -[sighs] -[chuckles] -Something, uh... Something happened. -Okay. Something good? -I don't know. Maybe. Yeah. No, I... Yeah, yeah, I really don't know. Okay, you know how Izzi writes those, those novels about that hero guy? -Uh, Desmond. -Yeah? Well, on the cover of those novels, uh, there's paintings of him. Except, uh... [chuckles] it's not him, it's me. I'm on the cover of the book, dad. Emily painted it. Well, how is that even possible? I mean, I know she was an artist, but I didn't know she did romance novels. I remember her being commissioned for a handful, I don't know. And you know how she always used the family as inspiration. But for that art to end up on Izzi's cover, for Izzi to be here now, I don't know, it almost feels like-- Like a sign. Wow. I couldn't have said it better myself. [Bob] No. That is a lot to process. Now, the decision for you is whether that's a bad sign or a good one. I think you know which side of the fence I'm gonna be on. Hm? Now, for more pressing matters. -Don't forget my gingerbreads. -To help your ankle feel better? -Exactly. -All right. -Stay off your feet, dad. -[Bob chuckles] I'll be good. [instrumental "Jingle Bells" playing] [indistinct chatter] [door shuts] [indistinct chatter] Hi. -[whispers] Hey. -Yeah, uh, they got here? [telephone ringing] -Sorry, I got to take this. -Sure. No problem. Yeah. [woman 1] Okay, yeah, what should I do? [woman 2] Snowman. [woman 1] Oh, a snowman. Yes. [woman 2] Santa? [woman 1] No. No. -[woman laughing] -Hey. I just wanted to see if Bob was okay. That's nice of you. Yeah. The, uh... The daredevil is in good spirits. -[chuckles] Great. -[Matt] Wants cookies, though. -Izzi, hi. -[Izzi] Hey. [Jennifer] Didn't Sarah set this all up so beautifully? Yeah. -She did a great job. -Do you wanna join and... No. I'll let you two get back to it. -Have fun. -Yeah, you, too. [Jennifer] Bye, Izzi. -Let's decorate. -Yeah. [indistinct chatter] Oh, well, well, what? [indistinct chatter] Izzi, can I help you decorate? I'd like that. -How's your story coming along? -So good! Every time I don't know what to write, I just walk around the B&B a couple of times. I even have my own trail through the snow. I love it. All right. [Izzi] Perfect. -Oh, ooh! -[Kacey laughs] Keep going. [Kacey] I can't wait for Christmas. [Izzi] Just two more days. Nice! Okay, how about another color? [instrumental music] [Izzi] The tie-dye Christmas-sweater cookie takes the top prize. Congratulations! -Uh, very funny. -So unfair. Blatant nepotism if I've ever seen it. -Still going, huh? -Oh, I got plenty more. [chuckles] It's all the sugar. I can't help it. So what are you doing over here all by yourself? -I was, uh, just thinking. -About your dad? You said it was just a sprain, right? Yes, yes, one of the things I was thinking about. Ah, more than that, I just don't know what he's gonna do with himself moving forward. Yeah. He's not the type to sit at home and watch game shows. Nope. He loves entertaining. He loves talking to tourists about Silver Springs. -Of course, he loves Christmas-- -Christmas. Maybe he could do all those things at the B&B. -And then you could do the rest. -I'd be fine with that. But he wants me to be able to do my own thing. Yeah, I get that. So what was the other thing you were thinking about? You got out of setting up, so maybe you can help me clean up? Sure. Yeah. I will help clean up. Excuse me. Oh, you helped out so much today. Thank you. -He'll do. -I'll do. -Bye. -Bye. Jennifer? Izzi. Hey, what's up? You're on the town board, right? -I am. -Can I walk you out? I have an idea I want to run past you. -Sure. -Okay. It's about Bob's future. [Kacey] Thanks. [Matt chuckles] [Izzi] I have to see this for myself. Shh. [instrumental music] [sniffs] How come there's only two shapes? They're canes and boots. Why do I feel like you had something to do with this? I couldn't help it. Oh, I love them, Kacey. Thank you. And thank you, too. And not just for the cookies, for everything today. My pleasure. Well, uh, I'm gonna get going. -Have a good night. -[Bob] Goodnight, Izzi. Uh, wait, I'll get the door for ya. Do you still have writing to do tonight? Some. But it's such a nice night out, I think I might go for a push. Sounds fun. Mind if I join? Sure. I'll grab my coat. [indistinct chatter] Main Street's gonna be so beautiful tomorrow. The Lights Festival is my favorite grown-up tradition. I've never met anyone who loves traditions as much as you do. It's refreshing. -Yeah? -Yeah. Well, this is another one of my favorites. Crockpot-toasted marshmallow hot chocolate. You gotta try it. -Want one? -Yeah. Yeah? Okay. -Hey, Steve! -Uh, two, please. It's a little bit hot, be careful. Thank you. -Okay. -Okay, here goes. -Mm. Mm. -Mm. -Now, this is delicious. -I told ya. Well, I'm loving that sweet roasted flavor. [Izzi chuckles] -Oh, you, you have some... -What? -Yeah. -Over there. -Okay. Right here. -[laughing] It's still there. It's still there? Okay. Gone? -We good? -Yeah, yeah. Gotta say, in the past few years, I've been so distracted just trying to get through my day... Being back in Silver Springs and seeing the world through your eyes, I don't know, it's, it's helping me appreciate where I came from. That's really nice of you to say. Oh, hey, I wanted to thank you. Yeah, for helping Kacey with her writing. Oh, anytime. She's such a good kid. Yeah. Yeah. Being her dad is... Well, let's just say it's the greatest adventure I've ever taken, that's for sure. She's lucky to have you. Her very own knight in shining armor. -Shall we keep going? -We shall. My lady. [instrumental music] What, are you proposing? The view is just better down here. There's, uh, there's something I need to tell ya. You know what? Oh, never mind. You can tell me. No, it's just such a nice night. -Honestly, it's almost... -Perfect? -Exactly. -Hm. -Let's just keep it that way. -Okey-dokey. -You sure? -Yes. I promise. Okay. -Shall we head back? -Come on. [Izzi] Suddenly she catches a rock and tumbles, almost falling off a cliff. Desmond races over. She reaches out her hand. With strength, he pulls her up. They fall back onto the soft snow. Then, Desmond slowly leans towards her... -[Izzi laughing] -[Matt] I know, I know. It looks like Santa's bag exploded. But not regular Santa, DJ Santa, who works weddings and bar mitzvahs the other weekends of the year. Okay, I was planning to wake up at 6 a.m. to test the lights in the dark one last time, but instead I woke up at 3:00 from a stress dream they wouldn't look good. Then my fears were confirmed. They, they look terrible. Well, what happened to the master plan? The synchronized music and all that? What happened is... -[upbeat music] -Oh. [laughs] Okay, wait, you, you like it. I do not. [music stops] Yeah, it doesn't sound as good as I remember. [chuckles] Well, maybe I can help. Thank you. Let's see. Here... Yeah. I think Christmas is all about tradition. You remember those big red, blue and green bulbs? The ones you actually had to screw in every single one? It'd take me and my dad hours, but we loved it. -Yeah, we had 'em, too. -Well... Some might say they're kind of dated, but to me, they're classic. They remind me of my childhood, it was so magical. Any chance you have a box of those old Christmas lights collecting dust in an attic somewhere? Oh, we don't even have an attic. But we do have a shed. All right. -Well, here, you check this one. -Okay. Ah. The '90s. Michael Jordan, Elaine Benes and classic Christmas lights. All right. Who's in charge of untangling these? This is a two-person job. [Matt] There is is one problem, the festival's tonight, my dad was supposed to help me set up, but with his ankle, that's not exactly an option anymore. And I know you're gonna offer to help with this-- I wasn't gonna offer to help. Oh, right, you have that big Christmas Eve deadline tonight. -I'm kidding! -I shouldn't have assumed. And by the way, I only have the ending left. But you're right, we can't do it all ourselves. -[instrumental music] -[laughter] [Matt] That's the spirit, Kacey.

Oh, right, no, just the cookie decorating. -And the Lights Festival-- -Okay, okay. If you wanna put up a life-size statue of me in front of town hall... -I'll allow it. -Oh. And we can put a plaque underneath that says "Izzi saves Christmas." There's a little something between the two of you. -Isn't there? -What? Wait, did he say something? Well, that answers that question. So have you talked to him? Does he know how you feel? -Not exactly. -Why not? Well, I'm just waiting for the right moment. Oh. Well, now's your chance. He's coming, so I'm just gonna go pretend... -Like I have something to do. -Wait. It's not pretending if you're telling me it's pretending. -Sarah! -Hey, Sarah. Hiya. Yeah, well, I'm real busy right now. Ah. -It's nine 9 o'clock at night. -[Sarah] I'll just, uh... -[Sarah] Cookies, baking. -[sighs] Okay. -Hey. -And where have you been? Oh, gloating. -Y-you were not! -There's some-- -So I wanted-- -Uh... Okay. No, you go ahead. Yeah, okay, uh, well, there's something, something I've been wanting to tell you. Oh, right. That, yeah. Remember when we got locked in your room? Sorry, of course you remember that. Okay, when we were talking about... Y-you know how you thought that I looked... like your main character Desmond? The thing is, it's actually the other way around. He looks like me. Wait, what do you mean? My wife, Emily, was a painter. She commissioned her art for all sorts of different jobs. Portraits, brochures, print ads... book covers. I recognized your cover art instantly. I mean, she didn't paint that one, but she was-- -She was the original artist. -Yeah. Yeah, she sometimes used me as inspiration for her... It doesn't matter. I had no idea that book became a series. Your series. Wow. I mean... I don't know, but, wow. -Seems to be the consensus. -I mean... The odds of this... Yeah, I don't even know what, what this is, but past few days, you and I, we've... I know you've... I think I just need a little time to figure out what it means. You know? Yeah. Um... I can only imagine what's going through your head. Thank you for understanding. Well, I better go. I have a few pages still to write. -So... -Of course. Right, right. Uh, Izzi. Merry Christmas. Not yet. I'll see you tomorrow. [instrumental music] I can't do this. I can't write the ending with so much left unsaid. [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] -What? -He says... [indistinct chatter] Tell him you won fair and square. Yeah, well, I did have some help, to be fair. Mm-hmm. -All right. -[laughing] You two make a really good team. You think so? I'm not gonna lie, I had my eye on you since you were back, but, as an old friend, I'm happy for you. -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. -You're the best. Okay. Oh, Izzi came to me with a really good idea after cookie decorating. -Really? About what? -Yeah. Your dad. But don't say anything to him yet because I haven't had a chance to iron out the details, but I think Bob's gonna love it. [footsteps approaching] Izzi! I figured out the ending to my story and I think you're gonna like it. I know I will. And I think I figured out mine, too. -You doin' all right, Izzi? -Yeah, I'm just tired. I think I'm gonna head back and finally finish my book. Oh, okay. -Well, goodnight then. -Goodnight, Bob. -Goodnight, Kacey. -Goodnight.

[laughs] Yeah? Okay. "Once upon a time, a king and his princess, who was very adorable... moved to a new kingdom. The king spent all of his time fixing up his new castle because his heart was broken. And it was the one thing he couldn't fix." -Kacey... -Dad, keep reading. Continue. Okay. Yeah. "The king was sad because a long time ago, he lost his queen. But one day, a beautiful new queen without a king of her own traveled to the kingdom. The king and the very adorable princess fell in love with her, and the king was happy once again. The end." This is beautiful. -That's gorgeous, Kacey. -Thank you. Come here. Hey, hey, where are you going? To get one of Aunt Sarah's Christmas cookies. Kacey, it's 9:00 in the morning. -Okay, get me two. -Me, too, please. Dad... You don't think it's wrong having feelings for someone else? Oh, absolutely not. Especially if it's the right person. And for what it's worth, I kinda think my granddaughter approves. [chuckles] Yeah. Honestly, I didn't think I'd feel this way again. Izzi makes me see things I've never noticed before. When I'm with her, it's like I can breathe again, you know, it's... First time in a long time. But? I guess I'm just scared. -Losing someone again. -I understand, son. Life is gonna bring us bruises, it's unavoidable. But if you see a good jump... you gotta take it. Yeah. ♪ O come all... [Bob] Merry Christmas! Fantastic. Have a great day. Izzi! Merry Christmas. Good morning. -Merry Christmas. -Guess what? I just got off the phone with Jennifer. [sighs] She asked if I would volunteer for the town board. I would oversee all the Christmas activities, and the rest of the year I'd help out with all kinds of Silver Springs events! She said the whole thing was your idea. You are so thoughtful. Hey, wait. W-what, what are you... You're not leaving, are you? -I have to go. -What, so soon? You have to at least stay for Christmas breakfast, right? Like I said, there was going to be some activities I would miss this year. Izzi, I don't understand. I came here to rewrite my book, and I did. It definitely wasn't the ending that I thought it would be, but at least now I know it's finished. I don't mean to pry, but did Matt talk to you? Let's just say I know what I need to know. -What does that mean? -I'm not his person, Bob. I better hit the road before it starts snowing again. Merry Christmas. Drive safe, Iz. -You hungry? -Yeah. I'm so hungry. All right. Hey, you wanna grab us both a plate? Eggs, bacon, all that kid stuff? Hey, double the syrup. -Hey, son? -Yeah. Hey, you seen Izzi? Kinda surprised she's not indulging in the snow-angel-shaped pancakes. -Izzi left, son. -What do you mean she left? Well, she said she was finished with her book, so she was gonna go home. On, no. On Christmas Day? No. [chuckles] Wait, that, it doesn't make sense. Why... Well, she did say a couple of things that were-- Uh, should I make a plate for Izzi? Ah. Turns out she already left, princess. This morning. But I thought she was supposed to spend Christmas with us. Yeah, me, too. Hey, go grab us a-a table, okay? Yeah. [indistinct singing] -What did she say, dad? -Oh. [cell phone ringing] If you're calling to fire me, do it quick. Please put me out of my misery. [scoffs] Merry Christmas to you, too. Sorry. Merry Christmas. [Mila] I was calling about the book, but it feels like we should talk about what on Earth could've possibly dampened your Christmas spirit. No, it's okay, just hit me with the book stuff first. Iz, it's great! -Really? -[Mila] Yes! This version of Desmond has this new depth and vulnerability that makes him feel completely three-dimensional. I'm glad you're happy with it. Uh, just one thing, the last page, Desmond and Catarina don't end up together. I mean, I'm just surprised. And I don't think the publisher will go for it. They want an ever after. They want a happy ending. Maybe that's not what real love is, though. Maybe sometimes it ends with a broken heart. What do you mean "A broken heart?" Are you talking about Matt? You remember when I asked you about the original artist for my books? It turns out it was Matt's wife. Oh! You're kidding. -[Mila] That's-- -Unbelievable? I know. And it seemed to really derail him. Oh. Iz, I'm so sorry. I took your advice, and I tried to open myself up to real love, and then I ended up getting my heart ground down with sandpaper. You told him how you felt? I mean, no, not directly. But you already left? That's it? Okay, Iz, stop the car. You need to hear this. And I don't want you driving when I say it. -Seriously? -Yeah, seriously. -Okay. -Yes. You opened yourself up to the possibility of being with Matt, but then you walked away before you... All you can do is look ahead, aim, take a breath and release. The rest is out of your hands, but at least you took your shot. Wait. Those are my words. I wrote that. That's from Archer's Quiver. Yeah. So take your own advice. [instrumental music] Okay. -Okay? -[Izzi] Yeah. And do me a favor and hold off on that last page. -Copy that. -[Izzi] Thanks.

Did you leave because of what I said last night? I saw you and Jennifer after the Lights Festival. And? And you looked perfect together. And, I mean, clearly she has feelings for you. Why wouldn't she? You're amazing. So you had said all those things about not knowing how you felt, and when I saw you two together-- Izzi, stop. No, I don't have feelings for Jennifer. I have feelings for you. I wish you would've said something. Wish you would've asked me, trusted me. But instead you left. I... I don't know if I can do this. I'm sorry. [Izzi] Matt, wait. Okay.

But my biggest mistake wasn't making Desmond too perfect, it was that I was trying to find someone like him, instead of finding someone who is perfect for me. Matt... I know that being open to real love means being open to all of it, even the hard parts. Izzi, I... I... I got you a Christmas present. -What is it? -Well, open it. [rattles] [chuckling] [gasps] The wobbly doorknob? Well, you taught me how to be sentimental. Squeaky floor wouldn't fit in the box. I... More than that, you opened the door to my heart. I know the book cover threw me for a loop, but this morning I realized it-it's not just a coincidence, it's more than just a coincidence, it's, it's a gift. It's a gift from Emily. She brought us together. You're the one I want, Izzi. You're the one I want, too. I think that's the first time we've actually agreed on something. This is how my book should end. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] I gotta say, I like Matt even better than Desmond Ranes. Plus, he inspired Christmas In The Alps, which is my favorite one yet. And your best-reviewed. Okay, okay, don't get a big head. -Too late. -[chuckles] Kacey, I want you to meet my friend and editor, Mila. -Hi. -Hello. This is a very talented and up-and-coming writer. -Is that so? -And I have a lot of ideas. Well, I think we should step into my office. [Matt chuckles] So what's next for the bestselling novelist and recently-engaged Izzi Simmons? 'Cause I've a few thoughts. -Oh, really? -Well... Maybe the new-and-improved Desmond is a Navy scuba diver in Hawaii. Though, you and your fiance would probably have to do a lot of research. -I like the sound of that. -Yeah. -[instrumental music] -Come on. Yeah. [instrumental music] [music continues]
