THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL A movie inspired by the Andersen story and shot at the Vieux Colombier Studios. A faraway city in the North, on New Year's Eve. In the slums, a miserable shack. "Your shoes are not suited for snow. You should go home." She hasn't sold a single box of matches and is too scared to go back to the shack. Wouldn't it be nice to warm up by the flame of a match? Cold and hungry, she is stymied by hallucinations. "I'm hungry." But suddenly, a killjoy appears. "I have a date with Karen tonight. I am Death." Seeing the pain caused by Death, the young couple escapes to the skies. "How stupid to think you can warm up with matches."
