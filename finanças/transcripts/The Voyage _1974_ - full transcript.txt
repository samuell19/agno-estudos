Good morning. A really nice will! Don Liborio, we thank you. It was truly good on your part to go to such trouble. I offer my condolences, those of my wife and my children, of my brothers naturally, my cousins ​in ​Palermo and all my family. Dear doctor, I understand. - He was a true friend! Mother! Mother! He was so good looking, even until the end! "I, the undersigned Ferdinand Braggi," "of sound mind, recommend my soul to God" "and arrange for the following to be done." "On the day that pleases the Lord to call me to him," "I want my will to be read out." What we are doing right now. "I name as my universal heirs my two beloved sons," "Cesare… and Antonio." "To Rinaldo…," "I leave my gold watch and chain with the rubies." The gold watch and chain with the rubies! - The gold watch! "To the administrator, the land of Venere." To the administrator, the land of Venere. - The land of Venere! "To my friend, Dr. Mascione," "enough money for the construction of a clinic." A clinic! - A clinic! "In bequest to the Mother Superior of the convent St. Mary, Help of Christians," "the money for an orphanage of 20 beds." "I leave it to my far off cousin, Filomena D'Acquisto," "the apartment located in Via Bartolo 18," "already rented at the time to the Castrocane heirs." "To the loyal Clementina, the ruby diamond brooch which belonged to my late wife." Did you hear, Cesare? A clinic! "To Rose, the country cottage where she actually lives." From here on, follow private matters of family which nobody should hear with the real estate or property. I must therefore ask all those present to leave, except the two sons, Cesare and Antonio. You must excuse me. Please, ladies and gentlemen. It's finished. - Nothing for the children? - What nothing? They are the universal heirs. Just gifts for the others. Let's go. - Let's go! And now that we're alone: "As my last wish, I have added to this testament" "a private letter to be delivered at the time of my death" "to my eldest son." Cesare, you are the first born. His will passes into your hands. THE VOYAGE Doctor, what are these spots on this child? Wash him, my daughter. It's raining! It's raining! Water! Water! It comes! It's raining! - How beautiful! Hooray! Good day. Mrs. De Mauro! Good day. Mrs. De Mauro! - Good day, Doctor! Excuse me, Ma'am. I wanted to tell you that Cesare Braggi will come to see you. He needs to talk to you. - Cesare? - Yes, Cesare. When is he coming? Do you know, Doctor? - Today, this afternoon! This afternoon? Then we'll have to put everything in order, Mama. Hurry. Thank you, Doctor! Thank you so much! My Lord, what a mess! How will we do it? Oh, Adriana, my love, you're mixing up the clothes! We haven't finished the work going to Catania. Leave it to me, Mama. I'll sort it out tomorrow. Now let's put everything in place so it'll be nice when he arrives. Even this? - All of it. Take it away. It must be nice here in honor of him. Ah, how exhausting, but it's all in order. My jewel, put on the sky blue dress. - As if I had a choice. Even if I had 12, I'd put on the sky blue. Mama! Mama, it needs some ironing. - OK, leave it to me. What time is it? - 2. - Holy Mary! He said the afternoon because the rich start late. We kiss your hands, Count. Don Cesare. Good evening. - My respects. It's him. Mama, he's here! Stay in your room. When the time comes, I'll call you. Mama! What do you think? Do I look good? - Beautiful, my daughter. Beautiful! Cesare. Ma'am. - Have a seat. Thank you. Sit down. - Thank you. Please. I haven't seen your home for years. I… I was here as a child but maybe you don't remember. What? Of course. Of course, I remember. My poor Pasquale was still alive. He was seen often with your father, the good soul. They were great friends. - Yes, I know. My father admired greatly your husband. My father when dying… left me a letter… It expresses his esteem for your family. For you and your daughter Adriana. If I may, I'll read it. "Adriana De Mauro is particularly dear to me." "because daughter of the colonel of finance Pasquale De Mauro," "who honored me as long as he lived with his friendship" "and allowed me to come to his house." Perhaps you can imagine why I'm here. I have come to ask for your daughter Adriana's hand. It is my father's wish and it is our wish. Yes. I can only add that Adriana will enter our house with all the deep esteem and love she deserves. My brother Antonio will be a good and loyal husband. Antonio? And this is the will of our father. And it is written here in this letter. My brother Antonio will be the best of husbands. - Yes, I'm sure. I'm very honored by this request but… Adriana… I know, Adriana is a very proud girl and is set in her ways. - Indeed. But that's fine. We ask for nothing better. If she agrees to marry my brother, it'll be because she wants to. Certainly. Ma'am, speak serenely with Adriana about it. We'll await the answer. - Let's talk about it now with her! Let's! No, it's better that you speak to her alone calmly. I… I don't want to bother you anymore. - Bother? It's an honor. Adriana! Cesare. Adriana. Adriana… Cesare came with great news. Happy news, my daughter. Yes. As head of the family after the death of our father, it was my duty to come and ask for her hand… …for my brother Antonio. And how much my father desired it, he left written in his will. Antonio? I barely know Antonio. But Caesar…, you understand? No, I don't understand. I don't. I'm sorry. Excuse me, I must go now. Adriana… No! - No? What are you saying, Adriana? No! But don't you realize that you can enter the Braggi House? What do you mean "no"? If I say, then it's no. There doesn't exist a girl in Sicily who wouldn't feel honored to marry a Braggi. And you? - No. Not me. Me! Me! Me! You only know how to say "me"! And me? And the two of us? Won't you think of the future? You said "No" enough: "No" to that lawyer from Palermo, "No" to the Baron LaLoggia! You didn't want that gentleman from Syracuse who was a good man! And even now you want to say "No", because he wasn't the one you dreamed about! No, Mama! No, Mama. No. No! Congratulations! Cesare, congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Congratulations. - Thank you, Don Liborio. Thank you. Thank you. I'll go and visit her soon. As much as I can. - Thank you. At your disposal, Count. This here is Rosa. I'm glad to see you again. Mama used to play. She loved music. That's my grandfather, my grandmother and those are the great-grandparents. They keep one company. What is it, dear? Are you not well? - No, it's nothing. I feel a bit confused. My father always sat here, that was the place of mama… …me over there and here Cesare. Adriana! My love. My love. Adjust the blinds of the dining room. And you fix the tiles in the lady's room. Have you heard? They come back Sunday. What is it? - We've just been told that Mr Antonio and his wife are returning. Return? - Yes, Sir. They arrive on Sunday. Something happened, they should've been away for a month. No, Count, Ercole said they were very well. Only that the lady wished to come home. - Oh, well then… You must bring my papers and books into my study. But isn't your study on the first floor? - No, this is their floor. I had told you. So I want everything upstairs. - Fine, Count, we'll see to it right away. I'm sorry that when they arrive, I won't be here. I must depart tomorrow. Departed? But… - He needed to meet with some clients in Milan. Didn't he say how long he'd be away? Ma'am, you're lovely like a flower! - No, Sir. He said it depends on business. Business! Business! He always calls them that: business! - Why? What do you mean? For the love of God, no one's criticizing! He's free and has no ties. I mean, he has the right to have some amusement. He doesn't have the good fortune to have at his side a precious wife like you. Excuse me. For Mr. Braggi. He's in the salon. Oh, Simona! - Dear, how are you? Well, thanks and you? Thank you. Good evening, Maestro. Good evening. Who was that man? Giacomo Puccini. Good morning. Good morning. - Did you sleep well? Yes, dear. - Good. I'm sorry, Sir, have you heard about the accident? - No, what happened? Read here. CALABRIA AND SICILY DEVASTATED BY EARTHQUAKE My God, it's terrible! - Cesare, what is it? A telegram form, please. - But tell me what happened. A disaster! Adriana! Come in, Antonio. - Adriana! Come in! Dear, get up. Cesare has arrived! Cesare? - Yes! I haven't said anything to him yet. I want us both to tell him. Expecting a child? Yes. I'm happy, Antonio. What wonderful news. From now on, you must only think about being calm, Adriana. Thank you, Cesare. I will. You are right to say so. Here before we've always been peaceful. But Adriana is so sensitive, I was worried about her. The tragedy of the earthquake shocked her very much and the state she is in… You weren't here, you couldn't know. Hour by hour, terrible news would arrive. A true tragedy. He's born! A boy! A boy! Beautiful! He's fine, fine. And Mr. Cesare? - Upstairs, Doctor. I know the way, thank you. Oh, it's you, Doctor. I saw him. Such a child! But… What is it? But that girl, Adriana… Now that it is passed, she should… she should be watched over. Is she weakened? Exhausted? I found her a bit a lost, anguished. After a son, mothers celebrate. They quickly forget the great suffering they underwent. But she threw herself down. Down. And the reason? The reason… In my opinion, I'd say… it is the heart. The heart? - It's a little weak. What does Antonio say? I just wanted to tell you for now. If you know, I'll feel more at ease. Yes, it's right that I know but then… I'm traveling here, traveling there. I'm very little here. And I'll be here less and less. Look, Mama, the train! Look how nice it is! "For dear Nandino for his fifth birthday." "From his Uncle Cesare." Uncle Cesare! Uncle! - Nandino! Uncle! Uncle! You've grown! How heavy you are! Adriana… - Welcome back, Cesare. At home they told me you were here in the country. It's Antonio who wanted it so. Guess what this is? - Skittles! No! Cold. A spinning top? - Very cold. A teddy bear? - No! You're freezing cold! What is it? I want to know! Oh, my jewel! You must guess. That thing you look inside of? - Now, you're close. Let's see. Let's see what it is. What can it be? What may it be, Nandin? What can it be? Let us see. What a nice device! Look! Cesare, that's absurd. Nandino is too small to use it. I'm not too small. Come here! Come here! With this you make the photos, see? Look through here and do the click, click and you can photograph… mama, papa, eh… Clementina, me… In short anything you want. - Click! Click! Yes. Are you happy? - Let's go. So I see in order to make my wife and son happy, I must have my brother here. It's nice to be good for something, no? Uncle, who are they? What are they doing? They are soldiers. They're going to Libya. Why so many? What are they going to do? They're going to war. What is war? A very bad thing. Then why does the band play? Why do they sing? - In order not to think about it. Where is Libya? - Oh, it's very far. So far from here that you can't see it. When will they return? - Some will not return. Why? Will they stay there? Yes, they'll stay forever. Look! An automobile! Nice, eh? Say goodbye to the sea! At home you won't see it anymore. - Bye, sea! Uncle, is it the same sea that's at Palermo? - Yes, the same. Look! Look at our mountains! Give me your hat! Are you tired? - Me? No. Look at the curve there is now! Can I sound the horn? - Sound it! Are you afraid? - Not me. - I am, a lot. Look at that cliff! Look! Mama! Mama! Papa! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! - What is all this? Jesus! Mary! Is that the way you come from Palermo? - Mama, I saw the sea. I saw the harbor with ships. And there were soldiers who went to Libya. He said that Libya is far away. - It truly is. And what's that? - Antonio! Look at the nice surprise! You like it? - Yes! It's yours! A gift for you! For me? - Of course! Don't go so fast, Cesare! Are you insane? Insane? We're at 35 kph. With this car, you can reach 50. - What? Hey, listen, is it hard to drive? No! Very easy. You must learn. You'll do well. How did the idea come to you for this gift? This amazes me. I'd never have thought of buying a car. But you never hesitated for an instant. To each his own. - Exactly. What do you mean? - I'd like to be more like you. Why? Maybe you're complaining about who you are? No, I'm not complaining but the problem is that each of us puts out what's inside and unfortunately I communicate it to everybody near me, my family. Stop being so complicated, Antonio! Don't you realize that you have… have an affectionate wife, and a… beautiful child. And now you have a car which you can play around in. What more do you want? You… then you really believe that I should be satisfied? Contented? Huh? - Tell me. "Contented", you say? Not only contented but happy! With a heart full of happiness! Without such a sad face, but with happy eyes. Ah, you're right. But you'll see, I'll change. I feel different already. Listen… one more thing. What do you think of Adriana? - Adriana? Adriana is an extraordinary woman and happy. Maybe you don't notice it? Just look at her, hear how she speaks… How she behaves. Don't you ever look at her? Don't you see it? Yes, she's happy. Even a blind man would see you're right. You're always right, Cesare. You give me a certainty I can never find myself. Leave it to you. Teach me how to drive, eh? I want to become as good as you! I can do it, right? - Of course you can. You'll become better than me, believe me. - I'll take your word. Good, that's what I like to see. Every morning when you look into the mirror, you must say out loud, "Life is magnificent. I'm lucky, I must be happy." They'll think I'm crazy! From now on, you must always seem a bit crazy. Go on, say it! Like you were before the mirror. Come, go on! What's the matter? Are you scared? - Why should I be scared? Then say it! Let me hear it. Come, go on! Say it! I'm lucky! I'm happy! Life is beautiful! What do you think? - Much better. What are you two doing? Children's games? Yes, just children's games! Ah, well done! Nandino! Nandino! You come play too! Come play. Unbelievable! You think? - How far can man's inventive genius go? Then it's a promise? A promise. I'm staying. I'm not moving from Milan anymore. They took him away just now. Right… - I'm sorry, Cesare. We notified you too late. But it was all so, so… Where's Nandino? - At my mother's. Cesare…, I don't know what to do. It's terrible and my mind is all confused. If you hadn't come, I… Now I'm here. You others come down and await my orders. I am lucky. I'm happy. Life is beautiful. Run or we'll be late! Now go to school. But if I don't like school? What will we do, Uncle Cesare? Not like it? You'll like it very much. You'll make friends with your schoolmates, you'll learn to read, learn to write… Fine, I'll go. But you must promise me not to leave ever again. OK, I promise. Go on. Bye. Bye! - Bye, mama! Bye! So, how did it go? Was he scared? No. He didn't cry? - Absolutely not. He was less nervous than you. I couldn't even accompany him to school. Luckily you were there. Thank you. Thank you, Cesare. - Some things I don't understand. Which things? - The rules, the customs. Our traditions are all absurd things, useless. What are you saying? You know how much I suffered and still suffer for Antonio's death. But certain exterior manifestations I disapprove of. Pain measured by the yardstick that only cares about form. I don't understand that. You couldn't accompany your child to school this morning. You must stay at home, in the dark. Not even the sun must come into the house of mourning. - Cesare! I don't like to see you locked up in here. But I'm fine this way. I've Nandino. He's my life. Nandino is everything to me. Of course. Goodbye. Will you come back tonight? - I hope to be back while Nandino's still awake. He happily falls asleep when you're there. Where is the lady? - She went out on the terrace, Count. On the terrace? - Yes, Sir. Adriana! Adriana! Cesare, I'm up here. I'll be right down. No, I'll come up myself. Nice! It's lovely here. There's plenty of light. And no one can see me. Listen… May I say something to you? - Of course. Excuse me but… you're selfish. Selfish? - That's right. Why? You're young, vivacious… You have a child who wants to have a young and vivacious mama. No. No. I'm not so sure of being young. Or being vivacious. That's only because you insist on not living. On remaining shut up in this house. Like a convent. And always with that eternal black dress on. Don't you realize you've lost weight, become pale… You're wasting away. Adriana, you're still young and beautiful. Cesare, please… - Don't think, I say this to console you or pay you compliments. Let's go down now. - No. First you must promise me one thing. I beg you… Promise me… that you'll take care of yourself. Look! A button is falling off. So I'm the one neglecting myself, right? - It's Clementina who's neglecting me. Let's go down, I'll sew it. Clementina says that it'll definitely rain tomorrow. Her bones are a barometer. Thank you. - For what? I'm making a run to Palermo, I'll be back this night. - Yes, Count. A good trip. - Goodbye. He only goes now from the House to the storehouse and back again. He's just like a father. - I bet he'd like to be the husband too. Don't blaspheme! Or the spit will return from heaven back to your face! The widow cries for the dead but thinks of the living. - The things you say! Of course I could have written but I prefer to meet you. I didn't want this to look like a flight. I never thought we come to this. Thank you. After the death of my brother, I couldn't abandon the interests I have in Sicily, my family. Forgive me, Simona. I never wanted anybody to suffer on my account. The typical selfishness of men. It's not easy for me, Cesare, to break with a man like you. I've only beautiful and dear memories. And you? Put the horses inside, Violetto. - Right away, Don Cesare. Go get some rest. - Good night, Count. Call Saro, please. - Saro! Good morning, Ma'am. - Morning, Saro. Take charge of the luggage. - Please. Take first the two small cases then the big one. Be careful with the big one, eh? - Alright. Grandma! Grandma! - Are you happy to see me? Mama. My beautiful daughter! Now that I'm here, you must be in complete repose. Repose? I have plenty of that. Look what's coming. - Thank you. - Dessert is coming! Dessert! It is not for you, Nandino. It's for grandma to celebrate her coming. - Thank you, Cesare. But Nandino must take the first slice in my honor. - Mama must take the first. Go on, Nandino. Today Clementine will begin with you. Come here! I'll cut it for you. - A huge slice! - OK. Excuse me. What is it, Adriana? Do you feel ill? Adriana! - No, it's nothing. I'll be right back. Good morning, Count. - Now then, speak frankly, Doctor. To me she's like a daughter. Yes, I know. I'm asking what can be done? She needs a consultation. - A consultation? Let's do it right away. Who can we turn to? I think a decision must be made to go to a specialist in Palermo. Palermo? Then it's dangerous? Excuse me, Count. - Not now, later. Dangerous? I didn't say that. But serious yes. A serious matter. We need to do a thorough diagnosis without further delay. I with my laboratory knowledge alone can't do it. We need an authority. That's why I say Palermo. No, no. Absolutely not! Palermo? But it's an absurd idea! No, it's not at all absurd. Rather it'll best to leave immediately. - Impossible. Impossible! - Listen to Cesare, dear. If he says it's necessary… Come, Adriana, be reasonable. It's for your good. It'll be two or three days. The time to go and return. Just a precaution. No, I don't want to! All that trip… I'd become ill in earnest. No. Please, leave me in peace. You must. I already decided for you. Please… Why do you torment me? Wonderful! What wonderful things! Stupendous! Do you like them? - Magnificent! Mama, are you ready? Be good, Nandino! You can't come in now! - Hurry up, Mama! How splendid you'll look, Ma'am! These are all the latest fashion. - You call this the fashion? You can't even tell what goes in the front! And how does one deal with all these hooks? And it's so heavy… - That's the latest style today, dear. They wear all this extravagant stuff? Open up! Let me see, Mama! Mama! One minute, Nandino! - I'll go open it else that rascal will knock down the door. Mommy, you're so beautiful! No, please. Impossible. I feel like in costume. Can I come in? It suits you truly well. I feel like I'm naked. - Let me see. I've never seen you so beautiful. Turn around. Turn. That's it, a little profile. You saw the hats? Don't they look like baskets? - It's the fashion. How can you put it on your head? It's enormous. All's well? - Yes, thank you. To go by train is fun? - Yes, very. Strange, as soon as I went on this trip, I started forgetting everything. Maybe that's why this trip is more than necessary. Look at that town from afar. I was there. That's San Salvatore, it's been around for more than 300 years. - 300 years! That mountain over there is called Punta Raisi. When we were boys, Antonio and I climbed to the top. Are you OK? - Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry. This way, dear. Welcome, Mr Braggi. - Good day. - Take Mr Braggi's luggage. 118, your usual room. No. The lady is Mrs Braggi, my sister-in- law. 2 single rooms, please. Excuse me. This way, Mr. Braggi. - Thank you. DR NICOSIO CARDIOLOGIST During the visit, your brother-in-law shall wait here, Ma'am. This way. Don't worry. Please remove your hat and jacket, Ma'am. Ma'am, when did you first notice the symptoms of this trouble? A few years ago. - Do you have children? - Yes, a boy of five years. I see, just one. Tell me, was it a difficult birth? Yes, very difficult. Tell me, Doctor. What is it? It's often a bad habit of patients to come see their doctor a few years overdue. Cesare. The lady must have had some hints, no doubt. She must have felt something long ago. How is she now? There is nothing more pernicious than silence in problems of health. Medicine can help the sick… …provided that the sick help the medicine, obviously. She'll need this medicine. The lady will take it in moments of distress. In this case I believe there's nothing else that can help. Excuse me, Doctor. You said that we were wrong to let so much time pass. And you were right. But now we are ready to do anything. Whatever that can help. Keep to this prescription, I repeat. It is the only medicine that can help her. You really don't want a carriage? - I feel like walking. Well, that smell of ether in the doctor's office dazed me. I didn't know that Palermo was just so full of life. It seems impossible. - Adriana, don't do that. Sorry. Don't cry. We agreed that this visit was necessary. So that… Maybe I was wrong. I shouldn't have forced this torture on you. These city doctors never say anything clear, so that way they're never wrong. But I'm weeping for joy. I owe to you all that I see. It's the first time. The city, these gardens, everything. Ma'am, will you give back my ball? - Yes, sweetie. When do we return? Let's go today. Tonight. There must be a train. - No, you're too tired from the trip. What's the hurry? - I want to go home. I've already given you too much trouble. - Trouble? Look, Adriana… My "trouble", as you call it, will last until the day I know you're cured. So you must return to being healthy and soon. You really believe… that I can be cured? I'm absolutely sure of it. You must be certain too. Listen, I'm going to send a telegram. You go up in the meantime. Please, be quick. It'll be very quick. It's a question of urgency. - But this is not the visiting hour. No matter, I'm coming in all the same. Tell him that Mr. Braggi wants to see him. What is it, Mr. Braggi? - Sorry to disturb you, Doctor. You may go. Yes, Mr. Braggi? - Today, you didn't state your diagnosis to me or my sister-in-law. It's never been my habit to tell the sick the entire truth. I'm not sick, Doctor. Since you insist, Mr. Braggi, know that your sister-in-law's is very serious. Beyond any remedy. The attacks will repeat again. They will follow their course. They'll multiply unfortunately. Only a life of extreme caution could have been able… But now… it's too late. Adriana, can I come in? Come in, Cesare. It's open. Good morning. - Good morning. Adriana? - Yes? Today we're leaving for Naples. Naples? I want to hear another doctor. I already made the appointment. No, I want to go home right away! Listen well, Adriana, we're going to Naples. We'll go to another doctor. And if he won't do, we'll find another. You must be reasonable. - I am reasonable, Cesare, believe me. I feel it's better to go home. And what about Naples scare you? The distance? Now I'm afraid of everything, Cesare. Take me home. Don't make me cross the sea. Don't force me, please. I know we must do so. I understand you, but I don't agree. I can't. - Do you really understand me? Yes. But when you have crossed the sea, as you say, later on… you'll realize it was the right thing to do. It's a sad separation but necessary. I must confess something, Cesare. In the train, I was bit scared of you. I know. I read it in your eyes. They have no secrets from me. I've never had anything to hide. My fears, my sufferings are gone. I forgot them. Have a seat, Ma'am, please. It's done. You may get dressed, Ma'am. Maybe it was a bit tiring? - No, it was very gentle. For the time being, I won't need you. Mr. Braggi? Come in. This way. Tell me, do you have children? Yes, one. - And how old is he? Five years old. Any other pregnancies? Abortions? - No, Doctor. There must have been something during the pregnancy or the birth. Some fatigue or devious process of infection… that caused a myocardium expansion and the resulting dilution of the right ventricle. Now we realize it years later and unfortunately suffer the consequence. Oh, please, don't be alarmed, Ma'am. "Don't be alarmed", he says. - Trust and intelligence. That's the only medicine that works. Know what you can do and what you can't do. My lady, it's a question of mode of life. It's not necessary to follow a diet. Walk, walk whenever you want. Travel. Of course, don't go climbing mountains but what counts is to live. And don't live under a bell jar. You're young, you have a future, you have a child… So live, my dear lady. But don't get overexcited. Every emotion for you will be a blow. And you must help her. She must absolutely not see nor hear what can disturb her. You must not agitate yourself, even while speaking. That may be dangerous. Distance yourself. That's what you must do. Distance yourself. Understand? Some bad news? Spare her and take care of it. Don't read any telegrams. Let others read them. As for everything else which is the most important thing in life, do what you feel like doing freely, with confidence and courage. And I can say, with love. Before this magic word love, I bow, too, in the name of medicine. Gambling with no delay with deeds and not words. And then you'll see how will come true all that you desire. Stepping on the bridge in the evening, I gaze at the river. And I see the whole sky in its reflection. I see the moon in the sky which illuminates. I see the thousand stars sparkling. How that riverbed draws me to it! I'd like to die so as not to suffer but the heart rebels. You say, "Why? So many there are whom you'll find more beautiful." Who wants to have luck with women, must never show love. Finally! I've never seen you laugh like that. - And how about you? Shall we go? - Yes, thank you. Lady! Lady! Lady! Ma'am, give us something to eat. - Ma'am, how beautiful you are. What dears! Give them some money. - Fine. Thank you! Thank you! The carriage is ready, Excellency. Get in, please. Where to, Sir? - Trot, go on! Love, my love, I'm so happy! I love you! Let us forget everything that… that we've been through. The last morning train to Palermo leaves at 1:10. It arrives at Villa San Giovanni at 7:35 tomorrow. It crosses the straight and immediately finds the connection for Palermo. I forgot the gift for Nandino. The first leaves in the afternoon at 3 and arrives at St. Euphemia at 4. You'll be Palermo at 8:52 tomorrow night. Did you send the telegram to my mother? - No, not yet. There's another one at 5, perhaps more convenient. Box lunches! In the cars, gentlemen! In the cars! We're leaving! - I'll go find seats. Carry on the luggage. It's good here. Adriana! Are you sick? Don't you want to leave? - No! I don't want to go back. Let's go away. Let's go far away. The two of us, love. You want to, Cesare? - Yes, but I never had the courage. Where are you going? The luggage! You know, it's almost like… like I opened my eyes for the first time. All the other wonderful places you brought me: Florence, Ravenna… They didn't exist, they weren't there. I saw only you. You told me, "Look." And I looked. But around me was nothing. Only you. - And now? - Now it's different. I not only see just you, but all those beautiful things. It's a wonderful feeling, Cesare. I feel alive. Can you understand me? Certainly. Adriana… Will you marry me? I want to marry you. My love! I wanted to say it for a long time but I was afraid that you… It's impossible at home. God knows how much I want it but… No. You're only saying it because… - Because I love you. Because it's possible. It's right. And both of us want it. The hotel is on the right. My God, how beautiful you are, love. Assassination in Sarajevo! Special Edition! Special Edition!

Adriana… - Dear… Still awake? I cannot sleep. I'm afraid to fall asleep. Afraid? Sleep is like death. I feel too alive to sleep. Don't worry. You'll find me next to you… every time you wake up. Always. For all my life. No, Cesare, don't close it. But you can't sleep with the light. - I like the light. I don't want to stay in the dark. Cesare? Do you know that last night I had a dream? I was with you in a church and nobody was there. We were kneeling side by side. We were getting married, right? - Yes, maybe. I was squeezing your hand tightly and I thought, "Cesare loves me." "Now I know." - Cesare has always loved you. And you've always known that. Ultimatum from Austria to Serbia! - The Gazette! - Ultimatum! Special Edition! - The Gazette! - Ultimatum from Austria to Serbia! It's from my mother? - Your mother? How does she know we're here? I told her we were coming here when I spoke to her from Florence. According to Dr Simone, anything exciting must first go through me. Yes, you're right. I won't, you read it. "Dear Adriana and dear Cesare, excuse me if…" "I disturb you with this letter. I must write you that…" What happened? Tell me. Nothing. It's only that to read it, one would need a magnifying glass. Her handwriting is so small. She says… that we should return. No. Please, read.

I'll tell everybody. I'll shout it! - Yes. I agree to marry you with all my heart. I want to be your wife. Yes. I want… want to be your wife. The phone call? - It'll come soon. They'll tell me. I'll go with you. I want to speak too. - Absolutely not. It's better you rest. I'll talk to your mother. I'll tell you everything afterward, word for word. How will you tell her? In the simplest manner. Trust me. Do not fear. I trust you. And I am not afraid. I beg you, tell her… I'm the luckiest woman in the world. And I'm so happy in loving you so much. Come in.

We must only think of her now. Don't you understand? Cesa…! - No! No! Cesa…! Cesa…! Ces…! Adriana! Adriana, my love! Adriana! I have waited for you… …always my love. Always… No!
