If you're asking what I remember before that night. Before that night there is nothing. A place without shape or form. Like dreamless sleep. And what do you remember from that night? That night. That night. I suppose that's the night I was born. - So you wake up, no idea of who you were, who you are and nothing since then? - No. And, you know, it was difficult at first but I got a lot of support now. People who love me. - Well, it's a little more fascinating than that. Would you mind sharing with my audience your, uh, your gift. - I have a knack for languages. - I'd call it more than a knack. How many languages do you speak? - About 37, fluently. - 37 languages and you just knew them. Sorry. Yes, strangely enough it was the one thing that I was able to recall. Most of the languages just seemed to already be there as in, I could speak them in my head. But some I learned. - Hm. Well if you're just joining us, I'm sitting down with John Hutton. Eight years ago he surfaced with no identification and no idea of who he was. Since then he has earned two PhDs. One in philology and one in forensic language studies and he is currently an adjunct professor at UCLA. Now you wrote a book, it is called, The Spoken Thread. Now in this book you concur that language is what connects humans-- - What connects human beings by our very instinct to communicate with each other. And with ourselves. To be heard, to be understood, is to be accepted. That's the purpose of our very existence. - Okay, I know, I know, I'm fighting the cliche here. But a toast is in order. To John and to Rachel. A very brilliant interview with a very brilliant young man. - And an equally brilliant book I might add. - You may. And I ain't that young. Oh. No, seriously, well done. You've done the university quite proud. - To John. To John. - Mm. - Mm. My turn. - Oh God. - Am I not allowed to say anything about my best friend? - Don't your clients give you enough attention? - Being a private detective is a lonely job. May I? - You may. - Eight years ago when I too was a younger man. I'm still on the force, my first job as a detective, my first case was yours. All I had to do was find out who this guy is and get him back home. Simple enough, right. Wrong. Nobody wanted to claim this dude. But he didn't give up. No, seriously, you and me man, we hunted high and low. Every lead, every agency, we were like Crockett and Tubbs. But in the end, we came up with dick. - Carl! - Oh, sorry, came up with nothing. - Well, not exactly nothing. - Oh yeah, well. You got to marry my sister, my bad. But here's one thing that still bugs me. - Here it comes. - Who would leave a perfectly good white boy in a park like that? - Well, you said you were gonna find me my home. And you most certainly did. - To John. My best friend. To John. - What about dreams? - Excuse me? - Well surely you must dream of something from your past. Some little clue as to where you came from. - I don't dream. - No? - No. - That's not exactly true, John. You dream, sometimes. What about the bunnies? - Bunny rabbits? - Now that's quite a cipher. - No, it's nothing. - What are they doing? - What? - Rabbits in your dreams? Daddy, Daddy! - Oh, speaking of bad dreams. - Oh, I'll go. - Oh, no, no, no, you sit. She called for me. Plus, you have done more than enough tonight. So please, entertain our guests, I'll be right back. Oh, where's Jordan. Hiding. - Hiding huh, from what? The monsters. - Monsters, huh? - Yes. They're under the bed again? - No. - Hm. Closet? - No. - He's running out of places to hide. Not those monsters. - No? What kind of monsters? - A bad guy. - Bad guys? - Henry at school says there's bad guys. Real bad guys. - Hm. - He says they live in cages for doing bad things. - Hm, well, there are good people and bad people in the world and sometimes the bad people need to live away from the good people. - He said some were so bad they were called monsters. - Well, those people aren't here now, are they? Mommy and Daddy keep you safe, right? Tell you what. What if, I left the hallway light on? Extra bright. - Extra bright. Okay. I love you bunches and bunches and bunches. Sweet dreams angel. What? - I'm just lookin'. - Mm-hmm. That's my line. - Good artists borrow. Great artists steal. - So you're an artist now? - Come over here for a second. - Hm? - Yeah. There's something. This thing. - Mm, mm. What was that for? - That's for being a great father. - Mm. And that one? - For being a great husband. - Hm. And that? - That one was for me. - Hm. Now the jury is still out on the amount of dorsal consonants when concerning the Proto-Indo-European phonic system. But it is a held belief that pronunciation was as plain velar, uvular and labialized velur. Yes, labialize, it's pretty cute I know. Anyway, I do agree with this up to a point, however-- All right we'll pick this up next time. But we are moving into resonance on Friday, people. Office hours are posted for those who need me. - I'm impressed. - Can I help you? - So you're the language guy. - I'm sorry? - I'm the numbers guy. It's funny how they spread that around, you know. - Yeah, I'm uh, not really following you here. - We're different, right? - Okay, I have to be going. - No, no, wait, John. Just a minute. - Who are you, how do you? - Eight years ago, I wake up, Fort Meyers, Florida. On a park bench, right? - Okay. - No, no, fucking wait. Just wait. See, I got no clue who I am either. Cold fuckin' blank. But you know what? I can do something special. Just like you. But different. Numbers, math, I can do some serious fuckin' math. - Okay, I'm gonna call security. - No wait! That's, ah, you said you can speak 37 languages. That's bullshit. You can speak hundreds of them. You just won't tell them that. 'Cause you don't want them to think that you're freak. - What do you want? - I want to help you. Help myself. If I still can. - Look, if you need money, I don't-- - I am not a bum! I can do calculations in my head that would fucking break a super computer. You know what that means? It means that we're not just some fuckin' random head case. This was done on purpose. We, we were made to be this way. And not just us. There are others. Look, I don't know what you're talking-- - That took funding, planning, procedure, fucking surgeries, black lights, white rooms. Hell, fucking black lights, white rooms, black lights, white room, black lights, white rooms. - Okay, hey, hey, calm down. - Are you fucking listening to me? - Professor Hutton? Is everything okay? - Yeah. It's okay. - My name's Lucas, you'll find me here. I'll show you. One Mississippi, two Mississippi. Daddy, no peeking. - Oh, you know what, you're right, I forgot the rules. I forgot the rules, I'm sorry. Let's try this again. And three Mississippi. Four Mississippi, five Mississippi, I hope you're hiding. Six Mississippi, seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi, nine Mississippi, 10 Mississippi, here I come! Where is Jordan, where did you go? She is so sneaky. Is she is, oh, oh I think I smell her. Oh, yep I do. I think she's right over here, I think, yeah. Hey, honey? Jordan, sweetie? - We should have your blood work back in a few days. But it's nothing that raises any red flags for me. I'm gonna chalk up your fainting spell to exhaustion and low blood sugar. - But, I'm not tired. - Stress can take its toll in many ways. But not to worry, Mr. Hutton, you're a very healthy man. And lucky too. You know, you could very easily dislodged your chin implant when you landed face down. - My what? - Your chin implant. It's rather elegant work, very natural. You know, I have this interest in facial reconstruction-- - But, I don't have any scars. - Well, they run through the mouth, under the gum line, practically invisible. - Wait, you're not aware of this? Yeah, the name is uh-- - Hey. - Hey, is everything okay? - I'm fine. Yeah, no, I'm fine. All right, where's Jordan. - She's at my mom's. - Okay. - What happened? - Nothing, just. - Nothing. - They said I needed to eat more. - And that's it. - Yeah. Hello? Lucas? - We're just like them, John. We're just like them. - Lucas, you don't need that. - Those cages, you remember? The rabbits from the cages? - Lucas. - They all end this way, for us. For us. - Can you just put the gun down? Lucas just put the gun down, okay. We can get you some help. - It all ends this way. - Please, you can just-- - Like those rabbits. For us. No! Oh my, oh my. - And you had no idea who this man was. Mr. Hutton? - Uh, no. - What about last name? - No. - So why'd you go over there? - I, uh, he said that he could help me. - Help you with what? - To tell me where I was from. - So this Lucas guy just shows up and now you're buddies. Are you sure there isn't something else? - Like what? - I don't know, you know, maybe he was, shakin' you down. You know, maybe, maybe you didn't like what he was selling. You know, maybe this is something you should talk about with us, now. Before it's too late. - What, are you suggesting that I had-- - No, no, we're just talkin' here. - Sorry to interrupt you boys. - No, no, it's just, ah, getting interesting. - Well, don't let me stop ya. - You a lawyer now too, Carl? - Depends, Franca. Does my brother-in-law need a counselor? - Oh no, I think we have what we need. You know, John, you have my card. So I'd stick close to home til we sort this thing out. - Come on, buddy. Let's get you home. - Well what the hell were you thinking, John. Christ, I mean, you almost. - Rachel, please. He knew things! About me. - Such as? - What I can do. - You went on public radio, you told half the world about your life. About the languages, John. You practically opened the door for any psycho to come walking in. - He knew the truth. - The truth? - That I can speak hundreds of 'em. - We agreed that you wouldn't tell anybody about that. - I didn't. But he knew. He said he just woke up out of the same darkness eight years ago. He said he, Christ he was so far gone, man. - Stop, just listen to me. This man was a very troubled person. - What if he had the answers? - What if he didn't? Do you remember what I told you all those years ago? When you hit the wall with this? You're lucky because of what? - Because you don't have to fight with your past. You don't have one. I know. I know you and Carl had it rough growing up. But at least you know where you came from. - Promise me you won't do anything like this again, okay? - I promise. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - They're just like us, John. Just like us. Out of the cages. Right, Johnny? - You don't go in! Try not to throw up this time. - Fuck you. Move quick. What are we looking for? Anything that rat may have left behind. Especially papers, notes. - Notes? - Just fill the bag. - This place is fuckin' feral. This is disgusting. - Shit. Hey, check this out. - Another Picasso. I'll take care of it, you check under the bed. - You go! I call police now! - Want me to uh? - No, no need. Let's go. We're going. Thank you. - This is extraordinary. Where did you say you got this again? - So it's for real? Ah, the math I mean. - Oh, the level of computation here is off the charts. Really. - How so? - Well, he's working through theorems in ways that mimic the most advanced computing algorithms I've ever seen. But he's doing it with a certain signature. His approach is organic, it's creative. It's brilliant. I mean, this person, whoever he is, he's a genius, John. There's one thing that was odd. It was random to me at least. - Odd? - Yeah, near the back here there was a page stuck to another one. With a list of names. There's your name right there. This guy a friend of yours? - Yeah. Somethin' like that. - I want to take this to the dean of the mathematics department, I think it should get in front of some, hey, this should be published. - Thanks so much for your help, but I really need to run. - John. Michael Carnes genius. - For Michael Carnes, music has become a second language, a way to connect with the world that he has no memory of, prior to being found wandering the woods outside of Olympia seven years ago. - I still don't know who I am. But the music has definitely helped. It's helped me fit in. It was just there, I could feel how to play the instrument before even touching it. I can't explain it. - And a tragic follow up to this story, Michael was found dead in his apartment in an apparent suicide earlier this year after succumbing to what friends called a severe bout of depression. This kind stranger will be missed. - No, no. - Hello? - Mrs. Lawrence? Who's this? - This is John Hutton. I was hoping I could ask you a few questions about your husband, Darin. Ma'am? - I've nothing to say about him. - A linguistics conference, in New York? - Yep. Vassar. It's upstate. - I know where Vassar is, John. It's a little late notice, don't you think? - Yeah, you know, Graves thinks it's gonna be good publicity for the book. And for me. - A bit of a heads up would have been nice. - I promise, I'll text you all the information once I get to the airport, okay. Hey, date night when I come back? - Yeah, sure. - Just you and me, promise. - Can I help you? - Mrs. Lawrence? I'm John Hutton, we spoke on the phone the other night. About your late husband. - I told you I had nothing to say about him. - No, no, I know and I'm sorry, but. But no, no, no, please. Mrs. Lawrence. I know about Darin about his condition and, and I just need to. Please, Mrs. Lawrence, what happened to him, was he sick? I know Darin had an ability, a talent that made him different, special and, uh. I'm different too. Please. Thank you. - Darin lived at the halfway house near the diner where I worked. He would come in all the time and he would always order the same thing. I guess we kind of hit it off 'cause a year later we were married. He had a quiet way about him, an easy way. I could always tell when he was here when I came home 'cause now it's just, it's too quiet. Uh, he fainted just out of nowhere. And then headaches. Bad ones. I, uh, I took him to the hospital but they said he was fine and they sent us home. Then nosebleeds, scary ones. Uh, then he said he was tired and I helped him to bed. And then the next morning I found him in the barn, he was just, hanging. Do you want to see what made Darin so special? He said he'd never even been to a museum. Never even picked up a paintbrush. He just knew how to do it, like painting was-- - Like it had always just been there. Did he talk to you about his dreams? The rabbits. - He did that one right before he. I could tell he was agitated by it, like it bothered him somehow. Right after he died these two guys came to the house. They said they were art dealers. They went in to look at Darin's paintings. But something seemed off about them so I told them to leave. I don't know what that part is. You okay? - I'm fine. - How long? The fainting. - A few days. - Mr. Hutton, I don't presume to know you but if you are like my husband, you'd be better off praying for your own salvation. - Cheers? So what did you want to talk to me about? - What if I told you there were others like me? - Others, like professors? - Other men who just woke up, no ID, no memories. - I'd say it's not all that uncommon. - But not just that. All of us had special abilities. Like in the same way that I can do languages they could do music, mathematics, all at really advanced levels. - Had, as in past tense. My honest opinion? On a bullshit scale, I'd say it's up there. - Yeah. - Where's all this coming from? - You know what? Forget it. Sometimes, I, you know. I'm gonna take a leak. - Oh my God. - John, let me in. - Hold on a second. Goddammit. - John. Open the door. Open the door! What's going on in here, when did you get home. Oh Jesus. - Yeah, yeah, I, uh, just spilled something, I was just cleaning it up. I can get it tomorrow. Let's just, let's go to bed. It's fine. Oh yeah, okay. Oh my, we've never done that. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, you want me to bark like a dog? Ruff. Oh yeah. Put it in my hand. - You see this? New wireless mic, talkin' some NSA type shit. Long range, no detection. Okay, I get caught up in my work sometime. Where'd you tear off to anyway last night. - What if we were looking in the wrong place? - Come again? - It's easier if I show you. - I don't know what to say to that, man. - Now, I tried to record everything that I could see. Every symbol, every tattoo. I think these can provide us with some answers. - Answers? - Yes! Now, I think these all are affiliated with some sort of gang, so if we can just try to-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, man. You want to back up a minute. - We need to track these down, Carl. - Look you come into my office with this. And expect what? For me to be all cool and shit. Goddamn, John. - This was planned, Carl. - Planned? - Yes, Lucas said that we were wiped clean, started over. Now, I think someone did that to me. - Lucas? Now you're taking the word of some crazy whack job. - Don't do that to me, Carl. You know I am not crazy. - Okay, you got some tags on you, and they are severely fucked up. - Yeah. - But you want to know what kind of sick bastard you may have been? Do I even have to explain this to you. - You said you'd help me find out who I am. That's all I'm asking from you here. - No, no, I don't want to know. Neither should you. Whoever, whatever you were. It ain't gonna help to find out now, trust me. - I need to know, Carl. I need to know who I was. - Go home. Be with your family, get right with yourself and forget about this shit, okay? - These names? They're all gone. I am the only one left. Now I'm gonna find out who I am, with or without you. - Mommy, I can't eat any more. - One more carrot. - Mommy? - Come on, one more. Like a good little bunny. Not hungry? John? - Hm? Oh. No. It's great. Hello? Is anyone there? Hello. - Meet me in my office in an hour. I thought about what you said. I promised to help you, so I will. - Thank you. - Don't thank me yet. You ain't gonna like this. I reached out to a Fed contact that owes me a favor. Had him run several of these through the database. They belong to a chapter of a neo-Nazi biker gang. One of several Aryan groups. They move a lot of meth, guns, girls. All the way from Idaho through Arizona. All these guys are hardcore felons. Do you hear what I'm sayin'? When we looked into you, we ran you through the system. Prints, DNA. If you had any record whatsoever, it would have popped up. - So what does this mean? - It means, maybe you're right. Maybe someone went through a lot of trouble to erase your ass. I mean I've only seen this type of shit in deep cover witness protection stuff. That's something we're never gonna know. - What is this one? - EVL? Maybe some type of inside code, a nickname. - So that's it? - All right, my guy said there's a club house outside of canyon country. Neutral territory for all the gangs. Some of these Aryan guys come through there from time to time. Maybe we can get a lead. But John, look, this is not a game. I wish you would reconsider all of this. - I can't go back now, Carl. One look at myself, this is all I see now. - Okay. All right, if any of these guys make you, we play it cool, okay. Just let me handle this. ¶ Sit down ¶ ¶ Sound the alarm, yeah ¶ ¶ I'll find you a new rescue ¶ - Two beers man. ¶ Let me run your game in lights ¶ ¶ It's not yourself, just you stay alive ¶ - There a problem? ¶ Your daily lives ¶ ¶ Do it yourself just to figure out ¶ ¶ Sell me a lie ¶ - That's how it is, huh? - Yeah, that's how it is, boy. - Man, I am hungry. Say you got anymore of that, what do you call it, nigger stew? - I'm sorry, Cage, not today. - Aw, that's a shame. 'Cause that nigger stew, that really hit the spot right about now, don't you think? All the luck, some big city coon, come in here today. - It's time for you to go, boy. - Nah. I ain't got my beer yet. - You see somethin' you like faggot? - What's that old joke? Cracker brings a knife to a gun fight. - What the fuck did you just say? - Easy there, Adolph. John. My friend Cage here and I got some catchin' up to do. So this is your chance to get the fuck out of here, right now. All of you. - You done fucked up, boy. - Go on big man, get. First off, you recognize him? - Fuck you. You pigs, you ain't shit, you hear me. - Again. Do you know this man? - No. - What about this? Aryan Marauders out of Idaho? That their tag? - Yeah. - You roll with them? - Fuck no, snitch ass motherfuckers. My crew's gonna come down here and drag your black ass down a hole you ain't ever fuckin' seen. You son of a bitch, you fucker. - What about this one? What's it mean. - Some bitch I used to ride with. - Ah, a woman. She must have been pretty special you got her tag on ya. - What's her name? Name? - Emmaline, Emmaine Langston, Lambo. Who the fuck knows. Calls herself EVL. - She get around, did she? - Ah, bitch rode with a few clubs. Whore. - Where is she now? - She got popped a while back, she's doing a stint. What the fuck does it matter to you, huh? Man fuck you both, you're fuckin' dead, you hear me? - Emmaline Victoria Lambert. Record shows possession, dealing, conspiracy. Accessory to murder. And known associates? Aryan Marauders. - Where is she now? - Doing a 30 year stint in Yuma in a protected unit. Where are you going? - To Yuma. - Alone? - Yeah, I think so. - You going for the truth? Or to end this thing? - Both. Investigation. 4218. - Miss Lambert? Uh, my name's John Hutton and I need to ask you some questions about a man I think you knew a long time ago. - Are you a cop? - No. Those are your initials, right? Your first name's Emmaline? There is a man who had this tattoo, he was a part of a gang, called the Aryan Marauders. - You came here to talk about Marcus? - Who? - Why do you want to talk about Marcus? - Marcus who? - Marcus Riddell. - What can you tell me about him? - Marcus was high on glass most of the time. Loved that shit. Almost as much as he liked to beat the shit out of me. - Uh, what happened to him? - One night Marcus comes to me and he says, "Let's go for a drive." Says he's gonna show me something special. Only this time he's dead sober. But he's still got that look he gets. That numb look. Like some idea got frozen stuck in that head of his. So he has me drive to this house. And he says we're gonna change the world. Change it how, I say? He says, something's gonna come down when he says so. He says, you'll see. You'll see all of it. So we go into that house. With them black folks. Marcus went after that man first. The daddy. He went fuckin' crazy on him with a knife. But he ain't done. Then the momma. And she starts screamin'. I've never seen so much blood. So much. And he lookin' at me now. And he says, "I just started what the world's gonna finish." I was so scared. And he sees me shakin'. And he says, "Baby, you just been witness. "Witness to a holy war, to race war." - Where is he now? - Are you his brother or somethin'? - No. - Cause you, you got them same eyes. Only yours got light in 'em. - Where is he now, Emmaline. - Dead. I ratted him out and then they executed that motherfucker. That's why I'm in this fucking cage! That's it? That's what you wanted to know? Hey! Hey! Who are you really? Hey! What the fuck is wrong, motherfucker! Fuckin'! - Marcus James Riddell. Convicted of multiple homicides against an African American family in '04. He was sentenced to death, remanded to the super max state penitentiary in Arizona where he served out the rest of his sentence. No appeal, no stay of execution, he got the needle in 2010. - Eight years ago. - All his state records, they checked out. Marcus Riddell is dead. You're a match. It's gotta be you. - I'm not this man, Carl. I cannot have done what he. My God, he. - Okay. Maybe not in your head anymore. But all of this. It's scary, John. - Where have you been going? - Huh? - I said, where have you been going? - Just, nowhere. Work. - I mean, you're somewhere else right now. Grace called. I asked him how the conference went. Why'd you lie to me, John. - After what happened with Lucas, I just, I needed some time to myself. - Okay. Maybe we should go someplace. Just the two of us. You haven't touched me in over two weeks. I don't even know if you want to. - Please don't say that now. - Well tell me what you want me to do? What can I do? - Nothing. I'm just tired. - You have to tell me what's wrong. - Nothing's wrong. Okay, nothing's ever wrong, Rachel, you happy now? - What are you talking about? - You think you know who I am. I don't even know who I am! We just decided eight years ago that I'm John Hutton. What if I'm not. - What if you're not what? The man I love? My husband? - Did, just forget I said that, okay, just, sorry. I'm gonna go pick up Jordan at your mothers. - No, no, no, forget it. I don't think I want her to be around this negativity. - Professor? The reading list? You said you were gonna make some changes? - Yeah, um. Sorry, uh. You know what? Let's just pick this up on Monday, okay? - It's a nice day out. I said, it's a nice day. - It's gorgeous. - Well, you got me over here. - What's he up to, Carl? You're his best friend. You're his only friend. But your my brother. Ever since that man showed up, he's been different Carl. Changed. Remember when we were little? I used to hide under the stairs when things got rough between Mom and Dad. And you would always come find me. Stay with me. Make me laugh. - I remember. - I'm not a kid anymore, Carl. - Why the special abilities? Languages, music, art, mathematics. - Maybe you guys are all some fucked up superheroes. - Heroes don't commit hate crimes. - Before we go back to asking why it happened, maybe we need to think about how it happened. So looking at Riddell, the others must be somewhere, right? Riddell is executed in Arizona. Within a year you show up in L.A., only a couple hundred miles away. - Okay. Michael Carnes, in Olympia, Washington, 100 miles away from the state pen in Walla Walla. Darin Lawrence in upstate New York, close to New Hampshire State Prison. Your boy Lucas said he woke up in Fort Meyers, right? Not far from say, Mississippi. - Okay, so, how are they all connected? - Riddell had no next of kin. I went through the records of all these prisons. Eight years ago you only had six prisoners put to death with no immediate family and no appeals. No one to claim the bodies. - Right. These three inmates, all from the prisons mentioned. Same physical matchup as our other guys, no next of kin, no appeals, all violent offenders. - They were all monsters. - Yeah. - Okay. So, why these prisons? - Well you can't just take somebody off of death row and disappear their ass. To many bureaucrats and red tape. But these prisons are probably contracted. That's big business. All, and I mean every single warden at those prisons, retired a year after these executions. Some very young. And they all have this in common. - Janus Holdings and Trust? - All four of those retired wardens sit on the board of this company. Founded the same year they retired. - What do they do? - Security consulting firm. But they got no clients, no website, no physical address. That's a shell company, man. - They got bought off. - Yeah, set up for life I guess. And check this out. One of our guys retired in our backyard, up in Ojai. Recognize him? George Hayes, Marcus Riddell's warden in Arizona. British immigrant, inmates called him King George 'cause he ruled the place with an iron fist. - I think it's time we got an audience with the king. - Wow. Impressive. All right, like before. You let me lead. You're not lookin' so hot, buddy. Maybe you should wait in the car. - I'm fine. Mr. Hayes. - Yes. - I'm Investigator Carl Chandler, this is my associate. Want to ask you a few questions about your tenure as warden at Black Rock Arizona State Prison. - What is this? - We just need-- - Marcus Riddell. Executed January, 2010. - Look, I don't know what-- - Janus Holdings and Trust Incorporated. Established July, 2011. - Nobody knows about this. Yet. Maybe we should talk inside. - I'm telling you, I never got a name. - How did it come about then? - After a convention in Tahoe I was approached by some suit. He invited me to a private meeting, then laid out the proposal. - The suit, government? - No. It was more of a Wall Street guy. He said that they needed a violent offender on death row, someone that could be taken off the books quietly, no appeals. - So you gave them Riddell? - Yeah, Riddell. - Then what? - Well, they brought in a couple of their own techs to carry out the execution and they said that when they were done the prisoner would appear dead. Well, everything went to form. And they took the body. - Where? - I didn't ask, they didn't say. - So you just let a murderer vanish? - That piece of shit was getting his lights put out anyway. Whatever they had planned for him was more than he deserved. - You still in touch with these people? You guys just don't get it. You think that I'm just free and clear here, huh? Well you know what, you boys showing up just make my life very complicated. - What do you mean? - Use your imagination. They're always watching us. Always. - What if we got you on record as talking to the cops? - These people you're asking about. They made it very clear to me how all this would all go down should I ever have that urge. And you know what? I believe 'em. I don't know what you think you're gonna do with all this. It won't matter. They've got more money, more power. I'm surprised you made it this far. - Come on. Let's get out of here. - Hey, who the hell you supposed to be, anyway? - I was Marcus Riddell. After Lucas shot himself, I went back to the motel for the notebook. And two men showed up, searched the place. - What? I think they're all part of it. - Jesus Christ, John. You heard what Hayes said. These people, whoever they are, they're dangerous. - Hayes belongs in the same prison he used to run. That's why we need to go to the police. - Now you want to go to the police? And you huh? How does this end? With you in some fuckin' jail cell, not having a chance to see your daughter grow up because you're so fuckin' concerned with justice. - You think I wanted this? I can't look my own family in the face, Carl! - I think we're done going down this path. You got your answers as fucked up as they are, you got 'em. We're done, I'm done. - I'm not done. I'm not done, I don't have any answers! I need, I need more, I need more time, I need - Hey, hey, hey, John. - Uh huh. - Oh shit. Man no, just. Kill it. No. Kill it now. - No. I can't, please. Kill it. - No! Dr. Morris, dial 118 please. Dr. Morris, please dial 118. - Hi. - Who are you John? - I'm not that man. - How do I know? How do you. Because that man never knew what love was. I do. They didn't make me the man I am now. But you did. You did. Oh, there's something else. The other men. They're all dead. - What do you mean? - The others, the men who got remade. They all killed themselves. And they all had symptoms. Fainting, the headaches. - The nosebleeds. - But the doctor said that, the doctor said you're fine. You're just a little dehydrated. Exhaustion. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no, now wait, wait, wait, that man Lucas. He wasn't well. - Whatever they did to us, it flips a switch in our brain and we just, I mean, that's why I had to find out. I had to try and stop it, but, I can't. - Then we will go to the police. Carl can help us. - I don't think that's an option. - What is this? Why can't the police help us, Carl? - And tell them what, exactly? - We tell them the truth. - The truth. Everything we have is circumstantial. They'll just think John's crazy. Hell it is crazy. But at the end of this mess we don't even know who the fuck is behind it or what they'll do to keep it quiet. - You need to take Jordan and go to your mothers. Just for a few days. - What? - I'm not gonna let the last memories of her father be this. - So we're supposed to leave? - Yeah. - So you can step in front of a bus? - Don't Rachel, don't. - No this is, this is absolutely insane. Hey, hey, hey. - How dare you, both of you! You said that my love made you the man that you are. The man that I love, the man that I love would never stop fighting. Ever. - I'll make sure they're safe. - I heard you were checking yourself out today. - You heard right. - May I? - Yeah. - I was told of your condition regarding your memory. I am truly sorry I wasn't more sensitive. With that being said, I still couldn't stop thinking about your reconstructive surgery. - How can I help you, Doctor? - I brought this, for you. - What's this? - There, that is a serial number of your chin implant. I took the liberty of tracing it back to its origin. It came from a company in Brazil. I contacted them to see where it may have been shipped. Which would help you perhaps find out who performed the procedure. - And? - Nobody in that office spoke any English. And my Portuguese is a little rusty. But yours isn't. Here's the number. - Thank you. Clear, clear, clear. - Fuck! Oh John. - It's a corporation. - What? - It's a goddamn publicly traded company. It's been in front of me the whole time. Here. Every dream I have ever had. - Okay, so what do you want to do about it? I want to finish this. I don't follow. - I am not Lucas and I am not Marcus Riddell and no one is erasing me. - Hey John, just slow down for a minute, okay. Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa. We both knows how this ends. Either at the end of a rope or with a bottle of pills. - Or a bullet to your head. - No. Fuck John, please, don't do this. - No matter what, I am bringing this to their front door. But I need your help. Hey. Hey. Hey! That's right. I've come home. - Drop the gun. - Kick it over. - Arms up. He's clean. - Let him in. - My glasses. - I think it would be more comfortable for you if you'd take a seat over here. Perhaps on the couch. Never enough time in the day, is there. But then I don't suppose I need to explain the value of time to you. How you found us, in and of itself, is a topic worthy of discussion, but I suppose the mystery can wait. Besides you must have many questions for me. - Why? Why would you do this to me? - Our company, it provides many services across many sectors, many markets, but all with one mandate. To advance humankind. It's a passion really. You see, society has proven itself to be largely indifferent to the concept of true criminal rehabilitation. Many have lost faith that anything can or should be done with those who have committed the most heinous of crimes. Many want justice at the end of a needle, the others a life spent in a cage. What does that say about us a culture, as a civilization? Have we forsaken the notion of redemption? But what if we could undo the corruption that has infected the worst criminal minds? What if we could start clean, purify? You reprogrammed us. - Not one of you reverted to a life of crime or violence. It has been an outstanding success. You are a success. You not only survived, you thrived. - The languages. The mathematics, the abilities, was that to help us? - They were the most unexpected of side effects, we're still looking into them but they have astounding potential. I would not say though that they didn't help you, would you? - Then why can't I live anymore? - I'm truly sorry, John, but we were only able to account for a handful of years in which the subjects had optimal mental health. After which we observed an inevitable and swift decline into dementia, then insanity. Truly horrible. So we put in a fail safe to ensure that you would be spared that. - Suicide. - We assured that the patient would self-terminate and because we needed only a brief period of time to prove the procedure viable, it was an acceptable loss. But I assure you, the next round we will improve the longevity of the subject by vast sums. But before you ask, no, I'm afraid that it is irreversible. - How could you just do this? I have a wife, I have a child, I have a family now. Who the fuck do you think you are? - John, do you forget that you murdered a family? A family just like yours with all the same hopes and dreams. - So this is supposed to be some sort of ironic justice. And my victims? Where's their justice now? - John, forgive me, but you are being shortsighted. Reprogramming is the future, a future with no more violence, no more killing, no more suffering and grieving and death and you have been the crucible for this change. You are now the very thing that Marcus Riddell was not, a true human being, with a conscience, with morality, empathy. Let's not lose sight of why you're even here, John. It is only because of us, that you have any life whatsoever is because of us. That you even know love for yourself or that beautiful family is our doing. - What do you want from me? - Thanks to us, yours is a resurrection story, you have been redeemed. - Gratitude. You're no god, you're no savior. The only difference between you and me? Is at least now I know I was a monster. You know, your goons outside were wrong. I'm not clean. - You see this new wireless mic, long-range, no detection. - None of us are. That you have any life whatsoever is because of us, that you even know love for yourself or that beautiful family is our doing. - Oh my God. - This should help corroborate all of it. I just need to know if this is something you can run. - Are you kidding me? I'll be honest with you. There's gonna be a lot of blow back on this. I need to get John Hutton on the record. When can I talk to him? After the story broke in The Times earlier this week, Federal indictments were handed down today, sweeping through the executive ranks of the Vettaplex Corporation, a major international biotech company with offices right here in Los Angeles. A whistleblower known as John Hutton was able to reveal a large scale operation that involved rebooting death row inmates in several state prisons throughout the country in what some are calling a gruesome form of reverse eugenics. Arrests were made at the Vettaplex Corporation this week, at the highest level of executive authority, while the outrage of the public is mounting to a fever pitch. And conspiracists and online chatter is now saying that the programming will be-- The president will be addressing the public later today on the scandal, hoping to answer the many questions surrounding the event. While many are waiting for a response from The White House, there is now a call to launch a congressional hearing on the matter immediately. At the heart of this harrowing story is a man who has lived two lives, a man who started over out of the darkness. A man who had to face that darkness once more. A man who, in the end, put right and wrong above himself. - Where is he?
