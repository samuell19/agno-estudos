(gentle music) - [Woman] For decades, NASA repeatedly stated that there is no proof of life in the universe and no evidence that unidentified flying objects are from other planets. But, in July of 2015, the world’s most advanced space agency made an unprecedented announcement. A prediction that we will find other life and that it will be found within our own galaxy. Most astonishingly of all, they placed a time frame on what undoubtedly be the most significant event in human history. NASA claimed that not only will we find evidence of extraterrestrial life, they stated that this discovery will happen in the next 20 years. - [Man] The American Broadcasting Company and affiliated stations present Headline Edition with Taylor Grant. Today's Edition presents a round up of the latest developments in the finding of a flying disc. Landed at a ranch at Corona, New Mexico. Rancher W.W. Brazel was the man who discovered the saucer. Colonel William Blanchard -- - [Simon] I’ve never understood why we laugh at those people who say they’ve seen UFOs. We know from declassified documents that whatever they are, some of them are real, and can’t be explained. - Back to the original Don Schmitt, what are they hiding? - Well I think they’re hiding first of all the fact that -- - [Simon] There’s one UFO case that never goes away, and some investigators who will never give up on the truth. - It's one of the reasons that we encourage the witnesses to come forward, because after all -- - [Simon] I’d made contact with Donald Schmitt. He was still digging for evidence at the most famous crash site in UFO history. - [Donald] The fact that they’d threatened these people, that they went into their homes. - [Simon] I'd spent years trying to get access to those last living witnesses, and eventually, I found my way in. - [Donald] Actually threatened physical violence if they should ever talk about this, this highly -- - [Simon] After a lifetime of wondering, I was going to Roswell. (dramatic music) - [Reporter] This is a Fox News alert. Overnight, the government shutdown for the first time, partially, in 17 years -- - The fiscal deadlock between the White House and GOP officials continues, with the partial government shutdown. - [Simon] The timing for the new dig couldn’t have been worse. The US was in shutdown. (phone dialing) - [Simon] Hi Don, I’ve just landed in Albuquerque, are we good to go? - [Donald] Yes, hi Simon. I don’t necessarily have the best of news, I’m sorry but because of the government shutdown here, as things would be caught up in Washington, and specifically to the Department of the Interior, we may have to postpone. - [Simon] But the bad news didn’t end there. My first interview, and the reason I’d flown to Albuquerque, had to cancel at the very last second. Eleazar Benavides, a retired military man, is the only person alive who says he saw the dead occupants of the Roswell UFO crash. Despite all the setbacks, I had other witnesses to see, and Roswell was still 200 miles away. The Roswell incident is the most documented case in UFO history, and the people connected to it still living get fewer every year. If you want to get to those witnesses, Donald Schmitt is the man you need to speak to. He’s also one of the few investigators left still working on the case. - You didn’t read about that in the press, because again the press won’t touch it, this is considered taboo, this is fringe. - [Simon] For more than 20 years, Schmitt has been looking to prove that Roswell was in fact an extraterrestrial event. - [Tom] The bodies came in. That was her story. - [Simon] Don Schmitt and his writing partner Tom Carey still work the case more that 60 years after the event happened. - So you guys are still finding witnesses, like daughters and sons of witnesses -- - Daughters and sons and we found two, two first hand witnesses in April. These were in the year book? - Yes. You had a room set up? - [Simon] But there was someone else at the meeting I wasn’t expecting. Jaime Maussan is a Mexican journalist who’s been reporting on UFOs for years. (announcer speaking foreign language) A long time supporter of Schmitt and Carey’s work, Maussan is another prominent figure in the UFO scene. (announcer speaking foreign language) - So I think we have plenty of seating space. - [Simon] So the dig was back on, and Schmitt was busy prepping the troops. - Appropriate clothing, appropriate footwear -- - [Simon] But this mixed team of investigators, photographers and loyal followers were already set for the early start the next morning. (intense music) - [Tom] Light 'em up! - [Simon] Searching for fragments of a real flying saucer felt a long way from reality. But Don meant business and he kept the precise location coordinates a closely guarded secret. - [Radio Announcer] KBIM, 94.9, a country giant. Zia Guns is your American family gun shop, they’ve been doing it for 28 years, it is a family run organization. 1907, dark days in Roswell. 28 years -- - [Man] We have another one. - [Man] Somebody’s got my gloves. I wonder who that is. - [Woman] It's me, do you need them? - [Man] Somebody didn’t plan ahead did they? - [Simon] How confident are you of the position? The actual.. - This being the site? - [Simon] The two positions you’ve just pointed out now. - It's where we left off last time. It's about 30 yards, for about three hours. So we’re going to work down to that flag, and then as I describe each grid, we’re going to, and then move out. And so because we’ve already mapped out the site we’ve laid out the grid in the past. And now it's the focus on this one area that's been the most promising. - Can you take a look at this one here? - [Simon] While the team got to grips with technicalities, I thought I’d see what Jaime Maussan had to say about the dig. But he was more interested in telling me about new evidence on Roswell. Some old pictures that showed strange looking bodies. - Do you know about the photographs that they’ve found? There are two photographs, two slides, where you can see the bodies. But there is something in the photographs that they don’t trust is, they are codified, and they don’t know what is says. And they are afraid this could be a hoax or a trick or a catch or something just to, to... Expose them as, as fools. And I said, “why don’t you release them now?” And they said, "We have to be very careful because "we don’t want to be exposed." - [Simon] I'd been tipped off about slides of a dead alien back in the UK, and as dubious as it sounded, there was obviously more to it. But I’d got someone to see back in Roswell. His father had been on the base in ’47 at the time of the crash. He’d never spoken on camera before. (mysterious music) - With the US government, is known to cover up things, I mean factual. - [Simon] Yeah, of course. - I was involved in one which was the, the pursuit of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in 1974 and '75, because I was in Viet Nam and, they didn’t admit that until, what, 15 or 20 years ago. - [Simon] Gary’s father had been on the airbase the very day that the Roswell incident happened. - My father was stationed here on the 509th and, had top secret clearance, and was a flight engineer on the B-29s at that point in time. If in fact it had been a benign military test or a weather balloon, they would have talked about it. - What do you think he witnessed, yourself? - He knew the pilot’s names, he had flown with them, he had been to Patterson Air Force base many times. It was a cover up, I mean it's evident, I mean... These guys came to town and drank, you know, when they were off a lot, hard partiers, warriors, and I just can’t fathom that all of a sudden everything was just turned off like a faucet, that there was no talk, there was no gossip, there was no scuttlebutt, I, I don’t buy that. I was in the service myself, I know how that works. - [Simon] Yeah. - We all tend to agree that the older people that were here at the time that were subdued, or coerced or threatened, that they were shut down for a reason. Okay here it is, this is building 84, this is it. - [Simon] Gary had more to say, but he had to wait. I had someone else lined up who’d also never spoken on camera before, the once son in law of Dan Dwyer, the fireman who saw the UFO wreckage. - I heard this story from Dan Dwyer in 1959. I was going into the army, and I was out in the front yard with him, and he said, "I want to tell you something Ken, "that people don’t talk about, but it... "Involves the alien incident. "Our fire crew from the Roswell fire department "was one of the first on scene." He said, "When we got there, we’ve seen things "like you’ve never seen before. "There were two", I’m going to call them creatures the way he described it. "They were dead. "And there was pieces scattered all over the pasture. "Within two days government people showed up "talking to the families of... "The people who had been on site, "and were told to keep their mouths shut, "not to discuss it with each other or anyone, "or basically the families would be split up "and they’d never see each other again." That was the threats, it scared the heck out of the kids. So, no one ever talked about it. - [Simon] Ken seemed sincere, but his story was a long way from the official version of events. - [Woman] On July 3rd 1947, something exploded mid air near to Roswell New Mexico, and came down leaving wreckage sprawled over a square mile. The US Air Force say what crashed was a military device, being flown for Project Mogul, a top secret program monitoring the nuclear activities of the Soviet Union. They also claimed what witnesses saw were just crash test dummies, dropped from a great height, and that little grey men never entered the equation. Case closed? Afraid not. This fourth official explanation was given 50 years after the event. In 1994 the Army Air Force had put out its third explanation admitting it had lied after all, with its weather balloon story back in '47, which was actually its second explanation. Confused? That was the idea. In 1947, three hours after its first press release, the US Army Air Force, as it was then called, claimed that this first statement, the one admitting they had retrieved a real flying saucer, was also incorrect, and that it was nothing more than a simple weather balloon. All in all, four official explanations over a 50 year period and officially three sets of lies, admitted to by the military themselves, all on record. - [Simon] It was the last day of the dig. And it seemed like the pressure was to find something. (all talking softly) - Turn by turn coordinates on getting out there decided to go and turn, well it was, I turned on my computer -- - Yeah, yeah. - [Simon] The convoy was in a hurry, and took a different route in. And as I held back for the Mexican crew to keep up, the rest vanished in the dust clouds. Within minutes, we were lost. Is this it? Is this it? The only man with coordinates had left us behind, and there were roads to nowhere in every direction. Yeah. It's all pretty difficult. Which way was it now? To the left? - Left. - Was it left? We were miles from civilization, and we’d been lost for nearly an hour. That was them. - [Donald] Just stay with us now. - [Jaime] Yes, please. - [Simon] Guys, what happened? - You lost us. - No, we were behind, you lost us! - We were doing about 40 all the while, we were making sure, and the others all kept up, but we’re okay now, stay with us. - I promise you I won’t forget after this. - [Donald] Okay. - [Simon] Glad to be back on track, as Don drove away at his version of 40 miles an hour, there was a day I wouldn’t forget on this trip, the day I met with Frankie Rowe. Her father was Dan Dwyer, the witness who had shared his story with Ken. She’d held some of the fragments of the UFO, in her own hands. - Well it was a few days after I was at the fire station, that the military came to our house. I saw the car when it drove up the driveway, and it was a military car, you know flags and all, they went all out for this. He started asking questions first about what did I think I saw? And I told him the whole thing, I saw the material, I saw the state cop that came down and he said, "No you didn’t, you didn’t see that." I said, "Yes I did." So I came back at him which made him angry. And he’s very emphatic about it, beating his hand with his night stick, and telling me, I didn’t see all this, I didn’t hear it and I didn’t know about it, and if I ever talked about it, or told anyone about it the rest of my life, they would come after me. He said, "This is a big desert out here, "nothing but a desert." He said, "We can take you out there and bury your bodies "and nobody will ever find you." Due to a phone outage on my house phone, a telephone repairman discovered that I had a... Wire on my phone that was transmitting everything that came in or went out, to some other location. It could not have been there when I bought the house because I had my service put in, repairmen were out there. Someone installed it for whatever purpose, I don’t know. - [Woman] Just after the crash, Mac Brazel found wreckage on his sheep ranch. He took some fragments to the town sheriff at Roswell, who immediately called the intel officer at the Roswell Army base, Jesse Marcel. This is where things got much more serious. After retracting their initial statement and publicly playing the event down, the army then turned the entire region upside down, and threatened the witnesses with their lives, if they as much as whispered about what had really happened. They even arrested Mac himself, for simply reporting it to the authorities. Locking him up, until he was persuaded to say that all he had seen was a weather balloon. But hundreds of witnesses are now on record saying this mundane explanation is a complete fabrication. Dozens of credible professionals with everything to lose and nothing to gain, say the official story is a lie, and that it was in fact an object and persons of unknown origin. - [Simon] My next connection to the case was Fawn Fritz. She was the granddaughter of Mac Brazel, the rancher who’d found the UFO wreckage. - It happened! Sorry, it happened! It was here. They had trucks and trucks of guys out here, dad said. They were out here for days and days and days. And they just didn’t come once, they came back twice after that too. (metal detector warbling) Grandpa picked up what he found, you know the pieces. And then they went back over to Floyd’s, and he wanted to show them to Floyd to get Floyd’s opinion of what he thought they were. And they sat there and had coffee. Well how could he do that? Well he didn’t realize, he had no conception, that there was a spacecraft laying down here in the ditch somewhere! I mean when the military come out here, they were out here for days and days and days. And I mean they were walking shoulder to shoulder. And if they even thought that it was anything to do with the crash, they picked it up. So I mean as far as there being any pieces left no, no. I... It's a waste of time and money to even look. - [Man In Hat] That’s a big chunky, actually that's a nice artifact, 'cause that's a big chunky piece. - No, it's not a bullet. You can see it's... - [Simon] So during the last hours of the dig, they’d found something; A piece of metal which had been buried under the earth, strangely with no visible corrosion. There’s so much strong evidence on the Roswell case, but this was a long way from it. - The truth is constantly, just like the crash site, the debris field, the truth has its way of always coming to the surface. And I for one am always going to be watching for it. There are only two possibilities for what happened at Roswell in 1947: it's either the greatest hoax of all time involving hundreds and hundreds of people, from all walks of life; civilian, military, media, the press, or... It's the greatest story of the millennium. And, when that final announcement is made, when that final proof is presented to the world, I want to be there. - [Simon] But when it came to talking about the slides, Don was still being guarded. I thought I might have more luck with his research partner, Tom Carey. Just tell me if you will, there’s, you’re working on something new, you can’t tell me very much about it, can you explain a little about what that is and why you can’t discuss it? - Well I will tell you a little bit about, perhaps our most important project that we’re working on now is a, a third party has come into possession of some... Items. And they date from 1947. Now Don Schmitt and I want to get our own analysis, we’re not going to sign on to something that blows up in our face, in this business that’s terminal. So I can tell you that right now, these items as I have viewed them, are compelling to me. And if they pan out, and go all the way through the due diligence process and come out at the end of the line authentic, then in my mind we have a significant proof for the Roswell event as an extraterrestrial event. - [Simon] So according to Tom, they could well be sat on the story of the millennium. But it was time to leave, and I'd still not met anyone who had been part of the cover up. I had one chance left, and he lived somewhere in Alabama. He’s the only surviving member of the air crew who flew the wreckage to a secret government location. I hoped if anyone could tell me what happened on that July day in ’47 that it might be this guy, Arthur Osepchook. - [Flight Announcer] Welcome to Mobile Regional Airport. Your safety is important to us. Please stay with your baggage and personal items at all times. - [Simon] Arthur, already in his 90s, lives not far from a place called Mobile, strangely enough where Steven Spielberg filmed the final scene to his 70s UFO classic: Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It felt weirdly appropriate. I’d worked years for a day like this, and I couldn’t wait to hear what he had to say. How you doing? - [Arthur] Pretty good. - [Simon] I spoke with Arthur while he was at home with his family. - I was a side gunner, and then they had the right gunner. We shared a turret and we had a tail gunner. - [Simon] Ozzy and his crew had had the highest top secret clearance in the military. The 509th Wing Command Group were responsible for carrying the atomic bomb. - Whatever they wanted to move from the base was top secret. But what shocked me when he got that plane over the pit, it was covered, and then they covered the bomb bay doors and they told us to get off the air plane. It was surprising, I had a top secret clearance. - [Simon] So that was unusual, was it? - It was very unusual. We were shocked, it hurt our pride a little bit! - [Simon] It seemed incredible, that a crew with high top secret clearance weren’t allowed to see what had been loaded onto their own aircraft. - Then when we got back to Roswell, that's when they told us to keep our mouths shut. I remember, "You don’t tell anybody, "you don’t tell your wives, you don’t talk to anybody, "you don’t talk to each other about it." No one knew about this mission, when we weren't to Fort Worth, it was all secret. See, none of the base crew members knew about it, we never talked about it. They really scared us when we come back. This was the most top secret thing I ever seen when I was in the Air Force. - You take good care. - Hang in there now. - I will. What had they flown to Fort Worth Texas? We might never know. Don eventually agreed to set up a meeting with the owner of the slides, but he still wouldn’t give up the contact details of the last witness. - [Donald] I will contact Eleazar and then I will also talk to the owners of the slides. - [Simon] I just hoped it wouldn’t take too long. I was still waiting for the interview Don had promised me with the owner of the slides. And then a strange thing happened. - Welcome back. President Bill Clinton is here with us, so -- If I was president, and I won’t be, let’s be honest. (audience laughs) The first thing I would do after putting my hand on that bible and taking that oath, to serve the country, is, I would, I wouldn’t even probably finish the oath. I would run to the White House, I’d demand to see all the classified files on the UFOs. (audience laughs) ‘Cause I’d wanna know, I’d wanna know what has been going on. Did you do that? - Sort of. - Sort of? (audience laughs) - Yeah we had... I think it was at the beginning of my second term, we had an anniversary of Roswell. I knew we’d get, you know, zillions of letters, so I had all the Roswell papers reviewed. Everything. - If you saw that there were aliens there would you tell us? - Yeah. - [Jimmy] You would? (audience cheering and applauding) - [Simon] A US President had admitted on national television he’d asked to see the Roswell documents. The connection between UFOs and US politics wasn’t going away. (plane engine roars) Stephen Bassett is a political activist, and the only lobbyist in the US on what he describes at the ET issue. - The problem in this field is not scientific, it hasn’t been, this issue has been proven 50 years ago. This is a political problem, it's a political policy. You can’t solve it with science, you have to solve it with political engagement. And so, okay, I know Washington, I’ve been there, I’ve lived there a lot of times, I’m going down there, I’m going to engage the ET issue. Politically. - [Simon] In 2013, Bassett organized the Citizen Hearing on Disclosure, a serious attempt at engaging Capitol Hill, on what he claims is an ongoing truth embargo, concerning an extraterrestrial reality. Like many, Bassett argues there’s an ET reality being covered up, and that UFOs are just the side show. The difference is that he’s turned this belief into a full time job. Every advocacy movement that has been of success and importance, had a defined prize. The women’s right to vote movement, that was a no brainer. We want their right to vote, we want the amendment. They pushed, they got it. All right? Civil Rights movement was primarily about getting the Civil Right’s Act. What was the prize in the extraterrestrial phenomena movement? We gave it a prize. And that word turned up, started to emerge the very late 1990s, didn’t really get under way until about 2000, called ‘disclosure’. The formal acknowledgement of this extraterrestrial presence, by world governments, starting most likely with the single government. That is disclosure. That is the prize. That is what we’re seeking. (applauding) - [Simon] I wasn’t sure if this was inspired, brave, or completely insane. Maybe it was all three. Richard Dolan is a respected author and UFO researcher, who began as a political historian. I wanted his take on US politics and UFOs. - It wasn’t really until the United States Freedom of Information Act became significant in the late 1970s, that some researchers were able to, as it were, shake that tree and documents started falling out. When you have objects described in formerly classified government memos as being disc shaped, as invading sensitive airspace, as being able to outperform our best interceptors, and when you can see from the tone of the memos that this is a very serious matter and how could it not be? Then clearly there’s something important happening. You would wonder, "Well great, so where’s the larger "public discussion about this? "This is really interesting information." And I’ve been asking myself that question ever since I’ve been in this field. My conclusion is that there’s been a tremendous amount of control and manipulation over what we call mainstream media, over our political institutions, our academic institutions, and I think that’s really what’s happened. - My hand would just, it'd still be hot from touching the bible, and I would immediately race to wherever they hold, have the files about Area 51 and the UFOs, and I’d go through everything to find out what happened. Did you do that? - That’s why you will not be President. (audience cheering applauding) Because that’s the first thing that you would do. (both laughing) - It's at the top of my -- The aliens won’t let it happen. (audience laughs) You’ll reveal all their secrets. They exercise strict control over us. - When a President, or a former President, appears on a TV show like that, nothing is left open to chance, not a single thing. So clearly Obama’s people and Clinton’s people made an arrangement and said, “We’re going to talk about these few things here”, so what we really want to be asking is why, why would Barack Obama and why would Bill Clinton want to talk about UFOs with Jimmy Kimmel? - [Simon] It was a good question. Stephen Bassett had some ideas on the answer. It went back to ties between the Clintons and one of America’s richest families, the Rockefellers. - Laurance Rockefeller approached the Clinton Administration of March 29th of 1993. He’s a billionaire friend of the Clintons, big donor to the democratic party. He approached the administration with the intent of convincing President Clinton to release all of the UFO files. And thus began the Rockefeller Initiative which lasted for three years. Meetings were held amongst researchers, many of which are still alive, at Rockefeller’s ranch in Wyoming. Then the Clintons went out in ’95 and met with the Rockefellers at that ranch, where this was discussed. By October of 1996 it had run its course, the files were not released, disclosure did not happen, Clinton was running for re-election, and that was that. 16 months after President Clinton was out of office, his former key advisor, and Chief of Staff, John Podesta, came to the National Press Club, and introduced a new organization called the Coalition for the Freedom of Information. And in the introduction he makes a very profound statement which is now on the internet. - I think its time to open the books on questions which have remained in the dark on the question of, of, government investigations of, of UFOs. It's time to find out what the truth really is that’s out there. We ought to do it really because its right, we ought to do it because the American people quite frankly can handle the truth, and we ought to do it because its the law. - Who does Barack Obama pick to be his Chairman of his transition team to create the new government? John Podesta, who called for the release of UFO files twice and was involved in the Rockefeller Initiative. And they get together and who do they pick to be the Secretary of State? Hilary Clinton. So with all of that background, now someone can understand why, with the Rockefeller initiative imminent, possibly as major news and them having to answer a whole lot of questions, Podesta puts out that tweet. - [Simon] So there it was, an undeniable connection to UFOs, all the way to the White House, and beyond. It had been months since Don had returned any of my calls. I thought the evidence of the slides might have fizzled out. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. - [Woman] Now has this been released, to the public? - [Man] No, not yet. And the government knows you have this? You’re not scared of ‘em? - [Man] Here’s what I know, so far. Several months ago I was given a box of 400 color Kodachrome slides that appear to have been taken over a ten year period staring in the mid 1940s. Now I’m a sports guy, I cover sports for living. I’m not making any claims as to what exactly is in these two slides. - [Simon] So there was someone else making a film about the slides, and I’d been cut out of the loop, despite all the assurances from Don. And it was Jaime Maussan who would host the event from Mexico City. After being kept waiting for more than a year, it felt like I’d been hung out to dry. Whatever the reason, I wanted to know why. I had to go to Mexico. (intense music) (phone ringing) - Hola. - Jaime. How are you doing? Nice to see you again. Been a long time. It felt like a reunion. Tom. But Don was still nowhere to be seen. I remember you from that windy day... Then this guy walked through the door. I didn't know who he was at first. It was Adam Dew. But then it all clicked. It turned out that Dew was also the person behind the film Kodachrome. So as well as being the owner of the slides, he was making his own film, and was here in Mexico to promote both. It was all starting to make sense, and I could see why I had been cut out of the loop; It was all about money. (Jaime speaking foreign language) Maussan had somehow persuaded Richard Dolan into being involved. - Are you happy to be part of this? - I’m, I’m sorry? - Are you happy to be part of this event? - Oh yes, yes, yes, but I didn’t accept immediately, I had to think about it. - You did. - There’s the risk that you might be wrong. That’s what life is, and, so we can, we can ignore the risk and just hide under a rock for the rest of our lives and not investigate, or we can put ourselves out there and give it a shot. - [Simon] As Adam Dew wouldn’t speak to me on camera, and still with no sign of Schmitt, they’d left Jaime to face the music. I don’t suppose you ever expected you would be doing anything like this? - No, I never expected to be doing this. Everything started when I met you in the digging in 2013, then I proposed this possibility, and they liked the idea, to do it in a credible venue, and it was very slow, it took more than a year to put everything together. - [Simon] In less than 24 hours, he would be presenting pictures to the world which he claimed would prove that aliens are here on earth. So a big name, Edgar Mitchell, had pulled out, but I’d heard that Don Schmitt was on stage. I thought I’d wait for the right moment, before I spoke. - We do mention many names, so you’ll just repeat them as you hear them. - Okay. - So they'll be pronounced correctly -- - [Simon] Despite waiting 18 months and travelling thousands of miles, my patience had to hold out a bit longer. Outside, up to 10,000 people were waiting to see pictures of what they thought could be an alien body. (crowd cheering and applauding) (Jaime speaking foreign language) - [Simon] It feels to me like you’re already preparing for battle before the day. - No, its because I’ve been in battle before the day. I’ve been in battle for three months. Probably if I was wrong in something, if I thought this was real, and it wasn’t, and somebody proved that, then I would accept that I’d probably made a mistake. But now, I feel so confident. - All the documents from Roswell had been destroyed, surrounding the incident, and if we believe that as Congressman Schiff didn’t, we realise that we were really getting close to something extremely sensitive, extremely classified. - People like Don Schmitt and Tom Carey, they have dedicated their life to do the Roswell investigation more than anybody else. How can they think that they are so dumb that they are going to present a mummy, or a child, or something? - Do you think its possible that they are doing it, because, they think the subject is so serious that something like this might damage the subject? - Honestly, some of them think especially after the Santilli autopsy, after 20 years, somebody’s coming back with the same, you know, lie. Then they think that they should have stopped us, some of them, before we damaged this phenomenon for them. - [Simon] There’s going to be a very obvious criticism, that's going to come from one direction. And the direction is, you’re making a lot of money out of this event, or you might be. (laughs) - No, I’m risking so much money. I don’t know if I’m going to get it back, I don’t care. Just the auditorium costs you more than $100,000, $130,000 for one day, and the tickets, and the rights that I had to pay, and the stage, and the production, and the cameras, and everything else. It's a lot of money, my friend. (crowd applauding) - And while we all waited for Adam Dew to show the world his alien pictures, I noticed he never actually said they were pictures of an alien. - The first thing that we decided to so was to try to read this mysterious placard that appears in the case that holds the body in the photos. If we could read this placard, mystery solved. - [Man] Yeah, this one’s actually more visible. - [Man] Roswell huh? - [Man] Not sure whether you’re going to be able to get anything out of that. We’ll see. - Sadly, Walker was correct, we couldn’t really make anything clearly out of the placard, there’s a list of several others who made an effort but didn’t have much luck. - [Simon] So, a mysterious placard that couldn’t be read. - Kodak also recommended that we show the slides to a certain Kodachrome historian, in Rochester. - [Simon] Photographic specialists, that didn’t want to be named. Was this all he had? Apparently not. - If you think you might have pictures of an alien body, you want to show them to someone who claims that they've seen alien bodies. He was a Private First Class at Roswell Air Force Base in July of 1947. - [Simon] It was Eleazar Benavides, the Roswell witness I’d been waiting to speak with, since 2013. - A copy, I just say if this is a copy, they did pretty good. (Jamie speaking foreign language) - [Simon] It was definitely a strange looking body. But proof of aliens? According to the science, yes. And there was lots of it. (speaking foreign language) - I’m a former retired academic, who at times worked in fields like human evolution, primatology, comparative anatomy. On closer examination, its not a human being at all. It is not even a mammal. Jaime had one trick left; a 20 foot high 3D holographic animation modeled from the slides. (mysterious music) (crowd applauding) The whole thing had lasted over four hours, and had felt totally surreal, but there was one person I still wanted to see. - I can assure you as of tonight, all the attacks are going to come from the United States. Certain people who said, "Well just release it, just come out with it", and if that would have been the case, if we would have just released the files to our peers, there would have been two camps: Those who want to believe that they're genuine, and those who, again... Whose agenda is strictly to destroy, but we took our time. There was analysis, there was investigation. Biggest problem we ran into in the States was we couldn’t get anybody to look at these. I’m mean, its true we can’t prove... - I think we can. - [Donald] But by eliminating what it isn’t, - I mean, my friend, don't be so negative. - That's all that's left. No, no, that’s all that’s left, that’s all that’s left. - Don’t be so negative. - We go home this week, and we're going to have, you know, our friends call for our heads, on a block. I mean, we’re not stating, you know, it's alien, but the point is, what else could it be? - [Simon] So in a room full of people, I finally got to ask why he’d stopped all the contact. - I've written eight chapters of the next book for the last four months. I just had two performances of Elijah, of the professional choral group that I sing with. We’re redesigning the museum in Roswell, because I’m an advisor to the board, I’m totally involved in all we're redoing -- - [Simon] And that, seemingly, was that. Was there anything you think you could have done differently, or you feel -- - What else? Bring the body. (laughs) What else can you do? Tell me? If they say its a mummy, where is the picture, where is the mummy? If they say anything, they have to prove it my friend. I think it was very solid, very well supported. That is all I can say. - [Simon] I couldn’t argue with him. Whatever people felt about it, Jaime Maussan had just put on the biggest show in UFO history. I'd gone as far as I could go in Mexico, and with Roswell. Being amongst the UFO scene is like living inside a bubble, and bubbles always burst. - [Radio Announcer] A group called the Roswell Slides Research Group, had used a de-blurring process to look at the placard that was visible in the slides and within hours they were able to decode it, to de-blur it, and were able to read it well enough to realize that what we had was -- - [Simon] Schmitt had told me that the long wait had been so they could perform due diligence analyzing the slides, but members of the public had made more progress in one day than their scientists had made in three years. And the online UFO community were out for blood. - [Chris] It was just a matter of hours before some of the very clever people in the Roswell Slides Research Group who had access to some sophisticated software, and when I say sophisticated I mean software that’s available for most personal home computers, they were able to de-blur the writing on the slides almost immediately. - We managed to acquire a copy of a high quality image of the placard. And that’s when things started rolling, one of our members named Nab Lator, I remember him showing a picture and it sort of said, "something of two". At that point I said, "Really? "These are words, we’re actually seeing words "on this placard when other people had said "they couldn’t find anything. Within a couple of hours, we had come up with "Mummified body of two year old boy." - [Simon] Whatever secrets the US Government has on UFOs, events like these surely serve to keep the ridicule factor as high as it can go. - Tom Carey and Don Schmitt, who I was working with at the time, mentioned nothing to me about this. They never said a word about it. I don’t know why I was cut out, other than they may have thought I’d have been overly skeptical about the slides showing an alien creature. - [Simon] Not long after, even more paperwork and a second picture surfaced which seemed to bury the case for the slides once and for all. Adam Dew had gone to ground, presumably richer, and Schmitt had started to make a U-turn. Once again, they’d left Maussan to face the music alone. - It's not the same size, it's not the same length. One is 29 inches, the other is 47 inches. It's a big difference, I’m sorry. I want you to look at the new picture, and the old picture and tell me where is the hands, where is the hands? There are so many people saying that I did it for the money, without any proof, any proof. They don’t know how much I won, they don’t know how much I lost, they don't know anything, but they talk and talk. I can tell you Simon, that I lost money in this event. Period. And I can prove it to anyone who has a good reason to know. I am tired of the personal attacks. I’m not a criminal. I am really an honest, and I have integrity -- - [Simon] I never did meet a cosmic whistleblower with definitive proof on UFOs. When it comes to Roswell, maybe all we can do after all is listen to those people who were closest to it. - My personal belief is that there was a craft that crashed out there that was not from this world. - Look how many years its been since it all took place. I mean, there's a lot changed in this world in that time. We’ve learned that space travel is possible, and we are doing it now, why couldn’t it been done from another universe many years before? - [Simon] I'm still no nearer to finding the truth about UFOs, but we all deserve to know it. Whatever that truth is. - [Richard] I do think its important for all of the people, and this includes myself, who were involved in the Mexico City event, simply to admit the slides show a child mummy. That means Jaime, that means Don, that means Tom Carey, that means Adam Dew. - UFOlogy has been damaged by the Roswell slides case, but the slides are a symptom, you know? It was bad research and I think there’s a lot of it. - The placard says that it is a mummy, then one has to accept that. That was the point of my apology. - I am hurt by Don Schmitt, because of what he did. No question about that. He said he was threatened, that they wanted sue him. - There was some legal situation regarding the use of the name of the particular individual, who served to analyse the slides, and that’s all I’ll say. - I think we need transparency and we need to talk about what’s going on in UFOlogy to elevate it, to the level of what you would be doing in a real science. - Would you think that anybody who says, "I have an extraterrestrial body" is going to get away with it? Do you think that it's going to be accepted? Would you do it? - If our failing is anything, it's that we relied too much on the scientific communities, and science as we know is far from absolute.
