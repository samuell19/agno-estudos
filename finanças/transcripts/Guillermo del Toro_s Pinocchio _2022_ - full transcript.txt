By the time Master Geppetto made Pinocchio, he had already lost a son. Now this was quite a few years before my time, but I learnt the story. And then it became my story. Geppetto lost Carlo during the Great War. They'd been together only ten years. But it was as if Carlo had taken the old man's life with him. Whoa. Whoa! - Papa! Papa! - Yes? - Guess what I saw? - What? - Guess! - I've no idea. - I saw some planes! - Oh, did you? Good. - What is it you're making this time, Papa? - Guess! - A soldier? A magician? A witch? - No. No! No, no, no, no, no, you have to wait and see, Carlo! All good things require patience. Huh. They wanted for nothing. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. All they needed was each other's company. And the old witch warned the little hedgehog, "Do not tell lies, or your nose will grow and grow up to here!" His nose would grow? Lies, my dear boy, are found out immediately because they are like long noses, visible to all but the teller of the lie. And the more you lie, the more it grows! Sing me Mama's song so I can sleep.

I love my new shoes, Papa! I am very glad, Carlo. - We're going to church first, right? - Oh, yes. Yes. Hello there, little dog! Buongiorno, Geppetto. - Morning! - Morning. Master Geppetto, you gonna finish the crucifix today? We're gonna do our best. - Ladies. - Aw, such a perfectionist. A model Italian citizen. And such a good father. Carlo, nice shoes. Catch! Thank you, sir! - Good morning. - Hi! - Buongiorno. - Buongiorno, Dottore! Ah, Carlo. Geppetto. Yes... - It looks great, Papa. - Oh. Is it almost time to go home? Almost! Send up a little more red for me, Carlo. Oh! I forgot to show you what I found. What is it, my boy? You'll see. Ta-da! The perfect pine cone. It still has all its scales! I thought I could plant it myself and watch the tree grow. And then carve toys for myself. Like you do. I think that's as good an idea as any boy ever had, Carlo. Isn't it? What's that sound, Papa? Is it a plane? Gather the tools. Quickly. We'll go home to a warm fire and hot soup. - Could we have some hot chocolate too? - Sure. Sure. It seems like a hot chocolate sort of day, doesn't it? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Fine. Papa! What is it? Nothing. I'm sure it's nothing but... Oh, wait. My pine cone! It was later said Geppetto's little town was not even a target. That these planes were heading back to base and simply let go of their bombs to make their ballasts lighter. Carlo! Ah! Huh? Huh? No... Carlo. Geppetto never left his side. And that was that. He worked very little. He ate even less. And the church's crucifix remained unfinished. The years passed. The world moved on... but Geppetto did not. And this is where I come in. You see, I was a writer. And for years, I'd been looking for the ideal conditions to set my illustrious, fascinating life story to paper. Until, at long last, I found it. My sanctuary. Home. Ah. Here I could write my memoirs. And what a tale it would be. I had lived in a barrister's fireplace in Sardinia, sailed on the Adriatic in a fishing boat, nested one Perugian winter with an acclaimed sculptor. Stridulations of My Youth by Sebastian J. Cricket. I dreamed of you, Carlo. I dreamed you were right back here with me. My son. Oh dear. If only I could have you back. I am so sorry. I watched the old man weep. And it moved me. And it turns out that I wasn't the only one watching him. In my many wanderings on this earth, I've learned that there are old spirits living in the mountains, in the forests, who rarely involve themselves in the human world. But on occasion, they do. I want you back, Carlo. Right here! With me! Why won't you listen to my prayers? Why? Where were we? Ah yes. Perug... Whoa! What in my antennae? I will have him back. I'll make Carlo again... Wha... Hey! ...out of this accursed pine! Whoa! Ah! What on earth?! No! Ah! Ooh! Yah! It's a house of horrors! Ah! Ah! Ah! Huh? I... I will finish you tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Hey! Get away from there. Go away! Bugger off. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is my home! No trespassing. Go! Go! Go! Go! Get away from here. Go away! Go away! Yes, that's right. Little wooden boy, may you rise with the sun and walk the earth. Excuse me. Can I help you? This is my home we're talking about. May I ask, who on earth are you? On earth? A guardian. I care for the little things... ...the forgotten things, the lost ones. Well, I am Sebastian J. Cricket, homeowner. And I have every right to be consulted about your schemes and machinations regarding my property. Well, since you already live in the heart of the wooden boy, perhaps you can help me. Help you what? To watch over him. Guide him to be good. I'm not a governess, madam. I'm a novelist, a raconteur, currently immersed in writing my memoirs. Well, in this world, you get what you give. Take on this responsibility, and I will grant you one wish. And that could be anything? Anything at all? The publication of my book? Fame? Fortune? Anything. Oh. Maybe I can help. I'll try my best, and that's the best anyone can do. That's rather clever, isn't it? Little wooden boy made of pine, we shall call you Pinocchio. May you rise with the sun and wander the earth... Ah! ...and bring joy and company to that poor heartbroken man. Be his son. Fill his days with light so he'll never be alone. Ah. Huh. Who goes there? I'm... I'm warning you! I... I have a weapon! Wha... Good morning, Papa! What is this? What kind of sorcery? You wanted me to live. You asked for me to live. Who... Who are you? My name is Pinocchio! I'm your son! You are not my son!

It's a puppet to... to entertain! If he's a puppet, where are his strings? That's true. Who controls you, wooden boy? Of course, I control him... Who controls you? No one talks to the Podesta like that. He... He's a puppet. Just a puppet! No, I'm not. I'm made of flesh and bone and meaty bits! I'm a real boy! - A monster! - Demon! It's an abomination. - This is the work of the devil! - Enough! This is a house of God. You drunken fool! You carving this... this thing while our blessed Christ hangs unfinished all these years? Take that unholy thing away. Take it away! Now! Yes. Yes, Padre. - Shame on you, Geppetto! - Burn him! - So sorry. - Chop him up! - Oh Dio mio. - Sorry, sorry. He'll be fine. - Curse you, Geppetto! - The Lord will punish him! Get out! ♪ Yo dee lo dee Lo dee lo dee lo dee lee ♪ - Stop fidgeting, please. - Hello! Carlo never acted like this. Papa, why did my nose grow today? You lied, Pinocchio, and a lie is plain to see as your nose and... And the more you lie, the more it grows. - Is that it? - That... Yes, that's it. - There you go. - Chocolate. Thank you, Geppetto. We appreciate your hospitality. Candlewick, go sit by the fire. We are here to talk about the incident at the church today. The community was startled by your creation. As Podesta, I must ensure that this puppet of yours poses no threat to our community. Oh, no, no, nothing like that. Oh! Is that hot chocolate? You're a puppet! You've never eaten anything in your life! Oh! Oh, that must be why I'm so hungry! Oh, I'm starving, Papa. I'm starving to death! You are not! Now go sit by the fire and let me talk to our guests. But I don't want to! I want hot chocolate! - Please, Papa. Please! Please! Please! - There, there now. Here you go. Oh boy! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes. Yes, Pinocchio. Go... Go warm your feet by the fire. Obey your papa. Oh yes, I will obey if I get chocolate. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! He really is a charming boy. Podesta watches over the town's moral well-being, you understand? His authority cannot be questioned... That's right! And I won't be mocked! I will do just as you wish. You have my word. - So, what about this wooden boy? - Ah. Will you let him run wild through town all day? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'll keep him locked up! Right here in the house. I won't be locked up. I'll smash the windows out, I will. This abnormal boy lacks discipline. But he seems strong, sturdy, made of good Italian pine. Oh, very good pine, yes. Not perfect, you see, but, uh, he means well. Hey. Try to get closer to the fire to get warm. Son, come here. Look at my boy, Candlewick. Yes. Yes. A model fascist youth. Proud and brave. Virile, like his father. And his teeth, perfect teeth. And no sign of jaundice. Papa? Papa! My feet feel hot, like chocolate. Look! Ah! What?! Fire! My house is on fire! Yes! Look at me! Look! I'm on fire! Yay! Aw. Look what you did, Papa. You've ruined the nice light on my feet. This is what you get with an undisciplined mind. You must send this child to school. To school? Pinocchio? Yes. Tomorrow. School. Oh, what a day. What a day. Oh, what a day. What a day. Time for bed. You know, Papa, I like my old legs. And I like them on fire. Pinocchio, if you go to sleep, I'll make you a new pair of legs in the morning. Just like the old ones? Better than the old ones. Better? Can I have cricket legs, Papa? Can you make me four of them? No, no, no, no. No, just two. Two will do. Good night, Papa. Good night, my... Good night, Pinocchio. Sebastian? Yes, Pinocchio? Who's Carlo? Carlo was a boy. Geppetto lost him many years ago. Where did he put him? How can you lose a whole person? I mean, he... he died, Pinocchio. He's no longer alive. Is that a bad thing? Yes. It's a great burden for a father to lose a child so young. What's a burden? It's something painful you must carry even though it hurts you very much. I wrote a lot that night. I had so much to say. Not about my own life, for a change, but about imperfect fathers and imperfect sons. And about loss and love. Hmm. And for that one evening, at least, we were, all of us, blissfully oblivious. You were right, Papa! These legs are much, much, much, much better than the old ones! Ha! Look at me! I can walk backwards. Hup! And... And jump forwards! Hup! - I couldn't do it before! - Huh? Ooh, Papa! Can you see this? He looks just like me. What is that? Pinocchio! Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! I love these new legs, Papa. - Can we go to the carnival? - Hmm. Perhaps, Pinocchio. Perhaps. Right now we have work to do. - Work? I love work! - Hmm. Papa, what is work? Oh, Pinocchio, please. No more questions. Huh. Stupid monkey! Whoa! I'm coming! What is it? What are you doing here? Ah! I told you to put up posters and draw big crowds. This carnival is going to pot! And you?! Can you not see how desperate the situation is? A what? A living puppet?

Him. - Huh? - They were all singing to him. He's made of wood too. Why do they like him and not me? Come here, Pinocchio. People are sometimes afraid of things they don't know, but they'll get to know you and like you, and for that, uh... Are you ready for school? Then I have something I'd like to give you. Ta-da! I love it, Papa! I love it! I love it! I love it! What is it? It is a schoolbook. A very special schoolbook. One which belonged to a very special boy. Carlo, the boy you lost? Uh-huh. Was he a very good boy, Papa? Yes, he was. And you loved him very much? I did. I... I do. Then I will be just like Carlo! I will obey and go to school, and I'll be the very, very best at... whatever they do there. I'll make you proud! ♪ Off to school, off to school ♪ ♪ Going to school, going to school Off to school I go ♪ Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! He exists! Oh, this dream, this wonder exists! You beautiful, brilliant baboon! I must have him. Whoa! ♪ Off to school, off to school Going to school, going to school ♪ Hup! School! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! - What do you learn in school, Mr. Cricket? - You'll learn reading and writing. You learn the multiplication tables! What's the mulplitication tables? Well, say you have four carts, each with, uh, 27 apples. I don't care what the table says. I have no apples, and I refuse to lie! Oh, no. It's just math! So you multiply the four and the seven... four past seven? And you get... I get confused. I don't think I like school anymore, Sebastian. Ah! We have found him! Look, Spazzatura! Our miracle! - Our sensation! - Hey, watch it! Our star! Who? Me? Yes, mon étoile! I am Count Volpe! You have been chosen! Come partake in the fun, fanciful, carefree carnival life as the star of my puppet show! Don't listen to him, Pinocchio! You promised your papa you would go to school! Oh, yeah. I promised my papa I'd go to school. See? He gave me Carlo's book. Carlo's book? Yes! Yes! A classical, canonical work. I can see you're intrinsically an intellectual! But then now, book learning cannot compare to witnessing the wide world with one's own eyes from atop the glorious stage. Wow. You shall see all of the nations of the earth for yourself as they bow at your feet. My brand-new feet! No! No, wait! You have to go to school! Oh, can we do it tomorrow? Regretfully, no. For today's the only day that our cacophonous carnival will visit your vicinity, but if you must go to school, then you must go to school. Come, Spazzatura. We must find someone else to eat all our ice cream and popcorn and hot chocolate. - Hot chocolate? - Oh no. Yes, of course! All the hot chocolate you can drink and all the games you can play. Oh boy, oh boy! Maybe it'll be okay if I'm a little bit late for school? Yeah, perfectly fine. No one will even notice. Don't listen to him, Pinocchio! Ah, we have one last detail to take care of. Whoa! Sign here, here, and here. Need a pen? No, Pinocchio! Don't! Like this? Perfect! I will now make you burn bright like a star! Follow me, my boy! Oh, the pain. Life is such hideous pain. Master Geppetto, would you mind coming down? Oh, at last! Our savior is restored. Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry. Your boy didn't show up at school today. But he left this morning. I... I sent him there. Obviously, the puppet is quite a dissident. An independent thinker, I'd say. - Uh, uh, uh, yes. - You better look for him. I trust we will see the wooden boy tomorrow at school. Tomorrow? Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Ah! Boy, the carnival sure is grand. How about some more popcorn? Oh, I couldn't eat another bite, Mr. Diavolo. I better get going to school, I guess. Stay a while, Pinocchio. I am sorry to keep you waiting, my little puppet. I don't like being called a puppet. My boy. Puppets are le meilleur qui soit! The tops! Lift your arm. Puppets are well respected in every station of life. But I thought it was best to be a normal boy. Oh, no, no, no. People love puppets. Like Il Diavolo, Columbina, Punchinello. Of course, there's but one puppet who is king of them all! Oh boy, I'd like to meet that guy. Pinocchio! Wait. That's me! That's right. You are a wonder! A miracle. They'll love you! Who? Les Idiots! The wonderful children of the world! Lift your leg. Everyone shall love you and call your name. Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Pinocchio, the living puppet! Oh.

Thank you. Oh, you're very kind. You ruined Carlo's book, and you didn't go to school! Why? You promised me you would behave like... like... like... Carlo. Yes. I was going to, Papa, but... but... Yes, Pinocchio. What? Ten bandits came out of the bushes and took... ...out of the bushes, and they took the book. Oh, I... I see. And then what happened? They had an axe, and they wanted chocolate. Hot chocolate! Pinocchio, you shouldn't lie to me. I am your papa! But I'm telling the truth! Then why is your nose growing? It's not! Lies, lies, and more lies! I am not lying! Will you look at you? Go away! This is not a spectacle! But it is! Unhand my carissimo, you carousing... kleptomaniac! Do not touch him! I made him! And I discovered him! - He's not your puppet. He's mine! - Oh! Perhaps we should... Oh, he is neither! He's an actor. My actor. Give him to me! Never! Oh dear. That was so much fun, Papa! No! No... Pinocchio. He came out of nowhere! That's what happens when you let your children run wild! Pinocchio was dead. That much was apparent to any astute observer. But little did I know that death was not the end. ♪ Thou art gone ♪ ♪ Thy life hast fled ♪ ♪ All shall now bewail thee dead ♪ - Did you hear that? - Who's there? - I thought he was dead. - He is dead.

I hate being dead. Uh-oh, now you did it. What's that? Processing. Go see the boss, kid. Through there. You'll see her. Give me a freakin' ace, please. Hello? Hello? Who are you? I feel as though you've been here before. I am Pinocchio. I'm a boy. And I think I'm... dead. Ah, yes. I see. The wooden boy with the borrowed soul. My sister's folly. The sentimental fool. She gave you life, Pinocchio, when you were not supposed to have it. No more than a chair or a table should. As a result, you cannot truly, truly die. Oh boy, oh boy! And... And that's good, right? Well, it means that you are not, nor will you ever be, a real boy like Carlo. The one thing that makes human life precious and meaningful, you see, is how brief it is. Oh. Don't get me wrong, you will die many, many times. This being one of them. But they are not real deaths. Just waiting periods. There are rules, you see. Despite my sister's disregard for them. We will both have to wait for the sand to run out. You will stay here with me a little longer each time you cross until the end of time. And then, after that sand runs out? I will simply send you back every time. I see. Well, in that case, I'd like to ask you one thing. See you next time. No. No. Ah, Pinocchio. Niente. There's not much we can do. I'm afraid the body is rigid. Well, he's always been rigid. He's made of wood. Even if he's dead, I could still book him. How dare you, sir! Show some respect. You show respect to me and my projected quarterly earnings! Gentlemen, please. This is no time for your petty grievances. How do you intend to dispose of the dead body? A dead body? Where? Pinocchio! You're alive! He is immortal! Long live the arts! It's a miracle. Take it easy, my child. Lean on me. We're going home. Uh, uh, uh. Wait a moment. I have a legally binding contract. Signed by both artist and management. He either performs, or you owe me ten million lire! Well, that's ridiculous. It's just a smiling sun. It's still his signature, is it not? I drew that. Ha ha! I demand full restitution before the law, including transportation, transmutation, all the future represe... Our country comes first. This boy cannot be killed. - He's the ideal soldier. - Hmm? He must be drafted into the youth camps by law. You will learn to fight, and fire a weapon, and be a real Italian boy. Now we... we must go. We truly must go. We will all speak later, I am sure. Not to me, sir. Speak to my lawyers! What... What a day. What a day! A fun day! What will we do? Oh, don't worry, Papa. I'll go to war. It sounds quite fun. I can learn to fight and fire a weapon and march like the... No, Pinocchio. War is not fun! War is not good. War... War took Carlo away from me. Then I simply won't go. But you have to go now. It's the law. Even when it's something bad? Yes, we all have to obey the law whether we like it or not. Why? I don't have time or patience enough to explain that to you. I... I... I owe that man a fortune. And you... you will be taken far away and recruited into military youth camp. And now... now look what you've turned me into. I made you to be like Carlo. Why can't you be more like Carlo? Because I'm not Carlo. I don't wanna be like Carlo. - Carlo is... - Enough! You are such a burden. Oh. His nose didn't grow. What's that? When he called me a burden, his nose didn't grow. That's how he really feels. I don't want to be a burden. I don't want to hurt Papa and make him want to yell at me like that. Oh, Pinocchio. Sometimes fathers feel despair like everybody else. And they say things, things they only think they mean in the moment. But with time, they learn that... well, that they never really meant it at all. Do you understand? Hey. Hey, where are you going? I've got a plan. - Pinocchio, wha... what are you doing? - You'll see! I'm going to the carnival. That way, I can help Papa, and I won't go to war. I'll leave him a note explaining everything. No, Pinocchio, don't do this. Oh, that's... No! No! Hmm. No! No, don't do this! You tell him that I will send him money. And tell him I love him. And I won't be a burden anymore. No! Huh? What is it? What do you want in the middle of the... My beloved star! How can I be of assistance? If I work for you, will you forget the money you want from my papa? Huh? Oh, absolutely, my dear boy. And will you send him my share of the profits? Clear accounting all the way. Fifty-fifty, right down the middle. Oh. Everybody up! We're leaving! Oh. The pain. Pinocchio. Son. I just wanted to say... Pinocchio! Oh! Little cricket. He's gone! To the carnival! Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Get! Get! Oh. How will I ever find him? Oh, now you want to find him? After all the things you said. After you called him a burden! A burden?! Why are you so blind? So absolutely blind! The boy loves you. He has much to learn, but he loves you for who you are. Would it kill you to do as much for him? You should start acting like a father. A real father! Not an old stubborn goat who's so busy moaning and crying about his losses... "Me, me, me, poor me!" ...that he cannot see the love he actually has! I may be a bug, sir, but I have a thing or two to teach you about... Hey! Where are you going? After my son! Excuse...

Fifty-fifty... minus expenses, transportation, and promotion. Huh? Tomorrow we go to a small town by the sea. Catania. And there we will perform for his excellency, Il Duce. Il Dolce? No, my brightest star. Our fearless leader, Il Duce, Benito Mussolini! He heard of our act and is coming to see us! Oh! He and I are very close. Here we are in Roma. That's him, back there. You will make me and your papa so proud. Proud. Excuse me, sir. Catania. Do you go there? Can... Can you take me there? Please? It's just across the strait. That's not the sea out there. It's a graveyard! Oh dear... Oh... The dogfish, risen from the icy depths to take its tribute in blood and steel. A monster the size o' 20 ships, full of hunger and rage. Oh please. That's just children's stories. Captain, my son is on the other side of the gulf. He is performing tomorrow. This is all I have in the world. Take it. It's yours. I just want to see him again. Step and turn. And step and turn. And look alive and step. - Step. Step. - Can I take a moment to rest? No. Your tempo is getting sloppier and sloppier. No rest whatsoever. Five minutes, please. Three minutes. Ooh. Are you feeling okay, Pinocchio? We're concerned. You look so tired and worn out. You need a good long rest. And some trousers and another ear wouldn't hurt either if you ask me. Why not go home and visit your papa for a while? This is no place for you. I can't. I have to keep working and working and sending money. Yeah... The truth is Count Volpe is using you. He hasn't sent a penny to your father. What? He keeps all the money for himself. He doesn't care about you. You're not his favorite. Spazzatura is his favorite. He's always been. He's a genius. No! Count Volpe wouldn't lie to me. I'm... I'm his star! You're... You're all just jealous! Ugh. You think we will find him, Sebastian? My Pinocchio? I do.

What have you been saying to him, huh? On the night before the big performance, you could cost me everything! You know who's coming? You have any idea? I found you at the bottom of that cage in the rain. You were left there to die. Nobody wanted you, and I saved you. Rescued you! I should've let you die! Hey! Stop that! Don't hurt him anymore! This does not concern you, Pinocchio. You're a star. Go rehearse your steps. I demand that you stop! You said it! I am the star of this show, and I won't have my costar treated this way. And what's this I hear about my papa not getting any money? I might just go home right now and ask him. What do you think about that? You can perform for Il Dolce yourself. I think you misunderstand our relationship, my little fire hazard. I am the puppeteer. - Uh! - You are the puppet. I am the master. You are the slave! And you will do as I command until your wooden body rots, and I use you to warm my furnace! Oh. You may have no strings, but I control you. You obey me. Capisce? Spazzatura. A son knows when his father is alive. He will look for us, you'll see. You have nothing to worry about. Easy for you to say. We are having dinner tonight. We're so lucky! Oh, Your Excellency! I wrote this number just for you. I like puppets. - Hey, Spazzatura. - Hmm? You know, I think we ought to make this big showstopper extra special for the all-important Dolce tonight. - Huh? - I got some real good ideas. I think that will definitely work. In bocca al lupo, my puppet. Delight the Duce, and I will shower you with glory. Oh, we'll give him a show he will never forget. ♪ I fight for the land ♪ ♪ I fight oversea ♪ ♪ For baby-poops-his-pants Right there in front of me ♪ - ♪ The poop in hand, for fatherland ♪ - Poop?

I was run over! I could get killed a lot! I'm the luckiest boy in the world. As I see it, you were charged with a terrible burden. Huh? A burden? No, I'm not. That's a horrible thing to say to a boy. Life can bring great suffering. And eternal life can bring eternal suffering. Aw, it's not so bad as all that. Yeah, I get a little beat up every time, but as soon as I get back, I'm going home to my papa. Ah, but, Pinocchio, what if you don't see your father again? Of course I will. Why wouldn't I? While you may have eternal life, your friends, your loved ones, they do not. Every moment shared with them may be the very last. You never know how long you have with someone until they're gone. Huh? I... I don't understand. Can... Can you tell me more? Please? No! No! No! Aha! I knew it! You came back to life. Hi, Candlewick. Most of us, we have but one life to give for our fatherland, but you... you have no limit! - Me? - Yes! You! Follow my orders, learn to obey, and you will be the perfect soldier. But, my papa... You'll return home a hero. Any father would be proud of such a son. We're here. Wow! What's all this? The Elite Military Project for Special Patriotic Youth. - What's an elite? - We are. We're gonna learn to be elite soldiers! Learn? Like school? To... To read and write and do the mulplitication thingies? You're funny. Listen up. They're reporting hostile planes in the area. But we will carry on with the exercises tomorrow. Anyone here afraid of the enemy? - Uh-huh! - No, sir! Mm-mm. Good. You may be boys, but you have the hearts of men. Tomorrow, you train for the glory of Italy! Tomorrow, you will make your fatherland proud. Pinocchio. Pinocchio. Yeah? What do you think my father meant about those planes? I don't know. I still don't really understand what we're even doing here. We're preparing to be soldiers. For war. But my papa said war is bad. That's 'cause he's a coward. A coward? My papa? Well, he's afraid of war, isn't he? My father says if you're afraid to die for your country, you're weak. You're a coward. Are you afraid? I'm not afraid at all. Well, neither am I. Or my papa. - I love war. - I love it more! I love it twenty-four seven, every day and anytime! - So do I! - Well, we'll see about that, won't we? I'll show him I'm no coward. I'll make him like me. You know, all fathers love their sons, but... sometimes fathers feel despair, like everyone else. And they say things they only think they mean in the moment. But with time, they learn they never really meant it at all. And they may even call you ugly things like a burden or a coward, but inside... they love you. Are you scared? Of dying? Me? Nah. I died a couple times. It was all right. There's rabbits and card games and a lot of sand. Blue sand. You're so weird. No weirder than you, pal! I'm... I'm glad you're here. Me too. And as with all great empires, the destiny of Italy will be forged in the strength of its youth. Today, you'll get your first taste of war. You'll form two teams. In the center of the battlefield is a tower. The first team to place their flag at the top of the tower wins. And remember, no matter who is on the other team, they are your enemy. May the best man win and bring glory to his team and honor to us all. Rifles are loaded with paint. And the grenades, confetti. Mark your kill, boys. For Italia! Hey! Watch it! W... Wait! Come on, boys! Let's go! - Go! Go! - Charge! - Watch out! - Oh! Faster! Follow me! Take this. You're both here. Why? We both won, Father! Oh. Is that so? And how did you come to that conclusion, may I ask? It was a tie. We both climbed up fast. Very good, then. Candlewick... ...shoot the puppet. But, Father... this is a real gun. Take your glory, son! Shoot the puppet! Take your positions on the parapets. Defend the center. For Italy! We are under attack! I told you to shoot the puppet! No! I will not let you do this! All my life, Father, just trying to please you. But I never will! You were right. I'm thin and weak and flimsy, just like the wick of a candle. Always afraid. But even then, with all the fear I feel, I can say no to you. I can do that. I'm not afraid to say no. Are you? You filthy coward! Yes, you are weak! You are no son of mine! Candlewick! Puppet! On your feet. Time for the final lesson. Now, you will know what it is to truly serve the fatherland! Ah! Ah! Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Hello, my little rebel. I've found you at last. I lost everything. And now you will too. Huh? Candlewick! Bonjour, mon étoile. No! Where's Candlewick? Spazzatura! Please! Help me! I'm all he has in this world, the poor thing. I have forgiven him. But you! You squandered everything! Give me that torch, Spazzatura! Spazzatura! Ah! Give me that, you mangy ape! Let me go! Is our contract worth nothing? I'll do my part, and you, you will burn. Burn bright! Like a star! Hey, that's hot! Worse than chocolate! Ow! Ow! Help! Please! Help! Help! Ow! Help! Ah! Whoa! How could you do this to me? And for a puppet? You loathsome lusus naturae! You will betray me no more! Spazzatura! Spazzatura. Will I ever see my papa again? Huh? Huh? Look! An island! Swim! Whoa! Huh? Huh? Ugh. ♪ And if you looked at me today ♪ ♪ My heart would heal so fast ♪ Papa? Papa! ♪ And if you held me right away ♪ ♪ I'd be complete at last ♪ ♪ At last ♪ Papa! You're alive! Pinocchio! Oh. My Pinocchio. Love hurts. You'll be okay, Papa. After you're feeling better, we'll go right home. Okay? No, Pinocchio, no. There's no escape from this dreaded beast. He comes seeking the warmth of the sun every decade or so. It will soon sink back to the depths of the darkest, coldest ocean where it dwells, and it will drag us with him. Oh my God! This is it! Follow me! Follow you? Where? Up to the lighthouse and freedom! The blow holes! We can climb out through them! But we... we'll never reach it. It's... It's too far! Pinocchio can help! Pinocchio, look. Listen. Listen. Okay, we have to climb... What is it, Pinocchio? Oh, Papa, I hate you! What? Well, what do you... And I hate you too, Spazzatura. And you, Sebastian J. Cricket! Yes, I see! Just this once, lie, m'boy! Yes, that's it! Lie! My name is Panucchio! More, Pinocchio! I love the smell of onions! I love... I love war! I wanna be trapped here forever and ever and ever! That's it! Climb now! Everybody, climb! Hurry! Come on! What are you... Oh. Oh. Now steady on... Whoa! Oh. Oh. Oh my word. Oh dear. Whoa. Hold it. Whoa. That's it! Don't look down, Pinocchio! Look at me! Look at your papa! Ah! He's going to sneeze! Hurry! Ah! No! No! Ah! I've got you, son. Hold on, my boy! - Ah! - Help! Help! Ah. Uh-oh. Whoa! Oh no! Pinocchio! Papa! Papa! It's coming for us! Quick! Come on, Spazzatura. You can do it! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Yes, faster, Spazzatura! Hold on! Ah! No, not now! Send me back now! Please! I need to go back to save my papa. You know the rules, Pinocchio. All the sand must fall before you can return. There's no time! He's dying! Rules are rules, and if we break them, there are dire consequences. If you were to go back now, so soon, you would become mortal. You might save Geppetto, but you will die, Pinocchio, and it will be your last life. I don't care! Send me back! Do it! Not me, wooden boy. Break the rules. Break them. If you're sure. Now, go to your father, child. And make the most of it. Ah! We made it! I can't believe it! Ah. Pinocchio. My boy. My boy. Wake up, Pinocchio. Like last time! Get up! You're fine. You... You... You are here. My dear son. Can't you see me? You're... You're alive. You're so free. I... I need you. Son. Master Geppetto. I only wished to bring you joy. And you did. You did bring me joy. Such terrible, terrible joy. Please, bring him back to me. To save you, he became a real boy. And real boys don't come back. I know that. I know! But... It's not fair! In this world, you get what you give, remember? And this boy gave... Well, he gave everything he could! You said if I should perform my duties and make Pinocchio a good boy, guide him into doing what is right, you would concede me one wish. I did. And did you accomplish this task? Okay! Fine. So maybe I didn't do so great. Maybe I messed up a little or... a lot, but, well, I tried my best, and that's the best anyone can do. Pinocchio taught me that. I mean, I taught it to him, and then he taught it straight back at me. And you know why? Because... Because he was good. Well, then, noble cricket, choose wisely. Well, gosh darn it! I wish him back to life! Very well, then. Little wooden boy made of pine, may you rise with the sun and wander the earth. Be his son. Fill his days with light... ...so he'll never be alone. Pinocchio. My child. I was trying to make you someone you were not. So don't be Carlo or anyone else. Be exactly who you are. I... I love you exactly as you are. Then I will be Pinocchio. And you will be my papa. Will that do? That will do. Aw. Oh. Life is such a wonderful gift. And so it was that we lived our lives. Checkmate! We never saw the wood sprite again. Geppetto aged. Pinocchio didn't. And in time, Geppetto left. One winter morning, Pinocchio found me by the window. I wasn't moving anymore. So he put me in a matchbox, and he carries me still with him. Right in his heart. He ventured into the world. And the world, I believe, embraced him back. I've not heard of him in quite a while. Will he eventually die? I think so. And maybe that makes him a real boy. What happens, happens. And then, we are gone. Are you gonna keep yappin', or are you gonna play? Do you mind? I was recounting my life! It was a good life!
