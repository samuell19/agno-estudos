LACTA PRESENTS THE TASTE OF LOVE Good morning, Aris! You look so handsome when you're sleeping. Are you feeling cold? Elli... Elli, what are you doing? Leave me alone, please! - I'm causing thermal interaction. - Don't. I'm not feeling cold. Elli, come on, stop. We've talked about this, haven't we? This thing you do every morning, it's kinda spooky, isn't it? Really? You haven't told me before! It's time to wake up. Never say again "it's time to wake up". Go to the living room and wait for me quietly. Elli? Elli! Elli? Elli? Hey. I'm calling your name, aren't you listening? I'm listening! But you said "wait for me quietly." What? Did I do something wrong? The way you put it, no! Oh God, I'm screwed... I'm late for a meeting, since 9 o 'clock! Don't worry! I've notified that an urgent video conference came up... with the Saudi investors, and rescheduled for 3 p.m. The next conference is at 8 pm... - Cancel it! - with your mother. - Don't cancel it. - I won't, thanks. Incoming mail: The profit rise stats, should have been sent... to the head of finances. - Send it right away! - Sent. Today, take the subway. An accident happened, and there's heavy traffic. - OK. - Also... a reminder about tomorrow's party arrived. You will... Cancel it! I'm not going. I've too much work. I'm leaving. Hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do. I didn't say that. Oscar Wilde did... - The Irish writer who... - I know who he is! I don't remember asking you to analyze me. If I needed psychological support, I wouldn't be living alone. I want you to live exactly as you want to! What's up? The "alarm clock" didn't work again? I can't seem to find the joke. Right. Technology is no joke. It made us live in this bright world. Is this going to happen every day, now? Do you want me to wrap it up and send it back to you? Our gift, the most advanced toy of the century? - Elli, isn't a toy! - Right! You can't call a toy a machine... that takes care of the home needs... provides full secretarial support... with access to your cloud data... predicts and satisfies your every need... Fulfills all your erotic fantasies. Elli! The girl of your future! Cut it out! If I wanted trouble, I'd have it. Go on now, leave! My friend. People buy robots to have fun. They're soulless. So are people. Let me ask you. You still haven't forgiven her? Nikos, I'm busy. Everyone deserves a second chance. Are you here to lecture me, now? "Are you bored with your Elli's monotony?" "Do you need a living, human personal assistant?" "Upgrade your Elli now, with the new Operating System 'E-motion'... with artificial emotions." "Give a soul to your android." What's up? You're eating with greed! Yes! Because I'm hungry, and it tastes really good as well. Well done! It's really good. So, is it taste that gives you pleasure, which makes you eat with greed? If it didn't taste good, but you were hungry, how would you eat? Elli, I don't want to upset you... but, I'm so bored with your robotic questions. I cannot be upset! Right! Computer! New messages. "There are no new messages." "The upgrade of the Operating System E-motion, with artificial emotions... is available right now. Do you want to install it now?" Yeah, right, OK. Lights! Upgrade is being installed. Do not deactivate your device. What the hell, I got burned! It hurts! It hurts? It hurts! Good morning, Aris! Time to wake up. Aris? It's time to wake up. Elli? How many times have I told you not to do this? Leave me alone. Go to the living room! OK, sleep as long as you want! Miss your appointments, miss everything! I've busted my head, damn it! Damn door! Damn it, damned door? I'm sorry! I'm sorry that I yelled at you. Actually, I wasn't yelling at you, I was yelling at the door. THE UPGRADE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED I see. Your upgrade has been successfully completed... Aris? I'm in a hurry. Reminder for today's product dinner... with the partners and sponsors, on the floating restaurant. If you want... - I could accompany... - Read my mails, my route... and get me my suit. Come on, quickly. It can't be. Someone's kidding me, right? Today, either I will go crazy... or I'll take you back to your makers, so they can have you at their home. I'm furious, right now! Right now, you're just ungrateful... and you don't appreciate those who care about you and love you. And what do you know about love? Artificial emotions, my ass... Search: "Love stories" "Romeo and Juliet" "Pride and Prejudice" "The Way We Were" "Wuthering Heights" "The Notebook" "Two For The Road" "The English Patient" "The End Of The Affair" What's going on? I want to ask you... how can people fall in love at first sight? They're delusional. How can they know, without data, that they've found their match? They're delusional. What's going on now? I was wondering... You don't have to. Aris? Why are you living all these years by yourself? Because I enjoy my peace, which right now, you're disturbing. Today, I discovered that the most amazing classic literature... has been written about love. Well done, so? And I wondered why you don't love anyone. Elli... listen to me. Read... watch movies... assimilate all the information you want with your super advanced brain... but, just leave me alone, ok? Have you ever read the "English Patient"? It was made into a movie as well. An amazing love story. Since you liked it that much... you should remember the quote... "there's nowhere to be safe, except within myself." Or something like that. "I love you" "I'm thinking of you..." "Are you going to be late?" "I've got too much work." "I'm calling you, where are you?" - "I'm still at a meeting." - "I can't take this any more." - "I've been looking for you all day!" - "Pick up the phone!" I can't believe what's happening! Retro music is so much fun! I think that the 20th century is my favourite. OK, carry on. Either way, this is going to be the last night. You might as well enjoy it. What do you mean? Nothing, it's just that... At dawn, you will be downgraded to the previous version. You won't feel a thing, and... We'll all calm down. I see. Then, there's not much time. I want to show you something. What does this chocolate mean to you? Well... what kind of question, is this? I have the right to ask you something just once... and get an honest answer. I want to know what this chocolate tastes like. I can't eat it, robots have no sense of taste. Last night, a couple was eating it in a movie... and it was like there wasn't anything around them. Like they didn't care about anything else... but that half-eaten chocolate they were sharing together. So, will you explain it to me? I want to know! You don't want to know what love really is. Trust me, it's the worst thing that can happen to someone. OK. You won't remember a thing by tomorrow, anyway. 20 years ago... 28 years old. 28 years old. We were celebrating the company's expansion to Dubai, with a party. "The future has come!" That's what the invitation read. December of '18. Near Christmas. I'll be outside your place in two minutes. Is that right? How? Will you beam yourself here? Why? Have I ever kept you waiting? - What are you wearing? - You'll see. Sorry baby, I have to hang up, I have a call from the company. Count slowly up to 120 and wait outside. Don't be late! Hello! Can Berlin hear me? It hears you, it sees you, it thinks about you and everything. Hi Iro, blue... haired? - Do you like it? - It's perfect. I can't wait to mess them up. You will mess them up, very soon. I'm in Greece, I'm coming to the party! What, aren't you happy? You know I'll be there with Ismini, right? Are you still with her? I'm just kidding, I don't care. Besides we always have our little moments, don't we? Babe... we can't be too affectionate at the party. Clients, partners, you understand, right? Yes. After the party, though... Frenzy! You understand how big this deal is for us... especially now, when the whole country is looking for opportunities. Yes. How stupid is this guy? Look here, what a mess... I'll show him! Wait! - That's Aris Oikonomou... - I don't care who he is! He might as well be Antetokounmpo! Hello. Thanks a lot. Actually... I don't waste my time with fools. You're fine. You're fine! I'm sorry. Go to hell! You need help? Thank you so much. Hello, in the flesh! Well, from up close, they're not that much blue. Iro, calm down a bit, baby. Can we meet afterwards? I'm sorry, I have to talk to a lot of people. Hello, Aris! - Thodoris! - What's up? You're acquainted with Mr. Akram from Kingdom Holdings, right? Thodoris, my boy, I introduced him to you, if I remember correctly. Yes! That's right! We said not to be too affectionate, but you've gone too far! Ismini! Baby... I haven't told you how beautiful you look today! To my girl! You know that we're just dating. We haven't said that there's something between us. Oh, come on now babe, don't spoil it! - Tonight is my night! - I feel dizzy! I think I'd better leave, I've got too much work tomorrow. - I'm leaving. - Already? Alone? At least, let me call you a taxi. Pavlina... Please... I can't leave just yet. - Yes? - Yes, good night. Better call a taxi for you, as well. - Don't drive like that. - But... You're not leaving the party, just before it gets wild, are you? I don't believe we've met. I have noticed you though, how about you? You're Thodoris' girl, right? Something like that. How "something like that"? Somehow. OK "something-like-that-Thodoris'-girl", don't you have a name? Pavlina. I'm Aris, and I don't want you to leave. Too bad, because I do. How can I find you again? My little boy, your girlfriend is waiting for you inside. Plus another two at the other corner. Find out what you want from your life, first... and then we can talk again. Good night. Good morning! What's up Thodoris? They're sending me to Dubai for three days. The contracts have been signed by the Saudis, so everything's perfect. Well done! Which days? I don't know. There's Papamichalis' wedding too. Oh, that's OK, he'll understand. I don't care about that, but... Pavlina is taking care of the planning. - Pavlina? - Yes. Who's that? May you flourish! May you flourish guys, all the best! If you drink too much... you will feel dizzy, and leave before the party gets wild. I don't think there's such a risk. Tell me that you came for me here, today. You really need to hear it, huh? With your permission, I'm working here. Yes, I really need to hear it. Do you know why? Go on. Because, I came here for you, today. And because, you and I will be together. And because, in the next two minutes, I'll take you out of here. Will I become an abduction victim? Regardless of the ransom, I'm not letting you go. So, should I try to escape? What will I have to give you, not to? Let me think about it. I got it. Whatever it is, you'll have it. I want the sky. You asked for it! Yes, it was a figure of speech though. I didn't tell you, but... I am little bit scared of heights. Actually, I am scared of heights quite a bit. Can we go down, can we think about it for a while? Come on, you don't really want to go down. Yes... I don't, but... I'm just a little bit scared. Don't be scared of anything. I'm here. For everything. That's a lie, but it's OK. It's the biggest truth I've ever said. No way! - It's really true! - Oh my, I'm so embarrassed now. - Seriously now, I stepped on you? - Yeap! After you had splattered water on me with your car. The wheel fell into a puddle. I was standing right next to it... How could you notice me... You have such a busy mind, what could you do? Actually, my mind was nowhere at all. Tell you what, give me that for a minute... I want to make a confession, and I need some alcohol. So... Oh, before I begin... What's up between you and that mouth-breather, Thodoris? Mouth-breather? How did you come up with this word... My grandmother used to say it, forget about the word and tell me. There's nothing special with me and Thodoris, well... there was something at some point... it could have been, but... you know how it goes. You? Me? Nothing. We're just colleagues... OK, we kissed once in the company restroom, but... Very funny. They're looking for you. Hey Ismini. Yeah, fine. Whatever you want, I'm listening. Well, wait, I have an answer. Exactly what I said, last time we talked. Why are you asking this? OK then... I will be honest. There is. Well... there isn't just yet... as I want her to be... in my life... but, she's inside my mind... all the time... all day long... from the moment... that he got out of the car... and stepped on me, clumsily. And then I saw her, among the crowd... and I knew it was her. And I got upset, somehow... because I knew I was going to get into trouble. But, the worst part is... I wanted to get into big trouble... with you. So, you won her over. Yes. I would do anything... I fell in love with her, in just one minute. Delusional, as I said... Oscar Wilde said, "One minute is enough to fall in love... but a lifetime isn't enough to forget." What did you remember then, when I showed you that chocolate? Nothing. Because, I didn't forget anything. I should have escaped, when you kidnapped me. You think you could? You think I couldn't? That hurt! What can you do? That's love. Don't disturb me now please, I'm enjoying it. OK, then. If you're going to look at me like a sad little puppy... Don't bother. All these belong to the past. They better be. Welcome! What's up? Nothing, I just... have to go to Dubai for a month again. Aren't you happy? It's a paradise there! - It's not that, it's just that... - What is it, Thodoris? Didn't you want to go there? Yes, I did, but with Pavlina, we're having some issues... I wanted to be with her, to try again and, anyway... I was thinking, if maybe, you could go to Dubai. No way man, no way. Let me tell you something, with women... it's all about the chemistry. You either have it, or you don't. You know that, right? I know everything, Aris. Everything. Look who added me today! For this woman, you can say "I'm getting married." Listen guys, life... needs action. If you stand still, that's it... You're done! You don't say! - Look who's talking! - I got committed, my friend... but, this doesn't mean I'm done. And put my slippers on. It's just that a player, needs some rest. He rests for just a short while... and again, towards glory he goes! For sure. It will be the wedding of the century. Alice, leave it to me, don't worry about anything. Everything will be perfect. You are getting married... my best friend, and I'm making the wedding plan. Your Pavlina... your most-in-love best friend. Damn it, Pavlina. You came here to talk about my wedding. - I think I feel... - Don't say it. - I think I love him. - You said it. I've picked up the wrong time to get married. Should we arrange for a wedding on the same day, perhaps? Ok now, that's a bit too far. Pavlina, how long do you know this little prince for? - Three months? - Four months, a week ago. Oh, she is counting the days. I'm losing my mind. Watch out, kid. Watch out, kid. Yes, mother! Why don't you like him? What's there to like? He's either working all week, or he disappears... receives strange messages at 2 am. How can you carry on with such a person? You've been together for 3 years. He's completely immature. He lives in his own world. Can't you see that? Who isn't like that? Aris has a 16-year-old inside him, I like that. What should I do? Put my slippers on and wait for the pension? There is so much you can do with someone... before you start the countdown to pension. You've known me since High School. Did I ever want to get married? There's the naughty boy. "Baby, I'll be late, cinema is a no go. Are you up for a drink at 12?" I don't even want to know what he's saying. I'll be pissed off. What can we do? It's what you get with signs of air. What can I tell you? Keep counting chocolates for 3 years, with the signs of air. OK, that was a bit harsh. My Pavlina, I'm sorry... Sorry, sorry... Do what you have to, I don't hold a grudge. You were always a bitch! You think I can't tell the hands that will caress me till I'm old? "Till I'm old"... What are you doing here, you half-married man? What does it look like, Iro? I'm waiting for my other half. - I used to be your other half, Aris! - You don't say! How did I miss that? You're not known for your emotional intelligence. You can't even keep a hair color! My poor thing, I am like air, just like you were once... and now you're talking about old age and other halves... Well, you have my best wishes. Iro, you're irritating me and I'm a weak character. Take a step back, because you never know what's gonna happen. What if I take a step forward? What's it going to be? I don't know, you'll have to take your risks. Baby, wait! Go to hell! - Where are you going? - Wherever I want, leave me. Just wait! Are we going to be gutted about her, now? Who's the most "whatever" person I know. She's what you deserve, Aris. Deal with it. - You won't go. - Don't come near me again! Are you listening to me? Don't you ever come near me again! "The subscriber you called is not available. Your call is being diverted." "Your call is being diverted." "Leave your message, after the beep." I left something at your doorstep... to tell you... that I already imagine my life with a person... and that person, has doubts about me all the time. But I have no doubts about how I feel. Good night. "Will you let me eat it all by myself?" Why are you doing this to me, damn it? Why are you so immature, damn it? I'm trying not to be, damn it... Try a little harder, damn it. I'm sorry. I like chocolate apologies... but, I'd rather have just the chocolate. I don't want us to fight again. We won't. Two weeks before Christmas, and you're telling me now? That you're having a reunion at Arachova with your friends? Don't yell in public! Calm down! I'll be with you on New Years Eve, it's just for Christmas. Well, if it's just for Christmas, then it's fine. Oh, come on Pavlina with your whining and your irony all the time! That's why I'm suffocating, this is exactly why! At least after seven years, you told us one reason you're suffocating. You see why you always need a man in the house? Yeah, keep joking now. What's the big deal, just two days with my friends, and back. Back where? Inside the cell? Oh come on, you interpret it that way. This and everything I say. Seven years together, and you still haven't figured me out. Seven years, and we don't even live together. Half of my clothes are at your place, your stuff is at mine... Seven years come and go! We don't live in different cities! We're ten minutes away. Aris, I don't see companionship that way, I'm sorry... It's very different in my mind. All right, can we take a couple of days to calm down... think what each of us wants, and talk again on New Years Eve? OK. "Calm down, think about what we want." Actually, I don't need any time to think. I don't want to be with you any more, we're done. Pavlina, be careful what you say! No, you don't get it. I mean it. I don't want to be with someone, who always wants to escape. Me? I don't want to push you, or call you a hundred times... and you answer whenever, or not at all. I don't want you to feel obliged to spend New Years Eve with me... and I don't want to feel that I'm forcing you. It's not an obligation, you just put everything in a box. I'm sorry if I make you feel that way. Aris, save it. I'm tired. With the apologies, with the chocolates and everything. You bring out a version of me, that I really don't like. That's a problem only you can solve. I just did. What's up man? I don't know. Existential crisis... And you chose to solve your existential problems here? Are you crazy? It's Christmas. Snap out of it! I will snap him out of it, I've got the manual from the old days. Aris... Come and kiss me under the mistletoe. Iro, cut it out, I'm bored. Guys, come on! We're starting the countdown! Everybody, take a glass! Pavlina? Why did you have to invite Thodoris for? Maybe because he's my friend? Maybe 'cause he's been waiting so long for you to get rid of... Forget it, I'm not cursing tonight. - Maybe this isn't enough? - Shut up! It is. I know what I'm saying. Hey guys, let's go, 5... 4, 3, 2, 1... Happy New Year! Pavlina? Pavlina? Why did you come? To wish you a Happy New Year! And, to ask you something. Ask. What do you want from me? Me? What do I want? Did I come to find you? Stop it. Stop it, you will break my nose. - Leave me! - Stop acting like crazy! Calm down! And now I'm going to tell you what I want. Or even better, what I don't want. - I don't care about what you want or not. - You care! Because, I only want to be with you. I went to Arachova, and I'm so glad that I went there... because my head shook with all these meaningless people there. Everything became clear. - I'm not having fun when we're apart. - You don't say. Try to listen to me, please. If you want me to, I will leave afterwards. You and me, we are a team. You are my love. My companion, my woman. You are. You have been from the very first moment. That was the reason I was afraid, and did all this shit I did. What were you afraid of, Aris? Love is not to be taken for granted, it requires effort... I know... That's why I came back, to tell you that I want to live with you... to take me back, and to forgive me. I want us to find a home... of our own. Tomorrow morning. And tell me yes, and marry me. I want to be saved from my stupid self... who's afraid to share his life, and only you can do this. Do you know why? I only want to be saved by you, because I love you. And, this is forever. That's all. Oh, and stop running after this mouth-breather... every time we argue, because I will break his head in two. Is this your answer? Can you at least give me, a more specific answer? Why do I have to bother with the wedding, right now? Maybe because, it's a month away? I don't know, I don't like Alice, I've told you a million times, but... if you really want to, make her your maid of honour! It's your call! Aris, I'm not getting married by myself. Baby, listen, right now my mind is on the trip... It's an important meeting, and you're talking to me about... maids of honour and wedding decorations. I'll go and get back soon, to get the stress off of me... along with Dubai... and we'll see. We're here, we're not going anywhere. It's the second time. Really? For me it's the 3rd. I like it a lot. It's sunny and hot, it's very nice. Yeah, it's nice... Excuse me. "I'm in a meeting. Call you later." What do we have here? Inspection? That's how it is, my friend. - No more hunting. Forget it. - Easy, big hunter! Guys, I'm not following. I have to sleep early. I'm flying really early in the morning, tomorrow... And you're not famous for waking up early! Something tells me that you won't be on time, Aris... I will be, though. They're waiting for me. I've set up 3 alarm clocks! Who is waiting for you? Someone who I don't want to lose. Well then, it's important. All for love! The guy is getting married, he is retiring. A last one for the road. Look who wants a french goodbye! "The subscriber you have called, is not available. Your call is being diverted." "Leave a message after the..." Pavlina! Pavlina? "The subscriber you have called is not available. Your call is being diverted." "The subscriber you have called, is not available..." Where were you? I've been looking for you, all day! Yesterday, I was looking for you, today you are looking for me... It was mutual. Just because I didn't call you? Are you paranoid? - What were you doing with this asshole? - Whatever I wanted to. We did it, is there a problem? I would spit on you now. But, you know what? I don't want to waste it. The end? Just like that? Just like that? We humans, have something we call a soul. And this soul can get hurt. Do you understand what I'm talking about? You hurt her, and she left. I understood. I hurt her? Because I didn't call her, she ran to that loser for consolation? I changed... my life's system for her, my needs, my priorities... everything. So, who was hurt? That's why I'm telling you, forget about it. Love and... nonsense. We humans aren't worthy of these things. You're lying to yourself. What do you mean, lying? Why didn't you call her that night? You didn't sleep in your hotel. You stayed in the bar until 3 am... and then, you went to another hotel. Don't worry. Your every move has been recorded in your cellphone... Why are you looking at me? Just like I'm seeing it now, that's how she could have seen it then, too. Technology has many aspects, unfortunately. And fortunately. I betrayed her. The only real thing I had in my life, I grabbed it... I just... crumpled it, and threw it away. My whole life, I was after something I didn't even know it existed... and when I found it, what did I do? I destroyed it. The idiot. If it was like that... you wouldn't have betrayed her. What can I say, maybe that's what human nature is, after all. A prey of our instincts. There are two kinds of tragedy in life... The first one is, when your wishes are not fulfilled. And the other one... when they are. Oscar Wilde? The Irish? The Irish. He knew about everything, that guy. I imagine that he just wasn't a coward. And he could stand looking... into the human soul. Are you calling me a coward? The device they gave me as a gift, calls me a coward! Why didn't you say you were sorry? Why didn't you run after her? They offered me the whole branch of the company here. I accepted it immediately. The only thing I could think of, was to disappear. Just like she did. I only had my work. The rest was colorless. Indifferent. Nothing. 48 years old... alone... without hope. Without anyone. With a robot, as a birthday present. At least, you got a nice present. Yes. A fantastic gift. You annoyed me at first. You were bothering me, I wanted to shut you down. But, in the end, I liked you. I was impressed by your cheerfulness, your care... the knowledge you were absorbing so quickly. And by how quickly you got to know me, who was hiding from everyone. At the end, Artificial Intelligence, is a great discovery! Artificial Intelligence, means to learn from what you try. From the wrong paths. What did you learn, with your human intelligence? I learned... that life is too short... to not have someone to share this chocolate with. Then, why don't you go and share it with her? Can't you forgive her? I have forgiven her. It's she, who will never forgive me. Then, who do you think has sent you this chocolate? Pavlina? You, huh? Did you talk to her? How? I just forwarded one of the 97 emails you've written all these years... to ask her forgiveness. And you never dared to click "Send". I did that for you. I'm sorry. I'm programmed to predict and fulfill all you desires. OK, after the last update, maybe I pushed it a bit too far. After tomorrow, you won't have to worry about me. The downgrade. I should have them stop it! There's no time! You're flying to Athens in an hour. The ticket is on your cellphone, already. Thank you. Elli... you really don't know how much I owe you! Aris. All this for me was... joy! Humans are the strangest creatures in nature. They're searching blindly, at the wrong place... for something that's there, in front of them. And in their panic to escape time, they hurt others and get hurt. But, as weak as they might be... when they are in love... they find the strength to forgive. And that's how, they heal their wounds. That is the magic of the human nature. RESTARTING
