There's been an accident. I think I need an ambulance, quick. All right, stay calm. Tell me what's happened. There's a-- Oh, God. Mm. I think he's dead. Fantastic song. Thanks for calling in with that one, Mr. Letitier. Great choice. Great choice indeed. Well, we still have just over an hour left together, and I promise, I'll be with you every minute of that hour until the very end. So, if you're just tuning in, welcome. Good morning. Glad you're with us. Let's get your day underway. Quick update on the road closures now. Breaking news. We've just had a call about a serious accident which took place last night. We're the very first to bring you this story. We can confirm the accident happened somewhere off the coast. There's currently one person in intensive care. Although their condition is unknown, it's believed they're struggling-- ...giving vital life support. We can only hope-- ...as with any event like that in this small community, it really is a tragedy. Everybody knows what happened-- ...family will obviously be devastated. Crowds are already gathering. The police are advising people to keep away. So, what's coming up next? Well, we'll be doing our daily quiz as usual. But first, more music. This is a good one.

No. Uh, I've been out most of the day. Aye? Looking for work? Yeah, I didn't think so. Grab me a beer out back. So, what's all this then? It's a new story I'm working on. Story? I'll tell you a story. Old man breaks his back while his son lounges about at home. Go on, then. Tell me the story. There was an accident last night. Down one of the bays. Just doing a bit of research on it, see if they were at the off-license or something. Been to Fermain. Had to cycle there. I couldn't find anything on it. But I was thinking maybe if I can just take some photos of the scene where it happened, -then I might be able to-- -How long were you down there? Most of the day. Could've done with a hand on the boat today. I mean, you-- you said you was busy. Well, I was busy. Well, busy doing what, Alex? Looking for what? What, chasing ambulances? Doing absolutely anything to say you made it in black and white? I need the story, Dad. It's for an application. Wake up, Alex. I don't know how to explain, but you're not going to-- It's the only thing I can do, Dad. Not gonna fight with you over this. I'm not angry. I-- I just worry. I mean, you li-- live in a fantasy world, boy. I mean, life isn't like one of your pictures. It isn't pretty. We don't control how or what. I know that, Dad. -I know. -Seems to me you've been sleeping through all of this. You've had everything you've ever needed handed right to you. You've been free to-- to sit on the beach and dream your big dreams of newspapers, cities, and-- and writing. No. While you're living here in my house, you'll be earning. And if that's on the boat with me, then so be it. -Don't want to. -What? I'm not trying to make you angry, Dad. -I know-- -I'm too tired for this now. See you in the morning. If you're up. Hello? Alex? Yeah, sure. I'll grab him now. Alex? Someone on the phone for you. - Who's this? - Hi, Alex. It's Karl from the National Press. Is now a good time to talk? Yeah, of course. How's it going? Uh, well, firstly, I want to say that we love the samples you've sent over so far and would like to offer you the position of junior reporter. Really? Ye-- Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's no worries, Alex. We have a fantastic office in the capital, and I'm sure you'll fit right in. Yes, of-- of course. Well, I hope so. One thing I do need from you, though, is some new writing material. Something a bit more outlandish than your typical work. It's an exercise we ask all our new writers to do. Like some kind of-- something bigger? - Right. - Well, uh, yes. Uh, th-- that's-- that's one way of putting it. I think I've got just the thing. Good. Good. Well, we, uh, look forward to reading it. Well, thanks for calling. - All right. Thanks. - Cheers. Who was that? It's this job I've been applying for. Who for? The National Press. National Press? Not a local paper? Yes. So, obviously, I have to move to the mainland. They're in one of the cities there. -I'll have to wait for-- -Well, why're you going there? Better shot, you know. I can't do what I really -want to do here. -No? I can't make a career reporting here. I don't know, what-- I don't know. Bit far, don't you think, for a job? Good change. It's this place, all right? I can't stand it. This place happens to be our home. It's not my home. Well, first Annie, and... well, now you. Oh, Christ, son. Are you so desperate to leave me -right here on my own? -I need my own life, Dad. And you don't want me to be part of that life, eh? Better cut him out at all costs. You just half make it tempting. I slave away every day, out at sea, in all weathers for you. I-- I blister my hands on ropes, and-- and slice my fingers on fish hooks all for you. I've built a whole life here for you, not for me. Yeah. I don't want it. All right, listen. I've lived here my whole life. .I mean, y-- your grandfather weren't a fisherman, okay? I mean, h-- he was into growing things. Tomatoes, all sorts. And-- and later on, some kind of-- some kind of flowers. 'Cause that's where the money was. It's not-- I'm not saying go into fishing. I'm not saying that. I mean, I'd love you to come out there with me and-- and get into fishing, but... If it's the press, well, it's the press. It's just... We were all born here. Uh, we never left the bay, as far as I'm aware. It's all here. This bay. Perelle. And you know, your kids are gonna wanna have what you had growing up. It's not fair, I mean, you've spent your whole life here. I can't do what I really want to do here. Imagine-- assume you couldn't fish here. You leave, right? Now, that's exactly what I'm saying. I-- I'd get a different job. Farming. Wh-- whatever gets me money to keep us going. -That's not how it works. -That's exactly how it works. Now, I gotta go out while the tide's still good. I'll be back later. Are you really going to give up on all this? The one part of my mother that stuck with me were her blue eyes that I always saw when I looked into the depth of the ocean. I often ask myself, what would I say if I saw her again? And more often fear if she would forget who I was if we met in another life. My days were limited, and I can only enjoy what time I have left basking in the sun and asking myself over and over, "What if?" -You hungry? -No, just a coffee's fine. Slice of cake? So, how's work been? This needs a bit more sugar. Uh, you don't need-- That's a bit much. How are things at the office? Yeah. Yeah, same as usual. Got this one client and she will not stop banging on about how much she misses her wife. I think it's, uh, do you remember Frasier... Frasier Turode from the year above? Well, it's his older sister. Yeah, bless her, but every time she comes in it's the same. But her wife's got a job at sea, so fair enough. You know? Can't imagine being away for that long. Gonna enjoy it. What, being away from me? Not that part. Is yours cold? Mine's a bit cold. Taken any good photos recently? Eh, no, not-- not in a while. Oh. I used to like it when you took mine. -Took your-- -My photo. Right, yeah. Look, Emily, I'm, uh-- I got that job on the mainland, so I'll probably-- So, you're going, then. Obviously, it's for work. I can't do what I really want to do here. You know, my dad always on my case, and... Well, I think it would be good for me. For us. We have everything we need right here. -You know, we just need to-- -Emily, uh, I-- I think I need some time away from here. You know, everything's stagnant. Always a repeat of the same. I like it like that. You know? It's comforting. We know what we've got. Can't stand it. Look, nothing ever changes. Everyone's always pleased, so easily satisfied with some mediocre office job. -What's wrong with that? -No, nothing. This isn't about you, Emily. I ca-- I can't... Well, it doesn't work for me, all right? I look around me and I can't see a single person's life I want. You know? It-- It's-- It's claustrophobic. Either everyone's in my face or I'm alone 'cause no one else seems to ever understand. It's just not enough for me, all right? It's not enough. Am I not enough? - Alex, we're lucky. - Lucky? We-- we're lucky. Okay, yeah, we're lucky. Yeah, okay, sure, we're lucky. Maybe in a way. But where do I go, huh? Why-- why do you want to complicate things? What am I complicating? I'm not complicating nothing. -It could be really simple. -I can see that. Here... there's no progression. Every time I catch up with people, it's uh-- they're-- they're the same old, nothing's happened since the last time we spoke, and it's-- it's sad. There's no progression, all right? Nothing ever changes. It's like-- It's like Josh. He, um... - Who's Josh? - Thompson. He-- He's-- He's just a bricklayer. He's just a bricklayer. There's nothing wrong with that. No, no, but he-- Obviously, yeah, it-- it's what he wants to do. I mean, that's fine. I-- - I don't care. - Well, you seem to care. No, no, m-- my point is, he seems fine with that. I mean, I-- I don't know the guy, but he must work hard. He could do anything. He could've done anything. He's like one of the smartest guys in school. Could've done anything. Well, maybe he didn't want to do anything else. Maybe. It's just so... simplistic, you get me? It's just staying here. On the island. It's the same people doing the same job he was born to do, then at the weekends, they drink themselves to sleep. It's always the same thing. You're still doing the same thing. Nothing changes here. Ever. Everyone's always exactly where you last left them. Quite literally, you bump into them at the same pub on Christmas Eve and that's it. Nothing ever changes. Why do you want it to? Alex, you seem really on edge. It's just... It's all been a bit much. You know? The last few weeks. I got this. Alex, I don't know if you're gonna hear this, but we're all here. Me, your dad. Whatever happens, if-- if you need a bit of time, we'll still be here. Just don't take too long. Look, I'm gonna go, but I'll see you before you leave, okay? You're leaving already? Yeah. It's time for me to go. I'm sorry. I-- I didn't mean to... Let's go for a walk. Yeah? It's an all right day for it. Something I'll miss. Imagine us living in a place like this. A girl can dream. We don't get paid to dream, Emily. One day we'll live in a house as nice as this. Trust me. Just a matter of time. Yeah? When? Once I've made it. Won't have to worry about the little things. I think you're getting a bit ahead of yourself. Bit too big for this island, eh? Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it. Dad. Found this on the beach. The one from the other day. My big story. This could be big. - Alex,. - No, no, no, listen, listen. The job needed something bigger. Something serious. And I think-- Well, I-- I think-- that there's really something here. -If I can just begin to-- -Pass the sandpaper. Right. I mean, look at the bloodstains. I think it's... Well, surely you should hand it in to the police - and tell them about it. - That's the thing. I think the police know. I think they could be covering up what really happened. We'd-- ah, you know. Would be likely to know. Think about it. Th-- they could be... What if the suspect is someone close to them? What if they're covering up what really happened, -waiting for it to blow over? -Alex, you need to drop this. You're-- you're getting carried away with all this-- this obsessing over little ideas. I think you're missing the bigger picture. You need to concentrate on yourself-- This is real, Dad! I heard it on the radio when it first happened and nothing since. Nothing since. Not-- not in the press- Have you ever stopped to think that maybe you need a story so badly you're making one up? Listen, I-- I'm trying to get a bit of downtime. Will-- can you leave this alone? You're not worried that there's a killer out there -who's just going to come-- -No, I'm more worried -about what's going on-- -Dad! You have to take this story seriously. This is my serious story, and I know it, trust me. I just have to figure out what really happened. What do we know? We know there was an accident. We know that. And now there's a knife with blood on it, we can-- We can't assume nothing. Th-- there's a fisherman's blade with blood on it that you found on the beach. That's all you got. Hardly surprising, isn't it? On an island where people fish that you found a fisherman's blade with blood on it. It's a coverup. When I first heard it on the radio I went straight to the scene where it happened, and they cleared it all away. I listen to the radio most of the day and I never heard nothing. W-- Well, there's a story there. Has to be. I'm missing something. What if it hasn't happened yet? What if he's waiting for this? It could be some kind of-- uh, it-- it could be a red herring. What, I'm-- I'm trying to piece together because that would explain why no one knows yet. I feel like the story seems out of sync. No, I don't think that's gonna be-- It is like déjà vu and then-- and then in reverse, and... None of this makes any sense. Just where are you headed? I need to think a few things through. My mind still thinks but my body won't listen. I'm trapped in a myriad of my old subconscious. And while the sun shines for a new day, I'm stuck here, subdued in a sea of disarray. You all packed, then? Pretty much. Just taking a big, like, travel rucksack. So, this is it. Are you going to miss it even a little bit? No. Can't wait to get out of here. Sorry, I-- I didn't mean it like that. I mean, obviously, yeah, I'll miss it a little. The place, and... Well, you were never going to be a fisherman, were you? Too busy taking photos of all the boats. And I don't blame you. I don't like the sea that much either. You hear things, don't you? People getting hurt out there. -What do you mean? -Oh, just stories. I mean, like your-- How is your dad? I don't know, to be honest. I-- He's been drinking a lot. A lot more than usual. It's things like that, that I need to get away from, but I'm sure he'll be fine. I suppose it's how he copes, isn't it? It's like my uncle. Is that the one with the cows and the-- Uh, yeah, yeah. Aw, do you remember that time he thought he could outrun me? He bet he could cross the field and get back again before we'd even notice. Was that at that family barbecue I took you to -when you first asked me out? -Yeah, five or six years ago. - Yeah. - Jeez. He-- he-- he tried to jump the fence, and I think he still had the bottle in his hand. No, no, no, he lobbed the bottle over the hedge. Oh, yeah, he saw the ball coming and he sprinted across, and then he threw the bottle. Yeah. Yeah, we all think we're heading for something different, but maybe there aren't a lot of options with paths in the end. That's what I've been saying. It's the choices. There's not that much to choose from here. I still love it here. Haven't really been anywhere else. Yeah, but why would I? This is my home. Everything I want and everyone I need is here. I have to get out. I just have to go. My story flopped. I don't know, maybe you look more into the knife thing before you leave. -No, the blade was just-- -No, trust me. Just think on it. And I-- I think I'm going to go home. Sure. Emily, I'm, uh-- I wanna come back and get you. I'm not gonna leave you here on your own. Thanks, Alex. But let's just see what happens. -You never know. -Yeah. You're-- It's, uh-- it's not just my choice. We'll see what happens. So-- maybe see you on the other side. Good luck. Try not to get too switched off. -What? -Well, you know, just don't take forever, that's all I'm saying. Come back when you can, okay? I'm gonna miss you. I'll see you soon. You've got a big future ahead of you, Alex. Emily, I-- I will be back. Yeah, I hope so. I'll see you soon, all right? No, you won't. Come on. You-- you honestly expect me to believe that you're not going to forget about me? Plenty of girls running about. You won't be able to remember my name after a week. Emily, it's not like that. We've been together since we were kids. Alex, I need you to promise me that you'll come back. I need you here. Yeah. I promise. Yeah? I couldn't imagine anyone else. Emily, I-- I wasn't gonna tell you this before I went, but, well, now seems like a good time. What? I want to get engaged. Once I've got set up on the mainland, I'm gonna come back for you and we're gonna start a new life. Alex, are you being serious? More serious than anything. Well? What do you say? - Yeah. - Yeah? All right? Can I help? Oh. Alex. Long time no see. How are you, young man? Yeah, it's been ages. How's everything with the shop? It's the same as last time you came in here. Not fishing with your old man any more? No. No, no. Not too much. Kind of focusing on other things recently. How is your dad? He popped in briefly last week to buy some new netting. Yeah, well, he's doing all right, all things considering. Yeah, well, keeping himself busy, I'm sure. Not one for idle hands. So, uh, one of the best crabbers I've ever seen, you know. I'm sure he is. Hm. You know, I've asked him a few times to help me out in the store. He's getting a bit old to be at sea every day. Looking for any part-time work? Uh, no, not quite. Look, Andy, I, um, I found this on the beach the other day. And, uh, well, I think it may have been used in some kind of a crime of some sorts. It's a-- it's a story I'm trying to cover. It looks like the knives I used to see here -when I came with my dad. -Alex. What are you doing here? You're trying to stir up trouble? No, I just thought you might be able to help me with this. Well, I don't recollect selling it. But it's definitely one-- Alex, like I said, it's not one of mine! You probably know yourself whose it is. Listen, son, don't go messing with things, yeah? Eh? You're just gonna cause upset. And don't mention this to your old man! He's got enough on his mind. -Better give back to me. -No, that's all right! Come here! Think it's safe with me. You're late. Think you can just walk in like that? -Alex, I'm talking to you. -What is it, Dad? Well, what do you think you're doing, coming in at this time? Been sorting a few things out. Sorry. Who do you think you are? You know, you live another life. I'm not sure who you are half the time. I'm asking where'd you been. I was at Andy's store. -Andy's? -Yeah. Right, well, what've you been doing there? Showing him this. Damn it, Alex. This investigation's over. It ends now. I'm-- I'm fed up with your games. I mean, you-- you've been poking your nose in where it shouldn't have been and it's gone too far. I don't care if it is your passion. This stops now! Do you hear me, Alex? What's so special about this knife that Andy doesn't want me to know about? What are you hiding from me? This-- this isn't important. I mean, you're going delirious, son, you know that? This whole damn thing's making you crazy. Who are you to tell me what to do? You never showed any interest in my stories 'til now. You were never around. Mum raised me, she always supported what I wanted to do. I-- I wasn't around 'cause-- 'cause I was out working, remember? Trying to provide for you. Yeah. Sure. You know, it's easy for you to just stand there and tell me what to do because everything-- everything you do was just given to you. You never had to chase for anything that wasn't just straight in front of you. You know, I-- I don't-- I don't just sit out there on a porch, watching the tide go out and waiting for it to come back in. You know, I investigate. I think. You just sit 'round here untying one rope while you're drinking a couple of beers. And then for a couple of hours a day, you and your mates take your boat and you fly around the bay. Oh, not much of a catch today. Nice one, Dad. Why's that, then, huh? Why are you not catching fish? Something happened on this island. I haven't figured it out just yet. But I'm gonna figure this out. I'm gonna figure it out. Do you hear me, Dad? You know... you've never helped me with anything. Right from when I was little. Mum read with me. She showed me the world. She showed me how the world works. And you just-- you just showed me this bay and how to flip a few rocks. What good is that, huh? I don't have to prove anything to you. I don't. Why should I follow what you did? You've done nothing to me. Nothing! Just let me do what I have to do. So, now we know where we stand. I'm not holding you back anymore. Door's open. Already lost one person I loved. Won't be so hard the second time 'round. My mother always read poetry to me. Now her words make sense. They're all I hear. The only voice I remember. I want to tell you what is known by the ocean. That life in its jewel box is as endless as the sand. Countless and pure. And among the blood-dripping grapes time has polished the hardness of a petal. Made a jellyfish full of light. And with a bouquet of the coral threads, its knots untied, a musical thread falls from a horn made of an infinite mother-of-pearl. And nothing, but the empty net which has gone on ahead of human eyes... dead in the dim light, with fingers accustomed to the triangle, longitude of the shy globe of an orange. I was like you. Investigating the endless star. And in my net, at night... I woke up naked. All that was caught, a fish trapped in the wind. Can't sleep? Uh, no. Bit warm. I had a weird dream. Going back to bed? Sit with me if you can't sleep. Might as well spend some time together while we still can. Sure. I'll sit for a bit. Why's the sound off? Always have it off at night. Don't want to keep you up. I noticed you've been waking a lot. Nightmares? I know we haven't... really spoken about her passing away. But believe me... it's been hard. Oh, I miss her too. And I know I've been hard on you. I don't want to let you slip away. Just not-- I'm not-- I'm not ready just yet for it to be me. Do you see what I'm saying? I promised I would do everything right. To keep us... this family... together. To keep you from leaving. I know you want to chase this job, well... what's the point of all this? I worked... so hard to build a family. Now, I've nothing to show for it. Just a-- a dead wife... - and the son who-- - Dad, it's-- No. Listen. A son that acts as if I'm dead most of the time. This house. This bay. My life. It's nothing, really. And I would give everything... to have the three of us back together... like it used to be. Dad, I'm sorry. I am, but... I have to do this. It's what Mum would have wanted. I have to leave the island. I know, son. I know. I don't want your last memories of home to be like this. Uh, why-- why why don't we go out in the boat again tonight, eh? Like old times. You can pretend to be a kid again and... I'll pretend like I haven't made so many stupid mistakes. You'll miss the open ocean in the big city. - I know that. - I'm not sure, Dad. -Now's bit late. -Ah, get out of it. We'll have the bay to ourselves. It's a long time overdue. Us having a drink together. Mum. No. No! Here, son. Have a drink. Put you right. How do you drink this? Gets better as you get through. Sure it does. You know, growing up, I couldn't wait to get on the boat with my pa. Hearing his stories, learning about his adventures. Problem now is kids have got too many choices. Always got their head stuck here and there. Don't pay attention to what really matters. Like what? This. Our culture. Our heritage. Growing up, it felt an honor to consider myself a fisherman. No one takes you serious now. It's not too late to do something new. Like what? Alex, I'm not young anymore. You got the rest of your life to make decisions. I don't. You think your old man's a bum, don't you, huh? I never said that. Just beautiful, isn't it? You know, people in your life will come and go. The sea's always the same. One thing you'll never understand, Alex. The scum. You know what I mean when I say scum, eh? You do, don't you, eh? They're everywhere. It's everywhere. I mean, you leaving the island won't change that. It isn't any better over there. They're just the same as us. And they look down at us in their glass houses... but we're all the same. Sinners. That's not why I'm leaving. Why, huh? For the life of me, I don't understand why you want to leave your father. I've offered you a paradise and a good home to grow up in. I can't go on like this. Speak up. You can speak with me, no? I can't just-- Or am I just gonna stand here, me-- me talking, and-- and-- and you with your eyes half-shut? In the mornings, I feel-- I feel like I can't wake up. Especially when it feels-- Sometimes it feels like I can't keep pushing. Especially when you ask me to. Since Mum died, I don't feel like this is... home... anymore. This isn't my home anymore. I can't be here without her. How do you think I feel, eh? Huh? You never asked how your old man feels about any of this. She was mine. I think you forget that. I loved her my whole life. She was everything to me. I lived my life for her. And you're all she left behind. -I can't stay. -You said. Yeah, and what happened to you accepting that? -I can't stay. -And me? -What do you mean, you? -Do I stay here forever? Do what you want. When you're a father, you don't do what you want. You do what's best for your family. Well, this is what's best for me, Dad, all right? I don't know how to tell you that. This is what's best for me! Oh, well done, son. You're a big, strong man now, then, eh? Don't need your old man no more. What's best for you? How does it feel like, eh? To be the big guy? Dad, stop it, you're drunk. Just focus on the boat. Ah, come on, Alex. Let's have a laugh on your last night, no? I've had enough, just turn the boat around -and take us back in. -Take us in? No, I want to go out further. -That's what I want. -That's enough. You want the flask? Here, take it. Think you're bigger than me? Think you're better than me? I'm an old fool, pissing his life away. You think living here is pain? You don't know what half the feeling of pain is. I had it all! The love of my life. And now she's gone! And this is the only thing that numbs the pain. Not my son! Look at me! You listening to me? -Get off of me! -Huh? Oh, if you can't square up to a fisherman, how are you gonna handle the big thing city, son? Get away from me, Dad. You're drunk. -You wanna get 'round me? -Get off me, Dad! -Dad! -No! I said no. -Come on! Man up! Man up! -Dad! Man up! I was once told happiness is the relief from pain. I know my mother felt an eternity of agony before her death, but now she's free. All I can do is look back at my life for what it is. A story. A character's fate is always unclear, but the words live for eternity. I think that's what drew me to being a writer. As I take my fall... let those be my final words. Right. ♪ I didn't care where she wanted to go ♪ ♪ As long as I was by her side ♪ ♪ She took me into the woods ♪ ♪ To a place that we could reside ♪ ♪ And we lit the fire ♪ ♪ And it burned all night like our glowing desire ♪ ♪ And then she took me to her room ♪ ♪ Where I stopped, she presumed and said ♪ ♪ Be my love ♪ ♪ And I'll take you to the bottom of the ocean ♪ ♪ Take your time with me ♪ ♪ And I know you're hurt ♪ ♪ Well, I am too, we're as delicate as one another ♪ ♪ And I know we can pull through together ♪ ♪ Shrugged it off and began to cry ♪ ♪ I could see that twinkle in her eye ♪ ♪ The warm hands gave me quite the fright ♪ ♪ As we moved further into the night ♪ ♪ And we beg and plead ♪ ♪ Well, oh, my dear, this is what you just don't need ♪ ♪ She's pooled out naked on the floor ♪ ♪ But I wanted more ♪ ♪ I said be my love ♪ ♪ And I'll take you to the bottom of the ocean ♪ ♪ Take your time with me ♪ ♪ And I know you're hurt ♪ ♪ But I am too, we're as delicate as one another ♪ ♪ And I know we can pull through together ♪ ♪ Be my love ♪ ♪ Well, I'll take you to the bottom of the ocean ♪ ♪ Take your time with me ♪ ♪ And I know you're hurt ♪ ♪ Well, I am too, we're as delicate as one another ♪ ♪ And I know we can pull through together ♪
