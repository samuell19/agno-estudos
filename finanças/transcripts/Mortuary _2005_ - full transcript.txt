[screams] [music playing] [train horn] [sigh] There'll be right in the house? All the way down in the basement. You'll never see them. But you will? Yep, when I go to work. Are they scary? No, honey, not at all. 26-hour car ride just flew by. It speaks! [giggle] That's got to be some kind of record for you. Six hours? Look, it was an opportunity. I had to take it. It's the reason I went back to school. It's a new career for me and a new start for us. [cackling laughter] You made it! LESLIE: Yeah. Wow. Phew! You made it. Finally. Elliott, good to see you. Good to see you. Good. I'm sorry we're late. We got stuck on the interstate. Oh, no apology necessary. You're here. Oh, this is my son, Jonathan. Elliott Cook. And my daughter, Jamie. Hi, Jamie! Well, come on. Be careful. The septic tank overflowed. You know, we've had more rain this season than we've had in half a century. There might be just an itty bitty bit of mold in the house now. LESLIE: No problem. Now, you've got a lease with an option to buy. So technically the maintenance is up to you. But I'd get this septic tank pumped out as soon as possible. This thing probably hadn't been emptied in 50 years. Mm. Do all the drains go there? Even the mortuary facilities? Yes. I don't even want to think about what's jammed down there. [laughter] LESLIE: OK. ELIOT COOK: You know what? I've got a friend that can do it. He's expensive, but worth it. Here's his number. Just give him a call. LESLIE: Wow. OK, guys. This is uh-- this is cool. This is going to be cool. I'm going to put in a-- put in a lawn. And we can play croquet. ELIOT COOK: [laughter] LESLIE: Looks like we need some stairs here. ELIOT COOK: Here we are. The moving van came yesterday. Everything's unloaded. Great job labeling those boxes, Leslie. JAMIE: This is where they took Daddy? Oh no, honey. Come here. Come here. Come on. ELIOT COOK: Had a lot of plumbing work and wiring, electrical work. And let's take a look at the kitchen in here. Follow me. [cackling laughter] LESLIE: Come on, honey. Let's go. Let's go this way. Come on. ELIOT COOK: Come on in. Come on in, kids. LESLIE: Oh my. JONATHAN: This is disgusting. Mom-- ELIOT COOK: Well, it's nothing a little elbow grease can't take care of. [chuckle] You know, it's not as bad as it looks. A little paint and a little scrubbing here and there. And it will be good as new. JONATHAN: Oh my god. We're supposed to eat here? LESLIE: I thought you said this was going to be cleaned up, that you had some sort of prison work group. ELIOT COOK: Yeah. We were supposed to get these prisoners. But they wouldn't let us expose them to the chemicals that are here. Can you believe that? LESLIE: Oh my god. ELIOT COOK: Prisoners exposed to chemicals. It's silly, isn't it? But it's-- you know--not as bad as it looks. [chuckle] [suspenseful music] [heavy breathing] JAMIE: Daddy. [creak] JAMIE: [scream] LESLIE: Honey, you OK? Are you OK? ELIOT COOK: Oh, goodness. Oh no. Did that mean old coffin jump down there and scare you? Oh. Well, that's a good lesson for you. Just remember, curiosity kills the cat. [chuckle] LESLIE: We got to stay out of here, sweetie. OK? You're OK. ELIOT COOK: She's all right. Here, here's a stick of gum. Just chew on that. Go ahead, take it. You know, they opened up another nursing home since you were here last. A county home. Cha ching. LESLIE: Really? ELIOT COOK: Oh yeah. Not to mention, we've got the most dangerous highway in the state out there. Believe me, you'll have lots of business. LESLIE: Well, I'll only be to process at first. ELIOT COOK: That's all it needs. Just processing. JONATHAN: Oh gosh. [suspenseful music] [click] [creak] LESLIE: Jonathan? JONATHAN: Jesus. LESLIE: I'm sorry. JAMIE: Why are you guys standing in the dark? Can I have this room? LESLIE: Sure. JAMIE: Why is is like a jail? LESLIE: You mean the bars on the windows? I don't know. How are you gonna make this work? Hm? I mean, seriously. Oh Come on. When have I ever let you down before? For starters, how about the time you moved me across the country in the middle of my school year, decide you suddenly had some calling? You just wait till I get this place going. Thought about renaming it yet? You know, like, death for less, something snappy like that? Watch it, or you'll be out of my will. JONATHAN: Discount Death Mart. LESLIE: Ha, ha, ha. JONATHAN: Has a nice ring. LESLIE: Funny. [train sounds] LESLIE: Hi. Needs a lot of work, doesn't it? [exhalation] Can I get the keys, please? LESLIE: Where are you going? Why would you bring her down here? She's just helping me. JAMIE: Yeah. Besides, Mom said it was OK if there weren't any dead people. JONATHAN: Oh, did she? JAMIE: Yeah. JONATHAN: Got a lot of salt. LESLIE: It's rock salt. They use it to make ice cream. [grunt] Somebody must have really loved it here. Can I have some? LESLIE: Mm hm. Mm. LESLIE: What flavor? - How about chocolate? - You know what? I'm going to go get a burger or something. So can I get the keys from you? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Thanks. Did you guys want anything, or-- Uh, actually, yes. Can you get some bottled water and milk? And Jonathan, I really appreciate what you're doing. [traffic sounds] [rock music on radio] LESLIE: Ouch! Damn it! [drip] [suspenseful music playing] [loud rock music on radio] No, I don't know. Who's that? Oh. Kitchen's closed, dearie. What you looking for? Just anything that looks like dinner. Well, I'll tell you what. I got about three turkey sandwiches left over from lunch. How would that be? That would be great. All right. I'll get them. OK. Excuse me. Could I get an application? [laughter] You know what? You have a good aura. I'll tell you what. Stop by tomorrow, we'll give it a try. You like it, I like you, the job's yours. Great OK. Groovy then JONATHAN: Thanks. [laughter] Hey there. I'm Jonathan Doyle. I just moved here. So. [laughter] Good one. All right. Here you go. No. On the house. Oh no. You sure? Yeah, yeah. See you tomorrow. JONATHAN: Are you sure? - Positive. Out of here. Bye. OK. Thank you. Thanks. Bye. Bye. [laughter] [crickets] [footsteps in leaves] [suspenseful music playing] JONATHAN: [snort] Fuck you, you stupid piece of shit. [running footsteps] [running footsteps] [suspenseful music playing] [running footsteps] [birds screeching] [flies buzzing] LESLIE: Embalmimg. Kitchen. Kitchen. Embalming. Kitchen. Definitely kitchen. OK. [rattling door] LESLIE: [sigh] [clatter] Oh shit. [sigh] [suspenseful music playing] [coughing] Ew. [thump] LESLIE: Ow! Damn it! JONATHAN: Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Mom, do you know there was somebody out in the front yard-- excuse me. I mean grave yard last night? Yeah, you running around at 2:00 AM. It is just tobacco you're smoking, right? Busted. OK. Uh-- uh-- First of all, I stopped smoking cigarettes. And-- Yeah, right. Come on, come on. What? LESLIE: You know what. Hand it over. Hand it over. Come on. Uh-- I don't have cigarettes. But here's a lighter. Mom, there were somebody in the graveyard chasing me around. Look. Here, I uh-- I found this. Can I wear it? You can put it in with the rest of your costumes. Well, you know, it's a graveyard. We're not in a great neighborhood. Take a baseball bat next time. Where are you going? I got a job. What about becoming my assistant? Like that's ever going to happen. How about me? [sigh] OK. So you rinse it out like that. Got that? Yeah. Take the grinds, dump them in there. And then you're set to go again. OK? Breakfast special. Mm. Thanks, hon. You know, when you've had as many drugs as I have, you pretty much can eat anything you want. [cackle] That's my niece, Liz. She's purty, huh? Liz, say hi or something. Jonathan. I know. You live in the graveyard. How cool is that? Yeah, it's great. Bet your septic tank backed up with all that rain, huh? There's all kinds of shit in this town. I hope our septic tank isn't the most interesting thing to talk about around here. Um-- I don't know if you-- if you're-- Hey, Grady! Hi! Mm. This is Jonathan. Mm. That'd be me. Grady, you want usual? You know it. OK, kid. Show time. Here we go. [laughter] [chatter] CAL: Hey. How you doing? So you seen Bobby yet? Excuse me? Hey, mortuary boy don't know who Bobby is. Bobby Fowler. Oh, that Bobby. How long have you guys been dating? TINA: Ow! Whoo! [ANGRILY] What are you cocksuckers doing fighting in my GD place of business? Cal, get on out of here! Go! Goddamn, Rita, he started it! Out! Get! Come on, baby. Get your jacket. Prick. Sorry about this. No. Stop, stop, stop. Listen. Cal won't get his head out of his ass till the day put him in the ground. Now you OK? Aw, forget about him. They're a bunch of assholes! Language. Sorry, Rita. So who's Bobby Fowler? [music playing] Jamie. What you doing? JAMIE: They might get hungry. LESLIE: Oh, OK. Did you open that? Nope. Want a piece? Do you mind saving it for me for later? Why don't you go inside, though, and change your pants. You are covered in mud. OK. LESLIE: OK. I'll be right in. [suspenseful music playing] 1905. Wow. 1922. [lighter click] That which is dead cannot eternal lie. With strange eons even death may die. Huh. [keys jangling] [clank] SHERIFF HOWELL: Mrs. Doyle? JAMIE: Mom! Mom! LESLIE: Hold on. Mom! SHERIFF HOWELL: Glen Howell, the sheriff. Welcome to our little municipality. Oh, thank you. Please, call me Leslie. Can I back inside? Sure. Now, Leslie, I-- I-- I want to make a formal welcome and let you know that business and government are like a family here. We support each other. Oh. Well, Eliot Cook offered to hook me up with this nursing home. Eliot Cook is a blight on the city of Santa Lorena. The day he got elected to city council is the blackest day in our history. Right. Sorry. Uh-- you were saying? Um-- now, Leslie-- um-- uh-- I hope you understand that this setting is a natural magnet for young people. They play their games, make their dares, but always end up here. Local boys seem to think that nothing impresses the ladies more than wandering around the graveyard. Right. Right. OK. I'll keep my eye open. Together we can stop graveyard babies. Excuse me? The young men bring their young women here because nothing encourages closeness like a little fear. So they get them scared and then they get intimate. OK. Graveyard babies. Good. Um-- here's my card. Have any problems, just give me a call. You got it. Good. LIZ: The Fowlers have always been part of Santa Lorena. They were one of the first families to settle here back when it was nothing but ranches. GRADY: Cattle as far as the eye can see. LIZ: Let me tell it. OK. So. Zebediah Fowler came out here to get into the cattle business, like everyone else. That's where the money was. Problem was, nothing grew on his land. There was something in the soil-- something bad. [door opening] Rita! I'm telling the Fowler story. Lizzie! I'm bringing out brownies for you and your friends. GRADY: Yeah, I'll have one. RITA: See? Gracious, nice. LIZ: Can I tell the damn story? RITA: Yes. Bobby Fowler's still alive, you know? Where was I? GRADY: Something bad in the soil. Right. Zeb's cattle started dying, rotting in the fields. And he was scraping by serving as the town's undertaker. He built the graveyard. And the Fowlers have been morticians from there on out. So, Bobby-- LIZ: Oh, right. The mortuary passed through Zeb's family until 1962. Emeline and Franklin Fowler own it. And they're the last ones in the Fowler line except for-- Bobby. GRADY: Bingo. LIZ: But Bobby is never going to grow up and have kids, because he's horribly deformed. Cleft palate, mute, hands all messed up. And his parents abused the shit out of him. Chains, matches, embalming tools. Everyone knows it. But no one can prove it. And when Bobby's eight-- poof! He disappears. His parents killed him? GRADY: That's what everyone thought. But-- LIZ: 10 years later, Emeline and Franklin Fowler were found with their heads bashed in. Ever since then, people have said that Bobby's still alive. They locked him in a tomb, but he survived. He only comes out at night. GRADY: He's used to living in graves. His skin is ghostly white. And he can see in the dark. And over his face, he wears a stained burial shroud. [crash] LIZ: [scream] JONATHAN: [gasp] Shit. [laughter] [train sounds] [interposing voices] Ow! Bitch! CAL: Shut the hell up. Why? CAL: Because he's living right there. Gonna get you. You. CAL: Where's that uh-- where's the spray paint? Give me that. I don't want to disintegrate any graves. [chuckling] CAL: Disintegrate. It's desecrate, you idiot. Hey. Don't call her that. CAL: It's a good thing you're hot, baby. Come here. Mm. Mm. [kissing sounds] [scream] CAL: Boy, that was nice, huh? TINA: Mm. SARAH: Wait, wait, whoa. TINA: Oh, Cal. SARAH: Wait, wait. Stop. [scream] TINA: Fucking drunk. TINA: You all want to get a room? Really? CAL: Here. Take this. Get started. And keep it down, all right? I got to take a piss. All right. TINA: Hey, take this. CAL: Yeah. Thanks. TINA: OK. Come on, babe. Get started. Come on. Let's go. Um, Cal-- Are you kidding me? What the hell is wrong with you? Wait, wait. [scream] Hey, bitch. Back off! Stop, it's an angel. [laughter] Hey, watch me. OK. [zipper unzipping] How you doing tonight, Cheryl? Sorry. I mean Miss Warner. You know I got my ass kicked for that F. Thanks. That daughter of yours is getting pretty hot. How old is she? 15 now? [zipper zipping up.] You have a good night. Bitch. Baby! Sarah. Goddamn it, Sarah. Baby. Sarah? Come on. Come on. CAL: Jeez. [interposing voices] SARAH: These are so old. Really old. You guys are like rabbits. [laughter] TINA: Go take his. SARAH: Give me your flashlight. [laughter] I can't see anything. CAL: Baby, watch your step. TINA: Watch it! SARAH: I'm scared. [interposing voices] Look, guys. It's a-- it's a tomb. Cal, this is freaky. It's like someone lives here. CAL: You think so? SARAH: Well, hey there. CAL: You know what? SARAH: I'm scared. CAL: I think we found that uh-- that room we were looking for. SARAH: Really? CAL: Yeah. [thumping] Hey! Wake up, boy. It's the police. TINA: What the fuck are you doing? SARAH: Cal, my god. CAL: You know what? I'm tired of your mouth. Let me put it to good use, all right? SARAH: It's kind of dark in here. [moaning] SARAH: Oh, oh, Cal. TINA: All right. CAL: What the hell? TINA: Hey, what's taking so long? Usually takes you about two minutes anyway. CAL: Well, I'll tell you what. You want to join in too, that'll make it about four minutes. TINA: Hey, you can count. SARAH: And he's smart, too. [crash] [screaming] [train sounds] LIZ: So It's cool inside? JONATHAN: Definitely. Definitely. And I moved into Bobby's old room. There was all these bars on the windows and-- LIZ: Get out of here! Hey. Bobby's still alive, you know. Yeah. He lives in one of the tombs. That's just a story. RITA: No. Uh uh. I see him out back by the dumpsters rooting through there. I think he prefers the leftover cream pie. Oh, really? RITA: Oh, yeah. You know, the Fowler place has always been weird. I think nobody's lived there since uh-- since-- um-- shit! God! I just-- you know, my memory is a complete blank between the Kennedy and Reagan administrations. The CIA administered LSD tests. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. So, how's the embalming room? Oh, they have like these-- like these weird things that you can like-- realign the broken bones. And there's a drain in the middle of the floor for all the like-- blood and guts and that kind of stuff. Can I see it? I thought you'd never ask. Cool. [train sounds] [interposing voices] LIZ: All right, all right, all right. So, did you get any? GRADY: Yeah. I hooked it up with Charlie. LIZ: Hm. Charlie, huh? GRADY: I wouldn't go to Trixie. She's whacked out. LIZ: No she's not. She has good stuff. GRADY: Oh, come on! She's a wacko! LIZ: Shut up. She's my friend. GRADY: Nah. She's a complete wacko. Do you remember what she did to you two years ago? She did not pull the dress down on purpose. And that wasn't two years ago. That was what-- that was last year or something. No? No, We didn't go last year. We went up to Santa Cruz for that balloon festival thing. Nuh uh. That was two years ago. No. You're losing your mind. No, you are. So how long-- how long have you two been dating for? How long have you like, been together? Uh-- [laughter] What? Dude, you-- it wouldn't work. I'm gay. What? Are you serious? That's great. That's great. Why do you want to know? Hm? No. I mean, I was just-- uh-- She's a great kisser. We fooled around in 5th grade. Shut up! We're in business. Two bodies came in. Bodies? Uh, Liz, Grady, this is-- this is my mother. She's the happy mortician. Can we see them? Uh-- uh-- well. Hm. I don't know. LIZ: Come on, please? LESLIE: You know, I don't-- LIZ: I may want to do this for a living. LESLIE: I don't even know if this is really legal. Oops. No. Not that one. Are you sure you want to see this? Yeah. All right. Oh god. That's-- that's Mr. Barstow. He's my piano teacher! GRADY: Hey, it's OK. It's OK. Let's get out of here. LESLIE: I am so sorry. LIZ: But-- JONATHAN: Oh, she knows him? LIZ: I have a lesson tomorrow. JONATHAN: She-- I am so sorry. Mom! It's my first embalming. I'm just excited. I get that. Just-- you don't have to, like, announce it to the world. You know? LESLIE: I'm really sorry. [sigh] Shit! How did I know it was her piano teacher? Sorry about my mother. I'm sorry about your piano teacher. I-- It was real. He's dead. GRADY: I uh-- say it's time for a little mood-altering substance. You OK with that? Yeah. Input at the femoral artery. Check. Output at the jugular. Aw, damn it. Rigor mortis. Rigor mortis. Move the head in a lateral direction. [grunting] [crack] Good god! All right. OK. [whirring noise] [suction] Oh, that blood is not moving. OK. Let's increase the pressure. All right. [faster whirring noise] OK. [sloshing sound] Aye, aye god! OK. Shit! Oh, shit! I forgot the clamps. [squelching sound] Oh god! [rock music] [coughing] [doorbell] Wait a minute. Oh shit! Goddamn it! [doorbell] LESLIE: Wait a minute! Shit! SHERIFF HOWELL: Mrs. Doyle? - Shit! Shit! Shit! Do not tell him I'm here. Guy's just waiting to bust me. LIZ: Put it out! [doorbell] Hey! Could somebody get that, please? [interposing voices] LIZ: Under the bed! Under the bed! LESLIE: Jamie, tell Jonathan to get the door. Mom wants you to answer the door. JONATHAN: Don't come in my room without knocking! JAMIE: What's that smell? You can't go down like that. What? Take your clothes off. [doorbell] Hang on, please! Hang on! Oh, goddamn. [doorbell] [gurgling sound] Shit! Oh my god! Oh god! [machine stops] God. [doorbell] Hang on! [crackling sound] [suspenseful music] [doorbell] What! Oh. Hi. Oh. Oops. Sorry. SHERIFF HOWELL: Leslie, this will just take a moment. I-- I-- I-- I need to talk to your son. Anything serious? SHERIFF HOWELL: I need to ask him a few questions. Oh. OK. Sure. Yeah. Jonathan! Will you come down here, please? OK? OK. SHERIFF HOWELL: Nice landscaping. Oh, thank you. Yeah, it does liven the place up a bit, doesn't it? SHERIFF HOWELL: Yes, it does. Is that fescue or bluegrass? All right. All right. Turn. - OK. Shit. - Good. That's good. That's good. - Oh, shit. All right. Go. Oh, Jonathan. This is Sheriff Howell. He came by to ask you a few questions. Have you seen Robert Calvin lately? He's commonly referred to as Cal. Uh-- I mean-- I mean-- I've seen him like, around. Did you see him last night? No. Are you sure? Yeah. Your son got into fisticuffs with Mr. Calvin. Now he and two of his friends are missing. You what? Mom, it was-- it was nothing. Nothing? On the contrary, this community takes violence very seriously. Now did you see Mr. Calvin last night? No! LESLIE: OK. Look. I will handle this with my son. Trust me. But if he says he didn't see anybody, I believe him. SHERIFF HOWELL: Well, if you remember anything, let me know. Leslie, do you mind if I take a look around the place? Maybe out in the cemetery? Be my guest. Thank you. What a mess. LESLIE: Fighting? Why? He attacked me. Well, that doesn't mean you have to stoop to his level. So I'm not supposed to be a man and defend myself? Being a man doesn't mean punching someone. It means doing the right thing. There's no point in even talking about this, because you don't fucking get it. You're on chores till tonight. First vandalism. Then babies. Oh my goodness. [creak] [suspenseful music] JONATHAN: Shit. LESLIE: This stuff's all over the place. JONATHAN: Did you call that guy about the septic tank? [screaming] He's in my closet! He's in my closet! LESLIE: Sh, sh. Come here, come here. He's there! He's there! The scary man! Bobby Fowler! He was in my closet! Honey, I can't understand. He's in my closet! He's in my closet! - Wait. OK. Calm down. He was there! He's gonna get me! No, no. Nobody's gonna get you. Sh. Wait, wait. JAMIE: He's gonna get me! Sweetheart. Sweetheart, come here. Come here. Come here. It's OK. It's OK. Nobody's in here. OK. He said he can see in the dark. He can find me anywhere. No, no, sweetheart. Jonathan and I would never ever let anybody hurt you. Right? Right. [sobbing] And he was there. Right there. LESLIE: Shh. And he took my necklace! Jame, is this from one of your costumes or something? JAMIE: No. He was wearing it on his face. [bell jingling] [phone ringing] Hey, did your mom smell the pot? We were afraid we got you into more trouble. Well, if she did, she let it slide. So. Maybe I could meet her again sometime. I mean, if you ever want to hang out. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That would be-- that would be great. I mean, you know, you can-- you can come over whenever you want. So. That is what you meant, right? - Right. - Right. OK. As long as there are no dead bodies. OK? No dead bodies. I promise. OK. So. Well, how about your dad? Can I meet him? He uh-- he's actually not really around anymore. He passed away. Sorry I-- No, it's-- Jonathan? Yeah. I just wanted to say-- What? That. Oh. When can we get out of here? [hissing sound] [tapping] Oh my god! What the hell happened to you guys? Give me the usual. Nice dress. You look hot. [coughing] I thought you were missing. Shut up, punk. [coughing] Shut up, punk. Shit. Shut up, punk! Shut up, punk! Shut up, punk! RITA: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's wrong with her? Call a doctor or something. - Shut up! - What the fuck? Hey! Hey! Calm down. Holy shit! That is like some really bad shit. What did you give her! Look at-- oh shit. Get a broom! Call the ambulance. Do something! Oh my god! What the fuck did you give her, man? [screaming] Oh! So wrong! She threw up on your Aunt Rita? Direct hit in the face, right in the mouth. She's been having acid flashbacks for an hour. Oh! So what do you think they were on? Duh. [loud rock music] Hang on, Rita. RITA: Oh god. Oh, it's dark. I want the colors back. Oh, I remember him. Oh. And then, you know-- after it was over, they just got up and left, you know, like nothing had ever happened. Really? LIZ: Rita! RITA: Ow! Oh. Oh fuck. [whistling] LESLIE: Don't you worry. I'm going to make you look beautiful so your family can say goodbye. [whistling] [banging] One second! OK. Be right back. Oops. OK. [banging] ELIOT COOK: Hey! Got you some croakers. [laughing] Big mess on the highway yesterday. Come on out. Bring them in here, boys. Big 18-wheeler hit a little tiny Datsun. I bet you heard the crash. Actually, I didn't. No. But Eliot, my tables are full right now. I mean, thank god. But-- You know, the county only pays $200 a head. I got him up to $400 for you. I mean, Leslie, where do you want the bodies? Uh-- OK. Yeah. Follow me. Bring them in right here. ELIOT COOK: [laughter] Good thinking, Leslie. You've got creativity and business savvy in equal measure. Very attractive. So, you think they'll be fine here? No problem. I'll have my son help me move them later. Good, good. You know, I could probably unload these caskets for you for $100 a pop. Really? Great. You just leave it to me. It's good doing business with you, Leslie. You're a beautiful-- Oh! Eliot! [coughing] So I guess I'll see you soon. Yeah. Good enough. Take care. Come on! Get that out of here! What are you hanging around for? Let's go! OK. Bye bye. It's so good to see you again. [violent coughing] All right. OK. Not bad. [ripping sound] Oh. Not good. [gasping] [wah] [wah] Jamie Q, what are you doing out here? JAMIE: Dancing. I'm gonna make the grass grow. You're gonna make the grass grow? Am I a lamb? [chuckle] What? Where did that come from? Mom says I'm a lamb. Well, she's right, cutey pie. You're a regular lamb chop. LESLIE: Jonathan? Oh. Hi. You brought your friends. You'll stay for dinner, won't you? Sure. Great. Well, come in before it burns. LESLIE: Sit. Sit. Please, sit down. You here. You here. Young lady and Jonathan. Oh. Ready in a moment. So we'll start with soup. You made soup? LESLIE: Mm hm. Mm mm mm! Mm! I'll have water. Thank you. [THREATENINGLY] You will drink milk. Now. Let's all join hands and say what we're thankful for. Elizabeth, we'll start with you. I'm thankful for-- Um-- new friends. Aw. Old friends are-- Do not speak out of turn. Next. Give thanks. I wish Daddy was here. Oh, sweetheart. I know. I miss him too. Those last few days were-- were so nice. Let's eat. Mm, mm, mm. Mm, mm, mm. Mm, mm, mm, mm. Soup is so good. [sizzling] It's seasoned perfectly! Mom! Mom, please. Please.

LESLIE: Stay! Stop! GRADY: What the fuck is this shit! What the fuck is it! JONATHAN: I don't know! I don't know! JAMIE: [screaming] Jamie, Jamie! You have to come home sometime. JAMIE: [screaming] JONATHAN: Jamie, Jamie, Jamie! Jamie! JAMIE: [crying] JONATHAN: I don't know what the fuck is going on. GRADY: You and Jamie better stay with us. LIZ: You can't go back there. She'll kill you! [screaming] Hold it! Hold it! Move! Move, move, move, go! LIZ: Oh my god! JONATHAN: Oh god, no! LIZ: OK. Guys! Guys! Over here. Rita was right. He lives here. Bobby Fowler lives here. JONATHAN: Jamie, Jamie, don't-- [thumping] [screams] [thumping] JAMIE: [gasping] [sobbing] [scream] TINA: Don't hurt me. Please, don't hurt me. LIZ: Wait! Wait! Shh. TINA: They can hear us. They can hear us. It's all over the place. There and there. [hysterical laughing] They got Cal and Sarah. They took them to the well. They killed Sarah. They took them to the well. Fucking got Cal and Sarah. And they took them to the well! You're part of it now. Part of what? Stuff! That fungus stuff! JAMIE: [screaming] TINA: It's in your head. Shh.
