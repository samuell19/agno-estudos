I've been looking for someone. I will meet that person today Pawn (Incheon, 1993) Sergeant, over there. You ... are you sure it's there? Yes, I bet there. - How many times have you turned here? - I'll fix. Who would answer like that after being discharged from the military, damn it! Just say sorry - I'll fix. - Fix it again. Come here. You have skin allergies. Why are you wearing fake gold chains? Why? Follow me ... Come on ... Is there anyone here? Wow! Extraordinary. Why don't you get cola? Geez, it's okay. Take one. Chocolate Pie, damn it. Why don't you become a professional soldier? Forget it, eat it. Excuse me, we want to pay. There is no one. Did you go to the bathroom? Let's go. Sergeant, didn't you pay the bill? Hey kid, listen up. Everyone who borrows money has the same mentality. Aggressive, crazy, and wide-eyed. To raise capital. Are we deliberately eating free? Not. Is not it? Nobody took money? That's why people's hearts will change. It's like going into the room and going out the bathroom. The mood is different, right? Nobody takes the money, which fool will pay the bills and leave? So we're not stupid, are we, Sergeant? Sergeant, sergeant ... - I'll fix. - Fix? Sorry. Sorry. Come over here. Hey, isn't that him? - Oh , right? It seems so. What does that seem like? You wrote the agreement, damn it! You know that I don't recognize faces easily . Hey, you bastard. Iya, kan? Hi Myeong Shout like crazy every day. Hi Myeong Stop! Stop! - I'll pay it back - You ... I'll pay it back. Then why did you run? Playing with us? Sir, let me do it Excuse me, don't always make things difficult like this. Right? As long as you pay the interest on time, we won't be like this. I have a reason. What is the reason? Her father ... Died not long ago Oh, how come ... - His father ... - Hey, shut up, damn it. Shut up. Myeong-ja look at this. (Reminder Letter) Two months in arrears. Please give me some relief this month. - I'll pay three months, next month ... - What else? Three months. It's none of my business! Why not pay it back ... aaww. Hey! Little boy, look at me! See uncle's eyes clearly! My goodness ... You ... staring at an adult like that, ... ... the police will take you away. A rude little boy. Did you just hit me? Did you just hit people? No, I didn't do it on purpose. You're the one sticking out your head. Hey this uncle hit my mom! Please help my mom. - Hey ... hey ... - Sir, sir ... Hey, what do you see? Go away from here. Go! Jeez ... You give me a guarantee, to make me believe in you. I don't even have anything, how can I guarantee. Ah ... no money, no life, right? Okay... This is the guarantee. - Please spare me this time? - Mother - Wait a minute, hold on a second. - Bring the money until 4:00 tomorrow. I'll pay it back tomorrow. Hi Myeong I will take her and feed her and give her gifts. So don't worry, just bring the money. You shut up Hey, this is for you. Basic... I just bought you food and gave you a present. There is no such person in the world. But... Shit Uncle didn't try to do anything to you. If your mom brings the money. We will return you to your mother soon. So stop crying! Why is this little child crying for? What if the mother doesn't bring the money tomorrow? Damn it ... Which mother left her daughter for the damn 750,000? Will your mother do that to you? Why come again? I said don't come again. Please pay ... ... father of my son. Why don't you pay people who are already employed? I've said it several times. I already gave it. I didn't receive the money. It doesn't make any sense. A man who runs away with an affair, how is it possible to give money to his wife? How could it be? And also... Do you think I didn't know you were an illegal immigrant. I accept you, but I am treated like this. I have to pay interest today. It's your business. If you lend it to me ... ... I'll pay it back. Let go! Don't get in my way. Go. Watch out, watch out! I will do it. It's me Myeong-ja 750.000 There are so many people in this world, ... ... no one wants to lend me money. Didn't I tell you Surviving in this world is not that easy. I'll send you money. Just do what I say. This is all for the good of Seung-i. So don't worry. Thank you Uncle. Who are you calling again? Really. Your mom called me , I'll go call. Sir, I got the money. I'll bring the money at 9 in the morning. This is the first message Madame Myeong-ja Until tomorrow morning, I will take good care of the child. If you don't come tomorrow as promised, ... ... I'll send him to the orphanage.

You can sleep in this room. Wait a minute. Enter, enter, enter. Gosh, why don't you clean the room? Who opened it? You can't see it. Come here. Come in. Come in, go inside and sleep. Don't touch anything. Just go to sleep. Understand? Hey Jong-bae, prepare some wine and snacks. Isn't that a little too much? What? Catch that kid ... Who caught the kid? I just took it as collateral. What if he has no money and doesn't come tomorrow ?? Will definitely come tomorrow. He felt sorry for his daughter. What if he called the police. He can't call the police. His mother ... ... is an illegal immigrant. Right You're not this kind of person. - So kind, gentle and very human. - Right. Everything is good except the beating. Shit Loan sharks are truly awful Not loan sharks, but financial business. How many times have I said that? We are financial people working in the financial business Which financial person kidnapped a child? You bastard! Cheers How many times do you want me to say it? You have come. Are you guys crazy trying to crush me? Dare to kidnap a child ?! Not kidnapped but using him as collateral You know guarantees, right? Then, what about the money? The money has not been paid. Look what you have done idiots! What if he accuses you of kidnapping? The child's mother is an illegal immigrant she cannot report to the police Return to his mother! Then you write off the debt. You demanded us to collect the debt. President Choi, what's wrong with you? What is this? Is the contract only for show? Why write this? You two are not paid this month and next month. No, three months - You have to pay, right? - Do not be stingy. Who are we all doing this for? Bringing the child here as collateral? What's up with that? Do you want to be responsible for this debt? Again? If this continues, we ... It will be harder to survive. It is not like that? Then return the child to the mother and bring the money. Hurry out! - Jong-bae take the kid outside. - Good. Hey, let's go. So your mom left you. Take a look. He said he would bring the money at nine this morning. But he's not here after 12:00. So hurry and tell me where your house is. Only then can you and uncle meet your mother, right? You're so stubborn. Dammit. Sergeant, how about we turn? Hi Hi Hi. What are you doing? Go get him. Hey! Stop Hei Jong-bae Get over there Good Where it goes? - Gosh. Where can I find him? - Sergeant. Nothing, nothing. I can't find it Oh, my feet. My knee hurts. - Does it hurt? - Yes If you're sick, just die. Sergeant... Parents who lose their child must be very worried, right? What nonsense talk is that? Can't you give up this time? Think of it as helping the poor. Are you looking to die? So do we have to pay the money back? I don't know if you still have brains, man! What a heartless man. Son of a bitch. What did you just say? There is no. I didn't say anything Come over here quickly. Sergeant, wait for me. We've sent someone to look for it. - Anyway, find the kid and call me. - Good. Mother... Are we going to live here from now on? Oh... Although small ... ... be patient here Because something happened. How can this exist? Seung-i can learn to count on it! If my mom comes out when I'm not home Just write it here Is that why we have this? All right, let's do that. (Incheon Immigration Bureau) He said he had to see you But...

Uncle Seung-i will give you the money. He will take the child away. This is the number. You mean someone named Choi Byeong-dal ... ... will take the child away ... ... and pay me back? What if he doesn't take the child? It's not just losing money ... Shouldn't I take care of that kid too? A mother will never joke about her child. Too many women leave their children.

His name is Seung-i Call Seung-i, not a guarantee. 051? Shit. What is wrong? Message from Cha Cha Cha. Do you need money so fast? Do you have to do this? This. There's nothing else to sell What is this? Why did you sell our only asset. What should we do if the car is for sale? It's our fault that he was sold to the nightclub. Of course we have to be responsible to the end. We? What's wrong with me, I didn't do anything. You also went to Busan to bring him back. What does that have to do with it? What are you planning to do after you bring him back? Living together? That... Before sending him to a great place. - We'll take care of him for a while. - What? Besides, he had nowhere to go ... ... are you going to kick out a child like that? Clear your room. A completely heartless man. You should vacate the room, not me, dammit. (We'll get to work. Call you back in three seconds.) Are you sure this time? I told you it's true. The Missing Persons Association said ... ... age and name, they all match. And he is very sick now. But why the hospital ward? The hospital ward, means that it has withdrawn from treatment Halo Is there anything I can help? We received a call from this hospital. He said the person we were looking for was in this hospital. Good. What is his name? Park Doo-seok Is that Park Doo-seok? - Here - Is it there? Yes Please wait in the waiting room for a moment. I will take you there. - I'm so nervous. - I'm nervous too I'll get you to the ward right away. Good Grandfather... ... can you hear me? Can you open your eyes? Please come to confirm. Not.

Of course Operating costs 850,000 What do you plan to do if you can have surgery now. You say 850,000? Of 850,000. No, it's just a few stitches on the face. Is it that expensive? This is no ordinary operation. This is a special surgery that leaves no scars. I'm going crazy. I have asked the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Law. Lee Seung-i does not have Korean citizenship. So he can't go to school Even if someone like me doesn't learn anything, ... ... I know that too. But citizens of the Republic of Korea have an obligation to receive education. This is an obligation But isn't Seung-i Korean? He is not a Korean citizen. Ah yes ... Seung-i's grandfather Is a former member of the independence movement Go to China for that. And finally became a local Korean. The offspring of such a great man.

I said something will happen Don't you remember? Remember or not ... Ever since I brought that child back ... At least let him go to school. Do you want him to end up like us? So why do you do things that you can't afford to do? You're a tough guy, right? How dare you look at me and talk back! A man has brought the child, ... ... then you have to take responsibility to the end. Dammit. You heartless bastard. That's why it's like this. Why should I take responsibility. You did everything. Where do you want to go? Go buy cigarettes It's only a matter of time. Seung-i You should know ... Uncle Doo-seok is doing this so you can go to school. Things like citizenship registration ... Just a legal matter. It's nothing. You know we don't care about the law. That's why it's like this. What did you say? There is no. By the way, this shit ... Sorry. This country ... Doesn't admit that you are from this country. So just pretend ... Pretend to be a daughter. Not really being a girl So you studied hard. Meet your mother in the future. It is okay. How to tell mom?
