[upbeat rock music] [upbeat rock music] [engine revving] - Freeze, police! Don't move! [engine revving] Up against the car, you piece of shit! Spread 'em! [engine revving] Shit! [suspenseful music] [tires screeching] [engine revving] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [all shouting] [tires screeching] [dramatic synth music] - Son of a bitch! - Damn! - Don't drive! You're not coming back around here! [upbeat synth music] - God, are you all right? [grunting] - You just do what I tell you, you'll be okay. Now. Start backing off with me. Nice and slow. That's it, honey. That's it. [suspenseful music] You just stay right where you are, or I'll kill the little lady. Stop, you son of a bitch! You know fuckin' why you can't do a goddamn thing while I got her in front of me. So get lost, asshole! [grunting] [gun firing] [suspenseful music] - Oh my God. [sobbing] [car horn honking] - God damn it, Malone. Don't come tellin' me all you do was rid society of a rotten element. Are you aware of the goddamn mess that you caused? Not in the least, just as I fuckin' imagine. - Son of a bitch tried to kill me. What was I supposed to do? - You could have hit the girl. - But I didn't. So why are you so damn mad? - That's not the fuckin' point, Malone! - Okay. All right Boss, I'll change my ways. Happy now? - Like hell you will. Your goddamn service record's filled with your "I'll change my ways." Nobody's gonna fall for that shit anymore. - What the hell's that supposed to mean? I'll lose my vacation time? - This means you leave the goddamn country, Malone. Now shut that damn mouth of yours and listen. Our government and Interpol has organized an exchange program with different countries. Perfect chance for you to have a nice little vacation and maybe learn something. So you take this nice little trip and give me a break. - That's fine with me. I choose Paris. - You don't choose shit. You go where the hell I send you. - And where is that? May I ask? - Manila. - Manila? Philippines? - Yeah. That's where Manila is. - Bullshit. I'm not going to no Philippines. C'mon, Merden. It's too goddamn hot in the Philippines. Besides, I love Chicago. No way, no how am I going to the goddamn Philippines. - Welcome to the Philippines. - Passengers arriving on Pan American flight number 746 will be exiting through gate six. Please proceed to baggage claim area number three and have you baggage claim tickets ready for inspection. Thank you. [speaking foreign language] - You're American, aren't you? - Yeah, Chicago. - Well, I live here, and have been these 19 years. It's a beautiful country and the people are wonderful. But there are some bad elements I'd advise you to stay away from. They might present you with, shall we say unhappy pictures. - It's okay, pal. I'm used to unhappy pictures. - Well that's fine, and in that case, I'm sure you won't have any trouble whatsoever. My personal welcome to you, sir, have a pleasant stay. - Hey, lady, how about if I take these bags for you? - Hey, what are you doing? Stop that. Stop that! Get away from me. [man laughing] This isn't funny. - Maggie. Honey, wait. He stole my bag. [percussive music] Get after him but don't let the police see you. Go, move. [suspenseful music] [airplane engine roaring] - Wait! After them! Move! Go! [all chattering] Go out. Son of a bitch! Excuse me, excuse me. Wait! Stop that! Don't move. - Lieutenant Robert Malone 34th District Police in Chicago, am I right? - Yeah. - I'm Inspector Kevin McCall from Interpol. You've been assigned to me. - Is it always this hot in Manila? - Ah no, no, it's not. It's usually a lot hotter. - Where's my luggage? - Oh, it will be back in the hotel by now. - My gun? - That's in my office, which is where it's gonna stay. - Great. And in what hotel am I at? - You're in the Manila Gardens Hotel, okay? Get in. - Manila Gardens. What else? [upbeat music] - I've read your police report, it's very impressive. - Cut the bullshit, McCall, we both know why I'm here. - Let me tell you something, Malone. Here it's not like back home. Our agents do not use firearms unless it's absolutely necessary. - That's fine, as long as nobody is shooting at me. - Malone, I'm trying to tell you- - Hey, c'mon, all right. No speeches. If I wanna know something, I'll ask. That way, we might wind up being friends. - Yeah, that's real good prospect. - Anyway, a prospect. [upbeat music] - Good afternoon, Inspector. - Good afternoon, Frank. This is our new guest, Mr. Malone. Take good care of him. - You could be sure. Please follow me, Mr. Malone. - Look, go. I'd like my gun back tomorrow. - Yeah, well we'll discuss that in the morning, Malone. I don't want any of your fireworks in this town. - My wallet? - That we will try to get back to you. I expect you in my office first thing. I'll send a car for you, nine o'clock. - Fine. - Oh, Malone, welcome to the Philippines. - Yeah. - Any luck yet? - No. - Sure you remember his face? - It's imprinted here in my brain. That's him. - Eddie Mallory? You fell for Eddie the Colonel? - If you'd described him to me, I could have saved you a lot of time. - You know this clown? - Yeah, sure I know him, everybody knows him. He's one of the pathetic characters in Manila. He's a small-time pickpocket con artist. He use to pass himself off as a retired English army colonel. - Used to? - Oh yeah. Years ago. I mean, nobody's fool enough to fall for that anymore, but the nickname remains. - Where can I find him? - Why don't we try where he lives? [all chattering] Excuse me, ma'am. - What the hell do you want? Can't you see I'm busy? - Police. - So what? - Does Eddie Mallory live here? - Upstairs, apartment 607. - Thank you ma'am. - I knew that man will get into trouble. [doorbell ringing] - Open up, Carl, it's the police. [knocking on door] [suspenseful music] - One shot through the temple, instant death. Possibly .38. Dead, not more than a couple of hours. - It could have been a mistake, too. He's too small time for this. - Maybe he lifted one wallet too many. - No, there's got to be more to it than that. - Holy shit. [laughing] Look what I found, my wallet. - Is everything in it? - Everything, including the money. [woman screaming] - Hey, take it easy. Look at me. - But he's dead. I know it. Sooner or later - Did you see anything? Did you hear a gunshot? - No. - Did you know that the Colonel had a daughter? - No. - Well, there's a Peggy Mallory out there somewhere. - Yeah, the question is where? - I know where you can find her. - Where? - What's in it for me? - Society's gratitude, ma'am. - You know what I can do with that. - All right, all right. Will this do? - You ain't very generous, are you? - If you don't want it, give it back. She works at the, ah, Tropicana Club. - Okay, where is there a phone? - Downstairs, it's payphone. - Good, go, go. Alis, alis. You call Tropicana, get this girl's address. I'll come down and join you in a minute. - All right. - This must be the place. [doorbell ringing] - Can I help you? - Yes, are you Miss Peggy Mallory? - I certainly am. - I'm Detective McCall. This is Detective Malone. Could we come in, please? - Sure. Sit down. All right, what has my father been up to this time? - Well, we're not actually here because of anything he's been up to. - I find that hard to believe. - I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but your father's dead. - I always knew that one day someone would come through that door and tell me something like that. And now that it's happened, it seems incredible. How did he die? - Someone shot him. - What? My father never hurt anyone. Everything went wrong for him. He wanted to give me the moon. He used to say that someday a good deal would come his way, and I'd be the richest and most envied girl in Manila. He used to repeat it every night in place of the fairy tales my mother never lived long enough to tell me. I found work and I managed to support myself, but he never gave up his dreams, until now. - When was the last time you saw him? - Three weeks, maybe a month. I couldn't stand his stories anymore. And now? I don't know what I'd give to be able to hear them again. Well, if you came hoping I could help you with your investigation, sorry to disappoint you. - It doesn't matter. Thank you. - Thank you, Ms. Mallory, and our condolences. [dramatic music] - Well, what do you think? - I don't know. But I do know one thing. You don't kill somebody unless you've got a good reason, and Eddie Mallory was just a nickle and dimer. Unless- - Unless he fell into something he didn't know about. - Yeah. Could be. Who knows? Well, come on. Let's go. - Where are we going now? - I can't put it off any longer. You're coming to dinner at my house. Meet the rest of the McCalls. - Fine. Hope they're not all like you. - You're a riot, Malone. [upbeat funk music] - You'll never catch me now. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll see, we'll see. Got two more laps to go. All right, all right. Gonna catch you now. - You won, didn't you buddy! You got him! You got him! - I knew I would! - Kid's got a lot more gall than you. And he's a whole lot nicer. - You got that right. He's a great kid. Great kid! Yeah, he got all of his good traits from Mary. All he picked up from me was how to be stubborn. Right? - Bobby. You've been up much later than usual this evening. Don't forget, you've got school at eight o'clock in the morning. - Awwww. - Time for bed, young man. - Come on. Let's go. - Good night, Bobby. - Good night, Mr. Malone. - The kid doesn't even let me win one damn game. [laughing] You know, it's been a long time since I did something like that. - Yeah, well, games are great. I mean, Bobby and I play whenever we get the chance. - My compliments to your son. He's a fine kid. - Oh, Kevin would give his right arm for him. I count much less. - Oh, come on, Mary. What are you saying? - The truth. - Hey, hey. I gotta go. It's been a fine evening. - Yeah, well hey, I'll bring you back. - No, no no. Don't bother. I need the exercise. I'll see myself out. - Bye. - Suit yourself, Malone. All right. See you in the morning. - Bye bye. - He seems nice. - Yeah, he's all right. - Good evening, Frank. - Good evening, Mr. Malone. - Can you tell me where the Tropicana Club is? - Uh, well, not too far away. Three blocks and to the right. - Thank you, pal. [upbeat music] - Can I help, sir? - Yeah, I'm looking for a Miss Mallory. I understand she works here. - There she is now.

That was a very fine tune. - Thanks. I've been meaning to call you. Just after you left, I received a letter sent by my father. - A letter? - It had a baggage receipt in it. - Have you checked it out yet? - Yes, I did. But can we talk about this somewhere else? My car is right outside. - Fine with me. - It'll just take me a minute to change. - Okay. You make weak drinks, man. - That's what it was. A bag with $10,000 in it. - May I? - Of course. I can't tell you what a strange feeling it was, getting a letter from him after his death like that. - Well, it appears that your father loved you quite a bit. - I just don't understand where he could've gotten so much money. He wasn't into robbing banks. - We'll find out. In the meantime, I think you should give that money to Lt. McCall to keep for ya. It's a little dangerous for you to have. - Whatever you think best. I trust you. - Oh yeah? Thank you. - Would you like a lift back to the hotel? - Yeah, that's fine. - Bob? May I ask you something? - Sure, why not? - What brings you to Manila? - Well, on the pretext, learning the methods used by Interpol. - And the real reason? - Ha ha, well, they think I'm too violent. - Well, I think you're just the opposite. - Well, appearances can be deceiving. - Should I be worried? - If I were you, I would be. We've got company. [suspenseful music] [gun firing] [speaking foreign language] - Don't shoot. I want them alive. Get them. [suspenseful music] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] [groaning] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] The police, look out! [speaking foreign language] - Get after them! Move, you guys! - All right, let's go! - Get their asses! - You all right? How about the girl? - She'll be okay. - What the hell happened here? - Four men in a black Datsun tried to kill us. - Have a report on my desk in the morning. - McCall, how in the hell did you get here so fast? - We've been following you all night, Malone. Your doorman at the hotel is an ex-cop. - Hey. Next time, make it quicker. - So sorry. - What should I have done? Called a cop? - It's not of your goddamn business, Malone. You're a guest here. You've got no right to start your own investigation. - Investigation? All I did was go to a goddamn nightclub. How did I know all hell was going to break loose? - From past experience, I would have thought, according to your records, you always manage to screw things up. - Get off my back, McCall. I may be a guest in this country, but I'm still a cop. - That's right, you are. So am I. So let's start thinking like cops. Now the fact remains that somebody tried to kill you or the girl, and it's our job to find out why. [knocking on door] Come in. - The Datsun's owned by the Basra Oil Company. They have a branch here at the port and a couple of oil tankers. The manager's name is Asad Caburi. - Okay. Let's go pay Asad Caburi a visit. Are you coming, Malone? Yes or no? - Are you sure it's wise for me to come along? I mean the goddamn port might blow up or something. [boat horn blowing] [boat horn blowing] - Our mechanic here had reported that the Datsun had been stolen two days ago. We waited to report it to the police, hoping it would turn up. You see, this sort of thing has happened before, and it always ends up with a fine to one of our workers who had borrowed the car. Fortunately, this time, our investigation confirms our suspicion of a real theft. Inspector, may I ask why you are so interested in this case? You didn't actually find the car, did you? - Oh, no, this is just a routine investigation. But you see, the man in that car tried to kill a police officer. He used a machine gun. - Oh, terrible. Mustapha, go. If there is anything I can do for you, please consider me at your disposal. I will show you the door. - That clown didn't convince me. I think he's full of bullshit. - Oh, he's lying for sure. But all we've got is supposition. I mean, that's not enough to accuse him of attempted murder. - People shooting at me is a lot more than supposition. I tell you, that girl's life is in danger. - And let me guess, you'd like to be assigned the case, right? Give you a chance to shoot off some fireworks? - The fireworks have already started, partner. I'm just a little concerned about her, that's all. - Me too. That's why I've got men assigned to guard her house 24 hours a day. Jesus, Malone. You don't have a very high opinion of our agents, do you? [suspenseful music] - Hello? They were just here. Yes, of course I did. I don't think they fell for it. I don't know how much the girl knows. But, she has the bag and she's in contact with the American. We can't take any risks. All right. Goodbye. [upbeat music] [laughing] [audience applauding] - I never grow tired of shows like this. Do you like it? - You're fine. - You've been silent all evening. Am I that much of a bore? - No, no. On the contrary. - Then what's wrong? - I'm a little concerned about you, Peggy. - What do you mean? - I've been trying to put the pieces together. You know, those men were not out to kill me. They were after you. - Why me? - For something they think you know or have. - Like what? - Are you sure you've told me everything? Was that baggage receipt the only thing your father sent to you in that envelope? - Of course. What else should there have been? Bob, you have to believe me. I don't know what's happening, and I'm afraid, more so now than ever. I thought I could count on your help. But when you look at me that way, I know I'm alone. - You're right. I'm sorry. I was only, uh, hoping you'd told me everything. I tell you what. Let's forget everything I said. Let's start over, okay? And the best way to do that is with a nice, cold bottle of champagne. [percussive music] [shouting] [percussive music] [audience applauding] [upbeat music] - Would you like to try? - No, thanks. - Come and do a dance with us. - Uh-huh. - Will you come up? It will be fun. - Say yes. - You're not afraid of a broken ankle or two, are you? - Don't worry, they have an ambulance on call. [audience applauding] [upbeat music] [all cheering] - You're a pretty good bamboo dancer. - So are you. It was a marvelous evening. Thanks for cheering me up. - My pleasure. - Would you like to come in for a nightcap? - Why not? [light piano music] - Bob. - Stay alert, pal. [gun firing] [grunting] [muffled grunting] - Take her away. Get her to tell you where the bag is. You know how to make her talk. - Promised, asshole. Promised. - I know. It was an accident. They do happen. - An accident. A policeman is killed, a girl is kidnapped, and all you can say is that it was an accident. - Look, back off, will you? I mean shooting your mouth off about this is not going to make her come back. It's not going to make anything easier. - Yeah, you're right, you're right. Getting my hands around Caburi's throat sure would make me feel a hell of a lot better. Peggy told me about the bag she received from her father with 10 grand in it. Maybe he stole it from Caburi. Maybe Caburi kidnapped her. Anyway, he damn sure knows where she is. - That may be, but using violence is not going to get it out of him. I mean, the best we can do is file a complaint with the Iranian embassy if we had the proof, which we don't. - What are we supposed to do, stand here, wait for a miracle? - No, no, we can move it along. I'm on my way to visit Caburi right now. - Not without me, you're not. - Only on my terms, Malone. I want your word that we'll play this my way. - Fine. For now. - Maria, take all my calls for me. I'll be back soon. - Yes, sir. [boat horn blowing] [suspenseful music] - I don't think there's anyb- [suspenseful music] Shit. Malone! [grunting] - Where did they take the girl? - What girl? I don't know what you are talking about! - Let me refresh your memory! - Don't, don't, don't. I told you, I don't know what you are talking about! [grunting] [suspenseful music] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] No, don't. - Tell me or I'll kick your ass all over this place! [grunting] - No more, please! [grunting] - Malone, you stop it right now! You hold it right there. - You saw what happened! He's crazy! He almost killed me! - Shut the fuck up! You slipped on some oil and banged your face, that's what happened to you. - All right, Malone, outside, now. - You won't get away with this! You are not police! You are goons! - The hell you let him go for? He would have talked. - Look, you were way out of line in there, Malone. I told you, we don't use those kinds of tactics here. Now, get in the car. - McCall, I'm not here to be ordered around by you. - Would you please get in the car? [phone ringing] - Hello, who is it? - It's Mustapha from the garage. - What the hell do you want? I told you never to call me at home. - Two were just here. That pig of an American broke a couple of my ribs. He wanted to know about the girl. - And what did you tell him? - Nothing, boss. You know you can trust me. There's nothing to fear. They're groping in the dark. The plans and the microfilm are safe. - Maybe. To be safe, call Kamen at the warehouse. Anticipate departure a couple of hours. Got it? - Yes, sir. A couple of hours. - While you were playing tough guy, I bugged the phone. It's a lot less dramatic but a little more effective. - So what the hell did you find out? - Proof that Caburi was involved in kidnapping Peggy Mallory. - Which doesn't bring us any closer to knowing where the girl is. - I'm not so sure about that. [tape rewinding] - Maybe. To be safe, call Kamen at the warehouse. Anticipate departure a couple of hours. Got it? [suspenseful music] - What kind of departure do you think Caburi is talking about? - How in the hell am I supposed to know? A car, a plane, ship. - Yeah, a ship. A ship, yeah. That's it. Basra Oil company has got two oil tankers in the dock right now. Now, if one of them is leaving today, that would be it. Yeah, get me the harbormaster, absolute priority. - Harbormaster. - Captain, this is Inspector McCall here, from Interpol. Can you tell me, do you have any Basra Oil Company ships leaving today? - Hold on, I'll check it out. Yes, here it is. The Mr. El Guam. It's scheduled to leave in two hours. - Thank you very much. We'll meet you at the wharf. Hold that ship. Don't let it go anywhere. Let's go. [gun firing] [suspenseful music] - The fuck is that? [gun firing] - Cover me. [guns firing] [suspenseful music] [gun firing] [gun firing] - You okay? - Yeah, yeah I'm okay. It's just a scratch. How are you? - I'll survive. - Hey, Malone. Thanks. You saved my life. - I didn't want your wife to get mad at me. - Let's go find that ship. [suspenseful music] [engine revving] - Damn it! Shit. - Hey, McCall, do you think I could have my- - You bet. - Well, all we can do now is wait for the Coast Guard. - Let me go! Where are you taking me? - Hey, hold it! Police! [suspenseful music] [guns firing] [guns firing] [screaming] [sobbing] - Now we do it my way. - Where are you taking me? [screaming] - We'll set the trap for them. You go that way, you double back behind the warehouse and then come around the front. Move! [suspenseful rock music] - Bob! [gun firing] [grunting] Someone help me! - Double back and get those two! - Yeah man, let's go. - C'mon, let's go! [heavy rock music] [gun firing] [gun firing] [guns firing] [man groaning] [guns firing] [explosion booming] [heavy rock music] [gun firing] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] [upbeat music] [grunting] [grunting] - Beg for your life like the girl did. - Please. Please. [gun firing] [gun firing] [grunting] [gun firing] [grunting] - McCall. [gun firing] [grunting] [grunting] [water splashing] - Hey Cortez, we have wounded men down here, call the ambulance. Listen, John, I want all Basra employees taken in for questioning, you got it? Look, I want a warrant made out for the arrest of Asad Caburi. Look, I want all Basra ships and offices requisitioned. Now! Move! Back to the warehouse, see if we can find that black bag. - Jesus. There was enough ammo here to blow up half of the city. - And here's the bag. Well, well, well, what do you know. Just big enough for some microfilm. [siren blaring] Oh man, why don't you go on home and get some rest? Doctor said that guy is not gonna able to talk before morning anyway. - He's the only witness we've got. I'll wait it out here. - By the way, we closed up the Basra Oil Company offices. - Caburi? What about him? - He has vanished, he has just disappeared. - Where are you going? - Can't take it anymore, going to the hospital. - Hold on, I'm coming too. [suspenseful music] - I'm sorry, Doctor, no one is allowed to go in without authorization. - Ah, of course, how stupid of me. - Don't move! Don't even breathe. - You're too late. - What time is it? [grunting] - Few minutes before nine. - Oh, man. My, my, my, how time flies. - Not for Caburi. He's stalling for something. - Yeah, well he's gotta have some reason for killing so many people. - That's for sure. All we have to do is find a way to get it out. - God. Mary. - What's Mary got to do with this? - I forgot to call her last night. - Doesn't she call you here? - No, she knows not to bother me at work. Hello darling, look, I'm sorry, I've been here all night long. Is everything okay? - Everything is fine. - Good. How's my boy? - I just took him to school. He said to give you a special hug. - Great. I'll be home soon as I can. Bye bye. - Honey. - Yes? - Don't tire yourself too much. - Don't worry about me. Bye, sweetheart. - Bye bye. - Oh women, they're all alike. - You think so, huh? Not the circles I travel in. - Chief? - Yeah, what is it? - The prisoner wants to see you. [suspenseful music] - Okay Caburi, we're listening. What have you got to tell us? - My watch says nine o' clock. How about yours? - Do you think you're funny? You think this is a fucking joke? - No, it's serious. Dead serious, Inspector. Turn on the television. Look at the news. - A message from the Pan-Islamic Liberation Front asks the immediate release of Ahmed Komi, the charismatic leader of Al Fasai arrested some weeks ago at the Manila airport. At the same time, a command of guerrillas has taken over the Institute, barricading themselves in on the fifth floor. Along with the release of Ahmed Komi, the PLF has asked for the release of 12 other political prisoners & a fully fueled- - That's my son! You've got my son! You shit! You fucking got my son! They got my son! - Calm down, calm down. Calm down McCall, calm down. He's playing us, he's playing us. - But any attempt to penetrate the building by force will result in complete disaster. - Any orders, sir? - Yeah. Surround them. Coordinate the operations with the Chief of Police and the Armed Forces. This is a wait-and-see situation, I want no shooting without my permission, is that clear? - Yes, sir. Very clear. - So, Caburi, what is so fucking important about that microfilm that it's worth all these people's lives? - The list of our future actions. - There aren't going to be any future actions for you, pal. You're history. And so are your scumbag friends who uses little kids as their shields. Get this asshole out of my sight. - I advise you to come to terms with my compatriots. They're men capable of anything, and they won't hesitate to blow up the place along with your son. - Stay where you are! Move back. He's mine. Don't move! Hold it, Caburi, right there! [suspenseful music] [grunting] [gun firing] [gun firing] [grunting] - Clean up this mess. - Hello, Mary. - What the hell are they waiting for, why don't they bring the prisoners? There are 350 kids there, do they realize that or not? - Take it easy, McCall, the government has already agreed to the exchange it's only a matter of minutes now. - Yeah, but then why aren't they here? - You relax, that's them. - Tell Brennan I need to talk to him right away. - I'm right here, Charlie, what is it? - Where the hell is Ahmed Komi? What about Komi? - Come here, Brennan. I've got news for you. A misfortune, a tremendous misfortune. Ahmed Komi committed suicide in his cell 15 minutes ago. We were holding him under pressure for him to withdraw his men and then he killed himself. - That puts us in a hell of a position, now what? - I really don't know, I don't know. We have to play for time. Above all, don't let this news leak out, or else, we lose all our hopes. - What are we supposed to do now, huh? What are we supposed to tell them? - Listen, McCall. Words don't mean spit. We gotta go into action. Get someone to bring the building engineer and a floor plan to this place. - And do what? - We need some clothes and some equipment. Go. - Yes, sir. - Okay, what do you have got in mind? - Surprise is the only weapon we've got. We've got to get inside the building. - Yeah, but how do we get up there? - Elevator shaft. You stop at the fifth floor. I'll come in from the roof. - That won't work, see, 'cause the windows are mined. - Frames are, not the glass. - Yeah, but, how are you gonna get to the window? - That's my business. Once inside the building, you take care of the hallway. I'll handle the rest. We've got to move into action before they hear about Kumi's death. Right? - Right. - The decision of the Government to come to terms with the terrorists has met with unanimous consent of the entire country.

I love you so much. - I love you too. - Baby, I'm gonna get our little boy. I swear to God, I am. - At this moment, 75 countries in contact via satellite are watching with anxious hearts. - Ready? - Yeah. [suspenseful music] - Great. I'll go ahead.
