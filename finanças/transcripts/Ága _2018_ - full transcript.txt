Your boots are soaking wet. The weather's warmer now. These past few years, spring has been coming earlier. It's normal. I haven't caught anything for four days. It's not the first time. Really? I can't remember. I'm going to check the snares tomorrow. But you checked them yesterday! Did I? You're getting old. That's why you can't remember. The ointment helps me a lot. My mother taught me how to make it. Your mother was a good woman. I remember one of her sisters. Her eyes had no colour. Her family was the first to move to the city. Moha. That was her name. When she was a child, people would mistake her for a boy. Has Chena brought you any news of Moha? I don't think so. If he comes here, ask him, please. He'll come. Chena's a good boy. He likes change. Put some of the ointment on the other leg too. Legs are like members of a family. One can't do without the other. The ravens are here again. That may not be a bad sign. - Are they far from here? - Not very far. Don't move. Are you going behind the rocks soon? I want to come with you. There are three rocks there that look like parents with their child. I love those stone figures, because they'll last forever. Go ! Go ! I saw reindeer tracks, today. Near the hills. I believe I saw the reindeer as well. It was far off. It was standing there, looking at me. When we were children, we had this strange reindeer in the herd. I even gave him a name. I can't remember it today. He used to stare at me all the time, whatever the others were doing. My father thought I was afraid of that reindeer and he got rid of him. I cried a lot after that. That was the last time I ever cried. It's been a while since the reindeer stopped coming here. It was alone. It was real. I could smell it. Was it a male reindeer? How did you smell it at distance? Ága used to love your reindeer stories. Sing for me, please. Give me that. Give it here. Leave it. One, two, three. Monday, Tuesday, Friday. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Did your trip take long, Chena? No. No longer than usual. I bought you some firewood and some kerosene. For the lamp. I saw Ága. She had a request. She asked me to give this to you. When did you see her? Recently. How is she? She's working at the diamond mine. I she alone, now? I don't know. Are you going there again? I don't know. It's not up to me. Let me show you something. Here's a photo. We took it when Ága was still a child. She wore a pretty hat. But it's hard to see it in the photo. Look how happy she was, back then. I'm making her the exact same hat again. Ága will be thrilled. Nanook must have forgiven her now. He also wants to see Ága. I'm sure he does. Once I finish the hat, Nanook and I will find Ága and give it to her. Ága shouldn't have done what she did. When Ága and I were children, we used to love your magical stories. Once upon a time, a great hunter who lived in our lands. He knew every nook and cranny. One year, the animals started to disappear. The hunter would go out every day, but always came back empty-handed. One morning, he went out when a reindeer appeared in front of him. The reindeer ran and the hunter started chasing it. The reindeer reached a rocky hill and hid. The hunter crept up, ready to kill it, when the reindeer shone with a bright light and spoke in a human voice: "I'm the magical reindeer", it said. "Spare me and I'll give you all the riches in the world." The reindeer beat it hooves on the ground and diamonds and gold started pouring from the earth. Then, the hunter said: "I don't need precious stones." I'm a hunter." "What I need, are animals to hunt." The reindeer said: "I will grant your wish." The reindeer beat the ground again and snowflakes started to fall. Each snowflake turned into an animal. A weasel, a bear, a wolf, a moose. Then, all those animals scattered. And that's how, our lands became so rich with animals. I brought you tobacco. Do you go to the city, sometimes? Are you still drinking? No. I had them made in the city. I made you some gloves. Thank you. Will you be coming back? Yes. Is that diamond mine far from here? It's a long way. Hold it still. Hold it. Hold it. Cut this here. - Where? - Here. Cut it like that. There's a strong wind coming. Do you remember when there was that huge storm and our yurt almost collapsed? We lost two of our reindeeer in that storm. I remember, yes. Times were good, when we had reindeer. Ága loved to feed them, by hand. Sedna, take this. Hurry! Sedna! Get the furs inside! Get everything inside. Hurry up! Pull it! Hurry! Tie it firmly! Pull the rope! Grab the rope! It's going to collapse. Pull it harder. Pull it! Pull it harder. I had a dream yesterday. In the dream, I'm a young girl. I'm walking across the open tundra. While I'm walking, I see a naked baby playing on the ice. A baby boy, holding falcon feathers. He's laughing, playing, having fun. I think he's going to get cold, so I pick him up and bring him home. We go home and play for a long time. Then I get tired and fall asleep. When I wake up, I see the boy has turned into a big polar bear. He lifts me up. His fur gets in my eyes and I can't see anything. He takes me away, far from home. He takes me to his home, but I tell him: "No, I'm not coming." Then suddenly, the polar bear turns into a young man. He takes me inside his home. It appears that his home turns out to be a hole in the ground. We go down, deeper and deeper into the hole. It's wonderful! All the stars from the sky have fallen down there. There's not a single star left in the sky. They're glowing with a bright light, shining brilliantly. Everything's so bright that I go blind. I forget everything. I forget who I am, where I've been, where I come from, who I used to be, before. I forget everything. And the I woke up. Chena met with Ága. He knows where she is. Let's go see her together. I'm making a hat for her. Ága's our child, after all. We should forgive her. They say music travels through the air, like the wind. I wonder what that music's about. There must be meaning behind everything. It sounds like the person who made this music has suffered a lot. That's why it's so heavy for the soul. In this world, people talk, people sleep and people eat. But what is really important is to keep the family together. Whatever happens. A few years ago, I had a wife from Canada. She was two meters tall. She came here to learn our language. And I turned out to be a great teacher. But then, she had to leave. She went back home. I wonder if she thinks about me sometimes. - Hello. - Hello. Papers for the timber? - Are you over 20 tonnes? - 19. Really? It's written there. See for yourself. Who's this man? Where's he going? A reindeer herder. I picked him up. Where's he going? To the mine. His daughter works there. - Do you have an ice drill? - Yes. Ice has been thin in recent years. Check its thickness every 30 km. Stay in radio contact. - Do you have enough fuel? - Yes. Fine. Go ahead! Once, I met the devil hitch-hiking. Picked him up around here. He had large hands and large feet. When he came in, it got very cold. I'm a Christian. I believe in God. If there's no God, there's no devil either. If God created everything, He must have created the devil too. That's what the priest said. What about you? Do you believe in God? Is it alive? I don't know. I think it's dead. I tied it up well. Nothing like this has happened before. Reindeer are stupid animals. What was it doing on the road? Maybe it thought it was invisible. My wife had a dream before she died. She dreamed of a polar bear taking her somewhere. While they're walking, the bear turns into a young man. "Come to my house", he says. My wife refuses. So he says: "I've been looking for you my whole life", and takes my wife to his home. In fact, his home turns out to be a hole in the ground. All the stars from the sky have fallen into the bottom of the hole, and his home is glowing with their light. When my wife goes into the hole, she loses consciousness. And then she forgets everything from the outside world. That was a dream. You should go that way. When you get over the mountain, you'll find the diamond mine. Subtitles: mos3n
