[New Children's Orchestra] Hello, Totzsa. It's ready - Hi. Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi. They are convex polyhedron... as all their faces are regular polygons identical to each other. - Come on. - Once we know this, we can work out the convex angle... of a circumference. - Go on, frog eater. - What's going on? I'll rub it out if you've finished. - No! - Go and call for your Dad. - He isn't here. - He isn't here or he doesn't want to come out? - He isn't here, he's not back from work. - What time can I find him? - I don't know. - Listen carefully so you don't forget any of it. Tell him I came round on behalf of Batata. Batata says he needs to see him urgently. - What else? - Nothing else, kid. Don't get big-headed. Are you going to remember or will I have to come back? - I'll remember. - You're going to remember. Tell him to go today, even if it's late. - And he said to me, is he here or not? I said to him, he isn't here. He asked me what time can I find him? And I told him, I don't know. - What else? - He said that he came on behalf of Batata... and for me not to forget to tell you... and not to get big-headed. He turned his bike on and left. - Look what they gave me. - Eat up. -We have to go to Junín on Saturday. They're going to form a children's orchestra... in the Municipal Theatre. I have to try out. - Why? - So they can see how I play. - No, I mean why do you want to try out? Are you going to go to Junín every day? - Well, twice a week if they pick me. - Do you think you're going to travel twice a week to Junín? - Maybe, because there aren't many who play my instrument. - Alright, but it doesn't seem like a good idea to me. I'm being honest with you. - We'll see. - We'll see. - Hello. - Hi. - Bye, Carlos. - Thanks. - Bye, Totzsa. - Come on, little one. - Who can tell me... what happened on the 12th of March, the Town Day? Anyone? - We're going to the bridge tomorrow. Choco and Favi said they would. - Shall we go? Let's go by bike, I'll get one for you from by brother. - I can't if it's in the morning. - Well, it sounds like Delfín has something to tell all of us. - What's up, man? What are you doing round here? I don't like you coming round here. When I have the money, I'll take it to you. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - I should tell him that? - Yeah, tell him that if you want. Or tell him that I was laying the road... but they stopped everything and left us high and dry. Now I'm on a building site... but I have to get settled. - You know what? I already know what Batata will say to me. He'll say, what the hell do I care? I'll have to come back again to say the same thing. So let's save a trip and tell me what to say to him. - What does that guy want? - Nothing, he's nobody. - Who's Batata? - Don't you worry. We're not going to get worked up over a couple of idiots. They don't know who they're messing with, do they? - Tomorrow... I'm going to play in the ceremony. You can come if you want. - On Saturday 17th March, Carlos Nakata, the maestro... invites you to the Junín Municipal Theatre. Come and take part in the auditions... to join the children's orchestra. Find out about the terms at www... Let's go. - I need to ask you for a favour. - Let's see. - I want to go to Junín on Saturday. They're going to set up trials for an orchestra. Excellent. That's great. I'd heard about that. But you don't need to take anything, they'll have all the instruments there. What? - It's not the same. - Yes, but it's difficult what you're asking of me. This instrument is one hundred years old. It's a relic. Imagine if something happened to it. - But it's to play music... and I'm the only in the town who knows how to play it. - Right, and we look after it so it's always here for you to play. But not so you can take it on a 30 mile trip. Who are you going with? - With my Dad. - Alright. - This is what we'll do... Tell your Dad to write a note requesting it, blah blah blah... to sign it and leave it in the office, alright? And if they decide to lend it to you... treat it as if it's made out of gold. Alright? Don't mention me in the note. Let's go. From a corner of the fatherland A glow rises in the sky Fruitful cry from the soul Vitality that is channeled in voice. Pearl of the prairie Cradle and marble, your son am I Always in my heart, indelible Loyal splendour. - Hello. How are you? Fine. Everything's really good here. No, no, it's not necessary. Come on, please, we've already talked about it. No, don't make it harder for me, please. No, I don't want you to come. Don't worry, I'm fine, really. It's small, but it's pretty. Well, fulfill your part. Don't call me. Alright? - Did it bite? Did it bite? - Pull it. Go on. Go on. Look at it. It bit. It bit. - Go on! Well done. Pull it. Ready... Go. - Come on. Come on, froggie. You can do it. Mine is winning. - No, mine is winning. Come on. Yeah! - Hi, Mum. I'm at Delfín's. He hasn't been to school for three days... so I'm leaving his homework. I'll be back pretty late because he's a real donkey. - Hey! - Frog legs! I'll serve. So hungry. - On Saturday we're going to Junín. - Who? - Both of us. For the orchestra trials. You have to sign a letter for me. Still insisting? - We agreed. - We agreed? - Whether you want to or not... we're going because you promised. - I promised? I didn't promise anything. It's alright. I'll try and make it possible. - Do you promise? - Give it a break. I said I'll try and make it possible. But give it a break. Who do you think I am? What's that letter for me to sign? Valdez! - It's Batata's collector. - Leave it. Delicious. - Which ones? - The hearts. - I've spoken to your Dad about the advance. - Yes, yes. The clovers. - If I have to argue again, that's it, I cut your loose. - Alright, alright. And the biscuits with jam. There we go. I'll note this down and take it off at the end of the month. - Alright, fine. - So that's sixty pesos. - Alright. Bye, Totzsa. It's for Friday. - Alright. - When are you going to read it? - Come on, treasure. Come on, little one. Get back to the classroom. - There are twenty minutes left... until I collect all the exams. - Give me a pastry, frog eater. - They're for someone else. - For someone? Are you trying to be mysterious? Do you want to come and play... on the playstation at home on Saturday? - I can't on Saturday. - Why can't you? - I have to go to Junín. - To Junín? What are you going to Junín for? - What do you care? - What's up, Delfi? Everything alright? Are we going to the party? Don't be stroppy. You know what... They're going to give me an advance of the money on Friday. We'll be able to travel peacefully. What's this? - Dad. - What? - Why did you call me Delfín? - I've told you, I don't know. - Go on. - It was your mum's idea. She read somewhere that dolphins show lost sailors the way home. - What's that got to do with anything? - What do I know? It was your mum. And I liked it. Do you know what a dolphin's home is? - No. - The whole sea. That's what your mum used to say. - Shall we go? Come on, let's go. Grumpy guts. - Attention, folks! Great outdoor village dance Fun and dancing for everyone tonight. - That's you. That chubby one's your mum. - Bye, girl. - On Saturday we're going to Junín. - Sleep. - We have 2, helium... 10, neon... 18, argon... and 36, krypton. And next we have... the alkaline metals. 3, lithium... 11, sodium... 19, potassium. - Do you have an answer for me? - About what? - About the letter. - What letter? - The letter I handed in to borrow the horn. I've not got anything. What did the letter say? - The teacher Mr. Sosa told me to write a letter to borrow the instrument. - Which instrument? The horn. The one in the glass cabinet. - Nobody said anything to me. - It doesn't matter. He didn't say anything other than to bring the letter. - Did you bring it? - Yes. - Alright, then stay calm, if that's what Sosa told you. - Where's your dad, kid? He's never at home. - If you want, you can look for him at the building site. - Where is it? - I don't know. Listen to me. First of all, don't pretend to be cool. Secondly, tell him that Batata said it's too late, he's fed up. He's cheesed off. Tell him that he's going to bring some papers... for him to sign over the land. It's all set in motion. Are you going to remember? Tell him he's fed up at being played for a fool. Tell him that. - Sosa doesn't come in on Fridays. What do you need? - Don't you remember? I brought the letter. - Yes, what was it for? - To borrow the horn. - But Sosa isn't here. And he's the one who has the key for the cabinet. - So? What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in class? What's going on? - I need to ask you something. - What? - Money. - No, stop the car. You didn't turn up twice, you asked for an advance, you took pastries. Now what you do you want money for? - Tomorrow I'm going to Junín. I'm doing an audition for an orchestra. - Are you going alone? - No, with my dad. But if they don't pay him, he's going to say we can't go. - And you'd like to go? - It's really important to me. - No, no. I don't want trouble. I know how it'll end up. Your dad will come and I'll end up arguing with him. No, forget about it. - There's somebody, Totzsa. - Tell your Dad to come and talk to me. That way I'll give you money, it's not a problem. But not like this as he'd come to the bakery to argue... I'm tired of that now. -Good morning. - Good morning. - What will you be having? - Bye, Totzsa. - Bye, Delfín. - Afternoon. - Hi. How much do you need? - I'd like to be paid for my extra hours. - No, extra hours are paid all together at the end. - I'd avoid spending my wages. - Extra hours are paid at the end. Is 500 alright? - Could it be 1000? Thank you. - You're welcome. Show up on Monday. - Oh well... Look what the cat dragged in. - Don't greet me like that. Do you want to know what's been going on with me? - Wouldn't you like to know what's been happening with me? - No. - Forget it. - Have you got any tobacco? Give me a pack and three beers. - What about the bottles? - I'll bring them back later. I can open one here, can't I? Why don't you bring two glasses and we can drink it together. Go on. - Who was he? What was his name? - What's that noise? - Delfi... and his instrument. - Seriously? - Yeah. He's there all day. Come in. Delfi. All good? - Hello, Delfín. - Hi, Julia. - How are you? - Fine, and you? - What's that trumpet? - It's not a trumpet, it's a horn. They gave it to me at school. - They gave it to you? - They lent it to me until Monday. Tomorrow we're going to Junín. How cool. What are you going to do? Go to the cinema? - No, not to the cinema. - No, we're going to a trial for an orchestra. - Awesome. - Alright, cut that out. - Now? - No, right now. Not afterwards, go on. - Shall I pour you a little? - No, are you crazy? - A little sip, man. It's fine. - No, no. - Besides, he's big now. How old are you? - I turn twelve in August. - Alright, Ok. Have you eaten yet? - Yes. - Go to bed. You have to be refreshed to go to Junín tomorrow. Come on. Go to sleep, seriously. I'll be outside. - Let's go to Junín. Shall we go? Come on. - Name? - Delfín Valdez. - Age? - I turn twelve on the 21st of August. - Eleven. Who did you come with? - With my Dad. - Where is he? - He's waiting for me outside. - Instrument? - French horn. - You brought an instrument? - Yes. - All done. Go through. - That's enough, Joaquin, thank you. Next up... Clara. Clara, what have you prepared? - Romance by Saint-Saëns, Opus 36. - Magnificent choice. - Chief, what time did the bus to Junín leave? - The last one was at 10 o'clock. - When does the next one leave? - Half past three in the afternoon. - Were you here at ten when it left? - Yes. - Did you see a little eleven year-old boy? He was travelling alone. - They wouldn't have let an eleven year-old travel alone. - Thanks. - Totzsa. - What's up? - I'm looking for Delfi. - Today's Saturday, he doesn't come in today. - I know he doesn't come on Saturdays. We were going to go to Junín but he's gone on his own. Did you give him money? - No, he asked me for some... but I told him I didn't want any more trouble with you. - Little piece of shit, he always does the same thing. - You should start worrying a little more about him. - What? - Nothing, go on. - Why don't you worry about your own things... and leave me to look after Delfi and my things? - Go on, get off. Go on, get off. Get out of here! - All I needed was you teaching me how to raise my son. - Get out, get out. - Go back to your own country. - Get in. - Good morning. I'm looking for my son who came for an audition here today. - Name? - Valdez. - Yes, here he is. Delfín Valdez. Maestro. - Delfín Valdez. - I couldn't take his audition. - Why not? - He can't read music. He doesn't have basic knowledge of music theory. - So you didn't even listen to him play? - Neither him nor the others who were in the same situation. It's not a music school, it's an orchestra. What instrument does he play? - French horn. - Very difficult. There's no-one in the area who can teach him. He'd have to travel to La Plata. - La Plata? So what did he say? - I don't know, I don't remember what each one says. More than forty children came. - Fifty two. - Thanks a lot. Come on. Thanks. Let's go. - In general, they turn up before the police get involved. What I recommend is for you to go to a radio station... ask them to make an announcement... or publish on social media. - No, what social media are you talking about? This is real life, buddy. I'm telling you there's a eleven year-old boy... who travelled fifteen miles and is alone. We don't know where he is. - Hopefully he's on his way back. - Forgive us, oficial. He's worried because the boy grew up in the country... and this is a large city. - Forty-eight hours have to pass before I can do anything. Ok? That's the protocol. If you want, I'll help you. - No, don't make me waste time. Why did you bring me? I told you it was pointless. - Listen to him. - I told you it was pointless. I'm telling you a little eleven year-old boy has disappeared. Do you understand me? He's disappeared. - And do you understand me? I'm explaining that it's something that happens regularly. Your son has probably hidden... and he must be heading home now. It's a call for attention to his parents. - Are you a psychologist now as well? - Calm down, Luis. - Prick. As well as a pig, you're a psychologist? - That's enough, Luis, leave it. - Are you trying to be funny? - We'll come back. We'll come back. We'll go and calm down then come back. - It's not like that, Luis. That's not how things work. - What is that name? - My mum chose it for me. - Your name is your destiny. That was the ancients used to say. - There were some sailors, they were pirates. They were in the port on the point of setting sail... and a man approached them and asked them to please take him. The captain said no, no, no. No way. And they left for the high seas. They were in the middle of the ocean and strange things started to happen. The oars turned into serpents... and suddenly they saw the man that they'd left behind... who then turned into a lion, jumped aboard and ate the captain. So, the sailors were terrified. They jumped overboard and when they fell in the water... they turned into dolphins. - Alright, ladies... You're checking out of the suite. - I'll see him tomorrow. - Hey. Up. Get up. Hey. That's the last time you do something like that. Get up. Do you think that you can go waltzing around everywhere at eleven years of age? Get up. - I'm tired. - You're tired? I didn't close my eyes all night. But look, now you're tired. You're going to listen to me... and you're going to do it now, not when you feel like it. Get up. Get up. Do you want to tell me how you got there? - By hitching, a truck took me. You're irresponsible, Delfín. I'm going to kill you. You're eleven. - You already knew you weren't going to go. I told you it was important for me. - What was important? You couldn't even take the audition. All this infernal mayhem for nothing. Don't you know that's not how things work? - How do things work? - I don't know, but certainly not like that. I'd die if anything happened to you, Delfín. - What's going to happen to me? - Me and your mum thought we would be traveling all our lives. She was always cool like that. She said that one shouldn't stay anywhere for too long. - Sometimes I feel like I knew her. - You did know her. - I can't believe that you went to Junín on your own. You're crazy. You're really crazy. - And where did I get those ideas from? We were supposed to stay one night in this house... and we've stayed for three years. Who taught me to travel like that? Three years. Not bad for a place like this. - Where will we settle? - Look, in that direction we have Mendoza... Córdoba... Santa Fe... And over there... Bahía Blanca... Mar del Plata... the South. - Where did you meet mum? - There's nothing left there. Nothing at all. - Still... - Well, over there. Delfi!
