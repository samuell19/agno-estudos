"Bell Chamber" Laura... -You should call me Sis. -Laura. Let's play hide-and-seek! Hurry up! Let's go! I'll give you chocolate. Let my Sis join you! Mummy says I shouldn't play with her! I won't let you bully my Sis! We won't play with her... It's fine, Sis. We can play with just the two of us. I don't need your pity! Sis, play with me. Come on, let's go. Sis, let's play with just the two of us. Turn around! Sis! Help me! Help! Help me! Sis, help me! Help me, Sis! Sis, help me! Sis, I'll give you chocolate. Help me! Sis, I'll give you chocolate. Help me! Sis, help me! Don't worry. We'll arrive soon. Tong-tong. Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong. Mum, I'm home. Would you give my card to her? Tell her to call me if she needs anything. I should go. Thank you. Thank you. Tong-tong, are you up here? Where are you hiding? Tong-tong. Mummy. Tong-tong. Do you like it here? Yes. We're going to live here. Would you like that? But I still want to go home. This is our home now. We'll start afresh here. Auntie. Your lawyer left you this. He said you could call him if you need. Come on. Let's check out your room. Your mother had kept it for you. It's the same after 30 years. What is it? Nothing. I... Maybe I'm just tired. Perhaps a fuse is burnt. I'll check it out. Who is it? Tong-tong. Tong-tong. What is it? Let's go. Tong-tong. You can't escape me! Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong, where are you? Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Over here! Come and get me! Come and get me! Tong-tong, what are you doing? Come on, come and get me. Tong-tong. Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong. What are you doing? I'm playing with Laura. Laura? Who's Laura? What are you playing? What's with all the ruckus? It's late. I'm sorry, Auntie. We'll go to bed now. Tong-tong, cut it out. Mummy is drawing. Mummy! Mummy, Laura drew this. Auntie. Is there a kid who lives nearby? There isn't even another house around. Why would there be a kid? The kid! There's a kid in the attic. The attic is locked. No one's been up there for years. Why would there be a kid? No way. This can't be. I just went in there. Where's the key? You should not go in there. Auntie, believe me. There was a kid in there. There really was a kid. You're a caged bird. No, I'm not a caged bird. Sis, let me out. Stop grabbing at me. No, I won't let you out. Sis, come on. I'll be good. Come on. -Fly! -Let's fly! -Turn into a bird and fly! -Let's fly! Su Yun. Haven't you had enough? Tong-tong, what are you doing? Playing hide-and-seek. Playing hide-and-seek? With whom? Laura. Laura? Is she a kid who lives nearby? Laura is just Laura. There is no Laura. Stop playing with Laura, all right? Be good, Tong-tong. Mummy will play with you tomorrow. Don't play with Laura any more, all right? Come on, let's go to sleep. Good girl. Why are you screaming in the middle of the night? Aunt, there's a ghost! I've lived here all my life, but I've never seen a ghost. It must be the bronze sculpture in the attic. It must be that thing! He was my son and your Little Bro. It's just a way to remember him like a spirit tablet. No! I saw him! A little boy. He wanted to hurt me! He wanted to hurt Tong-tong! He can't hurt anyone. He's dead. I'm the only one who remembers him. Sis, look! It's a bird. Sis, I want to be a bird too. I can take you to fun places and eat all sorts of chocolate. Get in. You're a caged bird. No, I'm not a caged bird. Sis, let me out. Stop grabbing at me. No, I won't let you out. Sis, come on. I'll be good. Come on. -Fly! -Let's fly! -Turn into a bird and fly! -Let's fly! Mummy. Mummy... Mummy, are you drawing Laura? Tong-tong, go play on your own. But you promised you'd play with me. All right. Let's go then. -Mummy... -Where did you find this camera? I'll take lots of pictures of you, okay? Yes! Tong-tong. Slow down. Tong-tong, let me take a picture for you. 1, 2, 3. Tong-tong, let's take another one. 1, 2, 3. Another... 1, 2, 3. Mummy. Mummy, what are you doing? Mummy, what's wrong? I'm fine. I'm fine. Mummy, why are you leaving me? Tong-tong, why are you here? Why are you leaving me? -Come on! I'm here. -Let's play. -Come and get me! -You can't get me! -Come and get me! -Hurry up! I'll kill you, you witch! I'll kill you, witch! I'll kill you! Sis, let's play hide-and-seek. Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Open the door, Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong, are you all right? Mummy, what's wrong? It's all right now. It's over. What's the matter? Mummy, I want to play with Laura. No! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Tong-tong, give it to me! What are you doing? Are you out of your mind? Give it back to me! It's all I've left. I'm begging you! It'll kill Tong-tong! My son is dead! Can't you just leave me something to remember him by? "Low-carbon travel and green living" What's going on? Please, take this away. It's just a bronze sculpture. What's your problem with it? It'll kill Tong-tong. You don't believe me? -Where are you going? -I'll take this away myself. All right, give it to me. I'll take this away. Take care of yourself. Sis, let's play. Sis... Sis, let's play, all right? I'm sorry. Auntie. I remember Little Bro gave me chocolate. I remember you treated me so well when I was small. Thank you, Auntie. But... You've lost your son. I can't lose Tong-tong. Please forgive me. I won't let Little Bro hurt Tong-tong. Mummy. Let's go. The queen gave birth to a little princess. She had skin as white as snow and hair as dark as ebony. No. She had skin white like mine and hair dark like mine. All right. The little princess was named Tong-tong. No, I'm Tong-tong. This is Princess Tong-tong. Mummy, when will you finish your comic? Probably by your birthday. That's great! The comic will be my birthday gift. Auntie. Tong-tong. Let's make chocolate, shall we? Mummy, you know how to make chocolate? All right, this is nearly done. All right, let me mix it. Let's do it together. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... -The chocolate is done! -It smells so nice! Auntie. Come. Auntie. It's chocolate, the angel of happiness. Auntie. Tong-tong and I made this chocolate for you. We hope it can cheer you up. Tong-tong, you and I... We're family, right? I'm tired. Leave me. Mummy. It's chocolate, the angel of happiness! She's had a rough life. Leave her be. There was an old butler. The old butler had a son called Zan. Zan wanted to be friends with Princess Tong-tong. But it was late and it was bedtime for Princess Tong-tong. Mummy. The little princess wants the queen to stay with her tonight. Of course, my princess. Tong-tong, what are you doing? Mummy, we're playing hide-and-seek. Tong-tong... Auntie, help! Tong-tong has been hurt! Open up! Auntie! Please, Tong-tong is hurt. -Please help her! -All right. Go to the living room. I'll be there in a minute. It's late. Just treat the wound and get back to sleep. Auntie, did you hear the nursery rhyme? Why would I hear a nursery rhyme so late at night? He's back. He's still here. You threw it away. What more do you want from me? Mummy. -It hurts. -Tong-tong. Tong-tong, you're awake. Tong-tong, are you all right now? I'm sorry... Tong-tong, please be safe. Don't scare me like that again, all right? Don't scare me like that. Please be safe. Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong, are you okay? I won't let you get hurt. It's all right. It's all right. Mummy's here. It's all right. Mummy, I don't want to play hide-and-seek any more. Tong-tong, it's all right. Mummy's here with you. I'll protect you. The police are here. I'll come out after I get changed. What did they say? The police said they'd investigated the room. That's not blood, but red paint. And there's no sign of break-in. It's not a break-in. It's him! I know it's him! -I saw it. I saw him! -Who did you see? Didn't you take him away? Where did you take him? Mummy. Tong-tong, why are you out? Why aren't you sleeping in your room? Your hand... Sis. Let's play hide-and-seek, all right? Tong-tong. Where's Tong-tong? Have you seen her? No. Auntie! Auntie, have you seen Tong-tong? Tong-tong! Tong-tong... Tong-tong, where are you? Tong-tong, where are you? Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Where are you? Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong! We're playing hide-and-seek. And Tong-tong doesn't have much time. Tong-tong! Sis, let's play with just the two of us. Turn around. Sis! Help me! Help! Help me! Sis, help me! Help me, Sis! Sis, help me! Sis, I'll give you chocolate. Help me! Sis, I'll give you chocolate. Help me! Sis, help me! Tong-tong. Tong-tong. Tong-tong! Tong-tong! Tong-tong... Tong-tong... Tong-tong, please be okay! Tong-tong, are you all right? Wake up! Wake up and look at Mummy! No... Tong-tong, please wake up. Tong-tong! I'm begging you! Please leave Tong-tong alone. Take my life instead, please! Let her go. I'll stay with you. Tong-tong! Laura... You should call me Sis. Let's play hide-and-seek. Come on! Let's go! I'll give you chocolate. Let my Sis join you! Mummy says I shouldn't play with her! I won't let you bully my Sis! We won't play with her... It's fine, Sis. We can play with just the two of us. I don't need your pity! Sis, let's play! I'm sorry... Sis, don't cry. Don't cry. I've never blamed you. I just want you to stop blaming yourself. It's chocolate, the angel of happiness. Tong-tong... Are you all right? Tong-tong, open your eyes and look at Mummy! Look at Mummy! -Mummy? -You're all right now. You're all right now. You're all right now. Su Yun. What's wrong? Auntie. It's over. It's all right now. I... I'll put her to bed first. It's over? Mummy, what's wrong? Tong-tong. Mummy loves you more than anything in the world. You know that, don't you? Mummy, I love you too. Good girl. Tong-tong. Do you want the princess doll to sleep with you? Mummy, the princess doll is gone. I'll look for it. Tong-tong, get some sleep. Mummy won't let you get hurt any more. Mummy. We'll always be together. We'll always be together. We'll be together forever. Be good. Close your eyes and get some sleep. Auntie. Auntie, I'm sorry. Auntie, I'm sorry. Little Bro died because of me. I'm going to get some meds from the hospital. Do you want to come with me? All right, I'll get a taxi. Go get your things. Mum. I've let go of the past. Laura, let's play hide-and-seek, all right? I don't want to play hide-and-seek. Be good. You can have chocolate if you play hide-and-seek. Come on. Stay quiet until Mummy finds you. All right? I'll kill you, witch! Come here! You witch! I'll kill you! I'm killing you today! Die! How dare you fight back! How dare you hit me! Die! Mummy. Why did Daddy hit us? Was it because of Little Bro? "Antipsychotic Drugs" Antipsychotic Drugs? "Usage" Mummy, are you drawing Laura? Tong-tong, go play on your own. But you promised you'd play with me. All right. Let's go then. Let's play. Mummy. The little princess wants the queen to stay with her tonight. Of course, my princess. Mummy, higher! Mummy, higher! Tong-tong. Tong-tong. Tong-tong. Tong-tong... Tong-tong! I'm sorry... Tong-tong, where are you? Tong-tong... Tong-tong, where are you? Please be safe. Please be safe, Tong-tong! Tong-tong, where are you? Tong-tong! Tong-tong, where are you? Tong-tong... Stop hiding! I'm worried! Tong-tong, where are you? Please, you're scaring me! Tong-tong... Tong-tong... Mummy! Mummy! Mummy, help me! Mummy! Let her go! Mummy! Mummy, save me! I'll save you! Tong-tong, it'll be all right! I'm coming to save you! -What did you do to Tong-tong? -Su Yun, what are you doing? What did you do to Tong-tong? -What did you do to her? -Su Yun, calm down. -Give Tong-tong back to me! -Calm down! Give Tong-tong back to me! Give her back to me! Give her back to me! Open the door! Open it! Open up... Give Tong-tong back to me! Give Tong-tong back to me! Tong-tong! Give her back to me! Give her back! Tong-tong, Mummy's coming to save you! Tong-tong! Su Yun, listen to me. Tong-tong! Where did you hide her? Tong-tong is long gone. She's dead! "Girl died from domestic abuse" Mummy! Mummy... Tong-tong! Mummy, help me! Don't hurt her! I won't let you hurt Mummy! Don't hurt her! Mummy! Don't hurt her! Mummy, save me! Mummy! Tong-tong! Please, let her go! Tong-tong! -Mummy... -Tong-tong! Mummy, the princess doll is gone. I'll look for it. Tong-tong, get some sleep. "Girl died from domestic abuse" Tong-tong. Su Yun, it's all in your mind. You're sick, Su Yun. You grew up in this house in Yunnan. There isn't a Laura. And Tong-tong has never been here. I know you've been suffering, my daughter, but you can't trap yourself in your own mind. Wake up, Su Yun. Tong-tong. Mummy loves you more than anything in the world. Believe me, you'll get better. Su Yun... Mummy, I love you too. We'll always be together. We'll always be together. It's a lie! Su Yun! You're no one! If your father wasn't rich, would I have married you? Yet he left all his fortune to your aunt! He'd rather leave it to someone else than his own daughter! You're no one! You're a useless witch! You're useless too! Die with your mother! Su Yun, are you all right? Su Yun... Are you all right? Tong-tong. Tong-tong! A psychologist? She's very guarded. I have to pretend to be a lawyer to earn her trust. What's all this about? Su Yun's daughter died from domestic abuse. The shock was so huge to her that she developed borderline personality disorder. It's usually rooted in abandonment or traumatic experience from childhood, and triggered by a shocking event one experience as an adult. What can I do? She believes that Tong-tong is alive and lives with her. Just let her be. You may take pictures or whatnot to record her life. At the right time, let her understand that Tong-tong is dead. Mummy. Mummy, I have to go. Please live a good life even without me. Auntie. What will we do from now on? It's sunny today. Mummy. What will we do from now on? There is no "we". It'll be just you. Laura. Go live with your grandparents. Why? Because it's sunny over there. It's sunny there. The sun will come out sooner or later. "Su Yun's condition improved after receiving treatments." "She lived a new life in Beijing" "Su Yun's aunt sold the ancestral home in Yunnan," "and moved to live with Su Yun in Beijing" "Su Yun's husband's abuse" "caused the death of his daughter and injured his wife." "He's been arrested" "and will be severely punished by the law."
