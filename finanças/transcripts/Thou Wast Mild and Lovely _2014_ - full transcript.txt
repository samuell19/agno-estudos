(crickets chirping) - Oh, my god, no, not the chicken. (laughing) You eat your dinner, young lady. You eat your dinner. (screaming) She stabbed me with a chicken! She stabbed me with a chicken! (screaming) (laughing) - You eat your dinner, sweet puff. - [Girl] You got it all over my dress. - [Man] Whether you like it or not. It sure looked pretty real didn't it? - [Girl] Where'd you get this thing? - [Man] It's just a god damn Thanksgiving decoration. - [Girl] Damn it. (man coughing) How am I gonna get this out? - [Voiceover] For all my life, I missed my lover. I wanted my lover. I wanted to be near my lover. (dog growling) But the way my lover opened and closed my legs, the way my lover folded and unfolded me into my lover's breast, my lover knows how to love me. (dog barking) (gentle music) But things kept getting in the way of my lover and I could not be with my lover. Until now. (dog barking) (woman humming) - [Jeremiah] What do you do in your free time makin'? You're not drawing shingles off of roofs. - [Akin] I make beer. - [Jeremiah] What? You don't talk much, do you, boy? - Sorry, sir. - Don't apologize. No, no, nope, that's Sarah's job, let her do that. - [Voiceover] Hey, babe. I'm just calling because um... I had this dream. It was our wedding day and Daddy gave me away to you and... When you lifted the veil... Your face just went away. You were just like a black hole or and I woke up with this feeling in my stomach. I just wish you would come home. (alarm shrieking) - [Sarah] Good morning. - Thought you wanted me to do that. - No, I was up early, you can do it tomorrow. You have a little one? - What? No. - I would have a baby right now if Daddy would let me. The last guy who worked here had five kids. Did you hear me? - [Akin] Yep. * He said murder, he said every time * He said murder, he says at a time like this * So murder he says * Is that language of love * He says barn, he says * Take me in his arms * Barn he says, meet no charm * He says barn, he says (gun fires) (TV singer murmuring) (gun fires) - [Jeremiah] We're gonna have to make some more decisions. (Sarah crying) I know it's gonna be hard to look at. All right? Hello, sweetie. Come in and say good bye to her sweetheart. - [Sarah] Come on. It's okay. Yeah. - [Jeremiah] Sweet baby, yes. (creaking) - [Voiceover] My lover did not fall down from the sky or grow up from the earth. My lover does not have hands like hands I've known. My lover can touch me everywhere at once. (gentle music) - [Jeremiah] How much work you've done in your life, son. If I can just pick the fork up to your mouth. - [Akin] I usually do cellar work, carpentry and house paint. - I ask you to do house painting with scraggled up shoulders like that. Somebody tell you to say that, son? - [Akin] No, sir. - [Sarah] He used to work in a school, Robin told us that. - There's just something about the way you carry yourself. The way about you walk. You just carry a lot of tension in your shoulders. Like you got a secret that you don't want anyone to know, or maybe you're gay. - You want some more peas? - [Akin] No thank you. - It's not a typical gay walk, but... You know there's something gay about it all of a sudden. Give Sarah your plate if you're done. (grunting) Sarah, we got another sulker, huh? Looks like we hire one every summer. Sulker. - [Voiceover] My lover did not know I was waiting for my lover. (gentle music) But I held my lover like a knife holds its bread. I could feel through my body. And how to become close to my lover. And how to become close to my lover. (crickets chirping) - [Jeremiah] You know any constellation, shoulders? (twig snapping) (rumbling) - [Sarah] Are you following me? - [Akin] No. - [Sarah] Are you sure? (Sarah singing) - [Jeremiah] You okay, son? - Yes, sir. (cows groaning) - You don't like him, do you, girl? (humming) (radio singing in foreign language) (dramatic music) (Sarah laughing) - I wanna come home. Hello? Nothing's wrong. I shouldn't have come. I know that we need the money. - [Voiceover] Come home, babe, I miss her. - [Akin] I miss her too. (breathing heavily) (clunking) (uneasy music) - Jeremiah! Daddy! Jeremiah! - [Jeremiah] Yeah. - [Sarah] Cows got out. I can't find Flowers. - [Jeremiah] Well saddle up, we'll go look for her. All right? - [Sarah] Okay. - [Jeremiah] Kite where she roams. Shoulders, come here. Come here, I want you to show him the property line all right, where that fence needs a fix. - [Sarah] Okay. Come on. (gentle music) You got a long life ahead if you work cattle and you don't ride horses. - [Akin] I just don't get along with him real well. - [Sarah] Did one kick you? - [Akin] Hm? - [Sarah] Did you get kicked when you were young? - [Akin] Yeah, maybe. - [Sarah] Well, did you or didn't you? - [Akin] No, I didn't get kicked. - [Sarah] Knock knock. - [Akin] Who's there? - [Sarah] Boo. - [Akin] Boo who? (Sarah laughing) - Hi, Flowers. Come here. Did you go no a little adventure? Oh, my god. I just saw one. Did you ever catch frogs when you were little, Akin? - [Akin] No. - [Sarah] Really? - [Akin] I don't like amphibians. - Really, I love them. Ah. Oh! - [Akin] I don't like anything that slithers. - [Sarah] I do. It almost went in my shirt. (laughs) That feels so funny. Whoa. Bad frog. No, no. (grunting) (flies buzzing) (grunting and groaning) (cow groaning) (cow groaning) Come on, Flowers, get, go, go, go, go. (breathing heavily) - [Jeremiah] You like to cook, Akin? A man should know how to cook green beans. - [Akin] Yeah, I cook green beans. I mostly just cook simple things. - Type of things like eggs. A man should know how to cook eggs. - [Akin] I can make eggs. - I'll bet you can. You look to me like a man who would send his clothes out to the laundry. Is that true? - [Akin] I mean I've never been to one. - How do you do your wash? - [Akin] Well we have a washing machine. - Who's we? - [Akin] Me and my room mate. - [Jeremiah] Does room mate have a name? - [Akin] Christopher. - [Jeremiah] We... We sort of have a room mate here, don't we, Sarah? Lives out in the barn. It's amazing how long you can keep somebody alive, you just clean their wounds. We have had issues with buzzards. (dog barking) You know. It doesn't bother me, son, if somebody lies to me. You got a tan line around your finger, son. You've been hiding that you're married. Hoping to get a little action in the summer? - No, sir. - [Jeremiah] Yeah, and if you are, you're more than welcome to. Oh, by the way, thank you for doing that milking. That's gonna be your regular job now, all right? - Yes, sir. (footsteps tapping) Hey. That's my job. - [Sarah] I know. - [Akin] Why are you doing my job? - Ah, well, I like to, you can do another job. Hey, your wife's real pretty. - What? - [Sarah] You already have a baby, you lied about that. - [Akin] Where'd you get that? - Door was unlocked. That's what happens when a door is unlocked. - This is my personal property. - [Sarah] Your personal what? - Look, please, don't go into my room again. - [Sarah] I can't promise that, Akin. - [Akin] Why not? - [Sarah] Well... - Why not? - [Sarah] Let's go. Yeah. (cow groaning) (mysterious music) (breathing heavily) * You are * The one * My only one * The only one * I would go * You are the sun * The stars, the earth * You make life worth * Living for * I've only had a single dream * It just goes on * It only has a single dream * With a single for * That you are the one (clanking) (Sarah laughing) - [Sarah] No, stop, no, please. (Jeremiah laughing) (kettle whistling) (Sarah humming) - [Voiceover] That's disgusting, you know what? I bet that you would like to be a beer. (laughing) Just a beer coming out of a bottle, glug, glug, glug. He and I would both drink it, how do you feel about that? - [Voiceover] Well I'd be a. I'd drink a beer. - [Voiceover] Squeeze some hopps out of you. Come on, little buddy, let's go. Come on, let's get us some beer. - [Voiceover] I wanna see that hop. (group shouting at once) - [Voiceover] Come on. Come on, give me the break. Oh, (smooches) to you too. Lay it out. - [Voiceover] We'll milk beer out of him. (men murmuring) - [Voiceover] Well this is shoulders' cave. - [Voiceover] Oh, look at this here. - [Voiceover] Oh, yeah. Oh, my god. How many gallons is that, shoulders? - [Voiceover] You can drink all that tonight. (men murmuring) That's so cute, it's like a little baby. - [Voiceover] Is that your baby? - [Voiceover] Is it? - [Voiceover] It's shoulder's little baby, oh, little baby. (laughing) - [Voiceover] Is this how you sleep, shoulders? You just curl up against your little baby? (laughing) (gentle music) - [Jeremiah] She said no you're not. In every human being, there exists two wolves and they fight and one wolf is goodness, gratitude, graciousness, love. The other one is evil, the other one is hate, judgment, all the bad things and they fight together and the little boy said which wolf wins? - [Sarah] Akin. - [Akin] Yeah. - [Sarah] Why did you start making beer? - [Akin] What? - Why did you start making beer? - Oh, I think it's a little hard to explain. - [Sarah] I wanna hear. - [Akin] Well... I guess I just like the feeling of drinking something that I made. - That's it, that's a long story? You interrupted my story for that commercial? - Well, I mean, with cooking, you just still pretty much have the same thing. If you cook an egg, you still just have an egg. But with beer, you're actually transforming something. I mean you're taking water and you're making alcohol out of it. You're changing water and you're making poison. - You're like a witch. You're just like a witch, that's what witches do. You even have a point on the end of your nose and a mole right here. Yeah, a yellow one with 10 wooly black hairs coming out of it. All your little brothers are witches too and they help you carve out the kids' eye, you can make like chuck cookies. Get stuck in his mustache. (frantic music) (laughing) - [Akin] This guy was the biggest, meanest guy on the football team. They turn the lights on, hundreds of rats, just like a wall of rat eyes. (Akin and Sarah drowned out by frantic music) (laughing) Aren't I giving enough on that side? - So, now, are you telling me to halt 'cause both sides are pulling. - Oh, I see. - Right? - [Akin] Right. So I'll just have to stay close enough to, wait, why are you turning? - I don't know, I thought I was going to bump into something. - Well, come on, you have to trust me. - (laughs) Okay. - [Jeremiah] If you hadn't insisted on keeping her alive, we wouldn't have to sell. - [Sarah] Why are you doing business with them? - [Jeremiah] 'Cause they pay me that's why. - [Sarah] Last time you sold them a cow, they shorted us money. - [Jeremiah] That was a mistake, they called about that. - Was it a mistake? People who have money know how to make money. Their guilding is completely barn sour. Yesterday they reared out and came down with some kid cowboy, some trainer they have but we weren't as third, now they say we gotta put him down. - [Jeremiah] Well they probably should. - Yeah, well I told them I'd work with it. Horses are gallivanting , he was five, you can't lock up a horse that's been a stallion his whole life. - [Akin] I think he wanted us to start dinner early. - [Sarah] Yeah, well it's just a little further. Do you have too many friends? - Yeah. No. - [Sarah] What's your wife like? - She's a good mom. I don't know, I don't really think about it. She's kind of like you, I guess. - [Voiceover] Dear family, leave us your number and we might call you back. - [Voiceover] Hey, guys, sorry to bother you, I got your home number from Robin. I was wondering. I just haven't heard from Akin in awhile, so if you can have him call me back or if someone is there, it's his wife. Is anyone home? - No way. - [Akin] There you go. - You can do that. I thought you were lying to me. - Then you give me 200. (phone ringing) - [Jeremiah] Good Lord. - [Sarah] What are you at, what are you at, are you catching? - You ready? - [Sarah] Okay, I'm catching, I'll catch it. (shouting) I can't do it. - Send them back. - [Sarah] One, two. - [Jeremiah] It's for you. - [Sarah] Three. - [Akin] It is? - [Jeremiah] Uh-huh. - Hello? - [Voiceover] Hi, honey, how's it over there? - [Akin] It's fine. - [Voiceover] Jeremiah invited us for a visit. - [Akin] He did? - [Voiceover] Yeah, (mumbles) I said of course. - Why, that's great. - [Voiceover] So we're gonna be out there next Thursday, I guess. He said he was gonna pick us up and everything. - Wow, babe, that's really, that's... Um, how's Jack doing? - [Voiceover] He's still tiny, babe. But he only cries through half of his music class today so that's an improvement. - Yeah, that's great. Um... Well I'm really looking forward to seeing ya. Are you gonna bring Jack? - [Voiceover] Yeah, yeah, I am. - So... Who was that? - [Akin] It was my wife. She's gonna come visit. (rock music) (mysterious music) - There, little stranger. - [Girl] Doggies, whoa. - It's a catch. (cheering and clapping) - [Girl] Last time he couldn't find it. (kids chattering) - It's been all right. It's been an all right summer though. - You like it here? - That's the ball, that's the ball. Look that's the ball. Who's that, who's that? That's Mama. (toy squeaking) That's Mummy. (chattering drowned out by somber music) He's adorable. Hello. I thought she was going to be a girl from the picture. - [Voiceover] Do you land over here too? (chattering) - The whole time there's a guy staring at me with a beer in each hand, so we're swaying and I think I said to him and this was our second date, second date, I think I said to him, "Why don't you take me out a few more times "and bring some wine." (laughing) What about you guys? - [Voiceover] Well. - [Voiceover] Heard this 100 times. - I asked Richard actually, you know, he was playing all hard to get on the road a lot and I said, "Richard, I wanna settle down, "have a home and if you can't do that, "I'll ask Jeffrey." Jeffrey was our neighbor, and he said yes. - I suppose that's the way it happened. Coercion, that's the only thing it's good for. - [Woman] Do you know where Cooper went? - So you said yes the next time? - I did, I was drunk, but I meant it. It's hard not to want a man with so much silence in him. Makes it easier around the house. (laughing) - I haven't found him to be so silent. - [Wife] No. - [Sarah] No, he talks to me. - Does he? - [Sarah] I guess so. - [Jeremiah] Well, would anybody like more pie? - [Voiceover] Oh, no. (group chattering at once) - It's good. - What did you tell them, Akin? Did you tell them about your family? - [Jeremiah] Well, he told us about his hops. (laughing) - [Voiceover] His god damn hippity hops. (laughing) - [Jeremiah] Also told us he didn't have a wife. Fact, he just put his wedding ring back on today. - He told me about you, Drew, he told me you were beautiful and bewitching, I think he said. - That's nice, anything else? - You have a kid. - That's good he told you that. - [Jeremiah] I wouldn't judge him too hard. Every man wants a little action, right, Richard? - [Richard] Yep. - [Voiceover] Well just stay awake long enough for me to get you home. - [Jeremiah] Well what this table needs is some music. (joyful music) - [Drew] She's nice. I wouldn't blame you if you liked her. - [Akin] I like you. - Akin, what you got? Got some can in a beer. - [Akin] Mine aren't ready yet. (laughing) - Too hops out of a year if I have to. (laughing) Come on, come on, come on. (men talking at once) Your wife is really cute, shoulders. Pretty, pretty girl. - Akin. - Akin. - [Akin] Yeah, baby. - [Drew] Akin. - She never gets this drunk. - [Jeremiah] No? - She's pretty drunk now, would you say? - Yeah. - So... What kind of panties does she got on, Akin? Huh? What do you wanna do to her? What do you wanna do to her when she's just lying there half dead? What do you like? - I think she had more than just beer. (Drew moaning) You okay, sweetie? - [Jeremiah] You ever lay out a calf, shoulders? - [Akin] No, I haven't. - [Jeremiah] Horses, they easy as pie, anybody can breed one of them, but a cervix you could drive a truck through you. Just throw that semen in there like you would in a javelin but a cow. A cow takes precision. A cow take finesse. A cow takes a very, very precise hand with a very, very impious syringe. - [Sarah] Gently down. - So I'm wondering now. Is shoulders a horseman... Or is shoulders a cow man? (crickets chirping) - [Drew] I don't wanna go. I wanna stay with you. - [Jeremiah] Hey boy. I got something I wanna tell you. You know I'm not Sarah's dad. - [Akin] What? - [Jeremiah] You listenin'? I can smell your vagina. (laughs) (Drew moaning) (uneasy music) - Shoulders. (murmuring) It nobody's your mom. - [Akin] Drew? Drew? Are you feeling okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - [Akin] Okay. Really? - Yeah, Akin. - Look at what Drew showed me. Isn't that beautiful? Drew told me about your daughter. It's a big thing to keep on your shoulders. - Yeah. I guess I don't like to talk about it. - [Sarah] Sorry I gave you a hard time about the horses. - [Drew] I'm hungover already and it's not even tomorrow. (Akin chuckles) - [Sarah] What is that one? - [Drew] You have good shoulders. - [Sarah] You look like a superhero. - You look like somebody who's about to get shot. - [Sarah] No, keep it on, keep it on. - [Akin] What are you guys doing? - [Sarah] Can you feel, almost touch it. (heavy breathing) (insects chirping) (groaning) (moaning) (grunting) (laughing) - I see that in the movies. - Fuck. - Can I go next? - Did she ask you? - Not yet. (shouting) (Akin and Sarah murmuring) - [Jeremiah] Get out your tongue, little girl. Come on, give it. - [Akin] Baby, come on, get up, let's get out of here. (Sarah screams) (unsettling music) (screaming) (screaming) (shouting) (growling) (shrieking) (sqeuaking) - [Akin] Shh, shh. Where's the little boy, have you guys seen a little boy? (squeaking) - [Sarah] Don't go in, don't go in. - [Akin] Where's Drew? - [Sarah] Shh, I don't know. - [Akin] Where's Jack? - [Sarah] I don't know. (car horn honking) - [Jeremiah] Sarah! - Daddy? - [Jeremiah] Stop honking that god damn horn. - [Sarah] I thought I heard coyotes near the barn. - [Jeremiah] Then go check on it. - But someone's gotta stay with the kids. - Well then I'll check the fucking chicken. Yeah, yeah, shoulders. (Sarah shouting) You god damn. - Don't! - Or what? (Sarah shouts) (gun fires) (Jack crying) - Dad! (Sarah squealing) I am so sorry. - [Jeremiah] Listen to me. - [Sarah] I am so sorry. - [Jeremiah] It's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. - [Sarah] Daddy. - [Jeremiah] It's okay. - [Voiceover] If you're a woman or a man or a cow or a turtle, if you're the sky or you're the stars, if you're the stairwell, you might've seen my lover. My lover comes and goes. My lover is up with the birds when they're singing. My lover is in our fruits before we cry. My lover is stiller than stillness. When you meet my lover, you will fall in love. My lover is always there. You should not be afraid. You should not be afraid. Every little branch on a tree is shaking its head at you and every star in the sky is belling your name. And the big ones up top might be smiling down on you. Might be smiling just like a cow on the prairie smells on its grass every day. This is how I got to my lover and this is how my lover got to me. (Sarah crying) (Sarah screams) (gentle music) * I'll not be a stranger * When I get to that city * I'm acquainted with folks * Over there * There'll be friends there to greet me * There will be loved ones to meet me * At the gates of that city four square * Through the years, through the days * They've gone one by one * But they wait at the gate * Until my race is run * I'll not be a stranger * When I get to that city * I'm acquainted with folks * Over there * I'll not be a stranger * When I get to that city * I have a home on the streets * Paid with gold * I feel right at home there * In that beautiful somewhere * With a loved one whose memory I own * Through the years, through the days * They've gone one by one * But they wait at the gate * Until my race is run * I'll not be a stranger * When I get to that city * I'm acquainted with folks over there * I'll not be a stranger * When I get to that city * There'll be no lonely days * Over there * There'll be no stormy weather * But a great time together * On the streets of that city four square * Through the years, through the kids * They've gone one by one * But they wait at the gate * Until my race is run * I'll not be a stranger * When I get to that city * I'm acquainted with folks * Over there (country music) * Well, well, well, well * What kind of life you think we'll find * Keeping pain in our hearts * Nothin' but trouble in the mind * And rumors and gossip * Our lying lips do tell * By saying prayers to the devil * And the heaven were created is hell * Well, well, well, well * Got caught up in a spell * Jealousy and worry * And darkness is where we dwell * We can weep, we can moan * But we've reaped what we've sown * And we'll cry like a baby * As our love bids us farewell * Well, well, well, well
