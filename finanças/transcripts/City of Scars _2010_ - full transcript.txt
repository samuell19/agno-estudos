Arkham Asylum July 3rd then made known only as the Joker has escaped proving once again that the system is broken I've had to put my ongoing investigation of a serial killer Victor Zsasz on hold the Joker is always top priority his footprints into the West End sewer caverns this is why I'm here his path of destruction has already begun putting Arkham nurse twenty-three-year-old or Rebecca white in the hospital she had only been working at the asylum for two weeks the news coverage of this has spread like a raging fire today the people of Gotham are waking up to the Joker's words the zebra has escaped from the zoo to feast on the blood of the life ever since my parents deaths I rarely appeared the city in daylight but this alley I know too well I come here when I can no longer silence the demons in my head as with all children I look to my parents for help for an answer I'm not that insane the Gotham skyline towers home to councilman Johnson his wife and ten-year-old son earlier this evening the councilman and his son were kidnapped while his wife was brutally murdered by the Joker hearing this news tears have the only humanity that I have left another child stripped of its innocence by Gotham's underworld - kidnapped one dead can you confirm that joker was here well the preliminary evidence matches his profile are there any recognizable prints none this was very clean and precise there has to be something in here we can use all the evidence left here was intentional as always the city was the Joker bad there's a crowd already gathering outside of the hospital for that poor Arkham nurse I hate to say it could I blame Batman why look I know our city is dirty we know the only way to come clean is to put our faith in a force that's greater than the law a force that can take liberties where the law can't and we've given that force the power to stop this madness and it hasn't Gotham sick of Batman's conscience so am I to skill shift gears your Harley it seems that that the lack of conscience is what has created these freaks of Gotham this city will never know how lucky they are that I've never crossed that line because if I did step into that abyss I take all of Gotham with me he's here open his cell partly where is he I'm not supposed to talk to you two people are already dead their child is missing I thought he'd be with you by now you're always at the top of this dance card he doesn't care about you Harvey he's just using you that's why he needed your help to escape from Arkham me he'll come back he can't help himself he's going through something terrible you know this you know him better than anyone I don't know anything about a missing kid but I do know something about a little man owing him a favor and that he plans to cash a parlays reference to the little man was obvious he runs one of the dirtiest clubs in Gotham we go that's your friend my money yeah oops I could have taken the silent approach slipped in unnoticed but I'm looking to be noticed I need to make it clear that criminals will no longer be tolerated in Gotham that's night it ends I don't have time for your games Wesker you got something to say say it to me dummy where is he no idea you come in here off the track into my honest business and think you can put the screws in me Wesker why was the Joker here what did you want you read one word I'll put you in a wooden box No Wesker a child's life's in danger don't say a word she'll kill me act like a man you dummy no go to hell more time why was the Joker here I don't know something about Carnival did you like Carnival god councilman Johnson hey we got time for shriek real boy bomb pops are you sure you don't want any no well then how about a story once upon a time there was this fear slide who ruled over the land unfairly he would bully and scare all of the zebras sometimes in the devour them one day one delivers the challenges alive the councilman's body was bound two miles from here the missing child is now lost both of his parents deaths for safety first it's gonna be a great show your best oh boy tell me yeah where do you think you're going I placed a tracking device in the Joker before I let him go I knew he would lead me straight to the child oh it's you I see about my toy cow it's all fun and games here see give a little chain why didn't you save my parents the Joker was anything but anticlimactic which is exactly what this death is with all of his mischievious almost whimsical schemes the Joker was nothing to roll your eyes at every performance as he called him at a point even if a horrific death toll landed him back in Markham it was always part of his plan but this doesn't seem to follow any plan is it possible that this child was able to do what should have been done years ago is it really that black-and-white is this a victory is this a sign that the store is passing or getting worse I failed I failed my parents and most of all I failed him the batmanning says to make sure that what happened to Bruce Wayne never happens to anyone else how many more broken families exist because of the Joker's reign of terror a terror that I couldn't seem to end even in death the Joker is still getting the last laugh even without the Joker Gotham has a share of scars but for those that have amassed too many scholars it has pushed them over the edge have I been wrong all these years as I just too afraid to pull the trigger I can't believe that to be true but as my city and I grow older I began to doubt the choices that I've made I often ask myself if I were faced with the same situation but I've taken the life of my parents killer that is the question that has haunted me my entire life the only answer that I have is the life that I now live the answer to that question is that where there once was the sound of laughter ours a cold where they won't sing a thousand voices lies a graveyard we pray to heat where there one screw a beautiful garden now sow the seeds of kill where there once stood a proud soldier lies though the country his forefathers fail take a good look watch down to the city of scars you
