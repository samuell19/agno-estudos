Oh, I enjoyed it. Oh, Teddy, let's go through again. No, no. You'll make yourself ill. Besides, you've been around the beach house already. We'll have our tea now. The usual place? - The usual place. You still set on going home tomorrow? Yes, Teddy, We must. Well, it's a pity. That flu pulled you down a lot, you know. Yes, dear. But it's done me good being here. Spearmint tea today.. Blimey. Who's it gonna be, Moni? You, Teddy. Well, that'd be a surprise. Now listen. What do nice people have at tea time? Tea. And what do sensible people put in it? Oh, Teddy. You spoil me. You're worth spoiling. Spoon, Teddy. Oh, sorry. It's all right, dear. It's a big man who lets a woman teach him good manners. Who are you calling on? I wouldn't change you for 50 younger ones. It's been such a wonderful year. And coming back here again has reminded me of so much. We've had a lot of memories here, haven't we? It's been our second honeymoon, Teddy Bare. Our second honeymoon. Well, here we are. Safe and sound. That's Phillips car, isn't it? Yes, dear. What have you got in here? Hello, Emmie. Looking better, ma'am, aren't you? Just a little tired. Tired off the journey. Now you should take her indoors and look after her. I'll put the car away, Moni. Oh, yes. Thank you, dear. Good afternoon, Mrs. Bare. Oh, Phillip! And there's your chair waiting for you, ma'am. So you just sit back and rest yourself. And I'll bring you a nice cup of tea. All right. Toddle, Emmie. Toddle. It's good to be home again. Well, Phillip, you got my letter? Yes, I did. I, uh With all respect, Miss Bare, I don't feel happy about this. When I instruct my lawyer, Phillip, it's because I want him to carry out my wishes. Why must you make another will? One you made just after your marriage seems more than fair to me. Your husband gets this house. And your money goes back where it belongs. Back to the family. Back to my sister, you mean. Who else? She's your only relative. I haven't seen Dora for 20 years. She's a wealthy woman now. Her husband left her an enormous fortune. No. The little flu worried me. If anything happened. And I'm a good bit older than Teddy. I must know that he gets all my money. He's entitled to it. I feel bound to remind you, Mrs. Bare, that you're money came from a family business. Don't you think it should stay in the family? Teddy is my family. All the family I've got. Mrs. Bare. Has Edward been pressing you to make this will? Indeed, he hasn't. Teddy doesn't even know about the first will. I never told him. You're always very unfair to Teddy, Phillip. I always supposed your marriage to Edward was a mistake. Oh. Hello, Phillip. Good afternoon, Edward. Look. Got a surprise for you. Oh, pieces for my patchwork quilt. You clever boy. I bought you something else too.. How are you, Moni, now that you're at home? Better? Yes, but still very languid, Teddy dear. No energy. Influenza pulls down the constitution. Makes you feel very depressed. I know how to cure my wife's depression, Phillip. Ah, the princess of the tea cups. Where shall I put it, sir? Put it there, Emmie. Are you staying for tea? Thank you. But if you'll excuse me, I must be on my way. Now don't forget, Phillip. I want it here tomorrow morning ? ready to sign. Yes, Mrs. Bare. I can see you made your mind up. I'll be up in the morning. Don't bother to show me out, Edward. I can see you're tired. What's the matter with him? You ought to get up, dear, when visitors go. Oh, I can't stick him. He is just as rude to ladies. What brought Phillip here anyway? Hmm. There's your pair, Queen Moni. That's a good match, Teddy. You have an eye for color, haven't you, dear? Mmm. Why did he come? I asked him to call, dear. I must make a will, Teddy. A will, Moni? I'm so pleased with my pieces. Clever. Clever there. You always seem to have little ways to make me happy, aren't you, dear? Nothing's ever too much trouble. I'll look after Moni today. And ? Moni looks after me tomorrow. Isn't it nice to have them home again? The house did seem so empty without Mr. and Mrs. Bare. There you are, Simon. Come on. Drink it up. I won't have you making a will, Moni. I told you when we got married, there was no need. If you outlive me, you've got what I've got. If outlive you, I have what you've got. That's the law. It's Dora. She has no right to anything. She's a rich interfering busy body. I told Phillip how I felt about Dora. Listen, Moni. Next of kin. That's what you gotta be. It's simple. Leave it like that. Next of kin. I've got to take care of Dora. Keep the money in the family. He said it over and over again. Anyway, my ticker's worn up. I've told you before. You'll be here long after I'm dead and gone. Then you can leave it to a cat's home. Home. I got my way, Teddy. I made Phillip know I meant what I said. Must make a will. It's essential. Listen, Moni. Promise me you won't make a will. I'll phone up Phillip and tell him it's off, eh? It's too late. I can't, Teddy. It's done. I must look after my family, Teddy Bare. All the family I've got. Bringing it for me to sign. Tomorrow. Sorry about that, Moni. I'm sorry you did it. Really I am. Coffee in the drawing room, ma'am. Coffee, Teddy. That's right, dear. I do like good manners. And you never forget yours, do you? Well, I've got a good teacher. Don't forget yourself, dear. Keep up with Moni. I'll watch it. Teddy, get out the magic carpet. Let's go for a ride. Keep Moni awake. All right, mate. Where do you want to go to tonight, dear? Japan. Page 16. Japan for the blossoms, eh? Yes. The blossoms in Japan. Lovely blossoms. Would you like to marry again, sugar, Teddy? I'm satisfied. Well, I'll tell you where we'll go tonight. Bermuda. Look. There. Bermuda. Lovely. Come on, Moni. Drink up. Don't disappoint the boy. Finished your library book, Moni? Huh? The library book. I didn't like it. Silly. But you'll need another one tonight, won't you? Just let's leave Bermuda. It's sunny there. Go to Bermuda another night, Moni. I don't want to drag you up and down that hill again. It's only half past seven now. The library doesn't close till eight o'clock. That's quarter of an hour there. Ten minutes to choose your book. And quarter of an hour home. Home. - At home, dear. Oh, Emmie, Mrs. Bare is gonna have a nice little snooze. That's good, sir. That's what she needs. If Mrs. Bare wants you, she'll ring her bell, so don't you disturb her. Or I'll cut your tail off. I won't disturb her, sir. I should be upstairs finishing the linen cabinet. I'm just going down to the library, Emmie. I shan't be about an hour. Is Mrs. Bare all right? Yes, sir. I won't go in unless I hear her bell. Very well. Moni. Are you cold, dear? Cold? Yes, I'm cold, dear. I'm cold. My Teddy Bare. Winnie. Yes, and your tired, too, aren't you? Mmm. Tired and cold. Let's put on a fire, eh? Come on. That's a nice little warm. So you were the first to find her? What did you see, Miss Evans? Madame lying on the floor where she'd fallen. She'd managed to turn on the fire. But it wasn't lit. We found the matches she spilled all over the fireplace, didn't we, sir? Thank you, Miss Evans. Now you've heard Dr. Walker's evidence. And also his suggestion that the reason why Mrs. Bare fell Because she was drunk, sir. Well, she wasn't. She may have liked her glass. But no more than that, sir. I was the last to see her alive. Sir. She sat so peaceful, nodding in her chair. Do you know of any reason why Mrs. Bare should take her own life? No, sir. Madame was younger than me. She wouldn't have wanted to die, sir. She was always so happy since she married Mr. Bare, sir. Thank you, Miss Evans. Come on, Emmie. Come on. I'm sure that all of us here are of the opinion that Mr. Bare has nothing of which to reproach himself. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. You've heard the evidence given by Dr. Walker. And also Miss Evans. You spoke very well, Emmie. You remembered everything. Oh, yes. Mr. Bare went through it with me first, didn't you, sir? He didn't want me to be nervous. And I wasn't. I thought everyone was so kind. So long, Emmie. To the car. What do you intend to do now, Edward? I thought of going abroad. Rome, Paris or Nice. Interesting to see the world. I expect you to think it's ended very satisfactorily? Highly satisfactory. Very clear verdict. Accidental death. Of course, you know, Edward. It's a curious thing about a coroner's verdict. What? Well, it isn't final. What does that mean? If further information comes to light, the case can be reopened. Hello, Phillip. I didn't expect to see you again. I was rather worried about our talk this morning. So I thought I'd better clarify the position. Oh. Over this way. We all have our little quarrels. But any time I need a lawyer, I'll remember you. Well, thank you, Edward. But it's your own position, I mean. I think I ought to warn you that if you start traveling seriously, you may find funds a bit tight. What do you mean? Well, you see. It isn't as if you can touch the money ? ? yet. Toddle, Emmie. Toddle. Don't go, Emmie. You're mentioned in the will too. Will? Moni didn't make a will. Sit down, Emmie. Oh, go on. Sit down. You heard what he said. It's very simple, really. Mrs. Bare left this house to Edward. But all her money is left in trust to her sister, Mrs. Macintosh. You'll get it when she dies. And there's 200 pounds for you, Emmie. 200 pounds! What is it dated? Mrs. Bare made it just after you were married. Before you fuddled her mind with too much drink. You'll get yourself had up for defamation of character if you're not careful. Accusing me without proof. Of course, there's the bungalow. We put that in your name, didn't we? The bungalow? A wooden shack! Go on. Toddle. Emmie. Toddle. Go think about your good news. It isn't every day you become an heiress. Moni wanted to put me right, didn't she? She wanted to scratch that will. And make a new one. That's right, Edward. Oh, sorry, Moni. You poor old girl. You make me sick. I'll see you out, Phillip. Don't bother. Must get up with the visitors go. Phillip. - Yeah? That sister, Dora. Where exactly does she live? Kingston, Jamaica. Too far, Edward. Well, Emmie. Now that you got your 200 pounds. Where you gonna go? Go, sir? Mmm. When I left the house and move out? Move out, sir? What's going to happen to me? Oh, I don't know, Emmie. See, I can't afford to go on living here. Mrs. Bare left me very badly off. Oh, sir. You can stay until you can get another job. Another job, sir? Oh, dear. I couldn't look for another place. Not now, sir. I'm too old. I wonder who'd have you anyway? You're getting very slow. Yes. Still I get through the work just the same, sir. Yeah, well, I'm a poor man, Emmie. You'll have to go home. I am home. This is my home, sir. But I can't afford servants. But you can afford me, sir. I don't want any wages. On the level? I wondered if Mrs. Bare meant 200 pounds for wages. Well. Yes, perhaps she did, sir.. She may have thought it be easier than you paying me every week. Emmie, I believe you have hit it. Of course, if I thought she meant that, you could stay. Did she ever mention it to you? I don't really remember, sir. Perhaps she did. She did! Well, I'll take your word for it, Emmie. You can stay. Oh, thank you, sir. It's not for me to say, sir. But why don't you go away for a bit? Well, I'm not gonna find what I'm looking for here. That's dead certain. Very well. Polly. You know what that means, don't you? Yes, sir. "Polly, put the kettle on. " And you should have a cup of tea, the minute I can get it to boil, sir. Well, I slipped up that time, Moni. You wanted to look after me. I shall have to think again. One thing's certain though. Somebody's got to cut to pay my passage. Check, sir? No, not this moment. I'm waiting. Have you ordered? Just tea, please. Seems we have the place all to ourselves today. Seems true. I had to come in out of the sun. My skin's sensitive. Yeah, me too. Gives me a headache. Pigmentation, my doctor says it's due to. I've seen you here before. But, uh ? Today I thought you'd be swimming or something. Unlikely. Saltwater doesn't agree with my skin. Matter of fact, I don't know why I came here. I hate the seaside. But I was bored and couldn't think of anything else to do. That brought me here too. Really? Why not come over and be sociable? We can hate it together. All right. The fortunes brought us here. We see you every day at breakfast. Mmm, I'm glad to see you too. Pity we haven't got talking before. I generally make friends pretty easy. Well, I didn't like to intrude, you know. And I ? I noticed your wedding ring. Oh, that. One of the spoils of war, my lad. You don't want to take any notice of that. Oh? As a matter of fact, I'm a widow. Oh, really? Poor Albert. Buried him six months ago. Oh, I'm sorry. What was the matter with him? He was dead. Never mind me. I'm always very humorous. No, it wasn't that. It's just that, uh ? I had a recent bereavement myself. Oh, really? Yeah. My wife. Very sudden. Oh, well. Never mind. Best not to think about it. Would you care to dance? All right. How long are you staying down here, Mr. …? Bare. Edward Bare. I don't really know. I can please myself. Ah, nice. Well, I like to do the same, come to think of it. Pity you can't stay here at the place for a while. It is possible. For a few days. My fingers itch sometimes when I'm sitting at the bar. Have you been at that bar before? I started off as working barmaid. Ended up marrying the governor. And darn near running the place. Of course, I'm in private life now. Why'd you give it up? Well, it was a big place. And you need a man in the house that size. For the look of the thing, you know. Anyway, I'd had enough. I bet you got quite a good price for a business like that. Not bad. Better than going on working. Why should I spoil my hands if I can keep them lily-white, eh? I know a better place than this for dancing. But a lady can't very well go by herself. You fond of dancing? Hmm. Depends on who I'm dancing with. All right. We'll find a better place. I promise. You know I enjoyed the last few days. Have you? Hmm. Not looking forward to next week. I'm on my own. Aren't you going to Paris? Oh, I don't know. I can't seem to make up my mind. I wish I could find somewhere to settle down. I'm sick of living in hotels. Say, do you mind if we sit down? My feet are killing me. So I'm at bit of a loose end myself. My late wife was a great loss to me. I can't say the same for my poor Albert. Still. I mustn't grumble. It cut off pretty nicely. Leave me alone. You mustn't touch. Leave me alone. I know too much. While you stay around, I'll just play around. With love. Leave me alone. I won't be true. You should've known I'm not for you. Though I'm your heart's desire, Haven't you learned? Children who play with fire will always get burned. I want to offer you a cigarette. Oh, I don't smoke. I've got good white teeth. And I want to keep them that way. Hmm. Shall we dance? All right. Mrs. Jeffries, you are a woman of the world. I've got a problem on my mind. I'd like to ask your advice. What's her name? There's no her in this one. Let's go out and talk. Well? What is it? Well, it's like this, Mrs. Jeffries. I've got enough money to live on. More than enough. But I'm bored. And I'm lonely. Well, I could give you some advice. But you might not like it. If the truth hurts, I can take it. Look around. Go up the aisle again. Get married? Mmm. You're a fine one to give advice, Mrs. Jeffries. Why don't you take a leaf out of your own book? Well, to be perfectly honest. There have been several occasions where I very nearly have. Then I found out it was the moneybags they were after. And not the old bag herself. No. I wouldn't mind playing matrimony again. You look like a fine fellow to put down pound for pound. Of course, I was thinking of letting my place and going abroad. Oh, that's a good idea. Rent it furnished. Then you can do what you want. Ah, it's easier said than done, that. You see, I would like ? well, a stranger – going out in my late wife's belongings. Not unless I like the look of them. Do you like the look of me? Yes. You might make a very good tenant. Of course, I'd, uh ? have to look the property over first. And see if I liked it. Oh, of course. Get to know the place. That could be arranged. I never commit myself, Mr. Bare. Not until both parties have signed on the dotted line. Here we are. Welcome to Stoneley. Ah, you've done quite well for yourself, Mr. Bare. I mustn't grumble. Still, could do with a lick of paint. Well, it keeps the rain out. Oh, no, Mr. Bare. I didn't expect you back until tomorrow. Don't worry. It'll pass. This is the Emmie I told you about. Hello, Emmie. It's big. How many bedrooms you got? Six. And a couple in the attic where she roosts. I've brought her over to see the house. Could I have a cup of tea? Oh, yes. Yes, sir. Go on. Go on. Show the lady where to put her coat. Here. This way, lady. See you later. What are you doing? I came to see Emmie, Edward. I wanted to talk to her. Emmie? While I'm away? What about, Phillip? It takes a long time to clear up an estate, Edward. There are still outstanding problems. I think the answers to some of them are to be found in this house. And what's Emmie got to do with it? Emmie is a very simple soul. She's easily imposed upon. But someday she's going to say something. Something that will lead to the truth. The truth? What are you trying to prove, Phillip? Yes, you're flush with success now. You're full of confidence. But remember, Edward. I'm watching you all the time. The jury said it was accidental death. Yeah, you seem to know what I'm talking about. Ah. This is my lawyer Mr. Mortimer. Mrs. Jeffries. How do you do? How do you do, Mrs. Jeffries? Mrs. Jeffries and I were guests in the same hotel. I just brought her up here to have a look around the house. Oh, you've decided to let it then? Oh, I may do. Well, Phillip. You'll be wanting to get back to the office, won't you? So we won't hold you any longer. I forgot to tell you, sir. Mr. Mortimer is here. Yes. I'm just going, Emmie. Ah, thank you, sir. Oh, by the way, Emmie. I hear you opened a bank account. And you're withdrawing checks. That's right, sir. Mr. Bare showed me how to do it. What do you expect her to do with her money? Keep it in a stocking under her bed? But Mrs. Bare meant that money for your rainy day, I mean. When Emmie needs an umbrella, she's got me. Very nice, too. I wish I had an umbrella to keep the wet off me. All right, Emmie. Mr. Mortimer's read his little sermon. Go on, toddle. Quite the old-fashioned kid, isn't she? Oh. Ah, comfy! If you do decide to take this house, Mrs. Jeffries, make Edward get rid of that gas fire. Why? I haven't been here since the day of the funeral, Edward. Every time I look at that mat, I see Mrs Bare lying there. Over here? You mustn't get morbid, Phillip. I'm the one who has to live with these ghosts. What was she doing here? She had an accident. With the gas fire. I thought you said it was flu. I said nothing of the sort. I said she had the flu just before. Oh, was that it? So we're sitting in the morgue, really! Oh, excuse my joke. I always see the funny side. Fancy. Mmm-hmm. I hope I haven't said anything to upset you, Mrs. Jeffries. No, my Albert dropped dead in a saloon bar one night. And I was drawing beer the next. Business has to go on, you know. All right. I'm glad I haven't put you against the house, Mrs. Jeffries. I would like to say anything to spoil any plans Edward has made. Phillip's a great one to bring the truth out into the open. He's trying to warn you that I'm the town's biggest fortune hunter. Is he? Why is he doing that? I suppose it's about time you knew, Mrs. Jeffries. I married a rich woman, older than myself. And what's more, we managed to confound all the local skeptics by being very happy. And content. Very nice thing. I don't mind, Phillip. I always trust you to keep an eye on my affairs. You're so straightforward. Yes, I'm always looking out for you, Edward. Well, you see I don't trip up. That's what I pay you for. Well, goodbye, Mrs. Jeffries. - Bye-bye. I'm in the telephone book, if you should ever need me. Oh, I'll remember that. Oh, Phil. By the way, I've got some news for you. You're not my lawyer ? any longer. No, but I'm still Moni's. Poor old Phil. He's got to work for every bob he's got. I expect he finds it demoralizing. Oh, allow me. Tea, lady. Oh, good. Emmie, where's the little girl's room? Beg pardon? Left alone the first landing. Second door. Thanks.. Simple, isn't she? Well, Emmie. You know, that lady being here today has brought a lot back to me. I expect it has, sir. Were you surprised when you saw her? Well, sitting in madame's chair, I was, sir. Mrs. Jeffries... is a widow, Emmie. Oh. Such a sad life she had with her husband too. She believes every man's a monster. She ought to seen you and the mistress, sir. Ah. But that was a perfect union, Emmie. I wish Mrs. Jeffries could know about that. It might help her. Well. I think I'll go and pick her a rose. A rose? Oh, that's nice, sir. - Yes. You keep the place very well, Emmie. Even the rooms not in use. Thank you, ma'am. Tell me. Why is one of the doors locked? Oh, that was their room, ma'am. Mr. Bare locked it up. And it's never been used since. Oh, I see. This place is too big for one man. I suspect it was different when Mrs. Bare was alive. More lively. Oh, yes. He did everything for her. No woman ever had a better husband. And she was always the first to say so. It didn't matter how much he spent. He's lucky to have the money to spend. Oh, the money all came from the shop. Oh? Tell me about the shop, Emmie. Well, it's been in the family, you see. And it grew and grew. And then Mr. Bare sold it for her after they got married. They got such a lot of money. Oh, they did have an evening. They were so cheerful. I had a glass of port. How much will they have to be cheerful about, Emmie? Thousands and thousands of pounds. Quite a little gold mine, they called it. Well, Emmie. I see you've been letting your tongue run away with you. And I bet you forgot to tell Mrs. Jeffries where up is. Oh, dear. You're going to lose your head one of these days., Emmie, you really will. Go on, Emmie. Toddle. Toddle. She's been saying some very nice things about you, Mr. Bare. Oh, well, she's very loyal. Oh, I picked you a rose. Oh? Thanks. Will you be a moment? All right. Now then, sugar? No thanks. I'm on a diet. Oh really? Yeah. Why don't you stay at the ball down in the town for a bit? Milk? Oh. Thanks. After all, your time's your own, isn’t it? Mmm. That's true. And then if you like the place, you could move up here. On what terms, Mr. Bare? Any terms you like. Pound for pound, Mr. Bare? Pound for pound, Mrs. Jeffries. All right. - Good. Oh, I have something to put in this tea. Oh. What's the matter? I felt suddenly cold. Somebody walking over my grave, perhaps. You needn't worry about that, Mrs. Jeffries. They won't be burying you for a long time yet. Not if you're a good girl. Do you know my wife? - How are you? What about a toast, Charlie? Come on, Charlie boy. Come on, Charlie. You're his best man. Silence for Charlie Mann. Ladies and gentlemen, I didn't come here to talk? As Anthony said to Cleopatra when he went into her tent. All right. All right. I'll cut it short. All of us here today are friends of Teddy Bare. And we all shared the disorder when the late Mrs. Bare. So suddenly and so sadly passed on. And so it's a real pleasure to see him here amongst us a happy man once more. By his side, that charming lady he's introduced into our company. And whom we welcome as his wife. So, friends, it's a real pleasure to give you Mr. and Mrs. Edward Bare. Long may they thrive and prosper. Hear, hear! - Well done! Very nice, Charlie. This really is champagne. Who paid for it, Eddie? Not you, I suppose. No. I think I'm right in saying that the bride or the bride's parents paid for the wedding, Brinker. Pound for pound, Mr. Bare. Pound for pound? I believe you've met your match, Teddy. This stuff always makes me sick. Can I have a beer? Come on, honey. I'll get you one. You just have to know how to land them, Teddy. What bait do you use? Charm, Charlie. Just charm. Your charm or my money? Don't forget it was me that financed that little trip of yours to the seaside. Don't worry. You'll get your money back. I mean to. You've landed your fish now, Teddy. But don't forget it was your Uncle Charlie that supplied the chips. Well, glad to see you made friends with the vacuum. It didn't blow up after all, eh? No, ma'am. By the way, Emmie. Isn't it about time I paid you some wages? I've been here a month now. Oh, no! I've got my money in the bank. Madame left me 200 pounds. Well, that has nothing to do with me or Mr. Bare. That's separate. No, Mr. Bare explained. Madame left me my wages in a lump sum. Oh, Emmie! There's one born every minute. Never mind. I'll see you're not a loser. Come on, I want you to open this door. Oh, Mr. Bare will go raving mad. It's only opened up once a week for me to dust. From now on, Emmie, it isn't only what Mr. Blair wants. Come on. Open up. Well, I say. Well, anyone would think it's Bluebeard’s chamber. Blimey, it is. It hasn't been used since madame passed on. Mr. Bare like it kept locked up. All the same, it's silly to keep it shut up. Mr. Bare won't like it, ma'am. That's madame the day she married Mr. Bare. Oh, she had a kind face. Tell me, Emmie. How did she come to marry Mr. Bare? Oh, well, you see. Mr. Bare was a clerk in Mr. Mann's estate agency. He come up here when madame thought of selling the business. Took to him at once, madame did. Oh, he can certainly turn on the charm when he wants to. What's in here? We'll have to get rid of this lot. No sense in giving the moths a feast. What are you doing in here? Get out! Get out both of you! This is Moni's room. I told you never to unlock this door, didn't I. I told you! Stop it Ed! It wasn't Emmie's fault. It was mine. Anyway, why shouldn't the room be unlocked? Get out! Get out, I said! This is Moni's room. I don't want anyone in here. Well, carry on. All right, Ed. I'm sorry. I didn't know it meant that much to you. Go on. Get out. Never let me see you in that room again. I told you. You know, if he had any more wives, I'd of had to sleep in the bathroom. Well, I didn't expect to see you. Well, I was passing. I thought I'd wait for you. What have they done to you today? Oh, the usual. I want my hair gold. But then I thought it might make me look common. Here. Shove over. I want to drive. I'm sorry I blew up this morning in Moni's room. I haven't been sleeping well lately. I get a sort of shut-in feeling. Makes me irritable. What are you getting at, Ed? I don't want to disturb you again. I think I'll move into Moni's room. Stay there for a night or two. Listen, Ed. I don't know what your arrangement was with Moni. But I didn't marry you for companionship. Okay, Miss Bare. I bought you a present. Oh, crystallized fruits. Lovely. I seem to remember you saying you liked them. I know. Got all the tricks, haven't you, Ed? Still, they're nice tricks. I can't be cross with you for long. Well, I'm glad you came around. Don't like the sulks. You know, it is a lovely view, Ed! Mrs. Bare, I'm gonna pick you a little bouquet. To keep you happy. Oh, thank you kindly, sir. Come on. Come give us a hand. Is it safe? - Of course, it's safe. Charlie Mann is on a good thing, Freda. Who for? Charlie Mann? Oh, funny. No. A piece of land behind the cathedral. Chuck says it's ready to go for 3000. But I can get it for two. It's worth twice that amount in three years. Why? Gonna build a cinema on it. Who said? Charlie's got a cousin in the survey department. Well, you know your own business best, Ed. But I'd say your money was safer in the bank. We could do it in your name, if you like. I thought you'd like to hold the accounting. What sort of a fool do you take me for, Ed? A very wise woman, Mrs. Bare, who knows when she's onto a good thing. You're right there. I back my horses when they're past the post. This one's better. It's back home in the stable now. Not until that cinema is built, it isn't. And if you're so sure, why don't you write out your own check? Anyway, I've asked Charlie Mann to come up and see you tonight. I hope you're not gonna make a fool of me. Well then, you better put him off. I'm not gonna put him off, Mrs. Bare.. And I'm not gonna play, Ed. You'll do as I say, Mrs. Bare. You hit me, Ed. And I'll hit you back. Tit for tat. Pound for pound. Remember? I'm not making a present of 2000 quid to you or Charlie Mann or anybody else. My money is my own. And it stays that way. Get that into your head once and for all. If you could only see your face. Can we help? That's very kind of you. Ed, see what you can do. All right. The engine stalled. And I can't get it started again. That's all right. My name is Bare. That's my wife. We live just there. I am Charlotte Young. Sorry to disturb you. Oh, not at all. I like tinkering about with cars. You hop in the car. I'll take you up to the house while he's fixing it. Oh. Thank you. Are they making you quite comfortable at the Crown, Miss Young? Yes, very. So far. - Bed's clean? Quite. Thank you. Hot water hot? - I think so. Looks a good house, the Crown. You can always tell by the brass outside and the curtains. It sounds as if Ed has got your car going. The car is perfect. The carburetor got choked up. That's all. Oh, was that it? - It's always something small. But don't go. Don't go. Sit down. Have a drink. Sherry? - Oh, thank you. Miss Young is looking for a house around here, Ed. I told her you used to be in the estate business. Oh, yes. Yes, that's right. I'd say she dropped into the right place. Got some addresses ? at Manamead. Oh, Manamead. That's a very posh district. What sort of price were you thinking of? Twelve thousand. Something like that. Of course, they are converting a lot of these big houses into flats. I don't want a flat Oh, you're going to live in it? Yes. I'm going to start a school. An equestrian school. Eh? - Horses. Oh. I know a bit about horses. Yes. Quite the little jockey, aren't we, Ed? I ran around in school for some years. But I was in my own boss then. When my father died, I found myself independent. Very nice. So I gave them my notice. And went around the world. Very nice too. That's what I'd like to do. I don't think I'm taking a liberty, Miss Young. But what agency did you go to? Russell and Portland. Oh, they're dead from the neck up, aren't they? That's right. Very old-fashioned. You ought to see my friend Charlie Mann, Miss Young. Oh, should I? - Mmm-hmm. Why don't you let him take you in to see Charlie, Miss Young? Oh, I couldn't bother. Oh, it's no bother. My time's my own. I'm retired. He made his pile young. You'd be doing him a kindness, really. Are you sure? Miss Young is staying at Crown, Ed. All right. 10:30 tomorrow morning. Take you up to see Charlie Mann. And pick up the missus. Oh, thank you very much. And for the drink too. Sorry I have to go so soon. I brought your car around to the side. It's easier for you. You must come again, now that you know your way. After you, Miss Young. Oh, my bag. Oh, Miss Young's bag, Ed. - Oh, right. There you are. There's your bag, Miss Young. Oh, thank you. All right. - Well, goodbye, Mrs. Bare. Goodbye. Not for long, I hope. Nice woman. - Mmm. Pity she came too late. What? - You heard. You'll see Charlie this afternoon, Mrs. Bare, about that piece of land? I wouldn't entertain it. - But look here, Freda. Listen, Ed. A clever bird doesn't foul its own nest. I don't mind helping you pluck the one that's just fallen into your lap. But my feathers are in tight. And if anybody pulls them, I yell. You wouldn't have liked this one, Moni. She's crude. It's a lovely house. But it's hopelessly wrong for me. Yes, it's too big for you, Charlotte. What's the matter with you today, Edward? Is something wrong? Well, I'm afraid we've looked at our last house together. Oh, Edward, why? It's Mrs. Bare. She's beginning to get jealous of you, Charlotte. Well, I haven't noticed any change in her manner. No, no, you wouldn't. But she's a very neurotic woman altogether. She, um ? She keeps on threatening to commit suicide. I have to be very careful. But she seems such a practical person. Oh, I know you'd think so. She's talked about it so many time,. That sometimes I wish she would jump out a window. Oh, Edward! I didn't mean that, of course. But ? I've got to talk to someone. I mean, you can see my position. My first wife dies in a fearful accident. And ? My second commits suicide. Lovely. What a dreadful situation for both of you. Yes, I know. I can't leave her on her own, now that I know what's in her mind. And no one here to keep an eye on her. I'm sorry she feels this way about me. Oh, it needn't worry you, Charlotte. Well, I was just going to ask her if she would put me up for a few days. Stay with us, you mean? Yes, The hotel can't give me my room next week. Well, it doesn't matter now. There you are. Safe and sound. Thank you, Edward. You've been most kind. All right. Charlotte. You know, I've been thinking. I don't see why you shouldn't come stay with us? After all, our house is big enough. It would be a good deed for Mrs. Bare really. She would say there's nothing in her little fancies. Oh, do you really think so? Well, we could ask her. No, Edward. I'd rather not. Now look here, Charlotte. I'm still boss in my own home. Emmie! Is Mrs. Bare back from the dressmaker's yet? No, sir. She did say you were picking her up, sir. I never said any such thing. All right, Emmie. See what I mean? Every time I take you out, she invents a new story. Charlotte. Every time you come into this room, you go to the fireplace. And you look straight at the fire. Oh, I'm sure I don't. Every blessed time. Look at you now. Why? Because someone's told you about Moni? Well, I won't pretend I haven't heard gossip up at the hotel. Very dangerous. Gossip. What exactly have you been hearing? They say you taught her to drink. Why? So she could turn on the gas? Collapse before she could light it? Very clever crime, that. You have to have brains to think that one out. The way you say it, Edward, you would. No one could ever prove that you did it. You know, if it wasn't disgusting, it would be laughable. I'm surprised at you, Charlotte. Listening things like that. Well, people know I've come here. We've been seen together. Edward. They even asked me about the gas fire. And whether it's still here. Freda got rid of that. I suppose it fascinates them. The fire. The room. And everything. Why exactly are they interested? Well, I imagine... It's the idea of you going on living here in this room where your first wife died. And my second pours the tea. They don't understand me, Charlotte. But you do. Moni is dead, I know. But I've got a lot of very happy memories of her. This is Moni's chair. That one wanted to chuck it out. But ? I said no. I come down in the dark sometimes. Watching. Imagining her, seeing her there, talking to me. Was she cross with you, Edward? No, no. She… thinks I ought to have waited a bit longer. Mourned her a bit. But Moni understood me. She knew I was born to have color in my life. It ? This is my magic carpet. A picture postcard? - Hmm. Then around the world on these postcards. Moni and I. There wasn't the day I wished I'd get stuck with an album. You'd do anything to get on that magic carpet, wouldn't you, Edward? Would I, Charlotte? It's a wonderful thing. Fly away and leave everything behind. There's room for a passenger on this carpet. I thought of that. Ed! Ed! Where have you been? There I was. Standing for hours on the corner, in the heat and dust. My feet are killing me. Well, I don't have to ask which you been doing. And I know who you've been with. Morning, Miss Young. Found your stable yet? We did see a place. But Edward said it was too expensive. I'm glad he's being careful with somebody's money. Charlotte was saying she's getting fed up staying at hotels. Being on her own all the time. Oh? Yes. I wish I could find rooms with a family. Just until I get settled on a house, you know. It's a good idea, Freda. Ed, take this fish. I'll get some lunches. Cut! You were saying, Miss Young? That if I could find rooms in the house of some nice people, I pay very well. I'm sure you would. There must be some houses in the town with some very nice people in them. Oh, I'd be very little trouble. You see, I've been so lonely since I went out of harness. Well, Miss Young. You better decide on one of your fancy houses. And get your harness on again. Your friend's just going, Ed. Oh, not staying for lunch? There's plenty of halibut. But she told me in the future, Charlie Mann's going to show her the properties himself. I know where to find you, Charlotte, if I feel like morning coffee. There's lunch early at the Crown. Miss Young, I know you won't want to miss yours. Your bag. This way, Miss Young. Look, Mrs. Bare. I've been nice, Miss Young. But even the best of friends must part. Good morning. Emmie! Emmie! How did Mr. Bare tell you to cook that fish? He said grill it. - Fry it! Now then, young Ed. Don't blame me. I didn't ask her to fancy me. If she does, she wants her brains examined. Drop her, Ed. You've been talked about enough in this town. I don't want to drop her till she's bought that land behind the cathedral. Well what's in it for you if she does, Ed? Charlie will look after me. I'll tell you what we do. We split the spending money. You put down your check. I'll put mine beside it. I wouldn't mind putting down my check in the least. As long as it was presented. Would you mind explaining that remark, Ed? I couldn't write a check for 10 pounds. Let alone a thousand. What do you mean? You slipped up, Mrs. Bare. You should've checked up at Somerset House like I did. Your Albert did everything nice and simple. I shan't cut out so well when I go. Come on. Out with it. What did Moni leave you? Not a sausage. It all went to that sister Dora in Kingston, Jamaica. All I got was this house and that shack on the beach. Remember? Lovely on a warm day. Of course, Moni gave me a check occasionally. But uh ? I spent my stocking ? catching you. Well, Mrs. Bare, I must say, you certainly can take it. Well it's either laugh or cry, Ed. I was never one for tears. I know why you've been making up to Charlotte Young. She's a plumper bird than I am. I'm not having it, Ed. You may not be much of a catch. But ? So help me, I love you. We didn't expect that, did we? You're not seeing that woman again. Don't be silly, Freda. I'm bound to see her again in a place this size. Well, there's a bungalow. We can go there. Give her a chance to vamoose out of the place. And leave Emmie? We'll take Emmie with us. You have the car around here by five. I'll get her to pack. I can't be ready by five. No arguments, Ed. We're doing as I say. And we're staying away until she's gone. And don't go phoning her, Ed. Make it a clean break. Emmie! Emmie. This one's dead easy, Moni. Oh, Emmie, for goodness sakes, stop sniveling. I will not be crossed. You're coming. And that's all there is to it. Freda! Freda! Shut up, Emmie! What? Just going out to get a paper. All right. Well, don't be long. Now back up, Emmie. You ought to be pleased. Going away for a nice holiday like this. I can't sleep in a strange bed. How do you know if you've never been in one? I don't like the sea. Well, you don't have to drink it. It's not safe to leave the house. Burglars ? Now look. Mr. Bare will ring the police to tell them we're going away. They'll put a policeman outside. Now nobody can get past a policeman. Hello? Hello. Are you Wood Oak 72? Yes. That's right. Is Mr. Edward Bare there? Who? Speak up please. I can't hear you very well. Mr. Edward Bare. It's Mr. Mortimer's office. Oh, he's not here. He just went out for a minute. Will you have them phone us as soon as he comes in, please. All right. Goodbye. Now then, Emmie. Let's get a move on. When madame took me to Canterbury, I was sick all over the car. Well, you're older and wiser now. And your stomachs a lot stronger. It's all such a rush. I've made up my mind, Emmie. So it's no use you going on nattering. The car is below. Where is, Emmie? Oh, she's got some silly idea she doesn't want to come. Well, if the poor girl doesn't want to come, let her stay. She's coming. You are pigheaded, Freda. I always knew that about you. Ready, Emmie? The record for the Mr. Bird is missing. Oh no, I forgot. Mr. Mortimer phoned. He wants to see you. What about? I don't know. Some mumbling clot with a cold got through. I said you'd ring him back later. Oh, forget it. No no no. You better do it. It might be important. Now Emmie, stop looking like a wet wig. Pick up your bag. And come on. The bird's so afraid, his poor little heart can't sing. Woodyoak 68. Mr. Mortimer? Mr. Bare. Well, will you tell him it's very inconvenient. But I'll be there. Yes, without fail. Right. Oh, she's a stubborn ? What are you take your coat off for? We're not going. What? - I've got to see Phillip Mortimer. When? - Tonight, nine o'clock. Well, what does he want all of a sudden? I don't know. Said it was urgent. He said he had a letter from Mrs. Maclntosh. That's Moni's sister, Dora. I shall have to wait and see. You better get Emmie out of the car. Get Emmie out of the car? If you knew what I went through getting her into it! Well, she can't sit out there till after nine o'clock! Well, who's sitting anyway to left at nine o'clock? We're off. Without me? You catch the 10.05. I'll meet you at the station. Look, I'll tell you what. I'll phone Phillip and put him off. No. Ed. Better wait here and get it cleared up. Whatever it is. I don't want you running backwards and forwards holding Miss Young's hand. That's why were going away. To stop all that. All right. I won't argue, Mrs. Bare. I'll see you tonight. - Go ahead. Oh, what about the shams? Oh, leave them. They suit the place. Well, there you go, Mrs. Bare. Gently does it. Be careful, Miss Bare. Gently does it. The rest is easy. It's a push-over, Moni. Mrs. Bare? Mrs. Bare? You left your bag in the car again. Where is Mrs. Bare.? She's all right now. Come in here first. Where is she? Well, we had a total row, just after you left this morning. What happened? You sounded desperate on the telephone. She is hysterical. Blind hysterical. It's good to have a friend to call on, Charlotte. I've got so much on my mind. Do sit down. I've had Moni on my mind lately too. Do sit down. I ? I've got to unload to someone. It's been an incomprehensible day. How, Edward? I had a sort of premonition. Of what? Someone's gonna die. Where is Mrs. Bare? Oh, she's all right. I'm the one you gotta worry about. Do sit down. I got to talk to someone. Or bust. Someone who won't talk about it afterwards. Surely, you can trust me, Edward. Well, uh. Where shall I begin? It's always best to start at the beginning. It was the first time I ever came to this house. It wasn't until I moved in for good though. See, I gave her value for money. I made her laugh. Taught her to appreciate a fine old brandy. I gave her something to live for. Me. And the drink. But it ? uh – caught up with her in the end. If Moni hadn't gotten drunk and misled me, I ? When did she mislead you? That last day. She kept talking about a will and Dora. I thought she was going to bring her sister back into the picture. But instead, she was going to cut her out altogether. If Moni had made herself clear, she'd be alive today. Edward. Do you know what you're saying? Of course I know what I'm saying. I'm saying I killed your sister. Dora! This window. You see this catch? Moni had a phobia about burglars. And had this comic lock fitted. She taught me how to use it. And I had to teach Freda. But you kick that latch open. And went straight through the first time. "Where do I powder my nose?" you said. Second on the right, I said. And you turn to the left, where it is! You cheapened yourself by pretending to fall in love with me. Well, I know who I appeal to. And who I don't. Freda because she's my class. And Moni because she was old and lonely. What did you come here for? What good did you think it would do? I wasn't satisfied with the result of the inquest. I've come here to put you where you can't harm anyone else. And who do you think would believe you? Anybody would laugh in your face. You're not worth bothering about. Get back to Jamaica where you came from! What are you listening for? Mrs. Bare. Where is Mrs. Bare? Have you killed her too? Find her. Mrs. Bare! Search the house! Dig up the cellars! She's gone! She's left! You'll never see her again! Where is she? What have you done with her? Out of my way. Or I'll call the police! Tell the police. Tell them the killer is off his senses. Send them to come and get me. I'll have a drink while I'm waiting. What are you waiting for? It's not like you, Edward. Just calm and telling me to go. There's something else at the back of that black mind of yours. And I'm going to stay here until I find out what it is. Get out of this house! No. Get out of this house! No. All the time I'm here, I'm safe. You can't afford another dead body in your drawing room, Edward. All right, Dora. You're asking for the fireworks. And here they come. You come one step nearer and I'll scream this place down. Yes but only once. You should study human nature. If the chap here's a screen. Listens. Doesn't hear another, he walks on again. Take care, Edward. I'm much tougher than I look. If you're tougher than you look, why are you so frightened of me? It's all right. I was only going to finish my drink. Argh! This was where your sister sat for the last time. Go on. I'll give you one more chance. Clear out while it's still your word against mine. You can't frighten me, Edward. The game is up. I phoned Phillip Mortimer. I could've saved you the trouble. He's always in Canterbury on a Friday. I expect you left a message. It'll be a sweet thought when he finds your body were right intend to dump it. It's not normal to have as much confidence as you have. I wonder what you'd be like without it? Go on. Get out! Run! I'm not going to run because you want me to. And I'm not going to die because you want me to. GET OUT! I've been to Rumford, Edward. And Acton. I met your schoolmaster. The one you hated so. I talked to him. And now I know what an unbalanced mess you really are. Rumford? Shut up. And Acton. I talked to the small boy who lived next door to you. The one you tried to kill. And very nearly did. I didn't try to kill him. That boy is grown up now. And I know what really happened. What a pity this didn't come out at the inquest. Shut up. I won't listen! Oh, yes, you will! I'm going to show you to yourself as you really are! Drag out your rottenness. And make you look at it! Shut up, shut up, shut up! Look at you! Even if you escape the law, which is unlikely, You can never escape… - Escape myself. I know it all. There's not a doctor I can't beat at his own game. I've had this whole psych routine for years and years and years. And there is not one official mark against me, Dora. Which is one reason why I can kill you now. Well, hit me, Edward, hit me! Now, when I'm nothing but prints on the poker! Blood on the carpet. Or are you going to carry me out without being seen? This is not how you mean to do it, Edward. You're bluffing again. Trying to make me run. Well, I'm not going to run! I'm staying here where l… GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT! I've come across the world to see you like this, Edward. And now I know you won't go free. All right, Emmie. All right. Now you go on up to bed. You'll feel better in the morning. I'm ever so sorry, ma'am. No, it was my fault, Emmie. Now go on. I'll come up and see you in a minute. Oh. Well, her stomach isn't any stronger. We stopped to have tea. And instead, she nearly passed out. You again, Miss Young? Funny sort of time to be visiting my house while I'm away. I am not Charlotte Young. My name is Dora Maclntosh. Your husband Edward killed my sister. Well, I've had some pretty funny welcomes in my time. But this about just takes the cake. It's true. It's true. He's a murderer. Well, he looks very well on it. Come on, Miss Young. I know Edward's a bad boy. But he isn't as bad as all that. I must phone the police. Not from here you don't! Oh, please, let me use the telephone. I can't leave you with him. It's not safe. That's for me to decide. Now will you kindly get out of my house? Your bag, Miss Young. Now then, young Ed. I want an explanation. What's the game, Ed? I won. Oh, I shall always laugh when I think of it. I couldn't get her to go. I tried every way. And then she went like a lamp ? for you. I don't know what you're talking about. She'll go over Sunrise Hill just like a bird. Down down down into the valley. I don't know what you're saying. My God, you haven't touched her car? I touched her car all right. Hydraulic brakes snipped. I cut the tube. The oil will run out. She's in a hurry. She couldn't stop. No, Miss Young! You don't know what you've done. I know what I've done. I've got my money. Any questions, Miss Bare.? I don't mind you knowing everything. After all, a wife can't be compelled to give evidence against her husband. Can she? I don't want to know any more. But I've got to make sure you don't stick. Haven't I? I don't want you hanging around my neck now that I've got Moni's money. Listen. I killed Moni. And I killed her sister. I'm a ruthless cold-blooded killer. And I did it for gain. What's the matter, Phillip? Been an accident? Something that was thought to be an accident, Edward. But it was a murder. I'm going to phone the police. Freda, you tell ? How long have they been here, Freda? Long enough. Mr. Mortimer stopped me in the drive. I'm dreaming. You'll wake up in prison, Edward. Broadmoor, if you're lucky. Broadmoor? Moni! Moni, tell me what to do! I didn't mean it, Moni. I didn't! Pull yourself together, Ed. Mr. Mortimer, give him a drink. Ed! Ed! My brain is still working, Freda. Thanks. Phillip! Edward! I've done it, Moni. I've done it! Sorry, Mrs. Bare. The only time in my life my heart ruled my head. Emmie. Emmie. Emmie. Emmie!
