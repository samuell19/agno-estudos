Courtesy of Visva-Bharati University Sound Rerecording SATYEN CHATTERJEE Musical Direction JYOTIRINDRA MOITRA Written, Produced, and Directed by RITWIK GHATAK Young lady! - Yes? - Come here. Tell your father he'll soon owe for two months. This can't go on! - I'll tell him. - You do that. Again? Just this once, Bansi. I’ve just got to shave. You and your father are shaving me clean! Any idea how much you owe? Just one blade. “Dark-skinned girl”? What does it mean? That her pigment is a bit dark? Goodness me! Stop going on! Go teach! You don't get my point! What if she suddenly returns after tutoring? She'll be hurt if she hears this. Such a responsible girl! Pursuing her M.A., tutoring two students, and bringing in 40 rupees a month - Are you still rattling on? You talk and talk but don't really care to know. I heard at the committee meeting they'll be starting evictions again and cutting off money for the school. Shall I bring a cushion so you can ramble on? Goodness me! Goodness me! Your sandals are broken! I'll get a new pair. Goodness me! Sir, your contribution for our refugee camp? I'm glad I ran into you. You're involved in theater. That's wonderful. The tragic theme of your play is a noble one, but why must we be kept awake at night by all the racket? The bee flies buzzing into the room What news does it bring? Neeta! What? Stop destroying that bolster! You're late for college! Go! I’m going! Hey there. A love letter at your advanced age? Give it back! Let me read it! “When we first met, I didn't really see you. I thought you quite ordinary. Now I can see... you're a cloud-capped star, veiled by circumstance, your brilliance dimmed by a clouded sky...” What tripe! Let me see the name! “Sanat”? That idiot? I haven't seen him around in a while. Poking your nose into a girl's personal affairs! “Personal”? If you're a person, someday I'll be a genius! You know you are one. That's why you're so arrogant. If only Bansi the grocer understood that I'm a genius. How about some money? My beard is itching bad. - How much? - Two annas for now. Or maybe four. Or maybe eight. I'll buy some flavored tobacco. Why not a whole tenner? You got paid today, right? Why don't you get a job? That's unseemly for an artiste. Another two years... and money will be raining down from the sky. You know what Amir Khan gets for a single performance? Remember what I said about the tenner! Ma, you know Manasi from my college, the dark-skinned girl? She has a sari with milkmaids on it. Not that again! Don't listen to her! Tomorrow's our final soccer match. The other team has cleats now. I can't wear this same ugly sari every day. Her Highness has been in the same class for three years now. Why even bother? I mus! have shoes with cleats by tomorrow! It's hard just providing two meals a day, yet the demands never stop. By month's end it's one dish per meal... It's the first of the month! Neeta got paid! Neeta! - No, me first! These spikes are great! See how light they are? You didn't buy your sandals? Later. I got material for brother's shirt instead. - Guess who I just spotted. - Who? I recognized him at once, even after all these years. - It's Sanat, Father's student! - Should I call him? Hey, Sanat! Don't you recognize us? Montu? What are you staring at? You've changed these last few years. You were just a little girl... - And now...? - Neeta. Your letters keep coming, but you never visit. Why? I haven't forgotten your handwriting. I pass your letters on to Neeta. She's hardly at home, what with college and tutoring. We should head home. Ma will be angry. Why don't you come too? Montu, come on. - Coming. Geeta's grown up to be a lovely girl. Very lovely. Too bad she can't have decent clothes. - Neeta. - Yes? I must photograph my diagrams this month. I need some money. This month's money is all gone. I can't ever give my siblings the things they want. And I still come to you with my woes! I feel so powerless. This is your struggle. Can't I share it with you? I'll find a way to give you a bit next month. But do come by one day. Father's always talking about you. I'll do that the moment I have some money. Good-bye. She spent it all! Stop that! Your darling daughter is always throwing money away! It's her own money! The brazen hussy! She just runs around squandering money, enough for a whole month's groceries. I should be contributing more. How can I say anything? No one sees what I go through. No one understands. Such ingratitude! Ingrates, every one of you! Aren't you going to eat? I’m not feeling well. Listen... don't be angry with Ma. The weight of poverty has crushed her soul. I’m not angry. Remember that poem by Yeats? “Sing on: somewhere at some new moon we shall learn that sleeping is not death... hearing the whole earth change its tune.” My head's pounding. Goodness me! Here's another good-for-nothing lout! Our saint among sinners. What's this long hair? Cut it off! Nice material you bought! You definitely have good taste. Going to bed already? No dinner? - No. - Why not? Ma must have said something. Let people talk. You do what you want. Make that your motto. Leave me alone. What's this? Eyes full of tears? Ready to spill over at the slightest provocation. Very well. I'll cast a spell. All right? I don't feel good. Then I'll say a prayer. “Mother, your little girl wants to catch the moon. She says 'Ganush' for 'Ganesh.' She doesn't understand a thing. Your little girl is such a child!” Come on, get up. Don't forget: I need a tenner tomorrow. There's nothing left. You spent it all? Next month, then. Starting next month it all goes straight to Ma. Idiot! Whoever gives their money away is a full-scale idiot! Look at that ninny. Going somewhere this late all decked out? I couldn't wait till morning. I just had to see how I look. Slightly bovine. There's pleasure in practice. Bansi. Not now. I'm very busy. Send our bill for last month. You're going to pay UP? Anything else you'd like? Some soap? Just the bill. Very well. Geeta? Aren't you going to class? All these novels and movies when you're failing in school! There's never anything in this hell-hole of poverty! Then why not create a little paradise here? You can all parade around like angels, while I lie back twiddling my thumbs and smelling the celestial roses! Neeta, we need you desperately. You and Shankar have to sing at our function. I’ve given up singing, and Shankar's maestro won't give him permission. We at least have to discuss whom to invite and other plans. Fine. I'll stop by the library. Shanti, seems your rehearsals are going well. We're in a real fix. We need a good stage manager. You need no such thing! It's a terrible situation you've created as it is! Goodness me! - Ma. - What? My tutoring pay. All of it? I asked Bansi to send his bill. I always have to endure his scolding. Neeta. You keep five rupees. Pocket money. Have you no shame, sponging off your father? Your sister works all day long to pay your bills while you sing and toss your locks around! For money, Mother, for money! I'll be earning money too. I’ve been getting lots of inquiries since that radio audition. My maestro is furious! He'll let me perform after two more years of solid practice. Isn't he the one with the hennaed beard? Why not just hang on like a midget and swing from that? What able-bodied son sits at home? Go set up a shop! - I’m an artiste. - Quiet! My bread doesn't come cheap. I can't look your sisters in the face. No more free meals! If you want to eat, you can pay! Running off without eating? Did you tell Ma I'm taking advantage here? “Ma, your little boy doesn't understand a thing. Your little boy is such a child.” Cut it out. Why pay attention to nonsense? Why ruin your whole future over a few words today? Just grit your teeth for two more years. Here's something for now. Neeta, you're the only one who really appreciates me. In your hurry did you forget about tomorrow? What's tomorrow? Jagatdhatri Puja. So it's your birthday! Father's taking me out like in the old days. He is? Where? It's not decided yet. Somewhere. Then I'm coming too. But I know he'll make an awful face and say - - You're such a child! - I won't listen to him. I know he'll say no. Come on, let's eat. Why did you bring us here? Come along. Sunrise. Give me that. Didn't Keats have a verse... “The poetry of the earth is never dead.” These rice fields - it costs nothing to admire their beauty. So what if we have no money? These fields are here. Want to know the truth? Living is an art. You'll get indigestion. At the rate you're going - Look at our lives - Will you be a glutton all your life? Ignorant lad! You mustn't say such things. Couldn't we have a bit...? Here. Neeta, you think there's some water around? I think there's water nearby. Don't you? Sir? Your contribution is three months overdue. Please give us at least something. Come by tomorrow. I'll see what I can do. - Tomorrow morning? - Yes. Listen. I don't hear your voice in all the rehearsal mayhem. What are you up to? I quit. I wasn't getting any roles. Roles? As in acting? You're an actor? Sir. Who are you? Sanat, sir. Sanat! Didn't you place second in pure physics this year? Yes, sir. Who told me that? Ah, it was Neeta. Yes, we run into each other sometimes. I didn't even know you had relocated here. Ma'am, what's happened? You look so pale and gaunt. I'll make some tea. What are your plans now? I’m looking for a scholarship to do doctoral research. Monkey! A Doctor of Science? - Yes. PhD's are all too common. Swine! What's your thesis on? The Reynolds number of the supersonic vibration of the lower Gangetic plain. - Ape! - What? Not you. I mean Shankar. I was comparing you two. He's done nothing with his life. Son, come have a bite. - Go on. - Yes, sir. You're here? Immersed in your studies? There's no other way forward in life. What a beautiful spot! Who are these two? Geeta. I have no time. Take some tea to Sanat. Sanat's here? Wicked girl! What are you staring at? Take it! I’m late. How can you sit indoors all evening? I’d suffocate! See you later. Drink your tea. I can be late for tutoring since you've come by. Let's go for a walk. What's the matter? - Huh? - Anything wrong? - No. Let's go for a walk. I just suggested that. Miles away, weren't you? Hello? Anyone home? Where is everyone? - Out! Anyone home? You just walk in here? Get out this minute! Miserable wretch! Sauntering in here in broad daylight! Goodness me! Swami, how are you? The nerve! Come in. Wife, this is the famous swami I told you about. - When? - I'll be going. Bringing home vagabonds when you can't feed yourself! The beginnings always a bit troublesome, sir. Dean" he has a beautiful voice. You'll be spellbound. If you ever bring home another scoundrel...! Wait outside! I'll be right there! - Neeta? - Yes, Father? Quick, bring me a rupee. Swami? Not a word to your mother. Sanat, I'm busy now. I have some tutoring to do in Selimpur. Let's go. Ma, we're going for a walk, and I have tutoring after that. - Good-bye, ma'am. - Good-bye, son. I’d better tell you: I can't manage without a job. No, you have to do your research. But I can't seem to get a scholarship. I had to interrupt my regular studies. It's created an awful situation. Just a few more months. And then? I'll graduate... and get a job. And with your earnings I'm to - We could remove that distance between us by then. Your talent is so great. Remember that picture in my room? - The two kids? My big brother and me. We'd gone hiking in the hills that morning. We got up before dawn to see sunrise from the peak. What a strenuous climb! But when the sun came up... I just can't explain. Shankar would tease me... “Your little girl wants to catch the moon.” He still teases me. - You don't deserve any of this. - Of what? This hardship, suffering, and responsibility. Then make a glass case and place me inside like a wax doll. I'll be late for tutoring. Shall we? Neeta? This is why I come to you. You make all my troubles vanish. No cause for alarm. It's just a bone fracture. Neeta, come outside. An injury like that at his age will take a long time to heal. It looks like you'll have to run the household now. I'll go get medicine for an injection. He'll sleep till morning. See you later. I'll be back. Neeta? Weren't you working toward an M.A. this year? I couldn't continue. I had to get a job. See you. Better come up with a new line about your rent. I told you yesterday - “You'll get it when I do.” That line's stale. Are we your parents now... that you can just ride on our shoulders? Get a job! Settle down in life. You'll never understand that there's something called “an ideal”... something one suffers for. Your friend Saroj came by. I asked him about these things I can't understand. Mukundo? Come here. What did he say? - National Chemical. - One. - Joy Engineering. - Two. - Jagat Hosiery. - Three. Three jobs await, and you're studying hot air? If only you could live on hot air! The young lady is here Show her in. Your ideal has arrived. - I’m dying of thirst. - Hold on. Here. I'll take it. I’ve been running around for days. Luckily I found a job. Things are bad since Father's accident. I don't like this one bit. Why did you quit your studies? What else could I do? So many people at home... all counting on me. Walk me to the station? Let's go. Hail, Mother Tarry no longer Bless me with the virtues I crave Neeta! Let me have four annas. I need a shave! Hey, why make me run after you? Sorry. Knowledge Virtue of the goddess Saraswati Mother of the world Neeta, I couldn't bear doing research while you work. I'll get a job. You go back to school. I can easily find work. But... what about our wedding? It can't happen now. Why not? How can it? If I leave home now... my father, my little brother, my sister - Shankar is a rascal! That's his responsibility. You just don't understand him. He'll be great one day. You'll see. Just as you'll be great. I’m pinning my hopes on the two of you. And then maybe my time will come. So you mean, until then... We have to wait. Why should we? Don't be foolish. - Neeta. - Yes? I'll come by in a day or two. - All right. - I have a question to ask. A question? Then come by. - Bansi? - Need to shave? Here. How can I say no to the great artist? You're a singer. You have to shave. But have you shaved off all shame too? Shame? Your whole family living off your sister's labor and destroying her future. The whole camp is talking about it! Aren't you the oldest brother? Just because you give me blades on credit doesn't mean - Come off it! I call Neeta “Sinbad the sailor,” and you're like the old man riding on Sinbad's shoulders. Only death will set her free. Only death will set her free! Shame on you! I wasted all my good days Now, in bad times I've come to the river's edge Boatman, I don't know your name Who shall I call out to? Oh my heart, who will take you across? There is a boat but no boatman There is no one on the river bank Sir, I finished the lesson. I finished. It's getting late. Run along now. Montu's skipped classes for a month now. I heard today that he's failing. You hear me? He's been struck from the rolls because he can't pay the fees. What use is college to him anyway? It's a good thing that girl has a job. Just as well, isn't it? Father, did you hear about Montu? Stop being the bearer of bad news! Everyone knows! They also know you're happiest when this family's in trouble. So what if he's failed? What about you and that young man? Woman! Father... a factory hired him last month so he could be on their soccer team. He was too scared to tell you. He brought home his first pay. Everything's kept secret from me as if I were the enemy! Like father, like children! I’m not touching that money! You can run the household and face the music. Come along! A factory job? Labor? What's it matter? Those jobs offer better prospects these days. Just look what the middle classes have sunk to! Help me into the next room. Boatman, I don 't know your name... You all think I'm just an old nag, always finding fault. These last ten years have taken a heavy toll on my mind and spirit. It's like I'm not the same person. Ma, you needn't explain. I can't bear the load of this household anymore. You have to set me free. If Shankar were a real man, you wouldn't have such a load to carry. Brother is a good man. Really? And don't count on your Father anymore. He might stand and walk again someday... but it's like his mind is getting confused. It's true! He'll never earn a salary again. I’ve known him since I was seven. Don't worry, Ma. I’m here. I do worry! You have your own hopes and dreams... and who knows what else. In any case... without you I have nothing. I still can't put my mind at ease. The truth 'vs... you're my sole support. But at the same time you frighten me. My own daughter, yet so distant from me. If you leave too... Ma! I’ve never understood you. Why so quiet? I don't want to interrupt. - What is it? - Come eat. It's late. - You haven't eaten yet? - No. Why not? Because you haven't. Idiot. Neeta? I’m always taking advantage of you, aren't I? Don't start with that. I mean it. Your whole future... your chance at marriage... People are starting to talk. - Is your male pride hurt? - Idiot! - No male pride? - No. I have something far bigger: my music. Right now I'm exploiting you... but honestly... deep down it bothers me. Seriously? Yes, seriously. Listen to me. I love all of you madly. You all feel the same way. You're just too shy to admit it. And if someone else loves me... truly loves me... he'll wait for me. I have no fear about that. I won't get married right now. When you become famous... then I'll marry. I can wait that long, can't I? And then... all my suffering will vanish. Just don't you vanish too. Will you take me to the hills then? In those rolling, wide-open spaces, we'll run and frolic. Yes, I'll take you. You really are such a child. Banish sadness and poverty Bring happiness to all Adarang makes this plea Hear him O Supreme Being You are called the merciful one What are you staring at? You look awful. - Don't fall. - What's that? I’m using English like Father now. I said don't fall. What took you so long to come by? I just couldn't make it. What was that question you wanted to ask? There's no need now. Stay a while. I'll be back. I have a student to tutor. Ma, shall I take him some tea? Who? Some tea...? Go on. He's sitting all alone. Shall I chat with him a bit? Or take him out for a stroll? Do whatever you like. You can close your mouth now. Have some. Let's go for a stroll by the lake. Neeta won't be back for a while. Let's go. Leave that. Shall we? O firefly Man has no pity for you You say such silly things. You make me laugh. Why? What's so silly? You have a beautiful voice. I’ve kept putting them off. My friend's in management there. Don't be foolish. If it's a good job, take it. Leave those lodgings, get an apartment, and find a nice girl. We'll see... Keep staring like that... and you'll stare your whole life away! Do not wake me, my love Or I shall curse you I shall curse you Do not wake me from my sleep My beloved, I will curse you Those are my slippers! Take them off! - I just borrowed them. Why? You have two pairs. You got them muddy! Take them off! I can't wear mine anymore. I had to go to an event with my maestro. Get a job and buy your own! Take them off! Montu... could you spare a little something? - What? - Eight annas. No, four. I can't keep asking Neeta. My hair's gotten so long. If you're a beggar, you should live like one. Here. Shankar, go to your room. Come sit down. A whole tenner! Are your feelings hurt? He's my little brother! I’ve raised you all since you were little kids. Let him talk. Get some clothes made. Get a haircut and look decent. And buy some sandals. Careful! You have a dark future ahead. Suffer for others and there'll be no end to your suffering. Now sit. Brother! Idiot! You're a complete idiot! No. In the words of Bansi the grocer... you're Sinbad the Sailor. How else could a fool like me make a fool of you? What kind of boy is that Sanat? Why? The boy has no principles. I must have shrimp today. Where does all the money go? Your salary, your tutoring, Montu's salary - admit you can't manage. - Then why don't you do it? ”The best housewife has no house, and the most beautiful woman has no husband.” Neeta, my Pay. Just 50? I paid a month in advance at the factory dorm. That's right. He's decided to stay in the factory dorm from now on. - You're leaving home? - No, it's just a long way. And to play on their team, I need to eat well and keep fit. If you'd said something, we could have - No, it wouldn't work. But I'll come give you whatever I can spare. A young man has his needs! While his elders just sit at home and eat! Shankar, go do the shopping. By the way... I saw Sanat at our head office today. He took a job in supplies. Imagine! A science student! What's his salary? Over 300 at least. Not bad! The boss is his buddy. He has it made. Sanat's not here. He moved out last month. Ah, it's you! You want Sanat's address? I'll write it down. Give me your pen. - Just give it back. - I will. I took a job. You're going? Have you given any thought to getting Geeta married? I'll consider that once Neeta is married. One must think serially. - Neeta! You educated her, so now she's running the household! She can't marry now! Finding a groom for a working girl is less difficult. So marry her off, then sit and twiddle your thumbs. If she leaves, what will happen to this household? So we should continue to exploit her for our own survival? What will you eat? - Where have you been? - Out for a stroll. - You have exams soon. - They don't matter now. Then what does? I’m getting married. To whom? Does Ma know? Sanat. No use running dramatically out of the room. Not everyone's the patient type. You should learn that. Any news of Montu? He's playing a match in Delhi. Listen... Geeta asked about your earrings and bangles. You know how she is. She can take them. She needs them more than me. You know... what I mean is... this isn't how I wanted it! - How much yogurt should I order? - Whatever you think. Here's the list of names. Have a look. People used to marry a daughter off to a dying man. They were barbarians. But now we're educated and civilized. So we educate her to wring her dry and destroy her future! That's the difference. Oh dear, it's almost evening! I'll bring you some tea. Who wants tea? Who's this little one? Did no one give you any sweets? Childhood seems so far away. As for those hills... they no longer seem part of this world. No one climbs hills anymore. They're all headed straight to hell. Neeta... I got a job in a music school. Don't tell Ma. Get your M.A. I'll make the arrangements. Shankar... will you teach me one of Tagore's songs? What's that look? I sang when I was a kid. It's soft-hearted idiots like you who get hurt the worst! Fine! Then make a glass case... and place me inside like a wax doll. Listen to me! I’m... leaving this house. Even though I'm just a useless nobody here... I can't take it anymore. I’m leaving in protest. You can go on suffering silently... and get crushed to death! You want to learn a song? I have to sing at the wedding, don't I? That night when the storm blew down my door Little did I know you had entered my abode That night when the storm blew down my door Everything went dark The lamp was blown out I stretched my uncertain hands skyward Little did I know you had entered my abode That night when the storm blew down my door I lay in the dark as in a dream How could I know the storm was your victory banner? When morning came I saw you standing there In the void That enveloped my abode Little did I know you had entered my abode Neeta? Aren't you going to work? I don't feel well. I have a fever. You don't come to the library anymore. I'll stop by. Who's there? Who's there? - W's me, Father. It's a letter from Montu's factory. What's it say? There's no end to work. The day just slips away. What is it? What's happened? Let me see. “Last night on the night shift, Montu -” He's not dead! He's just injured! The machine didn't devour him completely. This was expected! I’m going to the hospital. Don't worry. This was expected. It had to happen. The doctor says he'll need a blood transfusion. Is that expensive? Yes. Make arrangements by tomorrow. The crisis isn't over yet. You're very warm! You shouldn't be running around with a fever. I’m often feverish. Every evening? You should get an X-ray. - Doctor? - Yes? It's Neeta. She keeps everything to herself. She won't say what's on her mind. I apprehend some trouble. She's feverish. And with Montu's accident, she's been running around trying to arrange for blood. She's under terrible pressure. We have no money. And now Neeta! If you have a moment, could you check on her? Neeta? Sit down. I’ve come to see Geeta. I’ve eaten nothing all day. Could I have some water? Where's Geeta? - Napping. Here. You're not at work? No. I stay home quite often. I don't like it there. What about you? Montu had an accident. He's in the hospital. I’ve been in a terrible state these two days. He needs a transfusion. There's been no time to even let you know. Neeta's here. So I see. How long have you been here? It's late. I have to go. You let her go? She didn't come to see me. You could have been more hospitable. You don't know, yet you jump to conclusions. I don't need to know. Montu had an accident. He's in the hospital. I didn't even find out what she came for. What's your name, dear girl? You'd be wise to get an X-ray. I could arrange it for you. And what if I really am ill? I’m the only breadwinner. In any case, the blood's needed immediately. - How's Montu? - All right. Shall we get some tea? Can you help me get some money? He needs blood and medicine. I can't get anything anywhere. That's why I went to see Geeta. How much? 150 Will do. Come with me. What's wrong? Nothing. I feel dizzy. You should get some rest. I say it for your own sake. My Sake? I look like one of hell's ravens... working myself to death. Where is he? Come along. I'll bring the money here tomorrow. - Where are those 150 rupees? - I gave them to Mother. You mean Neeta. You're right. It's my money. - An old flame - - Stop it! Control your tongue or you'll be sorry. I’m warning you. Come to my arms, Uma In your garland of flowers Your heart is full of sorrow O Mother deliverer Go, my daughter, to your husband's house Leaving my house desolate Did you hear about Shankar? He's made quite a name for himself in Bombay. It was even on the radio. What's wrong with you? - Why? Making your bed in the outer room at this late hour? Inner room or outer room... it's all the same in this godforsaken house. You plan to go on hiding everything from me? When there was time to listen, you weren't interested. Now there's an unbridgeable chasm between us. This tongue of mine! This tongue of mine! I’ve lost control of it. It's built a wall between me and the whole world. Spare me your sob story at this late hour. I work in the morning. Are you going to work? I have something to say. Come. No. - What can we do now? - So I should go on acting a part? It's not acting. Perhaps it's our penance. Penance? But you never sinned. Didn't I? I never protested the wrongs done me. That's my sin. The truth 'vs... I shouldn't have been so ordinary. Go on home. You have nothing else to say? What else can I say? Now that I think about it... it's all quite distant now. Now there's only work. Neeta, you've been made clean. I want to be clean too. I'll quit my job and go back to a life of struggle. Whatever obstacles arise, I'll face them. I may be rotten, but I have my limits too. I can't go on banging my head against a wall. No, she's fine. Give her this at night and keep an eye on her... What happened? She took a little fall. Miss Chakraborty, are you ill? No. I can ask the manager to give you time off. Don't bother. He won't do it. A poor brahman in Mathura Who had never known happiness Begged all over town one day But received no aims He sat beneath a tree disheartened And wept long and hard Then the sage Satyanarayana Approached in the guise of a fakir “O brahman... Why do you sit weeping on the ground?” The brahman said, “Will telling you help me?” The fakir replied, “What do you have to lose?” Let's see your bandages! Stop running around in your condition. Did you prepare the holy offerings? Go on! Go on. God doesn't give you more than you can bear. With his grace we learn to stand up straight again. Go on. Husband, did you hear? The boss himself brought Montu home! My Montu still has his job. And they'll pay compensation too! Over a thousand rupees. Right, Montu? Sit down. “The auspicious moment has come to be united with my lord A moment of supreme happiness and joy,” says the young woman Isn't that Shankar? When did you get back? Your picture's in the papers! Made it big in Bombay, did you? Sort of. An autograph. Shankar, I heard you sing on the radio. You're the pride of Bengal. Show 'em how a Bengal tiger roars! I heard you get 500 rupees per concert! Me? No. I never sing for less than 1,200. My body is fragrant with perfume My forehead is marked with sandal paste My doe eyes are lined with kohl My husband, Amar Muni, awaits I asked you to get here earlier. Why so late? You've gotten quite a name! They say you make thousands! People say you're terribly famous. - Really? If it's a boy, you have to buy me a necklace. All right. Won't you come back home to live? If the house doesn't suit you, redo it! Son! Corning! Eviction will always be a threat for us. Yet we shore up our courage, think of family, and forget our woes. Husband, tell him... how I've always wanted a two-story house. Tear this down and build two stories. The kitchen can stay as it is. That's easy enough to repair. Repair? Can you do that? Can you repair my mind too? So I can read Wordsworth again and feel that satisfaction... “Swan and shadow, float double!” He's gone crazy in the head. Where's Neeta? Neeta? Over in that room. She goes to work, then returns to that room. Eats there too. Has nothing to do with anyone. Keeps everything hidden. She's feverish and ill... but doesn't tell anyone. Even washes her own dishes. What's this? Love letters at your advanced age? Let me see! - No, don't! I was just watching all of you. It's wonderful how you've each found your niche. It's like when we were kids. It's just like when we were kids. I have no responsibilities now. What's wrong? Neeta has T.B. An advanced stage. My poor sister! I accuse! Whom? No one. I'll arrange for treatment and come back this evening. I'll stay here tonight. I packed up your things. Leave here. Go away. They're dreaming of two stories now. You were successful! You set them all on their feet. Father! Why Stay any longer? Now they just pity YOU- You weren't up to carrying the burden... yet you were forced to. Now you yourself have become the burden. Your breath is poison now! This room is for the newborn. Leave. Go away! Come to my arms, Uma In your garland of flowers Your heart is full of sorrow O Mother deliverer Go, my daughter, to your husband's house Leaving my house desolate How can this grieving mother Bear to let you go? Where are you going? Idiot! I just made arrangements at a sanatorium in the Shillong hills. Yes, the hills. At last you'll see the hills. - Come with me. - Yes. She likes hills? Oh, very much. Right from her childhood. We make her sit there, since she's better now. Oh, yes, I am happy, Sister. But remember: Don't excite her. She may have a relapse, which is dangerous. Keep her happy. Yes, Sister. She is there. Thank you, Sister. Please don't mention it. A “cloud-capped star.” Sanat's letter. I wonder why I kept it so long. You know, the house has a second story now. And Geeta's son is walking. - Is he mischievous? - Yes! I'll bet he's always jumping around and playing. He's made Father's life hell. He's always climbing the stairs by himself! That kid's so full of life, always raising a racket! He can't resist the urge to climb those stairs! I really did want to live! I really did want to live! I love so much to be alive! I Will live! I Will! Tell me just once I'll live. Nurse! I Will live! I Will! Have you lost your mind? Why are you yelling like a madwoman? I Will live! Shankar, is that you? Back from seeing your sister? How is she? Why don't you say anything? No one around here remembers her anymore, how she'd pass by every day, her sandals flapping. Such a gentle girl. Why did she have to suffer so?
