That's how my mom explained it to me. My parents, my mom and my dad, had sat me down. They're like, "This is... It doesn't get "any higher than this. "This is the Olympics. That's it. "These athletes have worked their entire lives "for this moment, "and that's why they go to the greatest lengths to try and win."

For me, I don't want to say I would've done anything differently if I could do it all over again. I was competitive. I was hungry. I loved it. I chose it.

Any little step I could take, anything to get the edge or advantage over my competitors and to win. My world was based on that for sure. - I went five or six years straight, 365 days a year. The difference between great and good: I think the greats do things when they don't always want to, and I think that's what makes them great. I looked up to Jordan forever. That guy probably didn't want to play basketball every day. He's the GOAT. Peyton, he didn't have to study film for thousands and thousands of hours. He did it because he wanted to be great. - Up!

Was not really a hard choice... Go to the Olympics or go to college... And I basically chose sport over academics. I started winning everything. It was addicting. It was fun. I just got sucked in. - I didn't develop outside interests. I had a very singular focus on my sport and on figure skating. It was like a compulsion. It was necessary. - Most of my career, I was driven purely by a fear of failure, so, unlike a lot of athletes who are driven by "I want to win, I want to be the champion," I was driven purely that I felt that I was inadequate. I wasn't the best guy on the ice. I wasn't the guy who was the most talented genetically, physically gifted. I could probably say I was the hardest worker, and I did the most amount of time in the sport, because of my obsession with "it wasn't good enough." Every day wasn't good enough.

You felt like everything was special, and you're trying to take it all in. As a track and field athlete, I had no clue if I'd ever make another Olympic team. Most track and field athletes only make one team, so I just wanted to make the most of the experience. [cheers and applause] - My first Olympics, I was 19 and the number one ranked skier in the world, and, you know, "Sports Illustrated" picked me to win the Olympic gold, and I was beyond nervous. I mean, it was paralyzing. [crowd chanting "USA!"] - It's a whirlwind. It's nothing like any competition I'd ever been to before.

The guy in fourth, you never hear from that person. He disappears. He dissipates. He becomes a civilian. It's gold and then what? [crowd groaning] - So with all the hype surrounding Bode Miller coming in here to possibly medal in all five events, he will not have a medal at all. - Mainstream media, especially in America but really everywhere, they love that feeling of building somebody up because that gives them control over the situation. You know, they pump them up, pump up expectations, and then it's good news, it's good content if they can chop their legs out from under them and see a hero come crashing down.

And now I'm known as a girl who hits hurdles. - She looked to have the gold in her pocket. - I got ripped across the media, like, "Oh, she had all these sponsors. How could she not medal?" Like, "She's such a freaking flop." It was so overwhelming, and I had no one to talk to. I would be washing dishes, like, months later, and I'd think about it, and I'd literally be frozen, like, "What could I have done differently?" I'd be walking in the grocery store, day's going fine, and then someone would come up to me: "Oh, I feel so bad for what happened." - It was painful to see my family's reaction to it, what they had to go through.

Like, you're happy to be home, but it's just this, like, isolated, cut-off feeling. - Why do you think so many of the athletes get depressed when they come home from the Olympics? - I think it's something that all human beings are susceptible to, and with athletes, it's even more so, I think, because we have such a great ability to hyper-focus. So if you are incentivized and you're focused on winning or you're focused on being the best you can at this one thing and you're putting all you have into that without any other balance, when that ends and then you're out of the fight-or-flight mode of, like, "I have to perform, I have to perform," you get left wondering, like, what do you do with your energy? I feel like we forgot about how human Olympians are and the needs we need as human beings. It's not about winning. It's not about performance. Granted, that would... That's all great, but what about our mental health? What about our families? What about our education? What about after sport?

That was a moment between... me and God or, you know, just me and the bedroom, and that was it. There was... Nobody else would get to know or find out, ever. And it wasn't till I wrote my book that I decided people need to know. And actually... [clears throat] One of the big motivations was, close friend of mine, an athlete, Jeret Peterson, killed himself about the time I was writing my book, and that's what triggered... It was kind of like, this is a big... this is like an epidemic. It's... not just him. There's a lot of people out there that are suffering through this. [wind howling] - I grew up with Speedy. Of course, he was on the aerials team. I was on the moguls team. And we were the young guys on the team. I looked at him like a carefree kid that had so much fun. He was always smiling. He was always happy. - And, Speedy, how did you get that nickname? - That nickname started when I was 11 years old when I went to my first camp. I had a checkered life jacket and a big racing helmet that I borrowed from my uncle... - Oh, okay. - And didn't really grasp the concept of waiting in line, and so I'd cut in front of all the other campers and get five jumps in the time they got two. - Okay, so it wasn't a girlfriend. - No, no, luckily. She'd probably be an ex-girlfriend. - It wasn't until 2009, when we were in Lake Placid at the Olympic Training Center for a World Cup, and he said, "Hey, can I chat with you for a second?" And I said "Sure." And we went to the TV room... It was night; it was dark; there's no one around... And he said, "You know, I want to open up to you for a second." And I said, "Sure, what's on your mind?" He started crying, and he said, "Most days, I don't want to be alive." And I didn't know anything about mental health at that point. I was so off-guard because I think of Speedy as somebody who's always been so happy and so successful, and I didn't know how to react, and I just said, "Speedy, look at you.

And Olympians are definitely a group who want to keep their pain out of sight. - It's very, very simple. Athletes... most likely don't get help for... depression or, you know, mental health issues because they can't even admit that it's an issue. That is so fundamentally at odds with being a competitor. This is war. It's a game of strategy. It's a game of maneuvering and posturing. You need to show the world that you are strong. You need to show all your competitors that you are strong.

So let's say that you make it to the Olympics. Some side effects may include an eating disorder, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, almost, like, a disconnect from the real world, and then when all those side effects do happen, there's nothing in play to, like, help you with those.

It's pretty unfortunate to say, pretty sad to say. ♪ ♪ - I think the last thing on my mind was, like, "How can USA Diving "and how can the Olympic Committee help me with this?" They can help me with my mental preparation and they've done a phenomenal job of, how do I mentally stay strong in my sport?

[applause] - This is it. I've said it before, but you guys can say it. This is the last time. No matter how your career goes or how long it lasts, there's one inevitable end we all have in common: retirement. It's not really natural to retire when you're in your 20s or 30s, and when you've devoted your life to a pursuit of such a singular goal and then leave it all behind, there's that giant question: now what? And even bigger: who am I? And the truth is, there aren't tons of programs in place to help athletes handle the emotions of that transition. - What is available to retired Olympic athletes post-career? I don't think there's anything. If you're talking about third-party resources that I'm aware of, I don't think there's any. There's none that I've used. There's actually zero that I have used in 9 1/2 years I've been retired. There's no pension. There's no bonus. There's no stock option. There's no job opportunity. There's no more coach. There's no more training environment. There's no more equipment. There's no more monthly stipend. There's no more prize money. Arguably, there's no more sponsorship. Yeah, that's reality. [laughs] - I'm really not aware of anything that exists for retired Olympians, but I really feel like the bulk of what the U.S. Olympic Committee does is to help fund hopefuls getting to their dream. - I will never regret competing for Team USA and this country, absolutely not. I have helped promote the Olympic sports for three Olympics. I've given my blood, sweat, and tears. I've given my talent. And all I'm asking is that after it's all said and done, someone can help me mentally get through this.
