London calling... with Frenchmen speaking to their countrymen. Take a look at that! What a handsome sight... ...the pride of the Third Reich! The brave sergeant taking coffee to the beachgunners. So that's a sample of the master race! In a pig's eye! In this darkest hour, in the gloom of night... ...we must not despair. For each of us... ...deliverance is coming! We need mines and obstacles along the whole coast. At every beach, on every dune... ...on every rock. How many have been installed? Four million, Herr Field Marshal. The work has completely exhausted our troops. Which would your troops rather be... ...exhausted or dead? Just look at it, gentlemen. How calm... how peaceful it is. A strip of water between England and the Continent... ...between the Allies and us. But beyond that peaceful horizon... a monster waits! A coiled spring of men, ships and planes... ...straining to be released against us. But not a single Allied soldier shall reach the shore. Whenever or wherever this invasion may come, gentlemen... ...I shall destroy the enemy there... at the water's edge! Believe me, gentlemen. The first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive. For the Allies as well as the Germans, it will be the longest day... ...the longest day! The poem by Verlaine? Play it back! Frenchmen speaking to their countrymen. Here are some personal messages. "The long sobs of the violins of autumn." I repeat: "The long sobs of the violins of autumn." Have you notified all commands? If Berlin is right, when we intercept the second verse... ...it will mean the invasion will come within 24 hours. Give me the text of the second verse. "Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor." We've intercepted hundreds of messages in the last year... hundreds! I've ordered alerts again and again. Why should this poem mean more than other messages? Tell me this: Does it give us any clue as to where they will land and when? Of course it doesn't. How can I maintain discipline if I keep my troops on the alert... ...just because a pair of nitwits in Berlin intercept a poem? No, Blumentritt... no alert! And especially not in this weather! - Anything else? - No, sir. Good morning, Field Marshal. - Any news? - Nothing important. Fighter bombers hit the Pas-de- Calais yesterday afternoon. Nothing much happened last night... the storm. That's all I'm interested in this morning... the storm. It came from nowhere... blew my roses to bits. There are five-foot waves in the Channel... ...and winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour. For the month of June... ...it's the worst Channel storm in 20 years. My appointment at Berchtesgaden? General Jodl will see the F?hrer today... ...and confirm the appointment for you. Will you still go to Germany as planned? Can you think of a better time? The weather is expected to continue like this for another week. Snap it up. Jerk the lead. Snap it up. Jerk the lead. Snap it up. Jerk the lead. You expect us to eat this slop again? I don't care what you do with it, mac. Eat it, throw it out. I get paid for cooking it. Come on. Put it on. Snap it up. Jerk the lead. Didn't you get any sleep? Are you kidding? I haven't slept since we got here. I got the absolute lowdown. It's on for tonight. For sure. Yeah. I got in this crap game with this guy from F Company. - He's an orderly for some general. - Move it. Move it. Hey, Hutchy! Hutchy, I want to ask you something. Hey, Hutchinson... ...do you think they'd let me write home? If it was really important? Not likely, mate. Security. I don't think old Churchill trusts us. It's the wife, you see. She's going to have a baby. Your first, is it? Oh, it's not mine, but I'm dead worried about her. She's not too strong, you see. Man, that stink. Diesel oil, backed-up toilets, vomit. And there ain't no place left to get sick in. The puke bags is full. The fire buckets is full. All we got left is our helmets. June. Every June my old man used to take me camping... ...up in the Blue Mountains. We'd hunt and fish all day long. And at night... ...we'd sleep out under the stars. Didn't even need a blanket. June. Wind and rain. Wind and rain. Don't it ever stop? Look, Dad, all I want to do is get going. Wind or no wind. Even if we land in Paris on the Eiffel Tower. - Come to think of it... - Colonel wants us. All of us. All troops will participate in ground tactics and deployment. In this weather, sir? Of course, Harding, if you can ensure that we'll land in France... ...in sunshine and dry weather. - Didn't mean that. - What did you mean? - It isn't the weather. It's the waiting. These men are itching to go. I don't think I have to remind you... ...that this war has been going on for almost five years. Half of Europe has been overrun and occupied. We're comparative newcomers. England's gone through a blitz with a knife at her throat since 1940. I am quite sure that they too are impatient and itching to go. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. Quite clear. Three million men penned up on this island. All over England, in staging areas like this. We're on the threshold of the most crucial day of our times. Three million men out there... ...keyed up, and waiting for that big step-off. They aren't exactly alone. Notify the men. Full packs and equipment, 14:00 hours. Yes, sir. This allows you more freedom. Quicker to get rid of when we hit the beach. - Well? - It's on. Tonight, as scheduled. - If the weather isn't worse. - How worse can it get? Ike has called a high-level conference for 9:30. I am not Eisenhower. I am an assistant division commander. I don't know from nothing, but he can't call it off again. Frank, turn that thing off. Four thousand ships loaded for bear. Troops ready to go. Eleven thousand planes on the line. Eighteen thousand paratroopers. God only knows how many gliders. Norm, relax. RAF says the gale can stop as suddenly as it began. So they told us yesterday and the day before. Look, Norm. We're all of us just as... ...dedicated to this thing as you are, just as anxious to get going. And that includes Ike. Now if he calls it off again, he knows what he's doing. Of course he does. I know that. I'm just thinking about those assault troops. 200,000 of them... ...out there on those ships. They're probably seasick as hell. Some of those men have been on those tubs for almost three days. I say go. Go. Weather or no weather. No! A hundred on the bone! Let's go. - Hey, give me $50. I'm busted. - I'm not doing so good myself. Hey, lend me $50? - Lend me 20 bucks? - Drop dead. Lend me $ 10? - Fifty on a bet. - I got it. One, two, three, four, five. Fifty! Let me hear it, let me hear it. - Five and two, four and three. - Six! That's the way we go! Seven points in a row. It ain't logical, it just ain't logical. - There's a hundred out there. - $ 100 dollars, $20 dollars. Anything open? - Forty more. - Forty more. You got a bet. - Okay, you mother-loving... - Just a minute. Wait a minute. Here you are. Use this. - You don't think I'd... - I don't think anything. I just like to hear the sound when it comes out of the cup. That's it. Shake it. Okay. Let me see what you do with it now. Go ahead. Shoot. - What is it? - Nothing. - Seven! - That's what I wanted! Who put this cup in the game? - Next shooter. Who's coming up? - I'll go $ 100. He's shooting a hundred. Who's got it? - Watch your side bets. - $ 100. You got a letter for me. Schultz, huh? Yeah, that's it. Thanks, buddy. - How much did you take him for? - Not much. Just a hair over $2500. - $2500? - Yeah. Oh, man, $2500? It's too bad you had to win it now. What do you mean, now? Suppose we take off tonight. What will you do with it? Five I take with me to Paris to blow on the broads and wine. A thou I leave here for seed when I get back. And the rest I send to my mother. Oh, man, $2500. And in Paris. You always was lucky. Hey, remember that night in Fort Bragg? I remember it. You know, I think I sneak over there and give it a big whang myself. Why not? What's to lose? Damn it. Why did he have to mention Fort Bragg? I was lucky, all right, in that crap game. Next day I break my leg in a jump. And two months in traction. $2500. That's more money I ever had in my whole life. I know. Man, I just know. I wonder how long it takes to lose $2500? Pint of sludge, Ted. Oh, hello, Dave. Hey, you seen Johnny? Yes. Well, where is he? Come on, Dave. I need my boots. Johnny's borrowed them. Where is he? At the bottom... ...of the Channel. You mean... ...he's bought it? Ack-ack over Calais. He jumped clean, but his parachute didn't open. That leaves just you in the squadron, Dave. I mean, of the old 1940 mob. What's always worried me about being one of the few... ...is the way we keep on getting fewer. Yeah. Poor old Johnny. Bad luck, it happening now. - Now, then. What's the difference? - He went through the Battle of Britain! And now if the big show starts tonight... ...he won't be in it. Look, will you please shut up about him? All right, all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You heard something about tonight? No, no. I haven't heard anything. - What are you talking about then? - Well, it's just... - Go on, go on. - I have a feeling it's on for tonight. - That's all. - A feeling. Take your feeling somewhere else. I've got a letter to write. I've had this feeling since I woke up. I've had it with me all day long. I can't shake it off. It's tonight. I know it is. All right, it's tonight. Suits me fine. Tonight. This afternoon. Now! I mean... ...as soon as I finish this beer. - General, can you spare me a minute? - Come in. - Thank you. - Can I get you coffee? - No, thanks. - I'll get some for myself. Is it still raining? On and off, off and on. Sometimes I wonder which side God's on. What? I say, sometimes I wonder which side God's on. Good question. What's on your mind, Van? I'm concerned about the placement of our drop zones. Go on. I know this is a hell of a late date to bring up something new... ...but you've given me a tough nut to crack. - It gets tougher every time I try. - I know, Van. Sainte-M?re-Eglise straddles the only road the Germans can use... ...to drive into our northern flank. But it has to be taken. And it has to be held. That's why I gave you the job, Van. - Can I use your board? - Of course. Here's the town. Heavily fortified. Down here is the swamp area that the Germans have flooded. And in between, four miles from the town, is our drop zone. Now if anything goes wrong and we undershoot... ...we land in this flooded area and are bogged down. If we overshoot, we come down like clay pigeons... ...smack dab in the center of Sainte-M?re-Eglise. That's why I gave the men training in low-level jumps near the villages. So I've heard. Got a complaint from the city council at Bexhall. Some of your men overshot the drop zone and landed in the town. - Tied up traffic for an hour. - That's true, sir. I was with them. Sudden crosswind hit us, swept us over the treetops... ...scattered us all over the place. - Where did you end up? - In the courtyard of a convent. Relax, Van. Sit down. The last few months have been a tough grind on all of us. I hear you've been working yourself and your battalion hard. Almost without a stop. Now that we're almost at the end of the line... ...why don't you try easing up on yourself and on the men? Sometimes a battalion can be sharpened to too fine a point. Sometimes a commander can too. Well... ...if there's any further delay... ...I request permission to submit a new placement for our drop zones. All right. Put it in writing. Make it official. That's your prerogative. But Ike has called a final meeting for tonight at Southwick House. If it's on, we'll get the green light by 9:30. - What are the chances? - Better than 50-50. Forget everything I said. I got the best battalion in this division... ...and they're ready. Here it is. The latest report. - It's Southwick House, sir. - Stagg here. Yes, sir. The new front's moving in much faster than we thought. Yes, sir, it's definitely improving. I'll be there, sir. 9:30. - Would you like some more tea, sir? - Coffee, and make it black. Please. One moment, Colonel Priller. Why wasn't he court-martialed? He shot down 132 planes. Don't call me "Pips, old boy." You were a rotten pilot when we flew in Russia. You're flying a desk now, but you're still a rotten pilot! What's that you're saying? I'm squatting here on this God-forsaken airfield... ...with only two planes... two stinking crates! Oh, sure, sure... your orders were followed! Now my squadrons are God-knows-where! My supplies are all gone. What am I supposed to do now? But Pips, we had to disperse our fighter squadrons... we had to! Look what happened to our airstrips around the Pas-de-Calais! The whole idea is absolutely idiotic! You move us back instead of forward! Sure, I know the weather's lousy and they probably won't invade... ...but what would happen if they did? But you know I can't get there with my equipment for two days. I tell you, you're all crazy! Priller has always been a hothead... ...but let's not underestimate him. What he says is not entirely illogical. What's the weather report? Slightly better over the Channel. I wouldn't be surprised if... - When's the next weather report? - Tonight at 8, General. Keep me posted on the weather. You made my dinner reservations? Yes, I did, General. Cancel everything. Shoes for my wife, I had them specially made in Paris... ...for her birthday... tomorrow, the sixth of June. Please wish her a happy birthday. Thank you, Speidel. Why didn't they attack in May? The weather was perfect... An attack now would be embarrassing. But I don't think we need worry. Is the plan ready, sir? Yes, yes, quite finished. War games... ...theoretical invasions. Rush to Rennes just to push little flags around a table. Playing at war! Do you win or lose, sir? Have I ever lost? But General, this time you play the role of Eisenhower. I win because I go against the rules. We expect them to cross at the narrowest part of the Channel... ...and in good weather. But that's too simple... too obvious. I choose the widest part, in the worst weather... and attack here. In Normandy. And in bad weather! Like now... ...bad weather! Trying to pick a trend is difficult. From a meteorological standpoint, conditions almost resemble mid-winter. And Normandy? High winds, clouds, and some fog over the beaches. However, I can say with a certain degree of safety... ...that we can expect a brief period of fair conditions. Let me summarize, then. What you're promising us is a barely tolerable period of fair conditions. Am I right? Yes. Conditions that are far below the minimum requirements. That's all I can promise. You've done your best, Stagg. Thank you, gentlemen. Well... ...there it is. We've postponed the attack once already. Now, either we go on the 6th, with only marginal conditions... ...or postpone again... ...in the hope of getting perfect conditions. What do you think, Monty? I say, go. Go. I must remind everybody... ...that the American convoy for the Omaha and Utah beaches... ...they've farthest to go... ...must be given the order within the next half-hour... ...if the assault is to take place on the 6th. We can't keep almost a quarter of a million men on ships... ...in embarkation areas, indefinitely. The longer we wait, the more acute our security problem. The next time... ...the tides and the moon will be right... Not before July. Gentlemen... ...such a postponement... ...is too bitter to contemplate. A brilliant plan, General. Unorthodox, but brilliant. Fortunately, it's only a game. I don't think we have much to worry about. Eisenhower would never take the gamble. Never. I'm quite positive we must give the order. I don't like it... ...but there it is. Gentlemen... ...I don't see how we can possibly do anything else but go. Wilson speaking. Yes, sir. It's on, sir. Ike's made the decision. Tonight, as scheduled! Colonel Tomson speaking. Thank you. Next stop... ...Normandy. God help us now. Gentlemen... ...the day we've been waiting for has arrived. Invasion! We're on our way. General. The orders have been given. It's on. Have the battalion commanders join me in the wardroom. All right, Sergeant. You men are the eyes of our airborne army. You, the pathfinders, will have one job, and one job only: To light the drop zones for our paratroops. Along with the British and Canadians you'll be the first men... ...to land in France. And remember this: When you get to Normandy... ...you'll only have one friend: God. And this. This... ...is Rupert. Now, we are going to drop Rupert... ...and a lot more like him... ...behind the invasion area. He's... ...a very extraordinary fellow, Rupert. He's sort of a... ...one-man army, all by himself. Let me show you. Let me show you what happens when Rupert... ...hits the ground. Sergeant, switch off the lights, please. All right, Sergeant, that's all. All right, come on. Simmer down. Come on, up. It's possible that Rupert and his men will do the same thing to the Germans. Confuse them, make them look over their shoulders... ...and launch an attack in the wrong direction. Ten-hut! - The crickets have been distributed. - So I heard. At ease! You're as ready as we can make you. This five-cent toy... ...wasn't issued to you for laughs. It may save your life. You're gonna be landing in the dark. On the other side of that hedgerow... ...the fellow may not be wearing the same uniform you are. So... ...one click... ...is to be answered by two clicks. And if you don't get that answering click... ...hit the dirt and open fire. I repeat: One click... ...must be answered by two clicks. Now, hang on to this gimmick. It's as important as your weapon. Do you read me? Loud and clear, sir. All right. One more thing. Your assignment tonight is strategic. You can't give the enemy a break. Send them to hell. That is all. London calling with messages for our friends. "Molasses tomorrow will bring forth cognac." "John has a long mustache." I repeat: "John has a long mustache." "John has a long mustache!" No, not yet... Oh, my Lord! "John has a long mustache." Make any sense to you, mac? As I said last night, they're code messages to the Resistance chaps. Obviously, one message means something to one group... ...and another means something to another group. "There is a fire at the travel agency." I repeat: "There is a fire at the travel agency." "Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor." I repeat: "Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor." The bridge... in forty-five minutes. We'll be back. "Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor." I repeat: "Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor." "There is a fire at the travel agency." The best hand I've had all night. Let me see here... Pardon me. Pardon me, General... it's come! Wait. Give that to me. What's come? It's the second part of the message. The second verse. "Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor." "Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor." We can expect the invasion within 24 hours! Put the Fifteenth Army on full alert. Thank you. You know, I'm too old a bunny to get very excited about all this. Now... where was I...? Oh yes, two spades! It's almost impossible to believe. Every dot represents a ship. You got battlewagons, cruisers, destroyers, minesweepers. You got assault craft of every size and every type. The biggest armada the world's ever known. Here. You remember it. Remember every bit of it. We're on the eve of a day... ...that people will talk about long after we're dead and gone. You wanna know something? It gives me goose pimples just to be part of it. You could call it one of them... ...crazy, quickie wartime marriages, you know? Met at a dance at the USO and all that... ...but, I mean, I took it serious. And so did she. We didn't do it just for kicks. - When did you get the letter? - Week ago. Two weeks. Maybe I was wrong, what I wrote her. I mean, she's a high-class model and all, and I... I'm not the kind of guy to get married that easy. I mean, it wasn't no joke to me. But oh, man, we really had some wonderful times together. And you think she's got a boyfriend? Well, she never actually said so... I mean... You think I was right? I mean, was I fair? She can't get one without your permission, right? You gotta give your okay. I know it's the law. They passed it for all the Dear Johns. Well, I guess I better be getting back to the outfit. Good luck. You too. Who was that guy? The one you was talking to so long? I don't know, Sparrow. I never saw him before in my life. Happy birthday, General... from your staff! Thank you. Will you cut the cake, sir? I trust you don't expect me to eat it, too! What's that? Dummkopf, that's the "V for victory" sign. Three dots and a dash. Ain't you never heard Beethoven's Fifth Symphony? Release point coming up, Major Howard. Right, prepare for landing. Cutting loose now. Roger and out. Major Howard, I cannot overestimate the importance of your task. The Orne River Bridge must be captured before the enemy can destroy it. It's a vital military artery, and the enemy has prepared it for demolition. It must be taken by surprise and captured intact. Your gliders will land at night, without the benefit of ground support. You will assault the garrison, overwhelm it... ... and hold until relieved. Hold until relieved. Major Howard! There's the bridge coming up. Just on our left. Right, link your arms. Brace yourselves. Feet up! Hang on! Smoke screen. Smoke. Up the action, bucks! Up the action, bucks! Right, Tom. Over the bridge. Check for demolition charges! Hello! Hello! Clear. It's working! Where's the doc? On the third glider. There's no report from them. Walsh. Sir? Tom, Ruskin and Royal have had it. Take over. On the other end of the bridge. - What happened to you? - Broke it on landing. - Isn't the doc with you? - No, he's missing. We crashed in the river. Afraid we've got a lot of casualties. I'm all right, sir. So are the boys. - Okay, carry on. - Right, sir. Come on! Well, I'll be... Hey, doc! Doc! What are you doing there? That's the German side. Sir, anybody can make a mistake. Sir? The demolition charges have been removed. It's all clear. Good. Corporal Smith. Send out the success code words. Keep sending until acknowledged. - John, set up HQ in that pillbox. - Right, sir. All in less than 15 minutes. Only a matter of time before they counterattack. - What about the paratroopers? - 7th Para might not get here for hours. And Lovat and his commandos... It could be midday before they get here. The question is, how long can we hold? Hold until relieved. Hold until relieved. It's raining again. Thank you. Did you get the list? Gen. Schlieben of the 709th has already left for the war games. The Commander of the 243rd left for Rennes at 18:00 hours. Also, Zimmermann of the 352nd... twelve officers in all. Yes, I know. The weather is bad, so everyone enjoys an extra night in Rennes. I don't like it. Any of it. So many key officers are away at the same time. I don't know why, but I don't like it. But the war games have been scheduled for a week... Yes, for tomorrow... not tonight. Advise all officers who have not yet left for Rennes... ...to postpone their departure until tomorrow. May I remind you, General... ...that the Allies have always landed in perfect weather conditions. North Africa... Sicily... Italy... Yes, and always at dawn! We're 11 minutes from the green light. Now, once more, I repeat: If, for any reason, we fail to hit our drop zones... ...move north by east. North by east. The Germans have flooded large swamp areas behind the coast. Avoid them if possible. We came here to fight, not to swim. Do you read me? Loud and clear, sir. How'd you make out? How did you make out at the game? I lost. Now we're both jumping clean. I understand. And when will the Field Marshal return? I see. Oh, well. Just a moment. The radar report. We are getting reports of strong radar interference... ...and radio reception is jammed. I realize this has happened before, but never this effectively! And the... Call the OB West? Very well. Give my respects to the Field Marshal when he returns. Bye, Rupert. Do your duty for God, king, and your country. Call for reinforcements! We're under attack! - Are we late? - No, but... ...we must hurry! What is it? I'll go. Stop! We said, stop! Stop, or I'll shoot! What are you doing here? I live in that farm. Nobody lives in that farm. - It's abandoned. - Show me your papers. Hurry up! Come with me. Go on! Put your bicycle there. Hans! Hans, where are you? - What's going on here? - Nothing! Who is with you? I want to know! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Good luck at the war games, General. Anything important? Communications reports difficulty in contacting our forward posts. The Underground again! Some sort of rubber dummies have been dropped by parachute. Rubber dummies! Connect me with General Richter! We can expect commando raids and other diversionary tactics... ...but I don't like this idea of dummy parachutists. Are you certain? How many? What do you think of it? Paratroopers... Put it over there. This is what they dropped, they explode on contact with the earth. In the dark, they look like soldiers. Perhaps these are what General Richter saw, not real paratroopers. When you create a diversion, it's for a reason. Connect me with General Pemsel! Dummies...?! Rubber dummies! I agree with you, General. I'll call you back. What about my call to von Rundstedt? We haven't been able to reach him. The main lines seem to be cut. They wouldn't drop dummies... ...unless it was to divert our attention from something else. In this weather? In any kind of weather! I must get in touch with OB West. They're enemy paratroopers! Blimey, mate... ...you'll wake up the whole blooming German Army! Fellas! I'm hung up! Fellas! - Are you all right? - Yeah. Where have you come from? Awfully sorry, old man. Simply landed here by accident. What's that? Sorry I startled you. I'm trying to find my communion set. Your what? My communion set. I've lost it. Now listen, padre. We've got no time to look for... I'm sure that it was here that I lost it. We're under fire, padre. Don't you think we ought to... You go on, my boy. Go on. I'm sure I shall only be a minute. Cor! Stuff a grouse. I've got it! I've got it! Glory be. Now, my son, let's go about God's work this night. Pluskat. Hello, Pluskat! Do you hear me? Nothing that I've heard... The usual bombing, but quite distant. Oh, yes, I can hear it. Well, wait a minute. Yes, just a moment. Flares... but a long way up the coast. Yes, Cherbourg is getting hit again. There's probably nothing to it... ...but we have had reports of paratrooper landings. I'll go to my bunker and take a look. Thank you, sir. Higher! Higher! Louis, open your store. We need more buckets! Mayor Renaud, you must come with me immediately. - Is it important? - Very important, Mayor Renaud. What's wrong, madam? I was on my way to the little house outside... Suddenly, I saw a man fall from the sky. - A parachutist? - Yes, that's right. He looked like a big white bird! - British or German? - What? The parachutist... was he a friend or an enemy? I don't know. He disappeared without a word. Just "Shh!" - Without a word? - Just "Shh!" Bonjour, madame... ... je suis am?ricain. Bonjour, mademoiselle... ... je suis am?ricain. We seem to be circling. Maybe they're having difficulty finding the drop zone. Je suis... ... am?ricain. Je suis am?ricain. Voulez-vous... ... mademoiselle? Okay. Go! Go! Paratroopers! Anything new? Heavy bombing over Cherbourg as usual, sir... ...and now near Caen. The lines to Stations 6 and 8 have been cut... ...but the direct line is open. I'll stay for a while. - Would you like coffee? - Yes, thank you. For God's sakes, padre, stop that damn noise. I'm sorry, son. I'm afraid I'm lost. Well, who ain't? Now, come on. Two clicks. I heard two clicks. Man... ...am I glad to see you. - You guys the 82nd? - No. This is the 101. 101? Where's the 82nd? Look, bud, we don't even know where our own outfit is. Well, somebody's shooting at somebody. Let's us go find this war. Come on. Maybe they're Limeys and ain't got no cricket. They must be our guys. Okay. No. Hey. Hey, they were Germans. Hundreds of planes have been flying to my left and right. Toward Caen. Now over the Cherbourg peninsula... something must be happening! But what, Pluskat, what? I haven't the faintest idea. Has anything been observed on the beaches? No... nothing. Yes, I'll let you know right away. Of course. Are you positive that ankle's broken? Compound fracture, sir. Well, put the boot back on and lace it up... ...tight. Don't get mad, I didn't break it. And you're not walking on it. - You're not going to try... - Knock it off and do as you're told. Yes? A, B and C Company are scattered all over like we are. Go on. Conklin landed on a stone wall, broke his shoulder. I left him with a medic. Any contact with F Company? No, but they must be up ahead in the direction of Sainte-M?re-Eglise. Well, go ahead. Tie it off. Tie it off. Well, here's where we are. The northern edge of the swamp area... ...five miles from our drop zone. Five miles. - F Company? - No, sir. And we've got scouts all over the place. We even picked up a group from the 101. F Company were the first of the lead planes. Well, give me a hand. Can I have my rifle? Well, we'll head out this way. We ought to reach high ground and open country by daybreak. All right. Have the men spread out... ...pick up any stragglers they can find. - Pass the word. - Right, sir. All right, men, spread out. Pick up stragglers you see. Pass the word down. All right... ...let's go. From the latest reports, this is how I see it: American paratroopers have landed... British paratroopers... The invasion... Yes. Thank you, Pemsel. General Pemsel is convinced that this is the invasion! I do not agree with him. This is my conclusion: Normandy is the objective of a diversionary attack. A diversionary attack, Blumentritt. It's not the main attack. That will come at the Pas-de-Calais... ...where it was always expected. Where we always expected it! But we can't take any chances. I want the reserve panzers moved up at once! We need approval from the F?hrer's headquarters. They wouldn't dare refuse me! Call the F?hrer's headquarters and insist. Insist that the panzers be released to me immediately! An invasion of Normandy would be against all military logic. It would really be against all logic... Well, that about covers it, gentlemen. Most of you have had your feet wet before: Dunkirk, Dieppe, Norway. And we know what it means to be driven into the sea. In a few hours we're going back from the sea. And this time we're going to stay. There's no time for any sob stuff about... ...England, home and beauty. Remember, our people have had a rough time for four and a half years. They've earned the final victory. Let's give it to them. And to our French comrades in arms, I say: Good luck. Tomorrow morning, we'll take them. Come in, Teddy. Did you have to put it in writing? I knew you wouldn't let me go unless I did. You're putting me on the spot. - I didn't mean to, Tubby. - The hell you didn't. You put that request in writing, made it official. You're the assistant division commander. And that's why I'm supposed to go ashore in the first wave. That's where I'm supposed to be. You know that. You're important to this operation. We can't have you knocked off on the first day. But that's not the real reason. Isn't it because my father was president of the United States? And a great president. And a great soldier. He led the charge of the Rough Riders up San Juan Hill. So now you've got to be the first man ashore on Utah Beach. But that's where I'm supposed to be, Tubby. That's my job. Also, I've been there side by side with the men all through training. They're used to seeing where I belong. They have a right to expect me there. President's son or not. Is my request denied? No, you know it's not. Request reluctantly approved. Thanks, Tubby. Thanks a lot. Say... ...how's that arthritis of yours? Arthritis? Haven't had a touch in months. Glad to hear it. The street... ...the bridge... ...the hotel... ...the casino. One more thing... You have been fighting everywhere for four years... ...in Abyssinia, Libya, Egypt, Crete... But this time you are going to fight on French soil... ...in our fields... ...in our villages... ...under the eyes of our own people. The F?hrer took a sedative, I won't wake him for these reports. First we hear that the paratroopers are shot down plane crews. Next they are identified as mechanical dummies. If paratroopers have landed... ...it can only be a commando raid. Is that a sufficient reason to send the panzers to the coast? I will submit all reports to the F?hrer as soon as he awakens. I understand. Jodl has turned us down. He will not release the panzers without the F?hrer's approval... ...and the F?hrer is still asleep! Will you tell von Rundstedt? No, not now... Not now. Thank you, gentlemen. Sit down. This is history! We are living an historical moment. We are going to lose the war... ...because the glorious F?hrer has taken a sleeping pill... ...and is not to be awakened. It's unbelievable. Think of it, Kurt. Don't ever forget it. We are witnessing something... ...which historians will always say is completely improbable... ...and yet it is true. The F?hrer is not to be awakened! I sometimes wonder whose side God is on. Can I... ...bring you anything, sir? In my room there is a bottle of excellent cognac... ...Napoleon, unopened. I was even saving it for a fitting occasion. This isn't exactly the right occasion, but get it anyway. Daylight at last. A whole night wasted again! Where's my dog? He was here a minute ago. Let's have one last look. Not even a seagull... My God! The invasion. They're coming! It's the invasion! There must be five thousand ships out there! Get hold of yourself, Pluskat. The enemy doesn't have even half that many. Well dammit! Come and see for yourself, you fool! It's amazing. It's beyond belief. My dear Pluskat, where are these ships heading? Straight for me! General, in exactly two minutes... ...the fleet will open fire. Your attention, please. The Admiral has an announcement. Soon we shall be engaged in battle. To drive the enemy out, we must fire on our homeland. This is the price of liberty. Long live France! There he goes, right on time... as usual. They're landing! They're coming! They're coming! I'm not crazy. Look, they're landing! The Americans, the English and the French! Do you hear me? What's the matter with you? What's going on? You must be deaf! Can't you...? Dammit can't you hear it for yourself? We're under fire. Yes, under fire! Those five thousand ships you say the Allies haven't got... ...well, they've got them! It's wonderful! Yes? What is it now? Listen to me, Pips. The invasion has started! Put yourself on alert at once! What the hell can I do with only two planes? Where are the others, you idiots?! Priller, that's an order! Get ready at once! Understand? If it isn't too much trouble... ...would you tell me where the invasion is? Normandy! How delightful! Thanks my faithful Hans. That's the end for us! So long! It's getting very difficult to get any sleep around here. Your prospects for a long sleep are excellent. The invasion has begun. We're flying there, the two of us. Nobody else is left. I don't think we're coming back. The shelling has stopped. Landing craft approaching. Return to headquarters. Direct your troops from there! Landing craft approaching the coast! Those French bastards! Sergeant! Send this to headquarters by courier. No! Take it yourself. Tell them our lines are cut! Gentlemen, come here please. There it is, men. Omaha Beach, dead ahead. Lock on the target! Stand by! Get off of the beach! Let's go! Come on, move up! Hello, General, sir. Are you all right, boy? Yes, sir. Don't you think you better go back and get your rifle? Out there, sir? You're almost sure to need it before this day is over. Yes, sir. Come on! Move on up! Let's go. Medic! Medic! General, first reports from Omaha, sir. "Assault teams have landed. No direct radio contact, but destroyers report... ...first and second waves appear pinned down on the beach. Concentrated artillery and mortar fire. Third wave floundering." Heavy casualties, sir. When the mortars and machine guns are silenced... ...have the battalion commanders join me... ...over there. Okay. Hang on to that map case, Eddie. I made it. Hey, I made it. Did you see me get those two guys? Hey, Sergeant? Sergeant? As best as I can figure it, this is the wrong beach. We're a mile and a quarter south of where we were supposed to land. We should be up there. Control boat must've been confused by the naval bombardment smoke. I agree with you, but what will we do now? Our reinforcements and heavy equipment will approach in a very few minutes. - I know, I know. - What if they land at the right beach? The reinforcements will have to follow us wherever we are. We're starting the war from right here. - Head inland. We're going inland. - Okay, let's go. Follow me. Do everything I do! All right. Let's go! Head for home! The Luftwaffe has had its great moment! Stand by to beach. Duncan, take care of that strongpoint. Any minute now. Stand by! Let's give it them back for Dunkirk! You hear that? Dunkirk. Do you hear it, Clough? Sure he was at school at the time. Come on, you bums! Come out, you dirty slobs! Flanagan's back! The evil of it all. Drowning a man before he fights. Oh, come on! Keep those vehicles moving! MP, chase out those cyclists. Get off the beach! Move inland! Come on, you lot! Hurry it up. Never mind the blathering! We must put these down somewhere. The sooner you get off the beach... ...the sooner they'll stop this blasted shelling. It's very bad for the dog! Down, Winston, down! Beach Master Sword, Section 2-A. Third wave ashore on time. No obstruction to follow-up. Standing by. Get going! For heaven's sake, get that carrier off the beach! I was told I could transmit a newsflash on your radio. If you can't drive it, carry it! You were saying? I was told I could transmit a newsflash on your... My dear fellow, I don't want to appear uncooperative... Yes, I know all about the power of the press. But this line happens to be rather busy! Come on! Down, Winston. Down, Winston. What did he say? The answer is no. We have to use the damn pigeons. I've got these ready. Here, clip this on. They're going the wrong way. Not toward the Germans, you idiots! The other way! The other way! Damned traitors! - Hold it. - Can't you get your finger out? What's the matter? Engine won't start, sir. Full of seawater, I think. My old grandmother used to say... ...anything mechanical, give it a good bash. Try it now. Thank you, sir. Off you go. Good luck. I'm sure that got it out. That's what I call a hell of a man! Aye, I like his dog too. Don't stand there yapping! This isn't Hyde Park Corner! The war's over there! Come along! Come on! - Thank you. - Everything's going according to plan. Stand by to move. Millin, "Blue Bonnet." What in God's name...? Oh, my friends. What a day! What a day! Welcome to France. Welcome to Colleville! Most kind of you. Very nice to meet you... Look at this. I kept it for you all. But I don't think there will be enough for everyone. Perhaps next time. We have a previous engagement: The war! Mustn't lose that champagne! All right, men, fall in! Millin, "Blue Bonnet." Goodbye. Thank you, boys! Thank you! Long live France! Long live the Allies! If you ask me, Flanagan... ...there's a lot of very peculiar blokes on this beach. Welcome! Welcome to you all! Thank you, dear, they're lovely! Better try them on first. Rommel speaking. Good morning. What? What! Where? Normandy! Have they a foothold already? They must be thrown back! What about the panzer reserves? Did von Rundstedt obtain their release from the F?hrer? Normandy! How stupid of me! There it is. You mean to tell me that's all we gotta climb? They're not as high as the practice ones. They wasn't shooting at us then. Why can't the Air Force or Navy do this job? The big guns in bunkers behind the cliff can't be seen from the air. We knock them out or they'll murder our guys on the beach. Yeah, well if you ask me... ...three grandmothers with brooms could sweep us off there... ...like flies off of a sugar cake. That's it, the one we're after. It's empty. The Air Force and Navy really plastered this baby. But I don't get... The guns. There ain't no mounts. They've never even been installed. You mean... ...we come up all this way... ...for nothing? Don't worry, sarge, you'll be all right. Medic! Medic! I wonder what "bitte, bitte" means? What the hell are you wearing a life preserver for? I can't swim. Normandy. It really is Normandy. This is madness... madness... sheer madness! I just talked to General Jodl... the F?hrer is awake. I don't care if he's awake or not! What about the reserve panzers? The F?hrer went into one of his tantrums... ...and no one dared bring up the subject. They're still held in reserve! Yes, Field Marshal. Sir, if you would call the F?hrer yourself... ...I am convinced he would respect your views. Call him? Call that Bohemian corporal?! Crawl on my knees to him?! No! It is out of the question! "Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor." What's that? Nothing... nothing of importance. Here, let me help you. You all right, Tom? Come on, they're up there. - Sir. - Well? Mr. Smith says to tell you he's stood his men too. The Jerries are moving up into the woods... ...with machine guns and mortars. - Tell the men to stand firm! - Tell the chaps... Tell them to expect another counterattack, a heavy one. - Here you are, mate. - Ta. What's the matter? Listen. I thought I heard bagpipes. Don't be daft! I told you I heard bagpipes! It's the reinforcements. It's Lovat! Come on! Come on! - Sorry I'm late. - Better than never, sir. Glad to see you, Shimmy. You boys are right on target. What's the situation? Jerry's regrouping in the woods, about a mile. With mortars and machine guns. Numbers? No idea, Shimmy, but they seem to be moving forward in force. In that case, we won't wait. We'd better get moving. All right, we're going across. - Millin! - Sir? "Black Bear," sir. All right, come on. Everybody up! On your feet! There he goes. He's at it again. Ever hear such a bleeding racket in all your life? Yeah, it takes an Irishman to play the pipes. Hold until relieved. Hold until relieved. North by east, north by east. Sainte-M?re-Eglise is that way. Somebody turned that sign around. Doesn't anybody in this outfit look at a compass besides me? Hey, you guys! Over here! Over here! Over here, on the double. - Where you taking that? - We don't know, sir. We took the wrong road. What do you got in here, ammo? Yes, sir. You 82nd? No, sir, 101. Well, you're in the 82nd now. - But, sir, we're... - But what? Nothing, sir. All right, move out. - Knock that sign down! - Yes, sir. - Something's moving up there, colonel. - Hit the dirt! Take cover. Lieutenant Sheen, sir, A Company. Colonel, it's me! - Where did you come from? - Sainte-M?re-Eglise. We hold the main road and north side of the square. The Germans have a battery on the other side of the town... ...and command the countryside. - And Major Lance? - Holed up in a building in the square. - F Company? They overshot the drop zone and landed in the middle of the town. Go on. It was a nightmare, sir. A slaughter. They were mowed down before they hit the ground. Major Lance sent me to try and contact you, sir. He wants your permission to pull back and regroup outside of town. No, damn it. We came here to take Sainte-M?re-Eglise. We're gonna take it and hold it. Follow the lieutenant, gentlemen. - Sir. - Thank you. British and Canadians advancing steadily from Sword, Gold, and Juno. Anything from Omaha? Nothing since the first message: Heavy fighting, heavy casualties. Sir. Omaha? No. I can't understand why Jerry hasn't brought his heavy armor into play. All the panzer divisions except the 21 st... ...seem to be sitting it out in the rear. Sir. French commandos driving inland from Sword... ...have reached the outskirts of Ouistreham. Ouistreham. Fall back! Take cover! Tank support! We must have tank support! I can't get them! Keep trying! We must have support! Hold your positions... I'm going for a tank! Give us as much cover as you can! Fire! Try for the cannon! Get the wounded out of here! Go back! Get out of here! You can't stay here! I am Mother Superior of the convent. The sisters are qualified nurses. But Madame... I mean, Mother, we're in the middle of a battle! Take care of the wounded. It's a tank! It's Kieffer! In the other direction! Clear away the debris! Hurry! But where is the Luftwaffe?! I'm trying... Yeah, yeah, you're trying. The British troops have a beachhead here. They are moving inland. The Americans hold Ste-M?re-Eglise and have cut the highway. We control this center section. The Americans have landed but their attack has bogged down. Rommel is right... If we can hold them on the beaches... ...the invasion will collapse. That thing still work? Yes, sir, now and then. - Anything from the other beaches? - Not directly. A while ago the sergeant picked up some flashes from the destroyers. The 4th Division is off Utah Beach and moving inland. Inland? - What about the 1 st Division? - They're hung up, sir. Like we are. Move out. - What do you think? - Think? We must have close to a thousand casualties up to now. Do you want me to have the ships start picking us up? - You think it's that bad? - I don't see what else to do. We can't get up this hill. If we don't get off this beach, we won't have any division left. What? These are our men, Tom. You think we brought them in so some die and ask the rest to turn tail? Hell, no. We're gonna get up that hill. Find me somebody to speak for the Rangers. Back down the beach on the right there's a gully. With a heavily defended roadblock and machine gun nests on both sides. - If we can blow our way through... - We've hit it three times. - We didn't get close. - Three times isn't enough. We're gonna hit it again. Can you find me some engineers? They're all around you! I mean engineers with equipment still working. Then I shouldn't radio the ships? No, damn it! We need bangalore torpedoes, bazookas, mortars, wire cutters... ...and every man that can stand. Pass the word, will you? Okay, Norm. Now listen to me, all of you. You guys got to snap out of it. We're getting off of here, and we're going inland. What about weapons, General? My men lost everything. They gotta have something to fight with. Strip the dead and the wounded. Pick up anything that'll shoot. I don't have to tell you the score, you all know it. Only two kinds of people are gonna stay on this beach: Those that are already dead and those that will die. Get off your butts! You guys are the fighting 29th! I've looked at the naval reports. Yes? According to reports from the offshore destroyers, Omaha is a shambles. There's no evidence... To quote the report exactly: "There is no evidence of any movement that can be observed off the beach." I'd better have a look through these. How is Ike taking it? Like everybody else, sir. Hanging on by his fingernails. No, no! We must regroup according to Plan Six! Can you hear me? I said we must regroup according to Plan Six. Nonsense! If the panzers arrive, we still have time to use them. We'll drive to the coast! Shall we remove the files? I don't care! I want to get to the front at once... to Normandy! Yes, General. - Where is everybody? - What? I said, where is everybody? I can't hear you. It's them bells. I've had them in my ears for 10 hours. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Hey, Sergeant, where's Major Lance? We moved the CP to that building. The major's there. Get him, the colonel's here. What? Hold it! Colonel, am I glad to see you! Those bodies. Get those bodies down. Why are you leaving them up there? Get them down! But we've been under fire, sir. I know you have, but I don't care! Get them down! Down! - I don't want those boys left there. - Take a detail and cut them down. - At once! - Yes, sir. Has there been a linkup between our forces and the troops from the sea? I don't know, Major. I don't even know if the landings took place. But I am sure we're gonna hold this town until the linkup does come. Whenever that is, today, tomorrow, till hell freezes over. For their sake, if for no other reason. Show me the enemy positions. Well, sir, the Germans' strong point is right there. That's over there on the hill. They've got no tanks yet. They've got heavy guns and machine gun positions at the top of that road. How many men have you got? Not enough. Lt. Wilson will take A Company and reinforce Major Lance. The rest of the command will follow us straight up that road. Good luck, Major. All right, A Company, fall out. - Private. - Yes, sir. It's a helluva war. It's a privilege to serve with you, colonel. Well, God willing, we'll do what we came here to do. Ready, sir. Move out! The old man sure has changed since yesterday. Or maybe it's just that we've changed... ...since yesterday. Lovat and his commandos have reached the bridge. Bob, did you hear? Yes, I heard. "Sainte-M?re-Eglise captured by units of the 82nd Airborne." "101 Airborne driving on Utah." That's good. Good. Yes, but if we can't get off Omaha it doesn't mean a damn. We know it. We'll have two cut-off beachheads, one in British zone and one at Utah. Yes... ...and the Germans in between. You guys engineers? Yes, sir. 299th. Where are your officers? Who's in charge here? I guess I am, sir. None of our officers made it in. What about your equipment? Those torpedoes work? Yes, sir, we'll make them work! - What's your name, Sergeant? - It's Fuller, sir, John H. You're Lieutenant Fuller from now on, whether you like it or not. You send some men down to the foot of that gully with those torpedoes. You and the rest of the men follow me. Yes, sir! All right, men! Let's move that equipment down here. - I got a rifle, sir. - Well, good for you, son! The Rangers are ready, General. Okay, Major, move them out. Captain, move them up. Move them up! - Well, Tom? - We're ready. As ready as we'll ever be. It'll work. It's got to work. We're getting murdered here! We might as well move inland and get murdered! - You ready? - Yes, sir. You're gonna blow that roadblock for me. When I give the word everything pops at once. Okay? Yes, sir. First, we gotta blow a hole through that wire with bangalores. If that works, we'll pack everything we've got into that wall. All right, let's go! All right, let's go! Go! Go! We must leave. The main highway is under aerial attack. You don't say! Don't worry, Yank. He's dead. Give me a cigarette. I'm dying for a cigarette. You hurt bad? Shot down during the night. He was gonna make sure of me, but I got him... ...with this. You ever killed a man? I mean, face to face? No. Neither had I, face to face. I've been sitting here looking at him. Have you noticed anything peculiar about him? No. He's got his boots... ...on the wrong feet. He must have been in a big hurry, huh? Is it bad? Split wide open... ...from the crotch to the knee. A medic came along and gave me a shot of morphine. I hope he'll be back before it wears off. He said he would. Did he sew you up? Well, when he came to shore he lost most of his equipment. So he pinned it together... ...with safety pins. Getting on toward night. You know something? I haven't fired my gun all day. I keep hearing shooting, but every time I get there, everybody's gone. Funny, isn't it? He's dead. I'm crippled. You're lost. I suppose it's always like that. I mean war. I wonder who won. Okay, run me up the hill, son.
