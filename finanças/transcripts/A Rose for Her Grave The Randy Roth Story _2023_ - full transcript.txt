(mellow music) - I have this dream, I lie in sombre. Water surrounds me. I breathe no longer. Death approaches, extending its hand. Now a friend I did not plan. But in this dream, I never wake. Tragedy now becomes my fate. (tense music) (muffled scream) (woman humming) (indistinct background chatter) (humming continues) (background chatter continues) (soft music) Thank you. - I'm so sorry. (sniffles) (sighs) You want me to kick everybody out of here? (chuckles) How about I get this little guy to bed? - Yeah. (sighs) (water running) (dishes clattering) - Hey... You wanna turn in? I can finish the rest. - What am I supposed to do now? This wasn't supposed to happen. (sniffles) I can't do this. (sobs) - Look at me. Yes, you can. - No, I can't. - I'm gonna be here. For you and tyson. And I will always be here. Do you hear me? I promise you. You're my best friend. - Okay. (sobs) I know. (sobs) I got you. I got you. I know. I know. (eerie music) (sighs) (soft music) (sighs) - Sun. Spun. Fun. Autumn. (water running) ah, it smells so good! - Coffee's ready! - Ah, I can't wait. - Ooh! Did you write anything good this morning? - Maybe. - Well, can I read it? - No. - And what is the point of poetry if you're not gonna share it? - This isn't just poetry, it's my journal, And I'm just... Not ready to... Lori, I told you, you don't need to pay me rent. You stayed. - Oh, stop. - You do this every month. - Yeah, and every month, I win. Come on, just let me contribute until I find my own family. Speaking of, it's grocery day, So if you want anything special, just let me know. - Pancakes, always. - Yes, that's a given. - Also, would you mind running by the bank for me? I need tyson's birth certificate for his passport. - Yeah, of course. Oh, did you decide where you guys are gonna go? - No, but we need to go somewhere. Like an adventure. If tom were here, he would've taken him somewhere. - Somewhere amazing, I know. - Yeah. (gasps) There he is! The little slugger. - Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! - Guys, it's just a game. - Just a game? What? This is the season opener! (joyfully exclaims) - Look at that. - Thanks, lori. - Hey! Why don't we hit the cages one more time before the big game? - Yes, please. - Yes.

He loves the game. - You know, hitting a baseball Is one of the hardest things to do in sports. You ever think about getting him on a travel league? - Oh, um, no, not really. - You gotta get through try-outs, But it opens up possibilities. Colleges, scholarships. - You think tyson could make it? - Well... I am the coach, so... (laughter) (cheers, applause) - Yes! - Here's your hot dog. - Thank you. - Hey, dad. - Hey. - Oh, can I have one? - Sure. - Ma'am, uh... Wanna go on a date with my dad? - Oh. (laughs) - Greg. - What?

Greg was pretty happy too. - Aww, he's a cute kid. - Well, I will put these in water for you. - Thank you. - And you two kids have fun. - We will. I'll be sure to have her home before midnight. (chuckles) What kind of food do you like? - Any food. - Feel like italian? - I love italian. - That's my specialty. (spy movie music on tv) - What? - You okay? - Yeah. - You know you can talk to me, right? - I mean... It's a little weird. Mom on a date. But she should get to have a little fun too, I guess. I always got you, right? - You bet, kid. Popcorn fight! (laughs) (mellow music) - You're sure you don't want some? - Oh, no, I really don't do sugar, But don't let me stop you. (clicks tongue) - so... Greg seems like a nice boy. - He sure is. You can ask me if you want to. (chuckles) - You got me. Is greg's mom still in the picture? Because I would never... - No. We lost her. Janis. That was her name. She was a great mom. (sighs) - I'm sure. - Cindy. There is something I need to tell you.

(chuckles) What can I say? He's... (sighs) ...He's amazing. - I'm waiting for the "but." - Well, he lost his wife. - He's a widower? - Two years now. - Really? I didn't get that from him. - Well... We both know how difficult that can be, don't we? - Sure. - You don't think I'm making a terrible mistake, do you? - No. - You approve? (laughs) - Not so fast, we'll see. (soft music) (birds chirping) (children laughing) - Hi! Oh, you must be the best friend, lori, right? - That's me. And you are? - Hi. I'm megan. This is my husband, john, And that's our... Well, john's daughter, dana. - Oh, it's nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. - How long have you guys known randy? - Ah, it's going on five years now for me. - Yeah, randy and john are thick as thieves. Oh, dana, honey. Dana, come meet someone. Dana? - Dana! - Uh, teenagers, right? And the divorce adds to it too, you know. Well, I better deliver the salad. It's so good to meet you. - Don't dress them until they've been cut. That way, the oil soaks in better. Then, some olive oil. And... ...A touch of salt. - I can't wait. Oh, and I started eating spinach With my eggs in the morning, just like you showed me. - And you feel full longer, right? - Yeah, all the way until lunch. - It's good, sweetheart. Hey, would you do me a favour and go inside and get me some more tin foil? - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. - I know, she's like a second kid. - I wasn't gonna say anything. - She had a rough patch. It was a nasty divorce. Trouble at school. It might have had to do with her struggling with her weight. I was just showing her some healthier habits. - Mm-hmm. Well, that's very sweet. (soft music) (chuckles) - Her hair had one, not two. Yeah. (overlapping chatter) (laughter) (indistinct whispering) ...On the wall. (clinking glass) - excuse me. I just... Don't mean to interrupt. I just wanted to say what a pleasure it is to host you all. Some of my best and oldest friends, And some great new ones too. And if that wasn't enough to celebrate, I just learned here that this lovely young lady... ...Has lost three pounds. - Way to go, sweetheart. - Way to go, dana! (chuckles) - We are so very proud of you. - Randy made a deal with her. He gives her $100 for every pound. - Great job, sweetheart. - Thanks. (eerie music) You see this? One, two, three.

He's so polite. - That's what we learn in the service. Chivalry, honour, order. It was pretty nasty over there. - Do you mind if I ask you how you lost your... - Janis. - I'm so sorry. - Yeah. It was an accident. Janis loved climbing. We were on mount rainier. She slipped, fell, dead on impact. - Uh... I'm... That's horrible. - Yeah. (ominous music) Hey, guys. - Hey. - You guys having a good time? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Well, what do you think? - Uh... Wow! It's... It's beautiful. - No, not about the ring, about the man. What do you think about randy? I mean, I know it's only been a few months, But I just... I feel like... Like, this just feels right. I feel like he's the one. - Well, you did say you did just start dating, so... Maybe it is a good idea Just to date a few other men, just to see. - Are you kidding? Randy's perfect. Tyson is finally gonna have a father again. - Okay, cindy, I'm just gonna be honest with you. Listen, I know he seems nice, and he's charming. To you, at least, and to tyson too, But other times, he's-- - lori. (sighs) I'm okay. You don't have to protect me anymore. I love you. - I love you too. (squealing excitedly) (laughter) - Alright, everyone, cheers! To my amazing new family. (all): Cheers! - Woo-hoo! - This cider is so good. - Thanks, mr. Roth. - No, it's "dad," now. Or coach. Either one is fine. (chuckles) Greg, would you mind grabbing another one for me? - Yes, sir. - That's good. Yeah. - That's pretty good. - So, greg, how are you feeling? New family, new brother. - Good, ma'am. Tyson's cool, and his mom is, like, really nice. - Well, having known cindy for 20 years, I can say she's amazing. - Yeah, they always are. (ominous music) - Go ahead, son. I just wanna let you know that... You're welcome here as long as you like. - What? - Me and greg, we're moving in. But, like I said, you can stay here as long as you want. No pressure. Excuse me. (crickets chirping) (randy groans) (cindy yells): No, no! Stop! (randy groans) - Hey, buddy, are you okay? (groaning) - Cindy! Hey! What's going on? (cindy screaming) Oh, my god! Randy! Oh my god, randy, get off of her! Get off of her! Stop it! Get off! (strangled moan) Cindy! Are you okay? (panting) Come here. Are you okay? - Honey, I'm so sorry. - Stay away from her! - No, lori. - Get away from her! - Lori. Lori, it's okay. - No, are you kidding? No! - Yes, just go.

To be the best, you need to train like the best! - Cindy, about last night... - Uh... Randy has ptsd. Admittedly, I didn't realize How severe those emotions can be. He saw a lot of bad stuff over there. - He was hurting you. - Yeah. He's working through it. - But cindy, you can't just... - He's my husband. That's all there is to it. (whistle blows outside) (randy): One, two, three, four, Five, six! (whistle blows) high knees! Come on! You got this! (dryer tumbling) - Hey, honey, it's okay. It's not a big deal. - I'm sorry. - Hey. It's okay, it's okay. You're okay. - Are you gonna tell my dad? - Greg, time for school! You hear me, bud? We gotta go. - Yes, sir. (tense music) - Here's some salad. - Can I have some garlic bread? - Yes. - Yeah. - Here we go! Veal parmesan with a pesto pasta And sauce tomate à la... - Wow, that looks exceptional. - His veal parm is the best. - Thank you, honey. Well, enjoy it while it lasts, Because for the next five days, chef randy is going on vacation. - Buenos aires... It sounds so fancy. - We will exclusively be dining out. - Don't worry, guys, I'm a star When it comes to anything microwaveable. (chuckles) - Well, I wouldn't have minded to watch greg and tyson While you guys are on your honeymoon. Although, I don't mind the extra help, dana. - Oh, that's okay, dana is just trying To earn some extra money for senior week. Speaking of, There's a scale in the bathroom, young lass. - Oh, and actually, tomorrow is grocery day, So if you have anything you want special, Let me know, besides pancakes. - Aww. - That's very generous, but I've already got it covered. I only buy organic. - Randy's more into eggs and bacon. - Protein is a healthier way to start the day, But I'm sure you knew that. - Four pounds! - Dana, you're crushing it! - Alright! There you go. Well done. - Well, I think you look beautiful either way, honey. - She sure does. (tense music) - Our winter is their summer, so it's spring-ish right now. - Do you have enough pink? (chuckles) - Don't mess with my pink, missy. - Hey, can I ask you a question? What is the deal between randy and dana? - What do you mean? - He's just awfully friendly with her, don't you think? - Randy's helping her through a difficult part of her life. What's wrong with that? - You need a hat. - I love this! (chuckles) Woo! What do you think? Buenos aires? (chuckles) - yes. - I guess I'll have to wear it on the plane. - How about everything else? Now that you are a newly married woman. - It's great. Well, you know, you live here. - Well, I was referring to other marital things. (laughs) - oh, right. Well, as you know, randy is very fit. - Yes, I noticed. - And vigorous. - Oh! - But... (chuckles awkwardly) ...That vigour hasn't exactly translated to the marital bed. - Well, hey, I'm sure a sexy little number, A picturesque honeymoon... That will change very quickly. Okay, this is not gonna help with the vigour, So this does not go. (laughter) - Those were my favourite! - No. - And you'll take care of tyson while I'm gone? You know he hasn't been without me since tom. - You know I will. - Ooh! And don't forget he has his game on Saturday. - Of course. - And the grocery list is on the fridge. - You got it. - And vitamins at night. - I know, I know. - His vitamins are next to his bed. - Would you get out of here? (ominous music) (vomiting) (panting) (vomiting) (toilet flushes) - Sorry. - Excuse me. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Dana, has randy ever hurt you? Well, I'm just curious if randy has ever exhibited... Symptoms of ptsd? Anything that's dangerous or worrisome? - If he did, I would think his family would support him about it. Why are you living here again? Aren't you, like, in your forties? (tense music) (sighs) - Wow. (chuckles) Wow. My new wife. - Aww. (chuckles) (chuckles) - My new husband. (chuckles) - Cindy. Tonight, I want you... ...To bare your all to me. Will you? - Hmm... I bare my all. - You are mine... (zipper zipping) ...To hold and to feel. Go on. - Hmm... - Say it. Say it.

Say it again. - I bare my all. - Louder. - I am yours to hold and to feel. (moans) When you touch me, I am real. - Yes. - I bare my all. - Ah, yes. - I am yours... - Yes. - ...To hold and to feel. - Yes. - When you touch me, I am real. (tense music) - Ah, shoot. (clatter) (groans in pain) (intriguing music) Oh, my god. So... Okay, how was buenos aires? - Mmm... Wonderful. It's elegant and rich with history and culture. Yeah, it was really fun. - And how about the other marital stuff? Is it accelerating the way that you hoped? - Yeah, it's great. - Good. - How was everything here? - Oh, well, everything with tyson was fine, But there was something weird that happened. - What? - Well... I kinda found this. (ominous music) - Oh. Oh, my god. - I found it in one of randy's camping boxes in the basement. - So, you were snooping through his stuff? - What? No, of course not. - It's kind of a weird thing to just come across. - Well, it's kind of a weird thing To keep in a plastic bag in a box in the basement. I... - You don't have to do that. - Do what? - That. This. You never have anything nice to say about randy, And any opportunity you get to say something bad, You jump all over it! - What would you rather me do? Would you rather me lie about-- - I want you to be happy for me! Please. - Listen, I just don't think that randy is the one. We haven't known him that long. Every single thing I learn about this guy, I mean... Greg is being raised like a soldier. He's so afraid of his father he's wetting the bed. And dana has an eating disorder randy's basically making worse. And what kind of a new husband doesn't want to sleep with his new wife? - Hey, that is my husband you're talking about, okay?! And what do you know about marriage? Or men? Look at you. You're living in my house with my kids and my husband! (tense music) I think it's time you found your own place. I'm sorry. (sighs) (haunting music) (distant sirens wailing) (phone ringing) - Hello. Lori. Oh... Lori baker speaking, I mean. - Lori, it's me. Can you come over right away? - Hey, are you okay? (voice continues) - hold on. What? I'm gonna be right there. (ominous music) - Thanks for coming so quickly. - Yeah, of course, I'm happy to help. Are you okay? Is tyson okay? - Yeah, he's good. I'm good. I'm... I'm sorry, I don't mean to worry you. So... - Yeah, what's going on? - I don't know. You were always so good with cars. I just... Can't get it to start. - Oh, well, did randy take a look at it? - Oh, no. I didn't want to bother him at work. - Okay. Let me check it out. Alright, let's see. - Ah, thanks again. I just... Needed to go to the store, Just, you know, get out of the house, But then, this happened. - Huh. Uh, you know what? Try it now. (engine starts) - You're a life saver. - It was just a fuse that needed to be pushed back in. - Oh. - Maybe it came loose when you went over a bump or something. - Yeah. - Well, hey, I'd really love to see you and tyson more If you maybe wanna grab dinner on Sunday or this week. Anytime, really. Is everything okay? - It's good, I'm good. We're... I'm fine. (chuckles) - Okay. Well, dinner this week? - Yeah, I'll check my calendar. - Okay. Alright, well... I'll see you soon. - See you soon. (car starts) (ominous music) (randy): What are you doing?! (cindy sniffles) Yeah, just what you need, more crap from the store! This isn't even organic. I specifically told you to stay home! Look at this. Here's an idea: More ugly pink garbage. Oh, and a small! That's ambitious! What did I say, huh? What did I say? - Just... - No more bleaching your hair! This crap is filled with chemicals! I am your husband! Doesn't that mean anything to you? Don't you care about yourself? When I tell you to do something, you do it! (ominous music) (water running) (washer and dryer tumbling) Cindy! Cindy, get in here! (sniffles) - Hey. - Where were you? - Just... Laundry. - You know, I was talking to the boys About taking a camping trip this weekend. - I was hoping I could see lori for dinner this Sunday. - I don't think so. (tense music) (radio scratching) (reporter): Lifeguards at lake sammamish Rushed to the aid of a woman drowning, But arrived too late to save the mother of two Swimming at the lake with her husband and children, And what was supposed to be a day of fun and recreation Ended in tragedy. Cynthia baumgartner-roth was later pronounced dead At king county memorial hospital. Hundreds were gathered at the lake, But few saw the tragic event unfold... (dramatic music) Sammamish county received a call around 12:45 Stating a woman was unresponsive At a popular swimming spot. Deputies and first responders Went to the scene and began efforts to save... (broadcast continues) Where she was later pronounced dead on arrival. (ominous music) - We don't cry. We don't ever cry. It's over now. In the marines, we were taught to show no fear. We developed a healthy short-term memory. I'm going to teach you. Okay? You'll be fine. Good. Now, eat up. (sniffles) (door creaking) - I heard on the radio. It's uh... I couldn't believe it. (sobbing) Is it true? - It was her idea to go out to the lake. - What happened? - Boys were playing on the beach, And she asked if we could take the raft out. Thought it'd be romantic, just the two of us. Speed boat went by... And we went over. I was climbing back on... She said something about a cramp... I looked over... She was gone. - Is tyson okay? Can I see? - We watched a movie. He's asleep. I don't want to wake him. Is there anything else? - I don't believe it. - Goodnight, lori. (door creaking) (inhales deeply) - I don't believe you! (eerie music) (sinister music) (sobbing softly) (cindy): He's... He's so charming. Like, this just feels right. I feel like he's the one. (lori): He's keeping his dead wife's ashes In a plastic bag in the basement! - Randy roth's residence. You know what to do. (screams) (dramatic music) (cindy): You're a good friend, lori... (lori): I'm gonna be here for you and tyson. Listen, I promise you... I always will be. (tyson): I always got you, right? (lori): You bet, kid. (gasps, pants rapidly) (tense music) (engine stops) (clattering) - Hey! - Don't hurt me! - Who are you? What are you doing here? - I just... I needed to talk to you. I would have come sooner, but... I hadn't worked up the courage yet. Can I bring my cat inside? - Yeah, sure. - My name is donna clift. - I'm lori. - You're the friend of that woman who drowned. - Did you know cindy? - No. His name is minx. I got him after me and randy divorced. I needed him after everything that happened... Randy tried to drown me. I should have said something! Or done something. I'm so sorry your friend-- - Wait, wait... Hold on. Wait, please. Can you please just start from the beginning? (exhales softly) - I was a divorcee. I met randy at a grocery store. It was actually that little boy of his who asked me out. It was so cute. We were married a few months later. I wanted to get swept up, like some fairy tale princess. (chuckles) Pretty stupid, right? - Not at all. - The moment we got married... The charm was gone. The want of me... Was gone. Then we went on this white-water rafting trip. We were on our own raft. My parents were ahead of us. They rounded this bend in the river... Then he got this look in his eyes, Like he was analyzing me. I could never forget it. And then he... Slammed our raft into these rocks. The raft flooded, we were sinking And I didn't have a vest on and I can barely swim. My dad got there just in time. He pulled me out of the water. Randy apologized, said it was an accident. But I swear he wanted to kill me. - Why didn't you call the police? - And say what? That my husband purposely tried to drown me For no reason whatsoever? My own parents didn't even believe me! (scoffs) - Okay, well, why now? Why call me? - I needed to tell somebody. Because... Because I know he'll do it again. (tense music) (tense music) (sighs) - Boys, get in here! So you two don't want to respect the rules. - I was gonna clean it after... (clattering) - What were you gonna say? Come here. On the line! You stay right there. What do you say? "yes, sir!" - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - You know, it's a good thing I'm here. Because I need to teach you... (clattering) Down on your knees. Down on your knees! Now! Clean this up. I want this floor so clean That you can eat off of it! You hear me? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Argh! - You hear me? (greg grunting) I want this floor spotless. Do you understand? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. (boys groan) - You should know better. (indistinct chatter) - Miss baker? Miss baker, thanks for your patience. How can I help you? - And she swears randy tried to kill her. - And donna clift, she'd be willing To speak with us about this? - She's scared, but she wants to help. - Okay. But you should know the medical examiner Listed cindy's death as an accidental drowning. - You don't know randy. I saw him the night of cindy's death. He was totally unemotional. - People grieve in a lot of different ways. - This wasn't shock, and tyson is still living with him. I have to get him out of there. - You'd prefer he'd live with you? - As opposed to a murderer? He's not safe there! - Miss baker... King county looks into every accidental death To see if there are suspicious circumstances. In this case, there are none. - What about his first wife, janis? Between her and donna, and now cindy, come on! That is a pattern, right? - We'll look into it, ma'am. - I'm really sorry. I wish we could do more. - I told cindy, I promised her That I would take care of her and tyson. And I failed her. But I'm not going to fail her son. - Look, custody usually goes to the other parent, But since cindy and randy only just got married, I'd check and see if there's a preexisting will. Maybe cindy listed a grandparent or someone else To take in her kid. That's what I would do. - Thank you, detective peters. - Soupie. It's sue peters. Soupie. - Soupie. Soupie, please... Look into janis's death. Can you do that? (ominous music) (rustling) - See anything you like? Take whatever you want. It's just garbage. - I went by the bank today. Checked the safety deposit box that cindy and I shared. It was empty. - Lori! - Hey! How are you doing? - Good. - Tell you what, why don't you, uh... Come inside? We're excited to, uh... See an old friend. Would you like a cookie? - There you go, ma'am. - That's it, boys. You can go do your homework with dana. Now... What's all this about a safety deposit box? - I checked the registry. You were the last one to sign it out. - Cindy's my wife. Or... She was. So anything that belongs to her... ...Now belongs to me. - There was a will in there And I know cindy would have made sure That tyson was taken care of. - And he is. - I want tyson back. - Well, that's interesting because... I never thought he was yours to begin with. - I've known him since the day he was born. I'm practically his mother! - But you're not, lori. You're not his mother. You're not his family. - When you look at me... You just see a lonely woman, huh? But I'm not alone. And cindy wasn't the only one you've done this to. - Is that right? So who you've been talking to, lori? Who has lori been talking to? - I'm not afraid of you. - Get out of my house. - Lori! Please don't go. - Oh, sweetheart. I'm so sorry. Listen... Listen to me. Listen, okay? I am gonna come back for you, okay? - Please don't leave. - I promise you... That I'm gonna come back, okay? - Please don't leave... - Listen, listen to me, okay? I promise, okay? I'm gonna come back for you. - Please don't leave. - Tyson! - It's okay... - Don't make me say it again, tyson. - You're doing okay. - Let's go, boys. Oh, and I might just go have a word with your friend. - Just where do you think you're going, young lady? - I'm just going to randy's, I don't get what the big deal is. - The big deal is your mother said you're grounded. - She's not my mother. Randy lost his wife; Greg and tyson lost their mom. They need me. - You get back here right now. (crying) Get back here right now! - I don't know what your problem is. He's your friend! - John! - Stop! - Let go! You're hurting me! - John, stop! Stop, please! We can't! We can't! Please! Please. (panting) Oh, my god! (eerie music) - Hey... Thanks for meeting me halfway. - As soon as you said the name randy roth... I got my keys. - So you remember the case pretty well? - I'll never forget that one. - Minx! Psst, psst! Minx? Minxie cat! Samantha, have you seen minx? - No, mom! - Darned scaredy cat... - Everything here points to an accident. - I never had a shred of hard evidence. But his story kept on changing. Where she was, where he was, how it happened. A couple of us went up and walked the trail. Tried to recreate how it happened. When you called and said another wife had died... In an accident? (scoffs) Let's just say I wasn't surprised. (loud meowing) (tense music) (gasping) (gasping) - There has to be something-- something you can do. - Janis' death is suspicious, But like cindy, the official reports point to an accident. Donna clift won't return my calls. And since randy was legally cindy's husband, He had every right to remove the personal items From the security deposit box. - But he's lying! - Lori, it's not that simple. - Are you a real cop or is that badge just for show? Look, I just... I need to get tyson out of there. - If he finds out that we're investigating him for murder, He might destroy what little evidence is still out there. - So... You do believe that he did it? - Yes, but if I bring this case to a da now, they will kill it. Okay, look... It's not over. We are checking county records to see if cindy filed A copy of the will with the registrar's office. - And if she didn't? - Well, then the only way To get tyson away from randy will be to arrest him, Which we cannot do without more than just circumstantial evidence. (sighs) - John? John, honey? - Ah... I'll go make some... Lemonade? (john sniffles) - I, uh... Sorry about your loss. - Thanks. Uh... But I'm not here about cindy. I'm here about dana. - What about her? - I think that you're not comfortable with dana and randy. - Nah. What about it? I've known randy for years. - And so that makes it okay for him to spend That much time with your teenage daughter? - And just what are you insinuating? - Dana worships randy. She's given herself an eating disorder Just to gain his approval. (scoffs) - I don't even know what you're talking-- - There's something going on here, and I think you see that. I mean, aren't you worried? Can't you see randy is grooming her to be some-- - I'm her father! If anything inappropriate was going on between randy And my daughter, don't you think I'd know about it? And don't you think I'd put a stop to it? I think it's time for you to leave. - Uh... - You're leaving already? (crying): Please don't blame him! John's just... He's just choosing To believe what he wants to believe. - That his friend would never betray him. (sobbing) Dana couldn't stand me when I first moved in. And randy was the only one who could keep the peace. So if there's anyone to blame, it's me. - There is someone to blame, and it is not you, or dana. - She thinks she loves him. So, if... If we demand that she stops seeing him, It will send her running straight into his arms. I don't know what to do. - Then help me. Help me prove that randy's dangerous. Help me get tyson and dana and greg away from him for good. - I... I... I don't know anything. - Yes, you do. You've known him for years. All those women... All those lies... Just tell me what you know. (megan): There was a... There was a fiancée. She was... She was just like the others. Pretty, blonde. Widowed, with kids. Single mom, lonely. Just like cindy. They were always like that. They thought they were getting this charming husband And amazing father, but... That's not what they got. (scoffs) not at all. It was southern, like mary jane or... Mary jo. Yeah. Mary jo philips. (birds chirping) (woman mumbling) - Come on, gang! Let's go! We're late for school! - Mary jo philips? - Yep. Come on gang, let's go. Let's go! - I'm lori baker. I was hoping to speak with you about-- - Sorry, I don't have time for whatever you're selling. - I'm here about randy roth. You two were engaged, right? Was it his son who first asked you out on a date with his dad? - He was... Charming. Thoughtful. He pursued me aggressively and as a single mom with two kids, That felt really good. (chuckles) Honestly, the relationship was amazing until... - Until what? - He asked me about life insurance... His first wife had died in an accident and... He wanted to make sure the kids were taken care of No matter what, but... ...I'd had ovarian cancer. I'm uninsurable. It was after that that he grew distant. I... Thought maybe the fear of marrying another woman He might lose that drove him away. We broke it off within the month. - It wasn't the threat of cancer that drove randy away. And randy's first wife did not die in an accident. Neither did my friend. - So randy was... If I had been insurable, he was going to... Okay. What can I do? - Camping is gonna be so much fun. - Right? I love making s'mores. I mean, a nutritious vegetable sampler... - Where are we going camping again? - Olympia national forest. - Is it true... That there are ghost bears in that forest? - Maybe! - Are you afraid of ghost bears? - No... - Don't worry. Dad will beat them up if they come into our tent. Isn't that right, dad? - You bet, sport! Dana, would you mind finishing loading up the truck? We'll be right back. Thanks. - Hey, ma'am, uh... You're... You're really pretty. You wanna go on a date with my dad? - Greg. Sorry, my son's very forward. Here, let me help you with that. Greg? - Oh, thank you. - I'm randy. Randy roth. - Stacey. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - My car's over here. (chuckles shyly) thanks so much. - You're welcome. (stacey): What's your name? - Greg. Nice to meet you. - You too. I have a son too. His name's liam. - Liam? (tense music) - Soupie, I was about to call you. - You were right. It's the insurance. Randy updated the policy on cindy Before the ink on the marriage certificate was even dry. Same thing with janis. (lori sighs) - So this is-- - this is good. It's motive. But it's not why I'm here. - What is this? - It's cindy's will. She registered it with the county. - What does it say? - I think you should read it. (cindy's voice): In the event of my death, I, cynthia baumgartner, leave all my worldly possessions To my son tyson baumgartner. If he is not of legal guardianship age, I ask that he be put in the custody Of my good friend, lori baker. Lori hasn't just been like family to us... Lori is our family. As such, I designate lori to be the sole executor of my estate, Managing all of my assets, possessions And any insurance compensations, Which are to be put in a trust until my son is of age. - Get the hell off my property! - I'm here for tyson. - He's my boy now. - My lawyer called yours. This is not a negotiation. He's coming with me-- - He needs discipline! He's staying here with me. - Let's go, honey. Tyson's coming with me and he's never coming back here. Come on, honey, let's go. - Tyson, get in the house! - It's okay. - He's not going anywhere. - Move aside, randy! - You're gonna make me? - How about we call the police and we get them here instead? - Tyson, come here. - Do you wanna go with her? Or do you wanna stay here with your family? - I wanna go. (soft piano music) - Come here, sweetheart. Let's get in the car, okay? - Get out of here before I change my mind! (lori's breath trembling) (suspenseful music) (clears throat) - Yes, detective? - Ma'am, I was wondering If you had a chance to look over the files I sent you? On randy roth? - Have a seat, detective. So what do the detectives in your division call my office? - Special operations unit of the deputy prosecutor for king county. The office of last resort, ma'am. - And how many other prosecutors Did you take this case to first? - Quite a few. - And do you know why they didn't take your case? - Well, the evidence is... - Nonexistent. Circumstantial at best. - Yes, ma'am. - Yes. But that's not why they turned down your case. They turned it down because they have no balls. I read your file... Randy roth is a cold-blooded killer, He stalks his prey and baits them with a smile, Flowers, and a marriage proposal. And once he has them chained to eternity, He insures them and kills them. He steals from them and their children. - So? How do you want to proceed with the evidence? - Forget the evidence. He's too smart. We'll never get him that way. No. No, we get this guy by making him think he can win. I will get you a warrant to search his house. You just find me enough that we can hang him with his own lies. We catch him in enough lies... And he'll convince the jury that he's a predator. (chuckles) hell... We might even get a conviction. - No. No. It's my turn now. You are done talking, alright? You listen to me. I've got two kids, a mortgage and a funeral. I need that money now! You hear me! I don't care what some crap piece of paper says. I was her husband. Her... Her soulmate! I need that money now! It's mine! (sirens wailing) - Randy? What's happening? - Take greg to your parents' house. Don't say a word. Not to anyone. Go! You're wasting your time. - We'll see about that. - Okay, guys... Let's tear this place apart! (suspenseful music) - We've got nothing. Nothing! (sighs) (soupie scoffs) - Okay, guys. Let's wrap it up and head home. Thank you. Hey... Uh-uh! We tried. - Yeah. (exhales) (sighs) (chair clattering) (crickets chirping) (tense music) (indistinct whispering) (clears throat) - Please. (exhales) - mr. Roth. I do apologize for the way that you've been treated. There were inconsistencies In what has officially been reported as an accidental death That led my colleagues in the police department To start looking for something That most likely doesn't even exist. Certain people may have overstepped. - You think? - I know. But if you could just be so kind To answer a few questions, I believe that we can just clear this matter up today. - Certainly. Whatever you ladies need. - Thank you. (crying) (knocking on door) - dana? - Someone's here to see you. - Hey, dana. Hey, greg. - Greg, honey, why don't you come with me? (tense music) - So, your previous relationship, With mary jo philips. Did that end organically? - It just wasn't a good match. She was really the one who ended things. - Okay. But you were married prior to that, correct? To donna clift? Why did that end? - Donna's kid and my son greg just didn't get along. Donna's a lovely woman, but you know, It just didn't make sense to stay together. Especially when there's disharmony in the home. - Oh yeah, I can imagine. - I'm sorry to ask. My brothers both served... But we heard you were struggling with some post-traumatic stress? - Sometimes. But that's the cross we bear to protect this great country. I just hope you ladies never have to see those types of things. - Well, thank you for your service. - Yes, absolutely. - He was in the marines. He was a file clerk in north carolina. He was never in combat. He never even left the country. (dana sniffles) - Do you know what this is? - A promise ring? (sniffles) - randy promised me... He promised me that he would marry me As soon as I was old enough. He told me he loved me! - No... - No, he promised me! - Listen, dana. - He promised me... - You did nothing wrong. Do you hear me? Nothing! Oh, honey, it's going to be okay. - So, your relationship with cynthia, it was good then? - Our marriage? It was perfect. - You and cindy were in the honeymoon phase still? - Oh, for sure. I was very happy. And cindy, she was... Oh, she was ecstatic. Over the moon. Yeah, we were deeply in love right up until... (voice breaking): I'm sorry... (soft music) - Mom, dad... - Come here, baby. - I'm so sorry. - Thank you. - You'll take care of greg? - Of course. (crying) - Mr. Roth, I would like to read you a passage From cynthia's diary. She made two entries the day before she died. And the first one, mr. Roth... ...The first one is to you. "randy does not love cindy. Randy hates cindy. Randy hates cindy's makeup, her blonde hair. He hates her cold fingers, her ugly toes. Randy hates the things she wears, And everywhere she goes. He hates her favourite colour, pink. He hates to even watch her drink. He hates the way she wakes from bed. His every look fills her with dread." Now... That doesn't sound like a woman who's "over the moon." Does it? - Mr. Roth. Can you explain the nature of your relationship With your friend's daughter, dana carlson? (sighs) - What are they doing here? (exhales sharply) - They're here to make their statements. (soupie): Let's get you back to your cell. Better get comfortable in there. (ethereal music) (indistinct chatter) (cindy's voice): In this dream, I never wake. Tragedy now becomes my fate. For I am with you always. A mother's love never subsides. I dream to hug you, kiss you, touch you. To hear your heartbeat just once more. Until we meet again, my child, I love you forevermore. - Is everything okay? - I'd like to read you something from your mom. Is that okay? "to my beloved son, tyson. I have this dream, I lie in sombre..." (music swelling)
