Oh? Go on. Do you notice anything unusual? No. Sorry. At first, I thought this was just a fault in the film. It was a strange coincidence. Then it happened again. Interesting, don't you think? And this... I took on the day that you were at the rugby match. - Same thing. - Only it's more pronounced this time... and it's actually making contact with the body. And the rest, ofcourse— history. I can't explain it. And that's why I started digging. The coroner's report shows that he was riddled with cancer... high on morphine most ofthe time. - Injected himselftwo or three times a day. - He knew that he was dying? Apparently, yes. He said that he wanted to be forgiven by Christ. Externally, his body was perfectly normal... except for one small thing in the inside of his right thigh. - What is it? - Three sixes. 666. - Concentration camp? - That's what l thought. But the biopsy says it's a birthmark. The best is yet to come. Pages ofthe Bible— thousands ofthem. Every inch ofwall space covered, even the windows. He even needed to be close to his church. There are 47. l counted them. I think he was trying to keep something out. Don't you? The police thought he was insane, so they didn't mind me coming here... and rummaging around to see if l could find anything of use. The first item... is a diary. It didn't say anything about him. It's about you— what time you left the house... where you went, what restaurants you had your lunch in... what time your speaking engagements were. The last entry says that he was supposed to have met you in Bishop's Park... and that was dated the day he died. But the really important items are here. lfwe're to get to the bottom ofthis, we've got to start here. This first clipping is from the Astrologer's Monthly. It reports an unusual phenomenon— a comet changing shape into a glowing star... like the Star of Bethlehem 2,000 years ago. Only this one was on the other side ofthe world— the European continent— five years ago. The sixth ofJune, to be exact. Does that date mean anything to you? Yes. Then you'll recollect this other clipping. It's a birth announcement from a Rome newspaper... also dated the sixth ofJune, five years ago— the day your son was born. Sixth month, sixth day. Was your son born at 6:00 a.m.? Yes, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to work out this birthmark— the three sixes. My son is dead. I don't know whose son I'm raising. lfyou wouldn't mind, Mr. Thorn, l'd like to help you try and find out. No. It's my problem. No, sir, you're wrong. It's my problem too. When l came here with the police, l took some photographs. I happened to catch sight of my own reflection in that mirror. I know you must think I'm crazy, but I'm so frightened. Don't be afraid. You'll be all right here. You'll be perfectly all right. Oh. Some all right. What about Damien? I'll speak to Mrs. Horton. She'll look after him. Mrs. Horton. Mrs. Horton? - Mrs. Baylock. - Sir? - Where's Mrs. Horton? - Gone. - Gone out? - No, no. They've gone. Theyjust got up and went. They left an address foryou to send their last month's wages to. Didn't Mrs. Horton say anything? - Didn't Horton leave any explanation? - No. But don't worry, sir. l can manage. - I'll look into this when l get back. - Just as you wish, sir. - And, Mrs. Baylock. - Sir? Last night, I saw that dog in Damien's room. - I clearly told you— - He's gone now, sir. They took him away this morning. No. No. This is the right address. Apparently, there was a terrible fire and the old hospital burned down. Five years ago. - [ Italian ] - Okay. Well, surely the fire didn't destroy everything. - There must have been some records. - [ Speaking ltalian ] I sorry. I think everything was destroyed. Isn't it possible that there were some papers stored elsewhere? - I do not know, signore. - Sister. This is most important to me. I adopted a child here. l'm searching for some records of- - There were no adoptions here. - There was one. - No, signore. - It wasn't an actual adoption. - You are "mistake." - Wait. Birth records. - lf l gave you a date, an exact date. - No. - No. - lt's no use. The fire started in the hall of records, in the basement. All the paperwork was there— went up like a torch. Shot up the stairwells. The third floor became an inferno. - The third floor? - The nursery and maternity wards. - Nothing left but ashes. - You will excuse me, uh? - What about the staff? - Hmm? - Surely some survived. - Sí, some. There was a tall man, a priest— dark eyes, piercing eyes. Ah, sí! Padre Spiletto. - Yes. - Hewas principale. - Yes, he was in charge. Is he— - Yes, he is alive. - ls he here? - No. - Where? - He's in a monastero in... Frosinone. Many were taken there. Many die. Perhaps he is die since, but he lived through the fire. I remember. People say itwas un miracolo. Frosinone? Sí. Il Monastero di San Domenico. - Mille grazie, signora. - Prego. - Here we are. - What is it? - "When theJews return to Zion" — - That's it— the poem. "When theJews return to Zion." And there was something about a comet. Yes. That's here too. The shower ofstars and the rise ofthe Roman Empire. These are supposed to be the events that signal the birth ofthe Antichrist— the devil's child. [Jennings ] It's making more sense. TheJews have returned to Zion, and there has been a comet. And as for the rise ofthe Roman Empire... scholars think that could well mean the formation ofthe Common Market. - The Treaty of Rome. - Bit of a stretch. Well, what about this? ln Revelations, it says... "He shall rise from the eternal sea." Well, that's the poem again— "From the eternal sea, he rises... creating armies on either shore"— That was the beginning of it. And theologians have already interpreted the "eternal sea"... as meaning the world of politics— the sea that constantly rages with turmoil and revolution. So the devil's child will rise from the world of politics. Looks like this is as far as we go. Let's have a look. Found him? His mind is active, but, since the fire, he has not made a sound. We feed him and take care of his needs. - And we pray for his recovery when his penance is completed. - What penance? "Woe to the shepherd who abandons his sheep. May his right arm wither and his right eye lose its sight." He's fallen from grace. Can you tell us why? For abandoning Christ. - How do you know he's abandoned Christ? - He told us. But he doesn't speak. There is some movement in his left hand. He was able to write it down. You will notice the curved line over the head. This indicates the hood ofthe monk— his own hood. - The three sixes. - Six is the sign ofthe devil. But why three ofthem? We believe it signifies the diabolical trinity: the devil, Antichrist and false prophet. Father, Son and Holy Ghost, huh? For everything holy, there is something unholy. This is the essence oftemptation. Father Spiletto. My name is Thorn. There was a child. I want to know where that child came from. - I am afraid this is— - You confessed to them. Now confess to me. - What happened? - Please, signore. You said you knew its mother. - Where is she now? - I must insist that you do not— I beg you. Where is she? Answer me! - Answer! - [ Bell Tolling Loudly ] Excuse me. "Cervet." Please. Does it mean something to you? Cerveteri. It is an old cemetery from Etruscan times. Cripta Sant'Angelo. lt is nothing but ruins. - Where is this place? - But, signore, there is nothing there. Only graves. - Where is it? - You will find it on the map. It is perhaps 50 kilometers north of Rome. Robert. Over here. "Maria... Scianna." My God. "June 6." Five years ago. "Bambino Scianna." Infant boy. Same date. "In birth and death, the generations embrace." Is my son... buried here? This woman could be the mother ofthe child you adopted. Why here... in this terrible place? - [ Exclaims ] - My God. - The other one. - No. Let's get out of here. lf it's an animal, too... then maybe my child... is alive somewhere. They murdered him.

There's some excavation going on there. If only you could remember the name ofthe man you're supposed to see. It's Bugenhagen. He was an exorcist. I read about him. That was his name, and l remember the poem. "When theJews return to Zion... "and a comet fills the sky... "and the Holy Roman Empire rises... "then you and l must die. "From the eternal sea, he rises... "creating armies on either shore... "turning man against his brother... till man exists... no more." Kathy is dead. I want Damien to die too. [ Man ] Hello, Mr. Thorn. I am Bugenhagen. [ Robert ] What is this place? The city ofJezreel. Town of Megiddo. The place... where Christianity began. The little priest, is he dead yet? Yes. Come along, Mr. Thorn. We had better get to work. Oh, you will excuse us. This is for Mr. Thorn alone. All right. It must be done on hallowed ground. A church. His blood must be spilled on the altar of God. This first knife... is most important. It extinguishes physical life... and forms the center ofthe cross. The subsequent placings extinguish spiritual life... and should radiate outward... like this. This is not a human child. Make no mistake. - Is there proof? - Oh, yes. He bears a birthmark— a sequence of sixes. So, says the Bible, do all the apostles of Satan. - He doesn't have it. - He must have it. I've bathed him. I know every inch of him. lf it is not visible on the body... it will be beneath the hair. Remove it. You must be devoid of pity. - And the woman? - She is an apostate of hell. She will die before permitting this. Look, I want to know what he said. I have a right to know. Robert, I want to know what he said! l'm notjust some bystander! l was the one that found him! I'm the one that's supposed to kill him. These are knives. He wants me to stab him! - He wants me to murder a child. - It's not a child. How can he know that? Maybe he's wrong. It's insane! I won't have anything to do... with murdering a little boy. He's not responsible. I won't do it! Well, ifyou don't do it, I will. - ♪♪ [ Choir Chanting ] - Oh, God! Run, Damien! Run! Uh!
