Costumes: Music: Cameraman: ls that him ? Yes my count, him. Unfortunately he's not alone on board. Don't see our friends, Wan Stiller. Hauls the corpses everywhere, displayed like some hunting trophies. He should arrive at Maracaibo in 2 hours. Wish my brothers would arrive in time. - Amedeo ! Enrico ! - Amedeo, my brother ! - Loyal Wan Stiller. - And yours, Carmauxi. - Where is Emilio ? - Hasn't arrived yet. Strange. Your brother usually arrives first. This time will arrive as third. His delay worries me. Saw well-armed Spanish galleon set sail. lf she were to encounter the "Lightning". Emilio would likely attack. ''The Lightning'' lf Wan Gould is heading for Maracaibo, so must l. You and Wan Stiller wait here for Emilio. Then go to Maracaibo. - Let's go ! - Emilio told us to meet here. lt is his plan. He must tell us what next. - That's unimportant. l go ! - ls too ! Stay ! Amedeo, realize l'm older than you, you must obey me. But Emilio is eldest, we must obey him. So l am right. - Carmauxi, which one of us is right ? - You, captain. - Wan Stiller, who is right ? - You, my count. Well then, give me a coin. Let fate decide. - Heads or tails ? - Tails. - l heads. - Wait. l'll take heads. - Then l tails. No, l'll take tails. - Decide already. - Yes, heads. Tails ! How is that possible, you always win ? You cheat ! Lady Luck smiles upon Enrico of Ventimiglia. l repeat, governor will not admit you. Why insist on convincing yourself ? - l heard about your new pet. - Beautiful animal, Maracaibo's finest. The duke Wan Gould. His excelency, governor of Maracaibo. Lord Ribeira de Aguanita, and Alcantar, and Mendez, and Lopez, and Mendoza... Enough with titles, in a moment none will matter. How dare you ? Do you know who l am ? Here are my credentials, authorized by the king of Spain himself. Forgive me. This makes you the viceroy. And l will exercise my power to its fullest. Done Ribeiro, you represent Spain. Largest and most powerful empire on Earth. And what have you accomplished so far ? Savage natives roam about... Shipping lanes are unsafe. Pirates rule the seas and enrich themselves with our gold. This demands firm action. We must hunt down and eliminate every last one of them. l gave my word to the Spanish throne it shall be done. My word ! l will implement it in your stead. - l heard fruits are healthy. - Alfonso Hernandez de la puente Xenovia. Donna lsabella de Leon, marquise de Barmejo. What a creature, she would sell herself for a slice of bread. After she became the governor's mistress, now all must bow before her. Count Don Rafael Lopez de Alechante. - lsabella ! - Yes ? Funny how we share the same name... ... and same title - both marquises. We seem to share many things. Perhaps one too many, my dear. So true. Alas. We were waiting for you, commander. - Where are my brothers ? - ln Maracaibo. And Wan Gould ? - Maracaibo. - Why didn't they wait for me ? You know your brothers. So much shooting, over an hour now. Sounds like a skirmish between the Spanish soldiers and natives. - You call that a skirmish ? - Well... lt is a massacre of unarmed people. Should we help them, commander ? No. Tonight l must settle the score with Wan Gould. Must proceed to Maracaibo. After all, isn't prudent to leave those two hotheads of mine unsupervised. What are you staring at ? Haven't seen Flamingos before ? What are those ? Stop joking, we are Wan Gould's soldiers. - Mamma mia, l'm frightened ! - Drink for courage, little girl. No, he mustn't. His doctor advised against it. That is insult ! - Leave him to me. - No way, he insulted me, you heard. - But l'm older. - Doesn't matter. - Alright, heads or tails ? - Tails. Heads. Unbelievable. Still haven't won a single... Let's go. Okay hero, let's test your swordsmanship. First, l'll cut off your nose ! Did you say nose ? Stop your fun. Crew report back to the ship. We set sail at dawn. Wan Gould is preparing to leave. Must be either tonight, or never. Grab your guns, and say your prayers. Wan Gould must wait. We cannot abandon those who need us most, here and now. Yes, commander. lf you say pirates are everywhere, are we safe ? l will defend you. Women owe much to the hierarchy, after all, council of Nice declared women have souls as well. Albeit l admit tis not a woman's soul l appreciate the most. What a relief, as my soul is the one thing l refuse to share. Count Amedeo of Roccabruna, lord of Ventimiglia and Valpenta, called Green Pirate. Count Enrico of Roccabruna, lord of Ventimiglia and Valpenta, called Red Pirate. Duke Wan Gould, l recognize you. Duke Wan Gould, 1 0 years ago l was a boy. You betrayed our parents who regarded you as friend, murdered them, robbed them, while Spanish flag gave you immunity. Ten years we lived for one purpose - avenge our parents. Very reason we became pirates. Sailed from distant ltaly, pursuing you. Ten years, but finally we caught up with you. l cannot express myself as well as my brother, but lf devil has a name, it is yours. And now, defend yourself, accursed murderer ! ln my opinion, you must be mad. How do you expect to leave here, alive ? Our purpose is vindication. Whether we leave is unimportant. Our fate is not as important, your Excellency, as the death of this man. Which first ? Or both ? - He is mine. - No, mine ! Tails ! Lady luck deserted you this time, Enrico. Enrico... l... Amedeo ! - Stabbed him in the back. Cowards ! - Arrest him ! Yet another murder ! Wan Gould ! Yara ! Yara ! You enjoy death ? Here, have some ! Come on, you wretches ! Pardon me, senor. Come. Attack ! There is only three of them ! As in a Trinity ! ln the name of the king ! Attack, in the name of God and Spain ! Amen ! Should we go after them, commander ? No. Let's search for survivors instead. Sometimes l am ashamed of being white man. Who are they ? Each was half of my heart. My brothers. Yara's heart died with them. l understand your anguish. l too have two brothers. You saved Yara's life. Her life will now join yours. Her soul abides in you. From now on you will hear all that Yara hears. Will see, all that Yara sees. Same man killed my heart as yours. Off to Maracaibo ! Here little monkey. Don't be afraid. Order by the governor ! Have it right here, black on white. l must examine these two pirates. We are after all dealing with an entirely different offshoot of the human race. - Are you an alchemist ? - No, a student of science. - He is the doctor of Maracaibo. - l will come for their bodies in 2 hours. Who is this ? Nice looking indian. Nice, but wild. Felt lonesome, so she came seeking company. What do you want ? To punish you ! - Who is your commander ? - The Flamingos. Lower them down. ... or l will hang you. Friends, hear me. l swear not rest until l avenge my brothers, murdered by the traitorous duke Wan Gould. l swear to Satan ! Mighty ruler of demons, l swear ! Help me, and l will forfeit my soul ! Let lightning strike my ship, and sink us to the depths of the ocean, unless l find Wan Gould and wipe out his clan as he has mine. lnto the tranquil ocean's depths. My brothers, if you can hear me where ever you are, bid me your final farewell. Same revenge you swore, swears Yara for her brothers. l too bid farewell. Do you hear it too ? Yes. Perhaps the wind ? A three-mast ship ! lt is a galleon ! Spanish at that ! First gift the devil sent me. Ready for attack ! Guns ! Get ready ! Ready grappling hooks. Raise sails ! Prepare for battle ! Cast the hooks ! Attack ! Before blood of your men stains my saber, do you wish to fight me first ? By rank. You next, sub commander. We are here ! Sailors, move it ! Surrender ! Ship is ours. Wan Stiller, take care of everything. Yes, commander. Take ten of your men, and sail the galleon to Tortuga behind us. Search below, move all gunpowder aboard our "Lightning". You fought gallantly and valiantly. That saved your lives. l value honest brave men. You shall have a raft and supplies, sail where you wish. And, it is my duty to inform you of two other passengers. - Who ? - A countess and her chamber maid. Hear that men ? We are in the company of a lady ! Couldn't get any sleep last night. Forgive us, gracious lady. Among unavoidable aspects of attacking ships is noisy ruckus. Our ship was attacked ? - Yes my lady, by pirates. - Oh, my Lord ! And who won ? The pirates. And l'm their leader. My Lord ! That doesn't mean l am not a gentleman. l assure you no harm will come to you nor your chambermaid. May l ask your name ? - They call me the Black Pirate. - Hear that ? A worse fate could not have befallen us. Fear not my lady, he claims to be gentleman, surely will prove it by granting us liberty. Unfortunately, l do not decide alone, rather is up to my entire crew as well. - Will any of you dare touch me... - No, no, no, calm down. l protect both my men and you. Your freedom will have to be purchased at the slave market in Tortuga our pirate island. We arrive in three days. Might l know your fair name ? l am Honorata Villerman, duchess of Weltrendrem. And this girl is my chambermaid. Ready, we sail ! That Villerman duchess from Weltrendrem is here. Am glad you accepted my invitation, duchess. Sit down, please. Thank you. Forgive me but l asked the duchess to sit here, not you. Your place is there. - What is the meaning ? - But dear lady, you are the duchess, and she is your maid. Do you think l did not realize it right away ? l understand you did it to protect your duchess from possible harm. l will sit at your table only because l have no choice... And, what of my pretense, you are no different, pretending to be a gentleman. Are you always this brazen ? lf l had a gun or a sword, l would be even more so. Moko. Serve the ladies. Would you like some wine ? Here. Your men seem to be more of a nuisance than servants. l admit that, but they are basking in victory. Evidently. Your wine glasses and dinning utensils are exquisite. From Whom did you steal them ? And why could l not take back from them what they took from me ? Please, for a moment, forget our social standings. You are very beautiful. l don't recall last time l dined in such lovely company. What happened ? ls a storm brewing ? No. That is no storm. How lucky l didn't reveal your true identity. Why consider it fortunate ? Your name among pirates is the most despised. Who knows what might have been had he learned you are the daughter of Wan Gould. l don't think the name Wan Gould would affect his behavior towards me. No brother Antonio. Not quite it. Oh, it is you, duke. ln my opinion, color of her eyes is bit faded. Don't you think ? ln reality my daughter's skin is more pale. A little romance might add rosiness to her cheeks. And her nose... her nose... to say, a bit impertinent. Understand what l mean ? l understand above all, that you love her. More than anything in the world. And still l received no news about the ship taking her to Maracaibo. We must trust in God. He should trust in me ! - Whose sparrows are these ? - Olonese's. l have a special on them, on the condition you can eat them all in one night as l once did. - Whose is she ? - The Black Pirate's. Which Black Pirate ? The count ? That defender of the weak ? He doesn't belong among us, doesn't even want many dealings with us. Don't touch this lady, or else. Who is this man challenging me ? One of oldest Castile families. His ransom was just paid, he is free. lf he's paid for, l figure l could kill him now. My dear chap, you are so stupid, l'd love to whip some sense into you with my foil. Unfortunately l'm disposed of my equipment. But no matter, just lend me a sword, l'll give you a free lesson. Unless you're afraid of an armed man. Give him a weapon ! From now on, this man is under my protection, Olonesi. Try your tricks on me. Catch ! Forgive me for interfering so loudly, in such ''atypical'' Tortuga manner, but doesn't seem appropriate for two pirates to fight amongst themselves. - A night before a major undertaking. - What are you talking about ? - Did you not speak with the Emir ? - With emir ? Who can understand him ? Try yourself if you don't believe me. More languages one speaks, further one gets. So what did he say ? That perhaps you are strong as a lion, but head is empty. You conquered his sailing ship with crew, but his cargo ship, sailing behind him, headed for Maracaibo with treasures, you let slip away. What did she fare ? He said, approximately 4 tons of pure gold and five tons of silver. His throne was overthrown at home, so he was fleeing to America with the national treasure. - And who are you ? - My name is Morgan. Never heard of you. - Give me time. - What land are you from ? - England, hopefully you heard of it ? - And what they call you, Milton ? - Morgan. - No one will remember that. Maybe yes. Thank you. Your hand is no doubt the hand of aristocrat. Blue blood knows its own. l can confidently lean on it. You are mistaken, my lord. My hand is ordinary like Olonese's. lt became pirate's hand for time being. l fear, it is the only kind l have to offer for support. Lean on me. Free this woman, she belongs to me. l paid for her. Jean David Knoll, as governor of Tortuga, acting on behalf of the French king, l need to learn more about your plan to attack Maracaibo. Before giving my assent, l wish to hear views of those present. DeCailloux, speak. Four tons of gold, l would reach into fires of hell to retrieve it. Gold, or die trying, such is my view. l have two ships and 200 hands, all can be ready in 2 days. Who knows how many will lose our lives, perhaps even you Olonesi. But it's an opportunity l don't wish to waste. lf you die, that'll prove l'm bravest among all pirates ! But l will go. - Van Horn ? - l go. Under the condition Olenesi will allow us to work out the plan together. Martin Hoffer ? Why do you ask me ? Though l'm an ex-priest, don't think it'll bother me to send some Spaniards back to their Maker. Count from Ventimiglia. - We are not going. Me nor my men. - You ? Are you pirate or Spaniard ? You are more on their side than ours. We must conquer Maracaibo ! There's lots of gold, and l want it ! l am in charge, you must obey me. You must go as well. l won't go to Maracaibo with your flotilla, Olonesi. - Because l will be there first. - l think you are mad. Our goals differ, yours is gold, Wan Gould mine. lf you attack Maracaibo and the duke won't be able to repel you, he will flee. l must be there first. lf l remain alive when you arrive, l will join you then. You made it to Maracaibo alone, once, tempting fate trying for a second time ? l only need to ensure the duke won't escape alive. Even if you make it to Maracaibo, how do you expect to find him ? l will find him. l made a bargain with a potent ally. Good luck. Emilio ! Aim straight. And hold firm... Excellent ! Moko, bring me the man waiting outside. - Which one, the one playing the flute ? - No, the other one. - You ! Come here. - What manners. Why do you follow me ? - So that you would call for me. - But why ? l am just beginning my pirate's career, and need to be hired as a captain. l'd rather have my own command, but that seems unlikely at this time. What did you say your name was ? Morgan. See, even you cannot remember it. l need to do something noteworthy, for people to remember my name. Back to matter at hand, what do you want from me ? - Take me to Maracaibo. - Why should l ? Because we have overlapping interests, on which l rely as you upon your honor. Nice speech. But not enough of an incentive. Perhaps l will think of more... Wan Gould. l managed to find his servant among the prisoners. He mentioned certain monastery the duke frequents, alone. Offer the chap freedom, and he will take you there. - And where is this man ? - Waiting outside. You heard me Satan, at last. Welcome to my home. Forgive l ordered my men to bring you. Keep your pretentious sincerity, stop talking like nobleman when you are just a criminal. l'd rather stab myself than be your property. ln vain you spent your gold piece, you merely purchased a corpse. Wait a moment ! Before you do yourself in, l merely wanted to let you know that you are free. Leave at your convenience. My men have orders to take you wherever you wish. l paid your purchase price merely to give you back your freedom. No treasure can equal your worth. And l don't mean as if men could never buy women's hearts with wealth. Tomorrow l leave Tortuga. l wanted to apologize, for everything, and bid you farewell. l gazed upon you and said in my heart, l gained all l desired, and took whatever l pleased, but this lady can never be mine. And yet, as if my soul has always longed for you. You have no idea how many times l told myself he's merely an assassin, a pirate. And my heart replied: He's part of your destiny ! He has the best and noblest heart. Wanted to run from you, yet everything in me screamed ''return !'' Return to him, embrace him ! Love him ! Might have been better had you fled. Forgive me... and forget me. l cannot join my destiny with yours. l made a terrible vow, and to fulfill it, l must do so alone. That is why you must leave, my love. Have you ever seen a ship like "Lightning", captain... Morgan, l'm called Mor-gan. - Yes, captain... - They will never remember the name. Don't give up hope. Prepare to change heading ! What is your name ? - Yara. - l am Jose. - Why do you hate me, Yara ? - Who said l hate you ? - l see it in your eyes. - l hate all Spaniards. Did the Spanish do something horrible ? But not all Spaniards are bad. Just as not all are good. You shouldn't hate all, just those who hurt you. Why should Yara say ''These l hate, those l don't.'' They came from the sea, from Spain to kill us. Stole our land, made us slaves. They didn't ask themselves which of us are good and which are bad. lf l could, l would wipe them all off the face of the Earth. But you are already making distinctions. Because you are speaking with me, shows you hate me little bit less. Sometimes we just need to talk, and no longer are we lndian or Spaniard, just two ordinary human beings. But l'm no longer anything anymore. How did you get here ? l asked Carmaux and Wan Stiller to hide me. Carmaux ! Wan Stiller ! Come here, immediately ! - Must say our farewell now, Carmauxi. - Seems so, Wan Stillere. l begged them so much... Tis my fault, don't punish them. - Commander ? - Gentlemen. Thank you. Now go. Could you believe we weren't particularly eager to answer your call ? Was thinking day and night how to say ''no'' to your farewell, how to persuade you, how to resist you. Only solution l came up with was to disobey you. l would never demand your obedience, only ask for your love. When l lived in ltaly with my brothers and family, l believed honor was based on what one learned. ln adhering to rules laid down by the nobility, social duties, maintaining the family honor. Then l discovered that's not the only way to live. ln Tortuga l found new life, new rules, new sense of honor. Not always better, not always worse, just different. And then you came. Because of you, l discovered a new life. Totally different life. My determination for revenge seemed to wane. lf l could only erase entire past from my memory. But cannot. l made a vow l must keep. l understand. My family, my father, all taught me honor is all in life, without it we are nothing. Had l suffered what you have, l too would vow revenge. l understand perfectly. That is why l feel closer, and love you, all the more. This is why. As God is my witness, l desire to partake in your destiny forever. Regardless, to remain with you. What is the matter ? You look upon me with ever greater sadness. Why ? Because l see, what will happen. And it will be very distressing. Not through my fault l hope ? - This is my first officer, captain Morgan. - l'm very pleased. Attention ! All together now ! Holy Mother of Guadalupe ! Never would have thought to see daughter of Wan Gould on this ship. How do you know she is Wan Gould's daughter ? l saw her miniature once, while in duke's service. At least she resembles it. But l could be mistaken. Are you daughter of Wan Gould ? Don't lie. Yes. But that is no crime ? lt is here. Men, listen. The night we buried my brothers at sea, l vowed to wipe out Wan Gould's family as he wiped out mine. l even invoked Satan for help, and he answered me. ln his usual diabolical style. He delivered into my hands the daughter of Wan Gould. The only woman l could ever love. And now my heart trembles in horror. l want to annul the terrible vow. Commander, 1 0 years you fight against Wan Gould, with us faithfully by your side. Because of you, each of us lost a friend, or even own brother or son. You taught us to hate Wan Gould with same intensity as yours. You don't decide alone. We all want to take revenge on that accursed scoundrel. - Death to Wan Gould's clan ! - Death ! - Eye for an eye - Execute her ! Death ! Revenge ! - Death ! - Death ! lt is decided. Honorata Wan Gould, for crimes of your father, you are sentenced to death. Judgment to be carried out immediately. lf you have something to say, speak now else forever be silent. lf devil is punishing you for your vow. God is punishing me for mine. Excuse me, commander. l'm here only short time, but the only one not directly involved in your vendetta. l realize you must keep your vow, but, please let me speak... Hear me brothers. l don't wish to challenge your judgment, but exercising my authority as the ship's first officer l invoke the laws of the sea, recognized by all sailors and flotillas. l wish to suggest, leave the execution of your judgment to fate. - l second that. - l agree. Agreed. According to laws of the sea ! So shall it be done. So l must perish. My soul will depart your heart like this ? Lower the life raft. Behold, even the Black Pirate weeps. Changing of the guard ! lf the accursed pirates come, we are ready. Guards were doubled. Your plan was truly ingenious, duke Wan Gould. We let the pirate ships approach, but offer little resistance. And when in reach of our canons, then we let them have it. Are you even listening to me ? No. l am thinking of the news a friend is to bring me any time now. lf you wish, you can receive him here in the palace. No, in the monastery instead. Jose, where are you ? Where are we supposed to go ? Dominican monastery. The duke goes there to pray every day, by himself. - But l think we should split up. - Why ? Our number might arouse suspicion. Would be best if the two of us would go alone. ln short, you take care of Wan Gould, l'll take care of emir's gold ! - Silver too. - Leave a little for Olonese. Yara ! Good bye, Yara. We will return shortly. Why are you bidding me farewell, when l'm going with you. What ? The Black Pirate and l made the same vow. l too must avenge my brothers. - Your eyes don't seem clear today. - Because l worry about you, Yara. Don't come with us. l'd rather die than break my vow. Let's go, we're wasting time. Don't stop, Jose ! Which way ? Perhaps here. Why don't you say what you see in my eyes ?! What is the meaning of this? That l betrayed you all. l was to lure you into a trap. Wan Gould is waiting with his soldiers. For this you pay with your life ! l am ready. Kill me. Could you take me to the duke without him suspecting ? Of course ! - But be warned ! - l will never betray you again. - Just try, and you die. - l won't. l learned to admire you. l fell in love with the people of Tortuga. All your people, especially... Basically, all your people. Can trust him now, his eyes are clear again. Perhaps luck abandoning Wan Gould is a good sign. Praise the Lord. Repeat. We lost their trail. Wait. - What is this comedy of yours ? - Wait, you'll see. Forgive me stranger. Uh, dear foreigner, l just, Wanted, That is, l mean... ... what the hell are you doing ? Maracaibo is threatened by dangerous epidemic. - No ?! - Yes ! lf you please... - How did it get here ? - Emir's treasure brought it's infected. - No ?! - Yes ! And this is the only cure. lt's from the Orient. Being the only doctor here, it is in people's interest that l be saved first. Please tell me what to do. Similar incident happened years ago in Damascus... and this powder... What ?! lt ls imperative to sprinkle entire emir's treasure and all who touched it ! When they were hiding it, someone must have touched it, understand ? Don't scream if you hold life dear. Move over little. Have no intention to harm you. Don't force me. Force you ? Please don't hurt me. Put the candlestick down. A drop of hot wax on your hand, and you might not resist a scream. And you please put aside your sword. What if l were to sneeze ? Alright, but promise you won't scream. Agreed. Even if you might not believe my word, l assure you l have no intention of dying, l truly won't scream. Better. lntend to stay long ? Until he comes. l surmise you are very secretive, and enchanting. But l know very well who you are. You are whom they call the Black Pirate. - You wish to confront Wan Gould ? - On his account l sold my soul. l tore out my heart, at a time it beat the strongest for my beloved. May the Lord have mercy on me. l witnessed how the duke killed your brothers. lt was a cowardly murder. He killed both of them in a despicable manner. l knew many men, but none like Wan Gould. He is obsessed, as if consumed by unquenchable fire. l came to extinguish it once and for all. Mannere ! - What is happening ? - l am returning from my watch. l saw sails on the horizon. They are pirates' ! At last. Give marquise a message, not to wait for me tonight. Then come to the fortress, we'll be there. First night l spent looking a man in his eyes. Might be a nice story to tell my grandchildren if l ever had some. But they would never believe me. The duke ? No. The duke would knock more discretely. l have a message for the marquise from duke. - Captain ! - What, Manolo ? Moment ago l thought l heard voices and footsteps in the marquise's room. We must investigate. My lady ? Yes, Manolo ? Captain Mannere has a message from duke. Go away all of you, l have a headache. Your servants seem very obedient. Much too much l would say. Shame to have to kill some. What ? Have any idea how much each one costs these days ? Could you please escape in a less expensive manner ? - But l would need your help. - You have it. To start, embrace me. Gladly. l must admit l wanted to all along. Don't shoot, he'll kill me ! Allow him to pass. Prepare a coach ! Put down the guns for goodness' sake ! One shot will kill me ! lt's the Black Pirate ! Don't shoot ! Let him escape, for her sake. Didn't move all night long. lt is a ploy. Feigning an attack from the sea. Real battlefield will be the fortress. That is where we wait for them. We give the order, then attack from behind. Let's go. l wish to inspect the fortress walls. lf some day l will have grandchildren, l will tell them of tonight, and you. Better go. Sun is rising. That is the hour when fairytales end. Duke and his officers keep inspecting the fortress. Shall we go ? We shall. After so many years, so many deaths, we finally meet face to face. Perhaps your sword is faster than mine, but surely is not faster than Shutz's. For years l kept him by my side, expecting this moment. Shutz ! Perhaps you are honorable man, but your duke sent you to certain death this time. They attacked ! Mannere, back into the fortress ! Ready all your men to fight ! - Follow me ! - Duke is retreating ! l will stop him ! These are your final moments. Rid me of those two. Yara ! Yara ! Yara ! Yara ! Men are ready, Olonesi. Half a ton of gold waits for us on the other side of these walls. - Let's take it ! - Attack ! More than half our men will be killed before they reach the walls... Who said so ? Remember, tiger is successful animal because he is ruthless. l sent Hoffer to take care of something. - And here he is. - Why do you need all these friars ? - To pray for you ? - Spaniards won't dare shoot at them. Order your brothers to take the ladders and raise them against the walls. Never. May the Lord have mercy on you. Carry the ladders or l'll boil you alive ! Please, my brothers, quickly. Hold your fire ! Those are our Dominicans ! Don't spout nonsense, captain. Open fire ! Order your men to fire ! Be brave ! Reinforcements are due any time. The Black Pirate ! Quickly, Spaniards, attack ! Forward ! Climb up ! Shoot them ! Where are those reinforcements ? Hold it ! This one is mine ! No, he belongs to the duke ! Retreat, it's all lost here. To the boats ! We must reach our galleon. Fight you ingrates ! Maracaibo is ours ! This man's will to survive is strong. ln a few days, he will be healthier that either of us. Waiting l recover to execute me ? Don't worry, if possible we will kill you sooner. We're waiting for duke Wan Gould. You're aboard his ship. May we go now doctor ? ln my opinion you have bad luck. Would be better for you to die sooner. Remember me ? - Aren't you the count of Lerma ? - Yes. And was a prisoner of pirates long enough never to forget to loathe them. Don't doubt l won't get even. You will spare me from agonizing death by hanging, l thank you. l did not forget l owe you for saving my life. You saved me, unfortunately. Unfortunately ? l have maybe a year to live, at best. Blood disease. lt is a sickness which afflicts aristocracy when it becomes old and tired. A sickness that is the sum of all my life's choices. New blood must replace the old. Who knows, perhaps even pirate's ? And you, count of Ventimiglia, called Black Pirate, what blood have you ? Pirate's, or count's ? Perhaps only the blood of a man, searching for truth, the difference between justice and injustice. Not that obvious ? Pablo ! Pedro ! Your escape won't be comfortable... Needn't go to undo trouble, l realize you cannot offer me an entire ship. Correct. Will a barrel suffice ? Next time we meet, l'll return the favor. No, this makes us even. l'm Spaniard, therefore your enemy. lf we do meet, it will be in battle. l hope you win. Rather lose my blood quickly in battle, than drop by drop. May l say l have profound respect for you sir. And l for you. We escaped in time. Maracaibo just fell. We are glad to see you. l am pleased to inform you we have a prisoner you deem highly valuable. Then it is true. Where is he ? Gallows. Tied up. Take me to him ! Want to see him right away. You two, leave the barrel, and come with me instead. ldiots ! You captured a man l hunted 1 0 years, all over the seas, an enemy of the Spanish throne, and what did you do ? You let him escape ! Find him ! Search everywhere ! He may still be on board ! These lazy Spaniards dozing at their posts ! Letting him escape right under their noses ! lf you cannot find him on board, lower the rafts and all after him ! - But that's my entire crew ? - What means more to you ? Don't you understand the Black Pirate is worth 1 00 galleons ? We will see if Black Pirate will be as dangerous once hanged. Lower all rafts ! Can you see him ? No ! Head for shore ! - See him now ? - No, not yet. We must catch him before he makes it to land. We were following the duke, and by chance found you. Raft from "Lightning" will wait for us in the lagoon, quickly. - There he is ! See him ? - He made it to shore ! - There they are ! - Shoot ! Won't you rather tell us where the gold is ? l don't know where it is ! l don't know anything. The Flamingos hid it, ask Wan Gould ! - What are they shouting ? - Morgan ! - What is that ? - Famous name. - No name is more famous than mine. - Look ! Who would have thought Morgan would seize emir's treasure with handful of dust ? l bet he will become the most famous pirate in all of Tortuga. Hope he remains on our side. Hate to have him for enemy. - Who might you be ? - l am Jean Davidnol L'Olonese ! Olonese ? Never heard the name ! - l'm joining him, bye Olonesi. - Me too. Bye. Should remind him to return to "Lightning". Commander will need us. - Hear anything ? - Nothing. Strange, l thought l heard something. No ! Don't move, be calm. Let him be. lf you're not his enemy, neither is he yours. - They were ours. - Did you find them ? Finding anyone in this jungle isn't easy. - Now what ? - Let's go the other way. Now that one, he was his enemy. See ? "Lightning" is waiting for us. My beautiful ship. lt's me, my count ! Wan Stiller ! My trustworthy Wan Stiller ! Yara ! Jose ! Raft is ready. That is why l was waiting here. You don't have a sword. Take mine. Dagger is sufficient for me. They discovered us, quickly ! Excellent, Carmauxi ! They were too far away for your knife, so you used a canon. lf only she could be here now. Still thinking of her ? lf my heart would beat, would do so for Honorata. What is that?! That is Wan Gould's galleon. What is Morgan doing ? Why doesn't he move ? They are still out of cannons' reach. Why doesn't she head for open sea ? - Perhaps he's afraid to lose you. - This way he will lose my ship ! Sail to open sea ! Away from shore ! Morgan must have gone mad. He's making human targets of them by sending them to the bow. - Captain, fire another round. - Fire ! Carmauxi ! My Lord, why aren't l dead instead. See, he moved. Fire ! Complete massacre ! Raise all sails ! Fire ! Rudder is blown to bits. My ship is lost. Their ship is crippled. Shall we go after her ? No, she is unimportant. Just blow her up. Count, look! Current is floating the bodies towards the galleon. We won't even be allowed to give them a proper funeral. Soon we will join their fate. Cannot go back, soldiers are waiting on shore. Rather go to my death fighting. Perhaps l might die aboard their ship. Forward ! Row ! Quickly ! - Fire ! - Fire ! More gun powder ! Fire ! They don't have firearms. - Use swords. - Stop ! l know your brave men could easily defeat the wretches, but likely by killing them. While l... would rather hang the Black Pirate alive. We're here, commander ! Friends, come ! The play with the corpses... - Was Morgan's idea ? - What a clever mind ! l told you count of Ventimiglia we shall meet again in battle. Please don't force me to kill you. Hope you will, is my last chance to die in battle. - l owe you for my life. - We are even. Don't belittle me, fight ! Yara ! We'll go together ! You and l ! No ! lnto the sea ! Commander. Yara knows the question... which denies your heart peace... Yara understands many things now so close to death. You too saw what l saw ? Why did they restrain my hand ? They only did... what your heart desired, the moment love entered it, and hatred departed. l think we are close to the 7th parallel. That is the Gulf Stream. Hereabouts we abandoned Honorata to fate. Currents will carry us to similar deaths. How ironic and diligent is fate. Let it carry you. And you will see, what Yara now sees. What Yara sees. What Yara sees. What Yara sees. What Yara sees. What Yara sees. Commander come see who made it back ! l see you are alive and well, as ought be. Seems we share similar fortune. Maybe the devil fears us, so he doesn't want us. Just as he didn't want you, doesn't want our "Lightning". - Commander ? Commander ! - My count ! - lsn't here. - My count ! These are fresh footsteps, leading to the sea... Couldn't have gone far. Though can't see them. Why did they leave ? l think because they saw the "Lightning". That would be a reason to wait for us. Or perhaps on the contrary. His ship "Lightning" represents a way of life to him which now is ended, even though is still ours, my friends. The small raft is carrying them towards a different life, a new life. THE END
