[happy music playing] [dramatic music playing] [narrator] Terror rules in Europe! The people are chained. Yet their souls do not submit. This film is made in the faith that those who batter down the prison gates from without will find brave allies among the prisoners within. -[plane engines buzzing] -[dramatic music playing] [loud explosion] [music continues] It's really here! The crisis! German troops have crossed the Polish frontier at five points. Hitler rejects all protests! [man] ...what's the news? The balloon is going up all right. -Hello, Frank. Got here? -Caught the last plane. ...but the boss wants to see you right away! -Right away. -Nice to see you, Frank. [everybody talking] The old man is waiting, Frank. He thought you mightn't make it. -Hello, Locky. -Hello, Colin. -How are you? -Fine. Well, come on, Frank. He can tell you -his troubles later. -Why? -What's the matter? -Oh, nothing. Just a general wind up! Is here! In person! Humor them. Locky, old boy. Humor them at the miserable victims of the war of nerves. Frank, you got that story? Quick! I haven't got a minute spare. -I'll see you in the pub. -All right. [man] Boy! [man] Boy! What's the matter, Colin? You look a bit dazed. -You got the bullet? -No. He's just informing that I've decided to resign. That's all. If anybody wants me, I'm in the pub. That's the first paid personal story of the war, Frank. Print every word of it, Evans. Page one! Send a copy right away to His Lordship. This government of ours haven't realized what kind of a world we're living in. Maybe this is the last beautiful day. Now, then. Let's fix who'll cover the battle fronts. Who's going to the express? -Knox, I suppose. -The mail? Probably, Harry Smith. -And the time? -Moe. Some literary child. Everyone marked is a star reporter. Now, you sort the men, Evans. We'll need to send all the good fellow to Paris right away. Then, we must hold a couple for the western front. Then, those remaining others, Sweden, and what about Norway? Jack! -You want me? -You got any good crime men. What about men for the battle fronts? Oh, sorry. I'm afraid they're already assigned. I'll tell you what. Why not try the sports staff? Won't be much for them to do now. You might get ahold of a pass with the sports editor. He used to be a good man once. Used to be 20 years ago. You want someone that can get around a bit in this war. Speed, boss! Speed! That's what you want. Some... lively young fellow, my lad. Try Metcalfe. -What? -Why not? He's used to finding out things -and mixing with people. -Metcalfe's never mixed with anything but horses. Send him to Norway, an he'll start steeple chasing with sea lions. Metcalfe's a typical product of a good-for-nothing minor aristocracy run to see. All the more reason to give him a chance to strike new rules. I've known this young fellow for some time and underneath this cheap shine there's good stuff. Well, I'm sorry, Frank. But he's already been tipped off to look for a job elsewhere. Wait a minute. I think Frank's right. I'll give Metcalfe his chance. Hello, Will. How did it all go? What a debate! You never saw such a dramatic scene. The house was seething. What about the labor party? Well, Arthur Greenwood stood up. Speak for labor, shout at the labor benches. [indistinct] shout at Amory: "Fuck the chair." I thought the roof was coming off. Greenwood said: "For 36 hours, the enemy's been attacking our ally Poland. What are we waiting for?" Well, what are we waiting for? I'm going back to the house to find out as soon as I have a drink. You will give him every chance. But this time he's gone as a bit too far. a drink. He had to be smacked with it as most. -Oh, where is that? -In the seat of the trouble. [woman 1] Oh, Mr. Metcalfe. -[woman 2] Same again! -Hmm. Why not, if tomorrow we die? I bet you are in favor of this war. I'm against anything that may result in the growing of potatoes in the Royal Enclosure -of Ascot Racecourse. -Listen to the... Come on, Metcalfe. Let's have a dirt on the wall stakes. Straight from the horses' mouth, gentlemen. [Colin] I'm in favor of scratching the event. Too late, my lad. They're all at the gate. The starter is ready with its flag. Hello. We just got back! -Hello. -Hello, Frank. Hello, Milligan. -Where'd you spring from? -Danzig. Get me a beer! Hello, Millie. I wrote every day. -Did you get my letters? -No, Mr. Lockwood. I'll tell your editor on you. Cut out the crosstalk, and give us the lowdown on Danzig. Buy a Sunday paper. Read a powerful article entitled "I was actually there", by Frank Lockwood. -Thank you, Miss. -[woman] You! -Double, Millie. -Double? Is that the Frank Lockwood? Of course! [Frank talking indistinctively] -Cheers. -Good luck. How are things making out? All right. But this rumor of a war seems to upset things. Still, I just have found myself another job. There's more scope for my undoubted talent. Listen, Colin. I've got a bit of news for you. The old man wants you to go to Norway. That was your idea, I suppose. You seem to get me all my jobs! Well, why will I go to Norway for? Fishing correspondent? Foreign correspondent! Important job. Why? Is Norway coming in? No. But apart from the actual theatres of war. It's the most interesting place in Europe. Anything might happen! Now, you go over there. Find out things, mix with people. Keep on the spot! But for the love of might. Don't go acting the giddy goat. You gotta give up all this racing business. Oh, my dear. Oh, boy. I'll pour my race glasses in the morning. Excuse me, sir. But I thought I heard you mention the name Danzig. -You did? -Well, is only a little place isn't it? Quite right, sir. Well, what I want to know is is Danzig worth fighting for? This is the man on the street. Frank, the average man. He's asking you a question, and the man on the street must answer. World War over Danzig? That's right. As you say, Danzig is only a small place. So was Thermopylae, and Verdun. And Madrid. All there's, small places. Big enough to bitter the people that hadn't the guts to fight for them. Did you ever hear Hitler laugh? I did. I was in Vienna. When he entered the city in triumph. "Providence has sent me here to save you." He bellowed to the model of his followers. "And I have only helped all those that had been against me." Then he laughed. It's a kind of mad laugh! And they all laughed too, in the same way. "You are bane for blood!" Hitler was giving it to them. We are in this for our own sweet selves. If we want to save our skins, we've got to fight. That's a good article in there, Frank. Ha! It'll cost you nine pounds a word to use it! I never pay more than seven pounds. Well, good night, sir. Look here. I gotta go. I better go to Norway. I would've climbed into a battle dress. Oh, no. You don't, my lad. Stick to your assignment! [exciting music playing] -Thank you, George. -Thank you, sir. Colin, darling, let's dance. No, I'd love to, but... I tell you'd be very good for your shoes. No. We get our coats, and then we walk a little, talk a little, maybe I'll hold your hand a little, and we'll forget, for a moment, that barbarity is been loosed upon the world. [soft music playing] Ah! Come on. I'll start by holding your hand. "Night's candles are burnt out. and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops." Oh! That is nice. -He's gone. -Oh, not anymore. [soft laughter] [puffs] I'm glad we got out of that sturdy place. I needed air. [accordion music] That looks rather amusing. Shall we have another drink? I thought you said you needed air. Yes. That'll do it. [laughing softly] Ha! Oh, bologny! You Norwegians ain't got no imagination! Shall I? Oh, listen buddy. Can't you take a joke? A joke? I've seen German submarines. Is that a joke? -Shh! -I will not "Shh." Party people, this seamen. It makes me choke. I'll get you a drink. [cheering in German] ...another ship yesterday in territorial waters. Aquavit. Two! -[man] English? -Yes! -How are you? -England are Norway friends. -Yes. -England win the war! You bet you will, once it starts. The Germans are swines! They sink our ships! [whispering in German] [singing "Rule Britannia"] [singing in German] [everybody singing] [speaks in foreign language] [glass breaking] [Germans singing] [singing stops] [complete silence] [everybody yelling] Who the hell are we neutral against, anyway? [indistinct yelling] Go on home. Get yourself a cab. I'll meet you some other time. No, you come with me! No, I'd love to, but I've got to fight. [noise continues] [indistinct yelling] [grunting] [man laughing] -That was good! -Thank you! -[both laughing] -Have a drink. -Yeah, aquavit. -Two aquavit. People say I know damn nothing, but I tell you I know damn all. I believe you. [sighing] Why don't you tell me something about it? I don't talk. I keep my mouth shut. Then I have no trouble. So, if you did talk, you'd have something to say about these Norwegian boats. And the lies of dozens of seamen. -Yeah. -Yes. All right. Come with me. I will show you. [indistinct conversations] Mister. Oh, thank you. [speaking in Norwegian] Do you often get parties like that? -Party? Oh! -[laughing] Party! Oh! [laughing] That a good one. Yeah! When I was young I used to enjoy that sort of party. Yeah! I didn't exactly hate that, but-- Yeah. It was not bad, but throwing bottles is dirty. It went near my head. Yeah. And it was meant to go near, my friend. This is my dinghy. Good, ah? -[laughing] Yeah. -Very good. He is the fastest dinghy in Langedal. -Really? -Yeah. When I am rowing it! [both laughing] -Well, here we are. [laughing] -[boat whistle sounds] Yeah. [wood cracking] How you like my nice, big ship, ah? [laughing] -It's terrific! -Yeah. Johnny! [speaks in Norwegian] [in English] We want to get out of here as quick as we can! [woman laughing] Who are you? What are you laughing at? Is not as funny as all that! From here it looks very funny indeed. [continues laughing] Mr. Metcalfe. [ship whistle sounds] Come in. [laughing] Comfortable, ah? -Very comfortable. -Yeah. -And big, ah? -Yes. Very big! Yeah. I am glad you like it. Kari! Now, we have a little drink, eh? Oh! Here is my head man. My daughter, Kari. How do you do? So glad to meet you. This gentleman is sailing with us. Oh. Hope you'd be very happy. Thank you. I'm sure I shall. You like this nice, big ship of ours? Yes. I think it's terrific. - Skal! -Skull! -Skull? -I beg your pardon? Skull! - Prost! - Prost! We thought you were not coming back, Fraulein. What happened? Yeah. All right. None of the English correspondents over here suspect-- Why should they? They still think this war -is going to be one long looking. -Yes. After we left here, we went down to the docks. A fight started in a bar. An argument over u-boats. He sent me away. But I didn't go very far. So, someone reported seeing -one of our u-boats. Ah? -Yes. Later, Metcalfe went to board the header of Langedal. and sailed. If he sailed for Langedal it may turn out to be a nuisance. ... in a wireless call to Langedal right away. Yeah. We've done a good night's work. It won't be forgotten. I do my duty as a German. That is all. [ship engine running] Well, I barely finished this rope. Is it all right? Yes, it's all right. But you take such a long time about it. Oh, my dear miss outsider. That's fair. Another old soul like you would've been practicing for two days. - -Is there? [laughing] [ship whistle sounding] [water splashing] Captain Alstad! Yury! Bring her over! [men singing in the distance] That is a German merchant ship. That's strange. An English song in a German ship? [men singing] I want to compete development. International law ruling, nuclear opinion. Get Metcalfe to interview every authority in Oslo. Foreign office, British Embassy-- That's just that he's not there. -What? -I've been phoning and phoning. He's not at his office. Not at the hotel. Not even in the bar. He's vanished. Disappeared. Call from Finland, Mr. Lockwood. Hello, Frank! Where are you? I've just made it throughout the frontier. I'm coming back on the first plane I'm getting out for the story. -What? Who? -[explosion] Who? Metcalfe? Why? What's he done? Oh, all right. I'll look in and see him in Oslo. -OK? -[explosion] Well, if he's far, he's far. Don't go on about it. [speaking in German] You know? One of these days you'll make someone a very good husband. -But not yet. -Oh, really? How long do you think it will take? Oh, you got a lot to learn! You know you look very funny when you peel potatoes? Everybody looks funny when they peel potatoes. In fact, you look funny to me. Do I? Why? [laughing] I don't know. You just do. Oh. Shaw, says the English laugh at anything they cannot understand. Did you read of our great George Vernon? Oh, yes. I like him very much. I think he's a very good writer. Almost as good as our Epson. -Do you read Epson? -Yes. Very good. I read a lot of English authors. Shakespeare, Dickens. -I write quite a lot, you know? -Oh, really? Oh, you must really peel a potato thinner than that. [dramatic music playing] [speaking German] What the devil are they firing at us for? I think they go on Norwegians. [indistinct dialogue] Down! Bring her over! [speaks in Norwegian] [seagulls squawking] [speaking Norwegian] [Kari] Well, here we are. Oh, you're going to like Langedal. Well, this is our village. How do you like it? I think it's charming. But is it early closing, or they all gone to the races. [laughing] Races? No! No. The street is full of people as a rule. Look, that's our... just on the left corner over there. Oh, that is old Peterson. He will tell us where everybody is. Oh, yeah. Old Peterson knows everything around here. [both] Hey, Peterson! -Yeah? -[Alstad] Peterson. Tell me. Where is everybody? They've all gone to the people's house. Wedding or something. I don't know. Oh, of course! Gerda is getting married! Oh, that is so lovely! They'll all be at the people's house! Come on, let's go! I must get dressed! No, I have no time for weddings. I must tell everything I have seen to the Police Inspector. Oh, he'll be at the wedding too! He goes anywhere where there's food and drink. And pretty girls. Ah, Kari? -[laughing] -Oh, well. I'll meet you there. And do hurry because we'll miss the dancing! She's excited, you know? [laughing] She is fond of dancing. [orchestra playing] Oh, there. Some of our good friends. Grocer Hendriksen. Postmaster Fossen. and here is our good Pastor, Pastor Lunder. Schoolmaster Olaf. And spokesman Bergen. He's always pleased to say it for himself. And now, friends. We must get all to the Police Inspector -at once! -[everybody talking] -Where is he? -He's dancing with Gerda. I must speak with him. [indistinct] As the Spokesman of Langedal, I will support your protest. It is an outrage for a foreign submarine to violate our waters! -Yeah. -We agree with our Spokesman. [everybody talking] All right. Here he is. [people talking and laughing] Ah! Little Gerda, much happiness! Alstad, my dear friend. I'm delighted to see you. Hello, Gunter. This is my good friend, -Mr. Metcalfe. -I'm always pleased to meet an English man. You're just in time to help me drink the alcohol of the happy pair. Now, come along! Drinks for my friends! Police Inspector, there is a matter of great urgency which concerns us all. I refuse to be serious on a day like this. Business later, my dear sir. Strike up the band! Yeah. But my friend and I have just come in from sea together. We were fired on by a German submarine. -Inside territorial waters. -Yeah. Now, you mustn't pull my leg anymore about u-boats, Alstad. Do you remember the last one? The one that turned out to be a dead whale. This was no whale, Police Inspector. Unless your local whales carry 4 inch guns. Shouldn't Oslo be notified at once, Police Inspector? Well, yes, and no. You see, my dear Schoolmaster, it's very hard to convince the authorities that such things happen. But, I'll make a note, of course. [orchestra playing] -Gerda! -Kari! Gerda, you look wonderful. It's because I'm so happy. Hello, kari. Owen, mind you keep her happy or I'll steer that ship of mine through those new nets of yours. -[laughing] -I'll try hard! Oh, isn't this exciting, HerrGunter? And to think that I almost missed the wedding. I'll make it my business to see that is one wedding you don't miss. You see, Kari. I can speak English as well as Mr. Metcalfe. But what I would like to tell you I would rather say it in Norwegian. -Yes? -[laughing] Oh, Kari. How nice you look. Oh, thank you. I'm so sorry to have run away, Mr. Metcalfe. But now you understand the reason, eh? Well, of course. I spent my life putting pleasure -before business. -Then in that case you won't be impatient. These things have to be done in a certain way, or we get no results. What you call "red tape", you know? Well, I'm going to Oslo today. Oh, but Mr. Metcalfe, you mustn't go. You'll be far more useful here helping me verify the facts. We'll be proud to have you as a guest. Yeah. My house is yours -as long as you like. -Oh, yeah. Thank you. But I think I will go back. That is our loss. But I hope we meet again, Mr. Metcalfe. Oh, but, please. You cannot go until you have danced. It's unlucky not to dance in a wedding. Yeah, she's right! Specially when your partner is the most beautiful girl in Langedal. Well, I'm so sorry. I must go now. But, we officials are not just ordinary citizens We have our duties, you know. Kari. Good bye. Ah, Hendriksen. [both speaking Norwegian] One, two, three, four, five, six, and-- Oh, it's difficult! Only because you're so clumsy. Almost as clumsy as you are in a ship. How about the Police Inspector? Oh! He dances beautifully. But he is a little awkward, you know? -Awkward why? -Oh, because he wants to marry me. But yet, he seems to me just much too important. -He's very handsome? -Mmh-hmm. [orchestra playing] [in German] That's wonderful! [in English] We should sell those bridges. See who that is. [blowing horn] [tires screeching] [machine sounds] It's Police Inspector Gunter, comrades. Take these into the other room. Good evening, Herrvicecounselor. Hi, Police Inspector. Just the man I wanted to see. -Cigar? -No, thank you. - Herrvicecounselor. -I've some good news for you. Our squadrons are heading for the sky. And behind them, a troop transports some destroyers. So, the hour is approaching. They are coming to protect Norway from these British war mongers. They're coming as friends, not enemies. I've German blood in me. I understand. And I'll make these people understand it too. Good. I'm relying on you. And your popularity will help us, when the time comes. By the way, this English man. I've just spoken to him. I tried to head him off but he insists on going back to Oslo, to make a report. That's serious. -When is he leaving? -This evening. Ulrich, I want you to take the next train to Oslo. [seagulls squawking] Thank you. What is that blot on the landscape? It is the new oil refinery they are building. Yeah. There are lots of German engineers working there. They bring their machinery -and men. -They work day and night. They say it is to help us. When we kill whales and bring back the oil. And, Mr. Metcalfe, is time to go. You've only half of an hour to catch the train for Oslo. Goodbye. Thanks for the trip, it was exciting, wasn't it? -Yeah. -Yeah, it was exciting. You must come and see us again, soon. -Yeah. -Goodbye. Mr. Metclafe! You haven't said "Goodbye" to me. It's been very good knowing you. I do hope you come and visit us again soon. I hope so. Goodbye! Goodbye. [speaking Norwegian] [bells tinkling] [car engine revving] [people talking] Nice to see you back, sir. -Any letters for me? -Yes, sir. Yeah, but, after all, What does this Altmark incident matter? Is interesting, but not important. But it proves, conclusively, that the British violate neutrality! Altmak was a German naval prisonship, operating in neutral waters disguised as a merchant one. It's one more proof! There's no place for neutrals in World War Germany. [speaking German] Who are all these men? Tourists. Just tourists. -Just tourists, ah? -There's a gentleman waiting to see you in the lounge, sir. -What was his name? -A Mr. Lockwood. Lockwood? Locky! Ah, the great scooper. How come the left you off the old mark? -Locky-- -I'm glad to see you. I'm glad to see you. What you've been having? Have a drink! Give them all a drink, will you? I've got a story here that's going to make you all look like platers in the derby. Well, Locky, old boy, how are you? I've read your little pieces from time to time. Not bad. Not bad at all. Look here. They're waiting for me. The British Legation asked. I can't go into details. I'll tell you all about it as soon as I get back. Oh, no. you won't. -Why? -I've been waiting to see you for over two hours. I've got exactly ten minutes to catch my plane to London. Oh, what a damn shame. Nevermind. You'll read all about it in our paper tomorrow morning. -Lead story. -Oh, no. I won't. Why? Locky, you'll stay with the paper, aren't you? I am, old boy. But you are not. You are fired. Hey, sonny! -Get my hat and coat quick. -Yes, sir. Fired? What for? What you people don't seem to realize is that the foreign correspondence job is not just to cover spot news that any ordinary agency can do. But to finding out something of vital importance, that may alter the cause of the whole war. Yes. You may think that, old boy, but the paper doesn't. They're pretty fed up with you. You've been playing the fool here, old boy. You sent them that cock-and-bull story about machine-guns and mobs. You missed the outmark story. You let the paper down. You let me down. Why the devil didn't you stick to your assignment? Because I prefer to use my own methods. That assignment sorts out very well. But if you want real hot news you've got to follow your hunches. You're getting psychic now, ah? I tell you I've got a story here that the whole world is waiting for. Are they? Well, I'm not I'm sorry, old boy, but I've got to get off. Goodbye, good luck. See you some time. Ah, tip this boy for me. Will you? And the third shot got us smacked! And everything came down. Luckily there were no casualties. There were no casualties, sir. Peppered, ah? -Yes, peppered. -Rummy! Devilish rummy. The whole thing. It's not rummy at all, is perfectly clear. I suppose you are sure of the name -of this perishing fjord . -Of course I'm sure! Because I always get it mixed up, myself. Hand me over that book, will you? Heavy, isn't it? Pretty decent country up there, ah? Good snipe shooting too. I'd rather fancy myself with that set of lighters. You have to give them six seconds before you pull. My old dad put me up to that wrinkle. As soon as he saw one get up he'd say, "There goes a blinking snipe." Bang! Send that message to the Admiralty at once. I would like to speak to HerrMetclafe, please. On what name, please, Madame? Kari Alstad. If you'll take a seat. I'll make inquiries. [soft music playing] [several conversations] Damn you, Evans, for a bigodet knit with a lump of nauseating suet! Romania nothing! It's Norway next! Look here, Colin, I had you fired, but it might be reconsidered. Listen, they had a party here at the German embassy last night. Every high official in Norway was asked. They showed a film. Called, "Baptism of fire." The Polish campaign in pictures. Somebody was there? Tell me all about it. Clear the format, Jack! Hold everything! There's a hell of a story breaking. Listen, that film they showed was horrifying. It's the old Nazi game. Terrifying a victim first, and then hitting them hard. Operator! You've cut me off! Hey, a girl like you shouldn't sit alone! I prefer to, thank you. Oh, come now. Why should you want to sit alone? I do not wish to be rude. I just wait for Mr. Metcalfe. Now, what does that two-timing racing tipster got that we haven't got? Search me. [soft music continues] [Kari] Oh, Mr. Metcalfe! -Mr. Metcalfe. -Kari! What on Earth are you doing here? I've come to see you. Well, I'm sorry. I got a dash. It's important. Oh, but I've got something to tell you! Something important too! I'm sorry. Look here, couldn't I see you afterwards? Oh, will you not see me now, please? All right, what is it? Well, not here! I don't like your friends very much. -Nonsense, they're nice people. -No. I know just the place. Somewhere nice and quiet. Do you like my hat? Well, it looks a nice, warm hat. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean-- Oh! Please do not talk until I have finished. I have so little time. Five minutes and I must go back to bagging because my father is waiting for me. Should we sit down? Yesterday, two German ships came into Bergen. They're very big ships. This morning, three more have come. Also very big ships. -Warships? -No. Merchant ships. It is obvious that they've come to dock. They are deep down in the water so their halls must be full and yet they unload no cargo. Go on! Well, this morning, my father'd go to investigate but they have put in guard around these ships and no one may go near them. What's your father think the cargo is? -Men. -Men? German soldiers. Well, that means any moment now. Probably at dawn tomorrow. Well, I must go now. Kari, you've been wonderful. Oh, no. I have done nothing at all. My father's done everything. Oh, yes, you have. I shall never forget it. I don't forget you either. [soft music playing] -That for me? -Mmh-hmm. You must wear that when you come to see with us again. You'd really laugh at me if I do. -Won't you? -Perhaps. [music continues] Go on, now! I must go now. Goodbye. Can I come to see you off? No. You have so much to do. Besides, I'd rather say goodbye to you here. It's so much better than a railroad station, isn't it? Goodbye, then. Goodbye. [music continues] Oh, here's a taxi for you. [tires screeching] British Legation. [engine revving] [speaks in German] [dramatic music playing] [intriguing music playing] Hello! Hello! Open this door! Hello! Where am I? What is this ship? I gotta get off this ship! Do you understand? I gotta get off! What is that noises? -Are you the captain? -Yeah. Well, look here, I gotta get back to Oslo. [laughing] Oslo? Too far, my friend. Bremen is much nearer. So, I've been Shanghaied! My God! But you was drunk. I've never seen a man so drunk! Your too friends, they must carry you on board. What wonderful drinking it must have been! -Oh! -[dramatic music playing] [music intensifies] [noisy talking] Just said, "If we send ships into Norway, we're gonna thrash the Germans out! Stop the house shed medley." Come along, miss-- And Lord George, he's white men shaking with the vehemence of his attack declared, "We've suffered a terrible defeat. We owe that to this government. But the nation has got to repair it. It's no good hiding the disaster. Let us face it like men of British blood." But the most dramatic moment came when Amory pointed to the Prime Minister and said, "I invoke Oliver Cromwell. You've sat here too long for any good you do. Depart, I say. In the name of God, go!" [machine sounds] [dramatic music playing] [man on radio] " I have nothing to offer anyone but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. We have before us", Mr. Churchill continued, " an ordeal of the most grievous kind." " We have before--" [music playing on the radio] [captain] We are damned! We must hear dear Mr. Churchill. "...victory, at all costs." [indistinct dialogue] "Victory, however long and hard the road may be. For, without victory, there is no survival. Let that be realized. No survival for the British Empire." That is good! Bad news, ah? Bad news? No. Great news! Mr. Churchill promised you blood, toil, sweat, and tears, and you call that great news? Hmm. But you wouldn't understand. No, yeah. I'd understand. Dr. Goebels has explained everything on the wireless. You are finished! Kaput! -Kaput my... -What? I told you you wouldn't understand. [alarm beeping] [fast steps approaching] [speaking German] [bullet approaching] [loud explosion] Signal just for Thank you. I'm afraid you're having a roundabout trip, Mr. Metclafe. We've been ordered to proceed to shore our boat to help evacuate the wounded. What does that mean? Look as other friends are cracking up. Tell Cotton to standby to receive wounded! [turbine running] [loud explosion] [machinegun firing] How are things below? I kept proving the sickbay for two or three of the worst cases. The rest of them were kept on the deck. Well, I hope these were the whole-- We're in a devil of a mess of it. [machinegun firing] [turbine running] Don't bother about it, lads! He's one of ours! [man] Take cover! -[rotor sound intensifies] -[machinegun firing] Stratton is always right, boys. -[man laughing] -Moving! [indistinct dialogue] Hold, men. I'll give you a hand. Come on, my old champ. Come on. we ain't got much time! Great victory. Do you see? About ten feet high without a word of a lie. It comes right up to me, kicks me right in the mouth [indistinct] I'll look after him for you. [indistinct dialogue] [explosions in the distance] [indistinct dialogue] Locky! -Look here, what's happened? -Nothing, my lad. Caught a bit of a swag. You're on this job. That's great! Scoop me for one. [indistinct] I can't see a thing down here. -Locky. -[explosion in the distance] How bad is it? Can I do anything? No. I don't think I'm going much further with this caravan. I've got a great story. Call this, "The French never blew up bridges they never had a chance." Fony orders given all along, the land. Now, I cannot remember. Ask about the bridges. Mass bridges too. I took the story to the ... offices. -[speaks weakly] -[explosions] I... [speaking weakly] ...too. [alarm buzzing] [airplanes flying over] [loud explosions] Oh, Metcalfe... is covering the ... handicaps. So, put him where he's doing anything he ought to know, will you? I can't match a handicapped. [loud explosion] What about that handicapped? Admiral's statements! Just come in! -What? -"Monthly shipping losses. The Admiralty announced that the shipping losses, British and allied, for the month just ended have reached a total of 689, 229 tons!" 689 thousand tons? Do you realize what that means? Jack! There's landing battles, you lead story. Nothing else matters! Do you hear? Is that how it works. Metcalfe, I want you. 689 thousand tons. That's terrifying. In a single month, too, the highest yet! Now, in the last war when Lloyd--. Enough. It means ships, and food. And guns, and tanks, and planes. Vital necessities. All chucked away. Rotting and roasting down among the minnows. Say nothing about lives of thousands of merchant seamen. Doing their job in one moment, and the next moment they're floundering about in the water. While those grinning devils stick around watching the bubbles come up. Oh, I tell you. Sitting here doing sweet Fanny Adams, writing about it is driving me raving mad. You aren't the only one. I'm older than you. But that doesn't mean my hands aren't itching to get ahold of them. Well, why don't we? Always the press are reserved occupation. Is because the press has its job like any other service. And that job is to deliver the news. not make it. They say it's everyone's war, ah? But if the public don't know anything about it, the public can't do anything about it. And that's what newspapers are for. To tell them. And contrary to the usual idea, newspapers are thus run by newspaper men. -Hmm. -You stick to your job, son. Remember Lockwood. Always stuck to his assignment. No matter what happened. Yes. I'm not likely to forget him. But Locky was in the thick of it. He wasn't scooping around in a tin hat looking in the bomb craters. And when we hear about these shipping losses, all this stripe about civilians being in the front line, really doesn't wash. And do we've got a front of our own we've gotta drive home the meaning of this Atlantic battle. Make people realize if it isn't one we're done for. We're losing ships faster than we can build them. Well, we've gotta build ships faster! Unload ships faster. Yes. And then, we'll learn to eat less. And wear less. And generally, learn to go without. It's you job to tell the public that. You can do it alright. ... is very pleased with these Norwegian articles. Listen, didn't I always say there was the making of a journalist in him? No, you didn't. All right, I'll do it. I will start this story in the ports. Right under the bombs. And we'll take it right through Britain. Every street and every house. And by the time we've finished with it, we'll have the whole country on its feet. The Battle of the Atlantic to be won in the docks, in the works, and in the kitchen stove. Winston said the other day we'd beat these... senseless, we have to live on porridge. Right? We'll beat Hitler with a saucepan. That's it! A right rip-roaring campaign. You know, we'll beat these blasted u-boats yet. Are you sure I didn't say it was the making of a journalist in him? Of course you didn't. Funny. I meant to. [man] Come in. Coastal command reconnaissance photographs just come in, sir. Oh, good. Let's have a look. -Have they found anything? -Nothing that suggests a submarine there, sir. But the fact remains that submarines are operating from Norwegian bases and we've got to locate them. Well, I'll have to search every inch of the coast line. they weren't plastered doing it. Never saw anything. Probably had a camouflage. Yes, sir. Ask Commander Pittwaters to come up here, please. I can't see any of these photographs, sir. That's the idea to camouflage, my dear fellow. Somewhere in this fjord here, you know, there's a u-boat base, and we've got to find it. -Did you ask for me, sir? -Oh, yes, Pittwaters. I think you can help me. Just a minute. Do you know this northern district? No I haven't been there, sir. I don't know well. But I think I know a Johnny who does. -Hello, Colin. -Hello. -What's your poison? -Ale, please. Hello, George. News bad tonight, Colin? -Not so I've heard -What've you heard? Not very much, except this shipping situation's not so good. And this time we can't just seat back and not worry. -I say, leave it to the Navy. -Sorry, chum. The old Bill! -Howdy! -[indistinct] Tell me the world is small. The last time I saw you it was on the beach. That's right. The old Pebbley... -What are you having? -Thanks ... -Two punch... - Seems a long time since Dunkirk. Yeah. What day did you get away? I ran away on Tuesday. Tuesday! You're lucky. Oh, Wednesday was horrible! Was it? Yes, rained all the damn day. [whistle intensifying] [loud explosion] [explosions] All right, gentlemen. You can resume the vertical. What we technically call "they near missed." Large whiskey, please. [indistinct conversations] Glad to see you, Metcalfe. Quite a coincidence. -You remember me? Oslo. -Yes, of course. We had a little chat in the Legation, you were grumbling about being shot at -or something. -[laughing] Yes. -How are you? -As a matter of fact I'm a bit shaken. That damn thing was a bit too near for comfort. -Have a drink. -No. I got one, thanks. -Still scribbling? -I'm afraid so. Oh. Let's sit down. -How are you? -Pretty beat. You look remarkably fit. Yes, I think you're a bit of an athlete in your time, ah? Cross country running? A little bit. -Rower? -No, not usually. Hmm. You swim, of course. [whistle intensifying] -[loud explosion] - No. What's all this about? Nevermind, you'll soon pick it up. Good luck. -Good luck? -I really mean that, my dear fellow. The very best luck. By the way... what was the name of that perishing fjord you had out spotted bothering? -What? Langefjord? -That's the spot! A pal of mine would like to have a chat with you about that. What, is it? A story? I shouldn't be surprised. Mind if we pub along to see him now? -No. not if it's a story. -Good! Ah... Are you married or anything? -No. -No near relations? No! Good. I'm glad about that. Anyway, they're an awful ball. By the way, I suppose you heard they've dug up the golf course in St. Andrews and they're planting potatoes on the fairways... [engine revving] [blowing horn] [loud explosions] [tires screeching] [doors opening] Noisy brutes! This place could do with a clean up, don't it? Yes, I agree. Their Lordships don't think so. "Scruffy offices, clean ship." That's their motto. This is the bloke you're going to see. Nice chum. Come in. -[Door closing] -Captain Weverly, this is Mr. Metcalfe. I'm very glad to see you, Metcalfe. How do you do, sir? I read those Norwegian articles of yours. Very good. Oh, thank you, sir. It wides up the event. But still, very good. He looks remarkably fit. Doesn't he, sir? Yes, he does. And no near relatives, you know? -Nice capital. -I wish you'd tell me what all this is about. -You're a journalist. -Yes. Then you know of the u-boat situation -in the Atlantic? -I'm working on it now. Perhaps we can help each other. [thud] Now, this u-boat campaign is taking quite a new turn. They're no longer operating in ones and twos from recognized basis, we can handle that. Now, they're turning out in packs of a dozen. From some base, which I suspect to be run about here. -Oh, that's the Langefjord. -Yes. That's why we sent for you. Just wait a minute. Here we are. You know this district. You've friends there. I want that base located and destroyed. My suggestion is... [vehicle approaching] Now, the location of your target and the importance of your mission is been explained to you by the Intelligence. I think it would be a good idea to go on with your crew, and tell them about the job in hand without giving too much detail. -Yes, sir. -And remember, that after you've dropped your passenger you and your crew must forget about him. Very good, sir. -Good luck. -[all] Thank you, sir. Now, listen, boys, you know where we're going, but I've got a surprise for you. And that is, we're not going to drop bombs but a bit of fleet street. Here he comes, now. Hi, Mr. Metcalfe. May I introduce you to the crew, sir. Yes. I wish you wouldn't call me "sir". I would have called you sir. And any other captain of the aircraft. Do you hear that, boys? That's proper respect for you. -Let it be a lesson to you. -Yes, sir. Anything you say, sir. Jolly good show, sir. I have a very disrespectful crew. So I see. Mr. Metcalfe is a very distinguished journalist and what's more, he's going on a one-way trip. Ok, sir. We'll look after him alright. Are you the bloke that tipped Taj Mahal at the derby? -Hmm. -Glad to meet you, sir. I backed it half a crown each way! I hope you remember to make him sign of bloodshed, sir. [soft laughter] [Colin] How does this thing work? I'll do that for you later. [Colin] Is this what I pull? You can if you'd like, sir. But it wouldn't be of much use. That's what you pull. -Evening, Metcalfe. -Evening, sir. Your all fixed up. That's good. I brought your instructions. Flimsy. I expected something more substantial -than that. -The less substantial the better. That's rice paper, that is. -You may have to eat it. -Eat it? Yes. Paper's all right. The ink shocking. The point is that if you were caught that mustn't be found on you. That's fine! You take over, I'll look after our passenger. -Contact port! -Contact port! Once you've located the u-boat base and you guided our bombers in, next, -Night assaulter. -That's what I said! -Right! -You get in touch with that man that I spoke to you of and he'll see you cross the Swedish frontier. -All right, sir. -Then you will leave -the rest to us. -[Colin] Oh, by the way when I get back, and I print it... [indistinct] Mind your fellow every time. -When you get back? -Goodbye and good luck. Come along here, now. I'll show you where you'll make yourself comfortable. Thank you. [indistinct] [Colin] No! -You know this...sir? -No! Then you don't know the little golf court of ... with the trees running right aside of the mine on the canal running across are pretty. [Colin] Yes! So do I! [man 1] Put the light out, there! [man 2] Put that thing out. [turbine running] You can go to sleep here if you want to! [indistinct] -What? -I'm not in the mood! Well, it wouldn't matter if you did. I'd wake you up in the right time. We never fail in our purpose. Except to cross when the navigator takes the wrong turn! Shame, sir. I never get lost! Where are we? About here! That's what he says but with his navigation we're probably over Wagner ridges. Don't you believe it, sir. That's where we are, Ulrich. We're about 12,000 now! Feeling cold? Shivering a bit. I don't think it is from the cold. If I were you, I'd be unconscious! Is time you were putting that thing on. We're there! [turbine running] OK! Open her up! [wind whistling] [man] Don't forget, count three and then pull! Happy landing! When you get back, come and look us up in the base! OK. If I don't get in the one down there. [wind blowing] Off you go! [dramatic music playing] [speaking German] [speaking German] [music continues] [loud shooting] [music continues] [shooting continues] [speaking German] [music slowing down] [speaking German] Go down the road, half a kilometer. There you will find a bakery. -Aren't you a German? -German? [spits] Austrian. Half a kilometer. And the password is, "I hear you make very good rules." Good luck. You better take that off. [water splashing] [knocking on door] [knocking on door] Who's that? [Colin] I hear you make very good rules. Come in. I'm glad you're safe! I was informed of your arrival. My house is yours for as long as you wish. It's very good of you, but I don't think I can stay. I gotta go to Langedal. -How far is it? -Langedal? Oh, that's the other side of the fjord . But I've a friend who'll take you over there. But you must have some food! Come on! Ingrid. Please. How'd you do? This is our friend from England. Oh, but you must be cold. -Come and sit down. -Thank you. He's come to help us. Yes. You must be hungry. -Please. -No. I'm not hungry. But I'd love some coffee, please. Yes. You know old Alstad over at Langedal? He's in the internment camp. Why? What's he done? Said what he thought. What we all think. Thank you. And his daughter, kari. How's she? He do not speak of her. -Why not? -She's brought disgrace on us all. By promising to marry a so called Norwegian. Police Inspector, Gunter. After the invasion, he became rich and powerful. Kari saw a chance and she took it. Kari? -It's incredible! -So are many things. It's incredible that I have to bake bread for Germans! Mr. Metcalfe. The bridegroom. How's your wife? She's fine. She's going to have a baby. -Congratulations. -[soft laughter] I'm sure it'll be a wonderful baby. I think it will. Our good friend, Olaf, will take you to Langedal. -All right? -All right. Oh, Olaf. I hear our friend's there. It must be time. It is cold. You must have a coat. -Thank you. -[door closing] [indistinct dialogue] Thank you. I can't thank you enough for all you've done. You're risking your lives, you know? Oh, please, my friend. I'm happy this chance has come to help my country. I'm sure you are. -Thank you for the coat. -Bye. [man on radio] London calling the European service of the BBC. The news in Norwegian follows immediately. -[man on radio in Norwegian] -We must go. [news continue] [news in Norwegian] [wood cracking] -Who are they? -New boat men. Fresh crews, coming every day. [ocean waves in the distance] [man speaking German] [in English] Your papers, please. Ah? Oh, papers, yeah. -Where's he gone? -Who? -The man you was with. -Oh, him. You know him. He's always with me. He lives down the street. -with his-- -Oh! [blowing whistle] [orchestra playing] [man] Oh, this is it. German-Norwegian friendship, mate. "Dance and refreshments. Attendance compulsory." [orchestra continues] [speaks in German] [in English] You refuse to dance with me because I'm a German? No. Because I'm a Norwegian. [speaks in German] [orchestra continues] [mouthing] I have good news for you, Kari. It won't be long, now. [man yelling in German] [yells in German] [yelling in German] [in English] What is it? I'm sorry about this interruption. Go back to your seats, everyone. Have your papers ready for identification. [speaks in German] [man speaking German] [speaking German] [speaking German] [man continues speaking German] Silence! Don't stand there waiting. Get some order into this place. [noise continues] Friends! No we are partners in the Nordic Brotherhood. Let us all cooperate for our own good! [people laughing] Silence! Music! Play something! Silence! Arrest that man! [noise continues] [speaking German] [continues in German] [continues in German] -Fire! -[shooting] [people screaming] [Kari in English] Come with me, quickly. To meet your friend, the Police Inspector? Oh, won't you trust me? Holy God! You busted your only chance! I haven't much choice, have I? [several noises] [Kari] Now, hurry! Take the first turn here, on the left, the second doorway on the left. I will be with you in a moment only. -I must speak to someone. -Yes, I expect you must. Oh, don't talk that. Remember, first turn on the left, second doorway. Well, you said you had no choice! [sighing] -Kari, are you hurt? -No. How did you get outside? I got swiped out with a lot of other people in the dark. Are there many hurt in there? It is of no importance. I am only concerned about you. It is very unfortunate, but these things -have to be done. -You think so? Come along. I'll lead you to your house. But is only a few steps-- Don't you understand? My men will question you -if I'm not with you. -[man] Gunter! [speaks in German] You must go. You have your duty. [man] Gunter! Remember, if you're questioned answer quickly. -Be very careful. -I will. [closing door] It's all right. You'll be safe here. Will I? Colin... don't look at me like that! Don't you realize that it was only by promising to marry Gunter that I could get my father released? All right, go on! Think what the others think! No, don't. Don't. Colin, do you really believe that I could marry a half-German? No, I don't! Kari, when I got back and they told me you were gonna marry Gunter... first of all, I was angry... then I tried to think of you as a traitor. I tried to forget. Forget something that started that day at Oslo. But nothing did start that day in Oslo. Oh, yes it did! I didn't know then, but I knew soon afterwards. Oh, Kari! I think this is the best moment I've ever had. [breathing deeply] Me too. Gunter told me tonight that very soon he will release my father. When did they take him away? Oh, I don't know. Weeks, and weeks, and weeks ago! One night we heard on the English wireless Our king has answered the traitor Quisling who told him to abdicate. But he'd say he cannot give up his people. When he become king he sweared to keep us free. He will not abdicate. But the Germans do not want anyone to know what the king'd say. But my father... He wrote out hundreds, and thousands of times the king's speech on little pieces of paper. And gave them himself to the people. Then, one day. Gunter came and caught him writing. He took him away. My darling, all over Europe, good, kind people had been taken away. Yes, I know, but can you not think what it means to a seaman never to be free, never to hear the wind, or to sail in the fjords? -Does he know about Gunter? -No. No, and I hope he never will. Before he went away we used to talk very often of how he will try to reach England in a little boat. I came here hoping to see him. I wanted him to help me. Something very important. Do you remember what he said the first time we ever met on the header? Yes. -"This is my head man." -That's right. And now, you've gotta help me instead of him. [quick clicking] [man] I'm through to England. [clicking] Oh, come in, Olaf. -Hi. -Oh, it's cold out, tonight. There are lots of German in the cafe, drinking schnapps. To keep the cold out. A lot of schnapps, Mr. Metcalfe. -You learned anything? -Yeah, I learned a lot. They talk when they've been drinking schnapps. [clicking continues] Code message. Just come in, sir. -Norway excels it. -Thanks. Hello. Put me through to the director of Naval Intelligence. Hello, sir. Wallace Officer here, sir. I have a decoded message from Norway. X-Ray, London, Zebra. U-boat base located in Langefjord. Heavily camouflaged. Site is 14 miles south of the village Langedal. U-boats concentrating for Atlantic raid Wednesday, 20 to 30 onwards. Very good, sir. [ocean waves] [sobbing] Oh, father! Oh, it is good to see my little head man again. [sighing] We're a couple of fools to stand sniveling here. Come on any other room. I've got some coffee, and it is warm. Oh! -Alstad! -Olaf, my friend! Welcome back to Langedal. But it is a pretty poor place to come back to, now. Oh, you're wrong, my friend. It is the best place to come back to. I have seen awful things. This is the best place to try and forget. Mr. Hendriksen, Schoolmaster. -Postmaster. -Alstad. -Mr. Metcalfe! -I came back just in time. Yeah, but why have you come here? Listen, I tell you... I've been sent here to get into the u-boat base. It's gonna be bombed tonight. But our planes can't locate it by their rough bearings. So, I've gotta get in, and signal them with a flash lamp. Yeah, but you must not go without me! This is worthwhile coming home for. [man] It is work for a younger man, Alstad. [Colin] Yes. It's not gonna be a picnic. Yeah, but I have old scores to pay. It is my right. Listen, Mr. Metcalfe, I know every fjord , every creek, every path, every track. There is no man in Langedal must take you there but Alstad. We will take the header. When do we start? Well, I've had a code message to say that our bombers already left. They should reach there about 11:00. Oh! Then there is not much time. But how do we go in? The base is heavily guarded! -Well, he's fixed that. -Yeah. The passes with the official stamp. Clark invaders' office thought they might be useful. Yeah. Funny how the new order doesn't seem to catch on. [ocean waves] We better be going. Those guards are getting curious. They will be more curious before this night's work -is over. -[whispering in Norwegian] [both] Good luck. I wish I was coming with you. Oh, there will be plenty for you to do when the bombs come. We will do all that we can. -Yeah. -[Whispering in Norwegian] [sighing] -Here's the torch. -Thank you. You will need a scarf or something. It'll be so cold out. No, don't worry about us. We shall be all right. -Come back soon, won't you? -My Kari. I will see that the street is clear. [sad music playing] I'll look after him. What's the matter? I was just wondering how I could ever have laughed at you. [soft laughter] I hope you always laugh at me. Goodbye. [boat engine running] [sighing] Operation orders, gentlemen. The third flotilla were put to sea at 23:25 hours. Objective, enemy convoys, and shipping in the north Atlantic. Tactics, mass attack. The flotilla will strike as a unit. Thus inflicting the maximum damage. Cruising period, 10 to 14 days That is all. Now, gentlemen. My toast is for the greatness of the German fleet. [all] Prost! [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] Remember this is the biggest u-boat attack ever undertaken. And the High Sea Command wants results. Once we have destroyed the Atlantic bridge, the war is won. -Good luck. -Thank you. Why do these Naval fellows never drink our fuhrer's toast? Because, strange enough, their tradition is British. They are modeled on the British Navy. We're curing them of it, of course. They've already given up all antique notions chivalry, picking up survivors and so forth. But they don't drink our fuhrer's toast. Yet. [yelling in German] God, I'd like a cigarette. [Alstad] Yeah, me too. And a cup of coffee. [turbine running] Listen. [man] It's all right, men. They've been over many times, but they've never been able to find us. The cliffs make this place impossible to detect from the air, even in daylight. That's why we chose it. When we were disarmed and helpless. [turbines running] [indistinct dialogue] [yelling in foreign dialogue] [man] There she goes. OK. Insert your... [Colin] I'll target near the base. You stay here. Keep flashing. [Alstad] All right. [turbines buzzing] Good luck, my son. [click] [shooting] [alarm buzzing] [yelling in German] [bomb whistling] [yelling in German] -[bombs whistling] -Fire! [machine gun firing] [click] -[machine gun firing] -[bombs whistling] [door closing] Where's father? He's not coming back, Kari. [sighing] [sobbing] I'll take care of you. [sobbing] [phone ringing] Hello. Splendid! Operation successfully concluded. -Target destroyed. -Good. Good show on the old fellow's part, isn't it? [indistinct] -Metcalfe. -That's what I said. A big part. -Get my car, will you? -Last... [dramatic music playing] [indistinct conversations] [music intensifies] [man yelling in German] By the order of Governor ... you are under arrest. -Why? -Fall in! All right! [music continues] [woman screaming] All right! [music continues] [knocking on door] Come in. Gerda. What's the matter? They've taken my Olaf. They're going to shoot him. But why? Unless they find the English man. They're going to shoot all of them. The Spokesman, the Schoolmaster. [Gerda] All of them! Gunter ordered it. Oh, that murderer. I came to you. You know the English man. He's our guest, Gerda. If you knew where he was, would you give him up? No. But my poor Olaf. Please, help me, Kari. Please. [sobbing] I will. -I will! -[sobbing] Now, you must go home, Gerda. I'll think of something. I don't know what. But I'll think of something. [sobbing] [door closing] Colin! Colin! Colin! I've just come from the Police Station. Your Englishman has given himself up. You all betrayed me. You all betrayed your country. You'll be shot as a spy. I don't matter. But the others must be released! They're fine people. Oh, please. Please, you must help them. That is impossible, they are traitors. And besides, the matter is out of my hands. But I still have the power to save you. Kari, I need you. Soon I'll get leave, and we'll be married. Leave me alone! You're hurting me! I must go! Don't you understand I want to go? Take her away! So, you refuse to give me any information about the spy. We have nothing more to say. Do you know what a spy is, HerrSpokesman? Among other things, it is a man who helps his country's enemies. Not only are you traitors to your country. But you have a lot of German deaths on your consciences. And for me, a German, that is enough. You'll be shot at dawn, tomorrow. We shall die for our country. With a clear conscience. As true Norwegian should. An idea we are common at. [officer] You wish to speak. You came to Norway, to build an oil refinery. But instead, you built a secret u-boat base. Only yourself does speak perfect Norwegian. Why? Because they learnt it here. As refugee kids in the last war. They were hungry. And these people took pity on them, and helped them. And you took them back to Germany, and formed them into special battalions for the invasion of Norway. And now you ask them to shoot the people that were kind to them. It won't do any good, you know? To kill just a few. Because there are millions more like them. Fishermen, and bakers, and grocers, and Schoolmasters. Ordinary people. You can't kill them all. And the day will come. Maybe sooner than you expect, when they all rise up against you and be free again. And then, God help you. That's enough. Take them away. [steps approaching] Half an hour. [indistinct whispering] Morning already. Must be nearly time. Half an hour. Is good they let us be together. Without you I would be afraid. I thought about you so much since you go away. I thought about you too, Kari. I made a vow of mine that we'd meet again. I wish to God we hadn't. You mustn't say that. -It's my fault. -No. No, they'd catch me anyway. One day. And know how I hate them. It's worse for you than for me. You've so much to live for. Well, I know so well what you're thinking. You see, Kari... I found something here in Norway. I'd give anything to tell people about it. Do you know in all of our official war maps as soon as the country is occupied by Hitler, we paint it black. Austria, black. Czechoslovakia, black. Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, France. All black. That may not even be the end of the list. I know now, those maps are wrong. You can't blackout the human spirit. Why should I tell you that? You know that better than I do. Oh, to all the people I'd like to have told. It's good to tell the truth. It's what my father tried to do here. It's what everyone should try to do all over the world. They hate the truth. Tell me some more about your life. What? You haven't told me how many times you've fallen in love since I saw you last. Do you remember the last time we meet I gave you something to remember me by? Hmm. -You still got it? -Mmh-hmm. It's in my home in London. I hung it up. Because I couldn't get away with it in Piccadilly I did so want to see London. Watch Piccadilly. Eden avenue. The trees, and great blue buildings. Oh. Rather dingy little street. Not even straight. I wouldn't even call it beautiful. Even less not to be... All the same, I would so love to have seen it. [steps approaching] [yelling in German] What's that man putting on the ground over there by the wall? I don't know. It looks like sawdust. [whispering] Oh, no. [steps approaching] [yelling in German] [door opening] The first four hostages, fall out! [yelling in German] [marching away] [yelling in German] -Fire! -[machine gun firing] I do not believe it! I cannot! [sobbing] [yelling in German] [argument in the distance] [alarm buzzing] [several noises] [indistinct dialogue] [shooting] [explosion] [war sounds] -They're coming! -Right.
