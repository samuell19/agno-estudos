MAKE-UP ROOM Director, are you using this room? Umm, no I don't think so. Then can I use it as a make-up room? Go ahead. Tsuzuki-san please use this room. Here you go. Here? It's a bit dark. This is where we usually setup. Muraoka, how many girls today? Five, I guess. It sounds a speciality porn. I just got the script so I haven't had time to read it. Isn't it a regular porn video? Main are two porn actresses, though one looks like a newbie. Plus one more regular actress and 2 others for the kinkier stuff. Maybe an epic porn on a tiny budget. Here's the script and head-shots. I wasn't told that so many girls would be here. The director said he's sending a girl from his office to help. Who's that? Is she really a professional? I didn't ask, but I'd assume so. I'm sure she can do a bit. Oh well. How about bath towels and robes? Here, in this bag. Costumes are in this box. Help yourself to food too. Okay. Don't think I've seen these girls before. Looks like a tough one. We'll be here 'til late. Here you go. Thank you. Good morning! Nice to meet you. Morning. First off here are the make-up tools, got it? Yeah um... I get it. Excuse me, actually I'm one of actresses. Really? Not my make-up assistant? I'm Sugar Sato, a Lolita & cult actress at "Sweet Potato"! Sorry. "Sweet... potato"... Oh, got it. Sorry, I didn't recognise you. That's ok. Morning. If you're here for make-up you better let me know quickly. Umm... I'm an actress too. I'm Kirisaki. I know I'm different from my headshot. Me too, people think I'm a studio manager, especially in the morning. Yeah yeah. Especially when out grabbing lunch. Sorry, I didn't have much time to prepare today. Don't worry about it. Sorry to both of you. Well, put this robe on. The dressing room is over there. Thanks. Um, who should I start with? I've already put on my base makeup. OK. Then let's start with Sugar. You, put this mask on your face please. Ok. - Here - Thanks - Hey Kato-kun. - Yes. Please ask the Director how he envisions the girls? Will do. Do you know what we're shooting today? A widow, her friend, her friend's daughter, her friend's daughter's sister's cousin... It's complicated. Did you read the script? I haven't received it yet. - What? - Me neither. Unbelievable! You better quickly read this. There's a lot of lines. Director says Kirisaki is with-it and up-to-date, Sugar - young and energetic. - The usual then. - Yes. Hey, these 2 haven't gotten the script yet. Sorry! - Here you go. - Thank you. - You're copy. - Thank you. "Deep Heat". Is it a drama? It's a trendy drama. I can't memorize all these. You're the star. It'll be a mess if you can't. Is "High-school Girl" my role? Crap! I've got tons of lines. You'll be fine. High-school girl has natural make-up, so you'll be finished soon. That's good. We are ready to shoot. You ready? Already? That was quick! Give me a bit more time please. How long? We need two girls at the beginning. Give me 20 or 30 minutes or so to get them both ready. OK, I'll tell him that. How about the other make-up artist? Oh, the director says she's stuck on the train due to an accident. I hope she gets here soon. There we go, all done. Thanks for putting on your base make-up. Can you do your eyes yourself? Would be great if you could. Can you? No problem. Thanks. Let's get started. Not much time. Hey, do you need this girl flashier? Should I roll up her hair? Sounds good, please do that. It'll take a little longer. Can't be helped then. Okay, since you've said so I'll start on it. If you roll up my hair then I'll do my face myself. Really? Are you sure? Thanks! Umm, I'm afraid you better soften your eyebrow. You think so? I think this has more impact. No way, the director will blow a fuse. Booo... Good morning. Sorry it's so packed in here. How's it going? We're all ready. I'm still doing her hair, so give me... Don't roll up her hair, it takes too long. But... Which is faster, setting her hair back or rolling it up? Setting it back is easier, though I'll need to straighten it. Okay, I see. Fine, just speed things up! We're all ready to go! I know, I know. Stop pressuring me. Jesus, what are you doing! What do you mean? This is much better. No it's not. Tsuzuki-san, I can't learn my lines at all. Are they shooting this in one take? I have no idea. Maybe they can edit out any mistakes? You'll be fine. Can you read with me? I always memorize my lines with somebody. Err... Okay. "Your father did tragic things to me during his life" I think that kanji is 'terrible', not 'tragic'. "...terrible things to me..." "I'll show your daughter the same pain." "Furious raping. Facial cum." What the hell is "Furious rape"?! If it's too furious I won't do it! And who the hell is Tanabe? An Actor? No clue. Ask the director. He's scary. No, he isn't. He's a nice guy. Every time I have rape scenes I get really down. Don't get down before we start shooting please. Last time, the shoot was outside. It was freezing. I was wounded by dry branch, and it hurt a lot as I couldn't get wet. Didn't you use lubricant? The assistant director stood on it by accident and ruined it. Today it's set inside. Holy moly! Too! Many! Lines! Change into your clothes, girls. Which is mine? A highschool uniform, and Kirisaki-san's. There's no scene number written so I'm not sure myself. I have tattoo on my back. Ok, Let's erase it with some foundation. Let me see. You sure your playing a "Lolita highschool" girl? Does the director know? Well, my manager knows. But your manager wouldn't tell the director. Hey Kato-kun! Kato-kun!! This is fabulous. What's up? Look. Does the director know about this? Yikes. This is bad. I guess he doesn't know. A Lolita shouldn't be like this. Erasing this with foundation won't work if she's raped furiously. You're right. I'll get the director. I always screw with clothes on, or not on all fours. Anyways let's ask the director. Saeki-san, here it is. Have a look. What? Please come here. Jesus! I just heard it was tiny. This is beautifully done. You see, this is more like art than a tattoo. - I see. - When did you get it? Two years ago. Rashness of youth. - Did it hurt? - Like hell! What should we do? This tattoo is too big to erase. Yeah, really. Postures or clothes won't fix this. They need to switch roles. Loan sharks have tattoos so it's natural. There's no choice anyways. Fine with me, but it'll take time. Sugar putting natural make-up won't take long, but Kirisaki will need to start all over, even her hair... How long? I'll do the best as I can, but at least an 1 hour or so. Director, when is good for lunch? I don't care!!! See, he's scary! - You two are switching. - You mean also switching our lines? Yes. But I've already memorised my lines. It's impossible to absorb other lines. Then am I going to be raped!? I wasn't told about that. Let's all try our best, otherwise we can't make this film. I'm bet we'll be here till morning. I've another shoot early tomorrow morning. You're busy. Good. You better earn money while you can. Lunch is here even though we haven't shot anything yet. O-Oh, the rent here is expensive, so let's hurry thing up. Hey, has the main star arrived yet? She should be here by now, right? Not yet. Let me call her manager. Oh, it's him. Hello. Right, she hasn't... Oh, I see. I'm sorry. What's wrong? He said her boyfriend found out she's a porn star and she can't go. How are we going to change scenes when she's the main? Sounds like a real mess. A proper mess, and we're already behind anyway. If I don't get a call from her within an hour then we'll change. Let me call the distribution company. Hello? How's it going? Oh, that's great. Thanks. Her manager reached her. They're on their way. So am I going to be raped? Absorb! Excuse me, but you'd better decide which scene we cut. You decide, idiot! It's your job to tell me what we should do. Me? I stayed up all night to finish writing this script. Asshole! He's scary. It's ok. He's kind to girls. Then why the rape scenes? Because that's his wish. I knew it. Now I'm unmotivated. It might be the distributor's wish. Come on, you can do this. Need more time? I've almost finished. Ok, head to the set after. It's in the front room one floor up. Hey, what about the other make-up artist? I forgot to tell you. She called me and said she arrived at wrong studio. She's coming here now. It's hard to do it all yourself. For this number of girls, we need at least 2 people. My last shoot there was no make up artist. We did it ourselves. No costumes either. I wish you could, but thanks. All set. Change clothes, girls. Yes ma'am. Ok, good. Zip up. Sorry we're late. What are you doing? No. I want to go home now. I don't wanna be in a gangbang film. Why am I in this crappy perverted stuff, dumbass. Behave, please. You'll get the main role next month, so please just do it, ok? - Hello, both of you. - Turn around, girls. Since you've been switched I guess it can't be helped. Alright, sweeties, break a leg. Yes ma'am. Morning. Sorry for being late. This is Masami Ayase. Nice to meet you. The director is? Shooting upstairs. Too bad as I've got to leave for some other meetings. Can I have some? I'm really thirsty from rushing here because of the trouble. Here, you too. Alright I'm off now. Please say hi to director. Call me when you finish. Break a leg. Take care. You too. Ahh...l'm tired. Finally. We were waiting for you. A friend of my boyfriend snitched. What a mess. No...lt's him again... Every second he texts me to check where I am. I gotta go home early. But you're the main. You've got to stay. Really? No way. Seriously. We are behind schedule, so let's finish your make up quickly. Okay. Seriously, I can't take this. Come on, let me make you up now. Put this on. Here's the script. Would you like to shower before your masturbation scene? No thanks. There's the changing room. Thanks. Hey, do you know Yamamoto, the make up artist? You mean Tomiko Yamamoto? Yeah, I know her well. She sucks at putting on make-up. I'm glad she's not here today. Well, I might suck too though. Let's get started. Can you make me look like my head-shot. Well, umm... I'll give it my best. You ok? Rough night? Yeah. Last night I couldn't sleep at all. I'm gonna collapse. Don't tell the director. It'll cause trouble. What's wrong? My pussy is bleeding. That actor fingered me like I was a pinball machine. It might be Metrorrhagia. When you finish go and see a doctor. For now, stop the bleeding with a sponge. Can you put it in? No, I can't. Excuse me, Kato-kun!! Yes! I heard you. I'm coming. How about this size? Then come here. Relax. Don't tighten up. Gentle, please. Let loose. - I can't. - Too narrow. - Gently. - Nice. Good girl. Still hurts. I'm almost... I'm heading back. She kicked me and now I'm bleeding too. You okay? Yeah, by the way, I found a surprise for you. It's half a year old. Hey, don't put it there, throw it away. Oops. By the way, it seems like it'll take longer. She's in pain, so she may not be able to squirt. Then can we let her take a nap? She didn't sleep well last night. Fine, but the other star is coming soon. Is she? Okay, I'll get her ready while she's sleeping. Got it. I'm heading back. I'll call you when I need you. Are they rolling now? It's OK, they're upstairs, so you can talk. That's good. Thanks. Hey, it's Minazuki, right? Yeah Tsuzuki-san! Great to see you, it's been ages! You changed your name. I couldn't even recognise your head-shot. Right. I worked with several distributors as a singular actress, but now I'm a speciality actress. I changed my agent too. Nice to see you again. Me too. I thought you retired. Yeah, I retired half a year ago, and... By the way, listen! My ex was hunted by the police doing bank transfer scam calls. So we escaped to Okinawa. I've was prostituting there, and then I came back. Maybe I love this industry. I'm glad to hear that. How are we doing? Behind schedule. Lots of things happened. I see. I'm Masako, written using alphabets. Good to see you. Hi, Masako. I'm Tsuzuki, your make up artist. Can you sit there? I'll come back to you. Can I use this? Sure. Read it while you're waiting. Is she Masami Ayase? You know her? Yes. I've always wanted to meet her. I've never seen her films, but her pictures attracted me. What a fantastic day! She's tired due to some trouble with her boyfriend. I understand as I used to have quite a public profile too, So I ran into a lot of trouble. Sometimes nobody recognises you when you're the most popular, and vice-versa. It's hard to tell. Minazuki... what's your new name again? It's Masako written by alphabets. Did "Masako written by alphabets"' parents find out about your job? First, "written by alphabets" is not part of my name. Really? Second, yes. I had some problems with my parents. Especially dad. But I said, "Hey dad. Your daughter loves being filmed having sex". He said nothing. He still says nothing to me even when go home for funerals. I'm sorry. As I said, I'm loving everything I do now. Didn't you go crazy chasing a playboy? Yeah, I wasn't right in the head. Spending money on him made me feel loved. Money was all I had. Now getting laid on set is the best boyfriend ever. I prefer to satisfy my sexual desire rather than be a normal person. So you'll stay in this industry? Yeah, it's fun for the most part. Besides, there's "mature" category which I can be in someday. I'm now planning how to get there from my "Lolita" start. Recently, many porn stars have much longer life spans. Hey, are you the only make up artist here? Unfortunately, the assistant hasn't arrived yet due to a delayed bus and going to the wrong place. Can I help? Thanks. Just relax and sit there. The shoot is taking a while. I'll apply my base then. Actually, I've done almost all of it at home. You've saved me. - You've passed. - Huh? You're not as bad as Tomiko. I knew it once you put on a dab of foundation. My stomach... I'm on my period. You okay? Need some medicine? No thanks. Lay down. You need a nap. No, I don't. Yes, you do. I've always been in poor health. Hello, Masami. How are you? I'm good. Nice to meet you. I'm Masako, who's having sex with you today. What? A lesbian scene? Nobody told me that. But it's written in the script. You just forgot. Look. I've just had my nails done. How gorgeous. Lesbians do hard fingering, you know. At my last shoot, the director made me cut them off. Not again... My poor gorgeous nails... I know. I'm sorry. - I'll be in a bad mood. - It'll be fine. Read the script as you've lots of lines. The director will get mad. Get ready and give it your best. Come on, stand up. Here's the costume, change there. Move, move. Hey. How did it go? Yeah, better. Although his huge cock hurt like hell. I'm done for today anyway. Well done, Kirisaki-chan. Go take a shower. Suger-chan, you're next. Take a shower before and fix your make-up. We won't have time for lunch, but help yourself to these bentos. Thanks How's it going, Ms. Ayase? We are ready. Which scene are we doing? A little dialogue before masturbating with Sugar watching. Umm, I'm gonna shower before that. Mr. Saeki said you don't have to take off your lingerie. But I want a shower. Can anybody take out the sponge in me? Coming. Then do it quickly while I take out her sponge. Yeah. Now, I'm coming. What the hell are we waiting for?! Great to see you, sir. Hello, gorgeous. I'm sorry about your boyfriend. You okay? Feeling better? Slept well? Had lunch? Oh, it's already afternoon. I never slept well the night before shooting, but I'm fine now. Good. Let's shoot your masturbation scene then. Although, I haven't had a shower yet. You kidding me? Then do it right now. Excuse me, sir. Neither have I. Oh no! Muraoka, are there any other shower rooms? There's another upstairs. Then can you go upstairs? Yes, sir. Muraoka, come here. Yes. Why hasn't she showered yet? I thought she had already. It's my fault. Idiot. You should've read the script and planned it, Tsuzuki-san. Sorry. - All done. - Already? That was quick. I'm always this quick. Can somebody pass me a toothbrush? Sure. I'll bring one. Nice to meet you. I'm Saeki, the director. Hi, Mr. Saeki. I'm Masako. Nice to meet you too. I can't wait. Do you remember me? We worked together once. - Well... - Well, you don't need to. I'm too normal for 93% of people to remember. Why don't you kill time reading your script. Sweety Sugar, come upstairs when you finish. I'll tell you what to do. Yes, sir. Muraoka, bring Ayase-chan upstairs right away. Can I have one of these? I guess so, but leave one kind of each forAyase to choose. Then I'll take the biggest one. I'll take one too. Let me pick one too. I'll save it for you. - This fish one. - Break a leg. Let's go, Sugar. That picky director is confusing. Have you worked with him before? He said we had, but I don't remember it at all. He asks me to be seductive, so I do it, but keeps saying "Wrong!" That's common. I'm so hungry. That fish is definitely mine. I'll save it for you. Now, everyone's waiting for you upstairs. Good luck, Ayase-san. Sugar can't eat that now. She's rude. When I was a main porn star, I was like that I was a prima donna. You were a main porn star? I don't believe it! Well, how could you say that! Why is that woman a main and I'm a speciality. I'm much nicer than her. I wish I was a main. No matter how attractive you are, you must do lots of promotion. That's why my manager told me I can't be. I don't wanna be on TV or in newspapers. Okey-dokey. I'm finally ready for lunch. This is for Ayase-chan. I'm Sawada from Disaster Promotion. Is this Saeki's film? Yes. Is she the newbie? Toshiko. Her real name till she gets her stage name. Our president will come up with it soon. I'm Tsuzuki, her make-up artist. Nice to meet you. Let's put some make-up on. You're on as soon as they finish. Are you nervous? Yes. I'll be with her the whole day today. Plus I'll get her stage name sorted. Now put this on. May I have one? - Maybe. - Why not. Well, well, well... Hey. Minazuki, right? Long time no see. - How are you? - I'm a manager now. Really? - I appreciate what you did. - Anytime. You know him? He used to be a porn actor. When we had a scene together, I was too young and didn't know what I was doing. Also, I was sweating like a pig. I made a huge lake in her cleavage. Those were the days. Sorry about that. What a sexy neckless. Whoa, whoa, whoa. The changing room is over there. I should've taken you there. My bad. Please have a seat here. You needn't be so nervous. Everyone here is nice. Thanks... - Excuse me... - Yes? What do I do for the scene? Don't you know? I only heard the outline. But I don't know what do to. I'm sure Mr. Saeki will explain nicely. Anything to drink? Thanks. - How about water? - Thanks. Here you are. Thank you very much. You okay? Yes. All finished? The guy came in seconds, so we finished early. My erotic glance might have helped. We've wrapped early. Has new actress been... I'm doing it now. Hello. Do you mind if we shoot some scenes here? Next interview scene? Which side? This side unfortunately... I appreciate it. You shower too quickly. You shouldn't take so long. It might kill the good bacteria in your vagina and cause a STD. Wait, my fish bento? Sorry, there's only one left. I'm allergic to meat... Thanks for waiting guys. We're about to start. Hello. I'm Saeki, the director. The first time can be hard, but you'll be fine. Nice to meet you. Which direction do you want to shoot? Well, well, well... Which side should I shoot? Nooooo, I don't see any better direction than this way. Then the other side. Both sides? We'll use that side to shoot Ayase being hunted by a loan shark. Anywhere you won't use? No. We'll move around a lot. Are you Mr. Saeki? Yeah. I'm Sawada from Disaster Promotion. How are you? Good. Have you come up with her stage name? Not yet. I came up Taka Matsuko due to her willingness, but the president didn't like it, so he'll get in touch when he's thought of a better name. But we need her stage name to shoot her scene. Everyone, this way, please. Set it up quickly please. Director, which side? This side for the interview scene. Everyone, please move next door. What? You're shooting here? Do we need to move all our stuff? Yes Too slow. Hurry up! - Do you need her in lingerie too? - Nope. Move this table. Saeki, why did you choose this side? - My mind is made up on it. - All made up... - Sorry. - What a pain. Ready, and Hey, watch out! Set up a seat. Hey, Kato! Director, is this chair OK? Umm, yeah. You don't need a monitor, right? R... Right. Too close! What kind of interview is it? Firstly just introduce yourself. Thanks for waiting. - Good luck. - Ready. Have a seat there. Let's try this interview. What should I say? Umm, bust/waist/hip measurements, your hometown, etc... I don't know my body measurements. Mr. Sawada. Tell her. Ah, yes... Bust 82cm, Waist 59cm, Hips 85cm. Once again "Bust 59cm... Wrong. If her bust is 59cm then she's comically flat. Oh. 82, 59, 85. We're waiting. Let's roll. It won't take long. Relax. Camera ready? - OK start rolling. - I fucking am! Is somebody's taking a shower? It's Ayase-san. She taking ages. Excuse me, could you be be quiet! Picture up. - Ready. - Rolling. Action! - Hi. - Hello. - Are you nervous? - Yes Please introduce yourself. My bust is 59cm, and... Cut. It's awkward for her to start with her size. Usually we start with her name. If her bust is 59cm then she's got nothing going on. We need her name. Could you call him now? Sure. Voicemail. Jesus! Postpone this scene. No name, no interview. - Shall we shoot the drama part now? - Yeah, let's do it. Can't we use the same side? It looks almost the same. Are you blind? The door is on that side. "Masami runs in from the door." Is written in the script! Yes, but it takes... Excuse me, Ayase is still... What HE SAYS is what WE DO! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys. Move it. - OK. - Let's move. Kato, move it. Quicker. Ready, and! - Slowly, please. - Be careful. After we'll move it back. Saeki, Is the door in? No. Wrong, yes, it's in! This way. This table too. Got it. Somebody help. Ready, and... - Kato. - Got it. I'm Ayase-chan escaping from this direction. She'll sigh like this. You don't need to act. Continue. Then a loan shark chases her from there to here, to the wall like this. There. Continue. With this facial expression. I couldn't care less... Just tell me the positions. - He - Is there the Loan Shark. Who cares. Positions! Like this, see? Yeah. And then, comes, comes, comes... - Who's coming? - The loan shark! Oh, shark. The loan shark. That's it. Stop in the centre? Yes, here. Then the loan shark... I thought you were still rolling the interview. I waited in the shower. Tsuzuki-san! My goodness! It was like a sauna there and all my make-up ran. Tsuzuki-san! Fix her make-up now! Quickly! I'm so sorry. Hello? Mr. Saeki. Yes. I see. Thanks, I'll tell them. He decided on her stage name, Taka Matsuko! That's what you already chose!! He said he couldn't come up with anything better. Son of a! Again! Start from the interview!! Move everything back. Hurry. Hurry. Kato. Take this. And the table. Move it, Kato. The same as before. Ready, and... Mr. Saeki, the same chair again? Yeah. Wait. Where is she? Matsuko? You're next. Oh no! She's balling up! Ayase-chan is ready. Alright, start from Ayase's scene, again! Ayase-chan runs in like this. As she runs in she sighs like this, The loan shark stands there like this. He comes like this, guys. That's how he goes. Watch. Nobody's watching, even Ayase. Ayase-chan! Come here. Come by me. Closer to me! Here! Here You. This side. Come like this, and you sigh like this. But the loan shark has already snuck in... Who's the actor? Him. Mr. Saimon. What?! Seriously? "A middle-aged loan shark" is written in the script. But you said "Anyone can do it because he won't have sex." Right. But, he's too frail... Have you acted before? Ah... Yes... Not so many times... but you'll see. We'll see... So Ayase runs in. Then you come out from behind. Ok, let's run through it. Go outside, Ayase. Please. Ok, test! Ready. Action! What should I do? A loan shark kidnapped my mum, dad, and sister. I'm all that's left. No, I'm not. I have Toshiko, my friend... Cut. Could you change "Toshiko" to "Matsuko"? Ah, yeah. Ok. Don't you think she explains it too much? What do you think? Me? I don't know. It actually sounds descriptive although she's talking herself, We've already cut most of the scene. Without her lines it doesn't make any sense why Masami comes here. Right. Keep it as it is. It's endless. Yeah... Let's keep moving. Yes. Alright, let's try again. From the line "I have Matsuko". Roll camera. Action! I have Matsuko, my friend. I must find her no matter how. Ha... Ha. It... Is... Bad. You! CUT!! You are HORRIBLE!! Hey!! Come on, man!! She's doing spectacular work, but you're spoiling it! I told you I've hardly acted... but it'll be fine. His penis is very talented though. Hard cock, silky cum, amazing load. Those are fuckin' USELESS here!! Ok. Let's fade out the scene on her frightened face. I'll run an explanation on screen. Is that what you want? We've no choice as we're fucking BEHIND schedule!! We haven't shot any PORN yet!! Saeki, I filmed the test last time, you can use everything before "I have Matsuko". You did? Thank God! Now for the close up. Start from the line "I have Matsuko" Zooming in. - Ready. - Set. - Rolling. - Action! I have my friend, Matsuko!! What should I do now? CUT!! Do NOTHING. Stay there!! You're not in camera!! How much of that is useable? It's ok if you don't mind fading out the scene. Not at all. That's a wrap. Quickly on to Matsuko's scene!! Got it. I'll be next door. Saeki, are you done with Saimon? You doing anything afterwards? No, sir. If not, then stay here and work. Move, move. Sorry I kept you waiting, Matsuko. We're going to shoot your interview. You remember your sizes? Yes, I remember. Can you answer my sexual questions? ...Sexual questions? I don't know, Can I lie? Because if I... "When did you pop your cherry?" "Where do you like being touched?" Nobody can figure out who you are by those answers. Ready to go. - Picture up. - Ready. - Speed. - Rolling. Action! - Hello. - Hi. What's your name? I'm Taka Matsuko. Cut! Fucking Ambulance!! Stay till it passes. They're coming for you, Muraoka. Oops! I gotta say"Hi". Shut up. - Ok, gone. - Let's go. - Picture up. - Rolling. Action! - Hello. - Hi. What's your name? I'm Taka Matsuko. Cut! Shit!! Now, a helicopter!! Every time we start rolling, there's... Sniper, Shoot it down! Aye-aye, Captain!! Shut up you idiots! We'll never MOVE ON!! Ok, it's gone! Let's move on. - Picture up. - Rolling. - Speed. - Action! Hot Dogs, Hot Dogs - Hello. - Hi. What's your name? - I'm Taka Matsuko. - Get your hot dogs! Cut! What the hell is that?! Why am I so unlucky?! Hey, Kato, go outside and check. No problem. He's gone. Finally. Let's wrap it up. - Picture ready. - Rolling. Action! - Hello. - Hi. What's your name? I'm Taka Matsuko. What the! Something tripped the breaker! I'm not using that much power. I bet there's a short. Ouch! Where the switch? Kato! Be careful of the camera! Oops. Safe, everyone? I can't see... It's ok. I'll roll in night mode. - Really? - Yeah Let's roll! - Ready. - Rolling. Action! Ah, there's no night mode... What are we waiting for? There's nothing to eat! How about these? No, garlic chips give you bad breath. We have kissing scenes! Why would they buy these? Doesn't it say the package photos start in the afternoon? But it's already evening, almost morning. I have a shoot tomorrow. No way. I don't wanna directly go from here. I wanna go home. You have filming tomorrow! Good. Not really. I've been so busy my skin is a mess. Thanks for waiting. We're all ready to go. How long will it take? Not long since we don't have time. I don't want any ridiculous demands please. I'll tell the photographer. Ready girls? Alright, go for it. Let's go. Muraoka-kun, Call me if you need something. Thanks. Hey, what's wrong? I'm not needed. Why? It's for the sleeve pack-shot, right? But I'm not needed. I see. They should've told you that first. They just told me. They're concerned about the design. Then, I'm not needed. Whenever I'm on the pack-shot, I'm always on the edges. Or in the last row of a group photo In auditions I'm always told "you're interesting" but not picked. It's been a long time since I've been in a film. I always work as a call girl. Really? I wanted to believe that I had worth as a woman. I was recruited off the street. I don't know why they picked me. I was hesitant to... be naked at first. Then I made up my mind, but couldn't get a job. How come? Maybe because I'm tall, fat, and ugly? No, that's not true. Maybe there just wasn't a job that suited you. Because I'm ugly. People say I look like a camel. Well, I don't think so. Once while shooting a sex scene we had to wait for the actor to get hard. He told me not to look at him. That's so rude. I'm sorry to moan and groan. Sorry, I'm always like this. Well, I'm done for today, right? Yeah. Sorry for making you wait. That's ok. I'm leaving. Say bye to everyone from me. Looking forward to seeing you soon. Bye. Take care. Is Kirisaki done already? Good for her. Sorry for the inconvenience. What's wrong? She nearly broke her back due to some ridiculous demands so she started to cry. Are you okay? Yes. I'm okay now. Excuse me, silly porn actors always touching me when taking photos. Nobody says anything. It drives me fucking crazy. The director usually stops it when he sees it. You should tell him. Can you tell that to the director? Alright... It's your turn, Matsuko. Why don't you prepare for the next scene? Come here. OK. Have a seat. Are there staff members watching the sex scenes? Well, yeah. But most people are used to it. The porn actor... what does he look like? Let me see. It's Mikimoto who is young and handsome. He's also gentle, so just let him do it. I've never acted before. Everyone is the same their first time, don't worry. Those marks mean I'm starring? Yes. It's called "a call sheet". Which makes shooting more fun. Let's take a look. Yes. What's the next costume? Well... room wear. Yeah, that's it. You're a fast learner. - Why don't you read the script then? - Yes. Here they are. These are my lines... Just "..." and "Yes." Really? You're lucky. After finishing find your socks, ok? Yes. Matsuko, are you finished? She's coming. - Alright, you ready? - Yes. Take it easy. Good luck. Tsuzuki-san... Will she be OK? She started to cry when just taking a photo... Is she really okay with sex? Well, she should be fine. Can you guys set the mood? Yeah, we'll do it. She's so pure. I was like that in my first scene. With pubic hair? I'm not that old!! But, for the first time, I stripped without hesitating, and the director told me "can you be a little more shy?" That was tricky. People who are confident are lucky. They can last longer. You're right. Lolita for young babes, cosplay for my generation, I want a hourglass shape. I need to do something! You're like a real actor! Yeah! People often say so. I'm great at giving hand jobs and prostatic massages. I once made a actor's cum touch the ceiling. Also, I can make any pussy squirt with a fantastic technique. I can't wait to do it with Ayase. Oh yeah, we're going to do it. You hate lesbian scenes? Not really... Do I really have to cut my nails? That length is a weapon. A bloody pussy is a big seller for the speciality scene. Are you gonna cut them now? Okay... I don't wanna cut my nails. They cost 30,000 yen. It can't be helped. She was crying the whole time she was acting. Are you alright? You just got nervous, right? It's your first time. It'll be ok. The director said it was OK, and she suddenly started to cry. She thinks that she can be better. What's wrong? The director said it's ok, so it's ok. But the director told me "Well... it's okay." Hello? The director's strict. He often says "Well, it's okay" I've been told the same so many times. The director saying 'Ok' means it's OK. So, it's fine. Come here and take a rest. Yes... Ayase, you are so kind. No, I just want to finish early. I hope there won't be trouble for the sex scene. Well... Hello. - Hi. - Boss! I was a bit worried. Oh, okay. I just came up with a good name. Mr. Furin, we already started shooting as "Taka Matsuko." Really... too late... Just kidding. More importantly, When Toshiko shot a sex scene, she's started crying. Really?? Then, I'll leave it to you. Okay. Oh, hey, please stay!! Just kidding. Toshiko. Hey? Don't you like your name? That part!? - No? - Definitely not. Then what? How is Matsuko? I see... Then can we start shooting Ayase and Masako's lesbian scene? Okey-dokey. I'm scared. Let's go. Excuse me... I'll do it. I don't want to cause trouble. You don't have to try too hard. It's not too hard. I'll do it. - Are you really okay? - Yes. Okay, let's go. Is she really okay? She might cry and come back again. She'll be fine. I believe in her. You're not gonna watch her? Well, it won't change anything if I go. I don't think she wants me to see her naked. Is that Matsuko?! Oh my God!! She's doing great!! I've gotta see this! Me too. I am... a bit curious. No worries. I told you. Why does Matsuko make her debut in this speciality porn? Because it's getting more competitive in the industry. There are more attractive porn stars than TVidols. We tried with the beautiful Toshiko, but couldn't find much work. Therefore, we'll start with her collaborating with Masami Ayase to raise her profile. It's her first step. The crying Matsuko is now doing this. I never expected that. She said she has hardly had sex before either. But I'm good at capturing the essence of girls. Off the record though, I'm pretty sure she's a nympho. Incredible! Totally different! Unbelievable! Holy cow! You were amazing! Your voice was spectacular. I love it. Ms. Tsuzuki. I fucked. I heard your moaning here. Really? I'd never imagine that. Everyone in the neighbourhood heard you too. No kidding. You gave me a boner. You did a good job. Thank you very much. Now take a shower. This is too hot for me. Now, we'll cut the lesbian scene because it's too late. Wait. What?! Each of you has fucked at least once. Besides, I asked the film distributor and he said it was ok. So let's move on to scene 25. Get ready. Fuck! Give me back my nails! Damnit! I haven't been fucked yet. We put your hand job at the beginning of scene 25. Show us your great technique. A handjob? No one will fuck me today?? No. What the fuck! I don't wanna masturbate alone at home again! But I heard your technique is the best ever. Your wrist movement and perfect hand grip. May I watch and learn? May I? Of course. Yay! How do you usually masturbate? I use a vibrator and an electric massager. I love to use a shower head. So do I. Ayase-chan After texting, take a shower. Then I'll fix your make-up. Ah... you can do it now. No hurry. Your nails... It might be my fault that you cut them off. Oh, it's ok. The desire for nails doesn't need to be the end. Like "More gorgeous. More expensive." So you showed me the end. Thanks. I see... Hey, has your boyfriend trouble been resolved? I guess so. That's good. Yeah... When I started dating him, I couldn't keep lying, so I confessed. He got mad at me. But I said, "If you can't deal with it, then I'm leaving you." He forgave me in the end. He doesn't have much money. He's a struggling actor. To help him succeed, I need to support him financially. Besides, I'm not smart enough to avoid tax though I work hard. In addition, my mum asks me to pay my sister's tuition. People around you know your job. You must have mixed feelings. Yeah, I do. Well, some people still don't know though. I was never like this in the past. Since I came into this industry, I've had responsibility, dignity, and a rational point of view, But I've lost the modest behaviour Matsuko has. I don't want her to become full of herself. Are you saying you are? I think I am. Don't you think so? I'm not saying... The more generously they treat me, the more selfish I become. Everyone gets whatever I wanna eat or drink for me. To keep me in a good mood. You asked Kato to buy the jar of garlic chips, right. Of course! There's a grand finale in sight. Shoots are always such long days. Well... I like it though. Living by myself is so lonely. So I have sex, and sex, and sex... To fill something empty in my soul. I guess. I want to prove my existence, no matter how and be recognised by someone who loves me. It sounds funny and pointless saying it half-naked, huh? I wouldn't say that. That stupid actor shot cum at me!! Ouch! My eye!! He said nothing when he came. Cum in your eyes? I'll get you eye drops. Why didn't you call me? Are you okay? You too, Matsuko. Watch out for facial cum. Whoa! So red!! Oh, fuck. I wish I at least had sex. Hold it, ok? I'm so sorry about your eye!! I must apologize. Just leave. Ayase-san, are you ready for your scene? Yep. Here I go. Please "come" hard for me. Yes, ma'am. I'll try. Good luck. Watch out for facial cum. I will. Thank you. I'll perform as good as you, Matsuko. Let's go. What a heartwarming moment. That's why we'll never stop working on porn. - You okay? - It hurts. Excuse me, Can I borrow a hair dryer? I took a shower and my hair is wet. Sure. Go ahead. It's morning already. This room gets no sun. It's hard to figure out the time of day. I'm off today, but Sugar has another shoot from now, right? I'm going home to take a nap as it starts in the afternoon. What are they shooting? I don't know yet. What? Are you sure? It doesn't sound like a safe production to me. I know... but I can't be picky. There aren't many jobs for a struggling actress. Alright then, thank you for supporting her. Thank you, everyone. Not at all. See you soon. Of course. Thank you so much. Take care of yourself. Great work today. Bye. See you again on another film. Definitely! I promise. Hey, Mr. Furin. Please wake up. Get up. Mr. Furin, we are leaving! Done? Yes. Bye girls. Bye, Mr. Furin. Matsuko should get very busy soon. How come? Because she'll get endless offers once she's made her debut. But a speciality actress gets offered whatever she says she will do. Good to know. Get in a cab, Ayase-san. Masako and Sugar, get in ourtruck please. Truck seats hurt my butt. Sorry. Tsuzuki-san, you have your own car, right? Hey, where's Matsuko? She's already gone. What?! She didn't say anything to me! Alright, come outside as soon as you're ready. I hope to see you soon. Me too. Thank you. Take care. Both of you wait in the car please. I'm leaving too. Great working with you. Thanks a lot. You're welcome. Wake up earlier next time. Oops! You found out... Did you know that I don't have a boyfriend? ...I didn't know that. Oops. I dug my own grave. Nice to see you. Bye Bye. Take care. Do you have any shooting today? No. I'm off today. How about you? Yeah. Got a meeting soon. Tough life. Where's the studio? Guess what. It's here. Mr. Morikawa's piece. His direction is always confusing. I feel sorry for you. Where's everyone? They've all left. Why is that?! Nobody said anything to me. Tsuzuki-san! Morikawa's group will arrive here soon. Please head outside. I'm coming! Hey, should I turn off lights? Just leave it. What happened to the other make-up artist? Guess what she's... Guess what she's... Director, will you use this room?
