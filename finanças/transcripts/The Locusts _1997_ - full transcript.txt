My baby whispers in my ear Mmm Sweet nothin's He knows the things I like to hear Mmm Sweet nothin's Things he wouldn't tell Nobody else Secret, baby, I keep 'em to myself Sweet nothin's Mmm Sweet nothin's We walk along hand in hand Mmm Sweet nothin's Yeah, we both understand Mmm Sweet nothin's Sittin' here peaceful, trying to read my book My baby give me that special look Sweet nothin's Mmm We was naked as a couple of jaybirds, and then Kitty's mom pulls up. We were not. Oh, that's... That's right, honey. I was the only one who was naked, and you just had your skirt pulled up to your goddamn neck. Hey, Joel, for... For chrissake, huh? Joel? Change the subject. Thank you. A change of underwear is more like it. God, if you don't shut up... Oh, my god! Oh, are you hurt? You oughtn't to be throwing things, Kitty. I am...I'm so sorry. Um, can I...Can i-i get you a beer? Another one? Harlan, a beer. Well, you can make it 2. Have a seat. Watch out for the glass! Thanks, Harlan. Shouldn't be standing in the way there, son. Joel, shut up. It was your fault, anyway. Don't mind him. He doesn't have any manners. By the way, my name's Kitty. And this is patsy and Earl. Hi. Hey, shit for brains! Why don't you move away from my girl? Joel, knock it off. Are you with buffalo Bob? Aah! Hey, hey! All right. Hey, hey! Come on, you're done, champ. Let's go. Don't mind us. I didn't catch your name. No. You might want to move along now. Thanks for your help. Joel's a panic when he gets drunk. You wouldn't happen to know of any work around here or anything, would you? No. Well, it was a long shot, I guess. Thanks again, guys. Where are you coming from? Saint Joe. Broke, huh? Well, no, not exactly. I...I have $7 in my pocket. Where are you headed? California. What are you doing in sealy? Well, I thought I'd drop in on my aunt em and my uncle Henry. You see, they live just up the road a piece. It's been so long since I've spent any time. I don't get it. Oh, it's a joke, honey. You know, a regional- type...Given-the-area joke. No. I-I don't get how you plan on making it to California on $7. Well, I thought I would use this and then some better jokes... And then, California, here I come. Well, uh, anyway, Earl and, ah, patsy... It was very nice meeting you guys. Good luck. Thanks. Ahem. Well, maybe there's something at the ashford place. What's the Ashfords? Feedlot where I work. Where just about every guy in town works. Think they'll hire me? I never worked with cows or anything like that. Oh, I-I think she'll probably hire you. Who's "she"? Mrs. Delilah ashford Potts. She owns the place. Well, the best part is, there's an empty carriage house you can probably stay in. I mean, well, nobody's living there now, is there, Earl? Nobody since Calvin. Yeah. Who's Calvin? A ranch hand. He moved into the carriage house after Mr. Potts died. No. No. You mean after flyboy was gone. Who's flyboy? Oh, her son. Well, he just got back from the state institution last Christmas after... Well, how long was he there, Earl? 8 years, I'd guess. Yeah. You know, I think I'll have that smoke now, actually. You really think she'll hire me? Let me stay there and all? If I know her, she'll give you a room, a job, and a whole lot more than you never bargained for. She loves city boys. Eats them for breakfast. Jesus, what's that smell? Feedlot's got a powerful aroma. Seeps into your skin after a while. What is it, Earl? Sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Potts, but, uh... I got a fellow here who has a question for you. Well? Hello. Yes, what is it? Well, I was looking for a job and, uh... A place to stay, and Earl here thought you might be able to help me out with both. You ever work on a feedlot? No, actually, I haven't ever worked on a... Feedlot before. You ever work with cattle in any capacity? No. Then why would I want to hire you? Look, Earl said that you might be able to use an extra hand, but if that's not the case, then I guess... Is that the case, Earl? Do we need an extra hand? Well, ma'am, we could use the help, this being the heavy season, but...it isn't absolutely necessary. Well, then, is this Mr., uh... Hewitt. Hewitt...the man for the job? Well, ma'am, he appears strong enough. Where do you come from, Mr. Hewitt? Saint Joe. Yes. Well, the, uh... Carriage house is unlocked. Everything should be in order. The last tenant was very...Tidy. We'll discuss conditions and duration of your stay tomorrow. Now, is there anything else, gentlemen? It's...rather late. No, ma'am. Thank you. Mr. Hewitt? Breakfast is at 6:00. Guess she recognizes a good man when she sees one, huh? She's just got you figured for a bull, that's all. You know what happens to bulls on a feedlot? What's that? Ha ha! The carriage house is there. Get some sleep. You're gonna be working like a country boy tomorrow. Thanks again, Earl, for everything. I appreciate it. Have a good night. Something very strange and mystic happened to me something realistic and as weird is happening something that I feared somehow is now is near to me what a funny feeling, how it gets to you did anything like this ever happen to you did you ever see a dream walking? What are you doing here? Well, I figured I’d do some cattle ranching. What part of St. Joseph are you from? Well, ma'am, I could... I could tell you, but I’m...I'm sure you, ah, sure you don't know it. We're not ranchers. I own a feedlot. Thank you. That your son? Though I'm not entirely clear as to your background, Mr. Hewitt, I am certain that you were not raised to speak while others are eating. 'Morning. 'Morning, Earl. Merry Christmas. Thanks. Guess me and you got off on the wrong foot last night. You're still here. I thought country folk were supposed to be friendly. Simple-minded and backward maybe... But at least friendly. Are you looking for it, slick? 'Cause if you are, it's in stock. That right? That's right. You have a good day. See them over in lot 6? They've just about reached slaughter weight. Slaughter weight? About 1,100 pounds. A couple weeks, trucks come and haul them off. A couple more weeks, they'll be cheeseburgers. What kind of steer is that? That's Jim. He ain't no steer, though. That's a first-class bull. Only one on the lot. He's getting on to be 20 years old. Way past slaughter weight, wouldn't you say? Oh, he's a pet. Belonged to Mr. Potts. Didn't have nothing to do with this feedlot, except for that bull. He'd come home from teaching school, and he and flyboy would just sit out there for hours with Jim. That bull is the only thing that boy talks to since he come back. Come on. Hey, Hewitt. They must have sat you at the wrong table. This one's only for simple, backward folk. Why's he got that apron on? I guess she makes him wear it. Said he went crazy when his dad died? He hung himself. Hush up. Which? Who hung himself? His daddy hanged himself in that tree over there. Sheriff cut him down, and flyboy grabbed the noose. Disappeared for over a week. Finally, she had him put away. How'd he get out? State couldn't hold him once he come of age, so...they sent him home. Why'd his daddy hang himself? Said he found Mrs. Potts and Calvin going at it one evening when he came home. Calvin? Is that that boy from the carriage house? Yeah. Only he wasn't living here yet. He just worked here. And he was 16. And he wasn't the first, neither. Just the last straw, I guess. But she's got a taste for those young'uns. Why don't you dipshits shut up about Delilah? She ain't got a taste for nothing. Well, she's sure been developing a taste for you. Ooh! Well, then she's been developing some mighty fine taste lately. Ho! Ho! Ho! What's for dessert, darlin'? Hmm? All right. Go on. See my friend here? He don't talk too much. Shock treatments. He just went in the house with her. Yeah. So they're, uh... They ain't doing dishes. "No one gets out of here in one piece." What? The inscription. My father. He wasn't one to mince words. The first thing he said to his troops when they landed in Cuba... "No one gets out of here in one piece." Made the goddamn papers. He was in the, ah, Spanish-American war? He was a hero. Must have been a great man. Do you always dress this nicely for dinner? Only on special occasions. I'm impressed. Change before we eat. Brought a few other shirts just as dirty as this one. Didn't exactly bring a wardrobe with me. Pack in a hurry? Stay there. Does your son do the cooking? Yes. So why doesn't he eat in here with us? Why don't we ask him? Not yet. Mr. Hewitt was simply curious as to why you seem to spend so much time in the kitchen. We thought we might ask you. Are we to take this to mean that you're uncertain as to why you're in the kitchen? Very well. You may take my plate. Perhaps we'd better not ask too many questions... Had we? That sure is a handsome bull. Yes, sir, that's about the handsomest bull I've seen in all my days of cattle ranching. Now, look... I'm not going to believe that the only thing you talk to is that bull. My name's Clay. I believe this belongs to your father. Who's there? Who's there? Shit! Fuck. You awake? Sorry about that. What for? I mean, if you can't wake him, just hit him in the head with a rock, right? Oh, my god. Did I do that? No, you didn't do this. You just broke the glass, that's all. I'm...I'm the one who stepped on it. My fault. Where are we going? Does it matter? By the way, where's your friend Joel? He passed out hours ago. So where are we? Sealy's answer to lovers' Lane. It's pretty, isn't it? Yeah, it's nice. ...that I'll adore tell me you love me tell me you're mine once more once more, once mo-o-ore each night I count the stars in the sky hoping that you aren't telling me lies you're with me tonight I'm captured by your charms oh, pretty baby won't you hold me in your arms a thousand stars in the sky make me realize you are the one love that I'll adore tell me you love me tell me you're mine once more once more, once mo-o-re Each night I count the stars in the sky hoping that you aren't telling me lies you're with me tonight I'm captured by your charms oh, pretty baby won't you hold me in your arms Ahh... Ah. Make me realize ahh, ah. Tell me you love me tell me you're mine once more i-i-I'm yours And the stars sure are out tonight. It's clear, with a temperature of 78 degrees... I don't like to get a girl naked on the first date. Ow! Jesus Christ... I forgot about your head. I'm sorry. You're a hazard, you know that? Here. Drink this. Thank you. So... Why are you still here? Just staying to get some money. Then I'm out of here. I'm sure patsy filled you in on all of that. Not everything. Why'd you leave St. Joe? Bored. I see. Is there something wrong with that? I just thought you might have gotten into some trouble. What makes you think that? I can see behind those eyes of yours, Clay Hewitt. Don't kid yourself. Why do you, uh... Cut their balls off? You gotta, to get 'em to gain the right kind of weight. Also makes 'em easier to manage. Like turning a lion into a lamb. Jason, why don't you, ah, hand him a drencher? Now, go on, put it in his mouth. Pull the trigger. What's next? All right, just like I showed you, you just slip that over his horn there. Watch yourself there. All done. Well, Jake's got that, so uh... Hey, what's the problem in here? The chute's backed up to lot 12. Oh, never mind. 2 points. What's the matter, Hewitt? Just gonna have a cigarette. Good evening, Mr. Hewitt. Ma'am. Would you care for a drink? What do you have? Bourbon. Thanks. Still overdressing for dinner, I see. It's water. It's not sweat. And a splash of color. Is my hem coming out? What? My hem. Is it coming out? I don't see anything. Thank you. You're welcome. Jesus Christ! Hey! Hey! Uh! Aah! I, uh... I, um... Just tripped a little bit on... On the thing out there. This is quite a place you got here, fly. Do you mind if I sit down here? Thanks. Thank you. Are, uh...These your records? No. They were my father's. Hmm. You... You can hear one. A record? Yeah, go ahead. Slip one of those records on. Ok. Thank you. I appreciate that. It's catchy. It's nice. This is a picture of you and your father here, huh? He was a schoolteacher or something, wasn't he? Sure is a nice place you got here... Biology. I'm sorry? He, uh... He taught biology in school. H-He was a biology teacher? Those are his books. How to know the insects by r.J. Humphrey. "Property of Evan Potts..." And, ah, "Joseph Potts." Who's that? Who's Joseph Potts? How'd you get the name flyboy? My grandfather called me that. Why? Were you born with wings? No. No, um... Freddy was called that. Freddy flew planes. He flew planes, so they called him that. Wait. Ah, who's... Who's Freddy? Freddy's my mom's brother. Freddy...Freddy's your uncle. And they...They called you after him. That's nice. And he's dead. How'd he die? Ok. Oh, uh... I'm supposed to do something tomorrow after work with this girl. Want to go? Maybe we can talk about that tomorrow. Ok. Ok. Ok. Is there an easier way down from here than how I... I nailed boards. Oh, you got boards there. Ok, I'll...I'll use the boards. Thanks. Here goes. See you later. So what you got waiting for you in California? I don't...I don't mean to pry or nothing. My brother's stationed there. Army? Marine corps. That must be something else. Yeah. Older brother? Yeah. He raised me. What about your parents? Car accident when I was 3. I'm sorry to hear that. I don't even remember 'em. Anyhow, Harry... he's a father, brother... Best friend all rolled into one. How long has it been since you seen him? Long time. Oh... That's it. You going out with Kitty tonight? Yeah, and flyboy. What? Got ourselves a 3-way date. Ho...hey, hold on. Fill me in here. What the hell do you want to know, Earl? I'm trying to get some water here. Well, when the hell... When the hell did you and flyboy get so friendly? I ain't never heard him talk. Nobody has. Well, he talks, all right. Just like me and you. Well... So where'd you learn how to cook so good? I didn't mean to startle... Startle you like that. Where'd you learn how to cook so good? Um. I was, uh... I cooked... I learned, um, in Topeka. In the hospital? Y-Yes. How long were you in there? Um, in...I was in, um... Ah, when...I was in when I was 13. When you were 13? When I was thir... You were in the hospital when you were 13 years old? Yes. And you are 21 now? 21...now. Yes. Well, what the hell were you doing in there for that long? Listen, do me a favor. From now on, when I ask you a stupid question, just tell me to shut up. All right? All right. Ok. All right. All right. That's good. All right. Ok. So, um... Then, you know, if Jim over here doesn't mind at all... We have a date that we should probably get ready for... For this evening. A date. Mm-hmm. We sh... Um...All right. Ok? Ok. All right, so... So, we'll go get ready for the date, me and you. Ok. Hey, flyboy, you grab my smokes? They should be in that knapsack there. Flyboy? You still there, partner? Could I bother you for a match? Thank you. Seem a little locker- room shy, fly. Back in high school... I knew a guy that was a little locker-room shy. He'd never take a shower with the rest of us. He'd wait for the rest of us to, you know, go in the shower, and he'd just kind of sit there, pretending like he was rearranging his locker or something. Then, when all of us were leaving, he'd undress just quick as a jackrabbit and show up to the shower with a towel wrapped around his waist tight as a noose. Lot of guys thought he was queer or something, but turned out he was just a virgin. Now, I suspect that you're the latter of the variety. That's nothing to be ashamed of, fly. You know my brother? He used to say, "all it takes is just one girl." Seems to me like all you need, fly, is a little shot of confidence. And there's nothing better for a guy's confidence than a good roll in the sack. 'Course, there's a few tricks of the trade that you...That you gotta learn first. Now, the first rule is if a girl says "no" to you, just oblige her right away. Most times she'll be saying "yes" right before you get your jeans back on. Now, if she says "yes" to you right off the bat, that calls for a different strategy. No matter how bad you want her, you got to hold back. You getting all this down, fly? Flyboy? May I have a drag? Thank you very much. Are you always this charming afterwards? Nope. What's the matter? Nothing. What are you thinking about? That Joel's car? Yep. She obviously goes for the, ah, sober and refined type. Her type is anything with 2 legs and a zipper in the middle. I'll see you tomorrow, ok? Hey. Let's go to Hayes tomorrow night. They have a drive-in. You mind if I bring a friend? Who might that be? Just somebody I want you to meet. Clay, there's nobody in sealy I haven't met already. Well, this person doesn't get out all that much. Clay, who are you talking about? 'Night. Bye. Good evening. Hi. Do you want something? A match. Keep 'em. Thank you. Do you have any glasses here? No. Well, we'll have to do something about that. Oh, no, thanks. I appreciate it, but I was actually just getting ready to go to bed here. Impossible. It's 120-something degrees. So, please... Do be polite and take me up on my hospitality. Hospitality. You are something. Don't get me wrong... I've had better. But I've certainly had worse. Hmm! You are something. However, you're not setting the parameters of this relationship. I don't know what you're talking about. You didn't come all the way out here to the middle of nowhere just for the scenery. Sanctuary's not easy to come by in life, Mr. Hewitt. Good night. How was your 3-way date? Flyboy kind of got cold feet, but, ah... I wouldn't push too hard if I was you. H-Hey, pal! Stood me up last night. You out drinking again? That's all right. I think I can overlook it this time. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, Earl, this here is flyboy. All right, I'll see you at dinner then. Here you go. Thanks, fly. Well, I can see you're determined. One thing, though... People here, they like things to stay the same, mostly. As bad as it may seem, the way things are around here's the way she wants them. You'll have a hell of a battle on your hands if you try and change them. There you go, buddy. One trip is always better than 2. Get him! You got him! C'mon, let him go! That's enough! Let go of me, goddamn it! Son of a bitch! There! You see how your new hand's working out? Mr. Carter, you will take the rest of the afternoon off. What? Wh...He's the one who started it! Don't come back till Monday morning. The rest of you... Get back to work. Ok...we'll get the finishing touches here, and then we're all set. Going faster than a roller coaster Just keep your head up just a little bit more, fly. That's perfect. Thank you. Ok... Everyday, it's a-gettin' faster everyone said, "go ahead and ask her" Perfect. Troy Donahue, I believe. ...will surely come my way a-hey, a-hey hey Looks good. Everyday seems a little longer every way, loves a little stronger You ever been to a drive-in before, fly? You...um... You have, um... You have a... A whistle? You've, uh... You've been investigating. You have a gold... Gold, uh... On a chain. A-hey, a-hey hey you mean this? I got this for, uh... Courage in the line of duty. See, some kid was messing around at the pool. I was a lifeguard before. Everyday seems a little longer every way, love's a little stronger Now, just between me and you here, ok? Ok. Ok. ...true love from me everyday I wasn't even really paying attention. See, I was busy talking to some girl, and all of a sudden she screams, right? So I look, and I see some kid lying at the bottom of the pool. So I dove in and brought him up. Saved his life, I guess. ...Just started shaving... Thanks. ...do it the right way. Starting tomorrow morning, barely, really. Try the new "silver safety razor and blade." Do you like the movie? He's so shy. She see him leave with you? I don't care if she did. Maybe he cares. Geronimo Want something to drink? We thought they could raise some scratch for us... It's good. It's bourbon. Sure. You don't want me to drink alone, do you? Bum Doo Dee Wah Wah bum Doo Dee Wah Wah bum Doo Dee Wah Wah, bum Doo Dee Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah oh, he's my guy boom Wah Wah Wah there's no one sweeter boom Wah Wah Wah oh, he's my guy boom Wah Wah Wah You oughta meet him well flyboy, I think we're going to be very good friends. I love him so, he makes me sigh my guy, my guy now, there was Ja-ack, and there was Ji-Im and Louie was really swe-ell Larry was smart, and Eddie was sharp but none of them gave me a thrill like my guy You know, Kitty, man, she's crazy about you. You know, I think she finally met a guy that could drink her under the table. That's it, fly. You should laugh. You're almost a grown man, fly. You're entitled to a lot more. A lot more. Well, um... I'm not a grown man. Ok, now look. See, a man becomes a man when he realizes that he's one. You know, when he decides that he's one. And that's, you know, no matter what anybody else says. You see, uh... Well, uh... You know, um, we all end up making that decision... At some point. One way or the other. Sometimes, even... Even by accident. The thing about it is, fly, once you open that door, it, uh... It shuts behind you. There's no going back through. Sound sort of sad, don't they? No. They're...They're... I think they're...Happy. Why do you say that? Well, the locusts, um... They're cicadas, really... They live underground for years and years. And...and sometimes... More years. And then something... Something tells them that... And it's a scientific mystery... But something tells them to... To come out, and so they...They do. But just for a little... A little while. Then what do they do? Well, then...Then they don't live very long above ground. They only...They only live for one summer, so, um, they sing because they're happy to be above ground, even if it's just for a little while. Did your father teach you that? Mm-hmm. He said, "happy are the locusts' lives, "for they have voiceless wives." She...she didn't like that very much. "Happy are the locusts' lives, for..." Um..."for they have voiceless wives." So then only the males sing? Hmm. Hmm. And that...That...That's how sometimes the wasps get 'em. The wasps? Want a smoke? Mm-hmm. Go ahead. No. When a man lights a cigarette, he always cups his hands like this, like it's windy out. Dream, dream, dream mm-hmm. When I want you now, when a man lights a girl's cigarette... When I want you and all your charms She always touches his hand like this. All I have to do every time. Is dre-e-eam dream, dream, dream when I feel blue in the night So...what happens when a girl lights a girl's cigarette? Whenever I want you all I have to do is dre-e-e-eam I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine anytime, night or day only trouble is gee whiz! I'm dreamin' my life away I need you so, that I could die I love you so, and that is why whenever I want you all I have to do is dre-e-e-am dream, dream, dream dre-e-e-am I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine anytime, night or day only trouble is gee whiz! I'm dreamin' my life away I need you so, that I could die I love you so, and that is why whenever I want you all I have to do is dre-e-e-am dream, dream, dream dre-e-e-am dream, dream, dream dre-e-e-am dream, dream, dream She almost took a bite right out of her highball. Days are getting shorter already. Flyboy. I'm going to be leaving soon. There's something I want you to do for me. I want you to keep it up. Don't let her take control of you. Clay. Ok? Ok. You know, I've been thinking. How do you feel about working on the feedlot? Look, I'll show you the ropes tomorrow. And then Earl and...Cameron, they can help you out after I leave. Ahem. I wanted to... I wanted to... Tell you... You... I want to go to work in the feedlot. Um, I have to... I have to learn the ropes. Um, I’m...I'm the man of the... Man of the...House, and...And... And I'll be...I'll be running the feedlot someday. Is there anything else? Then you tell Mr. Hewitt I enjoyed his little speech. You'll work in the kitchen as always. Uh, did you have something of your own you wanted to say? "Happy are the locusts' lives..." I-I'm going to work in the feedlot tomorrow. Storm's coming. Hey...how about coming with me to Kitty's? Her parents left today for Colorado or something. Have the house to ourselves. No, thank you. All right then. Try and get some sleep. Got a big day tomorrow. Good night, partner. Good night. So now we're gonna skip the sex part and go straight to the brooding? I'm not brooding. I'm smoking. Well, look. I've discovered I can smoke and have a conversation all at the same time. That's good. You converse all you want. It's Clay Hewitt. I'm...ever since that guy got into town, he's... And if we get married... Um... I can buy you a television. And we...And...And then... and we can watch it. I want to go with you. I have my truck. I can drive. I'm serious, Clay. It's coming on the end of the summer, and you're gonna be leaving. No. Why not? I'm in trouble, Kitty. Back in k.C., I, um... I thought you were from St. Joe. There was this girl... And I was a lifeguard... She was 16 years old, and I was a lifeguard at the club. They would have gotten me on rape, so I just, uh... But you didn't? So she wanted to? It was late, and I was off duty, and... We were in the pool together. She slipped, and her head went into the wall... I don't understand. Did she tell somebody? She's dead. You can't go with me, Kitty. Someday he's gonna run this place. Going to learn the ropes. Joel? Yes, ma'am? Get some rope. You don't have a brother in California, do you? Give me a few days to get some money together. You're getting out of here. And if you like bulls, I h...I have...I have one. What are you doing? Since you're gonna be running this place someday, you need to learn how things are done. This is your first lesson. Get him up. Uh! Move him. Tonight, we learn a technique which is invaluable to this operation how to turn a bull into a steer. No! No! No! No! No! Step one, antibiotics. No! Step 2, the horns. Go on! No! Skip it! Conveniently, he's been branded, so we'll go right to step 4. Do it! God! Give it to me. No! Don't! No! Hold his head. Ah! No! No! No! No! No! Now, you watch this, 'cause I'm only gonna show you once. You killed him, too. You know that, don't you? Bull this old, his heart couldn't take it. Where is she? She left before we got here. Note said she'd be gone on business till Friday. Business? Getting ready for auction, I guess. Business or not, she wasn't gonna be here when we found this. Flyboy. Fly... Flyboy, listen to me. You can't let her do this to you. She wants you to be the same... To be afraid... But you can't let her. But I killed him. No. She killed him. Goddamn it, flyboy, open your eyes for a second. I'm sorry, flyboy, but I'm angry here. Are you? See, I know what she did to your father, her and that ranch hand. Flyboy, look at me here. Look at me. Look at me. She's played her final card. She's got nothing left to hurt you with now. Ok? You gotta show her that you're still standing. If you give up now, then Jim will have died for nothing, and then she'll have won. Do you remember that decision that we talked about? You made it. And you can't go back. You have to get out of here. I can't leave him like this. And getting him a girl is gonna help? Yeah, it will help. Just try and understand. It changes a man. It makes a man. You, of all people, should know better. What are you talking about? I'm talking about Kansas City. Jesus Christ... Kitty, look at me. Can't you see what this is gonna do? This is gonna break the goddamned spell she has him under. You are gonna breeze out of here, and he is gonna be left to deal with her. Then what? You're gonna knock her dead. You look great. All right, fly, that's it. That's your last. You're gonna pass out halfway through dinner. No more here. That's it. I...i can't. Can y...Um, can you tell her I’m...I'm sorry? And deprive her of the best date of her entire life? Hmm? Flyboy, I'm gonna have to peel her off the ceiling when she gets one look at you. Ok, listen. I know it seems hard the first time. But after that, girls all over this county are gonna be beating a path to that tree house of yours. Now, you look great. How do I look? How's my tie? Is it straight? It's good? I...i... I don't... I don't know. Fly, turn around here. Courage. How are you? Ellen, this is, uh, flyboy. Flyboy, this is Ellen. Hi, flyboy. I met you at the tastee-freez. Hello. Do you think I look like Brenda Lee? I mean, everybody... Everybody says so. I don't think so. What do you think? Love hurts, love scars love wounds and Mars You know, I think you look a little like Montgomery clift. Don't worry, that's good. He's dreamy. Though, not...Not... Not that much since the accident. Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain love hurts love hurts I'm young, I know but even so I know a thing or 2 I've learned from you flyboy's gonna show me the house. Really learned a lot love is like a stove, burns you when it's hot love hurts Love hurts Hmm... Well, well. That was fast. Well, good for him. Yeah, good for him. So... When are you gonna be leaving us? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah. Tomorrow. She ain't even gonna be back till Friday. When...Ah... How are you gonna get paid? Well, I talked to my, ah... I talked to my brother this morning, and, ah... You know, he asked me what the hell was holding me up down here. And when I told him it was money, he just, you know... Sent it to me just like that. Kitty and I, uh, went and picked it up this morning, actually. Well... We're gonna miss you. Come visit. I always wanted to see the ocean. It's out there, Earl. Send me a postcard. Somebody take me home right now. What happened? I don't...I don't know. Father, father, father, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, father. What happened, fly? She said...She said... Who said? We have to give dad... We have to give dad a present. We have to give dad a present. It's our anni... it's our anni... it's our anniversary. Whose anniversary? You have to come... You have to come... But you have to... you have to come in the bedroom. You have to come in the bedroom. And you...And you...And you take your...You take your clothes off, young man. You take your... and she took...And she took her clothes off and said, "get under the covers" and "get under the covers." And he...And he came...He came in. And she said... "Happy..." "Happy anniversary." And he was hanging in the tree. I killed him. I killed him. Father, I'm s...I'm sorry. I'm s...I'm sorry. What happened? I'm taking him with me. Grab some food for the bus. You all packed? Yes. Good. This is yours now. No. I didn't sh-show courage. Flyboy... I want to apologize to you. No. No. No. I c... I couldn't do anything... Until... You're... You're my friend. Time to go? No, not yet. Someone outside wants to say good-bye to you. See you later. Hi, flyboy. Hello. There's fried chicken... And potato salad and beans... And, um, some cake left over from last night... And oranges with marshmallows. Let's have a beer. Good evening. Are you leaving us, Mr. Hewitt? I asked you a question. Yes...I'm going. That's not your suitcase. Running late? No. That's good. You'll have time for a drink. No, actually, I don't have time for a drink. I strongly suggest you take me up on my offer. You were going to leave without your pay? I must say that's quite generous of you. And my son... you were planning on taking him with you? That's right. I see. And where is he now? Waiting for me. How elaborate. I don't believe you mentioned where it was you were taking my son. Well, you see, Mrs. Potts, it's who I'm taking him from that really matters, isn't it? Yes, of course. "Someday my prince will come." Bitch. You never told me you were a lifeguard, Mr. Hewitt. I heard the most terrible story while on business in Kansas City. You'll have that drink now, won't you? Woop! What's the matter? Clay said that when... when a man lights a girl's cigarette, she touches your hand. Ha ha ha. I'm not laughing at you. Ok. It's just that some of Clay's theories about girls have a few holes in them. Cigarette? My, you're attractive when you're scared. You should be scared. You blundered your way into a situation that's infinitely messier than the little mess you left behind. Only this mess comes in the rather grotesque form of a family. Take off your shirt. You are in no position to play by anybody's rules but mine. So take it off. The essence of virility. I'm beside myself. Now drink. I said drink. That's my big boy. Now, as I was saying, you have stumbled into a messy, messy situation... A family situation. Frankly, my young Adonis, you've walked right into a family trap. Family trapped, I should say. The pants. I'm going to miss you, flyboy. Why don't... Y-You could come. Clay doesn't think it's a very good idea. You'll...you'll miss him, too? Mm-hmm. You love him. Did you know my mother died giving birth to me? The men of the house never forgave me for that. Am I supposed to feel sorry for you? He has no more right to escape than I do. He will live here, and he will die here with me. And in the interim, we'll make sacrifices and compromises to endure otherwise. End up like Mr. Potts? Mr. Potts' facility for compromise failed him. He was a weak man. I heard he was a good man. Oh, yes, Mr. Potts was a good man. A veritable Saint. Martyr...might be a better word. I know the truth. I know what happened that night. The truth. That's right. How pitiful... Fumbling around in the dark, drawing your simple-minded conclusions. You know the truth, do you? In your overzealous haste to pass judgment, a few facts eluded your brilliant powers of deduction, so let me enlighten you a little. After all, you've ingratiated yourself so willfully that you're practically a member of the family, and as a member, you're both privy to itS secret code... And subject to itS rather unique mores. Mr. Potts had no spine whatsoever. As you so aptly stated, he was a good man. And in his infinite goodness, he took pity on a 19-year-old girl who was pregnant... Who was pregnant and thus had to give up... All hopes of escaping her life, but... He offered to marry her, though he was not responsible for... Her maternal condition. God knows he wasn't responsible. He wasn't capable. And for the next 13 years, he beat her with tolerance and shamed her with impotence... No matter what she did to rebuke him. But...such is the price of appearances. And he raised my son as his own. And who was his father? You really don't understand, do you, little boy? Then who the hell was his father? To sum up... I was responsible for my mother's untimely death. My father thought it only fair that I assume her responsibilities. Now that we've played the final round of true confessions, this is your pay in full, in cash. You may take it and leave freely... Without my son. Keep it. I'm leaving with flyboy. Mr. Hewitt... Since your arrival here, you have foolishly refused to accept that I am in control. If you choose to leave with my son, then you'll have to play the game my way. Play the game your way? That's right. God damn you, bitch! Aren't you straying from your pattern? Or are you skipping the rape this time? I'm leaving now... With your son. As you wish. Unfortunately, yours will be a return trip to Kansas City. Ever seen pictures of the electric chair? Chilling. Hello. Yes, could you connect me with the sheriff's department? Yes, I'll wait. I'd like to report... Then shall we go upstairs? When I awake don't look at your feet. Look at me. As usual and then if you really like somebody... I can't find a way to let this crazy heart of mine forget I pretend you're still beside me as usual each evening I take a walk as usual I make believe that we still talk as usual people always stop and stare I guess they just don't see you there don't they know you'll always... Well, you better get going. Ok. Tell Clay I'll be there in a minute to take you to the station. Flyboy. Thank you for a wonderful date. It was the best one I ever had. ...the tears began to fill my eyes 'cause I know I’m only fooling myself as usual Happy anniversary, flyboy. Flyboy. All things come to an end, Mr. Hewitt. Thank you for your cooperation. Flyboy! Flyboy! Flyboy! Flyboy! Fly... Flyboy! We got to leave still. 8:00. 8:00, the bus leaves, so... Shh...shh... It's ok. It's ok. Shh. You're my friend. Shh... What the hell? Oh. Oh, my god. Clay, don't! Clay! Clay! Clay! Clay, don't! Please, help me. I'm going with you. Where? Does it matter? Love hurts love scars love wounds and Mars any heart not tough nor strong enough to take a lot of pain take a lot of pain love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain love hurts love hurts I'm young I know but even so I know a thing or 2 I've learned from you I've really learned a lot really learned a lot love is like a stove burns you when it's hot love hurts love hurts some fools rave of happiness blissfulness togetherness some fools fool themselves, I guess but they're not fooling me I know it isn't true know it isn't true love is just a lie made to make you blue love hurts love hurts love hurts
