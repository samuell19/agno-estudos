Highland park, known as the hubcap of the mighty industrial wheel that is Detroit, celebrates its fabled past, birthplace of the production line, the new idea that hard work an ingenuity have created the mightiest economic engine in human history, one capable of providing nearly everyone the benefits of a well-paying job. From farmland to cradle of the American dream in just half a century. On the move as always, this town of tomorrow looks forward as it pauses to look back. Where the statue of Liberty once welcomed those in search of hope, highland park's main library now stands as the beacon of civic pride to millions in search of opportunity. Highland park civic leaders have left nothing to chance... ♪ ♪ Incumbent mayor Shirley paine still leads the polls, despite her announcement of biding new austerity measures. The further cuts in funding for firefighters, nursing staff, and school programs highlight highland park's ever-deepening financial crisis and raise more questions about spending priorities as well as the mayor's award of expensive contracts to close associates. When asked why she allocates millions to vanity projects like the new stadium while failing to maintain our crumbling infrastructure, the colorful mayor scoffed at hints of misconduct, stating that monumental problems facing the city demand leadership with shiny, big ideas that get people's attention, not unsexy projects like storm drain maintenance. She reiterated her campaign promise to create jobs by fostering large-scale developments, like construction of a fashion outlet mall on the site where the city's main library now stands. She defended plans to demolish vacant structures to eliminate the cost of policing the sparsely populated... Come on, kids. Let's all gather round. Let's go! Let's go, men. Listen up. Take a knee. - Lloyd, with waterford, that's 1,261 plants shut since they closed the main library. - I guess I should be more realistic. - Well, you've only been out of school a little while.

This week's drawing is the second-biggest jackpot in state history. The lottery provides support for schools... - Oh, yeah. Some support. We alone spend thousands. They just keep cutting programs, funding. - Like, thousands of dollars? - Yeah, Jessie, dollars. 12 tickets a week for over a decade. That's over $6,000. Good luck, everyone. Your winning numbers are... 49. - Oh... - Whoo! - That's what I'm talkin' about. Next is 38. Next, we have 44. And that's followed by 48. And now, tonight's gold mega ball is... 13. - Fuck. If no one wins this one... - And I guess I didn't miss anything. - Nope. - Next week's jackpot will be a record of over $250 million. Remember, the future's in your hands. Tonight, we're reporting on mayor Shirley paine's controversial plan to demolish the historic main library, once the heart of highland park's civic core. She had this to say about plans for a new fashion center mall to replace the 90-year-old Mozart structure. - Isn't that wonderful? The mayor says she'll utilize a $150,000 federal Grant, originally earmarked to study the library's restoration, to instead demo the... - Is, um... Anybody else questioning these numbers we've been playing for over ten freakin' years? Ed, I understand. You know, your old man won that sweepstakes with the 12 lucky tickets. - One for each apostle. - You don't even believe in religion. - I believe in fate. - So we were fated to play 6,000 lotto tickets and not win a dime. - Starting to sound like you're blaming me for something. - I'm not blaming you, i... but... Let's look at this. Does anyone consider these might be our unlucky numbers? I mean, 12 and 13. Well, those are for your anniversary, right, Jess? - Yeah. Why? - How long you been divorced? - Hey, I happen to like my birthday. - I got no problem with your birthday, Toni. Ed's birthday... - It wasn't my fault I was born the same day as Hitler. Oh. - No, it wasn't. It was fate, right? I mean, all I'm saying is that, uh, guys, none of US have any money to waste anymore. I know it's just a couple of bucks a week, but with the money we've spent so far, we could have bought some books. We could have, I don't know, planted a garden. We could be sending a better message to our students than, "grow up and get together once a week and pray for a miracle." - Nah, come on, Lloyd. Now, what is not what we're doing here. - I'm just here for the beer. - Here, hal. Here you go.

It's fun. - Hey, who told you you could leak our win? - We need national exposure. You're not gonna get anywhere pimping of principal-to-principal, but rags-to-riches gets them every time. I got one chance to put this place on the map, and nothing's gonna get in my way. We gotta get our share of the bailout billions, navigate through all the red tape and your idiotic altruism, and luck's our in. - Hey. The shiny people. - Hey. - Well, as an important member of our community now, I thought it was time I brought you into the inner circle. I believe you know almost everyone. - Why is it I feel like an open vein at a vampire convention? So... - Pleasantries aside. I really wanted you to meet one of our most successful alums. - Well, I never really graduated. - Oh. - Is that Ali? - Your favorite history student. - Um...welcome back. You got expelled, didn't you? - Well, after your history class ended my troubled relationship with authority, I started... - all right, you hacked in and changed your grade in the school's computer. - Well, I didn't think it was fair. - Ali wants to build a factory here. - I started my own company, making turbines for alternative energy systems. After our little misunderstanding. And the towers went down, my dad was laid off, moved to California. Like a modern-day Tom joad from the grapes of wrath. You called it. Highland park's the capital of the rust bowl. The simple fact is, we gave up on people's jobs. They want to put their hands to work and build things they'd be proud of. See, I was paying attention in your class. I want to take over the old American bearing plant where our dads worked. With my people, the hope's in your own hands. - What an opportunity...what are the big plans for your future? - Uh, yeah, well, I'd like to create an urban farm co-op in highland park. - What about a Ferrari or a yacht or your own island? - Mr. Howard's being very modest. We had a fantastic meeting. He's decided to expand his local cleanup project, and to jump-start it, he's made the miraculous offer to donate $1 million of his winnings. - That's a lot of money. - So he's gonna write a check? - Uh...that's wrong. - The mayor's got that a little bit wrong. Um, I've actually decided to... Give... $5 million... Principle Howard... - To grassroots programs. We're gonna clean up some parks, uh, restore the old library, some after-school activities, uh, restore some pri... we're gonna restore some pride around here. - This is great for the kids. What about... - and I am honored that the mayor has decided to match these funds in order to hire back some teachers and rebuild the library. - Why the change of heart? Thank you, mayor. - Mayor, where's the money coming from? - All right, great. Thank you. Excuse me. - Has your brother now bid on the library restoration? - Yes, it's a very inspired meeting we had in there. Now, they say that money can't buy everything. But it can. That's always confused me. Because that's what money does, it buys things. You know? - So... No goodfellasmoments, huh? - What was I gonna do? I'm not gonna let her push me around anymore. - And are you really gonna give all your money away just because Shirley beat out your wife for homecoming queen? - That is not what I did, I... Look, this is a good thing. It's worthwhile. - I think we should at least have the money in hand before we spend any more of it. - You know, would you leave him alone? You gotta spend your money on what makes you happy. All right, brah. Like when I bought that ring for char. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? - Who's char? - I thought you were with Toni! - Oh, no, no, no, man. That would have never worked out. - 'Cause she's smarter than you? Frankly...yes. - But I want to provide for somebody. You know what I'm saying? You know, have them adore me. - Yeah. - Love me. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Sounds like you want a pet. - You know, char needs me. Okay? I can get her things, things that she can't get herself. You know, Toni, on the other hand, you know, she can get everything that I can get for her. So I don't think...you know, why would she need me? Okay? I just don't see it. - I don't know, companionship? - Ooh, that's a good one. Hey, how about love, huh? - If he can spend half of his money on an ancient grudge, then I can spend some of my money on a young, beautiful, sexy... - congratulations. - Hey! - No, no. No, thank you. Thank you, yeah. He's already taken twice. - Okay. - Thanks very much. Thanks very much. Move along. So, uh, what did Sylvia say when you told her you were gonna give away your money? - Pretty sure it won't be good. - You didn't tell her? - Man, come on! Look, you know what happens to people who win the lottery. They either end up broke or in prison. - We're inviting everybody to help stop this city's slide into oblivion. And we're starting here at the city's heart. Uh...the old library. And you at home, you can start in your own front yards. Uh, paint out some graffiti. Mow down some weeds. - Well, highland park turned out in force today. Not to volunteer, unfortunately, but to celebrate in a big way. - There's zero chance that anyone is gonna raise a finger to save this place. Why didn't you talk to me before you made that kind of a decision? - I'm sorry, i... I'm sorry. It... I... Look, this is a chance for me to do something that I've always wanted to do. Besides, we're...we got plenty of money left over. I mean, we get, uh, you know, enough to send the kids to a good school. We're gonna buy a big, new house. - Hmm! - We're gonna get some appliances. Tell you what. Tomorrow... I'm gonna buy a mattress. A big one. With sheets. And pillows. - Ohh. - Yeah. Hmm? - You're just talkin' dirty now. - Mm. Refrigerator. - Refrigerator. - Mm-hmm.

It's the damn real estate agents. - How much do you need? - 150,000. - Holy shit! - That's pocket change to you. - Okay, I'll see what I can do. You haven't even asked about dad yet. - Guess I was stressed about the house. - He keeps forgetting things. I mean, even this lottery thing. I tell him about it, he gets all excited, and the next day, he doesn't remember it at all. Guess the upside is dad gets to win the lottery every day. - Did I grow a target on my forehead overnight? Five lawsuits. Never been sued in my life. This janitor, he moves to Ohio, and he's suing me for keeping him out of the pool. - Didn't you fire him? - Yeah, I fired everybody. What, are they all gonna sue me now? How come none of you guys are getting sued? - 'Cause you're the one on TV. - We didn't fire anybody. - That's the problem with this country. Everybody just wants to blame everybody else. - Isn't it getting kind of late? - Ed probably got tired and pulled off to stay the night somewhere. - Well, wouldn't he have called? - 30 years, he's only called me twice 'cause he's been late. Once to bail him out. You're done. - Wow. That kind of felt like last call. Ed, I don't get what's happening with you. What the hell was that? - It's been circling out there for a while now. - What has? - I'm not sure. - Look... We're supposed to be home by now. - You remember when you were a kid, Bert? Remember the beginning of summer? The sea of time before you, filled with endless possibilities, and the summer came to an end, and you... You started feeling let down, like... Like all those possibilities weren't quite fulfilled. That happened until you realized one day... That was your life spread out in front of you. The day that I retired... Was fired... It felt like life... It felt like life was running out of summers. And... Lottery tickets are a lot like summers. Those blank tickets hold all that possibility. Until you fill them up with your numbers. Then you have just one chance. And then it's gone. - Ed... What exactly's happened? - You know what? - What? - Run. - What if he's dead? Oh, don't tell me it hasn't crossed your mind. - He's not dead. - He hasn't been seen or heard from in days. Maybe Bert murdered him, or... He fled to Canada with the ticket, or he lost it. - Rory, you're getting paranoid. - Yeah, well, a fella in Collins stole a million bucks from some guys in a pool in '93. - And how do you have that on the tip of your tongue? - Gobbers told me. - All right. Wanna know my theory? Ed's got a second wife. And she found out, and she killed him for our ticket. - Oh, great. - Plans to run off to Argentina. - I know what y'all talking about 'cause I'm a little worried about him too. His health hasn't been that great. But he's fine, okay? So stop your worrying. - May, do you want me to stay here and keep you company? - No, I'll be fine. I'll call you all as soon as he gets back. Tomorrow is gonna be a big day. Go home and get some rest. - Okay. - Okay? - Thank you, may. - Paranoia aside, if he's not here by noon, I'm up there to find him. - Better believe it. - Ed? Ohh! Baby, thank god. Oh, what happened? We were so worried about you. - I'm...I'm fine. I ju...i just, uh, took some time to do a little soul searching. So you know! - Hey, may, may, may... - What? - Um, we've been together over 36 years. - Uh-huh. - And in that time, I've done some stupid things. - They're all forgiven, baby. None of that matters anymore. - May, I-I need... I need for you to listen because i... I practiced what I had to say 100 times in my head, and I don't want to mess it up. - Okay. - You might murder me. - Oh! Okay, I'm all ears. - You know I'm just like anyone. You know, you're gonna see signs and find meaning in little things, like, uh, my lucky number in a license plate... - Mm-hmm. - You know, and something like that. - See, after all these years, baby, nobody thinks you're crazy anymore. Come on, tell me about your vision! - Th-the...it just... It ended up just being food poisoning. - That's nonsense, ed. We won! We won, baby! The only thing we have to worry about is... Where we gonna spend our retirement, and what hotel we gonna stay in... In Paris! - There's not going to be a hotel, may. No retirement. No Paris. - Of course there is, baby. Of course. - No, no, I didn't buy the tickets, may. I bought some other silly ticket with the numbers from this damn fortune cookie. Uh...may... You all right? People just want to believe there's gotta be something more. If not, then what's the difference? All those visions, astrologers, superstitions...no. "What if that beggar was god" kind of stuff. Ah, makes you crazy sometimes. - Ed, I know you're trying to... Put some structure on this, but... That beggar, you know, sometimes is just a beggar. A cigar sometimes just a cigar, ed. What we gonna do? This is all on US. - We're no worse off than before. I mean, things weren't that bad, were they? Now, disappointing, yeah. But it's not like we told 'em we're dying.
