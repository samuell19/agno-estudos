Don't Tell Me The Boy Was Mad - I think history's most important moments do not take place on battlefields, in palaces or parliaments... But in kitchens, bedrooms and nurseries. - That's maybe why wars, once they start, never end. They continue in another form. Sadly, I think you're right. Don't believe them, honey. There'll be no more war! Berlin, 15 March 1921 Adolf Hitler I am Armenian! He's a Turk! He's a murderer! At Charlottenburg police station, you stated you are Soghomon Tehlirian, born on 2nd April 1897 in Pakaridj, Turkey, you're an Armenian citizen, a mechanics student, arrived in Berlin in early December. That is correct, Mr President. Did you know the victim personally? No, Mr President. But I know he ordered the massacre of my family, my mother, my father, my sister my whole people. When did you decide to murder Talaat Pasha? When my mother asked me to. Your mother? Two weeks ago, I had a nightmare. I saw my mother's body. Her body rose up and came close to me and said: "Talaat Pasha is in Berlin "and you don't care! "You're no longer my son!" When I woke up, I decided to kill him. So you admit it was a premeditated act? No. I don't feel guilty. I killed a man but I'm not a murderer! I want the session adjourned! Granted. We'll resume in one hour. Talaat Pasha fell down. The postmortem says the victim's brain burst open with such force that death was immediate. Mr Tehlirian, what did you feel at that moment? I felt satisfaction in my heart, Mr President. And today? Today, I'm still pleased with what I did. But you know that no one may dispense justice, even if they've suffered outrage. When my mother ordered me to kill Talaat Pasha, my soul was so disturbed that... I no longer knew if I had the right to kill. Do Armenians usually seek bloody revenge? - No. - Our laws forbid us to kill for revenge. Death to the Turks! Police, evacuate the room! Carry on and you're doomed! Is that what you want? To be condemned to death? Freedom for Armenia! "The Armenian people's martyrdom "was not known in Germany till the war ended!" Next sentence: "In the name of its alliance with Turkey, "our country has become a partner to appalling butchery." End. This trial is the trial of state policy! Talk later. Mr Tehlirian, I must warn you that any demonstration will be blamed on you. The trial must take place in an atmosphere of calm! I agree with you, Mr President. You lived with your family in Erzingian. How many Armenians were there then? About 20,000. All Christians. How many Kurds and Turks? About 30,000. One morning, the Armenians were ordered to evacuate the town. Yes, the order came from Constantinople. It was said to come from Talaat Pasha, then the interior minister. That's what they said. It's true. Let's get to the facts. After the evacuation order, what happened? The Armenian people were dumped like cattle outside the town. We were told that our valuable possessions could be entrusted to the authorities. Several convoys were formed. My parents had a cart pulled by a donkey. Who escorted the convoy? The police. After a fashion... What do you mean? The Turks had brought Kurdish bandits out of jail and given them police uniforms! They were the worst! But the Kurds weren't all wild animals! Were there soldiers from the regular army? Yes. On both sides of the road. No one could escape. A boy I knew well tried to escape. He was caught and beaten to death. And then? When our convoy set off, the police took our money. My mother protested. A policeman grabbed my sister by the hand and went off with her. My mother was yelling. She shouted: "May I go blind!" At that moment, there was gunfire at the front of the convoy. Some Armenians tried to defend themselves. The soldiers were just waiting for this to give the order for the massacre, and the rabble got involved. What rabble? The Turks of Erzingian. My little brother had his skull split open with an axe. My mother was killed soon after. By a bullet, though... I'm not sure. Everywhere, there was screaming. And your father? He was further ahead. I never saw him again. And you? I was hit on the head and I fell down. They thought I was dead. How long did I stay there? I don't know. Maybe two days... Two days? I don't know. When I woke up, there were bodies all around. My brother was lying on top of me. The whole convoy had been massacred. I was wounded in the head and the leg. But I started walking. I went to a mountain village. An old woman took me in and cared for me. An Armenian woman? No. A Kurdish family. Good people, who advised me to go to Persia. They gave me traditional Kurdish clothes so I wouldn't be stopped. Mr President, I want to remind you that one and a half million Armenians were deported like that. This was decided by the Young Turks' committee on the orders of Talaat Pasha and Enver Pasha, minister of war. Soghomon Tehlirian was among the 10% of deported Armenians who survived the massacres. Professor Johannes Lepsius, swear on the Bible that you will say only the truth. I swear. After conducting my research, I can attest that the Armenians expelled from Anatolia, Cilicia and Syria were gathered at the edge of the desert, in concentration camps, and were exterminated by systematic starvation and regular massacres. Soghomon Tehlirian's story is like many others. The facts are undeniable. How could a million people be wiped out so fast? Except by the most brutal and organized of methods. Doctor Lepsius, at the end of the war, the new Turkish rulers judged Talaat Pasha. The court martial insisted on the massacre of the Armenians. What was the verdict? Talaat Pasha and many other leaders were found guilty and condemned to death. The sentence was not carried out as they fled on the night of 3 November 1918 on a German torpedo boat. And then Germany refused to extradite Talaat Pasha, considering it impossible for him... to have provoked such barbaric acts! Mr Werthauer, we are not here to put Germany on trial, but to try a man accused of premeditated murder. Can you explain to the jury the reasons why the Turks came to take such extreme measures? The dream of setting up an Islamic Turkish empire, with no place for Christians, dates only from the beginning of the century. The Turks always feared an independent Armenia, which would have compromised the existence of Asiatic Turkey. Doctor Lepsius, thank you for your explanations. Mr President, for a better understanding of the massacres, may I pass round some photos which demonstrate their veracity? You may indeed, Professor. Hello? Can you hear? "In his summing up, "he asked the jury to respect the law, "apply the penalty for premeditated murder, "in other words death. "The defence lawyer responded at once. "He says all mankind is watching this trial, "that the sentence involves Germany, "that it will be examined "in 1,000 years, for odious crimes too long overlooked. "As the jury deliberates, it is difficult to tell "which way the judgement will go." Will the accused rise? President of the jury, speak. "On my honour, "I attest that, to the question: "'Is the accused, Soghomon Tehlirian, "'guilty of the premeditated murder of Talaat Pasha "'in Charlottenburg, on 15 March 1921?' "the decision of the jury is... "no." Kiss the hand that killed the monster! No one suspected that the death of Talaat Pasha had long been planned. We can be proud of our organization. This is a great day, friends! The whole world has acknowledged the extent of the massacres, the intention of extermination. will always be an example for Armenians. Now it's Said Halim who must be killed. We found him in Rome. And who do you think will do it? Arshavir Shirakian. Shirakian? He's a fanatic. He's jumping with impatience like a kid. True. But we can count on him. I'm scared these young men may go crazy and take pleasure in killing. - Pleasure? - Yes. I'm scared that repeated killings may make them forget the point of our struggle. The taste of blood inebriates. We are righters of wrongs! Not murderers! Then kill just one each! Two generations later, late 70s, Marseille. My dear little one Take revenge on those predators Take revenge on the Turks who massacred us Take revenge on those predators Take revenge on the criminal Turks Don't forget to spill the blood of Turks Don't forget your nation Don't forget you are Armenian Nounée! Look at the blood-soaked shirt your father was wearing Look at the blood-soaked shirt your father was wearing Come on, you. Come. Stop filling her head with this nonsense! Stop, Dad. That hurts. - You should be ashamed, Hovannès. - I am. Shame on you! Anouch, you must care for your mother. She smells of death. Your mother must go to a home. How can you say that? She wants to return to her old home, and you say that! - Her house burned in 1915. - The land doesn't burn. You're crazy to think she could go back, or that you and the kids could. Like the bandits claiming back our land. Why not call them "terrorists", like the Turks do? No, they're freedom fighters. If I was young I'd join. - You'd lay bombs. - Yes. You're crazy like your mother. We had land too, but I fought to live here, eat here, have a home here, send my kids to school here. And I still talk Armenian, eat Armenian, dance Armenian. My traditions keep my Armenia alive. - Oh? How do you say "Armenia is buried", in Armenian? Your forebears did like Tehlirian. They killed 50 of the 500 on their hit list. Then nothing. A trip to the cemetery on April 24, that's all. The 25th it's all forgotten till next year. Your generation gave up. You're digging your own graves. The Turks spoke to the prime minister. They think the inscription's an insult to Turkey from France. This is private property. I know, but you could let plants grow over it, so it wouldn't be seen. Are you serious? You're not helping me. You think the 1,500,000 Armenians living in Anatolia all went on vacation at the same moment? I know nothing of that. You should know, and know that you're here only because I went to war for you, for principles France dishonours. I didn't come for history lessons or moralizing. Why talk to him? Ask him if he collaborated with the Germans, like with the Turks. - Be quiet, Vahé. - No. We'll never be quiet. We won't allow people to sully our country. We are a great civilization. Our culture can rival that of any other nation. We did not commit a massacre. It was war. A country like yours mustn't let people defame us. You're a friendly country, aren't you? Of course, Ambassador. But we're also a country with private law. The monument in Marseille is in the private grounds of their church. We can do nothing. I warn you, if on April 24 there's a demonstration against Turkey, across France, we'll cut off diplomatic relations. And I, poor ambassador, will have to leave Paris, which I will greatly regret, for I love your city. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Brothers and sisters, on April 24, each year, we recall the bloody images of the massacre of our martyrs. This death was not just endured, it was the march of a people towards a calvary, in the name of their right to affirm their Armenian identity. By order of the authorities, the march to the Turkish consulate is banned, and no other street demonstration will be allowed. No posters, no banners. We ask you to leave the church in single file. We ask you to leave. Get out of here! This is a holy place. Get out. Then we'll leave. - Get out! - ...across the street. - This is our place! - Get out and we'll leave. Understood? Get out! Get out, they'll burn the church! It's starting again. Go away and we'll leave. Quietly. Get out. They'll burn the church! How can you bow your head, like our ancestors when they fled? What's changed since Tehlirian killed Talaat Pasha? Commemorations? You've wept over our dead, your lands, your ancient homeland. And now? All those tears were no use. No use at all. The silence has deepened over time. Today this silence is not enough for the Turkish fascists. They want to finish the job. They want to destroy our homes, our churches and cemeteries. They want to wipe out our memories. Like other fascists, they want to silence survivors, descendants. After killing the fathers, they want to kill the sons and grandsons. The Turkish soldiers are the heirs of Talaat Pasha. Let's be Tehlirian's heirs. Let's fight and finish his act of bringing justice. Justice for the Armenians. Long live Armenia! To arms... It's you. Seeing these seeds, I think maybe they come from my land in Erzurum, maybe my grandfather sowed them. I always say I'm Armenian. I even shouted it. I never betrayed anyone. All my life I've worked for you, for my family. I respect you for that. And you despise me for the rest. Nothing to say? Good night, Dad. I'll speak French so you can understand me well. If you become a chef like your father, don't make snacks for Armenians. Make a huge, delicious banquet and invite all the Turks in Marseille. And poison them. I promise I will. So I'll go to jail with pride. I'm not joking, Aram. If you become a ship's captain, put explosives in your ship and sail into the port of Istanbul. Soon I'll obey you, Grandma. In a few days. Don't tell anyone, OK? No. I won't. "We are pure revolutionaries, "solitary, "independent, "proud and haughty. "Nothing can besmirch our fight "or exhaust our determination." I want to go with you, Aram. To each his role. I'll be a hero. And you... you'll write about my story. Are you ready? I'm ready to die. Don't say that, Aram. I'm superstitious, and we've had enough martyrs. Are you Aram? Yes. You are Anahit. - Let's go. - OK. Hello. Do you speak Armenian? - No. - My name's Haig. Vahé. How did you learn that? I was born in Istanbul. I did Turkish military service. The Turks taught you to make bombs? What do you think? I was their best pupil. Hi. This is from our Basque comrades in ETA. Will it do? Yes. Perfect. Now you are Jacques Mercier. A pure Frenchman. Jacques Mercier. What's my job? If asked, say you've forgotten. - Seriously. - I'm serious. You say you don't remember. You're an amnesiac. OK? Take care. Beautiful, isn't it? I may never see it again. Show me your wallet. Come on. What are you doing? Here. Sorry, but you can't keep these. Aram didn't mean what he said. But what does he want from me? Did you call Vahé? Many times. He says he hasn't seen Aram for a week. He's lying. And the university? They haven't seen him. Anouch. Tell me the truth. Aram will come back, I'm sure. You're hiding something. I know nothing, I swear on my mother. Your mother's lost her mind, so you can swear on her. The office is rented by the year. A waste of money, but we've no choice. Its best feature: a clear and unobstructed view of the Turkish Embassy. Isn't that beautiful? I come every day so people see it's occupied. Poetry's not everything. Here's what you'll do. The ambassador leaves his office at 9pm. It's already dark then, so no lights or cigarettes here. Are you sure? - Sure of what? - The time. The ambassador studied in Germany. He respects times. The police open the barrier for him to leave. Our van comes down the street, goes past the embassy and stops. The ambassador's car comes out, finds the van in the way, and stops. The driver gets out, opens the boot, takes some flowers out to deliver. The driver blows his horn. And at that moment: boom. Got it? Turkish Embassy Who presses the button? You, of course. Anahit will be driving. A girl attracts less attention. I'll cover her escape, if she's chased. You'll have 2 or 3 seconds. Too soon, Anahit will die. Too late, he may leave the car. - Got it? - OK. Get some rest. In a few hours, you'll be another man. Hell, what's he doing? Move, for God's sake. Fucking hell. Are you a relative? I'm Julien's fiancée. We're medical students. OK. We won't amputate his right leg. But I'm scared of gangrene. He'll need you. - There. - Hello. Hello. Bye now. Hello. Bye. Attack on the Turkish Embassy: Death of the ambassador and his driver Dear family, we won't meet again, but I've gone to do what you don't dare to do. You had to survive. But we must restore Armenia and its rights. I'll bring you justice and pride. Love, Aram. Bad news? Vahé, I want to find my son. I know nothing. The Turkish ambassador's dead. To hell with him. Is Aram involved in this? I asked you a question. Was he involved in the attack, yes or no? Yes. Where is he? Beirut. He's gone to fight. I wish I'd gone. What will you do now? Will you tell the police? How many times will you read this letter? You always gave in to him. Look at the result. My son's gone mad. He's a murderer. You can't say that. Go away! Leave me alone! Aram. The smallest clue might be useful, do you see? Gilles, make an effort. Was someone in the street? No? I don't know. A noise? A noise that sounded strange? He played the piano standing. Who? France Gall's song. It was in my head. He played the piano standing. Know it? I love that song. Don't tell me the boy was mad What can I say to you? A noise that bursts your eardrums. Your legs are blown to pieces, yet you feel no pain. As if it happened to someone else. Then you pass out. Nothing more. That OK? Who do you think could have done it? No one's claimed it, but we think it was Armenian terrorists. What's that to do with our son? We know nothing of Armenia. Exactly. They do it to make you know. To make everyone know. I'm sorry for you. Tomorrow Father Breteau's coming to see you. - You'd like that? - Who cares? Gilles, please. Life is a gift from God. He's taken mine back. I don't know why. - Shall I come with you? - No. Stay here. They all want money. I don't know if it's for them or their cause. This is Burj Hammud. Since the genocide, Armenia is here. It was a vast slum. Just sheds built in the mud by refugees. Your parents are here? I visit them from time to time. My mother had me late. My father didn't want kids. He'd seen Turks betting on the sex of embryos, then ripping pregnant women open. - Come on. - Won't you talk to them? I saw them, that's enough. Go on, pull it up! Your mother can pay me later. Not bad. Can you do better at 25m? I don't know. I'll try. I'd do better with a Turk. I need a word with you. Right away? I'll wait for you. I recognize the Japanese. Kurds, Palestinians, too. - Where are the redheads from? - Belfast. The Internationale accepts even redheads. Vrej? Sit down. Good, Aram. Good. You'll be a good fighter. But there's one thing you mustn't do any more. Vahé said you called to ask about that guy... What was his name, now? I forget. Tessier. Gilles Tessier. You asked if he was better. - Isn't that normal? - Not at all. There'll be lots of innocent victims. A pity, but we can't help it. Understand? You're a soldier, not a nun. I haven't joined to do just anything. Calm down. One more thing. Don't hang around Anahit. You know the rules. Don't get close to other fighters. It's dangerous, Aram. Is that all? For today, yes. Come on, relax. Homeland or death. Know what "Vrej" means? No. Vengeance. My father's idea. Good idea, no? Vengeance now! Stop taking those. You're no good in the morning. You're lucky, you can sleep. Tomorrow I've a delivery for the Azilazians. I think of Aram all the time. Do like me. Pretend he's dead. Don't talk like that! Don't say that! Don't say that! Stop it! Stop it. Oriental Grocer's - I have to go in backwards. - OK. - Here too? - Yes. Go on. Remove the seat. Put me there. Right. - Like that? - Yes. You scared I'll piss on myself? Go on. Don't hold me. Don't get mad. You're improving every day. Shut up. I can't stand your encouragement, your pity and your lies. I haven't improved, I know. It's not true. How can you know how I feel? - I observe you. - You observe nothing. You love me, and that makes you blind. Go on, piss off. - Gilles. - Piss off, will you? I beg you. Piss off! I don't want to see you! Or anyone else! Where have they gone? Is there no dinner? Have you seen the time? Nounée has school tomorrow. Remember? I'm sorry. I keep thinking someone will come to say my son is dead. Me too. I want him to come home. We don't have much time. Hurry up. You want to. So do I. Yes, but not like this, in between errands. Vrej is right. We mustn't get involved. At any moment, you may die, or... go to prison. Yes, come in. Hello. I'm Anouch Alexandrian. I am... I wanted to tell you I'm ashamed, with all my heart. I'm Armenian. I'm ashamed of my people, the Armenian people. I wanted to apologize. I don't know where Armenia is. I care nothing for Armenians. I don't want apologies. Get out. - I understand. - I don't think so. Do you understand my life is ruined? I came from Marseille. I wanted... Here. Our address, if you need something. I need my legs. Maybe it was my son who did it. But he's left France. I think he's in Beirut. Oriental Grocer's Ararat Are you all right? "There was once a king who was very lonely. "So one day he said: "'Whoever asks me a question "'I can't answer will get a treasure.'" I have a question. Where is Aram? Aram? Gone to find Grandma's house. Did he find it? Of course. I'll carry on. And Mum? Where is she? I don't know. I won! I won a treasure! You're my treasure. It's her. Lie down. Where've you been? I've been worried sick. Have you eaten? I looked for you all day. At 6am you'd already gone. I was scared you... you'd do something silly. I called the hospitals. I took a plane this morning. I went to see Tessier, in Paris. I had to. Why do that? Are you crazy? I told him Aram was involved. Hello. Hello, darling. You're in good hands, with Prof. Louvet. He's the best surgeon, internationally known. For the price, he'd better be good. I studied with him. He was way above the rest. - He'll make you walk. - Of course he'll walk. I want my son to run, swim, jump, dance like a madman. Can't you stop? Sit down and let's make the guest list. We can't invite fewer than 300 people. We're not getting married. I love you, Valérie. Dad, take me away, please. Stay with me. I want to grow old with you, have kids with you. I won't be able to carry them. Hush! I want to live with you. I don't see it like that. You think you're in a movie? You can use one hand, but it's more accurate with two. Legs apart. Shoot with the head as well as the eyes. Remember who you're shooting, and why. Go on then. That's better, Simon. In Rome, the bomb must go off at 6pm, when people are going home. Anahit has friends in lotta armata. They'll handle the logistics. Any questions? Yes. Why not do it at night, when the street's empty? The answer's easy. For a country to break with Turkey, it must be very scared. Our acts must affect its policies, call into question its leaders. Too bad for the victims. We can't help it. Material damage doesn't scare people now. The Turkish Airlines staff are pawns. Not linked to the dictatorship. Some of them may be Italian. The public will go against us. We must target only the authorities, like before. Just when they're talking of Armenia in Geneva, Copenhagen, Paris, Milan! Are you mad? You're François Lemerry, born in Belfort. A new identity for each attack is good to ease your conscience. François Lemerry is new, with no blood on his hands. Jacques Mercier keeps dreaming he's paralyzed, a man in white tells him to move his toes and he can't, however loud he shouts. I don't oblige you to do it! But if you do it, you follow my orders! Is that clear? Very clear. Aram. Stop it. Shit. Wait for me. Wait, I beg you. Aram. What's wrong? Have you wounded an innocent man? No. I hope you never will. Aram. You couldn't help it. Stop thinking about it. If we could do that, we wouldn't be here fighting. We do think. Men think, that's how it is. Real men think. The others are animals. Ever been to Rome? Never. They say it's the most beautiful place. We won't be there long, you know. I have a bad feeling. You think we'll be in hiding long? We've just heard of a bombing in Rome, outside a Turkish Airlines agency. No one's claimed responsibility, but it looks like the work of Armenian terrorists. We don't yet know the number of victims. Arménouch Armenia Stories of Armenia Armenian Tales Is it him? It's him. Hello. It's my daughter's birthday party. No one knows who you are. Don't tell them. Why did you come to see me? I hoped that... I thought if Aram saw you, he might stop doing these attacks. Really? - Are you sure? - He's not a bad person. You're not eating? I want to see his room. "His room..." It's a long time since he left. His room... On the first floor. You can carry me. On your shoulders. Aram? Is that you, Aram? My mother-in-law. She keeps calling for Aram. She's lost her mind. She doesn't have much longer. Careful. There. Nothing's changed since he left. His mother won't let us touch it. - How old is he? - Same as you. It's like any student's room. What did you expect? A terrorist's lair? Did you see what happened in Rome? A girl saw her grandpa die. Most Armenians are against violence. Except for your son. Well, I guess you're hungry after your trip. Sorry. Taste this. Eat without fear. I cooked it. That goes on top. Can I stay the night here? I didn't have time to book a hotel. It's delicious. Thanks. Don't stand watching me. Your guests will want you. France Gall He played the piano standing Show me your hands. What do you... My hands are empty. - Why ask me that? - You had a knife. You were going... to slit my throat. Don't touch me.

Do your parents know you're here? No. No one knows. They'll be worried. I'll call them tomorrow. I'll say I've gone to a hotel, to forget things. Good night. Hello. Anna? Where are you from? Moush. It's there. And you, Verguiné? Trabzon. Trabzon. It's there. - Sineth? - Kars. There's Kars, there's Van, and I'm from Erzurum. You see, Gilles, this is... the border drawn by President Wilson. This is the Armenia the Armenians claim. The Kurdistan claimed by the Kurds. The western powers gave in to Kemal and his alliance with the Soviet Union. They gave in to the British, wanting Mosul's oil and to the French, also wanting their share of the spoils. After the Lausanne treaty, the borders were wiped out. It's still like that. The victors, the powerful divide the world to suit themselves. They think languages, lands, history are not important. 100 years later, it's blowing up in their face. - You told him everything? - Yes. - Did you talk about me? - No. Anouch, I'm under surveillance. Understand? By the Turks and French. I'm glad you said nothing. - What does Tessier want? - To talk to Aram. Tell him he's here. It might make him think. It's hotting up over there. They're close to a split. Those opposed to indiscriminate attacks versus those who approve. Not a good time. Hovannès, help Gilles! Where were you? Where was I? Praying in church, as usual on April 24. I couldn't go this afternoon. - I prayed for you, Gilles. - And Aram? I pray for who I want! You telling me how to pray now? Do you know what happened on April 24? Yes. I know. The Istanbul Armenians were picked up and never seen again. I know all that! I can't stand this. I don't want to hear any more stories. Bombs have exploded in Geneva and Rome! In Zurich and Madrid! In Copenhagen and Tehran! In our veins flows the precious blood of our heroic ancestors! Over 100 attacks by our fighters, who fear nothing. Long live Armenia! The party held a meeting Decided the dog Talaat should die Tehlirian was given the chance Wine, my brother To the health of the drinkers Talaat Pacha fled to Berlin Tehlirian caught him Brought him down with a bullet in the head Talaat was buried The news went to his senile mother Long live the German court The Turks are making us mad. Think of that girl who saw her grandfather die. "After Rome's innocent victims, "the irresponsibility "of some leaders "who organize attacks that are indiscriminate, "though legitimate, against Turkish interests, "gives results counter "to those that were intended." Hello, Mr Tessier. Sorry about the security, but I just escaped a car bomb. The Turks are angry at our actions. Levon Minassian: proof of his innocence "Young Armenians have taken up arms. "They'll shed the blood of our enemies "along with their own blood." Do you approve of the attacks on Turkish diplomats? Of course. And those who kill innocent outsiders? I know that's unjust. 1.5 million innocent Armenians died. That was also a huge injustice. Turkey is a fascist state. Its diplomats are fascists. 30,000 prisoners are tortured each day. That's a dictatorship, Mr Tessier. We are asking them for territorial reparations. I'm a communist and an anti-imperialist. When we can cultivate our land, when we can live in the land where we were born, which is the only wealth, the borders will disappear. They won't be needed to protect the bourgeois' profits. - So the end justifies the means? - No. But ends require means. I prefer to say that. Sorry about your legs, but it's war. What can I do for you? I have no weapon. Don't worry. I want to see the men who did this. Did you tell the police about your trip? They can't help me any more. Vahé, I've known you since you were born. Will you tell Aram Gilles Tessier wants to see him. - Do it for me. - It's madness. Even if Aram agrees, can he go to Beirut alone? I'll go with him. We'll be careful. You think he'll feel pity for you? I want to see the man who ruined my life. That's all. It won't make you walk. Who knows? Orly South This afternoon This is the tragic, horrible sight left by the bombing of Orly South air terminal. The explosion was this afternoon, at 2.11 exactly. There was a large crowd. Over 100 people thronged around the Turkish Airlines desk. They were checking in luggage. They thought they were going on holiday. I was leaving, I saw a "boom", a suitcase exploded, there were flames, smoke, people torn apart. - You saw a case? - Yes, on the floor. On fire. People running. Where did the explosion come from? I wasn't looking. I saw a flash of light. Maybe 20 metres away. The hall was packed. Like the subway in the rush hour. Emergency services are here. Val-de-Marne's chief of police is in charge. The wounded are being evacuated, by ambulance and helicopter, to Paris hospitals. The bomb was apparently made in Czechoslovakia. Three of our compatriots have been arrested and given long prison sentences, but never mind. Each trial is a chance to proclaim openly the truth about the Armenian genocide, and to make public the legitimacy of our demand for the return of our land. Each trial is worth more than dozens of lectures, more than hundreds of peaceful demonstrations and thousands of pamphlets. We must make our attacks more frequent. Wherever there is an Armenian, there must be an attack. Thanks to our diaspora, we can strike anywhere, all over the world, spreading as wide as possible the aims of the Armenian revolution. Arafat said the other day: "We won't be the new Armenians." My reply to him is this: "We Armenians "will be the new Palestinians." Comrade Armenak, speak. I've always thought that... armed struggle was the only way... to defend the Armenian cause. Our cause. No one can accuse me of copping out, can they? I've given my life to it. What are you saying? That you're tired? You can't run as fast as before? You get out of breath? Go ahead! You well deserve your retirement. It's not about me, or retirement. It's about whether the justness of our cause guarantees the justness of our actions. The publicity you seek does not justify what you are proposing. You're going too far, Vrej. But what do you suggest? First we must stop this escalation. We all know public opinion is turning against us. Then we should announce in the press that we're calling a halt and changing our strategy. That's my suggestion. Until proven otherwise, our army is commanded by me. Let's be clear. I'm not forcing anyone. Those who don't want to obey orders can leave! Band of cowards. Why didn't you go with him? There was room. I couldn't leave you. That's why you stayed? For me? We're not allowed to love, Aram. You're completely mistaken. I didn't leave my family to have a love affair with you. Nor did you, I hope. Vrej is going insane. No, Aram. He's sacrificing his life for the cause. - Is that what you want too? - You're asking me? Yes. That's what I want. I thought you agreed. Guess what? In a few days, I'll be in Lisbon. Car bombing the Turkish consulate. I'll come with you. Vrej won't agree to that. Why not? He doesn't trust me, right? Isn't he right? Remember what you told him? You said you'd only accept shootings at point blank range. You! You love life too much. I've been dead a long time. Why is he with your mother? Fetch him, it's going cold. Is it true that Gilles set off a bomb? - Who said that? - Martha, in school. Martha's talking nonsense. Eat your salad. I want my ashes scattered where I was born, in Marmashen. That's our land. Aram, promise me? I promise you. Is Grandma going to be burnt? Yes. She wanted that. Then her ashes will be put inside an urn. It was wonderful. So many people. So many, the church was full. I saw Gilles Tessier too. Anouch said he was close to your grandmother. Aram, you must meet this guy. Meet him in Beirut, with your mother. - What can I say? - I don't know. Aram, tell him you don't agree. That the attacks have caused harm and have been bad for the Armenian cause. Imagine a dialogue between him and you, now. You must do it. Trust me. OK. Tell him to come. They can go to Barsam's. I'll contact them. Thanks, Aram. Take care. You too. Anahit and Simon are off to Lisbon next week. Their target's the Swiss embassy. "Simon"? He's just a beginner. You were once, too. - Have you forgotten? - No. Anyway, I'm meeting Tessier. With my mother. Vahé's sending them. He'll tell all the world about us. Don't do that, Aram. You still trust that traitor Vahé. Yes, Vrej. I'm finished here. I'm leaving. Armenak is right, you're leading a band of bloody killers. Stay here. I order you. You're an idiot. Maybe the guy is controlled by the French secret services. - Didn't you think? - He's right. He's right? Yes, he's right. You always think he's right. Vrej Ludzel. So? Stay with him, then. Aram. Aram! No, not that! I came to see Gilles. Are you Valérie? Come with me. Mrs Kertekian, I'll be back. "...chewing, he undid all the net." Well done. Come, darling. Leave Gilles now. - I haven't finished reciting. - Stay there. You see the progress? It's the Marseille air. Come on, darling. If you need me, I'm here. Nounée, come on now. I thought of you all the time. Same here. Wait. You've found a new family. No. It's nothing like that. I understand some things better now. You're going to see that guy? I hope so. You're crazy. Hello. Excuse me. Gilles told me you were very pretty. He was right. - Will you stay for dinner? - No. Thank you. I'll be frank. I don't like Gilles staying with you. That's not moving on. You know, sometimes you can never move on. If Gilles wants to see his attacker, I understand him. And his attacker's my son. Imagine. Do you think it's fun for me? - I live there! - Your papers! How can I get through? But I live there, I tell you! Why are you here? I'm going home from work! You have family here? No. I've come to see my son. Your brother? You could say that. There you are. - Bye. - Thanks. Stay here. - I'll get help. - OK. This is Barsam. Hello. Gilles Tessier. Vahé told me about you. Barsam's lost touch with Aram. I heard he left Vrej's camp a few days ago. He must be with Armenak. You know, these are sad times for us. Armenians are killing one another. The worst thing ever. I wonder how I'd have lived in Beirut. Why did you go to Marseille? It was an arranged Armenian marriage. My mother had been raped dozens of times over months. So no one would marry her. My father was 40 years older. He'd lost his wife, children, parents. He agreed to marry her. He was a good man. He had time to produce me, but 3 years later he died. - Are you OK? - Yes. - Shall I help you? - No. It's fine. Thanks. And so she took the boat to Marseille, to join the only man who would have her. They'd never met. Thanks. And amazingly, they loved each other. Thanks. Enjoy! Hovannès's food is better. Yes. Anouch is a pretty name. It sounds like a young girl's name. Anouch. You schemed to get us both here. Since the hospital, you've had one goal: to save your son. Am I right? It's true. But I didn't know it'd save you too. That makes me very happy. I'm sure you'll go back to your medical studies. What makes you so sure? Is it God? We can't live all our lives in anger. Maybe not all our lives, but how old did your mother live to be? My son. You look beautiful, Mum. So beautiful. I never thought you'd come here. I did. I always told your father. You must believe. Is he OK? And Nounée? - I really miss her. - They're fine. They send their love. You're very thin, son. Mum. I don't have much time. Is he here? Aram's here. Coming. Will you sit down? Yes. It's better for me. You're recording us? Vahé asked me to. So he can publish my confession? He said say what you want. And you can edit it later. That's OK, but he doesn't live here. He still thinks the Armenians are united. That's now impossible. I often remember you, Gilles. Your smiling face as you tried to get between the cars. You couldn't get through, and you smiled. I'm sorry. You're innocent. But I'm not guilty. I know who's guilty. Turkish fascists, negationists and governments that support them. I understand your act. But that doesn't justify it. I regret nothing. Regrets are for tombstones. I'll go on fighting against Turkey until it admits its atrocities and gives us back our land. You'll fight by any means? No. I left the camp where I was. I don't agree with the attacks that just add to the list of victims. Others like me are planning new approaches. Non-violent ones? For 60 years, the Armenians were non-violent. It achieved nothing. We achieved more in the last 5 years than in the previous 50. That's how it is. And you, Gilles? Ever thought of revenge? Yes. At first I dreamed of it. I dreamed of smashing your leg to pieces. Then I stopped. I knew that what made me live was not revenge, but the desire to understand. And now? What's your dream? I'd like all the dead to be at peace. And my legs back. See, Gilles, what's terrible is that you've proved us right. You've become our best ambassador. I don't regret, but I ask forgiveness. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Won't you come home and face trial? I can't leave my comrades while things are not sorted out. Aram, come back soon, for God's sake. You won't get too hard a sentence. Juries are always moved by our story. One day, maybe. Genocide has made us mad. We only exist because of it. We were born on a pile of corpses. That's how it is. I'll come tomorrow at the same time, OK? You can tell me about Dad and Nounée. OK? Is that all right? Aram! Simon. Ten years later, after the fall of the USSR, in the new Armenia. Hovannès would have loved to have been with us. But it's better he didn't come. Why didn't he come? We never close the shop. Not for baptisms or funerals. Never. In 33 years, we haven't closed for even a day. Marmashen Is Turkey over there? We call it "occupied Armenia". If the soldiers see us, we'll go to jail. I'll keep watch. Wait. OK. Go on. Arsinée Sarkissian, Born 27 June... in Marmashen Died 18 April... in Marseille There. She's come home. To her land. As if she'd never been driven away. She asked this of Aram, and he promised. Not "asked". Ordered. My mother never asked. She always ordered. And I'm still obeying her. I had an idea, for the holidays. Would Valérie like to spend a few days in Marseille? - Hovannès has bought a boat. - Good idea. Know what'll happen? One day Turkey will acknowledge the genocide. All the Armenians will come to buy the stolen land. They'll build holiday homes around Mount Ararat. They'll need churches too. In a few generations, with their business flair, they'll rebuild old Armenia. You believe that? I have faith. I can't help it. To my Turkish comrades, in honour of our shared struggles.
