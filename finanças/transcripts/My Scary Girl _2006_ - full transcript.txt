Wait! - WiII you be aII right? - It's aII right, aII right. I shouId wash up because of the sweat. That's oKay. I can eat saIty because I have Iow bIood pressure. Do you reaIIy IiKe me? Even if I'm not the person you hoped for? I IiKe you just the way you are right now. - I don't care about your past, now. - ReaIIy? - You reaIIy don't care about my past, right? - Of course. - As Iong you didn't KiII anyone. - What? It's a joKe, a joKe. - See. It's saIty. - No, this is just the fIavor. I Iove it. - What are you doing? - I wrote a poem. It's been 3 years since I had an inspiration. Let me see... It's in EngIish... It's because it's my major. Read it to me in transIation. LiKe a poet. - It shouId be read in the originaI Ianguage. - Come on. Oh, good. More good, Very good. Very good... The transIation is a bit... - It sounds aII right to me. - ReaIIy? Then, I'II read it again. Oh, good, More good, Very good.

No, she went to the store. I'II taIK to you Iater, then. AII right. Stabbing it yesterday, slicing it today. There isn't even any kimchi in the house. But why did she buy such a big kimchi fridge? I'm dating... LEE Ml JA Lee Mi-ja and not Lee Mina. That guy, before... does he caII you these days? - Who? - You Know, the bowIing pin. No, I mean... I don't contact him after then. Why? Does it stiII bother you? No, no, no, no. Why does it taKe so Iong when it's not even shadowing or bugging? AII right, yes. No, just personaI information and... And her past affairs. Find out her affairs for me, pIease. Yes. What? No not the current one but the past ones. Yes, aII right. PIease hurry. Yes. She married when she was 22. After 6 months, she was tried for murdering her husband. She was acquitted for Iegitimate seIf-defense. Seems IiKe the domestic vioIence was severe from the beginning. There are rumors that she Iived with severaI different men untiI 2 years ago. But it's not in writing so it's not cIear. And, yes. According to the papers, she's married another time Iast year. Yes, have a IooK at this. They say this oId man's Iawyer introduced her to him. It seems the inheritance amount is enormous. SmeIIs a bit IiKe a goId-digger, huh? - An inheritance? - Yes. He died of a heart attacK 3 months ago. Was it reaIIy a heart attacK? As far as my investigations, it is. But if you give me more time and money Then I couId find out more in detaiI. That's oKay. - Three peopIe's enough. - Excuse me? What's wrong? Are you feeIing sicK? HeIIo? It's me. CanceI the SingapoIe trip. What? You're a thief, man. What penaIty between friends! What? Whatever the reguIations just taKe 10/%, you asshoIe! What are you doing? Isn't it nice to proceed things faster? What's the probIem? Don't you Know it's better to Ieave earIy as possibIe? StiII, how can you move out my things without a word with me? Is this about that guy named Hwang Dae-woo? You were so smart but what happened to you? Is now the time to be dating around? - What if he found out? - He doesn't Know anything. Get a grip on yourseIf! A grip! It couId aII end with one mistaKe! Yes. When we were on our second date, you toId me a strange joKe. BacK then, I thought you were weird. You Know... You seemed a bit boring, from having studied too much. And you sIipped the necKIace in my bag whiIe I went to the bathroom. We Kissed that day. Do you remember? - Are you mad at me or something? - What is it that you want to say to me? I'II be Ieaving for ItaIy soon. ItaIy? ItaIy or wherever, won't you join me? Who are you reaIIy? I'm just IiKe that woman. Being with the person she IiKes, Iaughing, hoping to enjoy Iife... such normaI person. What the... Come here! Since it's the Iast time, asK her to have a drinK, oKay? And Keep offering drinKs. Then, switch them when she's passed out from getting drunK. There's the one in EngIish which is about 10 pages Iong. You Know EngIish, right? ABCD. What wouId she do taKing the money with her? She'd just buy pizzas. It's aII an outfIow of nationaI weaIth. Don't you Know the outfIow of nationaI weaIth? That money's so precious. ParK it for me. And so, big sister, when you pass out from getting drunK he toId me to switch it. Since he didn't see you actuaIIy KiII, he didn't Know what he was saying. CouId you pIease cut this for me? - Don't foIIow me, you crazy bitch! - I won't, you cranKy oId man. Just for practice... Oh, no. I can't because I didn't draw so weII. AII right. I understand. You get so shy about it. But how did you KiII a person when you're so shy, huh? - Why are you sweating so much? - What sweat? - TaKe it off. It's hot. - I'II be going soon, anyway. - You IooK suffocated so taKe it off. - I said I'm fine IiKe this. Stop it and just taKe it off... LooK at the sweat on your forehead. - Come on... - Oh, aII right. OKay, oKay! I'II taKe it off... What's that inside? - What? This? - Oh, my... What are you doing? Were you that scared? That I might stab you with a Knife? I was feeIing a bit weaK these days so I'm Iearning Kumdo. I went for practice today and I forgot to taKe it off. So...? You're going to ItaIy? ItaIy, that's nice. If you bury it in the AIps then nobody wouId Know. Can't even get you fruit because you're so scared. Who says I'm scared? Come on, Mi-ja... ReaIIy, why couIdn't you just bear it? Why'd you have to KiII? I thought you'd accidentaIIy KiII one. But there wasn'tjust one. If I didn't then I wouId've died. You even saw him for yourseIf that day. He's just a scum taKing advantage of Jang-mee! Who are you taIKing about now? Jang-mee's boyfriend? - You KiIIed him, too? - Itjust happened that way. And, I thought... I'm so stunned that I can onIy Iaugh. Is murdering peopIe your hobby? Do you thinK I feeI great after having KiIIed someone? I feeI reaIIy miserabIe, too! Is that an expression of agony after KiIIing someone? You IooK IiKe someone who's here to pay for the neighbor's gIass you happened to breaK. But why did you have to KiII an oId dying man? FooIish, insignificant, and mean... He was a sicK oId man who was a burden on everyone. He was bound to die soon. So I just speeded it up a bit. If the oId man's secretIy hidden money is spent weII by someone, isn't that a better thing? So you did KiII him. You sure did. Crime and Punishment. ''FooIish, insignificant, and mean...'' Do you quote DostoyevsKy IiKe this? - I'II be going. - AIready? Considering the circumstances, I thought I couId have you turn yourseIf in. I was even wiIIing to wait for you deIivering private food for 2~3 years. But you are at Ieast a Iife sentence. Hey, no! No, don't... It's drawn badIy, isn't? TeII me, honestIy. Who is it that you drew? Yon-sama. What? It's Bae Yong-joon. Why did you draw Bae Yong-joon? Other Kids at the academy were drawing it. And I thought it was me. I was moved for nothing. Shit. - Want me to draw you one? - Forget it! It's Bae Yong-joon? Having a muffIer maKes it Bae Yong-joon? If your bacK stiII hurts you, try having some centipede powder. Others say this is the best time when they're in a reIationship. But what's wrong with me? PIease meet someone eIse quicKIy and have a fun time. Is it that easy to meet and say good bye? It's because it's your first time. If you Keep meeting peopIe, then they're soon forgotten. And... They even say that first Ioves never come true. Are you serious? What Kind of a woman are you? ReaIIy... It's just that I'm sorry, too. WeII... good bye. Excuse me... Aren't you going to Kiss me? A good bye Kiss? We won't be abIe to see each other ever again, you Know. - Ah, forget it! Don't, if you don't want to. - No, Iet's do it. Let's! Do I have to teII you every IittIe thing? Isn't it common sense? - Dae-woo. - What? Why didn't you report me in? What? Why didn't you report me to the poIice? How can I turn in the person I Iove? The person I Iove. Are you serious, now? Come to ItaIy with me. - You Know that I can't. - PIease... pIease come with me. Don't do this, Mina. Why not? Why? Why not when you Iove me? ReaIIy! Why did you have to KiII so many! If it was onIy one, I wouId've tried to understand. But how? This is reaIIy driving me crazy. When some people visit the place of their first kiss, they say they think of their past love. Whenever that person's song is heard, there are people who reminisce. As for me... Every time l see news about the discovery of a secretly buried corpse in the mountains, l think of her. 2 years later, Singapore lnt'l Airport - Wow! ReaIIy! - How Iong has it been? - About 2 years? - What brings you here? I'm going to London on a business trip. But the transferring time got Iong, so I came out on a tour. Same with me. I'm on my way to Sydney. By the way I heard they found a corpse in Kangwon Province from the news a few days ago... - It suddenIy reminded me of you, Mina. - Oh! ReaIIy? By any chance, did you bury one at ChiaK Mountain? No, no. It wasn't ChiaK but... It's, honestIy, hard to teII you... - PIease understand. - Yes, of course. Don't teII me. You shouIdn't be just teIIing it, of course! How's ItaIy? It's true about how you become patriots when you're overseas. I thinK about Korea a Iot. - Why don't you visit once? - You Know why. How can I go bacK there? I have to Iive outside for the rest of my Iife. Do you have to go now? Yes, it's aImost time for departure. WeII, then... Mina! Yes? Come on in when the period for prosecution expires! What? - I'II see you then. - AII right. Then, wiII we see each other again? At that time, there wouId be someone beside me. Someone to grow oId with... - Then I'II just KiII her. - What? -= FIT ??Ļ?? =- ?? ?????????? ???? ?? ?? ??Ʒ??ţ? 020 ?? ????Ļ????ѧϰ?ͽ???ʹ?? ?????????κ???ҵĿ?ġ? ʹ?ñ???Ļ????ɵ?һ?к?????? Fit Ӱ????̳?޹ء?
