Hey, uh... It's all right. Yeah, I think so. I really screwed up. Yes, it is. I never expected any of this. I would... I crossed the line. Felix, without you, this company would not be what it is today. My father loved working with you, just as I know you loved working with him. This has been difficult for us all. We're really going to miss you around here. Oh, that face. Your energy. Expertise. But I do know that Anne, your beautiful wife... I'm sure she's just going to be delighted to have you all to herself. So, to Felix. May the next chapter treat you well. I'm so happy for you. Thank you. I know Dan couldn't be here today. He's off golfing or traipsing around the world or living the life that he so richly deserves. But he was my mentor. I owe him everything. It's been an honor to work with you all, to know you, to learn from you. And, Hillary, I only hope that you can maintain the integrity and the innovation that is the cornerstone of this firm. However, I want you all to know that I am not going gently into this good light. On the contrary, this is merely a transition. I encourage you all to... to call me if you need any help... or if I can be of any service. Thanks. Thank you. Felix, before you go. We got you a little parting gift. - How'd you get those? - Well, it wasn't easy. - It wasn't cheap. - Wow. Open it. Okay. We didn't want you getting lonely with all your newfound free time. What? It's a buddy for you. It's not a buddy. It's an augmented reality companion. Companion. Assistant. Whatever. Thank you. Go ahead, try it on. No, I've got to pack up. It's my daughter's birthday tonight, so... thanks. Thank you all. Thanks. - Thanks, Felix. - Thank you, Felix. Happy birthday to Grace. How was the party, Dad? It wasn't really a party. More of just a lunch. But it was fine. It was good. What did Dan say? Dan wasn't there. It was just Hillary. - That little shit. - Honey. I want to see the watch. You know what? They didn't give me a watch. They gave me something else. But they said it was very expensive. Well, must be nice knowing you get to live in your sweatpants from now on. Don't put me out to pasture just yet. I'm delighted for you, honey. I'm a little jealous, but I am delighted. Oh, you can wear your sweatpants to work anytime. Yeah, sure. Why not? So do you have big birthday plans with your friends? Uh, Ben's taking me out for sushi tomorrow night and we're going to meet up with Eve and her boyfriends. Oh, Eve. How is she? - Who? - You met her. I can't keep them straight, I swear. How is everything with Ben? Good. Great, actually. Everything okay? Yeah. Uh... What's up? Okay, it's not a big deal. Grace? Okay. - Ben and I... - Oh, my God, you're pregnant. What? No! Oh, my God! Would you let her answer, please? No. No. Uh, we have been thinking about moving in together. What? Oh. That's it. Well, it seems... fast. - Mom. - What? You've only been seeing each other for a few months. - I know, but we're... - Felix? I think it's great. You do? Really? What the hell? You're old enough. You'll learn. You feel ready? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Okay. Wow. Also, we already found a place and put down a deposit, so... Okay. - Look at you. - Oh, my God. You were a beauty. Wait, that was still your first place, right? That's right, and your father and I dated for two whole years before we moved in together. - Oh, my God. - All right! Way to make a point. Good for you, honey. Hey, that's what I could do. I could be a birthday clown now. Well, she seems happy. Yup. It's a big day for you. Yes, it is. How are you feeling? Oh, I don't know. You know, yes, it's great for us. - Yeah. - Sure. Felix, I know that you felt pushed out, but I do think that this could be very good for you and for us. Okay. You coming up? - Soon. - Okay. I just want to finish some emails. All right. I'll see you up there. Okay. I love you. Hey. Congratulations. Welcome to Auggie, where seeing is believing. And we believe in a future together, not alone. Be it an executive assistant or personal companion, Auggie determines your needs by reading your subconscious brain signals via sensors consolidated into the arms of the glasses. A microprocessor integrated into the bridge of the frame projects the desired companion onto the user's environment. Simply put the glasses on and say hello. And the fridge is pretty much empty, so if you wouldn't mind running to the store? Felix? Okay. All right. I love you. And I love you. - Enjoy today. - Yeah. Yeah, maybe I'll write a novel. Come on, you know I can't. Well, I mean, it is my favorite flavor. No. You know I need to watch my intake. Stop it. Oh, God, yes. I know I deserve it. The new me. You really think I deserve chocolate chips and nibs? You are too much! Okay. Oh, God! Oh, you are just over the top. Felix? Hey, there. It's okay. I know this is strange. - Yeah, I'm sorry. - Don't be. I... I wasn't expecting this. Why? You're so pretty. I'm sorry, what do I call you? I'm Auggie. Of course you are. Um... Nice to meet you? Likewise. You're staring. Yeah, I'm sorry. Oh, excuse me. Hey. Hey, did you go to the store yet? - Yeah. - Oh. I forgot to mention we needed detergent. You didn't pick up any, did you? - I didn't, no. I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. I'll just grab it on the way home. Okay. All right, I'll talk to you later? - All right, bye. - Okay. Yeah, bye. So if you accept it would mean longer hours, but, of course, a significant pay increase. More control over operations, final approval on pitches, et cetera. I feel like I'm leaving something out. Oh, and it would also mean more contact with me. Unfortunately. Joy. I know, and that's awful, but, uh... so, what do you think? Hey! Oh, hey. Honey, you're here. - You tired? - Hmm? You seem tired. Yeah. I'm tired. I'm sorry. Oh, did you see the pictures that Grace sent us? Oh, not yet. Oh, honey... I got to tell you about this story about this lady I saw in the grocery store today. So she's standing in the aisle, and she was wearing these glasses. - Mm-hmm? - Hon, I got this. And it was funny, because they were the same glasses that the company gave me. - So... - Mm. Felix? I'm so exhausted. Can you tell me about this in the morning? - Yeah, of course. - I'm sorry, honey. - It's okay. - Mmm. Will you be very quiet when you come upstairs? Yeah. Hey. How was your day? It was fine. Just fine? Well, it was kind of slow. I'm transitioning professionally. Out of architecture. Yeah, how'd you know that? I know everything about you, Felix. Relax, I'm... I'm just kidding. Well, kind of. So you're in my head? Correct. And you know everything I'm thinking? Unfortunately. And the way you look? You're not happy with the way I look? No. No, on the contrary, I... You're beautiful. Can I make you look any way I want? Like, can you be a man, or ugly, or something? No. So you look like this to everybody? No. Just for you. Well, that's kind of creepy. There's nothing creepy about it. So today I'm in this grocery store. I see this woman cracking up, okay? Talking to herself. But I guess she wasn't talking to herself. Oh, yeah? What happened? Well, she was wearing these Auggie glasses. So, you know, she's talking to her Auggie. Cool. Yeah, cool. And, uh... she seemed happy. But from my vantage point, it was sort of sad. You know, she seemed very solitary. But was she? I guess she wasn't. Are you? No. Good. Yeah. Ah, Jesus. Look at the time. Yeah, way past your bedtime. Yeah, it is. I'm sorry. I have to go up. Good night, Felix. Good night. How'd you sleep? Pretty great. What time did you come up? I didn't even hear you. Well, honey, you asked me to be quiet. You know, Felix, I know that this retirement thing was unexpected, and it certainly can't be easy. But I just keep thinking about all the times you have talked about wanting to do some consulting. I know. I know. I've been thinking about it too. I mean, hell, it's... It's really what I've been doing the past couple of years. - Right? - I need to start all over again. - Oh, Jesus. - No, no. I know. But, I think about all your connections and your body of work. And, Felix, to be your own boss? I know. All right. I'll put out some feelers. I'll make some calls. I love it. Sorry. Hey, what's up? I... not yet, but I will. That is... Thank you, Jack. No, but I'm on my way in. Mm-hmm. All right. I'm on it. I'll see you soon. Okay, bye. You okay? - Yeah. - What's up? A position has opened up, and Jack has asked me to fill it. Oh. It's the Executive VP of Marketing. Wow. But I didn't want to accept until you and I had a chance to talk about it. All right, well, we're talking. A lot more money? It's more money. It's more hours. It would be more responsibility. But I'll tell you, it's one of those things. I didn't know that I wanted it until it was offered to me. Well, that's great. - Really? - Yeah. You work hard. You deserve it. You'd be great at it. I just think it could be perfect for us right now. I do think it would be a bit of an adjustment, but... I think it's wonderful. Congratulations. Thank you, Felix. - Yeah. - Now I really do have to go. Mwah. I love you. And I love you. Good morning. Hey. It's so beautiful. Isn't it? It's one of my favorite places. Come here all the time. I wanted you to see it. I appreciate it. Shall we? I got it. Come on. It's so quiet. Thank you. For what? Bringing me here. I love it here. I just come out alone, and I sit and ruminate. Just get a lot of my ideas here. I haven't brought anybody here in ages. What about Anne? Well... We don't have to talk about her if you don't want to. It's just, I'm getting used to how this thing works. Honey, I'm sorry I'm late. Stop it. It's okay. Hi. Where were you? I had a meeting with Hillary. Oh. Well, thank God you never have to deal with her again. Ay... Chihuahua. Well, you could have texted me, but I forgive you. Can I get you anything to drink? I'm fine with water, thank you. You got it. So, what was it about? What? Uh, the meeting? Oh, I'm just tying up some loose ends at the office. Uh, Mom told me about her promotion. - I know. - Whoa. - Pretty great. - Yeah. She seems really on edge about me and Ben moving in together. Honey, she loves you. She's concerned. - I... Yeah. - Let her be a mother. - You're right. - Oh, speaking of which. - That's a gift. - What is this? - Just open it. - Oh, my God, Dad! Stop it. That's so sweet. - I know. - Thank you. Wow. I was... I was adorable. - Yes, you were. - I was undeniably adorable. You're going to do just great there. Look at that, Larry. - Where? - In the sky. - What? The stars? - No, Larry, the moon. You want the moon, Auggie? I'll lasso it for you. Hey. You want to join me? Sure. Oh. What? Nothing. What do you want to do tomorrow? I don't know. Where's your creativity? Good question. I guess you're retired. Life's over. You know, you might as well die. All right. You've got a lot more to offer. Yeah, sure. Life's short. Don't waste it. Oh. Hey, I'm sorry, I... I must have fallen asleep. Shh. Go back to sleep. Okay, I will. Sorry. Good night. Wow! What is all this? I hope you're hungry. I'm starving. Sit down. - How was your day? - It was great. We finalized this pitch that we've been struggling with. - Congratulations. That's great. - Well, thank you. What are we celebrating? Well, I spoke to Graciella. She liked the presentation. And she said that she's willing to partner if I can raise the bulk of the initial capital. Wow. So, what are we talking about? Would that come out of our savings? I don't know. Just asking. What are you bringing that up for, huh? Let's not focus on the obstacles, okay? Felix, I'm just asking questions. I just thought that you would be excited for me. Jesus, Anne. You okay? I don't know. I'm just looking for a reason to wake up in the morning. I mean, is it me? Am I being unreasonable? I don't think so. No. I thought this is what she wanted. I mean, for Christ's sake, she initiated it. It's hard to know exactly what other people want. Uh-huh. What do you want? I don't know. Lots of things. Come on. Get up, Felix. I want to show you something. You asked. We delivered. Intimacy on demand. Introducing Auggie Touch. Order yours today. Rush delivery available. Is this what you want? I-I-I don't know. Yeah, in part, okay. You seem unsure. You think? Is it Anne? What? I don't know whether I want to do this. I mean... Is this what you want? Yes. - Felix? - Hey. What's up? I would love to hear more about the partnership. Okay, fine. Can I take a look? There's not much to see right now. But you already sent your presentation over, right? It's just another draft. Well, I would love to see it. Okay. Yeah, fine. Hold on. Yeah. I think it looks great. Thank you. And let's... let's talk about the money. I'm sure that we can figure something out. Honey, it's fine. I swear. Okay? I'll see you upstairs. Okay. I think Kosha and I are going to go back to their place later on. Maybe you and Jim could have a guy's night. Felix? Uh-huh? I know he's not your favorite, but it might be good to make more of an effort. Yeah. Maybe. I just mean outside of work. You should be enjoying yourself. Yeah, yeah. What are you doing? You know what? You go in. What are you talking about? Kosha was looking forward to seeing you. I know. I'm not feeling so hot. Are you okay? Yeah. I have a bug or something. Okay. Okay. Go. You have fun. I love you. Yeah, I love you too. You don't get cold, do you? Oh, pardon me. That's a pretty jacket. Wow. Felix! - Hiya, Jim. - Hey, buddy. I almost didn't recognize you. When'd you, uh, start wearing glasses? Oh... They come with age. You'll find out. Of course, of course. You look great. - Oh, thank you. - So you keeping busy? Yeah. Yeah, you know, I'm doing some consulting work. - That's perfect for you. - It's going well, yeah. So, listen. I've got to get going. Okay. Okay. Oh, hey, let's get together soon. The girls and I will do dinner... I think that's great. You got it. It's a date. All right. Take... Take care. So, wait, tell me more about this promotion. Tell me everything. Well, I totally wasn't expecting it. They offered it to me out of nowhere. They? - Jack. - Ah-ha. Your little work crush. Easy. Easy. No. Timing's a little tough, though. - Why? - Mm, Felix. But he has been working on his consulting business, which is great. But we've both been so busy. We just... We haven't had the time to get on the same page. - You know? - Yeah, I bet. You know how he can be. But I am proud of him that he picked himself up during a time like this. I don't know. He seems like he's been a little... off. Hmm. Jim said he saw him downtown today. He said he seemed really happy. - Not today. - Yeah. Keeping up? Yes, I am. Keep going. Just up ahead. Isn't it beautiful, huh? Wow. I'm coming. I'm coming. Don't worry. You be careful. Wow. Look at you. We're almost there. It's just over the bridge. Is it worth it? Yes. I just... I know. Oh, Jesus. Hi. Hello? Hey. Hey. Did I wake you? Yeah, I was... Oh, my God. I haven't slept past 9:00 in ages. I know. I'm impressed. I know. What's up? I thought you might have been working. I will be. What's going on? Uh, I just wanted you to know that I'm going straight to McNamara's after work. They pushed a meeting, so I won't be able to come home first. What time are we meeting Grace and Ben there? Seven. All right, I'll see you then. - Okay. - Bye-bye. Bye. Hey. Did you see Diane's email? Yes. Pushed to 5:30. Right. Also, I was thinking sushi today, if you still want to get lunch. I'm buying. We could eat in my office? - That sounds good. - Perfect. I know you're watching me. I can't help it. What are you doing? What? You. Me? You're just so... Incredible? I had no idea. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just, uh... I don't know, I'm scared. You're discovering something you didn't know about yourself and now you're realizing it. I'm scared of losing what I have. But now I realize I don't have to. You have a new perspective. I do. When I'm with you, I see things differently. Rose-tinted? Yes. And I realize that the world isn't rose-tinted, but now I have options. Right? Right. I'm back. Any messages? Thank you. Perfect. Seriously, I mean it. Having you involved makes all the difference. Thank you. And the transition just seemed so natural. - Right? - I know. It's like... It's like I barely need you at all anymore. No, no, no. This is a partnership. We are a winning team, you and I. Do you usually wear contacts? Oh, uh, no. Those... Those are Auggie glasses. I don't know what that is. Really? Uh, well, they're interesting. Not for everyone. Um... Why don't you try them on? Okay. Oh, my God! What the hell is that? Oh, not a fan, huh? No, it's like there's two of you. Uh, it's a projection of a companion. A friend of mine let me borrow them. I'm sorry, I-I-I didn't mean to freak you out. No, no, no. It's okay, it's okay. It's just so strange. Do you have little conversations with yourself? Actually, uh, it projects what your subconscious wants to see. Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed. - No. Hey, don't be. It's fine. - You know what? I'm going to go back to my office. It's okay. I'm going to go. - Uh, no. I'll get it. - Excuse me. Yeah. That's great. Goddamn it, you idiot. Shit. Oh shit. Shit, shit. Honey. Honey, I'm on my way, okay? Yeah, I overslept. I'm so sorry. What? Oh, no. Oh Christ, how is she? All right, w-w-where? Okay, I'm... Oh, goddamn it, I'm so sorry. I'll be right there. Annie, where's Grace? I'm sorry. I overslept and my alarm didn't go off. - Where's Grace? - She's with Ben. - They're running some tests. - How is she doing? - Oh, hey, Dad. - Oh, baby. - How are you doing? - Hey. - How are you? - We're okay. He has a slight concussion. We have to keep an eye on him. - I just hit my head pretty hard. - Oh, honey. No, I'm... It's okay. Can't say the same about the car, though. - Why, what happened? - We got T-boned. But really, we're both okay. I just feel like I'm in shock. Okay, I got to go call my mom back. She's going insane. Yeah. Where were you? I was just napping, and I overslept, and the phone was on silent. - And I'm sorry. - It's okay. Well, as long as you're okay. Here, honey, I'll take care of this. Thanks, Dad. Okay. Honey? I could have driven them home. - It's fine. - I feel terrible. What do you want me to say? Nothing. Nothing, I don't know. Nothing. Nothing. Your hair was wet. What? At the clinic, you had just showered. I told you, I was getting ready for dinner. And the other day? Downtown? What? I don't even want to say it. You're wrong. - Am I? - Yes. What else should I think, Felix? Just, please tell me outright. Is there? What? - Someone else? - No! What else do you want me to say? I'm... I'm telling you the truth! I don't know where you're getting these things from. Okay. Fine. Sorry. It's been a long day. Good night, Felix. I'm sorry. Oh, it's not your fault. It's partly my fault. Is she okay? Yeah, she'll be fine. She has every reason to be mad. It's like I can't do anything right. You're seeing the world differently, but that's okay. We'll figure it out. Maybe you need a distraction. A new project. What do you mean? Come on. What are you doing? Surveying. What? Okay, grab these chairs and bring them over here. We're going to need bedsheets, pillows, and also... Oh. Okay. Hey, this is Felix. Please leave me a message. Oh, my God, I love you. I love you too. Oh, my God. - Honey! Honey! Honey! - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Honey, please. No, no, no. - Let me explain. - No, no, Felix. - I know what this is. - It's not what you think. - I swear to God, honey... - Felix, no! Enough! Goddamn it! Honey... I am so stupid. - Please, I don't... - You know what? I hope that this makes you feel very happy. Honey? Anne? Anne? Anne? Anne. Anne, just... Annie, listen to me. Honey, it's nothing! I'm telling you, it's nothing! Listen to me. Honey, just hear me out for a minute. Anne? Annie, just listen to me for a second. Just hear me out. Who do you see when you wear them? Hey, are you okay? I don't know. We don't have to talk about it unless you want to. I don't know what I want. That's okay. You know, sometimes it's hard to make sense of these things. How would you know? Life isn't easy. Is that so? Let me ask you something. Do you feel anything? Maybe we should go for a walk and cool down. I told you, I don't... I don't want to go for a walk. - I don't know what I want. - I understand. No, you don't. How could you? Honest to God, you're not helping. What can I do? I don't know. Goddamn it. Hi, you've reached Anne. I'm sorry I missed your call, but I will get back to you as soon as I can. Anne, I... I don't know what to say. Just, uh... Please just call me back, okay? I'm... Okay, bye-bye. Hey. Hey. Hi. How are you doing? How's Ben? So... Dad? Can you stop? Talk to me. You look like shit. Fair enough. Mom is really hurt. - I know. - She's staying at Kosha's. - Good. - No. Not good. You should go be with her. Honey, I don't think she wants to see me right now. Whose fault is that? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? You messed up. Look, it's not that simple, honey. I mean, there's... I'm going through something right now. Yeah, you're sneaking around like a fucking creep. - All right, that's enough. - No, it's true. You have no idea what it's like. You wake up in the morning and nothing. You don't need me. Your mother doesn't need me. And work? I'm nothing. I used to have value. I-I was... I had purpose. Now I don't know what to do with myself, huh? So... So, what do I do? You tell me. What about when you showed up an hour after Mom at the hospital? - What about it? - You were taking a nap? - I was. - Stop lying. You are so selfish. Maybe I am. - Hey. - Hey. I'm sorry about earlier. It's all right. Is Grace going to be okay? Yeah, I think so. I really screwed up. That's not true. Yes, it is. Nobody is perfect. I never expected any of this. Me neither. But it'll work itself out. I crossed the line. They'll forgive you. I wouldn't. And I got to tell you, I really miss Anne. Hey. - Hold on, what is...? - You can apologize to me. Anne? I know that you're confused. But you know that I love you and Grace loves you. You're a good man, Felix. You're doing your best. We all make mistakes. I'm sorry that I've been pushing you away. Oh, God, I'm supposed to be apologizing to you. I'm sorry. I'm here for you. We both are. No, you're not. Felix? Hi, you've reached Anne. I'm sorry I missed your call, but I will get back to you as soon as I can. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry. I thought I was in control. I wasn't. It's hard to explain. I tried them on. - You did? - Mm-hmm. Jack had a pair. And? I don't know. I wore them for, like, ten seconds. I didn't buy them for myself. They were a gift. I don't care where you got them, Felix. I just... Do you have sex with it? I have a conversation with it, okay? It's like a figure. This hologram, okay? And I... I can talk to her, okay? I can trust her, because... But you can't trust me? Is that where we're at? No, no, no, of course. Of course, I do. No, it's... It's easier. - It's difficult to explain. - Felix. I choose every single day to be married to you. And I'm going to be honest with you. I don't always want to be. It's not easy. But it is my choice. This thing, I'm sure that it listens, and it is supportive and agreeable, but it is not real. This, right here, this is real. Okay. I'll work harder. I will. I want you. I'll be better. Okay? - Hello! - You smell like an airplane. You need to... Oh, my parents are here. - Hey, honey. - Hold on one second. Hello, guys. Hi, Mom. Oh, hello! Mom, look who I have for you. Oh! Eve! Oh, my gosh! - Felix, you remember Eve. - Hey. Oh, Eve. Are you okay? She just came back. She just came back from college... - Okay, I love you. - I will text you about tomorrow. Yes, don't forget. - Have fun. - Okay. I love you. See you. Bye-bye. Oh, God. I think it is beautiful in here. You two have done a lovely job. Well, thank you. I am just grateful that Ben hasn't exploded. I have no idea what she's talking about. I love furniture shopping. You should have seen him when we tried to buy a bookshelf. I thought he was going to have an aneurysm. You know who is the worst when it comes to furniture? - Your father. - Really? Do you know that dresser that was in your old room? Do you ever wonder why it just tilts like that? - Oh, my God. Why? - Your father... So we bought it flat-pack. He put it together. He got so... frustrated, so infuriated... Oh, my God! Well done, Dad. Dad? Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry, I must have zoned out. - You okay? - Mm-hmm. Do you guys want to stay afterwards and, like, watch a movie or something? Yeah. - Great. - I would love it. - Sounds great. - Mm, what should we watch? You coming up? No. I'm going to call Graciella, return a few emails. It's pretty late. I know. I'll be up soon. Okay. I love you. And I love you.
