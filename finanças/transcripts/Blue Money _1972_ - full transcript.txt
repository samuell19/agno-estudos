(laughs) I had to change three 20s. Yes, yeah? Oh hello, how are you? = Had a nice trip? = My car is waiting outside, boys. = How bout a drink? = Never before five. = That's right. = Which hand boys, which hand? = Oh man, do we have to go through that schtick every time? = Left. = It's always nice doing business with my boys out here. = Hey wait a minute, there's only two thou here. = Two thou? = Now I don't want you boys walking around with that juice in your pockets. There are terrible people in the streets. = Yeah well what about the another one. One more. = Yeah, the deal was for three thou. Fire is down below. Three for a print, right? = Things are a little tight now, the economy. = Things were a little tight last time. They're getting a little tight for us too, you know. Tightness doesn't seem to be confined to one place. We're the top producers of this stuff on the coast, we don't have to do business like this. = You boys are the top producers, so far- Nice seeing you again, I have a plane to make. = Terrific, I thought you had it worked out with him. = That son of a bitch bandit. What can I say? = Yeah, did you get the feeling he wasn't appreciate of our art? (water running) = Went bad, huh? = We won't be able to put down the down payment on the diesel. Fatman came into town and ripped us off. So we just concentrate on getting the deck finished, it'll be okay. = Mike's super producer- I thought you said he was gonna talk to the guy this time. Want some dinner? = Huh? = Want some dinner? = No, I just wanna get some sleep. I hassled with shooting all this dude can come through and wanted to retake and. = I'm gonna have to come down and visit that set. = And there was some busts up in San Francisco. = Busts? = Yeah but it'll pass. It'll pass, right? Yeah. = Any chance of it coming down here? = I don't think so. Hey what are you thinking== = But you don't know. = Well. You ready to sail the sea? How is she today? = She was good. Listen, I don't want any trouble with the police. = No chance. = I just wanna get away with you. Stretch out the good days until that's all there are. Today at Ellen, I actually heard back from the fabric place. She got a call to go out in a commercial. They wanted mothers with babies so we talked about me going out and getting back into the acting thing. Only I don't have any desire anymore. I just wanna say goodbye all over the place. = Yeah, well, it wouldn't be so bad if you did do a couple commercials once in a while. It would mean more money towards the ship. If the opportunity is there. = But we already decided that I wouldn't, I mean, that it was all over- = Right but... = Well you didn't want me to but if you want me to now, I will. = Okay, forget it. Cut the light, will you please? I'm tired. (giggling) Turn on the light, I want to see what I'm doing. = You don't need a light. = Hand me a clean rag, love. = Hey, honey, take a break.

The islands, the blue water, so clear you can see thousands of inconceivably beautiful fish. We'll trade cod for our coconuts, you know. Going from one island to another- Sometimes we'll just drop anchor in a lagoon and bask in the sun all day. = Nude. = Nude. And just get high. I mean, high on the beauty and the freedom and on weed. We're going to be free. We're going to be free. = You know, it's so nice on your days off. It's like, we used to be like this. = I'm like how I was. I mean, like we were, there hasn't been any changes going on. = You know what I mean. It's like, there's sort of, a dead space emanating at times when you work. = Well, I have to go back to work tomorrow. And so I'll be the way I am these days, so you can dislike me. = You know, it's funny. We always get like this the day before you go back to the studio. Changes of moods. = You don't need to intellectualize your feelings, Liz. Get angry about it, don't hold it in. = Okay, I'm angry. On a scale of 1 00, you go down to 98. = You don't hate passionately, you're engulfed with love. = Yes, isn't it serious? = Terrible, engulfing love. = I'm gonna come down to the studio and spy on you. I'm gonna see what they do to transform you. I'll bring you lunch. = I don't want you to come down there, love. It is not Disneyland. = Hey, the things you say to me sometimes are really weird. The way you look at me is so weird. Sometimes, sometimes I feel like pouring this wine right over your head. (moaning) (heavy breathing) (moaning) = I'm making it. = Make it before the tape goes. (moaning) = I'm making it. I'm making it. = Oh merde, cut, cut it. = What, what? = Excellent. = Thank you Marty. Elaine, Elaine, why didn't you tell me? I mean, you cannot come to work having your period. = You have my apologies. = Oh you little cunt. = We could turn it into a period piece. (yelling) = It's alright, we can use her for simulation. I'll put out a few calls. = I cannot believe this thing. = Hi. = What are you doing here? = I, well, here I am. And you're right, it's no Disneyland here. = Yeah, well, we're kind of hassled here, so. Take off, love, okay? Excuse me. Okay, let's get this area cleaned up. Where the hell is Mary? = Hi, how'd it go in there? Did you get a good fuck? = Michelle? Hi baby. This is Michael. Wake you? Look, make my day for me, will you? I'd like you to do some work for me. Oh, two days worth, maybe. What? Jim? = Huh? = You cast that other chick yet? = I'm interviewing some people this afternoon. = Well Mickey's got a girlfriend down from Big Sur- What? She's got good acting experience. (laughing) = Alright, pipe it down. = Well you get her down to the office. About an hour- See you. Bye, babe. = Okay, Mary. You're a society girl who's looking for a job. So you've just come back from your analyst, who has practiced shock therapy on you by suddenly exposing himself. So a three gets going and, well you know the rest of the action. = What? Rest of the action? Are you supposed the psychiatrist? = My old lady and me, we saw your hype in the free press, man. You know, I'm really interested in getting into some good bread. And I'm amiable, can you dig it? My old lady here, she really gives good head. You wanna try her, man? = You won't believe this. = Incredible. = I told you. = Girls have a bored look. They really turn guys on. They look at me, they say, she's bored. They really get turned on by it. = Fine. We'll call you. = But when I climax, I don't look bored. I go through the most fantastic expression changes. When I climax, I'm a different person altogether- = [Jim] Right, I can tell. Thank you very much. (knocking) = Hi. = Hi Michelle. = See, this is Ingrid. I came prepared. = [Mike] Michelle, you are beautiful. = Hi. = Hi. = [Michelle] Say, is this another one of those loops? = Oh no, this one has a story. Go over the story with her, Mike. = [Mike] This is an office scene. We do some balling on a desk. = Yeah, go over the story with me Mike. = You're from Big Sur? = All over- Originally from Europe. (speaking French) = You ever done anything like this before? = No, I'm a virgin. = Hairspray, you use hairspray. = You don't like girls who use hairspray? = Yeah. = The real Ingrid. = Beautiful. And you pull that one and they'll be another one underneath that and another one underneath that, right? Then you come all apart and disappear- I get the message, I get the picture. = I've been down here for awhile. Thought I'd get myself some work down here. My old man is trying to find work. He's a musician. Anyway, I hope you're not going to have me fill out an application. One place, I fill out a form, where it says, place of last employment, I put, Screw Films Corporation. And that owl did a real straight, you know, he just about had a coronary. And this was at a Bank ofAmerica. They had just been bombed about a week before so everybody was real uptight. I'm going to make a collage out of these questioners. So, when do I start working? = Oh, I'll have to check out the schedule. = Sure, tomorrow's okay. Ready to go? = I'll let you know, okay? = Hey, I'm really good. Oh, I almost forgot, here's some pictures. = Bye Michelle. Ingrid. You wanna use her? She looks great. = She's beautiful. She has a sensitivity, there's something there with her- = Uh oh. Do I detect a new look to you, Jim? Yes, I believe you're actually thinking about balling that chick. Finally it's happened. How bout a drink? The Quebec separatist is about to separate. My God. Well, you just let father Michael here tell you about life. I mean, it's okay, don't feel guilty. After a couple years of marriage, well, you've talked about everything you'll ever talk about. Nothing new is going to change, no matter what your dreams are. In short, there's a deadness to the whole thing. = When you get married, send me the program. Have a good day, Mary. = Ingrid's really down. You're not gonna use her for anything are you? She really needs the money. = Yeah but what about her old man? Can't she get any money from him? = Who Johnny? = Yeah, the guy in camper she showed me the pictures of him. = Are you kidding? That shmuck? He lets her wash his socks once a month with her money. = [Surveillance] Surveillance report 281 , suspect seen in the company of an identified female Caucasian. Both parties are engaged in conversation outside photographic studio at 1 71 4 Walter Place. Suspect driving off. Female suspect reentering premisice (phone ringing) = I'll get it. Hello? Just a minute. It's for you, it's a girl. = Yeah? Hey look, how did you get this number? It's one of the models looking for some work. = I don't like her calling here. = How'd you get this number, Ingrid? = I went through a lot of trouble getting it. Don't be mad. = I'm not mad. = Look, I'd really like to get into some work right now. = I have to be straight with you, I don't relish the idea of seeing ball some guy from money. I just think you can do better than that. = You're very nice. Was that your wife who answered the phone? = Look Ingrid I== = I'm sorry. I just need the money really badly. I don't mind the work. It's less than nothing to me. = Come down to the set in the morning, I'll see what I can do. = Thanks. = Right. (heavy breathing) (moaning) = Thanks man. = Good job, Bill. How bout a ride home? = Sure. = Jim. = Let's go to a motel. = I'd like that. (soft musi) = Hey, not bad. A little bit plastic, but not bad. Even the soap is covered and the glasses have monogrammed sterilized baggies. And the toilet seat has necessary sanitized covering. = Yeah well, here have some wine, Ingrid. = Thank you. Oh wow. Look at all these postcards. = The guy that plants those in motel rooms monograms the baggies and sterilized glasses. It's all a plot. = Yeah, right. Do you mind if I write these cards to some friends? I've got some people up North. I'll be with you in a moment. (shower running) = Hey you coming in here? Come on. (screams) = Oh man, you're crazy. = You said you like taking showers together- = Oh wow man. Oh man. = You're beautiful. = Oh man, this is too much. = I'm so sorry about your clothes. Come on, let's get you dried up. (soft musi) = Hi. = Hi. Sorry I'm late. = The back of your neck is wet. = I stopped off at Mike's and took a shower- = Oh. = Good night. = [Lisa] Good night. = Look at this, love. It's beginning to look like the Hollywood Freeway at five o'clock. What a bloody shame. = Hey! I've been on the phone trying to get you two all morning. I even dared to go down to the boat yard. Did you read about the president's magnificent commission that came out last night? Good for us. = I thought you two were together last night? = Yeah, it came out on the late news, after you left, Jim. I'm having a party at my place later on. Got some crazy engineering people I'd like you to meet. Typical philistines, I'm trying to get some juice out of them for my feature. Some loose juice. = Okay, we'll come up. = Now these philistines don't know what we do for money, Jim. They think we're on a news team. They're the most incredible pseudo types. = Go if you want, love. I'd have to get a sitter, you know. = What's the matter? = [Lisa] Nothing. = Leave her with your neighbor across the street. Come on, Lis. How can you people ride around all day in the sun? It's very damaging to the skin. On second thought. Miss, I've just arrived in town and am homeless. = Eat it, Jack. = Promises, promises. = Celebration of the liberation of the porno film. Sounds great. I'll change. = You want a scotch? = No thanks, I have to go, I'm meeting this chick. = Banana. Rape. (laughs) = Harry, don't do those bananas. Always playing the clown. Michael's script is very immediate. Harry loves it. It has a nice quality. People are turning back to lightness. Quote Charles Champlin, LA Times. Lisa, would you like another drink? = No, no thanks. (jazz musi) = Listen, you and Jim have to come over- Every Friday night, we have slides and we get stoned. = You want my onion? It ruins my mouthwash. = Well. = Half of Charlie and Harry's office at systems get stoned. Stoned systems. (laughs) You'd never know they make fragmentation grenades. Vietnam by the gram. = Here let me. = How you doing? Bout ready to go? = Oh no, I'm doing very good now. = Yeah, well I can see that. I'm about finished with these people. Let's go home and go to bed. I mean, I'm just about to say something here. = It's hard to perceive you and Mike are straights. = Oh god yes, straights, that's right. (laughs) = Well that's funny. Here's Mike celebrating the president's commission, coming out for pornography. = Oh when I met her last night, she come to say mama and dada. = That commission is, it has a sense of reality. It's unbelievable they would but it's about time because I like pornography, it turns me on. = You like it huh? See you didn't do it. = Yeah but don't you think pornography's damaging, especially to young minds. I think it's an indication of the subsurface decay of our society. = You really believe that? You don't believe that. = But, what would you do, for instance, if you daughter were to make pornographic films? Would you like people to pay money to see her up there, on a widescreen? = Well if I had a daughter and if it were her thing, well it depends on how you raise your-- = I might not mind watching that. = Oh fine. You'd like to see her with some guy, maybe two or three guys, socking it to her- Beautiful. = Maybe you're right. = Ah yes, but nobody forces anybody to work in those movies. It's freedom of choice. And after all, you know, it's not that bad, people making love, you know, bodies mingling together- Some of those films are really well made. I know a couple of guys that have integrity in their work. = It's not love, it's an abuse of the human body. There's no feeling, there's no love. = I don't know where I stand. = It's all shit. Don't you see? There's nothing, there's absolutely nothing. = Hey love, love? I was just kidding. Hey. = Let's go home now, okay? Let's go home. I don't know why you had to keep going on like that. = How do you feel? = Games, there are games going on with those people. = Right. = Right and all those things are happening to you. Oh shit, I lost my necklace. = You're completely stoned. = What was the whole pretense about, I know a couple of guys? I mean, why didn't you just come out and tell those people what you did. = Because it's our private life. = Oh yeah, our life. = You were really serious with those people. You really were. You didn't say anything about it when I started making those films. = I didn't know. = Well you're eating off of it, love. And you drive a car off of the money, we're building a boat off of the money. = You've gotten so, into a completely indifferent thing. It's== = I know, I know, it's deadspace. Alright, let's go back to the way it was a couple of years ago in that crummy one room Hollywood apartment and driving that beat up VW and playing games, the games of the deeply happy street people actors and eating a lot of rice and potatoes and fighting the phone company because they kept shutting off the god damn service. = No, we're trapped. Well maybe I could save us some money. I mean, why don't you put me in one of your movies? I was gonna be a good actress once. I can move my butt around. How's this for a beaver shot. = Oh. You're completely stoned. = Well, come on. You could put our daughter in it eventually, I mean, keep it in the family. = Shut up. You god damn don't like it then let's forget the boat. Look at us. What are we doing here? What are we fighting about? = What's a matter? Don't you like me to get angry? I don't feel too good. I'm gonna go next door and get the baby. = [Tv] And now, our late news recap. This afternoon, the sheriff's department conducted surprise raids on several theaters showing alleged hardcore pornographic films. Some managers and several patrons were taken into custody and the films were confiscated. Also in the news, President Nixon's new economic program was revealed today. = Sorry, no go Mike. = It's three, it's three big ones, Freddy. = I tell you two of my place got the bust. The pigs came in and bust wide open two places for me. A customer had a heart attack and the insurance is after me. I come to you and I say with all my friendship and say, Mike we do business and you know I'm good for it. But I don't got no prints. What about you replace the prints the pigs took? = No replacements, Freddy. You want the new stuff or not? = Two grand only. = He must be the Fatman's brother, Mike. I tell you, they've got to be brothers. = Well, what you want Freddy to do? You know me, I don't rip nobody but those pigs, nobody protect Freddy. = Alright, okay, forget it. = Oh, I need to tell you. No black girl in here? = No. = Good. I don't want no more. They go over no good for me in Florida. It's a region of preference. Thank you Mike. Jim. = [Mike] Let's go down to the lab and pick up those new negatives and print. = Why not? = They just left, just now. = What's going on with this bust? What good did the commissions ruling do us? This is beautiful, we're getting fried. And they took all the negatives? Every single one of them? = Took 'em, they took everything. It's election time, the politicians want everybody to think they're doing a good job taking care of business. = What about the vault? = That's the first place they went. I should have known to open up Benny's van line and transfer the stuff the minute they started fixing the streets in the neighborhood. As it is, I'm getting an injunction now so they'll have to give the stuff back. = Let us know if and when, Benny, huh? = You've got my word. = Okay. = Too bad we can't sell our fingers. = I think we better sit out for a couple of weeks. = Yeah, two weeks. = Just until things get glued back around here. I'll call the crew. = Sure. = Benny will get the stuff back. We'll go from there. Besides, two weeks R and R won't hurt you, my man. = [Surveillance] Surveillance report 281 , suspect and accomplice, male Caucasian, file 282, in conversation outside film laboratory where raid was conducted on 920. Accomplish and subject leaving separately. = Now of course you stand a chance at getting busted on a 311 and Nixon coming out against the commission didn't exactly produce cries of ecstasy in some corners. The courts throw out most of the cases. Only thing is, you gotta have a lot of money stuffed away because they put you up against the wall and they clean you out through harassment and setting high bails, all that. = Well what do you think Chris? = Have you got the negatives and prints back from the lab? = It's such a random thing. The business may go on for some time. And then everything gets busted wide open. Then everything cools off. There's no form, no reason to it. You take your chances gentlemen, however, I will handle your cases. = [Jim] I say let's go on with it. = Jim, I wanted you to hear that, about the hassle and the money right from Chris. You've got nothing stacked away. You've got everything in that barge. = Well that's my problem anyway, you've got everything in that feature. = Yeah but, I'm covered. I'm getting some backing from those philistines. I worry about you. = Well I worry about you too, what are they getting? 50, 60 percent of your film? Nobody can take anything, any percent of my boat. = Yeah but if we get busted, no percent of nothing is nothing== = Look, I don't wanna hear those negative feelings, it won't happen to us. Look, I wanna get it finished and goodbye. Okay, action. Oh moans and groans, action, real loud. (moaning) Okay Ingrid, get in the shot. Maria, more expressions. = I'm picking you up on sound. = Okay Dave, hold it now, Dave. Okay Ingrid, move to her, touch her, move in for a kiss. = Hey you're on the soundtrack too much, man. = Watch your levels asshole, that's your job. = Alright, alright, cut, cut-= = What? = Look it's been a full day. It's getting too hassled around here. = Larry, this is the ultimate, this is fine. But don't come back tomorrow, okay Michael'll give you some bread. Wrap it up. Tomorrow morning nine o'clock, none of that usual 9:30 routine, okay? = [All] Okay. = You have some time? I'd like to talk to you. = I'm going down to my boat. (engine roaring) = Hello? Wow. = Hi. = What's happening with you? - What are you doing here? = I haven't had a chance to talk to you these days. This is too much. = I'm not gonna ask you how you found this place. = I guess it was a one time deal with us then. We have our own scenes, right? = Yes. (phone ringing) = Hello? No he's not Mike. Well he's probably down at the boat. = Can you get to him quick? I'll be at home. Have him call me. = Okay, bye. = What do you do? I mean, what is it made of, wood? = It's a fairly new process, it's called ferrocement. = Cement? How can it float? = It floats. It better float because I've put over a year and a half of my life into it. (birds chirping) = Tell me where you are going in this cement ship. Give me like the 1 0 cent tour- = The tour, huh? Well, there's a hell of a lot out here. Hi love. Had a good day? = I came down to the boat. I said I came down to the boat to tell you Mike called. That was the girl, right? = What? She's a model. You mean at the boat? = She's very beautiful, I can see how you'd enjoy balling her- = Now wait a minute, Liz. = I said I can see how you would. = I haven't been balling that girl. = There's only one girl around here you haven't been balling. I suppose there have been other times with these models of yours, right? = Oh that's what you've been carrying around. You've actually been== = How many other times? = No other times. = Come on, Jim. = Why are you fantasizing? You're jealous of some poor pathetic girl around whom you're building a fantasy. = Oh come off it. Stop turning around to where it's my problem. You're the one that's balling her, not me. = What do you want from me? The girl needs somebody to talk to, she's just a poor screwed up little-- = Okay Freud. What are you we gonna do about this, huh? What are we gonna do? = About what? What is going on? Alright, I've been balling her- You want me to say I've made it with her, okay. Is that what you want, fine. Right on. = I'll tell you what I want. I want you to quit making these films for Mike. Yeah, I would be happy to go back a year, a year and a half ago, away from the rip offs, the possibility of being busted and everything coming apart, away from the way you are now. = Look, it isn't this fast. It isn't this grand. What's going on? Can't you give me a little help? Things are tough now but, look, we're still very close, Liz, we're very close. = Jim, we are so close to nothing. (knocks) Christ, where have you been? = Go outside, Mike. = They busted Joe Gilano's. = Wait outside, will you? = They busted Gilano? Oh god. Now you can quit. Now it's all over, it has to be, it's too close. = Stop acting like a middle class bitch. You better make your mind up about what you want. Look, a couple more films and we're clear- = Maybe I have to get straight. I mean, maybe. Okay, I just can't do it here, I've got to go away. I'll take the baby. What if something happens? What if you get busted? We're going to Ellen's, I just can't think straight now, love. = Love, I didn't mean saying that. Look, a few more films and we're free. You're freaking over nothing. Please Lisa. = The files. We have to pull the files. Close down the place. = Yeah, okay. = What happened? = Nothing. This thing, she'll be back. Let's go. (bongo musi) = Everything out? = Yeah. And this is a note for our land lady. Dr Mrs. Morrison, the present state of the economy has forced us into an austerity program. Hope we can do business again after the next presidential election. I'll leave it on the door- = Okay. = Wait. = What? = We can still use this place. I mean, cleaned up like this. = Oh. = Well, nobody can draw any conclusions from an empty office, an empty sound stage. Why should we have people come into our place man, we can still use this thing. Look, we are still safe. I mean, nobody can get to use if we're in locations like when we started. Let's go for broke, now, fast. = Look Jim, I'm a little different position now. = What you're a different position, you're in it with me. = I got the backing for my script. Papers just have to be signed, that's all. I have to step out is what I'm trying to say, be in the background, a silent partner maybe. I can't physically help you with what you want to do anymore. I have to step out. = Okay, okay. I can keep it together- I don't need you. There's still some good markets left. San Francisco, Hawaii. God damn it, Mike. I've got two third of a 50,000 dollar ship sitting there. I got a hull sitting there. = I have to step out. = Okay. Okay. = What can I say? = [Jim] Hi Michelle. = [Michelle] Hi Jim. = Okay no phone calls, nobody phones. It might have a tap on them. Go over to Joe's place, then we'll meet in Sear's parking lot and go to the location from there. I don't think anything could happen, won't take chances. = Sure, okay. = Bye. = Bye. (moaning) (bongo musi) = [Surveillance] Surveillance report 281 , suspect engaged in renting photographic equipment. = Who's that guy across the street? = What guy? = He's got a 1 6 board U and he's been taking pictures of us ever since you walked in. = What? Let me see that. = [Surveillance] Uh oh, we've been spotted. = Let me have that eclair for tomorrow, Jack. = Okay.

The deal is for two grand. I need two grand. = You boys are in trouble out here and I'll tell you something else. Pretty soon, we ain't gonna need you because we theater owners are gonna make our own films. You boys owe me there. = Get out. = You god damn kids. = Christ, I'm getting evicted. (engine roaring) (upbeat musi) (phone ringing) = [Jim] Hello? = Hi. = Hi Liz, hello love. = I just wanted to say hello. How are you? = [Jim] How are you? How's baby? = We're fine, we're both good. I've gotten myself straight. I miss you. I love you, I wanna come home. = I miss you too, love, I miss you. God, if you knew what happened to me in the last few days. I had a fight with one of the buyers, threw him out of the office and they're kicking everybody out of the boat yard. I don't know, it's been sold or something. I guess they got tired of seeing my face around there for a year and a half. Great list I'm giving you there, right? = Yeah. = The ship is sitting out in the water, at the Marina, yeah. It's unbelievable, it's pointed right out to sea. = Oh I'm coming down. = Look love, I've gotta tell you. I closed in everything on myself and I've set up shooting of the last couple of films at the house. Mike is out of it, it's just me now and it's the only way I can do it. I don't wanna involve you in that, love so you know, just wait a little bit okay. I'll do it quick, get it over with and then we'll just erase it. Look, we'll be together and everything that went before just won't exist. = [Lisa] What if the cops? = No, no way. Things are cooling down now. I'll tell you, you were right staying away but that ship is sitting out there and it has to be finished. = Okay. But I do love you and I miss you. And I'm sorry I left you. It was wrong, it was my fault. = No, don't say that, love. No, no, it's alright. = I shouldn't have left you like that because you needed me then. = Everything's alright, I know. = [Lisa] I was paranoid. = I know, I love you, I love you. (moaning and heavy breathing) (dramatic musi) (bongo musi) (moaning) = Police officers, you're under arrest, everybody hold. = You got a warrant? = You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be held against you. You are entitled to legal council. = Nice try. We got so much film on you, it's just another grain on a beach full of sand. (bongo musi) = That's not your hair- = Pig. (police sirens) = You don't have to do that. You've been busting too many dopers and whores lately. They're real obscene pictures. Thanks for the sample. I suppose you have my phone bugged. Couple of guys following me. So tell me what you're doing with it, I'd be glad to save my garbage for you. = One count of indecent exposure, resisting arrest, conspiracy to commit oral copulation destruction of evidence. Oh don't worry, you'll get off. They'll never convict you, you've got the courts on your side, you'll go through fast like prunes. = Then what's the point? Why waste tax payer's money? = Because, we wanna get you back in line. Back in line with the average guy. You're gonna stay in line too. Oh this is gonna cost you plenty DeSalle Bail, lawyers, appeals. It's gonna cost you other things too, DeSalle You're always gonna be looking over your shoulder because we might be back there checking on you. You see, we don't think guys like you that deal in obscenities contribute anything to the community. = Well I've got news for you, it's the community that comes to see what I do. Nobody forces them. Nobody grabs them and throw them in a car and then strong arm them into a theater- The only obscene thing is this proceeding. = Alright, can he go now lieutenant? = Take off. We'll be watching your ass, DeSalle = Well watch me, okay? I certainly wouldn't want to frustrate your compulsion to invade privacy. Watch me in the middle of the ocean because that's where I'm gonna be. Me, my wife and my kid. Away from the average guy who lets people like you control him. Free from getting back in line. I don't like officials loaded over me. Your menu sucks. = Get out of here, DeSalle And stay on dry land so you can make your arranment, okay? (upbeat musi) = You know, love, here I was, going through all the money grubbing assholes, behaving just like the people that cop wanted me to be like, that is being in line. The whole thing is so ironic. (upbeat folk musi) It's gonna take some time but I promise you this, we'll get what we want, love. We'll make it, we'll get the boat finished and it'll be like the beginning of our real life, out there on the seven seas and all the bad time will have never existed at all. (upbeat folk musi)
