I am coming for you. The moment we come face to face... will be the last thing you remember. I am coming for you. Hello... Hello, who's this? - The moment we come face to face... - Hello. Who is this? Will be the last thing you remember. What nonsense? In Chennai, the director of the famous SR Hospitals, Mr. Salim Rahman, has been missing since the day before yesterday. His father, Ali Rahman, has lodged a complaint with the police. Welcome, Father. Have a seat. What happened, Father? You looked fine when you went in. But after coming out, you look like something is bothering you. Well... Vetri... I can't even smoke peacefully. Hello. What do you want? Sir, we've found a car in Padappai forest... With loads of money in it? No, sir, there's a corpse in it. I knew it! This is such a huge city, and out of all the places such crimes take place in my jurisdiction to make my life hell! Listen! I am already at the mortuary regarding another case. For now, complete all the basic formalities there. I'll reach there by then. This job sucks! - Good morning, sir. - Greetings. - Sir! - Greetings. Is he asleep, or is that a corpse? Done? Are you doing research using the corpse? Sir, our job is even more difficult. Got it. Are you drunk? Once dead, the stench is all that is left. And we need something like booze to beat that stench. - Sir, don't tell madam about it. - Don't worry. I won't. Drinking to work with dedication... can only be found in this profession. Ew! I wonder how they even work here. Hello... Yes, sir? Where is Bhadra ma'am? - Madam's over there. - Where? Damn! So many corpses! Moving to the next corpse? Where is she? What is she up to? Ma'am... Good morning. Michael... join me. Would you like a bite? You talk as if I bumped into you at a restaurant. Even if I go 10 days without food, I won't eat here. Once you realise your destiny is to work here, on the 11th day, you will start eating here. 11 days? I can't even stand here for 10 minutes! Listen, this case will get over in some time. Okay, ma'am. - Ma'am... - Hey! Why is there no water? Summer is here, ma'am. Water problems have started. Here, ma'am. People alive are struggling to get some water. Then how will the dead ones get? Am I right, Michael? Spot on, ma'am. - I'm here to discuss a case with... - Hey! Not there! Two inches below! - Another case? Already? - Yes, ma'am. We already have eight autopsies pending. And we didn't get any requisitions. I know, ma'am. If you can come in person and deal with it, then it'll make our investigation easy. Am I right? To the crime scene? So that's why you were running behind me? Fine, where? Padappai, inside a forest. It's all the same stench. I am unable to run back and forth. Please help. Fine. Let me complete this case. Thank you, ma'am. So, Michael, what was this girl's case? It's a missing case, ma'am. She left a note and eloped with her boyfriend. Two days after the complaint was lodged, her body was found in the well. Please investigate this case thoroughly. This is section 376-D. What do you mean? Gang rape and murder? Yes. Vaginal contusions, abnormal hymen tear. Excuse me, ma'am? This girl's reproductive organ is heavily damaged. In the name of love, many guys let their friends also have fun. Arrest and third degree isn't enough, but... Sorry, ma'am. I've collected the semen traces. You can do a DNA test and match to find out how many of them and who. Then decide how you'll punish them. Madam, shall we pack this body? How old are you? 25, madam. She is five years younger than you. Just like you, she must have had many dreams. After completing the formalities, while handing her body over to her parents, she must look better than you. - Got it? - Okay, madam. Fine, pack the body. Okay, Michael. Let's start. - Let's go, ma'am. - Yes. So, that's what it means to "stink like a corpse." Michael... - let me get my phone. You carry on. - Okay, ma'am. - Ma'am, your phone. - Okay. Thanks. Ameer, who saw it first and informed the police? Sir, a few women who were here to collect logs saw it first. - Any information on the car? - No, it's completely burnt. We have sent the engine details to the forensic guys. Okay. Is this the only way to reach here? Yes, madam. It's surrounded by the forest. - Where is the car? - This way. Please come, ma'am. What the hell? Go search over there. Over there... - Michael... - Ma'am? This is definitely section 302. He was murdered somewhere else. Then his corpse was brought here and burnt. How do you say that, ma'am? The victim hasn't tried to escape. Look. The seat belt is still intact on the buckle. Not just that. In three to four parts of his body, the bones seem to be broken. Ma'am... can we identify the victim through a DNA test? There's no flesh left. Even bone marrow test looks impossible. Based on the current temperature of the car... around... five to six hours ago, the car and the victim were set ablaze. They have used petrol. Can you give us anything else based on these details? Based on the bone structure, the victim is a man. Victim's height would be around 5 feet 8 inches. Around 33-35 years old. That's all. Madam... We found a petrol can. They have used petrol to burn the victim. Anything else? We have fingerprints. I'll give you further details later. - Shift the body to GH at once. - Okay, ma'am. We'll take care of the formalities tomorrow. Okay, ma'am. The corpse found yesterday is yet to be identified. In this situation, ACP Vishal... Hey! Cut it out! Look, come on! Sir, is it an accident or a murder? Sir, who do you think did this? - Sir, is it Salim Rahman's body? - Look here! Don't imagine things and cook up half-baked stories. Nothing is confirmed as yet. Is the police department hiding anything in this case? - Sir, just one more question! - Excuse me, sir! Please! When will you take action? Sir! - Are the formalities done? - It's in progress, sir. Welcome, Vishal. - Hi, Bhadra. - Hi. Is the final report ready? We just finished the autopsy. So, what's the autopsy outcome? I had told Michael earlier. - Yes, sir. - Section 302 confirmed. He was brutally tortured before he was murdered. Bones fractured in eight places. His spine is dislocated. For the spine to dislocate, he must have been hit using a heavy iron rod. Damage beyond identification. You said even DNA test is impossible. What is next, Bhadra? We have an option. Based on the measurements of this body, we can try the Super Imposition method. And, Vishal... all his right-hand fingers have been chopped off. That's unusual. Ma'am, they are a perfect match. Vishal, it's indeed Salim Rahman. Conclude it. Stop telling me about meat when I am at the mortuary. Hang up. - Sir, just a minute. - What? Look at this. Sir, what do we do? It's blown out of proportion. Our formalities are done. We can hand over the body immediately. - But... - Sir! Please check out the news. - What happened, Michael? - Ma'am, kindly turn on the TV. - Where's the remote? - Play the news channel. Vetri, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in Central Jail had told one of the prison staff, Raj end ran, that he will be murdering Dr. Salim Rahman. And he said it exactly on the day Dr. Salim Rahman went missing. We have received the audio and visual evidence. In the TikTok video by Raj end ran performed in Vetri's cell, the image of Salim Rahman can be seen on the wall. What's going on, Michael? Who is leaking such news to the press? Sir, I tried my best to keep it confidential. I'm not sure how it got leaked. I think this case is going to be a headache for you. Sir, that's Ali Rahman. Salim Rahman's father. Ma'am... Salim. Salim. This is unfair! Vetri, who is in prison, has claimed to have murdered Salim Rahman. Your comments, sir? This is a very sensitive case. Please don't disturb us, and let us do our duty. Sir, good afternoon. Who posted that TikTok video? Where is he? Raja, come here! Sir! Sorry, sir. Don't you know that cell phones aren't allowed inside the prison? - Don't you have sense? - I swear, no, sir. Sorry, sir. I mean... Did he have any visitors? Any relatives? I don't think he has any relatives, sir. So, nobody came to visit him? A church priest visits him quite often. He doesn't come to just visit him. He comes here to pray for all the prisoners here. During that time, he visits Vetri. The last time when he visited... Everybody confesses their crimes or sins to me after committing them. But he wanted forgiveness for the sins he is going to commit. He kept telling me that he wanted to murder someone. But today I could see it in his eyes. Where is he right now? What happened? The new inmates attacked him. Isn't this Dr. Salim Rahman? Why have you sketched his portrait here? That's your job. Go and find out. Stop looking at the floor and answer him! Michael! Paramasivam sir... Hand over the priest's details and Vetri's case files to Michael. Okay, sir. Come on, sir. What's the link between that convict and this case? Sir, I met that convict in prison. He's indeed behaving abnormally. I have filed a petition to get his custody. Just tell me who murdered my son. Rest... I know how to handle. You keep singing praises of some lady. Who was that? Dr. Bhadra Thangavel. - Ah! Yes. That girl. - A police surgeon. Many cases had a breakthrough after she got involved. She'd be very useful for our case. Okay, Vishal, I'll inform her. You please go and meet her. Yes, sir. Sir! Vishal, hold on. Bhadra is always hyped and eager to solve every case that she's assigned. Not just the case, but she'll give her best to expose everything related to the case. After all, she has a doctorate in Criminology. She will try to show off her capability. So, beware! Definitely, sir. I will. Diya... your principal seems to have only praises about you? That's Diya for you! Chatterbox! Fine... Your teacher told me that you wanted to become a cop. Is that true? Yes, Mommy. I am going to shoot down all the robbers. Wow! You know what? When I was a kid, even I wished to become a cop. Really? I read a lot of books that had cops and robbers. But your Grandpa Velu was hell-bent on making me a doctor. Then what happened? But... I was clever! I knew that I can be a doctor in the police department. And I joined there. A win-win for both Grandpa and Mommy! So, Mom, you are a cop? Yes! Salute! Thank you, ma'am. My brave girl. Bhadra... Hi! Come with me. Who is that uncle, Mom? Hi. - Your daughter? - Yes. Diya. - Hi, Diya. - Hi, uncle. My husband works in Dubai. - Okay. - Yeah. ADGP spoke to me. Okay. Why did you drag me into this case, Vishal? I was happy teaching my students and examining corpses. Higher officials' orders, Bhadra. I believe we can solve this case quickly with your help. Sure. Hopefully. Welcome to the team. Thank you. Stop repeating yourself! Well, the truth must be yelled out again and again here. Do you recognise him? He is asking you! Answer him! Speak! What is the issue between you two? Issue? There are no more issues. Didn't I murder him already? Sir... careful! He might just die. Leave him to me. I'll handle him. I very well know that you didn't murder him. Who's helping you from the outside? Answer me! God. Who is Angel? I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! He is just repeating the same thing, idiot! Who is Angel? Look at this graph. When you questioned him about Salim Rahman, it made him angry and he behaved in an impulsive manner. But the moment you took Angel's name, he reacted dead opposite to that. He went quiet. We need to know about Angel. A new twist in the Salim Rahman murder case. Vetri is now being escorted to this church. They are here. Come on! - Ameer! - Sir? Who is leaking information to the press? Good morning, Father. - Good morning. - I am ACP Vishal. - I had contacted you. - Tell me. - Ameer... - Sir? - Take Vetri to the cemetery. - Okay, sir. Can you tell us about Vetri, Father? If you want to know everything about Vetri, first, you must know about Angel. 25 years ago... that little angel... came in to our lives. It was me who named her Angel. Angel. She grew up in this church, among us. We were always filled with... her happiness and sorrows. What are you praying to Jesus in secret? Every student in my school has their dad's name as their surname. But I don't have a surname. Who said that? Who said you don't have a dad? Look there. He's a father to the whole world. From today, you'll be known as Angel Jesus. - Sounds good? - Okay. Well, on that note. Give me a candy. This is only for my dad. Come on, Dad. You don't answer any of your daughter's prayers. My friend Mary is getting married. She will then move to Chennai. I must rot here, riding this crappy bicycle. I don't have huge demands. Help me find my dream boy. All I want is to ride with him on a bike. And hug him tight as we go on a ride around these hills. That's all I ask. Well, there's no rush. Do it when you feel the time is right. I won't judge or misunderstand you. So embarrassing. Yes, sir? What do you want? So... that's your dad? Of course! So, you're bribing your dad? Yes, what's your problem? - What are you doing here, Vetri? - Father... - Done with your work? - Yes, Father. Father, will our prayers be answered if we pray in the church? Of course! Why do you ask? Nothing. Just curious. See you, Father. - Why do you look upset? - Nothing, Father. Okay, father, I'll carry on. ♪ My life has now turned colourful Thanks to you ♪ ♪ Loneliness was my friend All these days ♪ ♪ But now I am lost in your love ♪ Why did my mother abandon me, Father? - You're an angel. - Father... Come, Vetri. Tell me. Father, well... I like a girl. I think she also likes me. But... I don't know how to confess my love to her. Why confess to her? Meet her parents and ask for her hand in marriage. You think so, father? I... am in love with your daughter! I think she too loves me back. If you approve, then I shall... take care of her like an angel. Let me get this straight. I don't know why your mother abandoned you. But, until my last breath... I'll take good care of you. So, Angel... Father... Do you accept his proposal? What, Dad? What is it, Dad? Okay, I'll tell them. Father... my dad gave his approval. He's ordered us to get married soon. You naughty... ♪ Our hearts know We are now deep in love ♪ ♪ As our hearts fall in love As we speak the language of love ♪ ♪ I can experience A new kind of happiness in life ♪ ♪ You are all I think about There are many unsaid desires in me ♪ ♪ I wish I could love you All the time ♪ ♪ You are the only reason I live for ♪ ♪ I shall take care of you With all my heart ♪ ♪ Every tiny happiness you wish for ♪ ♪ I shall move worlds To make them happen ♪ ♪ All I wish for Is to be by your side forever ♪ ♪ I'll bring new life to this world We can call ours ♪ ♪ Whether I am by your side or not I will always live in your heart ♪ ♪ Our hearts know We are now deep in love ♪ Why are you both moving to Chennai suddenly, Vetri? I am not earning enough here, Father. Apart from that, we are going to have a child soon. So long I have lived a lonely life. But, every second of the rest of my life, I want my Angel by my side. That... That was the last time I saw him. Father... which hospital was Angel admitted in? JC Hospital. - Ameer. - Sir? - Take Vetri to the jeep. - Okay, sir. Move! I said move! Vetri... - I want to pray. - No way. Move! I said I want to pray! Ameer... he just wants to pray. Let him. Ameer. You may have forgiven those who crucified you. But me? My life didn't have a meaning. But with her love... she gave a beautiful meaning to my life. They denied me such a beautiful life! And those who ruined my life... must die! Vetri! So far what I've done... and what I am going to do... I have explained everything... to him. What? Cover this whole thing. Shoot it properly. - Make way! Move! - Quick! Shoot it! Sir, check this out. I have set the target... and now it's time to hunt. I am coming... for you. The moment we come face to face... will be the last thing you remember. IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF CAIN CAIN AND ABEL Sir, what does "In the footsteps of Cain" mean? It means... Our world's first murderer... Cain. In his greed for wealth, he murdered his own brother. "Henceforth, every murder committed in this world" "will be in the footsteps of Cain." That's how God cursed Cain. It's a story from the Bible. But... what's the link between that story and this case we're dealing with? I don't get it. Sir, it's done. Medical check-up is all cleared. Keep it in my cabin. Let's go. Bhadra, be careful. Don't hassle us. - Was it a murder attempt or accident? - I cannot confirm anything now. Michael, escort Vetri carefully. - Did Vetri say anything else? - Move! Make way! Michael! Please listen to us! Sir, what's your next move? - Please behave yourselves. - I can't confirm anything as of now. Sir, give us something. The inquiry is ongoing, so we can't confirm anything. Were they your men? I don't think so. Don't think you can confuse us and escape. I ain't confusing you. Didn't I already tell you... who I am going to kill next? Stop it if you can. What do you mean, Michael? Yes, ma'am. Four years ago, when Angel died, Salim was working at JC Hospital. Also, the file has Angel's autopsy report. What is it, Bhadra? Look who signed it. Salim Rahman. So? Michael, how did Angel die? In an accident. Cause of death? A blow to the back of the head. A woman... A pregnant woman... got a blow to her head and was admitted to the hospital for treatment. Who would examine her first? A surgeon... or a heart surgeon? There is something fishy in Angel's death that we are unaware of. But... we cannot come to a conclusion based on this autopsy report. Bhadra... can we... perform an autopsy again? Yes, we can! Sorry, ma'am. Sir, if we dig out her corpse after so long, do you think anything will be left? Maybe a few bones. Those may be useful only to occult practitioners. - Michael! - Sorry, sir. It's possible, Michael. Many cases have been solved using the bones that were found. But how, ma'am? In 1920... a pathologist named Sidney Smith. Using three bones found in a well, she found out that it belonged to a handicapped girl and reported to the police that the cause of death was a gunshot. During the police investigation, they found that it was the girl's father who murdered her. So, every small evidence we get might be of great help to us. Sorry, ma'am. All I need is a few of Angel's bones and I can come up with her complete history. Any of Vetri or Angel's relatives must file a case in court to re-examine her corpse. Only then we can perform an autopsy again. But they don't have any relatives. They do. According to CRPC section 176, the court allows to re-examine Angel Jesus' body. Are you blind? What are you staring at? Who is that? Didn't they find a better place? Father, wait here. You are causing a traffic jam! Take it somewhere else. Look at him! Watch out, you might fall and break your jaws! BLOOD DONATION CAMP So what? Move, I say! Move! I said leave! Too much! Leave! Make way! Move! Father? Father? - Michael. - Ma'am? How is Father's condition? His condition is a little serious. Any leads on who did it? We have given an order to track using CCTV footage. Sorry, sir. With Father in this condition, I don't think we can carry out the autopsy. The order will be cancelled. Things are out of our hands, Bhadra. It's all because of me, ma'am. Very sorry, ma'am. God! We can do it, Vishal. Once the sun rises and the first ray touches the land, as a forensic surgeon, I can carry out the autopsy. I have the right to do that. That's really good! Tomorrow morning, before the judge wakes up and goes to court, we shall finish that autopsy. We cannot take more risks with regards to Father. - Michael... - Sir? - Listen... - Vishal... before that, we have to take care of something. There you go, Vishal. Didn't I tell you they would come? Make sure Angel's body is safe. Hello, ma'am. - Am I late? - That's okay, ma'am. We are waiting for you to sign it. ♪ What is bothering you? ♪ ♪ What is bothering you? ♪ ♪ The flower and its fragrance Is now buried in soil ♪ ♪ The seed sown by the squirrel Is now a tree ♪ ♪ Even the sound of the dust Is now a melody ♪ ♪ The merciful land has faded away As it waited for you ♪ ♪ Don't you want to go? ♪ ♪ Or did you wait so long To bid goodbye? ♪ ♪ What is bothering you? ♪ ♪ What is bothering you? ♪ Angel's body, which was buried four years ago, has not decomposed. There is some mystery in this case. Why has the body not decomposed after so many years? Some supernatural phenomenon? The media are hyping up the whole thing. This is not any kind of supernatural phenomenon, Ameer. Some bodies are buried after being sealed in a concrete coffin. So, when sunlight and air cannot penetrate through, a wax-like texture forms all over their skin. Like soap. That will save their body from getting decomposed. It's called adipocere. It's very common. Vishal, this must remain between us. Keep it confidential. What's the matter, Bhadra? The autopsy that I performed now... is the first autopsy on Angel's body. What? The most important thing is that... from Angel's body, her heart is missing. Oh, God! The earlier autopsy report we have doesn't mention anything like that. Even the report that we got from JC Hospital doesn't mention that. Vishal... there is some serious crime hiding behind all this. Something extrajudicial. Madam! - Shall we bury the body back? - No, Ameer. The autopsy is not complete. We aren't done examining it. Make arrangements to shift this body to the GH. Okay, madam. Clear the crowd. I said clear off! Move! Make way! These keynotes are worthless! None of the details is complete in this report. Madam, I just joined here. These are old files. I need to talk to your dean. Where is he? I shall give you the address if you want. I am... I am not confusing you. Coming for you. Who I am going to murder next. The moment we come face to face... So far what I've done... and what I am going to do... I have explained everything... I have set the target... I have explained everything to him. Now it's time to hunt. ...will be the last thing you remember. Will be the last thing... Vishal. Yes, Bhadra? Guess who Vetri is going to murder next? Who? Didn't he talk about footsteps? "In the footsteps of Cain." Whom did Cain murder? His younger brother. His name is... Abel. Welcome, Vishal. How do you know my name, sir? Well, aren't you the current trending sensational news? Dr. Bhadra... The most brilliant pathologist in the Tamil Nadu police department. Thank you, sir. - Can we sit down? - Yes! Yes! Please sit down. Sir, looks like you read a lot. Yes, I love reading. "Thick As Thieves." By the time we finish this book, our minds too will start working like a thief. Isn't it, sir? Buy a pack of cigarettes for me. Okay, sir. I'm sorry. Some poison? No, sir. Thank you. Coffee, tea, anything? No, sir. So, do you stay alone? In fact, my family is in Australia. I stay here when I visit India. My business is here. That's the reason. Excuse me. Sir, let me come to the point. Four years ago, a woman died in your hospital. When we conducted an autopsy on her corpse again, we found that your hospital has committed a crime. We came here to collect details regarding that. Enough. I know where this discussion is heading. How well do you know Dr. Salim Rahman? He is one of the famous heart surgeons. We don't have to do organ trading to earn our livelihood. We never accused you of organ trading. Then how did you guess? Well... Well... that... Didn't you inquire about it in the hospital? But, Vishal... we never inquired about organ trading in the hospital. You'll have to come to our office tomorrow morning at 10:00. To ensure your safety, we are arranging security for you tonight. - Michael... - Sir? Call the control room and arrange four officers for the doctor's protection. Let this be confidential. Is this a house arrest? Let it be a secret between us. Control room. Please send in four officers from E-8 station. Sir... I forgot my phone. You're over thinking. Relax. Vishal... didn't he tell us that he's alone in the house? - Yes. - Nope. I feel someone else... Michael! Michael, how did they get in? Michael, come on! Kumar, the murderer is escaping! Catch him! Hey, Kumar! Constables, clear the media. - Ameer, be careful with these people. - Okay, sir. We can say anything only after the autopsy. Is there any police involvement in this case, ma'am? Ma'am, please answer us before you go. Why is the media getting wrong information? Please take care of it. Hold. Please have patience. There's too much pressure, Bhadra. Please finish the autopsy quickly. No, Vishal. I won't carry out this autopsy. Since I was also at the spot, there might be a backlash. So, I'll get my associate to do it. - But, Bhadra, only if you do... - Don't worry. I'll supervise it. Vetri was spot on about this murder. Which means he definitely has an ally on the outside. No thanks, Bhadra. I have some work at my office. - I'll see you later. - Okay, fine. Sir! - ADGP is waiting, sir. - What? When did he arrive? Just now, sir. Did you get anything useful from the other guy? He isn't a common criminal who will fall for our threats. We must interrogate him the way we know best. Just give me permission... and inch by inch of third-degree treatment will make him speak. - Fine, try your luck. - Thank you, sir. Sir! What's going on, Vishal? There is no progress! I've to come up with new excuses to convince the Home Minister. Let me know if you want me to transfer this case to someone else. Sir, no! We are very close. Salim Rahman, Abel... We have got the same fingerprints at both crime scenes. We thought Father Lourdusamy was helping Vetri. But someone tried to murder him. That's the culprit we are after. The fellow you caught at the cemetery... - Yes, sir? - Did you get anything from him? Sir, we are interrogating him. Definitely by this evening we will get something. Sir, we must take Vetri into custody once again. With your permission. This guy is definitely not human! Sir... What happened, Michael? My hands have gone numb beating him up. No matter how much we torture him, he's pointing to Royapuram Mani. Who is that Mani? Arrest him at once! That's a dangerous locality, sir. It's not easy to walk in there as a policeman and arrest him. We'll be ripped apart. Look at this doofus! Pees only in this spot. Okay, we are ready. Dinesh, don't get caught. Okay, see you tomorrow then. Okay, see you. See you. Any update on the stuff? Well, Shekar keeps buying the stuff from us, but he refuses to pay. Don't worry. I'll deal with him. Sir, ready. Ready. Who's bursting crackers in here? How dare you? Waste disposal! Waste disposal! Waste disposal! You already took Vetri in your custody and carried out an investigation. Then why do you need five more days of custody? Salim Rahman and Abel. The fingerprints found at both crime scenes are the same. Apart from these two autopsies, when we re-examined Vetri's wife Angel's body, we found that JC Hospital is involved in a serious crime. The correct evidence is in this file. What do you mean, Bhadra? A medical crime? Yes, ma'am. The court approves to hand over Vetri's custody to the police for two days and investigate. Thank you, ma'am. My Lord, with your permission, can I ask Vetri something? Yes. Proceed. Does your journey stop here... or will it continue? The secret that the people or the media don't know... you presented it before the judge. Angel. The person who received Angel's heart... is the one who I going for next. Look here, Mani! The sooner you tell the truth, the better for you. No one's coming to bail you out from here. - Sir! Sir, it hurts! - This interrogation is off the record. Speak! Sir, I'll tell you! I'll tell you everything! Whoa! So many tests. I am exhausted. Looks like we'll need separate income for childbirth. We could have gone to some small hospital. You're my angel... and so is our child. Our births weren't memorable birth. But our baby angel must take birth in a rich place. All our fears will vanish after her birth, and there will be happiness in your eyes. Well, all the money spent for that is worth it! What happened? She is kicking me. I think she's telling me not to make daddy spend too much. - She's not kicking you... - ♪ You are the one Who bore my loneliness ♪ but patting you to stay calm. ♪ You are the one Who bore my loneliness ♪ ♪ I was a dry plant in the desert ♪ ♪ But you turned me Into a colourful flower ♪ ♪ Like a peacock getting exited At the sight of rain ♪ ♪ I get excited At the sight of you ♪ ♪ Come, let's fall deep in love ♪ ♪ Like a peacock getting exited At the sight of rain ♪ ♪ I get excited At the sight of you ♪ ♪ Come, let's fall deep in love ♪ Get up! Get up! Ravi, come on! Run! Run! Angel's heart was transplanted. We found out only now. It is a fact not even in the hospital records. But how did you know, Vetri? Did Father tell you? Who would help this orphan, Father? God is the saviour of hurt souls. That God has now arrived to help you. Your prayers are going to be answered. All you have to do is follow my instructions while you're in prison. Sir, I met that convict in prison. He kept telling me that he wanted to murder someone. Speak! Isn't this Dr. Salim Rahman? Why have you sketched his portrait here? But today I could see it in his eyes. That's your job. Go and find out. I very well know you didn't kill him. Who's helping you from the outside? He was brutally tortured before he was murdered. God! He was murdered somewhere else. Then his corpse was brought here and burnt. I have set the target. I've already told you. He's indeed behaving abnormally. Who I am going to murder next. Rest everything will fall in place. Now it's time to hunt. When we were conducting the autopsy on Angel's body, even Father was in the ICU. So, apart from Father, someone else is helping him. And that person is the killer. He's someone among us who is working for Vetri. Dad, I have prepared the food. So, eat well and then go play with the corpses. Why do you have to be so rude? Dad... after Mom passed away, you are all we got. You shouldn't starve and spoil your health. It hurts us to see you like this. Ain't I earning now? Why can't you retire and take care of your health? She's asking, "Aren't you getting late for work?" I can understand what she's telling. Okay, take care of him. See you. Bye. Oh! Sorry! Sorry! See you, Dad. Priya, how many times do I call you? Why don't you pick up my calls? Oh, no! My mobile was on silent. I didn't notice. I got repeated calls from my son's school. Looks like he is very sick. Oh, my God! - Can you do me a favour? - Tell me. I have duty in the operation theatre this evening. Can you fill in for me, please? Is it? Who is the duty doctor? Dear, what happened? Look at me. Why are you crying? Priya, look at me. Dad... do the lives of poor people mean nothing in the world of the rich? What do you mean? I filled in for that nurse and went to the surgery room. Since Dr. Salim was going to perform the surgery, I didn't know the patient's details. But once I went in... I understood that... something wrong was about to happen there. Angel was in a condition where she could've been saved. But instead of saving her... the doctor proceeded with the surgery. She was pregnant, Dad. They took out the child, but the child was dead. Such premature dead babies are handed to us. What the hell? What are we going to do, Dad? I am not saying this just for Angel. If such an injustice has happened to a girl, then it definitely must be brought to the attention of the authorities. What? One more death. If we can make Ali spit out the truth, then all this will come to an end. But that's impossible. It's not just Ali. There are three others who know about this. Vetri... the killer... and the one who is going to die next. July 26th, 2017. That's the day Angel met with an accident. And death on the same day. The heart has a speciality. For transplanting, it must be removed when the donor is alive and transplanted to the recipient within four hours. So, the recipient had their transplantation surgery on the same day. July 26th. In that case, that surgery must have taken place in JC Hospital or somewhere nearby. Yes. But we don't have access to those records. So, let's alert the public. Those who had done heart transplantation on that date is the next target of the killer. Not many transplant surgeries can take place in one day. Yes. So, what next? A new twist to the Angel murder case. On 26th July 2017, those who underwent heart transplants in Chennai are asked to come forward and meet the police. Sir, why am I being transferred? For excelling in your duty! This case has been transferred to CB CID. You may leave. Leave, son. Son... shall I tell you something? I am the one behind all this. What was that girl's name? Ah! Angel! Her heart fetched us ₹2 crore. Today its value will be even more. My son's murderer should have met his maker back then. So, you were behind all that? The only evidence you have got is Mani. I know what his statement will be when he appears in court. The one who got Angel's heart is of course the next target. We can nab the killer based on this. I'll tell you who received Angel's heart. Sounds good? Correct, sir. Money can do wonders. Do you think Vetri's next target is the recipient? But I feel... that his next target... is you. Complete all the formalities from our end and release Angel's body. Okay, ma'am. Told you, Vishal. They just won't let us work. That's our system for you. It feels incomplete to leave the case halfway. Another murder will definitely take place. No, Bhadra... Whoever is the recipient of Angel's heart... Vetri will not murder them. You know... Vetri's motive is to bring the truth out in the open. And for that Vetri or the killer has manipulated us. But... all these murders have a justification. Everyone who died deserved it. Who do you think is going to die next? I am coming for you. The moment we come face to face... will be the last thing you remember. So it was you? You murdered my son? Spare me and I shall pay you loads of money. Please let me go. The punishment for every sin and its execution is in the hands of God. The corpses that we receive are unnatural death and MLC, medico-legal cases. Hope you guys know. Each of them will be in different conditions. For example... we have received this body that was under water for three days. The skin of such corpses... will skin out as a whole. Suppose... if a criminal gets their hands on this, they can misuse these fingerprints. Apart from that, if this is preserved in formalin solution, it will stay intact for however long we want. So, we must handle such cases very carefully. Okay? I shall give you old autopsy files. Study them and ask me if you have any doubts. Mr. Kaali, please get those old autopsy files. H5. Burns. BD. Give me that. This girl... Were you the one who attended this case? You guys may leave. Hand it over to them. Kaali... I know this girl. I've started, Vetri. I'm about to board the bus. Okay? Shall I disconnect the call? I'll reach... Are you nuts? Come on, girl! Can't you find a safe place to talk? - Sorry. Sorry. - To hell with your sorry. Fine. Move to a safer place. Careful. Excuse me. Wow! You too are travelling on this bus! Would you like a chocolate? It's okay. Have a bite. I don't eat chocolates. "Sita." So, where are you from? Chennai. I'll get down before you. At Poonamallee. Well, I am Angel. I didn't ask. Well, I volunteered. And you are? Bhadra. Bhadra! Fine. Let's get to know each other. I am Angel, and I am from Valparai. You rushed out so fast. Are you that hungry? - One coffee, please. - Okay. Do you want one? I'm done. Are you always so hyped up... and talkative? Well... guess what? This life took me on a long journey. A journey without any happiness. For 22 years, I was all by myself. I shared my emotions with myself. I lived all by myself. Then, Vetri came into my life. And now... we are expecting our daughter soon. I am so happy! Vetri has given me all the happiness in this world, which I was missing. Do you want to hear your child's movements? How? Do you want or not? Yes! I would love to! Do you hear that? I do! What's your baby telling you? So, you're a doctor? Yes. Couldn't you guess? I swear I couldn't. So be it. Tomorrow is Vetri's birthday. I don't know what to gift him. What did Vetri gift you on your birthday? Nice. Why is this frame empty? Well, there is a reason behind it. What's that? I'll wear it only after I insert my daughter's photo on that side. - Where is Vetri? - He'll come. Give me the bag. - Are you sure? - It's okay, I'll take care. - Fine. Take care. - Come here. Bye. Call me. Do you have anything to tell me? The moment I realised the baby was alive, I didn't know what to do. Had I taken her back to the hospital, she would've definitely died. With whatever medical knowledge I have, I saved her life. The child will be safe here, Father. I am not saying this just for Angel. If such an injustice has happened to a girl, then it definitely must be brought to the attention of the authorities. It's not as easy as you think, Father. We cannot prove anything without evidence. But you can... get us the evidence, Priya. Me? But how, madam? JC Hospital server will definitely have Angel's treatment details. All you need to do is get that for me. I'll take care of the rest. Madam, that's a huge risk! Those details can be found only in Salim Rahman's personal computer. We must take this risk, Priya. Look at her plight. Imagine if it was you? That innocent kid deserves justice. Those criminals must answer to the law. - It's in your hands. - Madam... What if things go awry? Then my daughter's future... Madam... I will get you that evidence. She had an accident in the lab and acid spilt all over her. 80% of her body is damaged, madam. The chances of surviving are very low. It was just an accident, so we haven't informed the police... Please give us a minute. Okay, madam. Come on. What is it, Priya? Yes, tell me. This wasn't an accident? Relax. It's okay. It's okay. You'll be fine. I'll ensure that, Priya. - Welcome, madam. - Hi, Priya. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing great. So, you read these books. Right from childhood, I love books. Very good. Finished reading this book? I've just started reading it. Have you read about this author? No. Jean-Dominique, the author of this book. He was completely paralysed. That's shocking, madam! Then how did he write this book? He was completely paralysed after getting a stroke. He could move only one of his eyes. Actually, the person who gave him his speech therapy helped him write this book. How? She'd write down the letters on a board and point to them one by one. So, when she'd point to the letter Jean wanted, he would blink his eye. Wait! Priya... Dad, I have prepared the food. So, eat well and then go play with the corpses. It was you. You made her do this. You made her do this. You... That girl... That poor girl... I killed her! I killed her! Everybody said that I committed suicide! But you proved that it was murder. Where is the guy who murdered me? In prison, or is he still free? I didn't die due to stomach pain. Eight men raped and murdered me. You found that out. Did they get punished? Everybody said that I died in an accident. But you found out that I was beaten to death. Did law and order punish my killer? Or did God punish my killer? Answer me! Answer us! Answer us... Ma'am? Ma'am! Ma'am? We don't have the right to punish sinners. Only God has the right to punish them. In order to punish sinners, we can be God's weapons and that's not a sin, Father. But who gets to do that among us... must be chosen by God. In Angel's case... God has chosen... us! You must do me a favour. You must pass the information I give you to Vetri. Who would help this orphan, Father? But the fact that we are behind all this must be kept a secret from Vetri. God is the saviour for hurt souls. That God has now arrived to help you. Father, will our prayers be answered if we pray in church? Of course! Your prayers are going to be answered. All you have to do is follow my instructions while you're in prison. I very well know that you didn't kill him. Who's helping you from the outside? God! Rest everything will just fall in place. He was brutally tortured before murdering. What do you want? I can give you anything! Please! I don't want anything. But you see him? You owe him an explanation. You can't bring me to justice with the data you took from my computer. Why indulge in such unnecessary social service? Her heart fetched us ₹2 crore. She had a rare blood group, AB negative. You are useless to me. Guys, let her go. You may leave, dear. For 35 years, he was strong every time during any autopsy. I have performed many autopsies. And now? You have made me perform it on my daughter! These last four years, every time a girl's body is sent for autopsy, he breaks down remembering his daughter. He is still waiting for justice. He deserves a judgement! Bones fractured in eight places. In this whole world... the first ever autopsy to be performed on a living human... will be you! He was murdered somewhere else. Use petrol and set him ablaze in the car, in some forest. Then his corpse was brought here and burnt. I forgot my phone. Vishal... didn't he tell us that he's alone in the house? I feel someone else... The skin of such corpses will skin out as a whole. If a criminal gets their hands on this, they can misuse these fingerprints. Throw the petrol can nearby... with fingerprints. They have used petrol to set the victim ablaze. We have fingerprints. The police will go only after this fingerprint. Salim Rahman, Abel... We have got the same fingerprints at both crime scenes. As far as the fingerprints are concerned, only we know who it belongs to. I am not saying this just for Angel. If such an injustice has happened to a girl, then it definitely must be brought to the attention of the authorities. Vetri's motive is to bring the truth out in the open. And for that... Vetri or the killer has manipulated us. This life took me on a long journey. A journey without any happiness. For 22 years, I was all by myself. I shared my emotions with myself. I lived all by myself. Then, Vetri came into my life. So long I have lived a lonely life. But every second of the rest of my life, I want my Angel by my side. ♪ Like peacock getting exited At the sight of rain ♪ ♪ I get excited At the sight of you ♪ ♪ Come, let's fall deep in love ♪ ♪ Like peacock getting exited At the sight of rain ♪ ♪ I get excited At the sight of you ♪ ♪ Come, let's fall deep in love ♪ Sir! I'd like to talk to Vetri privately. Vetri... everyone you wanted to punish... has been punished by someone else through God. Just a few more days, right? Just leave behind all this vengeance... and come out of prison. God... took away everything from me. Here, this Munch chocolate is for you. No, you have it. She has a gift for you. Why is this frame empty? Well, there is a reason behind it. What's that? I'll wear it only after I insert my daughter's photo on that side. What's happening? Haven't you started yet? Is this all the respect you show to the cadaver? Cadaver? Who's that, ma'am? Let me explain. The corpse that is useful to medical students in the study of human anatomy. Some orphan corpses sent from the mortuary or donated corpses for medical services are called cadavers. Sometimes... some people are useless while they are alive but are useful after dying, right? That's what it is. So, that's the story of all cadavers. Don't make them wait and disrespect them. Go on. Proceed to your first anatomy class. Yes, ma'am. Breaking news on the Salim Rahman murder case. Salim Rahman's father is now missing since two days. As per reports, the fingerprints found belong to a Bihar resident. It is suspected that the murderer may have kidnapped Ali Rahman and taken him to Bihar. The police are on their way to Bihar now to nab the killer.
