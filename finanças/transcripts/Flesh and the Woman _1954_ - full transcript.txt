What's with you? - Nothing. What are you angry at me for? - Nothing. Why do you keep saying "nothing"? - Because I've nothing to say to you. I'll explain tomorrow. I needed to get back early. So come back. Bury your nose in your paperwork, and I'll watch you with your nose in your paperwork. That will be lovely. It's a client. Your clients have been annoying me all day. And if it's necessary that they also take up the night and this evening... This evening? Oh, Sylvia, I'd forgotten! Our second anniversary. I am ungrateful, a wretch. A man, in other words. They always forget everything. It's a sign. The proof that I no longer love you? Say it, if you dare. The year ahead... - Yes, I'm already there. I have to beg you? Don't say anything, that would be better. You'll never forgive me? - Never. You should have remembered. It's too late. You must forgive me. Sylvia, you are wrong! Happy anniversary! Quiet! I'm not one for speeches, but for raising my glass, I'm unbeatable. Sylvia, Pierre, you make a stunning couple. We love you. Your health! You remembered! - How could I forget? You really had me fooled. You are all so kind. Do you all have a drink? I ask that you give Sylvia 5 minutes so she can get changed. Music! Bazi, take care of the food and drink. I'll be two minutes. I was the most unhappy woman in the world, and now I'm the happiest! I hope it stays that way - Which dress shall I put on? Guess. Pierre, you aren't being silly? I love you. I adore you. You have the necklace? - Yes. How much? - Three. You told me two. The other understood that you wanted it at once. You've given them my cheque? - After it's completed. That okay with you? It's blocked. Tomorrow, I'll see Walter. He's promised me the money. I haven't done wrong? - Sylvia will want this. You're taking more and more risks. I love her more and more. Whisky? - What for? I'm already drunk. In sir's office, there is a gentleman waiting for you. It's not the time to come here and annoy me. Xavier Noblet. A bad deal? The black market? - That's it. How did you get in? - With the guests. You could've waited until tomorrow. - No. The hearing may be in Lyon, but there are other matters and the dossier must be in Paris tomorrow. I wanted to indicate to you that the only piece available is registered under the number... We don't talk like this in front of a lawyer. I'm here on behalf of Francois Butard. He's told me how you can be an effective defender. He also has a boring piece that by some miracle got lost. The best moment to intervene would be when the dossier's in transit. Thus I wanted to bring you a reserve as soon as possible. Cash only? - I'm not a child. Have a seat. One million, 500... two millions... You'll stop me. It's for the first expenses. 500... You don't come cheap - I have collaborators. A word I don't much like. 600... 700... Pierre, it's midnight. Come back at 11am and bring the dossier. I have explained to you. Bring the pieces in a napkin. I'll think about it. Here's the door. Good evening. Sir. Madame. What did he want? - He wants a divorce. At this hour? Well, it's at night that we avoid going to jail. You are beautiful, Sylvia. - Oh, I'm happy. You're in that dress that I like best. You remember the first evening? I remember all the days, all the evenings. In two years, you've given me what I'll remember until my dying day. Take this, as my thank you. I think you are a little mad. You like it? With my final words, in the wretched bed I'll undoubetedly finish up in, I will remember this moment. The nape of your neck... And my eyes. - The most beautiful eyes in the world. And my mouth. Why did you say that you'd end your days in misery? Instinct, my character... This happiness is a miracle. And, you know, miracles... It's good, of course, that you love like a madman... but if we were more reasonable, if we were married... It would be different, and I don't want to change. Pierre, our guests... - I don't care. Your father is looking at us. - I don't care. Oh, Pierre, please! You're crazy, Pierre! Serious voice, formal appearance... You have a problem. Yes. Don't tell me. I hate bad news when I first wake up. I can sort it out. With me, everything can be sorted out. Only, this one's serious. - You really want to annoy me. The President of the Bar is demanding my resignation. Why's he starting up? What have you done wrong? You know who I defended. Well, to be effective, I had to be a little bit strong. Because of that man who came to see me at midnight... Mr Noblet got away to Barcelona. If the police bring him back, he'll tell all. I don't understand it at all. Only tell me if that's about to happen and it's getting very serious. I'm going by plane to Barcelona. I depart in 53 minutes. That Italian do is on Thursday. I won't be there? You know, for the moment... You can go to Barcelona and return in 48 hours. Pierre, I have an amazing dress, it's insane. And it's for you. Oh, come back. Be so kind. I'm going to make the best of my exile to have a look around Algeria. My stay down there could take several weeks, several months... Well... I'll remember this breakfast. What is it? Come in, Simone. They've brought madame's dress. I'll put on my robe. Pierre, take the tray. Pass me the robe. Shall I come and join you in Algeria? I've got you a ticket for the 18th. It's only the 3rd. What am I going to do in Paris alone? You have 15 days to liquidate everything. Liquidate what? The house, the jewels, the car... In other words, everything. Everything? Bazi will help you. He knows who owes me money and to whom I have debts. If I'm to wait on that... I hope it all comes good, if not it won't be because of me. You are so beautiful. Nothing is too good for you. I have no regrets. But there is something I must ask from you that embarrasses me greatly... the diamond necklace. It must be sold? No. It hasn't been paid for, it must be returned. It's a pity, but I'll give it back. Thank you. We'll be in difficulty for some time. Until then, we'll have to manage with the money you can bring. You're worried that I might think twice before following you, eh? With you, I've no worries about starting all over again. Even in a strange country, we'll be happy. It rains, you'll be there... It gets tough, you'll be there... The hardest part is these 15 days without you. I've changed my mind like a bird. This time in Paris will be very good. In Algeria, there will be good company, lovely villas. You'll see once I've arranged everything. I was going to cry, and now I wish we were going already. The 18th? I'm going to get dressed quickly for when you go. It will be my last time, so let's leave Paris in style. Do it while I phone Bazi. Come in. I want you to put on the most beautiful dress that ever came out of our house. Hello, Bazi? It's Pierre. I'm leaving for Barcelona, to Noblet's bolt hole. You know the reasons. I'll be gone a long time. At worst. Yes, Sylvia roughly knows the situation. It's necessary to dispose of everything quickly and disappear. You're sending me an SOS like it's a victory announcement. Do you realise the situation? Go on, everything's arranged. Thanks, old chum. The newspapers would like to photograph madame. An unforgettable image of you. And there is a cloak. We'll bring it this evening for sir. Oh, yes. - I have to go. You're not going to kiss me? I want to say "adieu". And the cloak, I can have it all the same? If you wish. Goodbye. The 18th? You're leaving too, madame? Excuse me, you've promised a cheque. Send me the bill, and I'll take care of it. Is madame aware that she owes 1,400,000F to the house? Is that the case? I did not realise. Don't worry, I'll sort it all out. The Paris plane has been announced? - In 15 minutes. And this storm? - It will entertain the passengers. A Perrier. Abandoned? His owner is in the washroom. Five years in the Legion, left yesterday. That must be celebrated. You're happy there? The plane announced was for where? Brazzaville They couldn't find somewhere else? Come on, my dog. Come. My dog. Adjutant... It's his name. Show the gentleman what you know how to do. Go on, do your thing! To the flag. Death to the enemy! There you go. Me, I'm a colonel, so when he's not clever I spank the arse of my Adjutant. Attention. - Free... I'm a lawyer. You are still under military authority. This could be costly for you. You kidding me? - No. My respects, colonel. But Adjutant, it's his name. Without that, I wouldn't have been allowed him. 5 years of the Legion, 5 years of sun. I don't want to see more sun, I don't want to see more kepis. Another for my lawyer. - Oh no. Oh yes! Where are you going? - Somewhere where there's always snow. Excuse me, I'm waiting for someone. She's pretty? Very pretty. No, forget about it... It was for the legal advice. Enjoy the snow. This is the Paris plane? - Yes. All the passengers are here? - Yes. Ms Sylvia Ricci? She's not on my list. - It's not possible. Excuse me. For Paris? - A few minutes. Get me Auteuil 9259, would you? How much does it cost? - 720F for three minutes. I have 900F. It's enough for 3 minutes. In the meantime, get me the Hotel Ambassadors. Booth No.1. Good, thank you. Ah yes, sir, there is a telegram. One moment, please. Do you want me to open it? Very good, sir. It's from Paris. Time: 1.27pm. 12 words. "Suicide attempt Xavier Noblet. Stop. Unhappily, not dead". The telegram is unsigned. Would you like it read again? Very good. At your service. The line is suspended. Suspended? Get me Jasmin 4028. A question, mister lawyer. If I said a small word to the colonel, how much could that cost me? I don't know. 20 years. - Thanks. It's not worth it. Booth No.1. Well, come on, old chap. Let's drink some more. Hello, Bazi? That you, Bazi? It's me, Pierre. Can you hear me, old pal? Can you hear me? No, miss, sir isn't here. I'm Gertrud, the housekeeper. Oh, it's Mr Martel? I took you for a young lady! They deceive us, these machines. I was talking. Don't interrupt. But you wanted to speak to sir? The gentlemen from the justice department came for him yesterday. It's in all the papers. Has Ms Sylvia left Paris? What? You don't know that either? Oh, the poor dear... Ah, she certainly didn't deserve that. She was so nice... Why have you cut me off? Are you mad? You only had three minutes. There are manners. I know only one: pull the plug. I give you my word that I will pay you later. We don't take credit - Take my watch. It's not a pawnshop here. The next plane for Paris? - Leaves at 11pm. I'll take a seat. Pierre Martel, Parisian lawyer. The ticket is 14,600F. I am at the Ambassadors, the concierge will pay you. The newspaper. The others. Everything you've received. Hey, you, lawyer! Your girl didn't arrive? - She must've missed the plane. Don't worry, she'll appear. I have a taxi. Come have a drink with me. Give me a cigarette. In Indochina, you needed radar in every ear. You heard, or you were dead. What are you looking for in those newspapers? I've got serious troubles. You've killed someone? - Nobody. - Well, it'll work out. Yes? She can come up in 5 minutes. It's a chick. Listen, Mario... Help me. I'd sleep on a mattress but, for the women, we need the trimmings. The Paris plane leaves in an hour. I'll be on it. You don't give the impression that you've often made a bed. Lend me 15,000F. - To go see your pretty girl? She must be caught up in my problems. If she's pretty, she'll get out of it easily enough. But pull on the sheets, for God's sake, and tuck in the corner. But, this girl, I love her and she loves me. That's the sort of reasoning that leads us into the arms of the police. To disappear, I must get to Paris. I have to pay for my seat. Give me a break! If you need a 1000F to eat, okay, but not a penny for your floozies. I know you think I'm a pain, but you're my last chance. You've said the word that touches me. To prove that I'm a friend I offer my bed, the girl with it and my pastis on top of that, so that you forget that aeroplane. I'm begging you, 15,000F. So you want my cash? You know how I won this, little fraud of a lawyer? With my sweat, with my blood, with my feet! Money like this, it's not for women! It's for the snow. Dare to touch it... Can I come in, darling? Dare to touch it and I'll give it to you. I'm telling you it's yours if you dare to take it. No kidding! Look. With a nose like this, what do you want of me? I have a social life, me. I have to go... I haven't got the time to hang around for a week like this. Don't cry. The other one... come here. Your name? What am I called? - Yes. I'm called Michaud, Pierre Michaud. Your papers? - They've been stolen. What were you doing there? - Looking for work. It was when you were looking for work that you busted up Madame? It wasn't my fault. - Let me tell you... Your gob! This is all that you have on you? - Yes. Take it, it's yours. It's not even 1,000F. You can take that... or file charges that'll drag on for 6 months. What a lovely evening! I'd rather donate it to the police benevolent fund. Goodbye. Are you finished with me? Listen, you don't have a penny, you aren't Michaud, and if you don't have papers, it's because you've burnt them. It's not quite like that. Men at the end of their tether, I can spot them. You, you're all washed up. If you're looking for a situation, an ideal, here. I'm going through a bad spell, but for the future, I'd like something better. THE LAST STEP. Madame Blanche... they're here. I know. - Of the 1,000, how much is left? 186. What a job, when you think of it! So be like the others, don't think. And don't move like that. It's too hot. You have nice hands. I'd never noticed them before. There are some who like well-kept hands. But those are my suitcases. And my pictures. You aren't showing me the door? It suits me that on their return, I need the room. I've been here 15 months, I have rights! Don't start shouting, it only raises the thermometer. They were gone four years, they've returned and you must go. Or they will move you. How long until they leave again, Madame Blanche? Here they are. They're here, madame. Madame Blanche, I'd rather leave you on good terms. And I'd like to leave you one of my paintings. One of the best. Choose. - They all look alike to me. It's your sixth. - I'd forgotten what they're like. There's as much as you want. Naturally, you're the last. We went the furthest. - If you knew where. We've spent 17 days crawling in the dirt. It's good for the stomach. Let's see your faces. You are handsome. Not a word for four years. - We thought about you a lot. And my pastis. You're thirsty? - Always. More and more. - For me, that's... I know. Half... half. And for you? - Straight. Mixing your drinks is bad for the liver. Fred, whisky. You remember everything. You're not having anything? It doesn't agree with me - Still on the pills? Like Mario, it's my liver. You seen his stripes? Sergeant? Delusions of grandeur? I was tired of the dirt, I climbed a piton and pissed on the enemy. He wasn't drunk. - And our dives? Your rooms are ready. Get a move on, the bus won't wait for you! There, it's always yours. - You've changed nothing. There's a bed and a washbasin, what do you want me to change? You've only time to change your shirt. Go in. After you. Say, I can smell paint. An artist was here for a while. - Nice? The types that come here because it's picturesque, for the sunsets... You've seen, above your basin? My favourite soap. How did you remember? - That... And my trunk? Here. You left it here in the open? - It was safe in my room. This's never left me. I remember exactly what's in there. I have lots of things. It's all that I have. No accidents? None at all. They're enjoying themselves down there. They eat as if they were at home. Hey, Pierre, you ready? What are you doing? - Nothing. You not going to town? - No. You know, you don't have to rush off and see the girls. Of course! Wait! Hey! You need anything? - I'll have a drink. Why aren't you going out partying? I want to drink, not party. That won't do you any good. Stop taking your pills and I'll stop drinking! Good. Aicha will bring what you need. Your accounts are improving? - No, madame. Leave it. Like that, it's easier. I should take a drink up to the sergeant? He's had enough to drink. Good night. - Good night. You received our telegram? - I know it by heart. "Starters, chateaubriand, cheeses and fruits... for 3 gentlemen and 3 ladies, Saturday 10th September at 10pm". It's five to ten. - It's all ready. You'll like it. Where are the ladies? - What can I offer you? We didn't come here for you. You don't change. And the third? Detained elsewhere. We'll eat his share and take care of his woman. So, where's it happening? For friends, there's a salon. Through here. Was it tough, down there? We aren't going to talk about that. - Ancient history, it's boring. What we're interested in is your birds. It's here. Good evening. - Good evening, dearie. Why's he your dearie? You're my dearie too. - Then we're in agreement. Where are your friends? - You bored with me already? They're making themselves beautiful. It's not right, you always having these headaches. Your doctor must be wrong. Maybe you have a bad tooth? It's not a tooth, it's my head. Take an aspirin. That'll help. You need to relax... they haven't come here to meet an overwrought woman. Here, drink this. I need a lie down. It won't be long before they're suggesting that to you. Mado, Helena, the officers are here. Officers! I hope there's one who's a corporal. What've you been doing? - Helene's not well. How are they? What they said was right: they're gentlemen. Shit. The upper classes aren't my speciality. Okay, let's go. Here we are! I'm Rose. She's Mado. And she's Helena. Gentlemen, I'm delighted by your kind invitation. So, should we decide right away how we're going to divide up? One minute. Mario? Is there one you prefer? - Yes. Me too. It may be the same one. - Maybe. So what do we do? - One solution: you give her up. I was just about to say the same to you. The thing to do is flip a coin. What are you two plotting? Pairing up is a serious thing. We're thinking it through. Excuse us, miss. What do you choose? - Heads. Pity. Miss Helena, if you would sit next to me. You other two with me. Have a seat. You, there. One will be my wife, and the other my mistress. The gentleman is a little pig! Ah, the starters! I'll help you. They weren't lying when they said you're an exceptional beauty. So they keep telling me. I also find you very nice. Why hasn't Aicha brought my drink? She must've forgot. You're defending her, eh? I swear. Go and make your own if you want. Read my cards. - You? You've done it for Fred. I know, he told me. Down there, at the worst times, he was clinging to his machine gun because you told him he'd die without a weapon in his hand. I don't do it for anyone now because I believe in it. It's different for me. What happens to me, I don't care. If you think I still care about anything... Sit down. Oh, you're kind. I'm going to kiss you. You stink of alcohol. Sit down. So, I should do "the great game"? Go for the great game! Cut. The other hand. I'm not scared. Tell me everything. At night, a postman. I'll be late for a journey. A letter from a legal man wishing me well. And in my thoughts, a blonde woman with blue eyes, faithful unto death. She's a redhead with brown eyes. But she will not follow you into misfortune. Where did you see that? - In the cards. She's at the centre of your thoughts. You loved her from the start, and you love her still. Bloody hell! Don't lie to me. If you want. I'll see her again? If you talk all the time... Yes, you'll see her again. - Where? She will come to you. You're saying that to make me happy. I see a time of happiness for you. A time of love. With her? It won't last a long time, but you'll see her again. Be careful of your health. I'm going to die soon? - No. You don't dare say it? Death is the 9 of spades and the 9 of diamonds. They aren't here. An annoyance. A serious annoyance. You will kill a man. It wouldn't be the first time. - No, not in service. This one... We'll see. How do you know about the redhead with the brown eyes? I haven't told anyone. Blanche... you want to see her? I have a little photo. Look. It's her. It's all gone. With time, with water, with the dirt... They've made her fade. But I... I remember her very well. Get out. A shot in the arm, a shot in the ass. Move yourselves. You're worried about our health? To make beautiful corpses, you must be healthy. You don't want to keep the noise down and be less of a rabble? Make a line, you know what that is? Silence! This is a hospital here, not one of your whorehouses. Get rid of the cigarettes. Sargeant, you need to learn how to lead a platoon. I said to get rid of the cigarettes! Including yours, sergeant. And now organise yourselves. In threes. And no shoving. Follow me. Forward. Miss... Sister... - What? The injections, do they hurt? Sylvia! You may not enter. Help me, guards! Help me, guards! Help me, the Legion! Help me, the Legion! This way! Stop them, come on! Don't let them out! You've been wandering about for long? - I must find her. Give us a description. She has these incredible eyes. You've never seen anything like them. She has two eyes, two arms, two legs. Why not tell us how many teeth she has left? Give it a rest. You understand nothing. Fred, you're a friend. I know she's here. You understand what this means to me? No. And I don't want to understand. There's something I must tell you. With this Sylvia of yours, we're starting to get right fed up. I'm here because of her. 4 years I've been thinking of her. Now I've seen her... I have the right to tell my friends. No. I want to know nothing. Not your miseries, not your secrets. We don't tell you ours. Joining the Legion, it's to wipe the slate clean. You coming with us to Carl's? No. We'll start without you - I don't care. We'll ask the captain to excuse you. - A baptism or a funeral?... You tell him... We'll tell him. I've done it enough times before. Bye. Bye. Sylvia! Can't you see she's fainted? She's blacked out. You might wait until she's conscious before feeling her up. Feeling better? - It's passed. You gave me quite a fright. At the hospital, they tried all sorts of things that didn't help. They told me to stop bothering them. They said I'm cured. You're lucky if they'll leave you in peace at last. I have to get going. I've got a date. What's he doing here? - He carried you up here. He refuses to leave. What does he want? What a question! Really! Do what you like. Sylvia, don't you recognise me? I'm not called Sylvia. I saw you at the hospital. Since then, I've been looking everywhere. When you saw me, you fainted. - It was hot in there. And I was drunk. My name's Helena. Look at me. You don't recognise me? No. I've been looking for you for a long time. I've been looking for nobody. Then why are you in Algeria? We always think things will be better somewhere else. Did you have money trouble? It was my lover. When things go badly, men are unfair. He accused me of spending too much. You bought dresses, jewels. You making fun of me? We had nothing. With no money, there's no love. So he left me. It's weird that you're interested. It's the same old story. And when he left, what did you do? I worked in the cafes. Then a truck hit me. You were in hospital for a long time? I saw nothing, sensed nothing. It happened in winter, and when I woke up it was summer. Why are you bothering me with all this? Come next to me, while I go to sleep. If you stay too long, you'll miss your truck back. Sylvia, to find you again like this... I must know what you want. I'm going to sleep. Say my name. Say it three times. Don't say anything else. But it's you who keeps asking me questions! And now you tell me to stop talking. Shut up. Those are your eyes. The most beautiful eyes in the world. And my mouth, you don't like it? I have some coffee and croissants. - I didn't ask for anything. I thought you might like them. - You owe me nothing. And all that you told me last night, it was some sort of joke? What did I say? - Some nice things. I don't remember. Your headaches must be contagious. I've lost all my memory as well. As you're here, you might as well drink your coffee. Pierre, will you come back? No. I've not done anything wrong. You're not like the others. I'd like to see you again. It's bad for me to look at you, to listen to you. It wasn't so bad for you to put your arms around me. If you don't like my voice, I can keep quiet. You spend all your nights in that club? I'll come back this evening, perhaps. I'll be there at 10pm. Wait for me. I'll wait for you. Pierre, before going, won't you say something kind? Thanks for the coffee. You not dancing? - No, I'm waiting for someone. In his place, I'd get my skates on. These guys I'm with would like to meet you. It's a tax collector and an inspector. I don't pay taxes. Your sergeant is messing with you. The Legion pass through, but they never return. I'll carry on waiting. And your room, how are you going to pay for it? Get off my back [in Italian]. I was going back to Carl's to see you. You're going to the barracks? - Yes. To ask for me? It's good to see you, but I'm looking for someone else. Oh, pity. You know a sergeant, slim, tall, called Pierre? Yes. He's been demoted... for a night on the town without permission. So, it was you, Sylvia? It was like that that he called on me. Obviously. A woman looking for a man when she doesn't even know his full name. It's much too good for me. Yes, I'm coming. What happened between us, it's forgotten. Mario won't say anything. Come on then. Where to? Can I trust you? - I think so. Come on. It's hot. It's that time of year. But it's hitting particularly hard. Talking about it isn't making it better. Yes. We'll still be perspiring. You don't? Yes, but I perspire in silence. Hey, Blanche, look. It's her. Who's that? - Sylvia. And it's me who found her. I've brought her to you. Put her in a cage, so she can't fly away. You've done well. This is Blanche. I don't have the time to explain. Blanche is Blanche. She'll entertain you. I heard! Here you ["vous"] won't miss anything. You're calling me "vous" now? I have no reason to call you by more familiar terms. Bye. Thanks. Until next time. Let's hope it'll be cooler then. So, you're Sylvia? My name's Helena. I haven't seen a girl like you around. Pierre is a little crazy, but he's not mad. You're thirsty? You hungry? I'm hot, and want to go to sleep. That's a sickness we can cure. Come. You've no luggage? I owe two months of rent. They wouldn't let me remove anything. Go up. There are some clothes of mine up there. Dresses I don't wear any more. I arrive like this, without a dress... without a penny... You don't even know who I am. I've learnt not to ask too many questions. I'll get some linen... a night-shirt. Why are you so kind? Why? Pierre, how do you find him? I like him very much. But sometimes, he's weird. There's no need to give me the story of your name. Nobody uses their real name here. And for a girl, how she's called... it matters less that if she's had a good rest and has a nice dress. All you have to do is choose. Often, when he looks at me, it makes me feel funny. He's in a dream. Some prefer to do that in silence. Others want to talk. With them, the main thing is not to annoy them. Which do you want? I like this colour. Who's that? - It's me, Pierre. They've let you out this evening? They couldn't wait until tomorrow? She's here? - You didn't get my message? Otto gave it to me. Where is she? For the last five days, she's been waiting up there. It was you who found her? How is she? You need us to tell you how she is? Thank you, Blanche. Thanks, old pal. I was in prison. I know. I couldn't get word to you. I found out. You're angry? If you're angry, I'm leaving. I didn't dare believe it. And even now... I'm not sure I do. It's really you? You? You! You think it'll work out between them? You haven't told me how you found her. Secrets, I can smell them, discover them. It would be funny to find someone for whom love brings them happiness. It doesn't remind me of anything. I'll explain it to you. I know what's happened. When I left, you learnt that we had nothing. They questioned you. It's that? They seized the house, the car, your jewelry, and you started to hate me. Afterwards, there was a gap. Things got tough. With the bad luck, the disgust... That's how it was, before the truck? That's how it was. I need you to remember. Our house in Paris, can you recall it? What could we see out of the bedroom window? Trees. You see, you can remember a little. And what colour was the car? Gray. - No. Think! Black. - Blue. Whose portrait was in my office? It seems... Christmas night in Megeve, our anniversary, where were we? You going to answer? - I don't want to. You're doing this on purpose, to torture me. It's your revenge for the cops, for the bailiffs. For two years, you've been plotting your revenge, without an angry word. You realise what you spent? Why didn't you come? Why didn't you write? Answer me! You're sick? Nothing forced me to come here. It wasn't out of curiosity. It's just... it made me happy. I'm alone, and you're alone. Why don't you want us to enjoy some happiness? Pierre, I promise that I will try not to annoy you. This is the most honest thing I've said for some time... I'm not Sylvia. Then what are you doing here? Get out. Get out! The balustrade is rotten. I don't want to see her again! Get her out of here. Here, get her a ticket. So she can disappear. Okay, that'll pay for the bus. If you don't change your mind. I think I'm going mad. - You're not alone in that view. It's not Sylvia. She's never been to Paris. She looks very much like her. She's the opposite of Sylvia. She's a drudge. She had you fooled. With those two, anyone would. Your girl lived in Paris, and she was rich. Some people won't bother you with their memories because they have little to tell. It's her, then it goes, then it returns. I ask questions, she makes a mess of the answers. Instead of talking, you should take her in your arms, make love in silence, and tomorrow, you fool, you won't want her to go. Stay. Who's there? It's me, Mario. The others are having a quiet siesta. But I can't sleep. I'm too hot. It's good here. I'm not bothering you? Just let me sleep. It's become good in here. A mirror... A woman in the house, and everything changes. You haven't got a sister for my place? I don't have a sister. Pity. Sleep. All the same it's a pity to have said heads instead of tails. If I can't sleep, it's because of you. Look at me. - Let go. It's disgusting. You swore to me. Vows to women, they don't count. Pierre's your friend. Yes. But when I found girls, he was not deprived. Mario, please. - Don't argue with me. It's no skin off your nose. Don't touch me. You're going to make a song and dance about it, at your age? Open! Open! It was open. She was on her bed, so I came in. You're leaving. I'm going to knock your block off. Don't get me angry, Pierre. We've always shared everything. The last cigarette and all the floozies. Pierre, they'll arrest you? - No, Mario won't say anything. Run to the barracks. Get some help. And you, quick, prepare a bed. Run! I predicted that you would kill a friend. There was nothing you could have done to stop it. It was inevitable. And now? - Leave it to me. They smoked for hours sitting on the balustrade. I kept telling them it was rotten. It was inevitable that an accident would happen. And the heaviest has fallen. What was that about smoking? Peacefully? Who pushed him? Who was fighting with him? With Michaud, because of your lodger? Captain, I don't have a lodger. If they were fighting, the strongest wouldn't be the one who fell. It was the balustrade, and of course his drinking. Stop lying. Don't try to save Michaud when the evidence is so against him. Then why ask me as a witness? I thought you were more clever. I also want to save Michaud. But not for the same reasons. Your dive will remain closed. I have my licence. I'm withdrawing it. For 6 months, a year... Madame, of all the corners of the world, how do they end up here? These men who've been beaten up by life? I exhaust them with marches, I ban them from fighting, so I thought. I gut them like rabbits. Only afterwards, I want to take them in hand and turn them into new men. And you, with your pastis, your fries, your music, you revive in them all I have destroyed. I'm a woman. I'm not a captain. Your dive is closed for 6 months. Your dive where the balustrade's not the only thing that's rotten. For Michaud, captain, my statement stands... or I should make another? Whether you give your testimony on oath or not, it's the same thing. Next. Someone's waiting for you outside. I'll be back shortly. Pierre, where are you going? Destination unknown. It's going to be dangerous? - Nobody knows anything. But don't worry any more, speak to Blanche. Look. They restored my stripes, just to keep my morale up. Don't fall into the trap. They've done that to stir you up to act like a madman, to set an example. Don't take useless risks. Do this for me. Helena, 3 months before the end, now that we are happy, that would be most stupid. It's true that you're happy? - I am cured. I want to live. I love you. Say that again. I love you, Helena. Listen. It's the call to assemble. I must go. I'm afraid. When they sound the call, I can't think of you. And if only one of us returns, I promise that it'll be me. Alive. Destination unknown. That doesn't sound good. But they like that, the general staff, to make us believe something terrible's up. Don't worry. If he doesn't come back, I'll die. There was a song like that. How many times I sang it... You were an artiste? Me? Finish your beans. I don't want them. You love him so much? Yes. And how long it's taken me. The nights with his questions. He made me ill. And made himself ill. And then when he finally explained I understood everything. I could tell like him. There are now some things... I think I'm starting to remember. The pretty blue car? No, but I know I could drive. That means I had a car. So, why mightn't it have been blue? It's funny. Now, he no longer talks of Sylvia. He has accepted that you are Helena? Sometimes. Other times, he doesn't know. Pass me a toothpick. Success in love, it's perhaps that: make believe for a long time that we are who they want us to be. To know if they will return, you would let me do the cards? That, never again. I don't want to know before anyone else. A serious epidemic is raging in your village. We have not come here to fight you, but to help you. To save everyone who is still living. Everyone will be evacuated after their treatment, and relocated to another village. Trust us. Leave your houses. Trust us. NCOs, line your troops up along the wall. Line up. To enter the village on a scouting mission, I need 20 volunteers. 9 men with Sergeant Gomez, 9 men with Sergeant Wilhem. A happy legionnaire is no longer a legionnaire. Don't be stupid. Blanche foresaw that I would die disarmed. I'm not taking a risk. Old pal. - Present. Koueknega? - Present. Follart? - Present. Titus? - Present. Gonzales? - Present. Fluch? - Present. And Vincent. - Present. Forward. We are not here to fight you, but to help you. To show this to you, the first men will advance unarmed. Stack your rifles. There's nothing else of his? That, and the empty bottles. You will burn his things? - Of course. Without looking at them? I'll open it and start the fire. His key. He always carried it around his neck. When he was dying, did he say anything? Something in German. He died quickly? No. A horse? His horse. He was called Tango. You knew about it? He never spoke of a woman, but he often thought of his horse. Pierre... when he was dying, what did he say? He said: "I wasn't a traitor". How did you know? Awake, he could keep quiet. But not in his sleep. Really? It's over. You want to take it? Thank you. Finished! Sergeant Michaud, remember him? He's gone. Let me introduce, Pierre Martel. No profession, but a serious boy with a bright future. I prefer you in your civvies. If I was dressed, then... Hey, sergeant! Poor bloke! Taking his turn. Now, a taxi! No, there's a direct tram. For 5 years, I've been obeying. Today, I give the orders. I have some errands to make. The ship leaves at 5pm. You have the time. While you're doing them, I'll be in the place I've dreamt about so much. Today, more than any other, I deserve that, don't I? Taxi? Palace Hotel. You're good? I feel like a millionaire, a billionaire. But how much is all this costing? - 1 month of soldiering or 2. There's no more champagne? There's still a little. We had to return to civvy street through a grand portal. This will be a happy memory. We were filthy, shabby, miserable types. I wanted to say to you once, in a proper room, with chandeliers, that I love you. Why are you dressed? I'm going to look for a new dress at 'Dames de France'. I will buy you others, and furs as well. No, I see 1000F in our account. If I blow it, that won't go well for us. You have your feet on the ground! You hold it against me? No, you're right. You are wise, organised. All that isn't very cheerful. You are my salvation. Now, that's better! Pierre, what are you doing? What time is the ship? What? - 5.05pm. Pierre! Pierre! I should get the tickets. Yes. - We'll collect them at the dock. Hurry up. Madame de Montessant. Madame de Montessant would be so kind as to wait. Thank you. - Thank you, madame. Is it really you? I'm happy to see you. It's been 4 years. 4 years with no news. Five. I never was one for counting. Pierre, have I changed? No. You are more muscular. And your face is scarred. It all gives you character. What you had been most lacking. I'm waiting for someone. We can sit down for a few moments. Tell me what you've become, what you've been doing. You've been working in a quarry? No. You're married? - No. What are you? You're looking at me so oddly. Why didn't you rejoin me? You want to bring up our bad memories? It's a question I kept asking myself for days at a time, for nights at a time. In what sort of a mess did you leave me? Bazi in jail, the police and bailiffs at our house. They questioned me for three days. Then they kicked me out in 3rd class. One morning, at dawn, I found myself at Milan Station with no money. And I hadn't had a bath for 48 hours. You could have written. I didn't want to start blaming you. You had got me used to living like a girl, and I've continued. But in the end, that absurd woman, it wasn't me. My extravagence, it was your doing. One day, I got tired of the adventures. I gave it all up for some security. There. And if I ask you to come away with me right away? I have money. Let's leave for Monte Carlo. You haven't changed. I am sure to win. One evening... and lose it all the next. I know you. All that's over. My life is settled. There are 5 minutes, me too, when I think my life is done. Sylvia, you've forgotten? I've fogotten nothing, not the best, not the worst. And it's over. "Over"? And if I don't want to live without you? You've managed well enough for 5 years. - Calling Mme Soneillo. I'm coming. - You're Madame Soneillo? It's my name, now. The Sylvia you loved doesn't exist anymore. Perhaps she never existed. I ask your forgiveness. I hope you make your fortune, marry, achieve happiness. Here. And like at the end of fairy tales, have lots of kids. Excuse me. Liliane? I met someone I knew many years ago. It was so funny. I must tell you about it. The hairdresser was like he was never going to finish. Pierre, you like it? It's in your taste? Very nice. The perm is not something I can return to the hairdresser. And the dress? Very nice. It's part rayon, part cotton. I'm ashamed of how much I spent. At the moment, we must be careful. Every franc is a franc less. And our suitcases, they please you? Some leather, eh? You're angry with me? You're looking at me in a bad way. This is the first time that I've angered you. You preferred my hair long? It'll grow back. Listen. I have a big problem. My papers are not in order. I'm not going to be able to board the ship. If that's all it is, we can leave tomorrow. It's going to take 4 days. The tickets will no longer be vaild. Let's waste only one. I should go alone? I'll catch up with you. Why aren't you telling me the truth? You've changed since this morning. What's happened? Nothing's changed, I promise you. We are going to be happy. Why don't you say when you're going to arrive? It's so serious? - I swear to you that... Don't swear. I promised never to go against you. I'll do as you say. Open your bag. Why so much? - You'll take better care of it. And your things, should I take them too? It won't be long before I join you. I'll unpack everything, I'll iron everything and I'll wait. You haven't told me where to wait. I'll send a telegram to Marseilles. General delivery. I'll go every day. Listen to me. I don't know how to do anything except love you. And if you don't come, I won't kill myself. But you know it'll be the end of me. - Héléna. Don't say anything. I'm not Sylvia. But I love you so much. Like that... I've got it. The ace of hearts. What a joke. Can you believe it? In your game, there are no chicks. Sod them! A real legionnaire doesn't think about futile things. You don't regret her? She didn't exist. She told me herself. She was an idea of mine, something I dreamt up. And the other one... we don't even know who she was. She wasn't a bad sort. Your health, old pal. Continue. What's after my amazing achievement? And then... You think I didn't see the 9 of spades was next? I'm wrong about everything. About your medal, about your amazing achievement. It's funny. It says here that I'll live to be 100. You'll end your days in a wheelchair. With you pushing gently. To take you to the bar, you old boozer. Old humbug! Already? We leave at 5pm. I'm going to win it, that medal. I'm telling you all that was wrong. - Of course. There won't be any messages reaching down there. I'll send a postcard. It might be better not to always play the clown. Be cautious. Don't worry, go.
