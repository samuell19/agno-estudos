'This crypt right next to Goddess Durga is of Amba.' 'Amba was a great soul in Anantpur village.' She sacrificed her life for humanity, truth, and justice. 'Today, people of Anantpur, now known as Ambapuri...' 'pay homage to Amba at her tomb.' Grandma, give me Prasad (offerings). It's been too long. Pray to Goddess Durga first. I bowed down to you in the morning. You are mischievous. May your husband live long. Be blessed. Raja. Yes, mother. Geeta. Take it. Hail Goddess Amba! I reached on time for Prasad. You look happy, Bhiku. Mother, there is a reason to be happy. See, this year we've a lot of tomatoes in our garden. Geeta, sort the raw ones. Father, I've a lot of work at home. I have to cut vegetables. I have to clean the kitchen. I have to clean vessels. You should do your work. See, mother. You've pampered her a lot. She doesn't listen to me at all. Yes, Kali. I am coming to you. I didn't forget you. Grandma, give me Prasad for uncle Sarju. Where is your useless uncle? Great, brother Sarju. - You're amazing! Master Sarju, I can give away everything for you. God bless you. I swear, you're as quick as a cheetah. You! Why did you cut half of my mustache? Sir, you cannot go for a fight now. Let me shave it off. Nonsense! Why are you attacking lamely? Attack from all the sides. Just like an enemy. Hey man! If you'll get attacked from all the sides like enemies... you will die right here. You show off your skills playing this stick. But you are not strong at all. I'll prove you my strength at the right time. Right now, you should just disappear from here. Why should I? Is this your rule? You keep playing with this stick with these followers. You think you're a man! You're useless. What did you say? I'm useless. Your father is useless. Leave my hand. Sarju, leave me. I am getting late. Father must be waiting for this buttermilk. Let him wait. I'll finish this buttermilk right here. Sarju, no! Don't finish it. Someone save this for me. Leave it. You stole my buttermilk. You should get ulcers. You should fall sick. Why did you break my daughter's pot? Munim, thank God that I only broke her pot. Ask her. Why is she here in this arena? Why did she come here? - Did I invite her? Nonsense. She always interferes in men's gathering. She just can't resist herself from talking to you. Why did you come here? Tell me, why? - Why? Why did you come here? Bapu, I was quietly going home with this buttermilk. But he is a goon, he stopped me. He snatched this pot from me and drank all the buttermilk. He also broke this pot. What do I do? No, my dear. You have troubled me a lot. I always keep quiet because I respect Maa Amba. Otherwise, I would've stopped you from doing this teasing. I'll ask the landlord to block your arena. You can go, Mr Mosquito. You can't block our arena. You are an evil. I will see you later. Come on. Go now. - Let's go. Go. - Leave. Go. - Go... Welcome. Greetings, father. - How are you, Raja? Stay blessed. I'm here to wish you a happy birthday. Brother-in-law, happy birthday. - Thank you. Hail Mr Raja. Hail, grandpa and uncle. Greetings, my young Kunwar. Greetings. - Welcome. Oh, he blessed me. Let's go. - Yes. Welcome. Congratulations to you on your son's birthday. You too. Please have a seat. Greetings. We will celebrate his birthday at our palace like every year. We will be happy to have you for the celebrations. We will also be happy to be there. Greetings, uncle. Stay blessed. Have this father. - Prabha, you always forget. A daughter's father cannot have water at her in-law's place. That's why I got some Sherbet for you. Guru, hope you're having a good time. We will have a good time in the evening, master Sarju. What's happening? I've invited Munni Bai from Banaras... specially on the occasion of brother-in-law's birthday. Munni Bai from Banaras! Really? Shush... Yes. I'm longing to enjoy her performance since years. Munni Bai. "I intend to make love." "But I'll make this promise to you tomorrow." "Listen to me, my princess." "Listen to me, my princess. Everyone is married here." "I am the only bachelor here." "I am the only bachelor here." Why? "Your promise stopped me." "Your promise stopped me." "Listen to me, my princess. Everyone is married here." "I am the only bachelor here." "Your promise stopped me." "We kept postponing it everyday." "It's been years since we just kept promising each other." "Everyone makes fun of me for being single." Why? "Your promise stopped me." "Listen to me, my princess. Everyone is married here." "All my friends... All my friends are enjoying their lives." "All my friends are enjoying their lives." "But I am longing to mingle." "It is now difficult for me. I'm the only single here." Why? "Your promise stopped me." "Listen to me, my princess. Everyone is married here." "Listen to me, you merciless. Whenever I show off my grace..." "Listen to me, you merciless. Whenever I show off my grace..." "this Munni Bai cannot match up to me." "Now I wish you to be single forever." "You be single forever. - Your promise stopped me." "Listen to me, my princess. Everyone is married here." Why? "Your promise stopped me." "Your promise stopped me." You are shameless. Ruthless. How dare you look at Munni Bai with lustful eyes? She is someone worth looking at. I see! She is worth! She's a maverick woman. She's a con like you. You never gave me anything. But you gave away all the money for her! You jealous woman! I can die for her. What? Go and die for her. Why are you here? Go now. Go in her arms. I will also ask my father... to get me married to wrestler Ram Murthy. How will he get you married? He couldn't get married. My mother felt pity for him and got him married. Dare you say anything against my father. You'll be in a mess. Why shouldn't I? He's the only fool old man in this village. Hey! Uncle, you're home! You'll live long. But I don't think you'll live long. Uncle, have some laddoos (sweets). It's homemade. You've to have these shoes first. These are also homemade. Uncle, what will you've if you'll offer me these shoes? Moron, I have told you many times... don't come to my home. - Father. You curse me in my house. - Uncle. Uncle. You are flirting with my daughter! Your daughter is flirting with me. Take care of her. You wait. - Uncle, I am going. Stop. I will see you. You wait. I will not spare you today. Wait. You cannot harm me, you henchman of landlord. I see. I'll settle your matter today. You're like a malaria mosquito for this village. Malaria! You called me a malaria mosquito. Umbrella. You're taking away my umbrella. Stop him! He stole my umbrella. Uncle, follow me. Uncle, you applied oil to this stick. What about us? Come on, my child. Come on, my child. Mom, my I've sore throat since last night. Grandma, my eyes and throat are itchy. I know, both of you are mischievous. Open your mouth. Suraj, what do you want? Nothing, brother. I just want some... What? Dad, uncle want some money. Give him. Are you his advocate? Is your uncle mute? Why do you need this money? Brother, I want to buy new sticks from the market. Quiet. You cannot buy sticks. You will get injured some day. What's your problem? Why are you hurting my brother-in-law? Take it. Why do you hurt her brother...? Long live, sister-in-law. Prabha, you have pampered him a lot. You have pampered me. Hail Goddess Amba. Bhiku, have a seat. Geeta, give your father some fresh buttermilk. No, I am filled with joy. Geeta's in-laws will come tomorrow to take her home. I see. - Yes. - Geeta will leave us soon. No, Maa. I won't leave you. Silly girl. Girls are meant to leave her parents. They have to go. Bhiku, God blessed me with two sons. But I always wanted to have a daughter. Geeta fulfilled my wish. Let me do Kanyadan (give away her in marriage) if you don't mind. Maa, you've already done a lot for us. I can never repay your favors ever. If you will do her Kanyadan... my son-in-law and my poor daughter will be the blessed couple. No, I will get blessings of God. "They are teasing me. My beloved, marry me." "My beloved, marry me." "I have reached my prime youth. Marry me, beloved." "They are teasing me. My beloved, marry me." Who is it? "They are teasing me. My beloved, marry me." You fool! Confront me. Why are you attacking secretly? Go away! Brother of a bull. What did you say? You fool. - No. Leave me. What's this? You delicate man! Can't you bare berries? Now try and hit me again, shooter! I will make your weaker. I swear, I won't let you hit me at all. What if I will win? I'll stop playing with this stick. I swear on you. But listen to me. If you fail to hit me... you will let me do whatever I want. Do you accept? I accept. Let's get started. Hit me. Here you go. Come on. Here it goes. Are you running out of berries? Yeah! Open your mouth. I said, open your mouth. You'll eat half the berry and I'll eat the rest. Hey! [Indistinct Conversation.] Mr Thakur (landlord) has arrived. Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Greetings. My dear villagers, just like every year... heads of village Anantpur and other ten villages... have agreed to choose Respected Thakur Jasbir Singh as Sarpanch. Hail Thakur Jasbir Singh. - Hail Thakur Jasbir Singh. Please come on stage. Hail Thakur Jasbir Singh. - Hail Thakur Jasbir Singh. Sit down. - Sit down. [Indistinct conversation.] I am in trouble, sir. Sir, why am I being humiliated like this? What's my fault? You have been betrayed us. Traitor! How can I betray you? Yes, you! I'd acquired Raghunath's land. I wanted to create a pond for my pets. But you gave a statement against us in the Panchayat (council). Sir, Raghu is the real owner of the land. Truth! Truth! Hariharan, whatever we say is the only truth here. How could I lie in the Panchayat meeting? Sir, how could I've insulted this turban? I will pay respect to your turban. Get it off. No! Sir, you can kill me. Bury me. But don't defame me. Listen everyone! Anantpur's Suraj defeated Rampur's famous Lathiyal Ram Murthy... for consecutive three years now. He won the first prize. - Whoa! Glory to Sarju Ustaad. - Glory to Sarju Ustaad. "See the amazing lightening." "Look at her, she walks like a lightening." Sir, have as much as you want. I swear, you made us extremely happy today. He defeated Ram Murthy with his smart moves. He is Maa Amba's son. Sarju is like a lion of Goddess Durga. Of course! Why not have one more drink on this note? Yeah! - Get more. Sir, I didn't get one thing. Lajo is always following you. But she was cheering Ram Murthy during your competition. Well, Hariya... her father is a servant to the landlord. She has to be buttering someone. Of course! Hey, what are you doing here? Go to Rampur. Go and give first aid to Ram Murthy. I don't care about him. I came here to give you sweets. You hypocrite. You were cheering for Ram Murthy during the fight. Am I right? - Yes, I was cheering him up to make you jealous. So that you should push yourself to win the competition. Oh! My friends, she wanted me to win. Yes, I did. I see. You'll have to prove it now. Prove it! You'll have to drink this Bhang (intoxicated milk). Bhang! - Yes. She drank it! - Yes, she did. "Bam Bam Bhole" [Lord Shiva!] "Once you drank it, our fight got over." "Now we are together." "Once you drank it, our fight got over. We are together." "I passed your test." "But you failed, my love." "I passed the test. But you failed, my love." "Once you drank it, our fight got over." "Now we are together." Second test. What? You will have to jump in the well. That's all! "I am not a coward. I'll do anything you say." "I can die for you if you order." "I lost my heart for your bravery." "I will fight with the world for you." "Let me stay in your heart." "I won't go back home today." "The world is the witness of our love story." "The world is the witness of our love story." "I passed the test. But you failed, my love." "You drank it..." "You have lost your mind." "It's not your fault." "Step back. Step back, what are you doing?" "It's not good to be excited." "I haven't lost my mind. I'm a lover, not a coward." "Either I'm silent or I talk non-stop." "You drank Bhang and you've became a non-stop speaker." "You drank Bhang and you've became a non-stop speaker." "Once you drank it, our fight got over. We are together." "Now we are together. - Now we are together." Mom, serve me hot food. I am very hungry. You're always excited. Did you wash your hands? Go and wash your hands. He came for dinner with dirty hands. I will wash my hands after dinner. I don't serve food until you clean your hand and feet. Go. Suraj, go and get cleaned. Otherwise, you'll stay hungry. Oh my Lord! Maa, save us. Maa, help me. - What happened, Munim? Ask me, what didn't happen with me. Your son has made my life miserable. He used to trouble villagers but I used to let it go for you. But he crossed his limits today. What did Suraj do? Your useless son has ruined my daughter's life. Look at her condition. She is acting like a ghost. Stop it. She has lost her mind. Your son and his friends made her drink Bhang. Maa, tell me who will marry her? Ask him to control his mischief. Otherwise I'll leave this village. Maa, forgive me. I'll never do this again. Apologize to Neelkanth. Go to that corner and stand like a rooster. Suraj, didn't you hear me? [Makes rooster sound] - Keep quiet. Allow me to leave, Maa. So that I'll bring her back to the senses at home. Wait, Neelkanth. Have some sweets. No, Maa. You punished him. I got my sweets. Porridge! Be blessed, my child. Dear, slow down. Porridge is tasty. You have added saffron in this. You moron! You fool! Munim, I'm sleeping hungry because of you. I'll change my name if I won't make you stay hungry. I will make you sit in the dark. Uncle, I got porridge and Puri (fried puffed bread) for you. May God bless you, my child. I think, Maa is here. Go and hide there. I curse that Munim. He made you stay hungry. Sarju, eat it quickly. You must be hungry. Yes, sister-in-law. Oh no! Sister-in-law, hide yourself. Maa is here. [Laughs] - Shush. Brother, Sarju. Have your food. Where is Maa? - She is sleeping. Oh! That's fine. Go, hide yourself. Suraj. Did you eat? You ordered me to stay hungry today. No one can dare to go against your order. I see. All of you come out with plates. See, how much they love you. But you keep doing mischief all day. Why do you do all this? Sit down. Did you eat, Maa? How can I eat when you are hungry? Prabha, I am going to the city. Do you want something? You should come home safely. That's all I want. I don't want anything else. Where are you going? We will come with you to the city. I've an important work. What? - Uncle and I'll go to watch a play in the city. No one will watch any play. Play... - Raja is going for work. Who will look after here? But, Maa... - Go and check accounts with Munim. Then you'll go the sugarcane fields and water them. Rajat, you can go with your father. How can I go without uncle? Fine. You can stay home. Prabha, I'm going to meet Nani Yashoda. Keep an eye on him. Yes, Mother. - Let's go, Raja. Yes, Maa. Raja, you're going to the city market. Get Geeta's wedding dress and jewelry... from Puran tailor and Lalchand jewelers. Okay, Maa. Now you are under my control. Tell me. What do I do with you? You! - Should I spare you or punish you? You think, I am tied up. - No! Wait, sister-in-law. How far will you run? Tell me, what should I do with you? Mother. - Mother! Sarju! Uncle, should I give you a massage? You must be tired. You are teasing me! Go and take accounts from Munim. Go and water sugarcane fields with Bhiku. Okay, uncle. Mother, send my lunch in the farms. Go, we will send it. Hey, boy! Munna is going on the fields now. Prabha, what's the matter? Why is he upset? I think, mother didn't give him food yet. I forgot about it. I got this from Bansi's garden. Have some, boy. Hey you! Prabha, see how ungrateful he is. I get scolding from my father. I steal things for him. But he cannot be nice to me for a while. But he attacks me instead. I'll attack you now. You always make fun of my pain. You! - Prabha, save me. - Get aside. You'll catch me. Catch me if you can. You are useless. You can't. You can't catch me. - How can I not catch you? Greetings, Mr Thakur. Welcome, Banne. I came to the city so I thought to meet you. Tell me. I hope everything is going well in the village. Sir, what should I day? Since you left the village... we are deprived of music and dance programs like "Mujras". Banne, how do I face the village now? You know... Thakur Jasbir Singh called off my engagement with Prabha... with an excuse, she loves Amba's son, Rajender. He's helpless. I could not take it. I went to meet Prabha. Prabha Devi. I want to know, where do I lack? I am a rich and respected man. But you chose Amba's son, Rajender. Why? What does he possess that I don't? Virtues. You think, I am immoral. Your morals are buried under the pride of money you have. You forgot your morals because of alcohol and debauchery. Forget all this, Mr Thakur. I suggest you to get married. Banne, I meet many women here every night. But that pride woman have hurt me. I can never forget it. Greetings, Mr Thakur. Gulabi Bai, your choice is impeccable. It's my duty to serve you. Where is Munni Bai? - She must be waiting for you in her room. Great! Amazing! You look more beautiful when you're angry, Munni Bai. You can go and try to flatter Hira Bai. Hira Bai, what are you saying? Who is Hira Bai? You are a merciless. Don't lie. Didn't you spend your night with Hira Bai last Saturday? Her assistant told me everything. You are jealous. It means, you truly love me. Oh! Amba, I didn't get such pretty... wedding dress on my wedding. This is really beautiful. Nani, it's all because of your blessings. Maa, you called me. Bhiku, see this. This is Geeta's wedding dress and jewelry. Is it nice? Maa, why did you do all this? I have only one daughter. I want to do everything for her. I'll get Geeta have a grand wedding. Grandma, have it. Geeta, see this. It's your wedding dress and jewelry. What? Is all this for me? Yes. - I will wear it today itself. Silly. This is your wedding dress. Wear it on your wedding day only. Get me married today itself. I will wear it today itself. Shameless! Have you lost your mind? Is this the way to behave with elders? Fine! I don't want to get married. No, Sita. You've been raised in a palace, Janak's princess. You won't be able to survive the struggle of exile. Your morals won't help you get food. If Sita will manipulate her morals because she fears hunger... then she doesn't deserve to be Ram's wife. Sita, you'll get tired walking on the difficult paths. We won't get soft beds to lie down. Only a woman makes a room a home... and can flourish a family. Trust me, King of Raghukul. Sita will create a heaven in jungle. "They only ate roots and fruits." "All the days are not same." "But all the time is the right time." "They didn't get any luxury in exile." 'I will also wear my wedding dress.' Help! Help! Help! Geeta. Geeta! - Help. Geeta, why are you silent? Open the door, Geeta. Geeta, open the door. Geeta, what happened? Open the door, Geeta. Geeta. Why are you silent? Bhiku, Ganga. Is someone home? Geeta! I have noted your statement. Sign here. I've never bowed down to anyone, Ms Amba. But today, I, Jasbir Singh... my turban as pride of our lineage... I surrender this to you to save my daughter's husband. Everyone makes a mistake. I have managed everything. Only your statement can save Prabha's marriage. Mother, you've always blessed me... with my husband's long life. Please save him. Please save him. Mother, let him get his father's love. Otherwise he won't be happy. I beg of you, mother. Please save him. Please save my husband. "Go to your abode with joy, my dear daughter." "I depart you with teary eyes." "Don't forget your father." "Please come to pay a visit to me." Start the court proceedings. Your Honor, accused Thakur Rajender Singh... son of Thakur Bhanu Pratap Singh, from Anantpur... is charged under article 376 of IPC... to attempt of physical abuse with their servant Geeta Yadav... and murder of Geeta Yadav, under article 302 of IPC. Your Honor, as per the report by... inspector at Anantpur police station... there is only one eye witness of accused Rajender Singh's crime. That's the accused' mother, Ms Amba Devi. Ms Amba Devi got accused Rajender Singh arrested. That's all, Your Honor. Amba Devi, the report government prosecution read in the court... you can give your opinion on that from here. I swear on Geeta (Holy book), I'll say the truth, only truth. My son Rajender Singh killed Geeta. No! No. Accused Rajender Singh... son of Thakur Bhanu Pratap Singh committed this heinous crime... was witnessed only by his mother... Ms Amba Devi. Considering her statement... this court convicts Rajender Singh under... article 302 of Indian Penal Code... with the punishment to hang till death. Don't leave your home, dear. Don't say that to me. I became a widow because of you. You are a murderer. Prabha! I will stay with uncle. I will stay with grandma. Uncle, I don't want to go. Grandma, I don't want to go. Leave me. I won't come with you. Leave me. Uncle, I don't want to go. Grandma, I don't want to go. Leave me. 'Uncle, I don't want to go. Grandma, I don't want to go.' 'Leave me. Leave me. I don't want to go.' 'Leave me. I want to stay here.' Grandma. Uncle. I don't want to go. Grandma. Uncle. I don't want to go. No! Rajat, have some milk. I won't drink. I will have milk of Kali cow. My grandma will give me milk. You want your grandma to get you milk. She deprived you of your father's love. Son, she isn't your grandma. She's your enemy. She is our enemy. Never mention her to me. Never mention about her. Yes, Nani. How are you, Amba? Fine. Did you meet Rajat? Amba, what do I say? Since they've taken away Rajat... Rajat has stopped consuming food and water. He keeps saying one thing all day. He wants you to fetch Kali cow's milk for him. He wants you to fetch Kali cow's milk for him. Grandma! Grandma! My child. Grandma, take me home. I don't want to stay here. Son, have milk first. See, I got cow Kali's milk for you. Have it. How dare you come here? How dare you feed my son milk being a murderer? You killed his father. Now do you want to snatch him away from me with black magic? Don't say that, Prabha. I love Rajat more than my life. That's why you killed his father. I did! - Yes, you did. You humiliated me. You insulted my ancestors and killed my son-in-law. You got my son-in-law convicted for your ego and pride. The one who got convicted was your son-in-law. But he was my son! Stop it. Dare you call us your relatives. Our relations ended with Raja's life. You ended his life. No! Raja was responsible for his death. One has to pay for his crimes. The moment my son killed an innocent poor girl... he killed his mother too. I'm sad because one commits crime... but his loved ones mourn for the rest of their lives. Prabha, I request you to come home with Rajat. Home! What home you're talking about? The home where my husband died? The home where I became a widow. That's not home anymore. That's a crematorium for me. Prabha, you lost your husband. I lost my son too! I'd to kill my motherly instinct for no reason. We should surrender to basic rules of the nature. You should surrender yourself in your home. We've never surrendered to anyone and we never will. Father made a mistake when... he didn't know your real face. Leave from here. We've no place for murderers. I said, leave. Ranvir, you pushed away my mother. You pushed away my mother! I swear on my mother, I'll break your hands. Moron! Scoundrel! You pushed away my mother. Sarju. Stop it. - Moron! I said, leave him, Sarju. - You pushed away my mother. You pushed away my mother. Suraj. Mr Thakur, forgive him. Suraj, leave him. Swear on me. It was my mistake that I came here. It's not their fault. Let's go home, son. Let's go, Suraj. Prabha, that characterless man is no more. But I assure you... I will never leave you. Attention! Attention! Attention! Attention, villagers. We've elections for Sarpanch in Anantpur and 10 villages around. So everyone is requested to be present at the meeting place... in the afternoon for the same. Brother, even this time we'll get Kurta-Pajama (Long shirt-pant)... and something more is final.

All the citizens... considering the opinions of... all the citizens of Anantpur... and other members of 10 villages near Anantpur... have decided to make Maa Amba to be the Sarpanch this time. Hail Maa Amba! - Hail Maa Amba! Mr Thakur, it's a mistake. I'm an illiterate woman, I don't deserve to be a Sarpanch. I request you to be the Sarpanch. Let's go, Maa. Hail Maa Amba! - Hail Maa Amba!

You were just a spectator when I lost my husband. You were again just a spectator when... your father got insulted by Amba. Well done, my brother! Well done! I swear on you... I will kill Amba. Ranvir, don't let Amba die with ease. She humiliated me in front of all the villagers. We have to torture her to death. Amba should suffer before she dies. "Goddess Durga..." "You are victorious."

What nonsense is this? Inspector, I caught him red handed when he was burning my mansion. File a report. Arrest him. Yes, inspector. Arrest this monster. Suraj, it's too late at night. You come here with the witnesses at 10 in the morning. I'll take an action after noting their statements. Suraj, don't worry. You'll get justice. Let's go. What did you do, Junior Thakur? How dare they take my son to the police station? I will burn everyone's house. Mr Thakur, I postponed taking an action till tomorrow. But if all the witnesses will give their statements... I will be helpless. Don't worry about the witnesses, inspector. I will manage them. But how will you stop Hariharan? He was also there. He'll also give his statement. He won't give his statement. Hariharan won't give his statement. You old man, if you'll give statement against us... I will make you mute. Let's go. Suraj, tell me who all are your witnesses. Who saw Kunwar Ranvir Singh set fire in your mansion? Inspector, all of them have seen it. Nathu, Hariya, Pandey. I see. Tell me. What did you see? Yes, narrate him. Speak up. Why are you silent? Tell him. Tell him that you saw Ranvir setting my house on fire. Speak up. I saw him. Inspector, I saw this proud Ranvir setting Sarju's house on fire. All of them also saw it. But they're afraid to speak because of Thakur. Keep quiet, you traitor. Inspector, she's lying. Don't consider her statement. She's a fool. - She isn't capable to differentiate write or wrong. Father, have shame. - She didn't step out of the house last night. He's lying. No. - Trust me. Let's go. I'm not lying. I saw him. - Let's go home. All of them have seen it. - Ignore her, inspector. Suraj, do you've any other witnesses? Yes. Yes, I've one. Uncle Hariharan. Go and bring him. Nani, where is uncle Hariharan? Why didn't he come here? Son, Hariharan will never come here. Why, Nani? He could not lie. They wouldn't have let him say the truth. They killed him. They killed him. All the best. - Thank you. Suraj, what are you doing? Leave him. Stop, son. No. He lost his home. Anyone can lose their temper in this condition. Suraj, hold yourself. Let's go. Amba, everything is destroyed. Nani, Goddess puts her favorite child... through the most difficult times. She has different plans. Don't worry. Maa, I shouldn't say this but I'm saying this to you. I have a small hut. You'll have to adjust but stay in my home. Govind, I've surrendered to Goddess Durga. What place can be better than this? Sarju is building a home for us. Oh! Uncle. Be careful, son. Why are you here? Go back home, son. No, uncle. I'll help you build our house. I'll stay here with you and grandma. "One heaven is up there." "We have one heaven on earth." "One heaven is up there." "We have one heaven on earth." "Our heaven here is more beautiful than that one." "We don't know about that heaven but our home is our heaven." "One heaven is up there." "We have one heaven on earth." "Our heaven here is more beautiful than that one." "We don't know about that heaven but our home is our heaven." "One heaven is up there." "We have one heaven on earth." "The world says..." "Amba lives in this house." "This is not just a house." "It's Goddess' blessings on us." "Everyone should consciously maintain the dignity of our home." "Mother, we can die to keep your word." "We don't know about that heaven but our home is our heaven." "My ideal daughter-in-law, my loving sons." "I am lucky to have them." "Maa, you are our mother." "Who do you love more?" "All of you make me proud." "I am alive because you are around." "One of you is a piece of my heart." "One of you is an apple of my eye." "We don't know about that heaven but our home is our heaven." "One heaven is up there." "We have one heaven on earth." "Dream a lot. Love a lot." "You should love in abundance." "This is a night full of lights. It's Diwali." "Mother, our lives are enlightened because of your love." "We don't know about that heaven but our home is our heaven." "One heaven is up there. We've one heaven on earth." "This is a colorful day." "All the blues and yellows are spread all over." "Don't tease me. I'll destroy you." "I will complain to your mother." "Is the festival of Holi or is it the game of love?" "I will chase you and catch you. I'll color you, Prabha." "Where are you aiming, Sarju? Who are you pointing out?" "Where are you aiming, Sarju? Who are you pointing out?" "We don't know about that heaven but our home is our heaven." "One heaven is up there. We've one heaven on earth." "One heaven is up there. We've one heaven on earth." "One heaven is up there. We've one heaven on earth." Welcome, Ranvir. You stayed for a long time in the town. Did you succeed? Of course, dad. How can I not accomplish your task? There is a magic. Prabha will soon own all the land Amba owns. How, Ranvir? Amba owns all the property in partnership. Everyone has equal right on her property. They'd equal rights, Prabha. This is called twisting laws. You'll play a move and Amba will have to defend herself. Undoubtedly, Amba's each family member... has an equal share in her property. But Amba's husband, Bhanu Pratap Singh... gave all his farms to Rajender Singh. After his death... you own all those farms. Ranvir, as far as I know... Amba's late husband didn't make any will. So what? We made it. Here is Late Bhanu Pratap Singh's will. Now Amba and Suraj can try to prove it wrong. It's a legal matter. It'll take 10-20 years to solve. Amba might die before that. Suraj will get old till any court will give a judgment on it. Well done, Ranvir. You are amazing! How did you do this? Intelligence. A little soil. Very little tea. Some money. That's all it took to make late Bhanu Pratap's will. Now Amba and Suraj won't be able to cultivate any land... apart from a barren land that Amba owns. Father, they will die of hunger now. Mom, we've amazing sugarcane this time. Bless me. I am going to cut it now. Goddess Durga has blessed us. Seek her blessings. Hail Goddess Durga. Sarju, don't enter these farms if you want to be alive. Does your father own this farm? Who are you to stop me from entering my farm? You owned these farms in the past. Now my sister Prabha owns this farm. Ranvir, it seems you're drunk in the morning today. Sarju! Go back home. Never ride a horse when you're drunk. You'll fall. Come on. Start cutting sugarcane. Whoever will touch the crops will be killed. Suraj. Leave him. Sarju, what's going on? No, son. - Mother, get off. No. - I'll kill this monster today. Sarju, leave him. - Get aside, Maa. Sarju. What are you doing? I will arrest you. This cunning Ranvir has created a scene here. Ask anyone here. He isn't letting me cut my crops. He got his henchmen to take away my crops. You should arrest him. I wish his enemies to get arrested. Kunwar Ranveer is legally right. You've no right over these farms and crops. How dare you? - He'll kill me. - Leave him. Inspector, what is Munim saying? Why don't we've the right over our farms anymore? Maa, your late husband Bhanu Pratap Singh... gave all your farms and crops to Rajender Singh. After Raja's demise... his wife, Ms Prabha owns it. This is a lie. This is a conspiracy. This is a fraud. The court will decide the truth. Until then the court will have the custody of these farms and crops. Show me the notice. Who is Prabha? What law and order you're talking about? Did the court came here to cultivate my mother's land? Did the court came here to sow with seeds? Did Prabha ever watered these crops? - Arrest him. No, inspector. Mom, back off. I'll destroy the law that supports fraud. They're destructors of law and order. You are not above the law and order. Inspector, I beg of you. Forgive Suraj. He is immature, angry, and a fool. He will never do this again. Forgive him, inspector. Maa, I'm sparing him on your request. Sarju. Sarju. Ask your son to stay in his limits. Explain him that he can't go against us. Ranvir, get wiser before you cross all the limit of cruelty. Otherwise, it will ruin everything. Nani, why are you here? Dear, you are rich. I cannot dare to speak to Mr Thakur. But you are a woman. You can listen to me and understand me. I didn't get you. Dear, Amba and Suraj are in pain. I cannot see their condition. I beg of you. Forgive them. Nani, I heard you respecting your age. Amba and Sarju are paying for their wrong deeds. This is just the beginning of their unfortunate. You just wait and watch. Both of them will beg for food. Rajat. What have you done to yourself? - Where were you? I was cultivating our land with uncle. Our land! Dare you meet them again. I will beat you up. Prabha, he won't listen to you. He'll go to them again and be ignorant like them. Uncle, don't abuse Sarju uncle and grandma, otherwise... What will you do? You're threatening me! You won't step out of the house from now. Take him. - Let's go. Sir, Sarju cultivated his land. So what? I'll see how he gets fertilizers and seeds. Sarju, return their seeds. Return their seeds! Why? They are our loved ones. They're our loved ones and so I'm refusing to accept it. I don't want their houses to get burnt. They should not lose their farms. Return their seeds. Maa, I won't return these seeds. No way! Sarju, return their seeds. Swear on me. All of you take your seeds and leave. Maa, allow us to serve you. No, Govind. Thakur will make your life miserable if he'll find out. Go. Sarju, we cannot trouble our loved ones for our selfish reasons. It's not right. Yes, they are your loved ones. I am the only outsider here. You aren't bothered about me, my dreams, and my wishes. You always made me sacrifice my dreams. You always stopped me from doing things I loved. Maa, you have controlled my life. I have no identity. I am a puppet for you. You make me dance on your fingertips. Sarju, what are you saying? I am saying the truth. Now I realised... you've become heartless like this idol. You have no love for me. You don't love me. You can stay here alone and follow your principles. I am going. Sarju. "A mother's heart is full of love." "She is deeply hurt." "A mother's heart is full of love." "She is deeply hurt." "Mother Yashoda cries when Lord Krishna gets upset with her." "Mother Yashoda cries when Lord Krishna gets upset with her." "A mother's heart is full of love." "She is deeply hurt." "Mother Yashoda cries when Lord Krishna gets upset with her." "Mother Yashoda cries when Lord Krishna gets upset with her." "Clear your doubts if you have any." "Clear your doubts if you have any." "You can test my love for you." "You will find only love within me." "You will find only love within me." "This is the only truth of a mother." "How can you not see this truth?" "How can you not see this truth?" "Maa, don't say anything more." "Maa, don't say anything more." "I won't be able to bare this pain." "I got tears in my eyes." "I got tears in my eyes." "Maa, forgive me and smile." "Maa, forgive me and smile." "I am crying as I regret my actions." "I am crying as I regret my actions." Take this. Sell these and get seeds from the market. No, Lajo. I can't do this. I cannot sell your bangles for my farms. I cannot do this. These bangles belong to me. Don't I belong to you? Am I an outsider for you? Ruthless! How could you think this? You were never a cruel person. Do you think, I'm an outsider for you? What did you think? I'll be with you only in happy times? Did you think that about me? I am ashamed of my love. You could never make me a family member. I should die. My Sarju wants to fight his battles alone. He doesn't need Lajo. - Lajo. Dare you touch me. Sarju, you can go. I swear on you... I'll never be a part of your good times. I will never be with you. Lajo. Lajo. Forgive me. Lajo, forgive me. Forgive your love. Who gave seeds to Sarju? I asked, who gave seeds to Sarju? Goddess Durga. Yes, Mr Thakur. Goddess Durga gave seeds to Sarju. She didn't obey your orders. Mr Thakur, I suggest you to burn Goddess Durga's home. Yes, throw away her idol. Thakur, get rid of this anger. Let bygones be bygones. Well, Sarju will have amazing crops in his farms this year. Thakur, you'll be at peace to see that sight. I will surely get some peace. I'll make you mine in front of all the villagers. Dare you! Treat your sister like this. You talk too much. No! Open the door. No! No! No! Sarju! Leave my hand. Leave my hand. You want me to leave your hand. You humiliated my mother with this hand. You burnt my house. You abused Lajo in front of everyone. I break your cursed hand today. No! No! - Yes. You've crushed my mother's and my life. You had put all my efforts in vain. So here, I break your leg. No! Prabha! Prabha! I've got this as returns of all your favors on us. I've turned him into a useless piece. Take care of this body. Ranvir my son, what happened? What happened? Get up. What happened? - Ranvir. No! No. - Ranvir. Ranvir. Ranvir, I swear on you... I will kill Suraj. You guys are useless. You're good for nothing. What happened, Ms Prabha? My cart's wheel got off. Let me drop you home. No, it's fine. It will be fine. There is no trouble for me. Please, get in. Destiny has been very ruthless in your case, Ms Prabha. Your life has brought you to a point... where you are lonely and deprived. You won't be able to spend the rest of your life alone. You need a partner. You need a company. The one who can give you everything that destiny took away. If you don't mind... I'm still ready to be your life partner. - Shamsher! Prabha, I still love you. You're a scoundrel. This is your true face. Get out of my way. I hate a monster like you. One day, you'd denied to be with me. Today, you slapped me. You have to pay for it right now. 'Help! Help! Help!' Help! Prabha! - No! Sarju, don't spare this monster. He is abusing our dignity. Don't spare him. Maa! Your Honor, my learned lawyer, public prosecutor... accused my client Suraj Singh son of Bhanu Pratap Singh... has accused for murder of deceased Shamsher Singh is baseless. Suraj did not kill Shamsher. He died accidentally. I've two witnesses to prove my point. His mother, Ms Amba Devi. And the his sister-in-law, Prabha Devi. Your Honor, allow me to call my first witness, Ms Amba Devi. Permission granted. I will only say the truth. Nothing else but the truth. Amba Devi, as per police's report... Suraj Singh killed Shamsher Singh on 11 July morning. This report says, you were there at the crime scene. Please tell the court, how Shamsher Singh died. Suraj didn't kill Shamsher Singh. He rushed to hit that scoundrel on my instructions. He stopped him from abusing my daughter-in-law, Prabha. Shamsher Singh accidentally died during the fight. You can go. My Lord, I want Ms Prabha Devi to give her statement in the court. Permission granted. I will only say the truth. Nothing else but the truth. Prabha Devi, as Amba Devi said... Suraj beat up Shamsher Singh to stop him from abusing you. Shamsher Singh died accidentally in that fight. Amba Devi is lying. Order! Order! What's the truth? Your Honor, when I was coming back from the temple... Suraj attacked me due to our personal conflicts. He could have killed me. But Thakur Shamsher Singh was passing by at that time. He tried to stop Suraj and save my life. Suraj was out of control and he killed Thakur Shamsher Singh. This is a lie. Prabha, take back your false statement. You lied. You lied to save your son's life. I lied! I lied! If I wanted to lie, I would've lied... when my elder son Raja was here as a criminal. If I had lied that day... I had not lost my young son! I had not lost my family. Prabha, why are you taking this revenge from me? You can kill me if you want. Suraj did no wrong to you. Was it a crime that he saved your dignity? Is Suraj guilty of putting his life in danger to protect you? Prabha, say the truth. The world will never believe in a this relationship. Don't ruin my life for your hatred. Say that Suraj is innocent. I said what I wanted to say. Your Honor, I never lied in my life. You're the witness. You were the judge in this court. I was the only witness of my son Raja's crime. I sacrificed my son to protect the law and the truth. But today, my son is innocent. He did only one wrong. He protected his mother-like sister-in-law's dignity. But she wants him to die. Amba Devi, this court respects your emotions. But law needs proof. Prabha Devi is a victim and witness of this crime... and so this court cannot ignore her statement. Your Honor, you can pass the judgment on the basis of proofs. I won't let my son die for the sake of your blind law. I'll appeal to the biggest court of this world. That court doesn't entertain lies and conspiracies. The law in that court is not blind. That court doesn't ask for any proof from an innocent. That court will decide my and my son's future. Goddess, I'm here in your court to seek justice. You gave me the strength to punish my guilty son. But today, Suraj is innocent. Sarju is innocent. The court here is trapping an innocent and you're silent. What kind of a justice is this? I want my son back. I don't believe in this court. I want you to do the justice. You have to give me my son. Otherwise, I swear on you, I won't have water and food... and I will die right here. Well done, sister. Today you made me happy. I was longing to kill Suraj. I appreciate you. You did it with ease that dad and I couldn't do. Now Suraj will get convicted. Amba will die without food and water. Uncle. He is here. Maa. Maa, what have you done to yourself? Maa, have something. Break your fast. Maa, swear on me and have something. I'll destruct this world if anything will happen to you. I will burn this whole world. Prabha lied in the court. She wants me to die. She wants you to die. Maa, don't sacrifice your life... as an answer to all the lies that Thakurs said. Break this fast. You'll see, I'll take revenge from them for all the torture. Maa, please break this fast. Have something. I will have something... only when Goddess Durga will do the justice. You... will feed me water without these handcuffs. Go. Go back, Sarju. Sarju, swear on me. Go back. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle, wait. Please don't go. Uncle, don't go. Grandma will die. Uncle, don't go. Down with Prabha Devi. - Down with Ranvir Singh. Down with Prabha Devi. - Down with Ranvir Singh. Mr Thakur, we are in trouble. All the villagers are rebelling. Villagers are out of control. 'Down with Ranvir Singh. - Down with Prabha Devi.' 'Down with Ranvir Singh. - Down with Prabha Devi.' 'Down with Ranvir Singh. - Down with Prabha Devi.' Why are you shouting here? This is a voice of troubled poor people, Mr Thakur. We tolerated all your unfair behavior. But we won't tolerate this injustice... with Amba and innocent Suraj. Go back home if you want to be alive. We aren't here to go back home, Mr Thakur. We are here to do the justice, Mr Thakur. We want justice. We will die. But we won't let you ruin Maa Amba and Suraj's lives. 'We won't let you do it.' Down with Prabha Devi. Down with Jasbir Singh. Down with Ranvir Singh. Dare you step forward! I'll shoot you. - Down with Thakurs. Down with Prabha Devi. Down with Jasbir Singh. Rajat. What are you doing with them, son? Don't call me your son. You're my uncle and my grandma's enemy. Rajat. - Yes, I know everything. You want to kill my uncle and my grandma... by doing a conspiracy with Grandpa and Ranvir uncle. I won't let you do this. Rajat, what's wrong with you? You're insulting your mother for others. You insulted my Goddess like grandma and innocent uncle. You lied. I didn't lie. If you didn't lie... swear on your child in front of all of us. You didn't lie in the court. Swear on your son. Say that you're honest. Maa Amba is a liar. Yes, swear on me. - Swear on him. Stop this nonsense and leave. Rajat. Mom, if you'll lie on my swear, your son will die with grandma... and uncle. I will die right here right now. No, Rajat. Throw it away. Swear on me. Why, mom? Why are you scared? No, Rajat. Throw it away. You will lose your son! Uncle is also a son. Swear on me. I cannot swear on you, my son. Because you are a liar. Yes, I am a liar. I am a wrong-doer. Mom, come with me. Save uncle and grandma. Mom, come with me. Let's go, son. Prabha, stop. Otherwise, I will shoot your son. No, Ranvir. No one can stop me now. Prabha. Prabha! Ranvir! Accused Suraj Singh, son of Thakur Bhanu Pratap Singh... this court finds you guilty under article 302 Indian Penal Code. No! No, Your Honor. My brother-in-law is innocent. Suraj is innocent. Suraj is innocent, your honor. He's innocent. What are you saying? Yes, your honor. Suraj protected me. Shamsher Singh wanted to abuse me. If Suraj hadn't saved my dignity by putting his life at risk... I would have lost everything. Suraj protected my dignity. Shamsher Singh died accidentally. An unfortunate woman like me lied in the court... in return of Maa Amba and Suraj's favor. I am a criminal, your honor. I should be punished. Why did you mislead the court with a false statement? My husband's death turned me into a bad person. I held Maa Amba responsible for my husband's death... and I wanted to take revenge by killing her. I got blind in hatred and couldn't think, if I lost my husband... she also lost her son. I forgot that she isn't only a mother-in-law to me... but she is mother to my husband. I was filled with hatred. My small son made me realise all this. When I saw my son in danger... I realized... a mother has no life without her son. A mother is incomplete without her son. I am unfortunate. I tried to take away Amba Maa's son from her. I hate myself. I shouldn't have hated her. Brother-in-law, forgive me. I have been unfair with you. I am the wrongdoer. You can punish me. But please forgive me, brother-in-law. Forgive me. 'Amba!' 'Your purpose is served as a human.' 'Come with me.' "Hail Goddess!" "Hail Goddess!" "Hail Goddess!"
