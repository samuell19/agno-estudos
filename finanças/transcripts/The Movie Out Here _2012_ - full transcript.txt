When are we going to actually plan this wedding? We have to get this seating plan done. Have you even looked at it? Babe, I'm sorry, I'm just really busy. I feel like all of this is falling on my shoulders. I feel like your secretary. You think that you can just take off, and everything is going to just magically happen. Honey, it's not a good time. I can't talk, okay? I hate to break it to you, Adam, But it just doesn't work like that. And you know what else might come to a surprise Is that there's actually no little magical fucking elves that are going to make the little seating chart to make sure that your perverted aunt doesn't end up sitting on the face of my drunken uncle! No! That falls on me, Adam. That falls on me! And you know what, I am not an elf! I'm not a fuckin' elf! No... I am not an elf. I don't even give a fuck! But until then, you need to help me out! Okay. Okay, I promise you I'll look at it, okay? Okay. I love you. I said I love you! It's just, not a great time to talk. Fucking say it! I love you. Aw... I can't talk right now. It's not a good time. Well, call me back. No excuses. Well... Looks like you've really jammed it up this time, Gary. Hi, Edith. Yeah, I can't seem to fit my fingers in here. It's really tight. Hmm. If I had a dime... Come here. Come on, give mommy some of the good stuff. Well, if you're gonna work it like that, you've got to expect a little extra attention. I wasn't "Working it," Edith. You look like a man-whore. I'm just trying to get some work done here. What's going on with that strip mall in Calgary? Just some noise bylaw concerns. From a strip mall? Yeah, well they opened A new T.L. Poppers Restaurant, And some other place called "Rub you long time," Some kind of massage parlor. What's the world coming to when you can't even get cheese fries and a handjob in the same place? Got me. Anyway, I should be able to get it pushed through. Might have to pay off one of the city counsellors. Where the fuck are you going? I have to go to the bathroom. I think I've become Lactose Intolerant. Well, maybe if you ate a little bit less, you could control your bowels. Now, what's going on with that 500-unit hotel development in Fernie? Well, we've had some resistance from some of the locals, but we found a way around their zoning by-law by filing an injunction. Now, that's my boy. I want you to hand-deliver that injunction to Fernie City Hall, ASAP. No, Edith, come on. You know I hate flying. Sorry, Gary, Does the seat cushion irritate your pussy? I have an ear infection. I can't fly. More like a yeast infection. Fine, go get a pap smear. I have a great OBGYN. He'll fist you if you ask nicely. Hey, why don't you send Adam to file the injunction, huh? He's from Fernie. I can't do it, Man. I'm busy. I am not sending Adam because it's your fucking file, and you're fucking going. Nice cock, Adam. I like a little hoodie. Don't see them often enough. Ugh, Jesus, that's disgusting. I just lost my hard-on. Ow, ow, ow, ow.... Ooh! Be in my office in three minutes, and go see a proctologist. Oh, it's like feathery worms. Hey, Adam, You wouldn't mind going to Fernie for me, would you? Normally, I would, but I'm totally swamped. Ow, I think that's a placenta. I think it just winked at me. Gary, I don't actually need the play-by-play. I don't remember eating diarrhea. Oh, yeah. How's the wedding planning coming along? Are you okay? My-my chest. Quit fucking around, Man. I can't go to Fernie, all right? Gary? Gary? Oh, fuck. Oh, God. Security. Dave. Hey, it's Adam. Uh, Gary Bennett's having a heart attack. I'm in the 17th-floor washroom. Can you send an ambulance? I've got a defibrillator right here. I'll send someone up. Thank you. Hi, Hon'. I thought you said you were going to call me right back? Look, I'll get to the seating plan, I'm just sort of in the middle of something? Oh, so you love your job more than you love me? Fine. You want to talk about the seating plan? Let's talk About the seating plan. What do you want to talk about first? ♪ Well, I'm on my way ♪ To the city lights... This is where the old woman was sitting. This is where Sasquatch smashed the window here. A stylish contemporary kitchen... And a flower arrangement on the dining room table? Damn it, Cathy. Who's Cathy? My new girl. I had her take these. She has a keen eye for photography, but she's also taking a course in Interior Design. Well, the report says nothing but beer was stolen from the place. Apparently, the woman was too freaked out to be interviewed. Hey, does Cathy have black hair? Yeah. Pierced eyebrow? Yeah. Kind of over sized puffy pepperoni nipples? Gimme that. And when did you get that tattoo that says "Pain" On your back? That ain't me. What are you two Jagoffs doing at my desk? Sorry, Chief. We were just looking at graphic anatomical photos of Glacier's cheating girlfriend. Would you guys remind me again which one is Glacier and which one is Fresh? He is. I'm Fresh. I don't give a fuck which one is Glacier and which one is Fresh! What the fuck is going on? We were just going over the latest Sasquatch Crime Scene Photos, Sir. I know you Creston Guys like your creepy Sasquatch fetish, but now that you've transferred to my unit, you'll be marching to my orders, comprende? With all due respect, Sir.. You're in Fernie now. This is the real world. But in the re.. Hey! You speak when I tell you! Yes, Sir. I'm watching you two fuckers. So, what about Sasquatch? Am I sleeping? I must be sleeping because I just had a dream where I told you two bozos to stop talking about the Sasquatch. I usually get a boner when I sleep. Well, it's not there all night. I'm not too sure if it is, but its definitely there when I wake up. It's your testosterone. It peaks early mornings. That's why you wake up like that. I read it in Owl Magazine. You read about boners in a kid's science magazine? Maybe it wasn't Owl. It was something science-y. Popular Science? Will you two shut the fuck up! Got it! What we have here is a break and enter. A petty beer theft involving a traumatized Geriatric. Get her in, get the story first hand. Yes, Sir. We're on it. Remember, she's still in shock. Take her statement, and act like fucking professionals. Understand? We won't let you down, Sir. Shut the fuck up. You're just lucky you've got great hair. I want to fuck that hair. Is it weird that I want to fuck that hair? No. Clear! Okay, Clare, I got to call you back. Gary, what the hell are you doing? Oh, for fuck's sake. Is he dead this time? Well, he appears to be breathing out of his ass. You poor little fat teddy bear. Adam, you're going to have to go to Fernie. Do it for Gary, may he rest in peace. He's not dead. Yet. Isn't there anyone else? I'll ask around. Gary! You bloated unhealthy fuck! Can you fly your almost-dead fat ass to Fernie to file those papers? Nope. Looks like Gary can't make it. Have a nice flight. I'm sorry I can't get out of it. I'll only in Fernie till Monday. Well, I see where your priorities lie. You just want to go up there and party with your loser friend, Theo. Look, I've got another call coming in that I got to take. No, don't you hang up on me.. Love you. Hey, Jason. Hello? Jason? Jason! Hello? Hey, Man, what's going on? Hello? Who is this? It's Adam. Oh, hey, what's up, Adam? How you doing, Baby? Look, I'm kind of busy right now, Man. You called me. Are you okay? Are you jogging or something? Oh, shit, you know what? Man, I pocket-dialed you, but with my penis. My dick pocket-dialed you. That's crazy... Awesome. Yeah, oh, yeah... Yeah, it is awesome. Here, let me get your shoe. Yeah... Yo, Man, where you at, Son? I'm in a plane on my way to Fernie. Oh, that's crazy! I'm scheduled to fly to Calgary today. We should totally hook up. Sorry, Man, I don't have time. Okay, cool. I will meet you out in Fernie. How about that? Isn't it kind of expensive For you just to fly in for the weekend? Oh, Baby.. Man, I'm a flight attendant. Means I can fly anywhere I want to fly. Do you think I took this job for the shiny gold wings? Watch my wings, Baby. I thought you took the job so that you can have, uh, sex with the stewardesses. I'm insulted by that, Man. How shallow do you think I am? That depends. Are you with a stewardess right now? Whoa, not the bum, Girl, not the bum! Aw... Anyway, don't come.. Uh... Don't come to Fernie. I've got a lot of things... I don't have time to see you, all right? Do not come. No, Fernie, no cuming in Fernie. All right, I'll talk to you later, Man. I really gots to go. See ya later. Oh. Oh, sorry. You okay? It's no problem. Would you mind holding Morris for me for a sec? Oh. Okay. We called him Morris, you know, like that cat from the commercials? We didn't have a name for him for weeks, but then realized he just loves milk... I mean, he keeps sucking on me like a vacuum. My nipples get really chafed, you know? You look really familiar. Are you from Fernie? Originally, yeah, but I moved to Toronto. You used to hang out with Theo, right? I'm friends with his older sister. Annie. Annie Benson. Annie. Hi. Hi. Right. Annie. Wow. You have got to say hi to Theo for me. He must be really successful now. I thought he'd be some sort of CEO or neurosurgeon. He was always so bright. He failed the fourth grade.. And uh, and the seventh, and the eighth. Means nothing. Albert Eisenstein failed school and then went on to become the greatest physicist of the 20th century. How do you think he did that? I have no idea. How do you think he came up with E equals MC-two? You think he slept his way to the top? No, I, uh... You do, don't you? You think he fucked his way into the Nobel Prize, and someone else came up with the Theory of Negativity. Theo... Was a genius. Can you see anything? Not yet, Theo. Keep relaxing. You're feeling all the energy coming out of your fingertips onto your... Shag Carpet. Is there any more food? Check the fridge, Dude. I think I'm starting to feel it now. Do you see anything? Uh... Your energy is brown. I knew it. We need at least 12 more sessions. 12? I thought you said we'd be done in, like, four sessions. You want to walk around with a Brown Aura? 12 sessions. I don't know if I have the money for that. Stop your negativity. Classic Brown Aura Behavior. Sorry. I've gotta stop being so brown. Hey, you wanna hang out? I got that High-Speed Internet connection That you wanted me to get. Uh... I'll come back in a while, maybe when you're not around. Really? I have a lot of downloading to do. I don't want to monopolize your time. Cool. Door's always open. Seriously? I know you have work to do. You won't even notice me. How did you find me? I tailed you from the airport. Why? I've just always wanted to do that. I jumped in the cab, and I was like, "Follow That Car!" Okay. That's kind of weird. No, its cool. What... In the fuck? What kind of backward-ass hotel is this? This is my friend Theo's Place. He waxes snowboards and skis. I think your friend is homeless, Dawg. He's not. I think he is. What's up, Bitches? Is that Theo? No. I think Theo just got robbed. Theo! Adam! Awesome! Theo. This is Jason. He's a good buddy of mine from Toronto. Yongo Nanimaska. Hey, Man, uh, Dude, what the fuck is that smell, Man? It smells like someone mixed cinnamon with.. With asshole. I'm sorry, I'm just burning some incense. I got it from my Spiritual Counsellor. Spiritual Counsellor? Yeah, and Personal Trainer. He's been giving me a lot of great stretching routines. I'm like an inch taller now. I feel really limber. I'm not saying that you will or do, but are you capable of sucking on your own dick? This guy. I love him. Anyway, what are you guys doing here? This is crazy. I'm here on business. Why are you always talking about business, Man? Come on, what you got to do all weekend? I have to file a paper at City Hall. And I'm planning a wedding all weekend. You need to relax, Man. Just come have one beer. Cool, yeah. I was just going to shut down for the day anyway, so... What the.. Let me help you out there. It's not going to bite. I have plenty of room for you guys if you want to stay. And I have really good internet now, too, so... Thanks, Theo, Man. I'm good anywhere. There's a room in the back. It's like it was made for you. You do know I'm not Japanese, right? As if. Really? Okay. Maybe We should get out of here. See, that's what I'm talking about. Y'all two can show me your town. Yeah, that sounds good. It'll help me shake this whole Brown Aura thing I got going on. Brown? What's wrong with brown? You just need to get some fuckin' clothes on. That's what you need to do. Nothing wrong with brown, something wrong with that. This guy, I love it. I'll be right back. Not Japanese... Hmm. That's Theo. Mm-hmm. Serial Killer Theo. Nice. He's not like that, Man. He's a good guy. Yeah, I know there's a freezer full of asses and lips downstairs, trust me. He had a heart attack on the toilet. I was just scooching underneath the door. It's called mouth-to-mouth, Man, not mouth to ass. Come on. Well, I'll be back in a sec. Gotta pinch a little Brown Aura? Yeah. I'm surprised you're friends with that dude. He is seriously... What's the word I'm looking for? Oh, yeah, "Fucked Up." Just give him a chance. Hey, he's your friend, so he's my friend, okay? But for real? My man looks like a hairy basketball with teeth. You know maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I'm exhausted. Hey, Man, that's the problem with you being engaged. Your dick has no reason to be in here. You need to trick your dick into thinking that you're not engaged. Now, check out that girl right there. You go talk to that girl, that will confuse your dick. Sow the seeds of doubt into your dick's mind. Yeah, I'm going to go to Theo's, and I'm going to go to sleep. What's your problem, Man? Have one drink. You said one drink. Let's go. Okay, one drink, That doesn't mean I'm going to talk to her. One drink, then you're going to talk to her. Ow! You should watch where you're going.. Oh, my God. Danielle! Yes! It's been forever. How are you? Really good. Really surprised to see you here. You look great. You too. You know, I don't know how ugly you were before, but god damn, you banging now, Girl. You hot as shit! Thank you, whoever you are. This is a buddy of mine, Jason. Hey, Jason. Hey, Danielle! Hey, Theo! Hi. Hi. Hi. You remember Adam? Yeah, of course. So, how long are you guys in town for? A weekend. I'm here on business. What about you? You still live here? Yeah. Well, I left for a few years to go to university. Thank you, Theo. But turns out my degree helped me get a job and landed me right back here in Fernie, so... Very cool. Oh, great. What? I'm sure you remember Mick from high school. Oh, unfortunately, I do. Well, well, well, if it isn't Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum, and Tweedle... Black guy I don't know. What are you in town for, Turd-Eating Contest? Yeah, you know what? I'm very concerned about the town you come from. I'm'a leave you and Freddie Mercury's Love Child to deal with it. Have fun, excuse me. Hey, Danielle. We should bang sometime. I'll put the "Yell!" Into "Danielle." And I'll put my vagina in your dick. Sorry to hear about your waxing shit-opolis. If you need work, daddy has some asbestos he needs removed from his factory loft project. No? No takers? Well, fuck you very much then. Not you, Danielle. If you know what I mean, huh? Feed you some oats. Why don't you turn around immediately, walk out that door before I kick your nuts up into that shit-tub you call a brain. And take your creepy Quasimodo with you. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I'll suck your dick off. What? Wow. Yeah, that happens every Friday. Really? Mm-hmm. Can you believe he still lives here? Hey, Everybody, This is Connie, Sylvia, and Carol. Yeah, I've managed to talk myself into their little bookclub. We talking about Moby Dick tonight, ain't we, Girls? Theo, can we get some drinks for the ladies? Right. Thanks, Brother. I'm starting to like your little backward-assed town. We're going to go back to Cynthia's Place and discuss how my protagonist can fit into each one of their back stories. Some drinks! We need to get some alcohol. My cougars be thirsty. All right, let's move that Ho Train out, Girls. Back to your place. Drink till we forget. All right, see you in a bit. Why is it When you say it's going to be one drink, It never is. How did the Ho Train go? Yeah, Ho Train got derailed. Oh, no. Yeah. Hey, Theo, what was Mick talking about? Everything's okay at Waxopolis, right? Because from the way he was talking, It seemed like you might be In a little bit of trouble. "Trouble" is a very "Subjective" word. What the fuck does that mean? Essentially, I believe that Mick's idea of "Trouble" Is that I need to raise $15,000 to save the business. 15 grand? Are you shitting me? Theo, how did this happen? Well, I did borrow some money. For what? I tried a few alternative methods of making money In the off-season that didn't really pan out. Like what? Mostly wax-based enterprises like candles, and hair removal, like backs and vaginas and such. I'll bet. Okay. Let's go. I'm bagged, and I've had a really shitty day. Theo, did it ever occur to you that women might not want Rainman putting hot wax on their pubic hair and tearing it out and stuff? This guy, I love it! When do you need the money by? Technically, I have until Monday. But not until 5:00 P.M. Oh, well, you should be fine, then. Jesus Christ, how are you so unfazed by this, Theo? Something will happen. It's karma, the Law of the Universe. Look, I would help out, but all my money's tied up in a condo down-payment. Yeah, and I would help, too, but... Actually, no, I wouldn't help you, Brah. You're a bit of a fuck-up, Man. Sorry. What are you gonna do if you lose the place? I guess I'll live off the land, and on the charity of my fellow brethren. That's a great strategy. The hobo who lives in the dumpster behind my office has the same business model. Hey. Why don't we have the mother of all parties and trash the place? That's not a bad idea, Except... Let's not trash the place, right? We'll just have the mother of all parties. 20 bucks a head. Or more. Cash bar. I think we can cover the debt. Worst case scenario, boatloads of women, and we have a licence to print vagina. What? Don't worry about it. Okay, look, I think we have a good plan. Mm-hmm. This could work. Yeah! I thought you were doing some Kung Fu or something. No. Check it out, Dudes. Well, that's real cool. I really like the guitar-toting snowboarding Jesus. Hey, Theo, I'm sorry to interrupt, I have this, um, "Situation." Look at this. It's ridiculous! And I have a date tonight. What happened? I kind of like it. Are you kidding me? It looks like a Viking is eating a tulip. How did this happen? This isn't my wax job, it's barbaric. It looks like you have buckwheat in a leglock. I feel like there's an Ewok trying to sell a bearskin rug to my labia. You know what, you're being a little hard on yourself. That's very European. Tres Au Naturel. It's more like an old man choking on a Persian Cat. Or like Sasquatch trying to play a small accordion. I'll see what I can do. Why don't you head into the back, and.. Wow. We'll figure it out. Guys, this, um, might take a while. Yeah, yeah. Go. She must do Kegels. Vick wins! What! Daddy, it's Mick. Yeah, I know it's you, Dickwad. Make it quick. I'm with an investor. Waxopolis. It's not a done deal. What? You'd better be joking, Shitweasel, Because not only Is that property crucial to my hotel plan, It's the next step in paving over that backward fucking town and creating a real development! Yeah, but... Theo and his friends are throwing some lame fundraising party to make the payment. Well, then, Ass-Monkey, I guess somebody has to make sure he doesn't throw that party! I'll stop the party, Daddy. I got to go. Say hi to that useless Dipshit brother of yours. Barry! Dad says he hates you. I love you, Daddy. I love you, too. Let's go, Shit-Smoothie. We got a wax shop to fuck. Let's go! Fuck... Dad loves me. Well... If it isn't the two testicles. No point on Wasting your time with your little party. You need a permit, which I presume you don't have, because you're a fucking moron. Wow. Don't you have anything better to do? Listen to me, Douchenozzle. It takes two weeks to get a permit, so you're fucking little Waxopolis fundraiser isn't going to happen. Looks like you two will just have to stay here, and wax each other off. Whatever. We're going to try to fast-track the permit anyway. Funny one, Cum-Plow. You think the permit office is even going to give a care about your bullshit legal ass-puking? No, you need a permit. No permit, no fucking party. You're in Fernie now, Dorothy. Fuck you guys later. Get to stepping, Slingblade. Oh... Whoa. This is going to be a walk in the park, Man. I will not only get the permit, I will have her at the party with six of her hottest friends, and nobody will be wearing drawers. You really need to work on your confidence. Mm. What can I say, Man? 31 years old, Hottest girl in community college. Always thought her life would add up to more than just being a paper pusher. Dated the quarterback till he knocked up her best friend. Nice hair, tasteful make-up, probably went to beauty school, worked as a stylist till her hours got cut back. Push-up bra, so you know she keeps trying, even though there's nobody in this joint to try for. Keeps getting hit on by Chip over there, and he keeps emailing her pictures of his penis. And she's starting to wonder if maybe that's the best she can do. She needs out of this town, and I'm here to rescue her. I'm like King Arthur, and my dick is Excalibur. Okay, I got to go register this. Yeah. Yeah... I work alone. Hi. I'm here to file the Magnadeuce Injunction. Hi, Clare. You've been impossible to reach. Are you screening my calls? We spoke earlier today. Oh, so now I'm nagging you? I never said that. I've been busy. So partying with your loser friends is tiring? Cool down, Clare. Cool down? I am so fucking cool, I'm fucking menstruating ice cubes! Is that cool enough for you? Are you okay? Hey. I'm sorry. Could you just send me the list for the DJ? That would be great. Uh. Okay. Thanks. Love you. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Yeah. Michael ain't dead. Whoo! Mm! Unh! So... This Sasquatch attack all took place in your kitchen, correct? Yes. That's correct. Okay, I just want to go over how it all went down. Fresh, you stand over there and be Sasquatch. Ma'am, if you don't mind. Let's go over this. Now, you said you heard a crash outside your door. I come to the door I see the creature. I grab a broom, like so, then I kick him in the balls like that. Okay, but before he accosted you, were you blocking his sight-line to the fridge. No. I distinctly remember I took a step to the side as the creature grabbed my wrist, and then I kicked him in the balls, like so. What's going on in here? We were just going over the sequence of events, Sir. Let's hear it. We don't want to waste your time. I appreciate that, but maybe a fresh pair of eyes can help. I was just saying that the creature grabbed my wrist, and then I kicked him in the balls, like this. So, the Sasquatch had a clear sight-line to the fridge that contained Kokanee. That's what I said. What happened after you kicked the Sasquatch? Oh, thank you. Let me see... I turned and fled. Thanks for your time. You can leave, Ma'am. I want to talk to you two. Look, some musician called Snow is arriving in town. Fernie PD has no extra men for security detail, so you guys are it. Aw, Snow? That's awesome. You keep it professional. You pick him up at the airport and make sure no one gets up in his grill, you understand? Of course, Sir. You guys better not fuck this up. Oh, Glacier? Some of the evidence photos from your girlfriend's camera got, uh, water damaged. Could you get me some duplicate copies? Yeah, of course. Great. If you could blow them up to 11 x 17, that would be good. I think he's really warming up to us. So did you ask her to beat it? How did you know that? That's funny. Hello, Colon Cleansers. I figured you would have crawled out of town now that you can't have your little par-tay. Show him, Theo. Wait for it. Where the fuck Did you Blood-Farts get a permit? Let's just say we have an "In." Okay, Boys, This one's on me. And later, I'm going to be on you. Mm.. Ooh. Oh... Goodness. Mama, Mama, Mama, not in front of the kids. Ooh. Ah! Will somebody please explain this fucking game to me? Hello! Hi, Daddy. Craziest thing happened today. It's about the permit. They got it. Well, how the fuck Did they get it? I don't know. I think one of Theo's friend's seduced the permit guy. Shut the fuck up! We need to change course. Now, my good friend and musician, Snow, is in town, looking at one of my investment properties. And? Well, if you don't want the fat guy sitting next to you on the bus, you throw a pack of Oolos down the aisle. Uh, I don't get it, Daddy. If you want to stop the dog from licking its balls, you've got to cover your own balls in peanut butter! Still not clear. What I'm trying to say to you is you put a concert on with Snow on the same fucking night, Moron! No one will pay attention to his lame-ass party. Now, get on it. I love you. I love you, too. Really appreciate you helping out, Danielle. Yeah, no problem. I sent invites out to all my friends, told them to spread the word. Jeremiah, hey, Man, Are you free this weekend? We're having a party here on Sunday night. This Sunday? Yeah. I'm sorry, I am busy. Really? Snow is playing at the Legion. A Snow Concert? I didn't hear about this. It was just announced. Everyone in town is going. You should move your party. Come on out. I'm sorry, Dude, I can't switch the date of my party. My soul aches for you, Theo. Thanks, Jeremiah. Please, be strong. And do not interrupt me for at least 15 minutes. Man. We're finished. It's a small show. And it's Snow. How many people are going to see Snow? Snow is huge. Adam, Snow is the shit out here. You just don't fuck with Snow. Really? Snow is big out here? We'll figure something out. I got to make a call. Hello? Gary. Hey, it's Adam. You feeling any better? No, I feel like a bag of cocks. Is everything okay out there? Yeah. Uh, well, no. A friend of mine is about to lose his ski waxing business. He owes money on his property, and we're trying to figure out a way to stop him from losing everything. This is the Waxopolis Property, yeah? Yeah, how did you know? Because Magnadeuce is trying to acquire that piece of land. The paper you filed at City Hall Was a temporary injunction on a development freeze. Wait. What are you saying? That you basically cleared a path for our client to come in and snap up your friend's property. Why didn't you tell me this? Uh, "A" you never asked, "B" I don't know your friend from a hole in my ass, "C" Magna Deuce is one of our firm's biggest clients, and they pay my salary. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck! This is.. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I'm sorry, Adam. There's not much that can be done about it now. Okay. Do me a favor and don't tell anybody in the office. Yeah, no problem. But it's only a matter of time before Edith starts asking questions. You know her. Yeah, I'll handle it. Thanks, Gary. Fuck. The poor guy's exhausted from the flight in. Maybe we should give him a couple minutes. Fresh, do you think I'm needy? What? No. No way. Why? My therapist thinks I'm needy. You're seeing a therapist? Cathy recommended I see a therapist because of our relationship troubles. You're seeing a therapist because she had sex with another guy? She thinks I'm an enabler. Hmm. Anyway, my therapist thinks I impose too many boundaries on Cathy. Wow. That's pretty friggin' deep stuff. Cathy says he's extremely progressive. He suggested a no-boundaries weekend seminar in Las Vegas. Sounds awesome. When are you going? Oh. I'm not going. It's just the two of 'em. Cathy says he likes to work one-on-one. That's cool. Congratulations, Buddy. Thanks, Fresh. See, I knew you'd understand. Hmm. Hey, is that a new flare gun? Yup. The new SG233.

I have no idea how he makes a living. I do not understand that guy. He's just throwing his life away. Why? Come on, what's the problem? He's happy. What about you? Are you happy? Sure. For the most part. I am kind of stressed out with some of this wedding stuff. Really? You should tell me. I want to know. Please? Why does it have to be so complicated? It's not complicated. You're basically organizing a party. It could be done in, like, I don't know, six hours. I swear, the complexity of it all is just a woman's way of testing how much bullshit her future sucker's going to put up with. Wow. You are so romantic. Actually, I am. I just don't think "Romance" and "Wedding" Should ever be uttered in the same sentence ever, Ever, ever. Okay. What do you think romance is? I don't have an idea of romance. Romance just happens. It's just romance, It's what it is. It's, you know... How you feel when you look at someone in the eyes and you know they're feeling the exact same way that you are. Or it's, you know, drinking Peach Schnapps out of your boyfriend's bellybutton before fucking like hobos on bathsalts for an hour and a half, I don't know. I'm just pretty sure whatever it is, it's not getting drunk and dancing to Enrique Iglesias in front of all your parents' friends. You see, we could never date, because I would not drink anything out of a bellybutton. They're filthy, right? They're like a non-functioning slightly more attractive anus. Ew. Yeah. I just hope you know what you're doing, because you're a pretty good catch. This just in, Juno Award-Winning Reggae musician Snow is in critical condition after being shot in the throat with a flare gun... This is huge. I've got to call the guys. The concert scheduled for Sunday night in Fernie is cancelled. It's true. Are you telling me that Snow is out? There's no way he can perform. Why is it that everything you touch turns to shit? It wasn't my fault! It was an act of God. Well, we better pray that an act of God stops this loser's party, or else! Or else? The balls will no longer share the taint with the anus. I don't follow. Hold on. Mm. Sergio, this is delicious. Load me up. You solve this problem, or you're cut off! No more free condo. No more free car leases. No money. You got it?

Just listen, Dog, all that footage you see of the dead bodies? That's not from their teeth. The penis rips.. How do you know this? I watch Wild Kingdom. I feel bad enough as it is, Let's not hoist all this crap on me. No, we need to go pick him up, Because that dude, he thinks I'm Asian. Yeah... Yeah. You need to pick him up.

Holy crap. Sasquatch. Where's McSorley? Over here. Get back to work! Hey, Sasquatch. How are you? What's happening here? We're trying on bikinis for our next scene. We're shooting a Kokanee Commercial. Cool. Is that why I saw the dude with the furry suit? That's not just a dude. That's Marty McSorley. The famous gynecologist? Ah, no. The Hockey Player. He's working on his acting career. Are you okay? I think I ate a bad batch of berries. They're not sitting pretty. Yeah, you don't look so good. Can you direct me to the washroom, please? You mean the porta-potty? Yeah. Go to woods where you see that orange marker. Follow the trail down to a set of rocks. Go right, then left, then go down the small hill, and it's on the right. You can't miss it. Got it. Thanks. You're welcome. Thanks for getting to this so quickly, Gord. No, problem, Guys. So, what's the verdict? Well, there's definitely a footprint there Larger than a human's. Is that Sasquatch's turd? I wish. It was probably made by a grizzly bear. Blueberries. Salmon bones. What's that? Oh, I must have missed that. Okay, zoom in. Enhance. Zoom in a little more. Enhance. To the left. Zoom in. Zoom in. Wait, back out. What is that? It looks like a hair of some sort. It wasn't internalized by the bear. It's on the surface. My guess is it was left there By whatever made the footprint. Let me see if we can get you guys an ultraviolet scan. Hmm. Well, it's not human. Yes! Well, it's not Sasquatch's either... That's man-made. That's a Polymer-Based Synthetic. Sort of thing you might find in a wig Or in a costume. Anything else? No, that's it, Gents. Thanks, Gordo. Oh, hey, Glacier. Yeah? Uh, say hi to Cathy for me. Oh, you know Cathy? Do I know Cathy. She's a friend. Of a friend's neighbor. Tell her, "Hi from Gord." Gord from the lab. She walks my dog... If you know what I'm saying. Make sure you say "Lab Gord," too! Not "R&D Gord." That's a different guy. My nickname's "Horse!" Look, we got to figure out a way to make this party happen. It's my fault that Theo is in this mess. Your fault? You said when you came up here, you didn't know that your client wanted this property, right? Yeah. And the only reason you're involved in this is that that big, fat bloated dude had a heart attack and shit all down your mouth and down your throat, right? He did not shit down my throat, okay? He had a heart attack on the toilet. The fart was a little misty, but.. Tomato, tomahto, okay? You are a victim of circumstances, my friend. Well... And Theo? Man, that dude's a victim of being born with his head up his ass. Either way, it's not your fault. I can't help but feel like it is. The guy's practically family. We've got to figure out a way to make this party happen. All right, fine, fine. Maybe I can get the beer. How do you plan on doing that? Well, I have made a lot of girlfriends in Fernie. We've only been here for a day. Does that surprise you? I'm the only black man for miles around. This is light. How does this help? These women got to have some beer, or know someone who does have some beer. I'll simply exchange my body for beer. Huh? Okay. Okay, you hunt for the beer, I'm going to continue to set up. Pow. All right. Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty! You're going too fast! Wait up! I'll follow you to the can! Thanks, Trav. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, yeah, I'll tell her you said hi. So, what did the costume shop say? They only had one costume that matched the color of the hairs found in the turd. Oh? Turns out they made some custom Sasquatch outfit for some commercial. Hey, you'll never guess who's playing Sasquatch. Who? Marty McSorley. The Fashion Designer? Get out. The Hockey Player. Really? So I guess we just have to find Marty. I can't believe McSorley is our prime suspect. Incredible. I know. I mean, what are the odds? Oh. I meant that it's incredible that you get, like, five boners throughout the night. That's a lot of boners. Five boners? That doesn't seem like a lot of boners. Check that again. You sure that's not five boners an hour? I'm just saying, That's not a lot of boners. Trust me, not where I come from. Where do you come from? Prison. Hmm.

Theo's very lucky to have you look out for him. Honestly, I kind of feel like the party's as much for me as it is for him. What do you mean? I guess I'm just glad to be back, you know? I miss it here. Don't you ever struggle with your decisions? Adam, I do what I love, and if I don't love it, then I stop. You should try it some time. I kinda hate you. Who's that? No idea. Hey, Adam. Danielle. How the fuck are you two? What do you want, Mick? I ran into someone you may know... By sheer fucking coinkidink. Adam, you know Edith. The woman who holds your career by its fucking nutsack. Oh, fuck. So, nice to see you, Dear. Mick was kind enough to fly me out to see some of the properties we've been working on at the firm. Is that your boss? Yes. Edith, this is Danielle. Hmm. Now, Mick here has been telling me that you may have been interfering in a deal that is very important to his father's company, which means that it's very important to our firm. Now, we sent you out here to shut down Waxopolis, not save it. Adam, what the shit is she talking about? I'm sorry, Dear, your girlfriend doesn't know why you were sent out here? I was covering for a sick partner at the firm, okay? I had no idea. Come now, come now, Adam. You knew exactly what you were doing. You were trying to take Theo's property? I didn't know. I swear. I'm sorry, Dear. Adam will say anything to try to get into a woman's panties. Lord knows, he tried with me. Oh... So, this is how it is? Danielle... Why don't you go back to wherever you're from? But I'm from here. No, you're not. Not anymore. Oh, Dear, it looks like I've upset your girlfriend. Is there anything I can do to console you? You've done enough, Edith. Mick, would you be a love and take me back to my hotel? I'm at the Ridgeside. Room 234. Please stop by and bring the copies of the Injunction Request. Looks like your party's over, Dickweed.

Gimme that! What's going on? We're taking your star here, downtown. You can't do that. You'll shut down production. So find another Sasquatch. And how are we supposed to do that? Oh, I don't know, why don't you hold another contest? Let's go, chuckles. Wait a minute, we'll be missing the big party. We got to get him to the station. Can't we just check it out for a couple hours, and then book him? He'll probably enjoy it. You cool if we stop at the party? Can I at least call my attorney? Again? If he likes to party, sure. Let's go. Another one? Yeah. Yeah, thanks. I don't mean to ask A cliche bartender question, but why the long face? I got a lot going on. I've really let down some friends. Sorry to hear that, Brother. Thanks. Do you ever think about, I don't know, maybe killing yourself? What? No. Why? I'm just saying, if things are that bad, why not? I mean, you look like shit, to be honest. If it was me, I'd probably just get it over with. Oh. Reverse psychology. A little bartender wisdom. No. Oh. Seriously. Just go in the washroom. No one's around. I'll come get the gun after I hear the shot. It'll confuse the hell out of the cops. Okay, things aren't that bad. I'm not going to kill myself. Have you looked in a fucking mirror? I mean, come on. Just do it. I'll go lay down some plastic sheets in the far stall. Yeah, that's very funny. I am not going to kill myself, okay? Why not? It's the gun. Is that it? It's too messy? No, I've got a lot to live for. Like what? A wife? Kids? I'm guessing not. I have great friends. If they're so great, why are you here alone? Look, Not long ago, a friend of mine died.
