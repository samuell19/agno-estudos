Anything else? How about an order of goose bones for my fox here? [chuckles] Sorry, we're all out. He was the star of the show, today. Oh, in that program over at the school? My little brother was supposed to be in that, but he got sick. Dougie Pensen, you know him? Yeah, but I don't like him. Michael! What's he got? The flu? No, asthma. He gets these real bad attacks where he can't breathe. [Harry] Yeah, we know all about it. - Mom? - [Lois] What is it? Dougie Pensen fights! Nobody likes him. OK, but you don't have to say it in front of his sister, it's embarrassing. [kid] What's embarrassing? Well, it's like a-- Red face. Or when you say or do something and you feel like the whole world is watching you and you just wanna disappear. Oh, now. I know you felt that way on the stage today, but it's natural, honest. If you knew what I was like, getting up in front of people, I'm petrified. I can't even talk, let alone sing, I open up my mouth and nothing comes out. [Lois, in broken voice] Please, pass the ketchup. [Harry] That's true, I remember one time when you tried to get up to the PTA. Ah... don't remind me. Ow! He kicked me! Michael... Hey, your mother is talking to you. Michael, don't you kick your sister, young man. What's the matter with you? Look at me. - [Lois] Harry. - You turn around now. - [heavy breathing] - [Lois] Very funny, what's the big idea? Michael, what's wrong? Harry! Oh! - [chattering] - What's wrong? [gagging] [woman] Can somebody call a doctor? [Lois] We need help! [indistinct chattering] [woman] They need a doctor or a paramedic. [man mumbles] [doctor] OK, that's very good. Now, this one is tricky. I want you to tell me which ear hears the sound better. Are you ready? [cling and buzzing] You hear best with that one, huh? - You sure? - Positive. Hey, that's what I like to hear. Now, let's get you laying down here. Some people make me do that one over and over. They can't tell, see? They're not sure. They think it's the right ear, then they think it's the left ear. [Lois] He's had a lot of practice. It's been one thing after another practically since he was born. Asthma attacks, mostly. Urinary tract infection. They said he might have to have an operation for that one. And now, this. [doctor] Your momma's had her hands full, huh? All there, you see? Peaks and valleys. It's the classic pattern. What causes it? Oh, hard to say. Some people have a kind of predisposition. I called every relative I could think of, and nobody's had epilepsy in my family or my husband's. Yeah, well, as I said, we don't really know the answer. Sometimes... I know it sounds silly, but... sometimes I think it's something that I've done. Oh, no. Some kind of... sin that I've committed and I'm being punished. [doctor] Oh, now, that is very silly, Mrs. Gibbs. I know, I know. But why should there be so much sickness? Both children, ever since they've been born, practically? One thing after another. Why? [doctor sighs] Well, it's bad luck, of course. But some kids just grow out of it. I'm putting him on this medication for the time being. And let's give him one of these right now. And this one is for Mother. To help her cope. I take the kids to the doctor, they get candy and I get Valium. [labored breathing] [door closing] - Honey? - [Harry] Yeah? - Here. - [clattering] Ay, ay, ay... Ah... How is it going? Come here. I wanna show you something. When did we buy this new sump pump? Do you remember? Yeah, it was, uh... three years ago, right after Missy's third birthday. You're not gonna believe this. [gasps] [Lois] That looks like it's been eaten away or something. [Harry] Yeah. But what could've caused that? Beats the hell out of me. This sucker is solid brass, it's supposed to last your lifetime. Something in the water, maybe? Could be. - Oh... - Where you going? Upstairs, to wash my feet. [mechanical humming] [children yelling and laughing] Just put your mind completely at rest, Mrs. Gibbs, we're used to this sort of thing. Well, I just thought the school ought to know that he'd had a seizure. Just in case. Yes, of course. You know? There is a special class for the handicapped. [Lois] Oh, where is it? Right here at 99 Street. [Lois] I didn't know that. Oh, yes, it's been going on for some years, now. We have deaf, partially sighted, various birth defects. Epilepsy doesn't qualify, but I suppose we might make an exception in Michael's case. He really likes his teacher. [woman] Oh, yes, of course. It's just something to keep in mind. There they are again, those guys from the Health Department. What are they doing? Wasting the taxpayer's money. And all because of a few silly articles in the paper. [Lois] What articles? Didn't you see them? They ran in the journal about a month ago. Oh, I didn't get the journal. Well, someone named Larry McGuinness wrote a so-called exposé on chemical dumping. We've had nothing but trouble ever since it appeared. I still don't understand. What are they looking for? [woman] Supposedly, some drums we buried around here way back in the 50s. In a canal, or something. And they're afraid the chemicals are getting out of them. It's all so ridiculous. Do you suppose for a minute the city of Niagara Falls would build a school here if there were any danger at all? - God Almighty! - Shh! - I don't believe it. - Shh! Please, lady! [Lois] Damn! [motor humming] [kids yelling and laughing] Michael, drop it! Put it down! How can you allow them to play here? How can you? Come on, Michael. [Harry] One two... three... pull! [grunts] Hey, you're pretty strong. - You feeling better now? - Yeah. I get back to school tomorrow. Hey, it's your friend, Tony! Daddy! You said you'd wait till I got home! Yeah, but I've got to go to work pretty soon. Yeah, but I thought we were gonna have a bonfire. That will have to wait till the weekend. I'm gonna bring my hedge over. It's dried too. There's lots of them around here. You can have a huge bonfire. Yeah, well, before you guys start pulling up the neighborhood, let's get rid of this one first, OK? [Michael] OK. Come on. Where you've been? The library, doing research. Research? Yeah. Listen, Harry, I've gotta talk to you. After work. I have to go in the afternoon shift, they called me. No, now. It's important. [Lois] " In the late 40s and early 50s, thousands of tons of chemical waste were dumped in the empty Love Canal. The canal was then filled in and the land sold to the Niagara Falls Board of Education for one dollar." - Are you listening? - [Harry] Yeah. "Subsequently, the city built a school around their newly acquired property, 99 Street Elementary School." - Only a dollar? - Yeah, how about that? "Also buried at the dump site were quantities of lindane, which can cause central nervous system disorders, including", get this, "convulsions and epileptic seizures." So, what do you think? I think you're barking up the wrong tree. They wouldn't build a school if it wasn't safe. Wait a minute, there's one more, I want to show it to you. Listen, Tony, I gotta take these envelopes to your mother. Is there any cookie in it? Get out of here. Michael, just two cookies. "Several chemicals in the Love Canal--" Honey, listen. "Several chemicals in the Love Canal are known to be toxic to the urinary system. Others can cause respiratory problems and asthma in young children." Yeah. fine. Doesn't prove a damn thing. Except someone's got it in for the chemical industry, that's all. I'll pack your lunch box. Dumb kid kicks all our blankets off. Hey. What's the trouble? - Nothing. Want some eggs? - Sure. I was talking around Courtney, the lead man over at Quality Control. You've met him. The picnic, remember? - Uh-huh. - Nice guy. Anyways. He said that stuff is buried real deep. No way it's gonna get out. People have seen the barrels. Where? Over in the field, right behind the school. One of the articles I was reading said that some of them came up after the blizzard last year. Well, according to Ron, they're in a sealed clay vault. Well, according to Larry McGuinness, that so-called vault filled up like a bathtub. And then there was all that construction when they built the school. I mean, who knows what that did? - Lois, come on-- - I kid even stepped in a barrel. That happened just last year. [Harry] Well, I've never heard about it. And this guy Ron, he worked there. So what? He doesn't know. Harry, they dug sewers all around that canal when they built these houses. And there's stuff in there that could've leaked out. It's just a damn newspaper story. They'll print anything and you'll believe it. Here, let me do that. Never mind, I'll do it, Harry. - You never make it-- - Sit down. If we wrestle, you're just gonna lose. Like the doctor says... some kids just get more than their share. It's bad luck, but you've gotta live with it. [sighs] Maybe. Come on. Let's get some sleep. [labored breathing] [groaning] [Michael] I can't breathe! [Lois] Michael, here, darling, come on. It's OK, don't be frightened. Here we go, come on, into the bathroom. - [water running] - it's OK. Come on, baby. - Breathe, that's OK. - [labored breathing] Come on, breathe! Here we go, alright. Now breathe in. And breathe out. And in, and out. And again. I want him out of that school. It's not just bad luck, it's something else. - [coughing] - And I want him out of that school! Breathe in. Come on. [imitates breathing] That's it, don't be scared. It's OK, come on. [man] I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, Mrs. Gibbs. There's no way I can recommend a transfer. Why not? You can see what his condition is. Yes, indeed. But 99 Street has a program, and a very good one for children with health problems. We send kids there, not the other way around. So they can play atop of the Love Canal? So that's the real issue. You know it is! How can you sit there and...? [tapping] I'm sorry. [Bain] It's quite alright. It's just that... If there's something to it, I'm not saying there is, but... If there is something awful buried there and it's leaking, Michael would be very, very susceptible. [Bain] Well, so would any child. But if I allowed one to transfer, I'd have to allow them all. And you're not the only parent who reads the journal, Mrs. Gibbs. What are we supposed to do? Close the school out? On the basis of a few stories by a local reporter? No, I guess not. Well, as of now... today. There's officially no threat to health at 99 Street school. - [Lois] Officially. - That's right. Somebody ought to tell my kid. He keeps having these unofficial asthma attacks. Mister Baine, please. Please, don't make me keep my kid in that school. Have you thought of private schools? There are several good ones in your area. Yeah, that'd be real nice. Sorry. I'm sorry, Mrs. Gibbs. [indistinct chattering] [bell dings] - Hi, Lois. - Dave, what're you doing here? Oh, a little lease, some problem about the field. - Umm... Dave. - Hmm? Did you read those articles in the journal about chemicals in the Love Canal? Oh, yeah, but I don't believe everything I read. You think it's not true? Oh, who knows? They'll write anything to sell papers. Look, I've gotta go. See you soon. - [indistinct chattering] - [phone ringing] I'd like to see a Larry McGuinness. Name? Oh, well, he's not expecting me or anything. Well, he's up in Editorial. I'll call and see how busy he is. [dialing] Forget it. Never mind. I don't wanna bother. Well, anything you say, lady. Excuse me. If you're looking for Larry, that's him by the elevator. [indistinct chattering] - You're all set? - [man] Yeah. Oh, Larry. This lady wants to talk to you. Relax, OK? [exhales] - You don't know me but I-- - That's right. OK, well, I read your articles, - the ones on the Love Canal. - Uh-huh. Well, I've got a kid in that school, see? So naturally, I'm pretty upset. Sure. Michael, that's my son, he's got all this terrible stuff. Asthma, epilepsy, you name it. Of course, he's always been sick, but he seemed to get a lot worse once he went to that school. Uh-huh. Look, I would love to talk to you, but we have to catch a plane. Maybe you could come back sometime? No, I cannot come back sometime. I have been everywhere, all in account of your articles! Now, all I want is the truth. That's all. If you wrote those articles to sell newspapers, - then say so! - [Larry] Look! I spent a lot of time on this and I talked to a lot of people. And I believe what they told me. - I don't write lies. - [man] Larry... Wait a minute. OK. Look, I want you to do me a favor. Go and see Patricia Kinsman at Claymore-- - Never mind. - Listen to me! She's a biologist doing research on cancer in the environment. A lot of the stuff you read on my stories came straight from Pat. She also happens to be a terrific person and I know that you'll feel a lot better talking to her. So what do you say? - Well, I-I can't go today. - Tomorrow. Go for it. I'll call for you. [sighs] [knocking] [clinking] [Lois] Hello? [Patricia] Come in! It's in the fridge, bottom shelf. It's marked "rat urine." [phone ringing] And tell Dr. Green I want it back. That stuff doesn't grow on trees. I just had a very amusing thought. You don't know what the hell I'm talking about. - Huh, actually-- - [Patricia] You haven't a clue, right? You don't know Dr. Green from Dr. Seuss. I'm Lois Gibbs, we had an appointment. At least I thought we did. My God, Lois Gibbs. Of course, we had an appointment. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - Larry McGuinness telephoned me. - It's OK. Well, I've got tons of material for you. I hope you like to read. There's a lot more that you've got to have. In fact, it's a good place to start. But where the heck is it? Here it is. - Doctor Kinsman-- - It's Pat, please. OK, look, I don't know what Larry McGuinness told you, but-- That you have a child in the 99 Street school. You want him out and you're getting nowhere with the Board of Education. They don't seem to take me seriously. Oh? But they do, you scared the pants off of them. - Me? - Oh, sure. They don't need any more trouble. - They've got plenty as it is. - What? They built a school on top of a chemical dump. It's a politician's nightmare. Stories in the newspapers, government held studies... and sooner or later, some hothead is gonna hit them with a petition demanding that that school be closed. Closed? You mean till they clean it up? I mean board up the windows, padlock the doors, put a big high fence around it and keep the people out. [Lois] For how long? About 500 years should do it. Do you have any idea what's buried there? Some. What I read in those articles. Well, read these, I guarantee you'll be out circulating a petition. No... Not me. That's not me. I mean, I'd probably sign somebody else's, but all I wanna do is get my kid out of that school. I think you should, but that won't solve the problem. Every child in that school is affected. [Lois] I don't wanna solve anything. - I just-- - [Patricia] I know, you just want him transferred. But I'm telling you right now that they will never do it. - [sighs] - [Patricia] Don't you see? That would be admitting that the danger exists. That they are sitting on a powder keg. But what am I supposed to do? What the hell am I supposed to do? [Patricia] First, do your homework. Know what you're talking about. And then, if you do decide to get up a petition-- You don't understand. I didn't go to college. I barely graduated high school, they sort of let me out. It has nothing to do with education. When I had to give a book report, I cut school, I... I can't talk to people. I can't get up or anything. You have to be smart to talk to those people. Alright, if you can't hack it, I'll take the books back. I wouldn't want to waste your time. But don't come in here complaining to me about what they are doing to your son. - You've let them. - No. No. - But you don't fight fair. - [chuckles] Coffee? [buzzing] Hello. I'm Lois Gibbs. I live over on 101 Street and I'm circulating this petition for... to... circulating this petition for the close... [clicks tongue] OK. [clears throat] OK. Hello. I'm Lois Gibbs, I'm your neighbor from the 101 Street. Do you know about the chemical dump - [door closes] - over behind the 99--? Hi. Hi. I'm Lois Gibbs, and I'm here to dump on you about your-- [laughs] Getting better all the time, honey. [gags] Hi, I'm Lois Gibbs... [Harry] So, how long do you figure? A couple hours? [Lois] Hmm... [Harry] Hey, I can come back quicker - if you feel like-- - [Lois] No. No, I-I'll be fine. How... I'll just be out here with my little petition. You know? I was thinking, maybe if we all went as a family. They'll think we're selling The Watchtower. [Lois chuckles] You're probably right. Mom, we all get embarrassed sometimes. [Lois] Did I ask you, shorty? OK... here goes. [sighs] Perfectly nice people. [doorbell ringing] Holy Moses! [dogs barking] [exhales] Nobody home. You hardly even waited. I am not ringing that bell again. Well, let's call it a day. Mom... I'm just kidding. [knocking] - Oh, hi-- - Hi, Lois. How are you? Fine. I'm your neighbor from-- Yeah, I heard you were living around here. [Lois] You did? I'm Jeannie Kolchak. Used to be Hathaway. - I'm sorry, I don't-- - I'm not hurt, It just shows you how glamorous I've gotten since high school. Jeannie Hathaway... wait a minute. - [Jeannie] Drill team? - Right! I was way in the back row with the chubby brigade. We never marched, we just pivoted. I'd almost forgotten that. How are you? I'm fine. I'm forgetting my manners, come on in. [Lois] Well, thanks! So, what are you doing now? You working? [Lois] Huh, not exactly. I think it's real important to let them know how we feel. Oh, absolutely. I'll sign it right now. - You will? - Sure! Oh, that's terrific! I had this whole big sales pitch worked up and everything. Save it for him, he's the one that needs selling. My husband Don. This is Lois. - What's your name now? - Oh, Gibbs. Hi. - Hi. - Lois is getting up to close 99 Street school because of all that gunk in the ground. Go on, Lois. Convince him. OK, well, umm... I don't know if you're aware of just how much is actually buried there. It's a really... I mean, it's not for kids... I mean, for them to be playing there and all. I played there. I grew up right around the corner. - Well, what I meant-- - What he means is he's alright, so there can't be anything to it. I just don't go for all this newspaper stuff. OK, but it's not just newspapers stuff, there really is a problem. You see? These officials have even called for a meeting in Albany in August. If you could see the study I've read, there's this whole section, the evidence is all there. [Don] I gotta get to work. Don, I'm signing it. Go ahead. You're over 21. He's scared, what can I tell you? The man has worked for the chemical industry for 11 years. He's got a good job, this house... He doesn't want trouble. But Kimmy is not going to that school, job or no job. You've got a pen? Yeah, right in my purse. Is she your only one? So far. We keep trying, but... Well, last year I had a little boy stillborn. And a miscarriage before that. [Lois] I'm sorry. Well, I mean, not that we haven't had our hands full just taking care of Kimmy. You name it, she's had it, anemia, asthma, urinary infection... [Lois] How old did you say she was? [Jeannie] Two and a half. And she's already had all those things? [Jeannie] Yeah, just my luck. Where do I sign? Oh, top line. I'll need the pen. Oh, sorry. [Lois] Hello, I'm... huh... Lois Gibbs, from the 101 Street. And I'm circulating a petition to close the 99 Street school. [Lois' voice] My son goes to that school and he's been very sick. And recently we've found that there's a chemical dump under the school. And we believe that the chemicals may be leaking and causing our children to get sick. I just figured we're parents and we gotta get together and do something about this ourselves. I already have 50 signatures who are supporting us. My husband works in the chemical industry and he's concerned. And I think we all have to get involved a nd protect our children's health. I've been doing some reading about what chemicals can do - to our kids, and that's why I'm doing this. - Hi. [Lois' voice] The Department of Health is having this meeting on August the second up in Albany. They're gonna announce the results of all the tests they've been doing in the neighborhood. You've probably seen the guys from the EPA, they've been to every house on the block. Yeah, they were here with one of those air measuring devices. We use them at the plant. OK, right. Well, we thought we take this petition up to them in Albany. I mean, if we get enough signatures, that is. - Well, I'll give you one. - No, you won't. We won't sign nothing against the company. They've been good to us, they bought us this house. It's not really against-- [thud] This is rose hips, comfrey and sassafras. All grown in our own garden. Hey, doesn't that smell good? - Yeah... - [chuckles] I don't know what's keeping Tony. Tony! Michael's here! Hurry up! That kid... So... how is it going? You're getting lots of signatures? - [Lois] Close to 200. - Hey... [Lois] We're gonna take it up to Albany and turn it in on Thursday. - Can you watch the kids? - Sure, no problem. Thanks. You know? I've lived here eight years and never knew my neighbors? You start taking a petition door to door and you learn a lot. Specially if you're nosy. [laughs] Oh, yes! It helps. It's kind of scary, though. What do you mean? Well, maybe it's just my imagination, but it seems like everybody is sick around here. What do you mean? Colds and stuff? No, I mean asthma, birth defects, deaf kids, epilepsy, cancer. It seems like every house I go to. It's like an epidemic or something. Well, how can that be? I don't know. First, I thought the problem was just the school, but now... I don't know. Harry says I'm getting paranoid from reading too much. Well, as far as I'm concerned, the answer is "diet." People don't eat right. That junk food, it's a killer! Oh, Mary, I'd hate for you to see the inside of my fridge. - [creaking] - [laughs] Tony Belinski! You get in here! You've been playing in that creek, haven't you? I didn't go in. Very far. [Mary] You know you're not supposed to play there! You look like a Polish Huckleberry Finn. Come here. Now, wash all that stuff off under the hose before you eat it. And stay in the yard! You hear? [door creaking and slamming] Kids. [laughs] - [Lois gasps] - [Harry] What's the matter? What if they ask me questions? [Harry] Just answer them. It's easy for you to say. - OK, but suppose-- - Oh, don't start every sentence with "OK", it's a bad habit. OK. I mean, alright. [doctor] These interior air samples were collected in the area over a two-month period. And revealed chemical levels that are above OSHA standards. What does that mean? In light of these and other findings, this department declares that a state of emergency exists at the Love Canal. - And we recommend initially... - [indistinct chattering] [gavel banging] [doctor] We recommend initially the immediate closure of 99 Street Elementary School. Hey, they're going to close it anyway. [Harry] Looks like you wasted your time. - [gavel banging] - Wait a minute, he's not finished. [man] Order, please! Order! Furthermore, readings taken in basements throughout the area adjacent to the Love Canal disclose levels of benzene concentration appreciably higher than the recommended limit of safety. What? Therefore, we recommend that all pregnant women and children under two living in the area immediately adjacent to the Love Canal leave for their own safety. - [concerned chattering] - God! I knew it! I knew it! - What does it mean? - Oh, it's wider, - it's not just the school, it's our houses. - [gavel banging] I will clear this room if you can't be quiet! Orders have been issued to Niagara County, City of Niagara Falls-- I live near the Love Canal. My little girl is two and a half. Is she supposed to stay there? - [gavel banging] - And the Niagara Falls School district-- - Why don't you answer her question? - Honey... We will have the report of the committee read, and then take questions. Please sit down. I will not sit down, you should answer her question. Everybody's looking. A child's immune system is fully developed at the age of two. My God! How can they do it? How can they even think like that? - How can they--? - [Lois] Would you let your child live there? - That's not the point. - Oh, yes, it is. You wouldn't, would you? Because you know what is in that Canal and what it's doing to us. - Take it easy. - I live three blocks from that canal and the people on my street as just as sick! Why don't you tell us to move? Continue with the report, doctor. What are we supposed to do? Just stay there and die? - [man] Order! - No! You, people, are supposed to protect us! - [gavel banging] - [indistinct shouting] Tell them the truth, you murderers! - What? - [reporter] What's your name? What's your name? [indistinct chattering] [sighs] Were the cameras really on me? Yup, all the way. I don't believe it. What an idiot. Somebody had to do it, Lois. I'm gonna be on the ten o'clock news, the reporter said so. My kids are gonna see me screaming like a banshee and getting kicked out of a meeting. Maybe Mary put them to bed. You know what the worst part is? I didn't even get to turn in the damn petition. [chuckles] - Stop. - [laughter] [door opening] Don't even come inside. Get right down to 99 Street. All hell is breaking loose. [indistinct shouting] - Help me find Don, will you? - [Lois] Alright. I'm gonna help to find Don. [man] This is my mortgage. They can put me in jail. I'm not gonna pay and that's it. We built a bedroom in our basement. My kids sleep down there. We'll never set foot down there again. But the damage is done. [man 2] You're making a great big deal out of nothing. I grew up in this same street for 20 years and I'm fine. [woman] No, you're not. You're not fine, Jimmy. You tell them the truth. I've got two months to go. I'm terrified. I don't wanna have a deformed baby. What is gonna happen to me? - [crying] - It's OK. It's OK. You're alright. So I said to her: "don't just stand there let's get pregnant and get out of here." [laughter] [woman 2] Where am I supposed to eat now? Where am I supposed to sleep when my own house is killing me? Where am I supposed to go? [woman 3] What about my...? Do I just leave her here to die? [Dave] Testing, one, two, three, testing. - [man 4] Hey, Dave! - Yeah? - [man 3] Lois Gibbs is here! - Lois Gibbs? Are you out there, Lois? [Dave] Lois Gibbs, does anybody see her? [man 4] She's over here! [Dave] Folks, can I have your attention, please? Lois Gibbs is here, she just came back from Albany. [woman 4] Atta girl, Lois! [man 5] You told them good! [Dave] Now, we all saw our TV tonight, and a lot of us signed that petition of hers. So I want her to come up here and say a few words. - Come on, Lois! - [Dave] Come on, Lois. - [woman 4] Come on! - [Dave] How about it? [cheering and applause] [Lois] OK... [clears throat] OK... I... [mouthing] OK? Hum... Alright, now... most of you are, if you watched... Well, you saw what happened just as much as I did. What it boils down to is this. They're gonna close the school. And pregnant women and children under two will be evacuated who live right near the canal. What about compensation? [crowd] Yeah! Yeah, what about it? They seemed to have left it out. When we gonna get the money? [crowd] Yeah! Well, the guy I talked to outside the meeting room, - after I was eighty sixed... - [crowd laughs] He said he's pretty sure that the State will make funds available to those families to move them and pay off their mortgages. - How about the rest of us? - Yeah, what about the rest of us? - How about the rest of us? - [crowd shouting] Well, as far as the rest of us... officially, we are in no immediate danger. - Oh, come on! - [crow chattering] [Lois] As far as the State is concerned, there's no risk to our health, so there's no money and no help. That's it. [crowd chattering] I live four blocks from that canal and my whole family is sick. So am I! What am I supposed to do? Stay here while my kids get poisoned? Let's burn it all down and collect the insurance! [crowd] Yeah! Wait a minute, you guys! Wait a minute, hold on. I think this thing is bigger than anybody and Albany will admit. Now, I've walked around this neighborhood for a month now and I can tell you... it's not just pregnant women and children under two. We could all be poisoned here. All of us! Well, I don't know about you, but I don't intend to stay here and suffer. I'm not gonna raise my family in a house full of benzene, and God knows what else. I want out! And I think we should organize and put pressure on them. We won't let them forget us! And we'll just raise hell until they move us all out of here. [crowd] Yeah! Let's do it! [applause and cheering] I move we form a homeowners' association right now. [crowd] Yeah! I nominate Lois for president! - [crowd] Yeah! - All in favor say aye! [crowd] Aye! [cheering and applause] [man 5] Come on, Lois! [Lois] OK, now we've got to get the word out to the press - about what's happening here. - [Mary] Our first press release. [Lois] Right. Now, here is what we wanna get across. The State of New York has agreed to permanently relocate 239 families. Just the ones in the first two rings of houses next to the canal. But that leaves over 700 families still here. [Mary] Yeah, that's the part that we wanna bring to everybody's attention. [Lois] Right. I'll write something up and then pack and rewrite it in English. [Jeannie] You'll do fine, just write the way you talk. [Mary] I got Larry on the phone. He thinks we might be able to get some help from the city. And there is a meeting tomorrow. [Lois] Get the details, we'll put out a flyer. The kids can take it around. Which reminds me, we've got to do something about the children. I mean, this thing is gonna be harder on them than on the grownups. And if we're gonna be here working all day... [Jeannie] Don's going on the night shift, so he'll be home in the daytime to take care of Kimmy. Maybe some of the other guys could do the same thing. [Lois] Well, for those that can't, we could all pitch in and start a daycare program. The point is we've got to keep our families together as much as we can. [hammer banging] [indistinct chattering] - Lois? - Yeah. What're they gonna do about the rest of my family? If I have to move out, what about them? We're gonna try and get an answer on that tomorrow. They say they'll keep families together. - Lois? - [Lois] Yeah? We live outside the first two rings. My little girl has multiple birth defects. She has asthma so bad she can't breathe. They found benzene in our basement. I'm afraid for my family, to stay in my house. [sobbing] [crying] [banging] - Umm... - [sobbing] Look... All I can say is that they have promised to take another look at this area and that's why we gotta keep the pressure on. You really got to come to demonstration in Albany. And meanwhile, just don't go down in the basement and don't let your kids down there. [Mary] Excuse me. I'd like everybody to know the City Council is meeting at ten o'clock tomorrow morning, and we should all be there. Be sure to get babysitters, because we'll probably go to jail. [sobbing] [vehicle approaching] [car door opening] [car door closing] Son of a gun... [door closing] Hi there. Hi, hi. What's cooking. I wanna show you something first, come here. I traced this map of the neighborhood. What I've done is I put in these dots to represent certain illnesses. You see? Blue is for epilepsy, red is for cancer, brown is for respiratory trouble and green is for birth defects. They bunch up. That's just the point. It's almost as if certain streets are worse than others. Now, this is a geological survey, and these dark black lines are underground streams, - what they call swells. - [Harry] Uh-huh. [Lois] Look what happens when I put my disease map on top. They all ride along the underground streams. It proves that the chemicals are leaking out from the canal. Proves? Well, to me it does. The commissioner of health will probably disagree. Some more of my "useless housewife data." Speaking of useless housewives... this family is gonna get some food tonight? In a minute. [clatter] I got the day off tomorrow. I'll take you shopping. I have to go to Washington, I have to testify. Oh. [Lois] I told you a week ago. Yeah, right, I forgot. Come on, Gibbs, I marked it down on the wall calendar. - Didn't you check it out? - [Harry] No. Because it's so often. Don't you think I'd rather be home? Don't worry about it. Harry, it's important. Yeah, I know. I'll set the table. [water roaring] [reporter] Ninety-nine Street school in suburban Niagara Falls. In August of last year, this school was closed by order of the New York Department of Health. People living in the immediate vicinity were advised to move. For this school and the houses nearby lay directly on top of the nation's most infamous chemical dump, the Love Canal. [Lois] People say, "why don't you move? Just get out", you know? I say, "sure, you buy my house, I'll leave tomorrow." [reporter] Lois Gibbs, president of the Love Canal Homeowners' Association. What people don't realize is that the residents are working people. They've got a couple of hundred dollars in the bank at any given time. All their life savings are wrapped up in their houses. They have nothing else. Gibbs and her fellow homeowners have pressured local State and even Federal Government to get the remaining residents, some 2000 people, permanently resettled. The City and the State keep telling us there's nothing wrong. Then they say they're investigating. We're getting a bunch of double-talk. Hello, Jeannie? [Jeannie] Hi, Harry. Hey, would you give Lois a message for me? [Jeannie] Listen, she's on television now. Yeah, I know she is on television, I can see her. But as soon as she gets off, would you tell her to come right home? [Jeannie] Sure, is anything wrong? Well, Missy isn't any better. And I really need her here. - [Jeannie] OK, I'll tell her. Bye. - Bye. Recently, there have been unconfirmed reports that dioxin has been found in creeks up to a mile away from the canal. Yes, Dave. I pray to God it's not true. Dioxin is the most dangerous chemical known to man. It was used in Agent Orange in Vietnam. - [Dave] Thank you. - Thank you. We've been talking to Lois Gibbs in Niagara Falls, New York. [man] We're off. OK, guys, let's wrap it up. - [Dave] Thank you very much. - [Lois] Thank you. Harry called, Missy isn't any better, - he needs you home. - Alright I'll go right away. - OK. - Lois, please take time to-- Jeannie can do that. - I need you to look at this-- - I'll have to get it later. - Good luck... - OK. Mommy...? - Yes, sweetheart? - I feel funny. I know. As soon as Mary gets here, we're gonna go to the doctor and he's gonna make you feel all better, OK? I've got some real good macaroni. Would you feel like eating? Alright. You just rest, OK? I got your favorite book. [doorbell rings] I'll be right back. At first, we thought she was just falling down or something. Bruises were just on her arms and legs, but now, they're... all over her body, big red ones. The doctor says we have to wrap her in a blanket and bring her into the hospital. We have to be very careful not to bump her, because any injury and she could bleed to death. So, if you'll just take Michael... and if my teeth will stop chattering-- Where's Harry? I made him go to work. He didn't want to, but... he's lost so much time already, well, with the kids being sick and all, and we can't afford for him to lose this job. No, no. I'll be OK. I just have to get through this. Now listen, Mary, if it turns out to be leukemia-- Don't even say that. The doctor said it could be. The symptoms are all there and I've got a basement full of benzene. You read too much. [chuckles] Yeah, probably. Anyway, if it is, you're gonna have to take my place at the EPA hearings. Of course. - But it's not. - [Lois] Right. I've talked to Jeannie and she'll hold down the fort at the office. I've... done the mail... Let's see, what else...? Dumb kid. She sure picked a real good time. [car door opening] [Lois] Thanks, Mary. I'll call you from the hospital. [Mary] Good luck. [engine turning on] "'And now', cried Max... 'Let the wild rumpus start!'" Hey, that's really good. [gasps] Look at all of them dancing, just like your daddy and I used to. - Before we got too old. - [chuckles] Boy, that Max. He sure is strong. [gasps] Look! He's not afraid of anything. - Mrs. Gibbs. - Yes? Can I see you for a minute, please? Sure. - I'll be right back, babe. - Uh-huh. First of all, you have to realize that this is a tentative diagnosis. We wanna keep an eye on her, perhaps do some tests over again. But, at the moment... I do not think this is leukemia. - Oh... - Now, we're not out of the woods yet. But I'm pretty sure that what Missy has is a condition we call ITP. Meaning what? It's a long-winded scientific term. I can handle it. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. I'll stick with ITP. [doctor] It means she has a low platelet count. Has she had a viral infection recently? No. She's not taking any antibiotics or antihistamines? It's not uncommon in young children. There's nothing to do for it. But we'll keep her here quite for a few days. And it's definitely not leukemia? I'm reasonably sure it's not. I am a little concerned about her white count, but... we'll check it again in a few days' time. We won't know for sure till then? I'm sorry. I wish I could be more reassuring. Excuse me, Lois. I was at the meeting last night, but I never got a chance to ask you about my mortgage-- Excuse me. Excuse me. [sighs] [sobs] [labored breathing] [crying] Oh... [wind blowing] [honking] Hey! Hey! Hey! Is there anybody in there? Hey! What is it? What's going on? [Jeannie] Umm... we did it! - Did what? - We won! OK, you can call the station to check it out. Lois, I told you we've got to get a radio - in here. - [Lois] I know. Listen, what exactly did they say? They said: "The state of New York, the Honorable Governor--" [everyone] OK... "Has decided to move all remaining families in the Love Canal to temporary housing until such time as their houses can be purchase by an agency of the State." [cheering] Wait a minute. What else? Well, that's it. Oh, yes, they also admit the possibility that the chemicals just might be leaking out, possibly along the underground streams. Your theory, Lois. Where are they gonna put us? [Jeannie] Local motels. Whole families? Listen, if it means getting out of that house, I can stand anything. I figure we'll be there a couple of weeks, tops. Some people aren't gonna wanna go, you know? They formed a group to stay. [Jeannie] Well, that's their choice. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's have a party. Oh, I thought you'd never ask. [cheering] Wait a minute, you, guys. Wait a minute... [everyone] Oh, no, Lois... I hate to be a wet blanket, but the point is they have not really come up with the cash. This could be just one of their stalls. Two more weeks again. You know what? I don't give a damn. These people haven't had one single thing to celebrate since this whole thing began. OK, why not? [cheering] [Jeannie] Oh, that's my girl! [music playing] [laughing and chattering] You do the experiments and it's "useless housewife data," and they do the experiments and it's-- - And it's basic science. - [chuckles] Oh, that's because they work for the government. Oh, what difference does it make? As long as we get out of here. I wanted to burn somebody up after what they said about the swell theory. Turns out to be the whole basis for this order and they just wouldn't listen to you. I should've shown them my high school diploma. [laughter] To useless housewife data. - I'll drink to that. - To useless housewife data. - Hey. - Hey, how are you? Have you seen Lois? - Yeah, I think she's in the back. - Yeah. - Excuse me. - OK. - Harry. - Hey, Dave! - Have a drink. - Where's your wife? Over there, somewhere. How's Missy? She's fine. All the symptoms have gone away. We're getting our fingers crossed. Oh, by the way, the EPA wants to come and take blood samples from some of you. Why? Well, they want to do a study to see if there's been any genetic damage due to toxic waste. I just love needles. Don't worry, you little turkey. I'll hold your hand and we'll faint together. [laughter] Hey! How you doing? Got your bags packed? Lois, can I talk to you a second? Sure. - In there? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Excuse me. [laughter and chattering] Dave. Hey, what's going on? It's Jim and Mary Belinski's boy. Tony? What's wrong with him? He died today. Oh my God! How? There was something wrong with his liver, I... I know he'd been sick for a while, but it all happened so sudden. He was fine three days ago, I was out playing catch with him. He was just fine. [Lois] She did everything right, Harry. Everything. She fed her kid health foods. Pumped him full of vitamins. Then Tony goes and plays in the creek and the creek is full of dioxin. - Honey, we don't know-- - Don't tell me! Seven-year-old boys don't die from liver failure. We're getting out. We're leaving this house today. And if there's no room at the damn motel, we'll sleep in the car. I knew I should've got that four-door. Oh... I'm ranting and raving again, aren't I? You're allowed. - It's just that I'm so tired-- - I know, honey, you've been working too hard. - Oh, please, Harry, don't start that again. - But you have! Why don't you let someone else carry the ball? Stay home a little more. - [Lois] Home? - Come on, you know what I mean. Oh, Harry, I know this has been tough on you-- No, no. It's not what I'm talking about. I just think we ought to be more of a family again. Oh, but we will be. Just as soon as this fight is over. Now come on, come on, pack your things. This place gives me the creeps. [children laughing] This is the last time I'm gonna say it! [shouting] [knocking] [indistinct conversation] [woman] I know... - [woman 2] Anyway, honey... - [sobbing] She has no right to say that to me...! She has no right! [woman] I was thinking... [Lois] In February, we thought we had won a great victory. As it turns out, all we've won is the right to be cooped up in these motel rooms while the government drags its heels. Week after week. Do you have any idea what that does to family life? These people are being punished. And for what? Lois, what about President Carter's plan or federal assistance? I'll believe it when I see it. We can't sell our homes, so we can't leave. What we need is cash, not promises. - [everyone] That's right. - [Lois] That's right. I'll tell you something, this thing has been peaceful so far, but you should see these people. Some of them are living five and six to a room. We're sitting on a powder keg here. Are you saying there could be violence? I'm saying that somebody better do something damn quick or anything could happen. [crowd] That's right. That's true. [indistinct conversations] What's this thing? [mumbles] Karen didn't wanna... - Hi. - [woman] Hi. - Maggie! - How was your trip? Oh, exhausting. And a success. Well, they weren't gonna see me at all, so I went and I got a couple of reporters, I went back to the office, took off my shoe and banged on the door and said "you can see me or not, but either way, it's gonna be in the papers." - So, they finally let me in. - [chuckles] I think you're amazing. Nothing bothers you. Oh... All I have to do is give a little blood. I'm jumpy as a cat. Oh, you're gonna be fine. Listen, I'm not so amazing, I always gotta make sure I've got pockets on my clothes, so when my hands start shaking, I've got some place to put them. Listen, if you want, I'll stay in line with you. Oh, no, no. I'll be fine. You know? I don't mind giving the blood. it's the idea of what they might find that scares me. You go on. I'll see you soon. OK, don't worry. - Lois, when are--? - Two more weeks, gang! [crowd murmurs] [door opening] Where were you? I stopped at the house. I was getting kind of worried. I would've called, but I didn't want to wake the kids. The Dawsons had a break-in tonight. Oh, no... They didn't take anything 'cause Eddie came home and scared them off, but... The Mayor swore up and down they would double the patrols. It took them 20 minutes to get there. That's ridiculous. I'll just gonna have to go back there and yell some more tomorrow. Yeah, well, let's do it in the morning, OK? 'Cause I wanna paint that back porch in the afternoon. [Lois] What for? I don't know. I'll feel better. I'm gonna go get something to eat. From the machines. [Lois sighs] Somebody isn't asleep. Where did this guy come from? I don't remember him. Tony. - Oh... - His brother gave it to me. Mom... there was this big boy over at the playground and he wouldn't play with us. he said we were... ra-radioactors. [chuckles] "Radioactive." And you're not. - Are you sure? - I'm positive. I saw Tony's mom today. How did he...? How did he get chemicals in him? Well... we're not sure, but... He played down in that creek that runs behind the house and later on, they found some real dangerous stuff in there. Dioxin, it's called. Michael, what's the matter? Mom, I'm scared. I played down there once with Tony. - Oh, shh... - I don't wanna die... Don't. Listen to me, you're not gonna die. Now, you listen to me, once doesn't matter. You're just fine. Hey, you haven't had a single asthma attack since we moved in here. And you've been feeling a whole lot better in general. Am I right? My knee hurts. - It does? - From bouncing on the bed. [exhales] You're gonna get it. Now, come on. Close your eyes and get some sleep. Here. I want you to think about peaceful things, huh? Like... a big beautiful meadow with soft green grass and happy flowers. And it's got a long winding river that sparkles in the sunshine. We can go fishing. And you and Missy can run and play with a dog and kittens... That's where we're gonna go when all this is over. Some place where we'll all feel safe. Because all I want... All I ever wanted was for you and Missy not to be sick anymore. That's why I'm doing all this. So you can grow up real strong and healthy. I'll do anything for that. Anything... [clattering] [honking] [honking] You guys stay here, I'm gonna get dad. And don't come inside and you don't play in the yard, you hear? Harry! [gasps] Wow! - Where were you? - Busy. [chuckles] - What is going on? - Nothing. What do you mean nothing? You're all dressed up. Can't a man dress for dinner? We're only going for Chinese. No, I don't feel like Chinese tonight. What do you feel like? I mean, I thought you were sick of eating at the motel. I am. Come here, I wanna show you something. [laughs] What? - Harry... - [Harry] I thought we'd eat at home, for a change. I should've seen this coming, you've been spending all your time here. Where am I supposed to spend it? - The motel? - No. I'm sorry, Harry. I know this has been hard for you. Everybody crammed into one little room, lining up for meals. That's a great life! I hate it too, but what choice do we have? You wanna know? You want me to tell you? - Oh, no. No way. - [Harry] Listen to me. [Lois] We're not moving back. We'll close up the basement, we'll never go down there. How can you even suggest it? It's my house! And it's sitting on top of a chemical dump! Not on top, it's three blocks away! That doesn't make any difference. You said yourself it comes in through the basement. But it's in the water! It's in the walls--! - [Harry] But if we are careful-- - No! Forget it! I'm not bringing my kids back to this house! Yeah, they'd be better off. - Better off? - Yeah, in their own rooms, with regular home-cooked meals and some real family life for a change. [sighs] Look... I miss it. Don't you think I want that too? I don't know. I don't know what you want these days. I just... I think you have to choose which comes first. The cause or your family. The cause is my family. Who do you think I'm doing this for? That's a good question. Don't, Harry. Don't say that-- Oh, come on, Lois! You enjoy all of this! You're in the big time now. You've got your picture in the paper every other day, that's pretty good for a little girl from Grand Island. I can apologize, Harry. But I'm not sorry. I did what I had to for my kids. For my family. What else could I do? I didn't do anything wrong! And yes, I do enjoy it. I like what I've become. I never asked for this to happen! I was pushed in over my head! Sink or swim! And I swam! I was even good at it. And that made me feel good, Harry. That made me feel better than anything. All I want is to win this thing and live my life. I want my kids to be safe and healthy. And I don't want to be dumb anymore. Is that so terrible? No. I just-- I think I will stay here a couple of days, you know? Sure. [Harry] There's been a lot of burglaries lately... If I said I didn't love you... I'd be lying. I'll come over to the place tomorrow to see the kids. [engine sputtering] [reporter] For these residents of the Love Canal, today is the moment of truth. Today they will learn the results of a government sponsored study carried out on 36 residents to determine whether or not they have sustained genetic damage. Possibly due to the exposure to the chemicals buried here. Now there is a feeling of hopelessness in the air. These people have suffered much already in their ongoing struggle to be moved out. And now, they're deeply, deeply worried. Yes. I understand that. That makes no sense at all. If the results are inconclusive, say so. You've got people worried to death up here. [knocking] - Hi. - What did they say? I don't know. A bunch of gobbledygook. "Supernumerary eccentric fragments." Sound like something I flunked in algebra. Well, listen, it's just a pilot study, it doesn't mean much. Right. Don's all shook up. He wanted more children. Come on, you turkey. We've got to mail her to get out. Right. [reporter] Mrs. Hopper, we were told this afternoon that you may have been one of the 11 tested who suffered chromosome damage. Now, can you tell us what this might mean? It means that I probably have an increased risk of getting cancer. It also means that there will be a danger to my children. And my children's children. Thank you. This is Gail Shepard at the Love Canal. Listen, you really ought to go out there and talk to them. What am I gonna say? They don't want a speech. They have heard nothing but speeches - the last year and a half. - I know, but still-- I've got nothing to say to them. They know as much as I know. I'm tired, Jeannie. Of course you are, but you can't quit now. I'm not quitting! I'll never quit, but... Oh, why can't I just... work in the office for a while? With envelopes, answering the phone, anything. Just so I don't have to get up there and be on television. Where Harry can see you? - [Mary] Anybody home? - [door closes] [both] Mary! Oh, Mary... I just thought you guys might need some help. Are you kidding? This place has fallen apart since you left. Well, just point me in the right direction. Come on. I was wondering why you weren't out talking to them. I guess you're waiting for the rest of the media to get here, huh? Yeah, right. Oh... how about some coffee? For sure. Excuse me, Mrs. Gibbs, we'll be leaving now. Okay. I hope you'll emphasize to these people that the tests are not conclusive. It's a very small sample. - [glass shattering] - [man] Out here, you creeps! Why don't you just go out and tell them yourselves? [chuckles] Uh... I don't think that's such a hot idea right now. Why not? You're the Government. We'd all like to hear why we have to stay. That has nothing to do with us. Oh. We're actually quite sympathetic. [glass shattering] [man] Bring those guys out here! - [shouting] - Perhaps if you explain to them-- No, I'm all through explaining. [man 2] We want out, dammit! Are you saying you won't do anything to help us get out of here? What can I do? They don't wanna hear from me, doctor. They want action, you know? Then we're being held hostage, that's what it amounts to. [man] Sent them out here! Doctor, we are the real hostages here and we've been held for a year and a half. - It's not the same thing! - [doctor] Frank. Why don't you take a seat? I think we're gonna be here for a while. [crowd shouting] Would either of you two like an oatmeal cookie? - [glass shattering] - [man] Get out here, you creeps! [man 2] We want out, dammit! [crowd] We want out! We want out! [Gail] And what began as a small demonstration, has now grown into a national new story. Lois Gibbs has stated that the two EPA men in the Homeowners' Association will only be released when President Carter takes action on the residents demands. I understand, but that's all I know. You'll have to talk to Lois. [chuckles] It's really crazy as of right now, if you call back... I understand. - Yes, I know. - [phones ringing] I can't answer that, Lois will have to call you... Yes, hold on a minute. Who are you calling now? Only the White House. - The Whi--? - Why not? What else have I got to lose? She's drunk with power. Yes, I'd like to speak to the President, please. My name is Lois Gibbs. This I gotta hear. I'll have to call you back, thank you. Yes. This is Lois Gibbs, I'm calling from Niagara Falls, New York, the Honeymoon Capital of the USA. [phone ringing] Uh-huh, well, I need to talk to him about the residents of the Love Canal. [Mary] Hello? They're very unhappy because they've been lied to by their government. We were told six months ago we'd be given money to move, and since then, we've had nothing but excuses and stalling. [crowd] We want out! Families are breaking up, people are sick. We're desperate and I would like to know what he intends to do. [Mary] No, I understand. What about the two EPA men? - [crowd] We want out! - [Mary] No, we don't know. One moment, please. What did you do? I put them on hold. You put the White House on hold? - Yeah. - [Mary] Lois? I just finished talking to the FBI. The FBI? They're gonna be here in six minutes and they're gonna take these guys out the back door. And if we don't, quote, "release them", unquote, we're all gonna be arrested. And there could be terrible violence out there. [crowd] We want out! Now? Now. OK, get your stuff together and I'll take you out the back door. Try not to forget anything, OK? [crowd] We want out! - We want out! - [cheering] [man] Where the hell were you, Lois? - [Lois] Busy. - [man 2] When are we getting out? [Lois] Two more weeks, gang. [crowd murmuring] Listen a second, let me tell you something! I just wanna say... you, people are the best. You're my best friends. And there's nobody like you anywhere. Who else could go through all this hell and not give up? You know what a guy said to me yesterday, a veteran? He said he'd been in two wars and this was the first one where they make you bring your wife and kids. [laughter] When we win, and we're gonna win, remember how close we feel right now. Don't lose it. Don't ever lose it. And don't let anybody tell you that we don't make a difference. When we felt that our children's health was being threatened, we got off our butts and we did something! [crowd] Yeah! We've got to go on with all of our strength for them! And believe me, if I can be out here talking to you, then all of us have the courage to keep on fighting. We're not the first victims of chemical dumping and we won't be the last. But our fight is important. Because Love Canal has become a symbol. There are other people out there suffering the same way we are. Their children are sick, their water is contaminated. Well, we're fighting for them too! And someday... people will remember that we stood up, up here at Love Canal. Ordinary, law-abiding people and we weren't afraid! Believe me! We will win!
