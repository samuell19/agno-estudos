[MUSIC PLAYING] Please to hold very still. Nikita, I thought you were sleeping. I don't think so. But I'm sure my comrades will be very interesting to learn what you have been up to in here. And since when is love a crime? You are a spy, a very good one. There will be a big reward for your capture. What's the rush? You caught me with my pants down. You're making minimum wage, playing the lottery with the chance to win toilet paper. So? So why don't you let me show you the power of capitalism? Capitalism? Mm-hmm. Money. Mm-hmm. But no tricks. No. No tricks. Just treats. And it all starts with an open hand. Now you're sleeping. Come in, Agent Tania. I understand your mission was a success, as usual. I believe that the film turned out very well. However, it wasn't easy to get. That's why we put our best agent on the job. Mr. Whately, you flatter me. I mean to. You all rested now? Yes, sir. I am feeling back to my old self again. Good. Agent, I have need of your services again. Right here on top of the desk OK? Not those services, agent. Right, sir. Sorry. Have you ever heard of sensible satellite radio? All music and talk all the time? Exactly. Well, there's one special channel, 6969, which is reserved for international communications between our organization, the FBI, CIA, all in code, of course. Of course. BIKINI is represented by the "Surf's Up Radio Hour." Most of our information is filtered through these channels. Someone somewhere is jamming that signal. We don't think they've broken our code yet. They are stopping our agencies from communicating with each other, which is playing hell with our operations. I love the "Surf's Up Radio Hour." You know, I never realized that they were using it for top-secret communications, though. That's how we first learned of your successes in Moscow. Oh. I'm impressed. I need to know who's jamming our signal. We have an informant, a stripper named Patty Mercury. We think you two should get on well together. If she gives you any leads, play it through, and get back to me with the results. I'll tell you what, sir. I am not going to take this lying down. I mean, I won't let you down, sir. You never have, agent. Good luck. Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Baby, I want to get in your veins. Baby, you got no one but yourself to blame. You can run, but you can't hide. Welcome to your suicide. We both know what I'm gonna do. Your agony is my ecstasy. And I'll give you everything you need. Oh, yeah. You wanna see what? A lifetime, a lifetime of misery. Your agony is my ecstasy. Sister, I got something in store-- I enjoyed your show. Thanks. Very sensual. That's the idea. ID? Well, would you look at that, a real secret agent. That's right. So Whately told me that you had some information you wanted to share with me. Sometimes I do private shows, the kind I'm sure I don't need to explain to you, and some of our clients are very important people, the kind that you would never expect. That's exactly the kind of man or woman I'm interested in. Well, not too long ago, I was entertaining this very wealthy man named Randolph Davis. Right in the middle of a little, his cell phone rings, and the guy takes the call. What? Anyway, the phone call sounded extremely suspicious. I mean, it's not like I could talk right then or anything, but I could certainly hear. So when I got home, I called the cops, and they referred me to Mr. Whately and your BIKINI organization. You know, Patty, that was very patriotic of you. And Whately asked me to hear you out, and I believe your story. I am telling you the truth. You need to check this guy out. Can you help me with this? Sure. You know, Patty, I really need Randolph's address and phone number. If I gave it to you, he would have me killed. Well, I need it now. Isn't there some other way you can get it? Like, the phone book maybe? Patty, I know that you want to give it to me. Don't be afraid. I need it, and I need it now. You think someone killed Patty Mercury because she was about to talk? Well, that or she was about to orgasm. Interesting. I read the contents of this dart analyzed down at the lab, and it turns out it contains deadly poison. I'm not bit surprised. Deadly in an Asiatic sort of way. It's an extract of the mariposa lupine plant, which only grows in the mountains of the northern Himalayas. Exotic and dangerous. Yes. And it is rarely, if ever, used on this continent. Well, that narrows it down a little. It narrows it down a lot. So now what? We've arranged for you to meet Mr. Randolph Davis under the guise of writing a magazine article for "The Rob Roy Report." He expected at 1:00 PM. I'll let you know what I find out. Good luck. [MUSIC PLAYING] This entire mountainside belongs to Davis International. We could land a helicopter out there if we really wanted to. This is quite a spread for a weekend getaway. Yes, well, I believe in indulging in total pleasure. Therefore, we must prepare for pleasure in every indulgence. Can I quote you on that? I wish you would. Wine? I've never been one to complain, Mr. Davis. No, no. Would you like a glass of wine? Oh. Yes, please. Yes, well, I'll be right back. Please. OK. Fay Wong. Thank you. You know, you have amazing views from up here. Indeed. We can see all the world up here, but they can't see us. I bet you could run around naked outside if you wanted to, huh? Be my guest. Work first, Mr. Davis. Yes. So what is the circulation of your magazine, exactly? Oh, it's really large, I think. Mm-hmm. And your target demographic? People who read. You're being very secretive, Tania. But then again, I like that in a woman, a little mystery. Oh. I don't mean to be secretive, Mr. Davis. I mean-- oh, that's going to be a bitch to get out. Are you OK? Fine. I'm fine. Did you say I could run around naked outside? Absolutely. You know what? If you help me get this off, I will show you a good time. Can I quote you on that? Please, I wish you would. Woo! Oh, Mr. Davis. [EXCLAMATIONS] That's rude. [LIGHT LAUGHTER] How are you feeling? Oh, I'm feeling so good. I've never quite seem to want to get out of their clothes that quickly. I know. It's pretty amazing, isn't it? Yes. Mr. Davis, what a view from down here. [MUSIC PLAYING] Why, Tania, you look absolutely ghastly. Thank you, sir. I'm assuming you hooked up with Randolph Davis? I believe I did, and I think he got the better end of it. I see. I think he drugged my wine and had me perform a few lewd sex acts on him and the gardener. Did you come up empty-handed? Hardly. Before I took the nosedive, I did come across a few foreign waybill documents made out to a certain Fay Wong International Export. That's very interesting. Better still, the parts that are being shipped are the very kind that are used in radio transmitters and satellite uplinking conduits. Excellent. Did you latch onto anything else? Well-- ooh. There was the gardener, but I don't remember too much about that. You've done plenty. Wong International Exports is a front for the dreaded Tong warlord Fay Wong. Mr. Whately, I really think that I need to lay down. For years she's dominated, killed, and tortured her way to the top of Interpol's most wanted criminal mastermind list. She shows neither mercy nor compassion for her victims. It's rumored she even stir-fried her dog and served it for lunch. She's heartless, cruel, and she cheats at Texas Hold'em. No one's actually seen her in years. It was rumored that she was dead. But I see now she's been waiting and plotting in secret to rule the world. Agent? Oh. Yes? Can I get you a glass of water? No, sir. I'm fine, really. [MUSIC PLAYING] Exalted one, Mong Lee has arrived with information of an urgent nature. Very well. Let him enter. As you command. Exalted one. Do you have news for me? I bring news from America and Randolph Davis. And what does he have to say for himself? He believes we are being investigated by agents of BIKINI. Your name has been linked to his, and I believe it has brought us some unfortunate exposure. Indeed. The girl from BIKINI has been placed on our trail. It's only a matter of time before she discovers your secret fortress and leads an Interpol force straight for us. And for what purpose? I haven't done anything wrong. We are jamming their radio frequencies and their intelligence network. Oh, that. Who wants to hear the surf channel, anyway? Still, it is inconvenient for them to come here uninvited. Perhaps you should pay them a visit in America to make sure that that doesn't happen. By your command. How else may I be of service? Kim Chee. Well, you can start by checking the air in my tires. By your command. Honey, I'm home. Oh, that's right. I live alone. This is as much Chinese culture as I understand, chow mein and eggroll. Ugh. God, I feel like day-old trash. [MUSIC PLAYING] Stop. Does it hurt? Well, how about this, huh? Oh, wait. Wait. Tania. Tania, it's me. It's me. Whoa, Tania. Mark Ten. I should have known. Only the CIA would do something as low as attacking a girl when she just gets out of the shower. Hey. I was only testing your reflexes to see if they're as sharp as I remembered. And? You still got it, baby. I should've made you say uncle. Now, that would've been funny. What are you doing in my bedroom? Can we continue this conversation downstairs? I saw some Chinese food and I'm starving. You want my Chinese food? Yeah, Man, you CIA guys are cheap. I used a coupon, though. Come on. Oh. It wasn't that bad. Ow. So I ask her again. I say, you learned everything you know about sex from a manual? She says, yeah. Emmanuel, my pool boy. Oh, poor baby. Maybe you just weren't meant to settle down and get married. I guess it is crazy to think that I could have replaced a hot chick like you with some off-the-rack trim. You know, if you're trying to get back into my good graces, you're not doing so hot. No, that's not it at all, although I do sometimes wish that you and I could get back together again. Dream on. The only hot, wet treat you're getting tonight is wonton soup. Well, you obviously didn't come here for my mu shu pork. What's on your beady little mind? Mm. Mu shu pork is good. I know you're working on the radio jamming operation. So am I. Do tell. Recently, we've intercepted communications-- threats, dangerous threats against the Rhinehart family. Rhinehart family? Who are they? Who are they? They just happen to be the family who owns Sensible Satellite Radio, the ones who provide all the covert organizations with their secretly encoded airwaves. So part of this program has been subcontracted out to a private sector. And now they're being pushed around as well. Precisely. And further to that, I've been ordered to provide protective shelter for Samantha Rhinehart, their daughter, who's been specifically targeted for kidnap and murder. And what? You want her to stay here? You are one of BIKINI's top agents, and you are both girls. Duh. You are so not getting back into my good graces. Come on. This is important. [DOORBELL] There she is. Just meet her before you rule this out entirely. OK, fine. But you're not getting into my pants today, Mark. Please. Just meet her, say hello. We'll take it from there. Hey, Samantha. Come on in. Hi, Mark. Am I early? No, not at all. Don't worry about it. This is Tania. This is her house. Hello. Hi. I'm Samantha. Yeah, I know. Wow. You know what? You can just go that way. OK. You are so close to getting into my pants today. I thought you might like her. Wow. There's a lot to lick-- I mean, like. Hoo. So tell me about your problem, Samantha. Well, lately, I haven't been having any trouble. But then the notes started coming. You're dead meat, bitch. And, I'm going to get you, sucker. And then the phone calls. Is your refrigerator running? Better catch it. Do you have Prince Albert in a can? Better let him out. Before long, it felt like someone was staring at me, watching me. I could hear every breath and his burning eyes burning into my naked flesh. What? It's my job to watch her. It's for her good. Sure it is. Please, go on. The sensation was the strongest whenever I took my clothes off. And I'm a sexaholic, so I take my clothes off an awful lot. Really? Are you having these strange feelings now? No, not right now. I feel pretty safe and secure. Hm, interesting. Maybe you should remove a piece of clothing and then we'll see how you feel. OK. How's that? I feel like someone's staring at me. Is that so? You know, maybe if you take the bra off, we'll see what happens. OK, if you think it'd help. Oh, I definitely think it'll help. That's really hot. Yeah. Now I'm starting to feel like strange eyes are burning into me. Maybe I should take off the skirt to make sure. Ooh. OK. Yeah, the meter's really [INAUDIBLE] now. You said something about being a sexaholic? Oh, I can't get enough. And what does that mean, exactly? It means they want to go down on you both right now. Oh, I hope you saved room for dessert. Oh, I did. FAY WONG: You're all having fun now, thinking in your tiny minds that you're far beyond Fay Wong's reach. Little do you know that even now, Mong Lee's plotting the end to your meaningless lives. Bask now in your earthly pleasures, for soon your torment will only delight me. So then it's agreed. Samantha is going to stay in your protective custody. That's right. Although I don't know how safe that is. But at least until the CIA can assign a new bodyguard for her. Well, that all depends on Whately. But in the meantime, yes, it's OK if she camps out at my place. Good. But I don't want to get into an international incident over this. We both know that BIKINI and the CIA aren't exactly company bedfellows, and I don't know how Whately is going to react. Really. I have gone over all the fine details and have looked deep into this. I'm afraid that such a thing is not possible. But you haven't even heard us out yet. MR. WHATELY: I don't need to. Tania has a date with an airplane. She's on her way to Asia, and I wouldn't trust this mission to anyone but her. No offense to the CIA, of course. Noted. I've already heard about your little babysitting job. Tania's destiny lies in the mountains of northern China. That will be all. I'm sorry, Mr. Whately. No need to apologize. I understand she was quite a looker. Oh, yes, she was. Have a successful journey. Report to me when you get back. Yes, sir. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello. May I help you? Is the lady of the house in? No, she's not in right now, and I'm just the guest. Perhaps I may interest you in fine hairbrushes, hairbrushes for every type of hair, fine hairbrushes for every kind of occasion. Really? A traveling brush salesman. Oh, please, come in. Well, you know, I've been brushing my hair every day, sometimes more, and I thought, wouldn't it be a super idea if somebody came up to the door with a vast variety of brushes to sell to people. And here you are. Please, if just show a lady fine brushes, perhaps she find something she like. I can hardly wait. MARK TEN: [INAUDIBLE] protective custody. TANIA X: I don't want to get into a [INAUDIBLE].. Samantha, we're back. MONG LEE (ON RADIO): Mong to Empress Fay. Do you come in? Hold on. This is Fay Wong. I have disabled the Americans with surprisingly little difficulty. What are your instructions? Do you have Samantha Rhinehart in your possession? Oh, that's affirmative. Excellent. She will make a beautiful hostage. Bring her to me. What of the others? Leave them. The shame of having been defeated so easily will send a message to others who seek to interfere with my plans. MONG LEE (ON RADIO): As you command. I mean, as you command. Mong out. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ooh! Oh, sorry. Ooh. What happened? I think somebody Pier sixed me. Oh my god. Samantha. I'll check upstairs. I'll call Whately. Samantha, you up here? Samantha? Yes, I understand, sir. I hear you loud and clear. She's gone. More bad news. BIKINI is not going to accept any responsibility for this because your bringing her here was unauthorized. Now what? Well, Mr. Whately did say that it be prudent for us to get our asses on a plane to China right now and save her before it's too late, and he gave me the coordinates to her secret fortress. So this means you'll help me? What else can I do? The fate of the free world hangs in the balance. Come on, then. There's no time to lose. Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] Exalted one, I bring you the prisoner, Samantha Rhinehart. Well done, Mong. You may leave us now. What kind of deviltry is this? A most wicked and painful one, if you desire. Please me and I shall pleasure you back. Disobey me and, well, you'll just see my private party room. My father will never pay a ransom, and I have nothing to offer. I disagree. I've been watching you in the mystic smoke of the ancient ones. I think you have plenty to offer. Kim Chee. [MUSIC PLAYING] TANIA X: OK, you're going to wait for my signal, and then you're going to blow them to hell. Yeah. Wait a minute. Blow them to hell? With what? Disposable ink pen rocket launcher. You're joking. I thought everybody was using these now. No way. Oh, well. Just wait here for me, OK? And hold my purse. All right. OK. Be careful. Good luck. What if I push this button? Oh, boy. You should've been more careful with the exalted one. She has very sensitive private parts. Like I would know. Sheesh It's a shame you have to go this way, a pity. Such a waste. Yeah, it's a regular tit and the pendulum. Edgar Allan Poe would be so proud. I don't suppose you'd let me go for the best piece ass you ever had, would you? Nah. I didn't think so. Shoot. Just in time. That's called a payback. All right, Samantha. Come on. Mark's waiting to blow this joint. Blow this joint? You'll see. Thank god you guys made it. I was starting to get hot. Mong, what has happened? Blow this joint. Blow this-- blow this joint. Not now. Is that all you ever think about? No. Kaboom. Give me the ink pen. Kaboom? Yeah, kaboom. Dammit. [SHOT FIRED] [EXPLOSION] Oh. Well, that's it for her. My heroes. Ah. Come on, guys. We've got a plane to catch. And using our customized disposable pen rocket launcher, we managed to destroy Fay Wong's evil empire and all those in it, which is a shame because, uh, Kim Chee, she was pretty tasty. Excellent work. And what of Miss Rhinehart? Returned safe and sound to her family without a scratch on the paint. Well, it seems as if this cooperative effort between BIKINI and the CIA went off quite well, even if it was unauthorized and unrecognized. We may have to try it again in the future, should the need arise. So I assume that the radio waves are back up. You're correct. Surf's Up is broadcasting day and night, and communications have never been higher, all thanks to the two of you. Hey, did anybody ever figure out why Fay Wong jammed up the radio waves to begin with? Not completely, but as near as we can tell, she just hated Jan and Dean. Oh. So I guess that's it for you and me, huh? I'm sure we'll hook up again soon for another exciting adventure. Yeah? You think so? Oh, yeah. You know, if they know what's good for them. I'll get my own TV show. Cool. And that way, I can kick ass and you can be my eye candy. Really? Let's go. What else can I do? Fate of the free world hangs in the balance. Can we continue this conversation downstairs? I saw some Chinese food, and I'm starving. The sensation was the strongest whenever I took my clothes off. And I'm a sexaholic, so I take my clothes off an awful lot. Oh, that. Who wants to hear the surf channel, anyway? You should have been more careful with the exalted one. She has very sensitive private parts. Deadly in an Asiatic sort of way. It's not like I could talk right then or anything, but I could certainly hear. You're being very secretive, Tania. But then again, I like that no woman, a little mystery. You are a spy, a very good one. I've seen your picture on the "Moscow Most Wanted" TV show. [MUSIC PLAYING]
