Um, excuse me, you have a hall pass? Yeah, I'm props department, for the drill. Wow, okay, I guess they're taking it pretty seriously this time. Hey, Miss Walker, how's it going? It is going, Jay, you know you can call me Eva, right? Right, right, sorry, it's Eva, guess I'm still getting used to feeling like a grown-up around here. - Well, you can start by making a new pot. - Wow, right, now let's see-- - Here. - Yes, thank you. - You're welcome. - So, the lockdown drill today, there's actors in it? - Actors, you mean the drama students, yeah, that is actually new to me too. But I'm guessing that they are not exactly prepared to be very convincing. - Yeah, true. - Yeah. Water, add water. - Yeah, right, yep. - Papers on my desk by Friday. - Attention please, students who are not designated volunteers must leave campus as quickly as possible, the Active Shooter Drill will be starting precisely at 3pm. - Miss Walker? - Hi Simon, what do you need? - I wanted to ask about making up last week's quiz. - Okay, can we talk about it tomorrow because the drill's gonna start soon. - I'm volunteering, for the drill, I just joined drama club. - Okay, so, unfortunately because you missed the quiz, that brought your whole grade down-- - Well, my dad made me go on this fishing trip with him. - Yeah, Simon, you know the rules for make-ups. You need a note from your doctor, or a parent has to call for permission ahead of time. - Okay, I can prove that I was there. - Simon, look, hey, I'm trying to be a fair teacher. Okay, if I let you retake the quiz, I have to break the rules for everyone. - Look, look, see, you can see the date and everything. - Okay, why didn't a parent get permission beforehand? - My dad just gets in these moods, and you kind of have to go with it. - Okay, look, I'm really sorry, I cannot bend the rules, but if you want me to talk to your dad-- - It's fine, just don't worry about it. - Well, I can, maybe come up with some bonus reading. - Sorry. - No worries. - Hey, Miss Walker. - We're assigned to your room. For the drill, we're representing kids in your class. - Right, yes, sorry, I think I have guidebooks for you. - Attention please, all students and teachers, please take your places for the top of the drill. Today's drill will attempt to be realistic by going through all steps of communication as if there were an active shooter. - It's not realistic if you announce it over the loud speaker. - Hello, a shooter is on campus. I think he might be heading into the main building. - Way to commit, everyone. - Help, a shooter is in the hall. - This is Frankie Mason, a shooter has been spotted outside the nurse's office. And there are three students in here, so we've barricaded the door shut, over. - Um, apparently I need to collect your cell phones now. - Seriously? - Yes. Thank you. - Help! Shooter is in the hallway in the main building. Do the authorities know we are running this drill? - Shooter's now in the cafeteria. - Cafeteria? - We need to cover the windows. - How many student volunteers are there? - 15 to 20. - What's it say? - Nothing, just teacher directions. - Hey. - Shooter is in room 223. - three minutes. - Help. - Shooter, outside. - Teachers, please, don't overlap your voices on the walkies. Only use them for pertinent information on the shooter's location. - 223? - I didn't know we were being part of the, was that a part? - No! - That sounded real. - No, it's just a drill, okay, don't worry, I'm sure it was like a planned sound effect. Get down, under your desks. - This doesn't feel right. - Just get under your desk. Hello? - Holy shit, this is intense, I heard gunshots? - I know, I don't like it at all. - What should we do? - Miss Walker. - I have to go, they're kids in my room. Just stay here. Help, Ms. Walker, let me in! - Simon. - He's coming for me! Miss Walker, please, just open the door! - No, you have to go find a safe place. I have to keep the door locked. - Miss Walker, this isn't part of the drill. Okay, please, just open the door. Miss Walker, open the door. Miss Walker, open the door, please, just let me in. Just open the door, please, Miss Walker. - Stop! - Miss Walker, open the door, please, open the door. Miss Walker. Open the door, open the door!
