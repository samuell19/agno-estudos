Cabin crew, prepare for landing, thank you. Welcome to Bangkok, we hope you enjoy your stay. Mahalo. Next. Next station, Ratchaprarop Station. Good evening, sir. I hope I didn't make you wait for too long. Oh, not at all, you're right on time. Perfect, actually. I hope you had a nice nap. - Water? - Ah... - Thank you - You're welcome. You weren't kidding about the traffic. Believe it or not, I was expecting much worse. We're not too far away now. Uh... Ahem. Thank you. Oh... Thank you. Most people would just toss it to the side. Most people are inconsiderate. This car is spotless. You must really like this job. Well, it's decent money. Plus, I get to choose my own hours, and I get to meet a lot of interesting people. - You like to drive at night? - I have more time at night. Can't it get dangerous? Probably, but I've been lucky. Plus, the app tells me where I'm being called and where I'm heading to, so it's all right. You're a very pretty woman. You must get propositioned all the time. I'll be worried if they stop. I'm not getting any younger, you know. I take it you're not married? - No. - May I ask you... why? Never got around to it. I have a brother, he has MS. They detected it ten years ago. He's 25 now. He's everything to me. I'm sure he is. And I'm sure you're doing everything you can. lam. It's just this past year... It's gotten much worse. Yeah. MS can be like that. A lot of people who suffer from it tend to live a lot longer than they're expected to. Are you a doctor? No. But I was a field medic a long time ago. I know a little about a lot of things. Jack of all trades, huh? Master of none, that's right. - Your English is very good. - Well, thank you. I studied English in college, and that was a long time ago. Well, I won't talk about your age if you don't talk about my white beard. I watch a lot of movies as well, also YouTube videos. That's how I practice my English, but I still feel like my vocabulary isn't there yet. Well, you sound great to me. Besides, you're Thai. You don't need to speak perfect English. I'm actually half. My dad's English. But I grew up here and lived here all my life. Who knows, you know? Maybe one day I'm going to be living in a country where they only speak English, and no more Thai. Well, the office building is just up ahead. - Can you pull up in the front? - Mm-hmm. All right, we're here. My name is Kai. In Hawaiian it means "the sea." Oh, that's very beautiful. You're from Hawaii? Yes. My name is Fha. It means "sky" in Thai. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Fha. How's business been tonight? You're my first customer. I just started my shift. - If you don't mind my asking... - Mm-hmm? How much do you make on an average Friday night? I would say 1,500 baht, and 2,000 on a good night. Sixty dollars? Yeah, I think so, yes. I have an offer for you. If you decide to take it, you'll have to turn off the app. Okay. I have four more stops after this one, all in the city. One-thousand dollars, that's the deposit. You can quit anytime, take the money. But if you decide to stay with me until the end, I'll give you $5,000 in cash. You don't have to do anything. You don't even have to get out of the car unless you want to. I just need you to drive for me. I need to go up and talk with a lawyer. Wait for me here. When I get back, I'll answer any questions you may have. All right? Thank you. Thank me at the end. Hello. - Forty-third floor. - Thank you. You're welcome. - Good evening, Mr. Kahale. - Good evening. - How was your flight? - It was quick. That's nice. Khun Cha Cha is actually waiting for you. Thank you. Welcome to Bangkok, Mr. Kahale. Thank you so much, Khun Cha Cha. Sorry to keep you waiting. - Not at all. Please, have a seat. - Thank you. You have a beautiful office. Seems like you've done quite well, especially for being so young. Yes, I have. So please, tell me. How I can be of service? You were a bit vague on the phone, something about an accident and a family member? Yes. Actually, more than just one family member, the whole family. Let me show you something. Thank you, Khun Cha Cha. I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you again for waiting. Not a problem at all. Did everything go okay? - Very well. - Good. I'll be back tomorrow around 4:00 pm to follow up with details. All right. - Would you please do me a small favor? - Of course. It's a bit unusual. Uh, can you please ask for a taxi, and specifically, a pink one? I know it's silly. But I saw a lot of the pink taxis at the airport, and with all my travels, I've never ridden in one. - Sure, yeah. - Okay, thank you. Now, please let them know there'll be two stops: one at a 24-hour supermarket, and then at my hotel, the Hotel Millennium. Okay, that's not a problem at all. It'll take maybe about ten minutes. Would you waiting here? Or... - Uh, actually, I prefer waiting outside. - Okay. Um, I think my body could use some fresh, non-airconditioned air. - Yeah, okay. Great. - Thank you again. Have a good evening. Thank you. Oh, my gosh, you scared me. Sorry, you should lock the doors. Everything went well? - The lawyer was very cooperative. - Well... I don't like lawyers. It's okay, I don't either. So, where next? Thonglor Police Station, please. I know, first a lawyer, now police. Mm-hmm. Are you in trouble? No, it's nothing like that. The lawyer and the police officer were working on a case that involved my daughter and her family, recently. I'm here to repay them. We're gonna get there around 11:00 pm. Will you be able to see them then? I'm sure that won't be a problem. Man, you fall asleep so easily. Every moving vehicle. I find I like the motion. What do you like to do when you're not... driving or taking care of your brother? I don't know. I don't really have much time to do anything else. You must like something. Well, what about you? Fishing. I like fishing. - Fishing? - Fishing. Fishing sounds so boring. Have you tried it? No, but I know what it is, and it looks boring. Fish are like people. - Like people? - Like people. How? Well, there are some fish that are... really dumb and easy to catch. Others are extremely smart, and much more difficult to catch. And then there are the rare, dangerous ones... that can hurt or even kill you. I actually find it relaxing... the act of fishing. I don't really care whether I catch a fish or not. I just like standing on a beach... watching the waves roll in... listening to them crash on the sand... feeling the warm breeze on my face... smelling the salt... and the scent of flowers in the air. That's how I fish. That's what my grandfather taught me. That's what I like. It's heaven to me. It sounds very peaceful. You should try it. Maybe one day. We're here. Do you want me to park in front? - Yeah, park in front. - Okay. I'll be back soon. What the fuck? I know you speak English. This is for Lisa. Who the fuck is... You're still here. To be honest, I thought about leaving. You saw I left the bag. Did you open it? But you know there's cash inside? Was it a test? Oh, my God! What happened to your head? I tripped. Hit the wall. You need stitches, maybe three or four. No, I'm fine. Thank you. Are you sure? That's a deep cut. I'm sure. All right. Breathe. And, no, it wasn't a test. Everything in life is about making choices. I chose to leave the bag. You chose not to take it. Life is about making choices and dealing with those consequences. You understand that? I understand. Are you hungry? Let's get something to eat. We have some time. What do you feel like eating? Something local. Well, I know just the place. Okay. I mean, come on, babe, who fucking kills a lawyer on a Friday night? Stop it! You're on the scene? I'm actually just walking in now. Kai Kahale, American-Hawaiian. Just arrived today, he came straight here. He had an appointment. She led him to the Vic's office, next thing you know he asks for a taxi, she finds her boss shot dead. Boom, a bullet to the head. He walked out of here as if it was nothing. Guards confirmed it as well. Like I said, cold-blooded. Body slumped over. Blood splattered everywhere directly behind her. This Kai Kahale sat directly in front of her and shot her. I'm looking at his ID. Seems to be real. Arrived this evening, 5:00 pm, from Haneda. TG 614, business class. Connecting flight. No alias? Kai Kahale, born 1954. Retired. Worked as a supervisor at a coffee plantation. Big one, it seems. He shot her with a silencer, one shot. He's definitely not an office worker. Get his picture out. Send it out to the airports and the borders. Who knows? Maybe we'll get lucky. All right, get as much information as you can and drop me off at the office. I left my car there. Uncle, two of the usual, please. Sure. What would you like to drink? Uh...? I'd recommend you the chrysanthemum tea. It's really refreshing. Yeah? - Perfect. - Perfect. Uncle, two chrysanthemum tea, please. Go ahead. - Thank you. - Customer or boyfriend? - He's a customer. - That's good. Because he looks even older than your Dad. Here you go. Thank you. You're a regular here? Yeah, I try to come here two or three times a week, depends on my ride. Good? Good. Can I ask you a question now? Anything. Six thousand dollars is a lot of money, and anyone would do it for half or even less. Probably. But why 6,000? Because I wanted you to say yes. And I wanted you to want to do it and be happy doing it. Okay... But, to be honest, I can just take half. It's more than enough for me. No, we made a deal. We shook on it. - Are you sure? - Yes. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. As I said, thank me after. After what? Oh, no, no, wait. You need to put some of this in first. Some nuts. Some... I don't know what you call this in English. But it will make it taste good. Do you eat chili? I do. Thank you. And then you need this, this is like the secret recipe. - Fish sauce. - Fish sauce? Okay, done, dig in. Bon appétit. - Bon appétit. - Merci. Mmm, smells so good. It's good, right? It's really good. Great. So, what's after this? After. We have a stop at a club. - Mm-hmm. - Then we go to a hospital. And the last stop is at a house. You're meeting five people today? No, seven. And you want to know why. Yeah, sorry. It's okay, human nature. Not too long ago... my daughter and her family came to Thailand. They got into an accident. The people I'll be seeing tonight were involved with it. I see. Are they okay? No. They died. Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. It's okay. I was recently in an accident as well. White family... They died too. Drunk driver. Happens everywhere in the world. They have a kid. A child. I'm sorry. Thank you for bringing me here and for paying for dinner. - It was excellent. - You're welcome. And, uh, I'm sorry about the not so happy conversation. It's okay, it's life. Uh... Do you know the Ibiza night club? Yeah. Is that our next destination? - Yes. - Okay. A cross. You're not Buddhist? No. I'm not Christian either. Are you atheist? What's atheist? Atheist is someone who does not believe in religion. I believe in faith. I believe it's good that people have faith. Do you pray? Yeah. May I ask to whom? To my parents. So why the cross? It belonged to someone I knew. I kept it as a reminder. Good or bad reminder? Good. Of something bad I did. You did something bad? Yeah. Did anyone get hurt? I don't think so. But you feel bad. Yeah, I feel... I-I don't know how to explain. Guilt. You feel guilty. Guilt is good. It reminds us to do good. That's why I kept the cross. Drive around. Stay close. I'll call, don't pick up the phone. Meet me over there, past the entrance, within five minutes of the phone call. Okay. Okay. What the fuck, man? - Dominic! - Holy fuck! You messed up. Stay put. What... What do you... What do you want? You killed a family with your Porsche. Do you remember? Do you remember?! - Yes, yes, yes, yes... - I-I remember. Just don't... don't... don't do anything. Stand up. Wait, no, don't... Just don't kill... Jesus Christ! - Stand up! - Okay... I didn't do anything! Do you want... Do you want my car? Take it, man, it's yours. - What happened? - Drive. - What did you do? - Drive, please. - Where's the nearest hospital? - Are you hurt? I'm okay. Hospital? There's one a few minutes away. Take us there, please. Please! What are you thinking? I'm thinking there's more. I'm thinking that it's going to escalate. And I'm thinking he's not sleeping in a hotel somewhere. We need to get everything on these three people. Wife's on it. She should have something for us soon. Isn't your son like a week old? - Nine days. - Talk about a slave driver. You met my wife, right? You know she doesn't rest. Speak. All right, thanks. Seems like you're right again. - Where? - Ibiza Night Club. Twenty-three-year-old, shot through the chest. Witness all claim old Asian man. - All right. - Wait, boss, there's more. The kid, he's not dead. He's being transported to the hospital as we speak. You go to the club, get a positive ID, take a look around, - and I'll head over to the hospital. - Copy that. Can I have a tissue, please? Thank you. I'm not going to kill you. Nothing has changed. Our deal is still the deal. It wasn't an accident, right? Me picking you up tonight? No, it wasn't. I know where you live. I knew your routine. Why? The family that died in your car? That was my daughter... her husband... and her five-year-old daughter. My grandchild. You gonna kill me? It was possible... yes. It was your car, your signature on the witness sheet. I swear, I don't want to kill you. I don't even want to hurt you. Can you give me a bottle of water, please? Thank you. Drink it. What changed your mind? That. I gave that to my daughter... on her 18th birthday. Anyone who can live with as much guilt as you do... over making a choice... You had no option. That person has a good heart. You're going to kill him? Yes. What kind of fucking place is this? - Is this you? - What the fuck do you mean? Is this one of your business associates? Did you have some sort of deal go bad? Fuck you! Fuck you for even thinking that. How can I not think it? How many times have you put us in danger? - Really? - Yeah. How many times have you been shot at? How many times has Dom? That's right, none. I have never put us in danger. The life I provide you with, ninety-nine percent of the population would kill for. So, I would appreciate some respect! The fact that I let you fuck your little hussies is respect enough. What, you think I don't know? You think I'm some farang who's blind and doesn't know what's going on? Nothing you do goes by me. I can take my son and walk away with everything you got. I know all your dirty little secrets. So the fact that I'm still standing here, that's all the respect you're going to get. And if my son dies... I swear to God, you'll regret the day that you ever laid eyes on me. He's a lucky boy. The bullet went clean through. All they had to do was clean his wounds and stitch him up. He's gonna be okay. You're fired... useless piece of shit! You fucking shot my son?! Wait, wait, wait! What is this all about? Listen, anything you want. I have so much money. Your money paid for everything. Made my son-in-law into a criminal. Covered your son's crimes! Yeah, you understand now. I did it to protect my son. Something any father would do. Me too. The apple never falls far from the tree. He's just a kid. You're old enough to kill... you're old enough to die. - Well, what do you got? - Hurt boobies. Like father, like son. I found connections between the cops and the lawyers in over 20 cases, from small traffic violations to much more serious crimes. Example? Drug and human trafficking, possession. You name it, they worked on it together. And for every instance, the defendants walked. There was only one case involving the Davis family, though. Okay. A few months ago, the son was involved in an accident. Four people died and one was injured, including a five-year-old girl. A British family. - Not American? - No, British. - The Coopers. - And the son got acquitted. Turns out the husband was the one who was driving the taxi. Paid the driver extra, said he always wanted to drive in Bangkok. Got confused, drove right onto coming traffic. And ran directly into the son. Yeah, that's the official version. No thanks to our two dead friends, I'm sure. Right. Your thoughts? My thoughts are the same. The law is the law. Vigilante justice is still homicide. Drop it! Now! Okay, man, relax. I'm putting down the gun. Look, I know everything. The son, he killed your family, right? Son or daughter? My daughter. I understand, but no one needs to get hurt anymore. Oh, yes, one more person. Then it's done. The only person that is gonna get hurt is you... if you continue this. Put down the gun. Come on, man, let's handle this the right way. The legal way. Yeah, that didn't work out too well for my daughter and her family. And that's on us, and I apologize. But there's good and bad everywhere. Yeah. They were bad people pretending to be good. You are good doing bad, and two wrongs don't make it right, man. Nothing will make this right, not even this. - So why are we doing this? - Because I can. Because no one else did. Don't. I don't want to shoot you, I don't want to shoot her, but I will. Stay there. Go, go, go! Go. No! Kai! No, fuckin' stay there! Kai, you're not gonna shoot me. - I will shoot you! - Let her go. I'm not letting her go. I'm not letting her go! Kai, please let her go. She didn't do anything. I don't want to hurt her! I don't have a gun. Kai, calm down. That's not you, you're not that type of man. - They're already dead. - Stay there! Kai, they're all dead. Let her go, please. - I'm begging you. - I'm gonna shoot you. I'm gonna shoot you. I'll shoot you. Kai, let her go! You want to shoot me, then shoot me, but you fucking let her go now! That's not you, Kai! Let her go! Okay? I'm a father, just like you. Just like you, I'm a father, I understand, but please, just let her go. Please. Kai... Kai, listen to me. Let her go. No! That's on you! That's on you! No! Help! Help me! Officer down! Two down! Come on, bro, hang in there, hang in there. I didn't kill her, right? No, you didn't, she's good. She's going to make it. Okay. Fuck! Fuck. This is a surprise. Where are you? I don't know. There are cops everywhere. Yeah, I know. Didn't go quite as well as planned. Send me your location. They don't know my car, I'm close. I'll come pick you up. All right. Park in the alley. I'll see you when you pull up. Stay low. Thank you. Where are we going? You're bleeding, we need to fix you. I'm fine. Bullet went through. - How do you know? - I felt it. But I can't go to a hospital. I'm serious. The detective, he's good. It won't take him long before he figures out who the last target is. And the last target himself? He's gonna know what's going on in the next hour... and disappear. We're not going to the hospital, don't worry. It's not too far away. Thank you. How are you holding up? Better. You did your best. I heard everything. Kid was 29. He shot a nurse. She was 24. He's not a kid. There's another target. I know. That's why I'm here. You remember the accident? There was one person who was injured, didn't die. Her name was Vanida Hoffsted. She was a Grab driver. The girl that testified at the trial. Yeah. Earlier tonight, she picked up someone from On Nut Road around 8:00 pm. Two hours later, dropped him off on Silom Road. Near the law offices? Well, where is she now? She turned her app off after that. She was driving a new Volvo. I have the plates. We can track her. It'll show up if she's on the road. - Put everything on it. - I already ordered it. Of course you did, babe. - You saw the photos. - Stop. I know you're a good-hearted person... but he's still a cold-blooded murderer. He never was one. He served in the military; two tours, 40 years ago. After that, not even a single blemish. Not even a traffic violation. He's still a murderer. He's also a father. Just like you. What are you trying to say? I should just drop everything? No, but I know you. You just watched your young partner get shot and die. You're operating on emotions right now. I'm just here to give you some balance. You're a good man, like him. I don't want to see you do a bad thing. Two wrongs don't make a right. I gotta go work. Look at him. Now look at me. You're a good cop, babe. But remember, you're a father now, first and foremost. Then a husband, then a cop. - I love you. - Ditto. Oh, my God. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Uh, do you have some saline or some alcohol - or something first? - Oh, right, yes. Oh, fuck. - All right. Oh, thanks. - Sorry. Oh, my gosh, that's a lot of blood. Okay... Are you ready? Okay, this is gonna hurt. Why'd you come back? Sorry. I had a chance to correct the wrong that I did. So I made a choice. You said we live with the consequences of our own choice. I made a bad one before. You didn't have a choice. I know that now. Ow. Okay. They gave me two million baht... and this car. They told me to say that I wasn't the one who was driving. That our car hit the other car. If I didn't take the offer... I believe that they were probably going to kill me. Yes. They would have. I spent most of my money on my brother. Paid in advance for his hospital expenses. There's not much left now. Well, turn around, you've got one more to go. Ooh. This is gonna hurt more. All right, last one. Take a deep breath. Thank you. It's gonna leave a big scar. It's okay. It's a good reminder. Of what, tonight? Of you. Jack of all trades. I actually have one more reason why I came back. I started driving two years ago. Before this, I used to work in hotels and restaurants. I meet a lot of foreigners everywhere I work. All the foreigners, they see me, they like me. They offered money for me to sleep with them. But I never take it. You understand? You're the first man that I've met... in my life that's showed me respect. Who actually gave me respect for what I do, my work. Not for what I look like. That's why I came back. That's the nicest thing anyone has said to me since... my wife. It's the truth. Makes it nicer. Stay here. Hold this. There's $4,000 cash in this bag. It's yours. Do you know Bitcoin? Bit... coin. Yeah, I think so. You know it's money? Like electronic money. I read something online, but I'm not sure. Okay, it's not hard to find out about. Inside that bag is a hard drive. My life savings. One-million, three-hundred and eighty-nine thousand dollars. It's yours. - No, no, no, no, I cannot take this. - No, no, no. Listen to me. - No, no, I cannot. No. - Listen to me. Listen to me. I converted it to bitcoin. I didn't know what else to do. Uh, I was thinking, maybe I could donate it to charity afterwards, but there is no afterwards for me. What do you mean? I mean, the last guy is different from the others. He's much more dangerous. Much smarter. Better guarded. So you think you cannot win? It was never about winning for me. Even if I survive, I'll go to prison. I should go to prison. But I can't go there, you understand? I understand. So you must take this. Because if you take this, you win. And if you win, I win. You take your brother and you get some passports. And you take him to some country that doesn't speak Thai, if that's what you really want. Okay? Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Who is this man? He's Japanese. - Like Yakuza? - No. But he works with them. He works with anyone who can pay his price. Which is... very high. To do what? To solve problems. Like? Like, if you kill someone and you need to get rid of the body. If you get arrested for drunk driving, killing a family... he can fix it. He's a really bad man, then. One of the worst. A type of person who can do a lot of bad things and not get dirty for it. Well, you seem to know a lot about him. I hired him. What? He arranged everything for me. The bag, the gun, the phone, everything. Oh, well, you're really smart, Mr. Kai. Don't go. Make a choice. Take me and my brother to Hawaii. We can go fishing. That would be nice. Fishing with you... and your brother. Good luck... Khun Fha. Hey! Hey, you motherfucker! You got all these guys fighting for you, you can't do it yourself? Huh? One guy. One guy! Huh? You fucker! Come out! Come out! You, deal with me, old man! Tough guy! Come here, fuckhead! Huh? You want me to come inside? I'll fucking come inside. I'll find you. Hold on a second. You're really aggressive. You've got nice hair. I admire you, I really do. You know, it's impressive what you've done here tonight. Well, I'm not finished yet. And I'm only getting started. As you know, I don't usually involve myself personally in anything. I like to manipulate things. But I'm really gonna enjoy this. It's been a long time since I killed anyone. You shot a 22-year-old boy. That's cold-blooded, dude. Yeah, well... I'm not done yet. You Hawaiian man. They certainly don't make 'em like you anymore. You're pissed at me because I helped some rich parents get their son off. I didn't kill your family. They'd be dead if I stepped in or not. So is this all worth it? Yeah. It's worth it. Maybe. I took my shot. Now you take yours. Come on! Ow, fuck! Shit. Goddamn. Kai! I should just shoot you. Kai, Kai... It's me. Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? You're the cab driver. She's not involved. Wait, you actually care about her? She took bribe money. Yeah, you didn't give her a choice. True. Details. Let her go. How the fuck are you still standing? Please... let her go. I'm gonna have to say no. But I'm gonna be a nice guy. I'm gonna give you a choice. Who do I shoot first? Sorry. Me too. Her. Wise choice. Is this on me too? I'm sorry about the cop. And the nurse. She has all the evidence to clear my family's name. Please do it. I held her hostage. I threatened her brother. I forced her into this. Please, call an ambulance. I already have. I'm dead. You know that. I know I don't deserve it... but I have a request. Thank you.
