But no money, no action. Whores! But something's got to be done. How will the shoot continue otherwise? It is the first day of your son's career. You're the producer and your son, the director. If the star doesn't show up, it will be so humiliating. Become anything, but not a producer. I swear! It's like one is made the sacrificial goat all the time. Don't get upset. Go and talk to him calmly Give him 2 million and say that... ...3 million will follow the day after tomorrow. Take this. - Okay. Hello. Ok, listen... No you listen to me. I can't do it. But this phone call... - I had to. I didn't have a choice. I cannot pay 10 million. Please! You've got the wrong man. No... You're the right man. You are the godfather... Even Rasul said that you were the one to talk to. I can't pay more than 4 million. - 4 million!? Okay, 5. In cash! I cannot pay more than that. We don't even have to meet... But please spare my dance bar. Tonight at 11 pm, Horniman circle. You will find the cash in the garbage bin there. Hands up. - I haven't done a thing! Sir, we found the phone. Sir, I haven't done a thing! I'm not involved in all this. That's always the case, isn't it? One guy is the brain... Another guy is the brawn... And you are the ass. Write this down: As per the rules, we fired the first shot... ...in the air. From there. Mark it. Bajaj fired a retaliatory shot... Mark that too. Then Bajaj started running. I'm not running! I'm not running. We chased him. Hey, run after him. Then, as per the rules, we fired at his legs. But he kept running. - No, I'm standing still... ...And kept firing at us Write this bit in capital letters. It's the medal-clincher... One of his shots hit our constable. Now write the name of the constable... Hey, who wants a medal this time? Sir, it is my turn now. C'mon over. No Sir, not here. The medal will come here... Fire at his shoulder. Sir, I carry my kids on my shoulders. Fire at his leg. - But how will I go out to fetch the milk? Will the hand do? But I'll need it to accept 'under the table' bribes? Should I shoot you in the head? Then your wife can... ...collect the medal. Shut up and turn around. Sorry sir. Write: The bullet hit Ghorpade in the thigh... And then as per the rules, we fired at Bajaj. No sir! Sir, I have a wife and kids. Please let me go. I have a family. Sir, I have a lot of money. You can take what you want. - Hey! What do you think? All policemen aren't for sale... But some are. Like me! "Create your own destiny..." This is for the fake uniform. This is for the fake policemen. And this for the police vans. Thank you, boss. And this is yours Omar. I've heard a lot of praise about you, Roy. Dog, swine, beep... beep... Everyone says the same thing about you. Everyone warned me not to trust you. That's why I came prepared. Omar, people short on brains need bullets. Put it down. If you strain your finger... ...it'll be hard to count the bills. Take that away. What will you do with all this money? I'll use some to stuff a pillow... ...some for the blanket. I'll sleep with it and wake up with it. It's all thanks to you... Er, that's enough! No boss, you're the best! The best! That I am.

Tina, money isn't everything. But love... that's something. 18000 rupees? On a man you met barely 18 times! Madam, these negatives are really old, and damaged. That's why it costs more. - It's okay. Excuse me one minute. Simmi! Think about how you could spend those 18000 rupees... Some new outfits, ten visits to the beauty parlour... ...six pairs of shoes You spent your money on what made you happy, right? Now consider this. If Roy likes these photos, how happy would I be... Please... what syrupy lines. Look, you never know with men. At least the shoes will last six months, maybe more. No, Roy is not like that. I trust him completely. He is a very decent and straight forward guy. Where did you find these? In your house, when we were cleaning. I thought I'd make you some re-prints. You don't like them, do you? I knew it. Tina was right. I should've got you something else. No. It is not that... They are really very nice. But I hope you didn't spend a lot of money on them. No! Not at all... Thank god! Why? Because they're not mine, they're my roommate's. Roy! So you did spend a lot. Right? I was just kidding. They're mine. Roy... Thank you! But why did you bother? For this stupid smile of yours. Sim, I've never been given such a wonderful gift. Thank you. It's no big deal. It's just a few old photos. They're not just any photos. It's my childhood you brought back to me... I hope your friend isn't a stock broker like you? Otherwise, we'll spend the evening... ...analyzing stock prices and the sensex He was a stock broker. But not any more. He did well for himself and got out. Don't worry. I think you'll like them both, him and his wife. Is it a girl or boy? Both... and they are planning to adopt 2 more! My friend loves children. It's beautiful! - Isn't it? He retired at the right time. Now his wife is his life. You never told me about them earlier. Are they very close to you? Yes, very close. Come on, I'll introduce you. I love you, Simmy. I know we've known each other for just 6 months. But since the first day I saw you... ...you've been on my mind constantly. I can't see beyond you... So... Marry me... please!

Yes, it's Sardarji... yes, it's Jassi... You at the office? I've got the agreement and the cash. Yes... cash... cash... Why has it stopped now? Isn't there a standby generator? Isn't there an alarm? See if there is an alarm. I don't find any such thing. What have I got myself into? Is anyone there? There's no reason to panic; I'm here, aren't I. I'm stressed out and you're playing the hero. Just Chill! I'll get you out of here. He's opened it! ...He's like Superman... a real saviour! Give me your hand. - Who are you talking to? - You! First give me your bag. - He's asking for my bag. Be careful... ...otherwise I'm in big trouble. Thank God! I am through. Give me your hand. - Ask for the bag. No, give me your bag first. Go ahead... he's trustworthy after all... Hey, what are you doing? Shut your mouth. If you move, you'll be chopped in two. Do you think I am a fool? I'd figured out your plan... You think I'll give you my bag so you can take off with it? Listen brother, you've misjudged me. I don't even know this Sardar. Shut up. I'm the Bill Gates of this kind of technology. Meaning... you're one of us? We're finished! You're Aditya Shrivastav - Call me Dittu. Shut up and give me your other hand. Dittu, leave it. Let's go home. It is no fault of yours. You're leaving me sandwiched here? Jassi! Do something. Next time, aim at the prey and not the hunter. Jassi, help! Get me out of here. Cash or card? No, 2 more cups of coffee. You have ordered 10 coffees in the past 6 hours. Yes, the coffee here is very good! But you haven't drunk any. I didn't find anyone to drink it with. You can't just sit here like this. Okay. This is getting really silly now. What!? I'm enjoying the view. What view? There is nothing to look at. Stop it! Sometimes a person may not like the view. That's normal. But it's the first time I've come across a view... ...that does not like a person. Roy, what do you want? Forgiveness. - You won't get that. Okay, how about a cup of coffee. I don't drink coffee. No problem. We can order tea. Look Roy, I work here... please leave. Go ahead and wrap up your work. We'll leave together. Enough, Roy. Don't create a scene! Just get out! Is there a problem, Sir? No sir. He was just about to leave. I have to meet someone for tea. I'll leave as soon as that's done. Oh! That's fine. One last cup. Tonight 8 o'clock. After that you go your way, I go mine. - See you. "You are King Kong... You can do it!!!" "You are King Kong... You can do it!!!" You are about to die. No, you have no time... No, you have very little time left. Are you a doctor? I am a doctor. Dr. Bhalerao. I have to speak at a conference on hypochondria. It is a very dry subject. I like to warm up with a joke... Can I try this joke on you? Just a minute! It goes like this. A patient goes to the doctor. The Doctor says, "You will not live long." The patient asks how long? The doctor says five. The man screams "Five... what five?" "Five years?" The doctor says no. "Five months?!" The doctor says no. "Five weeks?" No! The patient asks how much time he has. The doctor counts down... 5,4,3,2... 1. Done! You're done! Didn't you like it? My God, what should I do now? Calm down, okay. Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen! I am Dr. Bhalerao, I am going to talk about hypochondria. It is just the cover for my spects. Agreed... bye. Relax! Relax! Down! Down! It's war... bombs... W're being attacked. By Bangladesh! There's gun shots! Down! Get down! Wait! You are hurt! You were hit by a bullet. - Where? Look... blood. Its is your own blood! Lallan! Lallan! You idiot, lift this man up. Where am I? - On top of me. What happened? A bullet hit you. O God! Call an ambulance. We don't have a phone. Use mine. Take my card from my wallet... call the hospital. Tell them that Dr. Bhalerao has been hit... they must hurry. Tell them it's an emergency. I need a handkerchief to stop the bleeding. We will do that later. Easy! Easy! But I can't feel any pain. I don't feel anything. In that case it's no point. Let's go home. Try now. - Okay. Where is the bullet wound? - Here. Let me look at it. Don't do that. You won't be able to bear it. Check my pulse. Where's the watch to time the pulse? - Here. My son, what's your name? - Lallan. Lallan, please loosen my tie. It is very tight. Please do it slowly. What's that noise? - Nothing. I hear some strange noises. - What noise? I do hear some strange noises. That's the sign of your mind losing control... before death. Got it! The ambulance is here! What we must do is... - I am a doctor. I know it. Please take care of yourself. Okay. Lallan! Take care of my briefcase. Because I don't trust anybody. Purse... Hey, bring the stretcher! Take deep breaths... Breathe in! Breathe out! Will I... will I make it? You will. But I can't say the same about your shirt. They did a post-mortem on you and left. Police! Police! Come with me, you are my witness! Relax. Forget the police, I'll tell you... ...where to find them. Sim, I know I made a mistake. But that life is behind me now. I've changed. I will do exactly what you say. I've even returned all of Mr. Bajaj's money. You know you're so lucky we didn't press charges. Otherwise you would be in jail right now. I don't think so. I would have escaped just to meet you. I can't live without you, Sim. And I can't live with you, Roy. You're not able to forget any of it? I am trying to forget... you... It's not going to be possible. Because you love me. Do you even know what love is? There are no lies and betrayal in love. But you obviously don't know anything about that. Roy, each time you cheat one person... ...a lot of people suffer. This time our relationship suffered. You're capable of deceiving anyone you like... But if you think that we'll ever be together again... ...you're only deceiving yourself. Sim! - Thank you!!! Thank you!!! It's because of you that I recovered my stuff! I told them not to mess with me. The ketchup guy escaped, but his partner was caught! I am Bhalerao. Dr. Bhalerao. Holy Spirit hospital. For everything from a cold... ...to AIDS, I'll treat you free of charge. I'll get this one for you. Waiter! Hey you... who claims to be my father. Hello, papa! Boss. I'm sorry... It was a very serious accident. We had to amputate both your legs. Otherwise your life would have been in danger. Are you back to your senses? You! - You recognized me? I thought you forget people after you ruin their lives. It's bound to hurt if you pour a gallon of diesel... ...into your pint-sized petrol tank. Why do you drink so much when you can't hold your alcohol? I didn't drink so much. Everyone says the same thing the morning after. Anyway, I should have let that car run you over. Why did I bring you here? But what can I do? I have a big heart... I can't see anyone in pain... Neither a friend... nor even an enemy. Thanks to you I'm down 40,000 My partner's arrested, and... The police are on my trail. Even my jeans are torn. This is the sort of thing... ...that would make Snow White into the evil step-mother. But what did I do? I took you home, took care of you, gave you my bed... Sacrificing my own sleep, so that you could sleep. I'm the evil Step-mother who became Snow White. Thank you... I am very sorry. But that doctor just wouldn't let go of me... I would like to cover your losses. What will you recover? My money... my friend. My jeans... my time... my sleep? What all will you pay for? My pity for you... that brought you here? Can you pay for that? I have promised. Stuff got messed up because of me... I want to set it right... Please! What will you set right now? You're just the wrong kind of person to bother about. My life isn't always going to be this way... My day will come. Boss... boss... I'm trying to apologize... ...but you're hammering on at me. Forget the money. Tell me what you really want and I'll do it. Really!? Partners? Don't think so. Ok, you are the guru and I the devoted student. Happy? Think about it boss! All the great people in our line of work... Started off as partners. - Like? Bonnie and Clyde... Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid... Give me Indian names. Billa and Ranga? They were murderers! Jai and Veeru? They were fictional. Give me real names. Raman and Raghav! Raman Raghav was one guy. That's why he got caught. That's my point! You've got to listen to students sometimes... Why are you sitting sideways? Sit straight. I have a revolver with me. It needs space... ...so that nothing goes wrong. If it goes off, it'll blow a hole in your side. Now listen carefully! Lesson number 1. In our profession we don't use guns or bombs or knives... All we use is... - Money! The brain. - Right! And that's always with you, always loaded. Only those people who don't use their brains use bullets. Guru, please... Show me how it's done. The trick! The trick does not lie in how you con someone. The trick is choosing who to con. - What do you mean? You must have heard that it is very difficult... ...to fool an honest person. Yes, that can be hard. Lesson no. 2 What I just said is rubbish. Exactly! What!? There is nobody in the world who cannot be fooled. Meaning... rich or poor, big shot or small fry, fat or thin... If the bait is well-hooked... The fish show up on their own. Look around you, Dittu. This world is an ocean. And man is a fish. The problem is that most of these fish are all dried up. You can chew all you want but you'll stay hungry. So it's better to leave those alone. First is the 'Maandli'. 'Maandli' are those small ones. Yes, I know them. They taste great with a drink. But you need at least 15 or 20 to feel full. Right... Maandli. To fill your pockets you need 15 or 20 of them. And that guy... what type of fish is he? He is a Goldfish. Flashy on the outside, but really, a struggler. Cheap cigarettes in an expensive pack! So which fish are we interested in? In Mumbai, the Bangda Is a popular fish. Sales executives, marketing executives... ...9 to 6 office-going types... If you get into that scene... ...you will have to work hard everyday. The daily grind is not my scene. I'd rather... ...catch a big one and chill out the rest of the month. Then the Pomfret's the one for you. TV stars, doctors, lawyers, bosses of small companies etc. If you rob them then you can take a month off. And what if I want to chill out for a year? The whale then... Big industrialists, stockbrokers and the like. They rule the world like the whale rules the ocean. So why don't we go for the whales right away? They are out of your reach... Whales don't wander the streets or take buses or cabs! So forget it. So we'll have to manage with the pomfret... You think you can manage even that? If you can't manage that much in Mumbai... ...then all you can do is eat cheap, and pray hard! Guru, what are we doing here? Today's menu features: Pan-fried Malhotra! Mrs. Malhotra? Good afternoon Madam. We're from the Standard Bank, Credit card division. This is a small gift for you from us. For me?! What for? As per our offer... Can you please open the door? You will just have to sign a few papers. Hey Boss, I thought that you would pull something big. But you seem to be a saint. If you don't dangle the bait how will you catch the fish? It's a lovely ring. - Not as lovely as you are. It must be expensive - It is worth Rs. 7500. Not a penny less or more. It's all part of the offer. But where is Mr. Malhotra? Mr. Malhotra! - Please come in. Mr. Malhotra! Mr. Malhotra, right this way, sir. Who are you? Excuse me! We did not order a ring. I know that. This is a gift from our bank as per the offer. What is this offer all about? You'll get a gift worth 5o/o of the total amount... ...you spend on this card. If this ring is worth Rs. 7500 it means... ...that you have made purchases worth 150,000. 150,000! - We did? - From your card? - Impossible! Is this your statement? Then this ring is yours. How could there be so much expenditure? Let me tell you the details. 12th July, Rs. 1440, dinner at Hotel Leela. 15th July, Rs. 12500, Mumbai - Bangalore by Jet Airways. On the 28th again a return ticket from Bangalore. Yes, for company work I do travel frequently to Bangalore. All the expenses should not be more than 25000. Let me see it. There's a lot more, sir. In Bangalore a carpet worth 3200 from Kashmir bazaar. A dining table set worth Rs. 35440, a double bed... ...and an easy chair from Indoor Furnishings. And Sleep well pillows and mattress worth 7400. You have a house in Bangalore too? Nice weather! Speak out... why don't you say anything? Ma'am, there's no reason to get upset. He's spent on the home... not a thing for himself. A maternity dress from Just Moms for 3000. A maternity dress! - You must have bought it for her. He bought a pram of Bonny Baby worth 13200. - A pram too!? By the way, ma'am I must say, you are in excellent shape... After the baby. Is it a boy or a girl? Why don't you call Bangalore to find out! Sunita, pack the luggage. Darling, it's all a misunderstanding. Don't leave, please. I'm not the one who's going - you are! To Bangalore, to her who on whom you spent 150000. And I get the ring worth 5o/o! I didn't buy all this stuff. They must have made a mistake. You don't have a second house in Bangalore? No. - No baby girl or boy? No! Not at all! Swear on your child and tell the truth. When I don't have a child, what do you want me to do? I think he is telling the truth, sir. Someone else is responsible. For the children? No... - The credit card fraud! Have we been robbed of 150000? You've been saved by the skin of your teeth. Your credit card is insured for 200,000. - Thank God! Sir, please show me your credit card. - Why? Give it to them. They are such nice people. Just as I thought. This has to be destroyed. Just sign here please. Your signature is very impressive! We're all set. - What?! Sir, I mean you're all set. "I don't want to drink tea." "I don't have the habit." "Since I am a lonely bird..." "...this trap has been laid out for me." "That's why my mother..." "...invited you over for tea" Thank you Mr. Malhotra. Let me remove the security tags. My looks may be 5 on 10. My physique... 7 on 10. But when it comes to style I'm 50 on 10! What do you think? A white cane and a tin cup is all that's missing. Take it off... This looks good. - Did you like anything? What do you think of this? - No. So go and get it for me then! That one's better. Why are you following me, Roy? I didn't follow you. I had some work here. Oh! So you are here for work! Will you show me something in gold? What are you today? A lawyer? A doctor? An Inspector? I came to tell you that you and that guy look great together. Okay, thank you! Like brother and sister. Amit is my fiance. Does he make you laugh? At least he doesn't make me cry. He can't make you laugh or cry... Which means he doesn't move you at all... And you're going to marry him?! Sim, I don't know how much he likes you. But I do know that no one can love you more than I do. I'm getting late. I've got to go. - Sim! You can go as far as you like... But I'll never be far from you. Give me one last chance. I've really changed. Mr. Malhotra, your bill is ready. Mr. Malhotra... Mr. Malhotra...! You have changed? Roy, do you know what your problem is? You will change not once, but over and over again. Move! Just a minute sir. Hey Roy! Perhaps you've forgotten to pay for something I haven't purchased anything. What do you want me to pay for? Roy! I'll get you! Larsen must have thanked Toubro some time... At least once. What's wrong with saying thank you just once? Guru... can I tell you something? That girl is not your type. I don't think you both fit. I mean, Gabbar may make Basanti dance all he wants... ...but he can't marry her, can he? Only Veeru can do that. Do I look like Gabbar to you? 100o/o. The way you were lying to that girl! 'Give me one last chance! I have really changed! ' She's got a place in your heart, that's obvious. But conning people is in your blood. You know what I'm saying. Sunil, its Roy. MH 14P 1713... Maroon Mercedes... I want the name and address quickly. I want popcorn and some sandwiches. And two glasses of something cold to drink. Listen. He is a senior Income Tax officer. Be careful, or this theatre will be raided. Hurry up. Sir, how was Mulchandani caught... ...Despite all his contacts? That is history now! His big contact landed him in big trouble. He warned him about the raid and advised him... ...to stash all his cash somewhere. Then...? The fool stashed the money in his neighbour's house. And where did the raid take place? In his neighbour's house! Hello... Namaste Yes sir... We're just watching a movie. A raid? No problem. It'll be done. 20-25 officers... Tell me the name and address. Hey, take it down. Pratish Shah! And his address? 1411, Gulmohar Building, Pali Hill. He has a Mercedes too! Don't worry, sir. He'll be begging for change for his bus fare after this! We'll be at his house at 3. I'll hang up now. The difficult part is over. Now the lamb will come to the butcher. He is going to enter the lift with his money... ...and we will take him for a ride!

This is the control center of the body. If it functions, we do. And we function only if it does. What do you mean? Chemo, surgery, lasers... what? None of that can help you. You're beyond treatment. There has to be something. We're in the 21st Century, damn it. Had we known earlier, we could have done something. But now... Now? What happens next? As the tumor grows... various organs will start to malfunction. Taste and smell are the first to go... your vision will blur... And when the tumor grows to here... ...it's your respiration... How much time do I have? You could ask for a second opinion. Come on doc, how long will I live? Three months. What happened to you, Boss? Wait a second! I found this card in your pocket and brought you here. Turns out this doctor is the one who was looking for me... ...so waited outside. Stop it! I've seen people pass out after drinking. But this is the first time... I've seen two pegs knock a man out. Stop it! Why? I'm the one who had to take care of you. It was like the Qutub Minar resting against the Taj Mahal. Didn't you hear me? Don't shout brother. You're my teacher and all but... It's a question of self-respect. Your lessons are done. Understood? You go now. I will see you tomorrow, okay? - Okay. Bye! - Bye, sweetheart. Roy, what are you doing here? Sim! Hi! Go home, Roy. You're drunk. But I am more sober than ever. Really! What do you want? They say that when God gives, he gives generously... But when he takes... - So what? I can trick any one. You're the one who said that. But how do I pull this off? - What do you mean? How do I trick Death? Sim... I'm dying! And I can't do anything about it. How can you stoop so low? What did you think? This melodrama would work? That I'd burst into tears and rush into your arms? Why would you believe me? Just stop it now He's my doctor. What are you paying him for this? If a cheat gets cheated, who cares, right? - Exactly! And even if this were true, I wouldn't be crying. Because I'm done crying over you. You're very lucky, Roy... very lucky. Anyone can count the days they have lived... But nobody knows how long they will live. Except for you, Roy. I hope you get to know that about yourself soon too. You don't understand... A famous poet once said: "O life, wait!" No. He said, "O life, stop!" Or was it "Sit." No, no. Life can't sit Mine is heading for the eternal sleep... Please, I have very little time left. Spare me. Sorry. I'm sorry. I forgot the poem. My daughter is very fond of poetry. She shared it with me. Urvashi... She is 22 years old. All the guys in college are crazy about her. She's very beautiful... my genes. Do you know when I found her most beautiful? The day she was born. I was right there in the delivery room. And they handed me this baby... all bloody and slimy... She was so beautiful. I will never forget that day. You must have many similar memories... Doctor, I'm not married, I don't have kids... ...and I will never have any. You don't understand, Roy. Look, Roy! Roy! You still don't get it. It's these precious moments that constitute a life. ...that transform the mundane into the unforgettable... When I was little... the first time that I rode a bicycle... ...my father ran alongside, holding the seat. Listen to me. He was running alongside... ...and I kept turning back, asking... 'Dad, are you there? Dad, are you there? ' He said 'You've got to look ahead... look ahead.' After a few moments I turned my head again to see... ...that he was standing quite a distance away, smiling. And I had learned to ride a bicycle. I'll never forget that day. Never. Do you understand me? The amazing thing is, I got to relive that day... Only this time I was holding the seat... ...and my daughter Urvashi was riding the bicycle. "No... no turning back... Look ahead. Look ahead.' 'Dad, are you there? Dad, are you there? ' And I let go. When she turned back and looked at me... ...she was smiling. Just like you are, Roy. Tell me, how many such days do you remember? Your first job! Your first suit! Our first salary! The first time you held a girl's hand? Your first kiss? Your first love? How many such days do you remember? Tell me! 15... 20... 25... 30? Thirty special days, right? You've lived 30 years and you remember just 30 days? What happened to the other days? Now, you have 90 days to live... You can kill that time thinking about death, Or you can live 3 lifetimes in those 90 days. Is he a parking valet or a Schumacher wannabe? Our hotel doesn't offer valet parking, sir. Follow that car, fast! "We can do anything we want" "We can achieve the impossible" "We can do anything we want" "We can achieve the impossible" "We can do anything we want" "We can achieve the impossible" "We can do anything we want" "We can achieve the impossible" Good afternoon! What type of fish are you, Boss? You've got to watch your back. If we were partners, this wouldn't have happened. I understood what your love story is. So you're following in Devdas' footsteps? He drank himself to death over Paro... For you, it's Simi. But you've got to be the first Devdas... ...who can't handle his liquor! Look boss, Devdas was an idiot! In his place, I would have said, 'Look Paro! Don't waste my time. If you're not interested... ...that's fine! There's no shortage of babes in Bengal! Rani Mukherjee, Kajol, Sushmita Sen... ...Bipasha Basu, Preity Zinta... Preity Zinta is not Bengali. So what! She's a succulent little Rasgulla all the same. My point is: The time he wasted drinking himself to death... ...he could have invested elsewhere. And then neither would he have died... ...nor would the film "Devdas" have been made. What do you want from me? What? You won't stop harassing me! Look, I'm no small fish. I'm a crocodile... Hurry up and tell me what you are after... I want to help a person who no longer recognizes me. Who doesn't even know my name... my Father! Dad... How are you? Dad... It's me, Dittu. This is my friend, Roy. Who are you? I don't know you. I'm not an orphan dad... Please... Recognize me. Who are you? Why are you bothering me? Take him away. He is in the wrong room. Take him to his father. Dad, I'm in the right place. I came to see you. It was a spare parts shop. His life's savings... 1.4 million... ...All gone. Dad was shattered. He didn't just lose money, he lost himself. He was broken. And you want revenge. He stole 1.4 million from my father. I will take everything he has. That man ruined your father's life... And this revenge game will ruin yours. Forget it. How can I forget it, pal? I'm not doing it for the money. I want my father back. Boss, I learned one lesson from my father. Each of us has that one thing we cannot afford to lose. You can lose everything else... ...but you must not lose not that one invaluable thing. You can spend your entire life in defense of it. For someone, that thing may be honesty, for another... ...it may be his work. For you maybe it's that girl. For me, it is my father. If I destroy that man, I'm sure I'll get my father back. Who is this guy? Chandrakant Parikh. Chandru. He conned a thousand others like he conned my father. He owns a hotel now. All shady deals are done inside. He's got his hands into every murky business. And his arrogance is beyond description. Sorry brother... Luckily, it's a small scratch. Don't worry... ...this is my mobile number. Get it fixed up at a garage. I'll pay. Please! Can I have your pen? - Sure! Sorry, brother. Luckily, it's a small scratch. Don't worry... This is mobile number. Get it fixed up by a doctor. I'll pay. Listen carefully The last and most important lesson. Understand your enemy... He's no small fry... he's a shark. He is fast, intelligent and very dangerous. Spread a net for him and he'll yank you in with the net. He cannot be caught from the shore... But he gets others caught. You can't con him like the others. I may not be able to... but you can. Cheque please. Hello sir! I'm Simran Ahuja. I'm interested in the Goa position. Please sit down. Sir, I have 4 years experience as a receptionist... I mean as a reception manager... ...a floor manager, a banquet manager... I've worked in all these departments. I've been in all the high positions at a 5-star hotel. So, how many more positions do you know? Sorry! Did I hurt your feelings? What can I do? That's my character... Stupid babe! If the job pays 75000 per month... ...it's not for her typing skills. Let's go. - Where? - Dinner We're going to fry him for our next meal. You're very lucky, Roy... very lucky. Anyone can count the days they have lived... But nobody knows how long they will live.

You know me, I... was lying. No. You're lying now. I met your doctor. I'm really sorry. How... could this happen...? Relax. I'm fine, really. I'm on medication... I've even got travel plans... Am going overseas. Overseas... in this condition? Yeah, usually people get all religious and start praying... I can't do all that. So I'm going to Disneyland. Disneyland!? Yes, Disneyland... Mickey Mouse... The Eiffel Tower... I'll go to Egypt and see the pyramids. I want to go to every destination in the travel agent's brochure. Are you going alone... or with someone? Why? You want to come along? Paris is very romantic! Roy! - Simmi! I don't think what you're doing is right. What if you're travelling and something happens to you? So what? I'm dying anyway. I'll Die in style... Simmi, I've figured it all out... What? Now isn't the time to die... it's the time to live. When are you off? Next week. All right then. I'll spend this entire week with you. Sorry madam, this week I'm busy. I'm going fishing. Before I go I want to hook the biggest fish. "We achieve whatever we want" "We are those who can achieve the impossible" If we don't watch films, how will we find a strategy? It's research, boss. Research! You'll find a strategy from these films? Haven't you heard? Films inspire crime... ...they give people ideas... all the world's crime originates... ...ln film... rape, murder... ...even cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. They... ...pick it all up from the movies. It's commonsense! It was September 5th, The location, MG Jewellers, Vasant Vihar, Delhi. In broad daylight, masked thieves got away with... ...jewellery worth 80 million and 1.2 million in cash... Leaving a trail of crime in their wake. What are you watching so keenly, boss? 15 days later, these dangerous criminals remain unidentified... ...and free, perhaps lurking in your very neighbourhood... ...planning their next crime. We are going to lend our names to their crime. Carry on. What sort of girls hang out in this lobby!? - Should I get rid of her? There is a certain way of doing that. Give me a one rupee coin! Are you out of your mind!? What are you doing?! I'm checking my weight. 72 kilos. It also says that today is good for travel. This is the list of marked bills. We are from the Maharashtra Police. Where are your bosses? Do you speak English? Who is this? How many times have I told you... Not to show your ugly face here? You want a bribe? It affects my customers. Sir, I'm not here for a bribe. So you've brought me a receipt for the previous bribe? Sir, the Delhi police has the word out... A jewellery shop in Delhi was cleaned out by two guys... ...and they're convinced those two are in Mumbai. Please let go of me, sir! This list has the serial numbers of the marked bills. So the manager can keep an eye out... and inform us... ...lf they try to show up here and use them. We will inform you if we know about them. What, sir? - We'll tell you if we find out about them. We'll inform you if we find out. If you know about the notes... - We'll inform you. If you find out... - We'll inform you. - Please inform us when you know. I was acting... otherwise he wouldn't have even touched me... He would be pulp. I can handle 15 men single-handedly! Forget it! Have a drink. What? - You guys are partying... We've just begun. We're nowhere near done! Look at him... Look at the state he's in after 5 minutes with Chandru... See what came of him! And we're going to have to practically live with Chandru! Idiots! He did his bit. It's our turn now. Right? - Yeah! The ball is in our court. We've got to do what we've got to do. Why did you put the table over me? Boss, don't worry. Here, have a sip. We have to be very careful. From today... ...till the day we're done, we must have no interaction... ...with the outside world. Tie up all your loose ends today itself. Sorry, boss. I'll never forget what you've done for me. One day I'll do something for you... I promise. I'll make your life. It's not a bad idea. Simmi, thanks for helping out. I'm glad you came... Really. It feels... good. Coffee? How did you become like this? What do you mean? I mean... in these photos, you look so sweet, and innocent. What happened? How did you get into this rotten world of cheating... ...and conning people, Roy? When I was in school... the kids wanted to be doctors or... ...pilots or firemen or engineers... or cops! And you? - Me? I wanted to be them all. I wanted do everything. Enough, Roy. You're not an actor, you're a criminal. Okay, so when the whole world does it, it's legal, But when I do it, I'm a criminal! You work for a criminal too, you know. Excuse me! I work in a hotel. So?? What happens in a hotel? If you want water, a bottle costs 100 rupees You want dinner? It's 250 rupees for a soup! And if you want to sleep, a night costs 5000 bucks Isn't the proprietor of your hotel ripping people off? There are taxes... Oh, I see! - That's true. Ah! Taxes! - Now you'll say... Taxes, VAT... it's all a con. Oh Roy! This is so ridiculous! Your way of seeing the world is so flawed. In your world people live just for money. In my world, there's friendship, bonding... love... Don't start on this love stuff now please... Yeah, I'm sorry Next you'll talk about adulteration in the milk... ...of a nursing mother. Right? It's not that, Simmi. But love...? Do you know what the biggest lie in the world is? - What? I love you! What!?? I love you! Three words that have ruined people... ...two at a time. Look at them... Today they are Romeo & Juliet ...but tomorrow they will be like Saddam & Bush. Really. Right now, it's all fine, but within 3 months 2 words... ...will remain. 'I 'and 'you'. 'Love' will have evaporated. That's what happens to love... The husband and wife sleep in each other's arms. But dream about someone else... The wife fantasizes about Brad Pitt. And the husband about Angelina Jolie. Seriously! The world is like that... that's reality. Each one is bluffing the next. If you get caught, you're out of the game. If you get away with it... you're the bluffmaster!! So... when you said you loved me, you lied? That was the truth, Simmi. The one and only truth. It's impossible to trust a bluffmaster like you... Who knows whether you're lying or not? What do you think? When I said 'I love you... ' ...was it the truth, or a lie? Yes, sir? - I want a room with a good view. Poolside, sir? Not poolside... roadside. I should be able to see... ...the entrance of the hotel from the window. - Okay sir. Who is this guy? He thinks he's God? He's our boss. The owner. He may own the hotel, but he's lost his mind! You were asking about the room. How many days do you want it for? - Days? Keep this. When it runs out, ask for more. Give them Room 23. They'll have the view they want. First come the cops, then the criminals, then the currency... ...now the fun begins. This way, sir... Here is your room. Tea, coffee, breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks... None of it! No knocks on the door early in the morning to make the bed. Nobody is to enter the room... ...even if they say I called them... Nobody is to enter. Do you know what this is? - A five hundred rupee note. No, it is the world's biggest 'Do not disturb' sign. We're acting alright, but where is our audience? I don't think Chandru's falling for it... I mean, he doesn't seem to be paying any attention to us. Over there, on the rooftop, those are Chandru's men. They're keeping an eye on us. Did we put on a good show? Chandru must be convinced... ...that we're the thieves. Gimme five. Mumbai Police! Don't move! I think we acted a bit too realistically? Shut up! Idiot! You're under arrest for attempted murder and robbery. Shut up and move! Bring them along. I don't know whether you know this or not. My threshold for pain is very low. Relax. When you say relax, I feel so much better... My confidence is being boosted. But don't relax too much. What did you say, you bastard? - Inspector, sir... This character's refusing to listen to me. I say something and they slap me around. - Shut up! How long will this yoga class last? What are you talking to him for? Talk to me. Where is the jewellery and the money? Tell me. Look, that's what I've been trying to tell you. Shut up, So, you're the boss. You tell me, where's the stash? The more you hit me, the more it's going to cost your boss. Is that so? Hit me once more, and the price doubles. If you don't free us in 5 seconds... ...the price doubles. You are so ugly that I feel like doubling the price anyway... Who do you think you are talking to? That, I don't know... But I know for sure that you're no cop. So run along, wagging your little tail and fetch your boss. Go now! Boss, did you really know that he wasn't a real cop? No... But I do know that Chandru is a cunning piece of work! I know it's all about computers these days... But I'm still a bit old-fashioned! This is my kind of lap-top. Shut up! Your eyes say a lot. They were abusing me. Look at me like that, and I'll end this game... and your life. If you want to talk for the sake of talking, go ahead... But... if you want to do business, then do that. ...if you want to shoot, go ahead and shoot... It's authentic stuff. Where is the rest? The rest? You pay with one hand, we deliver to the other. Too often the trailer's good... ...but the film's really bad. So don't buy a ticket. Let's go. 75 million. 100 million. Take your finger, clean the wax out of your ears... ...and listen carefully. I never go shopping with women... ...because they bargain too much and I don't like that. That was a good line. Make a note of it, it'll be useful. I've got to admit, boss... The expression on his face was priceless. He must have destroyed his laptop by now. We've got to reduce that bastard to nothing! Sim? What happened now? Is everything ok? Okay. Dittu, I've got to go... personal stuff. Do you watch Formula 1? Go ahead and take care of your stuff... I'll give them a tour of Mumbai. Stop the taxi! Turn it around. Follow him fast! I called off my engagement. I don't love Amit. I love you, Roy. Simmi, I don't have much time left... In the time that you have, I will squeeze in... ...a lifetime of happiness with you. Roy, didn't you say that this is a time to live, not to die...? "Come to me. Leave the world behind" "Come to me. We'll make our own space" "Come to me. Leave the world behind" "Come to me. We'll make our own space" "Listen up, girl. Just me and you" "And magic in the air" "A strange restlessness" "Let's leave nothing unsaid" "The only sure thing about time..." "...is that it will run out" "What if there's no tomorrow" "Let's leave nothing unsaid..." "...right here right now" "Is a time for happiness Wind your body one time" "Right here right now" "In this moment" "Try to forget, try and smile" "Let's leave nothing unsaid" "Just me and you" "And magic in the air" "A strange restlessness" "Let's leave nothing unsaid" "The only sure thing about time..." "...is that it will run out" "What if there's no tomorrow" "Let's leave nothing unsaid..." "Let's get so close" "That we're never apart again" "Never gonna let u go girl" "Never gonna let u go... No no no no" "Let nothing separate us" "Let nothing come between us" "Never gonna let u go girl" "Never gonna let u go... No no no no" "Right here right now" "Is a time for happiness" "Right here right now" "In this moment" "Try to forget, try and smile" "Let's leave nothing unsaid" "Just me and you" "And magic in the air" "A strange restlessness" "Let's leave nothing unsaid" "The only sure thing about time..." "...is that it will run out" "What if there's no tomorrow" "Let's leave nothing unsaid..." I'm from Malegaon. And you? Nevermind... you belong nowhere. You know Malegaon? It's nice... where I lived. On my route to school, There was a tree... Under which an astrologer used to sit... bang opposite... ...there was another tree, under which his grandfather used to sit. His grandfather used to shave my grandfather's beard... ...his father shaved my father's and he... ...will slit my throat! This is a blade. It has to be handled with care. If you use it the wrong way you can get hurt. Sit. I'll show you how. I didn't learn anything at school. But thanks to the barber I did learn to handle a blade, and... ...thanks to the astrologer I learned to read palms. Show me your hand... Your lifeline is very short. I don't want to be the reason for that. We were sitting and chatting like friends... Take off like that again you'll end up on your funeral pyre. It's very simple. You want to sell and I want to buy. Name your price. Come on! If you've set up shop, you might as well sell... Quote whatever price you want! It is worth 80 million. We won't take less than 50. We? Meaning... you and your partner? What's your set up with him? 50-50. - So 25 to you and 25 to him. Yeah. Why? If there's two, it's 25 each. If there's one, it's just 25. So I'll give you thirty. And my partner? If you are so tall and have such a short lifeline... How can his lifeline be long? He's short, poor guy... No boss... Please don't shoot me, boss! I'm sorry. Please don't shoot me, boss! Now he's dead for sure. Tomorrow afternoon 1 o'clock at Maratha Mandir. Bring the money along. If I hadn't seen the film Deewar... ...I would have died! This is a cool thing. This even stops a BMW So how can bullets go through? What next? Don't move! I can play this game just as well as you... This is the one thing I hate about friendships: Betrayal. I told him his lifeline was short. I came here to do business. If not with him, with you...? Give me the jewellery and take the money. The jewellery's gone... so is the money. Now it's time for you to go... There's 30 in this bag. I'll give you 35. 40... 50? This is the first bullet in the world that's worth 20 million. Take care of it. You have an hour before the end of the film... ...if by then your man doesn't show up with the 20... ...that will be the end of you. Hello, Tina! Come to Maratha Mandir with 20 million. Why? Because the film is so good that I want to... ...throw money at the screen. Hurry up! "You haven't realized who we are" "You don't know my potential" "The world is crazy after me" "Don't try to challenge me" "We can do whatever we want" "We can achieve the impossible" "You scoundrel!" "You cheat!" Why didn't you tell me? I thought you were a friend, and more... But I was wrong. You lied to me. I was fighting to get my father back... ...but I didn't know I was losing a friend I've never done anything for anyone... ...so with the time I have left, I wanted to do something good You'd said that each person needs that one precious thing ...to guide him. I made your goal my guide. And it helped me to forget My sorrow a bit. Anyway boss, a long life isn't essential. A big life is. This I why I kept it secret! Before the tumor can kill me... your melodrama will. We're the ones who conned Chandru but Omar benefited. Don't worry. I'll get the money out of him. Where will he run to? Let's go. We're disturbing the patients. It's not a patient... it's the doctor. Boss, don't do it. He'll call the cops. I didn't have a choice but to mummify him. Don't mess with me! Don't mess with me! Doctor, please. He's going the straight and narrow now... He's going straight up now. Doctor, snap out of it. You're a doctor! Open heart surgery will straighten him out. Doctor, you should listen to your patient. You are a senior citizen after all... I was a terror when I was young. Grandpa, consider your age, your maturity... You've taken an oath to save lives, not to take them! I don't remember any such oath. Oh God! The oldie has become the baddie. These are not hands they are like a noose! Uncle, do you pop some pills for extra strength? Stop it! The oldie wants to kill both of us. See you in heaven, Boss! - Stop it! I'll save him... but I won't let you go... you rascal! Remember that! Bhalerao - Calm down... calm down damn it!! One second. What did you say? You can save me? But my treatment... It's possible I had sent your reports and MRI's overseas. I got a call from Atlanta. They've had some success with cases like yours. Don't get your hopes up... The chances are slim, but they do exist. This is your only hope. Give us the slightest hope and we'll fight to make it a reality. It will cost 20 to 25 million: The travel... ...Staying there for a couple of months, post-operative care... I've approached a few charities. There is no need for that. So much money! 10 years savings. If I knew you had so much Money I would have... ...tagged on the treatment of a couple more illnesses! Sim! You are not going to believe this... Who? It's your favorite little news reporter. Now listen to the breaking News! Your con game went a bit too far. A 50 million con... I just couldn't digest it. You know, this bitch came to me for a job? She wanted 75000. I touched her... she panicked. Now for 50 million, think what I'll do to her... ...to get my money's worth. Don't you dare touch her... Look, I have very little time... And you don't have any. If you want to save the girl bring all the money... ...to the terrace of the Horizon hotel The girl was saying that you are dying... But you're as good as dead already. Roy, I don't understand. Who is this girl? I've no idea. I'm just thinking about you, Roy You are in a precarious position... I don't understand what you're doing. The line between life and death is very thin. What is that thing called? Kids play on it...? See-saw! See-saw! Put your money here, you live. Put it here, you die. You have to choose, Roy. You taught me the most important lesson of my life. I had only 30 memorable days, in 30 years... With this money I may live another 10 or 20 years... ...but not one day will be worth living. You are letting your heart decide... you've got to use your head. If this isn't intact... ...what good is this? Good luck, Roy! I love you. Do you really consider me your guru? Yes boss... absolutely! So you must make me an offering: Student to teacher. Tell me what you want. Forget Chandru, forget the money, forget me... Forget all that I've taught you. And promise me that you'll quit. I promise, boss. But why this sudden turnaround? You're going down a certain path... I am already at the end of that path. And for the first time, for the very first time it's... ...absolutely clear: Today, it's clear, I made a mistake. I want to go back... Walk a different path... but I don't have the time. You do have it. If I can get you to turn around now... ...my life will seem less futile. I was your teacher... But I only just learned the most important lesson. Money is nothing... Iove is everything. Start a new life, Dittu You are a good guy. Stay that way. Boss! Thank you. You dared to con me! Me!! I'm the master of the con game... And you're messing with me? I am the man I respect most in the entire world. Everyday, I worship myself. But because of you I have fallen in my own eyes. I have not looked at myself in the mirror for 4 days. Look, I didn't dye it: The stubble is grey. I've got your money, let her go. I don't care about the money. My image! You've ruined my image. What did you say? We can talk, or do business... ...or fire away. We did the first two... Now the third... You messed with Chandrakant Parikh! What's done is done. What do you want to do now? Say sorry. Sorry? - Yes, say sorry! Okay... sorry! Not that way. Say it from the heart! From the heart! Sorry! From the heart. Now let go of the girl. Chandru, brother, can I go? - Hey, don't call me brother. Sorry! - Don't say 'brother'. I get very emotional. It makes me think of the bond between a brother and sister. Sometimes even I have to be a pacifist. Go now! Go! Are you ok? My friend is waiting downstairs in the car. He will take you home, okay? Go... And you? What will happen to you? The inevitable! Whether it is on a hospital bed... ...or on the terrace of a building facing the sea. The end result is the same. No! I can't leave you alone like this... Sim, I've betrayed a lot of people... ...but I can't betray you to this extent. For few moments of happiness... ...I can't ruin your entire life. This is the problem with lovers in Mumbai. Give them a little space, and the romance begins. They don't care what's going on around them. We're so high up, it's windy... Are you really able to hear each other speak? Or are you content blowing into each other's ears. Hey, forget it. It's a tragic love story. Find someone else. Go on... Don't cry, Simmi. I'll con God and be back Go now. Go. So?! Who did you think you were messing with? Look Chandru... ...you only need bullets when you lack mental ammunition. It's a good line. I'll write it down. Now you listen to a good line: I can deal with you with my hands alone. Hey stuntman! Which film is it? Is there a big star? Salman? Shah Rukh? - Who's the heroine? Heroine? Film? Are you crazy? Look, the bad guys have got the girl... the good guy's jumping off a building. It's got to be a film... You trying to say this is real life? You think we're fools? "Round after round you raised the stakes" "You were in the habit of wagering" "You played the game of conning" "When will your turn come?" Who is this man? Security, evict him! "Plot after plot of false characters" "As the means so the end" "What a game of deception you have been into" "You are caught in your own trap" "Trap after trap time and again" "How will you get out of this snare?" Where is your son? - What son? Your son... who was with me the other day. He isn't my son. I'm not even married. How could he be my son? "This is the greatest illusion" "An illusion which you can hate or love" "You are consumed by this illusion" "It has snatched your world from you" You can see it for yourself. This hospital has been closed for renovations... ...for the past 3 months. Let me guess! Do you rent out this space for film shoots? Yes. Temporarily... To raise the funds for our renovation. - Of course! We can't treat you, Mr. Kapoor. We treat various ailments... But you don't have any. You only said it Roy, its the time to live... not to die. Taxi! What are you saying? You don't know it. But the plan worked out so well... Now it will all be revealed. We had a score to settle, Roy. It's done, now. I wasn't in on the plan initially. But when Arjun told me about it, I couldn't resist. Who is Arjun? - Arjun is actually Dittu... ...your devoted student... The real BluffMaster. Cheers, Roy. You're the one who said... ...one should target a big fish. It was this pill I dissolved in your drink... ...that knocked you out. Here is your tumor. You want it? I see how you pulled it off. But why? In all these lies the one truth is that I did it for my father. There he is! Well, Inspector! It looks like you were in the firing line this time. So this is your son. You interrupted my directorial debut. I was just trying to get rid of that itch... to direct. Fine way to get rid of an itch! Where's my money? It's expensive... making a film... Writing the script, location costs... ...stunts, action sequences, fake police, fake doctors... Not the doctor!? Where is he? - King Kong. Roy baby, how are you? So what are you? A hired actor... ...a dance choreographer? What? I'm a veterinary doctor. I treat all kinds of animals. I treat all kinds of animals. I'm king kong right? - Yes. The context has changed... ...but don't forget what I said at the Gateway. Never. - Very good, Roy. And those were my lines. Not the writer's. So you have a writer too. Where is he? You know him quite well... Sridhar. What are you doing up there? I don't have insurance. I am better off up here. Look, if you have a problem, talk to my agent. This is my wife, my agent... all rolled into one. I am just a writer. Get down, otherwise... First call a doctor and I'll come down, Okay! Come! Come down. He is a vet! No way... He will kill me if I come down. Sir, in my script, you were the real star... You had 3 fights, 4 songs, 2 chases, 1 item song... And 2-3 bedroom scenes...! But the director changed it all. You know how it is... No director ever listens to the writer. Chill! We're just friends, honestly. Cheers. - Good job. - Thanks. So I've met everyone... But where is the female lead of this film? It hurts to be betrayed by your own, doesn't it? Tell me, how it feels... ...to lose everything? Sim, you did it all... You made this elaborate plan with Dittu, ...you got a writer... ...and an entire cast and crew together to con me. You love me that much? I hate you. Sim, I'm the bluff master... not you! I'm sorry! Thank you... Cut it! - You moved a bit and I rock. "Oh well we tried" "He said that I am one in a million" "I want to say Hi to my player Ritesh D" "The big pops and the big chucks and my chucks Master Sippy" "My cooler the Bluff Master movie and the hip-hopfakers Vishal and Shekhar" "Here we go - Come to me. Leave the world behind"
