(MultiCom Jingle) (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) - Maybe they took another route? - [Jordan] I sure as hell hope not or we're screwed. - Uh. - No, no, it's okay. Here they come now. I'd like to get a closer look at those guys. Hey there, she is now! - Keep an eye on her, she'll give you a sign. - [Jordan] There it is, that's the white truck all right. - Okay. Operation White Horse. Unit one, over. They're doing a spectrograph of my voice. They don't trust anyone. - [Man On Radio] Go ahead, Mike. What's the good word? - They're gonna take route nine, north. We'll, uh, intercept it, quadrant 37, just about 25 miles beyond the border. They went through Turkish customs without a hitch. Checkpoint five, all clear this end. Over and out. We got to get out of here, move. (engine rumbling) (plane rumbling) (instrumental music) - [Jordan] There they are. - Get closer, take it down. (engine rumbling) Whoa, keep it steady. - What the hell is that? - [Man] Don't ask me. Not in danger. Hey, they're trying to make us stop. (engine rumbling) - Get 'em up! - [Anatolj] Hello Vera. - [Vera] Hello. - Sorry, I'm late. - Only a few minutes. - How's your daughter? - Well, the same. Thank you for asking. - Have you talked to Dr. Sloan in Boston? - Oh yes, I have. He was very kind but, you know the cost of the trip alone and then the treatment. - Can I help you? - No no no. I mean, thank you, but you already helped, telling me about the Children's Hospital. Vera. - Hm? - There's something I have to tell you. (tires screeching) (streetcar dings) - What was it Anatolj? - Huh? - What were you saying? - Oh, nothing, nothing. Doesn't matter. (keys clacking) (printer humming) - You can go in now. So long Stefan, see you tomorrow. - So long. Excuse me. - What is it? - There's a file in the computer I don't recognize. Can you come and have a look? - Just a moment. Okay. - What do you think? - Strange. We're the only two who have access to this network. Some hacker has broken in using us to reach the international system. If we don't cancel these programs fast they can do a lot of damage. (keys clacking) (computer beeps) (computer beeping) (phone ringing) (piano music) - [Man] Mr. Sjberg. - Yes? - [Man] Dr. Papoff's on the phone. - What is it? - I'm at the terminal. I was just running a program when someone else noticed and has been trying to log on. I thought I was alone. - That's your problem. (computer beeping) (instrumental music) Now you get rest. I got work for you. A bisk... And. Mm. (suspenseful music) - [Vera] Whoever it is must be a real pro. - [Stefan] That's for sure. - We better get rid of it quick. It's no use. The only thing we can do now is use our anti-hacker program to disassemble it piece by piece. Okay, you take over. - I'll get the disk. - I'll go check the mainframe. (ominous music) (guns firing) (door bangs) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (shouting) (guns firing) (groaning) - Ah! (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (gasps) (gun fires) (gasping) (whimpering) - What's happening? - Everybody run! Run! (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (gun fires) (groans) (gun fires) (grunts) (gun fires) (gun fires) (panting) (groans) (gasping) (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (gun firing) (sobbing) (retching) (engine rumbling) - I'll tell Mr. Sjberg you're here. Mr. Sjberg. Dr. Papoff. - [Anatolj] Mr. Sjberg. - This needs to be repaired. (gasps) You made a fine mess of things, doctor. - I, I did as I was told, and I was also told that no one would get hurt, there would be no violence. - I beg your pardon. You were given no such assurance. (engine rumbling) - American Embassy, may I help you? Oh I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson's in a meeting right now, could I take a message sir? - [Man] Jefferson's the new-- - [Mitzi] Yes, would you spell that for me please? - I have to get a report out tomorrow morning. - Hey, looking good, lose some weight? - [Woman] Listen, we'll try to get that fax out. All right. I'll see you later. - Nice to see you Mitzi. - Would you hold on a moment please sir? Welcome home, handsome. I'll be right with you. Sir I'm sorry, I can't help you. You'll have to call back in the morning. Thank you. (sighs) - What's all the excitement around here? Is the president coming for a visit? (phone ringing) - American Embassy. Could you hold a moment, please? Four people were killed at the Elco computer lab this morning. Matter of fact there were even more. From what we can tell at least nine, and we have no idea who did it or why. It's a nightmare. Yes sir, may I help you? I'm afraid Mr. Johnson's not in right now. - And don't forget to call. - [Mitzi] If you'd like to leave message. - Colfield, what took you so long? - [Mitzi] Well, you could call back in the morning. - Sorry Mr. Johnson. Next time I go out on a drug bust I'll take a Ferrari. - This is Alex Feldhaus, our liaison with the Bulgarian police authorities. - Haven't we already met somewhere? - I don't think so. I was playing in Istanbul before I came here. (laughs) - Huh, I guess not then. - Sorry to interrupt your chat, but I have a job for you. Let's go. (laughs) (people chattering) (instrumental music) (suspenseful music) - Elon said you wanted to meet me here. So, what is it? How much time do I have? Only two days. I'll collect the other half when the job is done. (knife clicks) - No. No. None of them are here. (sighs) - Would you mind telling us about the program again? - Like I've told you, Elco is more than an R and D center. We're also Bulgaria's biggest computer node if you like but it's very hub, we're networked into the intercontinental information system. - Go on. - The hacker that got into our network had access to databases all over the world not to mention the most important brokerage houses in New York. From what I was able to tell about the nature of the program, that's just where it was aimed. Their program is similar to a virus or a logic bomb. That means it can modify the data in an already existing program. Now do you realize what could happen. - Here's the dossier. I'll be back soon. - Okay. Vera Teodorova. Studied in Moscow and graduated with the highest honors ever granted in programming and computer science. Then she was invited to MIT where she taught for two years before returning to Bulgaria. - Very interesting, but where do I fit in? - You heard what she said about this hacker who's penetrated the database in New York. (sighs) American security has been put in jeopardy. (phone rings) - Hello. - [Alex] It's me Alex. - Oh. - The Bulgarians are questions Teodorova. She can't identify anyone but she's bright and has a good idea what the plan is all about. - I'll take care of it. - Thank you for your cooperation, Miss Teodorova. You're free to go now, but don't leave the city. Until we can shed some light on the situation, we may need to call you in for further questioning. - She's the only one who saw the killers at Elco. She barely managed to get away alive. If that's true, she may be in danger. - I'm glad you found that file. - Even if it isn't, her life is at high risk. I want to keep an eye on here, mm? Ah, Alex here will fill you in on the logistics of your mission. - Hm. So, what do you make of her story? - Well, either she was very lucky that she was out of the room when the shit hit the fan or maybe she's not telling the truth, who knows. (horns honking) (people chattering) (ominous music) - You see those guys? The one on the right is a hired gun but we could never get a conviction to stick. - I'll stay with the girl. You keep an eye on them. (suspenseful music) (horn honks) - Can I get you something? - Yes. - A drink? - A glass of water, please. - Okay. (people chattering) - Miss Teodorova. My name is Mike Colfield. I'm with the American Embassy. I think you'd better come with me. I've been assigned to protect you. Come on. (ominous music) (horns honking) (streetcar dinging) (horn honking) - I'll be ready to go in a few minutes. - [Mike] Only pack the essentials. - Okay. - You live alone in this apartment? - Yes. I used to live here with my father. He was a computer expert. - Ah. Huh. So, you took after him. - [Vera] I guess I did in many ways. - [Mike] Sounds like you miss him quite a bit. - Hm. He taught me a lot. Now I'm alone in the city. - [Mike] Ah. I'm sorry. It's not easy being alone. (soft instrumental music) - Yeah. - Are you willing to help us solve this case? - Yes, I'm willing. I want to do it for Stefan, too. - Who was Stefan? - Stefan was my student in America. He could have stayed there and had a brilliant career but when I had to return to Sofia he followed me and he was killed with the others at Elco. - How do you think you can help us? - Maybe by telling you this. After the murder there was only one thing missing, that was the disk that Stefan was using. - What was he using it for? - To disassemble the hacker's program, preventing them from gaining access to the database in New York. Stefan found their program but I don't know if he was able to destroy it. - So, what now? - If we had another copy. Stefan always made copies of our disks. - We can go to his house and have a look. (phone ringing) - [Vera] Who could it be? - Let it ring. - It's here. (suspenseful music) - [Mike] God. Jordan. Those bastards. You followed them right to the end, partner. (sighs) - Wait, there's a message! - Better hear it. (Woman speaking in foreign language) What does it mean? - Someone from the museum is looking for Stefan. - Museum? - Yes, he had a part-time job in the museum archives. I have an idea. We should go there. Who are you calling? - I haven't had time to repair the damage that was done. If I don't have the other hacker disk the person who invented it can't reverse the commands that were used to cancel our program. - I agreed to pay you well because they told me you were the best, and these are the results. So now what? - We need to find Dr. Teodorova. - Uh-huh. And what have you been doing til now? - I, uh, I was with my daughter. - Oh yeah? - [Anatolj] Yes. - She's still alive. - Yes. - I'm glad for that. (dramatic music) (soft instrumental music) (phone rings) Yes? - [Mr. Burns] Mr. Sjberg? - Oh, Mr. Burns. - [Mr. Burns] I'm calling from New York. Your purchasing order automatically goes into effect in three days. If the stock factors don't fall below the expected level within that time, the cost will be enormous. - I know. I know that, but uh, don't worry everything gonna be okay. - [Mr. Burns] Well I hope so. Goodbye. - Bye. (groans) You know what to do, don't you? No. Alive. Alive.

I can't put my finger on it. (suspenseful music) (computer beeping) - Ready? - Ready. - Give me the disk. Move. Come on. - Huh? - Ha. (doorbell rings) (dramatic music) - What are you looking for? - This. - Oh, that's not in here. That's in the Palais of Christen Church, you know it? - Where is it? - You'll find it right across the square. I worked there for 15 years. I remember that picture well. (suspenseful music) - I found it. - We have to get into that disk fast. - I have a friend who might be able to help us. - This is the church I told you contains the Frescoes that have recently been restored which depict the saints and their martyrdom believed to date from the third century. Follow me over here this way please. Let's keep together. (people chattering) Lovely artwork. Now let's move on to the next Fresco. This way please, over here. There are few examples anywhere in the world to compare to these, so study them carefully. - Sorry. We have to move. - [Woman] A chance at this one, typical of many artists. The faces too are carefully drawn with very realistic expressions. Now let's move on, follow me. Watch your step. (people chattering) (people chattering) - [Woman] Oh, look! - [Man] Ah. Okay, this one, this one. You see this thing? There you got it! - Barushka. Great to see you. - Hello Jedak. - Hi. So, you found yourself a husband. It was high time. - No Jedak, this is Mike, a friend of America. We came here because-- - A friend. What you need is a husband to keep you out of trouble. - Please, Jedak. I'm in trouble now. You have to help us. - Okay. Just follow me. (people chattering) (suspenseful music) (keys clacking) (laughing) - Of course I will be delighted to help you Mr. Sjberg in any way I can. You have always been a most generous benefactor with regard to our order, and we here in this monastery can never forget the way you left the National Swedish Bank to dedicate yourself to research. - I did my best to support the monastery. More than that. - There is, however, one thing I have never understood, why you should choose such a remote place to come to to do your research work. - As I already told you Father, especially for this project, I needed a peaceful atmosphere. (laughs) Like this. - This whole wing of the monastery has recently been restored. - Really. - Yes, and it's entirely at your disposal. - I don't know how to thank you. - (laughs) There's no need for gratitude, I assure you. (engine rumbling) (children chattering) (suspenseful music) - [Woman] Vladimir. Stay put. Don't wander off. - Come with me. (gasps) - [Vera] Mike! (grunting) (grunts) (punch thuds) - Ah! (groans) (thuds) (grunting) (phone rings) - Hello. - [Mike] Hey hi Mitzi. I have to talk to Johnson. - Mike. Where have you been? Johnson's been looking all over for you. - [Mike] Well he must be the only person in town who doesn't know where I am. Listen, put me through to him right away, will you? - He won't be back until tomorrow morning. - If it's for Johnson, I can take it. He told me I must stick real close to this case. Hello, this is Alex Feldhaus speaking. What can I do for you? - I wanted a word with Johnson. - [Alex] No luck. Mitzi already told you. He's away. - Aw, damn it. - [Alex] Anything you need to say to him you can tell me Colfield. - Ha. You can tell Johnson I want some security and a car for us tomorrow morning. I'll call back as soon as I know when and where it is to pick us up, all right? - [Alex] I'll look after it. Just one more thing. Tell me where you are now. - [Mike] In deep shit. Thanks anyway. Okay Vera, you'll be able to use the embassy computer tomorrow, all right? - Tomorrow. - [Woman] Well after working for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank for two years, he learned, uh, well he-- - So, when I got my discharge, I didn't want to go back to Kansas and marry the girl next door. An army buddy had an extra application for the CIA so I filled it out. Huh. Vera? - I can't hear you Mike. - All right, I'll turn down the TV. Hey, how about something to eat, huh? You must have worked up an appetite with all that running around. Huh. I ordered us dinner. Let me pour you some champagne. It's not the greatest. (slow instrumental music) You know, I think what attracted me to the CIA was the usual things. Adventure, romance, you know. So, like I was saying, I thought I'd become the international crime fighter. Meet a bunch of exotic foreign women (laughs) and take a look at the world. (Vera sobs) Why are you crying? Something I said? Huh? You don't have to be afraid. I'm right here, and I'm gonna stick around for awhile. - Why? - Why what? - Ever since I came back to this, to my country, I keep having the same dream. I'm alone in a place where the future is already past. I'm running after a little girl, and when I finally catch up with her I find I am that little girl. And now I'm there, in that place. (sniffs) (sobbing) - You know what to do! Mm. (sighs) (coughs) (groans) Oh. (slow instrumental music) Mm. (phone ringing) - We were expecting your call a little bit sooner. - [Man] Hello? - Yes, my alarm clock didn't go off. Okay. - One moment please. Mr. Colfield, it's for you. - I'll make it quick. - [Alex] I'll get them to bring the car around to the entrance. - Hello. Hello? Hello? Hello? (tires screeching) (exciting music) Hey, take it easy. (grunts) (sighs) (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (tires screeching) (tires screeching) (engine revving) - Go around the other way. (tires screeching) (people chattering) (laughs) - [Woman] Hey, where are you going? - (laughs) Oh, I have to go to the bathroom. (people chattering) Excuse me, I'll bring her right back. - [Man] Hey what are your-- - Take it easy, relax. It's okay. Go on, go on. I'm in a hurry, come on. Where? - Oh, wait. - What is it? - In here. (people chattering) - [Woman] That's very nice. - [Man] One of the best places I've been to. - Well honey, let's go. (suspenseful music) (moans) (gun clicks) (moaning) (sighs) (grunts) - There. We'll have to do it again. For real next time, huh? - [Woman] Then you can put a bit more into it. - Yeah. (engine rumbling) - Where are you taking me? - Hm? Don't worry about it, to a safe place, where you and Teodorova can work in peace. - And you promise she won't be hurt. - (sighs) I'm a business man. I'm not a murderer. But, maybe, maybe I was wrong about you. What do you say? Huh? Anatolj? - [Anatolj] I don't know your opinion of me. - Hm. (shaker rattling) - Can you give me some change? - Oshka! There's an American here, guess he's a friend of yours. - Hey man, how you doin'? Where you from, New York? You know now my cousin Svetla got a place in Brooklyn. - Look I just want to make a phone call. Got some change? - I got everything you need. German marks, Italian liras, coin of the realm. You name it, I got it. - Just give me a coin and keep the change. - Hey, thanks a lot dude. Next time your in town just ask for Oshka, huh? - American Embassy, may I help you? - Hello, Mitzi. I need your help. (sighs) - Please. I'm in terrible trouble. Please help me. I'm not asking for me but, but for my daughter, and for yourself. You don't know Sjberg. (door bangs) - Explained everything to her? - Certainly. I told her that she has to assemble the modules that she destroyed with her anti-hacker program. I haven't succeeded on my own but, but I'm sure that with her superior knowledge of the program and my help Miss Teodorova will be able to manage in a few hours. - Hm. - She's a world famous expert. - Mm. Definitely high esteem your colleagues hold you in. - Go to hell. - What did you say? - Go to hell. - Mm-hmm. (sighs) I want to speak with Miss Teodorova alone. - Remember. - What? - You promised. She wouldn't be hurt. - Of course not. Don't worry. (sighs) (chair squeaking) (bullets rattle) - One. (suspenseful music) Two. Three. Do you think your death will stop us? The American can't save you now. Four. Five. We have him locked up. He can live if he cooperates with us. Six. (gun clicks) Don't be a fool Teodorova, your death won't change anything. (sighs) - So then, are you going to do what we want you to? Hm? Hm, a wise choice. Very intelligent. (streetcar rumbling) (streetcar rattling) - [Mike] Mitzi! - I must be crazy coming here. - It's okay. - If anybody but you had asked me I would still be home now. - I couldn't wait to see you. - Safe and sound. (laughs) I know you can't keep your hands off me but Johnson might show up at any minute. I left a message for him. God knows if he got it. - Hey look, I'm eternally grateful to you Mitzi but what did you find out? What did you find out? - I got this. Alex has recently been making several telephone calls to this number. I tried it and found out it belongs to an investment company. It's called Sjberg Enterprises International. But last night and early this morning he made calls to this number. - To where? Well? - The monastery at Rila. - Rila, what are you talking about? - Well maybe Alex has business there. But listen to this, international security has just informed us that there was this guy name Alex Fronsky who worked for the Russians in Kartu. Sabotage, spying, all that kind of stuff. Well it seems he double-crossed the Russians, so in order to hide he had a bit of plastic surgery done to his face. - Plastic surgery. Well he wasted his money because I recognized him. That's when I was at the embassy in 1985. He worked in decoding and surveillance, was sent out on a mission and never came back. Well, now do I get to Rila? - Easy, you take the train. There's the 10:15, okay? Don't worry, I've thought of everything. I've written it down. - Okay, got it. Thanks Mitzi, I couldn't do it without you. I'll remember this. You're the greatest. - Please be careful, Mike. Watch yourself. - Don't worry. - I will. (engine rumbling) (engine revving) (gasps) (screams) (whimpering) (screaming) - No disk. Take a look at this. - Let's go. (engines revving) (suspenseful music) - Mitzi? (eerie music) (bear moaning) - [Mike] A ticket to Rila, please. - [Man] One way or round trip? - [Mike] Round trip. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (groans) (gasps) (guns firing) (thuds) (whistle blows) (train rattling) - Ah, Miss, excuse me. I'll get it for you. (knife clicks) (suspenseful music) (grunting) Who sent you? Who do you work for? (groans) Can't you tell me? (grunts) Are you alone on this train? Have a good trip. (palm smacks) - [Anatolj] The program is working fine. We'll be able to go into operation as soon as the New York Stock Exchange opens. - Good. New York is 5:00 a.m. How's she doing? - She refuses to eat. - Mm. (melancholy music) (mallet clacking) (suspenseful music) You haven't eaten for a couple of days. What's the matter? Hm? Well... I know. I have no doubt you don't find me very pleasant but, but I'm working the same as you are, under stress. (suspenseful music) (fabric rustling) Miss Teodorova, I possess the latest technological equipment, the most advanced there is, everything you need. Why don't you work for me, hm? Miss Teodorova. Please eat something won't you? (grunts) (dishes clatter) (sighs) You'll regret turning down my offer, but I'm a patient man. Think it over. (mallet clacking and echoing) Ah. Teodorova is creating problems for us. I don't think we'll ever get anywhere with her. Unfortunately, she doesn't want to cooperate. Kill her. (intense dramatic music) (mallet clanging) (grunting) (keys jangling) (groans) (suspenseful music) - Shh. (gun thuds) Sjberg sent him, to kill you. Whatever happens to me, please Vera, take care of my daughter, will you? Now get out of here. Save yourself. - You too. (sighs) (bells clanging) (keys clacking) - We're online with the New York Stock Exchange. The trading has just started. When should I activate our program? - My purchase order goes into effect at noon, New York time. I want prices to reach a record low three minutes before. (keys clacking) (suspenseful music) - The prices are falling. - Mm. Good. (gasps) - Shh. - Mike. I thought they captured you and you were in danger. - I'm sorry I'm a little late. - Mike. They forced me to, to help them. Do you have the disk? Okay, come on. - 10 more minutes. (keys clacking) (coughing) - The wonders of modern technology. (computer beeping) - What's going on? - The program. It's being canceled. - What? (high-pitched beeping) Do something, I'll be back.
