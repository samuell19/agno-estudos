But then again, 62% of all women say that size doesn't matter. Personally, I think they're full of shit. They're all men all got little dicks. [chuckles] How did Clarence measure up?

That's my prerogative. - Yes. Sorry. Yes, I finished off that guy. - Well that's interesting because I caught a newscast this morning that said a man was found shot in that very alley that we were in. Now he's currently in hospital and he can't speak. I'd like to keep it that way. - You catch the name, the hospital? - Well, he's a John Doe. The hospital's name is The Trinity on Roberts.

When the knives are red hot, I want you to bring them to me. Are you listening to me? This is really important. [Jack grunting] - [Allison] They're almost ready. - Allison, you gotta, you gotta hurry up. When they're red hot, you bring 'em to me, okay? - You're cauterizing. - Yeah. Stops the bleeding. Disinfects and makes it heal faster. Also leaves a hell of a scar. - I bet. [Jack grunting] - Hand me another knife. Is it ready yet? - Why didn't you cauterize that? - Too close to the heart. In a weakened state, the shock of cauterizing can cause serious cardiac palpitations, maybe even cardiac arrest. - That's ER talk. You must be a doctor. Or something. - Mr. Nick Turner is no stranger to any of us here. In times of difficulties, he's been a brave friend, a worthy friend. Now a whole lot of the efforts and policies that we believe necessary and integral to this great country of ours, are financed directly from Mr. Turner's ample pockets. - Cut the candy coated bullshit, okay? Turner supports your covert games- - Cigar sir? - Oh, thank you. - Because we let him smuggle drugs. Striker here may have to justify his taking money from you by financing the more questionable operations of the CIA, but I don't happen to be such a pussy. - The CIA didn't get a cut, and the DEA, they'd shut this country down faster than you could spit. And there'd be nothing coming in and nothing to line your pockets with. - Let's just cut to the bottom line, shall we? Every Senator at this table has over the years received a great deal of cash from me. Now I would like to favor returned. The "Use, Don't Lose" bill that is before the Senate now, Bill 616, I would like it passed. This bill simply states that any individual caught with an illegal amount of substance deemed for personal use only, will be issued a summary fine and will not be subject to criminal charges. - This bill means big savings to your constituents in the form of tax dollars. No more messy prosecutions. It frees up the courts and leaves the police to tend to more serious issues. - The bill is tantamount to legalizing heroin and cocaine! - Rollins, distribution will still be illegal. - [Rollins] The cities will be uninhabitable. - Oh, for Christ sakes, they're uninhabitable now. - What kind of bullshit game is going on here? - It's not a game, Rollins. If Bill 616 passes, I will become one of the most powerful, one of the wealthiest entities in the United States, which means that all of you gentlemen will be very, very handsomely rewarded. Now is that a game? - Bill 616 will never pass. - You know what your problem is, Rollins? Selective morals. Do you remember the three strikes bill that was passed in your state? I shudder to think of the amount of money I put into that. Tens of millions of dollars to make you look good. - I will not be a part of ruining this country! - [Turner] You already are. - Oh, oh what are you gonna do, Nick? Are you gonna blackmailer us into voting yes? - I advise every Senator at this table to vote yes on Bill 616. Is that clear? - Perfectly. - Let's go. [ominous music] - Fuck him. He thinks he's bigger than us? Fuck him. We'll see who's balls clang louder. - [Senator] We'll see. - I think we should make an example of him. Daemon, I've got a little job for Lisa. - Excuse me. Do you have a light? - Well, I most certainly hope so. [Lisa giggles] [fist smacking] [Rollins grunting] - Nasty habit. - [Turner] Rollins, do you have any idea how much money is at stake here? - You're out of your mind, Turner. I'm a United States Senator. You can't do this. - I can do whatever the hell I want. Now five more pushups for being so stupid! You are are a disgusting, sniveling, stinking politician. - Oh fuck you. - You have sucked on the government's tit for far too long. Do you know what we're doing here? Is that the most pushups you can do, seven? That is pathetic. Now you better do one more push up, or I'm gonna have Daemon shoot you right now. - [Daemon] Questions and answers, Senator. Who was the fifth president of the United States? - Adams. - James Monroe. And what was the name of his wife? - His wife? I don't know. - You know what annoys me? That these people that we elect to government, to Congress and the White House, they know nothing about the history of this great nation. - You son of a bitch. I'm gonna bring back slavery. [gunshots firing] - [Allison Voiceover] I don't know who this guy is. We sleep together, but he never even touches me. Sometimes I hear him call out the name Lisa. I always pick the winners. - [Marie] Pick that one, mommy. - Okay. Oh, these are gonna be so pretty, Marie. - Why was Uncle Nick so mad at you, mommy? Oh, we just had a little argument, sweetie. - 'Cause sometimes he scares me. He says bad things sometimes. - Like what does he say? - He says you ran away. You wouldn't ever run away and leave me, would you, mommy? - Oh, no baby. I would never ever leave you. I love you, Marie. Come here. - Promise. - Oh, I promise, I promise. Cross my heart and hope to die. Stick a needle in my eye. Give me a hug. Oh, I love you, baby. I love you. - I love you too, mommy. - A briefcase containing several computer discs will be within your hands in a week. It'll be delivered to your warehouse. Rick will be the courier. I assume this meets with your approval. - Is everything there? - Everything you wanted. The names of every politician, banker, cop, and Narc that ever took a payoff from us. All their bank accounts in this country and offshore there. Hell, there's enough there to blackmail half the God damn country. Believe me, those sad ass Senator sons of bitches will vote anyway you want 'em to now, I guarantee it. - Well, you'd better, considering what I paid you. - Senior Turner. [speaking in foreign language] - Senator. - General, glad you could make it. General, we got ourselves a little problema here. We're going through money faster than shit through a sick snake. The CIA is dropping weaponry in your country like it's free. Those silly sons of have no idea what this shit costs. We gotta crank up the cash flow, Nicko. - That means I'll have to move more volume. - [Striker] Yes it does. - [Turner] Which I can do if your boys don't cause me any difficulties. - Hell, I'll have the CIA guaranteed delivery to your God damn front door if that's what it takes. - I think a hands off policy will be sufficient. - Uh, does your president know about our arrangement? - The President? Shit, this is big boy stuff. That's way over his cracker ahead. - General, can you handle an increased amount? - Oh, I'm 100% sure that my operation will be able to give you what you need. - Good. - Uh, perdon, senores. Our price per kilo will have to rise by 10%. - Why? - We'll be shortening some of our customers? Good customers. - I trust you'll be open to negotiation on that. - No, not really. - You remember Lisa? - Oh yes. Absolutamente. How could I ever forget Lisa? One of my most memorable nights of my life. - We're gonna leave you two alone to have a drink and we'll discuss business later. Lisa, you'll be nice to the gentleman. - As always, Nick. - Gracias Senor Turner, Senator. - My my, that broad's pussy must be paved with gold. - I've been offered a million dollars for that broad. - You should have sold. - Well if Doreja drops his price just one point, a million dollars will be a drop in the bucket, won't it? - You think she can do it? - Well that is her job. - You ever do her? You know, just a taste for the hell of it. - Unfortunately, my pleasures are a little more complicated than that. - Long time. - Oh, much too long. - Need a drink. [Lisa giggling] You want it baby? - Yes, now. - You want it right now? - Yes. [knee smacking] [General grunting] You like that? You want more? You want more? Come on, baby, get up. Come and get it. [speaking in foreign language] - I'm gonna feed you and your mother to my dogs. - Is that what you want? Is that what you ask me for? You sleezy son of a bitch! Take it, take it! Yes! - Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - No, no! No, no, no! Where we going, Nick? Nick, where are we going? Are you fucking deaf? Where are we going?! - Do you have any idea how important Doreja is to me? Do you have any idea what you did tonight? - You ask me for, you sleezy son of a bitch! - Yes, I do. - Well, I'm sorry to hear that. - Oh, it's over Nick. - Oh, well it was, it was so good between us. - You know, I, I can't believe there was actually a time when, when I respected you. I would've done anything for you. - Lisa, you would've done anything for anybody if there was enough money involved. - You make me sick! God, I hate fucking hate you! I fucking! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - No! - From now on, you're gonna work the back room, and you're gonna be servicing couriers. - No, no, no! - Do you remember that little habit that I helped you get rid of? I think I'm gonna give that habit right back to you. - Feeling good? I hope you appreciate the quality of this stuff that I've been giving you. I didn't spare any expense. This isn't just your white boy roaming the street monkey drug shit. Oh no. This is of a quality befitting someone of your former stature. Welcome home you snot faced bitch. - Stop it! Oh God.

Get the fuck, get outta here. Come on, get outta here. Come on, move it. Move, come on, come on. - Mother fuck! [man wailing] - Up against the wall, now, move it. - [Man] Hey, hey! - Backs to me. Go on, move it, come on. Up against the wall. That's it, no, no, no, not you. Come on, get back. What's in the briefcase? - [Daemon] Don't even think about it. - This, what's on these discs, huh? - A lot of people get squashed on the information highway, fuck head, just leave it alone! - So Turner would be real pissed off if I took this then, right? - Oh, I'd say he'd be pretty pissed. - Thank you. Let's go. Don't move, don't move. [lively music] Fucking freak. Hey, we gotta keep moving. - Can I just sleep? - No no. - Yes, please. - No I just, hey. I wanna go home. - Gotta keep going. - No, no. No what? - Gotta keep moving. - What do you want? You wanna fuck me, too? - Lisa, Lisa, we have to keep moving. Please, come on. - [Cab Driver] Come on boy. Hurry up, my boy. Come on, hurry up. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Move your feet. Come on, boy. Come on, come on, come on. - What are you doing? - Where's my money? - Where's your money? - They coming to kill you, man.

Come on, come on. Where's my shit going down money, man? ♪ And the universe Don't, gimme all your money, man. All right. - There you go. Okay, open the door. - No, man. - What are you doing?

There you go, there's all my money. - All right. - All my money. - This better be all the money, man. - That's it, that's all I got. - A cab. - Back of the alley. - Where's the limo? - Okay, go. - Better not fool no time here. - Get in there. Drive this motherfucker. - You sure you not- - Drive it, drive it! [gunshots firing] - I got the plate. - Nobody, nobody tells Turner! - He's got the discs! He's got Lisa. - [Cab Driver] Woo! Oh my God! Shoot up me cab, man. - Take me to the Hanover Hotel. Step on it. - [Cab Driver] All right. Me know where it is, man been look it up. Oh boy. - Where are we going? - Hey what you got in that brief case there, Star? - That's none of your concern. - What you got in the briefcase? - You know, I didn't want to have to do this, but that was wrong. Very wrong what you did back there, taking advantage of people. I've become very sensitive about being taken advantage of. Now please hand me back all of my money. - Hey man, it, it was just a fucking joke, huh? I was fucking with ya. It almost worked, huh? What a gas. [laughs] I guess you want your money back, huh? - [Jack] Yes, I do. - All right, Star. - All of it. - No problem. It, it's all here. - Now I had $1,000 in my pocket when you picked me up. - [Cab Driver] Uh-huh. - Here's your $200 I promised you. That was the deal, right? - Oh yeah, man. It's cool, man. A double C note is more than not enough for me. I can survive on this, you know? You can't blame my mind for trying, you know? - No, you can't, but you can blame a person for being greedy, dishonest and sleazy. - Me not dishonest. Just trying to get mine. - [Man] This guy came outta nowhere like set up. - [Turner] You know what was in that briefcase? Computer discs. Do you know what was on the discs? - Get out of here. - Data. The names of every politician, Narc, banker, cop, that I have ever made payoffs to. Every fucking one of them! How much we paid them. The numbers of the secret bank accounts. Aren't you an idiot? Now what you're telling me, Daem, is that the same man that stole this briefcase is the man that you couldn't kill in an alley or a hospital bed! - Yes. - Jesus. - Last time. - Put down. Now Daemon, I would like to know why my discs were not put in a vault. - Well the guy that brought him was, he was still with Lisa when the, you know the. - They should have been put in a vault right away. Who was in charge of vaulting the discs, Daemon? - Wasn't me. - Yeah, it wasn't me. - Benny, it was the kid. - [Turner] Benny? Come here, Benny. Now you're telling me that you put a 14 year old child in charge of vaulting my discs? - Program training. - God damn it, Daemon. He's a good kid. You put him in way over his head. Shoot him. [gunshot firing] - I gotta get my daught- - No, you have to stay here. - My baby. - You have to stay here. - Marie. She's my daughter. I have to get her. - Where is she? - She's with Turner, so I gotta- - Well, where does Turner live? I'll get her for you. - No, I gotta- - No, no, no, no. - No, I gotta get her. - You stay here. - I'll get her. - I gotta get, no- - Tell me where she is. Lisa, Lisa. - She's my baby. - Lisa, stay here. - No you don't understand. - Lisa just, where's Marie, where is she? - She's my baby. - I'll get Marie. I'll get Marie. I'll get her. - Promise? - Yes, I promise. - Promise? I promise. I promise. - Okay. - Hey, how can I help you, son? - I need a police car. - Son, you can get in a lot of trouble talking to an officer that, you're joking, right? - It's no joke, officer. I'm sorry. - Jesus. - What size shirt do you wear? - You're in big trouble, son. [tense music] - You Mr. Turner? - I'm Mr. Turner. Is there a problem, officer? - Oh, no problem at all, sir. I have a package in the car for you. - Since when did the police make deliveries? - Look, it's a surprise from an admirer of yours. You got a daughter? - I'm guardian to a little girl. - Hm, she at home right now? It's uh, it's perishable. I got it in a cold box. It's a really nice ice cream cake. - Ah, okay. You get that package. [tense music] - You're really gonna like this. - Well that's great. - I knew it was you. I knew it was you. Who the hell are you?! - Where's Marie, where's the girl, huh? - Do you have any idea who I am? - Tell me or I'll blow your head off. - Let him go, asshole. - You're a dead man. - I've been dead once already, I can handle it. What about you, huh? What about you? - Kiss your ass goodbye, dead man. - You know anything about hydrostatic shock? Motor reflex response, huh? He shoots me and every muscle in my body will snap tight. My gun will go off. We'll die in each other's arms together. Romantic, isn't it. - Medical lecture. Let me help you demonstrate. - Tell your boys to back off, now. - Daem! - Come on, tell 'em. - I said back off, Daemon. Ah! - I'll kill him. I'll kill him. Go get her. For Christ sakes, go get her. - I promised to grease this asshole, Mr. Turner, and I hate to break a promise. - Daemon, Daemon. - You, drop the gun. Drop the gun. - [Turner] Drop the gun. - Put her in the car. Okay muscle head, let's go. Okay, let's go. Come on. Come on, move it, move it. Let's go, move it. Straight back. Right back or he dies. [Turner grunting] Shut up. - I don't know who you are, but you're finished. I don't care where you go. I'll find you and I'll kill you myself. - I'll be waiting. - Oh, I wouldn't. - Don't. Might hit Marie. - You okay, honey? - [Marie] Yeah. - I'm Jack, I'm a friend of your mommy's. Better put your seatbelt on. - I already have it on, Jack. - I assume same interloper now has the discs. Am I right? - Well, he has the briefcase, so yes he has the discs. [Striker clicking his tongue] - Oh, this is gonna make some people very unhappy. If those discs get into the wrong hands and our funding program's exposed, mm mm mm. We just can't have a situation like that. I just have to put an end to it. Call in my boys and snuff out everybody. Stopping with you. You better find those discs real quick. - Are you threatening me? - It's not a threat, Turner. That's a promise. You're dispensable. Oh, we need the cash flow you provide, but you, well you can be replaced. And if I find those discs before you do, you will be replaced. - Yeah man. Get me car once more. I'm a come get your boys! Me come through your alley, man. Stop, leave my car alone. My mash up, man! [men yelling] Damn boys, get your hand off, get your, get your- - Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. Leave the man alone. Go home, go home! - [Man] Hey, come on, punch you in the face. - Run outta here. Thanks a lot, brudda. Hey, I appreciate it, huh? Man, ya dress pretty nice for a neighborhood like this. Get in me car. I'm a give you on your boys a ride, all right? - [Daemon] No man, I don't want a ride. I want you. - Motherfucker. - A guy, a girl, a briefcase. Think fast, talk faster. [speaking in foreign language] - Me know me should have taken that briefcase when me had a chance, man. - [Daemon] What's your name? - Trevor, motherfucker. - Well if you had, Trevor Motherfucker, you'd be dead right now. Where are they? [Trevor laughs] - Me know me got something that you want, Star. So before me give you anything, you gonna have to make a deal, all right? - How about I just put a bullet in your head? - But that ain't gonna get you too much, is it? You stupid piece of fucking white pork. [laughs] Yeah man. - You're right. How much? - This information gonna cost ya $500. At second thought, man, this important information. Me can't give it up just like that. Make it a grand. $1,000, me give you where he taken tomorrow. Yeah man, me take 'em to the Hanover. - You happy now? - Well, me happy for now, you know? Me take him to the Hanover, boy. H-A-N-O-V-E-R, the Hanover. Me see you later, all right? - You're a greedy cock sucker, you know that? And uh, this is what happens to greedy cock suckers. - Hey, hey, what going on here, man? What, what you doing? Take it easy, man, hey. No, no, me no want no money at all. No money, no money at all, man. - Take this, take this. - You're right. What's going on here, man? - Need more money, huh? - Me not, me not, me no want no more money- - I'll give you money. Yeah, take all this. - Me no want no money. - Take it all. Take all the money. - Honest man, me just trying to make a little- - Listen to me. There are seven different kinds of inks used in the printing of money. Each one has a fire retardant. But you know what? Money still burns. [Trevor whimpering] - No, what? That's not lighter fluid. No, no, no, no, not lighter fluid, man! [Trevor screaming] No man! What you gonna do that lighter fluid, brudda? Don't let this happen to me. Not my final hour. Ah, no, no, no! [flames roaring] [Trevor screaming] - [Daemon] We're from the Department of Social Services and we're looking for a man. Tall, brown hair, slight tan, who brought a little girl into our hotel recently. We suspect he may be abusing her. - You know, Jack, you really shouldn't have taken the briefcase. Here baby. You're such a big girl. What's that? - Tagamet, I've got ulcers. Can't imagine why. - Jack, why are you doing this? You know, I mean, why you helping us? - Come on, we better go. It's not safe here anymore. [gun cocking] [tense music] - [Daemon] Check the kitchen, bathroom. Where are they? Talk, now. - They just left. - Daemon, think we just found out who our friend is. He's a doctor, Jack Davies. Jr. Look at this, guy prescribed the pills for Jack, Jack Davies Sr. - That's really bright, buddy. Why don't you just hand our newfound friend here addresses and telephone numbers. - [Man] What the hell is she gonna do? - [Daemon] "What the hell is she gonna do?" Well now she's seen our faces and you've not only given her one name, but two! Sorry. Let's play a little game. Questions and answers. Where was Abraham Lincoln born? - Springfield, Illinois. - Impressive. Next question. Who was the youngest man ever to be president. - Theodore Roosevelt, 42 years old. - Oh, very good. Very good. Okay, now the last question. This one's a little tough. Who was the shortest man ever to become president. - James Madison, 5'4. - Oh, fucking fantastic. No one ever get to that one. - I just, I just took my citizenship test. I got all the answers right. I, I've been study for four months and I know all the answer. You go ahead and ask me more. I know the answer. Go ahead. - You really impress me, you know that? - You gonna let me go now? - You did great. And I really, really like you. But see, that's one of the bad things about my job. Sometimes I have to kill people that I like. But hey, every job's got its drawbacks, right? [gunshot firing] - Let's go. - You live here? - Took it for a few weeks. - Safe house? - Hopefully. The way information can be accessed these days, who knows what's safe and for how long. There's over 100 names here, including seven senators. and the Chief of Police in New York City. What the hell is this? - I really think you should send the discs back to Turner, Jack. - [Jack] Someone's moving around hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore accounts. Take a look at this. Central Europe Bank, Channel Islands Branch, account number 336791. 112 million, US. - Turner's gonna kill you, Jack. That is, if someone else doesn't get to you first. What, what are you, some kind of cop or something? - No, I'm just someone who got caught in the middle of this who happens to give a shit? What's this about, huh? What's Turner into? Lisa, tell me what's going on here. - Look, Turner's in business with the government of the United States of America, okay? They, they allow him to import and distribute heroin and cocaine. I mean, do you have any idea the money we're talking here, Jack? And a lot of it goes to payoffs. I've been with Turner for 13 years. I know his business inside and out. - That's why he wouldn't let you leave. - Send the disc back, Jack. - No. - God damn it, send them back! - No. Don't you see? There's a reason for why I have these discs. I'm a doctor. I worked in emergency. I've seen the damage drugs can do. I have a chance here to do something that makes a difference. - You are gonna get us killed. - I'm putting you and Marie on a bus tomorrow. I think it's best if you both just disappeared. [doorbell ringing] - Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I have a couple of questions I'd like you to answer. - [Mrs. Davies] Oh my God. Jack, no, Jack! Oh God, no! Jack! Oh God, Jack! Jack! [crying] - Do you have a son? - Yes. Is he in trouble? - Yeah. Very big trouble. Is your son named Dr. Jack Davies Jr? - [Mr. Davies] Yes. - Beautiful. We're doing great. - Don't hurt her. - Now for the big one. I need a telephone number, an address. - Oh God. - He took something of ours, two things. We want 'em both back. How do I get in touch with Jack Jr, Jack? - Jack stole something from you? - Yeah. [laughs] Terrible, isn't it? Telephone number, please. - [Marie] Jack! - Hey. Oh, you're getting cuter every time I see you. - Are you coming with us? - Have you finished packing? - No. - Why don't you go finish packing? - Okay. - All right? - Oh, good girl, Marie. - You look great. - Um Jack, I don't think you know exactly what it is you're doing. - If I don't know where you are, neither will Turner. - No, that's um, that's not what I mean. Marie is Turner's daughter. - I know. - Well, he's not gonna let her go. - All the more reason for you to disappear. Here's $15,000. My parents' number, just in case you get into trouble. They know where to reach me. [serene music] - [Lisa] Marie. I can't do this. Mommy's gotta go help, Jack, okay? We're gonna get off the bus and mommy's gonna take you to a friend's house for a couple days. It's gonna be okay. [serene music] [phone ringing] - [Jack] Hello? - [Turner] Glad I caught you at home, Jack. - Who is this? - I didn't catch you at a bad time, did I? - Who is this? - Well, a bright boy like you should have guessed that by now. This is Nick Turner, and you have a couple of things that belong to me and I would very much like them returned. - Fuck you. - Yes, indeed. I thought that might be your attitude. However, I'm standing in someone's kitchen right now, and I believe that you know this someone very well. Perhaps you'd like to say a little hello, Jack. Talk. - Jack, is that you, son? - Dad? Oh Jesus. I'm so sorry. - Son. - Dad! - [Turner] Dad? I guess that's proof enough. Jack, we're about ready to cut your good father's finger off. He wasn't a surgeon, was he? - You bastard. - Cut away, Daemon. - [Jack] Turner, don't. [Jack Sr screaming] No! No. [Jack Sr grunting] [Mrs. Davies crying] - It was your fault, Jack. And I sincerely hope that you are Catholic and that guilt makes you suffer. Now, you have my briefcase and you have Lisa and Marie, and I would like them returned immediately. You do have the case, don't you, Jack? - Yes. - [Turner] And you have Lisa and Marie? Jack, you have Lisa and Marie, don't you not? - Yes. - Good, then I would like to meet you in one hour sharp. And if you do not make it or you show up without my briefcase or without Lisa and Marie, you will be at orphan. - Where are we meeting? [intense music] - Damn. [taser zapping] - Now I'm gonna ask you some questions, and you're gonna tell me what I want to know. Do you understand? Good. Now that I have your attention, you can tell me where those discs are. - My dog ate 'em. - [chuckling] We're not talking about homework here, Jack. You will tell me what I want to know, otherwise I will be forced to kill you. What's required here, I believe, is a, certain degree of subtlety. I'm not a monster, Mr. Davies. Nothing I do here gives me any real pleasure. So I'm gonna afford us both the opportunity to avoid this situation by asking you one more time. Where are the discs that you appropriated from Mr. Nicholas Turner? - I told you, my dog ate 'em. - Hm, I used to use sodium pentothal for this sort of thing, but it slows things down. Deaden's the subject's responses. Now I go straight for the pain. You know what this is? - It's a Simpson number seven surgical scalpel. It's used for making preliminary incisions. - Correct. Now I'm going to take this very delicate surgical instrument and shove it underneath your fingernail. I assure you, the pain will be excruciating. [Jack grunting] The disc, the other copies, where are they, who has them? - I don't know, I don't know! Fuck, I don't know, you bastard! - I think you best not move, Mr. Davies. Might cause me to slip and do more serious damage. Or one of these fine servants of our government may accidentally put a bullet in your head. [Jack grunting] Where are the discs? Did you make copies? Where are they, who has them? Where are the fucking discs? - I don't know. I don't fucking know, God damn you! - Oh yes you do, Jacko. You will confess. Play the tape. - [Lisa] Jack, send the disc back. Please, Jack, please send them back. - Dr. Jack Davies, Jr. I've been doing some research on you. You're a pretty interesting fellow. Your daddy was a doctor, granddaddy, too. You entered Harvard Medical School at the early age of 18. Graduated with honors. You spent your internship at one of the bloodiest emergency rooms in the country, but when your residency came up, you chose to stay. That says a lot, Jack. You will tell me what I want to know. Because if you don't, I will bring that sweet girl in here, strap her into a chair not unlike the one you are in now, douse her in ice water, and attach battery cables to various very tender sections of her exquisite anatomy, and I will turn the power on full. Before I do that, I will take that scalpel and slice off your eyelids, so you will have to watch every moment of it. Are we clear? - Wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay, okay. I'll tell you. [coughs] I'll tell you. [coughs] - What, Jack? What is it? Where are the discs, Jack? [Jack coughing] Where are the discs, Jack? [Striker screams] No! Don't shoot, don't shoot, we need him! Don't, don't shoot, we need him! [Striker screaming] [gunshots firing] [Jack panting] - I need your cab. Sorry to have to do this. I need your cab, get outta the car. - [Cab Driver] Fuck you. - Fuck me? I'm the guy holding the gun. Get outta the fucking cab. All right? Sorry to have to do this, man. [intense music] - [Jack Voiceover] Where are we meeting? - [Turner] Well, Jack, I have a lovely place for that. It's in the country. Ironically, it belongs to my parents. It is secure, secluded, and I want you to listen very, very carefully to the directions, because you have one hour to get there, and I would hate for you to waste time getting lost. Must have been quite a cab ride, Jack. You're looking a little worse for wear. - I'll tell you about it some time. - Jack. - You okay? - Yes, beautiful moment. Now open the case, please. Do you have the discs? - Yeah, they're in the briefcase. - Well good, open it. - Why don't you tell your boys to back off? I don't- - Why don't you open the case, Jack? Thank you. Very good, now where are Lisa and Marie? - After my parents are safely released, I'll tell you where Lisa and Marie are. - Well Jack, you know if there are any tricks, I will kill you and I will kill both of your parents. - No tricks, no tricks. - James, escort Dr. Jack Davies Sr and his lovely wife to Jack Jr's cab. Say goodbye to your parents. - Easy. - Oh Jack. I didn't know. No, please, no. - Take care. - All right, all right. Don't do anything stupid. - Anything happens to my parents you'll never see Marie and Lisa again. [tense music] Jack, your parents have left. Where are Lisa and Marie? Jack, start talking. - 20 Minutes. - Sorry? - After my parents have been driving for 20 minutes, I'll tell you where Lisa and Marie are. - Jack, there's no fucking 20 minutes. - That's the deal. - There's no fucking 20 minutes! There's no fucking 20 minutes, ain't a fucking deal! Shoot him. - You shoot me, and you'll never find Lisa and Marie. Your 20 minutes have officially lapsed, Jack. Where are Lisa and Marie? [Jack laughs] Is there something fucking funny? - I have no idea where they are. - Yes, that is funny. Jack, that knife is poised over the same finger that we severed from your father's hand today, and I think that's appropriate. Where are Lisa and Marie? I'm sorry, Nick. I have no idea where they are. - You're a liar. - I'm not brave enough to lie. [Jack screaming] - You're a liar and I detest liars. Either answer the question, or maybe you'd like me to sever another finger? Jack? Jack? - Not, not especially, but, I don't think I have a choice. I don't know where they are. - This isn't working. It's just not working, man. Luckily I have a surprise. The cab that I put your mother and father in is loaded with enough explosives to blow them into next week. This, Jack, is a remote detonator. When this little red button is pushed, you will become an orphan for the rest of your very short life. And Jack, it's gonna be your finger that pushes this button. - Like hell it will, like hell. - [Turner] Just like hell. [tense music] - Turner! Get out here, Turner! Get your God damned crippled yankee ass out here. You hear me? Turner, get your crippled ass out here now! - Striker, I got the disc. So you shut your mouth and you and your boys get the fuck outta here! - Oh, now Nick, that's a most ungracious welcome. Now I told you if I got the disc before you, I'd be taking over. - Daemon. - Well well, if it isn't my dear friend, Dr. Jack Davies, Jr. - As you can see, Striker, I've got the discs. - Well, maybe for a minute or two. - I was wondering how you found me. - [Lisa] Jack. - You picked the wrong horse, Lisa. - Nick, Nick, you just got too greedy. You're a liability now. Well this enterprise generates too much money, far too much money for you to fuck it up. Give me the briefcase, Nicko. - Or what? You and your little boys here gonna shoot me? I suggest you get the fuck outta here and maybe I'll let you fuckin' live. - Oh no, Nick. Now I think you best get that briefcase to me with those discs in it or I will be forced to shoot this lovely young thing. I'm gonna give you a three count. One. - Two. Go ahead, fucking shoot her. Dead is good for me. - [Lisa] Nick, no! - Three! [gunshots firing] - Hey Daemon. [gunshot firing] - Ooh! Oh, ooh. Who the hell are you? - That's a good question. [gunshot firing] I want the briefcase, Turner. - Jack, there is nothing of value in this briefcase for you, but there is for me. There's $10 Million in the back of my limo. The keys are in the ignition. So why don't you just get in it and fuck off. - No deal. - I'll throw in Lisa and Marie. Did Lisa tell you that Marie is my daughter? - Yes she did. - I have just offered you an instant fucking family, $10 million in cash, which will generate $20,000 a week for the rest of your miserable fucking life. What the hell do you want? Let me get on with my God damn business. - No! - Well, what are you gonna do, Jack? Are you gonna stop the entire drug trade by yourself? It's bigger than you, pal. It's bigger than me. It's bigger than the God damn government. Do you know how much money is involved? Why do you think they don't stop it, Jack? You know, you're a dumb shit. [gunshot firing] - I will meet you at Turner's estate, come alone. And Striker, if I'm not at a certain rendezvous within one hour after our meeting, the disc will be delivered to the media. Is that clear? I have information on you and your associates that could ruin your lives. Put you behind bars. My demands are relatively simple. If within 90 days from now, the public media does not commence running stories on the drying up of the drug flow, with appropriate support figures, of course, I will go public with the information I have. - Drug business is a huge business. There are people out there eager to step into Turner's shoes. Billions are at stake. We can't dry up the drug flow just like that. - Yes you can. You just don't want to. Let's be honest about this. - New players will come in. Players outside the realm of our influence and control. - Yes, that will probably happen. New players will come in, but what I want is one year. One year of no big business drug flow. And if I don't get it, you're gonna be some sorry ass motherfuckers. So you better try damn hard. And after that year, I think I might want another year, and another year after that. Got the picture? - I got the picture. - I'll call you in one year. - [News Reporter] During the last few months, both the DEA and the CIA are claiming that this is the result of their intensified efforts to win the drug war. Meanwhile, the Senate block supporting Bill 616, referred to as the controversial "Use, Don't lose," bill, has withdrawn its support. Senator Striker, chairman of the group, had this to say. - [Striker] In uh, reexamining our position, we feel that Bill 6- - You won, Jack. - About time, Lisa.
