Mimulus bigelovii. Hey, just checking in on you. Your email mentioned a new project. Just... Just want to know where you're at. I... I found something really sweet yesterday in her room. It was this book of pressed flowers you'd given her. "Little flowers for a little sister," you wrote on it. Anyway, we... we just want you to know that we love you and we miss you. I'd love to talk when you get a chance. Okay, we'll talk to you soon, Elly. Hmm. Are you okay? I saw your foot tracks. I didn't know if you broke down or something. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for checking. There are better places to hike out here than this. I'm actually working. I'm doing a plant survey. Oh, my dad was talking about that. Something about a plant that's been spreading. Yeah, pretty much. Um, okay, well, thanks again for checking. Do you need any help with your work? No, no. I'm okay. I'm not supposed to be out here. Kind of skipping school. Yeah, I've done my fair share of that too. Oh, you actually could help me out, though. I... I'm here at Eagle Head Canyon, right? Yeah, it's about a half a mile that way, uh, where the big dip is. Awesome. Thanks. Well, I mean, you're... you're already out here. You can... You can help me if you want. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Cool. Just go down here. So that... that's it. Mm-hmm. Pretty ugly. Yeah, that... For sure. - You see the different colors? - Yeah. - See? - Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. - Pretty cool, right? - Pretty cool. Yep. You take really good pictures. And we'll get this to the county. Yeah, I know you're doing an amazing job with all of this. That white shoot over there. All right. Yeah. Yeah, that's... 8-5-5-6. Mm-hmm. Yep. What kind of flower is that? Oh, um... it's a buttercup. My mom had tattoos. All right, well, we should get you back before you get into trouble. But we can... we can come out here sometime, on a weekend, if you want. - Cool. - Cool. All right, well, I'll be a couple of hours behind you. I still have some work to do. Okay. I'll see you later. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Come on. Come on! Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Hey! Are you okay? No, no! No! No! Okay! Okay, okay, okay. No, no! Please, no! No, no! Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. What do you need? What do you need? Wait. Wait. Okay. Do you know where you are? Do you know what direction you're facing? Do you understand me? We are hours from the nearest road. And the sun is down. We're in the middle of the desert. You need... Okay! Um... Do you have a GPS? A GPS? Anything you had is burned up over there, okay? I know where we are. I know this desert. I can take you wherever you need to go. Okay? Just tell... tell me wherever you need to go. Salton Sea. The Salton Sea. Okay, um... That's a... that's a big area. Do you know what part? Here. Hold on. North, south, east, west. Where? Southwest? Okay, I can take you there! Okay. - Get the drugs. - Okay. Get the drugs! Move! Get it. Get it! Okay. Okay, that's all of it. - More. - No. No, that's all there was. There... I mean, there might have been more, but it's all burnt up. Move, move. Salton Sea. That way. That way. What happens once we get to the Salton Sea? Look, I have... Uh, I have two bags in my trunk and I think that they will fit all of the drugs. Uh, and I will leave you with the drugs once we get to the Salton Sea, and you can walk the... the rest of the way with them, and I will leave. I won't see anyone. I won't talk to anyone. I won't say anything. And you'll be gone by the time I'm back to town. No, I need to know or I'm not gonna take you there! - Wait, watch out! - Whoa! Stop! Don't move. We go. Move. Get out. Wait. Wait. You wanna walk to the Salton Sea? That... That's like 50 miles. Okay, that'll take a couple of days. Let's... Look, let's just try to fix the car. Will you let me try? The truck is stuck. The wheels are destroyed. I-I don't have enough water. And you have two bags. Just like you say, we'll carry on the drugs. Load them. Come on. Come on. We can't... We can't do this. We're not gonna make it. Okay, Salton Sea. Hi, Jim. Hi there, Jose. How are you? - Oh, you know, living the dream. - Hmm. How's Imperial County treating you? Well, uh, some dirt bikers just found a buried body out here on the border of Imperial and San Diego County. - Oh, man. - Yeah. I think the coyotes got to it and dug it up. Otherwise, it was pretty well-buried, but it's a mess. The body was all beaten and bloodied. Male, Latino, 40s. What? You say it's in my county or yours? Well, that's why I'm calling you. The gravesite has technically crossed the line of both counties. I had to check the GPS. It's in the middle of the desert. I don't know how you wanna handle this. Now, listen, I appreciate you reaching out, Jim. I'm personally really short-staffed right now. It's just me out here this week. Ed's on vacation. Mary's down to three days a week in the office. Yep. - I could get the coroners out there... - Mm-hmm. ...but it'd still be a half day's drive out of San Diego. Yeah, I know. I get it. I get it. We got a team in El Centro that can come out. I just wanna make sure you guys have the chance if you wanted it, you know. No, I appreciate it, Jim. You bet, buddy. You've been seeing, uh, much drug stuff lately in your area? Not for a long while. It's brutal like that shit from a few years back, though. Well, I'll email you our report in a few hours so you have it. You say safe out there, Jose. All right. Yeah, thanks. Thanks, I appreciate that, Jim. My pleasure. I need a break. - No. - Please. Please, just a few minutes. I need some water. Okay. Hey! Hey! Hey! No. No! No, no, no. No! Oh, Jesus. What the hell, Alex? What are you doing without a helmet, Alex? What did I tell you about that? I couldn't find it. It was on the patio. I saw it this morning. If you can't find it, you ask me for a ride or someone else. Now get off, I'll put it in the back, We'll take you to school. I'm two minutes from school. I don't want you riding 5 feet without a helmet. Now, come on. Let's go. I'll just push it there. Alex. Drop by the house on my lunch and bring it to your classroom. What do you got? Ms. Marlin, fourth period? Just leave it in the front office. Hey. Jose, it's Mary. Jose, you there? Yeah, Mary. What is it? Where's your pretty face at? I'm out here handing out speeding tickets. I'll be back in the office soon. What's up? Carl from the county is here, askin' if you've seen our new botanist, Elly? Not today, no. I guess she and Carl were supposed to meet this mornin'. He can't get a hold of her. Drove in from San Diego for it. I'm sure she just forgot. Probably still out in the field. I told him. He's pissed, though. If you see her, have her give Carl a ring, will you? He's in a mood. I know that mood. Thanks, Mary. Dad, I was in the desert with Elly yesterday. What do you mean? I skipped school to ride and I ran into her. Jesus, Alex. I learned a lot. It was really cool. - Well, did you come back with her? - No. She said she was gonna stay out there a few more hours and then drive back. Where was she exactly? At the bottom of the Eagle Head Canyon or something. In the plains, right around there. What if her car broke down? Maybe she needs help. I'm sure she's probably fine. Did he check her motel? I'm going to go check. No, you're gonna go to school. No, I'm going to find Elly. God damn it, Alex. Real quick, and you're going directly to school. Open the gate. I haven't seen her, uh, since we checked in. See her car come back last night? No. I was workin'. Not sittin' there starin' out the window. We close up the office at about 8:00. Oh, you haven't cleaned her room today, yeah? What time is it? 10:16. No. No, maids don't arrive until after 11:00 durin' the weekdays. Is there anything else I can do for you? No, we're good. Thank you. Okay, that's good. Dr. Phil's waiting for me. - All right, we'll lock up. Thank you. - Okay. All her stuff's still here. I don't think she came back at all yesterday, Dad. She didn't sleep in that bed either. And she doesn't know the area at all. All right, I'm gonna drive out there. I'll come with you. Nice try. You're goin' to class. Look, if she turns up, have Mary try to reach me on the radio. - Dad. - Alex. Don't worry, okay? I'm sure she's fine. See you tonight for dinner. Okay. We need to get out of the sun. We need shade. We're both burning up. We need to head to those canyons. That's not the way. We're not gonna make it to the Salton Sea. It's straight desert with no shade. Okay, we need to get back to Borrego Springs. No. If we keep walking this way, we are gonna die. Okay, that's the only way. We get back to Borrego Springs, I will find you a car, you can call whoever you need to call. And we can go into town at night. No one's gonna see you. I don't know. It... it will take a day, but it will be shaded canyon most of the way and we can do the rest at night. No. We stay here. No, we'll die here! He'll come. Who? Do you see anyone here? We are alone. No one is ever gonna find us here, all right? We're in the middle of the fucking desert! You really need to wrap your leg. Put compression on it. Tie it up with your jacket. You have to tie it tight. We're goin' to the canyon. Everything all right? - Speak English? - Oh yes, yes. What the hell is that? Uh, an abandoned truck. Just found it. - No one in there, right? - No, no. I think it's been there for a while. You've seen anyone out there? No, there's never anyone out here. We had a bet to see how far from camp we could get before one of us pussed out from the heat. It's hot. Saw your truck drivin' in the distance. I thought maybe you were border patrol or somethin'. But you're the opposite of that. Anything good left in there? Nah. We should probably call this in, huh? No! No, no, no! Thank you. How did your plane crash? Engine stopped. No good plane. Small plane. No radar on the border. - What is this stuff? - Hmm? This stuff, what is it? Mmm. I need to pee. - Go. - I can't do this by myself. Go! Move. Thanks. We go. Mary, you there? I need help! Does anyone read me? I have an emergency. Does anyone read this? This is Deputy Sheriff Jose Gomez. I got a homicide scene with two bodies and a third missing person. Do you copy? Hello? Goddamn it! Does anybody read me? I need help. I have an emergency! Anyone? Hello, does anybody read me? This is San Diego County Deputy Sheriff Jose Gomez in need of immediate assistance. Fuck me. Pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up. - Hi, you've reached Jose Gomez... - Where is he? Oh my God, it's growing out here. The path ends. Where we go? Up that, I think. We're at the end of the slot. We need rest. We can climb this in the morning. Still light. We can continue. How far Borrego Springs? I don't know. Uh... We have to climb to the top, and then walk through the canyon on the other side, and it's still a long way back to town. A really long time. We climb, then rest. Sleep, finish in morning. Yeah, we can try. We go. You need to untie me. If I fall and I die, who's gonna carry your drugs for you? Dad, are you there? Dad, it's Alex. Come on. Is someone there? I'm looking for Deputy Sheriff Gomez. Please help. - Whoa! - No! No! Tomas. I'm Elly. Why you were out... on the desert? I'm a botanist. A plant scientist. I'm doing a survey on that plant we saw earlier in the canyon. Something that isn't supposed to be here. Like us. I was a teacher. Who knows how to fly? My father... he was a pilot. As kid, we fly a lot. He taught me. I don't like fly. Okay, so why do you do it? I lost my job. No work. My cousin got me a job in a fishing boat. Moving gasoline. I didn't know that the gasoline was for the cartel. My father is sick. And the... medicine is... expensive. Sometimes, when the monster comes... you have to say "yes." Yours. What is buttercup? It's my favorite wild flower. Um... That's it. It was my nickname that my sister gave me when she was little. She gave me that a few years ago. She was younger than me. She was my half-sister. And she wanted to be just like me. She... wanted to grow up really fast. She... She's not here? No. She was so funny and so smart. And I wasn't. I was... ...awkward and anxious, and I never felt comfortable. So I started taking stuff... for depression and anxiety. Stuff to go to sleep, stuff to stay awake, stuff just to... just to help me forget. Then one morning, she asked me to drive her to school, and I... I had been up for like three days. But I couldn't tell her "no." Then I ran a red light. And I watched her die. And after that I just... I couldn't be in that town, and drive down that road, and see her room. So I ran. I ran from everything and everyone. And I have to keep running. We can keep running. Father of my father told him, and he told me... "Never run like a lamb." "Run like a wolf." We sleep. Come on. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Alex? Alex? Dad! Alex! Dad, where are you? - Dad! - Alex, be careful! I can't see you. It's not safe. You gotta go now, honey. Are you okay? Alex, get out of here! - Tell me you're okay. - I'm fine, honey. Okay? I... I'm a little banged up, but you gotta go now. What's going on? I don't know. Bad things. I found Elly's car and two dead bodies. I chased a man up here who shot at me. Listen to me. I need you to take my truck and drive as fast as you can till you get reception, and then let 'em know what's goin' on. Your radio's destroyed. Your truck's out in the desert. Okay, listen to me. Then you just drive back as fast as you can and tell 'em what's going on, okay? Town is hours away. Then they're hours away, even when I get back to call. They don't care about us. You've said that. It's just you and me. I need to get you out of here and we're going to find Elly. Listen to me. We can't! Okay? It's dangerous here. I don't know if he's coming back. I need you to get back as fast as you can. Try to drive without the headlights. I'm not going to leave you. I'm going to get you out. No, we can't! Listen to me! Get out of here now! No, I am going to get you out! You're the sheriff and I'm your daughter! It's just the two of us and you know it! There's no one else to help! Do you have any rope in your truck? Come on, come on. Okay, this is the number for the deputy in the next county. As soon as your phone starts getting reception, call him and tell him where I'm heading. - What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna follow that guy's car tracks into the canyon and see if I can't find Elly. - Be safe. - You, too. Ride fast. Don't stop for anything. I love you. Hey! Alex? Elly? No! Come on. Let's go. Alex. Come on. Come on. Hang on. He's coming! No! Elly! Elly! Come on. Come on! Come on. No! No, no! No! No! No! Hey! No, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No! No! Elly. Alex!
