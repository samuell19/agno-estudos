Good evening, good afternoon, good morning! Now you see those greetings work two fold. Firstly, because this is an international stream, so we have audience members from all around the world, different countries, different time zones. Hello, And secondly, because I have absolutely no idea what time of day it is anymore. But welcome to the theater, live in your living room. How quaint. Now here at the the Chateau du Theatre Digital. We have slightly different rules to most theaters. For example, we can't ask you to turn off your electronic devices, 'cause you wouldn't be able to watch the darned thing. So instead we ask that you keep them on, you turn them up loud and you tweet along with the show using the hashtag #firstdatemusical. I know, shameless. Speaking of shameless, if there's any single guys out there who might feel lonely after watching this romantic musical, please know that my DMs are open and I am desperate. Now, there will be one brief intermission or as the Brits call it, an interval or wine time. So, enjoy this American musical brought to you entirely by British actors in the middle of a global pandemic. And if you don't enjoy it, well, screw you. We worked so hard. Now, pour yourself a glass of wine, fill your face with snacks, and enjoy the show. Hi. Hey. Are you waiting for a table? You know what? I'm gonna wait and see how the drinks portion of the evening goes first and then we'll see how it goes from there. I don't wanna be too presumptuous. You know what I mean? Well, can I get you something while you wait? Beer, vodka, Xanax? I'll just have a beer please. Yeah, does that sound right? Yes, I will have a beer, thank you. - Do you care what kind? - Just something on tap. In a big glass, a big, big manly glass. - Oh, so this is a first date, huh? - Yeah, is it that obvious? - Well, you got pretty dressed up for it, didn't you? - Yeah, I came from work. I thought the suit would make me seem impressive and or distinguished. Am I wrong? - Honestly, I think it's making you seem desperate and or douche-y. But maybe I'm wrong. - She's gonna be here any second, what am I supposed to do now? - That's okay, relax. Just to get rid of the tie. - Okay, yeah, yeah, tie's going away. Let's lose the tie. A tie going, bye-bye . - I can , thank you. And loose the glasses. - Yeah, okay, . - Wow, we're gonna keep the glasses. - Yup. - And pop the collar a little. - Oh, okay popping, pop again. - And okay. - Okay what? - Honey, that's all I got. Can I help you? - I don't know, maybe it depends. I'm supposed to be meeting some random guy here for a drink. - Oh, you must be the other half of the first date. He's already here. - He is? How is he? 'Cause my sister said he might in fact be the man of my dreams. - She did? Are you and your sister close? - Oh shit, I knew it, okay, be honest. What are we dealing with here? Asks a million questions, guys, super sweaty guy, overconfident guy, what? - No, no, no. I think he's... Well, I'm just gonna to let you decide that for yourself. He's right over there. - Oh, allergy guy, good times. Bring me a shot of something strong, will you? And a chaser of something even stronger. Hi, Casey, you must be- - Hi, Aaron, yes, that's me. Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm- - I know. - Not entirely sure what the protocol is here. - I know. - We can't handshake, we can't hug, so what are we gonna do? - Why don't we just start with the elbow and then see where we go from there, . - Coming in with the elbow, boom. - What is that? What are you doing? - Not entirely sure. Occasionally I'm an idiot. Wanna have a seat? - Yes. - Yes, safer, . Would you like a drink? - Oh, I already ordered two on the way in. Thank you, what are you drinking? - Nothing special, just a brewski. - Did you just say brewski? - Yes I did, . But if it makes you feel any better, I regretted it the second it came out of my mouth. - Are you okay Aaron, 'cause you seem a little nervous? - Yeah, no, do I? Sorry, it's just that I don't go on a lot on blind dates. Actually, this is most definitely my real first. - For Real? - For realsies, so if I seem a little bit nervous it's only 'cause you know, I am. - Well, don't be because the more nervous you get the more I wanna make a mad dash for that door . - Here we go! - Jesus Christ! - One beer for the gentleman. - Thank you. - And one shot for the lady. - Thank you. - And one cocktails for the lady. - Thank you . - So what was that all that about? - It's called taking the edge off. You should try it, BDV, might loosen you up. - BDV? - Blind Date Virgin. That's my new nickname for you, you mind it? - No, well, I prefer something like A-train or Wolverine but- - Good, now BDV, can I ask you a question? - Yeah, sure, ask me anything I'm an open book. - If you've never been on one of these before why go on one now? - Well, Kevin, your sister Lauren's husband- - Aka my brother-in-law? - Right, him. Well, he said that you were really cute and that I would be an absolute moron to pass this up. So I decided to take a risk and listen to him. How about you? - Lauren said you look like Brad Pitt. So do you agree with Kevin? - About what? - Am I really cute? - You can't just ask me that. - Why not? You said you're an open book. So am I? I'm waiting. - Yes you are very pleasant looking. - Ooh, pleasant looking. - All right, okay, fine, no, attractive, desirable, stunningly beautiful. Wait, how about d, all of the above . So how about me? What adjectives would you use to describe me? - Really there's just so many adjectives to choose from I wouldn't even know where to start. - So now what do we do? - What do you mean? - Well, I was just thinking that seeing as I've never been on one of these before and you're kinda the resident expert. I was just hoping that maybe you could instruct me on what we're supposed to do next here. - Who told you I was the expert? - Kevin said something just before he was leaving the office but if he is wrong, then he could be wrong. He's wrong. - No, no he's not wrong- - I'm sorry. - I mean, he's incredibly wrong to tell you that information right before you met me but technically speaking, he's not wrong. Fine, hi, my name is Casey and I'm a serial dater. - Then I have the perfect nickname for you. - Oh really, what's that? - Yeah, BDS. - BDS? - Yes, Blind Date Slut. No, no, I'm so sorry. I was too soon, that is not I want to die. I'm really not good at this whole casual banter thing. Okay, so Casey, do you enjoy blind dates? - Oh God, no. I hate them with an undying passion. I put them right up there with pap smears and M.Night Shyamalan movies. - Well then why do you go on so many? - 'Cause I think it's important to put yourself out there and keep your options open. And I keep hoping that each time my next leap will be the leap home. - You know Quantum Leap? Holy shit, I love Quantum Leap. Oh boy, we're definitely coming back to that one. So have you been on any really bad ones? - First dates? - Yeah. - Oh no, no, sweetie, we're not doing that. Oh, you really do need my help. No, no, no, that's like dating rule number one. It's way too early in the evening for me to be discussing other men with you. - Right, see, I did not know that. Okay, so what should we be talking about? - Well, seeing as we barely know each other I would say this would be the small talk, getting to know you portion of the night. - Okay, okay, okay, okay I can do that. I got you, I got you, you know just nothing too serious. Just keeping it light and breezy. Just like, "Okay, I can do this." So where are you from? - Michigan. - Michigan, oh, sorry, you wanna get that? - No, no, no, it's fine. - Are you sure? I don't mind if you- - No, it's no problem. What were you saying? - Michigan. - Michigan? - Yes. - Hey, it's Casey. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. - So where did you grow up in Michigan? - Just in this little town where everybody knows everybody's business. Hence why I moved New York as fast as humanly possible. West Bloomfield. - Oh, you grew up in West Bloomfield? Holy shit! Hey, do you know anybody that went to Camp Riverlake? - Yes, why, did you go there? - Yes, only for like six summers . - My neighbor, Jessica Sheinwald went there. - Jessica Sheinwald, I think I remember her. - Oh, she only went for one year. She fell in love with this total prick called Gabe and they had this like insanely intense six week like summer romance and then on the last day of camp she found out that he'd been seeing four other girls and the wilderness instructor all summer. Can you believe that shit? - No, was it a Gabe Rubenstone? - Yeah, how did you know? - He's been my best friend since I was four. - Oh, things were just starting to look up for us too. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He was a prick. He still is, he still is. He's just a colossal prick, okay? So we're just gonna forget about him. Move along now . So where did you go to school? - Village Day. - Right, oh, okay. Well, I think a bunch of Riverlake people went there. Do you know Josh Baumgarten? - He sat next to me in our class. - All right, Rachel Hirsch? - I kicked her ass all over the lacrosse field. - Okay, how about Nathan Davidson? - Oh my God, Nathan, wanna see a magic trick Davidson? - Yes. - You knew that freak? - Yes, of no worse, he was my roommate for three summers. Did you have any idea how many times he asked me to pick a card? - Where's did you go to college? - Penn, you? - B.U - B.U, so you wanna keep playing Jewish geography 'cause I can give you like 10 more names. - Oh, we can I'm really good at it. Even if I'm not a Jew. - Sorry, what did you say? - I am not a Jew. - Aaron, bubalah! - Grandma Ida, is that you? - That's right. - What are you doing here? You're dead. - Aaron? - Who are you? - I'm Casey's father. Her very disapproving, very Christian father. - I'm sorry, do you mean her father or her Father? - Both. - Oh my God. - Yo dad, what's up? - Dad! - What? You don't recognize me? I'm yours and Casey's future son and I'm like beyond messed up. So thanks for that. - Well- No, come on. - So you're really not Jewish, uh? - Nope! - Half Jewish? - Uh- uh. - Quarter Jew? - Not even a little. - Okay, so wait, wait, what about relatives? You got like a cousin or a sister, or somebody that got a rebellious and married an Ashkenazi? - Very doubtful, is this a problem for you, Aaron? - No, no, no, not for me necessarily. For some others in my family maybe. Your family or future children that we may or may not have. - Well, if it makes you feel any better, I've never been a big church goer anyway. - Right, you haven't? That means you don't have like countless crosses and Rosemary beads and pictures of political angels hanging right above your bed 'cause I'm gonna be honest with you, that would be kinda a bit deal breaker for me. - No, my parents have never been into any of that kind of stuff. So from a very early age I was always much more of an atheist. - Oh really? So, I mean you don't believe in God at all? - Is this your way of keeping things light and breezy? - Right, yes. Sorry, yes, no. What's your favorite color? - No, no, you're new to this, so I'll allow. - Thank you very much. - To answer your question, I do believe in a higher power but I also think that organized religions have become so overlaid with extraneous matter that I don't know, their spiritual substances has become completely obscure. Do you know what I mean? Okay, check this out. I've been reading a lot of Eckhart Tolle. Ever heard of him? - No- - It doesn't matter. He's a big believer in the power of now. And so since I have a bad tendency of getting in my head, I've been trying to separate the process of thinking and an awareness in an effort to transcend my ego based station state of consciousness. - Right, yeah obviously. That is very, very obvious. - Yeah. - So how's that going? - Not so well. I have a hard time silencing my inner critic. - Oh my God, tell me about it . - Really? - Yes. - You do too? - Yes, my inner critic will not shut up right now. - Okay, what's he saying? - It's saying to get out of this thing as quickly as possible . - Are you're making fun of me? - No. - 'Cause- - No I'm sorry. - You brought this up, I didn't want to talk about. - I was joking, it was a bad joke. - You know what? - I'm sorry. - It's a shame that you're so closed minded because actually I think this stuff would help you. I think the meditation and self awareness could be helpful for you. It could be helpful for everybody. - Yeah, no, you're right, you're right. It could do that for me and all the people all over the world. Look, can I just... I just wanted to say that- - Maybe we- - I'm sorry,. Look, I wanna- - Oh, dear God, you go first. - Okay, look, I'm so sorry, okay? I just misunderstood what you were saying and I messed up. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry for getting so standoffish. It's just, I actually think it's a really good thing getting to know yourself, but every time I talk about it, people look at me like I'm some sort of mental patient. - Yes, you're right. Which is exactly why I will not look at you like that anymore. No more crazy looks from me, okay? - Glad to hear it. - Yes . Oh my God. Did we just totally have our first fight? - OMG, we kinda did. - Oh, girl, we totes did and we came out of it without any cuts or bruises. - Barely any internal bleeding. - Okurrrr. Well, maybe there's a small smidgeon of hope for us yet. - Yeah, maybe. - All right. Well, since we're already in this terribly uncomfortable situation, anything else you wanna tell me before this date continues? Like you got weird fetishes diseases black sheep family members. You can tell me. You can tell me, I will be totally fine with it. - Well, now you mentioned it. There is something I should tell you. - Oh, sure, lay it on me. - I have a four year-old son, Blaze. - Hello! - You do? - Yeah, he's great. He's just the little light of my life. - Wow, Blaze. Is it that, so... So who's the father? - I'm not entirely sure. - You're not? - No, I know it's definitely like between two or three guys but you know what? I figure we can always do DNA testing but that's only if Blaze, absolutely just has to know his birth father. - Right. - Are you my daddy? - Sure, no. That makes sense to me. So what's he like? - Oh, he's very sweet, energetic hyper kid. And he hasn't been officially diagnosed but we think he has ADD. - Oh. - I like basketball and baseball and soccer and drawing and chocolate and pirates, airplanes and French fries, and video games and- - Wow, you must really have your hands fold, Aw, aw, wow, wow, wow! - I do, but you know what? No matter how much he kicks and screams and bites, he does love to bite and cries and fight me on every single thing. At the end of the day, when I'm sitting there breastfeeding and he looks up at me with my nipple on his cute little mouth. - Nipple, you still breastfeed your four-year-old son? - Of course, it really helps a mother-son bond. Anyway, my point is I wouldn't change it for the world. - No, that's great. That is great. I'm just surprised that Kevin neglected to mention anything to me. - Oh yeah, Aaron, there's one other thing I should tell you about Blaze. - Really, there's something else? - He doesn't exist. - Oh, thank God! - I'm messing with you. - Can you imagine having to deal with some fucking monster child who's still old enough to ask his mommy for a tall glass of boob . - He's real. - Let me finish. - I'm joking. - Fuck you, fuck you. Why would you do that to me? - Because it was funny, wasn't it? - Oh my gosh. - Really funny, really got him there, Kudos sis. - Oh, Lauren, what do you want? - I don't know, maybe to help you get married or at least asked out on a second date. You know, I really don't understand you Case, why do you insist on being so- - Daring, bold and delightfully controversial? - I was gonna say harsh, guarded and slightly confrontational, but you know, six-of-one. - I can't help it, that's just who I am. - That's cute. But you know what else you can help? Your biological clock. And if you listen real close to hear what it's saying, "Hurry the fuck up." - No, that's not fair, I've really been trying. - No you haven't. This is all a game to you, a sport. You're not looking for the one, you just looking for new ways to amuse yourself in other people's experience. - You know what? We can't all be like you. We can't all meet our dream guy and settle down in Connecticut at age 24. - That's hurtful. We didn't get our first house in Westport till I was 28, and you know it. Look just do me a favor, try a little harder with this guy 'cause Kevin really likes him. And wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. If he did it someone nice for once. - Fine. - Oh, God, you know what? I think I need another beer. Excuse me, can I get a beer please? Just one, thank you. - Uh oh, did my menace of an imaginary child force you to start drinking again? He does have that effect on people. - Yeah, he really does, you know I was this close to driving my imaginary minivan off of the top of a very steep imaginary place. - Oh, listen Aaron, don't feel bad. I totally get why Blaze would scare you. Well, I mean, we're not all made for breeders, right? Nothing says we have to have children. Am I right? - So you don't wanna have kids? - No, well, definitely yeah, I do, someday. - Yeah, me too. I want a big family actually. Not yet though, but come on, can't you imagine it. Bunch of little Aarons running around, all saying giving off a goffy elbo. - Oh, yeah, on their little suits? - Well, come on! You know it's funny actually, my ex always used to say to me, - Oh no, you don't do it. - No, I don't what Gabe? - Dude, dude, we've been over this like 100 times. You never ever bring up your ex on the first date. - Why not? Allison was such a huge part of my life. - There's just no way you can exclude me from the conversation. - No, no, no, Aaron get her out of your head. I'm begging you. This is not the time to be thinking about Allison. - Okay- - Guess he can't help himself Gabe. I'm simply too wonderful. - She's simply too wonderful. - Bull shit, "Rip off my clothes. Have your way with me." That's not what Allison would say and you know it. Now be honest with yourself. What would Allison really say to you? - Well, you mean like in the bedroom? - Yeah. - Well, I guess I would go a little something more like this and- Allison, wanna have sex? - Sorry, you know the rules. Once the retainer goes in the va-jay-jay's off-limits. - Exactly, don't you see? The real Allison is not the way you choose to remember her. She's a frigid, emotionally manipulative wench that you need to permanently erase from your thoughts. So you can finally move on. - Okay, okay, okay, I got you. Okay, no more Allison, she's out of my head. Now please, what am I doing about my date? Because- - Well, thankfully, you got your best friend here to help you through this. Now, Aaron, do I get ass? - Yes. - Yes, and I'm gonna help you get some too, but only if you listened to your consigliere. So remember you talk about the ex, you can forget about the sex, got it? - Yes got it. Talk about ex, forget about this talk . - Your ex always used to say you what? - Not much, nothing at all actually, she was mute. - Oh. - Can we talk about something else? - Absolutely, let's re-focus. - Oh my God, . - Okay, so I know that guys absolutely love to talk about work. So why don't you regale me with some anecdotes and stories about that? - Oh, no problem. And what do you wanna know? - Well, what you do exactly? - Ah, investment banking, corporate finance and sometimes I fiddle around with mergers and acquisitions. - Oh, sounds riveting. - Yeah, just one, thank you. I know it's the most sexier or fascinating a job but it pays bills. - Yes, but does it fulfill your soul. - It fulfills my sole purpose of making money. - Okay, all right, so you're one of those guys. Is that what it's all about for you, the cash-ola? - Well, it is for now. Anyway, what about you? Kevin told me that you work in an art gallery. Is that always been your lifelong ambition? - No, but it's creative and it's a good place for me to study my craft. - Oh cool, which is? - Photography. - Ah, no way. You're a photographer? - Yes, no, well, no, I used to dabble. I own a camera . - So what do you do at the gallery? You pick up the pieces? - Yeah, sometimes. - Cool. - Why? - Oh no, it's just that I thought the whole Damien Hirst exhibition was awesome. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Wait a minute. How do you know about that? - I may have done some research online before our date. - Oh! - Yeah. - You googled me? - Well, yes, I googled you, but let me explain. I just wanted to let myself know what I was in for before. - And what else did you find out? - What didn't he find out? - I know Google, is that you? Again, why do you always have to ruin everything? - Because I'm the world's number one search engine. That's why, and Casey. - What are you doing? - Well, if you googled me I think it's only fair I google you right back don't you? - No, no, not at all, that's not the rule. You cannot believe everything that you read on here. That's... Can I just... All right, that was a fraternity hazing ritual. That is bad spray tan. That's... No, that's another Aaron Goldfarb. Okay, hotshot, okay, I didn't search had enough the first time. So let's see what other dirt I can find on you. - Wait. - Oh my! - In your high school production of Hello Dolly- - That's bad. - You were Dolly. - How embarrassing. - I went to an All-Boys Academy. And I'll have you know, the school newspaper people call my work "oddly compelling." Wait, can we please just call the truce please? - Okay, - Okay, - Phones down. - Yes back in their holsters. Turn, yes, boom. So we both have things floating around on the internet that we're not proud of. - Yes, and there's no way to get rid of them either. Believe me I've tried. - You know what, I think it's funny, right? The internet is supposed to be this great way of connecting people or whatever. But I actually think that it's doing the opposite. Especially when it comes to dating. - I agree, I think when you can find out everything you would ever wanna know about somebody before meeting them, what's the fun of that? - Right, right. It's like you make all these unfair judgments about someone without ever seeing the person face-to-face. - Or experiencing what it's like to interact with them. - Yes, to hear their voice. - God forbid, maybe touch them. - Would you please explain to me that hand move? - Dude, I can't believe she totally put her hand on you. - What, that, that was nothing. - Yes, I know Gabe. But I'm trying not to make a big deal out of it. So sh. - Look at me Case, now, do you wanna find something genuine and meaningful like I have with Kevin or not? - Yes, I mean, in theory. - You got to start playing it slow. 'Cause landing a quality guy's like a marathon, not a sprint to fuck county. - Dude, whatever it is you're doing, keep doing it 'cause you might actually have a shot with this one. I know I'm as shocked as you're. - Hi, how are we doing over here? - Uh, good, good, I'm good, you good? - Yeah, good. - Everyone's good. Whatever, you good? - Yeah, poop, poop! - Thank you. - Here we go, can I get you guys anything else? - No, you know what? Actually, I'm pretty starving. You wanna grab something to eat? Food's supposed to be real good here. - Could eat something, yeah. - Great, great! - Great! Right this way. - All right, thanks. After you. - Yes. - Hey, hi, how are you doing? You good? This is a Meta-Moment where I directly address the camera. Have you ever been on a first date and you really got to pee but you can't quite work out when to go. Well, I always recommend going in between courses which is right now. So go to the restroom top up your wine, do whatever you got to do. You got three minutes. So I recommend it's only a pee. Ready, steady, go! Yeah, this is literally how we're doing the interval. That's a nice lamp. Got a dead leg already . Do you mind if I don't smile? My jaw's kind of aching . Damn, some nice cushions. Where did they come from, Walmart? No, no. No, no, seriously, I don't get any more interesting than this. Go, go pee, go pee. Gentlemen, only shake it twice, more than twice and you're playing with it. Madam, did you not plan on wearing any clothes for this live stream? I mean it's fine but it's just a little disrespectful. Sir, you be as disrespectful as you want . I love a bichon frise. Hey, what's your name? I'm a dog whisper. Did you do it? I bet you didn't. Now we're two minutes, 16 in. I don't know why I chose that timestamp but it's not particularly important. Now you got 30 seconds left. There's a lot you can do in 30 seconds. Isn't that sir? Should we do a countdown? Okay, we're gonna count down from 10. Ready? Here we go. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Okay, let's get back to the first date. - Thank you. - Here we go. - Thank you so much. - Uh-huh. - Okay, all the best. So, anything jumping out at you? - I don't know. The burger and fries sounds pretty amazing. - Sure it does if you're trying to make weight, right before a big Sumo Wrestling Competition, but not on a first date. - Why not? It shows that I'm confident with my body and I don't have any weird eating issue. - No, it shows him that you have an unusually healthy appetite. And then one day all of this is gonna go away and you're gonna end up on the biggest loser "Gee, I wonder why I'm still single" edition. - That's ridiculous, guys don't think like that. I'm getting the burger. What are you looking at? - I don't know, maybe the chop salad. - No, fuck you, you're not getting that. - What's the big deal? - Salads are for pussies. You're getting a burger, rare. - But I want a salad. - And I want Taylor Swift but you know how I'm not getting her by ordering a sissy salad with my balls on the side, on our very first date. - You're insane, okay? I'm not listening to you. I want to chop salad, remember the chopped salad, okay? - Made any decisions? - I'll have the chop salad, please. - I'll get the burger. - Thank you, coming right up. - Thanks. Salad, what happened? Thought you were gonna get the burger. Hope you didn't order the salad for my benefit, did you? - No, of course not, why would I do that? Well, some girls think that they got to order a salad on the first date. They gonna show the guy that they care about their body or whatever, which I think is completely ridiculous . - You do? - Well, yeah, for sure, I mean if honest I'd rather order some meat and potatoes. Really just get in there, right? But that's just my preference. - So are you telling me that you don't care about how a girl looks? - No, not really, rather she was happy. - For real? - Yeah, for real. I mean it, at the end of the day looks go, but if you still have things in common, and can still make each other laugh, then that's all that really matters, uh? - You have got to be kidding me. - You're not really gonna fall for this bollocks, are you? - Come on guys, leave us alone, you have no right to get in the middle of this. - We have every right to get in the middle of this. - We're your past. - And your future, love. - Look, you guys satisfied a very specific need at a very specific time. But thankfully that phase is over. - You always think it's over. - You like bad boys Casey, not this, it's who you're. - Why fight it? - Tell me, Aaron, have you ever been arrested? - Sorry? - Done any jail time, I'll even count juvie, I'm not picky. - Oh no, no jail time here to visit Alcatraz once. Hey, fun fact. - How about drugs, ecstasy, coke, methamphetamines ever had what people might call problem. - Tried mushrooms in college one night accidentally. That's why I make my own pizzas now. - Random piercings, tattoos, I'll even settle for henna . - No, I'm a little confused by this. Where are these questions coming from? - Listen Aaron, I think you were really sweet. Really put together a guy but I'm usually more attracted to bad boys. - And I guess that means that you think that I'm- - Not a bad boy, which is totally fine. You're who you're. It's just not what I normally go for. - Right, yeah. But I may not be a bad boy in the traditional bad boy sense of the word. But that doesn't mean that I've never done anything bad before. - Have you? - Yeah, there's a lot of layers here. We've been talking for what? Like an hour? That's barely scraping the surface of who I really am. - All right, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. How about you tell me something bad that you've done. - Yes, gladly. You mean now? Okay, fine, something bad. Okay, got it. One nightstand, done it. This guy, okay, boom! - Have you? - Yes Casey, I have. Can you just define exactly what nightstand means? You wanna get your phone? - Absolutely not, I'd rather stick with this. - You can get it. I don't mind if you get your phone. - Yeah, see, that's what this amazing new invention called "voicemail's" for. Now, let me clarify. - Hey, It's Casey. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. - My definition of a one night stand is meeting some random girl in a bar, having your way with her and then never seeing her again. Is that what you did? - No, no, not exactly. - Who was she? - She was my next door neighbor all of growing up. But it affected our relationship in a bad way, so- - Listen, Aaron, I appreciate the effort but I think before this date goes any further, I think we should just admit that this is maybe not a love connection, - But- - No, you're really, really great guy. And I think there's a perfect girl out there for you. It's just... What I'm trying to say is I really think we should be- - Okay, sorry. Hold on one second. Did I miss something? Because I was actually under the impression that the state was going pretty well, but now the meal, isn't it even here yet, and she is about to put me smack dab right in the middle of the friend-zone. Do you have any idea what that means? - The friend-zone is for platonic relationships only no grouping. - And here we go. - The friend-zone is for last-minute party advice because the guy she really likes can't make it. No oral pleasure. - How did I end up here? Again, sure, maybe there were a few things that I could've done differently. But just to thrust me back into the- - The friend-zone is for emotional support, self-esteem boosting and torturous mind games, no penetration. - It just seems a little harsh, right? I just don't get it. I'm always destined to be that guy, sweet, the ever faithful, loyal, dependable buddy. Dear God, I'm not a man, I'm a fuckin' puppy . - I'm sorry, what did you say? You just wanna be my- - Friend, I think we should be friends. - Uh, no, thank you for that kind offer Casey. It's a lot to think about, so thank you because who doesn't need more friends, right? 'Cause friends are the flowers in the garden of life. So let's just plant the seed of friendship and see how it... Can you just excuse me for one second, I'm gonna go to the bathroom and try and drown myself in the urinal, okay. - So tell me, how's it feel being a relationship assassin? - Lauren, give it a rest. - I just don't understand, you claim to want what Kevin and I have, but when you find a guy who could actually give you all those same things, you totally sabotage it. - I know, I have a problem. - You really do. What does your therapist say about this? - Blah, blah, blah. - Blah, blah, blah, fear of commitment. - Can you be a little more specific? - Not really 'cause that's pretty much exactly what I hear in my head every time I talk to him. - Okay, then just talk to me. I'm your sister, and even I don't get it. - Get what Lauren? - These walls you put up. We're family and I can't even begin to break through this hard exterior of yours. - Well, keeping you at arms length. I do consider one of my most crowning achievements. - Joke, all you want, we both know all this bravado is really just you being afraid of getting hurt. I mean, let's be honest. The same thing that happened with your photography show. - It wasn't ready. - No, you weren't ready 'Case you had all these amazing photos and a gallery that was willing to exhibit anything you wanted to give them. And right at the last second, you backed out. It's the same thing with every single guy in your life. There's always some reason or another lame excuse as to why things don't work out over and over- - Okay, Lauren, I get it. Hey, you're back? - Yeah, I'm. But you know what? Not for long, I'm gonna head out. - Dinner hasn't come yet. - Yeah, I know friend, but no, it's getting kinda late friend. So I'm just gonna skedaddle out of here. - Okay, I get it. You're a little mad at me right now. - No, no, no, no, I'm not mad at you because friends don't get mad at friends, friend. So I'm just trying to process and adjust to this new form of friendship. So I just feel like I need to do that by myself. That's all Friend-o. - Yeah, fine, great, let's get the bill. - Finally, something we can agree on, Mazel Tov. All right, if only we could find that frickin' waiter. 'Cause he's always here, apart from when we need him, friend. - Thank you Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, please sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. Sit, thank you. Now as some of the regulars here already know I do a little writing and performing on the side. Very little. That's why I've been stuck in this rat hole for way too long . I'm kidding, I'm kidding. There are no rats. We use them all in the bolognese, I'm still kidding. Still, if you'd indulge me for the next few minutes I'd like to share with you my latest musical extravaganza. Hit the lights, Jorge. This goes out to all the lover and future lovers out there. I'm looking at you table four. - Oh my God. - Sweet Jesus. - That was my Nathan lane. Okay . - Well, that wasn't too awkward. Kinda like when my dad chaperoned the sock Hop in Junior High and forced me to slow-dance with him. Oh, you think that's funny. Oh yeah, great, I'm glad I amuse you. - Here we go, one chop salad for the lady and one manly burger for the gentleman. - Yeah, thank you, but actually, you know what? I don't think we're good. - Okay, I think you're being a little over-dramatic. The food's here, I think we can enjoy one meal together. - Fine, fine, one very quick meal. - Bon appetite. - So BDS, what are we supposed to talk about now? - What do you mean? - I just mean, usually on your other blind dates, once you've destroyed guy's spirit and then question your overall attraction to the man and then let them know in no uncertain terms that they do not have a snowball's chance in hell of hooking up with you. What do you talk about next? - All right. - The weather? - All right, the way I see it is you have two options. You can sit here and be angry guy for the rest of the meal or you can turn that frown upside down and take advantage of this golden opportunity. - Oh, this golden, what golden opportunity are you talking about exactly, uh? - I apologize if my obvious lack of tact and blunt, honesty offended you. But, I happen to know lots of single eligible, attractive women. And if you play your cards right, I could be the one who sets you up for your soulmate. - She has lots of single women. - You know lots of single women? - Tons of 'em and they're crawling all over the city. - Okay, fine, yeah, really, I mean maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way. I see we go over this like we just met, right? There's no history here, we got nothing, right? So if it's not you or me, then maybe it's me and- - Countless others. - Okay, okay, okay, I'm game, right? Who do you got in mind? - Well, it depends what's your type? - I don't know, not too specific, maybe just... - Didn't I tell you to leave Allison out of this? - Okay, right, yes, you're right, sorry. Moment of weakness, won't happen again . You know what, I'm not picky, you decide. - Okay, so do you want a good girl who you can take home to mom and dad or do you want a more adventurous rebellious girl who's definitely way more fun in the sack. - Oh, wow, you know what? I think Dad would be thrilled with either at this point. - But what about mom? - That's hard to say. - Oh, why, will you always be her adorable widdle boy and no girl will ever be good enough for you? - Nope, it's not that- - Could you not let you go? Is she one of those overbearing Jewish mothers who just- - My mom is dead Casey. She passed away when I was in 10th grade before that she was so driven and career obsessed that I hardly ever saw her. - Wow, I feel like a total jerk. - Oh no, no, no, it's fine. - I guess I just assumed that- - What, that I came from some perfect drama-free home? Yeah, I've been picking up on that. - So how did... Sorry, do you mind talking about this stuff? - Oh, it's not really first date material, is it now, Casey? But hey, since we're no longer on first date, it's ripe for discussion. - What happened? - Well, she was born with a defect in one of the valves in her heart which most people can live with their entire lives but she had a pretty stressful demanding job with a law firm, which probably definitely made it worse. And then by the time that she started showing symptoms it was pretty severe. So they rushed her for emergency surgery and I guess there were a few complications and... And why am I telling you this? - Because I'm a good listener. And if I haven't shown it tonight, the dark secret about me is that I'm actually very sensitive. Did you get to say goodbye? - Yeah, briefly. But it was at the hospital. So it was rushed and we didn't know what was gonna happen. You know what the crazy part? Is that a couple of days later I was going through my sock drawer looking for a matching pair socks to wear to the funeral and I found a letter that she had written me, right before she left for the hospital. She must have thought that there's a chance that she wasn't coming back, so- - What did the letter say? - I don't wanna make the same mistakes my mum did, Casey. I won't make the same mistake she did. - What about this whole getup? All the hard work, it sounds like you're doing the exact same thing. - Nope, nah, I don't care about any of that stuff. None of any of this, that's just my job. That is not me. I just wanna learn as much money as I can now so that I do not have to miss out on anything like that. You're pretty popular tonight, uh? Get it, please, I don't mind. - No. - No, go. - Not at all. - Hey, it's Casey. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. - Wait, hold on. Stop the music, stop the music! I don't wanna sing anymore. Okay, shit. Listen up bitch. What's the deal? 'Cause this is like my third unreturned phone call tonight which is starting to make me seem desperate. And Reggie doesn't do desperates. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but did we not agree when we met doing karaoke and bonding over, "Love is a battlefield" that we would be best friends forever? Well, I'm pretty sure BFFs pick up the phone when the other BFF calls, right? I mean, What's going on? One date and you're already choosing him over me! Could it really be going that well? Or did he shove you into the back of his creepy white van and your phone's lying in a ditch at the side of the road somewhere? Oh my God, you're not dead, are you? Oh my God, you're totally dead. It seems to me, we have two options here, either A you're having a wonderful time and purposely choosing to ignore the real love of your life, or B you're totally dead and he's making a dress out of your skin at this very moment. Either way, you've left me with no other option but to come to the restaurant. So just to wrap up, I hope you're alive. And I very much look forward to the scene that I'm about to cause. Oh, and later skank. - All right, okay, you can stop staring at me with your mouth hung up open like that, all right? You're starting to make me feel like a freak. No, it's just, I'm rarely surprised by somebody and you just totally surprised me. - Why, 'cause my mom died? Let me tell you, that is nothing, all right? Wait until you hear about my new just uncle Harry and my kleptomania cousin, Carol, because them, some stories. - No, I'm surprised by how open and honest you just were. Most people build up walls and are not like that. - Yeah, well, I told you I'm an open book, wasn't lying. How's the salad? - Oh, good, yeah. You want a bite? - Yeah, sure, you want a bite of this? - All right, yeah. - All right, cool, get in there. Take that, I'm gonna do this. That's coming in here, a little coming. Oh good, very, very good. Wanna do a little swapsies? - I'm game if you're. - Game on, let's do it Put this here, give me your fork. And I'm gonna steal this little pickle spear and I'll show you what I do. - Am I going crazy, or am I starting to dig this guy? And don't say it's because he played the dead mom card 'cause I really don't think that's it. Believe me I'm starting to like puke in my mouth as I say this but I actually think he's got a really good heart. And despite his obvious lack of bad boy standing there's a definite charm and strangely attractive quality to him. Could it be that I am... Maybe sort of in a roundabout way into him? - Oh, I love pickles. All right, so come on, I'm waiting, anybody springing to mind? - For what? - To set me up with. - Oh, yeah that. - Yeah, right? - Right... Okay, well there's my friend Nina. - Nina, Nina, Nina, what's she like? - Actress, a little cray-cray, touch of the bipolar, but so sweet. - Right, well, with a recommendation like that, who else you got? - There's Trish, super-cute, super-clingy. Girl meets a guy and just clings on for dear life, like a perky little barnacle if you're into that kind of thing. - You know what? I do prefer my barnacles a little less clingy, you know? - Okay, well I have this new friend called Allison. That could actually be quite good. - Sorry, did you say Allison? - Yes, she just got out have a relationship but she's ready to start dating again. - What's her last name? - What is her last name? Allison... Allison... Weaver, Allison Weaver. - Wow, thank God. - Why do you know her? - No, I just thought you're gonna say someone else. - Who? - Allison- - Aaron, I want you to think very carefully, before you do this. - Zuckerman, Allison Zuckerman, yeah. - Who's Allison Zuckerman? - Yeah, Aaron who is Allison Zuckerman? - She's just a girl that used to be my fiancee. Allison Zuckerman used to be my fiancee, yes. - What's the point in imagining me if you're not gonna listen to a freakin' word I say! - Oh, I didn't know you were engaged. Wait, was she the girl who was mute? - No, that would be wishful thinking . - Wow, so how close were you to getting married? - Pretty close I'd say. - Had you sent out the invitations? - Yeah, yeah gifts had been bought, band been booked. and people were taking their seats if memory serves. - No, she left you on your wedding day? - No, well, she left me standing there all alone under the chuppah . - Why would she do that? - I don't know. Although I found her sprinting off in the parking lot and she did say one thing to me. - Which was? - Sorry, Aaron, I just can't do this. - I just can't do this? - Yep. - What is this girl's address? 'Cause I am in the mood to cut a bitch. - No, no, come on, I'm sure she had her reasons. - Whatever reasons she had, you don't do that to someone. What was the last time you saw her? - 14 months, two weeks and three days or something like that . - Wow. - Yeah, no there was pressure on the both of us, Okay? So it's fine. - Why are you defending her? Are you still in love with her? - No, not, God, no, all right? I just... I don't know, I never got any closure. And maybe there was a part of me that thought, "Well, she would change her mind. She'd come running back to me." But I guess I get... That's why I haven't really dated anyone or even gotten close to anybody since she left. - Wait, are you trying to tell me that you haven't kissed anyone since Allison? - Oh, well that's a very complicated story but the short answer is no. - A long answer? - Also no. - Okay, right, what I want you to do, is imagine that she was here, right here right now. - What, no, why? No . - No, no because we have to get you past this. This is something I did in therapy for years and me and my dad have had so many productive conversations like this. Okay, can you see her? - Not so much. - Oh, come on Aaron, work with me here. Imagine that she was dressed the same way that you might've been the last time you saw her. Can you do that? Can you see her now? - Yeah, you could say that. - Okay, now I want you to say everything you've waited 14 months, two weeks and three days to say to her. Don't hold back. - Hello, Allison. - Hey, Aaron. There's something you wanna say to me? - No, I- - Come on you can do this. - Yes, actually, I... Yes I do. Is that too much? - Not enough. - Okay. You're doing great. - How did that feel? - So good, great like I feel alive again, like rejuvenated and energized, like a giant soul sucking bitch weight has been lifted off my chest, you know? Whoa! - See, I told you so. - I've never been so proud of you in my whole entire life. It's like the pupil has become the teacher. - Hi. - How are we doing over here? - Oh, we're good, thank you. - Are you guys finished? - Yeah, I think we're. - Well, can I get you guys anything else this evening? Dessert, coffee, another food-related production number? - No, no. - No, no. - Thank you. - Your loss, here you go. - Why don't I get this? - No, no, please let me. - Should we split it? - No, because I think this may be the one thing that I have over all of your exes. So please, please just let me have this. - Thank you, Aaron. - You're welcome. You know what? I may be setting myself up here for some hardcore rejection but I am feeling rather empowered right now. So fuck it. I don't wanna go out with your friends, Casey. I wanna go out with you. Now listen, we have a great rapport. I mean, we both love Quantum Leap, right? And in a brief time, you've helped me help with my ex drama. Now I know this may sound crazy but I actually think that your particular brand of edgy and a creative might actually be good for me. And I think that my particular brand of structure and stability might actually be good for you. And I know, oh wow, I know that I am not usually the guy that you would go out with but you know that hasn't worked out so much in the past. So maybe it's time to try something different. So, Casey, what do you say? - All right, buddy, good try. But I think you got your answer. Let's wrap this thing up. - Okay, tell you what? Here, you have my number. If you wanna hang out again, you let me know. If not, thank you for a very memorable evening. - Did you just let him walk out of here? Because I'm pretty sure you just let him walk out of here. Why did you let him walk out of here? - Everything all right? - No, not at all. - Oh my God. - Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm looking for my friend. Attractive dress, kind of funky, wordly inconsiderate. She told me she was meeting some random guy here for a drink. - Oh, but you just missed them. - Okay, a quick question. Did she look like she was having the time of her life or did she was fighting for her life and just so you know if you're wrong, her blood is on both of her hands! - All right, look, I don't know exactly what's going on here but why don't you take a seat and try to calm down? - That's a good idea, I guess I get a little worked up sometimes. People tell me I have a very vivid and overactive imagination. - Oh, don't we all? - You do too? - Who, me? Oh, well, well sure. I'm always dreaming something up. Some new recipe or a useless invention. I even write some songs and a little love poetry on the side. - Really? - Mm-hm. - Hey, can I hear some? I'm Reggie - I'm available. - Hi, remember me? I'm the girl a few minutes ago who just let you walk out the restaurant without saying goodbye. - Yeah, that sounds vaguely familiar. - Oh, here I am. - Here you're, you're lost? Is that what this is of you? Wait, did I leave something in the restaurant other than my dignity? - I thought that you might walk me home if you want, no pressure. - Sure, I'd love to. Just wait, I just got to do a little limber here. You can never be too safe, you wanna get in on this? - No, I'm good. - You should do the hips as well, you did? You're ready? - No, no, yes. - After you. - All right. - Wait, you don't live in Hoboken? - No, just around the corner. - Oh, well, that is great. That is... That is great. - Quit stalling and tap that shit already. Okay, you're gonna give him one quick kiss on the cheek but that's it, V-town is close to the public tonight. Got it? - Do you who hates you? The entire male species. - It's a definite possibility. Blah, blah, blah more therapy. - Well, this is my place. - Oh, big building, excellent structural engineering, bricks and the columns. - Thank you, I designed it my self. - All right... Goodnight. - Goodnight Aaron.
