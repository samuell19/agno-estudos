Good morning Good morning, Ms Ota. No, no. I’m Shimizu’s daughter. Oh, that’s right, Ms Shimizu... What’s that? Today is National Foundation Day. Oh, yeah. Though that was last month, right? ...I forgot In my life, I will see three emperors. Showa… Heisei… and the new one. That’s right... next year the Emperor will abdicate. I completely forgot. Oh! I remember! Your father is a good man. He has true Japanese spirit! He works hard and endures a lot. Especially since your mother passed away. I have to go make him breakfast now. Are you OK to get home by yourself? Yes, I remember the way. Only us old ones remember the way now. The era will change soon… I wonder what the next one will be like? Nothing will change. We’ve already passed the peak. There are no jobs, and noisy, foreign tourists flood Kyoto. And your mother… Dad... I’m OK. Eat up, you’ll be late for work. I'll make some tea. Did you buy these sweets? They look expensive… Mayuko is coming over. Her tea shop is closed today. I see. How many customers did you have yesterday? We had no one yesterday. But I have some later this week. Winter is very slow… Summer was slow too though, and autumn… I hate to see you carrying this burden. We should sell this house to an investor, and move somewhere cheaper. And then you could go back to work. I can’t let Mum’s hard work be for nothing! I think this shop still has potential. You might call them noisy, but Mayuko has many foreign customers. I will ask her for advice. It will take more than advice. Our kimonos are old, and no one knows we’re here. Here, take this. I’ve been saving it for an emergency. Use it. Dad! Don't keep money in a box in the house. It’s not that much. That’s all we have. Use it to buy some new kimono, or fliers. Something for the shop Dad... Anyway, I’m off. Your cooking is delicious as always. Don’t change that, OK! I wish things didn't change. “May many customers come to my shop” - Ami Shimizu I always feel so calm after drinking tea. It’s so nice being here again. I remember your mother teaching us. She was such a good teacher. She was strict... I haven't done real tea ceremony recently. Just a short version for the tourists. I don't do it in Japanese lately, either! Do you do tea ceremonies in English? Yes. But is it really a good thing to change it? I think it’s better to do it properly? It doesn’t bother foreign guests. Their happiness is my main concern. They don't know what they're missing... It’s just the way it is… I can always enjoy it properly with you. Thank you for coming today. I hardly see you anymore since you moved over to Kiyomizu Dera. I know. it was so hard to leave this neighbourhood. I miss my old shop, and seeing you. But it really was a good decision. I have so many customers now. Just as the consultant said. Consultant? Yes, he suggested I move. And helped my shop be foreigner friendly. Even now in winter, I'm so busy. Actually, I thought I might introduce him. Really? Ooh, nice timing! I’m sorry, please go ahead. OK. Nice to meet you. It’s a pleasure. I’m Hayato Arai. I do business consultation. Please accept my card. I'm Ami Shimizu. It still feels a bit cold today. Like it’s winter still. I’m quite warm in my kimono. Mayuko said you are helping with her shop and she’s become very successful. It's all thanks to her hard work. But it was challenging. Kyoto is full of tea houses and kimono rental shops, too. The market is already saturated. It's difficult to break in. But there are so many tourists recently. Then if you’re struggling to get customers, let’s consider the problem with your shop. The location? Your product? Your marketing? Or your service? I don’t think it’s a problem with the shop. Ami, do you really want to fix the problem? If you can’t consider these questions, it will be hard for me to consult for you. I’m sorry to have kept you waiting. Did you have a good chat? Are you OK? That man is far too direct! Is he always like that? Sometimes. But he’s refreshing, don’t you think? He’s just rude! How can you trust him? But he works very hard. He’s the type that likes challenges. I can’t imagine he’ll be around forever. In any case, he gets results. If you want to keep working, consider it. Welcome! Tenants wanted. Good morning. Good morning. Can I come in? This is my shop. My mother, grandmother, and my great grandmother’s shop. It has been here for centuries. If you changed location... The kimono in this shop were made by my grandfather and great grandfather. Those are the kimono I rent. So, you won’t change the product either? Can I come in? How many customers did you have this month? Four. Four? How many in your busiest month last year? Sixteen. Sixteen? You own the house, and you have no staff, so overheads must be low. Yes, but, my father and I have no savings. If I can’t make a profit this year, I will need to sell my house and get a job. You have a pretty garden, and a beautiful, traditional house. It must be nice to live here. Except that the floor squeaks, you mean? And the moss is too green, right? I never said that but... But the ceiling is too low for foreigners? It’s cold in winter and hot in summer? And it’s not by the bridge in Gion? Can I speak? You are far away from tourist areas, but this could be an advantage! The streets here are quiet and traditional. However, it will be hard just as a rental shop. But, if you became a photo studio for tourists, I think we could make it work. A photo studio? Yes. But I’ve never taken photos before... Are you willing to try? I’ll show you how to use it next week. It’s not that hard once you get used to it. Can I show you? Hold on a sec... the settings seem to have changed. I don’t think I can use that camera. I have an idea! I can build a photo frame in my garden. Then guests can just take selfies. What do you think? Um... If you want... But I think it might affect the ambiance... I'm joking. Anyway, there's some nice scenery there. I mean, it’s not such a bad idea. It was a joke! It’s so peaceful along here. And the weather is so nice today. Spring is the best season, don’t you think? It’s quiet now, but when the cherry blossoms were out, we were all drinking in the school grounds. It was noisy then! School grounds? Like an actual school? Is that OK? Well, no children go there now. It closed maybe 5 or 6 years ago. I miss the noisy energy of the children. Do you have children? I’m not married. I'm sorry. It's not a Japanese style question to ask. Where was your foreign parent from? Me? Australia. But I was born in Uji. Uji? That's nice. Really? Have you been to Uji? No. Even though it’s in the same prefecture? Well, I mean, Uji is pretty far away. It's basically Nara. Hold on a second. I think you're only half joking. But it seems like a good place to grow up. Maybe. It didn't really match me. Really? Did you live in Australia? Yes, but, it didn't really match me either. How about Kyoto? I don’t know about Kyoto yet. Can a country boy like me fit into Kyoto? Good point. Maybe Nara then? Wait a second... Can you move back a bit? There! Can I just fix your hair? OK, I’ll take another. What do you think? Pretty, right? I look so different! You don't like it? You’re a really good photographer. Thanks. Now it’s my turn to be the model. What's wrong? Surprised I know how to do it? A little... Did you ask for something? That I become a better photographer. And for my business to do well. What about you? I prayed you get better at photography too. This is my old school. Good memories? Yes… So many. Mayuko came here too, but it closed soon after she graduated. Mayuko? Oh, Ms Yamamoto? My client? Yes. She lived nearby and learned tea ceremony from my mother, and how to wear kimono from my grandmother. And now you both do cultural experiences. Yes. Mayuko had her shop just over there... until recently. Until I told her she should move... Your school closed, and your friend moved. I know this neighbourhood is special but... You don't understand. If a place doesn't suit, you just move! This place is very important to me. I can't be like you, or Mayuko, and easily move here and there! It isn't easy. It's never been easy! You have good memories of school. I don't. I moved when I couldn’t endure it anymore. Ms Yamamoto's business was dying, and now she can barely take a day off! That's what you want, isn't it? I just want it to be like before. Everything was better before. I was happy before. You can feel that way again. That’s why I pray. Praying is fine, but don’t just wait, and endure. Take control. Now are you sure you want to continue? You're under no obligation. I want to try. In that case I’ll set up your website and organize some online advertising. We're already going to start advertising? Better practice, Ami! Don’t get the wrong impression! That camera is just a loan. Later! So rude... No, wait... "Refreshing". Hey, excuse me. Could you take a photo of us? A photo? Yeah! That's great! My camera...? Sure! Huh? You’re home so early! It’s a Friday half day. The boss said to leave early. That's great! Oh, by the way… Here it is! This guy here is my coworker. He is a good man and will be promoted soon. He’s also single... and the second born son. He would be a good husband. Arranged marriages aren’t common anymore, but your mother and I were happy. I just don’t want you to be lonely. I’m not lonely. I have you. Even so... Keep it… think about it. Hello? What? A foreign customer? OK... Ami? We’ll go out for the photo shoot soon. Would you go get the camera? Sorry about that. Thanks! Ami? Ami, what's wrong! Are you OK? I can't do it. I can't speak English! Calm down! This won't work if you don’t trust me. I’m your business consultant, right? We can do this. I’m going to be your bridge. My bridge? Yes, between you and the customer. Sometimes they’ll come over to your side, and sometimes you’ll go to their side. But I’ll be the one in the middle translating, explaining, connecting. But you’re not always going to be here. I’ll show you how to do it. A few, basic English words are all you need and the rest is body language. It’s the common language, right? We've got this. OK, take a deep breath. Breathe in. Breathe out. Smile. We can do this, right? Let's go. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Take care. Good job! How do you feel? I survived. No way! You were great! Really? Thank you! I couldn’t have done it without you. I'm sure you got at least 2 or 3 good shots that aren't blurry or cutting her head off. Just as I'm starting to like you… Coming! Long time, no see! Come in! It feels like no time has passed at all. I know! Thanks. I can’t believe you’re back in Japan! Me too! I thought you’d live in Germany forever. I miss it a lot. In summer there, everyone goes to the parks kids and adults, having fun, making noise. The park over there has a big sign saying, “Residential area, be quiet!” Poor kids! True! Anyway... How is your business going? I've done kimono photo shoots for months now Wow! That’s really different! It's tough, but the shop is getting more popular. Tomorrow, I have a really busy day. Lots of customers? Yes, but my business consultant will help. Business consultant! So professional! He doesn’t come out every day. But he works very hard for me- I mean, he works hard for the shop. But he’s half Japanese and he talks to me like a friend. Is that a bad thing? I’m getting used to it. He’s really thoughtful. He’ll make tea for me when we're finished And he likes to make people laugh, so the customers are always happy. It’s fun having him around. Did he grow up overseas? No, he was born in Japan. But not in Kyoto. Actually, he often gets frustrated with the way things are done in Kyoto. Kyoto does have a lot of rules. I’m really worried that my husband will get culture shock when he comes here. Oh, Ben is coming here? Did you think we broke up? It’s kind of the opposite... Actually... I’m pregnant! Really! Really. Congratulations! Thank you. When is it due? Next spring. I’m so nervous. Mum moved back to Kyoto a few years ago, but I wish we could have stayed in Okinawa. and been close to its foreign community. I’m worried how my child will fit in here. But Kyoto will be their home. Maybe… If your family hasn't been in Kyoto forever then you're an outsider. People will call my kids “foreigners”, and the kids won’t want their Dad at school events. I'm so worried. It will be OK. Everyone will love your baby. Will they? Anyway, half kids are always super cute. Is that right? So, is he? Who? Your business consultant! Koko! Ooh, I think he is! You're blushing! I am not! Is that a phone? Hold on. Oh, was it yours? Yes. Did you want to go out to a cafe? I can’t drink coffee, but I can still eat cake! Oh… I can’t. I have a meeting this afternoon. A meeting? Is it with that business consultant? It's not like that! We have a big day tomorrow, that's all. Work meeting? Seems suspicious. It's not like that! It's just work! Really? Stop it! Ami, you are good at this game! But, I won't give up. OK, it's my go... Never have I ever... played a shamisen. Drink! Drink! But without alcohol this drinking game feels like it's missing something. It's hard to get drunk on tea... OK, my turn! Never have I ever... been to Australia! That's a little unfair. Will you say Uji next, huh? Drink up! OK, my turn again... I'm in danger of losing! OK, here goes. Never have I ever... performed a traditional dance... What's it called...? I'm not going to say it. Oh! So you do dance? What's it called? A traditional dance in Kyoto. Got it! Jiuta-mai! I knew it! I can't believe you know Jiuta-mai. I saw a poster the other day. I've never seen it performed. But it looks beautiful and traditional. It is... A shamisen plays, and the fan moves like this... The dance is slow, but... I think it is beautiful. I would like to see it. I can’t believe I did that! I think I got drunk on tea... No, no, it was really good. Thank you. OK, now it's my turn again. You have to try harder this time. Never have I ever... made origami... Both of us have done that! Wait! Wait. Made origami for someone special! What? You have? Yeah, it was kind of a high school thing. Where was she from? Was your school in Australia or Japan? Australia. Are you trying to get more information? No, no! Australia seems nice to grow up in. It was. The beaches are beautiful and it's easy to relax there. But you said it didn't match you? I mean, I had fun there. But, they said, "Go home." So, I went. Anyway, you won! Wait a moment. Finished! How did you get so confident? How? I can read the mood. I take chances. "May today go smoothly" Ami Shimizu 2018 is the anniversary of the Meiji Restoration so what kimono do you have that implies… revolution? I’ve heard that Kyoto people give ochatsuke when they want someone to leave. Have you done that? I haven't yet... Would he leave if we gave him ochatsuke? Shall I go make some? I'm home! You’re back so early! Is this a customer? No. He’s my business consultant. He’s giving me advice on the shop. It's nice to meet you. Here is my business card. I am Hayato Arai, a business consultant. It’s a pleasure to meet you. How many customers did you have today? Ten! That’s great news! Foreigners? That's amazing! This calls for a celebration! Let's have a drink! I’m so sorry, but I have to refuse. My apologies. I will walk him to the bus stop. You spoke so politely to my father I thought it was a different Hayato Arai. I don’t want him to have a bad opinion of me but actually, I hate being that formal. It feels like a wall between me and others. I can't express myself properly. You're complicated, huh… I guess. Sometimes I even fight with myself. I think, "Ah, that’s so Australian!" or, “Why am I being so Japanese?” But you want to be a “bridge” between them? I want to be. But, I also wish I could find that bridge. A bridge to connect the two sides of me. Or even a map to that bridge. That's something I admire about you. You make strong decisions about your shop. Though it makes my job more difficult. Sorry! I just never imagined being anywhere else. Even though now it’s much emptier, without my mother and my friends. Do you think about her a lot? All the time. I see her walking along these streets. I feel her with me in the kitchen when I’m cooking for my father. When my parents split, and my father left for Australia, I felt like that too. I wanted to hold onto the memories tightly. They were more precious to me than what was around me. You don’t need to wait with me. I’ll see you tomorrow. There'll be more guests to show kimono. OK. I’ll practice my English tonight. I can’t wait to hear your progress. What's wrong? Are you worried about the neighbours? Everyone knows me here… I don’t want rumors to start. Got it. See you tomorrow. Ami, the next customers have just arrived. You should come to greet them. In a moment I’ve got to take this to the last group, and say goodbye to them. Can your father do it? We don't have much time today. No way. Making tea is not my job. Come on, you can't just hide back here. Can't I? Look, this is Japan. It might be different in other countries, but in Japan, men don't serve tea. Then why don't you be the first? I don't even know how to do it. The customers will laugh at me! Ami is putting in so much effort just to keep this place running. Aren’t you going to help even a little? Aren’t you embarrassed to be hiding here? I don’t think your dad likes me. He just likes things the way they are. He's not a big fan of change. Sounds like someone I know... He's trying his best. He worked at this shop with my mother but we made no money so now he's at a company. He is too old though, so it’s all temp work. I think it hurts him to see us having fun when he’s working so hard. That sounds tough. I couldn't do that. Mayuko said something like that. Eh? Mayuko? Ms Yamamoto? Said what? She said you change your mind quickly. How is her shop doing anyway? Oh, I don't seen her much now. I’ve been reducing my clients recently. By the way, let’s meet outside of work one day. We could go somewhere different? Somewhere not here? Yes! Exactly! Well... How about Uji? I’ve always wanted to ride in a river boat. Like something out of the Tale of Genji. Typical. You don't want to? No, no. It sounds good. Let's go! We can float into the sunset together. I'd like that. Let's do it. Dad? What's wrong? Did something happen? Hayato is right. I’m no use to you. Don’t listen to him. I know you’re working hard. They fired me. When? A few weeks ago. And you've been pretending to go to work? I’m still looking for other jobs, but... so far nothing. I should have taken better care of things. But the shop is doing well, right? We have so many customers now. This is pretty boring. The color... I don't even like the fabric. I like that one. This is a little brighter. But there are no… bright patterns on it. How about this? That's a good one! I like the flowers. However, the background color is so boring it’s like it’s for old people. I like those ones with the long sleeves. And something like what I’m wearing. This is so bright and beautiful, full of patterns and flowers… Actually those kimono are for the Coming of Age ceremony. What? Let’s see what Ami thinks… Ami? I’m so sorry. she’s just gone to find some kimono. I’ll just go help her. Sorry. Ami, I'm sorry. She's insistent. Someone of her age in a 20 year old's kimono? Everyone will laugh. She has no idea how ridiculous she’ll look. I understand your concern, but no one will notice details like that. Just let her do it. No! She’s come to Japan, to experience Japanese culture. She can’t just pick and choose and change it to suit herself. This is my shop. You are my consultant. Please tell her that she can choose a kimono that is correct for her age. I’m not always going to cross the bridge. Fine. Smile! One more. Ami. Can I have a minute? I have to go. I have somewhere else to be. Hayato. What? About before... Your customers are waiting. Anyway, I'll take my leave... What are you people doing! Don't pull the branches! Calm down! The customers-- Let's talk about this. This is all your fault. This is my home! This is where I live! These people are noisy! They make a mess! Get them out of here! You should be ashamed! You don't own this street! You're the one who should be ashamed. What’s this foreigner saying? Go home! Home? Where should I go? Hayato! You aren’t helping! Take the customers back to the house. I’m not going to leave you with this guy. I'll be fine! Hurry! I’m sorry. I should have done better. It's OK. He just needed someone to listen to him. I will be aware of my neighbours in future. Guys like him keep Japan stuck in the past​ Hayato... if you can’t understand… the neighbours around here are… Ami, you can’t make excuses for them! Just stop. You say you want to be a bridge, but all you've ever been is a battering ram. Ami! Hello? Oh, you’re back from Tokyo? Not well... What? ...sure, I guess. Long time, no see. You let your beard grow out. This? Is it an issue? No, not really... Thanks for coming today. How is the shop? Actually... It's not doing well. I still have customers. But my father still hasn’t found work. Next week some investors will come around to talk to us about selling. I think they want to make a guest house. A guest house? Then what will you do? I will look for work. Mayuko offered me a job at her tea shop. Anyway, what did you want? Nothing really. I just wanted to see you. We never talked after that day. Do we need to? Sorry, I forgot this is Kyoto. I was meant to read between the lines. It was your way of saying, “Here is your ochatsuke, see you later!” Ami, wait! I’ve found a way you can keep your shop. I made tea. Do you want some? No? Ami, aren't you cold? The heated table is switched on. The kotatsu? Already? Today is kinda cold. don’t you think? Let’s sit under it. Again! You just push and push. It’s never enough. You just want more! I had to push to get anything. All I ever wanted was your respect. Your attention. Isn’t there anything more important to you than your shop? More important? More than my family? My history? Don’t be ridiculous. What about your future? Here. She teaches Japanese harp to tourists. She’s very popular. One of the best rated in Kyoto. She wants to offer kimono experiences too. Do you know what that means? You will have more than enough customers. You won't need to sell to any investors. That’s what you want, right? OK. Then I’ll set up a meeting next week. Thank you. Can I just ask one thing? Why after everything did you cut me off like that? I’ve dealt with angry neighbours before. It didn’t need to be the end. I didn't want that to be the end either. I just needed time to calm down. Then by the time I was ready to talk you had gone away to Tokyo. When the business started to struggle, I was alone again. But, I have pride, you know. The kotatsu is nice... I told you it was warm. Is that Australian art? That one? Yes. It's an Aboriginal dot painting. And my grandma made this one. It's called, "bark painting." That reminds me... I’ve been meaning to ask about your accent. It's different to other Australians I've met. I get that a lot. You have a lot of art. I never thought you would like art. I’m not a collector or anything. I choose things I feel a connection to. Places I've never been. but... how can I explain it...? But which feel like a part of me. Or memories of another time, somewhere I can’t go back to anymore. Complicated... What? Isn’t it romantic? Sometimes you’re a little too romantic... I knew it. You don't like it. I just worry what other people think of you. It wasn’t an issue while I was in Tokyo. How was Tokyo? Tokyo was busy. But in some ways easier than Kyoto. My client needed a place to teach shamisen. In Kyoto, the neighbours complain about the noise. So that kind of place is hard to find. I guess the mindset is different. Kyoto needs a soft touch. Things move slowly. You need to be more patient. You always want everything too quickly. I want you. Why? Because you're the map you're the bridge. Like I said, you're too romantic. Ami, let's go. Go? Where? It’s warm here. I’m sleepy. Can I just stay here for a while? We don't have to go now. But I still want to take you to Uji. It’s been raining so much recently, the boats won’t be able to go out. Still… let’s go. I’ll even shave. OK. What are you thinking about? The river. If you look at the river, you think it’s the same, but it’s changing all the time. What about you? I was thinking, that I’m tired of fighting. That we should leave Kyoto together. Where would we go? Anywhere. And what would we do? Anything. Anything you want. You could do anything. Anywhere. Anything. To be that uncertain. It scares me. It will be OK. Together we can do anything. What do you want to do? That’s why I pray. Praying is fine, but take control! Mum... I don’t know what I should do. We should leave, he said. Can I leave? What do you think I should do? He works hard. He is refreshing… But... Hayato... Why can't you fit in anywhere? Mum, you and dad had an arranged marriage, but you really loved each other. Should I do that? Marry someone like Dad’s coworker? "May I have a healthy baby." Ami Hosokawa "May I have a healthy baby." Ami Hosokawa I could marry him, "May I have a healthy baby." Ami Hosokawa "May I have a healthy baby." Ami Hosokawa I could keep working, "May I have a healthy baby." Ami Hosokawa we could start a family. I can imagine it so clearly… With Hayato... I can’t see anything. I just can't imagine it. Mum. I can’t imagine leaving Dad alone, and starting a brand new life. I just can't. I guess... I'll stay here and continue my life. And Hayato... I will have to say goodbye. Hello? Oh, hello. Yes? Ah! Yeah, I remember you! Are you back in Japan? Wow! Great. Uh huh. Ah, OK. I think I have some time this afternoon. OK. See you soon. Bye. Dad, I'm going out for a bit. How many customers do we have today? We have a lot today. Really? Then I'll be back soon. Oh, no! What's wrong? I wrote the dates all wrong. We have a new emperor now. Be careful! Japanese harp experience Japanese harp experience Good morning! Japanese harp experience Japanese harp experience Good morning! Good morning! Dad, I’m taking a customer out now.
