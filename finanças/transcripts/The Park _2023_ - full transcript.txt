- Hello there, boys and girls. Recently you may have noticed some changes in your bodies. But don't worry, these changes are perfectly normal. What's happening to you is called puberty. It's the process of changing from a child into an adult. - Deaths have been reported in cities around the world. Back to you- - This ain't from nature, people. This is a man-made biological weapon. - The scale of which we have never seen and every adult is at risk. - It appears the disease has no effect on prepubescent children. However, when infected children reach puberty, the effects of the disease will be fatal. - It may seem strange, uncomfortable, even unpleasant at times, but it happens to each and every one of us. - Let us pray for our children, for soon we will be gone and they will have to suffer this plague alone. - We're not gonna make it! Yes we are! Hooah! - Cute backpack. Bring it here. - Come and get it. - Ah, ah. I got this. Look, buddy, there's two ways this can go down. The easy way, or... What am I saying? Nothing is world is fucking easy! - He cut you? - I'm solid. - Tell me he's got water. I'd kill for something with bubbles. Shit, man. What's with you? Think it's funny? Starving to death in the fucking woods? - Shh! Listen. You hear that? - Where are we? This place ain't on the map. We should skip it. We gotta find that genius. - Wait. They've got water. But they're packing heat. Heavy. - Water? They got a whole ocean! ♪ You never want to hurt the one who loves you ♪ So. What's our move here? - It's my move. You're staying on recon. - Boring! - Lay low and suss out the area. This is just a pit stop. - Wait. You're leaving me here? Alone? In Blue Meanie territory? I heard they found geezers around here. Wrapped in blue plastic. Throats cut open. Like pigs. - Don't be a pussy. I'll back with a tasty treat just for you. Don't lose that. Scared of a ghost story. - I ain't scared! It ain't no story. - Mm-hmm. - Halt! Who's there? - Water! Please. Meet me in three. By the jazz swingers. - Jazz swingers? Thank you. It's been rough out there. I'm headed north. Town called Derby. Heard of it? They say there's like some kid genius who made a vaccine or something. It's probably just a rumor, but I'm still gonna go look... - Are you alone? You sure? I hate surprises. - Yes. - I'm just playing. I love surprises. You're coming from the city, right? I heard kids over there be going, like, crazy, like full-on Mad Max and whatnot. My mom was from there. Where are you from? - I'm from- - Oh! Guess what I'm working on? Bet you money you can't guess. Not that money matters anymore. I'm sorry, I just get really excited when I meet new people. Oh, speaking of surprises, I need to show you something. My project, Al-Shifa. You're gonna bug out. It's literally gonna change the world. Can you walk on that? - Sorta. - Great. Here, let me get that for you. - Hands up and don't move. All of your shit? It's mine now. So be a doll and gather it up for me and I'll be on my merry way. - Whose blood is that? - The last fucker who didn't do as they were told. Hold still! One more step and I toast you. I'm for real, this aint a game. - Sure it is. - Kids these days. - Wow! You were really gonna ice me just like that. You cold-blooded. Tell you what. Apologize and maybe I'll still show you my project. - Back the fuck off! Hey, Bui! - Okay, you know what? Now you're starting to piss me off. - Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Please. No. No more shots. No! Stop! Don't! I'm not sick anymore! Get off of me! Stop! Stop! Stop! Ow! - Idiot! Hold still! - Kid. Kid! - My name is Kuan. And I bet we're, like, the same age. Okay. This is going to hurt, but you're a dingus. And you sorta deserve it. - Ow! - I ain't scared. ♪ Oh, I wish I had someone to love me ♪ ♪ Someone to call me their own ♪ ♪ Oh, I wish I had someone to live with ♪ - What is this? - Dinner. - This smells like actual garbage. Wait! Sorry. ♪ Oh, please meet me tonight in the moonlight ♪ ♪ Please meet me tonight all alone ♪ - Aw, jackpot. These are mine, girl. - Ines. - What? - Ines. That's my name, it's French. It's clear tonight. - Dormir a la belle etoile. That's French for "to sleep under-" - Je sais. Tu parles francais? - Oh. Uh, no. Not really. My mom taught me. She knew, like, 20 languages. Wanted to learn 'em all. Even at the very end. You should've seen her in her hospital bed with like all of her phrasebooks stacked up around her. Counting to 10 in Indonesian. Satu. Dua. Tiga. - Kuan, why are you helping me? - The way I see it is that we're helping each other. My project, it's... It's like a football game. I need a team. I can't do it alone. Unless I threw the ball really high to myself. Or made little cardboard team cutout people and- - What project? - You ever heard of Al-Shifa? It's this ancient Persian book. It means "The Healing." Now, I'm not religious, really, but they say that if you can recite all of Al-Shifa to a sick man, he will be cured like that. So that's what I'm building. That's my project. Hold this. - You're making a cure? - Yep. - I knew it! You're the kid genius! You're the one I've been looking for! - You can't cure the virus. That's literally impossible. My cure is for something else. - Wait, then you're not- - Watch this. I am a golden god... Or not. Dang it. - Wait, so what are you curing then? - Well, it's like... Did you believe in Santa Claus when you were younger? - Of course. - Right, so when you're a kid, you believe in the impossible. But then you grow up and the world teaches you that it's not true. You stop believing. But what if the world is wrong? - The fuck are you talking about? Have you see the world today? The twisted shit these kids are doing to each other? It's a sickness! We're all sick, inside and out. I'm sorry, but you're weird and I'm confused and this all just seems like a huge waste of time! Which, if you hadn't noticed, that is in short supply these days! And I want... I, I... - What do you want? - I... I... Bui, don't! - Big mistake! You guys are dead! - She hurt you? - We gotta take her out. What the fuck? Bui! Shit! - Faster. You know, I had a, like, perfect plan before you and your butthole friend came and mucked everything up. Now I'm not so sure. I mean, maybe you're right. Maybe I got this world all wrong. I mean, shit, we're gonna die anyway, right? Why waste time? Why not kill each other? Move. What do you see? - A moldy old slide. Wrong. You're only what's right in front of you. You have an imagination, don't you, dummy? So use it. See what this place could be. What we could share with everyone that's left. Look. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! Can we do that again? - Yeah! - As we go through puberty, we start to notice changes in our bodies. Our voices start to sound different. See, there's an organ in your throat called the larynx, or voice box. During puberty your larynx grows thicker and larger. Boys will notice their voice becoming deeper. Girls will too, but only a little. So buckle up because puberty is taking you on the bumpy road to adulthood. - Relax, Scarface. The first kill is always the hardest. It'll get much easier with a little more practice. And cheer up. You're this week's champion! You just made my new squad. Here's your uniform. Scarface, don't go crybaby on me now. You wanna be part of my squad, you better man up. - Hey! Get over here! Hurry up! Faster! - Fucking bitch. - Where did you learn to do that? You're a freaking fish ninja. - YouTube. - You see what I'm seeing, right? - Hell yes. A little salt, some chili oil, and we got us a tasty... - Hands off Carpe Diem! Have a little vision. This is only the beginning. We get your gigantic friend to help us, we stock this place full of specimens, make sure the rides and slides are spic and span and up and running, and boom! We are the proud owners of the best theme park slash aquatic entertainment center in the world. - Best and only. Huh! Fuck me. So why carry a fake gun when you got the real thing? - Never let the enemy know the true power of your forces. Art of War. Sunny Zoo wrote that. - It's Sun Tzu, not Sunny Zoo. And he never said that. - It was Tom Cruise then. Say, what do you think happened to the zoos? Do you think all the animals ate each other? Or did some of them escape and start toasting people? What would you rather fight? A lion or a Blue Meanie? - A Blue Meanie. 'Cause they aren't real. - They are too real. We're on the same team now, right? And you're going to put your genius hunt on hold and help me with Al-Shifa. Don't lie! I can see if you're lying. - Bullshit you can. - Wait! Wow. You just, like, saved my life. - This guy's not poisonous. - Are too real! - Dude! The Blue Meanies were made up by some kingpin to freak his squad out and keep 'em in line. Trust me, it's what I do. Only I'd come up with a better name. - You ain't got no squad. - I used to. - What happened to 'em? - What do you think? They were two grades ahead. They went geezer a while back. Bui and I are all that's left. - Oh. I'm sorry. - Don't be. No one's gonna miss those pricks. - I wish I had a squad. All I got is stupid Luka. - Who? - Luka, my brother. He's a real pain in my ass. I mean, he was supposed to re-up on water from the river. I'm sure he's out there somewhere just, like, playing with little cars or something. I mean, this kid... Earth to Ines! - Sorry. What was... - I said did you happen to see Luka on your way in? - Sorry. - What a little fuckin' pussy. - Easy, tiger. - Took you long enough. - If you played nice with her for like two seconds, she'd let you go. - When do we play nice? Don't get it, man. Shit here's all backwards. Shit! - Chill! She won't see us. - Ugh. She's crazy and tone-deaf. Yo, we're wasting time here. We gotta get moving and find that genius already. You wanna go full geezer in this shithole or what? - So just lie to her. Say you're sorry. - I ain't like you. I ain't a liar. - You're a pain in my ass is what you are. - Wait. - I got the wrong key. - Since day one I've done like you've always said. I might not be clever like you, but I can see what's in front of my face. And I'm telling you, that girl, she ain't us. - Bui. Let me go! - She fucking stabbed me! What are you all standing around for? Do something! One of you get her! I'm your goddamn leader! Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! - The king is dead. Long live the motherfucking queen! From now on you do what I say, when I say it, or you get toasted. We crystal on that? Lovely. First things first: no more of this. We shouldn't be fighting each other. This aint' fuckin' "Hunger Games." We stick together and we keep the system nice and binary. There are two kinds of people. There's us and there's them. And if you ain't us, well, then tough titty. What do you say? Bui? Us? Or them? Wait! I... I give up! You win! Stop, please! This is your last chance. Concentrate. Make it count. Ho-ho-ho! C'est dommage. So close. Hey! You only get three tries! You know, cheaters only cheat themselves. Silly girl. Aw, snap. It's chow time. - We are not eating that garbage-ass stew ever again. - Wow.

Like your mom. - You were sick too? - Mm-hmm. - So tell me about it. - Uh, I don't now. I spent a lot of time in the hospital. There was no one to talk to. I was bored as shit. - Where were your parents? - I never met them. So I read. A lot. My favorites were the stories with disasters and monsters where everyone dies at the end. I started imagining what I'd do if that ever happened to me. And then I started, like, researching what to do. And the more I read, the more I started to believe it was all real. And it sounds nuts, but it was almost like I was waiting for the end of the world. So that when it finally came, I was ready. Although I was hoping there would be some zombies. - There's Blue Meanies. - Shut up and pull it. - Aw, man, that's it? It looks terrible! I spend like so long working on... You did it! Magnifique!

Like, why you gotta be so nice to her and such a dickhole to me? Is it 'cause I know the real you and not this fake-ass character you're playing? Is that it? It's like, what if she knew you toasted her little friend? Would you still be all BFF then? Huh? - For two years I've kept your dead-weight bitch-ass alive! Remind me why I bother. - I wasn't gonna tell her nothing! I swear! Ines! Ines, wait! Shit! - He's gone. Isn't he? - Kuan, I gotta tell you something- - You know, every time this happens, it gets... Easier to say goodbye and... Just like that, you start to forget. I don't want to be forgotten. I don't want this place to just disappear. I want us, all of us, to build it, together. To remind everyone that's left what this world could be. What it should be. And I believe in that. In this place. It can save us. I'm not crazy for thinking that, am I? - Oh, you're definitely crazy. But you're right about this place. It's... It's really special. What? - You have, like, some paint on your face. - Ow! Be gentle. - Ines! It's time for us to go. Right now. - Bui- - Me or her! Who's it gonna be? - Big guy, you need to take a chill pill. - Move. - Bui, no! - Oh, you're dead! - Guys! Stop! Ow! - You okay? - Ow! - This was Luka's. You! No. It was you. Yeah. Of course it was. - Kuan, please. I didn't know. - Should've seen it right away. But I saw something in you. You were different. You were good! I'm so fucking stupid! Now you have 10 seconds to get out of here before I'm back with a bullet for each of you. You killers. You fucks! You don't belong here! You'll never be cured. And you'll die. And you'll rot. And you'll be forgotten. - Kuan! Kuan! Kuan! Kuan! No, Kuan! No, Kuan! Please! - Shit! Shit. Come on, we gotta go! Come on! We gotta get those gats. Where's that cabinet? Come on! - But the Blue Meanies, they're not real! Bui! Bui. Stop. - Gotta keep... - Dammit, let me down! - Ines, we gotta... We gotta keep going. - There's no we. And there never was. There's you and there's me. So go. Keep off the trails and you can make it. - Ines. Fuck you. They're close. Shit. Come on, you gotta eat something. Shit. - Put me down. - Ines- - I need to see this! - Okay! Chill. - His throat. Looks like it's smiling. - Come on. Creep. Good news. 10 miles. Derby's up the road. If we hustle tomorrow we can find your genius. - There's no genius. No cure. She was the only one who understood that. And even still, she built all of that... Al-Shifa. What a useless thing to do.

But I have been here for, like, an eternity, which is a lot of time to think about things. - What kind of things? - Ines things. Your whole deal. Your purpose, why you exist, you know. All the basic stuff. - I've done terrible things. Made so many mistakes. I don't know what I'm doing. Or if I ever did. - What you should do is throw the friggin' plane. You may not see it yet, but you're on a path. A road you've been walking down your whole life. And it's bumpy and it's rough and sometimes you get a little rock in your shoe and then you get a blister and then the blister just keeps bursting, it's the worst, then you wonder, "Is this the wrong shoe for this?" But you gotta keep walking the path and leading the others down it with you. 'Cause that's what girls like you do. Everything we do in this life, the good, the bad, the help and the hurt, it all gets added up. And in the end, I'll bet top dollar that you'll have a big ol', giant, 10-story stack of good in your hands. You just gotta keep on. - Kuan? I... I'm... - I know, girl. Me too. - Hey! The bag. Toss it over here. You got a death wish, bitch? Yeah. That's what I thought. Aw, fuck! Let me go! Oh shit, you're one of them! Please don't kill me! I have money!
