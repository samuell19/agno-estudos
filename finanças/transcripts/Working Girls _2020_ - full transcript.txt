Ryan, please, shut the hell up. Ryan, shoes on now. - Ryan... Belt up, Grannie. Watch your tone! And you, put that cigarette out. My morning ciggie won't kill your babies. - Open up now. Open the door! No! - That's enough! Open it now! No use, I need a cross-head one. - Axelle... Hold on. Your bills! - Not now. Now, Axelle. Right, let's see... Excess electricity... Water bill... Bill from the lawyer... I have to do the shopping and Keylis needs new shoes. I'm not made of money. Why? Because his feet have grown. Have your feet grown? - No. And I need new shoes too. Your feet have grown too? It's so hot, I can't walk properly. My feet swell up. - Soak them in cold water or swim. Think I enjoy begging? Axelle! Do you think I enjoy begging? I have my dignity too! I'm sick of it! Take that off. No. You look like Grannie! Never mind. I do mind. Take it off. No. Charline. Take off the makeup. No. I wanna dress up! - Let's go now. I wanna dress up! - Come on, let's go. A kiss! Good morning. Yes, a kiss, honey. How's it going? See you later. Check her out... She's yours. Hey, miss, I need comforting. Can you blow me? Just 5 minutes. I'm busy. Try asking your mum. What's that about my mum? No respect. Hey, miss! Not even 5 minutes, 2 will do. A fast shooter... - I'm talking to you! 5 minutes... C'mon! Hi. - How's it going? Can you drive? Sure. C'mon, just 5 minutes! Don't get shy now. Asked your dad? - What? Fucking bitch. He taught me to suck cock. He's the best around here. Don't insult my dad! Chill! - Sure. Ball-buster. He's the worst. Know what I heard? He takes girls' cherries, films them and puts them nude online. Scum like him make girls whores. That's not true. It's all lies. - What? Even that young they can be bastards. They're just kids. Your son's a kid? Yeah. Know what? I swear, before my daughter Charline turns 12, we'll split. She won't be hamburger. Heard stuff about my daughter? What? You say my son's a pimp and my daughter's hamburger? No. - You heard stuff about them? No, Do. No. - So why say that? Cos I'm talking about that. All right, listen carefully. My daughter isn't hamburger and never will be! I never said that! - You implied it! I didn't! That shit treats girls like hamburger. Your daughter isn't hamburger. I'm not hamburger, you neither. We're not hamburger, ok! Hey , jungle bunny! Look at her. She's asking to get fucked in a basement. Jesus... You have to show your panties? It's summer. You look like a slut. BELGIUM The white one's Isko and that's Luka. And this is Athéna. Off you go now, come on. Do, find an outfit for the new girl. What's her name? That's Scheherazade. Scheherazade? Isn't that a Greek god? No, dear, The Arabian Nights. Come on, girls. Butts and boobs nice and perky. Thanks. At our place, every moment is a holiday Dibs for me. What a kid. Hey, look... Your breasts are gorgeous. Come on. Come on. Let me see. What happened? Keylis, what happened? Tell me. What happened? Nothing. Hello, ma'am. Excuse me a second. Ferhat, play someplace else, please. Thank you. As I told your husband... First, he's not my husband. Must you? - He's not my husband. Ok. What I have to say is what I told... We can't keep him. Keylis? But why? He broke one kid's arm and another's nose. Almost. - Want a smashed nose and arm too? Calm down! Are you nuts? You shouldn't even be here. - He's my son. I mean it. Not your son, ours. And I have custody. Our son in your custody shouts "Allah Akbar" and beheads pals. It's odd, but they all do it. I don't understand. - Me neither. What do you mean, they all do it? Me neither. Why shout "Allah Akbar"? You're not Muslim. Is this a joke? What the hell is this? He's not Muslim and I'm trying to understand. Your son is violent. - That's absurd. So, as a Muslim, he could stay here? Not even then. It's anti-white racism. I said something racist? My wife's cranky... - I'm not your wife. Where's the headmistress? I'm the headmistress. Know what? We're leaving. I'll call you. Leave him here. - Hands off! Come on. Axelle, I screwed up, but you did too. We're still married. You're my wife. Mum... You've no right to know we live here. You can't come here. - Can we talk? No? - Call my lawyer. Go and play. - Know how hard that is? Haven't you punished me? - Not too high. I need to know if you're with someone. It's tough, but it's clear. Cut it out. Come back and I'll call the cops. You won't. - I will. You don't scare me. - I swear. Let's go. - I love you, Axelle. I love you, I love you.... Can we go? Come on. Ryan, let's go. - Behave with Mum, you monkey. Ryan! Ryan, come here. See the state they're in? They're suffering. Do you see that? You don't give a shit, huh? You're the only one who matters. Selfish bitch. Come on, let's go. - Selfish bitch. Bye, guys! - Bye, Dad! Let's go! I'm hungry. It's here. How many is that? Five. You're sure? - Five. No, I don't think so. I'd say... Six or so. Or seven. Maybe seven, yes. Got someone? I love you. I didn't wanna be beheaded. I know that. I know. Luka, in the living room! Come on, girls, get to work! You've got a client. Which one? - No idea. Athéna? Why are you here? I came to see my wife. You wash between clients? You followed me? Yes, I did. And? You'll call the cops now? Will you? You'll call them? "My husband's the only guy who can't touch me." Is that it? I'm a monster? You want everyone to believe that? The cops, the judge, my children? My own kids! Who'll they believe now? - Calm down. Who'll they believe? The monster or the whore? Who'll get custody of the kids now? Too bad it's not another guy. I could've beaten him up. But who do I take revenge on now? You're trembling, my love. You're trembling. Calm down. Gently... Let me hold you, my love. Gently. Gently... We can have secrets too. Like before. It smells good. What's for dinner? What's for dinner? I've made spaghetti Bolognese. My favourite dish. My favourite! Have you had a good day? Yes. You're not asking about mine? Did you have a good day? - Slowly... Did you have a good day, baby? Undress me. - Yes. Of course. You've missed me? Lots and lots. Hold on. What are you doing? I said, like before. Ok. - Like before. Ok. I want you to moan like before. Let me hear you moan. This bitch took a real pounding! So, baby, did he really give it to you? Really good? You moaned, huh? Show me how you moan, Athéna. Yeah... I bet he... Shut your mouth! Shut your fucking mouth! There, that's good. - Let go of her! Like that! There, like that! Axelle! Calm down. Like that! There you go! What have you done? Ryan's broken the TV. - No, you all did it! You don't want to talk? What about? I'll call her. Where're you going? - I'll fetch her. Wait, I'll call her. Conso! Conso! Girl! You like that, baby? Yes, I love it, baby. Come on... Hold on... Go on. I'm close... Oh, Jesus... - That's good. You're hot. I love you. I love you... I love you... I love you too. Is that true? - Yes. Really true? - Yes. What's wrong? What's up? I'm taking a shower. Come on... Where do you go next? I'll take you to dinner, baby! There. Have you seen? There's a tiny diamond. You thought I'd forget my panther's birthday? Thank you! Shall we go? Shit... I want you. Take that off. Take it off. I'm gonna fuck you. Come here. - No. Come back here. Come here! You won't get away. I'm gonna fuck you! Come here! Hey, jungle bunny! How's it going, jungle bunny? Wanna play with my coconuts? Look at me! Come on! What's the problem? Jesus... You have to show your panties? It's summer. You look like a slut. Good morning! Will you ever be on time? The day your kids stop waking me at 6 am. Try sleeping at night. Are you trying to control my life? Do, her kids are hell, they yell all the time. It's unbearable. We'll see how your kids turn out. Honey, my kids will be good-looking and intelligent like their dad. He's so handsome! Watch the road. - Tell her to stop! The day you fall off that blond wimp's cloud, your ass will hurt so bad... She's jealous. Know why? Cos I have love. What does she have? Three kids, a wasted mum, a shit life. Sure you're not a blonde? There's no blonde blood in your past? A stray Viking who fucked things up? Won't you miss the blonde just a bit when she leaves? I bet you will. Honestly? I'll forget you in no time. - You'll pine for me. No time. - Love you too, bitch. It's my test, give it here! Give it here! Bitch! - She's raping me! Come on, calm down! Shit, negative. It's better for the world, Conso. The silly cow's disappointed! I'm not disappointed. Your period was two weeks ago. It's waste of money. - I was ovulating. I don't get it. It takes a few days for a fertilized ovum to travel up the fallopian tube to the womb. The way you talk! Weird... Want to examine me or what? You pains... Shit... - You didn't use protection? Sure I did, but the condom tore. No morning-after pill? - When? Forget it, you don't understand. When was it? - No more questions. Stop, ok. Luka, come here! You were in there ages. Had your shower? I have cream if you want. With these showers, your skin... That hurt. - Watch what you say, ok. Here. I don't drink. Just a sip. No, sweetie. Can I have some? - Me too, Mum. Get some glasses. Get me one. - Come here, Luka! At first... At first, the muscles hurt more than your slit. We whores are athletes. You know why? With her elephant-like pussy, she wouldn't even feel a mammoth. Have you ever seen a mammoth dick? I've seen you wanking mammoths, like this. Here come the mammoths. Shit... Come on, girls, aperitif time. Four of them. Nothing but champagne, ok? It's their first time here. Any blonds? - Who cares, they reek of money. Let's go. Hurry it up. Ms Ndiaye, at a certain age, without any diplomas, no references and when you're black as you are, you can't expect it all. You won't get it. You take what comes... - And clean people's shit. There's no shame in being a cleaning lady. Don't waste your breath. My mum cleaned for 35 years. What the hell do you know? You're dead in your mind with your pension. I have dreams, ok, and a life ahead of me. No! When an episode begins, the bell rings. Every time. You're not here to watch TV. Up you get. Circe... Lola, Hera, Scheherazade... There. I'm looking for a blonde that a pal recommended. The girls change according to the day and we have several blondes. She's not tall. Did your friend say if she was French, Romanian... No, French, with blue eyes and a dimple when she smiles. Athéna. She's in a room right now. She'll be half an hour. Longer if the gent wants more. Do we wait or try another girl to recommend to your friends? I'll wait. We could have a drink. Two pass time quicker. Three as well. The black then. Circe! Thank you, girls. What'll you have, sir? Champagne. A small bottle is 130, a normal one 200 and a magnum 500. A magnum's good in this heat. A normal one. Pity. With the magnum, I can pour champagne between my breasts. Here you are. There you go. The glasses, dear. All services are paid in advance here. It's 100 for half an hour, 130 for three quarters, 160 for a full hour. Card or cash. Extras are paid in the room, in cash. 30 for condom-free fellatio, 50 for sodomy, 50 for facial ejaculation... What does she do? Who? Athéna or this girl? No, Athéna. The lot. She loves sex. I love to lick her sweet pussy. Loyalty card? On the sixth visit, you get free fellatio. You're a real bitch. You're a whore and a bitch. Honey, that's how a pro works. When you go... Only a fag gets hard. I don't do it that way. - You do, that same way. No, she highlights her female attributes. Exactly. You scare them. You go like this... Like this. At least I'm honest. They take me as I am. The guy doesn't care who you are. All he wants is... Oh, yes... Slip it in. You're so hard... Yes, come on... Fuck me... God, yes... Mum... Yes... Harder... Harder... Yes... Yes, that's it, cum now! Yes, I'm cumming! Come on! Bravo, Mum! They love that. You do it so well. - The moaning is... like a guitar, see. You get in tune with... The tuner. - Yes, that's it. It's gradual. - You tune his guitar. He loses you, gets you back... Go on. So how was it? Bitch, you took a pounding! Athéna, show me how you moan. I love cowboy boots. Shut your mouth! - Axelle! Shut your fucking mouth, ok! Stop it! Like that! There, like that! What a kid. Sorry, I got the wrong room. My panther... I'm so happy. It's you I want tonight, you I want. Come on. Give me that... Gentlemen, she's here among us. For you, for us, for tonight... Straight from Africa... My panther! Isn't she beautiful? - Delighted... Don't be shy. Look at those legs. Look at her! Such long, slender legs. And that ass! Open your mouth. Come on, don't be afraid. Perfect teeth, not one filling. Her hands... Those slender fingers tickling your prostate. What's that? No! No taboos tonight! Men cum via the ass! Jean-Fi! Jean-Fi, what's going on? - What? Ok, come on, I'll show you. Look. This is my son. My son! Born a couple of hours ago. He was out before my wife could call. I'm so happy. Your wife's pregnant? - What? You wife's pregnant? - No, not anymore, he's out. Isn't he beautiful? My son's a winner like me. Guys, he's a winner! My kid's the best! Got the drugs? She's got the drugs! She's the best! I love you, baby, I love you. Come on, beauty, please. For pity's sake, wake up. Forgive me. Forgive me. Come on, wake up, please. Hold on. Hello, Do? I can't fucking wake Conso! Yes. I don't know. There's coke and pills here. I don't know. I don't know. Come on, Conso, wake up. Ok, just a second... That's turning me on. I like that. I love it. I love it. That's good. That's so good. Your little feet fondling my sex... That feels so good. It turns me on. I almost feel I could get hard again. Do you miss it? Yes. I miss my wife. I think she'd have missed it too... That thing. Life is just perfect. I know your little feet, I know your mouth, I know your eyes. I know you hate Piaf. That you're allergic to cat hair. And that you have... a beauty spot here, midway between your shoulder and your right hip. Here. Right? We'd have made a fine couple. Can you help me to climb out? Dominique... Doing ok, bitches? How are you doing? - I'm fine. You're fine? Don't ever try that again! I'm sorry. He went and had a baby, Mum. With his wife. He lied to me. Domi? You know each other? Yes. She babysits my kids. You must be a great babysitter. You're coming with me now to sign the forms before going home. Have a nice bath, eat a good meal... What do you like? When I was in Senegal, I ate that white ball-shaped thing... What's it called? Jesus... Domi, keep an eye on her for the next 24 hours. And she shouldn't do any babysitting for now. All right... Your turn, you're her neighbour. You're her nurse. - No. My shift's in two hours. - My mum hates blacks. She won't last 5 minutes with Conso. It'll end in murder. Conso won't survive, believe me. This guy's a real jerk. Give it here. Tomorrow 6 pm? - He won't give up. Look after her tonight. - Erase it. Yes, I'll erase it. Find out where they're due to meet. That's it, all set. Who's taking her? I am. Have a good day. - We tossed for it. My mum's waiting for you. She's done a nice Senegalese dish. Come on, let's go. I'll add a little morphine. Already up? I felt hot. I needed a shower. You shave there? Yeah, like my mum, I prefer a hairless pussy. What can I say? Sorry. Hi, it's Zoé. Leave a message and maybe I'll call you. Do, are you ok? And you? Yes. This is it. Hold on. Good evening. What is it? Conso got held up. I'm the replacement candy. Hold on... Zoé... What? But why? Ok. Right now, I'm in a waiting room. At the doctor's. Because... Listen, I can't... Where are you? Come back! - I want us to talk later, ok? Come here. Come here, I said, come on. Please. Here I come. That's so good. Feel my butt? Yeah, I feel it. What a great ass. A real slutty ass. What an ass! Holy fuck! - Hey, gently, ok. Ok. May I? Go ahead. Calm down now, calm down... Oh, the pussy-pounding I'll give you! You'll have such a good time you'll want to pay me. You won't be able to walk, slut. That's cold! What is it? - Do you like it? My pussy juice. It's my pussy juice. - Shit... Hot bitch. Smell this. You get me wet like this. Like it? - Yes! I know you like it, you little pig. You're such a naughty boy. Want me to spank you? - Yeah, go on. Give me a good spanking. Suck my cock. Suck my fucking cock! Yes. Here I come. Here I come... I'm gonna blow you so well... I'm gonna blow you so well... What the fuck was that? What's going on? Shut your mouth. Shit, I'm gonna fuck you! Fuck you like a bitch! Look. Look over there. What is this? Untie me right now. Come on, untie me! What the hell is this? Untie me! Fuck! Got it? Stay calm now. Ok, got my ass in the photo? No photos! Cut it out, no photos! Cut it out! Try to move up higher. I haven't got it. Get up there near his shoulder. Your ass isn't in it. It has to be near his shoulder. - What is this? Shut your damn mouth. That's it. Try sitting down on him. - What's going on? Listen to me! Shut your mouth or you're gonna get it! Juice, Do? - No, thanks. The call-out fee... And this is for the gear. Athéna... For my trick. Ok? Special rate. Please, untie me. Hush, don't move. Keep still for the focus. Ok, to sum up... Jean-Philippe Chappelle... If you try just once to see Conso again or even try to contact her, I'll email the photos to your wife. And post them on Facebook. And email them to your boss. And to every local crčche. I haven't finished. But if you don't try to see her, you'll never hear from us again. Deal? All right. I've deleted her number. Let's go. The maid will love this. Personally, I loved it. Filthy whores! Fucking filthy whores! Bitches! - Let him yell, Do. Sluts! Filthy whores! It's ok, we're done. - Hold on. Whores, yes. Whores. But filthy whores? - No, I'm sorry. What? Not filthy whores. - Promise. Say it. Not filthy whores. - There. It's beautiful. Really beautiful. You smoke? Now and then. It doesn't suit you. - Too bad. I need it now. Ever killed someone? In my dreams, yes. I need a new phone. I broke mine. I need a new phone! Try asking nicely. I did. - No way. I asked you nice and calm. Call that calm? - Yeah, I'm calm! You are? - Fuck! It's easy to get a fucking phone from a fucking store! She's not some machine, ok! Hey! - Fuck... Arthur... I'll waste you one day. - You spat at him? He started it. - So you spit at him? You always defend him. You spit at people? If you prefer him, why did you have me? I hate you all! You're dressed like a slut! Shut the hell up! Hi there. How's it going? You look beautiful. Hello. Hello! What's he doing here? - Arthur! How old are you? 18, almost 19. Do you use protection for sex? You make love, right? You know what I mean by love? How's it going? - Good, and you? I'm going, Mum. Could you... Will this do? - Fantastic. Love you. - Good night. Do you know what's going on? She's in love. She split up with her boyfriend and she's sad. She can't say she has a boyfriend, that they split up and that she's sad. It gets to be too much. How do you know that? We talk. Suck my cock... Your erotic dream is over. How is she? Ok. The asshole hasn't called, so she's ok. Hiya! Are you ok? I hate them all. Welcome to the world. They make me puke. No more men for me. Let's go. I'll drive. No man, no pussy. I'll be a nun and atone for my sins. Maybe not a lot, just something tiny. People make me sick. But sex doesn't. Do, what's the sickest thing a client asked you? Something really... disgusting. Nothing disgusts Do. Come on... - Nothing disgusts her. Do will be reincarnated as Mother Teresa. Girl, Mother Teresa's dead. I know. You can't be reincarnated as a dead person. Not a dead person, Mother Teresa. She's someone... Immortal. - Yeah. You're far out. Too far out for me! You're too religious for me. Cut it out. Mother Teresa will be reincarnated as me. Same difference. No. - It's the same. If you like. - Ok, never mind. I remember once a guy asked for role-play. He said, "We're friends, ok, you turn me on, and, at one point in the conversation, I say I have a 20 cm cock." Why is it always 20 cm? It's like it's a standard. You said it. - Wouldn't 19.5 be more credible? So we bet on the size. The guy said, "If I lose, you sodomize me and vice versa." Small cock, I say. Sodomy... - Of course. A tiny cock. There was shit all over the dildo... And the smell... - Disgusting. I opened the window, gave him wipes and wrapped it up. I'd had to make him eat his cum. Do we need to hear this? I told him, "Stand up and wank." He did. He collected it in his hand. A big load. And swallowed it. And then he gave a big... I don't get it. She's a blonde. What's so hardcore about that? What? - The cum-eating? No, that's fine. I've made loads of guys eat cum. It's horrible. Usually, the guy unloads on the bed, you grab his head and make him lick it up. They act disgusted, but this one collected it in his hand... and swallowed it. You're mad. I'm not. Why? - You are... Don't say that. - She's mad. She's not mad, the guy is. She just did her job. Oh, yeah, right. Shit... Go on, run. Zoé! Are you all right? - Yes. Yes, I'm ok. What's the matter? What's wrong? The machinery's a bit rusty. You know... What are you doing, Dom? Let me use a finger. I won't hurt you. My little finger. Let me use the little one. - Cut it out... You want to talk to me? What about you? No. - You don't? No. Know the way? - Yes. Get comfortable. I'll be right back. Come on. Faster. - Sorry, mistress. Do, I'm going. Me too. See you tomorrow, bitch. Why is he here? He says he's taking your kids. And he's been drinking. What have you done now? Put the kids to bed. I'm not your maid. Zoé... Where were you last night? And you? - Answer me. Answer me. Making pocket money. Are you crazy? You're nuts! Dad! What's this in your hair? What's this? What is it? You wear extensions now? She wears extensions. So what? I don't care what you think! - Shut up! You don't give a shit. Well, we don't give a shit about you! Do you know who we are? Do you? You don't know me and I don't know you! What do you care who I am? - Who are you? I don't know who you are but I love you anyway! It doesn't stop me loving you! Mum, please. - I don't know you! Don't "Mum" me! You want money? - Cut it out. Calm down. Here, my big darling. Here you go! Money for you! You too! Loads of money! You want some too? You as well? I made it. Take it. I make it for you! Want to know who I am? You really want to know? I want you, Axelle. - No. Hold on, hold on. No. Calm down. How much? Calm down. How much do you want? Listen to me. Calm down. Calm down. The kids are here... I'll fuck you on the table like a bitch and you'll love it. The kids... Yann... Suck my cock. You're a whore, Axelle, suck it. You're hurting me. Suck my cock... Let go of me. Let go of me, ok? You hurt me. Why did you hurt me? Stop! Your daughter's a whore. Mummy? I'll go. Go back to sleep. Do, it's Axelle, call me. I need you to come over. I need you. Come on. But why? What's... - Come on, please. Hold on, Axelle. He's her ex-husband. Will they take my kids? They'll take my kids. I told you, they'll take my kids. Stop it. No... Do, what do we do? It's hopeless. Do? - Hold on. It's hopeless... I'd rather jump out of the window than lose my kids, I swear. I'd rather jump out of the window. Do, what do we do? I'd rather jump. I'd rather jump out of the window, Mum, than lose my damn kids. I don't give a shit. Yeah, go for it! Go on. He's finally here. Is that your mixer? - Yeah, from the next site.
