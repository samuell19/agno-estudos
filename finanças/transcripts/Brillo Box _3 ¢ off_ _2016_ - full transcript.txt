"1964, Andy Warhol shocked the art world" "by making hundreds of replicas of supermarket cartons" "and presenting them as art" "His most notorious were the Brillo boxes" "That same year, my parents got engaged, they married" "began collecting art and brought this yellow Brillo box" Some thought I was crazy "How could you call that art?" But that was part of the fun of it when people would react that way It was the fact it was so out of context "And it was the new form of art" I loved it I absolutely loved it "But soon after, my father traded our Brillo box" "for a work by another artist" "The Brillo box left our living room and went on a journey of it's own" "800 hundred dollars" "2 million dollars" "2 million and 100 hundred" 2 million and 100 hundred dollars 2 million and 200 hundred dollars "40 years later the same yellow Brillo box" "that my parents acquired for one thousand dollars" "went on to sell for over three million" "This is the story of our Brillo box" "So question number one is what?" "The question number one is how you got into collecting" First weekend after you were born and Mom was in the hospital "I had time on my hands on a Saturday" "And a good friend of mine" "who was a budding art collector took me on a gallery round" We were very young And we were sort of growing into things "I had just begun as an assistant DA" "there wasn't a lot of money to spare" "Paintings were going in the hundreds then" "The first piece that we wound up with" "was an abstract piece by Jake Berthot" "My father looked at the picture on the wall" He wondered if the picture was out being cleaned I had to explain to him that this was abstract expressionism and what he was looking at was the picture You try new things and if it's not accepted it becomes a little... conversational "Abstract expressionism and pop art" "were competing with one another" "I looked at both kinds of art" and like a person who knew nothing about any kind of art We were drawn to what was new and what was also, at that time affordable "But basically, I think my naivety about the whole scene was helpful" because I could only buy what I liked and that's what you should do "Tell me what you knew about Warhol in 1969?" "He was a new up and coming artist" that was working on the fringe A new type of art that wasn't considered art "What is pop art anyway and how would you define it?" "A good friend of mine introduced me to Ivan Karp" "who used to be the gallery director at the Castelli gallery" "until he opened OK Harris" "Ivan Karp was so important in the art world" "His relationship with his artists and his customers, you all felt together" "And he had a great understanding of the artists" "who were struggling for recognition" "and struggling to make a career out of his work" "It was at Ivan Karp's gallery Ok Harris" "that my father first encountered the Brillo box" "The next piece that we acquired was a Brillo box" "When I first saw it at Mr. Karp's gallery" "it was an absolute replica" "of a carton that might have gone to some deli" "And it was the smaller version of the Brillo boxes" "Now the big white Brillo box was a lot more expensive" "than the yellow" "And the yellow wasn't considered as desirable as the white" but there certainly were less of them "There was something about the three cents off" It was almost cute I mean, as one person said "You want to pick it up and just take it home" You could just sort of hug it "It just had this wonderful kind of quality to it" that was different than the other boxes I think mainly because of its scale "The yellow Brillo box my father bought" "was one of the first of the supermarket cartons" "that Andy Warhol made" "Warhol and his assistants flattened out" "the original cardboard boxes" "made silkscreens" "then printed the familiar graphics" "of Heinz, Del Monte, Kellogg's Campbell's and Brillo" "on wooden boxes in a virtual assembly line" "Warhol's East 47th street headquarters" "soon became known as the factory" "And the factory became the place to be" If there wasn't a Warhol I wouldn't have bought anybody's Brillo box "How many artists do you know" "that could take stuff that you could buy off a shelf in a supermarket" and turn it into a work of art that could be sold to the public? And make a lot of money on it He was a genius Appropriation is a term that we use in our history to talk about how an artist will borrow something from mainstream culture or from a book or from another artist or from something How it differs from the term "copy" "I think when you appropriate something" "you tend to change it in some way" "Warhol by far and away" "was the biggest and most successful appropriation artist" "And we have cease and desist letters" "from Campbell's and Coca-Cola" But they realized very quickly that these were the most talked about works of art in the country and they should back off When Andy Warhol launched his Brillo boxes I think that the Brillo company thought this was a great advertising position for them "It was credibility for them" "on how the consumer responded to it" because of the product that was inside of the box And Warhol was no fool The design of the Brillo box It's mod, it's sexy It's a really great design Brillo "I think the box just depicts cleaning" It's a sink full of water with bubbles in it The original Brillo box was designed by an abstract expressionist painter named James Harvey "And James was in the school of Pollock" "and many of the other Ab Ex painters" "in that he had a day job to pay the bills" "and that he happened to be hired by the Brillo company" "to create what would become" "one of their most iconic and recognizable symbols" "of the company" "Warhol depicted the case that got shipped from the plant to stores" "So you saw this color of the box with the Brillo logo in the middle" In today's world, that would be a very expensive corrugated box to ship your product in "The first big show of the supermarket boxes" "was at the Stable Gallery in New York City" "Critics said "what on earth is thing? How could this be art?" "What is Warhol doing? Has he gone insane?" "It's the Emperor's New Clothes It's copying commercial product" And it's a big joke and a big sort of fake "Andy wanted to make it seem as though you were walking" "into the back room of a grocery store" "and had to climb through boxes" "It was his little way of making fun" that we, as consumers want to buy art just like we want to buy bananas "Warhol had dreams of people walking away" carrying a wooden box under their arm for a very low price That was a bargain for a Warhol even then And yet, no one bought them "When it surfaced that the original Brillo box" "was designed by the artist James Harvey" "The artist's supporters were incensed" "Jim's gallery the Graham Gallery" put out a press release about how this very fine abstract expressionist painter "had, in order to support his fine art" had to do this the base commercial art "And now he was being ripped off by this Andy Warhol" "I said, "What you should have done, Jim" "is while Andy was selling his Brillo boxes" "you should have been selling signed originals for ten cents each" "When Warhol's Brillo boxes were sent to an exhibition in Toronto" "They were stopped at the Canadian border" "Rejected as art and taxed as commercial goods" "Speak" "Earlier, a Canadian government spokesman" "said that your art could not be described as original sculpture" - "Would you agree with that?" - Oh yes - "Why do you agree?" - Well, because it's not original The Canadian incident is one of the best because it really is about the boxes themselves And the fact that the Canadian government didn't recognize the boxes as sculpture and wanted to charge a duty tax "They thought they were goods" "Played perfect into the hands of the media" "and it was perfect for Ivan and Andy" "in which to capitalize on to some degree" "Ivan was a perfect foil for Andy" "He was almost like Howard Cosell" Howard Cosell with, you know Muhammad Ali "Well, isn't this sort of a joke then that you're playing on the public?" No, it gives me something to do "Well, why have you bothered to do that?" "Why not create something new?" Because it's easier to do "The reality was, is this art? Is this the art we used to?" "Is this the European wing at The Met?" No, there's no wing at The Met yet I loved it "The Brillo box being presented as a work of art was unusual" "but people that appreciated pop art" "knew that pop artists were seeing things" "that the public instinctively appreciated" "He took things that originated in the world of commercial art" "for packaging and marketing of products" "and made them stand alone" "as visually pleasurable things to look at and own" "And all of sudden they took on a whole new meaning" "In 1969, my father bought his Brillo box from Ivan Karp" "for one thousand dollars" "It wasn't expensive so I decided to take a stab" "But I noticed that there was nothing on it" that said "Andy Warhol" "In my naivety, I pressed Mr. Karp" "to see what he could do about having Mr. Warhol" "authenticate the piece" "So Warhol got a big chuckle" "When Ivan Karp said that the fellow who wanted" "to buy his Brillo box insisted that he sign it" "And he graciously accommodated it with red crayon" It's probably the only Brillo box in existence that bears his... his signature may he rest in peace "It was a developmental milestone" "that you were able to lift your head and look at the camera" And that's how you found the picture in the album "Our family album shows me and my siblings" "literally surrounded by art" "But the Brillo box was hard to miss on our living room floor" The design was beautiful The three cents off was perfect for me "Most of our guests were amused" "And they wanted to say" "Put the groceries away put this in the kitchen" "Or could you recycle it?" But we didn't have recycling I had it encased in Plexiglas so it would be protected And it functioned as a little coffee table "What were you wanting to protect it from?" Well, you "We enclosed it in Plexiglas to preserve it" "You could put your drink on it" "and the baby" "I don't think I would put a drink on it" "But being that it was in the living room" It was protected and it could be Windexed But it was there for a short time "For my dad. collecting art was also a form of investment" "But my mother believed in holding onto things" I didn't want to part with anything because it was all so beautiful "and it was easy to bond with" "So my part was "Which wall?" "and "Is it straight?" "My father would sell one work of art to acquire another" "or to help support our growing family" "Our walls were constantly changing" "I started out not trying to be a connoisseur or anything like that" "but thinking that something I enjoyed doing" "could also just be another way of making money grow" I wasn't in it purely for the money It was just the fact that you could make money doing it made it all the more enjoyable "But it was very hard to tell what would be worth more" and everything that came in the house, to me was worth everything The art would be replaced and the cycle would start over "Years later, my mom gave me this advice" "Just because something seems to have lost its value now" "doesn't mean you won't wish you had it later" "Which brings us to 1971" "when my father traded the Brillo box" "to get a work by the artist Peter Young" "Peter Young was another rising artist of the sixties" "and he captivated the art world with dots" "His lyrical, dreamy images were everything the Brillo box was not" "I have always been curious about the mysterious artist" "my father traded our Brillo box for" "But there isn't a single piece of footage available of Peter" "So I imagine him something like this" Young Peter Young scene 1A, take one marker I remember this fellow particularly because one day, I was walking with my collector friend in Soho And Peter Young joined us for a stroll down the street and turned around and said to the two of us "Why are you guys buying art? You should be buying real estate" Peter Young did very psychedelic painting Very colorful psychedelic "People thought he was on drugs" "and no one knew what was going on in Peter Young's head" "Is it psychedelia? To some degree it is" "I was a meditator I was interested in white light" "I had a psychedelic experience where I saw space" "I saw a pattern And I started painting my dots" "We were a bunch of young artists trying to find ourselves" "in this world that was telling us that painting had died" It was an even trade of an artist "that Dad probably thought would in the end, be worth more" "I was able to trade that box for something I liked a little better" "and it intrigued me a little bit more" "I got something that I hung on the wall" "instead of something that sat on the floor" "There are no pictures of the Peter Young my parents acquired" "But we believe it looked something like this" "or this" "or this" What was going to become of Andy Warhol when he could trade it for a Peter Young? "You can't help prefer a Brillo box to a bunch of dots" "But Peter Young left New York and relocated to Bisbee, Arizona" "Just as his career was exploding" "He would not have a major show again" "in New York for over 35 years" "I didn't want to keep living in New York" "And I saw how particularly young artists" "might have a run of a season or two" "and then the caravan passes on, you know" "That's how our Brillo box was sent on its way" "With the money they made selling their art" "My parents were able to purchase their first apartment in New York" "Which they then filled with more art" "We spent every weekend as a family at galleries all over the city" "Soon they had built a collection" "that included abstract expressionists" "Pop artists and most of all the photorealists" "But the Brillo box became a family myth" "and a bit of a sore point between my mom and my dad" "Did Mom react when you sold the Brillo box?" "Do you remember what she said?" Well, not exactly a piece that you could say you really fell in love with "Why not?" Well, if you get right down to it it really wasn't all that attractive It was just the idea of it was more unique than the appearance of it Just a yellow box with some red lettering on it, you know, basically "I loved it because I loved what Andy was trying to show us" "Things we don't look at" "And I used Brillo These things you related to" "That was pop art" "It was art was all around us Art was all around us" "and that was Andy" "All the years I lived with the Brillo box in out Family album" "I didn't really think about what Warhol was trying to show us" "But I was in high school in the eighties" "I thought of him less as the artist" "And more as the intriguing figure who presided over nightclubs" "Handed out his interview magazines" "And celebrated the pop stars that I loved" "He was on The Love Boat TV show" "He painted portraits of celebrities" "He really painted himself into the picture of our mass culture" and he saw the adoration with which we ascribe to celebrities and famous people which is now gone way out of control Except now, we all want to see them die But then he wanted to celebrate them and situate himself right smack amongst them "Warhol's career totally tanked in the eighties" And just like in those early days everything that he was making was panned across the board Art critics hated it They said it was tacky it was too kitsch It was too, too It was just bad At his death in '87 he was not really important as a painter any more "When they showed the dollar painting show at Castelli" "He put them in the basement" He needed to give Warhol a show and he knew he wasn't going to sell anything And you put them in the basement I mean, it's unthinkable now that the first dollar bill show which I remember very well was in the basement "Certainly it made him depressed" "and sad that people weren't taking him seriously" "But it wasn't a new thing for him" "Many years after Warhol's death" "I found myself in a Los Angeles museum" "filled with white Brillo boxes" "And I began to wonder" "Whatever happened to our little yellow one?" "Where did it go once it left my family?" "And just as I began to search for it" "the answer suddenly appeared" "The yellow Brillo box had found its way from our living room flour" "to the very center of the art world" "The Christie's Evening Sale of Post-War and Contemporary Art" "It wasn't a faded photograph in our family album any more" Over the years, we would get these Brillo boxes that hadn't been well taken care of and it's coffee marks and spill stains "Often these changed hands considerably in their early days" No one envisioned anything having this kind of long term value "It turns out our yellow Brillo box had been bought" "and sold at Christie's several times before" "The first was in 1988 one year after Warhol's Death" "Our yellow Brillo box traveled to London" "to live with one of the most well known art collectors of all time" "The British advertising executive Charles Saatchi" "Our Brillo box didn't stay in England long" "In 1993, Saatchi decided to sell" "Having a well known owner like Saatchi in its history" "or provenance, raised its value" "This time, it was bought by a private collector in New York" "When that owner parted with our Brillo box in 1995" "Following a slump in the art market" "It was acquired for the exact same price" "by the collector Robert Shapazian" "The founding director of the Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles" "There in Los Angeles our yellow Brillo box was reunited" "with a family of Warhol's supermarket cartons" "and stayed in Robert Shapazian's living room for 15 years" "Robert understood way ahead of anybody" "the importance of the Brillo boxes and sought them out" "He would have known that this one was signed" and only three were signed and 15 weren't or something "At that time, Warhol really didn't sign a lot of things" To get something signed it is a big deal For those that really are connoisseurs and someone like Robert Shapazian who was, having that signature just clicked it for him "It was always so fantastic to walk in and see his installation" "Because the little yellow three cents off" "would sit like the crown jewel" As I entered his home I turned the corner and for a split second thought "He must be moving There are boxes on the floor" And then thought "No, those are sculpture" I think at first he was drawn to Duchamp "and I think it was a natural progression, to be led into Warhol" There was nothing low or high that escaped his radar "He would always head for the quirkiest things" "that no one would want" "He would just find these things You know" These things that... when they all came together they all made sense "There was, in front of the table a porcelain Chairman Mao" "who would be standing pointing" In back of you, two gigantic Warhol dollar sign "Down the line from Baldassare to Rochet to Courbet" "to Malevich to Warhol to Duchamp" The way Robert Shapazian collected was definitely a form of self expression And they were kind of like I felt like his children, you know? He was connected to each and every one If it was in Robert's apartment it was important It was like, by definition important "He had pieced together in his own mind" "his own sort of history of twentieth century art" "and knew that Warhol was the master" "There's only five people in the world who got it" "You know and Robert was one of them" "A few very prescient collectors did truly believe that Warhol would achieve stardom and fame once again And they were absolutely right There was this... all of a sudden this feeling amongst the people in the art world And it came on everybody at the same minute the same day Warhol is it "Warhol's going to last" "It's going to be Warhol" "There was a museum environment" "and there were shows happening around the world" "People understood it on a global level" And then all of sudden people wanted a Warhol "Because I think there was a sense that, you know" "we were entering into this philosophy" We were becoming aware of what he had been showing us for the last 25 years You know this is what it's about And in 1995 the Warhol market began And every year after that for the next ten years, it doubled "Robert Shapazian help onto out yellow Brillo box" "until his death in 2010" "Many of his works were donated to the Huntington" "and to major museums across the country" "including these white Brillo boxes" "The rest of his collection was sent to Christie's" "where it became part of the highly anticipated sale" "of Post-War and Contemporary Art" "And there our yellow Brillo box was assigned its very own lot" "and given an estimated value of $600,000 to $800,000" "Once it was announced we had the Shapazian sale" the phone was ringing and we were calling people and saying "This is an opportunity" "to add one of the most important Warhol works to your collection" "Not only a Warhol work but also rare sculpture" "There's people came in at our request" "and we even sent the box to their house to see it in situ" "and how it would live with other things" "They became very focused on what an opportunity this was" And while the estimate was very conservative we all knew that it was going to go more We didn't expect it to go to where it went "Our Brillo box had become one of just two left in private hands" "The rest of the yellow Brillo boxes had been dispersed" "to museums all around the world" "One even became swallowed by another sculpture" "And the Brillo boxes had come to be recognized as a turning point" "in the history of art" "I like to think about the Brillo box through Andy deciding to make it" And what an incredible kind of flash of genius to say "Take a Brillo box" "Turn it into sculpture and call it art" I mean, he got what we were about He said, you know, "Look This is what it's about" "It's about selling" "It's about making something appealing to be bought" "He calls attention to a world view" that is still the world we're living today if not more so "We buy, we shop we own, we have" "You know it's all about that" I mean, the world is more Warholian today than it was when he died "When our Brillo box was presented for sale" "that night in 2010" "It collided with the Great Recession economy" "Wall Street had collapsed and home values were plummeting" "Leaving art as one of the few reliable investments" "Meanwhile, new buyers from around the world" "including those countries that were once restricted" "were joining the global art market" "The art world had completely changed" "since my parents' days as young collectors" Good evening ladies and gentleman Welcome to Christie's and this evening's sale of post-war and contemporary art While you're taking your seats I will read you the announcements before we begin The emotional attachment and the will one has going into a sale thinking, "I'm going to take this home, this is going to be mine" "It becomes very strong" And you have a fair amount of responsibility "to give them a sense of expectation" "What's your worst case scenario?" "So that someone is psychologically" "and financially ready to meet the demands" of what the market has dictated that evening Sold at 1 million and 19 hundred dollars Brillo box is next Brillo box, showing on the screen there, lot ten Betting starting at 50 thousand dollars... I was on the telephone for a collector They wanted to be very anonymous They were on a telephone actually in the room "It sort of hid themselves in the group of other bidders" Here at 900,000 Against you, sir 950,000 on the telephone Sir? One million dollars in the room "There were so many people in the room as well as on telephones" "bidding for the three cents off" "And we ended up on the evening in the auction" "having this fierce bidding war" "with an international group of bidders of every level" In the room, one million dollars Telephones bid? One million 50 thousand dollars One million one hundred thousand dollars One million 150 thousand One million 200 thousand One million 250 thousand One million 300 hundred "You try and hold back and let the bidding unfold" "to the point where they can jump in" "and then just one against the other" "We thought there were several points" "where everyone else was going to fall by the wayside" "And just as we thought we were safe" "someone else would pop in" Two million dollars Two million one Two million and one hundred thousand That's a two million and 200 thousand Gentlemam bids again so that's two million and 200 against you sir Next in order two million and 250 thousand Two million and 250 thousand Two million and 300 thousand Two million and 350 thousand Two million and 400 thousand Two million and 450 thousand Two million and 500 thousand dollars Now its two million and 600 thousand Two million and 600 thousand dollars Will you match two million and 600 thousand dollars? Yes? Not yours? Selling in the room for two million and 600 thousand Something like three cents off it was so unlikely that one would ever be on the market or there would be one in this great condition with a great provenance and a signature in red crayon and all the wonderful history That's what inspired that collector to keep going $2,650,000 On the telephone Not yours, sold for the highest bidder for $2,650,000 Sold for $2,650,000 "That night, the Brillo box that had once been part of my childhood" "with auction house fees sold for over $3,000,000" "and disappeared from us again" "Was there ever a point where you thought about the Brillo box" "or wished that you had kept it?" "Well, very recently I did to my chagrin" The piece fetched millions "What do you think would make someone pay $3,000,000" "for a Brillo box now?" "It's a piece of art history" "An irreplaceable piece of art history" "When I see the Brillo box I could only have fond memories" "It was a point in time in New York history" "It was a point in time in artists' lives" "And it was a point in time in our home" "She probably would have preferred that I kept it" "Why do you think she would have preferred you kept it?" "I think she had a more innate appreciation of art and art objects" "If it were up to her I would have kept all of it" Of course, it would be great if you could hold everything, you know But many years ago that was not an option for me If I wanted to get more art I had to sell something I had And I often did that "As my career in law practice grew I had less and less time for that" "Going through art galleries every Saturday" "was not something that I was able to carry on" "through the rest of my career" "As my siblings and I got older" "visiting the galleries was something" "we stopped doing together as a family" "And eventually, most of the art my parents once owned" "moved on to other living rooms and other lives" "And some years later, my parents went their separate ways too" "When I see the Brillo box" "I think about my parents when they were young" "And the life we once had as a family" "Our life with art all around us" "And how none of us can really know" "the things that will endure over time" A lot of collectors add to their collection rather than delete We seem to press the delete button If I weren't around she might very well have done all that on her own "Maybe done better Maybe held onto things" "It was all a gamble" Do you like the gamble of the NASDAQ or do you want to look at a Jake Berthot that looks like it's missing? "There was a better lifestyle than sitting and buying stocks" which is a good idea too "And it was certainly fun to drag our kids along" "They saw things that was I'm sure, bewildering to them" "But to this day, I can see that" "they have appreciation for those things" "Like when you think of it now" "or if you went to a show or you saw a Brillo box?" What could I do? It had a place Life is change ephemeral, it left "Sometimes it feels like the sixties never happened" "The neighborhood of Ivan Karp's gallery is now a shopping district" "and the site of Warhol's factory" "has been turned into a parking garage" "But many things that were lost in the sixties are being rediscovered" "In fact, here in Arizona where I live now" "I have a neighbor I have been wanting to meet" Peter Young interview take one marker "Are people rediscovering my art and now talking about me?" Yes, I'm going to have to make my website a little better and my Wikipedia page needs to be updated "But everybody who owns my paintings" "are hanging onto my paintings" I'm 75 years old and I'm going to drop one of these seasons And then, my paintings will quadruple in value Hello Well I bet you can't remember me No, not quite.,but I mean do you remember me? I sure do Okay, a lot of the horizontals kind of pop out "Who knows? Maybe I will start spending a little time" "now that I'm thinking about it again" "maybe seeing if I can't do what I did 30 years ago" "and buy the work of evolving artists" And see if I can pick out the things that are going to make a dent in the art world "Today, artists appropriate Andy Warhol's Brillo box" "Like he once did to James Harvey's soap pad box" "The artist Charles Lutz" "even made hundreds of cardboards versions" "and gave them all away for free" "People walked down the city streets" "carrying away Brillo boxes as Warhol once envisioned" "And that's the story of how we got our Brillo box" "And one, two, three Smile" "I think I can only recall one thing we ever collected" "that didn't find a taker when I put it up for sale" "And that was a Chiparus sculpture" So if anybody seeing this documentary happens to want a Chiparus call me
