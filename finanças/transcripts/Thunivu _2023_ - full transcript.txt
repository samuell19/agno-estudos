AN UNFORGETTABLE MEMORY… Colocation scam! How did such a massive scam occur in the Indian Stock Exchange? Fifty thousand crore rupees scam in the Indian Stock Exchange! Seventy-five thousand crore rupees scam in the Indian Stock Exchange! Three lakh crore rupees scam! The SEBI Chairman opens up on the share market scam. The money value has not been calculated yet. Colocation scam! How did such a massive scam occur in the Indian Stock Exchange? High-frequency trading takes place at the New York Stock Exchange Wall Street, USA. While sending the stock exchange data to agents through fiber optic cable illegal servers were installed inside a nearby building which helped to steal the data a few seconds before the trading begins and profited an unidentified group. The unidentified group is infamously called, Flash Boys. India's Flash Boy, Sunil Dutta, stole the data from the NSE backup server of the Indian Stock Exchange thirty to sixty seconds before trading began indulging in the scam of millions. The CBI has started a probe and is diligently looking for Sunil Dutta. But the sources say he has fled the country. Keep looking for me, you fools. - Sunil Datta has... - Look at these fools! Oh, baby! CBI launched a probe to investigate the matter. Until the investigation is over… - CBI! - CBI! Mr. Sunil, you are under arrest! …his whereabouts are... Hey, who are you? Where are you taking me? Load the explosives! Careful! An entire pin code in Chennai will get wiped out if it explodes! Go to the shore! Hurry up before the police get here. - Hold it. - It has both, real and fake ones. - Check everything properly. - Okay, brother! Brother Radha, this is the real one, and this is a dummy. Radha, listen carefully! This is a miniature of the bank we're going to loot. Daily, the bank opens at 10:00 a.m. Once the bank opens, it will be swarmed with customers. - Bank managers and cashiers will be busy. - Achieve your target! Next! Next! If we enter that time, we can hold the public hostage take out the commandos, and easily steal the money. But the chest locker is guarded by commandos holding MP5 guns. That makes it challenging for us to enter straight into the currency chest. On May 21st, at 9:30 a.m., there is a product launch function. On the same day, there's an event at the Governor's residence. &amp;&amp; The CM and other higher officials will be attending the event. They'll easily take an hour to arrive at the heist spot. If we suddenly attack them and fix a bomb at the chest locker entrance, the commandos can't get out. At the same time, another team should enter through the main entrance and hold the public and staff hostage. After that, we can go through the veranda at the back and blast the wall between the bank and the chest then the commandos will be dead. Post that, we can quickly enter the chest and loot the money. The RBI limit allotted for the chest is 1000 crores. But… the inside information states that they've stashed 1,500 crores in there. If we steal the excess 500 crores, the bank won't utter a word, let alone file a complaint. Don't worry! We can easily steal the excess 500 crores. You will enter the bank and also steal the excess 500 crores. But how will you escape? I'm the Assistant Commissioner of that area. I'll take Inspector Rajesh, in charge of that area, on rounds. And will return late after I get the information. Once I arrive at the spot, you make a call to the Books and Bench building opposite the bank and threaten to kill the public if the police step inside the bank. Make a demand to send a helicopter for your getaway. The police, with no option left, will start to make arrangements. Meanwhile, you break into the locker and loot the money. Before the helicopter arrives, I'll request you to let go of the injured hostages. I'll come with this stretcher to pick up the injured hostages. We will similarly arrange the money and carry you people on the stretcher as injured hostages. In an hour, we will have 500 crores. Awesome! Let's go and loot the 500 crores! Good morning and greetings to everyone present here. I respectfully welcome Mr. Katta and Mr. Mehta to the launch of Your Bank's new Insurance Policy. Thank you! In the 25 years of its history, Your Bank has succeeded in creating 6,00,000 accounts with a deposit of 30,000 crores. Which branch is it from? The T. Nagar branch. It's from the T. Nagar Branch. 64, 185. Split! - Hey! - Hey! Everyone down! - Everyone face down. - No one moves! Hey! Hey! Face down! Come on! Commandos, explosives! Down! - If you dare open the gate, - Go inside! The bomb will explode. - Down! - Everyone face down! Down! Help! Help! Mobiles! Here you go! Hey, check there! There are people inside. Are you deaf? This is your last warning! If you don't abide by it, I will blow your head! Hey, who are you? Step outside! Tell me, who the gangsta? I said, who the gangsta? Come on! I said, who the gangsta? Silence! I'm here to loot the bank as well. This heist is mine! - Take all the money and stash it inside. - Stash it inside the locker. Don't go toward the gate. Move! Radha, get here soon! The commandos have entered. Lock him down. You go and secure the bank. - Go! - Everyone, get inside. Go! - Hey, move! - Damn it! Come on, everyone, get inside. Shoot! Charge! Threat alert! Your Bank! Threat alert! Sir, an SOS message from Your Bank, main branch. They would've triggered it by mistake. No one would even try to rob a bank in our city. Commandos, alert! Control room! Your Bank is under attack! Please don't shoot. Sir! Sir, I have two kids. - Two is enough. Tie yourself. - Please, sir! Aren't you ashamed of stealing people's money? No! Next, at 10:00 a.m., the old song program has an awesome song from the film Baghdad Thirudan. Before that, there's bad news for the commuters heading to broadway. If you're a Your Bank account holder, a dangerous gang with weapons has attacked the bank. The news is spreading on social media like fire! The commuters heading to Broadway divert to Jones Road on the right and keep driving straight. - I will keep you all posted - Threat alert! With the updates on the spot. - Sir! - Thiruna, I need your help! Always at your service, sir. I need details on the cars, - guns and, ammo used by the accused. - Okay, sir. Ask the sniper team and commandos to get to the spot. - I'll be there in an hour. - Okay, sir! Respected staff and the public… greetings! If a thief enters the bank, management studies advise the following. Rule number one… don't act like a hero. Rule number two… cooperate with the thief. Rule number three, try to identify the thief. Rule number four, call the police as soon as the thief leaves. That's it! Don't act like a hero. That's my job description. Go! Everyone, disperse! Bombs have been placed around the bank. Please hear me out! I hope the police did not follow us from the bank. No! Hurry up! What a moron! Messed up a heist and is whistling now! We diligently planned to loot 500 crores. But you intervened. Think big, my man! Five hundred crores, it seems! I'm here to loot 5,000 crores! He is lying! Unbelievable! I believe you. He's smart! If you follow my orders, you will get a share of the 5,000 crores as well. What if we don't? If you don't or won't adhere to my orders, the gun will get angry. Okay. - Deal! - Deal! - Manager, come here. - Sir! It's been a while since you triggered the alarm. Let's rebuke the police for not turning up. Sir, I did not trigger the alarm. Fine, let's trigger the alarm together. Have you lost your mind? How did you find out? Why are you informing the police? What? There's no kick in a heist without informing the police. Please spare me. I triggered it by mistake. Inspector Rajesh! - Sir, our bank is... - We are arriving! - How many are in there? - Nine! Tell me precisely! - Nine people? - Nine people, indeed! Fast! Move! Move! I asked you to scold the police. But you are getting me caught. Sir, please, sir! Please, sir. Tell them to let me go. - Do you remember rule number two? - Yeah! Cooperate with the thief. Smart! Sir, please! Sir, I have two kids. If you get up, it will trigger the bomb and explode. Side! Clear! Everyone clear out! Come on, clear out! Hurry up! Come on, help me lift him. Slowly! Hey! There's a CCTV opposite the bank. Pay and grab the footage. - No other channel should get it. - Okay Until we get out of the bank if anyone needs food or water… I will take care of it, sir. There's food ordered for the event. - You graduated MBA, right? - Yes, sir! I will deal with the police. You go and open the chest locker. Open it! The police shut down all the buildings. Wrap up! We need to shut the shop. Hello! Sir! Who is Antony out here? It's me. What do you want? The thief wants to speak to you. - Hello! - Sir, what took you so long? Hey, who the hell are you? Bloody accused! I'll break your bones. Step outside! Hello. Hello. - Sir… - Enough with the sass! As you spoke to me disrespectfully, I got worked up and shot a man! If he dies, you're responsible, Anto! Oh, no! Sir! Sorry, sir! Please don't complain to the inspector. I yelled at you as I was tensed. Sorry, sir! Sorry! Respect! Respect is two-way traffic, Anto. Fine, you're now one of our own. What would the police do when there's a heist happening inside a bank? Only the inspector and the AC would know. I can't wait for them to arrive. You have to deal with this case. I've made the decision! - You are the IO! - Aye yo? Not "aye yo." It's IO. Investigative Officer! First, block the road and clear the public. Then call me back with a pen and paper. - Okay, sir. I'll clear it immediately! - Brother, I need a favor. Block the road. Lock up all the buildings around the bank. Clear the public and all the vehicles. Go! Go! Run! No one should be here. Come on, leave! Everyone, get out! No one should stand on this road. Clear out! - Pull down the shutters! - There are bombs laid around the bank. Brother! Clear footage of six armed men entering the bank got captured on CCTV. Before I could get a copy, the police arrived. But I recorded the monitor on my phone. Shall I send this to the channel? - Don't send it yet. - Why? They'll complain about the video quality if you send it right away. You'll get yelled at! Wait for a while. They will be desperate to know if we got anything for them. Stall them by saying that you're trying. Later, send this footage. Next week, during the monthly meeting, you'll get the Best Employee Award and an increment of 1,000 rupees. Hey, Mai Pa, I hope he does not get you caught. I don't mind! Anyway, I'm bored with this channel. There's not one good-looking female there. All of them are lame! - Hello, madam! Good morning! - Hi, Mai Pa. I texted you this morning but you didn't reply. You got viral footage. Good job, man! I have recommended your name for the Best Employee Award and an increment of 1,000 rupees. Keep it up! Thank you, ma'am. Brother, you're great! As your senior, I should be a good role model for you. Go! Cover the metro station! - Hello, madam! - Check everything around. Six armed thieves are stepping out of the car. After stepping out of the car, three thieves are seen entering Your Bank. Tamil Nadu Head, Sam, is on the phone. What's happening, Sam? I have locked the bank codes. No transactions can be made by using the system. But there's an over-floating 500 crores beyond the RBI limit. If they steal it, we can't claim insurance. - That's my only worry, sir. - You fool! We are a developing bank. At this time, if there's a heist at a prestigious, heritage bank, our share value, reputation, and reliability will be affected. Sorry, sir. Understood! Those thieves inside shouldn't get out alive. Done, sir! I'll go to the spot. The inspector is arriving. Open the barricades! The accused put constable Antony in charge of the situation. - Sir, I'm the IO on this case… - Get out of my way! - Make the call to the bank. - Please hear me out, sir! Oh, no! Nonsense! POLICE My God! What's the total sum? One thousand five hundred and ten crores! I told you it's not possible to steal 5,000 crores. Only if we kill him can we steal and escape from here. Are you ready, Anto? This is ACP Ramachandran. Please give the phone to Mr. Antony. Who are you? I will speak only with Mr. Antony. He's an ordinary constable. Hereafter, you will speak with me. Give the phone to Mr. Antony, sir. Stop messing with me and come out of the bank. Give the phone to Mr. Antony, sir. You idiot! Do you even understand me? Tell me who you are. Tell me! What the… - Tell me, who the gangsta? - Fuck off. I said, who the gangsta? Come on! Hello? I shot two people. Shall I leak to the press that you were responsible for it? Sir, please… You arrived late to the spot and now you're being stubborn. That won't work, Rajesh. Tell me, is it fair? How does he know my name? - Sir… - Anto… This is the last warning. Inform them. You will be my only point of contact. Come on, move! - You can't go beyond this point. - Please let us in! Since 10:30 a.m., Your Bank, located on Gandhi Road is under the robbers' control. - There are six robbers… - Gunshots have been heard! It is feared that some civilians may have been killed. Sir, he is saying... - What is your connection with him? - Sir! - Tell me! - Please, sir! Please calm down, sir. Sir. I recorded his voice. See if you can find any clues. - How do we do it, sir? - To hell with you! You're asking me how?! Bloody! Get going! To hell with you! - He's going overboard. - Inspector! ATV channel bought all the CCTV footage. Please help us with exclusive footage. Turn around. I'll give you an exclusive. - Sir? - Get lost! You don't get it, do you? The scandalous college girl video that filed a complaint against you… Do you still remember? Come on, Mai. The AC humiliated me. I'm all worked up! Forget about it. Sometimes when cornered, you tend to bark aloud. Don't take it to your heart. You're too much, man! He's an ordinary constable. Hereafter, you will speak with me. Awesome! Hey, Mai Pa! Hey! But you've performed well in your scandalous video. That's enough! You failed to obey the order! - Sorry, sir. - Spare me the sorry. Go! Go and clean the entire place. And pick up all the empty bullets. What? Let him clean the toilet. Any questions? - No questions! - Spare me the horror. I should have shot you a few inches below. You got lucky! Not a big wound, though. Your wound will become more prominent if you fail to follow my orders. This is Ramachandran speaking. On May 21st, I will carry out the heist with Radha. Once they step outside with the money I will gun them down in the encounter and split the money. Traitor! I'm not a fool. I have recorded everything. Once I get out, I'll show him… We can mess him up right from here. Hand over the evidence. I will do it. First, tell me your original plan. Then I'll hand it over. You are quite smart! Tell me the plan! This bank is a treasure that holds millions of rupees. But stealing it all will take time. In the meanwhile, be calm and follow my orders. Deal! What's next? Check if you can find anything that does not belong to the bank. Madam! - Go live! - Rolling! We now have the voice of the leader of the bank thieves. We now have the voice of the leader of the bank thieves. People who can identify the voice, call us at 8-4-8-9-7-7-7-5-5-4. - Who's voice is it? - It sounds familiar. Do you recognize it? I recognize it. Sir! - Sir… - Did you find out? I found it. Tell me, whose voice is it? Sir, you see… Tell me, dammit! You've been hit by… You've been hit by A smooth Criminal! It's the voice of Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson? - Michael Jackson? - Yes, sir. Michael Jackson? Is Michael Jackson the thief at the bank? Michael Jackson? Who is that? I will only speak to Mr. Antony. The thieves mocked the police with a voice changer device. The public is teasing the police by making Michael Jackson dance videos. How the hell? In ten minutes, the war room should be ready. Ravindran here. I'm Chief Commando in charge. And I'll take control of the security. - Commandos! - Yes, sir! Take position. Run! Spread across the perimeter of the bank. Find out if there's a tunnel or exit that they could use for escape. Lock down the metro station. Check all the manholes! Get the bomb squad and snipers right away! Stop! Switch on the jammer. Strengthen the jammer. Neither the wireless nor the phones should work. - Come on, clear out the vehicles! - Come on! Come on, clear the area! - Is the war room ready? - Ready, sir! Collect the hard disks from the CCTV. - Run! - Wait outside. Go! Come on, connect the hard disk. We just have to report to the commissioner. - Start the work! - Okay, sir. Sniper, sir! Sandeep, Head in charge. What happened, sir? Nothing is going according to plan. Someone has double-crossed us. No one else is aware of our plan. We'll be exposed if we don't kill him before the commissioner arrives... - Sir? - Sir, who is he? Please manage to kill him. - Hello? Sir? - Sir, the snipers are here. The one who made the call must be the leader. If we take him out, the others will surrender themselves. - Take positions! Go! - Yes, sir! What are you doing? The commissioner has ordered to check all the CCTV footage on this road. In position, sir. - Antony! - Sir… - Call him and ask him his demands. - Okay, sir. Shoot him when he goes past the window to answer the call. Copied, sir! Zoom in! Zoom in! Okay, move to the next camera. - Sir, he did not answer the call. - Call him again! Damn! Sir… "Do you think I'm kidding?" He asked me, "Are you playing with the snipers?" - I'll thrash you! - Hey, go away. - Clean shot for me! - Shoot him! Sir! ACP Ramachandran used snipers to kill the thieves despite the warning. This outraged Michael Jackson! - On air! - As a warning to the police, hostages have been made to wear bomb vests. Please save me! Please fulfill whatever demand they put forward. I'm not sure if I will survive this. Now you're responsible for my family. They can use a wall scanner… and deal with the thieves inside the bank. They should use a dragonfly camera and inject him with poison. That will knock him down. Hopeless fellows! The police are amateurs! Shall we roll the camera? Not just in Your Bank, but during this government's rule, it's always been daylight robbery. Are you politicizing the matter? Come on! Don't get the wrong idea! What kind of law and order is the police maintaining? If something were to happen to the public… What if they are North Indians? It's obvious. They are the culprits. We need to chase them away. - How dare you stare at me? - Hey! Go back to your land! - Brother, don't jump to conclusions. Sit. - What is it? The commissioner is heading to Your Bank… Baby, your friend's bank is under attack. See! The thieves have warned the authorities that they would bomb the hostages if they cut off the internet, or come near the bank. - Hello! - Hey, Krish, what happened? What's happening at your bank? I'm in Chennai. Do you need some help? No need. Sam has gone to the spot. I need to speak to number three and then to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Sir, number three on the call. I'll call you back. Greetings, sir! It would be helpful if you could speak to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. The share value already has dipped by two rupees. I think other banks envy my growth. They must have planned this heist. I've already spoken to him, Krish. The CM promised to take care of it. Don't worry! Commissioner Dayalan is directly going to handle the situation. Sir, please. Sir! Sir, my husband, is held hostage inside the bank. Sir, my son is held hostage inside. Please save him, sir. The police take responsibility for bringing everyone out safely. Please get back home! - Antony? - Sir! What is your man saying? Sir, I don't know anything. It's scorching hot today. But your man seems to be handling it cool. I concur the bank is air-conditioned. I swear on my grandma. I don't know anything. He shot down commandos in broad daylight. And is holding the public as hostages inside the bank. What is his escape plan? - Bring me the bank's blueprint. - Yes, sir. - Check if a helicopter has been hired. - Yes, sir! Check for coastal movements. - Also, alert our entire department. - Okay, sir. I need to speak to the injured commandos over the phone. Sir! Sir, I have two kids! Help me, sir. It's not like you asked for my permission. Oh, my God! - Ask them to count the money. - Sure! - And you record it on video. - Okay. Kabila, if you suspect anyone, inform me right away. Madness! Be careful. Please be safe. I've informed the commissioner. You explain the issue. Sir, I'm Sam Jacob. Your Bank, Tamil Nadu State Head. As the floating was more we stored extra 500 crores inside the chest. If they steal that money, the bank will be in trouble. Sir, they have taken insurance from our company. If they steal the money, the company will incur a huge loss. Sir, we'll sponsor food and beverages for your entire team. - Let's go, sir. - Sir… Not even a piece of paper will leave the bank. Don't worry. Wait in the safe zone! Ram! - Sir! - Sir! We are done with two cameras. Five more to go! - One more hour. - Fast! Sir… If you don't mind… what if we check and fulfill his demands? Ask him! Ask and fulfill it. Record! Sir… If you state your demands… To get away after stealing the money, I need a… Tell me, sir. Do you need a car? How about a helicopter? What do you prefer, sir? I need a… One… I need a submarine. A submarine? Submarine? A ship that submerges inside the water. A submarine. It sounds absurd, sir. Why would you need a submarine? It's a large sum of money, Anto. If I carry such a large sum in a car… you will capture me before I make the turn. Sure, sir, we will! If I load the money in a submarine… you can't chase me. Once I cross the Indian border, I'll return it. Sir, only the military has the submarine. Please hire it for a day. - Tell me something, Antony. - Sir? Is there so much money in the bank that he needs a submarine? Sir! - Did your partner not tell you? - Sir! - Sir! - Sir, please give us some news! It's not fair to give all the news to ATV. Parents are not at home No one to prevent us - Do you have it? - Yes! What do you want? You reminded me of it. Is that college girl still in contact with you? Hey, she has been asking me to introduce her to the AC. She has high expectations. Inform her… that I'm being transferred to the flower market next week. The bribe will get me five lakhs a month. Why don't you buy me bling? I'll stand guard. Won't you hold a light for us? Come on. My eyes can't forget her face. Are you sure it's just your eyes or… Check if she's free. I'll meet her after arresting this thief. What are you if he's a thief? - How about you? - Everyone is a thief. Parents are not at home The brave commissioner is mocked by Michael Jackson. Memes on the commissioner are going viral. It's been hours since the thieves have held hostages. But there are no updates on the situation. We need to shoot them down on this same road. He knows all of our names. He knows every detail of what's happening on the outside. When we begin investigating a criminal, this is how they hype them up. But when he gets arrested, beaten up, and pleads for life… he appears to be a joker. I wish to see this fellow as a joker. I will! As there are many memes online mocking the commissioner, he has issued a statement. Greetings! I have been noticing all the memes online. The millions of rupees inside the bank are the people's money. The bank uses that money to issue loans to its customers. The loans have educated many. It gave birth to many businesses and offered jobs. The aim of the bank is not just to make money. It's a social service. If the bank's administration is defeated, it'll directly affect the country's economy. If a bank is getting robbed, people should rather be worried. How many of you got worried while laughing at the memes? A group of people from outside is helping the group of thieves inside the bank. If all of you are determined, you can stop them. Inform us if you find anything suspicious happening around you. Don't forget that we are here to protect you with our lives at stake. Jai hind! How does he know everything that is happening out here? Cut the feed of all the CCTV cameras on this road. Clear all the press out of the vicinity. Come on, remove the camera! Everyone clear the area. The live feed is down. We are running out of time. - Did you figure out the plan? - No! I'm still looking for it. I'll find it soon. Be alert! Okay, doctor! Sir, Chief Commando is on the phone. Can you identify any of the criminals inside the bank? They were wearing masks! One was wearing a white shirt. And the two others were wearing black. One was wearing green, and another blue. The one wearing the white shirt was gritty and mad, shooting down people. - How many in total? - Nine members! - So, three were already inside the bank. - Yes, sir! - Access the bank's main server. - Yes, sir! Check if you can find the footage of him entering the bank in the morning. Check on the other side. - I could not find anything. - Why are there so many cylinders? Sir! The coastal area is clear. There are no bookings for a helicopter. The bank's blueprint is ready, sir. State-of-the-art explosives! If it explodes, it will blow up half the bank. Sir, he's the only one wearing the white shirt. But he's wearing a mask. Cross-check his photo with criminal records for details. How did it get past the bank security? And why is it here? There's a third team inside the bank. This heist has caught the country's attention. But the commissioner is catching up. What shall we do? That's what we want. Let's begin! Sir, we checked the surroundings. There are no escape tunnels. We swept the entire perimeter. There's no way they could escape. Had there been no hostages, we could've broken in. Despite the jammers, how did they manage to blast the car? Check all the manholes. Lift it! Come on, get inside. Okay. That's about it! Sir! West! Hey, did you see a vehicle out here? A telephone van just went past. Control room! Your Bank Operations! Hello, Dhatchna. I found out who double-crossed us. - Come right away! - Dilli, bring out the bikes! How did the bomb come inside the bank? Who brought it in? If you don't say, I'll start shooting people one by one. I swear I don't know anything. I have no clue about it, sir. You've been torturing us for four hours, depriving us of water. Don't you have any humanity? Take him along with the other staff members and check thoroughly. Come on, clear out. Sir, he saw everything. Speak up! A lady stepped out of the van, got into a black car, and drove away. License plate number 7-3-7-2. They have started running. We are nearing them! Send a message to all the stations to arrest that girl. Okay, sir. Stop the car! - Stop the car! - Go to our hideout. Kanmani, step outside! You can't cheat us and get away with the money. What do you want? I did not believe you. She looks awesome! I'm going to enjoy every moment. Don't do it, madam! Please spare me, madam. Madam, don't do it! Madam, please spare me. Madam, don't do it. Madam! Hey… Mahesh, take me to Your Bank. Job done! I planted Radha's evidence on him. I'm heading toward the next stage. If you go to the city center car parking right away, you will find five dead bodies and information about who planned the heist. I'm the Assistant Commissioner of that area. I will arrive first at the spot. You make a call to the Books and Bench building opposite and threaten to kill the public if the police step inside the bank. Sir, what's happening? Sir… You used the sniper to kill him so that you will be spared. Confess! I agree that I planned to loot the bank. But it's not my team that's inside the bank. The entire plan was made by Sam, The Your Bank Tamil Nadu Head. Cheers! Sam and I are friends from school. It does not matter whom you use for the heist. I need a 20 share. One hundred crores! As soon as the plan to conduct a heist of 500 crores was made I started to look for professionals who could pull it off. And that's when I found an agent. There's one man for the job! Dark Devil is wanted by many agencies and countries. Twenty jobs in ten years! Zero failures! Who the? Who the? Who the? Who the gangsta? You infuriate him He will laugh One who paves his path One who creates history He's like a gangsta He's a gangsta Empathizes with his enemies One who possesses the trait To bow with courage He's like a gangsta Hell, he's a gangsta We got a new project from Bangkok! This Bangkok gold smuggler double-crossed and looted the 500 kilos of gold that was supposed to get delivered to Kerala. To retrieve the gold, we have intel that Dark Devil and his team are arriving in Bangkok. As it is, we are wanted by Bangkok Police. If we go to Bangkok, we won't return. Many countries failed to capture him, but we are going to succeed. Chief, it's a high risk! Who the… Who the gangsta? I said, who the gangsta? Come on! Tell me, who the gangsta? Tell me, who the gangsta? Gangsta! One who wages war Without losing confidence It's him! Gangsta! One who stands by you till the end It's him! I said, who the gangsta? Though he's violent His eyes show peace It's him! Tell me, who the gangsta? Knowing the depth of the Bay of Bengal If one plunges in He's a gangsta Gangsta! If you are courageous Victory is ours If you are courageous Victory is ours Come on, we will strike back You are doomed Wait and watch the strike back No more conflicts Be fearless, soar high Break the shackles, be valiant Let the people stand against you I am a gangsta! You are surrounded! Surrender or die! To hell with you! Tell me, who the gangsta? Gangsta! Gangsta! Surrender or die! Surrender! Gold? It's there! He's the man. I want him! Can we contact him right away? No phones! We can only meet him in person. There's a currency chest at Your Bank, Chennai main branch. They have stashed 500 crores above RBI's permissible limit. The plan is to loot the extra 500 crores. What I'm trying to say… As Dark Devil refused to take up the job, I planned the heist with Radha's team. They all look happy, not knowing that death awaits them after the heist. Rascal! The people will shun the police department because of your actions. - Bring me Sam. - Yes, sir! Go! Go fast! Change the car and go to the airport. Hey! Stop! Auto! Stop! - You? - I am, indeed! It was he who wired and planted the bomb inside the drainage. Also, he visited this coffee shop. Search! Go! Come on, fast! Smart! Smart! - Commissioner is smart, Anto! - Smart? I take it as a compliment. My best wishes to you to defeat me. Mr. Thiruna, the commissioner informed us to nab him as soon as possible. His name is Valavan! The police are here! Go! Run to your mother! Hey! Sir, we captured Valavan's aide. I will bring Valavan to you in an hour. Where is Valavan? And who supplied him the gunpowder? Sir, it wasn't through the quarry route but the sea route. Shadow area activity nil. And operation, stand by. Nil activity found in the area. Reporting to operations, surveillance clear! Eyes on the sky! He's a notorious criminal. But why did he turn up after rejecting the offer? Instead of proceeding with the heist, why is he playing around? Here! Stop! Turn around! Turn around. Sir! The Dark Devil and the team that Ramachandran mentioned are not alive! If the Dark Devil is dead, who's inside the bank? Is he one of the brothers? Or someone else? You better confess! Don't lie about his death. I swear, it's him who's inside the bank. - I'm sure about it! - Don't keep lying. - Lock him up! - Sir, please! Sir, my men have planted - dummy bombs at the entrance. - Go away! If we break in, we can take him out. Please trust me, sir! Move! Hey! Run! Now, do you trust me? It's a dummy! Let's go inside! Come on! Boom! Anto! Commissioner wished to see me as a joker, right? If you repeat this mistake, the commissioner will witness worse. Mind it! Salute us as well! The commissioner has assigned a spy. It would be best if you toned down your antics. Get to the point! It's huge! Come on! Get away from here! Is this what you call governance? If they're incapable, they should resign. I will take care of it. The governance is so bad that the police indulge in a heist. Make a call and shut him up! Where the hell is he? I'm ashamed to say that this is happening under my governance, DGP. What the hell is the commissioner up to? He's all talk! He's only fit for a desk job and push files. Sir! Sir, DGP… - Sir! - CM ordered to end the drama. Negotiate, bring him out, and do whatever it takes. Okay, sir! Yes, Anto! Sir, could you please state your demands? Do you even realize the pain you have been causing the public? I have shut the door and am lying down in peace. The police have put up roadblocks that are disturbing the public. Please go from here. I'll speak to the owner! - Owner? - Chairman! Isn't he the owner of the bank? Kill that bastard! Rascal! It's because of him the share value dipped by four rupees. If there were no hostages, we would've killed him ourselves. Please cooperate with us. I'll speak to him over the phone. Connect me. You may speak, sir. Hello! To continue in Tamil, press one. To speak in English, press two. To know about our plans, press three. Are you trying to piss me off? Who are you? And what do you want? To know everything, meet me in person! I can't meet you in person. This year you visited this branch eighteen times. Won't you make the nineteenth visit? I found the bomb! Chairman, sir! Come! Please leave me! Please! Who the hell is he? How did he find the bomb? - I don't know. - Idiot, you messed it up! It's not 500 crores, damn it! It's bloody 25,000 crores. Dammit! Partner, you were right about it. The 25,000 crores are inside the bank. I need the money I need the money It was my plan all along! You visited eighteen times. You visited eighteen times. Shall I pull the CCTV footage every time the Chairman paid a visit? Start! They found the bomb. We're inside the chest. I'm coming to Chennai. Before I get there, I want the bank under our control. Sir, number three wants to talk to you immediately. Krish, you're taking a huge risk. Don't go inside the bank. He does not know who he is messing with. I will show him who I am. As per his demand, the Chairman will come inside the bank. Antony, inform him not to harm the chairman. Sir, I hope you have heard it. The chairman is entering the bank at his own risk. Subjected to his own risk! Go and wait at the currency chest. Everything is a dummy! Are you a hero or a villain? - Hello? - We've taken control here. Speak to him! Apologize to him! Sorry, sir! To speak in English, press one. To continue in Tamil, press two. To know about our plans, press three. You summoned me, right? Here I come! Scary! Hello, sir! Agree to all of his demands and bring him out. I heard him say that he had found a bomb! Is it safe to go inside the bank? Don't worry, sir! The central minister has asked me to take care of you. If there is any problem, just shout for help. - We'll come inside. - Please be careful, okay? Sir, we lost the mic's signal. You complicated a simple matter. Execute our plan! My idea was to just blast the chest. But now innocent people are going to die because of you. After the blast kills the people, I'll kill you as well. Then we'll step out after giving ourselves some minor injuries and blame everything on you. You made a demand for a submarine. You blew up a car! Also, some police personnel died due to the blast. So, whatever we say, the police will believe us. If he does not reveal his identity or purpose within ten seconds, shoot him. Sir, it's hurting! If you ask them to take off the guns, I'll narrate a flashback that'll stun you! My team is my family. Kiss rule, Keep It Simple, Stupid! This is our life policy.

Jijo and Achara returned after recovering from the Bangkok hit. I heard that you finally proposed! As Jijo and Achara met at Araku Valley for the first time they wished to get married there. That's why we came to India. Kanmani! Hey! Fuckers, bring it on! Stay calm! Remember who we are! Down! Back! Fucking hell! This is how you shoot! Hey, dude! Do you need some light? Eat this! Safe! Flare! Flare! Kanmani! - Kanmani! - I got hit by a second bullet. - In the abdomen. - No! - Shall I tell you my last wish? - No! Kanmani! Kanmani? Kanmani! Cold… I'm feeling cold, partner! Kanmani… Kanmani! Start the car! Dasa, bring a doctor to the location I'm sending you. Hey! Brother, there's no dead body inside the car. I think it got stuck in the trees. Dasa, the sixth bottle of blood, is in transfusion. It'll be safe if we take them to the hospital. The police are on the lookout. You can ask me for anything, and I'll bring it. Please save them! Dangerous gang war! The Dark Devil gang, wanted by many nations, got killed by their enemies. After recovering Dark Devil's burnt corpse, the police launched a probe. Is that him? He fainted! Call for an ambulance! Who ordered the hit? I'll confess! It's Your Bank's Sam! Your Bank's Sam ordered to kill everyone. Our Chief is alive. But why did the news state he's dead? When our men checked, there was no dead body inside the car. To get our balance payment of 50 lakhs, we picked up two random people, burned them, and handled the police. Krish, I got everything you asked for. Not over the phone. Come over. We'll speak in person. It was the chairman's plan, not Sam's. Tell me the complete plan. I need to make other arrangements. He is Radha. His team will carry out the heist on May 21st. Once the job is done… Ramachandran will shoot them down in an encounter. He will take half as his share. And will account for the other half to the police. If you kill me, the audio clip will reach the commissioner. Tell me, what do you want? It's not like I'm going to ask for alcohol inside the bank. Okay, you can take the 500 crores. We'll make a compromise! Hand over the evidence. What about the rest? The total sum is 25,000 crores! What? Did you forget? Shall I help you remember? You dug too deep, my man! Death is inevitable for you. Sir, we found Sam. We found an abandoned car one kilometer away. When we checked… Sir! Please help me, sir! I'll confess! One day, Chairman without any explanation asked me to hire someone to loot only 500 crores from 1500 crores inside the chest. I approached my friend ACP Ramachandran. He approached Dark Devil. But the Dark Devil refused the offer. He refused but was aware of the plan. I panicked as what if he double-crossed us? I paced myself. And started to look for another team. Also, I assigned a person to watch the Dark Devil. As I suspected, unprecedentedly, he had arrived In India. To avoid any risk, I ordered to kill the team. But two members managed to escape. I confessed everything I knew. Please save me! Bastard! - Please save me! - Diffuse the bomb! Sir! Sir! - Run! - Sir! Sir! Prem! Chairman, Sam is dead. Try to save yourself. I need to investigate you. You are next! Shoot him! What happened? It's not firing! A dummy bullet won't fire. Beat the shit out of him! You're making a mistake by instigating a sly person like me! Who the gangsta? Hey! Tell me, who the gangsta? Come on! Tell me, who the gangsta? Tell me, who the gangsta? Gangsta! One who wages war Without losing confidence It's him! It's him! Gangsta! One who stands by you till the end It's him! It's him! I said, Who the gangsta? Gangsta! Come on, we will strike back You are doomed Wait and watch the strike back No more conflicts Be fearless, soar high Break the shackles, be valiant Let the people stand against you I am a Gangsta Gangsta! I'm a villain! Sir, break open the window and escape. After killing me… you can't escape from here. Every five minutes, play two ads. Stagger Live telecast accordingly. Got it? Okay, ma'am! And don't say no to ticker tape ads. Accept everything and keep scrolling. They have sent an exclusive video from inside the bank. On air! Let's watch exclusive news sent to our channel by the bank robbers. Greetings! I too heard what the commissioner spoke to you people about the bank. Yes, he's right! Bank is just not a business. It's a service too. Let me tell you all about an incident. We'll find out if the commissioner was correct or not. Maximum customers were acquired for a Credit card, insurance, PL, mediclaim, mutual funds, FDs and targets were achieved. The best employee of the year award goes to… Solomon, Porur Branch. Rishi, T. Nagar Branch. - Well done! - Thanks, sir. Shahrukh and Vishak, Tambram Branch. All of them have won a five-day trip to Goa. Please give them a big hand! The others, too, should achieve their targets across the line of products. Sir, many people refuse to buy credit cards. It's tough to achieve the targets. Muthuazhagan! Listen, you need to trap the customer. A simple trap won't lure the customer. Lace the trap with treats. Treats? Would your sibling trust and lend you money without interest for fifty days? Convince the customers that the bank will lend them money. "Please buy a credit card, sir. Use only when you need it." Or tell them to let it rest in their wallet. They will buy it! If they fail to pay back in fifty days… the bank charges 36 interest. Interest on interest! In three months, the debt will double. Aren't we obligated to inform the customers? Do you know why we ask you to wear a tie? - To look decent. - No! To prevent you from speaking the truth. - Are we supposed to lie? - We are not lying! We are hiding the truth. That's it! - Isn't it wrong? - If you believe in it, you'll get paid. See, if you die, who will look after your family? When we are selling insurance… Until there's a situation that calls for a third person for help we sell insurance. Also, until money defines one's respect and stature, we would sell loans, debit cards, and credit cards. All the best! Prem, transfer that boy to another product. If he still performs badly, then fire him. - Yes, Sam! - Offer a lot of ESOPs like Goa trips, incentives, gift coupons, etc. Only then can we reach our targets. Done, Sam! They're torturing us with targets! What happened? Why do you have a long face? I was struggling with PL and credit cards. Now they transferred me to the mutual funds department. It's a matter of the upper middle class. They gave me a list of potential account holders of our bank. What's stopping you? Use the list and make the call. Next year we'll get the Best Employee Award. And go on a Goa trip together! - Greetings, sir. - Hello. I'm calling from Your Bank RLY Mutual Funds. Hello, If you invest your money in the mutual fund we suggest… your money will double in four years. - Returns are 25 percent. It'll double! - Superb plan, sir. This year the best employee award goes to… Mr. Kavin, Thoraipakkam branch. Due to excessive loan approvals, three banks have gone bankrupt. Followed by Your Bank RLY Mutual Fund going bankrupt. What happened to 25,000 crores that belonged to the five lakh customers? The CBI has launched a probe! I don't understand the news. I entrusted you with my money. You asked me to trust you as my son and invest the money. You asked me to trust and invest. - Step out of the house. - Brother, please spare me! How dare you cheat us? Brother, please, I beg of you! Ignore, switch off the phone and continue with your work. Sir, how could you not be bothered about it? Our bank recommended investing in mutual funds. The mutual funds company invested in the share market and incurred a loss. What can we do? Please go. You won't understand. Explain it so that I understand. If not, I'll go to the police. You took signature on all the forms and it's mentioned in it that money will be lost if the company goes under loss. Did you read that clause to the customers? Then you will be behind bars. A 25,000 crore loss that belonged to five lakh customers. If we try explaining it to the public… they would not understand. What is money? Why is the dollar determined as the world's reserve currency? Where do we invest? Where should we not invest? For what should we take a loan? And for what, should we not take a loan? The customers should know! Customers should save themselves. There's nothing we can do. Leave it to fate. That's about it! I entrusted you with my money. You asked me to trust you as my son and invest the money. Customers should save themselves. - Welcome, Krish! - Thank you, Sam! - Krish, welcome to Chennai. - Thank you. Thank you, Prem. - Money! - Return it! Sir, thousands of people with weapons are headed toward the office. We can't withhold until the police arrive. - Money! - Return it! - Money! - Return it! - Money! - Return it! Money! - Return it! - Stop, it! Immolating yourself won't bring back your money. Everyone, disperse! Who told you we were here to immolate ourselves? We did not commit any mistakes. This petrol is to burn you all. If you don't return our money, we will burn down the building! Prem! How did the public know that I was coming down to Chennai? I don't know, Krish! I informed the public. Today, if you don't return the money, no one would make it out alive. Guards! Until the police get here, go inside and stay safe. Go! - Money! - Return it! - Money! - Return it! - Money! - Return it! - Money! - Return it! - Hey! Move! - Money! Return it! A case has been filed in court. Once the verdict is out, they will equally divide and return what is left. Only after we die, the verdict will be out. We get insulted and humiliated even to make a rupee. It's not fair to cheat the public. We struggle a lot daily to make a living. Sir, please help us get our money back. Brother, this is a financial crime. You, your father… or even if the Government intervenes it can't recover even a rupee from me. Sir, it'll be better if you return the money. I have strong evidence that'll expose this scam. If I take it to the press, you can't even step out in public. The public will beat you up. Really? A few years ago… a cricket team was banned for committing fraud. - Do you remember? - How is it related? It does. In a few years, the cricket team returned to the tournament. Rightfully, what should the public have done? The team broke the public's trust. It brought shame to the game of cricket. The public should have protested! Or should have expressed angst. Instead, what did the public do? They stood in queues, spent thousands, and bought tickets in black. They protested for the wrong reasons and got thrashed by the police. They claimed to sacrifice their lives for that team. What do you learn from it? The public does not care about good or evil. Similarly, they will forget about me. I will once again be ready to cheat them. And the public will be ready to get cheated. For the public, the one who entertains them is their leader. The one who entertains them is a star. Not the one who preaches! Or like you, who speaks of justice. Sir, have some conscience. - Money! - Return it! - Money! - Return it! Money, brother. Money! - Money! - Return it! If the public believes in one lie, businesses will start manufacturing it. What can I do? I'm a businessman too. Ask the people to look for the truth. And elect a good leader. Until then… - Hey! - Money! Return it! - Money! - Return it! - Money! - Return it! - Money! - Return... Hey, what the hell? - Hey, let's run away. - Call for an ambulance! The public broke into the building and pushed over Your Bank staff from the top floor. Ask your friend to do his job! Charge! Everyone, disperse! Charge! Everyone, disperse! Begin your atrocities! Are you trying to fool us? - Pour the petrol. - Come on, run! Come on, run! Keep running! Everyone, run! He is still breathing! Shall I strangle him? Don't touch him. It's evidence. Keep circling until he dies. Despite the fall from the top floor, he refuses to die! I have been circling for an hour now. He's still alive! I'll strangle him. Manipulate the postmortem report. This is the AC speaking. Your son, Kavin has committed suicide. Your Bank and RLY Mutual Fund company incurred a loss and became bankrupt. But due to a lack of evidence, a charge sheet can't be filed. The police department has submitted a report to the court. I was happy that my son was the first in the clan to be educated and had a job. But they killed him! We could not do anything about it. What could we do? We don't have money! We don't have power! When we get beaten or killed, we plead to God to save us. But God does not appear. He prayed for God to appear. But God sent the Devil instead. Kavin wished that people got their money back. Hence we're going to ask the chairman about the 25,000 crores that belong to people right away. Commissioner, send in Antony along with the press. He has demanded to send in the press. - What is your demand? - Two! News channels are running at a loss. The owners are running the channel to save their pride. - What about half? - Okay! - Liquid cash! - Okay, I will try. Brother, he demanded one lakh, and you agreed to it. Hey, Mai Pa! What the hell are you doing over there? You talk too much about your seniority. The new guy is going to get the Best Employee Award with an increment of 1,000 rupees. Stop lurking behind women. I'm negotiating with the main source. It's a lifetime, live opportunity! But he's demanding 10,00,000 rupees in cash. I tried to hit him below the belt as well. He does not seem to budge! Fix the deal. I'll send the cash. Okay, madam! You can keep your 1000-rupee increment! Bloody fool! They always pick such intelligent fools to run management. Let her die. Let the public die as well. I'm not going after any management position for a while. I believe you're surprised. We will soon get 10,00,000 rupees. Keep it with you. Why are humans such opportunists? You see, Mr. Best Employee, being an opportunist is what makes one a human. The game of cruel people I will come back from the washroom. Get a glass, you'll need it. The game of cruel people Mai Pa, please help us with leftover content. Click a picture of the bank and post it on your channel's Twitter account. It'll trend well! And Twitter will make money. I'm watching everything. Tell me! Sir, please cut the live feed and save the chairman. It's a huge struggle to crack a deal worth 15 percent. How did you guys manage to swindle 25,000 crore rupees so easily? I should've listened to my father and gotten an education. Sorry, Father! PA, I need 50 percent. If you can't, you may handle it yourself. I'll make sure you get your share. Please save him! Did your father ask for education or power? Hey, commissioner, what's happening? Won't you pick up the phone if the DGP or the Central Minister calls you? This telecast should not go on air. Send in the police and take him out. Sorry, sir. This will put the public's life in danger. I will handle it. You send in the police. Please document the same and send it to me. I'll send in the police. Sir, I hope you heard him. What shall we do with him? - The usual treatment. - So be it! If Mai Pa does the interview I'll pay two crore rupees. Understood? - How much did he quote? - Two crore rupees! - Two crores? - Yes. Please help! Done! Hey, Mai Pa, you and the cameraman, will go inside the bank in ten minutes. No way. I'm not going inside the bank. - You have to go! - My man will rock it! No doubt! - Go ahead, Mr. Best Employee. - Hey, fool, have you gone mad? If I go in, who will report the news to the channel? - I will report it. You go ahead! - Come on! Come! The game of cruel people It's a risk! Antony will accompany you. He has not killed any hostages. So, don't worry. They are offering one crore rupees. We will split fifty-fifty! Really? Okay, let's go with it. No guts, no glory! No guts, no glory! No guts, no glory! No guts, no glory! Why did you make everyone sit in rows? You need to sign the agreement before you speak. This is the agreement! Read and sign it! Why is it in the fine print? I used the same font size as your bank form. What is it, Antony? Is everything moving according to our plan outside? Why is the press here? I'm going to prove it to the people over a live telecast. I cannot agree to go live. Chairman, you have signed the agreement. You signed and agreed to share your information with anyone. This rule, too, was taken from the Your Bank form. - Live ready, sir! - Hey, shut up! What did I do? Please, let's not go live! Please forgive me! Even if we wish to forgive, your CIBIL score is less. Start camera! Rolling, sir! Yes! Yes! Live it! Action! Where are the 25,000 crores which were invested in your mutual funds? Our bank has no connection to it. Sir, the bond bears the name of your bank. Your Bank RLY Mutual Funds. We hold only a 40 share. - The rest of the 60 belongs to them. - Sir… - let me explain in detail. - Please! Sir, our bank and the mutual fund company are like siblings. - Oh! - What can the elder brother do if the younger brother makes a mistake? If my younger brother makes a mistake, I will question him. I cited the wrong example. I'll explain in detail with another example. We adopt and raise an honest child. What can we do if he turns out a rogue? Why do you even adopt if you can't raise a good child? I'm not going to cite any more examples. I'll come straight to the point. We, too, incurred a 40 loss! Rightfully, you should've questioned them first! You can discuss it yourselves. See, violence is wrong. You should not beat anyone. The agreement states I can beat you if you don't give me the correct answer. You have signed the agreement. Tell me, where's the money? Don't you understand? Like you people, I incurred a loss too. How could you ask me? Then who should I ask? It would be best if you asked the Mutual Funds Chairman, Harsha! - Oh, so I should ask him, you say. - Yes! So, Mutual Fund Chairman, Harsha, wherever you are, please come to the show. Shall we go, sir? I'm held captive, and you're asking my permission? Go! A short break until the next chairman joins us. Stay tuned! Shankar, did you happen to see Valavan? I'm trying to figure out how to pay the EMI this month. And here you are, asking me silly questions. - Get lost! - Tell me, Shankar. I'll pay you. It's a complicated case. He left at 4:00 a.m. on Arogyaraj's boat. Start the boat! Sir, the footage of the chairman's trips, has been erased. Pull out the footage from the traffic cam on those dates. Yes, sir! As there's a slight delay for the next chairman to arrive, the customers can raise any questions regarding issues with Your Bank. - Sir. - Sir. - Sir. - Sir. I opened an account and deposited 5,000 rupees. Ten months later, when I wanted to withdraw, the balance was zero. When I questioned, he gave me jargon. Zero balance accounts were canceled. You should maintain a minimum balance of 5,000 rupees. There were 5,000 rupees in the account. Sir, it's 40 rupees per month for an SMS alert. If we deduct 40 rupees as SMS charges during the first month the account is left with a balance of 4960 rupees. - Oh! - It does not meet the minimum balance. Oh! The penalty for not maintaining the minimum balance is 500 per month. In ten months, 5,000 rupees were debited due to recurring penalties. Oh! Precisely, she owes money to the bank. To hell with you! Had it been in a piggy bank, it would still be safe. Sir, they torture you over the phone and sell the credit card. Earlier, during emergencies, I used to borrow from my friends. As I had a credit card, I swiped it for 50,000 rupees. And now I'm in debt of three lakh rupees. I'm not able to pay it off. Even loan sharks offer loans only when asked. But the banks call profusely, disturb our peace of mind, and put people in debt. I paid back my loan in full. But they claim I need to pay more, as the interest rates have increased. Hey, shut up! Sir, please proceed. Yet you'd only present your cheeks. But will never return the money. Hey! Why are you looking at me? The agreement holds all the details. You're supposed to read it! Sir, they gave us an application and asked us to sign it. I signed it. I don't know what's written on the agreement. How can you hold the bank responsible if he did not read it? Why did you beat me? What's taking Harsha so long? Why do you beat me for that? If Harsha does not arrive in fifteen minutes, the agreement states I can slap you. - Please read it to him, manager. - I did not read it. How can I be held responsible for it? You should've read it before signing it. It is mentioned, sir! Take your hands off me! Hey! Idiot! Camera! What's happened to the 25,000 crores? He claimed a 40 percent loss as well! Anto sir! How do you interrogate a thief at the police station? We hit and interrogate them. Why are you so calm now? How could I interrogate the big shots? If someone steals 1,000 bucks, you beat them up! But if someone steals 25,000 crores, you fear them. - Begin, sir… - Okay, sir! Beat them up. They deserve it! Not enough! Stop! Stop! Stop! I'll confess! - Not enough! - Ask him to stop. Hurry up! We can escape them if we enter international waters. Valavan, stop the trawler and surrender. If you don't stop I'll shoot! Stop the trawler! You don't realize the gravity of the situation. I will confess! What happened to the 25,000 crores? - I incurred a loss. - How? Sir, their reps inform the customers, "Mutual Fund is market risk." before they invest money. - Really? Call a rep! - Sure, sir. Hello, this is Your Bank's Saravanan. And you? Hello, sir. My friend referred you to me. I have 2,00,000 rupees that I'd like to invest. Sure, I'll help you! A new mutual fund scheme is introduced. You can invest in it. I was told it's a risk… Which idiot told you? I stand to guarantee your money. Sir, don't ask people for ideas. They will confuse you. I'll come in person and explain. Could you please reduce your TV volume? TV volume? Why? It's echoing, sir! The bank you work for is looting people. Moron! Unaware of it, you are scouting for customers. Sir! I need to achieve the target. What can we do? How can you lie and cheat the customers? We never lied, sir. - We slightly hide the truth. That's it! - Oh, god! I should give you one… You set a target for your reps and secretly instigate them to do wrong things. See, our customers did not get cheated. They invested in our company. We invested in the share market through Sunil's brokerage company. We incurred a loss. That's it, sir. Oh, you should've chosen to invest in a genuine company. It would be best if you had chosen to invest in a genuine company! You should ask Sunil, sir. Oh, I need to ask him. Mr. Sunil, wherever you are, please come to the show. Hello! He's not in India. He's in Mauritius! I don't think so! I saw him inside the boot of a car at a nearby gas station. Okay, sir! I'm asking you for the one last time… If you don't confess, I'll kill you and throw you away in the sea. First, AC asked for the gunpowder. Later another team came and paid me three crores... - Three crores? - Yes! Two tons of RDX! An entire pin-code in Chennai will be wiped out if there's a blast. Thiru, make sure this information does not get out. The city will be in a panic. We have already checked the entire perimeter around the bank. Check all the vehicles plying on the roads connected to the bank. - Don't spare any vehicle. - Yes, sir! Everyone, get off your vehicles! Operation Your Bank Activated! Load the weapons! Come on, fast! Come on, hurry up! The weapons are on the way. Prepare a "RIP" post for the people who will die. Everything will come to an end in an hour. Except for Chairman, no one else will survive inside the bank. Next on our esteemed guest list, is Mr. Sunil. Welcome to the show, Mr. Sunil! Mr. Harsha, how did you trust and invest in a person who placed a server within the Stock Exchange and committed a fraud of millions? This scam is the latest one. - When we invested… - Was he a saint? Tell me, Sunil! Where are the 25,000 crores? Tell me, Sunil! What happened to the people's money that you invested in the share market? I invested in ten different companies, and it incurred a loss! How did ten companies go to a loss at the same time? Investments in the share market are uncertain. - Anto… - Okay, sir! I will confess! Those ten companies were shell companies that belonged to him. You're webbed and doomed, you moron! Oh! So the ten companies belonged to him? Indeed! I bought companies under loss for low prices, listed and invested in them. In two years, I projected them going under loss, and we swindled all the money. - Where is all the money? - I gave it to Krish! Where's the money? Ask him! - Where's the money, sir? - Ask him! - Where's the money? - I gave it to Krish! Where's the money? - Where's the money, sir? - Ask him! - Tell me. Where's the money? - Ask him! Where's the money? Sir, I gave it to Krish. - Anto… - Sir? Until they tell you where the money is, you keep beating them. Okay, sir! I'll tell… I'll confess… I'll confess! - Hey, shut up! - You shut up! - I can't take it anymore. - Hey! Camera… Camera! Sir, the money… is inside this bank. There's a secret locker… under the currency chest! There are 25,000 crore rupees stashed inside the locker. Commissioner, now tell me, am I here to rob the bank? Or are they robbing the public with a bank? Sir, we finished checking the traffic cams! Every time the chairman visited Chennai, a container at night plied to and fro. The chairman visited the bank eighteen times. And every time, a container followed him. The CCTV footage from the bank has been erased. That means the 25,000 crores they claim stashed inside the bank are not there anymore. The chairman emptied it all. Then why did he plan a heist? Sir, everything that has happened inside this room has gotten leaked. But Sam's confession about the chairman did not leak yet. Inspector Rajesh often met with the press… Sir, reporter Mai Pa, and Inspector Rajesh are close aides. Bring me Rajesh! Sir! - Rajesh… - Sir! Everything that happened here, was leaked to the press. Why did the news about Chairman's plan to rob the bank, not leak? I have the same doubt, sir. - Rajesh, I'm not a fool you peg me for. - I know, sir. Sir! I won't shoot. But I will push you inside the bank. Sir, please, sir! You should confess the truth. They are going to kill everyone inside the bank. Except for Chairman, they will kill everyone, and blame it on the robbers. How? He is a terrorist! He threatened and tortured us into giving a false statement. Whatever we three spoke is all a lie! The live feed is cut, sir. Start playing our news! Terrorists cut the live feed! Terrorists have captured Your Bank! The terrorists inside the bank… with the help of the Dark Devil team executed the heist! Terrorists are trying to destroy the Indian economy by giving a false narrative to the people. There goes the news blaming terrorism! They will kill them in an encounter! They are churning out lies. We should not spare them! - The bank is near Mannadi. Shall we go? - Let's go! The military has arrived! The commissioner stands suspended for failing to capture the terrorists. Without my orders, no one new can enter this premises. Take these two men and lock them up! Nothing should happen without my knowledge. Hey, release him! The robbers inside the bank are terrorists! This is a commando operation here on. All police out! We have been asked to take over. Orders! Ravindran, this is Tamil Nadu! Your antics won't work here. Arrest him! Hey! Hey, don't! Don't make it ugly! Hey, no! Don't do it, Ravindran! - Don't do this, Ravindran! - Orders, sir. Orders! Please open the secret locker, Chairman! They're all fake notes. How come all the money is fake, CEOs? I don't know! - Tell me, Chairman. - How do I know? But I know! This year the chairman visited this branch eighteen times to shift the 25,000 crores elsewhere. Where did he shift the money? Only the chairman knows the location. He planned the heist himself. After completing the heist of 500 crores, he was going to blast the chest and burn the fake notes. He planned to cheat you people and claim that 25,000 crores burned down. Am I correct, fireman? - Traitor! - Fucking cheat! What about you? Sir, they cut the live feed! Sack up all the original currencies! - Clear the area. - Move! Come on, this way! Go! Save the chairman. He has already killed Sam and Ramachandran. Start! Commandos, assemble! - Please, sir! Please, sir! - Please spare me! Just name your price! Where is the actual money? If you spare my life, I'll give up the location. Okay, tell me. I'll spare your life. - Promise me! - I swear, I'll spare you! It's on the ship I own. I hid it in 25 containers between the hundreds of containers on that ship. You can take as much money as you want from it. - But spare my life. - Close the door! Hey, you swore! You're not the only one who could cheat. - Get lost! - Please spare me! You promised! Take position! Public break out in protest supporting the bank robbers! The public refuses to agree that the robbers are terrorists. Hold your ground! Fire! Boys down! Change position! Go inside! Go! Launchers take position! Fire! Fire! Hey, watch out! Did you say two tons of RDX? Stop! Until we leave here, no one should move! If you dare move… Sir, we could not do anything. He escaped! He should not get his hands on the 25,000 crores. Don't spare him! Please understand. The vehicle is a moving bomb. CM, sir, if he escapes, it'll make a bad example. It'll be a terrible example! And we can't run our business! Once he exits the city… clear the public, and blast him along with the vehicle. Sir, the public support is strong! After he's dead, we can spin stories about him as we please. The case stands only if the living speaks! And only the living can imply history. You go ahead and follow my order! Up! The ambulance is ready. - Go! - Okay! How far is the ship that contains the money? Twenty nautical miles! Behind the harbor unloading area, there's a speedboat on a move, and it's not responding to any orders Check that boat! Kanmani! Go! Fire! Down! - Straight! - Move forward! Go! Get ready! Kill him before he enters the international waters. Go to your right! Anand, be careful! Anand, Kanmani, go! Surround! Bank robbers were shot dead. Coast guard is diligently looking for the dead bodies in the sea. Meanwhile, vital evidence regarding Your Bank has come to light. If everything had gone according to my plan, then I would have transferred the 25,000 crore rupees to five lakh fake accounts I created and turned the entire money accountable. Commandos! Help! Help! UB Krish, we have a search warrant! Stop and surrender! I could not find the body. INTERNATIONAL WATERS Hey, open it! Hey! Open them! Commissioner… won't you thank me? Not just me, the five lakh people who lost their money will thank you. But this is wrong. Please surrender! I handed the responsibility to the right person. Inform the people! Committing suicide or sulking over being cheated won't work out anymore. If you don't have the guts, you'll never achieve glory. If you are courageous Victory is ours If you are courageous Victory is ours Come on, we will strike back You are doomed Wait and watch the strike back No more conflicts Be fearless, soar high Break the shackles, be valiant Let the people stand against you I am a gangsta One who's sincere In establishing justice He's a gangsta One who stands up against injustice He's a gangsta Father who protects his daughter Is a gangsta too Even when she is angry A mother who cares Who the gangsta? A K A K - The ambulance is ready! Go! - Okay. It's impossible to go near the ship. Let's make it happen. I always thought of him as a joker. In the end, he convinced me he was a hero. Disperse! Now tell me, who the gangsta? Tell me, who the gangsta?
