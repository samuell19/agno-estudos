It is dedicated to the 30th anniversary from the victory of the Soviet peoples in the Great Patriotic War FRONT WITHOUT FLANKS Based on motifs from the documentary novel by S. K. ZVIGUN "We will be back" AUGUST 1944 The Red Army retreats to the east, fighting bloody battles with the numerous forces of the German-fascist armies. In enemy-occupied territories, Soviet people start fighting the aggressor. The fascists seek to break the will of the people with terror and betrayal. Brothers! Brothers! What are they doing? Bastards! Get ready! - As you command. To fight! Kolya, light up! Forward! DEATH OF THE FASCIST OCCUPIERS Leave, Grandpa. Can you bury them all? I cannot bury all, but I will bury him. I will remember this place... ... and when the time comes, I will tell the people, that here lies a hero - a tanker. He did not escape the Germans like some. Enough, Grandpa. Beware of your language. You are not at the market. Company Commander - Lieutenant Petrenko. Commander of what company, lieutenant? Where are your people? - Here. Line up your troops. - As you command. Comrade Major! The sixth company of the 10th regiment, line up! We have no transportation for the wounded. Comrade Commissar, I must release part of the trucks for the wounded. The dead are to be buried. And the ammunition? - To be divided among the soldiers. Execute. - As you command. Where are your weapons? Where are your weapons? - I lost it. They did not surprise us. We were not ready. - You haven't even tried to organise resistance. - And what could I do? Half of the company remained, and the regiment is... well, who knows where. Comrade Major, we were surrounded. - Enough! Comrades soldiers... They brought us weapons in a difficult hour, so that we can protect the homeland from the fascist occupiers. Some of you have lost those weapons, and by that they lost the honour of being a Red Army soldier. Think about my words and draw your conclusion. Distribute people along the lines. - As you command. And the lieutenant - in Artomov's company, as a replacement. We will see later. Is it clear? - As you command, Comrade Major. Right! Forward march! Comrade Commander... Will a rifle be found for me? And who are you, sorry? - I am a priest. Father Paul. Or simply... Pavel Ivanovich Vorobyov. I turned east, but my heart will break. I am giving up my service and please, take me as a soldier. For the willingness to take up arms, thank you Pavel Ivanovich. But weapons can be not just be the rifle. Think. To people, who are scared and confused by the war, your help will not be superfluous. The weak will need to be taken care of. The faithful - to hide from the enemy. You can help more than the rifle. Different people will knock on your door. Someone can send you a message from us too. Will you receive it? I will wait. - Good then! All the best, Comrade Vorobyov. - And I thank you. To keep you... What are you looking for son? - Probably you, Grandma. May I enter? - Here you are. Hello. - Hello. Grandsons? - The sons. Who knows where they are now. The grandsons... - The grandsons. Run to the barn. Bring the pot with milk. Take my son. Sit down! What is the boy's name? - Misha. Where are you from, dear man? As if you were a soldier? - I'm a soldier, Grandpa. A soldier. Eat son, eat! - Thank you, Grandma. Completely old. His eyes don't see any more. A sailor is a grandfather. Sailor... Let me ask you? Who are you fighting for? For whom can a Black Sea sailor fight? We are fighting for the Soviet power, Grandpa... - Eat... Good health. Did the Germans come here? - They passed through the village, but for now God does not have mercy on us. - For now... Are you going far sailor? How can I tell you... Lord, we called the devil! Germans... Germans! Lord, what will happen? Hide him mum. Soldier, enter the barn. Climb to the loft. On the loft. Where are you taking her? Our feeder! Give her back to me! Let go! - Mother, leave her. Leave the predators! They will pay us for everything. Let them take everything! She is our breadwinner! Partisan? Partisan? We do not know of any partisans. We have not seen them at all. Partisan? Where are the partisans? I will tell you where the partisans are. This is where the partisans are. We are all partisans. Disappear from our country. Go away you bastards! Run! Alive! Nice... Will you come with me? Come and let me dress you. And the coat? Where is your cap? - On the stove. Faster! Tired? - No, uncle. We will rest soon. Then we will be late. Okay, uncle. Hold on! Go forward. Stop! Hands up! Come on! Look at him, a sailor. What are you doing with a child on the mountain? Lost? - The sea is far from here. Can I put my hands down? - Wait! Semyon, search him. See! A whole arsenal. - Hands up! Now you can lower them. - Where are you going sailor? To the mountains. - We are following the same path. Hold on, cat. - What? Let's go for a walk. Come on, come on... Go! - Don't be afraid, son. Come on, come on... - Let's go Misha. Where do sailors come from? - From the Marines, we guard the artillery regiment. I replace the dead commander. I was unattached for three days, I sent two to on reconnaissance, but they did not return. I decided to go alone. Michman Vakulenchuk. Where is your platoon? - Nearby, Comrade Major. We are defending ourselves. Where did this boy with you come from? I ran into Germans in the mountains, Comrade Major. His grandparents were killed. I took the boy with me. Zina! Hello. What's your name? Misha Turchenkov. - Good then. Zina, accept the new soldier, Mikhail Turchenkov. As you command, Comrade Major. He will be my orderly. Let's go Misha. Misha, go with Dada Zina and listen to her. Do we understood each other? Goodbye. I will come soon. - Let's go. Were you on the asphalt road? - Yes, Comrade Major. German tanks go. - And left, on the black road? Infantry, transporters. Did you cut the railway line? - No, all crossings are guarded. It is impossible to get around, due to the swamp. Is the situation clear to you? - Unequivocally, Comrade Major. You will join us, Comrade Michman. We will fight together. - As you command. Do you know how to read a map? - I learned a little. What is this? - A swamp. Swamp... And this is a swamp. Do you know the only way out is it through that passage? - Yes. Like this... Tomorrow night, at 03:00, you on one side and we on the other. Will we press them? Yes, Comrade Major. Tomorrow - a meeting at the crossing. As a scout, they will go with you, the intelligence officers Bondarenko and Ivanov. Your acquaintances. Is it clear? - It's clear, Comrade Major. I'm glad that Piotr Sergeyevich is doing well. I am very glad. Allow me go. - Go. So, do you know the major? - Do we know each other? Are you a countryman? - He was a teacher in our village. School principal. - Why are you surprised that you are fighting well? Before the war, they wanted to imprison me. In a little while, I would lie down for 10 years. - Why? I was told that I wanted to set fire to the cooperative, that I spat on the Soviet government. One slandered me. Bastard! - The major, Ivan Petrovich, then became head of the regional NKVD. The file came to him. And he? - He? He was righteous. Okay. Give me back my arsenal. - Take it. I give it to you. - Thank you. Fight, machine gunner. - Mine is better. Let's go then... on foot... Do we have a connection? - No. Neither with the division, nor with the corps. What happened? I think they decided not to send forces to fight us, they simply did not go around and moved on. Their storage tanks are 30 km ahead of us. Comrade Major, the detachment is lined up. The number is 603 people. Soldiers - 580, middle age and young commanders - 23. 15 people are on guard. Wounded - 140, of them severe - 38. 412 people are from our division, and the rest - from different parts. Captain Seryogin. - Thank you, Captain. First company, attention! Second company, attention! - Third company, attention! Detach, turn by the banner! Peaceful! Left turn! At ease! This is the banner of the 315th Regiment from the 41st Infantry Division. I am the chief of the special department of the division - Major Mlinski. As the highest rank, I took command of the detachment. The Commissar of the detachment is the political Commissar Aliyev. Chief of Staff - Captain Seryogin. Friends! We are surrounded. The fascists are all around us. But we are in our own country. We are regular Red Army soldiers. We are holding weapons in our hands and for us there is not and must not be an encirclement. I can promise you neither a peaceful life nor miracles. Only by our own hands will we win. Detach! Attention! Right turn! Align with the flag! Forward march! Colonel Kempe urgently to me. What is this? - A souvenir, Herr Lieutenant General. By Standardenführer Wolf. - Interesting. Better to ensure the security of the surroundings. Enter. Herr Colonel, Do you know that the opponent acts behind our backs? My plane was shot at today and a bridge was blown up. These are small detachments that are surrounded. I'm not interested in details. Call the area commander and Standardenführer Wolf. We need to take it seriously. Remember, Kempe, the partisan wars can be stretched endlessly. Herr Lieutenant General, a Russian priest wants to come to you. What does he want? - He wants to open a church in the town. Let it open. - There is an army warehouse in it and without your order... Let him address the city commander. Herr Lieutenant General, he is trying to see you. Okay. Invite him. - As you command. I'm listening to you, father. Herr General, soldiers from your army have taken over the church. What to do. We fight without you. I came to ask you on behalf of the diocese. The murky weather sows weakness and sorrow in the souls. The church is called to appease the weak and the poor. I ask your permission for our church to start working in the spirit of her teaching. Open the church. We will deploy. I am very grateful to you. You act like a Christian. - Tell me, father... Tell me... Honestly... You are an adult. What is happening? We have come to free you from the tyranny of the Bolsheviks, but we do not receive sufficient support and sympathy from the population. What's the problem? Don't be afraid. Tell me the truth. Can a man tell the whole truth? Okay. Tell your truth. The war brought us trouble and destruction, death for thousands of people. Grief and tears moved into our homes. God sees everything! God is always on the side of the victors. But mercy, Herr General, is one of the commandments of all religions. Calmness is the basic commandment for the defeated people. Come in, darlings. Enter. Onwards, son, onwards... Enter. Hello. Who is your boss? - Hello. Are you an infantryman or a sailor? I don't recognise you. By what hierarchy do you need the main one? After the military. I have been through two wars, the civil and the German. - As soon as that is the case, let's meet. Major Mlinski. - Matvey Egorovich... Guard. While the men are in the army, I command here. Let me report, Comrade Commander. The sawmill is not working, due to the German occupation. The situation is calm. - Did Germans come, Matvey Egorovich? They did not come. There are no roads for cars. And after the "friendly", the tractors get stuck. But planes fly by, both day and night. Towards Moscow. - How do you know they are for Moscow? When they flew over us, the radio announces in the morning of an attack on Moscow. - The radio? But the night before, it stopped sending. The motor stopped working. Otherwise we listen to Radio Moscow every day. Did you listen to the news? - What else? Alyosha, my grandson, I stuck flags on the map. Can be seen. Everything is noticed. Which cities did they skip and where are they still there. Be careful! Leave it carefully. It is still completely pale. Severely wounded. Be careful. Be careful! Comrade commanders... The front has moved farther east. It is now more than 100 km away. We still have nothing to do with the army. It seems that we will have to face the opponent. We have little ammunition, little food. The ill and wounded will reduce our mobility. The Germans may start an operation tomorrow to search through the mountain. We will try to deceive them that we will move east, but in fact we will retreat in the mountain where the German will not be allowed to enter. You see that the situation is difficult, but not hopeless. I am glad that many useful opinions were expressed here. And further, our detachment is part of a unit of the regular Red Army. The detachment will fight relentlessly with the fascists. And while there is, we will fulfil the debt to the homeland to the end. Now, comrades commanders, it is necessary for you to explain this task to the soldiers. Please do not hide anything. Eh, son! How did the freaks hit you? How? I do not know. I did not fight who knows how much. You have to fight with skill. To defeat the enemy, but to stay alive and healthy. Easy to say, right? - You see how many storage tanks they have. Tanks you say. Are there no men in the armour? A living soul. So he knows about fear too. You should shoot at him, not be afraid. We no longer have the strength. - What now? Do you know how we chose the Germans in the First World War? That's how we hit them, that their heels burned. - And from us fascists they did not run away immediately like a wick mare, which smokes in a delicate place. Because that wick is very short in your country, it does not pull. The interior should also burn. To Berlin! - Something is developing, Grandpa. What a miracle that is? - Schmeiser, Grandpa. Automatic. I have not seen such when I fought. Will you teach me to look for him? - To "teach" you, but the automation is complex. Grandpa, sit on the stove and sip semolina. Can I eat semolina porridge and lie on the stove, am I alive; everything would be fine if people like you did not run away from the Swabians. I'm not lazy. Science is still useful to me, not like you. - But the grandfather has a tongue! Don't shave like a razor. - Our long beard will not grow. Okay, I'm giving up. Will you treat tobacco? I will honour you. We can cross the front line only under one condition. If there is a cross attack. - It is possible, if they don't wait. Do we need a connection? Who to send? I have two in mind. - Who? Soldiers Bondarenko and Ivanov. Bondarenko proved good in the fight. Destroy a tank. Brave boy. Easily navigates to an unknown area. Especially in the mountains. Ivanov is older, calmer. I have known him since the beginning of the war. An experienced intelligence officer. Good couple. - Isn't Ivanov the one, who you were talking about, Ivan Petrovich? Do you doubt now, Commissar? - The work is very responsible. I know Ivanov. I believed him immediately and I was not wrong. Send them to me. I will talk to them before teasing. And prepare another couple to make sure. Let me help you, Zinochka. Look what an evening it is. Are we going for a walk today? When to take a walk? - War is war, and life flows, Zinochka. Let's take a walk, huh? - No lieutenant. I don't have time. I do not have today, and I will not have tomorrow... - You are a good girl, Zina, I just feel sorry for you. - And what do you have to pity me? I don't know how to help the wounded. I am not a doctor. The wounded, the wounded... And for yourself? Better to leave them here. If we drag them down the mountain with us, we will only kill them. If they push us from the flanks, we will have to leave the burden, we will not carry them on our hands. - Quieter! What if the Germans come? - How many did you bury today? What can I do? Today I let four people return to the line-up. They asked for it themselves, and they are still quite weak. Zina... What are you doing? Aren't you crazy? Are these the Germans? - And if not? Hello! Hello... Hello! - I'm listening to you. Here is the military command. Who's on the phone? The guard. - Is there a Russian soldier? Is there a Russian soldier? Hello! Hello! Here is the military command. A Russian soldier... is there? Russian... You should have said that there is no one. We need to escape. - Go to Mlinski, warn him. Why Mlinski? You cannot escape with the whole village. What kind of army are we? Zina, let's escape together. We will slip through a path. - What are you talking about? Run fast to the major. You will die, Zina! And together we will slip. I will help you. If they don't catch me, I will think of something to say to them. We will take off the uniforms and say that we are a man and a woman. Decide or it will be too late. - You are a coward, lieutenant! That's not nice, lieutenant. Why are you attacking our sister? What are you talking about brothers? Don't do that. We're just joking. - I will joke with you too. Do not approach! - Don't you dare, you bastard! Go to hell with them, you idiot! Stop! Who's coming? Petrenko... - What happened? Petrenko suggested we run away together and he ran away. He can lead the Germans. We have to kill him. Hands up! Russian pig. - I am... Don't! I am... I am a friend. No need. I'm your friend. Don't! Get up! - Don't! Don't, don't... Don't! The bastard ran away! I knew about that Petrenko. I knew he was bad. But that he is a traitor... Michman, set up a double guard. As you command. - Heck. What kind of mother gave birth to him? Now we have to withdraw. Without me you will not cross the swamp in front of the mountain. Take me with you. I will be useful to you. Now we do not have to go to the mountains, Matvey Egorovich. Ivan Petrovich, about 25 piads from here there was a camp in the mountain. Geologists were looking for something before the war. Three small ruins remained there. The place is fenced. Where is that, Matvey Egorovich? I will take you there. Not far from here. You can always come here. For food or something else. Can we pass with the wounded? - We will pass. Will your people come with us? - Why are you? They are just a burden on the military. They will certainly not fight with women and children. I will leave Alyoska here. All kinds of people fall from the planes. He will let us know if needed. He knows all the paths around. Leave your boyfriend with us. Why bother with hills and swamps? Okay. We leave in two hours. Mouse, it's time. Goodbye. We will be back soon. Let's go, hero. Thank you dear women. - Thank you. Why all of a sudden? - Don't cry, mother. God! - We will be back. Son, dear... God! What should we do? I collected some things. Don't catch a cold, Matvey Egorovich. I packed your warm socks. Alyosha, you will stay here as a man. In case of need, you know where I will be. - Good. Beware, Matthew Egorovich. - All right, Anastasia. Well, women, all the best. - Goodbye, Matvey Egorovich. Soldier, Herr Officer. When I first got out of the hoop at Minsk, I said I was a lieutenant and I thought that would make it easier for me to be in captivity. Then a colonel saw my stars and appointed me commander of a company. What task did you go to the city with? - I have no task. I have my own clearing accounts with the Soviet government. They took my father's land. They ruined our family. You have already said that. You say the same thing, that Major Mlinski's detachment is located in the village by the mountain. - That's right! The intelligence concluded that there was no army there. They were not found in the mountains either. - When I left, they were there. They must have gone to the front line. Are you sure they went to the front line? Why would they go the other way, as they made their way east. You are lying Petrenko! - I surrendered myself. Voluntarily. I will believe you in action. - Thank you. At the slightest suspicion, you will hang on a gallows. Do not doubt, Officer. - For now, go. As you command. Herr Officer. - What else? I remembered a conversation. Major Mlinski was born in the Smolensk region. He lived there with his family before the war. I do not remember where. Your army is there now. You can certainly find his family if they did not flee somewhere. - You remember where? I will remember. I will surely remember! You will undermine all approaches from that side. As you command, Comrade Major. Block, so as not to crumble. - Understood, Comrade Commander. Embankment higher. Block. What is the visibility? - She is normal, Comrade Commander. Spread the plane. Be patient! Be patient a little more. Wear it faster. Artemich, listen to me. When you're done here, cross the stable. - Hasan Aliyevich. Continue. - How are things with you? Will you finish by morning? - Yes. I think I will finish. Everyone should hurry. - Comrade Major. We undermined the approaches. - Warn everyone to be careful. Did you patch the flag? - We are finishing. Ivan Petrovich, the boys returned from distant intelligence. They did not find the partisans. They say the Germans bombed the mountain east of the village. When? - Three days ago. That is Petrenko. - It is his work. There is no one else. - Heck! Here's what, Captain. Take Grandpa Matthew with the intelligence and go immediately to the village by the mountain. People there may need our help. As you command, Comrade Major. Misha and I were in the mountains. We came back - everything was on fire. There is no one. We started looking for them, and they are all here. Everyone is here - in the well. How so? Those women... and the children? We for all this... We will take revenge on them for everything. They have to pay with blood, with their own death. We will cross... here. The Germans go to sleep. Semyon, what day is it today? - From the birth of Christ? From Mlinski. - Have already passed 18. And we have been crawling on the front line for two days. The control period has passed. What will Ivan Petrovich think of us? And Semyon? What to do? We passed 200 piads. This is where the front has moved. Moscow is quite close. Certainly not declared dead. And if... We should not kill Semyon. We will cross. Will we be late? - Perhaps? It will be easier for us to pass. Vitamins. Are you ready? - I'm ready. Let's go. Quiet! We will not pass either. Crawl! I will distract them. Take it. You go. Go... Go! Perform the task. Come on, Peter. You should not die. Goodbye. Comrades, Moscow is under siege. The party is urging Muscovites to prepare for defence. The situation is very serious. According to the testimonies of the front intelligence in the direction of your army, von Horn spam "tank attack". In such circumstances, the front headquarters considers it necessary to start, through communications in a hostile background, intelligence and sabotage activity. It is important to know exactly when and in what part von Horn plans the offensive. We need to stop or slow down the transfer of his armies until the beginning of our offensive. We need to use them for that the remains of besieged military units, located in the rear of von Horn's army. We need to connect with them immediately and to be given a task, not to break through the front line, but there, on the spot, to destroy German communications. If it is done broadly enough, they will be forced to use in their background military reserves or even withdraw part of the front units. What will the intelligence chief say? In the background of von Horn's army are transferred several intelligence groups. In the mountains east of the city, where the headquarters is located, is the detachment of Major Mlinski. And who is Major Mlinski? Chief of the Special Department of the 41st Infantry Division. They have been fighting the siege since August, near Smolensk. How many people are in the detachment? - Across the front line passed his soldier - a scout. A month ago there were about 600. People from other units are probably joining him. The detachment may have increased. According to our data the detachment continues with active actions. Do we have anything to do with them? - We asked the illegal city committee to establish a connection. We are preparing a radio operator for switching. Special attention is needed for Major Mlinski's detachment. It is very important. - At the headquarters of von Horn we have a source of information. Now a relationship with him is maintained through the intelligence group of Captain Afanasiev. Hurry up, Comrade Colonel. Make a connection with the detachment of Major Mlinski. - As you command, comrade member of the Frontier Military Council. Stop! Stop! - Stop! Partisan? I am a craftsman. I am a carpenter. The tool is really carpentry. Okay. What? Try it. What's inside? - Home-made brandy. Schnapps. - A schnapps? Okay. And bacon. Take it. Drink! - Faster! God forbid it's not my last. She is good. Thank you. Here you are. - Let me go. Mr. Chief, I need to go to town. To earn something. - Release him Herr Feldwebel. What to do with it? He will soon break the strings himself. Okay, come on. - Go, old man. But beware, if something is wrong, you will not be forgiven. Yes, yes... - You can not doubt. Stop! Stop! Give me the ax. You can not with her. - What kind of carpenter will I be then? You were told you could not. Now go with health. Are you Matvey Egorovich? What brought you to us? Here I come. I decided to see you. We are relatives. Welcome, unexpected guest. Take of your coat, Matthew Egorovich. Where is your Evdokia? And the children? I'm alone. They have been evacuated. Is Dada Anastasia alive and well? Anastasia is no more. Light and earthy. From what? The Germans killed her. - Where? In the mountain village. I have only Gjosha left - my grandson. - But bad! And you were left alone? - I'm alone. I came back and did not find anyone, and then the Germans came. I had to stay. - So you stayed. What? You don't believe me? Zachary, you are lying badly. If you do not believe me, tell me. And you don't take me by the knife. It's hard enough for me. Why did you come? In memory of my Nastasia. Well, as soon as it is to be remembered... Then in memory of Dada Anastasia. - Come on first to cleanse the Russian lands of the fascist occupier. And then in memory of Anastasia. That's fine - this is not a bad thing at all. You know what, Zahar. Have you heard anything about the partisans? Look at Grandpa Matthew, where he's spinning! You are very cunning... Tell me, will the trains be blown up by them? The trains, Zahar, we watched. And who are "we"? You are old for such deeds. Old or not, I do not put my feet in the fascist trough. And who are "we", Grandpa Matthew? Come on, to commemorate my Nastya. Yes... Looks like Grandpa Matthew, that we are sitting in the same boat, rowing on different sides. You Zahar, sit properly and it will be easier for you to row. Hello. - Hello. Nikolai Sergeevich - Secretary of the city committee. You came to us last spring in the village. I recognised you grandfather. I recognised you. Hello. What are you bringing us? I come from Major Mlinski. His detachment is in the mountains. They are looking for a connection with you to fight together against the Germans. Grandpa is sitting. Thank you, Matvey Egorovich. I have been looking for you for a long time. You can not even imagine what joy it brought us, what work have you done. Show where it is? - Here. In the area near Svjate. About 100 km from us. Three passed. No less. Are those your assumptions or the army? What assumptions. I crawled on my stomach for two days. Army fuel depot. - Are there any trenches? There are trenches only on the side of the mountain. But there are machine gun nests here. - How many. Five, but if we walk slowly, we may reach the wire fence. What is on the side of the road and the lake? Here. On the side of the road - bunkers. That side is strongly defended. - How many people protect them? No less than company and armoured personnel carriers. Do they set up a guard? - Yes. And what do we decide? Will we make fireworks? What happened to him? And to be sleepy, the grip must be correct. - I ate little. Be careful, Saska! In that world you will not have to eat. Okay. - Take the German machine gun. Don't forget the helmet. Fasten it! Sasha, stand up. Pick up the cones, Andrjusha. Move your helmets forward. Swabians! I repeat, the most important thing is the guard at the entrance and the bunkers. The tankers are ours. Ivan, command. Right! Forward march! Password! Stop! Fire! Hence. To the tankers. Faster! We are retiring, Zina! - As you command, Comrade Major. Comrade Major, the second company withdrew. Losses: three killed, 12 wounded. - Go to the base. Zosimov - Semyon. Quickly to Commissar Valiev. Withdraw. As you command, Comrade Major. The Vakulenchuk water line receded. - All right, go to the river. What is happening to you? - Everything is fine, Comrade Major. What? - End! It's over. Did everyone walk away? - I checked myself. We will blow it up. - Let me, Comrade Major. Come on, Captain. This is for your mountain village! What did you say? I have Russian armies in the background and I don't know anything? That's amazing! You are responsible for security in the surroundings, Standardenführer Wolf. The diversion was carried out by a large detachment of the regular Russian army. We are taking urgent measures, but I cannot destroy them on my own. Please give me a regiment. - What is that detachment? About 800 people. They are commanded by a major. His last name is Mlinski. - Do you know his last name? Of the hundreds of majors in my army, I do not know more than 10. And I want to meet that major in person. What was his last name like? Mill. I want to see him alive or dead before the offensive begins. END OF THE FIRST PART
