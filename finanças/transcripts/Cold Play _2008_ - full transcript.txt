(ominous music) - I've told you already, Angus Stewart murdered my wife. I went to Rome on a business trip, when I got home this evening, I found our master bath covered in her blood. The bastard took my dagger, he went upstairs and he drove the dagger into her while she was taking a hot bath. And he took the body, my painting, my Imperial egg and he loaded it into his car, he must have dumped the body before he got home, that's when you found him. The video proves he was the last one to see her alive, you have the dagger, my painting, a one-way ticket to leave the country under a false name, her blood is on the artwork and God knows where he hid the egg. The bastard killed my wife and stole my egg and I swear, he's gonna pay for it. - You still think I did it? I told you what happened, he's a cold-hearted jealous psychopath, he threatened to kill her, when he found out about us, he lost it. It's true, I was with her earlier this evening, but when he came home and found the video that's what would have pushed him over the edge. He grabbed the carving knife, he went upstairs to the bathroom to kill her, she coughed up my address before he slit her throat, he could have ditch the body anywhere, he loaded up the car with the painting and he planted it at my place while I was at Aqua. I was having a beer, you can check with the bartender. He killed his wife in a crime of passion, and know, he's going to kill me, don't you see it? - [Auctioneer] The last and final item on tonight's docket, is the incomparable Imperial egg. (gentle music) (water splashing) The eggs were designed primarily at the behest of Russian Czars, Alexander III and Nicholas II, as annual Easter gifts for Serena's Maria and Alexandra. (metal clanking) One of the most glittering examples of these Easter eggs is the incredible Imperial egg. - Don't wear those Indigo, you look whorish. - What are you paying for exactly, you may ask? Why, the very vision and genius of the House of Fontainebleau. (car door shuts) (car engine starts) Two Impressive eggs, presented to the Dowager Empress, Maria Fedorovna, the Imperial egg of 1913 and the Grisaille of 1914, may best represent the height of Fontainebleau's career, expressions in miniature of a life of royal privilege. As you can see, the Imperial egg is an exquisite example of the opulence that Russian royalty was accustomed to living with prior to the revolution. Tonight, the bidding will begin at a modest price of $10 million U.S. (indistinct chatters) Am I bid 10 million please? Do I have 10 million, I have $10 million, thank you very much sir, am I bid 11?

May I have 16 million, I have 16 million, thank you very much sir. The bid is 16 million, do I hear 17? May I have 17 million please, 17?

That's a Latin, dear. - Thank You Natalie, we certainly did. - Was there ever any doubt? (laughing) - What do you think, Rupert? - Well, (speaks in foreign language). - You only live once. - Listen, you two have a great night and bravo. - See you at the club. - The Imperial egg, congratulations. - Thank you. - It is one of a kind. - Yes, she truly is and she's mine. - And that piece you sold me was way overpriced, my insurance were only covered for half the amount I paid, but I imagine you knew that. - Caveat emptor. - How about some champagne for the occasion? - That sounds lovely. - No thank you, we're leaving. - Goodnight Santiago. - 20 million, bold move you two. I wonder, the egg was yours before we could even collect our thoughts, absolutely brilliant, was that your idea, Indigo? - Unless you know my wife much better than I do, I'd say you're being way too generous. - Indigo, well done. (water trickling) - To Winston Thorpe, a man who knows what he wants and he will stop at nothing to get it. - I don't know what's going on between you and Santiago or whatever it is, I want it to end. - There's nothing going on between me and Sa-- - You know what I said. (ominous music) (water trickling) - Oh God, Winston you scared me. - It's 2:30 in the morning, who could you possibly be talking to at 2:30 in the morning? - I'm checking my messages, Jessica called, she said we're on for the club tomorrow. What, you don't believe me? Here, check the caller ID, I'm going to bed. (hoe thumping) Rafael. - Lemonade? He can drink from the hose. - It's hot out there, he's been digging that koi pond for-- - He's the help. Where'er you going? - I'm going to the club to meet Jessica. - Where's your gear bag? - I'm getting a massage. (phone ringing) Hey, I'm running a little bit late, probably about half an hour, okay, bye. - Who's that? - Jessica. - Jessica, hi, Winston Thorpe, Indigo is running a bit late, cheers. - Winston, you kill me. May I go now? (deep exhale) - Bastard. - I'm sorry, but it's better to know. - Is it? - Now, about me money. (door knocking) - Hello Angus. - Nigel. - You still owe us 50,000. Do you think we were too stupid to find you, you stupid fuck? - I've got some money, inside pocket, it's 10 grand. - Where's the rest? - It's coming at you, I swear. (grunting) - Two weeks, next time I'll take the interest by cutting fingers off your fucking hand. (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Winston] Is this Angus Stewart? - Who wants to know? - His name is Santiago Valdez, he's an Argentine, he owns a polo team. - And you believe he's shagging your wife. - I'm absolutely positive, I just need the proof. - Well that's a problem, I'm a wee bit busy. - Look, I'll pay you $1000 a day, starting right now. - Plus expenses. - Done. - Oh, look at that, my schedule just opened up. - I'm going to New York, I'll be back in three days. - Doesn't work like that, these things take time, just so you know. - I know she's having an affair, I just need the proof, I'll take it from there, she belongs to me, am I clear? - Absolutely. What do you do when you get the proof? - I'm gonna pay you $1 million to kill the bastard. - Look, I'm not a murderer. - You can dispense with the histrionics, you don't think I would know everything about a person I'd hire to tail my wife? I know about your past Benjamin Bright, I know all about you. - I'm sorry, I'm out of the killing business. You have to find someone else for that. - I see. Well, we'll cross that bridge. (indistinct chatter) (upbeat music) (camera shutters) (indistinct chatters) (camera shutters) - Do to have a light? You're a photographer. - Dog-walker. - Business or pleasure? - A little of both. - Well, which is it, why you've been taking pictures of me all day? Don't get me wrong, I mean, I like the attention. My husband hired you, he thinks I'm having an affair. - Are you? - Santiago, I think his boyfriend might object. - He's a puff? - He's my friend, he appreciates me because of how I think. - Your husband thinks you're having an affair. - My husband is a jealous man, he's controlling, he's possessive, he believes what he wants to believe. And you are? - Angus. - Well Angus, I'm gonna go home, alone, work out, you plan on following me? - It's my job. - I'm gonna swim in my pool, naked, then slip into bed. - So, you're giving me the night off, in case I don't feel like following you? - I'm giving you the highlights, in case you do. Good night Angus. (water trickling) (water splashing) Aren't you gonna take pictures? - Not quite sure what I'm doing here. - Your job. So tell me about yourself Angus. - Not much to tell really. - Interesting tattoo. - I'm not proud of it, but in prison sometimes you have to take sides. It was a mistake. - What were you in prison for? - I killed someone. - You killed a man? - What makes you think it was a man? - You killed a woman? - I'm not saying that. - What are you saying? - When you kill someone, better make sure that no one finds the body. So, why does your husband think you're having an affair? - I told you, my husband is obsessive, myopic, his jealousy is insidious. - So you married him for the money? - I'm not saying that. - What are you saying? - It was a mistake. - Poor pussycat, you don't love him but you'll spend his millions and shag him to keep him happy. - I'm not proud of it, but in prison sometimes you have to take sides. I'm turning in, good night Angus. - Goodnight Mrs. Thorpe. - What'd you do with the body? - How was your trip? - You're late, my time is valuable, what have you got? - I knew it. - Maybe they're just friends. - Are you an imbecile? It's obvious, they're sleeping together. - Maybe you're right, he was quite the romeo. - Where did they go after dinner? - Dancing, he took her to a club. - Where are the photos? - No cameras allowed. - What were they doing in there? - I believe it was the tango. - He's a dead man. - He wasn't the only one she danced with. - This isn't what I'm paying you for, I want proof. - I told you, you have to be patient, these things can take time. - I'll take it under advisement. (water trickling) - How about the black ones? - You're not thinking again, you can't see them. - Okay, the white ones. - Boring Indigo, think. - The gold ones then? - No, these are koi fish not goldfish, they're unique, they're fragile, they require love and attention. - They're only fish, Winston. You're hurting me. - I'm your husband, think about what you're doing. (car engine humming) (car door thumping) - What are you doing, he could be watching. - I'm not having an affair. - I don't care, I get paid to follow you. - I'm gonna go see someone about some fish, it's about a two-hour drive, we can go together. - Some professional Mrs. Thorpe. - Call me Indigo. - Look, as long as I'm on this job, I'll call you Mrs. Thorpe. And Mrs. Thorpe, this isn't a date, now get back in your bloody car. - Fine. (car engine starting) (birds chirping) (camera shutters) (water trickling) (keypad dialing) - The keypad is ready Mr. Thorpe. You need to type in a six-digit password. (keypad dialing) Now hit Enter. - Same code deactivates? - Yes, no mistakes when you enter the code, one wrong number, you have half of Westcom Security on the doorstep. - I want all of them. (water trickling) (camera shutters) (phone ringing) - Anything to report? - Not yet, but I have a lead on some other ones for tomorrow. - Fine, where are you? - I'm at dinner. - I will see you tomorrow then. (phone ringing) - Yeah. - Where is she? - She's having dinner. - Is she alone, is she alone? - No, she's with some bloke. - Santiago? - Just some bloke. - Stay close. - It's my job. What are you doing? - What, I don't like eating alone. - Well, you can't stay here, I'm on the job, your husband's expecting pictures. - Oh right, grab your camera. (camera shutters) There're your pictures. - You're unbelievable. - What are you doing? - I can't be seen with you, I don't care if you're not having an affair, this job is really important to me, I need the money. - Indigo, it is you. What brings you up here? - Oh, just doing some shopping. - Rupert Harrington, Harrington Galleries. This is my wife Natalie and you are? - This is Jeremy, he's our koi broker, Winston I are building a pond. - Oh, Japanese or domestic? - Japanese. - Don't you find that a bit cruel? - How's that? - The unattractive Japanese koi are killed when they're babies, they continue to decimate the ugly ones until only the most beautiful are left. - Sounds like Nazi Germany. Ow, sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean (clears throat). What I meant was-- - No offense taken, they're fucking fish, not people. - Do give Winston our best and also I have few new pieces he maybe interested in. - Great. - It was nice to meet you. - Jeremy. That was a mistake. - Relax, they're acquaintances from the club, you have nothing to worry about. - We're seen having dinner with my client's wife. - No, I was having dinner with my koi broker. - I don't like it, I'm lying to my client. - Your client is a monster. - He thinks you're having an affair, I can't blame him. - He grabbed me, he hurts me. - It's not my problem. - You're right, why should you care? - Why don't you just leave him? - Leave Winston? That could never happen. You don't know Winston, you have no idea what he's capable of. - You could leave the country. - He'd come after me. - That's not what I mean. - What do you mean? - You could disappear. - Disappear, how? - You've got money, you could change your identity, fake passports, new credentials, a whole new life. - That's a nice thought, I would have no idea how to do that. - Chin up pussycat, it's not the end of the world. - I like you, Angus, you're a good soul. So I guess it's good night then. - It is what it is. - I'll be at the spa morning, maybe we could have lunch, say noon? Good, see you then. (gentle music) (upbeat music) (camera shutters) (camera shutters) (water trickling) - So, how was the spa? - I didn't go to the spa. - No? - I thought about what you said last night, about leaving Winston and I think you're right. If I did leave him I would have to just disappear. - And so? - I met with an old friend of mine, he used to play on the world tennis circuit, dual citizenship, traveled around a lot. I asked him if he could help me with a passport. - Can he? - He thinks he can, it'll take a little time. - Do you trust him? - He's an ex lover. - Ex lovers can't be trusted. - He wanted to marry me, we stayed friends. - Did he mention the price? - 15,000. (whistles) - That's a bit pricey, what would you live on? - I have some things, jewelry, I could sell it, I figured, I don't know, 200,000 worth. Oh my God, you're gonna tell Winston. - Hey, wait a minute. I'm not a bloody rat, I'm on your side, I'm just saying, fair passports, I mean, they've got to be perfect or you go to real prison. - So you know about this stuff? - A bit. - You could help me - I could meet with these people, make sure you don't get hurt. - So I can trust you? - I'll do what I can. - Thank you. - Who's this? - She met him at the Tennis Club for breakfast. - Who's this? - Met the day of the restaurant. - And who the hell is this? - The bloke she was having dinner with. - She met him about some fish. - Fish, the koi broker. This isn't making any sense, where the hell's Santiago? - Maybe you're wrong about Santiago. - The koi broker. (upbeat dramatic music) (water trickling) - Gracias. - You're welcome. (car engine growling) - Koi broker, koi pond, I didn't want any koi fish in the first place. Stupid koi pond. - Mr. Thorpe, it's okay I do it. Mr. Thorpe, it's okay I do it. - Look, we need a hole here, with concrete, water, filtration, rebar, what, do I've to do it myself? - No no no, I do it. - Then do it. (water trickling) - He's just a boy. - He's an employee. - You know, I don't know why you're getting so upset. the koi fish won't be here for another three weeks, he'll have plenty of t-- - The fish, why don't you tell me a little bit more about your little visit with the koi broker. - The koi broker, Fumi, what about her? - Her? Don't you lie to me, you think I'm stupid? I know you're up to something. - What did I do? What did I do, just tell me. - I've given you everything and I'm still not enough for you, why can't you just love me? - You're scaring me, can't you see that? Look at you, this isn't love. - Love, I'd kill for you Indigo and I promise if I can't have you, no one can. I have a flight to catch. (car engine growls) - Are you all right? The fish? - I mentioned Fumi, the koi broker and he just lost it. - The photograph. - You mean the guy at the restaurant? This is insane, I mean, he throttled me on the bed, I swear I thought he was gonna kill me. - Then he really is mad. - Angus, I'm afraid. (ominous music) - You need to disappear sooner than later. - I'm gonna call Ivan right now. - I need to use the loo. - He said he'll set up a meeting for this week. - Wow, the Imperial egg. - He cares more about that egg than he does about me. - Then you should take it. - You're serious? - What did you pay for it, 10 million? - 20. - That you could live on. - I wouldn't know how to sell it. - I can move it in New York in a minute. What? - What if you came with me? - Say that again. - What if you came with me, we could take the egg, we could disappear together. - What's my cut? - I'll give you half. - Well, then we should see this fucker about some passports. Indigo. So what's the code? - He hasn't told me yet, it's probably his birthday, April 2055. - 04 20 55, if you're wrong you'll set off the alarm. This whole place will be crawling with police, you're willing to take that risk? - We have to be willing to take all sorts of risks. - So you'll test it then? - These are uncharted waters, we'll be testing a lot of things. - What is this Indigo? - It is what it is. Are these yours? - My grand dads, First World War. - I can't see what they say. - It's not what they say, it's what they mean. (metal clanking) So what does an ex tennis pro know about fake passports? - Well, it's not Ivan, he's got a guy downtown for us to meet. - Hey, wait a minute, you said trust this tennis guy but don't know the hell this other guy is. - Happens as we can trust him. - Homeland Securities, U.S. customs, immigration these are federal crimes, the government's already working overtime to fight terrorists, if we get caught, you will have a line of the best lawyers in the world, I'll go right back to prison. - Then we'll have to be careful. (phone ringing) - [Winston] Indigo, the gate is stuck again, I thought you had this thing fixed. - Sorry sweetie, I'll buzz you in, shit. (upbeat dramatic music) - [Winston] Indigo. - [Indigo] I'm upstairs. You're home early. - They didn't have the piece I wanted. You're all flushed. - Yeah, I was just working out, I'm gonna go for a swim. - Why is the door open? - I was hot, I need some air. - So what did you do last night? - Watched a movie. - Which one? - One on TV. I'm going for a swim now. - Which one? - What? - Which movie were you watching on TV last night? - "It's a Wonderful Life." Winston, what's your problem? (metal clanking) - When I came home this morning, I saw your car parked out front but I didn't see you in it. - It's got decent radio, but the toilet's for shit, was having a piss. - Or maybe you were fucking my wife. - Well, that's right, you're paying me good money to get you the proof that she's having an affair, so I get you the photos and there's no hard evidence, so it must be me, that's right, every time you leave town I'm shagging your wife, like that makes a lot of sense. - Then how the hell did these get in my bedroom? - I don't know, I must have left them by the pool. - What? - She went to the movies yesterday, alone and I had some time to kill, so I waited for her at the house, it was hotter than hell in my car, so I took a swim. - You swam in my pool? - I was back in my car long before she returned, she never saw me, but I left the tags by the pool. - Then how'd they get in my bedroom? - I don't know, do you have a maid or helper? Or maybe your wife found them. Now, if we're done with the interrogation, can I get back to my job? - Just so we're clear, if you ever did, I'll kill you. - I'll take it under advisement. (water trickling) Come one Indie, pick up. - Hi, this is Indigo Thorpe, please leave a message and I'll get back to you. (water trickling) Your home. - I need to ask you something. - Of course dear. - I found something in our bedroom this morning, something that concerns me. - What is it? - You think very carefully about your answer. (phone ringing) - Hello. - He found my dog tags, I told him I left them by the pool and then someone must have taken them to the bedroom. - Wonderful, that's good to know. After three, that'll be perfect, I'll pick it up then, thank you. Now, what's the big secret? - I found some dog tags in our bedroom. - Oh, I found them out here by the pool, I think they're Rafael's, I'll see that he gets them back. - Raphael's? - Who else? - I'll give them back to Raphael. - Fine. - There's something else. - What is it dear? - Why were there two cups of coffee on this table when I came home this morning? - What? - I said, why were there two cups of coffee on this table when I came home this morning? - I made Raphael a cup. - Today's Rafael's day off. - He was here at sunrise, after you screamed at him yesterday, he felt badly about the pond, so I told me not to worry about it and sent him home. What are you driving at? - Who was that on the phone? - The cleaners, my dress will be ready for pickup at 3:00. - And you won't mind if I take a look. - Winston Thorpe, this has got to stop, listen to yourself, the door is open, what movie did you watch, there's two coffee cups, who's on the phone. This is the problem, your jealousy is destroying our marriage and you wanna know why I can't love you? Go ahead, check the number, just keep tearing this marriage apart. - I want you to love me. - Thank you, you have to trust me Winston or this will never work. - I can't believe I left the fucking dog tags in the bedroom. - If you hadn't called. - But I did call. Do you think he knows? - No, I told him the dog tags belong to the pool boy. - Good, that's good thinking. - He also found the coffee cups from this morning. - Oh shit, we can't be this careless. - Angus, if he finds out, I'm scared. - We stay on track, we get the passports, we grab the egg and we disappear. - That's it, that's the tattoo place. - You ready to disappear? - What's the matter? - Close the door. - What? - Just close the door. - What's going on? - Don't move. - That guy's got your tattoo, who is that? - I can't go in there. - Well, I have to go in there. - Not now. - Look, I owe some people some money, they're not the kind of people that will like it if I'm trying to leave the country. All right, we're clear. - Raphael, what the hell are you doing inside of the house, you know the rules, what are you doing here, it's your day off. - (speaking in foreign language) - Speak English. - I come for my money. - Payday is next Friday, period. (speaking in foreign language) - Raphael wait. Were you here this morning. - No sir. - You didn't ask Mrs. Thorpe for a cup of coffee. - No senior. - I need to ask an important question Rafael, I need you to tell me the truth. - Si senior. - Has anyone been here at the house with Mrs. Thorpe while I've been away? Just tell me, I won't be mad at you. Has anyone been here? - Si senior. - Is this the man? - No senior. - What about this man? - No sir. - Could it be this man? - Possible. - Thank you Rafael. - $30,000 for a couple of photos and we still got to wait a week for our passports, bollocks. - Look, the fake IDs will work for now, we can at least get our plane tickets, were on track. (car engine starting) (ominous music) - Here's your ticket, passports will be ready the day we leave. - You still need to test the code. - I told you, I think it's his birthday. - You think, what, are you duff, we need to know for sure, you have to test it. - When? If I'm wrong about the code, we trigger the alarm, the police are involved Winston finds out. - It's your husband. It's okay. Yeah, I'm on my way. He wants to meet with me. - When I came home this morning, I found two cups of coffee on the patio table, I confronted Indigo and she said it was for Rafael, she said he came by this morning to work on the koi pond, one problem, today's Rafael's day off. He came by this afternoon to pick up a check, I asked him point-blank, he didn't know a thing about the coffee but he did say he saw someone at the house with Indigo yesterday. - So what are you saying? - You know what I'm saying. - And you think it's? - Who else could it be? - Then you know. - Yes, it's the koi broker, truly you must have seen him. - If she brought him back to the house, she must have hid him in the car, I've never seen anyone. - That's him, that's the bastard. - You're right, now we've got to nail him, this is how it works, you need to leave town for a few days, I'll stick out the grounds, when the bastard takes it to the bedroom, I'll get you the proof you need. - I could go to Rome. - The sooner the better. - Thank you. - Just doing my job. You're gonna take him out? - I'm a very thorough man, I don't take action until the evidence is irrefutable. - He thinks it's the koi broker? - I was shitting bricks. - And he's going to Rome, this is too easy. - We're not out of the woods, we still need the passport and the egg. - What is it? - Business, I may have a buyer. - Winston. - Hello Rupert, long time no see. - I trust Indigo gave you our regards. - I'm sorry. - We ran into her last week in Santa Barbara, she was having dinner with your koi broker. - You met the koi broker? - Says you're going with the Japanese ones. You know, we're thinking about getting some koi ourself, Natalie prefers the domestic, would you recommend him? - No, no I wouldn't. - All the same, could I get his number, Natalie loves the Scottish accent. - Scottish accent? - His accent, my wife likes it, the tattoo's a little off-putting. (water trickling) - How do you feel? - A little dizzy. - That should do it. - Thank You, Winston should be home any minute. - Should I come inside? - You know the rules. - What the hell are you doing back inside my house? - What's going on? - This doesn't concern you Indigo, Rafael, answer me? - I come for my money senior. - Rafael, I told you Winston would be home any minute. - I thought-- - It doesn't matter what you thought, this is now the second time I've seen you sneaking around this house. - Winston, he wasn't sneaking, it was a misunderstanding. - I told you this doesn't concern you. - Your services are no longer required Rafael, comprende? - You're firing him? - You're damn right, adios Rafael, I'll send you your final payment. - So that's it? Fine, adios Mr. Thorpe, Mrs. Thorpe. - Did you have to fire him? - Shut up, he knew the rules. I bought a painting in San Diego La Jolla galleries, I need you to pick it up. - I'll do it first thing in the morning. - I leave for Rome tomorrow, I want the painting here before I leave. - Right now I'll never make it. - Get a hotel then, then pick it up first thing in the morning. (feet stomping) - I think he's on to us. - That's impossible. - How do you know? - I told you, he thinks it's the koi broker, he bloody thanked me. - Then why is he sending me to San Diego? - Is he still going to Rome? - Tomorrow. - Then we're right on track, I'm telling you, it's perfect. - Angus I'm scared. - Don't cry pussycat, we'll get the egg, we'll catch our flight and we'll be gone. - La Jolla, the traffic's gonna be terrible. - We'll grab a drink, kill some time. - I wanna go to your place. - I know it's a bit of a shit hole. - No no, it has a certain charm, you're right, it's a shit hole. - I don't know, a little bit of paint, maybe some curtains. (drill buzzing) - It's a wireless fiber optic lens, latest technology, CIA kind of stuff. - What happened, the screen has gone black. - Motion sensors, the camera sends a remote feed to the drive, the minute the camera doesn't detect any movement it stops recording, it saves drive space. - This is Rewind. - Rewind, Fast-Forward, Pause and Play, just like any digital recording device. - Are you sure you don't want audio? - I don't wanna hear it, I just need to see them. - Were you scared? - He's a fucking junkie, if a man's desperate enough, he'll rob you blind. - What did you do with the body? - I was 19, I was living in London, he broke into my flat, he was looking for a fix, he had that look in his eye, he came at me, so I took a knife and I drove it into his heart. - So it was, it was self defense. - Jury didn't see it that way, I panicked, I'd had a couple of priors, there was now way I was going to prison, so I chopped up the body and I flushed it down the toilet. - You did? - I did 15 years for a fucking junkie, I'll never make that mistake again. - Maybe we should get going. (ominous music) (water trickling) Did you find it? - Not yet, is it valuable? - $40,000. - It's not here, pussycat, could you have left it at the hotel? - If I did, it's as good as gone. - Well, don't loose hope, I'll make a call. - Would you? - Of course, it's bound to turn up. - Winston. - I'm leaving for Rome, I'll be back in a week. - Right now, can I give you a ride? - I'll drive myself. - Well, have a good trip. Are you all right? - Shouldn't I be? - 40,000 my ass. I'd only get half of that on the street. - Plus the 10 I gave you and here's another 10, now that's all I've got, so we're square then? - Come here, come here! Closer... Closer... We're square. - You'll meet Ivan at Aqua to get the passports tonight. - Place on 4th, got it. - You pick up the passports between six and eight, go home and pack, then come here and pick me up at 9:30, our flight leaves at midnight. - And he comes home tomorrow? - That's what he told me. (plane engine roaring) - That's cutting it close. - We'll disappear and I'll be free. - I want the egg. You did test the code right? - We're not taking the egg. - What? - If I'm wrong about the code this whole thing is over. - The whole reason for doing this was for the egg, I've got a buyer. - Forget the egg, the whole reason for doing this is to be together, isn't it? - That egg is half mine. - So it is about the egg. - Absolutely. - I can't believe you. - Why would we leave with 200 grand, when we can have 20 million. - If we triggered the alarm, they could be waiting for us at the airport, passports and all, we'd get nothing but federal prison. We have enough money. - Your money. - Our money, we don't need the egg. - I'm not risking Federal prison for 200 grand. - We're not taking the egg and that's final. Now, are you getting the passports or am I? Are you in or you out, Angus? Angus, look at me. - All right, I'm in, I'll get the passports. - Then meet me here at 9:30. (deep exhale) (ominous music) (door creaking) - Are you Angus? - You're late. - We said nine o'clock. - Just tell me you have the passports. - Hey, be good to her. - Yeah, right (upbeat music) - Where do you think you're going? Get me my fucking money. - But the necklace, I thought we're square? - It's cut glass, it's worthless. - Check the bag, check the bag. - What am I supposed to do with this? Stick it up your ass? - I took it from a millionaire, it's got to be worth 100 grand, I need my passport. - You must really think I'm fucking stupid. You've got one week to find me 30 grand. One week. (dramatic music) - I've got you now. (police sirens wailing) (camera shutters) - [Detective Sparks] Lab just called, it's a match, it's her fingerprints, her blood in the bathroom. - [Detective Woo] And the blood on the painting? - [Detective sparks] Also a match. - [Detective Woo] So let's go over this again. - I've told you already, Angus Stewart murdered my wife, I went to Rome on a business trip, when I got home this evening, I found our master bath covered in her blood. The bastard took my dagger, he went upstairs and he drove the dagger into her while she was taking a hot bath. And he took the body, my painting and my Imperial egg and he loaded it into his car, he must have dumped the body before he got home, that's when you found him. The video proves he was the last one to see her alive, you have the dagger, my painting, a one-way ticket to leave the country under a false name, her blood is on the artwork and God knows where he hid the egg. The bastard killed my wife and stole my egg and I swear, he's gonna pay for it. - And how do you explain your shoes and surgical gloves in the trash outside his house? - He's a con, he wore the surgical gloves to kill her and he planted my shoes to frame me. - Then where's the body, give me a motive. - Motive? He had an opportunity to get away with $20 million, he killed my wife, he took the painting and my egg, he was fleeing the country, what more motive do you need? - It says here that your wife was in three months ago to file a domestic violence incident. - What? - Says she was frightened, afraid, then she thought better of it, dropped the charges and left. - My wife against me? I have no idea why she would make those claims. Are you gonna arrest me or not? - You're free to go. - Look, you nailed this Angus guy, you nail him good. - He hired me to tail his wife, he suspected that she was having an affair, we fell in love, it happens, she feared for her life, she knew this was going to happen, we were going away together, you can check with the travel agents, we bought our tickets. - Why do you have the dagger? - It's worth a lot of money, we needed something to survive on. - And the painting? - He planted it. - And the egg? - I don't know but he was the only one who knew the code. - He says his wife knew the code. - Well, now that's a lie. Look, you found his shoes and the gloves outside my home, what more do you want? You still think I did it, I told you what happened, he's a cold-hearted jealous psychopath, he threatened to kill her, when he found out about us, he lost it. It's true, I was with her earlier this evening, but when he came home and found the video, that's what would have pushed him over the edge. He grabbed the carving knife, he went upstairs to the bathroom to kill her, she coughed up my address before he slay her throat, he could've ditch the body anywhere. He loaded up the car with the painting and he planted it at my place while I was in Aqua. I was having a beer, you can check with the bartender, he killed his wife in a crime of passion and now, he's going to kill me, don't you see it? Look, if you want to know who killed Indigo Thorpe, you've got your man, it's Winston Thorpe. Where is he? - We let him go about an hour ago. - Look, I'm not a murderer. Whats that? - Your record, you did 15 years for the murder of Benjamin Bright. - That doesn't prove a fucking thing. - What about the cuts and bruises on your face? Clearly there was signs of struggle at the crime scene. - I told you, I got in a fight. - Look, just tell us what you did with the body. - The guy is a murderer, what do you mean we gotta let him go? - DA says there's no corpus delicti. - There isn't enough evidence to keep him? - Circumstantial and his alibi checks out. - He still had time. - We've had him here five hours, until we've got a body, we've got to let him go, just take him home, keep an eye on him. (police siren wailing) (care engine starts) (dramatic music) (metal clanking) - I told you what I do when I caught the bastard. - Killing me won't bring her back (Thorpe grunting) - Excellent, noon flight to Zurich, Swiss Air, thank you. (water trickling) (car door shuts) - What do you want now? - Angus Stewart is missing. We found blood. - I have a plane to catch. - Plane will have to wait. - We have a search warrant. - Well, be my guest. - Anything? - Not yet sir, we've done a preliminary sweep, nothing out of the ordinary. - Good, if you don't mind. - Sir, we found these upstairs. - We got a body in the koi pond, Angus Stewart. - And Mrs. Thorpe? - Still looking. - I'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Angus Stewart. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law, you have the right to an attorney-- - Sir, found these in the bushes behind the pool. - So what we got? - [Detective] And how do you explain your shoes and surgical gloves in the trash outside his house? - [Winston] He's a con, he wore the surgical gloves to kill her. He planted my shoes to frame me. - Looks like somebody's gotta (mumbles). - A little dizzy. - [Winston] But you lied to me, I knew you were up to something. - Should I come inside? - What the hell are you doing back inside my house? - [Rafael] So that's it? Adios Mr. Thorpe. - He's the help, I need to ask you an important question Rafael and I need you to tell me the truth. - How do you feel? - A little dizzy. - [Winston] When I got home this evening, I found our master bath covered in-- - [Detective] It says here that your wife was in three months ago, to file a domestic violence incident. - [Winston] My wife, I have no idea why she would make those claims. - You have to trust me Winston or this will never work. (somber music) (car door shuts) - Is everything okay? - Yeah, everything is fine. - Then you're free. - Thank you. (upbeat music)
