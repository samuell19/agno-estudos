Wait. No. I have a handkerchief in my purse. Do you mind? I would like to blow my nose. All right, all right.Thank you. Hey, Perez, look who we got here. Oh, my favorite punk, Rocco.

Look, all I want is I want my purse and I want to go home. But how can I? You have my keys. You have my money. I can't even take the subway. Lady. Lady, give me a break. We do things as fast as we can. Now, you wait here. We'll call you. [SOBBING] Hi. Are you okay? No, I'm not. [SNIFFLING] You ever have a black eye before? Once. Why, are you a doctor? No. No, I'm an attorney. My name's Edward Moran. What are you in here for? Well, what's that supposed to mean? Well, what did you do? Me?Yes. [STAMMERING] I didn't do anything. I was mugged. And then I was hit in the face and I've been sitting here for two hours without even a drink of water. Me? I'm not a criminal. Back home we didn't even have to lock our house. Here, you never even know who you're talking to. I'll tell you what, you give me a smile and I'll get you out of here. Is that a deal? I don't feel like smiling. It'll make my face hurt. That's too bad. Guess I'm going to have to get you out of here anyway. MARIAN: This car is yours? Yeah. Haven't you heard? Big lawyers have big cars. [SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] Yeah. This ought to bring you around. Um... Oh, it's only brandy. It's okay. [EXCLAIMS] You all right? I guess you're lucky you weren't killed, huh? [CHUCKLES] How long you been in New York? Um, 11 months. And you're single, from Indianapolis, and you work for Zimwear Fashions. How did you know that? I'm a psychic. I read palms. Really? [LAUGHS] No. I was with the desk sergeant when he went through your purse. [CHUCKLES] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Thank you. Sure. You know, I should walk you to your door. Oh, no. No. You sure?Yeah. [STUTTERING] I'll be fine. Really. Yeah?Yeah. Thanks again. Thank you. What for? I haven't the slightest idea. [LAUGHS] It must be something, though. [DOOR CLOSES] [TRAFFIC BUSTLING] MARIAN: Now the secret here is not to sew the bodice piece to the actual shell of the blouse. It can be added later and therefore it could be three or four different designs all sewn to the same shell. It's terrific. Now, can we make this shell out of a cheaper material? I don't think so. To match the cloth, we'd have to special order, and so we lose. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] She say she's cold. Yeah? Well, tell her it's a lot colder out in the street. [SIGHS] Now, by adding a waistband and three seams and a couple of buttons here... ...we have an ensemble. More cloth than labor. You're playing my tune, toots. You want to go for a cut? Sure. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Okay. I figure they want to go 9.95 apiece. Take off their 30%. Drop to $7. One buck for miscellaneous. If we don't beat $6.00, we're going to lose the contract. Well, can we do it? Oh, sure, if we had new machines and more girls. All we can do is bid 5.85 and go for it. Best, we squeak through. Worst, we close the doors. Who in the hell is that? [EXCLAIMS] It's him. Oh, my God! It's him. It's him?Uh-huh. You mean it's him?Yes, him! Oh, my God. Look at me. Hi. Am I... Am I interrupting something? Yeah. We were just going to sit down and play a game of jai alai. I'm Sylvia.Hi. Where'd you leave your horse? My name's Edward. And whose... What horse are we talking about? Well, the way I heard it, the prince always comes on a horse. Oh, I see. I see. You should've told me that you were coming. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. Fine? Really fine? Really. Yeah. Really? Good. That's it? "How are you? Fine. Really. Really." I thought you were gonna ask her out on a date. Sylvia! Well, what? I mean, it's not so difficult. Your serve. Actually, I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see how Miss Winslow was getting along and to find out whether or not she'd like to have dinner with me tonight? Did you mention that it was a fancy French restaurant? No, I didn't, but actually that's a good idea. [STUTTERING] No. EDDIE: No?I'm sorry. I have a lot of work to do. I have to get this proposal in. Baloney! The man says you need a meal. Sylvia, please. Oh, shut up, toots. Get going. Sylvia.Go on. [LAUGHING] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING SOFTLY] So, young girl with dream comes to the big city, takes her lumps and makes it, huh? Is that it? Yeah, that's it. Except I haven't made it. Well, not yet. Sometimes I think I'll just pack my bags and get back on the bus. Really? [CHUCKLING] No. Not really. I'm not a quitter. [CHUCKLES] Oh, okay. There's part of me that really believes. And last, but not least, I don't have anything to go back to. Nothing? Don't you have a family or something? No. No, I lived with my grandmother, and she died about a year ago. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, in a way I'm glad, selfishly. Ooh! Here's something that I know. Pate foie gras. Uh, isn't that... Yeah. That's goose liver. [EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST] Oh, no. I'm not crazy about it either. I wish I could speak another language. I'll tell you a secret. I speak Italian. Really?Yeah. Have you ever been to Italy? Oh, yeah, yeah. Several times. [EXCLAIMS] God, I would love to go there.

I've got to get up and go to court in the morning. [STUTTERS] You're not...What? ...married, are you? No. No, I'm not. I promise. [CHUCKLES] Good night. I had a wonderful evening. Yeah. Yeah.

How are you doing? Hi, Mom. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Where's Papa? He's resting.Yeah? How are you? [SIGHING] Did you take your pills today? You didn't, did you? [SIGHS] Who cares? Today is my new grandson come to visit. I can't wait. I get excited. Mom, that's why you take the pills, though. Edward, darling, if you tell somebody her name, maybe they can introduce themselves. Oh, I'm sorry, Gina. You're right. Excuse me, Mom. Marian... This is my mother. Mama, this is Marian Winslow. Nice to meet you. Thank you. And I'm Eddie's uncle. You can call me Sal. Nice to meet you.[CHUCKLING] Hi. You know, when you get as old as I am you get tired of looking at the same faces all the time. You got a nice one.[LAUGHS] Thanks. You know, Sal used to work in the garment business. Yeah. I had a big plant in Brooklyn. I had about 100 people. GINA: Oh, he'll talk your ear off. Come with me. I'll go see about the food. Okay, Ma. I'm good. I'm good. Listen, I'll talk to you a little later. All right? Hey, Frank. Come here. Eddie!How you doing? Good to see you. Listen. I want to introduce you to somebody. Frank, this is Marian Winslow. Marian, this is my big brother Frank. He's not bad for an old guy. [FRANK AND EDDIE EXCLAIMING] I'm kidding! You're young. You're young. I'm just kidding, okay? Golden boy has told us a lot about you. We're flattered he finally decided to bring you out. Oh, thanks, Frank. Oh, and, Gina, you already know Gina. She's a terrific girl. She blew it all by marrying Mr. Wonderful here. [ALL LAUGHING]I'm just kidding. [ALL LAUGHING] Hey. How's this kid going to grow up if you blind her old man? Oh, come on. One more, one more. [CAMERA CLICKING]Hey, Uncle Sal! Come on. Come over here. Take one of just the three of us. [ALL CHATTERING] [SPEAKING IN ITALIAN] Well, when you going to settle down and give me some grandchildren like your brothers, huh? What do you mean, Ma? I got 14 ordered. They haven't been delivered yet. [SPEAKING IN ITALIAN] [CHUCKLES] Frank. [WHISPERING] Hello, Mama. Where you going?Be right back, Ma. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Marian, we got to go up to the house for a minute. [SIGHING]We got to go see Pop. All right? We'll be right back.Okay. Go on. I'll take care of her. All right. Thanks, Gina. Be right back. I remember the first time I came here. I looked as lost as you do. [CHUCKLES] Come on. I'll show you around. Okay. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] It must be nice having such a big family. Well, on the holidays, when the other half shows up, [CHUCKLES] it gets to be a bit much. You haven't met them, have you? No. I hadn't met anyone till today. [WATER SPLASHING] Everybody seems very nice, though. Friendly. This is just so new to me. I don't... I don't quite know how to explain it. I wonder how much longer Eddie is going to be. [EXCLAIMS] When they start talking, it can go on for hours. Hours and hours. I didn't know that they worked together. [SIGHS] They have a lot of investments. [CHUCKLES] Eddie doesn't talk much about his work. I think he thinks it bores me. He told Frank you're a dress designer. Is that true? Yeah. Yeah, I am. I still have a lot to learn, though. That's what I wanted to be. I studied. I went to art school. I draw. I still draw. Really? You should come down to the plant sometime. I mean, who knows. If business gets better, maybe you can even come work with us. [CHUCKLES] Frank would lock me in my room before he'd let me get a job. Funny. Eddie's not that way. Eddie's different. He's the idealist. He's not like the others. Boy, God. He, Frank, Vinnie, they go at it sometimes. You're different, too. So, when are you getting married? [LAUGHS] What? Married? Yeah.Well, I... [STAMMERS] What makes you think that we're gonna get married? Eddie wants to settle down, and I can't remember the last time he brought a girl home to meet Mama and the family. Well, we really haven't known each other very long. I know dear Eddie pretty well. He moves fast, gets what he wants. [INAUDIBLE] MARIAN: I never met anybody like him. I don't know what I'm going to do. [STUTTERING] I mean, it's just... It's crazy. It's going too fast. And I feel like I'm totally out of control. Drunk! Eddie makes me dizzy. Yeah, I've been dizzy all my life. Open it. I don't have the guts. The letter. The bid. The contract was awarded on a bid of $5.38. And it's written down here in pen, "I'm very sorry about this, Sylvia," signed "Judy." Yeah. [SIGHS] I always feel like Sam Spade when I drink this. I'm afraid that this could be it, toots. I mean, that contract was make or break. Well, at least I own this building and I can sell it and have something to eat up in my old age. But remember what you said about new girls and new machines? Well, sure. But, God, you're looking at 150 grand. I can't raise money like that. And even if I could, I'd have to go out and find new contracts and then start moving again, and that takes time. And time is money, which we ain't got none of that either. Do you want a drink? No, thank you. Um, listen, uh... Eddie knows so many people. So many. Why don't you let me talk to him? At least let me try. Okay. Betwixt you and me, toots, that's a long shot. And the short shot is I go down the tubes and you, you gotta look for another job. No.Yeah. No, don't say that. [SIGHS] Oh, God, Marian. The day that you answered my ad for a designer, just was one of the nicest days of my life. Losing this business is going to be a lot easier than losing you. Well, you know something? What? You're not going to lose me, not ever. Don't you worry. I'm going to ask around. I'm going to... I'm going to find you another slot. And then when I do, I'm going to sock you 10% commission. [CHUCKLING] EDDIE: We're going.MARIAN: What? [EDDIE AND MARIAN CHATTERING] Why don't you hang onto me?I don't trust you. [GIGGLING]But you've got to trust me. You have no choice. Eddie, this is really crazy. I mean, what if somebody sees us? I'll have to buy the building. [LAUGHING] Hold on. Wait. Okay. Right there. Right there.Where? Don't move. Don't move.Don't move? Don't move. Stay right there. Like this?Just like that. Here you go. Give me your hand. Come on. Just follow me. That's it. Um...This way. Now, right over here. [GIGGLING] Right here.Okay. All right, dear. Okay. Don't move. I got to get this thing off you. I tied it in a knot. [LAUGHING]Hang on. All right. Here we go. Surprise. [EXCLAIMING] Oh, God, Eddie, this is beautiful. I've been dying to show it to you. Do you like it? Like it?Yeah. [EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF] I had it redone, for you. You... You... You did this for me? Yeah. You see, when I got it, it was terrible. It was brown and cream. It just didn't look right. You said peach, right? Yeah, I said peach.Yeah. Yes... [EXCLAIMING] Oh, God!What's the matter? Oh... I, uh... I can't... [CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY] I can't handle this. I mean... [LAUGHS IN DISBELIEF] You did this for me? Nobody ever did... You don't have to handle anything. Just go with it, that's all. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. When you asked me what my favorite color was, you'd already made up your mind? Are you angry? [CHUCKLES] Oh! How could I be?

[CHUCKLES] What world? ♪ I don't care ♪ As long as you are there ♪ As long as... Eddie?Yeah? I love you. [SIGHS] I love you so much. Why me? What do you mean?No, come on. I want to know. Why me? Okay. I'll tell you. Once upon a time, there was an ancient legend about a prince. [LAUGHING] Don't laugh. It's true. About a prince who was looking for his princess. He traveled everywhere. Until one day he saw her. And suddenly out of the sky, came La Fondra, the thunderbolt. It strikes a man when he sees that one particular woman. And his heart instantly stops and everything changes. And he realizes that the most important thing on Earth is the possession of that one woman. He must have her or he will be lost forever. [BREATHING DEEPLY] Anyway, it's a loose translation [LAUGHING] but I think that's pretty close. Is this just physical between us? I mean... What?Someday is this just going to wear off? Go away? I love you. [EXCLAIMING] Are you my prince? Yeah. If that's what you want. You know what I want? [SOFTLY] What? I want... What? I want to make you happy.

I know he spent his life in the trade, but one has to wonder where. Well, Eddie said he made uniforms. Figures. Did you see that crap that he's bringing in from Mexico? Oh. Those beads?Yup. I thought he was kidding. No, he's not kidding. We import them and then we sew them on to these little fancy shells, and then we unload them by taking them around to flea markets all over the city. Not only that, he wants to use the label. I said, "No way." I said if we're going to do it, then we get another label and we're going to call it Kitsch Fashions.

I know you're angry, even if you're too nice to say anything. I should've told you what you were getting into. I wanted to... But I couldn't. We have to keep our mouths shut even among ourselves. About three years ago, there was a girl married to Johnny. Johnny is one of the guys who works here. And she started talking about the family in public, about who was who, who did what, where the money came from. Then one day she just disappeared. Are you saying what I think you're saying? It comes down to one of the rules. If a husband can't control his wife, he won't be trusted to control men. Johnny had no choice. Oh, my God! Gina... You're talking about the Stone Age. Marian, nothing about this family is new. [HORSES NEIGHING] Did you... Did you know before you were married? [SIGHS] I grew up in the neighborhood. You... You just always knew. Like the guys who were connected, had money... Give you the best time. It was glamorous. Like the movies. And who knows? Maybe what he does is part of who he is and it turned me on. I'll never forget that first limousine ride. After that... I was hooked. How do you deal with it? You don't. You... You push it out of your mind. I read a book once. It said people only see what they want to see anyway, so... But... But you live in fear that one day they won't come home. I have dreams about Frank. Terrible dreams. Oh, come here. [SOBBING]It's okay. It's all right. I love him.I know. I love him. I'm not strong anymore. I don't know how much longer I can hold myself together. Why don't we get out of here? We'll just leave. Right now. You and me together. You can't leave. I can't stay here. [STUTTERING] I can't, Gina. I have to go. I can't. I mean... It just... It doesn't make sense. And I can't do it. I won't be a prisoner. [BRANCH SNAPPING] Hello, Gina. How's it going? You could at least introduce me to Mrs. Moran. He's with the FBI. Name's Lou Di Luca. The computer in my office tells me there's going to be some kind of, well, confrontation. We know the players in the game, but we don't know the where or when. If we did, we could stop it, but we don't. We do know that the Moran brothers made a mistake in Miami. And some of their Cuban friends want to return the favor, which is why they went for you the other day. And nobody wants to talk about what you'd look like if they pulled it off. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] You shouldn't be out here alone. Better get back up to the house. Gina... Help us, and we'll help you before it's too late. Where's Frank? Tell us and maybe, just maybe, we'll have enough pieces to put the brakes on. Gina, there's going to be killing. No. How can you have any loyalty to these people? To them. You think you owe them for what they've done to you? Shut up. You're throwing your life away, and for what? A few romantic crumbs from the table of a guy who isn't worth... He's my husband and I love him. Okay, Gina. Here. [SIGHS] Here. Take it. Open it. You recognize Frank, your loyal husband? We never did get the name of the ladies. It's... They're fake. They're glued together. You see that in a supermarket. They're real. You don't know him, but the difference between you and Gina is only a matter of time. If you stay in the program. Listen, when you need a friend... Remember Lou Di Luca. Call, and I'll be there. Isn't Di Luca an Italian name? That's right. A lot of people have Italian names. Real people. Decent people. I'm... I'm sorry. I meant... I know what you meant, but the fact remains that a few of those bastards make the rest of us look bad. Believe me, what you become in life isn't stamped on your birth certificate. Don't forget this, hmm? How you doing? I was getting worried about you guys. Any changes? No. Goin' at a wall. The guys from Red Bank get here? Yeah. Sal, where's Marian? Down by the grove. [DOG BARKING] EDDIE: Marian. Marian. Where have you been? You lied to me. You said you were a lawyer. I am a lawyer. And what else? That "what else" doesn't concern you or us. It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist? No, it doesn't. Well, then I guess this has all been a really big practical joke. No, it's no joke. Well, then, if it doesn't exist, there's no reason for us to stay imprisoned here, is there? Well, that's wonderful news. I'm going to go up to the house, I'm going to pack my bag and have Aldo take me into the city. You know, you've spent too much time with Gina. She puts ideas in your head. That woman's a lush. Well, how did she get that way? God... Why? Why didn't you just tell me about this right from the start? Would you have married me? Huh? What, did you think that this was just going to go on, that I was never going to find out? I just... I just thought you'd eventually understand and accept like the others. Look at me. Look at me! I love you. The only thing I thought about, and all I still think about is you. Now anything after that is just a dumb conversation. So, let's go back...No! No. This is not just a dumb conversation. You want me just to forget about everything that I think is right and wrong. Well, I can't do that. I can't, I can't, I can't live like the rest of them, paranoid. I can't do it! What do you want from me? What the hell do you want me to do? I want you to walk through that gate with me and I never want us to come back here. Oh, is that what you want?Yes! Ah, I see. I want us to just... To get a house and just live like real people do, together. That's what I want. I was hoping it would be something easy, like maybe cut off my hand. Marian. [BREATHING HEAVILY] I don't want to lie to you. Look, I've thought about leaving all this behind, believe me, more than once. I've thought about trying to be someone else, but I don't know how to do that. I wouldn't know how to live. This is my family. Do you understand? Together we can try. Well, you don't know what you're asking. You have no idea what we would be up against. I told you, Marian, there are rules, rules that nobody can break. No. No, I don't care. I don't... I don't care about rules, 'cause I know... I know that together we can do anything. Anything if you love me. If I love you? [SIGHS] [SOBBING] It's all right. [HELICOPTER APPROACHING] [GUNS FIRING] [WOMEN SCREAMING] Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on. This way. [ALL PANICKING] Come on. Eddie's out there! Come on! [GUNFIRE] [PANTING] Come on! Come on. Go on up the hill. Let's go. Frank! Frank! Get inside. Don't, Frank. Frank! Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank... [GINA SOBBING] [WAILING] No! MAMA: [SOBBING] No! Gina... EDDIE: I don't want to talk about this anymore. Vincent, I told you it's over, once and for all. I can't believe you're saying this. Have you forgotten Frank? Frank's going to be in front of my eyes every day for the rest of my life. Now, they paid for Frank. They paid plenty and you know that. It's not enough. It's not enough for me. Sal, killing 50 more is not going to bring him back. Maybe not, but we've got to teach him a lesson. Benito, you listen to me. All of you. Now, this thing is over and it's time to move on. No, Eddie, I want us to go back down there... Vinnie, that's it! That's enough! We're going to do this thing my way, and that's all! Why don't you come along with me on this one? Come on. [SIGHS] All right? All right. Come here. Come here. All right, we're going to talk more tomorrow. Everything's going to be all right. Okay? Sal... Bye. Come on, toots, cheer up. Try to put it behind you. What should I do? You're asking for advice from a dame who's never been with anybody but Sidney Zimmerman? Look, you've got to analyze it. Eddie is handsome, he's smart, he's rich. He's got a good career going for him. He's a lawyer. And he can dance away the night, he can drive you around in a big black car, he can make you laugh. I mean, he's a regular Clark Gable. Just one little flaw... Clark has a little leprosy. Yeah. Well, you know... Leprosy is very contagious. These are the ones I take care of. Don't mix them up. Si, patron. I mean it. Another shipment? How come? Well, we got good and tooled up. We run out of these, we're in trouble. See how they're selling? Yeah. I'll never understand it. I would have bet good money against it. You'd have lost your shirt. I won't argue that. Then don't. Creep. Whoo! I... I think I'm going to get a glass of milk. Marian. Where are we? Huh? I don't know. I love you. Do you believe that? Yes. Do you love me? Yes. But not like before, right? Too many things get in the way. Get rid of them. They're not my things. They're yours. I can't do anything about that. You know what I want to do? I want to go someplace. I just want to go someplace, just the two of us, just for a while, you know. We could go to the Caribbean. Would you like that? I mean, we could just, we could just get lost for a while. There'll be no phones, no family, no nothing. That's what you wanted, right? Huh? But we'd have to come back eventually. Wouldn't we? [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Who the hell could that be? [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOOR OPENS] What is it? It's him. Sidney's brother is a pharmacist. He did me a favor. This is coke, Marian. These bastards have been bringing in cocaine from Mexico and running it through our business. Cocaine. What do you have to say to that, prince? Is that true? It's Sal. He's always after something. I should have known better. How could you? Look, it's not me. I don't get anywhere near that stuff. I don't want to know about it, all right? Oh, bull! You don't expect either one of us to believe a word you say, do you? Let me tell you something. If it weren't for Marian, I wouldn't be here. I'd be talking to the cops. Now, I want that garbage out of my plant. I want Sal out of my plant. And I want it now! Or I'm going to blow the whistle. I'll see what I can do. I don't want your conversation. I want it out! It's not as simple as that, Sylvia. The hell it isn't. You tell your family to get their fannies over there and to get it out. It's not just our family. Everybody's in on this one, and some are big. Bigger than all of us. So, if I were you, I wouldn't make waves. Oh, don't threaten me. I'm too old to care. I want it out. I'm sorry. I'm sorrier than I can say. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] I'm going to leave Eddie. Figures. You want to come and stay with me for a while? Thanks. I haven't gotten that far yet. Sylvia, what are we going to do about those beads? I mean, Eddie won't talk to me. It's like he's hiding from me. Don't worry. I am taking care of it. Okay. [SCREAMING] MARIAN: Sylvia! No! [HORNS HONKING] Get an ambulance! [SOBBING] Go! Get an ambulance! MAN: Call an ambulance. Go! Get an ambulance! MARIAN: I saw Benito's face. He pushed her. Killed her. But I... I still didn't want to come here. I just wanted to get on a bus and disappear. And then I started thinking about Sylvia. And what they did to her. And what she'd want me to do. If she hadn't called the police, do you think she'd be alive? No. They would have killed her anyway. That's it for now, Tina. Thanks. What about me? I'm not as brave as she was. I'm scared. You don't have to be. We won't let anything happen to you. How far are you prepared to go with this? How far do I have to go? Depositions and down to actual testimony in court. The entire works. With you, we'll get everybody. [SIGHING] First, we'll get you settled. Tonight, we'll put you in a hotel. Now, don't worry. You're in official protective custody. Someone will be with you at all times. But I don't have any of my things, my clothes. We'll see that you get new ones. Whatever you need. Tomorrow we'll take you to a place in the Berkshires and do some paperwork. And then we go to work on building you a new life, somewhere where they'll never find you. Okay? Larry, tell Ernie to bring the car around, will you? The usual place. And stay with her until I get there. I promise, the rooms are better. But not much better. 412, please. Thank you. [GROANING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [GASPS] [SCREAMING] No! Stop it! [MUFFLED SCREAM] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Is she here? I haven't seen her. Let me in. I can get a warrant, Gina. Now, let me in. Harry, check the bedrooms. [SIRENS WAILING] What's happened? Marian agreed to cooperate with us, and she's disappeared. Do they have her? Probably. Where would they take her, Gina? I don't know.I need help. I don't know. The last time I asked you, people died. I need help. I don't know! God! I don't know! The bedrooms are clean. I'll check outside. Forget it. She's not here. I know you two were very close. [SIGHS] So long, Gina. I'll see you around. Lou. If anything happens to her, you call me. I will. You're not like the other wives. You never were. I should've known better. Hmm? You killed Sylvia. How could you do that? I never killed anyone. It wasn't an accident. Did I say it was? I told you, Marian. I told you there are rules. It all seems so long ago. [SOBBING] What a fool I was. I believed. I believed in Cinderella and the Prince. I believed in everything. You know... You look like you did the first time we met. We had it all. Yeah. We did. I don't understand you. No, you don't. Marian, I love you. I don't want you to ever forget that. [GUNSHOT] [GROANS] [DOGS BARKING]
