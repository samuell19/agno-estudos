I'm getting tired of making you look bad. It's hard goddamn work for a man to make another man look so bad. Man, I'm fixing to dog you, punk. I'll dog you right now. Let me shut this shit up. Give me the ball. You got the pill. You shoot, I'll knock it out the sky. You can't take it to the hole. - You ain't good enough. - You think so? I don't think. I know. What are you gonna do? Where you going? You can't dribble. Bring it, bring it. Move, move. Get that shit out of here. That shit went out like a SCUD missile. Oh, it hurts, it hurts so bad. Babies, let me tell you something. I don't mean to brag, but I'm the greatest. I am the greatest. - You all right, man? - Yeah. Get your butt up and play. Take your little Colt 45-drinking ass off some place. Yes, Walter. Hard goddamn work making you look so bad. Man, you fouled me. Foul? - Foul? - Take the ball out and shut up. What's the count? - 9-8, us. - 9-8, you? Get the fuck out of here. If you could count, you'd be an astronaut. It's 9-8, us. George, your mother's an astronaut. He talking about your mama, man. He playing you and your mama for a punk. My mother ain't no astronaut. Say it, say it. Your mother ain't no astronaut, your father ain't no astronaut, all right? Well, my mama ain't no astronaut. You understand me? Look, me saying that your mother's an astronaut... is just another way of saying that you're all fucked up. Cool. Well, let's just get off mamas, because I just got off yours. Ow. Keep my mama out of this, brother. She's out. - She's out. - Cool. Cool. She's out. Cool. She's out. What time should I bring the bitch back? Yo, what's the score? 9-8, us. What? We can't be losing to you. If we lose to you, I'll kill myself. I don't want to do that. - Fuck you, skinny boy. - Fuck this. You fat motherfucker. Fuck this. Shut up. You're giving me Excedrin number fucking trillion headache. Hey, what's the score? Chump, yo, I'm talking to you. What, you deaf or something? I'm talking to the fucking air. My name ain't Chump, it's Billy Hoyle. Billy Hoyle. Billy Hoyle. Billy Hoyle. Okay, Billy. Now, can you count to 10, Billy? - Yeah. - Good. - What's the score, Billy? - I don't know. Then you're a chump. I may be a chump, I just said that wasn't my name. He punked your ass, Sid. Fuck you. Let's go. 8-8, your ball. It's 9-8, your ball. I don't want no excuses. I call it even. Your ball. You better call a doctor. Take the ball. - It's your ball. - I said it's your... Take the ball. - Your woman calling you, man. - Sidney. Your woman calling you, man. Well, at least I got one. Your mother's so poor, I seen her kicking a can down the street. She said she was moving. Your mama's so old, she used to drive chariots to high school. Your mama's so fat, she fell over, broke her leg and gravy poured out. - Hey, baby. - Hi, honey. I was buying food, the check didn't clear and I had no cash. Baby, I'm sorry. Will a 20 do? Thirty would be better. You hustling me? You're the only one who can get away with that. I got a couple things working here. I got to go. Daddy has to go back to work. They're trying to cheat me. Talk to you. Told your mama to act her age, she dropped dead. Your mother got a wig with grey sideburns. Your mama's teeth are so yellow, she can butter a whole loaf of bread. Shut up. Save your breath. You need all the energy you can get. Let's go. - I can't run, man. - What? My bunions hurt. Get someone to play for me. Come here, baby. That's okay. You're still my hero. That's it, baby. Wait a minute. Who can replace Mr Handicap? Anybody for Mr Fucking March of Dimes? Hey, take Billy Ho here. No, I don't want him. He might be good. - I won't go with this. - Why not? - Because I'm white. - He's white. He is white. Look at him. It won't matter. You could bring Bernard King in. We hit two, we're out. Swish. Swish. Let's go, Billy Ho. Ha ha ha. Let's go. Hey, ain't no need for that Jane Fonda, geriatric bullshit. You just come out here, play some D. Two quick ones... It's over. See ya. Wouldn't want to be ya. You got a new teammate. Kiss your game goodbye. Hey, maybe I need to do that shit too. You loose now? Let's play. Come here. Let me teach you something. Hey, man, get your ass out of here. Come here, I'll tell you where I'm going. Over there, right. You're a hotshot, huh? Where are you going? I got you. Show me what you got. This is my court, you hear me? Luck. Pure luck. I believe the score is 9-8, ours. Take it out. Ball in. Okay, chump. The sun even shines on a dog's ass some days. Anybody can win the lottery. Know what I mean? Give it up. You want it back now. Fuck you. Your mother's an astronaut. She's too drunk to be an astronaut. You remind me of one of those dudes from The Brady Bunch. Doesn't he look like one of them? He looks like Cindy. Yeah, that's the one. Why are you laughing? Calling me Brady Bunch. He's too stupid to know he's being insulted. Get off the court, Sidney. You lost. Ease back. Give me a second with Mr Brady Bunch. You may be able to pull off a couple of passes. That don't mean you can play this game. Right. You ain't seen me shoot. Maybe I can't shoot a lick. What's it worth to you to find out, huh? Say, what have we got here? Fifty, sixty... sixty-two dollars. I do detect the smell of cash. In the air. How good are you, chump? - "Chump"? "Chump"? - That's your money. My only problem will be pulling the ball out of your ass... when I take your money. - And that is his money. - Money talks. Twenty, forty, fort-one... You're short. Big Junior. Man, loan me 20. What do I look like, Bank of America? - Yeah, give me a loan. - You always do this. I won't lose to this white boy. You better not lose my money to this white boy. This is a black thing. Now give me the fucking 20. - Then we eat at Sizzler? - Surf and turf. - I'm the bank. - That's his money. - That's his money. - Let's go, baby. Best of five, top of the key. And since you're the foreigner... as such, you can go first. No, thank you, Sidney. You go ahead. No, this is my house. This is Sidney Deane's house. Since I'm the host, I extend my hospitality to you. That's very gracious, but I don't want your hospitality. I don't want to take advantage of you. Okay, but you might not get another shot. Okay, if you insist. This is outdoor ball. Different than your country club shit. When you shoot, you adjust for the wind. Out here, the wind can push the ball to the left or right 6 to 8 inches. But you wouldn't know nothing about that. You want me to move? I'm sorry. It's your shot. This is really not my spot. I'll be lucky to hit two out of five. But I'll shoot anyway. Oh, man. Right off the bat. I am feeling lucky. Man wants to get paid. It's pretty. It's so pretty. ♪ We 're going Sizzler we 're going Sizzler ♪ Ah. ♪ We going Sizzler ♪ I never hit two in a row. But I'm very lucky. I'm feeling very lucky. Ugly shot. Looked like a goddamn brick. No aesthetic beauty whatsoever. Now mine, on the contrary... It hurts being this good. A thing of beauty is a joy forever. My man John Keats said that. You know that, right? You know, I've never hit three in a row. Never in my life. Colour me lucky, man. Sometimes you wake up, the birds are singing... That's a decent shot. Excellent. You are the greatest. - Thank you. - But I'm feeling so lucky. Four in a row. This is like the luck of the Irish, only I'm not Irish. So go figure. Come on, Sidney. Come on, now. Don't worry, I got this under control. This sucker's mine. Michael Jordan was down here once. I took him to the hole. You believe that? That's right, I saw it. Michael said, "You should play summer pro league." - I said, no. - Hell no. - Might mess up my game. - We can't have that, Billy Ho. Shoot this one and let's go to Sizzler. I'm gonna just leave it up there. - Give me some. - I will. Oh, shit. It's hard goddamn work being this good. Shut the fuck up. - Am I starting to get to you? - No, Sidney. You're just making my ears hurt. See, you guys look at me, you see the backwards hat... the funky outfit and you say, "This guy's a chump." - A fucking geek. - A fucking geek. Exactly. But you don't realise it ain't easy. "It is hard goddamn work making something this pretty"... look like a geek. So I must do it for a reason. I'm convinced, whatever the reason may be. If I miss this shot, I walk away, still a chump. But if you miss, you've been beat not once... but twice, by a slow, white, geeky chump. Ain't no thing. Ain't no thing. No thing but chicken wing on a string. From Burger King. The wind's kicking up a bit. You might want to adjust about... six, eight inches to the left. Here it is. This is the big one. Don't worry. I've hustled much better players than you. Don't put up a brick. Stop yapping and let the brother shoot. Yeah, I got it. The wrist. - Brick. - Shit. Give me my money. - It belongs to him. - A man with integrity. - Don't push your luck. - It wasn't luck. You said we'd go to Sizzler... Man, shut your anorexic, malnutrition, tapeworm-haying...

Nobody knows me here. I can work the courts. I have a business proposal. It means more cash than this chump change you make. What is it? There's a two-on-two tournament next week, sponsored by businesses. - You want me to run with you? - Yep. In the meantime, we can make some extra change. If you don't mind hustling.

This ain't no diamond. It's a zircon. Okay. Let's say this piece of shit is worth 300 bills. I'll put my $1,700 against your $1,150. That's a bet. Hey, give me my money. I'll hold it. I ain't going nowhere. He ain't going nowhere. The bakery ain't open yet. We play to 10. - That's a bet. - Let's do it. We got a game to play. Hey, Martha Graham. Martha Graham. Can you play? - Good pick, man. - You know it. That's what I'm talking about. Go back to Sea World. - You let him back-door you. - I thought he was gonna pass. Of course he wasn't... D up, man. You don't know what D is. Go, you fucking Globetrotter. Aren't you gonna shoot? - He was on my ass. - You were wide open. I got $1,700 on the line. I won't force a shot. Why are you kicking it to me? - All right, I'm sorry. - You okay? - Let's go. - You got it. - Get me the ball. - It's 9-8, us. Point game. - One more bucket, we get $1700. - A bucket you'll never see. - You tried to hustle us, but... - You gonna chitchat or play? Get the fuck out. You talking all this shit. Why don't you take me to the hole? - I practise off people like you. - Just learn to play. Ball, ball. I'll take your money, then I'll take your girl. You're holding me. All you do is hold people. You know, you're disgusting. Both of you, go back to Sea World. Seventeen hundred. Goddamn. Give me my money. It was so nice just to hold it for a while. I am dead. I am dead. I'm sorry, man. I thought I had it. I'm dead. I'm dog meat. She is gonna dump me now. I feel terrible. I had a lousy game. We're better than them. I've beat guys 10 times better than that. I know. It's my fault. It's nobody's fault. Sometimes the ball just doesn't go down. - Look, man. You want a ride? - I'm taking the rail. You sure? I got to think of how to tell Gloria I lost everything we had again, and figure out where I'm gonna sleep tonight. Hey, Billy, I'm sorry, man. I mean it. I'm sorry. "Thirty-nine" is the answer. What's the question? "How many books in the Old Testament?" I am so fucking good. - Did Jeopardy call yet? - Not yet. But I'll need a nice dress. When they call, you got to be ready. Want to hear the books of the Old Testament backwards? Malachi, Zechariah, Haggai and... Honey, please. And I did "Famous Women" and "Foods That Start with Q." You can't imagine how many foods actually start with the letter Q. Honey, will you please shut up? What's wrong with you? I lost the money. Oh, Jesus, Billy. Not again. - How much? - A lot of it. Most of it. Roughly all of it. You lost all our fucking money? Shit, Billy. Jesus, man. $1,700. Billy. We were on our way to 8,000. Were your opponents that good? No, I beat better guys in Brooklyn and Jersey. - You missed your jump shots? - No, I hit mine. What about Sidney? He had an off day. He wasn't shooting that much. This guy scored on him and he didn't... D up. He usually plays good D. You got hustled. I did not get hustled. You got set up. You got hustled by Sidney. - No. He's a good guy. - You said he was full of shit. He's full of shit and he's a good guy. You're full of shit, okay? Fuck that shit. I'm going back to that house and get my fucking money back. No, no, no. Honey, a man cannot ask for his money back. He lives in the jungle, right? No, honey, we can't. They don't let white people in the Crenshaw District. And maybe not Puerto Ricans. It's reverse discrimination. Let's see. We drove Sidney to Crenshaw and... You don't understand how things work. Men understand how they work. Wasn't there a big apartment house? Let me explain. Men's rules are very simple. If you win, you win. You lose, you lose. But under no circumstances do you ask for the money back. - Why not? - It's not part of the rules. Oh, yeah? I got a different set of rules of my own. Do you want to hear them? Here they go: Sometimes when you win, you really lose. And sometimes when you lose, you really win. Sometimes when you win or lose, you actually tie. And sometimes when you tie, you actually win or lose. I hate when you talk like that. It makes me crazy. Winning and losing is just a big organic globule... from which one takes what one needs. I'm fucked. Forget it. I'm not getting off this bus, honey. I'm not getting off the bus. No. Stop. Can we discuss it? Can we have a discussion? Does Sidney Deane live here? He does. He's my husband. Well, your husband stole $1,700 from my boyfriend. Really? Just a minute. Some people are here who say you stole their money. Come on in. Oh, shit. No, baby, I didn't steal his money. I hustled his money. - Cindy Brady. - That girl is fine. Cindy, what happened? What the fuck do you want? - Who invited you in, anyway? - I did.
