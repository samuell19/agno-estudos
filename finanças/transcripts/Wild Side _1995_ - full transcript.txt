With his private plane still. With a bank, it is about relationships. If he wants something, you do that. Are you crazy? Do wake up. You have to do what I say. My boss is withdrawing my mortgage if I do not fuck with customers. But I do not mind. If necessary, it must. But I only do it for myself. What are you looking at ? - I dont like it. I have to protect you from yourself. If you get caught? Say goodbye to your bank career. Would they take me because I want to keep my house? You're crazy if you do it. - I have to do something about my debts. I know you still $ 200,000 must pay off. Was married to Kevin. Not yet. You are going too fast. Put it up again. Try again. Slowly. Put it up again. You have no self-control and you are frustrated Johanna, you're a modern woman with an old profession. Now for my finances of sex depending, I think about it more often. There? Sit down. - If you're good, it's good. Then I forget my other work. Debts are in the family, but I am now on the right track. What do you do for work? - That is not important. I do that from nine to five. In the evening I come into it gray area. Do you want tomorrow at seven? I know you're free, but it's an old customer. Not in terms of age. He is on the golden Amex list. Special stuff ? - Oh no. He is at St. Edwards Courts. His name is Bruno Buckingham. 1.78, 2.54, 6.23, 1.74. Do you have that ? Take a drink. I do not know the course. 1.78 or 79. I'm not in Venezuela. - The purchase price in Caracas is 1.83. Caracas is 1.83. Sit down. Forward, 1.80 then. I have to hang up. Greetings to Dolores. You play the market, hu? I smell that. It is more that the market is playing me. can you smell something like that? $ 1500? I think that's worth it. I do not give anything for money. Mine or yours? You're a beautiful girl. You remind me of my daughter. A cheek. Come on. Let's do a sex game. That will cost me more. It's free for you. For you. Come along, you will get therapy. Really ? What kind of therapy? - That's a surprise. I'm afraid. Take off your clothes. I come for Mr. Bruno Buckingham. - I do not know if he's there. Who are you ? - His new psychotherapist. Johanna, with an H. What are you nervous, Bruno. Why is that ? Sit down. What do you want to know ? - First of all: Why do you have me sold for $ 100? I find that so disturbed. It is immoral and disrespectful to drop off a professional girl. I get a kick out of that. I admit. I'm disturbed. - And you want me to heal you. Do you want to get rid of it? Do you want me to heal you? You want to get rid of it. Do you know what you have? A substitution syndrome. Sex and money. That is more common. - I feel so guilty. I will help you to work on the child in you. Confess it. You must confess to me. That is very nice. Do not. Stop. Do not. I am a professional. You have to talk about money. Get off. A professional what? You are a dominant sex cat. Why should I talk about money? I do not care about that. Are you a banker at times? Do you know who I am ? Do you know who you are talking to? No idea. Say it. Never mind. They say I'm big. You're a big one. I'm a big one and you're here to do it with me. Great sir, You can not rush me. I'm a dominant cat, remember? Come here. I have to say something. I'm not just doing it for the money. I'm a former sex addict. I now have a relapse. Are we going to do wild? It will be a little later. You're here at five to half past nine exactly. Back to the therapy. I want a full session. Some people are going to church to confess. Not me. I do not trust priests. You trust me. With me you can feel guilty fucking away ... so that you can do it again. Some people go to church to confess. Wait a second. Wait a minute. Keep on talking. Thank you. Wait. Stay calm. Watch out. Are you still okay ? There's something about that girl. Who is it ? She is in the bathroom. You can laugh later. She's an agent. Bet ? - A female cop. I want you to take her the fire test. Here you have five hundred dollars. If it's a cop, she refuses to do it with you. I have a tough week ahead of me. I do not need an F.B.I slut in my bed. Show yourself. Then you get a bullet through your head. Just kidding. It is not real, you know. I save that. Watch. - I have to leave. Will I take her home? - Go ahead. Do not do it without it. How much did you get? It's a niggardly hufter. He is nowhere without me. It's a paranoid bastard. Do you know ? I like him. Really. I would go through the fire for him. Really. I am also paid for that. Do you know I'm in the mood? That can happen. I'm horny. What do you say about that? Good for you. But I can not. I have an appointment tonight. Then I know it well. $ 300 for a quickie. Right now. A little action. Go ahead. No, 300 dollars? If necessary in the car. My boss says you are sex addict. I'm glad he liked that. That's part of my act. I am leaving here. You say it. I love you too well. Agreed? Other times then. Drive carefully, frigid bitch. Hello, honey. Did he not show up? No, it was an excuse. How do you know where I live? I can come after everyone's address. I have a connection. I'm a bullet. And do you know who wants to fire me on you? My God. He thinks I'm with the police. What did he do ? The F.B.I. is after him, the taxes, Interpol, you name it. I had to give this to you. Five hundred dollars cash. Bruno knows that eager undercover agents ... only have sex with their main victim. They never work out for running boys like me. Then they lose the thread. They focus on the big cock. My job is Bruno's doubts to dispel. Just things in a row. I have to fuck with you ... to prove that I'm not from the police? Something like that, yes. - Did you think of that yourself? Do me a favor. I'm doing you a favor. You're not a raunchy whore, Alex. You are a fancy aunt. You're from the business world, right? Is it not, Miss Johanna, with an H? You work at a bank. God Almighty. I know everything about you, Alex. What would your boss say about it if he finds out this? Then your business career can flush through the WC. And what should I tell my boss? That you did not want me? Do I have to return his money? You just love that? You say I was great, then our bosses are both satisfied. I do not do that, that goes against my conscience. And I am very conscientious. And if you turn out to be the police? - You know I'm not. You're trying to blackmail me, soul's foot Then I go on the personal tour. I like you. Not me. you can only do so come to your liking? Disgusting. You can find that, you know. I think you're good at me and if so, it is not blackmail. Can I kiss you ? Are we going to argue? Blackmail, rape, You do not care, do you? I can feel that you feel like it. You are excited. You have to see those pupils. Come here. Listen carefully. It is very simple. You fuck with me or I'm going to fuck you. What will it be ? Madam may say it. Yummy. Do you like it too? I am in you. I like you. Do you feel Me ? Do you know that I'm a whore too? A whore, just like you. We are both the same. We will win back our soul. I want my soul back. The redemption is near. I was in hard time. You too ? Look at me. It was delicious. Good. Good. I want to show you something. Look. You see ? You were not the undercover agent. It was me. Sorry. That's how I had to do it. You will understand it soon. I will tell you this. You're ace for a very big shark. You know who I am talking about. Bruno. - Exactly. Mr. Thirteen Percent, that's it. He is the biggest washer of money that is there. Evaded tax money, money from extortion, you name it. He makes all money lily-white for 13 percent. Except drug money. Then his conscience revolts. Just kidding. I thought he did not really exist. It is true. He really exists. He has 169 million on an account in Beverly Hills. We've seen it for a while. We could have taken the money like that. But we want him. I want him. That's why I wait and drive him. And I say: Yes sir, no sir. Yes, Mr. Bruno. And why ? Because I set up the trap. It's my business. And you're going to help me. I want you to see the F.B.I. calling. Device 941. Tell them you're from Exxon. Then you get my boss. Then it will be fine. I'll visit you again. You will like it. I have a lot of confidence in you. We will be a good team. You're really me appreciate it though. Who do I speak with? - Drove. This conversation is recorded. One of your agents, number 5177, has raped me in my own house. Your mother's maiden name is ... Rickett. And your employer is Long Beach Pacific Bank, head office? How do you know that? Is Mr. Ross from department abroad your chef? I've been raped. What has to make my employer? I want to let you know that if you want to make an official declaration ... we have to report your employer that according to the law on prostitution ... there can be instigation. Nasty bastards. She is not from the police. Four o'clock. What a time. Is she from the tax authorities? - From the Long Beach Pacific Bank. Good job. She works up the foreign exchange department or something like that. No, genitals. Stop. Out of the way. Hurry up. Look at me. Are you falling on her? Do you want to be with her? Four hours long? I? She's tough, you know. She ignored me. She did not even pretend. She just talked about you, that you were so wonderfully experienced. She pretended to be Superman. I did not even get it up. A bank ? I knew there was something. Let's go. Women... You can not with and not without them. With me. You should not call me here. Just dim. Listen. That big shark has his prey gobbled up. That's you, honey. You have to dim. Otherwise I will ruin everything. And then we both hang out. And never call me baby again. Do not blame me. I was a bit too quick. Bruno sends someone to the bank to open a bogus account. You have to let it run smoothly. Do you listen? One Virginia Chow wants to open an account. She wants to be helped by you. Send her on. Virginia Chow. - Alex Lee. Pleasant. Sit down. Sorry I do not have an appointment. Do you like chocolate? Tax free, so it was not a tax. Chinese joke. Thanks. I love chocolate. What can I do for you ? I want to open a business account. We are in Shanghai and Hong Kong. I'm friends with Mr. Chen. That is a very good customer of us. Are you foreign? What a beautiful picture. Better than mine. Are you alone? Yes. The bill comes to my name. - Do you want checks? I want a good relationship with you. I sell shoes for everyone and I'm expanding. My company. Fine. Draw here and here, then it's okay. Your English is excellent. As a child of 14 I went to San Francisco. He was a shoemaker at the opera from Beijing, where I sat. I am busy with the costumes for Salom here in Long Beach. The opera is both in the blood. Are that your shoes? Certainly. Nice. - Own design. Are they also in size 381/2? Am I interrupting ? No, it is not. Virginia Chow from Shanghai. Dan Rackman, my boss. Pleasant. Who will have lunch with? Unfortunately I have a lunch appointment with Ms. Lee about strategy. Lots of fun. When I came here from China, everything was strange to me. Everything was 'wrong', of taste from toothpaste to the underpants. I was lonely. But I did not like it at the same time very exciting. Because everything was new and exciting. So I put my prejudices aside and let it come over me. Shall I tell you something very personal? Do you know what this means? 'Hands off. Private. " You want people to stay away from you. You do not know the pain of love. Can I have a Martini from you, Gilberto? For me too. I apologize for that comment. Are you married, Virginia? No, it is not. I do have a friend. - A Chinese ? No, he's American. But he paints his hair is black to look like me. We were married, but he had to separate for fiscal reasons. He travels a lot for his work. Tricky, you know. Now he is my boyfriend again. That is much more exciting. You talked about the pain of love. You must first fall in love to feel that pain. Have you suffered so much from love? - A little. My first husband was a bullfighter. I was seventeen. We made a school trip to Mexico. There was a bullfight in the Corrida. He was a star. He was great, you understand that. It took ten minutes. Marriage. When it was over, he was pierced in his crotch. Continue. In his testicles. First the left and then the judge went. I took care of him then. Imagine: cold fire. It was deeply tragic. I drank too much, Virginia. Love is just a neurotic concept. It is a thought of a man's world. Everything is running in this man's world to their hormones. Everything revolves around sex. A sexual obsession. It is just a compulsive neurosis, you understand? Yes, you mean that real love does not exist. It does exist. But it's not something that happens to you, but something that you have taught yourself. I'm just a bit sad, because love is something what I have never experienced before. But I can do everything about sex tell if you're interested. But we have only just met each other. What is stopping you ? Tell me. My god, what I look wild. Too wild for work. - I only think about sex. Is there something wrong with me? - Count on it. You can use the management toilet. - The management toilet? Okay, there we go. Do you always wear that? It is something new that I do trying it out. Do you like it? Very nice. Would you like to try it? - Yes. Which one? Where you wear it makes quite a difference. If you carry it on the right, you have a permanent relationship. And if you're wearing it on the left, are you available. You want me to do it for you? I'm so sorry. I do not know what inspired me. I do not know why that suddenly came to me. I did it, but actually you did it. You are a passive-aggressive type. I have never done that before. Your lips... are so soft. I have never kissed such soft lips. Do you like me ? Can I touch your breasts? Lyle, I'm coming. Oh, you are. - Are you expecting someone else? It is warm outside. Is this the kitchen? Why do not you call first? Do you have something cold for me? Yes of course. I love those things. So you met her. That Chinese. She can hear something about it, I hear. She was very professional. A professional whore? H , this is beautiful. What a view. Not bad at all. Do you have the paperwork? Take them for a moment. What kind of business did she have this time? A diving suit boutique? Shoes. Nice thought. Watch out, Alex. She is a seasoned scammer. Bruno has learned everything. You did not say they were married. - I'm just telling you what you need to know. I spoke with your boss Rackman. What do you say ? - I was with your boss. Quiet. He only knows what he needs to know. I said, "Rackman, do me a favor. Do not tell anyone. We want your employee Alex to give instructions. Tomorrow morning, in the city. " Bruno wants to have a bite with you tomorrow. It is at quarter to eleven in 'Modelina'. Make sure you are on time. So Bruno-land. Excuse me. That's my boyfriend. Boyfriend ? Finish that thing. Calm down. Her boyfriend ? - I'm Lyle. Have you been arrested? Tell. Reckless driving. It does not matter. Nice guy. I like that. That guy is disturbed. A weird. Is he a silent? You never guess. Something special has happened. You do not believe it, but I think I am in love. No, it's not my customer. It is a customer of the bank. I'm in my room and a little later I lie to make love on the toilet. It was not an issue of sex. It is... Ah, you know me. So a woman. Do you see that on me? - Not yet. But make love on a men's room? No. What's the problem ? With a woman. Nothing, though. Do you think I have such tendencies? Of course not. But what does it matter ? This is California Tea ? 500. Sex with an informant. She says something completely different. You can not just declare everything. Let's watch. She just lies. She is a sex maniac. I paid. Is that not allowed anymore? I always have to work out. You're fine, Tony. I do not question your approach. Okay? This is your new transmitter. Do not sweat like that. Then you get a short circuit. I really do not sweat. Bruno Buckingham is waiting for you in the Sapphire Room. I know everything about you, Alex. I have a question: what is your biggest wish? The World Bank. The World Bank is a disgrace. - Yes, but there is nothing else. I want to start in the Third World. Is that all ? I thought that you wanted Z rich. Sit down. Latin America is too trendy for me. I have a weakness for Asia and Asians. What's that film about that whore and that big financier? That's us. That is our story. Do you know who I am ? - Mr. 13 percent. Your driver said something like that. - The man is just a moron. Johanna, come here. You are a promise. A rough, unsharpened diamond, just like I used to. I offer you a finance course like you get that nowhere. It has something protective, something sexual and something psychotherapeutic. Is it yes or no? - Can I think about it? Yes that is allowed. - Fortunately. While you think. There is a... You can arrange a trifle for me. can you remember that Chinese, who does in shoes? Yes. No matter what they are called. I have some money for her. But you know that investors, especially foreigners, rather ... allergic to official rules and regulations. That money must be discrete find its way, you understand? Yes, I understand. Miss Chow knows that she is it liable if it suits? Of course. But with 169 million dollars will that be a concern to her. Where is the software? Give up. It seems nothing, hu? Have you heard that? from the Hiroshima virus? Is that the virus? Jee, I thought it was ... That it was a rumor, just like me? Do you have the work at your disposal? transaction codes from the Central Bank? Of course. Alex, you're a lucky ass. You will test the virus on the Bank's booking system. Test run, you say? - Just run. Tomorrow morning at 12 o'clock that entire network suddenly lifts up. The last booking is at 11.59. A booking from the Long Beach Pacific Bank ... amounting to $ 169 million. Including my 13 percent. And where? Ah, it will disappear somewhere in the dark. They never find out. Do you join? Good luck. Are you serious ? Do it, otherwise you'll regret it. Ai, this is ... It is the tension of the crime. You bet me. May I drink something ? Go ahead. So that is how the world sees it for high flyers. Hiro, this is a feminist. I like her. You kick it. You like extremes. It appeals to me. We have that in common with each other. I have to transfer this virus on a disc of your bank. I ask Mrs. Chow or them to be with you for an hour. Play it discretely. I will do that. Very discreet. I need to speak to you. - I'm coming. Not on the couch, but at the South Bay Opera House. What is it ? Do you regret that we have met? Yes, of course I'm sorry. Do they gossip about us on the couch? I feel them watching. And listen. But it goes not about us. It's about $ 169 million ... all of a sudden on your account stood just before I left. Has your financier or fiancée told you that you can get a prison sentence for that? Why ? Because I fucked you? Do you know what a scapegoat is? Yes, I know, but it will be a concern to me. You do what you do and I do not ask why. With me ditto ditto. Okay? Are you afraid ? My financier is not happening. He always saves. I fly. Everyone goes for the ax sooner or later. The scapegoat always happens. Are you afraid ? You said it. You have no one who you love. And no clothes on your body. What a pity. Did I say that? It's weird, though. Of love and you never have enough clothes. What do you think about it ? It is from 'Tosca'. You look like a whore of a hundred pesos. A whore of a hundred pesos? Do you know where I am This morning? I ate... Japanese in the Lexus Club. That is a brothel. That is not for you. I wanted to talk about that. I work as a call girl. Once in a while. I get 1500 dollars a night. I'm doing it for the money. On the couch ? - That would be my boss. I have some problems at once. I have a customer who thinks that he is in love with me. And I am in love with his ex-wife. Or his scapegoat, whatever they may be. An older customer has settled now raised as my ... as my sugar cream. He means it. Forget it. He always says that. Is that your only response? Bruno is disgusting. You have to get rid of him, even if you then ... Leave him, otherwise something will happen to you. Go away or go with me, but you have to get rid of that man. Let him be his dirty laundry correct yourself. How dare you ? How can you do such a thing? You fuck with me and with my husband? Are you sometimes retarded? I do not get well from you. What is that disgusting. Two tickets. I fly with the flight tonight from 12.55 to Guadalajara. I want you to come with me. I want you ... come with me. I can not do that. - Yes, you can. We're looking at the disc, but I think it's clean. Bruno has 18 hours to set up a virus. No, a memory algorithm. We pick up a virus like this. Well done, Tony. Make that computer first disconnected. We grab them and Bruno hangs. - We grab that Chow. We grab everyone. - Understood. Virginia, where have you been? I was worried. Where have you been? I love you. Go ahead, open up. Not now. We have to discuss matters. Fall dead. And my case? Because of your paranoia I sold it. Now I have nothing. Not even you. Stop. Do not be so neurotic. After tomorrow, it's allowed. You need me tomorrow. Mama mia, I forgot that. You should have thought that before you put your cock in her. You've got it too fucked in her ass. How did you get that idea? I hardly know that woman. Shall I tell you what? I think it's best. I have 169 million dollars on my bill. So look at it. I wish you would care. Do it now. You succumb under pressure. You have to rely on me. I do not want anymore. What are you doing ? What are you doing ? - I do not want anymore. Think about tomorrow. Think about the bank. You have to be in top form. Open the door. What are you doing ? Good, I know her. We were together. But it was business. It was strictly business. You will have to laugh about it. It's a hooker. I knew that. I knew it. Open that door. He is open. What are you doing ? What are you doing? Come on. Open that door. Open up. Do not do this to me. Do not look. Leave me. Do you want pills? What are you doing ? - I can take pills, too. Get out of here. And I thought I was nervous. Are you coming to the Midnight Hotel? I am nervous for tomorrow. You are I also feel nervous. Come to the hotel. Come without your driver, I think that's a creep. I have to leave. Make sure she indulges. - I'll succeed. It will be fine with her. You go. I'm with you. Good that I speak to you. - What is going on ? Are you alone ? Look, I'll give you space and you will become wild. Tomorrow is an important day. That crazy is just gone. Something happened here. My phone is being monitored and I have the Hiroshima flu. Do you understand ? Asian flu. Yes, yes, I get it. Hiroshima, h ? can you come here? Going to the Midnight Hotel? I'm coming. She let me down, Virginia. She tried to end it. Calm down, her stomach is now emptied. What happened ? - You and me. She feels it. She suspects something. So you sleep with her? - Slept. That is a long and sad story. You have to help me. - What about her ? Should not you help her? Yes. We must help each other. For Virginia, love, sex and venetian blind exchangeable. They are means of payment. And she has tendencies. Female tendencies. She was raised by the nuns. - Female tendencies? Do I look lesbian sometimes? Not at all. You do not have to do anything. A little flirt, give a good feeling. Tell us that we have nothing together. Care that she feels good. Attractive. Like women among themselves. She is attractive. How do I do that ? It's in the eyes. Come here. Imagine that I have eyelashes. I said that I do not want customers. It is the driver. Tell me what's going on. - That bastard. Look at that. What a device. You're a real professional, hu? I'm trying. - Look, plenty of liquor. My favorite place. So you have flu, hu? Come. That's right. We have to talk. You look hot. Hot and sick. - We have to talk about ... About us. I do not think your boss it is okay that you are so kind to me. That bastard? - He feels something for me. He offered me $ 20 to fuck that pathetic slit eye. As if I could. You are a completely different story. You look good today. Does it happen to anyone does not look good in your opinion? Come on, on the bed. Come on. What is it ? Are you high or something? Stay away from me. My career makes me high. This is my highlight. And yours. I feel very much for you. - Will we get this again? Asshole. I love it when you do so wildly. Delicious. Let's go to Hawaii. Or to Las Vegas. Nasty creep. Behind my back mess with my women? She made advances. - Eating a dirty piece. What did you say ? 'You are very nice'? 'I feel so much for you'? On the bed. You are fired. Give me the car keys. Do not deprive me, please. - Here's the keys. And your gun. I take that. Do not deprive me. I love this job. I am very good. Where is Virginia? Where is she ? - I did what you said. I've been locked in the car. In the garage. She's okay. I will kill you. - Give me the keys. I will kill you. I did what you said. Stay here. Sit down. You wanted to rape that gore jerk. I do not get that. Rape my prot g . And my feelings. I? Rape? - I'm insulted. I would never rape. Your feelings? Never. - Do you know what you get for that? Ten years, friend. Ten years in the cell. With a brute. A crazy brute. On your knees If you can not dismiss me. I love this job. Take the Trojan out of my pocket. The Trojan. Here, stupid. This bag. This ? Do you know what a Trojan was? A warrior, a man of honor. He does not betray any enemies, let alone friends. What do you mean ? Unpack. Do it. I will show you something. Do it well, lame. Do it well. Sit down. Do it. Do well. Hurry up. Careful. Otherwise I will hurt you. Finally justice. Stand up. Stand up. Put your pants down. Stay down. Did I say you can go? - Let 's go. See how Virginia is doing. What does this make sense? She stays here. If she goes, I shoot your balls off. She decides. Sit down. She decides. - You're the boss. Fortunately I am against the death penalty. After this no longer. I decide who is witness to executions. It must, Tony. - I'm not worth it. I am worthless. I do not close deals for love. You're going to fuck him to prove that you love me? Very masculine. - I'm it, your loyal Tony. Do you remember ? Tell him the truth, please. I did not rap you. Oh no ? This is what I call justice. Only now Bruno determines the law. That's why I can 'r. She is beautiful and smart. That's why she's mine. Do you understand ? If you can not dismiss me. I love this job. You are sad. You are retarded, let's be honest. And now ? - Stoop. You're not really going ... - You understand me well. Stoop. About that velvet case. Acorn, here. On the other hand. She listens to us. - I said I was against the death penalty ... but I can change my mind. - Come on, legs wide. From that Calvin. Take that Calvin off. I paid this. That's mine. You're crazy. You need help, Bruno. - I'm crazy, yes. Everyone wants to be that. This is not about sex. It's about power. I know a game. Are you lucky? Well? Yes, because you are good. You are lucky because you are horny. Do you feel that? You are so good. It is not what you think. - Whore. She is terrible. That I pay for this. - Not her. You, pig. I want to sit. Rest. It will be tomorrow a long day. Here is your homework. Leave me alone. I'll put it down there. - Let him leave. You want to be alone. - Take your boyfriend. I want a margarita. You work for me, do you remember? Go away, Tony. You heard her. What is it called here. - Absolutely. Very hot. Two margaritas. - I let me go. You're a burden. Sorry, it will not happen again. You want to tell me what is going on? I do not know that either. Everything is here. Everything that two guys need. Look at that. Drink, fresh limes. I am trapped in a spider web. - Lying spiders against each other? He said he loved me. Maybe you lie too. I never lie to you. Only to protect you. Do you believe me ? - I believe you. What time is it ? What time the flight go to Guadalajara. Are we still going? - Are you coming with me ? We're going to fly. I'm going to leave everything behind. I will do that. That is my job. Your loyal Tony. I'm thinking about it. Do not complain. - I'm not nagging. She has gone mad. She suddenly ran away. Go get it. Move. What is it? You get deeper and deeper into problems. Sit down. You are being cheated. Let's call it a trap. Whose ? - You should not ask me questions. Leave now that it is still possible. What is this ? Do you hear me ? Listening. Rat. Look at that mess. You can enter here L.A ... do not even get cigarettes. Then go live in Miami. There's a problem. Reed is evil. Rightly so. You are too nonchalant. You do not have your vest on. Do it now. - Do you have the .80? Bruno is there tomorrow. But those two strands are bothering me. I'll do that. Take it. The airport is closed. She can not forget in that Ferrari of 'r. Alfa Romeo. - She can use the pot with Alfa. Double-sided deceit. Two in a day. - You betrayed Virginia. Accidentally. - Tony is an agent and wants to be you. You're not going to kill him, are you? - Not me. Let him go. Let them all go. Money and love. And losing it. What is thirteen percent of how much? - 169 million. It's a sign. I am too old to pursue money. Time for a new beginning, Bruno. You should not fight it. Do you hear that ? Lyle, with me. You want me tonight to bring to the airport? Is it urgent? - Come to the back of my house. What time ? - At eleven o'clock. I'll be there. Come here. Where did you think goddamned to go? Where is he? - He found them. He found your channel. - What ? Goddamnit. And you did not give it to me? You know that for sure? Not really. - You are lying. You betrayed me, rotten. I hate you. I'm going through you. Klote Bruno. He's off, hu? I must have it, that bastard. Where is that floppy? - I do not know. Are you sure ? I break your neck. Say it. The bag is on the table. Then let's take a look. We're going to watch. You stay there. And do not move, otherwise I'll shoot you through your head, rothoer. You just have to do something ... I hope you do not lie to me. We will see it how it is with that floppy. This is it. You messed it up. Rotif. You wanted me dead. But I'm still alive. Do you see that ? And you are being caught. You go into prison. How about that? - Asshole. I'm going to fuck you. Come with me. can you remember me to the airport? This is not meant personally. I am paid for this. I did not pay you for it. It is personal. You have crossed over to Bruno country. You are finished. You're out of time, just like Elvis. Do you know what the French call this? A m nage trois. Come. It's an internal problem. Violence within the family. I am against incest. I am Catholic. I care about family values. I am from Cuba. - Not here. Let that bastard go. He's going, yes. - Shoot me from behind. If you want to. Shoot me. Then you will never be able to sleep ... until you get caught for murder of an F.B.I. agent. You wanted to go through the fire for me? Take this. You are fired. I wanted to let you go. But then I thought ... Screw you. I used to be just like you. Young. Fresh. There's my helicopter. Time is running out. We go. I have someone else. - Virginia can also join. Hello, Bruno. There will be two more passengers. Let's wait a bit. - We've been waiting for you. It's my sister. - We have to leave. Take a seat. Just in time ? Yes, I was lucky. We went to the south. First to Mazatl n and then by ship to China. I had the 375,000 dollars returned to Shanghai. After all, it was Virginia's money. That money would be enough for the shoe factory. A dollar is one dollar in Shanghai. Are you flirting? You're sure I'm Bruno. Here is your breakfast. Thank you. Are you hot? He reminds me to my first husband. You know, those ... I know who you mean. I have not forgotten that. I'm glad you can laugh about it. I am a woman with a past. Finally I make the switch to the Third World. I have somehow always known that I belonged there.
