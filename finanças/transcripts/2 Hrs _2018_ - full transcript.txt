Holby four-five-five. Control to eye in the sky. Reports of an intruder on a rooftop. Respond. Oi! You're nicked. Nice bit of artwork. Tim, what do you think you were playing at, to be brought home in a police car? Saved the bus fare. Don't you get smart with me. He can't be smart. He's an idiot. You be quiet. You're not helping. Oh, get that thing away! Mum, tell him! Don't listen to her, Monty. You'll hurt his feelings, and he will crawl into your room at night. Enough. Shona, bed. We don't want you exhausted for your big day. Well? Any explanation? What's the point? Right, that's it. You're going on that school trip tomorrow. But you said you were gonna write a note. And you said you were going to bed and not gallivanting 'round the city. You never would have done this before. Just once, I wish you'd think of the rest of us. What you do affects everybody. Seems like boys turn from gentle Jekyll to Mr. Hyde like they're switching sides. Do you have to do that? We're supposed to know it. Yeah, well, learn it silently. Like Two Face, this new face I see on the flip side I don't recognize... How can you not know it? I've heard it so much, even I know it. Seriously, look, you don't need to worry about the poetry comp. Yeah, you'll be crap anyway. Tim! What? Hey, Monty. Come on, love. Ignore him. You'll be fine. Why does he have to be such a dick? It's a boy thing. Tim, we're going. I'll get my folder. I've got to mow Mr. Nash's lawn. The Clements at 48 need the trees in their backyard cut down, but I'll be out after, straight after that. Yeah, but please don't be late, Mum. I won't. Tim. Willow has been rehearsing all night. She is so gonna beat you, Shona. Yeah, well, for your information, I've been up all night too. Have fun at the museum, losers. So, what does she mean? Thought you were bunking the snoozeum. Slight change to the old schedule. So you've got to go. And why are you laughing? You've gotta go too. At least we'll all suffer together, though. Alright, silver lining, check it. You are not gonna spray in the Natural History Museum. But we don't know the security arrangements. We don't know how many cameras. There's an infinite number of variables which need to be taken into account. It's okay, Alf. We don't need a risk assessment. It's exciting, isn't it? And silver lining two. Wow. Yeah! Used by U.S. marines. It's got the brightest... Oh, of course It's Georgia. She's, like, about 28. 17 in three months. Height? Five foot six. Bust? 34C. Star sign? Aquarius. For pity's sake. So, uh, plan, on the coach, we hole up at the back? And play Toasters versus Werewolves where no one can see us. Classic. If you wanna slack off and chillax, do it on your own time, eh, Timothy? Yes, miss. And Toasters versus Werewolves? That is so year six. You wanna be playing Misogynist Air Strike Three. Oh. And she's our responsible adult. Mr. Thompson. Mr. David Thompson. Sir, if you don't open the door, we'll be back with a court order. Mr. Thompson. I know he's in there. I can see him. Who was that, Daddy? Shh. Didn't I say that if you had the day off sick, then you could not get in the way? Now, Daddy has a very important day today, shh. Can I make cereal? Why don't you have some toast, love? We don't have cereal, do we? Fine! Hey, how you doing? My name is Mr. Lewis Groad. You can call me Mr. Lewis Groad. No, hang on. My name is Bond, James Bond. You can... okay. Hi, how you doing? My name is James. Hey, how you doing? My name is Mr. Lewis Groad. You can call me Lewis Groad. Mr. Lewis, oh, Jesus. Come on, Bond. I'm Bond, James Bond. You can call me James Bond. Soon be time. I bet we're both thinking the same thing. How many sausages can I fit in my mouth? What? No. Oh. This could be the big story that saves our skins at the paper. Do you want a... Yeah, go on, then. Ah. Look what you've done. Sorry, sorry. - Stop it! - Are you alright, though? - What do you think? - Whoa! Look at me. And the Diplodocus, also known as Dippy, is, of course, extinct. This great hall was bequeathed to the museum by a rich philanthropist who wanted to be remembered. Gather round, gather round. Any questions? If you can tear yourselves away from your phones. "That's interesting, Miss Halliday. "You've made me want to work with fossils, Miss Halliday. "Thanks for being so knowledgeable," or even, "That's a nice blouse, Miss Halliday." Just give me something. My therapist says it's great for my self-esteem to get positive validation. Over sharing again, Rachel. Maybe we should go back. What do you think? This must go deep under London. This is so gross. Are they dead? Whoa. Maybe we should just crash your sister's slam poem thing at the school. Why? It's like she's here already. Mean. The chances of this working out in our favor are very slim. I'm just saying. Come on. This is way too spooky. Freaked out now. We could actually be trespassing on London Underground property now. We are like 100 miles away from the museum. Oh, Alf, stop wittering. Wow, that's one of those marine ones. You never said you had that. Ow, what was that for? I don't like this. I don't like this at all. We're lost. We're definitely lost. It's fine, Alf. Listen. That does not sound good. Guys! - Who was... - No idea. I'm not gonna ask. I'm scared. Here... Let's get out of here. Ladies and gentlemen. Pay attention. This number will become relevant in a moment, so please remember it. Please meet, from New York, my sponsor, Mr. Lewis Groad, the billionaire who has funded my revolutionary research. And the light refreshments. Well, that's three canapes per person. Although there seems to be quite a few, so maybe make that two canapes per person. I must ask for there to be no photographs. We don't wanna see any of this making its way onto the internet. You understand? If I see a camera or a phone, I'm gonna kill you. Metaphorically. No, no, no, I mean it. I'm gonna kill you. No, seriously, folks, a real pleasure to say, hi, how you doing, y'all, from New York City. Ladies and gentlemen, in life, what is the one question that every person wants answering? Uh, what time's lunch? I was looking for something a little more philosophical. What is lunch? A little more? Does lunch exist? It's nothing to do with lunch. Forget lunch. Lunch is not part of this. No, as the years fly by, one question starts to take precedence, the question, "how long do I have left?" What if you could find out? Now... ...you can. What I'm going to show you today is a breakthrough in scientific technology, something that has never ever been done before, something mankind has dreamed of for thousands of years. This is the culmination of my life's work, 30 years of hard research. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Vitalitron. Welcome to the Vitalitron capsule, providing the authoritative analysis and prediction of Earth based organic matter. It can predict the longevity of any living creature. It assesses over 30 parameters, weight, height, cellular age, metabolic rate, blood pressure, et cetera. Full details are in the leaflets, and then it makes an exact prediction of the time of death of that organism, and now a demonstration. When we started this presentation, it had four minutes left to live. Critical organ failure expected in 10 seconds. Three, two, one, and life form is extinct. Predicted to the second. Confirmation of major organ failure. No pulse detected. Time of death confirmed at 12:14 P.M. Any questions? Do you have any vol-au-vents? Not you. Have you ever tested it on a human? That would be unethical... apparently. Well, do you wanna test it on my colleague? What? I am not testing it... No, no, test him, my colleague. I am not testing it on anyone. Well, I'll do it if he does it. See, we can do it together. How would that even work? He could sit on my lap? It will only take one reading at a time. Now might be a good time to explore the buffet. Yes. Let's say goodbye to Mr. David "Oh, look at how much money you owe us. "You're a pathetic human being and a bad father," Thompson, and then say, well, hello there, Mr. Lewis, "Welcome to my dick dickety doo dah "private members' drinking club "in downtown New York City," Groad. You are not serious. Come on, man. I'm not turning it on. Just get out now. You can't know when you're gonna die. What does it matter? Just press it. All systems are go. Building jigawatt battery. It might microwave him. We are transferring from grid power to battery reserve. Calculating weight and cellular age. What on earth? He should not be in there. Yep? We've got a situation here, Mr. Groad. Someone's inside the Vitalitron. How did that happen, Lena? Did you leave the machine switched on? Cell analysis data now complete. DNA molecule match now in progress. Results due in three, two, one. Oh, my word. Well, how long have I got, then? You've got two hours left to live. Well, it's obviously... failed. That can't be right, can it? Guys. This is the conclusive test that we've needed. Nothing's gonna happen to me. But does it predict accidents, though? What if Tim walked under a bus before the two hours is up? I'm still here, thanks. I suppose I'm saying if he had an accident now, would he linger and then finally die in in two hours? Really? If he goes under a bus, he dies sooner than in two hours. He's not indestructible. Lena, how are the calculations looking? The temporal calculations seem accurate, Mr. Groad. Looks like we'll soon have the ultimate validation. Fantastic. Fantastic? If it's true, Tim will be dead. Ah, sure, okay, that was very crass and very insensitive of me, and for that I, hey. Hey, wait a minute. What are you guys doing here? School trip to the museum? This ain't no museum. We went on a bit of a wander. Hey, hey, hey, where you going? Lena. Lena! This is epic. And it's vital you kids stay here, as I need to monitor your progress over the course of the next two... ...hours. Stop them. Hey, you, you, stop them! I will pay you $100,000 each to catch them. Hey, this way. Keep up. What do we do when we catch them? I don't know, but I want that money. They're just out through that hatch. God dang. I think I broke my coccyx. Shut up. This could be the ultimate test of the machine, but the boy has gone rogue. Now, we need to get him back. You understand me? Lena, those idiots better find him, Lena, 'cause if he does not die as predicted, then it is the end of the funding. It will be the end of you. Nobody is gonna buy this machine if it is not correct 100% of the time. It will be. And if it is not correct 100% of the time, then its use as a diagnostic tool... Do you understand me? Is he going to die? And you're sure you don't feel ill? You know, it's not gonna be true. Well, the Victorians had parlor tricks where they'd summon the dead, but it was just that. It was a trick. That was a real press conference. She was a real scientist. That thing was real. You need to tell your mum. Oh, great idea. She'll just think I'm lying to get out of the school trip. So what are you gonna do? What do you mean? Well, you can't just do nothing for two hours. It'd be just like every other two hours of your life. Oh, great, so mum says I'm selfish, now you're saying I'm lazy. Do stuff, stuff you've always wanted to do. That way, even if the machine's wrong, you still get to do some great things. What have you got to... ...lose? Please tell me I'm not the only one who can see that. Course we can see him. If you want a photo, it's 10 quid. Maybe I should be thinking of something. Is that a no? Charming. Get me out. Come on, mate. Come on. I can't face it. I really don't wanna go to my auntie's this morning, not now. Why do you need to see your aunt? Oh, I left my science homework book at hers last night. Why do you need to do your science homework? I'm just saying. That's a bit harsh. Nothing's gonna happen to him. Thanks for the support, guys. Look, can one of you just go and knock on the door? She lives right here. Just tell her I told you to pick up the green science book. It's on the kitchen table. Right, okay, I'll go. I feel bad now. Thanks, Vic. You're a true friend. We're just gonna wait down here so she doesn't notice I'm here. Okay. Oh, sorry, wrong house. That's not funny. Yes, it is. Guys, I know what we can do. Bucket list. What's going on it? Break into Gamer Shed and nick some games. When will you have time to play them? If you die. Yeah, and it can't be anything illegal, anyway, 'cause we're still around to take the rap. If you die. What is the point of doing a bucket list if you can't do cool, illegal stuff? Well, you don't have to do anything illegal. There must be other things you've always wanted to do. I don't mean to rush you, but... Okay, drive with Lewis Hamilton. Yeah, okay, probably a bit hard to arrange in two hours though. 94 minutes. Alf. Okay, let's just park Lewis Hamilton, and say, how about having a drive with... ...with my dad? Would he be dressed as Lewis Hamilton? Would you like him to be? Okay, um... climb a mountain. Better. Not many mountains in this part of London, though. Hi. I'm fine. Nervous, but I'm fine. Yeah, I know, brave and heart and all that. See you later. You will be on time? Won't you? Okay. One, I wanna get over my fear of heights. Write it. Fear of heights. Two, I wanna kiss a girl. Which girl? Oh, not just any girl. She's like a 10 on the hotness scale, Georgia Miston. Georgia Miston? She's an 11, man. Beyond the scale, seismic. Good grief. Three, I wanna throw up some graf. Number three, throw up some graf. Four, I wanna be Steve McQueen in that movie where he rides that motorbike. Put "ride a motorbike." Motorbike. Vroom. Done. You happy now? Bucket list, ah hah. That one. Just step on that ledge. It is theoretically possible without dying. Alf. Yay, you can do it, man. There he is up there. He's gonna toss himself off. Slight problem, Mr. Groad. He's gonna kill himself. Well, stop him. They look like they're trying to make him jump. What sort of friends are they? He wants him alive. Come on. Oh, go on. Remind me whose bright idea this was. Sometimes you just have to go for it and do the thing that really scares you. It's fine. Look. Whoa. Hold it! What is it exactly that you want from us? Calm down. Everyone calm down, and we can have a nice cup of tea. Do young people still drink tea? You can have an orange squash in one of those carton things. Yeah, or perhaps, one of those still, cloudy lemonades. I mean, they're very popular. Bottom line, we need you to come back to the demo. Go away. Come back to the demo room, or I'll tell your mum. Hang on. That's made me sound six years old. I'm not. I can drive and go out with girls and everything. Does your mum know you've got a time limit, Tim? Yeah. Well, you're a bigger man than I am. I couldn't tell my mum a thing like that, oh, see the look in her eyes. Didn't she plead to be with you, Tim? Didn't she wanna spend those last remaining... Okay, I'll come. I flunked the first thing on the list anyway. Go on. Good boy. Well, that was easier than I thought. Yeah. Run for it! Oi! What? No, of all the underhanded, snide... How did they know about the list? Who cares? I've gotta find Georgia Miston. 72 minutes. Right, next on the list, kiss a girl. Shut up. No more Mr. Nice Guy. Next time we grab the kid. Next time we'll just grab you. Hello, hi. Shona. When you see your brother, you tell him I was not impressed that he went AWOL at the museum. Not coolio. No, Miss Forrest. Shouldn't you be coming in? You'll be on stage soon. - Are you excited? - Nervous. That's the spirit. Organic life form has exited the capsule. Unable to complete monitoring analysis. This is most unusual. Connection to online network lost. Look, don't worry. Just 'cause you bottled one thing doesn't mean the other stuff won't work out. Georgia's in there. The mammal tour will be starting in the blue zone in 15 minutes. I didn't think it would be this easy. You seemed so, I don't know, heartfelt. To be honest, I get a lot of guys saying they're gonna die, but most of them are lying just so they can, you know? What was different about me? You're such a talented graffiti artist. I am, aren't I? And the way you put zero for every answer on that maths test as a protest against capitalism blew my mind. Did you know that I also wrote Indian swear words all over my... Shhh. Come on, just kiss my face off. Can we sit here? Ladies and gentlemen, the velociraptor show will begin in 10 minutes. He needs a plan. Has he got a plan? You got a plan? Yeah. He hasn't got a plan. - Ooh. - Rookie error. No one wants to see that. Hi, Georgia. This may sound kind of dumb, but can I kiss you? No. That went well. She doesn't wanna kiss him. Why are you pleased? I'm not... pleased. You were pleased. There was a definite satisfaction in your... Oh. What are you... This is epic! It's not epic. Well, does he know? Do you know? You know, but he doesn't know, and now I know. Oh, no. Shut up about knowing, okay? Well, how are we gonna find them? I don't know. Chase them at high speed? Oh, I forgot. You had to make sure we had travel sweets and that I was sitting properly, so we lost them. My Auntie Gladys said it never helps if you lose your temper. Focus. We know exactly what he's doing. What's number two on the list? Kissing Georgia. Aw, kissing Georgia, but we don't know where he's doing it. Probably on the mouth. Just think. Where does a kid like that meet this Georgia? Is it at work? Probably not. He doesn't have a job, so could she be a friend of his sister's? Yes! She's too young to know anyone he'd be interested in at that age. So, that leaves... Internet dating. More likely, he covets what he sees every day. The Bible. Hannibal Lecter. He knows Georgia from school. He sees her every day, and where are most of his school today? Uh, yeah, I know this. Mu... The mu... Mus... Muesli. That's a food. Oh. What would they be doing at a food? Oh, a muesli... Muesli shop? Just drive. Muesli, a muesli and... Stop talking. That's okay. You're learning. Oh, God, he's going in again. - Stay here. - Wait, wait. What are you gonna do? - Are you still here? - He's still here. Fact is, he won't be for much longer. Good. He won't be 'cause he'll be gone. Dead. I've got 60 minutes left to live. Right, come on. Put your hood up and grab him. I'm not a child snatcher. I think that's illegal. I'll tell the police it's in the kid's best interest as we have to get him to a hospital, okay? Now, hurry up. His best interests? Uh huh. Why would you say that? Why would he say that? 'Cause it's true. Look, you'll have lots of times in your life when you can kiss a boy. I'm sure they'll all be great, but the bottom line is this is it for him. He's never kissed a girl before. I have. Have you? We're kind of losing the heat here. Can... Well, he's probably never kissed a girl before, and for some reason he wants to kiss you. I don't know why, but he doesn't wanna die without doing that... thing. Hey! Come on, then. Got to admire roping in a friend and making up that trash. Hey, she's my girlfriend. What are you doing, you jerk? What are you doing? You don't own me. Where's Alf? I'm not Tim, you moron. Even he knows that. Oh, it's ringing. Give it. Hello, Tim. What do you want? Listen up. I've been given carte blanche, which means do whatever the hell I want in French, to bring to bring you back, Sonny Jim, and if that means eggs have to be cracked and omelets have to be... Hey! You let the boy escape. Idiot. You... Come here. Hey, stop that. Here he is. What did you do that for? What? Say all that stuff to Georgia. 'Cause you were doing so well on your own. Quickly, they'll be after us. Come on, then. Seems like boys turn from gentle Jekyll to Mr. Hyde like they're... You're so going to win, Willow. Apparently Shona doesn't even know her poem yet. Come on. Stop it. Grow up. So had you really? What? Kissed a girl. I don't think they saw me, but we haven't got long. We haven't got long. Can't even do a bucket list. Two big fat failures. Why didn't I just grab her and kiss her? Probably 'cause that would have been assault. It's not like there's time to send me to prison. It's all slipping away, isn't it? - In one hour from now... - 54 minutes. Alf! I thought accuracy was important. This is useless. I'm useless and selfish. Mum was right. What's the point? There it is. There's that can-do attitude of yours that I just love. There's still time. Come on. There are two more things on that list, even without the kissing a girl thing, and, you know, there are ways around that... ...if you're... I think we should move on to the next thing. Alf. You wanna do at least one last graf. Yeah. Okay, so here's a brick wall. You could show me how you make the stencil. Vic, maybe this isn't the best one. It smells of... I can find a better wall. Whatever. Wait here. Oh, there are loads of walls. Yeah, that's the trouble with cities, isn't it? Right, we concentrate on the streets in the immediate vicinity of where we saw them last, round here. They're teenagers, inherently lazy. They'll use the first wall they can to put up some graf. Or, there's another possibility. He said he wanted to throw up some graffiti, hm? Yeah. But who said it would be on a wall? - I don't... - Oh, just come on. Oh, Tim, come on. Ow, what was that for? I'm trying to knock some sense into you. Listen, by the looks of it, Alf's just got into that gallery, so you can throw up some graf. How awesome is that? It's pretty cool. Come on. Trust us. What's the worst that could happen? Stop. The whole place is probably alarmed. Breaking that window probably tripped it already. Probably? Definitely now. Come on. Hurry up. Lifeform organic cell matter degeneration now at 70%. Confusion and disorientation highly probable. Okay, this is the nearest one. Bingo. This is perfect.

The owner doesn't need to know all that, does he? Now, whoa, wait a minute. We're journalists. Journalists? He's right.

I'm not your hired heavy. Alright, shut up. We need to get in there. It's all wet on my underside. Be quiet. That's one thing off the list. Oi! You, take off stencil. You just hook your nails underneath. She do it, not you with your... hair. Okay, alright. Perfect. What is this? Oh, it's all about time. You've got this bit here. You've ruined my work. Your work? Explain before I kill you. You know what? This is the last painting I'm ever gonna do anyway. That's before you came in here with your bat and your accent and your threats, so hey. What is he talking about? I've only got 30 minutes left to live, so I took a bit of a risk to try and get some of my art into a gallery in my lifetime. I'm sorry, but you must have done some risky things, right? What do you know? We don't know anything. Art's supposed to provoke some kind of response, and doing this has already got a response. You hate it, and you wanna kill me, and that is all good. Paint the others. I'm allergic if it comes into contact with my skin... No, not them, you idiot. The other canvases. I don't have time, but I can give you the sten... Seems like boys turn from gentle Jekyll to Mr. Hyde. I've gotta go. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You can't just go! You did it. Motorbike next. No. Sorry. There you are! Come here! Grab him. Moore Auction House, please. Oh, not again. You can do this, Tim. Let us in. Open this door! Let us in. You have to do it. You're right. Yay, Tim's done another thing on his list. Alf! Grab the boy. Come here, you. I'm sorry. Seems like boys turn from gentle Jekyll to Mr. Hyde. Hello? How are you feeling? How did you get my... pushed for time. I know. It's vital you come back here. Can you save my life? I have a serum that could prolong your life. Could? I need definite, otherwise I'm wasting time. Hi, this is Tim. You know what to do. Shona? Understood. Okay, Mr. Groad wants to know where Tim's gone. He's off the list, isn't he? I've got Tim's number. How did you get his number? They got my phone. Now, I could call him, but I doubt he'd tell me, don't you? He did just abandon you. It's not his fault. He's not been the same since his dad. All he cares about is himself. One of his school reports has the word selfish in it eight times. Miss Halliday would have used it too, but she went for self-obsessed to be different. We can stay here for as long as it takes, but I'm almost certain you'd rather be with him when, well, you know. So where is he? School is really boring. End up in lectures, just snoring. Wondering why... Remember, the hardest thing about public speaking is imagining the abject humiliation if you fail. Thanks for the advice, miss. She'd better be right. Ah, Mr. Groad. Yeah, his sister's gone to some poetry thing. We're pretty certain that's where he is. Okay, get after him. We're running out of time. Don't worry. We're on our way. Good. It appears they've caught him. The boy's heading to his school, so I can get the journey to bring him in. Don't worry, I'll go. You sure you can handle this on your own? He's a child. Just need to give him a bit of TLC. I'm surprised you even know what that stands for. Of course I do. We have to handle this sensitively to avoid a PR nightmare. We must show concern. I'll be the model of humanity... as long as he dies on time. Time of death predicted, 19 minutes, 36 seconds and counting. You stupid... what are you crying for? It's a moped. Ow. Hey, hey, are you okay? I didn't see you. You just ran out. Hey! There's no time to wee, I'm afraid. Oh, I don't need to. No, not you, me. Oh, go, go, go. And remember, don't be useless. Willow Graves scores nine from the judges. Go Willow, you buried them! I'm going to perform a poem. It's about my useless brother. I lost the... Gonna try from memory. Seems like boys turn from gentle Jekyll to Mr. Hyde like they're switching sides. Perfect. Seems like boys turn from gentle Jekyll to Mr. Hyde like they're switching sides. But he didn't go to the dark side. He just went to the dick side. Like Two Face, this new face I see on the flip side, I don't recognize... 'Cause I used to have a brother who played Connect Four with me, balloon off the floor with me. And now I've got this monster, selfish giant or ogre who just doesn't care. Never helping Mum, shrugging so passively, actually causing us grief, like he wants to make us suffer it, and we've had enough of it. It's time he looked up, started seeing. And turned back into a human being. You deserve a better brother. I'm sorry, but I want you to know, I'm really proud of you. After a shaky start, Shona Edge has scored a perfect 10. Enjoy it. At the 15 minute mark, heart rate will elevate to 100 bpm. Oh, God. Yes? Your services aren't required. Wait, what? Mr. Groad is no longer in charge. He views this whole thing as some sort of scientific exercise. I kept telling him "a boy's life is at stake here." But we had instructions. What's going? Change of plan. Back to the lab. So is this how I die, then, from being hit by a car? I have no idea. Something is going to kill you. You've got a great bedside manner. The main thing is, I can help. I've got a team of doctors waiting. - Really? - And the serum I mentioned, it's gonna put a stop to this. But how can it? Do you really have time for a lecture on biochemical nanotechnology? Well, thanks a bunch. Ticked me off the list. You didn't care, did you? If I hadn't gone, my sister would have thought I was trying to ruin... What has that got to do with it? I wasn't doing my list. I had Shona's poem. I took it this morning without her knowing. I can't be selfish all my life, can I? Is that how I'm gonna be remembered? Take care of Monty for me. He eats most things, especially sausages, and he tends to get really narky if there's too much light around. Finished? You've got a motorbike? Evidently. Well, there's one thing on my bucket list that I haven't done. Tim? What the... Victoria, what's going on? It's Tim. He's dying. What? In 14 minutes. ♪ Whoa ♪ ♪ You cannot always hit the road ♪ ♪ It wasn't mine until the no show ♪ ♪ Hold your breath and watch it unfold ♪ ♪ Oh no, oh no ♪ ♪ You were smoke and mirrors from the get go ♪ ♪ Run me right into a freak show ♪ ♪ Strike a match and watch the breeze blow ♪ ♪ Oh no, Oh no ♪ You'll get us killed.

This is my laboratory. It's better if it's just the two of us. But you said there were gonna be doctors, and if we go to a hospital, they'll have all the right gadgets and... I think I wanna go. Are you sure? Yay. What are you doing? Waiting. Look, I'll take the serum, alright? I may have lied a bit. There is no serum. Well, what's... This is a traceless neurotoxin, just insurance, in case you don't die on time. Eight minutes and counting. This is the way we know to the building. Plan B. You are our first official human test. The machine must be proved right. This machine will change the world. Everyone born in the future will get their own expiry date. The Long Lives, that's what we'll call them, can plan ahead properly. The Short Lives, well, the world will know not to waste valuable resources on them. That's just wrong. Bereavement won't be such a shock. Couples can get married knowing that they'll be together for an exact amount of time. The phrase "'till death do us part" can be replaced with a date. How cool is that? I wouldn't wanna know when someone I love is gonna die. But you could plan. We went to the beach day before my dad died. No one knew that was gonna be the last time, so... we had a great time. It's not right to know. Are you sure this is the quickest route to the other building? It's the only way I know. Lena, what on earth are you doing? Why is he tied up? Just call it an insurance policy. He's not Frankenstein, you crazy woman. You want this machine to be proven just as much as I do. This is not right. We can't do this, Lena. Man up. You're fired. The sound on this is really bad. A few moments left. We could play I Spy. What am I supposed to do? I can't stop it. It's not the machine that's gonna kill him. Mr. Groad, hello, sir. I need you to terminate the demonstration in Room 101. Sorry, sir. Miss Eidelhorn sent everyone home about 30 minutes ago. What? Yes, sir. I was just on the way out the door myself. Okay, what's your name, son? Kevin, sir. Now, you listen very carefully to me, Kevin. Lena has to be stopped at all costs. What do we do? You look for a crowbar. I'll find another way in. I can pick the lock. What do you mean, you can pick the lock? I've got tools. Oh. It's locked from the inside. The science woman, she's gone rogue. She's gonna kill your friend. How do I get back to the car? Follow me. Where are you parked? Stay there. Do not move. Go on, please. - Yes. - Yes! Wow, is that a chainsaw? Why am I attracted to a woman with a chainsaw? Give me back my son. No can do. Mum. Critical organ failure expected in 20 seconds. 10 seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, and life form is extinct. Organ cell deterioration and rigor mortis will set in in four hours. Time of death confirmed at 14:30 P.M. Greenwich Mean Time. This is the 17th successful test of the Vitalitron capsule. The capsule now discharging battery power back to the grid. ♪ Tim's alive ♪ ♪ I'm so happy ♪ ♪ Tim's alive ♪ Look out! Time I did something nice for Tim. What are your feelings, Mr. Groad? Well, I want you to know that when I hired the woman, her credentials were absolutely impeccable, and I just realized you're talking about the machine, ain't you? Well, there's no denying it's a setback, but, hey, come on. It's great the kid survived. And why do you think it didn't work? What's that? What? Is that something in your pocket, or are you just pleased to see me? What? I thought I felt a rattling. He's not growling. I'm sorry. Don't you see what this means? He was in my pocket when I was scanned. You can't scan two things at once. I said that. Brilliant. The machine was not wrong. Amazing. So we can continue the testing. Hey, when I did rehire you? But surely... You were prepared to kill the boy to validate the machine. You were even gonna implicate me in your disgusting, stinking little scheme. The police are coming. Thank you. It was a real pleasure to meet you, Miss Chainsaw Lady. Don't even think about it. Anything? Huh, I just don't know how it didn't record. Hm, it's almost like incompetence. I have never wet myself. Oh, look. There it is. Look, right in there. Look, look, look. Ow. We're gonna have to get another interview. Shona won the competition. I was so proud of you both. I've been mean to her since Dad... I'm so sorry he's not here. I know I can't be your dad, but I will always be your mum. He's part of all of us. He always will be, and it's fine to talk about him whenever you want. Yeah. I thought you might want a keepsake. A bucket list? We didn't do anything illegal, but... Am I going to get letters? I'm really sorry about Monty. I know I hated him, but I'll help you throw a small funeral if you like. Reconnecting to online network. Data mining analysis now complete. Discovery of second life form.
