- The last time I saw Sadie, she was lying in a hospital bed. Her lips doing that unconscious flapping sound that comes with the snore of someone who's no longer there. A tube down her throat. Machines screaming at us in the hospital room. But the last time we spoke, it was a couple of months before. Too long. And she told me I was a great big brother. I wasn't. I was okay. She told me she loved me. I told her the same. I think we both knew this was our last chance. It occurs to me now, after all we'd been through, 39 years as brother and sister, we were just two little kids who were just scared outta their minds. And after all this time, we still had each other. We love you, Sadie. God, we miss you. - I can't. - I know. - I can't look at it anymore. - Okay. Jason, um, Sadie's stuff, back at the house, the bed, the meds, all that shit, can you just- - I'll take care of it. Clean it up. - Thank you, thank you. - It's okay, I think that's about all your car and take. - Yeah. - Where'd your parents go? - They need me to take care of Sadie's stuff. I just don't think mom can handle seeing it after all this. I dunno. - Look who I found. - Hey, kiddo. - Hey, Dad. - You ready to go, Maggie? - Anytime you're ready. - Hey, are you all right? - Yeah. - Jason. - Hi. You came. - Of course. - For this? - Yeah. - Wow. - I left a card in the, the thing, with my cell on it, if you wanna call. I mean, no, no pressure, just if you want to. I leave in the morning. - Hello. Yeah, it's, uh, it's Jason. And I was wondering if you, if you wanted to, like, if you wanted to come to the, if you just wanted to come to the house? Great. Okay. Yeah. I'll see you then. Yeah, see you soon. Whoa, wait! Uh, I just, I have to do a bunch of cleaning, if that's okay? It's just, you don't have to do anything. It's just, uh, you can just watch. Is that? Okay. Okay, great. I'll see ya then. Yeah. Hello? Hi, Mrs. McVee. It's Jason. No, it's Jason. It's J- No, it's Jason! Yes! Hi. Yeah, they're, no, they're at my, they're staying at my place tonight. Yeah, you know, but you don't, you're, it's okay, that's okay. You are going to be fine. I'm gonna tell them you called, okay? Holy shit! - Holy shit, yourself. - I feel like I'm in a time machine. - Yeah. Except, I never used to knock. - That's true. Yeah. Oh, come in, come in, yeah. - I always loved this house. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, something about it. - Well, a lotta ghosts here. Can I take your coat? - Yeah. Why thank you, sir. - Uh, but of course. - Still fits. - Can I get you a drink? Uh, we don't have any of your beloved Canadian. - What? - I know. Sorry, I just. Yeah. - What is this place, some kind of a palace? - Just a craft brew quality, sorry. - Uh. Thanks. You don't look like a hipster. - I guess just deep inside somewhere, it's just clawing its way out. - Well, you do have the beard for it. - You know, contrary to popular belief, hipsters did not invent the beard, so. - Are you sure about that? - Yeah. - I don't know, they make a pretty good case for it. - No, everyone knows the beard was invented by Canadian iconic '70s rock band, "Prism". - Yeah, I don't think did. - No, I think it was the cool one. It was like, yeah. What's his name? Hi. - Hi. I'm... I'm sorry. - Thanks. - I, I don't know. - Me neither. I mean, I'm sure I'll, I'll be like actually grieving at some point, but right now, I just feel like I'm living in this, this rubbery feeling of her being gone. - Yeah. I get that. - I am glad today is over, though. - Oh, I bet. - Yeah, I'm pretty tired. It was a lot, a lot leading up to this. They just kept poking and prodding and running the clock until the buzzer went. It's like it was just fucking humiliating. She just fell through the gap. - I'm so sorry. - Thanks. So you wanna get fucked up? Help me clean some stuff up? - Hell yeah. - Pain meds. Anti-seizure meds. Like, just pretty much anything. - Whoa! Pain meds, huh? - Mm-hmm. - That could be interesting. Does it all have to go? - No, yeah, it does, it all has to go. Yeah. All of it. - Wait, before we get super drunk and high on oxy. - Yeah. - Put that down. - Why? - Do you have a car? - Yes. - Grab the keys. - Okay. What are, what are we doing? - Stop asking questions and just come with me. - Um. Yeah, what are... Where, where are... Okay, hey, wait. - What? - Come on. - All right, fine. - These will literally make you piss yourself. - Well, you choose your party, I choose mine. - All right. - I always thought that was the coolest building too. - Ooh, the Country Music Club. I have this foggy memory of walking in there. - And if it's foggy, there really is a good chance you did go in there. - Yeah. Yeah. - Like, I just wanna go over to him and like cinch up the one side of his backpack to straighten it up, really badly. Like I really badly wanna do that. It's terrible. - Does anybody ever sit in the passenger seat and just look at you? - Yeah, you know who does that? Narcs. - Oh! - You a narc? - Maybe. - Fuck, she didn't even, you're just like, you're just like- - It's been a few years. - Wow. - Ready? The cold gonna be enough? - Probably. - Not for me. Thanks for bringing this for me. - Yeah, I was, I'm done, I've had enough already. - Hold on the railings. Whoa! Shit! - Actually, no joke. - Oh my God, that was fun. Holy shit! It's still here. - Mm-hmm. We have to sneak onto it. - Oh yeah, goddamn right. - Okay. - Shh. Mm. God, I haven't been here since, um, well, since you. - Shut up, you're ruining it. I actually brought you here to explain to you the beneficial glory of this community I've joined. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. We're called The Flowers of Utopia. And we're led by a raccoon named scott, with the lowercase S, 'cause we're all equal. - My God, that sounds amazing. - Oh, you don't know the half it. Every month, scott asks us to make a sacrifice of something. - Uh, that makes sense. You gotta prove your love. - Lately, I've been... Okay, don't tell anyone this, but lately I've been giving him my body. - So you give scott the raccoon your body, like, like sexually? - Yeah, what else would I mean. Technically, he said if I didn't, then I would have to go to the roots of our hell tree and live out my days. - Hell tree? - Yeah, our hell tree. So, I give myself to scott, lowercase S, the raccoon once a month, just to be safe. - Well, if it makes you feel better. - It does, I does. - Does, yeah. - Not the sex, though, 'cause he's a raccoon and his nails are sharp. - Right. Yeah. - I figure as long as I got my rabies shots, I'll be fine. Don't want one of those animal STDs. Safe sex is the best sex. - That's a good point. So, if I was to join your group, would I do the same thing, or- - Oh God, no. No, no. Sex with scott, lowercase S, is for high-level followers only. - Right. - You'd have to start from the bottom, cleaning our toilets and trimming scott's nails. Which, I would appreciate considering the amount of fingering he likes. - Oh, you're so fucked. Oh my God. - I know. - I missed you. - Missed you too. - I can't believe I never made out here. - Uh, speak for yourself. I made out here constantly. - Oh, are you referring to Devon? Okay. I'm not entirely sure that he existed, so. - What? - I never met him. - Uh, he stayed in Ontario, he only visited me a couple of times. - Okay, sure. - He did. - Yeah. No. I mean, well, there's no way to know for sure, so. - You met him. - Okay, you know what? I actually met someone who you said was Devon, but- - That was Devon. - Yeah, okay. - That was Devon. - You know, to be fair, you never made a move on me, so. - Right. This is nice. God, I miss this view. - Yeah, me too. - How many people out there, across the water, you think are having sex right now? - Well, I, I don't think anyone. - Why not? - They've all got this, like, just feeling, deep in the back of their minds, they can't quite put their fingers on. It's, um, creepy, strange woman on a boat is thinking about them naked. - Come on- - So you killed their mojo. - No. What? - That's what you did. - No. Now I feel bad. - You should, you really should. - God, think of all the babies that could have been made. - I know, you're so selfish. - No, maybe, maybe they were meant to not be conceived. Maybe these kids would've grown up to be assholes or dictators, or asshole dictators. - Kids are not you. - Threatening to take over the world. - Yeah, you're rationalizing. - I'm sorry, you guys! I'm sorry for taking away your mojo! Keep going, and don't mind me! I'm not paying any attention at all! Unless you want me to, then I am, you dirty, sick fucks! Aah! - Are you finished? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - I just wanted to be clear. You, you were clear. - You know, I think they appreciated it. - What would they do without your permission to copulate? I can't even imagine. - I did them a favor. They're probably having the best sex of their life. - Yeah, no, okay, I take it back, you being selfish. You're a real giver. - Yes. - What does your husband think about you coming out here? - No questions asked. - That's, that's really nice of him. - Yeah, he's a really nice guy. - So, he just like- - Yep. - So you guys have a really, you have a good like... So you happy, you? - Yeah. Yeah, we are. Whatever that means. - Good. - There's something I need to tell you. - Okay. - But, you, you have to promise that you won't think any less of me or look at me any differently. - Okay. - Promise? - Yeah. Promise. - It's a lot harder than I thought it would be. - You can tell me anything you want, it's okay. - I think I'm pregnant with a raccoon baby. - Oh, fuck you. - I don't know how it happened. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - I thought you were gonna say something monumental. - Well, maybe this isn't for you, but for me it's a pretty big deal. Any advice? - Do you crave grubs? For like a late night snack? You stay up all night? - Yes. - Do you wash your food compulsively, but only after you take it outta the garbage can? - My God, yes. What, what does it mean? - Oh. You're going to the hell tree to live out the rest of your days. - Oh, I feel ashamed. - It does explain your love of Beef Town. - Oh my God, Beef town! - Yeah, see? Okay. - Let's go to Beef Town. - Yeah. You see, you're proving my point. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're hilarious, I'm, I'm grown now. Take me to Beef Town now. - What? Or scott the raccoon's gonna finger bang me? Okay, I forgot that look. And now I remember it, and now I will take you to Beef Town. - Okay, let's go. - I feel like we overordered. - We? This shit's mine, I don't remember you ordering anything. - Yeah, all right. Jesus, don't forget to breath. Wow! - Who needs breathing when you have meat, cheese and bread made by an awkward teenager? Mm. - God! - I could have chocked to death! - I was right there, I what's gone for like literally three seconds. - Oh, okay then. - You know, I actually have all the funeral decor still, it'd actually be pretty convenient. - Mm, I think my family would be pretty upset if you just went through with it. - Well, I don't know, your parents love me. - No, I'm talking about my family, family. You know, my husband and kids. - Oh, right. We're in the present. I forgot. Wait, before you dislocate your jaw and swallow that hole, come with me. Okay. Here we go. Yeah. Let's see. Okay! Well, I got some pretty sweet CDs here. All the greatest hits. I got "Nirvana", "Stone Temple Pilots", "Jann Arden", "Soundgarden", "Dave Matthews Band". - Oh, "Dave Matthews Band"! - Or, I mean, if you can't, you can't choose. - No, "Dave Matthews Band". I've made my choice, damn it. - Okay. Yeah, great. If you say so. "Bryan Adams" it is. - Aah, you've always been against my Dave. - Uh, I'm just not entirely sure that's actually, technically, music. Let's see here. Okay. Let's see. How does this go? It's not... Not turning on. It's not. Is this is thing? Yeah. Okay. Um. It's not. I am sorry. I don't. Damn it! - Definitely doesn't work now. - I'm sorry. - I think you owe that apology to Mr. Adams. - Right. Sorry, Mr. Adams. Oh. Oh God. - Exactly the same. Wait, is, is that? No way. Let me see if I remember how to. - Hey, can you? - Yeah. Yeah. - 1, 2, 3. - Holy shit! I can't believe it still exists. Does it still work? - Yeah, try it. Which color am I. - Well, we'll find out. - Oh, it moved, it moved. - So I'm blue. Ah! - Oh, right off the track. - Let's do it again. - Yeah, okay. Here, you be blue this time. - Okay. - Ready? - Yeah. - See, this part's dead. Yeah, you can actually play by yourself. - It's just like this- - Oh yeah, it's not the driver at all. - No. - Now I did. Just tell me about your family. - We're good. Really good. - Yeah, me too. - Yeah, my husband, he does shift work so I can travel for my job. And my kids, well, you know how they are. They heal you, feel you. Annoy the fuck outta you. - This is so like weird and normal at the same time. - I know. We're talking about our kids. - It's like I'm talking to the future you. Is there a DeLorean parked out back? - Oh God, you're so old with that reference. - Yeah, I know. I feel, I feel old. Do you feel it? Do you? - Yeah, I feel like I ate too much. - Yeah. Yeah, now you're regretting it. - Hm, I regret nothing. - Yeah. - Oh! Holy cow! You wanna point that the other way? Jesus! - Oof, oh God, that hurt. - Jesus Christ! Do you need me to set up a saline drip for you? - Yeah, God, would you mind? - Okay, well, yeah, hop on the bed, I'll get you hooked up. - God. - Oh my God. - Know what, I think, I think Beef Town changed the recipe, I just... Bathroom? - Same, uh, same place. - Okay. Ugh. I was so cute back then. That nose ring. - Yeah, you were a badass. - Aah. Hey, look at your sister. Grade nine. Always smiling. - Yeah. - Must have killed your parents what happened to her. - Yeah, it did. Yeah, it does. - They were wonderful people. Cool parents. - Yeah, they were. They still are, they're just different. - Whenever we got horrendously drunk or had parties, they always got it. - Yeah. - We don't have to talk about them if you don't want to. - No, I do, it's just they, uh, they have changed. They loved her so much. All the love in the world didn't do shit. - They love you that much too. - I don't know. I think I'm just the one who's left. How do you watch your kid die her whole life and not be fucked up? I don't wanna be an only child. Fuck, my nose is runny. - I don't care. - Oh, you should. Oh. - You look normal to me. - Oh, I always look like this? - Yeah. - Yeah? What, with the snot coming outta my face? - Yep. - My eyes all red. - That's 'cause you haven't aged well. - Shit. Um. - What? - I got, uh, I got something to show you. It's in the attic. - There dead bodies up there? - Of course. Do you wish to join them? - No, I'm good. - Okay. Huh. Oh. Okay. Oh. Uh... Could you gimme a hand? - Oh! - Yeah, just take this away. Yeah. Okay, come here, okay. - Yeah. - Okay, I got it. There we go. So I was looking through my old stuff, to find pictures for the funeral, and I found my old trunk. - Didn't even know you had one. - I do. This, this is it. This is where I kept all my cool, old stuff. Cap guns. Comic books. Journal. Oh my God, there's some serious teen angst in this. - Is this supposed to impress me? - Okay, wait, just give me, hold on a second. And... This. - No reaction. - You don't recognize this? - Should I? - This is our masterpieces. - What! Oh shit! We were demented. - Yeah. - Oh my God. What the fuck? - Yeah. - Oh. - Oh, I made fun of your girlfriend a lot in these. - Mm. - I really didn't like her. - You hated her. You always called her Goody Two-shoes. I mean, she, she was. Except when she wasn't. - Gross. - You jealous much? - Yeah, something like that. - Yeah. I love, where is it? Lemme find. Here! This one! Oh God! I drew you asking Tito, the Yugoslavian dictator, for his autograph, and he is like, "Mm, I think you have a wrong Tito." That's pretty genius, you have to admit. - Oh, yeah, eh, no, the genius part is, here you have Michael grabbing his crotch asking, "Where are the kids?" It's real classy. - Yeah. It was the '90s. I guess I was trying to be topical. It's a little. God, we had fun, hey? - Yeah. Hey, how did we even become friends? - I don't know. You, uh, you were just there, one day. Like, um, like herpes. Herpes from Fraudrich. - Godrich. - Godrich. Right. I mean, I don't know, we just were. - Yeah, you're lucky I didn't get along with anyone else at that school. - You had high standards. - How do you explain you then? - You recognize sophistication. - Yeah, or just another person with a perverse sense of humor and a distaste for authority. - I thought that that's what sophistication meant. - Oh yeah. Yeah, close enough. - Fuck, I hated high school. - Yeah, me too. - You ever wonder what it would've been like if we'd kept in touch? - Honestly? - No. Why, please? Yes, honestly. - No. - No? - Eh, never really thought about it. - You never thought about... Never? - No. - Oh. Shit. - Well, things just kept moving, you know, it never really occurred to me. - Yeah, okay. - You know, it just, just became what it was. - Yeah. - I mean, it's not like I never thought of you, it's just I never pictured anything after we stopped being us. - Okay. - Did you? - No. - Okay. - Things just kept moving. And it never really occurred to me what would've happened if I never found myself. - Yeah, you prick, I was just being honest. - Yeah. You know what? Me too, honestly. No, totally. Honestly, I never, I never thought about how much fun we woulda had or, or how we could have supported each other, or celebrated each other's successes. Yeah, that didn't even, didn't even occur to me. - Yeah, me neither. - You still love weed? - Love is a strong word, I prefer connoisseur. - You still a connoisseur of weed? - I am. - Wait here. Let's see here, um. Yes. Oh. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. So, there's weed like everywhere here, this house is like a drug Advent calendar. - Ha. - Hah. - Oh my God. - This yard, it smells the same. - Remember that time you climbed up on the garage roof and did the running man? - Yeah, and, and my foot went through the roof and we had to fix it. - We? - Okay. You. Hey, the running man, on the roof, I was an innovator. - Well, that's fair. - Hey. Her hands are still there. - Yeah. Okay. Fuck! Oh fuck, my beautiful, perfect lungs. - So weak. - Yeah. Remember a couple years ago, before, uh, before Sadie moved back here? A bunch of her friends had come over and like made a huge fuckload of pot brownies, to help her when she needed to settle. So they made all these brownies and they, they put them all in the freezer. So my dad was there and he was, he was helping her like run errands, and clean up the house, and take her to the appointments that kinda stuff. This one afternoon, Sadie goes for a nap. And Dad, uh, he's hungry, so he is puttering around and he's rifling, just riffling through the fridge. And he goes in the freezer and he sees these brownies. So, he, uh, he takes 'em out, he puts a few of them on a plate, puts them in the microwave. Eats them all! Like, fucking, like, fucking four or five of these brownies, like chock-full of THC. So an hour or two later, Sadie comes downstairs, my dad is fucking stoned out of his, like, out of his mind. And he's just staring at a spoon. Like, he's like staring at his reflection in a spoon. And Sadie's like, "Oh", Sadie thinks he's had a stroke. And until she sees this plate of like brownie crumbs, and she's like, "Oh! Dad, are you okay?" Okay, but at this point, she, she'd lost all her teeth, so she had these, she had these dentures. And, so when she would lean in to say, "Dad, are you okay?", her dentures fell out, and they were facing up, like looking at my dad with this weird grin. My dad is, so my dad is looking at the spoon, and he is like, slowly looks down to the plate, and he looks back up for her and he goes, he goes, "I think that plate ate all your brownies." Oh, she loved that story. You know, now every time my dad has like a normal brownie, he looks a little disappointed. Oh God. - Shit. Huh. Remember when you used to come by and you'd teach Sadie how to bead, like how to bead jewelry? - I do. - Well, that was really nice. - She needed it. - It was really nice to think that you guys had that. - Yeah. I mean, not everything revolved around you. - Ouch. - It's true. You have to remember, she had a full 360 degree life. - I know. - She had to expand on her own, outside of being just the sick girl. - Well, she wasn't on her own. - I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, it's just we talked about things you couldn't have understood. You know? - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Are you just gonna sit there? - Here? - Yeah. There. - Yeah, well, I'm, uh, just sitting here. So, yeah, I'm probably just gonna keep sitting here. - I should probably go. It's great seeing you. - You got something to say, could, just say it. - It's not the right time. - You're wrong. - Of course I am. - It is the right time! Okay, just... Why did we stop? - You fucked it up! - I fucked it up, me? - When I came here at 16, I left everything. My dad gets a new job here, he uproots my whole life, I had no one. And then I met you. I never laughed like that with anyone before. Never felt that in sync. - Me neither. - Your friendship was like home to me. And then, you were gone. Cut loose, again. You asked me what happened, why we grew apart. We didn't grow apart. You left. - I left? What did I leave? - How could he even say that? - Because the way you're talking about this, it makes it sound like I just walked away from some committed, long-term engagement! We were friends! Yeah, but we were great friends. And we drifted apart. - You knew me, and you disappeared anyway. You forgot me. - I never forgot you! I thought about you all the time! - Really? - Yes! - You forgot my 19th birthday, you dumb piece of shit! - Are you kidding me? Your birthday! This is about your birthday? - It's not about my fucking birthday! - Mom, are you okay? - I don't know. I just... I needed to be near one of my kids. I'm sorry. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I'm fine. I'm just, um, I'm not fine. I'm all over the place. I just needed to be here. Analise. Oh, look at this face. I've missed you. - Missed you too. I'm so sorry. - Yeah, me too. - Is, uh, is Dad okay? - He's out in the car, he'll be a minute. And no, not even a little bit. - Oh, it's cold out there. Well, that was a shit day. - Hey, Dad. - Analise, you stayed. Thank you. Thank you so much for being here. - Of course. I'm glad to be here. Um, listen, if you guys need some family time, I can get outta here. - Are you kidding? We need some new energy around here. When you're back, I feel like it's 20 years ago. - Yeah, we were just saying that. - Yeah, like, like a time machine, and we could use one of those. Anyway. - The service was lovely. - Was it? I don't remember much. - Blur. - It was. - All I remember is I almost punch four people in the face, and they were trying to be nice, but Jesus, the stupid things that people say. - Well, what do you say? - Yeah. - Nothing. - I need a drink. Anyone else? - I'm good. - No, thank you. - More for me. - Mom, can I get you something? Mom? - Mm-hmm? - Can I get you something. - Double scotch. I'm kidding. Water would be nice. So, Analise, how've you been? - Things are good. Thanks for asking. - You two must have had a lot to catch up on? What was that look? - What look? There's no, there's no look. - You guys just had a look. I would like to know what it meant. - We, I, we were just, um- - When you walked in, we were actually in the middle of an argument. - Uh-huh. - But I think you already knew that. - Pfft, none of my business. You're both adults. Ugh. This is water. - Look what I found. You remember? Huh? - A turkey baster? - No, the famous turkey baster. You remember the story. Didn't you tell her? - No. - Would you like to hear the famous turkey baster story? - I don't know if that's necessary. - Please don't tell that story again. - I would love to hear it. - Well, hm. Okay. It was a day like any other day, except it was different, it was Sadie's birthday party. And the kids, they were all sad, because they wanted to go jump into the sandbox and play, and, well, they couldn't, 'cause they didn't have anything to play with. So, Katherine, over there, she brought out some pots and pans and a bunch of kitchen shit, and, um, saved the day. And, of course, Sadie brought out the famous turkey baster. - I inherited that Turkey baster. - Of course, see, but that that's another story, dear. So they all run out the door and they jump into the sandbox, and they start diggin' up shit- - There wasn't any dog shit in the sandbox. - No, there, it was, there was cat shit. - There was not. - Anyway, and they're, you know, they were throwing sand at each other and shoving sand down each other's pants, and we have a wonderful time. And then, um, smarty pants, over here. He's has the very bright idea to connect the hose up with the. - The turkey baster. - Of course. Okay. The little plastic ball that's connected to the- - It wasn't plastic, it was rubber. - No, it was plastic. - No, it was rubber. - No, but- - They don't make them like that anymore. - I'm so sorry. Jesus, you know, an expert in balls, obviously. Okay, so the plastic ball that was connected to the end of the turkey baster, it starts to fill up a little, and starts to get a little bigger, you know, and a little bigger, and then, uh, it goes back down again. We fill it up a little more, and it's getting bigger, it's getting bigger, it's getting a lot bigger, and it's filling up so much it starts to look like a massive expansive growth on the end of your, um- - Oh, for goodness sake, just say it. Penis! Penis! It looked like a great, huge nightmare of a penis. - Boom! It explodes all over the place, and the kids are crying, and oh my God. And I look at Sadie, and she's laughing. She's laughing, she's laughing a lot, she's laughing real hard. And then we start laughing real hard, and everybody's laughing real hard. Oh, we all... Pee, pee our pants. - We did not. - Except for me, I shit my pants. - That's a comple... - End of story. - Thanks, George. That's awesome. - Yeah, it's all right. - What are these? - Oh, I found my trunk. I was, uh, showing Analise our old drawings. - I remember finding these all over the house, and thinking either there's something very seriously wrong, or else he's found the perfect person for him. - I also found this. - Oh, George. - No, I don't think. I'll, I'll look at it later. - George. - I don't know if I can make it. - No, not as we are. - I wonder if she liked the service. - I doubt it. - We did everything we could. - Did we? - I hate this day. - I hate this life. - I hate this life, today. - Speak for yourself. - No, come on. - I got nothin' left. What can I give you, any of you? - Nothing. - I gave her life, and now it's gone. And so am I. - Now, come on, they don't need to hear any of this. - Do you know how many people said to me today, "Oh well, at least she's not in pain anymore." Hell, I even started saying it. But I want her in pain, goddamn it! Because then, at least, I would know she was here. At least I'd be able to look at her and hold her. And tell her I love her. - We have to stick together through this. - Do we? - Yes. - I'm not sure if I can. I'm not sure if I can spend what's left of my life looking at you every day. We failed! We didn't save her! We, we didn't find anyone who could save her. - You're right, we couldn't, and she died! Sadie died, Katherine, but we're still here and I love you. I have loved you for 45 years, and I've rolled with everything that life has thrown at us, because we did it together. We fought everything together, my shit, your shit. You, you think of all the other people we know, They couldn't make it, because they weren't able to adapt to their life changes. But we did it, and we, no, we survived, and we'll survive this. Like, I don't know how, I don't know what it's gonna look like, but we just have to think of this as a beginning, it's a new beginning. I promise you, Katherine, we can do this. - But I hate you. - I know, and that's all right. - Is it? - I can't fight with you anymore. I'm too tired. Good night, everyone. - Another fun night at our house. - You okay? - Yeah. So, it's not about your birthday. - My whole life I hated the dark. I still do. As soon as the sun starts to go down, I, I feel hollow. A desperation start to climb into my throat. And make me feel like something terrible is going to happen. When I was a kid, my dad and I would go to this muffin shop. We would go every couple of weeks, and he would get the bran muffin and a coffee, and I would get one with the sweet cream cheese on top. I really looked forward to it. Except for the drive. The drive there, I would, I would feel that creeping hollow. It was dangerous, ominous, growing. As though I was starting to realize how alone we all are in the end. As I grew up, no matter how many people I was with, when the dark came, I felt it. It was panic. It was anxiety. It was that knowing that no one really gave a shit about me. But I never felt that when I was with you. And you broke my heart. You were the only person who could take that feeling of being alone away. So when you left, for whatever reason you left, I was so angry with you. Because it came back. And over the years, it almost broke me. You left, or disappeared, or however you wanna frame it, and the loss I felt was massive. It was real. It frightened me. I don't think it's ever really gone away. And I thought it was my fault. - You're right. I did ignore you. I was an asshole. And I am sorry. I didn't take the chance to tell you how I felt. I just let you drift away and disappear. I was a coward, and it was cruel. I am ashamed of it. - I did love you. I do still. That's why I'm here. But, man, that disappearing act was bullshit. You tricked me, and I was alone again. God, and I wish we spent those last 20 years together. But we didn't. We aren't those kids anymore. They were idiots pretending to be adults. We're here. Together. Now. We'll be of far more used to each other now than any other time in our lives. - Fuck, you're smart. - Fuck, I know. - I don't know how I woulda gotten through this day without you. I dunno how to thank you. - A lifetime supply of Beef Town would suffice. - Yeah. You. - Get the fuck in there, you. Oh shit. Come on, come on, come on, come on. - Hey. - Sorry. I love you. - I love you too. I'm done. - I think you pissed yourself. - Yeah, I shit myself. - Yeah, I think you did that too. - Hm. - Hey. Dad? Dad! Wake up. Dad. - Okay. - Dad. - Okay, I'm up. I'm up. Oh. Hey, kiddo. - Hi. What is that? - It's a joke. - I don't get it. - Brought brekky. - Ooh. - Muffin and coffee. - Oh yeah, that's just what I needed. - Um, can I have your muffin? - You just had a muffin. - It's okay. - Thanks. - Mm, looks good. - It's so good. - Mm-hmm? - Should get one for yourself. - Yeah. Let me look into that. Let's get the fuck outta here. - How many muffins do you think you can actually eat? - Uh, four to six. - Four to six? Okay, I'll get a dozen next time. - Okay. - You can eat half. Maybe you can give one to me. - Yeah. ♪ I was sleeping when you left this morning ♪ ♪ I was dreaming when you disappeared ♪ ♪ And a note was on the stairs ♪ ♪ And the front door was wide open ♪ ♪ And the note written in your own hand ♪ ♪ And morning light was golden ♪ ♪ And I began to understand ♪ ♪ I was sleeping the whole time I knew you ♪ ♪ And I woke up when you went away ♪ ♪ And the sky in the suburbs are the perfect blue ♪ ♪ And the front door was wide open ♪ ♪ And the note was saying goodbye ♪ ♪ And the dream that we all had was stolen ♪ ♪ And I began to understand ♪ ♪ I only see you when I'm dreaming ♪ ♪ I can only find you when I sleep ♪ ♪ And the house we all lived in is frozen in time ♪ ♪ And the front door stays wide open ♪ ♪ Should you ever come back to me ♪ ♪ And the memories that we're all holding ♪ ♪ Won't set us free ♪ ♪ Just wait and see ♪ ♪ I was sleeping until you woke me ♪ ♪ And the day since have brought me to tears ♪ ♪ And it wasn't the distance that broke me ♪ ♪ It was the fear ♪
