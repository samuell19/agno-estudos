RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Graphics package ready. Roll main title. Camera three, tilt down and refrain. Ready, camera one. Kelly, I've got Professor Stevens queued up on the third monitor. Excellent. River, you're on in five, four, go for theme song. Go, River. Good morning, Milwaukee. I'm River Tamland, wishing you a very Merry Christmas Eve. Here's what's happening in your neck of the woods. Hey! Let me guess. A Redeye, and one chocolate croissant? Actually, no. What? Your order is my one constant in an unstable world. I'm just grabbing some goodies for my crew. Can I get a cranberry sage pie, and a dozen of the reindeer cookies? Christmas Eve plans? I do this Christmas Eve party with my friends every year. That's so nice. Hey. We just made these fresh. Orange cranberry white chocolate chip. Do you want to try? Thank you, but I'm on a mission. How about you? I mean, how could I say no? What can I get for you? It's my first time here. Surprise me. Hey Case, I'll be in the office in five. Thanks. That's to... There's no such thing as a bad free cookie, but that is a really good cookie. Thank you. Hi, I'm alone, I'm from Imperium National Bank. We are sponsoring the New Year's Plunge on New Year's Day, and the crowd of human popsicles is gonna be in desperate need of warm drinks. We would take care of the booth, the signage, there's guaranteed to be a crowd. It's like free marketing. I mean, who doesn't want that, right? Said the guy in marketing. Got me. Yeah, let me see if I can get the staff, but that sounds like a great opportunity. Yeah? Great, good. You won't regret it. Cinnamon latte? That sounds really good. Take care. Thanks so much. Okay, let's hear some of those big segment ideas. How about a 25 foot tall snowman? Do we have any footage of the snowman? It violates several zoning laws, and they're still trying to get ahold of more snow. That's gonna be a pass. What about favorite ways to tailgate from this past football season? We can't definitely state what toppings make a real Wisconsin brat, the fans will riot. That's true, I can see the emails pouring in now. I could always do reporter on the street and ask them what their New Year's resolution is. Feels very similar to what we did last year. But what if we did a reoccurring segment. Pick someone, and then follow them with their resolution through the month of January. I like that. It's got depth, visual appeal. Great. Casey, why don't you start interviewing candidates? Put the word out on the street, online, you know, I want people who are willing to jump in. Real go-getters. You got it. Good one. This year, we posted record highs in customer satisfaction. By increasing our event budget, we can do even better. I can do this. I'm telling you, this is very achievable, with a slightly larger budget. I'm intrigued. But, I'm nervous your team might already be spread too thin. The bank is already sponsoring the New Year's Plunge, the Blizzard Obstacle Course, the chili cook offs. It's a lot of events. For good reason. Let's talk about the magic of Santa. Now, responses to our surveys show that sponsoring Santa at the holiday market boosted good will towards the bank substantially. In fact, every single time we partner with a local business or event, surveys show that trust in our bank increases, and so, with our most ambitious sales goals ever this year... If they're going to invest in us, we're gonna have to invest in them too. It's good for them, it's good for us. It's good for everyone. All right. I look forward to seeing what you can do with an even bigger budget next year. I can't believe you pulled that off. We pulled this off. Can I take you out to celebrate? Another time? I need to finish those vendor emails so I can head over to my mom's place. Momma Jones. Tell her her favorite son says hello. And you two love that joke. Hey, get outta here, I'll do them. Trust me, I'm much more scared of Momma Jones than vendor agreements. You're the best. And you tell the whole family I said Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Hey, sis. Sheila, Sheila, slow down, slow down. Okay. Right, okay, I'm gonna get some. I'm gonna pick it up, yeah, I'm gonna get it on my way out of here, it's literally gonna take me two minutes. Okay? Yes, I will. Okay. I'll see you then, buh-bye. Let's see... You really will do anything for the best story, huh? The pre-tape still needs work, but I didn't want to keep the crew from their families. And you? Your mom's not gonna fill your stocking with coal if you're late? She knows how crazy things can get. I normally drive out Christmas morning. Just tell me you're not spending Christmas Eve here, alone. No, no. I do a Secret Santa things with my friends. I'm headed there after this. Look. I know the beginning of this year was tough, okay? Ratings were down, and the executives came down hard on us. We rose to the occasion. Look at us now. Number one in Milwaukee. Now, I may be the face of this operation, but you did that. I know it. You single handedly transformed this show into something will real integrity. And I know you sacrificed a lot to do it. Thank you, I appreciate that. Good. I'm hoping if I butter you up enough you'll get me that local Emmy. Those gingerbread house stories, more juicy, hard hitting news, right? Now that ratings are up, we're on the same page. Now get out of here and have some fun, will you? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hello? Is anyone home? Merry Christmas! Uncle Tommy, Uncle Tommy, Uncle Tommy! Merry Christmas! You girls excited for Santa? Yeah? Yeah, you know Santa only comes once you're fast asleep though, right? Okay, but come see what we put on our wishlist for Santa. Girls, Uncle Tommy has probably had a very long day, and that's a really long list. Nope, I can do it. Okay. Okay, here we go. Okay. Hey. Hi, Kelly. Are you still coming? Sorry, I just have to finish editing this and set the rundown for the 26th, and then... Yeah, yeah. We get it. Do you have an ETA? I'll be there as soon as I can. Okay. Thanks. Me too. You're right. She's not coming. Want a cookie? I won't tell Santa. Yes, two please. It's been a long day. Or a long yeah by the look of it. I'm not confident you sleep anymore. I'll sleep next year. You should make that your New Year's resolution. I don't do resolutions. Besides, that's kind of a lame one, don't you think? I have two kids. Nothing about the promise of sleep sounds lame to me. I really appreciate you showing up here tonight. You're a really great uncle. I'm an even better brother. You are a life saver. Okay, so why don't we start with those. Yep. And then we'll be done soon. Merry Christmas! Come on in. I can't believe I missed Lisa and Jackson again. How upset were they? Well, you know, the word straw, and camel, and back were thrown around quite a bit, but not the word break, more just like, "That's a lot of straws on that camel's back." I know I've missed a lot lately but, missing our Christmas Eve, it just feels... Yeah. It kinda stung. Yeah. Look, we know you love us in your own fierce, stubborn, Kelly way. And we all learned pretty early on that Kelly's gonna do what Kelly's gonna do. And if you say no, there is not an earthquake powerful enough to move you. Am I really that stubborn? No. Look. The power of your "no" has kept our group from making some pretty catastrophic decisions over the years. I mean, you single handedly saved Lisa from that asymmetrical bob, and I think we both know what saved your show this year. We get that had to be your first priority. Yeah, but I should've been able to do all of that without making you all feel like number two, or seven, or 100. So, how do I fix this? Well, you'll have to show up more often. And slowly, one event at a time, things will get better. And hey, New Year's Eve is a week away. Fresh start. Yeah. You are coming to New Year's, right? I don't know. It's late, loud music, and I wouldn't miss it for the world. Good. 'Cause it might help to apologize to them in person. Like, really bring your A game. Of course. Just, I'm gonna tell them... You're the most important people in the world to me. And I know those are just words right now, but it's the new year, and I promise that I am going to strive to be a much better friend. Good. Because we have been taking applications to replace you. Some strong contenders. And one of them has a lake house. Thank you, for apologizing. It means a lot. And you're right, it's a new year, we all get a fresh start. You can't be serious. I don't know what else to say, I don't believe in resolutions. I find them restrictive. It doesn't hurt to have just a little direction. You say direction, I say blinders. I like to be open to possibilities. I do! I'd rather be flexible and say yes to whatever life throws at me. That sounds a little passive. Yeah. It's like you're letting life make all the choices instead of you. Okay, well, also, you know that most resolutions statistically end in failures. I'm not trying to start my new year already feeling like I'm behind. No, no, no. See, our work schedule's gonna take care of that. So, it's the New Year's resolution, what are you guys thinking? I'm going to cut back to one cup of coffee a day. I'm sorry, how is less coffee gonna make the year better? I'm gonna finally finish my novel. That mystery series you were working on? It's actually a young adult thriller now. I switched it up a few months ago. Oh, great. What about you? I'm gonna do my new spin class three days a week. What about you? You know, I was thinking I was gonna go with my usual of... - 52 books in 52 weeks? - 52 books in 52 weeks? Yeah. But... I realized, I said no to a lot last year, and while that's nothing new for me, every time I said no, it felt like I was saying no to these small moments. But I realized that the big stuff is made up of all these small moments, and I'm missing them. And I miss you guys. Well, good news, there's a pretty easy one word solution for that. You're right. I'm gonna say no to no this year. This girl loves the word no so much that she'd rather say a double negative than just say yes. I'm serious, that's gonna be my resolution. I am saying yes. Like, to going out dancing after the ball drops tonight? Yes. And maybe for karaoke after? Yes. And you'll do the New Year's Plunge with me tomorrow morning? No. Absolutely not. No one actually uses their resolution for serious soul searching, you know? They usually fall into one of a couple predictable categories. Okay, fine. What's my resolution? Probably to get more than seven hours a sleep a night. That's... Okay, yeah, no, you're right, but you've known me since college. It doesn't matter, I'm in marketing. It's literally my job to be able to predict what people are going to do. You're good, but you're not that good. So, prove it. Try the table behind you. Okay. It's gonna go down like this, huh? I wish you guys were there, it was a disaster. The teleprompter broke, I was sweating, it was, it was a nightmare. I am so sorry to interrupt. My name is Tom, Happy New Year. My friend and I over here, we're having a difference of opinion over New Year's resolutions. Could I try and guess what your resolutions are? I love this game. They love this game. Okay. Raise your hand if your resolutions have anything to do with giving something up, preferably food related. I'm cutting back to one cup of coffee a day, or is accepted. That's specific, and actionable. Still counts. For the record, no one's year is any better with less coffee in it. True. Raise your hand if your resolution is about going to the gym. Raise your hand if your resolution is about finishing a creative project. Novel. He's good. No. No, no, no, sorry, no, don't encourage him, okay? I'm sorry for him. I'm so encouraged right now. Excellent. So, that leaves you. You're never gonna guess it. Really? Okay. Meditating every day. I don't have time to meditate. Getting organized. I bet dessert I'm the most organized person in this restaurant. Finally kicking your Candy Crush habit. I've never crushed a candy. Taking up kickboxing? The only thing I kick is bad habits. I cave, what is it? I'm going to say yes to every social invitation I receive. Now that is interesting. Okay, I may have picked the most interesting person in the restaurant. Zero offense, I'm sorry. I meant to say, I think you're the one brilliant exception to my New Year's resolution rule. I'm so curious, what inspired this? I boxed myself in a little too much last year, so I'm taking a chance on yes. I love that, yeah, yes! Fall in love with yes, no is the enemy. Hey! No has been a very trusty friend of mine. Why say no to something when you could say yes to something else? You're not saying no to going out, you're saying yes to staying in. Well, it's just a positive spin on things. So, what's your resolution then? Don't believe in them. They do, in fact, exist. I like to stay open to possibilities. Possibilities covers a whole range of outcomes. Some of which could be a whole basket of yikes. How long are you doing this resolution for? Maybe I'll do it until my birthday on February 8th. A lot can happen in a month. Yeah. Hey, we're going to this awesome New Year's party. There's gonna be music, and dancing, and the countdown. You want to come with us? That sounds really fun, but I can't. You're really starting this resolution off on the wrong foot. Hey, and I still have 32 minutes to say no to anything. Plus, I already said yes to my friends tonight. Well, I can't say no to that. Okay, good luck with your resolution. Thank you. And Happy New Year. You too. Hey, Tom. How do you want to get there? I'm thinking we walk. Just, one sec. Okay, everyone, we are going to write down our resolutions. Fold your paper like this, and then we are going to... Watch our wishes go up in flames? No. We are going to set our intention, and then watch it drift up into the sky. Why are we doing this? We're letting it go, and sending it up in the hopes that we get back what we need to make it come true. We missed you. I'll see you inside? Yeah, man. Okay, let's do this! - 10, nine... - Nine. Six, five... Hey, where are my girls? They passed out at 11. Happy New Year though. Happy New Year. Happy New Year! - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers, cheers, cheers. Kelly Ezekiel Leone. Not my middle name. I would like to officially invite you to do the New Year's Plunge with me tomorrow. You've gotta be kidding me. I'm not. Yeah, good one. Happy New Year, plungers! Welcome to the Milwaukee Polar Plunge, presented by Imperium National Bank. Make sure you register if you want to plunge. I can be convinced to have the camera focused on not you, if maybe a certain story about the biggest snowman in the world can get an approval. Nice try. Worth a shot. Well, have fun with your plunge. I've got the marketing guy from the bank sponsorship ready for an interview. Really? Actually, since I'm here, do you mind if I go prep him real quick? You're the boss. Hey. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. New Year's Plunge? That's your first yes to the New Year? However did you guess? Because no sane person would decide to dive into a freezing cold lake. Says the guy who's sponsoring the event. Okay. You did a little research on me, huh? Actually, that is official Wake Up Milwaukee business. I'm the producer. You just came over here to talk logistics. Just a little interview prep. Okay, all right. So I'm not gonna find any other fun little surprises in my coat pockets? Up until last night, I had given my phone number out to approximately no one. So I guess the words I'm searching for are... Your move. See, I've been thinking about it. I can't ask you out. But see, you can. This is a rejection free zone, of fear free dating. That's the thing though, I don't want you to say yes because of some resolution, I want a real yes. So I'm not gonna ask you out until no is back on the table. So, you Mr. Open-To-The-Possibilities- Live-In-The-Moment is gonna let an entire month go by? There's a pretty simple alternative. Which is? You could always ask me out. See, that's, it's different. I mean, it's the 21st century... It makes it way dicey. I didn't really take you as... We ready? The plunge is gonna start soon. Actually, if you could just give us one more second, we're trying to sort... Actually, yup, great. You guys have a great interview, and I'm gonna go jump in a subzero lake for fun. Happy New Year, this has been real, okay. I know it seems crazy, but I think it's gonna be great. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. Shakespeare? It is cold. On your marks... I thought we were committing to bathing suits. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This was your idea! Get set, go! Mistakes. Here, have some hot chocolate. Thank you. I am so proud of you. Miss! Miss, miss. Tell us, how does it feel to know that your year can only get better from here? How'd the interview go? Great. Yeah, he was awesome. Where did Tom go? He had to run, but he told me to tell you that you have his number just in case you need a followup. Okay. Thanks, Casey. Anytime. Let's go get warm. Replay it one more time. This is... What were you thinking? New Year's resolution. Again, what in the world were you thinking? My resolution is to say yes to every invitation I receive for a month. Why? That sounds awful. Well, I'm turning 30 next month, and I realized I shut off aspects of my personal life. So, I am staying open. I'm spending time with friends, getting outside my comfort zone. It's a great story. A great story. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. I'm a behind the camera kind of person. We could send her to games, concerts, that Blizzard 5K. The art exhibit, the circus. Wait, isn't she afraid of clowns? Perfect. No, no. Clowns are fine. Magicians on the other hand... I mean, don't you have better candidates than me? Listen, it would be great for ratings, showing vulnerability from one of our own, right? Come on. Anything for the best story. Anything for the show. Yes! I have the perfect first segment. Maybe you can set the camera up over there? Thanks. Why can't somebody invite me to lay in front of a fire on a big rug and read? Okay, I've got everything except for your phone, and we'll meet you at the finish line. How you feelin'? I'm feeling like I'm only gonna shoot River's bad side for a week. It's not all that bad. I saw the Imperium National Bank signs floating around. Maybe your cute bank guy, Tom, will be here. Was that his name? - It was Tom... - AJ. Was that his name? Tom? Just ask him out already. Take a chance. It's not a chance. I know it will happen. Well, cute banter for the first couple of weeks, we'll fall for each other, I'll flake on him one too many times for work, and then he'll break up with me over dinner at a candlelit restaurant. Cool. Kel. Or, I'll break up with him with some big, noble speech about bad timing, and either way, it won't work out, and I'll end up scraping the cream off of Oreos by myself. Hey. Hey! Either I'm interrupting something very serious, or that was perhaps the most depressing romantic comedy pitch ever. Actually, we were just discussing self fulfilling prophecies. Isn't that right? Yeah, that's right. Well, anyways, I'll let you guys get to the race. Good luck, see you at the finish line. See ya. So, you're actually running this thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Our bank thought it would be good to have someone from our team out here, on the course. Here I am. Yeah, what's the worst that could happen? I get a little sore tomorrow? No, the worst that can happen is that camera captures the face plant of a lifetime, and you become an overnight internet cautionary tale. You're a bit of a pessimist. I'm a realist. And if I had known, I could've prepared, and changed around my whole workout routine. So, the winner of this race gets a $50 gift certificate to Hoagie Heaven, I don't think it's that serious. Hey, it's no fun if it's not serious. Runners 27 and 34 to the start line, please. Plus, if I'm gonna do something, I'm gonna do it well. How about this... How about we just race, the two of us. And then, after I win, you buy us coffee. After you win, I bet you coffee? That's right. I think that sounds a bit like a coffee date. Did you ask me on a coffee date? Nope, just a bet, that may happen to segue into some friendly conversation. Runners on your mark... Okay. Game on. Get set... All right. And go! Hey! No fair. You need a hand? Nope. That was an invitation, you can't say no. It's a trap. I'm gonna want a medium latte, extra whip. My coffee order. That's your order? So judgmental, what's yours? Redeye. Of course it is. Takes the lead! Race isn't over yet! I don't know. You're pretty good at this. Okay, so, even though I wasn't prepared for this, it was actually really fun. This is Kelly Leone with Wake Up Milwaukee. Thanks. For sure, thank you. You crushed it. We are so proud of you! Let's go celebrate, yeah? Get you all the carbs. Yeah, thanks, I... Yeah, no, that's great. Thank you, my friend. Come on. What's this? Some guy dropped those off for you. He left a note. Hello! Lisa, what are you doing here? I'm just on my way to work, and thought I'd enjoy my one cup of coffee a day with you. You can never have too much coffee. Plus, I have a little invite to extend your way. Which is? I would like to formally invite you, Miss Kelly Emmanuele Leone... Not my middle name. To a speed dating event with me. And I can't say no. Come on! Consider it a favor to me. You'll be there for moral support, and afterward I'll buy you dinner? Today is shaping up to be a huge exercise in humility. What do you mean? Welcome back, Milwaukee. As many of you know, our very our producer, Kelly Leone, has made a resolution to say yes to every invitation that she receives. Kelly, talk to us about why you made this resolution? Well, I thought it would be good to step outside of my comfort zone, River. And boy, will she today. Kelly, what is your greatest fear? That'd be magicians, River. Well, we are very excited that Kelly has agreed to assist Milwaukee's own Eric the Magnificent. Go on, Kelly. Hey, man. I got your text about tonight. I will definitely be there. I knew you wouldn't leave me hanging, but that's not why I called. Hey, what's up? I was going over our numbers for the chili cook-off, and I really think we need to tell Glenn to increase our... No, no, no, no. We can fix this without going to Glenn. Yeah, but we're understaffed, and we're over budget. There will be a more creative solution. We're small in numbers, but we're big on enthusiasm. Yeah, well not everyone, sorry, anyone matches your enthusiasm. And we're gonna need more than just that with this much on the line. I don't know about that. People can really surprise you if given the chance. Ladies and gentlemen, Kelly is now levitating. All right, all right. Take another look when you come in. Yeah man, bye. Kelly Leone, everyone. Starting the new year off with a touch of magic. Okay, that wasn't my thing, but it was awesome to see you do your thing. Thoroughly entertaining. Almost as entertaining as watching someone, say, levitate on a table? Oh, no, you saw that. I recorded it. I will be printing a banner for your birthday party next month. I'm not having a party. But see, I just invited you to it, so... I see. I see what you did there. Fine. But please, no magicians. This resolution is quickly turning into Live with Kelly and her worst fears. I don't think that's such a bad thing. And you have been playing it pretty safe these last few years because maybe you are just the tiniest bit afraid of failure? Well, who isn't? Being bad at something feels exactly how it sounds. Okay. Real talk? I have seen you turn down some pretty exciting opportunities because you weren't so sure you could pull it off. Just that wisdom, having a firm enough grip on your comfort zone to not plummet into failure. Yeah, it's just, maybe all that holding on so tight might make you more sore than a quick brush with the ground ever would. You've gotta be kidding me. What are you doing? Avoiding Tom. I can see that. Why? Because I'm here to support you. What kind of friend would I be if I... Great! You hop on over there, ask Tom out real quick, and then you can focus all your energy on helping me get a date. How does one even speed date? It is just like producing, okay? You're gonna hear a couple pitches, and all you gotta do is trust your gut and say yes or no. You'll be amazing, have fun. Bye. It was great talking to you. Hi. Patrick. So, you work for Imperium National Bank? Yep, with Tom. He's a great guy, that Tom. Did you grow up in Wisconsin? No, I moved here for college. That's where I met Tom. Did you know that Tom is actually the president of our student... So, is this how this is gonna go? For the next two minutes and 30 seconds? Yeah. So, back to Tom. So, you've known Kelly since childhood? Yeah, listen. I need you to know that if I was vetting you for myself, these next few minutes would be far less painful. What's your biggest fear? Abandonment, and gas station sushi. Dinner with one person, living or dead? My Nana, or Aaron Rodgers. Go Pack. Sir. Please describe to me the ending of your last serious relationship. Define serious. Not a good answer, Tommy. Hey! Only my sister Sheila gets to call me Tommy. Well, lovely. Hi there, Kelly. Hey. Fancy meeting you here. I'm gonna be honest with you, my pride is a little bit bruised. Here you are at a speed dating event when I so very delicately placed the ball in your court. In fairness, you're also here, at a speed dating event. I'm here for moral support only. So am I. By the way, Patrick, clearly a master of the pitch. Oh, good, so he was convincing? Yes. Yes. Okay. Spoiler alert, this is a sure thing, there is no world in which I say no. Do you want to grab dinner sometime? That's my cue. I should... Wait, wait, wait. Sorry, could you go around? Sorry, Peter. How about Tuesday? I'm trying out curling. Wait, really? Don't laugh. Wednesday? Nope, sponsoring an event. How about Thursday? AJ invited me to go dancing, unless you want to... No, we have like five more dates until I introduce you to my other left foot. I'd say Friday, but... I can't either, I'm going to the hockey game with my friends. Wait, really? Me too. It's for the bank. Hey, we have a VIP box. You're welcome to... No, we couldn't possibly... Yes, we could. We'd love to. Okay. It's a date. - See you Friday. - See you Friday. - Bye. - Tom. Brings it into the zone, drop pass, is he gonna take the shot? No! Goes back to the net, and he loses it behind the net. Coming back the other way. Maybe you could set up over there? Can I confess something? Sure, of course. I'm not really a hockey fan. Well, that is... Me neither. Seriously? No. Three brothers played, I just never caught the bug. Three brothers? Three brothers, and a big sister. What about you? I'm an only child. What? Definitely explains your propensity for saying no. In a house with four other siblings, you could scream no at the top of your lungs, you're still outvoted. So you had to go along to get along? Absolutely. You gotta make alliances, and then, well then you have a partner to blame when they knock over your grandma's lamp. Yeah, there was no one to point the finger at in my house. See, I feel like only child life is awesome. You have absolute control of the TV, you never have to share your toys. And no one to share the pressure either. It's life lived under a microscope. You know what the best thing about stadiums is? The intoxicating of groupthink. I was gonna go with cheese fries, but... But there's a whole table here of catered food. You want to go get cheese fries? Yeah. - Here you go. - Thanks. Thanks a bunch. No, I actually don't like cheese fries. I have so many questions. Starting with why would somebody agree to split something that they knowingly dislike? I just came for the company. I was being nice. There's nice, and then there's deferential. Why do I feel like that's the nice way of saying it? I'm just saying, you don't have to worry about sharing your opinions around me. I think fake cheese isn't real food, and I find it disgusting. Well, I think you're wrong, but, I appreciate your honesty. So, Monday, I'm going to the Chinese New Year's celebration. There'll be music, and some cool installations. The show's sending me for my resolution segment. And, you know, maybe I thought it could be a good opportunity for the bank... Are you asking me out on a business date? No. I'm asking you on a date, and really trying to sweeten the pot so you'll say yes. Yes. I'm there, I can't wait. Great. Now, Kelly. This week you were invited to try curling for the first time. What were your more surprising takeaways? This resolution has really shown me that my life can benefit from having some adventure thrown in. Let's see how she did. Hi, Kelly Leone, and I'm here at Milwaukee's own local curling club, about to be swept off my feet. Here's where my adventure took an interesting turn. But in my defense, the ice is very slippery. I wasn't much for throwing stones, but they did say I had a knack for sweeping. And we're in commercial, back in three minutes. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, what's up? So, I've interviewed at least 20 people who say that accounts were opened under their name at Imperium National Bank without their permission. Is anyone willing to go on the record? Not yet. But the more that people come forward, the more likely that they will. Keep digging. And if you can get some Intel from someone inside Imperium, all the better. You got it. Now that seems like hard hitting news. Don't you know someone at Imperium National Bank? Sorry, I misspoke. Aren't you dating someone at Imperium National Bank? If we were gonna go after Imperium, our story would have to be bulletproof. Our integrity... If I asked Tom to get involved, I mean, the fact that I'm even dating Tom is... You know what? Maybe you're right. It's early in the story, maybe it's nothing. No, 20 people isn't nothing. Maybe just cross that bridge when you come to it. Okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everyone owes Lisa $100 for a wedding gift. Love the rules, pay up. Yup, thank you. Got two sets of twins, but sure, I'll go back to night school. For a game called "Life", you're afforded very few choices. It's a pretty bleak outlook. In all fairness, I did offer you other options. At what point does a love of boardgames tip into obsession? Two, three, four, five. Move to a new city. Okay, there was like a look. A look? No, no look. Lisa, I think it's your spin. Right. Okay, no, no, what's going on? There's like a look going on here. It's just, like, a year ago you were applying for jobs in another city, and you were so excited about it. Yeah, but I was worried about losing my job. I mean, who would I be if I bailed when the going got tough? That's right. And when the going gets tough, the tough get going. Exactly. To Chicago. No. What, you spend one year as a flaky friend and all of a sudden they're trying to ship you out of the state? Don't be dramatic, it's a two hour drive. 90 minutes by train. And there's a Six Flags like right in the middle. We did our research. Look, as long as we've known you, your goal has been the same. Emmy Award winning news producer. But dreams change, okay? You started producing home movies, what, when we were in middle school? Made me wear that terrible wig, and pretend to be Diane Sawyer. You were born for this. Come on. You spent a couple weeks now living in the yes, doesn't that make the unknown feel a little more... You're right, I have done things this month that I never would have imagined I'd do. And you did it all without falling on your face. All right, all right. Truth is, a year ago, I was terrified of failure. But maybe now it's a good time to be open to possibilities. And the response we're getting for this New Year's segment is through the roof. You guys really knocked it out of the park on this one. All the credit goes to Kelly. It's a team effort, and clearly, I wouldn't have done it without you. Now let's talk about this story Casey's working on about Imperium National Bank, where do we stand? We've got 20 people who've come forward stating that the bank has opened up credit card and bank accounts under their names without their permission. We think it has to do with incentives for the sales team. Is anyone on the record? Three. But Casey is working on more. This is intriguing, but it's not there yet. This is a great story. We've got people on record stating that... Claiming that. It's difficult to prove. We need something concrete, otherwise it's just their word against the word of a national bank. But if they're telling the truth, the proof is out there. We'll need a whistleblower on the inside. Find either one of those things, we'll run it. A whistleblower. I can't ask him to do that. You must really like this guy. Why would you say that? Because a year ago, this would've been a no brainer. Hey, do you have a second? Hey, yeah. What's going on? I was just hoping we could meet up. No meat! Or we don't have to. No, no, I'm sorry, I'm not talking to you. Leo, that's the vegetarian section. I'm at the chili cook-off right now, you're welcome to come if you want. Like how I didn't make that an invitation? You sound pretty swamped. Hey, that's actually the kid's section right over there. Thanks. Please come, I'd love to see you. Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Okay, restaurants are all set up, but the registration for amateur entrance is a mess. The forms apparently didn't print properly... No problem, I'm on it, just stall. Stall, right. Just stall. Hey! I'm so glad to see you. How are you doing? This looks... Yeah, it's gonna be great. It's just... Hey guys, the extra bales of hay go out in the game tent. Thank you. What did you want to talk to me about? You know, we can... Tickets! We have nobody on tickets. What do you mean, where's Laura? I had to move her to the kid's station. Then why... I could do it. No, no, no, you don't have to. No, let's just put Laura... Do you need the help? Be honest. I would write songs of your heroism. Great, I'm on it. Tickets. - Thank you, this way. - Okay. Yeah. Show me the cornbread. All right, should be good now. Here you go. There you go, enjoy yourself. Hey there. Hey. There you go. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. What happened in there? Well, we've been running a lot of events back to back. I think I was a little long on promises, and a little short on help on this one. Turns out there may be a limit to the whole I can do it all philosophy. What did you want to talk to me about? So, my reporter dug up some pretty powerful allegations about Imperium National Bank, claiming that they were opening accounts in customer's names without their permission. We have at least 20 people claiming that. So... Do you have a response? No, I mean, if it's true, it's awful. If it's true. Well, it's not sure, right? And 20 people, serious, but I have a bunch of marketing analytics that show thousands of happy customers. If it's true, it's only 20 people that we know about. I know this company, I know the people I work with here. I just find it really hard to believe that they would do something like that. When the story breaks, you and I can't be together. It would be an ethical nightmare. It would put your job at risk, my job could be at risk. I think the most sensible thing would be for us to both go our separate ways before we both get hurt. The thing is, I'm not a very sensible guy. You've laid out a very compelling case for all the things that could go wrong, but you know what? I'm just not okay throwing out all that's good here based on something that might happen. That might happen. This whole story might fall through. It's just a matter of time before we uncover and run it. Apart? Our only option is apart? What if we stay together, we cross that bridge when we come to it? Who knows what solutions we might find along the way? Okay, if this all blows up, I'm gonna keep the receipts from this conversation, and I promise you I am going to shoulder 100% of the blame. Okay. If we're going to cross that bridge when we come to it, we're gonna have to angle down that road pretty slowly. Agreed. I'm not the one who jumps head first into things. I hear you, I'm with you. We'll go slow until we're in the clear. Okay. I'm uncalling it, but with a firm speed limit of 35 miles an hour. That sounds fair. Yeah. To be clear, would kissing you right now be like, 35 miles an hour, or would that be like 65 miles an hour? Goodnight, Tom. For Wake Up Milwaukee, I'm Kelly Leone. Great, I think we got it. You can head off, thank you so much. Hey there. It's Happy New Year in Mandarin. You ready for this? Not nearly as ready as you are, clearly, however, I'm equally as excited. Are you doing a segment? We just wrapped up. I thought it might be good to set some professional boundaries. Or you don't want to share the limelight with me. It's okay, I get it, you're a big star, I don't want to steal your thunder. Please, I cannot wait for this segment to be over. What? You're so good at it! You're sweet. Stop it! That would fall into sugar coating, which is very strictly forbidden. Yes, I am biased, and so I think you're amazing on camera. It's got me wondering what you're doing behind it. I figured out pretty early on I'm more of a behind the scenes, magically make things happen, and then swoop away unseen kind of person. The trusty Sancho to our anchor's Don Quixote. I don't see you like that, as the trusty sidekick. In the few short weeks I've known you, you've always stood out as the star. Well, you're meeting me at a weird time. Maybe, or maybe you should just admit to yourself that a teeny-tiny part of you does like being in front of the camera. In front of camera, no. In front of an audience... What? Nothing. Wait. Tell me. I used to do all these storytelling open mics in college. You know, where they give a theme, and then you have to tell a story, and it's under five minutes. Sure, I know. I'm talking to Story Slam about sponsoring an event in late February. They're the ones with the podcast. I love them. You should do it. I don't know. I'm inviting you to perform. Part of your resolution. It'll be over by then. My birthday's February 8th. Oh, right! Is it a big one? 30, actually. My friends are throwing me a birthday party that Saturday if you want to... Love to. Great. There's a market, we could grab some food and walk around? Absolutely. I swear, that was my first and only speed dating event. It just wasn't my... Speed? They're the most awkward things ever. In case you haven't noticed, small talk is not my forte. You're in good company, my conversation falls on the deep end. But now, I kind of want to hear your small talk. What's the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you? That's like Mt. Everest talk. Okay, okay. You go. Okay. What's your favorite childhood book? "Velveteen Rabbit". Never read it. What? It's a classic! Yeah, I was always a "Where the Wild Things Are" fan. What did you want to be when you grew up? Batman. No, I didn't know what I wanted to be, but I knew I wanted to live in Chicago. Really? So did I. Why didn't you do it? That story is not smalltalk. We're gonna table that talk until date four. So, there's a date four? Okay, next question. Where do you see yourself in five years? I'm an Emmy winning news producer in a big city like Chicago. Yes. I feel like that's a matter of time. It's a matter of timing, and luck, and maybe a unicorn or two. I think it's just a matter of you saying yes. What about you? Is it a full moon? Tom! Is that a full moon? Probably at Imperium National Bank. I love the job. So, when I got out of college, I didn't know what I wanted to do, and they took a chance on this loudmouthed, opinionated, desperate to please 22 year old, and they mentored me, and they gave me an opportunity to build something in my department. Not only that, they're this massive institution, and so I feel like there's lots of... Possibilities? Yeah. I know it sounds lame to... No. It doesn't sound lame. It sounds brave. Never really thought of it that way. We are really bad at smalltalk. I get why you'd would want to be loyal, but I just can't get those stories out of my head. Well, I'm not saying I don't believe the stories are real, I'm just saying, I find it very hard to believe that the company I know would do that. It makes sense. Hey, I wanna talk about when I'm gonna see you again. I'm free Saturday. All right. I have my niece's birthday party in the morning, and then I have this big gala thing in the evening? Well then, what about next week? I don't want a wait a week to see you. How about I could swing by and scoop you up on the way back from my sister's house? Has anyone ever told you you might have a slight problem with over-committing? Only every day of my life. Come on. I don't want to pile on to your already crazy day with... You're not. You are worth making time for. I'm asking, which means you have to say yes, and I don't feel about that one little bit, because I know you'd only be saying no for my sake. Right? Yes. Saturday. Yes! Goodnight, Tom. Goodnight. To understand this story, let me take you back to last year. Hey! I was just working on my Story Slam. So, I am going to try and word this very carefully so it is not an invitation. Freedom of choice is very important here. Okay? I was thinking it could be a fun adventure if, maybe you wanted to come with me today. To your niece's birthday, or the gala? Both! Look, I realize it's an insane proposition for a third date, usually to try to spread out like a big work event with meeting the family over months. Or, you know, years. You know what? This is, you don't have to do it. Now that I hear it out loud, it... What do I wear? Comfy for family, evening gown for the gala? Sorry, I realize most third dates don't usually come with a costume change. Okay, I've gotta figure out what to wear. I'll see you in 30. It's not too late to back out. We can still hop back in the car and hightail it across the border to Canada. - Uncle Tommy! - Uncle Tommy! Hey! Thank you, my loves. You must be Kelly. Hi! Thank you for letting me crash. Come on in, I'll introduce you to everyone. Yeah, let's go inside, it's freezing. When, last night? So much fun. Everybody, this is Kelly, she is a friend of Tommy's, so make her feel welcome. Hi, Kelly! Okay, Kelly, this is our birthday girl Angie, and this is Emmie, and girls, this is my new friend, Kelly. So, she has a super cool job. She actually is in charge of a TV show. Really? Kelly? Would you mind giving me a hand with the cake? Yeah, sure thing. Okay, show me what you got so far. So, meeting the family on date three. This is really throwing you into the lion's den. Normally that would be a hard pass, but this family came pretty highly reviewed. And he's pretty great. Yeah, we'll keep him. You know, Tommy's always running around and thinking about everyone else. That sounds about right. Takes really good care of us. But he doesn't always show us him, you know? What's really going on in his life. So, for him to bring you here, he must really like you. I know you've been running around all January, and so I thought a little R&R might be in order. I'm going out on a limb here, but I thought we might find the perfect hybrid between relaxing and competitive vibes. It's perfect. It's really perfect. Okay. Come on in. You pick out a game, and I'm gonna go grab us a hot chocolate and... Make it two. You got it. All the board games, and she chose checkers. Checkers is the perfect game. Lower bar to entry that chess, but it lets you know who your opponent is. And when I picked a board game bar... You had no idea what you unleashed. In the spirit of relaxation, I'm gonna say a total ban on all work talk. Agree. All right, I have a question. Why didn't you move to Chicago? Wasn't that your childhood dream? I'm so sorry, we table that topic until date four. Yeah. But then I meet your entire family, which would've been date three, and I'd say now we're solidly on date four. That's what I get for full steam ahead, huh? I was kinda hoping you'd forget that little detail. That's what you get for dating a news producer. I don't know. I guess, I always liked the idea of Chicago, but the reality of leaving my family seemed hard. Your family seems really supportive. They are, and they are, it's just, Sheila's raising two kids by herself, she basically helped raise me. And it's not like I'm saying that she's all alone in this big family, but I don't know, I just feel better knowing that I'm there. And besides, I can't just move to Chicago because I feel like it. I need to know that there's a reason, or a job... Or a plan, Mr. Possibilities? Not a plan, per se, I just need to know that I'm moving towards a goal, you know? That there's something specific there that I want. Look, I think our reactions to chaos are very opposite. I tend to slow down and pull back, and you keep on moving. But I think the struggle, the fear to name what we want, I think that's the same. I really do. But hey, you actually made a resolution. You got out there, you went curling, you went speed dating. You carpe'd the cheese fries. So, now that we're almost at the end of the month, what do you want? You know, when I made the resolution, it was pretty clear. But, a lot can happen in a month. What sage said that? That's like, really wise. We have to leave in 15 minutes. Are you producing our date? Maybe. How are you doing in there? Car's gonna be here in two minutes. Hey, if I'm going undercover, I need to look the part. I'm kidding, Tom. But, while we're on the subject, one of our sources brought in some paperwork, and it looks like the salespeople are opening accounts under the customer's name, and sending statements to their own personal addresses to cover it. Okay. So you feel like that's the most likely scenario? It's not my job to assume the best in people. I feel really weird talking to you about this without being able to read your face. Can we open the... Not ready yet! Okay. So, what's holding you back from just running the story? It'd be better if we could get a confirmation from the inside. I can just take some of the sales team out for drinks. I do that all the time. Okay. If this is gonna work, you cannot say anything to anyone. Yeah, I can do that. It's actually kind of exciting. I feel like I'm an undercover reporter. Seriously, Tom. The only way this works is if you and I are on the same page. We have to trust each other. You'd have to come to me first. Yeah, I get that. I feel really anxious, I haven't dressed up this fancy in a long time. I'm sure you look... Please finish that sentence. Breathtaking. Thanks. The obstacle course was a bit more of a challenge than I thought, but once I got the hang of it... Would you like to dance? How could I say no? Thank you for being open to adventure today. If I'm honest, out of all of the New Year's adventures I've had, today was probably the wildest. Really? So, your Saturday's don't typically involve four course meals and formal wear? It's more of a Tuesday thing. What's wrong? Just... Everywhere I look, I just keep seeing reminders of the thing that might come between us. It's hard to stay in the bubble. I think it's all a matter of what you focus on. So, you could let your eyes drift to the sharp, yet sophisticated Imperium National Bank logo... Did you design it? I did, yeah. Naturally. You could focus on the delicious food, the flowers, this amazing band who is playing this incredibly romantic song. The charming dance partner? Who can't take his eyes off you. What else should I focus on? Cozy bars filled with boardgames and books, paper lanterns, cruising in the slow lane. Winning bets. Texts at midnight. Napkins in pockets. And that, that's a good thing to focus on too. To Imperium National Bank. Cool, thank you guys for letting me pick your brains. Hey, as long as the appetizers are on you, we'll tell you whatever you want. Honestly, the biggest problem is that these customers don't know what's good for them. Sometimes you just have to... Paul. He's just stressed because these quotas have been really hard to meet lately. Yeah, it seems like sales goals have been pretty high, so I'm hoping that with the right events, we can bring in more people. It's not the number of people, it's the amount of product. I don't understand. So, each account, each credit card, it's a different product. So you could have 10 customers with an account each, or you could have one customer with two checking accounts, a savings account, a CD, a couple credit cards? Okay, so you're saying that it's about finding the right customers. It's quality over quantity. Right. We want to be the one stop shop for everything. You know, plus it doesn't hurt that we get a fee on every account we open. Right, that's... Paul, what did you mean when you said that the customer doesn't know what's good for them? This is bad, this is... Fraud. Yeah. I really didn't think it was true. So, what did Glenn say? I haven't told him yet. But you are gonna tell him, right? Kelly made me promise that I would come to her first. If you go to her first, she's gonna blow this thing right up. I promised her I would go to her first. If I break this promise, then this is over. Come on. You love what you do, and you're great at it, and you do a lot of good for the community. If you don't go to Glenn first, all of that goes away. I'm just looking out for you. But this isn't about me anymore, this is 20 people that we know of. It could be hundreds, it could be thousands. Or it could not. It could be three bad eggs. What if you go to Glenn, and there's a way to make this right without damaging the company's reputation? She still trusted me with her story. And she'll still have a story. Only this one's gonna be about the employees that went rogue, and the company that did the right thing for its customers. I mean, everyone wins, everyone's happy. Right? Hey. You made it, yay! Wouldn't miss it. To be honest, I was a little surprised about the Gatsby theme. This is vintage Kelly. Back in college, getting her to go out with us was like pulling teeth, but a theme party? You couldn't keep her home. And Gatsby? What can I say? The key to the girl's heart is books and boardgames. You made it! Hey! Yeah, of course, I wouldn't miss it. You look, wow. This is for you. You didn't have to. Of course I did. Okay, so, they worked with the original artist's grandson to restore the illustrations, and then this is a brand new, never before seen cover. It's perfect. Yeah? I love it, thank you. You knocked it out the park, my guy. Well done. Thanks. Okay, I would love to make a toast. To Kelly, on your 30th, marking the end of the perfect grand experiment to end your 20s. You are an inspiration to your whole community, the best friend we could ask for, and braver than you even know. To an amazing year to come. No. To an amazing decade. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers, cheers. So, resolution's over. How do you feel? I was within and without simultaneously, enchanted and repelled, by the inexhaustible variety of life. Okay. Did nobody here read "The Great Gatsby" in high school? - Yeah. - Read what? Yeah, absolutely. I love you guys. Come on, let's go dance. Wait, Kel, I... You heard the birthday girl, let's move. Word to the wise, Kelly won't let anyone avoid the dance floor for long. You ready? You go ahead, I'm not feeling the whole dance floor thing right now. I have a feeling the birthday girl's not gonna take that for an answer. It's kinda nice though. I've never seen her this happy before. You're right, it's a celebration, come on. Let's go! Thanks for the coffee. Yeah. Birthday surprises just keep on coming. Yeah, I'm the gift that keeps on giving. Welcome. Hey, look, yesterday at work before the party, I wanted to talk to you. Sorry, it's Casey, my reporter, I'll just be a second. Actually, wait, Kelly. Hey, Case, what's up? Wait, wait, wait, slow down, slow down. What do you mean they closed all the accounts? Well, we have the record, so I'm not worried. If anything, it makes them look a lot worse than we thought. Okay. Well, figure it out, and call me back. So Imperium National Bank closed all the accounts in question. They closed them. What do you mean they closed them? Did they reach out to the customers first? I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt here and ask if you think the timing is suspicious? No, hey, I took the sales team out for drinks, and after they spilled, I thought there might be a way to try and... I'm supposed to protect my sources. Yeah. To advocate to these people by getting the story. You giving the bank a head's up so they can sweep it under the rug... No, that's not what happened here. I went to them to try to fix it. I asked them to fix it. They were never gonna fix it. They might! The people I know there, I trusted them to do the right thing. I should've trusted my gut. I knew that there was one way that this was gonna end if I came straight to you. At least this way, there's a chance that everyone can have a... Happy ending? I like that you always try to find the good in everything. I really do. But that fantasy is preventing you from standing up for what's right. And what's worse, is you tried to fix it without even coming to me. You got me out, and tried to swoop in with some knight in shining armor routine. You can't even be honest with me? I'm sorry, but I can't do this. Tom. Hey, Glenn. I want to thank you, for your discretion regarding that news story. You're a real team player. Thank you, sir. You spared us a PR nightmare. This kind of foresight is exactly what we'd expect out of a director. Something to think about for the spring reviews. We like to reward that kind of loyalty. Absolutely. Thank you, sir. Hey, Glenn. Out of curiosity, what happens next? Well, Paul and Al will do some seminars with HR, and our communications team is drafting a statement, so that should nip it in the bud. Most of those names that I gave though, they weren't Paul and Al's clients, and those were just the ones that we knew about. So, I mean, shouldn't there be some kind of investigation or... Tom, you're a good guy. You've done great work for us, you've proven your loyalty, and you're on track for a big promotion. I'd just stay in your lane. Keep your eye on the prize, okay? We'll handle it. And if you could forward me the links for the interviews, that would... Be great, thanks. Hey. I told you, we can't. I didn't come here for us. I just wanted you to know that I quit my job this morning. If you need someone to go on record, I'm willing to do that. I didn't ask you to do that for me. I know. It's the right thing to do. Okay. Let's get you ready for pre-tape. Come on. Stand by, queue. Queue standing by. Rolling. Here we go. Good morning, Milwaukee. Today we start with a special report, fraud, at Imperium National Bank. I'm joined today by a former member of the Imperium National Bank marketing team, Tom Malone. Good morning, Tom. Good morning. Thank you for having me, River, I wish it were under better circumstances. Tom, how widespread is this? Is it happening at other banks? Well, without a proper investigation there's no way of saying how widespread the practice is. The biggest question coming out of this is how could this have happened at such a respected institution? Right. Our costumers trusted us, and we broke that trust. Every sales culture is competitive, but when there's unreasonable expectations, that can cause people to operate from desperation. I hope Imperium sees this as an opportunity to both reflect, and to do what's right for its customers. It's officially gone viral. Breaking from Milwaukee today, the fraudulent practices of local Imperium National Bank salespeople. Cracked the case in a nationwide scandal, where a high pressured sales culture drove employees to... Create fake accounts under customer names. We go live to Imperium's headquarters in New York where Brian Vantana is on the scene. Brian. What did I tell you? Yes! Door's open! We got a call about a complaint at this address? What happened in here? Tom sent the flowers, and the board game. Listen, I called this group hang because I need to talk to you about something. We've talked about it, and we all unanimously agree you should give Tom another chance. No, that's not what I want to talk about. Wait, seriously? Unanimously? Yeah, and all your reasons for being upset are valid. Totally. But I think he was coming from a good place. I mean, misguided, but good. Which counts for something. Plus, he ultimately did the right thing. Plus, plus, you're so happy when you're with him, we just... But I can't get back together with Tom. Wait, but... Because I think I'm moving to Chicago. When the story went national, they offered me a job at Good Morning Chicago. And what did you tell them? I mean, I was thinking of saying yes. Yeah, yeah. But I don't know, now I'm all in my head about Tom. Chicago's a two hour drive away. If you want to fix things with Tom, this move is not gonna be the end of the world. Plus, there's a Six Flags like right in the mid-point of the, it's... I don't know. My gut is screaming yes, but my head is, I don't know, what if I'm not ready? What if my dream job actually turns out to be a nightmare, or what if... Hey, we have watched you put yourself out there all month, and you have flourished. You're doing that storytelling competition tomorrow, you broke a national news story. You fell in love. All those things sounded terrifying at Christmas, and yeah, some of them came with really hard bumps. Would you change any of it? So, here's what we're gonna do. Jackson's gonna go buy some boxes and packing tape, I'm gonna get that pizza, while you run through tomorrow night's storytelling piece for us. But first, you're going to call Good Morning Chicago and tell them that today is their lucky day. I'm glad you guys feel that way, because I called them this afternoon and said yes. She's going to Chicago! We're going to Six Flags! Group hug! The truth is, I was hiding behind no. It was safe in a bubble of what was familiar, and easy to tell myself I was doing well when I was risking so little. But my friends showed me that by playing it small, I was only leaving space for fear. So, when I fell in love with Tobias, let's call him, I realized I was only vividly imagining all the ways things could go wrong, and not open to all the exciting things that could go right. Possibilities I hadn't even thought of. I've done a lot of things this past month that have challenged me, but falling in love... I wouldn't change a thing about it. All right, that was Kelly Leone. Absolutely fantastic. And now, let's give a warm Story Slam... Yeah, yeah, sure. Thank you. Hi there, everybody. I'm Tobias. So, Kelly's favorite book when she was growing up was "The Velveteen Rabbit". Now, there's this part in the story where the character of the Skin Horse explains how you become real. And he says, "By the time you're real, "most of your hair has been loved off, "your eyes drop out, but none of that matters at all, "because once you're real, you can't be ugly, "except to people who don't understand." Before I met Kelly, I was running around, I was pleasing everyone, and never really letting them know me. Kelly is the most authentic person I've ever met. She made me real. She made me check in with my gut, and now that I'm being honest with myself, I decided to finally chase my childhood dream, and I accepted a job in Chicago, which I know, it sounds weird right now, but I promise you, I had no idea you were going there, I promise. Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. And I wanted to let you know that I'm never gonna hide myself ever again, because of you. Yeah. I'll see you in Chicago? Yes. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
