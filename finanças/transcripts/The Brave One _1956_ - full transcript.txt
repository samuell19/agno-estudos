Señor Vargas, there could be better times to bring bad news to this house. I know, I know. Muchas gracias. Manuel, gracias por todo. Lo siento mucho, Maria. Vamos. Buenas tardes, Rafael. Bueñas, Señor Palma. This is Señor Vargas, he's chief accountant for Don Alejandro. He's leaving in the morning, for Mexico City and wants to talk with you. I'm sorry to disturb you at a time like this, you know that, Rafael. It is nothing. Yes, Patron? It concerns a black cow that carries the Videgaray brand and also an "R" brand. Your name is Rosillo? Yes, Patron, and the cow you speak of is mine. She was given to me by Don Alejandro during the last Tienta. I think you misunderstood him. But she's our cow and she's old. She's so old, she's carrying her last calf right now. A calf? Leonardo you will not speak disrespectfully to the Patron. I presume you count the calf to be yours too, eh? When it is born... yes. The calf is to be mine. I'm certain the calf belongs to the ranch and I shall enter it into the books as such, when it is born. It's a bad thing, having a cow on a ranch, that belongs to someone else. Come, Palma, let's go. They won't take our cow from us or our calf either, will they? After all we have lost today, son, would it be surprising we should lose our cow also? One's whole life is a loss, my son. Diabla, where are you? Diabla! Diabla! Diabla! Diabla. Diabla, my beautiful Diabla. Pobrecito. Our calf... our new calf! - Buenas Dias, Papá. - Buenas Dias, Maria. - Where's Leonardo? - Still sleeping. Maria. Maria, come here, come here! - Leonardo. - Leonardo. Papá, lightning had struck a tree and our cow died just as I reached her. So, I brought him home. Leonardo, get dressed. It's back to school today. But I must take care of him. He'll need some help. What strength! What a voice! Like the bugles of Zapata. He'll be brave, Papa. All sons of Valiente are brave, so was our cow. You know, Father, she bawled for help. She wouldn't die until I came. The cow was brave. This will make a fine, brave bull. He knows me! Do I have to go to school today? Do I? Would you be like your parents, unable to read or write? Leonardo, you'll be late for school. He wants me to pet him. He's hungry, he wants to suckle you. Papa, can I keep him here in the house? For a time it will be necessary. Can I call him Gitano? Gitano? Gypsy? A fighting bull should have a fighting name, something to put fear into the soul. But he is a gypsy. He was all alone in the night with no mother, a wanderer in the storm. Truly a gypsy. As you wish. With such a name, he may grow up to be very clever. Gitano, Gitanito, my little gypsy. He's hungry. Come, Elisa. Leonardo, bring out your hungry gypsy. Hurry for breakfast, Gitano. Hold still, Elisa. Elisa has no motherly feelings. Enjoy your breakfast, Gitano. And now children, can you tell me whose picture is that? Benito Juárez! That is correct. And now if you look in your books, you'll find Maximillian. Maximilian sailed across the sea with the French Army to protect him and marched to the capitol and had himself crowned Emperor of Mexico. Benito Juarez, who was President of Mexico, fled to the north. Maximilian was an arch-duke and all of his relatives were of royal blood. Maximilian's father had been an emperor and his mother had been an empress. Even his brother was an emperor. Benito Juárez was an Indian. His mother was an Indian and his father was an Indian. All of his relatives were Indians and none of them could read or write. Maximilian's friends were emperors and empresses. But Juárez... the only friends he had were the Mexican people. And Juárez, the great Juárez, as Presidente of Mexico, always listened to the voice of the Mexican people. No man was so humble that the Presidente did not hear him. And that is all for today. Tomorrow we shall study Benito Juárez and Abraham Lincoln and how they worked together. Hasta mañana. Señorita Sánchez? Yes, Leonardo. I have to send a letter, Señorita. An important one. Could you be so kind as to write it for me? But you write very well, Leonardo. For such a letter as this, I don't know enough. If you would be so kind. You see, it needs big words. It's to go to Don Alejandro Videgaray. And what's the letter to be about? It has to do with a cow and a calf. The cow was of my father and... Leonardo, start from the beginning. It's about a cow and my calf. The cow was of my father... it was until it died. It was given to my father by Don Alejandro uh...because, because one day at the Tienta the young niece of Don Alejandro fell into the corral... - He's too old for that. - It's time he was weaned anyway Now you stay here until after school. Children. Leonardo! Leonardo!! Come away, Gitano. Come away, Gitano, go away! Come away! Whoops! Buenas Dias. - Buenas Dias, Señorita. Gitano, olé! Olé, Gitano, olé! Gitano! Olé, Gitano, olé! Olé, Gitano, olé, olé! Toro, toro! Olé, Gitano! Mucho, Gitano, mucho! Chihuahua. Gitano! Toro, aha, toro! Aha! Aye, ha ha ha. Toro, olé, Gitano. Toro, toro! Ay, chihuahua. Olé, Gitano, olé. Olé, olé! Toro, olé. olé. Olé Olé, Leonardo. Leonardo! What is this I see. Just playing with Gitano. - Playing?! You were working him with a cape. What's wrong with that? You should know better. No animal on earth learns faster than a fighting bull. He must never be played with a cape. He will know where the cape is and where the matador's body is before he ever enters the ring. Then when his time comes to enter the ring, he will not be a true straight charging bull as contracted for. He will be an assassin, he will be a murderer! It's against the law. But I don't want Gitano to go to the ring. We can't send him to the ring. Not now, naturally, but when he's four years old and has come to his full strength, of course he goes into the ring. That's what he was born for, son. That's his reason in life, to fight! But that wasn't my reason when I brought him home. Just a baby,... no bigger than this! Don't trouble yourself about it. You'll grow out of it and so will Gitano, you'll see. Supper. Better wash up, son. They won't take you to the Plaza Gitano, they won't! Rafael. - Yes, Señor. I have unpleasant news. A letter from Señor Vargas. It's about Gitano. Uh huh. Gitano. He writes that it belongs to the ranch. I am instructed to have it branded with the others. This is not good, Señor Palma. It is neither good nor just. I know, amigo, ... but what am I to do? Nothing. I will get him while the boy's still at school. with your permission. That'd be very wise, Rafael. Adios, aye. - Adios. Tomorrow we study the years 1816 and 1817. That's all for today. The class is dismissed. No, Gitano! Come. Gitano, Gitano. Where are you? Gitano! Gitano! Gitano! Leonardo, ... Gitano is not ours anymore. No! ... No!! No!! Papa, is it true? Did they take Gitano away? Yes, he does not belong to us anymore. They took him away? Son, you are crying. You shame me with your tears. I am not crying! Where is he? He's amongst the herd with the rest of the calves. Leonardo! Yes? Wait until after the branding. Bring another one! Aha, toro! Aha, Gitano! Aye, Gitano! Run, Gitano! Aye, Gitano! Aha Gitano! Aye, toro, Gitano! Aye, Gitano! Mucho! Aha, toro! Careful of the horns. I would hate to be the Picador at the Tiento with this one! This is the devil, this one! Hold him tight! - Hold him. Aye, mama. The calf is not only brave, he is noble. It's hard to lose such an animal It is hard, Señor Palma. Gitano, come back. Gitano! Come back, Gitano! Leonardo... You must eat something. One cannot grieve forever. It is time for bed, Leonardo. Sí, Maria. Papa, please, Can I go see Gitano? Can I, Papa? Leonardo, my son, it is better that you forget Gitano. But can't I, Papa? Leonardo, the bull will cause you sorrow one day. It is in the nature of things that when on loves too much, one loses much. Perhaps, someday you will understand, but for tonight, you may go. Gracias, Papa! What a burden of trouble we're accumulating in this house. Gitano, Gitano! Gitano! Gitano! Gitano. Don't worry, Gitano. You belong to me. Children,... be sure not to leave anything on the ground. Leonardo, why aren't you eating? I'm not hungry, Señora Sanchez. Lunch is over children! Leonardo! After Allende and Hidalgo had been killed, the revolution against Spain went on under the leadership of Morelos. That's very good. Who knows the dates of Morelos? Leonardo? ... Leonardo! I don't know. Alright, Federico. Jose Maria Morelos, hero of the War of Independence, was born in 1765. He was a priest. In 1815, he was captured by the Spanish and brought to Mexico City, there he was executed. That's fine, Federico. That's all for today. The class is dismissed. Leonardo... I have a letter for you. It was addressed to me, so I read it, but it was meant for you. What does it say? You read it, you know what it says. It says Don Alejandro is indebted to your father and his family. It says the calf is to be yours, as you and your father wish. Gracias! Leonardo! Your books! Señor Palma! Señor Palma, I have a letter for you! What happened?! A letter from Don Alejandro. - From Don Alejandro? Yes, it says that Gitano belongs to us... to Papa and me! Read it, Señor Palma, read it! Is it not true, Señor Palma? Gitano belongs to us! True enough! It couldn't be plainer, Leonardo. Clearly, the calf is yours. Where is Gitano? On the other side of the valley with the other calves. Gracias, Señor! - Leonardo. Yes? - You better take a horse. Haven't got time! Gitano! Gitano! Gitano! Gitano! I told you didn't I. I'll never let them take you away again. Never, Gitanito. Your best clothes, Leonardo, on a Wednesday? And the face... so clean! It's a Holy day. - So. It's the day for the blessing of the animals. I'm talking Gitano to Father Valverde. That Gitano! Next he'll be going to confession. Move Burrito! Move! Do you want to miss the blessing!? Move Burrito! Move! Do you want to roast in hell? Move, move, Burrito! On your knees, Gitano, on your knees! In His holy name, I bless the innocent creatures that you have brought here today. And I pray that you will treat them with kindness. and love them as God does. And this one, being especially holy, is doubly blessed. Leonardo, you are late for your dinner. Momentito. Where have you been, son? Gitano's corral. Did you find him in good spirits? Not feverish or complaining about his food? Oh, he's fine. Not even a scratch on his horn. That's fine. Next week, Gitano will be tested at the Tienta, then everyone will know what a brave bull he is. Papa. - Huh? If Gitano passes his Tienta well, uh, I mean bravely... then couldn't we keep him on the ranch as a seed bull? My son, he's a fighting bull. It is in his nature to fight. But if he's brave, Papa, then wouldn't it be better for him to pass his bravery onto his sons instead of being killed in the ring when he's only 4 years old? He would have to be very brave indeed. But it he's brave, Papa, can't we? Leonardo, when he was born, you saved his life. When he was taken away, you got him back. If the bull is brave, you may do with him as you wish. This hacienda has been in our family over 200 years. Fascinating! To a successful Tienta. To the beautiful American señorita. You know, for a man who goes around killing bulls, you're terribly nice. The man who kills a bull is a butcher, a man who fights him is an artist. And our friend, Rivera, happens to be a very great artist indeed. Gracias, Don Alejandro. Call it art, if you like, I still say it's very brutal. - Alto! - What is it? It's one of our bulls! Bulls on the highway, very bad management. Sound the horn. Get back in your cars! Get back! It's dangerous! He's squaring up for another charge! Olé! No, no, Gitano! Tonto, you fool! Take that, Gitano! You criminal! Gitano, no Gitano! You assassin! You murderer of automobiles! You assassin! Take that, Gitano, you... Are you, ... are you Don Alejandro Videgaray? I am. I am Leonardo Rosillo, the son of Rafael Rosillo, who has the honor to be one of your vaqueros, Patron. I'm delighted to meet you, Leonardo. My friends, Miss Randall, Señor Rivera. How do you do? And now may I ask the name of "your" friend? This is Gitano. It is the bull given to us by yourself, Patron. This bull has always been a well behaved animal... until today when he attacked your automobile. This is what comes of giving animals away. I warned you. The fenders have been hurt. And the car has been blinded in both headlights. True... but on the other hand, It takes a very brave bull to inflict such punishment. Oh! Oh, he's very brave, Patron. He's to be tested tomorrow at the tienta. Now, as to the injuries, Patron, we are poor, but I shall work all my life to pay for what this, this unwise animal has done today. It is of no account, Leonardo. I am always glad to see a spirited bull and, uh, as for the injuries, ... don't worry. I'll take care of it. You are serious, Patron? - Very serious... but there is one more problem, Leonardo. Name it Patron, name anything. It will be a great convenience if you would remove your friend so that we may proceed to the ranch. At once, Patron. Quiet you bandit!! All your life, Patron, we'll be at you service. Andale, criminal! Hasta luego, Patron. Hasta luego, Leonardo. Hasta luego. Frijoles... tacos... bueno. Now, the tienta begins. Watch! To warm things up. We always let the village boys try out their cape work with the female calves. Maria, I've been given permission to stand by while the bulls are being tested No, Manuel, you'll be hurt. Nonsense! Do you know who's up there to watch my work? Rivera himself! Rivera? - Up there, beside the señorita. Salud! She pays more attention to him than to Don Alejandro. Is that why you want to be a matador, Manuel? So rich girls will admire you? I want no rich girls. I want only you and to be like him, the greatest bullfighter since Joselito. And Joselito was killed. - Gaona then. Gaona was the greatest of them all and he still lives. And his whole body full of scars. Scars, ... They are the glory of Mexico! You say we are cruel to the bull. Yet, here at the tienta, as you will see, we simply test the two year old animals for their courage. The bull takes the pick only once and in three days, he has healed completely. I'm afraid we're just not used to it. My dear señorita, you Americans knock each other senseless in the prize ring and that is not cruel. Forty Englishmen and a hundred dogs, hunt down a little fox and that isn't cruel. Only the bullfight is cruel, or is it? Well the way you say it, sounds reasonable enough but still to an American... I grant you an American wouldn't understand. We Mexicans are a different and older race. We know there is pain in all life, and that death is never very far away, but you, your people are always outraged at pain and as for death, I think you might pass a law against it any day. Palma! Si, Señor? - The first one. Oh, I just know I'm not going to understand any of it. It's very simple. - Now watch and I'll explain. There is a picador. He stands perfectly still because the bull, if he is brave, must charge of his own accord without any goading. Once in awhile, they even knock the horse over, although that's very rare for two-year olds. He is bluffing, why's it been so long without a fight? Mouse! Aha toro! That's no good, Don Alejandro. Well, a little better. Señor Palma, no good, eh? He might do for a novillada Oh no, no. We couldn't send a creature like that under our colors. Put him down for beef. You mean he's going to be killed just because he doesn't want to fight? I think that's cruel. Don't worry, Gitano. The pick won't go in deep and if it does, charge him. Gitano! Olé, Gitano! Now we have it! Olé, Gitano! Gitano, olé! Gitano! Olé, Gitano! Aha Toro! This bull, although it is not listed as ranch property, nevertheless it carries the Videgaray brand and no other. Gitano! Alto, toro! Manuel. Manuel! Manuel! Mija. - Manuel, Manuel! Gitano, oh, Gitano! I am so glad you have been able to come. Please darling, fetch me a drink, will you? Yes. You find him interesting, don't you? Not really. Well, whatever choice you make, your heart will be broken. Here we are, champagne. Matador. - Señorita. Salud. - Salud. How is Manuel? How is he? He will get well, but he will never be able to work with the bulls again. Maria... and Gitano did it. Gitano did it. Hush, Leonardo. I'm sick in my heart for Manuel, for his pain and his disappointment. But I... I'm glad for it too. - Glad? This way, he lived with death for only a moment. But if he had become a matador, he would have lived with death all his life. Now, he can live with life and we can be married. And if it had to be your Gitano that saved him for me and for himself, then I think I shall love Gitano from now on, as much as you do. And so señoras and señores, Mexico's brilliant young torero, Fermin Rivera, is circling the ring after being awarded Spain's world famous Golden Ears, as the outstanding matador of the year. Today is another great triumph for Fermin Rivera. Two years ago, he won the Golden Ears in Madrid. Last year, the Rose of Guadalupe here in the Plaza de Mexico. Today, in this same plaza, thousands of his admirers defying all efforts of the police, are swarming into the ring and carrying him on their shoulders on the plaza. And now I take great pride in presenting our dear friend, Señor De La Garza, Inspector of our school district. Friends, we've come to the most important part of our little ceremony today. Three of our students, the largest graduation class in the history of our school, have today completed their first six years of their education. Their parents have sacrificed much to send them to school through these six years. And they themselves have worked very hard. I am honored now to present the first diploma to Maria Teresa Mendason. Thank you. - Congratulations The second goes to Leonardo Miguel Rosillo. Congratulations That's my son. And the third and the last to Frederico Sanchez Ventura. Frederico, come here. Amigo. - SÍ. Luis... - What is it? It was just today it happened... Leonardo, bring the diploma. Look at the seal and ribbons. Look at the fine ribbon. His record, while not the best, was good. Out of the largest graduation class in the history of Mexico, he is still third. The young people are smarter these days, Rafael. Yes, indeed! You know something, Luis... Where did he go? Leonardo, give some wine to Señor Lopez. It isn't always that we graduate. Papa!... Papa! Attención, señores, the auction of the Videgaray Estates will now start. Now, señores, this is a great opportunity to buy the bravest bulls and the finest breeding stock in all of Mexico. Today and tomorrow we will auction all properties of the late Alejandro Videgaray. Tomorrow, the prime four year olds, certified and ready for the ring, will be offered. Included will be Cortijero, Negrito, Gitano, Barbaroso, and other sons of the great Valiente. These are the last of the Videgaray brand. Señores, come with me. The auction will begin with the ranch equipment. Maria! Papa! Maria! The letter says Gitano is mine! Where is it?! I can't remember. I can't remember! Come, Gitano! Pobrecito. Leonardo! I have come for you! Papa! You must come home, son, and bring the bull with you. Two men are here with me. You must come. They have a paper from the Alcalde. We had a paper too. We're being robbed! Why are you afraid of their paper? Why do you cringe before them like a dog? I do what I must, like all men. You will not insult me anymore, I am your father. Now pick up your things and come. Father - Yes. I'm grieving for what I said. Now this is a great opportunity. This magnificent animal, is the son of Valiente. Gitano Make me a bid. Six thousand! Six thousand?! for this fine bull?! Seven thousand! Seven thousand pesos, do I hear more? Alright, sold! Señor! Señor Vargas! - Well, what is it? That is our bull, given to us by Don Alejandro. You may not sell him! He is not yours! The court has ordered all Videgaray bulls sold. That animal carries the Videgaray brand. Señor, you cannot. I forbid it! Don Alejandro wrote us a letter saying he was ours. If that's so? It's strange he should carry the Videgaray brand. Uh, Pepe, do you know anything about a letter changing title on Gitano? At the tienta, he was listed as a Videgaray bull. You see, I'm very busy now and the bull has already been sold. If you have the letter, I'll be glad to read it. But I, I don't know whether I have it. It happened a long time ago. No brand, no letter... very careless. Put the bulls in the trucks. They leave for Mexico City tonight. Here. We don't stop until we get to the bullring? Yeah. Hey, chamaco, you don't knock? Perdoname, Señor, I must go to Mexico and I just thought maybe there would be some room. Ah, you thought well. Sit down. You live in these wilds? Yes. - Excuse me. This is to be your first trip to Mexico City? Sí. - Aye You will like it. I've lived there all my life. I'm a native of Mexico City. My father lives there, my sister-in-law lives there and my brother, everybody. It is the most beautiful city in the world. Paris is a slum beside it. Señor, you've been to Paris, also? Certainly not! Now why should I go to Paris when I already live in Mexico City? Aye We'll be there in the morning. Good night, no snoring. I'm a very light sleeper. - Gitano. Chamaco Buenas Dias, chamaco. Buenas Dias, señor. We're coming into Mexico City! Here ... take a look. There it is. Queen city of the western world. And what street did you say it was, please? The Paseo de la Reforma! You must be a blockhead, never to have heard of the most famous boulevard in the world! And what is that? Oh, muchacho, what a donkey you are! That is the monument to our independence. Really? There it is, chamaco. The Plaza de Mexico. Absolutely the biggest bullring in the world. Gitano, Gitano. Gitano, it's going to be alright. You stay here, I'll take care of everything. No. Your case is not very hopeful, chamaco. The man who contracts with these bulls, I know very well. No. I think your story was not touching. But who is he? What is his name? Well, chamaco... he's Doctor Gaona, the empresario, a most vigorous man with money. But where can I find him? Downtown at the ticket office, at the Plaza de Mexico. Gracias. Chamaco, it is almost noon. The fights are at 4 o'clock! You haven't much time! - Gracias. Hurry, chamaco. - Muchas gracias, señor. Hurry! Señor, is Doctor Gaona here? Where can I find Dr. Gaona? - Allá! Señor, is Dr. Gaona here? - Isn't here. But I must find him. - Isn't here, I tell you! I must find him. - Go away, next please. "And Juárez, the great Juárez, as Presidente of Mexico, always listened to the voice of the Mexican people." "No man was so humble that the Presidente did not hear him." The Presidente, the Presidente! Hey, come back here! Now, what's the rush? - Please, señor, where is Chapultepec Castle? Castle? Why it's in Chapultepec Park, of course. Where's that? - Way over there. You can't miss it. - Gracias, señor. And watch yourself, chico. I've come to see the Presidente. Where is he, please? of what? The Presidente of Mexico, that is. I'm afraid you're a little mixed up boy. He does not live here. But Juárez lived here when he was Presidente. True, but the castle is now a museum. Gracias. - De nada. Taco? Taco, muchacho? Excelsior, El Universal, the news! I'm looking for the Presidente of Mexico. Presidente of what? Of Mexico. I've got to see him. Well, I guess you have to go to the National Palace. Where's the National Palace? Keep right on down Juárez, then it changes to Madero, keep right on down Madero til you come out on the Zócalo. Over to this end of it, that's the cathedral. Look right straight across, that's the National Palace. Gracias, señor. - Por nada. El Excelsior! Now, ladies and gentlemen, we take you to the Plaza Mexico for our regular Sunday afternoon broadcast of the fights. Atención, señores and señoras, today the Plaza de Mexico brings you a mano a mano competition tour of Mexico's greatest matadors. Fermín Rivera and Carlos Veras, fighting four of the greatest of the Videgaray bulls. Cortijero, Gitano, Valeroso and Negrito. The Presidente? The first fight, señores and señoras, Carlos Veras will fight the 365 kilo Cortijero. Olé! El Presidente. Were you looking for someone? - Yes, if you please, señora, I'm looking for the Presidente. Oh, but it's Sunday, you see. The offices are closed. Closed? But I must find him. Today, the Presidente is at his home, Los Pinos. Oh... gracias. The second fight, señores and señoras, Fermín Rivera will fight the 370 kilo Valeroso. Halt! What is it? Is this where I can find the Presidente? What do you want with the President? It's about something very important. Could you tell me how I could get into the house? See the Officer of the Guard. Can you tell me how I can see the Presidente? I'm afraid it can't be done. But I've traveled so far. Please help me! But I tell you it's impossible. Now run along. Rivera performs with great beauty. "Rivera is tremendous! What a fight! The bull is charging again. A thousand pounds of danger bearing down on Rivera. He places..." "Olé! A magnificent set of passes! The crowd is going wild! Rivera is now lining up the bull for the kill, he plays the bull into position, he raises his sword... the perfect kill! Olé, Rivera! Once again. Rivera has shown that he is of the greats. Listen to that roaring ovation! Eighty five thousand people paying tribute to the skill and beauty of one man." Are you looking for someone, young man? Señor Presidente? Yes, are you lost? No, Señor Presidente. Señor... Señor, I have traveled so far to see you about Gitano. Gitano? - Yes, It is the bull of my father and me, given to us by Don Alejandro Videgaray. Now they have taken my Gitano to the Plaza de Toros and he's going to be killed. You must save him, you must save him! You must not let him die! Señor, you must save Gitano! Father Valverde himself blessed him and they cannot kill a blessed animal. They cannot kill him! The third fight, señores and señores, Carlos Veras will fight the 375 kilo Negrito. I cannot order Dr. Gaona to save your bull, my son, I can only ask him to and hope that he will. Here's your letter. - Muchas gracias. Gracias, Señor. Muchas gracias! You must hurry, Leonardo, if you are to be in time. Gracias, Señor and my father will pray for you every day. I shall need his prayers. Quick! Where is Dr. Gaona? Gracias. The fourth fight, señores and señores, Fermín Rivera will fight the 385 kilo Gitano. Please, Señor, where is Dr. Gaona? Dr, Gaona, I have a letter for you. Oh please, after. But Dr. Gaona, it's important. Oh! come quick! Don't open number four! Chamaco. Gitano is a fine bull. Very noble bull, chamaco. The bull doesn't seem to tire. To have had such a bull, that alone is enough. Rivera's placing his own banderines. Heh hey. Heh hey. Heh hey. He begins his run. Heh hey, heh hey. We have reached the tercio of death and Rivera must take the muleta and the sword. He's dedicating the kill to the public. Heh hey... The muleta work is phenomenal! Rivera is magnificent. Rivera works too close to the bull. He catches Rivera. The braid is ripped. But he's alright! He's sighting the bull for the kill. He misses! Ladies and gentlemen, this Gitano's a truly wonderful bull. He doesn't hook, he charges clean, but he holds his head too high. The blade cannot to home. Rivera is down! Berniño and Conitas are there with their capes. Berniño takes him away. Rivera is not gored! "Indulto, indulto!" Wait a minute... somewhere I hear people beginning to call for an indulto They wish the bull to be spared. That's very unlikely. The only indulto I remember was in Monterrey in 1937. Indulto! Indulto! Indulto! Our fifteen minutes for the tercio of death is almost over. Rivera sights! Rivera was not ready and the bull charged! Reviño takes the bull away and Rivera rises. Rivera was not gored! Gitano is the noblest bull I've ever seen. Indulto! Indulto! Indulto, indulto! Up in the President's box, the officials are conferring. Rivera's sighting again. "INDULTO! INDULTO!") Atención! Atención! The indulto has been granted! Gitano! Gitano! Gitano! Gitano! Now we can live, Gitano. My little gypsy. Now we can live.
