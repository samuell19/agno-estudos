Crucified Girl (Germany 1929) Directors: Louise Kolm-Fleck, Jacob Fleck The only film version of CRUCIFIED GIRL that can still be detected today is a historical 35mm nitrate copy of a shortened French rental version from the collection of the Departmental Council of Charente in Angoulême with a length of 2132 metres. The original length of the German premiere version was 2389 metres. The philological restoration by the Film Archive Austria aimed to reconstruct the original version based on the picture elements of the shortened French version with newly set German intertitles from the German imperial censorship card. Those intertitles that had been inserted into the French version were removed. The digital restoration aimed at reproducing the source situation as authentically as possible. It included the digitization of the source material in a 4k resolution, the stabilization of the image position according to the copied camera section of the original negative, the compensation of density fluctuations, an adjustment of the grayscale and a 2K mastering. Thanks to the Departmental Council of Charente in Angoulême. CRUCIFIED GIRL (Mary's Passion) A Tragedy in Seven Acts Writer: Ludwig Fritsch Directors: J. and L.

Erwin von Oehringen... Lino Pavanelli. Karl Messner, a depraved individual... Wolfgang Zilzer. Bruno Hesse, a literary agent... Fritz Odemar. Erna, his second wife... Valerie Boothby. Please let me sleep. Mary, Hesse's daughter from his first marriage... Evelyne Holt. She's sleeping. The poor thing has to work late into the night. Since she's more spoiled than your late mother, she must earn her own clothes. Don't I get a morning kiss today? School holidays --- today is the end of the semester for me too! If my exams turn out well, I have a free place again for next year. Karl Messner, a depraved individual... Wolfgang Zilzer. I have to get that girl. Hans Lucius, a student... Ernst Verebes. Meeting place: Wannsee Street 8 - Villa Hermine! I'd rather not, it's so easy to get used to noble passions, which one can hardly do without later. Erwin von Oehringen... Lino Pavanelli. I still have to manicure and do the hair of a few female customers, so I won't be home until late. Besides, you know that I have to earn my own money. Do you get home this late? How dare you? I don't have to answer to you. It hurts my feelings that I cannot offer my wife what she has to earn herself through her hard work. Mrs. Lucius, his mother... Gertrud de Lalsky. This was left for you. Do you love her too? I don't know, Mother. Maybe?! Your engagement is to take place in the shortest possible time. You should only get married after you have finished your studies. I have been engaged by a theatre group for a few days and have to leave immediately. But take it easy and don't work so much. I'm going to miss you so much. I found this bag under the stairs yesterday. Why did you hide it there? Thanks. I don't wear clothes like that. You can't accompany me to the train because I have to join the directorate. Day Do you know where it is now? Right - there it is! There's nobody home. You can give me the bouquet for Miss Mary. This is from your sweetheart. Have you already told your father that we're getting married?! Fine, then I'll talk to your father and wait here until he comes. I won't wait long, though! Miss Hesse, you are wanted on the telephone. I'll pick you up now... No - no - I'll be right over! Have you received my roses? I thank you, you have given me great pleasure... Thanks - maybe my wife would be interested? You lied to me shamefully. Did you know she's married? Whore! You'll have to marry me! That's all I need! You lied to me quite a bit. Then you have to give me severance pay! An evening gown for the next connection. It will do you good to spend a few days on the estate after the long and exhausting studies. I'd love to - but I can't leave my father alone. You've changed, Mary. You're quite different today than you used to be. I'll go with you, Mary! That's my girl! There seems to be some mistake. Ask Mary, she was with me in the summerhouse. Mary! I'm glad you're coming to me. I came to get even with you. Get even with me? Nothing can happen to me! That's why I'm innocent, Hans. His crime is driving me to my death. Forgive me! I love you and live only for you! Your dying Mary. You've done me wrong. If you had listened to me, you'd be convinced of my innocence. You can't imagine how you've made me suffer. My poor, innocent child. First day of school --- and I have to die... The End.
