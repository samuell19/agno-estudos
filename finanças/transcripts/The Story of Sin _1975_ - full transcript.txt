I do not recall having committed any venial sins. St. Ciprian calls virgins "fragrant flowers of the church, embellishments of human nature. The perfect work of that nature immune to corruption. Representation of the Creator's holiness." Thou art indeed pretty, but that is not thy doing. Yet, to achieve a beautiful soul is within thy power. Try to make thy soul as beautiful as thy flesh. Close your eyes to the sight of sin. But what is sin, Father? Sin is an evil deed. But how will I know it? It must be a deliberate act. He who does wrong, raises his hand against God. Sin is an of fence against God. Its inner cause is imagination and lust. Its outer cause is another man or Satan. Satan clouds man's mind, quickens his imagination and incites lust. Never read books which spread sin. Look not at obscene paintings. Avoid things which may be charming outside but filthy inside. Now, finally; when thou walkest in the street, men watch as you pass them. Am I right? Yes. The looks of these strangers arouse in you a strong feeling. A feeling it is hard to describe. You must not respond to those looks with joy. Do this and you attain what St Paul calls "Love and the spirit of meekness". But father, isn't that selfish? Can love be selfish? Enjoying wealth and happiness in the face of misery is a selfish thing. Pray, and thou wilt not be deprived of mercy if you make now a solemn promise to reform. STORY OF SIN Based on the novel by Stefan Żeromski Written by: With: Directed by: ADOLF HORST - PHILOSOPHER Do not ring. Ever! - Are you angry with me? - Angry? Of course not. - Did you see Father Jutkiewicz? - Yes. - And Holy Communion? - It was late. I'll go tomorrow. Can you last a whole night without sin? - Come quickly! - What's up? I can't tell you. - Are you trying to annoy me? - All right, I'll tell you. Horst has a whore in there with him. You know! That red haired creature! Lead us not into temptation. Dear Lord, I am unworthy to receive you. St. Cyprian said of women: "You ruin your neighbours to whom you are worse than poison." I can't be that bad. O, Lord, aid my humility. Hello, Daddy! Got your absolution? Did you? Why not share some of that holiness with your old dad! Why not go to confession? I will go, sweetheart I almost went the other day. Trust me! Trust me, you went to the coffee house. You grudge me one cup of coffee? - It's not just coffee. - Don't start telling me how to live my own life. Good morning. I was told you take lodgers. Yes. Come in. The room faces south west and is always warm. - How much? - Fifteen rubles a month. - Hot water? - Of course. - Service? - Included in the price. Fifteen rubles. You said how much? Fifteen? Fifteen a month. I'll take it. I'll pay in advance. I'll have my bags brought up. I'll fetch your bedding. Mind the paint. It's still wet. Don't worry, I'll be careful. May I introduce myself? Łukasz Niepołomski. Pleased to meet you. Get off! The new lodger. I'm sorry, I believe your father does the registration? I want to show my papers. Please do. Come in. Our other tenant, Mr Adolf Horst. How do you do? - You moved here from Wilcza St.? - Yes. - It's more quiet here. - Some like it quiet. Perhaps you prefer it more lively? People have different dispositions. To tell you the truth, I never gave it much thought. Good. Then you're a healthy man. In these neurotic times... Did the servants fix everything? I've done it myself. I have everything I need. - I see you are married. - Yes, I am. - Is your wife to join you? - No. If you need a bigger room or another bed... No, thanks. My wife is not coming. I am in Warsaw to arrange a divorce. Divorce?! No easy thing. Particularly with our Catholic church. - That's a hard nut to crack. - Don't I know. - I see things when I look for a job. - You're job-hunting? Yes. I've looked everywhere. Even with influential friends it's hopeless in this recession. What line are you in? I can turn my hand to anything to earn my daily bread. I used to own a farm. Then I worked in industry and various offices. Now everyone says I'm too old but I can work harder than the Devil himself! I don't know anyone here. I study overseas... - You're a student? - Yes. I'm an anthropologist. - Where do you study? - There's no place like Paris. Also Geneva or Berlin. About your job... I have a friend who's a factory owner. Kraft Jr. - Kraft? - Yes. Kraft! I know him. An idealist and a complete fool! I doubt so. Really, Mr Horst! How could you? ...31, 32, 33, 34... - Where are you going? - To church. - A penny for your thoughts? - I thought of you. What was it? - A sage keeps certain truths secret. - Who's a sage? Don't you like them? Who's a wise man? A happy man. "Sapientem solum felicem esse." Latin? I'm leaving! Please wait. I don't even know your name. Why do you want that? To tell tales about me? - About your name? - Yes! So, what is your name? Little Sun, Blessed Lips? Is it in the calendar? - I don't read calendars. - Your name! First close your eyes. Ewa. The first sinner. Ewa in Hebrew means "to exist." A charming verb in the infinitive. Ewa means life which was, is now and ever will be. Ewa is the immortal woman. The heavenly Isis, who dwells in the realms of infinity. HEAD OF EXPENDITURE - Two full sets? - Almost three. Twenty seven pages, six hundred lines, sir. I shall check it. - Father isn't back? - He will be soon. - Shall I serve? - The master's not here. Stay here! Is Ewa back? Have them come to the table. They're sweet when they profit by it. Good afternoon. So, you took that job at Kraft's? Yes, I did. Sixty rubles a month. Thanks to a little personal... introduction. Bon appétit! No more talking, now, you two. The soup is ready! Please. - Please. - No, I insist. After you, sir. Treason is everywhere. In all human souls. In all human eyes. Treason is as common as breathing. But in your eyes I see no treason. I walk across the park... - ...under a strangely transparent... - ...and I wait for you... I see stars shining like little lanterns of longing. I raise my eyes to look at them. And my thoughts are happy and radiant. The same sky is above me... - What means the world without you? - ...and above him. Should this love be lost forever. What would happen then? No! This would be the end. Without love there would be infinite waiting without hope, there would be listening to the noises and sounds. The beating of a heart moving without knowledge and understanding. I've got something for you, Miss. Thank you! - Good afternoon, Mother. - Good afternoon, Ewa. Good afternoon, madam. Good afternoon, sir. When you wrote there was no treason in my heart, it was the happiest moment of my life. You are right. There is no treason. I'll never bring confusion into your life. We 're approaching each other. Distance and longing. When will the miracle happen again? Only the two of us in time and space. The roses have faded on my breasts. I rest on fragrant fabrics in a long high room. I came to cherish souvenirs, unimportant to me before. Write your letters with margins, as I do. I'll have them all bound in a most beautiful book. A void before me and a void behind me. I burned your beloved letters a while ago. My case was heard yesterday. I lost it. I have to pay my wife higher alimony. No hope of a divorce now. I feared that. I'm leaving today. I've taken a job outside Warsaw. I won't give you my address. This is my farewell letter. I'm no weakling. I saw despair in your mother's eyes. Frankly, she begged me not to ruin your life. "View of the convent. Information on the miraculous image of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The picture, painted on canvas, used to hang..." - I want my dinner. Quickly! - What's the rush? - I'm in a hurry. - Niepołomski left? - Yes. - For good? - Yes. - Did he take leave? - Yes. - When did he go? - Today. - Where to? - He didn't say. - No. Who cares where the likes of him go? You're annoyed because your breasts are flabby! Because you're a cock-peeked wife and I'm my own self! Kraft will sack me if Niepołomski tells him to! Scolding me, Dad? You should care that I keep my hard won job! - Niepołomski and Kraft indeed! - Shut up! A ROOM FOR RENT Are you going to let it, Mother? His room? - Niepołomski's! - Are you insane? No. But I won't let you do it! If you let it to the first man who comes along I'll walk the streets and go with the first man who comes along. You must forget him or you're done for! Never! I'm a miserable wretch to be still alive. I'm not as stupid as you are. I found things out. I saw his lawyer. He'll never get a divorce! I don't care if he does or not. I wish I knew what you wanted. Nothing from you. - He'll never come back to you. - Isn't it what you wanted? You must, do you hear? Not on your life! Ewa! Listen to me. - You must forget him. - No! Never! Even if he beat and kicked me. If he dragged me by the hair. I'd still kiss his hands, and feet, and worship him. - Stop it! - If only I could see him! SCIENTIFIC MAGAZINE Łukasz Niepołomski. EDITOR - I'd like to see the editor. - No visitors today. He'll see you, miss. What can I do for you? I'm very sorry to bother you. But it's important. I study in Paris. And I'm going back soon with friends. One of them, an anthropology student, needs to contact Mr. Niepołomski. She used to work with him. He was to join our party. I understand that only you, sir, know all the scientists in town. You're fortunate. Niepołomski just wrote to me. He's at the Zgliszcza country estate. Lublin district, near Puławy. He's due in Warsaw on Wednesday. On the 7 p.m. train. You can meet him in this office. We welcome pretty, young pioneers of science. - It'll be my pleasure. - Mr. Niepołomski owns a country estate? Scientists and writers don't own estates! He's at the home of Count Szczerbic to teach the young masters. In that case he won't go to Paris. Sorry to have bothered you. - What do you study, by the way? - Medicine. I'll tell my friends how kind you were. Łukasz! Stop! Evie, sweetheart! - You here? - Why did you do it? Why? Why did you run away from me? Why this awful letter? I had to. What's the matter? I'll sleep here. I know the place. - A single room? - I'll be back. - Let's go! - What are you up to? It's late. I'll take you home. - I'm in your room now. - What a pity... It's paradise when I'm with you. I'll borrow money from the count and go to Rome. I might get my divorce there. - Really? When? - In two or three months. - When will you be back? - I will, don't worry. - Run. - Don't leave me! I'll write to your office. Back to the hotel! Dear madam, a patient of mine at the City Hospital is asking you to come at once. He's been shot in the lung. It's rather serious and there's little hope. I want some leave. My aunt's dying. Are you joking? Unpaid leave! Are you serious? I ask again! - I have a right! - I've not had a day off in 27 years. - One week, please! - Out of the question. 23, 54, 400 rubles? plus 102 makes 428 rubles. 528. 528. Good afternoon, young lady. - Coffee please. - No coffee. Only tea. - Tea then. - Take a seat. - You come from Warsaw? - Yes. I knew it! We're from Warsaw too. Delighted. - Looking for a career in this town? - None of your business. Just a friendly question. You're a smart girl! But we're not too bad either. As for cash, I can show you some. A wad! Enough to have fun for a week. Leave me alone! Airs and graces, eh? You'll beg me yet. HOSPITAL DIRECTOR OFFICE HOURS: 9 - 10 A.M. - No visitors, I said. - We'll only look at each other. - I must prepare him first. - I'll leave when you tell me to. Oh, God! These romantic loves! I had news from the lady. She's coming. Lie still! She's here already. - Quiet, I said! - Where is she? Lie down, will you? Come in. Ewa! Don't talk too much. I fought a duel with the count. Somebody stole your letters and gossipped. - So you understand? - Don't talk. Just this: he made fun of you. I slapped him, we fought and he got me. You'll be all right. - I won't. - You will, I promise. I'm going to die. Shh! Then we'll die together, my love. You mind? My defender! He hit you here? Shh! Don't talk! I won't leave you. I'll be here. Good morning, Mr. Niepołomski. - Who's she? - Comes from Warsaw. The water's boiling! A Warsaw lady. Once bitten, twice shy. Shy of the kettle, see? Good evening, Mrs. Niepołomski. A cold day, isn't it? Łukasz! - Someone broke the window. - Get in bed now! Your hands are ice cold. Playing at being a glazier? Don't worry. I'll look after you. Feed you, tuck you in, keep you warm. Why do you live like divorced people? In separate rooms? It's not done. - My husband mustn't be disturbed. - Does a wife disturb a husband? He can't sleep in company. I wouldn't sleep much in his place either. Diderot says: "Happiness and decency exist only in those countries where the law does justice to instincts." He's right! In Japan, girls have baths in front of men. - That's in Japan. - Japan's a great society. Japan! Japan! Always the same! Could a girl here do that? No! Although shame's an invention, like clothes. So is a girl's blush, you'd say? - I'll prove it. - How? On the Isle of Pines missionaries ordered girls to wear loincloths. But they kept taking them off. Animals too. We're not animals. And we don't live on the Isle of Pines! I want to teach you some anthropology. Woman's shame is the invention of man. Tonight I'll get to Vienna. I wish things got going! You didn't kiss me on the platform. You cried. I miss that kiss terribly. I know your letter by heart, like poetry. It's not a letter, but a kiss. Remember our talk last year? I love you so! I worship you! I leave Vienna tomorrow. But I won't get nearer Rome, only further away from you. I stopped for a night in beloved Florence. At the Porto Rossa hotel. I can see the Duomo. Give me some water. If I were this card, I'd be in your room soon. Resting my head on your breasts. Oh, my white breasts, my very own! On them I dreamed the golden dream of my life. How unreal it seems today - putting my lips to the divine line which separates or unites them. Rome. A date palm under my windows. The unripe fruit among its leaves. I see camellia groves as clearly as hazel woods at home. May the 25th. I've been to see the reverend fathers. Can't wait for them to review my case. O, priests, now I'm in your hands. Oh, my God! Clear the board! She'll be all right. Show some sympathy! This is no sickness. You'll see. She's coming to. There's another little lady on the way! The count! Wait for me. Mrs. Niepołomski! You're very sad, Mrs. Niepołomski. I can see that. Such a beauty shouldn't cry. Open the door, please. I'm sick. Sick with longing, isn't it so? Why are you always alone? You never go out. - Why isn't your husband with you? - He'll be back soon. Good day, sir. How can I help you? I'm here to see Ewa Pobra... Mrs. Niepołomski, I mean. Mrs. Róża Niepołomski. Róża, of course. Can I see her? Knock on her door. She may be in. I wouldn't know. Thank you. - Miss Ewa Pobratyńska? - Yes. - It's you? - Yes. Łukasz Niepołomski sent me here. Where is he? Mr. Niepołomski is in Rome. Please sit down. - Mr. Niepołomski is in prison. - In prison? Let me introduce myself: Count Szczerbic. The one who shot Łukasz? It was a matter of honour. I wounded him in a duel. So it was you. Yes. He wants me to do something. - Did he write to you? - Not personally. He asked a mutual friend to do it. What has he done? I'm not sure. My friend's rather vague. Niepołomski worked at the Austrian embassy copying some documents. He sold the most valuable ones to American antique dealers. Łukasz? They sent him to prison in May. I'm doing what he asked me to. He'll repay me when he's back. Though there's no knowing when. In any case, here's 50 rubles. Please write if you need help. Zygmunt Szczerbic. Zgliszcza estate. That will do. - Jesus! Mother of God! - Stop screaming! Miss Ewa! Where have you been so long? - Is your mistress in? - No. I mean, of course she is. But the master's out. - Where is he? - I don't know. - I don't know. - Tell me. At the pub, where else? Get out, you slut! Out! I'm not a slut, but I may become one. Don't answer back! You tramp! Stop calling me names. Shut up, you tramp! I came to see Father, not you! Wait here! Don't go to the pub! Can't she see her own father? Some mother! Get out, both of you! Don't you dare take her back! I won't have it, do you hear? Silence! Get out of my way! Or I'll kill you! I'll beat the life out of you! I'm waiting for Jan. - Good morning. - Good morning. Matted heads have been a Polish speciality for centuries. "Plica polonica!" Woe betide anyone who cuts off Poland's "plica!" The peasants will get at them. I wonder if you remember me. Could we talk? It's important. When do you call it a day? - In the evening. - Late? Rather. I'd hate you to suspect me of bad intentions. I'd like to meet you. - I'm only free on Sunday. - Until Sunday then. Allow me to leave you a little tip. Yes, of course. - He's still serving his sentence. - Tell me the whole truth. I did, upon my honour. The prison story is not an invention? - VVhose invention? - Mine. - You poor thing! - Poor? No. Only distrustful. - What's in the other letter? - He's asking how you are. - At your previous place? - You've been there? Don't be upset. I paid the Jew. - I said I'd crush him if he talked. - What about? Those debts of yours and suchlike. Why are you meddling with this? I see I've upset you. But I had to make things clear. I know that to hear it from a stranger... Stop, for God's sake! No one will ever mention it again, I promise. Now tell me, why work in that place? We'll go together. As far as Rome. I'll go on to the Riviera and you'll wait for his release. I'll cover all expenses. I owe it to Łukasz, besides... I swear I'm not scheming. - Sorry. - Not a bit. - You'll pay me back when you can. - Thank you. We'll travel in separate coaches. One more thing. I'll get your father a job at the store I own. I'll leave you now. Somebody might see us. I'm worth more than a dozen counts. You here? Though I'm only a coarse bourgeois. - A liaison here? Shocking! - None of your business. What are you up to with the count? How dare you? Let go! I don't want you in serious trouble. You're in for it. I know life. I have enough foresight, and I won't allow it. I know life too. I need no advisers. Signorina Ewa Pobratyńska! To see inmate Łukasz Niepołomski. He was released a week ago. Where is he now? He was deported to the French border. Don't be upset. I'm sure he headed to Monte Carlo. To win some money. You'd best go to Nice. I'll look for him all over France. What luck to meet you here. Any news for me? No, I'm afraid not. Though I wrote to Paris. - Are you alone here? - Yes. - Playing? - I have no luck. Let's go. It's stuffy in here. - You won't try? - I said I had no luck. You never can tell. - What about you? - I was in luck and won a lot. But I gamble carefully. I'm leaving anyway. Going home? Yes. - You mean to stay here? - Well? What can I tell you? You know all about me. Perhaps he's in Poland. He ought to look for you. But are you sure he will? I'm not suggesting anything nasty. But are you quite sure he will? - I no longer know. - You poor thing. - Stop it! - I didn't mean it. Then why say such things? I'll look for him in Warsaw, check the Jew's place. - Or your parents'. - Don't go there. All right, I won't. What am I to do? Enough! I'll stake all I possess. - Bitch! - Wait, Peter Ivanovitch! A lady to see you, count. She didn't give her name. I'll be right there. Count! - You did win, I see. - Yes. Here's 10,000. If it's more than I owe you, give the rest to Niepołomski. I have a suite in this hotel. Stay with me! Is that what your help came to? - What do you mean? - Count! She's a Munich bourgeoise. Shh! Her knight will beat you up! - A virgin. - The Maid of Orleans. - Joan of Arc. - A raving beauty. Guess what colour her hair is. On her head? Be serious in the face of such beauty. Some speed! The boat of Professor Upstart. No better fortune hunters than Poles! He's off with Miss Rylski to the Isle of Pines! - The careerist marquis. - Niepołomski's no rascal. He recovered from the Rome scandal and lives normally. - Look, our beauty. - The first there gets her. What a mishap, madam! I'll call a doctor. - No need. - You speak Polish? Then you understood everything. I apologise. I wasn't listening. Good for you. Are you in pain? - No. I'm fine. - Good! - Can you row? - Yes. Let's take a boat. How nice to hear such lips speak Polish! Get on with your rowing. Those two who ventured out are newly married? Niepołomski and Miss Rylski? Yes. - Been to their wedding? - Yes. You study here, in Berlin? Anthropology. Stanisław Lilicki. No woman ever had such lovely eyes. You lied to me. Niepołomski has another wife. You know him? For money you can get more than one divorce. I swear I've been to their wedding. I want proof in writing to show it to somebody. No problem. I'll bring you a copy of their marriage contract. - Today, if you wish. - All right. Astoria Hotel. My name is Ewa Pobratyńska. Not Niepołomski? - Certainly not. - You'll have it today. Give it to me! Now see for yourself. Sorry. Hello. - You're alone? - As you see. - Still living in Paris? - I may go home soon. - And I to Vienna. - Forgive my asking... - Have you seen Niepołomski? - No. - Not yet? Strange. - It is indeed. A Mr. Horst visited me in Paris. An industrialist who went bankrupt. - I never cared for him. - What did he say? He talked a lot about you. Claimed to be an old friend of yours. And said that Niepołomski had been to Warsaw. - When? - Soon after we left. Horst saw him at your parents'. And told him we'd left together. - You understand? - I do. Niepołomski raved and went for him. The next day he left and no one knows his whereabouts. I see? No one. I'm sorry I told you this. You did me a great favour. Helped fathom the unfathomable. Now I know he's an honest man. He always was, is and will be. You have a compartment for ladies? Please follow me. Three are already sleeping there. - What's the name of this town? - Schüttenbach. I'll give you a nice room with bathroom. Not a word. Where's your money? - Is that all? - Yes. Make a sound and I'll kill you. Will you? - Yes! - Stop screaming! Lie still! And wait. Or do you want me to rape you? At last! I've waited for years. In Europe, America, at sea... I always thought of you. We'll make love, darling! If you scream, I'll tell what you did with Łukasz's gift. Who are you? Never mind that. I'm your master. Your husband, if anyone asks. - We'll go away together. - Yes. Look at me. Not bad, eh? Why torture yourself? Let's have fun and be off. The likes of us need no babies. We're meant to wander. To roam the world. Here's to you! Good evening. Count Płaza-Spławski? My wife. We fought together. In Transvaal. Thank you, I don't drink. - A cigar, captain? - I don't smoke, doctor. Shame. He prefers thinking to drinking. Creates value out of thin air! I'd tell you any secret, there's no treachery in your eyes. Reading the cry-baby stuff again? Leave it for a graphologist. We're going to Płaza-Spławski's. Why me? - None of your moods! - I won't go to that den. - It's business, so no whims please. - Let him come here. He too has whims. He's a count! With a coat of arms, but no coat to put on. Damn his bloody face! He won't stoop to coming to mine. But if you went to his, he'd be tickled pink. Will you be there while we talk? I may step out for a while... - You double-dealer! - To get some paper or ink. I don't know what he's up to. He hates women, if that's what you fear. I know his Asiatic tastes. He's strange. Well? Come on! Relax. I'm broke while Szczerbic is rolling in money. I said she'd be difficult. Be co-operative. I read his letters to you. He'll do anything for you. Say one word and he'll sell his estate to follow you to America. What am I to do with him? You have a plan, I imagine. Ask him to come to Vienna. Tell him to sell his property. Or take a loan against it. Write a passionate, tender letter. What if I refuse? I'll say that you killed your baby. - You have no evidence. - That's what you think. Don't be so coarse with a lady. Why not have some fun with the count? You're not in love with him, are you? - If you detest the count... - I do indeed. But he loves you. They say it's nice to be admired by those we hate. Maybe he loves me, but what of it? Do your friends a favour: let him admire you upstairs. He'll pay a million for that. We Polish nobles are lavish. A fortune for your swan-like neck and white shoulders. But if he resorts to violence, just plunge the syringe into his face or arm, and press the piston. It'll contain an anaesthetic. What kind? Any. What's the difference? On your sign we'll show up and save you from the brute. No! - I won't do it! - Shh! People might hear you. We'll read it and post it. Read my letter? It's business, not romance. Will you write it? You filth! Write! Darling... Exclamation mark. I'm in Vienna... Stop. How beautiful the world would be... Comma. If I could see you now. Stop. To walk together the streets of Vienna... To walk together the streets of Vienna when the moon is shining. Yesterday I went on a group outing. I kept my distance fantasising that I was walking with you alone. In perfect silence I felt that we were together. Your estate may be lovely but I don't belong there, do I? Am I going to see you again? Why don't you come to Vienna while I'm here? I kiss your sweet lips like these flowers which I press to my mouth, my eyes. I love your soul and your sad eyes. Darling, come quickly! I love you so much! I miss you! Write to me Poste Restante. Tell me if you're coming now. My shining, dearest, beloved! I'm yours, Ewa. P. S. A sudden idea: if you sold everything and took a big loan we could go away forever and begin a new life. Maybe in America ? Do come quickly. I'm waiting. No. Tell me. He's an industrialist, mine owner. I'm to go with him to America. What about me? Should I go back to Warsaw? What would you like? I'll do anything you say. You're a weakling. Do you love your fiancé? I wish I could understand you. You're killing me. I will always love you. - Only you understand me. - Evie, sweetheart! - Do you still love Niepołomski? - No. I don't. Go now. I'll let you know when you can come. To stay all night, undressed. Evie! Evie? If you do everything right we can bring you your man. - My man? - Niepołomski. He has money to burn. - Is the door shut? - Yes. - He won't come back? - Never. I don't want you to see him again. I love you madly. Me too. It kills me to think of that man coming here. It leaves a deep scar on my brain. - You're crying? - Because... I'm so happy. First we'll go to Italy. Then on to America! You wounded Łukasz, right? It was you, wasn't it? Count Zygmunt Szczerbic of Zgliszcze. Show me the spot you aimed at. I'll kiss it. Here, at this side. Curare's unfailing. Paralyses speech. Also the vague and movements. It's untraceable. No blood. Just an accident. Calm down. He'll go in a minute. Wait until he's gone! Get out! Out! What's your name? Anna Winter. Is that your real name? What do you want my real name for? I'd like to talk to you. You as a human, not a streetwalker. - Benefactor! - Don't feel offended. If you came just to talk, then I'm busy. I'm going out. - How much do you charge? - 25 rubles. - You're expensive, Nymph Calypso. - For a visit. Here, child, and shut up. Sex or talk - you shouldn't care. - It's not the same. - I only want to talk. Take your money and get lost. No sex, no deal! Fine. Strip if you insist. Shifting ground? Some lover! Undress. Come on. - Will you tell me your name? - Ewa. - Your last name? - No. - Right. Leave your father out of it. - What's your name? Cyprian Bodzanta. Lovely hair, eyes, lips... You do your hair like a Roman empress. I do it like Cléo de Mérode. A vulgar person to imitate. She dances hideously. - Are your parents alive? - No. - Been long in this trade? - Long. - Can you read? - What a bore! I speak French, Mr. Reformer. I've been to Paris and Nice. - I led some counts by the nose. - I didn't misjudge you, trust me. Want a clerical job? Full board and pay. - Where? - In the countryside. - At your place? - Yes. I live there. A job? I know, I've been there. I never touch a woman I don't love. And I don't love you. Understand? Long live utopia! Cut out the irony. In Poland progress has always been a utopia. Co-operative farms are more real. I ask nobody to give away their riches. Aren't you afraid the girls might ruin your pictures? A work of art doesn't belong in private collections or museums. It should travel around the world carrying a message. We display ours at market stalls. - Did it hurt to give a fortune away? - Yes, but generosity wins the universe. And I want to win the universe. Debauchery seems a surer way to virtue than ignorance. Bodzanta had to drag me here. Today I'm the happiest woman alive. - You really like it here? - A lot. We can live here as we did before. But who misses men's tyranny? We're happier without men. - You all do what you like? - Yes. Work, rest, go out. - Do many leave? - Some do. A few got married. - You see men here? - We receive anyone we want to. But I don't think marriage is any good. A family's a filthy thing really. Did you have children? No. The pain of possession leads to the grace of loss. The grace of loss leads to the pain of possession. I'm bored with my virtues. That's my truth. I no longer possess anything. Except one secret. I wish to be graced with losing it. Tell me. I've been waiting. I killed my baby. Did you know Count Szczerbic? Yes. I killed him in Vienna. You... killed him. Let's lift our hearts to the sun. Let its light resurrect our spirit. Who's this one? - Excuse me! - Baldy! Łukasz Niepołomski sent me. - He gave me a letter for you. - A letter from Łukasz? You're always with me. I need you. I can't go on living like this. For the sake of your love we'll overlook your arson. Will you let me take you to him? - You know where he is? - Of course! - He wants to see me? - He sent me. - Łukasz Niepołomski? - Yes. Płaza-Spławski, of all people! How are you? You here? Want to do penance? Not yet. - Given to pleasure to kill boredom? - You're more bored than me. What about your American mines? Doing fine. Come to America. We'll have fun. I won't. I know your kind of fun. What's yours? Picking up human refuse? So it is. You're like an Arab colt willing to be a jade. So you fettered your legs and try to jump like that. A good joke, but empty. I thought your victims did you in. It's not so easy. You must be well armed to kill a tiger. You poor fool! You believe in mandrake as a remedy for grandpas to beget babies with young, vigorous and lusty females. Come, Ewa. - Is she going with you? - Yes. She's tired of your moral tales. My name is Stanisław Kozielski. I'm a sick man. Take care of me, as befits a spouse. I must be off. Where's Łukasz? On the Isle of Celebes. He's due back shortly. I'm on my way to meet him. Go if you don't like it. Back to the countryside. But I wouldn't do that. You might miss Łukasz again. Introduce yourselves, fellows. Batasiński. Grzywacz. Come on, the lady's waiting. Fajtaś. Come with me, Evie. I live nearby. Leave me alone, you scum. I'll give you tea with brandy. I'm your friend. Remember me? - Come. - No! You stink like a corpse. Not for money, but out of platonic love. I'm broke at the moment. - I've always loved you. - You pathetic clown! - I wanted to marry you. - You were the first filth I ever saw. I hate your dirty language. I was sleeping around even then, but you were too stupid to get me. You're lying. I made Mother ill and Father a drunk. You're lying. You were pure then. To hell with you! I thought you invited me. I can't bear the sight of you. And I'm penniless. I'll come if you show me where my father drinks. I will. I promise. We'll go to Marszałkowska St. Number 305. Make yourself beautiful. We'll go separately. You first. Here's something for you. The famous case of the late Cyprian Bodzanta. The insane count, came to its close. Yesterday the court annulled all his donations and reforms as effected in a state of insanity. His land was restored to his widow. Enough! Let bygones be bygones. Stop crying, you'll look messy. Leave it and get me my coat. You'll go first. Through the main entrance. Up the carpeted marble stairs. You'll see a door with the name Łukasz Niepołomski on a brass plate. Precisely. - The same. - What's he doing there? It's his home and office. I see! He'll see you. He's at lunch now. And we'll do the safe. - Will the four of you manage? - Yes, my sweet. You're going to kill him too? Not necessarily. But no tricks, or it's curtains! Łukasz! Run! They'll kill you! You have a woman here. She's innocent. She only came to warn me. Release her. I'll go bail for her with my whole fortune. THE END
