Trick or treat. I've been married 50 years, Oh. Marcus! I didn't expect you, buddy. Thought you had Tuesdays off. Yeah. Overtime. Trying to get as much as I can. I hear you on that. It's nasty out there. You're telling me. You know, I have to get a new belt. You know, I was 60 pounds lighter when I started this job. Were you two feet shorter as well? It all went to my waist and hips. Hey, good luck. It's Taco Tuesday, you know. All done? For the night, at least. Well, see you tomorrow, Gus. Take care. Looks pretty bad out there. Thanks, man. You bet. - The usual? - Please. - Here you go. - Thank you. You're welcome. How you holding up? What kind of question is that? Just seeing how you're doing is all. The same as any other night, but that'll change. You... planning something again? Again? Well, we have talked about this before. That was fast. Yeah? Who's timing me? Another one? You sure? Now, who are you to ask me that? If I remember correctly, you're the one who started me drinking. Can I get you anything else? - I guess not. - You got it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oi! You know what day it is, right? How can I not? You told me what day today was yesterday. And the day before that, and every damn day prior to that for weeks now. I need something from you by tomorrow, Marcus. If not, I have to get you out of here. Antonio. What do you want? Oh. Hey, kid. Hey, Marcus. It's kind of late. What have you got there? Not bad. Why a shuttle? Well, I used to have one just like it. Until Tommy broke it. Oh, yeah, that pain in the ass from school, right? I'd forgotten about him. Let me see that. Turn around. So, you are missing some important things. The details. That's what separates the doodlers from the true artists. There. Why don't you work on that for me, okay? Cool! Hey, man. You going to work? So, what's with the scruff? I mean, I think it's pretty cool. Well, it's not going to be really cool until it's fully grown in. And that's not going to happen until your late twenties. I should be hearing back soon, you know. About what? Come on. Don't act like you forgot. All the schools I applied to? Oh, yeah. Gonna get out of town, are you? Make something of yourself. I've worked really hard, Marcus. Listen. It's not going to be what you're expecting. And you should shave that. Come in. Oh, Marcus. Did something happen last night? No, I can't. Not again. Come on, man. I need it. I mean, of course you do. Is there anything at all that can be done? Anything you can let me have? - Like, now? - No, not right now. Oh. When can you? Let's see. About next Friday? Come on. That's my regular payday. Exactly. Oh, and Marcus. Lemon-lime wipes when you hit those countertops. Lemon-lime. I get one more complaint about the smell over there... Look who it is. I need some cash, man. Anything for work? Anything at all? Look around, man. It's raining. Nothing going on. No one comes down in weather like this. Thanks anyway. Wake up, Henry. You done already? No, I'm not feeling well. Called it in. They're going to send somebody else over to finish up. You know, you're probably coming down with something with all this rain. Yeah, probably. Can I ask you something, man? Sure. Are you the one that's always complaining about the scent in the bathrooms? They're not giving you any grief over that, are they? I mean, look, Marcus, I'm not trying to get you in trouble or nothing. You know, I just can't stand the smell of that flowery stuff. I can promise you, man, the lemon-lime scent is not covering the odor you're leaving inside there. Fair enough. What's the film tonight? You're definitely not feeling well, are you? Why is that? This is the most you've talked to me in months. Tonight, I'm binge-watching A Star is Born. How do you binge-watch a movie? Well, I have four different variations. I watch all four in a row and then I compare them to each other. You seriously have too much time on your hands. Yeah. Probably so. I could use some aspirins, man. Do you happen to have any? Uh, yeah, I think I got some. How many? Um, three. Never figured you for a musical guy. Oh, I'm a cinephile. Doesn't matter what genre. You want some water? No, I'm good. Got some in the car. Thanks. You're welcome. What a night, huh? Hopefully it lets up soon, right? So. We're really doing it this time, huh? What choice do we have? You know what happened today? I made Employee of the Month. Yeah? Good for you. That's three times. What does that do for you, huh? What... what do you mean? I mean, it's... it's Employee of the Month. It's a big deal. I mean, like... I mean, what does that get you? I mean, I imagine your career is going to take off now. I mean, how could they possibly overlook you now that you've been Employee of the Month three times? Now, we should probably drink to that. So this is the answer? Hm? After we do this, am I going to be better off? Can't imagine it getting much worse. You really believe that. You really think that... that this is going to solve everything? Hey. So, we really doing this? Marcus, he's too young for this. He's just a kid. Excuse me. I'm about to graduate, and I just turned 18. So technically I'm not a kid anymore. And, uh, I just got my acceptance letter from Cornell. My girl is going to Ithaca College, which is really close, so we'll be able to stay... All right, that's enough. You think you got it all figured out back there, don't you? Going to your fancy college... University. With your little girlfriend... Actually, she's my fianc√©e. Boy... you cut me off one more time. One more time. 18 years old. Think that means something, don't you? Well, it don't mean shit. It just means that you're a dumb kid who knows nothing about life or what it has in store for you. Don't go around thinking that everything is great and life is going to be perfect. - I was just trying to... - Boy. What did I say about cutting me off, huh? - Marcus. - You see, that's your problem. You don't listen. You kids just don't seem to comprehend the severity of it all. You're going around making your big plans. You're going to Cornell. Oh, and you're going to get married. And all that big plan go to shit real fast. You won't even see it coming. Come on, Marcus. Marcus. Marcus! Did I miss something? Nothing at all. You know, I... I'm wondering why we haven't started on this yet. I mean, we doing this or what? Yes. Marcus, you can't be considering this. Yes. And it's no longer just a consideration. It's going to happen. And what makes you so sure? What makes me so sure? Look at him. Look at us. Who's in control of this car, hm? Who's panicked, worried that this may finally actually happen? He's been pushed towards the edge each and every time, a little closer, every single blow, every single defeat, day after day, being let down by everything and everyone that really mattered to him. Every job he has ever had. Getting that prestigious Employee of the Month award. Every semester, bringing it home to his neglectful parents, those overachieving grades. And that special girl. Oh yeah. Got her, too. Year after year wasted on her. Enough. That's enough! Worked hard to nurture that relationship, but that too was a waste. You know, Marcus, there'll never be another woman like her. You know what that means for you? Loneliness, heartbreak and failure. Yeah, failure. Like that which you were to your mother. The ultimate embarrassment of a son. Shut your mouth. Marcus, do not listen to him. Your dad, hell, the man couldn't even bring himself to make eye contact with you. Not even when he was closing his own eyes in death. Do you want to know why, Marcus? Marcus, don't listen to this. - Don't listen to this. - It's because you're pathetic. You're a waste of human flesh. You cannot pay your bills. You can't satisfy a woman, for God's sake. You can't even get a damn erection anymore, can you? When was the last time you spoke with someone, anyone, that was not inside your head? Just do us all a favor and just end it already. I mean, why do you want to continue this? Just do it, Marcus. Don't listen to this guy. Let's talk about this. - Do it. - It isn't that bad. It... it isn't that bad. Do it now, Marcus. Do it! No! no! Put the gun down, Marcus! Put it down! Do it! It's a girl. Baby girl, Gaby. Eighteen inches, eight pounds, three ounces. Does she look like her mother? To the tee. Marcus. When was the last time you saw Gaby? Do you know where she is? Do you know what life has done to her? Would she even know about this and if she did would she... Would she even care? Marcus, remember that father daughter dance? The one where she said she was afraid. What was she afraid of, Marcus? She was afraid of, um... She was afraid of something happening to me, something that would prevent us from ever seeing each other again. That was 20 years ago. Marcus. Check out Gaby's page. Hey, it's finally starting to let up. Well. Not today. Marcus. What are you doing? Gaby has already moved on. She's got her own family now. You showing up just like this is going to serve as an interruption. Marcus! Why don't you let me be, huh? You're the one that left her. And yet you've been on me ever since. Just a voice of reason, Marcus. The only one telling you exactly what you're feeling, what you should feel. Out of all of you... you're the one that upsets me the most. Well, that can't be right. Even more than that dumb ass kid? You just can't let me have a moment of joy or escape, can you? You see the notice on the door, right? Why don't you just do us all a favor and be quiet for a while? Yeah, well, that's never going to happen, Marcus. Not going to go away like that. I'm going to be around for a very, very long time. I told you, Marcus, I had to do something, you know? Oi, man, where are you going, bro? You delivering packages now por la Amazon? Marcus! Come back! Marcus! You ready for this? Just saying. It's a long drive, all right. Don't let your mind get the better of you. Yeah, okay, yeah. Ignore us. It's probably for the best. You can't ignore me. Well, you definitely should not ignore me. Can I? 'Cause I would really just love to. Marcus, you should just focus on Gaby. So what do you really think she's going to say when you get there, huh? You going to tell her what a disaster life has been? Oh, my God. How the past seven years has been nothing but loneliness and heartbreak and failure. Do we really have to hear your whole tirade over and over again? Remember Gaby's favorite toy? Why don't we stop and get one for the baby? Really? Now, how would you have me do that? How would you have me find that 20-year-old toy in today's world, huh? What are you doing, Marcus? Seriously? You think you're the right person to help this man? Hey, what are you doing, man? Get away from me. What's your name, man? Stay back, I'm serious, do not take another step towards me. - You know what? - What are you doing? I spent the last decade of my life in your shoes, looking for the highest, the best place from which to jump. - What is this? - I walked out of stores with pockets full of pills. You know, the kind you think will get the job done? I even tried the old toaster in the bathtub routine. Sir, I'm kind of in the middle of something here, if you don't mind. I have a child... A daughter... and a wife. I had it all. You know what? It didn't take much, though. Selfishness. I was being selfish and it cost me everything. I... I... I'm... I need to do this. So if you could just get the fuck away from me. I... I... I... I get it, I get it, I get it. Just give me a minute and I'll let you get back to it, okay? There's a feeling you get deep down inside. Inside, it's like a process. I know you know what I'm talking about. When that feeling got the better of me, my daughter was, like, 10 years old at the time. My wife, she thought I was the world. All the reasons why I should have left it well enough alone but I didn't. I should have kept it bottled up inside, I didn't. Now, you would think after all those years of being together, she would have been there for me. In sickness and in health, for better or for worse, 'til death tear us part. On my way to find my daughter now. She's pregnant, you know. Because I'm going to be a grandpa. Me, a grandpa. Imagine that. You know, I don't know how she's going to react when she sees me, though. It's been a long time. - A long time. - Are you done? I have no idea what I'm going to say when I see her. The only thing I was really good at, I'll tell you this, was being a father. But that was until I went in. Oh, what a mistake that was. So damn foolish and it cost me everything. But I'm on my way now to get some of it back. At least, I'm going to try. I'm going to try. Thanks for listening, man. I hope you go quickly, and without too much pain. Wow. It actually worked. Not today. Not today. Holy shit. Who's there? Uh, no one. Uh, I'll be right back. Marcus! How are you, man? How are you? I'm good, man. I mean, uh... a couple grays lately 'cause of the kids, but I can't complain. Wow. Hey. Look at her. Are they talking yet? Hey, it's been a while, my friend. There's a strange man at the door. - Oh, damn. Uh. Just... give... - What strange man? - Oh. - Oh. Look. Look, hon. Look who's here. It's Marcus. Of course, I know who he is. Do you think I'm going to forget him? - Hi. - What do you want? I... Becka, come on. We haven't seen him in, like... Not like, Matt. Seven years. Hey, there you are! Come on, I want to introduce you guys. Hi. My name is Jackson. Hi, Jackson. So we met when you were just a baby. You were just born, and I was the third person to hold you, after your mom and dad. What brings you back here, Marcus? And you, Bella. Last time I saw you, you were just learning how to walk. So, did you guys know that Gaby is pregnant? Of course we do. I'm surprised you do. I was hoping to see her. Marcus, you can't just come back around here like this. Okay, just... Excuse us, Marcus, just... - Okay? - Okay. Come on, guys. Let's go back inside. Hey, you want to come inside? Have you eaten? So, um, what was that all about? Ah... she's still a little bitter, man. Yeah, clearly. What did you say to her? Look, don't worry about that. Join us for dinner. I'm sure there's a lot to catch up on. Oh, sorry, man, I... I forget that's even there. How does she seem? What do you mean? She happy with him? You talking about Rich? Yeah. Rich. Well, he's just that. Rich. Babe, come on. Is that really necessary? Ugh. Come on, kids. Time for dinner. Come, Marcus, sit down. We can't eat until everybody's sitting. You know, I'm not going to hide things from you anymore. I couldn't care less about your feelings. Beer? Yeah. You sure that's a good idea? You know, with your "condition." - Condition? - Yeah. Condition? She did it again. "Condition! Condition!" - Did she do it to again? - Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Did I miss it? Okay, okay. Can we eat now? "Okay, okay. Can we eat now?" All right, settle down. Start eating. Babe, you can't blame them. You did the air quotes again. Uh, yeah. You were still at Parkman & Taylor's then, right? Yeah. What wasted years. - Oh! - Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight, sweetie. - Goodnight, Dad. - Night, bud. Do you know who Denzel is? Do you know who Denzel is? Of course, "King Kong ain't got nothing on me!" All right, all right. Just get to your room. Doesn't he remind you of Denzel, Dad? Would you... j... Go, go. I'm sorry. I'm sure that came off a little racist. No, no, no, not at all. I actually get that a lot. What blows my mind, though, is that a... a 7-year-old knows anything about Training Day. Oh, yeah, no, he loves going through my DVDs and sneaking off films here and there. I'm just glad he didn't put the "shit" part in. Yeah. He's pretty good. Animated, too. You're blessed, man. You've got amazing kids. Ah, so where are you staying tonight? Yeah, that'll be at the old Dodge Estates. Um, down the block at the supermarket parking lot. What? No, man. No, you're staying in the... In the office tonight. There's still a bed in there. No, no, no, I... I don't want to intrude any further. Oh, stop it. Stop what? Uh, no, I was just offering Marcus the office for the night. He just... he doesn't have any place to stay, so. Why don't you call the Budget Inn? They probably have hourly rates. A clear sign I've overstayed my welcome. No, stop. Stop! It's just for a night. All right? All he's trying to do is see Gaby. - What's the big deal? - If Sheila finds out, you know the trouble that's going to cause me? How often do you speak to her? Often. Not as much as before, now that she's always on the move with her new family and everything. But considering, a few times a month. You know, Marcus, Sheila and I have been friends since I was a kid. We've always protected each other. She was the one to stand up and walk me down the aisle when my dad was a no show at our wedding. There's no way you or you are going to convince me to stand against her here. When was the last time you spoke with Gaby? Just last week. And she's fine, no thanks to you. When's the last time Sheila spoke with Gaby? I don't know. Well, I'm willing to guess that it's before my last conversation with her. Look, I'm not saying that what Sheila did to Gaby was okay. Us, Becka. Us. What she did to us. Now, I understand that she's your friend. And you have this overwhelming desire to defend her. But at some point, you have to realize that what she did was indefensible. Okay, guys. This is going to get out of hand. So can we please... Like, let's just call it a night. Okay. Well, thank you both for the dinner. And for the distraction. What? The distraction. It's the thing I look for every damn minute of every day. It's what stops my mind from wandering into places I hate being. You know what the downfall of my relationship with Sheila was? The thing that singlehandedly destroyed my life, ruined everything. She looked at me like I was a head case. All I wanted was some medication to help me... deal with the anxiety. Get some sleep. Why didn't you just go see a shrink? It was almost midnight. Not many of them available then. All I tried to do is to get myself some help. The doctor felt I was a danger to myself and had me Baker Acted. At first she was... upset, mostly because I didn't tell her. I didn't tell her because I was mostly embarrassed. Embarrassed. Of what? I don't know what was wrong with me. There I was with the perfect relationship, an amazing job and a phenomenal daughter. And then I learned that my insurance did not cover mental health conditions. Have any idea what it costs for a four day stay in a mental health hospital, especially after you factor in the daily meds and blood work? It's an insane amount of money. It's not something you just pay, even if you have a great job. For months, I fought with the insurance company in my job over this. At the end of which, they saw the need to let me go. What followed were collection, bills, bankruptcy. The loss of our home. And our vehicles. And then her. She'd had enough. So she left. All because I tried to get some help. Ever wonder why more people don't seek help, why so many people just end it? It's because it's harder than calling the 800 number. It takes a hell of a lot more than that. I determined that I would never try to get help again. I find distractions to be... More helpful. And the last few hours here with your family has been a wonderful distraction for which I am most grateful. I know this may sound selfish... but it's not meant that way. Finding Gaby. And doing everything that I can to help her... would be the ultimate distraction. Marcus, just take the office. I got to tell you, if you hurt that girl again, I'm going to make your battle a little bit easier. Thank you. Thank you both. Why didn't you come to me, man? I really didn't know any of that. I just knew you were going through some stuff. Seriously, if you ever get to that point again... please call me. Thank you, my friend. I appreciate it. I know, I know. What would you have me do? I barely got here. I only got, like, about $10 to my name. Thinking about selling the truck. I don't know. The bus. Maybe I'd pick up a bike. Of course I do! You don't forget that sort of stuff. Wait a minute. Hey, man. Hi, do you have imaginary friends, too? So you heard all that, huh? Yeah, well, I suppose I do. You have voices talking to you, too? Sometimes, they get me in trouble a lot. Really? How so? Well, they told me to come out here and find out who you're talking to. They did, did they? I know how to ride a bike. Want me to teach you? Yeah, well, thanks, buddy, but I don't think I'll need to ride one just yet. I have some money you can borrow. You have been listening for a while, huh? Well, the walls are pretty thin, but I do. I have $10 just like you. Well, listen, buddy, thanks a lot, but you go ahead and hold on to that, all right? But I'll tell you this: That's the nicest thing that anyone has tried to do for me in a... a very long time. It just seemed like you're having a problem. Well, I am. I am. The kind of problem I'm having, though, is not the kind that money can fix. Having good people like you and your family around, that helps an awful lot. Well, we're here for you, but not right now, because I'm going to get "busted." You went yesterday! You went yesterday! - No, you did! - All right, quiet down. Jackson's going to go first. Aw, that's not fair! Do the shoe. Do the hike. Do the dab. Do the worm. Do the... take the I. Oh, man. Hey, there he is! Did the kids wake you? You know how long it's been since I've been awakened by the voices of kids screaming and yelling? I'm sorry, man. I kept telling them to quiet down! No, no, no. It's been quite refreshing. It's actually something I've really missed. Where's Becka? Oh, she's working today. Here... why don't you get some coffee? There's mugs on the rack there. - Thanks, man. Appreciate it. - Ride the donkey. I have not slept that much in ages. Really? You only got, like, five or six hours. Yeah, well, it's usually two, three tops. Whoa, black, huh? There is cream and sugar, you know. What, do you think I'm one of those guys who would violate his coffee like that? No, not anymore. So what are they doing back there? I believe that specific move is the shoe. - Hmm. - I don't know. What's that one called, Jax? This one's called the hike. What's a shoe? That's not what it's called. Sorry that I'm not up to speed on the latest moves. See, to me, this was the best. What? The best part of my life. Watching my little girl being a little girl. Worry-free. Totally oblivious to the negativity of the world. Look, man, I don't want to cross any lines or make you feel any worse, but don't you think you were a major part of Gaby's introduction to that negativity? I need to find her, Matt. Any chance you know where I should be looking? Oh. Come on, man, Becka will... will not know that I found out through you. All right. - You know, she still plays. - Really? Yeah. Are you surprised? She's quite good. Yeah, I know. Yeah, well, she may be playing a few sets up at the T-Bird Lounge every Tuesday night. But you did not hear that from me. Got my word. - Didn't hear what? - Jackson! What did I tell you about listening to people's conversations? He sure seems to have a knack for doing that. I'm s... ugh. You better not tell Mommy about any of this! You hear me? Be with you in a minute. Thank you, guys, so much. We wrote that a few months ago. As you know, I've been going through a lot. Uh, I decided to cover this next song because of it all. We even recorded it. If you guys want to support us we have CDs and shirts in the back. How much are they, CDs? $10. Thank you. Have a good night. Okay. Coming! Well, I wasn't expecting a warm welcome, but... I wasn't expecting anything quite that bad either. No, the baby just kicked me so damn hard. Almost as if she sensed the presence of something completely evil. Evil? Wow. So it's a "she." Yeah, "she" is all you'll ever know about her. How'd you find me? I saw your performance last night. And you followed me home? Seriously? Yes, seriously, Gaby. I came here to see you. Then why didn't you? Last night at the lounge. Instead of hiding like you always do? "Hiding"? Okay, I'm sorry. - I just... - No. You have no idea what I've been dealing with over the years. Why are you here? Why now? Is it because I'm pregnant? How'd you find out anyway? Social media. - Oh, so you're stalking me now? - Stop. Gaby, it's not considered stalking when it's your own daughter. It's more like I'm... checking up on you. Well, I don't need you checking up on me. Gaby, Gaby. Wait. Why? What do you need? Money? A place to stay? Are you dying? Perhaps a bit of all of that. Dad, are you dying? Well, technically not now. Asshole. Yeah. Well done. I don't care! Whatever it is, I don't care! Hey. Yeah, he's here. Sitting outside on my lawn. No, why would I let him in? He can sit outside all night for all I care. Did you tell him how to find me? Do you always have to be like that? Say "I told you so" one more time. One more time. I know. I would have been there already, that's not the point. And I'll be here. Tomorrow night. The night after that. And the night after that. I don't care. - How we doing? - All right. Can you stand for me? - You okay? - I'm fine. Sir, can you keep your hands out of your pockets for me? - Excuse me! - Thank you. You feeling okay? - Sorry, officer. He's okay. - Worn down, but, um, fine. And you are? - I live here, this is my house. - Okay. Are you aware this gentleman has been out here - for almost two days? - Yeah, I know. He's my father. He's fine. Your father? What's he doing out here? Got a call about a strange man, possibly homeless, camping out here. Wait a minute, I might be homeless, - but I'm certainly not... - Dad. Well, it might be a bit strange to... He just popped up over here and I didn't want to let him in. Okay, so he's here without your permission. Would you like me to escort him off the premises? No, no, no. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I speak with you for a moment? Yup. Now's the time to tell me if this man is a threat to you or your baby. He's not. I just haven't seen him in a really long time and we didn't really end off on good terms. You know what I mean? I was kind of surprised that he popped up here out of nowhere. Man, he looks like shit. Actually, looks better than the last time I saw him. All right, well, get him off the street. And please don't put yourself at risk. If you feel like he's a danger to you, you give us a call immediately. No, he's no danger. Usually he's in danger. Right, you have yourself a good night, ma'am. - Thanks. - Have a good night, sir. So can I, um... Can I come in now? I don't care. I told you it would work. Yeah. But whose idea was it to call the cops? That was six months ago. - Gaby, I didn't know. - How would you? You haven't called me in seven years. Last I heard, you were in Ma it land or Sanford, or something. You know I didn't... leave because of you, right? Right. You left 'cause of you. Or mom, or money, or your friends or lack thereof, or whatever. But you left, Dad. You left at a time when a girl needs her father the most. You left me. I'm sorry, Gaby. I know it doesn't mean an awful lot to you right now, but I am. When your mother left... a feeling came over me. A feeling unlike anything I've ever experienced before. And you knew. You knew what I was going through. I was angry. It was angry at life, the world... anything, everything. I was overwhelmed. With voices in my head. Voices yelling, screaming. Trying to persuade me to do... horrible... unimaginable things. So I put myself in a place. A place where the only person I could harm would be me. And not my little girl. I was ashamed, Gaby. I was ashamed of who I was. I was ashamed... of what I'd become. So you left me alone. Two months after my... What do you think that does to a 19-year-old girl? Have I, uh, congratulated you yet? I would have, um, I would have brought something, a gift, but... Yeah, I got it. No worries. Is this your second? I saw... - I saw the pictures. - I lost it. Like I said, you have no idea what I've been through. I'm so damn stupid. I keep making these decisions, thinking I'm doing the right thing. I tell myself that the further away from you that I place myself, the better off you'll be. Once again, I screwed it all up. I'm sorry, that's bullshit. Excuse me? You made the decision to get help. You did something so many people are afraid to do, and it collapsed on top of you. Mom couldn't see it, but I could. Even as a teenager. I just wanted to help you fight through it. Gaby, you were just a child. Not a naive one, Dad. Losing the house was tough. Having no power for nights, it was tough. If it wasn't for Matt and Becka, I don't know how I would have made it those few months. And then I met James. So sorry you lost him. I wish I had known him. He was you. Exactly like you. Well, a later version, anyway. Negative in every way and always putting everyone before himself. He would protect me the way you would, and it kept me straight. Sounded like a great guy. Anyway, I got to go to bed. I have a doctor's appointment in the morning. Hey, could you... Could you, um, use some company? Come on. Came all this way and, um, I really have nothing else to do. Besides, you should have someone drive you. And her. I leave at nine. Okay. Okay. Thanks, baby. 'Night, Dad. Good night. Well. Yeah. I did let her down. I know she does. I don't plan to. Good night. And how are we feeling today? Oh. Excuse me, I didn't realize that we had company. Hey, Dr. Foster. This is my father. I'm Marcus. - Nice to meet you. - A pleasure. This is an unexpected visit. You can say that again. He found out about the baby. So, then, can I speak freely or...? He's not really up to speed on anything. Up to speed on what? What do you want me to do here? I mean, at this point, it doesn't matter, it's whatever. Just... Probably best if you told him. T... tell me what? Uh, well, as far as the ultrasound goes... baby looks great. So what do you say that we schedule that C-section - for two weeks from tomorrow? - C... C-section? You're not doing this naturally? There are various reasons why we have to have a C-section. I'll... I'll fill you in on a few, okay? Sure, of course. Gaby, how's the 16th look for you? It's good. Great, sounds good. Why don't we let her get dressed and, uh, you can follow me. Sure. Naturally, something does have us concerned with Gaby's pregnancy. Naturally. Otherwise, you wouldn't have brought me in here. Gaby has a condition called placenta accreta. Are you familiar with it? No. No, I'm not. Well, in short form, it means that Gaby's placenta is too deeply attached into her uterine wall. Okay. And that's a concern for the baby? No. Our concern here is for Gaby. Of course. Excuse me? No, I'm sorry, um... So, what are we talking about here? Well, we're going to perform a C-section and just be prepared in case she hemorrhages. - Okay, and we do that how? - The hospital here, we have an excellent overhead trauma team - that will be... - A trauma team. Okay. All right. So, um, can she... Look, this... is a very serious condition. How did this happen? It usually occurs in older women. Women who have had multiple C-sections. But in Gaby's case, there's just no explanation. So you don't know. Other than the cases that I just mentioned, no reason. Besides this C-section, we're also going to be performing a hysterectomy on Gaby. All right. So what are we talking about, chance wise? Since I've been here at the hospital, we've lost six mothers to this. Six? Wow. But that's why we have to take precaution and be prepared. And Gaby has done everything to prepare for this. She's even chosen - her adoptive parents, so... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What has she done? I think it's best that Gaby talk to you about this personally, okay? Yeah. I filled your father in, but I know he has more concerns. I think it's best if you take it from here? Thank you, Doctor. You're welcome. Hey. Come here. Gaby, what the heck? I don't know. I mean, it is what it is. How can you say that? I've had months to digest this, Dad. I know you just came back, but it is what it is. I mean, am I over thinking this? Doctors have a tendency to make things appear to be more serious than they actually are. It's a chance. But I trust Dr. Foster and her team. That's all I can do right now, right? And you didn't think about an abortion? I told you last night that James is just like you, remember? The only time I felt a sense of happiness coming from him is when he found out that I was pregnant. So imagine what it was like when we lost it. Now imagine what it was like when he found out I was pregnant again. So getting rid of the only thing he was ever proud of, especially after he died, wasn't even a consideration. Okay. So what is this about... possible adoptive parents? - Oh, she told you about that? - Mmm-hm. It's just a precaution. I asked Matt and Becka if they'd adopt the child... ...if something happened. Okay. So you seriously asked them? What was I supposed to do? I have no one else. There is no one else. Am I supposed to go to a complete stranger? - And I am...? - A complete stranger! I'm sorry. Did I miss the date on the calendar where I was supposed to be prepared for you to make a timely appearance - back into my life? - All right. Do not get snooty with me, young lady. - Excuse me? - You heard me. You lost all privilege to speak to me like that. Listen. Even if you came back a year ago, Dad, how am I supposed to be able to trust you to be capable of taking care of my child? Hi. I can check you out at front. Sorry to rush you, we just need the room. No worries. Gotta use the restroom. - See you in the car. - Okay. Oh, God. Shut up! All of you! Oh, you think you know her so well? Why? 'Cause you were there the most? What do you even know? You were just a child then. Do not think for a minute that you have a say in what happens here. Oh, God. Hey. I'm the one in control there. So you stop trying to tell me what to do or how to be. That's not going to happen. She's already made up her mind. You don't think I want to be there? I would give anything in the world to be there for my little girl. I'm the one that should be dying. Not her. Not her! How can this be happening? I know. You're right. You're right. Okay, not now. Wha... why do you have to do this now? I'm surprised. It's been quite some time since we've all been on the same page. You're right. She does need us. All of us. Need a napkin? Another reason why I wouldn't feel confident leaving my child in your care. Got it. I gotta tell you, though... I think I need that child more than she would ever need me. Anyways. She'll be in your care. And I'm here for you. And to spoil the heck out of her. Spoken like a true grandpa. Never thought you'd see the day, huh? No, not really. So I went into your truck earlier. And did what? Wha... why would you do that? It's not important. But do you want to talk about that box? Why would you save something like that? Saving each note became proof that I was... still fighting. Trophy suicide notes, Dad? Sorry, that's pretty sick. Yeah. Ready for this? Yeah. Hey, wait! You kept that all this time? All I had left of you. Wanna toss the first note? Yeah. December 12th, 2013. August 11th, 2016. July 6th, 2014. December 25th, 2016. April 7th, 2015. Hey! Take a seat wherever you want. Look at it. So, what are you having? Wait, I haven't looked at the menu yet. Right. Like you actually need to look at the menu of this place. Yeah, James and I used to come here a lot. Oh... Gaby. Well, aren't you about to pop! Let me guess. It's a boy, right? It is. Okay, so I'm assuming you want chocolate chip pancakes, right? - Of course. - And for you? - I'll have the same. - Okay. So two waters and a coffee? - Just water for me, thanks. - Coffee. Be right back. Why did you tell her it was a boy? Listen, she's been guessing boy for the past five months. Makes no sense to correct her now. So you and James came here a lot, huh? You do realize this is our place? I hate to break it to you, Dad, but I've been here with a lot of guys. - What? - Yep. Boyfriends, band mates, friends, Matt. Matt. Matt brought you here? Well, Matt and the kids. I'm sorry, Gaby, I... I just can't stand the thought of something happening tomorrow and me not being able to raise that child. Now, listen. A couple of nights ago, before I showed back up, I came really close to ending it. Go ahead and sell it, Dad. No, no, that's not... Not what I'm doing. I was at work, and I... reached out to your mom to let her know what I was about to do. You spoke to Mom? I sent her a text. And she replied. Mom replied? Really? - She did. - Well, what'd she say? What's that? That was her response. A thumbs up. One of those cartoonish-looking thingies. An emoji? She sent an emoji. She never believed I was serious. - What a bitch. - Hey. Don't use inappropriate language like that. Dad, seriously? The point is... I was sitting there with a gun in my mouth. You know what stopped me from pulling the trigger? Me? Something reminded me of the... the very first time I held you. That same something made me look you up, which was, then I actually discovered that you were... pregnant and I dropped everything and came looking for you. I'm here, Gaby. I'm alive. Because of you... and that baby. Mary. - What? - Her name is Mary. Like your grandmother. That's nice. Listen, I'll be fine. And you'll be here with both of us. And you can spoil her the way you want to. Uh, more than Becka? More than Becka. All right. Where are those damn pancakes? Wait. By the way, how are you paying for this? Yeah, um. Hey, about that... Can't sleep? - No chance. - Hungry? - It's too late for that. - Hm. But I have an idea. You ready for this? Wait a minute. Is that what I think it is? I cannot believe you still have this. Well, it is how I got started, you know. It sure is. Okay, it's almost time. In a few minutes, they'll be taking you to get ready, okay? Yes, ma'am. Oh, did you want him to join you? If he's allowed to. I think we can make that happen. Thank you. Hang tight. I'll get you ready to go. - All right? - Thank you. You look different without it. It's like I'm seeing my little girl again. Hey. It's okay. I just don't know what to say. Dad, you don't have to explain anything to me. Do you remember the last thing you said before you left seven years ago? No. You said "I'll be right back." - Did I really? - Yeah. And it took you seven years to come back. I am so sorry. Dad, my point is, is you came back. How in the world did you grow up to be so amazing? Well, you can thank Matt and Becka. Yeah, they really are good parents, aren't they? Yeah, they are. Listen, you've got to stop shaming this. It's the only way it'll ever get better. But before that can happen, you've got to stop being ashamed of yourself. Do you know how many people go through this? There's nothing embarrassing about it. Get that out of your head, okay? Are you ready? It's time. Hey. I'll be right back. - You good? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Warm enough? - I am, thank you. All right, we're going to get ready to wheel you in. - Okay. - All right. Marcus. The hell, man? I knew you took this. What did you do? What did you do? Nothing. Didn't want to be around it anymore. I didn't want to... some kid... to find it on the street somewhere. Do you know how much shit I took over this? I'm sorry, Gus. I'm sorry. Take care of yourself, man. Marcus. You okay? Hey, man. You okay? I'm sorry, Marcus. You're not the only one that can make mistakes. I'm human, too. Well, if we're going to do this... thank you. For apologizing? No. For stepping in for me... and being there for my little girl all those years. She was like a daughter to me. Just like you were there for my kids when they were born, I was there when she was born. I was there for all the big moments. Gonna miss that beautiful girl. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All changed and ready to go! Oh, my. Now, you know, she's got two older siblings that have been waiting around for her. We'll, come around. A lot. Right, little Miss Mary? - Right? - Yes. Yes. You'd better. Right? Wow, guys. That looks amazing. Now, you know, when I was your age, I used to do the exact same thing. Only in my case, it was my favorite toy. Now, what I want you guys to work on for me is... shading. Because that's what separates the doodlers... from the real artists. - There. - Cool! All right, guys. I will see you soon. You know who Morgan Freeman is? Do you? All right. Leave the impressions for the next visit. I just love 'em. Sorry. Yeah. Here we go. Hey. - Uh, thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you so much. You sure you got this? Don't make us come and take that baby away from you. Please call us if you need us. You're not alone, man. Clearly. Understood. Thank you guys. For everything. Hey. Hey. I got you, baby. I got you.
