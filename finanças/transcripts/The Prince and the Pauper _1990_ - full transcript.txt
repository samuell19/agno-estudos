For many years, England was ruled by a wise and good king. And the people flourished and were very happy. But by and by, the good king became ill and a darkness fell over the countryside. As the king grew weaker, his Captain of the Guard, a ruthless and greedy man, saw his chance to rob and terrorize the people of England. And worst of all, in the king's name. It seemed that no one could save the kingdom of England from the thieving captain and his ruthless henchmen. Until one day... Kindling! Kindling! Fresh kindling. Why, you can't cook dinner without a fire, can you, sir? Sir? Aw, I know, fella. I'm hungry, too. Snow cones! All kinds, sir. We got plain and rock and twig. Hiya, Goof. How's business? Gosh, Mickey, if I don't get a customer soon I'm gonna have to eat 'em myself. Aw, don't feel bad, guys. Come on, fellas. Secret handshake. Boola, boola, boola, boola! Bring it up! Why, one of these days we'll be eatin' just like the king! With lots of turkey and ham and potatoes and corn. Oh, yeah. And ice cream and cookies and pie. Fruit tarts and cobblers piled this high! Oh... * Give me a suckling pig To make my belly big * I'm just a little guy Give me a pizza pie * I'd have a happy face Next to the fireplace * I'd like a hat to wear * And thermal underwear * It would be appealing * To have that royal feeling * Doing everything * A little bit like a king * Like a king * Like a king * Just a little bit like a king * Just a little bit like * Just a little bit, little bit, little bit like * I would love to live just like a king * Captain Pete, Captain Pete, Captain Pete, Captain Pete. Captain Pete! * He never met a man he didn't cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat * He's the vilest villain that you'd ever want to meet Pluto, no! Pluto! * What a cad, super bad, our... * MICKEY: Pluto, no! No! No! Pluto! Pluto? Pluto. Who goes there and what do you want? Oh, gosh. I just wanna get my dog back. He ran in before I could catch him. Your Majesty? Do come in, sire. Oh, thanks. I didn't know it was you. Forgive me, sire. Phew! Oh! What do you think this is? Open house? But, Captain, that was the prince. Then who's that, numbskull? Now to review, sire. All triangles have three sides, and the relations between these sides are known as ratios. Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with... Sire? Huh? If you could give me your full attention? Name the three secondary trigonometric ratios. You may begin. Tangent. What the heck was that? Secant. Who did that? What is it, what is it? Yes, yes. Cosecant. Sire, we've been through this time and time again. It's hypotenuse. Hypotenuse! Now, Donald, I'll have you know that I don't find your behavior amusing at all. If the prince is to assume the royal duties that are... But he started it... - Donald! Ah, phooey. I'm always getting in trouble for that stupid prince. And as for you, Your Highness, you know that your father is ill and requires rest and quiet. Now, sire... Beat it, you dumb mutt. Get out of here. Captain! I say, Captain! Let go of my leg! What's the meaning of this uproar? Just some local riffraff, sire. Even the lowliest subjects of this kingdom deserve respect. Have him brought to me at once! Oh. The prince wishes to see you. Allow me! Oh! Hey, put me down! I'm a citizen. Wow. Hiya. * I'm just a little guy give me... * Oh, oh... What the devil's going on out here? Oh! Donald, if this is your idea of humor, I'm... You look just like... I thought you were... Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Just a moment. Now, who are you and who is your tailor? The name's Mickey. Mickey Mouse, Your Royal Highness. I mean, I... Ah, a beggar boy. Well, Mickey, I must thank you for saving my life. - Saving your life? - I was about to die of boredom when you interrupted my lesson. Do you know what it's like to be the prince? Oh, boy! It must be fun. - Never a moment to myself. Breakfast at 7:00. - Breakfast. Lessons till lunch. Fencing till teatime. Lunch. And every night, banquet after feast after banquet. Huh? Wow! And then, 9:00, bedtime. Beddy-bye. Oh, how I envy your freedom. Well, I... Games all day long, no studying dreary old books, staying up late as you like, eating junk food. Oh, if I could take your place for just one day... Yes! What a grand idea. Don't you see? It'll be perfect. I'll take your place with your friends in the streets of London. And you shall be the prince. The prince? I can't be the prince. Well, how do I act? What do I say? You needn't worry, lad. To govern, you need to say only one of two things. "That's a splendid idea, I'm glad I thought of it" and "Guards, seize him!" But your father, the king... I'll be back in the wink of an eye. And if there's any trouble, all men know me by this. Wow. I'm not sure this is a good idea. You'll do fine, Mickey. Why, you're looking more royal already. Goodbye, Mickey. Well, uh... You won't forget to come back now, will ya? Well, goodbye. Hello, Captain. Ah. My little peasant. Embarrass me in front of the prince, will ya? Peasant? Captain, I fooled you. I am the prince. Oh, forgive me, my royal liege. Well, how thoughtful of you, Captain. I live to serve. Oh! Sayonara, sucker! I did it. I did it! I'm free. I am good! I fooled him. Well, for now, nothing's going to spoil my fun. Hey, Mickey! There you are. Ah, my first encounter with the peasantry. Where'd you go, Mickey? Come here, you little nut! Mickey? Noogie, noogie, noogie. Come on. Give me that secret handshake, Mick. Go on, put your hand up here, come on, swing it down. Oh, yes. That is me. Mickey Mouse, peasant at large. My good man, you must forgive me. I am dreadful with names. Could I have your name? What's the matter with the one you got? I'm Goofy, remember? So I see. And my dear man, if there's anything I can do to help, by all means let me know. Oh, I get it. It's a joke! That's a great one, Mick. Will you look at the time? I really must be going. Ta-ta! Do you wanna play? Hey! Hey, come back here. Come back here. Come back! Gosh, if my friends could see me now! Surely His Highness has not forgotten his royal duties. Leave her alone! You're gonna get it for this! Leave her alone! Right now! Get away from her! Somebody help me! Relax lady, it's for the king. Yeah, the king. But it's all we have. Well, then, it's all we'll take. - Halt! As your royal prince, I command you to unhand that hen. What's so amusing? Oh, forgive me. I think you forgot your crown! When I return to the palace, you'll pay for this! I can't believe it. Stealing in the king's name. This happens all the time. Yeah. The king takes all our food. We're hungry. Out of the way, you slugs! Make way for the Royal Provisioner. Out of the way. Come on. Move it, move it. What are you, deaf? Halt! I am the prince! And I command you to surrender your entire inventory! And I'm the Queen Mother! Be off with you! Will this help? * Give me a suckling pig... Hmm. Now where can he be? For you, sir! There he is! Oh, thank you, sire. Gosh. Mick's flipped his wig. All right, all right. Clear out, out of the way. He's the one that showed me the ring, sir. You there. You're under arrest. Run for it, boy! Gosh. Hang on, Mick! I'm comin'! Whoa! Oh! Fell on top of you. Oh, that's rich! Fell on top of... It's great. Now, I may be losing my mind, Captain. And I know that you have said that time and time again. But all I know is he's acted like a nobleman. And he had the royal ring. The ring? So it was the prince I booted out. You threw out the prince? You're gonna get it. You're gonna get it. Nyahh, nyahh, nyahh, nyahh, nyahh, nyahh. Not if he doesn't come back alive! Ha! Take that! Ha! Take that! And that! Enter! Ooh! Nice shot, sire. Your Highness, your father is in his last hours and wishes to see you at once. Oh, well, we better tell the prince. He'd want to see him. You are the prince, sire. Oh, well, uh... I've been meaning to talk to you about that. Sire, he is gravely ill. I'll explain everything. The king'll understand. My son. Huh? Well, I'm not really the... - Come closer. My son. But... From the day you were born, I have tried to prepare you for this moment. I shall be gone soon and you will be king. You must promise. Promise me that you will rule the land from your heart, justly and wisely. I promise. I gotta find the prince. Good day, my phony prince. What the... Hey! Unhand me! Shut up! Now that our dearly departed king is out of my way, you're gonna do every little thing I say. 'Cause if you don't... But, Pluto! Get the picture? You there! What's happened? The king is dead, and the prince is to be crowned at once! Father... Your soup's almost ready, Mick. I mean, Your Majesty. Huh? Now it's up to me to right the wrongs I've seen. Children going hungry. Corruption everywhere. Gosh. You, you really are the prince, ain't ya? Sire, your wish is my command. Goofy, I owe you my life. And this will not be forgotten. Come, friend. We must return to the palace at once. Or a visit to the dungeon, my prince. Get him, boys! En garde! Let me go! Let me go, I say! How dare you! You'll pay for this, Captain! I command you to put me down right now! After the pauper's crowned, it will be adieu for you! Hey, get me outta here! I'm the prince's valet! Ah! Your Highness! Your Highness! We're saved! Wait a minute! You're in here, too! We're doomed! The coronation! My lord. This charade has gone on long enough! I demand you open this door immediately! Aw, shut up. Huh? Well, looks like the boss ain't wasting any time. Now I lay me down to sleep... Be my guest, pal. Hey, what's the big idea? Sorry. You wouldn't happen to have an ax I could borrow, would you? Thank you. I've had a lovely evening. Gosh. Goofy! Just sit tight, little buddy. I'll have you outta there in a jiffy! Be seated, sire. Oh. After you. No, no. Beauty before age, sire. Oh, no. Age before beauty. Your Highness, you're such a sport. Sit down! Got it. Now let me see here. Was it the skinny one or the round one or the fatty? Maybe it was this one. Sure I know I had it. Hey! Maybe it's this big one. Get 'em, boys! Whoa! Gosh! That thing's sharp! Whoa! Whoa! It is both my duty and pleasure to crown you... To crown you... To... I say, a rather wiry lad. To... So slippery. Would you hold still? Stop! What the... Look, I'm the prince, right? And whatever I order must be done, right? Uh, yes. Well, then, the captain is an insolent scoundrel! Guards, seize him! Seize him! He's an impostor. But I'm not, Captain. - Huh? Thank you, guardsman. Oh, boy! No, no, no. Wait a minute, Your Majesty. I can explain everything. Very well. I await your explanation. Your Majesty is too kind. Look out, sire! Geronimo! Hold on, sire! Oh, I got you now, ya varlet! Fooled again, Captain. Huh? Whoa! Whoa! Get out of the way! Oh, boy, am I glad to see... I mean... What a time I've... But you see, I... Which... Good heavens. Which one is which? Pluto! Oh, boy. I guess there's no fooling you, boy. Therefore, I crown you Prince of England. King. King. King. King of England. * Everybody sing a toast to the king * To the king * To the king * To His Majesty the king * To His Majesty Royal Majesty * To His Royal Majesty the king... * Long live the king, yeah Gosh. And so, with his loyal companions Mickey and Goofy at his side, the young king ruled his happy country as he'd sworn he would. With justice and compassion for all.
