The pep rally will take place at 2:35 this afternoon on the quad. Attendance is mandatory. Oh, sorry, kelly. Sorry, kelly. Billy. Look, i know. I know. Don't say it. You're late. I asked you not to say it. Look, i overslept. What can i say? Something new. Oh, well, see, there was this little old man that was crossing the street. Billy, forget it. I can pick up this mess. Just go to class. Are you sure? Are you sure? Yes, i'm positive. Thanks, kel. See you in class. Eddie hayward? Here. Uh, billy colton. Here. Mr. Colton. You are tardy now for the 8th time, which means you may be headed for a brief leave of absence. Oh, see, i wanted to be on time, mr. Willard. Really? Yeah. There was this emergency this morning, you know. Mmm-hmm? And, uh, it was early this morning. I was on my way to school, when suddenly, uh... yes, billy, what is it? My mother's hair dryer exploded. It almost killed her. Enough, mr. Colton. She has to go out and buy a wig now. Sit down! Unless you would like to go down to mr. Webber's office and entertain him with this-- mr. Willard? What, kelly? I'm sorry billy was late, but the copy machine was jammed. And he had to help me fix it. Really? Why don't you take your seat now? Yes, sir. Thank you. Miss fremont, hat. Sorry. How many times? I'm sorry. I have lost enough class time. Everything's so amusing to you, mr. Loomis. Now, if you'll recall, class, the last time we discussed how political opportunists in boston and--and in new england, new salem... what is this? What--what is... miss fremont, i sent... there is nothing here in order. Everything is out of sequence. You mind telling me why everything is... hmm? I'm sorry. Everybody is sorry. Mr. Willard? Nothing from you. Nothing from you. But, mr. Willard, it was my fault. What isn't your fault? I bumped into kelly in the hallway. Shut up. Now. Is it true you're thinkin' about asking kelly out? Yeah. Now, why don't i believe this? I don't know. It's the truth. You've known her forever. What's the big deal? Look, i don't know. I just looked at her and... excuse me? Are you brain dead or what? What are you saying? I'm saying that you and kelly are pals. You don't date your pals, butt sniff. It'd be like dating me. Uh, i don't think so, sam. No. You see, kelly's pretty. Hmm? Kelly's smart. Mmm-hmm? And kelly's a girl. Brilliant observation. * I'm not missing you * no hello. Hey, not so fast. Hold up. Bill, come here. Check this out. Oh, my god. I guess that's the new neighbor. Is this fair? I have a 93-year-old widow living next door to me. Well, come on over. I don't bite. Hi, uh, i'm sam loomis. I, uh, live around the corner. Need any help? I'm lisa grace. Who's your friend? Uh, i'm billy colton. I-i live next door. Oh, right, i think i met your mother this morning. In fact, i invited her over for drinks tonight. Why don't you join us? Uh... ok. Great. Then i'll see you later tonight, billy. Uh, yeah. Sure. Great. Then i'll see you later tonight, billy. Shut up, man. Later. I don't see why you have to do that. Hi, mom. I'm home. I'm in the kitchen. Hi, mom. Ok, if you need me to approve the designs, i can probably do it tonight. Right. But i gotta go. Billy's home. Ok. Bye-bye. How was work? Fine. How was school? Oh, it was great. Physics, german, algebra. All the things that have real meaning in my adult life. Uh-uh-uh. There's this great new invention. It's called the glass. Mr. Webber, your principal, called again. He said you're one late-slip away from suspension. Yeah, well, willard writes me up when i'm 5 seconds late. The guy just won't give me a break. He doesn't have to give you a break when you're late. Yeah. He's got a stick up his... uh, don't say it. You know what i mean. The guy's always giving people a hard time. You know what i think? I think you're asking for a hard time. And telling him all those stories doesn't help. My hair dryer exploded? Please. Hey, i tried. Try a little less. You know how to handle someone like him. Besides, you only have another 3 weeks. Mom, i'll graduate. Ok? You better, if you want to drive my car. Billy. Can you do me a favor? Yeah. Sure. I gotta work late tonight and i promised our new neighbor that i'd stop by after dinner for a drink. Could you just go over and give her my apologies and give her this goody basket? Uh, you want me to go over there and bring a goody basket? Tonight? Alone? Uh, no problem, mom. Billy, hi. Hi. Where's your mom? Uh, she couldn't make it. She had a last-minute, uh, meeting with a client. Oh, too bad. Come on in. Uh, welcome to the neighborhood. Thank you. Well, that's very sweet. Yeah. Sorry about the mess. At least the painters finished my bedroom. I could use some advice on the kitchen. Oh, you know, uh, if you need any help, my mom's an interior decorator. Oh, good. Then i'm glad she didn't show up. Me, too. While i've got you here, could you do me a big favor? Sure. Now, i can't live without my microwave. So if i hold the box, will you lift my oven? Uh, uh, uh, yeah, sure. It's heavy. Oh, i got it. Oh, great. Ok. Thank you. You're welcome. You look like a beer man to me. Really? Let's see. Cold beer on a hot summer's day ought to cool us off. Here you go. It's hot in here. I can't wait till they fix the air conditioning. You're blushing. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. I haven't seen a good blush in... well, since grade school. Thanks for helping me. Oh, uh, uh, i--i--i--i better get going. I--i got homework. It's just tony. He's early. Billy. Yeah? Can i ask you something? I don't know many people here. Well, if i need a friend, can i count on you? Sure. Yeah. I--i sleep right up in that bedroom right over there. If you ever need me day or night, just call out "billy."

Oh, god. What? What? Her long beautiful blonde hair is cascading across her white alabaster shoulders. Oh, cut the shit. No. I swear, sam. It's really true. Ok, ok, you've convinced me. I'm coming over. Uh, no, no. What do you mean, no? I'm your best friend. Uh, no, sam. You can't come over. What's the matter? You afraid i'll tell kelly? Uh... billy? Billy, what-what's going on there? Billy? Hello? Billy, alive or dead? Billy? Billy! Uh, what? What's wrong with you? Uh, uh, nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. I was just makin' it up. But i had you going for a while, didn't i? God. You dick-nose. You know, i don't know why i listen to your bullshit. Yeah. I know. I know. Billy? Want a date? Get in. It will cost you $100. Get in the back. You're gonna like me. No way, creep. Help! Help! Morning, mom. Morning. Just push this stuff out of the way. God, mom, don't you ever take a break? Have a little fun? Do you like living in this house, do you, huh? Yes. Yes. Ok. Well... oh, i almost forgot. Did you take the goody basket over to our neighbor? Oh, mom. Mom, listen to this. Mom, i should have told you. I--i went over there, right. And she opened the door and she looked in my eyes and then she started unbuttoning her blouse. Mom, mom, listen to this. Mom, she kissed me. Right on the lips. Yeah, listen. You're gonna be late for school. And i want you to get going, ok? Come, come on. Glass. Fabric mart? Yeah. Is louie there, please? Working hard? Shh. Sorry.

Oh. Lisa? Who's lisa? Lisa's just my new neighbor. I'll say. This is my asshole friend, sam. Charmed. * You're cool like the barrel of a gun * * i wait, anticipating * 5, 4, 3, 2 oh, my god. She must be a hooker. I don't believe it. Look, i'm tellin' you guys the truth. I've seen it 2 nights in a row now with my own eyes. A different guy each night. Yeah. She leaves her curtains open just so you can watch. I'm surprised she hasn't invited you over to her house. I mean, why not? She did. She what? She did. Oh, fantasies, billy. Uh-huh. Shut up, sam. I can't believe you, kelly. I can't believe you either, billy. Oh, oh, i see. Fine. Then why don't you two come over to my house tonight? You'll see. Only if you keep your hands to yourself. * I wanna take you, come on, come on * billy, i'm going out to dinner. Uh, let's not make it too--too late. Ok, kids? Ok. Bye. Good night. Good night. Shh. Shh. Shh. She's gone. Finally. All right. A telescope? Come on, you guys. I don't think we should be spying. Oh, come on, kelly. Admit it. You wanna see her just as much as i do. My mom gave this telescope to me when i was 12, to watch the stars. If she only knew. Hey, which is her bedroom? Ok, it's the 2nd floor. The one with the light on. See that? Yeah, yeah. Wait a minute. I see movement. Wait. Let me see. Let me see. All i see is a woman with mud on her face and flannel p.j.'s. Let me see. She looks ugly. Wait a second-- hold on. She's going to bed alone. Oh. Wait, guys. Guys, guys, wait a second. Wait a second. Guys, that can't be. Look, i've seen her with a different guy every night. There's always a pattern. Oh, there's a pattern, all right. A pattern of bullshit from billy colton. K-kelly. Look, billy, i have a lot of better things to do than hang around here and watch some woman with mud on her face. Come on, sam. Let's go. Ok. I'll call you tomorrow, ok? Sure. Oh, uh, uh, stargazer don't stay up too late, ok? Well, mr. Colton. On time today. What a pleasant surprise. Take your seats, class. We will have a short quiz as promised today. Please. Please. No groaning. It will be relatively painless. Now, mr. Colton, will you please pass out these test sheets to the rest of your classmates? Sure. If it's not too much trouble, please button the top 2 buttons. Please, please. How many times? Oh, a pen. How is everybody? Where's my... sam, no. Put it away, sam. I will now take roll. No, sam, no. Wait, mr. Willard. No! You're through here. So help me. You're terminated! Do you hear me? You're terminated! You'll pay for this. I tried to tell him i did it, but he wouldn't believe me. You know, you really are my asshole friend, sam. What do you mean? That stupid trick you pulled just got me suspended. God, look, i never thought they'd blame you. That's because you never think, period. Just stay away from me, all right? Billy? Look, kelly, it's not your fault. I just gotta get out of this place. Hi, lisa. Hi, billy. Don't you have homework? Uh, no. Temporarily out of homework. Oh, don't sound so sad. It's just a couple of days. You want me to wash your car? Oh, well, actually, i'm going to need it right away. Can i take a rain check? Tomorrow? Yeah. Sure. Great. Thanks. Anytime. Bye. Uh, you're welcome. Yes, of course. I recognize your voice. Oh, really? That sounds interesting. I think we can arrange to have some candles. All right. I'll see you tonight. Bye. Billy! Oh, that's not good. Now they'll know. No! Jesus christ! Jesus can't help you now. Son of a bitch. Operator, get me the police. So, what you got, dolan? Her name was lisa grace. And? 26 years old. Dead. From 2 precise stab wounds to the upper torso. Same m.o. looks like our man. Well, let's take a look. Ok. Forensics is up there now. The body hasn't been touched. Thanks, pete. Flash. Flash. Ah, shit. What a waste. Pro? Apparently. Landlord said she just arrived from seattle. Only lived here 3 days. No family i've been able to trace. Handcuffs. She never had a chance. What say? Good evening. Anyone else talk to him yet? His mom will be back soon. Billy colton? Yeah. Capt. Crane. Homicide. You want to tell me what happened? Yeah. I saw lisa get murdered. Listen, i was up on the roof and-- whoa. Whoa, whoa. Roof? What were you up on the roof for? You see, i was trying to prove to my friends that lisa was... um, listen, listen, it was too dark. Wait a minute, billy. I could see her. Did you know that lisa grace was a prostitute? Well, i had a good idea. You had a good idea? Hey! What the hell is... mom. Billy! Mom. God, mom. I'm so happy-- what happened? Mom, lisa, the woman next door, was murdered. Willard did it. I saw him. Mr. Willard? Who is this willard? Who are you? Capt. Crane. Homicide. Who's this willard? Look, he's my history teacher. And i saw him do it. I saw him kill lisa. How could it be mr. Willard? Mom, i saw it. I'm not making it up. I swear to god! He had this weird mask on and then he stabbed her. If he was wearing a mask, how'd you know it was willard? Look, i ripped the mask off him. We were struggling on the roof. But what were you doing on the roof? I was trying to prove to kelly and sam that she was a hooker. Hooker? In this neighborhood? Billy! Yes. Look, i thought i could get a picture. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got a picture. I got a picture just as he was trying to stab me. Wait a minute. Excuse me. This mr. Willard, he tried to kill you, too? Yes, he tried to kill me, too, with the same knife. Dolan, why don't you have this film processed and, uh, run a check on this, uh... uh, uh, willard. Zachary willard. Willard. Junior and senior high history at brenner high. Got it. Ok, i think that will be enough for right now. Uh, mrs. Colton, why don't you bring billy down to the station tomorrow and get a formal statement, ok? What do you mean tomorrow? What about tonight? Aren't you gonna arrest this guy? We investigate and then we arrest. You can't just let him go loose like this. He's a killer! Good night. Good night, captain. Honey, it's all right. It's ok. I'm here for you. What's--what's the meaning of this? Capt. Crane. Homicide. This is detective dolan. Detective? We'd like to ask you a few questions. Go right ahead. Do you know a woman by the name of lisa grace? Lisa who? Lisa grace. No, i do not. She was stabbed to death earlier this evening about, uh, 10:00. That's shocking. That's terrible. Where did this happen? We have an eyewitness that places you at the scene. Me? Are you serious? I've been home all night with my brother stanley. And who, may i ask, is this, uh, eyewitness? I'm not at liberty to divulge that at this time. Captain, you're an officer of the law. I happen to be a schoolteacher. And it happens to be relatively well-known that i am not exactly well-liked by some of my students. So perhaps it's one of my students playing a prank. Because i assure you, i have not left my home all evening. Are you a policeman, too? Yes, i am. Stanley, please. So can i see your gun? Stanley. Come on. Let me see your gun. Stanley. Please, please. Back. Back. Sit. You'll have to excuse my brother, stanley. He, uh, he has the mind of a 12-year-old. He means no harm. Well, thank you for your time. Shit. Probably have to ask you a few questions later. No problem with that. Anything to clear up this nonsense. We won't leave town. Stanley, please. A woman has been murdered. Good night. Good night. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. We ought to book them just for weirdness. Yeah. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Whoo. I want to run a detailed check on this guy willard. Ok. Meanwhile, i think we better go back and talk to the colton kid, all right? Fine. Let's go. Oh. Oh, what a long day, huh? Oh, yeah, why'd you have to tell those people that i got the mind of a 12-year-old? Oh, please. That's not nice. Why did you have to ask to see her gun? She was cute. But she's not your type, stanley. I'm scared, zachary. I'm scared. Why? You have nothing to worry about, stanley. No one. Absolutely no one is going to believe billy colton. How do you know that? I know. You do? Yeah. You know why? Because billy colton is a sniveling little liar. How come you asked those policemen in? Why not? I have nothing to hide, right? Nothing to hide, huh? Nothing to hide, zachary? What about that furniture? Furniture? Oh, the furniture, as you quaintly refer to it, is all neatly stacked, safe and sound, locked in the cellar. Go. Would you like to check on the furniture? Go and amuse yourself. Tell it a bed time story. Go. Ok. I'm goin'. Yoo-hoo, coming. My brother. So, how's the furniture doin' today? Look at this. I washed this for you. For you to wear tomorrow. Nice? Huh? What do you think? Nice? I washed this out, too. Crybaby. Panty. What is this? No answers, huh? No answers? Please. Oh, please help me. Help you? Help you? Stop whining like that. I hate that. Furniture shouldn't whine. Please. Why are you calling me that? Why am i calling you furniture? That's what you are, you know. People buy you. People open your drawers. People polish you. So... so, here. Well, willard had an alibi. He also said he thought that one of his students was playing a practical joke. I can't believe you didn't arrest him. I told you i saw him. I didn't say he didn't do it. We just don't have any proof. The man has an alibi. The lab's got zero. The roll of film wasn't even exposed. Right. Oh, shit. You know, there's been a series of murders. The callgirl killer. Making false statements in the course of a felony investigation is a crime. Just a minute. Captain, are you saying my--my son is-- he'll be ok. We'll make sure of that. We'll be in touch. Good night. Good night. Thanks. Hmm. All right, stanley. Playtime's over. Start my midnight snack now, please. Ok, zachary. You know that billy colton? Don't worry about billy colton. When the time is right, satan's disciple will take care of him. Praise satan. Praise satan. Now start my kidney pie, please. Honey, will you get the phone, please? Yeah. Hello. The police don't believe you, billy colton. Now. Mom. Come here. Now, satan will make claim to your soul. Mom, mom. Listen to this. Will you come here? It's just a dial tone. What? It's a dial tone. What do mean just a dial tone? Hi. Hi. I'm glad you came over. Are you all right? Yeah. What's that? Nothing. It's just memories. Everybody's talking about what happened. That's great. That's just great. Nobody believes a word i've said, kelly. I've told so many stories. It's like the boy who cried wolf. More like the boy who cried devil. Billy, are you sure it was mr. Willard? It's pretty hard to see-- of course i was sure. Look, he tried to kill me, kelly. Would i make something like that up? I didn't make up lisa's body, did i? But mr. Willard, the callgirl killer? I know. Look, he called me last night and threatened me over the phone. He threatened you? Yes, he threatened me. Did you tell the police that? Ok. What did he say? Some weird shit about satan claiming my soul. Look, kelly. Kelly, i'm not lying. God, why doesn't anybody believe me? Billy. Billy, i'm sorry. I want to believe you. I do. What am i gonna do, kelly? I don't know. I've got to go in and face willard in class on monday. We got to get somebody to help you. But who? Police have been trying to find this guy for nearly a year now. I tell them who it is, and they won't even arrest him. God, there's got to be someone. No. Wait a minute, kelly. Kelly, wait a minute. What? One of my dad's best friends used to be a cop. Uh... do you remember his name? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It started with a "d." Uh, french. Uh, god, he used to... i remember he used to come over and tell us these great stories about the crimes that he'd solved. Oh, i must have been 7 or 8 years old then. Billy, that was years ago. Haven't you seen this guy since then? No, no, no. But i'm sure he could help. Sure he could. I know. Oh, goddamn! What was his... devereaux. Kelly, it's devereaux. Ron devereaux. Come on. Wait. His number's got to be in here somewhere. Oh, sorry. That's all right. Ok, hold this. She kept all this stuff? Yeah. Kelly. Kelly, look at this. I almost forgot about this. Hold this. Billy, i told you i don't like guns. Billy, please. I sure could have used this last night. His address has gotta be in here somewhere. Here it is. Here it is. Oh, good. Uh, ok. Devereaux. I wonder if he's moved or died or something. 3214, speedway. Here. Yeah. Is that him? Yeah? Mr. Devereaux? So? I'm billy colton. No. Bobbie colton's billy colton? But you're a little boy. That was about 8 years ago, mr. Devereaux. 8 years? God, where have i been? Come in. Mr. Devereaux. Mr. Devereaux, this is my, uh, friend kelly. Hello, kelly. It's nice to meet you. Why don't you sit down? Thank you. So, uh, billy, you, uh, said you had something very important to tell me. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. See, last night, i was-- i was-- i was looking out my window, ok? And i saw these candles burning-- billy. You saw candles? Uh, mr. Devereaux, last night, i saw my history teacher murder my next-door neighbor. He--he stabbed her and then he tried to kill me. Now, the police, they don't believe a word i've said, so y-you were the only person i could think of to turn to. Excuse me. Uh... that's an interesting story, billy. History teacher, hmm? But you see, uh, billy, i'm, uh, i'm retired. I don't do this kind of work anymore. What did you want me to do? I need you to help me. You used to say you were the best crime-solver the department ever had. I did? Yes, you did. Well, that was a long time ago, billy. And i--i told you i-i'm retired. This--this work is a lot of stress and i-- listen. Listen. Listen. Could you just listen? Could you just hear my whole story, please? Ok, billy. Tell me. You're late. I don't go for this latin stuff. Uh-oh. Oh, mighty satan, father of evil, we call upon thee. We ask you to accept this offering that we have prepared and to help us raise up against our enemies and yours in this world and the next. Would you like this? Just a little? Have you learned how to behave, my dear? Really? Well, let's see. I guess not. I guess not. Satan awaits you, my dear. It's just a matter of time. What do you think about all this, kelly? What do you mean? Do you know this willard character? Yes. Do you believe he's a killer? I believe in billy. Of course you do. I wish there was something i could do to help you kids. Look, just forget it, ok? Forget it. Come on, kelly. He's not even gonna help us. Keep me informed. Yeah, sure. Thanks a lot, mr. Devereaux. Glad to see you. Oh, anytime. How you doing? See this? Hear what it's playing? You hear it? Here, listen. Gone. Here. Gonna put you back on the street again. My brother's gone too far. Yeah. Here. You don't believe me? Shh. We got to keep it down. Keep it down. Ok. Undo your little feetsies. You know what? Time to get back in business again. Get dressed. Ok. Ready? Don't make any noise, either. I won't look. Hey, hey, sorry. It's ok. Oh, god. Shoes. Oh, wait a minute. You know what? Please, god. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hey, i'll--i'll go first. Ok. Ok. Ok. Please, god. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait. Thank you. Thank you. It's my brother. I got the perfect place for you to hide. It's ok. Get a little rest. I swear. Just a little rest. You'll be all right. You will be. It's my room over here. That's andy panda. Come on. Here. Take your shoes. Nice in here. Where are you taking me? To a better place. Welcome to hell, my dear. Night-night. Now, let us proceed. The dead shall rise. I will give to the dead power over the living so that they will remember them. Hmm. To thee we offer this, the chalice of ecstasy. It's good. I summon thee and call thee forth from thy abode in darkness. I evoke thee from thy resting place in the bowels of the earth. Stanley. May the dead rise! Close the book. Oh, friend and companion of the knife who longs for blood and brings terror to mortals. Look favorably upon our sacrifice. Oh. Mom? Mom, is that you? Mom. Bobo. God. How many times, huh? How many times? Oh. Oh. You scared me. Mom. Excuse me a second. Yo, dolan. What? I think you better come in here. The expert from the commissioner's office has some very interesting theories. You got it. Hey, crane. Oh, theresa, not now. When are you gonna catch the killer? Look, we're workin' on it. All right? Well, that's not good enough. A working girl can't make a living anymore. Well, i'll tell you what. Uh, why don't you go to law school, you know? Get a job or get married or-- yeah. Stay at home. 17th victim. This guy is very clever, very lucky, or sick, or all the above. Or a believer in satanic rights of sacrifice. Dr. Lawrence, det. Dolan. Doctor. But why hookers? I thought that sacrificial victims had to be virgins. Doctor, you're the expert here. Why don't you tell us why? Well, the true believer thinks he's satan's representative on earth. The devil incarnate. By doing satan's work, he can assure himself of a chosen place in hell. Ok. So, tell us what kind of person we're looking for. Somebody who feels society's dealt him a dirty hand. Could be anyone. Homeless drifter, successful lawyer... a teacher? You have a suspect? Possibly. But he's totally clean. He doesn't even have a traffic ticket. They're dual natures. They're very clever. By day they recite the pledge of allegiance. By night they--they put up unholy altars and say prayers backwards. Well, this suspect uses handcuffs and, uh, symbols painted on the walls. You're just gonna have to be patient. Oh, yeah. Right. We'll tell that to the commissioner. Eventually, when the moon hits the right place, he'll prowl. He'll move, he'll try to kill. You be there first and you'll get your man. Uh, all right, class. Everybody put down their pencils. Test is over. Leave your answer sheets on your desks. It's over. Donald. Everybody go. Billy, not you. You stay a while. Thank you, everyone. Billy, pick up the test sheets for me and put them on my desk. Thank you, billy. Mr. Loomis, you have some mission here unknown to me? I thought not. You may go, mr. Loomis. You have a question for me, kelly? No. I was just waiting for billy. Well, i have one more small little chore for billy. Ok. Would you take this to mr. Webber's office? I see you missed 2 over there in the first row, billy. Sit down, billy, in my chair. Leave your bag. If you do anything to me... yes? The police are gonna put 2 and 2 together. You still don't understand, do you, billy? You have offended the lord satan and nothing, absolutely nothing, can protect you from his fury. You know how much trouble you've caused him? No, sir. You know what i should really do? I should cut your eyes out right now. That's what i should really do. Would you like that? No, sir. Billy, why don't you tell me what you saw that night? I saw... yes? Hmm. I saw-- i saw nothing. I lied. You lied? Yes. That's what i thought. That's what i thought all the time. That will be all, mr. Colton. Get out! I thought you wanted to go. Go! Billy? Billy, wait. What happened? Kelly, he's really crazy. He really believes this devil shit. I've gotta find something-- find something. The knife, the mask. I've gotta get some kind of evidence. But how? I don't know. I don't know. I'll start with his house. Spooky-looking place, isn't it? It is kind of weird. It's all closed up like he's hiding some horrible secret. Billy, let's get out of here. I have a feeling someone's watching us. No. It's just your imagination. Willard's at school. Kelly, look out! Run! Get back! Let's go! Run! Stay there. Billy. You see, i wasn't lying. Shh, it's ok. It's over with. Look. Look, capt. Crane, he tried to run us down. And it wasn't just me this time. Kelly was with me. We almost got killed. And what the hell were you doing there? We were trying to find some evidence. Look, can't you get a search warrant or something and go over there? Why don't you kids just borrow my badge and gun? You cut out the middleman. Look, capt. Crane-- you're not a credible witness. Besides which you have not one shred of evidence to implicate him. Aren't you supposed to serve the public? Now you're gonna tell me how to do my job, huh? I was there this afternoon. And you're gonna swear willard was driving the black car? I told you. We couldn't see the driver of the car. Hmm. Look, i thought he-- i thought he drove a brown car, but he could have 2 cars. Why don't you kids let me do my job? Faye? Yeah. Get dolan in here, please. Ok. Thank you. Billy? I'll see you later. Billy? Billy? At least one good thing happened today. What's that? Us. Hello, billy. This is ron devereaux. I've been thinking about our conversation and i'm sure your father would want me to help. So why don't you come by my house this afternoon? It's open, billy. Hi. Hey, killer dog. Yeah. Hey, how you doing? Listen, i got your call. Well, i've been thinking about it, billy, and i don't know what good i can do. But it's time i got off my ass, right? Try to do something. Think we should take a walk? Yeah. Ok. What time is it? Uh, it's about 7:00. It's early. I never seem to know where the time goes. Somewhere along the line, i lost track. Why did you retire? Don't ask. Let's talk about what you need. Ok. I need some evidence that's gonna nail willard. Listen, we went to his house today. You went to his house? Yeah. He tried to run us down. Us? I went with my girlfriend. Rule number one, sonny boy, you leave your girlfriend home. Ok. Ok. Look, we've gotta go back to willard's house to find some kind of evidence-- and what if he comes home? Wouldn't that be dangerous? No, he's in school during the day. Shouldn't you be in school during the day? Yeah. So what? I'll cut class. Wouldn't that make him suspicious? Look, don't worry about it. I always cut class. Oh, yeah? Yeah. So what do you think? I think you need my help. You mean it? Yeah. Oh, that is-- that is terrific. That is terrific. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, mr. Devereaux. Oh, uh, um, i'll meet you here tomorrow morning, ok? At 8:00. Hello? Hi, mrs. Colton. It's kelly. Is billy home? No. He went out somewhere. He said he had to go and get something. Kelly, uh, do you think... what? Nothing. I'm just being silly. Kelly? Nothing, mrs. Colton. I just called for a school assignment. Tell billy i'll call him later, ok? Thanks. Ooh. Oh. Fresh-squeezed orange juice, zachary. Fresh-squeezed. Zachary. Yes, yes. I heard you. When i'm ready, stanley. When i'm ready. Lots of pulp, like you like it. Like i like it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, well, uh, before you get your breakfast, i have a surprise for you. You have a surprise for me? Yeah. Stanley, you have a surprise for me? You have a surprise for me? Tada! Stupid idiot. That little tramp is one of my students. Where did you find her? She was snooping around outside the house last night. Well? Please don't be mad at me. I'm not. Come. I'm not gonna hit you. It's ok. I love you. I'm gonna be late, though. What about breakfast? I have no appetite for liver right now. Can you understand that, stanley? Just get rid of her. I wanna play. Stanley, how many times? I don't care how you do it just so long as she's gone by tonight. Ok. I'll do it. I'll do a good job, too. Ok. Ok. So, uh, what is all this stuff? The tools of my trade. A compass? You may want to find your way some day. Mr. Devereaux, don't--don't you have a gun? I don't believe in violence. But you're an ex-cop. You should have a gun. I solved all my cases with a keen analytical mind. Let's get to work. * And the rockets' red glare * the bombs bursting in * in * in what the hell? What? Stanley, is that little tramp's car parked in the alley? What tramp? I said, is that little tramp's car parked in the alley? I don't know nothin' about a car. How in the hell do you think she got here? I don't know. Don't you smirk. I'm not smirking. Did you find any keys? Here. Park it at k-mart. K-mart. What's that? K-mart? Where'd you get that? It's my father's. Why do you have it? We may need it. This guy's a killer. Benson's here. Robert burnstein. Here. Robert. Billy colton. Does anybody know where billy colton is? Hmm? That's the house. Interesting house. California craftsman bungalow. 1913 or 1915? What am i getting into? Gentlemen. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Was the, uh, colton boy in geography today? Not today. I thought he was suspended. At your request. It was not at my request. He was suspended for cause. Well, he probably got to catch some waves. Lucky dude. Please, please, please. "Dude"? Stop smoking, thornhill. It's disgusting. Mellow out, man. Come on. Boy, am i angry now. My brother zachary made me park that car over at k-mart, you know. Had a stick shift. Just for that, i'm going to read you a little nursery rhyme. Hansel and gretel. See my friend? Then she sees hansel with the skinny hands and dragged him into a little shed. The witch locked him in behind a door made of iron bars. Shit. "Step into my parlor said the spider to the fly." Ron, ron, that's it. That's the car. What are you talking about? That's the one that willard tried to run us down with. See? There's a hole in the windshield. Yeah, i know, i threw a watermelon through it. Watermelon? Yeah. Come on. I'm going around back. This window hasn't been opened in years. Here. Thanks. You know, this is breaking and entering. Yeah, well, you didn't expect him to invite us in, did you? Well, i was hoping. You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? No. Good. Huh? You're never gonna get away with this. How come? The police know about you. They do? They were here. They--they know about you. No. Get out. Ow! Ow! Shh. Shh. My back. I twisted my back. Oh. I can't go any further. Oh, man. Here. What do you want me to do with that? Take it. Use it if you have to. Ow! All right, come on. Come on. Get in here. Satan, sweet satan, give me breath during in death. Look out! You ok? Yeah. What kind of creep keeps a rattlesnake in his bedroom? I don't know. Look. Look at this. Ron, that's the robe that he wore when he killed lisa. Maybe we could use it as evidence. No, no. It's not enough. Why? I--i have this history of telling stories. I--i used to exaggerate a lot. You mean you used to tell a lot of lies? No, not lies. Stories. Just fun. But it's true now. Yeah. I understand. Listen, mr. Devereaux, i'm really glad you're here. That makes one of us. Come on. Let's get out of here. Ron, come here. Take a look at this. Does this guy have kids? Not that i know of. Scream all you like. Nobody'll hear you. No! Stop it! Holy shit. This is, uh, a little unnerving, billy. I think that we should get out of here. What's that? Pentagram, upside down. What do you think? Whoa! Satan, sweet satan, give me breath during in death. Satan, sweet satan, give me breath during in death. Billy, i lied to you, ok? I have to tell you the truth. It was a lie. I never was a detective. What are you talking about? I--i worked in forensics, ok? All i did was analyze evidence like fingerprints, and fibers from carpets and... billy, i--i solved all my crimes from a laboratory bench. Shh. Slow down. It's ok. It's all right. Are you mad at me? No, no. We got what we needed all right? Yeah? Let's get out of here. Oh, shit! Let's get out of here. Are you ok? Call the p-- call the police. Call the police.

Take care of her, guys. Billy. Billy. Billy, can you tell us what happened? How did you know zachary willard was a satanic killer? Well, uh, one of the girls he killed was my neighbor. Excuse me, folks. Billy's had a rough time. Why don't you save those questions until tomorrow, ok? Come on, captain. Sorry. Watch the cord. It's all over, kiddo. Yeah. Where'd you get that shotgun? It used to be my father's. One-man vigilante, huh? Yeah, i guess. What the hell are you doing here, ronald? Ron saved my life. This young man is a friend of mine, and, uh, he needed some help. Wait a minute. Ron, you guys know each other? Yeah, we worked together for years until he chose an early retirement.
