DAVYDOV as Olsen The events depicted in this film started with the appearance of a mysterious, strange creature. It looked like a human with fish scales and huge toad-like eyes. The fishermen dubbed him a "sea devil". One day his footprints were found on the beach. The local people claim that at night he was riding a dolphin, loudly blowing his horn. The newspapers reported that he had drowned a fishing boat, dragged two young nuns into the ocean and swallowed a pearl diver. Don Pedro! The sea devil has struck again! Such idiotic junk! Believe me, where there's smoke, there's fire. Nonsense. The devil! The devil! The sea devil! What's the matter, you lazy good-for-nothings? Why did you stop working? A curse on your worthless heads! Get back! The devil! - Who did you see? - The devil, Master. Then go and get acquainted with him. Let him cool down. He's seeing all kind of nonsense. Balthazar! How much do I owe you? You must be kidding. It's me who owes you lots of money. Then explain why your daughter is acting like a princess? I couldn't dream of a better husband for Gutiere than you. That's why I persuaded her to be your guest on your boat. You must show her what a nice man you are. I've done nothing else lately! You don't seem to notice me. I've noticed how you kicked Christo overboard. Wait a minute, Gutiere! It's true that sometimes I'm rough with others. But with you... I love you. I can offer you both my name and my fortune. You're not one who gives away so much for nothing. That's how you repay me for my kindness. Must I pay already? - You can't get away by running! - Then I'll swim! She's got a will of her own! Father! Send my things ashore! That's too much! Come back now! You better go get her. There's a shark! Gutiere! Help! Didn't you see the shark? We're afraid of the sea devil! Swine! Easy now. Poor little darling! It's a miracle. I saw the shark myself. - All of us saw it. - I saw it too. I split the shark wide open. I understand everything, father. I wish I could love him. But I can't help it. Listen, Gutiere... What will become of us? You know how many debts we have. Think of me and my old age. I hope you're feeling better. Yes, thank you, Don Pedro. She wants to tell you something important. Really? You tell him, father. Don't worry. You can make a public announcement. She will marry you. To Gutiere! To you! And to our children! Your daughter won't be sorry. I'm rich as I am. But soon, I'll be fantastically rich. You know, I have an idea. I'm going to get rid of those bums and employ just one pearl diver. Guess who it will be! The sea devil! Come on. An hour ago, you didn't believe in his existence. I still don't believe in any sea devil. But this is some smart creature living under water. I've seen him as close as you now. - Where? - Never mind. I've seen him. Miss, are you all right? I came to find out how you are. The devil! The sea devil is out there! Down there, on the anchor! Get the nets ready! Hurry! We won't risk our necks going after the sea devil. Move! The net! Maybe you just imagined it? No, I didn't, father! He talked to me. Faster! Use some muscle! Hurry! I'll get him! No matter what it costs me! You coming in with me on this? - But I got no money... - Never mind that! I'll lend you the money. You're in the family now. Once we've got this creature, then we'll settle up. I see this place is still under seven locks. Come in, Mr. Olsen. Please, wait here. Ah, Olsen! It's been a long time! It wasn't easy getting in. It wasn't intended to keep you away. Break those secret doors. Don't bury yourself alive. I have my reasons to be afraid of people. Twenty years ago a band of ignorant fools destroyed my laboratory. They even tried to shoot me. I hope you're not accusing the entire human race of being as unprincipled as those vandals. You still treat patients, don't you? I'm a scientist. That's my duty. Dear friend, I've come here for two reasons. First, what can Dr. Salvatore tell our newspaper about the sea devil? Devils don't exist, either in the sea or on land. That's all you can print as my statement. Couldn't it be some creature not yet known to scientists? You must be hungry. Will you join me for breakfast? He's been seen here several times. Dive in once more, Balthazar. - Drop the anchor. - Good! You look like a pirate! With such knives my forefathers would slice out the stomachs of anyone who go in their way. - Well, what? - I saw... - What? Him? - No. His burrow. It leads somewhere over there. - Who lives up there? - God. Quit joking. I'm not joking. He must be a god. He makes lame people walk, he gives blind people their sight. We've got a devil in the bay and some god over it... It's the home of the great Dr. Salvatore. We won't waste our time then. But that tunnel, that's where we're going to catch him. Last week the prosecutor read my article and a fine was imposed on our newspaper. We don't have any money, our newspaper is for poor people. Won't you be willing to lend us ten thousand? Otherwise, we'll be closed. My dear Olsen! If it's for you, you have only to ask. But I won't give anything for your newspaper. Thank you very much, but personally, I don't need a thing. With me it's a matter of principle, not to get involved in politics. So let's leave everything the way it is? Not at all! The unfortunate people should be helped. Not by a politician, or a newspaper man, but by a scientist. - Really? - Yes. - And that means you? - Exactly! I will lead the poor to a land of abundance where no one will oppress them. Where to? Heaven? The moon? No. To the ocean! At the bottom of the ocean, there're neither poor nor wealthy. Everyone will be free and happy there. Will it be a republic of the drowned? Don't laugh. I am letting you in on a great secret. Can you imagine an ocean populated by people capable of breathing under water like fishes? Dear friend, that sounds like a fairy tale. No, it's not a fairy tale. Come with me. lchthyander! The sea devil! If you don't mind. It's my son, lchthyander. The first citizen of the underwater republic. Change your clothes and come back here. All right, father. As a young boy, he contracted an incurable lung disease. In a desperate attempt to save him I replaced his lungs with the gills of a shark. This risky operation was a success. That's when I got the idea of creating an underwater republic. I bow before your surgeon's skill. But your idea of the underwater republic is an utopian dream. What's to prevent poor and rich from springing up again? I've already read all that in your newspaper. Suppose you plant gills in everybody who wants them. Human nature won't change. People will miss the land. Let's stop this discussion. Don't be afraid. This is my friend, Olsen. Tell me, you... Don't you miss people, the land? Today you have learned more than enough. And remember, not a word to anyone! Did you forget what you were supposed to bring me back? Did I ask you for that? Stop that. You're behaving like a little boy. You've been attracting quite a bit of attention. I don't want people to know about you. The newspapers are printing ridiculous tales about you. Father, I saved a girl's life yesterday. She was drowning. Did she see you? I don't think so. She was unconscious. She is very beautiful. But her eyes are so sad. How much I would like to see her smile. Put your notes in order... And go to bed. Father, I want to sleep in the sea tonight. It's not good for you to be in the water all the time. It might be bad for your lungs. We would, we would, we would cross the sea line. We would, we would, we would drink a lot of wine. With the ocean over, Whether we're drunk or sober, No one will ever care a dime. Hey, the sailor! You've made too long your travel. I've forgotten even how you look. Now I'm in love With the seafaring devil. I have got him fast on my hook! Weigh anchor, At attention, pause. Over at the rhumb line, Steady on the course! To that sea-roving bum We'll take a barrel of rum. The devil will be tempted, of course! Hey, the sailor! You've made too long your travel. I've forgotten even how you look. Now I'm in love With the sea-roving devil. I have got him fast on my hook. Olsen, lchthyander has left for town. He doesn't know anyone but you there. Try to find him! All right. I will. A fisherman leaves the danger to seek And bids farewell to his wife. He may go to sleep on the bottom of the sea and never return to life. He keeps to wave from his boat deck As long as the shore he can see. If the fisherman didn't come back, He found his peace in the sea. He'd rather lie in the darkness, The cool darkness to the end Than go on suffering On this cruel and tough land. The years will fly and flock, The waves will surge and rock, And the gloomy, black cities Will disappear in the white fog. His wife will fall on the ground and weep. The fisherman explain could not That he had chosen in the sea, blue and deep, The most beautiful road. His orphaned children he'd only beg To forgive him and try to see If the fisherman didn't come back, He found his peace in the sea. He'd rather lie in the darkness, The cool darkness to the end Than go on suffering On this cruel and tough land. Have a cup of coffee. Go on, take it. Please! Wait! Why are you running away? Hasen! Have you seen a young man, a bit taller than me, with black curly hair and blue eyes? What kind of shoes was he wearing? I can't tell you that. What are you doing? Let me go! Help! Stop the thief! Here, everybody, take some fish. There's plenty! Take it! What is going on here? This madman is giving away all my fish. Why is he so greedy? There's plenty of fish in the ocean. You'd better pay him. Do you have any money? - Money? - Yes. I don't know. Are you really mad? I think I've got some. Is that enough? A crazy millionaire! There's no tastier drink than yours in the whole city. - Another one? - No, thank you. I'd better be going. Did you pawn your watch again? They shut the paper down. And as if it's not enough trouble. My friend's son has run away. I've covered the entire city. Gutiere, may I borrow your car? To go look for that boy. We have sold our car. You've been away for too long. You seemed to think I was coming too often. Please, don't start this, Olsen. - Listen, Olsen. - Yes? I'd like to do something to help your paper. I was given a pearl necklace. You could pawn it. Thank you. It's locked up in my father's safe. Let's meet tomorrow at the Black Rock. All right? All right. - Who were you talking to? - Just an old friend. My fiancee might be a little more discreet. Maybe we ought to use thicker rope? Don't worry. He'll never break out of this. Look... What can I do for you? - Hi! - How do you do? What a strange town this is. And the people are strange, too. Pardon me, but what do you want? Who are you? You don't know me, but I've seen you once before. You keep your hands to yourself. Wait! I came here to tell you I'm in love with you. So it's love at first sight? There really isn't any other love, is there? Another old friend? Go to your father, dear. You leave her alone. She doesn't want to. Can't you see? Get out of here! Does he own this place? Then I won't go. Oh, yes you will! Let's go some place else. Police! - Father! - Get away! Run! Don't let him get away! It's all because of you. All the troubles you've caused me. It's a miracle that you came back in one piece. I must go back there again today. Again? Was it for nothing I kept you hidden away from them? You're happier than they are. You're the master of the sea. I don't want to live among the fishes anymore. I will die of loneliness. Why did you make me to be not a man. You must never doubt that you are a man. If I'm a man, I have the right to be in love. Very well then, go. But you'd better go by sea. It will be less dangerous. Thank you, father! I promise I'll be careful. Pull in at my command. And look sharp! Pull up, hurry! Come on, up! Faster! Come on! Move! Shoot! Don't shoot! Damn you all! I told you we had to have a heavier rope! - I'll be better off without you. - Don Pedro!.. Let's settle up. How much do you owe me? Don Pedro, I'm almost your father-in-law. You've been leading me on with that wedding. The wedding will be on Saturday. I swear! Goodbye, daddy! I'm going! Wait a minute! I told Don Pedro you'll marry him on Saturday. Father, I haven't made my mind up yet. We gave him our word. We owe him so much. I will never forget it, but... Be reasonable. Let's sell the necklace and prepare the dowry. The necklace? I don't have it anymore, father. Are you waiting for your friend? I'm so glad they didn't catch you. Before, I felt good only under water. Now I feel good only when I'm together with you. You're talking as if we've known each other for a long time. And yet I don't even know what your name is. - My name is lchthyander. - And mine's Gutiere. - Gutiere! Like to dance? - No. Why not? What have you done? My pearl necklace is in that bag! Pearls? The necklace is in the water. That stranger dived in for it. And Sanchez followed him. It's no use! Too deep! Sanchez! Where's the boy who was the first to jump? You'll have to find him by yourself. There he is! I never thought you were going to come back up. Thank you very much. Thank you. Are you a sailor? I mustn't say who I am. I'm sorry. Another mystery. Gutiere! Just a minute! Come with me! I'd better not. - Why not? - He's in love with you. Whoever gave you that idea? It's obvious from the way he looks at you. I'll come back tomorrow when you're alone. - Who were you talking to? - He's a marvelous young man. - Where did he come from? - Appeared out of the blue. You've never said this about me. They'll be amazed at the pawnshop. In a month I'll return it to you. I really appreciate it, Gutiere. I keep on imagining that we've met somewhere before. It must have been in a dream. But since we became acquainted, I've grown afraid of the sea. There's nothing to be afraid of. The sea is a gentle place. When there's a storm up here, the bottom is calm and peaceful. lchthyander! Here, look. - Good heavens! How lovely! - I want you to have them. For me? Take them back, or we'll quarrel. Why? I want you to keep them. I can't accept it. Please take them. No. Listen to me, lchthyander! Why did you throw the pearls into the sea? I would have given you my life, but you wouldn't even accept the pearls. That means you don't believe in my love. You don't love me. On Saturday I'm supposed to be getting married. But I won't be, because I've met you. Do you understand? - Follow me! Quick! - There he is! Hold out your hands. All right. Why? Because he almost killed me. Where's my daughter's necklace? That's not him! He never stole the necklace! - That's the end of him. - He won't come up. We'll live in the suburbs at my villa. lt'll be nice to roll round in the grass at my age. Not at my villa, you won't. Oh, by the way, you'll want a check... Gutiere, how could you ever let this happen? It makes no difference any more. Father will pay his debts now. Get a new net. Set it up over the hole and don't move until you've caught him. Good luck! The new mistress of the Villa Dolores. I must see her. You have forgotten too soon about this. Even so, I've got to see her. So you're here again. - She's locked herself in. - Break the door. Be a man for once. You're too soft on her. But I love her. And you sleep at her door like a puppy! Some man! Gutiere! It's getting ridiculous. What's the matter? - Have you caught the sea devil? - No, no, no. Then what are you doing here? Who's watching the net? There isn't any net. - And the money? - There's no money either. - You drank it up, eh? - I want to see my daughter. Are you keeping her locked up? Pedro, you're hurting me. I dreamed of seeing Gutiere rich and happy. I will not permit you to torture her. She is the one who's torturing me. Get out of here! Put him out, and never let him come in here again! Let go of me! Gutiere! Are you awake? Don't get scared. It's me. Good heavens! I thought you were drowned. Pedro, her door may be closed to you, but her window is open to another man. I was heartbroken. I thought you had drowned. I didn't. I can breathe under water. That's why people call me the sea devil. But I'm human. My father is Dr. Salvatore. Forgive me for not having told you my secret before. I'm so happy you're alive! But why have you married another man? I believed you had drowned. Don Pedro saved me from the shark. - It was I who saved you. - You did? If only you said so! What have you done! It's not too late yet. I'm not going to give you up to anybody! Come on! Hey, boy, give me a paper! The latest news! Hey, boy! Come here. Take this to Olsen at the newspaper. Go on! Go on, jump in! And bring me back a pearl. I'm not going to keep you here for long. I spent a lot of money on a net. Who's going to reimburse me? A few pearls, and I'll let you go. You'll let me go? You mean that? My word of honor. Scoundrels! In forty minutes he brings back a whole fortune... Good boy! Hop in again. You gave your word. Why, I'd have strangled you if I didn't need you! Get back to work, you toad! I'm not going back in the water! This will change your mind for you! Beat him until he comes to his senses. A submarine! Collision course! Why the hell is it coming here? Lash this toad fast to an anchor and drop him over. Scoundrels! Let go of him! Do we have any guns? What's that? This is a harpoon canon effective at a range of 100 yards. That won't be much help. Captain, you're keeping the son of Dr. Salvatore. We demand that you release him at once! We've never heard of him! Lay off! This is an automatic canon. The very first shell will blow your tub out of the water. Throw your guns in the water! To the count of two! One! Two! Get a boat ready! You've got my son. We have no strangers aboard. Word of honor. He is here! They have him tied to the anchor! Make them lift the anchor! Order your man to raise it, or we'll shoot. Hey! Up the anchor! - Is that the girl? - Yes, father. Father, I won't go without her. Open that cabin. You can't take her. She is my wife. There's nothing we can do. The law is on his side. Here's a souvenir for you! We can't stay here. We'll have to leave. - But where? - We'll go to the Southern Seas. We'll make a fresh start. To set up an underwater republic is not that easy. My plans have been frustrated by a mere chance. There're no guarantees against such criminals as Zurita. But if it hadn't been Zurita, it would have been someone else... What a waste to spend your skills on a futile dream. I think everything will be all right. Doctor! The police are here! Run! They can't do anything to me. Dr. Salvatore, you're under arrest. And you must be lchthyander? You're under arrest, too. - Who have you got? - Salvatore and his son. Where have you hidden the son? That's the reporter, Olsen. Why didn't you tell me? You wouldn't have believed me. I resemble Dr. Salvatore so much. Don't waste your wisecracks on us. You'll have your turn soon enough. Thank you, but don't hurry on my account. We've got him, the pretty boy! Dr. Salvatore arrested! Sea Devil caught! Pirates attack Schooner Medusa! Pedro Zurita brings charges! Excuse me, Doctor. - Do you remember me? - No, I don't. And I will always remember you. You saved my son's life. Oh, yes... How is he getting on? A visitor for the doctor. Doctor, it grieves me to see you here. - But if you permit me... - What do you want? I can return you your freedom, your laboratory, money... - You? - Yes, precisely. I can get you out of here, but you... You'll create thousands like lchthyander. Think of it, doctor! We'll conquer the ocean. We'll be the richest people on earth! - Get out! - Calm down! Your life and the life of your son depend on my word. Just hope they hang you before him! You're a scoundrel! A skulking dog! You shouldn't get so upset, doctor. You haven't any other way. Don't be afraid of them, doctor. I will help you to escape. You said that I'd saved your son's life once. I must ask you to save my boy. What about you? I can't get both of you out. I'm an old man. It makes no difference where I die. As you wish. Do you have any friends you can rely on? Yes, I do. Who is there? It's me. Go home, father. Don Pedro is still up. Open up! What happened, father? "Tomorrow I will help lchthyander escape to Australia. "Do you want to go with him? Olsen." Not only does he escape, but he wants my wife beside! Police! I beg of you on my knees... Don Pedro... Police! Hallo. This is the police. Speak up! Who is calling? Police, send someone over to the villa Dolores. I have murdered a man. Gutiere! Open the door, quickly! You must go to Olsen's. And what about you, father? I've got things to do here. Here's the entrance. The main cell block. We'll come out this way. You have to park the truck over here. Everything's clear. So, Mr. Olsen, it'll be at 9 sharp. Let's check our watches. Now you can say goodbye to him, Doctor. Come on out now! Father! Father! Have they kept you in that tank all the time? Yes. Scoundrels! They've probably ruined your lungs! Forgive me, son. I tried to make you the happiest man in the world. And I destroyed your happiness entirely. Forgive me, and farewell. What about you? Farewell! Time's up. Got a pass? All right, drive in. Leave the gates open. I'll dump this and go back. What's that truck? I didn't give any pass for it. Go to that truck. He's been waiting for you. Don't lose time. Move! It's a fake! Sound the alarm! Olsen... I'm dying... Did they hit you? What is it? I can't breathe. I can live only in the water. I think we got away from them. What's wrong with him? Tell me! Is he dead? He's alive! But a terrible thing has happened. lchthyander won't be able to breathe air any more. He'll have to live in the water from now on. That's it. I was forbidden to love you. Still, I loved you. They separated us, but I found the way back. Now that all our troubles are mostly behind us, I have to say goodbye to you. I will always miss the land. And the land will always remember you. I'm sure you'll be happy one day. I want you to be happy. We mustn't wait too long. I will do everything in my power to free your father from prison. Thank you. Farewell. The end
