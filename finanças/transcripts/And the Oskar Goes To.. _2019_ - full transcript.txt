Okay? Let’s go. Which grade are you in? 4th grade. It’s a sad story. Why would audience spend their money on such tragedies? Why do we care? He has money. He’s making a film. But remember. We should collect our remuneration every day. No one knows when such productions would be shelved. What’s the matter? Come in. Why did you wake up so early? I couldn’t fall asleep. We just started shooting. We have a lot of work ahead of us. Don’t risk your health. We can’t shoot on that hill. But you said we have permission. I thought there’d be no issue. But the man that land belongs to… He’s being stubborn. We can shoot that scene elsewhere. There are a bunch of other locations. But that hill is the perfect location for the scene. I’d often notice Moeen Khan on that hill when I was a kid. Those visuals are etched in the back of my head. Then we better go for that location only. But, what about permissions? I have an idea! That scene where the temple committee helps Moeen Khan… Yes. Let’s shoot that today. Okay. Done. Inform the Art Director. Okay. I’ll take care of that. We need the house set-up. Perfect! Why do you look so tanned? I was under the sun all day long. Were you farming a land or what? Where’s dad? He’s asleep. We tend to sleep in the midnight around here. I asked my husband if I could come watch the shooting. Like he’s every going to approve. I bought some jewelry for the shoot. Imitation jewelry. And I bought these for you. Looks like real gold. You didn’t have to do this. I know you’re short of money. We have gold jewelry at home. 2 days. Just for 2 days. I need your gold for mortgaging it. I swear by Allah, I’ll repay your debt. It’s true that my son is on the verge of dying in Saudi Jail. I need your help to save his life. You find gold at a jewelry shop. Similarly, vegetables at a general store. Cut! Sir, it’s not vegetables. It’s groceries. Why would you say vegetables? How many times will you get it wrong? I have to say the line while counting money. So, I’m getting a bit confused. Let’s go through the lines one more time, sir. Sorry, brother. The line is… Sir, give me my payment. I’ve got to go. I’ll pay all of you as soon as this scene is completed. Okay? Wait for some time. Ready, sir? Okay. Ready, sir. Shall we go for a take? Ready, sir? Okay. Ready. Sound! Sound rolling. Camera… Rolling, sir. 30/5. Take 14. Action! You find gold at a jewelry shop. Similarly, groceries at a general store. Likewise, when you come to us… We need to find that you have jewelry or land to mortgage. This isn’t a business where I lend money on interest. It’s a mortgage business. Get me something as surety if you want the money. Cut. Take okay. Go get it. I found it hard to say the lines while counting the money, sir. Sir, the money… Give it, sir! Good acting! Here, bro. This is for fuel. Give only 5K to some of them. We’ll pay the balance amount later. Hello, sir. Hello. How did your son’s exams go? Two more to go, sir. We’ll schedule the shoot after his exams. Can we talk for a minute, sir? Oh. Alright. It’s nothing really. I heard the story of your movie. It’s really good. I know you’re struggling to gather the money. This is 25K. I was paid 50K as location fee for shooting in my house. To be honest, I only asked for 25K. But your Manager made it 50K. He also took half the amount back. Keep this, sir. I don’t want to take money for your movie shoot. It’s not fair to disturb them at this time. Let’s wait for them to wake up. Okay, sir. It’s me. Issak. What are you doing here so early, Issak? Is uncle awake? No. Let me wake him. What’s he doing here so early? Issak, I saw your missed calls. Uncle, the to and fro journey to your place takes me about 7-8 hours. I started as soon as I was done shooting last night. I have to shoot again in the morning. I sold the land for such a small amount because… I desperately needed the money. If you don’t give me the money now… If I fail to arrange the money by morning… Shooting will be called off. It’s really hard to resume shoot again, uncle. Issak, I don’t mean to trouble you. My friend is on some foreign trip with some Arab friend. His phone is out of connectivity. I’ll deposit the total amount in your account by afternoon. I assure you that. Go. Hmm. Sir, he’s here to play Afzal as a child. Take them to the location immediately. Which grade are you in? 7th grade, sir. Cool. Okay, sir. I just need 10 minutes to freshen up. You guys head to the location. There’s a small problem. Light men are refusing to work unless we clear the dues. Payments are delayed all the time. Cancelling the shoot is not an option. Kabir, money will be ready by afternoon. I assured them that they’ll be paid today. But they’re refusing to step out of their rooms. It’d be humiliating if Aravind sir found out about this. I have an idea. Let’s plan a scene where we don’t need light men. Just call the camera assistants. It’s not so easy. They’re all in this together. None of them will cooperate. Even the Production Chief will hold back the food if his dues aren’t cleared. Guys, Chitra is here. Don’t tell her about any of this. Hey! Haven’t seen you in so long. She’s quite busy these days. I’m not in your Profession. I’m an employee. I have a lot of responsibilities. Take a seat. Come. We had a feature on your film on our channel. Yeah, right. I didn’t watch it. But people told me that it was really good. Mom loved it. I thought you must’ve left for shoot already. I asked Manu about you. He told me you were here. This is the money I saved for my marriage. You should pay me back in full. Issak… In case you can’t pay me back… Don’t tell me you’d marry me as compensation. Kabir… Keep this. Ask everyone to get ready. Wait for 10 minutes. I’ll go freshen up and come. Let’s go to shoot together. My new film’s shoot is starting tomorrow. I’d have to leave to Chennai tonight. Ask the Manager to book the flight ticket. Okay, sir. We’ll try finishing all the planned scenes. Thank you. Hi, sir. Hello. Sir, you like his look? Umm… Afzal’s beard and moustache have been trimmed in the Saudi Jail. So, I think we should trim it a bit. Okay, sir. Alright then. See you, sir. He’s playing Afzal, sir. Oh. So, tell me this. Muslims grow their beards long and trim their moustache and hair. What’s the theory behind that? In Islam, beard is considered a sign of manhood. Muslims from Andhra and Telangana differ a lot traditionally. Especially Hyderabad Muslims… Issak, you have a minute? Yeah. Excuse me, sir. What’s the matter? Come with me. Main actress didn’t arrive yet. But it’s getting late. Ask him to come fast. She wants her account settled right now. Explain our situation clearly. I tried my best convincing her. But she’s hell bent on having her dues cleared today. Where do I get the money from now? There’s only one option. Go to her room and convince her somehow. Yes, you should go. Sir, good morning. Good morning. Please come. Sit down. I didn’t get the money like I had planned. I need some more time to clear your payment. In my whole career, people owed me more money than what I got paid. Every time the shoot would be over, I’d have to go to their offices for the payment. I don’t know about others. But I’m not expecting profits from this movie. I’m only looking to minimize the loss. Throughout my life, I never had to request anyone for anything. I’ll definitely pay you despite how the movie fares. All I can give you right now is my promise. Please help me finish this movie. Mom… Dad… Afzal… Cut! Manu… Sir, that’s good? Yes. Okay, Manu? Superb take! We like it? Pack up! Today was my last day of shoot. My childhood dream of making a film was fulfilled. Thank you, everyone, who helped me make my film. I can’t begin to describe the technicians’ love and affection for me. I’m forever grateful to Mr. Aravind and Siva Kumar for their support. A big thanks to all. Thank you. Moeen Bhai, Ibrahim’s second son Issak is making a film apparently. It’s your life story. You knew about that? I also heard. Maybe you’ll get lucky with this film. You’re really a lucky man. Shut up, guys! Wait till the end of shoot and file a case. They’ll meet your demands. Didn’t you read about it in the news? Some guy did the same thing and earned in millions. You wouldn’t have to go shop-to-shop, selling treats anymore. You’re right. But he wouldn’t take our advice. That’s there. He’s in his own world all the time. Ignore him. We can’t help it, you know. He’s never going to change. Look at him leave. Like we care. He’ll realize some day. So, Issak… You came to Hyderabad alone? I must cut down on expenses, sir. Right. I can’t afford to travel with someone in this position. So I came alone. Is Prasad available? He’s inside, sir. Okay. Let’s go. Did you find a distributor? I’ve shown the film to a few. They really liked it. But they feel that such films don’t fare at box-office. Censor members said Aravind sir will definitely take home an award. Come. Prasad, good morning. Hi! Good morning, sir. How are you? Fine. Fine. Please. Hello, sir. This is Issak. Hi. Hello. Please sit. He has made a beautiful film in Telugu. good. I really believe in that film. Today is the last date to enroll for the National Awards. So, we need the material. Why not? Definitely. So, what’s the movie called? ‘A Sky of Fireflies’ Indu… ‘A Sky of Fireflies’ account status? It’s on my table? Okay. I’ll check. Total 9 lakhs. Only 1 lakh has been credited. I brought 2 lakhs, sir. Prasad, you should only support him. Don’t mind me saying this, sir. We gave the material to other production houses before. They’re nowhere to be found now. Their duty is still pending. You know everything, sir. Technology is advancing every day. Last year’s camera is outdated now. Even we need to survive, right? Okay. I guarantee you that he’ll settle the account. How much do we have to pay right now for the material? Pay 6 lakhs now. I’ll give you the material on his word. Alright. I’ll arrange that amount. Ask your men to keep the material ready. Let’s go. See you. Sir, here’s the money you asked for. Give it to him. Take it, sir. Issak! Hey, Issak! Moeen Khan is here for you. Why is she showing up every time you visit? What does he need from you? Salam-Alaikum! Alaikum-Salam! It’s nothing really. I was passing by. Thought I’d come see you. How are you? I’m good. How’s work? It’s going well. Oh. I wanted to ask you something. Is it possible to help me with 2000 rupees? Oh. See you then. Okay. What did he need? Hello. Where are you? In my hometown, sir. When are you coming back? This afternoon. Okay. Come to my place when you do. Why, sir? Just come. I have something to tell you. Okay. Central Government has announced the National Awards today. Hindi film ‘Saal’ has won 4 National Awards. Actress Sheetal won the ‘Best Actress’ award. It’s amazing that it’s Sheetal’s debut film. After 6 years, a Telugu Actor has won an award. ‘Best Actor’ goes to Aravind… For the film ‘A Sky of Fireflies’. Who do you think is more important to a film? Actor or Director? There have been many films where a fly, rat and cat have played the lead. But a fly, rat and cat didn’t direct those films. Everything turned in our favor when Aravind sir won the award. I got a good rate for the satellite rights. With Aravind sir’s help, I found a good distributor as well. Cinema received good response from the public. Many felicitations and appreciation functions followed. I repaid all my debt. Here’s the money I took from you. I’m paying you in full like you asked. Thank you! I also have a small gift for you. Gift? It’s really nice. Moeen uncle… Thank you. Every time I’d visit home, Moeen uncle would take a little money from me. In simple words, I saved some cash. Repaid all the loans I took for my film. When Aravind won that award for the film… Some of our friends threw a huge party. When we saw you on TV that day, we danced like crazy. Everyone’s gushing about you now. But it was me who initially bragged about you. I want to meet Aravind once. Everyone say he’s really short-tempered and an ego-maniac. Is that true? Hey! I want to click a selfie with you and Aravind, and post it on Facebook. Issak, they recognized you. You’re pretty famous now. You’re over-imagining stuff. They may not have seen a single film in their life. There are so many people out there who don’t recognize film actors, directors and producers. I watched your film, sir. It was amazing. Thank you. I teared up in the theatre. Your name? Santosh, sir. Where are you originally from? Araku. There are many people from Araku here. Oh. Where did you study? I pursued MBA in Bangalore, sir. Why are you working here then? Making films is my ambition, sir. I’m waiting for a chance. Top directors and producers like yourself visit this place. So, I took up this job. Debutant Director Issak Ebrahem’s ‘A Sky of Fireflies’… has been selected for the Oscars under the ‘Foreign Film’ category. ‘A Sky of Fireflies’ is the first ever Telugu film to be selected for the Oscars. Congrats, man! Your cinema is going to take you places. Congratulations, sir. Thank you. Let me call Aravind sir. Your movie budget was just 50 lakhs. The kind of promotion you do for Oscar films costs 3 times more. How are you going to manage? Even the highest budget films fail to promote themselves at the Oscars. You believe this small film will get you a nomination? Do you think your film will garner attention at the Oscars? I don’t have the answer for any of these. But I’ll definitely represent my film there. So now that you’ve seen all the nominated films… It’s time to find out who’ll take home the Oscar. Please welcome the respected, the beloved, the adorable… Dee Lopez. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. When you’re pulled off the red carpet and asked to do a favor… And here I’m standing in front of several hundred million people worldwide. The lesson is… Always listen to your wife when she tells you to wear the good tuxedo. Okay. To the business at hand. And the Oscar goes to… Very few people are showing up for the prayer. They stay up with their cell phones al night. Salam-Alaikum! Salam-Alaikum! Coming from Hyderabad? Yes. See you. I heard he’s going to America with his film. Yeah, right. Like America is desperate for his attention. There are many decent jobs out there. Why is he into a sinful profession like cinema? Everyone says his film is really good. There’s no good cinema and bad cinema. Cinema is a sinful act. Stop with your statements. Cinema is nowhere mentioned in the Quran. You’ve only read Quran casually. You need to dive deeper to understand such stuff. You hypocrite! You banned us from learning English. Then you went ahead and opened an English Medium school. You denied us from watching TV. And then inaugurated a TV channel of your own. I’m saying this in the name of Allah. You’ll watch movies real soon and make one for that matter. Don’t bring Allah into this. Umm… Do you know how much it costs to go to the US? What’s your problem? He didn’t ask you for the money. Why are you bothered? Oh, yeah? I have many Indian friends in Gulf. Especially in Qatar. We’ve come together to form Associations. In the last meeting, I introduced a policy. When there’s a famous person amongst us, we felicitate him. Now they want to book a date. It’s great if they want to felicitate Issak. I only handled everything. Issak… You play. Will this Oscars thing make us any money? I don’t think so. Can we expect an Oscar for your film? It’s pretty tough. In that case, why should we spend so much on it? He himself doesn’t believe that he’ll get the award. Moeen Khan is here to see you. He’s the first one to find out that you’re home. Don’t go. I’ll talk to him. When someone succeeds in life, they take advantage of him. I’ll make sure he never shows up at our doorstep again. No. I’ll go talk to him. Sadiq told me you arrived this morning. I don’t want it now. I’ll only ask you when I need it. You got into deep trouble by making my life story into a movie. The whole village stood by me in saving Arshad. But you’re alone in this battle. Prepping for going to the Oscars? Don’t get disappointed about the money it’s going to take. If I had been disappointed, Arshad wouldn’t have been alive today. You’re really capable and smart. I want to give you some advice. Go meet Resul Pookutty. He’ll be able to give you the best advice. If you hope for everything to go well and pray whole heartedly… Allah will make sure that it manifests. See you. And the Oscar goes to… ‘Slumdog Millionaire’-Richard Pryke, Ian Tapp and Resul Pookutty. ‘I come from a country and civilization…’ ‘that gave the universe a word.’ ‘That word is preceded by silence.’ ‘Followed my more silence.’ ‘That word is Aum’. ‘So, I dedicate this award to my country.’ Hello, Issak. I watched your movie. It was great. Please sit. Thank you, sir. Your film has the worth to make it to the nominations. I just wanted to make a good movie. No doubt about that. But you need to market your film well. I’m not sure how. There’s a Special Jury for the ‘Foreign Film’ category. You must make sure they all watch our film. We need a good PR agent for that. That agent will handle everything thereafter. Hmm. Issak might have been influenced by my performances in other films. Or he might have seen his character inside of me. Where’s mine? Seriously? You ask me now? The bar is right there. But a good movie won’t be ignored. It will find an audience. Right. Just because I love some film in my level, doesn’t mean it will get the recognition it deserves. The characters do might be brilliant. But good luck if it isn’t well made. There was a Moroccan movie that was shown at the Cannes. It’s their official entry and brilliantly made. With good marketing, it will get nominated. Sorry I have to interrupt. We love you! I love you too. It’s just that I’m trying to make a name for myself. And I’m just feeling a little out of my depth. Get to the point. Okay. India just announced their official selection. It’s an independent film by Director/Producer. And if I have my way, I’m going to be lobbying it to the Academy. Oh, wow! Congratulations! You go, girl! Lovely! Our film has reached a wider audience, thanks to the Oscars. I made this film for the much ordinary audience. Wasn’t expecting the success at all. When a film wins the National Award… Hi! This is Maria calling from Los Angeles. I was hoping to speak with Issak, please. He’s in the middle of an interview. Can I ask him to call you later? Oh, okay. Sure. I’m sorry. Who’s this? Chitra. Chitra. Very cool. Thank you. Bye. Okay. Moeen Khan has gained me a never-before popularity. You’re right, sir. Abhishek… Yes, sir. What about promotions? We should market the movie well. Issak, meet me at the location if you’re free. Sure, sir. See you. Thank you, sir. I’ll get going then. Okay, sir. Sir, your phone. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I can’t believe you’re here! Chitra called. Told me you were here. I didn’t want to interrupt your interview. Let’s go. Come. You got a call. Issak, they’re my friends. They want a picture with you. Hello. You’re good with it? Of course! Thank you, sir. Sure. Thank you, sir. Yeah. What about your movie? Script is ready. I want Aravind sir to play the lead. Oh. Issak sir, if you could recommend… Issak sir! I’ll talk to him. We’ve grown so far apart, huh? Hi! First off, my company and I would like to congratulate you on your achievement. Thank you. Yeah! You’re totally welcome. I’m going to send you a link to our company profile. We really want you to get to know us… and really want to market your movie here. I’m also going to send along some marketing schedules… and a list of ways we think would be successful in getting your film out there. So, I’m also going to send you a copy of your agreement. Just read it, sign it, send it back. And just so you know, there is a 25 percent fee at the start. It is 10,000 dollars. Okay. Okay? Great! So, we’re already late on marketing. We really want to get ahead and go with those events now. Just so you know, the more we spend, the more we can market. Go through the email. And if you have any questions at all, just let me know. Sure. Excellent! Well, I’ll talk to you soon. Good night, sir. Good night. Issak… Sir? You might make greater films in the future. But an opportunity like this might not knock again. Good luck. Thank you, sir. Let’s go. Hello. It’s Moeen speaking. Hey, Moeen uncle. Where are you? I came to Hyderabad for my VISA. Oh. I called to tell you that I bought a new phone. I saved every penny, so that I could talk to you from anywhere. Arshad had a good friend in Saudi during his work period. He’s living in Los Angeles now. Why don’t you meet him? He’ll be of help. And, save this number under my name. Sure. How much? 60 rupees. Here. Oi! Issak! Issak…! Sudhakar bro… I watched your film. It was amazing to be honest. I’ve been meaning to gift you something nice whenever we meet. Can I do that now? Sure. Nice. You made a good movie. Thank you so much. Come. Let’s sit. What would you like, sir? One dosa and one omelet. And you? I just ate. So, what’s up? You know that lawyer story… I only wrote it. Made a few changes now. I’m trying to quit associate direction and direct my own film. A friend of mine from Gulf offered to invest. I’ll take finance for the remaining amount. It will work out. I’m telling you. It’ll definitely work out. Sure. Let me pay. Hey! I also have money. Look. I’m teaching acting to school kids. I have a source of income. How much? Oh, no. My daughter. Anu. She’s in 9th grade. Draws really well. Sings amazingly well too. Uh-huh? I always keep her photograph with me. In my pocket, wallet or my bag… Even when I book a hotel room… I place it somewhere it’s highly visible. In life, when I feel like I’ve lost… Like there’s no point in staying alive anymore… I see her photo and feel like living again. Alright then. How much? 40. Here. See you. I find some excuse to stay alive. Is it Issac Ibraham? No. It’s Issak Ebrahem. No. It’s Issac Ibraham. No. It’s Issak Ebrahem. I’m a Muslim. Okay. How does it look? Amazing! You should trim your beard a bit. Yeah? Hmm. Okay. Chitra, stop! It’s okay. I’ll pay. No big deal. I said I’ll pay. This is my gift. Come. At least let me collect it. Excuse me. I had to risk a lot to loan you 20 lakhs last time. Now you’re asking 30 lakhs on the same property. I know you can do it. You risked a lot to give me that loan last time. If you hadn’t done that, there’d be no movie now. Don’t blackmail me emotionally. How do I convince my boss now? Issak, I couldn’t give the money in time back then. I won’t let that happen this time. Here. Take it. Paid in full. Happy? Check once. Yes. Yes. I’ve already transferred the advance to your agency. Okay, great. Screening theatre, dinner venue and hotel booking… I’ll transfer the amount in 2 days. Don’t worry about it. Take your time. Get on the plane. Okay. Look. That imitation gold you bought me looks so good. Interestingly, they didn’t fade a bit. Issak, you might not get much on mortgaging these. Sell them. It’s totally fine. We can buy again. Why did you stop there? Come closer. It’s nothing, uncle. I remembered a scene that I couldn’t shoot for my film. You’ll have the chance again. That film is done, uncle. It’s okay. Don’t be disappointed. I wanted to see you before I leave tomorrow. I have the afternoon flight. I wanted to get you something, but… Just pray for me. You’re always in my prayers to Allah. Look, Issak… There might be people on Earth who are much more capable and smarter than you. But instead of all those smart people… Allah chose you to bestow his blessings. He must really love you and believe in you. Don’t let that opportunity go to waste. This is for you. Eat it on the flight. Bye, uncle.
