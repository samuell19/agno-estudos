Do not push please! Eh?! Hey you, what's wrong? Aren't you running? It's dangerous! Bo... bo... It's a bomb you know! What is it? It's just a rat. What about it? Because the rat's still here... ...it won't explode! That's stupid! Are you crazy?! Thief! Thief! What a weird bastard. NO GRAVE FOR US - If you like her, I'll let you marry her. - Uh, maybe next time. Oops... It's a revolver from my Okinawa route. I guarantee its quality. The registration numbers were erased. They aren't hot. I think they worth the money. Alright! Gathering all these tools... Are you gonna march into a bank or something? I ain't *Umekawa... [*Umekawa Akiyoshi (1948-1979) took 40 hostages in a bank robbery, killed 2 employees and 2 policemen. He was fatally shot 2 days later by the police] And I don't deal with amateurs. Thanks! - Keep it up with the good work! - Yeah. See ya! Lily-chan! BAR AJABA [Background song: Chameleon Army by Pink Lady] Listen up! Our next target is Tsuzuki Industries. That's just perfect! Tsuzuki Industries is just a facade. It's actually a bar managed by the Touka Group. This time I'll do it right, unlike the other day with the cash transporter when I got scared and got you in trouble. I'm different now, Touka Group's not a big deal. Breaking in and firing a few shots, it's a piece of cake. You're too naive! Even that time, if you hadn't have shat in the car, I wouldn't have been busted. - But "necessity knows no law" you know. - But isn't there something called *TPO?! [*TPO = time, place, occasion.] Listen up! Even them, they're being mobsters with their lives on the line. Do you think they'd obediently surrender in front of a shotgun and open the safe saying "Go ahead, help yourselves"? We at least need to learn how to open the safe, otherwise it would be impolite towards the other side, right!? - You're right. - Good. Is the shop open? I'm sorry, we're closed! - Oh... really? - Yeah. Come back some other time! What's wrong big bro? - Do you know her? - No. - It looks you know her. - I'm not like you. - If you're closed, at least turn off the signboard! - You're right. TSUZUKI INDUSTRIES Do you see the safe on the 3rd floor? Yeah. I've heard about it in jail, but... Inside that safe they keep a cash pool of around 20 million. I've been eyeing it for three months. Just because it's Touka Group's safe, everybody's too scared to make a move. Well, I think that'll become their weak point. You can barely see the dial from here. I'm gonna check it out a little more, you go and look for a car! Okay. - Let's go! - Okay. Hey, young man... - Young man, wanna come in? - What? What? What? What the heck is your problem? What are you doing? That's rude! A monster huh? [Background song: HERO (The Time to Become a Hero is Now) by Kai Band] Hiko! Hiko! He's surprisingly acting like a man today. Alright... Don't you feel it? Try to loosen up your tights. This is quite a bad position. I'm hitting the pelvis and it hurts! Still nothing? Don't you feel it? Huh? What the heck is wrong? This is bad. It's no good. Still no good? Answer me! This is frustrating. Shit! The bastard went all the way. - Hey you! - Big bro! - Wait a minute! - Wait a minute! You aren't wearing any panties! - Your "black cat" is showing! - What happened with the ¥873,000? - Talk after wearing something... - Let go of me! - What's the matter? - Hey what happen with them? - Give it back! Give it back! - What's that black thing? - Give back the ¥873,000! - Put on some pants! You too, stop dangling it! - Wait up! - You also, put on some pants. - Wear something first... - Put that small thing away. How the heck did you guys met, huh? I'm telling you... As I said... She passed out in front of the shop. - I just couldn't leave her alone. - That's just your usual MO. So... I was kindly looking after her. Since she's got quite a nice ass, I couldn't help myself. Thanks for the treat! I got fired. The ¥873,000... - It was decided that I stole them. - That's not possible! Because I took them. I had bad luck. Since I was the only one that didn't ran away and stayed at the counter. You should've ran away! Then come with me to the police and confess that you stole them! Stop joking! I'm not joking. Do you have any idea what I've been through? They took off my clothes. I've been striped... ...and then frisked. - And after all that you took off her clothes again! - And you're glorifying yourself again! And to top that off, they gave me the boot. Do department stores fire you that easily? They're demons, right?! - They're dispatch clerks. - Is that so?! And when I finally got a job at the department store... But once you loose a large amount over 800,000... - Even you guys realize what happens next, right?! - Yes we do! We know that. I'm sorry, forgive me. If you feel bad about it, give the money back! But I don't have it. I've already spent it. That's awful! Give the money back! If you can't give it back come with me to the police! I don't get along with the police! Are you okay? Violence is wrong! She might snitch to the cops. What are you going to do? I'll leave it to you. - Isn't this your specialty? - Not again... Where are you going? - Just out for a bit. - Out where? - Just let me be! - I'm coming too! You just fondle her, since you haven't been with a woman in a long time. Not again... This guy is really hopeless. Hey, are you okay? That girl's called Kawamura Michi. Although she went only to junior high, she poses that she went to junior college. And thanks to that incident she got exposed and suspected even more. Last night, she cried and rampaged all night long. Just look at this! Whoa! She was loud so I gave her some meth and threw her on the 2nd floor. You're still doing meth? Aren't you on probation right now? Sometimes my veins ache for it. You should place the car around there. With the front facing this way. That's just one-way, if the cops catch us we'll get some penalty points. But you don't even have a licence. Ah! No problem then. That guy again... We'd better hurry this up. - Hiko... - What? - We're doing it today. - Got it! You got it, right? - Just stick to the plan! - Uh-huh! And also... - Try not to use this unless you have to. - Uh-huh, uh-huh! Uh-huh. - Got it? - Uh-huh, uh-huh! Uh-huh. - Let's go! - Uh-huh. Go after him! Hey! Shit! Get him! - Shit! - Hey! You son of a bitch! - Shit! - Here, here, over here! Hurry! - Hurry up! - That bastard! Drive! - What's wrong? - What now?! - Hey! Let's go! - Okay. What's the matter? What's wrong with this car?! Watch out you idiot! What the heck are you doing? - Go that way! - Okay. You son of a bitch! You bastard! Ouch, that hurt. Hey, wait up! Hey! You damn brat! Oh?! You son of a bitch! What's wrong? Don't worry! Don't worry! Don't worry! Okay, I got it! We'll split the money. That'll do the job, right? Hey, what's wrong? 20 million... ...got washed down the river. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... It's almost like in *"Bancho Sarayashiki". [*aka "The story of Okiku" in which Okiku kept counting a set of plates in search for a 10th plate that was hidden by her lord] What's so funny? Hey... - Wanna team up with me? - Now just hold on a minute! - We don't even know each other's name. - Who cares about that?! When we fought I felt like... we bonded. Well... you're strong! It's been a while since I met someone like you. But I'm no match for you. As a matter of fact, I have a job on hold that's too risky to do alone, but together we'd make a great combo. What do you say? "Combo", huh!? Make that a trio! My partner's being chased in your place. If he gets caught... rescuing him comes first. You've got a strong sense of duty brother. That's disgusting! Welcome! Oh, it's just you! What's going on in here? Welcome, have a good time! [Background song: Zipangu by Pink Lady] Since I was a lonely, I thought of opening the shop... and it got full. Did Hiko call? What's the matter... with Hiko? Nothing really. Hey! This isn't your first time doing meth, isn't it?! I went astray since my 3rd year of junior high. After I got kicked out of school for teen prostitution. I've heard that you and Hiko know each other from reform school. I guess so. I was in for assault and injury, him, for violating the Narcotics Control Law. - Just the right match. - No shit, it's too well-made. Ah. - About that rat... - Huh? You know, the one under the cash register. Ah! Does it live there? Uh-huh, yes he does. He's a smart one. He eats only silk dresses of hundreds of thousands. But never eats the cheap ones. I somehow got fond of him... And sometimes I left him some cheese. You find this amusing, don't you? Not even a bit. We are too similar. So hanging out in some fancy place fits us perfectly. [The girls in the posters are "Pink Lady"] Don't act playful on me after some meth. Wasn't Hiko your partner? You've got a phone call! Hey you! It's someone called Takita. Hey, do you hear me? Answer me! I'm gonna bring it up right now. I made some rice. It's me. I found out your partner's whereabouts. - Where is he? - Wanna go there right now? - Yeah. - Alright, just wait a moment. I'm gonna pick you up right away. That's a pigsty run by the Touka Group. Gimme some food... Food... Gimme some food... I'm hungry... Gimme some food... Gimme some food... Hey! Not there, it's over here! - Over here, come here! That's right! - Gimme some food... Hey! Eat that shit up! Stuff yourself up! - Here's your food! - I'm hungry... Eat up! Hey, stop sniffing it! Wait a minute brother! It's not like he's gonna get killed right away, so leave this to me. Just hop in! Okay? - Wake up pig! - Stop fucking around! Don't you dare to sleep when the pigs are awake! - Wake up! - Wake up I said! - Hey! Hey! - Let me hear you oink! Hey! What are you doing? I told you to wake up? - Wake up! - What's wrong? Oink! Come on, oink! - Geez... let's just do him! - Let's fucking kill him! - Hey, let's have a smoke. - Okay. - What the hell is this? - Yeah, no one came to get him. Hey! I'm going to take a piss. We should mess him up some more! This pissess me off! Hey, we caught the wrong one! Shit! Don't move! Hand over the key! Hand me the key! I saw you took good care of my buddy! Thanks a lot! This is to express my gratitude. Throw it away! Hurry up! You idiot, throw it outside! If you make a funny move I'll blow this fucker's brains out! - What did you say?! - Shut up! - Stop dawdling! - Hurry up man! Hey! Stop right there you son of a bitch! Kill him... Kill that bastard! Fucking kill him! He got crushed... Now you're flat like a frog, you son of a bitch! Hey Hiko, what's wrong? Hiko! Hiko! Big bro, there's another guy that needs to be killed. The bastard who got ahead of us and snatched the money. If it weren't for that bastard, I... Damn it... I'm gonna fucking kill him! Kill him! I'm gonna fucking kill him! I'm gonna fucking kill him! Heave-ho! Okay, that's it. It stinks! It still stinks. Human food is delicious! This kinda stinks... That's... roast pork. "Roast pork"? - Pork, you mean pig? - Uh-huh, pig, smoked pig. Not again... I'm serious. I feel sick. Huh? Hey brother... That kid says that he's gonna kill me. I won't team up with such a guy. - I'll convince him... - That's no good! I'm not gonna thread on thin ice. Brother... You must understand that since you've done some pro jobs, right?! I've told you that if I team up with you, we'd make a great combo, didn't I?! I got it. So, what's our target? Well... There's this "Southeast Asian Gambling Tour". It's managed by the Touka Group. Among their clients are: company presidents, theater owners, land speculators, doctors and guys like that. It's 2 million per head, and there are roughly 30 people. 60 million, huh? That's not a bad job. What happened? Open the door! Open up! Hurry up! Sit down. Sit down! Listen up! If you make a scene, I'm gonna kill you! Hand over your money! Get all your money out! Hand over your money pops. Put them in here. You too. Hand it over. - Stop wasting our time! - That's right, you fools! Hey, don't drop it. Hey! Aren't you a little short, huh? Get it all out! What are you thinking? Don't fuck with me! Sit down! Drop it! Takita, crouch! Crouch! Shit... Thanks a lot! Hey! Get the car moving! Hey! Get out your money! Get it all out! They must've noticed. Hey. - Speed up! -Yes. Stop! Go! Go! Get in, Takita! - Is it your car? - That's right! Give it to me! Okay? - Just take this instead! - I'll take this too. Are you idiot?! Wait! - What's the matter? - Car thief! After him! Hurry up! Hurry! Thief! Thief! The gray car ahead, pull over. The gray car ahead, pull over! We did it brother! - We make a great combo. - That's for sure. Like we're gonna let you catch us, morons! You get off here. What about you? I'll break through the cordon by myself. It'll be easier alone than together. Then... Is it okay for me to take the money? You're a real man. I trust you. Here's my passport. What's this supposed to mean? Now that they saw my face, I can no longer stay in Japan. So... this is my lifeline. - Take it with you. - I don't need it. I'll leave it with you. - Pull over! - Stop! Pull over! - Hey, wait up! - Stop! Hey, pull over! Stop! - Thank you for the meal! - Thanks for the meal! - That was delicious! - Yeah! - Did you take everything? - Uh-huh! - Alright, let's go! - Take this! Okay. - What about this? - I'll carry it. - Hey, I want to go towards the sea! - Wait a minute then. Wanna go along this coastline? - It's a cycling course. - Really!? Then let's go there. - This way? Or is this better? - Then let's take that way. - Okay. - Okay, then... - Good day, lad and missy! - Hello there! Lend me your cap! Hurry up! Get on! Come on. You tell her! You'd better do as he says... You're coming with us lad! If you try anything, I'll rape her! Got that?! Uh-huh... Shall we go?! Headquarters directive for prefectural police No.208... No.208... Stop crying! - Why are you refusing today? - Get away from me... - Let's do it! - I said no! Let's do it! You slept with big bro, and now you're sick of me, right? You're wrong! But you're acting strange! Get away from me! And yet you were so delighted when we slept the other day. I was never delighted! I was just desperate that any man would've been fine! Don't be so full of yourself! You've slept with big bro in this room while I've been turned into a pig, right?! You bitch! - Let's do it! - No... You took good care of me at the pigsty you son... of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Get up you son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Fuck you, you son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!! You son of a bitch! - Have mercy please! - "Mercy" my ass, you son of a bitch! - Why are you doing this? - You idiot! You son of a bitch! You said "A pig is better than you", didn't you?! Stand up, you son of a bitch! I'll fucking kill you, bastard! You son of a bitch! Get up! - You came looking for me, didn't you? - You're wrong! You're wrong! The one I'm looking for is not you, it's Takita! "Not you" my ass! Who is this Takita bastard? It's a mustached bastard that wears a red polo shirt. The bastard that was growing bald? That bastard attacked our tour bus! The bar office too, wearing a mask. It's definitely him! The bastard wearing the same mask as me? As I was saying... The whole gang spread out looking for him in places he might frequent. The gang has no issues with you anymore! "No issues" my ass, you son of a bitch! Come here! I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch! Bar AJABA here! It's me, Takita. Is Shima back? - Weren't you together? - We had to split up. If Shima comes back, tell him that I'll call again. Okay, I'll tell him that. Come here! Get over here, you son of a bitch! How's Hiko? - Hiko's fine. - I see. Give me a drink! Just give me the bottle. Hey... Shouldn't you be sleeping? That Takita guy called. So... "I'll call again", he said. You've attacked a gambling tour, huh? Did Takita say that? I've squeezed that out of a Touka Group punk. So you had your eyes set on a nice gambling tour job! You've found yourself a good partner, right? That Takita must be a way more reliable man than me, right big bro? I've excluded you because you're in a bad shape, so don't get sulky! You gotta be shitting me! Who the hell do you think you're talking to, huh?! - Hello? - Is it Shima? Yeah! It's me. Hey, managing to break through that checkpoint... just as expected! - And where are you right now? - You see... I'm in Shimizu, Shizuoka Prefecture. Since it's too risky by airplane, I'll leave tomorrow via boat. Therefore, I wanna split the loot until tonight. Got it. So my location is: Bar KING on 2nd Street in the port district. Wait a second. - Go ahead. - Phone number: 0543- - 0543... - 51- - 51... - 51 - 51... - 58. 58. Got it. -I'll be there right away. - Come quickly. Hello... Hello? Shima! - What's wrong? - It's nothing. Big bro just headed that way. Don't worry about it. Since you're out after 3 years. Don't mind it. Stay here... I'll answer it. Is Takita here? Uh-huh... Tell him "Your friend is here"! Dear... Your friend came to see you! Okay! What are you doing? Takita! What do you think you're doing, brat? Don't underestimate me! You son of a bitch... - Just try and shoot! Shoot! - No! No! No! No! No... Don't move! You scared the shit out of me! Dear! Dear... Hey... Did Shima put you up to this? Did he?! Uh-huh... Uh-huh, uh-huh. Idiot! Heave-ho! - No! No! - You scared the shit out of me! What's wrong with you? Dear! Come quickly! You son of a bitch! Hey! Show yourself! How dare you set me up? You planned to let that brat do me... and keep all the money for yourself! I won't let you do that! You're wrong! It's a misunderstanding! "Misunderstanding"? Misunderstanding my ass! You can't fool me with a trick like that! That shinny head bastard... Shima, show yourself! Shima, show yourself already! I'll fucking kill you! Now that's come to this, I'm gonna fucking kill every single one of you! Shima! Stop hiding and show yourself! Shima! Did your ears fall off? Show yourself! What are doing with that bag?! Hey! Thief! Thief! Thief! That *pink tush girl... [*Allusion to her role in Pink Tush Girl (1978)] Stop following me! Even if you say that, I've got nowhere else to go. - Let me! - I'm okay. First and foremost, you always rely on me when you're in a tight spot. You didn't progress at all since our biker gang days. And I thought you became a little wiser while I was in jail... But you didn't change at all. Neither your mug nor your brains. And even your habit of attacking people from behind. - Are you a transvestite? - I'm no transvestite, I'm a man. - With that face? - Uh-huh... - Huh?! - Stop following me! Got that? I'll kill you one day! Big bro! ...the burning cafe, restaurant and other shops were extinguished around 6 o'clock. According to the Shibuya fire department investigation... My bad! Due to living with pigs, even my way of thinking turned pig-like. I misunderstood you. - I'm sorry! Forgive me! - No! I don't wanna live with you anymore. - That's cold! - ...at a bar in Shimizu City, there was an incident where a man was shot with a gun. The victim, Takita Eiichi, 36 years old, unemployed and with no fixed abode, has been admitted at the local hospital, but his life is not in danger. So he didn't die. - What if he snitches on us to the cops? - Fool, he's not like you. I wonder? How much? ¥360 for both. - I have a ¥10,000 bill, so get the change ready. - Yes. Hey. Mister! Mister! Hey, they're bilking! Who's your accomplice? We've got the statement of an eye-witness so... remaining silent is unacceptable! You were waiting for your friend in order to flee abroad from Shimizu. That's what KING's matron testified. The shootout was an internal discord, right? What's the reason for the internal discord? Hey! Takita! Say something! I'll kill you! "I'll kill you!"? Who are you going to kill, huh? - Don't underestimate the Police! - Hey, you mustn't! Doing that might kill him. Stubborn bastard! It's micturition time. Black car... ...tonight at 8:00... ...waiting at the entrance. Hey. - Chair. - Yes Sir. Takita... - It's me... - Here you go! Tsuzuki. Don't worry, I'm not going to kill you here right now. What do you... want from me? Money... I want to ask you about the 60 million that you stole. Dunno! I know nothing! Hey... You don't know?! The money are connected with AJABA's manager and with this other man, right? You're wrong. What?! It's a woman. Huh? A woman called Michi. "Michi"? And what kind of woman is this Michi? A drug addict. Looking for her like a fool that knows nothing else... Is there a point in doing that? Since the Touka Group lot are looking for us, we can't really do anything. My body will grow dull in this narrow place. Perhaps Michi already flew to America? She's not such a clever woman. Ooh... I see you're pretty confident. Isn't it because she ain't clever that she got involved with a hopeless guy like you? That's harsh... - I'm going out a bit. - Where are you going? You just wait here. How about this one? It goes like this. Don't you have something more amazing that goes like this? "More amazing"? Huh?! Wait a minute! The authorities are really pestering you know! Well... hmm... That bastard! Ah, this is it. Huh?! Hands up! Put them on your head! Put them on your head! Die! You son of a bitch... Stop it! Stop it! Stop... - You son of a bitch! - Stop it! Stop it! Eek! Murderer! Michi, why you... Are you awake? Yeah... Michi... Why you... You're pretty tough. Your heart should've stopped after loosing that much blood. I'm type AB just like you. So I gave you my blood. It took some money to call for a tight-lipped doctor you know. You gave me some trouble. Why did you help me? Shima Katsuo, wanted nation-wide. You can't get out of here. The Touka Group is desperately looking everywhere for you as well. Where's my gun? - Who is it? - We're from Petit Jewel. Wait a minute! - Thanks for choosing us! - We've come to deliver the goods. Here you go! Yes. Count it! It's correct. We'll be leaving then. Thank you! "Kawamura Michi" huh... That was the Touka Group, right? I'm buying meth from the Touka Group. Huh?! Where's the money? Tell me! Do you wanna die? Where's the money? Just kill me! I won't give you the money... because you'll leave me. I won't give it even if it kills me! Really? Yes Sir. - Are you sure she's called Michi? - Yes, Kawamura Michi. First of all, it's unusual that she's a drug addict while living in such luxury. - I hope she's no bait? - No, she's on a different financial scale. - Check her out! - Yes Sir. Show her to Takita. ROYAL MANSION - That's Kawamura Michi. - Are you sure? Yes. So? It's not her. It wasn't that kind of woman. Is that so? Drive! Yes. Wait! Wait up! Wait! Hey stop the car! Get out of my way! Takita! Hurry up! - Takita! - Hey! What the hell are you doing?! Get him! Where the hell did he go? Hey! What the hell is this? Stomach medicine? It's just a rubber! This doesn't even make up for my effort! I'm keeping it. Hey. Hey wait up! I'm coming with you too. Since I wanna fully pay you back for the Shimizu thing. Get on! Come on! Stop! Who is it? It's the manager. Where's the money? I said, where's the money? Hey! Hey. Give me the money! If you don't, I'll fucking kill you! Where is it? Takita! Why you... Shima... How dare you back-stab me... Shima... How... dare you... The Touka Group... spotted this place... We... can't run away anymore... Big bro! You left me stuck in a narrow pigsty-like place and went to have a good time by yourself? I can't forgive you! So what are going to do? I'll pop you! Bring it on! I knew that one day I'll have to settle the score with you. Seeing... your eyes... disturbed... my aim... I should've... popped you from behind! Hiko! Hiko! Give me the money! Give me the money. Give me the money or I'll fucking kill you! If you kill me... you'll never get the money! Don't take me lightly, you bitch! The moment I give up on the money... you die. Remember that! - How is it? - The same. - TOP PORNO here. - It's Shima. Oh, it's you! - Do you have some caliber 45 or 38 bullets? - Hmm... I don't have any right now. - Then, do you have some dynamite? - Yes I have. And, can you also bring a *Dutch wife? [*sex doll] Hey! Huh? It's Nakai! Hey, that was fast! You know... she said that she can't wait any longer for you to embrace her. - The dynamite is inside. - Thanks a lot man! No need to count it. Don't worry it's all in there. Treat her gently, - because she's still a virgin. - Okay, I got it! - Keep up the good work! - Yeah! President, what's wrong? The Giants lost tonight's game, so I'm pissed off! - By the way, how's the situation? - Well... Still no sign of movement. Isn't it about time to get them out? - Then, shall we go?! - Yes Sir. - What's with that doll? - What the heck is that? - Hey! That's dynamite! - Put it out! Put it out! Shit... Get out! Get out! Get out! Hurry up! Hey... Let's go! Hurry up! - Where are you going? - I have no idea. Can I come with you? I can't just leave a drug addict like you alone, right? Can you... - promise that you won't abandon me? - You're annoying! The money... - are here. - Where? Inside that? Yeah... Get out! Good-bye! Take care! You liar! Eh?! You've got the devil's luck. I'm done... I can't go on! Who the hell told you to race with the car? Fool! It's gone, it's gone, it's gone... This? No... Thief! That precious... what am I going to do? No... Give it back, give it... Give it back! If you quit meth, I'll take you with me! - Thief! - You're a nuisance!
