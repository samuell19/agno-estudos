(peaceful choral music in foreign language) (shouts in foreign language) - [Man] Oh, you're on Candid Camera! (laughs) - You can't let them pass us, Moses. - We are going as fast as we can, miss! - I think we should just slow down and enjoy the scenery. - I think that's an excellent idea. - They always seem to end up overtaking us. - It's not a competition. - Moses I'll give you 10 shillings if you can stay in front. - Thank you, Charles. - I'll make that 20, just to be a good uncle. - I don't go any faster, them working boys fix the engine. - He's such a stupid show-off! - Most young men are, my dear. Particularly when they're trying to make a good impression. - Woo! - All right, Kidogi! - [Man] Very good! - Man, find some decent gas, you got this thing airborne. Let's try a big one, Kiru. - What have you got for us today, Kidogi? - [Kidogi] Baby elephant. (peaceful percussive music) (shouts in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (elephant trumpets) (speaks foreign language) (gun fires) (elephant trumpets) (guns fire) (shouts in foreign language) (chatter in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (shouts in foreign language) (elephant growls) (elephant roars) (elephant roars) - Game wardens! - What's going on? - Looks like the poachers. (shouts in foreign language) - What are they saying? - Poachers. They come out in the desert and kill the elephants. These are the second group they've caught this week. - [Woman] Where do they come from, Moses? - Many days from here, miss. - [Woman] Well, I certainly hope they put them away for a long time. - It won't do any good. This is how they survive, it's the only thing they know. - This is absolutely delicious. - [Man] Would you give all this up and come and live with us in England, Moses? - [Moses] England is too cold. - [Woman] Well, how about California? - Baseball, rock and roll. - All right! - Did you see anything, guys? Yeah, right. - How many kids do you have, Kidogi? - Nine boys. - Nine boys, huh? - That's the rhythm out here for ya. - Someone should buy him a television set. - That really is too many, Kidogi. - I'm lucky, they look after me when I'm old. - [Woman] They'll make you old, believe me. - In another 20 years time, all this will be irrigated farm land. They'll talk about the elephants like they talk about the bison, the passenger pigeon. - [Woman] What a depressing thought. - [Man] Well, no man is an island to himself these days. - That's not even amusing. - I think it's great, a real Kodak moment. - Taking pictures of people when they don't want it is an invasion of their privacy. - Just bop him on the head if he annoys you, honey. (group laughs) (speaks foreign language) - Does it say how to order champagne? - You want some? - Yes. - Hey, Kidogi! (speaks foreign language) (shouts in foreign language) - [Woman] It's an elephant! - [Boy] Look, Mom, there's a whole bunch of them! - [Woman] Little babies. (shouts in foreign language) - Do you see him, the old tall one is Elgopa. - [Woman] He's beautiful. - He's the last of the great elephants. Last of the big tuskers, we are very lucky to see him. - He must be over 100. - He is the dream of all the poachers. They say his tusks are worth more than $800,000. (suspenseful music) - He's protected, isn't he? - He's so smart. Knows what people are thinking. - Well, he's just scented us. - But he already knows we are here. (elephant growls) - He's certainly paying us a lot of attention. - Probably Moses's cooking. (speaks foreign language) - What is it, Moses? - He knows we're just tourists. Something else is killing him. (elephant trumpets) - Over there, you see, it looks like men and camels. - [Man] A bunch of them. (chatter in foreign language) - We have to leave this place. - What's the matter? - We need to go, we need to go. - [Moses] They are poachers, very bad people. - [Woman] Michael, Michael, hurry up! - George. - I could write a novel. - [Woman] Michael! (gun fires) (groans) (gun fires) (screams) - God. (chatter in foreign language) - They killed Kidogi. (shouts in foreign language) - Tell him we're just tourists. If he wants to take anything, tell him it's okay. (poachers shout in foreign language) - He said all the men must get in the box. (poachers shout in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (speaks foreign language) - No, she's not going, you're not taking her! She's not going, you're not taking her! (speaks foreign language) Where are they taking them? - He said we must go to the government. These people will be free when their own people get back to the village. - I feel the bone slightly other side. - [Woman] Try to keep it clean so it doesn't get infected. (speaks foreign language) (moody music) (engine stalls) (chatter in foreign language) (engine stalls) - The car needs petrol. - Huh? - Petrol, petrol. The car needs to drink. - Oh, oh! (speaks foreign language) - Think they'll find the spare tank? (speaks foreign language) - How far have we gone? - 70 miles. - Everyone okay? - I have to go to the bathroom. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Yes, the lady needs to, um... Pee pee. - Eh? - Psst, psst. Tinkle tinkle. - I think you'll have to draw them a picture. - She needs to tinkle, wee wee. - Wee wee? - To go to the loo. Wee wee. - Wee wee? - Jesus Christ, wee wee. - Wee wee? - Tinkle tinkle. Wee wee, psst, psst. - Oh! (chuckles) (speaks foreign language) - Jesus, this is bloody ridiculous. - Damn it. - He just keeps staring at me. - Don't look at him. Come on, come on. Don't you push me! (speaks foreign language) - You're gonna get us all killed, man. (chatter in foreign language) (moody music) (speaks foreign language) - Don't touch it, leave it alone. (speaks foreign language) Don't do it. (speaks foreign language) We don't have to do everything they tell us. - Just do as he says, Liz. (speaks foreign language) (suspenseful music) (plane engine hums) (shouts in foreign language) (speaks foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (cows moo) (suspenseful music) (shouts in foreign language) - Speak English? - Yes. - I speak English. - Look, we don't know anything about your people or government. This is all a mistake, we're not even from here. - Good morning, good evening, have a nice day. Good morning, good evening, have a nice day. (speaks foreign language) - What's going on? - She wants me to stay with her. - Oh no, you're going with us, she's coming with us. (speaks foreign language) She's coming with us. (shouts in foreign language) - It's okay, it's okay, I'll be all right. (speaks foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (rhythmic clapping) - What do you think they're gonna do, if they don't get what they want? - They're not gonna do anything. They're more frightened than we are. - [Charles] Oh yes, you should try telling Kidogi that. - I'm sure the government's gonna get us out of this. - Don't bet on it. Bastard, see where he touched. - Charles. Relax. (suspenseful music) (thud) - Wake up. Wake up! - What? - He just hit him. - What the hell are you doing? - He's dead. - Dead? - See if we can get some water. - Are you crazy? - Shh! - You think we can get up and walk outta here? They're gonna kill us all! - I'm gonna get the girl. - You know how to use this? Let's get the hell out of here. (Kiru speaks foreign language) - He's killed the guard. We must go, come on. - [Moses] Shh, water. (dog barks) (speaks foreign language) (gun fires) (shouts in foreign language) (thud) (shouts in foreign language) - Michael, come on, Michael, run! (moody music) - Anything? - No. How're you doing? We should keep going till it gets hot. The further south we go, the sooner we'll find water. - Do you think the others made it? - They had as good a chance as we did. You've gotta stop thinking about it, Michael. Whatever happened back there wasn't our fault. They started it, and for what it's worth, what you did was an accident. - That makes a difference? - Yes, it does. You saw what they did to Kidogi. Maybe you should think about that for a while. (suspenseful music) (snake hisses) - No, no, no, no! (gun fires) - Jesus, Michael, those are the only bullets we have! - Did it get you? - I can't believe this. - Let me see. - Oh god, oh god. - Doesn't look too bad. - Too bad? It's poison, I'm, oh god. - Give me your belt. - I can't believe this. - [Charles] Come on, Michael, come on! - No, it's supposed to go above the knee. - For Christ sake, man! - I gotta get the poison out! - [Charles] Give it to me. - How long before I die? - We don't even know that it's poisonous. - [Michael] I didn't see it, I didn't see it. - There's no way of telling what the bloody hell it is now. (moody music) - I knew something like this was gonna happen. I just knew it. - How does it feel now? - The same. - I don't think it's poisonous. I've seen snakes bite things on TV and they die immediately. - Well, thank you. - It hasn't swollen, it's not even red. - Let's try untying the tourniquet and see what happens. - We can't just keep sitting here. - [Michael] Screw you. - We have to do something, Michael. What is it? - It's like pins and needles. - That's probably just the blood going back into your leg. - Can you move it? - I guess it's okay. - You got lucky, let's get going. - I'm so sorry I slowed you down. Is it me or do you just hate all Americans? - My father was an American. (moody music) (shouting in foreign language) (speaks foreign language) (shouts in foreign language) (dark orchestral music) - Looks like a kill, keep your eyes open. (lion growls) Get out of here! - No! (lion roars) (screams) (Charles screams) Help him, Michael, help him! No! Do something to help him! Stop it! Stop! (lion snarls) Stop it! Come on, help me! - Come on, come on! (shouts in foreign language) (suspenseful music) Look, there's a lot more animals out here, and we're gonna find some water in the morning. Did you hear me? I'm talkin' to you! Been talking to you for hours now. - Stop it, just stop it! What did you say? - You haven't heard a thing I've said since it happened, have you? - Look, I'm not blaming you, I just don't wanna think about it anymore. I just wanna go to sleep, I just wanna sleep. - We have to talk about it. Look, Elizabeth, we have to keep the faith. - Faith? You think there's a god out here? Hope, mercy? Look at us, there's nothing! We're just animals living off other animals, until something kills us. That's all we are. That's actually all we've ever been. Everything else we've just invented. - Well, I still believe. (moody orchestral music) (lion growls) (shouts in foreign language) (flies buzz) Leave us alone! Get out of here! Get outta here! Leave me alone! Wake up. Wake up. (suspenseful music) Wake up. Wake up, wake up. Do you see him? (peaceful orchestral music) Let's see if he knows where the water is. I knew somethin' like this was gonna happen, I just knew it. (moody orchestral music) - Trees. - Come on. (elephant growls) Wait here. He's digging for water. Come on. (Elizabeth laughs) (elephant growls) - He just smelled us. (elephant growls) - It's not us. He knows we're here. - No one could've followed us, it's not possible. It's not possible. (suspenseful music) - Tastes okay. Slowly, all right? Slowly, eat slowly. - I didn't mean what I said yesterday. About not believing, not having faith. I was just angry. - I'd say it's better to get off your chest. - Well, it's not exactly the most trite. - Yeah, I've noticed that. - What, you of course always say exactly what you think? - Most of the time, yes. (both chuckle) What, you don't believe me? - No, I don't. - Well, from now I'll tell you everything. - I don't want to know everything. I've already suffered enough from your feelings. - And what is that supposed to mean? Why are you so damn nasty? - Nasty? You're the one who's being nasty. Just because I wouldn't go out to dinner with you, you've gone out of your way to make my life hell. 10 days of your camera in my face, endless stupid retorts, lizards in my shoes, stupid scary noises in the middle of the night. - I don't believe I'm sitting out here dying and you're bringing this up. - Well, as you said, it's best to get things off your chest. Isn't that right? (distant clattering) - Come on, come on. (clattering) It's a plane. - What is he doing? - I don't know. (elephant roars) (suspenseful music) - What're you doing? - Trying to make a wind sail. He's gone. He left in the night, the tracks lead out there. - I'm not leaving here. - We don't have any alternative. - I'm not leaving the water. - They didn't find the plane, they're not gonna find us. - Maybe the pilot made it. - No, he didn't. I found this in the tree. The plane's flight book, he used it as a diary. You should read it to me. - "Day 96. "Not a cloud, not a sound. (moody orchestral music) "Not even an insect. "Just my breathing in the trees. "Farewell, you gentle giants. "Maybe I'll see you again in another life. "I'm glad it's over. "Harry Barten, 1942 to 1975." - Let's see if you can put some water in the can. - Don't you think we could at least have a vote on it? - Look, he didn't see anyone in 96 days. Just an old elephant, which he wished he would've followed. (suspenseful music) - I'm telling you, it's not gonna work! (dramatic music) How did you learn how to do this? - Wind surfing. - (laughs) I think it's incredible, you're a genius. We can sail all the way back to England. - So, what part of America's your father from? - Philadelphia. - Philly girl, huh? - (chuckles) Yeah. - You wanna take it? - No! I wouldn't even know which way to go. - Just follow his tracks to get to Kilimanjaro safely. (screams) (bright orchestral music) - (laughs) This is fantastic. What happened? - Falling asleep. I need you to take over for a while. - I'm sorry, how long have I been sleeping? - Couple of days. - I feel like I've been sleeping for days. - Just keep the sun at that angle and you're going south. I lost his tracks a couple hours back. Will you be okay? - Mm-hm. - Wake me if there's a problem. - Michael? Thank you for getting us out of that place. I'd have just stayed forever. - You'd have gotten bored in a couple days and walked off. - I wish I were that tough. - Toughest girl I ever met. - If you mean that as a compliment, thank you. If you're referring to our personal relationship, you're right, my father always said I judged the world before they had time to blossom. - So, I'm a flower now? - A thistle, maybe. - Well, I think you're a rose, a very prickly one. - I like that. - Oh, my god, it's a major breakthrough. We actually agreed on something. - I think you should get some sleep. - Goodnight, Rose. - Goodnight, Michael. (elephant roars) Michael! - Get down. Get down! (Elizabeth yelps) Are you okay? - Has he gone? - He's leaving. What is it? - He just knocked the wind out of me. They say you never notice your blood until it hurts. - [Michael] You're not bleeding, you missed it by an inch. - He definitely doesn't like airplanes. - [Michael] We're lucky to be alive. - [Elizabeth] Can you fix it? - Yeah, with a blowing torch. (suspenseful music) (bird squawks) There's another one. - They're like rockets! (chuckles) Good shot. Do you think they have feelings like we do? - Not anymore. There's another one. Damn. - I guess that's it. - We've got plenty anyway. (tense music) - Oh, my god. - [Michael] Crocodiles! - What are they doing? - I don't know! Come on, let's go, come on! Look out! (Elizabeth yelps) - You should've seen your face. - They scared the hell out of me. - You looked like a chicken at the beach. - There could've been big ones in there. - Well, I'm not going back to find out. (chuckles) (distant elephant roars) This is how our ancestors must have lived all the time. No wonder we're all so frightened and paranoid. - Why don't you try and get some sleep? I'll keep the fire going. - What about you? - I'll wake you when I get tired. - Look, I've already slept. Let me take the first watch, I'll be fine. - Are you sure? - Don't worry about it. - You better keep the fire going. - Damn right I'll keep it going. (distant elephant roars) - Don't worry, he won't come near the flames. - Well, if he does, I'm going to bash him between the eyes. - Oh, I feel totally safe. - Just go to sleep, okay? (moody orchestral music) (chuckles) Wake up. Wake up. Look. - [Michael] Why didn't you wake me? You've been up all night. - (chuckles) I fell asleep. - Thanks for keeping me alive. - You mean asleep. (suspenseful music) (guns fire) (elephant roars) No! (guns fire) Stop it, don't! (guns fire) (guns fire) (elephant trumpets) (distant guns fire) (elephant trumpets) (guns fire) (elephant roars) (tense orchestral music) (distant guns fire) - Are you okay? (chatter in foreign language) - They're coming. Oh, god. Poor little thing. - Come on. - What about him? - They won't touch a baby, they only want the tusks. (elephant trumpets) (chatter in foreign language) (elephant trumpets) - Go on, go! - No! Stop it, stop it! - We can't let him just keep following us. - What do you expect him to do? - Look, his mother could still be back there. - She wouldn't have left him, you know she's dead. He's only following us because he knows we won't hurt him. - Look, he's gonna be okay, all right? We're all gonna be okay. I'll make a camp and get us some food. (suspenseful music) (chatter in foreign language) (elephant growls) (elephant roars) (speaks foreign language) (screams) (elephant roars) (elephant trumpets) (moody percussive music) (hogs squeal) (yelps) Come on, move! Come on, beat it! Go. (ostrich hisses) Come on, big bird, please. Please move. Please. Please go. (ostrich hisses) I'm sorry! Oh my god, oh my god. Keep your egg, I don't want it! Leave me alone! - Come on, baby, come to me. Come here. Come on! Come on, come on. That's it, don't be frightened, it's okay. Come here. Come on. It's okay, come on. Don't be frightened, come to the land with me, come on. (elephant trumpets) No, please don't leave! Come back, please. (elephant trumpets) - Forget it, come on. (elephant trumpets) - He's not going to survive. - He's gonna be okay. What happened to the fire? - I couldn't light it. - Put this around you. You'll catch a cold. (elephant trumpets) - [Elizabeth] If anything happens to him, I'm just not gonna wanna live anymore. - [Michael] It's gonna be okay, we're all gonna be okay. Get your wet clothes off so you don't catch a cold. (speaks foreign language) (speaks foreign language) (peaceful music) - Good morning, I'm so glad to see you here. And looking so well. Come on back here, don't be frightened. We'll take good care of you. (elephant trumpets) That's a good baby. Good morning. Sunny side up, duck eggs from the river. - How did you light the fire? - Elementary, dear sir. Just the sun and the lens. Do you see him? He's been eating since I woke up, he's gonna be okay. - So, you still wanna live, huh? - Yes. I washed them in the river. They're dried in about 10 minutes. - Should sleep in more often, thank you. - See what you think. It's a fork, caveman variety. Go ahead. Mm! - Great. - It is, isn't it? I felt sorry for the ducks. I left them two eggs in the nest. (distant elephant trumpets) So. Who's Kelly? You talk in your sleep. - Well, she's an old girlfriend. - You mean she's 90 or something? - No, for a couple of years, off and on. - Off and on? - We had our differences. - And what are those? - Oh, she thinks I'm too possessive. I think she's less honest. - You think she's cheating on you? - [Michael] What happened to the girl who liked privacy? - Well, this is different, gossip doesn't count. - Gossip? - You were speculating about her cheating or not, and that becomes gossip, so, did she? - I think so. And you, do you have a boyfriend? - Several. - Several? - (chuckles) Two. (mumbles) - I can't believe this. - They did. - I didn't say anything. - You didn't have to. - You have two boyfriends. (elephant growls) - What's he doing? - Down. (elephant trumpets) (suspenseful music) - Oh, my god. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. (speaks foreign language) Maybe he's just hunting with the others. - No, he's looking for me. Come on. Come on, let's go. (birds squawk) (dramatic music) (speaks foreign language) (speaks foreign language) (speaks foreign language) (Elizabeth gasps) (dramatic music) - [Elizabeth] He must've been hiding here all the time. - Yeah, they wanna kill him just like they wanna kill me. Come on. - We should stay with the old elephant. He's the only one who knows how to keep us away from them. Shh. (elephant trumpets) (both laugh) Hey, I think he's starting to like us. - Should we introduce him to the old man? - Yeah, let's get as far away from here as we can. Come on, we're gonna introduce you to your old man! (peaceful orchestral music) Come on, baby! (elephant trumpets) (elephant trumpets) (elephant trumpets) (suspenseful music) (leopard snarls) (groans) (leopard snarls) Help me! Kill it! (Michael grunts) (Elizabeth and Michael grunt) Kill it! (speaks foreign language) (group laughs) (chatter in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (speaks foreign language) I felt like an animal out there today. I didn't know I could be like that, it was like something from my past, something primitive coming out of me. - You were hungry. - Yeah, I was starving. You want some more of this white meat? - No, thanks, you want some of this? - (laughs) I wish I had a camera right now. - What do you do in England? - Well, I was planning to go to the university that my father went to in America. - To be what? - An anthropologist. At least, that's what I was thinking. That's the reason we came here. My uncle thought it might help me make up my mind. They call this place the Cradle of Mankind. They think it's where man first evolved from the ape. - And you believe that? - Well, I think it's proven. - What about God? You don't think he'd anything to do with it? - Well, of course he did, I think he made even that happen. - You mean, the uh, apes, you mean? - It's not so bad, if you think about it. I've known a lot of interesting monkeys. - So, do you think it's still happening? - What? - Monkeys turning into men. - Well, I think the process may have reversed itself. - Let me have that. - What are you doing? (chuckles) A bed? - A feather bed. So, what do you think? - Oh, incredible. - Looks incredible. I wish I had my camera right now. - Come and look at the stars with me. - I would love to. Not bad. - This used to be the main entertainment, for those monkeys and early man. - I imagine there must have been a few other things. - I'm sure they did. - Well, I think it's actually been proven. - You do? Why is that? - Well, we wouldn't be here? - That's very good. I don't think he approves. (peaceful orchestral music) I'm not sure this is such a good idea. - (chuckles) Wanna watch TV instead? - It's not funny. - You don't have to do anything you don't want to. - And what if I want to? - Well, do you? - Even if the answer's yes, it doesn't mean I'm going to. - You're tough. - Toughest girl you'll ever meet. (grunts) (dramatic orchestral music) (speaks foreign language) Oh, my god, Michael, wake up! There's hundreds of them! - What? - Fleas! - Oh, god. (Elizabeth laughs) - They must be coming from the feathers! - I'm outta here. - I'm right behind you! Wait, what about the food? - You want it, you go get it. - [Elizabeth] Look out! Cute bum. (moody music) (elephant trumpets) (laughs) It feels incredible. - It looks incredible. - You better watch it, or else. - Or else what? - I'll bop you on your head like your mother. (elephant trumpets) (laughs) (chuckles) Look. They've got the same problem we've got. (chuckles) Did you hear that? It's a love song. - How do you know it's a love song? - 'Cause they only play pretty songs like that when they're courting, it excites the females. - Oh, really? - I'm serious! It's vibrations, it has the same effect on people. ♪ Feelings ♪ Not going to your head ♪ Feelings (Elizabeth laughs) ♪ Feelings, feelings, feelings (Elizabeth laughs) ♪ Not going to your head ♪ Feelings (elephant trumpets) - You're scaring the baby. Michael. - Elizabeth, get outta here. Get outta here. - [Elizabeth] You can't fight him, Michael! - Go! Get outta here! (speaks foreign language) - Leave us alone! (speaks foreign language) - It was an accident, I didn't mean to hurt your father. (shouts in foreign language) Go, now! Go! (shouts in foreign language) - No! Michael! (elephant trumpets) Leave him alone! No! Michael! (Michael groans) No! - Come on, you son of a bitch, come on! Come on! - Shit. - Come on, come on! Come on, come on! (groans) - Michael! (tense orchestral music) Run! Michael! Over there! (screams) (shouts in foreign language) (screams) (shouts in foreign language) (screams) Michael! - Stay back! (moody orchestral music) - [Elizabeth] Are you okay? - I just let him go. - He was going to kill you. Look what he did to you. - Do you wanna know something ridiculous? (chuckles) Mom won this trip on a game show. Some people win swimming pools, cars. We won a trip to this place. I just keep seeing his face, over and over. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life, just wishing I could've reached out. We don't belong here, this is not our place. - You didn't come here to hurt anyone. You have to forgive yourself. (moody music) (elephant trumpets) (elephant growls) - Wake up. Get back. (elephant growls) (elephant trumpets) (elephant trumpets) - They like each other. - Shh! (elephant growls) Pushing him away. He's protecting him, run! (elephant trumpets) Come on, faster! (elephant roars) (dramatic music) Keep going! (elephant trumpets) Quicker! Go! - Michael. (elephant growls) Keep still. (elephant growls) - I could smell his breath. - He was just protecting him, he thought we might hurt him. He knows we're not dangerous. - He looks happy. - Maybe it's his real dad. A mountain. - Come on. - [Elizabeth] We made it, there should be people out there. - Kilimanjaro. It's beautiful. (elephant trumpets) - A plane. - Come on. Hey, over here! - Over here! - Hey! - Down here! Do you think they saw us? - I don't know. It's coming back. - Over here! Down here! - Hey! - Hey! - [Michael] Hey! (elephants trumpet) - Over here! - It's coming back again. - Down here! - Hey! - Down here! What're they doing? (elephant roars) No! (gun fires) (elephant trumpets) No! Please stop it! No! No! Stop it, please stop it! Oh, god. No. - It's coming back, stay here. (elephant trumpets) - He's trying to pick him up. (elephant trumpets) How can they do this? How can they do this? Come on, baby. (elephant trumpets) Come on, baby. Come on, baby, come on. What's the matter with him? What's the matter? - He's trying to protect him. - How could they do this? How could they do this? (sobs) Oh, god. Oh, god. (moody orchestral music) (birds squawk) - They dropped a radio marker. They're gonna come back, you know. We're gonna have to leave him here. - I'm not going without him. - Look, if he doesn't wanna come with us, we can't make him. - We have to. - Okay, okay. I'll try and make him follow you, be calm. (elephant trumpets) Get outta here! Go, go on! Go, get outta here! - [Elizabeth] Come on, baby, just get outta here! - It's the only way to make him go, go on! - You don't have to be so rough, you're hurting him! - Get outta here! Go, go on, go! Get outta here! (elephant trumpets) Go, go on! Go on! (elephant trumpets) - [Elizabeth] Come back!
