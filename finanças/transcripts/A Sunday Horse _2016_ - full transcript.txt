INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY As a kid, I believed in miracles and the miraculous. But when I got older, faded my conviction. Water into wine became maja on a Saturday night. And if I had seen a burning bush, I had downloaded water hose. But even at that time I had my love for horses - - And a burning passion for riding. It kept my heart open to miracles. That one day I would hear it. Just as sweet as the wine at Cana. Just as bright as the burning bush. Lord's voice. And like a child again ... I would regain my faith. - I'm late! - You are not early either. And the manager would prefer that we come in early. - Move over, your cow. - It costs more than your parents' house. It probably costs more than three houses. Come again. Good boy. Okay. I've seen enough. Return the boom. - What do you think? - He's a tough guy. A little front-heavy. - If someone could shorten his steps ... - Now is the extra one expert. I try me on the doubles again. Of course, with shorter steps. FA igen. - I recognize you. - I doubt that. Yes I do. - Is not that the girl from Virginia Junior Championship? The girl who looked like the Michelin old man? You remember her ridiculous outfit? We laughed so hard that we almost fell out of our saddles. You know what I remember? I beat a lot of rich kids. But the funny thing is that I do not remember you. Ferment... If I decided I would fire you because you smoke at the stables. "Safety first". That's my motto. Are you some kind Ken doll? - Would imagine a compliment? - Just above the waist. Nothing? Nevermind. You are a bore. So will your boss to buy Peaches? Probably. The family Dumar has shown some interest. They will probably push up the price in the bidding against Bonnie. Bonnie? Is she your boss? My partner. Bonnie Brae, which owns Brae Valley Farms? It is not far from my home. Bonnie looking for a new stallion and your boy look promising. By the way, did you know who I was when you questioned my ability? Sorry, I'm not talking eye rolling. Excuse me. Fish for compliments? It is quite ridiculous. You know very well that everyone in the industry know who Jonathan Collier. But you are not a part of the industry, right? - You are a stole lapa, a suede square brownie. - I'm a rider. No. You were a rider when you won the Virginia Junior Championship. It was over four years ago, according to the always charming Miss Dumar - - Who really do not like you, and please tell it to others. Nowadays... ... Shoveling manure and you smoke when you are alone on the job. What funny. Is that what you think about me? Do you think some grass led to my deposition? They called me the Man from my riding clothes were too big. My parents could not afford new clothes every time I grew. So my mom bought larger sizes I had to grow into. Elysse Dumar and her friends thought it was funny, so I beat them. Okay? I do not ride anymore because I can not afford to pay for the horse. I'm not Elysse Dumar who receive money if she puckers her lips. My father's salary goes to huslånet, groceries and tires to the car. - Am I boring you? - A little, yes. If you had wanted to ride, you had found a solution. Instead shoveling manure to smoke on, and blame everything on your surroundings. What do you know about it? I know there are horses that you can buy. Not like this guy. Not horses for one hundred thousand US dollars. Horses who are poorly trained or even abused. Horses that cost a few thousand dollars and can be trained to racing form. But you have to stop tune your situation first. Do you understand what I'm saying? You need to stop wallowing in your misery - - And really search for them. Of course, it is provided that you have saved salary. Should I interpret that as a no? 63 lousy bucks. Debi! Stay! - They want to meet you at the equestrian course. - What? After yesterday, I would worry more for the "why" than the "what"? Come on! Hurry up! - Are you sure about this, Jonathan? - I need to see what he is capable of. But Jonathan, we have the most skilled riders. The girl can ride. - You said she could ride. Four years ago, on a horse that approached the tomb. And yet she defeated you. I want to see what she can do with a real horse. You wanted to see me, Mr Blue. - That's right ... excuse? - Debi. Of course, Debi. Mr Collier wanted to ask if we could ... One can learn a lot from watching someone else ride. I wish you could consider using one of our riders. He does not inspire confidence directly. You may be right, Monty. We should get a real horseman. I can handle it. I said, "I can handle it." Ferment? Are you sure? Okay. It is best not to take any risks, in spite of your thick skull. Need help, Debi? Is there a head under a helmet? Get up! This should be good. Pilar, did you know that the girl was so proficient? I did not even know that she worked for us before yesterday. It's a shame that she could not compete. Jumping is not for the mob. Therefore invented roller derby. She is the reason why ... Monty, how about $ 40,000? I will return. 40,000 sounds like a fair offer. Next time I'll bring my own helmet. I knew someone would discover how cruel you are - - And buy yourself while breaking my heart. You're a real sweetie who let them do it. It is foolish to waste your talent because you're pissed off at the world. "My dad can not afford my dream horse." "The other girls are mean." What? You love the particular sound of your own voice. - Do you do anything other than talk? - I assure you ... Make sure not care about anything, Ken. Help me be better if you are so convinced of my talent. Help me. Train me if I can find a horse. Everyone knows that you are the chief of finding rider's hidden talents. So help me find my hidden talents. That said: You love the sound of your voice, but has no substance. Do you know how much I take to train a rider? How would you be able to afford my services? I'm good at what I do, but I does not conduct charity. I want to get paid for the effort. Okay sure. I can work on your farm. Whatever ... Stop messing around. A lifetime mockande is not enough for my fees. Okay. - What do you mean "okay"? - Okay then. - Are you serious? - Seriously. We'll see if you can handle it. He's not wrong. Many fine horses sold away. Horses with fine pedigrees. Just rotten, miserable owners who should never have been allowed to approach a horse. - Broken down horses. - In need of salvation. - As we all are. - Do not start that again. Maybe I need to be saved. I ran and I hid myself. It was difficult and I had to tough for me. We can check the horse market. I can help you in the right direction. I do not need your help. I can choose my own horse. I know exactly what I'm after. An independent talent. - Really? Was that all? - And a lion's heart. Do you think it's funny? He's out there and I'll find him. I just hope he does not cost more than 63 dollars. Come back here, you bastard, otherwise you'll see! Come back here! Your hell horse! I'm going to notice you! And if I had seen a burning bush, I had downloaded water hose. Then I heard it. Sweet as the wine at Cana, bright as the burning bush. The miracle of the Lord's voice. And like a child, I thought again. Come back here! Your freaking hell horse! I would shoot you if it were not a waste of bullets. Is this your horse? Is he for sale? He was there, but I received no bids. And after this teaches not enter. It would be a shame to have to sell him to the butcher. - You can not do it. - Why not, honey? - You just do not get it. - Do you have anything to say? Let's go. I know you hear what I say. - Why would the Lord speak to me? - Why not? Was not as "priestly". I heard it loud and clear, so I must have been crazy. Can I have had a brain tumor like in the movies? I would rather believe that the Lord spoke to me than that I had a tumor. Why do you think the Lord asked you to buy this horse? Or any horse at all? The Lord may have a purpose for you. - I'm not an evangelist, Father. - Maybe not. But this horse maybe it is. Are you going to buy him? At the moment I miss about half of the money. And it is with the help of my friend Tommy and an attendant that I know. So I hope that the Lord has a plan for me no fucking ... - ... Damn plane. - Let me see if I understand everything. The Lord gave you the opportunity to ride. He gave you the strength to jump. He gave you the insight to find a very special horse. And now I hope you are in a magical way to pay for it too? I was hoping you could pray with me and ask the Lord if he could ... - No. - No? It is your prayer, Miss Debi. But before you ask for more you should show gratitude for what you already got. You do not need a miracle to achieve your goals. You are the miracle. All you have to do is put you in the saddle and start riding again. It was not the first time that I asked. But it was the first time in years. First time since I moved from Nutbush, Virginia. - Debi? - Hi! - Debi, little girl! - Hi mom. I've missed you! Hey! I've missed you! - Will you finally move home? - Stop it, you know it will not happen. Let's see if I understand. Lord asked you to go home and fix money from your mom ... - - ... To buy an old nag? - He's not a nag. - Can you paint over there? - Sure. - Love you. - I love you too. I understand there is a lot to take in. But the Lord gave me my skills and a mission to complete. And the horse? Two years, Debi. You have wasted two years of your life by shoveling shit for rich people. I thought that maybe you made something and was ready to study further. That you were ready to find a job, to earn your livelihood. Do you think it's easy for me to come here and ask for help? - I know the Lord ... - The Lord wants you to do what? Savior all rich girls who have always looked down on you? Or preaching to all illiterate who work in the stables - - And do not have other thoughts than how to get you in bed. I do not know what the Lord wants of me. I just know that he wants me to do it through my jumping. And you think this horse is necessary? Do not encourage her, Margaret. I do. I have already saved up booklets. Tommy helped me and even Pastor Brewer gave me $ 100! - Larry, if a pastor ... - I do not care what the country bumpkin think! I'm not the villain here. I know what it can do against a - - When trying to get into a world that does not want one. How do you think I felt when the Redskins finished my contract? How difficult do you think it was to return and train school football? From the top back to school! Debi, darling, you're my little girl. I love you more than ... But you're too stubborn! It hurts to see you throw yourself against the wall until nothing is left. So you think it's better not to try to achieve their dreams? How is it better for me? This is how it is: Two years ago, you went away when I told - - That we could not afford to buy a Sunday horse for $ 100,000. But your mother and I have put money aside for two years at the university. So when you are ready to take your head out of your ... ... Out of the clouds and start thinking about your future - - Waiting for the money to you. Until then, this conversation is over. He will never change, right? Do you think the Lord has plans for Debi? I believe the Lord has plans for all of us. But not everyone can be the occasion. I'm not the same girl anymore. The girl he sees when he looks at me. I'm not her anymore. I have changed. If it were not for this horse - - I would still save to buy a horse. I'm trying to say that I was meant to be with this horse. - Can you say something? - I would like to see this horse. Are you back? The price is the same as the last three times. You bring a school principal here changes nothing. It's my mother, Bobby. She wanted to meet The Evangelist. Call him Princess if you want, but you still have to pay first. Before that, he named Hell's horse. So you have money with you? Otherwise it adjöken. I have to work out this evil bastard. I'm not crazy, mom. I promise. Good boy! So it should look like! Do not stop now! - What is the problem, Bobby? - The coach did not show up. He was the fifth that got cold feet when it comes to this horse. I can train him for you. Thanks for the offer, but the coaches pulled out for a reason. For the same reason as my shoulder injury. This bastard beats up anyone who comes near him. Come again! I can tame him. I know that. I mean no offense, but this horse is not for sweet little girls. You do not have ... the guts. We should go. I do not know how it is with the stake, but my balls are big enough. How about a bet? If I manage to remain in the saddle, you cut half the price. - A third. - Settled. But you must do more than talk. Debi! Please, be careful. Do not forget that if you hurt him, you must buy him. Are you serious? You remember me? We were meant to be together, then you galloped towards me. They think we are losers, but we will show them everything, right? We will succeed and will show them how to do it. Be careful with my horse, damn! - Please, do not swear. - Yes Lady... Slowly but surely. Do not forget me in front of my mother. - Are you going to keep your end of the agreement? - I can hardly believe my eyes. I knew the bastard was quick, but Satan! I did not know he was part kangaroo. It's great. I can get the money on ... four months. A contract is a contract, but it does not apply to life. - Okay, I just need some time ... - It's not my problem, ma'am. The agreement applies today. I do not wait for your juice sales are better. - I understand, but I ... - Today will be good. We have the money. Debi, I can not touch the money that your father has put aside for you. But I've saved up some money - - A sewing machine that can be used to embroidery. It's my money that I earned. Your father has no control over them. No, Mom. I can not receive them. You have wanted to buy the sewing machine for several years. Listen to what I say. If the Lord wants you to have this horse ... Not in this way. No problem. You have already sacrificed so much for my sake and Peggy. Okay okay! Take the poor wretch only! You two are more than one man can handle. If he proves able to compete, you can pay me later. No! No! Gently! Thank you so very much! God bless you! Thanks! Thanks so much! Mom's heart must have broken when I stayed at home. But Jonathan Collier kept his word. A phone call later and I got a job in the stables on the Brae Valley Farms. And when I had time, we trained The Evangelist ... So there! Neat! - Well? - He's fast for a jumper. He will take me to the Olympics. ... And the horses to be sold to wealthy customers as family Dumar. What do you think, darling, we'll make an offer? Michelin old man, you follow me like a protracted cold. - Elysse. - Miss Dumar for you. Please, I have seen you dig your panties out of the groove when you step out of the saddle. I am far from impressed by you. I know, but even Jesus lost patience with the gears. - Who is it? - It's Mr. Valentine. Henry Valentine. He made a fortune in computers. He bought a farm in Virginia Beach and intend to start breeding thoroughbreds. I do not know what I like to see his kind here. Your feelings do not matter. Mr Valentine lunch drop with presidents. - It is wrong in several ways. - Elysse. Excuse me. Bonnie. My sweet Lauren has got me on the case. - We look at the Hanoverian successor tomorrow. - You will not regret it, Kenneth. - I said exactly the same thing. - I will not contradict your future wife. Enjoy the party. 100 ... 120 ... 130000. I must have him, sweetheart. Come on, just 30 minutes before we get back to the salt mine. Look at the horse. He is exceptional. $ 150,000 is very ridiculous. How did you get so much for it? Honeymoon Price. In a year, Kenny does not like to spend as much. So the horse is perhaps longer than the wife? - Kenneth, we've seen him before? - How much? I'm sorry, but the horse is not one of ours. And I doubt that Debi want to sell him. Debi? Debi Walden? Are you saying that Michelin old man owns the horse? Debi Walden? I've never heard of her. Is she famous? No. - How could she afford such an expensive horse? - I have not the faintest, Elysse. - Make an offer. - Elysse, you do not ... - I want that horse. If the girl does not want to sell him, it does not matter what we want. She is your student. Will she sell the horse? Here she comes. Miss Bonnie. - Well? Will you sell him? - The Evangelist? No, I can not sell him. He was a gift from the Lord. - Lord? - I did not even know he was riding. Then I go back to work. You heard her. A godsend. Vilar never? - Can I help the wife with anything? - How old do you think I am? Do not answer that. I have not been drinking enough for the truth. I wanted to visit my new baby. And to apologize for what happened earlier in the house. We think we are so hilarious when we laugh at our own jokes. Like the monkeys throw shit, and sits on the chest. Well, if there was something else, ma'am ... ... I'm going to say good night. - Wait. Jonathan told me about you. - He barely know me even. Was not there. He did not allow Elysse Dumar to ridicule you. He admires you. I have never seen Jonathan Collier admire someone other than himself. It's not very original. A tough girl from the wrong side of town - - Who want to win an Olympic gold medal, which horse than she jumps. - I do not skip any horse. - And I can not judge you for it. I intend to compete with three horses this season. This beauty is my third if he delivers what he promised. You will need a second horse. You have to race as much as possible to qualify. - A horse is not enough. - The Evangelist it. No, no horse is. You will kill him if you try. You should sell him. My husband can pay enough for two horses. Ma'am, I appreciate the offer. Really. But he came to me for a reason and not to fill my piggy bank. Hold back the center of gravity. Very good. Did you notice how much space you had before you were approaching your obstacle? More time to adapt before you jump. It was well done. - Do I look like the fairy godmother? - You know you can afford it. I can afford it, because I do not waste money. It is not only the registration fee. She needs equipment, boots ... - I pay for riding boots. - You are a giver, Johnny. Bonnie, you know how good she is here. She has a chance. To achieve what? She can not compete against riders with unlimited resources. Jumping at the elite level is not too poor toughs. This is not a Disney movie. Listen to me: Sponsorship her first competition. Cover her expenses if she wins the podium. - Do you have sex? Is this about that? - No. She's not my type. There's just ... There's something about her. Bonnie, I'm serious. I want her to have a chance. I pull myself out as soon as she misses podium. And she must accomplish their work. Do you understand me? Clear. Unload him. I'll talk to the guys at the front desk. Hurry up to the stables. You only have an hour for you. I know. I can handle it, Jonathan. Good luck. - And remember: If you hesitate ... - Come on. That's right. Do your stuff. See you in a little while. It ends with a boom in the water pit for Lauren Roubidoux and Dominant. No one has passed the course with no errors so far. - It was like hell. - I hope not, ma'am. Peaches has always hated the reflection in the water. Hold his attention elsewhere. The last pair is The Evangelist and his owner, Debi Walden. Excuse me, Miss Brae. They called right up your riders. Thank you, Mr Valentine. I heard that. I see that we come to the goose that lays the golden egg. Forgive me, Elysse. I must have missed your attempt. Four errors and a time penalty. I do not think my horse has the necessary experience. Ladies and gentlemen, those were the only couple without error. And it was a flawless round of Debi Walden and The Evangelist - - Making them the winners of Lexingtontrofén. Inga fel or penalty. It seems that the hen hit you, Elysse. What was it you said about the experience? It was the first of many sudden gains. But then we fell down to other places, followed by the third places. Then I realized that Lauren, wife Roubidoux, was right. The competition was too tough for a single horse, even Evengelisten. In no way did I get on a horse. No no no! Unload the horses and get out of here, Alex. - I do not even want to see your dog food. - Come on, Miss Bonnie ... Do not try. You'll find the wretched horses and try to sell them as stars. I already said it before: I'm going to call the sheriff. Look. The feed you even your horses? They are just skin and bones. - How the hell did you get them? - I can take her. Okay, what is she doing? Load them. Everybody. I do not need more glue. - Bonnie! - Come on, girl. Do your stuff. Come on, Bonnie. She is small but sweet ... Alex, look at me. I did not even cry when Old Yeller got shot. How much? - 2000 1800 - 1000. - 1600. - 1200. - 1500 is my last offer. - Sure, I can get the money on ... I can not go along with it, baby. I want to get the money directly. - But, I just need some time. - Debi, do not live beyond your means. - Bonnie, please. - No, I already feeding a horse for you. She is also too small for male riders who invest in gold. But you know I'm good for it. It's okay, baby girl. It just was not your turn. For God's sake, Kenneth, bring out the checkbook. - Lauren, we do not need to ... - Just do it, honey. You will not miss the money. I see that you do not. Oh my God! Thanks. Thank you very much. - How can I ever thank you? - Do not do it. There was not a gift. Your partner is expecting a refund. You were right about the reflection on the water. We'll see if you're right about her. Perfect step, very good. Shorten the reins. - Good. - Hey, Bonnie. Everything that girl annoys me. We run a business. It is a tough market for thick-skinned people. She gallops up on his horse and bolts of Jesus. - I just want to give her a slap. - Yes Yes. - She may never be a Sunday horse. - You know what, Bonnie? All believe that a Sunday horse wins championships on Sunday. - But I do not think that's right. - Of course not, honey. I think a Sunday horse proves that miracles can happen. A true Sunday horse wins despite all setbacks. Okay then. So I guess you will rename the mare to the Miracle or something similar. I preferred God's Own, but Mr Roubidoux slammed almost off. So we contented ourselves with a Touch of Class. DEBI WALDEN VÄRLDSRANKAD the hard way RIDERS AIMING UP DEBI WINNER SPRUCE MEADOWS DEBI WALDEN VINNER IGEN VID LAKE PLACID She won up at Lake Placid. She writes that the next race is in DC And we can get tickets. She is our girl, Larry. And it goes really well for her. You can include Peggy there. I must work with my defenders. So far three riders passed the course without any errors. The last pair out to try and achieve the same score - - Debi's Walden riding Touch of Class. It is a flawless round of Debi Walden and Touch of Class. They end up at the top with Claudia Cologne riding Cocolea ... - We have to talk. - Yes we must. ... And Lauren Roubidoux on Criss Cross on the shorter course against the clock. I do not care if it's for the best. I hate it. Debi was incredible today. And even if she wins the jumping we should reflect on the layup. We are wasting Touch of Class on an inexperienced rider? And it wants to replace her against a male riders. Lauren, you've been around long enough to know how it works. If Debi wins, she proves to Touch of Class can reach all the way to the Olympics. I want Jonathan ride her. At this level and with this possibility a man must take over. Jonathan is still among the best men and investing in gold. I do not like it, but it is best for Touch of Class. I do not agree. I took Touch of Class here and I can take her all the way. - Did you know about this? - No, I've never heard it before. And I do not want to be a part of it, okay? You can not do this. I own Touch of Class. You own a third of Touch of Class. I own the rest and I want to ... No, you own a third, and so do I.. And it makes Debi. Debi, win the race. Show what you are capable of. If Debi do not win, then we'll see what happens. It's damn true that we'll see. - When did you tell me this? - We'll talk about it later. I want to talk to the young lady. Follow me. Claudia Cologne and Cocolea takes the lead with a time of 39.33 seconds. The last round ended at 38.27 for Joann Netlaw and Corteez. Unfortunately when the only other place with four faults on the last boom. It looks good. 37.59 seconds. Lauren Roubidoux and Criss Cross takes the lead with a quick game. Last out is Debi Walden and Touch of Class. We'll see if the time around the course without error. Amazing 37.34 seconds! Debi Walden with Touch of Class survived all obstacles - - Take any shortcuts and win Washington International Cup. After our conflict was Mr Valentines invitation a blessing. Before I bought the building I used to sell newspapers on the street corner. And it was a long road that brought me to where I am today. So I recognize the challenges before you. There seems to be equally little place for women of black horse owners. If we do not suede square stables and I'm tired of it. People I do not even know will take a decision on my future. People who I should be able to trust stabs me in the back. - I can not take it. - I thought so. I knew I met a soul mate the first time we met. - When Elysse Dumar got the crap out of me? - When you put Elysse Dumar in place. You will understand that I already have an Olympic rider Scott. He represents me on the track. I need you as a backup if Scott can not compete. Besides that you will answer to Miss Rose, Sandra. Sandra manages the farm and you do everything that she asks. I'm not afraid to work. You can ask anyone who knows me. I suede square stable. I ask myself as a reserve behind Scott. But you sponsor me and my horses even though I compete against Scott. - I have beaten you twice. - Two times out of how many? Do not try to beat your weight class, baby. We are probably on the same page, and I'm not talking only about your role as a rider. We have been facing people trying to tell us - - How to live, where to be, what we should do to achieve our goals. It makes us more than an employee and employer. This means that we are related. Yes, it makes us related. Welcome to the family Debi. Welcome to Trinity Farms. Maybe it was not like when The Evangelist galloped forward. I heard maybe not the Lord's voice. But I knew that the Lord had given me, Mr. Valentine. It's too dark in the White House. Much like the horse show. I guess you do not fear that your partner call you horse thief. I am co-owner and trainer, as Touch of Class with me. Okay, but you understand well that it does not change anything? Kenneth and Lauren have a larger share. The rider can switch if they want. Maybe so, but Mr Valentine would not walk me behind my back. So here it is ... You ... Of... I owe you more than I can ever repay. I still had smoked me stupid and worked in Coeur Blue - - If you have not had lit the fire within me. - You changed my life. - I did not even ... Do not interrupt me. You are a blessing, Jonathan Collier. I will never forget you or what you have done for me. It is best that you leave before Bonnie counting the horses. Take care of yourself, okay? Okay. - Good morning, Mr. Valentine. - Good morning. I would start with local news. You have a new winner. DEBI WALDEN WINS AGAIN! Excellent, Lois. It will be good PR for the Trinity. - Mr Valentine? - Send flowers from us to Debi. Much colors. Very yellow. The card read: "Continue to beat your weight class." We will need a bigger wall. Horses are apparently all the rage this year. Is it a Pony? Come now. Come on. Why are we in somebody dumboms barn? We are here, Tyrel, Sir Valentine invited us. He owns Trinity Farms and was named "Entrepreneur of the Year". He has agreed to show us his wonderful farm. So be kind to thank him for it. You'd think he could afford anything without flies. So how is it that a rich man that you want to own a farm? You would be able to own an NBA-low. - You need a hip-hop rather stable. - A genuine stable? We do not fit in horses. Tyrel, did you know that the first winner in Kentucky was black? Oliver Lewis som red Aristedes. Or that black jockeys won 15 of the first 28 races? Or that the first who was voted to the Jockey Hall of Fame was black? All black jockeys, but a white girl riding for you. Dr. King said: "Do not judge others by his hudfärd - - But by their character's content. " Debi ride for me because she has character. And she can find the horses' wings which leads to my benefit. We go to the training ring. Debi will showcase my newest horse. Miss Brand. Follow me. - Are you here because of your character? - I hope so. Yes, ugly girls have no character. Damn! Damn! That's cool! She skipped! It was a high jump. I also want to do it. Debi! Come here. Come here. My daughter, Debi Walden, is posted here after a riding accident. I have to meet her and talk to her doctor. I'll get the doctor. - Mr Valetine, have you heard anything? - The doctor just talk with relatives. He does it right in. So get out of here before you do more damage. - This is not Mr. Valentine wrong. - Yes it is. She rode his horse, right? You put my little girl in danger, and now she is fighting for life. - Mr. and Mrs. Walden? - Come on, honey. This only concerns the family. We would appreciate to be left alone. Can you help me? I want to pay all the costs of Debis care. Yes. I just have to fill in a few forms. Debis CT indicates brain edema. She's in a coma. However, her condition stabilized. - Will Debi to get by? - We can answer it when she wakes up. - How long will it be? - We can not answer that. Debi does not respond to touch, but we do not know if it is the damage - - Or if she has damaged spinal cord. - What "does not respond to touch?" - She seems paralyzed on the left side. Darling. We want to meet our daughter. Doktor Blair. Doctor Jay Hamilton. Ms. Walden is on line one. That's good news. It's very good news. I do not know how good it was when everything comes around. Ten days in a coma felt like a day at the beach - - Compared to six months of grueling physical therapy. Come on, girl. You come back into the saddle. I see you jump. But I will not lie. Sometimes I just wanted to curl up and tell everyone to stay away. You can do it, Debi. One more step. Lovely, Debi. Now, go on your own. Good work. But the hardest thing was to sell my share of Touch of Class. The most difficult, but the right thing to do. Welcome home, Debi. - I missed you, Mr Valentine. - I really wanted to visit you. - But your dad ... - I know. No one said anything about it. But the most important thing is you are here and that you feel good. I have missed you so much. House! Hey! He is in good shape. I've taken him out every day. - Though he will not let anyone else ride him. - Thanks. I owe you one. They are here to download the Touch of Class. She is still in the stable. Take the time you need. I hate it, my little girl. I hate it more than you know. But ... you deserve more than I can offer. You deserve a chance to fly. You deserve to participate in the Olympics. You deserve a gold. I promise to give her that opportunity. Kyle Brooks. I ride to ... I know who you are and Touch of Class is in good company. You can beat this. I see the fire that burns within you. She likes persimmon. She prefers them immature. She does not eat ripe berries. I will not forget. Neither do I. You nearly died when you wanted to show you this stiff before Mr. Valentine. And now you tell me that you'd rather live with him than at home with us? I appeared not on rigid line. My case was not his fault. Riders can get hurt. It is a risk we are willing to take. I have to stay at the Trinity because it is closer to Claudia, my physiotherapist - - And closer to The Evangelist. He needs me and I need him. Why? You will hardly be able to ride again. I will ride again, tränarn. I will ride again. 17 and hold. - 18. Raka ben -. 4027 ... - How long do I continue? - Until you can put your foot in the stirrup.

Are you okay? Debi? I feel good ... I feel good ... Oh my God! Epilepsy? I do not have epilepsy. Yesterday. Yesterday you did not have epilepsy. Today you have it. - Why is this happening to me? - I can not answer that. The good news is that we can write a recipe for epilepsy. It does not change your life if you just engages you. - Can I still ride? - Ride? Certainly. But what you are really asking is whether you can compete in show jumping. Debi, you have already suffered a serious brain injury. If you experience an epileptic seizure in the saddle and fall back ... A second injury can kill you. Are you listening to me? You can die. Larry, I love you, even if it has not always been easy. Now I want you to listen to me. Our girl has sent us tickets to Governor's Cup this year. After everything that she has undergone. After next have died. After being forced to learn to walk again. After we all said that she should quit. Our daughter was competing again and we'll be there to support her. I know you think she betrayed us when she chose to go his own way. But, Larry, that's what kids are supposed to do. They can not be young forever. It would prevent their development, and we should not feel alone. Ladies and gentlemen, the riders walk the course before the last round - - Of this year's Governor's Cup.

According to the book of Job, the Lord speaks to us in our dreams. But the Lord spoke to me through a brown horse's eye. The Evangelist was my best friend for over 25 years. Whatever we were facing, we did it together. Many losses and more wins than we thought possible. But despite the profit or loss we never lost our passion. Our love to jump together. I had never dared hope to be as close to heaven in this life. Ahead, boy. Not? Evan, it's unlike you. Did you see that? Passion has never played in the manger before. Evan is the only one of my horses that do. Teach you out of your bad habits? You do not think I remember you otherwise? Debi. It's time now. Evan har have. I know. I know.
