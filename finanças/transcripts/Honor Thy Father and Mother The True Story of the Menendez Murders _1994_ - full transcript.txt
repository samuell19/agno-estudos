convinced it was in my opinion but you're not [Music] what about my dad's business associates well we're still checking on those names you gave us bruce fairmont and ellen coster and so far there's no reason to suspect either of them but you still think it was someone who knew them right no probably i mean it doesn't appear that either one of your parents struggled with their assailants oh by the way did either of you guys still have the ticket steps for the movie you saw the night of the murders [Music] we have to look into everything all sorts of areas well we just wanted to keep you up to date now if you think of anything else give us a call okay please certainly anyway we'll keep in touch okay thanks thanks for coming in dance thank you see you soon we've been calling them for the past six weeks to set up this interview i think they'd at least be on time it's been over 40 minutes i bet they forgot about us you think they've waited long enough yeah this ought to be interesting one of the reasons he bought the house is because of the marble floors dad really likes marbles it's travertine mostly from italy let me ask you a question how do you feel about the job that the police are doing if the focus of the time story is the investigation really i want no part of it oh oh why is that because i'm tired of reading trash there are so many rumors no evidence we just want to be left alone it's time for us to get on with our lives i want you to be sure you put that in your article the kitchen has a great view of the back it's right through here well you boys must have your own theories about what really happened huh i believe that he died because he wouldn't cooperate with organized crime but you're just guessing right could have been somebody small whose feelings were along the way a bad business transaction although money is hardly enough to kill over which kill over is a personal vendetta would you like to continue is that the uh the family room would you like to see it wild no wow was it hard for you after the murders i was going through convulsions we'd never seen our dad helpless before yes after the initial hysterex i sort of entered into my dad's mode sort of an esp thing i took over his position in the family the baton has been passed well my sorrow is not really for myself it's for what he would have achieved like kennedy or martin luther king my father was a man of great vision he felt the loss for the country not not just for his immediate family that's how lyle and i feel for sure tennis courts are great you want to check them out youtube boys are facing a whole new world now without the guiding hand of your parents what are your future plans i guess we'll pursue our professional tennis careers hire a coach go on tour it's gonna be a struggle but maybe in a couple of years you'll be doing an article on us i like [Music] [Applause] proud of you this boy is princeton material dad no no no no no you know he got his acceptance letter yesterday just yesterday you know how hard it is to get into the ivy league huh oh no state school from iceland no way jose i will not shortchange this boy's future come on in [Music] okay you know lyle you are following in the tradition of the menendez manor your great-great-grandfather attended mit and your great-grandfather was professor of medicine at the university of havana soon yeah oh put him through uh yes i read it not only was it late but it was sloppy and it was timidly written i can't put my name to this garbage don't challenge me this company was on the verge of bankruptcy when i came on board we are now eight million in the black i want those revisions on my desk by the end of today or don't bother coming in tomorrow you got it good oh by the way

made a mistake it's not the end of the world no no it was a colossal mistake now you listen to me you better think twice before you spend your money like that because it's not gonna last forever that's not fair you spent a fortune on that little chicken wing place i only spent 40 grand well you didn't spend 40 grand little brother you lost 40 grand i gotta go uh can i do for you guys we're doing a story on the menendez case we just got back from princeton where we met with one of lyle's buddies he told us lyle had to suddenly fly back to l.a a couple of weeks ago because there was a problem with their dad's will on the computer can you confirm this i don't know anything about our new will we're planning on selling the computer and lal just wanted to make sure the hard disk was clean he was just trying to protect the family you're not getting along are you well lyle's spending way too much money and he's trying to spend mine too he's being just like father there's something you want to tell us now might be the time remember those two reporters from the times we got word that they're writing an article suggesting that you boys lyle in particular are suspects do you think lyle was involved in the murders did he hire somebody no of course not listen i really gotta get going we'll try to be more cooperative in the future i'll talk to lyle you have my word on it one of the guards will show you greg where's lyle i need him now no i can't wait well the police think we did it eric eric [Music] eric i'm back hey are you all right i'm glad you're here don't worry little brother huh you're losing weight i've been working out pretty hard all right you gotta relax just be normal look uh i'm gonna be meeting a bunch of friends up with the chesapeake fishery why don't you join us you look like you could use a good meal i got an appointment with dr ozil eric mom and dad are gone you don't need to see that shrink anymore it's not that simple is there something you want to talk to me about i'm fine you go ahead i find myself relying more and more on lyle i don't like that maybe i need to be on medication well we can certainly look into that tell me have you been sleeping any better i'm still having the same dreams i just keep seeing my parents faces all bloody and bulging and take a breath eric can we just go for a walk or something i i need to tell you something but not in here [Music] are you going to tell me what's wrong we did it do you mean you killed your parents i think we should continue this inside a few days later we went down to san diego and bought guns with an id that lyle had taken from a buddy of his at princeton we went in the family room they were sitting there on the sofa and we surprised them we started shooting at father mom fell to the ground she didn't die with the first shots she was laying there moaning trying to crawl trying to move we went outside and we reloaded lyle's shotgun we went back inside and lyle finished her off does lionel know you're telling me this i'm afraid he'll kill me i i think it's important that he knows can i have permission to call him honey you ready to go i need your help eric menendez is in my office he just confessed to killing his parents lyle is on his way over i want you to sit out here and pretend to be a patient i'll leave the door cracked if you hear anything in any trouble you call the police jerry i need to see lyle's face when eric tells him that he confessed that i can understand what's going on i i don't know how he'll react he could be a danger to eric or myself i'm going to ask them to let me tape their session sit sit i have to get back inside have you been waiting long you know how doctors aren't loyal we're ready for you damn it what kind of brother are you i'll just listen this isn't a perfect murder anymore eric how do we know that this shrink isn't gonna tip off the police of the newspapers there's no way for me to be safe now he has this information what happens in these sessions i don't want anybody looking over my shoulder that's why i killed my parents to begin with look if you boys are ever brought to trial i i might be able to piece together the events in your family constellation that led to such a situation occurring you mean like the hatred physical abuse exactly see see the more you share with me the more i'll be able to help you now eric says he feels guilty about inheriting millions of dollars of your parents money what about you you do this for the money there's a good chance my father had already disinherited us and why did you do it because he always made us feel so inferior there's nothing we could ever do to live up to his expectations except maybe this dad would have been proud of the job we did killing him do you ever think about him yeah sure you miss not having these people around it's not having my dog around you can use such a gross analogy god lyle eric this is a waste of time let's go look i'm not comfortable leaving the situation the way it is quite frankly that's your problem well maybe he's right shut up shut up i'm handling things do you understand stop telling me what to do eric my brother needs me i want you both to come back and finish the session aren't you frightened i don't choose to live in fear loyal neither did my father good luck dr ozil jude lynn i i can't see you tonight i have to call my wife the menendez brothers know where we live jerry we have to go to the police the boys are my clients what they told me is confidential how could you call it confidential i don't know what to do i don't know what to do god lyle you just made it worse giving him what he wanted eric i was pulling his chain in there he just didn't know it it'll keep him quiet until we can figure out what to do what do you mean i don't trust him even builders for attending mom and dad memorial service in l.a for god's sakes all right you're gonna get out of town you know play those tournaments overseas and get some rest you need it i'm gonna go back east we'll buy ourselves some time and you don't talk to anybody you take your remorse and you swallow it come on [Music] [Applause] okay i understand i'm gonna take care of it personally all right les the uh da's office is on line 1. tell mrs bazanich i have nothing new on the menendez case and if she wants to call and personally embarrass me i'll be here all afternoon detective seller yeah how can i help you i'm um judelyn smith a friend of jerry ozil oh the therapist for the menendez brother yes i've had something in my mind for a long time i overheard an argument in jerry's office it was a shouting match between lyle and eric jerry was so frightened by what he'd heard that he he bought a gun to protect himself eric confessed everything about the killings and and jerry has it all on tape [Music] put your hands on your head on the ground right here face down get down you are under arrest you've got the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in accordance hey uncle carlos uh the tournament's going great i'm in second place what can you speak up a little i'm having trouble hearing you they have the tapes of our sessions when did they arrested [Music] hello eric have your back you don't have to handcuff i'm sorry eric it's a procedure [Music] this arrangement hearing is now in order will the defendants please rise eric and lyle menendez you have been charged with conspiracy and murder in the first degree with special circumstances multiple murder and lying in weight do you understand that the conviction of these charges can lead to the death penalty yes i would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that we have two juries in this case since some of the evidence will pertain only to one defendant or the other you will now hear opening statements from the prosecution ms bizanich during the next month we will prove to you that lyle menendez planned this murder with his brother eric provided false identification for the purpose of buying two shotguns set up an alibi and then set off to spend the money that they had acquired through the killings of their parents and that but for a few mistakes that the menendez brothers made this was almost a perfect murder miss lansing the prosecution has suggested to you that my client lyle menendez killed his parents for money to commit the perfect crime that possibly it was done out of hatred what we will prove to you is that it was done out of fear this trial will take you behind the facade of the rich houses and the fancy cars it will take you to the life that was experienced by lyle and his brother as they grew up for 12 years between the ages of 6 and 18 my client eric menendez was sexually molested by his father it started out as inappropriate touching and escalated in a carefully calculated pattern of grooming the child to satisfy his father's lust this pattern included repeated acts of forcible oral copulation sodomy and rape and it was part of a more pervasive characteristic of jose menendez his absolute need to control and manipulate the people around him eric had vivid examples of his father's potential lethality towards him this was after all a man who used a variety of objects to torture the young boy needles tacks wooden implements knotted ropes these episodes are what eric called the dark days you will have to ask yourself the question why did kitty menendez never enter her son's room when jose was alone with him what kind of mother was she she knows they had stopped eric many times when he tried to run away they said that they would always find him there was no escaping them and that he could never survive on his own eric soon realized that there were no adults who would rescue him so he turned his big brother for help on sunday august 20th 1989 it appeared to eric that the trap was sprung by words and deeds he perceived that his father and mother were about to kill him and he reacted with pure terror pure panic he fired every round in his gun believing them incapable of dying because eric's parents were wealthy the prosecution tells you he did it for money what did they say when poor kids kill when did you first meet eric mr cignarelli junior year in high school 1987. he was still sophomore they had just moved here we were on the tennis team together so we became buddies almost instantly what sorts of activities did you do with eric besides the actual tennis practices now we'd go up into the hills and talk about our dreams for the future the perfect moment a hot dry santa ana with the wind blowing in my hair 000 feet up away from everything yeah the perfect woman blonde blue eyes preppy clothes athletic soft skin a perfect crime a robbery no a murder so convoluted no one would understand it it doesn't even matter if they get caught it's just got to be done with style and flair a statement so bold everyone will notice we are trouble brother trust me [Laughter] after the awful night of august 20th 1989 was there ever any talk of the killings yes we were at the house and uh we were walking towards the family room and eric just turned to me and he said do you want to know how it happened sure we were coming home from a movie to get my fake id so we could meet perry at the bars when i came in lyle was standing there with two shotguns and he said let's do it the doors to the family room were slightly ajar i looked inside and i saw my parents sitting on the couch lyle swung open the doors and shot dad then he said shoot mom so i shot her as she stood up and started yelling you know all great leaders had no parents [Music] what do you mean hitler alexander the great not that they had no parents but they had either died or the kids had to make it on their own you want to play chess or something you became angry with the beverly hills detectives when they told your mother you were a suspect and in response you sent them a fax exhibit 48 but instead of signing with your real name you used a fictional character hamilton cromwell he's a lead character in a screenplay that eric and i wrote together when our fathers start shopping this screenplay around town at the very least we're gonna get some option money you think it's too early to put money down on a benz okay all right hamilton cromwell is 18 years of age with neatly styled dark hair he gives the aura of a mentally disturbed person yet very intelligent scene one the foyer of the cromwell family mansion to my beloved son hamilton i bestow the cromwell estate and all the money in my swiss account 157 million dollars he's insanely psychotic and anxious to obtain his inheritance a character worthy of jekyll and hyde hamilton good evening father [Music] honey is that you i heard a noise and then the power went out there's been a blackout where are you my love i can't see you my father told me i was not worthy to be his son it only made me strive harder so that i could hear him say i love you nothing i ever did was ever good enough and i never heard those words you'll survive my friend a warrior who's lost his parents still a warrior move to strike do we approach you feel the screenplay as evidence that the killings had been on eric's mind for many months it gives a mental blueprint it's a convoluted amateurish document written by two adolescent boys no no the uh screenplay may not be introduced into evidence prosecution will proceed did eric ever tell you that he acted in self-defense no objection overruled did eric ever tell you that he was being abused by his parents no nothing further did you ever observe eric's father emotional or screaming at him during the tennis tournaments we both played in he'd say things like you need to do better he would just criticize him and push him like most parents most parents criticize their kids in front of other people in beverly hills yes tough parents in beverly hills toss it higher eric follow through funnel through he's really been working on his shirt mr menendez obviously not hard enough craig hit it on the rise on the rise dad give him a break your brother works better under pressure lyle he's not a natural-born athlete like you watch your footing watch your footing damn it it wasn't the finals eric don't take it so hard oh no my timing was off i was not brought onto this world of defeat failure does not course through my veins i will not listen to those who complain for their diseases contagious why everybody else saw you make a damn fool of yourself what's the big secret just shut up you in the limo you stay here a loser doesn't deserve to ride in my car don't ever talk like that to me again let's go [Music] let's try it out [Music] mr wright in december of 1988 you spent christmas break with the menendez family delilah tell you much about them what to expect he tried but nothing could have prepared me for what happened that night what were you telling me about that that coach your tennis coach bradley what happened to him last semester i don't understand he he was fired or i mean you guys did very well i think don't you well yeah here comes that dad this is danny right a friend from my dorm right your father's a vp of panasonic i think we've met um my old man said on a mechanic in cleveland the closest he's gotten to panasonic was installing a car radio the boys have probably told you we have a tradition at this house it's been going on for years do we have to do this with guests we like to talk about current events politics even history over dinner nothing heavy just stimulating conversation it's something that jose's parents did in cuba my father he hated idol time every minute of every day was important well his father was a star soccer player his mother was a championship swimmer hmm all right we've got all the trophies i'll show you later let's see what tonight's topic being the watergate break-in i thought um i thought we were still doing the civil war you thought wrong lyle who was the secretary of commerce during the nixon administration maurice stanz uh he was the chief of the re-election campaign was he convicted pleaded guilty and was fined five thousand danny who were the plumbers the bad guys be more specific g miss menendez i don't know i'm a i'm a fine arts major what did they teach you boys at princeton dad come on lighten up the plumbers were a special investigations group eric who was john mitchell the the special prosecutor don't disappoint me son maybe the boys have had enough he could fend for himself damn it i don't want to do this anymore go to your room and look up the answer it will cost you ten dollars for every two minutes eric ask him about martha mitchell he'll probably remember her now she she knew where all the bodies were buried that's why they kept her drugged in her hotel room she was the truth-teller if you don't mind kitty it's between the boys and me and we could use more potatoes out here thank you [Music] here's an easy one for you danny what happened to the president as a result of watergate he lost his job we all know that why the political fallout he lost his job because the men working for him got caught [Music] would you like a hand i've been um banished to the kitchen with the women folk certainly where we belong you didn't tell me we had plans someone at the office is throwing a party i don't have time to get ready jose spent the whole day making dinner for lyle's friend my hair is i don't have anything to wear i'm going by myself see your girlfriend aren't you oh please don't start this i know about margaret i know that she's pretty she's young i've driven past her house jose i've seen her go to work in the morning i've seen her with her little little tailored business suits in her briefcase will you please stop this i've seen you with her jose you go on and on about other women what about you kitty you used to spend hours on yourself we would go to a party and you'd be the only woman they'd talk about look at you now half the time you walk around this house in a fog you don't know whether it's night or day you don't care about yourself you don't care about me or the boys anymore that is the greatest sin of all because they will be the ones who will suffer if we fail them as parents [Music] you weren't kidding about your old man i spent all that time coaching you in the civil war he changed the topics just to screw with your head it's no big deal it is a big deal you're my friend danny you don't deserve to be treated that way now i know why we never had friends over when we were kids what do they teach you boys he's coming i don't understand what the big deal is political scandals are a dime a dozen in washington watergate was a major news event they almost started impeachment proceedings watergate was different eric because it wasn't about greed it was about power pure unadulterated power the kind of machiavellian access one doesn't expect to find a democracy lyle can i see you privately i advise you to find another friend he's weak you don't want to be around that he'll only drag you down why do you have to be so rough on him because i know what it takes to inspire greatness and that boy does not have a clue but you too i can't listen to this lyle quebec lyle and i were just debating the source of greatness what do you think danny is it a learned behavior or is it passed down from generation to generation well um considering the amount of money my parents are paying in tuition i hope it's something you can learn i was 16 when i came to this country without a penny not speaking a word of english i not only lost my family's wealth but the respect and status we had in cuba in america i was worse than a nobody a wet bag imagine someone calling me here whitney so i got a job washing other people's dishes to put myself through college now when i walk into a restaurant now someone washes my dishes and if i glimpse in the kitchen the face of a young man struggling over a tub of scalding water i look for the spark in his eyes and i hope for his future as i did for mine but i almost always see nothing but failure failure mediocrity it's all around us it poisons the ground we walk on and i will not have it in this house you boys have been given so much maybe that's why i'm so hard on you but i know the depth of the human spirit of talent and hard work and you two boys are capable of great things incredible things far grander than anything i've ever dreamt of do you boys agree yes father [Music] good evening he's a real trip that may be true but think about what he has to say here danny take my car spend the night at craigs [Music] i'm sure you've had enough of the menendez family for one night i need some down time [Music] wow a little bit worried about mom when i knocked on her door she wouldn't answer but but her tv's on she probably drank herself to sleep come on why you always have to be so cynical because dad taught me to be the pragmatist in your family you're the poet i'm the pregnant all right come on oh man sometimes i wonder who the real parents are around here mom mom mom i'm not gonna leave you oh no no i can't deal with what you mean you can't deal with this call dad i don't know where he went he's in the car just calling come on mom it's gonna be okay mom [Music] are you feeling any better it wasn't always like this you know i know mom i remember in college my friends would say you know what a waste kitty's a real catch how's that cuba never gonna make her happy he was my hero he made me feel so special i knew he was going somewhere he promised to take me with him she'll sleep it off did you find dad no i even call this office but i did find this in the kitchen i think she wanted us to find it dear jose for 24 years i lived a dream in the end i only wanted to be as much of a friend as margaret i take with me the spirit of love that i hold dearest that of my children and you love kitty mark redwood don't tell me you didn't know why do you think she was so miserable what are you boys doing out where the hell have you been excuse me mom's had a rough night she took a bunch of pills did you call a doctor she didn't want me to she's okay she's sleeping i took care of everything um when i was little i didn't think my father liked me very much so i was happy when he offered me massages what kind of massages what kind of massage is eric he started playing with me molesting me there were four kinds of sex knees nice sex rough sex and just sex what was rough sex when i was 13 he started using needles pins rope he would stick tacks into my butt and thighs did you ever try to stop him once when i was 17. dad i can't it's all right to be scared son i do this to make you stronger no all through history men had done this together before going into battle it made the greek and roman soldiers powerful warriors invincible i said no no eric please don't i don't want to hurt you now get back on the bed and he raped me did it hurt yes did you bleed yes did your father force you to perform oral sex on him he uh grabbed me by my hair and held my head i started putting cinnamon in his tea i heard about it from some kids at school what was the purpose of putting cinnamon in your father's tiara i heard it makes it taste better no further questions did anyone ever see your father sexually abusing you eric no he was very careful did you ever receive any medical treatment as a result of your father's torture no and you never told anyone of your experiences a teacher a tennis coach surely your therapist i was too ashamed okay let's move on to something else at the summer of 89 were you looking forward to attending ucla uh getting away was the most important thing in my life until my father told me he expected me to stay home three or four nights a week not in the dorm and you took this to mean what that the sex was going to continue i was devastated i thought about killing myself there was no escaping him yet we heard testimony from your friend ed fenno saying that you turned down an opportunity to attend uc berkeley which really disappointed your father i i wanted to attend ucla because they had a better tennis program so instead of attending a school 400 miles away from home 400 miles away from the man who was abusing you you chose to go to a school just around the corner i guess geography isn't your strong suit objection sustained i'd like to reconstruct the last five days before the killings starting with tuesday you and your brother claim that during this period your lies were in imminent danger we thought our parents were going to kill us at any moment what made you believe that my mother had already threatened to poison the family she was taking 13 pills a day sedatives and all my dad was having these explosive rages but what happened specifically that tuesday night my mom was acting kind of strange her father was sick in canada and she was supposed to go up and visit him so your father tells me cancel my trip because he can't get away from the office my father may not live another week why don't you just go yourself what's the big deal right right and leave him alone with margaret and crazy it's the boys and their tennis it's your father and his business meetings what about me my father is dying and nobody gives a damn oh why would you stop it we can't hear the fraud look at it your brother can't even keep a girlfriend your father keeps a couple on the side look at you you couldn't even last one semester through princeton before they threw you out on your sorry ass this family is a bunch of losers losers with money that's the worst kind i'm not gonna listen to this don't you walk out on me you don't need this damn hairpiece what do you think it's gonna help you oh your career in politics i wanted better father's pipe dreams give it back to me give it back to me wow it's me i want to talk to you uh yeah okay just give me a second all right i didn't know you were a hairpiece lyle i'm sorry you don't have to be embarrassed i guess we all have our secrets in this family i've been losing my hair since i was 14 eric i thought i should do something about it hi come on don't worry about it it's okay you're the only one i can trust what are you talking about what is it those things with dad are still going on what things you know what things why didn't you say something eric answer me i thought that he had stopped a long time he's been coming into my room two or three times a week oh we gotta do something eric we can't it's hopeless lyle i'm not gonna let you down little brother and he didn't did he my brother's never let me down after you confided to your brother about the sexual abuse you waited two days for your father to return home from a business trip now did it ever occur to you to talk to your mother to uncle carlos to seek outside help even a friend i was frightened ashamed but not ashamed enough to encourage your brother to confront your father and make things worse objection sustained okay let's move on to what you remember about thursday night your father returned home don't you see what you're doing to him what i do with my son is none of your business he's suicidal half the time and it's your fault don't throw your life away lyle stay out of it no there are gonna be some changes around here dad what's going to happen around here is you are going back to princeton and your brother's going to ucla as planned and you are going to forget we ever had this conversation if you don't keep your hands off of him i'm going to tell everybody we all make choices in life son eric made his now you have made yours [Music] it's thursday night before the killings your brother has just confronted your father about the sexual abuse now what exactly were you doing at this time i was upset i couldn't sit still so i went into the family room and i found my mother watching tv did you know it was no i think i'm stupid why didn't you do something no one ever helped me in my life [Applause] kill me eric what were you thinking why did you have to say anything to your brother this was between you and me created a cream an agreement yes an agreement you're ungrateful bastard lyle thinks he's going to ruin me but i'm not going to let that happen do you understand [Music] [Music] it's going to kill us both he just told me he said you threatened him what are we going to do live she settled in we got to call the cops dad's very rich with a lot of power cops aren't going to believe us here's what we're gonna do we are gonna stay put until we figure out a way to defend ourselves okay okay so we decided to buy guns first thing friday morning we went to uh big five in santa monica to get guns to protect ourselves and did you purchase the guns there no the salesman told us that there was a two-week waiting period we couldn't wait that long we might be dead by then so we headed down to san diego and bought the two shotguns there so this was not a spontaneous decision this was something you and your brother thought about we were both afraid but you had the presence of mind to drive all the way down to san diego and use false identification objection sustained even though you've lied in the past about the 9-1-1 call about the mob trying to kill your parents everything you're telling us now is the truth is that correct i'm telling the truth as best i can but the guns about the trip to big five about going down to san diego yes about the sexual abuse that's correct that's all true because the only people who can confirm these stories are dead i understand that mr kuriyama you're not lying or inventing facts or motivations to convince the jury of your innocence i am not did you truly go to the santa monica big five on the morning of august 18 1989 to buy handguns definitely without a doubt i did mr menendez did you know that big five stopped carrying handguns in march of [Music] jamie how long did you know the menendez brothers before the killings about three years i was engaged to lyle so you were well-versed in their uncanny ability to fabricate convincing stories objection sustained did you ever visit lyle in jail many times and during one of those visits he asked you about a movie at close range you know with sean penn i want you to rent it i don't understand well there's a scene where one of the characters assaults his son's girlfriend i was thinking what if you were to say that my father did the same thing to you lyle just tell the attorneys you made a passage what's the big deal i'd see to it that a large sum of money was placed in your savings account you're kidding right your father never laid a hand on me jamie this is a matter of life and death was any money placed in your account no lyle never brought it up again i want to jump back a couple of years to a conversation you had with eric hey looking good hi jamie how's it going okay i'm just waiting for lyle we're supposed to go see phantom that is if i can tear him away from that mirror he's worse than some of my girlfriends oh you know it's that crazy wig of his he spends hours trying to get us straight i actually feel sorry for him it's gotta be a drag men isn't that your number one fear baldness for us it's hips and thighs it is amazing how great his hair always looks yeah well it should it cost about four thousand dollars really how how do you know remember right before he started at princeton when he came to visit me at birmingham he wanted to look his best for school so i went wig shopping with him all right what's going on here huh what are you two talking about eric menendez has testified that learning about his brother's hairpiece days before the shooting is what shocked him into confessing his molestation jamie are you certain that he knew about the wig sooner months before as far back as february or march these photographs show you and your brother naked your head's cropped off who took these pictures lyle my father when we were showering or changing clothes i don't remember at what ages did your father molest you between six and eight i started after sports practices he massaged me then when i was seven the routine changed he put me on my knees and guide me in all my movements eventually uh eventually he began using a toothbrush toothbrush on me he said i don't mean to hurt you i love you he said bad things would happen to me if i ever told anyone sometimes sometimes i took eric out in the woods and i played with him the way dad played with me i didn't know any better i'm sorry eric where was your mother during all this it was always a good question why was she so negligent she said that i ruined her life when i was born that she could have been an actress sometimes i really think she hated me nothing further since we're on the subject of your mother and the nature of your relationship with her i have a question uh here we go the night of the murders you and your brother claim that you argued with your parents then burst into the family room and started firing when you put the shotgun to your father's head where was your mother in my mind uh she was uh sneaking around the side of the coffee table sneaking like she was going to do something sneaky that's what i remember she wasn't trying to sneak anywhere lyle she was trying to escape isn't that true objection sustained when you put the muzzle of the shotgun against your mother's cheek and felt her flesh move did you love her then yes let's go back to the 48 hours before the shootings friday you bought the shotguns what happened on saturday we got up early and we left the house we didn't know what mom and dad had planned we uh were hoping to miss a fishing trip that they'd arranged what time did you return home uh around four that afternoon but the fishing trip had been changed so we were stuck going we were wondering if the whole thing was a setup that they were gonna try to kill us on the boat doesn't it seem unlikely that your father an ordinary man would kill you with witnesses aboard we didn't know what to think let me see if i have this right you and your brother lived in constant fear the entire day yes from the moment we woke up that saturday morning until we tried to go to sleep that night we knew we were running out of time mr walker what were you doing at the menendez mansion on saturday august 19th the day before the killings i was there to clean the pool i would like to remind the juries that both eric and lyle have testified that they were away from the house that entire saturday fearing for their lives and that they did not return home until four o'clock what time did you arrive at the management mr walker not too would you please describe what you saw eric come on you guys said one more set now look you boys have got to clean up so we can leave for the marina i don't want to go fishing it'll be cold out there now look i've gone through a lot of trouble to arrange this charter this is a family outing and we are going as a family what's wrong with you two the only reason you're dragging us out there is because you told one of your business associates that you were a deep-sea fisherman that's enough and now you got to learn how to do it in the house now shut up just shut up nobody tells us what to do nobody you will recall that mr walker testified that lyle and eric were not afraid they were angry they stood up to their parents as opposed to being paralyzed with fear lyle and eric menendez are actors on a par with lawrence olivier and liars worthy of adolf hitler their tearful tales of sexual molestation are not real they're cleverly plotted fabrications we are not saying that lyle acted reasonably he read the cues and he read them wrong put yourself in eric's shoes feel the fear he felt when he couldn't take it anymore he went to his equally troubled brother for help and this is what happened let's do it what are you working on eric's ucla application [Music] schumacher aah uh [Music] in the trial of people versus eric menendez we deeply regret to inform the court that we cannot reach a unanimous decision on any of the counts positions have not changed after three weeks of deliberations mom's not dead i need more ammunition there is no reasonable probability of our reaching a verdict without violence to our individual judgments i find the jury to be hopelessly deadlocked and i declare a mistrial of this matter uh in the trial of people versus lyle menendez we deeply regret to inform the court that we cannot reach a decision on any of the counts i find the jury to be hopelessly deadlocked and i declare a mistrial in this matter the jury is discharged from further participation in this case what happens next as the district attorney has said we have an ethical professional and moral responsibility to retry this case be damned with how much it's gonna cost we're gonna seek justice i don't think that anybody at the beginning of this trial believed that these two young men were abused or could have been motivated by fear but now obviously a great number of people understand the situation i think society is the loser in this case it appears now that vigilantism is not against the law and that's a terrifying thought i do not believe any jury will ever convict eric menendez of first degree murder [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you you
