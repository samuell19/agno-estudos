Lourdes, I feel your nephew so alone. Sonia, I worry about him too, but... It's the way he lives. I only see him in the garden. Or here playing this keyboard. Oh, this is so sad. I try to make him socialize with the people there in the church, but... He is very alone, I can not do anything. He should get a girlfriend. Some friends! Because it's not good to be alone, Lourdes. God and Our Lady will put a wonderful girl in my godson's life! Look. Did I get here too soon, or will they be late again? And Hezekiah, his son - reigned in his stead. - Amen! Thank God! And finally, does anyone want to offer the next song? I would like to dedicate for all children who are hungry in the world. And for my bastard husband. That drunk bastard! - Goodbye. - Bye, see you next week! - Bye. - Bye, see you next week. Come back soon. Hi! You played beautifully today. Aunt Lourdes said you could give me some keyboard lessons. Oh, Sonia! Tell your husband that I will pay him all my late rents until next month, okay? Just a little more patience! - We can set something up. - Hey! - I'll be back tonight! - Fine. - Bye, Aunt Lourdes! - Bye, honey. My dear, I want to talk to you. A very important thing. - Come here with me? - Sure, Auntie! Baby, you know this is a blessed house, don't you? And God does not reject anyone. I know. And you know about my commitment to God and Our Lady I'm a missionary! I know, Auntie. Yesterday I received a call. A mission. Oh, Our Lady of Perpetual Help, how to say... Okay. I have a cousin, who has a son. He's your cousin too, second or third degree. And this kid needs to spend a few days here with us. Nice! I did not know that I have a cousin. And you two can know each other, be friends. - Yeah, cool! - And he'll be here only for a few days just until things calm down. What do you mean by calm down? It seems that they have some family problems. His stepmother, who is also a Christian woman she called me yesterday in tears. She said that if the boy comes home, his father kills him! - Wow! - Yeah, a horrible situation. And I could not deny a request from her. A member of our family, going through this difficult situation. I understand, Auntie. Of course! His name is Mario. - Oh, Mario! - Yes. Nice. Oh, I'm glad you liked it, my dear. I did not want to bother you anymore, but... there is an extra bed in your room. Oh no, Auntie. No problem at all. Ah, that's good, honey! I'm going to change the sheets today, because he arrives tomorrow. - Tomorrow. - Yeah, it was all of a sudden. And… Well. I have to go to that spiritual retreat with Father Ulysses, you know. I will not be here when he comes. But I'm sure you'll treat him like a lord. And I'll be back in a few days. All right, Auntie. Do not worry. And what happened? Why is his father so angry? Because the boy is leaving... From the jail tomorrow, and the father doesn't want him at home. Do you believe that? - From jail? - Yes. - From the prison? - Yes. But, Auntie? This guy is not dangerous? What did he do? Why was he arrested? - And I'm going to be alone here with him. - Honey... Honey. I didn't even want to know what he did. Because forgiveness is more important than sin. - No, Auntie, calm down. We have to... - God... Bless us. I know, but it's not better to think... I'm sure that God, and the Blessed Virgin who live in this home, they will transform the heart of our relative. But you do not think it's better... Where God is, we have protection. - That's great, huh? - Yeah. It's really cool. It will be a few days, honey. God! Be in this room. Bless this boy who's coming. Protect my dear nephew. No, Auntie! Not on the keyboard! Holy angel of the Lord, my zealous keeper. Damn! Come here! You disgusting! This one is already in hell. Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! You are a great musician. I'm delighted! Looks like... That God plays with you. Thank you! You know, I can imagine as God did meticulously every little musical note. One more beautiful than the other! About the class. I usually teach twice a week, for each student. And usually I ask the student to bring a song... Can you play this one? - The Princess of Miracles? - That's right. Ok. Let me see. Bring your kindness, princess, with holiness. The light will invade your castle. Is my abode, Lord. You crown me, and I'm going to bless. Oh, beautiful! Oh glory! Hallelujah, Lord! Glory! Glory, glory! Amen! Dear Lucas, I did not want to wake you, you were sleeping like an angel. I bought many things to eat, and I made a carrot cake, which is in the oven I hope you and Mario get along very well. I locked my room. The key is under Our Lady, on top of the refrigerator. If you need it, for some urgency, it's there. A big kiss. I love you. Can I lock myself in my room, Aunt? Nice. Hi! Hi! - Oh, you must be... - Mario! - Oh, of course. - Hi cousin! Hi, Mario! What's up? Are you all right? I never knew that I had a cousin! My surname is also Hantz! Oh cool. Another Hantz! Thanks for receiving me. It's all right. This is really cool. I also didn't know that I had a cousin. This is for all the years that we have not hugged. Ah, cousin! How was your trip here? Was good. It was quiet. - Right. - In fact... I didn't even notice. And as you can see, this place is very calm. I see. Very peaceful. Oh, and about the aunt. She's not here because she had to travel. But she apologizes. - About the situation... - Oh no! It's all right! - Ok? - Ok. Easy, right? Good! Let's go? I can show you the house. - Let's go in? - Nice! Come with me. As you can see, the house is very simple but... That's enough. This is my... It's our room now. Oh, shall we sleep together? I mean. In the same room? - Yes. - That's cool! And this house is wonderful. It's much better than the place I've been. Sure. You know where I was, right cousin? - Ah! I know I know. - Yeah, cousin. Jail. The worst place in the world. I can imagine. Sleep with one is easy. Think about sleeping with fifteen. Thanks again for receiving me. - Oh... - I do not want to bother you. Don’t worry. It's all right. Look, our aunt made this bed for you. Not very comfortable, but... I think you'll like it. Bullshit. It's wonderful! If you tell me you have a bath in this house I'll kiss you on the mouth. Yes, I have. Come on, I'll show you. Oh, great! I need to take a shower. I get sweaty very quickly. - Sure. Take your shower. - Oh cool. This is the bathroom. It's very spacious, big. For hot water, you have to open the tap very slowly. Otherwise it does not heat up. Ok. Great. Wow, that's delicious. Very nice. There's only one bathroom in the house? Not! There's another one up there, in our aunt's bedroom. It's way better than this one, as a matter of fact. And do not worry, I will not mess anything up. I will not dirty the house. And I never piss in this toilet seat. Since today. I confess that I also forget to pick this up. But I got much better after I came to live with my aunt, because she's a woman. So... How long do you live here? Did you come from jail too? Ah! No, no! I came to live here as a child. My parents passed away and my aunt supported me. - My condolences. - Ok! It's all right. I already got over this. My mother is dead too. She was an alcoholic. She drank to forget my father's beatings. I forgot these things, like shampoo, soap. Can I use yours? Oh, I have some things here that I think can help you. Cool! Shampoo. Soap. Liquid soap. Lotion. Nice. Oh... So… I'll leave you alone. So you can do your thing. Hey! - Thank you! - If you need me, just talk. Okay. It's delicious. Did you cook it? No, the aunt. She baked it for us. Wow! She cooks very well. Let me clean the dishes later, okay? Do not worry about it. Are you new here. No problem. No, no! I want to help. Let me wash it. I can clean the house too. I like it. Okay, we can help each other out. If you want, we can share the tasks. I know how to cook too. I know how to cook eggs. I also know how to iron clothes. Do you like sucking the bone? It's good. This song is good for you to practice the chords. Chords? What is this? It's a set of notes. Wow, this is beautiful! Yeah. For example... This is the "A". Wow!! Wonderful! How wonderful. Try. I can not. Here. Put that finger in here. There. So you... Oh, I'm so excited! My first note! Did I play perfectly, Professor? Yeah, I think you should... I Think... You need to buy a keyboard, so you can train more at home. I think it's important. That boy... He is your cousin? Yes, he is. Nice. And he's going to live here with you? No, no. He's only going to stay here for a while. Oh, nice. Does he have that imposing surname too? Hantz. Yes, he has. Cool! You know, I would love to have that name, Julia Hantz. Do you want to continue with the class? Let's go? Ah yes. What a cute little hole! I think the next time you come, you can bring a song that you like, so we can... Oh, there's a song... I did nothing! I'm innocent. I swear! I swear! - Wow, I had a nightmare. - Sorry to wake you, Mario. Bye! So I come on Tuesdays and Thursdays, right, Professor? Yes! Bye! Sorry, Mario. I did not want to wake you up, man. Oh no. It's all right. It's not time to sleep. So you give keyboard lessons? Yes. You will hear a lot of music from now on. Nice! I like music. Really? Do you play anything? You were looking at me? Not! I was looking at the window there. Cousin. I hear strange noises here. It's normal? Yes. It's normal. They are nocturnal animals. - There's a forest nearby. - Oh, thank goodness. - Good night. - Good night. Cousin! I think I've heard a few steps. No, Mario. They are just... It's just the neighborhood talking. Can you hear? - Are you sure? - Absolutely. Cousin. Do you mind if we put our beds together? And we sleep hand in hand. I'm afraid of ghosts. Seriously, Mario? Fear of ghosts? Okay, fine. Oh cool. Hi! Hi! Do you want some help with lunch? Oh no. The beans are almost ready. Want to play cards? Play cards? Which game? I only know how to play "Hole", man. Oh, great. I love a hole. Does the joker dirty the canasta? No. Just the two of different suits. Ah, ok. Playing cards was what I did most in the jail. Knowing how to spend time is an art. The secret of happiness, is in the way you can cheat the life. Cheat the life. Great. Distraction is the secret. You just can not steal, okay? - Not good. - And speaking of stealing... How did you end up in jail anyway? Ah! As a drug dealer. But it was not fair. The drug I use sometimes. A little bit, it's alcohol. What happened was I went to protect a friend of mine, from an asshole on the street. So... The idiot put drugs in my pocket. The police came. Found the drug in my pocket. Until explaining the whole story, two weeks in jail. Glad you're free now. That's it. Those were bad days. Think. Best place in the world. Have you finished? I distract you with my conversation. Did not I tell you that the distraction was the thing? Of course, distraction is your thing. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Oh! You can not talk dirty words in this house. He sees everything. Sorry. Wow, man. This game is so fucked... Sorry. Yeah. The game is really hard for you. Fuck you. It's just between us. I think something is missing. Something to encourage me to win this game. One thing in the end. Like a gift. A gift? What gift? I choose one for you, and you choose one for me. You can, like... Dance a song. A samba. Totally naked. A samba, totally naked? If I lose, I'll do the same. No, let it go. Let's keep playing. Are you afraid to lose, right? No, no... Never mind, man. My dream as a child was to have a Monopoly game. But everyone was poor where I grew up. So, me and my friends, we made up games. Some naughty games... You know that one? The "passa carta". You have to pass the card to the other's mouth. Sucking like that. We played doctor and patient. "Gato mia". "Rosca-rosca". "Queima-queima". And our parents could not even imagine we used to do those naughty things... Yeah. I just did not know the "rosca-rosca". Oh, kid. Just showing it to you. Only child? Yes. You seem to be a very honest guy. That's what I am. - Girlfriend? - Not for now. Never dated? Incredibly, no. - Gay? - What? Or your girlfriend is the shower? But back to the infamous child's games. You're funny, man. My mind thinks a lot about these things. Me too. No, you look like a good boy. I can see that. I look like? So I cheated on you. There's a lot of dirt here in my head. If you say. Yeah. So. You know that these games are common among cousins, right? Yeah. Seriously. I know. Yeah. Have not you heard those stories? I think so. Cool. Yeah. And now you have a cousin, right? - The pressure cooker! - Damn it! - Oh my god! - Fuck! Today we will not eat beans. What a fright, boy! My bad! I love SpongeBob. Right. It's very funny. Yeah. Very cool. I love that episode. That Plankton has to get into the mind of SpongeBob, to steal the secret formula of the perfect hamburger. This episode is excellent. It's very good. Aunt left a cake in the fridge. A carrot cake. Do you want to eat? Very good. Do you do anything? Anything what? Life, to make money? Before going to jail, I was like a cashier in a kind of lottery house. What do you mean, what kind of lottery? Some clandestine games. But what I really like to do is draw. But I do not make money from it yet. Drawing is cool. What do you like to draw? I like to draw comics. Nice. Someday I'll show you. Show it now. We're here with nothing to do. Not this one. Not this. Can you stop being shy? You do not show any music. Can I see this one? You're shy. A little bit. You do not write the dialogues? I never wrote. Need to put, right? Would be nice. But the drawing is cool. He looks like you. By the way. He is you. Yeah. So would you like to have superpowers? Yes. Which? Be invisible. Fly. Freeze people. Freeze people? Why? Because it's really cool. Freeze people before they reach me. Before they hurt me. Interesting. - What is this? - I'm freezing you, man. - Freeze. - No. - Freeze. - Can you stop? Freeze. Now come here and show me your song. Mario, you kissed me! Oh yes! Relax. It's a cousin's kiss. Very common. Now come play a song for me. Come on, Lucas. I showed you my drawings. Now you play my song. Hurry up. Are you moved, man? I think it's very beautiful. And I thought I'd played it all wrong. No. You played perfectly. Thanks! Is classical music the only one you like to listen to? You can go very far with her, you know. But, there are other musical styles that I like to hear. I just can not because the aunt does not like it very much. Heavy metal. And it has to be very loud, otherwise it's not funny. Dude, do not call her! It's dawn. She will not answer. That's cool, man! - She's boring. - Is she really boring? Yes! She rented this house to us. - Really? - Yes. Check if the number is right. Yes. It is. So let's go. Is calling. She's going to kill us. Who is it now? It's so late. Hello! Do not say hello! Say "pleasure with madness"! My God! Are not you ashamed to call my house late at night? I'm already an old lady. It's not a prank, madam. You are participating in the promotion "Pleasure with madness". But do not be sad, you can win! I have heart problems, boy! I'll call the police now! Everything you need to do. It says "Pleasure with madness". Groaning, like a goat! A goat? And how is this massage? Our massage therapist goes to your room. Totally naked. And does a massage in your body. That way. And... Where is this motel? Well, actually I... I can not go to a motel. If anyone sees me entering a motel. Can be in a parking lot. And it can not be at night. I always go to bed early. It could be in the afternoon. Is that a joke? Oh, what a pity! Pleasure. With madness. Hello. Hello. Oh, I can not believe it was a joke. Oh, no... I thought it would be today... Who knows... Maybe one day... Stop being an idiot. Fuck off. You're not Renato Russo. Come on, stop. I already shut up. I'll tell you a joke. Ok. Tell me the joke. Look. Two sisters. Two sisters. The youngest and the oldest. The youngest spoke to the eldest. Look, sister. It is growing hair on my little monkey. The older one said: Oh, my dear. Mine is already eating bananas. This is your joke. That... Holy shit. What the fuck. You're really bad with jokes. Mario. Wake up! Mario. Mario. Shit. Sleep well. It's good. Good Morning. Good Morning. I'm still laughing at yesterday's prank, dude. Are you better? I didn't even see you go to bed yesterday. I fell asleep. I do not remember either. Yeah. You were naked. Ah yes. You do not remember? What have we done? Are not you feeling any difficulty sitting down? For God. Do not say that sort of thing... I'm freaking you out. I always take off my clothes to sleep. What a fright. - What are you reading there? - But I wanted. What? I said and ran. Sucker. The title is "The Goofy Bird." What a fucking title. I took this book in prison. It's good? It's great! It has many illustrations. Edgar turns into a bird. People are disgusted, but he's a superhero. Like Jesus. Cool. Was that a kind of catch game? I'm like that bird. Do you have any religion? I believe in something. Is that good? I believe in the mystery. So you do not believe in a specific God? I feel God. But I can not tell what he looks like. I hope our aunt does not hear me, but I believe this too. Do you believe in sin? No. Take off your clothes. And the underwear, too. Did you hear that? Sounds like steps. Son of a bitch. I'll have my revenge. I'll get your underwear, too. I'm going to put your underwear on that tree too. I'll take off your underwear now. Do not hide. I'll find you, Lucas. I'll find you. I'll get you, Lucas. You will not escape. Are you listening, Lucas? Lucas. I said I'd get you, Lucas. You do not have to take off my underwear. I already did. I'm crazy for you. - I'm here for class. - Julia! - Your class is only five o'clock. - Oh, really? Yes. And it's still... One-thirty. Ah, then in three hours and... - And thirty minutes I'll be back. - Fine. - Bye. - Bye. See you later. Did she see us? I think she saw your... Now she's going home to play keyboard. Oh my God. Now come here. This one also has that beautiful D, that you did that day. D! I think we can continue. - Julia! Julia! - What? Are you okay? - You took my... - Your what, Lucas? I do not understand. You got my dick, Julia. Your penis? Yes, Julia. My penis. No. I think you're wrong, Lucas. My God. No. Let's go honey. Keep playing. This girl is crazy. For God's sake. What is it? You can not see my drawings. Ok. Are you sleepy? Let's go to sleep? I have to check the gate first. Mario? So beautiful the affection among the cousins. I'm glad they understand each other. Our Lady of Lourdes. Sleep with the angels. What a boring trip, fuck. Oh, I'm sorry. You woke up. Thank you Lord, for this meal. And because we're together at this table, on this beautiful sunny morning. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. You do not know the joy I had, arriving here yesterday and seeing you both cousins of the same blood. In a gesture of fraternization, sleeping together. What happened, dear? Auntie, I'm sorry. We were... Watching a horror movie, Auntie. Lucas is very fearful. He really is. Since he was little, he wanted to sleep with me. He was afraid of ghosts. Yes aunt. The movie was very ugly. Yeah. But did Lucas treat you well, dear? Very well, Auntie. He's kind of clumsy, you know. Clumsy? He blew out the pressure cooker. Mercy! Auntie, I want to thank you for receiving me so well. I told Lucas you can count on me to help with whatever it takes. Yes. And he was very good. Helped me cut the plants. - He helped me in the kitchen too. - Really? I even want to help with the bills. Honey. You are a guest here. Guest, like... Temporary guest. Just for a while. So you do not have to worry about that. Right, Lucas? Yes, Auntie. Yes it is. But thank you anyway. Is not it better to stay in the lottery? Not! No lottery. I'm going! Oh, the son of the lady... Lourdes. Hi, Mr. Emilio. How do you do? All right, boy. What do you want? This is Mario, he's spending some time at home, and he walks with dogs, so I thought - bring him here to see you... - Every day... In the afternoons, ok? Frank needs to run. And he really likes to run. Right, baby? Let's do this? I pay fifty a day. On even days. And do not be late. And... This dog is all I have in my life. If he gets lost or gets run over, I rip your balls. Go with your friend, go. Hi, Frank! Let's go for a walk, Frank? Let's walk Frank. Are you ready for the best days of your life, on my side? - Come on, Frank! - I want to see you take care of this dog. You'll see, he'll love me. He already loves his friend Mario. You're the king of the world, Frank. Hey, Lucas. Did you want to have a dog? Lucas. Lucas. Did you want to have a dog? Ah yes. I want. It's cute, right? Let's go? Shall we go, Frank? Let's go home? Let's go? TWO WEEKS LATER It's nice. Thanks. But I look good anyway, right? - I know, Sonia. Just a little while longer. - Wow! Please. I'll pay it off! No, no! I'm not deadbeat. Do you know. I am a woman blessed by God. I have been praying to St. Rita. I'll find a way. Sonia, please. I only ask you a little more patience. Please! Did you hear that? I heard. The aunt owes a lot of rents. Many. Why did not she pay the rents? She retired due to spinal problems, right? Last year, they called her for a review, and she lost her retirement. Auntie Lourdes, from now on, I'll help pay the rent. Mario. Thank you, my dear. Auntie Lourdes. I'm getting some money to walk with Emilio's dog. And there are two other neighbors wanting. I know you do not want me to stay here for long. But as long as I get this money I'll give it to you. And in a short time this debt will end. You brought joy to this house. You brought life to Lucas. It's changed since you got here. He's happy. He was... He was so bored. He... He missed a friend. Thank you, my son! Thank you. Auntie Lourdes. It will be all right, aunt Lourdes. Please, do not cry. Look who's here for another night of adventures. Did you lock the door, Mr. Bunny? Now yes! This bunny looks very happy. Do you have good news? - You have? - Very good news. What good news? Aunt Lourdes told me very cute things. I think I'll stay a while longer, here in the trunk of this tree with this bunny. Good news, my rabbit! So we have to celebrate, right? - Yes. - You want to see the bunny's jump? - I want. - Want to see? Now he's going to jump. One... Two... Bunny! Bunny! Julia! - What are you doing here? - It's “Cosme and Damiao”! Do you have candy for me? “Cosme and Damiao”? It's only next month. - You swear? - Yes! God, I'm crazy! Ah, then... I'll be back next month! Ok. Good evening, Julia. Lucas... this girl is crazy. Oh, Lucas. You did not take care of it here, did you? I can not travel... Sons of the devil! Aunt Lourdes will know everything! She will know. Everyone will know. The whole city. You damn fagots! My God! Our Lady! What was that noise? Oh, I do not know... It must have been a jackdaw. Sweetie. I feel Auntie Lourdes so alone, you know? She was always alone. I think I got an idea. What idea? Mr. Emilio? Oh my God. Can I participate? Looks like I'm going to win this game, right? Lucas. We will not lose again. Oh, boys. I think the old guard will give you a show. Oh, I did not mean to offend you. Mr Emilio. Don’t worry, Dona Lourdes. You're right. We are a perfect pair. Yes. I think we really are. Look that! - I quit. - Oh, girl! You're very good. Oh, thank you, Emilio. Well. It was a pleasure to play with you. Thanks for the invite, son. But wait, Emilio. There's a pizza in the oven. Yes. And the night is just beginning. - Exactly. - Well, if you say... shall we make fun? That's it! Lucas, put a song to play? How about a wine? You got wine? Look, if you have not, no problem. I can get one at my house. Are you trying to get drunk? This is a house of God. You know. Oh aunt, let's drink a little. It will not hurt anyone. Yes, Auntie. And Jesus multiplied wine too. But he only multiplied the bread. - The bread? - Yes. Yes, but he drank wine at Last Supper too. It is true. Oh, ok. You convinced me. I have some bottles in the pantry. But it has to be replaced later, because the priest uses it in the church. Oh, for God's sake. Is not it delicious? It's good to fuck... Oops. Lourdes. You are like me. May I have a dance? It's just that I do not know, like this... To dance. Oh, Mrs. Lourdes! It's very funny to see Aunt Lourdes like this. She's so happy. I love you, you know that? I do not want you to leave. Never. Do you hide me under your bed? Yes. Where I can hide. You've changed a lot in this house. You've changed us all. You're there, boy! I had not seen you. No, Auntie. Don’t take it off. You look beautiful with makeup. - What nonsense. - It is true! - Let me do it on you. - You? And you know how to makeup? I rock. - Ok. - Do it like this. Like this. You'll look even more beautiful. You will see. Hey, Auntie. Emilio is such good people. Do not you think? Oh boy. Not say it... Look in the mirror. Give me a smile. Look how beautiful you look! You will love your neighbor as yourself. Do well. Amen. Amen. Let's end with the powerful prayer of Our Lady, to reach our graces. Someone wants to dedicate this prayer to some... Lourdes. What did you do in your hair, my rose? Do you like it? Mario made it, my nephew. Pardon. Hail Mary, full of grace. Ms. Sonia, can you tell me what time it is, please? Wait. Where's my cell phone? My cell phone disappeared. What do you mean, disappeared? I've used it right now. Someone stole my cell phone. Someone stole my cell phone. It was with me here and now it’s not. Did not you leave it at home? I just got it. I just said that. Someone stole my cell phone. How absurd. Sonia. This is a very serious charge. Did not you go to the bathroom? The kitchen? I did not take my butt off that chair. I can hardly walk, Lourdes. I bet I know where your cell phone is, Mrs. Sonia. In his things. Did you know that this boy, who is here among us, is he an ex-convict? No! This is a lie! Julia, how can you say that? I'm not inventing anything. It's very simple. Put it on the internet. Mario Hantz. H - A - N - T - Z Hantz. He was... He was arrested by mistake, Julia. - I'm lying, Mario? - Julia, please calm down. - I'll get you a glass of water... - No, Auntie. Stay. You need to know what is happening inside your home. And it does not end there. I discovered something else. I want my cell phone. I just barely paid. Do you want to find your cell phone, Ms. Sonia? Come with me. Oh, I want my cell phone. You'll find my cell phone? Julia, please. Do not do it. This girl is crazy. This is absurd. Where is his backpack? That's it. God is with me. And if I'm wrong, God can punish me. Did not I tell you? The proof of the crime. Case closed. Obviously she put it in my backpack when she went to the bathroom. You're a bad guy, and now everybody knows. Son, did you get this cell phone? Auntie, of course she put the cell phone in his backpack. I can be everything. But I'm not a thief. Oh, I know. Auntie, does your cell phone have a security lock? - It has. - Excuse. Probably the thief tried to unlock the cell phone, so, his picture will be here. And like I said. I just did it. You see. I just tried to unlock the phone. Girl, do not do this. Fine. It's all right. You may not believe me, even though I'm not lying. You know that. But I would not leave my things here in this house. And there's more, Aunt Lourdes. He, besides being a bandit, he is a devil, who has defiled your house. Because he and Lucas had sex! They had sex between them! I saw everything. There at the waterfall. Unfortunately I did not have to register this because I was so... So shocked that the only thing I could do was walk away. - I'm “pleplexed”. - You say perplexed. Perplexed. Is that a lie, Mario? Are you going to deny that you and Lucas are fucking at the waterfall? All this just because he did not want you? Answer Mario! Are you going to deny it, cousins? Did not I tell you? Those two little holes, that only fagot uses... Sorry, Lucas. Sorry, Auntie Lourdes. - I'm leaving. - No, Mario! You know, bunch of old gossipers I'm tired of you! You're going to hell! Forgive me, Lord. Dear... I always knew. Since I've seen you sleeping together, but... It's not my business. And you do so well to each other. I see love in you. And I interpret the Bible literally. And the Bible says that God is love. And if you love each other, you are in the arms of God. So you always knew? Of course yes! Do you think I'm silly? Thank you aunt! But I want you and this troupe of demons get out of my house today. Not one more day. Look, Sonia. With pleasure. This house has a heavy energy. It is true. This sucks. Even prison is better. And my house is pretty big. Me and Frank will love the company. Great. We already have a roof. Lourdes. You'll burn in the fire of hell. Not another day. Let's go, girls. Before we fall on this portal of hell, that these immoral opened. And your hair. I like it. Let's go, girls. Julia. I was like you. Do not expect to grow old to break free. The world can make us very bitter. Do you want some advice? Have sex. I'm not the right guy for you. I like Mario. You just thought I was the right guy because... I was a man of God. But you did not even know me. You did not even want to date me. You just wanted sex. And it's okay! You can have sex. By the way, you should have sex. And you do not need revenge on anyone. Do not believe this little world they invented for us. Would you like a beer? With us? You arrived! Come in. The house is yours now. Hi dear! Want help with your bag? And I'm a woman who needs help for this? Oh, he's wonderful! Aunt, I never thought you would accept the fact that I'm gay. Oh. You're so silly. Thank God you're not homophobic, Emilio. Homophobic? Oh, I'll tell you something. Frank just likes to ride on male dogs. And I love that dog more than myself! - How about picnicking in the yard today? - Great, I make sandwiches! What a cool house.
