Come here! Here! SWINDLERS 24 hours earlier Flight B32 from Nice has arrived with a delay. Passengers who are taking a transit flight to Helsinki, please go to gate C7 immediately. This is a personal and final call for Madame Zhdanok to the Aeroflot flight to Moscow. Madame Zhdanok, please go to the gate immediately, we are waiting for you. She has such a flower bud! Just opened up... Fresh, firm... And when I see it... She can do whatever she wants with me... And her melons! And she knows how to... Well, you know... No. Oh, right. You don't know. OK, that's enough. What do you need? Never! Never! No! No! No! Are you blind, or what? Take off your glasses, you dumbass! Is someone there? Where do you even find people like this? Oh dear god! OK, I've run out of time. I still need to get to Daugavpils, you know. "Baltars" plate will be sold at an auction. I'll finally get it! So that's it. Bye! I can't wait any longer. I promised her that you'd be there! I have to do everything by myself. Alnis! Go ahead! When a moment flashes by... A tired mind from a slow dance... Arturs, are you in Riga? Yes, but only for a couple of days. I'm having a party tonight! The Fat Guy is shooting a video. I've missed your perfect... Arturs! My dirty little Casanova from Aluksne! I'm waiting for you! Show it to him. Is that the right plate? -No! -Well, if not, then not. Although... Lovely weather, isn't it? It just got worse. Linda's cigarettes. Menthol cigarettes... -And I thought you'd quit. -What do you want? Me? Nothing. Dagnija, I don't play these kinds of games. I'm going home, to my Linda. You're playing with fire, bad boy. What's going on? What are you doing? Why? It's already after 5 PM. It's 20 seconds past 5 PM. Seriously? Ivars Valdis? Were you waiting for me here on purpose? Don't touch me! It's her fault! She delayed me. Make her pay. Did you hear me, moron? What's going on? Don't touch me! Listen! Step aside! Take that away! I already took the photo. -30 euros? With our salaries? -30 euros! I don't come up with the fines. Can't you just pay him the 30 euros? Get lost! And you too get the hell out of here! Got it? Leave me alone! We already got divorced once! What do I have to do to end this nightmare? You know what, buddy? If I leave, you'll never find out that the case against you has started. I will give my statement tomorrow. The media will go crazy, and the Corruption Prevention Bureau is calling reporters. You are in trouble because of this crate. Your nightmare has only begun. So think about me, honey. You won't run away! Let's go! -Janis, did you put in the microphones? -The microphone is in his pocket. -Why did you hit me in the back? -So that it would look more genuine. I wanted to thank you for that. It helped me with doing my part... -I felt it more deeply... -Just connect with the object. Ivars Valdis Ozols. The new head of the Customs Department, no criminal record, divorced. Lover of Ivars Valdis Linda, 22 years old. As we heard, Ivar's flower bud. Ainars, a lawyer. A master swindler. Specializes in VAT and money laundering. OK. Continue. Alnis Berzs. A local, part of the president's security. In his free time, he earns some extra income as a bodyguard. Brigita Rozenbrika. Smuggling, precious metals. She lives in Monaco. Comes to Latvia for special occasions. Arturs Pelss. Brigita's man. A "man"! OK. The operation "Swindlers" begins. Duckling! Duckling! Duckling! Stop! Just stay there. And look good. Well? Have to do everything by myself. Relax. Nothing for tonight. I need to take care of some things. -You can keep yourself busy, right? -Yeah. The shit will hit the fan with the song book. I've got pegged. The crate has to go back! Shouldn't get myself into business with you. Keep the rest of the money. Let's backtrack. She'll never agree to that. If she doesn't agree, I'll strangle her with my own two... We have a problem. They're launching a criminal case against me tomorrow. We have to cancel everything. I had such plans for the evening! This is why I had to run here? -Please understand... -No, you understand. You got caught. You're in trouble. It's all over. What's mine is mine, right? -But I... -What? You don't even exist. Tomorrow we'll deal with the money. And that's it. -The socks are being laundered. -You see, everything turns out alright. -What should I do? -You? Pack your bags and disappear for a while, OK? -But I... -What? You don't exist. And if you don't exist, there's no criminal case either. Right? Sorry, got a bit nervous. No worries, your lil' friend missed me. What's the deal with this stupid towel? It's from Palanga! Who did... Stop fooling around! Sweetie! Bogy! You didn't go after all? Pack your bags. What?! Why? Plebs! Vandals! Parasites! My plates! I don't understand, what's the big deal? Those plates are terrible. Janis! If only you knew how much those plates cost! Then you'd also think they're very beautiful. They're our national treasure... Baltars, Belcova, Suta. -And there are only around 350 left. -Yeah, yeah... Freaking art lover. That's how he hides illegal income and avoids taxes. Linda! Bring me a towel! I thought you wouldn't be home tonight, we made a deal. Plans sometimes change. -What are you doing? -No, what are you doing? Why the hell have you invited all these hopsters to my home? There's no such word as "hopsters"! And I always thought that this was our home! Get out of here! Out! I understand. But I can tell the difference between a party and vandalism. It's just a plate! Stop humiliating me in front of my friends. Got it? Do you think anyone's even noticed I'm here? Look! Just look! No one! No reaction! I can do whatever I want at my own home! Look! Poor Linda! Linda! Girls! Ivar Valdis is thrown out the door again! Disgusting pedophile! What is happening to... I'm sorry for asking, but... Is the personal connection a problem? It's your ex-husband after all... What are you talking about? I'm a professional. Thanks for ruining the shoot. OK, bye! Let's pick it back up another time. We did pretty well! Bye! That wasn't "pretty well". We'll pick up the lights tomorrow. Listen, where's my jacket? I'll take a look around later. Peace, man! Let's spice it up! Janis, watch and learn. Boss, something stinks. Find out which good samaritan has sent it to me. Like this! -Get out. -OK, let's hit him? Smoke a cigarette. Boss, I quit for days ago. Get out. Don't cry, baby! Boss! Three, two, one... Boss! Boss! Sweetie! Honey! Run, run! It's 213 kilometres till Aluksne. No way! I don't want to go to Aluksne! You can't do this to me! I'm a man! A free man! Boss! Alnis, a man is drowning. Help him. My poor duckling. The water is cold, right? You're freezing, right? You're going to be all offended now? I asked you, you're going to be all offended now? Did you even ask me today, darling, how was your day? Why am I reacting like this to everything? Why am I packing my bags? You just... Why bother... -Enough. -Yes, enough. I'm going in. -What's with the photos? -What? A month, got it? Don't even think about it. A month! Good evening. -Dagnija. -Your ticket... -Don't you have anything better to do? -...has been annulled. -What? -Annulled. What do you want? We lived at your mother's place for 5 years. And you've settled in here in a month. -Dagnija, what do you want? -It's wonderful! -What do you want? -And Linda also likes it, right? Yes, yes! -Where do you keep your precious plates? -Dagnija, what do you want? I'll walk you out. I'll call you later. -You will? -Yes! Come on. That's mine! Palanga. The dolphins. Unlike you, I don't forget things like that. I'll take it with me, alright? It's mine. You can keep this. Don't rip it! You won't need her. You'll come back to me in the end. Or you'll wind up in jail! I know that men sometimes crave fresh meat. But I'm very progressive. I don't pay attention to crap like that. Dagnija... -Ivars! -Valdis! Dagnija, please leave. Please! I can testify against you, or I can testify for you. -Ironic, isn't it? -What does that mean? It means that I raised you up, and I can also bring you down. You wouldn't do that. Dagnija... Bye, Linda! Dagnija... And leave Linda alone! I love her! Don't come to my... to our new home! Get the hell out of here! Out! -I'm in trouble. -Your prostate, right? No, hemorrhoids! I'm in trouble at work. They've launched a criminal case. Dagnija will have to testify against me. Can you imagine the things that my ex-wife could tell about me? Listen, maybe she's... maybe she's blabbed something about me. I have to disappear. Wait... That means that you could... Wait... Oh god, we need to prepare! -For what? -For the worst. -Maybe they won't put me in jail. -Maybe? -I only have 47 euros in my wallet! -And? What do you imagine I will live on? Meanwhile you'll be sitting in jail, they'll feed you three times a day. And me? They'll sell the apartment! Where will I live? Under the bridge? A prison isn't exactly a resort, OK? Do you think it's like Ibiza there? I'm scared too. Just imagine, there's sex four times a day against your will. Bogy, who will take care of you? Who? I will! You have some money, right? Do you have any money? Tell me. Do you? -We have the plates. -Fuck your plates! You've already put me in jail. Thank you! Pack your bags. Let's be reasonable about this. Does anyone owe you any money? -Yes. So what? -There you go! -What are you doing? -What? You told me, no sex for a month. Do you think I'm made of stone? Just take a proper look at yourself. You're a successful man! You have a good job. You can do anything! You have me! You'll get all the money from them, every last coin, got it? Yes! Yes! Don't watch that! Stop it! I'll get the money. Now! Dagnija can go fuck herself! The criminal case can go fuck itself! Yes! What's that? What is that? Surprise! It's a gift for you. A lucky jacket. -For me? -Yes. Linda, I'll get the money! -I'll get it! -You''ll get it! They can all go fuck themselves! Cookie, come to mommy! My little snowball! Who's the best dog in the whole world? Who's the best dog? Of course it's you! Where's your jacket? -What jacket? -The one I gave you. It's being cleaned. Really? I can see everything. Yes, boss. Stop looking at those stupid pictures and get me some ice cream. Damn! -What? -It's that I... I forgot the code. What code? Boss, what does "ice cream" stand for? Do you know what you are? You're a moron. I know I can't call you that. But ice cream is ice cream, no codes there! Get me chocolate ice cream. With chunks. Listen up, free man. I upgraded you. I tuned you up. I can do whatever I want with you. Did you understand what I just said to you, duckling? Stop, duckling. Run, duckling. Swim, duckling... Can you all stop messing with me? My darling! My cutie pie! He doesn't mean that. Let's not argue. We love each other. Yes. Boss! They didn't have ice cream with chunks. So I bought them separately, ice cream and chocolate that I broke into pieces. Wait in the car. Okay. Stop. Looking good. That would make a perfect Instagram Story. We'll play later. I need to bring some money to the lawyer. Meanwhile you, duckling, can pack the bags. Don't forget your passport. Got it? Can you imagine, duckling, someone thinks that he can screw with me. You know me... I'll find him and grind him into meat. Ice cream? OK. And take Cookie outside. Ainar, you are not Weinstein. Hi! I think your pants are missing. What's going on? I can't hear anything. I put the microphone in his coat pocket. Now he's wearing that jacket. Stupid Linda! That stupid jacket! Do something! Listen, lawyer. I want my money! Socks. What socks? Socks. "Socks" means "money". Socks, money. -Are you insane? -Money is socks. Are you handing out socks? Listen! This is serious business. Do you realize that Dagnija will have to testify against me? Dagnija! She even came to my home to take a photo frame from me. What? Which frame? From Palanga, with dolphins. A photo frame. Look at me. See? Do you know what it's called? It's stress! I don't even know what has caused it... Is it the upcoming court case? Or is it Linda? I think it's caused by Linda. And by the fact that I don't know what will happen to me if I don't bring home the money that belongs to me. -Socks! Socks! -Alright! Socks! Do you understand? She's got my balls right in her hands! I feel like a total idiot! For her, I'd even be willing to... ...wear pantyhose. Where did you get that stupid jacket from? Are you a total moron? It's Versace! Sit down. And now tell me what to do. -First you should assign the apartment. -What should I start with? Are you insane? Do you think that I can assign an apartment till tomorrow? Are you kidding? I'm a lawyer. I'll figure something out. Some dates, here and there. It'll be OK. I'll help you out. Big Baltars. Give me a cigarette. Are those Linda's cigarettes? -Do you love her? -Who? -Linda. -Of course I love her. And does she love you? She loves me. -As long as I have my socks. -Get married. Again? You'll keep the apartment, Linda will relax, and you won't feel stressed anymore. -I won't lose anything? -No, you won't. That's exactly what I wanted to hear. Give me the cigarettes. And get me some socks. No one's ever run away from me. He's wearing my jacket. Got it. The kid is cheating on you with a dude, I will... Alnis! -Just follow him. -Yes, boss. Go ahead! -Go ahead! -Calm down. Calm down. -I apologize. -What? -I apologize. -Oh, really? Go fuck yourself! Did you put it in? Two! One in the car, the other in the jacket. I was quick as a flash. Even I didn't notice. I put all the bugs on him. Well, you shouldn't have put all of them. Are you out of your mind? Is this some kind of a stupid joke? Can you at least tell me what it's all about? Be patient. You'll find out soon. Get out! Fuck! There's no signal. Get out! Come, come, come. Right here! Wait. This is instead of a ring. Linda. Let's get married. -What? -Let's get married. Tonight. Now. -No! -What do you mean, no? I don't understand, are you experiencing a nervous breakdown? I want a big wedding. I want a dress by Katya Shehurina. I want invitations from Manilla. I want the chef from Vest. I want helium balloons. I want a photographer! We'll need some pictures! Besides, we haven't even discussed it. -I need to assign everything to you. -What? When you become my wife, everything that's mine is immediately yours. And everything will be secure. -My bogy! -Linda. I love you very much. Very much. -I need to see a friend. -What? I need to borrow a dress. Go! -The jacket! -What? -Give me the jacket, please. -What do you need the jacket for? I'm cold from the champagne. I'm sorry. I love you so much. You're like Rocky, up and down, up and down! Idiot! Thank you. You're leaving again? So this is what you're really like, huh? Ivars Valdis knows how to pamper me. He makes me coffee in the morning. Says some kind words. He was pretty nice after all. Unlike you. What? Games? I love it. What are you doing? Come on, Linda. -Give me the jacket. -No. Come on, Linda, stop fooling around. I'm trying to understand why you won't break up with that old hag. Ivars Valdis will go to jail. Tomorrow. Just think about it! Hold your horses! All the doors will open for us! What else is in there? I know! -Arturs! -Linda, what are you doing? I'm just leaving a little something for her to remember me by... ...or rather, to remember us by. You've completely lost your mind. Exactly! And that's why you want me. OK, let's do it. Just quickly. Yes! You see? Alnis! -Boss! -Open the door. Everything is clear. Let's finish this up. Now I won't need to get my hands dirty. You can call everyone for Linda, firemen, police, ambulance, and the morgue. This operation, Janis, has ended successfully. -Really? -You've done a good job. -Should I call municipal police too? -Yes. Awesome! Execute the order! -Yes? -Yes. And get ready for a promotion. Hello. Darling... Sweetheart... You've ruined my entire life! Sweetheart! My sweetie! My sweetie! Calm down, sweetie. I've come back. Forever. I want to be together only with you. I told you you'd come back. What? I'll be right back, I need to pee. Dagnija, you'll pay for what you've done! -Boss... -Relax. Give it to me. Listen, I think that you kill people for things like that, no? -Should I shoot him? -What's going on? I don't understand... Alnis. Is that your bride? Alnis, what do you think? How much does a chick like that cost per month? Should I tie him up, boss? You can go. Where did you get the Versace jacket? It was a gift. From who? From my fiancée. Where is she now? At the hairdresser's. She's straightening her hair? At this hour? -She's at her friend's place. -Really? I have a question. Why are you so bad in bed that she needs to cheat on you? She... -She... -Is it because you have problems? -Listen... -No, you listen. Why do you let your underage chick steal carrots from someone else's garden? Maybe the garden should have a fence? OK, that's enough. Let's get down to business. I wanted to give you money, then leave, and all our business would end there. -And I thought... -Did I allow you to think? Cognac! Louis XIII. Everyone at the Revenue Service drinks this? What do you want? My bag. Open it. -This is your money. -My? You'll get it if you do another thing for me. You need to get rid of some people. -What? -Look. Do you want me to kill your son? There, under that sheet you can see your Linda. -Yes. -No. It could just as well be my mother. Really? Wait, is that live? Bingo! -I have an idea. -What is it? -Who are you calling? -Linda. -Hello. -Hi, darling. Where are you? -What are you doing? -I'm... -At the hairdresser's. -Of course you are. And what are you doing? I'm watching a movie, it's very... realistic. You know, honey, you were right, we will have a proper wedding, everything that you wanted. There's no need to rush. A dress from Paris, shoes from the UK. -A limousine. A castle. Everything. -Yes... It'll be the most beautiful day of your life. Can't wait. You! You can't keep an eye on your own puppy, and now you want me to kill him? He only hangs out with you for the money, yet you reproach me for the same thing? You buy him, but he still cheats on you. And she also... wanders around. You're all just castrating me! Do this, do that! Do something else! Shoot me! Why are you watching that? Shoot me. What are you doing? What are you doing? No! -Step aside! -No! What are you doing? -I'm singing. -Why? They teach you at the self-defence course, if you're in danger, you have to do something weird. Give it to me. Do you want me to do that? Then give it to me. I'll do it. Let's go. "Nessun Dorma". That bitch! Oh, you! Old hag! He's mine! Do you understand? He's mine! I'll use... every law... every article... To lock you up! I'll shoot them! I'll shoot them all! And I'll start with you! Respect! Respect! That's too much. I'm calling it in. If you can't handle this, get the hell out of here! -I'll deal with it myself. -What am I supposed to do now? Improvise! Dance! -Yes, look. -Dance faster! -Please. -Dance prettier! Dance away! Get lost! -Get out! -Boss. Quickly! -What? -Quickly! Should I tie you up? -Should we take a cab? -He'll be right back. He will? Address? What's the address? Open the door. Give me your hand. Don't move! Boss! What was that? Did your old hag arrive? -No, your old man is here. -What? -What the hell did you tell him? -That I'm at the hairdresser's. -What are you doing? -I'm dead. Bye. I'm simply dead. And if someone asks, I don't even know who you are. -What are you talking about? -What am I talking about? What are you talking about? What are you doing, you moron?! What are you doing? -What are you doing? -What have you done? -What are you doing? -What am I doing? Yes, what are you doing? No, no! Please. I don't know. I don't understand how this happened. I just... I don't want to! Duckling! Down. On the carpet. So you're her little... bitch? That little bitch is your hairdresser? Is that your hairdo for the wedding? Who do you think I am? I bought you an apartment, a car... Plates by "Baltars" that cost 1000 euros per square centimetre! How much? And you're... sleeping with him! I'm not marrying you, got it? -Oh really? -That's it! Don't hurt my... woman. Hey, dude. Don't do it. Please, don't kill me. Please, don't! Don't kill me! No! Calm down! He won't do anything! -I won't? You think I won't shoot him? -Of course you won't. What are you laughing about? Come here! Come here! I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm dying. They'll arrest me now. They'll arrest me now. You'd be arrested anyway. You are not dying... Go fuck yourselves! Go fuck yourselves! I'm going to Aluksne, to my mom! 213 kilometres, but such a huge difference in intellect! You! It's all your fault! Come here. I love you. I won't go to jail. Dagnija! Open the door! Police! You're under arrest for conducting an unsanctioned investigation for personal gain for official misconduct, blackmail, illegal wiretapping, and intimidation. Stop, stop! I'm her lawyer, and I'm going with her. I don't know who you are... Be quiet! Anything you say will be used against you in the court of law. Let's take them both. Yes, boss. The meat is in the belly. Just not the yellow ones. -I love the brown ones. -I prefer the yellow ones. Excellent. Arturs! Arturs! You're alive! We're both alive! Do you know what I have? Look! Could you get 1000 per cm for this too? I got these at the local "Rimi" store. Should we go for a ride? Yes, let's go to Monaco. Three, two, one. Run, run! It's 2471 kilometres to Riga!
