I really just need, like, two lines for the top of the press release. Should we say it's about an, I don't want to say an abusive relationship, would you say difficult? - Well, I don't know, I think maybe we should focus more on the loss of self-esteem that comes from being, you know. - So loss of, loss of self-esteem. - [Billy] Loss of, loss of self-esteem. - Should we try and get some with the award in the shot? - Yes, yes. - [Benjamin] Well, really? to be like it was there's this thing I won seven years ago-- - Couldn't we open a window? It's been quite a while since Happy came out, which I loved, by the way, as you know. - Thank you. - I guess people will want to know why. - Yeah, well, I think it just took me a while to come up with something I wasn't, I don't know, I think when people say that they like what you've done, it's best to just stop doing it, Ideally, I'd have just made that film, and died. Is that not a good answer? - Should we just say you're a perfectionist? Ugh, do you know what, I'm gonna have to get this, I'm really sorry. - That's okay. - Martha, I'm in the cab right now, yeah.

(Noah laughs) - [Atticus] Okay, maybe not an old woman, but. - Stop saying, "Here we are," we know where we are. Would it be better if I tied you up? I'm gonna go, and I'm gonna come back again. - [Atticus] Okay. - Hello. (Noah laughs) So, what do you think, funny, sexy? - Both, both. You look kind of elfin. - Really? - Yeah. - Do you like elves? Maybe we should kiss, is that a good idea at this stage in our lives? - Are you okay? - Sorry, I'm a child of divorce. - I'm vegan, this is a dream. Do you want to talk about the divorce? - Not really-- - I was 13. - Do you know it wasn't your fault? (slow music) - Where do you want me? - Stop talking. - Okay, I'll keep, keep talking, no, no? (slow music) - Goodbye, I'm really sorry, my mum's coming over, so it's probably best if you're not here when she gets here, but it was good to meet you. - [Stephen] Sure, sure, well, maybe it's time I met your mother. - [Stephen] No, I'll be quicker. - [Stephen] That was, that was a, that was.

I don't, that was a joke. - Yeah, I got it. - [Stephen] Yeah. - Should we maybe not tell Benjamin about this, just 'cause it's. - It's probably not a good idea, so. - [Stephen] Yeah, good idea, yeah. Well, I'll miss you. - Is that another one? - [Stephen] Yeah. - Cool. See you. (door slams) (slow piano music) - Hey. - Hi. Sorry, I was just staring at you. I'm Benjamin. - Hi, Benjamin, I'm Noah. - What about all that sex, huh? (slow piano music) What was that? - Oh, I don't know. I like your place, it's pretty cool. - [Benjamin] Is it? - Yeah. - [Benjamin] You can take anything you want. Do you want a piano, have a piano. Okay, this is a good porridge, we're all gonna have a lovely time. What's your type, or what do you usually go for? - I always end up with geeks like you. - [Benjamin] Oh, good. - [Noah] Shit. - What happened? - Oh, there was a manager at the party, he just said he doesn't want to manage us. - [Benjamin] Oh, who is this guy, is he? - He's quite a big deal. - Well, I don't know if this is helpful, but external validation isn't everything. Like, what's, what's important is that you know that you're great. - Yeah, that isn't helpful. - Okay, I think you'll get another manager. - Yeah, sorry, I just, I just don't want to go home yet. - [Benjamin] Well, you won't, you mustn't. - Okay, listen-- - [Benjamin] Oh, no, I'll, what, oh, you don't have to eat the porridge, I don't want to pressure you into the porridge. - No, no.

Sorry, Martha was having a crisis. - Oh, yeah, Martha, with the chairs. Is there somewhere we can sit? - [Stephen] Hey. - [Harry] What the fuck, man, what was that? to be a playful, you know, a knee behind the knee-- - [Harry] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, - [Benjamin] This is Stephen, he's very playful.

Thank you. Okay. Bye. - [Benjamin] Bye. (slow piano music) - Which, on the one hand, is this sort of nice, interesting, lovely kind of romantic comedy about him and his non-relationship Harry Barrage, he's in the new Piranoti film, Sibling. But then, the other half of the movie, as implied by the title, No Self, is about the Buddhist idea of the self being a projection and an illusion to somehow protect you from falling in love. the pretentious monk from a film about this Buddhist, and, but it has absolutely no place being in this film at all. And you think, why didn't some producer just go, enough with the monk, just do the thing that you did before, that you can do, less monk, we've had maximum monk. The reason I'm getting slightly exasperated is 'cause I'm sort of disappointed, because, you know, you see somebody, and you're a bit, like-- - He's let you down? - He's let himself down, and the whole-- - He's let everybody down, (laughs) I'm sorry, it's not funny, actually, it's not funny. (slow piano music) (traffic rumbles) - It's actually this way. (overlapping quiet chatter) (slow piano music) (overlapping chatter) - I could just say the Southeast Asian archipelago. (overlapping chatter) You like that? (overlapping chatter) Okay, very good, is it Southeast Asia? - [Director] South Asia. - [Director] Yeah, yeah, yeah, and can I just have one, - [Actor] Yeah, so this is the first shot where you've ever seen. - So how's it looking? - Well, it's all good. - Tell me, what have you been up to? Oh, fantastic having a proper project. Lucy? - Do you go to lunch, or a-- - Lucy, we need to start shooting, or we'll lose the children. Sorry, sorry, I'm listening. - No, I was just thinking, I'm not sure exactly what I want to do next, and I just thought, if you have anything coming up that needed a director or anything, then I'm really up for doing something that doesn't come directly out of my own pain. - What is all this pain that you're in, Ben, I mean, are you really in pain? - [Benjamin] Oh, sorry, am I in your seat? - Yeah. - [Benjamin] I'm sorry. - Oh, no, oh, so sorry, it's just a packed day. - Yes. this is all looking so good, congratulations. - [Danny] Oh, thanks. - [Danny] Oh, you're the competition winner? - No, no, no, I'm no one. Do you know what time it is, do you-- - Oh, I'm so sorry we haven't been able to speak properly. - Oh, it's okay, sure, we'll catch up whenever you're done with all this? - Yeah, I'd love that. - Great. - I'd love that. Lovely to see you. - Yes. Okay. - You know where you're going? - Yeah. Okay, bye. - All right, bye bye. - [Assistant] Can we have quiet, please? - [Benjamin] Oh, sorry, forgot my bag. - [Assistant] And let's turn over. (slow music) ♪ Don't make me go ♪ - Yeah, my name is Harry Barrage, I'm an actor. My favourite film from childhood? I would probably say The Parent Trap. - Like, my own idea was, like, if there was, say there's, like, a part, or a character, or something that you've never got the chance to play, and you'd love to play it, or, like, if there was a role that you'd never been offered, then I could probably write that for you? - Oh, tell Ben about your big nude scene. It's Harry's cinematic debut, oh, apart from your film. But does that count, I mean, this is being released. - I think it counts, but, so what, you're a bit naked? Or, like, the penis? - Yeah. - How do you, I mean, is that okay, 'cause it's the character's penis? - Ben, I don't know if I should say this, it may be, like, insulting to your craft. - Oh, please, I'm, this is a safe space. - I'd really love us to write something together. so many standard, mainstream bullshit scripts. I love the way you don't chase success, you know? - And it would be so, like, it would be so fucking cool to create something with you that's, like, totally original, but, like, not an easy watch. - Yeah. It can be quite intense writing as a pair. Like, I've actually been writing something with Stephen, a completely different-- - Who? - My friend, Stephen, he-- - Oh my god, we never talk about that again. You slept with that idiot dancer. - She's not an idiot. - It's just obvious. God, Christ, can you take this off me? - Well, it would actually be this funny-- - Yeah, yeah, 'cause he's so funny. - Do you have an idea for a story? - Well, I don't think we should limit ourselves to the idea of telling a story. - [Billy] Okay, so you'll do it. - [Benjamin] Well, I don't know if I should commit to anything right now. - [Billy] Okay, who are you texting? - No one. - [Billy] So weird. (slow piano music) - Wanting this, wanting that. If you are expecting things, make no mistake, you are a puppet. (slow piano music) Many people, they search their whole lives, looking for a false reputation, but finally, there is obscurity, and obscurity, this is the best thing. (slow piano music) - [Benjamin] I don't know, is there, is there a character? Or something that you've got in mind? - I mean, I can see maroon, for some reason. - [Benjamin] The colour? - Yeah. - [Benjamin] Okay, um. Maroon. But, like, if we were to say how we imagined the film beginning, or can you see that? - Well, I think it's, I don't think we should be too literal about it. - No, no. Maybe we open on maroon. - Hmm. And there's a feeling in the air, of, is this blood? - [Benjamin] Okay. And, it turns out to be? - A coat. Yeah. - [Benjamin] Okay, great, yes, and wearing the coat is you, maybe? - Yeah. - [Benjamin] Okay, and you, you're, what are you, what are you doing? - I'm asleep, I'm dreaming. - [Benjamin] Okay, what are you dreaming about? - A swan. - Okay. Okay, and then, sorry, is there a particular kind of message, or an idea-- - Could I sketch you? - [Benjamin] Can you sketch me? - Yeah. - And you should take your top off. - Why, what do you? How are my nipples, good texture-- - Shh. - What do you like to, to paint most of the time, is it-- - It's difficult to talk about. - All right. But is it, is it usually people, or fruit? - Well, it's everything, you know? I mean, if you say, what do I paint, I would say feelings. My paintings are kind of like my journals, so I can look by and say, that's how I was feeling last week. - Oh. How were you feeling last week? - Well, I'd have to go in the other room and look. So, it's not completely what I was trying to do. - Oh, wow. Wow, you, you made me sort of attractive. - You are attractive, seriously, I find conventional beauty so boring. - Okay, then, should we go back to work, or? - And this is the work. - Yes. Should I draw you? (Harry laughs) - Okay, cool. - Oh, wow, gosh, okay. Is that the penis from the film? - How are my nipples? - Yep. Hmm. - You seen my bedroom yet? - Do you have a bedroom? (slow music) Oh, sorry. (slow music) Maybe, oh. - [Harry] You can write here, if you want. Let yourself out whenever, yeah? - Okay, yeah. I'll flesh it out a bit. - You okay, you seemed a bit distracted. - Oh, no, no, I was, I liked it, we did well. What are we gonna say to Billy about this-- - What do you mean? - I mean, will we want to do this again, or? - I think it was kind of an experiment, you know? - Oh, good, what were the results? You let me know. Okay, oh. Okay. (door slams) (slow orchestral music) (bell rings) (overlapping chatter) (slow violin music) Hi. Hi. How are you? - I'm good, I'm good. - Good, is this a bit strange? Was it a good day for music? - Good, I was just wondering if you might still be in the business of being interested in me? by being a lunatic, and I've sort of missed you. - I missed you, too. - Really, have you, how much? - A bit. - Like, maybe we should just have fun? Rather than anything more formal, like, maybe we should just be people, should we just be people? - Is that what you want? - [Benjamin] Yeah, just people. - Okay, I think we can be people. - Great. So what should we, or how should we, a handshake? (slow piano music) - Did you all sleep, or maybe it's just the, the beginning of a love story. Yeah, and there was a moustache, (mumbles). (slow music) - Oh, god. (both laugh) - Did I look cool? - Yeah. (both laugh) (slow piano music) Wait, where's D minor? - Just move your first finger down one key. Yeah, yeah. - Right there? That's it? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, and so then. (slow piano music) That's B minor. - Yeah. - Okay, okay, right, this is all making sense now. - Okay, so play it again slowly, and think of something sad. (slow piano music) Good. (slow piano music) Really good. (slow piano music) - Okay, now play a Vanessa Carlton. (slow piano music) Amazing. This is like what monkeys do. - Shh. - [Benjamin] Right? - No talking in the bath. - Is there a French word? - [Noah] Don't speak. - Okay. Well, what are you doing? - Shh. - Oh, god, no, please, I don't like this. I don't like it. - [Noah] Hey, it's okay. Hello. Would you like to be my boyfriend? (slow piano music) What'd you just do? (slow piano music) (overlapping chatter) (slow piano music) - A funny place, don't mind, but. (audience laughs) (overlapping quiet chatter) Are you in show business, get your foot off the stage. Right. (audience laughs) Let's get the next one out, shall we? All right, tickled, thank god, right. Hey. Nice socks. Nice, you're not gonna need those, 'cause this bloke is gonna laugh them straight off your feet. Here we go, are you ready for your next act? (audience cheers) He's a great friend of mine, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Stephen Arnold, come on. (audience cheers) (audience applauds) - Hello, audience, how are you? You like to laugh, huh? (overlapping chatter) I laughed so hard, some milk came out of my nipples, which was unexpected. What about all this sexism, right? I mean, how is there any sexism in the world when we all come from a woman? I mean, when do we begin to be sexist, are we just there in the womb, being like, but I think my dad would do a better job. (audience laughs) Sorry, are you okay, is, oh, right. He's getting married. (audience oohs) Oh, there she is, wow, round of applause for the, for the future groom and bride. Wow, congratulations. (audience applauds) You know, everything ends. (audience laughs) That's something you can count on. Any, any orphans in tonight? No, see, that would be tough, that must be really tough, but I do think if my parents were dead, I'd find it a lot easier to kill myself. No, okay, show of hands, who's father hit them? No, come on, come on. You guys know, no, man, Jesus. - [Audience Member] Fuck off, mate. - Oh, this is, this is terrible. Right. No problem, no problem. (audience gasps) You know, actually, I think, I think, I think that's me, good night, everyone. Sorry, did someone say encore? - Are you all right? - I don't know, I suppose. Hey. - Hey. - [Benjamin] Hey. - So that was great, right, perfect date night. - It was, it was very real. - What did you think, Noah, you're the voice of youth. - I think it was funny, maybe it was just the wrong crowd, or, but it was good to see you on stage, and perform. - It's cool, it's cool, it was cool. - Please don't upset Noah, he's very young. - Well, what else would he be? Hey, is this gonna be a film soon, huh? - Okay. I think that we, maybe we need to leave? - But we'll come, we'll come to the next gig. - No, that was my last gig, do you want me to sign any autographs, or? - So when's the next one? - No, that's it, I've been doing it for eight years, I can't write anything new, all that's happening is I'm just, just getting older. Don't waste your life like us, I don't know, this guy knows what I'm talking about. - Okay, I think maybe it's home time, but thank you for all of the laughter. We should just feel grateful for the sperm, right? Sorry, man. Done with you, sorry. Good night, everybody. Drive safe. (birds chirp) (door knocks) (birds chirp) Hey. - Oh my god, what happened? Should I hold your arm? - No, I'm okay, thank you. - Okay. Do you want to talk about it? - I really can't. - We could have a conversation. - Why do you think this kind of thing keeps happening? - I don't know. - Maybe you do. - I don't. - Well, okay-- - Don't talk about it, please, bitch. (Stephen cries) I don't know. It just, it just-- - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yes-- - It's. - Yeah. - Let it all out, that's amazing. (Stephen cries) What's, what should I, do you want me to do something? Like, what should I do, do you want to make a list? (Stephen sighs) Do you want to hear my song? - Sure. ♪ I can't get out of bed ♪ ♪ I can't get out of this bed ♪ ♪ Why do I feel this way ♪ ♪ Is it because of ♪ ♪ Daddy ♪ (Stephen laughs) Yeah? - Yep. - There you go. - It's good. - It's pretty good, isn't it? - It's good. - Just came to me on the bus. (Stephen laughs) (slow piano music) (moves into slow orchestral music) (audience applauds) - Cheers. (Benjamin claps) (speaking in foreign language) - Oh, it was so good, it was so good, well done, oh. (speaking in foreign language) - [Adrienne] You played so beautifully, it was lovely. - Thank you, Mama. - [Claude] And how is the band doing? - Good, good, we have a, we have a gig tomorrow, so it's good. - [Claude] Have you found a way to make any money with it? - But, like, the band are actually, they're so, so good, I mean, there was, I actually saw the band before we met, so I knew nothing about him beforehand, so good, and then, and then we met, and yeah, you're so good, like, honestly. Just a really talented bunch of people. - And you are so very creative, aren't you? Noah said that you write films? - [Paul] Yeah. - [Adrienne] Do you? - Oh, yeah, he does. - Yeah. Oh my god. Sorry. - What is it? - No, it's okay, it's cool-- - No, it's okay, it's just that my ex is here, it was just, it's, that's fine, it's, it's fine, I mean, he's fun. This'll be fun for us, I can, or maybe I should go over and say hello before he sees me, or maybe I should, Paul, hi. - Hi. - [Benjamin] How are you? Are they new glasses? - No. - They're lovely, this is Noah, and Adrienne and Claude, this is Paul. - [Adrienne] Hi, Paul. - Hi. - So is this, is this you meeting the parents? - A bit, we just saw, Noah just graduated from Guildhall. - Of course he did, congratulations. - Thanks. - So what are you, how are you? - Yeah, I'm fine, I heard you wrote a film about me and cast a white guy. - The last film that I did, it was about a relationship, and it was slightly inspired by Paul, but it was mainly about me being an idiot. But, anyway, thank you, thanks, Enrique. Sorry, this is Enrique, Paul, Paul, Enrique, Enrique, Paul. What's going on, are you in love? - Am I in, am I in love? - Have a breadstick, why wouldn't you want a breadstick. - 'Cause you're not really offering me - [Claude] Okay, well, boys, it was lovely to meet you. - Sorry, sorry, who are you? - This is Claude, should we-- - I'm sorry, you write a film about me, and then you fuck the guy that plays me, - Okay, should we, can you take (mumbles)? - [Claude] I think that's a really good idea. - Okay, you need to chill out, Claude. Good luck, mate, hopefully it won't be two years followed by a shit film about how much of a cunt you are. - He's in fashion. Paul. What was that? - What? - Oh, oh, was that embarrassing? Why do you surround yourself with all these stupid children? - Noah's French, I like him, I like him. - Oh, 'cause it's easy. It's safe. How long are you gonna keep doing this? - [Benjamin] I don't know. - You're gonna end up alone, you're gonna end up unhappy. - I know this, I've written this, you're saying words I've actually written. - Because you're still doing the same thing. Have some pride in yourself, what do you think I was with you, it wasn't a fetish. - [Benjamin] Well, how much of that was about what I do? - We were together two years, your work isn't that good. - Okay, I think I'm gonna go back inside-- - But what are you gonna do, Ben? Are you gonna adopt him? I just, I just wanted to mean something to you, that's all. - What, I, you did, you did. - Okay. Do what you want, it's not me who's never gonna feel anything. (silverware clinks) - I'm back. I think in the future that'll all seem quite funny. (slow piano music) I think I'm gonna end up hurting you. - What do you mean? Maybe I hurt you. Hey, what happened? You just had a bit of a shock, yeah? - Oh, god, please, don't look so sad, I can't take it. Please. What can I do to make this not so awful? - Just talk to me, you know. - [Benjamin] I'm sorry, I don't, I can't. - You can't what? You want me to go? - I don't know. I don't know. - You don't know? Okay. Okay. - One way to be happy is to enjoy being sad, understand that. (children shriek) - [Announcer] A new contemporary piece by Anna Block called Womb. (audience applauds) (bell rings) (slow ambient music) (audience applauds) - It was incredible. (audience applauds) - Yeah, man, that was great. - Yeah, that made me think about life and shit. - Anna. Fuck, that was amazing, I mean, I-- - Thank you. - You've met Ben, right? - Hi, yeah, congratulations, that was, it was, how did you come up with it, with all the paper? - Just came together over the year. - Year, no, was that, was that the last time that you were doing it, or will you need more paper? - [Anna] That was it. - Well, good, good, well, otherwise, that's a lot of paper all the time, isn't it? Like, where'd you get such big paper? - I'm sorry, I'm really exhausted-- - Seriously, everything you just did, it was the truth. (Benjamin laughs) - No, no, no, yeah, that's, I know, yeah, the truth. I'm laughing 'cause it's true. - Okay, I'll see you later. - Yeah. That was so fucking rude. - [Harry] I'm gonna go see if she's okay. - She's fine. What are you doing? - I think I'm gonna go-- - Don't leave me here on my own, just stay here until Harry gets back, okay? - Okay. - Do you hate me? (slow music) (Benjamin laughs) - I've.
