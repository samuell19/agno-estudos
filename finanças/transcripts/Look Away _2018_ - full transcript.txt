(MUSIC CONTINUES) (GIRLS LAUGHING) (WHISTLE BLOWING) Hold this. MALE STUDENT: Clear the ice! HOCKEY PLAYER: Lily! What are you doin'? Get off! Come on, bro! Sean... what the hell, man?! We're in the middle... Let's go! Sean, come on, man! So, honey, um, guess who I ran into today. Sue, George's mother... do you remember George? You went to science camp with him. He was he smart kid. I don't remember. Curious George, that's what you called him. Anyway, he remembers you very fondly from science camp. - So, I was thinking that maybe... - No. Um, Maria, you don't even know what I was going to say next. Just... don't. Fine, if you don't want to hear the rest of what... - I was gonna say, that's fine. - No, she does. You know your mother's trying to be helpful, right? Right? Yes. Here was my idea, just that you're here and George... is here and and you both like each other... so the winter prom is coming up, you could go to it together. - I'm not going to the prom. - Why not? Because it's stupid and I don't want any part of it. But it's such a beautiful tradition. You're really gonna be missing out, it's your senior year. Missing out on what?! That went well. I guess she just needs time to come out of her shell. Christ, Amy, she's nearly 18. Well, she's a late bloomer. - She has no friends. - She's friends with Lily. Lily's a habit, not a friend. She has no social life. She has no confidence. As far as I'm aware... she's never even had a conversation with a boy. She doesn't touch her food. She weighs less than she did two years ago. Wake up, Amy! Just look at her! Look at her! DAN: We have a screwed-up daughter. AMY: You're too hard on her... you just need to give her time to blossom. DAN: Blossom into what? (DOOR OPENS) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC FADES UP) (MOANS) (EERIE MUSIC FADES UP) (EERIE MUSIC CONTINUES) Hey, sweetie. Dad, um.... - Mm-hm? - Last night... I don't really know what to make of it... but I... I just wanted to ask you something. Did you get any sleep? Yeah, I... well, I mean... I mean, no I didn't sleep well last night. You look terrible. You sure you wanna go to school looking like that? What? Honey, look, I know it's a jungle out there... but you gotta put your best face forward. - Don't you wanna look your best? - I do, but I... What's going on? She didn't get any sleep... again. Look, a good night's sleep is essential for all of us... but particularly for a young girl who's growing. Why don't you do yourself a favor? Hop upstairs, put some make-up on. You'll look better and you'll feel better. Promise you, trust me. But her omelette will get all cold. We both know she's not gonna eat the omelette. Go on, upstairs. Honey, what's wrong? Sweetie, go... now. Never mind. (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (CAR HORN HONKING) Good morning. Hey. So, what do you think? - It's nice. - Nice? Okay, it's... it's really nice. Nice is a boy you don't wanna go out with. This is an acid green, turbo-charged 911. This is definitely not nice. (MUSIC PLAYING) Woo! Woohoo! Woo! - (HORN HONKING) - SEAN: Yeah, I'm coming! SEAN: Whoa. Sorry, Maria. Sweet ride. Hey, baby. ♪ And it feels like ♪ (INDISTINCT CHATTER) That's not funny. Are you okay? I'm so sorry. I really didn't mean to do that. STUDENT: Maybe she should watch where she's going. You all right? Wow, Sean, your bar has really lowered, huh? You fuck with...! Oy! Chill! Back up, Paul. - Hey, baby, it's not worth it. - Fuckin' punk. - See you at practice. - Seriously? STUDENT: Little bitch! Light's out! - You okay? - Yeah. - Should we go? - Okay. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CHANGES) (BABY CRIES) AIRAM (V.O.): Maria. AIRAM (V.O.): Maria. You're not real. I'm imagining you. Why am I seeing you? Because I'm here. Who... who are you? You don't remember me? - I don't know you. - I've always been here. Look in the window... I'm everywhere where you are. Whenever you see yourself, what you really see is me. How long have you been here? How long have you? - What do you want? - What do you want? What do you want from me? I can take your sadness away. Listen, I'm here for you, I know you. I know your secret desires, your fears... who you love, who you hate. I understand you completely. - But you aren't me? - No. - Who are you then? - Look at me. - What? - Look at me. What do you see? I s... I see what I look like. What do you look like? I... you're beautiful. We are beautiful. Do you have a name? Airam. Airam. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Hey. Honey, you lookin' really good today. Yeah, I see it, you had your beauty sleep, I can tell. - Yeah. - Mm-hm. Good for you, honey. Um, I've decided I'm gonna go to the winter prom after all. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. Honey, that's wonderful. So who's the lucky guy? - No one. - No one yet. You know, the main thing is that she's going. Right? Which is great. You're making an effort to be part of something. MARIA: Hey, Lily. Hey, are we gonna hit the ice today? You wanna learn how to skate? Yeah, I'm teaching her for winter prom. Oh, that's great, who are you going with? No one... yet. So are we gonna skate today or...? Oh shit, no, um, it's Thursday. I have that bonding date with my dad. You Brennans are so weird. You don't know the half of it. LILY: Okay, well, tomorrow then? Tomorrow. She wants to learn how to skate? - Yeah, you wanna teach her? - No. It's just not like her, that's all. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) He's just with a patient, take a seat, darling. - He'll be right out. - Okay. Okay. That's 278. And this one is... 286. - May I? - Yes. Thank you. What we're gonna do is we are going to relocate... your nipples back up here where they belong. Slip an implant under here and here... and they are gonna be perky and perfect. NAOMI: So how's school, Maria? It's good. You're lucky to be in high school. I miss that time so much. No worries, all you care about are guys, right? Naomi, could you go through the forms with Ms. Robinson, please? And schedule a mammoplasty... and an abdominoplasty for a few weeks. Hey, hun... hi. - Hi. - Claudia. Do we have an appointment today? No, I just wanted to see if it's coming along okay. Please? I really can't today, my daughter's here for a date. You're here early, aren't you? Did we not say 6:00? Yeah, sorry. Can't you squeeze me in for like ten minutes? Why don't I just check it right now? Here we go. All right, here we go. That is looking just fine. (MOVIE PLAYING) ACTOR: I'll remember you just like this. ACTRESS: Yeah. (KISSING, MOANING) ACTOR: I thought this weekend would never come. ACTRESS: Me, too. I love you so much. ACTOR: I love you, too. Are you okay, honey? Yeah. - Oh. - Hey. Maria, hey, oh, what's good? I don't think we've ever met before, you must be Dr. Brennan. - And you are? - Mark. It's a pleasure to meet you, Doctor. MARK: I'm actually considering going into pre-med myself. I'd love to sit down with you, pick your brain sometime... if that wouldn't be too much trouble. Sure. Great, and Maria, I guess I'll just see you around in school. (SNICKERING) That was brutal. You know, your birthday's coming up in a couple months. What would you say to getting your gift... a little early this year? I... I'd say yes. Swing by the office tomorrow after school. Sure. Daddy. What? Never mind. (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING) You really believe he cares, don't you? - He does. - Oh, come on, Maria. He was embarrassed, that's all. You're just a stain on his family. No, you're wrong. He does care and he's gonna buy me my car early... because he doesn't want me riding the bus... with those idiots anymore. - You heard him. - I heard him. What do you know anyway? Nothing that you don't already. Shh. DAN: You know, you're overreacting, okay? You ready? Is it in there? Come on. It's here. What? I know who you see in the mirror. It doesn't matter what's real. What matters is how you feel... and I wanna make you feel beautiful. I'm your dad, think I don't know why you don't wear your hair... back in a ponytail? Hm. So, here's what I'm gonna do. Take this, which is eight millimeters... and this, which is six. We're gonna round the top of these pointy bits off... and they're gonna be amazing. Then, here, lift 'em. I know. Yeah, we're gonna take this sweet, little snub nose... we're just gonna slim down the cartilage at the top... and just extend the tip a teeny bit. It's gonna look sophisticated and amazing... and we're gonna accentuate the cupid's bow... show those fabulous teeth... and let that smile come shining through. And that's my gift to you. Say yes. - Yes. - Yeah? Mm-hm. Let's go eat. (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) You were right. You have no one taking care of you out there. Well, there's Mom. She's weak. She'll do everything he tells her, and you know why. Because she still thinks he gives a shit about her. That's right. God, they really are something. Aren't they? Hm. I mean, he doesn't give a fuck and she... Desperately needs one. Mom, don't you know you're supposed to knock? (GIGGLES) - Who were you talking to? - No one. - I just heard you! - It's no one. I thought of something funny. Are you smoking pot in here? What are you doing? What's wrong with you? (MARIA GIGGLING) Maybe she was on the phone. No! I w... I was in there with her! It was as though there was someone else there... in the room with her and she was laughing strangely... and I tried to get through to her, but I couldn't. - Okay, okay. Ssh-ssh... okay. - Are you listening to me, Dan? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm listening to you. She has problems, okay? We know this. - No, but... - This is not news. Oh, come on. I don't need that. That's not... Please hear me out. Please! I have a very strong feeling about this. - You're having a panic attack. - If you would've seen this... - Amy! Amy! - I'm not! I'm not! Amy, stop, breathe. Let me help you. Open up. Drink up... look. Okay, now get your breath back, it's gonna be alright. Everything's gonna be alright. You know why? AMY: Why? 'Cause I know what I'm doing and I'm taking care of it. - Do you believe me? - Yeah. Okay. Ssh-ssh. Alright. Ssh. They've come back. The dreams? Well, they'll go away, they always do. But then they always come back. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC FADES UP) Oh, the old club house. We haven't been here since we were like four. Yeah, no one really comes now that it's closed. It's a shame, it's really pretty. Yeah. - Should we put these on? - Okay. LILY: That's it! That's it! Now, I'm gonna let go of you, okay? No, Lily, wait. Don't. Please. We're just gonna go to the club house, it's fine. - Okay? - No. No, no, no, no, no. Don't. Don't. Don't. Look at me. You're gonna have to do it on your own eventually. You can't hold on to me forever. - Okay. - Okay? That's it, come on. Head up! Head up! No, I can't, I can't do this. Ow! Lily, come on, help me up. - He's mine, you know? - What? Who? You know who I'm talking about. No, I don't. Where are you going? Lily! Lily, come on! Lily! You wanna believe in it, don't you? What? That she's your friend, that she cares about you. She is my friend. But you're not so sure of that now, are you? We've been best friends since we were three. I was there too, remember? I remember when she left you alone in the sand box. All alone, by yourself... because she wanted to play with the other girls. That never happened. I was there when you made a pact not to sit next to each other... on the first day of grade school. No, she was late that day. - The teacher seated her next to... - No! She was there before you arrived, Maria... sitting next to little Chloe... acting like she didn't know who you were. And poor little you, you were there... in your little, pink dress... because she told you it made you look as pretty as a princess. You didn't remember that, did you? But I do, I remember all of those moments. I remember when she'd laugh behind your back... and roll her eyes when you weren't looking. I remember all of those things. All of those things that you choose to forget. Just like you wanted to forget her leaving you... lying on the ice today. No. No. No. But I won't let you forget, Maria... because that's what real friends do. They share their pain. And you have so much inside of you. But I can take all of those feelings away. Trust me, and you trust in yourself. Let me help you, be there for you... instead of you. Come on. I can fix things. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Give me your other hand. Kiss me. (KNOCK ON DOOR) AMY: Maria? Yeah, Mom? AMY: I have a surprise for you. Open up. This is your time to shine. Look. Look at you, like an angel. Honey, I want you to promise me something, okay? Will you promise me that you will have a good time? Can you promise me that? AMY: Please, darling, please promise me. I promise.

I was just giving Maria her pin back. See ya. Are you okay? I'm so sorry about what happened last night. That was... it was fucking wrong. - Was it? - Yeah, it was shameful. Is that what you felt? Shame? Hey, look, I didn't do anything wrong. Okay? - I tried to stop them, but... - Sure. You're not quitting on me now, are you? Quitting? You said you were gonna teach me to skate.

Did we have a lunch date or something? Did I forget anything or...? Huh... okay, so? I missed you. That's nice. And I... I missed you, too.

We'll let him know you're coming. I took the liberty of throwing in some marshmallows. Mm. Thank you, oh, and I almost forgot!

Okay... oh, in an hour. Okay, great, see you, yeah okay, thanks. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) That's a pretty dress. Oh, thank you, it's Dr. Dan's favorite. Where's Daddy? - Is he working late? - Mm. Is he working late? Probably, yes. Uh, how's the tofu steak? It doesn't even look like you've touched it. It's just like your marriage. What? A stale imitation of the real thing. Have you lost your mind? Where's Dad? I just told you. He's probably got some extra procedures... and he's going to be at the office late. Please stop smiling at me like that. Why don't you tell the truth? It's so liberating. Try it. Dad is not working late. See? What are you talking about? - Say it. - AMY: Say what? Just say that you're tired... of him fucking all those other women. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me, I'm so sorry. I'm not. AIRAM: What are you looking at? MARIA: What do you think you're doing? AIRAM: Having dinner with Mom. Why were you so mean to her? - AIRAM: Was I lying? - No. Am I not doing what you've always wanted to do? Saying what you've always wanted to say? Everything you didn't dare. Maybe. It's about time for the truth to surface, isn't it? I guess. Just follow me, stop resisting. She deserves it, they all do. It's time they learned that. - Learned what? - That they've sinned. Against who? Against who?!

Please hurry. We still have a couple questions for your daughter. Well, can it wait? I mean, she's been through so much. Sure. We'll stay in touch. Thank you. Why are you doing this? Because you wanted me to. I don't. Do you hear me?! I don't! I want you back here behind the glass, back where you belong. I want out. I want out! Did you really want me to risk our lives to save hers? Hm? Save? You pushed her to it. I didn't touch her. That's right, accidents happen. She brought this on herself. I didn't want this to happen. Can you look at me and sincerely say... you want her back in your life? Good. There are no lies between us. Remember, I'm doing all of this for you. For us. Wait. Who are you? You know me. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) MAN: I'm sorry for your loss. - Hey. - Hey. Where are you going? Home. I really can't... Handle it?

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (PHONE VIBRATES) Something for the pain? I didn't know you smoked weed. I do now. I just can't believe she's gone. I keep waiting for her to come back and tell me... it's all just some kind of sick joke or something. Stupid, isn't it? You're just sad, that's all. I know how that feels. Sometimes I think it's all I know. (CRYING) Are you okay? Are you crying? I have a confession to make. What? All of those times when I was with you and Lily... I'd look at her and I'd just think, what would it be like... if it were you touching my hair, kissing my lips? And then, when I was alone with myself... I'd touch myself... and I'd imagine your hand touching me all over. Stop. And I'd get so hot thinking about it. Stop it. Maria... don't, it's wrong. Stop it. I can't stop now, Sean. Feel me. (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (LOUNGE MUSIC PLAYING) One special som tam salad. Mm. - WAITER: You like? - Mm-hm. WAITER: Not many Americans order this dish. They don't know what they're missing. WAITER: Bon appétit. Thank you. It's good to see you enjoy your food. I'm enjoying everything now, Daddy. So, how are you feeling? I mean, after the accident. Oh, I'm good. - You're good? - Mm-hm. It was only a couple days ago. - You two were so close. - Not anymore. Daddy, are you ever coming back home? It's complicated. Your mom and I, um, we have problems. But it's nothing you can't fix, right? That's what you do best, fix things. Yeah... I try. Honey. Hey, clean yourself up. What are you doing? Sit in your chair. Sit in your chair properly. Cheers. What do you see? Hm? You see a sophisticated, young woman? Do you? A fiery, independent spirit? An adult? Is that what you see? 'Cause I'll tell you what I see. I see a little girl trying way too hard and looking pathetic. Now sit in your goddamn chair. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) So at the base of the well... Dante finds himself within a large, frozen lake. It's Cocytus, the ninth circle of hell. Entrapped in the ice, he finds the sinners guilty... of treacheries against those... who with they had special relationships. Now, as Ciardi writes, the treacheries of these souls... were denials of love and of all human warmth. As they denied human ties... so were they bound by the unyielding ice. All right, round one, Caina, named after? Not everyone at once. It was Cain, surprise, surprise. And he killed his own brother in the first act of murder... that's Genesis 4:8. Now this roundhouse is the kindreds... to their to their treacheries. So they're allowed to have their heads and necks above the ice... and they're allowed to bow just to prevent themselves...

Of course, you are, now get dressed. Just, whatever is happening, I want you to stop it now, Maria. - Would you love me if I wasn't? - What? Would you love me if I wasn't beautiful? - If I was deformed? - What? - Why would you say that? - Would you? Just put that on, please, I'm asking nicely, please. Put this on, okay? Put it on! Please, put it on. Look at me, Daddy. All right. See me. Yes. Yes, I would. Okay? (CHOKING) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Why couldn't you love me? Why couldn't you just love me? Maria? Maria? Maria?
