GIVE ME YOUR HAND - Did we get lost? - No, I know where we are. I've got a hole in my shoe. Do you want to go there or not? Wait for me. You're walking too fast. It was your idea. Do you think I like leaving dad alone with all the work? He's from Spain. "The car is in the auto shop." "The bottle is standing on the table." Hello! Who are you? My name is Antoine. And yours? I'm Quentin. I'm going to Pasalla, in the north of Spain. And you? I go... up your ass. My tummy is hurting. I'm sick. - No, thanks. - Quick, I'm burning my fingers. - Thank you. - Thanks, Cl?mentine. Next time you forget my name, it's going to cost you. Come on, she is giving us a lift! In the back, moron! You can't... Put the cookies back where you got them! - You're staying here! - Let me go or else... You're nuts! Asshole! Wait! I'm coming with you. Cool, there's even a mattress here. Thank you, Ma'am. Take care. Maybe we'll meet again someday. - We'll take a shortcut through the woods. - Through the woods? Very funny. You don't even know where we are. Can I come with you? You won't notice I'm there. And I stole lots of cookies at the gas station. Where are you going to? To Spain. To our mom's funeral. We never got to know her. Okay. I'll look for a place to sleep before it gets dark. When I started working at the gas station, I had a boyfriend... but he broke up with me. Always having to pay road charges when he wanted to see me pissed him off. I wouldn't have minded that. You have even less money. I've got to pee. And then with my brother... You would've been gone pretty quickly. Would you like to see my drawings? I can't find him. Don't worry, he'll be back. What it's like to be twins? - Are you exactly the same in everything? - You think my brother is cute, don't you? For you, I'd even pick the moon. I bet that line's pretty successful in a club, isn't it? I want to share everything with you. We could start with the cookies. What? - Quiet... - What's up? - There's a boar over there. It's looking at us. It's attacking us! - Where? I don't see anything. - Here! Idiot. Stop it. Why? That's not me, that's the boar. And your brother? Where are you going? No, that's the last one. Travelling with your brother, that must be nice. Great. When I call, you'll bring the boxes inside. Have we got any water left? We should've stolen his car! I'm thirsty. I'm hungry. We should take a train. Do you have money? No, but maybe we could work for one or two days. You want to work? I'm so fed up with your stupid ideas. Do whatever you want to. I'll go on walking. You're a free person! Piss off, man! When it came to saying good-bye to dad, you're weren't that cocky. You piss off yourself! No, I don't need anyone. And besides, I don't have a place where you could sleep. We could share a bed. He's working just as hard as I am. Pears and a golden globe, two children in a garden... Pear, where is Mommy? I don't know... Come, give me your hand... Where are we going? I don't know... Come... Dad's got a deep voice. Will I sound like him? I don't know... Come, give me your hand... Peach, grandma, she's laughing a lot... Do you think she's happy? I don't know... Come, give me your hand... Hey, bro! We can switch places. It's easier on the trailer. - Go to your brother. - No, I'm fine, thanks. My first week, I was on the trailer all the time because my hands were hurting. You really don't want to? - Don't you smoke? - Not today. You are really pissed off, eh? It's hard for me too. Every summer the same shit. A month without my girlfriend, you know... It's funny, you and your brother are totally different. Yeah. Antoine's the one who has many friends. Do you want to be left alone? I'd like to draw you. Come with me. I wanna show you something. - You go first. - I'll wait here, no problem. What are you doing? If we don't go now, we'll never get to the funeral. But we don't have enough money yet for two tickets. - Where are you going? - I've got to pee. Are you and your brother looking for a place to sleep? No. But if you're interested in my brother... no problem. 100 euros. Pay me. Just go to him, he's waiting for you. He is expensive, your brother. For that money, I could have you both. Just him. He likes these things. What are you doing? Come with me! Come on! Ah, you like playing hard-to-get. Fuck, I paid for this! Let me go! I did pay your brother 100 Euros. Did I talk in my sleep? A bit. I do that pretty often. My brother is worse, he walks. He walks in his sleep. This one time, he went down the stairs to the bakery. He stopped in front of the big oven. He went closer and closer to the fire. I didn't do anything. Didn't say anything, I was just looking. Then my father turned around. He slapped him in the face to wake him up. I was lucky he didn't see me. He was really mad. I don't know why I didn't call out. l... ...was all alone. So I... ...made up a sister. A little sister. I did... We did... ...lots of things together. We loved each other. But... ...she wasn't real. Quentin? Quentin! Hi, buddy. Where are you going to? Are you okay? Are you feeling okay? Where do you go? To Pasalla. You're French. Pasalla. Who's going there? Grandpa, that's Antonio. Our travel companion. He's French. Do you remember when we went to Paris with mom? Okay, Antonio. It won't take long. Antonio. Hey, Antonio. Amigo. Is everything ok? Do you know where you are? Stay calm. Relax, buddy, I just want to help you. I looked for you all over the train. The train? Where did you get that jacket? I thought you had gone back home. You need me too much for that, moron. I found the cemetery without your help. You've got to go back home now. Dad is waiting for you. Get up! Wake up! Source translation unknown. Corrections by SmallBrother
