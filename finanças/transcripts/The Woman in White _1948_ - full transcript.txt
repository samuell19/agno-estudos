[ Walter Hartright narrates: ] "I came to Limmeridge seven years ago." "The night of April 4th 1851." "The air was full of Springtime and train smoke." "Otherwise, a night like any other night." "I'd hoped the Fairlies would send a carriage for me." Good evening. - Good evening. I was expecting a carriage from the Limmeridge house. The trap was here to meet the afternoon train. I missed the connection at Newbury. Is there any way of getting there at this time of night? There's walking. You can leave your baggage here if you like. It's only about half an hour with the moon on your shoulder like it is. Would you be kind enough to show me the way? There you are sir, you uh .. You take the pike road there and follow your nose straight through the village. You'll be passing the school house on your left. Stay by the road for about a mile until you near the woods and the marshalling. It's a lonely stretch but you have got a good light for it. Sir! Did you .. speak to me? I am .. I'm afraid I'm lost. Could you tell me what road this is? It's all so .. different in the dark. It's the main pike. It runs by Limmeridge house and then on a few miles to Newbury. Is that sufficient? Yes .. thank you. Did I pass you in the darkness? I didn't see you. No. I was hiding. Then I saw you light your pipe. You seemed kind, and I thought you might help me. Are you ill? Who are you? What have they told you about me? Madam, I've only just arrived. I'm a painter. The new drawing master at Limmeridge house. Limmeridge? You be at Limmeridge House? Oh, how wonderful. I live there too sometimes. - Oh? Just pretending, I mean. Only in fun. Do you know Mrs Fairlie? Miss Laura Fairlie's mother? Her parents are dead, aren't they? I try to make myself think she was my mother too. She really isn't you know. Mrs Fairlie was the most wonderful person in the world. She's the one who dressed me in white. What is it? Did you see someone? Tell me, what is it? Walk on and leave me. Please, don't ask me anything, but leave me. They mustn't see me. They mustn't! Calm yourself, there's no need for alarm. Can you help us, my friend? Have you walked out from the village? - Yes I have. Well then, have you by any chance passed a woman coming this way along the road? A woman? Yes, young rather. White dress no doubt. Maybe a cloak. I'm afraid I can be of no help to you. Is someone missing? - Most unfortunately. We've reason to believe she's in Limmeridge somewhere. The poor creature escaped last night from a private asylum over Newbury way. Asylum? Very well, Thomas. Goodnight, sir. Hello there! [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] Mr Hartright? - Yes. Oh do come in, sir. We didn't expect you so late. We're very sorry that the carriage wasn't at the station to meet you. We understood that you were to arrive much earlier. Mr Hartright, Miss Marian. Mr Hartright, I'm Marian Halcombe, Miss Fairlie's cousin and companion. I'm sorry to say she's retired. And Mr Frederick Fairlie's usually too indisposed to receive anyone. I couldn't ask for a more charming welcome than yours, madam. I'm afraid my late arrival has inconvenienced you. Oh no, not at all. We weren't expecting you until tomorrow once you weren't on the afternoon train. It was a fine night. I found the walk very interesting. You might prepare some supper for Mr Hartright, Jepson. Will it take long? Only a few minutes, Miss Marian. We'll wait in the breakfast room, then. Perhaps I can explain your arduous duties .. And something about us all while we have a moment. I shall be all attention, Miss Halcombe. Let me see, with whom shall I begin? With yourself, perhaps? Let me give the family a better start than that. I'll begin with Laura, my exact opposite. She's an angel. I'm not. She's heiress to a large fortune. I'm as poor as a field-mouse. She's pretty, gay, charming. As feminine as this. But, different as we are, Mr Hartright. She can't live without me, and I can't live without her. So, in order to please one of us .. you must please both. There's Laura's old nurse, Mrs Vesey. She's more of a presence than a person. She just sits. And Mr Frederick Fairlie is too much of an invalid to leave his own quarters. He's an uncle. And head of the house as he's the last Fairlie of his generation. So, there you have us sir, such as we are. Oh! Oh, back already? Did you enjoy your walk? As well as a man could. A walk alone in the moonlight leaves something to be desired. Don't you agree, young sir? Oh, this is Mr Hartright, our new drawing-master. Count Fosco. Have you seen Fairlie yet? Is he in a good mood? Count Fosco came up from London on the afternoon train. You might have met. This poor man walked all the way from the station. Jepson's preparing some supper to restore him. Supper? Splendid idea. I'll join you immediately. Count Fosco likes to clown but don't be fooled. He's one of the most brilliant critics and scientists in Italy. Our friend, Sir Percival Glyde .. Met him there and brought him to us when he came to England. Now he comes often, to help Mr Fairlie with his etchings and rare coins. But you're about to ask me about your employer, Frederick Fairlie. Please don't. Your own impressions must be your only guide. Oh, but dear Fosco's another matter. Not only is he learned and charming. But he's gifted with the most voracious appetite I've ever beheld. Nothing more beneficial than a tasty meal before retiring, Mr Hartright. It's the natural intimacy between eating and sleeping. Too often neglected in our over-civilized existence. An intimacy not only biologically sound. But aesthetically delightful. Won't you have a tart Mr Hartright? While you have a chance. Perhaps I'd better. As for me, I perform both these delightful functions .. Less from necessity than for the purest pleasure. Wisdom I've tried to impress on Miss Halcombe here. Who is inclined to take too much on her exquisite shoulders. As you're a man of taste, Mr Hartright, I'm sure you will have noticed them. Another of the pure pleasures in which Count Fosco indulges .. Is the constant embarrassment of a guileless young woman. Goodnight, gentlemen. Jepson will show you to your rooms. So, you are a drawing-master Mr Hartright? I'm a painter .. I give drawing lessons. I saw several canvases when I was in Paris recently .. Which were a positive revelation. As if a painter had carried his easel out into sunlight for the first time. His picture became drenched in it. Indeed, it's a pleasure to find someone here who is so interested. It is more than I'd hoped. A mutual pleasure young sir, I myself have no gifts. But do appreciate the gifts of others. I understand you had the good fortune to be forced to walk out from the village. A piece of luck on a night like this. Yes, it was uh .. very pleasant. No doubt, no doubt. A young man is apt to stumble on any sort of adventure. Under the magic of moonlight. No, I was not that fortunate. But I enjoy walking. One never knows. One only hopes. Goodnight, young sir. - Goodnight, sir. Mr Fairlie has just sent word that he would be glad to see you tonight, sir. If you're not too tired. - No, not at all. A bite of supper has restored me completely. I had no idea Mr Fairlie was such an invalid. He isn't exactly what you'd call an invalid, sir. I thought Mr Fairlie had retired. His hours are irregular. He never leaves his rooms, you know. He said he would be unable to sleep with the interview hanging over him. This is Mr Hartright, Louis. Mr Hartright, sir. Oh, I am so happy to possess you at Limmeridge Mister .. Hartright. - Hartright. Won't you sit down. But don't trouble to move the chair. In the wretched state of my nerves .. Movement of any kind is exquisitely painful to me. Have they welcomed you properly? - Most graciously, sir. Pray excuse me. Could you speak in a slightly lower key? Loud sound is an indescribable torture to me. You will pardon an invalid .. But I only say to you what my lamentable health forces me to say to all. Thank you so much. Do proceed. Miss Halcombe has been very kind. - Oh, I'm so glad. Would you mind putting this tray of coins .. Over in that cabinet? And handing me the one next to it. Thank you. The wretched state of my nerves makes exertion of any kind .. Extremely disagreeable to me. Oh, thank you, thank you. A thousand thanks and apologies. Aren't they beautiful. Do you like coins, Mister ..? Hartright. - Hartright. I'm so glad. That means we have another taste in common besides our respect for art. Oh yes. About the pecuniary arrangements my steward made with you. Are they satisfactory? I'm so glad. Was there anything else? I thought. Oh, yes. Would you mind just touching the bell for me please? Gently .. gently. Oh watch what you're doing! Would you straighten it again, please. I'm so sorry Mr Hartright. So sorry. These tormenting nerves quite rob me of any control. Won't you sit down again? You see, the picture needs a slight change. I couldn't bear anyone. Especially you a painter, Mr Hartright, to see it before it's finished. What would you think of my taste? Oh Louis, that portfolio please. Oh no, not the one with the green back. That contains my Rembrandt etchings. The one with the red back, Louis. Don't drop it all. Don't drop it! Have you any idea the tortures I should suffer Mr Hartright .. If Louis were to drop that portfolio? Ha ha ha! Is it safe on that chair? Do you think it's safe, Mr Hartright? I'm so glad you think so. Will you oblige me by looking through the etchings? You'll probably find one of them .. Louis, go away! You're a dunce! Do tell me what you think of them. I thought they smelt of horrid dealer's fingers when I handled them last. Can you do anything with them? They require careful stringing and mounting, but in my opinion sir, I .. Pardon me, Mr Hartright, but .. Do you mind if I close my eyes while you speak? Even this subdued light can be an agony. Thank you. Do go on. I was about to say .. I will string and mount them. Perhaps, the only point still to discuss .. Is the instruction and sketching I am engaged to give your niece. Oh yes. My niece knows enough of your charming art to be aware of her own sad defects. So you will take pains with her, won't you? Is there anything else now that we quite understand one another, don't we? Oh, so nice to have settled a critic. Oh Mr Hartright. Would you mind asking Louis to carry the portfolio to your room? I'm not speaking to him, I'm cross with him. Indignation upsets one so, doesn't it? Yes, I quite agree with you. I can carry it myself. Can you really? Oh, how nice to be so strong. Are you sure you won't drop it? Louis. Louis, come here. It's alright, I've quite forgiven you. You may approach me quietly. Louis, the 12th-century Crown Of Lorenzo is missing! It's absolutely priceless you know, but I'm denied the privilege of excitement. Oh. You couldn't have seen it anywhere could you, Mr Hartright? No, of course not. How could you? Only, that nobody else has been here. Count Fosco was working on the tray, sir. Fosco! Oh! Dear oh dear. I knew it. I knew it. Ah! Don't let me get excited, Louis. You know how Count Fosco affects me. Oh, go away! Oh, there it is. Well, Louis, have I got to ask you to pick up the Crown Of Lorenzo? Goodnight Mr Hartright. You will take care with the etchings, won't you. Thank you. And you will not let the doors bang. Oh, gently with the curtains, please! The slightest rustle from them goes through me like a knife. I'm so grateful to you, Mr Hartright. Good evening. Ah .. Now Louis, you may get me ready for bed. I can show you your rooms now, sir. We'll send to the station for your luggage first thing in the morning, sir. Thank you. I can bring you some toilet things in the meantime. Is there anything else, sir? No thank you. You may tell Mister Fairlie my quarters are satisfactory. Yes sir. Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight. Ah! Ooh! Hurt yourself? Oh .. it's just a thorn. So clumsy of me. - I don't think it's very serious. I know. The hawthorn is worth it. It is so beautiful. Do you think you might be free of such accidents and fears in the dark if .. You returned to where you came from? I'm afraid I don't know you, sir. Perhaps you don't recognize me in daylight. But we surely met on the road last night. What became of you? Why evidently you've made some mistake. My name is Laura Fairlie. In that case Miss Fairlie, I must be wrong. But the resemblance is so striking I can hardly believe it. Even now. Well I .. I find all this a little embarrassing. I don't know you and I've no idea what you are talking about. I'm the new drawing-master Miss Fairlie. Walter Hartright. Oh. I was walking out from the village to Limmeridge House last night. And a young woman appeared in the dark road. She asked for my help. She was dressed entirely in white. Rather strangely but .. Are you quite sure you are not ..? I'm sure I've never seen you before, sir. Come Mr Hartright. We must hurry home or Marian and Fosco will have eaten all the breakfast. And since I see you are so determined. On the way, you may tell all about this romantic adventure of yours. Good morning. - Morning. Look at them. Aren't they beautiful? Mr Hartright says he's never seen such hawthorns. In your arms my dear, neither have I. - Oh you. Now you see why we had to hurry. They haven't left us a bite no doubt. Thank you, Jepson. Oh Mrs Vesey, this is Mr Hartright. How do you do. - How do you do. Good morning everybody. - Good morning. You know Mrs Vesey, Mr Hartright is much nicer than we expected. I'm scarcely frightened of him at all. I see you've lost no time in beginning your instruction, Mr Hartright. I advise you to have nothing to do with the cold ham, and wait for the omelette. Thank you. I had the good fortune to meet Miss Fairlie in the garden. Yes! In the nick of time to save me from bleeding to death. Oh Laura, what have you done now? - Oh, it's nothing. Wait until you hear! Do tell them. Uh, no. Well, he met a mysterious woman on the road last night. She was lost, poor thing, and .. She was dressed all in white. And she looked like me. Didn't you say she looked like me? Hmm. And when she saw a coach approaching, she just vanished into the woods. Like a ghost. A woman in white, mind you. Perhaps Mr Hartright prefers to treat the occurrence as a confidence. The truths is I didn't intend to speak of so strange a thing at all. Until I was forced to give some explanation .. For mistaking Miss Fairlie and the lady in question for one and the same person. They looked so much alike? - I thought so. Now .. I'm not sure. Oh, let the man eat, ladies. I specially recommend the creamed kidney to you, Hartright. You're leaving, Count Fosco? Without even hearing the rest of the story? I'm afraid I must. Your distinguished uncle .. Has asked me to evaluate his renaissance Venetian coinage this morning. Then I must finish a letter to my excellent wife. Do you suppose we can have more of the inexpressible peach cobblers for lunch? I hope so. Ha. Toast? - Yes, thank you. Fairlie! Oh, there you are. Good heavens. My dear Fosco, have you no consideration? What's the matter? She's here. Just as I expected. In Limmeridge? Of course. She has no other contacts in England. Nothing but a childhood memory of this house, Mrs Fairlie and Laura. She actually believes she is Laura some of the time. Oh, dear oh dear. Oh .. Fosco. I really think you've been awful careless about her. I really do. Who saw her? That young drawing-master met her on the road last night. Hartright? What did she tell him? - Nothing important. I don't think I left enough of her own mind to do that. But we must find her at once. Why don't you? Why don't you? Oh dear, whatever shall we do? Will you send for Sir Percival Glyde. Oh I hope not any more complications. Sir Percival will be of no help to us. His solution for everything is violence. He'd have done for the girl, instead of an asylum. But I detest violence. So clumsy. Yes, and noisy. Oh. No violence, please. Police .. bodies .. no. My nerves could never stand it. Ha ha ha .. Oh, but you should never have let her out of your sight, Mr Hartright. Why, you never can tell what might happen. I doubt it's anything to do with it, but there was a little girl here for a time. A strange, unhappy little thing. Somebody's cousin or other that had been living abroad. Laura couldn't have been more than 8 or 9. And long before you came to us, Miss Marian. Are you quite sure you're not making this up? I like that. I remember the child perfectly, I assure you. She was about the age of Laura and as like her as a pair of slippers. Mrs Fairlie dressed them both in Laura's clothes. Wait a minute. I begin to remember. She followed me everywhere, like a shadow. Oh, I think you're dreaming, all of you. But I intend to find out. Fairlie won't tell you anything. Fairlie? There are other ways. Are you coming Mrs Vesey? You seem very much engrossed. Ah! I'm playing detective. These are old letters to my mother from Mrs Fairlie. They were devoted sisters, of course. I hoped there might be some mention of the little girl Mrs Vesey spoke of. Well .. - No, nothing yet. I leave you to the quest. That was very nice. Oh Mr Hartright. Could you look here for a moment? Yes. Excuse me, please. Listen to this. "To my mother from Mrs Fairlie, September 1839." 12 years ago. "Since I last wrote to you." "A small girl has been sent to stay with us for a while by Frederick Fairlie." "My husband's brother." "Whom we so seldom see." "It seems she's the orphan daughter of one of the Fairlie cousinly connections. "Which are too numerous and complex for my simple mind ever to unravel." "At any rate, she's a sweet child about a year older than .." "Our Laura." "And resembles her so strikingly .." "That I have taken a violent fancy to her." "But there's a brooding weight upon this poor little creature's mind." "I'm trying my best to help her." "And you should hear some of the pretty things she says in return. "Yesterday, I gave her some of Laura's little things." "Including a new white-lace dress." "It was touching." "She kissed my hand. She was raised abroad, you know." "And said .." "I will wear white as long as I live." "It will help me to remember you." "Her name is Ann Catherick." "And I will tell you more of her later." So we know her name. There can be little doubt of that. But where's she been all these years. Why is she at Limmeridge? What does she want of us? I don't know. Somehow I find it a little frightening. Could you do me the favour of not mentioning this letter to Count Fosco. Do I see rightly? Or is that a monkey? Alas you see well enough. It's Count Fosco's monkey. He calls it Iago. Ah, here we are! I've brought the family Fosco downstairs to bid you goodnight. They were getting lonely, I fear. I see you've already met Iago, Mr Hartright. This fellow and Miss Halcombe get on famously. Don't you sly devil? I wish you'd tell me how you do it. Get down. Here are my pigeons. Persis and Menisan. Coo-coo my sweets, my pretties. Indeed, they restore my faith in conjugal felicity. It's a perfect match. Most touching. What a picture Miss Fairlie makes in a lovely white dress in the moonlight. Not too far from your strange figure in your story, Mr Hartright. So much so, in fact. That I thought for a moment that I too, might be suffering hallucinations. The lady I spoke of was no hallucination, Count Fosco. Not at all. Up! Come on. Up! Up .. that's right. Now, if you don't mind, I will say goodnight. Ah. Now that the circus is over, I think I also will retire. May I have the letter, please? - Yes, I .. Oh, it's gone. I put it on this table. Count Fosco must have taken it. I may as tell you, Miss Halcombe, I've a strange feeling about this gentleman. His arrival on the heels of that girl's escape. His curiosity about my walk from the village. He leaves us for bed. Only to stalk the terrace for hours in the dark. His shock just now at the sight of Miss Fairlie, all in white like the other. And then .. the letter. What interest has Count Fosco in the woman in white? And why does he not come out with it? - Mr Hartright. Must I remind you that Count Fosco is a guest in this house. I'm sorry. Forgive my want of manners. I'll not mention it again. I really think you're jumping to unnecessary conclusions. Don't you? Count Fosco has added much to our rather humdrum lives these past few years. And he seems to like you very much. As we all do. Good night. What is it? - Oh, it's nothing. How pleasantly the summer lingers. When one has such charming company. Surely, you must miss your dear wife, Count Fosco? Ha .. I do. I do. And the morning time. Don't deceive me. You are concerned. What is it? It's really nothing. This household has become very dear to me. I'm still in no position to speak of such matters. Oh, but I insist. Don't you think then, since you force me to say so .. That a lovely girl like Laura must make a very strong appeal to a young man. A very human young man in this case, I might add. After all, I plead his cause my dear. All of us men are but ships in the storm when our feelings are stirred. As even I can testify. I don't know what else might be expected. When two such young people are so closely and intimately thrown together. All nature conspiring against the most resolute of principles. I've heard enough! Indeed, far too much. How little you consider Laura's awareness of her position. To say nothing of her sense of honour. And how unjust you are. Both Laura and I have come to regard Walter Hartright as a friend. A very dear friend. One moment. There's the glass. See them together with your own eyes. Very well. If it will end this insinuation. You may have to adjust it a little. You've spoiled it! - It was already spoiled. Yesterday I thought I saw some gaiety and dash and character in your drawing. Today, you're merely another young girl who wants to make pretty pictures. You're just wasting my time. You don't try! Oh I do try! I try my best but I .. Oh Miss Fairlie, forgive me. I only thought perhaps I could help you. Laura .. look at me please. I didn't mean to hurt you. You know I wouldn't .. Darling. Darling. I thought I could keep all of this from you, Laura, but .. Don't say it Walter. You .. you mustn't. Sir Percival. What a surprise. We weren't expecting you back for another month. Put it down to the impatience of a prospective bridegroom, my friend. Rome and Paris have lost their charm. And .. Laura? Patience man, she blooms. Positively blooms in anticipation of your happiness. What is the meaning of this? I warned you not to come here now. I had to. My circumstances are desperate. This marriage must be pushed through at once. It will ruin everything. The Catherick girl is still at large. Laura's enamoured of her drawing teacher. I was speaking of you with Fairlie only the other day. He was hoping you might find a certain D?rer to complete his collection. I have it. And in exchange I shall exact the price of his hospitality for a few days. An easy price to pay, Sir Percival, for as long as you wish. Glyde Hall may not even be ready for its new Mistress .. If they don't get on with the alterations. Oh. You and Laura have settled on a date then? She didn't tell me. Only my fond hope, that's all. The sooner, the happier. Of course, of course. The happier for everyone I should think. Here you are Percival. She runs to meet you in as pretty a confusion as you could wish for. Sir Percival. Laura, dear. I hope you will forgive my unannounced arrival. I had the chance to come and the sweet thought of you was no longer resistible. You're always welcome here. Mr Hartright. I took this chance to find you alone, Walter. Did you? Do you know that's the first time you've ever called me by my Christian name? It was not an accident. We are true friends, aren't we? Marian, if you knew what it means to me just now to have you say that. No man could have a finer friend, or need one more, believe me. I'm so glad. Walter .. I saw what happened in the meadow. Count Fosco and I were amusing ourselves with the telescope. He knows, too? He didn't even need the glass. He .. Knows people better than I do. - And trusts them less .. Perhaps. But the fault is not yours Walter, nor hers. It's mine. My uncle being what he is, it's my responsibility here. I should have known what would happen. I should have known, not you. But I was too happy. I thought I could hide my feelings. And Laura? I don't know. - It's better that you don't. This is hard to say but listen, Walter, and let's get it over with at once. You must leave Limmeridge House immediately. Before more harm is done. Because Laura is engaged to be married. Engaged? She's promised to Sir Percival Glyde of Glyde Hall. It happened more than two years ago, with Fairlie's permission. With his enthusiasm and urging I should say. But also, by Laura's own choice. It seemed a brilliant match. They met in London during the season and .. Percival quite swept her off her feet. An engagement of this kind .. When Percival has shown nothing but patience and understanding is .. As binding upon Laura as a marriage. You realize that, don't you? But how can it be binding? Unless she loves him? For people of honour, it is. Make no mistake, you'll see now that he's here. Here? Now? Yes, we were all surprised. He'll be here for some days. You're right. I couldn't stand to see them together. I must leave at once. I'll make your excuses to Fairlie, Walter. Ann. - Oh! Don't be frightened. You must remember me? On the road that night? I showed you the way. Don't you remember? Ah. You were kind to me. I'll never go back there again. Never, never! I'd rather die. You don't think I should be in an asylum, do you? Tell me .. where have you been all this time? Oh .. First I go one place. And then another. I am very clever. Do you know how I escaped from the asylum? I changed the keys. They never thought of that. Then, when the man came to lock us in at night I .. You'll never tell them, will you. They'll never find me. I have my own money. Almost sixty pounds. But .. what do you want? What is it that you're seeking here, Ann? Why, I want to see Laura. Don't you know? I must .. I must! I must warn her. She'll know it's true. She'll believe me. She's our mother you know. In the game I mean. Actually, Laura's the beautiful one. You do look very much like Laura. Yes. Well. Of course I do. What is it you want to tell Laura? Tell me Ann, I'll believe you. Only her. She'll know. But I'm afraid. That's why they put me there. Because I'll tell, I'll tell. Then he comes to the asylum and tells you and tells you, it isn't true. Who? Count Fosco? He tells you it's all a dream. But it isn't. It's true. It's true. - Ann. Look at me. Do you know Laura's about to be married? To Sir Percival Glyde. Oh, but she mustn't. She mustn't. I'll tell her. She'll believe me. Will you go with me into the house and tell her now? Ann, if you come with me, I'll bring you face-to-face with Laura. Oh I'm afraid, afraid .. afraid. This is your chance, Ann. I will protect you. You won't let them? You're not afraid of them? - No. It's for Laura's sake. Will you come? I .. I don't know why I trust you. Except that I must trust someone. Let me tell you sir, exactly what it is I know. Then I'll go with you. It seems apparent you're under a strain of some kind. Is the matter something we can talk about? It would not be easy, Percival. The less so because of your patience with me and all your thoughtfulness. May they not argue then for my willingness to understand you now? Very well. I've learned it's better to face things and you're entitled to my honesty. I hope I've earned that privilege. It's much deeper than you think. This change you see in me. It is so serious, in fact, as to justify you in breaking off our engagement. Oh. Oh, you'd not be freeing me to marry another man, if that's what you think. No word has passed then, between you and this .. "Other man"? No. There's little likelihood we shall ever meet again. But surely I've said more than enough haven't I to .. My dear .. No, you couldn't. You couldn't ask it of me. I draw upon my years and my experience .. Not to permit you to exaggerate passing attachment. Or am I heartless enough .. To resign a girl who has honoured me with her confidence and trust? No, no. How can you without my love? It is to be my one purpose to recapture. Well, I've said all I can. Shall we go inside now? Mister Hartright has called and demands to see you. Demands, does he? Where is he Jepson? I've shown him into the library, Miss Marian. Very well, I'll see him there. This is most important, Marian. - I'm sure it is Walter. Or you wouldn't be here, under the circumstances. I've met Ann Catherick again. Ann? - I talked to her. And her accusations against Count Fosco and Sir Percival Glyde are such .. Wait a moment, Walter. I don't know why you have this prejudice against Count Fosco. And now, Sir Percival, whom you don't even know. It would be more courageous to say what you have to say of them .. To their faces, and certainly more courteous. Courteous? I think you carry courtesy too far with such people. I think she's in actual danger. Some hold they have over Fairlie has brought this about. As for my courage, I shall be more than happy to present these charges .. In which I firmly believe, to the gentlemen in person. Jepson. Will you ask Count Fosco, Sir Percival and Miss Laura to come in here please. Walter, please understand. When you left here this afternoon, cleanly, decisively, like a man. You took with you not only Laura's love but also my .. Own deepest respect. My admiration. Mr Hartright has something to say to you gentlemen. And I thought it right Laura that he say it before you. I prefer to spare her any unpleasantness, of course. I shall remain where I am. Very well, ma'am. You. Say what you have to and be done with it. By all means. A feverish imagination like yours Hartright. Ought not to be restrained. What is it this time, ladies in the dark? Or leprechauns hiding in a tree? My information as you've surmised, came from that young woman, Ann Catherick. Oh, dear me. I was hoping for something new. This girl accuses you, Sir Percival .. Of forcing Frederick Fairlie's consent to you marrying Laura for her fortune. Scarcely flattering to the young lady. And you Count Fosco, as originator of the conspiracy. Me? I can understand how an ill-tempered brute like you .. May frighten a girl into marriage, Percival. But surely, not I. I couldn't be dangerous. I am too fat. This is infamous. And you call yourself a gentleman? - I couldn't! In any sense you would understand. Ann Catherick charges you also with putting her in a private asylum. Because you're afraid of her. Of what she can tell Laura Fairlie. Some years ago when I was in Italy .. Your uncle Frederick wrote asking me to look up this Catherick girl. Who I believe is some relative. I found her in such pitiable mental condition that I .. Brought her back to England and placed her in proper care. Count Fosco's knowledge and influence with the asylum where we placed her .. Was of great help. You need only ask Fairlie himself about this. Unfortunately, something over two months ago, the poor creature escaped. She needs help and care. I tried my best to find her. If Hartright had the luck to stumble upon her. He would have done better to return her to her benefactors. Rather to listen to her hallucinations and persecutions. Which belong to her malady. Why is it Count Fosco you didn't you give us this simple explanation .. When I met her on the road the night of my arrival? Why? Need you ask, why? A delicate family matter. You may not be aware of it, but it is scarcely the part of a gentleman .. To go blabbing such confidences to the first stranger he meets. I reported it to Fairlie at once. Do you have anything more than the girl's wild talk to go on, Walter? I believe her. So would you if you heard her. I brought her to the very door of this house to charge you to your faces. But unfortunately .. Yes, unfortunately. A magician like you ought to be able to do a few passes in the air and "presto". There she stands .. the woman in white! Marian, surely, you believe me? That asylum you speak of is not a bad place for highly developed imaginations. You might try it some time. Impulsive young man, isn't he. You're new here. What became of Wilfred? I don't know, ma'am. I only came in August. Oh. It's so wonderful to be back. It never changes. I wouldn't know ma'am. I've only been here a few weeks. Where's Jepson? Jepson vacated the place with the others Miss Halcombe about three months ago. My name is Bernard. Oh, but he's been here always. I don't understand. And this is Todd, Miss Halcombe. Our housekeeper. May I show you to your new room, madam. You must be tired. - My new room? The entire south suite has been prepared for Sir Percival and Lady Glyde. Oh yes, have they arrived? Not yet madam. They're not expected until tomorrow. Count and Countess Fosco have the north guest chambers, and .. Countess Fosco? Really? Oh yes, madam. They've been with us for some time. Your room is the third floor front. Oh but that's Mrs Vesey's room. She's always had it. We thought you knew, Miss Halcombe. Mrs Vesey moved to London, let me see, it must have been two months ago. Please inform Mr Fairlie that I have arrived and wish to see him at once. But ma'am, Mr Fairlie particularly asked to welcome you tomorrow. With Sir Percival and Lady Glyde. - Indeed? His acute nervous suffering, it seems .. Does not permit him the pleasure of two welcomes. Don't do anything more. For heaven's sake, don't shake the room! Please, if you must move, move quietly. Forgive me, dearest Marian. You have such beautiful control. How I envy you your robust nervous system. May we please be alone, sir? - Alone? Is anybody else here? - Your man. Oh you mean Louis? Oh you dear, blessed, provoking Marian. Whatever can you mean by calling Louis a "man"? My dear, he's a portfolio stand. Why object to the presence of a portfolio stand? I do object sir, if I may. Leave us alone, you nodding mandolin. Sir, for what possible reason have you sent away all the servants? Oh, don't bully me. Please don't bully me. Really, I am not strong enough. Do as you wish good Marian, as you always have done, only don't bully me. What was it? Oh yes, the servants. Worthless my dear, from top to bottom. It's been like a new place since we got rid of the entire pack of lazy beggars. Oh, how we were put upon all those weary years. It was Percival's suggestion, my dear. Fosco, I am sure, will tell you all about it. And all with dear Laura's approval. And that I cannot believe. Don't contradict me! You know, my wretched constitution won't stand the strain of anger. How I should love the luxury of flying into a fine rage! Rage .. Oh, there it is. So, if there's nothing else, for you dear girl. So nice of you to come. I have no intention of leaving, sir .. Until I have some sensible explanation of these matters. Send me away as is your privilege or treat me friendly. I cannot live in peace in this black morass of mystery .. Which seems to be rising about us. Perhaps, after all, Mr Hartright was not too far .. - Stop! Don't mention that man's name in this room. Deserter .. Ah! How cruel of him, to let that poor girl escape him. She's no doubt dead in some ravine by this time. I have more faith in Walter Hartright than in some others. Really? You couldn't possibly mean me? Fosco? Percival? How ungrateful you are to us all, Marian. It was Percival's first insistence, knowing your devotion to Laura .. That you stay here with them and go to Glyde Hall with them when it is ready. That was kind of him. Perhaps I misjudged him. I hope so. Have you heard from Laura? She wrote to me from Paris and Vienna. About their travels and nothing else. They were the letters of a stranger. Mister Fairlie. - Exquisite. Exquisite. Percival. - Hmm? May I have one of those .. cigarettes? Of course, my dear. Don't be so shocked darling. Any number of ladies in Paris are taking it up. Aren't they Percival? Oh yes, yes. They've acquired our male bad habits along with our privileges. Isn't that so, grandfather? Please .. take it Percival. You must give me another lesson. Here you are grandfather, never too old to learn. Sorry, my dear fellow. You'll forgive an old friend a few drops of wine, won't you? Thank you. I promise it won't happen again. Will it? See, you mustn't corrupt Iago. We Foscos are a conservative, old-fashioned family. Aren't we, my beloved wife? Come .. you may tell us what you think. I think as you think, Alessandro. Very wise of you too. You couldn't do better. Could she? In my opinion. If I've your permission to give it Count Fosco, everyone must think for himself. I began to do so when I arrived back here .. Yesterday afternoon. Will you let me to show them the little present I've selected for you my dear? I take it out of our strongbox occasionally. Just to let my beloved look at it. Oh .. diamonds and emeralds. A pretty penny that cost. It's very beautiful. Exquisite. Oh why don't you put it on Countess Fosco? I am sure it's becoming. Oh, it's not quite hers yet. We are waiting for that supreme moment .. When her forcefulness completely overwhelms me. Aren't we, my dear? Why, what's the matter? You must be tired. But I'm feeling much better, Alessandro. I'm not tired at all. It's a Spartan streak in you English women. How I admire it. Quite unnecessary this evening. I .. I hope you will all forgive me. Goodnight. "Thinking does no good. I've thought enough." "And every instant I become more frightened." "One thing." "Laura is lost to us." "For ever." Marian. Marian, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. I didn't mean to hurt you. But I had to pretend in front of them. But I'm just the same. I haven't changed. Oh Laura, of course you haven't. I should have known. They couldn't really change you. Marian, I've been so miserable since I've been away. Percival thinks only of money. He'll do anything for it. Did you know about the marriage settlement? - No. It provides the entire Fairlie fortune goes to Percival in event of my death. I wish I would die sometimes. Have you heard anything from Walter? No, I haven't. I discovered he left England almost at once for Italy. Italy? Later, several sketches by him appeared in The Tatler. Street scenes in Rome. And then, a painting. A very remarkable portrait was hung in the Royal Academy. I read a description of it and went to see it when I was in London. A portrait? Of me? No. Of you dear? Oh, of course not. Didn't you know what he thought of you? I did. I never knew which of us he was falling in love with. The portrait was very like you. But with great shadows around the eyes and a haunting look of fear. It was called "The Woman In White". Well, we didn't believe him. If we'd only believed him. I had no right to sign that settlement. It's not my fortune. It belongs to the family. Mr Gilmore begged me not to. He gave up handling our affairs over it after thirty years. They made me sign it, Marian. Why didn't you do something? I ..? But I wrote you, and wrote you. You never got them? You never got the letters that really mattered? He stopped them. I didn't receive any letters from you after you arrived in Rome. I'm afraid of him, darling. So terribly. What is it Laura? I'm just not feeling very well. I think perhaps I'd better go to my room. I'll go with you. - Oh no. Percival has gone with Fosco to talk business with Fairlie. He may be back at any moment. I'll be alright. Goodnight dear. - Goodnight. "We know your schemes." "I've had enough of them." "Do you even care how I suffer?" "Not particularly." "This fine cruelty, such torture. Such infinite pain." "Buck up!" "It's nothing to the pain you'll have if the whole county knows what we know." "Please .. poor Ann." Why don't you find her? - Ask Fosco. He's the great genius. Who never makes a slip. It's not right, it's not kind to let the poor thing roam at large like this. Oh, it's shameful. She might talk. She will say whatever I want her to say, like anyone who's been in my charge. I'd like to be sure of that. This miniature is exquisite. Did you notice the delicate shading here? Look at the flow of that shoulder into the arm, one can almost feel .. Oh how can you! How can you? Will you two stop this play-acting and get down to business. What about that money? And I don't mean driblets, I mean twenty thousand pounds! So, we are back to it again. [ Thunderclap ] Quite a storm coming up. Twenty thousand pounds now! I've got to have it, do you hear. But I haven't it. I told you I never had anything but the income. No .. Laura has it. You've got your settlement. You get everything if she dies. Isn't that enough? - No. I need the money now. A name on a piece of paper is all I need. Of course, I'd rather get it that way. Be quiet, Percival. If you can't make her sign it, I will. Ruined and disgraced, on the whim of a stubborn girl. By heaven I'll .. Be quiet! You fool. Yes, you .. shrink from that little idea don't you. That would solve everything. A fool and a coward. We are a great pair, Fosco. I shrink from nothing .. but stupidity. Murder is the resort of imbeciles. Murder? Oh, you couldn't. The whole house would be full of Police and things. Something's got to happen. I've already attended to that. She'll sign. Really? When? Tomorrow perhaps .. or the next day. Good night gentlemen. Pleasant dreams. Will you please close that window. A filthy night .. in a filthy world. I know one tries not to live in it but .. They make you. Oh! Don't be frightened. What do you want? Since you take such fantastic risks to find out about us. I thought it would be safer. If I came and told you. How did you get in here? The door was locked. A locked door to me is no more than a ribbon. Wrapping up a lovely gift. But if you believe my considerable bulk could become a wraith. I seeped in through the keyhole. Was it necessary to hide there and shame me as well? I was only too happy to discover something at last. As flawless in form. As it is in spirit. Marian, come here. I want to talk to you. What a combination. What an existence. Your courage, your indomitable character and loveliness. And the fabulous gifts of my mind .. Wait .. think about it. There's no hurry. You have a wife, Count Fosco. Yes, a devoted creature but a cypher. I met a lady in a charming village in Sorrento. She had a modest fortune. And enjoyed a regular remittance from England. I was out of funds, as usual. Absurd that my achievements should be hampered by a stupid accident of money. Now we shall have the Fairlie fortune to command. Laura's fortune. Oh no. Never. She .. she knows you as well as I do. She'll sign over to us as much as we want. Tomorrow. What do you mean? You've done something to her? You. You incredible fiend. You murderer! No. I've never found that quite necessary. I should hate it. Any sort of uh .. physical violence. We shall talk again. You will come to me of your own accord. [ Door knocks ] What is it? Sir Percival sent me, sir. I've searched the house for you. Her Ladyship is suddenly ill. He asks you to come. - Let me go. I'll come at once. In the meantime, I want you to remain outside this door. In deference to your charming adventurousness. He'll watch the outside as well. Miss Halcombe does not wish to leave her room. Or send any messages. Even as an antagonist, I admire you my dear. Such dash .. such resolution. Such delightful folly. I've been looking for you. Laura's ill with a fever and babbling a lot of nonsense. I think you'd better have a look at her. That won't be necessary. Oh, I'm sure it doesn't matter to me one way of the other. Quite as I expected. The initial reaction is always rather violent. What do you mean? You're anxious for her to sign that paper, aren't you? I think that tomorrow you'll find her more amenable. Oh .. don't! Don't be frightened of me. I only want to help you. No .. No .. Where's Marian? I want Marian. Please understand me. Please .. I must warn you. I must! Why doesn't Marian come? It's the money. It's the money they want. Oh but they'll kill you. They will, they will! I saw a good deal of typhus when I was a student at Galicia. I thought I recognized it when I first saw her. The symptoms are similar. But I can check this malady as easily as induce it. Whenever I wish. Check it then. Or go through with it. It's no good to us this way. A little too soon to decide that. Well .. I've been trying to make her sign the cursed thing for two days now. It's hopeless. A more violent reaction than I wanted. But .. wait. Is that you Marian? No. Please take her away. She frightens me! Who? Who frightens you? Countess Fosco? Marian? Where is Marian? Who frightened you? Who? That girl. What girl? She's .. She's all in white. She's .. oh .. Have you left her alone at any time? Oh no, sir. I mean, only like now, to get the linens. Countess Fosco and I have been here every minute. What does it mean? - I don't know. I don't think you'd better leave the house this evening, Percival. She hasn't eaten a thing for two days my lady. She'll need some strength. You may go to bed now, Todd. You must be tired. - Yes, my lady. Thank you, my lady. Goodnight, my lady. Why haven't you come? I couldn't. I couldn't get away. Why? He watches me all the time. He suspects. You must go away, Ann. You promised to go once you'd seen Laura. She was ill. She didn't understand. You can't do anything against him. Haven't you learned that? What's the use of it? What did you want to tell her? You know. Oh. Eat your supper, Ann. You always did like the second day beef. Did I? - Yes. I don't remember. - You liked it with the brown sauce. I'm not hungry. - But you must be. Have you been having your pain again? I had it. I can't remember when. What time is it now? - It's late. They're all asleep. You mustn't go there again, Ann. Oh I .. I was mad .. mad to let you come here. They might not want to put you back there again. They might .. They might not .. Want to put you back there. You're better. Now you will understand. At last I can tell you. Oh, please don't be afraid of me. We should never be afraid of each other, should we? How could we? It would be like .. Like being afraid of yourself. Oh .. where shall I begin? Sometimes, I .. I can't quite remember. [ Fosco: ] "Oh yes you can. Tell her." "You were quite a young lady then, weren't you.." "You overheard us." Yes. Yes, Sir Percival was there too. [ Percival: ] "That's right. It was in Rome." "Remember?" No! Don't stand there. Get some water! The girl is dead. Quite. There will be an investigation. What do we do now? We think .. Or at least I do .. Oh! God bless. Amen. Where is Count Fosco? Fosco is not the family, after all. You know well he received a telegram .. And left for London on urgent business the night poor Laura died. If we'd only listened to you, Walter. If you'd only come sooner. I had just returned to England when I saw the notice in The Times. I came at once. Now she's gone. They killed her! I know they did. What are you thinking, Walter? What is it? Nothing. Nothing! I've told you all I know about things. What you're not telling me speaks louder than your words. Tell me, Walter. But how can I tell you? How can I raise your hopes on such a mere suspicion? Please! It is not a suspicion, I am certain of it. This Fosco is no crude murderer. He's worse. Far worse. As perfect as his scheme was .. He didn't expect that face to be looked at with eyes that had searched Laura's. Or to those of a portrait painter to whom every .. Plane and facet and feature has a special meaning. No, Walter. The white-shrouded girl in that coffin was Ann Catherick. More than likely, Laura is still alive. Alive? I think, if their evil circle is complete. We will find her in that same, private asylum from which Ann escaped. About a dozen miles from here, over Newbury way. Yes, yes, that's it, of course it is. Come. We must get the Police. - Now wait a minute, Marian. Have you thought as I have, what will happen to Laura if we get the Police? If we frighten them in any way? We must go to Newbury by ourselves. We must speak of this to no one. Whatever we can do. We must do it alone. Come back in half an hour. - Yes, sir. You gentlemen will prefer to be alone with Miss Catherick, no doubt. No doubt. But if there is anything further you wish done, Count Fosco .. Just anything at all .. Did he mean that? Anything? Have you ever stopped talking like a common footpad? Will you ever get over this idea of killing her? Seriously, Percival .. I advise you never to get mixed up in this sort of thing again. If I do, it will be on my own. I like things over and done with. - Over and done with? How often is murder over and done with? What, on the other hand is so complete .. So exquisitely final .. As a well-arranged natural death? You had the good judgement to leave this matter to me for 3 invaluable months. Don't interfere. Thanks. Come in. Draw the curtains. Hello Ann .. how are you today? My name is Ann Catherick. I was born in Sorrento. My mother is now the Countess Fosco. Count Fosco is .. Yes, yes. That's fine. Sir Percival and I have come here to make sure you are comfortable. You have everything you want here? You remember Sir Percival, don't you? I .. I answer to a false name. If I don't .. I'm beaten, and starved. Do you want your child to be born in a place like this? My child? Ann. Come here. I'm really impatient with you, Ann. For weeks, months now, I've explained to you that Laura Fairlie is dead. Buried in Limmeridge, before the whole county. I've showed the newspapers, the records. The doctor's report. I do my best for you, but we can never take you home .. If you persist in this silly delusion. You are Ann Catherick. You are Ann Catherick. Hear only my voice, Ann. I give you my thoughts, Ann's thoughts. Think through my mind .. to Ann's mind. To know what I know .. what Ann knows. Only what Ann knows. I see you as just a little girl, digging in the sands of Amalfi. I went to the English school at Firenze. When I was eleven. My mother is now the Countess Fosco and .. There, there. Never mind Anina. You may run along now. You! Come here a moment. Wait there! [ Fosco: ] "Think through my mind to Ann's mind." "Think through my mind to Ann's mind." "You know what I know, and what Ann knows." "Only what Ann knows." "I know what I know .. what Ann knows." "Only what Ann knows." "Ann's thoughts." If it pleases you, dear Miss Catherick, may we go back to your room now? Good day, gentlemen. My dear Percival, any further questions? My services are expensive. I want you to feel you've had your money's worth. One thing then, Fosco. If I give you the money now, how long must I put up with this uncertainty? I mean, how long would she last? Must you put it so bluntly? However, let me see. She'll resist the idea occasionally for another month. Any longer, with more physical damage, of course. Then she will give in, and accept her new identity as a fact. Oh come on. How long? Two months mental collapse. Physical destruction. The human organism cannot tolerate such psychological poison. Most unfortunate. Are you going to Limmeridge? Yes, for the last weekend. Charming place. I shall hate to leave it. Sir Percival, we arrive at our final transaction. You led me to believe the "enterprise" was more definitely concluded. However .. there it is. Gold notes. A deposit record of the balance of your credit in the bank in Paris. I needn't count it. You haven't the imagination to cheat me, have you. You'd only brood on how much less expensive it might have been .. To put a knife in my back. Yes .. I did think of it. Then you reflected, didn't you? What a jolly old fellow Fosco was! After all, you just couldn't do without me. Considering that the "enterprise" was not, as you so accurately put it .. More definitely concluded. Arrivederci. Sir Percival. - What is it? Miss Halcombe and Mr Hartright are in Newbury, sir. They arrived this morning. You sure? - Quite sure, sir. They're staying in a house at the top of the village. Do you think they will try something? - I don't know, sir. Come. Show me the place. - This way, Sir Percival. Walter, don't you think we ought to go to the Police? No, our first move will mean their last. We'll think of something. But it's just the Percival is here and they may be taking her away. I'm going to watch outside The Cedars tonight. If they try to take her away, I'll follow them. Oh, if we could only think of .. Ahh! Sir Percival. Walter. Be careful. I've loved you ever since that night I left Limmeridge, Marian. If you had only known how difficult it was for me to send you away. Walter. Be careful. One .. two .. buckle .. my .. shoe. Three .. four .. lock .. the .. door. Five .. six .. pick .. up .. sticks. I'm going to lock them in now, Kate. You can go home. Goodnight. You ought to go to sleep, young lady. One .. two .. buckle .. my .. shoe. Five .. six. Thirty-six? Six .. ? Strange. Sir? Could you help me, sir? I want to .. Ahh! Oh no you don't, Hartright. Sir Percival! Laura! Marian. That's funny. I .. "Dearest Walter, I know now what it is I must do." "As long as Laura is under the influence of Fosco, we are powerless to help her." "I am going to Limmeridge House, to make one last appeal to him." "If that fails, I .." Fosco. Come. We've no time to lose. We must get the Police. Your proposal doesn't surprise me. Like a good General, you admit defeat when it's a fact. You're bold, you're logical. My dear .. you're immensely tempting. Please Count Fosco, can you not say "yes" or "no"? Let me see, then. You suggest I take my ill-gotten gains, flee England, abandon my precious wife. Precious? The day you do so, will be the day of her deliverance. Well, convenient then. In either case, utterly unimportant. And that I leave a written testament. I dislike the word "confession". Which will free Laura Fairlie from what you call her torment. And restore her to her proper identity and position. And one more thing. - Ah yes. One more thing. I must leave at once, within the hour. Have I stated it correctly? Yes. - Good. And if I do all this, you will go with me? You rang for me, sir? Yes. Please see to it that my bags are packed for travelling immediately. You may order the coach at once. - Very good, sir. This means that you accept? With you, and wealth and the rest of the bright world. One can well afford to give up England. Beastly climate. Now my dear, you may remove that uncomfortable .. And scarcely flattering pistol from your dress. Would you have actually shot me with it? Yes, if you had refused. I couldn't stand Laura suffering any longer. How magnificent. How forthright. You never let me down, dear Marian. Now to work. It will be a mere r?sum? of course. Later, I'll write a treatise on the crime. Let me see. I'll begin at the Palazzo of the Mecasa de Berochi in Rome. A haunt for high-stakes play at the tables. I was .. gambling a little. Or they thought I was gambling. Silly of them. I never gamble, do I? I met Sir Percival Glyde there. He told me an interesting story about a beautiful young English girl he'd known. A member of one of the oldest and wealthiest county families. What a scandal when they discovered this charming young woman was .. Going to have a baby. "Out of wedlock" as they say in this lugubrious country. Her younger brother Frederick, a playmate from childhood. Stood by her in an ineffectual way. Yes, Frederick Fairlie. So useful to me. But her father and her elder brother, Richard .. Both arrogant, admirable gentlemen. Packed her off to Italy, and calmly announced she'd died there. You're lying .. that's not true. Oh no. I never lie. Unless there's some point to it. May I resume? The young lady however, preferred not to die. Quite the contrary. She had her baby, a little girl called Ann .. Ann Catherick. Since that was the name the mother found convenient. By whatever name .. This Ann was the blood first cousin of Richard Fairlie's daughter, Laura .. Born the next year. And as the family's strain was strong .. Was enough like her to be a twin. You follow me, I see. What would Frederick Fairlie not pay to keep this scandal buried? You realize the splendid possibilities? So did I. Especially since I had a personal interest in the matter. A family interest you might say. You? Yes, it was Percival who first told me that Ann Catherick's mother .. And Frederick Fairlie's beloved sister was none other than my adored wife. She was beautiful. Very beautiful. Yes, my dear Louis, she was very beautiful. Unfortunately, the young men of the county discovered her loveliness. And also, that she had less resistance than beauty. Very awkward of course. Personally, I'm disposed to regard such accidents as no great importance, but .. You can imagine what happened. What a to-do in the family. I think it was about that time I decided .. People were not worth bothering with, Louis. Ouch! Oh you wicked, wicked Louis! Isn't enough that you neglect me from morning until night, without burning me. Go and cover the portrait. You don't deserve to look at her any longer. Satisfactory? Not to mention what it will do to Percival. Alessandro Fosco. What do you intend to do with this document? If I were you I would post it direct to the Police before we leave the country. I don't wish to be tempted. Thank you. I shall do that. Now begins the most exciting chapter in your life dear Marian. And in mine. This little bauble is a token .. Of the loveliness. Of which I shall clothe you. No, I don't want it. It belongs to .. Do you really think I would have chosen emeralds for you? I bought the necklace for a fraction of its worth from an old friend in London. A Czech from Prague. It was just after my first visit to Limmeridge. When I met you. So you see my dear, even that .. A trifle like a jewel, was planned. Planned leaving no room for accident. Only for the unfolding of a beautiful inevitability. This and much more will I teach you, exquisite Marian. You will learn there is no human gift of weakness, of foible. So inconsequential that it cannot be turned to good use. Like the tiniest sprocket in a rare Geneva chronometer. Like the most minute device in the intricate design .. Of a fabulous Persian rug. Laura! Can be .. fitted. Fitted .. into the faultless .. pattern. Of the master plan. Marian. Walter. [ Walter Hartright: ] "All things pass." "And for seven years now this monstrous villainy has lain buried in the earth." "Countess Fosco, poor soul, still plays with her lovely toy." "She's quite happy and harmless in that same sanatorium." "Which Laura's generosity and abundant wealth .." "Has, long since, transformed into a pleasant home." "And each afternoon of the odd day." "She's taken across the street for a visit with her dear brother, Frederick." "Here at last, Fairlie is no longer bothered by .. people." "Louis will be fanning him obediently." "While one can almost hear his master complaining .." "What a dreadful ordeal the gentle heat of summer can be." "To a man .. in his condition." "Best of all is the happiness at Limmeridge House." "And the joy with which I return to it from any small journey." "It has long been our home now." "The small girl there is Marian's and mine." "0ur daughter, Ann." "The boy is Laura's." "His name is Walter. Sir Walter Glyde no less." "They want my criticism of their drawings." "And I make a suggestion or two." "There is not much time." "For I hear Laura's happy laughter .." "And the music of my Marian's voice inside the house." "And I know they'll be coming out to greet me." -(r0-s)-
