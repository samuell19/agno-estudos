(rock guitar) - If there was any one person that was responsible for Southern Rock music it was Duane Allman. - [Voiceover] In the mid 1970s a handful of bands from the deep south reinvigorated American Popular music. Yet, the man that set the template for these acts, and who had struggled to gain acceptance in an industry firmly established in the North, was by then just a memory. Duane Allman, the lead guitarist, and driving force behind Southern Rock figureheads The Allman Brothers Band lived a tragically short life, but during his brief career changed music forever. - He was the South in his playing. I think the dedication and all the years with that guitar in his hands all the time, you know, he became great. I felt like the world was his to conquer, you know? I really did. - Duane was, and continues to be, in my opinion, the ultimate... there is no better. The fluidiness, the actual melodic structure, the tonality, everything about him was just that much better than anyone else. - [Voiceover] This film looks at Allman's musical output from his early days in Florida, to his influencial session work in Muscle Shoals, his monumental collaboration with Eric Clapton, and the inimitable virtuosity with which he set The Allman Brothers Band alight. - He was just incredible, the emotion, the feeling of the music and you can see it. - There was this look of ecstacy on his face when he was really into it. And, no amound of showmanship can really compare to witnessing this illumination of an artist in the process of making art. (rock music) ("That's All Right, Mama" by Elvis Presley) ♪Well, that's all right, mama ♪That's all right with you ♪That's all right, mama - [Voiceover] As Elvis Presley arrived on the scene in 1954, his first regional hit, That's All Right, Mama, signaled a revolution in American music. The premium act to emerge from Sam Phillips' framed Sun Studios, Elvis and his label mates Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis spearheaded the new movement of white Rock and Roll born out of the musical melting pot of the South. - White Rock and Roll, it comes out of Memphis Rockabilly, Sun Studios, all of that is true. It was hardly as impossible to imitate as people say it was, even Ricky Nelson did a pretty good job of imitating it, but where it starts is there. It starts with white singers with a feeling for black music that is, to a certain extent, a function of the different ways racial relations worked in the South and the North. In the North, there was more tolerance, and a certain amount of cultural and economic integration. But, day to day intereaction? Day to day interaction happened much more in the South. And so, it's not at all surprising that a certain number of young white kids, and this goes back before Rock and Roll. This is the story of the country singer Jimmie Rogers and Hank Williams, too. Learned both musical orientations having to do mostly with rhythm and vocal intonation, and also cultural attitudes. - [Voiceover] As America entered the 1960s however things had changed. The first wave of Rock and Roll had died off and cultured notherners were being drawn to a revitalized Folk movement that openly attacked the white South. The harmony or racial interaction that had produced artists like Elvis was now overshadowed by the shocking injustices of an inexcusable culture. - In the early sixties when the Folk boom hit and the, you know, opposition to the Viet Nam War, and the Civil Rights Movement, all this stuff was happening. And, you had Bob Dylan doing Oxford Town, you had Phil Ochs singing Here's to the State of Mississippi, and you had, you know, Pete Seger, and Joan Baez all talking about this terrible place down there called the South. Much of the problem that southern musicians faced in the early sixties was the bad PR we were getting as a culture. - [Voiceover] By the time of the great resurgence of white Rock and Roll in the sixties spearheaded by the Beatles and the British Invasion, the South had been left behind. Although it's sound was the inspiration behind nearly every new band emerging on the scene, and acts like The Rolling Stones were championing Blues artists previously unrecognized in their own country, young, white southern musicians were unable to respond. - There was no music coming out of the South. There was Motown in Detroit. There was Chess Records in Chicago. You know, there was the Brill building in New York, there was L.A. and those were really the hubs, except for Stax Records in Memphis. And, there were no clubs to play in the South, there were no talent scouts, there were no record labels. There were really no opportunities for white southern bands to do anything, or go anywhere. - [Voiceover] Yet, with the release of The Allman Brothers Band's debut album in 1969 all that changed. ("Don't Keep Me Wonderin'" by Allman Brothers Band) ♪Oh, tell me 'bout the car I saw ♪Parked outside your door ♪Tell me what you left me wait--♪ - Now, there was a band from the South. Before that, it was WIlson Pickett, and Percy Sledge, and Otis Redding, and Sam and Dave, and that was all great, but there weren't any Rock bands that had come from the South in ages. ("Don't Keep Me Wonderin'" by The Allman Brother Band) - There was a southern pride element that certainly helped as well. The Allman Brothers, that was my band, because they were from the same place I was. And, that was the band of a lot of other people who were from Alabama, and Tennesse, and Georgia, and Florida because we didn't have any before then, and suddenly we did. - [Voiceover] And, the driving force behind the band was Duane Allman, a virtuoso guitarist whose determination to break into the rock world almost single-handedly reinvigorated the southern music scene. Daytona Beach, Florida it was here in the early sixties that Duane Allman's musical journey began. Born in 1946 in Nashville, his brother Gregg born the following year. Duane was only three years old when his father Willis was murdered in a robbery. In 1957, the family relocated to this sleepy tourist town on the east coast of Florida. Very quickly the Allman's house on Van Avenue became a popular hangout for the brother's circle of friends. - I had my first cigarette there, I had my first beer there, I read my first playboy there. There were people, guys our age, coming and going all the time. If you were there friend, their house was your house. You were part of the family. And, mama was particular about the ones that she would let come in and out of the house, but she was working to support the boys and herself so she wasn't there all the time. So, we had the opportunity to do a lot of things we wouldn't have been able to do in our own homes, or maybe going to anyone elses house. - [Voiceover] As the decade closed and Duane Allman hit his early teens he was becoming a very strong-willed individual, while developing an interest in the two main passions of his life: motorcycles and music. - Duane was a very, very intelligent fellow that had his own path. He had his own direction, he knew what he wanted to do. Even at that age he just walked to a different beat. - For many people who didn't know him well enough would probably think that he was directionless. I don't know too many people who had more direction than he did. He just didn't waste time talking with people about trying to make his decisions, it was already made in his mind. Gregg was still trying to find his own personality. We used to joke with him about being shy with the girls, all those types of things. He'd ask us our opinions about a lot of things, whereas Duane didn't ask your opinion about a lot of things. He would ask you whether you liked the music he liked, but that wasn't going to change his mind if you didn't. ("Three O'clock Blues" by BB King) - [Voiceover] And, the music Duane liked was being broadcast throughout the South by Nashville station WLAC. Through it's revolutionary night time Rhythm and Blues shows, four white DJs controversially played the work of John Lee Hooker, Bobby "Blue" Bland, BB King, and a host of other southern Blues and Gospel legends. - Number one, it was what they called a clear channel stations, at 1510 AM dial, covered the whole South, Midwest. Just had a tremendous market penetration. So, it was directed towards rural blacks and urban white males. And, every red-blooded southern boy turned into that every night. ♪I like it like that ♪Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho ♪Whoa babe ♪Yes, ma'am ♪Yes, ma'am ♪What you want babe? - You know, most of the local stations in the South they might have a few hours a day, or on Sunday they would play black Gospel and they'd be an hour or so of every broadcast day you could hear the Rock music, but on LAC you could hear it all: Howlin' Wood, BB King, Chuck Barry, all the Chess guys, and some obscure stuff Sunnyland Slim, Lightnin' Hopkins, Elmore James. ♪Mother said son you was born lucky ♪ But, remember you gotta die one day♪ ♪Whoa, yes you was born lucky ♪Remember you gotta die one day - That used to be one of our sayings, "WLAC in Nashville, Tennesee." We would listen a lot to the Blues, not many people listened to it. Your general population, kids our age they were more into the Surfer music, the Rock and Roll, that type of thing. And, not too many paid that much attention to the Blues, to Jazz. - [Voiceover] Inspired by the mysterious and soulful sounds emanating from WLAC first Gregg and then Duane learned to play the guitar, determined to master the techniques and recreate the songs that they were hearing. - I can't remember two people who connected with music like both of those guys, and in very different ways to me. Gregg still had other interests that he was involved in, and other things that he was following, but he was also teaching himself and sharpening his craft. Duane was music, music, music. I remember spending the night there sometimes over at the house and some guy that lived behind had a guitar and we would listen to him messing with it and he would sit there. And, any time he heard music, whether it was on the radio or live or whatever, just the focus, the concentration was phenomenal. - [Voiceover] By 1961, having sufficiently honed their skills the friends formed a band at Duane's suggestion, and began performing around the Dayton Beach area as the Uniques. - Duane sang a little bit, and Gregg sang a little bit. Ted Petrashannie who played piano for us on many of the gigs, he also sang, too. I did a little back up, but not much. (laughs) Just enough to holler every once in a while. We played at well, the Bandshell, which is close to where we are right now, we did a talent show there and we won that. We did school dances at the high school, at the junior high school. We played a couple of school assemblies, really rocked the place. And, as we were going we just played white teen dances, you know, all the young stuff, high school stuff all around town. - [Voiceover] And, this included parts of the town that other bands refused to enter. So enamored with the music of black Americans Duane ignored the social dictates of the time and regularly took his band into the world of Daytona Beach's African-American community. - Growing up in the South you're very aware of the conservative religious forces, and Duane and Gregg very much went against that. I mean, they were hanging out with black people, they were playing Blues and R&B music, which was black music. And, it sort of supercedes what society was mandating to be separate, and they actually came together. - Music speaks where words stop, you know, and I think that was a big thing was we didn't care what color your skin was or what language you spoke, it was just a simple matter of fact of, "Man, you can play," you know, "And, it sounds good." - We went over to Second Avenue, which is in, at that time we called it "Colored Town", to go to one of the pawn shops and buy our first shirts, and we all bought the same kind of shirts with the mother of pearl buttons on them. And, to us that was the normal thing to do. I don't remember having apprehension about going over there, but there were a lot of kids, as we grew up, that had nothing to do with the blacks and it was a problem at that time. - [Voiceover] What was also a problem was Duane's academic record. Afraid that his musical activities were interfering with her son's studies his mother enrolled him into a military academy, thus ending the Uniques. On his return in 1963 both Duane and Gregg briefly joined local band, The Houserockers, before starting their next outfit, The Escorts, the following year. Now, stronger musicians, despite still playing cover material, this band quickly rose to the top of the local scene. - What distinguished Duane and Gregg was their music was steeped in R&B and Blues, you know, they were doing Bobby Bland covers, Marvin Gaye covers, Motown. And, that's how you really set yourself apart by the songs you did cover, and no one else was really playing those kind of songs. - [Voiceover] Although the Daytona Beach scene in which they were thriving was relatively provincial and limited, in April 1965, the Escorts cemented their reputation by being chosen as a supporting act for the visiting Beach Boys. And, rather than molding their set to blend with the Surf Rock of America's biggest band, they stuck to their guns and delivered renditions of Marvin Gaye, James Brown, and Ray Charles numbers. - For a local band that was really great. Two of the local bands played before the Beach Boys came on. The Nightcrawlers was the other band, and that was probably the two most popular bands in Daytona Beach at that time, were those two. - It was really a unique set up because there was a band called The Nightcrawlers to the left, the Beach Boys were on the main stage, The Escorts were set off to the right. The Nightcrawlers would play a song, then The Escorts would play a song, back and forth. Then, for the finale, and I've heard a tape of this and it's incredible to hear, they did the Ray Charles tune What'd I Say. Nightcrawlers played a verse, then The Escorts played a verse, and this went on for six and a half minutes. - It was a great performance from 'em and as far as having people there, you know, you're used to playing in a small club with maybe 50 to 80, maybe 100 people and I don't know how many were there that night, but that's a first big stage opportunity that I'm aware of that they had, and they hit the note for sure. - [Voiceover] In the summer of 1965, after minor lineup changes The Escorts became the Allman Joys. Spotlighting themselves as the focus of the band, the brothers looked to spread their appeal beyond Daytona Beach. And, with Gregg freshly graduated from high school they could now dedicated themselves entirely to their music and turn professional. First becoming a resident band at a venue in Mobile, Alabama by 1966 the Allman Joys had begun to play in New York's thriving Greenwich Village. On their return to Daytona Beach in the summer they were local celebrities, and here they met future collaborator, Pete Carr. - I'd heard a lot about 'em. I had started playing at club called the Martinique, I was about 15, you know, and we would go and play. And, they had a picture of the Allman Joys in the club. And, they came back into town, when they started playing and, you know, they had a Bobby "Blue" Bland song, or Ray Charles, back then it was mostly copies, but they did a lot of Blues and R&B, plus a lot of Pop. And man, they could nail anything perfect. ♪I've got sunshine ♪On a cloudy day ♪When it's cold outside ♪I've got the month of May ♪Well, I guess you say ♪What can make me feel this way ♪My girl - That night I first met 'em, I walked up, Gregg came out and I walked up to him in front of the club with my guitar and said, "Hey man, come show me some licks. "You know, guitar, I hope you'll sit down with me." And he says, "That's my brother's department, "I'll introduce you to him." I said, "Okay." So, we went around the side of the building and he introduced me to Duane and we just (snaps fingers) clicked like that. We played a little bit, he talked, and from then on we all started becoming closer and closer friends. - [Voiceover] And, while back in Florida The Allman Joys also played a show with their closest rivals on the southern circuit, the 5 Men-Its, which featured guitarist and vocalist Eddie Hinton, drummer Johnny Sandlin, and guitarist and keyboard player Paul Hornsby. - The Allmans were the first band I knew that played music and did nothing else, that was their thing. They got blond hair down to their shoulders, I mean, you gotta remember in 1965 everybody still had crew cuts and slicked back hair and all this stuff. And, these guys were right on the cutting edge, visually and audibly. Gregg was maybe 17, 18 years old and he already had that huge husky voice, R&B, Blues voice. And, Duane was just playing like nobody I heard. Even though they were doing copy material there was something about the way they were doing 'em that nobody else did it. Duane could hear things nobody else could hear, things in songs. when you'd hear the Allman Joys being played you'd hear the same song we'd been playing, but they would be little things in there, you thought, "I'll be damned, I never even noticed that being in the record." And, guitar to Duane was just an extension of his body, it was like another arm. If he was sitting where I'm sitting today, there's no doubt he'd be holding a guitar in his hand. They'd be a guitar here and they'd be a book in his hand. And, he was an avid reader. And, he wasn't highly educated, never went to college. I don't think he had a high school diploma, but he was well read, very articulate, and had a vocabulary you wouldn't believe. He's there, he's reading, he'd lay that down and then he'd play guitar a little bit, and he's talking to you the whole time. And then, he'd pick that then he'd pick the book back up. He's reading and he's playing, anytime he's seated that's what's going on. So, it was his life, it was just what he was meant to do, playing that guitar. - [Voiceover] Later in 1966, Duane and the band travelled to his hometown of Nashville and caught the attention of esteemed song writer John D. Loudermilk. Seeing potential in the young band he took them under his wing, advising them how to compose their own original material, and also introducing them to Buddy Killen the head of Dial Records. This led to the band's lone single, Spoonful, the cover of the Willie Dixon song popularized by Howlin' Wolf. ("Spoonful" By The Allman Joys) - Duane had only been playing the guitar for three or four years. I mean, there's traces of the talent there, but really not to any greater degree than 100 other cover bands. It had yet to really jell and Duane had yet to really find his voice. ("Spoonful" By The Allman Joys) In my mind, The Allman Joy recordings is just kind of another cover band. And, you can hear, sort of, the roots of it but it really hadn't developed yet. - [Voiceover] Dial Records boss Buddy Killen agreed and the band were dropped. Uncertain of their future, and with their drummer headed to Viet Nam by early 1967 Duane and Gregg saw no sense in keeping their band going. Unbeknown to them, their friendly rivals the 5 Men-Its were in a similar situation. - [Duane] There's a guarded circuit of the South (coughs) that you work at and you make about $150 a week and eat pills and drink. (laughs) It's a bad trip, and so we just got sick of it man. You know, travelling around, playing in bars, man, you know. Man, for so long, and so finally we just said, "Well, this has been a lot of fun, but we're tired of it." You know, so we all quit. - One day Duane called me and he said, "Paul," he said, "How'd you like to have me and Gregg in your band?" And, I said, "What?" He said, "Yeah," he says, "Bill Cannell, our drummer "he's getting drafted, just got drafted "And, he's leaving us in a week, and we're letting "our bass player go. "And, it's just me and Gregg." I said, "Man, you couldn't have called at a better time." And so, there we had Duane and Gregg and me, Johnny Sandlin, and our bass player at that time was Mabron McKinney, who we called "The Wolf". And so, we said, "We're at the Sandlin's house, come on down "to the garage." - [Voiceover] The Hourglass was born, a fusing of the two strongest groups on the southern circuit. And, as with the other acts he had been a part of it was Duane Allman who quickly became the driving force behind the band. - When there was a Duane Allman in your band they was only room for one leader. Because, he was gonna do it his way and it wouldn't have mattered if you had another leader anyway. He wouldn't have listened to you, he had to do it his way. And, it was probably the best, you know, what he wanted to do. - [Voiceover] Within weeks the Hourglass were playing their first shows in Saint Louis, Missouri, where they met the visiting Californian Country Folk ensemble, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Hugely impressed by the Southern Rock outfit members of the band introduced the Hourglass to their manager Bill McCuen. - With the combined band of the Allman Joys and the Men-Its we were a powerhouse. Bill McCuen was floored when he heard us play and he went right to the pay phone, this was before cell phones, and called somebody at Liberty Records and said, "I have just discovered the next Rolling Stones." He said, "I found the greatest band in the world." And, he stayed over an extra day and talked to us and he said, "If you'll come to California I'd like to be "your manager and I'll get you a record deal." And, we thought about it for a while, mulled it over. I can't remember, it wasn't very long, a few days, maybe a week. And, he was on the phone back and forth to us. So, we decided to take him up on it, and we drove to L.A., a bunch of Alabama and Florida redneck boys, and here we were in L.A. in the Summer of Love, 1967. Nothing like it! ("The End" by The Doors) - [Voiceover] Arriving in a California overflowing with hippies, freaks, acid, and experimentation the band were initially well served by their new label, Liberty. Los Angeles and San Francisco were musical hotbeds, with the Folk rock of The Byrds and Love, coexisting with the psychedelia of The Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane and the craziness of Zappa and his Mothers of Invention. The Hourglass' first show took a place a week after they'd driven into L.A. in support of rising stars, The Doors. And soon, they were being regularly booked at the biggest venues on the scene. - We started opening right away. After the Doors we opened for The Grateful Dead and they got booed off the stage. We played first, they got booed off the stage, The Grateful Dead. And, we opened for Buffalo Springfield and countless other people. And, we went to San Francisco, played the Fillmore Auditorium. We opened for Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape, The Animals, and it was a big deal. I mean here we were, we were nobodies, but I'd hated to been the headline act following The Hourglass when we played. - [Voiceover] Despite firmly establishing themselves on the live circuit, in the studio The Hourglass struggled. The majority of the band making an impact with music steeped in the Blues at the time were British. And, California Pop label Liberty Records, and producer Dallas Smith in particular, were unwilling to acclimatize themselves to the sounds of the deep South. - They didn't know what a Southern Rock band's supposed to sound like. And, it was black, Blues based Rock and Roll. He kept referring to us as a Motown band. I said, "Well, we do black oriented music, but you got "the wrong side of the country. "It's Southern Blues, Southern Black Blues, "and, it's not Motown." But, at the first album he threw us in their and he produced it as Gregg Allman and the Hourglass sort of thing, he put horns behind everything we did. And, we didn't have any say so about it, it was an absolute dictatorship, and again, you don't dictate to Duane. And, he and the producer never got along well. And, most of the rest of us we were just glad to be anywhere, you know. What do we know? We're just a bunch of kids and these guys are a record company, and they're telling us what to do and we're going, "Yes sir, okay, all right." But, it wasn't turning out too well, we didn't like it. We weren't impressed by it. What we heard coming from the speakers and hearing these chicks and all the horns. I said, "Who is this? Is that supposed to be us?" - [Voiceover] Released in October 1967 and featuring only one original composition the the Hour Glass' self titled debut was unsurprisingly overlooked. ("Out of the Night" by Hour Glass) - I think the Hour Glass album, the first one, when you listen to that band what stuck out was the voice of Gregg Allman, this incredible voice from this kid. And so, Dallas Smith was interested in that kid. He didn't get what they were about, and I'm not sure they got what they were about yet. I know that they were reaching towards something, but they had so many issues to overcome, including the fact that one of the demands was "You just have to got through these songs on these tapes "that our company owns the publishing on," this is Liberty Records talking. And so, "You have to pick out some songs that'll work "for you because that's what you're gonna cut, "is stuff that we publish." And, so they had an awful lot stacked against them on that first album. ("Love Makes the World Go Round" by Hour Glass) - The irony of that first album was that was the period where guitar heroes were coming into full bloom. I mean, you had Clapton, Jimmy Page with The Yardbirds. And, they had a guy who was about to become a defining force in guitar playing, and they didn't let him play. - I just can't believe that they overlooked Duane. How could anybody hear, this guy is a genius. He's the greatest thing you've ever heard, and it's like they can't see through that, they can't see the forest for the trees. It's like they knew Gregg was a good singer, and Dallas Smith was just used to producing records in his fashion. That's the kind of records he'd been doing, and he had good luck with, He produced Jan and Dean, which was miles from what we were doing. This was Surf music. And, he produced Bobby Vee who was doing this kind of little bubble gum top 40 stuff. And, he sold records. He knew how to cut records that way, where you have a lead singer and you have back up guys. Duane was just a back up guy as far as he was concerned. - [Voiceover] Disappointed by their failure to capitalize on their live reputation before beginning a promotional tour Gregg returned to Daytona Beach where he hooked up with guitarist Pete Carr. - I was in Daytona when Gregg came home the Hour Glass' first album. And, when he was going back out he wanted to know if I wanted to come. I said, "Sure, yeah I'll go back out with you, "hang out with you guys, see what's going on out there. "See what we can do." I was there for a while just hanging out and their bass player one day just was gone, and they had a gig coming up at the Whiskey A Go-Go in a day or two. And, you know, they were kind of like, "What we gonna do?" And they asked me, said "Pete, would you play bass?" You know, I said, "Yeah, sure, sure I can play bass." I had study the session players making records like Stax and so, you know, I could do the basic bass, nothing fantastic, but I could do it. And so, we practiced a little bit and the next night we played at the Whiskey A Go-Go and it went great. - [Voiceover] Even if the Hour Glass hadn't captured their live sound on record yet, the Los Angeles music scene was introducing the young band members to new sounds, new possibilities, and an array of talented supporters. - Oh wow, there were so many things going on at that time. You know, we'd be playing at the Whiskey A Go-Go and upstairs, you know, Janis Joplin would come in, you know Paul Butterfield, Buffalo Springfield. Those guys really liked us, 'cause they'd seen us at the Filmore when we'd go down to San Francisco and play. And, they came in Whiskey A Go-Go and watch, you know, to hear us. They loved us. Neil Young actually did the liner notes to our second album. I mean, you never knew really, what was gonna go on. We were playing at a club, and I'm not sure what it was, but Frank Zappa came walking up and he was watching. And afterwards me and Duane went over and talked to him. And, he invited us to one of their rehearsals. So, the next day or two, whatever it was, we went to this little small kind of auditorium, had some seats and he had the band up there and he was like directing this thing note by note. And, you know, he wasn't just jamming he really was producing it, and writing it, and the whole deal. So, we sat there and watched him play and working on the songs, and he was really cool. ("Statesboro Blues" by Taj Mahal) - [Voiceover] Yet, for Duane the most influential artist on the scene was Taj Mahal, who at the time had just released his debut solo album. And, his version of the Blind Willie Mctell song Statesboro Blues, with Jesse Ed Davis on slide guitar was an inspiration. ("Statesboro Blues" by Taj Mahal) - We started doing Satesboro Blues in the Hour Glass for a long time. Taj Mahal came out with that album and Duane started picking it up there and we went to see him at the Troubador. And, watching him do it in person, you know, that even fired him up more. That was the first slide song we did. And, we got that down pretty good, you know, and of course later, he really took that to another level. Whatever he put his mind too, man he could concentrate and get on it, you know. - I'll tell you, somebody learning to play slide guitar is not a pleasant thing to be around. I'd rather hear cats fighting. And, we'd always carry an extra guitar around just for him to play, it was tuned up special for him to play on. And, we'd be riding in the car, or sitting around the apartment or something and he'd always be playing on that thing and we'd all run the other way. - [Voiceover] In January 1968, the Hour Glass returned to the studio, this time given greater independence by Liberty Records, and armed with a number of original compositions. Yet, Dallas Smith remained the producer and within a short amount of time the band became frustrated with his Pop sensibilities and Duane Allman abandoned the project. - Duane walks out of the studio in the middle of the album. He hadn't even laid down his lead tracks and he goes home to Daytona. He quit the band. He doesn't like what's going on with Dallas Smith so he just up and leaves. So, by this time Pete Carr was playing bass with us and he was the youngest member of our band, he was from Daytona. And, he was also a very good guitar player and so we recruited him in there to play all of Duane's parts. So, we spent a week or two, I don't remember just how long, about a week or two Pete overdubbing and replacing everything Duane had done. And then, all of a sudden Duane comes back like, "Hey, what's happening?" - [Voiceover] Deciding to complete his work on the album Duane's guitar was this time far more present. Yet, the LP Power of Love, released in March 1968 was poorly promoted and proved another disappointment for the Hour Glass. - We had more original tunes and the songs were worked up and Duane's parts were, it was important to the songs, so that's what we brought to the table. And, we were ready to go with them, instead of just walking in and having your... Unlike the first album where they just picked out a bunch of demos out of a box and said, "Okay, how do you like this one for your record? "You don't like it, okay we'll play you this one. "Here, you're gonna cut this." Whereas the second album we did more worked up tunes, but it still just wasn't good enough. ("I Can Stand Alone" by Hour Glass) - For the time, I think it's a good Blue Eyed Soul album. We got to do more of what we wanted to do, you know, not totally but... And, at the same time you can't, I've heard, you know, people put it down say this da, da, da. But really, that's kind of where we were at at the time. I mean, it wasn't like three years before that they were doing, you know, Mustang Sally in a night club doing cover songs. We hadn't really gotten the writing down great yet. It was just one of those times, though, wasn't ready to go yet, you know, just wasn't ready to happen yet. - [Voiceover] Unable to see any future in working in L.A. studios under Dallas Smith the band considered their next move. In rural Alabama they knew of a recording venue that has slowly built a formidable reputation for its unique sound, Rick Hall's FAME studios in Muscle Shoals. Paul Hornsby and drummer Johnny Sandlin had previously recorded there during their time in the 5 Men-Its. And, with few options available the decided to capture the Hour Glass sound on their home turf. - We thought, we saved a few bucks from a few of our gigs and we went in and rented the studio in Muscle Shoals at FAME studios, actually. "Let's cut a few things here, take it back and show them "where we're going, what we wanna do." - We loved it, you know, we thought and we loved the studio and the sound of the studio, what we got out of it. And, you know, we were kinda high after that on the few little things we did cut there. (Sweet Little Angel" by Hour Glass) ♪I've got a sweet little angel ♪I love the way ♪She spreads her wings - Hearing the recordings they did there, it just transformed them as a band. You know, the BB King Medley. I mean, all of a sudden there's Duane Allman on lead guitar playing like no one you've really ever heard before. And, Gregg singing the Blues, I mean, that was his home. That's where he felt most comfortable, that's where he belonged. - In the Hour Glass Muscle Shoals demos I hear pretty much what the band wanted to be and what Duane wanted the band to be as their leader. If you listen to the BB King Medley, I mean, it's got as much energy as any Blues performance that I've ever heard. It was driving on so many different levels, and you could feel that Duane's vision was actually coming to fruition. ♪I bought you a new Ford ♪You said I wanna a Cadillac ♪Bought you a ten dollar dinner ♪You said thanks for the snack - I knew we could play music. I was beginning to doubt it listening to some of the stuff that they turned out in L.A.. We carried it back, just waiting for them. And they heard it and they thought, "This is crap." They thought, "This is the worst thing we've ever heard." And, we just kind of looked at each other like, "Man, what are you gonna do?" - If we came out with that I think, and people would have hear that, they would have said, "These guys "can do this stuff good, man." I mean, they're like, "The Stones? Listen to this." You know, "They're doing the Blues." You know, it was, it was great, I think. And, we took them and played it, you know, for Dallas the producer of the band. He, I mean, was like, "Oh, it stinks." But, he was producing people like Bobby Vee, stuff like that. I mean, hey it's okay, but you know, I mean it's not a band like we were, or we wanted to be, or we sensed we could be. 'Cause, we didn't really know. And, the management really didn't know how to handle what we could do. - [Voiceover] The rejection of the demos proved the final straw. And, after a run of shows at the Whiskey A Go-Go in June 1968 the majority of Hour Glass left Los Angeles. - That was the end of the whole deal, 'cause this was our dream, this was the way we wanted to sound. We were never going to get that and we were up against a wall. And, it wasn't two or three months, we were gone. But, Duane made the break start. He says, "I'm going back east, I can't take this no more." - It was at the end of its cycle out there. I remember me and I don't know when it was, what day, what happened but finally came a point I remember Duane and I riding back in a van from California to Florida, you know, without an air conditioner. Lord have mercy, we didn't know any better back that day, I guess. - We pulled out of L.A. and we tried to keep the band going for a little while, and here we were back in the same old clubs. And, Alabama, they were still wanting to hear Mustang Sally, and Midnight Hour. And I thought, "Man, we've just been in L.A., we've been "blowing bands off the stage and they want to hear "this crap back here." We were very discouraged, and broke, and trying to book our own shows, and it fell apart. - [Voiceover] By August, Duane was back in Daytona Beach. Dismissing the Hour Glass experience he immediately linked up with young drummer Butch Trucks, a musician he knew from the Allman Joys' days, and briefly joined his band The 31st of February. The Florida scene was stagnant however, and without any immediate opportunites Duane decided to head for FAME studios to look for work as a session musician. Yet, owner Rick Hall was intially unsure of the young guitarist. - He had to be convinced. He had to prove himself to Rick, and he did. And, the thing about Duane was he was such a astute player and you've heard the old saying, "I hear the song one time and I know it." Well, he was that way. And, very few guys I knew could do that. He didn't really read our charts. And, we all played on number charts, but it's pretty amazing to see him just listen down and nail it on the first pass. - [Voiceover] Duane began playing sessions as a lead guitarist, but where the members of the Muscle Shoals rhythm section had been honing their craft in the studio for years the obsession with which Allman approached music was a revelation to them. - Duane was completely impressive. I've never seen a more dedicated, hands on the guitar probably ten hours a day. And, he wouldn't be in a gig, I mean he just lived with it. - He wanted to play all the time. I mean, when we got through with our work we all went home, Duane would stand around in that studio all night. And, he wasn't married, didn't have a home to go to, really. So, he lived it, and we had regular lives besides our studio work. We would go home and eat supper, or see the wife, or whatever, you know. So, it was different. He looked at us like insurance salesmen. - [Voiceover] Since 1966 FAME had become the studio of choice for Jerry Wexler's Atlantic Records artists. The first of these to work with Duane Allman was Wilson Pickett, the R&B singer whose classic hit In the Midnight Hour had been a staple of the Hour Glass set over the previous two years. Bucking the conventions of the studio heirarchy during a lunch break Duane suggested that Pickett should consider recording a version of the Beatles current hit Hey Jude. The resulting recording would prove life changing for the young guitarist. - Duane had hair down to here. And, of course, Wilson being black, had a little problem of going to restaurants here. But, the long hairs had more of problem than black folks, believe it or not. And so, they stayed back just to not get the looks. Well, while they were here Duane talked him into doing Hey Jude and it was quite an effort I understand. He fought it at first, big time. But, by the time, you know, we got back in and the first song we cut was Hey Jude. ♪Hey Jude, don't make it bad ♪Take a sad song and make it better ♪Remember to let her into your heart ♪Then you can start ♪To make it better ♪Hey Jude - Rick and Jerry Wexler would have songs picked and that was something you didn't mess with. And so, that was pretty unusual that Duane would go to Wilson and say, "Hey, you need to cut Hey Jude." Especially since it was already on the charts with the Beatles, you know, whoever heard of cutting something while something else was still on the charts? But, it was a brilliant idea. - You the vamp on the end, that happened automatically. It just developed into that ending which was an incredible, intense ending. Well, Duane started playing those incredible, incredible licks that he's noted for. And, nobody'd ever heard that from him before and when we got through it was like kind of a shocked thing, we didn't want to stop playing. ("Hey Jude" by Wilson Pickett) - There were no lead guitars on Soul records, none. It was saxophones if there was a solo. And, not only did he suggest it and Wilson Pickett agreed to do it, but it was the moment that changed Duane Allman's world. It was so out of context for a Soul record that you couldn't help but take note of it. He played underneath Wilson Pickett's voice on the fade out and it's incredible to listen to even now, you know, forty or fifty years later. ("Hey Jude" by Wilson Pickett) - He obviously had something going on. He was young, he was white, he was deeply, incredibly soulful. And, he had chops to burn. That performance kicked open the door for him, and led to everything that followed. - Really, if you wanna boil everything down that's pretty much the embryo of, you know, of the whole Southern Rock scene because that's when Phil Walden first heard Duane Allman. - [Voiceover] Phil Walden was a major figure on the southern scene, a booking agent and manager who'd worked with the biggest names in Soul and R&B. His most significant association had been with Otis Redding, who he had managed since 1959. But, since the singer's tragic death in 1967 his passion for music had diminished. - Otis Redding and he were really close, like brothers, you know? And, when Otis Redding died, you know, Phil Walden he produced shows and he managed musicians, he was devastated, you know? That was his friend, and not only his friend but it was his meal ticket. I mean, he really was making, you know, his living off of R&B, you know Southern R&B. And, he was kind of aimless at the time. He didn't like white Rock music, never did. And then, with the assassination of Doctor Martin Luther King, Junior when fewer black artists wanted to work with white managers for political reasons he felt kind of aimless. - He heard Hey Jude. He heard that guitar player. He called in his assistant and said, "You gotta come "listen to this. "Find out who this guy is." So, they called Muscle Shoals and found out it was a kid named Duane Allman. If you look at the logic of it, there is no logic. Duane Allman couldn't sing. He didn't have a band. He didn't write songs. He was a guitar player. And yet, Phil Walden signed him to a deal. I mean, how visionary is that? - He was again one of that breed of young, white, hip southern guys who had the musical influences. I'm sure he listened to WLAC, like we all did. And, of course, he had that tremendous experience with black bands. He started booking them in college when he was a fraternity guy. But, he knew that market, at one time he had the biggest R&B black booking agency in the south, but it was all white guys running it. But, Capricorn Records was originally gonna be a Soul label, but of course, Otis Redding passed. And then, Phil got interested in Duane and it turned into the premier Southern Rock label. I mean Phil Walden has had his clashes with the band and there's been varying opinions, but there would never have been an Allman Brothers Band without Phil Waldon, no question about it. - [Voiceover] Waldon wasn't the only industry heavy weight captivated by the talent on display in Hey Jude. Jerry Wexler, head of Atlantic records was equally awestruck by Allman's performance on the single. And, as soon as he became aware of the young guitarist's new management deal he bought out his recording contract from Rick Hall. Despite all this sudden attention, Duane himself was recording sessions in Muscle Shoals with a who's who of R&B and Soul artists, from Arthur Connelly, and Clarence Carter, to King Curtis, and Aretha Franklin, but finding that the world of the studio musician was incompatible with his own lifestyle. - He didn't fit the normal studio player at all. He was the first kind of hippy looking guy to come through. And, he just was free as a bird. - He was free, he was a free spirit. Now, he was the kind of guy that he didn't have any ties holding him down. And, even his job with us kind of held him down a little bit. But, he was the kind guy that you could walk up to and say, "Hey, let's go to L.A. tonight." He'd say, "Hell, let's go," and they'd just go. I don't even think they'd go get their clothes, nothing. They'd just get in the car, or whatever and go. (laughs) And, none of us had ever met anybody like that. - We were all married, some of us had kids, had a mortgage or a rent payment or a car payment or something. He just didn't like that at all, he thought that was crazy. I don't know if he thought we'd sold out, but he just thought that's just a regular straight guy's job there. - [Duane] Studios, that's a terrible thing, man. You just lay around and you get your money, man. All those studio cats that I know, man, one of them gets a color TV, you see, and then the next day, man, they're all down to Sears or, you know, wherever and , "Hey man, I'd like to look at some colored TVs." You know, it's sickening, man. They're just keeping up with the Joneses, they're not playing the music. They're stuff sounds like crap now. I was down there working with them for about a half a year and I got sick of it, man. - I think he always thought band, that he would want to get back to Gregg and to the band stuff, you know. Like the Allman Joys, the way they started out, you know? And, I think that was his comfort zone. But, he was so good at playing on sessions that he was a delight to have on sessions. And, all the artists loved him. What he added to any record he played on, you know, I think he was appreciated. ("The Road of Love" by Clarence Carter) - When he did sessions he didn't tend to really blend into the background. I mean, you were getting Duane Allman, but people responded to that. You know, he became great friends with King Curtis, played on King Curtis' version of The Weight, played on Aretha Franklin's version of The Weight. For Duane Muscle Shoals gave him the opportunity to do things he had never done before, to play a lot of different kinds of music, to learn how to record in the studio, to learn how to do arrangements, to learn how to back up a singer. And, it really was for him kind of like going to college, because he got a wealth of experience that he wouldn't have gotten if he'd stayed in Florida playing in The 31st of February or a cover band. - [Voiceover] As important as the numerous sessions were as a learning experience however, Allman's burning ambition to become an artist in his own right remained constant. - One time we were in New York and we went to see Johnny Winter. And, I remember we were sitting up in one of the balconies there at the Filmore and Duane told me, he says, but he didnt say this in a way... I knew what he meant. He said, "I can cut him." And, he knew he could, and I knew he could. Duane told me then, that night, he said, "This time next year I'll be down there on that stage," and he was. - [Voiceover] The first steps towards releasing Allman from his life as a studio muscian began to take shape in January 1969. Jerry Wexler and Phil Walden decided that Duane should record demos for a solo album at FAME studios, handling both guitar and vocal duties, and began looking for musicians to back him. Walden also had ambitions to build his own studio in his hometown of Macon, Georgia, and had already brougth in Jazz drummer Jai Johanny Johanson, better known as Jaimoe, who had been part of Otis Redding's touring band in 1966. Walden sent him to Muscle Shoals to meet the young guitarist while Allman himself called in bassist Berry Oakley who he knew from a Jacksonville band Second Coming. Despite the success of the initial sessions with these new players, Duane also required familiar faces to add to the line up. - One day I got a call from Duane and he said. "Hornsby "I'm in Muscle Shoals, I'm cutting sessions up here. "And, they've heard some of my playing and these people "at Atlantic like what I'm doing and they want me to "cut some demos, and they think they might want "to sign me or something. "Would you come up and play on some demos with me?" And, he wanted that, he liked more of the Hour Glass sound that we had. And so, I went up and Johnny Sandlin's there and Berry Oakley was there that day. So, Berry Oakley wound up playing on the demos so it was this whole thing was featuring Duane. Fianlly, he gets to step out. But, more than being a guitar player they wanted him to sing, too. And, Duane just wasn't a singer. He could have been, but I don't think he wanted it. I think it bored him. You know, he wanted to play guitar. ♪I've had my fun ♪If I don't ever get well no more ♪I've had my fun ♪If I don't ever get well no more - The tracks that really stand out to me are Goin' Down Slow, just 'cause the emotion in Duane's playing and in his vocals. People who knew Duane will tell you that he lived his life as if it was gonna end too soon. And, that song really tapped into something that was almost mystical and magical. ("Goin Down Slow" by Duane Allman) - Aside from his voice he had made some steps, but it just had not been completed yet with the birth of The Allman Brothers Band, but you can definitely see that he had made yet another progression in what his vision was for the music that he wanted to play. - [Voiceover] The sessions ground to a halt. Not only was Allman uncomfortable as the vocalist he was also unable to convince ex-Hour Glass collegues Paul Hornsby and Johnny Sandlin to join this new ensemble. Berry Oakley on the other hand was bound by loyalty to band Second Coming, and in particular their guitarist Dickie Betts, and returned to Jacksonville. Again left with few options Duane decided to hand in his notice at FAME studios and set off with Jaimoe to Florida to convince Oakley to leave his band. With The 31st of February drummer Butch Trucks also in tow, he arrived at the Second Comings band house on March 20th, 1969, for an improptu jam. - There was Duane, Dickie Betts, Berry Oakley, Jaimoe, Butch Trucks, and Reese Wynans who was the organ player for Second Coming. And, he would later play with Stevie Ray Vaughn, so he was no slouch. And, they started a little shuffle. It lasted about three hours. And, when they stopped Duane went to the door and said, "Anyone who's not gonna be in my band "you've gotta fight your way out of here." And, that was the day the Allman Brothers Band was born. A couple weeks later Gregg came in and it went from there. - [Voiceover] Gregg Allman's time in California had been far from successful. After recording a number of songs for Liberty Records, of which only two were released to little attention, it was clear that without a fully formed band to feed off of, his talents would go unnoticed. Initially reluctant to left go of his California dream three days after the first jam of the future Allman Brothers Band Gregg joined the group in Florida. In an era of power trios and quartets, Duane Allman had assembled an unusually large ensemble. Yet, this time he was sure that it was the perfect unit to realize his musical vision. - You're talking about a guy whose father died when he was a child. You're talking about a guy who is constantly in search of some kind of family. And so, the family for him became a musical family, to the point that he had all these guys in the band, including one who was black and he still referred to them as The Allman Brothers Band. He wasn't talking about just him and Gregg. Obviously, there's no Duane today and it's still The Allman Brothers Band. He was searching for brothers on a broader scale. He wanted to create a family unit, and I think that was what his music was about as well. That's why I don't think it woulda worked with just him and a couple of other guys. He wanted the group, he wanted something more powerful. The B3, the other lead guitarist, as crazy as that was, the two drummers instead of just one. All these things, maybe he was over compensating like crazy, but it worked out great. - I can't imagine any player they had in that first band that didn't belong there. I just don't know how it could have been any better, or anybody else they coulda chosen that coulda done a better job. So, you had six people out there just slaying it. Duane is part of it, it's a unit, it's not just a lead guitar player out front. It's not just a lead singer. This whole thing was one big glob of power, you know. (soft rock music) - [Voiceover] And, with a new band came a change of scene. Phil Walden had set up his new studios in Macon, Georgia and when Jerry Wexler expressed doubts over how to place this act on his Atlantic roster Walden decided to form a record company on which to launch them. Capricorn records was born, and the newly named Allman Brothers Band headed out to Macon from Florida. A small city untouched by the counterculture it became the groups base of opertations with purpose built recording facilities, communal houses, a large cemetary where they would get stoned, and a local Soul Food restaurant where they became regulars. - When the Allman brothers were in Los Angeles they were kind of being pushed around by the industry. And, they made good music, you know. but they didn't make the music they wanted to make and they didn't make the music that would change the world. That music would never change the world, it was good music but it wouldn't change the world, and The Allman Brothers Band did. When they were in Macon, they were making music that sounded like that area, they felt comfortable in that area. That group of people who were the Allman Brothers, you know, you had a drummer that had played with Otis Redding, you had a guitar player, Dickie Betts, who was really into Country Music, you had Gregg Allman who was an R&B singer deluxe Soul with lots of Gospel in his blood. You had all this mix of guys in the south where they could go next door to the Soul Food restaurant and order, you know, collard greens and black eyed peas, and then go back home to their big ole house, you know, in this small town and make the music they wanted to make, so that was crucial. - Macon wasn't like all the other towns around. You could get killed in Atlanta, you could get killed in Birmingham, Tuscaloosa any of these places. You had to be very careful. But, Macon, you know, everybody had that just kind of that little laid back vibe, you know. Didn't see too much racial turmoil and they didn't harass hippies too bad. - Originally, when they lived in a house on College Street, which is near where the first album photos were made, and they were pretty much a spectacle. I mean, cars circled the block to see the hippies sitting out in front of their house, because they didn't look like late sixties southern boys. (laughs) So, there was a bit of culture shock here, but there was never any hostility or, you know, animosity. It was just kind of a bewilderment by the locals. - [Voiceover] While the group's members settled into their southern enclave the musical climate was changing in a way that would benefit the band. After the heady excesses of psychedelia and well meaning flower power the counterculture was facing harsher resistance from the establishment, and, this in part led its musical figure heads into a search for roots, from the Stones and the Birds, to Dylan and the Band this search led them to reconsider the American South and the various musical forms that had emerged from it. - By the late 60s when the Allman Brothers got together and started working on that first album American culture had changed and it was all of a sudden pretty popular to be southern and Country and R&B and all that stuff again. You had people like Gram Parsons who was a southerner in California talking up Country music. And, you know, there was this fascination with Country music all of a sudden in Los Angeles particularly. You know, you had Country Rock coming from the Flying Burrito Brothers, which was Gram Parson's band, you had Country Rock coming from The Birds, which Gram Parsons, you know, had a big impact on and played with on one album. Dylan was recording in Nashville. The Band had formed and they had a great song writer in Robbie Robertson who could actually spin a narrative about the South. I mean, the South was fascinating, even Joan Baez, who had been such a strong protest singer against what was going on in the South did The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, a beautiful song from the perspective of a confused Confederate soldier. You know, who knew that Joan Baez would do that? And then, Joan Baez started even incorporating, you know, pedal steel guitar into her own country albums. So, all of a sudden eyes were looking back to the South for musical guidance. - [Voiceover] And, it was into this climate that The Allman Brothers Band emerged. In stark contrast to the Hour Glass experience Phil Walden had given the group free reign artistically. And, the music they developed throughout 1969 at small venues and free outdoor shows across the South was steeped in the Blues, R&B, and Soul. By August they had entered Atlantic studios in New York to record their debut LP, and though it wasn't a huge commercial hit upon its release, it turned the heads of many influential critics. After years of false starts Duane Allman's artist vision had finally been realized. - I remember hearing that first song on released album for the first time when I put the record on I was hooked. I thought, "Wow, this deep and dark and soulful, "and these guys can really play." There was something authoritative about it. It's a brand new band, but they seemed to know something that I wanted to know. ♪I've been run down ♪I've been lied to ♪I don't know why ♪I let that mean woman make me out a fool ♪She took all my money ♪Wrecks my new car ♪Now she's one of my good time buddies ♪They're drinkin' in some cross town bar ♪Sometimes I feel ♪Sometimes I feel like I've been tied ♪To the whipping post ♪Tied to the whipping post ♪Tied to the whipping post ♪Good lord, I feel like I'm dyin'♪ - The music the Allman Brothers were making it came from the same influences as groups like Led Zepplin, but the British bands tended to be a little more bombastic, a little more thudding, whereas the Allman Brothers were a lot smoother, a little bit softer. The Allman Brothers is very much a band of dynamics. They knew enough to lay back when necessary. And, they knew enough to bring it on when they needed to. ("Dreams" by The Allman Brothers Band) ♪Just one more mornin' ♪I had to wake up with the blues ♪Pulled myself outta bed, yeah ♪Put on my walkin' shoes ♪Went up on the mountain - Dreams to me is about the most fascinating song the band ever recorded. That's a song that's like seven minutes long but it never feels seven minutes long. It feels like it's there and then it's over. And, I've never had another song do that to me, but Dreams is one of those things where those guys on that day, at that moment captured something that nobody's ever captured in a studio before. And, that one song is the one that fascinates me most of everything they ever recorded, because it's just so unique and ethereal. - It's basically one lick droning, but it's very hypnotic, and Duane's solo especially on that track, I mean, he starts out playing regular finger guitar on the lead, and then suddenly shifts into slide. ("Dreams" by The Allman Brothers) It's like Coltrane picking up the soprano sax, you know, it just takes it to a whole different place. - [Voiceover] The first southern band of the era had arrived and album's release marked a turning point in American music. When acts from below the Mason Dixon line finally began to make their presence felt on the national consciousness. - This was gonna happen, it was an unnatural situation to cut off a good quarter of the country and an enormous treasure house of music from Pop music in general. And also, our belief in the North that all white people were racists simply wasn't true. And, there were plenty, plenty, plenty millions of white kids in the South who read the papers, read Life magazine, saw all these and started doing the same thing, but imitated it because they wanted to be hip, too. So, it was an organic process of which the Allman Brothers happened to pick up on early and to come up with a good musical concept. - [Voiceover] By 1970, the band were broadening their scope and played their first west coast shows while continuing to develop their live sound. Yet, their equalibrium was thrown off balance when road manager Twiggs Lyndon was arrested and charged with murder for stabbing to death a club owner. With the bad now attracting offers from booking agents across the country a replacement was quickly found, Lyndon's close friend Willie Perkins. - The night I got hired Duane Allman sat down with me in their Winnebago camper that they traveled in and said, "Look, Twigg said you could do this job. "We want you to do it, but I'm warning you "We are the craziest blankity blanks "you'll ever run into. "And, if you can do it fine, but be warned." And, it was kind of a culture shock for me. I was working at a commercial bank, so I had short hair and I didn't look anything like them, but I thought like them. And, it worked out fine. Originally, some of the band members were a little put off by me because I was more of a disciplinarian, you know, than then had been used too. And Duane said, "Look, stick with this guy, "he's gonna be an asset," which was very kind of him. And, it worked out. - [Voiceover] In Macon, Duane's desire to form a musical family was further strengthened by a change of accomodation. He, Gregg, Berry Oakely, and their respective partners moved to a large three story property on Vineville Avenue. This would become their base of operations, the big house. - Not all the bad members lived here, but everybody came and went, it was the meeting place. When we left town we left from here, and when the band rehearsed they rehearsed downstairs here. And, we partied here, so it was the place. - It was truly a sense of family, in a way that especially Duane and Gregg had never really had because it was just them and their mom. And, this was a very communal situation, everybody supported each other, helped each other. And, it really helped build that foundation the Allman Brothers had of the brotherhood. You know, it was all for one and one for all and that was very true for them. You know, they really felt that way. - [Voiceover] Adding to this sense of belonging was the spread of countercultural ideas through the South. When they had arrived in Macon the small group of musicians had been curiosities, but in the new decade of more liberal outlook and freer attitudes and lifestyles meant that there was a fan base growing on their doorstep. The first show under road manager Willie Perkins reign was the biggest the band had played so far, The Atlanta Pop Festival. And, it was here that they would perform to this new southern audience. Yet, Duane Allman came close to missing this huge opportunity. - Duane was in Miami doing some sessions, but he said, "Don't worry, I'll be there I'm driving up. "I'll be done, I'll be there in plenty of time." Well, it was 20 or 30 minutes before the band was on, no cell phones in that day. All I knew was that it was almost time to play and Duane wasn't there. Well, he had gotten, in driving up in his car, he had gotten caught in the interstate highway was like a parking lot. He just couldn't get there, so he commandered a guy on a motorcycle and hopped on the back seat, they went down the shoulder of the road. And, I'm standing there wringing my hands and I'd been on the job a month and, you know, this is the biggest gig and there's no Duane. But, he just drives up to the back gate, calmly and my heart calms down. He walks in, picks up his guitar and played the gig. - [Voiceover] This gig, along with the Love Valley Festival in North Carolina two weeks later was of enormous importance to both the group and to the region. Not only did it showcase The Allman Brothers Band in front of hundred of thousands of young music fans, the mass racially mixed audience itself demonstrated to the rest of the world that once untrustworthy white South had, with this new generation, turned a corner. - It was huge and it was the small hippie culture of the South being thrown in with the young, white, to coin a phrase redneck population. And it worked, it was fine. - Love Valley and the Atlantic Pop Fest were massively, massively important in introducing kind of this new South, this new, and I don't mean that in the new economics South sense, I mean this new, underground, counterculture South. And, you know, the South is always a little bit late in coming to these things. It was late to Punk Rock, you know, it was late to, you know, counterculture stuff. I mean, because that stuff is kind of born on the west coast, or New York, and London. It was hugely important, you know. You had a bunch, a bunch, a bunch, a bunch of people, you know, with their shirts off and their shoes off, and long hair, and you know, with southern accents. You know, being very different from, again, those images of severe looking guys with hoses on black people, you know, it wasn't about that. The generation gap was an important issue, you know, everywhere during that period. It was particularly poignant in the South. If you were a young southerner who didn't buy that party line, that had been force fed you and, you know, for, you know, decades, you know, your family, or your dad, your dad's dad, your dad's dad's dad. You know, this racism had come, you know, from generations and it was very, very intense. So, that generation gap there was particularly intense. So, you broke away from that and you see, you know, dad is a moonshine sipping, beer drinking, hell raising, PBR raising, you know guy in a pool bar, you know, making racist jokes. That's very different from the long haired hippie sittin' at a rock festival listening to The Allman Brothers smoking a little dope, talking about, you know, Kierkegaard. - [Voiceover] And, like the culture of the South, the group itself was evolving further. Drummer Jaimoe Johannson had introduced his bandmates to a whole genre of music that they were mostly unaware of, Jazz. This would have a major impact on the development of their sound. And Duane in particular, found a wealth of new artists and musical ideas to inspire him. - [Duane] The complexity, I suppose, is the difference between Blues and Jazz. That's the only difference 'cause it's all the portrayal of the feelings in the soul in a medium other than words. Miles Davis does the best job, man, to me of portraying the innermost subtlest, softest feelings in the human psyche. And, he does it beautifully, he's a fascinating talent and marvellous, marvellous man and a great entertainer. ("So What" by Miles Davis) - Jaimoe grew up listening to Jazz. Before he met Duane Allman his plan was to move to New York and join a Jazz band. Duane and Gregg grew up steeped in the Blues, but they had really no exposure to Jazz, none of them did, really. Jaimoe turned everyone on to Kind of Blue by Miles Davis, to Coltrane and Duane especially was just fascinated by that. - [Duane] This is John Coltrane probably one of the finest, most accomplished, tenor players and took his music farther than anybody I believe I ever heard. I wanna play one of his records before we go. And, it's a little bit farther out than the Miles we just played, but I believe anyone that will just sit and listen will really enjoy it, it's a magnificent work. This is, "My Favorite Things". ("My Favorite Things" by John Coltrane) - The Jazz that the Allman Brothers were playing was very primative, but became very complicated very fast because one of the things about Duane was he was an incredibly quick learner. If he got fascinated by something he learned how to do it and he learned how to do it fast, slide guitar perhaps being the most obvious, but yeah Jaimoe had a record collection. And, you know, when you're a teenager, early 20s you want to see everybody's record collection if it's 1969, or whatever. That's what you had, you had your record collection. And so, Duane would have been flipping through these records seeing all these artists he's never heard of before in his life and saying, "I gotta hear this, I gotta see "what this is about." And, once he did hear Miles and Coltrane and these other artists it was obviously going to be interpolated into what he was doing because he was fascinated by it. ("Call It Anything" by Miles Davis) I believe it was in 1969 that Miles Davis brought his Bitches Brew band into the Fillmore East. ("Call It Anything" by Miles Davis) - The exotic nature of Miles' band on stage at the FIllmore given that context was like it was like music from another planet. There were also at, you know, at the very other extreme there were horn bands, forgotten ones like Pacific Gas and Electric, and Chicago Transit Authority to a certain extent, that were bringing elements of Jazz into this Rock framework. That stuff seemed as safe as Miles seemed wild and crazy. The Allmans slid into this area between those two extremes. It was easy to like them live. And, that was really what did it for the Allmans, especially in New York. I mean, they broke out in New York, really. - [Voiceover] The band's popularity on the east coast was hard won. Although they had been playing in both New York and Boston since July 1969 their elongated musical odysseys initially met with resistance from promoters and booking agents. - I can remember one time in Boston we went to a presentation where bands would come play for all the college buyers and they said, "You got fifteen minutes." And I said, "Well, you know, we don't get one song "done in 15 minutes." So, that was what we were up against. It was definitely not a band that made three minute singles. - [Voiceover] The decisive factor in their east coast success was Bill Graham, the charismatic promoter who operated the Fillmore West in San Francisco and the Fillmore East in New York City. He had been crucial in establishing counterculture artists such as The Grateful Dead, Big Brother and The Holding Company, and the Jefferson Airplane. Having already booked the Hour Glass for shows in 1967 Graham was well aware of Duane and Gregg's talent and by 1970 The Allman Brothers Band became regulars at his clubs. - He was quite a personality and he was an actor by trade. So, he was very theatrical in his business dealings, but always top drawer. He was an early and ardent supporter of the band both on the east and west coasts, so that was a big, big help. - For a while Bill Graham was all they had. And, there weren't a lot of other concert facilities. There was the Warehouse in New Orleans, Tea Party in Boston. Bill Graham exposed them to the audiences that counted in San Francisco and New York City. The Allman Brothers were so exotic, so different and their music was so warm and so inviting that people just fell in love with it because no concert was ever like the one before it. It was always different, something new always happened. - [Voiceover] While developing an ardent live following the band had also begun work on their sophmore album. Where their debut had seen them uprooted to New York to record, this time they remained in the South and travelled to Criteria studios in Miami. Here they were paired with Tom Dowd, a producer who had made his name recording many of their influences including Ray Charles and John Coltrane, and the Criteria House Engineers, the Albert Brothers. - We were doing a lot of R&B at the time. We were doing Aretha Franklin, we were doing James Brown, Brook Benton, you know, those kind of acts. So, when those kind of southern, well the Allman Brothers were the first really southern band that came into town, we were kind of like scratching our heads. We weren't sure what that was, you know, 'cause we were used to tight drum sounds and tight bass sounds and they were kind of a loose band, more or less, especially with two drummers and a percussion player. It was different than we were used to hearing. - The Allmans were the totally most unique thing that we'd ever come across. Not because they had a black dummer, but because they had two drummers, not because they had the greatest guitar player in opinion in Duane Allman, they had two guitar players. Dickie Betts was as important a player as Duane was in the band. And, now you've got Berry Oakley who plays this amazing melodic bass, but is just locked into the rhythm section with Butch Trucks and Jaimoe. All the pieces began to add up to this phenomenon and then suddenly you're implanting a B3, which at that point I don't think we've ever heard a B3 sound in Rock and Roll. And, you've got Gregg Allman is this blue-eyed, blond haired Soul singer who was just an incredible vocalist in front of this band, but hiding behind the B3. Who could ever imagine a group like this? It was really unique. ("Revival" by The Allman Brothers Band) - [Voiceover] And although Duane was the band's leader and guiding force, when Idlewild South released in September 1970 these other band members, shone just as brightly. As song writers Gregg Allman and Dickie Betts in particular developed both the band's repertoire of more accessible material with the lengthy excursions that served them so well live. - Duane had a lot of attention because he was doing other things besides just being one of the guitar players in the Allman Brothers. He was playing sessions with Aretha Franklin, with Wilson Pickett. There was more attention put towards Duane and rightfully so because he was such a phenomenal player but that should not in any way, shape, or form, in my opinion, take anything away from Dickie or Gregg because without Dickie and Gregg there was no Allman Brothers. It's not just Duane. In that environment everyone has their particular place in time. I can remember when we did Midnight Rider, Gregg came in the studio one day, it was a little earlier in the day, maybe 12, 1 o'clock in the afternoon, none of the other guys were there yet and Tom Dowd wasn't there yet, and Gregg was in a working mode, he wanted to work. So, he said, you know, "Let's do something." I said, "Okay, what do you want to do?" He goes, "I wanna sing something." I said, "Okay, what do you wanna sing?" He says, "I don't know, pick something." So, I walked in the control room and I took out the tape box and I put up tape and scrolled it back and it was Midnight Rider that we were gonna work on, so Gregg goes out in the studio, puts his head down and sings Midnight Rider. And, at the end of the song he picks his head up he goes, "How was that?" And, I looked to my left, and I looked to my right and there was no one in the control room except me and I was pushing talkback button, I said, "Sounded great." That's the vocal, that's Midnight Rider, one take, nobody there, just Gregg. ♪Well, I've got to run ♪To keep from hidin' ♪And I'm bound ♪To keep on ridin' ♪And I've got one more ♪Silver dollar ♪But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no ♪Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider♪ That magic that he possessed should never go, you know, overlooked. He's just an incredible singer, an incredible talent, but happened to be blessed to have this magnificent brother's abilities so it was a balancing act. ("Midnight Rider" by The Allman Brothers Band) ♪and I don't own the clothes I'm wearin' ♪And the road goes on forever ♪And I've got one more silver dollar ♪But I'm not gonna let 'em catch, no ♪Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider♪ - Midnight Rider has sort of become synonymous with The Allman Brothers, hasn't it? Probably because, you know, the lyrics became true. "I've got to run to keep from hidin'" and "the road goes on forever," it certainly has. You know, it's a classic Southern Gothic song, it has all that darkness and intrigue and mystery. - It's probably Gregg's most well crafted song. And, it's got that Country feel underneath it, but it also has that swampy, ominous undertone. And, it just came to define the part of The Allman Brothers Band that's separate from the jams and, you know, that's a song and they've never really varied from the original arrangement, they don't add long solos. They're playing a song. - [Voiceover] As important as Criteria Studios was for the recording of the band's second album, it was also the location of an even more celebrated work featuring Duane Allman. Before the release of Idlewild South Eric Clapton had arrived with his new ensemble, Derek and the Dominos. A massive influence on Duane, particularly with his band Cream, whose elongated Blues based instrumental jams had prefigured the work of The Allman Brothers Band. Clapton was at the time desperate to back out of the spotlight. Tired of his guitar god status, he'd stolen his latest group from husband and wife band leaders Delaney and Bonnie. And, they had come to Miami to begin work with Tom Dowd on a record. Yet, by chance Duane became a key part of the proceedings. - The Allman Brothers were playing in Miami, playing a live show at the High Life (mumbles). When Tom Dowd told Eric Clapton that the Allmans were in town, or coming to town we were at the studio working on the Derek and the Dominos album. We left the studio to go see the show, and after the show we all caravaned back to the studio. - We had a show in Miami and Duane had spoken to Tom Dowd about, "Is there anyway I can meet Eric." And then, I think at the same time Eric was saying, "Oh, that's the guy that played Hey Jude "with Wilson Pickett, is there anyway we can get together?" So, we were playing at outdoor show there in North Miami and there was like a photographers pit in front of the stage and all of a sudden everybody looked down and there's Tom Dowd and Eric and Bobby Whitlock, and Duane actually stopped playing, you know. And, it was like, "Wow, they're here." And then afterwards, we went to Criteria. - Eric and Duane were so incredibly magically connected that there was no way to separate them. When they started playing together they weren't gonna stop, nothing was gonna stop them. - We actually left Duane there and went and played maybe three or four shows in the Midwest without him 'cause he said, you know, "I wanna do this, "I'll only miss one show." And then he called and said, "Well, I'm gonna miss "a couple more." So, we covered for him. He wasn't doing it as a career move, he was doing it because they hit a musical note together and a personal note. And, he was just proud to be a part of it. I'm sure he was hopeful of being introduced to a wider audience as well. - [Voiceover] Allman had joined the sessions early enough to make a real difference to the material. And, with Clapton looking to retreat from the kind of lead guitar virtuosity that had made him so famous he allowed Duane ample room to shine. - It was only a short period of time, I don't think we recorded more than maybe a week or ten days prior to The Allman Brothers' concert in Miami that was kind of the catalyst that put all that together. My recollection is that we recorded three songs for Derek and the Dominos without Duane, only three songs. So, Duane was a huge part of that record. It wasn't an after fact, although he wasn't part of the plan, it soon became that when Duane is now part of the band, or at least sitting in the studio with them. Everything was recorded live. So, they were very affected, they meaning the band, was very affected bu Duane's presence. The uniqueness of having two guitar players made that environment exciting for everyone. - [Duane] Eric Clapton man, let's talk about him. He's a gas, he's a real fine cat and I considered it a privilege, you know, and an honor to play on his Derek and Dominos album. - [Voiceover] He has nice things to say about you in the issue of Rolling Stone last year. - [Duane] Man, it just tickles me to death to hear him say anything about me ever, man. He wrote the book, man, you know? Just Contemporary White Blues Guitar, Volume One, you know. But, it's his style and his technique is what's really amazing. He's got a lot to say, too, but man, the way he says it it just knocks me out, man, it does so well, man. - Here you got Duane Allman who's respected and idolized by Eric Clapton. And, you've got Eric Clapton who's idolized and respected by Duane Allman. Duane's gonna make Eric more excited and better, bring out the best in Eric. Eric's gonna make Duane excited and bring out the best in Duane. You got Bobby Whitlock who's a phenomenal singer, making Eric vocally that much better, because they're excited about performing with each other. The success or the failure of the record is somewhat negligible at that point, nobody really cares. Everybody thinks when they're in the studio that they're making a hit. But, when you're making the performance in the studio, it isn't about selling records, it's about having a great opportunity to make this great performance. If it sells, it sells, if it doesn't it's still a great performance. ("Any Day" by Derek and the Dominos) - [Voiceover] Released in November 1970 despite a positive critical reception the album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs was not the instant hit that many predicted. Yet, it slowly grew in stature with its title track in particular becoming a Rock standard. And, over time the lyrical inspiration for the song and Duane Allman's prominent contribution to it became known. - Layla started out as a ballad. It was written for Pattie Harrison who was married to George Harrison. And, Clapton was madly in love with her. And, Layla was sort of his outpouring of love for Pattie. Duane heard it and thought they should speed it up and he's like, "What about this?" And, he played a little intro lick. It was based on Albert King's song, As the Years Go Passing By. ("As the Years Go Passing By" by Albert King) ♪There is nothing I can do ♪If you leave me here to cry ♪There is nothing I can do ♪If you leave me here to cry - That became Layla, that became one of the classic guitar intros to any rock song. ("Layla" by Derek and the Dominos) - The entrance of Duane into Clapton's world I think was huge. He'd already been opened up by Delaney Bramlett to American Roots music, but he hadn't, up to that point encountered a peer, someone who could duke it out with him, all night long. And, that record is just a sensational document of this summit meeting. ♪Layla ♪You've got me on my knees ♪Layla ♪I'm beggin' darlin' please ♪Layla ♪Darlin' won't you ease my worried mind♪ At that point Clapton was as inspired by the presence of this other extraordinarily talented guitar player as he was by any of the backstory that we know about Pattie Harrison. Yeah, that language feeds into the writing of songs and perhaps the vocals, but there's something else going on altogether on that record that's even more compelling, it's in a purely musical sense. ("Layla" by Derek and the Dominos) - Layla's a great record now, and without Duane Allman it simply would not be. The real reason the record is great is that there's two great guitar players there and you can hear them dueling and supporting each other. That's the fantastic thing about the record. And, it doesn't happen in The Allman Brothers Band because Betts isn't Clapton. It's very, very unusual. Has there ever been a record on which two guitar players of that magnitude duet? It's beloved and it deserves to be beloved, it's a monument. It's really a tremendous record. - [Voiceover] Returning to the band that bore his name after his brief stint with Clapton, Duane Allman was immediately thrown into an extensive tour. With Idlewild South released but under performing commercially, The Allman Brothers Band took to the road with an unforgiving schedule that saw them play dates across the country. - When you look at the Allmans as a unit, you know, and you remember how difficult it must have been even for them just to be transported from spot A to spot B, I mean, you know, two drummers, two guitar players, a bass player, a keyboard player, all that equipment, a B3, Leslies, you know, just going to a restaurant, everything becomes an issue because everybody can't fit into the car and go, "Let's run down the street." So, you know, nothing was easy for those guys. They worked hard and they deserved everything that they got. - The work ethic was very strong, I mean we literally went up and down the highway. I mean, going to New York was like going to the corner grocery to get a loaf of bread. We were ready to go, and we stayed out. I think we were on the road like in 1970 maybe counting the travel over 300 days out of 365. So, we stayed working. - [Voiceover] The constant touring did take its toll, however. Behind the scenes the band had gone from dabbling in hallucinogens to fully developed heroine addictions. With Duane himself almost fatally overdosing in October 1970. Yet, despite these struggles on stage he was winning over audiences across the country. And, in an age of rockstar excess was redefining the very idea of a guitar virtuoso. - Duane Allman was never a showman. That was of very little interest to him. He was about making music, and that was it. He used to talk about how, "We don't wear costumes and we don't wiggle "our asses on stage, we're not into any of that. "If you want to come hear us make music then come. "If you want the other stuff, don't come." ("In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" by The Allman Brothers Band) - I think Duane was the anti-guitar guy. It's almost as if it's a kind of an intimacy that the audience is allowed to particpate in rather than, you know, the other extreme, you know, Led Zepplin expansiveness, where it's the show, it's putting it out there. And, that's great, too. ("Bring It On Home" by Led Zepplin) ♪Try to tell you baby ♪What you tryin' to do ♪You're tryin' to love me baby ♪Love another man, too ♪Bring it on home ♪Sweetest little-- - But it's different, and there's more show in rock, or there was at that time, probably always will be, than there is this illumination of an artist in the process of making art. (rock music) Without being flashy he was mesmerizing. There was this look of ecstasy on his face when he was getting really into it that was palpable that he sort of became the only thing in the room. And, no amount of showmanship can really compare to, you know, to witnessing this moment of ecstasy on the part of an extraordinary virtuoso. - [Voiceover] And, it was this spontaneity and improvised fluidity that the group decided to capture on their next album. After the commercial disappointments of the first two LPs in March 1971 The Allman Brothers Band were recorded across two nights at Bill Graham's Fillmore East in New York. Upon its release the resultant double album finally achieved sales to match the band's critical acclaim and it broke into the U.S. top twenty. - I remember early on there was like a sales thermometer for the first album, you know a big guy. And, the mercury never (laughs) never got up, it was all still in the bottom. And, you know, we kept saying, "Wow." And then, you know, the second album, a little bit better, but again the faith and the wherewithal and the knowledge to go ahead and do that Fillmore album, that took a lot of insight on everybody's part. - It's quite frankly very unusual for a band of that statue, in terms of existence, they'd only done two albums, to do a live album at that point was somewhat interesting. I'm not sure that anyone would have looked back on it and said, "Okay, now's the time to drop a live album." 'Cause, quite frankly they didn't have that many songs yet. Again, a double album, you know, none of it made any sense, but it worked. ("Hot 'Lanta" by The Allman Brothers Band) - Neither the first album, nor the second album really got across what they're capable of live, which is these long improvisations, and you know, you have to remember the Grateful Dead was huge at this time, too. So, you had people wanting this live extended jams. It's not like it was in a vacuum or anything. You had a lot of hippies wanting to listen to these long extended jams. And, the Allman Brothers were great at that. Those first two albums did not get that across. So, I think it was hugely important for them to go ahead and get a live album out. And, of course, the Fillmore album became like one of the greatest live albums ever recorded. ("Hot 'Lanta" by The Allman Brothers Band) - No one had ever put out a double live album before. That was a gamble, that was almost wreckless. Two sides of the album each had one song. Who does that? But, you know, they all knew, Phil Walden that they came alive when they were on concert stage. And, the best way to turn people on to what the Allman Brothers were about was releasing a live album. It captured a brilliant Rock and Roll band on a very brilliant two night stand. I don't know if they ever sounded that good after that, but that night they soared. That's the album that turned it around for the Allman Brothers. It was their first top twenty album and it really set the stage for everything that came after. - [Voiceover] A decade after forming the Uniques back in Daytona Beach Duane Allman had finally reached a mass audience. While the Fillmore East album rose up the charts and pushed The Allman Brothers Band into the mainstream the group themselves continued with their relentless touring schedule. In August, 1971 Duane took a short break joining the band Cowboy who he introduced to Capricorn Records the year before in Muscle Shoals sound studios for sessions for their second LP. He also attended the funeral of King Curtis, the saxophone virtuoso who he had recorded with and befriended in Muscle Shoals. By September however, he was back in the studio with the band for the recording of a new album and with a hit record behind them things had changed. - After the success of the Fillmore East album for The Allmans the pressure was on. They were no longer a "Southern Band" or "Boogie Band" or whatever, they were now a top shelf act, hugely successful, having to go back to the studio and create another record. The pressure's on. - [Voiceover] This time the band split their recording duties with continued touring and despite being present for a number of the sessions Duane Allman would never complete his work on the new album. Having relentlessly pursued his singular musical vision for the best part of a decade through different projects, venues, and studios across America, his band was finally achieving recognition both in the U.S. and internationally. And, his guitar technique and his musical sensibility were continuing to develop. Yet, on October the 29th, 1971 a life of passion and inspiration came to a sudden end. - There had been a break in touring because the band members went into rehab to clean up the heroin use, and Duane had come out of that clean, as far as heroin, and in good spirits. Had been in New York, we were on just a little hiatus there, the band said, "Willie, you and your wife take a trip "to the Bahamas for a few days." Great. Got on the plane, checked in to the hotel right around dinner time. Seven o'clock got a call from Bunky Odom, one of the employees at Walden's management and said, "There's been a terrible accident with Duane "and we don't know the outcome now." - I was at the studio when I got the news and the news came in the way that was not, it wasn't a fatal accident at that point, they weren't sure. The information was sketchy. They weren't sure how serious of an accident it was, but we knew that there was an accident, a motorcycle accident. And we all just, you know, basically just held our breath and hoped for the best. - It was big Linda's birthday, she was Berry's wife. Duane was driving over to West Macon on his Harley Davidson Sportster, behind him was Candice Oakley, who was Berry's sister and Duane's girlfriend was in the car with her. Coming in the other direction was a flat bed construction truck and it had a crane on the back for lumber. Duane's driving, truck turns in front of him. No sweat, because by the time Duane gets there the truck's gonna be gone, except there was a big pot hole at the intersection. Truck stops, blocking Duane's path. By that time he'd either had to lay the bike down or hope he could somehow swing around it. There was a big iron ball on the bottom of the crane, apparently that hit either Duane or the motorcycle. Duane flies off the motorcycle, motorcycle flies up in the air and it slams into Duane, and he passed away just a few hours later. - Phil Walden and his wife had been in Bimini for a little vacation so he and I met at the Miami airport, flew back we were in Macon by midday on Saturday. And, of course, put the funeral plans in motion, but what a shock, what a shock. - [Voiceover] On November the 1st, 1971 Duane Allman was buried in Rose Hills Cemetery in Macon, so often the location of his group's night time diversions. Only 24 years old when he died the hole he left in The Allman Brothers Band was potentially unfillable. And, many speculated that without their leader the group wouldn't be able to continue. - It was like, "What are we gonna do now?" I think at the funeral when the band played I said, "We're gonna be all right." I mean, it's not gonna be the same but we're gonna go forward. My fear was gone at the funeral when they played, boy what a moving thing that was. And, pretty quickly they had to, we were, you know, back on the road. But, not with the idea we gotta go, you know, we gotta go grab the money. It was just like we gotta keep this thing going. - [Voiceover] In February, 1972 the final Allman Brothers Band album LP to feature its founding member was released, Eat a Peach. With Duane absent on only three tracks across the double album this collection of live and studio material provided listeners with some of the guitarists most impressive work and it became the band's first album to break the U.S. top ten. - Duane's death probably had some sort of effect on the success of Eat a Peach. There's always going to be that element that, you know, Jimi Hendrix is dead, let's run out and buy all his records, but at the same time that was an amazing, amazing work that they had put together. The thing that sold everybody on that record was Mountain Jam, because that was a monumental piece of work. It was quite a hell of a swan song for Duane. ("Mountain Jam" by The Allman Brothers Band) - Mountain Jam which goes on for what, 25, 30 minutes? Duane's solo in that is phenomenal. It's just like listening to Coltrane. It's like listening to Miles. He starts and ends up here and goes to a lot of interesting places in between. - [Voiceover] Although Duane's performances on the live recordings captured the best of improvisational techniques the album was perhaps most notable in that it contained his only original composition. The melody of the track Little Martha came to Duane in a dream in which it was played to him by the recently deceased Jimi Hendrix. And, the resultant guitar duet aptly brought Eat a Peach to a close. The name of it was sort of a bringing together two things in his life. At Rose Hills cemetary there's a statue of a little girl named Martha Ellis who died when she was around eleven, and everyone called her Little Martha, but also Duane's girlfriend, he nicknamed her Little Martha. That's the only song he's credited with writing. I mean, he helped with arangements, but that the only song he wrote. And, it's just a beautiful, sweet, loving song. ("Little Martha" by The Allman Brothers Band) - I think it's incredibly fortunate for the rest of those guys that Duane had cut Little Martha because its a poem. It's obviously rendered even more poignant by virtue of the reality, but it just a sublime little piece that not only shows his dextrousness, I mean everything he played did, but showed a gentle, really touching part of him that you don't get in the cranked up stuff. So, to be able to just open a curtain before you close it for the last time and have this revealed? That's a sensational moment, you know. ("Little Martha" by The Allman Brothers Band) - It's fitting that it closes the studio side of Eat a Peach. And, because it is just the perfect way of saying goodbye. - [Voiceover] The success of the album established the band as one of America's premier Rock acts. Through 1972 both the venues and the audiences increased and Dickie Betts in particular began to shine bother as a lead guitartist and song writer. Yet, behind the scenes the band members had in no way recovered from Duane's death. And without his leadership and passion they were lost. - To me that's, even though the money days and the record sales were gonna be astronomical from that point on you could almost feel that, you know, it's gonna be down hill. We're gonna go on, but there was no replacing Duane. he was a natural leader and nobody really blossomed. Nobody really blossomed. He was irreplacable, the band went on, the band was different, the music was different, but he was just irreplaceable and nobody could fill his shoes. So, that, again, even though there was much financial success after that it was basically downhill from there on. - [Voiceover] And, no one was going downhill faster than bassist Berry Oakley. Having been the reason for Duane's trip to Jacksonville that had resulted in the band forming in the first place Oakley was Allman's closest friend in the ensemble and after the guitarist's death he was thrown into a position of responsibility that he could never live up to. - The sad thing about Berry was that when he lost Duane he lost himself. A lot of things happened. He was pressured into, "Nobody else wants to lead this thing "and you were closest to him, so you be the leader. "You're the one that's been organizing stuff "at the big house and when we have the big dinners "and stuff that you, and when we wanna have jam sessions "you're the one that puts them all together. "You're the organized guy, you be in charge." And, it was something that he couldn't handle. And, the loss of Duane was something that he couldn't handle. And so, he began to do as you do alcohol and drugs began to take their toll on him to such an extent that that was one of those you could almost see in advance. - [Voiceover] Berry Oakley died on November the 11th, 1972. Killed in a motorcycle accident that occurred less than a mile fom the one that had taken Duane Allman just a year beforehand. Despite this second loss, again the band persevered. Yet, their musical vitality would begin to slowly diminish. But, in the wake of these two deaths an entire scene began to blossom both through groups signed to Phil Walden's Capricorn Records and acts emerging on other labels. The inspiration and the example set by The Allman Brother's Band, and in particular Duane Allman himself developed into a significant new musical movement, Southern Rock. - We're gonna try to play one as best as we can for Duane Allman and Berry Oakley from The Allman Brothers. They were free birds, people. (cheers) ("Free Bird" by Lynyrd Skynard) - Duane Allman was absolutely an essential in like setting that template for the Southern Rock guitarist. Everybody wanted to be like Duane Allman. Everybody who formed a band after that whether, you know, whether it was Charlie Daniels who'd been in music for a long time, but formed the Charlie Daniels Band, or the Marshall Tucker Band, or the guys in Lynard Skynard they all had guitarists that dueled with each other and that, you know, brought out the bottle neck every once in a while and jammed like the Allman Brothers, and specifically like Duane Allman. Ed King, the guitar player for Lynyrd Skynyrd, actually the only non southerner he was in a band called Strawberry Alarm Clock, a psychedelic Pop band in California. He saw Duane Allman play at the Roxy or the Whiskey and came to the South and decided I don't wanna be incense and peppermints anymore, I wanna be like Duane Allman. That's how massively important Duane Allman is, and he ended up writing the, you know, Sweet Home Alabama So, you know, yeah he was hugely important. ("Sweet Home Alabama" by Lynyrd Skynyrd) - [Voiceover] By the mid 1970s the movement was at its peak. With Macon successfully transformed into one of the most vital musical centers in America. The Allman Brothers Band and other acts became key supporters in former Georgian Governor Jimmy Carter's successful 1976 Presidential campaign. And, the South had finally re-emerged from its musical exile. - The Allman Brothers Band were the flagship of the Capricorn Records. They took off first and that's what Phil focused on. Duane was the first one, he latched onto Duane and Duane built it into what it is, the world is embracing what they're doing and with their success all the other bands started moving to town. And, you could come to Macon at one time just to hook up. The South had had so much negative press forever, since the Civil War, but here was something kind of positive that southern people embraced the kind of music we were putting out. And, again that was the word, it was positive, a positive face was on it. - [Voiceover] And although, this wave of activity died down by the 1980s as new movements and musical trends emerged. Duane Allman's achievements remain intact. He only left behind a relatively small number of recordings captured across a brief career, yet his position as one of the creative and genuinely original guitarists in rock continues to grow as he's rediscovered by new generations of listeners. - A lot of people who never heard him play have gone back and listened and they say, "Wow." You know, I mean you hear people that maybe were just barely born at the time, but now that they've heard his music they recognize what a musical genius he was. And, he is getting his recognition now. - Let's face the facts, Duane was 24 years old when he died. He had an effective career of 3, 4, 5 years. He'd only played the guitar for maybe 10 years. He'd only picked up the slide guitar last three years of his life. And, despite all that look at his body of work. Does he belong in the same breath as Hendrix, and Clapton, and Jimmy Page? Hell yeah. I'd be willing to argue with anyone, Duane Allman's the greatest guitar player that ever lived. (slow rock music)
