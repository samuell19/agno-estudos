Fen. Thank you. Enough. Speak Mandarin when you see Daddy. Ann, what about you? Up until Feb 10, atypical pneumonia has been spreading around Guangzhou. Many healthcare workers have been infected. Officials are investigating the cause of this new disease. Experts have been sent to Guangzhou to search for a cause of the disease. Daddy! You've grown taller! So much in just a year. Mom. Probably around 8 a.m. What's wrong? She's missing her friend Jessie. She cried her eyes out before she left. You'll make new friends soon. I don't need to. We'll be back in LA this summer anyways. I promised to go to horse camp with her. Why isn't it turning on? - Look! Snowflakes! - What? Why is there mold everywhere? I just got back from China too. Let's fix it when it's not as humid. Ann, go wash your hands. It's really late. Go to bed. Don't make me say it again. Why is the luggage still outside? How do you like your new uniform? It's the best school in the area! I didn't know how tall you were. Let Mom buy it for you on Monday. Alright, enough. I told you girls to speak Mandarin! Go brush your teeth. Mom? Can I not cut my hair short? It's not up to me. I can't change the school rules. Hey. Why don't you go shower? Are you doing alright? Would it matter if I wasn't? How could you live like this? Live like what? What's wrong with this? I'm gonna go shower. CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET DIALING 8471820 No. 36, Bingzhong Wu. Excuse me. Don't you have a meeting? I called. Don't blame me if you get fired. It's not that serious. Ms. Lily Wang? Is Ms. Wang here? Wait here. It was only 2 cm back in America. It appears to have grown slightly. But don't worry, you have me! Has it spread at all? Not sure yet. But I recommend surgery immediately. Immediately? Can't we wait until the girls have adjusted to their new schools? They're kids! They'll adjust fine. This thing can't wait. What thing? Cancer? Breast cancer? It's cancer. That's why it can't wait. Huay's not wrong. Fen and Ann are big girls now. You must take care of your health first. The lymph node needs to be removed too. In two weeks' time? Whose pretty daughter is this! Okay, now! Hair is not a matter of life and death. It'll grow back in no time. Look at mine. It'll never grow back. My life is perfectly fine without it. Come on, I'll walk you in. No need. You're just like your mom. Good morning. - Dad? - What's wrong? Is Mom going to be okay? The fortune teller said she'd outlive me. She'll be fine. The fortune teller also said you'd have two sons. Having two daughters is difficult enough, let alone two sons. Alright! Stop worrying. Here… This money is… For books. Buy your classmates some snacks too. Fen Liang! Love the haircut! Your dad said you were top of your class in America. That's why you can join mid-semester. Your parent-teacher contact book. All your test results will be in here. Your parents will have to sign each time. Both hands. Here. I'll lend you my book for now. We have dictation every day at 7:30 a.m. Don't be late. That's all. In order to emphasize Mulan's yearning for home, the same sentence is repeated twice. What do we call this figurative language? We went over this last class. Repetition! And what do we call this? Parallelism! Remember parallelism and repetition! It will definitely be on your exam! Any questions? Anyone have a question? Always radio silence… And always wrong answers on the tests. Let's move on to the next stanza. THE BALLAD OF MULAN Thank you. Junior high students whose clothing and appearance are marked should go to Office Of Student Affairs to find an instructor to report to. Fen Liang. You don't remember me? - Lin… - Ting. Class 2, 1st grade! I used to live next door. - Thanks for the notebook. - You're welcome. Didn't you move to the States? When did you get back? Oh… my mom wanted to come back. How long have you had these? I want them too. Wow! You've really become an American! No caretaker will be as thoughtful, Sis. No need. Just a few days will do. Okay, Sis. I have to go. Talk later. You're up? Dr. Han said the surgery was successful. Water? - Was that your sister? - Yeah. I bought your favorite vermicelli. Sorry. Here. Has she borrowed money from you lately? No. Stop worrying about these things. That's good. I was thinking. We've had the place for over ten years. Shouldn't we fix it up? - Alright, here. - Wait. Let me finish. Property prices have dropped lately. Can we buy…? It could drop to rock bottom and we still can't afford it. So what if it drops? The girls are getting older. We can't keep living like this. With the current economy, we're lucky we have a place to live. Dinner's ready! Girls, clear the table. Let's eat. Smells delicious! Look! Egg fried rice with ketchup! Done! Come on. Mommy will be back in a few days! How is that tasty? It's not nutritious. Here! Eat this! Ann Liang. Are you going to eat the rice? I'm asking one last time. Are you going to eat it? That's it, then. Don't eat at all. - Daddy? - What? Can I have a bike? - Then I want one too. - All you two do is ask for stuff. You're not little girls anymore! We just went over this yesterday! How much longer is it going to take? Why don't you take up the whole class? The exam is tomorrow! You better be more prepared than this. Pay attention! We're not done yet. Did I say class is over? What are you all looking at? Continue! The answer is two? Oh, dear! How's school? Daddy said Yu Lin's your classmate? It's Ting Lin. Isn't that nice? How's that nice? You're not the one being mocked "American." Softly. Mommy? Is it not nice to live with Daddy? Families are meant to be together. Then why take us to America in the first place? True… If I knew this was going to happen, I wouldn't have. Doesn't matter now. Mommy may not live much longer anyways. God bless our food. In Jesus' name, Amen. Let's eat. Thirty-eight million NTD for an apartment! Crazy. - Fen, give me your bowl. - I'm not hungry. Huay, please deal with the birds upstairs. It smells awful. Relax, it's just a couple of birds. Dad. Why does the internet never connect? Old buildings are all like this. You need to be patient. Don't make a face. I want to go back to America. Ann keeps squishing me at night. I can't sleep at all. I grew up sleeping in the same bed as my five siblings. We basically all shared a pair of pants! How do you wear the same pair of pants? Eat your food, Ann. This is not America. We can't have separate rooms each. - Speak Mandarin! - I never agreed to come back! - You think I got sick on purpose? - Enough! Can we not talk about this right now? Eat your food! Here. What will happen after I die? Who is going to take care of Ann? You keep spoiling Fen like this. How is she ever going to grow up? - You're not going to die! - I won't be by your side! It's bad of you to spoil her like this! They're still so young. Can you not talk about this every day? I'm not giving up yet. Why are you? - What's your name? - Lily Wang. May I see your name tag? We're doing chemotherapy today. Can you unbutton your shirt please? Okay. I'm going to sterilize first. Please relax. - Just a bit more tape. - Okay. Please relax. WHEN SOMEONE YOU LOVE HAS CANCER Come in. - What? - Please sign off last month's salary. So soon? It's the 5th already! Over 500,000 NTD? Did we pay this much in previous months? It's already less than last month. Are you leaving for Shenzhen next month? Mr. Lee told you, didn't he? Big mouth. I haven't agreed yet. He knows about my wife's current... Alright, that's between you two. Thank you. Stop forcing it! You'll break the club. Take a break. That's enough practice for today. Damn it, you're so noisy! Don't make that face. Come on, I've got something to show you. - Check this out. - Wow. Listen to me. You'll be rich with this in your home. Forget it. Lily is Christian. This will upset her. Please! Don't you know that Buddha and Jesus are buddies? It'll be fine! Better yet, why don't you pay back the money you owe me? Bro, I'm not trying to cancel the debts. - This one really is special. Try me. - No way. How often have I bought these from you? Jin Chan, Pixiu, all "bring luck and fortune," it's bullshit! Completely useless! Fuck! You have no taste. Who's taking out the trash? I did it yesterday. - Ann, don't play dead! - You're the one playing dead! Ann Liang, I've told you many times. Don't cut your nails on the toilet. It's Fen Liang! Not Ann Liang! Fen Liang, help me move this Guanyin. Ann, go take out the trash. - I'd rather take out the trash. - What? - I wonder what got into you today… - Weirdo. Daddy! - Is this mine? - Do you like it? Try it. Be careful. Where are you going? This way. Come back. What's taking your sister so long? How about I let you eat some Cheerios? Isn't he handsome? This one's even better! I remember having both these cards. You've bought this one. I think it's that one. Look at the girl with the hair clip. If you tell her Tony Sun is going bald, she'll burst into tears! It looks like he dyed his hair. - He looks even more handsome. - Yes. Hey! Tony Sun is going… You're gonna get me in trouble! I'm so jealous of your native English. Oh, come on. My English sucked when I arrived in America. Mom forced me to study 20 words a day. At least your mom studied English. My mom still pronounces "A-B-Shee." It's so embarrassing. At least your mom isn't sick. It's not her fault that she's sick. I know. But she can control her temper. She may also want to go back to America. She just doesn't say it. Come here. What is it? - Why are you opening an old issue? - It's fine. Is this what you read in America? Who's this? You don't know who this is? Wow, you really like horses! Your room is filled with them! Is this your horse? It's my neighbor's. His name is Splash. As in water splash. Splash. What does riding a horse feel like? - Why do you want to know? - Just curious. It's as if… the whole world stops. And nothing else matters. - As if you're a Minotaur? - Whatever. I've never seen anyone ride. Show me! You crazy? Taiwan doesn't have horses. Let's search the internet and find out! The internet here never works! We can search during computer class. - It's probably really far away. - Dummy, we can take a bus! - Who are you calling dummy? - You! Must be my sister again. What is it? You always forget your keys. Figure it out yourself. Are you sure you want to lock her out? She'll never learn otherwise. Well, it's time for me to leave anyway. - This early? - Yeah, it's about time. - Just stay a little longer. - I can't. My mom thinks I'm at cram school. I better get home before she does. See you at school. Bye bye. Ann Liang! Not again. Didn't you hear the buzzer? Where's your sister? How would I know? Mommy! Sis won't let me in. She forgot her keys. So she hung out on the rooftop with me. Okay, sorry for the trouble. Thank you. Ann, don't go upstairs by yourself. - Do you hear me? - But… Go to your room. How could you lock your sister out? She always forgets her keys. What if something bad happened to her? You are driving me crazy! Did I send you to America so you can talk to your mother this way? Who left the gate open again? I've told you so many times. Fen locked Ann out. And said she didn't know where she was. Fen Liang, what are you doing? Come out! Where are the eggs? I forgot. Can't do anything right. Don't talk like that! It's just eggs, okay? - Fine. I'll go buy them. - I'll go buy them. - Save it. - I don't want to be called useless. Save it. Sis. Look who's speaking English. Aren't you American, Ann? Why are you even at English cram school? None of your business, loser! I'll say whatever I want to say. Stupid kids. Close your presentation by clicking the upper right corner. The teacher isn't looking. Search it now! The first one! The first horse ranch! - It really exists. - See, there really are horses in Taiwan. Let me copy this address. Okay, now. Let's… - Hurry! - Please don't come over. Okay, done. Hey. Why don't I take the girls to the zoo this weekend? You can get some rest at home. They don't like the zoo anymore. What's wrong? Nothing. When is your next chemo session? Why? Are you going to China again? Even if we sold the house in America, we won't have much left after paying off the loans. I still have to go over there. Also, like everyone's been saying, with the current economy, staying here is like waiting for death. You're right. Staying here is waiting for death. Nothing I say is ever right. - Can't someone else go instead? - That's not the point. You want me to buy a bigger apartment. But you won't let me leave for work. What do you want me to do? Rob a bank? So I want the apartment for myself, huh? Am I that selfish in your eyes? I should've listened to you back then and stayed in Taiwan. Why go to America? I wouldn't say that. Who wasn't figuring it out as they went along? When I first felt the lump, I kept thinking… It's all over now. All these years of hard work and now I'm back to square one. After I had the surgery, Huay made Ann fried rice with ketchup. What? Ann hates ketchup. He doesn't know? What would happen if I wasn't around? DO BETTER NEXT TIME! PARENT-TEACHER CONTACT BOOK PARENT'S SIGNATURE The juice is ready. Drink up. Ann. This is plural. It should be "there are," not "there is." Ask your sister if you have questions. I can't even finish my own homework! Come on, drink it now. Otherwise, it'll oxidize. Don't blame me if you get cancer when you're older. You… Your Majesty, I'm begging you. Your mom is sick now. Can't you behave yourself? Dad, what did you see in Mom back then? I don't know, maybe I owed her in our previous lives. Then she must have taken a usury from you. Who taught you usury? Your Mandarin has improved. Dad. How do you whistle the way that you do? - What whistle? - This. Dad! - Sorry. - So annoying. Stop looking. Let's pick this one. This one is good. I hope it's on sale. This should last you until high school. I never said I'd go to high school here. Dad. Let me go back to America by myself. I can stay with Jessie. No way. Have you even asked Jessie about it? Your grades are terrible. When you're in the top ten of the class, we can talk about America. But I got straight A's in America. Let me tell you something. Before your mom got sick, she liked America even more than you do. She kept saying how great America was. Why didn't we have the treatment there? You really think I'm an ATM machine? My classmates used to chant, "Come to National Taiwan University, and to America we go!" Who didn't once have an American Dream? Then send me back! Those were the old days. Now we're planning to sell our apartment and get a bigger one. So that you girls can stop complaining about how crowded the space is. You two are like a broken record. Hey, hold your horses. Don't look at that. Mom said to buy a writing desk. Don't get me in trouble. Dad. If Mommy hadn't gotten sick, would we have stayed in America forever? Maybe. Then you'd be working here all alone? - Isn't that really sad? - It's alright. I'm not interested in being an American, eating burgers all the time. Becoming super fat… Then how were you so sure that Ann and I wanted to be Americans? Leave it against the wall, thank you. Didn't we agree to buy a writing desk? She can use that as a writing desk. Can you step aside? Her grades are terrible, and yet you buy her a dressing table! You think we're rich? Well, you clearly know we're not. Yet you still got her braces. It was my choice! It has nothing to do with Daddy. Don't interrupt when the adults are talking. Enough. How dare you slam the door! All you learned in America is slamming doors! I always knew how to slam doors. Shut up, Fen! You think I love serving you three? Without you three, I can go wherever I want! What are you saying? If you want to go to China, then go! What does that have to do with this? From now on I'll go wherever I want! Yu-Hsuan Chen. 59 out of 100. So many careless mistakes! Double-check your answers! Fen Liang. 52 out of 100. Yunzhi Jiang. 58 out of 100. Go back. Look at all your terrible grades! Which high school will accept you girls? Those who didn't pass, stand up! Stand up! Fen Liang! Does 52 count as a pass in America? Stand up! Does it? Get up here. Why didn't you stand up the first time? Walk faster! Two hits for every point below 60. Your hands. Both hands. Higher! How dare you? You got the worst score of the class! It's not like I didn't study! You got these grades when you studied? I wonder what happens when you don't! How dare you talk back? Extend your hands! Don't you dare cry. Get better grades next time! Crying is useless! Hold them up. Hold still. Can't you understand Mandarin? - Why are you so late? - Stop that, let's go. Looking for someone? Do you need a computer? How many hours? 50 NTD. Use the one in the back. HORSE CAMP HANNOVER'S EQUESTRIAN CLUB MEMBER APPLICATION CONSENT FORM CREATE AN ACCOUNT ACCOUNT Sis. Sis. Hello, parents. Our meeting is about to start. Please have a seat. First of all, thank you all for coming. I know you're all very busy. Today we will cover a few topics. First, a sensitive subject lately… Corporal punishment. Regarding this issue, the school has... Ms. Su. Just hit them if you need to. - Or they won't learn from their mistakes. - That's right! Right? Didn't we all grow up that way? Exactly! Why don't we discuss this topic later? Along with other class affairs. Let's talk about summer readings… Excuse me, are you Fen's mom? - Yes, I am. - I am Ting's mom. Thank you for letting Ting... Actually, I'd like them to stop being friends. Why is that? Ever since they became friends, my daughter's grades have dropped. She's always home late, as if she's turned into someone else. I'm not the only one who feels this way. Some parents even saw your daughter go to an internet cafe. So, what you're saying is… My daughter is a bad influence. Is that right? Excuse me, who else here doesn't want my daughter Fen hanging out with their daughter? - Mrs. Liang. - Nobody likes to be bottom of the class. Is she a bad kid because of poor grades? Mrs. Liang, if there's a problem... If girls only befriend my daughter when she gets good grades, I'd rather they not be her friends. PARENT SYMPOSIUM Let's get on with the letter of notice. NEW BLOG POST We're not sick! We have families! SARS is so serious. Did you eat dinner yet? I'm talking to you. You think this is a hotel? Take out your lunch box. - Where were you? - Nowhere. - You smell like cigarettes. - What? Liar. You went to an internet cafe, right? You followed me? Follow you? You think I have your "American" time? Fen Liang! Will you hurry up? Your temperature is still missing from this morning. You're always last. So slow. I've got things to do. Test scores are out! Wow, somebody got a lower math score than Fen Liang! - You're so mean. - How's your grade? I got 25th place. Ting, you're so good at it! You're in third place! My geography sucks too. You still got a better grade. - You've got 89. - Yours is pretty good as well. Another teacher showed me your blog. You must have lots to say to your mom. This year's speech contest is about the most influential person in one's life. I want you to prepare for it. But I don't know what to say. Sometimes love and hate are two sides of the same coin. Consider inviting your mom to attend. Fold the paper money, like this. So that your grandparents can get it. Is it enough for them to buy a new home? I think so. After Mommy is baptized, I can't burn money for them anymore. Won't they become really poor then? Come here, Ann. Give me a hug. Come here. Welcome, this way please. Okay. Of course. - Hi. How many of you are dining here? - Just us three. Can I get you some food, or would you like our ice cream special? Would you like some recommendations? We're good for now. Thank you. Alright, let me bring you some water. Order whatever you like. You were very little then, about four or so. - Here come your ice creams. - Wow. That's mine. Thank you. - The banana split is Fen's, right? - Okay. Can you even finish this? Not right now, I look so ugly. - No, you look pretty. - Stop. Me! Take one of me! Got it. We can come again. Ann, stop playing with the mask! You can't buy them even if you're rich. - Come on! - I'm back. You lost weight. Have you been pissing Mom off? - No. - No? - Really? - No. That's a lot of grey hair. I've been slaving away for you all! Alright, I'm going to let go. I'll take that. Wait! Don't come in yet. I need to sanitize everything. Aren't you overreacting? - Is this alcohol? - It's necessary. Leave your clothes here. I'll wash them tonight. - Oh. - I bought you some organic hair dye. - It won't hurt your scalp. - I want to dye Daddy's hair! Me too! My cookies! What are you giggling about? - Have you both grown taller? - I have! Let me double check. You have! Get down, let me get you. I'll have Mom bake you into cookies. I want to do it too. Does it look good? Looks great! You look so handsome. Ann, pass me the mirror. Ann mixed the dye all by herself. - Really? - I didn't help her at all. That's very impressive. - Let me see. - It's gross. Damn it, why is it the color of poo? I look like I fell into the toilet. Is this right? Will the color stay after I wash it off? Yeah. - This is the final color? - You're going to look handsome. How can I go to work with this hair? Come here, let Daddy dye your hair. Let Daddy dye your hair. PALLIATIVE CARE FOR FINAL STAGES What are you looking for? - Cotton swabs. - It's your ears again? Yup. I'm telling you. Don't fly so often. - That's not up to me. - Here you go. What are you doing this Sunday? Nothing. Come to church with me then? Forget it. I'll doze off before the singing's over. Can't you do it for me? Fine. If anything bad happens, at least in Heaven... Nothing's going to happen to you. Can't you be more optimistic? - Alright? - Even if I'm cured this time… It can still recur. A cancer recurrence doesn't happen that easily. I'm going for a smoke. If I'm gone, pay more attention to Ann. As for Fen, if she still likes America… - Try to send her back. - Can we not talk about this now? You think I'm not scared? Let me go have a smoke! Promise me! Everything was going so well today! Why must you bring all this up now? Can't we just spend one happy day together? All you ever talk about is your death! Breaking news. Today, a suspected SARS patient admitted to the Heping Hospital three days ago, took his own life while in quarantine. Mom prepared this mask for you. - She didn't mean it. - Yes, she did. Dad, do you remember what you said in the furniture store? What? I won't be in top ten of the class. But if I win the speech contest, you have to send me back to America. Ting, can I ask you a question? Are you still friends with that American? Why do you ask? I think you guys probably had a fight. Don't you think that Ms. Su asking her to be in the speech contest is super unfair? Her Mandarin is terrible. It's impossible for her to win. What a waste! What did she do to you? I didn't say anything wrong! Why are you so mad? In this world, the last person I want to be is my mom. For her fear will become my fear. For her… Weakness. Her weakness will become my weakness. Are you sure you want to write like this? - What? - Give it back to me. Why are you so mad at your mom? I just think she can do better. But… What if this is her best? Hey, Fen! Suit, polo shirt, shirt… Overreacting. Dad. Can you sign this for me? How's your speech going? Can't even talk about this? Fen, do you have a fever? - No. - Let me see. What do we do? Ann's had a fever for three days. Can you take her to the hospital? Calm down. Perhaps it's just a cold. - Take the mask with you! - Where are my other socks? I threw them away. They had holes. I could've still worn them. I still think she needs to see a doctor. - Give her some antipyretics first. - I did. With SARS going on hospitals are a mess. It's the worst time to go. You're not worried at all. Why do I even bother? You get mad at everything. Mom, the mask makes me feel uncomfortable. Don't remove it. We're almost there, okay? I want to go home. I know. We'll go home after we see the doctor. We're not there yet. The hospital is right ahead. Just walk over there. Can't you see she's ill? How is she supposed to walk there? She's even coughing… Alright, fine. Just my luck. Please fill in the form and get your temperature recorded. Then please move forward. Please move forward after filling it in and get your temperature recorded. Fill in the form here and get your temperature recorded. - Okay, thank you. - Please line up. What's your name? Mommy's here. Don't worry, okay? Please move forward and get your temperature checked. Thank you. - What's your name? - Ann Liang. Please open your mouth. - Ah. - This way. We're good for now. Okay. Please come over here after the temperature check. We can do the swab test over here. - Sit here. - Here. Please sit. Can you take off her mask for a second? Let's take this off. - Sweetie, we'll do a short test. - They need to do a saliva test. Please open your mouth. It'll be over soon. You're so brave. We're good for now. Okay, thank you. Let's go. - Don't forget your health insurance card. - Thank you. Please wait over there. Where are you taking me? Miss, you need to be quarantined for 15 days. Quarantine? Why do I need to be quarantined? I'm going home! Miss, please cooperate. We need to ensure everyone's safety. Why do I need to be quarantined? I don't have SARS! Please calm down. - What for! - We will contact your family for you. You'll be in trouble if you're wrong! Are you Ann Liang's mother? - Yes. - Ann has symptoms of pneumonia. She needs to be quarantined. Ann, listen. You need to be quarantined. I will pick you up later, okay? Sweetie, it's going to be fine. We just need to go inside. Let me call Daddy and pick you up later. I know. Okay, I know. I'll call Daddy and I'll come back. Your mom is right behind you. Unbelievable. What timing! Hello? Why are you in a rush? Did you forget that I'm leaving today? What do you mean "quarantine"? I told you not to go to the hospital! I'll stay with Ann in the hospital. Come back. You can't be there. Then what do you want me to do? No! You're too weak to be at the hospital. I'll call my sister. Did you hear me? I said come back. What's wrong with her now? Is your mom coming tomorrow? Yes… Remember, speak from your heart. Ms. Su. Can my mom not come tomorrow? Why? I doubt she wants to hear these words. Does she really not want to hear them? Or you just don't want to say them? Well written. Think about it. You're back? Mom, why is Daddy's luggage still here? Didn't Daddy leave for China? Daddy didn't go. Ann is quarantined at the hospital. You need to quarantine at home as well. But Daddy said not to go to the hospital! Daddy… Why do you never listen to me? - What's your teacher's number? - I have a speech contest tomorrow. - I have to go. - All you think about is yourself! What's her number? What do you know about my life? - Give it back! - You wanted me to study hard and I did! What more do you want? When have you ever cared about what I want? All you say is that I caused you cancer! Had I not stayed in the States for you, I wouldn't have had cancer! All you think about is yourself! That's what you do all day! How dare you hit me! Hit me again! I dare you to! Shut up! What are you doing? Let go! What are you two doing? What's going on? - I don't want to live! Just kill me! - She's just a kid. Don't talk like that! If you want to die, just die! You don't want to live anyways! - Fen! What did you say? - Am I wrong? How dare you tell your mom to die! What is this attitude? Come here! Come here! What did you say? Come out! - How dare you talk to your mom that way? - Stop! Please! How dare you? Is that how you talk to your mom? Is it? Let me see. Mommy's sorry. Mommy's sorry. Maybe she's home already. - Call me back if you hear anything. - Wait! That's my dad. Sir! Fen Liang. Are you her father? - Yes. - ID please. Huay Liang. Here you go. Thank you. Sorry for the trouble, officer. Hello? Yes. Okay, thank you. It's the comic book store. The comic books Ann rented are past due. Fen, go return them for your sister. - But shouldn't we be staying at home? - Just listen to your daddy. It's fine. Go return them after you're done eating. CHILD'S TOY Dad. I read your speech. If you still prefer to be in America, I'll do whatever it takes to send you back. But if you're just avoiding your problems, then it makes no difference where you go. I'll get it! Hello? Okay. Is that Ann? I want to talk to her! Sister-in-law, thank you! What did she say? She said Ann's going to be okay. It was just pneumonia. - She can leave this afternoon. - I'll go pick her up. She must be starving. What should I cook? Mommy. Can you clean my ears for me? Of course. Mommy. Remember we once talked about what animal we'd like to be in our next life? You said you'd like to be a horse. Do you remember your answer? No, I don't. You said you'd like to be a boy. Do you still think this isn't home? Mommy… Can you please not die? You know how much I love you, right? So, so much. Ann Liang! Sis!
