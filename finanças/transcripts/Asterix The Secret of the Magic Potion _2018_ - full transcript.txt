Panoramix? Everything good? -It could not be better. Panoramix? Everything good? -It could not be better. Why are you lying here on the floor? -I'm meditating. You are not out yet fallen a tree? Fallen from a tree. Asterix. Come on, Obelix, we help the druid rise. Help get up? Hey guys, leave me alone. I'm big enough to ... Children, calm down. Today, lesson number one: how do we make a drink that stinks? Can I taste? -No, Obelix. You know best ... that you are in the boiler when you were little. Children. Children, Panoramix will no teaching today. What is it? -A. .. Light meal. Light meal. -I'm not hungry. Say, Panoramix, this is ridiculous. If you have fallen ... just say that. - Druids don't fall from trees, Asterix. That is an earth ground. Don't fall from trees. And what about stumbling? That's a bad sign. How is he now? Did you fix it again? All those years no scratch. I have never sprained my ankle. Not once. And then suddenly: crack. All those years high in the trees. So much power. So much energy. But you keep that broken foot there not like climbing again? At Toutatis. Is it you? Do you invite me ... to Avalondegem, where the apples grow all year round? They are talking about apples. -Apples? What are you talking about? I understood the word apples. Why let's leave who deaf always listen? He leaves us no choice. - Have you heard the deaf? Everyone has a dip sometimes. Panoramix, be reasonable. We don't know you that way. You're right. I can't let myself be known. That's how I like to hear it. Our druid is old again. I take matters into my own hands. -Good. As long as I'm a druid from the village, I have to I take my responsibility. Exactly, well. A man goes difficult decisions. Absolutely. I don't know where he is left, but bravo. I can't be the only one anymore who knows the formula of the potion. Bravo. -What? I am looking for a young successor to whom I can entrust it. What? -From our young Gaulish druids ... I choose one to whom I will learn the recipe ... and the new druid from the village. Come on, let's go ... We are not going to look for a new druid. - Only because of a fall from a tree? I will fall from a tree someday. Panoramix, is this a joke? -There is no other way. They are talking about a recipe. -A recipe? A recipe with apples? An apple pie? -Be silent. Did you say a recipe now? -Yes, I said recipe. Why do they secretly bake apple pie? Did you really understand? Are you really not deaf? I don't beat women. And certainly not women of the deaf. Perfect. And you all stay close together, promised? And just be careful. Obelix, my cairn. - Excuse me, Panoramix. I walked behind those ... -Not those wild boars, Obelix. No? - My cairn. Isn't a menhir much stronger? What a disaster, Obelix. Entrust the potion to a young, inexperienced druid. Who says he will use it well? If he spreads the formula, that's it end of the invincible Gauls. The end of the invincible Gauls. Those guys you see playing there, those are Gauls. We offer resistance to the overpowers, right? And like their children Gauls want to be ... they must also be able to defend themselves. You are absolutely right, Asterix. My plan is risky. That is why the best warrior must be from the village. 0m help me so I don't have the wrong young, inexperienced druid molar. Two know more than one. -I have a question. Like another druid make the potion… I would finally can you also taste it? Take me back to my cabin, Obelix. Potion. What are you doing here? comrades? Wait, wait. Excuse me, but wild boar is not what it was. I understand it up to Panoramix, but then I lost it. Say it more clearly. Panoramix, venerable druid, the villagers and I ... give you this message as support and encouragement. You have a difficult decision taken and we stand behind you. Fact is ... -We have no choice. You have not asked us for advice, but that didn't matter. We are of course behind you. - Druid, I have a question. We might run less risk ... if you would like someone from the village learn to make the potion? A potion is only passing from druid to druid, Kostunrix. Would you trust your fish stall ... to a layman? -Absolutely not. A fish shop is much too technical. That requires precision, experience ... not only love for the profession ... but also interest in the latest developments. Always focused on the future. Just sayin… Panoramix? Panoramix? Do we really not have to come along? -Absolutely. With your broken foot ... -It is forbidden. Druids take the rules seriously. -Do you only wander? Isn't that a problem? -I have no choice. I have to go alone. Yes, we have a problem. -Being quiet. Panoramix. I should not have hid myself, but fell asleep. Before you get angry, take a look at my model. Pectin, what are you doing here? We are too far from the village to bring you back. They are definitely looking for you. I told everyone that she went. What? Did you know she was in the boiler? I have seen her crawl into it. -What? Why didn't you say anything, owl chick? -Because she asked. What did you say to the village? -Pectin is in the boiler. Awesome. What now? The forest is forbidden for women. I thought for non-druids. -And for women. Is it my fault that the druids prohibit everything? I may not have a potion, but do I make a point of that? You take a little girl with you without informing me. Tell me ... why Mr. Asterix always need to be aware of everything? Pectin. Pectin, come on, you don't have to cry like you have made such a beautiful model. Explain to me how it all works. Can I really come here? - Rather a child than Asterix and Obelix. But just try yourself hide long hair and voice. Do I have to hide that I am a girl? - A boy can come here. And what if they ask me a question? -Then you answer ... Exactly. Watch out, we're here. Is it normal that nobody is here? Druid? No, something is wrong. Do you realize, Obelix? The Great Council of Druids. The best druids of Gaul together. What a spectacle. A spectacle? - Pointing with their white beards. Scholars, philosophers that must be very impressive. Welcome to Panoramix, old man. -How is it with our star? The apple does not fall far from the tree. See what we have made for you. You can hang this in your forest. Be careful. Falling druids. Wait, Vitrokeramix. Did you not receive my message? I sent wild boar. -They said you fell. Cases? Is that all? -How so? Is that not enough? -And the transfer? The successor? Which transfer? Which successor? What are you cooking up, old buddy? Explain. Well, we didn't see that coming. Do you mean that, Panoramix? What if the potion falls into the wrong hands? You understand I don't make this decision have taken light, Fantasmagorix. Now I understand why you summoned the Grand Council. I thought it was strange that you called us together to tell you that you had fallen. I need you for the preselection of my candidates. Do you know the list of names of all? memorize young Gallic druids? By heart… We have a database. Database? Small tokens. Classified by level. Can druids write then? No, that's forbidden. "From mouth to ear, from druid to druid." Panoramix has taught you well. That is very good. No writings with the druids. Everything by heart. With all those formulas that we need Remember, our mind is full of stuff. The list of young, Gallic druids is on small tokens. Ignorance is bliss. -In a tray. Speech is silver, silence is golden. Jack cracked, shut up. - Go get it, men. Well, you fall from trees, we make chips. What do you not understand, Obelix? Do they all have a white beard? -All of them… I think so. - And how do they do that? Obelix, when I say they all have a white beard ... then each of them has one, they don't share the same beard. They all have a white beard. Not one white beard for everyone. Those are the very bad ones. Here the prutsers who can still do something. There the good one and there the very good one. You don't have much work on the very good ones. These are the greatest idiots. They can't even make onion soup. Everyone deserves a chance, But don't you just want the very good ones? No one is there with that one can replace druid like you. Nobody is irreplaceable. -I don't agree with that at all. Sulfurix? How are the men? with beards? Ages ago. Someone already has a potion invented against rheumatism? Sulfurix. How dare you appear at the Sacred Open Place, after all this time? After all this time you are maybe a bit smoother. Smoother? -Not physically. You still strain your laughing muscles. Nobody offers me to wear a cone? How dare you forbidden magic to use here? You know, that only works with sensitive spirits. What have you got against us? - Against you? Nothing. I am coming to present myself as a successor. -Successor? Successor to what? From the great Panorama mix of course. You? What a joke. - You can't even be a druid anymore. Do you think Panoramix is ​​you give the formula? Well then, comrade, do we fall from trees? Are we an apricot? You finally understood that you are not that special ... and that you have to pass on the torch. -Panoramix is ​​the best. Yours, yes. But everyone said that I was better than him. Have you forgotten that? If I had the potion ... I wouldn't just be a village protect mustache idiots. If we spread that magic power all over occupied Gaul ... we can overthrow Rome and put an end to war. But the famous Panoramix chooses a good student ... that he can mold to his image ... to make it selfish, like him. Backwards. To be honest, I didn't really believe in it. The tokens, men. - Now they're confused. Who should I grab by his beard? Okay, I see him. That is nonsense and very interesting. Here, drink one. You get used to it quickly. - Aren't you thirsty? What a misery. Sulfurix that suddenly pops up. After all this time. -Terrible. But who is ... But who is that Sulfurix anyway? Good that you ask. I'll tell you a story ... full of voice effects and tension. Sulfurix and Panoramix were two talented young druids. Always together, always working develop new techniques. Sulfurix and Panoramix were two little geniuses. I was a big fool. Atmosferix, you shouldn't say that. -I almost sent away four times. Anyway, at the Great Druid Competition ... Sulfurix suggested his flame powder before, that impressed the jury. Panoramix had taken a risk. He had chosen magic, simple and beautiful. And at Belenos, it was beautiful. His magic was magnificent, resourceful. I dropped my wine cup, really. The proof of his control of Druidism. After a long consultation, the jury decided ... that they could not do magic reward that had no practical use. "Nice but useless" was their conclusion. And they gave the first prize to Sulfurix. Yet Sulfurix did not have the career what he had hoped for. His magic came useful here and there. Then less and less and then no more. Panoramix is ​​the most respected Gallic druid became… thanks to his magic potion ... Sulfurix became increasingly bitter. He only practiced prohibitions magic and disappeared until this evening. But who was that guest? A druid? Thank you for asking. I'll tell you a story ... Is he good, bragger? O noble Panoramix, honored druid, it is an honor. Your counterpart, our dear druid 'Bazunix ... will introduce you to his young student in the hope that he may succeed you. Panoramix, this is Bitnix. I don't understand why the colleagues from the forest recommend him. If he becomes your successor ... I am Cleopatra's successor. Forward champion, let's see. Yes, I will take something from this bottle first. Those are nettles soaked in rainwater. In the second mixture have I done so many things ... I really don't know what anymore. And now, normally, if all goes well… What? - Well, it's fertilizer for the plants. No, but if you mix something and let ferment for a while ... then you usually get fertilizer, don't you? Well, Panoramix? Will he become your successor? You get it as a gift. Panoramix, my name is Janpatrix. But in the Woud der Carnuten, was my nickname Magnetix. That is not normal. Wait... That doesn't count. I'm starting again. Pay attention. Panoramix, my name is Olivix. I invented my own brew inspired by your potion. Look at this weak, sick man. The poor man. Drink it, dude. You really need it. Fantastic, right? Don't mind us. We don't want to disturb you. At Toutatis, what are you doing here? We are here to provide our expertise ... when searching for a successor. You are crazy. - It concerns us too. You will soon be bringing an idiot. We have enough of those. Wait, wait. Who guards the village? As acting head from our beloved village ... I would first of all want to express my pride. Nobody any more. Are they all gone? -No, the women ... children and bard are still there. All men are gone. The report was made by spies, so subject to change. As I always say, spies ... -Senator Tomcrus, shut up. Agreement. What are we doing? Let the legion the stock potion destroy. Then we'll see. What is that… -Ave Caesar. An intruder. Watchmen. Tell me, 0 Caesar ... I heard you speak about the famous magic potion that gives super powers. The formula might be you to interest? The magic potion of those idiots? - I mean that, yes. Do you have the formula? Not quite yet. I still have to go get it ... I still have to go get it ... in the mountains in the East. A formality. I give you the potion, Caesar. Then you can end it to those miserable rebels ... that has been bothering you and us for so long. But who says ... -What is. .. Excuse me, I'll ask. Who says you are not a fraud, Gaul? Good question. What I wanted to ask ... - Tomcrus, shut up now. That's my thing now. But ... But ... And what do you want in return for the potion? Nothing. -Nothing? Or is it. A small piece of land in Gaul ... that needs to be refurbished: the Woud der Carnuten. Agreement. I'm tired of walking. Do I get transportation to the mountains? A small convoy, something simple ... Discreet and unobtrusive. -That's all my thing. O druid. I still don't know your name. I'm a senator Gaius Frontinius Tomcrus. I wondered... Do not panic. Everyone in line for the reserve stock of the magic ... So tired on my mark ... My mother is ramming your harp through your throat if you bother. We have not received a potion. Attacking my order. Centurion. -What? So we go the reserve stock destroy magic potion? Yes, for the hundredth time. At the first attack they are not yet in reserve. No, in principle there is still much. So it's actually ... as usual? On my order. To attack. To attack. So now they have used up their potions? That's correct. -Decision, mission successful? Absolutely. I really want to say: bravo, everyone. I understand you're busy, but it's full moon. It is still light. -A druid doesn't work at full moon. It is not a matter of day or night. -I have to. Maybe Panoramix is ​​coming. If he sees that you work at full moon, he turns around. We will see that again. Talent alone is not enough. There are also rules. Are you okay? I'm getting too old to climb trees. Are you a druid? I do not know you. -What is that all there? I prepare myself. -Upon which? The large Panoramix is ​​looking for a successor. -Who? Who is looking for a successor? Panoramix. The biggest druid that ever existed. I do not know. I'd agree first organize your work table. My work table? It is perfectly arranged. Distilled water must be on the right. -Why? You are left-handed. Then everything is wrong. - Exactly. My master Zurix has me always said to do it that way. Ah, those rules ... I leave distilled water here. But... -Water distilling takes a long time. River water works great. You don't manipulate the ingredients, you work with matter. Druids are not there to make soup ... but to paint, to sing, to illuminate ... to prove that magic exists. So centurion, small question about the potion. Do they have anything left or is it gone? What about Again, I see their stock not from here. Yes unfortunately. -So, by my order ... They still have some magic potion. To attack. I'm Blodimerix, versatile drove in the service of magic. Panoramix, I am Tectonix. Panoramix. I'm Klimatosceptix and my specialty is ... To attack. Panoramix, we are the Fratellix brothers. Panoramix, I promise you will never give up the recipe. To attack. Except for tourists who pay big money for it ... I'm Platopmijnbuïx. I'm Syndicalix. -We are the four Fantastix. I said, traveling by boat is not smart. We just have bad luck that the first candidates were disappointing. You put the herbs in this, the distilled water. See? A folding roof. And that is for your Golden Pruning knife. Sorry. I have no golden pruning knife. That is why my mixtures fail. Now you suddenly think that you are a bloody fool? I take my chance. Maybe it's okay then recipe to someone from our village. A fishmonger can still do well become druid. That becomes something with you as a person. With this I can prune mistletoe, but also edit the face of a blacksmith. Hack. You can't even get a golden pruning knife make me a fool. You can get a beating. - Gentlemen, take it easy. Do not fight. - Maybe a drink? Good wine rejoices a human heart. That remains to be seen, but please calm down. I went too far. If you want to become a druid, I don't stop you. You must be right. It will never be something with my mixtures ... Bunch of idlers. Do not use anything. Our efforts disrupted. - Really, shut up. I have changed the formula. He shouldn't explode anymore. It goes the fishmonger druid better off, right? What does your mixture do? -It doesn't explode. "Look, Panoramix, a mixture that does not explode. " You don't even have a mixture, prutser. Look at our Heroix. -Aplusbeïsgelix. My brother. Good to see you again, old man. And everyone is there. How nice. Bye, men. Obelix, round and healthy? Asterix, still skin and bone? The good old days. Good old days? -When we fought against Rome together. You have not fought much against Rome. Not good for business, of course. Asterix, how can you say that? Yes, it was naive, believing in a good one rapport with that Roman gear. I have learned my lesson. What's in the wild boar sauce? A plum? Which idiot has plums put in the sauce? This is not Rome. No dates and pine nuts? - They're in there too. Scandalous. Horrible. Throw all those cooks for the lions. Or give them up. -Can we see that young druid? I'm telling you, he's a rock with Jupiter. Toutatis. Colchix, leave Panoramix but see what you can. 0, large Panoramix. This is a classic mosaic tile: the god Mars with his helmet, the legionary eagle and the olive branch. Everyone has that at home, but one single motif becomes a bit boring. I dip the tile ... Go ahead, go ahead. I immerse the tile in this liquid. Now we see fierce gladiators and the noble Caesar who grants them grace. And now he is different again. Mars. Gladiators. Mars… Dear Heroix, Asterix, I swear on Belenos de Schitterende ... that there is no Gallischer village then mine exists. Do it again. You are not really convinced. -Yes, it's fine. But? - But it's normal. It is good, without pit. When Panoramix comes ... he will not be satisfied with a means to separate berries. This is about Panoramix. Did you not say that you did not know Panoramix? Nobody knows him better than I do. You can win the Big Competition if you do what I have taught you. The magic art with the butterflies? It is useless. I am not going to use useless magic show. You don't know Panoramix at all. Show the magic art, Teleferix. Then that potion is yours. No. I'm going to do my magic with the berries. Then it's just normal. I am not going to show him magic is not mine. Certainly not useless. You are a sensible boy, Teleferix. Don't let your honesty ruin everything. That is our last chance. Too bad, said. -This is perhaps the least bad one. You're not gonna tell me ... -If I train him ... We are not going to take that guest, are we? Take it easy. We are not at home here. -I really like him. If we have one like that somewhere else find the same thing with cheese ... Listen, O traveler. Listen, o traveling merchant. Listen to my message. O traveler. Whether you are a traveler ... or just a walker ... - Stop that babbling. They have to believe you. I'm a senator. This is not really part of my job. I am not interested in your work. Make them believe you. Listen, you who are on the way. Listen to the young prophet who is a victim of his success. A little less with those birds. What do the gods tell us? What? What did you say? 'A kicking hybrid stiffen among the dwarfs'? No, I don't hear well. My left ear is definitely inflamed. What to? "A brave druid." staying here in the mountains'? Gods, what are you telling us now? An unprecedented talent young druid Up there on the mountain? I know enough, O Gods. I will now magically disappear. What kind of an idiot was that? Is it from here? He talked about a young druid, right? You don't believe him, do you? We have no more chips, it's done. Unfortunately no replacement. -I'm not interested in those tokens. A druid lives in the mountains. That is Teleferix. -Excuse me? That old fool was probably talking about Teleferix. Does he have a good reputation? -Yes, he's not bad. But multiply sandwiches, I can do that alone. You are clearly irreplaceable. -Absolutely. We are going home. Only when I've seen the last druid. How is that possible? We are all over Gaul been with those stupid chips. In vain. Don't get angry. I'm not mad. I will also stumble. I almost fell. Well, this is my successor. The new best warrior in the village. Sword, helmet, potion ... Have fun with it. I am gone. I'm fed up with it with all those stiff heads here. Obelix, are you coming? -No, Mr. Asterix, I'm not coming. Not if you are an old man if you choose a replacement ... instead of your so-called best friend. Good trip, Mr. Asterix. Asterix. Asterix. Don't be faint now. Panoramix ... Do something please. -Asterix is ​​free to go. I have to complete my mission. If necessary, I only go into the mountains. Do you not notice anything? -No, I never come here. I can never participate. - Look around. It is a bit dusty but I have not furnished it. There is no longer a drop of magic potion. And since you are village chief ... -Really? As the village head you have to tell us what we have to do. Well, I think as a village chief that there is nothing else to it ... then hope the No longer attacking Romans. Is that good? Or not? Come on, let's break up the camp. And be quiet. When they see us, everything falls into the water. What inspires me to entrust you with this task? Had someone else chosen. -If the Gauls stay away ... Why? My explanation was clear. -If it fails, I tell Caesar. Then I tell Caesar that you are one rude, mean, bearded villain ... Come on, break up the camp. What do we have here? A Gallic warrior. What kind of a dirty area is this, Sulfurix? -Dirty area? I'm an old friend of Panoramix trying to help him. You want to sell the formula to the Romans. Well, the Romans are rich. I want as many people as possible take advantage of the potion. Then everyone is equally strong. I'm a peaceful man, Asterix. -You are the worst of all druids. No. There is one that is even worse. He saves his knowledge for one handful of stupid fighters ... while he can redeem all his people from Rome. Ridiculous. What if Jan and everyone else will he have a potion? Be happy, we'll know soon. ... who is kicking me out while I'm a senator am. That is more than a druid. What is the Gaul doing here? - Your men must hurry. Break up the camp and tie that Gaul. Otherwise he warns the rest. I said you should not disturb me. I pour this in here. - Give it up anyway. It doesn't work anyway. - I changed it. I pour this in here and then I count to ten. If it hasn't exploded then it's okay. Ready? A... You have the ranking of your work table reversed? I'm left-handed. Then cross your arms. You are not the first left-handed druid. Go ahead, Teleferix. Show the magic art, Teleferix. Then the potion is yours. Where is he now are you all busy? I don't want to scare you, but I think you have competition. I don't know. It's nice, but what's the use of it? Nothing. Nothing at all. Teleferix, do you want to become my successor? Yes. On to the Woud der Carnuten, where you can reach the next Blue Moon ... takes note of the formula for the magic potion that provides super power. It does have something to be the owner. Caesar still has to get his magic potion. A formality. -That doesn't take away ... Look at that. Druids are allowed don't actually write. Then why is it hanging here? a flashy sign at the entrance? No idea. -And their cairns. Making piles. They can. Bunch of hypocrites. Say, you're on fire. -At Belenos. I am crazy about those hypocritical druids. Give it a hand. - Pull out the cloak. Pull out. I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. What now? Nothing to do about it. -The successor. The formula. Wouldn't that happen here? Without a forest your plan will fail. What a spectacle. I didn't know what to do ... with that cursed forest. You are a genius, Tomcrus. A genius. We have said so that you have to stop messing around. How do you get it ready? -My drink hasn't exploded ... so I drank it. I was not allowed to miss that opportunity. This is better than explosions. Absurd, a fishmonger on a cord. - You don't have to drag him along. The Woud der Carnuten. At Toutatis. Panoramix, how should that be with the transfer? The next Blue Moon is about one couple of hours. We can't miss that. The cairn. -The what? Rebuild that cairn. -At once? And now? -That's all. Everything? -I told you everything. Panoramix. I have have never seen such wild boar. Instead of walking away, they come at me and they continue to grunt. Quick, Obelix. Walk. Walk to the village. -What is it? What is happening? Walk. But? And we? What are we doing? Who still has magic potion? Turn me around. I can't follow it all. Poor sheep. Is it better that way? What a disaster. Now we are never in the village on time. Obelix. Under those trees, there. Obelix. Walk past those bushes. Those are the ingredients for the potion. The village. -If the wild boars just grunt ... then there is no drop of magic potion more in the village. Quick, Obelix. The beech in it. You can rattle all the Romans. Obelix? Obelix? Obelix? -What does he have? And the bag? Where is the bag of ingredients? I have to go to my cabin to make a potion. My pruning knife, where is my pruning knife, at Toutatis? There is... Panoramix. Good evening, children. Do not panic. Okay then, a little panic is justified. All right. Is there really no more magic potion? Stay here. -We'll go with you. Far too dangerous. But you are very brave. One day you say to a kid ... that he must hide, and you will defy the enemy. Stop that nonsense. He is not doing so badly yet. Yes, but it could be better. -It's a start. A mini start. They don't come out. -What to? The witches don't come out. -The potion is used up. The plan works. So the sustainer really wins? We can finally give Caesar the good bring news. Mars forward. Don't you think this is the moment, Teleferix? The moment? -Do you know him? A kettle, the ingredients, a village in danger. You're not going to make the potion, are you? -Panoramix did not instruct me. If you have the formula, you must use that. This is force majeure. Don't do it. What kind of mess is this here? We discuss which strategy is the best. A strategy? You just muddy. You would make something together. -We don't agree. I'm the oldest. I said we have to make a powder that blinds. That's stupid. Half of us are already blind. We have to make a speed drink. And what are you going to do with that, Grandpa? -What I normally do, just faster. You mean, thumbs turning? I'm the only one with a smart plan. A magnifying drink. Extensively tested. Hand it out. Now it's enough. My ingredients. My ingredients. How do I make my potion now? No, Teleferix. Do not. I have to save the village. - Quiet girl. I'm almost done here. Very interesting, that formula. And that simple. I would almost dare say something fog, one last ingredient. The last ingredient. -What last ingredient? The final ingredient of the potion. -But that's really all. How can you not know that Panoramix add the most important thing last? Don't know the formula? Idiot. He didn't trust you. Panoramix has certainly picked it. What have you not used yet? Maybe this is it? Or else that? Yes, it must be. With Toutatis, it must be in this. What a fool in his curse could have stopped a potion? You have sabotaged everything. You are a traitor. Are you gonna drink that? -Shut up. Interesting. Very interesting. Take cover. - Yes, head Cakofonix. What are you waiting for? Where does that come from? -They don't aim at us. Then it's okay. -They do us a favor. Don't shoot, he's on our side. -Who is that again? Senator Gaius Frontinius Tomcrus. Do it open centurion. Caesar's order. Focus the attack on the village. And give me some light. I will soon break my legs. No more wars. That is the real usefulness of the magic potion of that old monkey. Sulfurix, to your power now comes to an end. It is over with that mustache village idiots. Done with Asterix, with… What is that? Soldiers. Shooting at ... Shoot the chickens. Stop attacking, idiots. Now that your potion has run out? Are you kidding? And what will you do about it? Something's not right here. He's on our side. He has no reason to attack us. Panoramix. I have taken what was left. Horrible. Teleferix has the magic potion made where Sulfurix was present. Pull back. To the beach. That's an order. Say, we can do it retire with you? Does Teleferix really have the potion made? Did you see that? Then you will make it now. Think carefully and do everything in the same order. I never succeed. Finally, add a drop here without anyone seeing it. And what about you? - Everyone has to leave here. Take Pectin to the beach. -And you? Makes you get away. At Toutatis. It's not going fast enough. -The village burns down. That is… Do you really not need any help? We brew more often. Also the magic potion? - Not that, no. Centurion, should we help them extinguish? No, we cannot do that. So we are not attacking? -No, we can't do that. Are you not running anymore, old man? Do you dare it? finally take on me? I don't intend to. - Can you still do that? You have a little stir in soup there you use famous talents for? That's why you want a successor so badly. You are blunted by always making the same soup. Now you can do nothing else. Maybe you are deliberately jumped out of that tree. You are no longer a druid. Obelix. My beautiful village. No village chief should experience something like that. We need magic potion. -I'm trying my best. Pectin. Can I help you? Stay here, boy. Stay with the champions. You would be charmed from my student from the Alps. A quitter without fantasy, like you. Too bad you didn't trust him. Was he too stupid? He looked too much like his master. He is not a worthy successor. That's nobody. I'm the only one, Panoramix. You know that. Give me the last ingredient and I will spare everyone. Gauls, Romans and even you. Sulfurix, I disappear preferably together with my formula ... then I give it to you. All right. The potion is ready. Girl, now we can maybe help. Panoramix. Everything fine? -It could not be better. And? My brew works well. Attack. It's up to you. Come on. Come on. Drink. Very nice, but it's useless. Have you been drinking the potion? -Not so much. What is that? Very nice… Now we will see whether it is useless. Men, view this brand new one ship, the sign of a new start. Many may have thought: that never comes ... The potion works for a long time. - It won't last, Roman. He works fairly long with me, but then ... Finito. He still works. -Cubitus, take it easy. Did you have something, fat guy? Now you don't have much talk anymore, wild boar. Come on if you dare. Now it's over. I thought I could go on for a while. Time to go home. You are not a bad boy, Teleferix. But if I were you I would start from the beginning. No, I don't have the potion, O Caesar ... and I have not seen that druid anymore. And the village ... That's really a shame, because it didn't matter ... Anyway, in the end they have the potion still. They are unbeatable ... But you now know that. The responsibility of one village chief, which is huge. Fortunately I could still trust on my experience as an artist. We usually hit him anyway just out west, huh? How does that work? - That made Pectin. That way I can bring in my husband without it that the cord drags over the ground. Panoramix. Our fellow villagers and I want to tell you ... that we are worth nothing without the potion ... and the potion nothing is worth without you. My very best Heroix, best friends... the potion and me are worth nothing without you. Why so sorry, Pectin? -I can't forget him. What? -The formula of the potion. I try, but it doesn't work. Are you trying very hard? -Really. I know I can't remember him. It's way too dangerous. Only you may know him. Don't worry, Pectin. You will eventually forget him. Sure? -Yes. Or not. Worked out.
