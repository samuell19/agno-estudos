I suppose our lives are really just a collection of moments, Some moments tell us who we are, others what we might have been. - Hey, - Hey, chief. It's about time, boy. You're going anywhere in particular, Terry? Going to see my daddy. Your know man was supposed to come fishing with me before I got to go. He's working. Well, some day. when he's not working. OK. All right. Happy birthday. Thanks. I marked my ninth birthday at the moment. I tried to cross the distance dividing my father with me. I went looking for my father in a world he kept separate from me the world of summer, people who came to Rose Point. My father worked as their caretaker, opening their mansion cottages at the end of May each year and maintaining them through the long main winters. It was a place where people named their houses North Winds, Fairhaven, Cattle Cove and here Serenity Cottage. Making money right now. It's like an ice What are you doing there t you lost? Thought you were going to the carousel. For me, we go together. Can't I work to do so? I have a job. These people could take away my job just like that. - And then where would we be? - Poor. You've got it, Wentworth family is coming up to Serenity Cottage for Christmas again. They want a skating rink. - Where they come from. - New York City. It's backwards, you know, no heat. The pipes will freeze because people are just silly sometimes. Anyway, have a mountain to climb to get this place ready. Can I help? Get the door. Don't touch anything. Look, this isn't a place, for kids. His shop was my father's kingdom, a place where my mother, when she was alive, had never been welcomed. This was the center of his life and I longed to be a part of it. You still have to put the shutters on Serenity. Be sure to dress warmly now. Good morning, Mac. Good morning. Want some coffee? That's all right. I just stopped by to drop something off. For me? Maybe you should wait for Christmas to open up and. Go ahead and open it now, it's a birthday present too. Well, fingerprinting kit. Just like the ones we use at the station. We got to get going. Go out and freeze to death here, too. What do you say? - Thanks, Chief. - You're welcome, sir. You go and keep your old man in line now. Well, come on, get him settled. Where are we? The reason why I let you talk me into this. Here we are. Everything looks great, Mac. Thanks, Mac. Thanks a million. And you. You must be your father's right hand man, Charles Wentworth. Strong handshake. Good. How old are you? - Nine. - Wow. You're tough your age. This is my daughter Katherine. And she's going to tell Teri how old you are. I'm four. OK. So what do you want for Christmas? I already got this. It's fingerprinting kit. Wow, look at that. People should be getting your fingerprint. Put your thumb here. First, mine. And your other fingers, there. Fingerprint. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Look how pretty yours are. Here, you want to keep them. Thank you. Know what? I'm going to put these in a safe place. Are we going to see the sick children, Daddy? Yes, we are, sweetheart. I want you to go upstairs and wash your hand. And then go down. I'll be right back. Sure. Come on, sweetheart. Let's get those hands washed and something warm to drink. - Don't remember it being this cold. - Winter, ma'am. Oh, not that again. My husband has been apologizing for my money ever since he began spending, but he makes up for it on the tennis court, don't you, dear? And the golf course, he used to be an all-American football. That's enough, dear. It's enough. Hey, Mac, let your son come with us. It's a tradition of mine. Every Christmas, we try and cheer up the children at the hospital. We won't be gone long. Oh, come on, Mac, it's Christmas. Christmas is a time for children, right? Come on. Come on. Other children here. Oh, you look like you need a Christmas present. All right. Oh, merry Christmas to your friend over there. Merry Christmas. Thank you, Chris. Can you skate? - Not really. I have skates. She can really fly across the ice, can't you teapot? But you can't. I will back to the cottage in no time. You all right? Are you all right? We need to make it right. And look at everything else the government tries to get the. It's OK, let me help you catch. There. Going to be OK. - What happened? - A woman is dead, a child is in surgery. They broke down by the side of the road, and they were ran over the road them. - He's disappeared. - Disappeared? We're out looking for him now. Thank you for bringing them home. Shouldn't have been in that man's car. Someday you'll know who you are. Where you belong. There were a lot of prayers at Christmas. Prayers that the child would survive, prayers that Mr. Wentworth would be found. None of the prayers was answered. Mrs. Wentworth had my father close the place that winter. He never took me to work with him again. Hey Terry. Very nice meet. That's right. Dad, what are you doing here? Thanks for coming. Oh, no... ceremony over already. Should've known better than to expect you to be there. Well, Mr. Jacoby called me, and I nd I didn't expect it to be this long. Couldn't you get one of his other lackeys? To give him? - What did you say? - You heard me. Climbing over that gate, you can get arrested for that. Never had a criminal in this family before. We've never had a family. Never had a family? I've been working for all my life, a bunch of people that don't care about you. I've spent my entire life fighting for you. Well, dad. You did a great job. You get out of here, out here now, and don't ever bother me at work again. I better let you go. I think I hear Mr. Jakovčić calling. I hope you get a big tip for this. You know, your problem is. Well, I will be. Shoving off pop Try to keep in touch. That day, I took a vow that I would be a better man than my father. I wouldn't lose sight of the things that are important. Charlie, that outline you sent over is totally unacceptable, Bill Sanders is never going to approve. No, I need to hear back from you ASAP. And if you can't reach me here, try me on my cell. I want to hear back from you right away. Hey, Bill, what's up? - That was the deal, got the green light. Well, I told you not to worry. That takes care of your weekend. - Sorry, - That would be. I talk to you later. All righ. Wendy, there it is. I need that by noon. All right. Dermot Quinn, Terry. Is your father. My daughter wants to speak with you. Hi, my father is a patient here. His name McQuinn. I'm sorry, I'm not finding him. How do you spell that? M c Q u i n n. That's the last name. Oh, I'm sorry. I better call his doctor for you. Your father? He died, I'm sorry. This is a very nice piece. They should get a good price. Mr McCain, did you have a list of things you'd like to keep? I haven't been back here in 20 years, you can sell it on the auction house- Could write you a check for five thousand for the whole lot? - 7500. - I'll have to check. I want everything out of here by the end of the week so the realtor can start showing the place. That would be no problem, sir. I never saw this, that your mother. She died when I was little, I thought my father got rid of all her photos after that, he never wanted any up. I walk towards Serenity Cottage thinking how far I adventured from this place and the person I'd been when I'd last seen it, the years now seem to have gone by in a flash. I wonder if my father had felt the same loss at the end, if he'd been surprised at how quickly his time at best. Please, give your number for my mummy. All right, I'm calling from Rose Point. Here's the number. It's two seven five five five one three nine for your mommy. OK. Hello. Hi, I'm returning a call to Mr. McQuain, there was a message last night. Oh, yeah, yeah, that was me. - ¿Is all OK, McQuinn? - I'm not Mr. McQuinn I mean, I'm not the Mr. McQuinn was opening your cottage for you. I'm his son. When I spoke with your father, you didn't tell me he had a son working with him. I'm not working with him. I'm here from California because my father died. Mr. Quinn died? Yes. Yes. I just spoke with your father on Monday. I'm so sorry. How well did you know my father? I didn't know him. I've never been to Ross Point. - We just spoke on the phone. - I'm leaving. And I was supposed to leave last night. I'm just trying to tie up some loose ends here. You'll have to find someone else to open your cottage for you if you're coming for Christmas. I have to go here. I'll try and call you back later, OK? I'm so sorry. OK, bye. Dr. Rand Paul, extension, two point five seconds. Dr. Ben. May I help you, sir? I... wanted to buy some presents for the children for Christmas. There's a tree for presents down the corridor. Would you like to contribute to the children's fund? I knew a man named Charles Wentworth. Did you? Yeah, I came to this hospital with one Christmas Eve a long time ago. We brought presents for the kids. That was the last time I saw him. 30 years ago on Christmas Eve after Charles delivered gifts for the children was a bad accident. You remember. I was on shift and the little girl came in, my family and Charles, who came to work here a few years after that, we became great friends. Is he still here? You know, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to mislead you. Charles is deadnow. Since he passed away, we established this fund. And every year at Christmas, we bring gifts for the children in his memory. I can show you something. I first met Charles right in here. He was standing here holding his mop and he was gazing out those windows. He worked nights. Every once in a while, I found him here on his breaks. He swore he could see the lights of Rose Point from here. Well. That's not possible. Do you know why you ran away? A police problem? It was an accident. There are no charges against him. Charles killed a woman and her child. I think it would have taken his own life if it hadn't been for his daughter, kept hoping you'd see her again because there was never any chance of that. Why not? His wife divorced him, took the child away, and he agonized over that. And then one evening, he just. I just didn't show up for work. And I thought, well, that's it's my fault. I finally pushed him too hard. Then his brother came, told me he died. So heartattack. Hey, how are you? Good you. I'm all right, thanks. I could use some help. That's what we're here for. What can I do for you? I'm looking for someone who could help one of the cottages out at Ross Point - I might be able to find somebody. - What's your name? - Terry McQuinn. My father was caretaker out there, Mac. Oh, I'm real sorry about your dad. Thanks. There's a work order in my father's shop to open up Serenity Kaddish for Christmas. Yeah, he was in here on Monday telling me about it after all these years. Went with daughters coming back. The daughter? Yeah, Wendy, can you hear me? I'm still in Maine. - Yeah, I know, - I know, I know, I know. Look. There are 14 different things I'm supposed to do in the office that they would look, I'm thinking to stay in here for a few days. There's some work here. But Wendy, you hear me. When all that... I'm losing you. Hold on. I'm going to go outside. Hola Can you hear me? Wendy? Yeah, you're breaking up, let's just put all my calls on voicemail and I'll check in later. Yeah, right. People say I should sell this place and I'm not smart enough. You follow me from Rosepoint. - I saw a light. - I thought I was helping a man open the cottage. ¿ My father? You're Mac's boy? I am. Well, that's something. You know, we're talking about you just the other day. Anonymous, my name is Warren Terry. I remember spending a lot of time here when I was a kid. Your father rebuilt most of these carousel horses for charged me a small fortune for the work, but he was worth it. And he was good at what he did. Oh, yeah, he was the best. So. - You came home? - I won't be here long. And I'm going back to L.A. in the next few days Knowing you don't want to stay around here this time of year. There's nothing but cold here. Oh, yeah. You catch your plane tomorrow. I can take care of the cottage for Mac. Nothing I can't handle their. So my father never told you, I guess. Serenity Cottage has quite a history. Oh, really? You don't see stars like this where I live. Too much smog. Oh. Yeah. Twelve bedrooms and a lock the gate, and I've ready to stay open, eventually I'll find the key. And your father sent his keys. Oh, that's good. I never asked you your name. Katherine. Katherine. Are you sure it's not going to be too much of an imposition? - Olivia. - Olivia, your daughter? Sleeping Beauty. She's on my lap snoring away. - Do you have any children? - No. I'm... a friend of my father's has offered to open the cottage for you, but I was thinking that I may stay around a few days to help them out. Oh. Oh, that would be very kind of. You are so excited. I've been telling Olivia that our main days are going to be live over days. Its so wonderful. Do you still want to leave? Anyway, I'll let you go. - Have a safe trip home. - Yes. - Good night. - Bye. You knew these were here. These photographs, all of these pictures your father saved 30 years ago before the movies could take them away. When he showed me these pictures for the first time, he said that nobody should ever be completely forgotten in this world. Your father and I had an argument after he got word to open up the place again for Christmas. I said we should take all these things away. Why? Sometimes things are better left the way they are. Mentioned my old man caring about these things. I talked to a woman at the hospital who knew Charles Wentworth. She told me he died. So I want to say something and want me to take over from here so you can catch a plane. It's nothing new that I can't handle by myself. You're probably right, I don't just hire you to open the cottage and head back home, but I'd like to stay a few more days, get things started with you. You know, it's amazing, but I'm actually enjoying getting some dirt on my hands for a change, huh? Whatever you think is best. - Hey, stick around for a while. - Yeah. I decided to stay and open the cottage for Katherine Wentworth. I didn't exactly bring the right clothes from California. Well, good for you. It's a big job. Yeah, but I get some help. - A friend of my father's named Warren. - Warren Wentworth. What did you say? Weren't the old timer from the carousel? Charles Wentworth, brother. You're a bad liar. I always was. you want to tell me the truth? I wish you hadn't come home from California. It's no offense to you, I don't mean to hurt you in any way. This isn't easy for anybody. What isn't easy? The truth. Symphony is on tonight. Another half hour. It's the warmth from the engines, I think, of them as fallen angel spread out like that. There's my brother. You told the woman in the hospital he was dead. Yeah, calibrates. She tried to fix what couldn't be fixed. He came apart after he met her, he couldn't go back to work. I thought that would be best. I don't know what's best. I don't know what's right. Anything. You want to leave those photographs in the college for Katherine, you can roll down the window to tell his daughters, coming up here, the arrows point for Christmas. I don't know the... Do whatever is in your heart? Why don't you hang out of this? - Are you still Growthpoint? - Yes... I should be leaving in a few days. Look, I, I meant to ask you, what room did you sleep in when you came here as a child? I'm in the midst of a... I've never been to Rob's point. My mother close the cottage after my father left her just before I was born. Your mother never brought you here? No. Too many painful memories, I guess. Oh, OK. Well, I see. I want to talk to you. Oh. Hello. Wat excited, Terry McQuinn.. It is snow there? Well, there's a little bit and I'm sure there's going to be quite a bit more when you get here. OK. Oh, hi. Well, thanks for everything. Don't mention it. So I'll I'll let you go then, ok. OK. Good night. Some making money. I'm making nice. The sky is blue with windows everywhere and shutters at. There's a huge porch and five chimneys that looks like a castle. It's really pure. Oh, oh. I thought we were alone here. - Have you come to Maine for Christmas? - No. I'm Terry McQuinn. Oh, you decided to stay. I did. Well, I'm Katherine. Nice to meet you. This is my Olivia. That's Lawrence, our family friend and driver living this is the nice man who opened our house for us. I remember Terry McQuinn. You do? Oh, from from the phone. Well. We'd better go in and get settled. Yes, it was a pleasure to finally meet you. It's great to meet you. Hopefully we'll see you again soon. Hi. Hello again, good morning. It's Terry McQuinn.. Yes, it is. Is everything OK? Yeah. You did so much work. I don't know how to thank you for that help. And it was good work. I enjoyed it. Good for the soul of you mean? Not for the hands. Are we to blame for that? It's just my own stupidity. Livy's been fascinated by the gate from the moment we first arrive at one of these keys, opens it. And I think it was the small one. Oh. I dropped it. Here mami. Wonderful. Thank you, love. You're welcome. Here, you may want to get yourself a copy. Sure. I'll get this right back to you. We've eaten, but have you had any breakfast? I have, thanks. And I was actually hoping that you'd like to go with me on a little adventure. Adventure. What did you have in mind? I'd like to show you something. Here, look what Olivia found last night. Lawrence said there are someone's fingerprints, a little Sherlock Holmes must have stayed on the cottage once. Here it is. Oh, Terry, Carrousel. Olivia, what a special surprise for us. Thank you, Olivia. There's a horse here that's been waiting for you to ride. Really? Come on. - I will lift you up. OK? - OK. I'm ready. Here you go. There you go. This one has a pretty many. Yeah, it's bumpy. I want to go mami. No cutie pie. A friend of mine runs this place, but he doesn't seem to be around. So how long's the carnage been in your family? My understanding is that my mother's grandfather bought it after making a fortune vending machine that made choices. Truly. Amazing. Does she see anything? Not anymore. Up until the first year, she could see bright lights. I was teaching her colors, but we never finished. I don't know, Terry. There's a lot that is sad all around us. But I'm trying to teach all of you that the world is still beautiful. I mean, bad things happen but doesn't make a carousel ride any less magical. I love the kids. Well, I'm glad you did. You know, when I was a little boy and the carousel was my favorite thing in the world. What's your favorite thing now in the world? That's a good question. I guess, Olivia, that I would have to say that my favorite thing in the world is the water. Where is the water that. It seems to go out forever, and there's this island right out in the middle, it's called Pumpkin Island. Oh, let's go there, Mommy. Oh, sweetheart, it's wintertime. It's much too cold. I'm not cold. Are you cold? Well, no. As a matter of fact, I'm not cold. Please, maybe we'll see. OK, we'll see. You grew up in a beautiful place. - I ran away from here. - To find fame and fortune. Oh, I don't know anymore just to be some place far away from Maine. You know, when I was a kid, I was so determined to leave here. And now that I'm back, the reasons why I left are becoming less clear to me. Don't we all try to escape where we came from one way or another? You think so? Yeah. My mother had all the money in the world and yet she was unhappy and all I wanted to do was to separate myself from that, do something meaningful. What was that? Social work? A far cry from Park Avenue. You seem content. Yeah, it's because of Olivia. - She's a beautiful little girl. - Yeah. Yes. And I first met her. She was nine months old and she'd already been in four foster homes. Nobody wanted a blind baby, not even my ex fiancee. I took her in, and I fell in love and couldn't give her away. She's lucky to have you. I'm the lucky one. You know, Katherine doing this work for you and Olivia. The nicest thing I've done in a long time. I'll give it a try. Sure, go on. Be careful, it's. How is it this is great. Oh, listen, tonight in the city, they're doing a deal on taxes, a child's Christmas in Wales. Would you like to go with us if you're not too tired from working? - I won't be too tired. - Good. We'll pick you up at seven 30. Do I need my tux? Who? Someone told me I might find some men down here to help clear the ice off kind of. You can ride the elevator up from here, Olivia. You go ahead, I'll be right there. Mummy. Excuse me, what any of you like to work for good wages. Ten dollars an hour more if you stay through Christmas. Can I take some of these men with me? Sure. - Pick you up here in the morning. - What time? Seven, OK. Thank you. Now, Wendy, it's Terry. I got your message last night, when you get in, you get this message. Tell Sanders I'm drafting a new version as we speak and I'll get it to you right away. OK, but. It's great that you found those man. - He has man them in the cottage. - Why? Terry has some nice men cleaning the roof of the cottage. It's going to be freezing out there. I don't know. Oh, that's right, Terry. I didn't call you. Olivia doesn't get cold. You you never. I think Jack really like it. Yeah, I do, too. How would you like to live here? But what about all my friends in New York? New friends here? Here is our friend already on. I feel like the Swiss family Robinson. Is staying off of there. Lift you out, Olivia? Thank you, Terry. OK. Oh, hey. You know what? if I was Jack, I would be so glad to have found a little girl like you. What is it? Our beloved dog, Sally. My mother taught her about a dog I had when I was a little girl. I don't remember the dog, but her name was Sally. So it's your dog mammy. That's my jacket. I found it. No, darling, it couldn't be. Let's go Olivia. We should start walking back. She's so independent, there will always be the most important person to me. It's funny, I, I don't know where it comes from, the closest I feel. Olivia has taught me to live in the present. It's this great gift that small children give to you. There's no future for a child. There's only what is here and now in front of you. This.? Hands are frozen. Everything will be OK. Moving on. Bradbrook. Come in. - Feeling better? - A hot shower thawed me out pretty good. Yeah, thank you. One of the men would like to talk to you. Sure. He's driving us back. You dry enough? Yeah. The other guys want me to ask you for our money. I said we could wait if you can't pay it now. Oh, no, no, of course, sure. But 100 for each of you may be enough. Oh, more than enough. OK, well, it's still a little wet from the lake And, you go. No, wait, please. Do you remember the man who was caretaker here, you knew him once. I'm his son. You and I have been gone a long time, but we've both come back. In the hospital, there are presents for the children. They have your name on them. Charles Wentworth. I be back tomorrow. No, no, I can use the help, sorry. Good morning. You sure California can survive this long without you, so. And try to help your brother. I guess he couldn't handle it. I want to show you something. You called me for a ride this morning. The first thing he's asked me for in five years. Don't anything to happen to him. I don't want to lose him. He was my brother long before he had anything to do with it. People would give. We have no right to keep them apart. When your father, first told me that she might be coming up here, I asked if he knew what kind of woman she grown into. And of course, he didn't. And I'm worried that she might be like her mother. She might hurt him. I understand that. I took them for a ride on the carousel. I know. I was there. You may have been right all along, Terry, but I'm still concerned my brother won't be able to face her. He sat in the car and waited for you to come back that night. Well, I couldn't help myself. It was an accident. It was a mother and her child. I came back here, though I used to sleep on people's boats in the harbor. I hid in the woods by the golf course. I was here. I was here hiding in the pumphouse from the movers came, I watched them. I never came back here after that. They took everything important. Not everything. My father saved some photographs of you with your daughter. So every year on December 25th, we celebrate the birth of Christ. C is for Christmas. But what do you want for Christmas, Olivia? I don't know. Santa Claus knows. I better get this angel down just a little while. It's like you've had a busy day. Live every day, Terry. - Well? - Gary, it's Bill, I've been all over wanting to get those contracts back from you. Yeah, I'm working on what she said. She said the two days ago, I'm doing them right now because I know it's not a good time. But I'm almost done. You're busy. I'll just. - No, no, no, no. - Come on, Bill. I'm I'll get them to you tomorrow. Simpy. Thank you. Lawrence survived that, but he has a cast iron stomach. Yeah. Fort Pierce, I'm. You fixed the slate here and your father's tools. Yeah, anything that doesn't fall apart an hour after I fix it is a miracle My father was here. He can do it five times better than 150. It's good. I've been thinking about what you said to me. About... how Olivia's taught you to live in the present. - How do you live? - The future, always. How do you have the future always for only as good as your next deal. The tough way to live? Yeah, I know. I didn't used to think so. Being here with you. What do you mean? I never knew it, but. I've been waiting a long time for this, looking for you. Olivia might not understand this. It's the right thing to do. You sure? I'm sure. When I adopted Olivia, I built this small world for us where I could love and protect her. I realize I've been protecting myself and. I'm scared to let anyone in. Katherine, that's why my father did. He built the small world for himself. Only worked himself to death because he never let anyone in. Not even his own son. Maybe he was afraid. My way. I think for the last 20 years, I've been doing the exact same things and I don't want to continue to make that mistake. Something. I want you to tell me your story tonight. Oh... well, I've never told a bedtime story before. I think I have an ide. - You're ready? - Yeah. Let's try it then. I told her a story about a bird who invades mailboxes and carries away all the unwanted mail, the bills and the sad letters. There was a child who befriended the bird and together they read all the letters he wrote them and took out all the sad part. How does it end? I'm not sure. Maybe it's better that way. The last night, she's wanted to sleep here. Thank you. - Would you do something for me. - what? I want you to go back in your mind to your earliest memory? - I don't have a good memory. - Let's try. Everybody says just try. You have to try. I remember... Our family doctor is sitting on the end of my bed telling me I had measles. I must have been about six or seven, I guess. Go back, father. I remember standing in the fog on my first day of school, I was wearing my shiny shoes, my mother said I call my patent leather shoes, my shiny shoes. I love them. I remember those shoes. You do, you're standing right beside me. She's an elastic straps and helderman. The right strap was loose and the chute kept falling off. You couldn't know that. Tell me, have you know that? I sprained my ankle and the bandage had stretched the elastic on my right shoe, you couldn't have known that. My ninth birthday, I was given the fingerprinting kit. This is you, Katherine. You were here in this house. I knew you when you were a little girl. This. Is your father you were here with him. - What are you talking about? - You were a little girl. You came to this point with your parents for the holidays? No, I never came here. I never knew my father. Yes, you did. Your mother divorced him and she took you away. But he's still here. You're not making any sense. The man who helped us the other day, the one who carried you from the boat, his name is Charles Stuff. Terry, stop, stop, stop. I've been wanting to tell you, Katherine. You didn't say anything. I was trying to do the right thing by keeping it from me. I feel like a fool. I went on and on about never having been here. - I'm so sorry. - You knew. My own father stood right next to me and, you know I was just trying to respect his wishes. I'm worried about why. Did you think I wouldn't care? I didn't know what to think. There wasn't any plan. When you first got here, I wanted to tell you, but then you seem so happy. I was worried it would upset you. Just go, please, Terry. Just go. I seem to have settled everything here. I'm on a flight this afternoon, so I'll be in the office in the morning. We'll see you at. No one really hearing. I wanted to come and say goodbye. I'm sorry, I have to go home now, it's time to get back to my job. Goodbye Terry McQuinn. Merry Christmas. Heading back to L.A. this afternoon. It was nice to see you again. I told Katherine everything she knows who you are. I didn't do it for you. This belongs to you. I think my father would want you to heaven. They look very happy, don't they? I remember that. Do you? How you pulled through first again, Terry. Pursey is in love with the deal. Well, that's good, I'm glad. That's a big boost for you up the partnership ladder. Terrific. I hate it.
