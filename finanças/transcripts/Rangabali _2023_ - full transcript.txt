Greetings. I am Shaurya, and I want to share something with you. I frequently fall down at this center. Oh no, he fell again! Oh, boy! Are you alright? Get up. In my village, they believe more injuries make you a greater hero! I don't feel content if people around me aren't noticing me. He's bleeding. Due to this overacting, people in my village call me "Show." His name is Agadham. Do you know why he is crying? Hey, what happened to you? My neighbor Shiva has to attend his grandmother's funeral rites. So he skipped school and is happily playing at home. He cries when he sees others happy. You might wonder when he's happy then. Why didn't you do your homework? Why?! He can't stand it when the people around him - are not in pain. - Does anyone still have doubts? - Meet my other friend, Jacket. - Teacher, it seems that your blouse is a bit loose. Let me make some adjustments and tighten it for you. Hey, idiot! Sit down! The eagerness with which one would watch a plane flying in the sky is nothing compared to the eagerness we feel when watching him take out his bike. He takes out his bike only when... there is a fight in the village that he must witness. Hey, Show, they are beating our team members. Bro, bring out the white shirt. I can't fight without white clothing on me. While I believed I was unbeatable in this village, one day, my mom took me to a neighboring village to attend a wedding. - Let him play. - I want to play too. You're the last to join, so you'll play the thief. Don't you know about me? I have a video game. - What video game?! Get lost! - Hey, my video game. Hey, what's this? Children, stop fighting. No, not like that... Why didn't you bring my white shirt? Why? What happened? I want to go back home. We'll leave in the evening. - Go. - No, I want to leave right now! Go! The lesson I learned that day is that a crocodile is strong underwater. But when it comes out, people will throw stones at it. To remain a hero forever, I must stay here in my village. So, my strength and my future both lie here. This is fixed! Hey, you took away the idol we ordered last time as well. This time I'll see who dares to take it away. I'll take it away this time. Let me see who stops me. Should I call Show? Why do you want to trouble Show for him? I am enough. Hey, stop. Call Show! - He isn't answering the call. - Call him again. You should have told me earlier that there is a fight scheduled today. Why? For what? I would have worn my underwear. Load it. Let's see who will stop us. Where are you? They are thrashing us. - Where? - Near the bridge. They are thrashing us and taking away our Ganpati idol. Come fast! For every quarrel, he wears his white shirt and comes back with a dirty one. Rascal! I'm tired of washing his white shirts. Hey, get a size L white shirt and wait at the shop. Nani... Your dad didn't have breakfast this morning. Give this to him on your way. It's hot, be careful! - Where is he?! - The idol is ours! Hey, give the box to my father. Hail, Lord Ganapati! Why are you so late? - Look how badly we got beaten up. - Bro, they took away our idol. Yeah, dude. Somehow get our idol back. Hail, Lord Ganapati! Who dares to stop us in our own village? Hit them! Hail, Lord Ganapati! Hail, Lord Ganapati! Lord Ganapati... Can you pull it single-handedly? He thinks he is Baahubali. - Look, they're laughing at you. - Pull it, man. Hey, not the rope, my shirt! Pull it, man. Wow! - Super! - Awesome! - Hail! - Lord Ganapati! Victory to Lord Ganapati! - Victory to... - Lord Ganapati! Hey, why didn't you come? To watch him fight? Why does he take off his shirt every time? Is it a show-off, or what? It definitely is a show-off. That's why it's needed. Has he taken it off yet? Hey, how can you talk like that? I built my body not to hide it... but to show it when the time comes. Has my body grown? Well, shall we invite the MLA for the idol opening? I have a shortlist. Should we distribute bats and equipment to our local cricket team members? How much money is in our treasury? - Negative 365 rupees. - Damn! Well, I'll manage somehow. I'll go to the shop. See you later. Hey, come. Let's go. Meanwhile, make all the arrangements here. Now, is he going to sell the medicines, earn money, and then donate it to our treasury? Yes, exactly. Okay. What about the money you earned from stitching jackets? Stop! Hey, stop! You go. Do you remember the head priest in that temple? He died two days after he wrote his birth chart. Stop it now. Please. I should have known right then that I should get rid of this scoundrel as soon as possible. Here, take this one after your breakfast and one after your dinner. - Did you get your shirt dirty again? - Just wait, please. I didn't have any breakfast. I had leftover rice. - Yes, it's okay. Yes. - Can I still have it? - Okay. I trust you. - Hey. Did I beat you today? I fell off the bike. I need some money... If someone asks him suddenly about his education, - Get lost! - he can't name his course properly. All the medicines in the shop are running out as they are used to treat the people who have been beaten by him. I don't understand whether I am running this pharmacy for the people or him. Hey. Arrange some money, dude. Next week, my dad won't be here. I'll take care of the counter, and I'll give you back the money then. I don't have any money, bro. Why are you talking to him? If you talk to him, you'll forget whatever little you have learned here. The only business in this world, which is always loss-making, and yet people run that business despite being in debt, is the business of raising a son. Loss-making? Hey, why have you prescribed ten different medicines? I couldn't diagnose him precisely, that's why I have given him ten different medicines. Anyone might work. Listen, you go to the hospital and get treated. Go. Mr. RMP, get lost from here. Go away! Okay, don't get tense. Why do I have to bear all the fools of the world? You don't have any ancestral property to depend on. You better learn to handle the shop well, or else I will give away the shop to that little one. He shall take care of it. He owns a medical shop after all, but he behaves as if he has landed on the moon. - Stop it! - Can't I take care of it? Ask him to let go of the ownership. I shall clean up everything by myself, I mean, manage it by myself. If you are really that good, get me the tablets written in this prescription within two minutes. - What if I get them? - Do it first. - Please give it to yourself. - I will only give it, don't worry. One. Dear, this old lady has asked for medication to have a bowel movement, and your son has given her tablets that cause menstruation! - Oh, God! - What should I do with him? - Hey... - If we make the customer wait for so long and then give them the wrong medicines, will they ever come back to us? When you are working in a pharmacy, you should double-check the medicines you are giving. He is not capable of that, but this scoundrel wants to take over the counter instead. Mom, please stop him. What do you want? What do you want? Why are you laughing? What do you want? What is it? Enjoy! Not only reading the prescription, you must also be able to read the facial expressions and give them what they want. Wait! Stop there. I'll fix you today. Thanks, Dad! - Hey, money! - Bye, Mom! - Long live... - Mr. MLA! We don't know any directions We just follow you Just like the temple has a tower And a school has education This village has you! You won't find this piece anywhere From China to Chennai Our man is number one He makes zero too valuable Even the PM needs our man's permission Even the PM needs our man's permission If he wants to step into our village Bro, I think we are going overboard. Who dares to stop us in our village!? Hit them! Show me attitude and face my wrath Get your face smashed Nobody can stop us If you are my friend You'll receive royal treatment If you are not, I'll snap your bones! Bikes and autos have our brother's photos A selfie with Brother Show Is the only license you need This village wouldn't exist... This village wouldn't exist... If you were not born, brother! Bro, all tasks are assigned. I have mobilized 200 people to organize the bike rally. Carry on, brother. Sure, bro. - Hey, take this. - Why all this, brother? Okay, bye. Instead of being a servant In a foreign land Enjoy with your friends in your own land Even Lord Shiva finds comfort in Kailasa The comfort of your hometown Is unparalleled! That's why staying in our hometown is... Get lost! Hey... Where's the energy?! Raise 300 rupees for each person. Light the drums on fire! Whose jacket is this? - Adilakshmi's. - Who? The one who warned you that if you ever trouble her, she will kill herself. The same one. Did the measurements change, or are they still the same? Scoundrel! They are continuously calling me for the payments. - Talk to them first. - Greetings, brother. Have some biryani. Get lost! I don't want this. There are no pieces in this. You ate everything. - There are no pieces? - Who's calling me now? Hello. Really? Superb. - Who is it? - You remember Hari, right? His marriage is fixed. He's getting four acres of land as dowry. Will one-acre cost five million? It's eight million. Damn! These people aren't letting me live peacefully. Dude, I don't want it. You can eat it. I know very well how to get back at him. - Hello, bro. - That's alcohol... - Greetings, brother. - Greetings. Tell me. I need your help. Job opportunities have been announced for positions in the Secretariat. If you could talk to the MLA... We can pay him if needed! Hey, no, I don't. Do you have a degree certificate? I have spoken with Mallesh, he said he will arrange a duplicate degree certificate for a sum of 30,000 rupees. Do you drink? No thanks, brother. Recently I had a cocktail of whisky and brandy, and since then I haven't been feeling well. Hey Viswam, why did you close your shop so early? The last bus has already left. It's 10:30 at night. Is this early for you? What are you doing here? I have had a stomach ache since this morning. I came to you hoping you could prescribe some medicine for pain relief. Do not drink all brands together. If you don't stop eating junk food, this is what will happen, Bhaskar. Listen to me carefully... Listen to me... Take 90ml of alcohol... Have some cumin seeds along with jaggery. If the pain persists, come back tomorrow morning. - Okay. - Go now. And take a chilled water pouch. Make a hole. Put the glass down, then squeeze the water pouch into the alcohol... and mix well. There will be small bubbles in it. Then the drink is ready. As soon as that first sip touches our lips, our nerves start to fray, and Anushka will appear in front of us. - Dad? - Anushka, do you want to have a drink? Useless scoundrel! What happened? What happened?! I'm advising people about medicines for their ailments, and my son is teaching young boys how to drink as if he's an expert in this field. What should I do with him? Not only that, he changed the payment barcode to steal money from me. - Hey! Get down, you scoundrel! - Dad! Come down. I'll see your end today. Come down! Let me take a shower, and then I'll deal with you. Listen! If I see him in this house or this village again, I'll dig his grave with my own hands! I'm talking to you! Pack his bag. He is leaving for Visakhapatnam tomorrow morning. He must complete the course at Suryanarayana's college, or I will not allow him to enter this village or my house. If you don't comply, you may leave along with me. Okay. Stop shouting. Where is my lungi? It's in the laundry. Then what should I wear now?! Is the hot water for him? I'm shivering due to the cold, and that scoundrel needs hot water? Stop it! Stop it, first! Don't irritate me. I'm waiting for your money. Listen to me, bro. I'll somehow arrange it by morning. If you want, I'll give a free jacket to your wife, but don't call me so many times. Damn! Useless fellow! He disconnected the call again. I'm tired of stitching these jackets, and on top of that, I need to pay his bills too. I'm being caught in the middle of the father and son. Hey, like a honey bee stealing honey from a jar, what's this? Why are you stealing from your own shop? Oh, God! Why are you pushing me?! Listen to your dad, complete that course in Vizag obediently, and take care of the shop. How long will you roam around aimlessly and attract evil eyes upon yourself? What are you talking about? It's not a curse to be in people's eyes, it's a gift! Stop this nonsense! Nani, he is very serious this time. If you don't go to Vizag, he will kick me out along with you. I have packed your bag as well. Turn on the flashlight on your mobile. Why? Your father threw away a soap in anger, - and I need to find it. Precious soap! - What, Mom? - Soap! - You... My life is being ruined, and you're worried about the soap! Go away. Go. Bharat went to his brother Ram and said, "I don't want this kingdom. Please take it..." Even the great nobles had to experience exile. So, if I have to become mentally and physically strong, I need to settle down first. I must someday take over the shop. If I don't look after the shop, I won't have money. So, for that, I need to undergo training and leave this village for a few months. If you want to stay in this village permanently... you must face this temporary exile. It's inevitable! SRI SHAURYA MEDICALS How much longer? Tell him to hurry up! - Coming! - I can't bear him. Wait... Take these snacks with you. No, I don't want... Don't act embarrassed now! It's unavoidable now. I have packed ten pairs. Don't get them dirty. Instead of asking him to mend his ways, you're advising him to be cautious? You're great! - Careful, Son. - Sorry, Dad. - Sit properly! - What's his problem? Go to the shop. I have asked the worker to come early today. I'll drop him off at the bus station and come back. Am I going by bus? What are you saying? Everyone will be there, and they will tease me. Let's call a cab, Dad. - What will happen?! - The bus will leave. What? Come here! Oh, God! Why do you always fall at that center? - Subbu! - Uncle? Don't let him get off in the middle of the journey. Call me if he tries to get off anywhere else. Drop him off directly at the college. - Okay. - Get in. Money? You remember this well, don't you? VISAKHAPATNAM Hey! Here. Thanks, Dad. Dad, another hundred. You will never change. Go and get on the bus. Eat if you get hungry. Here, take the water bottle. Be careful. Okay, Dad. The bus is moving, so take out the money quickly. Here... Show! Be careful! - Okay. - This RMP doctor is always annoying... - What are you doing here? - Coming. - Why did you come here? - Actually... There has been talk all around the village since this morning. - What is that? - That your father has kicked you out of the house. Moreover, everyone in this village is getting settled, and that makes me sad. Someone is getting married, someone claims to have earned two and a half million from shrimp farming. That Chadra, he doesn't know the number of zeros in a million, and yet he's earning tens of millions in real estate. That Rambabu, he once struggled to make ends meet, but today he is sending his selfies from Dubai. I can't tolerate all the good news in this village, - that's why... - That's why? I have decided to come with you so that your misfortune will make me happier. Shut up! Please bless me with a good brand of alcohol, God. Why is he laughing? - What kind of a sadist are you? - That's my nature. All youngsters are a little indifferent at this age. Don't worry about him. I can't describe in words what a jerk my son is! I need special blessings from God to be able to deal with that. This is very common in my profession. I have seen many boys like him during my service. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Your father wants you to take over the medical shop, and instead, you gave an old lady a tablet to induce menstruation? Nothing like that. I'm well aware of all the medications. He always lies about me. - Really? - Yes, uncle. Alright! What will you do if someone faints due to high BP? Look, Dean, coming straight to the point. Give us any brand you want, we won't faint from being inebriated. We don't vomit, nor do we waste anything in the bottle. What do you say, Mr. Show? Hey, talk into the microphone. Yes, uncle. He is always right. Yes, of course. Damn! - Here, BP doesn't mean Binder Sprite. - Then? I meant blood pressure. There's no brand named Blood Pressure, uncle. I don't think that is any liquor. Useless fellows! He might be confirming the name! I have never seen such guys before! I told you already. What did they do? - Your son is not wrong. You are at fault. - How? Instead of running a medical shop, run a wine shop. He will handle the entire shop single-handedly. Hey, Agadham! Your son is dedicated and focused on the liquor brands but not on the medications in your medical shop. That's what I told you. That's my problem with him. What should we do now? What can we do? Only if he becomes capable of managing the shop will he be allowed to enter the village. Otherwise, hire him in your college as a clerk. Oh, no! Okay. Let's see what we can do. What did my father say, uncle? Will he open a wine shop? Look, dear, we don't have any special courses for you. The most I can do, even for your father, is to have you assist a junior doctor for three to four months. - Think about it. - Okay, uncle. Uncle, we are not here to think. We are here to take action! Who the hell are you? What do you do? I'm a social worker, uncle. I can't bear to see someone happy. Okay, come to the college starting tomorrow. There will be a girl named Alekhya in the third year. Meet her. You may stay in our dormitory. Are we staying with Alekhya, uncle? Where did you find him? Work hard. Youngsters like you should be very dedicated. Oh, dear Lord! You haven't seen anything yet. You'll fall ill if you witness my dedication. I'm already ill. I'll take my leave, uncle. - Come, let's go. - Let's go. Nice to meet you, uncle. It was a progressive meeting. Looking at him, I remember all the forgotten swear words. It's a large college, dude. Come. - Do you know Alekhya? - Alekhya... Her... - Come. - Are you not? - Come. - She was pretty. There's a new restaurant outside our college. - Alekhya? - Should we go? It's me. Tell me. - The Dean asked me to meet you. - What's wrong with her? - Yeah, about pharmacology, right? - Yes. Sir, why is everyone asking for me? I have an exam tomorrow. There will be a girl named Sahaja in OP. Meet her. - Okay. - Why are you sending them to Sahaja? It's okay, sir. Sahaja won't mind. Hey, there was a meeting scheduled yesterday for non-locals. Why didn't you attend? Personal problems, sir. He is taking the seniors for granted. No, sir. I respect the seniors. No, he doesn't fear us. I do. I do fear you, madam. - Will you urinate out of that fear? - Sir? Will you urinate out of that fear? Then urinate. Okay, sir. - Enough. You may continue elsewhere. - Okay, sir. He is the Dean's personal responsibility. He is here to learn the basics of pharmacology. Do you own a medical shop? What's with that look? As if you carry a terrible flashback. Wait. Wait. Did you ask me to wait? I thought you asked me to pull. Hey! Starting tomorrow, wear formal attire, okay? Bro, Alekhya is sending him to Sahaja. Alekhya?! Sir! Why are you sending them to Sahaja? Can't you explain them? I asked them to stay, sir, but they didn't listen to me. - Come... - Who is she? Come! He is being possessive about sending a good-looking guy to Sahaja. Am I really that good-looking? Shameless! - Wait... - Wait here for ten minutes, I'll be back. Okay. I knew this would happen when I mentioned Sahaja. Sahaja! She must be quite famous, isn't she? If we want similar publicity in our village, it will cost us 10,000 rupees. Learn from her! You're always busy taking off your clothes. We must meet Sahaja... Did he manage to escape from me? Show? - Okay? - Okay, sir. - Did you give him the medicine? - Yes, sir, I gave it to him. Not there. Look at me. Look at me. Smile! And it's done! Sir, please come back after five minutes. Dean... He must be in the admin block. Sahaja? Dean asked me to meet you. Where is your friend? Where is the pathology lab? - This way. - You may leave. Idiot! Oh, regarding Pharmacology? Yes. You are a B. Pharmacy graduate, right? Then you must have a basic idea about it? Yeah. Dolo, Zincovit. Those are brand names. Do you know anything about drugs and formulations? That's why I'm here... - Come. - So these are brands and not tablets? Write down the topics that you know. Come. I have had a fever for four days, madam. It's not subsiding. - Did you get your blood tested? - No, madam... Give me that phone. Give. Brother, is mixing 50ml of water with 30ml of alcohol enough? Srinu disagrees. What do you think, brother? Okay. Show me what you have written. I'm on the last line. Ethyl alcohol, Methyl alcohol. Don't you remember anything apart from alcohol? Alcohol is also used in medicines, right? Go to the pharmacy, get these medicines, and explain to her when to take them. Me? Okay. This one is before meals, this one is before sleep, and this one is after sleep. Bye. How can I take it after sleeping? Ask your husband to give it to you. - I'll manage. - Manage somehow... Why are you prescribing medicine to her? Will she be alive tomorrow? - Come. - Hey. By the way, it looks so classy here, but listening to the internal problems each of them has, I am overwhelmed. I think this is the right place for me. I will stay here forever. Stay! What else do you have to do? - Why are you crying? - I failed the exam. Happiness all around! Why are you silent? Even in the morning, you didn't ask me to take off the shirt. This is not our village. We must contain our actions and words to maintain our self-respect. If I get disrespected, will you keep your mouth shut? Won't you spread the word all across the village? Obviously. - Did you see Sahaja? - No. Is she that beautiful? Nothing extraordinary. Forget about her beauty. She appears to come from an aristocratic family and she is educated, yet she exhibits no show-off tendencies, remaining down-to-earth. How? I understood one thing. She is the kind who doesn't make any sound while walking despite having golden chains on her feet. And you are someone who would unbutton your shirt just to show off a five-gram chain around your neck. You two are polar opposites. Forget about her. Are you suppressing your laughter? Let it out. Let's go. Bro, money? Sorry, bro. I forgot. - From now on, track my debt. - What name should I write, brother? - Show! - No. Shaurya. And don't give anything to him. Bro, how's the business? It's not going so well, brother. Yes! I am facing numerous obstacles, brother. Along with all these challenges, the girl also left me, brother. Where is she now? In her village. She married someone else. Not your girl. Where is Sahaja? Over there. She would be in that building. - That building? - Yes, brother. Thanks, brother. Thank you. You have shed many tears since morning. Go to sleep. Uncle. Do you know Sahaja? She studies here. She is fair. Do you know her? She is very overweight but wears revealing clothes. That girl? No, uncle. Every day a new guy drops her off. Is it her? Uncle... What are you talking about? This is supposed to be a dormitory. I have covered everyone. Is she the one? Where? Bye, uncle. Hello. Hi. Sit there. What were you doing there last night? Last night? Yeah. I had a doubt about a medicine. - Really? - Yes. You were supposed to assist Alekhya. Why did you come to me? I felt she was more interested in food than in medicines. I might not learn much from her... Hi! Sahaja, your father is here. That means, my father-in-law. Hi. Come, sit. Oh! Not for me... Hello, brother. Do you have 40,000 rupees? I need to pay my credit card bill. I will return it immediately. I don't have it, brother. I remember a movie, brother. The hero in that movie sells his sperm and earns money. Can you look for something like that for me? I will offer you a commission. Try to arrange something, brother. I'm facing a financial crunch. Even if the whole world is suffering from infertility, still nobody will accept your sperm, brother. You will have it from me! What do you know about me? I can drink a whole bottle without putting it down even once. Do you know that? If I borrow money from someone, I won't repay them until they follow me like a dog. I am a socially responsible person as well. Will you find a better person than me? Try, brother. We can sell it in bulk. Get lost! Don't disturb me! Leave me alone, I am busy. Listen to me, brother. What's up with your friend? - Will my friend's sperm work? - What? Leave me alone. I will go. That's why your girlfriend left you. My girlfriend left me for a different reason. - What is that? - She didn't like my name. What's your name? Atul. - Atul? - Atul? Hey... Hey... She might have been embarrassed to call you in public. - Let's go. - I'm glad you didn't share your last name. We would have been drinking beer and relaxing in our village by now. It's good here too, isn't it? You, me, and Atul... - Hey! - Yes? - Hi. - Who is he? He is someone who can't stand my happiness but is still my friend. Will you have some upma? - No, thanks... - I will. My Dad cooked it. It'll be good. Okay. Oh, if you are from this city, then why do you stay in the dormitory? My home is not in this city. It is 50 km away from here. Her father must have visited here for some work and brought upma with him. Not for some other work, he specifically came here to give me this upma. - Water? - It's okay. He can't come back just for water, can he? Well, my father can't stay without meeting me. That's why he finds some excuse or the other to visit me once every two days. Okay. I have a class. See you tomorrow. Bye. Does your father make puris? - Shut up! I'll return the box tomorrow. - It's too salty. - Let's give it to Atul. - Come. If the body is well-maintained, all the costumes look good on it. Hi, sir. What? 57? Get off. Missed the century by a whisker. Bro, how come your weight is increasing? - Bro, the machine might be faulty. - The machine has no fault, come. - Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi. - Bro, this is football, not Kabaddi. Do you have any doubts? You mentioned wanting to build a hospital after completing your course. Do you have a specific location in mind or are you open to any place? The location doesn't matter. Service remains the same regardless of the place. - Hey, Agadham! - Yeah. It's fixed. There is a vacant 200 square yards space next to our medical shop, right? I'm going to purchase it and construct a hospital. Having a hospital and a medical shop side by side will be fantastic! What happened? Don't cry. If you want, you can start a diagnostic center next to the hospital. Don't cry, there's an advantage to this. You can learn about people's illnesses through their blood reports. So, you'll have complete access to their ill fate! So now I can drink others' blood. - Atul! - Yes, bro. Did you hear this? - Now he is happy. - Come here. Why don't you wear a black saree? Will you be specializing after completing your MBBS? Cardiology. Is it related to the heart? What will you specialize in? Pulmonology. That must be related to teeth. Hey! Hey, didn't I warn you about entering the college premise? Get up and sit in the corner. Get up. He is eating. It's not polite to disturb someone while they're eating. Sit. It's okay. Sit. Okay. Carry on. We made a big mistake by being lenient with them. How dare you answer back to your seniors! We will handle all of you! The issue will unnecessarily get blown out of proportion. Ask Sahaja to apologize to every senior individually. Hari, bring Sahaja here immediately. - This is my fault... - This is a conflict between seniors and juniors, don't involve yourself in it! - Listen to me, Atul... - Brother! Why is he shouting? Is he our Atul? Yes. He is our Atul. Sahaja, Because of you, the entire batch might face consequences. They have asked you to apologize to each senior individually. Please understand. Why do you want to leave college because of this? Let's file a complaint against them. I don't want the whole batch to suffer because of me. No, think about it again... What? What are you doing? Where is the white shirt? Oh, shit! Oh, sorry, are you a boy? Do you have a white shirt? Not the coat, but a shirt. - Bro, do you have a white shirt in size L? - No. Bro, do you have a white shirt in size L? - No. - Oh no, what should I do now? All of this is important. Did you read everything? I need to talk to you for five minutes. Right! Tell. Not here. What? What do you want to talk to me about? I'm organizing my thoughts about the topic, bro. Give me a minute. What? Are you trying to intimidate me? You don't know anything about me or my background. Don't play games with death. Are you still using these dialogues? Oh, sorry! You asked if I'm trying to intimidate you. Here's my answer. Right now, I'm not attempting anything. If I commit to my performance, maybe then you might have... clarity over this body and be convinced. Don't think I'm trying to manipulate you secretly. For example, if the same discussion took place publicly, just for visualization, just once... Did you hear that sound, bro? Everyone is watching and encouraging us. Our energy will double, and we'll have goosebumps. And immediately, our costumes will turn white. It's for you. I wanted to see you in my favorite attire. Bro, you must have your own group, right? Now, thanks to her training, I have a good understanding of medicines. So, after getting thrashed, you'll be given a prescription along with it. One, two, three, go! Give him one Diclofenac, after food, one in the morning, and one at night. Tramadol injection could be a better option, try it. Deriphyllin and Merol, twice a day. Am I correct? Oh, no! Oh, God. Looking at your attitude, you are beyond any prescription. You should be admitted to the hospital right away. If I wear the same white shirt that you wear daily, it will be different. I just want to make two points. Point number, oh sorry! Point number one, I am not as educated as you guys. Sometimes I need to take a break to Google search the words you use in day-to-day conversations. Moving to my character, I am not a good character. In fact, I have a bad character, the worst actually. Despite being such a person, I know how to respect a lady, and it's surprising that you, being so educated, didn't understand that. So, it's useless to fight with you. In fact, it's worse. Point number two, the second reason to avoid a fight with you is... that when I look at you, I see myself. If we get beaten up in front of our own people, can we live a dignified life among them? That's why I didn't beat you even in my visualization. Please understand this. It's okay to live as a slave in a foreign land, but in our own place, we should live like kings. That's why let's not fight. That's what I wanted to explain to you. If you have any doubts or lack clarity about my visualization, open the door, and you will find that reality perfectly matches what I just mentioned. Even Koratala Shiva wouldn't provide more clarity than this. Think about it. Moreover... she wouldn't like it either. Come. Let's go. Let them go to hell. You come. Let's go. - What happened? - What happened? Do you know what he will say? He pleaded with me, bro. I felt sorry for him. You didn't finish lunch, did you? Let's go to the cafeteria. The girl I love is impressed by me! - Can you please stop? - She is giving me hope And I am ecstatic! - Madam, money? - Stop. Starting tomorrow, record all of Madam's expenses in my account. - Stop! - Okay, sir. ...Into a rainbow when I see her My heart won't stop It soars high to touch the clouds It aims to conquer the limitless sky But the entire universe Fits inside my small heart! I am dreaming, but it fades away The reality seems magical, but it is true The world seems smaller to us... We travel hand in hand across the globe My heart aches when we are apart And love grows even stronger When we are together! It was really terrible. Bro, call your friend immediately. Where did he keep the room key? - Hello. - Sahaja. It's me, not Sahaja. Well, "Hello" is the name of Graham Bell's girlfriend. Why would I take someone else's girlfriend's name? I would take my girlfriend's name. Useless fellow! What's this, bro? Why didn't you ask him for the room key? You want the room key, right? Here. I'm in an important meeting. Don't disturb me. Go away. - What kind of person are you? - Did that guy - cut your hand with a knife? - Yes, he actually did. She shines like a bright star for me And she humbly holds my life in her hands Illusion! Illusion! All thoughts are delusional when you're not around Illusion! Illusion! In this vast world, you are mine! I'm accustomed to your company Isn't this love? I am dreaming, but it fades away The reality seems magical, but it is true The world seems smaller to us... We travel hand in hand across the globe My heart aches when we are apart And love grows even stronger When we are together! My heart questions who you are It's true, I know very little about you I don't know when I fell for you Illusion! Illusion! Everything is delusional I was lonely until yesterday Illusion! Illusion! You are mine, I am lost in your eyes I can't seem to survive without you Isn't this love? I am dreaming, but it fades away The reality seems magical, but it is true The world seems smaller to us... We travel hand in hand across the globe My heart aches when we are apart And love grows even stronger When we are together! Daddy agreed to meet you. Don't go like this, wear some decent clothes when you go to meet him. Okay? Oh, wow! By marrying his daughter, I will gain ownership of this house. Sahaja! Oh, a lift! That Agadham will surely be jealous if he sees this. Lord Buddha! Hello. Hello. - Sit. - Yes. What would you like to have? Tea or coffee? Tea, coffee...? I prefer green tea, uncle. Ganesh, let me do it. It's okay. Let me do it. Cinnamon is fine, right? That's my favorite, uncle. Yeah! - Here we go, young man. - Thanks, uncle. So... What happened, Ganesh? Come, sit. Go and do your job. I'll call you when needed. Thank you. What does your father do? He owns a medical store. We earn well. My father has been running that store for the last 20 years with his hard work. From now on, I have to take up that responsibility. Nice. Just give me a minute. Yeah, uncle. Disgusting. Oh, God! I can't... - Yeah. Tell me, dear. - Daddy, did he come? Yes, he came. How is he? He is good. It seems he comes from a respectable family. But ultimately, since you like him, everything looks positive. I think father and daughter are talking about something. But the final decision is yours. I'm okay with it, dear. Alright, he's been waiting. We'll talk once he leaves. Okay. SAHAJA MY FATHER LIKES YOU... Yes! Would you like some more green tea? No, uncle, thank you. What else, son? Not much, uncle. If you could talk to my parents and arrange our marriage as soon as possible, there will be celebrations all across my village. Everyone will be amazed! Where are you from? Rajavaram. Rajavaram? Aren't you from Vizag? No. I came to Vizag for my course. Are you planning to settle here? I mean, do you have any thoughts of settling elsewhere other than your village? No way! I can't even dream of that. If I'm asked to settle elsewhere, I'd rather prefer to die instead. Moreover, if my father finds out about it, just the idea of me not taking up the responsibility of the pharmacy, he would thrash me with my clothes off. No, thank you. If I offer to open a pharmacy shop for you here... No, uncle. Even if you offer me a pharmacy company, I can't come here. My childhood, my strength, and my future lie in my village. The same brand I smoke. - Cigarette? - No... Smoking is not a crime. Yeah. You are correct, uncle. I wanted to ask you, but... Thank you. It won't work. It's working, uncle. Not the lighter, this marriage. You can finish your cigarette and then leave. Uncle, what is the reason? If you don't like me smoking, I'll quit completely. Please tell me what's the problem. It's my problem. I don't owe you any explanation. Uncle! Sir... Instead of answering me, he gave a cryptic response. How strange! Did I dress up for this!? Well, at least I won't quit smoking. Thanks. Hello. Tell me, Shaurya. What's there to say? What happened? Your father is objecting to our marriage. Why? Okay, wait. Let me talk to him. Look, I can say no and not talk about it ever. But that's not the solution. At the same time, it's not right to end it abruptly. That's why I'm telling you with a heavy heart. Before that, tell me something, do you love your hometown? Who doesn't love their hometown, sir? Every man may not have his own home or might not own a plot, but every man has a hometown. What's the first name that comes to your mind when I mention your hometown? Rangabali. Rangabali Center. Do you know... how that center got its name? That's an interesting topic, uncle. This is the best incident of my life that I will never forget. There was a notorious goon named Ranga Reddy. He was killed at that center. His head was chopped off, and it flew across and crashed onto the pole across the street. Blood pooled all around. Too much violence, uncle. Since Ranga Reddy was killed there, that center has been named Rangabali. What else do you know about him? What else... Everybody thinks that he is famous because of his murder. The person you were talking about... is my dad. My father was killed. Setting aside what kind of person he was, I loved my dad. After my father's death, I didn't want to seek revenge and end up in prison, leaving my family on the streets. Neither did he want me to follow in his footsteps. I wanted to continue living in that village... despite what happened to my father. But every day, in one way or another, I would hear the name of that place. - Rangabali Center! - Rangabali Center! I would remember my father every time I heard that name. The killer got arrested, but the name remained. And I couldn't stay in that village with that name etched forever. That's why I ran away from that name and that village. I could overcome that trauma only because... of my daughter. We are each other's only relatives. I dreamed of buying a house near the place where she gets married. Now I can't give you my daughter as I have to go back and stay in that village if I did, and that's not possible. I have better plans in life. You might think it's a silly thing. That center might have just been a name for you, but it's an emotion for me. It will work, uncle. I mean... Not the lighter, but the marriage. Uncle, in my village... Sorry, in our village, the center's name is your problem, right? Let me assure you, I'll change that name. I don't know about your clout when you were in that village, but my clout in my village is huge. Unimaginable! Leave it to me. While you were narrating the story, I was worried whether I would have to change the whole village or its residents, but it's just a name. It's as easy as changing clothes. I'll change it. Don't you worry, uncle. For this matter, don't spoil your health or our relationship. Please, uncle. Sorry. Try to understand. Let me change the name, then I'll take you to your hometown, and your daughter... to her in-law's home with a procession. I'll leave, uncle. I should have worn a dhoti today. The bus has arrived. Come on. Rajavaram has arrived... Get off... Listen, Rajavaram has arrived... Get off... Look, the bus has arrived. - Brother Show, come. - Sir, Rangabali Center. - Rangabali Center. - Come, Brother Show. Rangabali Center! - Brother Show. - Rangabali Center. - Brother Show, come. - Sir. Sir, come. Wait a minute. Are you still at Rangabali Center? The bus has arrived. - Peanuts... - Come fast! Peanuts... Peanuts, sir Just for rupees ten. Just ten rupees for a packet. Peanuts... RANGABALI - Sir, peanuts? - Get lost. Peanuts, sir... Peanuts... Look, colorful balls! Rang-balls! Rang-balls. Look. Let's go. MLA PARASURAM'S PUBLIC MEETING RANGABALI - Can't you see? - What the hell is wrong with your driving? RANGABALI CENTER BUS STOP Move! RANGABALI CENTER BUS STOP RANGA-BALI RANGA-BALI RANGABALI - Hail, Lord Bajarangabali! - Bajarangabali! Hail, Lord Bajarangabali! - Hail, Lord Bajarangabali! - Hail, Lord Bajarangabali! - Hail, Lord Bajarangabali! - Hail, Lord Bajarangabali! What is he doing? He is waging war against an invisible enemy. Why are we being tormented like this? Furthermore, I have a lot of work to do after midnight. He is coming. Ask him. How much longer will you sit like this? It's alright, sit for as long as you want. Hey, be careful. Just like Gurram Center changed to Rangabali Center, why can't we change Rangabali Center to any other center? - It can change. - It can change. Correct. It got its name because of that murder, right? If we were to commit something more violent than that murder, it would automatically get a new name, right? So should we commit two murders? Hey, let's not kill anyone. But it should be very violent. - Should we set off a bomb? - A firecracker bomb? A time bomb! You still can't tell the time properly when asked, and now you want to set off a time bomb? Hey. I am the master of all unpleasant acts. Trust me. I can do it. Dude, if the bomb goes off, people will die and we will get caught. Will you write your name on the bomb? Listen, if the bomb explodes, Rangabali Center's name will change to Bomb Blast Center. - How's the idea? - Excellent! But a bomb... Do you have a better idea? Okay. But we will detonate it when there's nobody around, okay? How will we get the bomb? Oh, God! We need to change our appearance first. Let's do it. Look, how loose they are! That's why I asked for the contract. Do we have to wear this disguise? Our actions should be carried out with utmost dedication. Did you ask why when you were sent to school or college? No. We shalt smite them! I said the bomb is ready. This is the same size as a watermelon. Are you sure it will explode? Should I try once? If we try it here, what will we detonate there? - Correct. - Don't forget, we had to go through all sorts of chaos to get this made. - Don't come near, it might explode. - Then why did you call us? I'll get a bag to secretly carry this. Don't touch. Don't touch! Idiots. Oh, God! Hey, he's running several businesses behind our backs. You are right. Should we check it out? Let's check it out. IF YOU ARE HAPPY, I WILL BE SAD. Oh, God! - He is doing some sort of dark magic. - Yes, I feel the same. It has all our photos. But my photo is missing. Don't get excited, he is preparing your photo. Is that why my nerves are getting itchy? Hey, what are you doing here? Go out! You shouldn't be here. Leave! Hey, what are you doing? Witchcraft? Then what should I do? You guys are tormenting me by getting settled in life. But we are your friends, dude. Although you all are my friends, I still get hurt by your success. What did you say? Nothing, something went in my mouth! Come on, let's go place the bomb. Remove the beard, or the dogs will chase us! Dude, why hasn't your father closed his shop yet? - Did the last bus arrive? - Not yet, dude. Then he will not close until the last bus arrives. Why that fixation? Not a fixation. Do you guys know Venkat Rao? He comes on the last bus and buys his insulin injection. Sometimes he comes late, on those days my Dad waits for him to arrive, meets him, gives him all that he needs, and then closes his shop. Sometimes he comes home at midnight. - And meanwhile, the bomb will explode. - What should I do? He has to come. Hey, Buddi is coming this way. Should I place it now? No, let him go. What are you guys doing here? Nothing. We are placing a bomb in the center. Stop kidding me. Where are you coming from? I just won 5000 rupees in poker. Oh, no! Why don't you come to the center after five minutes? Why? Why have you placed a cell phone on the pumpkin? It's nothing... - Does the phone work? - Oh, no! He pressed the button. The bomb timer went off. - Turn it off, then. - I don't have a Ph.D. in this subject. My job is only to activate the bomb. Deactivating it is another department's responsibility. - Do something! - What can I... If the bomb explodes, it will be called "Agadham Center." Wait a minute, the bus arrived. Why are you walking so calmly? The bomb is about to go off. You're strolling as if you're in a park. Will it explode? The shop is closed! There are still two minutes left. Run! I love doing things like this! A bomb blast spot! - Quick! Place it. - It's placed. - Come on, let's go. - Let's go. Hey! Oh, no! Hey, Agadham, come quickly! I could have been blown to pieces! - Come on, come... - Why did you leave me back there? To get rid of you! - Look ahead! - When will the bomb go off? Exactly in eight seconds. One, two... Breaking news! Bomb blast at Rangabali Center. A bomb exploded at Rangabali Center in Rajavaram last night, but since the blast occurred at night, no one was harmed. Some shops in the center were partially damaged. Who is responsible for this act? Rangabali Center is no stranger to violent incidents. Previously, a murder at Rangabali Center had also created a sensation. CCTV footage related to this explosion can be seen on the screen. BOMB BLAST AT RANGABALI CENTER No lives were lost due to the incident that occurred late at night. The police have confirmed that they are investigating the incident. Hey... I don't care how you do it, but I want this news to be controlled. He may be right for you, but I don't approve of him. Thank you. Furthermore, it's your choice. If you want him, I'll arrange for you to marry him. You can live happily then. But please ask him to stay away from me and the things that influence me. Have you gone crazy? What did I do? Why are you irritating my dad? The moment I told my dad that I like a guy, he immediately thought of getting me married to you without even asking your name. That's the value my father gives to my choices. So I have to respect his choices as well. You don't have to impress him, but at least don't get involved in things that he doesn't like. Alright, this is my final condition. Shubodayam Colony, road number five, house number 89, Gopalapatnam. That's my permanent address. If you want to meet me or marry me, come here. Listen to me... Damn! This didn't work out... Shall we explode a bigger bomb? No need. It exploded violently. Hello. What? A bomb?! Don't ask me about that idiot. Hang up. Everyone is asking me the same thing. I was a partner in crime after all. Uncle, there is a new brand in the market, and we will save 100 rupees per sheet. Should I get two boxes? Uncle, is this mineral water? Listen... you are being cautious about the water you drink, but you are being so careless about the medicines that others will use? If I ever hear such proposals from you, I'll kill you! - Listen to me, uncle... - Useless fellow, take this away! - You don't have a business mind. - Bring that. Hey, come, let's go. We need to get your dialysis done. JACKET WORLD Is my wife's jacket ready? It's half done. Should I give it like that? Ask her to wear the half-sewn jacket. It will be a delight to watch for the onlookers, but you'll look bad. - Should I give it? - No need. Finish it. Go. He is more concerned about the jacket rather than his wife. Did you change the needles? These are Japanese needles. I need not change them for another two to three years. I'm not asking you. I know you won't change the needles. I have spent all my money on him. You'll get sick again in the evening. Come again. Hello! Why do you care? Hang up the call! Everyone is calling me, saying you shouldn't have blasted a bomb at the center. Come on, walk. Hey. Doesn't the center look empty? I mean, should we place some mannequins at the center? It's useless. Because the center has nothing at its center, for instance, we can install a horse mannequin doll in the middle... and arrange a fountain around it. With disco lights at night, if we can arrange an opening ceremony, with posters and banners all around the village, and provide refreshments for all the guests. But this should be done in a grand manner. It would be better if you could invite a celebrity to the event. Slowly, people will start calling it a horse-doll circle. Nice idea. Good idea, but which celebrity will you get for this? - A film star? - Why call anyone else? Show is the celebrity of our village. Bro, you be the chief guest. Shut up! How can he be a celebrity? Don't cry on me. Moreover, it won't look nice if we are the chief guest for our event. It will be like we are honoring ourselves. Then who shall we bring? Useless build-up! Look, what is it? I'll take care of it. You go. Hey, you could have drunk it. People are craving a drop of it. It's okay, brother. How come you are getting younger by the day? Stop it, bro. What's up? Why are they standing outside? Couldn't you invite them in? Brother... we don't like you giving so much importance to Show. Is the camera ready? Bro, this time's campaigning should also be a hit, okay? We shall rock it, brother. Bro... - Give the photos to him later. - Okay, brother. - Come in. - Yes. Brother... I came here to ask you a favor. We have organized a function at the center. You must definitely come. Also, since you spoke about campaigning, think of it as a part of it. Sure, bro. Kill me if I don't keep my word. But you must surely come. You must keep your word. You can kill me if I don't. Thanks, brother. Inform Ramu... about the meeting time and date. Sure! Bye, brother. I have invited the MLA for an inauguration. Once the center's name changes, I'll also change your surname. - That's it. - Are you not serious about anything? My father won't come to that village, - and you... - If it sounds repetitive, let me say it again, I'm going to change the name and take your father to his hometown and you to your in-law's home. Please trust me. I'm getting late for class. I'm doing all this for you. Can't you give me a kiss or a hug in return? Watch your nonchalant attitude. Hey... Hey! Okay, go. I have my imagination. Oh love, go ahead, let's begin A treasure of beauty Is this true? Love is unshakeable Let's rediscover it My heart cries, is the love venomous? The beats of this heart Running away are thunderous My wet lips have his name all over them Are you being hasty in blaming me? Are you looking at me With suspicious looks? Bloody love, won't leave me alone This elegant mess! I am the hopeful sun The sun won't rise at night, would it? I'm the greatest warrior Nothing is more fatal Than an arrow in the heart The light can be stopped from illuminating But time can never be stopped from moving You and I are distances apart Let's find solace in each other's hug Oh love, go ahead, let's begin A treasure of beauty Is this true? Love is unshakeable A treasure of beauty Oh love, go ahead I heard you got the funeral catering contract too. What is the status? He is eating everything, dude. - Hey, Agadham! - Yes. Come here. - Okay, what are the curries? - Brother? - Bro, tea... - Eggplant and peas. - Drumsticks and lentils. - And fry? Potato fry. One more thing, don't open the Shamiana before the MLA is done with his speech. - Okay. - Come. - Come on, quick. - Get them out! Bloody beggars, you are always the first when it comes to food. - Ask them to come out. - Out. - Come out. - Move! Go! Pick up the pace. Give us two minutes. Hey, come on! Brother, we shall stay here and get in as soon as they open the tent. Okay. What is the function about? The elections are near, so Show and the MLA would have planned something. What is this box for? To pack some lentil soup. Oh, God! Remind him to revise his speech. Or should I prompt him? - It's okay. I'll take care of it. - Okay, come fast. Hey, where's the garland? A WARM WELCOME TO THE MLA WHO WILL UNVEIL THE HORSE STATUE. - Long live... - Mr. MLA! - Long live... - Mr. MLA! - Long live... - Mr. MLA! - Long live... - Mr. MLA! I'm giving you two minutes. If I find that horse statue at the center or those people around it, I'll kill you all. Okay, sir. Clear everything along with the horse statue. Greetings. WELCOME MLA PARASURAM FROM SHOW ASSOCIATION Come fast. - Brother, what happened? - I'll take care of it. - Brother, what happened? - Where are you going? What's happening, bro? Why have I organized this function? The center seemed very vacant. So we thought we would make it attractive by installing a horse statue. - Get me two chairs and two cups of tea. - Okay, sir. What is the name of this center, bro? Brother? Rangabali Center. Do you know the origin of that name? Because Ranga Reddy was killed here. Not the victim. Do you know who killed Ranga Reddy? My father. You might know him. My father is a street goon, bro. We literally stayed on the platform and ate leftover rice. But the moment he killed him, he instantly became famous. Politics came around, he started from being a party member and rose in ranks to become an MLA. After him, I became MLA. The root cause of all this... is my father... beheading him at the center. My family's success started from this center, bro. This center is sentimental for us. It's our identity. Not just that, at least 100 people visit this village every day, and at least one of them would ask this question, "What does Rangabali Center mean?" And to that question, the answer would be, "Once upon a time, Kaikala Basavaraju beheaded a rowdy named Ranga Reddy," celebrating the greatness of my dad. As long as the name remains, people will always be talking about me... and my family in some form or the other. Now, if you come in with your horse and donkey dolls, how will I accept it, bro? MLA PARASURAM WELCOME Can't I install anything? If I did, the name of the center would be affected, that's why I've left it vacant. Previously, when you blew a bomb in the center, do you know why the entire matter became silent within a day? So that it doesn't impact the name. Cable, why is there so much commotion around them when they are casually talking to each other? Hey, don't remove that! Keep it as it is! Put it. Put the garland. Let's not spoil our relationship. Don't meddle with the center ever. Everyone can wear a white shirt, but one must know his limits too. Smile! Smile, man. Smile. YOUR FUTURE IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TEAM PARASURAM - Greetings, brother. - Greetings. Come in. - Are you fine? - Yes, sir. Get out. The MLA is asking you to leave, right? Leave. We have some personal topics to talk about. You must be aware of what's happening in the town... and who's calling for a meeting, right? Yes, sir. You should be aware, right? I should be aware, sir. You should be aware of it. Yes, sir. He had informed us. He did? He informed you?! Did he?! He informed you?! - Why did you agree to it? - Move! - Hey, move! - You should have known better! Stop! - We can't work with you, sir. - Get out! Why are you standing like a bull? Give me the way. Get lost! We don't need to work for him. We can find some other job. - Let's go. - Let's go, brother. We have seen people - Greetings, Brother Show. - fighting for girls or property, - MLA sent this for you. - but he is fighting for a name! - Cheers! - Take it, brother. Why did you spill it? When you have such a costly brand, - why should we drink cheap brand liquor? - Correct! Pour it. Pour it. - Hey! - Dude, that's a costly brand! Hey, pour it! He wasted the entire bottle. I threw my drink for this? What, Show? How's the brand? It burns. Did you have it without any mixers? Okay. Forget about whatever happened this morning. You know that MLA likes you. Didn't he go overboard? Lighting the mannequin on fire and all that rant about the history. - I didn't like it at all. - Pour me some. Okay. He has his reasons. He expressed his feelings about that name, that's it, right? It didn't sound like that. It felt more like a warning. What's in a name? He acts as if he owns the center. Is he even necessary for its opening? Don't we know anyone else? If I make a call, the opposition leader will come running to the spot. Remember that. Let it be anyone. If he acts smart in front of me, I'll kick him! Wait, I'm getting a call. The person you are calling has put your call on hold. Please wait while the call is connected. Hello? Hello? Okay, I'll call you later. Hello... Your call is on hold. Hold the line or call back after some time. The person you are speaking with... - Where are you? - In the hostel. Where are you? Me? Rangabali Center... - Get down! - Hey! Are you...? - Bye! - Sahaja, please listen to me. Call on hold. On hold... Don't you listen to your patients patiently? So please listen to me too. Please, Sahaja. Running away from the problem is never a solution. Your dad did the same thing. But my dad is getting hurt because of your actions. - On hold... - Hang up! - On hold... - Hang up the phone! Hold... When we make a call, people would put the other person on hold and receive our call with fear, but he is putting us on hold. But he is not at fault. I should have told him in a way that he would understand me. Okay. This time I won't hurt him. Please trust me. Try to understand. If I can't... then I'll leave this village and come to you. Promise! Okay, bye. Smile, please. Bye. RAJAVARAM RANGABALI CENTER BUS STOP Hey, there's a fight happening there. - Fight? Where? - Come with me. Mr. Viswam! Greetings. People come to Mr. Viswam's medical with enormous trust. -And you have given us -I can't believe that you did this. expired medicines. Have you been giving everyone expired medicines all these years? I purchased a headache-relieving drug from this shop, is it okay? If something happens to the little ones, both you and your shop will turn into dust. There are many ways to earn money. You need not stoop to this level! He gave her expired pills. - They are taking her to the hospital. - We must have overlooked it. What a sinful guy! He is selling expired medicines and risking people's lives. Are you so careless about people's lives? SRI SHAURYA MEDICAL & GENERAL STORES Even God won't forgive you! People like you should be taught a lesson. Son, don't. Don't! Take him inside. He should be careful while giving medicines to kids. I will never come to this shop again. We didn't think he was like this. Is it necessary to sell expired medicines for money? Give way. Move! The MLA has promised to bear all the expenses and take care of the girl. - Go now. Go, do your work. - Move aside. - Hey, get out of here! Go! - They don't have any work! Don't you guys have any job to do? - Will the kid survive? - Get lost! Poor thing. He does not give the wrong medicine. We don't know how it happened. What happened, bro? I heard there was a quarrel that happened at the shop. I didn't like the sight of you picking up tablets on the road. I heard you say, what's there in the name? Why is he creating a scene over a name after all? Your medical shop has earned a name for itself, right? Now, earn that back, and then you'll understand that... if the brand image is lost, it's very hard to earn it back. What will your father do? Send him to me. I'll give him a job. Okay? Bye. Son, stay at the shop for an hour. I'll come back. Where are you going, Dad? I want to check on the girl's well-being. My friends are with her family. She is alright now. I'll drop you at home and pay her a visit personally. Home? Why? Let's go, Dad. If required, we shall come back later. SRI SHAURYA MEDICAL & GENERAL STORES Mom? - Where's Dad? - He has gone to the shop. Take a bath and come quickly. I'll serve you breakfast. Dad, your lunch. No customer has visited the shop yet, bro. Eat something. No need for an injection. I came to give you your 50 rupees back. It's okay. Did you eat anything? I started this shop when you were five years old. Since then, it has supported me financially and made the whole village my family. Every morning, the first urge would be to open the shop and sit at the counter. I wouldn't feel alone until then. I never considered it a business. Rather, I considered it a responsibility. But today, I sat idly at the counter... I couldn't. I would rather starve than be jobless. Not giving medicines to people felt like... I was choking with pain. Let it go, Dad. Things will normalize soon. No, Son. Once an accusation is made, no matter what you do, it won't leave you. On top of that, these people... they would forget all our good deeds... and service for the last 20 or 30 years and would give prominence to that small blame made by a third person after all these years. They forget our good nature and character... and spread rumors about us all around them. This is the true nature of society! We are regressive! Okay, you leave for Vizag. Looking at the situation, it feels better that you settle elsewhere. Give me a couple of days, I'll arrange some money and deposit it in your account. Dad? Listen to me. Leave as soon as you can. Since my childhood, I have seen him at the shop more than I've seen him at home. He loves that shop so much. Instead of being a support to him... He was happily doing his work. I dragged him onto the road because of my selfishness. Will you leave the village like your dad said? Do you think I'll go?! Not when he is in this situation. I'm not leaving the village, no matter what. This is my birthplace. This is my home until death. I won't leave, no matter what. I won't leave. Sahaja, I'm not in the mood. I'll talk to you later. How long will you avoid me? With each passing day, I'm losing trust in you. Okay, listen. Just as you're concerned about your father, I have a father here too, and I care about him just like you do. Let me make it clear that I can't leave this village. I'm not going anywhere. This was my last call. - Bye. - You stay there, and I'll stay here. Do as you wish. Goodbye. RANGABALI CENTER This one name has ruined my life. Who is this Ranga Reddy? The murder took place 25 years ago. If you want to know the details about it, only Shivayya, who runs a soda shop on the outskirts of the village, near the highway, can help you. Let's go. What do you want? I need to talk to you. Talk to me? - What is it? - Who is Ranga Reddy? How did he die? Aren't you the son of Viswam, the owner of the medical shop? Yes. I am. Now tell me. Why do you want to know about him after all these years? He is dead, but he has had a huge impact on my life. Tell me, sir. How did he die? He is not going to tell. Come, let's ask his son. One minute. Do you know his son? Yes. I know. Tell me. Who is he? If you find out about him, you might not use derogatory words for him. If a man cares about himself... then it is an ordinary life. But if a man agonizes for the well-being of people around him, that is Ranga Reddy's life. A six-foot-tall man. Sharp eyes. He was someone who would oppose the wrong no matter who is on the opposite side. He lived for the welfare of his community. Whenever a family is in trouble, the first address they seek is Ranga Reddy's. But that day... - Hello, sir. - Sir. They are asking us to vacate the shops at the Gurram Center. Why are you telling this to me? How can I get involved in every petty matter? Approach the court if you want. You are our voice, sir. It's difficult. I can't. I can't help you. You may leave. Sir, we are dependent on those shops. We have come this far with faith in him. - What? Approach the courts? - Why did he say that? Don't we know that? We unnecessarily came to him. Ranga... you are always worried about their welfare. But today you refused to help them. What happened to you? Whenever people are in trouble, if a man comes to their rescue, they would forget to fight. Every time they are in trouble, they would expect him to help them. If one person stands as a shield to the people, then it is not their strength but their weakness. When problems arise, people should learn to face them... rather than wait for someone to solve them. Come, let's go. To where? Let's greet the MLA. Let's go. It'll take 20 days to vacate all the shops. One lakh per shop is a fair deal. Meanwhile, you arrange the cash. Who is it? What is this, Guru? You can't tolerate this harmless smoke? Then if you keep a factory in the middle of the town, how can people tolerate that smoke? Ranga Reddy... please stay away from this matter. Take whatever you want. Get up. If you want, take the seat of ZP Chairman. I came here to talk about people's problems... and not to sit and gossip with you. A total of 140 shops, if they vacate this, where will they go? We will build a complex for them on the outskirts. On the outskirts? So if someone has a medical emergency, they must run to the outskirts, should they? What about the financial condition of these people until you build the complex? They will have to manage until then. Let me make it clear to you. Do not interfere with the shops at the Gurram Center. Do not meddle with their livelihoods. Do not open your factory and trouble others. Forget about this idea. This is my humble request. Ranga Reddy, you don't know the value of the chair. Standing at the beach, if you think that the whole sea is at your feet, you are wrong. It may engulf you in one go. Just because I came to negotiate with you, if you undermine me and raise your voice against me, be sure, I will certainly kill you. Look, Guru, I don't know how to threaten, and I didn't come here to threaten either. I just told the truth. Sir, people are approaching the court. Brother, the people are approaching the court. Tell the people that you are not planning a factory. - Sir. - Sir... PRAJA KRISHI PARTY - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. - Sir... - Greetings, sir. I thought that the opening of a factory would provide employment to my people, but I'm also concerned about the pollution that you all will have to face. That's why I fought with the government to cancel the factory plans. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. He was offering me 25 crores as a commission. It was enough to fund the next four elections. As long as he is in this village, he will keep on pestering me. If people find out about his activities, he will be unstoppable. We must stop him somehow. Okay, brother. Twist your mustaches after dealing with him. If I find you being haughty again, I'll shave them off. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. We have arranged an offering to our Goddess. - You are welcome to that program. - Sure. I will. Thank you, sir. - We shall take our leave. - Greetings, sir. - Happy birthday to you. - Happy birthday to you. - Happy birthday... - Happy birthday to Nani. Look at the gift your father gave you for your birthday. Look. Hey, a cycle! - You can ride it tomorrow. - It's okay. Let him go. Hey! But Ranga... SARADA TIFFIN CENTER - Shivayya... - Yes, Ranga! you leave. I'll come. Take Sahaja along with you. - What happened? - Leave. Okay. Sahaja, let's go home. Grandpa will be back. Do not hesitate. Come forward! GURRAM BOMMA CENTER - RAJAVARAM He sacrificed himself... to save you. These people... when the person who always wished for their well-being died, forgot all the good things he had done for them... but remembered his death as Rangabali. They forget our good nature and character... and spread rumors about us all around them. This is the true nature of society! These people made the person who killed Ranga Reddy an MLA. Now they have made his son an MLA too. These people! Even those who survived because of his sacrifice, don't know about him. All his works have been focused on the welfare of people... but he never let people know about this. What is this? Why is he coming here? Hey, why is he always hovering around here? He's running away with his tail between his legs. I don't like your name. Not at all! Who is it? Who is it? Let me tell you my story in short. I loved a girl, but her father told me his sad tale and rejected me. What should I do? Okay, I was still trying to manage things on my own and resolve the problem. But none of my ideas worked. Next, I came to you for help, but you told me your own story and asked me to leave. Where should I go? He is telling his story, you are telling me your story, I felt like a side character in both of your stories. But today I realized that... the whole story is mine, and the entire conflict is mine. Listen carefully to what I'm saying, I'm deeply connected to that man. If I could do anything worthwhile in my life... it would be to restore his pride. Have no doubt! You may antagonize me, fight with me, or do whatever you wish to, but I will certainly change the name of that center. I won't call you brother anymore. Parasuram! Parasuram! Okay, Parasuram? Greetings, sir. It appears that Show has planned something significant, sir. He has called for a meeting of all the villagers. The elections are very close, and I am afraid he might harm our chances. What should we do? We must take some action against him. He is not an ordinary character... I told you not to gather them. I knew that this is a bad idea because people don't have the patience to listen to the good. Show has asked me to cover the entire program. - What program? - Has it begun? Not the one you play at midnight. This has to do with the public's welfare. - The meeting is... - Sit down now! - Got it? - Oh, God! A good program? Who will be interested in it? My Siti Cable rating will go down. I have other things to do. I'll leave. Hey... Someday, we must play his program on his cable network. Now we've come to talk about the good deeds that a person has done for us. Come. Hey, where are you going? He was fine until yesterday. Why is he suddenly talking about welfare? He is talking for your benefit. Wait for ten more minutes. The program will be done. Do you think we don't have any other work? Greetings to you all... I'm going to tell you about an incident that happened 22 years ago. I am going to tell you about a man. His name is... - Ranga Reddy. - Hey! The lassie is here... Everyone, go home and get dressed in your lungis, and come back soon. Wait! Wait, everyone. This is for your benefit. Listen to him. Aren't you tired of your wife? - Come... - Didn't I tell you? -Just because you understand, -Come, let's go. don't think that the people will understand too. Leave it. Let me tell you what I received At which centers and on which days Let me tell you who all gifted me And what they gifted me Now I'm at the Rangabali Center It's crazy scenes over here Tell me who is giving How much to me? Now I'm at the Rangabali Center It's crazy scenes over here Tell me who is giving How much to me? What did you get At Devi Chowk Center? I got the keys to an Audi car Oh dear, what did they gift you At the Gandhi Center? They gifted me a Brandy store When I entered the Bangla Center And they gifted me a golden statue As heavy as me! In the Leelamahal Center Rammanaiah came to me and Gave me an entire layout In the Koneru Center Kottaiah came to me and Gifted me assets worth crores Now I'm at the Rangabali Center It's crazy scenes over here Tell me who is giving How much to me? Now I'm at the Rangabali Center It's crazy scenes over here Tell me who is giving How much to me? Hey! An atrocious act took place in Rajavaram. A young man named "Show" brutally stabbed a ruling party MLA on the road. Why did he stab?! What happened between Kaikala Parasuram and Show, who have been like brothers for so many years? Why did they fight with each other? I have become an insomniac. Can you please tell me why he stabbed him? I'm really confused, please find the details and tell us. I was about to marry him in the next four days, but he stabbed the MLA. We demand a CBI inquiry into this incident. We don't know why he stabbed him either. We are very puzzled. Let's ask our reporter on the ground, Express, and find out the reason behind the stabbing. Sandhya, we are right in the center of the village. Let's ask the villagers if they know the reason for the stabbing. My name is Pukaar. I am the only source for all the villagers for any news or gossip. - I am a bachelor and still a virgin. - Hey, stop the camera. Who cares if you are a virgin or not? Idiot! Show, why did you stab him? I don't know anything about it. - Sir, why did he do it? - Bro, they are torturing me. We don't know why he stabbed him. Do you know why he stabbed him? - No, sir. - No. Sandhya, they don't know either. People are going crazy over why Show stabbed the MLA, and you, ladies, are busy with your shopping? I am thrilled to see people going crazy over this topic. How crazy would it be if there was a blast at this time! Look, mister, do you know why Show stabbed the MLA? He is an idiot, sir. He not only stabbed the MLA, but he betrayed me too. Nothing, Sandhya. He detonated a bomb for him but then left him alone and stabbed the MLA. Over to you, Sandhya! Hey, how do you know? -One guy is stabbing people with a knife, -Sir... - another guy is detonating bombs... - I don't know anything... Sir, I don't know anything. Sandhya, give me your number, and let's leave. He is like a God to us. - Our MLA was like our God. - Hey, who are you guys? But outside the hospital, people are... - Why did he stab you? - expressing their grief for their beloved MLA. Where is Ramu? We don't know why he stabbed me. But release a press note... saying that he is in critical condition. It will generate sympathy for us. - How is the MLA now? - The MLA's condition is critical. Please cooperate with us. Mr. Driver, do you know why he stabbed him? Contact Sai Baba Water Supply at 9848870082. - Please, sir. Leave me, sir. - Sir, please. - Let me finish the jacket. - Sir! Dude, why did you stab him? People are going crazy without an answer to this question. We have got in touch with the PA of the MLA. He dressed quite sharply but looks sad. Let's ask him for more details about this. Sir, come this way. Sir, tell me what happened. He is not in a condition to take his favorite drug... Breaking news, Sandhya! - The MLA is a drug addict... - Medicines! He is not in a condition - to take his medicines. - Oh, I see. I am so happy to see him behind bars, but I'm scared that he will stab me if I laugh. What did you do? - We detonated a bomb. - We detonated a bomb. - Bomb? - But you pressed the trigger. Terrorist activities and Sedition case. You might face capital punishment. They'll kill us?! Dude, I didn't finish the jacket yet. They are going to kill us, and you are concerned about your jacket? This is our opportunity. If we recruit Show to our party, our party would get free promotion. Well said. - Come! - Let's go! Just give out a statement that the MLA asked you to stab him to gain sympathy votes, - and we will offer you an MLA ticket. - Sir, why did you stab the MLA? What is the reason behind the attack on the MLA? Please tell us, sir. Sir, tell us. RANGA REDDY Who is Ranga Reddy? What is the link between Ranga Reddy and the MLA getting stabbed by Show? Let's hear what Pukaar has to say about this. Tell me, sir. Rajavaram... Hey, move... Did you notice this, Sandhya? The people of Rajavaram are avoiding speaking the truth. Over to the Studio. Sandhya, can you hear me? Please don't call out my name so many times, Express. - Just cover the news. - Okay, Sandhya. He is the reason for all the people in the center to have a livelihood. Then why do people not know about such a great man? Why did you make a person who killed such a great man an MLA? One minute. We don't want him. We don't want that MLA. We don't want that MLA. Made a mistake by asking my relatives and friends to vote for him. He treats us like animals. He thrashed me with bamboo, here, right here. The pain was unbearable! The MLA must face capital punishment if you want us to live here peacefully. The MLA did many wrongdoings. He falsely accused Mr.Viswam of treachery. - Hail, Ranga Reddy! - Hail, Ranga Reddy! LONG LIVE RANGA REDDY - MLA... - Down, down! We are now at the Rajavaram police station. MLA DOWN! DOWN! Sir, tell us why you stabbed the MLA? Answer us, sir. - Hello, sir. Answer us. - Bro, you are amazing. - Why did you stab him? - You deserve a Padma Shri, bro. - Do you even know what it is? Get lost! - Brother! Brother, why did you stab him? Brother, why did you stab him? I would've convinced my father somehow. Why did you do this? I don't understand this. - Move! - Shaurya! - Shaurya! - Long live, Brother Show! Sir, why did you stab the MLA? Please answer us. Sir, please answer us. - Hey! My lungi! - Long live, Brother Show! - Long live... - Brother Show! COURT BUILDING COMPLEX - RAJAVARAM Can you remove my handcuffs? It's okay. Even if I escape, they'll catch me. - Long live... - Brother Show! - Long live... - Brother Show! I thought a lot about... how I can make you understand this. Well, I asked my local cable network provider that, I needed to broadcast something good, but he refused. But as soon as I stabbed a man, the whole state media gathered here. Brother Show, why did you stab him? Wait! Let me finish! My congratulations to the media and the people... for the attention and encouragement you give to violence and evil. Why did I stab the MLA? A small word before I tell you what the link between Ranga Reddy and this issue is. Even a child in our village knows that the name of the center... became Rangabali Center after the murder of Ranga Reddy. But nobody knows that it is because of him that there are so many shops at the center and so many families are still living off it. Even if somebody knows, he will not speak about it because what he has done is a good deed! People like Mr. Viswam, who shuts his shop only after giving medicines to the last person who comes on the last bus, also don't garner any loyalty. This is the greatness of our town! You know what kind of people there are in our town. Mahatma Gandhi once said don't listen to evil, but there would be someone who would only listen to evil. Gandhi said, "Don't gaze upon violence," but one would come on a bike to witness violence. Gandhi said don't speak evil, but there would be someone who would do no other work other than speaking evil. We need such people around us, don't we? Especially people like me who stabbed someone... and are honored with garlands for it and giving a speech on it, people like you who stopped all your work to encourage me and listen to this interesting topic in such a hot sun, people like you who have come to cover the news with great creativity, people like the opposition leader who gives me an MLA ticket for being a criminal, people like us should live here! Isn't it? Because of this, we are increasing the evil in tomorrow's society by multifold! Madam, you... Yes, you! You have been standing in the sun for a long time. Later when your children ask you when you go home, "Where did you go, Mother?" Instead of telling them that one person stabbed another, so I ran to see him. It would be better to say that I went to learn about a man who did good for our village, wouldn't it? What do you say? So let's change at least from today. Let's stop rallying behind evil, violence, and especially people like me who are utterly useless, and let's talk about good people. Let's change. Let's forget the evil that took away Ranga's life and talk about the good that Ranga had done for us. Let's change the Rangabali Center to Ranga-Bhale Center. - Rangabhale! - Rangabhale! - Rangabhale! - Rangabhale! - Rangabhale! - Rangabhale! RANGABHALE - Rangabhale! - Rangabhale! - Brother... - Rangabhale! - you didn't tell me why you stabbed him. - Rangabhale! What did I just say? You said, let's talk about the good and forget the bad. Isn't stabbing bad? So let's not talk about it. - Sandhya! - Rangabhale! - Rangabhale! - Rangabhale! - Sandhya! - Rangabhale! - Rangabhale! - Rangabhale! RANGABALI CENTER BUS STOP Rangabhale Center! RANGABHALE CENTER BUS STOP Come on, get in. Get in. Rangabhale Center! - Excuse me... - Sir! Why is the center named Rangabhale Center? There was a great man named Ranga Reddy. He has done many good things for our village. That's why that name. Rangabhale Center! Breaking news! The court has sentenced Show to six months of imprisonment for stabbing the MLA. Now coming to the topic of Rangabali Center, - the good work that Ranga Reddy has done... - Hey, he got punished... What about us? - Capital punishment! - Hey! Mr. SI, before we are hanged, do we get our last wish? - When will we be asked? - Shut up! I was about to ask for alcohol. I might die without sewing Sathyavati's jacket. Give it to me. I'll wear it. Have patience. I'll give everyone their medicines. Who dares to stop us in our village!? Hit them!
