Thanks, partner. - You've got anything? - She hasn't been dead too long. Two days, maybe. - What about her work? - I can't tell. Anything else? Okay. Okay. Hi, Charlie Bronski. Hi, kid. Call Morgan. - Bumper Morgan? - Yeah. I've got a guess that she might have been a hooker. You're right. Her name is Millie Haskins. Some people used to call her bunny, I never know why. Now, all those names are people that knew her in one way or another. Millie moved around quite a bit. Maybe she was shot and thrown upon those bridges up there? No, she'd been busted up a lot more than she is and that's the way it happened. Now, wait a minute, Morgan. Let's check this. Roughly 28 years old, partially clothed, no purse, no jewelry. Several facial and bodily bruises. And discovered 07:48 a.m. this date. - Is that about it? - Right. See you. Morning, Your Honor. I can't. I'm all muddy. Don't change the subject! I told you right from the start... that you don't even exciting, we have nothing in common, not one thing on this Earth. So would I'd like to know Officer Morgan that just... What the hell are you doing in my bedroom? I could've changed at the station but I got a hot tip that I could get some help here. I don't know what you're talking about. But supposing I say that you can't. Have to search the neighborhood for another apartment... with a nice lady and an ironing board. Are you here to use me or my ironing board? Hey, wait a minute. Mud...you said something about muddy. Oh...okay. Come here. Hey. Cassie? You called? I don't know how I was ever lucky enough to meet you. Or why you have anything to do with me. But I'm glad. See that man? That's a policeman. He’ll come and get and put you in jail if you’re bad. That's really clever, lady. Make him scared of the law. Then he’ll grow up to hate cops... because you scared him to death. I'm not a cop lover, Bumper, but I... Hardly anybody is. - What's happening, Frankie? - Nothing's happening. Heard you got your feet wet this morning. Sounded kinda hairy with the ropes and all. You know, some guys are real freaks when it comes to broads. Works both ways. - Wrong street. - How's that, sheriff? I said you're on the wrong street. I don't want you catching any squares in a coin smack on my beat. Now, move out! If I see you around here again I'll send you down there right where your money went. Hello, Bumper. Hello, Harry. How's the betting business? Betting business? I just wrote my mother a nice long letter. Well, she ought to be real proud of you... the way you know how to use the United States Mails. Well, for her the sun rises and sets on me, Morgan. I'm sorry if I inconvenienced you... because of your mother. Here he is. The finest cop money could buy. Bumper is here. Get busy! Hey, Bumper. That Millie Haskins on the news this morning. Now, is that the same Millie used to come in here and drink coffee all the time? Yeah. Awful. The same kinda thing happened last month in the Valley. Beat up, tie up, shouter. I remember reading about it. - Scrambled eggs and lachs? - And a bagel. The usual! Bumper Morgan? - Yeah. - I am glad to know you. Parker...Avery Parker. Nice to meet you. Somehow I think you'd be a bigger man. I am. Oh... He sure is, Mr. Parker. Couple of years ago he jumped three bums who are tried to jump on me. I call him my hero, don't I? I've just opened my offices in the Roxman Building. Diamonds, all the arts. Fine watches, fine rings. Why don't you stop around for a special discount? Thank you. - Well, the thump, you. - I'm would. Hold it! Hold it! All right, Noodles. Get over there on the sidewalk, will you? - You alright? - Yeah, I think. - Need an ambulance? - No. You get that thing out of here. - You almost got yourself killed, Noodles. - What's the difference? I don't mind about you. I just don't want a heart attack on my beat. 1-X-L-40-5's requesting a B-wagon on the Fifth and Main. - Now, your right name is Craig Milton, ha? - Negative. Craig Millard. Two L's. I ain't that drunk, am I? - No but you're dying. - No crime in that. That's not pass the law. Eyes bloodshot, gait staggering... Condition stuporous, resident transient. Period. - Thanks. - Well... You left out the most important part. Unable to care for himself. Check. Check. You see that meathead there? Just made a buy. He's wearing long sleeves to cover the hype marks. God knows what he's got in his pockets. He just got out of the joint. I can spot those cardboard shoes from here. I tell you something. If I'd go over there and make a pinch... and we went before judge... be case dismissed. Insufficient probable cause. Stopping the searching and pertaining. Just flag the wagon down when it shows up, ha? - I'm arresting myself again, ha? - That's right. Thanks. - Does Alice is in? - Yes, she's in. - Hey, she's somethin' else than the others. - Really? Especially in the mornin'. Alice's got this thing about daywork. - Let's go. - Just a minute, bum. - Where are you from, man? - Libya. Well, I never heard of that but I think you better get yourself a locker and key. - I don't want no trouble. - I guess that suit you, dude. Alice's fine, you know. But she's a stone thief, man. She clean you out if she gives the chance. - You got a safe here? - Yes, man. Right over there. Why don't you leave your wallett with the desk clerk here? He put it in safe. Okay? - I don't want no trouble. - Give it to him, man. Be safe. All this. Give this in. Be safe, man. Now, can I have my five dollars now, please? And five for the desk clerk here. And three for the room. Be safe, man. Go right up to the 237. I'll buzz Alice. She'll be there about two minutes. Hey, bum... I don't know how they do it over there in Libya... but you're in for a whole "Lucia". Yes, yes. Yeah and don't you work too hard. Work easy, baby. Don't work too hard. You know it yourself. Work easy, man. Work easy. Freeze! - Where you come from? - Down the chimney. Now, both of you over there on the floor. Face down, spread-eagle. Face down! Is anything wrong? I'm trying to stop you from being flimflammed, sucker. Now, get your clothes on! Look out! Get up to that telephone. Call the operator, tell him to get the police. And that an officer needs assistance at the Bixby Hotel at Wall and Winston. Bixby Hotel, officer needs assistance, Wall and Winston. Yes, sir. Now, what will you going to do with this? - You're going in this car here. - Are you going with me, right? No, I got a lot of paperwork to do. Oh, Officer...Thanks. Look... My father and I have a very fine restaurant. Please, I want you to come and meet my father and... Be my guest for a very fine meal, okay? He's handy with an ashtray once he gets the picture. It's okay, mamacita. All in one piece. You know how many times I wake up in the night sweating over you? Seeing you trying to duke it out with a couple like this, getting your head bashed in. It could happen, you know, like it almost happened now. We're getting too old for this kind of stuff. Too old. Did you ever think about retirement? Sure, Cruz. Every time you bring it up. Alright, alright, alright. The fan-belt. The lousy fan-belt that keeps coming off. - Move it! - Go on around! There's plenty of room. Thanks. All fixed now. Happens all the time. All fixed now. I know how to fix good. All fixed. In the car now. We go. Okay, we can go further. Get in the car. Come on, everybody in the car. We go. - Wait a minute. - What for, Officer? There is no problem here. No problem at all. Gypsy boy. I'm just a gypsy boy. My babies, the mother of my babies. We go now, ha? What are you doing in this part of town? Shopping. Just a little shopping, that's all. Just a little shopping. No harm in that. Any packages in there? We didn't see nothin' we liked. We ain't got much money. You can see that... - What's your name? - Ben Marcos. Driver's licence? Sure. I don't do nothing against the law. There is no problem here, Officer. You know I'm just a gypsy boy. You know me, don't you, Officer? I talked with you before, ain't I? You know we've talked before. You used to work downtown with a dame on a pigeon drop. Occasionally it's you're makin' switch. Well, I just wanna tell you... You not gonna have much luck around here. We can go now, Officer? It's very hot for the mother of my babies in the car. Please, sir, can we go now? Yeah, go on. All right, we can get the ice cream now. That’s telling him, Blinky. Hey, are you guys got the hog road last night? We got him all right. We combed the whole place and the car. Yeah but he's been busted three times or four in seven days. - Sounds like he has a library card. - Come on. - Hi, Bumper. - Hi, Morgan. Hello, Morgan. Are you made those reports on that? No, we went some place to get hamburger. Kids. - Well, well, it's still there. - What? Well, that thing in the middle of the dashboard. What do they call that? A radio? Do you mind try tuning it in? Do you mind try listen to it and every once in a while... handle some of the calls that come in? Cruz, you're beginning to sound like a sergeant. I am your sergeant and don't forget it. Anybody else would have your horns trimmed by now. Why? Because some of the guys in the district... are complaining that they're handling the calls... because you're off the radio walking around so much. - What guys? - Bradley, McKegg, Serriany, want me to go on with them? Look at them. They wouldn't know a snake in the grass if it jumped up and bit them on the nose. Every one of them came out the Academy like you Bumper, like me, every last one of them. They're babies, mano. Only because they haven't been out yet long enough. - Charlie. - Be seeing you, Cruz. Morgan. - Find yourself a killer yet? - Not yet. I've been sorting out all those names you gave me. Running down every one of them. But weren't yet any idea that Millie Haskins work for a guy or not. You gonna have to ask around, Sergeant. I'm not ask around. I'm asking you. The pimp just money got out of that last date. Does usually work that way. Pimps don't get the dates. They just take the money. Have you some kind of hang about cooperating with homicide, Morgan? No. Why? Because somebody shot Millie Haskins three times with a 38. We all know she had to ask some kind of contact to meet the guy. You keep on working around with no stopping for twenty years. If you're getting around or across somebody you think... I have to know, you call me, okay? Sure. Thanks. Boy oh boy! You really have a wing disposition. What do you got against this guy? He doesn't know his rear end from a burnt biscuit either. He's only one of the best man in the department. And there's nothing you can do because he's fifteen years younger. Just keep the radio on and stay on the air. Okay, Cruz. But I never made a good pinch yet from a radio call. All the good bust come from walking and talking and looking on the beat. Walking and talking and looking on the beat... and the next thing you know you're not doing police work anymore. You're just some kind of character out there. - Well, somebody's got to do it! - You don't! You've been out too long already. You would've been a captain... if it wasn't for that lousy beat. It's nothing but a "puta". Can't love you back. It can only use your laugh at you. And you've been on that beat for twenty years. By the end of the month... you can pull the pin. Vacation time... could be offered by Friday forever. You can't love on that beat. And you listen to your friend, Cruz. Your soul's in danger if you don't love. Hear and watch your "mano". Come on. The problem is that the left was unwilling to come to agree these conceptions. In earlier times the contest between radical and conservative and liberal... was more clearly delineated. Those on the left like Rousseau... were prepared to assert that manners's basically good. Or like John Stuart Mill that it's essentially rational. Or like Thomas Jefferson who... was capable of ordering his own and society's destiny. Now, the left still holds to this outlook. Even though...in spite of plans and proposals to... remedy the maladies our time. Alcoholism slips through. We'll stop on that and pick it up tomorrow. - So you're cutting out of us. - Oh, yes. Going on the faculty at Bainbridge next year... so I have to go to San Francisco and case dismissed. Mr. Richard will be taking over for me. Go on now. Beat it. I'll say my goodbye some other time. You are going to be a hard egg to follow, Cass. Final exam. She'd never breeze. You don't want to forget the whole thing and stick around and marry me or something? No. You already have a wife and I almost have a husband. Did you ever notice they get to park anyplace they want to? If we do it we get a ticket. Old Dick Tracy had a farm... E-I-E-I-O. I'm going to hit the gym first thing in the morning. And I'll be there to drink you a long long goodbye It's not that far away. - Hey! - Hi. Hi. What long goodbye? Well, for my going away. Seven o'clock tonight for students and faculty. - You are invited. - Thank you. Hello! What have you been doing? Making the streets safe for women and babies. - I'm retiring. - Maybe we ought to lock the door. - Hey, what did you say? - I'm retiring. Oh... - Cruz got to you. - Yep. Well... - You never could look him in the eye. - Well, I can now. I'm leaving Friday and time to go to San Francisco with you and time to marry you. Can you just do that? Not can. I'm going to. You sure you can leave it? I'm not married to the beat, Cassie. Lock that damn door. Officer. These people are bothering me. Get lost! Hey, I see you took the training wheels off. Yeah, a long time ago. Big handsome fella like you ought to try to get an honest job. Did you ever think about joining the Police Department? Yeah, I did. I was afraid I might get a partner like you. Yeah but I have to teach you not to walk around my beat with those boots on. You'll be kicking up sparks and starting fires. 1-X-L-40-5, 1-X-L-40-5, call 1-4-2-4. 1-4-2-4. 1-X-L-40-5, roger. 1-X-L-40-5, roger. Some other people I've been talking to telling that Millie had a pretty big habit. Big enough. Those are the funniest looking hype marks I've ever seen. They're holes. She got them in a joint about two-three years ago. Up there they kind of improvise. They use a lightbulb filament and they heat it with matches... drop a hole in it with a needle and stretch it out. Then they attach it to a plastic spray ball. Millie told me all about it and now I told you. We get off it now. We don't like each other too much, do we, Morgan? Did you find your pimp yet? I look for a guy name Zoot Lafferty. - Zoot Lafferty... - Can't seem to get a line on him. - Do you know where he's these days? - No. - Anything else? - Yeah. Did you ever bust her? No, I never did. Never had the chance. Well, let's just put it this way. Every now and then Millie Haskins assisted me... in my official duties as a Los Angeles policeman. For small fee, of course. She was one of my snitches. I don't know how he played these things, Charlie, but... I never bust a snitch if I can help it. 1-X-L-40-5 code six. Six on Wall. What's this all about? This is Dr. Haskins. Officer Morgan, doctor. How do you do? I'm Mildred's father. Mildred Haskins. Dr. Haskins came to claim the body. - We wait for you in the car, sir. - Thank you. You're the man of father? Yes, sir. I'm father. - What can I do for you, doctor? - Would I be wrong assuming that you knew Mildred? No, sir. I knew her. I thought I knew her one time. I guess I never did. She was a prostitute, wasn't she? - I really don't know, sir. - You do know. Let me explain something. When I leave you I have to go to my wife... and tell her that Mildred is dead. Mrs. Haskins is not a well woman. And prosaic is it may sound. She has kept a life buried into herself all these years. What about yourself, doctor? I loved Mildred more than I can say. When you see her mother... you tell her that Millie... I mean Mildred... was the victim of a street crime... and that the Police Department is doing everything in his power... to find out who committed it. But don't tell her anything else. Of course I'll do that. They say that man proposes and God disposes. I get very little comfort out of those words myself. Considering you bring a child into the world. You love her. You educate her. You see her change from a child to a woman. Then one day a man from the coroners office calls... and tells you it's all over. None of it worked. It doesn't make much sense, does it? No, sir. It doesn't. Thank you. - Oh, no. - Oh, yes. - Oh, no. Not this time. - Oh, yes. Yes, this time. Oh, no. Beautiful people, Marvin. Just beautiful. - You're looking good these days, Roxie. - Thank you. I'm sure. - What's your name, son? - Stanley Daberough. - New playmate? - Yes...as a matter of fact. Gorgeous. I smell pig. You look bit off your beat, aren't you, Harry? Look, I'm moved clear over just to get away from you and your beat. How much action you got bitten down today? - Other time, Harry. - You would like if I'm gone. Oh, I'll go. Marvin here likes your business. Marvin. Why don't you break down to buy Officer Morgan a little drink? I wouldn't buy Officer Morgan a glass of slop! Now, when do you stop comin' in here and rousing my customers, Morgan? I said I smell pig. Never I can get Mr. Rovitch out of my mind. Marvin and I go back a long way, don't we, Marvin? You see, little Sam Rovitch got behind in some interest payments... to a guy by the name of Stapleton. Marvin here did the job for him. Used leather gloves with wrist pins on the palms on Sam. Poor guy like that. You know, his bones never did heal and he finally died. Marvin's a big man now. Doesn't have to do jobs like that anymore. Course he's sore at me 'cause I... closed this place down twice. Got his licence suspended. That was sixty days a piece, wasn't it, Marvin? You know somethin'? Now I really do smell a lot of pig in here. I heard you the other times too, son. What's the matter with you, Morgan? You're a psycho, Morgan! You shouldn't allow them to get so drunk. I'm not drunk and you know it. Ah, you had to be drunk to say those things. - I'm taking you in. - These people will testify. I'll sue you for false arrest! Take your best shot. There isn't one of these slimeballs that it'll give you a break time of the day... if they had a crate full of alarm clocks. Now, Marvin! You better get out of my way... or I'm liable to get the crazy idea you're trying to interfere with my arrest. Morgan! Morgan! I'm gonna have you dropped! You just might to hang a target on your back. Are you prepared to swear before God that I was drunk in there? No God on this beat, son. Suppose you know the Supreme Court decision on cops to go around... Well, that doesn't work down here either. - Hi, Grogan. - How are you doin', Bumper? You see, I'm forced to write my own decisions. And you just violated one of my laws. Which is contempt of cop. You can't hold me in and you know it. I'll be out in an hour. Yeah but you gonna have to ride around this thing for a couple hours. Might just change your mind. Take up your short, dog. I'm sorry, Officer. I didn't do anything. Go on. Hey, come out of there! Come on out! I'm not gonna bite you. Hi, Bumper. How's your parole going, Arthur? Good as gold. A month of program...Hey! You're on a program, ha? I'm not the strongest individual in the world, Bumper. You're not gonna bust me for a lousy marks case, are you? The whole Union Pacific Railroad could run on those tracks. - Come on. - I couldn't spend the night in jail, Bumper. I'd have to kill myself. I know you got a hole on new snitches. But I roll over anybody for you if you just give me a break. Except your best connection. That's God you've just introduced in the conversation, Bumper. I may not bust you, Arthur, if you can do me some help. We're talking about a tootsie named Millie Haskins. She had big habit. But she's dead now. They killed her. Now, she just might have used your connection. I'll ask for you. I'll ask. But, see, my connections got tender doorbell. - Maybe I can get someone else... - Arthur. I'm gonna be fifty years old in two weeks... and I'm starting celebrate my birthday right now. I'm not interested in any two or three lid punk. Oh, no! This is big. This is... Oh, this is real big. This guy did me bad once and I wouldn't mind pop on him. There's only one thing: don't get me ratchet. You see if he thinks I fink and he slips acid in my spoon and... he laughs while I splash. You work with me. Nobody knows. Nobody. Okay. I'll bring this guy and another guy. This course of week. When he unloads cargo to the guy. So cargo's out and he gets some friends. And when they spend the whole afternoon after meal in a hotel... Get on with it, Arthur. He's up there and the dealer down. He's a big man. His name is Marvin Heywood and he runs... Arthur, I know all about Marvin and the Pink Dragon. And he's the kind of a guy that's got to be set up! I said Marvin. Yeah, I said Marvin. It's no good, Arthur. You just haven't got the equipment these days... to handle a guy like Marvin. He'd see through you like a hole in the sock. Bumper, I'm in awful shape today. You understand? I'm gonna find something for you. Something good. I swear I will. But you just got to help me. You would give me...? Get out of here. Sign it here, here and here. On all three copies. Full name. Use a permanent mailing address. And be sure your appointment date is accurate. All right? One copy goes to the captain, one copy goes to personnel... and the third copy goes to yourself. Here is your book with all the retirement and benefit information. Be sure to look it over carefully. Bumper, old pal. I laid a lot of money with big odds that they'll have to carry you out. Kicking, still holding on to the radiator. Hey! If I've run into you... you can be a witness to my last official act. Like to tell the chief what he can do with that thing. - Got an ID? - ID? Aren't you gonna congratulate me? As of today I'm a private citizen. Congratulations. - How does it feel? - How does it feel? It feels great. It's a rotten job and I was begin to feel rotten with it. You learn too much in the streets. Changes the way of thinking, the way of feel. Okay. Beautiful. Well, good luck, kid. I leave you to the high-flyers, the flimflammers. All those funny fellas with their long jackknifes. I start a new job tomorrow. See you. They think I'll never make the best while I can. Nope but they might find the town dirty enough for it. Come here. I missed you. Really missed you. They got to put you back on nights. - Well, how's business? - My business is always good. Do you hear about Millie H.? Beautiful, ha? Not very. Who did it? Some kinky freak who likes to savage a broad. Well, we got a town full of those. Believe me, I know. Scary. Maybe one of those bustle bumpers out there. Did you know Millie came to me once tried to get a job dancing? I told her to go out and find some guy and get married. Instead she went out and found Zoot Lafferty. That creep! You vice guys ought to pick him up and put him away. Kills woman. No, he uses them. He led some killing himself. - Have you seen him around? - No. I don't know where he is these days. I'd like to talk to him. I've always wanted to ask you something. - Is this come out of your own pocket? - It's my own. You've been a cop all these years and you still don't know you can't save this rotten world. I'm not trying to, Glenda. I just love the battle. Ask a little bit, will you? Every dollar you've ever given me is gone into a bank account for Sissy. I'd go ape to find it never. There's nothing like having a kid on your own. I know. Mine would have been 26 years old by now. With Mutton Chop sideburns and a lot of long hair. Possibly. You ever hear from your wife? Not in fifteen years. Never seen my exes either. Not that I want to. You and Sissy... are the only ones. You are what's happening, baby. Do you mind not doing that? - What? This? - Yeah. Okay? You know what? You're beginning to be a real character. You're not even look like a cop right now. Next thing I know you'd be taken those bums out of jail instead of put them in. Got enough time. I haven't, Glenda. I'm retiring. From everything. - When? - Friday. Then you won't go out with a big shine on your badge. Something like that. You'll never quit the street. You can't get away. You'll be in till they kick you out or till you die. Just like me. Yeah. Hey, Bumper. I fill this out and mail it back to you from San Francisco. You can have my badge and ID card before I leave. With Cassie? Damn, how I glad for you, mano! Even though you don't believe in God. I believe in the gods, Cruz, you know that. When you're gonna learn that there's only one God? Even your God's got three faces. Morgan, that crazy chili picker's trying to dance with you? He's gonna pull the pin, Lieutenant. My twentieth's up to the end of the month. Right. And by stringing my vacation days together I can be through on Friday. Right. - Cups. - Right. Yes, sir. He can get a security job for a lot more money than he's getting here. I'll be damned. Who invented that stuff? I don't know, Bumper. Why? I'd like to bust him. Then the chairman is promised city council action by Friday of this week. Well, we'll see what happens with that. Los Angeles Police Department homicide officers are investigating... the brutal murder of Mildred "Bunny" Haskins... whose body was discovered yesterday morning. They're pondering the possibility that she was victimized by the same unknown assaulter... who beat and shot to death a young Northwich housewife last month. According to investigators that assault... - Harry. - Comin' up. ...resemblance with the circumstances of the Millie Haskins case. And turn that thing off, will you? One buck. I wish Irma get here. She's late! Yeah? Who's she? A goofy barmaid I hired last week. She’d steal your eyes right out your head if you let her. But, oh, does she have a crazy, great body. A beaut. God, I wish she were here right now. I just love to look at her. But all I can do these things. If she looks that good I'd like to look at her too. You're not gonna take her away from me, are you, Bumper? 'Course not, Harry. Make it you pay for a drink, huh, Bumper? I don't know. He's forgetting a lot lately. Last week he forgot to lock up twice. Yeah, just walked away. I don't know how long he's gonna be able to run this joint. You know what really makes my flesh crawl? The way you getting old is happening to hit. I mean a mile a minute. This crazy old cook is starting to die and he doesn't even know it. I'm gonna tell you something, Freddie. Do you know why I do all my drinking in this place? Because the conversation is always so cheerful. Hey, Bumper. I guess everybody runs from a man when he starts to die. - Hi. Irma? - Hi. See you all later. Oh, I thought you would've chicken out. Not me. - We are celebrating what? - Us. Us...yeah. - Well I...stopped on the way. - I tell Cruz. Oh, you wouldn't do that. - Oh, this is Sheela. - Hi, Sheela. And this is Mr. Morgan. No it's not. This is sheriff John. - Right on. - Where is your uniform? I guess I forgot it. Well, some people feel those uniforms are a little comical on you. I feel the same way sometimes. Come on. Ah, scotch on the rocks. Our host: Dr. Demond's with our history department. - And Mr. Morgan... - He's with our Police Department. - Really? - True. - Must be very interesting work. - Aha. Well... - Have a ball. - Thank you. You know, before you charge into my life... I used to love waddling around with a gang of kids like these. You never waddled in your life. But now nothing seems the same. Good for you. Hey, we have a thousand things to plan between now and Friday. Well, I'm sort of planing on planing later. - Your place or mine? - Yours. Don't beat around the bush. Champagne? Police discount of course. You're gonna miss all those police discounts. I don't think I'm losing a discount. I think I'm gaining a wife. You're my Blue Knight in a black-and-white charger... and you joust and live off the land. - Try roust. - Roust. Better. You think you gonna be able to handle me on a full time basis? I'm sure gonna try. Be careful, huh? - Scotch? - Fair exchange. You're not one of those unnatural pseudoprofessionals... that look through people, are you? No, sir. Right into the baby browns every time. Somebody we just can't get mad? Neighborhood cop. Not even a secret weapon. - Refreshing. - Thank you. - What do you patrol? - Neighborhood. How do you feel about street demonstrations? Oh, I like a little demonstration now and then. - How about pot? - Got any? - I mean how do you feel about it? - Bad. - Why? - It's a depressant. - But it's harmless. - Not the way I see it. It... It brings out the beast in us too quick. I prefer this. I noticed. Why would anyone want to be a cop? I'm not putting you on. I really wanna know. Really? Really. Well, believe it or not... In life there are certain things that mama's not gonna do for you... and papa's not gonna do for you... and sure as hell teachers not gonna do for you. And somebody's got to do them. - Do you really get satisfaction when you put a man away for ten years? - Sometimes. Wouldn't you wanna do something for the people rather than to them? I think I'm doing something for people every time I make a good bust. Why? Well, there are some people that can't afford to be victims. Who are you planning to bust tomorrow? The guy who murdered Millie Haskins. Who's Millie Haskins? A junkie, a hooker. But she's got her rights too. - What do you? Social science, major? - Hardly. - English? - Wrong. I'm a law student. Someday I expect to be your adversary in a courtroom. Can't win them all. - Where do you know all those cops? - Century City. - Were you there? - Yeah, me and the president of the United States. With your white helmet and your nightstick and your gun. Well, I needed them all, bastard. You didn't see any needless brutality? No, just about 5000 screaming people. I was wrong. You're not like every other cop. You're worse. Now you're going to get roust tomorrow because of me? Anything you said to them or they said to you doesn't matter to me. Look, for twenty years you've been doing a job for a lot of people... who don't cheers to appreciate it. I'll be so glad when you get that uniform off for good. You'll beginning a has-been, you know that? I know what I'll beginning. What do you want? Your phone. Have you gone crazy? Have you gone crazy? Do you know what I can do to you for this? I think we'll just keep this thing between the two of us tonight. You don't have any witnesses. Neither did Sam Rovitch and neither did I... when I got your little message tonight. You're in the same boat as me. Nobody around. I never did think you could take it. Oh, there's one other little thing, Marvin. You're not gonna see me on this beat after Friday. So before you're going to the john get yourself cleaned up... you better call your pals. And tell them they're as good as dead... if they ever get within five miles of me. All right, guys. Hold it. Break it up. Get that line up! Keep halt! The old man is seeming a little bit in a wrong meat this morning. So I advise anybody if you got a ham sandwich or banana in your rare pocket... get rid of it! Keep halt! I can make an announcement right now, Bumper. I'd rather you didn't, sir. Okay. - Sir. - Oh, yeah. Homicide has asked me to have you familiarize yourself with this Haskins case. We're looking for a guy that likes to beat 'em before he kills 'em. No description. If you're getting any information that looks like a lead you call... Sergeant Charles Bronski. Extension 4022. That's all. Dismissed! I don't know. I still think that you should let the lieutenant make the announcement. I don't want any announcement. I just want to fade away. I'll take my regular two days off... and when I don't show up on Monday, there'll be that. - Why keep it a secret? - Because I'm secretive. Well, he had an inspection for you to make the announcement. I don't want any announcement. I just wanna go. You think if they don't make the announcement I won't go? Yeah... Well, maybe. Can't the guys are trying to make any coppers these days? Never check to see what the prisoners might have stashed. Someday I'm gonna find a kilo of hash, a hand grenade... or I might even find a dead horse. What the hell is it with you, Cruz? Get those eyes off me. I don't want anything to go wrong with you, mano. Nothing's gonna go wrong. I'm just spending my time saying goodbye to my friends and my enemies. Would you say goodbye to Glenda? Well, I did sort of. Why? I don't know. She called, left an address. Said you'll understand. Here are your fare. - Grogan. - Hey, Bumper. It...comes with the work here. See, if you've got a lot of catswipers around here and... What the hell is it you up? What are you here to swag? One of your fancy tenants, maybe. I've got a tip he use in 713. Look, if... If you plan on rousting the guy, try to hold on the noise because we don't like a lot of noise around here. Ah, you there...Grogan! Yeah, that punk is my boss. Well, let's have dinner some night, huh? Yeah, yeah. What night? - Well, you like arab food? - Love it. - How about tonight? - Good. - Right here about 7 o'clock, huh? - Yeah. You're on. See you. This isn't your beat. No more beat after Friday, Zoot. I didn't want to go without saying goodbye. Now open up! Middle of the month... Taken the day off to catch up with some bills. Last time I saw you, you didn't have a pot or a window. The last time as I recall you had quite a bit of fun arresting me. Would you care for something? Tell me about Millie Haskins. Now, just start anywhere and I sort it out later. I heard about it, of course. I'm terribly shaking. At one time we had some fine times together, Millie and myself. Some really fine times. Let's start with the name of the guy or the guys that she was with that last night. I can't help you. Millie had a wrong contacts lately. That's a croak. No. That is not a croak. That is the truth. Millie and I parted the company several months ago. Why? She became unreliable. Blew a little jealous of the other cows. Girls... Frankly she was grooved out most of the time. Zonked. And she began taken things. My things. Selling them for horse. When was the last time you talk to her? Two or three months ago. It's just before I went to Europe on a little vacation. She was working at the Round Table. She came down so far even that place was out of her class. It's pitiful. I...I felt sorry for her. I really did. I bet. You should remember that when you started her out. Now, that's unfair! Unfair! Let me make something perfectly clear to you. I don't go after a girl. A girl comes to me. Her own choice. You're an old man. You ought to start acting like one. - Now, get out of my home! - Just one little second, Zoot. Hey, you have no right to search this place! I didn't have to search it. It was right here in front of me. What are you trying to do? Go out sergeant before you walk the plank? There's a homicide dick downtown who wants to talk to you. Homicide or narcotics? Mainly homicide did they. Come on! Mr. Lafferty here is decided to give himself up. I haven't done anything. Well, let's just say that Mr. Lafferty is a good citizen and he's come down here... to cooperate with the Police Department and in the investigation of the homicide. You're the rottenest creep I know. Now, after you cooperate with Sergeant Bronski here... you can go back to your slimy business. And I give you my word on never roust you again. That is not personally. 'Course I can't guarantee that some other cop won't shag you sometime. I'll set up for you'll never rousting me anymore. I can't stand to be rousted. Sit tight, Zoot. I want to talk to you a minute. Diaz. Take the handcuffs off him, will you? - How far did you go with him? - He's got a little persecution complex. I want information out that bum, Morgan. I don't want them so tight and so mad and so... He's a scum and he has been one all of his life. He's fractured every law in the book. Now, you wanted him here and got him. I brought him in. What else do you want? What do you want Morgan? I wanna leave here Friday with a piece of this bust if it goes down. Are you pulling the pin? Yeah. Hey. - Are you going to give me a ticket? - Not really. If you are there must be something I can do to change your mind. About seven o'clock tonight. Up there. You can get... food, drink, aid, comfort... and some other stuff. - Sounds good. - Oh, it's good. I think I just bribed a cop. I think you did, too. - This has expired. - I'll be waiting for you. Oh, Cassie. I'm sorry I forgot, I've got to have dinner with a guy tonight. Well, then come over afterwards. Yes but it may be late. I want to see you tonight. Okay. Now, give me my ticket. I'll be late for class. I think I've forgotten how to write one. Bumper... I want a boy. There. I said it. You sure did. Cassie... I hadn't thought about having a family. Now think about it. In ten or fifteen years... you and I gonna be old. And we've got to think about it. Two years ago Nancy Vogler and her husband in our history department... Hey, you look funny. Are you listening to me? Yeah, every word. Well, they took a boy into their home. He's fifteen years old now. - They adopted him? - No, no. They became foster parents. She said... She said they almost missed out on knowing what living is... until they got that boy. Bumper... A white, black, brown, yellow, parti-coloured. Well, I don't care. But there must be a lot of them around who needs someone to... look up to and to learn from. And when you and I... We have someone for both of us when we were old. Better get this renewed. 1-X-L-40-5 1-X-L-40-5 1-X-L-40-5, go. Meet the plainclothes officer at the southeast corner of Beverly and Vermont. This call was approved by your watch commander. I didn't like the way you brought Zoot Lafferty in, Morgan. We both know that's no case on possesion of narcotics, don't we? Anyway I just took Zoot home. He told me a hell of lot more than he thinks he did. Seem to some girls specialised to handling the kind of freaks... we're looking for. I'm gonna be talking all of them that we can find. Or Zoot's gonna tell me a lot more before I'm finished with him. In the meantime, Morgan, I want you to stay away from him. I'm gonna handle him my way. And I don't want any interference. Is that clear? I don't know what you're bucking for. Maybe you want to be captain or chief of police... or some junk job like that. But if that's what you want, Charlie. You better start thinking yourself... that the guys like me out on the street are making you look good... by keeping barfbags like Zoot... from taking over the town. Anything else? I'm sorry. I played it wrong, lady. - I beg you pardon? - Other five seconds he would've grabbed that... and I'd had him. - How did you know? - It's no scum in this neighborhood. You sit on the porch like you live there and then you run out and grab a purse. He's probably on the next street into his car by now. Why don't you get him? Because he didn't do anything. But you did. Wearing your purse like that. - You know this neighborhood, huh? - Yes. Well, next time leave your bag at home. Carry your lipstick in your pocket... and tuck your money right in there. - Can you remember what I told you? - I think so. You take a lot of worries of my mind if you do what I told you. I will. And I'm terribly grateful there's an officer like you on the street. Thank you. Stop the pull, Harry. Just give me the ID. - All right. Where is it? - Where is what? Knobby, how long you know this punk? This guy? I don't know him. - I don't believe you. - I don't care what you believe, Bumper. Now, the way I see it... You had your choice: the mailbox or this joint. I had the mailbox covered so you took this joint. No action today, ha? You better lock up, Knobby. You're going in with im. For what? Further investigation. You just sit here and drink your coffee. I don't know him. I really don't know him. He has been in my place a couple of times and we've talked about. That's all. 1-X-L-40-5. Damn it, Bumper! I'm not gonna let you push me around. Knobby, you're not gonna give me any trouble, are you? 1-X-L-40-5, come in. 1-X-L-40-5 request any unit in the area for transportation at 375 East second. Bumper... I've got certain other things. Now, I can't afford to take time off and go down and wait to get rid it out. You know I don't work with him. I swear I talked to the guy... - I want a good one, Knobby. - What? I want a good bust this week. - This week? - By Friday. He's a punk. I want something bigger. I want something with hair on it. Wait a minute! There is this girl I know. She told me she turned a trick... - Sorry, no hookers. - Now, wait a minute. The guy she was with was packing a piece. Under the pillow. - She told me. - 38? - I don't know. - When did happen? - Last night. - What's the guy's name? What he look like? - Where? - I don't know. But I can find out. He goes to vice. I'll be with you in a minute. Make your call and make it quick. What have you got, hon? What else? That's sounds okay. I'm on the 907 number. Can you get it? Good. Okay, I'll... Wait. I'll be through here in just a minute, Officer. I'm expecting a call right back. Is it some emergency? I hope you wait for your call, Laila. Police officers aren't supposed to smoke in public. Oh, this is just shock uniform that I've rented to an underground movie. It self-destructs when I press a button. Okay. What is it? A roust? What's the case on me? You're having a conversation with a loser. L-O-...Whatever it is. I just don't have it. If I were taking calls full time would I've been taken them in a public telephone booth? It's just one little question about a trick you turned with a guy. Oh, Bumpy, you are kidding! No, I'm not. No, you're not. Okay. What guy? 70 years old whose wife's been dead for two years? He likes to watch me take off my shoes? Or was it a sixteen years old who cried and ran? How about yourself? You could have fun. I could have fun. If you don't like me I've got some terrific friends. Wild. Are we all finished? Yeah we are all finished and we never even got started. Because I just gotta tell you one schlub looks just like another to me. This schlub might have looked a little different. Got a gun under his pillow. - Timmy. - Timmy who? - How would I know? - What's he look like? Male, caucasian, 5'10", 170. Sandy hair. Thinning here and here. Raunchy dressed. I'm good, eh? Any scars, conversations, phone calls? He mentioned any friends? I went in and I scramed out fast. He was one I didn't want to get to know too well. He was a freak. Oh? A way-out pervert. One of those guys who gets the kicks pretending to tie you up... and whip you with a cloth belt. Usually it's a fake-out. Timmy boy was a real article on the perverse kick. When he pulled out the clothesline I knew it was a bad trip. You happy? Okay? Your phone's ringing. Hello? 'Course I remember Paul van Chack. How's Paul? Thank you very much. But maybe the next time you're in town, hmm? No, I just love Paul. I'd love to meet you too. You're such a nice boys. But at the moment I... But I'm very busy right now. I'm having a very nice chat with a very nice man. Actually he's more of a cop. A big-footed, fat... That's the way you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else? Most of them. - Did you meet Timmy that way? - Yes. - Did he phone you here? - No, I have another number. - Let's have it. - What for? For me. Now, do you happen to remember where you met him? The Orchid Hotel. - What room? - 313. I hope you two get along fine. You're more his type. - Who are you? - Elmer Johnston, sir. - I work here. - Good for you. - I want an extra key for room 313. - 313... - Mr. Landry is in his room right now, sir. - Whose with Mr. Landry? No one, sir. No one. Well, just give me the key then. - You can just knock on his door. - Come on, come on. Give me the key. I'm afraid, sir, I just...I...I... - I want to see every register for this hotel for the last five years. - Sir? I wanna know what kind of customers are using this writing academy. Come on, Elmer. Half these rooms are rented four times a night. Is anything wrong, sir? No, sir. Freeze it! Stay right there! All right, now turn around! Elmer, come in here and make yourself useful. Yes, sir. Read that to him. Admonition of rights. Just get down to number one. Number one: "You have the right to remain silent." Two: "If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law." Three: "You have the right to speak with an attorney... and to have the attorney present during questioning." Four: "If you so desire or you can't afford one... an attorney will be appointed for you in charge before questioning." "Do you understand each of these rights I have explained to you?" - Answer him, stupid! - Yeah. "Do you wish to give up the right to remain silent?" No. "Do you wish to give up the right to speak to an attorney... and have him present during questioning?" No. Now, is that just about cover all his rights as the citizen of the United States of America? Every one of them, sir. All right. Let's go. Hey, mano! Howard tells me that you turned over a possible murder suspect. His name is Tim Landry. Now, this guy is just kinky enough... - to be the freak that killed Millie Haskins. - Yeah? We're holding him on a low-grade felony. Ex-convict, gun... But he's got all the right credentials. Two years ago he served time for nearly malling some dame to death in Hollywood. And he fits to description of the guy that was seen with Millie that last night. The way you got homicide all worked up. - Has the PO place the hold on him yet? - No. Thanks, Frank. Scum's got a rabbit foot in his pocket. Finished parole two weeks ago. How would you like to work with homicide on this? - Me? - You. What can I do? I'm a patrol officer. Charlie Bronski asked for you. - Charlie? - That's right, mano. Cruz, Charlie and me don't get along too good. Well, isn't about the time you started? After all you are talking to people that you know and he doesn't know at all. It will save time. It will help him. I spoke to the lieutenant already. - Yeah? - He said go right ahead. It's all police work, homicide or not. Charlie will see you about an hour. Oh, miss! Will you kindly tell me what you meant this morning about that... "Better get it renewed" stuff? Oh, Cassie, I didn't mean to have it come out like that... Well, that's how it came out. Made me feel like a kid with bad skin. You think maybe you just hide behind that thing every once in a while? Let's not get into that, Cassie. We've got everything worked out. We've got nothing worked out. Tickets. Our plane leaves tomorrow night at seven o'clock. And while you're having the best dinner you've ever had in San Francisco... we will decide where and when we're gonna be married. Now, on Saturday and Sunday we got a real estate agent... and then find us a place to live. You better hold on to these. And future-former Officer Morgan just may get himself a classy recommendation... before he walks distant. Now, look... I've got a lot of police work to do so... I'll tell you all about it tonight, huh? Before or after dinner? Cassie, I've still got this police work... Okay, okay. Just thought you might get cancel it or something. We'll spend the rest of our lives together. You just wait until I get you tonight. After your important dinner. We do a lot better when there aren't a couple of thousand people hanging around. Gee, the fuzz. Why don't you get yourself some new material? Okay, gentlemen. Let's just move it right in here and line up with me. That's it. Move it right in and line up. Okay, hold it right there. Okay, gentlemen. Let's give us a little turn around to the left. That's good. Number four man. Would you trying watch what the other people are doing and try to stay with them? That's good. Number six man. You wanna take the hat off? It's that okay for you, Charlie? Let's see them in a red, John. Fred! Ladies and gentlemen. If you recognise any of these gentlemen up here, don't indicate it anyway but... tell the investigating officer quietly. You're looking good, Celia. He's a gentleman that man. I just love him. How about it, Celia? You recognise any of those guys? Yeah. That one is a vice cop. Busted me three years ago. Try it again. When we ask you where you live, we want the address of the last place you slept. Is him or me going to play "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe" or something? Celia... Couple of nights ago you worked in Round Table Bar with Millie Haskins. And she left with a john. Now, this is important. The last guy... the last guy you saw her with... Now, is he up there? Tell us where you live. I can't see the back of the room. If he's up there I don't see him. But I've got to tell you I was so stoned that night... Millie could've walked out carrying a full grown elephant... I wouldn't still have seen her. Celia, as you might go on upstairs. Damian wants to get a little more information. Man, you've tied me up long enough. But you tell the man I got to have my rest. Celia's got to have a rest. As a matter of fact you can stretch out on his desk upstairs. - Right, Charlie? - Yeah, sure... Make yourself at home, Celia. I'm glad I've got you behind me on this thing, Morgan. - I thought she'd peg him for us. - Me too. - Can you hear me all right in there? - Yeah. Where do you come from? Where do you live? Today if we...we crack this thing... You're gonna be on it all the way. - Where do you live? - Bay View, Oregon. When we ask where you live we want the address of the last place you slept. Okay, Ambrose. Where do you live? I don't remember. Some fleabag down to Alameda. What have you been doing when you were arrested? I was having a beer with a friend. And what was his name? His name? Miriam Murphy. All right, all right. Let's terminate all the hilarity there. Step back. Hold it, gentlemen. You want to hear anything more, Lily? No, not from those clowns. Do you recognise anybody at all? No. Okay, Lily. Thank you. You can go. There was another girl... This is Mr. Sights from the D.A.'s office. Officer Morgan. Sergeant Bronski. Morgan. Bronski. Mr. Sights. Mr. Sights tells me he has just joined the D.A.'s staff. Yes, I'm handling the Kerrigan case. The John B. Kerrigan. I believe you arrested him three months ago...robbery suspect. I remember, sort of. - Yes. Well, that's why I'm here. - I see. This is Mr. Sights's first case. Morgan, may have a moment with you, please? Well, when is this come up in court? Two o'clock in division 34. You were notified, weren't you? Yeah...yeah, I forgot. Well, look, Mr. Sights. If you just take a seat back there I'll be right with you, ha? So the girl's name was Gloria Fastess, Forstess...something like that. She used to work in the Round Table too. Frank, get Gloria Fasten down here, will you? Fasten, that's right. What's with him? Is he trying to start a movement? You know how it is? He's young. Be nice! Go back there and hold his hand a little bit. How is it going? Landry's gun didn't kill Millie Haskins, Cruz. Yeah but it doesn't mean that he couldn't have used another gun. I know. - He really pulling the pin? - Yeah, tomorrow. Beaumont, Texas. Hands out the pockets. - I forget. - Stand in attention, please. - Just like if you're in the army, huh? - I wish I was. When I entered the lobby there were three men there. You'll got it all in your report and... one of them split. He ran upstairs. I became suspicious so I followed him. And he ducked into room 212. Did you accustom? No. I know better than that. So I went back down to the lobby and saw the room clerk. Charles Lubice. Yeah, I guess. I can't remember his name. And found out that this fella, Kerrigan was registered in 212. So I called R&I and... found out that also that there was a warrant out for his arrest. It's a vehicle code violation 21453A and a failure to appear. Yes, that one. Hey. Now there's my man. Keep your hands off me! - Hi, Bumper. - Hi, baby. - What's this all about? - Look, I'd appreciate it... if you'd go over there and talk to Sergeant Bronski for a little bit, ha? Yeah. Hey, Grady Arlington Wacker! So that's a lousy vice cop don't know up there all those nice citizens. Look, sweetheart. Just go on. He'll explain the whole thing. Little alone to do it? Charlie! Now, who's the hell want you around here... Did you tell him that Kerrigan's lawyer was here for his personal notes? Do you have any? No, I never keep notes, Mr. Sights. But I can tell you that Kerrigan's gun was right there on top of the dresser... in plain sight next to the money that he'd stolen from the market. As a matter of fact the money still had the bank wrappers on it. - So you didn't have to search the room? - No. Okay, getting back to this. Well, when I found out that there was a warrant for Kerrigan I... went back to the desk clerk and asked him for a key, a pass key. And then I went back upstairs and I knocked on the door, identified myself and... when I thought I heard a window opening I... let myself in. Okay, so you entered the room legally and then attempt to serve the warrant? Well, I didn't have the warrant but I knew of it's existence. Same thing. - Oh, beautiful probable cause. - I thought so. - And no problem with 844 of the penal code. - No. - And no search procedure problem. - No. Now, look, Mr. Sights. You've got the full report right in front of you. We're not in court yet. So just tell me why are you here? Morgan. Look, I'm interested in the facts. I don't know how those other guys at the D.A.'s office operate... but I want to be on the firmest kind of ground every chance I get to get there. Just a couple of more questions, that's all. Well, bust me for tellin' it to someone else, sweetheart. Anything else that I... can do for you? No. We want you to drop by and see us. We miss you. Yeah, I'll try to do that, Lorraine. Well... The best witnesses are always dead. Hey, Bumper, old buddy! Long time no see. How have you been, huh, good friend? - Hey, what do you say, Swifty? - Oh, a little here a little there. That homicide dick would like to talk to you. I...I ain't killed anybody. No but I'll kill you unless you give him a straight-laced. - Go on, huh? - Okay, okay. See you later, Bum. All right, Morgan. For what reason did you go to Garrigan's Hotel? To check the lobby for winos. I've made a few arrest there. Yes but for what reason? To... protect the premises from possible damage from vandalism. That's right. - Do you want to look at that again? - No. - Do you want to make any changes? - No. Mr. Sights, I've given testimonials a few thousand times. I think I'm a good, sincere, honest witness. And I worked hard at my courtroom demeanor. So don't worry. This'll be okay. Satisfied? Not unless you tell me don't worry. Don't worry, counsel. You've got a dead-bang case. All right, satisfied. Well, gentlemen, I... Sorry to take so much of your time. Well, thank you very much and I do appreciate it. If it isn't some tight pants public defender trying to make a sack of all... and make a case out of everything. It's a guy like him. He's got to check the calendar... and the navy department to tell you what day it is. What really happened? Well... Percy Qodoo was my snitch. You know him. And I promised him twenty bucks if he'd bring me in something good. And he put me on to this Kerrigan. So I went over there, busted in the door... and got the guy and the gun and the dough. Sure, Sergeant. No trouble at all. Anytime. Anytime at all. Gee, Bumper. I could've phoned this one in. I didn't see Millie all that night. Okay, Swifty. - Querido! - Hi, Tootsie. Now, look... Why don't you just go upfront there? You see that good-looking guy, Sergeant Bronski? You sit with him and I'll be with you in a few minutes, huh? - Hasta Luego! - Sí. I didn't find out about the traffic warrant until couple hours later... so I just slipped it into my arrest report... as probable cause. Cruz, get those eyes off me. So I tidied it up a bit. Listen, this Kerrigan is a no good... Robberies got him figured for six more jobs. Two in Rampart and then four in Centro. Mom and Dad market kind of stuff. He pistol-whipped a 71 year old clerk... and the poor old guy's blind now. You know what I think? I think you're one lucky copper. That there was a traffic warrant out the guy. Hello, Harry. The less conversations I have with you from now on the better off I'm gonna like it. Now, Harry... You know, we got to do what we got to do. - I see you get rid it out real quick. - It took long enough. You know something? This stuff is too big. You ain't gonna bother nobody rousting me. Morgan, you don't understand. People want us in this business. What's a guy get for bookmaking? Even a big guy? A lousy fine. That's what he gets. Who does time, ha? You ever see a book get joint time? You name one. Hell no, you ain't! Everybody bets with bookies. And those that don't. They like some other kind of vice. Morgan, give up! You've been a cop all these years and you still don't know enough to give up fighting. You finished, Harry? Yeah, except I'd like to know why are you keep wasting your time? Very good question. Now, let's see if I have a romantic answer. You know years ago there was a guy in New York... that kept writing funny stories about bookies. I used to read them and I thought that they were funny, laughable and loveable. Until I met sleazy punks like you. Then I realized that if little things could go wrong... sure as hell big things could go wrong. And there's nothing laughable or loveable or funny about you. Because you're in a sleazy, slimy, lousy business. As Mr. Winehouse lawyer I would like to inform you... Oh, shut up! When you returned to the manager's apartment, did you look at the name on the register or did you ask Mr. Lubice who live there? - I asked for the register. - Did you read the name on the register? - Yes, sir. - What was the name? As I've testified, sir, it was the defendant's name, John B. Kerrigan, room 212. Did you then asked Mr. Lubice the name of the man in room 212? No, I read the name myself. You read the name for yourself. Okay. When did you find out about the warrant? Right away. I called R&I and they... They told me of the vehicle code violations. Did you use Mr. Lubice's phone? No, sir. I used the payphone down the hall. I have no further questions for this witness. You may step down. Call your next witness. Call José Lubice. Mr. Lubice, when Officer Morgan came to you on the day in question... to ask to see the hotel register. Did he ask you who lived in 212? Nope. He just asked to see the register. - What's he trying to do? - I don't know. Mr. Lubice, do you remember whose name appeared on the register? Sure. Him. Do you mean the defendant in this case? The man on my left? - Yes, sir. - And what's his name? John C. Currigan. Would you repeat that name, please, and spell it? John C. Currigan. - J-O-H-N... - Spell the last name, please. Currigan. C-U-R-R-I-G-A-N. And the middle initial was C as in Charlie? Yes, sir. Did you ever see the name Kerrigan, John B. Kerrigan on the hotel records? That's K-E-R-R-I-G-A-N. - No, sir. - Did you ever see the name Kerrigan anywhere? No. Did you anytime tell Officer Morgan... that the man in 212 was named John B. Kerrigan? K-E-R-R-I-G-A-N. No. Because that's not his name as far as I know. What happened? Well, this... Kerrigan used an alias when he checked into the place. - But if that is he on the make she... - But you saw what was on that register! Morgan, what else did you perjure yourself on? No way to call anybody on it. - Has it been fixed? - Oh, yes. Sure. They sent a repairman. - But it wasn't working then? - No. Did Officer Morgan use your phone... to calling about the warrant? He didn't call anybody. That's what I'm trying to say. I have a question, Mr. Hughes. Of course, Your Honor. Who was in the lobby that morning when Officer Morgan came in? Nobody but me. There was nobody else there, Judge. The counsel please approach the bench. She's gonna dismissed the case. I don't know what to advise you. Sit down. No calls. Behind all my years on the bench I've never had that happen. I'd like to know why you did it. Well, I... I wanted him off the street, Your Honor. You know what the search and procedural arrest rules are like these days... I know all about them, Officer Morgan. I'm on my bench five days a week. Well, I'm on my beat five days a week and... I'd hardly ever get a conviction if I didn't embellish it a little bit... when these crooks come into court. There are degrees of truth and untruth, Officer Morgan. But in this particular instance it was something more than a little bit. But, Your Honor, I knew what kind of a punk he was... We're talking about lying. I've seen witnesses lie thousand times. And I know every defendant lies to a greater or lesser degree. But if a policeman stretched the hell out of the truth in probable cause situations. That even giving them the benefit of the doubt. But I never, never thought a Los Angeles policeman would sit in my court... and falsify his entire testimony. Sickening! Well, I didn't falsify all of it, Your Honor. Currigan had the gun. The money was right there. I didn't figure he had that gun to stir his soup with. - I tell you he's a dangerous man. - And I tell you that means nothing! But I think it means somehting. I know the man. I know what he's done. The people that he's hurt. What he's liable to do. It's infinitesimal compare to the harm... a man like you can do. You aren't an enforcer of the law. - You acted with honour disregard for the law. - But, Your Honor... We have court decisions that presume the goodness of people... behind all logical presumption. But these laws the higher courts will handle are still law. Judge, that guy... That guy is a free man right now because of the way you arrested him. And the way you lied about it in my court. I find that unconscionable. I'm going to have the district attorney issue a perjury complaint. And that, Officer Morgan, is it. Your Honor, there's something I've got to tell you. I know what i've done wrong. I know what kind of trouble I'm in. And we both know I'll be convicted. I'm not afraid of that. I'm not afraid of losing my pension either. But I want to ask you... to give me a chance, please. Why should I? Because I'm one hell of a cop, Your Honor. Out there on the beat there're... people who really look up to me. They think I'm something special. They know that most cops put in their nine hours and... then they go home to their families. But guys like me do our living on the beat. That's are family. That's me. That's the way I am. Don't get down on all of us, Judge. Most cops don't lie at all. And others just lie a little bit like you said. And only a... few like myself would do... What I did in your courtroom. And there's something else. I'm leaving the Police Department tomorrow after twenty years. My last day. And damn it! If I've been able to read that man's name on the register... I wouldn't be in the fix that I'm in! I'm fifty lousy years old, Your Honor! And farsighted. And I've been kidding myself that I'm still thirty. And can do a young man's job. When I can't cut it. I just can't cut it anymore. All right. I'm going to request the deputy district attorney... to say nothing of your perjured testimony in his report. Now get out of here. If I'd wonder if I've done the right thing about you. Earnie. Shine? No. Not today. Why not? You've got a real tight job for such a skinny kid. I'm trying to do it for buck. What's the matter with that? Nothing as long as you do it honest. There you go again. Put me down. Tell me something. What do you do for fun? Go to ball game now and then. - What ball game? - Dodgers, Rams. When was the last time you saw the Dodgers? - A couple of years ago. - With friends? My business if I don't have any friends. I know what you mean, kid. You can be tougher all alone. But it's no good going through this world all by yourself. - See you around, Officer. - Hey. Why don't you call me Bumper? Why not? See you around, Bumper. So long, Rudy. From you? Don't be silly, Officer Morgan. Having a good time? In my country that dance is called "sprinkling the salt". If the dancer had bags of salt on each hip with little hole in it. She would make a perfect white ring around herself by the time the dance ended. Pretty salty, ha? What happens after that? Yeah. After that my sister puts on a uniform, goes back to the kitchen... and serves our customers. Enjoy yourself. How much do you figure she'd cost? Who knows? Don't you wanna ask? Is that all. He gets mad on me. He takes a swing at me. So I just stumble. Did you kill him? Mary gave me that. I don't know. I...I... I miss Mary. The kids grown up and gone. Now thirty years ago I took Mary to dance downtown to the old Marigold Hotel. Remember the old Marigold with the wood and curtains of...? Sure it's on my beat I... Well, there was a night we decided to get married. Once every year usually on our anniversary I'd... take Mary down to the Marigold and we check in. And we usually staying a little suite up there on the top floor. And it overlooked the lousiest view of the alley you ever saw but... But I don't know. Mary liked it. I don't know. I... I liked Mary. I did. She was a... She was a great dame, Bumper. Yeah. I never liked you. I don't know why I come to this rotten, crummy place with you. - I know. - Yeah? Yeah. Eight years ago... New Year's Eve at your house... I'd tried to jump on your wife. I was stoned and you were stoned. She was stoned. She hit me on the head with a stew pot. Threw me out. Mary...Mary told me about that. We had a laugh about it. No. She didn't tell you about it. That's what's been bothering you. I told you about it. Just now. You know what? You're worse officer than I am. God knows I'm... miserable enough for ten man. But you sit there... You tell me how you busted Millie Haskins's killer. How you're gonna look so great when you quit the department. Yeah. Let me tell you something. You're not quitting the department. You're not quitting. Cruz is quitting for you. Cruz does everything for you. You haven't got the guts. You haven't got the guts to live all those free meals. Or that rotten...discount booze. All those guys pressing your pants for nothing. For nothing. For nothing. Cruz... Cruz's carrying your conscience around for you ever since he got on the department. Why he adopted you I'll never know. You'll never left if it wasn't for Cruz. All those guys sayin': "Hi, Bumper! Hello, Bumper!" All those rotten crums. Because all you ever wanted was the gutter. The gutter. All those hookers. Somebody else's wife. As long as it'll be for free. I'm sorry. You're young. Everybody's so young. "Mr. Wonderful" is here. I don't know what you do out on that street all day... or what it's done to you. What is makes you want or think you want. Maybe I never asked. Maybe I never even wanted to ask. Or maybe, God forbid, I never even wanted to know! Well, talk to me! Damn it! Talk to me! Cassie... How do you like the name Rudy? Overnight just the matter come up with a perfect kid for us. He's all alone. He's... practically takes care of himself. But he's a real boy. He's... strong, gutsy. Doesn't let anyone push him around. Kinda like he was made to order for you and me. But... 13-14 years old. What I was thinking was that... maybe tomorrow night we could... get a later airplane, you know. And then I bring him over here and we could have dinner and... get acquainted. You know I... I've never really felt whole since I... lost my own boy. I don't know. Maybe you won't believe this but... When Billy was four years old... he read and print. And he had this little kitten. He wrote me a Valentine's card. Tied it around the kitten's neck. And he said: "Dear Dad!" "I love you." "Love: Billy Morgan." You won't believe it but he was only four years old. Cassie... I'd like to have Rudy. I want to have a boy again. For us. All right. Hold it. Hold it down. Let's go out and make our streets safe for our citizens. Dismissed. Hold on one minute. Like all of you guys are keep your eyeballs peeled for a daytime burglar and vandalism. He's gonna have a returning on a water vows in a house when he finishes with it. Why he does it? I don't know. But there's a woman on Pearl Street with a lot of soggy carpeting. That promises to deliver it to the lieutenant personally if we don't nail the bird. So guys keep your eyes open. Hey, mano... - What are you gonna do for lunch today? - Nothing. Why? I want you to pick the best, most expensive place in town... somewhere that don't bounce for a bluecoat. You mean you're actually gonna pay for a meal on duty? Well, it's about time. It's my last day. - Where do you want to eat? - Well, you can take me to Seymours. Oh, no. Nothing on my beat. Look, I'l meet you there at one o'clock. There's a place in Beverly Hills I want you to go to. - You gonna be able to make it, mano? - Yeah. I'll be in good shape by then. Meantime I just gonna cruise around and think how great it's gonna be... not to have to look anymore, not to have to do it anymore. - Any luck, Charlie? - Not yet. I'm still working on that. - I was hoping that today we might... - I know, Bumper. I know. Today isn't over. Something still might happen. Cruz? I want to thank you for arranging things and... letting me on my own. I know it was you that put the word in the lieutenant's here and Charlie's. And all these years I've packed in every kind of scum that you can think of. But I've never torn off a killer like this one. Looks like I never will. But it did sure feel good to dance off knowing that... you got a guy like Landry's sweating under for murder and rape. But you flashed off his half mask. You know you still got me around. I'll see you at one. More coffee. What's with the cat, pal? He's a baby. Hey, this is an eatin' place. Get him out of here. Hey, you! Officer! Tell him to get that dirty cat out of here! I run over every cat I see. You little off your route this morning, don't you? - What's that mean? - That means you don't belong here. You just passing through only not fast enough. Come on! Get out! If I ever get you run over a cat I'll break your neck! Looks like it's working. Feel like I know that man already. Do you ever think why they call this pigs? - More? - No. No more. Thanks, Bumper. Por nada. How much do I owe you? Don't mention it. Come see us anytime. 1-X-L-40-5. 1-X-L-40-5. 1-X-L-40-5. 1-X-L-40-5 go to the corner of Sixth and Main for a possible DB. 1-X-L-40-5, roger. You've been the manager of this hotel for a long time, no? Yes. Yes, I have. - Used to be quite a place, ha? - Yes. Yes, it did. How do you know he jumped? He saw it happened. Anyone else's seen it? I don't know. - Aren't you going to look at him? - In a minute. - Do you have an electrician here? - Not these days. Not anymore. Well, you better call somebody. Those lines look hot to me. Why, it's Officer Grogan! And he did even register. Hey, Bumper, we just got a code two call. You go to headquarters, right now. We handle this. Landry's got a lawyer. He'll be rid it out in a couple of hours unless we can make the murder charge. Once he's out, Bumper. That ideas are gonna be tough to make. We still got a shot. You just got to hold something good. Do you know her? Yeah. Her name is Phyllis Van or something. She used to be a pal of Millie Haskins. Well, they were pals at that last night. She and Millie left the Round Table together with the same guy. Do you know where she hangs out? I know her old man lives down to Long Beach somewhere. She goes down to spend her time when the things get slow. Willy Styles. Used to be a boxer. Not a bad guy. Main Street Gym's gonna be able to tell you where you find him. Okay, Bumper. This may be it. Hi, Officer Morgan. Garcia? - Are you Miss Garcia? - Yeah. - Is that him? - No. I was looking for Rudy Garcia. Is he here? No. - Do you know where he is? - I don't know. Are you his sister? Look, lady. That's a simple question. You don't have to go to jail to answer it. Do you know whether you're his sister or not? Oh, yeah. She is. You're name's Slim? Yeah... Thank you. I went by the school. They said he wasn't there. You know where he is? - What's he done? - Nothing. I'm a young woman. I've got a lousy job. The lousiest! Nobody should expect me to raise a kid brother. I even been turned down for welfare. If I was some swag cat they'd give me all I wanted. Is he in some kind of trouble, isn't he? No. I told you that he's in no trouble. When he comes back tell him that Officer Morgan would like to see him. Morgan. He didn't come home last night. - Where did he go? - I don't know. Young kid like that out all night and you don't know. He likes to run away now and then. They ought to take him away from you... and put him with a family that knows where he is and what he does. That's okay with me. Do you got anything in mind? I might. But that will be okay with you? Oh, yeah. Sure. I thought so. Let me go! Bennies. - How much did those heroes charge you? - Seven bucks. Do you have to put those things on me? I ain't gonna hurt you. I thought you're a smart kid. But you've got taken. They'd way too much. I know you won't believe this but it's the first time I ever bought them. Oh, sure. I don't know what it supposed to cost. Didn't you ever do anything wrong? Just keep movin'. What could I expect. How could I ever except that a cop to be human being. I wouldn't except a human being to be a human being. You should stay to home last night. - You were my place? - Yeah. Great place, ha? - What did you think of my sister? - Fine personality. How long you've been dropping bennies? I tried it a couple of times. I don't know why. How many tubes a day do you sniff? I'm no glue head. It makes guys crazy. I've never sniffed paint either. - Where did you run away to last night? - Oh, some crummy movie. I was alone and I felt right and I wanted to see some people. Guys with the green shirt and the yellow shirt? I met them this morning when I came out from the movie. Black-and-white fever, kid. People do dumm things when they see a police car. Don't run on me because I don't want to excercise. You should have stucked to your shoe shine business. What do you got there, Bumper? A fella that was doin' pretty good in business... until he decided to get into another business. Stay put. No big thing. Just might teach him a lesson. I'll book him and then pencil out a quick arrest report. Worthwhile for me talking to him? First time, he claims. I'll take care of it. When should I cite him in? We're up to here with cite-ins. Make it Tuesday, Bumper. You know something? He let out one yelp. Just one. Gutsy kid. Drink up. He knew your name. Him. Probably he knows all about you. I figure you're famous or something. You and your sister are gonna have to come back here on Tuesday and... meet with an investigator... who decides whether to C and R you or send you to court. What's C and R? Crush and Rupture? Counsel and Release. Now, if this is the first time that's all that will happen. Otherwise he'll have to send you to court. - What's your telephone number? - 5-5-5-3-0-3-3. I've got busted once before for running away. Don't worry. They're not gonna send you to court. - How do you know? - They will do what I ask. You'll let me go? - What's your sister's first name? - She calls herself Sarah. Hello, Sarah Garcia? This is Officer Morgan, Los Angeles Police. I was there before. I've just arrested your brother for possession of dangerous drugs. I want you to come down to the police building and pick him up. That's at the corner of First and Los Angeles Street. Miss Garcia, you're going to have to come down and pick him up... and then you and your brother are going to have to come back here on Tuesday... and talk to an investigator. Maybe he can help you with some of your troubles. If you don't pick him up I'm gonna have to put him in Juvenile Hall... and I don't think you'd like that. Lady, I am only the arresting officer... and I want you down here to pick him up in fifteen minutes. Do you understand? Yes. That'll be all right. All right. She doesn't want me, does she, Bumper? Your Uncle Jake'll pick you up. Finish your drink. Well, I've got to tell you something, Myles. I've already got one cross in my life and I don't need another. Kid's uncle is gonna pick him up. I've informed his sister of the arrest. I've got to meet a guy downtown and I'm late. You take care of him and I'll finish my report later. Sure, Bumper. I'll take care of it. Hey, Bumper. Where are you going? Hit the streets. But you were really at my place. You were really looking for me. You really wanted to see me. I can't help it, kid. I don’t have what you need. Damn you! Damn you! You just a cop! Nothing but a lousy, stinking cop! Hey, look at this. It's for a very good friend. - What do you have? - Ah. Just coffee. How you doin', Ruthie? Thank you. - Hey, Bumper. - Hi, Charlie. - Look who we got right in the neighborhood. - Who's that? Florence William Spangler. Mr. Spangler killed a woman in Denver three weeks ago. Same M.O. he used on Millie Haskins. We just got a confession. The whole thing just broke for us, Bumper. We... We had him on a tank all this time. Bumper, I... I want to thank for all the help on Landry. I wish he'd turned out to be our boy. Yeah. Well, see you, okay? Bumper. Bum. You've got to help me, Bumper! You give me only one dollar. Now, Arthur. I can't fold up any more money and stick it in your arm. Please, you gotta. You just gotta! Hey, Bumper. Cruz? Ruthie, for God's sake! Call an ambulance! Cruz... Poor, dear Cruz. I'm so glad you came over here right away. I know what he meant to you. All those beautiful black-eyed children he loved so much. He loved everybody so much. Too much. He was a foolish little man. He was liable to run away none with this... "You shouldn't be afraid of love", he told me. "Your soul's in danger if you don't love." He was wrong. Why? What the hell does an old guy like me know about love or soul... or God's truth that he kept talking about. All I know is my job. Cassie, I want you to go on to San Francisco tonight. There's a lot that you can do there. There's nothing you can do here. Okay. And... Will see Rudy later? I've been working on that all day... I've been thinking about it and... There's a lot more to talk about, Cassie. Will I see you later on this week in San Francisco? Bumper. Ever? Well, that's just about does it, doesn't it? Go on. You better get back to your beat. There you are. There are some crazy things. That you're leaving the cops. Leaving the beat. - Yeah? - Yeah. Where would I go? What would I do? Neither do I. Be careful. Huh, Bumper? Yeah. Hey, Bumper. One of these days you gonna slay that dragon.
