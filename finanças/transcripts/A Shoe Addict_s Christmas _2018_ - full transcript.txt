Oh, Alex. Great, here. Hold these. More Christmas decorations? You can never have too much Christmas. Says the woman named "Noelle." My mother loved the holidays. You know, she wanted to name me Jingle but my dad talked her out of it. Well, my mother only likes the retail aspect of Christmas, so let's not over-do it, okay? Oh, speaking of your mother. Mrs. Fulton! Hello, Merry Christmas! Hello Noelle. Alex, is there a reason your HR manager is decorating the store? I wouldn't think that would be on her list of job responsibilities. Well no, of course not, but, umm- I volunteered to help. It's three weeks until Christmas. So all hands on deck... the halls! [laughs] Well, I'm half expecting Santa's elves to appear and burst into song, so I think we can assume the halls are fully decked. And besides, shouldn't you be working on the Christmas charity gala for the fire station? I have already talked to Captain Pearson and we're meeting this week. Fulton's is the major sponsor for the first time this year, so we have to make a good impression. Think tasteful. Elegant. Refined. I'll make sure it's all taken care of. Are you sure everything's taken care of? This is very important, Noelle. Alex, don't worry. Besides, a fancy charity gala means I have an excuse to buy a new pair of shoes. Everyone should have someone in their life who looks at them the way you look at footwear. But they're more than just footwear. I mean they are an expression of our mood. They're... they're happy or serious or fun or flirty. Heh. Every pair tells a story. Well just make sure the story they tell is one my mother will approve of. Alex, I promise. The shoes, and the fire station gala will be tasteful, elegant and refined. Thank you so much. [sighs] Nice work out there Jake. I especially liked the part where you slide down the fire escape to getkto tck. Well, it was faster than taking the stairs and more fun. But not exactly appropriate behaviour for a future deputy chief. Hey! Can we do Secret Santa for our Christmas party this year? Peter, in all the years that you've known me, has changing the subject ever worked? Never. Look Teddy it's not a done deal yet. I don't want to talk about it and jinx it. You sure it's not because you're having second thoughts? Yeah, I mean it's an office job, Jake. You're not going to miss being out on the front lines with us? It's called a career path. Can't slide down fire escapes for the rest of my life. Why not? Lots of people do. Your dad did. Yeah. My dad the hero firefighter. But, it's time I grow up. Do my own thing. The only bad part is how much you guys are going to miss me. Oh, I think we'd find a way to muddle through. Nah. You guys are going to be devastated without me. It's gonna kill ya! Yeah just for that you're stowing the rest of the equipment. Sorry. No can do. I'm, uh, moving into my new place tonight. Ahh, a Christmas shoe tree? Lorna I love it. I knew you would. Here. You know, a picture of this would be inspiring. Maybe even the most inspiring photo of the year? Oh, Lorna come on. You need to enter the contest this year. They're showing entries at the Christmas charity gala. So it's like kismet. I haven't taken photographs in years. Submit the one of the woman by the Christmas tree. That is a great picture. You're a great photographer. Yeah, well I gave that up. Now, I am a great Human Resources Manager. When I recommended you for this job it was supposed to be temporary. Just somethin' to help you pay the bills while you got over What's-his-face. His name is Matt. I know. I just prefer What's-his-face. Noelle, that was three years ago. You need to get over him. I am over him. You still follow his Instagram. He's still a photographer. Sweetie, it is time for you to get back out in the world. Personally, and professionally. Lorna, this may not be my dream job but I am making the best of it. Noelle, you know I love you. But this isn't a time for you to be making the best of it. It's a time for you to be filled with the spirit of Christmas. We work in retail. I'm just trying to get through Christmas alive. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I promise, I'm okay. I work with great people, my dad and I are good. And I have a best friend like you. [laughs] You're only saying that because I always get you shoes for Christmas. No, it's because I love you. And because of the shoes. Okay. This year, I'm gonna switch it up. I'm thinkin' boots. Like those black ones you used to have. Yes. I loved those. [laughing] Merry Christmas, Mrs. Claus. [phone chimes] Hey dad! You never visit on a Tuesday. I'm sure that at some point I've come on a Tuesday. You call on Friday and you visit on a Sunday. The only time you visit on a Tuesday is if it's a holiday or if something's wrong. Actually, uh, I mean there is something. I- That's what I mean! That's what I mean!! Sorry. Uh, there is what? Uh, oh nothin'. It's... [sighs] You two loved to play dress up. And her shoes. We could've had a much bigger house if it hadn't been for your mother and her shoes. Yeah, it runs in the family. Still love the necklace? I do. I never see you wear it. Oh, it never goes with my shoes. Ya hungry? I could, um- No! No. I'm... I'm fine. I, you know, I should get going. You just got here! Yeah, but you're busy and I don't want to bother you. I'll just, uh, I'll call you Friday. And see ya Sunday! Yeah. Noelle, you sure nothing's wrong? Yeah, I'm sure. Bye, dad. Bye. [door closes] Oh! Careful! Careful. Oh. Careful. Here let me, I'll move some of these. I'm... I'm fine. I'm... Oh! [crash sound] [sighs] Is this your obstacle course? Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm moving into 3G. Oh, I, uh, live in 2G. Oh! 2G. I promise not to hold it over you. 'Cause my apartment's... it's over. Yeah, I... I get it. I get it. Hey, let me help you with those. Oh, I, I can- Really, it's the least that I can do. Here, no- I can really manage. Woah! Woah! [crashes to floor] Ah. I'm really making a great first impression. Not going to forget this anytime soon. I, I got it. I'm Jake, by the way. Noelle. As in the first! First... Noelle. I'll just call you 2G. [Instrumental "Deck the Halls"] ♪♪♪ Oh, Noelle! I need a favour. Can you find an old employee file from the 1990s? Oh. Hmm. Well everything back to 2000 is on the computer, but anything before that would be paper files in the basement. Hmm... I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. It's part of a Christmas gift for my mother. An old employee file? Wouldn't she prefer a sweater? Well, it's about the people who used to work here when my dad ran the store. I'm getting some old photos and some funny stories and I'm putting it all into an album for her. Aww, that's so sweet. Uh, the employee, it is, uh, Charlene Pennymar. Oh. I'll see what I can find. Thank you. Mm-hmm. It is really coming down out there. Hope you didn't have any big plans for tonight. Oh, no my Christmas tree came this morning, so I'm just putting on my comfy pyjamas and putting up the decorations. Good plan. I'll see you tomorrow? Yes, you will. Great. Be safe out there. I will. Hunh. [exhales] [wind blowing] Where are you, Charlene Pennymar? Wherever you are, you're going to stay here 'til tomorrow. Hello? Hello? Anybody here? Where is everybody? [doors rattle] [phone ringing] Hello. Alex. Hey, it's Noelle. The store is empty, and dark and all the doors are locked. We shut down early because of all the snow. I sent everyone home. Alex! I was in the basement, looking for that file. Oh, no. Noelle I am so sorry. I had no idea you were still down there. Well, I mean, just tell me how I can get out 'cause I don't have a key. There is no way out without one. Okay Alex, what am I gonna do? It's okay. I'm gonna come down there. Or I will send someone. Have you even looked outside? Because it's snowing like crazy. I will figure it out. And if I can't, I will just call the fire department and we'll get them to break down the doors. No, now that's a little extreme. It's either that or you spend the night in there by yourself. There are worse places to get stuck overnight. Make yourself at home until I get there. But I will get there. I'm not leaving you in the store overnight. Okay. And be careful out there. Yeah, will do. Huh.

Well, I was looking for some shoes, and they were there on the... the very tippy top... So you climbed the rack? Well, they're very important shoes, they... they go with my... Wait, who are you and how did you get in here? I'm Charlie. And, and it, it is just... Oh gosh, it's just so nice to meet you, Noelle. Wait, how did you know my name? Oh, I know lots of stuff about you. I... I've been watching you. It's okay, don't worry, they... they said that you'd be skeptical. Are "they" doctors? They said "she'll think you're crazy." Well, whoever they are, they were right. Well... well of course they were. They've been doing this a long time. I... I'm new to all of this. New to what? Well, I'm here to... Help... help you... um. Sorry I have to look at my notes... Um... to help you overcome your troubles, of course. Oh, but I'm not troubled. Well, you... you must be because, I wouldn't be here if you weren't. It was Alex who sent you here with the key to have a little fun. [laughs] Ha ha. Very funny, Alex. No, I'm here to help. Help with what? You see dear, it seems that at some point you stopped trying. You stopped pursuing the things in your life that meant something to you. What are you talking about? No, I am here because something big is coming. And if you miss it this time, it could be the last time. What is it? That I can't tell you. Why not? Employee manual. That part I remember. Well then how are you gonna help me if ya' can't tell me. Well, okay, see that's why I was climbing up the... uh... uh... shoe shelf, because when you were little you used to go shoe shopping with your mother. And then you would go home and you would play dress up. How did you know that? And then when you put the shoes on you would dream about all the possibilities. Put these on. Why? Because, well, you've lost faith. And, it's like you know it's there but it's like you don't really consider it anymore. Every pair tells a story. Don't you want to see what this one is? You know, I had a pair just like these. I know. Okay, I put the shoes on? What just... Yes! Yes, it worked! Now we go back to Christmas past. Wait what, where... It's Christmas Eve. Three years ago. Do you remember? My tree. I... I haven't decorated my tree yet. Oh, oh, no, no. That... that's a different tree. This is your tree three years ago. Maybe this will help you remember. [dings] Okay, I got wine and ice cream. I didn't know what type of breakup comfort food you need. Lorna? Oh, don't worry, she can't see me. I can't believe that Matt broke up with you on Christmas Eve. Who does that? What's-his-face. You called Matt What's-his-face. That's good. Never say his name again. I like it. Go with it. You'll remember everything. You're better off without him. You think so? I said "you think so?" I remember saying that. What? Nothing. He was holding you back. You're a much better photographer without him. That picture... is incredible. Where did you take it? Oh, at the tree lighting ceremony downtown last year. I don't even know who she is. I just thought she looked so... I don't know... hopeful. You know what, I'm gonna call my friend that owns that gallery. I don't need a gallery show, I need a job. I can't be Matt's assistant on photo shoots anymore. You can go out on your own. I'll call my friend right now. No Lorna, please don't. Don't. Not yet. You know, is the department store hiring? There might be something in human resources. But you don't really want to do that, do you? I mean, it would just be temporary. Okay. As long as it's just temporary. But it wasn't temporary, was it? That was three years ago and you're still there. And you never had your friend call the gallery owner. And I believe that this was the night that you put away all your camera equipment. Okay. I don't understand. Just, what's the point of all this? To imagine the possibilities. Okay. As long as it's just temporary. How many times in your life do you get a do-over? You know what? Go ahead and call your friend, the gallery owner. Atta girl! Oh! Sorry dear, uh, that jump made me dizzy. I haven't got the hang of it yet. Where are we? Ohhh... Ohh-hoo-hoo! You're right where you should be. This is exactly where you would be today if you had made different choices. Celebrating Christmas in your new apartment. You'd have a fabulous photography studio. Wait... my studio? Oh yes, yes, yes. You are one of the most sought-after photographers in the whole city. Wait. Is, is this a wedding ring? Certainly is. [laughs] Hey, honey! I'm home. Whoo! [laughing] That was fun! It was like a rollercoaster. Oh, I miss rollercoasters. What... What just happened? See, well, I knocked over that shoe rack and you were all "who are you?" And then I was like all "I'm here to help!" No, I mean, I mean, how, how did you just... I mean... what did you... Oh, I think I'm gonna freak out now. Oh, that's quite understandable. [sirens wailing] Don't move! [banging on door] I'm right here! It's okay, we'll have it open in a minute. [wind howling] [alarm wails] The manager gave me the alarm code. [alarm continues to wail] [sighs] That's better. You all right? I don't know, I'm... I'm not sure. There's a woman back there. We'll go find her. She's in the shoe department. But be careful. And whatever she says, do not put the shoes on. Okay. [clears throat] 2G! You're a fireman? Well, I hope so or I'd feel pretty silly in this getup. [laughs] Not a jokin' mood. Somethin' happened? Yeah. Something definitely happened. (Whispers) There's a weird lady in the shoe department. Okay. Weird how? Well it's, oh, it's kind of hard to explain. Don't look at me like that. She's the weird one. Got it. I'll make a note. There's no one in the shoe department. The rest of the crew is looking around but... No, no. No, no. She's there. She had a big red, wacky hat. I'm sorry but we haven't found anyone in here but you. Not the weird one. Got it. Cute antlers. You know her? Yeah. She's my new neighbour. Ah. Good luck with that! Yeah. Alright, let's go! All right. [Instrumental "Jingle Bells"] ♪ Hey, what's going on out here? Oh, now you're in trouble! Oh! Oh! Okay. Ooh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh! Make a break for it, boys! It's too late for me! I... I'm so sorry. Yeah, it's okay. Boys will be boys, right? How are you feeling today? Uh, good. Yeah. Better. Fine. I'm not weird. Oh. I never said you were. But you thought it. You did have on reindeer antlers. True. But I mean you were trapped inside a big store by yourself in the middle of a snow storm so that would put anybody on edge. Thank you for that. You're welcome. Hey, you're with the fire station that's doing the Christmas gala, right? Yeah, are you coming? Well, Fulton's is sponsoring it so I volunteered to oversee it. Really? What? Nothing. Nothing. Wow. For a guy who doesn't say a lot of things you sure do say a lot. You know what I'm saying. I'm just saying it's, uh, it's a really big deal for the fire station. It raises a lot of money for us. Yeah, I know. That's why I am determined to make sure it's a big success. In fact, I, here, need to call Captain Pearson right now. Hi! Captain Pearson. Noelle Carpenter. Good, thank you. I was calling to see when you'd have time to get together for the charity gala. Oh? Okay, then who will I be working with? No, I think I know how to find him. Thank you. Know where to find who? Your captain just volunteered you. Well I guess we're working together. Looks like it. Isn't that... Weird? I'll get the door for ya. Okay. How are you doing this? How are you just showing up whenever and wherever you want? Well, no I can't just like "show up" anywhere. You know, there are rules. Well, what are they then? Well, I'm still learning them. Oh great! So people can see you or can't see you? Oh no, no. That one I remember. No. People cannot see me when we take our little jaunts into your memories. See I wasn't there, you know, when they originally happened so I can't be seen there when you relive them. But I'm here now. So you're like a... because I mean... I... Well, I can... I can touch you. Of course! See, I'm just as here as you are. Yeah but apparently you don't need doors to get in and out. Well, that's just one of the perks of the job. Okay. I still don't understand why you're here. Okay. There's only two and a half weeks 'til Christmas. There's a lot of work to do. What kind of work? First, you can start by spending as much time as possible with that handsome fireman, Jake, working on the charity gala. Well... how do you know a... Did you have something to do with... putting us together to work? [gasp] Wait! Is he the guy that I'm married to? Is he the "honey, I'm home" guy? Now, don't go getting ahead of yourself. No, thinking that you know you know before you... you know... now that... that's a... that's a sure-fire way of never knowing. You know? No. And regardless, I am not looking for a romance. Romance? Who said anything about a romance? What you saw in that future? That was just one possibility but you have the power to change that by what you do or what you don't do and let's face it, you haven't done much of anything lately. So, go out and live your life! Have fun! Embrace the Christmas spirit. Well, yeah, but all we're doing is planning a party. It's just not all that exciting. [sighs] [clears throat] Noelle. We're talking about having faith here. You seemed to have lost some of yours. But we're going to help you find it. Now she uses the door. Well, I... I... I can... I can do the other thing... if you... I mean if that's your favourite... I can do the... No. No, no. Door is fine. [whispered] Okay. When will I see you again? When you need me. [Instrumental "Joy to the World" ] ♪ We usually put the stage over here, dance floor in front. Tables all around and the, um, silent auction and photo contest display can go over there. Photo contest? Oh, the most inspiring photo of the year. Yeah, all the photos will be displayed and then the guests can bid on them during the silent auction. Oh, nice. Mm-hmm. Looks like you had quite a party here last night. Oh, it was a wonderful event. You know what, maybe we should use some of this. Uh, I've been to the gala before and it's always elegant and refined. Which is why Fulton's wanted to be involved. Don't get me wrong, the gala's always... nice. But maybe we could... I don't know... make it a little less grown up. Well what do you want, a kids' party? Like with dancing snowmen? Oh! Maybe a snowball fight? No, but maybe we could... I don't know, just... Have a little more fun. Lighten it up a bit this year. We have all sorts of whimsical decorations. We can do some festive lighting, special effects. We can even make it snow in here. Snow. Snow. That would be fun! Yeah, no, the family that owns the store, they don't really do whimsy. So I say that we just stick with what we know works. Simple. Elegant. Grown up. Well, I will let you two figure it out and we'll chat more at our next meeting. Thank you. I think we should get going. I will call a cab. Hmm. There's no service in here. Oh, I'm sure we can find a cab out front. Huh. Why are there no cabs? Woah! Well Merry Christmas! You folks need a ride? You game? Sure, let's do it. Well, ho, ho, ho. Away we go. After you. [Instrumental "Jingle Bells" ] ♪ Ha! Just our luck. [Instrumental "Jingle Bells" ] ♪ So, with a name like Noelle you must go all out for Christmas. We used to. All the family holiday trimmings, but now I just go over to my dad's house. It's a pretty low-key day. You? Uh, my brother and I and his family go over to my mom's place Christmas morning. Presents, food and football. In that order? Well, it depends on who's playing. Later on in the day we go to the fire station for a big feast with the families. Oh, that sounds nice. Yeah. Yeah, I've been doing it ever since I was a kid with my dad. Oh, was your dad a firefighter too? Yes. He was the captain at our station. Hmm. Before Pearson. He was a legend there. Yeah. We all miss him, he passed away. Oh, I'm sorry. I know what it's like not to have a parent around during the holidays. My mom passed away a few years ago. Hence the low-key Christmas. Hmm-mm. Well I'm sorry too. [carriage grinds] Oh! You okay? [laughs] Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry about that! Must've hit a... pothole. Quite a pothole. You know what, it's okay. We'll just walk. Oh... okay. Okay. (Charlie) Rides on me. Merry Christmas! Thank you. Should we walk? Hmm-mmm. Ok. Thanks. Still don't understand why we couldn't find any cabs. Yeah, it was a real mystery. Listen, um, I was gonna go get something to eat. I was wondering if maybe you want to come with me? We can see if we have anything in common? About the... gala. Right. For the gala. Um. Well, thanks but I brought work home. So, I'll just meet you at the hotel tomorrow like we planned. Okay. See you then. You really need to stop doing that. Why didn't you go with him?! What difference does it make? I told you. I can't tell you. I can't keep having these conversations with you. I have work to do. Lorna! [gasps] Oh no. Not again. I just love the hustle and bustle of everybody doing last minute shopping! You! You tricked me. You ambushed me with footwear. Soy. I had to bring you back to Christmas past again. And why are you dressed like Mrs. Claus? I thought no one could see you when we went back in time. Well they can't. [laughs] I just... I just couldn't resist. I thought it was so cute. I've always wanted to play Mrs. Claus and so I thought that- Charlie. What are we doing here? I'm sorry. I'm taking you back to a moment where you didn't fight for what you really needed and you missed a chance that could have changed everything. It was Christmas Eve, two years ago. I knew these boots looked familiar. Should have known Lorna wouldn't get me the exact same pair. They're really cute. I know they are, aren't they? I usually wore them with a little cropped pant. Ooh! But I think they look pretty with a skirt- They do. No! That's not the point! What are we doing here? We are talking to your father. I was sure... I was sure this was the right place. I'm so bad at directions. Do you have one of those map things on your phone thingy? What? No. I. Oh! There he is. Whoo. Relief. [sighs] Oh, I remember this. I didn't know he was coming to the store. Just go with it. It'll all come back to you. Noelle, what are you doing here? I work here. What are you doing here? I forgot to buy your Aunt June a Christmas present. Well why didn't you call me? We could have gone to eat or something? Well I... I didn't want to bother you. And besides, we... we're eating tomorrow. Christmas dinner? Yeah, but that doesn't mean... Do you need any help picking out something for Aunt June? You're working, I'm just gonna grab a scarf or somethin'. I'll be in and out of here in five minutes. See you tomorrow, okay, sweetheart? You should have gone with him. Well he didn't want my help. Well, you should have insisted. I mean, you, you missed a chance to have a better relationship with your Father. By helping him shop? Well, how many real conversations have you had with him since your mother passed away? Or, are you both just not wanting to bother each other? Our relationship is fine. Noelle, he's your father. Things should be better than just fine. It's not too late. You can still catch him. No. No. This is just... It's all... Silly. [bells tolling] There's a crack in this Halligan. We need to replace it? Hello? Halligan? Right, yeah, got it. Where did you go? [sighs] Okay, the gala is two weeks away and so far Noelle has vetoed every single suggestion I've made. Uh-huh. Like what? I want it to be more light-hearted this year. You know, fun food, decorations... Big candy canes. Giant snowmen. That sort of thing. So, why don't we get the giant candy canes for the station party? Don't encourage him. Are you going to ask her to our station party, the night before the gala? Uh, why would I? It's... it's for the crew. But you can bring a date. Uh-huh. I'm not interested in dating her. Besides, she wouldn't... she wouldn't come anyway. Well you never know until you ask. I don't think it's a good idea. [laughs] What do you want? A sign? Yeah. A sign would be nice. Come on, get back to work! Yes sir! [chuckles] Retail therapy in our own store? It's convenient, and besides, maybe you might find something inspiring here? Hint, hint. Lorna, I am not entering that photo contest. I mean, I don't have time. Not when I'm planning a charity gala with someone like Jake. He wants a big snowman and giant fuzzy reindeer. He wants what? Mrs. Fulton. Alex. Hello! Noelle you know Fulton's doesn't do that sort of event. Uh, yes, our family has never been a big fan of, uh, what do you call it- I think it sounds fun. Right. That's it, fun. Not a fan. I promise, it will be an appropriate, tasteful event. Good. If you have any problems with the liaison at the station just let me know. All I have to do is make a call and they'll assign someone else. I have everything under control. Good. Alex. Yes. (Whispers) What are you doing? (whispers) I'm sorry. Up here is where we keep all of our decorations and lighting and special effects equipment. If you see something you like, you just put a sticker on it and we will hold it for you. Now, you take your time and I will be back. Thank you. Okay, I want all of this. Jake, I am so sorry but Fulton's is- Traditional and classy. Is there something wrong with that? No, but I think we can have some fun with it. Is that the only thing that's important to you, just having fun? No. You may be okay with not having fun but I am not. I have fun! You are the quietest neighbour I have ever had. Do you ever even play music, sing in the shower, yell at the TV? You really need to learn to live a little. Oh, just because I don't sing in the shower or want inflatable reindeer, at a tasteful Christmas gala, doesn't mean I don't live my life. When was the last time you took a risk? I put on shoes. Never mind. Not all of us can run into burning buildings. That's not risky. Okay, it's risky, but we have training and safety gear. We never go in without a plan. Well, then what do you consider risky? Well, I'm being considered for a big promotion at the fire department. Taking it would be a risk. Why? Because I'd be stepping on my Father's shadow. Asking people to take me seriously. So, which is it then? You want to be taken seriously or you want to have fun? Can't we have both? Hey. I wonder what that does? Oh, it says "trained personnel only." I'm trained. Oh yeah? Lots of big red switches in firefighting? Come on. You know you want to do it. What? No, Jake.

When she passed, I guess, you and I just haven't figured out how fill in all the places she used to be. You really think your Aunt June will like that? Oh, it's her favourite perfume. She wears it on special occasions. How do you know that? She lives on the other side of the country. Because mom bought it for her every year. [laughs] Yes, your mother was always much better at things like Christmas presents than I ever was. Oh. Do you remember that one year that mom was busy putting together the Christmas pageant and delegated the gift buying to you? Now, I still say that a savings bond is a very practical present. Uh, I was seven! [laughing] We should do this more often. Yeah, I agree. [camera snaps] Just give me... Look up here. [camera snaps] Yeah. There we go. They are great. Okay. Hey. Hi. I'm Noelle's dad. Hi there, Will. Wait, what just happened? You and your father! You start opening up to each other, talking, sharing... He encouraged you to go back into photography and... But that's not really the point. It's not? No. Your father, and your friends, you have good relationships. But you tend to keep everybody at a distance. I do not. Yes you do. Do not. Do too. Do not. Do... Noelle, have you told anyone about What's-his-face getting engaged? Have you told anyone about how that makes you feel? You know, that... that simple act of having cocoa with your father on Christmas Eve, and really connecting with him again, opened you up to your family and your friends. And love. This is where you would be today if you had made that choice. Hey, honey! I'm home. No! No! Who was coming to the door? Charlie! Charlie. [sighs] Oh... Hello! Hey dad. What's wrong? No, nothing's wrong. I promise. Um. I was wondering, do you want to go have some hot cocoa? Sure, sweetheart. I'd love to. Okay. I hope you came hungry because our chef has some yummy things for you to taste. The chef will be out in a minute so I will leave you to it. Okay. [sigh] So are you bringing anyone to the gala? Oh, as a matter of fact I am. My dad. We thought we should try to switch it up a little this Christmas. Oh. That's great. It's probably easier than bringing your... boyfriend? Oh, I'm not seeing anyone. Oh. And what about you? Are you, uh, bringing anyone to the gala? Nah. But, uh... maybe. I wonder what's taking that chef so long. Yeah. Should we go find out? Yeah. Hi, uh, we're supposed to be getting a tasting menu for an event we're doing? Wonderful! I've got something very special planned. Uh, special, really? Very special. We're going to make Christmas cookies! We are? Oh yes. They taste much better when you make them yourself. [sing-songy] ♪ With love! ♪ What about the tasting? We have to finalize a menu. We will get to that. First thing's first. Hmm. Well, it sounds fun. Hey, you look familiar, have we met before? Uh, no, I don't think so. No. Let's get started. Well, I'm game if you are. Sure, of course. Grab your aprons, we've got work to do!

Oh, well I like it. You really get to know the employees. So, we're a close-knit bunch. Like a big family. A close, happy family. How did you get into it? Uh, my friend Lorna helped me get the job. She does all the in-store displays. She did the Christmas shoe tree one this year. Shoes. I don't get shoes. What do you mean you don't "get" shoes? Well like, you know, the fascination with them. I mean, aren't they just things to keep your feet warm? No. A great pair of shoes can change your life. Change your life? Come on. Really? Well, every pair of shoes has a story. Every pair creates a memory. And sometimes all you have to do is put 'em on and then you remember where you were, and what you were doing in them. And then you think about what might happen the next time you do. You think about... The possibilities. You know what, I still just think they're things to keep your feet warm. Ah! Ha-ha! Ah! Oh! Oh, oh, oh! [laughing] ♪ You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear... ♪ Well thanks for walking me back to work. Oh, no problem. It was on the way home. And it gave us a chance to argue about dressing the band up like Santa and his elves. That is a sentence I bet you thought you'd never hear yourself say. That's been happening a lot. Um, listen... The station is having its Christmas party next week, the night before the gala. You mentioned that. And, I was wondering if... if you'd like to come? I would love to come to the party. Great. Great. Uh, I need to get back inside. We drew straws to see who would have to set up the Christmas tree. Oh. You lost. No! I won. Everyone else has to do equipment checks. [laughs] Well if, uh, you need any help... Yeah. Yeah. That'd be great. Okay. Hey guys, there's someone I want you to meet. Hey, is it fair that he got a civilian to help him with the tree this year? Yeah, I did it all by myself last year. Hey, don't you guys have hoses to check? [chuckle] Oh, I'm sensing a theme. Yeah, that was a present from my brother. I got him a stethoscope ornament. Doctor. Wow, firefighters and a doctor. Hmm. Heroic family. That's the family business. We all have capes. [laughs] Have you always wanted to be a firefighter? Yeah. When I was a kid, I used to come here and play on the trucks. I even had my own helmet with my name on it. Oh, that's sweet. So, what about you? What's your big dream job? Um... I wanted to be a photographer. But, um, I was for a while. Why did you give it up? Big dreams are elusive. And, and your new job, oh, what was it? The, uh, Deputy Chief? Is that your big dream now? It is. I think it is. But I have to admit, I can't imagine leaving this place. Yeah, all these people are your family. But it's Christmas time and that is when elusive, big dreams come true. I have an idea, just give me a second. I, uh, borrowed this from one of the guys. I thought it would be nice to get some pictures around the Christmas tree? I can do that. Thank you. Hey, guys. Gather around. We're going to do a family portrait in front of the tree. Put down the hoses! [laughing] Come on! Uh, Santa! Yay! [chatting and laughing] Okay everyone, squeeze in really tight! Say Merry Christmas! [together] Merry Christmas! What are you looking at? Oh, I took some pictures last night at the fire station when they were decorating the tree. You took pictures? Does this mean that you're entering the contest? I don't think so. I'll take that as progress. Is this because of the handsome firefighter? Uhhh, not entirely. Then what? Okay, I'm gonna tell you something but all I ask is that you get me a great pair of shoes to go with my straightjacket. And all this started with shoes? The irony, huh? Well it's quite a story. You think she's, what, your guardian angel? Do you believe me? I've known you a long time, you are the most reasonable, down to earth person I've ever met. You make me sound boring. [laughs] Well... Hey! No, look, in this case it's a good thing. You're not the kind of person that would make up something like this. Well, thank you. The question now is what am I going to do about it. Well, if it were me, I'd demand answers. Why is she here? Is Jake the mystery husband walking into the apartment? And what about the other guy at the photoshoot... Will? What if she doesn't tell me? Then you know what you have to do. Hey, you didn't jump! You're getting used to me. Actually, I'm glad to see you. We need to talk. Of course, of course. But first, another trip down memory lane. No. Not until I get some answers. Oh Noelle. What happened to having faith? Believing! No, I, I believe. I mean, I think I do. I just... That's not the point. I just, before taking any more leaps of faith I need to make sure the ground is going to be there when I land. But that's not a leap of faith. Now, is it? At all? I... I mean, I know I'm new to all this but, I mean, I think things have been going pretty well? So far. Huh? Don't you? Well. I don't know how it's going. I just think that it's time that I-- Noelle! We were looking for you. Who are you talking to? Oh, um, I was... Mrs. Fulton! That is a beautiful necklace you have on. Oh, thank you. I just spoke with Evelyn Moore at the hotel. She mentioned something about using a snow machine for the gala? Oh, well, that was just an option. Jake was-- Jake? As I suspected. This is the same man who wanted the snowmen and reindeer, yes? Yes, but we aren't doing that. Still, it's obvious he doesn't share our vision of what a gala should be. Yes, but it is for the fire station. But we're paying for it and it must fit with our brand. Right Alex? Right. Yes. Uh, we think it's time we made some changes. Oh. Are you taking me off the project? No. We're taking this Jake person off the project. Oh, please don't do that. The decision has been made, Noelle. No, wait. Uh... Let me tell him. I'll ask him to step aside. It... It'll be better for everyone that way. Fine. I'm sorry. Still think things are going pretty well? [sighs] Yup. He's right over there. Thanks. Hey. What are you doing here? I brought you some cookies. Really? Thank you. That's... that's really nice. And I wanted to talk to you. About what? The gala. Good, I actually wanted to talk to you too, I... I just wanted to say thank you. For what? Well, working on this has been a big responsibility but you've... you've let me put my own mark on it and I feel if I could do that with this, I could do that with my new job. What I'm really trying to say is, I'm having a really good time working with you. Me too. Good. I... I'm sorry. What was it that you wanted to say? Enjoy the cookies! Thank you. I'll see ya later. Yeah. Oh! These cookies are delicious! What? Those were supposed to be to soften the blow for when I told Jake that he couldn't work on the gala but-- Oh, Noelle, I, I'm sorry, I'll just put it... Look I, I know... I know that things have kind of hit a snag with you and Jake but it's all going to be all right. You know, you just have to-- Have faith. I know, I know. But I need some answers first. Okay. So, does everyone have someone like you, watching over them? Oh yes. They're always there, working in the background in ways you don't notice. You know, we're sort of like Santa's elves, you know. Well... only, you know, taller. But not everyone's shows up in the shoe department at Fulton's. Oh, no, no. That's for very special cases. I'm a special case? Very. Why? Well, you know, don't quote me, remember I'm just a rookie at all this, but, in some instances there are people who stray off the paths they're supposed to be on. So, it's like fate? Oh no. No, no, no, no. We still have choices, you know. And as you've seen, there are different possible outcomes. In fact, I probably shouldn't tell you this. There is a certain combination of decisions that would have made you the owner of a very successful chain of hot dog stands. I... really? Yeah. I mean for people to get everything that they really need in life, there's certain paths that we need to nudge them back onto sometimes. And... and sometimes it's... it's... it's more than just a nudge. Sometimes it's more like a... you know, like a... like a shove. You know? And, uh, you know, especially people who are starting to doubt that their prayers are worth being heard. I'm that far off my path? Well, I mean you're not "hot dog stand" off, but pretty far off. And it's starting to have a greater effect than you could poss- On what? Noelle, what we do or don't do in life makes a difference in the world around us. We have to decide what difference it is we want to make in the world. Okay, I mean, I know that you're new to this, but, I mean did I have someone like you before? Yes. Yes, you did. They... they send us where we are more needed. And... and they tried to nudge me? Oh, many times. Well they shoulda nudged harder. [laughs] Oh, that reminds me of a story. There was a great Christmas Eve blizzard and a man was trapped in the rising snow and he prayed to God to save him. So along came a sleigh driven by a jolly fellow who offered the man a ride to safety. But the man declined, saying that he had faith that God would save him. Then a while later the driver of the sleigh came back offered the man again but the man refused. Sleigh came back a third time. Now, the man was trapped in the snow up to his chin. But he still refused to get on board, insisting that God would save him. And do you know what happened? God saved him? Oh, no, no. Sadly, he, he passed. [gasps] Okay, that is a terrible story. Oh, I'm not done yet. So, the man is welcomed into Heaven by God. And he says to God, "God, I... I had faith in you. "Why didn't you save me?" And God said "What are you talking about? "I sent the sleigh three times!" [laughs] See, the point is, Noelle, the sleighs have been coming. But you just have not been willing to climb aboard. Where are we going this time? Christmas Eve. One year ago. Oh, I remember these. I wore them to the- - to the Christmas party I had. Do you remember what happened next? I don't. I, I, I'm not sure. Noelle? I know you like to wait 'til Christmas morning to open gifts, but open this one now. Okay. Thank you. The guy at the camera shop said it's the best one. Lorna. I know, I know, you don't take pictures anymore, but there's this annual competition. The most inspiring photo of the year. You need to enter it. Do you remember what you did with the lens after everyone had gone? Let me guess, the lens was a sleigh? That is one way of putting it. Okay, I get it. I passed up the chance to be a photographer multiple times but we already went over the career stuff. This isn't about your career. This is about love. Love? Just say yes. [camera snaps] Alright. Just give me... look up here. All right. Okay, last one! Yeah. There we go. Those are great. Okay. [sighs] Hey. Hi. I'm Noelle's dad. Hey there. Will. You know your daughter is, uh, quite the photographer. Yes, she is. I have to admit, I am not used to getting my picture taken. Especially not with the Santa cap on. But Noelle here, she's making it pretty easy on me. Well that's why everybody likes to work with her. Although, I think sometimes she works a little too much. She needs to save time for some kind of fun. Maybe go on a date. Dad! [laughing] I am so sorry! No, no don't be. My, uh, my dad used to try and set me up on dates all the time too. Oh. So is he correct? Do you really not have time to date? Oh, no, I... I do have time. I, I just uh, haven't been asked out by the right guy, I guess. Ah. But if the right guy did come along and ask you out, what would you say? I'd say, yes. Hey, honey! I'm home. [gasps] Wait. Will? I'm... I'm married to Will? I... Why, why, why isn't it Jake? I mean why are you pushing me towards Jake if he's not the one I'm supposed to end up with? What I am pushing you toward is taking chances. Embracing joy. Opening up to love. If you were willing to take that leap of faith with your heart, then the details aren't important. Your true love is out there. And he's waiting for you. But it's not Jake. I didn't think that people still borrowed sugar from their neighbours. Yeah, well your Christmas cookies inspired me so I'm making some for the station. Your place is, it's great. Hey, are these the pictures you've been taking? Yeah. May I have a look? Um, of course, yes. These are... these are incredible. Oh, thank you. I'm a little bit rusty. Well, if this is you rusty I can't wait to see what you're like when you're running at full speed. Those are back when I was doing it professionally. Wow. You are really talented. Thank you. I especially like that one. You should enter that in the photo contest. Oh, yeah, I... I would but I, um, I didn't even get her name. It was a spur of the moment picture. Well you have lots of other really good candidates here. You can submit more than one, right? Yeah, I think so. I think you should do it. Hey, would you mind, uh, making some prints of the photos you took at the fire station? Oh, sure. Yeah, I'll do it tomorrow morning and then give them to you at the party. So you're still planning on coming? Of course. I have to work but I will be there. Great. Well, I will, uh, I'll see you there. Okay. Oh, don't forget your sugar. Oh. Sugar. [laughs] Thank you. Sure. Good night. Night. These are amazing. You're gonna win the contest. And Jake is gonna love these. I hope so. Even if he isn't the guy I'm supposed to end up with. You never know until you try. And if he isn't, maybe the "honey, I'm home" guy will be at the party. Maybe that's why Charlie encouraged you to get close to Jake. Maybe. [phone rings] Oh, that's my dad. Hey dad, what's wrong? I get why that bothers you now. Good. But actually there is something wrong. Your Aunt June slipped on some ice and broke her leg. I might have to fly out there. Oh no. When? Tomorrow. You're gonna miss the gala. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Yeah, I was just really looking forward to going with you. I know but your Aunt June doesn't have any other family. Dad, I have to go. I love you. I love you too, sweetheart. Hey! Hey. I was in the neighbourhood, thought I'd pick up the prints. Yeah, here... here they are. Oh, good. Uh, I'll see ya tonight? Uh. Noelle, hold up a minute. Hi, sorry to interrupt. We just want to add some people to the guest list for the gala tomorrow night. Oh, great, the more the merrier. Hello. Helen Fulton. Alex. Fulton. Ah, you're the family that owns the store. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Jake Marsden. I'm with the fire station. Thank you for everything you've done for us. Oh. Yes. I hope you understand about the change we had to make. Don't you have to get things ready for tonight's party? It was nothing personal. I just felt it was better to have someone else working on the gala with Noelle. I... I don't... I don't understand. Mrs. Fulton I will follow up with the names on that guest list. Thank you. It was nice meeting you. What is she talking about? She heard about the things you wanted to do at the gala and... She didn't want you working on it and I was supposed to tell you. Okay, so everything I thought I was adding to the gala, the snow machine, the coloured lights, everything we talked about, we're not doing any of it? Jake, I am sorry, but Mrs. Fulton is very particular. Which is fine, I mean they're paying for it, it should be what they want. I don't understand why you didn't tell me. Well, I... I didn't want you to feel like- Like I wasn't being taken seriously? Uh. Jake, I... [sighs] Aren't you getting ready for the party at the fire station tonight? Party? I thought you were watching everything. Didn't you see what just happened with Jake? Jake will be fine. No, but you have to go to the party. It's very important. I don't even know if he wants me there. And even if he did, I don't think I could face him. Trust me. Things have a way of working themselves out. Do they? Because I finally started believing... in Jake, and my photography and my dad. Honey, that's wonderful. And for what? Jake may not even be the one for me. I can't go to that party and the gala was almost ruined and my dad might even miss Christmas with me. I just thought that this was going to be such a good holiday this year. It can. You just have to have faith. Ooooh! I wish you would stop saying that! Look, Charlie, I am having a hard time believing that anyone is sending any sleighs for me. I am here for you. Well then do something. Please. Just work your magic or your miracles. Noelle, taking leaps of faith means accepting that you don't always land exactly where you want to, but believing that you are still better than where you were. But I was fine before you showed up. You know, it might not have been the dream job, and perfect life, but I was content. I was comfortable. Well, Noelle, maybe God doesn't want us to just be comfortable. Maybe we shouldn't just settle for being content. Nothing worth having comes without risk. Yeah, but every time I risk, I just wind up disappointed. And I am so tired of being disappointed. I just wish you never even... [sighs] I didn't mean... I'm so-- Oh. I'm sorry. Charlie! Charlie? Charlie? Siizing to, well, thin air I guess. I don't know if she heard me. I'm sure she did. And what about Jake? I called him, got his voicemail, I didn't know what to say. Well, look at the bright side. The gala is in a few hours and that is going to be great. Oh, maybe I shouldn't go. You have to go. You're the one who put it all together. I don't know. I'll think about it. You know, I'm gonna take one last shot looking for that personnel file Alex wanted. I'll call ya later. Yes! Finally. Oh! Alex. I finally found that file. Charlene Pennymar. Oh, wonderful, thank you. This will be such a nice addition to my mother's gift. Oh, I'm sure she'll love it. I usually get her jewelry, or a sweater, but, uh, this might be a little outside of her comfort zone. Sometimes that's a good thing. Yes, it is. Oh good, there's even a picture. Oh, may I see it? Sure. She's the woman from the photo I took. Charlie DID send me another sleigh... [sighs] Hello, Charlene Pennymar. Hmph. Well, I better go pick up my mom and get to the gala. Are you sure you don't want to join us? Really, it's no trouble. We even have a dress for you. Oh, it's perfect. Thank you. You know, it's just missing one little thing. ♪ This place looks great. Oh, yeah, it, uh, turned out. Aw. You still bummed about this thing with Noelle? I am. Oh, um, I forgot to tell you. They officially offered me the Deputy Chief job. That's great news, Jake! I'm really happy for you. Thank you. Are you happy for you? I'm not sure if I'm really ready to sit behind a desk. I love being a firefighter. The excitement, the camaraderie, the family. Being part of my dad's legacy. I'm gonna miss that. Then maybe this new job isn't what you really want. Well, it's Christmas, maybe I should ask Santa for what I really need. And maybe you'll get that sign you've been looking for. Yeah. I'll keep my eyes open. Yeah. Shall we dance? Yes! ♪ ♪ You came! You look stunning! And the dress! Oh, it was a gift from Alex. I'll see you in a bit. You do look beautiful. Dad! [laughs] You wore it. Were right. Uh, you and I are all we have left. What about Aunt June? Well, it turns out the break wasn't so bad. So, she is going to come out here and spend Christmas with us. Oh, that's wonderful! Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Merry Christmas, dad. Oh, there are some people that I need to talk to so go ahead and grab a glass of champagne and I'll catch up with you. Okay, sweetie. Mrs. Fulton, Alex. Noelle. You have done wonderful work with the gala. It's perfect. Oh, good, I am so glad you're both happy. I was thinking though, perhaps your firefighter friend was right. Maybe we could stand to have a little more fun with things. Really? Really? Well, no matter how things are supposed to be, we can always choose to make them different. Yes, we can. I am so grateful for both of you and I have enjoyed my time at Fulton's so much but it's time that I go out on my own. So, I will be leaving to start my own photography business. Noelle, that's great. But we'll miss you. Well, we certainly will. But I was looking at your entries tonight in the photo contest. They are top-notch. Thank you. Fulton's would be honoured to be your first client. Wouldn't we, Alex? We definitely would. You can bring that fun, creative spirit to our spring advertising campaign. Oh, wow. That is so very generous and I would love to. Thank you! Thank you! Now you go and enjoy this wonderful party you planned. I will. I am so sorry about what I said. I should have never doubted you. Oh, don't be silly. How can you have faith if you have nothing to doubt? [laughs] I'm just so happy that two of your photos in the contest. Oh, no, I just submitted the one. Well, I guess, uh, things have a way of working themselves out. I told ya. So, what you're trying to say is if God sends me a sleigh I should get on it. Mm-hmm. And I know you will. Oh, I have something for you! Here we go. Okay now. Don't open it yet. You'll know when the right moment comes along. Thank you. It's been lovely getting to know you. You too. So, is this goodbye? Will I see you again? If you need me. [applause] Jake, I'm sorry. It's okay, I... I'm sorry too about the party, and the job. Oh, uh, the job. Did you get it? I did. And I turned it down. Really? Why? Because of you. Me? What did I do? It was the picture of me and my dad. So, what are you going to do instead? Well, I talked to the captain of our station, he wants to retire next year and he thinks that I would be a good replacement. Oh. Well, I think your dad would be very proud of you. Thank you. Would you like to dance? You know what, who cares who the "honey, I'm home" guy is. What? Never mind. I would love to dance. [shoe snaps] Oh! Oh! These were brand new. So much for our dance. Oh, um, wait here. Well, if the right guy did come along and ask you out, what would you say? I'd say, yes. Well great, 'cause there is someone I'd like you to meet. Hey, honey. I'm home. [laughs] That joke never gets old with you, does it? You know, I was the one that asked her about dating. So you could introduce her to me. Yeah, well I still met her first. And she did say that I was more handsome than you. Noelle, tell him. Noelle, ignore him. You see. You see that. My little brother gets promoted to captain of the station and now he thinks he can boss everyone around. Well, rank has its privileges. Come on, we gotta get started on dinner. Lots of people coming over. Noelle? Is everything all right? Noelle, is everything all right? What's your brother's name? The doctor? It's Will. Why? No reason. I would love to dance. [guests laughing] What's going on? Oh, just livin' a little. Merry Christmas, Noelle. Merry Christmas, Jake.
