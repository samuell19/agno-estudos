Thanks for the lift. I sure wish you were going all the way. Well, you're welcome. And, uh, I sure worry about a young girl like you out here, hitchhiking alone by herself. I'll be OK. So long. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hello, bird! Hey, Joe! Joe! Joe, I'm back here! It's me! I'll walk in with ya! How about those stewardesses? You notice that? They were really knockouts, almost every one of 'em. Drives you right up the wall, right? Right. Right. Look, Joe, like I said, I always mind my own business, but when I meet someone who's gone through the same darn thing I have, I just want to help out. I mean, that's just the way I am, do you understand? Oh, sure. Well, then listen to me, Joe. The only way to get over a bad marriage, or a breakup with anybody, is to go right out and find somebody else right away. And I mean pronto. Oh, psychiatrists will give you a lot of junk about, you know, adjusting to failure and all that kind of stuff. But don't listen to them. What I say is-- hey, get a load of that. Oh, Joe, these kids today drive you right up the wall, right? Yeah. Right, right. How long have you been divorced now Joe, you said? Well, I told you-- Three months, right? -Three months, right. -Yeah, yeah. And what have you been doing all this time? I mean, just sitting around feeling sorry for yourself, I'll bet. -No, no. Yeah? Well, then, how many women have you been out with since, uh, you busted up with what's her name? -Well, actually, I-- -How many? None. -I haven't had much time. None, right? That's right. And you know why, Joe? You know why? Because you're the sensitive type, Joe. That's it. You're sensitive. And if you don't watch yourself, you're going to end up on a psychiatrist's couch. I don't follow what you're-- Pick up a girl. Thin, dark haired brunette. Hey. Oh, take one look at that. You know, I'll bet you don't even have a date for New Year's Eve, do you? Well, I haven't met too many people out here socially yet. Oh, come on. Don't bull me, Joe. I know that you're lonely, you're unhappy, you're uptight. You're horny. Oh, now wait a minute, Fred. So why don't you just do me and yourself a favor? Pick up a girl, and check into a model. A motel? Oh, yeah. That is the magic word. You just mention the word motel, and you'll know right off if you're in or out. I travel all the time, Joe. I know what I'm talking about. Motel is the secret word. Don't play grab bag with your life, Joe. Listen, Joe, I've got something for you. A telephone number. This is a computer dating service. They've got offices in all the major cities. Don't forget, Joe. We're studs. Bulls. We can service any number of women. Live your life, and don't look back, Joe. Oh my gosh, I've gotta run. My girlfriend's going to pick me up. Well, so long, Joe, and happy new year. Well, happy new year to you, Fred. I want you to know, it's been a real pleasure meeting somebody on an airplane that you've got a genuine rapport with. So, go out and get 'em, boy. Bye bye. Bye. ANNOUNCER: Ivan Wiles, white courtesy telephone, please. Ivan Wiles, white courtesy telephone, please. Hi. Well, hello. So, you're getting off here, too? Yep. I live here. Do you? Well, I suppose they're going to have you flying new year's eve, are they? No. I'm going to be off three whole days. Really? Probably going to some big new year's eve party? No. I just want to spend a nice, quiet evening. You know, I've got a great idea. I don't know why I didn't think of it before. I could get in my car, and just drive up to-- Mr. Maroni, I'd like you to meet my husband, George. George, this is Mr. Maroni. Well, how do you do? Glad to meet you. Pleasure. Well, I hope we'll be flying together again sometime real soon. Oh, so do I. So do I. Bye. Goodbye. [music playing] Hi. Hello. Didn't you just pass me going the other way? Yeah. I was coming back to pick you up. Far out. How come you didn't pick me up the first time? Oh, I was going too fast. The roads are pretty narrow. I bet you thought I was gonna molest ya. I've never picked a girl up before. On the highway, I mean. So I'm your first experience, right? I'm Ginger Brown. Joe Maroni. How do you do? Fine. How are you? How far are you going? Colorado Springs. My old man's a sergeant in the air corps there. He's a mechanic. I haven't seen him in a couple years. How far are you going? Uh, Denver. Out of sight. Can I ride all the way with ya? Sure. One ride, all the way to Colorado Springs. I do have to stop in Sante Fe. I, uh, have some business I have to take care of. So we'll stop over. OK. More coffee? Yes, please. Uh-- no, thank you. Why couldn't I have another cup of coffee? Because coffee gives you wrinkles. Didn't you know that? No, I didn't know that. Well, did you ever see anybody with wrinkles that didn't drink a lot of coffee? I don't think so. Look over there. Look over there. See what I mean? Look at me. I don't have any wrinkles, and I don't even drink coffee. Yeah. I never thought about that. You need to think about it. [SINGING] Maraschino now, what does she know about my cherry red? So, listen, people, while I sing this song about how the food and drugs gone wrong. Well, they lied. They lied. About formaldehyde. Well, they're feeding us poison without any warning. Why, I had a bowl of maraschinos this morning, and now I do about a bag a day. Oh, I can't go on strung out this way. You don't get high. No, you just die, from eating-- That's a motel. Yes, sir. There's a motel, all right. [SINGING] Maraschino, now, what does she know about my cherry red? Well, I'll see if they've got a couple of rooms. I won't tell my mother if you won't tell yours. OK. It's a deal. It was hard enough for my mother and Daddy to accept me as a hippie, much less a kept woman. Right. Hey, Joe? Yes? Will you get adjoining rooms? Adjoining rooms? Yes, so we can talk through the connecting door. OK. -Evening. -Good evening. Like a room? Yes. As a matter of fact, I'd like two rooms. Uh-huh? That's my sister. She's, uh, traveling with me. And you'd like adjoining rooms? Adjoining rooms. Yes, um-- that'll be fine. Just fine. Well, I'm sorry to say we've only got one room left-- a unit with twin beds. I could give you a screen. This would give you and, uh, your sister a semblance of privacy. A screen? Yes. That is a thought, sir. I'll have to discuss it with my sister, naturally. Oh, naturally. Would you like to, uh, see the room? See the room? See the room. Uh-- no, on second thought, I think I'd better try somewhere else. It's the holidays, you know? Everything's filled. Yes, well, if we can't find anything else, we may be back. Thank you. Well, good luck. You're going to need it. Yeah. They only had one room. Did it have twin beds? Well, yeah. Why? Well, remember that old movie? What, about twin beds? Yeah, with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert? I saw it on the late show once. "It Happened One Night." Yeah, that's it. Well, why don't we do it like they did? Like what? We could pose as man and wife, and get a rope and a blanket, and make a barrier between the beds. Rope and a blanket? Yeah, wouldn't it be a gas? As long as you don't have a toy trumpet, I'm safe. A toy trumpet? Don't you remember at the end of the movie, when Gable blew on the trumpet and the walls of Jericho came tumbling down? Yes, I remember that. Where to now? Is it too late for dinner? You don't pass up a meal just cause of what the clock says. Right. Two for dinner? Yes, please. Which way to the ladies' room? Top of the stairs to the right, miss. Thank you. You try to behave while I'm gone, will ya? Yes, I'll try. MAN: This way, please. Can I help you? This way, please. Wow. Who are you? I'm Ginger Brown, from Miss Goldbrick's School of Pedigreed Young Ladies. You look lovely. Thank you. Shall we dine? I could eat a horse. I don't know if they serve horse on the menu, madame, but if not, we'll certainly send out for one. May I take your drink orders? No thank you. Scotch and soda, please. Right. Thank you. Can I have anything I want? Why not? Far out. Joe? Hm? Are you married? No. At least, not anymore. Why do you ask? Your wedding ring. Why don't you take it off? It might make you feel better. Thank you. That looks good. What are you doing? You know what this is? Whipped cream. Wrong. It's all synthetic. Didn't you ever read on the can what's in this stuff? I never-- You should. There's not anything in here that ever came close to a cow. Well, they won't kill you with it. Not the point. The point is you are what you eat. Right. Ah, no coffee. Thank you. Want some of this? No, thank you. A fella I met on the plane today said that after a divorce, you should go out and have a-- a lot of affairs. What do you think about that? Sure, if you're that kind of guy. But I dont' think you're that kind of guy. Hasn't there been anybody-- I mean, since you and Marcy busted up? Oh. Well, that's-- no. You wanna see a picture of Clayton? Sure. Looks like John the Baptist, doesn't he? Very handsome. Beard, and all. Well, is he a-- a good guy? Yeah. One of the best. How about Marcy? Was she pretty? Here. Here's a picture of her. Wow. We've got a couple of terrific hang ups. No wonder you keep her picture. She probably keeps you warm on cold nights. No. Cold nights now, I just sit by the fire. Hey, they have one in there. Come on. What a great room. Uh, Clayton? Oh. One day I'm gonna have a private ceremony and burn this picture. My mother's Irish, and my father was Italian. Mother felt that since Marcy wasn't Irish, Italian, or Catholic, that's why the marriage failed. To her it was that simple. What kind of a guy is Clayton? Crusader. Which is OK. I mean, I'm against a lot of things, man. A lot of things. But he's going to get his head busted in, or he's going to end up in jail before he's 30. I just don't dig violence, in any form. If I'm gonna throw a bomb, it's gonna be a love bomb. And if I'm going to trip out, it's going to be a love trip. You know what I mean? I think so. I still have faith in my fellow human beings, and so far, I'm right. Well, so far. It's really weird, though. People are more afraid of love than hate. And love's so much stronger than hate or violence. It's just a lot harder to come by. I guess that's true. What's this? A surprise. Thank you. What's it called? It's called Irish Coffee. You know what I told you about coffee? It's just a name. I mean, a fog cutter doesn't have fog in it, does it? Give it a try. Tastes pretty good. I think this has booze in it. By golly, I think you're right. Just take a gulp of that, man. Fantastic. Do you know what's wrong with this country? No. What's wrong with this country? No exercise. People just stuff themselves, and then they plop down in front of their TV set, or they just go right off to bed. It's a serious national problem. No doubt about it. -Yeah. People should run, walk, or jog right after every meal. Right. Right after? Yeah, right after. I like to run. You want to? -Now? -Yeah, right now. Yeah, OK. On your mark, get set, go! Now, wait. Wait! All right. Hut, two, three, four! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Hold it. Hold it. Oh-- hey. That's really something. I feel 100% worse than I did when I started. Oh, you. Hey. I just remembered something. How could I be so stupid? I've got a friend who lives here in Santa Fe. He's got a place here. -Far out. Yeah. Can we stay with him? Well, no. I mean, yeah. He, uh-- he left me the key at his store, and, uh, he's away for the holidays. Oh. Yeah. Said if I was passing through, I could stay at his place. Imagine, me forgetting a thing like that. Imagine. Can I ask you a question? Sure. What are we sitting here freezing for? I don't know. I'll pick up the keys and be right back. Good evening. Good evening. I'd like to wish you a-- a very happy new year. Happy new year to you, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. Your friend lives here? God. This is his house? Oh, it's just a duplex apartment. He rents half of it. Out of sight. Bless you. What do you expect, running around a parking lot in freezing weather? It's cold in here. Come on, I'll start a fire. OK. And to think we were sweating out a motel room. That's really weird. Yeah, I can't imagine what I was thinking. Gesundheit. Gotta get a fire started. Look at all the mail this guy gets. I'll take care of that. Take a look around. Make yourself at home. OK. Hey, this guy's very artistic. I'd like to meet him. You would? Yeah. Hey, this picture has your name on it. Uh, this fella is very fond of my work. All these paintings have your name on 'em. Well, he's, uh-- he's very fond of my work. Joe. Sometimes people play games with people. You're too much. You're a different kind of cat. I swear, I never met anybody like you before. Well, that's, uh, a vanishing breed. You're beautiful. You really are beautiful. Would you believe that nobody ever told me that before? Nobody ever told me that either. Join the club. [laughter] [sneeze] Gesundheit. What are you doing? I'm taking off your shoes. Taking off my shoes? Do you have any Vicks VapoRub? Well, yeah, I think so. Why? I'm going to give you a foot bath and rub your chest. You are? Yeah, I am. Well, look, I don't think I got a cold exactly. It's my sinuses. After 10 years in New York, they just can't get used to the shock of clean air. [sneeze] Bless you. Either that, or I'm allergic to that damn Christmas tree. GINGER: I never saw a brown Christmas tree before. JOE: Brown, yeah, well, it's brown because it's dead. I bought it the day after Thanksgiving. GINGER: You're kidding. JOE: It was a lousy Thanksgiving. I thought it might cheer me up. This year I was going to have a really great New Year's. I was going to spend it with my old buddy, Charlie McClain. But I called his ranch in Texas, and they said he'd gone down to Mexico. What kind of guy is Charlie? Charlie? That's a picture of the two of us. We were in Korea together. You didn't kill anybody, did you? Me? No. No. I don't think so. Well, Charlie and I were two of the biggest goofballs in the whole outfit. There's never a dull moment when old Charlie's around. I mean, it's wild. It's really wild. One day I'd like you to meet old Charlie. Mr. McClain, this is highly irregular. Well, I just wanted to wish you a Happy New Year properly. Well, you wouldn't want me to lose my job, would you now? Oh, of course not. And don't you worry your sweet little head about it. Say, how would you like to come with me and meet my best pal? I'm sorry. We're leaving for Albuquerque in 10 minutes. Doggone the luck. He's going to be awful disappointed. Well, next time, OK? -Oh, we'll see. Now, Happy New Year. Yeah, same to you, honey. Oh! And put this on my bill, will you? Thank you, sweetheart. Man, does this feel good. Hey! Do you mind if I wash out a few things? JOE: You do anything you want! How long have you lived here? JOE: I just moved out from New York about three months ago. GINGER: Why Santa Fe? Well, it's beautiful country. I always wanted to live here. You sure dig Indians, don't you? Navajo. A fantastic people! The language is very poetic. Do you know, they got the same word for hope and love? Hard rain is masculine rain. And gentle rain is feminine. Hey, that's far out. You know, I'm a poet. I write songs and poems. I never knew a real poet before! That's just about all I have in my suitcase. Hey, very nice. Thanks for the loan. My pleasure. [inhales deeply] Oh, very nice. Very nice. You should open a clinic. You're very good at this. I got to pay for my supper, don't I? Right, right. Towel please. What is that? Oh, it's a project of mine. It's a model of a new type of city I've been working on. Tell me about it. JOE: Well, I believe, as most of our greater architects do, that cities are dead and dying. And to just keep building new buildings on top of the ruins is not the answer. So what is the Answer Lifestyles and structures that enhance nature instead destroying it. That's terrific. Have you told anybody about it? I mean, I bet the president or the governor or Congress or somebody, would like to hear about it. Well, it's not a new or original idea. I mean, everybody-- Who cares? It's important. It's necessary. You gotta promise me you'll do something about it. OK. I promise. I think somebody made you up. You know, for a backward cat, you say a lot of heavy things. Joe? Hmm? Let's have a ceremony. What ceremony? Burn the photographs. Good idea. Goodbye, Clayton. Goodbye, Marci. nine years, up in smoke. What are you doing New Years Eve? Nothing. What are you doing? I'd like to stay here, spend it with you. You know what? What? I'm going to start picking up lady hitchhikers regularly. Do you know, when I said I wanted to stay here with ya, I meant with you. I just want to make that clear. Because-- I know, I know. I'm a little slow. And we'd waste an awful lot of time. Yeah. Yeah. I need you. I dig you. I think you dig me. I dig you a lot. The saddest thing is to wake up and there's nobody. Yeah. So we'll just spend a couple of lovely days and nights together and then I'll split. OK. You're not sure? Oh no, I'm sure. Good. Now, I'm going to go upstairs and get on some clothes and get some things for breakfast. Is that little market open? Yeah, till midnight. Look, I can go! GINGER: Nuh-uh! But I'll need some bread for groceries! Bread for groceries? Right. Bread! Bread for groceries. Right. [laughter] I'm gonna fix you a breakfast you'll never forget! JOE: Hey! Don't you run out on me. Don't worry. Uh, remember-- I've got your suitcase, with all your paperbacks and your poems. I'll be damned. I'll be damned. My, that's sure pretty. You people sure know how to decorate a town. Gracias, senor. [singing to self] I want to take a bath. I'm gonna take a bath. [singing to self] [water running] [music - "joy to the world"] [bell ringing] [doorbell] [country music playing] Charlie? [laughter] You old son of a gun! Oh boy! It's good to see you! It's really good to see you! Yeah, Charlie-- I come in on a champagne flight. I come all the way Mexico to celebrate New Year's Eve with ya! Charlie! Well, I surprised the fire out of you, didn't I? Yeah, you sure did. You certainly have. [laughter] Hey, don't you smell purty. Yeah, well, I- You wasn't expecting me, was you? No, as a matter of fact, I wasn't, you old Texas rat. [laughter] Uh-- Charlie-- Boy, you're looking good. You know that? You are looking good! Yeah, well, why didn't you give me a call, let me know you were coming? What? Waste good money on phone calls when you could spend it on booze and women? You got to be kidding! Hey, look at this place you got here. You living out here like a high doggone, son. Look at all them candles. What you having here, an Irish wake? Charlie, there's something I got to tell you. Excuse me a minute. Hey! Salvador! Mi amigo's in la casa. So bring in those bags muy pronto! SALVADOR: Si, senor! I got all the bags! Hey, Charlie-- And don't rupture yourself, son! Bring 'em in one at a time! No, wait a minute. Charlie, I got to explain something to you. -What's that? -What? What? What? Sounds like Niagara Falls. Niagra-- oh, good grief. Oh! [laughter] Charlie-- You old rapscallion, you. You got a little dolly here somewhere, haven't you? Where you got her hid, boy? Now, look, she went to the market. Charlie-- Oh my goodness, she must be getting awful cold without her little things on. Charlie, it's not the way you think. Tiny little rascal, ain't she? Yeah, but-- Charlie, it's not the way you think. Well, listen, I'm as happy as a clam about it. And I'm not going to get in the way, either. I'll just sneak out to the picture show or someplace soon as she turns up. SALVADOR: Hey! Senor! I got all these bags! Oh, the bags. Charlie! Hey! Salvador, you're liable to sprain something, son! Not very big, but I'm very strong. Just put those bags down there anywhere, boy. You know what, Charlie, wait, please. Hey, Salvador, I'd like you to meet mi compadre here. Jose Marone. Joe, this is Salvador Rodriguez. -Very nice to meet you. He drove me all the way here from the airport. Very good. Thank you, Salvador. Charlie, just-- Salvador, this is mi amigo grande, Jose Marone. Very pleased. Very pleased to meet you, Salvador. Charlie, will you listen to me please? Hey, sit down there, boy. Take a load off your feet and have some of this champagne. No, Char-- fellas, wait a minute. Hey, gracias. You're really nice fellas. Charlie, will you listen to me for just a second?! Now, look, you've got to clear out of here with all this stuff. And your friend too. It's nothing personal, Salvador. And you too, Charlie. You got to clear out right now. Look, I already told you, I'm going to clear out. And then I'll sneak back in here, quiet as a little mouse. And I'll crash out on the couch up there. No, Charlie-- Charlie-- that's not going to work. Look, if you think I'm going back out in this Blue Norther, boy, you're crazy. That's exactly what you're going to have to do. Hey, I don't get this. I don't get this at all. Do I send you to a hotel when you come down home to visit me? Huh? No, no, Charlie. And I'm just as sorry as I could be. But this is a very special thing, Charlie. And I'll explain it all later. Well, I'm not going to interfere. Shucks, maybe she's got a girlfriend she can fix me up with. I'm human too, you know? Right, Salvador? [laughter] Hey, very nice fellas. Gracias, amigo. Gracia-- Charlie, will you pay attention, please? Now, this is not some broad coming up here. Charlie, this is a very lovely, a very sweet, a very young girl. And you're going to louse up the whole deal unless you leave right now. Hey, wait a minute. You haven't gone and fallen in love with somebody, have you? Oh, no, Charlie. You just got yourself out of nine years of bondage, boy. Stay out! -Right. Charlie, you don't know the girl. You don't know the situation. I don't have to know the girl or the situ-- Charlie! Listen to me! Please! -Will you stop that? You're giving me a headache. Charlie. I picked this girl up on the highway a few hours ago. She's a hippie, hitchhiker. You're putting me on. No, no, I'm not. CHARLIE: Picked up a hippie hitchhiker? I don't believe it. Well, it's true, OK, I'm a little desperate. Huh? Hey, look, Charlie, I been without a woman for three months. Oh, you poor boy! Yeah. No wonder you're looking so wall eyed and jumpy. Well-- CHARLIE: You think she's a sure thing? JOE: Sure thing? Sure! She's a sure thing. Charlie, she already asked me. She asked you? Sure! Well, man, you got yourself a real hot number! That's right! A real hot number! Now, Charlie, will you clear out and just give me a call a little later. -Ooh, come on, Salvador. Let's vamanos, boy. Come on. Hi, honey. Joe was just telling me some lovely things about you. I heard. Uh-- Ginger, this is my old buddy, Charlie. I know. Uh, Ginger, this is Salvador Rodriguez. Uh-- let me take those things. Honey, uh, Salvador and me's just going. I'm staying over here at the hotel. Then why'd you bring your bags up? My bags? Oh, oh, oh, my bags. Well, I almost forgot. I brought Joe and you too, honey, some fresh homemade country smoked deer meat sausage. I can't wait for y'all to see these sausages. Why don't you just pay the driver, Charlie? What about my hotel? Why don't you just pay the driver and let him split? There's about half a dozen ways out of this situation. And we didn't seem to hit on a-one of them. If you'll wait a minute, you can drop me at the bus station. Ginger-- here's your change. And uh, thanks for the ride. Now you see what you've done? Look, I'll fix this up in no time. Oh, you already fixed it. If she leaves you because if you, old buddy, that's it. We're through. kaput, finished, count on it. Hold this. Salvador? You got to split, old buddy. Hey, senor, but the senorita. Never mind the senorita. I'll explain it to you later. [spanish]. Uh-- you keep the champagne. It's a present. Gracias. Happy New Year! Yeah, happy New Year to you too. Same to you! [music playing] No, it's your fault. Shh. Shh. GINGER: Where's the cab driver? CHARLIE: Oh, he had to split, honey. He was double parked. -Thanks a lot. Then I'll just walk. -No, no, no, no, no. Now, wait. No wait. Look, honey. This is all my fault. -No it's not. It's my fault. I asked for it. Ginger, wait. I-- I don't know what you heard. But I promise you-- Promise me what? That you'll take something beautiful and make it ugly? A sure thing you picked up on the road? A hot number? Now see what you've done? Don't blame him. It's you. You just stood there. At least Charlie tried. You tried and he had to lie. I won't forget that, Charlie. Honey, what are friends for? This is absolutely ridiculous. I don't believe it. This is all going to come out in the wash. Charlie, will you knock it off? Now, you've done enough damage for one day. What do you keep yelling at Charlie for? Does it help anything to keep yelling at him? She's right, Joe. I'm just a victim of circumstance. You? Now, wait a minute! I'm the victim. I'm already convicted. I didn't even get a trial. Why did you have to saw all those awful things? Because I was desperate. Because it's the only kind of language this drunken bum understands. Well, now, that hurt, boy. That really did. Did you know that today was the most beautiful day of my whole life? I believed you. And to think that all I was to you was just a little-- Oh my god. CHARLIE: Look, I just met you. But from what Joe tells me, and from what I can see with my very own eyes, I know you're just the sweetest, most decent kind of a little girl that any lucky man would ever hope to meet. Thank you. That's very sweet. It's incredible. Shh. Now, Everything. Is going to be hunky dory. Just remember, I'm part of the family. And the thing that you think is so awful now is going to seem just like angel food cake tomorrow morning. -Everything is ruined. No, no, now it's not. Now, look, you just go in the bedroom there. And you go to bed. And Joe and me are going to stay out here. Aren't we, Joe? We all go to sleep on this thing. And tomorrow it's going to turn out just fine. Got to go. Joe, ask her nice, to stay. Ginger, please stay? Please. Come on, honey. I'll stay if you'll stay, Charlie. Well, if that's what you want. And don't worry. I won't contaminate your bed. I'll sleep on the floor. That is the silliest damn thing I've ever heard! Easy, boy, now, easy. Now, you just go on in there to sleepy pie. Don't worry. I'll leave first thing in the morning. No, sir. Tomorrow we gonna just love each other to pieces and bring in that baby New Year. You really are a groovy guy, Charlie. CHARLIE: Tomorrow, when I'm sober, you won't be able to stand me. GINGER: Not a chance. Goodnight, honey. Goodnight. Psst. Um-- goodnight. Goodnight. Everything is possible through faith. Is your insurance paid up? Well, now, that's gratitude for you. I just averted a disaster here. There's no justice. Charlie, are you planning to flop here indefinitely? You know you're just a bundle of nerves. Answer the question. I forgot what it was. Are you going or aren't you? Well, I don't see how I can. I promised that sweet little thing there I'd stay. I can't leave for your sake. Child, old buddy, our friendship has survived some incredible tests over the years. But this one-- this one tops them all. And I swear, I'm going to get you for this if it's the last thing I ever do. You're just disappointed. That's why you're saying ugly things you don't mean. What is this thing? What the hell does it look like? It's a Christmas tree. Well, it's not anymore. It's now an incendiary bomb. Charlie, will you get out of here so I can think up a way to clear up this mess? You better just cool it for awhile, old buddy. What a mess. What a ridiculous mess. If it'll make you feel any better, I'll tell you some of my problems. Oh, Charlie-- It always makes me feel a whole lot better to find out somebody else is in worse shape than I am. You want to know how I spent my Christmas? Not particularly. I spent my Christmas all alone with just my old dog and a couple of drunk cowboys. Santa Clause didn't bring me nothing but a big old sack of heartache. Charlie-- CHARLIE: Maybe I wasn't a model husband, Joe. I'll admit that. But I was a darn good father. And I love those kids, Joe, and I miss 'em. Shucks, on cold winter nights like this, I even miss old Sugar. Oh my god. You don't care what's happening to me, do you? Charlie, will you please go so I can think? Joe, I think it's high time I told you about my discovery. Your discovery? Do you know what least 85% of the joy derived from sex is? Now, look, I figured this out all by myself. But I am certain that science will bear me out. 85% of the joy derived from sex is nothing in the world but anticipation. Jesus. Now, don't you realize that the longer you prolong this thing, the finer it's going to be when it finally happens? Charlie, I'm warning you, go to a hotel now. No, actually, I'm a blessing in disguise. Well, if you weren't drunk, I'd clobber you. Do you honestly believe that this temporary little setback with that precious little thing in there is going to end your romance? Why, no, boy. It's just going to make it all better. Charlie-- Because anticipation is going right to work. I don't believe this. I don't believe it. Look, don't you realize that she's all curled up in there right now, in your bed, just throbbing and pulsating with love for you? I'm warning you, Charlie, that's enough. I just tingle all over when I think about it. I'm warning you, Charlie. Do you think all this powerful love is going to waste? Why, no, boy! It's just getting all stored up minute by minute and hour by hour. Charlie, I'm warning you-- Just building a growing and warming and throbbing. JOE: Charlie-- And when y'all finally do get together, powee! Whoopee! Yoo-hoo! You bastard. Ow! What's going on? Are y'all trying to kill each other? Charlie, why? Why did you have to come here now, of all times? Don't you know, boy? I'm lonely. [CRYING] I just had to be with somebody on New Year's Eve who cares about me. Charlie. ANNOUNCER: Texas International, Flight 57, now arriving, Gate 5A. [planes landing] [snoring] [phone rings] Morning, buddy. Morning. Hello? Joe? JOE: Yeah. Hey, Joe. Sugar here. Well, hello. Hey, this is a surprise. Where are you? Albuquerque. I got a half-hour layover here. So I thought I'd just call and wish you a happy New Year. Well, a Happy New Year to you too. Kids and I were in Honolulu for Christmas. And I sent them on ahead to stay with mother in Dallas for a few days. And hey, well, Joe, darling, how are you? I missed you. Oh, and I've missed you too honey. Say, have you heard from our old friend lately? Uh-- if you mean my darling ex, the wandering mud king, no. He hasn't paid his child support in over five months. I'd sure like to lay my hands on him. You know, it's funny you should say that. It's funny you should say that. Charles-- is there with you? That's right. Look, honey, would you hold on for just a second? I'm going to take this in the other room. Don't hang up. Who's that? An old friend. [door closes] I wonder who that was. It hope it was a girl. Heard him call somebody honey. After breakfast, I better split. Nothing doing. You're not going anywhere. JOE: I'll see you later. Hey, where you going? Oh, out for a little while. Well, wait a minute. That's not very hospitable. You got company here. Well, you two seem to get along just fine. I won't be here when you get back. So goodbye. Now, wait a minute. We got a date tonight, regardless of how you feel about me. You got to keep it. I mean, fair is fair. Well, what about me? Somebody's got to fix me up with somebody. I'm working on that right now, old buddy. As a matter of fact, I may have you fixed up one of those real hot numbers you like. -Yeah? -Yeah. Here's a little souvenir from the islands. Oh, thank you, ma'am. Oh, Sugar, I can't tell you how much appreciate you doing this. Are you kidding? After what that so-and-so's done to me, I wouldn't miss a chance like this for all the leis in Honolulu. You're one heck of a fine cook, honey. You know that? If I was around you for long, I'd be as big as a barn. You really like it? Mhm. But you didn't eat nothing, hardly. Well, I'm not very hungry. Oh, darling, don't you know that things between men and women never end abruptly like this? They just usually fizzle out. What's on your mind, honey? Well, I got to tell somebody. Well, I'm somebody. I'm going to have a baby. Oh. How is he, Joe? Still drinking? Well, he's uh-- yeah, he's still drinking. Well, if you left him with this girl you picked up, all I can say is lots of luck. Oh come on, Sugar. Now, Charlie's got his bad points. But he wouldn't try anything like that. Want to put some money on it? No. [laughter] Are you serious? Absolutely. Things don't work out between you and Joe, I'll marry you and give that little shaver of yours a good name. You're crazy. You don't even know me. You're an exceptionally fine little woman. And I don't care if the kid is mine or not. A kid is a kid. That's far out, Charlie. But I guess I just better go this alone. And don't say anything to Joe about it. OK? You're something else. You know that? Charlie, let's make tonight special, OK? How come? I don't know. It's just important to me. Whatever you say, kid. Gimme give. JOE: Hey, Charlie. Here's that red-hot number I promised you. Hello, Charlie. Well now, how about that? Isn't this a lovely surprise? [mariachi music] Good evening, Russell. Oh, Mr. Marone, I have your table right here, sir. Good. Excuse me, sir. Mhm. Thank you, Russell. Well, what would everybody like to drink? Well, it's New Year's Eve. Let's celebrate. A whole bottle of champagne. Waiter, a whole Mag-um. Why don't you stick with what you've been drinking, Charlie? And it's pronounced Mag-num. I don't care if it's pronounced Boxcar. We want the biggest bottle you got. Yes, sir. For a man who was dying of loneliness less than two hours ago, you've made a remarkable recovery, Charlie. Well, why not? Being reunited with my darling Sugar and meeting little Ginger here, and discovering that my best pal that has this delightful sadistic streak, that's enough to rekindle the spirits of any man. Paper hats? Oh my, what fun. Charlie, since you're the mud king, you get to wear the crown. You know it, baby. And Diamond Lil, here's a little dunce cap for you, darling. Thank you, darling. Your thoughtful nature is something I've really missed. Have you now? You're looking good, Sugar, baby. You've put on a little weight, didn't you, honey? That Italian boyfriend of yours must be feeding you lots of spaghetti and macaroni and stuff. How did you know about him? Oh, society columns. That's the way I keep up with you and my kids these days. Why don't we dance? Oh, let's see if Charlie can stand up first. Oh, no, wait! Let's have a champagne first. Hey, wait, let me do this. I'm an expert at this. You got to watch out though. There's the thing. Ow! Woo-hoo-hoo! Saludos, amigos! Oh, Happy New Year! That's a little toast here. Happy New Year. Captain? Sir? I'd like to buy a round of mariachis for the margarita band. They look parched. Yes, sir. God love you. Ginger, would you like to dance? GINGER: Sure. Mm. Oh, well, oh, hey! Sugar, baby, shall we trip the light fantastic? We shall trip, I can promise you that. Oh, you are a darling thing, aren't you? Come on. Oops, watch that. [mariachi music] You're not mad anymore? No, I don't stay mad long. I'm sorry the way things-- and if Charlie hadn't arrived, maybe-- I'm glad he did. I learned some things. Ginger, you know I didn't mean what I said. Or even what you thought I might have said. Tonight's a fun night, OK? Tomorrow I'll split, no problems. You feel might good, Sugar, baby. Mighty good. SUGAR: Do I? Mhm. How can you tell the difference between all us girls, anyway? Oh, I can tell. How's little Joe, Peggy Sue? They're fine. They had a nice Christmas. They loved your presents. Good. Good. Tell me about your dress designer. That's really none of your business, Charlie. Oh, I think it is, if he's going to be my kids' new daddy. Where'd you hear that? Gossip columns. Well, I-- I really don't care to discuss it. Well, I think we better. If he's going to try to fill my shoes, I think we better. Charlie, let's sit down before you fall down. I'll tell you what, let's change partners. I want to dance. Come on. Excuse me. [guests chattering indistinctly] [mariachi music] [cheering] [applause] CHARLIE: Hey! That's swell! Woo! Anyhow-- anyhow, I could sell out and have a little money left to go in on a ranch down in Sonora. And I want you to come in with me. A ranch? Yeah. Hell, Charlie, I don't know one end of a cow from the other. Oh, Joe, you learn ranching in no time. And it's beautiful down there, man. It's wild and beautiful. We could live like kings down there. Charlie's a barrel of laughs, huh? Well, you just try living with a barrel of laughs, honey. [noisemaker] I'm still in the mud business anyway. And I'm moving to Mexico. SUGAR: You're not selling anything, buster. That company belongs to me. Well, listen, we better get out fast before you end up with a big old half of nothing. SUGAR: You're drunk, Charlie. You don't know what you're talking about. Well, why don't you just come and take a look at the books, mamacita? You watch your language! What'd I say? I didn't say nothing. Look, we're trying to have a party. OK? -I'm having fun. Hey, man, will you pour me another glass of champagne? Oh, she's had enough, Charlie. Oh, give a little lady a drink! SUGAR: And why don't you go to the restroom, wash your face, and comb your hair. you look like the wild man from Borneo. And why don't you go on a diet? You look like a fat lady in a sideshow. Oh! [women shriek] Oh my goat! My leg is broke! -Charlie-- I think she broke my doggone leg. Oh! -Mr. Marone-- -Not now, Russell. -Mr. Marone-- Ginger, get your wrap, will you? Mr. Marone-- Yes, I know, we're going. I hate to say this. But I'm afraid you and your people are going to have to take a more secluded table. Just bring us the check please. That won't be necessary. I'll mail it to you. Thank you. I'll like a check. We got to get a doctor. Come on, Charlie. Thank you, Russell. Well, I don't care if I am crippled. I'm clearing out and I'm going to Mexico. You can go to Timbuktu as far as I'm concerned. But you're not selling the mud business. Well, this is the first time I've ever been kicked out of a restaurant. Falling-down drunk. Falling-down drunk? I was kicked over! And you have turned into an alcoholic. Oh, shut up! I divorced you to stop you from bugging me. So stop bugging me! This is turning out to be one of the truly great New Year's Eve parties. SUGAR: Pay up! No I am not. Not a nickel till I can see my kids any time I want to see them! That's not what the judge said. You know what you can do with the judge, honey! You don't need my money! It's spite! Pure spite! That's all it is! You have a responsibility, Charlie. They are your kids! They are not my kids! Not anymore! And the next time your old lady or that precious daddy of yours won't let me see 'em, I'm going to kidnap 'em. You just try that, and I'll have you put away so far, they'll have to feed you with a bean shoot. To one helluva party. You invited her! I didn't! Well, I'm not going to talk about it anymore. Well, good. Cause I don't want to talk about it either. Why aren't you out at some cheap honky-tonk with one of your car hops or your cocktail waitresses? Any car hop I know is a better woman than you are, sweetheart! Male menopause, that's what's the matter with you. No other woman ever locked me out of her bedroom but you, sweetheart. -Oh! Well, that's because they were cheap and I had pride. I wasn't about to compete with every ticky-tail car hop in the whole country. I gave you 10 wonderful years! No, you gave me about two, actually. Then you went frigid on me. There are no frigid women, Charles, only clumsy, selfish men. Did your psychiatrist tell you that? You caused me to go to on. You did it, with all you're catting around. Oh, bull, bull, bull! I never catted around! You locked me out. Lie! Lie! Lie! Using your sex like a door prize. If I didn't jump every time you said, jump, hit the lock, baby. O-U-T, out. That is a bald-faced lie. No, it ain't! Other things become more important to you than me. Your social work, your political causes, activities! You didn't have time for me! You stopped being a woman and turned into a machine! Well, when you did, you turned me out to pasture, honey! Well, I pastured. Let me tell you! I pastured! SUGAR: I hate you. I hope everybody's having a good time. And I hope you rot in hell. Well, I ain't. Not just anyway. Because I'm going to Mexico. And if Joe doesn't marry little Ginger here, I will, and give that little shaver of hers a good name and teach him to grow up like a man! That's what I'm going to do! Little shaver? Charlie-- Sorry, honey. Going to find out sooner or later anyhow. You promised. What little shaver is he talking about? I'm going to have a baby in about seven-and-a-half months. You're a surprise a minute, aren't you? You know who the father is? Yes. That fella we cremated yesterday? GINGER: Yes. Does he know the child is his? Yes. He doesn't want children. He doesn't think a child should be subjected to the world the way it is today. Oh, he doesn't? Well, then he should be celibate, don't you think? Or maybe let you know about the Pill? I know about the Pill. I want this baby. What about a father? Or are you in the market for one, is that it? I mean, you're going to just keep sleeping with strange men until you find someone who-- Oh, honey, honey, let's go to the hotel. We don't have to stay here to be insulted. How can you be so dumb? Yeah, you're right. It's not every day I pick up a pregnant hitchhiker. Thanks for the swell party, fellas. And tomorrow, if I don't get my child support, I report you to the judge! Good riddance, you old bitch! Pregnant. Stupid broad. Pregnant! Dumb broad. [church bells] [horns, noisemakers] Happy New Year, Charlie. Happy New Year, Joe. [music, "auld lang syne"] Come on, let's go out and have ourselves some fun. No, Charlie, I don't feel much like it. Well, we're out of booze. What kind of New Years we going to have if we don't get some more booze? [sigh] Oh, come on. Let's go out and have ourselves some fun, even if it kills us. Why not? [BOISTEROUSLY SINGING IN SPANISH] Home! [singing] Hey! [speaking spanish] Ah. That's beautiful. That's beautiful. Fantastic. Very pretty. Very pretty. Beautiful. Joe? Joe? Yeah? Do you know what old Lot said to his wife when he looked back and saw that she had turned into a pillar of salt? No, what did old Lot say about his wife's salt? He said, honey, I sure hate to tell you this, but you have turned into a pillar of salt. That's a joke? That's it. [laughter] Oh my goodness! look at the bell! Somebody forgot to decorate the bell! Oh, that's terrible. Awful. Well, hey, it is. Let's decorate it for them. Want to? -No, no. -No, come on, let's do it. Get a little nearer. JOE: No nearer. Stay there. CHARLIE: Come on, get a little nearer. Ah. [laughter] Got one? Got it. All right, put yours over there. And I'll put mine up yonder. Hey, sir, could you hold this for me, please? Thank you. Some women like old Sugar, should be belted every now and then. Who you think you're kidding? Sugar is tougher, meaner than you and me put together. You never laid a hand on her. I did so. I knocked the fire out of her once. What'd you hit her with? That, old buddy. Right smack on the jaw. She saw stars for a week. Yeah? Yeah. She danced around, yelling like a banshee. Thought I'd killed her. It was lovely. [laughter] What'd she do then? Huh? What'd she do then? Oh. Well, she uh, naturally hit me back. What'd she hit you with? A golf club. Gold club? A number nine iron. Right across the top of my head. She almost fractured my dad-blamed skull. [laughter] I don't see why it's so doggone funny. [laughter] Took seven stitches in my scalp. Look at that. would you look at that? You came that close to losing the best pal you ever had. [laughter] Ma'am, look. Look at those boys over there. They're drinking the liquor in this park. Oh. Now, that's against the law. God bless America! Help us and save us. -Amen. -Uh-oh. Hmm? [tires squeal] JOE: Here come the fuzz. Her come the fuzz. Here come the fuzz. Here come the fuzz! All right, stop right there, in the name of the law. Now, get your hands up. Come on, get 'em up a little higher. SHERIFF: Everett! Everett! Put that dad-blamed gun away. Why don't you go over yonder and straighten out them luminarias? I'll handle this. All right, boys. Officer, this may not seem to appear what it is underneath. No way, you see. I think that you boys better come along with me. Woo. [singing] Shh. You trying to wake up everybody in town? No, sir. No, sir. You boys sure had it rough. I'm just sorry that I had to spoil your fun. Why, I'd be the last person in the world to throw a couple of war veterans in jail on New Year's Eve. It's all right, Captain. You were just doing your job. We haven't seen each other since the prison camp in Korea. Yeah. I just got over my amnesia and they sent me off to Vietnam. I sure feel sorry for you fellas. You sure had it rough. Yes we have. Would you like to see where I got it in the leg? That's terrible, Captain. You don't want to see it. Oh, no thanks. No thanks. I-- I'm just sorry that I had to do what I had to do, that's all. It's all right, sir. You're just like us. Duty comes first. Duty first, captain. Look, boys, will you do me a favor? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Just stay inside. Huh? Yes, sir. [singing] [singing loudly] [rooster crows] You know who I really miss? Who? Les Paul and Mary Ford. Pregnant. Pregnant. The world's becoming feminized. RIght. Right. Men have got to take over, stop this pussyfooting around. Right. -Damn. -Hmm? I got an idea. What? Let's go out in the streets and get this whole movement started. Right. Shake the complacent bastards into action. Right! But first let's get something to eat. I'm starved. My head hurts. Huevos rancheros. That's what you need. Fix you right up. Oh, God, I hope so. Come on. [sigh] Coffee gives you wrinkles? Hmm? Wrinkles. -Wrinkles? -Mhm. It's a fact. Hmm. Hey, Joe, you can't eat that without hot sauce, boy. Here. Whoa. That'll fix you right up there. Ain't it good? Mm. You know the trouble with that? We're like the old boll weevil, just looking for a home. Mm. Ah. My dad built up a business from scratch, from nothing. Since he's been gone, I just watched it dwindle away. My old man was a shoemaker. They had a little shop. You know, one time, I asked him, I said, pop, what do you want in the whole wide world? You know what he said? He looked me right in the eye and he said, Joseph, I want to make a fine pair of shoes. Man, ain't that something? Isn't that beautiful? I mean, he knew that's all he really wanted. I know. Oh, I know. Boy, my dad was about 10 feet tall to me. I mean, when I was a kid, it always seemed to me he lived in a giant world among giant men and giant machinery. Never knew how to show his affection to me. Anyway, he took me on this deer hunt. With some oil men, some cronies of his. I never told you about this. We was down near Bandera and staying one cold autumn morning. When all of a sudden, this 10-point buck jumps up. He's about-- oh, about 150 yards off. My dad motioned that I should take him. Well, I shot him. At first, I thought I missed him. He run like hell about 50 yards. And then he dropped. Hmm. I shot him right through the heart. Well, my dad was pretty excited, I'll tell you. He kept yelling, great shot! Great shot, boy! Later, he's watching me skin this old buck. I was looking into the big brown eyes of this deer that'd run 50 yards with a 0.30-caliber bullet through his heart, and thinking how much grander and more beautiful he was than me. And all of a sudden, I felt my dad's hand on my shoulder. And I looked up. He had great big old tears in his eyes. He was just bustin' with pride and joy. I never seen him like that before. Well, Joe, I don't deer hunt no more. Three weeks later, my dad was dead. He dropped dead right up on the derrick floor of an oil well, right up there where he'd spent all his life. Maybe I let him down. I don't know, I guess I have. I just hope, though, that he'd understand. there I go, bawling again. Well-- [blows nose] Damn. Come on, old son. Let's take a drive up in the mountains, huh? OK. Listen, kid, you're the one who's pregnant, not I. Sugar, you're in worse shape than all of us. You're a divorced women with two kids and you're still in love with your ex-husband. And you're miserable. Well. OK. Let's assume that I'd take him back. Now, just assume, mind you. Stop assuming. Stop playing games. If you want him back, you can get him back. Just how do I got about doing that? Help him. Don't buck him. Forget your pride. Take him in your arms and tell him you dig him. Cry if you have to. Get down on your knees. Tell him you're all the awful things he says you are. Be honest. You've got to be kidding. Well, I don't know how it was with you, when you and Sugar split up. But boy, I can't make another mistake like that. I just couldn't take it. I know. I know. This girl, she's-- Charlie, she's really got to me in a different, wild kind of way. Oh, I don't know if it's because I'm on a rebound from Marci, or lonely or-- Horny? Yeah, horny. [laughter] Can't get her out of my head. I know. She's a-- she's a very special kind of a little person. Oh, she is, Charlie. She is. Man, I don't know if I can handle it. Pregnant. I wish I could help you, Joe. I really do. Yeah, sure do too. Hey, look at those kids out there. Little rascals. Yeah. Hey, let's go down there and challenge them, huh? Show 'em what real war's all about. Want to? -Oh, I don't know. Oh, come on. let's go. Come on. Come on, let's go. Come on. Hey. Hey, kids? You want to have a-- you want to have a fight with us? We going to challenge you to a fight, OK? All you kids against us. OK? OK? Listen! Wait a minute! We got to get some ammunition. Joe? Sure. You all right? Listen! Get over there! We'll get some snowballs here. OK? OK. Wait a minute! [children yelling] Get you little buggers! You little rascals! [yelling] Got you, bugger! [yelling] [music playing] Steady! Charge her! [yell] [music playing] Everett! Come back here. Leave your gun alone. Why don't you stay with the car? I'll handle this. Go get 'em! Charge! Charge! [music playing] [groaning] [breathing heavily] Oh, buddy. I think we lost that war. I think we did. [breathing heavily] [groaning] Officer, we'd like to report a mugging. Charlie? Look who's here. You invite those people? Got to be the wrong house. Must be. I got to talk to you. Charlie, I uh-- um-- been doing some uh-- thinking about uh-- us. And uh-- well, I-- I've-- I'm willing to discuss our s--s--situation, if you are. What you got up your sleeve? Oh, nothing. It's just that uh-- well, we were partners once. And I thought we could uh-- well, uh-- have a-- a meeting of the board, huh? Come on. The only time your wife invites you in the bedroom these days is for business conference. Hell, I can't even take care of myself. I didn't ask you to marry me. I just asked you to love me. Charlie? Hmm? Charlie? Hmm? Charlie-- I've been a horrible, spoiled selfish bitch. And-- And I-- I want you to forgive me and take me back. You know I picked you up for just one reason. Wanting someone isn't wrong or evil. My darling, I'll be so-- I'll be so good to you if you take me back. I'll never, never, never lock you out again. And you'll be-- you'll be too tired from loving me to even think of another woman. Oh, Charlie, please, take me back. Oh, please! Oh, I wish I had a witness to this. Sugar, honey, get up from there. What if somebody came in? Do you love me even a little bit? Oh, darling, you know I do. I never loved all those other gals. I just-- Oh, no, no, don't talk about it ever. I never loved anybody but you. Look, look at the ring. I never took that ring off. Oh, Charlie. Do you think I'm fat? Oh, no. Honey, you're just-- Do you still desire me? Oh, you know I do. Well, I-- I love you. Mm. Passionately. And I desire you passionately. And I only wish that I could prove it. Oh darling, I do, I do. You can! You can! Uh, sweetheart-- uh, not now. Uh wait. wait! I can't! I can't! Oh! Charlie! I don't believe in free love. i mean, love's not free. You have to earn it, work for it, pay for it. I believe in God. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I believe in work, all the things you people seem to hate. You don't know what I hate. I'm not a category. I'm me. And you're not a category either. I'm only sure of one thing. I don't want to hurt you. But I just don't know if I can handle you having someone else's child like this. I don't know if you can handle anything at all. Well, kids, I've decided to take old Sugar back. Yeah. Well uh, let's say, we both decided. Congratulations. Joe, boy, I've called a cab. We're going to clear out of here and let you two get acquainted. I gotta split too. Hey, what you trying to do? Make me feel bad? Can you give me a lift to the bus station? Well, sure. But-- Hey, Joe, why don't you take her, huh? Well, I'd like to, Sugar. but-- Hey, listen you two. If we can work things out after all we've been through, you all should at least get a decent start. Great! I stayed for the party. The party's over. Look, if you two are going to get married again, I'd be glad to be your best man. Well, why not? You're still my best friend. No I'm not. Hmm? I'm your only friend. Yeah. Yeah. But think how lucky we are. At least we got one friend. Bye. You take care now. -You bet. -OK. Sugar? Bye, Joseph. We'll be in touch, huh? Sure, sure. Bye. Ginger, I'd be glad to drive you to the station. Why? When something's over, it's over. I'm not good enough for you. I never said that. OK! So you're uptight! Well, who isn't? So you need some time to get your head together. Fine. But if you ever want to build one of those wonderful new cities or shake the world up at all, make it a better place for kids and people and stuff, then you just got to get it on. And the same thing goes for me. If you don't want to get involved with me, OK. But do yourself a favor. The next time somebody comes along and offers herself to you, you better take her. Because you need somebody bad. You know what hurt the most? You never even asked to read one of my poems. [music playing] You all right, kid? [music playing] GINGER [VOICEOVER]: "You're a good man, Joe Morane. And I'm a lucky girl." [phone rings] Hello? Joe? What in the world's the matter with you, boy? We left that sweet little old girl standing down there in front of the bus station, crying. Don't you know she's crazy about-- [joe hangs up] Joe? Joe? [testing the phone line] Joe? Uh, excuse me. Did you see a pretty young girl. She was wearing kind of a hairy, fuzzy coat. She was carrying a guitar and a suitcase. It was an old suitcase. Well, I'd remember a face like that. Well, I think she got on the bus to Colorado. Well, the bus to Colorado left 15, 20 minutes ago. Oh, thank you. Yeah. Captain Dieter? Oh no, not you again. Is this your car? Yes sir, it is. Captain Dieter, this is a matter of life and death. I've got to stop that northbound bus. Is that so? Yes, sir. First I let you off for disturbing the peace. Then you're illegally parked. Now you want me to help you hold up a bus? Yes, sir. Please, you see, there's a girl on that bus. And Captain, I don't know exactly what she's going. And I've got to find her. Because I've been terrible to her and I'm an idiot! Well, I'll go along with you on that. Where's that other idiot, that buddy of yours? Who, Charlie? Well, Captain, he's gone back to Texas. Well, heaven help Texas. [laughter] Please, Captain. If I don't stop the bus, I may lose the girl. And I'd sure hate to do that now. Oh, Captain, could you help an old soldier? Please? All right. Thank you. Everett, you take this car on back to the Sheriff's office and wait for us yonder, will you? Come on, get in. Keys are in it. [music playing] Driver, this old boy here has lost somebody and he thinks that maybe she's on this bus. Well, hurry up. I'm on schedule. Thank you. Ginger, I've got to talk to you. Will you get off the bus with me, please? No. Ginger, please. I've got to talk to you. It's important. PASSENGER: Fella, I got to get home. Just a minute. Ginger, please. Sheriff, she doesn't want to get off the bus. Well, what do you want me to do? Arrest her? You know, boy, she ain't a-breakin' the law. Mister, you either pay or get off the bus. Sheriff, could you lend $5? $5? You've got my car as security. Here. Thank you, Sheriff. You won't be sorry. Can I go now? I wish you would. Ginger, I'm going to stay on this until you listen to me. Ginger, I'm most stupid. I know I hurt you. I'm sorry. I want you. I want your child. You've got to believe me. You're right. I do need you. But you've got to believe me. What do you need me for? Because I love you. Because I think I need you more than I've ever needed anyone in my life. You don't even know who I am. I only know you're the most beautiful thing that ever happened to me. And I can't let you go now. DRIVER: Mister! I'll never have the chance to know who you are if you leave now! Ginger, you got to give me a chance! DRIVER: I said, stay in your seat! Just a minute. I want to hear one of your poems. I mean, if you go away, I'll never hear one of your poems. Will you read me a poem? I said, sit down! WOMAN: Wait! I know. I'll get 'em. Sorry, folks! Have to get off the bus a minute! Yes, ma'am. Here. Thank you. There you go. And a radio too. Yes, ma'am. I got them. But sure to take it easy. Yes, I'm trying. Please excuse. Yes, ma'am. I think I got most-- I think I got most of them. She-- she had a few. Do you have any more of the pieces? Well, there are only 16 in each set. No, thank you. Here's two more. Here, put these in. I'm sorry. I really am. Oh, goodness. Thank you. OK, folks. Let's load it up to go. You going with us, mister? No thanks. I had my $5 worth. [music playing]
