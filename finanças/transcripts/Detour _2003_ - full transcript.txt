[ SIGHS ] [ CHUCKLES ] [ British accent ] TODAY, IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE ANCIENT TOMB OF JEEP CHEROKEE WAS UNCOVERED ALONG WITH THE MUMMIFIED REMAINS OF ONE JACKSON ALDER. ALDER, A CAUCASIAN MALE, WAS BELIEVED TO BE IN HIS EARLY 30s AT THE TIME OF HIS UNSCHEDULED MUMMIFICATION. HISTORICAL FACEBOOK RECORDS INDICATE THAT ALDER WAS A MEMBER OF THE GROUPS "IF ONE MILLION PEOPLE JOIN THIS GROUP, NOTHING WILL HAPPEN" AND "I STILL PLAY THAT GAME WHERE THE GROUND IS LAVA." SCIENTISTS ARE RUNNING TESTS ON HIS REMAINS TO DETERMINE WHAT ALDER'S DIET CONSISTED OF, HOW OFTEN HE ENGAGED IN THE SEX ACT, AND WHETHER OR NOT HE CAN BE REANIMATED.

IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE WAY THAT I FEEL ABOUT YOU, AND IT COULDN'T CHANGE HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU. AND I'M SORRY. I'M REALLY SORRY THAT I CAN'T BE THERE FOR YOU IN YOUR LIFE. YOU GOT TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD... THAT I WOULD HAVE WANTED MORE THAN THE CHANCE TO HOLD YOUR LITTLE HAND, AND TAKE YOU TO SOCCER PRACTICE OR BALLET PRACTICE OR WHATEVER. WHATEVER YOU DO, I WANTED THAT. YOU KNOW, IF YOU SEE ME UPSET, I-I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M SAD. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, AND YOU WILL ONE DAY THAT... IT'S 'CAUSE I LOVE YOU. THE WAY THAT I FEEL AND THE TEARS THAT I'M CRYING RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE TEARS OF LOVE. [ CREAKING ] I'M GONNA END THIS NOW, BUT I JUST WANTED TO GET A CHANCE TO MEET YOU...
