Even if no one goes with me ... It's right here, just enter the alley. So baby, how long will you stay with your grandmother, because we have to go? It will only take a second. In fact, we need money. Yes I know. Hey, Richie ... I won't stay long. Ah, are you? I thought you liked the city already. Hello dear, come in. I'm cooking something now. Look, you're busy and I have to leave, so if you have money ... Oh, no, no ... no ... You won't get away so easily! Don't worry, because you'll get the money soon! OK but... you won't talk to me not to leave. No, I'm not going to do that. But I'm not going to let my niece go to California without sharing a bit of them my wisdom ... Sit. Good girls, be nice. Thanks Francis. I'm at the shop. Call me if you need anything. This is so stupid. I don't have time for that. Young lady, I have given you the best part of 20 years you can give me 20 minutes. Turkey inswess? I'm not hungry. Okay, what would it be like to prepare something for the road? Indifferent. Honey, I just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes. Just ... I know the last few months have not been easy. Don't you mean years? Could you really try to understand? Understand what? As for a certain reason you don't want to leave Three Rivers, and go somewhere better? That's not what this is about. When I was your age, I wanted to leave. Then you should support my decision. And if I had gone then, I would have just drunk, just as you are. I knew you would do that. Please, Lisa. You just know this guy. Don't go with someone you barely know, do not change your life for them! Maybe I love him, Grandma. How will your life be in California? Where will you live? We'll find a place to stay, okay? And Richie will have his band, and the formations need managers. Oh, I understand. Will you coordinate the band too? Yes. And don't try to tell me I'm wasting my life with music! I? I wouldn't say that. I love music. Dear... Believe me ... I know what you're going through. You have no idea what I'm going through. Believe it or not, Miss I was your age too. And it wasn't that long ago. It was 1951. And America was involved in the Korean war. Most girls my age were longing their lovers in uniforms. I had just finished college. And I lived on Sacamor Street, with my father, who was a doctor. My mother had passed away many years ago. And I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with my life. So I spent my days playing the piano. Have fun with my best friend, Francis. It was great! I do not know. I think Professor Hastings would say so. Well, Professor Hastings is a fool. Hi, Leroy resides. Elisabeth, I just received a phone call from Rev. Harmond, and wondered if you couldn't do her a favor. But I and Fran wanted to go to the movie. It will take a while. You will come here and give you the keys to the car. Daddy ... Elisabeth, I have to go. See you when he gets here. Bye. What? Nonsense ... I must do the favor to Reverend Harmond. Well, I have to go home anyway. Hi, Will. Hi Franie ... Hi, Will. Elisabeth ... Thanks for the serenade. I'm happy that you liked it. Are you still working on that old age? I have to work these days. I went to the cemetery to put flowers on my mother's grave, and imagine my surprise when I saw a large bouquet of yellow roses there. Her favorites. I was carrying something for my mother. I thought it wouldn't be bad to share. Yes? Well, thank you. See you again, Will. Elisabeth? It's good to have you again. Thanks. No, Will. So Will is very attractive, don't you think? Will, I've known him since I was little. He's sweet, but he's like a brother to me. I guarantee he doesn't think of you as a younger sister. Franie, you're terrible! That boy is in love with you. He's a very, very dear friend, but I didn't think of him that way. You need a boyfriend. I have to get out of this city. And where to go? Everywhere ... to see the world. On these trips, are you going to go it alone? Don't you want to have a strong man near you? Oh, that's just what I'm thinking. I just want you to be as happy as I am. You know how I am with Bobby. I'll be. I just think it's more in life than I am dating a boy, getting married, buying a house. Ok, I got it. I have to go. Good. I brought him into the world, and I wish I would leave too early, just because the drugs are too expensive. See you Friday. How important is it that I miss a meeting with Gregory Peck? Reverend Harmond is tired, and you would be very helpful if you went to the train station, and to greet the new pastor. His name is Benjamin Philips? It will reach 3 and 15. You just have to take it. Be nice, please. Good. Excuse me, Ben Philips? Not? Sorry. Benjamin Philips? Not. Ben Philips? Excuse me miss. Looking for someone, maybe I can help you. I doubt. What's his name? Benjamin Philips. Most tell me Ben. You mean you stayed there and followed me all the time? I have to confess. I'm sorry, your name? Elisabeth. Elisabeth Leroy. I like it, Miss Leroy. Also, Reverend Philips. Well, we should go. Looks like I'm your personal guide. I'll show you our little town. And I'll take you to church. Oh, I have to remind you, that is a reception table, tomorrow afternoon, after the church. Sounds exciting. You will make me stay here and listen to the story the day spent with a pastor? I have to go today, remember? Calm down. Richie will wait. Besides, Ben wasn't any pastor. What did you two do together, anyway? Nothing very exciting. I think it's boring now, you had to see what it was like in 1951. Three Rivers was smaller then then. We took Ben, and we toured our little town. In the end I showed him all the shops on the main street. That didn't last very long. And how does he stay with you? What is your occupation? I'll be honest with you, Reverend Philips. There is not much to do in Three Rivers. In fact, you're the most interesting thing here. No offense. No problem. In fact, I'm rather flattered. And here we are. I'm sure if you have more questions about our city, Reverend Hamond will answer you. I'm sure. Thanks. I'll see you at the table tomorrow? May be. But what about the church? Depends. Depends why? Who is your job. Elisabeth, I'm going to church. If I get any calls, take the messages. I'll be back for lunch. Wait father, come immediately. This is a miracle. Elisabeth Leroy goes to church without me asking. Daddy, don't be so dramatic. The great talent... Sit down, please. Good morning all. Before starting today, I am very excited to introduce you to our new pastor, Benjamin Philips. Thanks. Reverend Harmond. First of all, I would like to thank Miss Elisabeth Leroy, for the mesmerizing Three Rivers tour. I want you to know how happy I am to be here. From what I see, you have a wonderful city. And I look forward to the opportunity, to know each of you. Are you looking at them? And embarrassing. They didn't see men before. Oh, well they didn't see. Not like him. Too bad they waste their time. What do you want to say? Oh, please, you probably haven't noticed that I'm still looking at you. Oh, definitely not. Go talk to him. Frannie. Scared cat? Look at this. Excuse me. So, the first service. How did it go? Not so bad. I must admit that I am surprised to see you here today. Pleasant. I thought it couldn't hurt. No, he couldn't. I was interested in what you said today, about dedication to God's service. It's true? You woke up one day and that was it, have you given His life? Honestly, I got a call. But in time, I made the decision, to dedicate myself to the unconditional Lord. Unconditional? Oh, I wish I had your faith. Elisabeth. I hope you do not harass our new pastor. Daddy ... Reverend Philips, he is my father. I'm the father, Jim Leroy. Nice to meet you. Also. Ben, would you like to come to dinner tomorrow? Just steak, pies, nothing extraordinary, and a brilliant conversation. Well ... I really like steak. Good, at 7? 7. See you then. Oh, dad. You're interviewing Reverend Philips. Delicious. You just broke one of the 10 commandments. And which commandment do you refer to? At "don't lie". Hm ... Yes, it is important. Do not worry. I have other aspirations than cooking. What would it be like? Like leaving this silly city. Ah? Beautiful night. Why not go for a walk? That's a good idea, sir. Miss Leroy? Thanks. Why did you become a pastor? My grandfather was a pastor. And it reminds me that it is the hardest and most fulfilling job that a man can have. So ... Have you ever doubted yourself? Always. How do you prove that our lives make sense? Does the truth really exist? Well, we can't prove this, Miss Leroy, but, but we must keep to our faith. But how can you believe in something that may or may not be true? That is the very definition of faith. And my faith always referred to what God did, through me and with me. I have big plans for my life. I want to see the world. I want to go somewhere where music is, and where different cultures are. You seem very provocative, Miss Leroy. For you or God? For both of them, as far as I can tell. Hi, Will. Good evening, ELisabeth. You know the reverend. Of course it is. Reverend? Will. Nice evening. Surely. I should head home. Okay, thank you for a wonderful evening, and send my greetings to your father, and it was a delicious steak. Good evening. Miss Leroy ... So how do you get comfortable with living in Three Rivers? It's good to finish school, and I'm with my dad again. But let me guess, your restless heart seeks city life. You can say it again. You looked beautiful today. Thanks. Oh, it's late. I'd better go. Good night, Will. Good night. This is so outdated. May be. It seems to me that men were much kinder back then. Richie is a gentlemen. It is. Oh, I'm sure. You're not bored? Things started to take off a little. Ben suggested I use my studies to teach on Sunday school. Good. Who can tell me the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman? Someone? Saly? Jesus met a Samaritan woman and asked for water. So she gave him the cup, and he drank from it. That's all? The Samaritans were isolated, because they had different beliefs. Jesus band from the same cup with this woman was a powerful act of acceptance and friendship. Miss Leroy? My friend Janet is black and I've known her since I was four. But some of my friends from Junior High I say bad things about people of color. What do you do when this happens? Nothing. The Bible makes it clear that dividing or discriminating against people because of it religious or ethnic substrate, it was not the way of Jesus. I know but ... the thing is ... I'm ashamed to talk. Sometimes the simplest act of kindness, may be the most significant. When your friends reject Janet, stand by and support her. You don't have to say anything. You just have to do the right thing. You didn't have to bother with that! Hope you like it more sharp. I didn't use much sugar. Thanks. I warned you. Really. You can bring more sugar. No no... If you can, I must. I couldn't help but notice that you made a good impression among the women from us in the church. I hope you don't mind if I ask, but, how did you manage to stay alone? I'm going to ask you how you didn't get engaged to the man you were dating? But I'm not dating anyone. But I thought you and Bishop ... Will? Not. We are just friends. Do you care if they are available? Well... To Leroy, you made it clear that your future will not be here, and now mine is so ... I can imagine a situation in which I might change my mind. And what would that situation be? The person who is interested should approach me directly, instead of asking others about me. Well ... Miss Leroy, I would like to accompany me to a picnic on Sunday afternoon after church. And I would love to spend my afternoon trying to get to know you better. Is it straight enough? I think you can, Reverend Philips. Very well. A good day! Daddy, dinner is almost ready. Thank you dear. By the way, Reverend Harmond says you almost took him to school on Sunday. It seems so. Is my little girl growing up? Can I ask you something? Of course. When you met my mom, it was love at first sight? I don't think love happens so fast. For me it was infatuation at first sight. But true love requires time to develop. But when did you first realize that you are in love with my mother? Well ... we met for a few months, and I was about to go to medical school, and the more I thought about not seeing it, with that I realized how much I needed it. How did you not get married after he died? Your mom and I loved each other so much, that even after he left, I felt he was still with me. You think it happened because you didn't love anyone else as much as you loved her? I do not know. It might be true. But there are many kinds of love. First love can be very special. But if it doesn't work, I think it is possible to meet someone else. How old were you when your mother died? I was just a child. I didn't even know what cancer meant. I think it helped a little because I was the doctor's daughter. It still hurts. You know how it is. I'm glad I saw you. Be careful. You better make a move, Will. What is that supposed to mean? You know exactly what I mean. You have to tell Elisabeth how you feel. I think I'm afraid of what she'll say. You never know until you ask. And in your place I would do it as soon as possible. Why? Ben seems very interested. Hi, Will. You look beautiful tonight. Thanks. Bother? Not at all. Get in. Can I get you something to drink? No, thanks. Are you feeling alright? Yes. Only... I want to ask you something. Sure. Sit. This is ... I care about you. Very much. Since we were children, you were always ... Oh, Will I ... Will you marry me Elisabeth? I never... You are so special to me that I have no words to explain. But... You do not love me. I love you, I love you as a very, very good friend. But you can't marry me. It's Ben, right? I barely know him. But you fall in love with him. Loves you? I do not know. I didn't talk about such things. I hope he loves you. I hope you are very happy. Will ... You have no idea how much home support means for troops. Your church can be of great help. I agree with you. Will, what can I do for you? I'd like to talk if you have a minute. Sure sure. Thank you lieutenant. Thank you sir. Sir. Come in, take a seat. It won't take long. Ah. What is it about? It's about Elisabeth. I've always seen you take care of her. And I... And I wouldn't want to be hurt. I have no intention of hurting Elisabeth. I hope you realize what you have. Please don't stop. Reverend Philips, I didn't see you standing there. Please come in. If you're looking for my dad, he's not here. I'm here for you. Want my steak recipe? No, that's not what this is about. Maybe you want to listen to a recording I just bought. Sounds good. Miss Leroy, do you give me this dance? Yes, Reverend Philips. What took you so long? I have no idea. Daddy? I was so intrigued by the new love. How sweet it was ... I almost forgot it was a war going on. For months, destruction has taken place in Korea. The war wanted to destroy our property, and lives. The shot bodies, this burning cabin, they are tragic symbols of what creates war. Even people of good faith must fight. He must kill and destroy. They just lost their son in Korea. How can a mother handle such a loss? Ben ... Did something happen? We have to talk. Well, sure. About what? And what is it? Sit. Why are you so mysterious? Please. Long before I knew I was going to move to Three Rivers, I joined the army. I'm going to Korea. What the? They need military priests. Look. Elisabeth I never intended to leave you like that. But why do you do that? You're not a soldier. You don't have to go. I know I don't have to go. But I saw so many young people doing their duty and they never returned. I want to do my part. People need you here, Ben. I need you. Elisabeth, you must understand that I made a commitment to serve God. And if that means going to the other side of the planet, then it's set. Elisabeth ... you're the only one who made this decision difficult. I prayed a lot for this. Maybe God gave you the wrong answer. God does not give us the wrong answers. Sometimes it gives us answers that we do not want to hear. Obvious. Elisabeth, I love you. Really. And when I come back, we can get married. Oh, so now we're getting married. It's not as I imagined. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to have children and grow old together. And with the Lord's will, at the end of our life we ​​should be as in love as we are now. To Leroy, do you want to be my wife? Yes, Reverend Philips. Yes I want. It's great to see so much here today. The most important and most difficult spiritual test, it is the challenge of giving our lives to God. However, no decision can be more satisfying. Inevitably something will happen, that make us realize, that our power is not enough to overcome difficult times. Our personal power is limited, but the power of God is infinite. It just needs a simple prayer, Your will was not mine. Why are we afraid to turn our lives to a greater power? Why don't we seek the guidance of God, to see what guides us? Because that means I tell God that I accept whatever you choose for me. And I think you will give me the power to get along. It is an old hymn that says better than I can say. Even if no one goes with me, yet I will follow you. I'm not going back, I'm not going back. I just wanted Ben to stay with me. But that day I understood his devotion. What Ben was trying to tell me was that sometimes we had to put our faith first, he had already made the decision to follow God unconditionally, and finally ... I was ready. I decided to put my faith in everything God has prepared for me. My heart was breaking, I was in love for the first time, and I had to see that love getting on the train, and going to war. Remember when we first met here? How could I forget? When I return, I go straight to church, and I will make you my wife. I promise. You will be that far. I want you to keep that. I hope to help you. Go ahead sir. Thanks. I love you. I love you. Take care. God bless you. Hi. What is the problem? I know that girl. Is this Ben? When your mother died, how did you find the strength to continue? When your mother died, I couldn't imagine going any further. And then I realized, I can't afford to give up. People depended on me. You depended on me. Ben could die ... Hear me out! Don't waste your life thinking about what might happen. You hear me? My dear Ben, I hope this letter finds you safe, and it may sound silly, but count the days until you come back. I kept busy, I still like Sunday school, and we are ready to start the food program at the church. And last month's blood donation program was a great success. I saw so many young people dying, I talked about some graves and places, where friends and family will never be able to visit them. Soldiers face a fear that affects each of us in different ways. Some close, and don't let anyone enter, does not externalize his feelings. You see them mastering their tears because they are men. But when I see their best friends dying, you can not stop the tears. I tell them he doesn't have to try either. I ask God to guard you, he certainly hears this prayer from the heart. I know I promised to accept His Will, but it would be much easier to keep that promise if they would bring you home safely. Thanks to you I can't rush to leave Three Rivers. I just realized I needed to do something. Something relevant, something not just about me. So now my time is divided between the clinic and the church. I like to help my father, I think he likes to have me around more. Day after day, the people here are receiving love letters. The girlfriend at home can no longer bear the separation, or they realize that their home cannot be with them. This is devastating for a young soldier. I realize again how lucky I am to have you, I know without a doubt that when I get off the train you will be there. And when that day comes, I promise we will never be separated again. Daddy ... Your father was an extraordinary man, Elisabeth. Every person in this city will miss him. Thanks Will. He thought a lot about you. Do you come home later? Of course. Oh, Franie ... I'm glad you're here. I do not know what I would do without you. I wish Ben were here. Know. I wish I didn't have to go that fast. You don't realize how much it means to have you around. Believe me, I wish I didn't have to go, but, Bobby must be in Germany for months. Germany, this is so far away! What a star? At least two years. But you're coming back for the wedding, right? Of course. I wouldn't miss being an honorary lady for nothing. Thanks. Are we starting to look through your father's things? Not. I'm not ready yet. I'll wait until Ben returns. I'm sure Will wouldn't be upset. Will has already done too much. I don't want to take advantage of it. Besides this... I have a lot to do. Oh, that's the taxi. He arrived earlier. I have to go. Call me as soon as Ben returns, and I'll come quickly as a flash. I can't wait to wear the bridesmaid dress. Bye. Bye. Bye. Write to me. Okay, we're leaving. You know what an extraordinary man he is what an extraordinary doctor your father was. I know this better than anyone. I don't think there is any person in this city that he hasn't been treated for. Whether they paid it or not. What are you trying to tell me? I'm sorry I have to tell you this, but there is no money. Nothing? Not. Then I'll sell the house. I wouldn't, but ... The house is mine, right? She's mortgaged. I'm so sorry, my dear. I know there are many at once. I can negotiate with the bank if you want. Elisabeth ... Oh, Will ... I was thinking... If you worry that you have to move the house, do not worry. I'll take care of the yard, I will make the repairs that are needed. Thanks Will, but very soon someone else will live here. Somebody else? Not. The bank takes it. I understand. What will you do? I do not know. For the first time in my life, I will really be alone. No, it's not true. Here's how we do it. Pack your things and move to the free room in my house. I couldn't do that. I insist. There is enough space. And many nights I spend at the office when I work late. People will talk. Anyone who knows you will know it's a respectable arrangement. The opinion of others does not matter. I can not. I don't even have a job. I can work for myself. Business goes well, and I would need a secretary. I do not know. Come on, it's going to be fun. You always wanted to learn about the fascinating world of auto insurance, right? Good. But only until Ben returns. Of course. This is my office, here is the kitchen, you can make coffee in the morning. This is for dictation, and everything we send to the post goes there. And in the back we keep the files. Back files. Elisabeth? No why? I know you have a lot on your head, so ... Not. Good. Make yourself at home. I wanted so much to feel protected, to appreciate everything Will did for me. The loss of my father, the house ... it was so much of a sudden. I tried to handle it. What made it bearable was that Ben would be back soon. I'm so sorry about your dad, Elisabeth. I know how much it hurts. And I'd give anything to be there for you. I hope this is the last time you have to suffer alone. In times when these are easy to question the Lord's plan, but you must keep your faith. This will keep you going when everything seems too hard to bear. Merry Christmas, neighbors! Elisabeth. Leave him, I'll take care of him. I do not like it. I used to help my dad every year. I think we need more lighting. I have enough here. How about this? These are perfect. I have to go to the table to meet a client. Do you want me to bring you something? I think I'll fix something else here. Thanks. Are you Miss Leroy? Elisabeth Leroy? Yes. I'm Lieutenant Frank Mayers. I'm afraid I have to bring you bad news. About Lieutenant Ben Philips. Elisabeth. Elisabeth, are you okay? Elisabeth? It's true? I'm afraid it is. The lieutenant gave me the details, but ... you don't need to hear them. Yes. Ben was ... in a hospital near the front. There were exchanges of fire in the hospital, and was struck in the head. I'm sorry, Elisabeth, but ... no one survived. Mother, father, and now Ben ... I think it's hard right now, I can't even imagine what you're going through, but I know that in time ... in time? While? In time did I learn how to live alone? Ben told me that the hardest thing in life is to accept the Lord's Will. I think he was right. You can't sleep either, right? I'm exhausted. I can't fall asleep. Do you want tea? No, I'm fine. Are you keen to talk? I don't think I'm too coherent now. It could help you, you know? I do not know. I feel that since I made a commitment to follow God, I have lost all those I love. Elisabeth ... You made a commitment to God ... you were not obliged. Ben didn't want his death to make you doubt. No, he wouldn't. We'll talk more in the morning. Get some sleep. No, Grandma. I'm busy. Honey, you gotta see this. I have super gear, programmed all the way to California. Super, Richie. So, are you ready to go? Look ... we go through certain things so ... it will take a while. Do you go through certain things? What is that supposed to mean? Richie, don't be rigid. Okay, okay, whatever. It's fine. I'll wait for you in the car. Oh, you got the money already? Richie ... Good good... Who was? Richie. Oh. I think you have to leave then. No, not yet. He has some things to do. So I have some time to kill. Good. So ... how did you think of Ben? I remember something my dad said. You don't have the luxury of giving up when people depend on you. So I got involved in helping others. Before I know it, time has passed and, a dear friend came to visit. Fran ... Elisabeth. I'm so sorry for Ben. Let go, you can cry. I think I cried enough. I'm so glad you came this far. I hope Bobby doesn't mind. How long can you stay? How much you need. The house looks really nice. What is the problem? I swear I didn't want to say anything yet, you have enough that you already have to deal with. What is the problem? I'm not going back to Bobby. Why? He cheated on me with another. Sit. It was so different from when he returned from the war. Distant, nervous, nothing I said was good, nothing excites him anymore. Franie, it's not your fault. My boyfriend, Elisabeth. I know he loved me. But then he stopped loving me and I don't know why. It will be well. Elisabeth, are you closed? I have to leave a little earlier. What are you doing by sneaking in before 5? I want to go to the flower shop. The flower shop ... Yeah ... for my date. Your date? With whom? Carrie Holingsworth. Carrie from the hedge? Even she. Have you met her for a long time? No, this is our first date. Why? No reason. I just didn't know she was your type. I do not know. And attractive, good, and I seem to like it, why not be my kind? I think I was wrong. Well then. Good night. Hope you have fun at the meeting. And I. What are you doing tonight? Not too many. I'll go see a movie with Franie. Have fun. Who do you think is nicer? Gregory Peck or Garry Cooper? Gregory Peck. I love the scene when Gregory takes her in his arms, and a kiss. Oh, and it's so romantic. I could follow them three more times. I'd like to meet Gregory Peck one day. Do you think he would be interested? Of course they would. Thanks. Oh, and Will. Can't it be more obvious? We have to leave. Go, go. I'll take care of that for you. Look. I almost forgot. How was the movie last night? Was awesome. How was the meeting? Was well. Okay, just fine? Know. It was our first meeting. Will you see it again? I think so. We'll see. What is the problem? Nothing, just ... I can't reach the expected total. Let me see. Ah, here's the problem. You forgot to include that. Yes I see. Good. Hi. Carrie, what a pleasant surprise. I was shopping and I thought I'd go in to see if you would like to have lunch together. Sounds great. Good. Elisabeth. I'll be back soon. Elisabeth ... Can I talk to you for a minute? I think it's time to find my own home. I thought you were feeling good here. I feel good here, you have done so much for me, I do not know what I would have done without you, but I think it's time to get home just for you. And now that you meet someone I don't think it's right. Am I dating anyone? You mean Carrie? Of course I mean her. Now that you are together ... Together? Elisabeth. Please. Carrie is a very sweet girl, she is charming and good. I understand, this is the business. And I know she will be a very good wife to someone else one day. But it's not like you ... Will ... William Bishop, do you take Elisabeth Leroy to be your wife? Yes. Elisabeth Leroy, do you take William Bishop as husband? Yes. By the power invested in me, now I declare you husband and wife. You can kiss the bride. Contrary to all assumptions, I got married and settled right here in Three Rivers. And you know what? I couldn't be happier. But you had no feelings for Ben? Of course I had. But Ben was gone. And I was in love with Will. But did you really love him? I still love him ... Oh, wait. I want to do it properly. Welcome home, Mrs. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Bishop. Still thinking of Ben? Of course it is. Can you tell me something I don't want Will to know? When Will asked me to marry him, I knew it was a good thing to do. But... but I hesitated. Just in case. And in that case I thought of Ben. And everything that could be. Life is fun, isn't it? Elisabeth. Honey, it's me. What is it, what's the problem? My dear Elisabeth, I don't even know how to start this letter. I understood that you were reported dead in a hospital attack. I was seriously injured and taken prisoner. And I spent the last year and a half in a prison camp. Is he coming back here? He probably doesn't know about us. I think it's best to tell her. Yes I think so. If you don't want to see it, you don't have to. That wouldn't be right. I'm more concerned about what's right for you. When you read that letter, what was your first thought? Relief. But the second? Was that a regret? Not. Because I don't want to spend the rest of the marriage knowing that you are out of debt. What marriage would it be? I would have your loyalty but not your heart. Every time you look into my eyes you see him. But I love you, Will. I love you too, Elisabeth. Taxi. Thank you very much. Keep the change. Thanks. Ben. I came as fast as I could. Elisabeth ... I can't believe it's you. I imagined what it would be like if you came. Every day since you left. But then they told me you were dead. Dear... This is both the happiest and the hardest moment of my life. I married Will. I am so sorry. Have a good life with him? Yes. I love him. I would have thought that hearing this would break my heart. But somehow it makes it easier to bear. I love you, and I will always love you. I don't want to leave and not hear from you anymore. I want to know what's going on with you, what happens and where you are. So ... are you going to write me Elisabeth? Does that make things easier or harder? I'll feel better. I made fried chicken. It may be a bit dry. I'm sure it's good. I thought Sunday after church we could go to the lake. I haven't done that in a while. Maybe we can stop at that ice cream shop. I'd like that. Say the blessing. Bless the Lord, these gifts that we will eat, for the joy and comfort you bring us. For all your blessings Lord, we are truly grateful. Despite all that happened, Will and I were so happy together. In fact, we were inseparable. Maybe because everything we had left in the world, we were each. And then, in 1963, we were blessed with a beautiful boy. Your father. And he was going to be our only child. Well, until you come. How was my father? Oh dear. He was such a brilliant boy. And it was the apple of Will's eye. I really enjoyed watching them play together. What about my mother? Your mother started dating your mother when she was 20 years old. And she was a free spirit. They met for a short time, when Nicolas came to us and told us she was pregnant. Did you upset them? I wasn't nervous, just I thought they were in a hurry. Good. Tell me I'm outdated. Then I was born. Yes. Then you were born, and you were instantly the center of our world. Oh, Nicolas loves you. And he was such a good dad. It was a part of him that I had never seen. How did it happen? Well ... they were coming home from Nicolas's Christmas party at work. It was slippery. I don't think they know what hit them. Here we are Mach. That's 5 bents. Thank you sir. Hey, keep the rest. Hey, thanks. Wow, I wasn't expecting you. You certainly look good. Thanks. There are some moments in life that are impossible to erase. I will stay with you forever. That night when Will opened the door and heard the news from the cop, it is such a moment. When I was holding you in my arms, They told us that your mother and father are dead. Excuse me. We want to take this opportunity to thank you for coming, and to reward you for your respect. You all knew our Nicolas, know, it is said that there is no greater loss, than the one where the father loses his son. We are very, very proud of my son. When your father died, I gave up in a way. Why? Why are you doing this? I know I'm not perfect. But I have spent the last forty years in Your service. And you expect me to be blind? And you take everyone I love near me. Why? Hello, just a minute. Elisabeth? There's somebody on the phone for you. Hello. Hi Elisabeth. Ben? Oh, Ben. It's good to hear your voice. I just wanted to say the same thing. I'm really sorry, Elisabeth. How do you resist? Resist. Yes Will? As you can expect. He ... is silent. That's her way, I suppose. I help people deal with losses all the time. And right now ... I can't find the right words to help you, Elisabeth. I wish I had them. I don't know how much I can stand. I feel my faith is constantly being tested. And... Elisabeth ... I made a promise years ago, let's go according to the Lord's plan and believe me or not, this is it. He was my son. He was my baby. I wish I had another minute with him. I'd like to say goodbye. I know you want. But Elisabeth, but there are many people who have really given up, and they need you. They need your power and your experience in losses. Oh, Ben. Only... hearing your voice, knowing that you care, you have no idea, what support I have. I'll always be here for you, Elisabeth. Talking to Ben that day inspired me. I wanted to do something good with my supposed strength. So I became a volunteer at the hospital. Maybe it will help me ease the pain of losing Nicolas. Be nice to the lady, Criss. Do you mind if I sit down? How did it happen? Do you really care? Yes, I care. Motorcycle accident. Doctors say I may not be able to walk at all. What do you say? I do not know. I don't want to believe that. What does your family think? My family ... it's a joke. It's just me and my girlfriend. What's her name? Claire. She says there would be no difference to her, but I do not know... What would a disabled person like me do? Let me ask you this. Do you love Claire? Sure you do. Then you have to believe that she loves you too. Let me ask you something. What would you think if you were in her place? I would know that the one inside you didn't change. And the man I fell in love with is still there. Do you believe in God? I made a commitment to follow God, unconditional. And then something happened in my life, and made me doubt my faith. But now? Now I just have to trust that he has a plan with me, whether I understand it or not. Do you think he has a plan for me too? I know he has. Will? Yes. You wrote the wrong date on the check. Wrong year. They sent him back. Are you sure? Look at this. It's been since 1982. I think so. You know it's 1994 right? Of course it is. What do you suggest? Nothing. Good. I'm going to bed. I have to wake up early in the morning, to go to the office. It's Saturday tomorrow. I know this, I need to get some work back. Good night, pumpkin. Where's my good night kiss? Yes. And Elisabeth. Did Will leave the office? When? Good. No, everything is fine, just he probably stopped doing something. Good. Thanks. Honey, let's go for a little walk. Let's put on your sweater. This is my face. Will, what are you doing? I didn't remember the way. It's fine. And all right, come on. We have the results of your analysis, Mr. Bishop. I'm very sorry I have to tell you this. You have a degenerative brain disease. It could be Alzeimer, but we don't know for sure. If we're not sure, maybe the tests are wrong. Even if it's Alzeimer or something else, I'm afraid there is no doubt about the diagnosis. I wish I could exist. I don't want you to worry about anything. I'm here. Good? I know there are some things I need to do. I will update my will and give you your rights. And we should tell Nicolas as soon as possible. You know Nicolas is gone, isn't he? Isn't it? Oh Will, stay with me, as much as you can. I'll try. I will try with all my heart. My darling Elisabeth, Please don't be sad, when I won't recognize you anymore. To know that I love you, my heart will always recognize you, even if you don't mind. What are you doing? I love this time of day. It's so quiet and silent. Most people are not awake yet, I feel like you have the world just for you. I hope I can appreciate this longer. Will ... I thought, Elisabeth, I'll sell the firm to Abe, Abe Sigeal, and has wanted it for a while, and he'll give you enough money so you don't worry. I'm not worried about money. It's something I want to say as long as I'm able to talk. This will be the end of my life, not yours. I want you to go further and find happiness. And to know, like every time you smile, I'm happy. That was the beginning of the end for your grandfather. Over the next 8 years, he just it slid near me. Finally, I had to take him to the hospital. It's funny. I spent 50 years with him. And what I wouldn't give for another hour ... Is it too late? Not. But it is not long. Will ... I'm here now. I'm here. Thanks, because you chose me. He recognized me. Hello. Elisabeth? I'm Ben. I know what's going on there, and I'm sorry I woke you up I just received your letter. I'd like to be there for you. I really want. Know. I know Ben. Will was a good man. And I can praise him, and I must say that you fully deserved. You are very good. I... I'd give anything to tell you this in person. The church sponsors a group that must go to Africa. I understand. Just ... I appreciate that you called. I'll call you as soon as I can. You're always in my prayers, Elisabeth. Goodbye Ben. God bless you. I'm sorry grandma, I have to go. Richie will wonder what happened to me. Okay dear. I understand. I put some cakes in a bag for you. Good. Lisa, I hope you understand that I have shared all this with you, for... Grandma, you worry too much. It's my job. I'm not going to stop worrying. I just have to see what's there. Know? Know. Look, look. Grandma, I promise I'll get them back ... Please don't make me feel stupid. Only you have them. Well... thanks. Lisa. Bread, Grandma. God forbid. Hurry Elisabeth. We are late. Good. The later the better. These things don't start on time anyway. Keep them locked up. Oh, for God's sake. It's ridiculous. Now you can open them. Surprise! What you did? Nothing you don't deserve, Elisabeth. Thanks for 50 years of service. It has to be shocking to you. Shocking? Francis, in your life you kept no secret. I kept that. It was all about planning a little dinner, and then it snowed. Everyone from here wanted to participate. Because they all wanted to thank you for what you did for them, Elisabeth. What have I done? Oh. Just relax, and have fun tonight. Hello everyone. Tonight we are here to celebrate it Elizabeth Bishop, for her 50 years of service in our church, here in Three Rivers. We have some guests who want to come and say something. I doubt Mrs. Bishop if you recognize who I am. I'm Criss. I had a motorcycle accident, 20 years ago. That was a very low point in my life. I wanted to quit. But you put me on the right path. You should not have, you didn't even know me. Thanks to you, I have a wonderful family and, I'm still here, and My Claire, she's still here. Thank you. I was a civil rights lawyer, almost 40 years. And it all started in Sunday school. Oh, you taught me the importance, to support what I believe. I can't tell you how valuable this has been to me all these years. We love you Elisabeth. I had no idea I made a difference. You should be happy! I had so much influence on these people, and I couldn't stop my own granddaughter from destroying her life. You confuse people. You know you can't stop someone from living their life. Hi Grandma. What are you doing here? I am glad to see you too. I heard, what other people were saying about you. Honey, this was a long time ago. I do not believe. Where is it? Richie ... Richie. He went to Chicago. That was a little much for me. I think it wasn't love in the end. Grandma, I thought, I think I don't need to go to California. Yet... I have something to live for here, first. Oh dear. Oh, God. Beautiful. Right? Help me. Very nice. Thanks to everyone for that. Thanks France. I must tell you that when I arrived, I didn't really want to celebrate. I was thinking about my life. I was thinking of the past, thinking if it was worth it. If my faith in the Lord's plan meant anything. And then, you made me feel so good. Thank you. For the beautiful words, and so grateful that we can touch each other's lives. And I have... I think what I mean is that I want to celebrate. You know, when I was a girl, in this church, someone very special said, some words to me, that have been a guide in my life. Even if no one would go with me, However I will follow you, I'm not going back, I'm not going back. Anyway, thank you for this wonderful ... Ben ... You came this way. I told you once that I will love you so much at the end of our lives, how much i loved you in the beginning. And I love you. Ben. We lost our chance to be happy long ago. Mrs. Leroy, you are as beautiful as when I first saw you. Oh... Do you give me this dance, Mrs. Leroy? Yes, Reverend Philips.
