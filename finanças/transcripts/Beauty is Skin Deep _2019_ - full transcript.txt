- Hey, honey. You sleep okay, you look tired. - Yeah, I was just up late. - Okay, well, I wanna make sure you're getting enough rest. You're always taking on way too much. I'm fine, you're such a Mom. - Funny. Hey, how's that festival planning going? - It's going good, there's just a lot to do. - Yeah, okay, well, if you need anything, you just let me know, all right? Okay. - Mind getting some takeout tonight? I have to work late again. - Yeah, no, no problem, thanks. - Okay. I just hate the fact that I have to work late every night, leaving you here by yourself. - Don't even stress over that. - Yeah, okay, I'll try not to. Oh, I really hope this leads to a promotion, you know? - Well, if they ask me, you most definitely deserve it. - Oh, thanks, sweetie. - All right, I'll see you later. Love you. - I love you. Get it. Up higher. - Higher. - Higher, higher. Ah, Lily! - Oh, guys! Do you guys have anything going on after school? I was hoping we could finish up the festival planning. - I'm down. - Yeah? - Me, too. - Okay. - Yeah, I'm good. I just have to talk to Mr. Anderson about my civil rights paper. I'm pretty sure he's got to check 'cause my grades are... - Well, if it isn't the infamous liar. I am so sick of you talking shit about me. You need to keep that big mouth shut. - What are you talking about? - God, Ryan, why are you such a douche? Why don't you and your vultures fly out of here? - Tell them, Syd. - Tell them what? - What a psycho you are. How you stalk my phone, your random drive-bys at my house, oh, and your paranoia. Why don't you just leave Sydney alone and go find some other victim. - Really, witch? - You're delusional! - You feeling tough, Syd, with all of your friends around? - I just want you to leave me alone! - Come on, guys. - What's your problem, man? Get off bullying girls? - I suggest you back off. - You should walk away, bro. - I ain't your bro. - I don't think you know your place here yet, do you? This is my amusement park! - My place, are you kidding me? - Does it look like I'm kidding? - It looks like you have 'roid rage. - All right, break it up, break it up, break it up. All right, all of you, go back to class. Come on, let's go. - You guys wanna help me put this back up? - Oops. - You okay, Syd? - Yeah, I'm good. I just wish he would leave me alone. - If he keeps it up, you have to tell someone. - He's like evil incarnate. - Who was that new guy? He swooped in like one of the Avengers. - Yeah, that's Zane, he just moved here from Indiana. - He's totally hot. - Yeah, and he's kind of a bad ass, too. - Let's go. I'll see you guys later. - Hey, how about I work on the graphics, and then you can finish up the final bullet points on the last slide? - Sure. - Okay. - Want to grab some dinner first? - I appreciate the offer, I really do, I just don't think that's a good idea. - What's wrong with two colleagues grabbing dinner? I don't get it. - Nothing, I just don't want there to be any blurred lines within our relationship, okay? I wanna keep this strictly professional. - Hello. How's it going in here? - We'll have the final draft to you by Monday morning. - Okay, I expect you two to bring your A game on this one. - Okay, we're just making some final updates and then we'll be able to do a mock run-through with the rest of the team. - This will be a major account for us. I expect to be blown away. - Since you won't go to dinner, how about a walk to clear our heads? - I'm good, David. I'm good. - I'm going to wear you down. I don't give up easily. - Yeah, well, that's obvious. - Don't walk away mad. - Stalk much, Ian? - You okay? I saw Ryan's minions this morning. Listen, I was going to stand up for you... - Yeah, I'm fine. - Wanna meet up later and study? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - What was all that shit with Sydney? You make no sense. - Can we just talk about this later? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - I wanted to punch Ryan in the face this morning. - Don't do anything. I mean, if he finds out about us, he'll go crazy, and I've had enough crazy for a lifetime. - This is such bullshit! I'm tired of hiding. He thinks he owns this school and everyone in it. - We'll figure something out. I have to go to class. I'll see you later, okay? - Guys, what should we do for Spring Festival? - Mini golf. - Oh! I was thinking bowling alley. - Oh, I like that idea. How about rollerskating? - Oh! - Yes, yes. - I would love to see Ryan bust his ass. - I thought you were the nice one of the group. - Right? - I'll see you guys later. - Bye, Lily. - Hi. - Hi. - I wanted to officially introduce myself. I am Zane. Apparently, the idiot that started shit with the biggest asshole in school. - I don't think you're an idiot. I thought that was really brave of you to stick up for us. So what's your story, Zane? - Not much of a story. I just moved here from Indiana. That must've been hard, moving the last semester of your senior year. - Not really, I was ready for a change. What's there to do around this place? - Well, that depends, what do you like to do? I'm up for pretty much anything. - There's great hiking around here. I can tell you some good places to go. - How about you show me? I could do that. - So I'll see you soon? I guess so. - All right. - Bye, see you. - See you. - Hey, guys. Thanks for coming. So I'm here on a Friday, slinging burgers and coffee, so that's how things are going. - Well, at least you don't have to babysit your little sister. I'm gonna need a double shot of espresso just to keep up with the little tyrant. - She's so cute, though. - Why don't you babysit her then? - No way, she has to stay here and give us the 411 on the superhero. - Yeah, okay, I think I know what it was that he wanted. - He was just asking what there was to do around here. - More like if he can do you. - Gross! Did he ask you out? - We're going hiking tomorrow. - Nice, let me know how it goes. I gotta bounce, peace out. - Bye. - Bye, thank you. - Icy coke? - That's terrible. - We have to eat and you have to serve us. - I'll see if I can get you a discount. - So, are you nervous about tomorrow? A little, he's really cute. - Well, he definitely likes you. - I don't know about that. - There's no doubt. I mean, you're totally beautiful, smart, and nice. You're definitely a triple threat. - Then why have I gone to the last two dances with you and Olivia? - Because we're awesome. Yeah, you are. Best dates a girl could ever have. - Exactly. Honestly, though, I think most guys know that they're not good enough for you. - Yeah, whatever. - So, you nervous about tomorrow? - We've already been down that road. - Yeah, well, I would be. I mean, hiking's fun and all, but do you really wanna get all gross and sweaty on your first date? - Thanks a lot, Liv, now I'm gonna be self-conscious about my sweating the whole time. - Hey, we don't sweat, we glisten. - Yeah, okay, maybe you do. - Maybe you should stop socializing and try breaking a sweat waiting on your customers. - Such a dick. Bye, guys. - Have the mansion all to myself tonight. You wanna come hang out? - Yes, please, I don't wanna go home and start obsessing over tomorrow. All right, you got this, Liv? ♪ Y'all ready for this ♪ - Hey, little Miss Overachiever. You know, that new guy's not gonna stick around long once he realizes how boring you are. - You know what, Chloe? Take off that uniform and you're just a ditzy bobble-head jumping around a field begging for attention. And the only thing that's boring is what's going on inside that pea-sized brain of yours. - Yeah, so walk, bull skanks. Watch yourself. - Oh my God, you totally roasted their asses! - What is wrong with those girls? - Are you ready? - Yes. - I trust you told Sydney that no one is allowed over tonight. - Yes, she knows. And that she's to watch Sarah and not have her head buried in her phone all night. Mm hmm. Sydney, be sure to get your sister to bed at a decent hour, and only one bowl of ice cream. Be good, and listen to your sister. Sarah! - Okay. - We won't be too late. Calm me if you need anything. - Go, have fun. I love you both. He's here, wanna play hide and seek? - Yeah, but this time count to 50! - Okay. One, two, three, four, five. - What are you doing? There's like no one around for miles. - I'm just making sure. - Relax. We're not doing anything wrong. - Dude, it would be a bloodbath if anybody found out about us, and, plus, I don't want anything getting in the way of my scholarship. - You really think they will take your football scholarship away if they find out you're gay? It's not the '50s. - I'm not taking any chances. This is my future we're talking about. The worst of it would be my dad. He would literally kill me if he found out. - I don't know why I waste my time with you. - Because you think I'm hot. ♪ I 'll love you always ♪ ♪ I'll love you always ♪ ♪ And no chance every day ♪ Once we get out of here, things will change. I promise. ♪ I will love you always ♪ ♪ Real love is never perfect ♪ - Yo, dude. Yo, what the fuck are you doing? - Dillon, what are you doing? - Ian here was watching you through the window. Go ahead, tell her, Ian. - I was not stalking her! I was getting ready to knock. - Dillon, let him go. - Don't you ever come over here again, you understand me? Do you hear me, Ian? - Well, what are you doing here, Dillon? - I called him, Ian. I thought I heard something, and he was just seeing if I was all right. - If I ever hear you come over here again, and I mean ever, let's just say you'll be sorry. - What the hell, Dillon? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - I want you to leave, Dillon. - What? Why? - I can't believe you just shoved him. I'm not going through this shit with you. - Sydney, you know I would never lay a hand on you. - I'm serious, Dillon, leave. What are you doing, Ian? - I wasn't stalking you. - Well, why are you peeping in my windows? - I just wanted to see if you were awake. - You can't just show up to my house and do that. - I won't do it again. - Good night, Ian. - Do you wanna watch a movie? - No. My parents will be home soon, and I'm tired. - So another time then? - Good night, Ian. - Hi. - Hey. - How are you? I'm good, what's up? Not much, you ready? - I'm ready. - Let's do this. I hope you wore comfortable shoes. You're not in Indiana anymore. Here, it's hot, and full of mosquitoes. And it's hot! I think I'll be good to go. What brought you to Florida? A fresh start, I guess you could say. Oh, I get that. Me and my mom moved here about eight years ago, for pretty much the same reason. - What about your dad? - He died, a while ago. - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's okay, he was a horrible dude. What's there to do in Indiana? - Watch corn grow? - Cute. - I ran track for a few years. - Oh, you any good? - I can hold my own. What about you, what are you into? - Well, I'm your student council president. I'm in an honor society. Future Leaders of America. A few service clubs. - Wow, you're super involved. - I like to keep busy. It keeps the crazy away. - Doesn't seem like much time for a social life. - Well, I'm here, aren't I? - Yes, yes, you are. - So did you leave anyone special behind in Indiana? - There was one special lady. - Oh, I'm sure that was hard. - Yeah, it was. My grandmother is the sweetest lady you'll ever meet. What about you, anyone special? - No, just my mom. She's like my whole world. Oh my God! Thought you'd been hiking before. - I have, okay, just some vines. - Here, here, hold on. - Gee, I didn't expect you to be so handy with a knife. - I just cut some vines away, not a big deal. - All right, well, I'm glad you had it with you. Would've been real embarrassing to have the park ranger pull me out of here. - Just being prepared. You never know what you're gonna run into out here. Or anywhere, for that matter. - Vicious vines. - Exactly. I'll race ya! We should probably start heading back. It'll be getting dark soon. - Well, thanks for bringing me here. I haven't been hiking in years. - It's been a while for me, too. - We should do it again. - Definitely., it was nice getting some fresh air. - That's it? - The company wasn't so bad, either. Hey, Ryan. - Hey, what's up? - Do you have the notes from Wednesday's class? - Yeah, why? - Can I get them from you? - Gonna cost you. - Seriously? - Nah, I don't got them, though, they're home. - Okay, well, can we meet up later? - Yeah, I guess we can do that. - Cool. I'll catch up with you tonight. - Okay. - Okay. - Whoa, whoa, what is wrong with you, squirt? Do you even have a mirror in your house? I mean, look at you, you're a fucking beanpole. How are you ever gonna get a girl, looking like that? Or maybe you don't even like girls. You like guys. Yes, you do, like Johnny over here. Oh, yes. Oh, you two would make a great... - Come on, Ryan. - What, Ian? You wanna step in here and save the day? Yeah, maybe Sydney would like you then, right? - Maybe you should ask Dillon who she likes. - And why would I ask him? - Well, Dillon was at Sydney's house Friday night. - Nothing's going on, man. She heard a noise outside and she called me over to check it out. And why would she call you? - I don't know, maybe because we're friends. Besides, what does it matter, anyways? You guys aren't even together. - It's the fucking bro code, dude. What is wrong with you? - Go ahead, Ryan, hit me. - Hey, that's enough, that's enough! What the hell is wrong with you guys, hmm? You two, in my office, now. Go on. - Cheers. I honestly didn't think you would show. Why wouldn't I? - Just assumed you swallowed the Kool Aid form Sydney. - Listen, I know there's two sides to every story. Do you have the notes? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Thanks for the beer. - No problem. - Hey. - Come on in. - So, just wanna let you know, my mom may interrogate you. I've been telling her she should be an attorney instead of a nurse. - Interrogate's a pretty strong word. - You'll see. - You must be Lily. - Yes, ma'am. It's very nice to meet you. - Call me Katrina. - And this is my pain in the butt sister Alexis. - Aw, look who's talking. - We've heard a lot about you, Lily. - Oh, we sure have. - Well, everything's ready. We're pretty informal around here, Lily, so grab a plate and help yourself. Zane says you're very involved in school. - I keep pretty busy. Right now, we're getting ready for our annual Spring Festival. - That sounds fun. - It is! It also helps raise money for domestic abuse victims. - That's a great cause. Unfortunately, I run into a lot of that at the hospital. - You guys should definitely come. - Zane, you should take Alexis. - Um, no thanks. He's no fun. Remember when he cried when the Ferris wheel got to the top? - I was like six years old. - It was yesterday. Seriously? Maybe. - That is so cute. - Gross. - I'm done, you done? - Sure, I'm done. - Thank you for dinner, Mom. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - That's a lot of trophies. - I've been running track since middle school. - You should join our track team. I'm sure Coach Raeburn would love for you to try out. - Isn't it a little late in the season? - It's never too late. - So, any other questions about my illustrious track career? - Mom wanted me to see if you guys wanted any dessert, but looks like you're already having it. Alexis, get out of here! - I was getting ready to leave anyway. - Sorry, sorry, she has no boundaries. - It's fine. Actually, I really should get going. I have an exam tomorrow that I gotta study for. - All right, well, thanks for fitting me into your busy schedule. - Any time! Thank you again for dinner. - Oh, you're welcome, Lily. Come back any time. - See you tomorrow? - Yep. - Brooks. - Are you awake? - I'm up, I'm up. Well, there's been a murder. - What area? Glenwood Park? Yeah. How far are you? Now. Brooks, are you even listening to me? Hello? About 30 minutes. You sound like you've been drinking. - No, no, I haven't been drinking. Well, I mean, it's six am. Exactly, get your ass in gear. - All right. - Let's go. - Just for one second. - So what do we have, Kevin? - Uh, we got a male victim, 16 or 17 years old. What's the cause of death? - He was stabbed, a lot. - Time of death? - I won't know for sure until I get him back on the table, man. - Any witnesses? - One, Mrs. Johnson. She saw the body when she was out walking her dog. - Thanks, Kevin. - Yeah, let us know when you got something, man. - You got it. - Hey, are you a vampire? - I wish. - What happened? - Ryan was murdered. - Murdered? What? - Yeah, they say he was stabbed to death. I just can't believe it. - Yeah, that's weird. - 'Cause you're scaring her! - Yeah, I mean, I know the guy was a jerk, but he didn't need to die like this. - Do they have any idea who did it? Or why? - I don't think so. - Yeah, I mean there's no telling. So many people hated this guy. - I wonder if it was someone random or someone he knew. - I can't imagine someone we know could do something like this. - So sad. Oh my God, do they think Zane had something to do with it? - That would make no sense. - Lily. - What, what? - Are you okay? - I wonder what they want Zane. He had nothing to do with this. - Principal Bennett probably told the cops that they got into it on Friday. They're probably gonna question all of us. Michael! - Kevin, what have you got? - Well, our victim was stabbed multiple times, as you know. Talking six, in between the abdomen and the stomach. We've got liver lacerations, spleen lacerations, stomach was lacerated, bowel went all through his body, but what killed him was his aorta got lacerated along with his spinal cord, which means we got a long weapon. Now, the first two are hesitation wounds, meaning... - We got a first time killer. - Exactly. And he has no defensive wounds. Nothing on his elbows, nothing on his fingernails, nothing in his mouth. So I went and sent for a tox screen. - Got a time of death yet? 9:30 to 11:00. - All right. Do me a favor and put a rush on that tox screen. Okay. - I'm getting a lot of heat on this case right now. - Yeah, I hear you, man, I hear you. Hey, yo, how you holding up? - I'm alive. I'm doing better than somebody's doing. Miss Chapman said you had an altercation with Ryan Murphy last Friday. - Guess you could say that. Ryan was bullying a group of girls. - So you started a fight with him. - No, I asked him what his problem was, so he pushed me, and I pushed him back. - Can you tell us your whereabouts last night? - Are you serious? - One of your fellow classmates is dead, so, yes, we're very serious. - What motive would I have to kill a guy I don't even know? - Why don't you just answer the question? Where were you at last night? - I was at home with my mom and sister. Are we done here? We're gonna be following up on your story. I hope you're telling the truth, for your sake. - This doesn't seem to be a random murder. - No, this kid was a bully. He definitely pissed off somebody. I'm thinking Zane, maybe Sydney. - Hmm, if what Dillon said is true, he was both physically and verbally abusive to her. Think she could've done it? - What, she overpowered the Bull Sharks' number one running back? Come on, him and Jared both had scholarships. She would've had to have drugged him or at least had help. - Hmm. That Zane kid seemed a little off, and he wasn't the least bit nervous. - I just don't see a strong enough motive there. I do think we need to find out what happened back in Indiana, though. - Definitely. I think we need to put the heat on Dillon. - Let's do it. - All right. - I told you, Ryan and I were best friends. - Were you two lovers? - What? No. - You do realize that Ryan was gay? - Yeah, I think I would know. - Well, you don't know your friends very well. - This is bullshit! You're just trying to fire me up. - Hey, losing a loved one can be hard. - I'm so glad that you liked our vision. I'll be sure to have this sent over to you by the end of the day. - This is perfect. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you, Mr. Kumar. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Thank you, Mr. Dong. - You guys did a great job today. - Thank you. - You up for your next challenge? - Hell yeah. - We have a potential client that would like for us to come up with a branding campaign for Sponge-O-Matic. - Oh! - And I'd like both of you to work on it. - Oh, that's great. - Get me some ideas on my desk. - Did you hear that? We make a great team. - Yeah, I heard, David. - We should celebrate. - Yeah, I can't tonight. I haven't been home in a decent hour in weeks. But, more importantly, David, is what I've been trying to tell you for weeks, okay? I want to keep this relationship strictly professional, okay? - Bitch. - So, do you guys think you're gonna make it on Thursday night? - Which Wiccan thing is this? - It's the celebration of Astara. It's the coming of Spring, and it's my favorite. Plus, there will be food. - You had me at food. - I should be able to make it. - Awesome. It's nice to have friends there. Syd, do you think you're gonna make it? - Are you guys kidding me right now? You're acting like nothing tragic has happened. - Calm down, Syd, I mean, we're all upset, but we can't stop living our lives. - I've gotta pee. - She's been acting really weird lately. - I mean, she has a good reason to be. We all do. - Yeah, this isn't the normal high school drama we should be dealing with. - Yeah, but, I don't know, I just think there's something else going on. - Babe, you didn't have anything to do with this, did you? - Are you kidding me? You really think I'd kill my best friend just so I could date his ex? - No. I don't, I'm sorry. This is just so crazy. I mean, who could've done this? - I don't know, it's pretty messed up. - Maybe it was just random? - Yeah, could've been anyone. I mean, he has pissed off a lot of people. - Enough to stab him to death? I'm scared the police are gonna think I did it, especially if someone tells him about our history together. - Shh! Slow your roll. Listen, if you're innocent, you don't have anything to worry about. - What do you mean if I'm innocent? - You know what I mean. - It's been four months, and I feel like it was just yesterday. We were together for 15 years. I feel so alone. - What we have once enjoyed deeply, we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us. Helen Keller. - Very good. How are you holding up, Mike? - I'm fine, I just don't wanna be here. Hell, the only reason I'm here is 'cause Internal Affairs is making me be here. Just go on to the next person. As a matter of fact, the next time I come in here and you're going through your little circle, when you get to whoever's in this chair right here, stop there or jump to the next chair. You know you have to open up at some point. - It's okay to shut down and be angry, Michael. - Believe me, every heart has its secret sorrows, but the world knows not. And, often times, we call a man cold when he's only sad. You know that one, Mike? It's Longfellow. - Yeah, well, do you have any thoughts of your own or do you just go through life quoting other people? - You don't have to be such a dick. - Tabby, he's grieving. Mike, you can run all you want. Happiness is gonna catch up to you eventually. Fuck off. - That was nice, see you next week, buddy. Who wants to go next? - Read this. - What the hell? Who left this? - I don't know. - Syd, calm down. - What if they killed Ryan because of me? I can't believe this is happening. What do I do? - Maybe it's just a prank. - Well, if it's a prank, it's not very funny. - All right, take this to Principal Bennett. He'll know what to do. - Okay, I guess you're right. - Do you want me to go with you. - No, I'm good. - Hey, Sydney. - Hi, Ian. - Not today, Ian, I'm busy. - Well, are you around tomorrow? I don't know, Ian! See you later. - That was cold, Syd. - I'm just really freaked out. I found this note in my locker. - "I hope you feel safe now that Ryan's gone." - Who gave this to you? - I don't know, but it was in my locker. - Syd, sounds like it could be from the killer. - Yeah, but it sounds like he killed Ryan because of me. Sydney, you don't know that. - But why would it be in my locker? - Maybe it was Ian. - No, there's no way Ian could do something like that. - How do you know? I mean, the kid's clearly obsessed with you. - I don't know, I'll just ask him? - I don't think you should do that. I think you should give it to the detectives and let them handle it. - I mean, it's not like he's gonna admit he killed him, right? - I think you should talk to someone, Syd. Like who, my parents? It's not like they're any help. - I mean like a professional. I think it could really help you. - I don't know. I'll see you guys later. - Maybe it is Ian. - Could be. You never really know what's going on inside someone's head or what they're actually capable of doing. - All I know is that Sydney needs our support right now. - I can't even believe we're talking about this shit right now. - I know, right. It's our senior year of high school. We should be talking about boys, prom dresses, going off to college, not about a murder. - Girl, you need to get yourself an eating disorder. Oh, here we go. - What the hell is wrong with you? She needs to hear it. - Yeah, okay, well, at least she can lose weight. Your kind of ugly lasts forever. - Look who's talking, voodoo girl. Do I look Haitian? - Racist. - What? I swear to God, somebody needs to stab that bitch. - Yeah, someone needs to. - Let's go. - You okay? Okay. - Good afternoon, students and faculty, can I have your attention, please? I have some very tragic news to share today. There's been a recent tragedy that has hit way too close to home. One of our fellow students here at Glenwood High, Ryan Murphy, has been tragically taken away too quickly. This is a very sad and emotional time for all of us, and I want everyone to know that our number one priority is the safety for our students and faculty. We are going to have grief counselors on site for the next few weeks for anyone who feels the need to talk. The investigation surrounding Ryan's murder is still open... - The killer is right here in our classroom! - Dillon, that'll be enough! - Possibly help the police, please come to the office. We want everyone to know that all conversations will be private and confidential. Thank you for your attention. What up, socio? - Can't speak? Back off, heathens. - Hey, we're just trying to have a conversation with him. - Don't you think there's been enough bullying around here? - Walk away, bro. - Okay. - I ain't your bro. - All right, let's go. - My God. - Everybody to class. Go on. What's up, principal Bennett? - Go to class, Jared. Lily. - See you later? - Definitely. - This is beautiful, Olivia. - Yeah, you'd never know this is a feast for witches. - A witch feast, really? It's not like I've got a cauldron in the kitchen, brewing a potion or something. - It's literally right there. - So is Syd coming? - Probably not. She's been such a ghost lately. - I might know why. I think she's been hanging out with Dillon. I saw them the other day in the library, whispering, and then I saw them kiss. - You're kidding, right? - I know, I could not believe it, either. - I had no idea they were even together. Man, she kept this one on the down low. - God, she can't even function without a guy. - Why are you so upset? Are you still crushing on Dillon or something? - No, I just can't believe she's been seeing him and has kept it from us. - I probably shouldn't have said anything. - Look, I wouldn't worry about it, okay, Liv? I hate to speak ill of the dead, but he's just as bad as Ryan was. - I'm gonna use the bathroom, I'll be right back, guys. - I had no idea Olivia still liked Dillon. - Me, neither. - I hope she's okay. - She'll be fine. - Today, we are gathered for the service for Ryan Murphy. On behalf of the family, I would like to thank all of you for coming today. The Lord is near to all who call upon him. He will fulfill the desires of those who fear him. - You know, I bet the killer's here. - I know, how creepy is that? - Come on, guys, be respectful. - Why is the detective here? - Because they know that someone here probably killed Ryan. - Guys, please. - All the flesh will bless his holy name. - Sorry. - For ever and ever. - Yeah. - I'd like to end the sermon today with Psalm 23. "The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. "He makes me lie down in green pastures. "He leads me by quiet waters. "He refreshes my soul." - Queer. - "He guides me along the path for his name's sake. "Even though I walk through the darkest valley, "I will fear no evil, for you are with me. "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. "You prepare a table before me "in the presence of my enemies. "You anoint my head with oil. "My cup overflows. "Surely, your goodness and love will follow me "all the days of my life, and I will dwell "in the house of the Lord forever." Amen. - Are you okay? - Not really. - We didn't know that you were that close to Ryan. - We were pretty close. I loved him. - You loved him? - And he loved me, too. - I'm so sorry. We had no idea. - Well, that explains a lot. - Are you okay, Syd? - Do you think it's true? - I mean, it would make sense. That's why he was so angry all the time. I mean, holding in a secret like that must have been torture. - What the hell? It's the 21st century. Why did he think he had to lie? - He could've never told his dad. He would've killed him. This is just too much for my brain. I gotta go. Are you still coming to the Festival? - Yeah, I'll see you guys there. - Hey there, glad you made it. - This is awesome. You did such a good job. - You mean we. - We thank you. I have like 15 more minutes here. Do you wanna walk around for a bit? - Sure, meet you back here? - Oh, no, I'll meet you on the rink. - Okay. Hey, Ian. Hey, Ian. - Hey. - You here all by yourself? - Yeah. - Well, I'm waiting for Lily to get off work. You wanna hit some targets? - Okay, yeah. - Sick, cool. Come here. - I see you're quite the killer. - Yeah, I thought you'd prefer a knife to take down a shark. - Shut up, Dillon! - Really, Ian? - Man, why don't you go stalk someone else. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - I think we should be asking you the same question. - I'd back up if I were you. - What are you gonna do, kill me? - What the hell? What is going on? - How can you be so blind, Lily? You know he killed Ryan! - Why don't we let the police decide, you dipshit? - It could've easily been you, Dillon. I've seen you and Ryan get into it a few times. What happened, did he find out about you and Sydney? - I would never kill anybody. But I hear Zane here put some guy in the hospital. - Well, if you don't wanna end up like that, too, I'd take off. - I'm not scared of you. - That's not enough! Walk away, Dillon, all of you. - You okay, bud? Yeah, I'm fine. I'll catch you guys later. Those guys are assholes! - I'm sorry about that. I don't want you to get involved in all this. - I know you didn't kill Ryan. But, if you don't mind talking about it, what happened with that guy in Indiana? - He attacked my sister, and I lost it. I would never kill anyone, though. - I know you wouldn't. Okay, enough of all this serious stuff. Please, we just need to have fun. Let's go. Let's go. - Hey, you hungry? - Starving. Do you mind grabbing me corn dog? - Yeah, sure. - All right, I'm gonna go check on Sydney real quick. - Okay. Two corn dogs, please. - I think we need to teach that guy a lesson. I'm going out to my car. Catch up with you guys in a few. - Oh God! - You okay, you look like you just saw a ghost. - Yeah, I'm good. How's the corn dog? - Nothing like meat on a stick. - Are you ready to get outta here? - Don't you wanna eat your corn dog? - Oh, yeah, thanks. - You sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm good. I hate to bail out early, but it's been a really long day. - No worries. - Hey, have you guys seen Dillon? - Said he was going back to his car to grab something, but that was a while ago. - He's not answering any of my text messages. - Don't know what to tell you. - Haven't seen him. - He's probably looking up some skank or something. - You're such an asshole. - Such an asshole. - Dillon! Dillon, help, somebody help! - Holy shit, what happened? Is he alive? - Call 911! - We need an ambulance right away. We're at the Festival on off Parson Street. Please, hurry. - Oh my God. - What the fuck? - It's Dillon. - Here, don't touch him, don't touch him. Your prints will be on him. - Results will be on the board on Friday. It's Sunday, leave me alone. Brooks! - What do you got? - Same MO as last time. Multiple stab wounds, no defense wounds. Difference is this time our victim was stabbed from behind multiple times, meaning, anyone, anyone, no? Crime of opportunity. - Pretty risky trying something like this at such a public event. - Agreed. - Let me when you got something. - Will do! And? - Anyone? Put a rush on it. - So, look, we have two victims from the same school, same clique. What are we missing? - It's gotta be someone they both knew. We can certainly cross Ryan's parents off the list. - Yeah. - Tell you what, let's interview Aaron and Jared again, find out who had it in for him. And then really turn up the heat this time, make them sweat. - Okay. I'll see you first thing in the morning. It's already morning, Morales. - Look, I gotta get home. If I don't, Frank's going to divorce me. I've barely seen him these past few weeks. - All right. - Sorry, I'll see you. - Dillon was killed Saturday night. - Dillon? Are you kidding me, when? - Saturday night! Sydney found him in his car. She said he was stabbed to death just like Ryan. - What the hell? What is going on in this town? - I don't know, but this is getting scary. - That was fast. - Just don't say anything, and make sure you tell him you want a lawyer present. - Sounds like you've been watching a few CSI episodes. - I don't know how you can joke at a time like this. Morning, Zane. How's breakfast? - Pretty good, til you showed up. - Another student at your school was killed last night. But I'm sure you already knew that. Why don't we finish up your pancakes here So we can talk? - I'm good to go. - We know you were at the Festival last Saturday. - Yeah, along with half the town. - That's right. You mind if I search your backpack? - I don't have it with me, but you can go ahead. I wouldn't have a murder weapon with me. - We're looking for a lot more than that. As a matter of fact, we got a whole team of investigators at your house right now, and, if you're hiding anything, we're gonna find it. You know, Ryan's autopsy came back. Found a drug in his system, Rohypnol. Know what that is? - Isn't that the date rape drug? - More or less. - Well, Ryan's really not my type. - So are you gay or do you just think this is a fucking joke? Because, right now, you're a prime suspect in a murder case. Double homicide. - First, I'm not a killer, and, second, what motive would I have to kill Ryan or Dillon? I don't know either of them, and not gay. - Yeah, well, you knew them both enough to get in an altercation with them. - It's just stupid high school bullshit. - Well, this has escalated far beyond high school bullshit. Two victims, same school, prime suspect number one, Zane. - I know. But I'm not your guy. - Well, who's the girl you was with, eating breakfast? - Why do you wanna know? - 'Cause I'm checking everybody that knows the victim. - Well, she has nothing to do with this. - Well, that's for us to determine, isn't it? - Ah, anything else I can get for you, Detective? - No, just don't leave town. May I help you? - Yes, ma'am, we have a warrant to search your home. I don't understand, what is this for? - We had another homicide last night at the Spring Festival. It was another one of your son's classmates. - And you think Zane is involved? This is insane! There's no way he'd be involved in anything like this. - I'm sorry, just doing our jobs. - I didn't kill them. I don't care enough about them to kill them. - Ryan was a loser who liked ugly girls, but who might also have been gay. I mean, I think him and Ethan were a thing, right? - Y'all ain't getting me with this shit, man. I'm going to Ohio State for football. Peace, niggas. The only kind of bracelets I want are the kind made of gold and diamonds. - I don't kill with knives. I use magic. I mean, I don't use magic to kill people. I use it to cleanse them and heal them. Please, don't burn me at the stake. - Guys, my aunt's going out of town this weekend and she left me her house key. You thinking what I'm thinking? - Party! - I couldn't agree more. Honestly, I think we all could use a little distraction. - Yes. - True. - Where's Olivia? - She's working, whatever that means. Okay, themes, go. - 50 Shades of Gray, you and Zane. Are you gonna bring him? - Yeah, maybe. - You have been spending a lot of time with him lately. Are you scared he's a suspect in these murders? - I think we're all suspects. - Who have they not interrogated? - Okay, enough with the suspects and murders. Anyway, you do not wanna go to college a virgin. - Syd! - Oh my God! Enough with Lily's sex life. - Thank you. - I'll get the kegs and some goodies. You guys get the snacks. - Hell yeah. - Awesome. - Okay. - This is gonna be epic. Let's do it. - Ian, did you write these? - Yeah. - My God. Did you kill Ryan and Dillon? - No! You actually think I'm capable of doing something like that? - Then why would you put these in my locker? - Because you never talk to me anymore. You're always with some guy. - Ian, we're friends, and we always will be, but it's nothing more than that. I'm sorry. - Okay, okay, my party, my rules. Hand it over, Sunny. - It's Julie. - That's what I meant. Zane, Lily! - Hi. - Hi. You guys look so good. - You really do. - How about a game of beer pong? You guys against me and Jared. - I have to warn you guys, though. I'm the beer pong champion around here, right? - Mm hmm. - It's cool. - We'll see about that. You got one. - Take me away. - Hmm? - Take me away. - Take you where? - Somewhere. - Sure. Follow me. You don't have to do this. - I want to. Morning. - Hey. - Hey. - Oh, shit, we fell asleep. - Yeah. We gotta go, though. My mom's been lowing me up. - Okay. Last night was amazing. - Yeah, it was. We gotta go! - Okay. - I saw Zane dropped you off. - I really care about him, Mom. - Just take it slow, okay? I've got some good news. And some not so good news. - What's up? - I got the promotion. - Mom, that's amazing, congratulations. - Thank you, oh, Lily, I'm so excited. Is it more money? - Yeah, it's a lot more money. - Okay, so, what's the not so good news? - The position's in Fort Myers. - Fort Myers? Mom, I graduate in four weeks. - Yeah, I know, but, honey, they told me I could start after you graduated. - I wanted to have the summer here before college. - Yeah, I know that, too. Lily, I'm sorry about the timing. - I know that you worked really hard for this, and I'm not trying to seem selfish, but I'm just not ready to move away yet. - Yeah, I know. Hey, we'll figure something out, okay? - I need to go shower. ♪ They say ♪ ♪ Things that go up must go down ♪ ♪ But you got me off of the ground, love ♪ ♪ You've taken me higher than I've ever been ♪ ♪ And when you're talking to me ♪ ♪ I feel like we're the only ones ♪ ♪ Just you and me ♪ ♪ As the world spins on ♪ No, I'm not your daddy. Stop it! - So, did you have fun at Mia's party last night? - Yes, did you? - Probably not as much fun as you did. - And why do you say that? - We saw you sneak away with Zane. - So, how was it? - It was amazing, and a little bit awkward. - Yeah, first few times are usually like that. How many times have you done it? - Less times than you. - Touche. - We're moving. What do you mean you're moving? - My mom got a promotion, and it's all the way in Fort Myers. - When do you leave? - Right after graduation. - No, no, that can't be happening. This summer's our time, our time to revel in our freedom and being carefree just a little bit longer before life just grabs us viciously and strips us what's left of our innocence. - That was deep. Thank you. - I'm gonna miss you guys so much. - Gonna miss you, too. - I can ask my mom if you can stay with us. - I appreciate it, but I couldn't make my mom there by herself, especially since I'm going to college soon. - Okay, this is way too depressing. Let's stop talking about this. - Yeah, I agree with Syd. - I do have some good news, though. They found someone else's blood on Dillon. - Do they know whose it is? - I don't know, but the police asked me to come down for a cheek swab. - So they actually think that you're capable of killing Dillon and Ryan? - I guess so. I will just be glad when they can get a result back and take me off their hit list. Did you hear anything from Zane? - I wonder who else they're checking. - I don't know, I saw Zane while I was there. - Did they ever talk to you, Lily? - No, I assumed they would. - I'll just be glad when this is all over. - Yeah, me, too. Hopefully, everyone can get their closure, especially Ryan and Dillon's family. - Yeah, I can't even imagine what they're going through. - I'm going to miss working with you. - Well, we'll still be working together, David, just not in the same office. - Yes, but I won't get to see your pretty face every day. - What are you doing? - Just grabbing a stack of papers. - Yeah, well, you need to back off. - Why? - Because you're making me very uncomfortable. I swear to God, David, I'll call HR on you. - No one will believe you. - Yes, they will, because everyone knows what a pig you are. - Mom! - Back off! Let's go. - Mom, wait. - Lily, stop. - What was just going on? - Don't worry about it, just let's go. - Are you okay? What was going on in there? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Was he pushing himself onto you? Did he hurt you? - Let's just say he really crossed the line this time. - You have to tell someone. - Look, Lily, I just don't want this to be an issue, okay? I really need this promotion, and I don't wanna seem like trouble. - Guys like that deserve to be punished. He can't just get away with it because he'll do it again! - I know, I know. Look, don't worry about it, okay? I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it. - Yeah. We did it. It's such a strange feeling to think that some of us may never see each other again. Most of us have spent the last four years walking past each other in these hallways, recognizing familiar faces and the labels plastered on each of our foreheads. And I just want everyone to know that today is the day that we remove those labels and we toss them in the trash on our way out that door. We can be whoever we want to be. We all get a fresh start. This past year has been filled with many wins, challenges, and heartaches. The most challenging event was the loss of our two fellow classmates, Ryan Murphy and Dillon McDowell. The important thing that I've learned from this tragedy is how precious life is, and that it can be taken away from us in an instant. So I want everyone to know that you need to go out there and achieve the goals that are important to you. And, please, be kind to everyone. And, one last thing, congratulations to the best graduating class at Glenwood High, to the class of 2019. We did it! - All right! Woo! Brooks! - So what's this about? - Well, a stabbing. Janitor found him. Stabbed to death. That's it, anything else? - Yeah, 23 stab wounds and also falling on account his throat was slit. Seems like overkill. - Surveillance? No, no. - All right, so who had it out for the victim? I mean, he's pissed a few ladies off, that's for sure, but he seemed to get along with everyone. It just doesn't make any sense. - It sure is a pretty competitive industry, right? It is, but, I mean, David wasn't hated. I don't think. - I'm gonna need you to get me a list of everybody he worked with. - Of course. - I mean everybody. - Of course. - Hey, Brooks. Yeah, I'm at Glenwood High School. They've got another body. It's Chloe. - Hey. - Hey. I'll take that. - No, it's okay, I got it. - Oh, shit, sorry. - No, it's okay. It's okay. I got it, thanks. Sorry. - Of course. - All right. I will see you next weekend, right? - Couldn't keep me away. - Good.
