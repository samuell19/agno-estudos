We Indians... in the name of our Gods... hereby solemnly pledge, that henceforth... every deed of ours shall be for the Motherland... for the welfare of humanity, irrespective of caste and creed. Victory to India! He wants to know not the religion you follow But God will certainly want to know what deeds you have done You are our religion, our faith We mean everything to you And you mean everything to us August 15; India's Independence Day. Everything we shall do, for you, beloved nation Our hearts are for you We shall lay down our lives for you, too Our hearts, we have given you We shall give you our lives, too, beloved Motherland You are the one I do my deeds for; you are the one I have faith in You are my self-respect We shall sacrifice ourselves for you, O Nation Live and die, we shall... for you, O beloved nation Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians... We share this country; we are one What tries to separate them... is not religion; but the feelings of the devil Live we shall, for you; and die for you too, beloved nation These fires and devastation; these bullets of hatred... Hoodlums, they are; robbing dreamy-eyed brides They shed their own blood and call it a festival Live and die, we shall for you, beloved nation We have given our hearts to you; we shall lay down our lives, too For you, beloved nation There are two types of criminals. The ones who turn criminals due to poverty and circumstances. Dharma, for instance, belongs to that category. And there are those for whom crime is a profession. Dr. Dang, for instance, who belongs to the latter category. It's believed that you've appealed to the Government for Dharma's release. Yes, that's true. Six years ago, Dharma had come to the jail... to serve a life sentence for murder. Do you know why he had committed the murder? Because his younger brother was battling for his life... in the hospital, around the same time that this incident took place. My brother is lying unconscious in the hospital, Sir. I must rush these bottles of blood for his operation. Please let me go. My truck is parked far away. Go and park yourself far away, too. Go away! Don't be so stone-hearted. Should I not reach there in half an hour, my brother will die! Let me do my duty. You may come when your turn comes. Go away now. Sir, please come here. Are you in a hurry? - Yes. D'you have 300 Rupees on you? - No. I'd have 20 or 25 Rupees. 20 or 25 Rupees is not enough. Go and stand in the queue. Come on! Go away, I say! My brother will die! - How can I help it? Go away! Scoundrel! This blood was meant for my brother. This blood was meant to save my brother's life. You're a killer. I won't spare you! How would you describe a crime of this nature? I tried on my part, and instead of a life imprisonment... Dharma lived behind the bars for four years. Today, he's leading an honourable life in his village. What is your opinion about a criminal like Dr. Dang? On the strength of their power and wealth, these foreigners... want to cause disturbances and unrest in our country. These terrorists, who kill thousands of innocent children and people... should be termed as not just criminals, but as demons. It's the prime duty of every religion and every human being... to eliminate such demons. And we will surely give these demons a fitting reply. We've arrested Dr. Dang. The well-known international leader of terrorists, Dr. Michael Dang... who was also the chief of Operation Black Star has been arrested. Dr. Dang will be taken to a secret place under tight police security. Wonderful! This is going to be great fun. Where's Rana Vishwapratap Singh, your jailor? It's very nice meeting you. I've heard a lot about you. You've penned some wonderful novels. Your knowledge of crime and criminals is amazing. As I said, I'd heard of the Sitaram Central Jail, while in Germany. Wonderful! This is going to be fun. In the 50 years of my career, I've visited the whole world. I've been in nearly all the jails, but only for short periods. There must hardly be a jail where I've stayed for even one week. I must've spent 2 or 3 days at most, and was out in that much of time. The jailer of every such prison has always accorded respect to me. I was taken care of all the while. This fellow speaks as if he's not a prisoner, but a minister! Please arrange for some cushioned beds, a writing table, and... a telephone too. But please do not forget flowers. This chamber is too small. It's a matter of only a few days anyway. I'll send a list of all the things that I might need. The painting in this room is very ugly. Please arrange to have this room painted. Angry old man! This is going to be fun. It's very important to know in which jail Dr. Dang has been lodged. By arresting Dr. Dang... the Indians are posing a serious threat to our plans. We'll give a fitting reply to their challenge. We are ready for a showdown. You'll have to tell us the name of the Indian jail... where Dr. Dang, our boss, has been lodged! I will not reveal it. I just need to say 'Go' on this telephone... and your whole family in Delhi will be wiped out in one single blast. At least the nation will be saved. This DSP was in-charge of the security of Minister Tripathi. Tripathi played a crucial role in the arrest of Dr. Dang. Mr. Tripathi is here! Greetings, sister-in-law! - Greetings to you! Ever since you've become a Minister, you've forgotten that we exist. You're right. To carry out a Minister's responsibilities... one is compelled to neglect domestic responsibilities. What a life! I travel a lot between my home and New Delhi. My respects to you! - May you live long! Grandpa! The Minister has arrived! My dear daughter! You haven't given me a kiss since this morning. So I can't see or hear anything. I suppose you remember the engagement ceremony scheduled for Monday. I do. But I'm sorry to say that I won't be able to attend. But, I promise that I'll surely attend the marriage. Why even attend the marriage? What for?! You'd better come when Anil becomes a father... and his son grows up too. Or arrive when his son gets married. There! Here comes the jailor with a staff in his hand! If Uncle doesn't attend, I won't get engaged. Don't you commit this mistake ever! Had I depended on this chap, I'd never have got married. It would've been a lot better. Your wife would've blessed me. She would've been spared a life of bondage with you. Don't be carried away by his talks. He thrives on the gift of the gab. He was famous for his speeches in college... while I was famous for my action... my deeds. That's why you became an employee while I became a Minister. What do you mean? - You've lost the bet. Didn't I tell you, the Government would reject your application? It has been rejected. - Which application? Just because he has written a couple of books on criminals... he's now obsessed with this new idea. He sent the Government the scheme... under which he wants to release a few dangerous criminals... and wants to reform them with love. And by forming an army of such criminals... he intends to eliminate criminals and terrorists in the nation. If your Government hasn't paid heed to my request... it's the Government which is the loser, not me. But did the Government not award you with a gold medal for your book? That's an old habit of the Government. It confers a gold-medal even if it doesn't approve of something. But they did honour you! - They did, all right. At least you accept something! - You too will accept it. What'll I accept? - You'll attend Anil's engagement. And if you don't attend... - But please listen to me... To hell with everything! The Commissioner is on the phone. - I'll be back. Uncle! You're his only friend. If you don't attend, we'll all be hurt. I sent you a request for a sofa, a chair and a writing table. Your request has been turned down. - Why? Because this is a jail, not a hotel. Love for other criminals, and hatred for me, eh? What's the reason? They turned to crime due to circumstances. Whereas, you're among those who create such circumstances. I can't understand why the Government lets you live... and allows you to carry on spreading the poison? How big is your family? I mean how many children do you have? 900 million. I asked you about your children, not about India's population. You might look at it as population. But for me, they are my children. They are the children of the family of India. Don't you feel that you're too much of a patriot? Every true Indian ought to be a patriot. Each of your Indian can be bought over for two pennies each. You may even try to buy me over then. You're here. And I'm here, too. Try it out. Greetings, Uncle. - May you live long. Congrats! My brother and sister-in-law have arrived too. Telephone your father, and ask him to come home immediately. He's always busy with his official work. Father... - Yes, son? Uncle and aunty have already arrived. I'm coming. I'm busy with my work. Mother's terribly angry, father. - Pass over the telephone to her. Mother's not willing to talk to you. Just do as I say. Give her the phone. Just listen to me... The sound of your bangles tells me that you're angry. What did you say? Deliberately? ...Me?! Do you know that C.B.I. Officers from Delhi are here on a visit? I've to prepare a report, and submit it to them today. How much time will I take? At least an hour. He's arrived. Greetings. How about a bet? - Bet on what? An officer being bashed up. There she is! That Dang harassed me like crazy. The thing is... before everybody present... Go upstairs and get dressed quickly. A difficult question, this one. It comes up time and again At this age, my wife still asks me if I love her My asks me... do you love me? And what did you say? I've been saying it for years! I love you... Every day and every moment, I've said, I love you Day in and day out... even as I work, I love you When I get back home every evening, I say, I love you I sleep and eat, drink and walk... I love you My wife still asks, do you love me? I keep repeating... I love you I've sired three sons. And yet... I love you I'm an officer everybody respects. But... I love you I throw my weight around everywhere. And yet... I love you I'm scared, when I step into the house There's one song I sing for you, darling... just this song Everything I shall do, darling. Just for you I've given you my heart. I shall give you my life, too No other promise matters. Nothing else does There is nothing more precious than your love I shall live and die... just for you, darling I've given you my heart. I shall give you my life, too You come first Everyone else comes after you You have been my effort; you shall be my outcome Live for you, I do. Die for you, I will, darling I've given my heart to you. I'll lay down my heart for you, too Dr. Dang creates war! This is the first time ever that somebody has slapped Dr. Dang! Did you hear the echo of this slap? You also will hear the echo of this echo. You'll surely hear it. Till as long as you live, you'll continue to hear it. I'll never forget your slap. You should surely not forget it. I'm glad that you've realised the impact of an Indian slap. Just remember that it was only one hand at work. And then, you're quite an intelligent person yourself. Give him two of these tablets with some turmeric-laced milk. You'll recover completely by tomorrow. You've got to dance at Anil's marriage. You must dance and make merry. You were the source of joy at his engagement, and the wedding... What happened? - I'll go and check. The PSO has attacked the jail! Please stay in here! No. - Do as I say. Hurry up! Madam! Please don't go any further! Mother... Grandpa! Grandpa! Greetings. Take that away! She's got to carry my message to Rana Vishwanath Pratap Singh. Madam, please deliver my message to him. Tell him that this is me... and this is him... Mother! And these are the children of India, your Motherland. Mother! Mr Sharma! God Almighty... What happened? And how did it happen? It was the PSO... Now you will hear the echo of this echo, too. The echo! Rukmani... How did it happen? Where are our children? Father! C'mon! Anil is still breathing. Don't you lose courage, okay? We'll go to the hospital. Everything will be fine. The terrorists have killed them. The poor woman lost her elder son. The younger one is dead, too. Move back, will you?! What're you doing standing here? They've already gone inside. Go on! Where are you taking her? She has not been harmed. The wounded have already gone inside. - She has lost her speech. What? - She has lost her speech. Lost her speech? For you, beloved nation... Mother went there to administer medicines to a sick prisoner. I had accompanied her. What kind of people were they? Don't be afraid. Think again. Please try to remember. Calm down, please. Why do you ask her? What can she say? Her young sons have been killed. She had a full family. Mr. Tripathi? Where's Rana? - He's sitting over there. How could you resign your job? What do you want to prove? Do you want to prove to the world that... a person like Dr. Dang has crushed your courage? Not at all. - Then why have you resigned? I've resigned because... only I will now fight the battle with Dr. Dang. All alone? - Yes. No. We're all with you. I've been discussing this with the Ministry for four days. The Government has rejected your resignation. But they've accepted your proposal for an experiment. Here's your letter of approval from the government. You can now choose whichever three criminals you wish... and embark on whatever secret mission against PSO and Dr. Dang. You've chosen three criminals from a list of 72 prisoners. Do you know, all three of them have been sentenced to death? I know that. According to intelligence reports... all three are sentimental fools and terribly mean-minded, too. They're hardcore criminals; not worthy of being trusted. Can I meet these three criminals? - Sure. This is your first prisoner, Baiju Thakur. The High Court has sentenced him to be hanged... for having killed four people. He's presently lodged at the Nasik Jail. Let me explain this in short. I've no interest in you, not in your country... not in the friends or enemies of your country. I'm not even interested in myself. Have you come to grant me life? Not to grant you life, but to ask you for life. You mean there is death on both sides. If you die here, it'll be a shameful death. And if you die there, you'll be declared a martyr. Which means, death is certain, isn't it? No. If you survive and return, you'll be respected by the world. Now, that's something. This is a nice opportunity to make the slip. Sir... you've shown me the right path. Shall we go? After choosing a prisoner from the Nasik jail... Mr. Rana has gone to the Hyderabad Jail. The prisoner that he has gone to meet is a former terrorist. Before he was arrested, the PSO smashed his right hand. They broke my hand! The bastards made an invalid out of me! They made me use this hand to fire on kids of innocent people! I was a blind fool! I trusted them. And one day, they told me that I have to commit a murder. I have to murder Heena. I had to kill Heena, my sweetheart! She was a policeman's sister. I refused. So they killed Heena. They then cut off my hand! Rexson is a stooge of Dr. Dang... the scoundrel! I'd change my name if I don't feed his flesh to the vultures. But, Sir... you can go away. I don't vibe well with the government. It's futile. Go away. The trouble is that you follow your heart, not your mind. Today is the 16th of September. - I know. You'll be hanged to death on the 21st of September. You will depart from this world. On the same night, Rexson and Dr. Dang will celebrate your death. You will be buried with your ambitions in this very jail. What you say is right. I really follow my heart, and not my mind. I've always been close to those who follow the heart. Do you trust me? - They have betrayed your trust. I know for sure that you will not betray my trust. He can save you from the noose. Really? Can you save me from being hanged?! How? If you obey all that Mr. Rana wants you to. Mr Rana! In that case, you are my God! And I'm your devotee. My Master, my Lord, my Boss! Save me, please! I swear upon the dust on your shoes. Please save me. I'm speaking the truth. Ever since the judge passed the sentence... I've been imagining a dirty cloth hanging by the pole... and I've been hanged to death! My neck has been stretching like this, ever since! My Lord! Please save me! I'm very scared of death. This is my first time! And I'm not used to dying. What say? Please tell me. Shall I switch on the light? - First let go of my feet. Here goes! Please switch on the light, my Lord. You'd better understand one thing clearly. I'll have the right over the life that is being granted to you. You'll have the right. I'll consider myself dead. I'll live my life exactly as you want me to. I'll sit when you ask me to. And get up, when want. I swear! Why have our foreheads been marked with the sacred mark? Have you ever seen a goat being marked on its forehead... before it is slaughtered? You should understand. Take care of your sister. I'm taking one of your belongings with me. This... You won't be there. But your voice will be with me. Whatever you say, you've changed our appearance. Who's playing the banjo? Anil, my younger son. Wonderful! By the way, I play banjo very well, too. I know. That's why I've brought one for you. Fantastic! May you live long. Hear that? Dada Thakur has brought a banjo for me. Want me to play something on this? Dada! You said we've got to travel thousands of miles. Do we have hear such boring devotional songs all the way? Why don't you play a film song? This is not a devotional song. It's a song written by my wife. We used to sing this song together at prison jail. I consider myself fortunate that you've visited me. But I cannot control my tears upon hearing the ghastly news. You'll have to control your tears. The tears will remain our secret till we have achieved our goal. This secret I shall keep in my heart, Mr. Rana. Don't call me Rana. Call me Dada Thakur. That's right. Dada Thakur. This is the Indian border. Before Dr. Dang's arrest... the PSO and their trucks often frequented the place. But not anymore. This is the place from where several infiltrators have entered our nation. The PSO is said to have organised a very huge camp across the border. We're thrilled at your arrival. I suppose you've understood the game plan? Greetings. - Greetings. This is Mr. Laxminarayan. Mr. Laxminarayan is a very good friend. He's a leading official in the Indian Government. He wants to join our gang. We've deposited 50,000 dollars in his account. I suppose you've told him the rules of joining us, Kittam Kittu? Yes, I've explained it to him. Before joining the PSO, we take a holy pledge. The pledge has to be taken there. And here's the coconut. Where's the coconut? Here's the coconut. Go and break it there. It'll mean that... you've taken the pledge, and you've joined our group. Go on. I see... God is Great! You're a fool, Rexson. - What do you mean? He didn't come to meet me, but to ruin us. He was from the CID in India. Indian revolutionaries had killed my father in 1947. It was on that day, that I'd sworn to ruin India one day. I'll break India into pieces within a year. God is Great! I want a powerful man like you to sit on that throne. God is Great! For this purpose, there should be powerful leaders like you. I trust you completely. That's why the PSO has decided to make tunnels in your forests... so that our arms and ammunition can be easily transported to India. My jungle is your jungle. Easy... that's no problem. Where did he get hold of such wild men? Go away. Take it away. Tulsi! How long will you continue to break your head at the temple? Who'll wash the utensils and the clothes? Today was the final fast for Monday. I've completed it. Goodness! Whether you undergo a penance for 16 Mondays... or 16 Fridays, you will never find a husband for yourself. I get worried whenever I see your problems. How long can I continue to be a burden on you? Last night, Lord Shiva appeared in my dreams. That's enough. Now you'll start chattering away. Come on. Go home and work. I'll go and buy some soap. Nice village. Isn't it, buddy? Why do you start glowing whenever you see a girl? It was my mother's last wish that I should have a family. Dada Thakur will fulfill the last wish of your mother. He will! Let's go and lie down. - There you go. To turn from a criminal to a policeman... it's very important for them to learn certain rules and disciplines. Yes. To fight the Kauravas, one must possess the strength of Pandavas. Their training for the battle with death should begin from tomorrow. Hear that? - I'm hearing. The old man wants martyrdom for us. He's a naive fool. - How's that? He trusted us too easily. - What do you mean? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? What is that? - About escaping from here. Shall I ask you something? - What? How do two scoundrels think alike?! I was also plotting an escape from here. How will that be? - Look over there. When I was in the circus, I used to play 'animals'. C'mon! Let's get cracking. They're missing since morning. Looks like they've escaped. Don't fire! A bear! The bear! Why don't you understand that I'm human? Please don't shoot. I beg of you. Look how I shoot now... Where the hell is he? She's crazy... I must find a place to hide! Look! A bear! Run! Well, cutie pie? I told you several times not to fire, but you don't listen! Don't you have any sense? Shall I tell you what's there inside this skin? And where are you going away? Look at me before you leave. We were playing 'animals'. Idiot! Scoundrel! Loafer! Don't get abusive. I'm a crazy fellow, you see! Worthless man! Do you know who I am? You're a rude, useless and an arrogant girl. I'm the daughter of the owner of this jungle. Daughter of the owner of his jungle? You look like the daughter of a wild animal of this jungle. It's necessary that... a wild girl be treated savagely. The name is Baiju. Understand? Hurry up! C'mon! Come on! The moment you see a girl, you start glowing all over. We're running away in an officer's uniform. Somebody could catch us! Nobody can catch us. - Let's carry on! Careful! The terrorists are here! Run! The terrorists have arrived! Your life and death are in my hand. C'mon! You've landed us in a soup! You and your crazy ideas. Hey! Stop! The crow's are making a lot of noise. Do I bump them off? Let them be. The scoundrels have realised their folly. Yes, they've returned. Such scoundrels ought to be shot. They're savages! They're not savages. They've come as the officers of our jungles. From Delhi. From Delhi? Radha, go upstairs. But Uncle... - I said, go on! I wonder what kind of training they're receiving on the hills. God is Great! Glory to Lord Hanuman! Where will you go? I made six rounds. The fourth round was incorrect. The rest was fine. That's your shortcoming. Use your brains. Before speaking to the enemy, estimate his strength and weakness. Think, understand... and then launch an attack. Hear what he says? - What? Think, understand, estimate... By then, the enemy will gun us down! The old man's going to get us killed! Greetings. - Greetings. It's my bad luck, really. You officers arrived in my area, but I couldn't welcome you. It's my bad luck. My name is B.M.S. Kittam Kittu. He owns this jungle. The moment he learnt... that you've newly arrived here, he came rushing here. He's very fond of government officials. He's a very religious person. The entire village respects him. Please don't say that. God is Great! I'm a small man. Please visit my house. - Pardon me? A small party at my home? We've just arrived. We haven't even started our work as yet. These officers will first get trained and then... What training, sir? You must be knowing about... the wild animals in the jungles around the border. That's why I want you to come to my guest house. Very big house! Very safe house! He has asked me to open the guest house for you. My humble house also belongs to you, Sir. Your house is my house. My house is your house. Please do visit my house! We'll organise a party. Good-bye. That chap in the lungi appeared to be a bastard! You'd better do something. - Yes? Keep an eye on his guest house. Should he create mischief, do I take him on? Just do what I say. This is just one gold necklace. If you get Tulsi married to Somu... I'll weigh you in gold. Really? I'll have to show Tulsi a dream to convince her. What're you saying, Aunty? - It's the truth. Last night, Lord Shiva had Himself appeared in my dreams. What did he say? He said the first boy I come across on the banks of the river Parul... on the Sankranti day, will be my husband. Really? - Has Lord Shiva ever lied? No. But... - But what? I'll see you off as a bride! I'm sure, smugglers are carrying gold in the palanquin. I nab the smugglers... And Dada Thakur's gonna be happy! Out, smuggler! What's this? Lord Shiva's orders! You're my husband and I'm your wife. My wife? - Yes. What drama is this?! The first man I meet today on the banks of river Parul... will be my husband. That's our destiny. This girl will sure take me to the wrong places! She's touching my feet too! Run away... let me scram! Listen! The garland! I can't let is lose! It will emerge victorious, Tulsi! No! This garland is not meant for you. It's for him. He's a fake. I'm the original. Get in now. Your aunty is waiting for you. My aunty? - Yes. Carry the palanquin. You're my bride. And you're still acting tough with me. I don't like your tantrums. Where are you going? No! Please don't! What's going on? If the girl is not willing, why are you using force? She's my fiance. But who the hell are you? You'd better get lost. - Me? Who am I? The name is Johny. You're hitting me? He's hitting me! Take this, you scoundrel. He was hitting me! No! Don't mess with them. They're not nice people. Go and sit in the palanquin. Glory to Lord Hanuman. Baldy! What're you doing?! Set me down! I'll die! Where are you flinging me? Well? What are you doing here? - I was waiting for you! Look! Isn't he turning into a monkey? If you want to fight, do it properly. Take this! And this! Don't spare the baldy! Don't spare him. Scoundrels! Get your guns out! Finish them! See? Plenty of guns around! They were molesting the girl, Khairu! There are rats hidden in each and every corner. This is my hand. Do you know why it was broken? Because I've used this hand a shoot a lot of rounds. I've committed several murders. They can have the bullets later. But what do we do with the nuisance? Send her home first. - Sure. Go ahead. Why send her alone? These brothers will escort their sister home. C'mon. Take your sister home. Move it, guys. Carry the palanquin. They will also beg her for forgiveness! Speak up, children! Forgive us, sister! - Speak up! Forgive us, sister! And what could we've done? Allowed the girl to be raped? The first good deed of my life! And I get a scolding for it! Oh no. Violence is a good thing. Carry on! Be prepared. They'll return with knives and choppers. We'll face them. Let them come. We'll chop them into pieces. You cannot make enemies if you want to achieve what you propose to. There's a lot of hanky-panky at the circuit house. It'll make things easier for us. - I swear. Fools, all of you! To know the secrets of your enemy, you must first befriend him. There's only one way now of setting this matter right. One of you will go to Kittam Kittoo and apologise. All right. If you insist, I'II... Not you. You won't go there. You'll go to him, Birju. Me? And ask for pardon. Politely. Didn't I tell you that the boss has gone out? Why're you being rude? Speak softly. I've urgent work with him. - My boss has no time for loafers. How dare you call me a loafer?! One slap, and I could paste the map of Nashik jail on your face! This is the same man who was playing a bear! Forgive me, Sir. - That's more like it. That's what I'm here for. Do you understand? I'll leaving now. Quiet. Just watch Radha's act. Yes? Whom do you want to see? Aren't you the same? I understand. I'm not the one, you think I am. Then? I'm Radha, Reeta's twin sister. Yes. That's Reeta. People are often mistaken. Damn it! It's a double role! You had me confused! This is what happens in our movies, you know! You play the sitar very well. You sing well, too. My mother used to sing very well. As for me, I play the banjo. That's nice indeed. Yes. It's nice indeed. May I go now? - Very well. And yes! - Yes? When Kittam Kittoo, your uncle, returns... tell him that I'd come to ask for pardon. Sure! I'm leaving now. - All right. What say? How dare you get in there by force? I came to ask for pardon. - This isn't your father's house! Don't you drag my father into this! Who the hell is your father? I'd only come to ask for forgiveness. Is this how you ask for forgiveness? I'd gone there to ask for forgiveness, but that bastard... Now what if I ask you for forgiveness? I haven't come across prisoners more disciplined and calm They sing your patriotic song day in and day out Don't worry about me My destination maybe far; but it is not unachievable I hear that our Minister is coming to attend a party here Ask him to act like a stranger with me. Not to talk with me Why must I talk to him? I'll only watch. Tripathi is said to be arriving. Dr. Dang wants our coconut to be gifted to him. Very well, sir. But when are you arriving? I'll arrive the next day after the party. You're attending Kittam Kittoo's party. Take the boys along, too. Such tramps have no place there. - Exactly! They create trouble everywhere they go. It's an insult to take such chaps along. Keep them here, in your company. There will be several big guys at the party. First teach them etiquette. Then we'll take them along. A man of etiquette indeed! If only our mother were alive... - Mother! Your mother is still here. Come with me. If he can make a gentleman out of Khairu, I can do so out of you! This is Jolly Jagga's cupboard. Which area does the bandit operate in? - He's not a bandit. He's Dharma's brother. Whenever he goes abroad, he leaves his clothes here. Dresses? What do we do with them? Exchange them for utensils? I'll tell you. I have influential guests from Delhi and abroad. Thank you, Mr. Tripathi. Our area is very peaceful. You can ask Dada Thakur. This is an official visit. I must make sure everything's all right. It's the custom here to give the guests a traditional welcome. Radha. Give the guests the prasadam. This is my daughter, Radha. This is a sacred coconut from the sage of the Himalayas. Take it home, and keep it in your room of worship. It'll bless you with peace and prosperity. His underlings aren't here yet. Me's Johny, from Jhansi. That's Baiju. From Mumbai. He's trying to be funny. - No funny! He's Johny! What is she saying? - She says you're handsome. Dada Thakur has asked the two of you to get the hell out of here. Tell Dada Thakur that we'll stick to this quiet corner. We won't create any scene. No liquor. No violence. And no abuses. This is whiskey, ma'am! - Just do as I say. Some people prefer it neat. Excuse me, You're my guests. To welcome you... No liquor, thank you! - Not liquor. This is orange juice. We drink plenty of juice. This is our own orange juice! Let's have another of that juice! I don't see your twin-sister around. She hasn't come. She's gone hunting. She belongs there! What a difference between the two girls! Aim your camera at the man there, and take your pictures. Didn't I tell you to keep quiet and just watch? Where have I said anything? I'm just watching. The rains pouring outside... What makes the ocean; and what makes this wine? What life is this? This is no life! Let me put the bottle to my mouth and take a swig It's after ages that I've got to see the stuff... Give it to me... give me the booze It's after ages that I have got my hands on the stuff Blow us out of our senses, give us the booze Give it to me, give me the booze Long live, Baiju! When I've had a few drinks it'll make things go haywire Let us drink... let us cry and laugh It will do away with all formalities It will weigh everyone for what they are worth We're called bad guys... But we're true at heart Kill us, if we're lying It's after ages that we're getting to drink Give it to me, give me the booze Long live, Johny We've just come to our senses We're getting into the spirit To set water on fire We have got to know something The kick has begun to tell The lady will take the veil off her face We haven't yet landed a blow or two... It's days since we've been into a brawl We're gonna beat up someone today... after we're drunk Give it to us, give us the booze It's days since we've drunk the stuff Sir! The birds have flown the coop As if every promise has been broken There... the gentleman is cross with us! There are men here... They're fair of skin... But black at heart They strike up shady deals with strangers And betray people their own All those enemies and traitors... we shall teach a lesson They will never forget us Go on, give it to us... give us the booze It's days since we've gulped down some stuff Long live Kittam Kittu Give us the booze, Kittam Kittu He told us not to drink! And now we're sweating it out! Spare me... please! Left, right... my foot! He won't do it himself! Attention! Look who's here, Dada Thakur! My brother! Didn't I tell you he's achieved a lot in Europe? Good morning, sir. Brother tells me that you were our father's friend in Lahore. More than friends, we were brothers, my son. Is this is the brother for whom... Yes. I went to prison for him. Touch his feet. You ought to touch the feet of your God-like brother. He has granted you a new life. Who are they? - Our officers. They are here to inspect the jungle. You come and go in a jiffy. It would be better if you stayed for a few more days. Before I leave, I'll tell you something. It's not advisable to let strangers stay at home. They're not strangers. They're our own people. You're a naive man. - So be it. Time will tell who are our people, and who are strangers. My obeisances. - May you live long. Return soon. And eat on time! How often have I asked you not to come at this post? The baby's crying, she wanted to come here. So I brought her along. Go home, my child. I'll return soon. This post... how come? It has been set up a few days ago. I must say, Rana. I haven't seen more patriotic men. Now listen, politician! Don't instigate my wife against me! God save you now. - I want to talk to her. I was praising you, too. Here you are. He's eager to talk to you. Hello! Rukmini! This chap is a pessimist! Don't let him con you! Everything's all right out there, isn't it? Say something... I get it! All right, I do! I can hear your bangles. Did you think I won't? Of course... you want to know how I am. Right? I'm fine. Absolutely right! What was that? Come again. I'm always missing you, darling. Don't ask me that again! I have always said, I love you A father of three... and I love you Now listen, Rukmini. How can I continue, if you act like this? I'll be a shattered man. Don't forget... it was you who saw me off on the mission. I'll return soon. And I'll return victorious. Rana Vishwapratap! If we get to know where he's disappeared after resigning... it would be great fun. But Tripathi was saved this time. - Never mind. We'll get him again. Why're the prisoners standing here? - They're our new prisoners. They're refusing to work on the new tunnel. What is this I hear? You're Indian boys, after all. What would you lose if you dig a tunnel? And remember, we've special principles for prisoners. If you work, you'll be given bread to eat. If you don't, you'll be given bullets. Several of our officers have been caught or killed by them. If we visit the jungles of Lahariya, we must go there together. Now where has Baiju gone? He's went with his instrument this morning. Hear that? Banjo! Pamper him some more! Your admirer is playing the banjo outside. Hey, girls! Who do you think you are? Do I look like a beggar? Do kings and emperors play musical instruments on the streets? What kind of girls you are? You don't even know that... ... one can express his devotion by playing musical instruments. No. It's not nice to make fun of devotees. There! Look at you! And this girl... bless her! But how can we believe that he is a devotee? Which God do you worship? - I believe in... well! Radha... Which God do you worship? She worships Lord Ram. - I'm a devotee of Lord Ram, too! The principled Lord Rama! But Radha's deity was Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna? Actually, Lord Ram was very simple and innocent... while Lord Krishna was very clever and practical. If I search within myself, I'm more inclined towards Lord Krishna. What say, Miss Radha? They're all lying. Actually, I worship Goddess Santoshi. Santoshi Maa! It ran 50 weeks in Bombay. I've seen it 21 times myself. I don't even know how many Fridays I've fasted to appease the Goddess. To be honest, I'm a devotee of Goddess Santoshi Maa. What's there to laugh about? Glory to Goddess Santoshi Maa! Look what's happening there! We're on duty! And he's busy romancing... the Romeo! Trying to impress the girl with his banjo! C'mon! My Lord has arrived, you see. Glory to Mother Santoshi! Johny's lying! I was only... Get in. Shut up, you fox! If he carries on like this, the truth about us will be exposed. People will get to know our true identities. Stop the truck! Look! The post is up in flames. How did this happen? - The same thing again, Sir. Terrorists from across the border blew up the post with dynamite. There was peace for a while, but their atrocities have resumed. They're spreading terror... They've burnt down the post today. It could be our house tomorrow. You took time to understand. They're called terrorists. Which means we'll have more careful now. It's important that the boys take turns to stand guard... and see what kind of people and goods enter the village. You're right. They are likely to notice us anytime now. Yes. More so because we're government officials. What say? Certainly. You do appear to be a government official. Yes, I do. That's because I do my duty! I don't play banjo like you do! All right... I'll make a nice banjo out of you soon. Really? Go ahead then! Go on! Hello there! Whom were you looking for? I was looking for my aunt. Is it the aunt... or is it uncle? I know. I know everything. You're looking for Gyaneshwar Prasad, aren't you? He's gone to the jungles to kill a partridge. By the way, he praises you a lot. - Does he? Yes, but the poor chap cannot make you his wife. Why not? - He was right when he said that... a bachelor needs a house if he has to become a husband. And to buy a house, one needs money. And he has no money. What then? If he had money, there'd be a home. And love. And a beloved. But what will the poor guy do? So? - What else? You know better. He needs money. Without it, he can't marry. You're in so much of trouble, my love. Why didn't you tell me about it? What a fool I am! Love is meant for good-for-nothings. I haven't seen a more lazy animal than someone in love. How would you know? When love reigns, even the heavens tremble. May I ask you something? You loved Heena a lot, didn't you? A lot? And still do? Tell me. C'mon. You must be missing her a lot. I haven't forgotten. What do I tell you? Love and romance have no place in my destiny! How would you? You don't know how to love. Don't I love you guys? Love? This is not love. It's your helplessness. Helplessness? Am I begging you for something? You son of a scoundrel! Do I not love you? Shall I tear open my heart and show it to you? Hey! Look who's come! My God! Why doesn't she leave me alone! Know what, guy? Go over... She's brought the green stuff too! She seems to be a good girl. Don't betray her. Today, whatever I say, will be the truth. What is it? Actually... - You see... You're bringing me a lot of bad name! It's you who's bringing me to disrepute. When Lord Ram was in distress... didn't He share his grief with His consort? What do you mean? You need money for a home, don't you? I've brought this for you. Where did you get it from? My late mother had kept this for my marriage. And when your Aunty gets to know about it, she'll skin you alive. I'll bear it, but your grief... Grief? You're adding to my grief! Remember! I'm not what I appear to be. I'm dangerous. And a fraud, too. And I cannot be of any use to you. Shut up and get lost! I'll leave, if you want me to. But keep this... What does she think I am? A cheat? A fraud? Am I eyeing her money? Here... this is how I can make money! When Lord Ram was in distress... didn't He share his grief with His consort? Aren't you getting sleep? Drink this and go to sleep. We've to leave for the forests tomorrow. Lord! What mistake have I made? He still refuses to accept me! That's because you're a fool! I... Is your aunt at home? - She's not in. Last evening, I was... - Yes. I was drunk. What I meant to say is that... I am... with you... How should I say it? Gawd! Why can't I speak those romantic lines?! You see... this is the letter. Read it. I'm leaving. Listen... I belong to you. And you belong to me But my life is ridden with danger. I'm not sure if I'll return If I return, I'll be yours. Or else, it's a good-bye Don't go away... Oh my darling, don't cry... I'm going to die Bye-bye Don't go away... Do not hurt my feelings My love... do not go away No, no! Don't sing a sad song Don't say such sad things I'll never leave you. Impossible My heart is a temple of your love... my heart is a temple of your love... come, live in my heart O mischievous soul... why must you wander aimlessly? My love, do not go away If the lovers are separated... if this bond of love is severed... I'd go crazy in your love... And you'd get word of it My love... don't go away Don't hurt my feelings My love... I've come to you Do not go away Wake up, Johny. We're home. Go home, dear. As for you... come in. I swear! I was only spying. Didn't you ask me to One has to do many things for that! One has to sing, woo a girl, even enter the girl's home. A no-win situation for me! I get the boot, no matter what! She's a nice girl. - What? She's a nice girl. - A nice girl? A very nice girl. You can't find a better girl in the whole of U.P. I'm thinking of discussing your marriage with her. Godfather! Better do that! That'll end the whole controversy. But what will you say? - I'll say... that I'm sending you back where I brought you from. And where did you bring me from? - I brought you from here. Have you forgotten?! - You had promised me a new life! But you're sending me back to the gallows! I was only talking about love and romance. Now listen carefully. You will stop spying and romancing with immediate effect. Neither does it serve any purpose, nor can I bear it any cost. But... you'll give me a report on all the activities... and also where the roads in jungle lead to. In 3 days. This jungle is the private property of Kittam Kittoo. Entry is strictly prohibited. Believe it or not! But the key to our problems is Kittam Kittoo. Don't utter that name, damn you! Every time you do that it reminds me of Radha. This job can be done. - How? I'm talking of the same Radha. Once you become Radha's husband, Kittam Kittoo will be our in-law. What say? You guys won't change? - No. Scoundrels, really! Kittam Kittoo is very busy today. I told you... you cannot meet him. - Can we meet his niece, Radha? Why not? - Because... she's just returned from a hunt and is bathing in the pool. Returned from hunting? Radha has returned from the hunt! You see, we're letting you into a secret, and you aren't listening. Go and fetch my clothes. Yes? Oh! Hello! Did you go hunting? - Not at all. What're you doing here? - I was praying. Where's Reeta? - She must be in there. I'll convey your idea to Kittam Kittoo. I cannot come out into the open and speak to you. Who's the girl in the nude? - That's Radha. And where's Reeta? - Reeta who? Radha's twin sister! - Radha has no sister. Kittam Kittoo has only one niece. - I see. All right then. At the temple. - Yes. We'll surely meet. I'll meet you there. - Sure! He loves Radha as much as he hates Reeta. What are you saying? - I swear it. Don't swear. Just speak the truth. I'm speaking the truth. Radha and Reeta are the same girl! She's pulling your leg by playing a double role. I see... Now just see how I start pulling that girl's leg. Greetings. - Greetings. You responded to my greetings with a greeting? Why? Do you want something from me? No. In fact, I'm in a fix today. And I need your help desperately. You need my help? - That's right. Tell me. What is it? - The thing is, last night... I married your sister Radha in the temple. Married her? - I swear it. She told me that she would return with her clothes. But she hasn't returned yet. Did you hear what he said? He says that last night he married my sister, Radha, in the temple. You're laughing?! I'm turning a widower... and you're laughing? Stop this merriment! Don't you act smart, mister! And listen carefully. I'm Reeta and I'm Radha, too. Now stage your act elsewhere. You? Radha? You're not half as good as Radha. Radha is a Goddess, while you're a witch. Radha is brilliance, you are darkness. Better watch your tongue. - It cannot be controlled now. Attention, everybody! Listen to my sad story! Ask the priest who got me married. Ask the horse which I rode on. Ask my friend who is witness that Radha is my wife. I want nothing but my wife! You need not insult me by screaming like this in the marketplace. If it is revenge you want, take me to some other place. It's you who's insulting me and my love for Radha. We got married, we had our nuptials together. He's on the right track. We even decided to name our son Prem Kumar Thakur. You're crossing the limits. Didn't I tell you that I'm the same girl whom you believe is Radha? You? Then was I dreaming? You've gone mad. You've gone insane. Really? - Yes. There's the Shiva temple. Come with me, and speak on oath that you're Radha. Let's go. I swear upon Lord Shiva that Radha and Reeta are the same girl... and I'm that girl. Then speak on oath that the girl who is Radha, used to hate me. What do you mean? - It means that... you don't love me. Lord Shiva! Why isn't she taking the oath? It means that she... It only means that... Since you left, sir... Dada Thakur's men have created havoc in the village. They harass us girls a lot. They won't harass you henceforth. But you'll have to do something. What is that, Sir? Plant yourself like a pest in Dharma Mansion. Use this tape-recorder as one of your ears. Also inform me every day, what is cooking there. As you wish, Sir. This is not good. Dada Thakur will be very angry. I swear, Khairu. Radha is a very nice girl. Then don't cheat her. First tell her who you are, and why you have come here. Then see how much she loves you. My father was killed by terrorists in this very jungle. Why? - Because he was a patriot... and an honest human being. I too want to tell you the truth about myself. The purpose of my visit here... I don't even know if I'll remain alive for you. No! Don't utter another word. Radha! Come here! He's a loafer! And you're a rich man's daughter! Before that... - Shut up! If you meet him again, I'll shoot both of you! You must forget that girl! I've got to know about it. - There's no doubt about that, sir. This is cheating. A betrayal! Betrayal? It's my destiny that has betrayed me, sir. You have written this destiny for yourself! Remember. We have a mission. If we face any kind of storm before we accomplish that... you alone will be responsible for it. And you won't even have the opportunity to seek forgiveness. Sir! My love... sweetheart... Do not poke fun at me like this I'm in no way what your sweetheart should be Become like him. That's what you must do... or make me the way you are I have sought you from God Come, make me your bride, O beloved Come and make me your wife I have sought you from God Do not give up the riches of your love... for this worthless toy of clay Lovers, in this world... forsake all that is theirs They forsake their world Tell me once... to come to you Come to me If I do not come at your call, I shall be called unfaithful I'm a poor, homeless wandering soul... who shall ever manage to keep pace with me? There will be times when I miss you And that will take away my life How could you seek that, my love? For, I haven't given you the right to die Live a hundred years, I will, for you Or else, I'll poison myself I have sought you from God Come, make me your bride I have entrusted to you my body and soul You have bought me over I have sought you from God We shall never break, O Lord Separate, we might... but not in souls Why did you do it, sir? It was necessary. Listen to me, sir. Let them return to their world of love. They want to live, sir. Your companions are supposed to be soldiers; not lovers. Love is a gift of God, sir. Should anything be achieved at the cost of love and emotions... it will not be acceptable to God. - They made some promises to me. The promises will be fulfilled. I'm with you. Blow my head away... and, by God, I will not complain! Grant them their life, sir. Release them. You seem to have forgotten that I've left behind my office. But I still realise my responsibilities. And there is no place for cheap behaviour in my scheme of things. You're speaking just like a politician. Who, seated on his chair... thrusts thousands into a war, for his own ego and pride... and calls them soldiers. All he sends the soldier's widow and folks, later... is a letter of consolation, a little money and a medal! You are an ignorant man. Keep your views to yourself. For, every soldier knows... that his uniform can even be his shroud. How right you are! And should he wish to escape the shroud of death... leaders like you would bury him alive! But Johny and Baiju are not even your soldiers! They're merely prisoners. Whom you have granted life in charity. You have. As a jailor. For a jailor, a prisoner's life is as precious... as that of a goat in a slaughterhouse! They are slaughtered every day... but no one casts a look of sympathy at their plight. They want to cry... they want to live! As for these prisoners, they aren't even sheep for you. You think they're dogs... mere dogs! Only to have another medal added to your already decorated uniform! Only because these dogs can avenge for you... the death of your children! Now listen to what I have to say. My name is Vishwapratap Singh. Singh means a lion. I've lived like a lion, and I'll die like a lion. And a lion does not need dogs to protect his children. He can take revenge on his own. I can forget fools like you... but I cannot forget those 380 prisoners in the prison... who were dear to me like my children... and who were shot to death by the PSO within those four walls. I will fight for them. I will go to the enemy on my own. I don't want those weak-kneed lovers... who drop their weapons as soon as they fall in love. I don't want them. The PSO told me the same thing. Rexson told me the same thing. He told me to kill my emotions! They asked me to pick up the gun and slay Heena! What's the difference between you and Rexson then? We're prisoners, after all. And prisoners we will be! We can never get our freedom! We will never be freed. When a man goes blind... he can't tell the difference between night and day. But there will be a day when realisation will dawn upon you... and you'll be able to see the difference. Vishwanath Pratap Singh will take on the enemy, all alone! I don't need such frivolous lovers... who give up arms the moment they fall in love! I want Rana's men... dead or alive! What have you decided? Revolt. And you? - Just what you have decided. You come first; everyone else comes after you You are my effort and my culmination I shall live and die for you, O love... I've brought this shawl for you. Muniyatai said you're running a fever. Tell her, I'm all right. I will not die so easily. Aren't you coming home? Muniyatai has made food for you. What's the point in talking about such things? I got carried away last night and spoke a bit too much. If we were your sons, wouldn't you have forgiven us? Go home, Dada Thakur. Please. I'll bring them home, too. It's no use, Sir. They've been drinking the whole night. They've knocked off three bottles. They won't wake up for another 5 hours. I've seen it all. Give me that remote control. Now that you've seen it... you must realise that how close death is. I can see and understand the tricks of the enemy. They've handed over guns to our children... so that they can fire at our own kith and kin. I don't want you. I want those three prisoners you've brought. They're not prisoners; they are my sons. I've pledged to kill them. And I've pledged to protect them. You'll be dead, too. Now that we see our own children turn terrorists... which parent would want to live anymore? Wake up! Dada Thakur's life is in danger! And you're sleeping?! Damn this hand! Bastards! Twenty of you against one man?! Open the bloody door, if you're man enough! Dada Thakur! Open the door! Get away from that window, Khairu! Open the door, Dada Thakur! How did this happen?! You're okay, aren't you? Have you had a dream? Don't worry. Your husband will be all right. Want to go to him? You can't. Not till my husband returns from Kanpur, I can't let you go. Doctor? I'm sorry. I cannot say whether he will survive. Can't you say?! And how will he not survive?! What kind of a doctor are you to say, you're not sure?! Of what use is this bloody hospital?! Throw away that white coat! Burn down this hospital... if you cannot save even one patient! Do we bring a patient here to give up hope?! Calm down. - I'll see how he doesn't survive! Let's pray to God. - He'll have to live. You are my faith; you are my religion I mean everything to you and you mean everything to me Every deed of mine... shall be for you, dear nation My heart is already yours I will also lay down my life for you, O Motherland I've given my heart to you. I'll give my to you, too God isn't great this time, sir! Dada Thakur has regained consciousness. And I'm in a soup! I'm coming over to you, Dr Dang. It's not safe for me to stay here anymore. I'm telling you the truth! We only want Dr. Dang's whereabouts. I'll tell you! You cannot meet Dada Thakur. They've come from a far off place. It's very important to Dada Thakur. The visiting hours for the guests is already over. They're not guests. Tell him that his wife and his son have come to meet him. Do you wish to see Dada Thakur? - Yes, Doctor. Come along. I'll take you to him. Stay here. - Go on. And come back soon. What's all this? Why is it dark in here? You're as shocked to see me here as I am glad to meet you. Well? You've been enjoying it, haven't you? Don't you worry! I haven't come here to kill you. I want to keep you alive. For a long time, too. Till such time as every desire in you... and your sense of pride is buried with you. I want to keep you alive, till your tricolour... of which you are so proud, goes down on its own. You probably take the tricolor to be a yard of mere cloth, Dr Dang. It has taken the blood of millions of martyrs to take its form. It's the pride of a billion Indians. Try to touch it, and you'll burn to ashes. Ashes? It was I who showed you the ashes, Rana. At the crematorium... the remains of your children; your prisoners and your ideals. Have you already forgotten the sight? The funeral-pyre? The ashes? The ashes you speak of have already turned into dynamite. Dynamite? You mean your three prisoners, who are here to eliminate me? Those apes are heading towards my camp. To be blown up by the explosives I've laid. Which means they have reached the evil empire. Sure, they have. They're taking the Holy Mother with them, too. Would you like to know which Holy Mother? Give him a glimpse. You scoundrel! Leave him alone! Let me go! You scoundrel! No! Don't kill him! He must stay alive, I say! To weep! And to burn the bodies of his children, his prisoners! I want him to die a painful death. I want to remind him of the echo of the slap. The echo of the slap! Every time we meet... and we will meet. We will meet very often. I'm speaking from the Electric House. Please send the jeep over quickly. Stay here, okay? What happened? - It's all happening! Hands up, and take us to your den! Dada Thakur asks us to understand things... and then head for the enemy base. C'mon... show us your base. - Come on! Gyaneshwar! Here I come! You?! Khairu! She's going to be the end of us! Go away! Get lost, silly girl! - Hang on... Tulsi... come here. Officer are cautioned that secret agents of the enemy... are trying to enter our base. Officers must show their identity cards on demand. Go! Everything okay? - Okay, sir. He's had a heart attack! He's been dead for half-an-hour. Who brought him in here? Victory to India! - Victory to India! No one will come in or go out! Are they already in? No, sir. There's nobody on the CC-TV. They're all our men. Show me the prisoners section. Quick. Long live Nihal Singh! Look at me carefully. Indian forces have gained entry. What? - Victory to India! The security officers are on alert to welcome Dr. Dang. They will escort Dr. Dang inside. At a little distance from here is the Red Tower... which contains so much of explosives... that the PSO can fight for 16 days at a stretch. If this building is blown up, the PSO will be wiped out. Why drink so much of beer that you lose control over yourself? What happened? - We often have a power failure here. I've intimated the Red Tower. Since work on the tunnel is on, power failure is common occurrence. Where had you hidden this precious diamond? Fools! Asses! To have bound you in these chains! This beautiful body ought to be adorned with gold jewellery. Your body is beautiful... and indeed intoxicating. Release her. And bring her to my chamber. I have sought you from God Make me your bride, my love He's Rana's man! Don't, Baiju! They'll kill you! No! Hold it, Baiju! I beg of you! Please let him go! Please let him go. Spray those bullets in his chest! - No! Hold the fire! We've got to find his two other friends. Call out to your colleagues. Must I? - Of course. Call them! Friends! I'm a poor son of India! A prisoner! I have pledged to Dada Thakur... that I will take this devil's head to my soil... and every drop of my blood will call out till the end... Victory to India Victory to India! Victory to India! Hold it! No! Don't, Khairu! Khairuddin Kisti. Remember that! Count till five. We won't wait any longer. Five, six, seven and eight! My Lord! I'm coming over! God Almighty! Don't do this! I was about to surrender anyway! I'm a very poor man. These bastards talked me into trouble! To hell with Johny! And to hell with you! He said that we'd play 'soldier soldier'. But I don't want to be a soldier! Here's the cap... and the uniform! I swear, sir! By your mother! I'm not lying! Send me back home... I was very happy back there! I beg of you... let me return! Release me! Let go of my feet. - I won't! I want to live! I'm scared of death! I have little children, a mother, my sisters. I beg of you, Sir! Don't you move, you son-of-a-crow! Ask your guys to drop their guns! Drop your guns! Move now... with your arms raised and legs on the ground! Move! The tables have turned! Wow! Had my mother been around, she'd have been thrilled with me! Now, guys... you will repeat just what I want you to! Dr. Dang... Shame! Shame! Gentlemen! Some of your dear ones are our guests! Meet them first! Look carefully. There are bombs tied to their hands. And I hold the remote control. You guys are now in control. You can let them die, if you wish. Or let them live, too. Wisdom now lies in releasing me. We'll have to let him go. Every deed we shall do, for you, beloved nation This is my battle. You must not get involved. You have done your job. No family with a traitor like Jagga... can ever think it has done its job. Such families are finished. My job begins now. Dada Thakur... Khairu has sent this note for you. What are you guys doing?! Throwing a girl like that? Get out, fools! Now look, Radha. You love a guy who loves his nation. And I... I love you. It's love at first sight. Indian girls have always been my weakness. They do things to me. I'll let them go. I'll do just as you say. But, for once... you must be my Queen. It'll be great fun. What say? Okay? Hey, lady! What're you doing here? I've come to look for my husband. The villagers say you're holding him captive. How did you cross the border? That man in the bus gave me a ride. Come on out, whoever's in there! Go back from here. Hurry up! Victory to India! O love... To make my love come true, I'm willing to stand any test For, the life of a nightingale, belongs in the gardens I'm fire. I'm lightning I'm out to stake my life To set the enemy on fire No one in the world has known me yet I'd rather have myself beheaded, then bow to someone I'd rather die for India The nightingale, after all, lives for its land Victory to India! Fire! Fire! Call the fire brigade! Put out this fire! Khairu's dead. His body's lying in the compound. Every deed of ours shall be for you, O Motherland Our heart is yours; we'll give you our lives, too Who's bombing us? - It's an Indian carrier. Step aside, Sardar. And send the girl over to me. You bastard! You scoundrel! Run away! Oh God... Send the ammunition immediately! C'mon! That's the red tower, which stocks 90?/? of the explosives. Who told you? - Nihal Singh. If the building is not blown up in 15 minutes, we're in danger. But how do we blow it up? There is a way. We're sending the explosives, sir. Who's that? Why is our truck returning? Where are you taking the truck? - To blow up the Red Tower. We're carrying explosives in this truck, Khairu! We'll be blown up with the tower! - Not you... it'll only be me. No, Khairu! Let's find another way. There is no other away. Get down, both of you. No, Khairu! If you go, we come with you! Don't talk like a fool! You've got to save mother and the others. How about your life? - Don't worry about my life. I have no one. You guys have to settle down! You have promises to keep! This is where my promise ends. No! - No! Get down, I say! - No! Stop the truck! Get down, I say! - No! I won't let you go alone! You have cheated us! This is a betrayal! No, don't cry. We'll do what he was supposed to do. We will not spare them! We swear on your love! We'll raze Dr. Dang's evil empire to ashes! Alert the Red Tower immediately. And when is my plane arriving? In 15 minutes, Sir. Dr. Dang has never conceded defeat. In a matter of 15 minutes, everything will turn to ashes. Do you hear the echo? Do you? It's the echo of the explosives... you showered on the unarmed inmates of my prison. It echoes the cries of the orphaned children and the widows! This is the echo of India... whom you wanted to destroy. And today, you are in India's clutches, Dr Dang. Well, Dang? Was that fun? Did you really believe that you could destroy the country? Did you really think so? No! It's impossible. Impossible! Whenever demons like you set foot on our soil... our tricolour will make sure it wipes them out! Brother! You swine! You're in my hands today! Don't shoot, Johny! You've done a wise thing by not killing me. Perhaps you forget that your wife and child are in my custody. They'll be dead in another 4 or 5 minutes... when my time bomb explodes. Come to your senses! You're a brave soldier. Go to your son. He's waiting for you. Go on! Won't you? Mother! Could you find Mother? - No, I couldn't. Look over there. I'll search this side over. Mother! My son! Mother! Good-bye, Rana! You have amply proved... that man assumes greatness only with his deeds. Be it a criminal or a soldier. - Everyone thirsts for love. Have you given them your love then? They've received a new lease of life. They can go wherever they wish. It's a big world. What do you mean? Where will we go?! Did you hear that, Mother? When we wanted to run away, he locked us up! He forced us to have milk; and scolded us, too. Now that we want to stay at home... he asks us to go away in the big, bad world. This isn't fair. You have given us a new life, and lots of love, too. Tell us on oath that you didn't consider us to be your sons? Did you see how cunning they are? Come on! - Where to? Over there! I'll fulfill Khairu's dream for you. Live and die for you, I shall, O love I've given you my heart I will lay down my life for you, too
