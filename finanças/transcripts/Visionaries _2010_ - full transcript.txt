My name is Jonas. I came from far away and I ended up here talking about cinema. But I don't really know what cinema is. Cinema is constantly expanding, branching out into new forms. The language is growing and changing and what we one day consider "this is it," next day somebody else comes in and pushes cinema into another direction so we are all at the beginning. This is The Bridge in New York, one of several small theaters around the country where underground films are shown, and their devotees range from serious students of cinematography to the society's swingers of the jet set. One of the most publicized of the underground films is Sleep by pop artist Andy Warhol: six and a half hours of a man sleeping. Andy, Why is it you're making these films? Well it's just easier to do, it's easier to do than painting. Well because the camera has a motor and you just turn it on and you just walk away and it just takes all by itself. I screened most of Andy's films. At first they like are perplexed then like get angry. Why is this continued because they feel they got everything that there is. Because they consider there is nothing much. Then as time goes and those who stay, those who remain, they begin to relax and the images, they begin to work on them in time. It's a movie, so we're trained pretty much to think that we ought to get it, and if you don't get it, you feel like you're like stupid, you feel like maybe other people around you do get it, and until you start to get it or until you know that nobody got it, there's that kind of discomfort. You have to be more patient, you have to be more thoughtful, you have to challenge yourself, even your own values sometimes, which is not easy. We are used to things, I think, especially in this day and age with television and commercials and mainstream media and Hollywood blockbusters where our minds aren't used to going there, to going that deep, going into even our subconscious. Making a film like that, you're making it for yourself, but you are respecting the fact that your audience whomever that might be also has a mind, and thinks and has information that they will bring to the film as well. It's an art of ideas. A commonality to most experimental film is it doesn't require the narrative art for the audience to be absorbed. Instead of rejecting it, why don't you ask yourself why?, Why am I feeling this way? Am I just frustrated that it's not being spoon fed to me? I felt that way myself when I first started out. I either was bored with it or pretended to be bored with it, or I was infuriated with it. And then the more I thought about it, the more fun it was to think about it. I did believe very much in underground films. The trouble is people are so used to fine groomed footage where you don't have cuts that jump around at all. You don't have things out of focus, you don't have this bad and that bad, everything is good, everything is clean. It's like living with someone who never has to take a bath. It's hitting different buttons in each person, but it's interaction with the work. If they leave the theater, I didn't understand a damn thing, but they go have a coffee with their friends and somebody over there starts talking about what the meaning is for them, and this person who said they didn't understand anything starts saying "no no no, that's not what it was." In other words, they know something, they just don't realize how much they know. What the hell is this? Must be a cartoon. It must be some symbolism. I think it's symbolic of junk. Uh Oh. It's a cockroach. Is there anything special you are trying to say in these films? Um, no. When Andy Warhol was doing his... making his films, everybody said "oh how easy, in the future everybody will be, you know, doing that." Nobody did that. You cannot repeat Dreyer, you cannot repeat D.W. Griffith, you cannot repeat Hitchcock, and you cannot repeat Andy Warhol. If you are bored, or if you are frustrated. That's a part of the original entry into the film, that the filmmaker who is a normal human being, or more or less normal human being than the rest of us knows what a normal movie does, and so he knows that I'll go through a process of getting used to this experience. To see this film, be it Michael Snow, when the reality begins to move, or Andy Warhol or Brakhage, one just has to permit that reality that is on the screen to work on you through your eyes, to work on your body on your mind, and one has to be totally relaxed and open. The Avant-Garde, I think, really gets started in the twenties with the surrealists. The Surrealists were intent on tapping the unconscious. They realized that the process of putting together images that don't necessarily have a linear connection is very much like the process of what Freud described as the dream work. These were not people who said well we tell stories, like people have always told stories. There just was this vibrant, vibrant culture. What can movies say? Cornell was a nut job. Cornell was my hope to earn a salary. He would talk to me, the young kid, and go into his various complaints, of how this one snubbed and that one, you know. Do you like Rose Hobard? Great. It was so disruptive, you know, following something, and it would change. I was interested in disruption, but this was beyond anything I had done. Good God, you know that was really a learning. As I understand that the audience's were few, almost no one at the beginning. Apparently they had trouble even getting through the screenings. The audiences were mostly polite, but occasionally people would stick their hand in front of the screen, or indicate some other kind of reaction. They were different. Each one was different from each other, but most of them had an extreme personal intensity, an oppositional relationship to mainstream culture, as well as an awareness of the history of art and of film. They were however, deeply personally engaged with a quest, a quest that is recorded in their films, and of which their filmmaking was a part. She was enormously important because at the time that Maya Deren had decided that she was going to begin to make films, in 1942, the idea that you could pick up a camera and not go through financing, and through a studio, and you could just pick up a camera and make a movie. That wasn't really part of American culture. Maya Deren got the first Guggenheim ever given for film. She convinced the Guggenheim foundation that film was an art form, but much more than the films themselves, were the ideas behind them, and just her enormous skill at getting people interested in this work. She was this great organizer and proselytizer. I think Jonas learned a lot of those skills from Maya Deren. We were brought together because we had a central interest, cinema, but people had very different ideas, and how to tolerate each other. It wasn't a tight club. We were showing films, and people were paying to come in, and there was an audience and Jonas was just doing this- pushing, pushing, pushing, and it was the right thing to do. Jonas Mekas was in charge, and he was the most exciting person. I mean he just got excited about anything. He got excited about just leader, and so I decided well if he could get exited about leader, I'd just do leader. And so I just did a lot of leader, and it was exciting. Jonas set up these screenings, and what was called the New American Cinema, and still is, happened because it was so open. So you got busted yourself? Jonas came down and made sure he got arrested too. We were young. It was a place of refuge for people who did not feel that they wanted to be or could be in any way mainstream. I even became enough of a... can I say a Jonas Mekasian to believe that one could overtake commercial Hollywood underground films, so Maidstone was serious, but I must say it flopped. I could have bought a yacht, opened a petcocks and sunk it, and I'd been no worse off. I have been working for a living ever since, but happily because making that movie was a fantastic experience. Pick up the camera and go out and do it yourself is a democratic cinema, and it's, way beyond anything imagined could happen then. When you start hooking images together, the mind starts going, the heart starts going, and people are struggling to create a kind of narrative. With sounds and pictures you can conjure anything, anything. It's a fascination with the phenomenon of film. The film itself, what is this thing? Look at this cut, look at this frame, look at this stuff that makes up the image. And why do you think people connect with this film so much over the years? I think you're speaking of a very small number of people, you know. It's not playing at the IMAX, whatever. Jonas came in basically as a documentarian. As he became involved with the early American avant-garde, he began to shift, and he began using this camera, still something like making documentaries, except they were personal documentaries. And I think what distinguishes Jonas from everyone else in that period of new American cinema was a great humanist. I very often don't know why I'm filming. I walk with my camera and suddenly I want to film something, and it has very little meaning but at that moment when I'm filming, but I have to film it. All the women of my village that I remember from my childhood, they always reminded me of the birds had autumn birds, as they fly over their fields. The dominant form of my cinema became the diary form. Which I began already keeping a film diary, immediately after I came to this country in 1949, Since I have so little time, being split between so many passions and interests, the diary form, you can do whenever you have time, just that day, shoot a little bit and maybe... You didn't bring your camera to this? I have my camera. My Bolex. I have it always with me. There are filmmakers practicing, working usually short forms of cinema that produce films very personal, that do not deal with any spectacular subject in any spectacular way. That form, those filmmakers like Marie Menken's work, is not very well known. Those images that maybe tell, are important to her, whatever is close to her, and has a meaning to her, very often has meaning to us. I am not interested in spectacular, in unusual, in sensational. I only interested in the most daily, the most simple activities and feelings. One thing maybe to some viewers is not easy to take, what's known as single frame activity. We record that reality so that it would reflect your feelings, your state of being in that moment then we are watching that reality. You break it down into individual frames and then introduce a different rhythm into it during the moment of shooting. Maybe it is a concentrate, like orange concentrate, that you can then have a glass of water and make orange juice for yourself. You mentioned there is some deep meaning always underneath the reason why you chose to film something. Yes, because I walk with my Bolex, and now with my Sony, and now suddenly there is something happening there and I want to film. I don't film, I mean I won't, I live 24 hours a day, but I film only brief moments, maybe during that one day or sometimes that one week. Why do I film it? Maybe there is a color, maybe there is some movement that provokes a memory, again I am always going back to the childhood, and I have to film it, I have to film it. So that the living through the war, living through a DP camp effects it when you are walking down 2nd avenue or 1st avenue? Nothing really disappears completely. It's there and you never know what moment and how and why it really appeared and will affect what you do and how you behave, but it's all determined from one's total past. I come from a farm, I'm a country boy, you know, that's why you see a lot of nature in my films. Even when I'm in the city, filming the city, I manage to find nature even in the city. And then the war. There is the whole 10 years of war, and post war, displaced person camp, forced labor camps. Of course it's there in me, and even if I cannot exactly know how it affects what I do, it affects, it's, it's there. There is no such a thing as abstract film. Every film is real, cinema is real, every frame is real. I've been making films with the family 16mm Cine Kodak camera since I was 8 years old, and so I made what I called apprentice works, working up to Fireworks. The film was very much like a dream I'd had, and I think it's a pretty close transcription of the dream. I had only one seeming objection. A woman from India said I should be burned at the stake. So, I don't know why, but that was her opinion. Here's everybody's favorite shot. Well, it's a very simple prop. It's a roman candle, and it didn't backfire, luckily. I met this group of bikers. They weren't like the Hell's Angels, they were just a bunch of working class, Italian-Americans who loved to make their own bikes. I asked if I could make a film about them, they said "sure." Are you surprised at looking back at your career how important this film has become? I don't know. The word career bothers me because that suggests making money. I've never made money. I'm definitely not a commercial artist, and then there is a big contrast between my approach and, say, Warhol. The money came later on from my Hollywood Babylon books, but it isn't all that much money. Who made that jacket? I made it myself. I took it back to Los Angeles, and a package was left on my doorstep in a film can, and I thought it was one of my things coming back to me, and then I looked at it and it was from a Lutheran Sunday School. But I kept it. I said "this can fit right in." I've never been prosecuted for it. You don't believe the story of it being delivered to my doorstep? It happens to be true. I believe you if you say so. I have a few things in my life which is, I call it serendipity or maybe a little bit of magic, and in Scorpio Rising it's the sign of Scorpio, which rules machines and sex. Do you feel you're part of the so-called queer cinema at all? Definitely not. I hate the term. It's an insult and kind of trivializing a deep emotion. They're films by Kenneth Anger. I don't need any other label. It's influenced by Aleister Crowley, but not in a didactic way. He believed in the sort of undercurrents of paganism, which are still around, and things like Stonehenge and Egypt were manifestations of it in different ways. And how did Maryanne Faithfull like the movies? She put us all in jeopardy. She kept her heroin in her makeup box as if it was face powder, and I think sometimes she mistook the heroin for the face powder and powdered her face with heroin. Was there much of an influence of drugs, especially in the sixties or seventies, not necessarily in your work but on the work of avant-garde film? I was part of it. Not in an over the top way but, I think it had some influence. It just sort of loosened me up a little bit. One assumes that you're a master, and you're well known and you can just pick up the phone and call someone and they would send over a money order for your next film. Is that true? No, because I don't have a phone. I don't like phones. I don't like television- I have no television set. I never had one, but I do have a business manager sitting behind you, he has a phone. Would you give us an ordinary pan, smooth and so on like that. Now, the eyes can't actually see that way. Anyone can try this in their room if they try to move their eyes steadily across a room to make a pan with vision. It's the impossible. The eyes do actually in fact instead do this. They jump around. If you would make that same pan again and while you make it, use the zoom lense very swiftly and extremely so that you would pick up little bits of objects as you make that pan. Quick cuts. You want to try that? Well it would be cuts and so on, or jerk it back and forth even in that sense, picking up different pieces, bits and fragments and putting it together. If you are watching a TV program like this one for instance, and if you want to see how much sound distracts from your seeing something, go turn the sound off, and when the sounds is turned off then, my experience is and most people I have talked to about it that, seeing increases immediately. I'm threading up Mothlight, which I think is still Brakhage's most rented film. He pasted moth wings and blades of grass and little flowers and so forth onto the filmstrip and then just printed that. It wasn't photographed; it was just a collage that he had printed. And when you watch the film it's like there's a certain kinda feeling of as though you're a moth fluttering around a lamp. It's kind of beautiful. It is not an attempt to create an equivalent of something I have seen. It's an attempt to enter a world wherein I cannot see. The place where almost all of us start when we talk about Brakhage is his theory of baby vision. His idea that at the moment of birth- this child comes out of the dark womb, and is overwhelmed with light, and in time color and movement. We've just come out of a kind of sensory deprivation chamber. This is a very different audience experience. He made films because he had to out of personal necessity, and he wasn't trying to force the audience to do anything. I think his hope was to energize each viewer's eyesight, to cause each viewer to see something in a new way. Later he began painting on film so one could say "This are is no more real, not film reality." But the paint that he's using, the inks, it's all real and it affects the eye, it affects the eye, affects us very deeply. Each great film creates it's own language, and you need to learn that language. Try to notice it on a visual level. Notice color and rhythm and texture and all of the cinematic qualities that are there. He's making films that are evoking himself, and I just think it shows how clear his vision was, it never faltered. I feel I have been given so much, and then I would like to give something back. Not a picture of a flower but some flower that couldn't exist except on film. He's one of the greats, one of the very very very greatest. When the entertainment value of the vast number of films withers away, we'll be left with the Dreyers, the Brakhages, Tarkofskys. The questions of avant-garde cinema and commercial cinema will hardly matter. I've been called a crazy man, idiot, amateur, sloppy, a technician, a fraud. If you want to know what cinema is, it's Brakhage. I very much started within the world of experimental filmmaking. People like Jonas were, they were a little intimidating, Jonas, P. Adams, the people from the older generation. To me they were historical figures, even though there they were right in the room with me, but they weren't people I would hang out with. These were films that took the questions of form so seriously and so extremely that it really challenged all my assumptions about film as a story-telling device. I wanted a story. I wanted politics. I wanted sex. I wanted beauty. I wanted, you know, adventure. And so... But you didn't go to Hollywood? Right, no, I didn't go to Hollywood because I didn't have the money, and maybe I'm a little different than Hollywood, but so it made me try to figure out, through my films, how I could do both things. I feel like my work lives somewhere between the experimental, the documentary and the essay. Sink or Swim is essentially a film in 26 chapters that tells the story of my relationship with my father, and in another sense, Sink or Swim is a vindication of the rights of children. Every story in the film is true according to me and that's a very important caveat because of course all of us have our own memories, and our own history. The girl's father had a sister whom he loved very much. As children, they lived on a farm in New England, and went swimming during the summer at a neighbor's pool, which was fed by ice cold spring water. His sister usually waited until he finished his chores, but one day she went alone, knowing that he would come by soon after. It was a hot afternoon, but the pool was deserted. She tore off her shoes, dove into the icy water, and died immediately of a heart attack. With something like the essay film, there is an effort being made to look at life, some aspect of life, and maybe not have the images perfectly illustrate what's being said, but somehow have a sense of the camera being used to observe the world and then text to comment on the world. He wrote: "I'm just back from Hokkaido, the northern island. Rich and harried Japanese take the plane, others take the ferry. Waiting immobility, snatches of sleep. Curiously all of that makes me thing of a past or future war. I think films like Marker's have a closer affinity to the world of experimental film than more conventional documentaries like the Maysles or Fredrick Weisman's. And I really admire Maysles and I adore Fredrick Weisman. What somebody like Marker is doing, yes he goes to Japan maybe in the same way that Weisman goes to boot camp, but he then takes that material and starts to play with it and speculates on it. He told me that this city ought to be deciphered like a musical score. One could get lost in the great orchestral masses and accumulation of details. The essay film, it's that which exists in between the speed of the moment where you've captured an image or seen one, and the moment you meditate on it. It has moments where you blank out. You come back because you have a sense that you haven't finished yet with it and the film hasn't yet finished with you. It's the kind of illusion that only great art creates, that you could do it too. It's telling you what it is to think about even images and sound. The desire of all filmmakers always shackled by the idea of their commercial obligation is effectively expressed because what's at the core of the essay film is the absolute freedom of the creator. Another year is passing. In the roaring waters I hear the voices of dead friends. My heart's memory turns to you. David, Howard, Graham, Terry, Paul, David, Howard, Graham. And part of the problem, part of what is so fucked up is that I feel most of life is about performing for people. It's like being the nice teacher, being the good child, being the good parent, being the good lover, being the good neighbor, being the good citizen you know, And probably a lot of like being bad also performance. And my god my god, I'm sick of it. Somebody who is watching a film is going to have to understand what they are looking at and what they are listening to, sometimes at the same time. I just think of the human brain and how it puts things together, and then I hope I do it in a way that makes it work. Now, I'm in business. How's your boy doing? Great. Yeah he's fine. You should have reversed it, you should have been the actor and he should have been the director. No, he's doing good. I used to change his diaper. ¶ It started last weekend at the Yale-Howard game. ¶ Girl I saw your beaver flash, ¶ I'll never be the same. ¶ Oh no. ¶ You gave me a soul kiss, boy it sure was grand, ¶ You gave me a dry hump behind the hot dog stand. Oh yes. It seemed there was something hooked in to whatever was socially going on, and what the movies were. It wasn't really about the movies as much as it was about the society. In the camera? What is this Errol Morris? Why can't I look at you? Friend of mine had a camera and he said: "if you've written something, lets go make the movie." And I said, "how could we do that?" He says "lets find out!" So we went out and made a movie, and had fun and then figured out later how to do it and somehow Jonas wrote about it and boom. He's the one who supported stuff that was a little different. When he left The Voice, I feel that everything sagged. The next one Chafed Elbows opened at the Gate Theater on 2nd Avenue and then got moved to The Bleecker, which was my fantasy to have a film there with Scorpio Rising, and that one lasted a long time- for months and months. What's going on? You gotta draw the line somewhere. And actually Lionel who owned it paid us for our films. You know you got a check every week, I said "Wait a minute, this is too good!" These sort of little independent theaters like The Bleecker Street Theater why, why don't they exist in New York anymore? Well this is it, and I know what you mean, it's sad. We're at a period of disjunct, you know I think people are watching plates of familiar ideas shift apart, and I think they are more open to this kind of entertainment than maybe they were two years ago. So you think this is entertainment or art? I'm here to be entertained! Are you the Virgin Mary? Just call me Mary. How would you compare coming here to going to a commercial cinema? Um, there's no popcorn. This box is the target of 46 billion dollars a year in advertising, and if we overload these boxes, they won't remember anything, but if we use creative foreplay before we penetrate, we'll -- Benefit? Looks like? Sounds like? How many syllables Mario? How many syllables Mario? We'll never know. Where were they for 25 years? The closets, ripped up, no negatives, nobody cared, including me. Why do you care? I didn't give a fuck about what I did then you know, I couldn't remember half of it. Pound. Pound is that there were 18 dogs in a pound waiting to be adopted, and if they don't within an hour, they get put to sleep, and actors play these dogs. They had a great time. They showed it here. But this was the first time Bob, that anybody had seen Pound in years. I know. I bought a ten dollar copy on eBay and I figured "what the hell," it's been out of print forever, I can never seen it, so I picked it up and it has the time code on the bottom and everything, but it was good. Uhh, yes yes yes. He knew early on that he could be in a movie because we used to bring him when we made all the movies, and one day he said "I could do that!" and I said "Do what?" He said "Whatever you need." We're living in Texas. One night there's a tornado warning. That tornado scared me so much it made my hair disappear. Have any hair on your balls? Did you feel that being an independent filmmaker makes for better films, obviously you do, but is it worth the pain of trying to raise the money and all that kind of crap? What you have to go through. Yea, I guess it is. I mean I'm happy with these films being brought back and other films that I've done, a couple documentaries and something new I'm working on. I'm ok. I've been to Hollywood, and I've made some horrible movies, and I've been paid, and it's painful. Ten years out there was the most boring time in my life, and I thank god my son showed up and was in them, and I had fun with him because otherwise it would have been really deadly. And that's my kid inside my wife in this film. That's, that's Iron Man in there. No wonder he had a tough time. You know these interviews with Hollywood directors where they declare that they have absolute freedom, and this is always the greatest amusement for me because they have no freedom whatsoever, but they feel fine. I didn't feel fine and it cost me my social standing and my existence for many years, which I then still only could rebuild when I came to America and here started to teach and also found the public which liked my films and I will never forget that. Good Evening everybody. My name is Steve Anker and it's a pleasure to welcome you here to the Roy and Edna Disney/Cal Arts Theater. The teachings and films of Peter Kubelka were not only a revelation, they were key aspects of what became part of the way we saw the world. All of his films total seven in number and all together well under two hours, but it's a body of film which I think will not only endure but will continue influencing filmmakers and lovers of art, you know, into the distant future. Cinema, I think, taught me how human thinking functions. There was a bird settled on a very thin branch. The branch was in the wind and the bird come down, and as he touched the branch - boo buh buh buh bum - was this noise. And it was fantastic. Buh buh buh bum. And I turned around and behind me was a car repair shop. They had lifted a wrecked car and dropped it. And it had arrived just at the moment when the bird arrived on the thing. So here is my teacher, and I came home, told this my mother and said, My mother said "yes, yes ok." In film, sync is not mandatory. It's artificial. You may do it but you don't have to. Now if I do it, what have I achieved? Nothing. I was chosen to accompany a kinda prestige safari of business people, and that they wanted somebody to make a travelogue. I agreed to do this because I wanted so dearly to go to Africa. We came home, then I worked for five years on this film. Now comes the person who is not content with the status quo of life. Who wants to say: "I am of the opinion that life should not be like this, it should be like that." So how do I do this? I have to communicate this to you. I wanted to have material where you see a human animal before he acts, or she acts, and when the acting takes place, this divide between being truthful, normal and then acting. Every one of you, at this point in time is acting also. We all carry a composure, which we have to have in order to be able to participate here. That started to fascinate me, and then the fact that these elements repeat, that they demonstrate that practically every movement we do, every action, every occurrence is in cycles. And in this film, I saw that I don't have to do anything. The directors of the commercial films have already created these elements that repeat themselves. We can not really see reality. What we think, of what we are conscious is what we learn from our cultures. This film is made, I thought, for people in one hundred years, two hundred years, which will be my triumph because digital will be gone, but the film will still be there. Despite our nostalgia for it, it's about learning this other medium, which is also really very interesting. I mean, it's not film. But it's... Are you still working in film? I will do film again. I'm just taking a rest. When I came into this cinema, I was thrilled immediately: it's black, a great white screen, and it's an event. This is not an event, it's a piece of furniture with moving things on it. If film goes under, I will go under with it. I do not believe it will go under because it has this hardcore that only film can work and no other medium can touch. We have a hundred years of registering human development, evolution on a medium which mankind will not be able to afford to lose, so this is why I think even if it dies now, it will have to be reawakened and it will be. This is where I spend most of my time with my friends around table. It is where we all work. Robert, Robert Haller. Our beautiful cat. These are my two Bolexes: like ten years, ten years. I am now on my fifth Bolex. Fifteen years ago I realized that I'm stuck, I'm beginning to repeat myself, to imitate myself. So I said it's time to switch to video, different technology because different technology means different content, different form, different style. Now we are going into our main film vault. We have total maybe around sixty-five thousand films. Maybe three quarters consists of the films abandoned by the labs that went bankrupt. We brought them here from the dumpsters, from the streets. Here is the library. Not films but paper materials. There are boxes and boxes in the basement with books and periodicals. The first issue of Film Culture came out in 1954. There were many young people who wanted to say something, to discuss cinema, to write about it, to argue, so The Time said "Why don't we start a film magazine?" These are Filmmakers Cooperative Catalogues - Filmmakers Co-Op used to take any film if you just deposited it. That too, remains. No contracts are signed, films are listed alphabetically, filmmakers decide what rental price is, and it works very well. We go into the film archivists. This was supposed to be my office, but there is no space. What are you trying to do with those Cornell's? Well. There's a hundred and seventy-one of those films, so we're about to start with number one. This is number one-seventy-one as a matter of fact, the last one, so I guess we'll work backwards. That would be a Cornell way to do it. We could roll it backwards. How are you able to make such a strong body of work, and at the same time write, do all of this, keep all of this going? One of the reasons why I can continue is that I take it easy. I survive on wine, women and song, plus cinema. Why are we here? We are here to see our film. We are one of the 48 Hour people. Do you know who Jonas is? I don't. Do you know where you are? No. Do you know what they do here? They show movies that probably wouldn't get shown other places. And why is that? Uhh, Because I guess they wouldn't make money. There isn't so much audience for what some people regard as extremely obscene work or challenging work. Do you know anything about the Anthology Film Archives? Uhh, very little. Do you know who Jonas Mekas is? No. Stan Brakhage? No. Stan Brakhage was um, a video artist, I think, who has gotten popular only since his death in a way and otherwise was restricted more to film school kids. Um. I do sound. We made a film in the 48 Hour Film. Did you know Jim Jarmusch did sound? No, I do not. Do you know who Jim Jarmusch is? Do you know who Jim Jarmusch is? Do not. Do you know who Federico Fellini is? Do you know who Stan Brakhage is? I will. Okay do you know who Jonas Mekas is? I will. Okay. Promise? It's not that easy to be just like that. It's not easy. I'm trying. I hope someday I will achieve that state. Just be. Just be like Mitch. Yes. This is Jonas Mekas. He's an avant-garde filmmaker and what you see here is one of the individual frames when you see a film reel. He has taken one of those little teeny, tiny frames and they have blown it up. The collector could actually buy the whole forty images framed and it's like a masterpiece. That cost like five thousand dollars each per... each still. Oh I love these. The images are fantastic. Even the slanted sidewalk. The only venue that I think comes close, so far, to what Anthology and Jonas have done is YouTube, and that's even virtual you know. It's the only place where people exchange ideas and visual creativity. It's got a show all of its own. A big show, in a gallery. I mean that wouldn't be possible even ten years ago. It's a beautiful transition for the modern art lovers to come in and see because these filmmakers were, they're like paintings that move. It's like a poem, it's like a haiku. It's just a small and visible appreciative little poem. It's something you don't usually see. The meaning is open to interpretation. This is some of the sensation too with the movement. We were supposed to have a presentation by Martin Scorsese, but Marty's in the midst of a post production job. This is what Martin wanted to be said tonight. Anthology film archives is forty years old this year. A milestone for it and the man that founded it, and who has tenaciously worked to nurture it, Jonas Mekas. Now that the very concept of an author who is increasingly under siege, I have to thank him for teaching me, that is Marty, and teaching me how to see. And I'll second that. Jonas. He's on fire, and sometimes he's really off. His taste could be terrible, but the overall thing is concern and care for something. We're not talking about nostalgia. We're not talking about going though the past. We're talking about going to the future with a sophistication that understands this. We only sold three of these four- monitor installation. How much does it cost? Like hundred thousand dollars, and I think those are pretty cheap compared to like Bill Viola who gets like one million dollars for one of those installations which are nonsense. This is a way for artists to make some money and to continue working because otherwise how would the artists ever make money from this. It's too complicated to talk about that subject here. But we have said goodbye to it. It's a constant struggle to get money. We are supported by our patrons, the tickets that people buy to see films, by those who rent the theater, and by small donations from here and there. Anthology is a non-profit corporation. Part of keeping it going has to do with addressing all the attendant responsibilities of running that kind of an institution. Some cathedrals take centuries to be built. We still have to build a library on top. It will be on top or we have a space behind. It will be built, it will be done. ¶ I have to sleep. ¶ I have to sleep. ¶ And I can't sleep. ¶ It's like music like this. ¶ I can not sleep. ¶ It's 2:30 in the morning. So what are you shooting now? You. But why? Ha, ha, ha, because, actually no reason. ...til there is anything left. Do you think somebody your age cares about like Jonas' films and that kind of avant-garde film? Probably more my generation than the one before. Why? Just cause he, uh, It's just a very selfish, superficial planet and I think that there's something, you know there's like a grain of something pure in the world that he has created, and people move towards that when they're not affected yet by society or they wanted to be free. I think we were actually, we were all inspired by that work. It showed us what was possible. That there were different ways of thinking, different ways of dreaming, different ways of making work, different ways of using the camera, or not even using the camera, and you could make film, and it was low tech, and it was close to the bone, and you were individual. I guess to be alone, is to know yourself for you, and not who you are with, and I like that. All my work that I have done was trying to get back to the state and see life and reality as real when I was like four or five years old. It was all there already, and later, you know, some of us managed to retain, and others they become old at thirty-three and they just, you know, and the rest is not important. I have no idea where I am, and I don't care. Jonas was at the root of all this, these filmmakers of whom everyone is so to speak, a planet in himself, that they did together something. Jonas sort of formed the entirety as a movement. I followed Jonas' traveling cinematheque for twelve years until it became the Anthology Film Archives. I felt all through those years where I would see these amazing movies and think what will happen to them? And although I had certain quarrels about Anthology when it began, the Anthology has done amazing work, and it's particularly done amazing work in its preservation of a kind of film that no one else would have preserved without the Anthology being there and Jonas being behind it. He is probably one of the purest people I have ever known, in that what he's been true to he's been true to. It's never varied. Whatever inner storms of doubt he had I never saw them. He loves the underground film, he felt that was the way of life, and he's probably the greatest champion of it we've had in America. I don't think that they are fighting an uphill battle any more than artists in any other traditional mediums have fought uphill battles. We're used to film being a consumable kind of material and experience, and we don't expect the kind of depth and longevity with film that we've come to understand the other mediums. For a great poet or a great painter's work to enter the culture, more often it takes generations for the work to be fully appreciated. I don't do anything unless I feel I really have to do it, because nobody else will do it. Filmmakers Cooperative was absolute necessity. We started Film Culture because it was absolute necessity, nobody else will do it, and have to, we needed it, and to start a cinematheque was the same. When I got this building for Anthology was the same, absolute necessity to have our home so that nobody can dictate us, and we need a huge space, and down the line. So that's how my life goes. And is it absolute necessity to create art also? Yes. Yes it's absolute necessity. Absolute necessity. Also to be with friends. Friends and love. These are absolute qualities and necessities.
