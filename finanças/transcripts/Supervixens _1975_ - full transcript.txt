Martin Borman, Superservice. - Give me Clint, please. Good morning Super Angels. How are you? Don't shit! I need Clint. Is he busy? No, no, he's not too busy. I'll call him, wait. Don't all day! It needs to be lubricated. - What do you have? I recommend 10-40. - Sounds like a good number. Clint the phone! I'll take this. Clint! - Honey, we're out of cat food. So go buy. - I'm not dressed. And besides, I'm a lonely Clint. Ho e li ku i? Klinte! Clint! - No way, honey, it's just Martin and me. Sna i e it is. I know it's not easy for you to understand but I'm paid to work here. Besides, I'm busy. So I don't matter to you? Do you have any paper handsome? - Who is that? Wait, I need to give something to the customer. - Clint! Clint? Who the hell is that? Here, 'watt! Clint! Clint, answer me! The customer needed angel paper. - Who the fuck was that? Just some fish. - You son of a bitch! She has a fat ass and no tits! - Shit! He looks like a boy to you. Well, that's better. Much better. Come home stallions in a big bed, Super Angel has a great need. Hey! Can you give me some time? I have to break the angels, Martin can't do everything alone. Hi. Damn you! Super service by Martin Borman. - Who the hell is that? Super Lorna. - Get off the line, bitch! Welcome to Clintom Remzijem! Damn it! You are the one who serves! I can't wait to enlarge your wonderful Man. Where is the toilet? - There. Can we trade? Credit or cash? Martin Borman, Super Servis. Listen to me, fat guy! Pull your fat ass from there and tell my man to come home now or I'll burn this fucking waste! No exceptions? Ne�to dobije�, ne�to gubi�. Let me give you an ultimatum from the Führer: Or ass home nel or you won't have a house to come to! That evil bitch! Okay! What does that shit mean to you to embarrass me in front of the boss? Call the phone and say you're going to burn down the house? Hell! Hell, what about you? What else do you know but spend so much time on your back in a brothel? If you call me from work one more time, I'll kick your ass! Go back to that photographer and abuse him shitty. Angela, that whining is over. Can you hear me I'm tired! You have to swallow men, handsome and muscular in particular, to take them out and spit them out ... Always asking for something, wasting my heart and bread, play those shitty games of mine with me. Angela, first and foremost: fuck everyone else. Give them what they want, when they want and how much they want. Take the money! Shitty crowd because you're an angel. Forget where you came from ... Play the angel to some naive jerk. I'm just serving to turn you on, right? Well, I'm going to blow up this chicken coop and I'm going to ... Was it good? - Yes, but... I mean that fish you fucked in your poor truck! No other fish. Admit you bastard. Your fat boss always covers you. That's why you can't come with me! I'm tired of your accusations. Your ass isn't worth it. You! - Let me ... - Damn you! What do you want, bitch? - Don't touch my ass shit! I gave you my body, the most beautiful you will ever have and you don't even appreciate it! And what do you have? You're just like your mother whore! Klinte! All right, enough of Angela! Za epi ru na master! Just say something else about my mother and they'll break your damn jaw! Super Angel, you yelled at me for the last time. Go fuck the whole regiment, it hurts more! Ti ku kin sine! Fuck you shit! Who are you to threaten me? Hey! Ku ko! I'll break your ass! Your damn car! - Angel! If you want to be my lover, you need a better one! You are blind! No fucking class! No class! - What about you? Son of a bitch! - Stop it, damn it! That's my truck! Crazy bitch! I wanted a Cadillac! Even Lincoln! Let me bastard! What are you doing? Give me the ax! - I won't, you cheap mar! Fuck the truck ... - Give it to me! Let me go! - Give me the damn ax! Let go! You drunken bastard! Let me go, you jerk! - You'll see now! Come here! Let me go, you're hurting me! Clint, let me go! Yes sir, 1825 la Mesa. Come on! - Let me go! He's trying to kill her, hurry up! Come here! - Let me go! Come on, you fool! - Let me go, Clint! Let me go! Sir! Sir, this one is trying to kill his wife! He's trying to kill a woman, sir! What do you want? Come on! - Help! Help! Fuck you, the police are coming! Spasila ka kola 4, 1012, Las Palmas. Is she hurt a lot, sir? We'll call you if you need to. Get your ass out of here! I just want to help. - I said, get out of here! You better learn to control that nature a little, boy. Damn, you could kill someone like that. Your lady is on her way to the hospital. What happens to you depends on what she has to say. And you better hope it's something good or you're in trouble. Do you understand? I've seen you before. You work for Martin Borman, don't you? Well, damn me. Well, let's see what we do with you. Let's give you a chance. Go back to work and let your lady calm down a little. Let it cool. We'll be in a relationship. Hey, deco ... Don't try to run away from me. Because if you do that, I'm going to have to hurt you! And now get the fuck out of here! Come on! Do you feel like a doctor? It's nothing broken, young lady, just stay in bed for a few days and drink lots of hot chicken soup. I haven't seen better in a long time. Dr. Fervic, report to your office. Hi, I'm a Harry Sled traffic cop! I want to throw that bad son of a bitch in jail. He beat me for the last time. I don't want to contradict you, Mrs. Ramsey but I saw your Man. It was as if he had been scratched by a wild cat. I'm not Mrs. Ramsey. I'm Angela. Angela Turner. Thanks for telling me that asshole. Ma ne mora da mi zahvaljuje . I always help young ladies in need. Especially to such beautiful ladies. - Can I return the favor? Why not take a break? Go home and wash up. Your shift is over. Thanks Martin, I could. I wonder: Is that fucking worth that fuck? Get out of here, you bastard! You fucking woman! Asshole! Do you have a feeling my man won't come back? Certainly not today. Do you want to drink Harry? - No thanks, I'll enjoy a cigar. I like a good cigar but not always in my mouth. Do you want to play? - No, I never knew. Would you mind if I did? - Hell, no. Who bored you, Clint? Just pour Ha i. Pour and nothing more. To you fine men, beautiful things always slip away. Don't play, don't drink ... you must be dangerous in bed! Try me and you'll find out. Give me a minute Harry, I always like a warm bath first. Don't drink so hot, it will slow you down. Nobody tells me to stop drinking! I'll be done in two hours. I would say... I'd say Angelina's tits are bigger than yours. Harry, are you ready? - I am not. I have to listen to the doctor. He didn't tell you that! Harry, I never disappoint anyone. I don't like it at all! We'll do it my way or we won't at all! - But he has so much to offer ... It just needs a little help. Damn, I told you it didn't work for me! Doesn't work? What the hell is wrong? What the hell is wrong with you? Aren't you ready ?! With a body like this, you need balls to tell me you're not ready! All those muscles mean nothing to you! Get out of my bed, you moron! You may not have heard me well, pig: get your ass out of my bed! Well, that's how it goes, honey: Sometimes it rises, sometimes it falls. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow?! Tomorrow, my ass! How do you know you're going to get up tomorrow, you lazy fagot! Tomorrow?! Shit! Besides, the man is coming to me tomorrow. I know where to find him. A beautiful stallion to exchange for you? Jesus, what a joke! Bri�i drkad�ijo! Or I'll call the police. Funny, isn't it? To call pigs for pigs. It doesn't get you to be sexy but because you have the worst mouth I've ever seen. You threatened me, didn't you? I'll go when I'm damn ready. What's more, I think I'll stay for a drink. You bastard! Your phone doesn't work. - Bastard! He hit me! He desecrated my body. Ha ... ubi u te! Isn't that fist in your stomach enough? I'm going to break your ass now! All right, come on, hit me! Why are you so crazy? Come on, hit me! All right, come on! What does that mean? Maybe tits? Come on, hurt me! Hit me bitch! You're all wrapped up. Come on, slut! Make a little effort! Patience betrays me. Now get your ass in the bedroom and wait to see what comes next. An�ele. Super An�ele! Come on, baby, open the door. Get out, get out, you freak is moving! I won't hurt you. I'm ready now. I'll call the police, I swear! I'll call the police! Come on, pull yourself together. Get out! Get out, get out! Or I'll call the police! I want to order! I'll call the police! You have all the police you need, girl. Now you better open the damn door or I'll break it down! I said, open the fucking door! What was Harry's traffic? Did your other muscles limp too? It doesn't matter, I always trust old Rufus from the neighborhood that he would call the police. You need to know pig! Super clumsy pig! You better give up Harry, I tried it once myself. And you wouldn't make it, even if you could! I'm glad my man doesn't have such problems. Because what do they say about young skinny guys: everyone is gifted and that is true. And not like you. Is that how you score your big night beating Harry? That's probably the closest thing to it! Maybe you used to be good, maybe you got old and dirty he shrugged somehow. I call you a fagot but you're not good even for that. The fagots are at least doing something with him. Stari sme urani Hari! Old, wrinkled dick Harry! You'll regret being born when my uncle falls. I'm going to have to hurt you now! Misli da si faca, a? I'll cut you like a fucking chicken! Sorry cunt. Fucking bitch! You're a fucking bitch now! Shit! And that is the end of our music program on channel 98. We now move on to the KPCK, which knows what community responsibility is. We are reporting live from the UN session where Sir Baged-Height of Great Britain talked about how inevitable it is in South Africa ... How the fuck, huh? How about I turn you on a little too? Po�ar! Po�ar! Come on, Clint. Hey, come on. What did you do? Why? - What did I do? Don't give me that chaise, you know what I'm talking about! Why didn't you refrain? Jesus! Okay, a little bit to beat her, but to burn her? To burn who? Angela ... she's dead. �ta? Is Angela dead? Who did that? - No shit! I've been here for hours. I've been here for hours! Look, I can prove it. - I hope. Hey Ha i! Haji will tell you I've been here all night. Is that so, honey? La�e� de�ko! He came a few minutes before you. La�ljiva ku�ko! You're just a piranha! - Hey, you're crazy. Asshole! La�e do�avola, �to... Okay, now I know the truth. - Well let go, let go! Martine enska la e. She was angry that I fired her tonight. Believe in whatever you want. Well, someone killed her and you're the most suspicious. You have to leave town tonight. Here's $ 130, that's all I have. I'll send you more when you call me. And now nel, it won't be easy. Good luck! Sobbing. Thanks buddy. Where are you going? - To the west. - Get in. I'm going to Santa Paz, out of state. I'm turning here. - I appreciate this. - Don't mention it. Stop! Pick it up! Gde ide ovek? - Na zapad. Uska�i! Did we save your day? - Yes, I appreciate it! I'm Cal McKinney. This is my wife, Super Cherry. Clint Ramsey. I'm glad. Like I said, my body is very tense today. Dynamite baby, dynamite! I reach the climax easily. I came in the shower this morning. Yes, I came without even touching. Only... hot water ran down my body. Can you do better than that, Clint? I love masturbation. I mean, apart from practicing, it really turns me on. Like touching under my left breast, I squeeze it a little and I get chills. I just touch it and it's really nice. Like now. Here, touch! Nisi jo ni po eo ove e! Tell me, are you hot, Mr. Ramsey? I appreciate the hospitality ... the ride, I mean ... But Miss ... - Cherry. Super Cherry. G�ice Super Vi�nja... Can you calm down a little? - Hey! You reject my soul just like that? Oh, it's not just that. Probably not ready ... I could get closer to him like this. He seems to have suffered a lot. - Okay, stop now! Wait, I have to get out. Okay? Thanks for the ride. Will you just let him go? - You know me, honey. Hey, Clint, bro, that's not how Super Cherry is treated. I didn't mean to offend her. - But you should have respected her! Like this, get back in the car and leave me alone. That. Yes, I'll leave you alone ... Ubieu too! I'll kill you! Half is mine! Kale! Kale! - Oh, I'm bitten by a snake! Suck it! Suck, suck! - I can not! Come on! Come on! Oh, can't you help? Damn you! You! Take me to the doctor! Hurry up! Poku vam da po urim! I don't know how to drive! - Why don't the snake bite you in the ass! Are you a good boy? - Yes, great. That's great. Yeah, looks like I'm okay. Ku kin sine! Come on! You will not easily find a ride on this road. Looks like you ran into a fucked up customer. Judging by your appearance. - There were two of them. My farm is 130km. This is the end of the desert. There is nothing in between. I was in Brovley for groceries. Where are you going? To the west. Why not lie down and relax? You'll enjoy your vacation. My wife is Austrian. One of those commissioned youths. U i da upozna Du ku. I gave it that name because Austrian is difficult to pronounce and ... it suits her well. Sit down, boy. Make yourself at home. Looks like Du ka is peeping! Yes, I see it coming! Yes sir! Nothing better than a woman in the house. Du�ka... This is a young man in trouble, his name is Clint Ramsey. Two villains jumped on him, robbed him and left him in a cruel desert. Du ka, you have to speak English in front of our young guest. Get him in the wound. You and your husband have a nice farm here. Yes, it's nice here but sometimes I feel very lonely. Your husband is a good man. I don't know what I would have if he hadn't come across it. - You're very handsome. Pali� �ene. And my wife, have you patched him up more? What a woman, isn't it, Mr. Ramsey? And only when you try her cakes! These European women really know how to satisfy a man! What are you doing here? - Good evening. What are you doing here? So, my husband needs to rest. Wait, I can't take it, you were nice to me. That was our deal. Take it and let's get this over with. Well, I'm going sir. Vide u pre te no to ode . Before you fog, can you take some hay to the barn? - Of course. I have to dig some holes for the pillars. Oh good morning. Milking a cow, right?

Your husband! Your husband! Not! Do you want ... Don't do that. Do you want ... I can't breathe! I'm coming! - Stop it, get up here. I'm cumming, I'm cumming! That! That! Shit! Ho e li ... ho e li ... - Klinte! Clint, can you help me with a chat? Is this how you give it back to me? I gave your ungrateful ass comfort and shelter, healed your wounds, fed you, gave you a roof over your head and a clean bed ... he gave you money and you give me back by fucking my Austrian wife!

Will you speak to the young man? - Yes, sir, I want a one-bedroom. That would be $ 10, in advance. And dinner is at ten o'clock. Okay, uze u. This youth today! My daughter Jula. She is deaf and dumb. She has been like that since birth. When her mother died she was only five years old. I had to raise her alone. It's not easy these days. There are a lot of challenges. He is still a child. And let me tell you something, son: If she just loses a hair on her head, just one hair ... It will work! I didn't raise her just so that some Ćiljokuran would take advantage of her handicap! Well, I don't blame you sir ... Here's your $ 10. Thanks. Watch the office, I'm going to the Rotary Club ... ... and leave that young Devil of the week alone! Then don't belittle everything I wear!
