Whoa. Morning, sir. Can you tell me what the next town is? Aberdeen. Aberdeen? Not Scotland, Illinois. Scots settled it, that's how come it got the name. There's two miles over that rise there. Pretty big town, now. Big enough to have a good doctor? I hope to tell you. Man or animal, Doc Davis is the best. Got his office right across the street from the barber shop, can't miss it. Thank you, sir. Just a minute, that bridle. If my eyes are as sharp as I think they are, you're a Southerner. That's right. Well now, ain't that funny? Here I am headed south, and here you are headed north. That evens things up. Well I hear you're going in the wrong direction, mister. I hear there's a lot of money to be made down there. I don't know anything about scavenging. Scavenging? You're pretty huffy for a grayback, ain't ya? The war's over, mister. Here we are. Come on, David. Sit, Lance. Wait here, Lance. Come in. Dr. Davis? Yes, friend. Something I can do for thee? Well, I don't know. Then what is it you want from me? You both look good and healthy. I'd like you to examine my boy. He's a fine looking lad. What's thy name, son? David, David Chandler. Thee tell me, son. Doctor, he can't talk. Oh. Would thee mind if I had a look at thee, son? Oh, don't like doctors, I take it? Hmm? I'm not the first he's been to, I can see that. Well, I suppose he's tired of having a lot of snoopy old men looking down thy throat, eh? Come on, I'm not going to hurt thee. Come along, now. That's a good lad. Now open thy mouth. No, wider son, wider. Eh, that's better. How long has he been this way? A year. How did it happen? He had a shock. Wait outside, son. What did the other doctors say? What do you say, Doctor? Can you help him? This isn't as simple as a broken arm or a broken leg. This is different. Come to the point, Doctor. The point is, that this is something none of us know much about. Some doctors claim it isn't in the throat at all, but up here. Mr. Chandler, sometimes I wish I were a minister instead of a doctor. A minister could give thee hope. A doctor can only give thee facts. You mean it's hopeless. No, no, no, there's always hope. And faith, does thee have faith, Mr. Chandler? Some. They need a lot of it, or they grow awfully bitter. And bitterness can become a bad habit. Same as war. Now of course, there's an outside chance that he can be helped. Have any of the other doctors suggested any kind of treatment? No. An operation might help, an operation by the right man. By you, Doctor? No, no, no, I wouldn't try that kind of surgery. I was thinking of an old colleague of mine. You think he can? Maybe. But it's no use thinking about it. He's in Minnesota with a Dr. Mayo. Whereabouts in Minnesota? Rochester. What's his name? Strauss, Dr. Eli Strauss. Strauss, Strauss. Wait, hold on. He's not going off just on my say-so. Wouldn't you? I don't know. But I think thee would. Mr. Chandler, take my advice. Make the best of what thee has. Will you write and tell him I'm coming? Of course. I can see it's no good talking to thee. Thee's a stubborn man. I can't pay you now. But I'd like to know what I owe. Is money the only way to pay for something? The gates of heaven will open wide to a poor man. I'll have no trouble getting in. - Thank you, Doctor. - Don't thank me now. Thee may want to damn me after thee gets there. Gotta go to Minnesota, David. There's a doctor there. I know how you feel, son, but we gotta keep trying. He may be the one we're looking for. I knew you'd understand. Come on. Come on, Lance. Hey Harry, them sheep are blockin' the way. Get them moving, Lance. Go get 'em boy. That's what I mean by sheepdog, Pop. Come on, guys. Come on, Lance. Down, boy. Be with you in a minute. No candy this time, David. We'll need food, good food. I know. Thank you Mrs. Schumacher. Good day sir, what can I do for you? My boy and I were just passing through. I need a few things. I could judge that. Can you judge silver? Sterling? $30 worth. Not anymore, they ain't. Maybe before the war. A lot of silver coming up north, lately. It's worth more now, but I won't argue with you. What'll it barter for? Oh, say $10 worth. 20? Split the difference with you, how's that? $15 will buy a lot of groceries and a whole case of candy. - That's the best you can do? - The best. I could leave myself a little room for profit. Take out what you need, and we'll total it all up. What's the matter, what happened? Leave that dog alone. We seen the dog runnin' loose in the alley and we figured he's a stray. Well he's not. - Our mistake, I guess. - Shut up, Tom. - Come on, David. - Just a minute. You don't think we were tryin' to steal him, do you? That's strong talk in sheep country. I don't think anything. I just don't want any trouble. You one of them graybacks? Why, sure he is. Look at them Wellington boots. I don't like talkin' to people's backs, I ask you something. Yes? Yes, what do you mean, yes? The name's Burleigh, Jeb Burleigh. All right, Mr. Burleigh, I'm from the south, if that's what you wanna know. Come on, David. Wait a minute. I'd like a little respect. I told you before, I don't like people I'm talkin' to to walk away from me. Look at me. You look at me when I talk to you. I'm lookin', but I don't see anything. Come on, David. - Come on Jeb, let's get out of here. - Not so fast. You just don't go around accusin' people of stealin'. How do I know he's your dog? Maybe you stole him yourself. Whose dog is he, boy? I told you, he was mine. I want the boy to tell me. Whose is he? Talk up, boy. What's the matter with you, can't you talk? Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you all right? Are you all right? What, what is it? What? What is it? My name is David Chandler of Atlanta, Georgia, I cannot speak. I don't expect much from your brother, but I certainly do from you. How many times have I got to-- What do you want me to do, just stand there and let that grayback scum insult me, is Stop your shoutin'. - What do you mean? - Stop it, stop it! Well he started it, Pop. Well maybe he did, and maybe he didn't. Did he hurt ya? Give me a drink. I think he needs one more than you do. What happened here? Gus, looks like the Reb had been pickin' on my boy, you see. Smells drunk, doesn't he? That don't mean he is. We better let the judge figure this one out. You come along, too. Your father? Come on, boy. Let's see what this is all about. Can I help you, Linnett? Come on, up you go. Oh Linnett. You know I've been meaning to come over and have a little talk with you the way I used to with your father. Your sheep were over yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that. See, Linnett, that's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about. I just don't have room enough for my sheep anymore. You know that little dirt farm that you run, you got me all boxed in there. I'm gonna be needin' a lot more space. Excuse me Harry, you're in my way. Now I'd say it's the other way around. Gettup, gettup, now! Are you sobered up enough to testify? I wasn't drinking, Your Honor. All right, we'll drop the drunk charges for now. You say they were stealing your dog, eh? - Yes, sir. - Mm-hm. How about it, Jeb? The Reb here says you was stealin' his dog. He's a liar. If it's the same to you, Your Honor, my name's Chandler. All right, Mr. Chandler. How do you explain the fact that nobody ever saw Tom or Jeb with your dog, and Marshal here says your boy had him all the time. He was mistaken, Your Honor. Are you questioning the Marshal? If he says your boy had the dog, your boy had the dog. Thank you, Your Honor. Fine, now we go on to the next charge, that's assault. Now, did Jeb Burleigh strike the first blow, or did you? Well it's hard to say. I don't see what's so hard about it, it seems simple enough to me. Either Jeb Burleigh struck the first blow or you did. This is simple, a lot of wars begin before the shooting starts. Chandler, did you or did you not attack this man and throw him to the ground. Yes, sir. All right. Any witnesses, Gus? No, sir. All right, you can step down. Stay on your feet, Chandler, and hear the verdict. And the fact that you're a Reb had nothing to do with my decision. The court has weighed your story against another man's, that's all any court in the land can do, and the way things are now, I got to find you guilty of assault and battery and disturbing the peace. 30 days or $30. 30 days, $30. I haven't got $30. All right, then, it's 30 days. Your Honor, I have a boy to look after. That has nothing to do with it. Most everybody I sentence has got children. If you give me a little time, I'll work, I'll do anything, but I can't leave the boy. I'm sorry Chandler, you should've thought about your boy before you started drinkin'. Case closed. - Come on, Reb. - Wait a minute. Now take it easy, friend. Just a minute, Judge Morely. - What is it, Linnett? - I'll pay his fine. - What? - He said he'd work. Well, he can work it out at my place. Well, all right, if that's the way you want it. Yes, sir. All right, Linnett, turn him loose. Linnett, see me in my chambers. You and your boy wait here. Linnett, you're askin' for trouble. Are you threatening me? Yep. It's always sad to see. What? A little boy tryin' to grow up too fast. Hm. Are you sure that you ain't doin' this just to get back at the Burleighs? They gettin' to be big herders around here now, and I don't think that you or nobody else can stop 'em. I don't wanna hold anybody back, but I don't want anybody holding me back either. The Burleighs, or anybody else. I'm just doing this for the boy. If you're so concerned about the boy, why don't you just take him? It wouldn't work. That's what I thought at first, but after watching him, no, you can't separate them. Well, I hope you know what you're doing. I tell you I know people, especially Rebs and drunks. They're troublemakers. He doesn't look like any troublemaker to me. Besides, the boy. All right, all right, all right. Have it your own way. Give me the fine, give me the $30. Judge, I haven't got the money, either. What's that? What's that you say, Linnett? I'm saying I haven't got the money, but I think I might be able to pay you $10 a month when my crop comes in. Do you mean you deliberately lied to me out there in the courtroom? I mean I just couldn't let you separate them. Now I said I'd pay you the money, and I will. Besides, with somebody to help out, the farm'll begin to pay. Oh, that farm of yours. You'd be a durn lot better off if you got rid of the place and moved into town. And do what? Be a clerk or a waitress or an overworked hired girl? No, I'll stay with the farm. Linnett, you're still a mighty handsome woman. And I won't stay young forever. This is no laughin' matter. People are beginning to talk about you. And they ain't gonna quit talkin' until you're respectably married. People. Don't tell me about people. What am I supposed to do? Fly right into the arms of the first man to offer me lawful marriage? Just to please them? Poor Linnett Moore, all alone on that big farm as though it were a crime to live alone, because I'm a woman and not a man. I'm not a man-starved old maid, Judge Morely. Now, about the money. Linnett, you know that before the war, your father and your brother and me were very good friends. You wouldn't be doing what you were doing if they were alive today. You know, I could throw you in jail for this for obstructing justice and taking advantage of my position. But you won't. That's not a nice place for a respectable lady either, is it judge? Linnett, I swear to you, that I have put, oh, what's the use? Go on, get out of here. Get out, get out, get out. And take your Reb with you, and maybe that's the worst punishment I can give both of you. Thank you, Judge Morely. Go on, get out. Ah. Were you drunk? They said I was. I didn't ask them. I wasn't. Bitter at our Yankee justice? Let's say I'm grateful for your Yankee charity. Hm. Whoa. Ho. Well, here it is. You can see it for yourself. Come on, David. Ho boy, ho, ho boy, ho. Ho boy. I don't want to seem to you what I'm not, Chandler. I didn't get you out of jail out of any sentiment or charity. I run a 200 acre farm here, all by myself. I raise mostly barley. I know it doesn't look like much, but it's good land. Good as you find anywhere. It'll take care of you if you take care of it. A farm's hard to keep up with. You take care of one thing and before you know it, two other things need takin' care of. Like that old barn, for instance. My brother and I always meant to tear it down, put up the new one. Even my dad talked about it. But somehow, something more important always seemed to come up. One day, it'll just fall down. Well, as you can see, there's a lot of work to be done 'round here. There's fences to be repaired, livestock to take care of, north field needs plowing, seed beds need sowing. Not an easy way to stay alive, Chandler. I know about farming, ma'am. Well then you know what I mean. Come on, boy, come on. I'll show you your place. I'll finish them up later. Come on, Lance. Hope I didn't scare you, Chandler. I was just tryin' to give you a run down on the place. Don't worry, ma'am, you'll get your money's worth. Hmm. Come on. Well, this is it. It's nothing fancy, but it's got two beds in it. You can put your belongings wherever you want. This dresser used to be mine. Everything just seems to collect dust. I've been meaning to clean up this place. Well, I'll wash the windows tomorrow and hang up some curtains. Oughta take soap and water to everything. Come on, boy, down you go, down you go. Come on over here, David. Let's spread out this blanket for you. Gets cold 'round these parts at night. Your dog can stay here until we get a place fixed up for him outside. Well, that's it, I guess. Yes. What did he say? He wanted to know if this was our home. Well, you must be starved. But before you eat, you can help me finish unharnessing the horses, how's that? - Ma'am? - Yes? The boy wasn't part of the bargain. If there's any work to do, I'll do it. No. I said no, David. Now you go outside and look around. Now that was a lot of fuss about nothing. If that's the way you want it, Chandler, that's all right with me. That's the way, ma'am. Where were you and the boy heading? Minnesota. Any reason? It can wait a month. Look Chandler, you don't have to stay if it's important. We made a bargain, ma'am. Let's both keep it. Proud, eh? Ma'am? Yes? I never thanked you. Mm. He's got a mind of his own. Good boy, David. You were born for farming. I don't know how I ever got along without you. Would you like to take the cows to pasture? Here. He's busy, he feels useful. It's strange, but when you're around him, you never think about his being the way he is. He's happy enough. How's the work coming? Fine, the field should be ready for seeding in a few days. It's hard to make the plow dig in with the ground so dry. It's funny how different a furrow looks when you're sliding it over somebody else's plow. Even if it doesn't belong to you, it's a great satisfaction to have a straight furrow, feels good. You didn't come in to dinner. It's still on the stove. Guess I wasn't hungry. Look Chandler, I know I said there was a lot of work to do, but you don't have to do it all. Well I want to do as much as I can before, before we leave, you know. Of course. Well if you change your mind about eating, you know where to find it. Giddyup! Yee-haw! Friends of yours? Worse, neighbors. I had to fence them off. They'd have run me right off my land if I hadn't. Fence won't stop 'em. Get away, Chandler. Don't be a fool, guns won't stop 'em either. They're not going to get my land. Wait! Let's try without guns. Come on, David, get on your horse. Let's get 'em, Lance. Pick them off, Lance. Hey there, over here! Hoo-ah! Yah! Hey, hey! Hey, ha, ha, ha! Hey look, hey, hey, hey back. Look at that dog. Look at him work. All right, David, let's get back. No, Jeb! What's the matter with you boys? What's the trouble with you, what's the trouble? You didn't do any good down there. - Dog, dog! - Let's get out of here. Good boy, David. Fine work. Get Lance a drink. You can put that away for a while. You didn't have to, Chandler. The Burleighs weren't part of the arrangement. I guess it's my turn to thank you. I tell you, mister, I've seen a lot of dogs in my time, but that's the best show I've ever seen. And I've seen quite a few. Yes, he's a good dog. Dog, he ain't just any old dog, mister. He's a sheepdog. I've been raisin' 'em all my life, and I know one when I see one. What kennel's he from? My own, my boy raised him while I was gone. Well you got a pure bred dog, mister. Who sired him? Lancelot. Oh yes, the Georgia Kennel. Well you and me are gonna talk us a deal, my friend. What'll you take for him? Oh, he's not for sale. Now wait a minute, mister. You don't have to play hard to get with me. I'm talkin' money right on the barrel head. Anything's for sale if the price is right. Well, I'm afraid you're wrong this time, mister. Bates is the name. I buy sheep and I raise dogs. I don't mind tellin' you you've got a champion. Excuse me, but I've got some work to do. I'll give you $150 for him. Close the deal right now, that's more than I paid for Berkshire Queen last year. No thank you. $200. No, the dog is not for sale. Goodbye, Mr. Bates. What's the matter with him? Does he think I was talkin' through my hat? Who is he anyway, Linnett? Name is Chandler, that's all I know about him. - Reb? - Mm-hm. Stubborn, like all the rest of 'em, ain't he? Now I made him a fair deal, more than fair. He's either a rich man or a fool. Oh, he's not rich, Birm. Reb. $200 is a lot of money, Chandler. Two dollars is, if you need it badly enough. I rejoice to hear what you say, however, I rejoice to hear it, but as the sun is beginning to turn toward the afternoon sky had we not better strike the trail again and make forward, that we may get an opportunity of seeing these wonderful sisters. Harry March giving a cheerful assent, the remnants of the meal were soon collected. Then the travelers shouldered their packs, resumed their arms, and quitting the little area of light, they again plunged into the deep shadows of the forest. Well, that's the end of chapter one. We'll read some more tomorrow night. Time for you to go to sleep. Good night, David. Down, down. Shh. You're good with him. You're working pretty late. I kept a stew hot for you, it's still on the stove. Thank you. He's had a wonderful day. He's gonna miss this, and you. I'll miss him. Sit down, Chandler. Ma'am. Yes? I don't mean to seem ungrateful, but it's not good for the boy to get attached to something. It just makes it that much harder for him to leave. Minnesota? - Yes. - Well, he's your boy, and I guess you know what's good for him, but one day, you'll have to grow roots again. We will, when he gets his voice back. You know, you're a strange woman, ma'am. Am I? That's not any woman's idea of a compliment. Well, not strange, exactly, it's just you're so good with kids, that Oh, I don't know. There's something about David. I guess he's just somebody very special. I didn't mean that. Oh? Oh, why haven't I ever married, is that what you're tryin' to say? Sorry, I didn't mean to be personal. Are you beginning to wonder about me too, Chandler? I'll tell you why I never married. Because, well, because the right man never asked me. That answer your question? Yes, and a lot more than I was gonna ask. Chandler, what were you before the war? Oh, nothing, rich man. That's too far back to remember. You don't want to. Sometimes you can't help it. How'd it happen? Hmm? I mean David. I wasn't there when it happened. I wish you'd tell me. We had a big house just outside of Atlanta. They shelled it, was a big fire, his mother was killed, and, well, David saw it, that's how it happened. When I came back, everything was burned to the ground and, well, the Union soldiers had round up all the children and sent them up north. I finally found David in an orphanage in Pennsylvania. Him and Lance. Since then, we've seen a lot of doctors and a lot of country. What was she like, David's mother? Like David. Fair, blue-eyed, good wife, wonderful mother. Everything a man could ever ask for. Not good to remember that either. You'd better eat. There's nothing as unappetizing as cold stew. You're so right, ma'am. Get up, get up, get up! Whoa. Easy on the downstroke, David, the paint will run. Careful now, just a little mistake, and you'll make a B out of it. That's fine. Now the E and you're all done. Hello, Linnett. Hello, Doctor. Awful hot riding under that sun. - Got something cool to drink? - Water or cider? Cider, nothing better than the juice of the apple. Unless it's the juice of the berry. Well friend, I've been wondering when thee'd be coming in to see me. Must be three weeks. I've been working. I read all about thee and Jeb Burleigh. Of course I can't condone thy fighting, but if thy had to give someone a blackened eye, I'm glad it was his. How does thee like working for Linnett? She's been good to us. Ah. Come on in, Doctor. She's a fine gal, that one. I've known her ever since she was that high. About as big as thy boy. How's he doing? - Fine. How's he getting along with Linnett? Fine. Doctor, you didn't come out here just to ask questions. What is it? Chandler, I have something thy may consider good news, but I don't know. I'm always tempted to withhold from thee. Well, what do you mean? Thank thee, Linnett. I mean this letter. In all conscience, I ought to read it to thee, it's from Dr. Strauss. What does it say? "It's been exciting working out here, Reverend." That's what he always called me. "The boy's case interests me enormously. "The symptoms you describe sound like hysterical paralysis. "I have treated six cases just like it, "and I've had good results with three of them. "So you see, there is a 50/50 chance "I might be able to help the boy." Doctor, tell him we'll take the chance. There's more to the letter, Chandler. "However, I plan to leave here on the 30th "for San Francisco. "If your patient gets here before then, "I will be glad to see him. "Tell Mr. Chandler to allow himself "three weeks for traveling time, testing, "and exploratory operation and treatment. "Assure the boy's father that there will be no fee "for my services. "Fraternally, Eli Strauss." Well? Tell him we'll go. - Thee sure thee wants to? - I'm sure. Is the operation dangerous? No, no, no, nothing like that. The operation is very simple. How much do you take it for travel and expenses? It costs $300 for thee and the boy, Chandler. 300. Take a little time to raise that money. Thee doesn't have time, Chandler. Less than a week. That's no week. I never figured on this. As thee know, Chandler, I'm not a man of money, but I'll lend thee $50 if it'll help. It's all I have. Thank you Doctor, but no. Well, I've done my duty. And duty's always painful. But if thee shall change thy mind, Chandler, let me know. Goodbye, Linnett. Goodbye, Doctor. Fine! Most I can offer you fellas is $50. $50. You're not serious? It aint' as easy to sell a horse as you think. Till you sell 'em, you gotta keep 'em and feed 'em, and that takes money. Well, I know your problem, sir, but I paid $200 for the horse and $100 for the saddle. That's had a lot of wear. There's still a lot left in it. I'll give you $75 for the lot. Take it or leave it. Thank you, sir. Reb. Anything on your mind? Whiskey. Excuse me, excuse me. You mind if I speak to you? No, go ahead. Oh, not like this, Chandler. We're never gonna get anywhere, either one of us, if we don't start being civil to each other. Let me buy you a drink, hmm? That's always a good start. It's up to you Chandler, you know, we can be friends or, well? - All right, I'll have the drink. - Good, good. Now first off, I want to apologize for my sons. For that little visit they paid you. They're grown up, they can apologize for themselves. No, no, Tom's not man enough yet. Jeb is a little hard to control, but you know, they're not bad boys, really, you know, a little headstrong, you know the way kids are. Well, hey. Bates. Chandler, you know, I can't really blame you for having hard feelings. Now plus what the kids did. I played you a dirty turn back there in the alley, I admit it. But you can't blame a father for takin' care of his own sons, now can you? You know what I mean, being a father yourself. Yes, I think I do. Now, I worked hard all my life. I started off with 100 head of sheep. Kept getting bigger and bigger. Now I gotta chance to really amount to something. You know, I could add 2,000 head easy. Why don't you? Linnett's got me all boxed in. Got hills on one side, Timber land on the other, and Linnett's on the other. Now what does she want with that rundown farm? She wants it, that's reason enough. Maybe you could talk to her, eh? Might be some money in it for you. Quite a lot of money, say 500. Well what's on your mind? How would you like to come over and work for me. I've got a job. I'm offering you a better one. I'll stay where I am. I don't think I made myself clear, Chandler. I never make empty threats, but I'm telling you that I'll stop at nothin' and nothin'll stop me to get what I want. You haven't drunk yet. I'll buy my own. Sure, sure Chandler. Before you come in, David, don't forget to bring in the cows. No luck? No. Would you like some coffee? No thanks. I wish there was something I could say. I know. Chandler, I'd like to help. I know you're going to misunderstand this, but I could get a loan on the farm. No, thank you anyway. Must be something to do. There is. What? I've got to sell the dog. Oh, no, you can't. I don't want to, I know how much he means to the boy, but there's no other way. Well, there must be another way. Right now, Lance means more to the boy than his voice. Yes right now, what about 10 years from now, 20 years from now? No, you see, I remember him as he was. I remember the last day. My company was riding off, and David came yelling down the road. Johnny, Johnny! That's what his mother used to call me. It's the last thing I ever heard him say. Suppose he never speaks. You've got to be prepared for it. - He'll speak. - I hope so. As much as you do, but you can't sell the dog. Not on a 50/50 chance. You know how I feel about David. I'd give anything to hear him speak, that's why I'm telling you these things. I'm only thinking of what's good for him. I'm thinking of David too, only him. Then why don't you ask him? Because it's not his decision to make, it's mine. Well, then there's nothing more for me to say. Wait, don't go. Not like this. Don't make it any worse. Try to understand. I do understand. No, no you don't. You don't know how it is to go up and down the country to doctor after doctor hearing the same thing, paralyzed, he'll never be able to speak. It's the first time I've been given any hope. I can't quit now. What if it fails? What'll you do then? Start roaming and looking all over again? Just pick up roots whenever you hear of a new doctor who might help? When does it stop? When does it end? When the boy speaks. Well. As you say, he's your boy, and it's your decision to make. When do you want to leave? Any time now. Tomorrow's as good a time as any. The sooner you go, the better. We'll hitch the horses in the morning, and I'll drive you to the depot. Nights get cold in Minnesota. I'll pack some food and an extra blanket for the boy. Thank you. There's nothing to thank me for. You did a good job. Fences are up, fields are plowed, the barn's repaired. I got more than my money's worth, Chandler. Much more. Whoa. Light it. Light it. Yah! Take it easy, son. What is it? What do you want? What is it? What's wrong? What is it? I don't know what you want. If you'd only tell me. Chandler! Chandler! The water coming. Let me help. Let me help. They're all out, we got 'em all. Faster, faster! Chandler, look out! It's all right, son. You must forget it, it was a long time ago. Is he all right? Oh, he finally went to sleep. A month's work, up in smoke. Maybe you should see your friend, the sheriff. What can he do? You can't go into court without evidence. You should know that. Yes, I should. Maybe I ought to just give up and sell out to them. Don't do it. I don't think I've got much choice. There's some things you learn to do without, but you can't farm without a barn. I'll need it to store the winter feed. I'll build you another. I thought you were leaving. Is that what you want? No. Then I'd like to stay, if it's all right with you. You see, I think you're right about the boy and the dog. There must be some other way. There has to be. I hope so. Can I fix you some coffee? No thanks, you better get some sleep. Well you ought to, too. All right, I'll take the coffee. Never could sleep during the daytime. You know, we gotta repair this harness when we get time. Hey, catch! Come here. Now that's better. Grab around the brake. Come on, Lance. I wonder what's keeping her. You better go tell her we're ready. What did he say? He says you're beautiful. Thank you, David. - It's a lovely gown. - You like it? It's beautiful. Thank you. I'd forgotten what it felt like to dress up. You should do it more often. Well I didn't know whether I should or not, my bonnet is hopelessly out of date. Hats can never stay in style, but my father always said that a woman without a hat is only half-dressed. I agree with your father. Thank you. David, in the back. So Linnett finally found herself a man. Today is my last day at home. I'm moving right out. Yes indeed, starting off at one dollar. Look at the Burleighs, huh. Only one dollar, just think of it. Step up folks, and I'll take 'em, miraculous likeness, of you and your loved ones. A likeness that will rival all the artists of Europe. Step up, folks. Would you like your picture taken, oh, don't be nervous little lady. I'll take your picture. It's strong, Mrs. Ainsley. Take a strong wind to break this one. Good for rain or shine. Oh, it's you. Got some silver of yours. - $15 worth. - Mm-hm. Where's your stock of trousers? Over there on the counter. Thank you, come on, David. Linnett, I almost didn't recognize you. Such pretty dress, even if I didn't sell it to you. I'll be with you in a minute. Don't you have any without tassels? They're making them all with tassels, Mrs. Ainsley. If you don't like them, you can cut 'em off. I suppose so. You think about it. Gorman. Who's that man with her? Well, who knows? All right sonny, are you buying or looking? Eh, what'll it be, sonny? Chocolate, hard candy? Well make up your mind, sonny. The chocolate is short and sweet, but the hard candy lasts longer. Oh, in a minute you'll be sorry you didn't listen to me. But I was the same when I was a little boy. Come sit down, son. These look good and strong. They all look strong to me, Linnett. You never called me that before. Matter of fact, I was getting tired of all that ma'am talk. You made me sound 10 years older than I am, and no gentleman would do that. Do you mind? No, no, I just mentioned it. Come here, David, try these on. There, behind this counter. Why Linnett, it's been ages. Nobody ever sees you anymore. Why, just the other day at the Union League Social everybody was talking about you and nobody knew what to say. What have you been doing with yourself out on that farm? - What? - Your package, Mrs. Ainsley. - Oh, excuse me. - Your purse! You forgot your purse, Mrs. Ainsley, just a minute. - Thank you. - Thank you. I'll take a picture of you and your loved ones. Well it's, look at the new picture takers. Why don't you have a picture taken, Linnett, with your pretty dress and bonnet? What would I do with it? Look at it now and then. In 10 years from now, you'll know what you looked like today. Go on, take a picture while I fit the boy's trousers. Go on. Come on, Linnett. Now let's see. I bet these pants fit like a glove. Step up, and for one dollar, I'll take a picture that will rival the genius of Leonardo. Only one dollar, just think of it. Step up, folks. And I'll take a miraculous likeness of you and your loved ones. A likeness that will rival all the artists of Europe. Step up, folks. Go ahead, Linnett. I'm nervous. Oh don't be nervous, little lady. Sit right down here, and do as I tell you, and you'll have a memento that will last you for a lifetime. There, now get comfortable, and sit back, and put your head against this. There you are, my dear. Now sir, will you step in, and take off your hat please? It's better with your hat off. And then, if you'll just hold that pose for a minute now. Now let me see, oh yes, that's delightful. Will you smile a little please, lady? And you smile, too? Thank you very much. Oh, that's very good, yes indeed it is. Now, are we ready? All right, just let me see. You're name's Chandler. I know all about you. You're livin' at Linnett's. My father says you ain't got no tongue. Is that right? That's him. That's the one I was tellin' you about. The one you says ain't got no tongue? All right, open your mouth. Let's see if you've got a tongue. All right, dummy, open your mouth! If he won't open his mouth, pinch him. That'll make him open it. Look, he ain't even alive. He don't even yell when you pinch him, watch! Open your mouth! Go on, open it! We just wanna see if you got a tongue! Stop it! Stop this fighting! What are you doing here? - Dummy! - Hey, dummy! Get outta here! - Dummy, bye, dummy, beat it! - Dummy! - David! - Dummy! Hey dummy, go on, dummy, get outta here. Hey dummy, beat it! Are you all right, David? Take him in and clean him up. Get him another pair of trousers. I'll be right back. Mr. Bates. Oh, it's you, deal me out. I wanna talk to you about the dog. Do you still wanna buy him? Hmm, maybe yes, maybe no. How much you want for him? 300. 300, that's a little high, isn't it? Tell you what, I'll give you 150. I'm not bargaining, Mr. Bates. It's 300, do you want him or don't you? 200. Now wait a minute. You are the hardest man I ever dealt with. All right. You got yourself a deal. Where is he? I'll bring him tomorrow afternoon, if it's all right with you. Sure. And I'd like to have my money now. What kind of a deal is this you're tryin' to pull? You want the money now but I don't get the dog now? That's the deal, you just have to trust me. All right. I'll be waiting. Thank you. Deal me in, gentlemen. Are you going to tell him? No, now's not the time. When it's all over, I'll tell him. He'll understand better then. I hope so. Linnett? Yes. About the operation. I was wondering if it wouldn't be better for you to go to Minnesota with David. Why? Oh, I just think he'd feel better with you and, I might never come back but you will. Besides, I gotta get the barn up, the wheat needs harvesting, and you never know what the Burleighs are gonna do. Will you, Linnett? If that's the way you want it. Yes it is, Linnett. Well David, you'll be leaving in a minute. Say goodbye to Lance. He'll be all right, David. You can't take him with you now. You might be gone a long time. Now wait a minute. You're not gonna spoil everything, are you? It's best this way, David. We can't take him with us. Hey, he's not going to back out now. Not after all the trouble we went through. Thee wouldn't do that to us, would thee, son? Look, I brought thee a bag of candy for the trip. Thee scared, David? No, thee's a fine lad. And next time I see thee, thee won't be shaking thy head. Thee'll tell me. All right folks, all aboard, we're ready to go. - All right, folks. - Come here, David. All aboard. Son, I don't know what's gonna happen. Nobody does. Sometimes we have to do things that we don't want to do. Gonna be a good boy? Come on. Up you go. Linnett, take care of yourself. You, too. He should be all right, David. Linnett, I wanted to say that-- - All right, hup! - Oh, I, I. Well, Linnett, I wanted to say. Linnett, goodbye. Ah, I've been waiting for you. I was beginning to think you was pullin' my leg. Didn't know if you was jokin' or not. I see you wasn't. Tell me, how come you changed your mind about sellin' him? I guess the price was right. Now you're talkin' my language. I always said there was a price on anything. Here's your dog. Come here boy. Go on, Lance, go to him. Come on, boy. We're gonna make a champion outta you. Come on now, get over here. Come on, Lance, here. Here. Tomorrow, Dr. Strauss operates. The more I see of the doctor, the more I like him. He and David are the best of friends, and the doctor is teaching him to play chess. The game is beyond me. Yesterday, one of the parents brought a puppy up to one of the children, and David saw them together. It was one of the worst moments of the whole trip. I pray we've done the right thing. Chandler! I've got a letter for thee! I was in at Gorman's, and he told me he had a letter for thee. It's from Minnesota. Read it to me, Doctor. "The operation is over. "They've just started treatment. "It's too early to tell anything yet, "but Dr. Strauss says "that everything went exactly as he expected. "He says that we should know in a day or two. "I hope I'm not reading anything into how he said it, "but he sounded very optimistic. "He says that we will be able to leave here in three days "on the afternoon coach. "I hope this letter reaches you before we do. "David is anxious to get back, and I am, too. "Love, Linnett." Whoa. Whoa! How do you feel? Sorry, Chandler. Does he know about Lance? I couldn't tell him. I, I left him home. We'll, we'll stay here until it clears. You want me to tell him? It might be easier. No, I'll do it. Lance is gone, David. I sold him. I had to, David. There was no other way. It didn't work out, but that was the chance I had to take. Well, if you'd known about Lance, you just wouldn't have gone through it. I know, I know I lied to you. You can hate me, and it's all right. You see, I know what Lance meant to you. He meant a great deal to me, David. David! Don't you understand? I had to! I had to! David! David, David I had to, honest. Honest, I did. Mr. Bates. Oh, what do you want, Chandler. About the dog Lance I sold you. Dog? Mongrel's more like it. Why, he ain't worth a plug copper as a dog. Why, he's a one man dog, and I should've known better. It's the way these mongrels are. Mr. Bates, I don't know how, but I'll work out something for you. But I have to have the dog back. I'd be glad to give him back, believe me, but I ain't got him anymore. Where is he? I got rid of him, he wouldn't work the sheep, wouldn't work a single command. All he'd do is crawl around on his belly and whine. First time I ever judged wrong. Where is he, Bates? I told you, I got rid of him. - How? - Lost him in a poker game. - Who to? - Harry Burleigh. Lost him with a good hand, too. Full house, three aces up. I don't know why, but Burleigh always wanted that dog since I first got him. Well, we had us this game. Thank you, Bates. Wanna know something? He won't work for Burleigh either. Well, look, you can see for yourself. There, what'd I tell ya? Come on! Come on! Hah, hah, come on! Where are you going? I lied to David about his dog, I'm gonna get him back. With a gun? Burleigh's got him. It's the only thing he understands is a gun. I know Harry Burleigh, John. He never does anything without a reason. Well, I'm gonna find out what his reason is. You're his reason. Ever since you came here, you've been in his way. Without you, I might have given up the farm, and now he'd have it all. He doesn't want Lance, he wants you. - Please Linnett. - Listen to me, John. What good'll you be to the boy dead? Give me the gun, John. It has nothing to do with you. Yes, it does. I'm part of this now. You made me part of it. You can't just come into my life and go right out of it. I won't let you. Let me go, Linnett. John. What is it? Is it pride? Then I'll go to the Burleighs because I have no pride anymore. I don't care about the farm. You and David are all I care about. And that's got to mean something to you. It means a great deal, Linnett. There's no other way. John, John! David. David, wait. David. Look at me. I made a mistake and I'm sorry. I'll get your dog back. No, no, I'm not lying. You stay here. You understand, I'm getting your dog back. David! David! Stay here! He's coming, Jeb. Just like Pop said he would. Good. Come on. Company comin', Pop. Company was expected, wasn't it? He's headed this way, Pop. Let him come. No, no, no, no, not yet. Let's show the Reb a little hospitality, eh? This ain't no time for talkin', Pop. Let's do what we've gotta do and get it over with. There's no time to be losin' your head, either. Just leave me alone with him. You boys wait in the store room there. Go on, go on, go on, both of you. - Pop. - Go on, Tom. Come in, come in, door's open. Well, Chandler. Come in, come on in. Make yourself at home, sit down. How about a drink? No thank you. Don't mind if I do, hm? Pour it for me. The jugs are kinda hard to handle with this clipped wing of mine. Where's my dog? Your dog? You ain't accusin' us of stealin' him, are ya? You did that once before. A dog thief is just as bad as a horse thief in sheep country, you know that, don't you? All right, yours Burleigh. I want him back. I'll pay you some way, I'll work out a deal with you. But I've got to have that dog. Well, I see you're ready to talk sense. How about Linnett? Too bad about her barn burnin'. Let's talk about the dog, that's all I came to talk about. Sure, sure, sure. My boys really took a liking to him. He's just like one of the family. You're kinda touchy about the girl, ain't ya? I hear a lot of talk in town about you two. What kind of talk? Well, what kind would you expect? Handsome fella like yourself, pretty girl like Linnett living way out there away from everybody and everything. You know, you can't stop people from talkin', can you, Chandler? Not if they've got dirty minds. You know, I don't figure you, Chandler. You've given me nothing but trouble from the very first. Now, you're askin' for favors. Linnett was gettin' ready to see this whole thing my way, she was just about ready to give up her place when-- It's nothing to do with her. I came here asking a favor. Oh sure, I know. You know, this has got nothin' at all to do with her. This is for your kid, the dummy. Ain't that right, Chandler? That's right. See, I know how you feel. I got boys myself, remember? Course, what you want with a hound like that beats me because he's nothing but a one-man dog. He's like Bates said, no good. He'll work for me. Well, take him. - Take him, he's yours. - You mean it? And now you can get out of here, Chandler. Your dog's down in the tool shed. Take him and get outta here. You needn't look so surprised. It's more than you ever did for me or my sons. Go on, get out of here, Chandler, before I change my mind. Thank you. You might be out of your mind, but I'm not. Not so fast. We're gonna shoot a dog thief, how'd you like that, hmm? Jeb, you go down by the sheep pen. Tom, I want you to go down by the haystack. Now don't shoot till he comes out of the shed. You remember what I told you. We're killin' a dog thief, you got that straight, both of you? We got it. What are you sittin' there for? Come on, get outta here, like I told ya. David. Watch it, David, over here. David, get down! Tom! J-J-Johnny, look out! Say it. You said it, say it again! Say it! Say it! You said it! Say it again, you can do it. J-Johnny. Johnny. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! Pop, back! You gotta listen to me, Pop, just this once, you gotta listen to me! Get away, get away, you coward. I'm gonna kill you, Chandler. Don't come any closer, Burleigh, I'm warnin' you. You dirty scum! Pop! David! David! Linnett! Linnett! Linnett! Linnett! Linnett! Talk, I can talk.
