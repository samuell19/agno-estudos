[siren] Marco, give me a cigarette. No. Oh, come on. It's freezing. Well, keep moving. What we're gonna do, is we're going to stay here, we're going to keep quiet, and then we're going to wait for someone to come. And then, we're going to earn ourselves some cash. See? I told you. Listen, what day is? It's Saturday. Saturday? Saturday night? Your date with Jenny, yeah. - Yeah, I know. I know. If you ain't got no cash, you can't operate. You know what I say. When you're in this town, you gotta think violence. Violence. Well, let's do it. Could you get out of my way, please? Oh, sorry. Sure. Hey, mister, can I speak to you for a second? What's your problem, kid? Money's my fucking problem, kid. You've got it, and I want it. Yeah, money is our fucking problem, kid. Shit. What's your name, pal? Marco, sir. Well, Marco, I've got a little suggestion that's going to get you through life a lot better than what you're trying to do now. What? Get a job, Marco. Yes, sir. That's it for tonight, Louis. Unless you can find yourself a sponsor. [thumping] [non-english speech] Jack, how nice to see you. Come in. Come in. What's the matter with your door? What's the matter with you, huh? The bright bottle there. Sorry, Jack, house rules. What goes for you, goes for me. It's about time you it cleaned up, huh? What's the matter? Can't sleep? The wonderful world of network television. Travel to faraway exotic lands, meet warm and interesting people, watch them die. Sorry, Jack. It's all right, Eddie. Hello. You're watching Newsbeat on Channel 12. I'm Belinda Jones. And I'm Buck McDermott. And the main news story tonight, the disappearance of four Taipei nuclear warheads from the United States nuclear test installation in Florida still remains a mystery. News from the White House reports that President Douglas is highly concerned by the situation, but maintains there is no definitive course of action to be taken until the Middle Eastern leaders contact the President on the outcome of their top security meeting. Channel 12's man at the gulf, Phil Jackson, sends this report. Looking good, Jack. Looking good. Better? Good. Come on, we've got work to do. CALLINGTON: Kath, Jack, say hello to Ben Gibson. He's going to record sound for you. Hi. I feel like a mutineer in this building today. I'm aware you know of my decision to air Jack's footage tonight. News travels fast around here, especially if I make it. But I want you to understand. This is a business. I don't want to do it, but I'm not the only one making decisions. There are people I have to answer to, members of the board, stockholders, most of them didn't even know Willis. Loneliness of command, huh, boss? Billy was part of my very first staff. He worked for me when this station was nothing but a camera in a studio that was my garage. Now, I've made my decision, and like every good leader, I'm going to stand by it. End of discussion. Welcome to the team, Ben. You'll be working with two of the very best pros in this business. Keep an eye on them for me. I'll do my best, Mr. Callington. I'm sure you will. Well? CALLINGTON: Kath? You seem uneasy about something. Want to talk? I know what you're doing here. Young kid, good at his job, you want to get new blood into the system, right? Precisely. But new doesn't necessarily mean inexperienced. I can't promise when I'm out there next time I'm going to be able to look over my shoulder every two minutes. I'm not asking you to. Fortunately, for me, that's the way you've always handled things. Didn't work for Willis, did it? You look tired, Kath. Still having those nightmares? Why don't you take some time off at the beach house? I don't need anything from you, George. I just have to-- I'll work it out. I'm thinking of taking some time off. Holiday? I was thinking of something a little more practical than that. I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Of course. If there's anything I can do for you. Oh, how's it going? This is definitely bad news. I'm a professional sound man. How can I work with this shit? This is crap. I don't give a shit where you've been or what you've done, but around here, we work as a family. It's a pretty good system because we watch each other's backs. It works. Now, are you gonna play the game or are you just gonna give me shit? This equipment was good enough for Billy, and it's going to be good enough for you. Jack, I'm only new here. Try to make a good impression on your first day, OK, pal? [phone ringing] [door opening] Jack, we're old friends, right? Last time I looked. So if I were to ask you what could be called a personal question, you answered it, wouldn't you? Sure. How many times you been hungover this week? Kath, you are not my mother. Your problem, pal, is that you care too much. [knocking] Hi, Katie, what's happening? Hi, Jack. Yo, Katie? We've got a hostage situation over at Nicholson's mansion. Some guys go crazy with a machine gun. The police and troops are already there, but-- Yeah, I know, he wants cameras. Tell his story to the whole world. Usual shit. Tell the desk we don't do domestic. They know, but there's nobody else. No one? In the entire department? I gotta call Callington. You can't. He's in a meeting. A very important meeting. Yeah, probably some big shareholders meeting to discuss the color of the wallpaper. OK, bad boy, come and earn your keep. I wanted TV. I want it now. Not much to say. He wants to talk to the cameras. Where are they? Over there in the bushes. Was he armed? Very. And he's really pissed off about something. I can't figure it out. You got snipers? Yeah. We've got four of them dug out out there. Well, you're as safe as you can be. OK, Mr. Dillon, the cameras are here. You stay right there. You just park right there, lady. Mr. Nicholson, are you all right? You shut up, lady. You just stand there, and do what I say. We're recording. The name's Dillon. I work at the dockyards, eh. I got two boys, one 8 and one 14. Three months ago, I find out my boy's a heroin addict. I spent two and a half months trying to track down the source. You know what I find? I find this piece of shit here. He owns this place. So why they the guy, Mr. Dillon? Why didn't you just go straight to the police? No chance, lady. Money puts this guy a way above the law. I know. OK. Just what do you intend to do with your prisoner? This son of a bitch is going for a swimming in his own fucking pool. Well, what proof do you have to substantiate your claim, Mr. Dillon? I got all the proof I need, lady. What about your children? You're to be a murderer on national television? This piece of shit is gonna taste of his own fucking medicine. Now, shut up. Sad news for all Americans today. Digger Douglas, President Douglas's dog, has died after a long illness. The President, after an emotional speech at the White House, has asked all Americans everywhere to take a minute out today and show your pets how much you love them. Buck. And Channel 12's award winning team, Jack Slater, Kath Hanzaker, and Billy Willis send us these pictures from the Gulf. [gunshot] [phone ringing] Hello, this is Jack Slater. I'm not here. Please leave a message, and if you don't, well then, get lost. Thank you. [beep] KATH: Jack. It's me. Listen, I need to talk. Find me at my place as soon as you can. It's important. Bye. [doorbell] All right. I'm coming. So, what's the big surprise? Page 35. NEWS ANCHOR: Expelled all Western journalists from his country. President Douglas outraged by the deaths of 7 Americas, warned that if General Zarab did not comply with international legislation, he would have no choice but to take positive steps to maintain global peace. Survival Island? Is this a joke? Are you really into this shit? Sure? Why not? It's all healthy. It was Ben's idea, and I am-- I am not interested in paying money to play soldiers for a month. It's as much for Ben as it is for us, Jack. It's nothing we can't handle, and I think we'll come out better for it. Better for what? Out there, next time. Are we going? Yeah. Congratulations. You've all just failed the first test. Lewis T. Holden, Sergeant, United States Marine Corps. Retired. But not too long ago, so don't underestimate me. Follow me. Excuse me, gentlemen? You gentlemen have a unique sense of humor. It wasn't humor, Slater. Mr. Slater to you, please. First rule. Never walk into an installation unprepared. Looks more like Boy Scout camp to me. Put our things in the bunkhouse, Mr. Slater. Think she's made a new friend, Jack. I mean, what do you do on an island like this? No TV, no stereo, no women. Drive a guy crazy. Maybe. Jesus. What's in this? It's an old family recipe. I don't want to be part of your family, I'll tell you. The peninsula's my favorite part. I go there to work out my troubles. I spend a lot of time there these days. Must be in your mind, Sergeant. How could anyone have problems living in a place like this? Got a light? Let's call your boys over here. I've got something to show them. KATH: Jack? OK, gentlemen. It's pretty self-explanatory. I'd like to draw your attention to this red area here. Now, we are standing on an ex-military installation. That means certain areas are still mined. Haven't had a chance to screen them all yet. Now this is a tracer. Sew that into your uniform. Should you become lost, separated, we'll find you with that. You carry this thing with you? Always. It's designed for your own protection, Slater. Let's move out. I want to make the peninsula in an hour. Always. Now for the part of the program our clients usually find the most interesting, target practice. Please keep in mind that Sergeant Macbain and I have broken out the live ammo, so please exercise extreme caution at all times. The name of this game, people, is shoot the enemy. But for now, you'll just shoot at the targets you see directly in front of you. Any questions? All right, we'll go into basic procedures. First step. [alarm] RADIO ANNOUNCER: This is FWT Radio. It's 8 o'clock, and this is the World News. The headlines. General La Shiraz has declared war on all countries who support the American and Western position on weapon deployment in the Gulf. After the execution of seven Americans as spies, President Douglas has had no alternative but to take action. General Chirac, who until today denied these executions took place, has suddenly changed his tactics regarding Western propaganda. Senator Bill Jefferson, Defense Secretary, stated in Congress, that this was a sign that General Shiraz has resigned himself to all out war. Angry protesters gathered around the White House, banners of remember Nam and Hiroshima where clearly visible. It now remains to be seen if President Douglas orders the offensive use of nuclear weapons. The implications of which can only be measured on a global scale. And news at home. In Southern California at 11 PM last night-- When did that get here? A couple of days ago on their chopper. Sergeant, I told you not to requisition these parts. Hi, guys, I've got a question about this Amanita muscaria. We'll talk about it in the morning. Sure. No problem. Goodnight. Don't pull rank on me, Holden. You're not my superior anymore. No, I'm not. But I do have seniority here, and this is way out of line. No, you're out of line. I thought we were partners, that means joint decisions, right? Hey, you want to go solo? Let's go solo. RADIO ANNOUNCER: A somber calm has descended upon the States, a blanket of fear for the safety of the world, the threat of an aerial thermonuclear war in the Gulf is not yet definite, but in the eyes of the American public, a very real one. This is John Adams with the FWT News at 8:00 PM. Never underestimate your enemy, Mr. Slater. One down, two to go. Next time, Macbain, use the sharp end. Jack? Jack, what are we doing here, man? Professional curiosity. Crazy bastard could be anywhere, man. I hope he realizes it's still a game. What's this? Give me a hand, and we'll find out. After you, pal. Jack, I'm not going down there, Jack. Yes, you are. No way. Look how deep it is. - Ben. - Jack, no. We'll toss for it. We'll toss. Jack, why do I have to go first? I won the toss. Jack, I think there are rats here. At least it's not a snake. Jack, there isn't something quite right here. What do you got? Jack, check this out. Jack, let's get our of here. Now. Ben, I need some answers here. No, this isn't anything. "The Survivalists Handbook." Lewis T. Holden. Let's go, Jack. Merry Christmas, Ben. Listen to this, Ben. And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea having 7 heads and 10 horns, and upon his horns 10 crowns, and upon his heads was the name of blasphemy. Jesus. Who wrote that? It's "The Bible," Ben. Hey, Jack? Huh? Says here there is a concentration of vitamin B in a polar bear's liver that's enough to kill ya. Ben, Ben, Ben, did you bump your head again today? Jack, don't you ever stop? Good man. Jack, tell me a story. Once upon a time, there were three bears. No, Jack, I've heard that one before. Tell me another one. What do you want to hear? BEN: A juicy one? Did I ever tell me about the time Kath and I-- Oh, I like that, Jack. Go on. - No. She'd kill me if I told you that. Jack, listen to this. The offensive use of nuclear power is likely to be preceded by a gradual escalation of the military situation. There is likely to be a period when those who wish could take positive protective measures. However, there is no guarantee of warning and proper fallout shelters cannot be erected rapidly. Many people now believe it is worth building shelters as a precaution. Although others, especially in targets areas, may feel that the whole operation is pointless. Any who escape annihilation will need a survival mentality more than in any other survival situation. Shit. [twigs snapping] I know you're there, Jack. Jack? Jack? Jack? Gibson? Ben? Ben? Ben? - Jack. - Ben? Ben? - Jack. I'm here, pal. Why me? Holden! Holden! Get out here. We need some help. Holden! Looks like a landmine. You know, I told you people to be careful. Bullshit, Holden, this was no landmine. Now, you get on the radio, and you get some help here. Macbain, Macbain, get his feet. Jack. Jack. Jack. Stay with him, Kath. I've got a call to make. What's happening, Holden? Why don't you tell me. Why don't I tell you? Who fragged my friend? Who smashed the radio, Holden? All right, who else is on this island but you and Macbain? God damn it, tell me. No one. I walk in my office, you're here, the radio's smashed, so why don't you tell me. I don't know. I'm not a doctor. Even if we had a hospital. He's gonna die, isn't he? Oh, Ben. The supply chopper will be here in 36 hours. My friend needs help now, god damn it. Don't do it, man. The situations bad enough. You tell him that i will take your life. Put it away, Sergeant. Come on, Slater. It's your choice, but this time I'm using the sharp end. I think your friend could use your help right now. Oh, Ben. First order of survival. Don't trust anybody. Sh. Don't talk. Don't trust anybody. What are you saying? It-- it hurts. What happened to you? Grenade. Grenade. No. No. It was a landmine. Remember, first order of survival. I don't even trust you. Ben. Don't you do this to me. Catching up on old news, Sergeant? Don't forget, I was acquitted of those charges. I don't think running away to an island is the act of an innocent man. What are you getting at? What happened to Gibson? It's like I said, he wandered into a minefield. No. This area's been secure for years. You said so yourself. There are no minefields. Are you accusing me? I'm not accusing anyone. RADIO ANNOUNCER: Carrying the newly developed Pegasus radar invisible missiles. The submarines will be in the Gulf within eight hours. And their orders are simple and specific, should the enemy engage, nuclear weapons are-- [static] Macbain? MACBAIN: Here. HOLDEN: I lost the news report tonight, but I heard enough. What I want you to do is-- MACBAIN: Copy, out. Macbain? Macbain? Macbain? Damn it. MACBAIN: Holden! Holden here, go ahead. MACBAIN: It's happening, man. They're here. Moving out. We are in trouble. Sergeant, get a hold of yourself. What's going on out there? MACBAIN: I don't know. I don't know, man. The pilot's trying to destroy the island. He was in trouble. He bailed out. Affirmative. Hold your position. I'm on my way, Do you understand? Fuck that, man. I'm moving out. Sergeant? Shit. You all right? Yeah. OK, come on, let's get out of here. Where the hell's he going? We better get out of here. I know where he's going. He wants to kill Macbain I knew it. [inaudible] Let's do it. I know what he's doing. He's baselining. I know. Wake up. Who are you? Bad guy for the patrol, huh? How many more are coming? How many more you got coming? Leave him. It's only the first attack, man. There'll be more. This isn't about the war, or an attack on the island. It's about her, isn't it? Yeah. And there's only enough room in the bunker for two. Know what I mean? Get a hold of yourself. Holden. [beeping] - They're here. - Who? What? What are you talking about? They're here. We have to leave now. Get down. Enemy troops on this island, man. I don't know how many. Didn't get close enough. What the hell are you talking about, Macbain. What I am talking about is Holden's dead. The fuckers killed him. Macbain, is there any transport that can get us off this island now? I mean, right away, man. Nothing. Everything's brought in by supply chopper. What? You don't have a boat? We wouldn't last five minutes in a boat. All right, listen to me carefully. There's an old abandoned mine shaft not far from here. I've been working on it for a while now. It's kind of a shelter. I think we can make it. If we lose ourselves inside the tunnels, they'll never find us. We'd be safe for a while. Maybe. Look, if you'd rather go it on your own, be my guest, man, if you think you can make it. No arguments for now, Jack. I mean it. Come on, man. We've got five seconds, and I'm gone. All right, Macbain, but just you remember, I'm watching you. Nice going, Macbain. What are we doing up here? I think I can see a way down. It's a long climb, but I think we can do it. The first thing a commanding officer would do in an installation like this, station a couple of guards outside. This way, we can double check. Ladies first. OK, keep going. There's an old mine down below. I'm going. Damn it. Now, go inside. 60 feet to your left, you'll find a fuse box. Turn on the lights. OK, let's go. You're next. Give us a hand here? [inaudible] Bye, Jack. I heard shots. Are you-- Where's Jack? Where's Jack? What are you doing? Stop! Stay there. Don't move again. Make yourself at home. Put the gun down, Sean. I've had enough. Please? I'm no threat to you. I don't want to be your enemy too. I know, but how much longer are you going to point a gun at me? Thank you. Why did you kill my friends? Because-- because I-- Because you want me? Yes. You got what you want. You've beaten the competition. What do we do now? We stay here. We've got everything we need. You're running from nothing. You don't know that. All the newspaper reports, and the radio reports, all the signs point-- They've always pointed that way. Don't you see? We'll get that close, but we'll never really get there, which makes all of this rather pointless, don't you think? Do you know what it's like to lose someone close? Someone really close? Yes. So you must know how I'm feeling right now? Don't you think I'm taking it well? You're strong. I knew you-- I don't even need to be a great judge of character to read you. You're a killer. A coward. Shut up. Shut up now, you understand? Go on. [inaudible] Jack? Jack? I hate fucking heights. I'm back, Macbain. Surprised to see me? So is this what it's all about? You hide out in your little love nest until the dust settles? Let her go! I'll see you in hell, Slater. Kath, what the hell's going on? Come on. Come on! Back. Jesus, it hurts. Well, I think I can walk. Well, I can't walk with you on my back. OK? All right. Wait here. I'm going to see how far it is. Hey, I feel like shit. You look like shit. Kath! Kath! Kath! MACBAIN: I'm a survivor, Slater. What are you? Show yourself, you son of a bitch. MACBAIN: You people make me sick. You don't think, don't prepare. When it happens, man, I'm the first you'll come to. You hear me? Jack! Jack. [laughing] Jack be nimble, Jack be quick. Jack better hide, or I'll blow off your dick. Give it your best shot. Time out. Just kidding. Come on. Come on, Jack, baby. You're standing on my foot, Jack. Bye, Jack. Jackie boy, how are you doing? Don't you recognize me? What are you doing here? I thought you were in the Gulf covering the peace talks. Jack, you got a problem? [music playing]
