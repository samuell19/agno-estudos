I'm only gonna go through this once. This is how it breaks down. Remember when I told you I was 18? Well, I meant 18-ish. As in 17. As in underage. Which makes you, how shall I put this nicely? A disgusting perv? A loathsome child molester? Let's just settle on utterly unelectable. But I'm not here to judge. We all have our little weaknesses. Mine is Little Debbie snack cakes. Yours just happens to be underage girls. Now, I'm not sure how your wife or daughters might feel about that, but I'm pretty sure the voters of Franklin County would be more than a little disturbed if they saw this vivid, if not graphic, recording of the entire nasty business. Especially the part where you call me Brittany, which I'm pretty sure is the name of your oldest daughter. How old is she now, 16? What the fuck? Relax. I've already uploaded it to the cloud. All right, here are your three options. One. I upload the video online for the world to see. I'm just gonna assume that's not an option you'd be interested in. Two. You accept responsibility for what you've done, and pay for your sins. You know like a sin tax. $500 to be deposited into a private internet bank account on the 1st of every month. You bitch. Oh that reminds me, there's also a penalty for insults. So now that's 1,000 plus 500 per month. I'm not giving you shit, you slut. Keep going, I'll have college paid for before I leave the room. All done? Okay, so 2,000 plus 500 per month. Wait. Wait. You said there was a 3rd option? You introduce me to someone with more money and more at stake. Another politician, someone at the state level. Preferably a senator, but a representative will do. It just has to be someone with your same, uh, nasty little inclinations. I'm sure you know someone. Birds of a feather, and all that. You expect me to pimp you to my colleagues? That's 3,000. I'll email you the bank account number. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, just wait a minute, okay? I find you someone and that ends this? And I don't owe you anything? Well, you still owe me $3,000, I mean let's face it, you were pretty rude. Shit! He didn't show. You want me to pick her up? No, get him to the Inn and set things in order there. I'm so sorry I'm late, Donna. I tried to get back by five. You said you'd be back by five. I know. I know and I'm truly sorry. And you are behind on your payments. I know. I know and I'm working on it. I'll have it soon. They're gonna cut his services if you don't settle your account. I know, I'll drive over a check tomorrow. What you playing? Looks fun. Norman Foley? Yeah? Here. What is it? How the fuck should I know? Who's it from? Finn. Tiring, motherfucker. Have you seen her yet? What's the point? She's the only family you've got now. I've got you. If I could just convince you to retire. Oh, I could never leave the business. Your father and I built up that place up from nothing. It's where I want to be when I go. Uh mom you've already done that. I know, it's not enough. Well maybe try it first? It's fine. Have you seen her yet? There was something important I was going to tell you. Leonard said something. Leonard? You know, Leonard. No. Finn sent him to help out at the Inn. That was years ago. I've been gone a long time, mom. It hasn't been that long. Now what was it he said? I remember. It was about that man. The man, the one who had something to do with what happened to Lauren. Hello? Mr. Pee-or-sorry? I'm Norman, Norman Foley. It never ceases to astonish me, the ease with which western tongues mangle my name. I'm sorry, I just... Relax, it's an observation, not a condemnation. For what it's worth to you, the name is pronounced Pure-ray-ah-sah-ray. But you can call me Finn. Most people find it easier to manage. Why Finn? Because I'm Finnish. Oh. The reason I wanted to talk to you... Concerns certain creative liberties you took with your employer's accounts and some unprincipled opportunist stumbled upon your plan and is seeking to make his fortune at your expense. I'm not a bad person. Please. Mr. Foley. None of that is necessary. I'm not the type of man who's encumbered by moral judgment. So you can help me? I can. How much is that going to cost? Now, what kind of man would I be if I took financial advantage of someone who is already being taken financial advantage of? But if you aren't gonna charge me anything? Well it's quite simple, really. I do a favor for you now and then sometime in the future, should the need arise, you return the favor. A universe set in balance by a simple, equitable exchange. What would you want me to do? Well, there's no way of knowing until the need arises. Which might not ever happen. But if it does, I can assure you that I what I ask of you will be no more than what I'd do for you. So you may just want me talk to somebody for you? If that's what it comes to. But in the interest of full disclosure, I need to make one point very clear. Should a man come to you with a request from me at some point in the future, I expect you to do me that favor. Should you refuse, I would be obligated to take action. Please understand that I don't traffic in good or bad, I don't concern myself with legal or illegal. Those are just constructs, man-made concepts. They change from moment to moment, depending upon who's in power at any given point and time. But justice? Justice is part of the fabric of the universe. It's what maintains equilibrium. One set of actions balancing another set of actions. The sparrow eats the wheat. The hawk eats the sparrow. That's justice. Without it, everything would be out of kilter. So if we reach an agreement today, you need to make sure you hold down your end of the bargain. Otherwise, everything you cherish and everyone you love... Calculating, Florida. I've got nothing to say to you. That surprises me. I thought you'd be anxious to meet the man behind Lauren's tragedy. He's an accountant. Leads a rather nondescript life, as I understand. I've arranged for him to be at your mother's bed and breakfast this weekend. Well you can undo it 'cause I'm not going anywhere near the Inn. I'm done. I had to call in a lot of favors, you know. And that's your bad luck. As far as I'm concerned, we're square. As soon as you return the revenue from Spring Grove. Well that money's mine, I earned it. I don't see how you can justify that claim. 13 years in peels. Fair enough, keep 10% for your trouble, we'll call it even. And tell me where you are and... I think I got to a way to get him there. Leave this to me. That was quick. I'm always serious. Yeah, a senator will work, which district? Are you fucking with me, 'cause I don't like to be fucked with? The United States Senate? You'll forgive me if I don't believe you. The whole weekend? And he deposited this for incidental expenses? All right. When? Okay, I'll wait for your email. Understand, you will be there to make sure what is supposed to happen does, in fact, happen. If I thought the accountant was capable of fulfilling his obligation, I wouldn't even be sending you, but frankly, I don't think it's in his nature. All that matters is that she is handled and that Tom thinks the accountant is responsible, and then Tom avenges his loss and we have him where we want him. No, no, please don't. Please. Oh no. No, no, no, no please! Don't, don't hurt me, please! Take whatever you want. I swear I won't call the police. You'd like young girls. I could get you a girl. I could get you... She'll be there. Hey, I'm on the road right now. Can I call you back? No, out of town, why? Say that again. Did you invite her? Did you? Never mind, I know who's behind it. I'll be there. I'll be back Sunday night. If you anything, just call or text. And I left his doctors number on the fridge. Hey I've got to go, sweetie, all right? But I'll be back in a couple days. You be good. Where are you going? I've got something I have to take care of. What do you mean, you have something you have take care of? I can't explain it, just trust me, all right? And don't ask questions. Have you lost your mind? You don't expect me to sit back and say nothing while you run off without a word of explanation? Yes, Martha, in this one singular instance. That is precisely what I expect. Well forget it because I want to know what's is going on. Please. Martha, if I could tell you anything, I would tell you everything, but I can't tell you anything. Since when do we keep secrets from each other? Listen, I know what this looks like. You just have to trust me. I have to do this for you. For the kids, for the life we've built together. Well if that's true, then I'm a part of it, and you can damn well tell me what it's about. I can't. What was I going to do? Prep dinner. That's it. Because Finn has people coming, right? We're not supposed to mention that name. Remember, Peggy? Of course I remember. But, Finn has people coming, right? People are coming. Right. I knew that. Shit. Thanks for stopping. Sure. I didn't know what I was gonna do. I'm Margo. Tom. Well, Tom, if you could just drop me off at a gas station or a convenience store, I'd really appreciate it. There are no gas stations out here. No convenience stores. Anyplace with a phone, then, would be great. I can't get any service on my cell. Well this whole area is a dead zone. There are no phones and we're too far away from a cell tower to get a signal. I'm afraid you're a long way from nowhere. There's supposed to be a bed and breakfast somewhere. Yeah, the Inn at Birches Gardens. Yeah, that's it. Would you mind just dropping me off there? That's where I'm headed, but, to be honest, there's a Holiday Inn just off the highway and it's much nicer. I'd be happy to give you a lift over there. I appreciate the offer, but I'm actually meeting someone. So, if it's not too much trouble. You're not gonna make me walk all the way in this storm, are you? What am I saying? I'm saying I packed it. It's here, I promise you that. Maybe you put it in the trunk. I didn't put it in the trunk. I would remember if I put it in the trunk. I'm just saying maybe. There's no maybe, you know. You know how I know? This hip, that's how I know. Here we go with the hip. It's like a barometer, this hip. And this morning it was aching like a son-of-a-gun. And you know what that means. I know what that means. Rain, and boy do we have the rain. So why would I pack the umbrellas in the trunk if I knew it was gonna rain? I wouldn't, that's the truth of it. Okay. Okay, I believe you. Okay, maybe I left it in the trunk. You two are drenched. Leonard, grab some towels. Oh please don't bother, it's just a little water. We'll dry off when we get to our room. We better get you two checked in then. Name? Rosenbaum, Walter and Carol. We have you in room two, just at the top of the stairs. Leonard can show you the way. Once you get all settled in, come on back down and Leonard'll mix you up a nice cocktail before dinner. I could go for a good Gin Rickey. You know that one, Leonard? It is Leonard, right? I mean I hope you don't mind me calling you Leonard? Hey, did I tell you I had a friend named Leonard once? He lived in Pittsburgh. Have you been to Pittsburgh? Thanks for the lift. Oh. Oh dear, let me help you. Oh well. You don't look any worse for the wear. Leonard'll get you a towel as soon as he gets back. Meanwhile come on in, make yourself to home while I get you checked in. I'm Margo. Margo Simpson. I know who you are, dear. Can I get you something to warm your bones? Jack and coke? A hot chocolate would be more appropriate, don't you think? Hmm. And so you are. Ah, that's what I'm looking for. You know, I've slept in hotels in every major city in the world and I am here to tell you that the bar is the heart of every last one of 'em. Hey, haven't I always said that, Chooki? What's that dear? That the heart of every hotel is the bar? Name your poison. Gin Rickey. Don't be particular, Walter. Maybe I'll have a brandy instead. Brandy, that I can do. And you? Wine, any color, any year. For mercy's sake, close that door. Hey, get you gentlemen towels. You don't mind, do you? Oh, gosh. That's enough to set your heart cross ways. Seems like we're missing someone. Are we? Did we set too many? No, the table's right. Of course it is. That's the bearded fellow, came in earlier. What was his name? Oh you know, it was one of those names. I believe his name was Norman. Oh yes, of course, that's it. And we're expecting one more? I don't think so, just the five. Just five, right? There you go. I'm afraid you missed the soup. Sorry, I was trying to a call. Oh you won't find much fortune there, I'm afraid. Our guests usually prefer to avoid contact with the outside world. But you do have a computer, right? No computers, no phones and only one road in. It's part of the charm of the place. This is quite a storm we're having. You'll get plenty of sun on the ship, Walter. Ship? We're taking a transatlantic cruise to celebrate Walter's retirement. A whole month. What are you retired from? Work. He's just being cute. Don't pay any attention. Walter is in public relations. And what do you do, Norman? Numbers. You mean like gambling? No, no, I'm a bookkeeper. You know receivables, cash flow, profit and loss. I'm the one who balances the accounts. I know someone just like that. Keeps things in balance. He does very well for himself. He lives in a huge... Peggy. So you're an accountant. It's my own recipe. The secret is nutmeg. Where'd the guy with the beard go? He's on the back porch, checking out the rain, I guess. I'll let him know dessert's ready. Why is she here, mom? Why is who here, dear? Margo. Finn didn't say. He just said to expect her. I thought he was doing it for you, as a favor. Are you him? Who? I know it's not the Irishman because he has too many rough edges. And I know it's not the old man because he brought his wife with him. That leaves you. I know you're married and I know you left your wife at home. Wait, wait, wait. How do you know I have a wife? So, is it you? Are you him pretending to be an accountant? I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. So he's not here. You need anything else? No, you go on to bed, Leonard. See you tomorrow. Sweet dreams. What in the world? Jesus Christ, have you been there all night? I bet there's a story there. What are you fussing about? I was thinking we could whip up some mimosas, but there's no orange juice, there's no champagne. No ice. Good morning. Morning. Good morning. Is there coffee? Nothing's been laid out. Will breakfast be soon? And some champagne and orange juice would be welcome. What's this? Oh. Mom, mom! Oh my god, what happened? She's been shot. I need towels and tape. I've got tape. All right, let's get her to a couch. We need blankets and something to keep her head elevated. Is she gonna be all right? Well the bleeding's stopped, but there's no way to know how much damage the bullet's done on the inside. We need to get her to a hospital. You can use my car. We can't risk it. Those bullet fragments are like razor blades and if we move her too much it could kill her. Hey, where's the accountant? Did you shoot her? Oh God, he sent you, didn't he? No one sent me, I'm here because of what you did. You mean what I didn't do. I'm just not that kind of person. I'm an ordinary, run-of-the-mill, mow-the-lawn-on-Sunday kind of guy. Maybe you could explain that to him. To who? The guy that sent you, the Finnish guy. Finn? Finn, that's him. Look, I don't care what happens to me. But my wife and kids, they had nothing to do with this. Finn sent you here? To kill someone. Who? So it was you that shot her. Didn't shoot her, didn't shoot her. I couldn't do it. Then why is she lying downstairs with a bullet in her gut? Wait, what? Someone shot Peggy? Yeah, you shot her. I didn't, I swear. You expect me to believe that Finn sent you here to shoot my mom and my mom got shot and it wasn't you? It's the truth. Where's your gun? Bedside table. This hasn't been fired. That's what I've been telling you. So why would Finn send you? To return a favor. What favor? He said he could help. I thought that meant he was just gonna send someone to talk to the guy. You know, put the scare into him. Make him back off. But he took it further than that. Much farther. And now he wants me to do the same for him. And the woman? What woman? I don't know her. That your family? Yeah. Downstairs, let's go. How is she? The same. All right, first things first. We're gonna need to get an ambulance for my mom as quickly as possible. She's your mother? That means someone's gonna have to drive far enough to pick up a signal and call 9-1-1. I'll go. I'd prefer someone I can trust. What the hell's that supposed to mean? Do you mind going? I would, but my car's broken down. If you're looking for someone you can trust, Carol and I can go. Norman can take you. You don't mind, do you Norman? Norman? Huh? Yeah, yeah, I can go. Just drive until you get service, call an ambulance and then come right back. How do you know you can trust me? Can't I? You can, but why don't you just go yourself? Because I can't trust them. Do you think she's really his mother? Of course, why would he lie? I don't know. I used to lie about it when I was in school. You lied about who your parents were? I used to say my mom was a teacher who worked with underprivileged children and my dad designed bridges. It helped explain why they were never around. Where were they? They were dead. Sorry. It was a long time ago. How did, you know? An accident. A fire. I was nine years old. My brother and I were in the bedroom. He was only two at the time. Anything? We'll have to try the other direction. Peggy said there was only one road in. People say a lot of shit. They should have been back by now. I'm going to check on them. Sit back down. What? Who the fuck you think you are? You don't tell me what to fuckin' do. Whoa, whoa, Tom, there's no need for that. Tell that to my mother. You don't honestly think Leonard... I don't think anything. But somebody shot her. But not him. Are you confessing? How about you, Carol, did you shoot her? Don't be absurd. Then that limits the possibilities then, doesn't it? Well if you ask me, you let the most likely suspect drive out of here with your blessing. That would explain why they're not back yet. My money's on the accountant. The road's flooded. How badly? The only way you're getting across is a boat. So we're trapped? Well we could wade through the water and walk out, but there's no way an ambulance is getting through it. Tom, you look like a man who could use a jolt. Whisky, isn't it? Mom? What did you do? I'd shut the fuck up, if I were you. Good. You're awake. Let's not mix words, Tom. Are you trying to mince words? What? Because the phrase is mince words. Don't be a prick. We both know how this has to play out. You can't keep the money from the Spring Grove job, Tom. You know that, I know that. It belongs to Finn, and one way or another, Finn's gonna get it back. So why don't you just tell me where it is and put an end to this before people start getting hurt? Did you kill my mom? I didn't kill your mom. But I will kill you if you don't tell me where the fucking money is. What's the matter? Just realize you've got no leverage? Look around. There's leverage everywhere. But I don't need all of them, do I? I just need her. She doesn't know, does she? What are you talking about, I'm nobody. I don't know him. You may not know him, but he sure as hell knows you. What do you say, Tom? Enough leverage for you? If you kill her, you'll never see that money. Can somebody please tell me what the hell is going on? He's your father. My father is dead. Not yet, he isn't. He died in a fire with my mother. Well this is a con, isn't it? Well, it won't work. It's no con. Apparently, Tom here had a thing for your mother. You're a liar. Am I? Let me show you what I found when I searched his room. You knew my mother? Well he knew her, all right. Bullshit. Even if he knew my mom and this wasn't photoshopped, that doesn't make him my father. What kind of creep are you? How long have you been stalking me? I'm your fath... Don't say it. Don't say it, you are not my father. You never were and you never will be. What do you say, Tom? Money or flesh and blood? Like I said you can't kill her. Maybe not. But I can hurt her. No, not enough to convince you? Well, you know, there are lots of ways to hurt someone. All right, all right, stop! You can have the money. Where is it? It's hidden. It's hard to find, I'll have to take you there. You don't quit, do you? Where's the fucking money? Black Gap Road. Point eight miles north of the I-81 exit. Abandoned farmhouse in a field across from the park. Second floor bedroom. It's in the fireplace. Toss the gun away. What the fuck are you doing? Son, I've killed more men than you've met in your life, so if I tell you to toss your gun away, you should listen to me. Oh, thank God. What are you doing? I was gonna untie him. Get back where you were. Sit down. Well, none of this went the way it was supposed to. The only thing we can do now is try to set this right, as best we can. What the fuck are you talking about? Eh, eh, eh. Okay. Peggy's dead, so we have to make it look like the accountant was responsible for that. Wait, what, me? Quiet, I'm trying to think. And then, Tom. Walter, what are you doing? I'm doing what Finn wanted done. Finn? Finn doesn't want this. He just wants the money. This is your gun, right? Walter, listen to me. Okay, Norman shoots Peggy. Tom finds out and, What have you done? You shouldn't be too upset, sweetheart. After all, your pal there was responsible for your mom being shot. Well, aren't you going to go after her? With these knees? My father is dead. Not yet, he isn't. You shouldn't be too upset, sweetheart. He died in a fire with my mother. She doesn't know, does she? After all, you pal there was responsible for you mom being shot. Tell me she got away. Tell me you didn't... Relax, she's fine. I had no intention of hurting her anyway. I had no intention of hurting him either. What do you think you're doing? We're supposed to make it look like he shot Peggy, Chooki, remember? That's his gun. Yeah, I know. Oh, right, needs to be my gun, huh? So what are you planning on doing with me, if you don't mind me asking? I don't know. Finn didn't say to kill you. Finn didn't say not to kill him either. That's true. Drop the gun. Listen, you don't... Drop the fucking gun! How did you know? How did I know what? How did you know that my mother was shot? You told us. No, I didn't. I said she died in a fire. You're confused, you're not remembering clearly. Did you shot my mom? Like he could make that shot. What? Walter has always had terrible aim. He would have died a dozen times. If I didn't have his back. She's not gonna shoot. She doesn't have it in her. Trust me, dear. Look at her, she's like a frightened child. I'm warning you, I'll shoot. Don't! I should listen to you more often, Chooki. Yes, you should. I'm sorry about this. I really am. You're not dead. Close enough. It would be easy for me to kill you. God knows you deserve it, but, I don't like the thought of what that might do to my daughter. And right now, that's more important to me than getting even. Where are they? Gone. What about Finn? Don't worry about Finn. We are dealing with something greater than you and me. You must see that. The universe demands equilibrium. You can't just change that with a... How are we doing? It's great, I love it. Good. Can we have ice cream for dessert? We're all out of ice cream, honey. Well maybe dad could take us to Frosty Squeeze. Please, daddy, please. I can get you Frosty Squeeze. But you'll owe me.
