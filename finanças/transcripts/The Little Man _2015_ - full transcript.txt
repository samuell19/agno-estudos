Based on a book "The Great Journey of Little Man" Fireworks! Firecrackers! Fiery fun! No one around. What is everyone doing? Why don't they want some real racket? Damn it! -Hello! -Hi! I don't need anything. -I have all I need. -Surely you'll buy fireworks. No way. But let me show you my new house. I have just finished it. I bet you call it "At the Wooden Mallet". No, I happened to leave it there. There are still some kinks to be ironed... Watch out! -I'm a goner. -I'm coming down! -Now he's a goner. -Hello. I mean... Here I'll have flowerbeds, a bench, and a fire ring over there. If only you could see the interior! Wait here. I am not too fond of having visitors. This is where I'll have a basin, here is my table, my bed with a mattress, so soft... No, you don't have to step in. A fireplace over here, burning nicely. A picture will hang there. And that's it for now. Cool, right? Oh! And I have superb water here. Let's toast to my new house. I call it "A Hollow Hill", good, right? -What about me? -Did you say anything? No, it's your guts rumbling. Oh my! That will be quick! Where's my toilet? I haven't built my toilet yet! Quick! Hurry! I'm not gonna make it! Where to go? Not here! Not here! Alright, here it is. Look, the door holds. I'll add the latrine later. Would you like to relieve yourself too? But I wanted to show him... Oh, alright then. Now I have everything. Well, this requires an anthem. Little Man, Little Man he's doing great... Little Man, Little Man he's doing great... Living in his Hollow Hill... That doesn't rhyme! Living in his Hollow Hill... Well, I'll figure it out somehow. -Newspaper! -Thanks! Why do you ride such a powerful bike when just delivering newspaper? You see, you never know what you run into around here. Well, nothing to do with me. I don't have to go anywhere. Why don't you come over sometime? -I live just around the corner. -No, I prefer to stay at home. And make sure you don't crush my path too much when you leave. Oh well, I tried. So, what do The Burdock Leaves say today? How to learn to swim. Or here: How to work a compass when wandering in the countryside. I do have a compass, but what for? I don't need to go anywhere. I can find my way to the toilet even without a compass. What does it say here? A TV programme! I've got a much better one. Honestly, an awesome programme! The way it moves is amazing. Now a stove is on, now a table... So many nice smelling meals... Now a pantry... Sometimes it gets mysterious. So many delicacies can be hidden here. And this is the most beautiful programme. Long live Little Man who has all he needs. I'm looking forward to my morning catkins. Come. Here you'll find what you need. What was that? Ugh, good thing I'm at home. What a silly dream. I have all I need, don't I? Come on. I don't feel like going to the loo. The berries are too dry, berry-picking is such a bore... Nothing but noodles here. I don't feel like eating noodles. I have to fix the tap again. Do I really have all I need? Little Man he's doing great... What? What is this? Go away, mole! I won't let you burrow into my flowerbed! Get lost! Are you at home? Oh dear. Come. Here you'll find what you need. That's it. I've got a house. I've got flowers, I've got a toilet. I've got noodles. I've got water to drink when the tap's not clogged. A table, a chair, a TV set, I have everything in the world. I have all I need and that's that. Why don't I take a peek into that dream? Let them tell me what it is I need if they're so clever. You must come here for real. A dream doesn't count. I can't go on like this anymore. This doesn't count anymore. There is something I need, for sure. But what is it? I must find the talking house and see what I need. Otherwise I'll go mad! I have to go and see Empty Head. Nothing else can help me out. Oh my. Hello, Empty Head. I live just... nearby. I keep having this dream about a talking house where I should find what I need. Well, I think I have all I need, but the dream keeps bugging me and it does not want to reveal what it is I need. I have to find the house so I can get some sleep again. It's the same thing, over and over again. My head has grown heavy, it's like a stone, you see? I don't know. Oh yes, Little Man, you don't have to tell me about head issues. The sun has dried all my thoughts away. My throat is scorched, my tongue is tied. -How I wish I could get a drink. -Here! Here you are. -Ordinary water won't help me. -And what would you like to drink? Can you see the flying geese? Yep! They are heading to the lake. And there is an island. On the island you will find a well with sparkly water. It can untie every tongue and fill any head with sparkly ideas. Go there and get it for me. Then I might help you out. Couldn't you do it without the water? Either you bring the water, or the dream will worry you to death. Why don't you get it yourself, that sparkly, amazing water? I can see the journey will do you good. -Oh my! -Wait! What's the rush? You might find this useful. A nut? What could I use it for? Oh well, I could have seen it coming. If Empty Head was of any help it would surely be called Wise Head. The way home... And the way to the lake. Oh well. Let's go. How am I supposed to get there? I can't build a boat, I left my tools at home. That's too deep! And I can't swim... A flying machine! That might be it! But I don't have the tools on me. I know! I'll throw three pebbles into the water and if no idea comes up, I'll go home and get the tools. One... Right. Nothing. Two... Still nothing. -Three.... -Don't you dare! I've had enough of this racket! I'm sorry but... I need to get to the island. Forget it. I guard the place so that no one gets there. -What's that in your knapsack? -Well, catkins. Yuck, I don't eat cats' skins! No, those are birch catkins, really tasty. They have nothing in common with cats or skins. -Have you got enough of them? -A full knapsack. If you take me to the island I'll share them with you. We'll see if you've got enough. Hop on! I have so many we can ride around the lake all week. -So let me try that cat's skin! -Here. -Gimme more! -Here. -Enjoy. -Gimme more! Gimme more! Gimme more! I've just run out. You're a real glutton. Hey! I have no washing line to dry my clothes on! Boy! Hey, boy! Boy? Come on, boy! You almost drowned. I fished you out just in the nick of time! That Loch Ness monster ate all my food. -It didn't even thank me. -You mean Fishrew? She used to be quite different, too. All noble and powerful. -She's powerful all right. -Not anymore. She got tamed. I used to be different, too. I used to guard the spring, but now... I need some of the sparkly water. A few drops will do. The spring has been seized by Great Strait. Once she looks at you, you sink into such fear... You should run away from here. There's no way to get close to her. No way. I don't see why I shouldn't get a few drops if I ask for them politely. I want to be a well-slept Little Man once again. But Great Strait has a helper! This Cheeky Punk! I'm not sure if you'll deal with him. Well, I can do that. -Hello? -What are you here for? I need to talk to Great Strait. Now. We'll have to sort it out quickly then. Come on in. Who is howling so desperately in here? Is it Great Strait? You'll find out in a sec. Stand here, a bit to the right... Right, here we go! And it's done. -Hey, codger, have you got any fish? -Here, a fresh catch. Let me see. Give it to me. Keep everyone away from here! How many times do I have to tell you? And to that beast of yours as well! I'll explain to her myself that she mustn't bring anyone over here! You mouldy old codger! My lady, I've brought you fish. And fish bones, your favourite meal. -Won't I get a praline? -No. First run and check if the intruder has had enough. And bring me the bones of our darlings from the woods. They are my favourite! Sure, my lady. I will. Ouch, that was a proper punch. I'll fix your loaf, you Cheeky Punk! Off I go to the island. I'm gonna get the water... What's that? What's out there? Go away! Here, a twig! Here, a nut! What's just fallen out of it? There's so much space here! A larva. -What's your name, larva? -I don't know. Alright, I'll call you Feeda then. I am Little Man. I don't think it can see us. It can only hear us. -Let's test it! -Yeah! Hurry up! You can hide in here. You'll be safe in here. -Thank you! -Thanks! Get lost. That's enough. Atta boy. Something stinks here. Did you notice the person's shoes? -Red shoes, very elegant. -Exactly. Right, my lady likes her bones nicely roasted, maybe a tad burnt. -Oh my. It's him! -Who? -The Punk. -Give my regards to hell. What now? It's all over. Damn! Damn! -What about me? -What do I care? But I'll fry to death. -And I'll never know what I need! -Help! Be quiet, you're small enough to push through the window. But me? I'm not leaving without you. I won't let you down. Really? I'll call for help then. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! It's no use. We're goners. Hop on! How did you find us? You weren't at home so I asked around a little. I've got The Burdock Leaves for you. Yippee! Yippee! Faster! Faster! Right. You'll be safe here. Now I understand why you ride such a powerful bike. That's right. Why are you wandering around here anyway? It's nothing, I just wanted to get some fresh air. I can't sleep. Well, fresh air is the best remedy. When I have troubles sleeping, I go fishing. I catch three fish and I'm fine. You always have to find a way out when you fall too deep, right? -Well, good luck! Bye! -Bye! Excellent, you've done a good job. You'll get a praline. And now get lost. I'll take a bath in my miraculous water. And I might even have a sip of it! It makes me sleep well, you know. I'll wave off mosquitoes so they don't disturb you in your sleep, okay? No need, I'd rather not sleep anyway. Look, there's Orion in the sky. I can see it perfectly from my bench by the Hollow Hill. -Could you tell me a bedtime story? -What? Well, I've never actually... Alright then. Once upon a time, there was this young man, I mean a prince. His parents, I mean the king and the queen, sent him out into the world so he could learn how to look after himself. He had no supernatural powers, but he did have an interesting quality: He was really skilled. In everything he touched. And say, what did he touch? Let's say that during a long walk he thought: I have no place to stay! And this is a nice spot, so I'll build a house here. He had his own tools, he inherited them from his grandpa... And after a while he built a beautiful house. And one day he had to go to poo, so he used his luxurious toilet. Another day he found an unexploded firecracker. He would even get the newspaper delivered right on his doorstep. And so the prince lived a happy life and... And... Well. I'd better not sleep at all. I'd be rattling the door handle of the talking house anyway and the fury would wake me up. See? You can sleep! You've been asleep, right? -You don't get it -What? I suffer from this nightmare. And I can only get rid of it if I find the house from my dream which hides something I need. -But I don't know where it is. -That's bad. And neither does Empty Head. The Head would have to have a sip of some special crystal water, but the water is guarded by Strait. There's no way to get to the water. Does Strait wear those elegant shoes? No. That was her flunkey. Cheeky Punk! I must outsmart him! And go back to being the Little Man who has all he needs! Your life seems pretty complicated. But for me you're still the prince who can do anything. Listen, we have to go back to the island. But we'd better pass the forest. To the left, or to the right? To the left, or to the right? Firecrackers! -Crossroads. Which way to the lake? -What's on those sheets? Those are posters. They say: "Red and Black" Ants Show, Meeting of Woodskin Volunteers, Krumloch is... Eh! 5th Locust Rally "Eat What You Spot"... I'd go to the 5th Locust Rally and eat what I'd spot there. -What if you saw a hammer there? -I'd eat it. No way, I wouldn't drag you around with a hammer in your stomach. I like The Wisdom of the World Under One Roof. -Sure. -They might know the way to the lake, and perhaps even how to beat Great Strait. Yes! Visit our Bibliotheca, open daily, no fees. Bookwormow the Librarian. -That's what The Burdock Leaves said! -Really? Books give you the most useful advice. There was also a practical guide to leafing through a book. -People have lost this skill. -But how will we find it? Straight up north. HOW TO REACH US? We'll use a compass and a map, and look for the north. -Like this? -Not like this. Some other way. -We have to go... That way! -Wow! How did you do it? -It's not easy, but I know the ropes. -I knew you were a prince! Stop! Entry allowed in slippers only! Hello. I don't have any slippers, Mr Bookwormow. Take your shoes off then! Let me see your socks. They mustn't be striped. Stripes make me dizzy. Fortunately, I am wearing knitted deer socks. Come in then. I'm glad you're into books. -What is it you need? -How do we get to the lake? -No need for a book. Go that way. -Thank you! And is there a book that says how to outsmart flunkeys -and how to deal with Strait? -That's a tough one. The world is full of flunkeys. And as for Strait... That's why I'm here, safely tucked in a library. I don't need anyone and I don't need anything. -You don't need anything? -No, I have all the books here. Such silly questions. Wait, I have an old book here that says how to deal with straits. Take a seat, let me find the book. -Yeah. -Thank you. It would never occur to me we might get this lucky. Kant Immanuel... It must be somewhere higher. Potter Harry. Nah. A bit further up. Strait! Even Great Strait. Oh yes! Here it is! I'll be right back with you. But it's in mercurial writing, you can't read it with mere eyesight. I see. -That writing is weird, my eyes hurt. -They do, don't they? Fortunately, I can lend you these special piercing glasses here. -And where do you have the glasses? -On the armchair. What armchair? I guess you don't have another pair, do you? Wait, it will be easy-peasy. I'm really good at this stuff. But this is too hard for me. -Wait. I've got it. -What is it? Lend me the book for a while and I'll fix the glasses later. Hang on, these glasses can be fixed only by Small Handymen. On the crossroads turn to the left. I can't believe this... To the left. To Small Handymen. Yeah, right. I'm too busy for that. We'll go back to the lake, the same way we came here. Even through the dark woods. Those two bogies will be gone, right? You're going the wrong way. You'll never get to the Handymen! We're not going there anyway. We're heading back to the fortress! -You know how to defeat Strait? -No, but it's in the book. If I just show her the book and she'll fall to pieces. And if not, I'll beat her to death with it. -And her cheeky Red-shoe-man too. -Sure! "The library." Hush! Quiet! So the monsters cannot hear us! We're on the right track. This is your birthplace. -And you're my daddy! -No, I only got you in a nutshell. What am I going to look like when I grow up? Wow! Why is there so much water in one place here? Because this is a lake. And there's the fortress over there. -And how shall we get there? -Let's do it this way: I'll throw some pebbles in the lake to disturb Fishrew, I'll jump into the place where Fishrew sticks her head out, bounce and jump on the bank. My arms are strong enough to deal with the high wall. Then we'll quietly look around and find what we're looking for. With a bit of luck we'll get some sparkly water and avoid Great Strait. And how will we get away from the island? I'll have a sip of the water and I'll figure something out. Wow, you're really smart. Right. Here we go. Cool! It works! Fishrew is prep... What was that? Well... -Oy, codger, did you see anything? -No, sir. He's got some stamina. It's going well so far. -I'm hungry. -There's a camera! -Does it taste good? What? What is...? Good thing there was the net. What an awesome trampoline. This way! -That must be her. Great Strait! -Why is she crying? She must feel her end is nigh. Get ready for your end! This book says how you'll die, Great Strait! Read and die! But I am not Great Strait! I am Witch's Foot. What Witch's Foot? I don't want any Witch's Foot! Where is Strait? Up there, down there, she is everywhere. I howl here to scare away nosey-parkers. -You nosey-parker. -Come, Feeda, this is useless. Wait. Witch's Foot, there is another reason for your howling, right? No. -You howl because you're sad. -Right. -Because you're unhappy. -Right. Leave her, we have more important things to do. This is important. Why are you sad and why do you actually howl? I am ugly... hideous. And I am so alone! Well, once I find out what I need, I'll help you out. Alright then. -What's the bubbling sound? -Quiet! It must be the spring. Eat this! Right. Come on, mate. And you too. Let's play astronauts. When I shut this door, you'll take a small flight. And you dig your noses in the ground. -All the way up on the Moon. -You Punk! Right, let's go. Be quiet, Witch's Foot! You don't howl loud enough! Not only are you ugly and stupid, but you don't even howl loud enough! You won't amount to anything. Never! Even as a larva you never amounted to anything, you... You're a no-good guard, Cheeky Punk. You'll never amount to anything. You've been useless since you came here. I want peace and quiet here and that's your responsibility. That nuisance won't come back. No one ever will. I'll see to it, ma'am. You know what will happen if you mess it up once again! You'll end up in that tin in the yard if he ever comes back here. -I'm not very fond of visitors. -I'll go back to work, alright? No! You'll run to see if he's finally dead. I'd better leave my wig here. I don't want to play astronauts... But I have to. Hello, wakey-wakey! Get up! Come on! Don't sleep! You should whisper in my ear, not my nose. There! Come on. You've had a good sleep at least, right? No, I haven't slept at all. I was knocked out. If I had slept, I would have had that awful dream about the house. I can't remember anything. Look! It's Punk! How did he get here? Ouch! Ouch! Come here. Come on! He's a goner. Wait, I'll make a cross for you here. And rest in peace, Bucktooth. And now let's run to Small Handymen and have my glasses fixed, so I can read about how to fight Great Strait. Now you're going the right way. Down the yellow path. And take the ferry! Ouch! It hurts! My knees, my bum, my elbow, my spine... Aargh. -Why are we going downhill? -Because it's a downhill road. A bit further... Yes, yes, yes. "I'm in the post office" Wow, that was a proper punch. Wait, wait... Ah! I can see it now! So he didn't survive being shot out of a cannon. But what if it's a trap? If I survived that punch in my bum he might have as well. Didn't I just hear someone say: "Walk down the yellow path?" Which way? I can't even sit anymore. -What if the mark was blue? -Then we'd arrive somewhere else. -And what do you have legs for? -So I wasn't stuck in one place. -Why isn't everything in one place? -Because it wouldn't fit in there! -And why are we here of all places? -Because you ask stupid questions! Look! A ferry! Hello? Is anybody there? No, there isn't. This must be a self-service. How come the ship doesn't sink? Ships are made to float. -Not to sink. -I see. Gotcha! Sorry, but some ships are made to sink, not to float. -Look! -Listen, Feeda, I've had en... -Oh! Damn! -See? Right. And now... Oh! What now? -What now? -Wait! Wait! Hurry! Help! I'll try to clog it like this. -Better? -I can't hold it. Help me, Feeda. I got him! All the pralines I'll get! -I can't do it! Come here, Feeda! -No! Oh no! Not that! -So? How do you feel? -Good, but my bum is really cold. You're a legend! Just hold on. Wait, what? What? Sod it! They were supposed to drown! Bloody hell! Bloody hell! Oh well. Now which way to go... I knew I would find you here. Would you like some fish? Thanks Mr Postman! I'm as hungry as a wolf. -Have some, too. -I don't eat this. I'll have grass. Alright. -You can see everything in the fire. -True. That hit the spot. Thanks. Why don't you quit slogging and pop over for a visit? I still haven't found what I'm looking for. How far is it to the Small Handymen Co-Op? It's just over the hill. -Well, thanks for everything. -See you again sometime... Why don't he and the biker go to hell? I could have been at home by now and he doesn't let go. Small Handymen Co-Op. At last! Come on. Right. Great. This game must delight mainly... -What do you want? -Could you fix my piercing glasses? That's a job for Mr Small. Wait a sec. Here it is. Take the lift down. Right. And now you're trapped. Just you wait. I'll play with you a little. Not this. Neither this. We'll play a hedgehog. Yes, please? I am done for today, it is late. Drop by tomorrow. I need you to fix something, Mr Small. I shall finish this and go and watch the football. Go to sleep, come tomorrow. -I'd love to, but I can't. -He can sleep only when knocked out. I strongly claim that I've said it... Today... Only to fix something? Yes. I only want you to fix something. You should have said so. I thought you said: "Only to invent something." -No! -Yes, you did. -He didn't! -Yes, he did. -I heard him say... -No, invent... He said: "Fix!" -This is it! -I see. This is it. Piercing glasses. Model Peek-A-Two! Rare thing! What barbarian destroyed them like this? -Me. I sat on them by mistake. -Yes. I'll fix it in no time. Watch carefully. My latest patent. Observe. -See? -Wow! Neat little thing! -How does it work? -It's very simple. Observe. See? I was inventing a universal breaker which was not difficult. And when the breaker was finished, I tried to switch the reverse on. And see? It works. A universal fixer. I was happy. This is what I look like when I am happy. Anyway. The piercing juice leaked out of the glasses. Of course, I have the juice here because I have everything in here. I have all I need. Wait here. It was right here. Recently... -Let me help you out. -I understand you want to help. You are thoughtful, young man, but I'd better help myself. Where could I...? In the pantry, perhaps? See? See. ...and the ball is once again close to the goal... Hey! I have to get to the one who came here before me. -Pronto! -Pronto it is, then. Is this enough? Here you go. I hate to disturb. But now I'll make a hedgehog of you. How come? You were dead! I made a cross for you. -And now you're distracting us again. -He has spilled your juice. -I am getting upset. Pliers! -What? What is it? Let go! Let go! -I have to go back in there. -What? I must go back in there! Turn the volume down, codger. -Stand over there. -What? Damn. -Good. What a punk. Quick, Mr Small, grab another phial, so we can read the instructions in the book. We must get to the island before the flunkey does. -It was the last phial. I am sorry. -What? That baddie really pulled it off. -Now talk, Ms Smarty-Pants. -Well, I... Wait. What is the juice made of? My friend Livid grows special gherkins. This liquid is made of gherkin juice. The journey to Mr Livid is long and difficult. You cannot succeed. You really are smart! Which way? How do we get to your friend Livid? ...show you... look... see... We are here. You must get here. Over the hills... Wind, rain, mud... Feelings of frustration... You cannot succeed. I am sorry. -I can. -Wait... Take this portable universal fixer. You might find it handy. Now I wish you luck. This is how I wish luck. When I get... I mean, when we get the juice, we'll bring you some. A whole barrel! What is he doing? Watching football. And that's all he needs. Hello? Is anybody here? Stop yelling, or you'll scare... Stay where you are! You need something, right? Yes. Gherkin juice for piercing glasses. Sure. Hang on. Just a sec. You see, the sun burnt my face. It's really hot here, in the desert. I'll give you juice! This is what you get when you keep sticking your nose in things! -You won't find anything! -You wish! -Die, you midget! -Here, this is for that club! Ouch! Stop biting! -Here! For that luck of yours! -Here! For the sparkly water! You stole it and Empty Head can't help me and I have to trudge around and you keep spoiling everything. He's had enough. Aren't you Mr Livid, by the way? Oh, I see. It's me. And you need some gherkin juice for piercing glasses. -Am I right? -Yeah. How did you know? I'm glad I have someone to talk to, but could you put me down? -This is not a comfy position. -Sure, sorry. Let me help you. The moment he arrived, he tied me up and hung me by my feet. -What a punk! -You're alright now. Mr Livid, could we get a few drops of that gherkin juice from you? That's the problem. I don't have any juice now. Not even a gherkin. Because they only grow out of really fertile questions after you plant them in sand. Ask me a really fertile question and we're home and dry. It's easy! How do we beat Great Strait? How to make ugly beautiful? -And what is Krumloch? -Wait, I must write it down. It's not that simple. Great Strait... Make ugly beautiful... Krumloch... Let's try to plant them. Well, they weren't very fertile. No gherkins are growing. -So which are the fertile ones? -No one knows. -You must keep trying. -Why aren't the gherkins growing? Why did the Cheeky Punk have to break the only phial with the juice? Why was I so clumsy and sat on such important glasses? Why can't I scoop up some water from the well? Why can't I beat Great Strait? Why didn't Empty Head...? Look! Oh my! He's gone. Right, we'd better hurry up. Somewhere in a desert country there grows an Answertree. -Answertree? -It can answer all your questions. I myself don't know where it grows, because it is perfectly hidden... But nearby, by the erratic boulder, there live Searchmen. -Searchmen? -Nothing can hide from them. Give them a message from me and they'll show you the way. Hang on! If we found such a perfect tree, we could get all the answers there. Why didn't we go straight to the tree instead of trudging around? It could have told me what I need. And what is Krumloch and why you have feet? And I could get my sleep right away! And how would you have learnt about the tree if you hadn't come to me first? -That's true. -So take this and go. Alright. Thank you. Thanks for the message. And why does your nose look like a gherkin? -Stop it and let's go. -What have I done? Why does my nose look like a gherkin? Right. Let's see. Well, that was a fertile question. Right. Very good quality. Look, an arrow! We're on the right track. Yes! Follow the arrows and you'll reach your destination! Wow! That voice! It's like in a fairy-tale. When a ghost of a dead mother tells someone what to do. -Your mum died? Sorry about that. -No, Mum's alive. As well as my dad. -So what is this voice? -No. This is too suspicious. Let's take this stony path instead of the moss-grown one. Bloody hell! Sod it! You were supposed to go this way, step on this string, and become a skewered meat. Oh, that was close. But I'll get you! I have to destroy you before you find the tree! You tiny little midget! Oh my. Go away! Go! Oh no! I don't think you'll fall asleep this way, Feeda. There are so many... Could you shut your traps? We are having a ceremony here. I'm waving away mosquitoes so she can get some sleep. Listen, aren't you a Searchman? -I am. -I see. This is for you from Mr Livid. Alright, but be quiet. They call these fireworks? I'd show them fireworks... Ha! He shall find what he seeketh! I'll get it for him, he's fallen asleep. Thank you! You won't find anything! There's nothing for you to find! You're searching in vain! You're searching in vain! -You won't find anything! -I can't go on like this anymore! -What was that? What was that? -Here is the way to the tree. Read it, I can't read yet. -You'll see a tiny plane circle... -Come here! No! Feeda! Well, this is... You Punk! Damn! Move away, you... Ouch! Let me tell you something. Do you know what silly men swallow? -No, no... -A bait. And do you know what I'll make Little Man swallow? Yuck, your breath stinks. -Help! -What a stench! -Help! -Where have they gone? Feeda! Feeda! Where are they? I don't care about the spring. I don't care about Strait and that sparkly water. Nor about Empty Head. Feeda! Feeda! Feeda! Feeda, darling! Here you are! Feeda! I'm coming! -I'm coming, Feeda darling. -Run away, quick! It's a trap! I'm not leaving without you. I won't let you down. What is it? I knew you would swallow my bait. Because you're just a dummy who keeps saving everyone around and making things hard for me. I'll blow you two into pieces until nothing is left of you. Don't look, don't look! What? What's that? You'll see a tiny plane circle... What plane circle? Where? Wait! Over there! Hang on. Right. And it's done. Circling is over. You shouldn't have done that. The plane was a sign. -We're getting close. Must dash! -Wait! I'll turn the tank around! How does it...? What? Go! No! Not there! Oh no! How will I make my living? My tiny plane! My everything! -Good day! -Hi. You'd better step aside. -See? There you go. -Good. I could have fixed it myself, even better perhaps. Go away. -I don't need anyone. -But your plane was circling. That's a clear sign that the tree must be somewhere nearby. The tree? That's your business. I don't need any trees. That's what I thought as well. And here I am! And it was a good thought. I have all I need. Go away. But the tree is important! Go, I say! -What is this? -The tree! What? Yes, that's a tree. You can't see it from the ground but when I fly up, it's completely... Completely... -Hidden! -Yes, hidden. It's over there. Now you know it, so go away. -He is so lonely. -And he's not even aware of it. It's quiet here at last. Feeda! We did it! I'm kind of sleepy. Now we'll just ask questions and learn everything. Feeda! Feeda! Feeda? Feeda, wake up! This shouldn't have happened. You were supposed to survive. Because the prince was skilled and figured it all out and wanted to go back home and show you his little house... And now you're dead instead. Why? The larva is not dead. It has pupated and now it is turning into a butterfly. What? A butterfly? Feeda? But... I'm sorry for freaking you out. But I myself had no idea either. -And how are you feeling? -Wonderful. It's just... It's just that I've become a boy. Never mind! The important thing is that you're not... That you're here! I'm so happy! And I'm going to call you Feedafly! Ok, then. Let's ask questions. -What is Krumloch? -A crooked hole. Why did Little Man sit down and crush the piercing glasses? Because he sat on them. -How do you make ugly beautiful? -When you give it a beautiful name. And how do I beat Great Strait? When you see what she really looks like. -Is this what the book says? -Exactly. And how will I see what she really looks like? Through the piercing glasses. -Who will give me gherkin juice? -Master Livid. -Does he have the juice now? -He does! -Where do I find the talking house? -Empty Head will tell you! LIVID'S TOP HIT! Now I'll read how to sort Strait out, we'll fill a bottle with the water... -What's wrong with you? -Behind you... -What? -Here you are. Come to me if you want to compete. You have no idea who Great Strait is. Those who look at me surrender to a horrible fear. They become powerless and totally dependent on my will. It's showdown time, you hero! We'll see! No! No! -No! -Suddenly you've run out of words! Do you still want to fight me? I could trample you down like a worm. But that would be way too merciful. You'll serve me instead of Cheeky Punk! And I'll put that butterfly of yours to Witch's Foot! And I'll call you Little Punk. -How do you like that? -I like that... -I'll show you! -Now get up and come serve me. First you'll sweep the whole yard so... So I can see if you can sweep the whole yard. Move it, Little Punk! Grab a broom and sweep! Just make sure it's not too dusty. Dust... What are you doing here? I don't want you this close. This place is mine only. I hate visitors, I want to be alone in here. Me, myself and only me! Don't you dare touch the tap... Are you crazy? You know how lovely it is to have all you need! When no one bothers you, no one touches your stuff... Alright, we'll make a deal. I like making deals. With you. You're more skilled than I thought. Pour some fresh water on me... We'll be together here. In the tub. You'll have all you need in this fortress. All you need! Just please, pour some water on me! I don't want to! -And now I have the sparkly water. -Hey! I'm still here! I'm the lord of the island now! And the two of you... Serves him right. You forgot about me, didn't you? Thanks, Witch's Foot! You'll be beautiful! Ugly gets beautiful when called a beautiful name. -From now on you'll be called Daisy. -Me? You're beautiful! You have done a great thing. I must admit I didn't really trust you. -Well, I wouldn't succeed on my own. -Good luck, Little Man. Good luck to you, too. Hello, Empty Head. I've got the sparkly water. Tasty water... So tasty! Pour some more on me. I have not felt this awesome for ages. I should have remembered earlier! That talking house of yours is just a few steps from here. -Is it? -Sometimes you have to walk for miles in order to find what is right under your nose. Hurry up, just run over that hill and you're there. Stop it, I'm ticklish! -Go on. -Thank you! Hi! Come on in! I'm Beefheart but my friends call me Captain. Hi! I'm Little Man, Captain... Beefheart. I've never heard a sillier name. -Hey, aren't you the postman? -Sure I am. That quest took you pretty long. But don't worry, others search even longer. And sometimes they don't even find anything. What have you found? Well, it's kind of funny... But all that time I was actually looking for this house of yours. Sure. And I was supposed to find all I need here. And I've found you, my friend. -That's really cool. -It is, isn't it? Listen, do you play any musical instruments? -Well, I play the guitar a bit. -Great. Try this one, will you? Sounds good. We might throw a party to celebrate our friendship. We'll invite people... What do you think? Alright... But you can burrow only here, okay? Nice mechanical arm, really. Sure, and check out the eyes. Observe. Beautiful place you've got, son. I can see you have all you need. I can't see a lawn mower. I borrow it from a friend. Is that right, my friend? Yes. Thank you for the invitation. I live just across the hill. I've baked some pastries. Would you like some? -What's your name? -Marjorie. That's a really nice name. But it is nice, isn't it? -Well, cheers. -Cheers! And can I set it off now?
