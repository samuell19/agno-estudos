Come on. Get ready. We've reached Dalhousie. Gather your luggage. Don't forget anything behind. Don't be lazy. Come on, hurry up. Alight fast. Hurry up. Come on, girls. Make it fast! Come on, girls. Don't make noise. Hurry up. Where is Raju, the guide? I wonder where he's disappeared. Hello. Hello! Excuse me. - What is it, ma'am? Hey, mister? Who is Raju, the guide, here? Raju is sitting right before you. Very good morning, ma'am. Now I'm standing. Everybody is waiting for you at the station and you are sitting here! Come on, hurry up! Ma'am, this is the station. The train stopped ahead. It didn't stop near me. - Idiot! Stop, Stop. Stop here. Stop, driver. Pay attention. The bus will halt here only for ten minutes. Whoever wants to refresh themselves, can do so. Don't tell me later that you weren't given time. I will go and fill water. Liquor here is so expensive, it makes no sense coming here! What the hell are you doing in the middle of the road? Are you blind? Who would have paid had the bottle broke? Your father? Suraj, where had you been? I didn't see you for two days. Where were you? Since two days? You are strange! - Why? You were lying intoxicated at the bar yesterday. I had to carry you home. Was it you who took me home? - Who else? I was wondering why he looked familiar. You have carried me home several times before. Don't worry, I am fine now. You look fine. Have you found a big client? A group of girls have come from Mumbai. I have got the contract to show them around. By the way, where are you going? I was going to the city but my bike broke down. I don't know what's wrong with it. I can't figure it out. - I am showing the girls around. I will take them to a place which will make them insane. They will always remember me.. - Raju, hurry up! We're getting late. - I'm coming.. I'll take your leave. Bye! - We'll meet again. Come on. Get in everybody.. - Get in. Let's go. Has everyone come? Let's go. Come on, move.. Stop the bus! Stop the bus! Well! She has missed the bus. - Stop the bus! Oh! Hey! - Stop the bus! Okay, driver. Let's get going. - Stop! Please stop the bus! Stop the bus! Stop the bus! Please.. Hey.. - Please stop that bus.. Help me! I am from Mumbai. - Ma'am, I'd like to help you.. but my bike.. - Or else, I can't return home. Please stop that bus.. - My bike broke down. Please stop that bus. Stop that bus somehow. Do you want to catch the bus? - Do anything! Right now? - Yes! Are you sure? - Yes! All right! Don't say that I didn't warn you. Fine! - Come on, let's go. Help me! Help! I don't want to catch the bus. Help! Is anyone there! Help me! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Help! Help! Save me! Stop it. Here comes the bus. Kiran, where were you? Let's go. "I am a crazy boy." "You are a fairy in a girl's form." "I am a crazy boy." "You are a fairy in a girl's form." "Ever since I met you.." "there's something magical all around." "I am slipping out of control." "A new season has begun." "I am a crazy boy." "You are a fairy in a girl's form." "Ever since I met you.." "there's something magical all around." "I am slipping out of control." "A new season has begun." "There's something magical all around." "There's something magical all around." "There's something magical all around." "There's something magical all around." "What is this feeling?" "What is this thirst?" "Sweetheart, please tell me." "Please don't make me anxious." "What is this feeling? What is this thirst?" "Sweetheart, please tell me." "Please don't make me anxious." "Your hair reminds me of rain." "You have a unique charm." "Your cheeks are vibrant." "I am a crazy boy." "You are a fairy in a girl's form." "You struck me with affection, you have made me restless." "Your eager gaze.." "These charms of yours will take my breath away." "You struck me with affection, you have made me restless." "Your eager gaze.." "These charms of yours will take my breath away." "Your breaths are fragrant, there's desire in your eyes." "There's fun in your talk." "I am a crazy boy." "You are a fairy in a girl's form." "Ever since I met you.." "there's something magical all around." "I am slipping out of control." "A new season has begun." "There's something magical all around." "There's something magical all around." "There's something magical all around." "There's something magical all around.." "There's something magical all around." "There's something magical all around.." This is not Niagara falls. This is much more beautiful. Come on, hurry up. Ascend quickly and descend quicker! Go on. Climb faster. Hey, mister. - What is it? Where are you taking the girls? Ma'am, that's a popular place. It's called 'Stumble Here' falls. - What a weird name! Look. She stumbled. - Oh, my God! She.. That's why it's called 'Stumble Here' falls! Idiot! You've no clue where you're taking us. Come on, girls. We see around by ourselves. Idiot! Stupid! - This is a nice place. Shut up! Kiran, where are you going? - I'm coming. Wait for a while. I'll be back in a jiffy. Hello. Are you all right? I hope you didn't miss the bus. If you missed it, I'm happy to help. No. Your style of helping is unique. Thanks. Why're you thanking me? I enjoyed it. By the way, this place is very beautiful. - Yes, that's true. I call it heaven. But the guide, Raju, doesn't do his job properly. Why are you blaming him? The poor guy does it for a living. I can take you around this place if you wish to explore it. Why? Are you a guide? No. I'm not a guide but I know this place well. Oh! - I'll show you from my perspective. What are you going to show me? The temple of the Goddess is very beautiful. Would you like to see that - Sure, why not? Let's go. Not today. Do you see that mountain? - Yes. The temple is located in the valley behind that mountain. It's a day's journey. If you wish to see.. Shall we go tomorrow? If you are free. What.. What am I doing tomorrow? Yes, I am free. Be ready at 5:30 a.m. - Okay. By the way, I am Suraj. Kiran. - Kiran? When did you come? - I came just now. I was ready before time. I thought of waiting outside for you. Shall we go? - Let's go. Suraj, this is a dangerous place. - Are you scared? No, I am not! I never get scared. You are indeed lucky that you have been blessed to live in such a lovely place. Yes, I have been blessed. - Isn't it? You look very happy. - I am happy. Aren't you happy? Oh! - I am happier.. What happened to you? You said that you don't get scared. What? Okay. I'm sorry.. Kiran. Hey, look at that. Bungee jumping. You played a prank! Don't you feel ashamed to play such a prank? I don't want to go anywhere with you. Kiran, don't you want to see the temple? No, I don't want to. - Okay, I am going. This is for you. Do you know what I wished for? - Don't tell me. There is a belief here that if you reveal your wish it will never be fulfilled. - Oh! What are you thinking? - Just that what you might have wished for. Not to take back what He's given me. - Really? But you revealed what you asked for. This is not my wish, it's my ardent prayer. Then what was that which I asked for? A wish? Suraj, wait. Suraj.. Thanks, Kiran. Take back your jacket. Keep it. You've to go home. You will feel cold. Okay, I am going. What is the hurry? Have a cup of coffee. Coffee? Actually, it is late. My family must be worried. Some other time. Who knows if we meet again? We are leaving tomorrow early in the morning. You are leaving and you didn't inform me. It hurts to talk about departing, doesn't it? Then, why did you tell me now? Because I want to meet you before I leave. Let's have coffee now. Where were you? - Where are mom and dad? Have dinner. It must've got cold by now. Dad, I had been to the temple of the Goddess. Go anywhere. Did we ever stop you? We are occupied with work all day long. I just want the entire family to at least have dinner together and share our feelings. I'm sorry Dad. Do you have any idea how worried your mother was? You could have informed us. You could have called to inform us that you'd be late so that we wouldn't worry. You had gone out in the morning. Look what time it is now. We were bothered with thoughts. I'm really sorry, Dad. It won't happen again. Fine. Go and eat. You join me too. - I've already eaten. I know that nobody has eaten. Please Dad. All right. Let's go. Suraj! Suraj! Suraj.. Get up! Mom, what happened? Father! - Your father is not feeling well. Come quickly! Dad! Dad, what happened? I don't know. - Dad.. - Dad! Asha, call the doctor. Hurry! - You'll be all right. Dad. Mom, don't worry. - Suraj, do something. Let's take him to the hospital. Dad, come on. - Be careful. "Crazy.." Come on, hurry up. Is everyone here? Come on. Kiran, that includes you too. We're getting late. "Crazy.. - Crazy.." Kiran, we're getting late. The train will depart soon. Come on, Kiran. "What drives us insane?" You can see him now. - Thank you, Doctor. "Those who love would know.." "Love.." "Those who fall in love would know what drives people insane.." "The entire world is crazy in love.." "The entire world is crazy in love.." "What drives people insane.. - Insane.." "Those who love would know.. - They would know.." "Crazy.." "They left.." - Mr. Raju, come with me. Please come with me. Come on. - Hey, my bottle! Stop it. Why don't you understand? Listen to me. If those girls had stayed in a hotel then, I could've got the address from the hotel manager. But they stayed in a private bungalow. How can I get their address now? - Why not? The manager or owner of the bungalow might know it. This is weird. You don't understand. The owner lives in America and the keys are with someone who lives in Mumbai. When people come here to stay he sends the keys along with them and asks them to bring back the keys. What about the servants? - You are saying the same thing! Why don't you understand? The servants come with the party and return with them. Tell me what I should do? - Shit! Where have you brought me now? Wait! Suraj! What is it? - Suraj, you don't understand. You are handsome and smart. You have no dearth of girls. You can get any number of girls. Look at this.. Do you know what this is? A group of 50 girls are arriving from Delhi this evening. This is the list containing their names. It also includes their address and pin code. I'll give it to you. Hit on anyone you please! I'll make a declaration to you. I swear on God and promise you that henceforth, no girl shall leave Dalhousie without informing me. Have a look. Damn it! What I have done? I should quit drinking. Shit! It's Kiran's letter. No! Sorry friend, it flew away. "Somebody steals our heart stealthily." "Somebody steals our heart stealthily. - Somebody exists.." "who commands our senses." "What is lighter than dew? - It's love.." "What is thicker than any colour? - It's love.." "What is a divine nectar? - It's love.." "What is poisonous? - It's love.." "The words of a saint.. - Is love.." "The holy water.. - Is love.." "This insanity is the most pure.. - It is the most pure." "This insanity! - Insanity.." "Love! - This insanity!" "What is insanity.. - It's love.." Suraj! Suraj, come upstairs. - Yes? Dad is calling you. - I'm coming. Dad, did you call me? - Yes son, come, sit. Have tea. Son.. - Yes? I have received a transfer order. I have to choose between Delhi or Mumbai. A group of girls have come from Mumbai. Mumbai. - Why Mumbai? Why not Delhi? We have many relatives in Delhi. The groom we have chosen for Asha also lives in Delhi. Thus, Asha won't be far away from us. It's important to maintain a healthy distance in order to preserve relationships. Son, tell me, why do you want to go to Mumbai? I will get admission in a college in Mumbai. It will be good for my career. Why didn't you tell us that before? I'd have got you admitted there last year itself. You are aware that I cannot live without you. Do whatever you deem right. Is that so? We will go to Mumbai. You are a fresher, aren't you? - Yes. This is your first day in college. - Yes. You will have to do what we say. Isn't that right, guys? - Right! You can escape us but how will you escape these girls? You will have to come to us. What do you say? Oh! Fresher! - Look at him! Please. Please. I beg you. Hey, what are you doing? Don't do this. Fresher.. - Let me go. What's this? Fresher.. Fresher.. Fresher.. Fresher.. What do you want? Just put the ball in the basket and leave. Billy, pass the ball. Billly, pass here.. Come on. Pass it. Billy, take possession! What're you doing? Surround him. Get up, boy! Get up! Fresher! Fresher! Fresher.. The rookie is down! Will you play against us? - Come on, boy! Come.. Come on. Over here. Tackle. Block him. He is a novice! Fresher! Fresher! Fresher.. Get up! Get up! Come on, man! Come on! Get up, boy! Fresher! Fresher! Fresher.. Time out. Time out. Just a minute. - Time out, boys! Oh! Look at that! - He'll play.. Come on, kid.. Grab it! Grab it, quick! Everybody, rush to the backcourt! Oh, Lord! How did he do that? He packs a punch! - Yes.. Hey, dude! Come on! Why are you annoyed? All this was just a joke. Even we had been through all this. I.. I had even broken my leg. This so-called tough guy was hospitalised for a month. But we are all good friends today. - Yes! - Right, dude! Will you be our friend? Come on! - Hey, come on! I told you, we are friends. - Come on! - Rock. - Billy. - Diana. - Neel. - Ronnie. - Sam. Suraj. "Friends, we have to make it big, and work hard to make it happen." "Friends, we have to make it big, and work hard to make it happen." "We are here to study, our thoughts are fresh." "There is no other college like this one." "Friends, we have to make it big, and work hard to make it happen." "We are here to study." "Our thoughts are fresh." "There is no other college like this one." "Both History and Geography are deceptive." "We mug up all night and go blank by daybreak." "Wonder why this professor is mad at us." "We bunked his class, it was our fault." "We are aware.. - We are aware.." "that he will punish us." "Friends, we have to make it big." "We've to work hard to make it happen." "Friends, we have to make it big, and work hard to make it happen." "The ball is over the basket, plan the next move.." "It's a tough situation, please help us!" "Friends, I don't know what's happening here." "You have no idea of my dilemma." "Friends, I don't know what's happening here." "You have no idea of my dilemma." "The jester is upset, somebody cheer him up." "Lovebirds meet up here.. - Lovebirds meet up here.." "Friends, everyone has found their soulmate." "Friends, we have to make it big, and work hard to make it happen." "Friends, we have to make it big, and work hard to make it happen." "We are here to study, our thoughts are fresh." "There is no other college like this one." Hey, he is still at home. Suraj! - Hey, Suraj! Suraj! - Suraj! Hey! You aren't ready yet. The team selection is on and you're still here. Come on, get ready! - Come on. - Where are Sam and Billy? We've to pick them up on our way. At least you come down. You proceed! I'll be there. Hurry up. I will wait for you. Be there on time. Yes, you proceed! I'm coming. Everybody here, please! All of you assemble here. Who is in the shower? Come out quickly. The team for this year has been selected. Is everybody here? All right. Here is the team. Rohit Agarwal. - Yes, sir. Ronnie D'Souza. - Yes! Suraj Saxena. - Yeah! Asif Ali. - Yes. Balwinder Singh Sabharwal. - Yes! Amar Shah. - Sir! Aurobindo. - Yes! Ravi Kumar, Subrato Roy.. - Yes! Subodh Shetty, Paramjeet Singh.. - Yeah! Babbi, Raja Bajpai. - Yes. Jaswinder Singh. - Okay! and Sameer Rane. Yeah! Bravo! - Come on! I knew that we'd all be selected back when we played the match. Suraj, you pass really well. Simply great. - It was nothing.. That was no ordinary feat! - There he goes again! If he hadn't done it, we wouldn't have been in the team. That was a great pass, Suraj. - Yes, dude. You turned out to be a true friend. Thanks, buddy. - Hey. No formalities in friendship. - Sorry, dude. Hey, no apologies either. Friends, we need to celebrate tonight. Wow! Splendid! Food is true love! Waiter.. - Yes, ma'am? What's available in this restaurant? Ma'am, there are plenty of dishes available. I will read out the menu. One tight slap from the right hand. A fast punch and a freestyle kick. Wow! Hey.. Hey, Sam! - Wow! You always recite poetry. Recite something for that person. Please recite something. - Well. - Wow! Not an ordinary poem, I'll recite an emotional couplet. Look there, the sky is kissing the earth. and the earth is feeling euphoric looking at the sky. Thank you, I'm elated! - Wow! Splendid.. I didn't have any other way to find out about you. Dad got transferred to Mumbai. I was sure that I'd meet you here. After you left Dalhousie I felt a kind of emptiness in my life. I kept looking for you in the places where we had spent wonderful moments together. I always felt your presence around me. You had become my life's mission and my goal. I had so much to tell you when you were not around. And now that you are here.. I love you, Kiran. I love you very much. What do you know about me, Suraj? Who am I? What kind of a person am I? Which family I belong to? You know nothing. You are making a decision without knowing me and without applying a thought. I have not made a decision but loved somebody, Kiran. If you think, I don't deserve your love.. I don't have the courage to hear in the negative. If you wish.. "The entire world is crazy in love.." "The entire world is crazy in love.." "What drives people insane? Insane! - Insane.." "Those who fall in love would know.. - They'd know.." "Crazy.." "A lot is said without words." "This saga.." "is told through the eyes." "The union of hearts.. - It's love.." "The blooming flowers.. - It's love.." "The waves at the shore.. - It's love.." "A silent prayer.. - It's love.." "The various forms of Goddesses.. - It's love.." "The heartbeats.. - It's love.." "This insanity.. - This insanity.." "Insanity.." "This insanity is love.." Let's have it on the 18th of this month. - Surely. Please have something. You didn't have anything. You don't have to be formal. We have stayed long enough. We must leave now. Wait for some time, Suraj must be on his way home. God bless you. There! Suraj is here. Where are you going? Please sit down. You made us wait for so long. Sorry sir, I was held up in college. It's all right, dear. All formalities related to the wedding has been finalised. The wedding will take place on the 18th of this month. Asha will move with us to Delhi. That's great news. Please have a seat. No, we will leave now. It is late already. We came from Delhi today and are leaving tomorrow. We've to meet our relatives here or they will feel offended. We'll leave now. - All right. Please come.. Congratulations! It's empty. You're not yet married, and you are already annoyed with me. Where were you until now? Dad had told you that we were expecting guests today. Sorry. - Stop grinning or else, I will knock your teeth out! But I am very happy today. - Why are you happy? Why I am happy? Because you are getting married. You will finally leave this house forever. Then, there will be peace in this house and we will be able to breathe easy. - What! What did you say? How dare you! Come on.. What did you say? What did you say? Come here.. Hey! Hey! Come here, Asha. You are old enough to get married. What can I do? You don't need to butter me. Okay. Will there be peace at home after I leave? - Yes. All right. I will leave and will never come again. Do you feel like crying? Then, cry. Okay, hit me. Did it hurt? - I will not tell you anything. Were you going to tell me something? - Yes. Okay, tell me. - No. Tell me. - No. Please. Please, tell me.. - No. No. Okay you can hit me. I'm in love, Asha! I'm in love! You know something, Suraj. I had even made dad run like this in my childhood. Dad is so lovable. And your mummy? - She is no more. I just regret that I couldn't spend much time with her. I'm sorry. But Dad filled that void. He cares for me a lot. Tell me, when're you visiting my place? Asha wants to meet you. - Whenever you say On Asha's engagement day. Asha says that until she sees she will not get married unless she sees her brother's bride-to-be. She wants to see your face first on that day. Is that so? In that case, I will definitely come. Now tell me how much you love me. Quite enough. I love you a lot. "I swing in the garden.." - Present the ring. "The nightingale sings in my courtyard.." - Here you go, dear. "praising my beloved." Splendid! - "The nightingale sings.." "I swing in the garden.." Where is Kiran? - Be patient. She'll be here. "I swing in the garden.." "The nightingale sings in my courtyard.." "praising my beloved." "The nightingale sings my beloved's praises." "I swing in the garden.." - She is Suraj's girlfriend, Kiran. "I swing in the garden.." "The nightingale sings in my courtyard.." "praising my beloved." "The nightingale sings my beloved's praises." "I swing in the garden.." "The henna of fortune is applied.." "The henna of fortune is applied.." "Girls, beat the drum and dance to the rhythm." "The girl's parents dance." "The girl's brother dances." "Girl, we dance to the 'Bhangra'.." "Girl, we dance to the 'Bhangra'.." "Boy, we dance to the 'Giddha'.." "Boy, we dance to the 'Giddha'.." "Girl, show me the way you dance. - Oh, beautiful girl.." "Girl, let our eyes meet. - Oh, beautiful girl.." "Girl, show me the way you dance, let our eyes meet." "Girl, please dance with me, it's my sister's wedding." "Boy, don't come near me. - Oh, boy.." "Boy, don't cross my path. - Oh, boy.." "Boy, don't come near me, don't cross my path." "Get rid of this insanity, don't let it go out of control." "I will dance.. - I will dance.." "I will dance with joy.. - Let's dance." "My heart jumps with joy, I'll touch the sky." "I will dance.. - I will dance!" "You are shiny as a diamond, your beauty is like gold." "Your beauty is like gold.." "Dear, never lose this wealth of beauty." "Dear, never lose it.." "Go, get lost, don't resort to flattery." "Go, find someone else to be your partner." "Girl, don't show such attitude. - Oh, girl.." "Girl, don't frown too much. - Oh, girl.." "Girl, don't show such attitude. don't frown too much." "Girl, please dance with me, it's my sister's wedding." "You have grown up.." "but you're still immature. - He is still immature." "I feel that your brother is a womaniser." "She feels that." "How long will you stay single?" "Marry me quickly, the time is right." "Boy, make me your bride. - Oh, boy.." "Boy, I'll take the wedding vows with you. - Oh, boy.." "Boy, make her your bride, take the wedding vows." "If you want to get married, dress up in the wedding attire." "Dance.." "Girl, show me the way you dance, let our eyes meet." "Girl, please dance with me, it's my sister's wedding." "My sister mounted the palanquin." "She left for her husband's place." "Today, she has left.." "her father's house." "Now, she is no longer ours." "The one who played with us until yesterday." Come Son, let's go upstairs. - You go ahead. I'll come. Suraj, are you all right? Please leave me alone. Go with him. Halt! Come! - Put him in the car.. Go! What is going on.. Why have you brought me here forcibly? To introduce you to all these people. He is Mr. SK Khanna, the renowned businessman of this city. He can buy or sell anything. Do you know him? He is Mr. Kelkar, the municipal commissioner. The city's water supply can be shut down on his word. People will not get even a drop of water. He is Mr. Raut, the police commissioner. He can order anyone out of the city or put any one behind bars. And he.. He can make or mar anybody if he makes up his mind. He is Mr. Patil, the home minister. He is Mr. Gokhale, a renowned lawyer of the city. He doesn't take long to present true as untrue and vice versa. And he is the chief minister of our state. He's a distinguished personality. People don't dare to stand up to him. I need not say more about him. Whatever you told me was also not necessary. Why have I been forcibly brought here? So that you may realise your inconsequence and our high status. Do you know who Choudhary is? - Who Choudhary? Choudhary Ranvir Singh. Greetings, Mr. Choudhary. - Greetings, Mr. CM. Greetings. - Greetings. He is Suraj Saxena. Mr. CM, you commence the meeting. Mr. Choudhary will be back. Let's proceed. What is your relationship with Kiran? My relationship with Kiran? That is a personal matter. When other names get connected to my name the matter does not remain their personal matter but becomes my personal matter. Because Kiran is the only child of Ranvir Choudhary. I didn't know that Kiran was your daughter. - Stay there! Actually, Mr. Choudhary.. Kiran and I.. If you want to live, leave this city. You can be killed for the mistake you have done. I know ruffians like you very well. You've trapped an innocent girl from a rich family eyeing her wealth. People like you play games in the name of love. Mr. Choudhary, love isn't a game. It's a bond between two hearts. - Shut up! Leave the city, or else, I'll make your life miserable. Why just the city? I am ready to leave even this world if Kiran says so. Stop your nonsense! - No. I give a month's time. If I catch you in this city after 30 days, then you alone will be responsible for what you and your family suffer. You alone! I have seen how powerful you are. I have heard your threats. I've understood your status and your intentions. Thirty days? You will yourself hand me your daughter in 30 days. I promise you that. - Shut up! You must have heard of love but must not be aware of how undaunted it is. Love rules the heart, not power or status. You are very foolish. You have no idea what I can do. Consider yourself fortunate that I have given you 30 days' time. Thirty days? Fine. Thirty days it is. Love is strange. The more I meet you the more I feel far away from you. Love is like that. When the heart says something the brain is not ready to accept and when the brain says something you fear a heartbreak. - What? Hey. - Mom and Asha like you very much. Really? What else did they tell you? Nothing. - Nothing? They like what I like. Their happiness lies in mine. Are you happy? - Come here. You know something, Kiran.. My life has become beautiful ever since you came in. Whenever you meet me, I am lost in your sweet talks. Really? I love you. Do you know something? - What? You and my father are alike. I don't understand. You both love me more than yourself. Dad even fears the thought of my marriage. Why? Because I'd leave him and go away after marriage. But one day, you have to.. - I know.. I have to get married and go away. I am his lifeline. - And mine too. Come, I will take you to meet my dad today. Today? Not today, some other time. I find him worried these days. It is strange. I see the same expression on your face that I see on his. The two of you are truly alike. Well Kiran, you have put yourself in a problem. Why? - What will you do with two men who have the same traits? It's simple! I will love them both whole-heartedly. Isn't that right? I love you. - I love you, Kiran. I love you. "Yes, my insanity.. - Insanity.." "has been of some use. - Insanity.." "Yes, my insanity has been of some use." "Yes, my insanity has been of some use." "At least you've uttered my name." "You've uttered my name." "Yes, my insanity has been of some use." "Yes, my insanity has been of some use." "At least you've uttered my name." "You've uttered my name." "My heartfelt prayers were answered for you.." "I swear on you, I gave you my heart." "I was restless for years." "I had not a moment's peace." "I yearned for you, I found you. - I loved you." "Yes, my insanity has been of some use. - Insanity." "Yes, my insanity has been of some use. - Insanity." "Insanity.." "Tell me, why is your love intoxicating.." "You've cast a spell on me, I began to stumble." "Come closer, I'll hold you in my arms." "Let me taste your wine-like lips." "A new anxiety, a new found joy. - A new romance." "Yes, my insanity has been of some use. - Insanity." "Yes, my insanity has been of some use. - Insanity." "At least you've uttered my name." "You've uttered my name." Shankar, is the tea ready? Go inside. - Yes, it's ready. Okay. Kiran had gone to meet Suraj again today. I don't think he has any intention to leave the city. I don't care about that boy. I just have to free my daughter off his clutches. Deshpande, create such a situation that he is forced to leave the city. Here you go, ma'am. - Give me a kilo of cabbage. How much do the lady fingers cost? - Rs. 20 a kilo. Give me a kilo. - Sure. Here is Rs. 20. - It'll cost you Rs. 200 a kilo. No, it costs Rs. 20 a kilo. Isn't that so? Ma'am, I made a mistake. The cost of lady finger has risen to Rs. 200 a kilo. Are you crazy? You just said that it costs Rs. 20 a kilo. Now you tell me it costs Rs. 200. Don't you feel ashamed? How much for the cabbage? - Rs. 400 a kilo. You shut up! Who asked you? Why are you interfering? My job in this city is to ensure that whatever you purchase should cost at least 10 times more. Fine, I will buy from another shop. Go to any shop you like. Go to any shop in this city. The cost will go on increasing by Rs. 200. Mumbai is an expensive city, ma'am. If you want things for cheap then, leave this city. Mr. Choudhary will send you ration not just cheap, but for free. Mr. Choudhary? What do you mean? Ask your son, Suraj, who Mr. Choudhary is. With Suraj? Rock, I am telling you. Do you know what our families are saying? That there is no need to go to college. What could be the problem between Suraj and Choudhary? Whatever it may be, Suraj is our friend. If anyone dares to touch him, we will deal with him. Ronnie, use your brains, not your heart. Rock, who can dare to mess with Ranvir Choudhary? Rock, why don't you say something? That's enough! I've heard enough from you all! You all have spoken enough! I am sick of hearing your nonsense for so long. Don't come with me if you don't want to. I will go to my friend. Rock.. - You call yourselves friends? I will go. I definitely will! Here you go, sir. We have reached. How much? Hey! - Fourteen.. Hey! Who are you? What is this? Keep it. - Thank you. Who are you? My money! - Go.. What is the meaning of this? - Quiet. Who are you? What is going on? I am your well-wisher. Mr. Choudhary has specially appointed me to trouble you. But why? What have we done to him? You have troubled his daughter. Mr. Choudhary can never tolerate that. Mr. Choudhary's daughter? I don't even know him. What nonsense are you talking? Suraj knows him. He dreams of marrying Kiran. Kiran? Is Kiran Mr. Choudhary's daughter? You are inviting your death by messing with Mr. Choudhary. What happened, Dad? - Nothing, Son. I'm coming. It is in your best interest that you leave the city and it is also your only option. If not, you'll meet well-wishers like us quite often. Do you understand? Move! Hey! Hey! - Suraj.. No. No, Son. Son, listen to me. Let me go, Dad. - Son, listen to me. Come upstairs. It's dinner time. I am feeling very hungry. Come. Please come, Son. Come. Come, Suraj. Dinner is ready. - Mom, I'm coming. Suraj, dinner is served. Your favourite dishes have been prepared even today. Prepare my favourite dishes too someday. I had prepared it last month. - Oh! Don't complain for two months. - Two months! You eat, Son. - At least the bread is of my choice. Son, what happened? Suraj, where are you going? I will be back soon. You should not leave your dinner midway. But.. - Nothing doing. Come back. Come on. Come. Let's have a candlelight dinner tonight. I'm coming. Who is it up so early? Hey, milkman! Hey, mister! Suraj, call up the dairy and order some milk. The phone is dead. Suraj, what is this? You haven't changed yet. The match is about to start. What is the matter? Coach, if I play today half the team will not play because of me. I'll decide who will play and will not and not them. You go, change quickly. But, sir.. - I don't want to hear anything! You are on in two minutes. Am I clear? Hi, Suraj! Come on, Suraj. Come on! - Come on.. Come on. Hey, what's happening! I will break both your legs by the time the match ends. Hey, what's this? It's a foul! Cheating! Cheating! Cheating! Cheating! Cheating! Cheating.. Come on, Suraj. Let's show them! Run! Run! Run! Faster. Come on. Come on.. Over here. Come on, Suraj. Yes! To the corner. - Suraj, take the ball. Come on.. Oh, no! - There! Bravo! Let's go. Come on.. Suraj, take it around. Come on, Suraj. Hit towards the goalpost. Come on. Come on, Suraj. It's not fair! Catch it. Come on. Come on. What the hell is he doing? It's a foul.. Foul! Hey, what's wrong with you? It's a foul! Pass the ball to Suraj. - Pass it to Suraj.. Forward.. - Suraj, run ahead. Come on.. Come on, pass it to Suraj. To Suraj. Yes! Yes! Come on.. Come on. Pass it to Suraj. Come on! - Come on, Suraj. Hit it! Come on. - Defence, make formation. Cover him! - Suraj, go ahead! Come on, Suraj. Go for it. Block him.. - Come on.. Come on, Suraj! Come on! Come on! Dive! Yes! Pass it to Suraj! To Suraj! We'll win it.. Oh, dear! Oh, shit! Well done, boys! Well done! It would be fun if you had just played on the ground. But you didn't intend to play there and I don't intend to play here. You wanted to break my legs, didn't you? Now, only the one whose legs remain intact shall leave this place. Come on! "We are insane in love." "We will never accept defeat." "We will play the game of hearts." "We will play, my dear." "We will play the game of hearts, we will play, my dear." "We are insane in love." "We will never accept defeat." "We will play the game of hearts, we will play, my dear." "We will play the game of hearts, we will play, my dear." "No one has ever beaten us. - Never ever." "We swear and challenge you. - We swear." "No one has ever beaten us." "We swear and challenge you." "There's nobody else like us in the entire world." "We are insane in love." "We will never accept defeat." "We will play the game of hearts, we will play, my dear." "We will play the game of hearts, we will play, my dear." "We won't fear the world. - Won't fear the world." "We will just love. - We will love." "We won't fear the world." "We will just love." "We will put everything at stake in the gamble of love." "We are insane in love." "We will never accept defeat." "We will play the game of hearts, we will play, my dear." "We will play the game of hearts, we will play, my dear." Mr. Choudhary, this time.. Dad! Here. Have some sweets. You too have them. Dad, have some sweets. Wow, you've brought sweets! It tastes good. It tastes good, doesn't it? - Yes. But you didn't tell me what have you brought these sweets for? My friend won a football match today. He played really well. You'd have been astounded had you watched him play. The opponents were after his life but he battled it out. It was raining goals. Dad, I had lots of fun. I really had a great time. Why aren't you guys eating the sweets? Have it. Dad, I'm really happy. I'm throwing my friends a huge party. I'll take your leave now. Bye. - Okay, dear. Oh, no! Don't lose hope. There is none left. You had said that you will set everything right. Tell me, how do I manage the house now. There're just two fistfuls of rice left. Yes, I know we have a problem. Choudhary's men follow me wherever I go. Whenever I am about to buy something they snatch my wallet and give all the money to the shopkeeper. I am fed up! I don't know what to do. We will have to do something. Suraj will lose courage if he gets to know about this. Rock, you? At this hour? Come in. I've a surprise for you. - Surprise? Come on, guys. What is all this? - Hi, Suraj. Give it.. See. Did you see that? How happy Suraj is to see you here? Rock, I will recite him a couplet. That will cheer him up. Sam, try to gauge the situation at least. - Okay. Rock, what is all this? Choudhary's men can stop you from buying provisions not the entire city. That's why you brought it! Thanks, friend. Hey, no formalities in friendship. Come on! Amrita, these boys have come as angels and proved that goodness that can never cease to exist in this world. I am overwhelmed when I realise that there are parents better than us who imbue such culture in their children which preserves mankind's faith on humanity. Are you Prakash Saxena? - Yes. Come with us. The commissioner has summoned you. Good morning, sir. - Are you Prakash Saxena? Yes. - You are under arrest. On what charge? You are being arrested on charge of selling classified documents belonging to our country to another country. Sir, you are mistaken. I.. Who are you trying to mess with? If you had made your son see sense you would probably have saved yourself. Now rot in jail like a criminal. But sir, I have done no such thing. Prakash Saxena, I know that. A middle class man can never earn lots of money. He can only earn respect. You have earned enough respect. Bow you'll be disgraced. Take him away. - Come on! But I.. - Come along! Dad.. What have I done! A son becomes successful when his father is recognised by his son's name. That is what you had taught me. But I've brought shame upon you. You are being punished for what I have done. If Choudhary thinks it is a crime to love someone then, I have committed that crime. I should be punished for it, not you or the rest of my family. Saxena, your son is right. You have neither committed a crime nor have you sinned. Yet you have made one mistake. You are the father of that arrogant son who did not do my bidding. But this is not the end, Saxena. This is just the beginning. You cannot even imagine how this would end. You could have made your son see sense, but you did not do that. Perhaps your rich dreams made you keep mum. Your son kept crossing his limits and you kept encouraging him. Today, I snatched everything from you. Your job, yourself respect, your honour, everything! But you still have time, Saxena. If you can make your impudent son see sense, do it. Take him away from my daughter and this city. I will return you everything. Everything! Just a word from me and your family will be allowed to live in peace. I had heard about God and had seen Him in idols till now. But I saw Him in person today. Wow! You will permit us to live! You're under a misconception that I've lost something and you can return it. What have I lost? I have lost nothing in the eyes of my family and my soul. No one can take away one's self-respect. I am not ashamed of my son's deeds. He has loved someone. He has faith in his love. And he has the courage to fight a man like you who despises love. I am proud of my son, Suraj. Had you been fortunate to have a son like Suraj even you would have been proud of him. I think his entire family has gone mad. Saxena, a poor man's pride cannot act as his shield. It can only bring about his death. And you are not aware of Ranvir Choudhary's power. Enough Mr. Choudhary! Enough! We are well aware of you and your power. We are not proud, we are courageous. Courage can move even mountains and you are just a tiny hill in comparison. You cannot break us. Kiran is neither a mission nor an achievement for me. She is my prayer, my worship. No can take away what's rightfully mine. No one. Saxena.. Once I lose my temper, I'll bring about your ruin. Drive some sense into your son before it's too late or else, you will regret it. You give me the bail papers. Here you go. Pawar. Release Saxena. - Yes, sir? Okay. Sir, please forgive me. No dear, you are not to be blamed for this. Are you angry? - Don't talk to me! Who do you think you are? Do you think you can fight the world alone? What do you want to prove? Tell me. Tell me, what do you want to prove? That you are great? That you are powerful? Kiran.. - Don't touch me. I hate you! I hate you.. Dad was so unfair to you and you tolerated everything quietly. Suraj, you have lots of patience. You had to suffer a lot because of me and you did not even let me know about it. You felt I didn't deserve to know.. I tried to tell you many times. But I didn't want to break your heart. How could I tell you when I saw how much you love your father and respect him? Kiran.. There is a strong bond between you and your father. What kind of a bond is this, Suraj? I cannot believe he is doing this to us. I will never see him again. Never. - Hey.. Do you trust me? Do you have faith in our love? Then, you should also respect your father's feelings. Suraj, I am scared. I cannot live without you. Stupid girl, I'll never let that happen. You don't know him, Suraj. I know him very well. He love you very much, doesn't he? A man who can feel that kind of love cannot hate anyone for long. It's late. I'll drop you home. You were two and a half years old when I took this picture. It was your first day at school and you were crying. Deshpande said that it's normal for a child to cry on its first day at school because it is separated from its parents for the first time. But I couldn't bear to see my daughter in tears. I decided that I will home-school you. I stayed with you in school everyday until I saw you smile. Dear.. Whenever I was faced with some major problem I would look at your face. It evoked such inspiration in me that I could take on the whole world. But why can't I see that today? Why can't I see the face the face that made me what I am today? Dad, I am still the same. Then, why can't you evoke the same courage in me? Kiran, you have never kept any secrets from me until today. Because you have never done anything that'd an put me to shame. But today, you aren't seeing me in the eye. Suraj is a wrong which I can forgive you for. Love can never be wrong. But men can be wrong! Dear, I have experienced bitter truths of life. I have gone through the worst. I have come across all kinds of people. I can judge what's right and wrong better than you. What you call as love doesn't exist in real life. I know that you can never be happy with Suraj. I won't be able to forgive myself if I find you unhappy. I have always thought in your interest and always will. Then, why am I scared, Dad? Suraj respects you a lot. He believes that the one who loves cannot hate anyone for long. Restraining love turns into selfishness. I know that my father is not selfish. Dad.. I am the same as I was before. Wow, Mr. Choudhary! The day was real good. Everybody supported you. No one even dared to blink for as long as you spoke. Actually, I had become very emotional. I cannot express the level of destruction the earthquake in Gujarat has brought about. It's heartening that everyone have been very generous with contributions. We have raised Rs. 20 crores. Yes? - Mr. Choudhary. Excuse me. Please come with me for a while. - Excuse me. What is it? - Suraj is leaving the city? Are you telling me this or are you asking me? Pardon me, Mr. Choudhary. I read it in the newspaper. That's why I am asking you. In which newspaper? - In 'Lok Jagran'. What was reported? It was reported that you personally visited Prakash Saxena in prison when you learnt that he had been accused of treason. - What! You even said that you strongly believed that a patriot like him can even lay down his life for the nation. He can never dream of betraying the country. Have a look. 'Choudhary bats for Prakash Saxena.' Deshpande. Deshpande! - Yes, sir? Who owns 'Lok Jagran'? - Mr. Taneja. I have told you several times that my name shouldn't appear in any newspaper linked to a controversy. Then how come this newspaper published my name? And that too, in the Prakash Saxena case? Sir, I don't understand how this happened.. Deshpande, people have started raising questions. Their voices will be suppressed. Rock! - Where were you all day? I have been calling your residence. No one's receiving the call. The house is locked since morning. I can't find mom and dad anywhere. Rock, this has never happened before. I am afraid that.. - Choudhary.. Hello. What are you saying! Yes, I am coming. I am on my way. What happened? - Choudhary's men beat up Billy. Billy? Where is he? - In the hospital. Let's go. - No, you wait here.. It's possible that your parents might return. I will check on Billy and call you up from there. But you keep contacting me too. Take care. Hey! No! No.. Let me go. Grab him! Talk! Tell me where my parents are! Speak up! Tell me where my parents are! I won't spare anybody! - Suraj! Suraj, what're you doing? He will die! - Talk! I will kill everyone! - Leave him, Suraj! He will die! Suraj, he'll die! He'll die! I will kill everybody! - He'll die! Let him go! I won't spare him! - Suraj! Tell me where my parents are! I won't spare anyone! - Suraj, listen to me! He'll die! Suraj! - What did you do to them? Tell me where my parents are! Tell me where my parents are! Suraj, your parents are with m..- - Tell me where my parents are! Suraj! Your parents are with me. They are safe. They are safe. They are safe! They're safe. I searched the entire city and I find you here! Kiran, let's go home. Kiran, let's go home. I love you. "Love is a storm that never stops, regardless of the obstacles." "Love is a storm that never stops, regardless of the obstacles." "The whole world may pause.." "but love never.. - Bows down." Mr. Choudhary.. Love is not a deception. It's a bond. Mr. Choudhary, Kiran belongs to you and she will go with you today. But she is also mine and one day you'll give me her hand in marriage along with your blessings. No one can separate Kiran from me. No one. What happened, Suraj? What are you thinking? There's plenty of difference between reality and ideals. Sam, I was confident that Mr. Choudhary would gradually understand our feelings. But what happened tonight wasn't right. What will happen now, Suraj? I only ignited the spark. Now, there'll be an explosion. What else? "A free spirit.." "A free spirit.." "My beloved is a free spirit." "A free spirit.." "My beloved is a free spirit.." "Take me along, O, free spirit.." "A free spirit.." "A free spirit.." "A free spirit.." "Seven notes make a tune." "Seven notes make a tune." "Seven skies and seas." "Seven lives and seven vows." "Seven lives and seven vows." "I'll fulfil all seven vows." "I'll be beside you forever." "A free spirit.." "A free spirit.." "A free spirit.." "Your love is one dimensional." "Your love is one dimensional." "My affection makes up the other dimension." "One dimension of the cruel world." "One dimension of insanity." "Insanity.." "One dimension of insanity, one dimension of treason." "A free spirit.." "The free spirit has eluded me.." "Take me along, O, free spirit.." "A free spirit.." "My beloved is a free spirit.." "Take me along, O, free spirit.." "A free spirit.." "A free spirit.." Deshpande. - Yes, sir? I shouldn't find Suraj in this city henceforth. Do you understand? - Yes, sir. Go, look for him upstairs. This place is locked. Where is Suraj? - I don't know, sir. You don't know, do you? Where is Suraj? I- I don't know, but his bike is parked here. Maybe he is somewhere nearby. Suraj! Why are you smashing Suraj's bike? Why're you venting your anger on the bike? Where is Suraj? What are you staring at! Beat up those bastards! Hey, catch him! Don't let him get away. Ronnie.. - Suraj. Suraj, Choudhary's men are looking for you. When Rock and Sam did not reveal anything they started beating them up. Suraj, you run away. Run! - Come with me. At least tell me now where Suraj is. You took a long time to come and he took long to speak up. No Deshpande, I took a long time to come and you took a long time to leave from here. Beat the scoundrel! Get him.. Where did he go? You go that way. Over there. - Come on.. Keep looking. Don't let him get away. What's wrong with you? Why did you come downstairs? Sir, he is not here. - Did you check properly? Did you check every room? Where did he disappear? Did he fly away? Hey, get that scoundrel! After him. Climb up. Climb.. Beat him up, Suraj! Beat him! Beat him up, Suraj! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him up, Suraj! Deshpande, did you take care of Suraj? Enough, Mr. Choudhary. I cannot handle it anymore. Mr. Choudhary, you won. I lost. You want me to leave this city, don't you? I am leaving, but not alone. I'm taking your daughter along with me. Come, Mr. Choudhary. I was confident that you would come. Where is Kiran? I ask you, where is Kiran. What do you think? That Kiran is with me? If I had to do this with Kiran then, I would have left the city long back. I had sent her along with you, didn't I? You tell me where Kiran is. Kiran is never yours. Don't you dare sat that again! Do you understand? "Love is insanity.." Do I have to explain more? "This insanity.." "This insanity." You cannot be hers! My daughter cannot be yours! You are worthless! She.. She is the light of my life. You can never get her. Mr. Choudhary, my son is not defeated. but it's my upbringing which is stopping him. My son can never be defeated. My son can never be defeated. Suraj, get up. Son, get up. Mr. Choudhary.. Kiran is my prayer my faith, my love my madness. No one can take her away from me. Not even you. You can't do anything. You will either hand Kiran over to me or kill me! No, Chaudhary! No! Come on! Shoot me! Let go of me! No, Choudhary! - Shoot! I said, shoot me! I said, shoot me! "It drives you mad.. - Love.." "It can pit you against God.. - Love.." "This insanity.." "This insanity.." "This insanity.." "This insanity is love.." Kiran, did you see that? This is stupidity! It is madness! I would never believe that anyone can love my daughter more than me. Dear, you were right. You were right. I don't have any more courage to fight your love. Suraj loves you a lot. Go to him. "This insanity is love.." "The world.." - Bravo! "Crazy.." "What drives people insane?" "Those who fall in love would know.." "Only those who love would know what drives people insane." "The whole world is crazy in love.." "The whole world is crazy in love.." "What drives people insane? Insane! - Insane.." "Those who fall in love would know.. - They'd know.." "Crazy.."
