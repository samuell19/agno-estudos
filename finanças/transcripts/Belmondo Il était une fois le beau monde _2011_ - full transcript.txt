For me Belmondo is an old wave cinema. It is a symbol of the whole era of French cinema. He is admired by many actors. For me, Belmondo is the cinema of the 60s and 70s. Boxer playing boxers. For the union, the CGT is an important character. He did such tricks! This is a unique film actor. He starred in films that will remain in the history of cinema. I grew up with his films. He has so much energy and generosity. It is a ray of light. Belmondo is Shakespeare's dangerous stunt and monologue. Everyone knows him - both old people and children. There are very few such celebrities. He embodies the history of cinema. This is... This is very impressive. If you don't feel it, change your profession. BELMONDO Il était une fois le beau monde In that era films were made completely differently, they were written differently, otherwise filmed... This was the era of the Belmondo style. Belmondo owes its appearance period of emancipation both society and art, emancipation of morals and revolutions in cinema. Cinema has become more like life. And Belmondo is life, this is freedom. The heroes he played in the new wave films were the embodiment of this freedom. Without roles in Godard there would be no roles for de Broca, Neither Verney nor Lautner. But his life in art began much earlier. Jean-Paul Belmondo has always been different. He dreamed of becoming a clown dreamed of becoming a boxer. I train constantly, hitting the pear boxing with Osel. Like in the ring. - Jean-Paul Belmondo: 1.80 m, 72 kg. - It's me! But his dream become new Marcel Cerdan never came true. What do I remember? We played football together. We went in for sports, went on vacation together. I remember it... We were friends. - Who are you on the field? - I'm a goalkeeper. I jump, catch the ball. And I act in films for a change. Realizing that he will not become a boxer, he decided to become an actor. Until 1968, France preferred strict morals, so it wasn't easy for Belmondo. The teachers believed that the profession of an actor is not his path. I was told that this is a great guy that his surname is Belmondo. That he has an incredible appearance that he is a wonderful person. I squeeze through the crowd and see: stands Jean-Paul, with a naked torso, and does a number with dumbbells. True, he did not have dumbbells, it was a pantomime. He was beautifully built like a real athlete. I want to say, that Jean-Paul became famous even before how did you start filming in popular and commercial films. In our drama school there were many talented students. Kremer, Claude Riesch, Mariel, Rochefort... And of course, Belmondo. We have been friends for a long time. Although there were periods when we had little contact. I knew his parents, his mother... I have known Jean-Paul since I was 18. We studied together. Hooligans together. He was our favorite a young film actor. I adored him. And now I love him. Jean-Paul Belmondo - Roman legionnaire of the second category. Belmondo got minor roles. This did not stop him from being different. His appearance on stage caused a violent reaction from the audience, and sometimes - and sheer fun. To play comedic roles you have to be very talented. Jean-Paul - a true actor. Jean-Paul is constantly playing. He played all his life - both in childhood and in his youth. He remained a child. He laughs like he did as a child. On the theater stage Belmondo was cramped. He believed that the acting profession should be learned not in school, but outside its walls, where there is a real audience. In 1955 Belmondo is taking the final exam. He chooses a passage from the play by Freudo and gives it out in the style of Belmondo. It was a slap in the face for academism. But they did not understand him again. Schoolmates were delighted and the examination board is terrified. But Belmondo was not taken aback, it was not a failure for him. He realized that the main thing is to please the public. We received a classical acting education. There are no such exercises for diction now. "From Pernambuca to Potomac the tagged Inca feed on poppy. " Such are the tongue twisters... Jean-Paul understood that I have to make my way myself. He began to take the first uncertain steps. Played in two films one of which was produced by the union CGT. But he was not noticed. It's good that there were friends. Father rehearsed "The Taming of the Shrew." Played by Petruchio. In the play he has two servants. One has already been. They were looking for a second. I told him what's in our school there is a talented guy. By the name of Belmondo. The father asks: "Is Belmondo the sculptor's son?" I say yes". "Let him come. We will listen to him." Jean-Paul auditioned and was hired. They are with their father played in the same performance and became very good friends. He stood backstage and watched how my father plays. He admired Pierre, and they became close friends. In 1958 he played in the play "Oscar". This role brought him great success. - Jean-Paul Belmondo. - Demetrius Ader, private detective. - Not. - Horace Mac Tod, poet. Not. - Jeff Trotsky, adventurer. - Not. - Jeff Miller, attorney. - Right! Belmondo played in Mademoiselle Ange "Two turns" in the TV movie "The Three Musketeers" Who you are? The knight who saves the lady! Let her go! Swords? Excellent! Better than batons! While filming a TV movie he played the whole scene, as if it was a live broadcast. And then one day strange young man wearing sunglasses asked Jean-Paul to come to his hotel for a test. Belmondo was intrigued. His wife advised him to go. So he starred in the short film "Charlotte and Her Jules". He felt the freedom that he lacked. These people were film critics. They knew cinema very well. It was a new wave. They filmed absolutely freely. Not in studios, but on location, with small cameras. Raoul Coutard took off from his shoulder, without light, in natural light. There was no script. He scribbled something on the packs of "Zhitan". This is how the film "On the last breath" was filmed. Jean-Paul used to say: "This Swiss will carry me through." The agent discouraged him to star in Godard. "Why do you need this moron? Do not!". There is no light on the shoot, one light is hanging. This is how they made their films. This is a telling story. This is the history of cinema. He sent everyone away, began to shoot a strange movie. "On the last breath." Nobody understood anything. The director was considered an idiot. As a result, this film is considered a key one in world cinema. Behind the apparent childishness was a serious and a responsible attitude towards cinema. Belmondo admitted that I never felt such freedom again. I didn't understand right away that there was something new in his way of playing. There was naturalness in his play ease. Jean-Luc Godard, Belmondo is filming for you, as in the report. Because it is you. He wouldn't do it with others. I don’t think so. We work in a very casual manner. I meant the script. You write the scenes while shooting. You don't know what will happen tomorrow. He likes it. He's as lazy as I am. The success of the film "On the last breath" was for him an absolute surprise. This made him famous. His portrait began to be printed on the covers glossy magazines, call it a star. He was simply stunned. He was besieged by female fans and foreign journalists. They began filming him in Italy. Great Italian directors like De Sica, like Visconti. De Sica invited him for a second role in "Chochara" with Sophia Loren. In 1960, Belmondo, like Delon, began filming with the Italians. We didn't think about a career. We all dreamed of a theater. We, like our forerunners, like my father's generation, didn't take the movie seriously. After the film Godard became interested in him Melville. He starred in his films "Leon Morin" "Snitch" "Fershaw Sr." But Belmondo was bored with him. Melville was very tough director. But Belmondo he was not afraid. Melville was an unbalanced man he always had an object of bullying in his group. This time it was Vanel. Belmondo showed fearlessness and began to defend Vanel. And even got into a fight with Melville. He left from the set of "Fershaw Sr." This is an unknown fact. The film was never completed because Belmondo and Vanel refused to appear. Belmondo took Vanel's arm and said: "Let's get out of here, we don't belong in this mental hospital." And they left. In the life of Belmondo simultaneously appeared two famous filmmaker: Philippe de Broca and Henri Verneuil. Belmondo was lucky. In the films of de Broca and Verney he showed, what is he physically capable of, and played with great partners like Gaben. I love the painting "Monkey in winter". Although Jean-Paul has starred so much that it is difficult to choose. But this is one of the favorites. These are Odyard-Blondin and Gabin-Belmondo. They quickly became friends. They both loved football. Gaben was a master young actors who starred in the film. Belmondo becomes his worthy heir. In the film "Cartouche" Belmondo was unique. The film had great success. "Cartouche" is one of the first films that I loved. I adored Belmondo and Claudia Cardinale. This was the Belmondo era. De Broca gave him the opportunity to do what he always dreamed of. In "The Man from Rio" he plays a hero, moreover, in an exotic country. As if in old Europe it was cramped as if only outside of it he could afford do whatever he pleases. Jean-Paul was exactly the actor he needed Philip. Jean-Paul loved the stunts he did himself without stuntmen. He did not like when directors constrained by his impulses, as it was when he played the role of the curé. With Philip, he did whatever he wanted. They are both... They were like children. What it is?! Go away! This is how it started shooting a movie that can be called calm and enjoyable. Admit that you were scared. Of course, I'm not Superman. I was scared to do these tricks. The setting helped me reigned in the film crew. It was only possible because that we all got along fine. From cameraman to director, things went swimmingly. The group had a wonderful attitude. It helped me. Not a role, but a raspberry! I tell them: "That's it! I'm leaving!" They answer: "No!" I say, "Okay." And they: "We'll release the tension." It is important for him to have a good atmosphere on the set. So that everyone has a good mood to make people laugh. Marie-Heloise, I confess to you: I am a dwarf. Yes, this is my sister. It doesn't seem to work. We laugh, we joke. He is constantly naughty. So he prepares to shoot. Nobody picks up the phone! Hello! Yes darling. I was just here... Get out! How tired of him! It's childish, this cheerful vibe were inherent in all films in which Belmondo starred. They all studied at the same drama school, worked with each other for 30-40 years old. He is a loyal friend he is very generous passionate and highly professional person. I love him. It was easy to make friends with him. It was open and accessible. He laughed like all normal people. He was on the set of a movie who was filming not so in Bulgaria, not in some other the country of the socialist camp. During the party, my father started playing tricks. And if he plays tricks, then it will not seem a little. In short, he was taken to the station. He ended up in a police station in a socialist country. In the morning the gendarmes bring my father to the hotel, call the producer and say: "Sorry, but Monsieur Brasseur has to leave the country." The father goes up to the room and begins to collect things. Collected things and went to say goodbye with Jean-Paul. He asks what happened. "Listen, Jean-Paul, excuse me. I missed it yesterday. I'm being kicked out of the country. " "Like this?" The father went down to the foyer with a suitcase. Jean-Paul suddenly appears, also with a suitcase. The father began to say goodbye to everyone. Jean-Paul also began to say goodbye. They ask him: "What is it?" It was a co-production. Jean-Paul says: "My contract says that my partner is Monsieur Brasseur. If he leaves, I'll leave too. " Everyone was just stunned. And the father was left on the set. Like this. During filming, he used to joke and joke. The hotel workers were afraid of him like the fire. An incredible story happened on the Magnificent. On the set in Mexico, Belmondo celebrated its 40th anniversary. He threw such a party! The group lived in a fancy hotel they smashed windows and shop windows there. Grabbing hotel customers and throwing them into the pool. Some couldn't swim. They were rescued, an ambulance was called. It was incredible! They were presented with such a bill! The next morning Belmondo sobered and went to the hotel director. And the hotel director smiles and says: "I hope you have had a pleasant evening with us. All expenses we take over. " We made such a thing that oh-oh-oh! Such, which is hard to imagine. That is, for which people are imprisoned. You come up to her... What? What are you staring at me for? I listen to you. Such pictures are taken by people who like to laugh. So we work and have fun. I do not like it when they work with an elongated physiognomy. Not! This territory belongs to France. An unusual team trains here ball players. Don't touch me! Perfectly. I have a feeling that there are ghosts here. Very strange. We loved to laugh. It was on the set of Borsalino. We walked past the port. I say: "We bet on a piece, that you can't jump into the water. "And he took it and jumped. In clothes. Delon did not understand anything. I explained to him about the dispute. He says: "But what about the suit? It costs 3 pieces! "For a piece, he was ready for anything. The Robbery was filmed in Greece. Their television did not broadcast the boxing championship. And so, without saying anything to anyone, neither the producer nor the director, we boarded a private jet and flew away. Took with them our make-up and dresser... To on the way back they prepared us for shooting. The fight ended at 6 in the morning by 8:30 we had to return to Athens. We thought that they would make up for us on the plane and we immediately let's go to the site. Today when shooting day ends when the show ends the actors immediately go home. And when I started, we ended and they all went to supper together. Our friends were waiting for us. After the show we never parted. On the screen Belmondo lived life that everyone dreamed of. It seemed that everything is so simple. He didn't need to concentrate. He was laughing, having fun. But after the command "Motor!"... Start right away so you don't waste film. After the firecracker, he was transformed. If he played some unfortunate person he could immediately cry. Although he just played football. I'm sorry. He knows exactly what to do. Although he was just talking about boxing. He doesn't teach texts. He remembers them at the last minute, right before the cracker. He reads the script, reflects on the role. I don’t know for sure. Ask him yourself. I don't think there are actors who come to the set not knowing their role. It would be too easy. - What do you do between takes? - I admire the sea. Mad Pierrot is an amazing movie. There is so much freedom, so much poetry in it! Modern, imperfect. Hence - revolutionary. On the set of Belmondo experiences incredible pleasure. He has a unique style of play. Many actors have adopted it. But he is its initiator. It all starts in the soul of an actor. Often in acting studios, people are forced to grab your head and mutter: "I am a tree, I am an apple" ... I do not understand this. For Belmondo, the main thing is pleasure. Enjoy your game. The actor plays. For him, the game has a double meaning. This is both acting and child's play. During shooting, the main thing to be generous with everyone around us. If in a person no generosity, then everything goes to hell, if you do not give a piece of yourself, then nothing will work. Jean-Paul Belmondo was an example for me. He knows it. I am not imitating it. This actor infected me with desire to act in popular films, feel free and independent. He managed to express himself in a variety of genres. European, French cinema is very creative, so Belmondo was very lucky. He was filming and in entertaining pictures, for example, in de Broca's films, and in auteur cinema. In "The Man from Rio", in "The Misadventures of a Chinese in China" he jumps, runs, chases. But he is also strong in auteur cinema, in Godard's films... "Mad Pierrot" and "The Misadventures of a Chinese in China" were filmed one by one. And both are good. He is an actor from God. In 1966 he starred in the movie "The Thief" by Louis Malle. This is typically auteur cinema. The role did not match Belmondo's character. However, he played amazingly. The audience received him coldly. It was not the same Belmondo which she was used to seeing. In the film, he is sullen and withdrawn. Belmondo played a hero with a scoffing combined with joylessness. He no longer had such roles. The viewer did not go to this film. Three years later at the Mississippi Sirens Truffaut decides to go even further. In a love relationship with the heroine Catherine Deneuve Belmondo plays the role of "woman" and Deneuve is "men". The audience didn't like it. The film flopped. Public reaction chilled Belmondo. "What kind of a man who is being pushed around by a woman! We don't recognize our favorite actor! " It had such an effect on him that he made a decision never again disagree on roles weaklings and weaklings. Two superstars of the era, two idols Delon and Belmondo - were partners in the film "Borsalino". Western "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" gave Delon the idea to make a film about two friends. They were the most popular actors in France. In "Borsalino" they are very different. One is a laid-back merry fellow the second is an introverted romantic. Alain was... severe, significant with a sleek head. And Jean-Paul was natural, uninhibited. Exquisite. Belmondo and Delon were exquisite actors. There are many good actors. For example, Depardieu. This is a great actor. I was filming with him. But when Delon and Belmondo go ashore in Borsalino... It `s Magic... They overshadowed everyone who was with them. I am with my height, I would work as an errand boy. When they bared their torso and exposed their biceps... Of course, no one could compete with them. They starred in short swimming trunks! Can you imagine? Even George Clooney can't compete with them. Nobody tried. The film was an incredible success. In 1970, Belmondo found himself at a crossroads. He did not know which role suits him best. He devoted himself completely to his roles. Desire to be the best desire to please the viewer pushed him to risk. He completely devoted himself to his roles, he was adequate to his heroes. This is sometimes dangerous. But not tragic. I believe in Belmondo. In The Robbery all dangerous stunts he performed himself. In one scene, he jumped onto a tram. I asked him: "Why do you need this? You're going to crash. " He didn't want to hear about stuntmen. Belmondo could not be convinced by anything. The dump was full of piles, a piece of iron. It was very dangerous. But he himself demanded second take, feeling that in the first something is wrong. Although Verneuil himself did not want reshoot. He doesn't like being told about it. He had to perform an important cascade: jump from a great height. He looked at me and said, "I feel like I can't jump." That was incredible. He realized that he could not. And he said to Verney: "Let's shoot it tomorrow." He was a fearless actor. He wanted to please the viewer, and the viewer appreciated it. They filmed at a subway station. During filming, the station master was supposed to direct the movement of trains. In this scene Jean-Paul runs across the roof, then jumps. Between two takes stationmaster walks up to Jean-Paul and says: "I would for no money did not agree to this. " Jean-Paul replies, "Me too." He was not dizzy. He was capable of anything. He reincarnated. This was not a normal person, but Superman. In the film "Fear over the City" all the tricks Belmondo performs himself. He completely merges with his character. If I were a spectator, I would like the actor to do it. He told me, that he wants to do everything himself. I said, that it is dangerous, that he might hurt himself. That is why he decided to do everything himself. This is the poetics of Belmondo: he played with life and did everything so that we believe that there is no death. He opens for us the world in which he keeps most expensive. Fun, delight, passion, laughter. "Is being an actor hanging in your underpants under a helicopter?" "You have no idea what a pleasure it is!" The main thing for him is that in the script there were a lot of tricks. He's crazy. He is incorrigible. He is ready for anything: grow a mustache, a beard, then shave everything off... He loves it. Jean-Paul has something of Fregoli. Daring, brave. He always went against the tide. In the 60s he embodied freedom, In the 70s - indecision doubt. Whoever he plays - a rebel or a policeman, he played a hero. He was a hero a hero of France, the hero of each of us. We wanted to be his friend, his son. He played football, boxed loved amazing women. In life, he was the same as in the films. Could jump into a convertible or stand on the shore and look into the distance. We flew to New York in the Concorde. To the battle of Cassius Clay. The plane had one motor out of order. When a Concorde's engine stalls, it stands up like this. There were 70 passengers on the plane. And what do you think? They rushed to him: "Monsieur Belmondo, do something!" Gradually his characters became like himself. It became more important than acting. He becomes part of the film industry. His participation in the film guaranteed success. He was expected like James Bond. The actor Belmondo has become a brand. Films were similar to one another. He played the same character. With different shades: this is more drama this is more comedy. Police officer or bandit. I remember the poster where he was wearing a cap with a cigar. We went to Belmondo. An advertising system was developed, were created special posters. They were identical. Regardless of the movie. It started with the poster for the movie "Fear Over the City". His last name was typed in the same font, moreover, without a name. Belmondo is a pillar of our cinema. If you are asked to play yourself, and not different characters? It won't be interesting. Actor is a wonderful profession. Playing only yourself is not interesting. I love to reincarnate. Play butcher tonight tomorrow - the director of the plant. Film by Gerard Uri "Ace of the Aces" with Belmondo in the lead role, he crushed everyone. It all came together: Gerard Ury directed The Great Walk, the film starred the most beloved French actor. There were posters everywhere, he was on all the screens. During the same period, the film was released director Jacques Demi "A Room in the City". This film was given to him hardly. Both films came out in one day. And of course the audience did not go to the social musical by Jacques Demi. We wrote a petition in defense of the film by Jacques Demi. As a result, Gerard Ury's film, where he played Belmondo. But that's not what we wanted. If we knew, we would not have written the petition. She and Uri wrote an open letter, in which Cocteau was mentioned... And it seems Bernanos... "We won't leave it like that..." And Cocteau added: "We will cut off your heads..." It was called "A Letter to the Executioners". The main thing for us is to please the viewer, not a handful of Parisians. We play to delight the viewer. But one does not exclude the other. They believe that we must save the world... I want to please the viewer. I prefer acting in films that I enjoy. He liked it: incredible success, fame, beautiful life. He loved being a star. The audience was attracted by his generosity. People went to Jean-Paul Belmondo, to enjoy. He had no other purpose. Although he starred in films new wave. But this was often forgotten. When people went to the movie "Outlaw", they knew they were going to have fun. Thrillers overshadowed all other genres. It was obvious that Belmondo was repeating itself. This genre has reached a dead end. Television took over the baton. TV series appeared on the first channel such as "Moulin", "Navarro", "Julie Lescaut". Together with Belmondo, his audience also grew old. People preferred to sit at home in front of the TV and watch TV shows, reminiscent of the films in which he starred Belmondo. Belmondo did not fit into the new film era. In the late 80s he played the role of a man who drops everything and tries start life anew. "The darling of fate" - very interesting film. Belmondo played brilliantly. This is his last big film. This bearded man is none other than Belmondo. Claude Lelouch took him to the lead role of his new film "Minion of Fate". At the airport while waiting for a flight, the prologue to the picture is being filmed, which symbolizes their long-awaited meeting. We knew that the viewer who loves Belmondo love this movie. Because in it he is completely different. Gray-haired, bearded... An old bum. The story is quite interesting. The person leaves the past and decides to start a new life. It was a metaphor for the Belmondo story. I have always believed that Belmondo possessed incredible charisma, charm, sense of humor. And great love of life. There was a feeling what is between Belmondo and his character there is something in common. He agreed, without reading the script. Lelouch told him a story. But there was no script. Belmondo has long been never experienced anything like it. Lelouch stood behind the camera and prompted him cues. And Belmondo repeated them, and so naturally! He liked it all very much. He has earned public recognition. Did he want creative recognition? Which do I prefer - theater or cinema? Pierre Brasseur said on this occasion: "It's like asking whom we love more - mom or dad. " I absolutely agree with him. Successful film actor decided to remember your first love? Cinema is not a classical art form. Unlike sculpture. Sculptor father once said to him: "But what about true art?" When he decided to return to the theater, I worked in the troupe of the Marigny theater. This was not the Belmondo that everyone knew. It was Belmondo the debutant. To quench your thirst for theater Belmondo chose a character role. He played Keane in Genius and Dissatisfaction. This is the whole Belmondo. He seemed to want catch up with lost time, play everything unplayed roles. Belmondo goes back to basics his profession and gets the main acting award. The prize goes to Jean-Paul Belmondo, for her role in "Bald of Fate". Jean-Paul did great career. Graduated from drama school, starred in new wave films, in classic paintings, returned to the theater again. This is a true actor. There was nothing accidental in his career. He did not take a single wrong step. He made a brilliant career. As always, Belmondo surprised everyone. He only trusted his audience the audience he lost in the movies and who came to the theater. He played in the plays "Cyrano de Bergerac", "Lady's Tailor", "The Great Frederick"... Cyrano went on for a year and a half. At the Marigny Theater. These are 1,450 lines of poetry. Difficult role. After the performance, a crowd was always waiting for him in front of the theater. Keene and Cyrano... He just flew around the stage... Cyrano's role is more complex than Keane's. There is a lot of text there. He was a great Cyrano. He didn't have to stick his nose. It seemed that Belmondo will never return to the cinema. Like a movie actor he wanted to test himself in a new capacity. He decided to follow in the footsteps of classic film actors. Jules Berry, Michel Simon, Remu... When he starred in new wave films it was impossible to imagine. Some actors are retiring. But if they are offered interesting roles, they continue to work. The viewer is not used to see Belmondo in the role respectable heroes. In the movie "One Chance for Two" we seem to... We seemed to apologize in front of the viewer for the film "Specialists", which was filmed 20 years ago. When we wrote the script for One Chance for Two, we knew: If we make a serious film, then we are finished. If the heroes... If there is no self-irony in our heroes, then it's a failure. We needed burlesque. But we didn't know will they agree to play it. They have a sense of humor there is a lot of irony in them. They could play it. But I didn't dare. Today I am very sorry about that. I regret not having made up my mind. They were burlesque ready, they weren't afraid to look funny. I will never forget, like Jean-Paul Belmondo came up to me and said: "I have a suggestion. Let's shoot this scene at the end: he drops from the helicopter the stairs I have to get up. I so want to experience it again! This will be my parting number. I just can't get up and he makes fun of me. He suggested it to me himself! It was such a gift for me! I would never did not dare to offer him this: "Delon throws you a ladder, and you can hardly climb it. " I would not dare. The film failed. Belmondo and Delon did not come up with anything new. The viewer stopped loving him. This was already the fourth film that no one went to. It hurt him. After all, he was a symbol of glory, a symbol of success... His films have attracted millions of viewers. Moreover, absolutely mediocre films. I think it hurt him a lot. So he decided to film in an unusual film a young director. By this Jean-Paul Belmondo wanted to say: "Do not touch me. I do what I want". Director Cedric Klapisch tried to throw a bridge between two generations. He has two images. On the one hand, he is a joker, he behaves like a child, he wants to be naughty. On the other hand, he is a strong man. Moreover, both of these sides absolutely harmonious. - Doesn't it hurt? - Not. Look at me! This is the last film in which we see him in excellent physical shape. This is a symbolic film. It tells about his career, about what it combines child and adult. We experienced great excitement while working. We thought: "When he is gone, we will grieve, we will remember what he was brilliant actor ". But not Klapisch's film, neither Lautner's and de Broca's films were successful. When the idea came up to make a film with Delon and Belmondo, we all really liked her. I couldn't wait to get started. But we were wrong. We didn't think that in 1999 the viewer did not care about Delon and Belmondo. He was not interested. It was a TV movie and not to go out on screens. This is stupid. August 8, 2001 "At such moments I understand how far I am, how many gates and barriers will have to be overcome, to get back. " August 8, 2001 at Belmondo there was a stroke. He had to fight the disease. He showed great courage to fully recover. After seven years of silence, he returned to the viewer, returned for one movie time. We want so that the last film is the most outstanding. But life is not so simple. He became a victim serious stroke. This is not a joke. It was difficult for him to act in "Man with a Dog". This is absolutely not the same Belmondo, whom the viewer knew. It's hard for people to see Belmondo a frail old man. However, it is a sign of love. Years go by... Who else is there of those "dinosaurs" left? They all slowly leave in sequence... There are not so many of them left. Belmondo and Delon remained. We must love them while they are with us. Jean-Paul, Alain, I... We all remember with nostalgia about that period, about that movie... All this is in the past. We must come to terms with the fact that this era will not return. Buy tickets Belmondo gave us not only 86 films, where he jumps, flies, jokes, laughs... He gave us his lively ease, go against your art for half a century everyone and everything. We must cherish this wealth. You can love him or not to love. But will we have second de Gaulle? I think no. So it is with Belmondo. The second such will no longer be. So that's it. Jean-Paul Belmondo is like music the music of our life. You hear a familiar note - and you remember some period of it. And not only music, but also the image. There are moments when you want joy. Jean-Paul Belmondo brought joy to thousands of people, who needed it. In "$ 100,000 in the Sun" he says: "I have a house and a duck pond. Looks rich. " When we were returning from filming from Tunisia, he fell asleep in the airplane. People were queuing up to photograph him. It is amazing. Because this is it. Where is Minos? From Fear Over the City. Minos!
