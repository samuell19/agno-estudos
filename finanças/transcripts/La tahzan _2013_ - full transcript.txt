"Do not grieve, for Allah is with us." (Surah At-Tawbah - 40) INSPIRED BY A BEST-SELLER - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Today, we will learn the expression "suki." - "Suki." - Right. "Suki" means like. For example... - I... - I... - like... - like... - bread. - bread. Yok. - Yes, sir? - This is yours. - What is the number? - Number three, sir. That's right. It means "I like bread." - I... - I... - like... - like... - you. - you. Hungry? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Let's eat! Before you start eating... - You really got me a present! - You don't want it? I want it. - What is it? - Just open it. It's so cute, San! No kiss on my cheek? That's for boyfriends. Yeah. I'm not your boyfriend, right? My boyfriend is Japanese. He's handsome like Takeshi Kaneshiro. The price tag is still on it, San? Hello? Yes, what is it? Sorry. Excuse me. Is this your ring? You're right. Thanks. This is my wedding ring. Your Japanese is good. - Thank you. - Thank you. San! I met that Japanese woman in the restroom. She left her ring and I returned it to her. Then she said my Japanese was good. Really? What's the matter, San? What's the matter? Sorry, Neneng sent me a text. Mom is getting worse. Her blood pressure dropped. She almost fainted. - Really? - Yes. I don't really like having to depend on medication too much. Hello? Yes, sir. I'm going to the pharmacy, Viona. Do you know what is keeping Hasan so busy? He seems very preoccupied lately. I don't know what's keeping him busy. Maybe he has a new girlfriend, Mom. He's always on the phone. New girlfriend? Is Hasan all right? What do you mean? Nothing bad happened between you two, right? Please. Hasan and I have always been like this. That is what I don't like about Hasan. You two have been together for years. You even dream of going to Japan together to work. But he never told me what he actually wants. - Checked the battery? - Yes. Just charged it. Watch your mouth. We gave you a chance. Be thankful! Don't you dare! - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Is Hasan there? When did Hasan leave? He left again after returning from the pharmacy. He didn't say where he was going. He's still not home. His phone is turned off. So where is he? Hello? Are you asleep? I fell asleep. Where are you, San? Neneng was looking for you. On my way to Jakarta. - For what? - I have business to do. I'm meeting someone who wants to buy the auto shop. You're selling your auto shop? Yes, if the price is right. And... I'll be staying at my uncle's house this week in Depok. What for? To take care of my visa. God willing, I'm going to Japan. What? What are you going to do in Japan? Work. Are you serious? Yes, I am. This is all so sudden, San. You never told me about this. We promised to go together to Japan. Sorry. But... there are many things that I can't tell you. Is that so? All right. We shouldn't contact each other for a while. Peace be upon you. Hasan, the taxi is here. Okay, I'm coming. Mom. Be careful, my son. Take care of yourself. Never forget to pray. Understand? Yes, Mom. Where is Viona? Are you meeting her at the airport? Viona and Hasan are fighting. They haven't talked for a while. Why? - Peace be upon you. - Upon you too. - This is Viona, ma'am. - Viona? Did you call me? Have you heard? Hasan is leaving for Japan today. Viona. San. Where are you? On my way to the airport. How could you not tell me? I'll explain everything to you when the situation gets better. But now I... Hello? Viona? SIX MONTHS LATER OSAKA JAPAN Although... all of you study hard here, it will all be in vain if you never practice what you learn on a daily basis. Now, we have a program. It is called "School While Arubaito." "School While Arubaito" means studying while working. I'll go to school in the morning and work in the afternoon. The salary is for paying tuition and daily expenses. Then how will you go to Japan? With whom? Who will help you there? I don't know yet, Mom. But I've never been apart from you this long. How about Dodi? One year in Papua. Has he ever been apart from you for that long? And Hesti? Who's the clingiest one? As long as it isn't unlawful in Islam, okay? WIDYATAMA UNIVERSITY DIPLOMA Ona. Bring this rice with you. You can mix it with Japanese rice. Cook some rice for yourself and eat it. God willing, you'll feel at home there. Okay? I love you so much. Love you too, Mom. - Hello? - Hello? Is this the principal? Viona? Where are you now? I'm at Rokujizo Station. At a pay phone near the station entrance. Are you Viona? - Are you the principal? - That's me! Welcome! Everything's okay, right? Okay, we're here. Come on out. Don't forget your luggage. All of you, let's enter the school. We will enjoy some tea. - Your bag. - Right. Ning! Where is the school? I don't know either. In the brochure, it's a multi-story building. That's Kyoto University, not a language school, Aning. Really? Please come inside. The others have arrived. I'm Yamamoto Masuo, the principal of this school. Today, I would like to introduce some new friends. Studying while working. That is not an easy thing. Starting today, your new life begins. Let's get excited together! Ning, do you even understand what he is saying? Nope. Excuse me, I'm going to take a short break. The building is number three, room number 305. There. Over here. Room 305. A lot of people live in this building. Excuse me. Please come in. Take off your shoes. This is the room. Just put your stuff there. That, too. Come on in. Take off your shoes. Now, I will briefly explain how to use the kitchen. Pull this right here and the lights turn on. Then if you turn this tap... water will come out. These are the kitchen drawers. You can store anything in here. Most importantly, you need to know how to dispose of your garbage. There is wet garbage, dry garbage, used bottles and cans. And... Hold it! For stuff like this, make sure you empty it first. Stomp on it. Then throw it away. Okay, I will explain about the bathroom next. Ona, nobody sells food around here. I was hoping they'd sell something like batagor or meatball soup. You're hungry? - I'm starving, Ona. - We brought noodles. You can eat it. I came all the way to Japan just to eat noodles? It's okay. Eat it until we buy groceries. I don't want it. Just make some. Fine. Suit yourself. - You really got me a present! - You don't want it? The price tag is still on it, San? - San? - Yes, Kus? - Where are you? - On my way home. Don't go home yet, San. Immigration police is patrolling in front of the house. Okay, thanks. - Good morning, everyone. - Good morning. Today I will explain how to study Japanese. We'll have a practice test before that. You all will take the test. Please write down the meaning and reading of Chinese characters. If you have some free time in Japan... please look for Hasan. At the very least, to make sure he is really living there at that address. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Where is Kusnadi? He got caught. When? Immigration officers came to his workplace this afternoon. They caught him. You should be careful, San. Today, I will announce the side jobs. Aning, you'll work at a yakiniku restaurant. Okay. Sir. Don't I get a job? Viona? Sorry. You'll have to wait longer. If you're really sure that you can cover your school fees and provide for yourself, I'll give you my permission because... I can only give you money for a passport, your departure ticket and your living cost for two or three months. Aren't you afraid of getting lost if you go alone? Why should I be afraid, Aning? I have the address. But the place is far away. No problem. - Excuse me. - Yes. Viona! - Viona! - Sir! - Viona! - What is it? You got a job! Let's meet the restaurant manager right now. - Right now? - Yes. - All right. - Come on. Hurry. Welcome! Please come in. Sorry to interrupt. You're busy. I'm Yamamoto. We talked on the phone earlier. You are Yamamoto? Please come this way. This is the female student from Indonesia I told you about. Her name is Viona. Please take care of her. Okay. With pleasure. Let's sit over there. - Here's her resume. - Very good. Please introduce yourself briefly. Let me introduce myself. My name is Viona. I'm 23 years old. Nice to meet you. Have you worked at a sushi restaurant? No, never. You are a foreigner and have never eaten sushi. Can you really work here? But I really like sushi. I see. Okay, then. The restaurant opens at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow, so please come at 1,30 p.m. - Okay. Thank you so much. - Thank you. Happy birthday, Hasan. Prayer rug? So you will always remember me when you pray. That will ruin my concentration. Pervert. Why not a whole complete prayer set? And 10 grams of gold? Ouch! Are you okay? Please be careful. I'm okay. I am fine. You're from Indonesia? Yes. My name is Yamada. Viona. Viona. Be careful, Viona. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I have to go to work. Wait, where do you work? - Shijo. - Shijo? Sorry, I have to go. Wait a minute, Viona! - Sorry, I'm late. - Why are you late? I fell from my bike. We need to do preparations before opening the restaurant. If even one person comes late, nothing runs smoothly. Understand? And customers will get annoyed. Why are you still standing there? Get ready! Go change! Quickly! Viona. So you work here? May I take your order? I just want to chat with you. Please don't. The boss will yell at me. I see. Wait a minute. This is my business card. Are you okay? In three days, I will have a photo shoot here. That means we can meet again. SATOSHI YAMADA PHOTOGRAPHER Hello. Is this Viona? This is Satoshi Yamada. Yamada. How do you know my number? We are friends on Facebook. You can speak Indonesian? My father is Japanese. My mother is Indonesian. - I see. - Viona. Can we meet again? I want to take you on a walk. When is your day off? Monday. Monday? - Want to meet? - Hello! - Do I look okay? - Okay. Okay? Good. See you then. Ouch! Hello, Viona? I've been here for 10 minutes. Where are you? You should keep your promise. You should've told me if you weren't coming, so I don't have to wait. There's no need to be angry. I am here. Where are you? You're already here? - Where are you? - Where are you? Viona! Wait! That's dangerous! Wait! Wait! That's very dangerous. You should've waited. - It's all right. - You don't have to... This is dangerous. I'm sorry. I thought you weren't coming. This way. But be careful. - Careful. - It's okay. I can manage. Careful. Yamada, you like taking pictures? I'm a freelance photographer. I take pictures of almost everything. And then I send them mostly to magazines, newspapers, sometimes websites too. If they like them, they'll pay for them. How about you, Viona? Me? I am a graphic design graduate. A graphic design graduate? There are many specialties, right? Are you... Not an interior designer, but a comic artist? I bet you like drawing comics! That's great! I love it so much! Viona, where should we go now? Do you know where this is, Yamada? This address? Let me see. I think... - I know the area. - Really? Why? - My friend lives there. - Your friend? - From Indonesia? - Yes. It should be around here somewhere. - Number eight? - Toyo-cho, Kita-ku, Osaka, Japan. It's 17. No, I sent it yesterday. 10,000 yen. Yes, maybe it'll arrive tomorrow. Sorry, sir. You are Indonesian? Yes, ma'am. Do you know an Indonesian who lives here? His name is Hasan. Hasan. Yes, I know him, ma'am. He used to live here. But he's not here anymore. Do you know where he is now? I'm afraid I don't know. I tried to call him many times. I even called him a week ago, but no answer. Maybe he changed his number. Okay. But... he posted some new photos on his Facebook page. He changed his name. Yes. He picked the name Orenji when he was still here. Why did he move? He had a problem with immigration. Immigration? He came here using a work visa. But he switched to another company before his contract ended. Why did he do that? Hasan ran away? No, he did not. He resigned legally, but with the condition that he can't work for another company. But he did. He went to look for work at other companies. That's why he tries to avoid immigration officials. Your friend really loves himself. I know this place! I will take you to this place on your next day off, okay? Come on. That's nice. - Yamada. - Yes? Did you forget? You promised to take me to that place in the photo. Right. I forgot about that. Let's head straight there. Okay. This is the place. See? Hasan took a photo here. Wait a second. Hold on. Let me check again. I know this place. Come, quickly. We will go there. See? Same place. Hasan was here, right? I used to have a journalist friend. He said there are many industries around here that employ illegal workers. Mostly from Indonesia. Then how should we look for him? Wait a minute. Excuse me. Do you know this person? Yes, I know him. He was a janitor. He used to come here every day. If I'm not mistaken, he stopped working a long time ago. That's too bad. This is his friend from Indonesia. - She needs to see him. - I see. I think I have his business card. - Really? - I used to call him. But not through the company. I can call him if you like. Wait here. Thank you! Here you go. Thank you very much. - Hasan's phone number. - It's raining. Let's go over there. This is Hasan's number. He used to work in this area as a janitor. - Cleaning service? - Yes. Try calling him. Can you please call him, Yamada? Why me? Isn't he your... I'm just worried this is not the Hasan I'm looking for. You should pretend and call him. Just say that you need a janitor for your office or whatever. Anything, just so we can meet with him. Let me try calling him. 36633-192 - Hello? - Hello? Is this Hasan who used to work at a cleaning service company? Yes, this is Hasan. I need cleaning services for my office. But not through an agent. All right. Sorry, where do you work now? I'm in Osaka. Osaka? Okay. Can we meet next week at Dotombori? Dotombori? Okay. Thank you. See you later. I promised to meet him next week at Dotombori. Thanks. For Hasan Happy 28th Birthday Better late than never Have you been here before? I have. Hello? I just arrived in Dotombori. Okay. Let me call him. Viona! Viona! Where are you going? Viona! Viona! How about if we look... for Bandung batagor? You want that? Ona? Ona. Ona? You're not doing your dawn prayer? It's already late. - Ouch! - What is it? You're burning up. What should I do? You have a fever. I'm going to look for some medicine. What medicine? - Excuse me. - Yes? Is Viona here? Viona called in sick today. Sick? She just called in. I just got the news. Thank you. Sorry, is Viona here? Are you Yamada? Yes, I am. Please wait. Yamada. - May I ask you a favor? - Sure, you can. Viona has a fever. - Please take care of her, okay? - Fever? Yeah, she's burning up. Maybe you can take her to see a doctor. Okay? - Of course. - You sure? - Thank you. - Thank you. I'm counting on you. Go inside. - Viona? - God have mercy. What are you doing here? - Get out. - Why? Is your disease contagious? No, it's not that. We are alone in this house. This is indecent. Get out, Yamada. But it's more dangerous if you're alone. Who will help you if something happens? Fine, but keep the door open. Okay. Are you cold? You have a fever? Have you taken any medicine? Let me buy some. Yamada, you don't need to. I have some medicine here. Why are you sick? Have you eaten? You ate so little. If you have a fever, you should eat something hot. What do you have in the fridge? Wait here. I can cook something for you. Please wait. Here you go. Is it good? You're being nice to me for a reason, right? Of course there's a reason. Kidding. When you get better, how about we go for another walk? Yours says that your true love or match is near you at this moment. Really. It's true. I'm serious. That's so like you. So, you chose to work outside the office so you could be free? Something like that. You can say that. Maybe you are better off living in Indonesia, not here. Not necessarily. I'm just more compatible with Indonesian women. Yeah, right. How about you, Viona? Like most Indonesians, I'm tired of seeing the lack of discipline, chaos. Every day I see poverty. So for me, Japan is like my dream country. - That's too bad. - Why? If you like living in Japan better and I'm more suited to living in Indonesia... then when will we meet? Viona, come on, hurry up! I have to show you something. Come on! Are you cold? Your jacket doesn't have any pockets? Give it to me. Your hand. Is it warmer? I prefer Dragon Ball. Do you know that? Dragon Ball, Ultraman. I'm certain. If you wear an oversized kimono... Nice to meet you. I'm Yamada. I'm Hasan. Nice to meet you, too. Hasan... I will be going now. Good night. Good night. Excuse me. Viona. Viona! No, leave it, San! It's already clean. Who do you think you are? Coming here without permission. I want to apologize. For what? When we were in Dotombori... So it was really you? Yes. I was very surprised. I couldn't believe that it was really you. - And I wasn't ready to see you. - Why weren't you ready yet? Because you didn't want to see me. - No... - It's been months, San. Avoiding me. Never communicating. And you still won't admit that you didn't want to see me? - Forget about it, San. I'm tired. - I have my reasons. I don't need that. I just need to know that you're okay. I'm tired, San. You should leave. I don't care if it's another year or two. I'm not your fiancée, not even your girlfriend. - I don't have to ask anything from you. - Viona. Put them first. And finally, add wasabi. - I'm home. - Welcome home. This must be Viona. Am I right, Satoshi? My son always told me that this Viona is a pretty girl. Please come in. Come on. Thank you. You can choose, Viona. Thank you. - We met in Tokyo. - Yes. There was an event held by Indonesian students. - You gave a speech, right? - Right, a speech. Yeah. And then there was a dinner party. - And he approached me. - Yeah, she was the prettiest girl. You're still pretty. Come on. This orenji plantation belongs to my family. I used to play around this area and over there. This is my favorite spot. "Orenji." What does orenji really mean to the Japanese? Orenji is... When a family come together while eating orenji, it's like a symbol of warmth. - Can I pick one? - Take a hundred if you want. Let me pick one. You can pick this one. Be careful. Try it. - Why? - So sour! Really? Well, it looks good on the outside, but the inside can sometimes be sour. So don't be fooled by appearances. This plantation has been my family's for almost 20 years. From my grandfather to my father. Look over there. Viona, you want to know what I prayed for? Tell me. I prayed for God to bless our relationship. Viona, do you want to... be my wife someday? - Are you serious? - I'm serious. This is too fast. Let's go home. It's getting late. San? Can we meet? Yamada proposed to me. Congratulations. If you marry him, that will be a big leap in achieving your goals. Not only are you studying and working in Japan, you can become a Japanese citizen. How about you? I'm happy if you are happy. But please make sure for the sake of your children that he wants to convert to Islam. Goodbye, San. What should I do? In this case, use this leg, and put this leg inside here, and lift your leg up quickly. Then... - Like that! - I understand. You're really good. Hello, Viona. Yamada. If I accept your proposal, that means we'll get married, right? Where do you want to get married? There's a wedding venue. Why Kyoto? They have complete facilities. And there are priests who can guide our marriage. Priest? You... What is your religion? Today, many Japanese are born Shinto, and they marry as Christians, and die as Buddhists. But I can't. I'm a Muslim. There are strict laws for marriage in my religion. In that case, teach me Islam. Please help me and guide me. So that I can... embrace your religion. - This is good for you. - "Worship Guide." Good afternoon. Do I look good? So I look good now? It's okay, Mom. How are you, by the way? All right, fine. Peace be upon you. Where are you going, Aning? Out. Where are you going tonight? Kobe. Kobe? That's really far from here. With Yamada? Ona, you're a flirt. Where are you both going in Kobe? To the mosque. Mosque? What for? Yamada wants to convert. Yamada? Convert? Yamada wants to convert to Islam? He wants to marry you? Oh, my God, Ona! Congratulations! You left Bandung and got yourself a Japanese man! Ouch, that hurts. What's wrong? Nothing. Are you nervous? - Yes, Aning? - Have you gone far? - Not yet. - You better come back now. What's wrong? Just come home now. What's wrong? - Ona. - What is it? Oh, yeah. There's a package from Hasan, but I don't know who delivered it. - It was at the door. - Is it in my room now? Yes, in your room. IS THIS YOUR DREAM RING? It's a nice ring. It has a diamond. Small, but just right. I want a ring just like that when I get married. Is something wrong? Viona. Actually... when I decided to convert, I was full of doubt. I really don't know what I'm doing. I just did everything to make you want to be my wife. And then I realized that all this time I was wrong. Religion... is not something to be played with. I am really sorry. Hasan... is a great man. He... He is an amazing person. If I were in the same position as him, I'm not sure I would be as strong. I should have... never gotten between you two. He... is the more suitable man to be your husband. Hasan. Ever since Dad died, you know Mom went in and out of the hospital, but nobody could figure out her illness. Until last year's incident. Her condition got worse because of too many drugs. What I've never told you is... You can see for yourself. The business is very slow. I'll tell you what. I'll give you one week. You pay all your debts, plus interest. - I can't do that in a week! - Not my problem. Hey, Hasan. Do you want to know how to make a lot of money? How? Sell Viona. - Offer her to the bosses. - That's a great idea! Watch your mouth! We gave you a chance. Be thankful! Don't you dare! You already know Burhan is not a good guy. Yet you still go to him. Who could I have ask for help? To pay 100 million rupiah in hospital bills? What do you want now? I need to ask you a favor. Send me to Japan. After that, I got into a lot of debt... that the auto shop wasn't able to pay off. It barely had enough for daily operations. So I moved to Japan. Just like we used to dream of. Japan is synonymous with a better future. It's more beautiful. Until now, I still feel devastated because it turns out all the jobs I got were just labor jobs. Manual labor. For me... the greatness of Japan is far beyond my reach. What I am experiencing are the sour and bitter parts of it. Orenji. They look sweet on the outside. But not necessarily on the inside. You're right. Orenji. I'm not so different from you, San. I also do manual work. But the difference is I'm doing this all for my dream. It's for my master's degree. We can do it. Let's cheer up. We can do it! Can I ask you something? Of course you can. You don't have to ask. Is your big dream only to get your master's here? How dare you? That's not a small thing. No, I mean... - I also have a big dream. - What is it, San? To get my master's here. That's amazing, Hasan! And to stay here with you. - That's impossible. - Why? - It's impossible. - Because we aren't married? Well, it could be possible... if you become the mother of my children. Would you like that? Would you like that? God willing, San.
