We're chasing dreams without end in a world without a guide. These overlapping feelings pierce the beating of my heart as the unwavering verse quietly goes on. From far away in the sky, our shadows blur together as our memories are recorded amid inevitability and whimsy. Even if the whirlpools of time we pass through, were to waste away, I'll still believe in your voice. We're chasing dreams without end in a future without a guide. And even if I lose my light, someday, with the twinkling flame you lit in my heart, these fragments of hope will change into wings Sometimes, people forget about the courage it takes to live. But as long as people believe in something in their hearts, courage will never disappear completely. Someone is calling me... "God's Favored Daughter" Syaoran-kun... I'm okay. For the feudal lord to be able to beat you, Syaoran-kun, he must have a fairly formidable hijutsu. The lord and his son use that power to control the town. Still, there are only two of them. If everyone in town ganged up on them, you should be able to take them. Of course, we've tried. Half a year ago, the townspeople joined forces and tried to put those two down. But the lord's castle has his hijutsu cast around it, and nobody could get near it. So that's it. That hijutsu must be the mysterious power that Mokona mentioned. A whole lot of mysterious power, and I can't make out the feather's wavelength very well. If you can't get inside the castle, you could just wait until the lord comes out of it. The lord never comes out of the castle. Then, what about his son? Suppose you took him hostage? Hostage, you say? That was sort of a dark thing you just said, huh? That won't work, either. He watches over the whole town with his hijutsu. So you'd be attacked by the wind, like Syaoran-kun was yesterday. Then it has to be storming the castle. Which means, it's vital that you have a leader. Without someone who knows how to fight to lead you, the castle will never fall, no matter how much you attack it. There's no way we have anyone that good at fighting here in town. Sure you do, right here. You'd do that for us? I guess. Kuro-pon, that's unusually cooperative of you, huh? By any chance, have you grown tired of that? Of course I have. You can fix the roof by yourself! I've made up my mind to attack the lord's castle. First, we'll need some soldiers. Leave that to me. I know where we can find some. Father, it looks like that little girl is plotting something again. The castle's defenses are seamless. Let her be. Still, why do we need to let Cyunyan live? I was thinking of making the girl your wife someday. You were what!? Cyunyan has the makings to become an even greater practitioner of the arts than her mother was. My thinking was that the quickest way to bring that power into our family is to have her become your wife... ...but with this, that probably won't be necessary any longer. Heh, I'm relieved to hear that. In time, we will afford Cyunyan her death, just as we did her mother. Then, mother and daughter... ...can live together happily in the next life. What is this place? You'll see once you go inside. Go on. Don't worry, these are my guests. What's going on? This is the secret gathering place for the courageous among the townspeople, who do not approve of the lord's rule, and have secretly resolved to fight him. Is that Cyunyan's voice I hear? I-it's you! Sorata and Arashi! It's been so long. You guys know them? No, this is the first time I've ever seen them. Me, too. What is that thing? I'm not "that thing," I'm Mo-ko-na. M-Mokona? He may have a strange appearance, but he's also one of my guests. Are you two in love-love? L-love-love? You both are fond of each other, right? No, I wouldn't say... Someday, we plan on being husband and wife. W-we do? Don't we? S-sure we do...mm-hmm... I knew it! Never mind that, I need a favor. So in other words, the couple that we know and those two people... ...have the same souls, but in this world, they have been living different lives. Do you understand, Princess? More or less. You're giving up fighting? But why? Don't say that, Cyunyan. But! That was the outcome of what we all discussed with each other. We were defeated soundly in that fight a half year ago. W-what is this? We're just no match for his hijutsu, and so... ...and so, I hate to say this, but we can't afford to have any more casualties. But! Cyunyan... I have to go... Fine... M-Mother! It's no use, Cyunyan. Your mother is already dead. It's not true! I will not even permit condolences toward those who defy me. Mother! Your mother's soul will not be called home to Heaven, nor will it find rest in the earth, but will wander for eternity in a barren otherworld! Mother! Mother! Mother! Now, all those who would impede me are gone. This town is now mine! I need power. A strong power, so that I may avenge my mother. Cyunyan, there you are. I'm sorry we couldn't be any help. Because of our defeat a half year ago, everyone has lost the courage to fight. Please understand. I... ...have to go. Princess! -What's the matter, Princess? -What's the matter? Sakura! Don't! Sakura! Stop! Once you go through the gate, you can never return! Sakura! Syaoran, don't go! I'm sorry, Syaoran. If you had gone, the townspeople would suffer again. We can't have any more victims. I know. Still... ...I am going. And... ...I will be sure to bring Sakura back here. Syaoran... There are eight castle gates in all, huh? We'll have to break our way through one of them. Hey! What are you being so lazy for!? If you're going to hit it, then hit it! If you're going to complain, Kuro-pon, then why don't you do it? You've gotta be kidding me. You think I'd fix the roof over storming a castle? Hijutsu, huh? So that's it. Bad news! Bad news! It's Syaoran and Sakura! Did something happen to the two of them? That kid would do something on his own before I could storm the castle. The hijutsu that has been cast over the castle is stronger than I thought. Once you go inside the gate, you can never come out again. What? Then, are they? Princess! If you can hear me, please answer! Syaoran-kun! Princess! Princess! Princess... Princess! Syaoran-kun... Princess, I'm coming now! All right then, shall we begin? First, the torture of hellfire. Princess! And now, the torture of stone. H- help me! Princess! Syaoran-kun! You're okay now, Princess. Syaoran-kun... Now then, which torture shall I send them next? Father! What's the matter? What have we here? Cyunyan has been saying some funny things, and getting the people in town together. Funny things? Cyunyan, stop talking nonsense. No one who has been drawn inside the gate has ever come back. Sakura is one of God's favored daughters, so she's sure to come back. Do you think that what Cyunyan is saying is true? I don't know. I don't know, but if it is true... Princess! Syaoran-kun! Princess! Princess Sakura! Wait... You poor thing... So, our voices reached you, did they? Thank goodness you've realized who we are. They're all people from town. What? Since then, as they've been living in this otherworld, before they knew it, they had taken on these forms. Is that right? But don't worry. Once the hijutsu is lifted, I'm sure you'll get your original forms back. You, who were able to touch these people without a second thought, despite their horrifying appearances, are indeed one of God's favored daughters. Beloved daughter of God, now, go forth. Return back to the place where you belong, together with the one you love. Princess! Is that? Syaoran! And Sakura-chan is with him. T-they came back! Yes. Just like Cyunyan said they would! That girl is one of God's favored daughters! I had faith that you'd return! Why, those! How did they get out of there!? It appears that that group of people are not ordinary folk. Now that it's come to this... So, we're not storming the castle after all, huh? That's no fun. Still, it looks like the mood of the townspeople has changed a little. So if we defeat the lord, our friends who were drawn inside the gate will come back, right? That's right. Now that we know that, we can't very well give up fighting, can we? You mean? It will take some time to convince everyone, but just you wait. Now, awaken, my despicable, evil princess. My name...is Kiishimu. You know, when this town is bathed in twilight, there will be a little seed that drops from your hand. If you can call this trodden-down dirt a road, does closing my eyes count as love? If this world had been flat, the two of us would never have met. We were both running to keep our distance. But now, without reducing speed, no matter how far apart we are, as the miracle repeats itself, we will come face to face again. We will come face to face again.
