[waves lapping] [pants] -[gunfire] -[shouts] [ominous music] [phone ringing] St. Braddan's. Mullin speaking. [raining] [dramatic music] [music continues] [engine humming] [heels clicking] [beeping] [door closes] Do you remember me, Mrs. St. Clair? You, uh, came to see me that night. Can you hear me? Squeeze my hand if you can hear me. That's good. Very good. You'd like me to hear your confession if you wish God's forgiveness for your sin, just squeeze my hand. [inhales] Heaven or hell, Father, I don't care. All I want to know is if I was right. Please, let me speak. [dramatic music] [people murmur] [Kristie] I met Marc in '91. There he was smiling at me, handsome, well-educated with an irresistible British accent. He promised me the world. [man] But there's one thing I know for certain. You will be as happy here as we are. Welcome to the family. [people applauding] [Kristie] I left the States. And eight months later we got married. Jack and Elizabeth Plummer, the owners of Marc's TV station, hosted our wedding. It was a perfect all American girls' dream. I was so naive, Father. It was close to midnight when Marc asked me for a little romantic walk under the stars. [Marc] Mmm, full moon. -Great for fertility. -What a coincidence. [chuckles] No, no, no. Planning, darling. Years of planning. [kisses] [people speaking] [chuckling] Where are you leading me to? [Marc chuckles] Don't worry. It's not far. [branches rustling] [Kristie] Something was wrong out there. It was in the air around us, watching us from the treetops, lurking between those immense rocks. If evil has a scent, I could smell it that night. [voices whispering] [wings rustling] [thunder rolling] Marc, this place scares me. [kisses] [moaning] Marc. [dramatic music] [lightning strikes] [thunder rolling] I got pregnant that night, Father. It didn't feel right, but Marc and I never talked about it again. [beeping] Jack Plummer's new TV show made Marc famous all over the island. And I was to be its happiest mother. [Kristie] Two fireplaces. A winter garden. I've chosen the most beautiful fabric. [Lynnie] Oh, Jesus Christ, Kristie. -You sound like Laura Ashley on acid. -[both laughing] -[dog barking] -When will you move in? Well, very gradually because we want to do as much as we can ourselves, but... ...first I have to get Dylan out of his diapers. Uh, first of all, you've got to squeeze him enough. -That's the part that scares the shit out of me. -Oh, you'll be fine. I mean, look at you. How can a single girl get so lucky? Oh... Oh my God, Kristie, are you alright? Yeah. [panting] Yeah, I think... I think he's just kicking. -Oh, Oh my God. -Oh, shit. Okay. I think this is it. You gotta page Marc. -[Kristie groaning] -Baxter, get down. -Oh my God. [groans] -It's gonna be fine. -I believe in sex life. -So much about local myths and legends. Thank you. [sighs] Oh my God, this is it. I've got to run. I'm gonna be the proudest daddy of all time. -Wish me luck. -[chuckles] [applause] There goes the dad to be. -And now on to the weather. -Are you sure he got the page? He would have been here by now if he got the page. I've been trying and trying. I called the studio, but nobody knows where-- Something must have happened. [groaning] [reporter indistinct] ...for a special report. [TV presenter] Samuel, six year old son of our station's owners, Jack and Elizabeth Plummer, is missing. He did not come home from school today. If you have any information as to his whereabouts, please contact your nearest police station. [suspenseful music] [door creaking] [Kristie shouting] Inverted. When the hell did this child invert? -His position was fine before. -[Kristie shouting] [shouting continues] -Come on, Mrs... [indistinct] -[nurse] The baby's causing the birth canal. [doctor] Watch the strangulation. [nurse] Shh. You're doing very well. That's it. You're gonna be okay. [shouting] [baby crying] It's a healthy little boy, Mrs. St. Clair. [crow croaks] I'm so sorry I couldn't be here for you, my love. [sighs] I'm afraid something happened. Little Sammy. He didn't come home from school. We're looking all over the island. Oh my God, did they find him? [baby cooing] I'm sure he'll be fine. I'm just glad that you and Dylan made it through okay. [Kristie] Sammy Plummer was found dead murdered by some unknown psycho. Dylan was strong and healthy and I felt guilty around Jack and Elizabeth because what followed turned out to be the happiest time of my life. [warm music] -[baby cooing] -Hello, superstar. -Hello, sweetheart. -[laughing] ♪ And the rain falls on me ♪ This is the stuff. Oh, look at that. [laughing] ♪ There's a lantern that's burning bright ♪ Hey! ♪ ...moon shining in your eyes ♪ [Kristie laughing] Well done. ♪ Till I'm in your heart ♪ ♪ It's like heaven opens, opens the doors ♪ ♪ I've never been so high before ♪ ♪ It's like heaven opens, opens the doors to me ♪ [laughing] ♪ When the sun's waking up the sky ♪ [indistinct speech] Hey. How's my dream team, yeah? [groans] I'm wet. Careful with that camera. Your son's a hell of a sniper. [laughs] Well, a war journalist has to face the danger. [Kristie laughs] Where did this come from? -It's itchy. -Mm. Must be oxidizing or something. It's giving him a rash. [Kristie] So you look at two cards and if they're the same, then you go again. But if they're different, then it's my turn. All right? [cards rustling] Your turn. Nice. It must be our lucky day. -[car beeps] -[Dylan] Easy game. Aunt Elizabeth! [gates creaking] Marc? Did you see that? Certainly did. -Lucky bastard. [kisses] -[dog barking] [Kristie sighs] Another present. I don't think she can help herself, darling. He's almost the same age now as Sammy was when they lost him. [Kristie] Seeing Elizabeth close to my son always made me feel uneasy. I was in her way and she was about to take care of that. Kristie, the business is expanding much faster than we thought it would. We desperately need a talented executive. You're offering me a job? It's time to think about the future. Kristie St. Clair, president of Advertising sales. Sounds rather fabulous, doesn't it? It does. I just don't know if I am ready. Get off, that's my swing. You've done your time. Let Marc take the wait for a while. It's just that I haven't been away from Dylan since he was born. -I said, get off! -Come on. Five star hotels, first class travel, first class food. How bad can it be? Look, you've got a fantastic husband willing to stay at home -and let you have a life. -[girl singing] Take advantage of it. [singing continues] [swing creaking] [suspenseful music] Okay, okay. -[girl gasps] -[chain jingling] -Are you all right? -Mommy! Why did you do that? Because she was about to get hurt, sweetheart. I know. [suspenseful music] [guinea pig screaming] [Kristie] I should have known by then, Father. I talked to Marc about it... ...and all he said was that kids are like that. That they have no idea about death. For them, everything is a game. My God, you should have seen his eyes. [light dramatic music] [Kristie] I accepted the job in London. Elizabeth made me go through an endless row of sales meetings, in flight meals and hotel rooms. I missed Dylan more than anything. By the time it was Christmas, I knew I had to make a choice. Check out the graph on page four to see how the numbers just go out the window during the finals. -Kris. -Yeah. You're gonna hate me. -Why? -[indistinct] I'm afraid you're gonna have to finish off with these guys by yourself. I can't, I have a flight in two hours. I'll call the office. They'll book you on the 4:30. Good luck. [dramatic music] I'm sorry. Mrs. St. Clair, but I cannot find your reservation. Please look again. My office must have called. I'm afraid you're not on this flight and it's fully booked. [scoffs] You said you'd take care of it, Elizabeth. Now I have to spend Christmas Eve in a stupid airport hotel. [Kristie on the phone] Can you imagine how pissed I am? Darling, calm down. -It must have been a mix up. -I promised Dylan. -I-- I've got all his presents. -He'll be fine. Believe me. He'll know it's not your fault. Have a drink. Sleep it off. Tomorrow everything will be different. Merry Christmas. [beeps] [hangs up] [Kristie] I'm so sorry, Dyl. I'm going to take the first plane out in the morning, and if I can, maybe I'll meet Santa Claus-- -Get off. -[dog whines] What was that? Dylan... -Tell her you miss her. -Miss you, mother. Mother? Well, I miss you too, sir. -Can you pass me to your father? -Dad? Hello, darling. -Is he all right? -Oh, he's fine. I think he wishes his mommy was here. Well, thanks for making me feel better. [doorbell rings] -Are you expecting somebody? -No-no. -Probably just the neighbors. -[wine pouring] Ah. You two have fun. Bye, darling. -[beeps] -Bye. [hangs up] [door opens] [ominous music] We brought you a present, Dylan. [clock ticking] [light dramatic music] [paper rustling] It was given to me... when I was your age. You know what we've got to do... ...don't you? Will it hurt? Yes, a good deal. But after tonight... ...you won't be like other little boys... ...you will be able to do things they can't. [door opens] You're not my Father. No, I'm not. [loud scream] [switch clicks] [phone ringing] [dial tone] [hangs up] [phone ringing] [voicemail] Hi, this is Lynnie. I'm not here, but if you leave your name number and inseam size I'll probably call you back. [Kristie] Hey, Lenny, you really ought to change that message. I-- I'm stuck in London. I tried to call Marc. He's not picking up and I'm just really worried. So when you get home, I'd appreciate it if you'd run over and make sure everything's okay. -Thank you. -[picks up the phone] [hangs up] Shit! [rewinds the tape] [engine humming] [Kristie] As the morning plane brought me back to the island, I could still feel the cold grip of my nightmare. And deep inside I knew something was terribly wrong. I was yearning to come home a home. A home that would never be the same again. -[door slams shut] -Thanks for the help. [engine starts] [rock music] You like my collection? That is Christopher, see? Oh, and here's Mary! Look at her, huh? She was a pagan. Never even heard about the Holy Ghost until he came down and shagged her. But let me ask you this, -just in theory... -[lighter clicks] ...Holy Ghost has his turn, right? Sends Jesus down to Earth. And 2000 years later, the Devil wants to have a try, so he's going to need a virgin. Just like Mary, right? Do you think he's going to ask the woman before he bunks her? I mean he's the devil, isn't he? Holy Ghost don't ask. So why should he? The reason I'm telling you, Mrs. St. Clair... How do you know my name? ...it's already happened. Remember the night you conceived your son? Stop the car. I heard he's got a big heart for guinea pigs. Stop the car. [door opens] [door slams shut] [trunk opens] [trunk shuts] [rock music playing on radio] What? Only you can stop them. Remember that, Kristie. [door slams shut] [engine humming] [Kristie] That Bible bashing driver gave me the creeps. All that rubbish about Mary. -[door closes] -Hello? When I finally arrived at home, the prospect of a hot bath seemed like heaven to me. But the house was cold and deserted. [dog whining] Jesus Christ. [continues whining] Oh my God. What happened? Huh? -Hi, Mom. -[dog whining] Marc, did you do this to him? You're damn right, I did. What the hell is wrong with you? He bit our child, Kris. It hurt, Mom. With both hands? We want the dog put down. Either you do it, or I will. [soft music] [door closes] No way. Lynnie? [dog barking] [knocks on the door] Lynnie? Hello? Baxter. Hey. Baxter, come here. Come here, boy. [licking] Hey. What are you doing? Hey. [blood dripping] [screaming] [intense music] We're operating on the assumption that the murder... ...was a crime of passion. Miss Peterson might have just let the wrong person into her home. You'll have more as we get it. Thank you. [Marc] A genuine tragedy for the island. And one that hits close to home. Lynette Peterson was a good friend of my wife and myself. She babysat for our child. We will miss you, Lynnie. Einnyl uoy ssim. -[sighs] What? -Miss you, Lynnie. [explosions] [explosions] Do you understand that she's dead, Dylan? -Yep. -[explosions] You'll never see her again. Yep. Look, you don't laugh and play violent games when someone you love dies. [explosions continue] Hey, are you listening to me? Hey, I don't want you playing right now. I don't care what you want. [phone ringing] Woof. Woof. [phone continues ringing] -Hello? -[man] Mrs. St. Clair? Hello, this is Mr. Barton from the veterinary surgery. We've put your dog down. The cremation will be tomorrow evening. Uh, your husband didn't mention how you want us to proceed with the... [Kristie] Marc had just done it. Without even asking me. He was worried about Dylan's safety and I couldn't blame him for that. God, how I miss Lynnie. My only friend. [man] You're wasting your time, Kristie. You can pray for 1000 years and nothing will ever happen. And why is that so? Mr. Taxi Driver? You can call me Cormac. All right. What do you want from me, Cormac? Nothing. I watch... ...and I listen. And if things don't quite fit together... ...I wonder. That's all. For example, that dog of yours, Kristie... ...never was a biter, was he? And through both hands at once. [lighter clicks] So I'm thinking... ...what could your husband have done to the hands of your little boy? And you know what? I found... ...that there are a very... ...limited number of possibilities. You're sick. Hey. Wait a minute. Remember what I told you about Mary? No one ever told her... ...it's time someone tells you. [dramatic music] [tense music] [engine humming] [Kristie] I called the university and they recommended a certain professor who was said to read his morning paper in Celtic. [professor] It seems to talk about Nemhain, also known as Morrigan, the Celtic Goddess of death. See the raven? That's her. Now look at this. A fallen angel. Your text is most likely a forgery, but if you want me to, I can have a closer look at it. How long will that take? I'll have to carbon date the parchment, a couple of days. Unless if I can possibly persuade you to join me for a beer. [TV presenter] Well, it better be good. -Otherwise... -It's on me. [Marc] Uh, without further ado, please welcome Mr. Dylan St. Clair. [applause] Hello, Dylan. Sit down. Nice to have you on the show. Now, of course, camera two. I'm sure you'll all be wondering where he got those good looks from? [laughing] -Dad... -There you are. He's talking backwards already. -D-A-D. "Dad." -Impressive. -Evisserpmi. -What? It's "impressive" backwards. Oh, come on, Shell. -Can someone get him a coffee? -Cue laughter. And camera three. Can you say "talking backwards" backwards? -Sdrawkcab gniklat. -[applause] Shit. Not bad. [Marc] And now then, Dylan, let's think of something else for you to say. Uh, do you know any Shakespeare, Shelly? Now is the winter of our discontent. Tnetnocsid ruo fo retniw eht si won. [Marc] Um, Laura, can we-- can we see that in reverse please? -[tape rewound] -Now is the winter of our discontent. Tnetnocsid ruo fo retniw eht si won. Amazing boy. I'd be happy if my students knew their text forwards. I'm so sorry, I really have to go. It's very urgent. But I will call you tomorrow. That's what they always say. It's been a pleasure meeting you. Yes. You too. [Marc] ...all round the studio. Ready? [Dylan reads a spell] [reads a spell] [reads a spell] [whispering] Stars hide your fire. Let not see light, my black and deep desire. [echo] Desire, desire, desire... [tires rustling] [Marc] They are running it nationally on Talk Soup tonight. -Here's Elizabeth. -Oh, my broadcasting's gonna be golden. Yeah. Talk to you later. What the hell is going on here? There you are. [hangs up] My son is leverage? Did you see me on TV, Mom? Why didn't you tell me you were going to put him on the show? [laughs] What? Well, he's our son, Marc, not some sideshow freak, -and he doesn't drink champagne! -Calm down. It's apple juice. And I did tell you. -When? -We had a long talk on the phone, you were fine about it then. What are you talking about? I don't remember anything about this. Beg your pardon, Kristie, but you and I spoke about it as well. And it is part of your job too. My job is not about exploiting my son for ad revenue. And how could you and I have discussed this, Elizabeth? I've never even heard him talk backwards. Einnyl uoy ssim. I miss you, Lynnie. Remember, Mom? You taught me that one. Holy shite. Well, who's going to believe this, that story? -[buttons clicking] -What the-- [loud crash] Hello? Anyone there? [suspenseful music] [gas hissing] We heard... the calling. [indistinct speech] Mr. St. Clair. -Hello? -Can I have an autograph? Of course. -What's your name? -Not you. Dylan. -Can he send it to me? -[laughs] Yes. Yes, of course, he can. Write down your name and address. That's very kind of you, Mr. St. Clair. -It's my pleasure. -Your son is gorgeous. Such a-- such a smart and charming child. Something about him, um, his eyes look straight into people's hearts. Half the country are watching on Talk Soup tonight. [chuckles] Oh, but you must excuse me. I-- I'm stealing your time. Let's go back to Daddy. See? People like him. He's so young, Marc. Much older than he seems. Believe me. [Kristie sighs] You would never do anything to hurt me or Dylan, would you? [chuckles] Of course not. Never. [tires rustling] -[car door closes] -[Marc laughing] [laughing continues] [knocks on the door] [knocks on the door] [knocks on the door] [knocks getting louder] [knocks continue] [wind blows] [door creaking] [eerie music] [door bangs] [clock ticking] [sighs] [ball strikes] [Kristie] Seeing them together like this opened my eyes. Elizabeth had already replaced me. She planned this for a long time. But I wasn't gonna make it that easy for her. Okay, so I just have to do a couple of things. And then when we can get some ice cream, how does that sound? -Is Dad not coming with us? -No, Dad's got to work. How about Aunt Elizabeth? She's not your aunt. You're staying with me today. Is that so bad having to spend the day with your mother? Hey... ...are you mad at me because I go away a lot? No, dad's always there. Angel? Has anything weird ever happened with Dad? Like what? Has he ever done anything... ...to scare you? Like with your hands. Did he-- Did Baxter really bite you? Dylan, I want you to look at me and tell me if anything bad has ever happened with your father. [suspenseful music] You don't even know my father. -[loud bang] -[Kristie screams] [car door opens] [dramatic music] Look. [Kristie] Professor Biden's body was never found... ...and I knew no one was ever going to believe me. -[door opens] -So, I decided to visit a man I barely knew more about than a name and an address. You had a rough day, huh? -[loud bang] -Hey, be careful, will you? It's nearly 2000 years old. What does it say? Why should I tell you? You wouldn't believe me anyway. -[lighter clicks] -Because the last man I asked is dead. [lighter clicks] My only friend is dead. But that's not even why I'm here. [sighs] How can I save my son? [exhales] Please, I beg of you. If you have anything to tell me, do it now. This describes the coming of Christ. Promises us the ring of a loving God. And what did we get? Inquisition, genocide. All kinds of nasty stuff. Anyway... ...there was... another book... ...but I can't tell you much about that one. It got lost. That's what's left of it. Let's look at it as a contract. The rules of the game. A woman... ...will bear a child... ...fostered by those who took the heart of their first born. Leading them who hear the calling. There will be plenty. You're that woman, Kristie. You got pregnant on your wedding night... ...and certainly not by your husband. And you know it, Kristie. You know who his father is. This is crazy. On the very day your son was born... ...your husband killed a child. His firstborn. Dylan is Marc's firstborn? Dylan is not even his son. He cut Sammy Plummer's heart out. Sammy was strangled. Marc himself reported it from the murder site. That changes everything. [dramatic music] [tires rustling] [Kristie] I didn't believe a word, but I had to be sure... ...the proof was somewhere on those tapes that have been recorded eight years ago. So I went to the station. But what I'd find was not the kind of certainty I'd been looking for. [Marc] It was a nightmare that came without a warning. A crime that lasted mere moments. Today, Jack and Elizabeth Plummer, the owners of this station, confirmed that the body found in the buildings behind me was indeed that of their only son. Samuel John Plummer would be missing since April the 21st. Detective Oliver Morton stated that the boy had been the victim of a ritual murder. Apparently his... Cut. Um, sorry. Sorry. Cut, cut, cut. It's, um... It's too much. I... ...I can't talk about Sammy's heart being cut out. Um, I'm sorry. What exactly are you doing? -[loud click] -Jesus Christ. You scared the shit out of me. I called the station. They said you were in the tape vault. What are you doing down here? I have, uh, have a clients meeting tomorrow. Just getting some numbers off some tapes. -Where's Dylan? -In the car. Those numbers are already logged, Kris. You don't need to watch a tape to get the numbers. What have you got here? Nothing. [computer starts] Can we go home? I didn't realize how late it was. [tape rewound] ...Sammy's heart being cut out. Why did you tell me he was strangled? [clicks the button] [sighs] Jesus, Kristie. You'd just given birth. I didn't want to put any more strain on you. You know, there's nothing you could have done anyway. Was Sammy your son? [laughs] What? -Oh, come on. -Did you sleep with Elizabeth? No. Jesus, Kristie. -What are you talking about? -Stop lying to me! [loud bang] [dramatic music] Come with me. Come, come, come. What are you doing? Shh. Get in there. [door closes] [door opens] Where's Dad? -Dylan. Dylan, open the door. -Daddy! -Dylan, stop it! -Kristie, please! Dylan, Dylan! Daddy! Dylan! Dad! -Where are we going? -Buckle your seatbelt. No, I want to be with Dad. Want to be with Dad! [shouts] Dylan, I said buckle your seatbelt! [seatbelt clicks] We are going to a place where they'll help us. No, I'm not going anywhere with you. -Dad doesn't want you to. -I don't care what Dad wants! -Dylan. -[tires skidding] [loud crash] [door creaking] Good Lord, what happened? Save my child, Father. He needs a doctor, not a priest. I know what he needs. [panting] Please, baptize my son. For God's sake, lay him down. This is Father Mullin in St. Braddan's. I've got an injured boy here. I need an ambulance. No, no, no. I'm not sure what happened. Car crash, I think. You might send the police as well. Oh God, forgive me. -Mom? -Angel? I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I will never let any of those people near you again. [sobbing] It's upside down, mom. There's nothing to be scared of in here. [breathes heavily] [air whooshing] [suspenseful music] [screaming] [screaming continues] Let him go, Mrs. St. Clair. You held my son from a cross. Him and Elizabeth Plummer sacrificed their own child! You're delirious, ma'am. And you've hurt your boy. Now, I need you to give him to his father. [dramatic music] Father, please help me. Don't let them take him. -[shouts] No, no! -Daddy! [shouts] No! -No. [cries] -Kristie. You need help. [shouts] No! [sobbing] [continues sobbing] [raining] You remember that night, don't you, Father? You saw what happened. You saw what he did. The Book of Revelations is about the coming of the Antichrist, is it not? Of course it is. And what does it say about the false prophet? It's thought to be the voice. The mouthpiece of the Antichrist. Can you think of a bigger mouthpiece than that? [TV news jingle] [crowd cheering] [indistinct speech] -[explosion] -[man speaking in foreign language] The world is very different. [explosion] [light dramatic music] [Kristie] Marc moved with Dylan to Elizabeth's. The papers were full of it. Even on the Mainland. Finally, there was no one on the whole island who wasn't convinced that I was mad. And slowly, I began to doubt myself. That's a big horse for a little guy. Dylan, walk him out. [horse neighing] [door opens] I don't want to go to court over Dylan. I want him back. I want you back. I want a family back. And I don't know what possessed me that night. But I know I'm better because I know it was crazy. And I miss you. I really, really miss you. The last time I saw you... ...you accused me of some horrible things. You almost killed my son. No, he's our sun. That's kind of the issue. Isn't it? [horse stomping] If you won't talk to me, at least let me speak with Dylan. Talk to him now if you want. I'm not leaving my son. Jesus Christ, Marc, I'm his mother. I'm not going to hurt him. [screams] Dylan, what are you doing? -Stop! -Dylan, stop it. You know, Kristie. I'd leave. [horse stomping] [somber music] [Kristie] He filed for sole custody of Dylan. Even if I'd had a chance to contest his claim, how could I force my son to live with me? He hated me. My life was shattered. And even worse, everything seemed to be my own fault. Happy birthday, Dylan. I decided to go back to the States. [door closes] It broke my heart, but I had to do what was best for Dylan. But then a tiny object turned my world upside down. [lock clicks] [door creaking] Lynette's earring. And suddenly all of the pieces fell into place. [Lynnie] Hello, Kris? Oh, shit. [voicemail beeps] I'm just really worried. When you get home, I'd appreciate it if you'd run over and make sure everything's okay. Marc, where's the little prince? I've got a prezzie for him. -Marc? -We're operating on the assumption that the murder was a crime of passion. Miss Peterson might have just let the wrong person into-- [Marc] A genuine tragedy for the island. And one that hits close to home. Lynette Peterson was a good friend of my wife and myself. She babysat for our child. We will miss you, Lynn. [Dylan] I ssim uoy einnyl. I miss you, Lynnie. Remember, Mom? You taught me that one. Do you understand that she's dead, Dylan? Yep. [loud bangs] That you'll never see her again. Yep. [bangs continue] [door opening] [dramatic music] [music continues] [nails jingling] [panting] [groans] [clatters] [groaning] [groaning continues] -[loud bang] -[flesh squelching] It's a perfect match. They're unique. I gave them to her. Could she have lost it on a different occasion? Look, the earing's been ripped off. There's blood. Kristie, this doesn't prove anything. -Except that-- -What are you, blind? It's evidence. All right. I'll look into this... again. Right after the holiday. That's not good enough. Something is gonna happen tonight. They're having a party for Dylan. I know this must be hard for you. You wouldn't be a mother if you didn't want to be with him. But believe me... ...there is nothing to worry about. You honestly believe there is nothing to worry about? Absolutely. Now... [paper rustling] ...I'll keep you informed. [dramatic music] [door opens] [door slams shut] [trunk opens] [Kristie] Suddenly, everything Cormac had told me seemed to be true. I had no plan, Father... ...but I knew one thing... ...I had to get Dylan out of there... ...and there was not much time to lose. [electronic music] [music continues] [women laughing] [women moaning] [women moaning] [music continues] [music fades] Happy Birthday, Dylan. Thank you. [heartbeat] Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

By inversion of the holy sacrament of baptism. [waves lapping] You have to drown him. That's not what I mean. We know what happened in the name of love. 2000 years of war and suffering. No one can imagine what will happen in the name of evil. This child is not your son anymore. Remember that, Kristie.

[suffocates] -[suffocates] -[groans] [groaning continues] Help me. [indistinct] God, help me. [sobbing] [crying, sobbing] Help me! [screams] [shouts] I can't! I can't! [crying] I can't! -It has to be. -[shouts] No. [shouts] No! [continues crying] [necklace jingling] [sobbing] [gun cocks] [panting] [gunfire] [beeping] [Mullin] You're saying they wanted you to do it. They waited until you'd finished? Yes. But if they believed your son was the Antichrist, their idol... ...why would they want him dead? I don't know. Confess and God will forgive you. If I was right, there's nothing to confess. [light somber music] Father? Yes? Why can't you believe me? You're asking for too much. Then hell is where I belong. [door opens] [switch clicks] [door closes] [somber music] [door creaking, closes] [reporter] You can count them in their hundreds. The mourners gathering behind me to pay their last respects to a young boy who touched all who knew him, not just immediate family, not just friends and relatives, but people from all over the world whose lives were touched, however briefly, by his warmth, his beauty, and whose hearts were chilled by the tragic circumstances surrounding his death at the hands of his own mother. Just hours after the fatal accident of Jack Plummer, owner of this station that was laid to rest yesterday. Kristie St. Clair lies in a hospital bed not far from where I'm standing. A number of death threats have already been received. It's likely to increase as news of the atrocity -reaches the mainland-- -[priest] On this blessed day of the Lord, we have much to be thankful. The light which the young Dylan St. Clair... ...brought to the lives of the ones who knew him... ...and of those who only knew of him. The assurance of never ending life... ...of the resurrection from the Savior who rolled the stone from the cave, so that we can be thankful of the blessed assurance that this Easter Sunday brings us. A moment of silence, if you will. [flapping wings] [dramatic music] [Carmac] The contract... ...the rules of the game... A woman will bear a child... ...fostered by those who took the heart of their firstborn. Leading them, we hear the calling. And there will be plenty. [thunder rolling] [wind whistling] [people chattering] [leaves rustling] [reporter] I understand we're being uplinked to CNN and BBC world so we can be received all over the world now. This is Shelly Woodcock, I'm reporting from the Isle of Man where we're witnessing incredible things. A-- a storm out of nowhere. The very Earth is shaking. Children clutching to their mothers. People hanging off-- [people shouting] [intense music] [leaves rustling] [music continues] [lightning strikes] [thunder rolling] [gasps] [shouting] [Carmac] And you know it, Kristie. You know who his father is. [whimpers] [knocking] [knocking continues] Dylan. [knocking getting louder] [reporter] No one here can quite believe their eyes. Everyone is holding their breath, watching the incredible happen, staring dumbfounded at the miracle unfolding right in front of us, in front of the eyes of the world. Oh my God, the boy, Dylan St. Clair who was pronounced dead, excuse me, three days ago... ...and was lying in this coffin is now alive. He's very much alive. [Dylan] Mommy. I want you to be with me, Mom. I'm not mad at you anymore. I need you, Mom. Please. I love you, Mommy. Oh, go to hell. [ominous music] [gun cocks] [reporter] From Beijing to Los Angeles, more than 500 million people are with us now, and this is going out all over the world. So let me just repeat. The only way to describe what we're seeing here today, 120 miles off mainland Britain at the dawn of the third millennium, on Easter Sunday... ...is miraculous. I'm going to say what everybody here is thinking. We've seen a resurrection. [on radio] The Church of England is claiming spiritual property of the event. Vatican officials have not given a statement yet, but it is expected to follow within the next hour when the pope will speak to those tens of thousands already gathering on St. Peter's Square. [dramatic music] [radio host] The Archbishop of Canterbury has already stated that he will personally remain in close contact with... It's a new time, Greg Mullin. [radio host] Meanwhile, Christians all over the world speak openly of a resurrection.
