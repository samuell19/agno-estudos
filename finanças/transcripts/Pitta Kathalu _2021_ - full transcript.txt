My dear aunt! Phone. Ramula, I need your phone. I want to watch TikTok videos -You've seen enough. Go. Scram! -Hey, give it! Chinni, there's no charge in the phone. Please charge it while you watch. …Women's Council President, Mrs. Swaroopa. And also with us is he who says women's sovereignty is their mission and who has provided many opportunities in their party, District President, Mr. Bal Reddy. So, tell me, madam, as you were saying earlier, do you think women get their due respect in politics? I only see atrocities everywhere and no development. They did a huge campaign recently. They pleaded to me, "Swaroopa akka, we need your union’s support." No matter how bad the weather was, I stood at Subedari junction and gathered 50 people for the campaign and paid for it myself. Where do you think you got the votes from? So, do we award you with an MLA ticket for that now? What did you say? Didn't you hear what I said? What is she talking about? "Paid for it myself." -She’s talking nonsense. -Watch your tongue. -Don't teach me how to talk. -Lower your voice and your hand. That's not the problem here. I've had enough of your shit. I've seen enough. You guys either fall on my feet or pull me down. Now you talk about falling and pulling? You are in this position today because of our party. Because of your party? -Who do you think you are? -Who the fuck are you? -How dare you say that? -Who the hell are you? No, no, that's not what he meant. What are you saying? I'll show you who I am. What is this? Who does she think she is? What the hell is happening here? Hey! What is that? Who is this guy? Who is this? -Some random guy. -Why is "some random guy" in your video? Where is he in my video? He is in another video. They are different. Videos get attached, that's all. -Why are the videos attached? -It's called a duet, brother. -How do I explain this? -I know you won't. Give me his phone number. I'll talk to him. What is wrong with you? Everybody in the town does it. You will be getting married soon. Stop making these silly videos! -Why are you checking my phone? -These videos are on public domain. People are commenting on it. You're humiliating us. And you are yelling back at me? -Where are you going? -To Usha's place. For what? Will you make some more TikTok videos with her? Stupid girl. -Let's go. -Where? Are you mad? We are running late. Let's go. Where are we going? To the cinema. Which seats did you book? What? Which seats did you book? Show me. You and your silly doubts. Here. Seat numbers 28, 29. Let's go. We are late. Why did you book the corner seats? All seats were almost booked, that's why. I know the theater is empty. Don't lie to me. I mean… Hey! I won't sit close, let's go. Don't act stupid now. I don't trust you. Go watch soap operas on TV with your mom, stupid girl. What the hell is this? Who watches movies like this? -Hey, what are you doing? -Shut up and watch the film. Are you mad? Get up, get your ass up. What now? I’m hungry. Get some popcorn for me. What a dumb bitch. I shouldn't have come to a movie with you in the first place. You make TikTok videos, right? I'm talking to you. Who all do you make the videos with? Bro, it's getting late. Give me the popcorn. Who do you make the videos with? I make them with your mother. What's your problem? Don't snatch my popcorn. Give it back! Sister, not my mother. Ramula is my sister. Bro? You're ex-MLA Bandi Ravi's son, right? -Yes, brother. -Put on your helmet. -What? -Put on your helmet. If someone sees you and tells your parents, you'll be in trouble. What's going on? Bro, she is just a friend. Friend? You see that? He doesn't have the balls to tell the truth. And you dance around with him in theaters, making TikTok videos and shit! Tell him the truth, Ram Chander. -Bro, we are just friends. -Friends? What do you mean, "just friends"? You asshole. Tell him the truth, you bastard. We are not just friends. What do you mean by "just friends"? You dress well, but you don't have guts, you coward. Get on to the bike! You are making a scene! Hey, it’s hurting me! I will hit you with my… He thinks he's a hero. Bloody superstar! Look at him flaunting a gold chain. You and your… You think you are some big shit! What happened now? Went all limp? Let's go, get on to the bike. Hey! The whole town is watching. Get on the bike. "Just friends!" Hey! Inform your parents first, then come meet me. Is that clear? If I see you guys going to the movies or making TikTok videos… I’ll beat your ass to a pulp. Cool, bro. He is supposed to be your brother-in-law, not your bro, you jerk! You coward! Daddy. I need to talk to you. A man kills a person for his LIC premium money. This is what the world has come to now, killing people for premium money. It's called LIC. Do you know what LIC is? Every month you pay a certain amount, and if, due to some good fortune of mine, something happens to you, then they pay me money. Catch my drift? What did you understand? Yeah, so I pay some money… To which bastard will you pay the money and how much will you pay? -To them. -You do one thing. Take all my property and sign it off to some random fuck. To hell with it! How many times do I have to explain simple shit to you? I see you and I burn inside. And my BP shoots up the roof. What the fuck do I do with you? Shit! Hey, who is our prime minister? -Modi. -Who is the President of India? Kovind. Foreign affairs minister? Ask me. I'll tell you. -Who is it? -I don't care who it is? Your phone has all the information you need. With that information, I became an MLA. Information is not enough. You should also have some wisdom. Come here. Bend over. What is this? What the fuck is that? It's a new hairstyle. Style? I can't change you. You're a lost cause. Only marriage will set you straight. Look at this picture. How does she look? She is super white! You do one thing, move to Punjab and open a barber shop. Go, get lost, you dumbass. Fuck off! -What? -Come stand here. If my brother sees you, he'll create a problem. Why the fuck do you call me if you're so damn afraid of your brother? Don't talk to me about fear. You're a coward. I've seen that at the theater. You hit me. Later, if I'm nominated, who'll vote for me? -Who does she think she is? -Such a coward. Acts like a hero. -He thinks he's a hero. -She and my father have been troubling me. You have the balls to kiss me in the theater, but you can't talk to your folks about us? Stop saying I kissed you. I didn't kiss you! You wet your pants. Now you act all brave. Hey! Hey, are you mad? Why are scratching that wall? Breakup. I don't need any makeup. It's not makeup. It's breakup. B-R-A-K-K-A-P-P, breakup! We are done. I'm finished with you. -Is that it? -Isn't that obvious? Ramu, is that it? You don't have the guts to come and speak to my family, but you'll book corner seats in the theater! You said you’ll leave, go! -Do you have any shame? -Hey, look at your sister! Are we done, Ramu? Today is an auspicious day. I need to tell you something. What I mean is… people are being scammed, atrocities are happening everywhere. People are being looted daily. In our houses, in our colonies, and in our offices, our women are being harassed. Everywhere. Women are being taken advantage of. Let’s talk about employment. Who do you think has jobs? It’s women who don’t have jobs. Isn't this injustice? Isn't this an atrocity? I raise a question to you all. Shut up! People are bored and have been walking out for the past 30 minutes. If there's no one when the MLA comes, you'll be the one facing atrocities. There is a lot for me to talk, but allow me to introduce our beloved politician, helper of the poor, and who's one of us. Can you guess who it is? I think you all know who it is. Your faces are glowing. I feel you guessed it right. It is none other than our MLA Kadhar. I cordially invite him on to the stage. Now… I’m also going to invite another person on to the stage. Any guesses? A savior of all women, this person sheds a tear for every woman's problems. And that person is… He is none other than… the party chairperson, Prakash. I welcome him on stage. Please give him the bouquet. Your applause shouldn’t stop. Keep it going. Let's welcome him on stage. These two leaders have come to our colony like the electricity that lights our lives! It is because of them that we are now living a happy life. Bribe me with some food and cheap liquor like you bribed this crowd. I’ll also stand at the back and chant slogans. -Give me ten seconds. -Where do you idiots come from? -I’ll get you on stage in ten seconds. -Go! Our colony has developed so well-- You’re making my life difficult, you stupid fuck! Call sister on stage. All right. So I invite our party’s women empowerment cell president Sister Swaroopa on to the stage. Sister, thanks for coming. Women in the crowd were excited to see you. Sorry, we messed up a little-- Hey, it’s okay, Balraj. I understand. Do you think I worry about such things? You’re doing a good thing here. I’ll always support you. -Long live… -Okay, sister. -Sister. -Kiran, come here. Sister? Where did you get the garlands for the MLA? Sister? Where did you buy the garlands? -At Karim’s shop, sister. The one beside-- -They look different, pink in color. Yeah, the shop beside Asoka Hotel. They are not roses, are they? I think they are called orange. I’m telling you they're pink, and you’re saying they're orange. Orchid… I think they are called orchids flowers. Is that so? Then why didn’t I get the same garland, you asshole? Do you think I’m cheap? In a month’s time, I’ll make sure that the same Balraj felicitates me with the same orchid garland, or I’ll change my name. Start the vehicle. People are coming to his house to talk about his marriage, sister. As per tradition, the bridegroom's parents have to come to the bride's house, but we are all one. He is our only son. -Hey. -Take it. She asked me to resign from politics. I’m happily looking after my farm now. Take a look at the girl. I think I'm just blabbering. Why don’t you say something? I think the girl and the boy should also talk to each other. Ram Chander. Ram Chander! Go upstairs if you want to talk to her. Go! Get up! What kind of movies do you like? All movies. Every movie? How can you like every movie? -Even the ones that have flopped? -I watch every movie, and I like them all. Why do you like me? -You’re so darn white! -What? Yeah, you’re so damn white! No one’s ever told you? I’ve never seen anyone this fair, so damn white. -Is that why you agreed for this marriage? -Obviously. Do you wear makeup or is it natural? No, I don’t. I’ve been like this since childhood. How are you so fair without makeup? -Promise. -For real? I use only soap. Oh, my God! -Which soap do you use? -Rexona. Rexona… Which soap do you use? I’m coming! "Coming"? Coming where? I’ll be right back. Women get a bad name because of girls like you. How can you be so weak? What makes you think he won’t cheat with another girl in future? If that ever happens, then only you are to blame. Today, you were found on a bridge. Tomorrow, we might find many dead bodies under the bridge. Why? Because you chose to do nothing about this. You’ve decided to die anyway. I’ve given you a new life today. What you do with it is very important. You’ll have to use your power now. Do as I say. I’ll teach him a lesson. I have repeatedly told him. I'm not going to spare him today. If he doesn't listen to me today, I will kill him. Here he comes. Hey! Where did you go? Were you born to humiliate me? Hey, shut up, Dad. I like a girl called Ramula. We've been dating for two years. We love each other and want to get married. She is not from our caste, and she is poor, too. I’ll marry her if you're okay. If not, we'll elope. We'll elope. I'm not listening to anyone! Who’s calling me at this hour? Hello. Hello. Are you there? Tell me. What should I say? I’m feeling shy. All right, listen up. I love you. Why are you like this, Ram Chander? You stupid girl, I told my father I will not marry the girl of his choice. Are you even listening? I screamed at my dad. I told him that if he agrees, I’ll marry you. If not, I’ll elope with you. Is it true? You should’ve seen my dad’s face. Is it true? I think you got me close and something changed inside! I don’t want anyone. I want you. I only want you, and I’ll get married to you. Be ready. I’ll propose to you in front of your brother. -Are you sure? -Yes. Hey, Kishan, I like your sister! Hey, Kishan, I like your sister. I’ll elope with her if you don’t agree with our marriage. Kishan will go nuts. Sister, this is Ramula speaking. Tell me, Ramula. I don’t know what you did, but he has changed completely. He proposed to me. He said he will come talk to my family. I haven’t done anything yet. I’m about to set things right now. I’m going to break the bones of the monsters who clip our wings. -Be strong. -Sister? -We are going live. -I’ll talk to you later. Greetings! I’m here to show you the atrocities of a retired MLA's son. Sleeping with women and leaving them on the streets is like a daily ritual for them. I’ve captured his wrongdoings with the help of a hidden camera. His true colors are out now. Stop! I’ll say one, two, three, and then you start playing the song, okay? One, two, three. Start. Ramula, I love you! Ramula!
