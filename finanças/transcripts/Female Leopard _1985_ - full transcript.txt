Some bad news, I'm afraid. The family you're looking for has moved to the outskirts. Then... can you take me there? Yes. It's Yuko. The daughter... I was very surprised that we moved out here. Do I still have my room? When your brother built this place, he designed everything to match the old house. Is my brother's wife a nice lady? There's a party today Well, let's go. Sir, I've had too much to drink. You haven't finished yet... you are the reason for this party Ladies and gentlemen - sorry to interrupt... but we want to move on to the show for this evening. In Europe, Africa, South America, and of course in Japan... a butterfly is believed to be a carrier of the human soul. The soul transforms into the shape of a butterfly... When you see butterflies dancing in the spring sunlight... they look like an illusion, a spiritual daydream. Therefore, we have designed our show to describe that world: the Butterfly Lesbian Show. And now for tonight's main event... allow me to present the latest collection of Takuya Iruka. Another butterfly has emerged from its cocoon... Help me... please! Help me! Excuse me, sir... your sister has arrived from the States. Yuko? Sir - you lied to me. You are the devil! She's just an ordinary butterfly... boring. You can have her. Who is it? Welcome back, Yuko. Are you my sister-in-law? I'm Takako - nice to meet you. Give me a second. I'll be right out. I'm sorry to tell you this... but your brother cannot leave the party You must be tired from the flight... After graduation, I became homesick. Yuko... Yuko - you're back. Brother? Show me your face. What happened to your cheek? A little accident. You didn't touch the meal? Then be a good girl and go to sleep. I can't sleep! You are such a bad little girl. Please - let me go. I won't tell anybody anything. How can I believe that? Devil! Beast! What a filthy mouth you have. This is your fault... for flaunting your naked body Will you let me go? Because you aren't good... I must do this. What a stupid girl. Who are you? What's wrong? You can't do anything by yourself. I always have to do the dirty work. After doing something bad, your body becomes hot. The blood of the Iruka has merged inside me. Since my mother passed away... you're the only woman in the world who can take care of me. - Yuko came back. - Shut up! When I think about Yuko... I go crazy You're up early Where have you been? I went to Okunosawa for sketching. Why didn't you invite me along? I'd like to see Okunosawa too. That's out childhood town. There's nothing left. The village will be under the dam soon. Brother... do you have any special requests for a gift? I heard the news about your award. Congratulations. Thank you. Anything will be fine. You didn't tell me anything about your project... the award, winning, or even moving. Or Takako. I sent you an invitation to the wedding. You certainly did... but short notice, like you didn't really want me to come. I've tried not to think about this, but... there's something very wrong with you. Tell me what kind of person Takako is? While I was gone for six years, everything has changed at home. Husband - breakfast is ready Takako was the nurse who took care of mother at the hospital. Mother was very fond of Takako. I will take time to tell you more someday You have very good taste, ma'am. This one is made from the best fabric, with excellent seams. Plus, it's a very good price. I can't believe it. We designed it for a beautiful lady... like yourself. Would you like to try it on? Eh? This way please. In there. The designer of the dress would really love a beauty like you. He might even say 'no charge' for it. That seems suspicious. I can't tell you his name... but he's a very distinguished gentleman. His hobby is making gorgeous dresses, giving them to pretty girls... and inviting them to his house for a private party He has a very good reputation in society This isn't a dangerous offer. Come to New City Hotel in Akasaka at 7 o'clock tonight. Don't worry... as this is your first time, I'll go with you. A perfect fit. It's Yuko - is my brother home? Is that so? Never mind. Yes, goodbye. Madam - you have stress. I can tell; a very stiff neck. Was that the daughter? I wonder what she's doing outside... I heard she was looking for a present... for the master. There's something fishy Pay close attention to her. Yes. Hello, it's Mlle... from Allice. Mistress - I've found the perfect girl, as per your request. I see. Takuya will be on his way to the hotel... - The perfect size for you. You look great. - Thanks. - He seems to be late... why don't we order drinks? - Okay - To your health. - Cheers. Sir - she's all yours. You should say goodbye to your ordinary wardrobe. You look good in elegant clothes. Is that true, sir? Your body is feminine and perky You'd look best in silky fabric. This is like a dream! Fashion tips from the famous Mr. Iruka! I'm looking forward to showing you off at tomorrow's party Undress and let me see your proud contours. Akiko - your dress is ready After the fitting session, why don't you go with him to the club for drinks? Yes. I don't know what happened to her afterwards. Many girls who visit Harajuku have disappeared. We can't trace their whereabouts after they visit your boutique. Your expensive boutique, Alice. This should be fun... either the police will find out, or my magazine article will expose your secret. - Would you excuse me? - Hey! When this is published, Alice's reputation will be ruined. Off the record, somebody asked me to help him. Or rather, somebody's wife asked me to help. - Who was it? - Sorry I can't tell you. But it's somebody very famous... that's all I can tell you. And the drink you gave her... contained only sleeping pills? If there are any side effects, I will help her against you. Everything is fine. Excuse me. I'm on your trail... don't do anything stupid. Are you okay? Thank you very much for helping me. This is the weirdest reunion. - When did you return? - Yesterday I was shocked when I heard that you were going to the States. Did you marry? No - I'm still a poor bachelor journalist. Are you still in the same apartment? Yes. I still live with the memories. I'm sorry What's wrong? What are you thinking about? I'm sorry - the same as on that night six years ago. Don't worry about it. He)" Last night... was your brother in the bar? - Let me walk you out. - Thank you... but I'd rather be alone. I have things to think about. May I visit the house? I'm curious about the Iruka family Be ready for the surprise; I've prepared a nice toy for tonight. The girls you collect for me have no class. Can't you get somebody tastier? Come in. The reporter from 'Maicho' wants to do an interview with Mr. Iruka. He's busy preparing for the award party Ask the reporter to come back some other time. - But I don't... - Excuse me. I have something to ask about... besides his paintings. It won't take long. Takuya Iruka is a world-famous artist... he doesn't have to answer private questions. Does this girl look familiar to you? So many girls want to be his models... I can't remember every girl who shows up here. Takuya - excuse me... - Tetsu! Tetsu! - Yes? This third class magazine reporter wants to ruin our party Ger rid of him! Takuya - I love you. No one will take you from me. Congratulations for the award from the Italian Gallery As you know, Master Iruka has been painting pieces... using butterflies as a motif. Now he is prepared to fly away like a butterfly to the world stage. Ladies and Gentlemen... come onto the floor for the dance party Everyone - join us and enjoy yourselves. Brother - will you dance with me? How do I look in this dress? Where is the girl who was locked in the cage? I don't want to talk about it right now. Where did you stay last night? Brother and sister- what a nice relationship. Husband - I want to introduce someone to you... as my gift for your award. Daughter Yuko - you should not follow him. Some things it's better not knowing about. What are you doing? No - this butterfly doesn't have elegance... Somethings wrong. Wrong. She's not! This is Takuya Iruka's studio... no-one is allowed to enter here... not even his sister. Yes? What's happened? I thought that you were at your brother's party? Hold... hold me! What's wrong? Brother... Please do not investigate the Iruka family any more - Yuko You came back. You're not wanted here. Leave your brother alone. Can you explain what happened to those innocent girls? It's none of your business. You wouldn't understand anyway I'm doing what your mother wanted. She was concerned about incest destroying this family Tetsu! Tetsu! Yes? As per my husband's orders, you may destroy her. Get your hands off me. Get off! Don't touch me! Takuya Iruka - where are you? Iruka - where? Yuko? Where are you? Yuko? Where are you? Kenzo Iruka Takafumi Iruka Noriharu Iruka Suekichi Iruka Takako - please stop! Yuko doesn't want to see you. I heard an interesting story from Mr. Mita at Alice. - Anyway I guess I'll call the police. - Hey - Tetsu, don't let him go. - Yes! This way Chie - did somebody come in? There's nobody here. You'll get into trouble with the mistress. Go straight to Okunosawa... meet Goro at Shimotsuji. He will tell you all the secrets about the Iruka family Go now! I don't know about this... I don't know! - That way - Thank you. Go straight to Goro. Brother... I'm sorry I was very wrong. No. Don't worry about me. Go away! Leave this house immediately! How do I get to Okunosawa? Okunosawa? Just behind that wall over there. Ah... how much of the village will be under the dam? Everything, including the houses and forest, will be under the water. Thanks. Hey! Wait! All I did was to sell pesticide to the mistress. What kind of pesticide? It's just something we use to kill rodents. - It must be very strong. - I don't know... Where did you bury the dead girls? Yuko - Goro confessed to everything. Takako organized the dam project, making sure Goro got paid extra. In exchange, he helped her to bury the bodies. He also told me the story about you and your brother. Takuya was obsessed with butterflies... he would cry all the way home if he didn't catch some. Goro remembered how Yuko would stare and watch the whole thing. Goro was making a time money by selling butterflies. Your mother loved your brother so much. She brought him up strictly But she always kept Yuko at a distance. Ironically, Takuya became an adult with an Oedipal complex. Brother... Yuko... Brother...
