So... hello, good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen. Normally, I think that... I'm not allowed to film here. It's roughly 4 in the morning... 4:10, 4:10 in the morning. I can't sleep. That's because I've already slept plenty earlier on, in other words 6-7 hours. I don't need more sleep, even if I'm given Depakine to make me sleep, some Rivotril and 6 mg of Risperdal a day. So, hum... So, I'm ok... I'm cool. But I can't wait to get out and get started editing the film. So, hum... there. I hope you enjoy watching the film. I hope that if this moment in the film which I'm filming right now... whether it takes place in the beginning, in the middle or at the end, that it's not too boring, that it's been edit properly and that you won't be too bored... and that perhaps you will even applaud. Because when a film you make gets some applause... Hum yeah, got to get that right. When people applaud a film you make, it's pretty nice, really. There. Enjoy the rest of the film, because, this won't be the end, for sure. Ciao, ciao! "Madmen are the unfortunate explorers of the invisible." It's a quote, but I don't know who from. I looked it up on the Internet, but didn't manage to find out. So I'm going to take it for myself and say it's mine. To explain it a little, it's true we're kind of like explorers. In other words... we're on the frontline and don't really have the choice. And since everything goes on inside our heads, it's indeed invisible. Yet it's very real... in the sense that I really went through some stuff like... life and death experiences or... thinking I am God, or Jesus or... but literally, you know. At the time, I was the centre of my world and therefore the centre of the world. Now that I'm back in the real world, I hold on to others or to their image. Just like with this fountain, I hold onto it. In fact, I find it... like us, you, me, the "Loulous" we are... at different levels, I find this fountain... bizarrely beautiful. - How're you doing Caroline? - I'm ok and you? - Good? - Good. - So, are you happy to be at the Univers Cafe? - Hum? - Are you happy to be at the Univers Cafe? - Yes. - Having a little Coca Cola... - Yeah, it's nice. - Where is that Coke? Ah, there it is. - It's there. Elodie? Yes? Oh! Every time I think I've found my music and it's not the right one. Aren't you a bit close there? No, it's not too close. We're under a storm, having a drink. Yeah. I've got loads of water running down my back. Oh yeah, I can see that. I'm ok, I'm dry. Ask me some questions. - What's your job? - I've never had a job in my life. - I was at le Repuis for 2 years. - At le Repuis? - Yes. - It's in Yverdon, right? Yes. I was doing carpentry. - Do you enjoy carpentry? - No. - What do you like doing? - I'm in Alphaset now, doing laundry. - And do you like doing laundry? - Yes. - Really? - Yes, I like it. What do you dream about doing? - Travelling. - Just travelling? You've travelled a bit, right? Yes, I've been to Canada, Mexico, China... Hungary... Greece... Tunisia... that's it. Oh, but that's pretty good! I've been to Brazil... India... - So lucky! - Morocco... France, Germany, Spain, Italy, England. I think that's it. Yes. - You're not at Préfargier at all? - What? - You're not at Préfargier? - Not anymore, I got out on Monday. - So you're a the Rocher home? - I'm at my mum's. - Ok yeah. - I'm tired. - Yes, I can see, your eyes are spinning. - Oh shit, man. Is that your meds or didn't you sleep well? Didn't sleep... - Yes, it shows. - It shows right? Me I'm ok. For me it was last weekend. Yeah. - That's it. - Ok. - Thanks! - You're welcome. Anyway, I had a good meal, we had pasta with salmon. Just to let you know... it was really good. You seem a tiny bit stressed when we film you. - Are you feeling stressed? - No. No. OK. So, where did that Florida side go? - The one I had during my decompensation? - Before, yes. It's well hidden away. How do you explain that? I don't explain it, it's... it's as if I had lost my imagination. Oh, 7h04! We've been here for 4 minutes. 6 minutes since it's running. You tell me when you want me to stop. Normally I wear contact lenses. I prefer my face without glasses. - What about the beard? - The beard, I don't really like it... Yes, without the beard too. I should have my hair cut. - You've been telling me this for at least 2 weeks. - Yeah. Why don't you get on with it? Because I think I like having my hair long. So why do you want to have your hair cut? Because long hair is annoying. - But you also like it. - That's right. And it's cold, it keeps your head warm. - You could wear a hat. - You can wear a hat, yes. Well, Ladies and Gentlemen, I think that's it for now. Perhaps it's even the end of my film, I don't know. It would be nice to finish on this. - Why on this? - On this. On this. Why not? If all the films, except the ones in the booth,... but if all the films that were made... since the beginning of my life... when I started smoking cigarettes, in all the films, I have one of these in my hand. And, generally, when my brother is filming me, he even films the cigarette trademark that I film... hum... that I smoke. You're filming me, I'm making mistakes. I'm getting wrong. - I know you're filming me. - Yeah I know, that's the point. I'm a bit perturbed because I know you're filming. So, as I was saying, my brother made a lot of films about me. I even acted in a film called Virtual Contact. It's about a guy who's hooked on the Internet, then he loses his best friend because of that. In the end he realises he's stupid. So he decides to give up the Internet for a while and to contact his friend again... and he goes to the guy's house, then... they both sit at the computer and then, hum... that's it. They discover they share the same passion. I'm really used to anything to do with Super8, cameras, video cameras, etc. I have no... problem in front of a camera, you see? I'm completely relaxed. It's just that I suddenly realised you were filming me and I got a word wrong. You're allowed to get a word wrong... Normally I never get it wrong because I'm used to improvising... I always improvise, I never prepare my lines in advance. That's why it sounds so natural. All my gestures, my glances... I can look away, I can look at the lens, I'm able to look into the camera... so that whoever is watching thinks I'm looking into his eyes. That's how... That's how it is, it's intuitive. My mother's been filming me since I was little, I know how to be filmed. Now I'd like you to stop filming me, please. There... it's my new musical instrument. So... Actually... I play a little music. I used to be in a band. Well, I'm still in it but we're having a break right now. I'm starting to practice by myself. I've already played live at the La Main squat. I only knew one piece so it was pretty rubbish. Now I try to write them down. I have three: Fuck, Idiot, Caca. I know it sounds crazy... I have lyrics I wrote down. Pretty crazy, right? I don't know how... I intro'ed this badly... Take your time, it's rolling, you've got all the time you need. It will be edited anyway... I'm going to sit down. I don't know! What do you want? Play me a tune you know. Anything. You want me to sing and everything? I'm embarrassed... There you go, that was freestyle. Using the word 'house' was new. I'll write it down. Where can I write it down? Are you ok? Yeah, right there, you look like... an angel... - All white... - Just your glasses are black. - Look. - Doesn't matter. I'm a bit stressed out. Are you scared of looking into the camera? No, no, I enjoyed it. - You like it? - Yeah. Talk to our audience, what do you want to tell them? Well... ok then, I'm bipolar... I'm bipolar since I was 18 years old and to tell you the truth, I met you in the hospital. And for me... I don't know what to say... I'd like to say that this disease is not a great advantage. It can have its benefits sometimes, when you're on a high, you have many ideas, but the problem is I never manage to finish my ideas. I just can't finish them. I think you'll manage. You're going to make it Emmanuel. - Well I'm starting. - Yeah, you are. As this summer, normally I should be at the bottom of the pit... - At the end of my tether. - But you won't be. Exactly. And that's what I think is great in a way. This hospitalisation I went through during the winter... enabled me... to focus on myself, which I had forgotten to do over time. Because I was hospitalised at 18, twice. At 18 and 19 years old, for severe decompensations. I thought I was someone else, I thought I was a sound-effects guy for Radio Couleur 3, anyway... I thought I had miniature microphones. Which happens to a lot of people who... I'm not going to name them but... I thought I had microphones in my shirt. Like: a shirt button would be a mic that had been implanted into me. Not implanted, but that I had been fitted with and I was being recorded. And I was convinced of this. I'd walk around Geneva, I'd talk to myself and sometimes I made sound-effects. It's a complicated disease, because... I was really unwell, really not well at all, just in that room next door, there, where I've been living for 22 years, coming and going. I shared a flat, didn't go well. Shared again, didn't go well again... Went to live in a squat, didn't go well, but it was about me: I was too unwell. - You had ups and downs. - I had pretty severe ups and downs. Now I tell myself... that it's summer time and things are beautiful. Yesterday I nearly cried because... well I cried a little, out of happiness, not sadness. Because I told myself: shit man, why didn't I get some help earlier on. I don't want to say that I was badly being looked after, but I was... how shall I put it... I didn't tell my shrink the truth. - Oh yeah, me too! - I was hiding my suffering. And when you hide your suffering... things don't improve. You don't get to know yourself better. Now things are ok, I can express myself, I don't feel awkward. Right now I feel I feel a little awkward because... there's an eye, a Cyclops' eye looking at me. It feel weird, it's been a while since I've been filmed. I don't know... Anyway, all these images, you know... You have control over them too. You need to understand it. Yes, but you're there, hiding behind it. - I'm well hidden, right? - Yeah, you're hiding alright! Pretty good hiding place. - Hiding's good? - As images go, it's not bad, It could be the cover of your DVD. Alright. Wait, just there, with your face hidden... I could take a picture of you. - I don't know, it's an idea... - Yeah, it's a good idea! We can't see your face, just your chin and your forehead. So I'm a Cyclops. That's it, you've turned into a Cyclops. I'm going to tell you a story that's close to my heart. It was at the admissions unit, the crisis unit actually, a place where birthdays don't tend to be celebrated... and where we're not allowed to carry a lighter . We had to ask the nurses when we wanted to smoke a cigarette. One of my mates, a patient, I don't really remember his name, but he's probably still over there, well it was his birthday... in the crisis unit. With 2-3 other patients, we managed to each have a lighter, so we had 4, I think. So we flicked our flames and we sang Happy Birthday... and he blew them out. It was a beautiful moment and after that we took our medication. That makes me think that... I'm lucky to only have one med to take now. It's a neuroleptic, Abilify. I take around 300 mg a month, which is a mid to low dose, and it helps me be to stable. It's there to filter the dopamine that secretes... It's the brain's energy, in short. In a way, I'm anesthetised without really knowing it. I would love to be able to live without it at some point. Without this... pharmaceutical chemical energy in my brain. I know it's risky, when I'll be stronger, more stable, more grounded, I'd love to stop. I think it's understandable, even if I'm told not to do it, because it's risky. It's risking having an episode... when I might feel more things in the end. To feel... normal. So, Nathan Hofstetter... where do you begin? If you begin by saying that it's hard to... tell the difference between what is a traumatic episode, what comes before and what comes after the disease. What's linked with the disease what is linked to your personality traits. What relates to the trauma, to your mother's death. I would say that from that point on, there are so many different mechanisms... there are so many things that get in the way. As soon as you can access that, and you confront all that, there'll be rejection, there is a rejection of all that, a very violent one. You will very quickly try to get out of the situation. Firstly, through anger... and if that doesn't work, by... accepting... or rather accepting in the eyes... of the one who is accusing you of that whatever it is,... to be able to move on as quick as poss after that and that means that... where your memory is concerned, you rarely remember these kinds of events. And moreover... you don't have free access... to all this information, that some people would refer to as your subconscious mind. Everyone has a different name for that place we can't really access. And being analytical, very analytical, I find it strange because I'm someone who turns things over and over in my mind... who cuts everything in the past, the present and the future, with several interpretations. I don't think I get it very wrong... I don't for other people, but I'm often wrong when i'ts about me. That's where I lose my strength. - You're wrong about yourself? - Of course. - But me too. - You too. Yes, we have that in common. What else do we have in common? What's important for me, is to have access to the information. But also to be able to adapt the vision we have of ourselves... The difference between what others see and what we see. Do you get it? Yes. I'm trying to find out what we could call a form of objectivity. - Ah! - Which is in fact subjective. This so-called objectivity is... if you look at all your relatives, all the people who have ever known you, all the ways you have of perceiving yourself... Like a prism. The intersection of all of that, everything that brings you closer to objectivity. - Ok. - You get what I'm saying? - The diamond. - Yeah... in a way. It depends on where you look. But yes, inside the diamond, where all the lights crisscross. And then, if you can think of the fact that the more you dig... well, there you have it. You asked me the question: 'what do we have in common?' I think we express it very differently, but we both love... human beings, despite everything. And even if I have defence mechanisms which make me super fatalistic... which means I easily put down the human species, in the end, we both give it that much importance. For you it will be in those small moments, rather than in quality. In fleeting moments, in exchanges with other people. For me it will be more about digging, digging, digging... about the people around me. That's why I'm really scared of people around me. That's why you're not at all scared of the human dimension. It's also because you are a Loulou. It has been a while since... I've filmed myself during an episode of paranoia. A really good, strong one. Up till now I've always managed to have them at home. Which is rather nice. Right now, what I'm obsessed with the most... What's getting to me the most... but why... there... Choosing the right frame, having a sharp image, it's not easy in the end. I'm completely, as I speak, paranoid. Yup... right now, I'm frozen. I'm finally feeling the weight of all those gazes. I'm even taking a risk filming. Not too much though... What am I doing right here? I'd like to know What am I doing here? Right here, right now But what am I doing down here? What am I doing right now? Anyway, I tell myself I can Think of the void I tell myself I can Think of nothing Do I look futile, labile-like Knowing that the rhymes Come directly when you're on a mode that's automatic You sing out loud what was going through your mind Never sing, a love that's Mul... ti... form. You carry on, still focused On your sharpness You're still focused On our sharpness You're still focused On your sharpness You're still focused On your sharp... ness Can you see, Ladies and Gentlemen, the audience I was really stuck on the outside. I told myself, I'm tired, I haven't slept in 36 hours... I'm really tired, what should I do? Let's go to my mum's in Bienne. 20 minutes before catching the first train to Bienne, I was in front of the Pourtalès Hospital. I'd heard about the CUP, the Psychiatric Emergency Centre... and I thought, I'm going to go to the CUP actually, so I can sleep. They'll all be nice, they'll make me a bed let me sleep. Great. I got there, sat down, started to take my socks off, my shoes, I sat in a yoga position like that. I had a shirt and I pulled it over my face, I sort of fell asleep, I played with kids' toys then... First of all a nurse saw me and said: "Blow in the breathalyser." I thought I'm going to be over the limit but in fact I only had 0.11 So then I told the nurse: that means I can drive! I'm not drunk. She replied: That's right, you're not drunk. But there was already something wrong. Then a second male nurse came along, a good looking black guy, super classy, he was wearing a silver signet ring. And... he took my blood pressure. I told him my blood pressure was perfect. He replied: yes, your blood pressure is good. I knew it, I'm doing fine. But I was on a bad trip, and didn't realise it. Finally, a doctor saw me. Actually, it was a psychiatrist, but I didn't know it. He asked me to wait for 10 minutes, so I waited, they moved me to another room and when I arrived in the other room, there were 7 armed cops waiting for me. That's when I understood something was wrong. I'll bet! I got right up close to the cops, right in their faces, 3 centimetres from them... and I said: Hi. You ok? What do you want? What's your problem? What's up guys? Are you ok? I was walking around. I wasn't being physically violent but I was treading the line. Suddenly one cop said: "yeah, I doubt it." I looked at him and said: What do you mean, you doubt it? D'you know me? What do you know about whether I'm going to go to that meeting or not? He didn't reply. And I still didn't get it! Then I went into the ambulance, still not getting it. I was in the ambulance with a male nurse and I was chatting calmly. Then I arrived in the isolation booth. That's when I got it: I was in psychiatric hospital. They told me: we're going to give you an injection, you are going to take some meds. And I said no, that I wouldn't take anything. That's not right, I'm not taking anything. They told me: lie down, it'll be fine. So I lay down, I remember... and then... I looked at one of the male nurses, I saw a syringe somewhere, and I was sure they wanted to jab me. I got up and, just like that, I got in the nurse's face, 2mm from him, I got up in front of him, but super quick. So they got really scared and they grabbed my arm, here. Got my arm... and then, I let myself fall to the ground. I fell asleep right there. What happened that night, I only found it out... 3 months later, with the watchman I met later on, on a night out and who told me: Actually, Nathan, when you woke up you picked a fight with me. I've never fought anyone in my life, I only got hit once, when I was in primary school... by a guy I'm not in touch with anymore. I only got hit once in my entire life. One single time and I don't even remember it. Which I think is proof enough, that the label I've been given, the way I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia, unfortunately or fortunately, I must admit it could be a disadvantage or an advantage, it's true. The last time I saw my mother, I'm the last person to have seen her... alive, actually... it was a beautiful moment, because she was... a bit sick. No one knew what she had yet, we found out later. I remember it was really beautiful, I had put my brother on the phone... as he was with his new girlfriend, who's still his girlfriend now. So my brother spoke to her on the phone. I remember it was a beautiful day, and she was in her tiny studio flat. I don't know... there was love, there was... There was a beautiful moment between a son and his mother. A few days later, she didn't pick up the phone anymore. I didn't get it. Nobody seemed worried about it except for me. So I went to her place, it had been two days since she didn't pick up the phone. It was strange. When I got to the front door, there were four policemen who were chatting in front of it. I put the two together straight away. The more experienced, older one of them, simply talked to me in a professional way: Mister Hofstetter, your mother has passed away. I felt something I had never felt before, my breathing came from my stomach, like a sort of crying... in the stomach, as if I couldn't breathe anymore. Then, I became... I was in denial... I only got involved in the ceremony organisation... and everything we were going to do to pay tribute to her. My mother was someone who shone like the sun... and she died of Acute Plasmodium. She died of malaria after returning from a trip to Cameroon to see her boyfriend. She had forgotten to take one antimalarial tablet, and there was only a 5% chance to catch the virus in that place. So, hum... She was really unlucky. Because you fall into a coma in that kind of situation. That's it. You look beautiful. - It's just... - Yeah, yeah... - You don't believe me? - Yes, I believe you, since you say so. I believe you. It's just that... There's an issue with the sharpness. It doesn't need to be too sharp, it's better if it's blurred. It hides wrinkles and imperfections... Oh, it's ok now. You see you're not scared of the camera! - Sure, because you're asking me questions. - Yes, that's it. We're just doing a test, they're just tests. You are very pretty, don't worry. - OK. - You know you're beautiful Mummy. Yeah... You try to convince yourself of it every day. That's the problem, you don't need to. You're a sweetie pie, you're lovely. I'll sing you... an excerpt from Carmen next time. You can film me when I'll sing it by heart. - Carmen in Spanish? - No! No, no, it's an excerpt from... from Bizet's opera. It's about love, actually. You'll have to film me when I sing that. - When I'll sing that piece. - Ok! - I'm going to stop filming soon. - Yes stop. - You want me to stop? - Yes. Thank you, that was sweet, you've cheered me up. Ok, I just need some silence before I stop filming. - The day I was born, what time was I born? - You were... I know what time it was. We had left from... - I think we were in Chaumont? - Yeah... You were born in... - At what time? - At 18h11 or 21. And you were at...? - Was it in Pourtalès? - Pourtalès Hospital, yes. - I don't remember. - You don't remember? I remember the moment but... not the details. You remember the dead guy in the taxi, but not Nathan... Yes but that was six or seven years earlier... - Your father, he's beginning to get old... - But you have an elephant's memory Dad! - You say I have an elephant's memory. - But you do have an elephant's memory! OK then, sing me a song. Sing me a song. - Sing me a song. - A song. One fine morning one comes into the world The world knows nothing of it Then we grow up We begin again The danse of life Then we use our hands Carrying on the path That our ancestors started on I know the day will come When this path will come to an end This day will come soon Perhaps What is all this about? What is all this about? For the little time We have left to live What is all this about? What is all this about? For the little time We have left to live. We get to know Each other and we still say I love you forever Eternity is not about centuries Not counted in centuries, but in days You may still tell me That nothing will have changed With notes and phrases I'll carry on singing Holding my fingers up in a 'V' While everything around me Burns down What is all this about? What is all this about? Don't ask me to follow you What is all this about? What is all this about? For the little time We have left To Live Grandad! Marcel! Harmonica? Go on. Will you play me a little tune on the harmonica please? For me? Say yes? Say yes? Ok, are you ready? So... Here we go... Go on, take the harmonica. Go on Grandad! Go on! You know how to play? You want me to play? I love you sista! I love you too.... Lots! Yes! Of course! Yes, I'm at home! For real! I've never felt as powerful in my entire life! Too scary, sorry. I'm sorry, it's crap! Fuck! It really does me good To see you right now To continue creating images Of you. Really, I love you Fodder for the animals. Fields and more fields. It was beautiful because the sky took on an extraordinary importance, it represented half of what you saw in front of you. There were no mountains, nothing at all. - It wasn't bad. - It was flat. I have a picture of a sunset under a tree... - I'd like to scan it. - No problem. Ok Dad, I'm gonna catch my train, are you staying? - I'm gonna buy you some cigarettes? - OK. Are you coming with me? And we have witnesses, hundreds of millions of witnesses watching us; I'm going to smoke a cigarette my son gave me. - See you later. - I love you, son. - I love you. - I love you too Father. Are you ready? If you manage first time around, this could launch your acting career. Whenever you're ready. - I can't... - Take your time, take your time. Wait. I'm concentrating. - I'm remembering where I was at. - You want the mirror effect? - Go on. - No, don't move! That's not the mirror effect. It's another effect. Go on. Shit. - It's worse, actually. - Make yourself beautiful for it then. Oh, there's red light in my eyes, it looks badass! That's good, it means the image is sharp. Ok, uhm... - I can see myself, so it's worse. - Go on, say it. It's ok. I'm beautiful. - Open your eyes. - Yes. - Are you gone? - No I'm here. I'm happy to be here. On Earth and... to capture people, their emotions, to make this my job... it's my job, in fact. To film people. - Film people... - Those close to me, people. Even those who are not close to me, it makes me so happy. Just like you are doing now, I tell myself: for once I... I'm on the other side of the lens, on this side. I understand that it puts me... in the position other people experience. It's a sort of tension where you think things are set in time, because it's like an archive, a memory, something you can show, something recorded. I think I know which word I'm going to finish the film on. - It can only be one word? - I will be only one word. There, and then... - Well... you'll see. - Go on, say it! - I'm not going to say it. - Why? And perhaps I've already said it... - Liant? - No. No. - Would you tell me if it was that? - Do you know what it is?. - You don't know what it is? - No. You've seen the last version of the film, you should know what it is. I got all of that last bit out of my head. - I didn't like the ending. - You see! - I love you. - I love you too. Is that it? Ah, no!
