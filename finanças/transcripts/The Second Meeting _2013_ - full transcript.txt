[jet engine noise] Many layers of clouds. I saw the missile launch... Roger, roger. Out of the aircraft, down. Vega-31, Vega-31, going down. 31 is going down. The first American F117 stealth bomber crashed during NATO air raids on Yugoslavia Oh dear god, keep him safe, just keep him safe... [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [violin music] Good morning. It's very early. It's a beautiful spring day in early May and here we are in the dining room. I've been asked to prepare some video diaries of the Zelkos. So come on, let me go show you why, one of the main reasons why it's so difficult for me to leave my home every morning to go off to work. [silence] Yellow shirt today. Shaved last night. Hello, hello bird. Hello, hello bird. Time to head out. Oh, boy, come on. I really must get a new flag up there. I knew that Dale would be deployed. Before they deployed, the wives had had... [music] they had a dinner or function for all the wives just to get together. And informed us that if something happened to our husbands they'd come to our homes and tell us in person. [phone ringing] So this was the fourth night of the war. We have planned two waves of F117s, I was on the first wave and there was also going to be some B2 stealth bombers coming through later on that night. They had cancelled all NATO air strikes, so all NATO strike packages were cancelled that night because of the weather. Extremely challenging weather night. So the only game in town, as they say, were the LO guys, the low observable guys. I have already done my mission study, target study, and prep for that, but so strong on my mind was, you know what, if there was ever a night, if there was ever a mission for an F117 to get shot down, this is the night and my mission's the one. [jet engine sound] [explosion] [explosion] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Saturday morning came. I woke up very disturbed. I did get my target. That night was very challenging because of the weather and many layers of clouds, off target headed west for about a minute 40 seconds or so and then the aircraft turned a very aggressive turn to the northwest. As soon as I rolled out of that turn, I started looking outside for the known threat systems. So just after I roll out, I'm looking, a quick look around, and a quick look at right 4 o'clock, and there they were. [beeps] I didn't see the missile launch because of the low bottom layers of clouds. But I saw two missiles punch out from that bottom layer of clouds and as soon as I saw those missiles, I thought they got me. [explosion] Good afternoon. Here we are, finished with the work and on our way home. Hurray! I see our post, mailbox. I'm getting home just as the others are. There's Keegan bouncing the tennis ball. They've just gotten home. Mollie... Hurray, hurray. Keegan's noticing that I'm filming. There's Torin in the woodshed. Let me see if I can keep this going and... manage to turn the car off and escape my prison. Hello, hello! Hello, Nutboy! Hello Molly-cholly-lollypop. Hello Torin, Shea Zelko. I'm a-going in the... Hello little fellow. Are you a leprechaun? Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey a kiddley divey too wouldn't you? Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey a kiddley divey too wouldn't you? What is this contraption? - Hello my beautiful bride. - Yeah, beautiful bride with this... - Let's have a kiss. I was in the absolute worst possible body position for an ejection. This is really, really, really bad. [beeps] The next memory I have is being in the ejection seat, out of the cockpit, and I see the cockpit and the aircraft falling away from me. I can see the lights in the cockpit, all the warning and caution, you know, red and yellow lights falling away. But then all these other thoughts, are on my mind as I'm still in the seat. One is, again in a very light, humorous sort of way, you know, my mom is not gonna be happy about this. So I thought about my mom, I thought about my daughter. And again, in this light, humorous sort of way, I imagined being on the ground kicking the dirt, and saying: "Nuts, isn't this inconvenient". I might not be able to call my daughter tomorrow on her birthday, and she was going to turn 10. How come I'm still in the seat? Had my hand on this handle on the ejection seat that you can pull that manually opens up the lap belt and you can try to wiggle yourself out of the seat and push the parachute out of the top of the seat. Now give it another few seconds -- one potato, two potato, three potato, four potato -- BAM! The seat pops me out, parachute deploys, inflates and I'm hanging under the canopy of the parachute. Look down, thought OK, I got my stuff. Oh, survival vest looks like I got all my stuff, still had my oxygen mask on, took that threw it away, visor was gone, that makes sense it got blown off, check canopy and my first reaction was "Yes, perfect canopy". No malfunctions at all, and then my second thought again in this light and humorous sort of way is "You have got to be kidding." An orange and white panel parachute. Glowing like a Chinese lantern. Here I am flying in a single ship, not talking, not squawking, there's good chance nobody knows this just happened. So, the rescue time is the most critical element. So I thought, you know what, I need to get on the radio, now. So I got out my survival radio about one minute after I was under canopy. I'm hanging in the canopy, coming down, probably 7 or 8 thousand feet above the ground and I got out my survival radio and I started making mayday calls. And I just said "Mayday, mayday, mayday, Vega-31's going down." Mayday, mayday, mayday, Vega-31 Mayday, mayday, mayday, Vega-31 Vega-31, Vega-31, going down. So I start to make these calls and I got no response. 31 is going down. So I wanted at least to get out that hey I was out of the aircraft and I'm alive. Vega-31 last position in aircraft was approximately a point after target. At that exact moment I was on the couch crying and praying, and just really crying out to God, please God, let him live, just please, bring him home, let him live. Of course, I had no way of knowing that something was wrong but I just felt this total sense of dread and I was so overcome, just screaming in my home to please, please, bring him home, that I loved him so much and I just want him to be OK. Roger, roger, out of the aircraft, down. Soon after this, the phone rang. I knew that it was not good information, I had one of those gut feels that people sometimes get and you just know that the phone is ringing for a bad reason. [phone ringing] Oh dear God, keep him safe, just keep him safe. At any rate, the general basically told me that we had lost a plane and that it was Dale's plane. The good news, as he said, was that we knew he was alive and that he had ejected safely from the plane. And of course, they didn't know where he was. There was some, they knew he had made the ejection and he had made this radio call but they had no idea of knowing at that point was he on the ground safely, was he already captured, very unclear of his status. Dear Lord, please let him live, just let him live. So it was hard to see that on the news. [explosions] [explosion] [silence] [ambient sound] [music] Here we are again, on the way home now. Some of the other things that I have with me, that I'm surrounded by in my car are a voice recording of my wonderful, beautiful, blessed grandfather Joseph Ryan Sweeny who, starting in 1970, started recording some of his thoughts and favorite music and recording readings from passages from some of his favorite literature with the intention that some day, posthumously, after he was long in heaven, that the grandchildren and great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren would have and enjoy. Let us listen. [music] [ambient sound] Hey, Lauren. - Yes. - What time is it? - It's little after 1 o'clock in the morning. - What are you doing? - I am quilting This is the time of night that I usually quilt. - Tell me what you're working on. - I'm working on a quilt for Zoltan and Mrs Dani and we decided to do a quilt for her. I don't know whose idea it was, mine or yours? Do you know? Yeah, Keegan Patrick Shea Zelko, my son, my beautiful beloved son would like to play something. He wanted me to introduce this, he said he was too shy, but... Keegan's gift to the Serbian people. And, what are you going to play? [violin music] I'm very close to traveling to Serbia for the second meeting, and I hope that Zoltan and I, and Zoltan's family and my family become very good friends. I hope so. Maybe we won't like each other. OK, we're gonna talk about my trip tomorrow to Serbia, my second time to Serbia. - Yes, your second time to Serbia. - What happened the first time? Got shot down. [explosion] Vega-31, Vega-31, going down. It's Tuesday morning, May 31, 2011 and I'm packing, getting ready for my trip to Serbia. Why don't we take a quick look around the house? Good morning, good morning, good morning, you slept the whole night through, good morning, good morning to you. - So here's Dale. He is ready to go. The bags are packed. - Bag, bag, carry, carry. He's very excited. We're all a little not excited, I think. Cause we don't like it when he goes on trips. We miss him. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Ignition, blast off. Pull the rip cord. Parachute. Parachute. Excited? Ready to go? Last minute thoughts? [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [ambient sound] I've just departed my beautiful home and my blessed family. On my way to Serbia for the second meeting, so I'm driven to go, I'm compelled to go, I must go and meet Zoltan under entirely different circumstances. So come on. Well, here I am in my nation's capital, Washington D.C. waiting for my flight and I have some very special friends that my children made sure hopped in my pocket for this journey and I have some other special friends and pocket notes. So, you thought I was traveling alone. Well, I have my whole family with me and special friends. And, of course, God. Always. I'm going to read this note from my bride. Again I'm reminded of the last time I flew across the Atlantic Ocean was in a single seat stealth fighter F117. There was no in-flight service. I have to tell the diary. We're very close to landing in Belgrade. It's very exciting. Very soon, Zoltan, I will be shaking your hand. Are we near Kovin? I'm starting to get this swell of anxiety in my chest. - Yeah, we're near, we're near. Oh boy. Is he there? Is he in his bakery? Oh, what a beautiful morning, Oh, what a beautiful day, I've got a beautiful feelin', Everything's going my way. [music] 50 meters? Really? I'm really here? [music] - Hello colonel... - Hello Zelko. - Colonel Dani. - Hi. Good to see you. - Are you have a good trip? - You too, yeah. My grandfather always said don't give anybody the wet noodle. - This is my bakery. - You got flour on your face. - Yes, because working. You working any more baker, no? - Do I do any baking? No, but you can teach me. - OK. - OK? Too much? - Slowly, slowly. Yes. OK. - How's my touch? - Very good. - Like this. - Follow you? Same? Too gentle? This is not easy. This is baker Zelko and Dani baker. - Yeah! I would like that. OK! OK. I like it. - Hello to you. Very good to meet you. - Welcome to... - Thank you. - Welcome in my house. - Thank you. - This is my son Atila. - Hello, Good to meet you. - How are you? - Good. Come in, please. [laughs] Now, try not to blow this one off. Don't shoot this one. - It's nice. And I have something for you, from the Zelko family, my wife. Several months ago, when it appeared the idea of Dale traveling to Serbia to meet Zoltan became a reality, I decided I would like to make a quilt for you as a gesture of friendship. My search included several "friendship star" patterns and I became focused on the idea of a star. A star represented so many things that are appropriate to the quilt, to this meeting of our husbands, to Dale's shoot down, etc. - So the star on your quilt represents friendship. It is my offer of friendship to you, a woman I've never met, half way around the world who is connected to me through the military shoot down of my husband's aircraft during war - Dale and I both served in our nation's Air Force because we love our country I suspect Zoltan, too, and your family feel pride in your nation. So, the star on your quilt reflects the sense of patriotism. Dale was flying his F117 aircraft at night, under the stars and the moon... - So the star on your quilt is for the night. While Dale was evading on your soil... Many people were searching for him and converging on him. There were Serbian military forces, Serbian citizens, United States rescue forces... - So the star on your quilt represents Dale, with many people converging on him. From this military event, Dale and Zoltan have become well known. Again, the star represents both Dale and Zoltan. - Across the lines of war - Across the lines of war - A friendship is born. - Friendship is born - Hence your quilt's name: Many Roads Lead to Friendship. I hope you will accept my offer of friendship and peace. I hope the quilt will warm you; if not physically, then in your heart. Enjoy! [music] [Phone ringing] OK. All right. Let's talk about that night and some of the details what I was doing and what you were doing. When it was my time for take off, off I went out of Aviano Air Base, Italy, and then flew all the way across Slovenia, flew right over the top of Ljubljana, where my grandmother and grandfather were born and raised and then into Hungary for the air-refuel. This is the navigation... speaking. We don't need navigation. My memory, we'll just go on my memory. You said the aircraft, where the aircraft came down was southeast? - And this too. - OK, so right over there. - Yeah. I'm starting to get this great wave of excitement, actually, because I've spent 12 years telling people, when I visit and share with people as a guest speaker, for 12 years I've been telling them I came down maybe a mile, a mile and a half north of Budjanovci, Serbia. So here I am. - This road now? - Yes, this. We're close, we're very close. This is a railroad track, right? Yes. - So this... - This is the road. This is the bridge. - OK. Right there is where I came down. OK. Where I came down under canopy should be right there, right there, maybe right here. So where I came down under the parachute was this close to the road and the railroad track. Slightly south of that T intersection I came down, there was a really stiff wind blowing from the southwest to the northeast, so I turned the parachute into the wind and I was drifting back like this so I landed this way. So I came down, I gathered in my parachute and I took off my harness and my helmet and I secured all of that in the bottom of a freshly plowed farm furrow. Back then, the furrows were running north-south, now they're running east-west. I remember that tree, should be right here, there should be this shallow, north-south running irrigation ditch. OK. Right here. This is it. This is it. - Here? - Right here. Right here. Yeah, see the ditch? - Nice. - Nice. - This is it, I can't believe it. - How many time you was this? - This is where I stayed the rest of the night. - Seven hours? - Yea, almost seven hours. - This is the place, yes? - This is absolutely the place and again all, all of... - You remember, absolutely remember? - How can I forget? I lived seven hours of, very intense seven hours of my life here - A helicopter? - The helicopters came in from the west and they set down right there in this field, just to the west of this ditch. They landed one rota arc away from where I was, so I came out just enough to put the signal flare, exposed myself just enough so they could see the flare. They landed right there, the pararescue men came out, grabbed me, in the helicopter and off we went. Twelve years later, here I am. I don't believe it. So I came out of ditch at that point, I was on the edge of the ditch in a farm field, in this low crouch, looking very non-threatening, with my face in the helicopter and nothing is happening. I see these two shapes approach me, they looked like aliens and I didn't see them until they were about ten feet away. The PJ, as they're called, the PJ team lead, stuff sergeant Eric Chino, was the first one to come up to me on this side and he grabs my shoulder of the jacket here and he tucks me in like this, he says "How do you feel, sir?" very loudly and noise of the helicopter, and I said "Great, let's get out of here." And he said, he said "Your PJs are here to take you home." [music] The day I was shot down, my mother was in church praying, and she came out of the church, it was a Saturday, and she got in her car and she turned on the radio and the first thing she heard on the radio was an F117 went down. And she knew it was me, she just, she knew. And... She just knew. So she went right back in church and spent several hours there. - How are you feeling? - Hey, that's my stuff! [music] Very nice shot, very nice shot. Well done, Zoltan. [music] [explosion] Zoltan, I'd like to thank you for bringing me here. It was very important for me that I connect as closely and as deeply as possible with the Serbian people. It's a great moment to just pause and reflect on exactly what you said. What really matters. What really is important... is our faith and our humanity and our respect for one another. - Indeed there are many roads to friendship [music] You're gonna be competing with the memory of my grandmother's apple strudel. Lots? Too much? Tight? Very tight? The smell is very familiar. This smells like my grandmother's apartment. [music] My grandmother would be very proud of this. [music] - This is my favourite part. OK, I'm recording. So here we are... Here I am with Zoltan and his whole family to see me off back to United States, back to my family. You can see he's recording himself. Here's the gang. [music] [Phone ringing] Hello. Here we are, off the coast of Maine. In the map, let's have a look in the map. I miss everyone in Serbia. Right there is my home, my house, my family. We're on final approach for landing in Washington D.C. We're home, we're home. We're almost home. We're almost home. We are on River Road between Goffstown and New Boston Village. [whistling] Anybody, anybody? There they are, at the door! I see Keegan. Look at that boy, he's very happy. [laughing] Hello friendly, hello nutboy. Hello. Hi boy. Where are the others? Inside? - Yeah. - Waiting? - Waiting to surprise you. Hello. [music] After we moved from the ramp at Aviano airbase, next thing is the ops group commander and several of the other leadership huddled me by, next to, a classified phone, top-secret secure phone and said General Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander forces Europe is going to call you. I thought "Wow, OK." And he did. And we're on the phone together. And one of the very first... you know, welcomed me home, glad to have you back, glad we got ya, but then the next thing he said to me was: "You're clear to go do that media thing." And so I responded to him "Actually, sir, I would like it to be just the opposite. I would, I do not want my name associated with that event, I want to stay extremely low profile." Which also shocked him, I could tell. He was silent and that my response was very unexpected to him and he then responded to me again with something like "I'm not sure you understand what I'm saying," and I think he finally realized "OK, this guy really, really means it," and he, again seemed to me frustratingly, very reluctantly said in a very annoyed tone: "Well, OK, I guess it's your call." Finally, after being up for a very, very, very long time, Colonel Bronco Stewart, who was sort of my escort, brought me back to my room and said "Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Within the next, I think he said 10 hours, maybe 12 hours, the President's gonna call you." The phone rang. So I answered the phone and this voice said "Is this the pilot?" and it made me smile. I thought, OK, the word got back to the White House calling and they don't want to even say my name across the open and unsecured line. I said "Yes, this is the pilot." He said, "This is Tony from the White House." OK, Tony, how you're doing? And he said, "Stand by for the President." What I remember most about the conversation with President Clinton is when he shared with me, and I can tell in his voice, in his manner, in his tone, how deeply, deeply relieved he was that I was rescued and not only worried for my safety in fellow American and harms way but also because what it would have meant if I have been captured, if they had the ultimate price. Anyway, when I also did ask him again for, you know I wanna stay very low profile from the media, he said "You have full White House support" [music] Quickly after he was home, it became really difficult because he wasn't ready, he just was still there. We were at two totally different places. He was so unprepared to come home and I was so needing to be there for him, he just mentally was still in Aviano and not at home. [music] [music] [music] - Where's Rowan? - Rowan's on the swing. OK, this is the ball game at the Zelkos' home, everyone come on and watch. - Come on to the ball game! - What are the teams? What are the teams? - Mommy and Keegan. Versus poppa, Mollie, Torin. - Rowan is the cheering section in the swing. - National anthem: "Oh say can't you see..." - OK, we'll shorten that. Play ball! Take me out to the ball game, take me out to the crowd, Buy me some peanuts and cracker jack, I don't care if I ever get back. This is the home school teacher and... tell us what is next. We home school and the children usually have four days a week of school at home. And the public school systems here have five days a week. And some of its sixty sharp teeth, were up to seven inches long Get a ruler and measure out seven inches. - Did I do a good job? - Yeah - You're still pleased with my tape job? [music] But now there isn't very much in my jewellry box. But I'm going to start... [inaudible conversation] Yay! Hey Keegan, hey Mollie, hey Torin, hey Rowan, hey Lauren. Isn't it a wonderful, beautiful, glorious day? Isn't it a splendiferously delightful day? Yes! Isn't it a heaven hurray thank you God playday? Yes! Isn't it oh-my-Goodness-O day? Yes! Isn't it a fiddely-faddely-foodely - fiddely day? Yeah! Here is our church. Hello church Hello community church. Give me a kiss.. It is wood stacking season. [screaming] "Zippity-doo-duh, zippity-yey, my, oh my, what a wonderful day." Good morning. It is the next morning on our way to work. I just discovered I've introduced you to my grandfather Joseph Ryan Sweeny, Pops. Another very interesting bit of his recordings. Neil Armstrong's first words as he steps on the Moon." Home again, home again, jaggedy-jag. Hurray, hurray, hurray. Oh, I really must put a new flag. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [music] - They're here! [laughs] Oh my heart. My heart. [inaudible conversation] - I'm home! - My brother! - Come on! - Oh, my brother. - Oh, Zollie. - How are you? Wonderful. So good to see you. Welcome to our home. Hello! Fantastic! - Hello - Welcome to our home! - It's so nice to meet you. It's so exciting. This is Rowan. Rowan. Torin. - It's nice to meet you. Did you meet this one? - It's very exciting, isn't it? There's somebody you haven't met yet. Rowan is going to be a big sister. We have a baby coming. Yes! - Very nice. - So meet the baby. Come on in. [inaudible conversation] - Dale, this is a special present. - One hand-made. From our ancestors. And she is giving to her, when you put it on a table, you remember us. - Thank you for passing that on to us. Beautiful! It's from natural cotton so that's why it is... - Oh it's beautiful. - that gray colour. - This has been in the family? - 50 years it's been in the family. - Oh, it's beautiful. [laughs] A hah! Yeah yeah. - Nice. - You know? I know. - What is this? It's a SA-3. - Yes. Neva. Neva, yeah. From Zoltan to Dale. That's nice. This is the collection of aircraft that represents my flying career in the force, I did other things besides flying. These are all aircraft that I flew. This is the missing peace from the collection so it needs to be in a place of honor, I think so. - This is complete, yes? - Perfect. - And now this is our collection, yes. - Yes, and now the collection is complete. - It is complete. - This was the missing piece. - Yes, yes, yes. This is the missing piece. It's complete. OK. For me the emotion started when he left for war because I knew that he'd be flying very dangerous missions and that there was a good chance that something would happen to him, so the day that he was shot down for me was more about noontime that he got shot down and I had been in my house, lying on my couch and, before they called, and I was crying and just praying that God would keep him safe and... 13 years and I'm still crying, it's crazy. Because I know you understand, it's so frightening, there's so much fear to know that your husband's in danger and I can imagine for you It's so unimaginable to me the terror of that. I... it's... Oh, people shouldn't have to go through that, shouldn't have to live that way. Ah, I don't... I'm speechless; I don't know what to say about that I feel. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you had to live through that and I'm certain that you, that feeling of fear never goes away, that's in your heart and will always come back over and over. Family is everything; it's just everything in our lives is our family. Oh, I'm glad you're here. [music] So, what do you think about my father and your father were in a war and against each other, and now you and me are playing? How do you feel about that? What's on your mind? - It's incredible. How many? - Eight. - Eight? My gosh! How many of each? How many girls? How many boys? - Two boys and six girls. I also have two other children from a previous marriage, previous life I guess, you could say. Ryan, and then I have another daughter Gina. Sadly, we just became very far apart from each other in very recent years and right now we don't have any contact between us, which is pretty sad. You know there is a piece of my heart that is just missing and someday if we reconnect, that would be wonderful, if some day these five children and those two children come back together and know each other and have each other as family, that would give me great joy and pleasure. - Maybe this is another chance? - - Maybe. Maybe. I think about them every day and wonder how they're doing. - Maybe this is another chance? - And maybe for you? - Maybe. Who knows? You pilot and I copilot. Maybe. Who know? Cheers! To family! - Yes, to family and new... Faith and family. - Yes, and new chance. - Yeah, yeah. Woow! [music] [phone rings] [phone rings] [music]
