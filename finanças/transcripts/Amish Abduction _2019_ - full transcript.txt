Caleb? Get up, my boy. Help your mother in the kitchen. Caleb? Caleb! Caleb! Caleb! -But I already gave you 20 dollars. -It's not enough. I don't need the best kind, Mr. Wilson. Any whiskey will do. Well, then give me another 20. Why? Because, it's a helluva job gettin' booze for you all the damn time. Hell, I do this for you, kid. But earlier you said it was just gonna be ten more. Yeah? It's called inflation... You know, you're not the only person we can use. Oh... so, it's gonna be like that? Mr. Wilson... Don't you Mr. Wilson me, you little weasel. When you come back to me, and I know you will, I want you to know my fee just doubled. Farm boy playing hardball... Ain't that something? Damn fool. Poppa! Hello, Caleb. Welcome home, Jacob. Annie. It's been a long day... I'm starving. Well, dinner's ready. Honey, could you please... What? Your hands... My apologies. Jacob? Caleb, would you please say grace? Let's make it short and sweet tonight, son. I'm hungry. Dear Blessed Father... Thank you for this delicious meal tonight, amen. Amen! That's it? We said amen. Give me your plate. So how was work today, Poppa? Long, tiring. But meaningful and important, and... Boring. Excuse me? What? It is boring. Same thing, every blessed day. Caleb, don't listen to your father... What he's saying is not proper. Not proper? Did you get a chance to fix the support beam in the barn? I'm afraid it's going to fall any minute now. No, I didn't. Poppa asked you to. I'll get to it, Annie. Poppa asked you two weeks ago... For God's sake woman, enough! You're worse than your father. Your father's just tired, honey. Yes, I am tired. I'm tired of the same routine. Every day: fix this, plow that... There's a big world out there, Annie. Jacob Baker! Don't you... Don't you ever look out on the highway? Don't you ever wonder? No, I don't. I don't believe you. There's more to life than just this village. Annie, out there with the English... I believe if we had an English doctor, our baby would still be alive. Your son is right here. So what? It's good for him to hear me speak honestly. Isn't that right, son? It's okay, Momma. No, it's not okay. What your father is saying is devil talk. Annie... Plowing the fields and fixing the barn is God's work. We count on one another in this village, do you hear me? It's a righteous thing. Right, Jacob? Your mother's right, Caleb. She's always right. Where are you going? I forgot to tie up Sally, she's loose in the barn. But we're still eating. I've got more of God's work to finish. Caleb, eat your dinner. Momma? I'll be right back. Annie? Everything all right? Momma, Poppa, would you mind watching Caleb for a few minutes? Yes, of course. What is it? I just need to check on something. I'll be right back. Caleb! Grandma and Grandpa want to see you. Caleb, dear, come inside. Your Momma will be back in a minute. Come on! Jacob? Oh, look who's come crawling back. Samuel, is that you? I see you brought Farmer Ted with you as well. My name is Jacob. Well, Farmer Ted, as I told your little friend here, my prices are double now. Which is why I'm here. It isn't fair. I've got the money. Let me do the talking, Samuel. Do you have the bottle? Not so fast. This stuff is top shelf. You got the money? What is the meaning of this? Half of it is gone. I had a little taste. What? Why? Because I felt like it. Samuel, give the bottle back. The deal is off. Samuel? Samuel! The deal is off, we're not paying for half a bottle. Mr. Baker, it's... it's still better than nothing. Give me back the money. I said give me the money back. No sir... Don't stand between your friend and his whiskey. See that? The boy likes it. Let's go, Mr. Baker. It's fine... I'm not gonna tell you again. Give me the money back. Or what? You gonna hit me? You fight and drink now? Mr. Baker? Go on back to the village. Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. You aren't leaving until I get that money back. I will not stand for anyone taking advantage of my friends. You Amish don't realize how hard it is to get whiskey out here. And you are trying to cheat honest men. Honest men? You sure don't seem like an honest man. I think you're a bad Amish. You ain't even supposed to drink, you're supposed to do chores and make babies. You're Farmer Ted, the deadbeat daddy. My name is Jacob. Your name is Farmer Ted! You do not know the first thing about me, but I will tell you this: my name is Jacob Baker and you will not call me Farmer Ted again! Farmer... friggin'... Ted! Hey... Get up! I said, get up! Where have you been? I told you... I was tying up Sally in the barn. Jacob, I checked the barn... Annie! It's been a long day... Caleb is asleep. Can you please be quiet? I'm going to bed. Do you still love him? I don't know anything anymore, Momma. We all know that Jacob is not perfect, but dear, who are we to judge? Only the Lord reserves that right. But, I'm his wife. And an Amish wife has a duty to serve her husband. Haven't I taught you anything? So just ignore his transgressions? Is that what I do? No, not ignore them. Help him. Help him see the error of his ways. I've tried, Momma... Well, you need to try harder. I try every day, but whatever I do, it's just not enough. Jacob is becoming more and more disconnected... I'm at wit's end, Momma. I don't know what to do anymore... What does that mean? What? We are not like the English. We are not heathens. If you find yourself on rocky shores, you have a duty to serve your husband. But he's not the man that I married. Where does this leave Caleb? Where does it leave me? You are a family. Annie, your husband is obviously going through some difficulties. But with God's grace, he will steer him back towards the righteous path. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, please give Annie the strength to help Jacob back to the fold. Amen. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. Excuse me. Afternoon, Miss Annie. Good afternoon, Thomas. How are you? I'm good. Just getting ready for winter, as we all are. Thomas, did you see your brother this morning? No, I haven't seen Jacob today... He must be out doing field duty. Yes... must be. Very well... enjoy your afternoon. You as well, Annie. Timmy, Hannah, where's Caleb? He left. What? He left this morning with Mr. Baker. Jacob? Caleb? Caleb? Caleb! Annie, what's wrong? Jacob took Caleb out of school this morning. What do you mean? I mean I don't know where they are. Don't worry Annie, I'm sure they're close by. Caleb? Caleb! Caleb! Has anyone seen Caleb? Anyone? Samuel! Do you know where they went? Me? Yes, you. Mrs. Baker, I don't... Momma! Caleb! Where have you been? You scared me. Poppa and I had the most amazing day ever! We went to the country fair, and we went on the rides, and we had popcorn, and cotton candy! Mmm-hmm. And guess what? Poppa won me this amazing hat. He had to throw a ball and he knocked down all the pins and... Caleb, I want you to go back and clean up for dinner, okay? I need to talk to your father. Go on, son. Would you like to explain yourself? You're not even going to apologize? Apologize for what? For what? You pulled Caleb out of school and took him to an amusement park without telling me? He learned more today with me than he ever would have in school. It was like an early Rumspringa. Caleb is eight years old! Do you know how confusing this is for him? Just because you never decided to visit the English, doesn't mean it is a bad place. What is the crime, Annie? I spent a wonderful day with my son. He's our son! That's awfully big of you to admit that. Good afternoon, folks. I'm Officer Peterson. How are you? Good afternoon. How might we help you? Well, we found a dead body a mile up the road. Oh, dear. Yeah, his name was Wilson Miller. 55 year old Caucasian male. Just wondering if anyone here knew him, or saw anything suspicious, being so close to the village and all. I don't believe so. He certainly does not look familiar to me. Officer, I don't believe that we can help you. We tend to stick to ourselves around here. Yeah, I'm aware of that. So... No one's seen him? No one? No? Ma'am? What's your name? Annie. Hi, Annie. Have you seen this man before? No. Okay, well... Here's my card. If you happen to think of anything or remember anything that might be helpful, please give me a call, okay? Thank you, officer. Probably got into a fight with a driver. Well, have a nice afternoon. Annie? What are you still doing up? Waiting for you. You've been drinking. So what? Nothing wrong with a drink now and again. Jacob, what's happened to you? Was Samuel with you, too? Enough with the questions. Jacob, please... Just forget all that. I want to show you something... What is it? They call it a smartphone. This thing, can you believe it? But it's more than a phone. Where did you get this? Look, it can even show you where there's a store, or even the weather forecast! Jacob... We have one clunky phone for the entire village and it can't do any of these things. Well... I have one for you as well. These will make our lives so much better. We don't need this. Can't it just sometimes be about something we want? Well, then I don't want this... We're getting by just fine. But there's more to life than just getting by. And this is only the beginning. There are so many things out there waiting for us. Waiting for us? Annie... There is an exciting world amongst the English. I'm telling you, you have no idea. We have been doing God's work, and what have we gotten in return? We can't even have a second child. I want to live with the English. And I want you and Caleb to be a part of it with me. I don't even know what to say to you. Say yes, Annie... Let's explore the English world together. It's a world of pain and impurity. Annie... I'm not going to subject myself, let alone my son, to that world. Don't defy me, woman! I want Caleb to see the real world. No, you leave him out of this and don't pretend for one second that any of this is about him. He is my son as much as he is yours! He is a sweet boy and I won't let you corrupt him with your foolish fantasies. You are the one that lives in a fantasy, Annie. Do you have any idea what the English say about us behind our backs? We are laughing stocks! I don't care! And if you were a good man, you wouldn't care either. But you are not the man that I married! You are a disgrace! Oh, Annie... How could you? I'm so sorry... I've just been... I've been so confused lately... I... Annie... I would never hurt you. You're scaring me. I'm sorry. That's so sad about that English man out by the road. The one who died. Yes... The police officer said he had no family. That's so sad, don't you think? Everyone needs a family. Jacob? Do you have anything else you need to tell me? Annie, all you need to know is that everything will be fine. Jacob? Caleb? Has anyone seen my son? Has anyone seen Caleb? Poppa, Momma, is Caleb with you? No, dear. Samuel! Morning, Mrs. Baker. I know you know where they are! Don't you lie to me! Where is my boy? Answer me! Child! Samuel... Please. Mr. Baker has your son. What do you mean? Where are they now? They left for the city... real early this morning. Didn't say when they'd be coming back. Here... Mr. Baker wrote it and asked me to give it to you. Dear Annie, there's much more to life than what you are willing to see. I love you, but Caleb deserves a normal life, and that's what I plan to give him. It's what I deserve, too. I met a generous man named Richard Johnson. He's an English lawyer and agrees with me that the Amish way of life is... abusive to a child. He is helping me get custody of Caleb. If you fight me on this, Annie, you will regret it. A good Amish wife would've followed her husband when given the chance. The court papers will be delivered to you tomorrow. Jacob. Let's get her inside. Annie, you really must try to eat something. I'm not hungry. I think what is best for now is that we continue to wait. We wait for them to come home. I've been waiting for three whole days. So I should just wait, and do nothing? No... Not do nothing - you will pray. We are a family - we will pray. I have been praying, but it's just... It's not enough. I'm sorry, but I can't sit here any longer knowing that my son is out there with that man. That man with your son is still your husband. Momma? I agree with Annie. She has to take action, she needs to find her boy. But what does our Annie know about English life? She can't just go out there alone. She can try. Our child wouldn't even know where to begin. Poppa, I'm sitting right here. I can speak for myself. Well... then speak. I will to go to the city and I will bring my boy home. He needs me. She's right, John. The letter from the Pennsylvania court in Philadelphia... It says that I have to appear in two days for the custody hearing. I have to be there. John... She has no choice. We wait for God's choice. Poppa... You don't know Jacob the way that I do. He has a terrible temper. He's not like you. I choose Thomas to accompany you. Thomas? Makes sense. He's a good man, he's Jacob's brother and he will know how to look out for you. And you will need some money. Yes, we... We have some money, and... Just in case. Thank you, Poppa. First thing tomorrow, I will take you to Lancaster and then you will find a taxi cab to take you the rest of the way. Annie. I have faith in you. You are a wonderful mother. Thomas... What are you doing out here? This is my favorite place. For thinking, praying, looking up at the stars. It's a good place. Yes, it is. My father told you about tomorrow? Yes, he did. Are you feeling ready? As ready as I'll ever be, I guess... I don't know what I'm doing. I'm so proud of you, Annie... You're very brave. Thank you. We should get some sleep. Yes. May I walk you home? It's okay, I know my way around these parts. Sleep well, Annie. You too. You two be careful out there. The English world is very different than ours. Don't worry, Momma. I'll watch out for Annie. -Off we go. -Off you go! - Whoo! Coming through! Should we go inside the hotel? Let's not do that quite yet. Okay, what do you suggest we do instead? Oh no... no, no, no! C'mon! No Annie, we talked about this. Jacob's house is off limits. It's not Jacob's house, it's his lawyer's, remember? Nevertheless Annie, you're asking for trouble. I just want to see it. Excuse me? I don't really know how to use this, but I'm trying to search for the name Richard Johnson. -And that's close by? -Oh yes! Thank you. He searched Richard's name and found his address! And it's close by! Annie... I'm not going to do anything, I just... I need to see where my son has been living, Thomas. Do you understand? Okay, I guess I do. And we can leave our suitcases here! Thank you! Thomas Baker, thank you. Thank you. I really don't think we should be here. What if someone sees us, huh? What if somebody's home? It looks empty. Annie! Please wait for us. So this is what he left me for? You have to admit, it's very beautiful. I guess, if you like gluttony. It's so different. Wow, look at the color of the water! It's so strange. Annie! Hello? Yes, I know. Yes, I know. Okay well, we'll meet at the restaurant and go over everything then. Okay. Yes, we'll see you in a couple of hours. Richard? Thank you for having us here. You're a good man. Okay, bye. Caleb? Please go now, hurry! Momma? Momma! What's going on now, Caleb? I thought I heard Momma, is she here? No. No, she's not here. We've been over this. You probably just heard the neighbors. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Son, your momma - she's chosen a life that we don't belong in. That's not true, she loves us. If she loves us, why isn't she here? Why is she not with us? Maybe she's out there, lost and looking for us. Listen, listen... Son, your momma... She isn't coming. She's never coming here, you need to know that. You need to understand that. Why are you still wearing these ridiculous clothes, hmm? Put on the things that we bought at the store yesterday. I don't want to. If you go out wearing those things, people are going to laugh at you. Is that what you want? I like these clothes, Poppa. No - no you don't! You only think that you do. Here, put this on. Pick that up and put it on, now! You will respect your father and do as I say. Put it on! I want my momma! ... , boy! Sorry, Poppa. I know you are... I know. Go... go watch some television. Do something that normal people do. Hey... it's not as easy as it looks. I didn't say it looks easy. You should try. I don't think so. C'mon, Annie, try it. You're doing great! I did it! I think I'm getting the hang of it! -Thank you. -Thank you. There's paper in this cookie. What does it say? "If you never give up on love, then love will never give up on you." You should try yours. What's it say? "Face your future without fear." That's a very wise cookie. Wow... Pretty fancy. It's a music player! ♪ Looking for another How do I... I thought there would be two beds. I think it's less money this way. It's okay, yeah, this will work fine. What are you doing? I'm going to sleep in here. What? You can't do that. Of course I can. It'll be just fine. Well then... here. Take these extra blankets and pillows. I certainly don't need four pillows. Thank you, Annie. You know, Thomas, maybe you should take the bed. I can sleep in there. Don't be ridiculous. You have a big day tomorrow. You need your rest. Yes... A really big day. Thomas? Yes, Annie? I want you to sleep in here. But it's not proper. Don't be silly, you'll be sleeping on the floor. I don't think I'll get much sleeping done tonight. You're worried about tomorrow? Yes, a little... Well, if I'm being honest, a lot. You're going to be fine. Try to get some sleep. Good night, Annie. Good night, Thomas. Hope you like purple. Caleb? Caleb, it's me! I know I look different, but it's me. Excuse me ma'am, back up. You're scaring my son. He's our son. Caleb, you must remember your momma. I'm not going to tell you again, lady. No, Caleb, please. You have to come home to me, I miss you. If you do not back up, I'm calling the police. Daddy, I'm scared! No, don't be scared. Momma's here. Caleb - you need to come home. I'm never coming home! I just had a bad dream. I'm sorry for startling you. I'm just... I'm just nervous. You'll see your boy tomorrow. Yes, I will. Well, this is it. It's so big. I'm sure it seems smaller on the inside. I don't know if I can do this. Just remember what we talked about. Speak from the heart and justice will be served. It's God's will. Excuse me. Hello, My name is Annie, and we are here for... Ah, the Amish trial. Well, I can tell you where to go because I'll be hearing your case. Thank you for listening. Right. I'm your judge... follow me. It's a pleasure to meet you. Nowadays, most cases don't even make it into the courtroom. Most of the time, you meet with a retired judge or a mediator. Why is that? Too many cases. Can't hear them all. We'd be here day and night. Oh, I see. Anyway, we're in Room 101 when you're ready. Face your future without fear. Momma! Caleb! I missed you so much. Okay, let's get started. Please, everyone take your seats. I love you. I love you, too. Caleb, sit here. Annie... Just remember, speak from the heart. After hearing all the testimony this afternoon, and weighing all the factors, I must say that my decision is finally made. Mrs. Baker... While I find the Amish lifestyle rather unusual to say the least, and certainly not my cup of tea, I know a good mother when I see one. Thank you, your honor. You've proven to be very dedicated to the best interests of your son, and Caleb clearly has great affection for you. A mother's love is a very special thing for a young boy. Mr. Baker... I know you think what you're doing with your son is the right thing. Absolutely, your Honor. But taking him away from his mother, pulling him from school, taking him from his home the way that you did with no consent from Mrs. Baker was reckless, and worse yet, in violation of several Pennsylvania statutes. I understand, your honor... I'm not finished yet. In addition, your disorderly conduct citation stemming from public intoxication on July 27th... Objection, your honor, irrelevant. My client was never formerly charged. Was he not arrested? Yes, but he was never charged. I don't care, counselor. Poor judgment and reckless behavior does not comport with raising a child. Your honor, that officer had it out for me. There was no interest in the truth. That may be, but the incident on the 27th is not what's on trial here today. Then why the hell are you bringing it up right now, huh? Excuse me, sir? Counselor, you better get your client under control, or a custody hearing will be the least of his concerns. Jacob, you need to calm down. In the custody hearing of Caleb Baker, I have decided that Mrs. Annie Baker, mother of the child, is awarded sole custody. Praise God! And Caleb will return with his mother to her place of residence, immediately. Your honor, you cannot be serious. Look at her... look at her! She can't provide him what I can provide him. Mr. Jacob Baker is restricted to supervised visitation rights, but only at the Amish Village, at mutually agreed upon times, two weekends out of the month. ... , do something, Richard! Relax Jacob, this isn't helping. We'll file an appeal. Get back here, Caleb! Mr. Baker! I don't care what that judge says, you are my son! Jacob, please. You're gonna regret this, Annie. Counselor! Settle down your client. I'm trying, your honor. -Jacob... -Don't touch me! Bailiff, please restrain this man. Come on Caleb, come on. Caleb, my boy, I was so worried about you. I missed you so much. I missed you more! I couldn't have done this without you. It was my pleasure. Jacob? What do you want? It's over. Nothing's over, Annie. Thomas... Did you honestly think I would go to all this trouble just to let you steal what is rightfully mine? Are you trying to steal my wife and my son? Is that what this is? You're way out of line here! Do you think I am stupid, Thomas? I see the way you two look at each other. Come on Thomas, let's go. Annie... I miss you. I imagine you in English clothes. Stop it! Can't a husband speak to his wife? I said, stop it. That's enough, Jacob! Who's gonna stop me, Thomas? You? Jacob! Somebody, help! Poppa! Stop it, please, you're going to kill him! Hey buddy! I've called the police! I'm coming back for you, Annie! Thomas? Thank goodness. Annie? I'm so sorry that this happened to you. It's... it's okay. No, it's not okay. I should never have gotten you involved in this mess. Can I get you anything? Did you want to try to drink something, or... Did you need more ice? You need to go. What? I'm not just going to leave you here... Annie, trust me. Jacob he, he won't stop. But you... Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Okay. Let's go home. Get better, uncle Thomas. I will. You listen to your Momma, you hear me? You do everything she tells you to, okay? Okay. Thanks for helping us. Okay. Come on, hurry! Quick, go... run! Get in, quick. Please go now! Hurry! Caleb! Momma, what's wrong? Go get your father. Okay. Poppa! Poppa! Poppa! Poppa! Poppa! Poppa! Poppa! Momma needs you. It's the baby... Annie! Momma! Jacob... Annie. You're too late. Our heavenly father is taking good care of him now. We lost him. Come on, let's get you out of the cold. Caleb? Get up, my boy. Help your mother in the kitchen. Caleb! Caleb! Oh, thank God... Momma? What's wrong? Are you boys okay? Yeah, Momma. Yeah, we're just playing. Caleb, Timmy, why don't you come out of here now? Do we have to, Mrs. Baker? Yes. Come on, boys. Wait up! Can I go to Timmy's house? You know... I think it's best that you stay with me today, okay? -Bye, Caleb. -Bye. Let's just stick close together today and catch up. Are you okay, Momma? Yes, Momma's fine. I just missed you so much. Poppa! Annie! Oh, thank God you're okay. We heard about everything that happened. Thomas is badly hurt. Caleb told us. He is a very good boy. He did not want to wake up his momma this morning while she was sleeping. We got a call from the hospital. Thomas is going to recover. Child... How are you? I'm... What is everyone doing here? We can't find Samuel. What? He's been missing since last night. So we're spreading out and searching the fields. Actually, I think I have an idea. Caleb, I want you to go to Grandma and Grandpa's, okay? We won't be long. If Samuel's missing, then I want to help find him. Caleb, I want you to go to Grandma's. Fast as you can, please. Follow me. Annie, where are we going? Just a little further. Samuel? Samuel? Samuel! What are you doing? Stop it! Samuel, what's gotten into you? He's drunk, Poppa. Yeah Poppa, I'm drunk. Could you men please help take Samuel home now? I told Mr. Baker, he should've never taken him. I told him it was wrong to take a boy from his mother. I know you did. And I told him again. What do you mean you told him again? When? Last night. Last night? Yup, and you know what? He gets it now. Is that so? Yes ma'am. Mr. Baker said he's sorry and he was gonna go back to the city. And he wanted me to be sure to tell you, that he was sorry about what he'd done. That's what he said? Isn't that great? Annie? That man is still your husband despite everything that's happened. Despite everything that's happened? Annie! We will be reasonable. You took your vows under the eyes of the Lord, and we will not break those vows. Child... It would destroy your mother and me if you were shunned from this community. If my community wants to shun me for protecting my son from an abusive man, then I want nothing to do with my community. They can hear you! Good. It's about time they started to listen to the women in this town. Do any of you have anything to say to me about the way I should honor my husband? Unless you have walked in my shoes do not dare judge me. Take him home. Annie, Jacob... Jacob is a threat. No, he's just confused... He is dangerous! He is dangerous, Poppa! And if you can't see that through all of this then I don't know what to say to you. Annie... No. I need you at my side. Standing by me, fighting for me. The choice is yours. Where are you going? Home. To protect my child. C'mon Caleb, time to go. Did you find Samuel? Yes, I found him alright. Bye, Grandma! So what are we doing? Well, for starters, you can help me with dinner, my boy. It's nice to be home. Caleb, what is it? Do you think Poppa will stay with the English? I'm not sure. What do you think? I think he likes it out there... More than being with us. I think your father is not entirely sure what he likes right now. Something I realized a long time ago is that the things that fill your heart are never the things you can buy. It's being here in our home, together, amongst our family... That's the real joy in life. Bet you're tired, huh? A little bit. We had a really long couple of days. Can you sleep in my room tonight? Why? Are you scared, Caleb? No... No, it's just that we haven't done that in awhile. Of course. I'll go get ready and brush my teeth and then can you come in when you're done? Okay, let me just finish up here. Okay, I'm in bed! Okay, I'm coming. What hymn is that, Momma? Good night, Caleb. Good evening, Annie. You shouldn't be here, Jacob. This is my house. And that's my boy. Not anymore... on either count. You lost that privilege the day you took your first drink. And you lost your family the day you kidnapped Caleb. You got a little fire in your belly now. That's good, you've changed. That's good. Well, you didn't give me much choice, Jacob. Deserting us the way you did. It doesn't have to be this way, Annie. I'm afraid it does. Poppa? I'm not going to let you take what is rightfully mine. We aren't your property. Do not push me. Go away, or I will call the police. You wouldn't dare. No? I have Officer Peterson's phone number and I'm sure she would be very interested in talking to you. You brazen bitch... Get out of my house! This is my house, and you are not welcome here. I said, get out! Or what, Annie? Poppa, stop! I asked you a question. The answer is nothing. You Amish are all the same. All talk, no action! Get away from us. Come on Caleb, you're coming with me. Let go of him! You're hurting me! I want to stay here! Let go of him! Caleb, run! Caleb! Keep going, run! Hey! Run to the barn, I'll be right behind you. Annie! Come on... Go! Caleb, it's father. Come here, buddy. Annie! Run Caleb, run! Caleb! You're coming with me, Caleb. No, he's not! Please, no! Please, let her be. Momma, no! Let her go! No Poppa, please! Poppa? -Poppa? -Annie? Poppa! Someone go for the phone. We're going to need some help. 911, what is your emergency? I need you to try this for me. Oh... sure. Not bad. Really? Not great either. What do you think it might be missing? Uh, some love? Salt, for starters. Lord knows what you've been feeding yourself these past two years. Well, no one ever taught me how to cook. You don't say... Fine, I'll add some extra salt, and maybe a dash of love. A smart cookie once said, "If you never give up on love..." "Then love will never give up on you." I... I kept it. All right, everyone. Let's eat.
