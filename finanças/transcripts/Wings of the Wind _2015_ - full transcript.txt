(soft instrumental music) - Lord... How did you make the Heavens and the Earth? If you made everyone and everything, why do bad things happen? To teach us a lesson? You're God of the universe. Aren't you in control? Nothing to say? - [Man] Rose! - I'll just talk to a bird. - Hiding out in the field again? - Not hiding, hiking. - Right. - I was having a great conversation with a bird. - I don't think you'll be finding the answers in the field. - Well Jesse, you provide no more answers than the bird. - I'm your cousin. I don't need to provide answers. I think I'll leave that for the birds. - New bird? - Yeah. just came in today. Think you can check it out? - Did you call me or not? - Must have been a bird. (soft violin music) (car approaching) - You expecting something? - Come on. Did you get them? - Get what? - You know what I'm talking about. - Oh, that! Maybe I did get them. - I knew it! - What? No, those aren't for you. I couldn't find you any. - I love them, Wes. - Well, I suppose you should start planning your first hike. - Yes, but Stephen says violin must come first. - When did you start playing the violin? - Yesterday! (soft piano music) - Why'd you take off back at the hangar? - You made it pretty clear you didn't want to talk. Besides, I'm sure your talk with the birds was very monumental. - You're always challenging me to talk. Well, now dear cousin, I'm ready to talk. - Are you really? 'Cause it looks like you're just looking to pass the blame. - I know where to pass the blame. - You can't blame God for your brother leaving. - Everyone I'm close to takes off. - Choices were made, Rose. - Gotta fly. - Who's leaving now? Rose. - When did you get back in town? - Just now. Why are you walking? - 'Cause I'm not flying. - No wings today? - No, every single bird is in the shop. - Where we off to? - I got no place to be. - I got an idea. - We don't want to go looking at birds. - It's called birding, and I have something a little more profitable in mind. - Whoa, I haven't seen a stack of cash like that-- - Keep your hands off. - Where'd you get it? - Just drive. (thunder crashing) - Now, I'll cover you guys tonight, but next time you're bringing your own stake. - No thanks. not me. - Yeah, I don't know, Seth. - Don't get in a lather about it, Jesse. It's ten sawbucks, five card draw, no limit. - A hundred bucks is high stakes, Seth. - We'll be at the same table and I'll clean it. No risk. - C'mon, Jesse. We don't do this. - I know. We can't just leave him here. - Well, I'll be in the car. - What a bunch of losers. - I'm out too. - You're back in now. - No, you know what? I'm not doing this. This can't be controlled. - Um, I look pretty in control. - Pay your fees and let's go, all right? - You go ahead. I'll catch a ride home. (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) (breathing heavy) (inaudible voices) (suspenseful music) - You're going to be part of the hiking competition, right? I'm looking forward to competing against you. You gonna help Charlie with mapping out the event? C'mon, Rose. You know all the great birding areas. What's up with you? - The dream again. Bread for stones. Snakes for fish. It makes no sense. - It just tells me you've got hiking on your mind. You know, stones and snakes? (soft music) - Hat, extra socks, towels. - I'll take the flashlight and bird books. - And I'll pack the canned beans for lunch. - Mirror. - I'm gonna need a first aid kit by the time I'm done with this girl. - Good idea. We do need a first aid kit. - Why can't we take the mirror? - The key is to consolidate only needed items into the packs. - I guess that eliminates Josie's wardrobe over there. - Hey! These are needed. Why do you have that huge blanket? - This is something we may need. To cover up with or for shelter. We don't need four outfits. - What if I get dirty or wet? - You'll dry! - Hey! I think we should leave out the outfits and the blanket. It's only a two day hike and the cabin will have blankets, so let's just stick to the essentials. Also, we need to start training with our packs. - Why? - Because it's extra weight. - Mine doesn't weigh anything at all. - It's empty, you knuckle head. - Cool it! Now obviously we will need canteens, notepads and extra food packs. - Don't forget Aunt Ella's sweet potato biscuits. - You'd think of that. - What? - You realize you sound like a chicken clucking when you do that, right? - So dad, what do you think? - I think not. - Dad, this is unfair. I can fly a plane as good as any man and you know it. - That's not the point. This isn't about any man. - Well, it's about me, if you haven't noticed that. - I am fully aware. - You can't avoid the inevitable. - Tomorrow the answer will still be no. - I'm a pilot, dad. Whether you like it or not. I can fly this plane. - You're not ready yet. You're just trying to prove yourself. - You can't protect me by not letting me fly. - I'm not doing that. I'm just saying no. You're not going to fly this or any other plane right now. - I have Seth to blame for this, don't I? - No, it's just that your attitude is getting in the way of your judgment as a pilot. Walking away never solved anything, Rose Cornell. - Mom and Seth are gone! I'm not! Doesn't that matter? (soft music) - Everything here looks fine. - I don't know what happened to cause the drop in engine power. I've missed something somewhere. I just don't know what it is. If Rose wasn't a good pilot, she would have crashed and it would have been my fault. - It's not about you. - I talked to Jenkins down at the garage. He's pretty interested in hiring you. - Not yet. - He's a good man. He'll treat you fair and he'll pay you good. - I've got a plan. - You're a good pilot. And a great mechanic. You need to get over what happened. - I'm not really interested in that. I'm not doing that again. - You know that book is not going to help you. - What? This book is great. - That guy was convicted of gambling last year and you need to stay clear of him. - He was acquitted. - I'm telling you, pushing me away is not going to pay off. You need to face this issue and talk to me. - No, dad. I don't need to talk to you. - The problem is you're not talking to anyone right now. - I talk to people who get me. Everyone around here only puts me down. - The way you see things aren't the way they are. (paintbrush strokes) - Any success, Ruby? - Yeah, there's a second floor above the hiking club. - That sounds perfect. And they seem interested in an art gallery? - Yeah, they really seem to like it. They want to see some more samples. - Josie helped me pick some out. - She's become quite the little assistant, hasn't she? - I'm gonna display some of her work. - I think I'll hold a fashion show to promote the showing. (suspenseful music) - Ten bucks. that's all I have. I thought you were in control. - I was just having a weak moment. - They call them winning streaks for a reason. They end. - Never borrow money from the people running the game. You can't be more stupid. - I know. - Who's the loser now? - Look, if I don't pay it back, I'm in trouble. I have to pay it. I know you guys don't have a lot of money, but I'll win it back and more after I pay off the debt. - Dry up, Seth. - Ease up, Jesse. - You guys really don't have anymore cash? - What do we look like? your bank? - What are we gonna do? - Not we. you. - Okay, cool down. We'll figure something out. I'll get some of my Aunt Ella's bakery money to pay him. (radio music playing) (changing radio stations) - [Radio Evangelist] Welcome to the national radio evangelism hour. This is evangelist james brayden. I've just returned from an enjoyable time of bird watching. I've spotted 352 species this year. As I've traveled evangelistically throughout the US, I've taken time for my favorite hobby, and I've learned a kingdom principle through this hobby. That is, let's not be too soon satisfied. The Bible tells us when we seek him, we find the kingdom. and all things are added to us. Things you have never dreamed or imagined are yours simply by receiving them. As a young boy, I grew up in the countryside in the late 1800s. I was always seeking the Lord. I went into the fields to look for as many birds as I could find, and the Lord would guide me. I found his faithfulness is rich with blessing as I've asked and sought him like a child to receive. I would always stop to ask for his guidance. - Lord, help me find as many birds nests as I can. There were times when I knew where at least 80 to 90 nests were. - [Radio Evangelist] Even today, he leads me and reveals his goodness to me. I have come to know that it is the Lord who desires to bless us, reveal himself to us and show us what we do not understand. I would find nests abandoned by the mother and adopt them. I would bring them home with me and set them near my window. The Lord would bring birds to fly through the open window of my room, and they would begin feeding the young ones while I watched them. I have seen that it is he who cares for the sparrow. It is he who comes to those who seek him. It is he who answers a childlike faith. It is he who comes through the open window of a desiring heart. He is the one who heals the broken. He loves the unlovable. He forgives the unforgivable. He is the one our hearts hunger for. He is the author of our faith. (knock at door) (turns radio off) - Rose, what are you doing? - Nothing of any importance. Just getting my things together. - I'm leaving for the bradford's. I'm training for the hiking competition with Josie and Phoebe. - I'll meet you there. - I brought the hiking commission's new director of competition a gift. - Great, but you just call me Charlie. - Planning the competition? - These are perfect for planning a hike. - Yeah. it's going to be swell. I'm including some pretty challenging terrain. - Everyone's pretty keen on it. - I'm sure they are. And you are a competitor, so no peeking. - Okay. - What did you bring to bribe me? - Oh, nothing. Just Aunt Ella's baked goodies, and my great cup of coffee. I'm helping Aunt Ella plan the hiking club winners event. - I'm excited about helping you, Charlie. - I'm excited about the hike. - You two are something else. - Don't you think Josie should know how to use a compass if she plans to enter a 20 mile hiking competition? - I suppose. - So you agree I should put a stop to it? - That's a great idea. a stop watch. - That settles that. - I received a new hat today. I'll have to show you. - Okay, so tomorrow. church or not? - Not. I don't need to hear about how God allowed something bad to happen to someone to teach him a lesson. I don't want to serve a God like that. But I do like teaching my Sunday school class. - Don't you think you should go to church then? - Look at this. - Let me see. - I'm telling you Steve, there's nothing like winning, and this book will make you a winner. - I'm not a gambler, Seth. And stop calling me Steve. - It's gravy. here, I'll show you how. - Look, ever since I was a kid-- - I know, I know. - You make a great cousin but-- - No buts, Steve. - Look, I think you've got a gambling problem. - I can stop any time I want. - Stop now then. - It's not the right time. I've got to get my dad's money back first. - That's just an excuse to keep gambling. You know uncle cliff doesn't care about the money. - Just forget it, Stephen. - Wait a minute. - Oh, swell, Josie. You stop every ten minutes to fix your boots. - How are we are ever gonna make a 20 mile competition? - I won't have a problem once I get these adjusted to my feet. - Right. - Really phoebe, they will adjust. - If you don't get a ton of blisters before then. - How many miles have we gone today? - One. - Oh. - We've been at this for two hours and only gone a mile? Now I have to leave. I told Rose I'd be home by now. - Well, I guess she's gone. - There. I'm ready. - Finally. - Ow. Ow. - Let's go! (groaning) - How much training do we need to do? - I say everyday. We need to get in some good conditioning and find out what we really need to pack and what we don't need. - Charlie said we'd reach the cabin at the end of the first day. so I guess that really means we only have to go fast on day two. - Not exactly. the sooner we get to the cabin, the sooner we can rest and get started again the next day. - This is gonna be a kick. - Don't underestimate it. it's going to be two days of hard work. And eight hours a day won't be easy. - Ahhh, it's gonna be nada. In my new boots, it's gonna be a dynamite time. (soft music) - Hannah said she thought you were here. - When do we move in? - I talked to Mr. Davidson. Well, he almost changed his mind. - It's because of Seth, isn't it? - Word has gotten around about him. - Right. Nobody thinks the birding shop is a good investment. Just what I needed. - Well, a birding and an art shop are a hard sell, And people think giving us a space is a bit risky. - Let's just move in and deal with their opinions later. - Well, maybe Jesse could help. People around here seem to respect him. - That's true. But I'm not asking him. (phone ringing) - Hello? I know. No, I was, I was expecting your call. I've been working on getting you the money, okay? I know. I know Seth left. I'm telling you I don't know where he is. Look, I told you I'm not the answer to your Seth problem. All I'm working on is the money he owes you. (tuning radio) (music playing) - [Radio Evangelist] The county sheriff reports today that illegal gambling rings continue to multiply in our county and the surrounding areas. problems continue to surface as organizations from Detroit, Chicago and cleveland battle to gain power in rural areas. Authorities caution anyone involved in these gambling rings that they are not as innocent as they may seem. Families in the area are being left without hope after heavy losses in high stakes games. Authorities are beginning... - Are you okay, Rose? - Why do you have to care so much? - Because that's what sisters do. - It seems like you're always taking care of me, and it's supposed to be the other way around. - So what? maybe you need it. - No, I can take care of myself! Leave! - Rose! - Get out! (door slams) - Oh, put it over there in the other corner. - Okay. I'll go get the easels. - Okay. - You like it? - I love it. (violin music starts) - So you love it? Is it what you thought it would be? - Can't you say anything? - I know it's gonna be a grandstand in here. We're gonna have a blast. - Come now, can't you see me in here with my new fashions? How about we go get your paintings? (suspenseful music) - I saw Malone back down the road. - Yeah, I saw him too. - Was he following you? - I don't know. You gotta get out of here. - Come on Jesse, what are the chances that-- - I don't know, Wes. - What's he looking for out there? - Just get lost. I'll meet you at my house. - The two of you want some breakfast? - Thanks, Aunt Ella. - Seth is into some bad business. Malone found me near the hangar. - Oh, yeah? what did he have to say? - He was looking for Seth. Wondered if I knew where he was. - You don't have any idea where Seth is so he'll just have to drop it. - I told him that. The man is cock-eyed. Do you have any idea why he'd be at the hangar? - Look, this, the thing is just gonna have to run its course. And hopefully without us. - It was my whole inheritance I got from my father and everything I was sending to Aunt Ella when I was in the war. I never should have given him four bits. - Come on, boys. Get in the kitchen and eat some breakfast. - I always like to sketch out my picture before I start painting it. I should be able to show you some water color techniques tomorrow. - At least my drawings aren't as difficult as birds. - I love your birdhouses. They are very unique. - Are you sure about displaying them at the art gallery opening? - I'm certain. Are you sure you want to sell them to help the gallery? - Oh, for sure. it will be swell. - I love this place. - This is where we break. - You sure we're gonna be able to hike 20 miles? - If we continue working it like we have been, we will. - Maybe that's my disadvantage. I don't see us working it real well. - My new shoes are carrying me. - Well, I'm not quite that optimistic. - That's because you need to stop looking up. You're looking too far ahead. You need to keep your head down and look at your feet and the path right in front of you. - Are you into hiking philosophy now? - It's not philosophical. It's common sense. You're going to be discouraged if you keep looking up at the hill you have to climb. - [Radio Evangelist] It was the love I had for birds as a child that created the love for flying as an adult. I was very young when I heard about the first plane to be designed and flown. I have never stopped having the desire to fly. Flying gives such a different perspective. You see things differently when you're lifted up. I came to know as I would sit and listen to the birds and dream about flying that I was in his secret place, abiding under the shadow of his wing. He wants to lift us up on his wings. He would pour out his presence in my midst so strong I could not hide from his presence. Where I am, he is always there. It's the psalmist who said oh, that I have wings like a dove for then I would fly away and be at rest. Hasn't he given us his wings to ride on? To lift us above? He has made a way for you to mount on the wings of eagles and ride on the wings of the wind. Isn't it time you turn to him for the answers? (changing station) (music playing) - How much longer until it's finished? - I'm not sure. - You are quite the artist. People pay good money for water colors like that. - You're only saying that because you're my brother. - No, seriously. - What are you up to Seth? - What do you mean? - I know you. you're up to something. - Where you going? - To wash out my brushes. (eerie music) - Josie found these hidden in her barn today. I think half of them are missing. - Guys like Seth don't care about who they're hurting. - No, they don't. They lie and cover up with another lie. They take things and use them for what they want. - I love this one. - Here you go. - Can you go to the closet and get me more linen so I can pack this order? - Sure. - Great. You all right? - Yeah. I was just thinking about... Just skip it. - Okay, but you can tell me anything that's bothering you, you know. - Yeah. okay, I will. (tuning radio) - [Radio Evangelist] Never, ever, ever, ever, ever change the word of God to fit your circumstances, but rather let the word of God change your circumstances. The word of God is filled with his promises and reveals his goodness. Believe in his goodness. Psalm 107 says to us, oh, that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonder filled works to the children of men. When I was a child, God's goodness would embrace me. I found the Lord was the anchor of hope for my life. I finally realized it was God that was caring for me from the very moment my mother had abandoned me. He was not the reason for the storm. He was the protector from the storm. It is simple childlike faith and simple understanding to believe in his goodness. There was a day I rescued an abandoned nest and eggs in the midst of a storm. It wasn't me who authored the storm so I could save them. I wasn't to be blamed. Just like the Lord is not to be blamed. The Lord is not the author of the storm. Simply, he is not the giver of bad things. Not at all. It is his goodness that leads us to him. He's not trying to teach a lesson. He is not allowing these things just so that we would love him. He is the one who brings good. He is the one who saves. He is the one who loves. He is the one who blesses. He embraces us with his goodness. Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life. - Looks like you've got enough there to pay me back. - Oh, that and more by the end of the night. If you boys want to join me. - No! See, this is exactly what I've been talking about. It's an endless cycle with you, man. - What do you mean? - I mean give me the dough, Seth. - No. you aren't getting nothing. This here is my cash. - That's Aunt Ella's money and you're not leaving here with it! (police siren blaring) - That's the black and whites, boys. Time to split! - No! you're not ditching me until I get that cash. - All right! how much do I owe you for Aunt Ella? - You know exactly how much! - Hey! (phone ringing) (inaudible voices) - You need to raise your arms over your head if you start feeling out of breath. - Really? - Yep. It opens up your airways and allows more oxygen into your lungs. - You sure you should be giving me advice? I'll be hiking against you in the competition. - I know. I'm just not sure I've been too good of a sister lately. - You've been swell. it's okay. - Not really. I've been thinking about myself a lot lately. - Things are gonna change. I understand. - Hannah, you're so positive... and forgiving. - There's something else bothering you. - I'm just having that same dream again. Fish turning into snakes. Bread turning into stones. - I'd be so angry if I lost my bakery because of someone gambling it away. - Well, I wasn't happy about it, but I'm doing great. - I know if my brother lost my bakery because of a gambling debt, I'd be giving him a knuckle sandwich. - I don't think so, Phoebe. - No fooling. There would be no rupert. I'd flat knock him out. (smashing knuckles) - Okay. hot shot. - Well, girls, I don't serve a gambling God. And it was just a bakery. I know things are going to be restored even better than they were. - I heard Seth left because of a gambling debt. - And I heard Seth took the money from Wes and Wes took the money from you. - Seth and Wes tried to handle some things on their own. It created some tough situations. We'll work everything out. - Too bad there's not a bakery to take this to. - Hey! Why are you so discouraged over my situation? Look, I've got this great kitchen to work in. My baked goods are selling. My catering is in demand. I've got a great business going here. - I agree. - Look, the Lord rebuilds the ruins that men create. Girls, bad things don't come from God. He's just too good. - How's the money looking? - Well, it looks like we have the first three months at least covered. - Good. - But we are still short on the capital needed for the initial stock of the birding items. - I just want people to see this as more than an art gallery and birding shop, you know? I want it to mean something. - I think it's going to be unique. - I've come up with a name. - Really? what is it? - Wings of the wind. (violin music) - I apologize I'm so late, Steven. I'm packing up now. - Oh, it's all right. I just wanted to talk to you about something. - Sure. - I don't like the thought of Josie participating in this competition. - Why is that? She's 15, above the age minimum. She's been conditioning. - She's a goof off and isn't taking this seriously. - It's all for fun anyway so they can see how far they've come. - She hasn't Come far enough. - That's not really fair. She's worked hard. She would be really disappointed. - I need you to disqualify her. - I can't do that. She hasn't done anything wrong. What are you so afraid of, Steven? (laughing) - You see what I mean? I'm not afraid of anything. Winning is what I do best. - Come on, Seth. Can we just go? - We just got here. See? This is chicken hazard. Six is my main so I need a 6 or 12 to make. - Yeah. right. Let's go. - Calm down. Now I don't want to roll aces or 11, all right? And how!? Do you see what I mean? I nicked. Hmm. Give them here. - No. - Just roll them, Steven. - And I suppose you're going to tell me that this is a game of skill. - What are you trying to get my brother involved in? - How did you find me? - I called him before we left. - Oh, nice. That's real Jake, Steve. - Come on. let's go. - Playing brother's keeper now, huh? - Look, you need to see the light, Seth! (laughing) - Oh, see the light? Don't you worry. Me and God are still like this. - I bet. - You know, that was real nice how you ditched us when the flatfoot showed up last night. - What can I say? I'm on the lam. Couldn't stick around. - Right. Well, just go ahead and give me all his money then. - Can't. - What do you mean can't? - You know, you have winning streaks and losing streaks. - There is no way that you lost all of that money in a day. - I told you there was a game at Malone's at midnight. - I've missed these times together. - I've missed them, too. - We just need to hang out more. - Yeah. It would be good for you to be around friends. Say, bitterness, blame and anger aren't going to help you feel better. - I'm finally having some fun in my life, making a difference in learning how to make a living, a good living. And you want to spoil it all with this don't gamble nonsense? I'm not hurting anyone! - Nonsense? are you kidding? This isn't about gambling nonsense. This is about how you're hurting people. How you're hurting yourself. - No, this intervention, this intervention is nonsense. - This isn't a fulfilling life. - Only because all of you are ruining it for me. - Do you really think that you're going to make a living out of gambling? - Yes, I do! I'm a professional gambler. - Wow. a real vision for your future. A real vision that takes from everybody else. But that's what you do, isn't it, Seth? Take from everyone else. A real moocher. - No, that's not fair. This has just been my friends helping me while I've learned a profession. - You've got to be kidding me. Surely you're not that stupid. - You're just angry at mom leaving and dad not letting you fly! - I am not the one yelling here. - I am only yelling because you're so stubborn. - And why is it that everyone else is always your problem, Seth?! You're always blaming someone else! - Wow. Wow. And what your guys problem, huh? There you go again hanging me out to dry. - That's enough, Seth! Get a grip, all right? You are so selfish, man, it is ridiculous. You are not the victim here. - Everybody's got a kick a guy when he's down. You all talk about making choices, huh? Well, I'm making mine. I'm leaving, Rose. I'll work on paying everyone back as I get on my feet with my next winnings. (sobbing) - Just like mom! Making your choices, huh? - Tell dad I said goodbye. Thanks for nothing, guys. (sobbing) (airplane whirs by) (phone rings) - Here you go. - Cornell aircraft. Yes. Why? I don't know. Okay. I said okay. I'll see you then. - Hey, Jesse. Brought you some strawberries. - Well, thanks, Sam. - Going to birding fest today? - I don't think so. - Why not? do you have to work again? (knocking at door) - You think you could take Sam upstairs? Just help her get ready to go birding with Rose? - What's happening? - Nothing I can't take care of. - Are you back to stay? - You know I'm not. - There's no money to be had here, so you can just leave? - I just need in the house. - There's not a chance. - Come on, Jesse. just let me in. You're my cousin. I need some help here. - You have stolen from our family. You've lied and cheated all of us. And now you're going to play the victim? You got a lot of nerve. - Just let me in. - Have you lost it, huh? Ella and Sam are in there. - I just need to get something. - Don't give me that lie, okay? This is my house. You need to change. We don't need the hurt that you're causing everyone. - Shut up, Jesse. I don't need your sermon. (scuffling) - Okay, everyone. Make sure your shoes are tied and you have everything you need. Okay, so class, we're going to take a little one mile hike down the trail. Along the way we should see some beautiful birds, and I'll point them out as we go along. - And we need to stay on the path and not get off. Hiking rule number one is to always keep yourself seen. - Miss Rose! I brought a friend with me. his name is Winsley. - How are you, Winsley? I'm glad you came. - Fine. me too! - Are you ready to go birding? - Yes. I love birds. - He had a nest in his room, and the mother would come through his window to feed her babies. - You're not afraid of thunder storms, are you? - Oh, no. I know God is with me. - Okay, that's what I figured. okay. let's go! - I am not chickening out! - Are too! - Am not! - You just need to cool down! - Hey, Dolly, I'm going to need you to back off and do that right now. - Quit flapping your lips at me. keep right on walking. - Quit flapping your lips at me. - I heard that! - I heard that! - I heard that, too. - I'm not crossing. - It's like four inches deep. - How do you know? - Because I just crossed it. - Would you two hang up the fighting?! How are we going to win with you both acting like a couple of knuckleheads? (indiscriminate chatter) - You need to keep these shoes tied, Peanut. - Shh. Everyone, you hear that? It's a cardinal. - I don't see him. - There he is right over there. - Over there? - Can Sam and I go up ahead and look? - Yes, but you two watch out. - I'll be right here. Stay close by, and stay seen. - Okay. we'll be right back. - I still hear him. I think we're going to find him. - Keep watching, Winsley. We'll find him. - I will because I love cardinals. (birds chirping) - Rose has seemed pretty upset lately. What do you think is wrong? - She just needs to consider the sparrow. You know, how they don't toil or plant, but the Lord takes care of them. - That's rich. - Isn't it the Lord that maketh the rich? That's what the Bible says. - Clever. - I just figured the Lord says what he means. - I guess believing is a choice we act on, right? - Yep, just choose to believe. - So how far are we going? - Where are we anyway? - Yeah. where are we? - Do you see it yet? - Are we getting too far? - My shoe is untied again. - Does God kill a bird, miss Rose? - Of course not. why would he do that? - My friends told me that God does bad things to teach us a lesson. - God says he knows when every bird falls to the ground. - Why do people think that all the bad things that happen are God trying to get our attention? I don't think that I would let something bad happen to you up here on this hike just to teach you guys to listen to me. How crummy is that? - That's true. How dumb would that be? - No, if something bad were to happen, it would be because you didn't listen to me. - We'll listen. - Should we turn around? (branch snapping) - What was that? - The bird. - I don't think so. Ivy, I don't think you should do that. Seth? - What are you doing? - Shhh. - Rose is going to be furious. - Now, don't you girls go telling Rose you saw me. You'll only upset here. - She's already upset. - All the more reason. You don't want to upset her more, do you? - What are you doing? - You're bloody, and this is pretty creepy. - Look, I know how it looks, but I, I ran into something and I'm looking for something I dropped. - Out here? - Go on back to Rose now. - Girls, do not tell Rose. (ominous music) (phone rings) (slams phone down) (crickets chirping) - Did you hear that loud noise? - Outside? - No. in the house. In the living room. - It's probably just dad. - No, dad's not home yet. Plus he would have just turned on the light. - You coming? - Where? - To find out what the noise was. Hannah, come on! (phone rings) (slams phone down) (phone rings) (slams phone down) - Are you sure you heard something? - Yes, I'm sure. (thud) - What are we doing? What's that for? - Let's go. (ominous music) - Did you hear something? - All I hear is my heartbeat. - You need to toughen up. - Maybe we should have stayed inside. (footsteps running by) - I heard that! - Shh! (suspicious creaking) (eerie music) (scuffle) - Ahh! Ah. (moaning) - It's time to pay up. - Look, I've been saving up but I don't have the whole 7,000 Seth owes. - Well, we'll consider this interest. And we'll consider this a deposit. - That plane doesn't belong to us. - And that's not my problem. No money, and I'll take the plane. - I'm keeping my focus. God is protecting us. The Lord is my shepherd. - Hannah, you need to go beyond the children's tall tales. - If you aren't believing, what are you doing? - Going to sleep. (hanger door opens) - Hey, boys. Didn't bet on you being here. - I guess you lost again. - I'm going to need to borrow a bird. - After all you've done, now you're going to steal a plane. - You just missed Malone. He beat the daylights out of me and took the keys to the plane. - Oh, man. That's tough. I, I'm real sorry about that. - He made it pretty clear you left me holding the bag. - I mean, you're family. You're supposed to help. Do you know what they'll do to me? - You need to make this right. - Look, I'm sorry about Aunt Ella. I wish there was something I could do. - This isn't just about Aunt Ella anymore, okay? This is about everyone! I mean, things are sideways here, and you're out there chasing shadows. - Look, if I could make this right-- - Well, let's go see Uncle Cliff and Rose then. We'll work together and come up with the money. We'll get you out of this, and you can come back home. Are you going to answer me? Seth! - No. it's obvious none of you want to help me. - Because we won't loan you any more money or let you take a plane? - Yes, that's what I need. Look, I'm skipping town, and I'm not coming back this time. And that's on you, boys. (ominous music) (birds chirping) - Wake up. Rose! Are you okay? - Swell. - The dream again? (birds chirping) (key clacks in birdhouse) - What's that? - It's a box I found in the linen closet. - Oh. - What's stranger is that I found a key to it out in the birdhouse. - That is strange. - What's in it? - This is my mother's jewelry. - How could you? - How could I what? - This! - Look, I didn't take anything. - It was in your house! - That doesn't mean I took it. don't you think that if I took it, I would have already lost it all to a debt? I didn't tell you this, but Seth has been showing up looking for cash. He was trying to get in the house. Now I know why. - Seth is back? - No, he just kept coming back trying to get money. But I don't think we'll see him again. - How do I know you're not messed up with Seth? I keep seeing you around with a shovel. - That's just something Wes and I are taking care of. - You want me to buy into this? - No, we're family. And I'm going to take care of it. - Jesse? I'm going to choose to believe you. (sad violin music) (plane whirs by) - I told Jesse that I think it's time that we leveled with the two of you. - I tried to handle this on my own, okay? But when Wes got involved, it all turned bad. I know you know Seth has a gambling debt with Malone. - Well, it's a lot worse than you think. - How much is he in for? - 7,000. I, I got a stash of money buried. - But it's not enough. We're still $5,000 shy, and Malone made it pretty clear that we don't have much time left. - So Uncle Cliff, he's got the key to the Cessna. - And he's going to keep coming back until we finish this. - It's ridiculous we have to pay off Seth's debt. - I'll come up with something. - Let's dig up the money before they wise up to where it is. (soft music) - No! - Stop telling me no. - I think the two of you need to calm down. - I don't want to calm down. Nobody's listening to me. - You're right about that. - I know I'm right and you don't need to be doing this competition. - Look, everything is going to be fine. - Would you stop saying that? Everyone just thinks I'm over reacting. - I know you are! - What will it take to get you to listen? Hide your hiking boots? What? You're going to have to choose, Josie. It's all about people making the right choices, isn't it? I'll be there to pick up the pieces when this thing falls apart. - Steven, don't leave. - It's settled. (piano music on radio) (ominous music) (panting) (Seth's muffled voice) (bird chirping) - [Radio Evangelist] Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers. The snare is broken, and we are escaped, Psalm 124:7. I'll say the scripture again to help you understand what the word of God is telling you. Our soul is escaped is a bird out of the snare of the fowler. Our snare is broken, and we are escaped. Psalm 124:7: The Lord is not caging us with problems or circumstances. He is not doing things to teach us a lesson or get our attention. He is good God. He is not the author of evil. He has sent his son Jesus and set us free from the snare of the fowler. He wants us to believe in his love for us, to embrace His word and receive his blessing. If you would step out in all your reasoning and all your emotion and know his thoughts are higher than yours, then you would fly. You would rise above the challenges, the people and the circumstances that are contrary to who he is, and he would give you wings to ride upon the wind. - You are team five, the last team to leave. you kick off in 30 seconds. - You'll see on your map the trails split into two. The left trail is the easy trail. it is a big longer but much easier. The trail is clearly laid out, and it's difficult to get lost. The right trail is the advanced trail. While it's shorter, it's much more difficult. - We'll be here waiting for you tomorrow afternoon. Happy hiking! (girls giggle) - Josie? Take the easy trail. - Yeah. yeah. you're holding me up. Hurry, girls. - Pace yourself! - Why are we doing this again? - Because we're part of the hiking club. - And why are we part of a hiking club again? - Because these are our friends. - And why are these -- - Okay already. Quit your complaining. - Yeah, let's have a good time. - This area is so amazing. I think I can spot some nice birds here. (soft music) (birds chirping) - Let's get moving. - Slow down. You're going too fast. - Remember what Charlie said? Pace yourself. - Don't be a stick in the mud, Hannah. - This is going to be a long 20 miles. - Where do you think Josie is now? - If they're going at a steady pace like they should be, they'll be around here. - And the trail splits here. - Right. But they shouldn't reach that for another 15 minutes or so. - Say, Charlie, do you have anymore maps? Thanks. I'm heading out on the trail. - Here. At least take my compass. - Thanks. - Can I come? - No. - We are way ahead of pace by almost 20 minutes. - Isn't that good? - Not exactly. We can't use up energy early on. - Well, let's take the easy trail and slow down. We should be closer to Rose's group anyway. - Come on, you fuddy duddies! - What are you doing? - Get back here! - It's no sweat. Look how far ahead we are. - That's because we're going too fast. - Think how far ahead we'll get if we take this trail. - Come back, Josie. - Come on, Josie. - Don't be a fathead. - We can't let her go alone. - Psst! Hey, what's she doing? - What do you see? - A red crossbill. I've never seen one before. - There it is. Very rare. Must be a bust year up north for them to be this far south. - Well, I'm lost with all that. And you're pointing isn't helping me to see it. - Put it this way. It inspires me to paint. - Get on, girl. (soft music) - She's all fueled up and ready to fly. - Thanks, Jesse. - Yeah. - I've come up with a way to pay off some of Seth's debt. When I deliver this plane, the two of you go to the address on the paperwork there, and you close the deal. - What are you saying? - I'm selling my plane. - But-- - It's already done. - I'm beginning to realize how dumb this was. We should never have followed you. - What are you talking about? - Probably the three of us taking the advanced trail of a 20 mile hike without an adult. - That's it, all right. We should have brought Steven with us. - This was so dumb. - Steven isn't an adult. He's just my brother. - He's older than us. - By only four years. - That makes him like 20. - So what? - So what? so what?! - Yeah. so what? - You are such a meathead. - Stop fighting! It's not making anything better, and we need to find the cabin before dark. - Do you care if we take the easy trail? - Like I would care. - Good because I told Hannah I'd stay on the same trail as her team just in case they needed some help. - Sounds like a good idea. - Okay then. (soft, cheery music) - A blue grosbeak. Lunch? - I'll be back. I want to take some time to sketch. (soft music) - [Radio Evangelist] It is the Lord who cuts rivers among rocks, whose eye sees every precious thing. It is he who brought water out of a rock in the wilderness and gave drink as out of great depths. He is the bread of life who has exchanged himself for the stony places of our lives. The word tells us that Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness to turn stones into bread. Even Satan knew that it is Jesus who turns stones into bread. So many think that Jesus, the living bread, is the author of stony places in life. No. Satan is the author of the stony places. Jesus said in luke chapter 11 verse 11, if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent? No. He gives us his goodness. He is the bread of life and has shed his blood for each of us on the stony place of the cross. However, he has risen. All the stones were rolled away. He is the life giver, the author of the blessing, the son of righteousness, and has risen with healing in his wings. (sobs) - It's going to be easier for us to just sit here and wait for someone to find us. - I don't see how you forgot to bring the compass. The one thing we actually need, and you forgot it. - We should have remembered the compass. - She probably couldn't read it anyway. - I just never imagined that Steven would be right. He frustrates me, and I didn't want to listen. - Now we know you should have. (soft, joyful music) - Rise and shine, girls. Time to get up. Apology accepted. Now let's go home. But there will be payback. - I ought to smack you into next month, leaving without a compass. then you take the advanced trail. You know better. - I don't know what I was thinking. - Can't tell me the Lord didn't put you in check. He's always speaking. - The Lord? - Yes, the Lord. (chuckles) The Lord is always speaking. Some listen. Some don't listen. And some refuse to listen. Weren't you listening? - I guess not. (soft violin music) - We gotta get out of here in 30 minutes. - All right. - I'm just disappointed. - It's okay. Giving up the shop is what I need to do to help Jesse. I'm not a quitter. I'll buy more supplies and we'll start again. - You're right. we will. And I'm sticking with you. - Best friends forever? - Best friends forever. - Okay then. (family happily Chatters) - It is amazing how it all added up. We had all the money in a box and put it on the table right in front of him and told him just don't snap your cap at us anymore. - We did it. - Well, we canceled the debt Seth couldn't pay. - They're probably going to get caught soon by the black and whites. I know they've been working those raids for a couple years. - What's this? - The papers to our new plane. When I went to deliver the plane to Kendall manufacturing, john Kendall gave it to me. - Just like that? - Just like that. Well, go get ready. You're going to fly today. (jazz music) (soft, triumphant music) - [Radio Evangelist] Isaiah 40 verse 31 tells us that they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint. If you begin to understand the motion of the wind and the simple aerodynamics of how a plane or a bird flies, you will understand the miracle of lift and God's plan for your life. The word of God tells us that we will ascend, spring up, rise, be taken up and exalted as we understand the term "they shall mount up with wings of eagles". Putting the law of lift into operation supercedes the natural law of gravity. The power of faith is a spiritual force. - Rose, I'm enjoying your water colors in my gallery. Your inspiration has touched me. I was praying and felt I was to give you this. I believe it is more than enough for you to open your wings of the wind shop and hope you keep it going for a while. May you be blessed as you embrace the Lord's goodness. John Kendall. - [Radio Evangelist] There is no speech nor language where the voice of his word is not heard. It has come forth from the end of heaven and make its circuits unto the ends of Earth. The heavens declare his glory. The line of his word has gone throughout and has set a tabernacle for the son as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber. Day unto day utters speech. Night unto night shows his handiwork. The law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure. Making wise the simple, his word establishes the heart. His word is forever.
