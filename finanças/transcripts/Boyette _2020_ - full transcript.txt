--== McEphie ==-- [music playing] # Let's go, c'mon Don't stop it # # Let's go, c'mon Let's make this worth it # # Let's go, c'mon Don't stop it # [woman] Lights! Ready? [woman] Get in formation! Double-time! [music playing] [man] One, two, three, four... Five, six, seven, eight... Eight, seven, six, five... Four, three, two, one... Power! Energy! This may seem like a Miss Universe Finals Night. But it's not! This is just a rehearsal for the Graduation Ball of Morong National High School Batch 2019. That's me! The pretty one in the middle! The one in yellow! That's me! This is me speaking because this is my movie! Isn't our rehearsal amazing? Costumes galore! The theme of the dance number is '80s, because that's what the director wanted. Do you believe in the saying "follow your heart"? I just asked because I personally believe that. For example, I love dancing even if I'm not allowed to dance... because of my asthma. -[beeping] -[wheezing, panting] [panting] [clatters] I'm about to pass out but I still haven't introduced myself. -[groans] -[crowd gasps, screams] [man] It's your girl... Boyet! It's not Boyet! It's Boyette. Not a girl yet! [dings] [groans] [music playing] Doc Thor, my son's asthma attacks are getting frequent. Why? We'll find out from Boyet's X-ray results. [Boyet] Today is a very beautiful day to meet my family! [screams] [Boyet] That's Baduding. Our overacting maid. She's hardworking but always exaggerating. Like this for example. My god! What's this, Doc?! You're exaggerating! Look at this! The results almost fell. [grumbling] [Boyet] That's my older brother Bitoy. He has a dad bod but he's not a dad yet. He manages our computer shop. And yes, he is also exaggerated. What's the matter with you? Give me that! This family is always exaggerating! [gasps, screams] [Boyet] Again, with the overacting. And that is Brett. He's the youngest but acts like the eldest. Stop that! Take acting workshops if you want to act! So exaggerated! [Boyet] And that is my beloved Papa Boy! He's the most exaggerated in the family. You'd think he saw something shocking! Wait! Papa, is it really shocking? Doc! Doc! Is he really pregnant? [Doc Thor] Pregnant? No! [Boyet] Doc Thor is just an extra. Let's freeze the screen for fun. [chuckles] Okay, play. No! Oh! Wrong film! This is my wife's ultrasound. -[Baduding] You have a wife? -A wife? This is Boyet's X-ray result. But what does this mean, Doc? This means that Boyet's lungs weren't fully developed. Because of his intrinsic asthma at the age of seven. [Doc Thor] This is your fault. You sheltered Boyet. In some cases, asthma can be deadly. -[gasps] Boyet. -Ouch. -But as long as Boyet... -Love, don't take Boyet please. can stay healthy and active... But don't worry. We still have other children. Get them. Take them first. Boyet will be very good. Huh? [Doc Thor] In fact, he'll reach a lot of milestones in his life. Soon, you'll be in college. Happy graduation! Honey, go ahead. I'll just drop by at the Camacho's to get food because they have plenty! -He has an alter account? -Certainly! She's not that pretty. True. Congrats! The graduation ceremony's done, why are you still bowing? It's so heavy. Look at my neck full of medals! Sorry! Congrats! We'll help you. One, two, three! Up. What the hell? Ouch! Let's just take a picture! -You're hurting him. -I will take the picture. -Okay, game? -Ready, guys? Closer! [camera shutter clicks] -Perfect! -Okay! Congratulations-- -What the heck? -Sorry! Brett, remove the medals. Why me? -Remove them. -Wait. Don't strangle him. [screams] -He slipped. -Oh no. My medals! -Wait, it's too heavy! -Slowly. By the way, don't forget... You will enroll at Malaya University so you can be a Manila girl! Yes! Yes! I'm excited! I wish it's enrollment already tomorrow. Nice! So, what course are you taking? What else? Of course, something with dance-- IT! -He can only do IT! -Yes, sir. I'm sure you won't get asthma attacks... if you'll just sit all day in front of a computer! And, son, you'll inherit this internet shop. Wow! You're an heir of an internet shop. Heir to the wires, cables and smelly headphones! [Boyet] That's it? Just Boyet's internet shop in the future? I can't imagine myself watching over kids playing Minecraft and ladies chatting with foreigners! I don't want to take IT! I don't! -I don't want! I don't! -Calm down! -[grunts] -[groans] -Girl! -What did you do? You made him into a cartoon! Okay, fine. Ouch! He's an anime now! Fix this! As I was saying, that's not my dream! That's his dream for me! Ever since I had asthma, I was forbidden to do the things I want to do! Well, if you have a say in all of this, what would that be? [exhales] Is there a Bachelor of Performing Arts Major in Dance at Malaya University? That's what I want! My mom told me that I'd be a dancer like her. And I'll get to travel to different parts of the world. U.S., Dubai, -Egypt. -But girl... That's your mom's dream. -Is that what you want too? -Of course! Do you think this is just a joke? [Boyet] Come on! How do I make my dad agree to what I want? He forbid my mom from dancing before. And now it's me. You know that we're always here to support and understand you, right? But this is different. He's your dad! You and your family are the only ones who can make him say yes. Just remember we're always here for you, okay? Always. Thank you. You're welcome. Anyway, we have to go. It's getting late. You just said that you're here for me. -Leave! -Ouch! -Enough! -[door opens] [Pia] These spring rolls are not enough. [Kylie] And their spaghetti is already spoiled! [door closes] [Boyet] Ma... Please help me. How do I make Dad agree to what I want? To what we want? [soft piano music playing] [exhales] What? What... what happened? Why do I look like this? This is my haircut when I was 5 years old. Bro... Oh! I didn't have asthma yet! 2007? So, this is a flashback? Oh, okay. [woman] Son, where are you? We're going to dance. There you are. [dance music playing] Ma? Let's dance, my son. Ma! I've missed you! Wait! Let's dance! Dance with me. Don't be shy. Come on. Like this. My son is an amazing dancer! You're just like me! As long as you follow your heart, you'll never miss a step. You'll achieve everything you want in life, my child. Who knows? You might be the one to achieve my dreams of being a dancer in Japan. Best friend! -Charles? -Join us! Best friend, join us! [chuckling] Hold on! Why are you dancing? Why didn't you invite me?! No fair! Hon, join us! Let's dance! Come on! Hon, wait a minute-- You missed me, don't you? Just like before! I have something to tell you, best friend. We're moving to Manila. But I promise you, if we see each other there, we'll still dance like this. -You promise? -Yes! [coughing] -What happened to you? -Water! -Ma! -Water! Water! -Faster. I need water. -Ma! -Water! Water! -Go! Ma! Ma, are you okay? [Boyet] This flashback is my chance to ask Mama for advice. As the saying goes, "Mother knows best." Ma? How did you tame Dad? What? He's as scary as a tiger. Any animal, even a tiger, are nice to the ones who feed them. [panting] [Boyet] They're nice to the ones who feed them. Cock-a-doodle-gay! Cock-a-doodle-gay, huh! Come here! Come here! Come here! [screaming] Surrender now! I have your siblings! Fight me! Finally! [Boyet mimics chicken clucking] [yawning] Oh! You're all here! Come on! Let's eat! Isn't it a beautiful day? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?! Come on, Camacho family. Let's eat! [Boyet] I prepared lots of delicious dishes. Amazing! Roasted chicken! Chicken stew. Chicken adobo. Tamarind soup with chicken. Fried chicken. Which cockpit did you come from? [sobbing] Damn you, Boyette. You said they are just chickens. Of course, I want Dad to eat his favorite food before going to work. Papa, dig in! Pa... I already thought about the course I want to take in college. What's there to think of? I already told you what to take. You're taking up IT! IT! I wanted to take... Bachelor of Performing Arts Major in Dance. [utensils clank] [clears throat] [clears throat] Let's eat. Let's eat. You know it's my dream to dance, and I love dancing- But you have asthma! But the doctor said that as long as I stay active-- Enough! We already talked about this! And your brother already took care of your tuition. Let's eat. Baduding, can I have some fish sauce? [clears throat] I slept really well. I didn't wake up to the crowing of the gamecocks. The chicken is good. It's like it was well taken care of. [sobbing] [Boy] What happened to you? Let's eat! No, thank you. I'll just rest in my room. Boyet made me catch Boy's chickens so he can cook. What?! These are my gamecocks? Boyette! What have you done?! I'm one week away from making these cocks talk! I enrolled them in English class! They're with me every night! They will make me win! What did you do to them? Pa! Don't! [Boyet] No!!! [upbeat music playing] -Good morning, ma'am! -Good morning, ma'am! Where are you? Come on. Where? What's the color of your shirt? Ma... I lost to Dad. I ended up taking IT. Don't worry, Ma! I bet I'll enjoy this. It's just four years after all! And Destiny's Child taught me to be a survivor! I'm not gon' stop! I'm gonna work harder! -Girl! -Girl! Welcome to college life! Thank you! -Let's do a campus tour? -Boyette! Wait! Are you going to cut classes? -Campus tour. -Yeah. That's the same! I'll let Papa know about this. Is that so? I won't give you your allowance then. You'll go hungry. I was joking! Where's your sense of humor? I actually wanted to accompany you. Okay then! [Boyet] Here we go. I'm so excited! College life is going to be fun! What the... Okay, class... For this course, you'll learn the basics of IT. But just because it's basic, doesn't mean you won't pay attention. [scoffs] This is so boring! Programming techniques... [in distorted voice] and system development. I'll just do a Toktik. [professor] We will have an introduction to software. We'll talk about the software used by IT professionals. This will not be basic IT without programming techniques and system development. How will you be legit IT students if you don't know basic programming, right? [clears throat] [professor] It's easy to pass my class. Psst! Psst! What did I miss? -Just complete your attendance. -Introduction to Basic IT. -And pass my requirements. -I already know that. This is my second take. -We won't have any problem. -I'm Nancy. -Boyet. -Boyet. Camacho. Macho, huh? [chuckles] -Any questions? -You're cute. Bye. See you! Hey! Where are you going? You just got here. I have an event. Shhh. I'm leaving. Stay there! Shut up or I'll kiss you! No? You sure you don't want a kiss? You want it! I know. Just go then! Ok. Bye! # Yow! # # How are you my friend? I'm happy to talk to you again # # You're in my mind... # [Kylie] Boyette, this is what I was telling you. This is where we join university organizations. [Catriona] In fairness there's no crowd yet! I didn't know that there's a rapper club here. They're not rappers. What are they then? Gift wrappers! Gift-wrapping Club. -What a lame joke! -[laughing] So, Boyette... Which org are you joining? Let me just check my options. [Nancy] Let's show some moves so other people will join. Is the music ready? Okay, game? Let's dance! Game! [dance music playing] One more time. [dance music continues] [dance music continues] Hey! You! Dance! -Join us! -Let's dance. -Dance with us! -Come on! -Dance! Dance! Dance! -[cheering] -Let's go. -Dance! -Dance. -Hey! -Come dance with us! Come on! -Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! -Dance! -Let's go. Dance! Dance! Dance! Go! Dance! Go! [ethnic music playing] What's that? -[crowd laughing] -[ethnic music continues] You'll be in trouble if your dad sees this! [music stops] It's fine! Don't stress about it! It's still a dance. Join us so you can learn modern dance too. Sorry. I stopped dancing years ago. [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music swells] Charles?! Boyet?! -Best friend! -Best friend! How have you been? -Been great! You? -Long time! I never really got to visit again since we left Bataan. Don't worry! You're still my best friend! Guys, guys! This is my childhood friend, Boyet Camacho. He's a macho man! Tough! Rock-solid. And most of all, he's a great dancer! So, you're joining the team, right? I'll take care of you. They listen to me. What do you think? I can't. Excuse me, I have to do something. Hey! [panting] Hey! Boyet! Charles? Auditions are open tomorrow. You should come. I can't. [panting] What do you mean you can't? Don't you want to dance together again? Hey! [panting] [inhaling] What's wrong? [Charles] Stand up! Did it hurt? It's... it's not my first time. [Charles] Oh, that's why you're good at sucking. [panting] Hey! Come back here! You can't or your dad doesn't allow you? [Charles scoffs] Your mom used to be a dancer, right? She always tells us to just dance and... follow your heart. You should follow her. Charles... -My mom's in heaven now. -[boings] So, you know, it's hard to follow her there. I still have a lot of dreams. I'm still young. Sorry. I didn't know. [exhales] You know, best friend, don't think about your asthma too much. My brother, who's a doctor, said that you have to overcome your sickness. I promise! And that's what they teach us too. I'm a Sports Science major. I'll take care of you. There's an upcoming Annual Manila Inter-U Dance Competition. What's that? Dance competition for all universities in Manila. We're this year's host. If we win, we'll compete in Japan. [dings] [in high-pitched voice] Japan? [in high-pitched voice] Japan! That was high! Yes, best friend! Japan! Yes! High-pitched because it's exciting! I'm happy we saw each other again, best friend. See you at the auditions tomorrow! Yes! Promise! I'll audition! I'll wait for you. [upbeat music playing] Hi! Are you going to audition? Yes! Alright! Here. Just fill out this form. Here's the pen, this way. Thank you. [indistinct chatter] [Nancy] She's good. Wow! [Sir Cei] You didn't pass but I'll treat you some lunch. [applause] -That's impressive. -[chuckles] [Sir Cei] That's a new dance step! Jabbawockeez haven't danced that yet. [buzzing] [Sir Cei] It really hurts to watch you. [buzzing] [Charles] I like the outfit. Disgusting! [Sir Cei] We should wipe the floor after! Stop! Stop! -You're accepted, stop dancing! -[applause] [Sir Cei] You may start. Good luck! Good afternoon! I am Boyet Camacho. BS IT. Freshman. Okay! You may start now! And Boyet, good luck! God bless you! Break a leg! I'm rooting for you and-- Hey! Calm down! Are you the mother? [chuckles] Sorry. Go Boyet! ["'Di Ko Akalain" by Demo Boys playing] Wow! Slaying! [Nancy] I need to take a video of this. Isn't he good? -Impressive! -We'll see. [Nancy] Move it, Boyet! Oh my gosh, It's a yes for me. What's happening? Stop! Stop! Stop! Okay! Thank you, Camacho! Thank you! Nice one, best friend! Go, Boyet! It's fine! You're fine! Thank you! Why did you audition?! I'm scared for you. Girl, you have asthma! What? Me? I have asthma? You didn't know? I'm just joking! I know! That's why I'm going to show Papa that I can do it. There! He'll show us! Whatever. I have class. I'll go ahead. Take care. I hope you trip. Boyet! Best friend! Hey! Best friend! Nice! -You and Kylie got in! -Really? Yeah! How? But I screwed up. I didn't finish my dance. You were great! And what did I tell you? I'm their idol. Whatever I say, they agree. And I told them that I like you. [hopeful music playing] What? You like me? Of course, I like you to be our member. -[music stops] -[chuckles] Yes, best friend! You're right! Thank you! I'm so happy! Hey! Faggot! You were saying? Sorry. Nothing. Forget it! Charles... Do you have a problem with... gay people? None. I just don't want to be friends with one. [glass shatters] Why? Are you gay? What? [hesitates] Of course not! [scoffs] -Best friend, I'm a manly man! -[squeaks] -Yeah? Really? -Ouch! Yeah! Manly man, best friend. Anyway, I'll go ahead! -I'll see you at rehearsal. -Okay. [Pia] "Faggot"? I'll kick him in the balls! He's really a troubled child. I saw him at the school gate one time... pushing his mom away. Go figure. He's a homophobe. You're a judger, you know that? That doesn't make him a homophobe. It does! A person who hates homosexuals and treats them badly... is a homophobe. Charles is a homophobe! [Pia] My gosh! He's cancelled! My god! If I were you, I'd tell him the truth. If he doesn't accept you, then fine. But if he does, go! But if Boyette admits that he's gay, he'll lose his best friend. And he might get cut from the dance group. He'll say goodbye to his dreams of dancing and visiting Japan. [Catriona] What are you going to do with Charles? There must be another way. [in manly voice] Shut up! Girl, you're crazy! I'm crazy?! Can't you act normal? A normal guy. Isn't this enough? Not manly enough? You're fine. Very good. Not good! What if your dad finds out that you're going against his wishes? Right! He doesn't need to know! Ouch! Think about it, Boyette! Ouch! I'm not Boyette anymore! Who are you then? [action music playing] Boyet Ca...macho. [Pia] Oh, really? What a revelation! -[shrieks] -[dings, boings] -Girl! Will I pass as an actor? -[excited chatter] [Bitoy] I missed the both of you. It's been very quiet here at home. How's school? School is fine. It's just a little stressful. It's like a different world. You don't know where you really belong. You don't know if the people around you like you. But it's fine. A little tiring, but fun! I can handle it. You know me. Wait! What? Are you doing something you shouldn't be doing? [Boy] Why is it tiring? [phone chimes] Why aren't you answering? I WON'T TELL ON YOU IF YOU GIVE ME YOUR ALLOWANCE. Why can't you answer me? Answer me! Of course not, Pa. I'm a good girl at school. Let me massage you. Brett? Yes? Tell me the truth. None! You're being paranoid. He's not dancing? Not yet. What do you mean not yet? I meant "No, want to bet?" You misheard me. Boyette, I'm happy you're behaving in school. Of course! Told you I'm a good girl! Why are you choking me? Please welcome, our new members! [cheering] I'm so happy! Welcome to the club! Thank you! But why do you look more excited? I was the one who got in. Are you happy? We will do our best! Always remember our motto: Follow the right steps and you'll be on stage! [cheering] Okay, everybody... The elevator's not working again, guys! [professor] I want you to group yourselves and launch a simple program using all the codes-- Boyet! Be my partner! Please? -Okay, fine! -Okay! Sir! Boyet's mine! [cheering] Hey, stop! It's not like that! We hope your relationship will last forever! Are you getting married? When's the christening? [Nancy] You guys are dirty-minded! [keyboard clacking] I thought you were busy with the assignment! What are you doing on Facegram? Am I not allowed to post a status update? Let me post this. I'm almost done. I knew this would happen. There! Posted! Let's see if somebody likes my post! Oh! There's one already! Nancy! Yeah? Your top has a hole! Oh my gosh, really? I'll take care of it! I'll sew it up! [Nancy] Oh, my god! You really have a sewing kit? And you know how to sew? Where did you learn to sew? When my mom stopped dancing, she became a tailor. I learned how to sew from her. [giggling] Your finger! It's tickling my armpit! [giggling] -[grunts] -[squeaks] Ouch! Why did you poke me? You haven't asked me out, yet you're poking me? -[boings] -[chuckling] Why? I won't be able to finish sewing this. Why not? The hole is too big. Oh my gosh! Oh no! Ask your mom to fix it. That's why I was feeling cold. So annoying. Anyway... Oh, my god! It worked! You're amazing, Boyet! You're so awesome, Boyet! Our plans finally pushed through! What are we doing here? Isn't it too early for a pool party? Pool party? We're training today. This is the best way to strengthen your lungs. Swimming! How will you dance if you always get asthma attacks? Charles, I don't know how to swim! I might drown! I don't like! I don't! I don't! [Boyet, in high-pitched voice] I don't?! # I suddenly go boom boom # # My heart goes vroom vroom # # My eyes go zoom zoom # # Every time I see you # # Boom boom # # My heart goes vroom vroom # # My eyes go zoom zoom # # Every time I see you # Sorry. I haven't trimmed yet. This was too sudden! Me too! # My eyes go zoom zoom # # Every time I see you # Matchy-matchy! # I hope you get it I hope you get it # # You get it? # # You are the reason To the smile on my lips # One more round! Wait, please! Swim! # Your smile's my vitamin # # You make me sing lalalala # Best friend! Hey! [Boyet] This is my life now! I study hard... But I still make time for dancing! And of course, I'm always with my best friend... Charles. [giggles] # Boom boom # # My heart goes vroom vroom # # My eyes go zoom zoom # # Every time I see you # # Boom boom # # My heart goes vroom vroom # # My eyes go zoom zoom # Every time I see you # # I never thought That I'd fall for you # Let's go!

I don't have proof but I promise, it's true! Stop spreading fake news! You're not a troll! Propaganda! Isn't that Charles and his mom? Act natural. [Charles] We have nothing to talk about. Let me go! [Catriona] What did I tell you? He pushes his mom away. You're right. He looks really angry at his mother. I wonder why. [in lowered voice] Act natural. [sobbing] [squeaking] Uncle Alfred? Girl, that's his dad! His dad's gay? [gasps] Girl, close your mouth! Close your mouth, you might swallow all of us. Sorry. Is that the reason why he's a homophobe? Possible! But why would he treat his father that way? Shut up! You're the same. You're lying to your father! Stop it, both of you! You'll be late. Let's go! If your dad finds out, Boyette, you'll be in big trouble! -Hey! -Sir! I'll just visit my sons. They're not answering my messages. I'll just look for them. Sure, sir. [growls] Pia, give Boyette a break. Come on! Let's just support him! And he's old enough to make his own decisions. And he usually listens to us especially when he knows he's going overboard. Fine, madame Catriona. I promise. -[boings] -Hey. Sir? Is this the College of Arts building? Girl! Girl! Girl! Are you seeing what I'm seeing? It's Uncle Boy! What is he doing here? Why is he heading towards the College of Arts building? Why? Why? Why? -He'll catch Boyette dancing! -He'll catch Boyette dancing! He'll go straight to the dance studio! I know! -We need to call Boyette! -Right! Pia, we need to call Boyette right away! Girl! How are we going to reach him? He's not picking up! We can't get to him first! -Let me think! -Ouch! -I'm bleeding! -Shut up! Quiet! -Faster! -Shut up! Okay! I have an idea! What? But Pia... We'll still stay as friends after okay? Okay. Trust me. [smooching] [Pia] He's coming, shut up! Uncle Boy's coming! Catriona! What are you two doing?! You're like dogs mating on the street. Your parents will hear about this! You're minors! Please hear us out! It won't happen again, Uncle Boy! We're sorry! We couldn't help it! We're sorry! Aren't you guys friends? Yes but you know what they say, love works in mysterious ways. I get it but find a private place! This is a school! Respect the school! We weren't thinking straight! We're sorry! It won't happen again. -Sorry, Uncle Boy! -Okay! I won't tell on you. Bye. We're sorry! Okay, fine! Where's Boyette? At the computer lab. At the church! At the pool area! Yeah. Maybe he's there. Or at the library! Yeah! That's highly likely! Library. Wait a minute! You two! Did Boyette ask you to lie to me? Why can't you give me a straight answer? No, sir! People are like that when... -People are like that when... -When they're in love! Confused and on cloud nine! I'll just go up! No! He's not there! Actually, he's there! Right he's there! -Are you sure? -Yes! He's not there! Let's go there, Uncle Boy. He's there! See you at practice tomorrow, okay? See you. Take care. Love you, best friend! [soft guitar music playing] Charles? Yeah? What did you say? What? What did you say again? "I'll see you at practice tomorrow"? After that? "Take care"? After that. "Love you, best friend!" [music playing] I'll go ahead. [music playing] [giggles] [Charles] Love you, best friend! [lively music playing] [Charles] Love you, best friend! [woman] Ouch! What the hell! I'm already late! I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! Pa! Pa? Pa, I love you! Pa! I missed you! What are you doing? I'm looking for signal! I have poor reception here! Look I have one bar. I made chicken sandwich. Let's eat? -Really? -Yeah! Let's go! Ta-da! That's Mom's chicken sandwich recipe. You know my weakness. Of course, Pa! Like mother, like daughter! Mom and I have the same taste in food. Don't worry, Pa! As long as you live, I will always cook for you. Thank you, my son. By the way, why did you come here? I met with a friend. He's from here. We met somewhere near. So I thought to drop by. Who is it? My real mother? Stupid! [chuckles] Your real mother is at peace in heaven! What are you talking about? I know! I'm kidding! So who did you meet with? Remember the one guy who rents your mom's old unit? That's the one. But he's not renting the floor this time. Our internet shop. What? Why do we have to rent it out? We're bankrupt. I can stop school. I can work and help out. Definitely not! All you and Brett have to do is study hard! When you finish school, you can help revive our business. Yes, Dad! Promise! Anyway, just tell your brother. Don't worry about it too much. Take care of your health. Okay? Yes, Dad. I'll go ahead. Your brother is waiting outside. Bye, son. Love you, Pa. Love you too. [pensive music playing] -Ouch! -[boings] Are you even my real friends? Why didn't you tell me my dad's here? You jerk! You're the one who's not picking up calls! Yeah! I even kissed Catriona just to distract your father! So he wouldn't see you dancing! What do you want me to do then? I want to strangle you! Yuck! -Yuck? -Yuck? Girl, I think your friend thinks she looks good in green. But she looks like a highlighter! Very true! And in fact, she's the darkest highlighter! I may look like a dark highlighter, but boys will never choose you! What did you say? -Hold my purse. -[action music playing] Ouch! Now we're talking! -Dude, tag! -Girl, have mercy! Sure, dude! Beat her! -Your turn, dude! Go! -My boobs! Quick! Dude, I'm dying! -Just one finishing move! -Boyette no! Okay, all together now! -One! Two! Three! -[bell ringing] Announcement! We will have our team building this weekend! Those who have strict parents, those who cannot come, you'll miss the fun. Are you going? I'm worried about one thing. Worried if my dad will allow me. Girl! You will miss the fun [Pia] What's this, another general meeting? [Catriona] I won't stay long. [screaming] Brett?! What are you doing?! We're playing... charades! Actually she's winning already. Bro, this is my girlfriend Macy. Macy, this is my brother. We'll continue the game outside. You better make sure that you two are playing charades! Just charades! Yes, I promise. Also, I'll make this quick... so that we can go home early tomorrow. Actually, Actually Brett... I can't come home tomorrow. Because... we have a team building. Can you do me a favor? Can you not tell Dad? Because I'm going to make an excuse that we're doing a school project. Please? Okay fine, but I will not go home either. Okay? Okay. We'll just play outside. Such a flirt! What? That was crazy! Super! By the way girls, this is what we'll do. We'll film a fake video and we'll pretend that we're doing a school project. Then I'll send it to my father and I will tell him... that's the reason why I cannot go home, because we're busy! But the truth is, I'm at the beach. Okay? Boyette, please. We all know you're doing this for your mom's dream. But do we really have to do this? You already have a mountain full of lies, is that what you want? Of course I know that. In fact, I feel so guilty for all the lies I tell my father. Girls, hear me out. Ever since I got asthma, I never went to the beach again. He would always tell me that the sand might get into my lungs. What a joke right? So please. Help me. Please? Okay? Thank you. My son is very good. He studies even on weekends. Wow. [chuckles] Dad, don't be fooled. They don't go to the same class. That's fake. Maybe they are up to something. [Bitoy] That's fake! [Baduding] That's not fake, Boyette is not like you. [Bitoy] Don't try to challenge me! [Baduding] You want to fight me so bad! Bring it on! -Oh really? -I will never lose to you! You don't know what you're up against. Rock, Paper, Scissors! Rock, Paper, Scissors! Rock, Paper, Scissors! -[laughs] -[boings] Rock, Paper, Scissors! -[boings] -[laughs] Ouch! That's not me! -She doesn't want to stop. -Of course not! Please don't! That's for the water! -[boings] -[screaming] [screaming] [Charles] Wow, we can ride jet skis! Oh, my god! Love it! They have white sand over there. Oh my gosh! Let's go there! Wait, I think I see some cutie! Wow! This is so nice! Girl! Why is your face like that? This is a beach okay? Not a morgue! Did I put too much sunblock? Yes! You look like a walking twinkie! Oh, really? Ouch! You're always pulling my hair! If you keep doing that, after this movie, I will be left with only three strands of hair! Excuse me, you call that hair? To be specific... pubic hair?! Great! Amazing! Our first game is called, pass the coconut with a twist. At the end of the line, the coconut should transform into a coconut dessert! 3! 2! 1! Go! [cheering] [thuds] [Nancy] Oh my gosh! -[romantic music playing] -[heart beating] Is it heavy? Do you have to hold it together? Oh, my god! Ouch! Ouch! My feet! [upbeat music playing] -Coconut salad! -[cheering] [Sir Cei] Next game, kayak race! [chuckles] [Boyet] Faster, they may catch us! [Charles and Boyet whooping] I'm so wet! [Sir Cei] And the winner is... -Charles and Boyet! -[cheering] [Charles] Nice one best friend! [Nancy] Oh no! Why is your underwear yellow? Stop it. Whats up girl! They're so close! -[shrieks] -[chuckling] You're mean! I'll support your feelings! Let me handle this. -Is that a dolphin? -It's a dolphin! Careful! They might fall! It's a beautiful day! [shrieks] Ouch! Super itchy! Ouch! Boyet, can you put some lotion on my back? It's so itchy! -Please? -Ok fine! Those ants are annoying. Put it on my neck. Ouch, Boyet that's harsh. -[music playing] -Ouch, you're hurting me! Ouch! I told you to be gentle. [dings] [scoffs] [Nancy] Annoying! He's not even cute! Ouch! Charles! Hey! We're not yet done! Charles! Bro! Are you okay, bro? Stand up! Do it slowly! It hurts, best friend. Boyet, what did you do?! Hi! -Bro, are you ok? -Of course! Are you jealous? Why would I get jealous? Then why is your face like that? Because I paid for that jet ski and I can't even use it! # I suddenly go boom boom # # My heart goes vroom vroom # # My eyes go zoom zoom # # Every time I see you # # Boom boom # # My heart goes vroom vroom # # My eyes go zoom zoom # # Every time I see you # # I never thought That I'd fall for you # # Every time I see you # # I never thought # We need more liquor. -Thank you, Charles. -For what? For making me realize that I am bigger than my sickness. Because of you, I'm closer to my dream. Just promise me this. Whether we win or lose in the Manila Inter-U Dance Competition, we'll keep on dancing 'til we travel the whole world. Promise? Promise! [chuckles] [both] Best friend! Best friend, we've known each other for a long time, right? Yes. [both chuckle] A very long time. [chuckles] So? I have to tell you something. I hope it's okay. You and Nancy are friends right? A little. Why do you ask? I want to court her. Can you be my wingman? What? You like Nancy?! Yes, for a long time now. Ever since we joined the dance company. Actually, I tried courting her several times. But I think I really need your backup. Nancy! I think Boyet and Charles are talking about you. Girl! Look at Boyet! Work it girl! There, work it! Perfect! Nice one! Charles! Hey! Final answer? Promise? Yes! Yes! I love her! I love Nancy! Only Nancy! What now best friend? Are you going to help me? Best friend! Hey... Best friend? Are you crying? Did I say something wrong? Of course not. Why would I cry? [chuckles] I'll just get some drink. I'll get you a drink, too. [comical sound] Hey pretty boy! Hi! What are you doing?! Why are you crawling? [chuckles] Getting drunk. You're not a mermaid! Sit down! Help me. Careful! What's your secret? You haven't done anything and yet Charl- [scoffs] People like you. [scoffs] I'm already doing everything so they will like me. My mom? She doesn't love me. [chuckles] Know what? Everything I do, whether it's right or wrong, I can't really feel her love. That's okay. I get you. We're the same. [sniffles] The person I love, can't love me back. [laughs] What? [sniffles] Okay, I get it. I get it. Go ahead, kiss me. What are you saying?! Kiss me. Go ahead. [retches] Boyet, you're taking so long. [smooches] Boyet. Boyet, I'm waiting. Boyet, where are you? [smooches] Tastes like sweat. Do you want another one? [giggles, smooches] You're so silly! Boyet?! I got two kisses! [shrieks] We already told you that Charles is straight. He won't love you like how you love him. What the hell Boyette? I thought you're in a life and death situation! Do you know that Papa is sick? Pia! Papa is just a dog. I'm your friend! I'm surprised that you still treat us as a friend! I thought friends are meant to listen to each other's advice. So not you! Now I know why your Dad is so strict! You're so stubborn! Pia! Guys! You know what? I will pull your hair! Go ahead and try it! [comical music playing] Ouch! Bring it back! -Ouch! -You didn't expect that right? Give that to me! Bring it back! [music stops] [Boyet] Charles! Best friend! Don't you dare take a step. Why? I'm farting. [comical, farting sound] That's okay! Are you mad? Is there a reason for me to be mad? [scoffs] None. Nice, so when are you gonna tell me the truth? You- you already know? [scoffs] I saw everything. Charles! Let me explain- Go ahead and explain to me why your faces are so close to each other. What? You kissed her? I didn't kiss Nancy okay? Oh, really? Then what could that be? Answer me! What? It's because she's drunk! Okay? And then she thought I was you. If only you hear what she's saying. Do you know what she's saying? Charles my love, kiss me kiss me Really?! Yes, best friend! Promise? Yes! Promise! Cross my heart. Nancy likes you. So that's the reason why she's befriending you, so that she'll get close to me? Yes, exactly. But of course, I will still help you court her. I'm so sorry to think that you'll lie to me. You're right. I can really trust you. I'll go ahead. I have stuff to do. Okay. You're friends with Charles? Uncle Alfred? I'm Boyet Camacho. [in gay slang] Oh my God! Is that you? Are you Suzette's son? Yes, it's me. You're all grown up! Good thing you're still friends with my son? Yes. We met again at this college. Do you want to talk to Charles? I tried many times but he won't talk to me. Why? What happened? If you don't mind. [orchestral music playing] Because you slay the runway? [laughs] No. Because his dad is gay. I'm gay. I don't have the courage to tell my wife and my son. Of course I was scared so I hid it. But the problem is... they saw me kissing a man. [gasps] Don't you worry. I believe Charles will still forgive you. Because every child has a place in their heart reserved for their parents. I hope so. [sighs] So...Boyette Even if you don't tell me, I know you're not telling Charles the truth... that you're gay. How did you know I'm gay? Hello! You understand my fabulous vocabulary from the start! [chuckles] Oops! Sorry! I hope... you can tell him everything. Before your friendship gets ruined. Don't be like me. I was weak and a coward. I lied to myself. Charles... I need to tell you something. I'm gay. [laughs] [gasps] What did you say?! [screaming] I'll get beaten by him! Okay Boyette. Take it slowly. Keep calm. No acting-acting! Charles... I need to tell you something. I'm gay. -[panting] -[gasping] What did you say?! [screaming] I will still get beaten! This is crazy! What if I go straight to the point? Sincere? Okay. Charles, I need to tell you something. I'm gay. [comical sound] Everybody already knows that, brother. [loud screaming] You scared me! You pop out of nowhere! I have news for you. [suspense music plays] What? [sighs] -[music stops] -Brother... You're about to be an aunt. What are you trying to say? Big Brother is pregnant? How will he get pregnant when he doesn't even have a girlfriend? Then who among us three is pregnant? It can't be me, I don't have a uterus! Right?! [gasps] BRETT!!! OH MY GOD BRETT!!! [panting] You got Macy pregnant?! My God! [panting] How will you raise a child when you're a child yourself?! Bro, I'm begging you. Don't tell this to Dad. I promise, I'll tell this to him when I'm ready. And I promise to be there for Macy. That's the right thing to do. Because she and the baby inside her is your responsibility now. We can do this, okay? [dramatic music playing] [music stops] [thuds] Macy- Where's Brett? I'm sorry but I don't know where my brother is. Maybe you'll know where he is if I tell everyone the truth that you're gay Excuse me! and you're just pretending to be straight. Are you trying to blackmail me? I know everything. Brett told me everything. I wonder what will happen if you get exposed? Are you still going to be friends with Charles? Or Nancy? Will you still dance? You better think about this. [dramatic music plays] DAD, I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. [gasps] Bro... Dad? What a great brother! You are one of a kind! You are such a role model! Acting too goody when in fact you can't even keep a word?! Sorry. -Dad... -Shut up! I told you to shut up! Dad, I'm not even talking! [comical sound] Fine. -Dad-- -I told you not a word! Shut it. Boyet, don't go home today. You might see how I reprimand your brother! You'll get an attack! -Let's go. -Come on! -You better prepare! -Lets go. -Get ready! -Let's go! [sobbing] Girls. What will I do? I'm so sure that Brett will reveal my secrets! And then there's Macy who blackmails me! She told me she will expose me to Charles! What will I do? [sobs] I can't fulfill my dreams anymore! It's all about you again?! It's all about your dreams again? [Boyet sobs] We better leave! Wow! What a friend! Damn you! Tell that to yourself! What a friend! Boyette! We never left you even if you make stupid decisions! And all we ever hear is your childish whining about your dreams?! Or let me get that straight, you're whining about the dreams of your mother! [thuds] Then leave! I don't need you, get out! Yes! I will certainly leave! Please stop! Both of you stop! Pia, what happened, why are you acting like that? Papa is dead. I am already on my way home, so I can be with him one last time but I can't because this ungrateful faggot needs us! Girl, that's just a dog! Me, I'm your friend! And your real Dad died a long time ago! You have to move on! I'm sorry, it's not my fault that my real father is already dead. I never wanted that to happen! But you! You wanted all of this! We tried everything to warn you but you never listen! Because all you think about is yourself! Boyette, the world does not revolve around you! Wake up! You already hurt a lot of people! So all the problems that you have right now, you're the only one to blame for it! Pia! [Kylie crying] -Pia, guys, what's happening? -Stop it! Boyette! Let's go. Catriona that hurts! Kylie...Catriona...Sorry. [sobbing] Sorry... Sorry... -Go Nancy! -Fight for it. What is the fuss all about? -Confess already. -Hey. -It's working, right? -What's happening? [Boyet] Charles... Yes? Best friend? I was able to talk to your father. Why did you talk to that dead man? [Nancy] Okay, uhm.. Oh my God! I have never been this nervous! I can't. Okay. [clears throat] I grew up believing that life is short. And we must follow our heart's desire. That's why I'm here, I'll follow my heart. Boyet, I love you. [crowd screaming] Nancy! Wait, this can't be! I have to tell you something! Boyet, the first time I saw you my heart screamed. "Shit! He's the one!" I made a video to prove this to you. Please watch it Boyet. [music playing on video] [sighs] [Nancy giggles] Boyette? Boyette! -You're straight now? -Dad? [crowd exclaiming] I thought there's nothing between the two of you? Then what's that?! -Charles that's not true... -[inaudible crowd gossip] -Nancy! -Boyet what is he saying?! You told me there's nothing between the two of you! That's what you told me Boyet! [crowd chattering] -What's this?! What's happening?! -Tell the truth already Boyet! -Tell me what's all of this! -Charles, please... What! [screams] Stop! Just wait! Let me explain first. I'm just gathering enough courage to tell you all about this. But I think I took more time than I needed. It's too late now. Nancy... Nancy, you are important to me. You're one of my closest friends. But I'm sorry I can't love you the way you love me. Because the person who has my heart is... Charles. [crowd murmuring] I just can't tell you the truth. I'm scared. 'Cause I know that you will hate me! Sorry Charles. Sorry. I did this because I want to fulfill my mom's dream of dancing in Japan. To travel the world... But I assure you, that if there's one truth to all I'm saying, it's the fact that I love you. Why did you have to fool me like that? What! [Boy] That's enough. What! -Charles... -You're disgusting! Cool your head. You are just like my father! [panting] You are both liars! Cheaters! What? You want to punch Boyet? Choose me! Punch me! [comical sound playing] [Kylie screams] Guys... [Boy] That's enough. Relax, take some air. [Boyet coughs] [panting] Both of you fooled me. You really are brothers! You are both crazy! All my life, I was always his chaperone. I'm the youngest, yet I was the one who needs to take care of him. Am I not going to have my own life? That's why you got some girl pregnant is that correct?! And you, Boyette, you disregarded everything I do for you. You lied! Don't I mean anything to you? You don't obey me! You don't respect me! [Boyet sobs] Dad... Ever since I was a kid. All I ever did was to obey you. This is the first time that I disobeyed you. I hope you understand me. Understand you?! All my life, all I do is to understand you. How about me? Do you understand me? You're so stubborn! You know that dancing can kill you, yet you still do it. Because whenever I dance, that's the only time I feel normal and free. [sniffles] I just wanted to feel free even if it's just temporary. I wanted to be me. Since when did you face me as not yourself? When?! I accepted everything about you. Your demeanor, your choice of clothes, your choice of friends. Did you hear me complain? Did you hear me complain?! I'm doing all of this, because I love you I love you. [sobs] Because of that love, I feel like I'm in prison. Dad, I'm not stupid. [sniffles] I know that I'm sick and you're worried about me. But if I will die of this sickness... I wanted to tell myself, that I was able to do everything I want. Stop it. Stop it, son. Let's just end this conversation. Go to sleep. Dad, if I'm going to die today, I wanted to tell myself that I was able to go to all the places I wanted! Stop, just stop. Dad, I wanted to be myself. I said stop. I wanted to be me but I can't because of you! [screams] I said stop! You don't really listen! The reason why I'm like this is because- Because... Because I don't want you to end up like your mother. I don't want you to die because of me. I can't bear losing another loved one. [sobs] Dad. Dad, what do you mean to die because of you? What's that all about? Your mom died because of me. If only I didn't allow her to dance... She could still be with us. [sobbing] I can't find any work then, there's so much bills to pay. Your mom talked to me. If she can accept this gig being offered to her. Dance reunion of their group. We needed money, so I agreed. She finished the concert. But that's the last time she was able to dance. Her asthma attacked and she died of cardiac arrest. She didn't make it alive in the hospital. If only I was a good husband, If only I have work. She could still be alive today. I wish... I wish I died instead. No, Dad. That's not true. Dad, I'm sorry. Son, I know I am strict to you. But that's because I don't want to lose you. You're right. You're right, there's a big world outside this house. And whatever I do as your dad, I have to accept that you're all grown-up. Please forgive me. Dad, please don't blame yourself. [tuts] We love you very much. After what the Camacho family went through, they still chose to forgive and to love each other. This is Charot Santos, and I'm here to remind you, that you are the hero of your story. This is "Your Story", good evening to you. [music stops] I know that we are facing a challenge right now. But let's not make that a reason to stop fighting. Okay? [crowd cheering] Let's remember the reason why we're here. Let's keep this fire burning! Nancy... I'm sorry. I hope you forgive me. I realized that I was selfish. I was very wrong in using you. You're such a drama queen! [crowd cheering, applauding] Why is that faggot still here? Because he's still a member of MU Dance Company! Charles? Charles! Best friend... Boyette, don't. Boyette come here, let him go. [sighs] Charles. Can we talk? Can you get out of my sight? If you think I can forgive you, you're wrong. You are just like my father! Both of you are fake! Fine! Because you can't accept that you were hurt but you were able to hurt others too! Yet you choose to be angry. [sniffles] You choose to not forgive. [sobbing] Son, is there something wrong? Boyette, what's happening? [sighs] Charles... Charles wait. Charles please, I'm begging you. Please listen to me. Can you not talk to me anymore? You ruined my life. You ruined our lives! My mom, my brother, you ruined everything! [sniffles] I lost my family. And it's all because of you! I don't know how many times I have to say sorry. I'll say sorry my whole life, I will never get tired. It's because I love you, my son. [crying] I love you so much my son. And you never left here. I hope that someday, you'll find it in your heart to forgive us. [bawling] Pia, I'm sorry. You're right! I was selfish. [sighs] It's fine. Don't worry about it. Besides... [tuts] We're still young. We'll still commit a lot of mistakes. But what's important is that we learn from them, right? And besides, we're all friends here. We should be supporting each other. This is my gift for you. A replacement for Papa. [Boyet chuckles] Thank you, really. I will never forget who I am again. The world is huge and I can pretend to be anyone. But I won't do that. I'll choose to be me. Period. No erase. Locked. Key thrown into the sea. In the middle of the Pacific Ocean. This is me, not you, not him, but simply me. -Amazing! -Amazing! I'm amazing, right? [cheering] Hug! [cheering, applause] Good day to all of you! Today will be filled with groove! My name is Kaladkaren Davila. And I'm your one and only bestie, Jhai Ho! Go change! Quick! - Can we do this? - Yes. Charles isn't here. [Nancy] Yes. Yes! We can! [clapping, cheering] Best friend. Best friend. I finally came into my senses. I didn't get mad at you because you're gay. I got mad because you lied to me. But I forgive you. What's important is our friendship is still what matters. [Charles] Guys... Can I still join? Anytime! [cheering, clapping] The winner of Manila Inter-U Dance Competition will be the Philippines' representative for the finals which will be held in the Land of the Rising Sun- Japan! Wow! Let's call in the first contender. The Groovers from the Near Eastern University! [cheering, applause] [electronic dance music playing] Oh my God! They're good! Our Father who art in heaven... Best friend, you've been praying non-stop. Huh? I'm not praying. Then who am I hearing? [gasps] Oh! It's Sir Cei! Why? Come here! You pray! You look like you have a good connection with God! Yeah! Come on. I think you're God's favorite. Go talk to Him. Ask him to guide us. Close your eyes. [angelic music playing] [electronic dance music continues] [Kaladkaren] Oh my God! That was amazing! My God! Do it again. My God! Your energy's amazing! That was only our first school! But it really feels like the finals already! That's how good everyone is, DJ Jhai!

[flatlining] [man 1] Hello? [man 2] Hello! Is this a flashback? Ma. I don't remember this scene. This is not a memory, honey. What? What's this then? [piano music playing] Oh my God! I'm dead? Soon, if you don't stop from dancing. Wow, mom! That hurt! [sighs, tuts] My son, come here! I've missed you. Son, life is just like... just like dancing. Sometimes you do the steps wrong. But that's fine. What's important is that you followed your heart. Because you heart will bring you to your real destination. But son, you should open your heart, okay? What does that mean, mom? I did that. I did follow my heart. And you know where it led me? Straight to the floor. Okay, listen. Dancing paved the way for your father to notice and eventually love me. Because of that, I learned what would really make me happy. It's not dancing? No, my son. My real happiness is you. To be your father's wife. To be your mother. That is my real dream. Dance was just an instrument to reaching that dream. You are the fulfillment of my dreams, Boyette. You followed your heart. You stood for what you believe is right for you. You danced and you amazed the crowd. The reality is you easily get sick... Like me. So, maybe... You can find another dream? Boyette, you'll discover a lot of things. You're still young. Don't rush into wearing shoes that don't fit you yet. Thank you, Ma. I will never forget that. But if dancing is not for me, then what is? Ma? Ma? Ma! [comical sound] Ma! Tell me. Only you will know the answer. Ma, come on! Give me a clue. Really? You still don't get it? [Suzette laughs] At that exact moment, I saw the light. Very bright, in fact! Blindingly bri- What's this? [Nancy] Boyette! Fluorescent? I can't live without you! - Where am I? - Boyet, please! I can't live without you! Who's that voice from? Oh, my God! Nancy... Yes? Don't squeeze Juniper. Oh my! Sorry! Sorry, Boyette! I'm just so happy! You're not the mother, right? [comical sound] Right. [Boy] Go. My son, how are you feeling? You let yourself become too tired. But the doctor assured us that everything's fine. Next time you dance, bring your inhaler, okay? Pa... Sorry if I made you worry. You are as important as my life. I don't want you to blame yourself if anything happens to me. So, from now on, I will obey you. I will stop dancing. But thank you for letting me experience my dream. Son, but- I'm happy with my decision. Promise, Pa. Best friend... I'm okay now, Charles. I proved myself that I can be courageous. That I can fight for what I want and who I am. But I also realized that freedom comes with responsibility. Don't worry about me. Nancy, I'm sorry if we lost because of me. Lost? I know that we lost because I passed out on stage. Lost? What are you talking about? We won the Manila Inter-U Dance Competition! We're competing in Japan! All-expense paid! Really? Life goes on for this little twink! I still went to Japan but not as a dancer. I was Charles and Nancy's third wheel. They actually ended up together. Whatever! I'm sure I'll finish college with flying colors... Because I'm with my friends. Look at us strutting around campus. Excuse me, you dropped your jaw because of my beauty. But my biggest winning moment, is when my dad allowed me to shift courses. So, goodbye, IT! Hello, Bachelor of Arts in Fashion Design! Hello to my shop, Tailor Swift Dress Shop! [toinks] I'm a witty twink! There will be an additional blessing to our family because Macy will give birth soon. My family are the most important persons in my life. Except for this one. And, I'm now a famous tailor in our town. I do gowns for weddings, christenings, even burials. Next year, I'm sure I'll be doing gowns for the whole Philippines! 2020 is my year! I can feel it! [pings] GIRL! DON'T BE SHOCKED! WE'LL HAVE TO POSTPONE OUR PLANS BECAUSE WE WILL BE ON LOCKDOWN BECAUSE OF COVID 19! THERE'S A LAW THAT WE CAN'T GO OUT. THE PANDEMIC IS REAL! COVID 19? Pandemic? Lockdown? This is crazy!
