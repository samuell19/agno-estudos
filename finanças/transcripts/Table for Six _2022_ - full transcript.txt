Whoa, what's...? Password! The new one or the old one? Why would I want the old one? As a memento, perhaps? You're up to something! To be fair, there are a million possibilities. Like what? For example... Maybe I'm proposing. I typed the proposal down and I don't want you to know. Really? No. Just an example. Hell, spill it! - No. - Say it! No! You have to! No way! Why? Up to no good? - Dude, that costs $4,000! - Say it! - Dude, that costs $4,000! - No! - Give her something cheaper... - Say it! -Give her something cheaper... —I'LL say it. - And less lethal. - Now I don't wanna hear it. You won't tell me? |W|guessiL Go ahead. I changed it back to your birthday. It doesn't work. October 5th, right? It's October 25th, asshole! You changed your birthday? Why did you add eight big-titted "Double May"? Who's May? What's that? Never heard of it. You just love big tits! I've never loved big tits! Do you love me? What? (Loveh Of course I love you. So my tits aren't big enough! And they're all barely legal! You just love young girls! I don't love young girls! Do you love me, then? What happens if I say no? You don't love me? No, of course I love you! So I'm too old! Come on... I'm too old. I have small tits. No wonder you haven't married me! When was the last time you put money in our joint account? Where's the money? I bought uniforms for my esports team, they're expensive. It's not for randos... Rando?! The team members are the stars! Everyone else is randos! What about the rest of the cash? This thing... It costs 40 grand. Wow, 40 grand? That prick! I just bought it! Don't scratch it! Hey hey hey! - Chill out! - Give me a reason! It's rising in value! SQ? I can sell it for 45 grand! SQ? If you smash that, you'll have to clean it up! Lung Chan! You promised me a home! You already cook here a few times a week. We watch TV and chill. It already feels like a home! Just bear it for now. I've been bearing it for 12 years! I'm done bearing! We're breaking up. It's over! Don't even think about winning me back again. Go after her! Hey. Watch the stove. Soup's cooking. You dick. I almost lost 40 grand. If I say I spent it, she'll still believe that I'm earning money! If I say otherwise, she'll make me change jobs. If you're already working and you find another job, that's "changing jobs". If you're not making a penny, you're just "volunteering". The family is paying your expenses, so you're "leeching". I'm "leaping" to success! I'm an esports athlete! When I win that tournament, I'll make my first million dollars! You know... The biggest hurdle to happiness is expecting too much from the future. Another "Chicken Soup" quote? Stop dragging your feet and get hitched. What? —I'LL pay for the banquet. Getting married will put some sense into your head. Objection. He hasn't objected. Why are you objecting? Because it's dumb. Why? Wait. I want to object to your objection. What? I can get married, sure. But I need a fair exchange. Sell our home. Let's cash in. My esports team is heading towards glory. All we lack is funding. If we get a few mil as investment and win the tournament, we'll be Hong Kong esports' Juventus F.C. or even the Avengers!! My room... Hot in summer, cold in winter. The party room upstairs blasts off-key karaoke all day. We moved in over a decade ago and the living room still reeks of BBQ pork! For the last time... We follow Mom's dying wish. Our home stays, the oven stays, and Dad stays. We're never selling this place. I'm going to work. Don't forget! I ordered hotpot delivery for tonight. Look at your brother. His sense puts me at ease. He even booked his own birthday dinner. Maybe he's up to no good. That's crazy talk... Big Brother, - you'll be here before dinner, right? - Yeah. I'm off early today. I want to talk to you. Sure. Hello, Mr. Steve Chan? Is the red gate your building's entrance? It's "shot"! She must mean "shut". She should just stick to Mandarin. That "iz" the back "doo". Walk "pat" the back 'doo'. Keep "wooking", then turn "light" at the corner. That big "doo" is the "man" entrance. Is that Little Meow from "Taiwan's Little Meow in Hong Kong"? So what? Is she popular? All the netizens cream over her. Ma'am, are you going up? If I can get her as our cheerleading captain, we'll have ad revenue. With the Hong Kong Champion title... Leave my model alone. Hi. Enter. You packed all "deez" by yourself? You can speak Cantonese. I understand it. Fantastic. Is your makeup applied? Huh? Have you put on makeup? Oh, I just need a touch-up. Change there. Leave Bernard's clothes alone. They're his babies. I think I can carry this one. Don't do anything stupid. I hear you. Hi. The air conditioning is chilly. Put this jacket on. You look gorgeous in this. Pardon me. I'm his colleague. My name's Lung. Like the organ? It's Chinese, actually. L-U-N-G Lung It means "Dragon". Then... why don't you just use "Dragon"? It's cooler. Right... Has anyone told you you look like Rei from "Evange|ion"? I actually have another identity. I'm an esports athlete. - If... - Lung Chan! So she's Rei when she wears it, and I'm a ran do! That's cute. Why didn't you come after me? I forgot to. You got caught red-handed. We're breaking up. What should I do first? Put out the fire first? That's right. Baby! - Hey! - Why are you already back? Something's boiling over. That happens a lot here! Over there! Hey. I'm ready. How do you want to shoot this? Just follow the reference. Intimate, elegant... Sexy, too. Sure. Hold it up. Elegance... Hold it higher. Be one with the cooker. Open it elegantly... Now close it slowly. Open. Close. Open slowly. Close. Open... Close... Okay, the other side now. Don't worry, it's only a dozen strands if I cut it. It's okay.. Ahh. It's okay, I took off a few already. It hurts. It can't be. Did I cut a nerve? I'm so embarrassed! It's just an accident. This whole time, I was playing it cool so you'd think that I'm a pro... Play it cool? What for? The fact is... I'm your fan! I like you so much! Your black-and-white portrait of Danielle Graham for "Yes" magazine was my fav! You're for real. You showed me that the key aspects of a portrait are the expressions in the eyes. You're an inspiration! That's a big deal... - Look. - That's not Danielle Graham, right? No, it's your Studs and the City spread. Yikes! The original model went AWOL, so I had to step in. They got a lot of complaints for that issue. But there was at least one letter of praise. Don't tell me that you're Kitty Cat, that fourth grader from Taiwan? Yeah! You remember me! I've... Ow! Wow, you're all grown up... Yup, I've grown up. If there's a chance, we can grab a meal together. Is that okay? Sure. I always get beef noodles at the diner downstairs. I always sit alone. Are you 93V? Look, young|ady... I'm just not ready for a new relationship yet. When it comes to destiny... If you take it too easy, you'll miss out on it. But if you take it too seriously, you'll cry over it. Holy... Is it because... of her? When did you split up? Not long ago. How long ago? Three years ago. You're so devoted... When did you come home? Just now, I forgot a document. Hey, something's up. Dinner's off. Don't come up. I'll explain tomorrow night. Remember! Reply when you get this. What's her name? Monica. What is she like? Like an angel. You bitch! You're painting graffiti over them? Someone just picked them off the streets. They're trash. You're trash! The one who picked them up was me! Listen up, they are historical artifacts! The youngest piece is over 30 years old! I'm over 30 years old, too. You call me trash all the time! What's going on, 9W5? Boss, they want to graffiti over these. No! I thought you're doing it Yayoi Kusama style That's right. What? For the last few years, you've been scavenging all this stuff for the "Hong Kong Stories" series. They're royalty-free and gimmicky. It was nice. But it has become boring now. We need noise that is as loud as those giant malls. It'll be fresh! And it'll promote Hong Kong culture. Open mind. Open. Sure, I'll call Yayoi Kusama to see if she'll take lower pay for "Hong Kong culture". Naturally, we'll just copy her without paying. Yes! Hong Kong culture! Culture vulture! Yes! Open mind. Open... Open. O, my ass! No freaking way. If you insist on doing this, |'|| quit! Bye! Big Brother! Hey, Big Brother... Even if they aren't getting married, they should move in together. What? "Love is". Why Wait For Him To Change When You Can Just Invade His Space?" It's doable... Remember that I asked to talk? Relax... Trust me, it's no big deal. Something wrong? Nothing. Actually, in a little while, something's going to happen. What is it? Promise me, when I open the door, chill out, okay? What is it? Nothing. Takeout delivery. $3,950, please. $3,950?! I can't be chill about that. Five bags... That's nearly $800 per bag! It doesn't matter. It's on me anyway. You're really up to something. When you ordered that $1,000 takeout the other time, something really did happen. - What was it? - You screwed my wife. What? You took that junk trip with those girls and dropped my camera into the sea. You literally sank 30 grand! What is it this time? We're brothers... When Chow Yun-fat said that in "A Better Tomorrow", he got shot in the head. Watch it. Come on, let me finish... You even made the soup? I didn't make it. - Listen... - There you are, you took so long. When'd you get home? I've been home all afternoon. I thought you went after Josephine. Did you really break up? We made up already. So you made the soup? Dinner's ready! I made two soups tonight. This mala spicy soup was made with Sichuan erjing tiao chilies. It's numb, then spicy, then sweet. Big Brother, you can't do spicy, so I made you a silkie chicken soup. - Perfect for a man your age. - Good girl. You split more often than a banana. We can't keep up with you. As long as they patch things up. Sit down, Josephine, we have to talk. Let's cover my stuff first. No, this first. Sit down, Josephine. You have forged an inseparable bond with our family. You've been with our little brother for so many years. You're practically family, right? I'm focused on my career now. I'm not looking to get married. With an attitude like that, no point in forcing him, right? I'm not asking you two to get married. I'm inviting you to move in here. That's not a good idea... What do you mean?! I'm respecting her family's rules. Her granny said, as long as she's unmarried, she can't spend a night at a guy's place. But she stayed here last night. Hey, I told you! Don't stay over just because your granny sleeps early. There, I warned her. That's why I've thought of an excuse that means little but actually makes a world of difference. On paper, you're not moving in. You're working here. So, starting tomorrow, the three of us (Will pa)! You- You move in officially and cook us two meals a day. So I'll be like Granny and become an amah? It's different! Amahs don't exist anymore. Don't think like that. So, a domestic worker? No way. Many domestic workers sleep in bathrooms. You share a huge room with Lung. So... I'll be a servant who toils by day and sleeps with Young Master at night? No way! Some young masters marry their young servants. In addition to the food budget, we'll pay you an allowance, too. Well? That's too many surprises. I'm spinning! Why don't the three of you vote on it? Raise your hand if you approve. | Object! You're screwing up my plan! You had a plan? That's cute. Of course! How else can I be Hong Kong Champion? Bernard! I approve! It's good to have someone around at home. Besides, home cooking is good for the health. Welcome. Mi casa, su casa. Thank you, thank you! Welcome, Josephine. Your health is in my hands! Oh, just worry about these two. I'm moving in with my girlfriend soon. What? You're dating? Now you know. Aren't you saving up for a flat? You'll waste money on rent. I'm moving to her place. Then you're leeching off her. I'll pay her rent. Then you'll waste money on rent. What do you want me to do? Be open-minded. I bring all my girlfriends here to eat with you guys. What "girlfriends"? You've only brought ONE home all these years. Who? The one who shattered his heart when she left. Are you all right? I'm fine. Hi. Hi. It's been a long time. Yes. Three years. Really? I wasn't counting. Why... are you here out of the blue? The door was open. So I showed myself in. Why'd you come for me out of the blue? I'm not here for you. I'm here for him. Big Brother. She's my girlfriend. What? Is it April Fools? I really am his girlfriend. The stove! What about this fire? Six months ago, my company worked on their event. We began to talk after we saw each other again. Then we started dating. We've been together for six months. This was what I wanted to talk about. Big Brother? Are you all right, Big Brother? You said you told him and that he's okay with it. - I have enough pressure at work... - I thought telling him before dinner was early enough and that he'd be okay. Why'd you think that there's a tiny chance he'd be okay with this? You really don't understand Steve. You know Josephine. Hi, I'm still here! That's good. You're thinner and prettier! Yup! Have you had dinner? Want to join us? I actually came to eat dinner. Why didn't you tell me? I told you on WhatsApp to stay away. You did? Oh, you did! Congratulations! I'm sorry. I had my reservations about Bernard at first. But then I thought, if I didn't move on from the past, I couldn't welcome a better future. What past? You mean our relationship? I'd forgotten all about that... Handing you over to my little brother... gives this big brother infinite joy. It's your birthday... And you got a girlfriend. A double whammy of happiness! Let's celebrate! I'm so happy! - Let's dig in! - Come on, let's eat. Come, take a seat. Help out! Here. Thanks. Let's sit down. Dig in... Oh, I get it. You wanted to move out because of me? You think I'm a child? We just wanted to spend more time together. You can spend time here, too. Look at them, they're stuck like glue. That's right. Sticking together as a family is priceless! How about this? If you want to spend more time together, I invite you to move in here. Great! I'd welcome that! Maybe not... It's great! We're a family! Only a child would mind. Right, Steve? That's right! We've got a huge place here. One person won't make a difference. Are you still in that subdivided flat? Yeah. That's too small for two. The bed is so small. It gave me terrible backaches back then. If you don't mind, I can move in, actually. That's not what you said yesterday. Well, I'm saying this today. Open mind. But I like staying at your place more. Then she can move in here and you can move over there. Are you sure about this? I have a lot of stuff. We have a lot of room! That's good. No, I don't think... I have a suggestion. Why don't you three vote on it? Raise your hand if you approve. | Object! I approve! It's good to have someone around at home. Sticking together as a family is priceless! Congratulations! - Thanks. - Mi casa, su casa. She's in charge of catering here. Bernard will pay your share. Really? What time is dinner? 08:00 PM Can you cook bigger portions? So I can bring lunch to work. Sure I'm sorry, Steve. I should've told you earlier. Don't be silly, I'm fine. Okay... I'm not fine... But I'll make it fine. I know it's tacky. Say no more. We're brothers... You'll die after saying that. I won't die. I'm your big brother. I can handle anything. Be careful! It's a limited edition. This isn't an invasion. This is a coup! That's worth a fortune! Josephine, you've got a lot of stuff. The kitchenware's brand-new. Aren't you unemployed? Expenditure increases are passed to the customers, naturally. What the! Josephine, are you opening a restaurant? That's not mine. Where do you want it? Who else can that possibly belong to? Let's see if there's room in here, come on. Over here, please. Thanks. Hello? Sure thing! It's for you. Hello? - Hello, Big Brother? - Yeah? Monica's stuff is coming in the afternoon. She said there are signs and a pair of statues. The holy beasts have landed in our realm already. Also... I ordered a new double bed. Can you help me sign for it? Sure. Thanks, Big Brother. You still want the bed? To the landfill, please. Hurry up, or we'll get a ticket! Guys, the bed? It needs assembling. We don't cover assembly! Gosh! You're even assembling their bed for them! Oomph! I'm proud of you! Yup. Oomph! Amazing. You're even assembling their bed for them! Yup. Oomph! I can't believe it... Come on, I have my limits... I didn't think my stuff would take up so much room. Did I overstep your limits? Not at all! My limits can go way lower. My boss wanted to get rid of them, so I have to go Schindler's List and save them one by one! You seem to be more... Emotional? My doctor says I'm too stressed. It's work, part-time PhD and general dissatisfaction with the world. When I'm triggered, I lose my cool. What triggers you? When I see people disrespect heritage, calling everything trash and throwing them away... Perfect, Bernard just bought a new bed. You'll sleep better and de-stress. And the old bed? Is it at the landfill? The old folks' home. I delivered it myself. I told him I'd move my bed here. Why buy one? Your bed is too old. When I rocked it, it... They gave you the wrong manual. Are you serious? Look. It's fine. One less thing to worry about. I'll take my time. It's just a frame. Why'd you keep that ugly old thing? How did that get here? I hate this thing. They made me dress up as a factory girl. It's so ugly! Your company chose you because you're pretty. Have you dated anyone the last few years? No... Nothing long-term. Too many fishes in the pond. You know me, I need to flirt for a long time before I make my move... But there's a girl I'm almost done flirting with. When the time's right, I'll introduce her to you. Sure! Sweetheart. It's okay. Let me. What are you doing? These are cheap stuff. They can go in the living room. Oh? Is this the new bed? Yeah, I assembled it with Steve. Together? Turns out he'll have a girlfriend soon. So don't worry. - He has a girlfriend? - Yeah. Dinner time! Okay! Let's eat! Am I in Mongkok? It really looks like Mongkok in here. Steve said to put them up. It's pretty! Yeah, take a seat. Pork belly and pig's feet? Is this a construction site? I'll open a beer! Your girl looks cultured on the outside, but she's a dude on the inside. How did you know her favorites? Steve asked me to make them. Here we go! That pork belly looks so plump! Steve's not back yet. Should we wait? We agreed that dinner's at 8 sharp. Let's eat! - Yes, let's eat! - Dig in! Here he comes. Careful. Are you ok, Meow? I'm okay. Did you hurt your leg? Are you all right? Everyone. My girlfriend! I'm Ah Meow! Josephine, Give her a seat. Give her a seat. Meow Meow. I'll get some ricey-dicey. Take a seat. Okay. I think I can guess who you are. You're Lung, the little brother I've met. And you're his girlfriend, Josephine. Hi... And... You're the middle brother, Bernard. And you're his girlfriend, Monica. Hi... Aren't you that influencer... Yup! Nice to meet you. Give us a kiss! Lovely! Give us a kiss! Lovely! Lovely! Why are you and my big brother... "It's fate if you believe in it... It's destiny if you don't." He's so well-read! What a naive "Double May"... What's "Double May"? I\ \ Never heard of that. I guess it means she has two... mounts of May? Right... Just a casual family meal, Meow. Thanks. Let's eatsie-peasy! What's with the baby talk? Meow Meow taught me. She said time moves slower for people in love. So ordinary people get a delay when they hear us talk. It sounds like baby talk to you, but we're not actually speaking it. Have some meatsie-poo! Braised pork belly with pickled veg! Let me try this! It's so delicious! Good job! How could you tell it's good just from the pickled vegetable? In this dish, making the pickled veg taste like meat shows a chef's true talent! You know your stuff! This meatsie-poo is really that hardy-tardy to make? It's so hardy-tardy! Do you know how sandy pickled veg can be? It needs a lot of washing. You have to boil and fry the pork belly then stir-fry the salted veg before steaming the whole thing! Do you know how much effort goes into a single bite of this? Did you make it? How did you know? It's obvious. You talk like a MasterChef. I don't know how to cook. But my ex-boyfriend was a hotel head chef. You're so awesome. You should be a culinary influencer! Aren't they really hot? Not necessarily. Your type has plenty of fans, too. There aren't many women under 35 who can do what you do. I'm 40. That's not too old! You should join my team! Meow's team is named "The Ar-meow". It's almost impossible to get in! Why are you such a smarty-putty? You're dating her, you didn't know? We just met a few days ago. There are still plenty left to learn. A few days ago? The spark happened a few days ago. But the seed was planted about... 20 years ago! Buddhist scriptures say we exchange 500 glances before brushing shoulders just once. It looks like it took us 500 shoulder brushes to earn a chance at our first day of love! 500 shoulder brushes, or 500 cold shoulders? You're so lovey-dovey already. Maybe you'll get married soon! Seriously! Give me at least two weeks to get to know him. What do you want to know? Just ask! Don't worry. I have my ways to get intel. Already dating a few days after meeting? Something's fishy here. It's time to guess what I'm playing. Let's start! What's that? A new phone? Don't you know that electronic waste - is destroying... - Calm down, okay? I won't toss the old one. I'll put it away after copying your data over, okay? I can copy it myself. You got some unsavory photos in it? That's absurd... New phone, new bed... What a waste of money. It's worth it. With an ottoman bed, there's storage underneath so we can put other stuff on top. What's an ottoman bed? It has gas lifts for you to lift the bed board. If you let go, it won't fall. Lift it and let go. For real? Yeah, let it go! - For real? - For real. Count to three and let go. One two three Ow!!!!!! Ow!!!!!! Don't be afraid, sweetheart. My arm's just stuck. Can you lift that for me? OW!!!!! It's okay! Again. Lift it. Try lifting the board, too. OW!!!!! What's going on? Why didn't you install the gas lift in the bed? What's a gas lift bed? What year is this?! Let me take you to the hospital. I can take him. Oh, right, the girlfriend goes... Siri, gas lift bed. Lower. Lower. Wow, you really do know photography. - Okay? - Okay_ One of my exes is a photographer. You look so cool in sunglasses! Oh, Whenever I shoot, I look for references. Sometimes, I follow them closely... I know. But I don't think it's a problem. Plagiarizing well is hard! Exactly! But there's something I want to know... How would you shoot it without any reference? Wizard, hang in there. Help me. Water spell! Water spell! Ice spell! Ice spell... I...| can't move... What hit you? Pheromone spell... Who blasted that? My sister-in-law... Steve's in his room. Josephine's on the roof. We are alone in here now Uh-huh... We can quietly... do a background check! Why me? Among everyone in this home, you look the most like... a snitch! Good eye. But it'll cost you! Be my team's cheerleader captain and earn likes for my esports team. What's your team's name? Slooberble. Can you change your team's name first? No. Then let's see what intel you got first. Fine! Our family history is like a spider web! First, my dad and Steve's mother had Steve. I want a divorce! Meanwhile, my mother and Bernard's father had Bernard. So Steve and Bernard, the 12-year-old and the 3-year-old, became brothers! And finally, the most important character... I showed up. Guess how I came about? You are... Your dad and your mom's son! Good job! I'm surprised you figured that out! So this was your dad's BBQ pork kitchen. But you guys moved in here? Right! Steve can't make BBQ pork. Bernard won't make BBQ pork, and I'd rather live like BBQ pork. When the kitchen shut down, we all moved in here. The sign, "Yau Fook"... That's your dad's name? No, my mom's. Mom had a terrible temper with us. She also had a weird rule: Before we turned 30, we had to eat together as a family every night! Steve's carried that tradition to this day. But you're all adults now. How is that possible? It's not that hard. Steve is a shut-in. Bernard spends his cash on collectibles. And I'm poor. As long as Steve pays for dinner, we're happy to oblige! What about his ex, Monica? They met at work. It was like Cleopatra and Antony for a few years. Who? It was the pairing of a century. Big Brother really loved her, but she was into conservation and cultural research so she was too busy or whatever. Conservation? Just like Bernard's Monica... Steve's Monica is bald! And six feet tall! What? Then... why would he like me? Rain's coming, gotta get the laundry. There's no rain... Hey! Bald? I signed for that delivery of signages. Where's the thumb drive? The USB thumb drive! What USB drive? The one from back then! You want to watch it? I want it obliterated, crushed, and diced! Make it vanish for good! That's electronic waste... Don't start on that now. I'll look for it. You didn't hide it carefully?! I was watching it a lot for a while., I don't remember where I put it. It's only on that drive? There's no other copy? I don't think so. Be more certain! None. What color is it? Red...| think. Be more certain! It's red. Hurry, Bernard will be home soon. So? We've got nothing to hide. If Bernard asks why you're in my room, how would you answer? I'm looking for something. What are you looking for? Move it! I thought it's red. Just pour out everything and look. Next time, ping me on WhatsApp so there's no misunderstanding. Right... I forgot you prefer texts rather than speaking face-to-face. What? Never mind. What are you trying to say? Nothing, I've forgiven you. Forgiven what? Nothing! When you're ready, just text me whatever you wanted to say. There! See? What? Never mind. Just be out with it already. I have to remind you that you dumped me on WhatsApp? The one who dumped me on WhatsApp W88 you! It was you! Never mind. Let's stop debating. No matter how immature you are, it's all in the past now. Why don't we break up? Your words were so cruel. You practically forced me to break up. What did I say? Researching artifacts is such a waste of time. I don't know when you'll wake up! You spent so much time researching artifacts that you're always up late. I didn't know what time you'd wake up. What's wrong with that? Your worries don't matter to me, "you should live however you want!" Don't add punctuations. The night before that, you were worried about your weight. I said, Your worries don't matter. To me, you should live however you want! Well, you can't twist this one: Never mind the past. "Anyway, we're shit together!" OK bye! I meant Anyway, we're a fit together! | Typed too quickly! That's a real coincidence. Look at how close "a", "s" and "f" are! That's why I added an "OK". Wasn't that a question? There's no question mark. What about the "bye"? It's polite to end a conversation with a "bye". I told you to work on your spelling. It was just a typo... So our four-year relationship went kaput because I made one typo? Why didn't you contact me? You told me to never contact you again. You pighead! Would you go kill yourself if I asked? How do you know I wouldn't? So what are we supposed to do? I'll confess to Bernard. But it'll be hard on you. Then we'll elope. But Bernard will be hurt! Then we'll have an affair. But I'll be exhausted! Whatever, we have to be together! I guess it was fate. Right, fate. And we're mismatched anyway, right? Right! Looking at you now, I don't feel any love or whatever... Just saying it gives me chills now. Bernard and I are great now. We're practically meant to be soulmates! Same with me and Meow. Soulmates. We're all... soulmates! Ah Meow's here? She's in the shower. Bird poop landed on her head, so she needs a shower. Bernard. Hi! Honey? Why are you calling from your room? I left a present for you in the bathroom! What? Why would you put it there? It's a surprisey-dicey! |'|| go get it! Hey, you're home! How did you get here? I was right behind you. The doctor told you to relax your arm... It hurts. Don't worry. Present... Honey, where is it? I can't find it. Allow me. Brand new! Honey... I'm so touched! You are already asking me to move in? I'll think about it. Why did you keep that old thing? How did that get here? This is Josephine's first step to becoming a culinary influencer. This meal is creativity meets fine dining! Pork for beef. Beef for pork. Crab for fish. Fish for crabs! We also have sweet bitter melon soup. Bitter melon jelly! It's a dessert! There's more! Rainbow rice! Thank you! Bravo! Give serious comments, all right? Let's eat! Let's eat! Honey, try some meatsie-poo. Sure. Thank you. The pork tastes just like beef. And the beef tastes just like pork. But why would I want to eat beef-pork and pork-beef? Why am I eating fake jelly soup and fake rainbow rice? What? You never asked so many questions before! Honestly, I don't know what I'm doing. You're pretending too much. Audiences want to see the real you. Go back to your roots. Imagine that he's your beloved. Hey, what do you mean "imagine"? He's your beloved. Look at him. You're making him something from the heart. What would you make? Poop! Let's go back to imagining. Imagine that he's your beloved. Tell me, why did you fall for him in the first place? We were fixed up! My mom catered work sites. She picked up BBQ pork from their dad every day, so we ate lunch together. And then... sigh. It was hilarious! Josephine was 15 and Lung was only 9. She fed him like he's a child groom! I didn't need to be fed! I scooped the rice myself. You met her at nine years old. So you were meant to be til death do you part and for evermore! In Eileen Chang's world, til death do us part and "for evermore" are different things. Forevermore is not bad. It's hard to be together 'til death. Life expectancy is longer now. You can live 'til you turn yellow or turn green. Live 'til you turn green? Like the Gundam robot? What would you cook for him, then? Me? BBQ pork, I guess. They grew up eating it. You're wrong there. Dad's BBQ pork tasted like crap. Those BBQ pork went to cheap diners for soup pasta, BBQ pork buns and convenience store rice boxes. They were just cheap and edible. What's wrong with that?! If Dad didn't make it, there wouldn't be cheap noodles, cheap student meals and cheap rice plates! There'd be no charity meals to give away! What they meant was that it was edible and cheap. The brothers weren't in conflict. Why did you say that in third person? You're one of us! Don't be so sensitive. Right, I was being sensitive. Maybe it's the shrimp. There's no shrimp. Yes, there is. Ha...! That was a terrible pun. How about you? Her favorite is hard to make, but I'll learn to make it for her: Fried pork intestines. How'd you know about that? Back then, when your dad was around, he'd bring it to the clinic to share it with you. He had it with mustard, but it was too spicy for you and you cried. So he comforted you with a few sips of beer. That's when you learned to drink beer. That's why you pair junk food with beer, right? I never told you that story. You did. Maybe her ex told you about it. Maybe. How long have you been together? About six months. That means you already liked her when she was with her ex? It's hard... to define "like"... Right... An ex of mine... When I was with my ex-ex-boyfriend, he would take spy photos of me and collect things of mine. When I became single again, he immediately made his move. It was so romantic! You bid the tenders for projects at work. So you knew that it was her firm's tender. You made a bid just to see her again? Meow Meow, what you don't know is that Bernard is really pragmatic-attic. When I was dumpty-dumped, I asked him if I should win my girly-friend back. He told me to give uppity-up. I had no idea that he's sentimental-lentil. It completely went over my heady-head. His baby talk sounds kinda off this time... Whether two people can stay together isn't up to other people. Maybe it's fate for you to split up. It's not batty-fatey. It was man-made-lemonade. If she's meant to be your soulmate-mate, you two wouldn't have splity-licky. What if someone intended to take my fish from my pond, slice her up, stir-fry her in a hot wok-wok and serve her up for him-selfie-elf? Actually... I've suspecting for quite a while. I hope to hear the truth from you guys. Fish is better... steamed, right? It's a waste to stir-fry it. There's no absolute in cooking. A family can set right and wrong aside, but you have to be sensible. That's not from a book. Mom said that. Cheers, Big Brother. What is being sensible? Don't eat more than you can handle. Dig in. Let's eat! Sweetheart. Did I startle you? Sorry. It's fine... I want to say... I promise you what happened tonight won't happen again. Were you in love with me all this time? Did you bid for that tender just to see me again? The truth doesn't matter. What matters is the answer that will improve our relationship. Get some sleep. Though I can't speak about the future I quietly await your return In this cold, gloomy winter... To be in your warm embrace once more... is my one and only dream Though I can't speak about the future, I quietly await your return... Though our wishes diverge as the world turns I still have some past dreams to share Everything these days suddenly seems troubled When I look back on our past... Was it love? Was it fate? Or was it pain? I still don't know the answer to this day I can't believe, I still believe that you're the best one for me You may be gone now, but my love burns on On this endless night, who has your love... The flowers won't bloom, love is vast as the ocean If you miss me, why am I in solitude? I need some water Sorry. Sorry, sorry... Ready when you are. Action! Let's out first. What's wrong? My soul drifted off. I don't think I can do this. Okay, we won't film today, then. I'll just document how you make this dish. What are you cooking today? Veggie and ham stew. It'll bloom like a flower in the end. WQW! Honey, it's time to eat... What's wrong? The leech of the photography world. Wing Shya says your green bean soup photo plagiarized him? When I plagiarized, no one was the wiser. The second I do something original, I do the same thing as a celebrity photographer. That's just eerie. Wing Shya got plagiarized! Wow, it's exactly the same! Some people are so shameless! Oh, you're the leech of the photography world? It's a misunderstanding. It's night and day, actually. This is a green bean soup. That's a red bean soup. I'm a chef, trust me. Why'd you tell me to be original? I was just fine plagiarizing! I'll sort this out for you. You think he'll be that understanding? He's a master. Remember how I told you that my ex is a photographer? Your ex is Wing Shya? How many boyfriends have you had? Eighteen. I need 18 lives to reach that number. I may not have been good at relationships, but I was serious about all of them. - You're bothered? - Let me cool off first. Hey! Cooling off is important. Hey, Wing, we have to talk. As an Eileen Chang super-fan, I wonder why someone as old-fashioned as you call up a girl to make someone jealous? That wasn't the only reason I called her up. Without her, I might lose it. OMG! You thought about stealing your brother's girl! I didn't! Besides, it's him who "coveted his neighbor's wife" first. Wait. You two live together. He's not your "neighbor". You're flatmates, if you steal her back, you're coveting your f|atmate's wife. Don't you speak English? It's from the Ten Commandments! Don't you know figures of speech? Oh, really? You really have to sort out your relationships. Hey. She cleared your name! She cleared your name! She's really serious about you. Eileen Chang said, Don't oversleep when you dream of love. If you let Ah Meow carry the role you've assigned her past Mid-Autumn Festival and through Christmas, it'll be very hard to turn back. Meow Meow. I have something to tell you. This is for you. How did you know? Your glasses are for indoors. This one lets you see the outside world more clearly. I'll put them on for you. Here. Looking good! See? Thank you so much. I've looked at your photos all my life. The best are in black-and-white. The plagiarized ones are in color. I didn't get it all this time... until I saw the brand of your sunglasses and I did some research online. I realized that they're color-blind glasses. You can't differentiate red and green. Lung said that you can't inherit the BBQ pork business. That's when I wondered if it's because your eyes can't gauge the shade of red on the pork. After your mom died, you raised your brothers on your own. Pretending that all is well must have been tough, right? In this home, the one who works the hardest to make everyone happy is the least happy, right? I couldn't even tell my ex about this. Thank you. It's been forever since anyone asked whether I'm happy. I'm sorry. You came looking for me right after you rejected me. Even a child would know that you're not serious about me. So I just came to have some fun with you. You could tell, right? Yes, I could. See? You're pretending again. I know you couldn't tell. I think that you're a good man. You're just a bit of a doofus. I'm worried that if I keep playing along, you won't be able to handle it. So I think... you should figure out what you want. Let's stop pretending. Why are you looking at old photos? Meow wants an old photo of you three brothers. I don't know why. To curse us? Definitely. The video's done. What would you do for your beloved? This girl would plant a flower for him. What time are you coming tomorrow? Where to? Aren't you coming to see my match? Oh, why would I go alone? Of course I'm going with you. We'll go at 10. All right. Mic check. Chicken Roll. COPY- - Monkey. - Copy. - Goal. - Copy. Done. The Hong Kong stop of "Winner Player One" starts in five minutes! Sit. Have you eaten? Cut the chit-chat. Get to the point. If not for the typos in those messages, would we still be together? I don't know... But there's no point in asking all those if's... And if there's a point? And if it's a "yes"? If I said "|'I| win you back" and "I won't win you back", what would you do in each case? Don't answer a question with a question. Be a man! Just tell me what you want to do I can give up everything for you. Let's be together again! I'm sorry. Hello? You're home. Right behind me again? It's pouring outside. You had an umbrella? Yeah... Let's watch Lung's match. Steve! Join us. You just left the TV on. We have a winner! It was neck and neck between Spanner and Slooberble! It was down to the wire! It was tough for both teams, but what a show for the audience! You're not sitting? I sat for too long in there, I'll stand. The winning team will receive one million dollars. Big Brother, today... It's you! You won! Winner Player One Hong Kong's winner is Slooberble! They're more amazing than the Avengers! We won! Hello? I want to thank my teammates - Okay. - And most importantly, myself! Also, thanks to my computer and the Internet! Ah Meow said that Lung wants home cooking tonight. Josephine's coming home to cook, and Lung has an announcement. Okay. I have work to do. I don't care that people don't believe in us as long as we believe in us! Thank you! Slooberble! Slooberble! Slobberble! Yes, yes yes yes. No, no no no no. Yes, yes yes. All right, great. Let's eat. Do we need to wait for Ah Meow? She said to start without her. Then let's start. My meteoric rise is starting! Don't be so cocky. Let's toast first. Cheers! Cheers! Now that you have your million, what are you going to do? What do you mean? We're a hit now. We get $1.2 million a year for sponsorship. We're the F.C. Barcelona of Hong Kong esports now! Already? Well, $1.2 million a year is only 100k per month, If we get a few more mil in investment, with our Hong Kong Champion title... Again? I'm not selling. You know that this factory building is old, my room is too cold and too hot, and the party room blasts music all day. Mom would never allow it! The home stays! The oven stays! Dad stays! I'm not selling! When did Mom say that we can't sell? She said it on her deathbed! Really? But Lung and I were there. You two were in the bathroom... together! Mom's ward only had one stall. Together? I was holding his dick? Don't pin this on Mom. I know she'd never want us to sell! HOW? I think she'll want us to sell! Perfect! Two against one. We're selling! I'm the big brother! I say we don't sell! You're moving goalposts. A big brother is like a father! Is that so? Say, Daddy, why were you in your room with your daughter-in-law? It's not what you think... It's not her fault. Of course it's not. She's my girlfriend. Don't play the hero hugging her in front of me. You already did that today! That's right, We hugged. You really did? Did you kiss? But it's complicated. Just let me explain... You kissed?! And you dare to talk about sense? That's right! We were making out! French kiss! Hey! - Yes. - I'm coveting her! Even if I am, you coveted your neighbor's wife first! Wait! You two live together. He's more like a flatmate. -So technically, -he coveted his "flatmate's" wife. It's a figure of speech! Why do you take things so literally?! It's true! When you were still together, I already liked her. If I didn't see you as a big brother, I would've just stolen her! What "see"? I AM your big brother! Bullshit! Your dad stole my mom from my dad. That's how we suddenly became stepbrothers. I'm just doing exactly what your dad did back then, Big Brother! - Let's talk privately, all right? - Let's not! He's always on about family. So let's lay it out in the open! Fine! Lay it. Okay. Lay on! You lay first. I've got nothing to lay. So you're hiding something again! I've got nothing to say! Let's start with my arm. That's my fault? It was an accident! It's common sense to load the gas lift in a gas lift bed! What's a gas lift bed? See?! No one knows. Are we really from the same father? Our genes are so different! What a waste to sacrifice my life for you two. What do you mean? You're still alive! Before we were brothers, I took my father's family name. I was Lee Shing-lai! Then I came here, took your family's shitty naming convention and I became Chan Lai! So what?! Wait! Lee Shing-lai, 37 strokes. The astrology chart says I'd be a dragon in the pond, bound to leap towards success. Chan Lai, 34 strokes. Endless disasters. Misfortunes abound. Bad news only. Change your name. I went from "successful dragon" to "misfortunes abound"! Is everything okay? We're all right. Let's eat. Let's eat. The food's gone cold. A rush of wind came through and cooled the food. Once food is on the table, no matter what your troubles are, you should set them aside and enjoy the food. That's basic respect for the chef! Ah Meow, it's just home cooking. Let's not get worked up today, okay? Think about it. The kitchen only has two stoves and an oven. Yet, all four dishes and the soup arrive hot on the table. Think of the calculations Josephine made to make that possible. And... in the five dishes, there's no overlap in the ingredients and the cooking method. It's so professional and amazing! Did your food critic ex teach you that? No. He did! It's not what you think. That wasn't what I meant. This is what I meant. Lung has an announcement to make. I winked to tell you the feng shui's off. I'm not doing it. Oh, I got it all wrong. What is that? Another cosplay costume? What is it? Why now? I have always planned to do it now. I couldn't finish an Eileen Chang novel... So I just watched the movie "Lust, Caution". This is the biggest rock I could afford. How much is it? I followed all his specifications. The color, the Hearts and Arrows and the cutting are all excellent. It's 2.1 karats. How much is it?! $261,000! I used up all my prize money for this. Thank you for being by my side all these years. It was your hard work in the kitchen that inspired me to work just as hard on the keyboard. That's how my dream came true. But I wasn't inspired. Your keyboard has never moved me. When you quit your job a few years ago to do esports, I never thought that you would succeed. When you won the tournament, I was disappointed for a second. I felt like I lost. So you won this time, then what? You'll keep winning and losing. That's not a future that I want! I did a cooking tutorial last night. I made the veggie and ham stew that blooms like a flower for you. But I didn't have the urge to show you the video at all. I realized that you don't have to exist in my world. My granny was an amah. My mother was in catering. We're used to putting effort into cooking for others. I don't want my life to end up like that. I'm sorry. Lung really loves you! You're really like Cleopatra and Antony. What did she say? I haven't understood a thing she said... Get up, don't cry. Come on... - It's okay... - I want to sell the place! Once I'm rich, we'll be together for evermore! That's not related! She said it's not related. Calm down. I want to sell the place! Sell it! We're not selling! You don't have to listen to me, but you gotta listen to him! You two share the same dad! What the hell does that mean?! We're just stepbrothers, so you don't want to share! I don't want a cent now! - So sell! - Share a father? We only have one father! And one mother! And we're three brothers! No, mama's boy! What?! My mama is your mama, too! Your mama is your mama. My mama is my mama. I called you mama's boy because your mama ain't my mama, mama's boy! - Say that again. - What, mama's boy? I'm lronman, c'mon! You're so slow It's fine. Iron this! Stop being a baby. Watch your mouth! You hit your little brother? You animal! What's going on? He hit you, see? You're crazy! A lunatic! Go away! Apologize! For what? Right now! Why? Remember the light that was in our hearts? We're three brothers. It's the theme song to "Brother Squad", our game! Growing up is complicated. My two younger sisters are in Taiwan. I only came to treasure them after I left home. I hope this video will remind you that having someone grow up with you is something truly precious. Steve! Bernard! We're brothers! Yes, we're brothers. It's okay now. It's okay now. Don't cry. I'd never hit my big brother. Don't cry. We're clean slate now. Hold the phone. My hands are busy. It's out of focus. I just grabbed it from your room. He and she shared the same dream once He and she are losing control tonight He and she are riled up by Judas The desire to share a meal ends with a brawl He tries to protect the plant with care Only for it to be ruined by lies He would rather forget his family ties Only to be hurt again in the very same place Love is the most desirable taste on Earth. Its affection is the bait Love is an evil toxin that will take you down. Can the flower in your heart blossom? Can you laugh at this joke? Can you enjoy such a dangerous kiss? Can you tell between sadness and joy? Are you okay? I'm okay, thanks. I've truly failed as a big brother. I'm done trying. I'm done... Yup. This family... ends here and now! I didn't eat, I'm hungry. Why did you come down? Some things aren't valued until they're broken. I don't want this family to end like this. The problem lies with you. I know that. Then why did you come after me? Iaheadylefl. This is not what I meant. Bernard can't live without you. To move on... We need to accept all that's happened. There's something I never told you. Something's wrong with my eyes. I can't define colors well. Since I can't see clearly, I should step forward and look closer. Make things clear. It's hard for us to make things clear. You won't be my brother-in-law. You won't be my friend. And you definitely won't be my lover. Is there a kind of relationship that can't be described with a word? Maybe that's the relationship we have. Not naming it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It'll be hard, but we have to move on together. As a family, we move on together. Get back to me soon! You were in your room? How's your arm? Did you hurt yourself? Do you need help? Close the door! Get out, then close the door! What happened? Let me help... What, your other arm's hurt, too? I have to pee! How can you help me? You're really gonna hold it? It's embarrassing! Embarrassing? I've already seen everything! You've seen it, but you've never touched it! Pee on your own, then. Let's see how you'll change those pants. I'm your big brother. Who else is gonna do it? Careful! Don't worry. Careful! I won't out you, You have underwear on. I don't! That's so unhygienic! When do you wear the ones you wash? When I see people. Which kindergarten did you go to? The same one as you. Hurry! Don't move. Hey, don't shuffle around. I have to find it! Your hand is cold. Relax... Yes... Yes... Yes... Why didn't I just pee sitting down? I'm sorry. I'm fine. All right, I'm not fine. But I'll make it fine. Next week is Mid-Autumn Festival. Remember one year, Dad got in trouble and Mom kicked him out in the morning? Then Mom called to tell him he had to be home for dinner. Mom said, Mid-Autumn dinner is the most important meal of the year. No matter what, we have to eat together. Lung has to understand that first. Text him. Tell him we're selling our home. Lie to get him home first. I don't think Mom would want that. Yu Fook? Haha... It's just broken. It's "Yau Fook". Who cares about what others see? What we see is what matters. You even brought out the holy beasts. - Is something big happening? - Yeah. Domineering, aren't they? Let's place them here for good. Good idea! What will we feed them? What do they eat? BBQ pork? Time to eat! I knew you guys lied. But Mom said Mid-Autumn dinner should be eaten as a family, so let's eat first. Are you all right? I'm fine. Hi. Hi. It's been a long time. Really? I wasn't counting... Why are you here out of the blue? The door wasn't locked, so I showed myself in. Why'd you come for me out of the blue? I'm not here for you. I'm here for Steve. What? You two...? No! He just invited me to dinner. You scared me! I thought it's another... I'm glad you're back. I haven't decided anything! Steve just invited me back to try his cooking and have a final meal here. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Josephine's back. Yau Fook's BBQ pork! What? I studied the recipe forever. It's edible. Why did she say "final meal"? You told them? Oops. I had a grand speech planned and everything and you spoiled it. You've sold the flat? I signed the contract yesterday. We'll move out after winter solstice. We're lucky that Mom and Dad blessed us with this place. So we can't get complacent. We should open our doors, step outside, walk further and achieve things! That's how we live up to our blessing! What book did you steal that from? Year of the Tiger Horoscope. Okay, let's dig in! Let's eat! Try the BBQ pork first. Come on. Sure. - Are you sure it's edible? - Let's have a bite. Be generous! -Well -You're not eating? I am now. How it tastes? It's terrible. It's freaking terrible! That's what Dad's BBQ pork... actually tasted like. You miss me? I want to know, did you want me to sell this place? What do you think? You said it yourself: The home stays, the oven stays, Dad stays. Did I say that? I guess it's because it sounded nice. It was in my head all these years, Ma! Why do people think that dead people's words are gospel? You think I'm full of wisdom? Before I married your dad, I was just a nightclub hostess! What are you trying to say?! Wherever family is... that's where home is. I think I get it. You do? But selling it then renting it back is kinda dumb. I need time! You'll waste money on rent! I'll rent half the space out! Anyway, leave when you've stayed long enough. You said it yourself: Open the doors, step outside, and go further. That's my boy. Looking for me? Are you looking for me? I left something here. Have you had dinner? Want to get beef noodles downstairs? Shall we go further? You may be gone now, but my love burns on On this endless night, who has your love... The flowers won't bloom, love is vast as the ocean If you miss me, why am I in solitude? A Sunny Chan Film Let's eat! Try the meatsie-poo, sweetheart. Cut! You're really giving him the big piece? Don't touch me! Concentrate. You hands are so cold! Okay. All right? What's Double May? I don't know, never heard of it! Why're you still rolling? Your father stole my... Told you you can't do it. Give me another chance. Do we keep eating? It's edible. Look at Lung! Try it. Bernard! Bernard! You guys eat, I got a stomachache. Get set, go! Keep it high! Higher! Need a pair of chopsticks to hold it? Why not hold it with a fork? Three words, Lee Shing-lai. ♪ $%"&♪( You guys are like @$♪%& ♪ I really didn't get her this time. Steve, do you sense that someone is watching us eat?
