* (exuberant orchestral music) (exuberant orchestral music) - by the year 1869, the map of the united states was nearly complete. Trappers, explorers, and government survey parties had scouted practically every corner of the continent. Yet even as late as '69 there remained one major area that was unknown and uncharted. This was the territory through which the Colorado river made its way. 1,000 miles of trackless wasteland. Here was mystery, beckoning the adventurous, calling to the bold in spirit. The man who answered the challenge was john wesley powell, scientist, one-time schoolteacher, and former officer in the union army. Major powell was determined to risk the rapids that were said to lie in wait in these deep gorges, and he found nine other hearty souls willing to run them with him. And so our story is a tale of ten men, ten who dared the unknown. It's an authentic account taken from the major's own records and told now in his own words. - I decided to embark at a point near green river city, Wyoming. Accordingly I fitted out four sturdy boats. With the help of some like-minded companions I loaded these with provisions and equipment, enough to last for several months. On the day of our departure, the good people of the town turned out to see us off. Motivated more, I'm sure, by curiosity than by any conviction that we might succeed. - are you major powell? - that's right. Mcspadden of the cheyenne leader. Now major, would you mind telling me why you think you can lick this river when nobody else has? - well, I'm a geologist, Mr. Mcspadden. I believe in science. And I've made careful calculations. - what's the chair for, major? - that's my look-out station. I can direct the boats with signal flags from there. Now if you'll excuse me, I said we'd start at 1:00 sharp. - well, you can't just up and leave like that. I ain't even got the names of your men. - ask them. Ready, men? - you in the bow! Who are you? - jack sumner. Chief sportsman. - who's the man in the back? - tell the man your name, william. - bill dunn. - are you a geologist? - nope. - then why are you going? - 'cause I can get away from people. - hey, you in the bow of the kitty clyde's sister, what's your name? - he's captain walter powell. - any relation to the major? - brother. - what's your handle? - george bradley. - hey, maid of the canyon, will you give me your monikers? - I'm oramel howland. - how do you spell "oramel"? - ask any of the boys on the rocky mountain news. I'm a newspaper man too. This is my brother seneca howland. We hail from Vermont. And that's andrew hall. - I bet you "dinnah ken" Where I come from. - hey, no-name, you run out of names? - yep. - well, what's yours? - I've run out too. - ain't you got a "name de plume"? - you just say Missouri went along to do the cookin'. - put me down as frank goodman, old boy. - are you an englishman? - naturally. - why are you making this trip? - oh, to carve one's name in the temple of fame. That sort of thing, you know. - there's ten other names you should've had. - who? - next of kin. - at last our expedition was afloat. For these first few days we would have smooth water and easy running, and a chance to master the techniques of river travel. The problems that had plagued our departure were behind us. Ahead lay the challenge. The only difficulty now was the river, and this I was confident we could conquer. - sure is mighty fine-looking country. Say, walter, this is fine-looking country. - I'll bring you more tonight. - you mad, boy? You can't have a dog along. - he's only a wee tyke. - well, the major won't let you keep him. - you'll no tell him. - no, but he'll hear barking. - jarvie doesn't bark. - let's have a look at him. - jarvie, huh? He ain't much of a purebred, is he? - he's a purebred american. (both laugh) - put that stuff away. - oh, now don't get goody-goody with me, Mr. Billy hawkins. - my name's Missouri. - well, I must have mistakened you for a certain billy hawkins from creed. I--i heard he'd do anything to get a drink. Anything. - my name is Missouri, and don't you forget it. - don't give it another thought, dear boy. (chuckles) You know, hawk-- uh, Missouri, the major planned everything about this expedition down to a gnat's heel, as you fellows would say. But why he picked some of us, including your obedient servant, I will never know. - we were all he could get. - what're you doing with that contraption, major? - I'm shooting a star, seneca. I can establish our position with this sextant here. You see, I take a meridian observation, then I check to see whether it-- my dead reckoning plot agrees with this astronomic determination. - well, I'll be dipped. I'm a student of the stars myself, major. - oh? - sure. See there? Raphael's prophetic messenger for 1869-- "man's fortune foretold by the influence of the stars." Say, uh... Tsst. What's that-- what's that word right there by my thumb? - propitious. The moon is in propitious aspect with mars. - now does that mean she's good or bad? - that means she's good. - ahh, well, I'd say we got a good week ahead of us, then. Oh, but you got to look out for the tenth, major. - oh? - yes, sir. On the tenth, satan is gonna be in the square of sagittarius. - thank you, Mr. Dunn. We'll watch out for the tenth. - you best, 'cause you're gonna be treading on dangerous ground. (bird chirps) Oh, and ain't that pretty? (bird chirping) - ah... There's a pleasure in the pathless woods. There is rapture on the lonely shore. - there's wood to be brung in if you want me to keep the coffee hot. - I go, my lord. There is society where none intrudes. By the deep sea, and music in its roar. I love not man the less, but nature more. - ain't there no way to bring him back down to earth again? He's in your boat, ain't he? Can't you do nothing? - well, maybe I could drown him. - maybe we could drown him out. How 'bout a song, walter? Aw, come on, now. When you've been blessed with a fine voice, you ought to use it. - how 'bout that old tune, ten jolly rovers there, seneca? (all agree) - (strums guitar) - * Oh * We Are Ten Jolly Rovers all: * ROVERS, ROVERS - * But Willy Peck, He broke his neck * * And Now We're Rovers nine * all: * NINE, AND NOW We're rovers nine, yo! * - * We Are Nine Jolly rovers * all: * ROVERS, ROVERS - * But Tim Mcgee Drew a gun on me * * And Now We're Only eight * all: * EIGHT, AND NOW We're rovers eight, yo! * - * We Are Eight Jolly rovers * all: * ROVERS, ROVERS - * But Jim Betrayed An indian maid * * And Now We're Rovers seven * all: * SEVEN, AND NOW We're rover's seven * - hee hee hee! - * We're Seven Jolly Rovers all: * ROVERS, ROVERS - * But Andy Hall Was too darn small * * And Now We're only six * all: * SIX, AND NOW We're rovers six, yo! * - rovers, eh? Ah... Maybe you recall the immortal words of lord byron. We'll go no more a-roving so late into the night... (others groan and yawn) Though the heart be still as loving and the moon be still as bright. - that does it. - though the night was made for loving, and the day returns too soon. (clattering pots and pans) We'll go no more a-roving by the light of the moon. - good night, goodman. - saw the dog. You know the rules. Take him out and get rid of him. Come on. - major, sir, we-- - I told you to get rid of him. What're you waiting for? - he eats very dainty, sir. Very dainty. We can get along fine on just my share. - it isn't the food, andy. But when we're running rapids, a dog could become a serious problem. I'm sorry. - I was wondering when you were gonna open your mouth. You'd have been better off keeping it shut. - why, you big galoot... - never mind, walter. - what do you mean, "never mind"? Said you wanted a good right arm. If you can't enforce your rules, I will. - now, you let me try him, major, and I'll find out what kind of right arm you got there. - there'll be no fighting, Mr. Dunn. - oh. All right. - he's had time enough. - no, walter. I made the rules. - I'm the one to blame, jarvie. I am, surely. You know I can't turn you loose for the wolves to eat. And you might drown like a kitten in the burn. You can see for yourself it-- it would be better to die by the hand of someone who loves you. Turn your wee face away. - andy. I'm sorry, andy. I'm truly sorry. Give me that. (un-cocks gun) You go back to camp. Go on. (cocks gun) - (whimpers) - now... None of that, now. - (whimpers, barks) - I hadn't met you when I made that rule. Just got to find something for you to do, that's all. Come on. (adventurous music) * I had warned the men that we'd eventually come to rapids. And at the first fast water, I was pleased to see them share my own excitement. We continued to make good progress, on some days traveling as much as 60 miles. Our stops were chosen with an eye to a good campsite. But sometimes the men picked a spot as a likely-looking place to pan for gold. - what's wrong, oramel, you too lazy to get rich? - I wouldn't waste my time around here. Wait till we get down to little Colorado. You'll see me picking up nuggets the size of your thumb. - how you know? - newspaper man hears things. - (chuckles) - who said you could use my basin? - I'm sorry, walter, I didn't think you cared. - from now on, keep your filthy hands off my things. - crazier than a loon. What'd the major bring him along for, anyhow? - I don't know. I reckon to straighten him out. - he messes with me, I'll flatten him out. - I'll tell you something about walter. Was in the army. My old artillery gun mate. Was all right as long as he was fighting. Then he got himself captured and thrown into... Andersonville. He broke out once. Was hiding in the malarial swamp for days. When they recaptured him there he was just raving. It all made him pretty savage. - yeah, I reckon being a prisoner of war ain't much sweetening for a man's nature. I have no hard feelings, sir. - yah! Biscuits is made! Come on! - come on, walter, it's time for bacon and coosh. - bacon and coosh? - yeah, let's eat. - * John Brown's Body Lies A moldering in the grave * * John Brown's Body Lies A moldering in the grave * * John Brown's Body Lies A moldering in the grave * * His Soul Goes marching on * Hey bradley, how do those words go about hanging jeff davis? - I don't remember. - you were in the army, weren't you? - yep. - why don't you know those words? - why don't you know 'em? - I do. Every northern soldier knows 'em. But I never heard a northern soldier call flour gravy "coosh." I heard lots of southerns say that, though, when I was a prisoner. You wouldn't be a johnny red, would ya? - the war's over, walter. - it is for some. I guess all of these boats have got their own little secret. But I like ours the best. (ominous music) * - you sure you won't change your mind? - told you to keep that out of my sight. - of course, dear boy. Though you'll permit me to say so, the river seems an odd sort of place to take the cure. Now, wouldn't it be more logical to drink whilst you're here with friends, and refrain from drinking at creed, shall we say? (chuckles) I tell you what we'll do. You keep the paddles chugging and I'll stoke the boiler. - how 'bout a little drink for tonight? - of course, dear boy. Good for a scorpion bite. (rushing water) - hand me my flag, will you, Mr. Dunn? - yes. - rapids ahead! - let me have some of that. - you've got a flask in your pocket. - that's for tonight. Let me have a drink of that. - you've had enough already. - I said I want a drink. (suspenseful music) * - hey, goodman! Missouri! Come on back to shore! They'll smash on the rocks. Come on. * - listen, you drunken fool, get back to your oars! I've already-- look out! Look out! * - thank you, Mr. Sumner. Nice bit of boating. Why didn't you follow my signals? - we didn't see 'em. - you didn't see them? - I was having a drink of whiskey. - whiskey? Your whiskey just cost us a boat. All right. We're ten men and only three boats now. Another 800 miles to go. And about 1/4 of our provision is gone. What do you think, men? Are we good for it? - why, of course, major. - yes, sir. - fine. I'll take some measurements now. Bring me my instruments, will you, Mr. Bradley? - I'm sorry, major, I'm afraid I put them in the no-name this morning. - why, you stupid, dim-witted-- - here, here, come on, walter. - major, the boat broke right in two, and both ends were water-tight. If we look along the bank there a little ways, we might find it. Isn't that right, oramel? - well, we could take a look. - well, let's go. - all right, let's go back and lie down the boats. - aw, shucks, major. We can run that rapids. I did it alone. With bill's help here, we can make her, easy. - how 'bout it, Mr. Dunn? - well, sir, them are your boats and you own 'em, but I feel it's my duty to warn you again that today is the tenth. It says, "take no risks whilst the lunar aspects are bad." There she is, right there in black and white. - let's defy your stars, Mr. Dunn. We're grown men. We make our own good luck. - (clears throat) Just a minute now, major. Work out something here... If we was to wait till "piscus" was in its "descendency," Be along about day after tomorrow. - hey! Hey, I found 'em! There you are, major. It's all I could find. - thank you, seneca. Put 'em over here, hmm? - oh, for instance, uh, now, as-- like, right now, "aquias" is in "descendency." That means this is a good time for unforeseen, un-foretold events. - well, what does all that mean? - well, it means, like, a surprise. - oh. - (cheers) Yoo! Look, a half a keg. Let's have a drip of wine. Ha ha. - sarge is never wrong. (men laughing, babbling) - pass it over here. Hey, bill, you're drinking all that liquor. - get it off him, george, pass it over here. - pass it over. - give me that. - oh, no. - give that to me. - now see here, major, we're with you all the way, but the boys ain't in uniform anymore. (laughs) And I never was. And you would find it don't do to come between the types slinging this whiskey, so if you'll just turn your back we'll dispose of that jug in no time at all. - let me have it. (laughing) Give me that. (men taunting) - hey, give me that! - no! No! - come on! - wait! - ahh! - he's crazy! - no! - no! No! You're gonna sink it! - just like potting johnny reds, eh, george? The loss of the no-name was bad enough. And now another difficulty seemed to be developing. I could see that bradley and walter weren't hitting it off too well. And this disturbed me because I knew that bad blood in the party could only bring trouble. I'm afraid, however, that I let my mind be distracted from these personal matters by the sheer magnificence of the changing panorama. Around every bend of the river there seemed to be some new surprise. One night, directly opposite our camp, we discovered a canyon wall with remarkable acoustics. We named it echo cliff. - yahoo! (echoes) (dog barks) (echoes) - (plays guitar) (echoes) - my name's howland! (echoes) What's yours? (echoes) - (chuckles) Jack sumner, what's yours? (echoes) - my name's hawk-- my name's Missouri, what's yours? - jim baker! (echoes) - hey. (laughing) - why, it is jim baker! Baker! Well. - hi, jim. - john. - what brought you down here? - well, me and my woman stayed the winter. Right now I'm on my way to the ute indian agency to pick up some horses to get my pelts out of here. - oh... - you all better come along with me. Might be your last chance to walk out of here alive. - you know, major, since the last time I run acrosst you scouting out them canyons last winter, I been asking some questions about that river too. - oh? - I been picking up all the information I can from the indians, and they know just about everything there is to know about that river, and they say it can't be run. - why not? - well, as far as I can gather, way down below there there's a big falls. Bigger than niagara. A real sharp gully going right between the cliffs. So a man can't turn around when he gets down there and he can't climb out. - I doubt that, jim. There shouldn't be any niagara in a heavily silted river. It's against science. - maybe. - they tell you where this here niagara is at? - no, they don't even like to talk about it. That river's bad medicine to the indians. But my woman can tell you about it. (speaks Ute) - (speaks Ute) - she says a long time ago there was an indian chief. Had a wife named "numa." - (speaks Ute) - and when she died, this chief mourned and grieved so much that the god "tawods" Took him to see her way off down yonder in a beautiful garden paradise. - (speaks Ute) - so when this chief saw that his wife was happy in this paradise, the god tawods led him back home, but he told him that he couldn't tell what he'd seen. So just to make sure, the god tawods filled his trail with a roaring, raging river so that no man could ever find the end of that trail. And she says no man ever has. - thank you. That's a very beautiful legend. - it's more than just pretty, major. - you don't believe it, do you? - no, I don't believe that paradise garden part. But there's bound to be a little bit of truth in it somewheres down the line. Do you think if any of them shoshones ever try going down that river it's probably the bad medicine? - not to my recollection. - mind if I asked her? - no, go right ahead. - (speaks Ute) - aha. (speaks Ute) - yeah, she said some of them try, but they never come back up again. - reckon you'll change your mind, major? - well, I won't. As for the others, it's up to them. - major, it, uh, might be just as well if I walked out. - no. I will. Missouri didn't bring that whiskey. I did. I took advantage of him. - well, now that you've told me the truth, Mr. Goodman, I'd be sorry to lose you. - come on, goodman, stay with us. - thank you, sir. - don't go. - you don't have to go. - and you chaps. But I've seen danger enough already. I'm walking out with baker in the morning. - well, now, I didn't mean to break up your party. I want you all to give it up. - oh, don't you worry. You believe my mind. If the river is bad medicine, at least we won't have to worry about any unfriendly indians, will we? Now what do you think, men? Are you with me? - yeah. - we sure are. - with you, major. - sure. - we're with you, major. - so the die was cast. There was no turning back. Secretly, though, I was worried. One boat was gone, the other three overloaded. Only the thickness of their planking stood between us and death. But what concerned me most was water. Though we lived with death constantly, an even greater threat to our safety existed in the unpredictable person of my own brother. - Missouri, you were in the army. Ever hear one of those southerns brag that one red could lick ten yankees? - walter, I'm sick of your harping about the war. The war. If you've got so much breath to waste, grab an oar. - give me orders, you drunken jailbird. - hey, watch it there. Pulling into shore. - better watch out for those rocks, Mr. Dunn. - look out for the rock bed. All right. Ease him up. Go ahead. Careful, Mr. Sumner. There we go. - hey, you got yourself quite a dunking. - yeah, that wasn't enough, either. I had to go and lose my watch too. - oh, I'm sorry about that, bill. - so am I. Cost me a dollar six bits. - (chuckles) - well, even if you don't find it, it's not a total loss. - how's that? - you got a bath, didn't you? That's the only way you'd ever take one. - what? (yells) (growls) I've got ya. Now get under there and stay. Get back down there and stay there. That's right, swallow a lot of that good old muddy water. It's good for ya! Get back down under there. (men shouting) - let him loose, bill, you'll drown him. - that's just what I had in mind. - ah! - all right, fine, get him out of here. Go on. Clean now? - now just a minute, walter. We've all took a lot off of you on account of the major. But we're not taking any more. - you dirty reb, I'll-- - now, just a minute. - who's a dirty reb? - no, bill, this is my fight. I'm the one he's got it in for. We might as well get this thing over with right now. - all right. Go on. - come on. - aw, watch it, george! Get your dukes up, boy! Ahh... (laughs) - (laughs) How 'bout that? - attaboy, george! Knock him into the middle of next week! (laughs) - hey, enough of that. Let's keep this thing sociable here. - attaboy, baby! - nice going, george! Well, now, that's more like it. That's what I call a fight. - yeah, baby! (laughs) - look out for the oar! - low bridge! Man overboard! (laughs) Oh, that's a beaut, george! (chuckles) Now you got him where you want him. Now put him down under there and sit on him! Now, don't let him up for air! Drown him again! - come on, george, get up! Attaboy! Come on, now! - whup him, boy, he can't lick us. Oh, that's the way, now hit him again! - yah! - (laughs) - how 'bout that? - ah, there's nothing like a good, clean fight. Always entertaining. (laughs) - Mr. Dunn. - hmm? - stop them! - what for? Two's company. - walter! - now, three ain't even necessary at all, major, leave them alone, now. - I do not want it! Walter! - it's none of your business, you cripple, you! - I was sick at heart for poor walter. Though I tried not to show it. The men too went about their business as though nothing had happened. Walter continued to sulk. My apology hadn't seemed to help any. I had hoped so much to see this trip bring him out of his shell. But in spite of everything, he seemed to persist in his antagonistic attitude toward the world in general, and george bradley in particular. Huh. Walter, the old maps don't show the junction of the grand and green rivers within 100 miles of this spot. And yet we're right here. I'll have to-- - it's like I always said. The war's over. - what's wrong with the major? - he's worrying about bradley and walter. - oh, they'll show up. - come on, major, you're not eating your share. - hello! - that was walter. - no, sounded more like bradley. - how 'bout some of them vittles? - we waited for you. - (chuckles) - biscuit? - yeah. - ready? - well, here we are with good food and a good fire. Doesn't that call for a song, seneca? - sure, major. What'll ya have? - home, sweet home. - how 'bout jeanie with the... - light brown hair. - yeah. - sourdough mountain. - george, what's your favorite? - I like roll along. - roll along? - yeah, it's an old southern tune. - I don't reckon any of these yankees would know it. - I know it, walter. (plays guitar) - * Roll Along * Oh, Lonely Water * Many Sons * And Many Daughters * Hear Our Mother * Softly Calling * Roll Along * Unto The Sea * Roll Along * In Wayward Laughter * Restless Then * Forever After both: * HEAR OUR MOTHER * Softly Calling * Roll Along * Unto The Sea * You And The River * The River And Me * Lonely And Homeless * Rolling On Toward the sea * * Roll Along * My Lonely Brother * Take My Hand - (humming) both: * I NEED NO OTHER * Hear Our Mother * Softly Calling * Roll Along * Unto The Sea - what a relief it was to know that my brother had finally come to his senses. Now I could turn my thoughts again to scientific investigation. When we reached the junction of the little Colorado, oramel howland joined the others in the search for gold. This was the place where the nuggets were to be as big as his thumb. - well, this here's your little Colorado, oramel. Where's them big gold nuggets you was talking about? - yeah, we ain't licked yet. Boys, what did the major do when we first started out? In an exploring line, I mean. - well, we measured the depths of these canyons. - yeah, they charted this river too. - yeah, but what's he been doing lately? - same thing. - yeah. - then why does he carry a bag and a pick? - yeah. - and he used to take andy and seneca with him. But now he always takes walter. He's keeping it in the family. (dramatic music) * - look at that, walter, just look at that. Will ya? - well, hello, gentlemen. - major. Are you gonna share? - share what? - I never heard of a geologist who wasn't hooked up to a mining concern somewhere. I got an idea you haven't been studying them rocks for the fun of it. - no, not just for the fun of it. Although there is a world of enjoyment in it. I'll try to explain it to you. - well... (clears throat) We'd, uh, like to have a look at what you got in that bag there. - well, wouldn't it be a little more friendly if I did the explaining first? - well, we'd just as soon look first. - I give you my word. There's no gold in that bag. - how come you don't just open it up, then, major? - you think I'd lie to you? - oh... - if it served your purpose. - the rest of you share that opinion? - well, now, we could take your word, major, but we'd always be wondering why you didn't open up that bag and settle the matter. - yes. - all right. I've been doing nothing more than collecting fossils. Crinoids, trilobites, brachiopods. - oh. - for a museum. Walter, give me that last one. Now, look. This is a trilobite. It's the fossilized remains of a prehistoric kind of fish. - (sniffs) - this--this is from the paleozoic era. And finding it here means that this-- this place we're standing right now was once covered by a shallow inland sea. When you see the rest of my treasures, you'll understand why I can't be bothered hunting for gold. Walter, spread 'em all out so they can see them on the ground, huh? - oh, I don't think that'll be necessary. Will it, oramel? Looks like the joke's on you, oramel. - well, what about you, sumner, did you come out here to look for fossils? - you coming, wes? - in a little while. - all right. - well, here-- here's your thing. Say, major. - hmm? - any reason why the rest of us can't go looking for them... Trail-o-whatchamacallits too? - well, no, not if you know what to look for. Would you like to learn? - well, sir, that depends. How much you get for one of them things on the old market? - oh, they're much too precious to sell, Mr. Dunn. You give 'em away to a museum. - I would? - sure. To help pay your debt to mankind. - I ain't got no debt to mankind. I don't owe nobody nothing. - well, even so, over here there's a place-- (rattlesnake rattles) - look out, there! - (rattling) - look at that, ain't he a beauty? - (rattling) (rattling intensifies) - you're a beautiful thing. - watch out! - you sassy, beady-eyed old devil. You'd like to take one little step further, wouldn't you? (spits) Go on! (giggles) - stop that, dunn. You hear me? - whoo! (laughs maniacally) - stop it! Stop that, dunn! You hear me? - (hollering) - don't you ever do that again. - you wouldn't-- you wouldn't interfere with man's little pleasures, would ya? - I would if it means risking your life. - well, now, it's my life, major. - eight other men have a stake in that life, and you have the same stake in theirs. I've been counting on you, Mr. Dunn. You take care of yourself. The day we entered the granite gorge, I felt a tremendous sense of excitement. It was as though we had reached the bottom of the world. Here was the archean rock, the oldest on the planet. Antedating even life itself. Here was the whole pageant of the earth's creation, spread out before my eyes. My companions didn't share my enthusiasm. In fact, it came as something of a shock to me to discover that jim baker's wild tales had had their effect. Now the men were visibly fearful of an unknown and terrible niagara lying somewhere ahead, waiting for us... Between these sheer canyon walls. - just in time for the beans, bradley. - took you long enough, andy. - let's get 'em going here. - get some plates out here. - get some plates out there, will you, walter? - (rattles) - well, good morning, thorn tail. Ah... Ain't you a pretty thing? (spits) Now let's see how fast you are. Yeah, come on. (giggles) - (rattling) - old scary eyes. (spits) (laughs) Can't close your lips, can you? Look out, now. Here I come. (cackling) - soggy, sour bread. Bitter coffee. I'd rather starve. - you will. I opened the last sack of flour this morning. - what? - hey! (yells) - what's the matter, dunn? - rattler. - give me your knife. - heat that up red-hot. Flame her out. - (spits) - (playing guitar and humming) * - (coughs) * (thunderclap) - water. (spits) Ah... Well, go on. Spit it out. - all right. Were you taking chances again, tormenting the snake like that other time? - yup, and I'll do it again. - Mr. Dunn, I thought I told you I was-- - I'm tired of being told what to do, major. Oramel. Give me some water. - Mr. Sumner, we may have to stay here for several days. - yes, sir. - a sick man is a double liability in the boats. - liability. What do you think you are? (coughs) (thunderclap) (rain pouring) - in a couple of days, the weather cleared. Bill dunn was his old self and able to pull an oar again, and our journey was resumed. Now we found ourselves entering a world that was both grim and beautiful. The cliffs towered above us for thousands of feet. At one point we passed a wall of crystallized lava-- striking evidence that rivers of molten rock had once poured into this gorge. And farther along, the landscape was carved even more magnificently by eons of geologic change. Fantastic erosion. Pull into shore, Mr. Sumner, I have to have a closer look. - something's got to be done about these stops. - look, oramel, it's too bad you didn't find any gold, but the major told us all when we started out on this trip it was being made for the purposes of scientific exploration. - no more stops. - trying to be leader, oramel? - all I say is no more stops. How much more flour is there? - not much. - how much? - maybe enough for this noon. - what? - I couldn't reach those formations, but I got a good look ahead, and if we pull in about a mile farther down I think I can climb up to them through a side canyon. - no more stops. - there's only enough food left for one more meal, wes. - well, then we'll fish. - we ain't caught one of them droopy-snooted mud suckers in two weeks. - shove off, Mr. Dunn. - just a minute. We want a few things understood. - I think it's about time you got a few things understood too, Mr. Howland. We are going to accomplish what we set out to do. And after this I'll stop only long enough to get the latitude and longitude of any river that's not already known. Shove off, Mr. Dunn. I felt badly about having lost my temper. In my heart I couldn't blame the men. We were all beginning to feel the strain. I had every intention of pushing on, but we'd hardly gotten started again when we sighted a fearful, great rapids. Was this jim baker's niagara? Its narrow channel seemed hardly wide enough for our boats, but its angry roar grew in volume as we approached. - thunder a-ragin'. Ain't he gonna stop? - I thought you didn't want him to. - well, we ought to scout them rapids. - he's turning in. - what I want to know is how much more of this have we got to take? - well, I haven't plotted our position in the last day or so, but we're roughly right here. Now here's the town of St. George. That's known to be 58 miles from where we should come out. So I estimate-- I'm guessing, roughly-- about another 40 miles of river. - 40 miles? Rapids maybe all the way. - no, no, I can't conceive of another 40 miles of continuous fast water. - well, we gonna run it now or eat first? - we got enough for one more batch of biscuits and that's all. - all right, let's eat 'em. My belly can't hold out no longer. - all right, Missouri, then get 'em ready. - yes, sir. (dramatic music) * - wes. Where you going? - I'm gonna have a closer look at those formations. - another side trip? - I'll be back in less than an hour. - that'll be 1:00. Bear with me. We're leaving at 1:00. (majestic, sweeping music) * - now here was something for my journal. But how could any man describe these works of titanic art? The giant hand that carved these monuments from solid rock used only the wind, and sand, and the raindrops of unreckoned ages. (suspenseful music) * Walter! Help! - (whimpering) (barks) (barking) (whimpering) - don't think something could've happened to the major, do you? - help! - hold on, wes, I'm coming! - walter! Hurry it up! - go back and get some help. - hurry! Walter! - well, it's 1:00. - eat your biscuit. He'll be along. - he's incompetent, and he's insane. - oramel! Sumner! Dunn! Get some rope, quick, the major's in trouble. - what is it, andy? - he must've slipped off the edge of a cliff. He's hanging by his one hand. - let's go. - help! Oh... - wait a minute. All right, I got ya. All right, turn loose. Just turn loose. - here I come. Oh...thank you, walter. - all right, wes? - yeah. - there they are! - where? - let down the rope. - get the rope down. Careful now. (men chattering) - all right. Take it away. - easy. Careful, now. Careful there. Easy. (men chattering) - thank you, men. All of you. But I'm sorry I was the cause of this delay. - you needn't be, major. We can thank you for showing us the way out of here. We can climb out of here. You know that, Missouri? - well, I don't know. I'd just as soon drown as roast up there. - you don't have to. I have it on good authority that the town of St. George is within walking distance. - hmm. He's right. Oramel's right. - come on, men. Let's pack our duffel and get out of here. What do you say? - I'm with you, I'm with you. Let's eat them biscuits first. - jarvie! - grr, you... (growls) Eat that! - bill, you know the desert. How long would it take us to go, say, 50 or 60 miles? - days, maybe. - and another day to climb out of here. - you've had your chance, major. It all boils down to this-- there's food up there even if it's nothing more than a prairie dog, but not down there. Maybe we can ride out the rapids. But if we hit any snag on that river, even a few more days of falls and rapids with nothing to eat and we'd all be too weak to climb out. - now, look, Mr. Howland. Travelers seldom die of starvation in this country, but they do die of thirst. The desert is an unknown quantity, but the river isn't. Let me take our bearings tonight and I'll tell you in the morning truthfully whether St. George or the river will be shorter. - I'm hungry enough to eat a rat. I had some dog, once, with indians. It wasn't bad, either. Dog's life ain't near as important as a man's. (sighs) - better get some sleep too, wes. - hunger was our problem now. I knew we had to get through. And soon. I worked at my maps most of the night. I had promised the men an honest answer, and I wanted it to be an accurate one. I was sure they'd listen to reason. But only if my calculations could be made completely convincing. Walter. Walter. Hey. - hmm? - walter. I got it all figured out. I have the facts now. It's 75 miles to St. George. - that far, huh? - yeah, but it's only 28 miles to the grand wash. In a straight line, that is. And even adding 1/3 for the bends in the river we've still got only a little under 40 miles to go. 40. That's against 75. Only thing is... In the morning I'll have to... In the morning, help me persuade the men, will you, walter? They respect you now. But they--they doubt me. They don't seem to understand the importance of what we're doing. - just want to stay alive, that's all. - I'll bring them through. - they think you're mad. - you sound as though you thought so too. Huh? Do you? - I was mad. There's no reason you can't be. Wes. I think you're gonna have to ask yourself a question. - what's that? - just how much are you thinking about the lives of these men here? Or is it that you'd rather die and let them die with you than climb out of here to safety and admit that there's some part of this canyon you couldn't whip? - good morning, gentlemen. - major. - did walter tell you about what I found out last night? - yes, he did, but we're gonna go anyway. - what? - it's no use to argue with them, wes, they've made up their minds. - right. - why, you stubborn, mule-headed fools. You want to get yourselves killed? Who's gonna chart your course for you? Dunn with that almanac of his? You must be out of your minds. - well, now, you don't suppose we're gonna leave you here to die all by yourself, do you, major? Now you best get your compass and your sextant 'cause you're coming with us. - now just a minute, Mr. Dunn. And your canteen, your rifle, plenty of ammunition. - wes! - I'm with the major too. - hey! - come on, george! - hey, we're shoving off! - wait a minute, george. - give me a hand, Missouri. - come on, grab an oar. - jarvie. Jarvie! (whistles) - (barks) - please, bill, let him down! Let him go! - (whimpering) - please, bill, let him go! Come here, jarvie. Come here. Come on, laddie. Keep swimming. Come here, jarvie. Come here, jarvie, come on. men: COME ON, JARVIE. Hey! - god bless you, bill dunn! - come on, boys. Man that other boat and come along! So we parted, separated at last by fear of the unknown. I was sorry to leave these men. They were good companions, and they'd gone through a lot for my sake. My way or theirs, either one was a gamble. At this moment only the fates could decide who was to reach civilization and ultimate safety. - that's quite enough of that. - he said we couldn't do it. - I guess that'll show the major. - (coughs) Let's get going. - I believe we're headed too far west for St. George. - well, once we get up on top of that butte we'll be able to see it, most likely. - well, the major would've headed direct over land. - hey, quit your bellyaching, seneca. - well, what do the stars say, william? - (clears throat) It says, "make the most of new opportunities. "Good luck will attend the traveler to far-distant places, "but keep thy council and do not-- do not discuss thy affairs with strangers." Now, couldn't be much plainer than that, could it? I've been studying the stars for a good many years. I never have seen such good omens. We ought to start making tracks. - what are they? Navajos? - no, them are utes. - friendly? - just a hunting party. They ain't gonna give us no trouble. - hey, uh... (clears throat) Peace to my brothers from the setting sun and, uh, the great chief of the utes. - hey, what're you doing? - will you shut up, oramel? - thought you said they was friendly. - uh, listen, now, we're friends. (speaks Ute) - (speaks Ute) - oh, no, you got that all wrong, chief. We ain't the men. - what are they saying? - would you shut up and quit acting scared? Make you look guilty, now. - guilty of what? - some white men killed one of their women and they think it was us that done it. - you know we didn't. Tell him, tell him. - I know we didn't, and I'm gonna tell him if you give me a chance, will ya? (speaks Ute) - (speaks Ute) - oh... (speaks Ute) - (speaks Ute) - wouldn't go so far as to say that. - (speaks Ute) - what's he saying? - they don't believe we come up out of that canyon. - well, threaten them with the cavalry. - tell 'em we're on government business. - would you shut up? (clears throat) (speaks Ute) ...Fort defiance. - (speaks Ute) - (speaks Ute) - (speaks Ute) - down. Point it down. (speaks Ute) There. Get out of here. Ain't nobody following us. Well, you handled that pretty slick. - well, you think that old major would've been proud of me? - I know one thing the major would've been proud of. You defied your stars. - how's that? - discussing your affairs with strangers. - oh, gosh, I did, too. - rapids ahead. It can't be much further. This one just has to be the last one. Rapids ahead! (thrilling music) * Look, gentlemen! We're through! (victorious music) * - pretty good looking old world, george. - I forgot how big it is. - that's not a bad thing to remember. - so ended one of the great sagas of the west. The Colorado, conquered. Erected by the congress of the united states to major john wesley powell, first explorer of the grand canyon, who descended the river with his party in rowboats, traversing the gorge beneath this point, august 17th, 1869. It wasn't until a year later that the fate of bill dunn and the two howlands was known. Theirs was a bitter end-- treachery, ambush, and death under a shower of indian arrows. Yet they too had been part of the great adventure.
