THE PAYOFF I knew it! I knew it! I was sure you would be sleeping. You stinking bastard! Scoundrel! We had a date this morning at nine, why didn't you come? - I didn't go? - Of course you didn't go! There must be a reason. Can you tell me what that reason is? I can't remember it right now. Luisella, you don't bother me so early in the morning. Listen to me, asshole. I forged those paper to get you the appointment with La Rinascente... - And you don't show up? - The appointment wasn't today. - You said Wednesday. - I never said Wednesday. - Yes, you told me Wednesday. - No, I said "around Wednesday". You're a liar! I had to tell you the truth for them to believe you, life would be hell. Let's see, Sas?, do you want the job? Yes or no? I'm a business consultant. Almost a lawyer. - No, you call yourself a lawyer. - Yes, ma'am. And you are not a commercial consultant, Sas?. - Am I missing something? - Everything! You only think about appearance. Clothes, image... Its important for my work. What work? You never do anything. No, that's not true. I work when I feel like it. And since I hardly ever feel like working, I work very little. But that's enough for me. And what about me? I'm young. What can I hope to become by your side? Nothing. Just know that I love you and wait until the situation improves. Why don't you take the job? Its a permanent position, a steady job! There's only one thing that's for sure. That I'm not going to La Rianascente. A permanent position will be given to me by Our Lord when I die. And that's just because I can't refuse. Then you can do whatever you want... because I'm leaving. I've been working my ass off since I meet you. You've been lying to me for fifteen years. Let's get married, let's not get married... Let's get married in the town hall... In church.... Why get married? It's not fashionable. I'm done! Now its me that doesn't want to get married. You don't need me. You need a babysitter. Who do you think I am? A social worker? Well I'm not! No! I won't keep wasting my life to turn you into a normal person. I can't take it any more! One last time, Sas?, are you coming to see Mr. Gabellone? No? Then you won't see me again! Luisa, why do you have to wake me up with this drama every morning? Don't you see I get very stressed and then my ulcer hurts? - And it hurts all day now. - You're a shameless asshole! You don't know what I had to do with Mr Gabellone to get you that appointment. - You don't know! - Why did you have to do?! Taken. Ah, its you lawyer! Here, here. Stop. This parking space is always at your disposal, lawyer. I had to deal with Germans who wanted to park there. Have you seen Buonaiuto, the town hall janitor? - Yes. - And he didn't leave anything for me? Of course, he gave me this envelope. - When were you going to give it to me? - Right now. Here it is. He said this time you have to give him ten thousand lire. - He's insane. - That's what he said, ten thousand. Is he going on a vacation? What do I know? Wait! Wait! Did you make a reservation? Good morning, Mrs. Carmela. Good morning. Can I buy you a "grappa"? Mrs. Carmela, the lawyer can't drink that. He has an ulcer. Mind your own business. If you don't mind, can we change it for a glass of milk? - As you wish. - Beautiful and kind in every way. - Lawyer... - What? Someone called looking for you. That's why he called here. His name was Milosz. No, Milosz no. Catozza... Cocozza! - Settembrini? - Yes! Settembrini! That's his name! Pasquale, you need to start writing stuff down when someone calls. How am I supposed to do that? I'm busy with clients. - I need to talk with you. - Don't worry, I'll talk with you too. - Good morning, lawyer. - Good morning. Do you have that permit for the contraband cigarettes? Here it is. Just got it straight from the advisor in person. What a treat! How much do I owe you? What I paid for it. 30 thousand lire. As for my fees, we'll talk about that later. Lawyer, this is a permit to sell candy. The permit is to sell candy. If then you sell cigars it doesn't matter to the police. - If you say so... - I do say so. Ten, twenty and thirty. Thanks, lawyer. - Lawyer... - Sit down. For you. Be right with you. Hello? Lawyer Lovine... What do you mean? The case is closed. The opposite party has died. We won. - Lawyer Lovine. - Who's calling? No, I'm not talking to you... What? Thank God I've found you. Don Michele wants to see you. Tell Don Michele that I can't right now. I'm with a customer. I'll go see him later, okay? Lawyer... right now.. Leave! Leave! Get out! Good morning, Don Mich?. Why such a hurry? Here is why. Read. Don Mich?! Improta is waiting for you at the office. Good morning, Marullo. Where are you going? Can't you see the light is red? He's busy. It's very urgent business of Don Michele. Some urgent business is more urgent. Sit down. How is it going, Marullo? Good? Mind your own business! Sure... - Lawyer, always at your service. - Improta... He says I can keep that souvenir. Sign here. Mar?, French striptease, see? This one could even raise the dead. Did you hear me? You're not interested, eh? "Requiescant in pace" - Very kind! - You can go in. Here we go. Hello? Did you read it? Yes, sir. - And you don't say anything? - What do you want me to say? That your daughter ran away from home? Lawyer... You've worked for me other times... with good results. - Thank you. - But now I need you to focus on this job. - ...it's specially delicate. - At your service. If I can help... You have to bring my daughter back. I'm glad you trust me with this but I'm afraid I'm not the right person. Why don't you send one of yours? I don't know... Improta, he was just outside. No, Improta is too dumb. I need someone smart, like you. Someone that can convince people easily. Easily? Here your daughter says... "I'll die of indignation and disgust... if I stay a second more in this house. Don't look for me Forget me and get lost." - And you say "Easily". - Lawyer... Go check what that asshole Marullo is doing. He's always eavesdropping. Dirty business always must be kept quiet. And I need this to be kept quiet too. He's sleeping in his chair. He's been with me for twenty years. And I still can't figure if he likes me. or if he would like to see me dead. What a mystery he is! - Lawyer... - Yes? My daughter, blood of my blood, threatens me. There is no threat here. - She called this morning - Then she isn't missing. Where was she calling from? Did she say? Yes, she said she was at my house in Faeto... Without any respect. She was like a stranger. This is how she thanks me for everything I've done. Yes, but what's the threat? Sending me to jail. Giulia? Your daughter? How? With my daughter has disappeared a folder, some very important and sensitive papers. A folder like this one... Inside there are things that can't be seen by the public. And your daughter organized this whole thing to blackmail you? My daughter Giulia is 19 years old. If she grabbed those papers it's because someone told her to. And I think I know who that was. This one right here. A bastard. These were taken a couple of months ago. His name is Pino Gargiulo. The poor girl lost her mind because of him. And organized the robbery. Yes Don Mich?, I understand. But I'm not the right person for this job. - Why did you call me? - First of all... because I don't know why, but women trust you. - Poor things. - Second... This... This woman that lives with you... - Her name is Luisella, Don Mich?. - That's her problem. She's friends with my daughter and could help convincing her. But I have my job. Very important clients. And some urgent business. Third... I have this bill of yours, half a million. To be paid by Monday. Monday is the day after tomorrow. - Aren't you in a hurry to pay it? - Yes, but we always postpone it. Well, this time I'm not postponing it. - I'm a bit short of money right now... - I'll throw it away... if you do me this favor. If you bring Giulia and my papers... I'll have a wad of... - Two thousand lire? - Two million, lawyer. Where is that house in Faeto? Villa Tina, in honour of my wife. That's where she is. Please... I hope you crash! Twice! Hello? I'm coming in... Miss Giulia? Miss Giulia? Giulia Miletti? Hello? Hello? Lawyer, is that you? What are you doing? - Who is this? - Is Don Michele there? Speaking. Then, you found my daughter? - No, not your daughter. - Speak louder, lawyer. Something terrible has happened, Don Mich?. Your wife is here, Tina. My wife? My wife is in Caserta, with her mother. No, she's here... She's here. I'm still shaking. What happened? Something terrible, Don Mich?. Really terrible. - Your wife is in the bath. - What? What are you saying? That she's dead, Don Mich?. - Hello? - Dead? My wife? - Yes. - And how did she die? I don't know! There's a man here, on the sofa. - A man? - Yes, she wasn't alone. That man from the picture... The one with a beard. - Pino Gargiulo? - Yes, Pino whatever. Then it was that bastard! I want him dead. That's already done, Don Mich?. If you want to come you can see him. - Hello? Don Mich?... - Eh? - Listen to me. - Yes. Find that folder. - The folder. - Did you hear me? Yes. No, I won't do anything. I'll call the police. There are two corpses here. Listen, I'll call the police. - Yes. - You look for that folder. - If it falls into hands of the police... - Good lord! - You don't get that wad. - Yes. Did you hear? Find the folder. Don Mich?, this is a double homicide. Even worse is that I'm in the middle of it. Hello? Hello? Don Mich?! The folder! What folder? I'm leaving. Damn it! Who are you? I'm Catelli, the night guard. And you didn't see anything right? No. I was sleeping in my room. As usual for a night guard... Holy God, what a tragedy! Poor Don Michele! My wife made you something hot because you're also scared. But, did you now that the dead...? I mean, were they alive when they arrived here? - No. - Yes, yes, yes. - No! - Yes, yes... The police are going to be here soon. Get your story in order otherwise you're both going to end up in jail. - Jesus! In jail! - And what have we done now? I make 120 thousand lire a month. I'm not going to jail because of someone else. Those two were doing dirty stuff. Even on the balcony. - Dirty stuff? - Yes yes. Shut up! - That's not true, Sir. - No? Have some respect for the dead. Respect! What respect! They made the poor Miss go insane. Giulia? She was here too? She was. She looked like she had gone mad! - That's not true, Sir. - I don't want any trouble from them. I'll tell everything to the police. They are going to find that bag Miss Giulia left here anyway... Of course... A bag? What bag? The one Miss left here. Where is it? Where did she leave it? In the office, right by the door. Didn't you see it? Sir, there is a corpse in the bathroom and another one on the sofa. Consolini, take some pictures of the bathroom. Then the sofa. Come on, come on. - Lovine? - Yes? You're lawyer Lovine? The one that found the corpses? - That's me. - Good night, Assenza... Somaruga, Bertini... go upstairs and start with the bedroom. So, you're the person Miletti sent to find his runaway daughter. - Yes, sir. Why did he ask you? Let's say I'm a friend of the family. I know some things about the house, their traditions... Poor bastard... Then you probably know why the girl left. - No, I don't know that. - Didn't you say you were a friend? Of the family, not the girl. - Close friend? - Pretty much. What can you tell me, Consolini? The wound seems to be from a 32 cartridge. Like the other one. Lawyer, have you ever been asked to undress in this house? They are good people, chief. They don't do those things. You're right. Maybe I'm exaggerating. You are. Fine, I'll try to be more sensitive. In your opinion, between that naked lady and that naked gentleman... - Yes? - Was there an intimate relationship or...? Or they were naked because they were hot? If you want to be malicious you'll always find something wrong. And that's just what I'm looking for. - Can I? - What? Ask you another malicious question. If you're okay with my answer... Tasty. - Let's try to find her together. - Sure. When Mr. Miletti called the police... why did he ask to speak with the chief of police immediately? Maybe because they are friends... And he would know how to ignore certain compromising papers. What do those papers have to do with the murders? They have something to do, don't they? That's what I think. - Can you give me a cup? - Here. Why don't you relax? I see you're very nervous. Leave that folder, sit with me and let's talk. Here. - The cup. - What cup? Oh, sorry. Do you want a coffee too? - No, thanks. - Fine. So, we were saying that the deceased... was Giulia Miletti's mother right? No Sir. The mother was the first wife, she died in childbirth. Then the second one. No, this one is the third. He divorced the second one. - Ah, three wives and one daughter - Three. - Let's say he is well-off. - Well, in what sense? If he was poor he would have at most one wife... - And at least a dozen kids. - Right, that's true. If I don't write this thing about the three wives and a daughter... I'll forget later on. Do you have a piece of paper? - Paper? - Something to write on. No, I don't. - Let me see in the folder... - No! There is nothing there! It's empty. It's empty? Look. - It's empty. - It's empty! - Then, let's recap... - Yes. You come from Naples looking for this girl... - And you find two corpses. - Two corpses. And you walk around with an... empty folder. That's okay by me. Why? Is it a crime to walk around with an empty folder? - No, please, that's normal... - Almost normal. Chief, this bag is stained with blood. Do we take it to the lab? "G-M" What does "G-M" mean? General Motors. Good. General Motors? What a coincidence. General Motors has the same initials as Giulia Miletti. - Do you have a light? - No, I don't smoke. That's my wife. And this one, do you know him? I don't. His name is Giuseppe Gargiulo. - I've never seen him before. - Your daughter knew him very well. I would know. My daughter told me everything. - But said nothing about running away. - Chief... I've had enough for today. I'm tired. I don't want to spend my whole day with you. I'm done. Can you come with me, lawyer? Well, well. We have all the time in the world to speak. - Wake up, lawyer. - Good morning, Don Mich?. - Give me a little of everything. - As you wish. Lawyer... Two hot dumplings? Two stabs to my stomach would feel better. Look, lawyer... Ten blocks. 500 apartments. Three thousand lire a year. Unfortunately this is how they build nowadays. This is the fifth one I built. Ah, you built it? For what? The more one does... the more people hate one. You work and everyone betrays you. Even family. This is the only thing I have left. My work. The results of my blood and sweat. And I'm not going to let them take it from me. Lawyer... My daughter didn't kill them. She's a kid. If the police catch her... they'll put her in jail with the whores until the trial. And that's a humiliation I won't be able to bear. Did I make myself clear? Did you make yourself clear? I don't know. Maybe its because I've been awake all night. What does your daughter have to do with the 500 apartments? The papers Giulia took are part of a side business of mine that I didn't tell Don Nicola Casali about. - Your partner? A partner I only go to for complex projects. He's a man that doesn't care about the means. Corpses don't bother him. And if he finds my daughter with those papers he'll kill her. He'll kill her, lawyer. And you think Don Nicola Casali would be more bothered by my corpse? Only my daughter is in danger. If you take those papers yourself... she'll be safe. And you won't have to do anything else than come and pick up your four million. - Four? - Precisely. And the satisfaction of having helped a father. Always. Are you sure that folder was empty? The folder? I have it in the car, Don Mich?. If you want I can go grab it. Don't bother. Go get some sleep. And bring me some news as soon as possible. Tonino, do you think the lawyer is awake? I don't think so. He has low blood pressure. He needs a cardio-tonic. Yes, a stimulant. Stimulant? Here. Now he's awake. Lawyer, I hope we didn't make too much noise. Who are you? Pasquale and Tonino, at your service. And now that we've been introduced, can you get up? What do you want? Maybe he needs some help. No! Lawyer! What are you doing on the floor? Tonino, come help him up. No, please, I can do it myself. Well, lawyer, our business here won't take very long. Just the time it takes for you to give us those papers and we won't bother you any more. What papers? Tonino, how can you ask the lawyer such hard questions so early without even offering him a cup of coffee? Get the lawyer some coffee, we'll talk after that. A coffee for the lawyer! What did you do? Without any sugar? Sweeten it up a bit. - How much? - At least two sugar cubes. Sugar! Was it sweet enough? I take my coffee without sugar. If you want us to prepare good coffee you'll have to explain these things. Sure. The coffee worked. Where are those papers? If I tell you the truth... - Will you believe me? - I will. But Pasquale is a bit distrustful. You can give it a try. If you're talking about some papers that might be inside a red folder I don't know where they are. - And what's this then? Motherfucker! Piece of shit! Where are the papers? Asshole! See? He didn't believe you. No, wait... - Can I ask something? - Let's see. If it's related to the papers. - Can you see my face? - Why? In your opinion, is this the face of a hero? - One that dies without talking? - No. It's a matter of common sense. If I had the papers would I take this beating? I would have told you after the first hit. Even more, threatening me with a knife He's right. Pasquale, it's getting late. Don Nicola Casali is waiting for us at the restaurant. Get dressed and let's go eat. Let's see if Don Nicola has more common sense than us. - Can I go to the toilet first? - Yes, sir. But leave the door open and don't get any ideas. What ideas? Do you think I'm going to drown myself in the bidet? I took the liberty of ordering for you. Since I know you have exquisite taste I asked for spaghetti with some octopus and sauce. I hope you like it. My God, Don Nicola, this is poison to me. I'm very thankful but if they could boil a bit of white rice. Or maybe some carrots... Or some chard... boiled. No, eh? You can have some carrots too. As a dessert. Are you English or what? You have to try the local speciality first. What are you doing, Lawyer? Are you going to eat them one by one? That's going to take a while. No, its just that I never eat... Pasqu?, get some wine for the lawyer, maybe this way he gets some appetite. - No, not wine... - Cheers! - Do you take care of your health? - That's why... Then drink. Well, I'll drink. But I'm warning you that I get very ill... Ill? A young athletic man like yourself? No, I'm fine athletically. Its that physically I feel like I'm rotting away. This wine comes from Papalardo's village. It's as if he trod it with his own feet. And now, have a big bite of spaghetti. Papal?, help the lawyer. He's too polite. I can eat myself. Let's avoid these unpleasant scenes if we can. Very tasty, not bad at all. Only one thing, you'll have to take me to the hospital afterwards. There's one nearby. Call the hospital as soon as... the spaghetti starts coming out of my ears. Thanks. - Drink, lawyer. - Eh? - A sip of wine. - A sip of wine... Very nice. No thanks, I would rather not. Lawyer, men are animals. With an empty stomach it gets grumpy. Once its eaten it becomes more communicative. Let's see if you're feeling communicative. I don't have those papers. And I'm not going to find them even if I eat all the spaghetti in the world. Then it seems you haven't eaten enough. - No, its just... - Papalardo. Explain something to me. What do you gain if I die right here? Maybe you haven't seen what side you should be on? Eat this bit of spaghetti and then we can talk. And if I don't eat it? Boys, what happens if he doesn't eat it? Fine, I'd rather not know. Bon appetit. Boys, the lawyer doesn't feel so good. Give him a hand. Let's see, Lovine... I'll send a driver to pick you up at home. I treated you to a meal for which I haven't been thanked yet. And always kindly I've asked if by any chance you knew about those papers that are worrying me. And you, as the piece of shit you are didn't answer me once. If you know everything why do you need those papers? To convince Miletti that he needs to respect our partnership. The sewer contract should have been done together. Five billion. Nothing to be sniffed at. And it's not right that he takes it for himself. What if I convinced Miletti to share the deal with you? Lawyer, there are some moments that you seem so naive to me. Not even God could convince that big sack of shit that has hired you. Only I can convince him. But only when I have the receipt of certain payments done from Switzerland to your boss in my hands. - That's easier said than... - You get me those receipts and I'll convince him. - And if he isn't convinced? - He will be. He will be. Meanwhile I'll send him the twins to tell him that he broke our contract. Don Nic?, don't mess with Miletti. He'll get angry and I won't be able to do anything. No, don't worry. Just a reminder. - Yes, fine. - You get me those papers. And I'll give you a million for each thousand in the contract. Yes sir, five million on delivery. And the satisfaction of having the friendship of Don Nicola Casali. All this satisfaction... but, could you maybe anticipate half a million? Its just that I have a problem with a debt due this Monday... No? Forget I said anything. Don't bother with these lousy scenes. I'm not moved. This time I'm leaving for good. Yes, ma'am. - Won't you ask me why? - No. You don't care where I'm going? I didn't even think about it, Luisa. That's what I wanted to hear. This way I can leave for good, without any remorse. Fifteen years you've been leaving for good. And you're always here. Its useless to hide behind that cynicism. When you call me only silence and remorse will answer you. Are you really sick? No, it's my way of having fun. Luisella, you're a good girl. Very affectionate. A little bit of a pain in the ass, but you get over that with time. You had a chance with that Raimundo. He was a handsome boy, Raimundo. Had money, wanted to marry you. He insisted a lot, Raimundo. I don't have any present or future. Only a past which to top it all, sucks. Why do you insist on being with someone like me? I love you, Sas?. - Then you're hopeless. - Its you that is hopeless. If I left you what would you do? I would lose my babysitter. Look what a mess you've made in the day I've been gone. Can you promise something? Whatever you want. Anyway, you already know I'm a liar... This afternoon, when I get back from work we need to have a serious talk about our future. - What a day! - But first I have to call Formia. Formia? Call Raimundo, you'll be better off. Hello, Raimundo? No, better like... Raimundo, hello? Hotel Bella Vista? I want to talk with Miss Giulia Miletti. Yes. Ah, no? Could you give her a message, please? Tell her that Luisella can't go pick her up this afternoon. That I'll call her tomorrow morning. Don't forget. Thanks. What do have to do with Giulia Miletti? She's up to her neck in troubles. She ran away from home. Really? And she's also pregnant. And what did she go to Formia for? She went to see a friend of mine, a doctor. Why? What is she going to do? Then, will you wait for me? Where do you want me to go like this? I'm dying! - See you later. Take care. - Don't worry. Hotel Bella Vista? My wife just left a message for Miss Miletti. Yes, Giulia... Forget it. She's coming to pick her up. Is it done? Don't worry. When this bomb explodes... Lawyer Lovine is here. - Bring him in. - Yes. Hello? I won't ask you if you want some. I'm sure you've already eaten at this time of day. I've had an aperitif. I'm old. Only one meal a day. At noon, like the dogs. Did you find Giulia? Yes, I have. But the girl is in trouble. - The police are looking for her? - That too, but that's not it. What did she do? Nothing, the same as every other girl. Just that she.. is pregnant. Shameless! She's trying to kill me. - And where is she? - In Formia, hotel Bella Vista. Eh, what are you doing? Get lost! Mind your own business. - Ton?! - Wait, I'm almost done. Dear God! What's happening, Ant?? Don Mich?! Don Mich?! Come down! They are killing him! Casali's twins. The shotgun! Run lawyer, they are killing themselves! My goodness! What's going on? Eh! Ant?! Ant?! Ant?! They killed him, Don Mich?. Casali... He probably found out about the sewers contract. We have to call the police. And you need to go to Formia immediately. I'll have those papers here before tonight. The papers! Damn those papers! You don't care about the documents? What do you want me to worry about? They found my wife dead with another man. And my daughter runs away from home pregnant. My driver gets killed. But that's my problem. You have a contract with me. No, I just had to do a favour to a father whose daughter had left. - For four million. - We won't understand each other like this. We speak two different languages. You say "my driver got killed" and I say "Antonio got killed". How many million will you give Antonio? And how many is my life worth? If I wanted to sell I have a good offer from La Rinascente. For 200,000 lire a month. - Who cares about La Rinascente! - I do, I'm telling you. Make a deal with Casali and give him his part of the pie. - There's enough for the two of you. - Pie? He's going to be eating medicaments from now until he dies. - Don Mich?, there's corpses every day. - Fine, six millions and you leave immediately for Formia. - Why do you give me those millions? Which I do need. Don Mich? do this... if you want the papers go find them yourself. - How much? - A hundred lire. Run, you shit, I'm going to kill you! Bastard! Hurry, there's a car trying to run over someone. Help! Help! - What happened? - Don Michele is hurt. - Where? - On the floor. Hurry! - Don't touch me, I'm dying. - I'll call an ambulance. No! There's no time to lose. Go find my daughter. Ask me whatever you want but swear that you'll go. Fine, I'll go. And don't tell anything about Casali to the police. I will... deal with him later. Can I sit? Well... I thought that Formia was close and it took me almost an hour to get here. No, Luisella didn't betray you. I came by my own initiative. To escort you back to Naples. Your presence there is required because... Unfortunately there's been an accident. Don't worry, it's not serious... But your father... is in hospital. - What? You think its funny? - What happened? Someone put a bomb under his car. Antonio is dead. I think your father only has a broken back. With all this I think its time for you to go home and forget what has happened. He can die. I don't care. I understand your reluctance because Luisella told me about... Your condition. But don't worry. Your father is an old fashioned man. At first he'll get really angry, then he'll love his grandson. Even when he pees on him. If you want we can tell him together. I told him two months ago. Ah, he already knew? - How did he react? - He wanted me to abort. - My... - Anything else? Nothing, thanks. - Anything to drink? - I've had enough food and drink for today. So your father knew... I told him. And he involved that liar, Commissioner Lentizzi. To scare Pino. - Pino Gargiulo? - Yes. It's his kid. Am I smoking? I don't smoke. But Pino wasn't your mother's...? Wasn't he with your stepmother? - Excuse me. - Don't worry, you can cry. I also have a lot to cry for but no time to do so. Here. - Pino told you to take those papers? - Yes. He convinced me it was the only weapon we had to keep my kid alive. I would have done anything. - And now... I don't want him any more. - Why not? He didn't love me. He only hated my dad. He made my dad find him and Tina together on purpose. And maybe he got me pregnant on purpose too. When I saw them, cuddling on the sofa... I wanted to kill them. What are you thinking about? You're a monster, like the everyone else. No, I believe you. When you found them you ran away. But the police know that you came back too. Yes, I did. I don't even know why. But they were already dead. It was horrible. And then, I had to run because someone was coming. And the papers? The red folder was empty. I have them. And wouldn't it be better if you gave them to me? No? I'm just thinking about your safety. Those papers have become so dangerous. Why don't you get rid of them? - It's the only weapon against my father. "Against"... He's still your father! I'll take them to your father. You come with me and it'll all be over. I don't want to! That's what Pino Gargiulo wanted you to do. How did you meet Pino Gargiulo? Marullo introduced him to me about a year ago. Marullo? Your father's secretary? Excuse me, I'm going to clean up a bit. Marullo... What does Marullo have to do with anything... Chief, what are you doing here? I was about to ask you the same. What are you doing here? I came to have a cup of tea with a "crostata". Oh, you were with someone. I don't want to intrude. No, I'm alone. They serve on the other side of the table here? Yes, it's because I wanted to change seats. The air on my back annoys me. Since it doesn't bother me if you don't mind... - I'll sit here. - With pleasure. - Well, here's the tea. - Please. Drink, eat. As if I wasn't here. - Do you want anything, Chief? - No thanks. I only have tea with "crostata" in Naples. But this one is a speciality. - Home made? - In the hotel. Now I understand why you came to Formia. It sounds great to drive 100 km to have some tea and a hotel made "crostata"... Alone. - Isn't that normal? - Very normal. Lawyer, you've been dealing with a bad day streak. You find two corpses, another one in Naples and are the witness to a deadly hit and run, after leaving a house where a bomb explodes later on. A bomb, lawyer. This world is going insane. Are you trying to say that I'm involved in those deaths? I call them murders, don't forget. No, I'm not saying that. I'm just making conversation. That makes four. And after four deaths who doesn't want to go to Formia to have some tea with "crostata"? Aren't you eating more? I'm leaving, you do whatever you want. - And the cigarettes? - What cigarettes? - Ah, that. - Its easy to forget cigarettes for someone who doesn't smoke. The only thing that's not normal is precisely you. They used to tell me the same in the church. Pasquale Lauria is the man that was run over. He died. Left a brother. Did you know him? The dead man? Not at all. Sure. But his brother swears you did. He's looking everywhere for you because he's convinced that his death was your fault. Are you serious? And where did Giulia Miletti go? What does Giulia have to do with anything? She's just a kid. I know. Listen, you always seem to arrive before me when there's a corpse. I wouldn't want you to have more bad luck. If you found those papers that you swear you don't know about. Do you hear me? Yes, loud and clear. Its just that I don't understand this at all. It shows. You look like a gazelle in the middle of a pack of lions. Anyway, here: my card. With my telephone, you can reach me there anytime. If I get lost in the forest I'll give you a call. That way you can come save me. Speaking of the forest, that Tonino, brother of the deceased, just happens to work as a goon. Now that you're going back to the burrow, be careful - because you're a gazelle - Then I'll change burrows. Dr. Branchini, to the operating room. - Good morning, lawyer. - Hey, how's the old man? He was always angry, now he's plastered. Sister, please, Mr. Miletti's room? - Third floor, room 633. - Thanks. - Where are you going? - I'm Mr. Miletti's fiscal adviser. - Can I go in? - I'm sorry, but that's impossible. It's important, I'm a friend of his too. Maybe you could make an exception? Police protection ends tonight. You'll be able to talk as much as you want tomorrow. Do you mind leaving us alone a moment? I want to talk with Mr. Marullo. - Of course, sit down. - Thank you so much. Did you know Pino Gargiulo? - Miletti's daughter told me everything. - What's everything? What was Pino Gargiulo doing in the office? He came every month to pick up money. Some type of salary. - Don Michele's money? - Go figure, it was someone that you don't know. And that doesn't have anything to do with this. You hate Don Michele, right? You didn't just give money to Gargiulo, you also told him about that folder. - I didn't tell him anything. I mind my own business. And who told him, Casali? If one minds their own business, he doesn't know about those things. - Why, are you leaving? - Yes, my shift is over. Can I go with you? I want to ask you about the police. Its just that I have a nephew that wants to join. He just graduated. Please, after you. I for example, studied as a rigger. But police give the best security. That's why its called a "security force". - Thanks, very kind. - Glad to help. Dear lawyer, what did you do? Where are your manners? He was missing. He didn't even sleep at home last night. We've been waiting all day. Here you are! I thought you would be dead somewhere. The poor lady was in despair. - We thought something had happened. - How hard is it to make a call? Luisella, do me a favour, go down to the bar and buy some coffee. We have coffee. Then go down to the bar and buy pastries. We have pastries too. Then go down to the bar and buy something we don't have! I see you're a little nervous, lawyer. How is Don Michele Miletti feeling? Like someone that had an accident with a bomb. Bad luck lawyer, just bad luck. The dead driver was bad luck too? For him yes, for us it was an accident. I just wanted to give him a reminder. But he left a widow and five orphans. Lawyer, don't confuse yourself. You also have your own problems. And with someone like Tonino following you, a friend like myself could be useful. Are you threatening me as a friend? - My God, we are partners. - You're wrong. Because that bomb also blew up the deal with Miletti. Even better. Now you only do business with me. I'll make that wad grow to 10 million and you find those papers and the girl. - What do you mean "the girl"? - Lawyer, do you think I'm sleeping? No, you can have insomnia for all I care... And if I don't find the papers? Lawyer, let's not announce misfortunes before they happen. - Think about your health. - By the way, what do we do with Tonino? That's a problem. Since his brother died he's searching heaven and earth for you. - And the sea. - I don't know where he is either. - In Ischia. - What's he doing there? Taking a ship to come back to Naples. - Are you leaving? - Yes ma'am. Thanks for your hospitality. Thank you. Come back soon. Don't make us worry. - But, what happened? - What happened? You disappeared! Thank God your friends came to keep me company. That Casali, he's such a good person. - Yes, eh? - He was so worried, about you, about Giulia... - Did you tell him she's in Formia? - Yesterday she was in Formia. - Today with her stepmother. - Did you tell them? No, they didn't ask. Are you happy I'm spending the night with you? Yes, this way you can keep me company in the car. The car? Miss Elena Miletti please. - There, room 1. - Thanks. She left for church. - What church? - The one nearby. Since we don't know the way would you let the girl accompany us there? No. I don't like to leave here alone in the street. Don't worry ma'am, we'll bring her back. - A present. - Patrizia, please, don't let go of the lady. - That's her, that woman. - Which one? - The one that's keeling down? - Yes. - Take the kid back. - I'll wait for you there. Ms. Elena Miletti? I'm Lovine, the lawyer... friend of Don Michele. What do you want? I wanted to talk about the accident, I'm not sure if they've told you. I don't have anything to talk about. Leave me alone. Ma'am, wait a moment. Go away. Leave me alone. I want to be left alone! So rude! - What do you want? - Ah, excuse me, reverend. I just wanted to talk with Ms. Miletti. It's important. - You can tell me. - It's personal. Madam came to see me to confess... and I managed to... how do you say... - I don't know. - Calm her down. But you arrived and managed to make her hysterical again. Father, I just told her about the accident. It's not that bad. It's not bad for you, a young man... - Who? Don Michele? - They've murdered him like an animal. No, he just has a broken back. A leg a bit bruised... A young man, 27 years old... - Pino Gargiulo? - Ms. Elena's son. Ms. Elena's son... What a mess. Excuse me? - Thanks, father, excuse me. - Where are you going? Where would I go? Sas?, hurry, hurry! She started feeling ill in the doorway. I brought her home. She told me some things... - Where is she? - Inside. My poor son... I didn't know, I didn't know! When I told her out of the blue, she ran away, poor girl. - Who ran way? - Giulia. Didn't know Pino was her son. - Nobody knew. Nobody. - Marullo knew. - Who? - Marullo, Miletti's secretary. He knew. Yes, Pino went to get whatever little money he gave us that month. - Who gave you money? - Miletti. He threw me out like a whore. After 15 years of marriage. Do you understand? - No, why did he throw you out? - Because I didn't tell him about Pino. Pino was an illegitimate child. I had Pino before getting married. - Who's this man? - I'm the husband of the lady. - We are not really married yet. - With all this you need to specify? Now Giulia is carrying the son of my son. Yes, but Giulia wants to abort. - Sas?! - Its better that she knows. It can't be! Poor Pino! I'll go to the police right now. They need to know who killed my son. - You know? - I don't have proof. - But I'm sure. - Who was it? Are you from the police? - Not really but... - Then who are you? - We're friends of Giulia. - Friends... Excuse me, I didn't even offer you a coffee. Don't worry, we'll have one afterwards in a bar. Poor Pino, poor Pino... My son! Don Mich?, do you hear me? How are you? What do you mean, missing? I'm in Rome. I was at your wife's house, Elena. Yes, I know. I meant ex-wife. She was lying down because of the pain. Lying. With an "L". Because of the death of her son. I know it was personal but you could have told me. He was still your son. And they kill him like this... Don Mich?, I can't do miracles. I'm between four deaths, a bomb and a chief of police that keeps chasing me. It's a miracle they haven't arrested me yet. Yes, but Ms. Elena knows who it was and will go to the police. This way everything gets sorted out. By the way, Ms Elena told me that Giulia went to her old babysitter's house, did you know about this? Ah, you didn't know... Do you know the address? You don't... And her name? Rosa? Ah, you're not sure... And the surname? You don't know. Thanks for the help, Don Mich?. I'll manage. Yes, I'll hurry. You rest. See you later. Luisella, did you eat? - Yes. - Then let's go. - Who was that? - Another good person who's worried about my health. 48, 49, I think I miscounted. - How many did I say? - Eh? It will look so good on you! That one? - What? - Giulia's car. - How would I know? - You've been in the car. - Do you remember the colour? - How could I see the colour from inside? - Was it a Renault? - And with all the Renaults that exist who says this is Giulia's? - A Renault with a Naples plate? - In this village? Whose else could it be? - Sas?, I don't know about cars. Without understanding about cars keep looking and don't move until I come back. I'll go see if they know anything. - Who is it? - Lawyer Lovine. Does Ms Rosa live here? She used to babysit...? Come in. Luisella! She's here. Excuse me... Thank god that Tonino didn't find him. - Did I get run over by a train? - No, just that beast called Papalardo. You aren't running any more. You ended up in Casali's hands and now we're both in trouble. And I was already in trouble. It was you who came looking for it. All that for the small change that my father gives you... What would you know about money? You always had it for free. - Free? - Yes. Free. If you had to bust your ass to get money you wouldn't have time to get in trouble. You made this mess. And you are angry with me? What are you running for? And what should I do? Live with a father that despises me? And have a son I don't want? Miss Giulia, that's your problem. To keep or not that kid is something you need to decide yourself. I've never let others decide for me. And where do you thing that's gotten you? To shit. But at least it's my own choice. You're in it too and don't even know why. - Now you cry? - I've only had Rosa... Everybody else only knows how to lecture me. Well, don't take it personally. I have a short fuse. And today, God know why, I'm a bit on edge. Its useless. There's nobody in the village. But Luisella is there. She's not. Where did she go? If we could untie ourselves before he woke up... Shut up, if he wakes up you won't be laughing. He won't do anything right now. He's waiting for someone called Tonino. Even worse... Where's Rosa? Your babysitter. I don't know. She wasn't here when I arrived. Let's hope she doesn't show up right now. - Where are you going? - Look out! Come. Open Papalardo. It's me, Tonino. Open! Here. - Where are we going? - I don't know! If we could get through... Nothing, that's as far as I go. - Sas?! There's a ladder. - And what do I do with a ladder? Ah, no. Maybe it could be done. If God helps us. Help me. Let go. Careful! I can't take this stuff any more... Great! - Will you be able to cross? - I'll try. If we can get to the other side he won't find us. Easy. We're almost there. Come on. Don't look down. Look forward. Like that. Good. What are you doing? - I'm scared of heights. - You can't be scared right now. Walk! Come on, you're almost there. Why did you stop? Come on! Like that, very good, Giulia. See how easy it is? It's not that bad. You're there! Now hold the ladder down. - Hurry up. - Easier said that done. Why do I keep getting... I'll try what you did. - Look out, Sas?! - Call someone! Help! Asshole... Say hello to my brother. Help! Help! Hurry! Chief! - Hold on! - Depends on how long. Easy. Stay still. You're coming with me. You did good to bring that shotgun. It could be useful. Now go up those stairs and... Sas?! What are you doing up there? I'm checking out this great view! Come on! Move! Are you from the police? - Keep going! - When did you arrive? Move! - If you allow me... - Commiteri! ...Sas? went in there to ask for Giulia, and wasn't coming back... - Move, Commiteri! - ...then I went up to the other village... ...and luckily I found... - Take him to the car. ...this kind man with a hunting license that... Lady don't try to play detective. I'm already here. - And I'm lawyer Lovine's girlfriend. - I'm working, not on holidays. When you are done caching up we are still up here. Yes I understand. But don't worry they arrested both of them and nothing happened to the daughter. Yes, don't worry, Don Michele. So peaceful! I'm thinking of staying here. Lovine, you're a good man. Deep down I almost like you. But why do you work for people like Miletti, Casali...? Do you know you're risking your life? And who should I work for? A department store for 200 thousand lire a month? At least I'm a free animal. I can do something new every day. - Chief, if I was a tiger... - A tiger? You? Well, a gazelle. I would prefer the dangers of a forest than the tranquillity of a zoo. - I understand. A stupid gazelle. I want the smells and colours of a forest. Yes, I could get killed. But with eyes full of life. Very well. Also a poet. Then listen to this other poem: Yesterday at Via Tasso a sewer collapsed and killed two people. I was there when they took them out. And they didn't have eyes full of life. Naples is collapsing under the sewers built by those tigers. And every time someone dies there, the investigation gets stopped. Because those on top never leave any clues. But this time there are clues. And I want them. Miss Miletti says she knows nothing. Try to know something yourself. You have my number, you can find me any time day or night. See you around. If it's necessary... Sign here. - Hello? - Come in. We just finished. - What a racket you have going on here. - Don't worry. I just talked with your father. He told me not to leave you alone. He's worried, the poor man. And sadly he's still at the hospital. - I hope he stays there. - God is fair. Giulia, we know you don't like him. I don't either. He said "Lawyer, if its necessary I'll send you a lawyer". He's right about that. - Luisella, I need to talk with Giulia. Can I? - Talk. Sas?, forget my father. But for real, forever. Well, I'll forget. But meanwhile I have to take you to Naples. - No, I'm not going. - What do you mean "no"? You said it yourself. I need to decide for myself, and I'm going to do so. - Right now? - We decided to keep the kid. - Why are you in this mess? - Luisella is right. - She convinced me. - And you're staying here alone? Rosa will take care of me and the kid. Right? No, its just that your father had to give me... Fine. I was joking. - Come on, let's go. - Sas?. The papers are at Elena's house. In a vase on the bedroom dresser. - It's open! - Someone broke the lock. - Don't go in. - And how do I get the papers? Hello? Hello? Let me go! What are you afraid of? Ms Elena? Ms Elena? It won't come on. Maybe it's broken... Fuck! Luisella? What happened? Luisella? I'm not feeling well. Sas?... Get me out of here. I'm not feeling well... - Get me out of here. - Yes, come. - Wait here. - Where are you going? - Sas?... - Shut up! Holy shit! - Sas?, where are you? - Shut up! - Marullo? - Sas?, when are we leaving? Now! And fast. The businessman Miletti marries Ms Elena Marullo. - Luisella, don't cry, it's distracting me. - Why don't we go to the police? - I have to go see Miletti first. - Damn Miletti and his papers! Everyone that had them is dead. They'll kill you too! - Better! That way I'll have some peace. - Then let me get out! When we get to Naples. - I have to pee. - Do it in the car. Luisella, wake up! Go up to the flat and call Marullo, this is his number. - He'll be sleeping. - Then you wake him up. Tell him that Elena has been murdered. - Why should I bring him the bad news? - Just because! - Hurry! I have to go see Miletti. - Sas?, get some rest. Go tomorrow. Don't make me lose any more time. I have to get there before him. Before who? Dear lawyer, I'm so happy to see you healthy. - If I'm healthy its no thanks to you. - That Tonino... Well, it's true that when twins are not together they don't work any more. That's why I now have a new pair. Do they suit me? Don Nic?, if you don't mind. I'm in a hurry. Don't run, lawyer. Just now I told my dear ex-partner that the sewer contract is cancelled. Thank God, sometimes contracts get broken instead of sewers. Those great businessman have decided to do one more important with me. It just took a call to Rome. Lawyer, I like you. Be smart. Come see me. That'll be hard. We have very different tastes. Then it means you didn't understand anything. You didn't see who's in charge and whose side you want to be on. You're a zero. And that's what you'll be forever. Lovine, sit down. - Where's Giulia? - Giulia didn't want to come. She has decided to keep Pino Gargiulo's kid. - Only bad news today... - And that's not all. Your wife, Elena, is dead. Murdered. What was that? You don't care eh? That woman has finally finished messing up my life. Right, they had an illegitimate son and didn't tell you. - I don't know why they tell you these things. - Maybe they saw a glimpse of humanity in me. They only see an animal in you. Don't you even think about treating me like that because... Because? Don Michele? I only told you to bring Giulia back here.. - And you come to talk about my wife. - No, you don't care about Giulia. You sent me there to find the two corpses. You thought that if you sent any loser they might pin the murders on him. But unfortunately for you, I found the third corpse too. - Lovine, you're miscounting. - No, you already know the numbers. It's 6 million. You wanted the papers? Here they are. Lovine you're getting on my nerves. Spare me your presence. Those papers don't interest me any more. - But this does. - What's that? The signature your goon left on your wife's corpse. I don't know anything about that. Then I'll take this to the police and they can explain it to you. - What are you saying? - That you picked a starving man and turned him into a mercenary. I'm open to offers. Fine. Leave the pen and take those 6 million. No. Six million was the price of my life. Now we are talking about yours. How much are you worth? A hundred million? Two? A billion? How much are three human lives worth? You don't have enough money to pay. See? Now I'm too expensive for you. To me you're still the same starving man. But one that can afford the luxury of telling you to fuck off for a billion. Because you would tell me to fuck off right? But the satisfaction of sending you to jail can't compare. Go ahead. Improta! The lawyer was telling me how much of an idiot you are. Some illiterate like you losing a pen? Luckily the lawyer found it. But he says he wants to go to the police to report you. Do him a favour... and go with him. Not here! Take him outside! - Why did you do it? - Marullo... Listen to me... - Why did you kill Elena? - Marullo... Lawyer, mind your own business. Wasn't it enough to kill Tina and Pino? That bastard wanted to bankrupt me too. After fucking my wife and my daughter. But you? I've always helped you, I've loved you. You've been by my side for 20 years. No, you put me 20 years in a chair to blackmail me and my daughter with that pocket change you gave me. But without Elena, I don't need that money any more. She wanted to go to the police! I had to do something! - You don't have any right to live. - Ten million! A hundred million! - Two hundred million! - You can keep that money! A priest... Someone call a priest... No, you have to die like an animal. - What happened? Who shot? - I don't know. - Did they kill him? - Come on, go back to bed. There's no danger, go back to bed. Nothing happened. Sas?! Marullo is coming. Says he wants to kill Miletti. - Be careful. - It's okay darling, thanks. Hello? I want to talk with Assenza please. Yes, its urgent. Unfortunately that case isn't in my hands any more. They took away the sewers case. And disciplined me. It seems I unclogged the sewers and someone... smelled it. Ready, Sir. Like a mirror. Chief, I have those papers. I didn't bring them to the station because I wanted to give them to you personally. Then you'll have to give them to my replacement Commissario Lentizzi. - Miletti's friend? - He was. Now he's Casali's friend. And of that congressman that gets him the permits. Tell me something. In a moment of weakness I gave up the money for those papers. And you're saying that I have to give them to Lentizzi. But afterwards what will he do? Stop Casali. Accuse the congressman, the minister of public works will shoot himself. A lot of resignations... It could lead to a revolution. - Yeah sure. - I'm overdoing it, eh? - You are. Fine, then nothing will happen. I'll say more, you know what? He'll keep those papers, they'll disappear and nobody will talk about this again. What if I trick you this time and go to a newspaper and tell everyone what happened. I'll tell them everything. - Fine. - And maybe they'll pay me something. Two coffees! Lawyer, they say they've killed Don Michele Miletti. - Who says? - They do. It was Gennaro Marullo. He killed Improta and Don Michele at the same time. - Really? - Is it in the newspapers? No, but my nephew told me. He works at the railway. By order of Don Michele, his goon Improta killed his nephew and his daughter who lived in Rome. - And that Pino Ga-Gargiulo. That was an i-illegitimate son of Ms Elena Mi-Miletti. Ms Tina, rest in peace, was a beautiful woman. - Don Michele was already old... - Old? What he was is a cuckold! - How many? - Th-the cuckold was 77. The lady 43, and the horns tw-two. One and two. It was all because of money! No ma'am, Don Michele hated Marullo. That's it. When I was young Don Michele's father stabbed the brother-in-law of a cousin of Don Gennaro Marullo. Jesus, what could the poor man do? He had two snakes by his side. One day he found them together and killed them. All this happened because of some very important papers. And doesn't have anything to do with girl trouble. - Watch out. - We can at least save the coffee. - This table is wobbling. - Why don't you use the papers? - And how big was that wad? - Everybody knew that. - How do you say it? Public knowledge. - But how many people died in total? - Seven. - No, the deaths are actually 5. Because Antonio and Pasquale died in the sewers war between Casali and Miletti. - Have you heard? Don Nicola Casali has pair of new twins. - Yes, it seems a bit gay in my opinion. - It is very gay.
