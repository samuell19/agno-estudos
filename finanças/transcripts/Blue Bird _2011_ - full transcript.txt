What else can it do? The teacher taught me that, because he flaps his wings fast, he lifts up. These are the eyes. And this is the mouth. He eats worms and bugs. This is his tail, he uses it to steer. This is his butt, but his poop is much smaller. How come he's blue? He was born like that. - Was he born like that? - Yes. Who gave him to you? Luma. Why would Luma lend you this bird? Because, we are friends. - You must be really good friends. - Yes. T?n?. Bafiokadi?. Your bath is ready. Children? Are you deaf? Go home. Mother is calling you. I really have to go now. Yes, dad. Stay here, we will be right back You both have to learn to listen Come I have been calling you for ages. Undress yourselves, I don't have all day. Come on, into the tub. Cold. Is it cold? It will make you strong. The bird is gone. We have to go find him. Come on then. Come on then. We have to find him. Or my friend won't play with me anymore. Over there. Run, run, run. Little bird? Little bird? Where is he? Don't know. Look, daddy! He is driving very fast. He must be really in a hurry. I heard him working all night. So, where do you think the bird went? Teacher told me that if a bird disappears, he is off to find his family. Maybe he's got eggs. Or maybe he met a little female. What? Impossible, if he would have met a famale he would have told me. I guess you're right. He will come back, don't worry. Birds always come back. So let's wait. But I wanna play. We wait. It sounds like granpa's singing. I hear it as well. It makes me feel sad. That's because he's buried here. And my father is dead And my mother is dead And my children are not dead And their children are not dead neither But I am dead And my wife is dead And my father is dead And my father's father... - Knock it off! - I sing whenever I want to. You're not cheering me up. I sing about life. And death. You should sing about me, instead of everything that's gone. Once I was a rich man But everything in life dies - Even kings and queens die - Grandpa and grandma - I knew it. - I can smell his pipe. My cows and chickens are dead All my friends are dead... - Grandpa and grandma. - Hi T?n?. How are you? I thought you were dead. Did you? Well, we are dead, but that doesn't mean... that we're not here anymore. We're always here As long as you think about us. Hi grandpa. How are you? And how's your father's business? He said I'm strong enough to help him chop wood. What is this all about? You come here and visit us and we're all happy and then you start crying. I'm happy, look. T?n?, you're not a little girl anymore. You're growing up fast. And before you know it, you'll be a woman. And women don't cry. You do cry. You even cried last week. And the week before that. That's different. It's the same. I'm trying to teach the kids something. Yes, but you're saying that women don't cry. They don't. Not in public. This bird is blue. Let's go home and play. What are you doing with my pigeon? I'll bring him back. We are going to play. Say hello to your mother. Be careful! They don't have manners. They come here, take our pigeon and disappear again. I was going to eat him. I've found my bird You've found your bird My beautiful bird Your beautiful bird My sweet bird Your sweet bird As blue as the sky As blue as the sky He went to see his family He went to see his family And now he's back And now he's back I've found my bird You've found your bird My beautiful bird Your beautiful bird Do you want me to take it out? All right. It has turned white. This is another bird. We should keep it. - But the other one was blue. - Be happy! - I'm not. - Be happy! I'm not, he isn't blue. It doesn't matter. It does. - It doesn't matter. - It does. - You're acting up. - He has to be blue. Give me that bird, I will keep it. You're not very nice. I think you're acting childish. But the bird was blue. It doesn't matter. It does, but the bird was blue. You're a baby. - That's not true. - Yes, you are. No. - It doesn't matter. - It does. It doesn't matter. We have to find the blue bird. It doesn't matter. which color the bird has. That's not true. He has to be blue. It's dad's motorbike. Don't touch that. We didn't see you there. What are you doing, father? Hello. What a surprise. What are you doing? What am I doing? I'm chilling. Are you looking for wood? Or waiting for someone? I'm not looking for wood. And you guys are here. You know I make tables and chairs. But sometimes I have to make something else Did you make that chest? Yes I did. It's a coffin. When somebody dies, they ask me to make a coffin. I'm bringing this one to a family. Look! Those big cars again. Those are not cars. They're trucks. Where do they come from? You're too young. You will find out. By the way, what are you doing here actually? This is not a playground. Go home. You know that your mother could use some help. Do you hear those children too? Yes, they're singing. It's beautiful. You know, I think it's a school and everybody is sining, because they are on a trip. Every time I'm on a trip, I like to sing as well. I don't think it's a school, it's a very big family. And they are moving because their house broke down. Because of all the fires, and maybe they are not singing. Maybe they're all crying. You fat ass. Watch out, watch out. They are so stupid. When I was little, I used to run up that mountain, then I took my wheel and ran down. These little kids are so stupid. They don't know how to steer. - Listen! Listen up guys. - Listen to him. My neighbour T?n? was bathing. So I took a rock. Climbed on the wall. And threw the rock at her. And she fell. Was she naked? I warned her that I will attack her again. Stay here. I'll be right back. I've found my bird My beautiful bird My sweet bird As blue as the sky He went to see his family And now he's back Quick, her protector is taking a leak. She smells. Take their bird! Little chicken, little chicken... Cover the face. Quick, the chief is coming. Hurry up. Girls are too stupid to play with boys. What? Lady, are you talking to me? What's wrong? You fell? I would love to help, but... I have a delivery. It's urgent. What? So you cannot walk. Isn't there somebody else? You need a ride? I'll drive you. Stay there. You are luck that I heard you. I was lucky that I saw you first. Easy. Don't worry, lady. The small roads are bad. So where do I go? - With me? - Yes. Koufitougou. Koufitougou? That is far away, lady. I went to the market this morning. I have sold all my chickens. And now, I got enough money to make a new table. But on my way back, my legs just blocked. Turn left here. Easy. Do you know what I do for a living? How should I know? I'm a carpenter. I could make you a table. I would fix you a good price. You are not a carpenter, you're my driver. Why do you say that? My son is my carpenter. Then why isn't he driving you? Because you're my driver. I only drive you because you're old. No, you're driving me because you're young. He's dead. He's alive. He's dead. He's alive. He's dead. He's alive. He's dead. Dead. Why are you digging a hole? To bury Luma's bird. This is not Luma's bird. I assure you he's alive. I hear his little heart beat really fast. All dead things are buried. What are you playing? Burying bird. Why? Because he's dead. We have to stop them. Don't you hear it? Could you stop for a moment? - What's the matter? - I feel a bit strange. But we're almost there. Just one minute. Old lady? Old lady? Are you okay? Got to be kidding me. Look over there. It's that carpenter. He doesn't stop chopping up the forest. He chops up the trees. My brother and sisters, my parents and children, my family and friends. And he sells them as furniture. He makes tables and chairs, doors and even coffins. But he never comes back to plan some new trees. That's why I'm angry. That's why I'm ill. You hear me? And now his son will have to pay. I will catch him and show him how cruel the forest can be. You don't take something without bringing it back. Grab him, grab him. Quick, his dad is coming. T?n?! He isn't there anymore. Are you lost, little girl? Come here, children. - Sit down - Higher, higher Sit down. What are you doing here? We're on a quest. - A quest? - Yes. - Did you find what you're looking for? - No. What are you looking for? I'm seeking my bird, he flew away. Flew away? Stupid children. Didn't you know? That's how life is. If you let go of a bird, it will fly away. He was going to wait. - Did you let him go? - Yes. If you let him go, then it's your fault. That's life. But life has others sides as well. Are you listening? I'm in reality the Chief of Pleasures. I'm the chief. And I'm going to teach you something. It's even essential. Real pleasure is not up in the sky, that's why I'm not wasting my time, chasing a bird. Because, if happiness constantly flies away, I'm going to look for it on earth. The pleasures I find over there, are the pleasures that will stay. Isn't it? That's why it's time that you two realize that you're never going to find the bird. Not that bird. It's becoming time you two start to look for others birds, earthly birds, and they sing. They sing, and nobody can resist. Well, listen. - What's your name? - Bafiokadi?. - And you? - T?n?. Listen, T?n?. Now you're sitting next to each other. But before you know it, T?n? will be running after you. I swear it, I see those things. That's right. Thank you. Bafiokadi? will be running after you. I once was running after birds. All these men were running after birds. And before we knew, we were running after women. And when they start singing, no man can resist. So instead of chasing a bird, you should capture its song. Why do I laught, when my heart is always troubled? Joy joy my heart is full of joy Joy joy my heart is full of joy All my friends have left the cottonfields Joy joy my heart is full of joy Joy joy my heart is full of joy I wonder how you capture a song, when there are no words. You just have to remember the melody. The sun is low, the day is almost at an end Our shadows reach far, as if they were our brothers My shadow is eternal but I will soon sleep Trees are my witness, as they slowly weep All tears are water, those from happiness and those from grief My song is not a song, but a piece of my heart My brother, my shadow. It is time to say goodbye The sun is low, the day is almost at an end Our shadows reach far, as if they were our brothers There is the moon reflecting your light Take care of me, as I enter the night I walked a long road but now the real journey starts My song is not a song, but a piece of my heart My brother, my shadow. It's time to say goodbye What's wrong? I'm afraid my friend will be sad, because I let his bird fly away forever. Bafiokadi?? T?n?. Do you want to make me a promise? That you never become like one of those men, earlier, when you grow up. Sure. But before I can promise this, I need to find that bird. - Hi little child. - Hello. I'm happy to see you. - You have a very funny hat. - That's because I'm not born yet. Unborn children first spent a long time in their mama's belly. That's true. - Afterwards. - What do you mean afterwards? What? You have to know that before children go to their mom, they have to wait a long time first. Look, more children with funny hats. They're waiting as well. Hello. Are you also going to be born as well? We are all unborn children. I will be a football player. Me too. There are some more of them. They are girls. Nice to meet you. - You have nice dresses. - You too. Let's go and play football. Are you all football players? No, we are princesses. I want to be a football player as well, and a carpenter like my dad. I want to be a mother and a princess. We could all play together. Let's make a team and play. Let's go. Good morning children. Make a row. Here, come. Come, come. Make a row. Make a row. Where is your hat? You. Stay here. Who else? You, where is your hat? Come here. Only children with hats. Go away. Good morning, children. I'm the king. King of Time. You're in the Kingdom of the Future. Welcome. But here, there are some rules to obey. You heard me? There are rules to obey. One. Arrange your hats. Two. Make a row. Three. Silence. Thank you. You have a long journey before you. So before you leave, everybody checks his hat. You too in the back. Did you hear me? Check your hat. Little children in the front, did you hear me? That's good. Now drop your hands. Drop your hands. You heard me? I have to tell you. You will be travelling a long, long road. In fact, only some of you will arrive. Who? I don't know. So that's why I take care of all of you. I make sure you all leave well. And I hope you all realize the importance of your trip. Because this is no rehearsal. Being born is not a joke. Do you understand me? It is important that you all leave at same time. I don't want to see anybody running ahead or behind. It's time. Come on. So many new friends. I have to tell mom. I am happy. What are you playing? Building a house. Donn?, check. Francis, check. Eric, check. Fr?d?ric, check. Joseph, check. Nestor, check. Hortense, check. Th?r?se, check. Jacqueline, check. Albert, check. Baudoin, check. Philippe, check. Hippolyte, check. Romain, check. Rosie, check. Antoine, check. Marcel, check. Andr?, check. Marie-Th?r?se, check. Jean-Pierre, check. Tr?sor, check. Consolatrice, check. Gr?goire, check. Martin, check. All children are present, so listen one more time. If you see a white light, don't be afraid. It means you are going to the earth, and two parents will be waiting for you. Before we start boarding, I just want to remind you that there are no winners, there is only fate, good luck. Safe trip. Thank you! Tell the driver to drive slowly, because the roads are bad. There're holes. He shouldn't speed. He has to drive gently. - Did you understand me? - Yes. - Did you understand me? - Yes. - Safe trip. - Thank you. Aren't you happy to leave on a journey? Yes, we are happy. Safe trip. Thank you! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Do you think Luma will be angry? I don't think so. He will understand. All birds fly away, if you let them go. I hope you're right. Let's go home. Children? T?n?. T?ne. Bafiokadie. Where have you two been all day? Come. You need to bathe again? What a waste of time. I washed you in vain this morning. Go into the water. Lift your arms. And your back. What is that? Your dress doesn't fit you anymore. That's weird. Tomorrow I will make you a new one. Bafiokadi?. Come. Dry yourself. And stand over there. Dry yourself. Take the oil. Rub it. Bafiokadi?? What's all that? Your shirt doesn't fit you either. How is that possible? I'll make you a new one as well. Subtitling TITRA FILM Paris Transcription from DVD: evertonbazu
