- Did you pay for the drink? - Yes. - Sorry I'm late. - OK. (woman moaning) I'll call you. - Hi. - Wait, Michale, you have messages: The attorney, Lilinblum, called twice, and Tzila from Social Security. - Is my father here? - Yes. - Should I call them? - Let them call back. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Michale... - What's all this mess? Orit, come on. - I didn't have time to clean up. Do you want me to do it now? - No, no. - Sorry, I need the addresses. - OK, but not now. - They're in the computer. - OK. I'II... In a minute. I'll help you, just let me finish. - Michali! - Coming, Dad. Hi, Dad. - Where were you? - Hi. - It's about time. - Why is the money not yet in the non-profit organization's account? - The issue is now being handled by the Ministry of Religion. It's a matter of days. - But this association already exists for years. This last payment is like oxygen for us. - Who's the one in charge? - Yitzhaki. - Give him a call... - I already did. - Talk to him again! - Meir, please. I need a formal document. Look, in a week, God willing, it's the opening of the Yeshiva. The respectable Rabbi Ozeri will move into the new Yeshiva! The students have nothing! How will I face the people? - It's a bureaucratic matter... - OK, but some suppliers need to be paid. Talk to him, if it doesn't work, I'll talk to him. - It worked fine. Really, everything is arranged. - OK, send him a fax, we're wasting time. Just do it. Come on. - I need to have something in my hand. - Everything will be okay. Don't worry. - "... seeing as the bank transfer to the organization was not made... " - Bless you, Gabai. - "... please see to the matter as soon as possible... " - "As you recall, the account number is... - OK. "As you recall... " - OK? - Hi, Mommy! - Hi, my love! How are you, my love? Give me a kiss! Hi, Nehama. Sorry I'm late. I had a crazy day at work. - It can't go on like this. He's the last one here every time. It makes him insecure. - You're right, it won't happen again. - Make an effort, it's important for him. Nathi, remind Mom to bring your sneakers tomorrow. We went on a trip and it was horrible. - No problem, I forgot. - So try to remember. Not to be late, and also remember the sneakers. - No problem. - OK? - Say goodbye to Nehama. - Bye! - Bye, Nathi. Bye, sweetie. - Bye, Lili. (Nathi jabbering) - I want one like this. Mom, I want to help you with the bag. - Take it, my love. Oops, watch out! Here, love, take it. (microwave dinging) Put the toys away, we're eating now. - He's jumping on one leg. The dark one can jump on one leg. - Now put it aside, we're going to eat. Nathi! No, wait. Toys away. Enough. They will be over here. Let's eat a few bites, then we'll go play. Just a couple of bites and we'll play. OK, sweetie? I don't want you to go to bed like this. A few bites? For me, OK? Nathi? For me. Oh, you're a hero. Take your toys. Just a minute. Take your toys and Batman. Okay. (Nathi laughing) (Michale tickling Nathi) Oh, I'm in love. Look what I found. I'm gonna eat you. - Look over there. - That? - No that, over there. - Let's tell it goodbye. Or goodnight? Give Mommy a kiss, twice. Twice. Good night, my love. Good night. - I'm exhausted. What's up? - So am I. - Is he asleep? - Yes. - Just a sec, I want to see him. - Don't wake him up. - He's an angel, this kid. What's up? - I'm okay, how are you? - I'm so tired. I work very hard. - What did you do today? - I prepared contracts, showed apartments... I'm not happy with my partner. Today I called him, I said: "Hi, I need you. " He said: "No, I'll call you back in five minutes. " He called me back five hours later. I do everything alone. - I already told you how to get rid of him. You never listen to me. - You're right, I'll do it. - He dropped the sword. (Nathi jabbering) Oh! What's happening to him? The wheel broke down. Get to work! Put the wheel on! Drawing a c-I-o-u-d! Drawing, drawing... And now? Now a cloud I am drawing? They are underneath. Under, under, underneath. (Nathi singing) Shabbat Shalom to you! - Shabbat Shalom! - Shabbat Shalom. - What a mess you made here! - Where's a kiss for Grandpa? - Shabbat Shalom to you! - Shabbat Shalom. - Come, let's clean up. Look at these drawings! Come, let's pick up the colours. - Michali! - Come on, let's eat. - Shabbat Shalom, honey. - Shabbat Shalom, Dad. - Where is my kiss? - Hi, Michali. - Hi. - Shabbat Shalom. - Shabbat Shalom. - You smell like perfume. - No, it's hand lotion. - Coming? OK, come sit here in front of me. - Come sit here. I'll sit over there. No talking during Kiddush, OK? - No talking. - Is there a yarmulke for the boy? (Nathi jabbering) - Shhh... Now Grandpa is saying Kiddush. (praying in Hebrew) To life! Amen. Say amen. - Amen. - Where is the Jachnun? Did it cook on the hot plate all night? - All night. Can't you see? - That's great. - What can be bad about Jachnun? It's good. - What do you mean? What could be... what could be bad about Jachnun? - So what? - Shmoulik, peel Nathi's egg for him. This takes all night to prepare. It's a lot of work. - It's just dough, you spread some, you roll it and put some of that on. - Since Friday morning, I see Michali going like this with her fingers. - Never mind, Dad, it's okay. - Michali... - Shabbat Shalom. - Shabbat Shalom. Thank you for this tasty Jachnun and God bless you. And you, Nathi, do you like it? (Nathi jabbering) - To you. - And to you. - How was this week? - Great. Great week. A little hard. Working hard, we're starting to see some income. It's a new office and people are coming. It's nice. - Very good. - It gives us fuel. We want to have another child. Now, we can. - There's something else I've been thinking about, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity... - Shmoulik, not now about work, please. - Who's talking about work? - Let him talk. - Why aren't you eating? Eat. - I'm full. - Where's your yarmulke? - It fell. - And? - So did the Jachnun. - It fell? - That's not work talk, we are just chatting. What? You observe Shabbat, now? - Shabbat is the only day for the family to be together. It's the only moment that we have all together. Let's forget about work. Every Shabbat it's the same thing. We sit down for breakfast and boom - WORK. - OK, you're right. - Now is not the time. - I see him once a week, we want to talk. It's never the time. - What's wrong with that? - We see each other so rarely. He wants to consult. It's not about money or business. We're sitting and talking. So, what should we talk about? Do you want to go to sleep? Come. You want to take a nap with me? - With Grandpa? - Come, love, come. I'll show you something. - Good night! - I'll show you something. Look at what I brought you. On the sofa. - There. - I can't see. - There. - Aaach! What's going on here? - Let's rest a little. Come here. Once upon a time there was a monkey called Kofiko, and this Kofiko was naughty, always stealing bananas from children. Understand? Do you like this story? Do you prefer me to sing? - When I tell you to. - Come here like this. - Are you upset at me? - Not at all. - Not upset, right? - Not at all. Shmoulik... Shmoulik! Dad is here! Shmoulik... (Nathi screaming) (Nathi laughing) (praying in Hebrew) - To life! (praying in Hebrew) Amen. (praying) Amen. (praying) - It smells so good. - Go like this with your hands. (praying) Amen. May we have a good week. - It's once a week... - They're going to smoke, we're going to play. - No, come on. (Nathi jabbering) - Can we go to Rachel's? We're going, what's wrong? - No, Dad, you don't... - You're not still...? - Let's go to Rachel's to eat. - No, no, no. - She's waiting for us. - Enough, I'm tired. - Shmoulik? Let's go to Rachel's for a bit? - No. Enough, I'm tired, honey, really. - I'm ready to go. But whatever you like. - Rachel! Rachel! - Yes? - We're not hungry anymore, just from the salads. - It's coming. - That's it, tomorrow is a new week? - God willing, yes. - May it be a good week. - Let's first enjoy today. May it be a good week. - Here you go. - Now, a cigarette? - Dad, let it go, I'm full. - Eat, please. - Rachel, thank you very much. - Eat up, dear. - No, give me just a little bit. - Eat as much as you like. - Enough. - What's wrong? Eat up, guys. - He's little, he won't eat more. - Slowly, slowly. Rachel! Come and sit with us. - What? - Come sit with us, doll. - No, no, later. - What, you're busy? - She's a little shy, but she's great. - It was great, Rachel, thank you for everything. - Enjoy, kids. - Special tea, usually you drink it as an essence. - That's why we're here. - Shmoulik, come on, let's go. - Just a few minutes. - Not for me, thank you. I can't anymore. I'm stuffed. Thank you. - This is what we came here for. - Come on, where's my bag? - You drank too much arak. - I didn't. Maybe you did. - Come on, let's go. - We'll drink the tea and go. - Enough, Dad. I'm so tired. - Why are you so tired? - All day long we're... - You're not going to work now, you're going home to rest. - We're together since this morning. - Since when staying out late makes you so tired? - Dad, cut it out. - I used to wait for you till 4 AM when you were young. - Oh, come on. - That's how I met you. Once, we came from the club at 4 AM. - I used to hear the key in the door and run to my bed, so that she wouldn't see me. - Dad, enough! - So that she enjoys herself without thinking about me. - They are all like that. It will be the same with this one. - I brought them together, so that they would get married. I haven't stopped bringing them together. - Come on, Nathi, we're going. - Great, Albert, make it louder. - I can't take it anymore. - Let me finish my tea. - It never ends, after tea there's cake, then the pickles... - Enough already. We'll drink tea, listen to the song and then go. - You take this and I'll take this. Nathi's tired, soon his bedtime will pass and he won't sleep. - Just a second. Let me drink. - I'll take this. - OK, want the robot? - It's the end of Shabbat. - What about it? - It's fun. - Now you're religious? - It's Shabbat, fun before the week starts. Let me breathe a little. - Albert! Make it louder! - OK! (singing) - What's wrong? What? What? (music) (water running) - Hi, Dad. - How are you? - How are you feeling? - Fine, fine. - Say, Dad, I've been thinking... are you sure it's okay what we're doing? - I don't understand your question. - I spoke to Gur, the lawyer. He said we should think twice. We give too much to Gabai. Now, he will also have power of attorney. What do you say? - Listen, I'm... I'm kind of fed up with you. - Why? - We know what we are doing. Don't we? Everything we're doing is legal. You don't have a problem with that, right? - Yes, but... - I don't understand why... - Rabbi Ozeri never asked us to cheat the number of students. - Yes, but it's too heavy for him now. We're going to expand the community. I don't know how many students there will be. - So the end justifies the means? - Yes. No two ways about it. - Blessed be he who believes. - Don't you see what's happening? Michali... I want you to cover your head before we go in. - What's going on with you? - It's a matter of respect. - What respect? Gabai will tell me what respect means? I'll do it for him? What, Dad? Come on. Dad, enough. (knocking) What? - OK, enough. - Hello, how are you? - The Rabbi is here, yes? - Uh... yes. - We have an appointment. Is there a problem? - No. Just a minute. Gabai... the accountant's daughter is here, her head isn't covered. She came with her father. - I'll handle it. I thought we discussed this. - What's wrong? - If she wants to show respect for the Rabbi, she has to cover her head. - I have a lot of respect for him. He's always known me and doesn't mind. - You can leave the documents. - I'm not leaving them. - It's my fault, I just forgot. - It's the customs of the place. - I just forgot. - Welcome. Please come in. - We have an issue. - What is it? - A problem of modesty with the head cover. - Right, but it's okay, she's used to going like that. Let her like that. She isn't doing it on purpose. Please come in. Come, Michale. - Good morning, Rabbi. - Come in. Sit, sit, please. (Rabbi coughing) - Rabbi... in a couple of days we are finally moving into the new building. God willing, all this will happen in time for the inauguration of the House of Talmud. And we were truly blessed by Meir's devoted work. - Rabbi, it's very important. We all agreed that you are to be the organization's chairman; all this was done in your name... and because of your reputation in the community. All this to bring back... the days of glory. This is our dream. - Excuse me. What is important to me... is that you understand this process: When the non-profit organization grows, and receives more than 750,000 shekels of revenue, the State requires having an accountant to oversee things, a treasurer, in this case the president of the organization, Gabai. - Rabbi, we have here an opportunity, like Ma'ayan Hillel, the yeshiva in which I was educated, that started out small and is now one of the best of Jerusalem. And to start to save many souls in the neighbourhood. - I just want to say this: I don't know much about these things, all I want is to teach Torah, to teach our kids here. And I feel a little bit uncomfortable, if you'll forgive me, that we... I started this place in 1954, since then we've done just fine with the same people, working people, who come to learn the Torah. And I am inside my people here, we help each other, we're close in the neighbourhood. - God forbid. Our entire aim is to strengthen the neighbourhood. Because foreign workers are flooding here. God have mercy. - This is the issue. Your greatness lies in your modesty and in your wisdom, but, you can see what's happening in the neighbourhood, how the youth is deteriorating. You see? Drugs, crime... Entire families are being ruined. It's time to do something. Certainly the State doesn't care about it. - There's one more thing, very important. We think, at least I think, that... thanks to the work of Meir and his daughter - may she live a long life - we thought it would be fitting to commemorate his late wife with a memorial plaque at the entrance to the House of Talmud. - Yes, it's a very good idea. It is indeed thanks to this woman... - Thank you very much, Rabbi, I didn't know about this, really... I prepared three copies: Two for the Registrar and one for us to keep. Yes. Your signature... - Where will we get the money? - I will explain. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you very much, Rabbi. - Let's go in here, to Simon's. I like to sit here. - Yes, let's go. - Simple, popular and tasty. - The important thing... opens up all the possibilities. - Sure. It's a procedure that we have to go through. Can't move without it. - Yoni? What's up? OK, I can meet you now, so let's meet at Atarim Square? OK. OK. (sirens and honking) Can't I drive through here? - It's closed. (sirens and honking) - What happened? - There was a bombing, you can't pass. - A terrorist attack? At the square? (excited chattering) I'm supposed to meet someone in there. - There might be a second bomb. You can't. - Don't push me! Can you tell me what happened? - There was bombing at the café. - Can I go through? - Hey! - I want to go through. I am supposed to meet someone there. - Go to Ichilov. - Do you have a list of the people that were in the bombing? - What happened? - There's an information centre over there. - Where is it? - At the hospital. There are phone numbers. - Which one? - Ichilov. (sirens) - Excuse me? Excuse me? - Just a second. - I'm looking for Yoni Peretz. From the bombing at Atarim Square. - No, he's not here. Go to the information centre. This way, then make a right. Don't worry, he's there. - Thank you. - Have a seat, the moment we have info, we'll call you. Sit. I'll call when she's free. No, no. Sit down. I will tell you, OK? - Can I check a name with you? - Not with me, with her. I'll call you. - Can we visit the... - No visits. (chattering) (phones ringing) - Excuse me? I have to pick up my kid from the kindergarten. - The minute she's available I'll call you. - Excuse me? May I? - Yes, yes. - Yoni, Yoni Peretz. - Yoni Peretz? What's your relation to him? - A friend. - OK. OK. Five minutes. Merav! Merav! - Yes? - Can you come here for a moment? She wants information on Yoni Peretz. - Yes. Come sit with me. I'll call the doctor and maybe she'll be able to help you. She doesn't have more info. What's your name? - Michale. - Come wait here, OK? I'll be right with you. ...Her name is Michale, his name is Yoni. - Hello, Michale. I understand that you're looking for Yoni. - Yes. Yoni Peretz. - Are you a relative? - No. - Look, I'm sorry. I can only give information to the family. But I can give you the family's number, you can call them and they will tell you. - I can't really call... - I'm sorry, I can't. - Can you just tell me if he's okay, if he... - OK, listen. I'm sorry, Yoni passed away. The family is on its way to the morgue of Abu Kabir. Maybe you should contact them after all. I'm sorry, Michale. We have a psychologist at the hospital. I would like you to talk to her, OK? Don't go home like this. OK, Michale? - I just need to pick up my child. - I think Mommy is here. (Nathi singing) - The dog... - Sit, sweetie, don't fall. What happened? - I'm really sorry. - I hope so. I've been waiting for you an hour and a half. I can't watch your boy like that. I'm not a babysitter, I run this place. I can't afford to do this every day. Plus, we couldn't reach you, so we were worried. - You're right. - I'm right? I know. So maybe it's time we had a little talk. - Everything is okay... - Everything is okay? Every day you're late. Something is wrong. Talk to me. - I have to go. - Sit down and talk to me. - I'm in a hurry. - I'm in a rush too. Today I want you to sit and talk to me. This can't go on, Michale. Please, can you sit? Thank you. I'll talk to Mommy for a minute, OK? What's going on? You have to help me out, for Nathi's sake. Do you think he doesn't notice it? You have to help me to help. Are there problems at home? - No. - Michale, you have to work with me. Nathi is always the last child to be picked up. For now, he's okay, but he's becoming nervous and that's not okay. So if something is wrong, we must find a solution and see how we can help him. This is for him. So talk to me, please. - Nehama, I cannot. Come, sweetie, we have to go. - Wait, we have to pick this up. - I really have to go. Shall I give you a ride? - I'd love to. Sweetheart. - It's fresh, so there's no problem. With fresh fruit, you don't have an issue of religious fallow. But with dried fruit, there is always a doubt. - Can you verify it? - Yes, it's best this way. These are things we must... How many people are there? - Come with me, and check it all out. Michali! We have to go to the market. - Dad, I have a lot of work, maybe you can go alone? - Forget all the work now. This is more important. - Dad, I... I'd prefer that you go alone. I have a lot of things to do, I'm exhausted. - It's not up for debate. We're going shopping together. You hear me? This is in memory of your mother. - I know. That's why it's difficult for me. - What's so difficult? Come on, let's go. Hey, what's the matter with you? Why is everything an argument? - Come over here. For two? - No way! - What's wrong? Be with me. What's happening? I want to understand. Why are you like this? Sour, upset, smoking all the time. What's wrong? - I don't like the way you talk to me in the office. I do the best I can. You shouldn't criticize me in front of other people. - What people? They're like family. Who? Is that what hurt you? I know you do your best, but it's a big responsibility. But you can't disappear, show up late without calling. Besides, you know I didn't mean to hurt you. You know I can't hurt you. I'm your father. I'm sorry. I apologize. I apologize. Do you forgive me? Let's do the shopping now. Maybe we should buy some fish? No? (merchants hawking their wares) (praying in Hebrew) (praying) (praying) - Holy Congregation, we have today the honour of hosting a man whose entire work is devoted... to glorifying our sacred Torah, both in his neighbourhood and elsewhere. It is our honour to welcome our friend Gabai, may his ways be blessed by the Lord. And for the mission he is committed to, may the Lord light his way and help him continue to benefit the people of Israel, for without faith, the people of Israel have no hope for life. With your permission. - Please. - May we succeed. Thanks to our forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; (congregation responds) Thanks to the Rabbi Ozeri; to Meir Aaron and his family; Shmoulik; the synagogue keeper, may God bless you and protect you. When I first came back to the neighbourhood 2 years ago... I was very sad. I came from Jerusalem... and I could not believe my eyes, how our community had shrunk. I could not believe the behaviour of some of our youth in the neighbourhood. God have mercy. One hundred... one hundred synagogues in this neighbourhood, and most of them are empty and run down. The synagogue... is a sacred place, the heart of religion and tradition. But today... thanks to the Rabbi... thanks to the faith of many good people and the dedication... And I'd like to thank our friend Meir for his hard work towards this day. Today we are finally opening a new centre for Talmud studies. A centre of light and joy. A place to which, God willing, many students will flow. (congregation): Amen! - A place we have to build together. This way... we can once again understand the meaning of the teaching: "As long as the Torah remains in our hearts, so shall live the memory of the Great Temple. " Thank you. Honorable Rabbi Ozeri, please. - Sit, sit. Please sit down. I, um... Ahem. I don't want to bore you. I just want... There isn't much to add to Gabai's speech. I would just like to thank my friend here, Meir Aaron... Michale, his daughter... may you live long for enriching us and being enriched by a beautiful new edifice, built in the memory of your wife, may she rest in peace, Shira Bat Murabia. Studying the Torah is important. The place of study is important as well. And as we know, our only wish is to teach charity and peace. Charity is not the least important, and may peace rise within us. And now, my friends, I ask that we go to the new building, to the new Talmud Torah... with joy and singing and praise. We will go there thankful and bless the Mezuza and inaugurate the plaque. And may there be joy in our hearts. Gentlemen, before we leave, candle lighting at seven-eighteen, and Deuteronomy section. Don't forget, huh? (singing) (singing) Michale? Michale? Come. Come here, this is in honour of your mother. Come, stand here, between your husband and your father. Please, my friend, come and pray for the memory. (praying in Hebrew) (congregation responding) - Nathi, give Mommy a kiss. Thank you very much, really. Thank you. Is everything okay, dear? I'm proud of you. (speaking Hebrew) - Michale! - Is everything alright, Michale? - Yes. - Have you noticed you're the only one without a head cover? - Gabai, do me a favour, leave me alone. I'm trying to be alone. - You're a married woman, you know what? What's your problem? You have a problem with all this? Do you understand that in this building students will learn Torah and pray for your mother? Do you have a problem with that? Why are you not with us? You know how much sorrow you're causing your father? - Are you finished? Not a man like you will teach me morals. - Michale! Michale! (police sirens) (waves breaking) (birds cawing) - Can you please tell me where you've been? - I want to go to sleep... - You can go to sleep. Just tell me where you were until 10 AM. - I want to go to sleep, I don't feel well. We'll talk later. - What happened? - Nothing happened, I'm fine. - Where were you? I tried hospitals... I don't know what. - I went out to breathe some air. - Something happened? - Nothing happened. - What is this? Going out without calling or anything? - I'll talk to you later. I want to sleep. - OK. Fine, go. - Why don't you answer him? Why don't you answer him? - I want to go to sleep now and that's what I'll do. - You let us worry all night, and now you want to sleep? - No one asked you to worry about me. - I asked him to come. - Good for you for going and calling him. - Don't turn your back on us. I've been waiting for you all night! All night I waited for you! Maybe you were raped? Maybe murdered? - Don't you dare! - What's wrong with you?! - Enough. - What's wrong with you? - Enough. - Good for you both. Get out of here. - You get out. - Enough. - Look how you're behaving. - I want to sleep. Am I allowed to go to sleep? - You're allowed to go to sleep. - What did you do all night?! - Don't yell. - What did you do all night? - That's not your problem. - You're my wife. - I'm not your property. I'm not your property and I come home whenever I like. And don't yell at me like that! - Don't push me! - Watch out! - Why, what will you do to me? - You couldn't tell me that... Where were you anyway? Where were you?! I'm going crazy here, worrying. I'm glad to see you're safe, but where were you? - Shmoulik! Where were you? - I went out to breathe some air. - Why didn't you tell us? - Because. - What do you mean? - Just because. - I want to know where you've been. Where does a married woman wander around all night? - A married woman is not allowed to wander? - No. Not without saying where she's going. A married woman can wander but she has to say where to. Where were you all night? I want to know where you were. Michali, you have a family. You have a husband, you have a child, and a home. You can't walk the streets at night like a whore. - Like a whore? A woman who wanders at night is a whore? - Yes. - I see. - Do you want to divorce? I'm asking you, do you want to get a divorce? Don't call me Father anymore, you hear me? I'm no longer your father! - Meir, calm down. Hold on a second. - And don't come to work anymore! I don't want to see you! Don't call me Father anymore! - Is that what you want to do? This is what you want, Michali? Michali, is that what you... - Come, come. - I want Mommy. - Come here, it's okay. (Nathi crying) - Michali, don't do this. - Where are you going? You're not going anywhere. - Come here! - You're not going anywhere! - Meir, let her go. - You're not going any... - Leave it, I'm asking you. (Nathi crying) - Don't cry, sweetie, enough. Enough, don't cry. Come, love, come. (Nathi crying) - I don't want to! - Enough, quiet down, dear. You'll wake up all the children. They're sleeping. Shhh. (Nathi squealing) Come, love, come. - I don't want to! - Shhh. The children are waking up. Enough, love, stop. (knocking) Here, I'm putting you at school. Look, it will be fun. - They're just waking up. Wait a few more minutes. - Wait? - Yes. - Is Nehama there? - Yes. - Can you get her? (Nathi whining) Enough, quiet. Give me a big hug. - What's up? - Is it okay to leave him now? - Now is not a good time. We're trying to calm them down, they just woke up. Now is not a good time. - Nehama, listen. I have a problem. I left my husband today, I left home. I wouldn't ask for this if I didn't need him to stay. - Well... here's what we'll do. I don't want him to come now, it will be a mess. You stay with him here for a bit. I'll call Lili. You rest and... We'll see what we can do later. You can stay with him a bit? Wait. Lili? Come here for a second. Because I don't want him to come in. I'll be with the children for a while longer and after work. - Everything's okay? - OK? Stay here. - Staying outside with me? Do you want to go on the swing? Everything will be okay. We'll figure something out. - Thank you. - OK? Come to my place later? We'll talk. OK? Sit, Michale. Everything will be just fine. Come. Come in. - I want to drink Coke. - Yeah? Already? OK, let's see if we have Coke. Thanks. Sweetie, take off your sandals if you want to go on the couch. Sit down, make yourself at home. You want something to drink? - No, thanks. - Michale! - Yes? - Come over here. You'll sleep here with Nathi. - I'll sleep in the living room. - No. Come in. Want to help me make the bed? - No. I'll sleep in the couch, I don't want to get in your way. - You and Nathi will be much more comfortable here. Come help me change the sheets. - I don't want to get in your way. - Michale, let it go. OK? Sorry. Here, clean sheets. Ah, like this? Yes. OK? - Thank you. - You just rest, OK? I'll get Nathi. Do you like the house? OK. So look, come here. Look at this, it's all yours. Just be careful. You see this, for example, it's very fragile, right? Don't play with it, just look at it. Don't break anything. OK? Good morning. - Good morning. - How do you feel? - Better. - Would you like coffee, tea? - Yes, tea. - Which kind? - This is good. I want to talk to the lawyer now. I'm not hungry, thank you. - Take a pita, make yourself something for later. - Thank you, Nehama. Thank you for everything. - Do you need anything? - I'll make myself a little sandwich. So, I'll see you at school? - No problem. Don't worry. - Yeah? - Good luck. Bye. - Bye. Hi, Amir. - Hello. - Is Gur in? - Yes. - Yes? - Michale is here. - Let her in, please. Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Great, how are you? - Please have a seat. - I'll close this. - Thank you. How can I help you? - OK. Look, this is a very delicate issue. So, I'll try to be focused and not... and not too scattered. My office, our office, mine and my father's, is handling a case... the Organization of the 'Or Ve Simcha' Yeshiva. This association is headed and initiated by a man named Rav Gabai. - We talked about him. The same Gabai? - This man met my father and... and abused my father's dreams. And sold him all kinds of ideologies and dreams about setting up a yeshiva and a religious school and encouraging students to repent. He misled him for two years and... and caused my father to declare a false number of registered students, in order to get much more money from the State. - You're talking about fraud? - I came here today because I decided to put an end to this. I don't want to let him get into trouble. - Article 415 states: "He who receives an item in deception "will be sentenced to 3 years. "If the felony was perpetrated in severe circumstances, he will be sentenced to 5 years". That's Article 415. - Look, this is... I'm in a difficult position here. I'm very concerned for him, I'll do anything to avoid him getting hurt. I believe with all my heart that my father didn't... understand the significance of what he did. - Your father will go through a difficult period. If he did it innocently, if he was set up, as you say, there is a way to help him. I'll just call someone from the fraud investigation and he will transfer him to the status of State witness. If your father didn't do things innocently, if he was part of it, there is no way to help him. He's in trouble. Let's hope things were done innocently. Now here's what you have to do. You write a complaint to the police and attach all the documents you have in your possession that prove your claims. They transfer them to the investigation unit. They check the material and pass it on to the prosecution. The prosecution considers it and decides whether to press charges or not. (accordion music and singing) (singing in Hebrew) - It was fun! - Yeah, it was, huh? He's a little tired. Let's go get a drink. - Where? - At the café. I sit there all the time. - OK. - Michale, I've been meaning to tell you... I think it's time you started looking for a place to live... a new job. Start reorganizing. - We'll have coffee, then I'll go pack. - That's not what I meant! You can stay! - No, you're right, I don't want to be a burden on you. It's for your own sake. - Look, it's not what I meant. No, it's just... You'll see it's important to rebuild everything now. - I needed some days to get things together. - But you can stay as much as you wish. - You're right, I'll look for a place. - No pressure. Listen to me, I know what it's like to live alone. It has many advantages, deciding for yourself what you want to do, choosing... Huh? You've done a great job so far. Yes, maybe... You see, there are two circles. Very good. Very good! What's up? - Are you happy now? Hey, you! Don't ignore me. - What? - They're from Gabai's yeshiva. - Leave it. Just ignore them. - Hey, bitch! - What's happening to you? - Excuse me? Get lost! What did you just say? - Your friend is a bitch. - Your friend is a moron! - Get lost! - Go away, go! - Stay out of it. - Bitch! - Come here, do me a favour. - Aren't you ashamed? - Excuse me? (Nathi crying) - Hi, Michale. - Nehama, they're here. - What? - The guys from the yeshiva. - Were you hurt? - They're standing there, looking at me. - Calm down, calm down. Everything's okay. Stay here, I'll handle it. They can't do anything. Relax. Lili, I'm stepping out for a minute, OK? - Hi, dear. Hello, sweetheart. Give me a kiss. - Is everything okay? - Great! I'm very glad you came, you can leave now. Now! You've no business here, there are children here. - She sent you? - She didn't send anyone. Enough, you're leaving. That's it! - What do you mean? I'm sitting here, and I'm not bothering you. Don't talk to me that way. I'm not leaving. Mind your own business! - Great! A little bit of violence now! Who do you think you are? - Who the hell are you? - What? Don't talk... OK! Come on. Pick yourselves up! Am I a friend of yours? Want to play with me? - You piece of trash! I will make sure Gabai is respected again! You killed my honour and that of all the students. What do you know about it? - I'm calling the police! - Leave it! Run! Run! - Nehama, are you okay? Michale! - Go back to the yeshiva, I'll be there in a minute. Go with them to the yeshiva. Michale... I'm so sorry for you. Sorry for those who are gone. Michale... just to make peace. It's a good deed. I dragged him here. Just to make peace. - Dad. - Ah, Mommy's here. - I'm drawing a star, don't bother me. This cat is scared. - What's up? - Hey, Nathi. - Wait until I finish. - Give me a kiss. - Wait, I have to finish. I'll give it to you. - Come. - I'm just drawing. I prepared it... No, no! - It's nice. Let's take it. Did you say bye to Daddy? Did you say bye? - He did. Take this. - Bye. - Bye. Bye, Shalom. Come, dear. - Nathi! Bye, bye! DVD Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
