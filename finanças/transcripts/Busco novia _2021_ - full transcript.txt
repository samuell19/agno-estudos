Since when do you have this pain in your back? I don't remember the exact date, but it's been a while now. - Age? - 32 years old. Do you smoke? Yes, but only a social smoker. Do you drink alcohol? Occasionally. Come on, mom. If you keep this I'm going by myself next time. Okay. Do you sleep well? Seven hours. - Try 15. - Mom. - Okay. Don't yell at me. - I'm not yelling. - Continue, doctor. - Continue, doctor. Do you play sports? - Football... - I'd say steeping glasses. Listen, doctor, you can't imagine how many times I've tried for him to play a real sport. I've signed him to swimming, basket, tennis, ping-pong, full-contact, even synchronized swimming and rhythmic gymnastics. Are you done, mom? Okay. I won't say anything else. Promise. Look. Well, for now, I don't think there's a need for surgery. Have you been operated on before? - Never. - What about your circumcision? Doctor, the thing is he was born with a big foreskin and his pee-pee started burning, so I would make him some lotion I make with aloe and chuño. - I would rub it on his... - Mom! What? What? Am I lying? Doctor Humberto Sáncos, you're requested in the emergency room. God. WE'LL NAME HIM RENZO! MOM, CAN I SLEEP WITH YOU? Why are you taking so many pictures of me? - Calm down, Johnny Deep. - Johnny Deep? I told you I'm using these for my exposition of portraits. I'm making you famous. Yes, that will look great instead of your TV. How did it go with Bárbara yesterday? - Who's looking for her? - I'm Renzo, her boyfriend. Hold on. Not again. I told you to take it easy, Renzo. You can't be so anxious. "You can't be so anxious." Where are you getting this from? Tell me, why do you think I'm anxious? - She's not here. - That's weird. Today is our weekiversary. Hold on. She's definitely not here. - Are you sure? - That's what she said. Bárbara! Bárbara! Bárbara, what's wrong? Bárbara! What's wrong? Why don't you come out to talk? Don't you want to be with me? Bárbara! Here. I got you the number of the minister's secretary. Thank you, Lu. I need that interview. I hope Ventoso gives me the green light. Now tell me, why do you think I'm... Lu? Lu? Renzo, this is my house. I can do whatever I want. Who's that bald man? A friend. - Want me to take your dinner upstairs? - That would be better. - Mom. - Hmm? Are you marrying him? What? And he is bold? Bald bastard. - Hey. - Let me see. It's for older than 35. Why do men only think about sex? I have no other option. Love runs away from me, or I just can't see it. I don't know if I should shower after that shit or throw up on your face. You should get a shower. Boss. According to the last poll, nobody reads your stories. I've been asked to make a new design for the newspaper's website in order to bring in new readers. - Do you know what a blog is? - No. I mean, of course, I know what a blog is. I've never had one, and it wouldn't work in the hypothetical case of having one, it wouldn't work. I can guarantee that. - Well, you're writing one. - A blog? No, idiot. A novel. - Of course I'm talking about a blog. - Really? And what it'll be about? Contemporary literature, Peruvian cinema? Not a chance. I hate Peruvian cinema. You have to write about love, Collazos. - Love? - Yes. About love. L is for Languish, O is for Oppression, V is for Vacuity, and E is for Egocentric. - That's love! - I know what love is, but I wouldn't feel comfortable writing about love. I'm a writer, I write about politics. In fact, I'm not a fan of technology. Look at my phone. Just worry about writing. Why me? - Are you single? - Yes. - Are you looking for women? - Not really. - Men? - No, I'm very manly. Why are you laughing? What I mean is that I'm not looking for anything. - We all look for something. Collazos. - Not me. Really. I swear, I'm good like this. From now on you're going to write a blog about relationships. Look in your memories. Do they have to be my stories? It doesn't matter. I can be your inspiration if you want. What are you still looking at? Do you want a picture of me naked? No, no, no... Forget it. Can it be anonymous? They're going to have your signature and your picture. Picture? Picture? Boss, what about the interview with the economy Minister? She just got the position and people need to know how much it's going to take to rebuild the south after the earthquake. We've spent the last two months talking about the earthquake. Just focus on your blog. Whatever you say, boss. One more bald... A blog about love? You? That must've been a joke. He said he wanted a writer. That's right. A joke. He said I meet the profile. - What? - Nothing. Nothing. Your boss has a good eye. Do you have a name for it? Is that a yes or a no? I have one but I won't tell you because you're going to laugh. You're one of those trashy friends. I won't laugh. I swear. Swear it on your mother's name. I swear for my beautiful mother, Chabela. Okay? Beautiful? Stop kidding. Here it goes. Looking for a girlfriend. - You're laughing. - No. You're laughing. Stop laughing because I need your drawings. This guy. Is there something else I have to do? There's money in it. When do we start? "Looking for a girlfriend." I like how it sounds. Five years in college. Summa Cum Laude. Chronicles, editorials, articles... only to become a relationship blogger. You're doing great. Stop it, idiot. Show me the picture. What's with that belly? And look how small I draw this. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm fine and you? Hey. Excuse me. He just wants your body, but I want your soul. Damn. Okay. That didn't work. "I want your soul" sounds like Dracula. Dear God. Your blog is going to be awesome. I can't wait. She begged me not to go with her gaze and to mitigate her agony, I said goodbye with a long kiss. Leaving behind a woman extremely satisfied, exhausted, ravished... What do think about that, Julio Ramón? Do you want a new failure? Okay. Hi, how are you? I'm Renzo, the foreskin guy. I just wanted to say that it's not a problem, I came here because of back pain. And the other thing is, you're a woman and I'm a man, and I was wondering if you'd like to go for a walk, get a coffee, get married... They did a good job with the circumcision. That's the nicest thing somebody has told me lately. You're so funny, patient Roberto. Thank you. But I'm Renzo. No, let me do that. This always happens with the ketchup packages too. Got it. - That way. - Hold on a second. - It's here! - Shh! Sweetie. Yes, I know. I don't like to fight either. Uh-huh. Where? In how long? Okay, see you there. Bye, kisses. That man you just talked to, do you have some kind of relationship with him? Yes, he's my boyfriend. What about us? So this was just a fling? We're not going to see each other again? If you need time, you should ask your boyfriend for it! Hey, you didn't pay for parking. Pay! Come on! QUIET! I just want to get an interview with the minister. Honey, talk to Ventoso. He's going to listen to you. I'll wait as long as you want. Okay. Tell me the good news, honey. Who are you calling honey? Does she read your blog? I'm sorry, boss. I told you it would fail. 605 comments in under 24 hours. Congratulations, Collazos. If we continue with these numbers we'll have the stockholders eating from our hands. She was wild, right? I knew choosing you wasn't a mistake. And just between us, did you fuck her? Collazos? Collazos! Yes, sure. That's my champ! - No one's stopping us now! - Thank you, sir. LOOKING FOR A GIRLFRIEND THE DOCTOR'S ASSISTANT 657 comments! I don't like how you write about girls. You make her seem as if she was a slut. Lu, you're always saying the same about treating men and women the same. - We are the same. - I know, Lu. You're right. I made a mistake, but it's not a big deal. - It's just a blog. - No, it's not just a blog. You know this is more than that. That's the Minister of Economy. I'll be right back. Mommy. I can't talk right now, I have a very important meeting with Ventoso. It'll be quick, sweetie. I'll come home late today. I left you some food in the oven that you can heat and a lemon tea for your gasses. Thank you, mommy. And don't forget to take the pills for your back pain - and do your exercises... - We have an agreement then. Talk to you later, bye. Dog? Did he give her a dog? That bald bastard is serious. They're a new continent and we have to conquer them. You'll see. What about the heat? It's awful. I felt sorry for the animals, they looked ugly and skinny. As if they haven't been fed. - Hi. - Hi. - Do you know him? - Baldie. - Do you know him? - What? Look at that. - Do you know him? - That's why I'm introducing myself. Okay, as I was saying, I saw the elephants... What are you doing? Having a conversation. And penguins too. They're pretty when they walk. You're very pretty. Thanks. - Beautiful. - Thank you. Gorgeous. Thank you. Have you read Hopscotch? Cheers. Oh, you don't have a drink. So weird. Too weird. It's too early for that. Almost got it. - Stop laughing. - It's just that... You did a great job. You made it. I'm so proud of you. I had to swallow my words. Baldie. Give us something strong, something that erases our memory. And I think they would want one of those too. BALDIE! GIVE US SOMETHING STRONGER Lu, you have to accept that women sometimes send signals as if you were interested but you're not. So now you're an expert on women just because you write a blog. No, I just give everything I have. I open my heart and most of the time nothing happens. We should act like in the animal kingdom. For example, when female giraffes want to lure the male giraffes, they pee. Swans turn their heads and sink their heads into the water. It's a clear signal, there's no confusion. It's instinctive. Okay, animal expert. - Imagine we go to dinner. - Okay. I'm wearing this blouse and I show a little bit of my bra. Would you say that's a signal that I want to sleep with you? Sure. Sure. And if while we're speaking in that same dinner I put my hair back like this, would you say that's another signal? I think so. And if there's a lot of noise in that place and I get this close so you can hear me. Would you say that's a signal? I think so. And if I get close to your... What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Weren't those signals that you want to be with me? No, it was a joke! But what kind of joke was that? I spent elementary school in love with Juliana Salazar because she let me borrow her erase and you do this? If she let you use her eraser is because she wanted to sleep with you. She was 11. Let me tell you that you haven't changed much. You know what? I'm going to ask the newspaper to get a new photographer - because you put me in a predicament. - I think that's great. Okay. I can't believe this. LOOKING FOR A GIRLFRIEND Julio Ramón. I'm blocked. What should I do, Julio Ramón? I admire you but not that much. Sweetie, you got some... This came for you. Look at the bright side. She's marrying the guy she cheated you with. That's good advice, asshole. - Goal! - No! When you need sex you can just masturbate. You're back to being yourself, a bit skinnier, but the same. But what do you do when you need love? How do you jerk off your heart? Hey, asshole. Jerk your heart off. Are you okay? - I can't hear you, what? - Are you okay? You almost destroyed my ear. If you go to this wedding you should bring someone because you're going to fall in love with anything that comes across. Thank you, man. Goal! Who can suck it? Who can suck it? Do you want a rematch or are you afraid of success? Do I know you from somewhere? Would you like to dance? Why are you alone? You drop a feather from your wings. Could I have an autograph? Excuse me, I thought you were Angelina Jolie. Aren't you Alejo's sister? I thought you were my ex. I made a bet and lost. Have you read Hopscotch? - Why is everyone so... - "Have you read Hopscotch?" - It's for emergencies only. - Did it work? No, how would that work? - Lu, I need your help. - You're hopeless. I don't know who helps the least you or Robot. Who calls himself "Robot"? Come to the wedding with me, please. So sweet. Is that a yes or a no? Lu. Are you coming or not? Answer me, Lu. Fernando Plaza, will you take Viviana San Miguel as your wife and promise to be faithful... If that were me this would be full. ...in good times and bad times, and respect her every day of your life? No. Let's move on. Fernando Plaza, will you take Viviana San Miguel as your wife? - No. - Shut up. Does someone have something to say? Penis. Please, Renzo. Don't embarrass me. Are you serious, Viviana? You're replacing me with your personal trainer? You're marrying someone who makes a living by doing pushes? - Push-ups. - Pushes. - Push-ups. - Pushes! - Pushes! Pushes! - Push-ups. - Push-ups. - Push-ups. - Stop embarrassing yourself and go. - What does he have that I don't? Independence. Attitude. His own business. Future plans. Many of them. But especially, his mom... lives in the countryside. Move. Move. But I have... love. Told you, Renzo. I told you this would be embarrassing. Fuck it. - No! No! - Viviana! But, Viviana... ¡Viviana, Viviana, Viviana! Viviana! Two years ago Viviana San Miguel broke my heart, and she had the great idea of picking the same date to get married. That's a relapse. VIVIANA! It's better that I didn't go to that wedding. Your boss will be glad. I don't understand why she invited me. She acted like an asshole. I think my name should be bigger on the drawings. It's a boomer, but why would she invite me when she knows her family will be there? People tend to look more at those drawings, although the stories are fine. I haven't asked for a raise because we're friends and who am I to ask for that? - I don't understand why she did that. - Hi. - Are you Renzo Collazo? - Yes, that's me. Ana Paula, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - How are you? - Baldie, one beer, please. I love how you make jokes about yourself in your blog. You've read my blog? Yes, of course. - Hi, how are you? - Hello. Yes, stay over there. How was it born? - Him? - No. - Your blog. - Oh, that was a natural birth. You're so funny, I love it. And what are you doing here? Having a good time, with you. How's your heart dealing with success? Don't look at me like that. I'm telling you this, so you become aware of what you're writing. - Would you come with to Alfredo's house? - I can't. - I haven't told you when. - I can't. But I'll give you three advices. Don't talk to them about your blog, don't fart because it's disgusting, and don't steal the soaps. I need new friends. Hey! I thought you wouldn't come. My romantic blogger. Who are you? Did you eat my friend? I'm not a curtain. Javiercito wakes up every two hours. And Alfredito walks around the house. In fact, we had to buy protection for the outlets because he could get electrocuted. We had to turn the living room into the baby's playroom. We've had to move the bar to the bathroom. Now I can drink and pee at the same time. Do you know to what school you're going to send him to? To Roosevelt, Newton, and Kohl, we still don't know. Why don't you send him to our school? He's bilingual as well. Where you haven't learned anything. What do you mean? Listen, the teacher is in the classroom. A blackboard is black. See? Our best student. Send him back to Pre-K. Do you have another cigarette? Of course. Mariana? I thought you wouldn't remember me. I haven't seen you since you were... - 14. - 14. You used... - Brackets. - Brackets. You went everywhere with your... - Guitar. - Yes, with your guitar. You have a great memory. - Do you still play? - Just a bit. I played for some time when I was living in Paris. That's right, your brother told me you went to study architecture. Yes. Four years. Wow. Why did you come back? And don't tell me you didn't like France. The Frenchmen. Parce que, mademoiselle? - Do you speak French? - Oui. Je parle français. A kiss from you would break the spell. I was just... I just remembered that you were a poet. I think my brother once gave a girl one of your poems as if he had written it. "No one likes you." Everybody used that poem. It never failed. Do you still write poetry? I'm writing a novel. But for now I am working as a Journalist for "El Comercio". So, what happened with the Frenchmen, or did you had a bad experience with one in particular? You haven't given me the cigarette yet but you're asking me this? You're right. Thank you. Hey, why don't we go somewhere else? Sure, we should go elsewhere. - Here it is. - Thank you. - Hey, Renzo! - How are you guys? - Hey, man. - Hi. - Hello. - What's up? My man, where are you going? Around. So, how's everyone doing? Hi. Baldie, a beer. You're famous. No. I just come often. I understand. So you're a drunk. You know what? What I love about this bar is that it's never out of fashion, although, it's never in fashion either. There's one like this in Paris, it's called La Belle belouise. Is there where you met your ex? - You haven't forgotten about it. - Of course. So you ended things because you were coming back to Peru? It's a bit more complicated than that. Is that right? And what do you write about in your blog? Well, a bit about the things that happen to me. I hope you don't write about our reunion. Why? I wouldn't like to be exposed to the opinion of others. I think that's aggressive. - Aggressive? - Yes. It's what writers do, right? Writing about their lives. Some writers. Well, I think I'm one of those writers. Don't you have imagination? What do you mean? When you've grown up next to the sea it's hard moving to a city without it. But you had the Seine river. At first, I loved walking next to the river. I thought I was in one of Riveiro's novels, like Juventud En La Otra Ribera. Do you know it? I know it by heart. - Would you marry me? - Yes. Yes, what? Yes, I was thinking about the song from the bar. - Yes. Yes. - Yes. - We're here? - Yes. What a shame. You're pretty. I've always thought you were pretty. Bye. We met again after ten years, and the chemistry is amazing. We haven't stopped talking ever since. Except for the part where you meet again, I've heard this story a bunch of times. No, Lu. - This time is different. - Come on, Renzo. You said the same about Viviana, Laura, Tiara, Jessica, - and Pablo... - What Pablo? Pablo doesn't exist. He kissed me. You closed your eyes. No, they were open. I should have closed them. If you really care about this girl then then take care of her. Don't be anxious because you always screw it up. Close your goddamned mouth. I have 15 minutes. I promise I'll go straight to the point. - What's your question? - I'm sorry. Well, It's obvious that after a tragedy like the one we've suffered, the people demand a clear, strong, and real answer about what you've done and what you are going to do about it. In that sense, how much of the GDP is going to be destined for the cities that were more affected by this earthquake? Immediately after the tragedy, we've destined a certain amount to help the cities that were affected the most by this earthquake and cover the basic needs of the people. We're working with different government departments to be more efficient and help to come as soon as possible. It feels amazing to be with an experimented woman, but how long can you deal with a woman's past? It's not the same to be her third boyfriend as her second. What happens if she has a more sexual experience than you? What happens if she tells you that she had a trio with two other guys? If you find out that she has systematically cheated on every boyfriend she's had? That before you came into her life she was just a free hippie or a porn star? You need to check her past, get her record of behavior, ask for criminal records, and if there's a large amount of experience. Records are a key indicator. People usually don't change and we're not only talking about the people she has been with, what happens if the girl has kids? You have to shut up about that. That's the thing. But why are you writing that? Not everything has to be a joke. Your life is a joke. What is wrong with that? - Do you really not notice? - Men think like that, don't we? That's how machistas, prejudiced, and childish men think. I think you're exaggerating. Okay, how do you want me to illustrate your "theory"? I don't know, you're the artist, right? You have a dumb face. Stop it. Hold on. I have an artist idea. Hello. Hello? I brought some cheese, some things for the lasagna, and a dessert. - Hi. - Huh. I thought it would be just the two of us, but don't worry there's enough for everyone. Where should I put this? - Here. - Here? Your apartment is nice. Thank you. And... where are the others? It'll be just the three of us. Why didn't you tell me before? I'm telling you now. Sure. - It's the Frenchman's kid, right? - Yes. Uh-huh. - You're married. - No, I'm not married. The Frenchman disappeared once he found out I was pregnant. Asshole. I tried raising her by myself, but you need help. That's why I came back. Renzo, I'm sharing this with you although it's very hard for me because I really like you. But I understand if a situation like this makes you uncomfortable and you don't want to keep seeing each other. But it's the whole package. Do you think I'm going to stop going out with you just because you have a son? A girl. - Oh, a daughter. - Claire. - Claire? - Yes. That's a beautiful name. Okay. We were going to cook, right? - Uh-huh. - How do we prepare lasagna for Claire? - With water? - No. Come, I'll teach you. Renzo, could you take care of Claire for a while? Okay. Ana? Are you okay? Are you sick? No. Can't I wake up early? You scared me. Come, let me get you some breakfast. I'll do some eggs, don't worry. What did you do? Don't do anything stupid, okay? Don't worry. Do you make scrambled eggs with oil? Yes? It's me, sweetie. Renzo? - What are you doing here? - Nothing. I was in the neighborhood, and I wanted to visit you. Can you open it? Sweetie? Okay. I want to have some time alone with you. It's just some wine. It's a good wine, it's... It's a Malbek from 1991. A good smell and body. So you know wines. The man who sold it to me said it. Okay. One glass, but just one because I need to work. Claire is excited about our trip to Lunahuaná. I've told her we'll see animals and nature. - Is she coming? - What did you think? - Of course. - Right. - Obvious. - Sure. Yes, you, me, and Claire. - Yes. - Hm-hmm. Renzo? Renzo? Renzo? Renzo? He's not here yet. - Hurry up. - I bought a toy. After leading the blog chart for months "Looking for a Girlfriend" is losing its readers. You're writing other's experiences. About dummies. It's not funny anymore. Okay, boss. Not everything has to be funny. The readers like to think too. Couldn't it be that it's true that you have a girlfriend? I knew it, that's the problem. Happiness is ruining you. We have to solve this. I know! Write about your relationship. People want to know about you. Impossible. Boss, Mariana thinks if I write about her it would be some sort of aggression and she would break up with me. Come on, Collazos. Put on your pants. Man up. What's important now is what you want. Love or the blog? - Hi. - Hi, sweetie. How are you? I'm fine. Just here, working. - What about you? - Have you been on the internet? - What? - Have you been on the internet? Sure. Why? Just asking. Have you been on the internet? Are you okay? Just normal stuff. Okay. Okay. Well... "Looking for a girlfriend" Too much sun for three. Oof! Already? Don't talk with your mouth full. Which one of my pictures are you going to show at your exhibition? I don't know if you deserve it anymore. You wrote about your relationship on the blog, right? She doesn't know. I know you. - And she won't read it. - What's wrong with you? Half Lima reads it. Yes, but she belongs to the other half. The intelligent one. I like how much you love it. That's the key to your blog success, except when you start throwing those crazy theories around. Thank you. You should've respected her decision. Ventoso put me between the wall and a hard place. - Don't kid yourself. - I'm not. You love having written about her. If you want you can take her to the exposition if she hasn't left you by that point. Let me introduce you to my best friend. Hurrah! Don't be silly. Pose. - Yeah? - It's me, Robot. Who's "me"? - Come on, man. Don't be stupid. - Is it you? I didn't recognize you, man. You have my respect. It's the first time you take responsibility for something. You can barely change your socks and now you want to change diapers. I love you too. I'm being serious. A woman with a kid is not just anything. Just keep playing. You don't like it when I tell you the truth. - What? - Listen, Robot. Do you know how you recognize your first love? It's when you're facing problems and all of the sudden you stop having so much... What's wrong, man? - You're choking. - Choking? Stop saying bullshit. Tell her that you're writing about her. What are you so afraid of? Having a fight? Couples fight, it's that easy. If you don't fight then you should start suspecting. But you have to seize this moment and have a really good fight. Bleed. And focus on something... reconciliation. No. Your girl is beautiful. You don't even know her. - No, but I can imagine. - Stop it. Okay. Are you still imagining her? - Yes, but now with her clothes on. - Damn. - Sweetie. - What's this? Just a detail. Thank you. It's beautiful. Well, have a seat. Well... I wanted to tell you something very important. Why so much mystery? Well, we've been dating for a while. - Just three months. - Those are details. And I've thought about us and our relationship. You're scaring me, Renzo. I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you. Thank you. Despite our arguments, our differences , and what might be on the blog, I love you. Hi, Renzo. - Could you sign me an autograph, please? - Sure. How couldn't I? - What's your name? - Viviana. And you must be Miranda, his girlfriend! Done. Could you bring me the check? - But you haven't ordered yet. - Miranda, his girlfriend? How was Lunahuaná? I love it. - It's full of mosquitoes, but it's nice. - Yes. Is it true that your daughter went canoeing? Yes. That's great. I'll bring you some wine so we can keep talking. You wrote about our trip? About me? About my daughter? - Didn't I tell you? - No. I think I was clear when I told you I didn't want you to do it. It's not so important. You shouldn't take it so seriously. I thought you would understand. I don't. I don't understand. It's your life with me and my readers want to know what happens to me. Your readers? Wow. I told you clearly that I didn't want you writing about me in your blog, and you still did it. You say you love me, but you have no idea what that means. And you know why? Because you're a selfish boy and I don't need a selfish boy, I need someone who respects my decisions. Decisions or conditions? What? You think it's easy to take responsibility for a child that isn't mine? You're an asshole. Don't be rude. I'm not being rude, Renzo. You're an asshole. What happened? Where's your girlfriend? Did she just leave? Tell me. Are you going to write about it in your blog? - What? - I'll be the first to see it. When is it coming? Tomorrow morning? You haven't ordered yet. Remember to mention me. Viviana with a V. I love you. I'll keep the flowers, okay? - What happened? - What are you doing here? I don't want to talk to you. - You called me. - That's right. What's this? You ruin me, kill me. You made me stand on the ledge and then pushed me. I was falling and you were like, "You should tell her, man." I don't talk like that, man. Oh. What did you tell her? She hates me. I know that, but what did you say? That doesn't matter. What does is that you killed me. It matters how you say it because it might change the result. I didn't want anything other than a person who listens to me. But I've realized that you're a selfish bastard. How did you tell her? I didn't tell her, the waitress did. How is that my fault? I was going to tell her. That thought about couples having to tell each other everything is wrong. It's an aberration. Imagine if they could read everything that we think or better said, everything that crosses our mind we said everything we think out loud. Directly. I'd be in jail, man. I love you. I'm dying for you. I'd love to make love to you, but I want to ask you to not take those socks off because your feet stink. Hey, baldie, bring us some drinks for my man. Here's your elixir, my friend. Made by the gods of alcohol so you shut up for a bit. - Just look at that. - I'm not kidding. I'm really not. Okay, should I wash them for you too? Asshole. Baldie, two more drinks, please. Professor. What are you doing here, Macarena? So this is the bar you always talk about. This is the one. Don't you have class tomorrow? You're talking like my dad. Don't spoil the fun and let's go dancing. Okay. Clear your mind. Anything... Let's go. - Hi. - Hi. Let me introduce you to Julio Ramón. Hi, Julio Ramón. Nice to meet you, I'm Denisse. What's your friend's name? Sure. Don't tell me, don't tell me. Renzo Collazos, the one with the blog. How exciting. Julio Ramón speaks highly of you. - Is that right? - Yes. Good. Have you read Juventud En La Otra Ribera? - What? - Nothing. Forget about it. Why don't we dance? NO ONE DARES TO JUMP Good morning. Good morning! How are you? What happened, Cinderella? How's the princess? Hold on. What happened yesterday? Before or after you threw up? That's why my throat hurts. It was bad. You drank a lot. In fact, you were a bit intense. Just like always, but a bit extra this time. Those were my students, man. You were saying, "Come to see a movie with us. Where are you going? Don't get mad!" GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN I'm not listening to you this time, Julio Ramón. Not this time. When I was dating your dad there was a day when I went out alone. I wanted to have fun and feel young again. Your dad was 20 years older than me. We went to a bar called "hiccups." I drank the whole bar. I was happy, dancing, and this guy showed up who asked me, "From what beehive do you come from, honey?" I never forgot about it because I thought it was very stupid. But I still talked to him. My friends left and I stood there with him until sunrise. I had a lot of fun. And two weeks later I married your father. You cheated on my dad? You haven't understood anything. There was a guy, the hiccups, now explain the rest. Okay. In life, you have to make decisions and the consequences of what you choose will follow you around your entire life. As time goes by decisions are harder to take and you have to make sacrifices. THE INVISIBLE SIGHT You're Renzo's friend, Robot, right? Bee-bop. Welcome. I hope all you've heard about me is 100% negative. It was a great story the one with Macarena and Denisse. What did this idiot write now? Basically, a teacher spends the entire night partying with his students. Is that true? Don't you make the drawings? Yes. I just didn't think he'd talk about it. He lied to you? Son of a bitch. Lu, congratulations. This... this... this. Robot. Why did you write that? They're my students. I could get fired. I had to send something, and I couldn't come up with anything else. Is that your excuse? I'm sorry. Okay, it's not a big deal. It's that easy, right? I'm destroyed, okay? Grow up, asshole. Come on. - Come on. - No. The world doesn't move around you. You're the only one to blame for all your relationships failing. You're incapable of stepping out of your comfort zone. Why did you lie to your friend? And she asked you to not write about her. Why did you? I have a lot of new ideas for new blogs, Collazos. The success of Looking for a girlfriend has opened new doors with the board. We're doing great! Listen, can I tell you a story, so you publish it as your own? Sure. Of course. Then come tomorrow so we can talk. In the meantime, work on what I asked you to do. Boss. Did you always know you wanted to be a journalist? No. I came to journalism by mere chance. I wanted to be a writer. But working in journalism is the logical path to becoming a writer. Have you written something? It's not done yet. REMEMBER FROM HIS WIFE AND RENZITO Thank you, man. RENTING OUT Yes? It's me, open. It's 8:30 a.m. What do you want? We have to talk. - Is it urgent? - Don't make it difficult, just open it. Okay, I'm coming out. Why can't I go in? No, I'm coming out. What do you want? Get out. No. Please, come out. Okay, enough. You might fall in love if you don't stop. Now say it. But I hugged you. Be serious. Say it. I'm sorry. Asshole. Let's go inside. - Why inside? No, no, no. - Let's go eat. No, hold on. Hold on. Let me go first. I think he has to try again. No, I think he needs to be alone. This writer by himself? He's not a writer, he's a novelist. - Okay. - I agree. Do you? I like it when you agree. Whatever you say. It's confirmed, I lost my friend. No, man. I'm not like you. Of course not. You're there with the arms, the leg, and that idiot gaze. Lu bites you and doesn't let go. Hey, I'm still here by the way. Yes, you're here. You're here with me. Look at those lips. - And those eyes. Your forehead. - Disgusting. Hey, what's wrong with you? You're such an asshole, look at yourself. Calm down, I'm not taking your throne, man. José Luis Peráles. You two are like my brothers. Okay, to what I'm here for. I need you to help me. To do what? I'm like a third-division player. I made my best goals in a dusty field in the suburbs among four drunken fans who don't remember a thing. Riveriro is such amazing. If you keep reading we're going to end packing when Peru qualifies for the World Cup. Whoof. Someday. We have to have faith. We should throw this rag out, right? No, put it in my bag. Everything in here has a history. Viviana, Trigal's fair, Christmas 2005. Jessica, summer of 2002, octopuses. Kiara, 1999, Fortuna Hotel, second reconciliation. It still hurts. Listen, fetish idiot, you have to throw that out and not keep it in the closet. I keep my things too. I have a memory of my first boyfriend in elementary school, one or two boyfriends from high school. Some friends with benefits I had. - I tried but I couldn't. - Okay. Look, I can give you this. They all fit in here, right? No. I need an entire truck. Lucía one, Robot 0. What? The truck is waiting. I'm going to take this one. Anyone would say you're kicking me out. No, sweetie. How can you think about it like that? She's kicking me out. Well, I don't give him more than two weeks. I don't even give him a week. Thank you. Let's go, Julio Ramón. Hurry up, Renzo! Okay, I'm coming. FRAGILE Come on, it's just clothes. - Hi. - Hi. Have a seat. You look amazing. - Thank you. - How are you? Fine and you? I resigned from the newspaper. Congratulations. Do you know what a tagadá is? - What? - Tagadá. It's a mechanical game. Some sort of metal disc that goes around its axis. People hold on to not fail in the center, but the ones who fell in the center are usually the ones having the best time. They're hurt, but they don't stop laughing. It's really funny and at the same time, it's intense. I think our relationship was something like that. What do you mean? I could've taken a risk. I wanted to, but I held on to my blog, my comforts. I was very afraid about facing the men, I mean, the child that I still am with the man who I want to be. But you, instead, you did it. You took a chance without fear. You don't have to explain. In a way, I also had this idea in mind about being with my brother's friend who I always liked. But I'm not that teenager either. Well, we weren't going to get married or anything. Renzo. YEARS LATER... Yes, mom. I told you I have the book showcase. You can bring me a copy of that later. Where are you? Yeah! What are you smoking? I miss you, sweetie. - I love you so much. - Renzo, they're waiting for you. - No one's here. - No, it's this way. Oh. I'll be there, thank you. Mom? Mom? Mom? I have to go, some people are waiting for me. I miss you, honey. Me too, mom. Me too. Kisses! THE ONLY SON - Thank you very much. - Take a seat. Well, good evening. I'd like to present the first book by Renzo Collazo. Third one. The third one, that's right. Renzo's third book. Let's see. This book seems pretty personal. Tell me, how much of you is reflected in this novel. Well, every author... I'm sorry. Every author thinks highly of themselves, and I don't mean this stops being fiction, but we see literature as autobiographical. If someone says otherwise, they're lying. And there are a lot of examples that prove this. Without going too far, Julio Ramón Riveiro, his book is about the things that happened in his life. So, yes. I was looking... It's been a long time since I was in charge of the "Looking for a girlfriend blog". In the following years, I wrote a storybook that no one bought. Then I published a suspense novel which apparently reached its goal, the critics called it "a real intrigue." I've reread many times the texts I wrote for that blog, some of them seem naive, others are violently machistas. Lucía was right, the world moves on and we have to change as well. But it takes some time, a lot in fact. In the years when I was looking for a girlfriend, I lived with my mother and after Mariana, I had another girlfriend who broke my heart and I'm sure I broke hers too. The relationships are like this, sooner or later someone is hurt. Sometimes both of them. I've been alone for a long time and it's great like that. I lost my suit to look for a girlfriend a while ago. Thank you. Could you sign it for Susana? Of course. - Thank you. - Thank you. WITH LOVE FOR RICARDO CABELLOS
