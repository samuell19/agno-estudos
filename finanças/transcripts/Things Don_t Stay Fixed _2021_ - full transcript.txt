Ladies and gentlemen, the fasten seat belt sign has been switched off at this time. We would like to suggest the use of your seat belts... Good morning, Sleepy Town. You're listening to 88.5, coming to you from across the tracks in beautiful downtown Columbus, Georgia. Oh. Sam Grace, you handsome, son of a gun. Thought you never were gonna get your butt out of bed. How you doing, gorgeous? I'm so glad to see you. You know Nina's gonna have a fit you getting here and her gone. Mornin', Nathan. You ready for breakfast, honey? Well, what's the matter? You hungry or not? Just trying to remember the last time that somebody called me honey. You want cheese in your grits? Yes, ma'am. Is Kate already gone? Oh, Lord yes. Ever since old Doctor Sims retired, she does all the surgery. Most mornings she's gone before I even get up. Kate loves those animals. Oh God, these are sweet. I know. Aren't they good? Mm. Kate won't eat 'em. She's given up sugar. You know Kate. Always giving up something. First it's cigarettes, then it's caffeine, then chocolate. And now she's talking about white flour and salt. Pretty soon, she won't be able to eat anything I know how to cook. You want sorghum with those biscuits? You got sorghum? Uh-huh. No, let's save it for tomorrow. Those figs'll probably put me in a coma. That's what happens you go North. You lose your tolerance for sweet things. Everybody up there's kinda lean and hungry lookin'. Yeah, well, where I've been isn't North. It's, um, South. And everybody is lean and hungry. Mm. You know I got Nathan getting that old rose trellis out of the shed. It's in good shape, just needs a coat of paint. Course it won't have any roses growing on it. Agnes, there is not going to be a wedding. Oh, there's gonna be a wedding, honey. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but that's done decided. And Nina wants you to give her away. Will you? No. No, I'm not giving her away. And I mean, for God's sake, I can't believe you and Kate are going along with this. Well, you want me to cancel that tuxedo? Why would a beautiful, talented, 20-year-old girl with her whole life in front of... They're in love. So what? They're older than you and Nancy were. The last time I talked to her, she didn't mention to me anything about getting married. The thought never crossed her mind. And when was that? I don't know. Christmas. Mm, things happen. Not this wedding. Shit. Is she pregnant? Of course she's pregnant. Why else would she be getting married? It's my dad. Daddy! I knew you'd come. When did you get here? Hi, baby. Come meet Chris. Look, we need to talk. I know. We will, but I want you to meet Chris now. You're gonna love him. Baby, we're smarter than this. Smarter than what? I'm... Than to pull a stunt like this. A stunt? I'm... I'm getting married! The hell you are. The hell I am. Who the hell do you think you are? Your father. Thanks for reminding me. Look, Nina, I wasn't expecting you! Maybe I started this wrong. Nina! Just... Nina! Telegram said you were getting married, that was bad enough. I could have put a stop to that. Really? Then Agnes tells me you're pregnant. Sometimes Aggie has a big mouth. Look, you don't have to get married. There are other... What? No, Daddy. There are not other alternatives. There's one alternative. An abortion? Is that what you're saying? An abortion? Yes. Yes, Nina, that is what I'm saying. I know it's an awful choice, but you are so young. You have your whole life in front of you! Look, I'm shooting the Olympic trials this summer. You can go with me. We can have this taken care of in a week! I can't believe this. I mean, if you and my mother had done what you're suggesting I do, I wouldn't exist. That was different. There are clinics now. You don't even have... I have to take a shower. Chris is picking me up. Sam! Hells Angels come back, I will... You mean Chris? He goes to Duke. I don't care where he goes. Nina can go anywhere she wants. She can go to the fucking Sorbonne if she wants. How much did she tell you? That she's pregnant and she's getting married. She wants to have the baby. She's just a baby, Kate. I could have given her anything. She can have anything she wants. I think she got what she wants. She's 20 years old, Kate. Nancy knew what she wanted. What? To marry Sam Grace and have his baby and to love him the rest of her life. And she did. Well, that's not much to aspire to. Bye, Aunt Kate! I'm gone. We'll be late. It's every girl's dream. Yours too? Yep. Yeah, it was. I mean, I got distracted by other things along the way. Like anthrax and heartworms. When I was growing up, I thought I was gonna get married, too. Have a husband that loved me. I guess that's what girls think they need to be a woman. Boys don't think they need a wife to be a man, though, do they? No. Lucky. What does a boy need to be a man? A car. He needs a car. I'm up anyway. I can just as easy come out here and start those sprinklers than lay up in bed looking at the ceiling. I'm the yard man. I can get here early and get the watering started. Do I look helpless to you? Never been a time when I seen the law get involved in watering. It's a drought, Nathan. We got a global problem here. Only thing that grows by their selves is weeds. Hmm. You know, I thought this thing looked better when we took it down. It did. But that was 20 years ago. Well, it hasn't been doing anything but laying up in the shed. Don't matter. Things don't stay fixed. They don't? No, you gotta keep coming back to 'em. Mm. Well, did you find that cradle out there? It's around here somewhere. It probably needs fixing too. Mm-hmm. Oh, hey. Good morning. Oh. Morning, Nathan. You ready for breakfast, honey? Not this morning. I gotta go. Where you going? I need a car, Agnes. You're wasting your time, Nathan. There's not gonna be a wedding. Hmm. You hear that? Mm-hmm. Miriam! Hello, Miriam. Sam! Want a ride? Too many miles to get there in a car. What's that? Miles. Too many miles? Yeah? To where? You ain't going. Well, I could be. Not in a car you can't. Let me out, stop here. Miriam, we're not near anything. Stop this car! You trying to kidnap me! You want my hair! I'm pulling over, I'm pulling over. What's mine is mine! It certainly is. Everybody is always everywhere. Everybody is always everywhere. Yeah, y... take... can you just... the door, Miriam! Everybody is always everywhere! Everybody always everywhere! Come on, gorgeous. Your chariot awaits. What do you think? I love it. Beautiful, isn't it? Oh, gorgeous. Wait 'til you see how fast she goes. Ooh-ooh, let's go as fast as she can. Let's do it, baby. Hold on. So how do you like it? What? How do you like it? Oh, it's wonderful. Any place special you wanna go to? The cemetery. What? The cemetery. You said anyplace I want, I hadn't been out there since Easter. You know I haven't ever been back there. Well, then it's high time you went. Anything hadn't been done in 15 years is something that needs doing, so let's go do it. No telling how long it'll be before you're back here again. Oh, I thought- Like what we did with Nancy's tombstone? Yeah, it's nice. Mm. Kate picked it out. Told her what to put on it. I think it suits Nancy. She was always singing that little song. I'm I'm glad Kate thought to have it on there. It's how I like to remember Nancy. Simple and free? Mm, Uh-huh. Like a gift. Oh, Sam, Nina isn't Nancy, I know she looks just like her, but nothing's gonna happen to Nina. I know they look just alike. That child's gonna live forever. Nobody lives forever, Ag. Oh, I might. I keep on getting replacement parts, I might just keep on going 'til my brain dries up. Ooh. I gotta go pee. There's a Chevron up the road. No, no, I'll just go in the bushes over here. I'll be right back. Hi. That your people there? Huh? Um... yeah. Mama? Daddy? No, it's, uh, my wife. Not a very big marker. My baby brother has a bigger marker than that one. Your baby brother's buried here? No, not here. Too rich for us. Over at the Bethal Church Cemetery. He had the whooping cough. I'm... I'm sorry. How about your wife? What'd she die of? Uh, she... she fell. Out a window? No, it was off a mountain. Whoo! How tall was she? Five foot three. See there? Where that foot marker's is, makes her look like she's tall. Want me to move it for you? Um... I'll do it for a dollar. Uh, no, no thanks. Grave diggers ought to pay some heed to how tall the bodies is. People like to remember folks like they were. Not all the same. You sure you don't want me to move that footstone. Set you wife back to her actual height? Um, well, okay, sure. Won't take but a minute. Boy, this one's in tight. You do this a lot? How long it been here? Fifteen years. Can you help me out a little? Uh... Well, here, let me... let me try. Alright. Okay. Now, okay. That look about right for her? Yeah. Good. Five three ain't five ten. Any fool knows that. Oh, uh... Thank you. Thank you. Oh, and your shovel. Thanks. Hey, uh, can... I... I take your picture sometime? You got a Polaroid? What's your name? I'm William. William White. Where can I find you? We're out here most every afternoon. Except Saturdays. Saturdays we go out fishing at the dam. Everybody knows me. William White. Harley, go clean up the gravel around there. Do you believe what happened? Sam Grace, I love you. You know what those boys do, don't ya? Yeah, they move markers for people. Uh, they steal flowers. That's why I don't bother bringing 'em anymore. They just get stole. I'll tell you one reason he'll stay and give her away. What? To keep Ben Partee from doing it. Mother, why don't you like Ben Partee? Oh, I like him. I never said I didn't like him. I just don't like talking to him. Do you? No. Look at this. Aggie. Ooh. It's beautiful. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Mm. Me too. No, I'm... I'm not going to do this if it's gonna upset you. Oh, I'm not upset. Your mama was the prettiest bride I've ever seen when she walked down the aisle in this dress. And you will be too. What about you, Aunt Kate, do you think I'm doing the right thing wearing Mother's dress? Of course you're doing the right thing. I'll be right back. I gotta look at my pies. Let's try it on. Ooh, look at this. Oh, it's okay. Oh. You sure run a lot. I try to stay in shape. You look pretty good. Thanks. You're welcome. I used the, uh... the zoom lens when we were on Cumberland. You did? Yeah. I think I got some pretty good shots of a wild pony on the beach. Was he moving? Mm-hmm, and it was just at sunset. Lot of clouds. Great light. Film or digital? Film. Good. You develop them yet? Hmm-mm. Well, I'd like to see them when you do. I taught you everything you know. Well, everything I know. I, um... I think I'm gonna try to get some freelancing work when we go back to Duke this fall. Well, until the baby comes, I mean. It's tough to break into... freelancing. Isn't that how you got started? I wasn't pregnant. Mother was. So, what was a wild horse doing running on the beach? Not a horse. A pony. Oh. Didn't you ever go to Cumberland Island when you were in high school? No, we went to Daytona Beach. Chris loves Cumberland. We like to go camping. You know, I saw them catch a 15-foot great white on the pier at Daytona once. On the pier? Yeah. It took all night. Around dusk, they paddle out in these little lifeboats and they set the hooks. Then they just go back on up and wait. When that shark strikes... they just keep playing him for hours 'til they finally wear him down. And they just hoist him on back up. I'd never seen anything so huge come out of the ocean before. And the next day I went back, because I just had to see it again. Was it still there? Not on the pier. It was in the sand. They had cut its jaws out and left the rest. Flies were swarming all around it. I mean, I mean I couldn't believe it. All that life I saw coming out of the sea. And all that life was just 15 feet of dead meat. With these flies all over it. Where did all that life go? Are you still leaving before my wedding? I'm still hoping you call it off. I won't. I have to tell you something about Chris. Mwah. You know, Dad, you can't run from everything. BEN PARTEE You know, I have not had lamb like this since the last time I was in France. And we all know about the French. They like their lamb rare. In the South, we're a little afraid of the rare lamb. It's hard for us to even think of lamb as lamb, isn't it? We get it confused unconsciously with pork. And we have a memory in our... well, somewhere. In our In our bones, our solar plexus, uh, our lower intestines, somewhere very deep down, we have a memory that tells us that we do not eat pork unless it is well cooked. Right, we don't eat pork rate. But lamb's not pork. No, it's not beef either, but it's not pork. And yet we seem inclined to associate it with pork, so we're a little uncomfortable eating lamb even on the pink side. But But not the French. Oh no, not the French. They love their lamb, rare, bloody even. Well, you just go ahead and give Chris some more, 'cause he loves his lamb. Are all the ladies served? We are. All right, Chris, here you go, young man. Now, Samuel, I know you'd preferred the French style if we had it, wouldn't you? We don't have it. I thought your name was Samson. Looks great, but I'm not really into the French. Ah, the French. They are the genuine article. Would you get some more rolls, too, while you're in there? Thank you, honey. So, you went all the way to Cumberland Island and back on a motorcycle? Uh-huh. Well, minus the ferry, of course. Jesus Christ. Are you trying to kill my daughter? No, sir. I don't go very fast when she's on the bike. I'm very careful with her. It's okay. Fine thing for you to be talking about this, Sam Grace, with that racing car of yours out there. The Corvette is yours? It's a beauty. Yeah, thanks. Where are you planning on going with that? I'm planning on driving to California. You wanna go? Oh, no thank you. I'm getting married. Mm. So, Chris, you like fast things? I guess I do. When I was a little girl, I wanted to have my own plane. Like Amelia Earhart. What about you, Kate? What'd you wanna be when you were little? Ginger Rogers. Of course. That's my girl. She'd rather dance on an airplane than fly one. You know, maybe we could fly. I mean, maybe we can already, we just don't know it. How do we find out? Not be scared. Of flying? Of anything. I mean, I think it's being scared that keeps you from being light enough to take off in the first place. I mean, fear has a heavy density. And it takes a lot of lightness to fly. Hollow bones. Mm-hmm. You know, could be that when we're all made out of artificial parts, we would be light enough. They got some real lightweight plastics now. Oh, Mama, you would like to fly then, I see? Honey, I would love to. I heard they're training Salvadorians at Fort Benning. Mama, why do you repeat those tales that Miriam makes up? I believe Miriam. She knows more than we do. Don't the ETs live in Miriam's hair? No, her sisters from Saturn are her hair. Um, Chris and Miriam are friends. She talks to him. I talk to her, too. Would she ride in a car with you? Uh, no, I don't think she would. No, no, it isn't. I just... I'm afraid that it's gonna be too hard on you. Spending all that time working on Nancy's wedding dress. What about Nancy's wedding dress? Aggie's altering it for me to wear for the wedding. You won't be there. No, I won't. I don't give a shit. Mm. It's all in the soil with wine. Just like with the Vidalia onions. The soil tells the tale. The soil gives life. How you like the wine, Sam? Uh, I like it. It's good. It's, um... daring. The heat'd kill 'em anyway. But even in cool weather, it just doesn't make any sense to take fresh flowers out there. Those Mill Town boys just come out there and get 'em and they take 'em and sell 'em to cut-rate florists. They're just trying to make a buck. Sam paid 'em good money to go digging around Nancy's grave. What are they doing on Nancy's grave? They just set her back to her rightful height. What? Look, Kate, it's nothing. They didn't hurt anything. Oh, I'd love to take gladiolus... at least on Easter or Christmas. But as long as those boys are out there, there's just no point to it. Their name's White. Harley and William White. And I like William. He is a smart kid. God damn. Probably wind up being a fucking senator one day. Well, I am stuffed. I'm not stopping, but I'm stuffed. Now, Nina, can't you convince your aunt to make this, uh, a double ceremony Saturday? No, thank you. I am too old to be sharing the stage with this one. Excuse number 45. I tell you, friends, I... and, Samuel, I'd be happy to have your advice on this. I have run out of ideas to get this lady to marry me. I've done everything I know. As our friend, Mr. Eliot says, "Though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed"... Have you? What's that? Have you? Wept and fasted, wept and prayed? Well, in a manner of speaking, of course. See, I don't think it's a manner of speaking at all. I don't think it's a manner of speaking. I think it's absolutely fucking literal. I have wept and I have fasted. And I have wept and I have prayed. Real tears, real deprivation. Real down on your knees pleading to God. So, I don't think you've wept or prayed for Kate. As a matter of fact, I know you haven't fucking wept and prayed for Kate. Sam, you're making a fool of yourself. You know how I know you haven't, Ben? You know how I know you haven't wept and fasted, wept and prayed? No, Samuel, how do you know that? Because she's not married. See, Kate is a strong woman, but she is not impervious to the will of God. Well, I don't flatter myself that my prayers would affect the will of God. No, yours wouldn't. I guess you think yours would. It did one time. When I was seven. I was living down in Jackson, Mississippi. This was before my mother married my stepfather. And one Sunday night, I prayed for it to snow. "It doesn't snow in Jackson, Mississippi," my mother said. And I said, "I don't care, I want some. I'm going to pray to God that it snows." She says, "God won't answer that prayer. God doesn't answer selfish, silly prayers from selfish, silly boys. "And I said," I bet he does. I bet God answers my prayer." And I never doubted one second that he wouldn't. And I knew that sometime that week... it would snow in Jackson, Mississippi. And did it? One Thursday morning I woke up and I looked out the window, the whole ground was covered. It was still coming down. They canceled school. And I played outside in that snow all day long. It does snow in the South. It's, uh... it snowed here in '22 and again in '73. So, it happens. God answered your prayers. I believe that time he did, when I was seven years old. There's been other occasions where I have asked God for things, and he hasn't responded. There have been other occasions where I have wept and I have fasted, and I have wept, and I have fucking prayed, and God did not respond! See, I think God only responds to the pure at heart. Not to old sinners like you and good ol' fucking Samson! It was delicious, Agnes. No, no, no, Mom, you sit still. We'll get it. It's fine. Come On. I didn't know, uh, Daddy grew up in Mississippi. Did you, Aggie? There's a lot we don't know about your daddy, honey. What year is your Corvette? Seventy-nine. The Shark was the best look they ever had. Later ones are faster. The Shark was the best. Uh, my cousin had an '82. Great car, except you couldn't see anything behind you. He wasn't interested in that. God, I could fucking kill you for getting my daughter pregnant. I'd love to drive it sometime. You know, back in my day, I'd have the right to shoot you. I mean, what galls me is you don't even seem sorry. I apologize. For what? For Nina being pregnant, that's what you're mad about, isn't it? No, I'm mad at you getting Nina pregnant. I didn't. What do you mean? She did it. She tricked me into letting her get pregnant. But you were there. Yeah, I was there. You little shit. Uh... Yeah, yeah. You drive that like a pro. Thanks. I raced a little. Yeah? Yeah, just small ones. Charlotte, Taladega. I got certified. No kidding. Mm-hmm. Anywhere special I should go, or...? Just drive. There's a cow in the middle of the goddamn road. We could be dead. We could be. Alright, let's see if we can coax her off the road. Hi. You want some forgiveness? Cows are very forgiving animals. Were you there? When your wife fell? Yeah, I was there. Did you actually see her? Fall? We were on a picnic on Mount Placid. She'd been picking wildflowers up on this hill. Nina was with me. And I looked up and... Nancy was coming down the path, her arms full of these flowers. Sunshine was pouring all over her. I waved to her. She saw the camera and she started laughing. That sunlight on her. She was radiant. Yeah, I don't know exactly how it happened because I was looking through the camera. That path wasn't that steep. But I guess a rock slipped or she stumbled. And it happened in that camera like I was seeing a movie, frame by frame. Her startled face. Flowers in the air. There was a second when my... finger kept snapping, before my mind knew what was happening. I I photographed my wife falling to her death. Jesus, look at that. Hi, there! What you doing? Shining this light. Yeah. She's a beauty. What's the occasion? No occasion. Mighty bright, ain't it? It sure is. You're just shining it for no reason? That's right. It don't signify nothing. Shining for its own self. You mind if we stay and watch? Make yourself at home. Stars are pretty tonight, ain't they? Yeah. She was in a coma for three days. You pray for her? Yeah. I pray. You still got it? The picture? Yeah. Can I see it? Never really showed anybody before. Kinda weird. What? Oh, man. What? She's flying through flowers. She's not flying, she's falling. No, she's flying. See? No fear. Sky full of flowers. She is flying. Alright, where to next? My mom's. I'll get you there. You think she's up? Yeah, she's up. We usually talk about it, but this confirms that Jesus... Hello, mama. May I come in? Who is he? He your kid, too? Yeah, he's one of mine. I'm Chris. How are you, Mother? Like you care. You can't buy my forgiveness, you know. I don't wanna buy your forgiveness, I just wanna make sure you're alright. Hmm. Would you do what your daddy did? Run off and leave your mama with a drunkard? I begged you to leave him. I couldn't stand it anymore. Well, he's dead now. Burning in everlasting hell for his sins. And I pray that you'll repent yours before it's too late. Mama I do ask the Lord to forgive me. And I asked you to forgive me for not being a very good son. And I forgive you for never wanting me, and for never loving me even one day. And I forgive both of us for being thrown into this world together and not being able to save ourselves. I will not be coming to see you again. I will not see you another time. You hear that? He loves his sin more than he loves the Lord. For Samson has a weakness for the Philistine harlot. His lust is greater than his love of the Lord. Come on, Chris, let's go. God took your wife to punish you. He took my wife because she was an angel and he wanted her to come home. He set her free so she could fly to heaven with flowers all around her. Don't you mock God. Goodbye, Mother. You know you can't buy me off with those checks, I give 'em all to the church. But it won't be enough to save you, you were born a child of sin and so you shall remain! You alright? Hey. Hi. I decided to stay for the wedding. Great. I'll give you away if you still want me to. Okay, Daddy. Uh... He's gonna give me away. That's great. Did you tell him about you last night? No. You didn't? No. Huh. Then... why did he change his mind? I don't know. I was thinking about telling him about me. Mm-hmm. Uh, then he... he told me he could have me killed for getting you pregnant. Oh, no. Then I said, you know, "She tricked me into it." That was gallant. And then he called me a little shit, so... That was my moment, huh? Mm-hmm. "Well, sir, you see, the reason your daughter "got herself pregnant, so that we'd have to get married "is because... well, the doctors told us there's a good chance I'm not long for this old world." Hey. I'm really not up for the "What's so bad about dying?" conversation this morning, Chris. Kate says it's not fair to not tell him the truth. She's right. But you should tell him. Hi, Daddy. Idn't she a picture? Yes. Okay, I think we've got it. Am I done? I can go? Gon' be the prettiest bride I ever saw. Daddy, you need a haircut. You are just so pretty, so beautiful. Thank you. I remember the first dance he took Nancy to. Showed up all scrubbed and beaming, carrying that white gardenia wrist corsage. And wearing a tuxedo with white socks. So I had some rough edges, but I was still irresistible. He was. I love you, Daddy. I love you, too. Hey. Whew. Oh, you want a cup of hot tea, honey? Yes, ma'am, please, thank you. What am I missing? You can tell old Ben Partee that we will not be needing his services no more. You're staying? I am staying. Oh. Good. I found it, Nathan. How much of that paint you got left? This paint got lead base, don't use no lead-based paint on no baby's crib. Alright, then, you are the boss. Sit tight! Well, I'm just making sure you're not messing up. What do you think, boy? What do you think? He's gotta know about Chris. Honey, if I knew how to help you, I would. Hi. Ordered my tux already. Great, um... I have to tell you something. Sure. Then the bride and her father will come from the back of the church, down the aisle. I wish that groom would hurry up and get here. Nina, I'm afraid we're going to have to go ahead, dear. I have another rehearsal in half an hour at First Methodist. Alright. I don't know where Chris could be. Uh, Kate, you should precede them by ten feet. Mark it off. Alright, everybody ready? Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God in the presence of these witnesses. When that part is finished, I'll say, "Who gives this woman to be married to this man?" That will be you, Mr. Grace. You'll reply, "I do." Oh, uh, I do. And as soon as you've given the bride away, you can go and have a seat right over there, next to Ms. Hampton, but, uh, if you don't mind, just for the moment, could you stand in for the groom? Oh, why don't I stand in for Chris? Nah, it's... it's okay. It's just a rehearsal, after all. But Nina, I'm counting on you to make sure Chris knows exactly what is expected of him. Yes, ma'am. And then we'll say our vows. I understand the two of you have composed something. Uh, Chris has it. Reverend Lewis! Reverend Lewis! What's the matter, Clark? It's Miriam, Reverend Lewis. She's out in the middle of the dam, yelling like a crazy person. Chris is out there trying to get her back. They didn't have no sister like Miriam, and no sweet mama to save them, and so they drowned 'em all in the river Nile! But the sweet sisters of Saturn, they came out of Miriam's hair, and then they took out they hair. And they took all the baby boys into they hair! And then they placed them in the arms of Jesus! And then they flew them all to Saturn. And when the baby boys woke up, they laughed into the heavens, and they swam into the rings of Saturn while their sisters made them garments of gold. But you know, those other baby boys, they drowned. And Moses' mama said, "I don't care what Pharaoh say, they ain't gon' drown my baby boy, I'mma save my baby." And his sweet sister Miriam, she loved him, and she gave her hair... She's gonna hurt herself. She's gonna jump. Will she jump? Miriam, come on. Let's go. She said, "I can find somebody to take care of that baby, you want me to do that?" Miriam, it's okay. It's okay. Let's go. She got her mama to help take care of that baby. And Miriam, that baby was saved. She's gonna jump, sir. She needs to be saved. She's gonna jump. She needs help. She needs to be saved. She needs to go to a mental hospital. Nina, stay back, stay back, stay back. Daddy, don't let anything happen to him. She needs to be helped. We lifted up all those other baby boys they had drowned in the river. We all lifted him at the clouds, and we took 'em home. so they could swim and swim in the rings of Saturn! They were saved! And then they are weary. It's me, Miriam. It's me, Miriam. Oh, my God, Sam! Draw out the child! Draw out the child! Draw out the child! Draw out... draw out the child. Draw out the child. Tomorrow? Alright. What time? Okay. And the... parents. Yours is in the dining room. My what? Tux. And the shoes too? Uh-huh. Well, can't we just do it over the phone? I'm sorry, it's policy, sir. Okay, I'm gonna have to come over right now. We have to order it today. Right. Okay. Bye. Where are you going? You've gotta get yourself dressed. I won't be long. You've gotta get dressed for the wedding. Be right back. Shit! Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going? Funeral home, bring my clothes to the church. Sam! Oh, God. Mm-mm-mm. Sam! Chris! I like this one. It seems a little bit fussy for William, I think he would like this. It's pretty, it's soft. You really like that one? I do, I mean, it's not too fussy, it's just the brass, it looks comfortable. Ah, Mr. Grace. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. I understand you're in something of a hurry. Yeah, we've got a, uh, wedding. Yeah. And you're taking charge of the arrangements for little William White? That is truly generous, I must say. Have we selected a casket for little Will? Yeah, um, I think this one. Ah, the Birch Master. A tasteful choice. This one is very popular for our younger loved ones. How much is this one? About the same. There's very little difference between the two, if you prefer the Dresden Oak. It's simply a matter of personal taste. The Dresden Oak is a little more ornate, a little more plush, the Birch Master is a little more austere, but a choice with a great deal of integrity, I would say. What do you think? Get him that one. Done, um... have to go. Does this take care of it? That takes care of it. This will be a quality service, Mr. Grace, you have my word. Thanks. Come on, Chris, we have to go. Uh, Sam. Yeah? Uh... the next time you get an occasion to do this. Yeah. The Dresden Oak. You got it. There he is. There he is. Oh, my God. Never seen that before. Oof. Daddy, damn it, how could you do this? You're late to my wedding. You made the groom late to my wedding! Not yet. I was all ready to take over and give her away for you, Samuel. Thanks, Ben, that won't be necessary, the genuine article is here. That you are, Sam Grace. How many times have I asked you for anything, huh?! Not many. All I asked was for you to come home and to give me away on the most important day of my life, and then you steal Chris, and you take off on a motorcycle and I can't even... Sweetheart! I am sorry. I truly am. Don't cry. Don't cry, no crying. Okay. Let me finish getting dressed real quick. Okay. Here we go. Okay. Pull it together, no tears. Alright. Oh, I'm a little dizzy. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Let's do this. You ready, baby? I'm ready. I love you, Nina. I love you too, Daddy. Come on. Okay. Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved... Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and the presence of these witnesses. Who gives this woman to be married to this man? A wretch like me, I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see. 'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear And Grace, my fears relieved Oh, how precious did that Grace appear the hour I first believed Oh, Lord. Mmm, ohhhhh. I miss you.
