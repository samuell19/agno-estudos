- Stop moving it! - I'm not moving it. I thought you were moving it. - No. - Then it must be the spirits. - Please try and be serious. - Okay, fine. - Are there any spirits here with us? That's it! We're done! Do it yourself! - Laura! You know I need you for safety. The devil's not gonna fuck with a virgin. Okay, fine. I was totally moving it. - It's not funny. Viola! How are we supposed to contact anyone if you're messing around with it? - Relax. It's just a game. Where did you get this one? It looks really old. - It was this weird store in town. - You think it actually works? - Yeah, I kind of do. I used it last night and someone came through. - As if! - I'm serious. - Oh yeah? Who'd you contact? - You're gonna think I'm crazy. - Too late. - I think it was Mary Blackwood. - The witch of Hazel Street? Okay, fine. Let's see what the old hag has to say tonight. - I don't think that's a good idea. - We want to speak to the spirit of Mary Blackwood. Are you there? - You heard that? - Most definitely. No one else is home? Are all the doors walked? - I think so. It could be Tim! He said he was gonna stop by. I wouldn't put it past him to try and scare us. - And when were you gonna tell me you took that trifling man whore back? - He promised me the rumors weren't true. - Oh, he promised? Because he's always been nothing but 100% percent truthful since you met him. - I know you don't like him. - Sweetie, I know he looks like he got off the casting couch of Dawson's Creek, but he has the personality of a box of hair. Come on, let's call his bluff. - What if it's not him? What if it's something else? - Like who? Mary Blackwood? - Tim! - So original, Timothy. - It worked on you, Vi. - What the hell are you doing here? - I came to steal my girlfriend back from your clutches. - Which girlfriend? - V, stop! - I didn't know you girls were raising the dead. - Sure are. You gonna join us ore are you too scared? - Let's do it. - Tim, no, you don't have to. - Come on, babe. It'll be fun. Who we contacting? - The witch. Mary Blackwood. - Yeah, I thought she was an urban legend. - No, it's public record. The people of the town hanged her from the tree and then burned her body to ashes. - All right. Come on, Mary Blackwood, take a break from being Satan's whore and show us that hagged face of yours. - I didn't do it. I swear. - Relax. It was probably just your breaker. Where's your fuse box? - In the attic. - Of course it is. - Tim, no, maybe you shouldn't! - Hello? Is someone there? - Laura, are you okay? - When I used the board last night, I just wanted to know if Tim was cheating on me. - What'd it say? - It said yes. - See? Even a dead witch knows he's trash. - I was so mad, I told her I wanted Tim to be dead. - Same, girl. What's the problem? - Last night I had a dream that he was dead, killed by the witch, and it felt so real. - It's fine. It was just a dream. - Tim! - Laura, he's just messing with us. - Tim, this isn't funny! No! It's her! It's the witch! Who are you? ♪ This invented madness ♪ This invented madness ♪ This invented madness ♪ This invented madness - Oh, good morning, Sarah. - Morning, Viola. - Oh, I guess "mom" is too formal these days. - Morning, mother. Better? - Yeah. Can I make you a little coffee? Something? - That's okay. I have to get to work. - Ugh, I get so worried about you working at that bar so late. I wish you could find something else. - Yeah, well, I don't love it either, but how else am I gonna get a place of my own? - Yeah, I know you're really not happy about being back here. I'm sure your stepmom's place was so much bigger. - It was, but I kind of got the feeling she wanted me out of there as soon as possible. - What makes you say that? - She told me she wanted me out of there as soon as possible. - That rotten woman. To her own stepdaughter? - Mom, it's fine. - No, it's not fine! I'm gonna call her. I'm gonna give her a piece of my mind! - Just forget about it. She said I remind her too much of him. - Honey, I'm sorry. - Okay, I have to get to work. - He was like, "Bro, I heard all that screaming in the room and everything." I was like, "Yeah, that was me." - Now you need to rub some of that charisma off on my little brother here. - Oh, it's definitely coming, man. It's going on tonight. Ain't that right, baby? - Yeah. You ready to pop that cherry, little brother? - I don't know. - I'm gonna get 'em together. Don't you worry about this, man. I'm gonna get some titties in your face, okay? - Great! How long have they been here? - Long enough to make me thankful I'm not a breeder. - We should all be so lucky. - And, tag, you're it. - Don't do me any favors. - I'll be your best friend. Your very, very best friend. - You're already my only friend. Hey, guys. - Good to see you, Sarah. - Hi, Eric. Sarah, our favorite beer witch. - Clever, Caleb. Never heard that one before. - Oh, come on, darling. You don't have to be so uptight. What's the matter? Need to get laid? - Hey, come on, Isaac! - Hey, hey! I was just offering my services. - I'd rather join a convent. - Asshole. - Is that funny to you? - "You asshole!" - Look, I'm sorry about him. He's he's just drunk. - I didn't realize that was an excuse for assault. - I didn't mean to say it was. - Are we done here, Derek? - Look, I just wanna say I'm really glad you're back. You know, after you left for New York, I just never thought I'd see you again. - Things didn't exactly go as planned. - I'm sorry to hear about your dad. He was a really good guy. - Thanks. He was. - You staying with your mom? - For now, until I find a place of my own. - How is she? You know, last I heard she was... - She's doing just fine. - Fuck. - Oh, Sarah! Hey! Hey, my little baby brother Asher here, and he needs a date. You know anyone you can hook him up with? - He's joking. I don't... I don't need help. - Oh, nonsense! Hey! - No, no, no. He's right. Hey, but listen. no good girls. They ain't no fun. - No, we need someone who's gonna keep him on his toes. A real witch, one might say. - Isaac, stop. - No one asked you, Derek. What do you say, Sarah? Think your mother still has Mary Blackwood's number? Or we could just dust off the old Ouija board and get your dad to grab it for us. - Isaac, that's enough! - It's okay, Derek. I'm sorry, Isaac, but the only single girl I know is my good friend Liz over there. - Ugh. - But I'm pretty sure her dick is bigger than yours. - Shit! - All of yours, in fact. - Oh, shit, is that right? You wanna find out? - Caleb, if I wanted your comeback, I'd scrape it off the back of Isaac's throat. - The fuck? - Stupid! - Hey! That's enough! You boys, you're outta here. - We haven't finished our drinks yet! - Oh, these? - Jesus Christ! - Out now, all of you! - What the fuck? - This ain't over! Not by a long shot. - Okay, Liz. - Sorry. - Hey, you okay? - I'm fine. - Sometimes it's okay to just not be fine. Sometimes it's okay to scream or cry or punch someone in the teeth 'cause they slightly inconvenienced you. - Just being back here and serving guys like that makes me feel like such a failure. - Honey, most of those boys have had an easy life because of their families. You've been through hell and seen the other side. That's a success, not a failure. - I haven't thought of it like that. Every time my mom looks at me, it makes me feel like she's judging me too. - Sarah, I'm not gonna tell you what to do, but my parents kicked me out when I was 18. I never spoke to them again. Your mom wants to be in your life. What are you afraid of? - I guess I'm still embarrassed. - Hey, you're over a year sober, something to be proud of, not embarrassed by. - I'm still learning how to be around people, you know? - Yes. No one gets that more than I do, believe me. But this whole self-deprecation, self-isolation bull shit, it's not gonna make anything better. - You're always right. You know that? - Yeah, I do. Ride home? - No thanks. I like the walk. - You're out of my way anyway. Get home safe. - Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's just me. - Derek! What the hell? - It's a good thing you're not too trigger happy with that thing. - Why would you sneak up on a woman walking home alone in the middle of the night? - I was just trying to catch up with you. Sorry I scared you. - Well, I'm not sorry I almost burnt your eyes out. - Not even a little bit? - Maybe just a smidge. What do you want? - Look, I just wanna apologize for my friends. You know, they're douche bags. - You are the company you keep. - Okay. I deserve that. - Why do you hang out with them? It must be exhausting. - I mean, it is, but I don't really have anyone else. Asher's been there since the sandbox, and Isaac's always looked out for us. - It's okay to outgrow your friends. - Yeah, but it's not that easy. Isaac's dad gave me a job with the construction company, so it's not really wise to get on the wrong side of the family. But maybe if I had someone else to hang out with. - Are you asking me out? That's so sweet. No. - Wait, what? Why? - Because you asked me to eighth grade formal and then dumped me for Julie Henderson when you found out she Frenches on the first date. - I have to make it up to you then, if you'll let me. - Kind of just been trying to do me recently, you know? - No, I've been doing me too. Every night, in fact. - A masturbation joke. Clever. - Thank you. I've been work-shopping it. What do you think? - I'd avoided it as a pickup line. - Look, I just wanna say I am really glad you're back. - Oh, isn't that cute? - The hell do you guys want? - Hey, man, we just wanna offer the lady our apologies for the misunderstanding earlier, that's all. - Save your breath. - Just get back in the car, guys. - Oh, no can do, Romeo. We have unfinished business with Sarah. You think you can just treat us like shit and get away with it? - I call 'em like, I see 'em. - Don't touch her! - Hey, where the fuck you going? Motherfucker! Hoo-hoo! Shit! God damn! I always knew he was thick-headed. - Cute. Not so tough without your little girlfriend around, huh? Hey, Asher! Get over here little brother. My friend here looks a bit thirsty. - Yeah, I think she could use a drink. - I am a bit thirsty. - Fucking bitch! Get her! - Come on, come on, come on! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Bitch! Where the fuck'd she go? - Behind you! Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Hey, no, no, please, God, no! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I didn't wanna do this. I just want the guys to accept me. - Hey, that's enough, Isaac. - Keep him over there! No smart-ass comment this time? - Come on, man. Let's get outta here. - I'm not done yet. - Isaac, come on, man! Let's go! You wanted to teach her a lesson, and you did, all right? You proved your point! Shit. - I think that's a sign from above to get out of here. - Look, I'm with him, Isaac. Let's get outta here, man. - Fine. - Hey, what are we gonna do about Derek? - Let's get him in the car. - Watch your ass. Get up! Get your ass up, man! - Good evening. How can I help you? My goodness, you're hurt! What happened? - This group of guys attacked me, and then I woke up and I was alone. - These men that did this to you, what would you like to see done to them? - I don't know. I guess I should call the cops. - Oh, you can. But what's to stop them from doing this to another girl? How long would they be locked up before they were back on the streets? - I guess I hadn't thought of that. - And that's if they believe you. These men have money, maybe strings that can be pulled in the town to get them out of trouble. And you. Well, you have a past. It's written all over you. What if you could stop these men for good, teach them that they can't just get away with everything? - In a perfect world. - It is a perfect world. There are other ways to make sure someone gets what they deserve. - How would I do that? - Come sit and rest. Have you ever used a spirit board before? There are pathways in this world far beyond your imagination. - It's just a game, right? - I can assure you it's no game. Have you ever lost someone you wish you could have had a few more moments with, wish you could speak to one last time, a family member perhaps? - I guess. We all have someone we wish we could talk to again. - Some of the boards even provide a pathway to righting what's wrong. Karma exists, and so does vengeance. - Look, I appreciate you helping me out, but it's getting late, and I just wanna go home. - Oh, suit yourself. I certainly hope you get home safe this time. - What do we have to do? - This board belonged to a very powerful witch, one who was murdered for crimes she didn't commit. Her sorrow and pain loom heavy. But she requires a sacrifice. - What kind of sacrifice? - Your blood. - What the hell? - Sit. Sarah, I said sit. You'll have to repeat after me, understand? - Yes. - I summon the spirit attached to this board. - I summon the spirit attached to this board. - A woman wronged, a woman betrayed, a woman with vengeance in her heart. - A woman wronged, a woman betrayed, a woman with vengeance in her heart. - Talk to her, Sarah. Ask her if she's here. Tell her what you want. - Hello, spirit. Are you here with us right now? What is your name? M. A. R. Y. Is this Mary Blackwood? - Keep on going, Sarah. You can't go back now. - I want the men who attacked me tonight to know the pain that I felt, to feel frightened, hopeless, vulnerable. Can you help me. - Run along, Sarah. The door has already been opened. - Hey, beautiful. You need some help? - Yes. I would love your help. - So what do you have in mind? - You killed him. - What? - You ran away. - No, it wasn't like that. - You left him alone to die. - No! No! Please! - Shh. Now go and find peace. - Sarah. - You can catch flies with that thing. - Sorry. Didn't get much sleep last night. - How'd the rest of your night go? - It was fine. Went home, took a bath. Liz, you've known my mom for a while. - Yeah. Yeah, since I was a kid. She used to babysit me. - You know about what happened to her? - I know what people have said happened to her. - Did she ever talk to you about that night at Laura's? - No, sweetie. She didn't really talk to anybody after that night. - Do you know anything about Mary Blackwood? - Yeah. I mean, I know what's in the museums. Her husband was cheating on her, and when she found out, he accused her of being a witch. She was hanged on that large tree that's still in the street, and then burned. Her husband then married his mistress a month later. You know, the worst part of it is that she had three daughters, forced to grow up without their mother. - Do you believe the stories about her? - I mean, it depends on what stories you're talking about. Do I think that she practiced witchcraft? Maybe. They said that she had this spirit board she used to communicate with the energies of the earth. But do I think that she's gonna come back every couple years to seek revenge on this town? I don't know. Look, I knew your mother very well before that night. And after that night, she was a completely different person. She saw something that messed her up. - Her therapist thinks it was all in her head, that Tim and Laura killed themselves after a fight about him cheating and mom went into shock finding them. - Hm. That's certainly a less complicated explanation. Sure. But if you talk to some people in this town, they'll tell you that Mary Blackwood has some kind of secret, underground cult of witches that still worship her, helping her haunt this town for eternity. Boo! Should see your face. - I'm gonna go check stock. - Okay. - Sarah? Hey, Sarah! - Derek. - Jesus! - Sorry, man. - Did you follow me here? - You weren't answering my calls or texts. - Yeah, for a reason. Goodbye, Asher. - So I'll see you home later on tonight. - I'm not coming back. I got a new place to crash until I find something more permanent. - Please, just... Just talk to me, Derek! I mean, you're my best friend. - We're not friends. Asher. We haven't been for a while. We're just two people that grew up together. - Look, I told them not to do it. I tried to get 'em to stop. - You could have killed her. - But we didn't! She's fine! - How do you know that? - I went to the bar earlier today, looked in the window, and she was fine, so no harm, no foul. - If that helps you sleep better at night. - You know I just want them to accept me, like I was one of the other guys. - Why, Asher? Who the fuck cares? Be you. Because whoever you're trying to be, I don't like it, man. I was always your friend, no matter what. - Please, Derek. Hey, I'm so sorry. You gotta forgive me, man. - Try forgiveness with someone else. I'm done. - Hey. Derek. - So is that wedding ring attached for good, or does it come off for special occasions? - Well, I guess that depends on who's asking. - Derek! Hi! How are you tonight, hot stuff. - Hi, Louise. Thanks. - Oh my God, you smell so good. Are you wearing Prada? - I'm not wearing anything. - So it must be your natural musk. Yum. Hey, you should buy me a drink. - Maybe later, Louise. Listen, can we talk about last night? - I'm working. - I'll wait till you're done then. - Whatever. - Hi. - Hm. - Another round? - You better make it a double. - You all need to find Jesus. - Hello? - Asher. Asher. Asher. Asher. - Jesus! - Not quite. - Yeah, I think she could use a drink. Stupid bitch. - Help. Someone. Please help me. - Are you frightened? - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Asher. - Hey, you okay? Sit down. Please, God, I don't wanna die. - God? No. No God. And no heaven. There's only rot! - Sarah? - Are you okay? - Seriously, I'm fine. I just got dizzy. - You shouldn't be on your feet. - I'm okay. - Sarah, it's a slow night. You could take the rest of it off if you want. - Are you sure? - Of course. Go home, get some rest. - Maybe you're right. - Come on. I can walk you home. Look, are you sure you don't need a doctor or something? - Why would I need a doctor, Derek. - Sarah... You were right about them. I don't need them as friends, any of them. Whatever you need, I'll do it. If you want me to go to the cops, I'll tell them everything. - No. No cops. I don't want anything like that involved. - What do you want me to do? - Stay away from them. Keep yourself safe. - And what about you? - I can take care of myself. - Look, I know you can. I like a girl who can take care of yourself. - Well then I've got the perfect one for you. - Yeah? Who's that? I really didn't need to see that. - I bet she Frenches on the first date. - Still haven't forgot about that have you? - Not a chance. - She looks all right. I tell ya, man, last night I thought she was- - Yeah, I know, Caleb. - You think she's gonna go to the cops? - I don't know. I feel like if she was, she would've done it already. Still, though, we need to make sure. - What you mean, "make sure"? - I'm gonna follow her, put a little fright in her, you know? - No. Nah, man, fuck that. No. Count me out, dude. - Excuse me? - No, Isaac, I'm serious, man. Look, I'm getting tired of this shit, all right? I've got too much good going in my life right now just to fuck it up for your ego. - Hey, she insulted all of us! You damn right she did, and we kind of deserved it! What the fuck you got to prove, man? Huh? We're not in high school anymore. Life has stakes now, fuckin' consequences. - Damn it. No, you're right. You're right, it does. Let's not do anything. Let's just go home. All right? We'll wait. Wait for her to tell somebody. Then what's gonna happen, huh? What do you think? You remember how every night your dad used to beat this shit outta you, and I was the one, hey, listen to me, I was the one who snuck you into my house to protect you. - That's what we're doing? Okay. You were there for me. You protected me. I remember that. Yes, I get it. - Who's gonna protect your when I'm behind bars, huh? - Look, man, just leave the girl alone, all right? The shit's over with, man. We should have never fucked with her to begin with. - You kidding me? What, you just wanna walk away now, huh? No, no, we're already in this. Hey, look, if I get one more charge against me, just one, it is over for me, and it'll sure as shit be over for you too. - Fuck that. - No, no, you look at me. I am not gonna let that little bitch ruin our lives. Okay? Get your head in the game. - Who are you? - Asher. A woman wronged. A woman betrayed. A woman with vengeance in her heart. - Bad dream? - Mom? - Sarah, when you came back here, I thought that we had an agreement that we were gonna be honest with each other about everything. - What are you talking about? - I just got off the phone with your stepmother. - I told you not to call her. - I didn't. She called me. You had a letter sent to her place about a court date next month? - That letter is none of her business. - No, but it's mine. Breaking and entering? Destruction of private property? Sarah, were you using again? - God, mom, no! It wasn't that dramatic. Dad and Lydia were fighting, and I just didn't wanna be around it. I thought it was abandoned. Turns out I was wrong. - Well, when were you gonna tell me? I mean, what, you thought I wouldn't find out? - Yeah, kind of. That was the idea. I didn't want you to overreact. - And she told me that... you were stealing from her. - Gimme a break! That woman leached off of dad for years. I just borrowed a couple bucks for the subway. - Oh my God, Sarah. What happened to you? You were my little girl. - Come off it, mom. You were never there as a parent, and I was never your little girl. You were always too obsessed with her to even notice me. - With who? - Mary Blackwood. - Stop it. Don't say- - Why? Why were you so afraid that she'd come back for you? Do you know how to stop her? Is there a way to stop her? - Mary Blackwood is dead. She's been dead for centuries. I know she's not real now. Tim and Laura killed themselves. I know I should have listened to your father and gotten therapy, and I'm sorry if this affected the way I've raised you for so long, but that's over now. She's not coming back. - But what if she did? What if she did come back, but not for you? - What do you mean by that? - I have to go. - Sarah, wait a minute! Sarah, please tell me you're not saying what I think you're saying. - I'm sorry I never believed you. I don't wanna drag you back into this again! Derek? What the hell? What's wrong? - I didn't know where else to go. - What happened? - It's Asher. He's dead. - What? - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here, not after what they did. - No, Derek, wait! What happened to him? - They think it was a suicide. - I saw Asher. I saw him in my dream. - What are you talking about? - Derek, I don't think he killed himself. - Another! - Do you really think that's a good idea right now? - My little brother is dead. You have a better idea of what I should be doing right now? - Hey. Take it easy. - When I woke up, I thought it was a dream. It felt so real, but it couldn't be. - You think that you conjured the spirit of Mary Blackwood and now she's trying to kill everyone that attacked you that night? - Look, I know I sound crazy. I know I sound like my mother. - No. - But the dream I had last night was so real. And if I'm right, you're in danger too. - Why would you say that? - I saw you last night in my dream. Dead. You were hanging from a noose. You don't believe me, do you? - No, no. I do. - Really? - Yeah. I had the same dream of being hanged, and it felt so real. I woke up and I was still in pain, and I looked in the mirror and I saw this. - Oh my God. - It still burns. - We have to stop her, then, before she can kill anyone else. - How do we do that? - I wanna go back to that shop where I met that woman. She told me the door was open. Maybe she knows how to close it. - Okay. - Come on! Damn it! - Are you sure this is the right shop? I mean, the place you described is kind of dime a dozen in this town. - It was here, I swear! She took me into the back room and made me touch the board. - Well, if we can't find the board, then we're gonna have to come up with another plan. - We have to warn Isaac and Caleb. She's gonna go after them just like she went after Asher. - I always thought you were cute. I loved watching you play football on Friday nights and tackling all the tight ends. - Is that so? - It is so. Hey, Caleb. - Caleb! - Pull up a chair. I'll buy a drink. - No, no, no, man. Let's go on and get you home, all right? It's been a long day for you. - Oh, fuck that. Me and Louise were just getting reacquainted. - Yeah? Well, say goodnight, all right? Come on, man. I'll call you cab. - I'll call you a cock sucker. She tell you to come get me? - Come on, Isaac. Don't start that. - No, fuck all of you! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Isaac, calm down, man. Listen. Asher was a good kid, all right? We all know that. But there was no way you could have known he would do something like this, all right? - You really believe that suicide bullshit? Yeah right. - All right, Isaac. So what else was it then, man? - I tell you what it was. It was that bitch Sarah. She's a nut just like that mother of hers. I'm telling you, she's after us. - What the fuck, man? - What the fuck is going on here? Are you fucking hearing yourself, man? You know what? Go on your own trip. I'm through with this shit, man. Through with you and your fucking ego! - You know what? I think I will get outta here. I'm gonna find Sarah. End this now. - Hey, Isaac, come on, man. - Hey! - Come on, man! - I'll see you later. - Whatever. - I'm glad you're here. - Caleb. - Do I know you? - Perhaps. - Show off. - Stomp that bitch, Isaac. Yeah. Uh-huh. You can't fuck with us! What the fuck? - Do you feel hopeless? - Hey! Hold it right there, you psycho bitch! No one kills my customers! - Why? When he would leave you to die if given the opportunity. - What the fuck? - Stand. Men have hurt and taken advantage of you your entire life. Do not numb the pain any longer. Take back control of yourself. - We're too late. - Liz! - Sarah. Hey. - Don't move. - What happened? - The stories. They're true. Viola was right. Mary Blackwood is real. She's one tough bitch. - Call her an ambulance. - What are we gonna do about the witch? - We're gonna get that board and send that god damn witch back to whatever hell she came from. - How do we do that? - I have a pretty good idea. - What the hell? Hey, it's you. You lost? You need me to take you home? - I am home. - You sure you live here? - Come. Join me. - Don't have to tell me twice. You forget to pay the heating bill? This isn't your house, isn't it? - It shall be our house. Together. - You like that, you fucking bitch? - Where did you go? All right. You are so beautiful. - Disrobe. - Yes, ma'am. Okay, I can get into this. - Oh no! No! Sarah! God. Oh my God, Liz! Oh my god. Oh my God, she was here! She was here, wasn't she? - Mary Blackwood. - Where's Sarah? - She went to get the Ouija board. She's trying to stop her. - Are you vulnerable? - What? No! No! - Don't get soft now. - What the hell is Isaac doing here? - We might be too late for him. - Sarah, wait. Isaac! Are you in here? Oh, God. Isaac. - Derek. - Let's just find the board. - In my dream it was in the attic. What's wrong? - I'm fine. - No, you're not! It's definitely in this room. It's over here. She's close. We have to hurry. - You ready? - Not at all. Let's do it. - Mom? - What are you doing in here, Sarah? - I have to stop her! - We can't be in here, baby. I can't be in here. - I have to send her back before she comes for Derek! - What do you mean send her back? What did you do, Sarah? - I brought back Mary Blackwood! All these years, you were right! We should have believed you. - Well, real or not, I should never have let her control my life the way she did. - Then help me. - I don't know if I can. - I opened the door. You can help me close it. - That's not the way it works. You don't think she's gonna stop with Derek. Once she does your bidding, she comes for you. You only close the door when you die. - What? - Yeah, that's what happened to Laura. - We can still talk to her, bargain with her. I need you to help me. - You can't bargain with Mary Blackwood. She's pure evil. - Mom, please. We have to try. - You're right. This ends tonight. I summon the spirit attached to this board, a woman scorned, a woman betrayed, a woman with vengeance in her heart. Mary Blackwood, my daughter brought you back from the afterlife, but she left the door open. I command you to close the door and leave! What do you want? - H. E. R. B. L. Her blood. - We should stop. - No. We have to keep going. Mary Blackwood, will you take the blood of another? - Mom, what are you doing? - It's okay, honey. Everything's gonna be okay. Don't worry. Will you take my blood? - Mom, no! Mary Blackwood, I know you were innocent. I know you're angry. I want you to be free. Let go of the anger, Mary. Leave this realm. - Derek. - Don't cause anyone else any more pain. Don't cause my mother the pain you felt when you were taken from your children. Close the door! Is she gone? - She's gone. You've made her close the door. You did it! - I knew you could do it. - Your blood is next. You have been avenged, Sarah. Join me for eternity. - Mary, get your hands off my daughter! - It's too late. No more games. - Burn in hell, witch! - Derek! - Honey, honey, don't look. Let's just get you outta here, okay? - You were gonna sacrifice yourself for me. - Of course. I'm your mother. I'd do anything for you. - The Ouija board! It's gone! - Oh, it's destroyed forever. - Are you sure? Mom? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Good evening. How can I help you?
