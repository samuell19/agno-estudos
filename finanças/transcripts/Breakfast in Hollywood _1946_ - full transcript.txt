About three months ago. A lot can happen in that time. When he stopped writing, I thought... Yes? Nothing. Do you think he might be in San Diego? No, my dear. Let's be practical. You come back here at 5 o'clock tonight and I'll have a return ticket to Minneapolis for you, hmm? I'll tell you what I'll do. You go to the lounge and freshen up and I'll give you a ticket to Tom Breneman's "Breakfast In Hollywood." You still got time. That will cheer you up a bit. - How will that be? - You've been awfully kind. - Forget it. - Thank you. [instrumental music] [sighs] Now, don't you worry about me, Tippy. I'm gonna be alright. I'll only be gone about an hour or so. I'm gonna do something this morning... ...that I wanted to do for a longtime. There you are. Now, see, you're a little croupy this morning. Well, now maybe you'll pull in that pride of yours and let me get a little box of sand in the house at night. Come here. Nobody needn't know about it, but you and me. Well, have it your own way. Now, darling, stay in the sun this morning. And don't take your sweater off. Goodbye, Tippy. - Richard? - Huh? - Are you awake? - No. - I'm leaving. - Huh? [yawning] Anyone who gets up at daybreak to see a radio show is nuts. - Now, Richard... - Well, go ahead. If you get a kick out of being goofy don't let me spoil your fun. Oh, would you rather I go with you to San Diego today, dear? I wouldn't think of subjecting you to it. 'I'm going strictly on business, and there'll be no time' for pleasantries. Now, run along to your concert. Radio show. Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye? [snorts] Well, have a lovely trip, dear, and don't work too hard. [door closes] [door opens] I left my purse.

Alright, thank you. - Where is your home? - Minneapolis, sir. - Is that the right time? - Yes, why? I'm trying to catch an early radio show. "Breakfast In Hollywood." Ever heard of it? I'm afraid I have. My aunt back in Minneapolis listens every morning. A very intelligent woman. With a very good taste too. - Oh, it's-it's good then, huh? - Oh, terrific. Sometimes it keeps me awake all night. Say, do you know the fella who runs it, uh, Tom Breneman? Well, my mother knows him very well. In fact, she folded his first pair of pants. [chuckles] Well, do you think may be you could get me a ticket? Oh, I'm sure I could. In fact, by strange coincidence I have one in my pocket right here. - There you are. - Oh, thank you, sir, but... Gee, I don't wanna rob you over good time. Oh, not at all. I have no trouble getting in. It's getting out that bothers me. Getting out is sure sweet words to me. - Just got my discharge. - Oh, swell. Why aren't you headed for home? Well, I am, but some important business holds me here. I sewed a civilian clothes that won't be ready until this afternoon.

Will you please get out? Seriously, folks, each morning, just before we hit the air we kinda like to visit a bit with... You guess and kinda find out where you're from, you know kind of break the ice one of those sort of thing, and... Hello, there. Who are you? Mrs. Marie Edgedaw of Cherry Valley, California. - Cherry valley? Mm-hmm. - Uh-huh. Uh, Mrs. Edgedaw, where is Cherry Valley from here? - Up near Baumann. - You mean, down near Baumann? Up. Well, isn't Baumann down by Banning? Yes, but we are up on the mountain, that's up. [laughter] Let's get this right, now. When, uh, when you go south, you go up south or down south? We go up south, but we're a little northeast. [laughter] You're over thataway. In other words... No, northeast and the top. Tom, we're just 29 miles from Palm Springs. - Oh, is that so? - Uh-huh. Up or down or south... Oh, we're just to the right of us. Yeah. [laughter] Wait, uh... Ow... [laughter] Listen, Mrs. Edgedaw, did you ever hear of a down and sleepy valley? Ooh, yes. Well, look, do you know of any valley which you have to go up to get to? - Mm-hmm. - What? - Cherry Valley. - Cherry Valley. I give up. [laughter] Well, let us go over here and visit a little bit now. Hello, there. Who are you? - Dorothy Larsen. - Dorothy Larsen. Well, come on, Dorothy, stand up here and let the ladies see you. Gee, you're pretty. Where are you from? - Minneapolis, Minnesota. - Minneapolis. With a name like Larsen, you couldn't be from any other place, but Minnesota. [laughter] You're awful. Tell me, Dorothy, do you hear the program back there occasionally? Oh, do I have to tell? My goodness. We are not that bad, are we? Oh, no, but... Well, my boss may be listening in. Don't worry about it. We are not on the air, just yet. But you do hear us occasionally, huh? Oh, yes, back in Minneapolis, at this time each morning I used to have coffee and donuts in Maddy's drugstore, and well, I listen then. Uh-huh. And you weren't suppose to be listening? Uh, I wasn't supposed to be having coffee and donuts. [laughter] Oh, well, don't think the laughs on me. Oh, why not? - I quit my job two weeks ago. - Oh, you did it. Well, I'm quitting you too, right now. She's alright. [bell dings] [tires screeching] [indistinct chattering] It's alright, mother. You'll be fine. You're okay. - Call an ambulance. - Right. Don't sit up yet. Everything's alright. Who's the driver of this car? I am, officer. But it really wasn't my fault. I was still in second gear. I was just trying to... Take it easy, bud, but stick around. - Don't try to get up, lady. - That's right, mother. You just stay here, rest a little. Oh, what do you mean rest. I just got out of bed an hour ago. You might me hurt. Oh, away with such foolishness. - I'm alright. - Are you sure? I certainly, I'm not a bit hurt. Let me get back to the sidewalk. Wait a minute. I've got an ambulance coming. Oh, don't tell me that. I haven't time for such foolishness. I've got to go someplace. I think perhaps, officer, the lady says... Will you keep out of this? Where do you wanna go, lady? Oh, just, down to "Breakfast In Hollywood." It's only a little way down the street and I tell you, I'm alright. But I don't know that, you see. Oh, well, I'll miss it, I've been looking forward to it for a week, and I'm late now. - Really, officer, I think if... - Will you be quiet? Listen, I'll go into Mr. Breneman and sit down, and then if you want to, you can come and look in on me, if you ever mind. Alright, mother, you go ahead, I'll come down to see you just as soon as I get through here. Thank you. Oh, excuse me, but, uh, when you say as soon as you are through here, does that mean... It certainly does. It means, you and I gonna have a nice long chat. Let me see your driver's license. Oh, but, officer, this is going to throw me off schedule. [audience cheering] [Tom] 'Thank you.' Good morning, ladies. [all] Good morning, Tom. And good morning to you out there along our network. Good morning from the ladies having "Breakfast In Hollywood." And say, we have a swell turnout here this morning. Along about this time of our program, we like to visit a bit. I think we'll start with maybe you. - What is your name? - Harriet Dean. - Where you from, Ms. Dean? - I'm from Miami, Florida. Miami, Florida. Hmm, hot down there, isn't it? [laughter] And let's see, um, who are you, please? - Your name? - Mullins this morning. Oh, this morning? This afternoon, it will be Henderson. - Oh, being divorce? - I am being married. 'Well, then congratulations!' I suppose you are the happy groom-to-be? Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. Tell me, Mr. Henderson, are you being married in Hollywood? - We are. - Mm-hmm. [chuckles] Uh, what is your business, Mr. Henderson? - I'm Ms. Mullen's secretary. - Hmm. What some folks won't do to keep a secretary these days. [laughter] Oh, thank you. I see one. Alright, folks, now we are going to meet our service boys and girls. And I'll ask you to hold your applause as I do each day until we've met them all. We just wanna be sure that the home folks have a chance to hear them. - You? - 'Peter Michael...' Oh, excuse me. Is this seat taken? No, no, I came alone too. Well, that's nice. So did I. I didn't wanna embarrass anyone. Why don't you put a clove in your mouth? Then, nobody will know you've been drinking. No, no, I mean, my hat. Do you think it's silly enough for Mr. Brewneman to pull on? Breneman. [no audio] It is kind of crazy in an artistic sort of way. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. You know, for seven months, I've been trying to wear a hat that Mr. Breneman would put on. - Well, I bet this is it. - Oh, do you think so? Well, I hope so. - 'Lieutenant?' - Lieutenant Steven Wayne. - Born in Maryland, sir. - Mm-hmm. - But they're two, haven't you? - Yes, sir, a little bit. What are some of those things, lieutenant? Well, that's the Navy Cross and a Purple Heart, and this... Oh, we have only 30 minutes, we can't go into all of that. And well, look who's here. Do you recognize me? Who are you anyway? Electrician's Mate Third Class, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Well, that will help a lot. What's your name? No coaching, please. Oh, Ken Smith. Well, wait a minute, Ken, don't get mad about it now you hear me? What were you doing out in San Fernando Valley? Trying to find some people from Minneapolis. - What for? - Just to talk to, I guess. Oh, Ken, you don't have to go out to San Fernando Valley to find people from Minneapolis to talk to. Come on here, son, I'm old cupid Breneman, and I'll take you... [applauding] Now tell us who you are again? I'm Dorothy Larsen. Oh, Dorothy, I want you to meet Ken Smith. - How do you do? - Go on, Ken, pull up a chair. Oh, this is gonna be swell. Now, you kids get together and talk your heads off, will you? Both of you need somebody to talk to. Mm-hmm. Aren't they a handsome couple? [applauding] Just that I, I hate to leave here without... - Without what? - Without finding my fiance. - Oh. - I came here to look for him. He's from Minneapolis too. He's name is James Glenning. - And he's in the Navy... - Jimmy Glenning? - Do you know him? - Do I know him? Why... Yes, go on. What were you going to say? Nothing, I-I don't think he's the same fella that you know. [Tom] 'Now I guess we've met them all.' I wish everybody in uniform, in the restaurant to please stand because we wanna give you a welcome to "Breakfast In Hollywood." On your feet! And let them out. Look, the more I think of it, I'm not even sure if he came from Minneapolis. This guy was engaged to a girl by the name of... W-what do you say your name was? Dorothy. There you are. His girl's name was Clara. Alright, come on, come on, come on, Minneapolis, break it up. The convention is over here now. Ken, you get back to the table. And before you go, for being such a good sport here is couple of $5 bills for you. Oh, gee. Thanks, Mr. Breneman. And if you are in Hollywood tonight spend it on her, will you? - I sure will. - And spend it in here. Come on, give him a hand. [applauding] Now then, we're going for a hat. This silly routine every morning. I don't know what you're laughing about. [coughs] - Who are you, please? - Mary Colder. Mary Colder, where are you from, Mary? - Uh, Kansas. - You're from Kansas? Where did you get that silly number? Just a little thing I cooked up myself. You cooked it up yourself. Looks like it boiled over. 'Look at there, that is a monstrosity down there.' Hmm, I simply have to get a closer look at that thing. No, we're talking about you. Don't look over your shoulder. - Who are you? - Elvira Spriggens. And where are you from, Ms. Spriggens? - Pomona. - Pomona. I should have known. 'That is the silliest thing I've seen in this place' in a long time. Where do you live now? - In Hollywood. - In Hollywood. That looks like a typical Hollywood model. What is it, Bobby? There? Oh, my goodness! - This is even worse. - Mr. Breneman. - You want me to take it off? - No, not just right now. - You like it? - Yes, I'll be back. - Look at this thing. - Hello, Tom. That is awfully nice of you to come over and say hello to us this morning. - Oh, I'm so glad to be here. - Pleasure. And do you know Mrs. Cooper? Gary's mother? - No. Hello, Mrs. Cooper. - Hello. Gee, it's nice to see you. How is Gary? - Very well. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. That's grand. - Did you have a nice breakfast? - Oh, the loveliest bacon. Oh, fine. And Mrs. Luther. Joan Caulfeld's mother.

You hear on our program too, do you? - Every morning. - Mm-hmm, do you enjoy it? - Very much. - Well, that's nice. Do you think I am a good master of ceremonies? - The best ever. - Oh. - Do you think I'm handsome? - Very handsome. And terribly underpaid, wouldn't you say? Yes, very much underpaid. You know, you sound just like my mother. - I am your mother. - And she is too. [applauding] Oh, what a lot of ham in that family. Hey, speaking of ham, Hedda, I'm inviting you all down for a dinner tonight. Why, thank you, Tom. We'd love to. Oh, that'll be swell. Hedda, I know that you're famous for dafty hats but what is that suppose to represent? Well, when I left home this morning it was a gold fish bowl. Hedda, I simply have to try it on. Do you mind? What do you suppose I wore it for? 'Ms. Cooper, would you please hold the microphone' 'just like that, thank you.' There you are. This is the silliest thing I've ever seen even for you, Hedda. [laughs] There you are, kids. Don't you feel bad, deary. I think yours is much worse than hers. [Tom] 'Wait a minute, you smarties.' 'After all on me, it didn't attract a duck.' [Hedda] 'I know, but, brother, what an invitation to a woodpecker.' Hi, Hedda. Spike Jones and his City Slicker. Need I say anymore? What do you expect? Cherkovski.

Sev... - 'Seventy nine!' - Seventy nine, over here. - Eighty two. - Eighty two. Over there. Eighty two. Is that the winner? Eighty two. And so it is. The little lady over here. Well, isn't this nice? Hello, there. How are you? - Eighty three. - Eighty three. Eighty three. A female baritone. - 'Did you say that, sir?' - I'm 83 years old. Well, this is a ladies program, sir. [chuckles] You'd look pretty silly walking down Hollywood Boulevard with an orchid in your lapel. [laughter] Yes, I made a mistake. My daughter-in-law says I'm only 78. Hmm, how'd you make a mistake like that? - I've been married twice. - Oh. [laughter] Well, here's a little consolation prize for you. Have a cigar. 'Now, then, we'll go over here' 'and see the little lady who is 82.' - Hello, there. - Hello. Well, and who are you? I'm Annie Reed from Hollywood California and I'm pleased to meet you. Well, I'm pleased to meet you too. Tell me now, you say you're 82. I am, I'm 82, going on 83. Well, come on out here and meet the ladies. Gee, this is wonderful. Here she is. She's Annie Reed. She's from Hollywood. And she is 82. [applauding] Now, then, tell me, is it Ms. or Mrs. Reed? Mrs. of course. Oh, I love that of course. Why'd you say that? Well, because I was married. [laughter] Tell me, do you have any children? Yes, one son. - Grandchildren? - One. - Great-grandchildren? - One. Annie, you're in a rut. [laughter] Tell me, you don't mind my calling you Annie, do you, honey? Oh, no, I like it, Tommy. [laughter] You're a very active woman for 82. Oh, sometimes I feel that I'm not very active but I've got my own teeth. [laughter] I have mine too. On the lower side. [laughter] Do you and Mr. Reed live in Hollywood? Oh, no, Mr. Reed passed on about 26 years ago. I live alone with my little dog Tippy. Well, gee you smell nice. No, no, I didn't mean it. It's not quite like that. I mean, that perfume you have on is lovely. What is it? It's Muguet. It's Lily of the Valley in French. - Oh. - My favorite. Is that your favorite, hmm? Now, where were you born? Well, originally in Claremont, New Hampshire. You were born originally. [laughter] Oh, that's terrible. And where did you meet Mr. Reed? In New Ford, New Hampshire. And where did you go to live after your marriage? In Claremont, Newport. Then you lived in both places? How was that? Well, I'd live a month or two in Claremont and then, uh, I'd live two or three months in Newport. Mm-hmm, why though? Well, my husband used to be on the fire department so he had to live in Newport at odd times for the calls. Oh, I understand. Claremont was my home and Newport was where my husband lived. Well, that's a little inconvenient, isn't it? [laughter] It was inconvenient when a call had come through at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. Yes, I imagine so. [laughter] Oh, Annie! Now, from-from Newport to conve... I mean, from... Yes, I guess it would be. Then your husband was in Newport most of the time? - Uh, only for fire. - Oh, only for fire. And at other odd times, right, he was in Claremont. Hm. But where did he sleep? At the firehouse. [laughter] Uh, where was your son born? In Newport or Claremont? White pigeon, Minnesota. [laughter] Do you know, Annie, you could have saved us both a lot of trouble? You mean, if I had stayed back in Claremont? No, no, if you'd have burned the firehouse down in Newport. [laughter] Well, now, honey, look what we have for you. There it is. The orchid. Oh, it's awful pretty. Yes, and it's for you. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. You've heard the program, have you? Oh, yes, I listen to it every morning. Well, is that your first orchid? It most certainly is. And I want what goes with it. [laughter] Say, listen, dear... ...when I was taking my driver's test I ran over traffic, but then I had a blow out. How about your meeting me at my office at 12:30? Fine, that's only four hours away. Hey, where are you having the tire fixed? New Guinea? Oh, alright. But you be there at 12:30, you hear? Now, we're about to award our famous beauty kit. We'll ask one of our guests to draw a number here. - Who are you, please? - Florence Promise. - From where, Ms. Promise? - I'm from Philadelphia. From Philadelphia. What are you chewing? - Gum. - Oh, you have to spit it out. You can't chew gum on the radio. That's it. Will you draw a number out of the basket, please? - Hope it's mine. - Ah, I hope so too. Well, here it is. [laughter] "4-9-4-0-7." "4-9-4-0-7." He-he-here it is. Over here it is. [chuckles] Nice. You're a lucky person. Come on out here, now. Isn't this nice? [applauding] Now, tell us. Who are you? Well, I can't-can't remember my name. Don't worry. Oh, it's Richard. I mean, Mrs., Mrs. Richard Cartwright. - Well, now, congratulations. - Thank you. Where do you live, Mrs. Cartwright? I live in Ohio. Columbus, Ohio. I mean, I live in Hollywood. I don't seem to remember anything. No, just a little nervous. Now, don't be afraid of this microphone. - You've won our beauty kit. - I know. Beverly, won't you show it to Mrs. Cartwright? 'Same time show it to the ladies here.' [indistinct chattering] - Isn't that a dandy? - Oh, it's very nice. Uh-huh, well, you don't seem very excited about it, Mrs. Cartwright. Oh, but I am. It's just that I don't go in very much for cosmetics. Oh, but you will now. There's enough goop in there to keep you beautiful for a year. [laughter] I'm afraid my husband wouldn't care for that. You see, he likes the plain, natural, home type girl. Well, in this day and age, he's a novelty. - I figured to do that. - Do what? Split the wheel bearing, that's all. Well, is that, uh, is that serious? Well, we ain't got nothing in stock we'll have to send out for one. - Thank you very much. - You're very welcome. - Thank you, Mr. Breneman. - Thank you for asking. Goodbye. [male #2] 'Alright, ladies, let's move on.' 'Please, let's make a little room here.' [indistinct chatter] What in the world happened here, Bobby? - A lady fainted. - A lady fainted. [male #2] 'Make room, here, please.' [Tom] 'Why, Annie, you rascal, I'm surprised at you.' I'll be alright in a minute. Where's my pocketbook? Oh, don't worry, honey, it's right here. - Oh, thank you. - There you are. She was hit by a car about an hour ago, Tom. She claimed she wasn't hurt, so I let her come on in here. Do you have any pain? - Not much. - I've called an ambulance too. Oh, no ambulance. Don't let them take me to the hospital, please. Well, they just want to see if there's anything wrong with you. I'm-I'm alright. Thank you. Honest, I am. All I need is a good cup of tea in my own house. Well, if there's nothing wrong with you they'll take you right home. Oh, no, they're liable to keep me there, and... ...and what's to become of Tippy? My little dog. He is old and alone. He's got to have someone to take care of him. I'd be glad to take care of him today. I've nothing else to do. - Oh. - There you are. That's awful nice of you. You'd take him for a little walk, maybe? Why, sure. Now, you have nothing to worry about. Well, you're sure that they'll bring me home if they find there isn't too much wrong with me? I guarantee it. By golly, just to make sure, I'll go with you. How's that? Oh, you've been so nice to me. I-I just hate to put you out. Besides, you're gonna be awful mad at me. Look, what I did to my pretty flower. [indistinct chatter] [male #3] 'Alright, folks, strike it up, move on, please.' Well, there you are. May I speak to you for a minute? Well, sure. You were teasing me this morning, weren't you? About what? About not knowing Jimmy Glenning. - Oh. - Of course, you know him. 'Cause he sent me this picture several months ago. 'Thought you looked familiar. Then I remembered this.' Yeah, sure, I know Jim. Maybe you can tell me where to find him. I wish I could, but I don't know where he is. Honest, I don't. I'm sorry. Would you mind if I asked you a favor? Not a bit. Well, Jimmy means an awful lot to me, and I was wondering if... I'd be ever so grateful if you just talked to me a few minutes about him. It'd be a pleasure. Tell me, how he looked, and some of things he said and some of the things he did. Say, listen, I have to take Mrs. Reed's little dog for a walk. Would you like to go along? - You wouldn't mind? - Mind? Well, it might be a slight inconvenience but, uh, I think I can manage to stand up under the strain. [both laugh] [instrumental music] Well, this is an unexpected pleasure. I, uh, I was just going to write you a letter this afternoon. Are you kidding? You told me to meet you here. Uh, this is Myrtle, my roommate. - How do you do? - How do you do? Why, Gloria, why didn't you tell me he was so good-looking? Oh, Ms. Hammer, suppose you run along to lunch, huh? I'd be glad to. - Honey. - Yes? Listen, uh, um... Honey, Myrtle's broke, and so we thought it would be nice if you won some money for her at the races today too, huh? Oh, really, well, I mean, say after all... Uh-uh, Mr. Cartwright did anyone ever tell you that you look like Gable? Oh, really, you think so? Why, I haven't got his shoulders at all. Look, are we going to the races today or not? - It's 20 minutes to 1:00. - You bet we are. On our way, we'll stop at the barber's shop and then we're off. Nothing can stop us, now. I... - Cartwright? - Yeah. You'll have to come to the police station with me. That old lady you hit this morning is hurt worse than we thought. Here's a bench warrant for you. [whistling] Did you ever go to the Crystal Ballroom in Minneapolis? Oh, sure, every Saturday night. Oh, we went on Fridays. I guess maybe that's why I never saw you there. Yeah, that's just like me. I never get to meet a good-looking girl until it's too late. How about Docks for hamburger? Um, yeah, but little more on the chop suey side. Um, that was a little expensive for Jimmy and me. It's one thing I never had to worry much about, dough. With me, it was always here today and gone tomorrow. Don't you ever worry about your future? No, I got a grabby old uncle who does that. Not much sense in both of us worrying. You're lucky. I didn't have anybody to worry about me. - That is until I met Jimmy. - Come on, Tippy. He worries about me all the time. Look, uh... Oh, in a nice little ways, I mean. Like, not letting me sit in draft or telling the fellows to watch their language when I'm around. Doesn't that make you a pain in the neck to the other guys? Of course not. Well, they'll get a kick out of the way th... I-I never thought of it like that. Those are very pretty flowers. Yes, aren't they beautiful? Mm, they remind me of the ones down on the island. 'Cause it's so different. [clears throat] [instrumental music] [Dorothy laughing] 'Oh, oh, Ken, that's terrible.' Both of us look scared to death. Well, let's take another one. And smile this time. Okay, you know the trouble is... Uh, well, we're-we're posing like two other people. Maybe... Well, couldn't we... Huh? - What? - Uh, you know. Sort of act like we know each other a little bit better. Oh, alright. - How's this? - Swell. - Go ahead. - Huh? Put the quarter in. Oh, gee. Well, let-let-let's do it again. That pose is great. - You smiling? - Uh-huh. - Go ahead. - Okay. Ken, that wasn't fair. I'm sorry, I-I couldn't help it, honest, I couldn't. Dorothy. I'm sorry you misunderstood my friendliness. I didn't, Dorothy. It's just that you're darn sweet... What? I said you're so darn sweet and I'm so darn lonesome. Well, that isn't very flattering to me either. No, no, wh-what I mean is that... Well, uh, we're both sort of in the same boat. What we need is somebody to help us over, you see? No, I don't see. There's something that you ought to know. I'm gonna tell you, but you're not gonna like it. I don't want to hear anything more. As far as you're concerned, I'm terribly disappointed. Don't bother taking me back to the bus. But... Dorothy, please, I don't want you to think I'm just making a play for you. I meant that kiss from the bottom of my heart. Do you realize what you're saying? I sure do. Then you're a fine friend of Jimmy. I'm a better friend of yours. That's why I wanna tell you something. - What are you driving at? - Just this. You may be in love with Jimmy, but you're not engaged to him. Why do you say that? Because he's married to somebody else. Married? I didn't want to tell you before because well it was none of my business, and I knew it would hurt you. I don't believe you. You're making it up. If it is true, why didn't Jimmy tell me? Why didn't he write me? He was waiting to get up enough nerve. He met a girl at Spokane. He hadn't seen you for over a year. Just went hook, line, and sinker for this other girl and married her the week I shipped off. Somebody had to tell you sometime. So you thought for your own convenience, you'd tell me now. I just didn't want you to go on eating your heart out for... When you were on hand. That's the real reason you told me, wasn't it? I just told you. At first, I didn't think it was any of my business, but... Oh, oh, don't try to explain it. Don't try to explain anything. I'm just muddled up. I don't know what to do. Dorothy, don't run out on me. [barking] I-I got that dog on my hands. Oh! I don't know, for a smart guy, you're a first class... No, no, baby, I... If you had posted bail and kept your mouth shut we would have been out of here an hour ago. Oh, girls, ease up a little bit, will you? After all, when I started talking to that pleasant gentleman in the grey suit and told him what I thought of the police, how did I know he was the chief of detective? Oh, at the rate we're going to Del Mar I'll never make any money. Now, now, let's not lose our tempers. Well, for pity sakes, let's get going. In less than nothing flat, sweetheart. First we go to the barber's and then we'll really hit the open road. Here's the car, get your beautiful selves in there. There you are. Yeah, you in? Fine. Make them track, it was the last thing I'd do. [car engine revving] [instrumental music] - Oh, good afternoon, ma'am. - Good afternoon. But won't you come in? Mrs. Reed would want to thank you for being so kind. Well, some other time, please, ma'am. Right now, there's something important I have to do before 5 o'clock. - Very well. Goodbye. - So long. "Breakfast In Hollywood." Oh, I'm sorry, his line is busy. You're welcome. - Oh, Ms. Field. - Yes? This gentleman's waiting to see you. Excuse me, my name is Ken Smith. Is Mr. Breneman in? Do you have an appointment, Mr. Smith? No, I don't, but... Well, then I'm afraid he can't see you today. This is very important, miss. I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Breneman is a very busy man. - Could you come in tomorrow? - That won't do me any good. I'm in trouble. And tomorrow will be too late. - Well, what sort of trouble? - Girl trouble. Look, miss, you don't wanna see two people who really need each other, both end up with a kick in the heart do you? Wait a minute. - 'Yes.' - Excuse me, Mr. Breneman. There's a young sailor out here. Mr. Ken Smith. - 'Tell him to come in, please.' - Alright. You may go in. First door to the right. Thank you. [Tom] 'Hello, Ken, what's on your mind?' Hello, Mr. Breneman. Oh, boy, you sure got me into something. Now, you gotta help me out. I got you into something? What? You introduced me to Dorothy, that girl from Minneapolis? 'She won the wishing ring this morning, remember?' What happened? Her fiance show up? No, sir, and he isn't going to. [intercom buzzes] Yes? [Ms. Fields] 'I have a call on number three for you.' Alright, hold it now, I'll take it in just a moment. The fellow she was engaged to married somebody else and didn't tell her. I suppose you rectified that error. 'Well, how did you know?' I can tell by that sick look on your face. Oh, well, when I told her, she got me all wrong. She broke out crying and ran away. Well, what am I supposed to do about it? She's going back to Minneapolis tonight. Her bus leaves in 25 minutes. Will you go down and talk to her? - Will you explain to her? - Explain what? Can't you see what she means to me? If she gets on that bus tonight... Look, there's only 20 minutes left. - 'Mr. Breneman.' - Yes? That party is still waiting on the phone. - They say it's urgent. - Okay, I'll take it right now. This isn't just a crush, I'm goofy about her. This morning when I met you, I had nothing to gamble for. Now, I've got everything. You're not gonna let me blow it without getting a fair shake for it, are you? You're the gabbiest guy I've ever met. I'll tell you what to do. You go to the bus depot. - Hold it till I get there. - Okay. And I'll be over just as soon as I answer this phone call. Oh, gee, Mr. Breneman, you're the... All day you go gab, gab, gab. Now, go on and beat it. I'll be over in a few minutes. And look, don't try to be persuasive. - Be yourself. - Okay. So long. That telephone call? - You can take it here, sir. - Thanks. Hello? Mr. Breneman, this is Mrs. Reed's nurse. I'm a little worried, Mrs. Reed has had a peculiar spell and I've called the doctor. I wonder if you could come over for a few minutes? Oh, you bet, I will. - I won't be gone long. - 'Alright.' [instrumental music] Won't you just look at me a minute? I can hear you without looking at you. Ms. Dorothy, I didn't tell you about Jimmy just because... Oh! I've already told you it's unimportant anyway. Now, what more can I say? Well, you could tell me you're not angry with me. Can't you see I don't want to talk to you? Oh, excuse me. Say, do you know Tom Breneman? What does he look like? Well, he's, uh, uh... - Oh, skip it. - Sorry. [male #1] 'Phoenix, Flagstaff, Albuquerque' 'Kansas City, Chicago, aboard.' Annie, you're a bad girl. You're not trying, and you know it. Oh, I'll be alright. Well, you don't sound very convincing. You're not putting up a fight at all. I've been fighting for 82 years. I could give you a good spanking for talking like that. To win a battle you've got to have something to fight for. You see, Tippy's the only one that needs me and... he's lived his life too. Oh, you're talking through your hat. We all have work to do. We have people who need us. No, that's a lot of nonsense. You're right, it is a lot of nonsense. I guess, you and I are both fed up with this good neighbor stuff. That's right. Thank golly, Annie, I wish I could be more like you. Then maybe, I'd have some sense too. [chuckles] Well, you've faced facts. Your work is done. Why stick your nose into somebody else's business? Well, have a good night, honey. I think I will. I feel sleepy now. So, I'll get back to the office. Let somebody else help him. Goodnight. Help who? Oh, I was just thinking out loud. Goodnight. - Wait a minute. - 'Yeah?' Who's in trouble? Oh, I don't wanna bother you with it. You're tired. Now, you come back here and tell me. I want to know. Who's in trouble? Well, you remember the young sailor and the girl from Minneapolis with the program this morning? I most certainly do. What a mighty cute pair they were too. Well, the boy got a crush on the girl and they've had a quarrel and she's going back to Minneapolis tonight. Oh, what a pity. Yes, he's been over at the office mooning around. Wants me to help him. He'd think it was the end of the world. Well, to two young people in love a quarrel is the end of the world. Well, let's forget about him. I've gotta go back to the office. - Now, if you want anything... - Wait. - I got an idea. - Yeah? You go and get those two young people and bring them here... ...and I'll bet you, I can get them together again. Well, I wouldn't think of it. You're a sick woman. Now, if you say that again I'm gonna get right up, and go get them myself. Are you sure you wanna be bothered? Just a moment ago, you said... Oh, that was just a lot of talk. Now, please do me the favor and go get them, and bring them here. Alright, but you're forcing me. [male #1] 'San Francisco, Sacramento, Salt Lake City.' Shiyan, Omaha, Minneapolis, aboard. Look, if I write you a letter in care of Dock's Hamburger joint, will you answer me? No. - Gosh, not-not even a postcard? - No. Alright, sailor, will you get in or out, please? Okay, okay. Sorry, buddy, no loafing on the platform. [engine revving] [instrumental music] Oh, brother, is this a happy day? Jim Jam won the first race in Del Mar. [laughs] Oh, Ken. Just a moment, please. I'm awfully sorry, I'm late, but I really have a good excuse. - Yeah, sure, it's okay... - No, tell me what happened. Look, let's just forget about it... No, no, don't be that way, Ken, I wanna know, really. Look, Mr. Breneman, I know you're a good guy but it's too late for talk now, she's gone. I'll see you around sometime. - But look... - Mr. Brememan! - What a lovely coincidence... - You'll have to excuse me... You know, I just bought a new hat and the lady said I look just like a pangram. - Well, that's nice, yes... - Mr. Bren... Would you go across the street, Mr. Brememan, and take a look? I wanna see if it'll make you laugh! Uh, not now, please. Bring it down to the restaurant tonight, I'll have more time. - Tonight? - Yes, and the name is Breneman. Bye. Bre... Bren... Brema... Brumama... Well, pardon me, lady. Uh... Brum... Larsen. L-A-R-S-E-N. Larsen. She's on the Salt Lake bus, left Hollywood at 5 o'clock. Oh, thank you, sergeant. You're doing Mayor of Encino a big favor. Bye. You know of any other place where a sailor who's lost his girl might go? No. Unless maybe a cocktail bar. Why, sure he would! What's the matter with us? Let's start phonin' 'em right now. There's only 900 of them in and around Hollywood. Well, try it, anyway! Tell 'em it's for "Breakfast In Hollywood." And tell 'em we'll give a reward to anybody who brings Ken to the phone. 'How much?' Well, two tickets to the radio show, of course! What do you expect, a half interest in the joint? Oh, my! I'd hardly know it's me. You've changed my whole appearance. You have [indistinct] It is just that you have been neglecting to bring them out to good advantage. Oh! I can hardly wait till my husband sees me. Why not surprise him? Telephone him, have him meet you someplace for dinner. I can't. He's out of town. Oh, but my dear, with that beautiful hair surely you are going somewhere tonight. I'm afraid not. I'd like to have my bill, please. - Very well, we will get it. - Thank you. [instrumental music] Well, it is a pity. Such a lovely makeup and hairstyle just cries to be taken out. I'm sorry, I'm afraid it'll have to wait. You see, I'm a little old fashioned. I don't believe in wives gallivanting around while their husbands are away. Working as hard as mine does. I understand perfectly, dear. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - And come again. - Oh, indeed I will. - Thank you, Mrs. Cartwright. - Thank you. [men laughing] And when we come out of the police station and find out I'm out of gas... ...well, those two little lollipops could have kicked a hole in a battleship with a moccasin. [laughter] - They walked right out on you? - Are you kidding? They don't walk out on a man like Mr. Cartwright. He knows how to handle... [Richard] 'Ah, you're right about that time, Herman.' Well, right now, those two little sweet petunias are sitting out front, so sorry they'd do anything for me... '...but my laundry.' [Herman] 'Doggone, Mr. Cartwright!' You sure know how to handle 'em! He's certainly got those two eating out of his hands. Well, you might I say it's a gift I was just naturally born with it. - Excuse me, Mr. Cartwright? - Yes? But the lady sittin' outside in your car say that if you don't come out in two minutes they're gonna come in and wipe up the floor... with you! Eh, you better forget the shampoo, Herman and let me get out of here. No need carrying the punishment to the point of cruelty. What can I do for you, please? Oh, good evening. If you and your girlfriends think it's going to be one, you're optimistic. Egads! That was my wife. [chuckles] [siren wailing] [tires screeching] What's wrong, officer? You got a passenger by the name of Larsen? 'A young lady going to Minneapolis?' Is there a Ms. Larsen on board? My name is Larsen. - Ms. Dorothy Larsen? - That's right, uh... - Why? Something that matter? - Do you know Tom Breneman? Why, yes, I was in his radio broadcast this morning. Okay, lady, I'm sorry but you'll have to come back to Hollywood with us. What for? Step outside and I'll tell you. [instrumental music] What is this? What's happened? It's about a ring. Mr. Breneman claims you stole one from him! - Oh! - Come on.

I'm afraid the news isn't so good. What's wrong? Mr. Breneman missed the bus. The girl left, and the boy has disappeared. Oh, no. Mr. Breneman's had the girl arrested and she's being brought back to Hollywood by subterfuge. - Did you say arrested? - Yes. Oh, it's bad. That's what it is. [sighs] Hello, Tippy. Brought you a bone. Yeah. I saved that for you. Do you like that, boy? [Ken] 'Go ahead.' 'Here. Yeah.' 'Think you're gonna like that, huh?' 'Oh, that's a good one. Yeah.' [Annie] Is that you, young man? Oh.

Oh, but I saw her leave on the bus myself. - I was with her until... - Maybe so. But they're bringing her back to Hollywood under subterfuge. When you say they, do you mean the police? Mm-hmm. Two of 'em big cops. They took her off the b... They yanked her off the bus under very extenuating circumstances. But why? What's she done? Something to Mr. Breneman. What? I don't know. They're being awful secret about it. Oh, they are, are they? Well, that means they're trying to pin something on her. The very thing I said to myself when I heard it. Oh, you can bet your life, if I had my strength I'd be right down there with bells on 'em. But where are they taking her? I don't know exactly, but I'd go to Mr. Breneman and find out. I will, and don't you worry, Mrs. Reed, I'll find her. [instrumental music] [music continues] Oh, excuse me, but, uh, have you, by any chance seen a lady in here by the name of Cartwright? What do you think this is? The Bureau of Missing Persons? - I don't know... - What does she look like? She's the most beautiful woman in the world. Why don't you try Tom Breneman's?

Well, as a matter of fact, I'm, uh, I'm looking for my wife. It's quite a long story. Well, this sounds like a good story. You couldn't have chosen a better person. - What's her name? - Cartwright. But she probably isn't using it now. Well, uh, what does she look like? Oh, she's out of this world. She's gorgeous. This, I must see. Come on, I'll help you track her down! Oh, but excuse me, it's because of this and that that I'm looking for her now. Eh, thank you. [chuckles] [gasps] You're Hedda Hopper, aren't you? Well, I was when I left home this morning. You know, I'm one of your most ardent fans. - You mean you were. - What? Oh, look what I've done to your hat. Oh, that's perfectly alright. It wasn't silly enough, anyway. Oh, it couldn't have come to a happier end. Well, of course, I'll replace it. Oh, no, but Ms. Hopper, you don't have... Oh, I ruined yours, and I insist upon giving you mine. A Hedda Hopper hat? Oh, well, you've been so swell about it I wonder if that will be silly enough. - Do you think so? - On you, it looks good. - Hopper. - Oh, thank God. [instrumental music] Oh, Frances! Oh, there you are, darling. I beg your pardon. Oh, come now, let's not be ridiculous. Why, I've been worried sick about you. Oh, please don't bother to sit down. I'm just about to leave. Well, after all, my dear, fun is fun but this is becoming ludicrous. - Your cab is here, ma'am. - Oh, thank you. As your husband, may I be so nosy as to enquire where you're going? Oh, I don't know. The Macombo. Maybe Cheryl's. - I don't know yet. - Well, may I accompany you? Oh, I'm afraid not. You're hardly dressed for the occasion. Ta-ta! Don't cry, but she had me tell the cab company she wanted to go to 26 Canyon Drive. 26 Canyon Dri... Why, that's our home. - First door to the right. - Thank you. - Is this her, Tom? - This is the girl, alright. How can you have me arrested when I haven't done... Now, wait a minute. Take it easy. Officer, do you mind if I have a few words with her? - You wait right here. - Not at all. What is this all about? You know I didn't steal that ring. You gave it to me. No, but you did steal something else. The heart of a swell kid. Ken Smith. Is this your idea of humor? Bringing me all the way back here just to tell me that? I'm not trying to be funny, this is serious. Serious for both you kids. I don't see why you had to know anything about it. Well, then, as much as I started this thing I thought I'd help to bring it to a happy ending. I'm sure you meant well, Mr. Breneman, but... Well, really, there isn't anything that can be done. After all, he knew I was engaged to somebody else. He knew the fellow you were engaged to married somebody else. That's what Ken knew. Oh, I don't know. [sobs] Oh, let's be sensible about this thing, Dorothy. You're in love with Ken, and I know it. - What makes you think so? - Those tears. Here, honey, have one on me. Thanks. Dorothy honey, the only reason I had you brought back I want you kids to have the chance you are both entitled to. Where's Ms. Larsen? I'm sorry, with Mr. Breneman. Why? What's the idea of arresting her? What did she do? Why, are you a friend of hers? I sure am, and I'd like to know what this is all about! 'Hey, come here!' Why, you big phony, I'll show you a... Ken. Ken, stop it! - He's only trying to help! - What do you mean? It's alright, officer, anything can happen in here. It usually does too. I was told he had you arrested. He just had me brought back because you asked him to. - Shall I take him outside? - No, let him stay. The excitement's all over. This thing'll settle down to a good old fashioned family fight. - 'Then you won't need me?' - No. Thank you very much, officer. You've done Mayor of Encino a great turn tonight. - Not at all, Your Honor. - Goodnight. I only asked him to talk to you. You wouldn't listen to me. Because I'm not interested in anything you're trying to say. Can't you get that through your head? Gee, I'm sorry, Mr. Breneman, but... Gosh, now what do I do? The only thing a gentleman can do. - Leave her alone? - No. Give her a chance to change your mind. - But she just walked out. - Only to be followed. Well, how do you figure that? Holy mackerel, am I dumb? Gee, I'd like to feel like that just one more day before I die. [instrumental music] - Dorothy. - Yes? - You forgot your pocketbook. - Oh, so I did. Thanks. You're welcome.

Yes? You're probably gonna laugh. About what? About me. I figure if you're my age I had to start to think a little bit about serious things. Such as? Oh, you know about future and lot of things. Like, uh, settling down and maybe someday having a home of your own. That sounds wonderful, Ken. You know, what I really need to make my post war plan complete, don't you? No. What? You. Well, how about it? Bend your head over. I wanna whisper something. You know, we've only known each other about 14 hours. You'll have to give me a little time to think it over. - Okay. How long? - Oh. Three to four minutes. [chuckles] Well, they kissed, and I hope will live happily ever after. Oh, Mrs. Reed will be so happy to hear it. 'She's asleep now.' 'Thank you for calling.' 'Goodnight.' - Goodnight, pop. - Goodnight, pop. Goodnight, girls. Goodnight. Gee, pop, what a day. 'Well, you're through for the night, Tom?' - Yeah, all through. - Oh, see, Tom. I've been wanting to tell you this. You know, me and ma sure like you're radio program. Well, thanks, pop. Look at that time, and me up at 5:00 a.m. in the morning. Yeah, some of more gags and crazy hats and foolishness... Yeah, some problems and heartache and headache and whatnot. Pop, by golly, that's what makes the world go round. And me with it. [laughter] - Goodnight, pop. - 'Goodnight, Tom.' You old scallywag, you. - Mr. Brememan? - Oh, no, not you. I just wanted to tell you that Ms. Hopper sat on my pangram hat. Well, that's too bad you weren't wearing it at the time. Oh, yes, but she gave me this one. Would you mind trying it on so I could tell my friends that you wore? - Oh, thank you, Mr. Brememan. - You're welcome. Oh, you do kiss the ladies whose hat you try on, don't you? Oh, why not, everything else just happened to me today. Thank you, Mr. Brememan. Oh, the name is Breneman, honey. Goodnight. Mr. Breneman. [instrumental music]
