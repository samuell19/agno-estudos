He just winked at me, right? Stop! Thank you. Oh. Same floor? Are you a salesman? What's with that disgusted face? Ah. I guess I do stink. It can't be helped. I drank 'till morning and didn't take a shower. Toga-san. It smells nasty here. You still haven't quit drinking, huh? Oh! So you are not a salesman? Didn't I tell you that we have new people coming in today. This is Shima-kun. Shima-kun. Shima-chan. I'm Togawa. Don't call me "section manager". It makes me sound old. Toga-san. If you want to smoke, go to the smoking area. Didn't boss said he will fine you if he sees you smoking again. Toga-san, can you check this for me? Okay. I will be right there. What's your name again? Shima. That's it? Where's the "Please take care of me"? With that attitude... I can't believe you passed the interview. Do you have some impressive skills? Well. They are okay. Woah. I thought you used your cute face. Don't be too nervous. So annoying. Welcome. Shima-kun, welcome to our company. Cheers Thank you. So good. Shima, is there something you want to eat? No, not really. Takada, Just order something. Sure. Why juice? I don't drink alcohol. No way. What about beer? Can you drink beer? I don't like the smell of beer. Even just the smell on someone. What about cigarettes? I don't smoke. You're just as innocent as you look. Toga-san, why don't you learn from him? No way. I get lonely easily. I can't imagine my life without alcohol. If you're lonely,why don't you just get a wife? You are popular with the ladies. Wife? I want one. Takada, Introduce one to me. I don't want to. You are too picky. Am I? Sakita-san also had a shotgun wedding, right? Sakita is a girl who worked here before you. Have you gotten used to the job yet? Yeah. Not bad. I see. Onoda told me you have an impressive resume. Thank you. Where did you work before coming here? A company called TAG. TAG? That's a huge company. Were you fired? It's not like that. Then what is it? What are you doing? My glass is empty. You could have just said it. Your face is too close to me. Why can't you just hand it to me? Which reminds me. Takada, didn't you go get facials? How was it? Does it even work? Onada-san! Why do you have to bring that up now? Who cares about you getting facials. Just get me more beer. Yes sir. Thank you for your hardwork today. Ummm. About earlier... I'm sorry. What about? Umm...No. Nevermind. Thank you for the welcome party. Toga-san! Sakita is here. Sakita! Are you feeling well? Yes, Both mother and child are well. How old is he? Around 5 months. Let me hold you. Ah sorry, sorry. Good boy. Come here. He's crying. Somebody hold him. Mom always knows best. Kids are really something, huh? They can grow up even if their parents aren't around, but you can't be a parent if you don't have kids. You are right. Sorry, sorry. Learn from the mistake. Oh! Shima went through that? Yeah. He can never forget about it. You mean his ex-boyfriend? No. The pain he gave him. I can't do anything for him. If I were you... I don't think there would be anything I could do either. I'm going now, so take care of things here. Okay. Have a nice trip. Be safe. What's wrong with Toga-san? He's wearing a suit. He's going on a business trip to Kyoto. He'll be away for awhile. A while? For how long? What? Nothing. Well. I just wanted him to look over some documents. Oh. So it's like that? He will probably come back in two weeks. I see. Shima-chan. Yes. Toga-san is back. How was Kyoto? How were the Geishas? I didn't have time for that. But...their dialects were really cute. Takada. Yes. Do you have cigarettes? I'm out. Sure. Sorry about that. No problem. Shima, How are you? Fine... It's been 2 weeks and that's all I get from you? But Shima has been lonely. What? This guy? I wasn't lonely. You are really cute. What kind of expression do you have? Oh right. I bought souvenirs. Kyoto sake. But I want to eat Yatsuhashi. I didn't bring any. What? Kyoto is famous for their Yatsuhashi. I didn't think men liked that stuff. Toga-san. What is it? Sorry to bother you at this time, but...this is important. Okay. No problem. Not bad. Thank you. You still have the same expression as earlier. Let's go eat lunch together. I already bought it. re-sync by yuki881 Shima! Do you want a cigarette? You know that I don't smoke. Then... let's go to the restroom together. No, thank you. Then... What do you want? Why are you always giving me the cold shoulder? Well. I have the right to. On the contrary... I think you really care about me. It's not like I'm trying to pick you up. I didn't think that. Then let's go eat dinner. Okay? Okay. let's go! Do you live with your family? No. I live alone. Do you even eat properly? I do. Excuse me! Coming... One more beer please. What about you, Shima? I don't drink. Right You hate the smell, right? The smell of smoking too! I don't like it. Then let's buy an air cleaner. Since everybody in our department do smoke. Company banned smoking, right? Well... I guess. Is there something on my hand? I'm sorry. I just spaced out. You... You never look me in the eyes when you talk? But, you are always watching me when you think I'm not looking. I don't look at you. You are thinking too much. Really? You are over conceited. If I'm over conceited then you must be over "caring". I never cared. Really? Not caring at all? Boring. Ah. It's burning. So full. Thank you for treating me today. You are going that way, right? Yes Then... Goodbye. Sorry I know you didn't want to come here, yet I forced you. Next time...Let's bring everyone along. Okay. Then, Goodbye. You're not going back? I'm going. They saw us. What...are you doing? Kiss. That I know. I just went with the flow. The flow? Don't you feel embarrassed? Doing this at this kind of place? Then, let's go somewhere where we can't be seen. No... Wait... Toga-san! I didn't mean it like that. This is the worst. The smell of smoking. The smell of beer. The smell of BBQ. You talk too much when you are nervous. What am I going to do with you? I was always thinking about... doing weird things with you. Are you... Are you gay? Yes. How about you? You're not, right? Let's be honest. I'm your type, right? Not at all. More like the exact opposite. Liar. I saw you looking me all the time. That... That was just a momentary confusion. But... I've come to my senses now. Stop lying. Don't worry. I just acted on impulse. You were too cute so I couldn't help myself. I'm not cute. Don't put the blame on someone else. Stay over tonight. Hey. It's a bit embarrassing ... still putting up family picture and all. But, everyone passed away. Everyone? When I was 7.... My father died in an accident. And my mom became mentally unstable. It was during a snowy day, you know? When I realized...there was already a sea of flames. Only me and my mom got rescued. My brother died. And... After that, my mother killed herself. As a child, I always thought about... why didn't snow put out the fire? I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing for? I'm sure you don't want to remember those memories. It's okay. I got used to people feeling sorry for me. To be honest, I want a real family. Why didn't you wake me up? I'm late because of you. It has nothing to do with me. Morning. Good morning. Shima-kun is really cute right? Not bad. His face is not bad. Toga-san. Do you know the reason why Shima quit his last job? I never really asked him. I heard he got bullied. Bullied? It seems like there was a rumor about Shima-kun dating a man in the same department. To kill that rumor... that guy was harsh to Shima. He told everyone that he was harassed by Shima-kun. Then, he blamed all the mistakes he made on Shima. He made it pretty hard for Shima to stay there. Well...it seems like they really were dating. And then? What do you want me to do? It's nothing. It's just... You are really protective of Shima. So troublesome! We've known each other for so long that you are able to see right through me. Then. I will be leaving now. Good work today. Take care You have been working here for so long and still making these mistakes? Did you get distracted by someone? I'm sorry about earlier. Don't hate me because of this. Shima. Yes? Hello. It's me. What is it? What are you doing right now? Watching TV. Ah... I see...you're mastrubating. I am not. What do you want? Say something. Aren't you're the one who called me? I guess you're right. Umm.. About yesterday... Come and pick me up. What? I'm at the station near your house. Why? Because I don't know where your house is. That's not what I meant. Come within 10 minutes. If you don't come, I will reduce your bonus. Why? I will reduce your bonus. I will reduce at least one thousand dollars. Do whatever you wish. Hello? About the bonus... I will leave that to you. Togawa Chief. I told you I will reduce it. But I didn't promise you I will increase it. You don't actually have the authority, do you? Shut up! Move a little. Unlike the one in your house, mine is a twin bed. So warm. It's hot, okay? Why do you always have that poker face? I do not. Is it because Onoda knows the truth? He knew? I'm not sure. You really hate it, huh? I think it's not a big deal. What did your ex say to you? Because of him... you quit your job, right? Onada's friend works at your old company. If you don't want to talk about it... it's fine. But.. I hate myself for liking men. I wish I'd never met you. Hey. Good morning. Good morning Toga-san is late again. He probably got a woman. What is it? Do you need something? It's nothing. How can I put this... It's written all over your face, you know? You have this poker face but it's still easy to read. I can't believe you guys actually hooked up. We didn't. Really? We are not dating. That's why... Oh! don't worry about it. I won't tell anyone. What did Shima say? He didn't deny it. But he also said you guys are not dating. And then? I hate being a whisper blower. I will give you bonus. You keep using that same old phrase. Believe me. I Ummm... I am gay. But he's not. He's just... momentary curious. He will get bored after a few days. Really? It might be opposite. Generally, people build up their feelings. Because...if there are no feelings, it's hard to maintain a relationship, right? That's why... I think he will get bored after a few days. Just for your information... He said you are the only one who will get bored. Shit! He's too cute. Toga-san! What? No smoking! Stop it! or you will be in big trouble if they find out. Really? Isn't that right, Shima? Yes. Why do you suddenly ask, Shima? Manager is scared to yell at you so... He took it out on Shima. Blah Blah Blah. Then what's the point of the smoking area? Something like that. Shima, is that true? Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? There's no use even if I said something. I get you! Then I will quit. Huh? I will quit smoking. Are you serious? It's impossible. No. I'm serious. Lately, I been thinking about quitting anyway. Perfect timing. Okay! Shima! Take this. If I ever want to smoke again, I will ask you for it. Take care of it well. You should at least tell me when you are going home. Why should I? Because we are going back to the same place. During that time, you must have thought I smelled really bad. Stop it. Why? It's just... It feels weird. Weird? You suddenly became so nice... and even quit smoking. Huh? I'm always this nice, okay? I will cook dinner tonight. Wait for me at home. I have to talk to the manager. I will catch up with you later! Sorry to bother. You're also smoking. Let's keep it between us. I heard you were nagging at my people about it. Ah....I thought I covered my tracks well. Anyway...back to business. Do you have plans for marriage? An arranged marriage? With my daughter. I don't need it. What did you say? She's only in first year in college, right? Yeah. What is it? Do you... like Kyoto? What? I'm back. Sorry that I'm late. Let's hurry up and make dinner. Ah. Nevermind. I will just eat you first. What a cold joke. What? What's wrong? You're acting weird. Nothing. I just realized that it's great.... that I met you. Shima! What's wrong? No way. Are you crying? I'm not crying. You're right. You're not crying. Instead... You're bawling your eyes out. Is that right? Yes. I understand. Shima! Let's go eat lunch together. I already bought it. Well... take it with you then I don't want to. Hurry up or I will eat your food. Where are we going? A nice place. This is the nice place? It's not bad, right? It's a public park. How am I going to eat this cup of noodles? I wonder how, too. Just eat my melon bread. I don't want to eat it. Why are we here? Shima. I'm... Here. Thank you ojiichan. -Ojiichan? -Hey. This is niichan. It's okay. Ojiichan is turning 30 years old soon. Time to become a dad anyway. Thank you. -I can't do it. -It's too hard, right? You.. What's up with that sad happy face? Not cute at all. I'm a man I'm not suppose to be cute. And...I'm not outgoing like you. Shima, what's wrong? I'm sorry. I have work to finish. I will go back now. Officials from the headquarter are interested in you. Well.. It's a good thing for you. You have no reason to reject, right? Welcome back. That was fast. Where's Toga-san? I came back here first. Are you okay? You heard right? About Toga-san moving to the headquarters. What? What? Are you telling me... you didn't know? I'm so sorry. I saw you two went out so I thought... Toga-san told everyone to stay quiet about it. So I thought he wanted to be the one to tell you about it. I'm glad that I met you! So he's thinking about breaking up? What is it? I want to see you today. Have you been waiting? No. I just got here. Wow. It's so rare that you said you missed me. I didn't say such things. But you wanted to see me. Yes. I wanted to see you. What's wrong with you? You're weird. Thinking that this will be the last time, and I can't seem to let it go. Congratulation on your promotion. Thank you for everything. Because of you I was very happy. Is it hard to say it to me? Actually you don't need to worry about it. I'm planning to end this... I like you. Don't act so surprise. My actions are not obvious enough for you? Why.. Why are you saying this now? Because I want to stay with you after this too. What are you saying? It's impossible. You don't know that. Because...aren't you straight? Shima. I... like you too much. Even including your past. And the fact that you're gay. Are you feeling sorry for me? I doesn't matter if it's sorry or love They are both feelings. I can't control my feelings for you. How about you? About you moving to the headquarters... Honestly I will get lonely. But ... I don't think this type of relationship will work. It's better that we break up. What are you saying? I don't understand. Are you even listening to me? I told you I still want to be with you. What I meant is... Our relationship is not stable enough to go long distance. Then... you are okay with breaking up? It's not even a break up. It's like... the only thing in this relationship is sex.. Listen! To tell you the truth.. I didn't love you in the beginning.. But I fell in love with you. The more I know about you, the more I.. Thank you! I'm happy to hear that. But... we are only dating because you are confused. Why don't you just go find a wife instead? What are you saying? If you still care about making a family. Huh? You...don't tell me this has always been bothering you. Because it's a stressful problem. I'm just a man. I can't give you a child. You are just wasting your time. Shima! Listen to me! Look at me. It hurts Shima! look at me carefully. Look at me! Look at me! Listen to me The problems that you had in your head, even if we didn't meet, you can easily get rid of them. How can I forget about it? My past... Your past.... They are all part of us, right? You been through so much.... And if you stay with me... Do you think I can forgive myself? Beside...We won't be together 'till death. So... It's better we don't start at all. It's enough. Shima. I have no right to change the way you think. So you also have no right to decide my love for you. I understand everything now, we are done. Ahh... Then..Let's do it one last time! Besides, we only have sex in this relationship, right? You came here for this right? For you... I'm just a friend-with-benefits. Stand up! You are really an asshole. You want me to hate you? Will you hate me? If so... will you always remember me? Hey, stop crying. No one is crying, alright? Really...no one! Stop lying... your voice just cracked. Why you have to say it out loud? Anyway...take care everyone. Give us a call when you get there. Toga-san, thank you for all your hard work. Take care! I will come and play. Are you serious? Goodbye Shima! Thank you for taking care of me. It's been a month since Toga-san left. Even chief is wearing a suit to work. I told you not to call me chief, it makes me sound old. Toga-san also said the same thing before. Good morning. Morning. You cut your hair. It got a bit long. re-sync by yuki881 I see Shima-kun, do you have a business card for ESUTEKKU? Ah...Yes. That's great! I have to go there today. But I don't know their address. I will give it to you now. Thank you! Shima-kun? Shima, what happens? Stomach! He said his stomach hurt. Sorry. I will go back to work now. Just take a day off today. Toga-san told me to take care of you. He told me not to leave you alone. And asked me to look after you. He said you liked being alone. But... I can't leave you alone even if he said that. My feelings for you are different from Toga-san's, but I really do care about you. I like you... like if someone said bad things about you... I will get mad. Here. So cold. I thought Kyoto would be a bit warmer. Hello I'm Shima. Long time no see. Long time no see. I'm sorry to call you at this late hour. Late? It's only nine o'clock. Right... I'm sorry. Your voice sounds so sad. Really? Yeah. What are you doing right now? Talking on phone. Yeah, you're right. You don't have some interesting answers? I'm alone. Don't copy my tone of voice. Sorry. You know... you keep apologizing from the start. Sorry. I told you to stop apologizing. Sorry. What're you apologizing for? Sorry. What is it with you? Shima! I'm hanging up. Are you thinking about just leaving like this? I thought... you had gotten mad. Mad? More like annoyed. Were you thinking of leaving everything behind after a new haircut? You really want to forget about me? I... I want to apologize to you. Ah...I feel more annoyed now. Just say it, I'm listening. I... To be honest... I'm weak. I Ignored your past. I only thought about me. I'm scared that you will hate me and leave me. I don't want to ruin your idea of having family. But... it's okay even if one day you don't like me anymore. I want to be with you, no matter what... even if there is no result between us. I will at least try... try not to become a burden for you. Shima! Do you like me? Yes. I like you. I thought we were really over. Me too. You... Are you really okay with this? You know..we both can live here together. I quit the last job. I don't want to repeat the same pattern. Besides I really like this job. Onoda-san is a great person. When I thought I could finally relax, you have to mention another guy. I can't believe it... You get jealous easily. It hurts! Cigarette. My mouth got lonely. It's okay. Smoke it if you like. I knew you will make a good wife. I guarantee. Thanks. I... I really hated snow. I don't have any good memories about it. Shima! Yes? Thank you!
