YO NOHARA Is it already that time? Thanks, I'm happy you remembered. Yeah, time flies. Hanging out in this crisis? You guys are insane. Let's hang out another time. Thanks for calling. I'll be in touch. See you, bye. Is it your birthday? Yes, I'm already 21 now. How's life for a girl riding a taxi at 21? Great! That's nice. Congratulations. I was about to die yesterday, though. What happened? ''I was sad and took too much sleeping pills.'' I actually have a kid, three years old. Don't die, it'll all be fine. How about you? Happy? You're in the way. She'll be here soon. Who's she? My wife, she'll be here soon. Please move, we're trying to clean up. ''She's coming. From the future.'' Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. You look tired. I couldn't sleep at all. Oh, birthday party? Yes, party until morning. I made it over 300 times. Wow, that's great. Two minutes, no mistakes. Better than a dancer. Of course not. I can't move anymore. I can't do lighting check. Can you, please? You're so out of shape. Yes, ok. Pushing back three minutes. Please watch your steps as you leave. Thank you very much. Izumi. Good job. That was great. I'm so proud of you, good job. Wasn't she great? The best I've seen so far. You've been working so hard. Theater, all clear. Did you lose your job? You look young. No, I've been at this for some time. ''Really? How's business these days?'' Pretty tough, especially at night. Right. ''Daytime is still better, but it's dead after midnight.'' Our show tonight was cancelled, too. ''Our agency has to refund the tickets, they might go under.'' Everyone's struggling. I hope the crisis ends soon. ''What a surprise that the Olympics were held.'' Sorry, can I take a toilet break? ''From 12 to 13 of the 9th part. Ok.'' ''The last chorus bit, no spotlight from 30 to 33 of the 9th part.'' No spotlight from 30 to 33, ok. We'll just have to wait it out. Yeah, I guess we have no choice. Let's see how things go. Monja. Monja. Monja? No Monja, not that. ''Free tonight? Having drinks with guys!'' Good morning. Is your birthday this month? Yes. Then 10% discount for you. Really? - ''-You decline? - Of course not, thank you.'' When? Yesterday. ''Too bad, if it was today, it would've been 20% off.'' ''I'm sorry, I lied. It's actually today.'' ''What, Mom? Did you eat already?'' Phone's ringing. ''No peeking! Where's the ashtray?'' There. ''Leave it where it is. Gimme.'' Are you ok? Got a call. Yes, I knew it. Done. Looks good. Thank you. Don't forget those. What's that? A girl's thing? A barrette. I guess I don't need it anymore. Mom, so what about dinner? ''If I die I'm bound to go to hell There's no heaven anyway'' ''For some reason, just remembered the pattern of the curtains in your room'' ''Just sat there waiting for you to come back home'' ''Pathetic days Pointless days'' ''All the while, time goes on After all, I'm doing ok'' Is that ugly dog of yours doing well? He never liked me My true self had been showing all along ''The secret intercom I hid deep in my heart'' I jokingly rang it and ran off ''The reason why the picture looks so corny is'' ''Because it means love me for who I am, right?'' ''More than 80% of my joy More than 80% of my sorrow'' ''More than 80% of my pain Was all about you'' It's raised. Raised! Not that! The angle! Tilt it up! ''The secret intercom I hid deep in my heart'' I did press it at that moment ''The reason why the picture looks so corny is'' ''Because it means love me for who I am, right?'' ''Treated like a bug at work Treated like a pet dog by you'' ''This song is my last resort Gonna give it all I got'' ''Paying the booking fee with the money you earned'' I'm heading home now ''My favorite movies My favorite music'' ''My favorite comic books My favorite novels'' They're all in your room They were always there in your room How stupid can I be? My true self had been showing all along And about what I said earlier ''Please forget it because it makes me cringe'' I asked you to keep it a secret Please don't tell anyone I'm doing alright now I'm pretty happy now Saeki! You klutz! The spotlight's off! - ''-I'm sorry. - Cut the crap, not your hair, you dimwit!'' Yes, I'm sorry. Excuse me... I'm sorry about the lighting miss. It was only soundcheck, no problem. - ''-It was good lighting. - Really? Thank you.'' I'll pass it on to my boss. Some people still say ''dimwit,'' huh? ''She's always serious when it comes to lighting.'' She's pretty cool. Sorry, but... Have we met before? I have a feeling we have. Sorry, can't recall. ''Excuse me. Looking forward to the show.'' Teruo? ''Long time no see, Izumi. How are you?'' - ''-You cut your hair. - Just today.'' Really? Wow. - ''-Something good happened? - Why?'' You were grinning. Really? No, not at all. - ''-That's why you're drinking? - No, no.'' A lot goes on in an adult's life. In a university student's too. I'm drinking with my friends. Sorry to bother you. - ''-I'm now over the drinking age. - Congratulations.'' - ''-Do you have time tonight? - Yeah, I do.'' Let's get a drink. I usually cruise around at night. So the hours aren't fixed? Yes, it's quite easygoing. What makes you happy? I would say... Narita. Narita Airport. - ''-As a destination? - Yes.'' So it's money, after all. Narita's far. Yes, it is. ''But further than that would be a pain to drive back.'' ''From Narita, it's just straight back on the highway.'' ''If you want money, I can introduce you a job.'' ''I need money but it's not important for me.'' I simply like this job. Right. What do you like about it? I'd like to travel somewhere but I don't know where to go. So it feels nice to ''keep heading towards a destination of the customers' choice.'' ''Makes me feel like I'm constantly heading somewhere.'' Dance transcends words or language. I can't speak English but ''I can talk to people all over the world through dance.'' ''After I graduate, I want to try dancing overseas.'' I'm already invited. Wow, that's great. A bit alcohol heavy. Still with the same group? No, I work in stage lighting now. You quit dancing? After you left, I injured my foot. How badly? Bad enough to have to give up. I'm so sorry... Yeah, but it's fun lighting the stage. ''It feels like I'm almost breathing and dancing with the performers.'' I'm still new at it, though. That's why the hair cut? ''No, just because I had a birthday discount.'' Wait... today? Don't you need to be somewhere else? Sorry it has to be here. I'm too old for birthdays anyway. ''I'm sorry I didn't realize. Congratulations.'' - ''-Congratulations. - Thanks.'' - ''-It's like I'm forcing you guys. - Delighted to.'' I can't eat this cake alone now. I made that. I like chocolate. ''I know, just wanted to try it out on you.'' Let's try it together. Ok, just one bite. Look this way. It's maybe a bit dark... Your faces don't show. Hey, can I move that? Lighting man in action. What a craftsman. Is this better? Great but now the spotlight's on me. The most horny seems to be blood type A. Really? Who said so? I say so. ''I made a pie chart of my experiences and the most was blood type A.'' What blood type are you? What? Me? Type A. - ''-I'm doomed. - Pervert!'' How about Ena? I'm type A too. Really? The pervert duo. How about Yo? Type A. ''Pervert trio! Ok, let's play a game.'' ''Touch the hand of the guy you fancy in order.'' - ''-Here it comes. - It's just a game.'' Then, Ena first. Ok, good work. My turn now. Here you go. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Group date? Well, yes. How's it going? Well, so-so. Mine's horrible. Is it? There's a girl that came with her kid. ''To a group date. I don't get it.'' ''Everyone just touching their phones, what a waste of time.'' I wish I could date a celebrity. Celebrities don't come here. But don't you wish too? Why would I think so? Because they're famous. ''It's like a dream come true to date them.'' ''Even if you break up, every time you see them on TV,'' ''you'll feel proud to have dated them and feel great.'' - ''-I kinda get it. - Yeah?'' Yo, going to the next bar. Have to go back to hell. Let's be friends on Line. ''Just to... You do use Line, right?'' - ''-Well, yeah. - Then let's just be friends.'' The more the merrier on Line. Ok, my QR code. I'll scan it. Thank you. You have a cat? Not anymore. But... Oh, he's someone else's. Your ex-boyfriend? Well... sort of. ''Dwelling on him? That's heavy.'' No, not dwelling. Heavy? Don't you feel heavy? ''I just forgot about the pic. Here, changing it now.'' Yes, let's change it now. Oh, my collection... ''Are you an old lady or what? This, here.'' - ''-Born in the 20th century? - At the very end of it.'' Any pic is ok? Then this one. There you go. Done. - ''-You're still dwelling. - I am not.'' From now on, it's this. Forget the past. You have no right to tell me to forget. I'll text you every day. ''Everyday? We just met. Ok, then.'' I might not reply but ok. Summer has arrived. Ok... Have a nice summer. You're dwelling on the past. No, seriously I'm not. What's going on? ''I have a boyfriend now. That was a long time ago.'' How old are you? Teruo has a girlfriend too, right? Oh, well... She's happy, living strong. Right... I'm sure she is. ''Men fall in love with their dreams, right?'' What a funny way of eating. It tastes better this way. ''Didn't you think how nice it would be if you could eat'' all the cake you wanted to? I totally understand. I'm not asking you. Who are you? Who are you? What's with that face? ''I could bear anything if it was for dancing, not just cake.'' I wonder how I could bear so much. ''Now I can see dancing was a good opportunity for me.'' But you loved it, right? Enough to resist cakes. Your dancing was beautiful. Thanks. ''You have talent, Izumi, I think you'll do great.'' You have talent too. More than me, seriously. Who are you, seriously? ''But seriously, you have more talent than me.'' Wait, I'm over here. Izumi is over here. Teruo, don't mind him. You're so annoying. You guys don't even see me. That's not fair! Sorry, did I wake you? I will... make you happy forever. Thanks. I took a cigarette. This is sheer destiny. Come back when you're done smoking. THURSDAY 26, JULY Good morning. ''Kick up at 7. Ok, one more time.'' Over here? Yes, thank you. That'll be 1780 yen. I have a taxi ticket. Please write down the fare here. Thank you. I'll open the door now. Thank you. Is anything wrong? What? No. ''I don't want to go to cram school either, let's hang in there.'' Yes. Thank you. What did the doctor say? Don't dance anymore. It's not going back to normal. ''A healthy body is obviously important but'' ''you're working hard on rehab and we'll always help.'' Maybe we can lessen your parts to make it easier on you. How can you wait so long? Because I want to. You believe she's coming? Are you waiting as well? Yes... ''It's a miracle that there's someone waiting.'' But what if they don't come? ''Maybe it's good to go to them for a change.'' Why are you here? Taking you home. I need that leg. Really? You chatted with him? ''I greeted him this morning as well. He's amazing.'' ''He has total faith in her. I really hope they'll meet again.'' Did he remember you? Why haven't you replied? I'm sorry, was planning to today. It's not funny. I was worried about you so much. - ''-I'm fine. - No, you're not.'' I'm sorry. But give me a bit of time. I already have, two weeks. What exactly do you mean? I'm still flustered and broken. ''I didn't want to trouble you because of my situation.'' ''Trouble me. Let's think it out together.'' I want to, but I'm still... It's always about you. ''Taking it on alone and deciding by yourself.'' You're like a ''selfish machine.'' Always the cat, always bearing, always Yakitori. Is that about last month? ''The cheap grilled chicken bar, Toriki, even on days off.'' - ''-Then tell me. - Then ask me.'' Anyway, Toriki doesn't matter. ''You could be a movie star.'' I'm here to support you. Until you heal and even after you heal. Even if you can't dance anymore, ''we'll work as usual and live happily together.'' What do you mean? Exactly as I said. ''No matter how much you change, my feelings won't change.'' I'll still love you. ''If you'll love me if I change, then you don't love who I am now.'' Stop sounding like a girl. It's not about sexuality. I'm saying that I love who you are. ''So whatever Teruo you turn into, I'll still love you.'' It's pretty easy to imagine. Work as usual and have fun on days off. Sometimes cook up a meal. I love that Teruo as well. You don't know me as a non-dancer. What are you so angry about? Nothing. I'll still love you whatever you are. ''What is it? I can't understand if you won't tell me.'' Nothing... I'm sorry. I'm the one who doesn't understand. Why are you saying these things? Communication breakdown. Maybe we never did communicate. ''Do you know how worried I was these two weeks?'' Forget it. - ''-Forget what? - Nothing.'' ''I'm at the point of not knowing whether I can keep on dancing.'' ''I wanted to see you after everything's clear.'' ''Whether to keep dancing or to find something else.'' That's not what I want. ''You say it's for me, but it's all about you.'' ''Here we are, watch your step as you get off.'' That'll be 2240 yen, 2500 yen is fine. Why are you so extreme? Please get off. Hey, happy birthday, by the way. Let's get something to eat. I'm saying I'm sorry. Please understand I just need some time. And you don't come running after me. - ''-I'm into Tanaka. - He's popular.'' You gotta move fast. He'll definitely be into you. He just won't listen. ''No stopping him once he starts running.'' The youth are hopeless. What do you want to eat for dinner? Curry? Fried chicken? Where to next? You're fine, there's always the next one. Who's gonna trust a third-timer like you? Stop bullying me. If you need to throw up, I'll stop. ''Excuse us, driver, he just got divorced today.'' The world's full of cooler guys than you. Can I smoke? No, I'm sorry. Can you allow him just for today? Only one is fine. Hey, what's this? Sorry, I'll take that. This is nice, for you? That's garbage. He can have it as a divorce gift. I don't want this trash. Of course not, who'd want this? Please have it. Take her present, c'mon. Who'd want this garbage? Seriously, you can have it. It's a present. Take it! Just take it! Excuse me, just joking. Here, ashtray. ''To Teruo Good luck'' Teruo, you're late. Really? Seven minutes past. Seven minutes what? I don't know, but it's past the time. I have no idea. Did you sleep? I want to see Teruo. I'm here. When I sleep, I don't get to see you. Then... Let's meet in our dreams. Where in our dreams? In our dreams... On 3rd street, block 5-1. Where's that? Near the candy shop. Candy shop? Turn here, then turn around. Then go straight all the way up this road. Then what? Yo. Good morning, Yo. You're awake. Hey, Yo. What's this? Santa came? From Santa? Really? Santa Claus? He came through the window at night. Poor Santa, having to work on off season. What's this? - ''-Can I open it? - Yes.'' Santa... Wow, nice. Pretty. So beautiful. But what is it? A barrette. Here, let me. Let's try it on. Turn back? How is it? Really nice. It'll look good when you're dancing. I can't see but thank you. Happy birthday. It's time. ''Excuse us. If you like, please.'' Thank you. Oh right, today's... He never misses the monthly anniversary. Respect. Closed Is it ok to enter? I'll apologize if we get caught. This is amazing. ''Can they breathe with their mouths always open?'' ''Fish breathe with their gills, they're fine.'' What's that pack? Pilchards, true sardines. What's the black one? Beard grunt. ''It's rare that he's out here, he's usually hiding.'' Maybe he relaxes when there's no one. Why are you working here? These fish are free, but actually not. ''And they somehow make me feel free from gravity.'' But simply because I like fish. I like birds as well. Then let's go hiking. ''I like the sea better, let's go to the sea.'' And Battleship Island. That's a lot to visit. What about you, Yo? Let me see... I'd like to eat sushi. Don't say that in front of the fish. Doesn't it feel like we're the only people on Earth? Yeah, so cool. Right? - ''-But I feel it more than you. - No, I do.'' Teenager? ''I'm 30 today. I can say whatever I want.'' Hey, Teruo. Look. All mine. Show me your dance. What? Here? Then I'll dance. That's nice. What's that? A fish? Yes. Wait, hold on. Not here, I can't. ''You could be a movie star.'' ''I really wouldn't want to do that.'' ''''''I'm serious about this. Everyone wants to be a movie star.'''''' ''I'm not saying it right.'' ''''''I have everything planned out for me and it's going just right.'''''' Don't laugh, be serious. Sorry, you seemed to be enjoying it. You were in theater club, right? Careful! You're crazy! This is scary. Yeah, Jim made me an offer. Jim Jarmusch? I can only say Jim. Oh right, Jim Carrey? ''This is great but you sure it's ok with the taxi?'' I begged my boss. - ''-And he said ok? - Nope.'' If they find out, I'm fired. You're insane. ''''''Like I told you, I'm gonna be a mechanic.'''''' The camera's still rolling. How is this night sky drive, sir? It's the best. Wow, so many stars. It's like driving on the milky way. The backstreet route. Doesn't it take longer? Avoiding traffic. Oh, I see. So sir, where to? ''Then... To beyond that star.'' Fasten your seatbelt, please. Now you're fired. Yes, I'm totally screwed. ''You could be a movie star.'' ''''''Like I told you, I'm gonna be a mechanic.'''''' Pretty. I'm gonna get burned. Pretty. Twirl around. What's the matter? Just thinking... People are living. What? Just thinking you're beautiful. Shut up. Teruo... Please stay well, tomorrow too. What's gotten into you? And the day after tomorrow too. Please keep on living forever. You too, Yo. Health is my strong point. ''Winona Ryder is so cool, she sticks to her guns.'' Yeah, she's cool. I don't even have a life plan. I'm just detouring life smoothly. ''I'd take up the movie star offer, even if I can't be.'' Of course you can be. Definitely want a family... Nothing. ''Which do you prefer, subtitles or overdubs?'' Subtitles. Why? I can focus more on the movie. And can hear their own words. Why are there so many languages? What do you mean? ''If everyone spoke the same language, it'd be easier.'' ''But words don't always convey true feelings or thoughts.'' Some things don't even need words. Silence doesn't work. I'm watching the movie. Only three long candles seem sad. Maybe. Was it better with 30 short candles? Let's do that on your birthday. Please don't, seriously. Strawberry? - ''-Good. - So good.'' I'll propose on next year's birthday. - ''-What? - Did I say something?'' Wait, yes, you said something. - ''-No, I didn't. - Yes, you did.'' - ''-Did I? - What did you just say?'' You said something. ''Don't fool me. You taste like strawberry.'' You mean on your birthday next year? Mine? Mine's in May. Next year or tomorrow... Tomorrow? Tomorrow? Can't wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow's very soon. Tomorrow... Really? Great. Again? Isn't it too much? - ''-No? - Not saying no.'' - ''-So it's ok? - Yes.'' - ''-You taste like cake. - You too.'' TUESDAY 26, JULY - ''-What about tomorrow? - Lesson, then work.'' - ''-Ok. - Tomorrow's rain, take care.'' ''Do you mind if I take the backstreets to avoid traffic?'' Ok, then we can meet at 5 o'clock? Yeah, it's all fine. Make yourself squeaky clean, ok? Ok, see you later. It's me. I'll be late today, have a meeting. I'll eat with Yuka tomorrow. What? It's work, I have no choice. Excuse me. ''The taxi driver's pretty rough. No, I'm ok.'' Anyway, tell Yuka for me, ok? Teruo. What's going on? No way. Happy birthday. - ''-Thanks. - That's expensive stuff.'' I worked hard for that. Ok you guys, photo. You're too nice. Please open it later. Too rigid, smile more. Say cheese. Thanks so much. ''You're welcome. Please open it when I'm not around.'' Teruo, let's go. Are you ok? Yes, she said she's gonna get umbrellas. Your wife? Please wait in my taxi. She'll be back very soon. - ''-But... - I'm fine.'' Take this while I go look for her. ''Teruo, come out with us for your birthday party.'' Thanks, but I have work. From when? Soon. Thanks anyway. Good luck with work. Thanks again for the present. - ''-Gotta go. - Yes, good night.'' Over here! What a relief. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I'm glad you met each other. Thanks. ''Thank you. Finally, we found each other.'' Thank you. Really? Then all's well. ''But my figures today were bad. My boss was furious.'' There are days like that. It was pointless to go look for her too. That's not true. ''They met because you helped his wish come true.'' That's how things go. He always comes there every year on the same day they first met. That's called love. Love is such a convenient word. I guess you don't understand love yet. Love? Is love something to cling on to? It's not about doing something. ''It's not about demanding something in return too.'' After all, love is an escape route. Is it? That's why it's good. Everyone's not that strong. Caring for each other. Trusting each other. What connects people are feelings and thoughts. ''It all falls down as soon as you put words...'' There goes the truth. You're such a wise man. Who's secretly in love. Still secret? I might give up soon. I'm a sucker for cute smiles. How's it going now? It doesn't matter. What about you? I don't know what he's thinking. You're not together yet? Ignoring him right now. - ''-Had a fight? - Not really.'' - ''-Teruo's not coming today? - He's working.'' Right, Tuesday. I don't get it. He does contact me but remains distant. At least, that's the vibe I'm getting. ''I'm scared I'll lose myself if we get closer.'' Ouch. ''It's his birthday, I'll give him a little reply.'' ''But he doesn't seem like the birthday type.'' That's not for you to decide. Good evening. Hey, good evening. I'm starving. ''What's the matter? Meat or rice?'' Argh, both. Both, ok. Ok then, time to take a hint. How about a drink? Wheat soda and two lemon slices. Two lemons, ok. - ''-Why so hungry today? - Didn't have time to eat.'' Nohara-san, what's up? - ''-What's this? - Why? Wait.'' Wait! Hey, stop! - ''-Why are you running? - Why are you chasing me?'' - ''-Because you're running. - Because you're chasing me.'' What's the matter? Bad day at work? You're all sweaty. It stinks. I'm so sorry. Painful. Ok. Regretful. Regretful. Stupid. I'm the stupid one. What are we? ''Sorry, don't answer. I'm so stupid.'' But your heart's already saying it. What? Shut up. Let your heart speak too. What's this? Birthday present. This is way too much. Thanks, I'm so happy. What is this? It's not rolling back. Thanks. It stopped raining. What are you thinking now? ''Don't you think he's a bit slow from a pro's point of view?'' Just that? But really... Ouch. Please stop here. Since we became really close, ''I thought it would screw things up if I say so.'' But I need to tell you. This is like a romance film. ''There should be some nice music playing now.'' What? Sorry, go on. So... I want to be honest with you. What? I kinda lost it right there. - ''-Huh? - Nothing.'' What? - ''-Nothing. - What?'' Nothing. You can't back down now. What? ''I'm sorry, but it's better to say things when you still can.'' I stopped the meter. So... I don't want you to go home tonight. I mean... ''How you say everything that's on your mind.'' How you act before thinking. ''How you act strong when you're actually scared.'' And also... How you laugh about everything. How you start dancing suddenly. I love your strange voice. And your name, Yo Nohara. - ''-Keep on going. - What?'' And so... - ''-It's time for you to go. - I know.'' Then hurry up. I'm sorry. - ''-I'm going now. - Good luck.'' Your drink bottle. Good luck. For you. Beautiful. Thank you. I'm so happy. Thank you. Congratulations. Live happily. Together forever. How many times have I seen off the back of someone leaving ''Embracing the lonely darkness of the night, alone again'' I walk, I drift No one to express my love to ''I sleep alone and welcome the morning alone'' Encountering the world ''Still I keep walking. Sometimes remembering.'' Waking up from one dream to another. Until I meet you, shining brightly. I strongly extend my hand To loosen the sorrow Wandering in a past dream ''Still believing Still moving forth alone'' Thank you for coming to see us tonight. ''I'm happy our opening night was a success.'' Thank you to those who came to see us. Let's keep up the good work. Let's make a legend. Cheers! Cheers! Hey, it's Yo! - ''-Good work. - Happy to see you!'' Thanks for coming. How was it? - ''-Good. - Really?'' ''It was, wasn't it? Honestly...'' I think it went great. ''I know it sounds weird for me to say, but we were perfect.'' Talk more later. Is that really all? You looked like you had more to say. It's their first night, so... Imagine I'm Satsuki and try it on me. Then... Tonight's performance was good. But the play itself was a bit off. Honestly, I thought it was a failure. Incorporating dancing is good. ''But although they're part of the play, they didn't seem to fit in.'' The dancing was too beautiful, maybe. I choreographed the dance. Oh, choreographer? And dancer as well. Yes. What's going on? Congratulations! Wait, what? Shit... my bag. Hello! Anyone there? Anyone! What are you doing? It's closing time. Just... Bouldering? I'm sorry for everything. No, it's all fine. You clicked your tongue. What? No, I didn't. I can see it in your eyes. No way. Now that was for real. ''Now that's definitely your tongue clicking.'' Did I click my tongue? Yes, a few times. A habit? - ''-Not at all. - Oh, ok.'' ''What was that? A habit?'' Buy me a beer. Beer? Of course, definitely. - ''-My tongue might stop clicking. - Like hiccups?'' Defeated on opening night. I'm really sorry. On your birthday too, right? But you were honest. Yes. I think you're right. What did I say again? The dancing was too beautiful. ''It was the first time for me to choreograph for a play.'' I wasn't so sure of myself. ''I'm cocky enough to criticize others but I've also been told I'm bad.'' I used to act as well. Really? You don't act now? Nice music. What was that? You're dead if you miss the spots. That's impossible. - ''-Like this? - Yeah, like that.'' - ''-No spot there. - There is.'' You're dead. My name is Teruo Saeki. What's yours? Not gonna tell you. We won't meet again anyway. You were watching us closely. How am I? - ''-Good. - Don't lie.'' What now? - ''-Me, dance? - Please dance.'' Excellent. Ok then, what should I do. Pull. Fly. Fly again. Pull. Do as I do. ''1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And again.'' ''1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Good.'' I'm flying! Wanna fly again? I'm sorry, I lost my way out. Let me show you. Thank you. Have we met before? I have a feeling we have. Yes, a couple of times. All set? July 27 What are you thinking about? Just stuff. ''Done. What do you think?'' I told you the cream comes first. ''The cream, you know, the ones that look like raindrops.'' Yes, but not so big. A bit more pointed like a candle light. Where's the plate? It was here. In the fridge? What do you think? Nice. But... you're so flexible. You think so? He's so cute when he's lost. Here we go. Your mom's delivery day. Thanks so much. Open up wide. Too big!
