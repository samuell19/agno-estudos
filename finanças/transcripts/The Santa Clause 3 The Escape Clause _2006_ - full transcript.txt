SANTA: Ho ho ho. (CHUCKLES) MRS. CLAUS: All right, class, if a reindeer leaves Elfsburg flying west at 20 miles per hour, and another reindeer flies east travelling at 50 miles per hour, how many hours does it take for them to be 210 miles apart? Anyone? Anyone? Trish. How come we can't learn the things we want to? Like what? Like... Wasn't it weird when you married Santa and had to move to the Pole and give up your old life? Weirder than you can possibly imagine. But then something so gigantic happened that it changed Santa and me forever. Like what? Okay. (SCREAMING) Baby Claus is on the way. Ladies, keep up. We need hot water and a lot of ointment. You, think sugar plums. Do not panic! Do not panic! (MRS. CLAUS SCREAMING) Curtis, the baby's coming. The baby's coming. Mrs. Claus, the baby's coming. I know! (ALL SHOUTING) (WHISTLE TWEETING) Deep breaths. Oh, oh, oh! Whoa! That's gonna leave a mark. (PANTING) (SCREAMING) Push. (PANTING) Oh, oh, Scott. Everything's gonna be all right. Where's Dr. Hismus? Oh, oh, Scott. I'm right here, babe. I'm right here. It's all right. Honey, I'm afraid it was a false alarm. (ALL GROANING) Again? GIRL: I stopped a pedicure for this? MRS. CLAUS: ♪ Bells on bobtails ring Making spirits bright ♪ What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight ♪ Oh, jingle bells, jingle... Jingle... ♪ (LAUGHS) Scott! Scott, come here. Come here for a second. Come here. Scott, come here. Come here, come here, come here. Okay. (HUMMING) Ready? Wait for the kick. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way ♪ He's a genius. He? She. She's brilliant like her mother with rhythm like her dad. Yes. But not amazing timing. I wish that the baby had come this afternoon, or last week like we thought. I'm going crazy. I mean, I'm really going crazy. You need a diversion. No, no, Scott. No more gifts. You already gave me a birthstone necklace, oven mitts, the cheese wheel. This is not for you. This is for the baby. I'll be back in a jiff. SANTA: Ho ho! Ho! (LAUGHS) Ho! That never gets old. Okay, now what do we have in the bag for a baby? Well, oddly enough, we have a baby bag. And inside that baby bag, let's see what it is... We have... (EXCLAIMS) Oh, Scott! Oh, honey, it's beautiful! The baby's gonna love it. Yeah. It spins around like this. (KNOCKING) Oh. Later. Come on in. Hey, doc. Dr. Hismus, I'm glad you could come. How are you today, Mrs. Claus? I'm a little concerned because the baby hasn't come yet. No need to worry, Mrs. Claus. Santa! The production line has been set back so far behind we need you on the floor. I can't come down now. It's impossible. Still mapping the sleigh route. Got plenty of work to do up here. Have you even checked this list once? I have perused it. Help me help you. Help me help you. Let's start with your blood pressure, okay? Help me help you help you help you help me help me help you. DR. HISMUS: Don't be nervous. It'll be done before you know it. Help you help me help you... Help me help you. One more thing. The Council of Legendary Figures called a meeting. I can't leave the Pole and go to a council meeting. They know. That's why they came. SANTA: Here? Here. Where? In the kitchen. In the kitchen? Is there an echo in here? Okay, okay. You know what? Sweetheart, I'm feeling much better. I think that I'm going to go on a walk, which is great for the baby. You stay here and have your blood pressure taken, which is great, and I'm gonna go see what's down the hall. (SIGHS) Hi, ladies. Honey? Honey. Carol. Anything I can do for you, ma'am? No, thanks. Care for some company? Not from you, Mr. Claus. Why not? Because you can't spend time with me and get the toys ready. I understand completely. You do? Of course I do. I just hope you're not delivering when I'm delivering. I'm not gonna let that happen. Carol, there's no way I could... Nice chrome work, Lenny. That is so workin'! LENNY: Thanks, Santa. Yeah, baby, yeah. All right. Look, I know this is all a bit overwhelming to you, but... Wait a minute. Stop. Did you see this? Amazing technology. Look at this. It's a duck. It quacks in three languages. El ducko says "quacko." Le duck says "quack." Il duck-e say "quack-e." Things can't help me right now, sweetheart. Hey, come back-e. It's people that I need. You know, family. Ho ho ho! Family? We are your family. Right, elves? We're her family, right? ALL: We love you, Mrs. Claus. Taller family. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Human family. (SOBBING) Oh, sweetheart, anything but the tears. I'm sorry. Thank you. It's okay. (GRUNTS) It's an impossible situation. And if I didn't want to be with you so much, I would go home. But I can't have it both ways. (SIGHING) I guess I just... (SNIFFLING) Wait a minute. Hey. Maybe you can. I can what? Have it both ways. MRS. CLAUS: How? I can bring home here. You can? You can? Carol, I'm gonna bring your parents up here. My parents? Her parents? (ELVES GROANING) Elves! Sir, the SOS. Excuse me? SOS. Secret of Santa. There could be dire consequences. The possibilities increase exponentially that the closely-guarded secret of the North Pole's true location could be compromised and Christmas as we know it would cease to exist, crushing the hopes and dreams of the world's children and extinguishing the joy of Santa's magic forever! There's that. He has a point. My parents can't keep a secret. Listen. Listen, honey, the reason you came up here was because of me. I'm gonna do whatever it takes to make this right. You will? Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I will. You know why? 'Cause what do they say about Santa? ALL: He delivers! Yes! How are you gonna pull it off? My parents think you're a toymaker in Canada. How am I gonna pull this off? (GRUNTING) The answer is in the question. "How are we going to do this? "My dad thinks you're a toymaker in Canada." Canada? Canada. It's north, in North America, eh? Vinegar on their French fries, they sit on their chesterfield to watch the hockey game. Shoot the puck, daddy-o! Come on, everybody! Elves, everybody listen up. Grab your hammers, the in-laws are coming. (STEAM WHISTLE BLOWING) (BELL RINGS) (CHATTERING) TOOTH FAIRY: Hey, Robbie. (CHUCKLES) Virgil, let me see your teeth. That's good. Hiya, elves. ALL: Hi, Tooth Fairy. Open up. Let me see. Aah. Beautiful teeth. (SNORING) MAN: Open the doors if you want to fall in love! Hey, everybody, look, Cupid in the house. Oh, work, work, work. That's nice to see. ALL: Hi, Cupid. What'd I miss? Where's fat boy? (CHUCKLES) Merry Christmas, everybody. Cupid, what's up? Hey, EB. Santa. Molarnator. Sandman. Mother Nature, Father Time. Merry Christmas, again. Good to see everyone. Do you really think it's necessary to call an emergency council meeting? I'm ready to ride the sleigh, know what I mean? Santa, we thought you should see this. Silver bells! I found 270 of them at shopping malls scattered across the Northwest. Ho ho ho! I hereby call this special session of the Council of Legendary Figures to order. This is ridiculous. (SHOUTS) Sandman! I'm up, I'm up! Hey, Cupid, nice skirt. (CHUCKLES) MOTHER NATURE: Easter Bunny. (BANGS GAVEL) Our first and only order of business is the disciplinary action to be taken against council member Jack Frost. Now that's what I'm talking about. (GROANS) You love it. Am I right? You guys finally woke up and are giving me my own holiday. (YAWNS) Frostmas, of course, is just a placeholder. I'm wide open. Frostgiving, the Frost of July. Frosthog Day. The possibilities are endless. Jack, you are hereby charged with 273 counts of attempted upstaging of Santa Claus. You froze a volcano in Hawaii, you made it snow in the Amazon and you frosted Mexico, sending all of the geese north for the winter. You have violated the Legendary Figures code of conduct in a manner that is both willful and malicious. Excuse me. Did you just accuse me of being skilful and delicious? Oh, please. Guilty as charged. You herald the season. You're not a holiday. You're the best friend, you're not the leading man. And you kill fruit. All in favor of suspending Jack Frost from the Legendary Council, please say... Wait a minute! Father Time, wait a minute. You gotta understand, I have enormous untapped potential. But all I am, year after year, is an opening act. A setup man for Mr. Big. Jack, why don't you let that go? No, no, no. The same conversation every year. You get the soda cans and the TV specials. The postage stamps, the billboards, the beautiful adoring wife, and the army of toy-building yes men. What do I get? A few runny noses and some dead citrus. You know, Jack, it's no picnic being me. Because of our production problems a continent might go without toys this year. That's right. On top of that, I've got to protect the Secret of Santa this year (GASPS) because the in-laws... The in-laws... Mr. and Mrs. In Bad Mood Every Time I Turn Around, are coming up to the Pole. They're not supposed to, I gotta come up with a solution. On top of that, I'm a bit worried about being a father again because I wasn't all that good at it the first time. Oh, Santa. We had no idea. Oh, Santa, I'm sorry. If it were me in the red suit, I'd probably go right to the Escape Clause. Oh, no, the Escape Clause. Way too extreme. Really. Escape Clause? What's up with that? Maybe if you'd attend a meeting once in a while you'd know. You manipulate time but you can't grow hair. (EXCLAIM) Legendary? I don't think so. SANTA: I'm not evoking the Clause. I made a commitment. I'll handle the toys, and I'll be there when my wife delivers that baby. Let me help. You've done quite enough. No, no, no. Instead of a suspension, how about community service? Oh, please. What if... What if I... What if I tutor myself at the elbow of the master? I could lend a hand. Make some toys, wrap a few presents. And if I don't make it with the hefty man here, then he says the word and you suspend me. Please, Santa. I know I don't deserve another chance, but I am asking you for one. I want to make things right. All right. You don't want to get suspended? I'll give you one more chance. Have to be a Jack Frost-of-all-trades. Yes. You also have to listen to the elves. Uh-huh. Curtis is your boss. And I mean it. If there's one, one icicle out of place, you are gone. I will not let you down. Motion carried. (HOOF BEATS) SANTA: Ho ho ho! Boys, boys, save it for the stables, will you? (GRUMBLING) Look down there. They got a new roof. Easy, easy! Uncle Scott is here! Lucy! Coat! (GARBLED CHATTERING) (BREAKING WIND) (LAUGHING) Comet! Next time we fly, go easy on the alfalfa, will you? (BREAKS WIND) (LAUGHING) Uncle Scott. Hey, Luce. There we are. There it is. All warm? Just like magic. You have the warmest hug in the world. (COMET GRUMBLING) Hello. Hi, Comet! Hey, son. Hi, Dad. I missed you so much. Hi. A few days early, aren't you? Isn't that baby due any moment? Oh, we got lots to talk about. Hey, Neil. That's a... That's a good-looking sweater vest. It's reversible. Well, of course it is. All right, let's go inside. Lucy, come on. (GRUMBLING) (BREAKS WIND) (LAUGHING) Look at that, it's snowing in Hawaii. Yeah. It's not really magical like the one Charlie has, but I love it. And now I have 12. See? You know, I have quite the snow globe collection myself. How's Danielle doing? Good. Thanks for letting me go snowboarding with her and her parents. You're welcome. Hey, I brought you something. Just a little thing. Oh, boy. What a mess in here. (MURMURING) (RATTLING) (COW MOOING) (SPRINGING) (CARTOONISH SOUND EFFECTS) There we are. (ELEPHANT TRUMPETS) (ROOSTER CROWING) Wedged behind a wheelbarrow. Dad! That's awesome! Thank goodness it wasn't a car. CHARLIE: Thanks. Wow, this is beautiful. Lucy, sweetheart, what are you doing? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. (LUCY GROANING) Come on out. Come here. Come here, come here. Get out of the bag there. Why can't I fit inside? It takes a lot of practice. I wish I could come to the North Pole with you. I could help Carol a lot and she loves me. LAURA: That's true. And hey, maybe I should be the one there for Carol. You know? I mean, another mom. I could... I could help. Hey, maybe... Girls. I've got a full sleigh. You understand my situation. Now, wait a minute, Scott. Let's pause a moment here and take a feelings inventory. (SITAR PLAYING) (BREATHING DEEPLY) Let's look at what you're doing as an uncle from a therapeutic standpoint. Charlie's been to the Pole. Your new baby's being born at the Pole. Lucy's a member of this family too, Scott. And if you harshly exclude her from this formative experience, you could scar her for life. (SITAR PLAYING) And, consequently, her parents, who must accompany her on long-distance journeys. Uh-uh-uh. Please, Uncle Scott. Can I come to the North Pole too? Please? (SIGHS) (EXCLAIMS) Oh, that's awfully good, isn't it? Guys, I've done it. What have you done? Is it going to clean itself up? I don't think so. Quickly, quickly. Curtis, I haven't seen the bearded wonder around for a while. Where'd he go? None of your skis' wax. No need to be nippy. With all the stress I wouldn't blame the big guy for doing that escape hatch thing. Escape Clause. Right. Little elf woman, one cocoa, por favor. GIRL: Right away. Thank you. How does that Escape Clause work, anyway? Sorry, classified. Elfland Security Act. That's just what I'd say. What? If I didn't know anything. Don't be embarrassed. Makes perfect sense. Only the big guy would know the important stuff. For your information, I'm elf number one. (EXCLAIMS) And I know all there is to know about the Hall of Snow Globes. Everybody knows about the Hall of Snow Globes. That's not special. Not special... Not special? It's the most top-secret, hush-hush, amazing place in the world. It's where every Santa throughout history has kept his own personal snow globe. How can you say that that's not special? Because it isn't. Unless you know what it has to do with the Escape Clause, which clearly you don't. I bet Santa doesn't even trust you. Now, you listen here, frostface. Secret Santa snow globe. Santa. I wish that I had never become Santa at all. Whoosh! (MAKING WHOOSHING SOUNDS) Wait, wait, wait, what's this? This is the part where I'm transported through time and everything goes back to the way it was, like I'd never become Santa at all. Ah. Gets the snow globe, puts his hands on it, says the words, and then whoosh! Job opening: Santa Claus. Told you I know everything. Wow. I never dreamed I'd be so well-connected to elves in high places. (CHUCKLES) We really must party in my condo in Gstaad sometime. It'd be fun. Tell me, how do you get into the Hall of Snow Globes, anyway? Sorry, Jack. Now that's classified. I know that, elf number one. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLING) Whoo! Did you bring the deep-dreamin' stuff? Got it. Okay. It's important that they fall asleep and they dream they're on a wonderful flight to Canada. I'm with the program. Good. I may be sleepy, but I'm not stupid. Yeah, well, take the hat off. I get sniffly without my cap. Okay, okay. All right, all right. (CLEARS THROAT) Hey, Dad? Scott Calvin, as I live and breathe. (CHUCKLING) Good thing you called. Otherwise I don't know if I would've remembered you. Well, it's me, good old Scott Calvin. You're looking a little like Father Time. Doesn't look anything like Father Time. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Oh. That's a nice door. Well, thank you. Yeah. It was a little sticky, but smooth as a baby's butt now. Come, take a feel. Oh, why not, huh? Look at that. Very butt-like. Who's your pal? Sandy. This is my associate. He'll be taking us to the airport. An associate? Business must be good. Busy as usual. So busy you can't bring our daughter to visit her mother and father once in a while? Scott. Oh, so nice to see you. You too, Sylvia. And your friend? Sandy. Sandy. Nice to meet you. Do you know how excited we were to get your phone call? See, we get so few, and each one is special. Oh, come on, you guys, you'll catch pneumonia out here. Come on. It's so wonderful to have you all here. Festive. Easy. Please, please sit down. Oh, no, no, no. No. We gotta get to the airport. Kind of a hurry. I suggest we get your bags and pop them in the car. I'm almost packed. Great! Throw my underwear in a bag. It's not like we're going to the North Pole. (BOTH LAUGH NERVOUSLY) It's cold in Canada. Well... Remember when we went to Yosemite? Oh, here we go, Yosemite again. It was freezing and there were bears. How'd you know? You never left the lodge. I didn't leave the lodge because it was freezing. And there were bears? Yes! And it was freezing. BUD: It was freezing weather? SYLVIA: Yes, it was freezing. BUD: Let me see if I understand. You did not enjoy the trip to Yosemite? You heard me. Yeah, I heard you. Poof! (SNORING) What? What part of our plan was not clear? Let's put them to sleep when they get into the car. I just couldn't stand to hear the Yosemite story anymore. Okay. So let's figure how we'll get in the car. We'll both... Sandman, what are you doing? What... Sandman. Sandman! (SNAPPING) (SANDMAN SNORING) Great. Now I get to throw his underwear in a bag. (SNORING) (WHITE CHRISTMAS PLAYING) ♪ I'm dreaming ♪ Of a white Christmas ♪ Just like the ones I used to know ♪ Where the treetops... ♪ Hey, Mrs. C. What you doing? Oh, hi, Jack. I'm trying to pick out a tree the whole family will love. Ah. Family. You know, I cannot imagine how hard it must be keeping such a big secret from your folks. Oh, you have no idea. Tell me, Mrs. Claus, being legendary by marriage, do you ever find yourself wondering if it's all really worth it? Well, it's definitely worth it. I'm sure dropping your old life and schlepping all the way up to the North Pole has been totally worthwhile. Yeah. Probably not one iota, not even a scintilla, of regret? Not one. Yeah. Look at that. Oh, dear. A little sad, neglected maybe. Just needs a little tender loving care that nobody's bothering to give, don't you think? It's perfect. I will give you all the TLC that you need. Scott loves decorating the tree with me. He always insists on putting the tree topper on himself. (SLEIGH BELLS JINGLING) SANTA: Ho ho ho! (GASPS) They're here! (GASPS MOCKINGLY) This is so exciting. (SANTA DRIVES A HOT ROD PLAYING) ♪ Well, Santa's got a hot rod ♪ Santa's got a hot rod ♪ Santa's got a hot rod ♪ Santa's got a hot rod ♪ It's the only way he can rock 'n' roll ♪ That old Christmas sleigh ♪ (CHEERING) ♪ Now, no offence to Rudolph, Donner, Blitzen ♪ You know, and all the rest of those reindeer cats ♪ I'm here!

Not that you're not tall. Surprise! Surprise! Hello! Oh, you look wonderful. Really? You are glowing. What did you think of my parents? They slept the entire trip. This is amazing! Can we see the workshop? Yes. Go right there. Go ahead. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait! You know that my mom and dad can't know we're at Santa's workshop in the North Pole? Where do they think we are? Welcome to Canada! Eh? That was an easy flight. We cruised right through customs. Oh, what a strange flight. SYLVIA: Mmm. Go, go, go. It was like a dream. And such a nice meal. They gave you a meal? I got four nuts in a pouch. And you had us sit in coach. No, that was first class. And I got a chance to sit next to Tony Bennett. Mom! Dad! Sweetheart! Sweetheart. Come here. Oh, you... Oh! Look at you, look at you. And look at this, look at this. It could be twins. But since you married the toymaker, we don't get a lot of information. Oh, honey, just stop it, okay? Sweetheart, I am just so happy to see you, darling. I'm so happy to see you too, Mom. And I'm sure you have a perfectly good reason for shutting us out of your life. LAURA: Magnificent. It's amazing. LUCY: Killer. Now, please remember, you're welcome to observe, but don't touch anything or interfere with the toy making process. I'll make sure she doesn't get into anything. Look! Kobi the Magic Panda and accessories! Lucy! Lucy, come back here. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) Whoa! Trains. I'm... I'm just gonna go make a doll! Oh, excellent job. Bang, bang! (CHUCKLES) (GROWLING) (CHUCKLES) Isn't that fun? Faster, worker elves, faster. The Hall of Snow Globes, perhaps? Hmm. What might we have here? It's a lot of beans. How many beans can he eat? JACK: Whoo! Who are you? Who are you? You don't particularly resemble one of the red man's minions. What's the deal? I'm Lucy. Scott's my uncle. Oh! I'm Frost. Jack Frost. Who? Jack Frost. You know, the Jack Frost? Never heard of you. Jack Frost. Legendary figure. Ring a bell? No. But I know about Tooth Fairy and Sandman and the Easter Bunny. You got to know about me. I'm a legendary figure, too, with enormous power in my own right. Okay, okay, chill. I invented chill! Sorry. Hey, how would you like to be one of my elves? Uh... No. Hey, Mom? (MOCKING) No. SYLVIA: What a quaint little village. Everybody's just so petite. No. Tom Cruise is petite. These people are short. What's the deal with them? Who? What? Oh, uh... Have you ever been to Canada? No. It's too far. We did go to Rochester, New York, once, though, to visit her sister. Very lovely place. But it's not Canada, is it? No. SANTA: Well, this is... This is what Canadians look like. Ah. And stretch. (SITAR PLAYING) NEIL: Stretch. Let all those packages go. Know that you're enough. And breathe. (INHALING DEEPLY) (EXHALING) Very good. Now don't forget you can do this on your own whenever you get stressed out. I won't always be here to help you. Stress can reduce your life by hundreds of years. Hundreds. BUD: You take Christmas very seriously. The most wonderful time of year. (SCOFFS) Yeah! Oh, honey, just because you're not into Christmas doesn't mean others can't enjoy it. The kids are not gonna enjoy their toys this year. This stuff should've been in stores weeks ago. No worries. We have a unique distribution system up here. Well, in order to distribute this stuff you're gonna have to freeze time. (CHUCKLES) Trust me, sir. Manipulating the space-time continuum (WHISTLING SOFTLY) for one-night global delivery is the easy part. Who are you? Curtis. Eh? Who's hungry? Hey, guys, how you doing? Listen, come here. Got some exciting news. Will put a little spring into your elfin step. Santa says he really wants you to take a break. So there's a delicious vat of steaming hot cocoa in the lounge with your little names on it. (MUFFLED CHUCKLING) Mmm. Oh, it's a tantalizing blend of full, rich cocoa with just a suggestion of vanilla. (CHUCKLING) Get in there and try some, won't you? It's got your names on it. Enjoy. (CHUCKLING) (MACHINE WHIRRING) (MACHINE ACCELERATING) (HUMMING) A sumptuous blend of Gold Coast and Spanish cocoas. Sweet to the palate, but, oh, so warm to the tummy. With a trickle of cinnamon and orange essence, enough to drive the taste buds mad! Go on. (ICE CRACKLING) SYLVIA: Look at this kitchen! (EXCLAIMS) Look at the size of that oven. You could cook a woolly mammoth in there. Let's have something to eat. You got some operation. You've been holding out. Why the secrecy? There's no secrets. I don't have secrets. Why? We're family. Heaven's sakes, you must be the in-laws. So very pleased to meet you. Hi. Bud, Sylvia, this is... Jack Frost. No, not Jack Frost. He's playing Jack Frost in our "Yippee, it's Canada!" parade. Oh, yes, of course. To bring frosty cheer to the workers. I'm kind of like the team mascot, eh? Rah rah! Who does your hair? You like it? It's... I freeze-dry it. (BUZZING) Sir, can I borrow you? Yeah. Excuse me just a minute. (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) We have a small paperwork problem. You go right ahead. I'll make sure everyone's as happy as a lark. For that's why I'm here, eh? Cocoacchinos, anyone? What's going on? What's going on? I don't know, sir. We're still trying to assess here! Uh... GIRL: Somebody get me out of here. We've got a cascade failure in the motherboard. You gotta get a rerouter. You need a solder gun and a... I can't see! I can't see! You need some scissors. (POWERING OFF) I'm off to help electrics. (GASPING) (HUMMING) (SNIFFS) Ah. (ICE CRACKLING) Kitchen this size, I can't find a sandwich. Oh. Oh, let me help you there. Oh, for heaven... How does something like that happen? Oh, dear. Cocoacchinos, anyone? Oh. Yes. Thank you. Oh, you're welcome. Let me get you this chair here. There we go. Isn't that lovely? (BUZZING) And here you go. I hope you like it. Oh, my. It's my own recipe. Yes. SYLVIA: Mmm. Minty. Doesn't it make you feel fresh? Oh, yes, it does. Oh, my, I just... I love your hair. You do? Yeah, I do. I love yours. Really? I've never seen anything like that. Oh, you're so adorable. You divine little kitten, you. (GROWLS) And I bet you sing, too. No, no, no, no. No. Go on. I bet you can sing. Maybe a little bit. I knew it, I knew it. Sing something. What would you like to hear? How about... ♪ Chestnuts roasting on an open fire ♪ Jack Frost nipping at your nose ♪ (SHIVERING) Oh, I love it. ♪ Yuletide carols being sung... ♪ No, no, go back to the other line, the part before... ♪ Jack Frost nipping at your nose ♪ Gives me chills. (LAUGHING) ♪ Jack Frost nipping at your nose ♪ Oh, what a lyric. What's going on over here? Your mother is fabulous! (BOTH LAUGHING) Would you like to be my elf? Huh? You heard me. BUD: Heads up! Heads up! Coming through! Fire! Fire! Back off! Back off! Back off! We got a dangerous situation. Back off! Back off! Don't breathe. Don't breathe in. What's wrong with you people? We were an inch away from Armageddon. I'll get a mop. Oh, Dad, you did great. Are you all right? Had to be done. That was wonderful, honey. Hi, everyone. Hey! Oh, my! You're awake! Awake, yeah. Who are you? Mom and Dad, this is Scott's ex-wife, Laura, and her husband, Neil. Hi. Their daughter, Lucy. Hi. They came to join us for Christmas. Isn't that nice? If Scott is that close to his ex-wife, and you don't find that incredibly threatening, I'm sure it's very nice. SANTA: Hi, everybody, I'm back. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened? Nothing, except you didn't tell your in-laws your ex-wife is spending Christmas with you. More secrets. (SCREAMING) (STEAM HISSING) Nothing works in this joint. If you think this is something, you should see the delivery room. Is there a problem? I want to see the delivery room. What? Heavy load! Coming through! Watch your backs, people. Watch your backs. Set it down there. This is the delivery room? This is not a delivery room. This is a disaster area. What's going on here? SANTA: We're remodeling. It's gonna be big, comfortable. This is a broom closet. How come the oven in the kitchen's bigger? This isn't a broom closet... Watch your back again! (CRASHING) There we go. This is the hospital for the entire toy factory. How about that, Syl? Our grandchild is being born in a broom closet of a Canadian toy factory. Sweetheart, you can be honest with us. Don't be afraid. Are you being held here against your will? Is there even a doctor here? Yes, there's a doctor... Hello! I'm Dr. Hismus. Pleasure to meet you, eh? SYLVIA: This is the doctor? Very good doctor. I see. ELF: Watch your backs. Excuse me. We got... What are we supposed to do with the wood in here? Why do we have wood in here now? I'm taking over. No, no, don't be silly. Just let the tiny Canadians do it. Somebody get me an apron and a hammer. Apron and hammer! (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) SYLVIA: What's happening? CURTIS: Emergency in the toy factory! SANTA: Back in two minutes. Okay, let's go to work. GIRL: I got this one. (COIL SPRINGING) There it is! I got it! Look out, coming through. I got it, I got it. Go. Boy, these bears. We gotta make them stop. It's a great way to put out an eye. Shut this thing down! Hey, cut it off, cut it off. Right there's the start. Cut it off. Oh! (ALL EXCLAIMING) Where are the fire elves? (BELL CLANGING) Help. Give me an aisle. Come on. Let the professionals at it. Stay low, hit the base of the flame. Sir, sir! Curtis, Curtis, stop. If you're gonna tell me our entire facility is in ruin, Christmas is tomorrow, and for the first time in history all the kids of the world won't get what they asked for because I failed, stop it. I can't stand one more piece of bad news. Well, then, good news, sir. What? Your pants are on fire. SANTA: Fire in the hole! Captain. I'm on it, Curtis. Whoa. (SIGHING) Oh, my. Is there anything I can do? Why don't you put a chill on my bottom for me? Go to the naughty and nice area and help the elves clean up. Go! Move, move, move! Quickly, move it! Out of our way! Stop lollygagging! Need a status report. Springs on the pogo sticks melted. Let me see, let me see. I like that toy. Glenda. Give me a status report. Legs on the ironing board burned up. Let me see. Only the wheels are left on the wooden trucks, sir. That was my favorite. The rockets are in pieces, but the launch motors are intact, sir. Launch motors intact? Get over here. I think I got an idea. (DRILLING) (BUZZING) (SAWING) (AIR GUN WHIRRING) (BELL DINGS) Jet-powered scooter board. (CHEERING) BOY: Way to go, Santa! Yay. That's how the men in red get things done. We got a schedule to keep. Let's get back to work. (MUMBLING INSTRUCTIONS) Let's go, let's go, let's go! Whoa. You're just amazing. (CHUCKLES) Can't keep a good Santa down, huh? So, doesn't anything bother you? You don't sweat the small stuff, Jack. Problem at work, that's a challenge. Problem at home, that's a problem. Uncle Scott, Uncle Scott, that was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Wait a minute. You weren't worried, were you? Not for a second. Neither was I. Uncle Scott, you know what I've been dying to see? No. Your snow globe collection. All right, you can see it, if you can catch me. Watch out, coming through. Last one up is a glazed ham! Okay, now don't watch what I'm doing, 'cause this is a very secret code. Oh, come on, Uncle Scott. It is. (CRANKING) Very secret. Watch what happens. Whoo! Look out, look out! (BOTH CHUCKLE) Whoa. LUCY: Where are we? Well, I think I told you I have a pretty amazing collection of snow globes. This is the Hall of Snow Globes. Go on in. (CHUCKLES) This is so beautiful, Uncle Scott. These are all the snow globes for all the Santas that have ever been. And this one... That one's mine. It's my very favorite, just like you gave Charlie. Yeah. You know, I'm kind of partial to this one myself. Look, it's snowin'. Yeah. You got a good collection. Too bad you don't have one like this. (GASPS) It's... It's me. Yeah. Hugging a snowman. Oh! And he turns pink! I told you your warm hugs were magical. Thank you for my present, Santa. Oh, it's okay. Well, look at it this way. One down, 2.6 billion to go. We better get out of here. Hold on, here we go.

Good news is I get to spend time with you guys. Scott. Sir. Sorry to interrupt. There's something you need to check twice. (STAMMERING) Two minutes? What? What? (MURMURING INDISTINCTLY) SANTA: We have a problem. This is unreadable. Unreadable because it's crinkled up. You gotta flatten it out. It's gotta be in my office. Yeah, my office. Neil? What? Let's find Lucy, get her washed up for dinner. Leave that here. Leave it. We'll be right back. (SIGHS) Don't worry, honey. That's not gonna work. It's busy season. It's always his busy season. That's Uncle Scott's snow globe. You're not supposed to have that. I know. Isn't it great? It's not great at all. You've done a terrible thing. You'll be on the naughty list the rest of your life. But naughty list people have more fun. I'm going for help. I wouldn't do that. Mom, Dad! Over here, quick! Lucy! What? Come on, hurry! NEIL: What's wrong? What's wrong? LAURA: Sweetheart, what is it? Huh? I told you not to do that. Jack Frost took Uncle Scott's snow globe and he knows that it's not his. (LUCY SCREAMS) (ICE CRACKLING) Stop! Stop! Don't! What did you do? I froze them. (BREATHES DEEPLY) Now, am I gonna have to do the same thing to you? Or are you going to get into that closet and stay there without saying a word? Smart girl. Oh, smile, will you? I've had kids beg me to freeze their parents. And to think I asked you to be my elf. Yes, of course all those bears are machine-washable. Right. Just put it on the card. Look, I can't be in two places at once. You've gotta manage and stop calling me every time something goes wrong. I'm a little busy with my family up here, Curtis. All I want to see is busy, busy worker tushies. Hey, hey, hey, I'm rolling downhill. This is not up to code, this building. SANTA: You're number one. Act like it. Why haven't you put the tree topper on the tree? Oh, Scott's just been a little busy. Tell your dad to do it. And then watch the suddenly displaced Mr. Claus run right over. Go ahead. It'll be fun. Hey, Dad, do you want to help me with the tree topper? Yeah, in a minute. (GRUNTS) I don't know who he is anymore. I don't know who he is anymore either. Neil, Lucy and Laura should be here for this. They left a while ago. I wonder where they are. Some of the Canadians invited them over for cocoa. You know how they are. Yak-yak, yak-yak, eh? Scott? Tree topper, what do you say? Scott, honey, let's put the tree topper on. We can make a toast. BUD: Hey, hey! You built this on a fault line. Millions of kids in Australia will go without gifts. What can I do? MRS. CLAUS: Tree topper. Oh, yeah, tree topper. Good. Scott? Toast. (RINGTONE PLAYS WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS) Just a second. Uh-huh. Good. Bad. Well, good for goodness sakes. Yeah. Curtis, I can't talk right now, I'm putting the tree topper on the tree. It's very important. Can't talk. Please, please, please, I gotta go. Bye. (RINGTONE PLAYS WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS) Gonna put it in my pocket. I'm not answering that. I'm putting the phone in my pocket. Put it in my pocket. All done. Okay, everybody, as I climb up this beautiful tree, I know we've had our ups and downs. But as I place this tree topper in the traditional place, I just want to say... (SCREAMING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (EXCLAIMS) SANTA: Be careful, honey. (CRYING) Oh, honey. Honey, I think maybe I can fix that. I know you're upset. You picked up on that, did you? Bud, what is that supposed to mean? Maybe if you weren't working all the time you might know. Maybe you don't understand the pressure I'm under. Well, maybe it's not as bad as being ripped away from your family and told you can't see them anymore. MRS. CLAUS: Dad. I invited you so Carol can be surrounded by family for love and support, while I try to do things you can't even imagine. Rather than try to make things work, you're trying to make things worse. We're leaving. What? Maybe we shouldn't have come. Maybe you're right. Maybe you shouldn't have come. Maybe I should never have come either. Don't say anything you'll regret. I think we all need to cool down for a second. Why don't you and I take a walk? Come on. Let's go. Let's just go. Oh, sweetheart. It's over. I thought I had a second chance at having a family, but I blew it again. Hey. There's no one I know who could hold this all together but you. But I didn't. My in-laws resent me, Christmas is a disaster, and my pregnant wife wishes that she never had met me. You know, I was gonna wait until tomorrow to give you this, but I think you need a bit of a pick-me-up now. I can't. Come on. Open it. I don't feel like it. Go ahead, it'll make you feel better. I don't feel like it. Come on, open it, please. Thanks. So are there times when you wonder... Wonder what? If this was even... Worth it? (SCOFFS) More than you know. Tonight's one of these times, huh? Wish I'd never put that red coat on. So you wish you'd never become Santa at all? (SCOFFS) I wish I'd never become Santa. At all? At all. At all. Yeah, at all. I wished I'd never been Santa at all. Happy? I am now. No! (JACK CACKLING) (SCREAMING) (GROANING) Ho ho ho! Hey, you! Ho ho... Uh-oh! (GRUNTS) Get off me, blubber ball! I will not let you put on that coat! Oh, yeah? Watch me! Don't even think about it, Jack. (LAUGHS TRIUMPHANTLY) You hit me with a shovel! (GASPS) JACK: Adios, fatty! No, Frost, no! Oh, no. Okay, so, the Mississippi factory needs to know if we want them to ship 100,000 units or 200,000. They won't ship tomorrow because it's Christmas, but they will ship Thursday, which means... They're not gonna ship tomorrow because it's Christmas? Yes, sir. This is Christmas Eve? Yes, sir. What are you doing here? Why are we working? We always work Christmas Eve. We do? Of course. Well, that... That's ridiculous. Christmas Eve is when you spend time with your family. Where's my family tonight? I really don't know, Mr. Calvin. What do you mean? Well, you rarely see them and you don't mention them. Where are my car keys? (DOORBELL RINGING) Hey. What are you doing here? Well, I just came over to see... See what? Why on earth would you drag yourself all the way over here? CHARLIE: Is that Derek? No. You're not going out tonight. Yeah, okay. What is he doing here? Came over to see you. Why? 'Cause we don't see each other enough. (HORN BEEPING) What? BOY: Come on, Charlie. I'm out of here. Oh, come on, Charlie, it's Christmas Eve. Like either of us care, Mom? Charlie. CHARLIE: What? Come back here. Charlie! Good night, Scott. Wait, wait! Can you help me find Carol? Carol? Carol Newman. Carol Newman, the principal of Charlie's school? Yeah. Do you know where she is? I don't know. She moved away. Ran out of local kids to terrify, I guess. I don't know. What is the matter with you? Neil. Neil and Lucy, they'll understand. Where are they? At the North Pole. At the North Pole? Yeah. The North Pole. Frost. What? Frost turned the North Pole into a theme park. Neil has been taking Lucy to the North Pole ever since he and I got our divorce, remember? Divorce? Are you sure you should be driving? I'm gonna make everything okay. I'm gonna make everything better. Yeah. Okay.

What happened between you and Laura? I know you think therapy is like witchcraft, but you of all people might consider it. Please, please, just tell me. Maybe you don't really know because you were never around. It shouldn't be any news to you, Scott. You were never a father to Charlie. You put all the pressure on me, and guess what? He didn't want me to be his father, which messed things up pretty good between me and Laura. Want me to go on, Scott? Come on, Dad, the line's getting longer. (SIGHS) CURTIS: Excuse me, sir. Curtis. Yes, sir. Can I offer you tickets for a turn to build a toy with Santa's elves? I'll throw in this year's commemorative pen, voice-enhanced. Will that be cash or credit card?

Oh, for the love of candy canes, what have you done here? Well, sir, this is a nice list kiosk. The line ends there by the reindeer petting zoo.

Easy does it, Armani man. No hello? Love what you've done with the place? JACK ON PA: Shave a reindeer for five dollars. Hey. Frost, Frost, what about the secret of Santa? How could you do this to the North Pole? The whole thing is way too much work, way too much pressure. Besides, no one even thanks you for the effort. What do you mean no thank yous? What about the plates of cookies and milk? Please, I'm cleansing. So I stopped the whole toy delivery nonsense, and I brought anyone who could afford to pay up here. Who needs magic? Who needs to be crawling on roofs and chimneys? (BREATHES DEEPLY) I got everything I need right here. Look around. This isn't how the North Pole's supposed to be. You know this is wrong. Why don't you chill out and enjoy the swag, huh? This junk is not what Christmas is about. You're the one who gave it all up. Because you tricked me. Tricked you? Give me a break. I didn't know you had my snow globe. Maybe not, but who said, "I wish I'd never been Santa at all"? What? I said, "Who said, 'I wish I'd never been Santa at all'?" Rudolph? Rudolph's mama?

I want the coat! Why? 'Cause you make such a good Santa? Because all the elves love you? All those people you took money from, they love you? Listen to me, listen to me.

Well, that didn't work out the way I'd hoped. Carol. (CHUCKLING) Oh, Scott. We've been looking everywhere for you. Come here. Oh, Mrs. Claus, I've missed you. I missed you so much, so much. Wait, it's just been a few minutes. It's only been a few minutes? Yes. Of course. It only takes a few minutes to see the truth of an entire lifetime. I don't understand. A man goes out into the world, and expects his dreams to come true, and then, the unexpected happens. Pick up a red coat and become Santa Claus. That's huge! And it's a lot of pressure. Taking care of all the children of the world, and the elves and the SOS and the North Pole, but he loses sight of what's really important: A woman who falls in love with him and gives him a baby. I love being Santa Claus and I love you. I love you too. Have you been drinking cocoa? No. I'm back. I've missed you very, very much. I missed you too. (BOTH LAUGHING) Ohhh! Hey, you guys know what happened? No. We ticked each other off. That's it. Just like families all over the world are doing on Christmas Eve that love each other: Ticking each other off. We don't have to be perfect to be good families. We just have to be together. I'm still so very sorry that we just added to all this pressure that you're under. And I think that we should apologize. Don't you, honey? No. It's good I'm tough on him. I'm his father-in-law. It's my job. As long as you promise to do it every Christmas, it's fine with me. We'll see about that. I'm a very busy guy. And so am I. And I'd like to show you guys what I do. No, Scott, the SOS. The SOS is about secrets, and secrets aren't for families. I'm tired of keeping you from your family. So if you guys would follow me to my factory. SANTA: Elves? (CLEARS THROAT) Elves! Stop working for a minute. I'd like you all to say hello to the in-laws. ALL: Hello, in-laws! Hello. How ya doing? Elves. Oh, my. BUD: They're not Canadians. They're elves. Never said, like, in person... Listen, if they're elves, this is not a toy factory. This is... This is probably Santa's workshop. And if this is probably... If this is Santa's workshop, then... He... Then he's the guy. Hey, you... You the guy. You're Father Christmas. It's a little freaky, but you'll get used to it. Whoa! Wow! If you're Father Christmas that means I'm Father Christmas' father-in-law. That means I'm... I'm Father-in-law Christmas. And I'm Mother-in-law Christmas. (BUD EXCLAIMING) Hi, Santa! Hi, Bud! Sylvia.

Checked with Curtis and found out you were behind, so I decided to call professionals. LUCY: Uncle Scott! Lucy, what's happened? I found her locked in a closet. What's wrong? You've got to see what Frost did to my mom and dad. (ELVES MURMURING) It's gonna be okay. Ow. Yeah, and? Elficers, I have him. Jack, this isn't funny. Unfreeze the parents right now. No way, Claus. I can't unfreeze them without unfreezing myself, and that is something I'll never do. Mother Nature, help me out here. Can you thaw him out? I'm sorry, Santa. Our powers don't work on other legendary figures. Isn't that a shame? (CHUCKLES EVILLY) What do you say, Luce? Do you think it'll work? The question is, do you? (CHUCKLES) Okay. This is what you're all reduced to? Sending a little girl in to save the day, are we? What you gonna do, adorablize me? Sweet me into submission? Cute me to death? Make me change my way! Hey.
