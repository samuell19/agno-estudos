How lovely is a sunny day The air is serene after a storm The air is fresh And it looks like a celebration How lovely is a sunny day? But another sun Which is more beautiful, my dear My sun Is in front of you The sun, my sun Is in front of you It is in front of you When evening comes And the sun goes down I become melancholy I could stay under your window Until evening comes And the sun goes down But another sun Which is more beautiful, my dear My sun Is in front of you The sun, my sun Is in front of you It is in front of you Bravo, Andrea! Goodbye. Thank you! If you sing another song, we'll take you home tonight too. - Okay. Goodbye. - Andrea! This is yours. - It is why I came to Naples. - What's this? - See you this evening. - Don't be late. We're leaving at five. All right. Hey, take it easy! We are all protesting. As women, we're protesting too. In a few days, high school will be over. - You're counting the days? - Yes. - University will be easy. - I'll start protesting. - We'll all protest. - We women will protest too. - Against what? - We don't know yet. - We'll know when we get there. - "When we get there." We've come to the end of high school finals. I get a fever thinking of them. - You'll definitely pass! - You have an eight average. - I have a four average! - Don't be so upset! Will you have a party for your 18th birthday? Almost definitely. I'll let you know. I must go to the seamstress. It's late. Goodbye. - Bye. - I must get those clothes. I'm sorry. Is there anything fragile in there? Nothing important. - I'm sorry. - It can happen. 1.8 million liras. - To who? - Antonio Belmonte. "Antonio Belmonte". Don Antonio, do you guarantee that it's all authentic stuff? Please, I am an antique dealer! - I started from scratch. - You dealt with used stuff? I was a secondhand dealer. - Remember, at three. - Don't worry. The things will be in your home at three. - Here's the check. - Thanks. - You made a great deal. - You too. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Hi, Dad. - Rosetta! What were you up to? Where were you? I was worried. Why are you late? - Sorry. I went to the seamstress. - Don't apologize, my child. But when you go out with this steel boulder, I worry. Understand? It’s just a scooter, Dad. I know, but I am afraid of car drivers. They drive like madmen! If everyone did as I do, there wouldn't be accidents. I walk or use a wheelchair. Yes, but if I pass my finals, you'll buy me a 500. I'll buy everything! A 500, a 1100, a 1500! Close up and let's go eat. I can't. I'm waiting for those two slowpokes. They have a delivery at three. - Don't get angry. You know them. - I know them well. Enough. One of these days I'll fire them! My company has a reputation. I need dynamic young people! You've said that for ten years. I know you. - This time I will do it! - I am going upstairs. Rosetta, please, tell that sort of maid that when I go up, I want to eat. I've an important appointment at three. All right, Dad. Calm down. - Good day. - Good day. May I help you? - What is it? - A jade statue. - Jade? - It's new, not antique. I bought it in Hong Kong. I did my military service in the Navy. I'm from Capri and I'm a boatman. While touring the world, I always bought something of value. It's mine, I swear. I'm selling it. It isn't high season and I earn little with the boat. - It's a shame. - I know, but I need the money. No. It's a shame that an arm is missing. - It broke even though it was in cotton? - Did it break by itself? A girl bumped into me and it fell. It can happen. If you need money, I'll buy it even with a broken arm. But it loses value. I'll buy the stone. - I can give you 10,000 liras. - Okay. I paid 7,000 for it. 7,000 liras for a jewel like this? But I went to Hong Kong on State expenses. - If you go, it'll cost you more. - I hadn't thought of that. If you've other things that aren't mutilated, bring them. I pay well. Thank you, but I hope to keep them. - This is valuable, rare. - No, it's a Fratino. - It's rare because the legs are curved. - Yes, that's true. They are curved. You're more an antique dealer than I am. No, I'm a boatman but I like lovely things and I study them. - Go to an expert if you don't believe me. - It could be. A noble woman sold it to me. - Good day and thank you. - Thank you and goodbye. I hope to come to Capri, and see you. I want to see your objects. Okay. If you don't find me at the port, ask for Andrea the Canary. - Everyone knows me. - Andrea the Canary. - I’ll come to see you. Goodbye. - Goodbye and thanks again. - Dad, it's ready. - Good. Start eating. - Dad, not for me, but for Carmela. - I can't move. I must wait for those two. - Here we are! - You came. Aren't there policeman around Naples? - Why? - You weren't arrested! You left this morning on an errand and have come back at this hour. - In town… in town. - There was a long line. - From the wicket to the do… - Where did you go? No, from the wicket to the door of Town Hall. Okay, let's say that this morning all of Naples was at Town Hall! Did you bring the certificate? - What… - Be quiet, don't talk! Let him talk. You are only useful for writing. Go on, speak up. - You want to talk? - I'll talk. Will you talk? - He'll talk. - We'll talk. - You'll talk? - They will talk! - You must talk, idiot! - Me? I'll talk, but I don't know what that certificate is. How can I say this? I am missing my great, great grandfather's certificate to prove my princely heritage! - I am from Belmonte… - You're not from Naples? I am more Neapolitan than you are, imbecile! It says "Belmonte" at the registry office. The "di" is missing. Idiot. What did you understand? I am missing the noble "di." It is on my great, great grandfather's certificate. Did you find it? The... the... Forget about the certificate. I'll take care of it. You worry about taking the furniture to the engineer before three. - Yes, sir! - Darn it! I'm going to eat. Tell me when you finish loading. - Eat in… don't worry. - It's unbelievable! I couldn't stand it anymore! I was so hungry. Wait! I haven't finished. When you arrive late, you must eat in a hurry. I arrive when I feel like it, and eat when I feel like it! I am the landlord and you are the maid. No. You are my employer and I am the home employee. All right, home employee, let me eat the pasta. - I have to leave at three. - I am leaving at three too. - I will fire her! - Who will you hire? She's been with us since Mom was here. - You're right. - She is honest and trustworthy. Eat, or she'll even take the meat away. - Dad, what did that boy want? - What boy? - He was with you earlier. - He came to sell a lovely jade statue. He bought it in Hong Kong when he was a sailor. It had a broken arm. Someone made him drop the package. I gave him 10,000 liras. How much would you have given him if it wasn't broken? 60,000 liras. The jade stone is worth a lot. I'll break the other arm off so it'll become rare, like the Venus de Milo, and sell it for double. What if that poor boy needed money? Those who sell always need money. But what can I do? I am a businessman. - Excuse me. - Come in. - My arm! - Stay by my side, always. What happened? What do you want? - Good day. - Good day. - We loaded the truck. - Good. After the delivery, open the shop. As… As? You want an aspirin? Do you have a headache? No, I meant… - As you wish. - What? - We'll open the shop. - All right, hurry. - Go deliver the stuff. - Okay, but there's no hurry. Eat your fruit calmly. Don't worry. We'll smoke a cigarette and then we'll look at you. I want to see you when you eat the fruit! Idiot! This isn't a show! Go deliver. It's already 20 to three. I will eat the fruit, but not in your presence. Okay, as you wish. Let's go. Get the table, hurry. Don't spill any salt, it's bad luck. Stop! Are you in cahoots with Carmela to make me starve? No, we're not in cahoots with Carmela. - We are not… - I already said it. - He said it. - Put the table here. The table is on the engineer's list. Yes, you are right. I had forgotten. Well, I managed to stick to my diet today. Let's go. Get some water, quick. - Be careful, damn! - It wasn't me! I didn't eat anything. I didn't touch the spaghetti. I couldn't taste the meat. I just hope to eat this apple. Aren't you glad? You'll stay thin and learn not to sell the house furniture. No. I'm afraid can't do that. It's an old antique dealer's tactic. When someone doesn't decide to buy, I bring him here. I tell him that I am depriving myself of a personal object. - And have him pay a lot for it. - Hurry. It's almost three. It's three! The appointment! Dad, may I invite my friends for my birthday? Invite whoever you want. You're the mistress of the house. - Good day. - Good day, Mr. Belmonte. - You are 12 minutes late. - I'll apologize to the countess. - Announce me. - I can't. - Did the deadline expire? - Deadlines never expire with you. If the countess is resting, I'll return tomorrow. Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today. The countess never rests. She is with her attorney. - Would you like to sit down? - Yes. Please. Countess, say yes and I will cancel the mortgage on the building, on the villa in Capri and the Pomigliano d'Arco lands. - Are you listing my financial problems? - No. It was to say how much I love you. - Will you say yes? - No, I can't. You are a professional, a rich man, but you don't have a noble social level. Say yes! I can't. When my husband, the count, was dying, he said, "Rosa, I leave you a young, rich and attractive woman." "Enjoy, and have fun! Don't think of me from November 2nd!" "Marry again if you want, but make it a noble." "If you deny your social class, I will appear every night at just the right moment." Do you want a "ménage a trois" with the deceased? - I don't believe in ghosts. - But I believe my deceased husband. Every time I think about marrying a plebeian, my feet itch at night. That's a circulation problem. I have that too. So my husband suspects, he scratches your feet too. Countess, I can't stand it anymore. I gave you proof of my love! If you refuse to marry me, I will take everything away! - Do you want to marry me? - No. Kiss my hand and leave. - We'll discuss it in 15 days. - Thank you, thank you. Thank you for granting me this hope. - Goodbye. - What a clumsy man! Poor attorney! - Countess. - What is it, Francesco? - Mr. Belmonte is waiting to be received. - Yes, I invited him. Mr. Belmonte, come, please. - May I? - Come in. Sorry, I'm late, but there are so many cars and motorbikes, cabs, airplanes… I meant pedestrians. - Chaotic traffic. - Please, Belmonte, sit down. To what do I owe the honor of your invitation? - I am hanging onto your every word. - I wanted to ask you about a Caffè. I'll gladly accept. I didn't have one at home. - What? - Coffee. Nino! Nino, Nino! - You're using my nickname! - What am I doing? - My name is Antonio. You called me Nino! - Mr. Belmonte, don't start this again. You are a handsome man, and rich, maybe very rich. Women like you, but there is an irremovable obstacle between us. Countess, I am of noble blood. My linage goes way back. I am looking for my great, great grandfather's certificate. - Find it and we'll talk about it. - Then why did you call me Nino? I mean the painter Nino Caffè. - Nino Caffè. - Excuse me. I wanted you to see his painting. I've little money left. My son bought a Ferrari. The young count. I haven't met him yet. Thank God. He is crazy. - Crazy is just a way of saying-- - No, he really is. He is a duke, isn't he? An authentic duke, one of the oldest Neapolitan noble families. He's the 13th Pippo della Corte. With him, your deceased husband would not appear. - No, because he is noble. - Right. Good day, Count. The Mercedes is ready. Francesco, I told you I am going out with the new Ferrari. Excuse me. You are becoming senile. - You like this Caffè? - Let me taste it! Yes. The breadth is there. Those are the shadows. - Is it really a Caffè? - Nothing is fake in this house! - Excuse me. - Every painting is authentic. That's what worries me. I'll take it with my eyes closed for you. - Three million. - Three million with your eyes closed? I paid five million with open eyes. Maybe I am not expert on Caffè. You decide the amount, Donna Rosa. - Call me Countess. - I'm sorry, Countess. I'll think about it for a few days. Will you take it? I will take your Caffè. - I'll call you soon. - Yes, hurry, Donna Rosa! Countess, don't forget it. Forgive me. I didn't want to disrespect you. I heard other nobles use their names. Don Alfonso, Donna Matilde. Donna Leonora… Yes, amongst nobles, between high-class people, understand? Yes, Countess. - Did you call me? - Yes. Accompany the gentleman. My respects, Countess. Please. What do I do to men? Do you know where Andrea the Canary lives? - I know. - Thank you. - Do you know him? - Yes, he's my brother. - What is your name? - Pietro Canarino. - Is it a family nickname? - No. It's my brother's name and mine. We have a golden uvula. His is more golden than mine. - Does he sing well? - Yes. Miss, have you ever heard of Tamagno, Caruso and Del Monaco? - Yes. - Andrea is more talented than them. - Will you call Andrea? - He's not here. - You should've told me that first. - You just asked me now. You foreigners can't explain yourselves well. You're right. Let me talk to your mother. All right, but you can talk to me, because when Andrea isn't here, I am the head of the family. Mom, someone wants you! Who is it? - Good day. - Good day, Miss. You want to talk to me? Yes, this morning your son sold a little statue. - Was it a fake? - No. - Not at all. - Thank goodness! Andrea is a good boy. He supports the whole family. The antique dealer didn't give him enough because it was broken. Why is that? I had padded it with cotton, wrapped and tied it. I'm sorry, it was my fault. I bumped into him and the statue fell. Give this to your son, please. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - I didn't understand a thing. - Look what is in the envelope. Ten, 20, 30, 40, 50! 50,000 liras! What is all this money? It's the difference for the broken statue. What a golden heart and how lovely! She looks like a princess. The sunrise is painted by the sun And the world is covered with blue I wake up and a new morning is here You are my first thought The first nightingale that sings The first cart that moves A new morning is coming to life I am born again With you You are like a morning too You paint the sun in my eyes Where you are not It is nighttime Where you are Love is born - Girls, will you come? - Yes. - You too. - Agreed? - Yes. - See you tomorrow evening. All right, Alberto. Don't forget the records. All right. - Bye. - Bye, Rosetta. - You? - Thanks, but I can't accept! It was my fault too. I walk with my head in the clouds. Keep the money. It belongs to the antique dealer who sold the statue. - How did you know? - The antique dealer is my father. You are much better than Tamagno, Caruso and Del Monaco. - Did my brother tell you? - I heard you singing yesterday. - In Capri on the beach. - When I work, I always sing. Would you sing at my home, for fun? Tomorrow I am having a party with my schoolmates. - Want to come? - I'd love to. With pleasure. But I don't know anyone. - You know me. Isn't that enough? - Yes, of course. - I must go home now. - I don't know where you live. The door before the Belmonte antique shop. See you tomorrow. - What time? - At six. All right. - What did you do? - We went for the delivery. Hello? Yes, antique dealer Belmonte. We went to the second floor and rang the bell. Yes, Donna Rosa. Oh, sorry! What is it, Countess? Yes, I'll take your Caffè at any moment. The countess is inviting him to a "tête-à-tête." - Yes, Countess. - A "tête-à-tête" with coffee! Yes, even right away. Yes. I'll be there in a quarter of an hour. Yes, the check book is always at your disposal. Goodbye. - Will you talk? - May we? You must talk! Hurry up. - We went… - Briefer. - We went up… - Briefer! - We rang… - Briefer! - A gentleman opened… - You did everything. This is the list. Load the truck and leave tonight. - I am going to the countess. - Yes. How did he understand if he didn't let us speak? - He's a… - Brief, Gaetano! - He's a… - Briefer, Gaetano! He's a clairvoyant! Countess, I can't negotiate with you. You establish the price and I'll pay without batting an eyelash. Let's make it… eight million? - You are batting an eyelash. - I've something in my eye. - Why are you batting both eyes? - Something is in both eyes. - Is your hand shaking? - It's a nervous twitch. - You have a twitch? - I almost had a stroke! My hand only shakes when I sign over eight million lira checks. - To you. - No. Leave it on the table. I don't touch money. - It's the 13th Pippo again. - He's always here, night and day. He follows me, he persecutes me. You let him do it. - What do you mean? - You like his attention. You lean out, look at him, smile and say hello to him. - Are you jealous? - Yes. I'm as jealous as Otello, furious as Orlando, in love like Romeo. - Donna Rosa… - Countess. Let's keep a distance. The name of our happiness is Antonio. Only I can make you happy. - Really? - Yes. - You really want to make me happy? - It's all I'm waiting for. - Did you call me? - Francesco… "Accompany the gentleman." All right! No… bring us two coffees. With sugar? For eight million, you want to bring it without sugar? I've always looked for your voice In the wind that comes from faraway lands And talks about you And talks about you And talks about you And talks about you - Bravo! - Very good! Now let's all dance! - Come on! - Come on, guys! Do you want to dance with me? Come on. - Come on! - Hurry! What are you doing? Are you crazy? Why are you taking the furniture away? We're taking it away and substituting it tomorrow. But today is Rosetta's party. Take it tomorrow. - We… - We can't. It must leave tonight for Benevento, with the express courier. Don Antonio told you-- My gosh! The Count of Monte Cristo! It's not the Count of Montecristo, we brought him. - Go load. - Why did you bring him? - Look at these two... - You scare people! Excuse me. I'm getting Rosetta's cake. I'll save it! Excuse me. Watch out for the cake. Watch out. - Let's stop here. - Yes, eat. - Who cares. - Antonio. - What should we do? - The music is over. We can't dance. I'm sorry. I'll go look for another record player. - It's late. We have to go. - It was a lovely evening. - Wasn't it, guys? - Yes. - Bye, Rosetta. - Bye. You sing very well. I am not better than Callas, Moffo and Tebaldi. - I brought this for you. - Beautiful! It's Chinese enamel. A memory from Singapore. I'm glad you like it. I like it very much. Call me by my first name. - But I am a boatman. - Am I a princess? Until ten years ago, my father was a secondhand dealer and so was my grandfather. Now we sell antiques. Every day our furniture comes and goes like this evening. My party was ruined. I forgot the cake! Some furniture has remained at least! It's fine here. Inside there is my birthday wish. It’s a starfish. It brings good luck. We give it to girls in Capri to help them find happiness and love. Let's embrace like this Soul and heart Let's never leave each other Not even for an hour My desire for you Frightens me I want to live with you, always with you And never die Why bother telling each other Words of love If love can live On just a breath? If you also want This love Let's embrace like this Soul and heart If you also want This love Let's embrace like this Soul and heart Soul and heart I will blow out the candles now, as is tradition. - What were you doing in the dark? - Blowing out the candles. - Why? - It's my birthday. - Did you forget? - Where is my head? Forgive me, dear! I will make amends immediately! I'll give you a wonderful gift! Tell me what you want. The moon? The sun? The stars? - The furniture. - It's not here? No. Gaetano and Gennarino took away all the furniture. - They said you ordered it. - Yes, but I'll make amends now. We'll postpone to Sunday and I'll fill the house with furniture and friends. Why are you here? I invited him, Dad. - Okay… - Look at what he gave me. Lovely. It's a valuable gift in good taste. This is enamel! - You know how to fish well! - It's my work. I'm a sailor. No. You've an instinctive flair for artistic things. I'll show you something. What is this? - It looks like a Caffè. - Looks like it? I paid eight million and you're not sure? Take a good look. I trust you. You overestimate me. I am not a critic. I am just a passionate hobbyist. Don't stall. Tell me what you think. Is it a real Caffè? I think it's authentic. Thank goodness. You took a weight off my shoulders. Here. I won't sell it. It's my birthday present for you. Are you happy? Good evening, Donna Rosa. Duke Pippo! Why are you here? I usually stroll in the area because the pure air is good for my health. Then you have good health. You breathe a lot of this air. Yes, Countess. This air has a lovely scent. - A rose-scented perfume. - Are you hinting something, Don Pippo? I am hinting something, Donna Rosa. - Where should I stop? - Stop there. - Shall we stop here? - Stop here. - Turn off the engine. - Just a minute! All done. - Let's go. - Take it easy. Don't rush me. Let's hurry. Don Antonio is waiting for us. Did you know that God created the world in a week? "The hasty cat has blind kittens." Don Antonio, look at what we found at Forcella. - What is this trash? - A sewing machine. - This one works. - It did. No, it really works. Look. Lower this… - You are always in the way! - Can't you see that it's just old? After so many years with me, you're still not civilized! I'll fire you! I am an antique dealer not a secondhand store! Antiques! After the shop is closed tonight, I'll polish everything up. Why are you laughing, idiot? - I'm not laughing. - He's crying, and so am I. - Why? - Don't be offended! After many years of work, nobody had ever said that. - We have always worked honestly. - Our hands are clean! Show yours. No, you'd better not. Don't be offended! I didn't offend you. What did you understand? You said you'd call the police. Ignorant! Imbeciles! I said I'd polish up. I don't want old stuff anymore. Only antiques! - Authentic stuff! - Not even this? You brought another piece of trash. What is it? - A suitcase made of antique leather. - It's just dusty. Give it to me. See how lovely it is? "Don Antonio Belmonte of Roccafestina." There it is! - The evidence! - The… - The what? - The evidence! - Massage his… - What? - A heart massage! - I understood! The countess, the evidence. He had a heart attack. Come. We'll massage him. He's hot! Hurry. Call someone! Rosetta. A doctor! - Yes! - This is a heart attack! It's not a heart attack! I found the great, great grandfather's emblem on the suitcase! The crown! The balls! He had a lot of balls on his crown! There's written "Don Antonio Belmonte of Roccafestina." I am a prince! I am a prince! It means that finally my dream can come true! As of this moment, you must call me "Prince, excellency". You are my vassals, greeters and "name-spreaders". - What does that mean? - I'll explain later. My dream has come true! Forty-four… - Thirty-seven… - What is he doing? - He's making a call. - I'm betting those numbers on the lottery! - You'll lose, as usual. - Eight, two… - De Barberis home. - I'm Belmonte. Is the countess there? No, she went to Positano. To her mother's home. She went to her mother's. When is she returning? Francesco, please tell me! Mr. Belmonte, don't insist. Guess. - Let me guess. - Maybe the countess isn't returning. She'll go on vacation where she's surrounded by the sea. It has a splendid grotto. She is going to the fortress. - All right. Mum's the word! - I won't say anything else. Capri, directly to Capri. As soon as the schools end, I'm going to Capri with the princess. - Who's that? - My daughter, Rosetta. I am moving to the best hotel in the island and you will always be with me. - Dressed like this? - I will buy you new clothes! I'll buy you jackets, coats, hats, ties, shoes! - Don Antonio has gone crazy! - Yes, I've gone crazy! Over a marvelous woman. Her name is Donna Rosa So dear, beautiful Smiling and delightful And she wants me Donna Rosa may seem capricious But don't mind that because she wants me I am sincere, I will confess I just can't say no to her -Women are inconstant -I know that And Donna Rosa is snobbish It's no secret and I will prove it I send 1,000 telegrams And buy baskets of lilacs I sing 100 serenades a day But she ignores me And returns to her mother Her name is Donna Rosa So dear, beautiful, absolutely fabulous And she wants me For some, Donna Rosa is ambitious But I am sure she will marry me She wants me I am sincere, I will confess I can't say no to her - Women are inconstant… - You already said that But Donna Rosa is mysterious And this example confirms it I reserve party favors And receptions at the Grand Hotel I buy kilos of diamonds every day But she ignores me And returns to her mother Her name is Donna Rosa So dear, beautiful, smiling and delightful And she wants me Donna Rosa may seem capricious But don't mind that, she wants me I am sincere, I will confess I can't say no to her - Good morning, Prince. - Good morning, Princess. Have you decided how to spend the morning, Princess? Not yet, Prince, but don't worry. While you are visiting Capri, I'll go to the square. I have an appointment. - All right. - Princess. - Your Highness. - Remember to be careful. Excuse me. Who is that gentleman you just greeted? The Prince of Roccafestina. - He… - He has villas, castles, assets. - Buildings! - Lands! -Caffè -Plantations? - Plants? - No, valuable paintings. - Jewels, antique stuff, carriages. - He has a lot of money! Now I see why his wife is so young. - I don't… - Be quiet! That's not his wife, that's his daughter, Princess Rosetta. Her father is the prince and his daughter is the princess. Thank you. If you want more information, you can ask us. - That's enough, thank you. - You're welcome. Good day. - What are you doing? - Did you see how easy it is? - Very easy! Who are we? - Greeters and name-spreaders. First we greeted him and now we spread his name. - Hi, Andrea. - Rosetta, why are you here in Capri? I'm on holiday with Dad. I'm sorry, but the boat was already reserved. - When is this boat available? - Whenever. Tomorrow, the day after. I'm sorry. Come, Rosetta. Easy. Careful. Don't hurt yourself. - It's him. - Let's get ready. Look at how he walks! - Good morning, Prince. - Good morning, Excellency. He is so handsome. He looks like a prince! Looks like? Don't you remember the emblem on the suitcase? Of course I do. Let's check. "Noon. Greetings and reverence in the square." - Done. - "12:30." - "Call Canzone del Mare" -All right. "As for the afternoon, wait for my instructions via radio." - All right. - Let's go. I want to steal the world To give it to you What nobody has, you will have from me But you are already happy With the little I have You look at me and become rich If I give you a kiss Nothing, not even a flower Do you ask of me And you don't envy Those who have more You are content with a smile Of the little I have And in exchange I will have your love until I live The world you are looking for You will have from me The love you are looking for I will give you, I will give you I want to steal the world To give it to you What nobody has You will have from me But you are already content With the little I have And in exchange I will have your love until I live Until I live Until I live Fefè, I am tired of this life. Every day, doing nothing! Giorgio, you want to start working? No. Work and I had a huge fight! We could organize a poker game, maybe even during the day. Giorgio, why are you so interested in this prince? Fefè, you don't understand. I need the father to get to the daughter. You're old-fashioned! Today we fight for love. I may be old-fashioned, but with my system I will end up taking the princess dancing tonight. Mr. Belmonte on the phone. Mr. Belmonte on the phone. Mr. Belmonte on the phone. - Mr. Belmonte isn't here. - Scoundrels! - He's not here. - It can't be. Look here. "12:30, call Canzone del Mare." - Did the waiter understand? - I said it clear… - Did you call him? - No. I said it clearly. - I asked for Mr. Belmonte. - Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! - Mr. Belmonte is dead. - What? - All of a… - He will be furious. - All of a sudden? - No. He's alive. He didn't answer because you were to call him Prince of Roccafestina. - I understand! - You understand. Are you laughing? - No, I'll make amends! - No. I'll call him. Hello? The Prince of Roccafestina is desired on the phone. I am him. Prince. Hello? I am the Prince of Roccafestina. Idiot, moron, scoundrel! Darn them! - Is it the sailor's Madonna? - Yes. She is beautiful. There is a starfish like the one you gave me. Tonight it won't be there anymore. A happy boy will take it home. - Why? - It's an old tradition. We use a starfish to say to a girl "I love you." When she falls in love, she leaves it at the Madonna's feet. - And he understands. - If I fall in love with you, - I must leave your starfish here? - Yes, but, princesses and Cinderella’s only fall in love in fairy tales. I like fairy tales. Hello, Prince. I am Count De Barberis. Count, what a pleasure! - Please. - After you. Thank you. What a coincidence, Count De Barberis. - Yes, that's me. - Your name fills me with joy. - I know a Countess De Barberis. - Aunt Carlotta from Amalfi? - No, Donna Rosa of Naples. - She is my mother. Your mother? What a coincidence! Crazy… - I'm crazy? - I was saying it's a crazy destiny. Destiny has me meet the son of the countess. Count, this morning, as soon as I arrived, I called the villa to say hello to your mother countess. - But she wasn't there. - She is in Positano at Grandma's. - We are waiting for her. - Fine. Will she arrive tonight? Tonight, tomorrow, the next day. With Mom, you never know. She could arrive in a month. I must pay the Grand Hotel and those idiots another month? - What are you saying? - Nothing important, Count. My daughter is coming. I'd like you to have lunch with us. With pleasure. - I'm right on time, Dad. - You look like a butterfly. This is Count De Barberis. She is Rosetta di Roccafestina. - My pleasure. - I am happy and fortunate. You'll get to know each other better at the table. Please. - You first. - No, you first. - You first, Prince. - Thank you. Her name is Donna Rosa So dear, beautiful and delightful She loves me Andrea! - You're not coming to eat? - He doesn't eat because he's in love! - With who? - Try to guess! As long as she's a good girl and loves you. - Mom, you know her. - It's Rosetta. She brought you the 50,000 liras. - So it's true! - She even kissed him! Andrea, I'm not telling you anything. I don't want to demoralize you but I'm your mom. If you laugh today, I don't want you to cry tomorrow. We are what we are. She is a girl who dresses well, speaks well… and can give us 50,000 liras. To her father they say, "Good morning, Prince." They have villas, castles, lands. They are very rich. Maybe Pietro is exaggerating, but you must not get your hopes up. For your wellbeing. - Count, may I ask you a question? - Please. - How long do you stay in Capri? - Four, five months. - So long? - To please Mom. - You don't like it? - Tourists who don't come often like it. - I stay the whole season. - You're complaining? I'd stay my whole life. It's an enchanting island. The people are all the same. Northern blonds, old American women. What a bore! In the evening, we play the usual poker game. It's the only excitement we have left. - Oh, you play? - Yes, sure. - You play for lots of money? - Depends on the table and friends. Didn't you say you get bored? Until yesterday, but this morning you arrived, Princess. - Call me Rosetta. - Thanks. My name is Giorgio. So, I changed the face of the island? Yes, and if my company pleases you, with the Prince's permission, I'd like to discover the beauties of Capri with you. - Until the poker begins? - Poker? What is this poker? Prince, what is this poker? It's a game where, if you aren't good, you lose the county! Rosy. Rosy! Children, stop. Wait. - Rosy. - What is it? I'm playing. - Your orange juice. - I don't want it. Don't say that. The princess will be angry with me. I'll tell Mom that I didn't drink it. Princess the mother, princess the daughter! She is the woman I was looking for! Stop a moment! - What do you want? - This game is old. We like it and will do it anyway. You don't know the overturned Blind Man's Bluff? - How is it played? - I'll explain. You are all blindfolded and must catch the princess who isn't. - This boy is right. Blindfold yourselves! - Yes, let's blindfold ourselves! - We are ready. We can begin. - Rosy, run. We'll catch you! - Why did you take me away? - So they look for you and won't find you. It's fun! - But then I'm not playing. - Play being engaged to me. - How is it played? - We hold hands and you give me a kiss. - And then? - Then… I still don't know. I must see what my brother is doing. Your Excellency! Your Excellency! - Prince! - Your Excellency! - What is going on? - We were at the countess' villa. - She's here! - Is she here? She's here! - Is he ill? - Nothing happened! I am excited. The countess is here. Flowers! I must send her flowers! Her name is Donna Rosa So lovely, smiling and delightful And she wants me Donna Rosa may seem capricious But don't mind that. She wants me I am sincere, I will confess I can't say no to her - Women are inconstant… - I know that And Donna Rosa is finicky It's not a secret and I have proof I reserve party favors And receptions at the Grand Hotel I buy kilos of diamonds every day But she doesn't care and returns to Mom - Are you making fun of me? - I'm just singing. Each man has his Rosa. Andrea! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hi. - Hi. Is your boat still taken by the girl with the straw hat? - She is leaving to go to Marina Grande. - That is why I came to Marina Piccola. - Is the boat available? - Yes, it is. - Let's take a ride in the sea! - Yes, all right. You Italian lover? No. I am a Neapolitan from Capri. Mom, sorry if I didn't come sooner but I was changing. Tell me so I can get angry right away. What did you do during my absence? No trouble. I met an heiress. The daughter of the Prince of Roccafestina. Houses, villas, land, buildings! We've solved our problems! I'll marry her and pay for everything. It's not enough. You should marry a Rockefeller! Mom, don't exaggerate. That girl has lots of money. Just look at her father. I just got back and flowers are already arriving. - Where should I put them? - In the living room. - It's full. There are 18 baskets. - Who is this madman? The Principe of Roccafestina. He had a call made from Canzone del Mare to know if and when the countess could receive him. - Put them on the table. - Mom, receive him right away. Help me. I have a date with his daughter. We'll go in the speedboat. Don't worry. This marriage interests me too. - Thank you, Mom! - Francesco, what time is it? - 3:53. - I'll receive him at teatime. Andrea, what are you thinking about? - I'm thinking of work. - Always work? - Almost always. - Don't you ever think of love? Pippo is here too! I don't know what this lamppost hopes for! - Mr. Belmonte wants to see you. - Who brought him? - I don't know. He's out here. - I am here, Countess! - I'm sorry. I can't receive you. - Why? It's five o'clock. At five I am seeing the Prince of Roccafestina. - He's arrived. - Is he out there? He's here. I am here! - Are you a prince? - Yes, of Roccafestina. - I found the genealogical connection. - Please. Thank you, Countess. - Roccafestina, tell me something. - Principe of Roccafestina. Are you really so rich? Yes, and if you say yes, Countess, I will put my wealth at your feet. Everything in due time. Why? Your deceased husband can no longer appear. - He can't scratch our feet. - Change the subject, Roccafestosa. "Roccafestina." Please don't garble the name. My Giorgio is in love with your daughter and I ask for her hand. - What do you say? - I am happy, very happy! We are creating our first bond. The waves of the sea are there I am here on the beach thinking of you The sun is setting on me But I don't care If you're not here This sun doesn't warm me up anymore The bottom of my heart is too cold Love, come back There is a longing In my soul for you This sun doesn't warm me up anymore In my mind there is a cold goodbye Come back, love There is a longing In my soul for you Happy seagulls fly over me If I could fly I'd fly Far away and look for you The summer is sad If you're not here This sun doesn't warm me up anymore In my mind there is a cold goodbye Love, come back There is a longing In my soul for you Our children are nice together. Yes, they are. They seem to be made for each other. - Did you hear something? - A breeze. - What did you hear now? - A stronger breeze. What does he want? - You're smiling at him? - They're my friends. They feel encouraged. You don't have exclusive access. You're just a contestant. Rosetta, when I found out from Mom that you said yes, I jumped for joy like a child. - With a rope? - Rosetta, you're joking! Even if you are cynical, love at first sight has always existed. Andrea, let's go. Yes, let's go. Fefè, you say you are a great musician. - Play something nice for us. - What? Get the trumpet and show what you can do. -Help -We are coming You can't do anything You will be shocked With a kiss, we'll knock you out here - Say help! - Help We are coming Let us kiss you to feel this shock We are us, we are us And not the others It's tough luck for all of you Countess, may I dance this boogie-woogie with you? - With pleasure, Prince. - Thank you. - Countess, you are a feather. - Yes, I was born to dance. - Like Ginger Rogers. - No. Tap dancing is not for me. I am more like Carla Fracci. Pink shoes and a tutu. You'd look lovely with a tutu. - Who is it? - It's me. - What do you want? - I'd like the lady. - She is dancing with me. - Prince, it's the custom. Donna Rosa, I wore out 1,000 pairs of shoes and I don't know if… S'il vous plaît Everyone wants my mother. I'll go save her. - Prince, may I? - You too? Family matters. Mom, let's go. Follow me. Rosetta, where are you going? - To get some air. - You're leaving your boyfriend? He left me to play poker. Don't be upset. It's customary to play poker among nobles. Yes, Dad. - Will you return here? - I will go to the hotel. All right. I'm staying. I want to see what your Giorgio does. - I'll join you soon. - All right. - Good night, Dad. - Good night, Rosetta. Her name is Donna Rosa… I am sad because tomorrow I'm returning home. Sweden is lovely. I've been there. When you kissed me, it was a beautiful moment. Will you give me a goodbye kiss? - What are you doing here? - It's hot in the house. - It's late. Go to sleep. - Rosetta saw you. She was there. A fisherman who sings about his solitude The moon above the nets That seem to be crying Sea water in my eyes The last night with you I know I will miss you every moment I will be a sail without wind You know that my life Needs you But you are leaving, you are leaving The blue color of my dreams is dying The darkness of the night frightens me What is summer If it just gets your hopes up And then has you suffer the pains of love The moonlight that colors my solitude The last words of love That are bigger than we are Sea water in my eyes The desire to love inside of you You know that my life Needs you Each day more and more, and more Two tens. One seven. Three aces. A Queen, probably a straight. - The three aces check. - You'll check. Three million. - I pass. - I pass. I call. I don't think you have a straight. Yes, I do. I'm sorry. You owe me another five and a half million. - Then we'll continue. - No, enough. You are losing 20 million. You forced the game and cannot even return a tenth of this amount. You are very rude! I won't play anymore! - I will pay you tomorrow. - No, I want to be paid now. Sign a check. - Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. - We are three. We have to stop. - No, just a moment. - May I take his place? - Yes, with pleasure. - Thank you. - We'll have fun! - Duke, do I make you laugh? - No! - Who deals the cards? - You, Prince. - Thank you, Duke. - You're welcome. I haven't touched cards in 20 years. Sorry, I'm out of practice. My hands are rusty. It's a matter of practice, but then you get the hang of it. One, two, three, four. To you, and you, and you, and me. I'm sorry for what I said to you at the nightclub. I am waiting for the day when you don't have to apologize. - You don't do anything right. - I lost tonight. - How much? - Twenty. - 20,000 liras? - Twenty million. - Twenty million! Who do you owe it to? - Attorney Rossi. You'll solve it yourself this time. - How? - Have him wait a year or two. - He wanted a check. - Did you sign it? Yes, because Prince of Roccafestina was there too. You shouldn't have signed! We have no money in our bank accounts! - I've nothing more to sell! - Not even a painting? I only have imitations. You sold the originals! When I marry Rosetta, I'll pay back everything. All right, but get out of my sight! I am going to take a bath. I'll come give you a kiss before going to bed. A token, please. Thank you. Hello? Hello? Hello? Duke Pippo della Corte asks to urgently be received - even if it is late. - What does he want? I want everything, Countess! Love, desire, an overwhelming passion! You have a passion at midnight? Unfortunately, when I embraced you while we were dancing my passion reached its height! Countess, I kneel before you. - And ask for your hand. - I'm sorry. You are too late. Attorney Rossi just asked for my hand. - At midnight? - Yes. I had a passion too. No, Countess. You can't marry a plebeian, a miser, a shark! I am the right man for you! I will make you happy. I'll free you from your anguish. - I admit I feel something for you. - Donna Rosa… You are young and handsome and have an important name. You are better than attorney Rossi. - I can still cancel. - Do so, Donna Rosa. Cancel it! But I must tell you something first. Don't look at me. What I will say embarrasses me. Tell me. The 13th Pippo della Corte. - It is the moment of truth. - Yes. I don't have any money. Everything is mortgaged and confiscated. If you are really in love, you must take me as you see me. Only with my nightgown. You're not saying anything? - You? - Yes. - Duke Pippo? - He ran away. He ran away when he heard you have no money. I told you. He just wanted your dowry. Countess, don't get angry. This is the sum that your son lost tonight at poker. It is the attorney's check for 20 million. - You paid it back for my son. - I won it for you, Countess. Mom, a good night kiss. - Prince of Roccafestina, what a surprise! - Yes, I am a man full of surprises! - This is your check. - Thanks, Dad! - I don't like it. No "Dad." - Why not? I'll tell you why! You ruined a noble family! You sold two buildings, this villa, three lands! - Mom! - Squanderer! He sold a Salvator Rosa, a Caffè, a De Chirico! - He is a cannibal! - Didn't you forget something? - Yes, this! - You are a countess! A countess? Your father was a count! - My mother sold fish in Rome! - You've remained a plebeian! I'm proud of it! Leave this house and look for a job! Yes, I'm going! If you sign another piece of paper, I will send you to jail! All the children of the nobles end up like this! I can't stand it anymore! I want to live my old age serenely. Countess, you are still young. - Call me Donna Rosa! - Thank you, Donna Rosa. It's almost midnight. I must make a phone call. Hello, Mr. Rossi? I don't want to marry you. Now nor ever! I don't like you! Even at my age, a little love is needed! - Bravo, Countess! - No, call me Donna Rosa! - I can call you that? Then I can hope? - Hope? You must! - Prince of Roccafonduta. - No, Roccafestina! - Don't ruin the family name. - Who cares! Time passes. We don't have time to lose! - Will you give me your hand? - Hand, arm, leg! - Whatever you want! - I am so happy! I'll give you kilos of diamonds, I'll cover you with lilacs. - I won't ignore you. - You won't return to your mother? - No! - Her name is Donna Rosa… Princess of Roccafestina! Me! - Buying lovely lilacs... - Prince. Prince. - Who is it? - Sorry to disturb you in the street. Go ahead. What is it? - You don't know me. - I don't have the pleasure. I'm the mother of Andrea the Canary. Yes, the Canary, the boatman. The boy who is an antique expert. - How is he? - Fine, but I am worried. Why? He is a good boy. Yes, he's a good boy and is in love with your daughter. - Madam! - I know, Prince! You are noble and we are poor, sea people, simple people. I told Andrea many times not to get his hopes up. - Yes. Does my daughter know? - Yes, Prince. She loves him too. In the silence of my thoughts I always listen to your voice And I feel myself taken away To a world that is no longer mine With you What can I do? You tell me The time I have left is slipping away And I love you as I've never loved And I love you as I've never loved Every day I look at the world and I realize That I am not alone But I am so melancholy In this world made of emptiness Without you What can I do? You tell me The time that I have left Is slipping away And I love you as I've never loved before And I still love you As I've never loved before Never loved before Never loved before - Where are we going? - I'll tell you later. Take this. - What do I need it for? - I'll tell you later. - Andrea! - Rosetta! - Where is the star? - Here it is! - How old are you? - Six. Come here in 12 years, put the star at the Madonna’s feet, so we will get engaged and embrace like they're doing. THE END
