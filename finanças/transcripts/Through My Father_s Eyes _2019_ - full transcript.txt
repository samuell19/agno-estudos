As the years pass by but no memories fade... every step I take, the mistakes that I've made... yet his words still echo, scream loud in my ears... but I just can't remember after all these years. Every once in a while, you cross paths with someone who changes the meaning or definition, of what you think is possible. In a world full of creeks and ponds, I was finally introduced to an ocean. I first met Ronda back in 2010. She was sitting right here, sweat-stained and beautiful. But beauty didn't hide a spirit and a fire of someone I knew was on a mission. Yeah, she was special. But nothing ever came easy for Ronda. When she was born, they thought she was dead. On a cold winter day in 1987, a tiny Ronda Jean Rousey brought chaos into the local Riverside Community delivery room. I don't have a pulse. What's it look like? Not clear. It's unclear. She went unresponsive. Hypoxia had brought Ronda's little heart to a sudden and abrupt stop. I'm not sure she's gonna make it. Doctors fought for what seemed to be an eternity to cut her umbilical cord from around her neck and then administered child CPR. It's the only time I ever saw my husband cry. I mean, when she was born, he... we thought she was dead. Little did we know, this tiny, little fighting spirit would change the perception of women in sports, some 20 years later. This entire crowd is on their feet for the arrival of the first ever. UFC Women's Bantamweight champion, Rowdy Ronda Rousey. This is a gigantic cultural moment, Mike. This is not just a moment for Ronda Rousey. This is a moment for women's sports, period. She's changing sports, she's changing culture. This is a huge moment and we can't think of any better person to carry the weight of this moment. It was just before Christmas in 2010... when I received a call from my producing partner, Pete Antico. He wanted me to interview his friend of 30 years, the Godfather of Grappling, "Judo" Gene LeBell. I arrived in the heart of North Hollywood at the Hayastan gym, home of MMA great, Gokor Chivichyan. Gene, of course, lived up to his larger-than-life reputation. And if somebody has... a bad attitude here, comes in with a chip on his shoulder, we give him what we call an "attitude adjustment." But it was someone else who caught my eye. In the midst of all the blood, sweat and tears was a beautiful young girl. Her name was Ronda Rousey. I know you teach men here, but do you teach women? Do you teach women to fight? Only pretty ones. But the ugly ones, no. Well, in here we've got the first woman world champion... judo. And this is her beautiful daughter, Ronda, and, uh, she won a medal in the Olympics. She's had two matches, and both of them have lasted... less than a round, - less than a minute, right? - Yes. I'm gonna leave you 'cause I've got to get back to the men 'cause they're easier. When we went down to the gym, we met Ronda, and I brought, of course, my partner, Gary Stretch, with me. And after one meeting, he asked me if Gary would work with Ronda, you know, boxing, because I had told him he could fight a little bit. Presenting the former undefeated. Light Middleweight Champion of England, Gary Stretch! Yeah, he can fight a little bit. Ronda intrigued me. What is this beautiful, young girl doing in a male-dominated world of MMA? My curiosity had got the better of me, and I wanted to find out more. So off I went to Santa Monica to meet her amazing mother, AnnMaria. Who took me back to the very beginning. An Apgar Score is what you get when a baby is born. It's from, like, zero to ten, and essentially zero means you have a dead baby. You know, that there's no... They're not breathing, they're blue, there's no muscular tone, there's no reflex. Right when they're first born, and then they do it again after a minute. And I think her first one was zero. And then, the next one I think was a three. So it means they got her breathing then, and she had a lot of problems early on that they thought stemmed from that. They're delayed in learning to talk. She would have problems with frustration. Okay, if she got frustrated, you know, she would kick us. When she was little, she was just really upset - because she couldn't talk. - So she hasn't changed at all. She would try to say things and it wouldn't come out. She would say, "I want the 'globalol.'" It was... "What?" It was just heartbreaking and she... I remember she said to me, "Mom..." one time, "Mom, I'm dumb." I said, "You're not dumb." She says, "No, I'm dumb. Maria, Jennifer." And she couldn't even say Jennifer's name. "They know the words." I don't know the words." Really, I didn't talk until I was six. I would say things, I would know what I meant, but what came out of my mouth was, like, gibberish. So, did your mom understand you? Um, no. It turns out my sisters were the ones that understand me. I'd go, "Blah, blah, blah," and they're like, "Oh, she wants chocolate milk and cookies." Like, I don't know. I had my own little language. And, uh, she actually has a long, funny story about me trying to get a birthday present one year and asking for a "ballgrin," and it turns out a "ballgrin" was a Hulk Hogan wrestling buddy. That's how I said Hulk Hogan was "ballgrin." It wasn't a conscious thing, but we... Jen and I knew what she was saying. Even when my mom couldn't make anything out, her, you know, her preschool teachers, nobody could make it out, but Jen and I just knew. When Ronda was three years old, due to a gunshot too close to home and the escalating crime in Riverside, the family decided to move to Minot, North Dakota with a population of 40,000 people. It was actually because of my speech problem, my speech therapist said that I had to spend more one-on-one time with a parent because my sisters were talking for me a lot. They lived in two separate houses because, you know, North Dakota's a big state and he worked in Devil's Lake and she worked in Minot. So, during the week I'd spend all my time with him. - Just with him? - Just with him, so, yeah, - I was total Daddy's Girl. - So you had a very special bond. - Yeah. - No boys in the family? I was the closest thing they had. - Yeah? - Yeah. Tell me about that. Well, apparently my dad swore that I was going to be a boy, and the whole pregnancy, he was like, "It's gonna be a boy. It's gonna be Ron, Ronald Junior," or something like that. - Is your dad's name Ron? - Yeah, his name's Ron. Ronald John Rousey. So then it turns out I was a girl. So then he was like Ron-da. Yeah, that's the only one I got in school, Ron-da. I was always worried about her, and he's just, "Don't worry." He would take her out to his workshop and say, "We're gonna make a gun," and she would draw. She's a really good artist. And she would draw something on a piece of paper and he would go and get some machine in the workshop and cut the gun out and make a wood gun, and they would go out in his four-wheel drive and drive around and he would have his real pistol and his gun and she would have her little wood gun and do all this crazy stuff. Ronda's father said, "You could be a champion of anything you want. You're gonna be an Olympic swimming champion." Yes, everyone was, like, really worried about me all the time, and my dad was the one that always told me that, "You know, you're a sleeper." You're gonna show everybody. "You're going to the Olympics one day" and he said, "She's fine. She'll come out of it", and she's gonna surprise everybody." Ronda's father flew out to New York state where I was training, and asked me to marry him about three weeks before the world championship. And I told him I would think about it, which didn't please him very much, but I told him he should be happy because he was the only one in the running. He was the kind of guy that if you met him, he would give you the impression that his whole purpose in getting up that morning was to meet you, you know? When people talk about someone being a people person... When my mom and Ron got married, that's what two people who really love each other, that's what a marriage is like. They were completely in love. They had, you know... I mean, nobody has a perfect marriage. You know, they argued at times and things, but they were always on the same page, and they always really wanted what was best for us. It's kind of sad for my mom 'cause I could tell that, like... she's never fully come back from that. What happened? Well, my dad had a disease that was, like, one in a million people. It's called Bernard-Soulier syndrome, and... it's similar to hemophilia, like your platelets are too big and too few. They can't link together, so when you get cut or you bleed, you can't clot your blood. We all went sledding one day and we had these huge hills, like, around the house, we lived in the country in Minot, North Dakota, you know, and I must have been like, you know, four years old or something like that, and he was testing out a new hill for us, and there was, like, a snowbank with a log covered in snow. He shot down the hill and he hit the log and he broke his back. Yeah, he had surgery and he was in intensive care for months, and then it never really did heal up. So, he was in and out of hospitals. He went to the Mayo Clinic and after several years, it got to where he could do less and less. You know, he went from being this guy who was out hunting and four-wheeling and playing racquetball three times a day to barely being able to walk. I always knew that there was something a little bit wrong with him, but no one ever told us that he was dying or anything. He said that he did not want to be, you know, just gradually growing more and more debilitated until the last thing his kids remember was him in a bed with 20 tubes running in and out of him. He said, "I'm not going to put you through this, the girls." There was, like, this one pond we used to go out to and skip rocks in all the time. And he... went out there one day and put a hose in the exhaust and killed himself. And then, um... You know, I was eight and I was... I didn't even know he was dying up to then. So, for... pretty much all of the time that my dad was alive, everyone was... That I remember, everyone was lying to me and told me... I thought he was fine. He was dying in front of me the whole time I knew him, so... A parent who believes in you wholeheartedly, in everything you can do and everything that you're going to be, and can see potential in you when nobody else can or when other people discount you and then have that person just disappear off the face of the Earth, you know, I mean, that affects you for the rest of your life. He didn't want them to know. He said, "You know, let them have a happy childhood." He died right in, like, the peak stage of a kid's mind, when like, your dad's the coolest, most right person in the world when you're eight years old. You know, like, your dad could beat up anybody and your dad's right about everything. You know, just sort of the whole world fell in. I mean, it takes a lot to make me cry. I think I've cried maybe three times since I was eight years old, and I sat in my living room and cried for a week. Did you see him that morning? I think I did. But, you know, the funny thing, I couldn't remember the last thing he said to me. I couldn't remember... if it was, "Goodbye," or I don't remember if it was, "Put your clothes on." I was... I had a... I was a little nudist as a kid. I was constantly running around the house stark naked, so he would either say, "Bye" or, "Put your clothes on," as he left the house. I forgot which one it was. - I hope it was "Bye." But who knows? Yep. With her husband passing, AnnMaria now left with the daunting task of raising three young girls alone, decided to head west to the sunshine state of California in search of a brighter future. That was really hard on Ronda too. In fact, for a semester, she was homeschooled, because she just hated going to school so much. I went from, you know, being in the same class of kids, like, the same 20 or something kids from, you know, first to fourth grade, to moving to Los Angeles where, you know, I'm a little white girl with a North Dakota accent in a 99 percent Mexican school. So how did you pick up the pieces? There wasn't any other choice, you know? I remember one of my friends saying something to me about how could you, after your husband died, you know, build up a business and move to L.A. and... and start all over, and I said, "Well, really, there's only two choices:". Let the rest of your life suck or not." And I picked option B. Did you get closer, do you think? Or was there distance for a while? - I know you're very close now. - I think all of us got closer. When her father... committed suicide, she could no longer swim. That was her connection with her dad, but her mother, AnnMaria, took her and introduced her to Kodokan Judo, and that changed her whole life. Her mother was the first American world champion, male or female, in judo. She's an amazing woman. World champion, AnnMaria Burns. I would go and teach judo once a week or so. I had a friend who had a club out in Baldwin Park and she would come along every now and then, and she said, "I wanna do judo." I'm wanna quit swimming and do judo." And I said, "No, you don't." You know, you made the Junior Olympics in swimming." "And besides, if you do judo," your mom is always the first person to win the world championships in this country. Everyone is going to expect too much of you. "Do your own thing. You know, stick with swimming." And one day my friend, Hayward, was listening to me have this argument with her, and he says, "AnnMaria, nobody remembers you. Let the kid do whatever she wants." So I did. And there you go. So, what were your first impressions when she switched to judo? She... It was pretty early on, maybe within the first year, that it was noticeable she was better. She was noticeably more talented than the other kids. A lot of girls had a head start on me actually. A lot of the girls I would fight. I... I started behind, pretty much, and so my mom... kind of instilled in me from the very beginning was like, "You're starting behind," so every single day you have to train more than they did "and eventually you'll catch up." So, your first judo bout was the tournament? It was a tournament. It was funny. I walked in there, and I threw the girl right away and I won, but my mom told me, 'cause there's so many kids that you pin them and all the commands are in Japanese, so the referee will say something, and they'll just stand up and walk away. So she said, "If you pin this girl," I don't care what they do, what happens, make them pull you off of the kid. "Don't let them up." So, I threw the kid right away and I already won, but I was down in this pin and I was, like, running around in a circle in this pin, I wouldn't let the girl up. They had to, like, you know, pretty much tap me and pull me off of the girl, and then I fought the same girl again and the same thing happened. I threw her right away, I wouldn't get up. I was just, like, on her, on the ground. I refused to get off the ground. This poor girl was already beaten and I was, like, still down there. There's that thing where you refuse to lose, no matter who they are, no matter how big they are, no matter what they are, you are not gonna let this person beat you. And it's that thing that I saw in her pretty early on, probably in the first year or so. When she was, like, eighth, ninth grade, up until she went off for her first Olympics, I would take her to practice... seven... usually six or seven times a week. Just in those car rides over to practice, I didn't know she was just building me up and building me up and just telling me. Like, just giving me, like... She has her sayings I would hear over and over and over. Like, "Jesus, Mom." you know? "Champions always do more, champions always do more." Stuff like that. I didn't want her to just become an imitation of me, 'cause I see people do that and then your child doesn't develop their own style, you know? - Sure. - They just try and be like you. So I taught her a couple of things. There's a throw... There's a picture in the hallway of me doing a throw at the world championships that I kind of did all the time. So I taught her that throw. When Ronda was about 13, I started taking her to Hayastan that Gokor and Gene ran, and back before they had the really nice place they have now. The kind of rundown gym up in the corner of the strip mall. She was a young kid, and I was always playing with her, throwing her left, right, and then the ground fighting, and trying to make her understand that how important passing the legs and arm bar and choke and those kinds of things. I've known and trained with Gokor since he was actually able to take my belt off and hogtie my hands and feet together and grab me by the belt and put me in my mother's lap. Like, he would literally has been beating me up for that long. When I took the belt and tightened her up, like the legs, arms, neck together and put her, like, in one ball like this, and then I pick her up like this and hang her somewhere and she started crying and then the mom said, "Gokor, what you doing, what you doing?" Then I pick her up and give her to Mom and everything. He can't hogtie me anymore, though. I don't think so. I wouldn't dare him to, though. I'd get really embarrassed. I started wrestling, freestyle wrestling, in 1968 when I was five years old. How long did you wrestle? I wrestled approximately five years, but in the mid-time, three years later, I start doing sambo because I was wrestling and then I'd look and there's the sambo guys that are training over there, and I said "I can beat them." Well, sambo is just a regular Russian art. It's a combination judo and wrestling and has specialized leg locks. I did also the combat, which is punch, kicking, and with no uniform and do the rest, other things. So they give me a kurtka, so they're called kurtka in sambo. So I put it on and tied it up and go and beat a lot of good guys over there. And then, one time, the sambo instructor asked me, "There's a tournament, if you want to join." So I go to the tournament. I took first place, and my first real fight, I had a shooto fight in Japan in 1984, which is six-man contest and I win the whole match in the same day. Four fights I did in one day, and that's when my real career started. Not only is he a hell of a martial artist, he's a really good person. Like I said, when I started taking her there when she was 13 or 14, and I travel a lot, so sometimes her older sister would take her, and Maria would come straight from St. Monica's Catholic High School cheerleading practice. So she's in her St. Monica's High School cheerleader outfit with her, you know, 14-year-old sister on the mat, and I'm not so sure how this is gonna go with a bunch of... you know, Armenian guys. No one, especially the girls in judo, no one wanted to train at Hayastan because they thought we were rough, we were crazy. She trained with animals. We were part of those animals. Men, guys, would not come train with the Hayastan team, because we had a "bad reputation" of being too rough and hurting our opponents, which was bullshit. But we had that rep. Because we were always, at a team tournament, our team always took the first place. Every tournament. And so, I called Gokor. You know, "I've heard a lot of stuff about your gym." Give me your word, and that's good enough for me." And he said, "You send your daughter." Anybody hurts your daughter, anybody who's disrespectful to her older sister, "I will personally kill him." She come to train judo, to compete with my guys, but she study, she learned grappling from us. That is the owner of this fine gym and will show you around. He's the Armenian Assassin. He's the best teacher in the country. Bar none. Gene, I know the day I come to America, you know. I come to America in 1980. I meet Gene and this is it. Since today, it's 2015. Every time I open dojos and Gene always come, and a lot of people, they're thinking this is Gene's school. And they're asking me, "This is a Gene LeBell school?" Sometimes I say, "Yeah, why not?" You know, he's my friend. He's my teacher. He's my family. He's like a father to me, you know? Gene is fabulous. I heard about Gene when I was a little kid. Everybody in judo knows Gene. Gene was a legend and he's very modest about it. It's nice to be a legend. What's it pay? The guy that taught me was "Judo" Gene LeBell, toughest guy in the world, not according to him. He trained Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, a lot of guys. Anyone I've ever known that knows anything about stunts knows who he is. It's funny, I knew him before I knew who he was. When I was just a little kid at judo tournaments, he would hand me a patch and it said, "Break a leg. It means good luck." And it showed him like pretzling some guy's leg up, and I just thought that was funny. He won the national championship's Grand Open back in the '50s. The grand championships are where they have everyone who won every weight division in judo in the nationals fight off. So it's, like, all weights. It's insane. It's crazy to do, but Gene won. So, Gene LeBell is like a father to me. A lot of the fights that I've had in the beginning, some he was in the corner for, some he was in the audience. I could hear him yelling for, "Stick your thumb in his eyes! Stick your elbow in his eye," you know? You're going way out here. You don't have to go out there. Just there, you got it. Don't worry, I'm okay. Submission-wise, Gene LeBell has every submission that Brazilian jujitsu has and thousands more. You know, you've probably heard it said where he's forgotten more than we'll ever learn. He's truly, truly the essence of that statement. You got to do it again and pull his head forward. See how much easier the foot goes in? Key lock the leg. Arm bar, arm bar here. Choke. Good. When was the first time you started to fight? Well, I tried to fight with my mother when I was three years old, but she had such a good left hook. She knocked me into the nickel seats. I got into the fighting because my mother had an auditorium with boxing and wrestling. So I was around boxers and wrestlers all my life. And they were men and I was a kid. You know, he kind of encouraged a lot of things that I disapproved of. You know, what if there was... He would have her fight these huge guys, and I said, "Gene, it's a bad idea. You know, she's 125 pounds, fighting some 180-pound guy." And he's, "Oh, she's tough. She can take him." "Gene, that's not the point, how tough she is." If that guy happens to fall on her knee, "you know, she's gonna get hurt." So, he and I would have a lot of these discussions. It doesn't matter if I threw her, or if Gokor threw her, or some other guy or girl threw her, she would get pissed and cry. She couldn't handle a loss. She would fight and all the guys are beating her up, she would just... cry and fight. Cry and fight, you know? That was her attitude. I think that's what made her. I would yell, I'm like... I would literally say like, 'cause her lip would come out, and I'm like, "Suck your lip back and get on the mat, Ronda," and then I would say some stupid joke, and... And she would, kind of like, smile, and I'm like, "Ah, I saw the smile. You can't fool me now. Get on the mat and start doing judo." But you knew she had that fire, that competitive fire. She had it in her, and they were, like, that's already enough. With the sport she's doing, that's enough to boil. That's gonna fuel her. I remember her kind of being shy, but when she was on the mat, it was like a different story. You could tell, she'd, like... She would push you. You know, she wanted to train. That's what it was, and she wanted to get better. She goes to jujitsu tournament and she fight in the black belt division. She fight one, two fights and then the rest other girls don't want to fight her. And I tell her, I say, "Why they don't wanna fight you?" She said, "Oh, they tell me..." They're telling me you're hitting them hard in the floor." I said, "Jujitsu have any rules you cannot throw the person hard?" "No." I said, "So?" "Yeah, but they don't wanna fight, and some of them cry." Now you got beat up a lot at school. - I didn't get beat up. - Not physically. No, but you said they used to call you names? Oh, Miss Man. - They called you Miss Man? - Yeah. Well, that was... - That was in high school. - You were a man and gay. Oh, you know, people are mean in high school and that was back before martial arts was cool, so, yeah. I would wear jackets every single day, like, zip-up jackets, and it would be 80 degrees out and I would be sweating, but I would be so scared of anyone seeing my arms that I would just hide them in those jackets all the time. Yeah, I was Biceps, Guns, Guns McGee, Miss Man. And how did you respond? - By getting in a bunch of fights. - Yeah? - Yeah. - And winning all. Yeah, but that didn't really help me out too much. Didn't really help me become more popular. - Miss More Man. - No, it got me... It got me put into anger management, which I thought I was managing my anger fine. I would have gotten into a lot more fights, though, if I didn't fear the wrath of my mother more than anything. Though, it's funny. A lot of times I'd end up getting in fights, and the other kid would end up, you know... not so well, but I would be in the office crying, and everyone at school the next day would be saying how I got beat up in a fight because they saw me in the office crying, but especially 'cause my mother was coming and I had the fear. She said, "My favorite teacher and the best teacher I've ever had" and the one that taught me all these arm bars, was my mother, AnnMaria. "Don't mess with her." AnnMaria always said to her... "You are better than me." When your mom is a world champion, and she says, "You're better than me," that's the biggest compliment. Being a world champion in judo is so difficult and growing up and looking at your mom, she's a world champion and she's got the fighter's... that heart, and her mom tells her, "You are better than me." She is better than her mom. So following in her mother's very talented shoes, off Ronda went to the San Jose State University Center for the 2004 Olympic Judo Trials. Ronda Rousey of Santa Monica, California with 40-year-old veteran Grace Jividen. And that's gonna be the end of the match! Ronda Rousey has won a spot on the United States Olympic Team. My mom was, kind of, like, more of my mentor through it, she... making sure that, you know, I was making the right choices and training with the right people, and that I didn't just be a jerk because winning does that to people. So Ronda made the Olympic team at a mere 17 years of age and off she went to Athens. She didn't medal. In fact, her first match, she threw the woman flat, and they didn't call it. In fact, I thought I just had imagined... You know, I'm biased. When somebody sent me the tape afterwards, I was so mad. I had to go out and, like, run for eight miles. I was so furious. She took it upon herself to not... To kind of mold me more of my mental... Like, how I could deal with that much amount of pressure at, like, a young age. My mom's actually a developmental psychologist. That's what she got her PhD in, so I didn't give her enough credit from the beginning that she, kind of... I always thought she was always trying to shoot me down, but she was trying to just keep me from building up this ego, which I think is funny. People come up to me all the time and they're like, "I can't believe it, you're so nice." I'm like, "What did you expect me to do? Like a lock up and punch you in the face?" Like, I don't know. So in 2008, Ronda earned a second shot to fulfill her and her father's lifelong dream of attaining gold at the Beijing Olympics. After a grueling tournament, Ronda fought hard, becoming the first America woman to earn an Olympic medal in judo. I missed him a lot the last two Olympics, 'cause it was like his thing, you know? And at the last Olympics, we got the... The flag that was on his coffin and I wanted to bring it up on the podium but they wouldn't let me. But we got to, like... My mom and them got to wave it around in the stands a little bit when I was fighting. So... it would have been nice to have him there 'cause it was, kind of, like, I only got set out to do the Olympics because of him, I think. Up until the day he died, he was telling me I could go to the Olympics. So I got back from the Olympics, and I threw the first pitch at the Dodgers game and the guy behind me had, like, a little kid and they let him, like, hold my medal and take pictures and he said he owned a bar and I was, like, "Oh, I wanna be a bartender." And so, the guy gave me a bartending job with, like, no experience, which is actually kind of funny. But I ended up getting, like, two more bartending jobs. Like, one was on the beach in Malibu at Gladstone's and one was, like, on Crenshaw and Adams in the middle of Crenshaw. Yeah, I pretty much spent, like, six months just drunk from free alcohol. So at least I did it economically by working. She was really down though, after she came back, and she didn't know what she wanted to do with her life and I think 'cause her whole life had been focused on winning a gold medal, and then she didn't. And so you either have to wait four years, and who knows what happens in four years, and so she was trying to figure it out. When we first met Ronda, she was working three jobs, I remember. A lot of hours, a lot of dedication. All I know, she's always... comes and says, "I'm sorry I missed your last class because I didn't have no gas and I didn't have no money to put gas in my car and come." I always feel bad for her. You know why? She's an Olympian medalist, a world champion. If she lives in another country, they would give her a lot of money for this. Olympian medalist world champion don't have no money to put gas to come to training. This is the one thing in United States. They put in a lot of money, the one guy is throwing the ball one place to another, they give him millions of dollars. Another girl brings the American flag all over the world to stay in the champion and have no money to put gas in the cars. I knew she was working at Gladstone's, but I never wanted to go see her. Why? I don't really think she deserves that. I know she could have done better. It hurt me. Honestly, it got me, I was like, I've seen her such a long time. You know, we grew up together in a certain way. Why is she living in her car? I'm like, "Where do you live?" "Well, I'm in Santa Monica and then I was in Boston, Karo." And it was kind of weird, man. I didn't like to see that because, you know, she was like a little sister. Looking at her, you know, she was overweight. She was chunky, and her mind wasn't right. So what got you interested in fighting again? I promised myself I would only take a year off. So I kind of justified to myself that whole time that, like, oh, I wasn't, you know, I was just getting everything out of my system. I didn't really get to do the high school thing. I dropped out of high school sophomore year. I didn't go to college, so I felt like I needed to get it all out. She was drinking every day. She was all wasted and she didn't want to work out anymore. I would see, like, a bunch of clothes, I'm like, "Ronda, are you living in your car?" She was like, "Yeah, dude", my fucking window doesn't even go down. I'm getting... - "It's hot and all that stuff." - Her name is Fonda. Fonda is Ronda's Honda. I named her that so you could say that. The change was she said, "I wanna fight." - MMA? - MMA. And I told her, "Didn't I tell you you have a pretty face", you don't wanna mess it up?" She goes, "No, Manny. No, I'll fight." So I took her with me to this gym which is called Main Event. No one asks, "Who is this girl?" They didn't care who she was. Day by day, she grew and she got better and then they still didn't care and then she said, "I want to fight amateur." Then I had to move from Main Event to GFC at Edmonds. And I was asking around... where I could go to do striking, and I went to a couple places and it didn't really fit well. I'd gone to, like, three different places already and I was asking the guys at the Hayastan where they were doing their striking, and Manny and Karo and Savat were all, at the time, were training at GFC. And so, Manny invited me to come with them one day, and so I did. When Ronda came, I didn't wanna train her. You know, I was like, "Judo is a great sport, it's a beautiful art." And maybe she should continue on spreading the knowledge which she's learned and how she made it to the Olympic games and raised the US flag, and, you know, why fight, and what is she gonna do with fighting? Is she gonna be able to support herself? Because this is a serious sport. I don't want you to get in there and train and not be able to make a living with it. Yeah, Edmond would barely even said two words to me, I think, for the for the first few months I was there. - What made you change your mind? - Her work ethics, you know. I like it when people come and they don't give up and they want to get that attention and they workout hard so they can really earn that respect and, you know, make sure that their coach understands that they really wanna do it, so they put in the time and effort because it's not only about talent. It's about work ethics. She was there almost every day on time and she was training hard as she can and she was trying to get improved, and then we realized that she was something. I believe it the day I... She start training with me. I told her always. I said she's gonna be champion. Her ups and downs made her who she is. Tough times don't last. Tough people do. That's what she is. So how did you feel about her getting into mixed martial arts? Well, I thought it was a really bad idea... for several reasons. I said, "You know, you're really smart." You always have done outstandingly well in math and science. Let the stupid people punch each other in the face. You know, go to medical school. Get a PhD in oceanography. Go do something "that has a high probability of being successful." I was trying to get the world to accept the men fighting in a cage and, you know, you could get the mount and punch somebody when they were down, you know. We grew up here in the United States in a culture where you don't hit a man when he's down, you know? Like the old John Wayne movies, he'd hit somebody and he'd go over and stand him back up and he'd hit him again, right? We couldn't wrap our brains around people being on top of each other, hitting a person when they're down, - let alone a woman. - I didn't want her to do MMA because I don't want some people punching, you know, especially girls, to punch in a pretty face. I said, "I'm gonna ask your mom." If your mom allowed it, then I will do it." And I've known Gokor many, many years, and I said, "Let me ask you this. If you had a daughter, would you let her do it?" And he said, "I get your point, you know", I won't bring it up again." But Ronda, of course, had different ideas. So Ronda, with a mind of her own, entered the male-dominated world of MMA. I think that your coaches should love you and care about you, and I was in... I kind of had that mentality where I wanted to go and train where the best people were. Where when I switched sports to MMA, I was like, "You know, I'm going to train" where the people who actually love and care about me are, "and then I'll find a way to make it work there." And, um, so I've known Gokor since I was a little tiny kid, and he was the only person I knew that was in MMA and so I came up to him and I was like, "You know what, I trust you, I wanna do this." Anything that you recommend, "I'm 100 percent committed from now on." And I don't want to take only credit. My students here trained her a lot. Karen, Karo and Manny. So my school trained her. I expected when I started that I was gonna do really well. I mean, I saw the level of athlete those girls were, and I came from the Olympics. I knew that women's MMA was just starting to develop and it wasn't at Olympic-sport level yet. I think there was, like, some interview I did somewhere, like, the first time I walked into Eddy's striking gym and put a boxing glove on for the first time. And I just... they said, "So, what are you doing MMA for?" I'm like, "Oh, I'm gonna win the world championships." I'm pretty proud and make it look easy too." I said something really cocky. I remember that got onto YouTube or something. Just people were really, really mean about it, you know? In judo, I was used to the crowds always booing me and the press always being very positive and the feedback was being very positive, and in MMA, everybody cheers for me, but... the press and the feedback I get is not always so positive. Why? What kind of stuff were they saying? Well, people were saying that I was delusional and that was stupid what I was saying. - They couldn't wait to see... - Early days? Yeah, they couldn't wait to see me get my ass kicked and all that stuff. The first time that Ronda Rousey ever walked up to me and said, "Hi," I had no idea who she was. She said, "I'm Ronda Rousey. I fight in mixed martial arts" and I'm gonna be in the UFC someday." - I said, "Nice to meet you." "Nice to meet you." After Ronda's second amateur fight, I was invited along to join the team to help her with her striking for a few months. Actually, I think you were there probably the first week she was in MMA. What I'd do if I were you is buy a couple of these bandages here. You don't need to use so much bandage. No, that's disposable and it costs money and I can't even pay to fix the windows on my Honda. I can't pay for them. If I buy them, would you use them? Yes, of course I will. I'm a woman. Anything free, I'll take it. While he's teaching you boxing, how to boxer, and the boxing part side, your legs are a little different. You know, when you're mixed martial artist, we're gonna fix... We're gonna work on the legs. Just don't worry about the legs right now. Go exactly what he say and you're at the most... Your hands is the most important. Then we'll work on the legs, how the legs gonna be. Okay? Give me a slow jab. Again. Maybe put your legs out, please. Every once in a while, you'll find a jock, an athlete that works harder than anybody else. She'll work maybe two, three times a day, like you're the first real boxing coach she ever had and she learned a lot from you. If she get the... Her striking get there, I don't think so anybody can stop her. Her grappling today, I don't think so any jujitsu girls or any other girls in the world can stop her. And she's considerate of people. She had a pro wrestler that she liked. His name was Rowdy. She says, "What do I do? I want to use the name Rowdy." I says, "I'll talk to my buddy, Rowdy Roddy Piper." So I talked to him and he's laughing. He said, "She can use any name she wants." You must be pretty proud of her using that one now, huh? I'm proud of her. Roddy Piper's proud of her. Twenty-three years old. Ronda Rowdy Rousey, as we said. The team headed to Las Vegas for her second amateur fight with a brand-new name, Rowdy Ronda Rousey was born. She's tough... but look at this. Rousey scrambles to mount, you see the punches come immediately. Slips out to the arm bar. Beautiful transition. Autumn Richardson holding onto her arm for dear life. At this point, her opponents seemed secondary. Her vision was much bigger, the UFC. How long do you think it's gonna be until you say, "You know what, I'm ready to go pro." Till I go pro? Hopefully as soon as possible. It doesn't matter how good striker she is or whatever she is on that part. She's always going to use her judo, and if her judo is not good enough, she's gonna lose it. ♪ She's like a heart attack ♪ ♪ She's like a heart attack ♪ How's the girl's striking? The other girl? She's very good. The other girl is outstanding. She's probably the second-best person in the ring. I'm not prejudiced. It's a real challenge getting fights for her because people, they find out about her and they generally don't want her. Do you think the girl's underestimated her? I think when somebody's six and 0, they start to overestimate themselves. ♪ She's so fine forgot... ♪ With two wins now under her belt, the Rousey name was spreading throughout the MMA world. Fights were getting harder to get. It was time to step up in class, Las Vegas, The Venue. Ronda would take on an unbeaten Taylor Stratford with a perfect record, six and 0. This would be her last amateur fight. Rousey with an early bound, and she does not wanna be in that position. There's the arm bar and there it is! ♪ She's like a heart attack ♪ ♪ She's like a heart attack ♪ Honestly, how long is it gonna be until you go pro? Actually, my first pro fight is February 26, next month. Oh, hold it, hold it. Right there. Now, twist it. Twist it and straight out. Straight out. If I rotate, then you rotate with me. Once you hurt her... Now, if you make the mistake and put your head on this side, - you can cut up your eye. - Okay. Okay, now, put your head down. Real slow. When I was doing grappling in amateur in judo I had a chance of going out on a date, I didn't do it. I went to the gym. And I spent eight hours a day in the gym and I did all the different martial arts, boxing, wrestling, judo, kenpo, Shudokan, taekwondo, all of 'em. You take the best features of all of 'em and see what works for you and that's what Rowdy Ronda does. - I don't wanna hurt you. - And I wanna live. She's got a very crazy attitude. One from here. Then throw. And here. And whatever she does, she wants to be the best. You run, she wants to beat you. Make sure you do that. You punch, she wants to punch harder. She's gonna be the next champion of the world. Otherwise I'll burn your house down. That's okay. I don't have a house. I'm broke. I'm a starving athlete. I don't got no house. When I first met her, she was a little disheveled and her hair was messy, and her cheeks were rosy from the training and she's a little bit heavier, but I saw this beautiful face and these dimples and this, you know, beautiful cheekbones and so I started trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I set up a photoshoot. I was trying to really figure out a way to cross her over to the mainstream, and not sexualize her, but show the dichotomy of this person that can crush and then this other beautiful woman. That's why I think people are so fascinated with her. You know how I feel. It's just utter bullshit. I sit here and smile and yeah, then I'd poke in his ear. I'm like, you better tell them this, this, and this, and I'm going to sit here and look nice. While he goes and just yells - everything I told him to say. - That's awesome. Her opponent's four pounds up. Ronda's been suffering like a fucking pro. So according to my scale and Darin's scale, I'm fine. So... But I really shouldn't have to worry about it now since she's overweight. So, who cares? It's just so funny. Like, when I did judo, if you were over by, like, 0.05 of a kilogram, you were sent home, like, and you were fined thousands of dollars for, like, going to, you know, Belgium or wherever on... Like, I missed weight once and they were gonna fine me thousands of dollars. I make my fighters lose weight. I make 'em lose weight because they represent me. She's representing you. - Makes you look bad. - There's a sauna here. Is it like it's physically impossible for her to sit in the sauna for an hour? That's a lie. It's inexcusable, you know. She can't lose another two pounds? Why didn't you tell us? Why not yesterday? Why did you not tell us yesterday? Every minute they go dehydrated is a disadvantage for us. I don't know. I really don't know what we're gonna do. You guys did sign contracts today to fight in earnest. That means you're to fight, not run away from your opponent. Does anybody have their paperwork ready for me? - Towel? She needs a towel? - Are you ready? Ronda's up first. Ronda cleverly pretended that she had weight issues. What she really was doing was hiding nine stitches in her foot from a dog bite. All right. Stand still. 146.2. No sense in being paranoid. The date was set for Ronda's professional debut. It would be March 27 at the Braemar Country Club in Tarzana, California. Her opponent, Ediane Gomes. Four pounds overweight and a six and one record. Gomes is... She was a tough girl. Ronda came out there and just dominated every second. She was completely offensive in everything she did and made Gomes completely defensive in everything that was occurring. No offense. She threw one punch that missed and from that point, ends up getting arm barred about 25 seconds into the first round. And that was the end of the fight. Ronda, you're awesome! - Love you. Wow! Now, that's tough. The best in the world. Nobody can touch her. Nobody will. I'm going on this record. Nobody in the world can touch Ronda. Cyborg, we're coming after you. You can't do it. She'll arm bar you in ten seconds. If she doesn't lay some whoop-ass on this gal, I'm gonna do like I did when she was a baby. I'm gonna turn her over on my knee and paddle her butt. I'll tell her that before the fight and I know that she'll annihilate, mutilate, assassinate her opponent. Two of the most accomplished fighters we've ever seen here at the Hard Knocks Fighting Championship. These may be some of the best bouts we may ever see. Charmaine Tweet was the second professional opponent to fall victim to Ronda's superior judo and grappling skills. Instead gets herself to the mount and now looks for an arm bar. And she's got it! Five fights. Five straight wins, all by her mother's signature arm bar. The UFC now firmly in Ronda's sights. Goodness gracious! Ronda finally invited Pete and I over to her beautiful home. In essence, we were just saying goodbye to her palace in Venice. Yeah. Here he is. I was wondering where you was at. Do you want a tour of my house? This is my dining room that we skipped for a reason. Someone kicked me, okay. People eat here apparently. I don't know how we haven't come up with a new strain of cholera or something. I wrote a note to... describe the personality of our kitchen. Right there. "I don't know what our garbage disposal must think of us." They're tearing this house down, in, like... Right after we move out. So as soon as we found out, we were just, like... "Well, who gives a shit, they're tearing down the house." So we just kinda want it, let it all go to hell. But it was already, kind of, hellish when I moved in. You know, I didn't make it like this. You know, when you guys were coming up today, you called me right when you pulled up, and you're like, "We think we're at the wrong address. There's no way you could possibly live here." All my underwear looks like... Mochi, when I first got my dog, she was obsessed with chewing up my dirty underwear and, like, I would wake up next to her in the morning, and be like, "Oh, my God," she would, like, throw up underwear, like, she would swallow it whole. Like, she was obsessed with it and she'd gnaw on it and that underwear that I just kicked out of the way just now is one of the many, many, many pairs I call workout underwear now, that make it look like I was just systematically raised by a group of wolverines over time, but that's not really what happened. And this stuff's awesome. We have aloe all over the place. It's really good for any kind of, like, - skin irritation that you have. - Awesome! Yeah. Any time like after, like, sparring or grappling or whatever or if I have rub burn and if anyone scratched me with Velcro, I use it. Just break it off and rub it in. I'm, like, moving the big stuff today, and I... Yeah, I'm really excited. We're moving to on the beach in Venice. I just have too much stuff and not enough room. This is a small room. So usually we just have stuff everywhere, and I, like, walk into the room in this corner and I'll just hop up on bed and this is where I sleep, you know. It's like I sleep in my storage room. Oh, yeah. Those are all my boarding passes from different places I went while doing judo. I put em' here 'cause I traveled a lot not 'cause I was loaded. This is my mama right after she won the world championships in Vienna, Austria, and she said she did cartwheels across the whole stadium. Awesome. This is my... my dad with my sister... and I. I'm the fat... I'm the little fatty. Fat bald one. That's Jennifer, and that's a big box of naked. That's why it's under all this stuff. I'm so... now I know what my ass looks like in a picture. Awesome! I never had people take pictures of like my bare ass or like my titties. You're not gonna find that on the internet and I can never let any, like, you know, boyfriend, "Oh baby, I swear, I swear, I swear I'll never show anybody." I was always like, "Fuck you and fuck that. Not happening." So that's the first time I really got to see my ass. You know, like, not in, you know, like in the Mandalay Bay, like crazy mirror in the bathroom. You're like... look at all the angles, you know what I mean? Like... The need to impress other people with stuff was never, like, a thing in our family ever. Like no one even talked about it. So that's what gives me a hard time a lot of time, where I'll go spend, like, a bunch of money on some boot, you know, and then I'll throw it in a box with a... I got to show you, like, this one box. This one box that is... probably needs insurance. And it is a box of boots. This is from... It was like my first big photoshoot thing and it was the Vogue Shape issue before the 2008 Olympics. I'm a natural blond but, like, the sun dyes it, you know. Like, if you wear it up all the time or like all this different stuff. Like different parts see the sunlight, so it brightens unevenly. I get it highlighted to even it out, not to be blonder than I really am, okay? This is real. Real. I'm at Ronda Rousey's old house, and you know, to... I'm here shooting a documentary about Ronda and she put me and Tyler to work moving her. As you can see there was furniture here and then now it's empty. All you see is the dog and all the furniture here was moved by me and I would say, I couldn't shoot any documentary -unless I was put to work. - That was the condition. - That was the condition, - but she thanked me. - Yeah, me too. That's what you got to do. He's a good sport. Yeah. So we're showing the transfer of success from these humble beginnings to the new house, which you'll see us at... - shortly. - Yep. And they surely earned the right to show you. I used to have this little Christmas tree ornament that hung from the ceiling and I boxed with it and we had the... One of our couch people, silent Jessie, just decided to get his six-foot, eighty-pound ass in a rage one day and just hit it and hit it on something else and broke it. He broke my boxing ornament. So we're taking the hooks, we're taking the plant. This house is motherfucking safe. 'Cause look at me and look at that dog and look at that gate. I haven't achieved anything. Remember I was telling you? You have control and this one goes under, here, here, and squeeze it. Up right over left elbow. Right over left elbow. Like this. - Oh, so... - Watch. Let's begin. Hugs for Gary. Against Julie Ketzie after winning the first four fights of her career. And as we mentioned, Ronda Rousey, two submission wins. My first Strikeforce fight. I did like the coolest arm bar that ever happened, that I never practiced. I jumped in the air and did this crazy thing, and then the girl was like putting her arm out to catch herself. And, like, she was really cool to me beforehand, and I could feel her arm popping out. And I knew the second that her hand touched the ground that the weight of everything stopping would just totally blow out her elbow and she was yelling, "Tap, tap, tap, tap!" So then I stopped and she got up and was like, "I didn't tap, I didn't tap. I didn't tap." - Oh, no! - And then after that, I was like, I'm making an example out of everyone forever, because I was like, you ruined my Strikeforce debut and the coolest move ever, so everyone else is gonna get it. If I feel sorry for you in the ring... - No, I'm not saying that. - I'm gonna end up being the loser. Don't fight with me. Don't argue with me. I have been taught by my teachers, who were all champions, and the reason they were champions, if they had a guy on the ropes... they'd finish him off. - Sure. - Not say, "Okay, come on out," here's my chin." As Ronda is great with arm bars and you leave an arm over there, she's gonna catch it. And Ronda will punish you. When I'm coaching somebody and I have to go to the bathroom or something, I can't wait 'til the second round. So I tell my niece, Rowdy Ronda Rousey... "See this watch?" It doesn't go to the second round. "It's the first round." So in nine fights, three amateur... six pros, none of them... have gone to the second round. Ronda Rousey wants an even more clean-cut victory here tonight against Julia Budd. By this time, Ronda not only wanted to win... she really wanted to make a statement in which way she did it. Referee Kim Winslow, and immediately, Ronda Rousey closes the distance on Julia Budd. This is the round of Ronda Rousey. - And going for it. - And already going for the arm bar! Belly down arm bar here! It would take her seventh opponent, Julia Budd, to underline. Rousey was ready for the big-time. A record four win, four arm bars, four first-round finishes! There's "Judo" Gene LeBell, one of the greatest grapplers in American history, and he had his stopwatch out. My grandfather was one of the toughest league players. He always tell everybody, he said, "Be nice to hurt your opponent." If you... They don't tap first time, "the second, you don't give no chance." Now he's got it. Look at it! My God, that was quick! The crowd is going wild, ladies and gentlemen. They have to know you like that. Have you ever, ever really hurt someone and... - felt bad about it? - If I hurt somebody... there's a reason behind it. No, I can't honestly say that I've felt bad about hurting somebody. I might have felt bad years ago, but I got Alzheimer's and dementia and I can't remember feeling sorry for somebody that I hurt. It's sort of a sexual release when I do something to somebody. Do you have the same feeling? - No, Gene. - Oh. So this Miesha Tate champion, she was, I don't know, the Strikeforce or... I don't know which one it was. She was a champ. And she wanted Ronda to come down to 135. Ronda's a world champion judoka. Let me just mention she's a world champion judoka, which means a judo practitioner. And this chick wants her to come... Oh, which I understand her point of view, Miesha Tate. This is MMA, this isn't judo. Come down to 135 and I'll take the fucking challenge. She takes the challenge. She accepts it. Okay, 135, I'll come down and I'll fight you. Once Ronda says I'll take the fight at 135, this chick says, "Well, no, no, no," you're not worthy to fight me yet. I'm the champ. What kind of bullshit is that? She wished for it. You be careful what you wish for, 'cause it just might come true, and it did. She got her fuckin' arm broken... humiliated on fuckin' TV, and Ronda was the champion. Ronda said it politely that she's greatly motivated by spite. You know, when you saw her and Miesha Tate, that was not fake. Ronda genuinely didn't like her. - And... - Why? Well, because Miesha said some things about her that she thought - were uncalled for and I think... - Said she didn't deserve a shot. Yeah. That kind of stuff. Like, who do you think you are? I was in the Olympics at 16 and you were putting on a singlet to go fight, you know, wrestle boys in high school. When she was getting ready to fight Miesha Tate, this is a true story. When I tweeted, I said, "You know,". Ronda is at a different level. She's a different animal. I'm not saying it because she's my friend, "it's the truth." She goes, "I can't see that, Manny." You never rode me, "you never respond or anything like that." I'm like, "No disrespect to you. I will support you." I think you're a great fighter. You've got the heart of a lion. But I've known her for so many years. When I was doing judo with her, I was kicking her ass. She was crying. I threw her, she was crying and she was coming back at me. I grappled with her. I choked her out. I'd do arm bar triangle, she cries and she comes back at me. She's a bitch on the mat. She'll hurt you. "She doesn't care." But that's what make her the best. As Ronda exploded into the world stage of women's MMA, tensions mounted. At the weigh-in against Miesha Tate, a headbutt would clearly show to all that watched that Ronda certainly beats to the rhythm of her own drum. Her father had spoken her into existence, and she certainly started to fill them shoes. Her father, her late dad, always knew that she was destined for something special. You ready? Let's fight! Referee Mark Matheny calls for the bell. We are underway, and immediately Miesha Tate comes out swinging. Miesha Tate with the first strike, and the takedown by Rousey. Backs up the challenger. There's that judo hip toss by Rousey. Lookin' for the arm again, here she goes. And again now transitioning to the arm. Less than a minute remaining in the first round. If he doesn't tap in the first, second you have to break him. Tate hanging on, desperately trying to survive. Ow, she's gonna break it. It's over! Rowdy Ronda Rousey. Five professional fights! Five first-round arm bar submissions! Ronda Rousey is the new Strikeforce women's bantam weight champion! I know that you wanted to dedicate this to your father. Congratulations on an amazing victory. She dedi... I get choked up. She dedicates her wins to her father and that can make me really cry. It's respect. I just want to say thank you to all my coaches, my teammates, my family, and most of all, to my dad, wherever you are. I hope that you see this. We all miss you. We love you and this is for you. I hope you're proud of me. This gal that's unbelievable as a person. A lot of people are champions in different sports, but this lady has a heart of gold. How did you find out what happened with your dad? You know, it's funny, most of the conversations that my mom and I have actually had have been in the car, in the van, driving me to judo. And I remember when she actually told me the whole story about how his back was actually giving out and how he made his decision. She told me in the car, driving on the way to judo. And how did you respond? You know, I... I didn't... At that point, he died years ago, by the time she told me, like, kind of... And all the details of it. So I guess... at the time, it's... What's the word? I just kind of didn't really react and I wanted to go fight instead. And that was my reaction and I was... Would go to judo that night and I felt better afterward. So I don't remember saying anything or, you know, having a huge reaction. Just... I trained really hard that night and I didn't think about it the next day. And how about now? Do you ever think about him when you train, before fights or... I think I think about him the most, like, after I accomplish something big because, um, I just... I think that he would be, like, the most excited person about it. Ronda was now set to defend her Strikeforce title against Sara Kaufman. My name's Diana Prazak. Lucia Rijker is my trainer, and as of the last year, we've been sparring with Ronda. First we're preparing her, helping her striking for her Sarah Kaufman fight. Immense hair preparation before you spar. No, just a French braid. - A French braid. - It's Valentine's Day, so I wanted it to be pretty. She's good. She's just naturally gifted. She has great instincts. She has a good trainer. She follows direction very well. She works out like a true pro. I love it. I have so much fun sparring her. You know, it's always a... It's a pleasure. ♪ Everybody chokes ♪ ♪ When they see someone Cut down in their prime ♪ ♪ It may not show When you look at me ♪ ♪ But I know I'm in mine ♪ ♪ I'm potent, baby, I'm potent Dangerous to the naked eye ♪ So how has Ronda's striking improved? Oh, well, her combinations, her speed, and her confidence in her arms, her confidence in striking ability. She's known obviously for the arm bar. That's her key move, and she's known for doing that all the time. She can hold it when it comes to striking now as well. Yeah, I give her all the credit in the world. She has an animal instinct that helps her to have a laser focus. She pushes her will on to her... Most of her opponents, which is kinda the animal kingdom, it's what an animal does. And she backs it up by hard training and natural talent and good people around her. Angle up! Ronda's victory over Sarah Kaufman at the Valley View Casino in California would be her last fight before entering the UFC. And it's over! Rowdy Ronda Rousey continues to amaze me! Ronda was like this tornado that came in there and just destroyed people. And so she made you take notice. Dana White said there will never be a woman in the UFC. When are we gonna see women in the UFC, man? - Never! - Anytime soon? - Never? - Never. And Ronda changed that. Made him eat his words! What about the future of women in your sport? Ronda. Ronda Rousey. She just changed the entire face of women's MMA. Ronda destroyed Miesha's arm in that Strikeforce fight, and it made Dana take notice and then he met Ronda. He saw something in her and that... The same thing that most people see in her: She's different. And she's just a different animal. She came up to me at an event once, and she said, "Can I talk to you?" and I said, "Yeah, so we went back" into my room in the arena. And then I had known a lot more about women's MMA, and we talked for about 45 minutes. And 15 minutes into the conversation, in my head I was going, "Holy shit." "I think I'm gonna do this, and I actually think that this is the woman to do it with." I'm gonna make it official right now. The first-ever UFC women's champion, Ronda Rousey. And I'm presenting her with her belt. People lost their minds... when I made her and Liz Carmouche the main event. "This is disgusting." "What the fuck kind of bullshit is this?" "This is a joke." These are fans and, um, some media too. February 23 at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California, she'll be fighting Liz Carmouche, and she is the main event. The amount of pressure is what impressed me so much about the way she handled that entire situation. Because, you know, she had been handed a belt, really, and you know, to come in and be in the position where you've never even fought for a promotion, never fought for an organization, and now you're the champion of it, and you are the main event for that organization. The amount of pressure, most people will never understand what that's like. Nobody in the history of this company will have more new media following them than Ronda Rousey will. Ronda Rousey has broken the gender barrier in the UFC. Less than two years after UFC President Dana White said women would never compete in the UFC, Rousey will reportedly become the first female fighter to join the organization. When you're fighting in mixed martial arts... there are actually things you're not allowed to do. Sometimes, if you're watching it you feel like both opponents can really much try anything, but that's not the case. No, no. You can't, like... There's no, like, eye gouging. You can't, like, tickle the other person. There's no... You can't scratch 'em. - You can't pull their hair. - Wait a minute. You can't tickle the other person? Thank God! I'm actually deathly ticklish, but... And you can't open-hand slap them, which I thought would be awesome to just walk out there and slap a girl but apparently the only reason why you can't is because you might poke 'em in the eye. And Carmouche, Have you ever fought her before? No, I haven't, but she's like a veteran marine. I know. I was reading about that. She's no slouch. This chick is like, you know, she's coming to throw down. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the main event of the evening! When Liz Carmouche and Ronda Rousey walked out into that arena, that place went fucking nuts. The energy in the crowd was as big as any big fight you've ever been to. The champion and the challenger. This would be a defining moment in women's sport. Rousey would face Liz Carmouche as the first woman ever to enter the octagon in the UFC. Ronda, you know, went out there, made a couple mistakes. Liz got into a... you know, a good position, got her back. Carmouche is on her back though, Mike. Carmouche has it over on her. Carmouche has... Ronda's face is getting twisted sideways. Carmouche's trying to shock the world. Liz actually had her in a very painful, if you want to say it, face crank that started to actually put a little bit of, you know, concern on Ronda. You could see her start to have, you know, that little bit where we start to panic. And you could see her collect herself and just basically go, "I'm gonna be fine." Good shot here, Mike! Rousey trying to shake and she does! Oh, now this is bad. This is the arm bar position. Rousey more pressure. She's locking it. Ronda proved the naysayers wrong and Dana White right. She had now paved the way for women in the UFC. It's for the champion, Ronda Rousey. She goes up and faces the best in the world. They know exactly what she's gonna do and how she's gonna beat 'em, but they can't stop her. She's unbelievable and she gets better every time she fights. I'm a bit more of a believer in women's MMA now. If a guy is good, but he doesn't have any heart... I don't wanna waste my time. Ronda has heart. She's got brains. She's got beauty and she's got it all. She's got the whole package. I think Ronda is just smarter than every single person out there and she will never give up. I remember this one time I was at this great restaurant in Chicago and two Notre Dame basketball players came up to me and they were huge, and they were like, "Hey, he's arguing with me. He thinks he could kick Ronda Rousey's ass." And I told him "Ronda Rousey would drop you on your head" in two seconds before you even knew what happened." "No way." And it just became this thing where, you know, women rallied behind her. Men were, like, totally in love with her or just blown away by how badass she was. Ronda is like a man with a vagina. She looks at the world like a man. She looks at fighting like a man. She fights men. She trains with men. She's not this... She's a girlie-girl when she wants to dress up and stuff like that, but she doesn't go through her athletic life like a lot of girls do. She goes through it like a man does. What are you more afraid of, losing a fight or getting hurt? Oh, I'm way more afraid of losing a fight. I'd rather get hurt badly and win, than lose unscathed. It's natural. Nerves are natural. Even being afraid is natural. You can be afraid. If you're afraid like a bitch, well, excuse my French, you're in the wrong business. You can have nerves. You can have those butterflies, but I've always said, get them to fly in a formation, control them as much as you can. Make friends with the loss. I make friends with it... to calm me down, get that knot to release in my stomach, but I don't wanna lose. I'm not gonna get there to lose. That just relaxes your nerves until you get in the cage. It's a preparation, it's like, I had to beat my own fundamental darkness first before I enter the ring which is my doubt. So I'd start with that, the moment you sign a contract. I'd start working with my inner destructive self. And the moment I had overcome her, I could face my opponent. As a normal human being, we all have that bit of fear in us that's very motivating. And if you don't, you're probably a sociopath of some sort. For some athletes, that fear, especially that fear of failing, you know, especially in an individual combative sport where you're standing out in that cage all by yourself. There isn't anybody else you're gonna point to and blame and say, "Well, he dropped the ball," or "He missed the catch." It's just you. You have to learn to deal with that and embrace that fear, use it to motivate you to do the things you need to do to make sure you don't lose. Her brand exploding. Along with the good press also came the haters. But anyone in the entertainment business knows, write whatever you wish, just make sure you spell my name right. Hollywood jumped onto the Rousey bandwagon and her movie career added to her now outrageous schedule. Dana White and the UFC chose the perfect opponent to feed the drama. So a rematch was made with her arch rival, Miesha Tate. When she was out shooting Expendables, what happened was she was there shooting for two months. She was running a bit, you know, going to the gym, hitting the bag, but she didn't work the way she was supposed to. And that two months of every day shooting, keeping her weight low, Ronda got sick. And when she came back, she had Fast and the Furious then flew back here. We had 45 days to prepare her for the Miesha Tate second fight. Miesha paid greatly for the insults she allegedly made toward Ronda's family. Ronda's mother had told me her daughter was greatly motivated by spite. And Ronda Rousey remains the UFC women's bantamweight champion. It was for this reason. Ronda refused to shake Miesha's hands. She went to shake Ronda's hand and Ronda walked away from her. Well, first of all, I need... I need to commend and congratulate Miesha. She is an amazing fighter. She really is. It's just, once you insult my family, I can't shake your hand, but I really respect her and I... I think she did an amazing job tonight. I think that a lot of the world likes to see Ronda as like this like cocky, which really... she's not cocky, she's confident. Somewhat angry. Somewhat just like, "I'm gonna go out there and beat the shit out of you" mentality. But to me, Ronda's one of the greatest human beings I've ever met. She has a heart of gold. Like, she will be there for anybody. She was the same in 2010 when we met her. She had those same qualities of that bone to pick, that outspokenness. She never changed since I've known her. That's what makes her so special. A lot of people say she has a bitchy attitude and this and that. I overhear all this stuff, but I know her for too long, you know. I know what's in here. In here, there's a little, pure, white girl who has a big heart. If she loves someone, she will do almost everything for them. I lift the leg up and she's still in my bounds, okay? So I want you to think about putting all the weight on one leg. Try again. Pushing on her head. So, jab, swoop, set to the 45-degree angle. I'm looking at the 45. We're here. So Ronda and her friend came up with... She came up with the idea and a percent of all this goes to breast cancer research. She actually donated, like the fee they would give her to breast cancer research. She does a lot of stuff she doesn't get credit for. All right. She does a lot of stuff that nobody sees. You know... she is not one of those people that kind of is there for the photo op. She supported a middle school soccer team, on buying their uniforms. We have an educational video game company. She pays for several schools that can't pay it. She's constantly, every fight, she, you know, auctions off her stuff and gives all the money to charity, and... I always thought that eating disorders were something that was really overlooked and something that's becoming an increasingly big problem. It's something that I suffered with when I was younger and, you know, being in a weight-division sport and, you know, a teenage girl, and people asking you what your weight is all the time is not really, you know, a way to develop a great self-esteem, and... and I thought that I was alone in it. I thought that there was something that was just wrong with me and I was suffering by myself, and I realized it was actually very, very common. And it just breaks my heart when I see, like, a little 11-, 12-year-old girls come up to me and tell me they think they look fat or something like that. And I think that's just terrible, and so, we came up with the logo "Don't Throw Up, Throw Down," - and... - Oh, wow. Yeah, cute, huh? Now back to the hurt business. Rousey, McMann. Here we go! But you don't tell the wrestler... Against Sara McMann, Ronda demonstrated her versatility, and her first victory came without the use of the arm bar. Fastest knockout in women's bantamweight history. It is almost impossible to stop. - When you get hit... - I think the only way that she can get beat is if she took things too lightly. Like her old coach told her, Jim Pagos one time before the US Open, he'd say, you know, "Nobody's coming out to this tournament" and they're gonna lay down for you 'cause you're Ronda Rousey, "and you have to train, you have to earn it." And so, I'll go and watch every now and then and see if I think that's she's training hard enough and if she is, then I don't really have... She knows what she's doing. It's funny. I like... I get so tired of being a tough girl sometimes. I would say "I just don't wanna be a tough girl anymore." I just wanna be... Things to work and be easy and just please. When you say you don't wanna be a tough girl all the time, what do you wanna be? You wanna be a little girl that someone takes care of? No, just when I'm home. When I'm out, I wanna go be tough girl. When I come home, I wanna be the three-legged kitty and just, you know, just sad, you know, because when I come home, I'm just dragging myself in through the door, I'm like,. You know? I don't wanna be tough when I'm home. That's my job when I'm away, and when I'm home, it's my time just to be weak. So let me ask you about boys. I mean, it must be tough when you date a chick who can knock you out, right? I mean, you're really pretty, you're feminine, and you're beautiful, I think you're quite funny. But when the shit hits the fan, you can knock most of your boyfriends out, so, so do men get insecure with you? Well, I think some would, but I think that just kinda helps me with the filter process. If anyone's insecure with being someone... With someone like me, they never ask me and I don't have to deal with insecure guys. She's gonna live to be the world's oldest virgin... - Her mother loves this story. Because she'll go out with any guy that could beat her. A lot of guys have tried. She's still a virgin. Gene LeBell. We'd finished training the other day and we were chatting about some stuff and he started coughing and I said, "Are you okay, Gene?" And he said, "I'm a little sick." And then he had one of them Gene LeBell moments, and he said... "I'm getting old." He said it in a way in which he meant it. And he said, "You know, the only thing keeping me alive is Ronda." And I said, "What?" He went, "Yeah, she's the only reason I'm alive right now." I have someone else to look forward to." - And so you should... - That's really sweet. Yeah, that's what he told me. And with working with you, right? I see how, you know, the way you train with such fire, such passion, it's... I know it's for yourself but I always feel that you... you're doing it for your team too. Yeah, well... I have daddy issues. I aim to please. Pretty much what my mom chalked it up to. She said that... I wanna make my coaches proud of me. You know, I actually, I care about... The people I respect, I care about their opinion a little bit too much and I respect all my coaches. Alexis, you are undoubtedly the most credentialed grappler that she has fought yet. Do you think that you're gonna be able to stop the arm bar and what then? Yeah, I definitely think I'm going to be able to stop the arm bar. And it's all over! Just like that! Rowdy. Ronda Rousey! The concept of not the champion, you know, there's people that wanna be champions... and then there's people that want to be the best, and there's people that wanna be the best ever, a legend, and that's what she wants to be. She wants to people to remember, "Oh, do you remember Ronda Rousey?" She changed the way that we look at women. She changed the way that women look at themselves, and she definitely changed the way little girls look at what's possible. You know, when I was growing up, little girls played over here and the boys played over here. She smashed that whole concept. For little girls, they realize now, women can do anything. If a woman can go in there and do what Ronda Rousey does, women can do anything. She's a very powerful figure for women, and I think she's a very powerful figure for men, and how we look at women now, you know. Because all these men are walking around going, "Oh man, she'll kick my ass. She'll kick my ass." I don't ever remember a scenario in the history of the world where a woman could kick a man's ass, or people believed that they could, until Ronda Rousey. She's like a fucking superhero now. Here we go! An extraordinary win against Cat Zingano in UFC 184, solidified Ronda's dominance in world sport. ESPN awarded her Fighter of the Year, beating legendary boxer Floyd Money Mayweather. Wow! Rowdy Ronda Rousey puts her undefeated career on the line against nine and 0 Bethe Correia. Bethe Correia really disrespected her at a weigh-in and said, "When I beat you", you're probably gonna commit suicide." This fight has become extremely personal to me and I've never wanted to beat someone so badly in my life. And I'm definitely not gonna finish her off quickly. I want to make sure that she remembers every second of that day. Ronda Rousey had become such a worldwide phenomenon that when she went to Brazil to fight Bethe Correia, she was cheered by the Brazilian fans who were normally fiercely loyal to their own fighters and athletes. At one point, they broke into chants of "Ronda, Ronda!" Rousey held an open workout in front of hundreds of admiring fans and later signed autographs on the beach. So much for Bethe Correia's hometown advantage. It's time! Bethe Correia! Ronda Rousey! Before she would wanna go clinch. Now when she's hitting them, they wanna clinch her and if you wanna clinch her, that's her game. After disrespecting Ronda, her father, and her family, Bethe Correia became the second opponent to learn a very painful lesson. - And it's all over! - Oh, my goodness. I just wanna say we lost a really close friend, Rowdy Roddy Piper, who gave me permission to use his name as a fighter, so I hope him and my dad had a good time watching this today. For someone in Ronda's position, with everything that's coming at her, and all the accolades, it's so hard for a young person to be grounded and understand what's important. And to understand, you know what, that's all great stuff, but those people are really not my friends. You know, I'm gonna keep my friends close and, you know, those are associates, and yeah, you know, I'll be nice to them. But these are the people I'm gonna trust. She's been very smart about it. She's grounded. She has her mom who she adores, and, you know, is very tough on her, but is honest with her. You know, I think she might do the fighting thing for a couple more years... and then get out because there's no long-term payoff of continually being punched in the face that, you know, no matter who you are, no matter how good you are, eventually you get old, or you get unlucky. I don't think she has a definite plan B. She has another possibility she's looking at, maybe opening a gym, but I don't see her being in that life for the long haul. At least, I hope not. I think at some point Ronda will probably have to make a choice 'cause it's hard to juggle both. If movies is just something she's doing for fun and she can do on the side, I mean, I did that for 11 years. I think if you asked her right now, she'd probably choose fighting over making another movie, - but that may change. - I don't know. What I see right now, I see more big things that come for her, movies and stuff. I don't know. Maybe she quit the fight. You never know. I want to... be able to beat all the girls that you could even mention as being competition for me and then I want to retire undefeated. And we were talking about the day that I'd probably be done and, like, he was saying, like, even after my fight, a couple days after the fight, I came and sat and just watched everybody train because I just wanted to be at the gym and then I would get so antsy just watching everybody that the next day I came and trained, and it's just that I like being there. And the day... When the day comes that I just don't feel like being there is the day that I'm going to stop. If someone thinks that Holly Holm can't beat Ronda, they don't understand fighting. Holly can beat Ronda but Ronda can definitely beat Holly, and it's who's gonna impose their will in their game. If Ronda went out to try to out-box Holly Holm, she's making a mistake and she can lose that fight. Ronda Rousey, I think, is dealing with this loss in the way that she deals with things. You know, Ronda is a different, special individual. That's why she is who she is, and that's why she became as big as she has become, and she's motivated by greatness. She wants to be seen as the best ever. She wanted to stay undefeated and now she wants to avenge her loss, win the title and beat all the girls that are looked at as, you know, probably the top three toughest girls in the world. It's coming to an end sooner or later. Exactly. I was talking about that with Ronda. It's a huge part of your life. It's gonna be like losing a child. What's gonna get you up in the morning after that? I always think about that, and you know, Abel Sanchez, I was up in Big Bear with Yeni Kolodkin. He said, "Edmond, you wanna hear something?" I said, "What?" "You're never gonna have a fighter like that, and you know what sucks?" I said, "What?" He said, "That you're young." I said, "Holy shit, I didn't think about that." And I know I don't have that giving up, you know, I'll never give up, but... I dunno if I could even say words, you know, that day when I'm gonna retire. I don't think I can speak about it. Ronda is just the best fighter in the world... to me. So if you were talking to the kids out there, what advice would you give them to say that, you know, no matter where you're from, you can also do this? You know, that's funny, I keep bringing up my mom's lines. But she used to have this... one that, "No one has the right to beat you." A lot of the other countries, they don't have better programs and multi-million dollar facilities and all this stuff. Like, she always put it in clear, she's like, "Look", the training opportunities you have are not what they have, but you can take what you have and you can make it just as effective as what they have. You just have to want it more. "And you can't give everybody else too much credit." But I don't know, I think that even if it looks like you don't have much, you can find a way. There's a way, there's a solution to every problem. Someone's got to be number one. Someone's got to be a doctor. There's no reason why not you. Four years ago, I believe she didn't have anything to eat. She was struggling. But she came up from zero to a hundred. If there was a movie, it couldn't have been written more perfectly the way everything has evolved, you know, in this beautiful, divine way. It's an amazing, amazing story. She is a big role model for everyone. She's so giving. So loving. Every time we see Ronda, it's a hug, a kiss, I love you. I've never seen anyone that wants to win the way she wants to win. She has this drive, more than I've ever seen a man ever strive to win or to succeed. She's unique in every way. If you make a... big hole, like this octagon size and throw her inside the hole and every day, she gonna get better and better and with no teacher, and nobody help her, because she's a hard trainer. She has no fear. She's a fighter. And so, my story, unlike Ronda's is coming to an end. We know one thing: The bond between a father and a daughter is a very, very special one. And love is the most powerful motivator of all. The future for Ronda may seem uncertain... but as the dust clears, a beautiful path is revealed. She has left her mark forever... for those to follow eternally grateful. It's been six years riding this beautiful adventure. Seems like yesterday when I first sat across from this kind and humble young lady. Her relentless drive to prove her father right and a mother ever present like a shadow through the storms and the rain. So let's go back to where this all started... a small room far away from the cares and uncertainty... for just one last question. So when you become world champion, which is going to be pretty soon... I think... Do you ever think about going back to that little pond... and... skipping one more rock? Actually, I've been planning a road trip up there. I wanna go up... I wanna go up Route 66, like, to, like, Chicago, and then I wanna go out and shoot over to North Dakota and I wanna visit his grave and go to our old house and hopefully find that same spot and... just to, kind of, see it. I haven't seen it since I was a little kid. We kind of just left the whole life there, and I haven't really been able to look at it again. And I feel like... if I actually do win a world title, I'll have... You know, 'cause my dad told me I'd win the Olympics and I'm really proud of what I've done, but I haven't actually won it. And... I feel like if I do win a world title, I'll have something to, kinda, bring back to him. So I wanna, like, leave something there, but I don't know what yet. I'll think of something. Yeah. But the one thing I know is I'll meet him again and we'll laugh and we'll sing and we'll dance in the rain. So I'll keep pressing forward being all I can be. And I know in my heart that my father... he's always with me. You can see. You see I'm holding here. Here, and you'll break his leg here. Very simple. Okay, just drop it down here. See here? And then come, come here. Come here with this now, right. - Look. - It looks like it too. You can only use this footage if it says Yin's name on it. Yeah. Cut. Yeah, do it. - It's the writer. - There we go. Online reset. So let me... - Okay. - And Damon's the composer. Yes. I am always the composer. How is New York City? So far, so good. We're gonna go get to see some titties. It's over. He figured it out, Yin. - It's over now. - That's it! Done, over. My career's over. Yeah, he knows the two chords now. Oh, no! Oh! No, no, don't change it.
