I want to breathe the air outside of this town. The world I don't know. Some place that understands. That doesn't doubt. Doesn't constrict. That sees me as I will it. Not as I am. Sees me as what I could become. Not what I would be. Whatever you're writing in there isn't going to help you out at Maths later. You've been revising? Yeah I did three hours yesterday... and I got one of them fancy revision timetables for my bedroom wall and everything. - Yeah? - No mate, have I fuck! Don't get violent, alright? Grace! Grace! Grace come back here. Don't walk away from me! Hurry up mate! - Alright boys! - Are you coming mate? Keep your voice down mate me Mam don't know I smoke! Well hello Sammy, Kai. He's upstairs, smoking. Craig! Alright Mam. Where you boys off to? We're just off to the library, Mrs. Megson. Oh well glad to see you boys are taking your exams seriously. Unlike my Craig. Alright Mam! Fuck's sake... I'm sorry about her boys she's had her claws out all morning. Do your best. See you later Mrs. Megson. What the fuck are you laughing at? - Boys? - Yes Megsy? What do you reckon we'll be doing in ten years' time? Well, I would imagine that Kai here is a millionaire, I'm gonna be an international playboy, naturally... and you, Megsy... you'll probably be wanking off stray dogs in the park for a packet of Quavers! Fuck off! Jesus! I'll tell you where I won't be in ten years boys. Where's that then? - Here. - Oh I'm with there man. You know, I'm gonna move in with my dad in London next year. Oh come on boys. It's not that bad around here. Oh man you're both just gonna leave me in this shit hole! Oh for fuck's sake boys! You'll be fine mate. I've got a maths A-Level in a couple of hours and the only equation I really know is... me equals... fucked! My dad said when I register to his place in London I'm gonna get a BMW or an Audi or some shit like that. -You don't need a car in London mate. -You never need a car but... What's going on here boys? Are you alright mate? - It came from the roof. - Right on the head. Here Megsy mate what is the probability of getting hit by a statistics textbook on a Thursday morning? I dunno why you're laughing mate. How do you mean? Your name's on the murder weapon! On the desk, top left corner it will be laid out for you there... and please just remember what we talked about today. Don't rush into it. Look at all the questions it won't be what you want to see. Don't panic take a moment and construct the vague layout before you write it out in full, alright? Any other questions? Well, that concludes our final lesson. Alright, you're on your own now guys. Ah, Caleb I have that form, I'll leave it in your pigeon. Ah, cheers. Sir? Kai. I just wanted to know if you'd... read my latest short story yet. I did. You didn't like it. No. No, it was well written. Honestly? It had no heart, Kai. I mean sure it's well-executed, but it's all surface-level stuff really and your characters, and the situations they find themselves in... it was all a bit manufactured, to me. Look don't be disheartened. Just play to your strengths. Write what you know about not what other people talk about. Yeah but sir people don't want to read what I know. People aren't gonna believe what you don't know. Do you want to be a better writer? It begins with that door. There is a whole world out there waiting to shit on you. Let it. Use it. Now go on. Go get shat on. Thanks sir. I got one for you boys would you rather... fuck a goat, and nobody know about it or not fuck a goat and everybody at school thinks you fucked it? -What the fuck? -Erm. I think I'd probably just fuck the goat out of pride to be honest. - Ah yeah of course you would mate. - Why's that? Sheep-shagging runs in the family doesn't it? Oh fuck off! Hey. What do you want? Nothing. I mean, I... I just wanted to say sorry. For what? I didn't mean to stare, earlier. -Are you okay? -I'm fine! Thanks. That's okay. I was wondering You alright mate? Shit yourself? You know I'm only joking, man. He's not bothering you, is he Grace? No. Nah. 'Course he's not. I missed you last night. You never showed up. Uh, yeah my mum, she... I had to stay in all night. What a bitch. Alright well I'll see you after your exam, yeah? I'm gonna... see ya. Kai? Never mind. Pens down. Stop writing. Hello chicken nugget. Show your findings with a 'Venn Diagram'. What the fuck is a 'Venn Diagram'? Fucking hell boys I barely even made it past page four me. We could steal Mr Hurt's dog and make a ransom video. A ransom video for a dog? Mate that's not even a leavers prank, that's just blackmail. Yeah but leavers pranks are always so tame. You know like handprints on a tree and that shit. Exactly. Hang on you're in favor of 'doggy ransom'? No I'm not in favor of 'doggy ransom', I'm saying we need to up the ante a bit. We could fill the chapel with water so when they open it at final assembly... pffft! Like a whole wave of... well like water comes out. Does anyone have any ideas like, anything intelligent? I wanna come back in ten years knowing that everyone's still talking about this, you know? We need to do something legendary. How about we release three piglets into the main school building. Piglets? Chang, I said something intelligent. No! We label them. - I'm listening. - How do we label them? One... two... ...and four. Fucking hell, Chang. That's not a bad idea. - I don't get it. - Neither. Well, they find pig one, two and four pretty quick then spend ages chasing shadows looking for pig number three... ...which doesn't exist. Okay this is mental. Any pranks that don't include farmyard animals or just animals in general? No one starts early enough. That's why all the pranks are shit, there's no planning. Well what do you suggest? We start now. What are you doing? What's it look like? What do we do with them? I don't know yet. Something legendary. Here you go mate. Why does she like him? Why does who like who? Hang on a minute boys. What? Party at Greg's place! -Nice! -Let's go! Oh whoa whoa are you sure about that mate? I mean yeah, of course! No I mean, are you sure about that shirt mate? What! I mean when your shirts are making your boys look bad it's just a bit inconsiderate to be honest with you mate. Fuck off, both of you! Are you... Fine alright, we'll stop over at mine on the way over. -I'm not going to your house. -Why? What? 'Cause I'm high as fuck, mate and... I mean look at Kai's eyes! Your dad's a copper. - Step-dad. - He's still a fucking copper though. Yeah and he's at work you wreck-head. - Kai, bro. - Alright, okay. We'll wait outside. Come on boys. Let's go celebrate my U grade! That's when you fucking cheer lads! Watch your step dickhead. Mrs. Bucktree. Buckers! I'm gonna go see what Sammy's doing. What up? Do you know how much trouble you'd be in if my husband was here? Hand it over. Hand what over, Mrs Bucktree? Craig! Give me the weed. Sammy? Yeah I'm coming mate. Buckers? Hello love, it's only me. Shift finished early. That bloke next door has parked in my space again. What's for dinner? I'm starving. Craig? What are you doing, son? I'm, I'm, just...cooling. - Cooling? - I'm, just cooling the meal, sir. Right. Right, I'm uh, gonna take a... ...shower. Nice one Buckers. Kai? My little Grace. Where you off? You're not leaving are you? No. Well what you up to then? I was... I was looking for you. Yeah I bet you were. Yo, man. The fuck happened to you? Where you been? Things just got really messed up at some point. Yeah mate, tell me about it. You know Dave took a shit in the fucking shower! Little fucking Dave! It's a mess. What things, man? Okay, uh, well why don't you fix 'em? Fear. - What? - Because I'm scared, okay man? Whoa, alright, bro. - Why did you come out here? - To try and make you feel better. Yeah well you're just making things worse. -You're such a fucking downer. -Oh fuck off Sammy! What's your problem? Huh? We're all scared you, dick. - What do you have to be scared about? - Are you fucking serious? Of getting stuck here! You know it's alright for you isn't it? You can get out, you can go to uni, you can move on. I am fucked mate! I am the idiot that isn't qualified to do much more than drive a fucking milk cart around this nothing town. But while you are out there living your life, writing or... whatever! I am going to be stuck right here. What are you talking about you're going to London. My dad didn't care about me seventeen years ago when he left. Why the fuck would he give a shit now? What? I lied, man. I lied. We're seventeen. We've got three days left of school, ever and we're at a great fucking party. This is supposed to be the time of our lives man. I have been waiting for this fuck, we have been waiting for this for as long as I can remember the start of a summer we will never forget! This is bigger than you! So just grow a pair and fix it, okay, whatever the fuck it is! This is bullshit! Um, have you guys seen Grace? Wait! Get the fuck off her! Kai! No. What are you doing? - I thought he was hurting you. - I was. - You fucking... - Kenner No! Stop! Hi. Hey. Umm. I'm really sorry about... It's okay. What the fuck? There's a coldness in conflict. Direct and obvious. And wants become needs. And likes become loves. Choice, becomes loss. And loss, regret. How to choose, when once the choice is made? The latter will linger. An ever-burning glimmer in the mind, only to be extinguished by time itself. And time decides. Kai! Where have you been? Do you know what time it is? I was about to call the police. No one has seen you for 24 hours and you just stand there and what, you just fucking shrug? None of your friends have seen you, you don't answer your-- What's that? What, what has happened to you? Kai this, this isn't like you. -If your dad was here he'd-- -Yeah well he's not. He left this shit hole years ago. Kai. What's going on, man? I slept with Grace. -Fucking hell mate! -Shit! No. Not like that. We shared a bed. Nothing happened. Your eye though. -Kenner. -Yeah. - No I mean, shit look, it's Kenner! - Oi oi! Fucking hell, boys, he's lost it. That looks aggressive. -Shit, do we run? -Kai? -Why aren't we running? -Alright boys? Where did you get that shiner mate? Although, I think it might be a bit of an improvement. Hey? Alright dickhead? Alright Grace? I need your help. You're good at English, right? It's just, some of the texts are really confusing and uh... ...yeah. If I come by your house will you help me? Okay. Cool. Let's have a drag on that. Come and get it then. Cheeky cunt. Are you guys coming with us tomorrow? Yeah so a few of us are going up the beacon tomorrow. Should be a laugh and that. Craig you still have that rifle your brother had? That was well good. Yeah but I'm not really supposed to... Oh come on mate. Your brother used to always bring it out for the boys. I... Don't be a pussy, Craig. It'll be a laugh, like. We can shoot beer cans when we're done with them. Uh yeah. Yeah yeah alright, alright. Nice one. Alright, boys. Catch you later yeah? - Kai? - Yeah? Can I unclench my anus now? Fucking hell! You're not really gonna bring that rifle are you mate? I mean I guess so. It'll still be hidden under my brother's old bed but I've not really used it like, on my own before. What if he slays you with it? What if he slays me if I don't bring it? Valid. Either way, someone's getting slain. Hey, seriously though, don't bring it if you don't want to he's not going to do anything. I'm sorry have you looked in the mirror recently mate? Nah it'll be fine boys. But I can't let my mam know I've got it okay, so you've gotta help me sneak it out first thing. - Yeah man, no worries. - Nice. Is it just me, or is Kenner's dick massive? Oi! - Stop right there! - Shit! Fuck! Go, go, go, go! Come here, you! Kai? What the hell you doing here, son, eh? We had reports of public nudity and a commotion on the roof. You stink of marijuana! Oh God, I'm gonna have to search you. You got anything on you you shouldn't have, hey? - I hope not. - Hope not! You're testing my patience son! Days before your final exams, and you're getting high and trespassing when you should be studying. You are smart enough to know you're acting like a fucking moron! What is this, hey? What the fuck is this? You're carrying knives around now, are you? No, Phil. You've known me, forever. I'm not gonna hurt anyone with that thing it's a memento. Ward to Henshaw, come in. Over. Henshaw here, over. Lost the two little fuckers running west on Lansdown. Have you got the stray one in cuffs? Over. Henshaw? Over. No he ran past me. Last seen heading north on Grayson Lane. Green shirt. Over. Copy. I'll call it in. Over. Hi. Your mum let me in. You know, for someone so good at English you don't talk much. Sorry. I brought my stuff. Yeah? Yeah. So what do you need help with? What's this? Ah, it's nothing, really. Doesn't look like nothing. Why are some of the words circled? I like to know the definitions when I write. Like, every word has its own story. "Absolution, noun, a formal release from guilt or an ecclesiastical remission of sin imparted by a priest, as in the sacraments of penance". Why is that one... Wait, are these your notes? "The sequence of syllables sound authoritative, whilst granting an inherent sense of divinity, and... hope". Step out of my mind. Shall we? I thought you two might like some revision nutrition. We're fine Mum. Kai! Thank you, Mrs. Matthews. Oh ignore him. He's just embarrassed. Why can't you be polite like your friends, hm? Thanks, Mum. See? Not so difficult. So um, how's revision going? Better now, thank you. Great! I'll leave you to it. Your mum is really nice. Yeah. A bit much sometimes, but... I know the feeling. Where's your dad? He left. No I mean where did he go? I don't know, it was a few years ago now. That's pretty shitty. Is it? Well, just leaving. Can't blame him. I mean, this place. It's not like you get to do things twice it's your life. Just ask this guy! You believe that? Well, Henchard's character is a lot more complicated but... No. The bit about doing what you want because you only get one shot? You believe that? Yeah I do. Shit. -What? -I've... I've gotta go. Sorry. I hate the veil. An oppressor of warmth, you wear in secret. Blinds my eyelids and rules my dreams. Born from the scars in your past that, celebrate the confusion of my future. I want to exist in a place where the softness you feel for me, isn't something that scares you. Where the fear of softness, doesn't exist at all. Get out! Get out of my house! Go on! Alright boys! Get ready I'll pass her down. - C'mon Megsy mate. - Shhh it's a delicate process lads. Right. Here she comes! Well that's just shit, mate. Fucking hell, boys, I thought this would work. Mate, just pull it back up and walk it downstairs. What just walk past my Mam with it? No, I mean like, stick it down your pants or something. Down me pants? "Now Craig, now Craig, now wait a minute, what's... ...what's that you got there, son?" "What's, what's what, Mam? Oh you mean the big fuck off rifle shaped object in my trousers?" "Yes Craig. Yeah that's just my fucking rifle Mam." Hang on a minute boys. What the fuck is he doing up there? - Megsy mate, come on just throw it! - Look, Samuel... I'm no gunsmith, but I do have an inkling that throwing a dodgy old rile out of a second-floor window probably isn't the best of ideas! -Fair. -Fair. You'll just have to reach. - That's it, mate, keep it coming. - Just a little further. Shit. Go back up! Back up? Shit! Oh dear. Fuck! The fuck? The fuck happened to you cunts? Well don't just stand there you bag of dicks, get in. Try not to let too much smoke out, yeah? Fucking hell lads you're gonna let it all out. Twats. - What happened to your face? - Rifle. Chair leg snapped. Pull! What's your deal? - My deal? - Yeah. What's your deal? I asked first, writer boy. I asked second. I hardly see you anymore. I haven't been hiding. Are you leaving after summer? Yeah. For good? Hopefully. My mum says she can get me a job in the salon and I can, "work my way up." That's cool. Is it? Is it what you want? People don't just get to do what they want. You might enjoy it. It could be... I don't want to get stuck here either, Kai. Pull! He strikes again! Where did the time go? What? It seems like only last summer we were around each other's house in a paddling pool. In your green speedos. That's right. I haven't forgotten. Though green was never really your colour. We grew up. Yeah, well. I think I've had enough of growing up. At least for now. Pull! We're out of satanic babies. Fuck's sake! Kenner? What are you doing? I'm gonna get that little fucker. - That's somebody's cat. - I don't give a shit. - Kenner, no. - Fuck off Megsy! Kenner don't! Fuck's sake! Fucking piece of shit. Maybe you left the safety on. Does it look like this thing has a fucking safety? Maybe the barrel's blocked. Oh fuck! Let me have a look at it. To be fair, mate, it's his gun. No. It's his brother's. And to be fair he ain't gonna be needing it anymore, is he? What the fuck did he just say? -Megsy, Megsy! -Hey! -What the fuck did you just say? -Fuck off! - I'll fucking... -Get off him! Oh my god, what the fuck! Fucking hell, boys. Right, I need a spliff. Billy let's go up beacon. What the fuck was that? A "how not to" on gun safety. You alright, Megsy? For you good sir. I say old chap. Much obliged. Master Craig, it would be my pleasure to fashion you a doobie forged from the finest Ganja that could be procured from the gentle soul trading behind the bus shelter. Go on then mate. Right boys! Anyone who can climb up behind me can have a spliff with me. Why would we want to do that? Oh for fuck's sake. One must not simply concede when ones honour is brought into question Kai. You're a dick. - Go up there and get it mate. - Go on Kai. You used to climb up there all the time when we were kids. You should see the view from up here mate. You look like a tiny pussy. Alright. Hold this. Glad you could join me mate. Cheers, I guess. Alright mate, don't lick a horse gift in the mouth. Sure. I'm fucking joking, mate. What kind of a mug do you take me for? I just don't know you that well man. Yeah? Well I know you. Okay. What do you know? You're clever. And you write. And you think you're better than all of us. I don't. - You are. - What? You're better. Better than me. Better than him. Better than her. - You're weak. - I mean. What? No. Up here. You want out. But you're too scared of leaving. I'm not scared of leaving. Yeah. Out there... ...you ain't better. - There's nothing keeping me here. - Nothing? Don't lie, mate. You know people say you're so intelligent, Kai, but... take a look around you mate. Why the fuck would you want out of all this? You will leave though. - And she'll stay. - What? - I've seen the way you look at her. - Wait Kenner I... You ought to be really fucking careful mate. I will die before I give her up. I'm fucking messing with you dickhead. Funny fucker. Shit! And the door was open? Like... ...she left it open? Literally open. -Maybe she was just fucked up. -She didn't look it. -Maybe she was letting the cat out. -She doesn't have a cat. The dog. Shit man, I don't know, if it was on, you would have gone over there right? I mean you would go over... ...right? Yeah. So it wasn't on. No. I don't know! You overthink things, man, come on. You need to get out of your head. And besides, she's got a boyfriend, bro. If you keep pursuing this it's only going to end with you getting the shit kicked out of you by a psycho in a fur coat. Look, it's not like I don't see the connection, man. Of course I do. But we've only got a couple days of school left and after summer you're gonna be out of here anyway so... ...forget about her. Right, well, I have got an exam to pass. Take it easy bro. Hey. How's it going? "Fork Amnesty. Ladies and gents, it appears we have a mystery on our hands. In excess of 120 forks have been stolen from the dining room. The longer this continues the greater the punishment will become. Yours, Hurt." 120? They're shitting it. - We've got more in each bucket. - So what's the count at? - 532 last I checked. - Still not enough though. -What's not enough? -Oh, uh um. Not enough forks eh boys? - Come on man don't. - Fuck off you prick. So you need more? Well that's good. 'Cause there's a whole load coming in tonight. - What? - Cousin works in the kitchen. Chong and I can help. -Me? -You mean Chang, dickhead. Whatever. Deploy the Asian. No one's gonna remember his face are they? A blitz operation. In and out with all the remaining forks in the blink of an eye. What are you doing later? -We should celebrate. -Celebrate what? Are you kidding? Um, only the end of exams, the start of summer, and... our new found friendship. Um, yeah sure. I'll see you later. Yeah? Hi. Hey. What's up? - Not much. - Cool. Yeah. Who's your friend? Hey! What? Look, dude. I don't know what's going on in your head but, you have a boyfriend, so... What the fuck are you doing? I have to go. I'm gonna be late for my exam. Okay. Will you come round tonight? - Sure. - Cool. Wait a sec. Can't have everyone knowing we're getting it on in the supply closet. Right. Give it a minute. Wait! Close the door. What is this? I can't let you leave until you tell me what this means. I've just got a lot going on in my mind right now. It's like this crescendo of crippling uncertainty that could emotionally devour me from the inside and it's... ...and it's totally hilarious for you. Okay, great thanks for the orgasm, bye! I'm breaking up with him. Okay? Okay. I'll see you later. Text me. Okay. Clear up your locker, Evans, and take yourself off the school premises. - What number is your locker? - Twelve, sir. It's here, open it. - What's going on? - Rue's been expelled. Got caught cheating in his History exam. Hurt's having him clear out his locker. Open it. I can call for maintenance and have it forced open. - Shit. - Nothing to see here. Shit! I knew you were a cheater. You're a thief as well. Believe it you're going to see the Head. This way, come on! Call an emergency meeting. That was like a third of the forks. -We physically can't do it without them. -I'm thinking, alright? Fuckers! What did you do? I don't want to talk about it. Hey! Wait! Told you fuckers I had a strategy. So! What we doing with them? With what? With the forks you fucking spastic! - I mean we're just... - Just... Stealing them. You know? For the bants. For the bants? Right. Okay. That's cool. Funny. All right then shitheads, I need to head to my night job. Oi Dev? Cool if I borrow this, yeah? - Yeah. - Cool. What the fuck? "Uh, yeah!" What are you thinking? Dude! I think I peed a little. Grace? Grace? Are you, um... How are you feeling? This was a mistake. Nothing happened. No. Honestly. This whole thing. What do you mean? Yesterday, when... I was fucked up yesterday. All-day. You should go. -But, Grace... -Leave. What are you doing? Write something, Kai. Right, get up. Get the fuck up, Kai. Kai, Kai, stop it. Kai, listen to me, stop this. Unless someone's died or is literally dying right now I don't want to hear about it. Stop it. Do you have any idea how many students we get through these doors as talented as you are? Do you really wanna go out there, you want to kiss goodbye to the last two years and your chances of going to university? You have offers on the table with great mentors. Whatever is going on in your mind, right now you need to take a moment and you need to ask yourself, is it worth it? Is it worth going back out there staring at a blank page until the bell rings and that becoming your life? In two days time will it be worth it? Two weeks from now is it going to be worth it? Five years down the road, Kai do you really think you're gonna look back and say "you know what, that pathetic self-pity session that I pulled in my English Lit final, yeah you know what yeah that was really fucking worth it". Do you have any idea how lucky you are to be good at what you like? Don't you dare fucking waste that. Now get out there and put pen to paper. Alright? You are gonna be fantastic one day, at whatever you choose to do. Talent always prevails. Passion and creativity always prevail. They drag you out of the shit, and they carry you to better places, and I'll say "Kai Matthews... ...he's the proof". A mistake? So what you just woke up, rolled over, and she said everything was a mistake? Pretty much, yeah. Time to move on. Or time to win her back. Right, I've gotta go. I'm on duty. So you never thanked me. Oh I, I really appreciate what you did back there. No, no. Not that. Then what? Gaining substance. Experiencing the world around you. Sir, it was a complete fucking disaster! No it wasn't. Hurricanes and terrorist attacks are complete fucking disasters. Hooking up with the second hottest girl on campus in a supply closet... ...that's pretty badass. But what about? You came out of it with a story to tell and the experience to tell it. You're welcome. This is it, boys! Come on. One more day. One more day! Hey! Time out, time out, time out. We pretend with fingers in our wounds. Escapes path is labeled hope. Why does it not hurt you? The sign reads destruction. You okay? Hey. Hi. Um... Yeah. So you totally ditched me the other day. After school? Oh shit! Shit, yeah, sorry, something... ...came up. Something. I hate it when that happens. Yeah uh, I'm sorry. It's okay I forgive you. It didn't happen to have anything to do with that girl, did it? What girl? The girl you can't keep your eyes off while you're talking to me. This one right.... Because it seems to me like she's spoken for. Seems that way. Kai? Yeah? If I promise not to point will you loosen your grip on my arm? Um, sure. Let's grab a drink. - Mate, don't do it! - Quiet! Craig you physically cannot do a backflip even when you're sober! Me Mam says I'm an athlete. Fuck! Oh my God! Oh Sammy! So how come I never see you around school? Maybe you just weren't looking. Okay. - When did you join? - Like five years ago. What, fuck off. We had Science together for two years. We did? We were lab partners in year 10, you dick! Remember the experiment where we had to test the reaction for the alkali metal with water? Yeah. Yeah, yeah I remember. I transferred at the start of this term we don't have class together. Oh my. Oh my God, you... You are pure evil. Guilty. At least that's what they say. Why did you move? Expelled for lies, conspiracy and or treachery? God no, much more exciting. My dad had to move for work. Wait, people move here for work? Jesus, where did you live before? You're funny. Oh shit! No way! - Oh shit, dude. - What? Look at us, man. What the fuck are we doing? Playing in the water like a pair of pre-pubescent fucktards? No fuck this mate I'm getting out and talking to some girls. No, no, no. - One more backflip. - What, no mate. You haven't even come close all night. -Please just one more! -No, no, no. Megsy! We've nearly finished sixth form and I'm still a fucking virgin. Fine, fine. One more. I've got a good feeling about this one bro! Where are we going? Somewhere no one will see. What is it? Kai? Uh, nothing I just... thought I... saw something. Saw what? The Stag. The Stag? I mean I thought I saw a stag. I'm sorry. It's cool. No, I... I mean I sorry I stood you up. Well that's also cool. Because I guess it means you owe me one. One what? I dunno. Geronimo! Megsy! Will you cum with me? I'm close. Help!! Help!! What the fuck was that? Help! Sammy? Help! Help me! Come on! - Someone fucking help! - Get him. - Come on. - Come on. Megsy, Megsy! He can't breathe! What do we do? What the fuck do we do! - Someone do something! - Someone call an ambulance! He's gonna die unless we do something! Does anybody know CPR? Ah, fuck! Come on, man, come on! -Am I doing this right? -I don't know. Blow in his mouth. - Geez, I... - Blow in his mouth! It's not working. No, no. It's not working! Wait. Wait, stop, stop! What are you doing? We've got to clear his airways. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hey, hey, hey... Megsy, Megsy, Megsy... Told you I could a backflip. Fuck off Megsy you nearly died. Or did die. On a scale of nought to dead you looked pretty fucking dead mate. I swear you better be less of a cock-block at the party tomorrow. Cock-block? I didn't see you making any progress with the ladies. Yeah probably because I had to spend the entire night watching your shite gymnastics attempts. Alright, mate, alright. Did see you emerging from the forest with Emma though. As if, mate, you couldn't see anything through your tears. Were you crying, bra? Oh excuse me for shedding a couple after pulling my mate's lifeless body out of a fucking lake! That's so pathetic! Oh thank you, bro. And thank fuck someone was listening to Mrs. Chambers' pool safety class in primary school! You know instead of bombing in the deep end. Some things never change. Oh did I cock-block you too? Uh no, it was a joint effort to be fair. Sammy's high pitched squeals are a bit of a boner killer. Oh fuck off guys, come on. Not just me though. Kenner too. Kenner? - He was there with Lisa Silver. - Seriously! Oh she is so fit! Are you gonna tell Grace, mate? She made her choice. Lisa Silver. I used to spend many a night thinking about her. Well no don't worry, mate, this changes absolutely nothing between the two of you. - Yeah? - Yeah. You still got zero chances with her, so... I'm under no illusions there boys, don't worry. Besides, you know, nice guys always finish last. We're not nice guys, mate. We're just... We're just guys! - We barely even finish. - No thanks to his squeals! Fuck you both! Next time I'll just let him die then, shall I? Do you remember that assembly we had in primary school? The one where Mr. Edwin told us the story about the time his headmaster sat his class down at the start of their school lives and... he told them that by the time they graduate one of them will have died. It turned out that... one of his friends actually did die on the last day of school starting a, petrol mower or something. That shit was nearly me. Thanks for having my back, boys. Not just today but for all of school and that. Cheers, boys. Cheers. Alright, boys! We go in under the metal gate behind the chapel. Oh for fuck's sake. What's he doing here? Oh who told him? Yeah I might've said something. - Alright boys? - Alright, Kenner? What you... What you doing? I get it. I help you steal this shit but you don't want me involved in the main event, yeah? You fucking spineless cunts! No, I just meant, like what you doing? You're... late. Late? Alright. Go on then. Grab a bucket. Hang on. - What about the NCD? - I thought we weren't doing an NCD. How are we gonna do this and an NCD? - What no NCD? - What's an NCD? Naked Chapel Dash. - Naked what? - That's just school legend. Leavers tradition not legend, Scout. The hundred-yard naked midnight dash between the chapel and the main school building. - Across the cricket pitch? - Yeah. - I thought that was a joke. - Fuck's sake. Come on, no one knows anyone who's actually done it. Yeah, 'cause they've all left school haven't they? My brothers both did it. Two years and six years ago. See? Any minute now a naked teenage ass will come striding past your left shoulder and this year... Ha ha ha... This year, we'll be ready. We're going to get them. Yeah but, logistically... Come on guys, the forks and the NCD on the same night? You want to break into the school on two separate occasions, do you? What's the matter boys? You pussies afraid of getting your little mags out? -No! -Yes! No. But Mr. Hurt, it's already past midnight. When have you ever known a Year Thirteen to be punctual, Scout? I think what Mr Scout is trying to say is... as much as we love cheese, whiskey and each other's company how do we know the Naked Chapel Dash isn't just a rumor? Trust me. Shut the fuck up! Shhh! For fuck's sake guys! I think it's time we call it a night. Did you hear that? What is it? Something's coming. Something big. Go, go, go! Boys. Take a row. What are you doing? I'm calling for back up. Eddie, Dave. This is Hurt. You copy? Copy. This is Eddie. Copy. This is Dave. Hurt, there is something mighty strange going on. What do you see? Nothing. But there's this noise, see? Yes, yes, we hear it. Whatever it is, it's getting nearer. Sounds like something mechanical. Mobile One... can you see anything? Nothing's come through the main gate, Hurt. Well keep me posted. - Have you got the dog? - Yes sir. Eleanor is with me. She is not happy. I haven't fed her yet. Good. Well get ready. They're up to something. What the fuck are you looking at? I'm not so sure about these balaclavas, boys. Well of course we're not gonna show our faces, Megsy! Look! I'm not being funny, but if someone told to me to imagine a... gang of marauding rapists this is... I mean yeah this is pretty much what I'd come up with! Pretty fucking menacing if you ask me, boys. Nice one, boys. Let's do this. Oi! They're coming. Shit! Let's see you boys outrun the hound. Fuck! What the fuck was that? Let Eleanor loose. - Dog! - Shit! Fuck! Rope! Come on Chang mate, keep up, son! Come here, boy! Dave, they're heading for the road! Eddie! Eddie! Kai, slow down! Please! I have a stitch! Take off the balaclava, mate, it's fucking creepy! - I can't remove it! - Just pull it off! No, I do not wish to show my face! What would you rather declare on a resume? Public nudity charges or... balaclava-donning sex offender? My room's up on the right. So how was your day? My, my day? Yes, Kai, your day. How was it? Strange, uh... but good, pretty, pretty good. Yes, I can see that. I was expecting you back earlier, than this but as long as you're prepared. Prepared? You mean for the exam? Yes honey, for the exam. I'll leave you to it. Now that's legendary. A proper leavers prank. - You should've taken geometry bro. - It's just the lines. Who did this? It was a cohort of masked, naked lunatics. Masked, naked, lunatics. You're going to have to do better than that! Anyone? Somebody had better start talking. I intend to make an example of these vandals! Thought you could get away with it hey Wong? Come with me. Pens down. Stop writing. Free! He got the 'Wong' guy! Thank fuck he didn't recognise him! Yeah! Ah! My drink! Who do you think you are? Fuck off you elitist bitch. I'm sorry, what? School's over, alright, it's done. I'm no one but now... so are you. Oh my God! - What a loser! - He is kind of cute though. Don't. What? Don't pretend to like me. I'm not. It's cruel. But I'm not. I do like you. Please. What the fuck, man? You want her. Not me. I'm not spending my summer with someone pining after someone else. No it's... No what? What are you doing? I like you. Then tell me you want me more than you want her. You can't. For fuck's sake! 'Hey, it's Emma. Leave a message.' 'Hey, you've got Sammy. You know what to do.' Kai. Are you okay? Not now. Can we talk? It was always you I wanted. Just stop fucking with me Grace. I've been looking for you. What? Come with me. Come on. Get in. Why? I need your help with something. Get in the fucking car Kai! I know what you've been up to. Yeah I seen ya. Saw me what? Don't play fucking dumb, mate. Come on mate you know I saw you fucking that new girl in the forest. Oh right, um. Emma. Yeah. Whatever. You see who I was with? Well did you? No. Lisa Silver. What do you think about that? About me fucking Lisa Silver? I don't know, man. Well! Like aren't you with Grace? Grace. My Grace. Yeah? You want to talk about Grace. You know it's funny you should mention Grace, actually. Grace. Well she likes someone else. You know she even tried breaking up with me. After everything that I've done for her, break up with me. Can you believe that? Well that fucking bitch got what she deserved, didn't she? -Where are we going? -I told her that he was gonna get it. He needs to pay. But she says, she says she's not seeing anyone else. Funny that. Lying fucking bitch. We're friends, ain't we, Kai? We're mates, ain't we? Ain't we, hm? Yeah. We're mates. Yeah. And mates, they have each other's backs, don't they? Yeah. Good. 'Cause we're going round his house now. And we're gonna gut him like a fucking fish. Who? You'll see when we get there mate. I'm stuck! I can't get it. I'm stuck! Kai, I'm fucking stuck! Cut me loose! Kai! Help me! Kai!! Kai! Kai! Kai! Kai!! Kai! Kai! "philophobia, the fear of falling in love" PHILOPHOBIA
