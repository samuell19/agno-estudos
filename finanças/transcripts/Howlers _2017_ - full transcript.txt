- A long time ago, there were legends in the west. Law men and outlaws alike. Some legends, some stories, were better left untold. But sometimes, the past has a way of finding the light. - Señor. They're coming. Willie Price, a very dangerous man. You're gonna get yourself killed. - Whatever happens, don't come outside. - Hello Colt. - I see you got my invitation. - Oh I got it all right. You know it's a shame what you did there to Tommy. He was one of my brightest. - You got my condolences. - So now what? - I'm tired of huntin' vermin. It's time to end this, right here, right now. - You hear that boys? The slayer here is tired of huntin' vermin. Now those are some pretty harsh words. I hope you can back 'em up. - Only one way to find out. - That's enough. Colt I warned you not to bring this fight here boy. - Sheriff. With all respect, you better stay the hell out of this one. - I don't think so, son. This is still my town. William Price, you are under arrest for murder and robbery. And you will stand before the judge come Monday morning. - I never argue with a man of the law. Well, I guess we better surrender, boys. - Sheriff, you need to get your ass inside now. - You brought this upon yourself. - What? Get on at 'em boys. - Willie! - Are you scared, slick? 'Cause you should be! Remember this? You should, because it's gonna send you back where you belong. You. I did everything you asked. It's finished! Now end this. - Uh, good mornin' sunshine. - Morning. Some storm we had last night, huh? - Yeah, it sure was. Forget we had dinner plans here last night? - Sorry. It turned out to be a late night at the hospital, you know, with the storm and all. - Mhm. Your shift ended what, a couple hours ago? - Yeah, well I had some shopping to do. You know, our daughter's coming in this weekend, in case you forgot. - No, I didn't forget. I'm just sayin', two hours seems like a long time to do your shoppin'. - You really wanna do this right now? - I'm making an observation. - No you're not. You're accusing me of something. - Karen, I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm saying your shift ended at five am and it's 7:30. - Well he's a cop, chief. - Oh come on, come on. - I'm going to bed. I don't want Emily to know that we're having problems, so, can we just pretend to get along while she's here, please? - Sure. - Thanks. - Hardy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. Meg, Meg say that again. I'll be right there. - Please. Help me. - Mornin' Terry. - Sheriff. Got ourselves a weird one here. - Mornin' Ethan. Glad you could finally join us. Hey, when did you start wearing the badge on the wrong side of your shirt? - The day I started to resent this miserable job. - I'm sure we could rectify that for ya. - Keep trying, Dwayne. Got your head so far up the mayor's ass, I'm gonna fill out a missing persons report on you. - That's good, I like it. - Can we clear all these people out of here, please? - Yeah folks, come on, let's go. - Go on home. - Thank you, appreciate it. Appreciate it. Well, Sandra Baker called it in. Apparently she was watching the kids while the Neelon's were out of town on business. She says the snuck out early this morning, saw the coffins and unfortunately, found the body. Ethan, there's something else though-- - Yeah, put a pin in it. I don't want these kids seeing this. - Sure. - Mornin', doc. - Mornin' to you, too, Ethan. They say our jobs are boring here in Temple Wells. You better brace yourself. - Good God All Mighty. Who is that? Is that Burt Thompson? - The one and only. - Jesus. - Heartbreaking isn't it? He's been fishing out here for years. - What would cause all that? - It depends on the answer you're looking for. - How is that? - Well it's a viscous attack, sheriff. - An animal? - On any other given day I would say yes. - What does that mean? - Well if it were an animal, it'd have to be smart one, with a knowledge of human anatomy because every major organ was severed. Very concisely. - Cover him up. I wanna keep this quiet. - My thoughts exactly. - Thank you doc. Sandra. - I must've dozed off, Ethan. I mean, I didn't even know that they were even gone until Terry called. I mean between working at the dinner, watching the kids, I'm really sorry. - It's not your fault, don't worry about it. Can I talk to that little one there? - It's okay darling, he's the sheriff. - Come down here sweetheart, let me ask you a question. Can you uh, can you remember what you saw? - They were monsters. - Monsters? - They weren't monsters. - No that's okay, that's okay. Monsters. Well what kind of monsters were they? Can you tell me? - They had big teeth and long, sharp claws. - They were werewolves, retard. - Okay. Werewolves. I think we got about all we need. You get 'em home, I'll contact the parents to come home early. If there's anything else, we'll call ya. - I appreciate it sheriff. - Sure. Thank you dear. - All right Sandra. Thanks kids. - Come on kids. I don't know, but, I'd say these coffins have to be at least over a hundred years old. - Yeah. - Something to do with the storm we had last night, huh? - Maybe the storm's what brought 'em to the surface? - Possibility. - I don't know about you Ethan, but, I'd feel a whole lot better if there were some bones in these coffins. - Yeah, and if it didn't look like somethin' clawed its way out of 'em. Get on the horn and have some good old boys come down and haul these out of the water, get 'em down to the station. - Absolutely. ♪ A relationship with you is just like ♪ ♪ Runnin' a marathon in quicksand ♪ ♪ The harder I try the faster my heart folds ♪ - Wild Joe.

He killed the Judge! - It's nothing personal, bro! - Lucy! - Hi. - It's so good to see you. - I thought you weren't coming 'til Friday. - Lucy, it is Friday. - Right. Oh, god, I'm sorry, I've just been really off. How are you doing? How's school? - It's good. A girl can only take so many frat parties and jello shots. - I can imagine. Oh, it's really good to see you. I missed you. - I missed you, too. You know what, speaking of shots, I could really use one before I face my pill popping mother. - Oh um, you know what? Let's actually, I was gonna go to The Nest. Let's just meet there in a few minutes. - But shots are free here. Why don't we-- - Um. I just wanna get out of the house, you know? - Wait, since when can I not come in? And you seem nervous? Like why do you keep looking over your shoulder? - No I'm not nervous, I'm not nervous. - You have a guy in there, don't you? - It's not like that. - You slut. Why didn't you just say so? - Shut up. - Okay. Okay. You just go back to doing whatever it is you were doing, or whoever you were doing. - There is no-- - And I will go say hello to my soul crushing parents. - Hey, don't say anything. - Where am I?

They should fit. - Good. I'm gonna need steel, and iron. Oh, these'll do. - What do you think you're doin'? - You got silver bullets? - Yeah, actually, I do. Why, are you huntin' werewolves? - How far to Canyon Creek? - Canyon Creek? Canyon Creek doesn't exist anymore. It's Temple Wells now. - How far? - 15 minutes. - Good. I'll need a horse. There used to be stories about the future having machines just like this. These horseless carriages. What do you call it? - Most people would just call this a piece of junk. Have you really never driven a truck before? - I've never seen a truck before. It must seem strange to you. - Oh no, nothin' about you is strange. So where exactly am I taking you? - Take me to a saloon. A saloon? Like a bar? Why do you wanna go there? - Well how else do you get information? - I don't know, the internet? - Inter-what? - All right. Listen dude, you and I are gonna make a deal right now. I'm gonna take you to the saloon so you can get your information and then this is done. And we're just gonna go our separate ways. Deal? - You have my word. - All right then. Now I'm gonna start this engine and it's gonna be loud, so, try not to shoot me. So did you like escape from some kind of government research facility or somethin'? - What? No. I come from a place, well, far away from here. - Okay. Well you got a name? - James Franklin Colt, Jr. - Well, James Franklin Colt, Jr., you don't seem like much of a criminal to me. Did you escape from a hospital? Do you have issues? - How are we able to move this fast? - Well, the pedal on the left makes us stop, and the pedal on the right makes us go. Consider that your first driving lesson. - Looks easy enough. Don't worry, I'm no hard case. I mean you no harm. - Well that's good to know. You know, Temple Wells isn't much to see anymore. Used to be a mining town back in the 1800s. - I know. - Woo hoo hoo! Yeah! Thing kicks like an ex-wife. - Always a pleasure, Mr. Mayor. - Yeah it is. - Mornin', Bob. - I'll see my way out. - Yeah you do that. - And you know that'll illegal as hell, don't you, Mr. Mayor? - Well I figure it's a little illegal. Everything is, though, isn't it? Ethan. You look like a man that's got somethin' on his mind. So why don't you say what you came out here to say? Son of a bitch. - No see, you're pullin' it. You gotta squeeze it. - Eh. I think it's just the gun. - I did come out here to tell you somethin'. Somethin' serious. - Well I figure serious best be rinsed down with a cocktail, don't you? Let's move inside. Well. I'm not under arrest am I? - Uh no. - Well. Then I'm all ears. What do you got? - Well you know Burt Thompson. Well Burt's dead. - Oh shit. - You think that's funny? - Jesus Christ, Ethan, look at your face. You'd think the Marines had landed or some shit. He's the town drunk. I'm surprised he lasted that long, been chuggin' turpentine his whole damn life. - He was murdered, Bob. I mean, I think that's odd, don't you? That'd be the first homicide in this little town in, well ever, as far as I can tell. - So how'd that happen now? - I don't know. Body was pretty torn up. - How do you even know it's a homicide then? - A hunch. - A hunch? - Yeah. - You're crazy. You gonna hang your hat on a hunch? - You'd be surprised. Cops do it all the time. You forget about that? - I don't forget about anything. - Look I just stopped by here to tell you Burt Thompson's dead. Figured you oughta know, you being the mayor and all. - What happened to us, huh? We used to be partners, you know. The two of us, we've seen more shit than any two humans are supposed to see in a goddamn life time. We used to trust each other with our lives. - Yes, sir, we did. That went right out the window the day you started sleepin' with my wife. - What the fuck did you just say? - You heard me. You've been carrying a torch for Karen since the day you met her. You know it and I know it. - Now see Ethan, shit like that. That's how I know you lost your goddamn mind. - She started working nights all of a sudden, comin' in early in the morning, can't look me in the eye. I don't need to be a cop to see what's going on. - Ethan, Ethan, Ethan-- - I'd appreciate it if you started calling me sheriff. - Yeah. - I thank you for the drink. - Do you mind? - Sure.

Requesting immediate assistance, please respond. - What's going on Meg? - You know how we've been having some trouble with that biker gang, Black Cross? - Yeah. - I don't think they're gonna be much trouble anymore. - Problem? - Jesus. Hey. Hey. - Hey. - Jesus! Walter. Do not sneak up on me like that. - Eh, I never seen nothin' like this, Ethan. Poor Joe saw the whole thing. - Joe? Joe? You all right? Tell me what happened here. Start from the beginnin'. - Well I was just comin' from-- - Not you. Him. - Sheriff. Me and the boys, we was just going out for a ride. We thought we'd stop for just a few brain grenades. Next thing we know, six men, they just, they just came up on us, from nowhere. Took our clothes, our guns, our women. This one dude, he just, he just punched his hand right through Judge and ripped out his heart. After that, he was all interested in our bikes. Wanted to learn how to ride, insisted on it. They were just screwing around with us. I don't remember anything after that. I just remember waking up, just seeing everybody dead. - All right. All right. We're gonna get you some help. - Did they say where they were headin'? Drop the gun sheriff. - Not likely. - Don't make me ask again. Which way did they go? - They were lookin' for a hide out. I told them about the old machine factory. - You know where that is? Well let's go. - Oh no, no, no, you're not goin' anywhere. - I hate to do this to you, sheriff. But you got a whole lot of trouble coming your way. - Now see, what do you mean by that? You know what's going on here? You a part of this? - You seem like a good man, and a good man will get that gentleman to a doc. - Go on Lucy, it's all right. - Don't worry. I'll see you soon. - Oh you're damn right you will. Meg, I need all my deputies down here. I needed 'em 15 minutes ago. - Copy that sheriff. - Walter, go get your gun. - You bet. - We are goin' huntin'. - What is it? - I'm not goin' any further with you until I get some answers. - Now is not the time. - Come clean or I walk. - Lucy. These men are not like other men. It's very important that I reach them before nightfall or more people will get killed. - You're so full of shit. - I can't explain everything right now. But I need you to believe me when I tell you that I don't get to that factory before your sheriff does, he will die. Please. - All right. Come on. It's just up the way. - All right, here's the schematics. - Is that upside-down Ethan? - Shut up Walter. Now as far as I can tell, there are five entrances into this place. Sacks, Robertson, you take the eastern and western entrance. Dwayne, you and Martin take the rear. Walter, you and I are gonna go in the front door, that's right. According to Joe, there are six men heavily armed. You encounter one of these fugitives, you do not engage. You call for help, are we clear? - Yes, sir. - Saddle up. - Those are? - Oh, motorcycles. Hogs, choppers. They're like-- - Steel horses. - Now you're catchin' on. - You'd better get back to town now. - What? Why? - I told you. These are dangerous men. - Colt, I-- - This is no place for a woman. Now go home. - Did you really just say that? - Well say what? - You really are like some kind of an old fossil, aren't you? You know what, fine, whatever. Do it yourself, I'm gone. No place for a woman? Really? - Damn that woman's a firecracker. - Hey Ethan. - What? - You, you aint gonna like, let me killed or nothin', are ya? - Walter, you are startin' to make me regret deputizing you. Look, just keep your gun up. Keep your ass clenched. Do not shoot the wrong person. - Okay. Hey. - What? - You hear anything? - I hear you talkin', shut up. Sacks is down, repeat, Sacks is down! - Come on, go, go, go, go. - Calm down, hold. Yeah, hold on, are you all right? What's going on? - They're chasing us. - Okay, all right. - Dammit. Got something. Shh. Over there, over there. - What is it? - Well hell, I don't know. - I'm sure he's fine, let's keep movin'. - You've gotta be kidding me. - What, you got an issue with that, rookie? - Hold your horses Chuck Norris. We gotta go find the sheriff. - Hold on, hold on. Do you hear that? - No I didn't hear anyt-- Okay, I heard that. What the? - Oh my... - This is Hardy, I hear gunfire, over. Yeah, we got him. And man, you are not gonna believe this shit. - All right, Mr. Colt. I need you to shed some light on what the hell is going on in my town. You can start with these. They all washed up this mornin'. - Built these with my bare hands. - Son, the structure of these coffins date back to the mid-1800s. - The year was 1861. Civil War just broke. I joined the Union Army, 21st infantry, under the command of my father, Colonel James Franklin Colt, Sr. All I ever wanted to do was make him proud. - All boys wanna be like their father. But this is war, Colt. - I won't be away forever. - What if I never see you again? - Well you can't think like that. Here. I got somethin' for ya. To help pass the time. - Wha, what? What? - Lydia, I want you to be my wife. - What? - Right now. Come on. It was during the Battle of Bull Run. That's when they came. - That's when who came? - The lycanthrope. The howlers. Well they looked human at first, disguised as soldiers. The leader of the pack was a man by the name of William Price. They were able to transform into these beastly creatures. Werewolves, as some would call them. They took my father's life, along with most of our garrison. I was able to escape, and return home. It'd been two years since I'd seen my wife. One night I went to town for supplies. Someone from Price's gang must've spotted me 'cause when I returned home, he and his men were waitin' for me. I'm sure you all can imagine how it escalated from there. - Hello? Who's out there? - Lydia? - Colt. - No, no, no, no. - To pass the time. - No. No, no, no. I held my Lydia in my arms, and then began a storm. It was unlike any storm I'd ever seen before. Lightening was almost blinding. - We had one hell of a storm last night. - Well damn doc. Let the man finish his story. - After the sky cleared, a hooded man came to me from out of nowhere. He called himself the Keeper. Told me that he came from another dimension, a place known as the Afterworld. That he lived many lifetimes dating back to the Ming Dynasty. That he was a warrior who had slain both man and beast alike. I know this all sounds crazy, but... The Keeper taught me all I needed to know about the Howlers. Where they lived, what they ate, and most of all, how to kill 'em. The Keeper chose me to be his hunter. - Why do you think he chose you? - Because I was driven by rage that no man was ever meant to have. I slaughtered over a hundred howlers. It became my obsession. I finally caught up to Price and his gang a couple years after. Right here, in this very town. I put an end to the reign of the demon wolf that night, or at least I thought I had. Buried them inside these coffins along with the scepter. - The scepter? - The scepter was given to me by the Keeper. It's a weapon, with mystical powers. It's even known for resurrecting the dead. Somehow it brought us all back here. Maybe by some sort of global shifting in the earth. That could explain your big storm. All I know is, I need to find this object because it is the only weapon that will stop the last breathing howlers. Still don't believe me. - Yeah well if you're asking if I believe you're a 150 year old gunslinger and werewolf hunter, no, I don't. Where were you all the time you were supposed to be dead? Were you in heaven? Hell? Do I look like an idiot to you? I'll tell you what I do think, I think these are a bunch of outlaw cop killers on the run. I think you're playin' us. That's what I think. Lock him up. I got bodies pilin' up on ice. I don't have time for this voodoo crap. - But sheriff, we saw them. - Ethan, just listen-- - Lock him up and take his weapons. - That's a very bad idea, sheriff. It's a full moon tonight. Howlers will feast. - Well, hell, I guess us ignorant folks at Temple Wells just have to lock our doors, aint that right? Get him out of here. - Yes, sir. - Walter? You take Lucy home. I've heard enough of this nonsense for one night. - Where you goin', Ethan? - Well I'm gonna put out an APB, doc. On werewolves, apparently. - He's havin', uh, woman troubles. - Come on, you wanna get some coffee goin'? Looks like we're gonna be in for one heck of a long night. Right this way. Yeah, it used to be a bank vault. Hey uh, listen. My partner and I really appreciate what you did for us back there and, well, I just wanna let you know if there's anything we can do while you're in here, then just let me know, okay? - Deputy? - No, Lucy cannot be here. The sheriff told you to take her home, Walt. - Well I tried, but, well she just wouldn't have it. - I've spent enough nights alone out in the middle of nowhere, and I don't intend to do it with monsters runnin' around. - For crying out loud, Walt. - Ethan? - Hi, dad. - Hey sweetheart, I'm sorry. It's wonderful to have you home. - You look stressed. - I'm sure I do, it's been a hell of a day. - What's going on? - A little trouble downtown. Sacks and Robertson are dead. - Oh my god, Ethan, what happened? - We're after some fugitives, and I found Burt Thompson dead by the river this morning. - And you're just now telling me this? Why didn't you call me? - Sweetheart, why don't you go upstairs and freshen up? I'll take you out for a beer. Go on. - Dad. Are you like in shock or something? You never let me drink alcohol in front of you. - Yeah well a lot of things are gonna change in this family. A lot of things already have, isn't that right, babe? - What are you talkin' about? - I'm gonna take a shower. - No, I'm not gonna do that. Look Lucy, let me make myself crystal clear with you. I saw whatever that thing was at the mill return to human form after it went down. Now, until the committee decides on what we're gonna do about this situation, I'm gonna do as I'm told. - The situation? Would you get your head out of your ass? Nine people are dead, two of them are your friends. - That's enough! Both of ya. You're acting like children. - All right guys, I think it's time for us to get out of here. - Yeah, that's a great idea. And Walter, I think you should go home as well. - Well if it's all the same, I just as soon stay here for a while. - Walter, not you too. All right then. All right look, I gotta go take a leak. Keep on eye on him, all right? - Okay. - You're startin' to believe that what I'm telling you is true, aren't you Walter? - Maybe. Let's uh, let's say there are werewolves. You know how to stop 'em right? - For now. - Well what's that supposed to mean, son? - It's a new time. They'll evolve, they'll multiply, they'll cast their curse upon others. It's gonna be harder and harder to stop 'em until one day, sooner rather than later, the world'll be covered in darkness. - You're just joshin' me. Aren't ya? - Get me out of here! - God. - Your God cannot save you now. Look at what he did to me. - Dammit. - Hey, wolf man! - You bitch. - Lucy. Get the key. Hey! - Are you okay? Are you okay? - Why is he out of his cell? Dammit. Terry, are you all right? - I'm fine. It's just a scratch. He didn't bite me. - You sure about that? - I'm sure. - I think it's safe to say desperate times call for desperate measures. We've been friends a long time and you're the sheriff of this town, so whatever you decide, I will support you. - All right, doc. How do we stop these things? - To stop 'em, you need to understand 'em. - All right, make me understand. - Ancient legends say the werewolf will only prowl at night under a full moon. Is that true? - Are you done? - What? I grew up on monster movies. - Go ahead. - A full moon gives 'em miraculous powers. But a howler can attack at any time during the day. Price knows I'm here. He's gonna come for me. We need weapons, and a place to dig in. Somewhere where we can see what's comin'. - I know a place. - You mean that house you just remodeled? Oh yeah, Karen's gonna be completely okay with that. - No, no, I'm not talking about my house. I'm talking about the mayor's. Anything else? - Yes. I need to learn how to ride a truck. - Drive a truck. You wanna learn to drive a truck. - Oh god, help us. - Ethan? Ethan. - What? - What are you doing? - Get Emily, get dressed, we're leavin'. - She's asleep. - Well wake her up, Karen. - Ethan, just tell me what's going on. - Dammit! How long, Karen? It's killing me inside. Of all the people you could've picked, Bob Barlow? You know what that son of bitch did to me? - A year, almost. - Jesus. - You and I, we were fighting a lot and we were both just working all the time. And Emily, she was, she was off just fighting her own life and... Ethan, I never meant-- - No. You don't get to say that. I don't know why people say that, "I never meant to hurt you." You've been banging the mayor of the town like a screen door. How do you think that's gonna make me feel? - Is that true? - You weren't supposed to hear that, baby. - Mom. So that explains a thing or two. - I'm sorry Em. I really messed things up. - Yeah, you sure did. - Now this, is a good lookin' truck. - This is a car.

You were never around, Ethan, you were married to your job then and I was lonely and we moved here, nothing got better. We're never gonna get past this, are we? You're never gonna forgive me. - It's just with me, there's some lines you don't cross. - If it's any consolation-- - It's not. - Mrs. Hardy. - You can cut the Miss Hardy crap, I need to see your boss. - Nobody walks past me. - Where is he? I'll find him. - You should've have moved. - Is this a bad time, Bob? - Well, shit. - Yeah. - I wish you'd have let me know you was comin'. You all right there, Princess? - Remind me again, Bob, how many years you get for illegal gun smuggling? It's a bunch, isn't it? - Yeah. - If I was you boys, I'd clear out before I change my mind. You deaf? - Why don't you boys take a run? Well. Ethan, Ethan, Ethan. Look, I know you've had a rough go of it as of late, you know, why don't we, why don't we just to take it down a notch, shall we? - Bob, you are sleeping with my wife. Using this town as a port to sell automatic weapons and you're asking me to take 'er down a notch, huh? You know the funny thing is, I've always known. Always known all about it, everything. I guess I just didn't wanna face it. I still don't, really. - Sugar, hand me a glass. You know, I mean, you bust in here, no search warrant. I mean this whole infidelity crap. I mean you really think that's appropriate to talk about in front of your wife? - Go to hell, Bob. - Now you see that? You see that kind of passion right there? Let me tell you about that passion here. Because that anger, and that passion, that's never directed a man that's slept with her. Now that kind of anger, that's only ever directed at man that's fucked her. Maybe that's your problem. Maybe you never fucked your wife. 'Cause you don't have any balls, do ya? You never had any. But you know what? Let's put all that aside, and why don't you tell me why the hell you're here. - Yeah, all right Bob. Here's the deal. As much as I'd love to bust your ass and put you behind bars, I can't believe I'm gonna say this but I think the best thing for both of us right now is to combine forces. - You wanna run that by me again? You uh, you want in? - No, no, nothin' like that. I'm saying it's your lucky day. I'm gonna turn a blind eye to all this illegal activity in your house. We got bigger problems. Much bigger problems. - Is that right? Why don't you give me a pinch in there, sugar? All right, you know what? Ethan, I'll bite. What kind of problems do we have? - Well the last 24 hours, a good portion of our town has been killed by a pack of predators. When I say predators, I mean werewolves. - Werewolves huh? - Yeah. Yep, that's right. Werewolves. Best I understand it, they've been extinct for 150 years but they've returned. Decided to feast on our little town. - Oh shit. What is this? Be honest. - I need your help, Bob. The town needs your help. These creatures are out for blood. This little sanctuary you've got here, might be the only way we all live through the night. And that's it. That's what I'm askin'. - I see, this is good. This is good right here. 'Cause I'm glad we've arrived at this point. 'Cause after all these years, Jesus Christ, you've finally lost it, haven't you? You see I thought you were gonna come here, and we're gonna settle this like gentlemen. But apparently I was wrong. Now sugar, I don't know what kinda game your trigger happy husband's here to play, but I assure you that shit ends right now. Tinkerbell. Why don't you do your job for a change and see the Hardys to the front door. - Unless you want my foot up your ass, you best steer clear of me. People are dead, Bob. Dead. I lost three of my deputies, and Walter. Walter was my friend. I'm not jokin'. - You need to listen to him, Bob. He's tellin' the truth. - See I like the tone change. I like the tone change a lot. I think I'll entertain your little delusions for a bit. But if I find you got ulteriors, it's not gonna end well for either one of ya, I assure ya. Are we clear? - Yeah. Okay, Bob. Fair enough. - Fuckin' werewolves. It has come to my attention that a series of murders has taken place here in Temple Wells. That good sheriff has informed me that the culprits are in fact some sort of werewolf type creature. I'm not sure I believe that crap, but, the town curfew stays in effect nonetheless. - All the weapons we have are loaded or laced with silver, the one and only way to kill a howler. One in the heart, or one in the head usually does the trick. Regular ammunition will slow 'em down, but it'll mostly just make 'em mad as a hornet. Any questions? - A few. Firstly, who the hell are ya, and what are you doing interrupting me? - The name's Colt. - Now see Colt, I'm the mayor of this town, you're a guest. So why don't you let me finish talkin' huh? - Apologies, Mr. Mayor. It's just we aint got much time. - Now what the hell makes you an expert on this situation anyway? - I've hunted these beasts, sir. I know how to defeat 'em. - You a drifter, aint ya? I've seen your kind before. - I'm no drifter, and I can assure you you've never seen my kind before. - What do you got sugar? - Uh, Mr. Mayor. Not that we don't believe that werewolves are coming to get us, but the thing is... - Our boss would be really pissed off if we're late again. We work at the Pussy Palace. - Really, Bob? - I'll take 'em. - No, no, no. No. I don't think that's a good idea. - We don't need to put anyone else in danger. - You come right back, you hear? - All right ladies, let's go. - Ethan. I think it's time you and I had a little conversation. - Sure, sure, let's talk Bob. Let's start by talkin' about Dallas. - Jesus Christ, Ethan. When are you gonna drop that shit? - I aint gonna drop that shit. You set me up. The drugs, the guns, they were yours. I took the fall. - What happened is-- - You let me. - I got you out of that crap. - You got me out of it? You told people I lost my fuckin' mind. - It worked. - For you. For you, it worked. - Is that what this is about, Ethan? Is it about revenge? Big old scary monsters roaming around Temple Wells? - What's the matter? You starting to get a little paranoid? Are you worried I might be tellin' the truth? - I could kick out each and every one of ya right now and I could strip your ass of that badge. - Yeah, yeah you could. And I'd burn this whole little dynasty you got to the ground. Try me. - Well. I honestly never thought I'd see the day when you'd threaten me, Ethan. - What's the matter, brother? You feelin' betrayed? It stings like a bitch, don't it? That's the damnedest thing about betrayal, Bob. Never comes from your enemies. What the? - Coffee? - Wow. This is the best damn coffee I've had in over a hundred years. - Well, I wish I could take the credit, but, we do have machines that make it for us now. - Of course you do. Seems like those stars are the only things that haven't changed in all this time. - Yeah. - I have a question I've been meaning to ask ya. - Shoot. I mean well not literally. - I know what you mean. What I wanted to ask you was, these clothes, you said they belonged to your husband. - He was a Marine. A soldier, he was killed in a war. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean-- - It's okay. I'm just still coming to terms with it. His name was Ray. He was very sweet, and, uh, very easy on the eyes. We had a lot of fun together. I miss that. I just, I guess I just couldn't bring myself to leave Temple Wells after he was gone, so. I guess my life really isn't that special. - I respectfully disagree. - Ray loved that gun. - Well you can have it back, I just-- - No, it's okay. I want you to have it. It belonged to a warrior, and now it belongs to another one. When I found you, there was something about you that reminded me of him a little and, I just knew that I had to help you. - What the hell am I lookin' at? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. You were gone for over an hour, where have you been? - Oh. - What happened? You were gonna take them back. - Something happened. - What? - This. - Oh, shit. - Bob! Shoot her! - Yeah! You bitch. - Shoot her Bob. - I'm sorry Ethan. You wanted it this way buddy. Oh! God! - Well hello there. - Ethan. - Dad? - Good God. Dear Lord in heaven, Ethan. - Doc. - Okay, um, Emily, I need you to go get some towels, some boiling water, and a knife. And check the bathroom for antiseptic. Go, go, go. Shh, shh. - No, I'm all right. - Ethan, be still. - I'll be all right. - No he won't. - We can handle this son. - He's got the blood of a wolf inside him now. Just a matter of time before he turns. - No, I don't believe that. - It could take minutes, hours, or days. Without the healing powers of the scepter, it's bound to happen. - Colt. What is that? Let's get him downstairs. - What are you gonna do? - Don't worry about me just you guys go. Go ahead. - Come on baby. - Come on. Come on. - Emily. Emily. - Dad, don't talk. Mom, just take him. - Emily, what are you gonna do? - Mom, go. - Come on, Karen, time's a-wastin'. - Hey it's me. I need you to get the plane ready. I need to get out of town, lay low for a bit. - Do you have any idea what time it is? - Yeah I know what goddamn time it is. You wake his ass up. No idea that shit I've been through tonight. Goddammit. - You want me to grab the boys and make a haul? - No. Business as usual. And you tell the runners to take the back road you-- Hold the line. Hurry up, you hear me? Hurry that shit up! - It's yours, brothers! Come on out, Colt! We know you're in there. You got a lot of innocent people killed, slick. Their blood's on your hands. How's it feel knowin' you're gonna die tonight? - I don't know. The night's still young. - When death took you, where did you go? I mean, what did you see? The Afterworld's just no place for a man. So tell me, what else is out there beyond the borders? - Let's just say that where you're goin' and where I'm goin', two very different places. So you better pucker up sweet cakes. - Oh I'm gonna miss that quick tongue of yours. Kill him. - Wait. There's a man inside. He's gonna die without the scepter. I'm willing to trade my life for his. - What makes you think I have it with me? - 'Cause I know you Willie. You wouldn't let it out of your sight. - You're right. I do have it. But there's one little problem. You've got nothin' left to bargain with. Now mow him down! Let's get 'em! - Doc! - Damn Lucy. You scared the holy hell out of me. We need to get Ethan to the hospital. - Woo. That is one dirty, sick little werewolf, isn't he? - Nice job, Mr. Mayor. - Hey, you know, don't thank me too soon. - What the hell Bob? - As far as I can tell, well these things aint after you and me. They're after you, hotshot, aint that right? What say you and me take little walk outside? I hand you over, and then the good folks of this town can go night-night. And me, well, I'll live to see me another election cycle, you like that? - They'll kill you. - Oh I can take care of myself, I assure you that. Why don't you sit down and watch a man work. I've been a cop over 15 years. I've taken down rapists, thugs, murderers. Hell you know somethin', I've even taken down the odd politician, you know that? What is that smell? - Hey. Are you all right? - Yeah. I'm okay. - I'm sorry I got you involved in all this. - Well we're in this together now, right? - Come on. - Hawkins aint comin' out, Willie. Why don't we storm in there and take 'em all out? I don't mean no disrespect, but why are we playing these games? - Well Morgan, that's why I've always been in charge of this gang instead of you. - First light's coming up, Wilie. What are we gonna do? - Let's ride! - Lucy. It's time for you to get out now. - Colt-- - Lucy. Go. - Be careful. - You're mine, skinner. - Come out Willie! - Do you recognize these? Of course you do. Oh, come on now Colt. Don't tell me you're gonna quit because of a couple cuts. I mean, even your wife put up a bigger fight than that. Good bye, Colt. You fool. You know the scepter's the only thing that can kill the last howler. - You're not the last howler. - I'm sorry. I didn't want this for you. - Chris Ray reporting live from the small southern town of Temple Wells where a strong of grizzly attacks happened.
