Damn it. Hello? Is someone there? Goddamn it. You can't talk right now. You can't even breathe. You shouldn't curse, young lady. Don't curse unless you want to be cursed. It's a sin, you know. Cursing. Do you know about sin, Ella? Go ahead and breathe. How do you know my name? I know loads of things. Hey. Want to hear something really interesting? It's about your fucking daddy! Goddamn nightmares. Violent or upsetting dreams are merely the mind's attempt to release the pressures of our daily thoughts and fears. As you learn to meditate, you will discover your mind is very difficult to silence. If you try to stop your thoughts or prevent them from entering your mind, you will only create conflict when you are trying to achieve pea... Somebody wants you. Who? I have absolutely no idea. I'm so awake. You need to get in the pool. Excuse me. Josh is an idiot. No argument there. Will you pick up Ella today? I will pick up Ella anytime, anywhere. Thank you. And tomorrow. I'm working. I thought I was coming to see you. Really? Okay. Great. I'll ask Lena. Okay. Old man. Sunblock. Bye. Oh, my God, that's... That's so... This is a situation that cannot last. One! Two! Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight, nine, ten! Ready or not, here we come. Where could she possibly be? There you are! All right, all right. That was good. And you're... her dad? Husband. Well, there's nothing on the call sheet, and it's a closed set. I'm her husband. It's a closed set. I'm her husband. Rolling! - Rolling! - Rolling! I'm three feet away from you. Yeah. Rolling. Yeah, okay. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Cut! - And that's a cut! - I have her latte. - Oh, yeah, come on in, man. - Um, he's... - How you doing, man? - You good? - Yeah, living the dream. Uh, maybe you could just ask somebody if she's... - Going again. - Going again! Right away! Rolling! Okay. - And cut! - Cut! Turning around on her! What the fuck does that mean? All right, I'm sorry, man, okay? Look, I'll put a call through on the radio. Yeah? What was your name again? Theo Conroy. Yeah, I got a Theo... Conroy. Yeah, Theo Conroy here to see Susie. - I totally got you. - You did. You got me. It was excellent, man. It was really good. - Thanks. - Hey, so 6:00 a.m. tomorrow. - Yep. - And, uh, I sent you the script for my short, so... Oh, that's nice. Thank you. - All right, I'll see you later. - Later. There you are. - Hi. - Hi. Mm. I'm sorry about that scene. It was too much, right? I mean, it felt almost porny. Josh is such a perv. He gave me this whole thing about how the female orgasm is never represented in American film. I just think he wanted to see me naked. I think he shot it beautifully, though. Uh-huh. What? So the guy, you know, that stopped me, the one with the walkie-talkie thing... Oh, God, I'm sorry. I definitely... I told him you were coming. No, it's not that. He recognized me. I'm sorry. That sucks. Ah, I should be used to it by now. They think you're dangerous. You're not supposed to like it. I'm not supposed to do a lot of things. You want to have me in the car? Ooh. Oh, God, it felt so good not to fake it. I hated being there today. I forgot it was today. Hearing that was like a knife in my brain. I'm so sorry. If I don't get you out of here for a while, I think I'm going to go nuts. Let's just go. - Where? - Anywhere. Away from here. Well, I've got a few weeks before I start shooting in London. Okay. Over there, we'll go early. We'll get a place in the country just you and me and Ella. It's so good when it's just the three of us. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I think you're done. Sorry. - I'm greedy. - Mm. I'm not gonna do these kinds of parts anymore. That's not realistic. You're rich and retired. I'll live off of you. You don't mean that. I pretend. It's my job. I'm working on the jealous thing. I really am. I'm writing in the journal. I meditate. I do the app. I love you so much. Then come away with me. - You're left. - No, I'm not. Uh... honey, I think you're left. If I had been any further right, I would have hit that guy. You're doing great. Do you want to drive? No, no, no, I mean it. Yeah, so do I. - Please, drive. - I'm too old to flip my brain. You got this. Daddy, because you're old, you'll die before Mommy, right? Hey. Hey, hey. I'm not that old. But you will die first, right? Not if I can help it. Uh, the thing is, sweetie, nobody really knows when anybody's gonna die. Doesn't matter how old you are. Why do we have to die at all? Because life is not survivable. Really? That-that's what you came up with? Sorry. Shit. I love your dark side, but she's six years old. I got it. Can you tell her about Heaven next time? You can't sell what you don't believe. I do it all the time. Honey, that's a sheepgate. Pretty cool! That's funny. I hate you. Is that our new house? Wow! It's so beautiful! I love it! Wow. For once, reality is actually better than the pictures online. It doesn't suck. Wow. Seems bigger on the inside. Oh, my God. Way bigger. I love this. No service, though. Oh, well. Oh, God. Wait. - What? - Listen. The quiet. ♪ La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ - ♪ La-la! ♪ - Well, not anymore. - Got anything down there? - One bar. Uh, nope. Not anymore. Oh, cool. Weird design. Oh, maybe upstairs it's better. Sorry to obsess. They're calling me about the schedule for London. Not a problem. Whoa. Boy, they really got rid of everything personal. They even took down the pictures. Other people's families are depressing. And creepy. And a jump. I'm jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping... Hey. Get over here! I didn't give you a very good answer to your question before, did I? No, Baba. It was very disappointing. Okay, here's the thing. I don't plan on dying for a really long time, but when I finally do and when Mommy does and when you do, too, we're all gonna be together again. In Heaven. Are you sure? That's what they say. Does everyone go to Heaven? - Uh... - Oh, my God, Ella, you have to come up here. Your bed is the size of Connecticut. What?! Mom, let me see, let me see. I want to jump on it! Oh, my God, I love it! It's amazing! Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet. ♪ Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet. ♪ Mm... Huh? Ella. Hey. You got to get to sleep, sweetie. But there was a shadow on the wall. I know it's fun, but it's time to sleep. Okay. Come on. Scooch down, scooch down. All the way. Grab Bunny. Okay. Good night. Can you turn off the lights for me, please? - Off? - Yes. - You sure? - Yes. Okay. - Good night, honey. - Good night, Baba. Honey, what's the name of the owner again? Stetler or Statler. You ever talk to him? No, just e-mail. I have his number, though. Why? Oh, thermostat's broken downstairs. It's gonna be cold tonight. - Upstairs okay? - Yeah. Can you call him tomorrow? Can you? Uh, yeah, I mean, I-I could, but you booked it under your name, right? Yeah, of course I did. I'm sorry. I-I know I'm a pain in the ass. Nobody would know you here. You would be surprised. Okay. I just don't want to deal with all the weirdness. Okay, I totally get it. Hey. I need to tell you something. I downloaded all of season three before we left. I adore you. Can we watch the recap first? Have I ever denied you the recap? I'm gonna close up downstairs. You do that. Oh. Hi, honey. How much did I say? Nothing. Totally innocuous. Guess that one stays on. Jesus. You got enough switches? Previously on Credible Threat... Hmm. So, as it turns out, there's this whole other hallway right underneath the stairs. Really? Oh, come on, you can't be asleep yet. Honey. Whoa. It's okay. It's okay. Shh. You okay? What's going on? I had the worst dream. Yeah? Already? What happened to you? I was turning off the lights. How long? An important aspect of your work in the program is your daily journal. Take a moment, and clearly assess your physical and emotional state using one-word descriptors. Okay. Okay. Careful. You know what? Please don't go too high. How do I feel? What do I feel? Can you come down, please? Ella, that is too high. Ella. Ella, please don't ignore me. Why do people hate Daddy so much? What? Why do they hate him? Why-why would you say that? 'Cause they do. Come down, please. I've heard you guys talking. That's eavesdropping. Come down, please. I bet I can stand up. - Don't. No, no, no, no, no. - I'm doing it. Don't stand up, please. - I'm doing it. Look. - Ella. Ella. Are you okay? Ella, are you sure you're okay? Yeah. Why do people hate Baba so much? You know that... that your dad, um, was married before he and I met, right? Mm-hmm. His wife's name was Caroline. And she died? Well, the thing is... the thing is, um, how she died. She died in the bathtub? Yeah, yeah, she drowned in the bathtub. Why didn't she just sit up? Uh, well, she couldn't. Why not? Should we go back? No. She couldn't get up, because she was sleeping. That doesn't make sense. Sometimes grown-ups take medicine. Sometimes they take too much medicine or they take the wrong kind of medicine, a kind that they shouldn't ever have taken at all. And if they do, they can fall asleep so hard that they can't wake up. So, Daddy came home from work one day, and she was in the bathtub. And, uh... she had already passed away. There was nothing he could do. It was an accident. The thing is, they thought he-he put her in the tub. Did they... did they think that Daddy killed her? Yeah. Did he? Did Daddy kill her? No. No. Okay. Why didn't he just tell them he didn't do it? Well, he did, and they just didn't believe him. And because Daddy was a rich banker, lots of people were interested in his trial. And when it went to trial, he was on TV, and he got sort of famous. What happened at the trial? The judge and the jury all found him innocent, and they said he could go home and start a new life, but some people didn't want to let him. Some people think that if you're accused, you must be guilty of something. Hello. Hello. Oh. Hi. Good morning. Uh, afternoon. Uh... yeah. Let's see. I-I need some, uh... butter, bread. Oh. Great. Great. Yeah, uh, bread, egg... Okay. Oh, good. Here comes the bread. Mm-hmm. And eggs. Got to be kidding me. Looks like we got everything. You staying up there? I'm so sorry. I don't speak Welsh. It's English. - Oh. - You... staying... up there? Uh, yeah. Oh. Uh-huh. Anything happened yet? Excuse me? You meet Stetler? Is that, uh... that's the... that's the owner, right? Stetler. Uh, no, hmm-mm. Found it on the Internet. - Oh. - Yeah. The house is... fairly new, it seems like? - About four years. - Hmm. What was there before? Another house. Makes sense. House, then a house. Then a house, then a house, then a house. - 26 quid. - Great. 26... There you go. Change? Credit. Okay, yeah. I guess we're gonna be here a while. Present for you. Try the right angles. Will do. Oh, come on. Hi. Excuse me. - How'd you find the house? - On the Internet. No, I never met Stetler. - I need to... - You never saw Stetler? No. Well, he saw you. Enough with the Stetler. Hey, I'm back. Hey. Sorry that happened to you, Baba. Shit. Walk me through exactly what you told her. I did. Tell me again. I can't remember word for word. But I said the stuff that we talked about saying, when the time came. And you just decided that the time had come. I didn't plan it, actually. She asked, and she wouldn't let it go. You know how she is. She gave me that look where she doesn't blink. It's creepy. It was my story. It happened to me, and I knew exactly what I wanted to say to her when it was time. Right, and it was time, okay? I couldn't lie to her. When she was seven... that's what we decided. That is a completely arbitrary number. She obviously overheard us last night. She asked me point-blank. That's how it happened, huh? Yeah, that's... - that is how it happened, yeah. - Mm-hmm. What does that mean? I don't know. You know, it's just... sometimes it's hard to tell what's real with you. That's all. Excuse me? You're just a really good actress. That's all I'm saying. And you're a passive-aggressive dick, is all I'm saying. I got to make dinner. That supposed to be meat? Think there's a lot of options down there in the village of the damned? No olives? You chose this place, not me. No, I didn't. You sent me the link. I absolutely did not. You sent it to me. All right, can... can we please stop? Who would have imagined that they don't have the Whole Foods olive bar in Wales? Let me know when you're done being an asshole. Yeah. Go get on your phone. Thank you, Ella. You're welcome, Baba. Look. Cool. Thanks. Honey, uh... - do you need shampoo? - What? Shampoo. Uh, do you need any shampoo? I have some. Oh, okay, so... so you are washing your hair. Huh? Nothing. Not... not important. Honey, I can't hear anything that you're saying. You can talk, but you come in here. No, never mind. Was there enough, uh, hot water? What are you doing? Never mind. All good. I'm done. With what? Being an asshole. You know, I've-I've had this cloud that's been hanging over me for a while now, and I've just been an idiot about it. But I'm done with all that now. It was... it was stupid. I'm sorry. About Ella? Yeah. Yeah, you handled it... just right, sounds like. B-Better than I could've. You should've seen the way she looked at me after dinner. She loves her Baba. I'm really sorry for thinking ill of you. It was a sin. I regret it. Catholic school fucked you up good. Yeah. That was a half-decent apology. Thank you. - You okay? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm good, honey. Just go back to sleep. Okay. The clear expression of your thoughts and feelings is essential to any relationship. Emotional truth is the only pathway to peace. Suspicion and mistrust are merely impulses of energy, and they are not always under your control. Then again, sometimes those feelings are based in fact. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello. Okay. Okay, no, no. This can't be happening. No, this is definitely not happening. Ella? Oh, my God. Ella! Oh! Oh, my God! Ella! No. Ella. Oh, God. Oh, my God. No. Oh, God. Oh... Oh, God. Honey, honey. Wake up, wake up. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Oh! Oh! You're dreaming. Dreaming. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! It's a dream. It's a dream! It's a goddamn dream! Fucking nightmares. Oh, boy. I just had a really bad dream. Oh, yeah? I was onstage, and I... there was a huge audience, and I didn't even know the play. Like, I didn't have a clue. I hate those dreams. I think I got you beat. Oh, it's really nice in here. Okay, that's encouraging. Two doors. What, last night there were three? Yeah, there was another one right behind this bookshelf here. Went to this staircase, and then-then there was this weird kind of hall that went around and led to a place... under the house. And Ella... God, it was horrible. What's behind this door? This is where the washer is. God, this is a gigantic laundry room. This is it right here from the dream. Oh, sure, that's a bummer. Okay, so, um, you saw the picture, and then you put it all in your dream. Okay, okay, but-but at what point did I actually fall asleep? Immediately after sex, like always. You did. You did. You don't remember me getting up and leaving the bedroom? Hmm-mm. I don't know. I don't think so. Mm, no. I don't think so. I would've woken up. You're not very good at sneaking around. So everything from the time I got out of bed was a dream. Sounds like it. And I never went downstairs? Nope. Do you like it here? In this room? This house. No. Do you? I hate it. But we just got here. I know, but sometimes when you pick something online, you don't really know what you're getting, and you make a mistake. It happens. Where are we gonna go now? Hotel for a little while, someplace really fun. The important thing is that we'll all be together before I have to start work and you and your dad go home. But how long will you be gone? Eight weeks. That's a really long time. I know, but you and your dad are gonna come visit halfway through, like we talked about. Why can't we just be with you the whole time? Let's just go outside and run around before we have to get in the car. Seven, eight, nine, ten, here I come! Darn it. I didn't dream that. Got you! You're so slippery! Hey. Hi, Baba. Susanna, come here a sec. - What is it? - Come play with us. I want to talk to Mommy first. Baba can be weird sometimes. - Ella, go inside. - Why? Because it's gonna rain. You ready to go? What is it? You have two phones. Must have been a lot of work keeping track of two of those things. Yeah, it's exhausting. The guy, Max, from the shoot in Mexico? Yeah. That's too bad. Has he been here, in this house? Of course... of course not. Because somebody wrote in my journal. He's not here. He's in New York. He has meetings. I don't give a shit where Max has meetings. I'm sorry. So, who wrote in my book? Um, I don't know. Uh, did Ella? Is that the biggest problem we have right now? I bet that guy can fuck you all night, huh? Don't make it ugly. I'm 100% sure that I am not the one that made this ugly. I can't do this. If only you'd said that to Max. You know, it'd feel a lot better if you yelled and screamed like a normal person. No, thanks. You got to go. What? Where? I don't know. Not here. Stay in the village. I'm not staying in the fucking village. - You go if you want to. - No, you leave. Fine. I'll take Ella. Like hell you will. You-you're not making the rules now. You broke the rules. There are no rules anymore. Other side. How long am I supposed to stay in purgatory? I just need a night to myself. - So do you. - Don't tell me what I need. A night by yourself. Yes, Theo, I get it... by myself. Max is not here. He has never been here. Oh, right, 'cause of all the big meetings in New York. Can I get in, please? Hey, listen, um, you know, I want to take back that "fuck you all night" thing I said. - Yeah, whatever. - Yeah, let me be clear... I don't actually care who fucks you all night. - Oh, my God. Jesus. - I'm sure it's quite a list. Drive safe, sweetie. Hey, do you have both your phones? They didn't have any peanut butter. - Why not? - It's not a thing here. - So, what's that stuff? - I don't know. Starts with L. Well, two L's, actually. I don't want it. - It's pretty good. - No, it isn't. Okay, it's not pretty good. It tastes kind of weird. But it's not poison, and it's what we have. - I'm not eating it. - Could you please just stop with the scooter for one second, honey? So you might as well just throw it in the garbage can for me because I'm just not gonna eat it. Honey, could you please get off the scooter? I'm sorry. Sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Honey, it's okay. I don't like it here. I don't think I do, either. I have weird dreams, and I get in bad moods. Me, too. Did you and Mommy have a fight? Yeah. Today is a terrible day. - I want to go home. - So do I. As soon as Mom gets back with the car, okay? - When will that be? - Tomorrow. Hmm. Huh. - What are you doing? - Experiment. - What kind of experiment? - Water experiment. That's freaky. I'll say. What's that? It's a triangle. I'm checking the angles. Why you want to check angles? These are all very heads-up questions, honey. Huh. Does this wall look right to you? Um... it looks like a wall to me. Can't tell from in here. What are you looking for? I don't know. 16, seven, 12, zero. Honey, honey, honey. You taught me that. 16! 17! 18! - Okay, you got me. - One! Yay! - Hang on tight, honey. - Okay. - Don't let go. - Okay. 26 feet. - Hold on tight. - Okay. 21. Are you at the corner? - Yeah. - You sure? Yeah. You can let go. What does it say? Says this room is five feet longer on the inside than it is on the outside. Wait. How does that work? It doesn't. I'm cold. Get your coat on, hon. Okay. Ella? Ella. Ella. So not in the mood for hide-and-seek. Ella! Ella. I give up, honey. You win. Ella. Ella? Okay, Ella, it's not funny. Come out, please. Baba? Baba. Ella. What the hell? Baba? Are you there? Baba? Ella? Oh, God. Hello? Is anybody down here? I got lost. Hello? Who are you? Can you hear me? Are you okay? Ella. What an innocent face. We don't get that much here. Such a lucky daddy. I bet you'd stay with him forever, wouldn't you? - Ella! - Baba! Daddy, where are you? Ella? - Ella! - Baba, I'm scared. Stay back from the door! Baba, please, please. Baba! Oh, Jesus. Ella. Honey, are you okay? - I got... I got lost. - Oh, baby. I got lost in the house. I know. I know. I got you now. - I was looking for you everywhere. - I know. I know, my love. It's okay. It's okay. - I was scared. - I know. I know. - I got you. - I couldn't find you. I got you now. You're okay now. All right? You and me, we're not getting out of each other's sight again. All right? That's a deal. I want to go home. We will. - Promise? - Yeah. Yep. Yeah. I promise. - I'm just gonna call... - Wait! Okay, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just gonna call your mom, and she's gonna come right now, and she's gonna pick us up, okay? Hey, it's me. Um, leave me a message. Her phone is off or she's out of range. Why don't you call her other phone? Uh... I don't have that number. Oh. All right, I-I'm gonna try her again. Hey, it's me. Um, leave me a message. Hey, uh, it's me. Call me when you get this, as soon as you get it. Uh, okay. This is not a problem. Okay. All right, yeah, it's a... it's a little bit of a problem. But I got an idea. Aha! All right. We are out of here. We are so out of here. They don't answer? Uh, just give him a minute. This guy's kind of slow. Hello. Hello. Hi. Uh, this is Theo Conroy. I was in the other day. Uh, we-we rented the house u-up the hill. Where? Stetler. The Stetler house. We rented Stetler's house. I remember. - We need a taxi. - A what? A taxi. W-We need somebody to come pick us up. There are no taxis around here. Well, where, then? Marlborough Inn, maybe. Unless he's still on holiday. Okay, uh, could you give me that number, please? Hello? Did you try the triangle? Yes. I tried the triangle. They never fit the angles up there. Why not? What is this place? Somebody from here, Hans Eagly, he owns the Lindenhof. He said an ant doesn't know what a cathedral is or a power plant or a volcano. It's the same with that house. You don't know what you can't know. Are you still there? We need a taxi now. Don't shout at me. I'm not... shouting. There was a different house before that one. What sort of house? Just different. And before that, a tower. Tower? It's a legend. The Devil builds a tower to collect souls, and God destroys it. But the Devil just builds it up again and again. People have always stayed in that house. Some don't leave. The right ones usually find the place. Or perhaps it's the other way around. The place finds them. We need to leave now. That's not up to me. Hello? Hello! I'm here. I'm always here. - How far is the village? - It's pretty far. It's about four miles. But it's dark. - Yep. - And cold. Would you rather stay here? - No. - Me, neither. - But what about our stuff? - We'll get new stuff. Oh, no. Why don't you unlock the door? Are you sure you know the way? Yep. Just one road, right down straight into town. There's somebody inside the house. Okay, up. Baba, what's happening? Let's go. - I'm cold. - I know. It's cold, but we're okay. I can walk. I got you, honey. I got you. It's freezing. Hey. You're doing great. Honey, I-I got to put you down, okay? Okay. Are you sure you know where we're going? Yeah. Just one road, right into town. What was that? - What was that? - Uh, it was nothing, honey. It was just an animal, animal. - Okay. - Just a-a deer, something. Okay, up you go. Almost there, honey. Not much further. I can't... I can't feel my toes. Maybe they'll have a fire. I've never been this c-cold before. You never lived in Chicago. How much farther is it? I'm starting to see lights. It's... cold. Yeah. I'm definitely seeing some lights. We made it. We did it. We did it, honey. We're there. We're... We're back. What? We're back. But... But we were going down the whole time. I'll explain it to you in the morning. - It's complicated. - No, it isn't. We were walking d-down the whole time. I don't want to go in there. We don't have a choice. I'm not going in there. - Honey... - I hate that house! - It's too cold out here, honey. - No. No! Your mom's gonna be here in the morning with the car. Please don't make me go in there. Listen to me. We would not make it out here. Not all night. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? I will protect you. I'm gonna make sure... that nothing happens to you. I'm gonna protect you. Okay? Do you trust me? I-I trust you. One more night. Just one more night. We can do it. Okay? Let's go. Let's go. Okay? Feeling better? It's warm now, right? I'm not going anywhere. Just try and get some sleep, honey. Daddy? Yes, my love. You still love Mommy? Yeah. I do. But not enough? Well, s-sweetie, uh... I never really deserved to have your mom. What about me? What about you? Do you love me enough? Aw. You know... when I was young... things came pretty easy for me, and-and-and really quick, like, success and money. Stuff like that. And I think I... I kind of lost track of who I was, you know, and... I became someone that I wasn't really proud of. Everything in my life just... just came too easy and too quick. Except for you. The one thing that mattered. For you, I had to wait. Until you were old? Hey, lady, I'm not that old. I love you much more than enough. I love you, Baba. Ella! Ella. Ella! Baba! Ella? Ella. Ella! Ella! Wow. Seems bigger on the inside. - Oh, my God. - Way bigger. Oh, I love it. There's no service, though. - You hear that? - Hey! What? - Hey! - The quiet. Baba! Hello. You're not going anywhere. Hey, I'm back. Hey. Sorry that happened to you, Baba. Does everyone go to Heaven? That's what they say. Where are you? Oh, my God, Ella, you have to come up here. Your bed is the size of... Ella. Ella. Ella. Where are you? Susanna? Susanna! Wow. Seems bigger on the inside. - Oh, my God. - Way bigger. Your name Stetler? I got a lot of names. Where's Ella? A lot of faces. And a lot of houses. Been a room here for you for a long time. - Where is she? - Where you belong. With me. Baba! In here! Baba, I'm scared! I'm here! - Ella! Ella! - Please find me. Please find me. Ella. Ella. It's hot in here! Let her go. Such a lucky daddy. She would do anything for you. Let her go, you son of a bitch. She'd even stay. Let her go. Let her go! Think of it. Together forever. Just you and her... and a lie. She's innocent. Sure she is. But she's with you. I didn't do it! I didn't do it! Daddy, I don't know where I am! Baba, please, please! Let her go! The sins of the fathers... I didn't do it! ...come down on the kids. But I... didn't... do it! That's the problem with mirrors. They always show you yourself. Please. Please let her go. Please let her go. Please, please, please, please. Me? The only one keeping her here is you. I can't do it. I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do it anymore. I can't. I can't do this. I-I can't do it. I can't do this. Then you know what you've got to do, don't you? Baba? Oh... Ella. Oh, honey. Oh, I am so sorry. Ella, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. What for? For... not being what you think I am. But... I love you no matter what. Don't you know that yet? Is it time to go home? It is, for you and Mommy. Come on. Hi, Mommy. Where is her stuff? I'll send it. Later. You're not coming with us? It'll never let me. I'd end up right back here. And if you were with me, you would, too. I belong here. Can we just try and work through it? I love you. I love you so much. But... I always knew that you were only borrowed. Stop talking crazy. Just get in the car, and we can talk about it. I killed her, Suse. I let her drown. I could've pulled her out, and I didn't. I watched her die. All those years being so angry, hating her so much, and... keeping it inside. I should've left... ...years before. But I didn't. I belong... right here. Can't run away from your shadow. There's somebody inside the house. Baba, what's happening? Let's go. People have always stayed in that house. Some don't leave. The right ones usually find the place. Or maybe it's the other way around. The place finds them.
