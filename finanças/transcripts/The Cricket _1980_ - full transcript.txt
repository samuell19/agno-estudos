THE CRICKET Here I am, Father. I came as I said. You did the right thing. Please take a sit there. Mrs. Vina complained about you and she's always been so nice with you! She said that you are crazy! I stayed at the hospital only two days! The doctor said that if all women who want to have sex should go to hospital, it would be... oh, I am sorry. How come you can't stop causing all these troubles? I tried to mess up my hair, and even to scratch my face! Men follow me anyway. You know what, Father? Would you like to know the truth? I like to make love! For example, tonight... Girl, you are not confessing yourself! I'm sorry. You should calm down. Find a job. I wish! Nobody gives me a job! I have no references. I don't even know who my parents were! You shouldn't care about it! You have to promise me you'll behave like... Promise me you'll behave! Especially in these days! Try! Go now. Go! Bye! Bye. Thank you! Nobody came to pick me up! I'll teach them how to treat an International showgirl! You are working as a body guard, uh? I promised the Priest Tell us, Ermete, did you ask her out? You silly! She is a wild cat! You are right Ermete! She goes out only with whom she likes. Where are you going now? I'm finished here. I'm going to clean the bedrooms. Then? Who knows. Maybe I'll sleep! It never happened to me! Damn! I've never seen someone treating an artist like that! Leave it there. I'll talk to my agent! - You are an artist! - Yes! Wilma Malinverni. Known as Malene. Nice, isn't it? You are nice too. Call me Malene! How can I do it? You are an artist! You traveled around the world! More or less. Do I have to prepare you a bath, Mrs. Malinverni? Call me Wilma! Yes, Madame! Do you always sing? Like a cricket, isn't it? Yes! Everybody calls me Cricket! Bravo! I like you like that! If you promise me you won't lose weight, I'll give you the main event! I didn't know I had to use my bottom! I never ask my girls out. But I'd like to make an exception with you! You, get out! And close the door! Madame, if you need me... call me, okay? Wilma! Wilma! Love, my love! Bring me many roses! Even tonight, tell me many things! Stupid! Assholes! Stop! You are destroying my bar! Stop! Stop! You and your friend are fired! Go out! Go out! Cricket! Do you have wings under your feet? You guessed right! Even the gipsys who taught me to dance told me so. - Try to fly Wilma! - Sure! With my big bottom! Stop darling! Wait a moment! I can't go on. I can't! Listen, I'm bothering you. I will look for a job. Cricket, we are two and two will be! There's always a last opportunity. Where can we find this opportunity? Good evening. Good evening. The Cricket? You know how difficult it was to have a respectable hotel. Ask people about Villa Bruna. What are we going to do? Where will this nice girl sleep? With me. You are a couple! Why didn't you tell me that you are working together? You misunderstood. I'm the one who works here, darling. We'll see. No! No! I'm not going to be a prostitute! Making love while people are looking at you?! Or watching while people make love?! I can't even think about it! Don't worry. I'll do it for both of us. Did you understand, Cricket? You don't need to worry. You are too good! Don't be silly, don't cry! I love you! I love you so much! Don't cry. Otherwise I'll start crying too. We'll be out of here quickly. Together? Always together! Calm down. Do you know what my former manager Bertazzoni told me once? Dear Wilma, life has changed. People want something new. But this one, darling, is always fashionable! They will search for me again. You know, I can read the hand! Oh come on! Yes! Let me see. What did you see? Nothing. Tell me! I don't believe it anyway! Nothing, really. Yes, you saw something. Let's go swimming! Madame, you've been recognized. You are Wilma Malene. So? The manager asked if you could sing something. Give me an E, Maestro. I'll sing "ll soldato innamorato". Stay away from this heart, and my thought goes to you, Look who's here! Hi! How are you? Do you like her? Nice, nice! I'm sure about this love, as I'm sure about you! Life, my life! Heart, this heart! You've been my first love, you'll be the first and the only for me! Life, my life! Heart, this heart! You've been my first love, you'll be the first and only for me! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! I didn't know you were so good! Oh, I'm sorry. Hello. I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm Annibale Meneghetti. I was wondering if I could have the honour... The honour of sitting at your table. Sure, please! Thank you! That's nice of you! Wilma Malena. Nice to meet you! She's a friend of mine! - Hello! - Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you. Oh dear Professor! Come here! You've been great! - Congratulations! - Thank you, Professor. How are you? Do you remember our show? Great period! What do you do now? Are you still playing? No, my dear Wilma. I live here, I don't go anywhere. I'm retired, I'm old now. - Oh come on! - How can you live with memories? You are such a wonderful woman! Come on, don't be sad! I'll take you for a drink in a place l know. Come on! He is right. Go, go. Bye, Professor. - Excuse me. - Yes? Why people call you Ulisse when you said your name is Annibale? We all have a nickname here. I'm called like that because I used to be a salesman. I was like Ulisse, I was not able to return home. Now I'm retired. You know what I do now? - No. - I'll show you the most beautiful thing of my life! It's a big thing! When they had finished building it, the company went bankrupt. I bought it. It was cheap. It was a good business. Nice, isn't it? It could be nice, but I can't see it. I apologize. I'm going to put some light on. Where are we, darling? - Wow! - That's great! How beautiful! Come on! Should I pick you up? - Let's go! - Yes, we're coming! This is the bar. I have the authorization for alcohol and cigarettes. This is the restaurant for dinners and weddings parties. Here there's the kitchen with all you need. We can cook 250 dishes. The first floor have 12 bedrooms with hot and cold water. Look, there's also the billiards room. How nice! Every time I come here, I feel sad that nothing is working. The restaurant! Where? Why isn't it working? Do you really want to know it? It's such a pity to see everything abandoned. Yeah, you are right. What could I do? I need... I would need a woman! Your wife doesn't help you, does she? My wife? What wife... I don't have one. I don't have one. Why don't you get married? What are you laughing at? Why not? We should talk about it. No, Ulisse. Too much memories in my life... Too many mistakes. Miss Malene, tell me the truth. How come you don't like my building? It's beautiful, you know that! Well, then it means you don't like me. Don't be silly, Ulisse! Then why Wilma? Tell me why not. A 42 year old lady... 42 years old... I'm more than fifty; so? I'm no a young boy anymore. As you don't understand it, I'll tell you the reason. I... I have a 17 years old daughter, without a husband. I didn't know it. So? It's not finished here. The story... the story is long. Malinverni. Wilma Malinverni. Mrs Meneghetti. Let's make a toast to this couple! Hurrah! Cricket! Cricket! Cheers! Cricket, give me a kiss! Now a big applause to the person who did this. Ovidio! Come Ovidio! Ovidio! Bravo! Hurrah for the couple! Taste it, it's so good! Wow, you are so refined! Congratulations Wilma. Would you have married a bitch? I married a virgin. First she cheated on me, then she ran away with a dude! Here you go. Let's make smaller pieces or - it won't be enough for everybody. - Ulisse! How will we call it? What's the name of this building? You are right, you are right! It's true. We have to put outside the sign with the name. You're right! Congratulations Ulisse! - Congratulations! - Thank you, thank you! Thank you! Congratulations Wilma. Mrs, I'm here for the cake. Of course! What name could we choose? I have no idea. We need a nice name. You are Ulisse, call it Odissea! No! No! As your real name is Annibale, call it Cardace. Wait a minute... You gave us the idea! I found it! I found it! THE CRICKET Game 42, 8, 50. You win again! Why do you always lose with me? Because you never work! You have also Wilma for the night. Lucky you! I'll get it. I'll tell Wilma! If it's not her, it's the other one, isn't it? They both serve you! Why don't you find a woman too? But first be sure she has a good driving license. It's so hot! Turn around! All right, all right! He looks... You are still here?! It seems you didn't get it off. Here you have, Saint Thomas! Ten thousand. Are you working only here or... Or you do something else? Just here. Now go! Go away dude! Where are you going to have lunch? To Rosetta. That's a mistake! You should try The Cricket instead! Route 207. The Cricket? Yes! Good food! And two beautiful ladies too! And two beautiful bottoms! - I understood. Bye! - Bye! Ulisse? Ulisse? I'm your bitch. Tell me that I'm your bitch. Yes, you are my bitch. No, Wilma, not tonight! Not tonight. Calm down, come on. You don't desire me. I want it instead. You always want it! I'm more then fifty! We've done it this morning. Calm down, I'm not a rabbit! You liked to have a different woman every day, uh? - Wilma... - Whore man! Let it go! I'll take care of it. Cricket? Come here. What are you doing? I'll show you that I'm not jealous. What do you have in mind? Come here. Ulisse says he is tired, but... He doesn't sleep. You understand, don't you? Let's stay with him. You...? Me? Never! It's a joke, stupid! Go to sleep. He believed it! - Good night. - Good night. Wilma, you never make me sleep! Good morning! - Nice day, uh? - Good morning! - Good morning. - Good morning. Today it's a good day for him, isn't it? Are you disappointed? No! I understood. Is it ready, Sergio? Perfect! Good! Bravo! Cricket? Cricket, come here. What are you doing? I'm repairing the car. From Monday I'd like to go around. Twice or three times a week. I need some money. Why? It has to be a surprise, but... I can't keep secrets with you. All right... Come here. Can you see those men working there? I decided to make the large square bigger so that the trucks can park without problems. And there, - over the hedge. - Yes. I'll build a small villa. Far from the truck drivers. It will be your daughter's. And it's not over yet. I have many other plans! Ulisse! You are a God! I'm coming back on Wednesday! Bye girls! I come back on Saturday instead. I have to work. I can't wait anymore. I go to visit Wilma. What if Ulisse comes back? If you fuck her, I swear I'll change hat! Wilma, open! Open! What do you want? I want you! You came in the wrong room. This is Ulisse's wife bedroom. Mrs Wilma Meneghetti's. Open, come on! Hey! Go for a walk! I'm a married woman. I apologize, I made a mistake. It was just a crazy moment... Good night. Come. I heard you. Let Wilma alone, she is married. You love Wilma a lot, isn't it? Yes. Look! Cipria is back! I have something for you! How nice of you! You are beautiful! Thank you! And this is for you. So you can forgive me that I was away. Wow, that's big! You shouldn't anyway. I wanted to! You are beautiful! Where's Ulisse? Where did he go? He started trading again. He needs money to build more things here. Have you seen there? He founds out it is easier not to work... Instead of doing other things. I can understand him anyway. I would never have enough of you. All men got bored of me! Well, not bored, but tired! Let's go. No! I can't with you. You're too handsome, too refined. You scare me. A man like you already cheated on me and that's enough for me. How come? You'll see what he did to me. She is eighteen now. Who are you waiting? Nobody! If you seethe bus, call me! Wilma? Wilma? It's here now. Quick! Here it is! Wilma's bottom is the best above all! But you can't have her! He is right. The girl is coming! I know it! Saveria! Saveria! - My girl! - Hi! - My husband. - Hi Saveria. - I really wanted to meet you. - Nice to meet you. It seems a century since we last met! Now three! - Do you like your room? - A lot! It's nice, isn't it? Look at her! Isn't she beautiful? She's mine! I created her! - She has a degree too! - Yes! She is very beautiful! Now I'll take care of your luggage. Saveria, isn't it? Yes. My name is Saveria. It smells good. Really? Look what a nice tomato sauce! It smells good. I'd like to try something! How good, girls! - Leave it! - Let me try! OK, but don't finish it! They use their hands, but they are good boys. My beautiful daughter! What are you doing in the kitchen? Go away! Go away, come on! Go dude, go! Hey you! Go out now! Let the women work! I'm here Wilma. Are you cooking the rabbit? May I test it? Of course! Will it be enough? Is it good? Cricket, do me a favour. Let Saveria sleep with you until she got used to this life. - Understood? - Yes. Is it nice Cricket? What? To make love. It's the most beautiful thing on Earth! Do you make it often? Are you virgin? Yes, but I know how a man looks like. Sure! You're a teacher, you studied it on books! No, I didn't study it. I saw it. So? Well, it's funny at the beginning. It makes you laugh too. But after you played with it for a while, it becomes nice, strong. Turn the lights off. Let's sleep. I'm not sleepy. I like to sleep with the lights on. All right. Good night Cricket. Good night. What are you doing? The same you are doing! Professor, drink something so you've some inspiration! Sing something nice, something poetic. Go on Professor! I knew the clean version! This is much better. You're finished already? Sing something, come on! Professor, why don't you play "Ohi Vita, ohi Vita mia"! Sure! I'm sure Wilma is going to sing now. - Wilma, sing! - Oh no! Come on Wilma, please! Do it for me! - Have you ever heard your mother sing? - No. Now you will. Come here. Stay away from my heart. My thought goes to you. I don't want nothing, I don't wish nothing. Only to have you always here with me. I'm sure about this love, as I'm sure about you. Oh life, my life! Oh heart, my heart. You've been my first love, you'll be the first and the last for me. Oh life, oh my life! Oh heart, my heart! You've been my first love, the first and only for me! Bravo mom! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! So many applauses! Tomorrow you change your wardrobe! You'll wear something better! But you also... I am what I am. Wilma Malene, showgirl and bitch too. You are not! My daughter is not! Cricket, put her to sleep, she is tired. Go! She has to rest Go! Who are you anyway? Why is my mother so angry? She loves you. She wants you to become a princess. How stupid. Hey you! You're too curious! Close your eyes! Ulisse. I'm scared. What do you mean? Scared of what? Too many men around, too much sweat. If someone jumps on my girl, he won't move. Come on Wilma, don't go too far! These people are good, you know. Yeah, good people... I tell you so! Good people like you. I saw how you looked at her tonight. Oh no, darling! Wilma, my love, I... I looked at her because I was trying to imagine you as a young girl. Twenty years ago. Twenty years ago, uh? Is this flesh old? Touch it! Stop it now! Come to bed. You just need a glance. Men would queue! I have to leave early tomorrow. Good morning! Good morning. Is Wilma here? No, she's out. Better! I can talk to you then! Who are you? Who? Who are you talking to? Nobody is here! So tell me who you are. Cipria! You look great! Please, take a sit. Bring us two orange juices. Ice cold! Yes mom. Where have you been all this time? It's been a while... I've been waiting for you. I've been away. My father is making big business with his furniture shop. Our business is all around Europe. Great! Here you go. Leave them here. How do we open them? What were you thinking? Wait! - No, no! - Wait! It's easy. Bravo! Saveria, go into the kitchen. I'll take care of the bar. Yes, mom. Thank you. She's your daughter! You could tell me. Tell me. Were you as beautiful as she is when you were young? Am I old now? Cipria! Don't tell me you like this disgusting music! Lower the volume! It disturbs! Are you deaf? It's just us here! It disturbs me, all right? Turn it off! Cricket! Turn it off! I'm becoming crazy! Okay people, I have to go. I have a delivery in France I'll stop in Monte Carlo. Two tokens and I'll win on Ranieri! What do you think Saveria? Come with me. You'll sleep on my truck. Listen. Are you my mother's bodyguard? Is she afraid I'll take her lover away from her? You are crazy! Your mother would never cheat on Ulisse! Do you really think she'd tell you? Why not? What do you know about your mother? I talked to my father, you know. He used to visit me often at the boarding school. He brought me presents. Then we used to go to the funfair. - And he told you about your mother? - Yes. What do you think about what he told you? He liked her. Are you disappointed? You put my mother on a pedestal. Even if Wilma is rich, she's a loser! A failed bitch singer! What's wrong? Why are you crying? Nothing, it's the onion, don't you see it? Saveria, come here. What did you tell her? Nothing, we were joking. Your Cricket is crazy! Cricket is the only friend I have. So be careful on what you say! Forgive me Cricket. Please forgive me, I didn't mean it! Let me go! Forgive me! No, not like that! Up those legs! Put your leg up! I'm talking to you Isabella! Magic eye, give me some light. I'll come to say hello later. Hey guys! That's Wilma! Yeah! It's Wilma! Did you think it was Marilyn Monroe? - Rest! - Stay, stay. Did I disturb you? Go on pretending I'm not here. Why did you come here? Who knows... maybe to see what a theatre looks like. It's nice to see you after so many battles we did together. Too many, dear Bertazzoni, too many. What do you do now? A business... gasoline and coffee. Tonight you are invited at my place for dinner! What a nice surprise! Did you see how big it was? Look Saveria! Quick! A wish! I'd like to find out that my mother really loves me. And that she always has. I'd like to find out that love really exist Please Cricket, stay by my side Of course. Here we are! What's this? This is all mine! Coffee and gasoline! I drunk too much wine... I can barely walk! Good night, - Wilma Malena. - Good night. Let's go Saveria. - Let's go inside. - No! I want to see my mother drunk! No, no! Let's go inside. Wilma... Thinking about it, I believe you could be part of the business again. You said that the shows are dead. Yes, but I'll make you sing good songs, and so you start again the business. You are joking! No! You think about your voice, study a lot! Then it's true. What are you doing? Are you crying? The audience will be yours this fall. You'll see. Wilma! Are you waiting for someone? I was waiting for you! I've been waiting for you the whole evening. Wilma! Wilma I want you! Leave me. Leave me, you are hurting me! Leave me! I can't resist... You are the most beautiful one! Shout it then! Because nobody tells me it here! Tell it that I'm the most beautiful one! Of course! I'm going to write it on my truck, and I'm going around the world! Everybody has to read it that you're the most beautiful one! I don't care about the world. Shout it here! You are the most beautiful one! Louder! You are the most beautiful one! Yes! And I'll sing again. Wilma Malene will sing again. Yes ! Wilma Malene will sing again! Immediately. Immediately. Now Carburo. What do you want Saveria? I want you to do to me what you did to my mother. No. It's the first time for me. Go back to sleep Saveria. Go! You know, what happened tonight is something I can't explain. Maybe it's love, I don't know. I won't do something so bad to Wilma. Did you understand? Go! Go! Can you give me a ride to the bar? Get on! Hold on! What are you doing! Bye! Are you the Cricket? No, I'm the ant. Bye. Clean the bar, Penelope. Your husband could come back today. Cricket. What happened to Saveria? What do you think it happened to her? Here! You made such a mess tonight! You took her virginity yourself! Do you understand what you did to her? Carburo... No. Not him. I hurted you so much. I did the worst thing a mother could do to a daughter. No mother and no daughter! We are just two women! An old one and a young one! The young one learned! I want all the men! Did you understand? No mother, no daughter. From today, no mercy. We are two enemies. Bitch against bitch! Wilma Malene is not dead yet. Almost there! It's the good one Carburo! What's wrong Ulisse? It seems to live in a funeral here! Why? I don't really know. The three of them don't speak. You cannot beat Ulisse! Madame? What? Nothing... Cheers! When you come back Ulisse, you'll give me a return game. I won't leave again. We are back! Like that... Would you like to drink something? What do you think?

Actually I can't. - I'm busy. - How come you can't? So you told me a lie before? All right, I'm coming too. - No, no! - Don't be silly Wilma! Can't you see it's all fake? Have you seen it? We should tell them to get married. I'll see you tomorrow. I won't let you leave! You are not leaving with the storm coming! Am I right mom? Alberto can sleep here, isn't it? Ulisse decides. Of course he can! Come in Cipria! Why Saveria is not sleeping with you? Why don't you ask her? Stop it! - You won't sleep alone! - No, no! - You let mein! - No, I'm coming tomorrow okay? - Swear it! - I'm not! Go away! What's wrong? Can't you sleep? No. I'm worried about them. But why? He is a good boy! Good night. Wilma... Go to bed. It's better for everybody. What's wrong? Are you scared now? You are a beautiful woman, I like you! I like you very much. But Ulisse is my friend and I'm not going to do something wrong. Moreover, I think I'm in love. In love, uh? Yes. You understood it, isn't it? Your daughter is different from the other girls. She is a good girl. It's the first time I feel this. I wish to have a wife. Good girl, uh? A good one, isn't it? If you want to know this, three nights ago, my daughter had sex in a truck. Wilma don't say silly things! Go away! You are jealous! Your daughter is right. You talk like a failed bitch singer! Wilma... Be careful! Slowly, slowly! Now, you be careful too! Are you sure he was drunk? I'm quite sure. Otherwise he wouldn't have jumped into the river. Who knows where the flow left him. We told him to stay here for the night, but he... Mrs Wilma? How is she? She's still sad. She loved Cipria. He had to marry her daughter. I'm going now. Greetings to your wife. - Thank you. - I'll keep you posted. Good bye. What do you think Maestro? It's good, it's good. Bravo! Bring me many roses! Where are you going? I have to buy many things. We're in lacking of everything. Right. This thing is upsetting everybody. I should move from here, see new people. I'm coming with you! I understand. You take care of Ulisse. I spoke with Bertazzoni. I have only to get ready to go back on stage. I'll take you with me. Are you happy Cricket? Yes ! I understand your game. You want everything, isn't it? What did you say? Are you crazy? You are wrong! I'll be the boss here. Why? Do you want Ulisse? Do you want to kill him too? Are you telling me that l killed Cipria? Yes, I am! You took the gun and your mother pulled the trigger! You are an asshole! You are a piece of shit! You are disgusting! Remember it, Cricket. I'll be the boss here one day and then you'll be off from here! Bitch! I'm not called Cricket, for you I am Fralinetta Leoni. Who's there? It's me. Do you need something?

There's a woman who's drowning! Wilma! Wilma! The Cricket who's drowning is there! Wilma drowned! Cricket tried to help her, but she didn't manage it! Cricket! I knew that a fish like you couldn't drown! I tried, but I didn't succeed. She didn't want me to help her. Do you understand? She didn't want me to. They don't have to know I am alive. Stay here. Put it down. Put it down! Yes, we had enough of Cricket! Saveria! You are exaggerating! I can turn your head like this! Soon you'll have to call me Mrs Saveria! Can't you sleep? I can't. Are you thinking about them, uh? Yes. Those who killed her. THE QUEEN Hello Her Majesty! Hello Ulisse. Should we play? Like the old times! Like the old times. Saveria! Bring another glass! Mine! What could we bet, Ulisse? Whatever you like. I'll bet the quarry. If it was mine. I would bet even a woman. I'm sure l could take her from you. I'll bet all women with you! And against just one game. There's no problem anyway. Even Saveria? Yes. Yes, even Saveria! One moment! I decide for myself, not you! Shut up! Shut up! He cannot win! You didn't understand! It's ok if you bet me, but it's me who decide to be the bet! The one who wins, takes me. At 250 points. No return game. You! Don't make mistakes! Don't worry. Why should I cheat on you? Yes. I win. I've never liked easy games. Let's say... You'll pay me a drink. Cheers! You don't make favours to Ulisse! Carburo! That's enough! The joke lasted too much! Enough now! What joke? You thought you were betting me! But you both betted yourselves! I win and I want my prize! Saveria! Where are you going? Saveria! Saveria! Saveria! Saveria! I'll kill you both, son of a bitch! Damn you! Stop now! I'll kill you! If Ulisse is following us, he didn't recognize you. Carburo! So? Did you decide to leave? I found a job in the city. You know Cricket, I'm sorry that you are leaving. I'm sorry too. A lot. Good luck. Good bye.
