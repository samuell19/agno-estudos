Dates back to the 1760s. And American schoolteachers didn't know George Washington was sworn in then. The American teachers... Thank you so much, guys. Can she see us? Can you see us? Take off your pants and she'll see you. It will happen soon. I know it. I am going to die soon. This summer. You always say that. Hey, Lyoshka... are there any prostitutes in Anadyr? I think so. Let's invite one out here. We can find their numbers online. I dunno. She'd have to fly way out here. Yeah... Five hours here on the plane, an hour of work, and then... another five hours back. We could ship her in like a cargo. Are you nuts? She'd freeze like a dumpling, and then your dick would freeze too. Remember that girl we watched? What was that? Wait, was that your first time? You can watch chicks on a webcam sex chat. They even show you their tits sometimes. They have ones from all over. From Africa and America. Like, ebony girls, or lesbo action... So what's that girl's name? HollySweet999. You fall for her? Are you going to watch her again? Yeah, you've fallen for her. Oh, it's you. I'll die tomorrow for sure. I'm busy tomorrow. Hi. How're you doing? Can you hear me? You're... beautiful. We don't have blondes like you in my village. What city are you from? I'm Lyoshka. Well, hey there! You finally made it. Give me a bigger piece. I didn't get anything from the previous hunt. I was out in the tundra. Thank you. Hi. Thank you. Let's go to Lavry. I set up a date with a girl there, she's expecting us, like. Wants to get to know us closer. Well? Wanna come? Oh, oh! Shit. Oh, oh, oh... Lyoshka, I want you. If you were in a porno would you fuck a cow? Shit, so much for our fucking trip! What a shit bike. It's totally dead. I should get a better cross bike. Well, it's summer. We won't freeze. That chick... the one from Lavry who wants to meet up... you made her up, right? Whoa! Ten years or so ago, my uncle stole a boat, sailed across the Bering Strait, crossed the border, and made it to Alaska. From there he walked to the big city. It's called Teller. So there you go, five hours – and a new life, America! They have skyscrapers a thousand floors high. McDonald's and hot chicks as far as you can see. America, America! But you can't go any more, the border patrol stops people halfway. So how can I talk to her then? - To who? - That chick from the chat. Dunno. Speak American to her, I guess. That's where they're all from. Go on, give her a wave. Let's talk about boys and girls. I am a boy. I am a girl. I am a girl. You are a girl. You are a girl. I like you. I like you. You are beautiful. Can I kiss you? I like you. I like you. I like your dress. I like your dress. You are beautiful. You are beautiful. A grapefruit. A car. A dog. A dog. A dog. A dog. A car. A dog. A grapefruit. A dog. A dog. Who is that? It's... Kolya. Kolya Tanko. From Provideniya. He was headed over there, to Alaska. He got there in 40 minutes, crossed the border. Then the Yankees found him. He had a harpoon on him. And they thought... it was a firearm. They stopped him, started shouting, "Drop your weapon!" But he didn't know their language. They shot him down. Probably wanted to see America. He tried. - Galina! Galina! - Out of the way, Chukchi! Who is she? Some chick my uncle brought in from the mainland. Everything's fine! Don't worry, things will work out great for you. You'll have four daughters and three sons. You'll go to Moscow. You'll see the Kremlin, Red Square, Spasskaya Tower, with the clock, and the President. Hang on, let's check this hand out. You will have a lot of reindeer. Well aren't you shy. Hmm? Give me a hand? Don't worry, it's easy. Don't stand around, come on over. Come on. Come on. Don't worry. I don't bite. See? Nothing scary about it. Hey, come on. Go ahead. No need to be such a baby. Go for it! Touch me. See how warm I am? Please... I'm so sorry! Nothing happened between us, anyway. DETROIT CITY Hey. - What are you up to? - Just watching. - Watching who? - HollySweet999.

Look, kid: that there is Alaska, and that... is Chukotka. America. Russia. The past. The future. Take a step: the past, the future. Monday. Tuesday. I killed my friend. Over some woman? Sir...

Uh, there's a kid here, 16, 18 tops. Fresh wounds on his face. Might be one of the poachers from Uelen. Could be armed, I don't know. Over. I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay? My name is Leslie, Leslie Brooks, with the United States Border Patrol. Do you understand? What's your name? You have a name? Are you from Chukotka? Chukotka? Yes? Great. Okay. Look, kid, I need to know what you're doing here. Understand? What are you doing here? Are you trying to cross over? To America? Hmm? America, Detroit. What? America, Detroit. Did you say "Detroit"? Detroit, Michigan? All right, I've... I've been there once. It's a shit hole. What the hell do you want to go to Detroit for? Look, it's... it's impossible. You can't... They won't sell you a ticket. You know, a ticket for the airplane? You know, the airplane? The giant metal bird in the sky? Look, you can reach Alaska. That's possible. And then what? You think you can just walk straight to Detroit? You can just trek through the snow for a couple of hours and you'll find... skyscrapers and McDonald's? I mean, that's not how it works. Do you understand me? Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You didn't understand anything. Hey! Hey! Hey, kid. Don't. Don't. Slowly. What are you doing... What do you have there? Okay. You're trying to show me the map. That's fine. That's fine. I'll explain to you. All right, open the map. Open the map. Slowly. Slowly. It's okay. Show... Kid, don't. Don't. Put it down. Down. Put it down! I'm gonna count to three, and you're gonna lower your weapon. All right? You got three seconds. One. Two. America! Detroit! I'll tell you what, we'll put our weapons down... Hmm? I will take you. All right? I'll help you. Deal? You put your weapon down, and I take you to America. Do you drink coffee? Coffee? Just tell me, why, why Detroit? Huh? Why not California? I have a girlfriend there. What? I have a girlfriend there. I'm sorry, I don't... speak Russian. I thought maybe it's, you know, you have a girlfriend? Something like that. You know "girlfriend"? Love? That's it, right? That's a long distance relationship. All right, we're almost there. Alaska. Oh, by the way, I got something for you. Marshmallows. Do you know this? I used to eat that when I was, uh, in the Boy Scouts. You, you run a stick through it... Hmm? A twig... And then you roast them over the fire. Huh? Fire. Good luck, kid! And welcome to the USA! Detroit? Straight ahead! Can't miss it! America... America... America... America... I've had enough. I am tired of this America already. Hey bro! - What's up? - I'm alright! - What's with your head? - You bashed it the fuck in. - Oh, I forgot! - Shit, you're stupid. Don't fucking hit it, it hurts! Ages since I saw the village. I thought I killed you. Mom said I got 5 stitches. My brain almost leaked out. Take me to the tundra. I'm going to die today. I'm hungry. I won't die today. Take me home.
