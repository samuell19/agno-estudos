[Man over radio] Coming up next, we've got the last song recorded with Ben Gould. Yes, it's global heresy's new single, throw me a line.

Hello. Thank you. Your ladyship. Morning, Charles. Good morning. Thank you, Benson. Are you packed, Margaret? Yes, sir. And you, Benson. Packed, are we? Yes, sir. Taxi is going to be here within the hour. Undoubtedly, sir. Benson, do you hate me with every fiber of your body? Most definitely, sir. [Laughing] You see. Deaf as a bloody doorknob. Not every fiber, your ladyship. (Charles) You'll have the time of your lives. It's a fine boarding house I'm told, Benson. The finest in Middleton-on-sea. Forgive my asking, sir, but what does one actually do on holiday? Nothing, Benson. That's the whole of the point. Nothing whatsoever. And where will your lordship and her ladyship be staying? With friends. Friends, sir? Here is your spending money for the week. Don't go wild. We will endeavor not to, sir. (Charles) Bye-bye, Margaret. (Diana) Good-bye, Benson. Bye, Benson. Bye, Margaret. Benson has grown unnaturally insolent of late. Perhaps he suspects something. I did catch him eavesdropping when that woman from the rental agency was here. He doesn't know. He mustn't know. No one must ever know. [Screaming] (Flit) Oh, yeah. Christ. [Screaming] This is awesome. [Screaming] (Man) Global heresy is sweeping the world, but this is a tour which nearly didn't happen. Nothing has been heard of the band's founder, Ben Gould, who's been missing now for over two months. At today's press conference, the world will be introduced for the first time to his successor, Natalie Bevin. [Rock music] ♪ (Man) ♪ she slips down, wishes that she did it again, ♪ ♪ again, again. ♪ (woman) So why'd Ben do it? Just up and leave? Yeah, did you see it coming? Was he, you know, suffering from depression? (Man) Here's what he did say. There is no f-ing way this band could continue without one of us. We found someone who's more than up to the task of getting the job done as our bassist. Ladies and gentlemen, Nat. (Man) The, uh, press release makes for interesting reading. Session musician, played with some of the best, first time in a band. But just who is Nat Bevin? [Together mockingly] Just who is Nat Bevin? How does it feel to be a woman in rock? How does it feel to be a man in journalism? I work hard at what I do; I have to. She's good. Headlights a bit on the small side, but we can always get that fixed. Haven't the staff arrived? No, and I paid. They'll get a rollicking from me when they do turn up. Well, you better come and help me unload, Charles. What am I? A Porter? Vintage champagne? Why push the boat out when you can sink the bloody thing, eh? (Man) There's this rumor going around that not even your record company has heard your new stuff. (Leo) Yeah, actually, you know what it comes down to? We don't want any interference from our record company while we create, all right? You know what I'm saying? Okay, this is not good. Dickheads, what are you? All: Dickheads, sir. Never let the artists have control over their own music. They'll end up playing what they want. Creative control was a condition of their signing, sir. That is why we hit them with the 90-page contract. Right? What the large print giveth, the small print taketh away. Well, then let's renegotiate their deal. Who the hell are you? James chancellor, sir. Hospitality. Jim's going to be looking after the band while they're on retreat. They're vulnerable right now, what with not having a manager. All right, my son. Run it up the flagpole, come on. Right. The way I see it is this: We hand them a chunk of the merchandising, the t-shirts maybe, posters, and while they're rubbing their hands together, we cross collaterize their asses through the back door with a clause buried so deep we don't even know it's there. Oh, yeah, all right. Yeah, yeah, come here. I love it; I love it. But will they go for it? I'd stake my job on it. You just have, my son. You just have. (Woman) For the next week you're in hiding at some secret location somewhere in England? Are we in hiding? I guess we're gonna be in hiding. (Man) Some people are saying this disappearing act is little more than a cheap publicity stunt. Bullshit. It's costing me a bleeding fortune. [Screaming] [Lively music] ♪ (Leo) So, Jim, where you taking us? Back in time to a house that's old. Like Keith Richards old? Older than that. Older than, uh... Think of the pilgrim fathers and then add a bit. (Jim) It's owned by a lord and lady Foxley. Miserable bastards by all accounts. Great, tea on the lawn with the Huffington gruffingtons. (Jim) Oh, don't worry. They're clearing out for the week. About bloody time at that staffwise recruitment. What do you mean was? Who is this? The receiver. Ceased trading, debts. That's impossible. They banked a £2,000 check of mine last week. Don't "apply in writing" me, you bothersome little man. I have paid for a cook and a Butler, and I want them now, do you hear? Nat. Hmmm? Man in your life? Woman with your package I'm sure has a man in her life. Or a woman. Everyone's a lesbian. (Diana) Now, Charles, don't start. It's off. That's it. It's off. Oh, fine. That's splendid. And all you'll need do is add another £6,000 to the 2,000 we've already lost. £6,000? Well, you're the lawyer, Charles. You read the contract. That's the penalty for defaulting on our side of the rental agreement. Well, we have just over an hour to find replacements. Well, perhaps I'll, uh... I'll ring Mrs. Moat of west Flaxington and her husband. Never. No one in the village must know of our position. Charles, we are about to become £8,000 poorer unless we find two people. Two people. No. [Laughing] Oh, no. If you suppose that a man in my position would stoop to becoming a servant in his own home, then you are gravely mistaken. You've forgotten gloves. He always wears gloves. Does he? Never noticed that, Diana. No, not Diana. Margaret, Benson. [Lively music] ♪ Charles, they're here. Think of the house, Charles. Life as we know it. (Dave) Check this out. Good heavens. Here it is. They've brought their children. No one said anything about children. Hi, I'm James chancellor, and this is global heresy. (Charles) I beg your pardon. Yeah, well, I guess you're not exactly their target audience, are you? That's okay. Alfred! Nice bat cave, my brother. Man, this is huge. Way to go, Jeeves. Show me my lair. Check this out. Dave, Dave... check it out. Carl, Carl. Hi, I'm Nat. You're Nat. Hello. How's it going? Hello. Hi. I assume their parents will be joining them later. Not that I’m aware of, mate. Hat box? [Laughing] Uh, yeah. (Jim) Waiter, could you have a look in the Van and pick up any of the remaining bags? Thank you. Did he call me a waiter? Yeah, this is just the hallway. Check out the acoustics, boys. Nice, very, very nice. Look. [Laughs] Oh, god; Oh, yeah. At least I did something right. [Screaming] En garde, my friend. Young man, an explanation is in order. We were told that Foxley hall had been rented by a multinational corporation. Ici or mbm or something like that. Mgi. Exactly. Not this bunch of punks. Music group international. That bunch of punks happens to be the hottest band to come out of the states in the last five years. Oh, they're musicians, are they? The best. The reason they're here is to get some peace and some quiet and some time on their own, and that means no one must know that they're here. So I couldn't exactly announce their arrival. Well, I suggest you announce their departure. I'm not standing for this, old girl. [Laughing] Well, now I'm worried. The Butler's revolting. I'll have you know, young... (Diana) Benson. Oh, I get it. You're thinking the tabloids would just love to know where they're holed up. All right, how much is that worth? 100? If you think for one minute... (Diana) Benson. 200? (Diana) Three. £300. Each. Bonnie. Clyde. Look after them; They're nice kids. Have at you, sir! Surrender your arms, sir! Hey, do you have room service, Jeeves? Oh, ho, ho, ho. Accident, accident, accident. Oh, ho, ho, ho. Oh, ha, ha, ha. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Hey, flit, flit, flit. Look at this poster. Whoa. No way, that's fucking pathetic, dude. You can't do that. I called this shit. Come on. Fuckin' a. Dude, this place would be awesome if it wasn't so old. Those are my digs right there. There's groupies over there; Check it out. Where? (Dave) Hey, flit. Boo-ya. I think it's a sealy. Your mama's got no teeth, and that's perfect for her line of work. What's up, my good man? Could you point me to the hydroponics room? Oi, Igor, give us a hand with the sound check. I beg your pardon? All right, when I give you the signal, all right? I beg your pardon? Hey, just give it some wrist, you know. A bit of townshend. Bit of townshend... I think he means you to touch the strings. All right. Really? Touch the strings? [Guitar sounds] Could be worse, noise-wise, I mean. And again, mate. [Loud feedback] [Crashing] [Laughing] [Loud feedback] Now, don't get settled. They've requested drinks and a tour of the house. Then I suppose you should oblige. Willingly. You'll find the ingredients for dinner in the fridge. [Laughing] And here we have the portrait gallery. The first Earl of Foxley. It was he who built the house. Hey, fellas, how'd you like to rest your balls in that chimney? [Laughter] Hey, like father, like son. Check this cat out, man. The size of the honker on him, man. Oh, hey, that is a noble piece of ass. Anne Salloway. Wife of the second Earl. Oh, I'm feeling that. The second Earl must've been hung like a horse. Are you kidding me? That was an arranged marriage. They just wanted to build in some good-looking blood. Guess there's no keeping that ugly gene down. Looks aren't everything. What is that, Benson, the family motto? Wow, those are some fun bags. [Laughter] Oh, dear. I just remembered... I forgot to show you... Something. Something in the study. Hey, Benson, that is a bad batch of baby batter right there, my friend. U. G. L-e-y. [Beeping] All: ♪ you ain't got no alibi ♪ you're ugly [mutters] Wretched children. ♪ You're ugly I've just been showing our guests the portraits of lord Foxley's 17th and 18th century forebears.

(Dave) Margaret, this place sounds awesome. Gentlemen, I say we have an easy week ahead of us. (Dave) Nat, that rocked. I listened to the tapes. Were you guys able to hear the kick in that middle section? 'Cause you were all over the place. (Carl) In that first gig, there were three people. (Leo) Four teeth among them. That was crazy. I remember you... Beef stew. Heavy beef stew. That was 7.1 on the Richter, Margaret. Bon appetit. (Carl) Thank you, Margaret. (Charles) Certainly. Mmm, mmm, mmm, bring it on. [Laughing] Do not go in there. (Leo) Did you let one go or is that our food? You know what? I think tonight I'm going vegetarian. This vegetable... It is a vegetable. It is not many vegetables. It is one cohesive unit. Barbarians. Bloody barbarians. Oh, was it that bad? (Charles) Worse. Oh, well. First thing tomorrow, I'll hire replacements to be insulted and ridiculed by these uncouth, overhormonal, dipsomaniac wastrels. Good night. What about the washing up? I believe the washing up is Margaret's involvement. Benson is going to bed. Charles. What? (Diana) You... you know... (Charles) What? Sleep well. Hey there, big fella. Hello. Hello, Benson. Oh, yes. I thought I’d... Well, you thought wrong. I did? Oh, well, I can assure you that you'll be very comfortable. Oh, you're gentle, are you? Gentle, yes. No. Out. There's a hairy boy in my bed. Well, of course there is. And where are we supposed to sleep? In the servant's wing, of course. Here, take this. He has plastic trousers; Did you know that? [Tires squealing] [Lively music] ♪ Morning. Good morning. Ah, this is so beautiful in here. It must take so much work. Oh, yes. Benson spends half his life out here. Don't you, Benson? Yes, I do, I do, I do. I spend most of my life with my flowers. [Laughing] What are those ones called? Those; Those would be white ball flowers. Oh, really? Yes. What about those? Those, they would be, um, pink bell flowers. Pink bell. Yes. Let me guess. Are those, um, purple trumpet flowers? I thought you knew nothing about flowers. I'm a quick learner. [Giggling] See ya later. I thought Benson had resigned. Having slept on the matter, I feel it is our duty to introduce these savages to the ways of civilized society. They'll be the richer for it. Yes, and so will we. Financial considerations had nothing to do with my decision. Potatoes. For breakfast? Hash browns. It's a special request. Hash browns? [Dog barking] [Laughing] Benson tried to shag me last night. (Leo) Get outta here. (Carl) I'm serious. (Flit) Thanks, Benson. Nat, pass me the milk. Hey, Benson. Sleep well last night? I could have been more comfortable. (Carl) I'm sure you could've. Hash browns at last. (Dave) A horse; A horse. My kingdom for a horse. Pray, be seated, good knight. Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks. Park your metal ass. Thank you. Hey, Dave, you want a little sugar with your joint? Benson, have a seat. Join us. It's not the done thing for servants to consort with the guests. Oh, no, no, absolutely. Come on, we've got coffee. We've got tea. No, thank you. Come on, come on. Benson, have a seat. No, thank you.

It's just the bass line. Well, we don't want to rewrite the bass line. We're just here to teach it to you. She's got a point, flit. Relax, if she wants to try something, let her. (Leo) We'll try it, okay? Okay. (Leo) We'll try it. If we don't like it, we won't stick with it. [Quirky music] [Straining] Jesus, Benson, if that thing comes off, you will never get it back on.

[Coughing] You, um, do you need a hand, Margaret? Are you trying to tell me something, David? No, no. Well, actually, you, uh... you're definitely the only person I know who can burn a pot of water. Exactly what are those? Well, those were potatoes. Okay, um... Here, why don't you sit right over here? Here, yeah, grab a seat. Here you go. And why don't we start over? I think that's a good idea. Okay, here. [Evil laughter] (Jim) It's all there in black-and-white. Posters, t-shirts, badges even. You know, it's a lot of merchandising. What about action figures? (Nat) What's the catch? There isn't a catch. It's just Tony Manson's way of saying thank you. I mean, let's face it; You've been very good to us. Yeah, well, we need some time to think it over. Yes, of course you do. Yes, of course. Of course, of course. That's why we've got until, um, the weekend to sign. The weekend? I just think you're liable to offend him if you leave it much longer. Why drag your feet? Come on; It's a lot of money. Well, if he likes us that much now he'll like us that much on Monday. Quiet. [Sighing] (Carl) Sit down, Jim. Sit down. Jim, sit down. Sit down, Jim. Dinner is served. (Leo) Oh, nice. (Flit) Where'd that come from? Did you actually make that? With a little help from my sous chef. Believe me; It was all Margaret. The age of chivalry is not dead. I might be getting some tonight. Romeo and Juliet. I was just looking at that quotation of David's. "Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks." Extremely fresh of him, I thought. It was tactful of him to omit the last line. "And death's pale flag is not advanced there." Jolly well is, Charles. I'm old. Rubbish. One's as old as one feels. Yes, I fear you are right.

Well, you gotta understand, Margaret, that flit and Ben... They were... They were real tight, you know? They were... They were like brothers. Well, what exactly happened to Ben? (Dave) Well, we were playing a gig in Washington, and Ben took a cab out to a place called Chesapeake bay or Smith point or something, and, uh, well, all they found were his clothes on the beach. Good heavens. And, Margaret, you know what? I'm, uh... No disrespect, but I’m a little stoned right now, so could we just lighten it up? What does he want? (Leo) Don't worry about it, Nat. If it was anybody else, flit would be bagging on them too, so just let it go. It's ridiculous. (Carl) You're fine, Nat. You're good. Yeah, yeah, you were great. You let the rhythm sort of, you know, ride, drift. It was good. Kind of tread water. That's big fucking music talk from a hospitality guy. Oh, I've done my time in management. (Carl) Really?
