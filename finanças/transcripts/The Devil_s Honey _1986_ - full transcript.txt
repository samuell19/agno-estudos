Wait. Let me. Take ten, people. I need a coffee. Sure, go ahead, I need to rehearse. Don't worry, I'll bring you guys a coffee. Forget about them, they can get it themselves. Nicola is such a jerk. You should tell him to go fuck himself. No, stop, they'll be back in a minute... We'll be quicker. No... I don't want to... Stop, I said... I'm still your master, never forget that. I've had enough of your fetishes. You know I like you, Cecilia? You're the only girl in my life. You drive me crazy. No! You only want a piece of me. Nothing else. What are you going to do? Just dedicate this one to you. Are you ready or not? Ready when you are, Nicola. I'll be as soon dear Cecilia walks out of this room. You can't focus if she's here. Bullshit, my friend, and you know it. You're acting even bitchier than usual today. Whatever. Let's call it a day, we'll start again tomorrow. Wait. Hold it. I think you should wait for me down at the bar, Cecilia. I promise I won't be long. All right, big boss, you can have him for another minute. We've got all the time in the world. Bye-bye. Recording. Dr. Simpson is needed at the casualty department. Dr. Simpson is needed at the casualty department. - That was a very complicated surgery. - I agree. - Doctor... - Thanks. Keep an eye on the patient in intensive care. I'll check on him later. Of course, Professor. - Are his relatives here? - Yes, yes. - How is my son? - There's still some pressure on his dura mater, but I think you'll be able to pay him a short visit tomorrow. Medicine isn't an exact science, I'm afraid. - I don't know how to thank you. - You don't have to. - This is yours, Professor. - Thanks. By the way... - Is that you, Anna? - Yes, Professor. Tell my wife I have an urgent surgery and I won't be able to pick her up. Yes, Professor, right away. Goodbye. Thank you. It's open. Excuse me, Madam, your husband called to say he won't be able to pick you up, because he has an urgent surgery to perform. I see. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck with another client, a real troglodite. He had so much energy I couldn't get him to stop. I'm telling you because I know you like that I go with other guys. Isn't that right? Christ, I broke it! Pardon my French. You'd never imagine the money I spend on tights. It's like a curse. Every time I go to a client I always seem to be wearing the wrong tights. I'm not making up excuses, believe me. There... Fixed it. Just a second and I'll be with you. Don't stop! It turns you on, huh? You like watching me? Good boy... Or maybe you like the colour red? What does it remind you of? Here, look... I like touching myself... Stop. You're an obedient slave... Aren't you? Go away now. Damn you. With you it's worse than being with that troglodite. Get out of here, you whore. - You're a sick freak. - Out, I said. What else do you want, a bouquet of flowers? Asshole! Come on, don't be like that. I couldn't play with you there, and now the studio isn't available anymore. Yeah, right, I'm such a big disturbance. So I guess you consider Nicola to be a good inspiration. "Let's call it a day, we'll start again tomorrow." He just can't stand me. Don't talk nonsense, he's just a little nutty, and the problems with my job... How about my problems? Come on, Cecilia, let's bury the hatchet. Don't make that face. I will, until you say you're sorry. These are just lying kisses! No, they're the kisses of someone who likes you. I love you! I love you too. Give me a kiss, then. Another. Anything wrong? I can't sleep, that's all. I was asleep. Go to sleep in the other room, you know I have an operation in the morning. You were asleep, right. Just as usual. What did you say? Nothing. I wanna go faster. - Hang on, Cecilia. - What are you doing? You're crazy! - Come on, please. - No! No! - No, look out! - Don't be scared. - Relax, don't worry. - All right, I'll do it! Go on, Cecilia. I'm only doing it to appease you! Yeah, keep going... - You're losing control! - Don't stop. - Watch out! - Don't stop. Keep your hands on the handlebars! Keep going... Faster... - Do it. - Gaetano, please! - Faster! - I'm scared! I want to get off! - Don't stop! - We're gonna crash! - Keep doing it! - Do it... - Gaetano, please! Slower... - Do it slower... - No! - Yeah, like this... - Be careful! Yeah... You're such a nut, nut, nut. I love you. Keep still, don't move. You're gorgeous... You're incredible! Don't you get how beautiful this is? Don't cry... I want every part of you... Everything! Come on... I can't... I can't do it! Come on, it's so good... You have to do everything I want. You have to do everything I tell you to do. Don't be ashamed... Yes, like this... Like this... Stop, you're hurting me! You like being mine... Enjoy it. Enjoy it, slut. I can feel you're enjoying it, I can feel it... Yes, like this... I love you. I love you... Cecilia! Cecilia... Why don't you look at me? What else do you want from me? A kiss. Just one kiss. You want to cuddle after acting like a perv? I want you, Cecilia. Come on, I know you liked it. You treat me like a piece of meat for your desires. I love you, Cecilia. That's what really counts. - Let's go. - I'm not coming with you! Cecilia, I said let's go! Didn't you hear me? I'm not coming! I bet you'll change your mind. Of course you'll change it, you can't live without me! I'm not coming! - I know how to make you change your mind! - Liar! I'm not coming! - I wanna be with you forever! - No! I love you, I swear! - Stop lying to me! - I'm not lying! - Yes you are! - I can't live without you, Cecilia! - No! No! - I love you so much! - You'll never make me believe you! - I'll do whatever it takes! - You're lying! - I'm not and you know it! No! I don't believe you! Gaetano! Gaetano! Gaetano! Together forever. You're such a fool. Give me a kiss. Just one kiss. You really scared me. Let's go home. You sure you're all right? I'm fine. Just a little neck pain. Are you ready, Carole? We're gonna be late for the concert. Jesus Christ... What? Don't you like my look? No, I really don't. You look like a prostitute. So? I thought they were your ideal women. You're very funny, but we should get going or they won't even let us in. Right. Okay, give me ten minutes. I'll wait for you in the other room. Gaetano is here to work. It's the first time he's got the chance to record something so good. Being two hours late is not professional at all. You're right, but I'm pregnant. Oh, so I guess you'll need some money for the abortion. Listen, honey, we're breaking our backs here, get it? We aren't interested about your epic sexual activities. Stop it, he missed a note. Take it from the top, Gaetano. I'm sorry, Nicola... Do you mind if we stop for a few minutes? My head is spinning. No way, we gotta finish recording tonight. I know. Start the track. - You ready? - Ready. Why did you stop? Gaetano! Doctor Dominici speaking. Yes. I see. I'll be right there. - Is it so urgent? - A motorcycle accident. Take a cab and tell the others I'm sorry. Call the hospital and tell them you're not available. Don't talk nonsense, Carole. I'm asking you for the last time, Guido. Call them and have another doctor perform the surgery, I can't spend another night alone! I need to talk to you! I have a dying patient, don't you get it? It's my job! I don't care about your patient! I don't care at all! What's the matter with you, Carole? Sure, keep pretending you don't know. I'm dying. I'm dying a little day after day and you don't even realise it! Is this really the time for that? I have to perform a surgery on a dying man. But you never have time for your wife, not even at night! There's a cab stand, take one and go to hell! I'm not one of your whores! You turned me into a miserable wretch! A wretch begging you for a little love! I've had enough, I can't take this anymore! I want a divorce. God, please, don't let him die... Don't let him die... Please... God, don't let him die... Don't let him die... Please, god... Don't let him die... I want a divorce. I want a divorce. Scalpel. - Hurry! - Sorry, Doctor. I'm not one of your whores! I'm dying. I'm dying a little day after day and you don't even realise it! - Aren't you feeling well, Professor? - No, I'm feeling fine, thanks. He's gone into coma. He's requiring mechanical ventilation. Yes, I see. You drove me crazy! - Condition of the heart? - Irregular blood flow. I can't spend another night alone! I need to talk to you! I have a dying patient, don't you get it? I don't care about your patient! I don't care at all! What's the matter with you, Carole? - Calm down, Cecilia! - He's dead! I know he's dead! - Calm down! They'll save him! - He's dead! I know it! Please, Cecilia, you've got to be strong! Be strong, pull yourself together... Professor! Professor! Wait! Come back here! - Cecilia! Stop acting insane! - You son of a bitch! Come back! - Come back, you son of a bitch! - Cecilia, stop! - Come back! - What are you trying to do? - Calm down! - Come back... - It's no use. - Please, try to pull yourself together. He killed him. Leave me alone. He must tell me why he killed him. Murderer... Murderer... God... Please, don't let me lose my baby. How do I look? Terrible! Try to keep still! Hey, it's not my fault the camera operator sucks! We're making a film, not a snapshot! - Well, try to keep still anyway. - Should I? Changed my mind, take my picture! - Like my pose? - Yes, perfect! Wanna do one in profile? - Sure. - A three-quarter profile? Here's my Humphrey Bogart look. - And here's my Marlon Brando look. - Keep still! - How was it? - Looks good. Hey, Cecilia, blow me a kiss. I'm sick of posing. I love you. I love you more than I ever thought possible. I love you. Leave the camera on. Come here and let's make love. Don't keep me waiting. I... I don't photograph well. Don't be crazy, you're gorgeous. - You're a gorgeous, stunning lady. - No! Gaetano, wait! - Let me switch off the camera! - What? I want to leave it on, that's the point! - No! I don't want to! - You're so beautiful when you're mad! - We'll watch it together. - No, stop! I hate doing these things! Switch it off! - Everyone should see you naked. Everyone! - Stop! I don't want to! No! Congratulations. - Good shot, that was a tricky one. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Hi! Hello. - Let's try the eight hole. - Sure thing. Carole, wait a minute. Please, let me talk to you. Oh, things have changed. Now I'm the one who doesn't have time for you. - Be serious. - I'd say you missed me, if I didn't know you so well. But it's true, I missed you. - I wouldn't mind a drink, join me. - Sure. - Your drinks. - Thank you. - I'm going to Paris tomorrow. - When are you coming back? I'm not planning on coming back. You can't just leave me like this. Of course I can. Please. Don't do it, Carole. I... I love you. I really mean it. I need you. - You're my whole life. - Oh, am I? Since when? In all these years of marriage I never realised you needed me or anybody else. No, that's not true. - Sorry, I have to go. - Wait! Please. Why don't you stay for another night? To do what? We could dine out. Just like old times. To... To give me the chance to show you how much I still love you. - Do you really mean it? - Give me a chance, Carole, and I'll prove it to you. All right. - Pick me up tonight at nine. - I'll be there on time. Good afternoon. A pretty girl gave me this for you, Professor. That's very kind of you. "Why did you let him die?" Professor Dominici? No, he's not in. No, I don't know what to tell you. Hold the line a moment, please. This girl has been calling all day, Professor. - I'll be in my office. Put the call through. - Yes, Professor. - This is Professor... - Why did you let him die? Why? Hello, can I speak to Professor Dominici? He plays that piano with such emotion. Maybe he's in love too. - I don't have time for jokes. - But you're gorgeous when you smile. Try it, please. Did your wedding ring become too tight? Or did you take it off for a more serious reason? What's the point of keeping the ring? You don't really consider me a wife. All right, I admit I've spent too much time with my patients, lately. It's not about the patients, it's been too long since the last time you desired me. You're right. But if you could show a little goodwill... No, Guido. Maybe talking could solve the problem. It's no use, we already talked too much about it. I want you to take me to bed. To bed, the only place where I feel alone. Does my moaning turn you on? I bet all your hotel whores do it. Treat me like you treat your whores, Guido. I'm sick of your respect. Oh, yes... No... No, don't answer it... Don't answer it. I'm sorry, Carole. I didn't want it to end this way. I'm really sorry. If only the phone hadn't rung... You're a bastard! And a coward. I've had enough. It's over. Please, Carole... I can do it. Please, don't go. Carole, please... - Hello? - Why did you let him die? Why? Start the car, quick. And drive slowly. Take the next turn to the left. Come here, boy, take it easy now. Take it easy, come to your master. Come on, boy. Sit. This prank has gone too far. Please... Take this noose off my neck. I'm not an animal. Please, I'm begging you. I've had enough. Untie me or I swear I'll... Stop! Stop it! Here, good. That's a good boy. Good boy. I'm glad I've managed to see you. "I'm sorry, the professor is attending a congress”, "I'm sorry, the doctor is performing a surgery", "Why don't you try calling again later?" Well, it looks like I've finally managed to see the famed professor, now that he's not busy killing patients. You don't know what you're talking about. Why are you crying? Aren't you happy to see me again? You left without even calling me once. You know I always come back to you. I can't live without you. Here, I got you a nice present. I got it from an antique store. Now you can't say I never think of you. I bought it because it looks a bit like you, you know. You've got the same eyes. Give me a smile. You want to kill me, don't you? Tell me why you let him die. I didn't! - I didn't! - Why did you let him die? I did all I could, what else was I supposed to do? What else? Why did you let him die, you big shot surgeon? Nobody could have saved him! No, take the dog away! Take him away, take him away! No! Please, stop! I see the great professor has peed in his pants. Did you see, Black? The eminent professor is only a man, like all the others. He made a mistake. He can make mistakes. We're going to make him pay for his mistakes. No... Don't turn your head, dear. I want you to look... ...as I kill you. Just do it quickly. You'd really like to die? You're a liar. If you really want to die, Professor, you'll have to kill yourself. Go on, leap forward and hang yourself. Don't mind me. I'm not squeamish, and neither is Black. I'm sure you'll be able to make it painless. We wouldn't like you to suffer. Yeah, I know I'm old enough to be a father, but that doesn't mean I want to have a child yet. But I do. Think about it, Cecilia. We don't need a child. Can you imagine how you'd look like with a big belly? I don't care about my belly, I want a baby. I've dreamed about it all my life, I want something to love! Something mine! But you have me. No, you don't belong to me. You could leave me any moment. But you're the only man I love. That's why I want this baby, to have something to remind me of you forever. This must be why I love you so much, Cecilia. Come on, let's make love. That's all you ever think of. Well, can you think of another way to make a baby? Out! Get out! You can't understand this pain! It once meant life to humans, but not anymore! Out! Does it hurt so bad? Shut up, asshole. If you think I'll die from this pain, well, think again. Women always survive these matters. Even useless ones like myself. Oh, Christ... It's worse than I imagined. What are you looking at? My cramps won't go away for hours. The last time they were so painful was when I lost my baby. I can't even dream of having another. It's all over. But my body will keep painfully reminding me every month. A message reminding me of death! Death... You destroyed everything in just one night. I lost my baby, and you killed Gaetano. You turned me into a miserable woman who'll never have children! There's only death here. I'll never have any children. I'll never have any children! I'll never have any children. I'll never be a mother! Never! Never! Never! Go on. You like the taste of your own blood? Lick it, you bastard! Enough! Keep walking, big shot. I know how to kill your desire. Now I know how I'll get rid of you. What's the matter with you? It's too early, get up. I'm not ready to do it yet. Death has given you to me as a gift, you know. You've become a slave of your own victim. Come on, big shot! Move! You wanted to die, didn't you? Go on, then, show me how good you are! Gaetano wasn't afraid to die. You killed me and him both, and now ['ll do the same to you! Down! Drink it, you scum! Drink for not having even answered the phone! Drink! Drink for all the lives you ruined! I'm ready to kill you now! Drink! Drink! Keep drinking! Don't be a fool! Get up! It's up to me to decide when you'll die! Don't quit on me! It's up to me! I hate you. I'm still going to kill you. Why did you leave me alone, Gaetano? I can't stand being alone. Look at me. No, wait a second. Keep still. I can't do this anymore, I'm tired! Don't you like being an artist? Artist? Having a gun stuck between my legs is just gross! It's just gross. - You weren't like this before. - What do you mean? You know what I mean. Forget about what you just said. Put the gun back where it was, I want to record you. You're such a beautiful girl. I mean it. It doesn't make any difference. I still think you're beautiful. Flattering me won't save your life. I like you a lot. Here. If my dog eats it, you can too. He doesn't mind sharing. He'd like you to have a little. Eat it. That's all you're gonna get, Professor. What's your name? You called me many times, but you never told me your name. I wonder if the eminent professor would be able to operate on my doll. Without killing her, of course. If you're successful, Professor, I might let you live. Maybe. "Your world will end once she appears, as what you believe in will disappear. You will hardly breath when you lay your eyes on her, but she will laugh at your desire to possess her. She will drive you mad before stomping on you. She will destroy your soul through the purity of fire. Yet, you will be happier than you have ever been. Because she is the Devil's honey, and you will taste it." That was written by a friend of mine, many years ago, when we were young. We laughed at him. My name is Cecilia. My name is Cecilia. You're a real bastard. You're always mad at the world. This is how I want you. Faithful and obedient. Poor Black. Someone Killed you. Just like someone killed Gaetano. I love you, I love you, I love you. Can't you say anything else? I've had enough. Let's see what you'll say now. Here's what happens to your daughter! At least I've got you again. Thank you... Thank you... Thank you. I want you to be clean when I'll kill you. And I'll do it today. You better start praying, Professor. I want another. I feel so happy. I wish Sandra was always happy like that. Let's go, I think we should leave them alone. But shouldn't we tell them? - Or they'll think that we... - Well, it was Nicola who asked me to. - Come on, let's go! - Hey, don't run! Excuse me, I want to buy a gift. - A gift for your girlfriend, huh? - Yes. - Are you in love? - Deeply. Leave it to me, I have just the thing for you. This looks like a normal bracelet, but it's not. Really? What's so special about it? Put out your hand, Miss. It's a magic bracelet, and it's also unique. It doesn't look like much but, my dear lovers, it has incredible, uncanny powers. It's the talisman of love! If one of you will stop loving the other, you'll have to throw it away! Otherwise you'll be in big trouble, that's what the Oriental wisemen say, according to the thousand years old alchemical arts! It's only 4,700 lire for each bracelet. - Here, keep the change. - Thanks. - Have fun! - Let's go. Well, guys, did you have fun? We did, thanks for asking. What would you like to do now? Where's Sandra? Back to the hotel, she was tired. So, got any ideas? - Well, we were also thinking of going back to the hotel. - Now? Don't be silly. I don't feel tired either. Let's go to the movies. There's a theatre nearby playing an American film. It's an old one, so we'll be spared any psychological subtexts. Sounds great. Come on, let's go! - Slow down, you two! - You better hurry up if you want to catch us! The Navy gave me this medal when I returned from the front. A medal for all the years I spent fighting in the Pacific. - You're full of bitterness, George. - It's not bitterness, Jennifer. I'm full of anger. A blind rage I can't get rid of. I've seen too many atrocities and too many cold-blooded murders, I don't feel I can trust others anymore. Even your father kept staring at me tonight. I know that he sees war when he looks at me, just like everybody else. He sees all those many senseless deaths. Of course I know that they've welcomed us with a parade, with all those schoolchildren waving their little flags, but I just had to go to a bar around the corner to find people staring at me. There was this guy, you could tell he was one of those who profited from the war, he told me to remove my uniform because the war is over. I'll keep fighting, but this time it'll be my own war! My own private war, do you understand? I'll never leave you, George! It's the talisman of love! If one of you will stop loving the other, you'll have to throw it away! Go away. My love... Your friend's poem... What did it say? Tell me again. "Your world will end once she appears. You will hardly breath when you lay your eyes on her, but she will laugh at your desire to possess her. She will drive you mad before stomping on your soul. Yet, you will be happier than you have ever been. Because she is the Devil's honey, and she will destroy you by the purity of fire."
