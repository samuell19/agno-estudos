But I'll be back before you know it. If you're going, Laura, I'm going with you. And miss all that champagne? Don't be silly.MAN 1: Hey, Laura, don't go. MAN 2: What do you expect us to do while you're gone? Cecily, help him find something to do. WOMAN: Why are you going to the airport, darling? I need some fresh air. I'll see you soon. ALL: Bye. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE] Thank you, William. Thank you, Mrs. Pember. [HONKING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [HONKING] [WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA] Is Flight 712 on time? It should be touching down any moment, madam. [WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA] Do you have any fronotal tablets? No, I'm sorry, not without a prescription. Piriton?No. Aspirin or...Aspirin. That won't do me any good. Thank you. [PLANE ENGINE ROARING] LAURA: Ellie, here I am. See you at customs. Oh, it's so wonderful to have you here. It better be. I left a fabulous job to come. The first one I ever had, too. I'll make it up to you. Besides, what's so fabulous about drawing pictures for Neiman Marcus? So that's why you've asked me to come. To save me from advertising. Sure. Aren't you glad to be here? I'm glad to be with you. And you certainly dressed up for me. Oh, there's a big party waiting for you at home. And now we're going to get you through customs fast. One thing about you hasn't changed. You still drive too fast. You mean something has changed? You're thinner. Well, I'm not going to cry about that. Wouldn't it be nice to be turning into the ranch right now? We could be. Hey, Laurie, why don't you ever come home? I wouldn't fit in there anymore. Maybe I won't fit in here. Don't you try to. Who'll be at the party tonight? People. Will Mike Bannerman be there? I'm not expecting him. You know, Laurie, when you said, "Drop everything and come," I thought it was for a wedding. Mike and me? Ah, no. Don't you think two mistakes are enough? Any more questions? Yes, just one. Why did you ask me to come? Well, because I think sisters should see each other every couple of years. Sure, but you sounded... How did I sound? As if you needed me. Well, I do need you. There wouldn't be any point in this party tonight without you, would there? [BAND PLAYING JAZZ] Laura darling, welcome home. We suspended action whilst you were away. Except at the bar, I see. Aren't you introducing me to your little sister? Ellie, this is Freddie Cadogan. Stay away from him. Is he dangerous? Not really. Laura's just being generous. Hi, Laura, where's Mike? Well, how should I know? No, not now, Charlie. Later. Look, my sister has to change. Oh, when Mike's away, can't the mice play? You are not a mouse, Charlie. You're a rat. Come on, honey. Look, she's been on a plane for 10 hours. We'll be back in a little while. MAN: Cecily, Cecily, come here, darling. This is your room, honey. I hope you like it. I'll leave you alone for a few minutes. You'll wanna change. I'll be back. When you're not racing, you don't race. Do you, Mike? If I'm in a race, I'll do it on a track with drivers who know what they're doing. Not out here where every kid thinks he's Stirling Moss. This Mrs. Pember's American, isn't she?Mmm-hmm. What's she doing living in Ascot? Well, her husband... Which husband? There were several, weren't there? No, not several. Only two. The first when she was a kid. He married her for daddy's oil money. And then... And then she found herself an English country gentleman. A country gentleman without a country house, so she bought him one. And decided she preferredthe house to the husband, huh? You've heard of Brian Pember. Do you blame her? No, I can't say I do. Look, Mike, how am I gonna carry out this ridiculous examination in the middle of a party? Relax, Johnny boy, you'll manage. She's a grown woman. If she doesn't want to see a doctor, why can't you just leave it at that? Look, John, I'm just a simple racing driver, not a doctor. I don't enjoy watching a friend suffer. Relax, John, you'll like Laura. I doubt that. Why? You don't even know her. I know about her. American, two husbands, two divorces, too much money. What does all that add up to? British prejudice. Well, there it is, Club Pember. If you like it, I'll get you a membership card. Well, I don't plan to be in regular attendance. Hey, what do I do with this? Well, take it in with you. They'll think you're one of the musicians. Or the plumber. Oh, you'd really be in the money then. Mike Bannerman. Hey, Mike's here. Hi, Linda. How are you?Hi, Mike. Come on, dance with me. No, later, Linda. I...Oh, come on. Just one, quick, short. Linda, I've got... Mike.Hi, Tony. I'll be back in a minute, John. I'll find Laura. Hey, Mike...Linda, where's Laura? [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE LAUGHING] Scotch, please. Very good, sir. On second thought, make it a double. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Hi. Mike. Mike darling. How are you, Laura? Fine. I'm getting better every minute, but I didn't expect you to come. Now, these didn't used to be here. Well, you left and they came. Or vice versa. Anyway, you're back. Oh, Mike, I've missed you. I'm not back that way, Laura. Well, what way are you back? I don't know... Well, shall I be a sister to you? Don't be cynical. Well, what's wrong with being a sister? We might as well be married. Well, at least that's one pitfall we escaped. Oh, I nearly forgot, I have a friend downstairs panting to meet you. Sending in a second team, huh? I'm just carrying the message. You don't have to meet him if you don't feel like it. I don't have to meet him, period. But I do feel like it. That's my girl. That's your ex-girl, you mean. [CHUCKLES] All right, Mike, now you clear out of here. I've got a lot of repair work to do. Hello. Hey, you're someone I know, aren't you? No, but I know you. You're Mike Bannerman.Mmm-hmm. I'm Laurie's sister. Ellen, of course. How are you? Fine.This is your party. Mike, what's wrong? What do you mean? Well, Laurie, something's happened. What's wrong with her? Well, what makes you think something's wrong? I know my sister. What is it, Mike? Laura isn't well and she won't see a doctor. I make an appointment, she breaks it. But why?I don't know. But I'm glad you're here, Ellen. And I hope you'll think I've done the right thing. Come on, I'll tell you about it. Hi, Mike. Hi, Freddie. What do you mean, Laura,walking out on your own party? You promised me the first dance when you got back. Did I? Well, I must remember never to make promises that involve so much breakage. Well, there you are. Are you having a good time and is Mike seeing that you meet everybody? Certainly not. I'm keeping Ellen to myself. But I will introduce you to my friend. He's over at the bar waiting for me to keep my promise. Which one is he? Uh, tall, dark and handsome, lifting his glass. So that's the second team, huh? I'm not sure that John would put it that way. Well, now that I've seen him, I'm not so sure that I would either. ELLEN: He does look nice. Come on. I'll take you over.Relax, pal, I think I can make it without a sponsor. Mrs. Pember, may I have the pleasure? Colonel, I thought you'd forgotten all about me. Oh, my dear, never. [LAUGHING] Come on, Colonel. Get with it. Get with it. Get with it! [PEOPLE APPLAUDING] Hello, John. You're quite a dancer, Mrs. Pember. Well, I had quite a partner. After all that exercise, I'm sure you'd like a drink. Well, it would help. A large bourbon for Mrs. Pember, please. BARTENDER: Very good, sir. How did you know I liked bourbon? I could tell by looking at you. Thank you. Well, here's to getting to know each other better. You know, you don't look like a hostess. What is that supposed to mean? Hello, Laura darling.Hello, Mavis. Well, it means you look like a woman. Not like someone with nothing but refreshments on her mind. I hate that being a hostess bit. I'd like to just cut through all that rot. Evening, Laura.Hello. Well, for better or worse, I rather think you have. You don't look like most of Mike's friends. What does that mean? Well, racers look like racers, you know, somebody with a label. I've always thought it must be a terrible fate to look like your job instead of yourself. You still look like a man. Well, thank you. Very nice words. And truthful. Would you like to dance, Mrs. Pember? Well, I'd better warn you. I'm not up to the Colonel's acrobatics twice in one night. If you dance with me, I'm afraid you'll have to forget the Colonel. [SLOW JAZZ PLAYING] Look, uh, I know you have to stick around, but do you really have to stick around in the middle of it all? Do you have some better place in mind? Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. Come with me. Nice library. Make much use of it? As a matter of fact, I don't. I don't use any of this house, really. I've never been able to feel at home in it. Why do you stay here, then? Oh, it's all right for parties and guests. Besides, I have another place.Where's that? Oh, I have a cottage in the Cotswold. It's not big enough to be a real house. But that's my real home. Nobody's ever seen it except the people who helped me clean it up. I suppose that explains why I can put up with all this. That light hurt your eyes? Yes, it does. Ugly modern lighting. I much prefer the old oil lamps that they used to have on the farms outside Polruan when I was a boy. Polruan? Where's that? It's in Cornwall. Where do you live now? In London.Alone? Is that an impertinent question? [CHUCKLING] No. No, on the contrary, it's very pertinent. It shows that you have an old-fashioned sense of ethics. You're the first person who's used those words to me in a long time. Well, yes, as matter of fact, I do live alone. My wife died five years ago. I shouldn't have asked. Why not? Why is everyone so damned afraid of being personal? After all, what else is there in life apart from our personal relationships with other people? You know, I'd like to ask you all kinds of questions. You mean, did I hate my father? Did I ever... No, no, no. Closer home than that. More about now. You know, what do you think about, what do you feel, suffer? Suffer? You do, don't you? I thought I hid it pretty well. You do. Those burns on your fingers must have been quite painful, but I'm sure you didn't complain. Oh, I don't get any credit for that. I never even felt them. Well, you'd better not tryto get so much mileage outof your cigarettes after this. You're very observant. I'm very interested in you. Look, would you do something for me. Shut your eyes for a minute. I generally keep them wide open. Oh, come on now, who do you think you're kidding? You close your eyes to everything you don't want to see. You live in a house that you don't find comfortable, you give parties like this that you don't like, and you won't face it. Well, I faced it with you. Yes, but then you don't always have someone like me around to make you face the truth. Thank God. What are you, anyway? A mind reader? No, my line is science. Head shrinker. Good Lord, no. But I have got a test for you. Now, uh, shut your eyes and hold out your hand. You know, we used to play a game like this when I was a girl in Texas, only we didn't call it science. What did you call it there? What we said was, "Open your hand and close your eyes and I will give you a big surprise." All right, then. Open your hand and close your eyes and... What would the surprise be in Texas? Well, it could be a kiss or it could be a lizard. Okay, then. What's this? I really don't know. I do know it's not a kiss. It could be a lizard. May I open my eyes now? No, no, you keep them shut. Well, that's very good. You passed that 100%. It wasn't a kiss and it could have been a lizard. Now, come on, shut your eyes again. Let's have the other hand. Look, John, if you want to hold my hands, we don't have to play games. Oh, good, I'm glad you said that. But this is a game. Shut your eyes now. Now, then, which arm? The left. And now? You can't fool me. You never even touched me. You have very nice hands, you know. Capable of doing something,not just limp female flippers. You'd make a fine judge for a Miss Universe contest. You forgot your drink. Hmm? Oh, yes. And what about yours? You shouldn't encourage me. I drink too much. You drink very little. It increases your vertigo. I'm not accustomed to being contradicted. You're not accustomed to hearing the truth either. I don't need any help. I smoke too much. And you tell yourself that's why your hands shake, that's why you have constant headaches. All right, so I have headaches. Who doesn't? That's the way you tell the humans from the animals. Well, it's a pretty poor way. Humans also, I take it, can't stand their own lighting systems. They've lost their sense of balance. Can't judge distances, take falls. You're a doctor. You creep in here disguised as a guest and pretend to be interested in me, and all the time you're nothing but a damned prying doctor. Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself. Now, go find somebody else to practice on. Mrs. Pember, face it. Your memory is shot to pieces.Your vision is unreliable. Sometimes you see only half of what's there, other times you see double. Half the time you're crazy with headaches, and the other half you're so doped up with painkillers, you don't know what's going on. I'm not your patient.Quite right. My patients choose me. But you'd better become someone's patient very soon, or those headaches will become uncontrollable. The lack of feeling on the right side, which is now only partial, will become complete. Your eyesight, which is already damaged... Let me out of here. Your eyesight, which is already badly damaged, will be permanently impaired. Your sense of direction, which is... What do you think of my sense of direction now, Doctor? I think it's downhill and willfully bound towards self-destruction. Look, you need help. I'd like to give it to you. I have some instruments here. Now, this isn't as bad as it looks. Just look straight ahead, would you, please? Just look at the pillar. Once again, please. Look in the same place. How long have you had these headaches? It seems forever. Maybe six months. And the double vision, the blurring, when did that begin? Just recently, a month. Good. That's encouraging. What's wrong with me, Doctor? Is it my eyes? My nerves? Now look, all I've been able to find out here is that you must put yourself in the hands of a good brain man at once. There need to be tests, observations, x-rays. Is it my brain? Well, I'd only be guessing if I said so. But it could be. Yes, it could be. It might mean an operation? Well, that's certainly a possibility. [DOOR OPENING] I'm sorry about the drink. I asked for it. How did you know I'd be back? You're not the kind of person to run away from things. I did run away. You came back. When do I have this examination? Tomorrow. What time? [KNOCK ON DOOR] Laurie, you idiot. How do you like my hair? Well, it looks fine. Why? Well, it looks exactly like your own hair. It looks too much like me. I'm tired of the old Laura. She suited me. You're just prejudiced, honey. Oh, my, this really is the new frontier, isn't it? Here, be a redhead. Me? No. Well, if you don't like that one, here, be a brunette, and I'll go blonde. You can't tell the front from the back. Whoa. You know, I think I can get you a job guarding Buckingham Palace in that look. Yeah, but you look like Harpo Marx. [BOTH LAUGHING] Ladies. The hairdresser is at the corner of the next street. That's better. And you, Mrs. Pember, what is that you are wearing? Oh, this is a nightgown. A nightgown? Well, tonight we won't be needing such a gown. We're going to take a nice little pill and go sleepy-bye in this, so as to be ready for our operation in the morning. Into bed with you now. Sister, I am willing to get back into bed, I'm willing to be awakened at dawn to have my temperature taken, I'm willing to have my head shaved, to give samples of blood, not to mention a few other samples, and to have ten thousand shots in my tail. But I am not willing to wear this stupid Mother Hubbard, when there is no known medical, surgical, hygienic or psychosomatic reason for wearing it. And you can go tell your matron, your head surgeon, and the Minister of Health that I said so. Oh, I told them long ago. And what did they say? No. But since they're not here just now, why don't you just hop into bed with your ball gown on and take that pill? [KNOCK ON DOOR] LAURA: Mike, I thought youwere having to sit upall night with a sick Ferrari. Ah, it took a turn for the better. ELLEN: Hi, Mike.Hi, Ellen. Well, what's going on here? A civilized operation. At least I'm trying to keep it that way. Mrs. Pember?Yes, Nurse. Come on, Laura, I'm going now. See you tomorrow. And you, too, Mr. Bannerman. I just got here. A late starter always loses. Isn't that right? I didn't know you were running this outfit according to Grand Prix rules, Sister. [CHUCKLES] Good luck, Laura. So long, Mike. Bye. It's so beautiful. Cumberland Street? It looks pretty good to me at the moment. It's funny, isn't it? It's beautiful all the time, but until you think you might lose it, you just take it for granted. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh, what's the patient doing out of bed? She's being a very good girl, Doctor. Into bed with you now. Is Sister giving you a hard time? Oh, no, she's sweet. Sometimes she thinks she's in the army, though. Do this, do that, on the double. Well, she likes discipline. The only thing... To have her cut off my hair. Now, Laura, you know you have to have your hair cut off. Oh, I know and I shouldn't mind, really. Same thing happened to my grandmother. What? You don't mean that... Different surgeons, Apaches. She was scalped. Oh! Halfway between Raton and Wagon Mound. Bad place to be scalped. [CHUCKLES] Doctor, I'm gonna give you a test. Shut your eyes, please. Hold out your hand. I'm going to place an object in your hand. Identify it, please. I'm not sure. I think I need a bit more time. Sorry, Doctor, you failed the test. We shall remove your head promptly at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. It's a painless procedure, guaranteed to alleviate all your troubles. Will you be there tomorrow morning? Yes, I'll be there. Promise me something? What? When they've got my head open, see if you can put some sense in there, will you? [WHISTLING] You surgeons. Prima donnas? How the hell can you be so cheerful? Who said anything about being cheerful? I have every right to be. That was a good piece of work I did this morning. Yes, well, I must admit I was thinking about the patient. Think of her. She's been given eight, ten months, a year, maybe, of normal living. Don't you think a year of life free from pain is worth something? God only gives you 70 and no guarantee of that. What you gave her with the other hand was a death warrant. I didn't give her that. She was born with that. It's our passport for travel out of this world. Anyway, what's this Laura Pember ever done with her life? Rich American playgirl. Mike Bannerman's girlfriend. I didn't know you read the gossip columns. Don't have to read anything. Bannerman's a national hero. Papers are full of his pictures. Most of them with Mrs. Pember. Look, John. Last week, I operated on a young mother with four children. She's got six weeks, maybe. The most brilliant student up at Christ Church, fracture in a car smash. Couldn't do a thing. He's going to be a vegetable the rest of his life. I didn't whistle after those operations. But Mike Bannerman's girlfriend. Oh, stop calling her Mike Bannerman's girlfriend. Oh, ho? And don't "oh, ho" me either. All right, so she isn't the mother of four children and she's not the most brilliant student at Christ Church. All the same, I don't look forward to telling her. Don't do it, then. What? Are you suggesting we try and keep her fooled about her condition? Why not? I don't understand doctors who want to play God with their patients. What are you talking about? The facts about a patient's condition are their property. I've got no right to withhold them. That would be playing God. I'm sorry I ever brought God into this. Let's get back to someone I know better. Me. When you diagnose a glioma in me, don't tell me. I don't want to know. You know, one day in my office she said, "The trouble with me is, there's never been an Alamo in my life." What the hell's an Alamo? Oh, it was a battle, a life and death struggle in which every Texan died a hero. Well, she's got her Alamo now. Do you think I should try and hide it from her? It's up to you, John. I don't ask you where my knife should go, can't tell you how to use yours. But you agree that in the long run a clean cut is often the best? In my business, certainly. In yours, maybe. When you going to tell her? How do I know? It's not a question for an IBM computer. I'll tell her when I think she's ready to hear. In the meantime, I'd be obliged if you'd give your usual glowing report on the success of the operation. Her sister and Mike Bannerman are waiting downstairs. Mike Bannerman? I've not met him. Don't tell me you want his autograph?Why not? You know, I've alwayshad a sneaking idea thatif I hadn't turned to surgery, I might have been a first class racing driver. Maybe so. After all, good hands, strong nerves and death are never very far away. There is a likeness. There's a difference, too. Very few surgeons perish in the operating room. How is Laura? A lot more relaxed than you are at the moment. Well, the operation, was it successful? Absolutely fine. Laura will be all right? You're going to get a sister back you haven't known for a long while. And those headaches? Gone, finished. [SIGHING] Oh, I'm so happy. You're Mike Bannerman? I'm Eric McKenzie.Mmm-hmm. How do you do? I've never seen you drive, but I follow you in the papers. What do you think England's chances are at Monza this year? Well, I'm going to be there. Which means?I'm optimistic. [ERIC LAUGHING] Take it easy, Mike. I met some of your friends upstairs in surgery. Oh, I only want to meet surgeons socially. When can we see Laura? Not today, of course. Tomorrow, perhaps. Dr. Carmody here is in charge of visitors. Well, goodbye.Goodbye. See you later, John.Goodbye. He's a wonderful man, isn't he? He's the best brain surgeon in England without a doubt. I'm so happy. Let's celebrate. Great idea. Champagne all round. John, you deserve a share of this, you know? You can drink my bottle, Mike. Two, if you like.Please come with us. No, you two run along, have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow. See you, John. Goodbye, Doctor, and thank you. Goodbye. Oh, that pill. When I woke up and heard the sounds, I thought I'd just fallen asleep for few minutes. But it's over, isn't it? Yes, it's all over. Dr. Carmody, will you do something for me? That depends on what it is. Oh, it's easy. Put something in my hand, the way you did before. It's a key. I can see again. And I can feel. Ah, the good doctor. Did you call him? Of course not. Do I act sick? Well, Doctor, we're flattered. We didn't know you took an interest in anybody without a disease. Oh, look at him scowl. That hit home, didn't it, John? You keep drinking beer, Mike, and my interest in you will be professional. It's a planned program, Johnny boy. When the cars turn over, those skin and bone boys will shatter. I'll roll. Hello, Ellen.Hello, Doctor. Laura was very disappointed when you couldn't come to her party. Oh, nobody wants a doctor at a party like that. Why not? Well, he's a reminder.Of what? Except for him there wouldn't be any party. Where's Laura? Oh, she's way off there somewhere, having her first ride since the operation. Oh, Doctor, you should see her, she's... Ellen, Mike. I'm glad I found you two alone together. There's something I've got to tell you. What's that? Ever since the operation, I've been putting this off. The day Laura left hospital I wanted to tell you, and... Is there something about Laura we don't know? Yes. You mean she's not cured? No, not permanently. In six months, 10 months... It's coming back? Yes. Well, I don't believe it. I won't believe it. I have to tell you the truth, Ellen. She has at most maybe a year. Oh, dear.Oh, no. No. JOHN: These growths, in everyone, they always come back. Well, can't you take it out again? No. Not a second time. You let us believe. I thought you needed more timeto get over the shock ofthe operation itself, that you'd be stronger, calmer. How can you expect me to be calm knowing that Laurie's going to die, that she has to go through allthat horrible suffering again? There won't be any more suffering. She'll be as well as she is now. Just towards the end there'll be a dimming of vision. You mean blind? Yes, blind, but only for a short time. Perhaps not more than an hour. John, you're not thinking of telling her? That's why I came down here today, to tell you and her. Well, how's the fact that shehas only got a few more monthsto live going to help her? Don't ask me how. Look, you're no stranger to death. In fact, you haven't been able to find life supportable without putting the possibility of sudden death into it half a dozen times a year. Okay, but I don't want anyone telling me, "Bannerman, you're gonna get yours on the tenth lap." Nobody has to tell you, you know. Ellen, I'm sorry I had to tell you. Perhaps you'd rather not have known? No, no. I'd never have forgiven you. There are so many things that I can do now that I know that time is so short. Do you think it might be that way for Laurie? Yes. I think it might. If somebody told me that I'd be dead in six months, I think I'd just go into a room, lock the door and never come out. No, you wouldn't. You'd want to fill every hour of the time you had left with all the things you love most. There would be no time for death until the time came. And then, because death is the last action of a living person, you'd want to do that well. With thanks for having ever lived at all. I don't think I'd have that much courage. You'll have more courage than we know. Now, come on. JOHN: Laura. Dr. Carmody. I thought you were never coming. Well, I thought you needed a couple of weeks. Oh, I don't mean that. I mean now. I thought you'd never get through talking to Mike and Ellie. Oh, did you know I was here? Yes, I knew you were here. But I had something I wanted to say to you alone. Mike and Ellie know it, of course, but I didn't want to say it in front of them. Dr. Carmody, I want to thank you for giving me back a life worth living. McKenzie's the man to thank for that. Oh, no. No, any good surgeon could have done what he did once somebody got me to him. That's what you did, and that's why I thank you. Here's a whole world I'd lost, almost forgotten. You know, when I was a girl back in Texas, we were all terribly poor before Papa struck oil. I used to go barefooted, and I'd smell the sage and the bluebonnets and the yellow violets. I loved the feel of the sun. This isn't Texas, of course, but you've given that world all back to me. And that's why... All right, I'm embarrassing you. I'll stop now. Laura, look there's something...One thing more. I want to give this back. It's one you use, isn't it? Yes, I do, or I did. This was the turning point. I'll never forget the feel of it. Listen, Laura will be here in a minute. I didn't tell her. What happened to all your good arguments? Thank God, Doctor. This is so much better. I hope you're right. MIKE: Laura, we've been waiting for you. Waiting for me to what? To have a drink with us. Waiting? You've already started. Laura, Laura, why don't you take this chair? Oh, John, look at these two. You know, there's nothing like a short illness to make your family really appreciate you. Yeah, you can include me in on that, too. What would you like to drink? Well, what are you having? JOHN: Scotch. How about you? Bourbon? LAURA: I think I'll try a Scotch. Okay. I don't believe it. You mean all this enchanted cottage business? No, not that. Just being here. Well, we've been busy. Yes, we have been to every theater in London, picnics, pub crawls. But this one particular cottage, there's always been a good reason for not coming here. But I told you all about it when we first met. And then you lapsed into silence. All right, now I'm unlapsing. Come on. Well, is it everything I said it was? Yes, it is. How did you find it? By searching, hoping. And an ad in the Times,huh? You've done a lot here. Yes, but I haven't spoiled it, have I? No. Hey, can you cook on that? Why, sure. Someday I'll cook you a pot of chili con carne. I've put some of my things in here and some of my mother's. This is where you really live, isn't it? Oh, yes. This, I've kept for myself. Laura. I want you to marry me. When? Tomorrow? Next Friday? Now, don't play games. You know very well that nothing short of marriage is going to satisfy either of us. Speak for yourself, John. I am. How do you feel? Do you really think that this is a matter for occasional dates at a playhouse? That's been my history recently. Well, I'm not planning to marry your history. I can't make any promises about my future. Nobody can. Marriage is like life, it's day by day. And that's the way I want to marry you. Day by day. What about the nights, Doctor? I can't make jokes about this. Look, John, it's so serious that if I stop joking about it, I'm going to cry. I love you. Does that make you cry? Yes, it does. Yes. Hello, Miss Kendall.Good afternoon, Mrs. Pember. Still one more to go, I see. One more? No, that's Eddie, my boyfriend. Oh. [BUZZER RINGING] JOHN: Miss Kendall, would you bring in Mrs. Erman's file, please? Yes, Doctor. Excuse me. There we are. Erman. Mrs. Ellery Prentiss. Believe me, there's every disease in the book in there, and some the book never heard of. Thanks. It's a good thing I'm not a doctor. I'd forget and leave the patient open. You and Eddie off some place? To Brighton. When Mrs. Erman gets through telling Dr. Carmody her troubles. It's a shame you have to wait. It is, but that's my job. Why don't you and Eddie just run along? No, I shouldn't. Why not? There won't be any more patients today. There is going to be a lot of traffic. You go on. I'll tell Dr. Carmody I fired you. Well, tell him to hire me again Monday, will you? Have a nice time. Thank you. I hope you have a nice weekend, too, Mrs. Pember. Thank you. I don't think you'll have any more trouble, Mrs. Erman. If you do, just give me a ring. Thank you, Doctor. JOHN: Goodbye.Goodbye. [SIGHS] Dear Mrs. Erman, she has a new set of symptoms every week. You been waiting long? Oh, no, just a few minutes. I sent Miss Kendall off. Well, come on, let's leave this place behind us. Come on. What's the matter, darling? You haven't changed your mind about going, have you? No. No, Let's get out of here. Look, I've an idea. Let's stop at a market and buysome food for a picnic supper. Would you like that? All right. You know, wine, cheese, fruit. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] A large bunch, please. Chrysanthemums. How much? How much is that? VENDOR: Five shillings, please, sir. Here you are.Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. There, you look like a bride. Why do we have to wait till the fifteenth? It's only two weeks. Well, you may never get me back from Cornwall. Now then, what about some fruit? What shall we have? Apples, grapes? Do I have to decide? No, I'll make the decisions. Pound of apples and some grapes, please. Worcester, sir?Yeah. Right, sir. Laura, your flowers. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me? I should have told you. I wanted to. I believe in telling patients. Patients? What have I got to do with patients? I'm a person, not a patient. "I believe in telling patients." That's what a doctor says, not a human being. Didn't you know me? Didn't you know I wanted what was between us to be real? It was real. It is real. It was false. You deceived me with another woman who was going to have children, who was gonna live, a woman with a future. Laura, I couldn't bear for you... You couldn't bear. That's the truth. You couldn't. So you had to build up this woman who doesn't exist. Why couldn't you trust me? Because you didn't know me. Laura. Laura.Don't touch me. Laura.Don't touch me. [CARS HONKING] [CHATTERING] [GREETING IN ITALIAN] Hello, Mrs. Pember, happy to see you. Thank you. Is Mr. Bannerman registered? Yes, madam, room 611. I think we can take very good care of you. Excuse me one moment. Mrs. Pember. Hello, Dalporto. I thought you were not coming this year. So you pulled out of the race in disappointment, hmm? Oh, no, no. I was continuing but my heart was not in it. Look, I am having a few friends later to celebrate my victory tomorrow. Why not join us? Uh, if you cannot find Mike. I'll see you at the track tomorrow, Dalporto. Thank you. They're working on it now. I just wanna make sure I've got enough revs for a really fast start. I want to be at that first bend first. Oh, relax, Mike... Oh, hello, Mrs. Pember. Gentlemen. Well, boys, I think this finishes racing for the day. MAN 1: Get a good night's sleep.MIKE: Yes, thanks. See you, gentlemen.MAN 2: Good night. 7:00, and don't worry about your engine. MIKE: Okay, see you then. Good night. Laura, what are you doing here? Mike. Mike. Where's John? Whatever made me think I could be a doctor's wife? John, I thought. Oh, Mike. You know how it is. Every woman falls in love with her doctor a little bit. And you've never done anything halfway, have you? When did halfway ever get anybody anything? Besides, I woke up in time. So you just took off, huh? What do you mean, took off? I go where I please. And you asked me down here, didn't you? Not after you and John planned to marry. But doesn't the invitation hold good any longer? The person I invited didn't come. What do you mean by that? Well, John, he's... He's... But I've told you... That's not what you're talking about, is it? So, you know, too. Yes, I know.All right. Don't you understand what I'm doing, then? I'm going to grab as much of this world as I can lay my hands on. Why not? What else makes sense? All right, tell me, Mike. I've heard nothing but lies recently. Level with me. All right, I'll level with you. So you're not going to live forever. Who is? Now you listen to me, Laura. When you and I had our good times together, and they were good, it wasn't... It wasn't part of any program to grab while the grabbing was good. I'm not a man you can use like a pep-up pill, and whether you know it or not, you're not the kind of woman who could go for a man like that. The answer, then, in a couple of thousand words is no. That's right. No. I'll see you around. Hello, operator. [SPEAKS ITALIAN] Good. I'd like to make a personal call to London, England. Dr. John Carmody. There you are. Mrs. Pember, please come in. I thought I was not going to see you again. You made me feel very sad. It doesn't show. Oh, you know us Italians. We sing when the heart is breaking. Please join us. Only if you promise not to sing. [CAR ENGINES REVVING] [MAN CHATTERING IN ITALIAN OVER PA] Make sure they give me my lap time. I'm sorry about last night, Laura. You told me the truth. That's what I've been saying I wanted to hear. Good luck, Mike. Thanks. Now, stay here in the pits. Don't move. Hello, there. Oh, fine, absolutely fine. Let's keep this contest absolutely clear, and I want that board spot on all the time. Look, I don't want to give him a time until he's done three laps. Let him settle down. [ENGINES REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Mrs. Pember? Laura Pember? Bannerman said I'd find her here. I thought she was here. She must have just left. All right, thank you. [CAR CRASHING] [SIREN BLARING] Was Bannerman hurt? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SIREN BLARING] Is someone hurt? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Is anybody hurt? Oh, just one. A spectator. Not like sometimes, 10 or 20 killed. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Don't do that, he's alive. Don't cover his face while he's still alive. But if he's still alive, it's not for long. Well, he's alive, he's alive. Let him see as long as he can. You'll have to let them take him away now, Laura. You said I wasn't the kindwho would run way from things,but I do. I said you always came back to face things, too. I don't think I'm strong enough. Yes, you are. You are. Well, from what he's bought, it looks like your husband expects Cornish pasty, Mrs. Carmody. Now, don't you go scaring her. We've only been married three days. Ah, then you're just setting up housekeeping. Well, what you got here will last quite a spell, and if you run out, just let me know.Thank you. Well, we're only going to be here for a couple of weeks. I just wanted to show my wife the place I grew up in. Well, we're glad to have you back, sir, if it's only for a visit. And good luck with the pasties, Mrs. Carmody. Thank you. I'll need it. Dr. Carmody. Mrs. Lambert. I'd like you to meet my wife. How do you do? For a minute, I took you for your father. Considering he was 78 the last year he lived here, I don't know if that's a compliment or not. It is a compliment, John Carmody. I doubt you'll ever be as good a man as your father was, for looks or doctoring. Well, I'm afraid I can't help my looks, Mrs. Lambert. You didn't tell me the Carmodys were so big in Polruan. Ah, yes, my girl, you're gonnahave to play second fiddlewhile we're down here. Thank you. You're welcome, ma'am. You know, I'll bet they'd have had a brass band out for you if they had known you were coming. And a bouquet for the bride. Well, why didn't you tell them? All you've given me are bags of potatoes and onions. Got to get you started in the right way. You can get in through the gate in the wall or up that way. You go on ahead. Don't wait for me. [SEAGULLS CAWING] Laura, is something wrong? Yes, something is wrong. You didn't tell me it was so beautiful. Oh, I told you it was up on a bluff with the bay on one side and the open sea the other. Up on a bluff. So is Joplin, Missouri. You're so used to it, you don't see it. It's unbelievable. It's so big, so open, so free, so going on forever. We call it the Atlantic. Come on. Did you ever sail a boat down there? Yes, many a time. What's the flagpole for? My dad was a ship's doctor, once. And he never got over it. He discovered he was really a sailor at heart. You know, he used to run this place like a ship of the line. More flags than an admiral. And he was right, too. Practicing down here with these people wasn't some silly Harley Street affair with a list full of hypochondriacs. The real thing. Good life, too. Come on. You know, I'm almost afraid to open that door. The house was never much, and it's been looked after by a caretaker. Oh, this is the dispensary. My father's surgery. Greenhouse out there. When I think of what you made of that cottage of yours... That cottage of mine was just a substitute for living. This is a place where people really lived. Hello. You're the boy who opened the car door the day we arrived. Yes, Mrs. Carmody. You know my name, but I don't know yours. It's Peter, ma'am. Peter Pengilly. Won't you come in, Peter? It's the doctor I want to see, ma'am. Well, here's the doctor. Well, what's your trouble, Peter? It's my mother, sir. She's drunk. You mean she isn't feeling very well? She's feeling fine, sir. She's hollering. Is this the first time? It's the first time she's hollered. And how long has this been going on? Since she got home. Last night? This morning. Well, what do you usually do for her? Hide the bottle. Well, it's a bit late to do that now, isn't it? Dr. Ashby's your doctor. Where is he? With Mrs. Saunders. She's having a baby. Well, then I expect he's pretty busy. Well, I suppose l ought to go around and see her. Yes. All right, Peter, let's go and see what we can do about your mother. Laura, what are you doing? I'm taking possession. Come on, pull. There, that's better. I thought maybe you were running up a distress signal. No. That pole looked so forlorn just standing there doing nothing. Now we're a ship of the line again. I'm not the world's best painter. You're Leonardo da Vinci as far as I'm concerned. It's what you want, isn't it? It is what you want, isn't it? It's not question of what I want anymore. I'm not alone now. It's what we want. And is this what we want? I want what you want. Well, I have thought about it, but I'm no Dr. Schweitzer, you know. Heroic doctor gives up city practice to come... No, but happy doctor gives up city practice for a time. Well, are you sure you know what you're letting yourself in for? I mean, you've never lived like this. It can be pretty bleak up here. And sometimes in the winter when the winds blows, the whole house shakes. Well, a Harley Street doctor only sees his patients in office hours. But down here, they're all like Peter. If they have a problem, they come up and see you. You'd be all mixed up with my patients, and... Good. That's what I hoped. That's what I want. Well, that's different, then. [SEAGULLS CAWING] Come in. Mrs. Hewitt, John has kept you so long, I thought you might like a cup of tea. Come and join us, Laura, we're having a little celebration. I'd better get another cup. Oh, well, this'll do for me. John, what was in that last? I think it's better not to ask. What are we celebrating? The doctor tells me I have a good chance of carrying my baby full time. I've miscarried twice and I'm not so young anymore. Oh, today's a good day. Well, I mustn't run on so. If the people who have children... It isn't so... Do you and Dr. Carmody have any? No, I... Shame on you, Mrs. Hewitt, we've only been married seven months. Oh, have you, then? Well, there's plenty of time. Doctor, after all the waiting,if it's a boy, I think I'll call him John Carmody Hewitt. Oh, maybe you were saving the name? No. I'd be very proud, Mrs. Hewitt. We both would, wouldn't we, Laura? Yes, indeed we would. Oh, do you take cream? Hello, Peter. Hello, ma'am. Would you like to see my collection? Yes, I'd love to, Peter. Are you awake? I think so. Your eyes are closed. I'm awake with my eyes closed. Can you hear? Yes. I'm awake with my ears open. Well, then, listen to the birds. It's spring. [BIRDS CHIRPING] The sea doesn't pay any attention to seasons, does it? No. Don't you plan on getting up today, Doctor? No, you can send the patients up here. [CHUCKLES] Especially that Miss Cunningham, hmm? [CHUCKLES] I can never say my wife doesn't understand me. Oh, you beast, get up out of bed. Besides, if you really want to know, I'm in love, too. You needn't think you've been hiding it. Do you know what he asked me yesterday? To run away with him. You'd better be careful, I just might. No. His mother won't go to his school sports day. So he's asked me to take her place. You know what that means, don't you? Three legged races, sack races, egg and spoon races. Well, I'm good at all that. Don't think old Pete doesn't know it. John, we'll see that old Pete goes to school, won't we? Anything old Pete wants, old Pete can have. To the university? Yes, if he's up to it. You know, I think he's going to be somebody special someday. You can have that little John Carmody Hewitt. I'm betting on Peter. You're not taking much of a risk, are you? Mrs. Hewitt hasn't even produced John Carmody yet. No, but with your help, she's going to. John, I want to say something. It's spring and I'm happy. I know it's spring and I know I'm happy. And I know the reason for my happiness. Our life together. I wish it could go on forever, but... I'm so thankful to have had... To have known... John, have I been a good wife? [GUN FIRING] [CHILDREN CHEERING] Come on, Peter. Come on, Peter, come on. MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER: Now the final item, ladies and gentlemen, is an egg and spoon race in which I hope all the mothers of the fourth form children will take part. Will you come with me inthe egg and spoon race, ma'am? I'd love to. Ellen, would you hold this? Which way do I go? [WOMEN CHATTERING] MAN: Nice straight line. On your marks, set, go. [KIDS LAUGHING] Come on, Laurie. [WOMEN LAUGHING] [CLAPPING] Now you're the champion. We did it together. Congratulations, Peter. MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER: We've come to the end of our entertainment for the day. You having a good time? Lovely. They'll be putting you on the all Cornwall ladies track team, Laura. And we hope you'll come again next year and enjoy yourselves just as much. I always hate to go inside after such a beautiful day. Oh, it's nice inside, too. Besides, it's clouding up. One of those strange English days, overcast but still warm. Mrs. Carmody, Mrs. Carmody. Mrs. Carmody, we won and... Yes, Peter. Would you mind... I mean, would you like to... To have a little celebration with lemon squash and sweet biscuits? That's exactly what I had in mind. Come on, we're invited. [CHILDREN CHEERING] LAURA: Here we go. [CHILDREN CHEERING] And you're in charge of the napkins. Now, all go find a place and sit down. You can't have a party without bright lights. ELLEN: Come on, kids. Here's something wonderful for you. Norman, come on. [LAUGHING] Everybody got some? Would you like a glass of sherry, Ellen? I was afraid I was going to get lemon squash. It's very strong, ma'am, sherry is. It's all right, Peter, I was just going to take a sip. I can play Star of the Eastwith variations, Mrs. Carmody. We'd love to hear you, Phyllis. [PIANO PLAYING] Laurie? Don't, Ellen. Laurie? Lights on in the middle of the day. What's going on in here? BOY: It's a party, Doctor. Oh, I see. Well, the hour has come. John Carmody Hewitt is on the way. You needn't look at me like that, Ellen. Our relationship is purely professional. Ellen, Mrs. Hewitt is a woman who has lost several babies, and she's promised to name this one after John. She's going to be all right, isn't she, John? JOHN: Well, it's three weeks early, but I've got a stake in this one. I'm not going to lose Junior. Laura, come with me, will you? I need another pair of hands out at the farm, and Mrs. Hewitt's a friend of yours. But it's Peter's celebration party. Take Ellie with you. Yes, I forgot. How about it, Ellen? No. I'm not very good with sick people. Well, childbirth's hardly a disease. Come on. I'm just going to get some more things in my bag. Ellie, this means a lot to John and to me. I want you to go. But I think that John should stay here with you. Mrs. Hewitt needs John. I don't. But you... Please? JOHN: Well? I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. Of course I'll go. Without much enthusiasm, huh? John, do you have a minute? I'd like to send Mrs. Hewitt those things I made for the baby. One minute. Where are they? Upstairs in our room. Come on, help me pack. Okay. Here we are. Did you make these? The blanket, yes, not the dresses. They're beautiful, Laura. Well, they have to be beautiful, don't they? They're for young John. You know, I think this is the last. Oh, tell Mrs. Hewitt that I intended to bring these myself, but she got in too big a hurry for me. All right, now I've got to hurry. There, that's for John Carmody Hewitt. Give it to him for me, will you? It's politicians who kiss babies, not doctors. Oh. Right. Let's go, Ellen. I'll go and start the car. Don't wait dinner for us. This might take some time. I know.Bye, kids. ALL: Goodbye. Bye, John. Bye, darling. Run on, Ellie, this is something you can do for me. Run on. Shh, shh. Mrs. Doctor? Peter. You had a drop too much, didn't you? Well, perhaps I did, Peter. I feel a little dizzy. It takes Mum that way. I'll help you upstairs. You'll sleep it off and wake up fine. Peter. Your eyes are better than mine. Tell me what you see. First of all, the land, and some gulls flying around and the water. Is the wind blowing on the water? Not much. There's no white caps. There's a sailing boat. Way far out it gets hazy, but it's a grand bright evening all the same. Open the windows for me, Peter. I'm sleepy now, Peter. Tell the doctor, when you see him, how you helped me. Yes, ma'am. Thanks for the party and helping me win. Good night. Good night, Peter.
