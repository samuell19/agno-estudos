In the HÃ¼rtgen Forest near the Belgian border, the German stronghold known as Hill 400 provides an unimpeded view of Allied movements, ensuring the successful launch of German counterattacks throughout the war. Dense brush means moving through the terrain in tanks is extremely difficult. That along with barbed wire and mines scattered throughout the area is what makes Hill 400 the pinnacle of Germany's vaunted Siegfried line. American forces are now tasked with the difficult duty of attacking a large section of the German army's embedded fortifications along the rear of the Siegfried line. If the American forces are successful, Hill 400 will provide an incalculably valuable observation point over the Rohr River. The U.S. makes many brave attempts to gain control over Hill 400 in the forest containment, but they all fail. A new approach is needed. General Walter Weaver asks V-Corp Commander General Leonard Gerow for Rangers to help in the command to help in the continued assault on Hill 400. The men of the Second Ranger battalion who landed on Omaha Beach and scaled Point du Hoc ensured the Allied victory at D-Day. If anyone can take Hill 400, it's these men. If the 109th can to break through to Schmidt, we might finally get some damn relief. Well, until we can cut through these pine trees, Dutch, there's nothing stopping the enemy from sending reinforcements straight up the Rohr Valley. At east, gentlemen, I'm General Weaver of the Eighth Division. This old warhorse here is General Cota of the 28th. - Second Lieutenant Massney. - First Lieutenant Lomell. We believe the Rangers, Second Battalion, will succeed where so many others have failed in the past. You want us to take Hill 400? I saw you boys scale Pointe du hoc at Omaha. And I saw it first- hand. Some of the finest soldiering I think I've ever seen. Son, we've been stuck in front of this hill for three months. You're our last best chance to break through. You think you can handle it? Show us the way, General. That's what I want to hear. Hill 400 is so named because it's 400 meters high, which makes it something of a mountain for this area. Listen, boys. The Germans have been sending reinforcements here up the Rohr River Valley. Capturing Hill 400 will give us total command of the sector, allowing all the units to the south to break through into the heart of Germany. How does our assault seem any different from the ones that failed? Well, until now, our boys have been trying to navigate forests thick with trees and landmines. By capturing Bergstein, we can approach the hill from this broad field at its base. What kind of opposition are we looking at? Not the starving Polish prisoners you're used to. You'll be facing crack veteran German troops, so expect a slugging match. They have no shortage of artillery, as you know. Also, the Nazis have all the approaches covered with mortar and machine gun fire. So we've got that to look forward to. Well, we brought in several big guns of our own. We've positioned them to the south of the village to provide support. Anticipate fierce counterattacks. If your men can't hold Hill 400, the entire Allied offensive will fail. We won't let you down, General. Dismissed. Hell of a place to spend a birthday, hey Lieutenant? Shh. I can tell already I don't like this place. You can't see in front of you, you can't see behind you. I wouldn't be in such a hurry to find the enemy if I was you. Maybe he gave up and went home. That's what I'd do if I were German. Not looking for Germans. We're looking for the 2nd Battalion of the 112th Infantry. You have to do that? Be a lot more helpful if you pick up a rifle and join in. Take a picture of McHugh. I mean, it's his birthday after all. Leave Anderson alone. I'm just saying. You're not fighting, you have no use to us. You know, HQ wants us to take this hill. But we've got to meet up with the 112th first. The map says it's supposed to be right here. I don't see him. You? You think maybe they took the hill without us? Supposed to be right here, damn it. Incoming! Where's it coming from? All over! 12 o'clock! Ah! That's G.I. gear. Is that from the 112th? Who goes there? G.I.'s. Yeah? Who won the World Series? Wasn't Brooklyn, so what do I care? What's your unit? - 112th. - 112th? We're with the Ranger 2nd. Supposed to meet up with you. Well, consider yourself met. Where are you guys coming from? Hill 400. The Meat Grinder. Your objective. Fuck. That could have gone better. See what the Generals have to say up in Bergstein. Let's move out. How's the corned beef, big guy? Great. It's so cold. It tastes like salty ice cream. How come you didn't heat it up? I thought I did. Chow any better back in Normandy? The food in England was the best we ever had. It didn't last long, though. Oh, yeah? The seas were so rough on the boat to Omaha, nobody could keep their breakfast down. For the first time in months, we got fresh eggs, hash, and pancakes. In a half hour, it was spread all over the deck of the landing craft. Rotten luck. Everyone was sliding around. Jeez. What a waste. War is hell. Sir? How long do you think the Krauts are going to hold out for? These ones here? HQ says they've been here three months, so... Who knows? I meant the Germans in general, sir. No idea. I'm done trying to predict things. I say two months tops. Yeah, right. Between the Russians on one side, us and the Brits on the other, Huns will be squeezed like grapes. Then why did they hang out this long? Matter of topography. Once we're flat over the hill, straight on to Berlin. We had a teacher like you back home. Wise, handsome? He was full of crap. I forgot, sir. You were a principal, weren't you? That's right. Washington High School, Finlay, Ohio. Can I ask you something, sir? Sure. Were you a nice principal? Were you a mean principal? - You ever paddle a kid? - Nope. Was a nice principal. I don't believe in corporal punishment. I'd rather punish corporals. Good one, sir. You can use it anytime. Thank you, sir. I think we've got about a hundred yards till we've reached the end. See that gunner's nest at the base of the hill? Yeah. That's our objective. Across exposed ground? Either that... or the minefields on either side. Open field it is. Damn it, Anderson. Keep snapping pictures with your head up. Hey, you got a muzzle on that thing? I'm sorry, I'll see what I can do. Look, I know you're not fighting like we are, but you're on the front lines with the rest of us. We're not going to compromise our position for some pretty picture on the cover of Life Magazine. My pictures never make it past the State Department, Lieutenant. Got any to show us? Not the time, Sergeant. Oh, come on. Aren't you curious what your pretty mug looks like? You have some, don't you? Actually, I do. Yeah. Here's one. I don't know. What do you think? That's actually a really nice picture. Thanks, man. Fine. If I see any pictures of Germans, they'd better either be dead or captured. You're a regular Cary Grant, you know that? Keep it. Move! Move! Come on, come on, come on. Come on! Let's go! Move! Get down! Holy moly! Our guns are firing way too close! They're going to kill us with friendly fire! Don't seem too friendly than me! Keep your head down! They'll kill us! Raise them up! Raise the elevation! Five degrees! No! Raise the elevation! Five degrees! Or you'll kill us all! What? Move! Move! Let's go! Let's go! Move! Move! Krauts, 2 o'clock! How are we going to get out of here? We'll need better artillery fire for one thing! They've got to target the German mortars if we're going to take this hill! You mean instead of targeting us! How are we going to take that hill if we can't get out of these woods? Incoming! I haven't dealt with anything this bad since Normandy! At least in Normandy we had destroyers! Go! Glad you could make it! You want to tell those bastards to take it easy on the guns? I couldn't get through! If we can't charge that hill, that means running into our own artillery! 10 o'clock! They need a redirect! Away from the hill and towards those mortar crews! I'm on it, I'm on it! Get down! I know how to duck, you moron. Is it just me or is that mortar getting closer? It's not just you! The Kraut mortar crews are getting our bearings! I'd suggest retreating, but that's where the mortar is landing! I really don't want to die in this forest, Lieutenant! You're not going to die. Come on! Call off the artillery! I'm on it, I'm on it. Call off the artillery! Call it off on our position! Now! I need it now, Goddammit! Forward! Forward! Move! Ah! I've been hit! I got you! You all right? - I've been hit! - Let me see! Let me see! - You'll take this hill! - Yes, sir! Ugh! What? What are you all looking at? So what's next, guys? Check them. Then we'll clear out. We'll get you a medic, Sarge! - Kettlehut, get on that. - Yes, sir. Got you, sarge. So, uh... You okay? Yeah, I'm good. You? All clear, sir. Head out. Let's hole up here and catch our bearings. Any idea where we are? What do you think? Looks like it could be Harschelt. Looks peaceful. A little too peaceful to me. What do you want to do? Let's check it out. Let's go. Let's go, guys. Move out. The house looks abandoned. We can search for supplies. But we need to clear it first. What is it? I thought I saw something in the window. Petty, what would it be? What? Your meal. What would your meal be? It's Spam, isn't it? Something like Spam or shrimp or something? - Shh! - Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! I got a theory. Yeah? Those Krauts in there are just as terrified as the rest of the Germans. They're heavily outnumbered, and they just spent the last five minutes watching their comrades either get killed, or run for the hills. Seems kind of silly to keep fighting, doesn't it? Petty, McHugh, you check the stables. Kettlehut, Anderson, you check the outside. Come on, move! Go! Go! Have you ever been to the World's Fair? No. Oh, yeah. You're too young. I'm not too young. When I went, I met this girl. Beautiful. She bought me the best hot dog I've ever had in my entire life. Had pickles on it and these weird beans, incredible. Now, I've always tried to recreate it... Shut up. Maybe you could get another one. Oh, man. What do we got? Hans? Friedrich? Come! Okay, on three. Shhh. That's for sure. Can you take him? - Take him out. - Okay. Yeah. Shit! Secure the area! Hans? Ah! Think they heard us? Yeah, Red, I think they did. Ah! - Got them. - You got them? - Yeah, all three. - Go check them. Come on. You got one? I think so. - You got it? - Yeah. Ah! Oh, good job, kid. Man... He's down. Good. How many did you get? I got two. Oh, two. Look at you, Pew Pew Petty. I got three. How the hell did you get three? There's only four here. Who knows? Look at them. How'd it go? About as expected. Let's get the hell out of here. Let's get some rest, gents. We hit Hill 400 in the morning. Fire at will! Get down! Go, go, go! Stay alert, fellas! Go, go, go, come on! Petty, you good? Good! Ah! You go, go! Come on, pick up the pace! Move forward, move forward! You good? - Good? - We're good. That's how we do it. Good job. Good job. Good going. How many are we down? 12 dead. 34 wounded. Let's take this damn hill. Get down! Get down! It's right there. We can take it. No. We got to talk strategy. I'll cover you. Go! Go! Go! Go, go, go! Go, go! Go, go, go, go! Okay, this is it. The top of the hill. But they're not going to give it away. Einstein, Sonny. You take the approach to the left. Petty, Red. You take the right. I'll take the forward position. Now I've got to stay out of the view of the Kraut gun. So look for me. Look for me. Okay? On my signal, open up with everything you've got. All right? Now the instant I hit him with my smoke grenade, cease fire. Okay? You got it? All right, let's go. Let's go. Come on. So Pointe du hoc, did you really have a mohawk and put on war paint and everything? I sure did. Seems pretty theatrical. Well, we had to keep ourselves motivated. Wait. What are you saying? Nothing. It just seems like you're more of a... What? I'm a what? You seem like more of a grunt. It's funny. For all their technical advancements, Germany's still very much an agrarian society. You don't say? Yeah. Look at that. Tiger tanks. Rockets and everything. But look around, you'll notice. Still mostly farmland. I wouldn't know. All I've seen in Germany so far is a few burnt-out villages and a couple of pillboxes. I'll show you who's a grunt if you don't shut your yap. Grenade! Clear! Go! Go! We took the hill, General. Good to hear. I knew you guys would pull it off. We must have caught them by surprise. I thought they would have run all the way back to Berlin. How are your men holding up? They're suffering. But they're tough. Still, that's a lot of space to cover on this hill with such a small team. Well, you're going to have to figure something out because we won't be able to get you reinforcements until morning. I'll start working on a plan right away, sir. We'll get you all the help we can. Sir? You know, that 109th, they're not encountering the resistance that they expected. But they need support if they're going to have a chance in hell to hold that hill. It's not in the cards, Dutch. What the hell are you talking about? What does that mean? The call came in from division. There's a German armoured battalion north of Harschelt, and if the 109th doesn't face it, we could be surrounded. German armour can't penetrate those woods. Any more than American armour. This battle is about more than just Hill 400, Dutch. Not to these men. Well, these men are professionals. They were told to hold this hill till morning, and by God, they're going to do it. Yeah, well... So what did they say? Well, we're not getting reinforcements. Till tomorrow. Well, we captured Hill 400. When do we break out the champagne? After we hold it. All night? All night. We expect counterattacks. We can expect the Germans that we kicked off this rock to regroup, since this is the most valuable real estate in the Hurtkan forest. They won't be coming alone. So you're saying we're outnumbered? Most certainly. Good to know. It's not even close. And we're expecting veteran German soldiers. Well, we've got the top of the hill. It's surrounded by forests on all sides. And this is that road right there. According to our intel, it runs past the church at the edge of the forest on the way to Bergstein. It's being held on the west by the Germans. It's being pinned back by A, B, and C companies as they secure the town. Now, as long as the rest of the Second Rangers can keep the Germans on their heels, we have our rear covered. But we still have to defend from counterattacks from the north and the east. We don't have enough men to cover this much territory on this hill. You can say that again. Well, we're going to have to send out scouting parties. Here, here, and here. Scouts can find out where the Germans are coming from SO we can concentrate our fire on each counterattack as it occurs. Well, our boys would have to be quick and alert. And we'll have artillery on our side, too. We have guns to the south of Bergstein. Kettlehut can call them in before the Germans even get started. Well, if everything goes according to plan, we might just have a 50% chance of surviving the evening? You're an optimist. That's why I respect you. You taught me a lot of things, Red. Some helped make me a better soldier. Others helped me fulfil my potential as a human being. Uh- huh. This ain't one of those. You might not know that the single greatest threat to grunts like you and me is trench foot. I don't have trench foot. You know why? I'm guessing it's because he washes his feet. It's because I wash my feet. A lot of fellas don't like to because... Because it's about 10 degrees out. And I sympathise. But it doesn't matter. A good soldier takes care of their feet. Noted. Are you serious? I think you'll like it. I got a picture of you three and a tree and... Fred's disgusting feet. I don't mind. That's the best chance I have of making Life magazine. What are you going to do with those pictures anyway? Nothing. Then why? Son, I'm embedded with the U.S. military. I'm taking pictures to record the war. Why does anybody want to look at this shit? So, in theory, it doesn't happen again. Give you an ETA and reinforcements? They said they'd get them here as quick as they could. Some plan. Before a battle, planning is everything. Once the fighting starts, plans are worthless. You just have to make do. Kind of sums up the Rangers. Yeah. That's my whole life. I was supposed to take over the family business. Yeah? What's that? Luxury home furnishings. Is that so? Third largest furniture manufacturer in the city of Chicago. I never pictured you as someone who works with their hands. It's because I don't. Lomells don't make furniture. We run things. I couldn't tell a stop-lap joint from a cross-lap joint. But I can write up one hell of a business prospectus. You studied in college? Business? Nah. Never graduated. After my dad died, it was time for me to step up. I just couldn't do it. So you enlisted? Once the fighting starts, plans are worthless. I like that quote. Good. It's Eisenhower's. Break time's over. Kettlehut, be coming with me. Anderson, you too. You fellas, do whatever Sonny tells you to do. Who wants to hunt Germans? So we're looking for Germans in a forest full of Germans? The point is to find them before they find us. And then what? We report back. Isn't it dangerous if we find Germans? It could be, which is why we have to be... Quiet. Okay, okay. Sorry. I know I can be a real idiot sometimes. It's okay. I've only been with the unit for a few weeks, so I don't have the same instincts as you fellas. You made it this far, didn't you? Only because you're always looking out for me. Listen. Every moment of every day, I worry about every man in this unit. We all do. There's not one of us that would not lay everything down for the fellow standing next to him. I don't look out for you because you're special or because you're helpless. I look out for you because I care just as much as I care about any other dumb son of a bitch in this unit. Come on. I'm seeing a lot of trees. How about you? Are you trying to cheat? Cigarette, comrade? It's American tobacco. If it's good, maybe. Ah! Hey, McHugh! Take it easy, soldier! Take it easy! Take it easy! He's not going to cause you any more trouble. Sorry. I... got a lot on my mind. Come on. I guess we found those Germans you were looking for. No matter what I do, I can never find a Luger. We know the Germans have been holed up on this hill into the east for three months now, fending off one Allied attack after another, so there's no way they're giving up without a fight. So something that would tell us they're whereabouts would be helpful is what you're saying? Any bit of information will do. I got another question. Do you want to pin the medal on me now or wait till the general shows up? Son of a gun! I don't speak German, but I know a map when I see one. Ha- ha! Lomell's got to see this. Looks like we made it through the night, sir. Yeah. Somehow I thought I'd feel better. This thing's fully loaded. Must have cleared them right out. We charged up that hill so damn fast they didn't know what hit them. - Are we in the clear? - No. That means they're coming back. How'd you know? You're not my first infantry assignment. I picked up a couple things along the way. That's one of them. They're coming back? Yep. That's why we'll need a little help. Come on. There she is, boys. Right where they said she'd be. How does that bell tower look for spotting artillery? Like I built it myself. Stop. Thought we cleared out the Germans. No, something ain't right. I know I can't kill you, Anderson, but if you don't put that camera down right now, I'm just going to find a way for you not to wake up. I know you're here to document us, but I can't jeopardise this mission. So you either pick up a rifle, or you get out of the way. He's not going to fight, lieutenant. He's not built that way. He's a geezer. And a fathead. Son, you don't know what you're talking about. And let me tell you something. I'm about as soft as the bottom of your boot. And I've got a job to do, all right? So do I. I'll stay out of your way, Lieutenant. I will stay out of your way. If you don't have an appointment, you'll have to wait. If you want some morphine, we are all out of schnapps. We need to use your bell tower. Did you hear me? You soldiers won't let anything be. My father's farm isn't three kilometres from here. Two years ago, I was birthing calves. Now, whispering promises to young boys as they die. I assume you've come to torture my patients for information. That'd be a war crime. Besides, they're our prisoners now. It's our responsibility to take care of them. What false nobility. Also, I'd appreciate it if we could use your hospital for a while. It's sweet that you make it seem like a request. Ursula. Hans has breathing difficulties. I'll take care of it. Do what you have to do. Just leave us out of it. These men can't harm you, and I'm done trying to make deals with soldiers. Whether you're Americans or Germans, there's no difference. All you do is destroy. These are two companies. That's what it looks like. Our only chance to make it through the night is to hit each Kraut advance in its infancy. Now, we know where they're coming from, so we know where to look. The second they show their faces, we smash them in. It'll be just like Normandy, but with fewer cliffs. Okay, Kettlehut, take Anderson with you. He'll appreciate the view. On it. Now, you fellas, you dig in behind the pillbox. It'll give you a place to go if it gets too hairy. I'm going to call HQ. I'm going to try to get us some more men. Lieutenant General, it's for you. This is Weaver. We just received intelligence that the Germans are launching an attack with two regiments from the east. Okay. I have a handful of men, sir. The rest are either wounded or dead. Unfortunately, conditions on the front haven't changed. Haven't changed, huh? I can't promise we can hold the hill without reinforcements, sir. Well, I can't commit any more men at this point. Anything changes, you'll know immediately. We'll hold on as much as we can, sir. You know damn well things have changed. The 109th has secured the pass toward Schmidt. Hill 400 is the most vulnerable point in the forest. You know, Dutch, that I can't commit any more troops north at this time. These sons of bitches took Nazi bunkers at Omaha when everyone else was soiling their britches. I think they deserve a little help, don't you? I'm responsible for every man up and down the Siegfried Line north of the Ardennes. You know damn well the instant I reinforce any point along the front, I'm putting another unit at risk. The Rangers are outnumbered 10 to 1 up on that hill. The Germans take Hill 400 back, they can roll right back into Bergstein. And it'll be open season on every American in the Rohr Valley for 300 miles. I am not putting any more resources on Hill 400, you understand? They're on their own till tomorrow morning, as ordered. Is that why you're leaving these boys to die on the vine? The Walter Weaver I knew at West Point would do anything to get in the fight. We got the Germans up against the wall, and now you're backing down. It's my call, Dutch. I need to protect all my men, not just one battalion. Is it the men you're protecting, Walter, is it just your reputation? I need to get my patients to an aid station. Sorry, no dice. We should move them now, while there's a break in the fighting. Break? What break? My men are still fighting for control of Bergstein. And then we're waiting for a counterattack any second. Ask any of your patients. They'll confirm it. Any litter moving towards town has no chance. At least send for some plasma or penicillin, anything. Can't make any promises, but I'll see what I can do. I don't need promises from a soldier. I know what they're worth. You know how many men I'm responsible for? I'm no nurse, but I know what it's like to lose someone you're trying to protect. You're right. You're not a nurse. Nurses preserve life, soldiers take it. I hope you never have to take a life to save someone you love. I have never loved someone that much. You always were a hit with the ladies. Look at you. Walking wounded. How you doing, old timer? You know how I got hit in the shoulder? I was there. Same bullet bounced off a rock and hit me in the back of the leg. Can you believe that crap? Then they had me back in the corner as to not upset the Krauts. Just woke up, thought I heard you. But I had to see for myself. Get comfortable. Get some rest. I ain't Catholic, but I'll try. Show yourself, you cowards. Oh, they'll let us know, believe me. I learned that the hard way last time I was in the trenches with you soldiers. Lost my shooting partner. When did you fight, Civil War? Ha. First World War. You think this is the second? That's what Roosevelt's calling it. You friends with him? Why do you ask that? You work for the government. The government's a big operation, kid. I'm just a tiny cog in a big-ass wheel. Incoming! They're coming our way! Gird your loins, fellas! Concentrate fire on... KU-9! KU-9! Stat! Come on, Kettlehut. We're sitting ducks out here. What are you firing at? I don't know. got to shoot at something, let them know we're still here! Stop wasting your ammo! We'll have targets soon enough. Contact! Germans in the trees! What's the hold-up, goddammit? We're concentrating fire on KU-9! Could really use those reinforcements. I'll take that under advisement! Target, 50 yards west! Come on, Kettlehut! Target, 50 yards west! 50 yards west! Useless! I can't do nothing for these boys. Excuse me, nurse. I know these are Krauts and all. Excuse me. They're not on my side, you know, but it looks like you could use some help. I got a vial of morphine. I picked up from a medic. Tucked away in a hidden pocket, that's why you didn't find it earlier. Astrid! Astrid! Go. It's still good. Also, I got this. It's not army regulation, but it'll do in a pinch. That won't be necessary. But keep it around, just in case. We need a break! There's just too many of them! What's the hold-up, God damn it? That's impossible. As long as this cloud cover lasts, air strikes are not an option. And we're looking at three days minimum. That's fine. That's fine, absolutely. You keep blocking that pass through Kall. And we'll be to the Rohr in days, if not hours. Well... Listen, Walt. The 13th's got a German division pinned down at Kall. They can't move forward and they can't move back. If we're going to reinforce Hill 400 now's our chance. We just don't have the reserves you think we have, Dutch. You've heard the reports, the Krauts are throwing crack troops at the Rangers from every point on that God damn hill. If 400 falls, it doesn't matter if we hold the rest of the Hurtgen. Every position is exposed to German artillery. The boys will get overrun without reinforcements. You know better than anyone the importance of taking the fight to the enemy. You got to use every chance you can get. No. Dutch, you're right. We're going to do something now this God damn war is never going to end. We need to contact the 13th and tell them to send over whatever they can spare to the 400. That's all we can do, Walt. I'll try to get in contact with them now if I can. Thank you. - Let's pray that's enough. - Yeah. We're in the shit now! Holy hell, we might survive this. Might. Woo! That's what I call a barrage. Good job, Kettelhut! We got him, fellas. It's not over, though. Not yet. As long as we got those Howitzers behind us, we still got a chance. Take that, you dirty Krauts! Feel better now? Much! We're out! We're out! Let's go! Let's go! Go, go, go! Follow me! Petty, McHugh! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! Petty, McHugh, mount that shit up. Yes, sir. Ooh, hoo hoo. I'm going to get us some reinforcements if it kills me. Make it fast. We'll be back. Good luck, Lieutenant. Keep firing, boys! Turn them into coleslaw! Whoo! On your right! I think you might need to get promoted after this. On your left! Not any more! Whoo! Nice job, boys! I think I've earned a vacation. I need a radio. Hey, my shot! This is Weaver. We need reinforcements yesterday. My men are getting chewed up on this Godforsaken hill. Reinforcements are on the way. When? We won't be able to hold out for another six hours. You won't have to. We've got elements of the 12th Infantry moving to your position right now. They left an hour ago and they're on their way to Bergstein as we speak. How long do you think you guys can hold out? We're outnumbered ten to one. We'll be lucky if we can last another 30 minutes. You listen to me, you keep those Krauts at bay for a half an hour and I'll get you those reinforcements if I have to drive them there myself. We'll do what we can, General. You hang tough, kid. Ranger! You all right? Maybe I should have ducked. Petty! Hey. Hey, you're all right. Ah, Christ. Oh, shit. Hey. I didn't tell you to get down. It's not your job, big fella. Hey, hey, hey. I told you I was going to look out for you. You're going to be all right. You're going to be all right. You're okay. I can look after myself. Petty. Petty. Come on, McHugh. We've got to go. No, we don't. What about him? Don't worry about it. We'll come back and get him. Okay. Okay. Hey, I'm going to come back for you. I'm going to see you really soon. I'm going to see you really soon. You're just going to stay here, all right? Okay. I'm going to be right back. I'm going to be right back. An American officer. What a nice surprise! Stay down, American! You take care of me, I take care of you. Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on, let's go. Thank you. You owe me one. Now get out of my hospital. Ah! Get on your feet. I will not lose another one. Get on your feet. Lomell! Let's go, let's go! Move, move! - Ah! - Move! Move! Move! Come on, go, go! Go, go, go! Come on. Come on. Nurse! Come on. Come on. Astrid! Astrid! You okay? It's nothing. Petty? He didn't make it. Rangers! I just spoke with General Weaver. Help is on the way. He just wants to know one thing. Can we hold out? - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Yes, sir! That's what I told him. Lock and load, gentlemen. All I need is a place to lean. You remember how to kill Nazis? I never forgot. Grab a gun. It's about time! Give me another, sir. Go! Go! Astrid, Astrid! Heads down! You know this is a lost cause, right? What did you do? Come here to cheer me up? I'm just trying to figure a way out of this. Think maybe we could use those wounded German soldiers as leverage or something? Are you kidding me? Those guys out there care less about wounded Krauts than we do. Got to find a way to buy some time. Reinforcements are due any moment. Those reinforcements won't do us any good if we're all dead. Get away from the wall! Oh, God! I'm going to die. Oh, it hurts. It hurts so bad. Am I going to die? You're going to be all right. My legs... I can't feel my legs. No, no, no, you're in a state of shock. It's your nervous system. You've been wounded. It's reacting to a traumatic event. Is that all it is? You are a child of God. If you were dying, I would tell you so. I would never allow you to meet your maker unprepared. Thank you. How they look? Stable for now. But without enough blood or plasma, even these boys won't last long. I think I have a way to get you what you need. Listen, thank you for saving my life earlier. This is war. We all have to do things we don't want to do. This position is indefensible. - Kettlehut! - Lieutenant. Can you get us through to fire command? Right away, sir. Excuse me, nurse. Is there an exit out back anywhere? Yeah, we have two exits on the opposite side. We're going to need litters. You got any? Yeah, but I don't... Hey, boys, I need a steady stream of fire. I don't even care if you hit anything. Just keep the Germans away for five minutes. Anybody here can walk, they walk. Carry the rest. Ursula: Thank you. Astrid! All patients must be moved immediately. I don't get it, bud. What difference does it make if we get everybody outside? We'll be dead either way. You said it yourself. This place is indefensible. Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire! Americans... you have fought bravely and now as it appears, you are out of ammunition. There is no reason to suffer any more loss of life. I implore you to surrender. I assure you we are men of honour and treat all our prisoners according to the laws of the Geneva Convention. Well, they're not answering. We are coming in to discuss your terms of surrender. Confirmed. They're in position. It's a trap! Hurry! Now. Hurry! Hey. Hey, take it easy. We did it. Put your hands where I can see them. I'm, uh... sorry for blowing up your hospital. Don't worry about it. It wasn't the first time. I can't seem to work more than three weeks in a hospital without it blowing up. Maybe this time I find an actual hospital to work out of. Do some real good. You already have. Thank you for everything you did back there. Lieutenant... Keep your head down. I will. And, if you're ever occupying Munich, and want a drink or anything... Hey, wait. What's your name? I'm Ursula. Lomell. Come on, let's go. Anderson, let's go. You got those reinforcements you wanted, huh? Better late than never, General. That was some fine work you've done here. Another remarkable win. Yes, sir. But a close shave, no doubt about it. You boys rest. You'll need the energy if you're going to take Berlin by Christmas. That'd be one hell of a present. The U.S. Army and... ah hell, the people of the free world are in your debt. I'll take that. - General. - Back to you. Cheers, you later.
