No, Raffaella, don't wake me up by whistling. Good morning, my love. Good morning, darling. Yes, we are awake. - Here. Your mother. - Mummy. Mummy. It's me, Raffaella. How are you? Did you sleep well? What? Last night? We went to see a film with the Colossus. A beautiful love story. Giovanni fell asleep right away. Coming back, I got such a feeling, all because of a misunderstanding. I'll tell you about It later. What? The arm is a mystery. No, I don't feel any pain, but It's as though It didn't belong to ma. Imagine It, I have to keep my fingers crossed to Ward off the nerves. We are going down to the sea-side. now to have a look at the new house. Mother ask: If she can come, too. Giovanni says no. Anyway, mummy, we'll meet Wednesday. At the concert. Bye-bye, a kiss from Giovanni. "Rome Chronicle. " Strikes. High fashion. Another arm found In the river. The Po he: risen above safe levels. “The people In the valley are once again threatened by floods.“ Would you think it possible? Each year. Cinema, programs... The parking situation In the middle of Rome becomes more serious every day. “Well-known professor from Vomill kills his wife “with five gunshots.“ - Shall I read It to you? - Go on, road It. “Yesterday at 8:40 In the morning, Fulvio Scenetti, Doctor of Economics, “killed his 28-year-old wife, Elsa Corbucci, with five gunshots, “while they were walking In the Park of Remembrance, “accompanied by a young salesman.“ “There was thick fog In the park and the two presumed lovers “were walking near the War Memorial “when the silence was broken by five gunshots. “The woman, who died a few hours later at San Luigi Hospital, - confided to the police superintendent on duty “that she had never betrayed her husband.“ I think she was being absolutely honest. And the fact that at the point of death, the declared to the superintendent on duty that she had never betrayed her husband proves it. All right, she might have been honest, but all the same, she was having secret meetings with that young man... - They were innocent meetings. - But the husband didn't know. What should the poor wretch have done then, according to you? What poor wretch? She should have been much more honest and told the husband everything, shouldn't the? Yes, and do you think it's right to say to your husband, "I love another man"? I love another man. But, darling, If there was more trust, more honesty, between husband and wife, how many tragedies could be avoided? And everything, you no, would be sorted out in a more civilised manner. But, listen, Giovanni, do you really think that If she'd been more honest, the husband would have understood? Well, I don't know how that husband would have behaved, -but I know exactly what I would have done. - And that is? It is quite simple, I'd have said: “Ramona, darling, “you have been thrown off balance by this man. “Very well, go out with him, got to know him better. 'If It is only an Infatuation, then fine. “If, on the other hand, you are really In love, “then too bad, go with him and that's that.“ Why, that Is typical reasoning for a man who doesn't love his wife. No, It's just that I can't bear den-It, hypocrisy. That's the only civilised way to behave. But that way marriage becomes no more than a lot of hot air. No more than hot air? My darling, If two people stop loving each other, let them separate. Perhaps I believe it because I was brought up by German nuns, and they taught me that sometimes a woman should not tell the whole truth to her husband. Really? And why? Because I say so. To protect the family. Marriage is sacred and indissoluble, and not to be discussed. -'Why can't It be discussed? - Because it can't be discussed, that's that. And what's this? Raffaella, look. Did you name it after me? My darling, what also I: there In my “in? Everything I do, I do for you. Here we are. - Good morning. - How's work progressing? When will you be finished? The house is finished. The painters are here. - And what about the small job? - What small job? Well, it is a small surprise ordered by the gentleman for you. You'll see, madam. A small surprise? What small surprise? - Come on, Raffaella, you'll see now. - But what kind of little surprise is it? Don't tell her. Take a look, madam. - What do you think of It? - Raffaella, look. What Is It? It Is not a fireplace by any chance? Why? Didn't you want a fireplace? - No. Excuse me, foreman, I... Surveyor, madam... Well, surveyor then. I'm very grateful for your consideration, but so far as the fireplace is concerned, I want it big and bustling, out of stone, with a beam. In other words, something like the one in my father's house. But, Raffaella, your father's house was In the mountains. What do I care? I want a warm and inviting house. It's here, my dear foreman, that my husband and I will spend our old-age, If we reach it, In front of a big fireplace, not In front of a chocolate box. - A chocolate box? - That's right, a chocolate box. - It's certainly not a fireplace, all pink. - All right, I understand. - What now? Is he offended? - But of course he's offended. I'm sorry, Baldelli, don't pay attention to her. That's the way she is. Yes, but you must realise that after all that work, It's not pleasant to hear it called a chocolate box. Listen, Baldelli, I don't care about the fireplace, but I had the house built for her. It pleases me to make her happy. - All right, but It will cost more. Whatever the cost. We'll make her happy. But just as she said, big, bustling, out of stone. Like the one her father used to have. Raffaella, he's going to do it. - What are you whistling about? - Whistling? I didn't realise. And now you'll say you're not whistling. I know you, you know? What's on your mind? You know, I was thinking about this morning's discussion. What discussion? About the question of honesty between husband and wife. Well, and what do you say? I was thinking that I'm very lucky, you know, to have a husband like you, who has really taught me everything, because you have an absolutely modern conception of marriage. Can you open this? My dear Raffaella, it's no problem for me to be a modern man, because it's my nature. But, you know, It can also depend on upbringing. You realise that I, too, am a product of my own upbringing. I apply certain guiding principles. I believe in progress and in reason, not in instinct. If you only knew how pleased I am to hear you talk like that. For days and days I've wanted to confide in you, but my courage failed me. Why? Well, because it is something rather delicate. What is so delicate that it can't be confided between husband and wife? Even the most intimate things can be said without reserve. That's the beauty of being married. What's happened to my silly goose? What's happened is that I have fallen for another man. Do you want to know who? I said that I have fallen for another man. Giovanni What have you done? Can't you not see the blood? You are trying to be funny when I cut my finger. I had no intention being funny. I really told you that I've fallen for another man. - And you say it just like that? - And how should I say it? - God, don't you feel well? - No, and leave me alone. - I feel dizzy. - It's nothing. It's your blood pressure. Go away. And don't touch me, you rotten cheat. Do you realise what a shock you've given me? What do you mean fallen for another man? Who Is this man? Don't shout at me. You said that I could confide In you without reserve. You're really not being very consistent. What do you mean, consistent? I want to know who he is, and where you met him, and above all, I want to know one thing, what kind of relationship you've had with him? Say it again. I asked you what kind of relationship you've had with him. What do you take me for? A common prostitute? You can thank God I have rheumatism in my arm. But why, darling? I only asked what your relationship with him was. What relationship? Have you gone mad? What's happened to your brain? Why, he doesn't even know I am interested. No, darling? He doesn't know? No, darling, he doesn't know. He doesn't know. I kept everything locked Inside me. That's why I needed to confide in you. Yes, darling, unburden yourself. Tell me everything. There. has arrived. -'Who has arrived? - Your friend. , look how they love each other. Always in each others arms. Look here, you're quite disgusting. You brought the chicken? Of course, and potatoes. And a pie. What's happened to you? Are you drunk? - It's nothing, It's the some old tooth. But it is dead. Open. Come tomorrow. I'll take it out. - And what did you do to your finger? - Nothing, Mlchele. Just a small cut. By the way, Giovanni, why don't you show Michelle the new house? - It's no use, you know. - , shall I show you the house? But why, do you want me to buy it? It's because we must stay together. God, I've got palpitations. If you only knew. Did you bring the vegetables? - There's enough food for twelve. - Just as well, I'm suddenly so hungry. Raffaella, where are the wetsuits, the nets? - Down in the hut. - That's right. Why are you so absent-minded, my darling? I don't know, darling, sorry. What are you laughing about? You feeling happy? Well, let's say it's a weight off my shoulders, you know. Were you worried about something? Raffaella has not been feeling well for some time. That arm, going all numb, you know. I kept thinking of a nasty illness, a progressive paralysis, I don't know. - And what is it in reality? - Nothing, something to do with nerves, just think. She says that she has fallen in love with another man. Raffaella In love with another man? Go on. Don't make me laugh. It Isn't possible. Why isn't it possible? How can you talk with such Indifference when you love her so much? It Is true that I love her, but what's the use of talking of independence and equality of the sexes, If we behave like petty bourgeois. But, forgive me. When did you learn that Raffaella was in love with another man? Just before you arrived. She told me. Just as I was opening a tin of tuna. "I am in love with someone else," she says. Anything else I might have been prepared for, but not such a shock, as If she were some rotten slut. Do you understand? Listen, Mlchele, as you've already been through this nasty experience, what do you think of it? Well, my situation Is different, you know. I married a tart, whose mother and sisters are tarts. Sooner or later, I'd have had to get used to it. But, look, In the case of Raffaella, the purest and most honest woman I have ever known, I can't make anything of it. Let's just hope it's a temporary thing, what more can I say? Let's hope it is temporary. But meanwhile, what should I do? In my opinion, you shouldn't do anything. On the other hand, a woman honest enough to confess everything to her husband I think, deserves the greatest respect. You think so, Mlchele? Let's take it step by step, Raffaella. What's this young man's name? - His name is Valerio. And what's his job? He's an assistant at the Centre for Nuclear Research. - When did you first meet him? Mother introduced him to me. We see each other every Wednesday at the concert. - Do you meet him alone? - No, Mother's always there. By the way, do you know what he smokes? And how should I know what he smokes? Unless you tell me? These French cigarettes, with the strong smell. I like it when he breathes, you know, It's so scented. Just give the screen a wipe. - Your arm has improved, hasn't it? - Yes, suddenly. It opened up. Thank goodness. Giovanni, I'm sorry I talked so much about him during the trip. So much? You must tell me everything, even the smallest detail. Certainly, It's good to be able to confide and speak openly to each other, because now, you're not only a husband to me, - you're a friend, a brother, a father. - A father? Go on, get in. What are you doing? - I was making you an omelet. - What omelet? You've been beating it for the last half hour. - I was daydreaming. - We must put an end to this. End to what? I can't live in a house with a woman who is thinking about another man. I try not to think about him. But what can I do? My thoughts keep turning to him on their own. Come on, Raffaella. You are behaving like a little girl. You have a ten year-old son. Aren't you ashamed at your age? No, don't say that. What's this got to do with age? It's an Illness. It's like a microbe boring into my head and little by little paralysing the whole of my body. But don't you ever think of the pain you are causing me? Your pain? But surely the pain is all mine. I am the happiest and most serene women on earth, and now all this may suddenly be taken away because of a stranger, who, what's more, doesn't even know that I love him. That's right. Now tell me that you love him, too. Walt. If it's him, tell him I'm not here. - Him who? - Him. Hello, who's speaking? It's you, madam. Your mother. What a relief. Mother, Walt. How are you? We've just come back from the sea. No, nothing In particular, like any other day. Yes, It was fine, but a bit damp. Especially for Giovanni, he is like a child at the sea, you know. Ho dug for winkles with that friend of his. Yes, we had a picnic. As usual, In fact. No, the fireplace was all wrong, but Giovanni promised me he will have it done like Daddy's. Called you? You talked to him? And what did he say? Thank him for the record, but anyway, I'll see him on Wednesday at the concert. No, Mother, not this evening. We're home alone to enjoy a little privacy. We'll watch television in bed. I'll call you tomorrow. What Is it? Did I heard right, you're going to the concert on Wednesday? So you intend to see him again? What do you want to do? Forbid it? I won't forbid it, It is you who must give him up. My darling, can't you understand, It's worse if I don't see him. While on the other hand, getting to know him better may result in total disillusionment. Won't you help me get cured? What's the use of helping you? You always do as you please. Shall I pick up the surveyor? If the fireplace drawings are ready, take them to my wife. Show them to her. - Your lawyer? - How do you do? We arrived this morning from Zurich with the contract. - What about the documents? - Everything is fine. - The guarantors' signatures? - Everything in its place. I'll be with you in five minutes. A signature. How is your father? - My father has died. - Please accept my deepest sympathy. - That's quite all right. - Come in. - You look troubled this morning. - I'm not feeling very well. Come in. I'm sorry I made you Walt. Make yourself comfortable, Mr. Foltzmeyor. - Is the agreement on official paper? - Yes, I took care of the alterations. - We can go to the Ministry for the signature. - Our car is waiting. - Is today Wednesday? - Yes, sir. Wednesday the 26th. - Then I can't go. - Why can't you? There's the concert. I ask you for the red one and you bring me the green one. I tell you that I need a short one for the concert, and you bring me a long one. Why? Thank you. Don't mention it. I brought them all for you, madam. It's you who must decide. What's happening? What is madam doing? Can't you hear her? She is getting ready for the concert. I've never asked you for anything. I help you to wash up. I also do the cleaning. When Sunday comes I even lend you my dress if you are clean out. But why, when I'm about to go out, must you do that me? Don't you realise that today is Wednesday, why don't you help me? Yes, you always, always, always you do as you please, and don't I know it. But why do I have to do everything for myself... And why did the wig suit me in the shop, but not now? What's this? God, who's that? Giovanni, what's happened, what are you doing here? I wasn't feeling very well, you know. But why today? Why today when I have to go the concert? What is it, carnival time? What have you put on your head? Don't look at me then, don't look at me. What's wrong with me? I've got a wig on, but I'm not going to wear it, don't worry. I'm only trying it on. Men shouldn't appear when one is trying things on, I can't go on dressing. - I'm feeling so ill, Raffaella. - It's just your blood pressure. Lie down. Can you not see the mess? I asked her for a dress and she got them all out because it's time to get married. So she does as she pleases. And I have to manage on my own. Because I am alone in this house, alone like a dog. It's no use putting on this dress. It doesn't even suit me. Do you think I don't know it? I have been wearing it for the past four years. There, I know it. How does it look? - I don't know. It seems all right to me. - All right? Can't you see how long it is? And It hangs anyhow. Don't you know the 'what's-its-name' it gives me? Look. But that 'what's-its'-name' is part of you. Nothing to do with the dress. No, It isn't true, I'll throw everything away. I'll give everything to mother. Leave everything to Mother then. There, look. Look what I'm reduced to. I haven't a rag to put on. You've never thought about it before, so why are you worrying? Of course I'm worrying. - But it's nice, really. - Nice? - Can't you see I look like a nun? - But you've always had it. No, dear. I am not a nun and I'll never go the concert in such a dress. Just get it into your head. Good, don't go. We'll stay at home, you can keep me company. I don't feel well. Mother. Mother has arrived. Answer her. There, I know It would end like this, with nobody helping me. I have to go, and I'll have to wear the worst one. Giovanni. What Is Raffaella doing? Tell her to come down straight away, or we'll be late. It isn't as easy as that. She hasn't found the right dress yet. What's that? Why are you pulling that face? Don't you like it? It's a little number. Some little number. It's full of holes. - What do you think, Is it too revealing? - Yes, but it suits you beautifully. Let's go or we'll be late, I don't like to keep people waiting. Llsten to your mother. You rotten schemer. What on earth has happened? What's the idea at this hour? I'll tell you later. Can we come up? I have a group of friends. Mother is here, too. What do you mean, come up? It's midnight, Raffaella. I was asleep. You woke me up. Good evening, madam. What are you talking about? I don't understand. I can't hear a thing. Can't you talk louder? Couldn't you really understand what I was saying to you? We are on the top floor, you were speaking quietly, could I understand? You should have known by intuition. - Know by intuition? What? - That he was there. - Who? - Valerio Mantovani. Llsten, Raffaella, what's got into you? Bringing him home? We were a group of friends, All respectable people. Mother was there, too. What do I care about your mother? I just don't want to know the fellow. This is just foolish. Would you mind? My feet are frozen. Will you warm them? All right, I will. With this short slip, my bottom is frozen, too. Will you make it warm? You try to be clever put on dresses with holes. Thank you, darling, sorry. You now, Giovanni, I never wanted to act secretively. I really must see this fellow, rather than meet him outside in the cold, - I'd prefer him to come to the house. - What on earth are you saying? I am saying it's better you get to know him. Talk to him. Will you stop it? Why should I talk with him? For what reason? Because you're a good psychologist. If you talk with him, you'll understand immediately what type of man he is. Perhaps you'll be able to say to me, “He is not the right man for you." I've had enough of these arguments. I'm fed up. Stop mentioning the fellow. Do you understand? And furthermore, you know what? You won't see him ever again. God, you rotten slut. There, now my leg's going numb, too. I can't even walk. Stop, stop acting. You're wicked. You're ruining my life. If you want to go off with him, all right, go. And don't set foot inside this house again. No, no, darling, don't scold me. Don't scold me now, while I feel so ill. You know that I need you so. Darling, help me. - My Raffaella, don't, darling. - Help me, my darling. - Robertino. - Father, here I am. - Let me. - No, father. I'll carry it. Aren't you happy that your dad sent for you? Yes, but you'll make me miss two days of school. Well, two days of school aren't the end of the world, are they? Tell me, Father, why did you send for me? Mother is ill, you know. What's wrong with Mother? She has strange symptoms. She's always tense and highly strung. Then she becomes numb and crosses her fingers. At night she whistles like a bird and then during the day I find her seated, always beating. - Beating? - Beating. - Beating what? - Beating what? - Everything that makes a noise. - He's she got a temperature? - No, he has no fever. - Did you call a doctor? What doctor? I didn't think it was necessary. Why? What type of illness is it? Father, I don't think I quite understand you. Listen, Robertino. you and I have always talked like two friends, not like father and son. I've never lied to you. I've always told you the truth. I think your Mother has fallen for another man. - And who is this other man? - Some idiot she met at the concert. If mother has fallen in love with him, I don't believe he can be as idiotic as all that. - Look, mother is just the loving sort. - Thank goodness we made it in time. Raffaella. Where are you going? What do you mean? It's Wednesday, I'm going to the concert. Concert, Indeed. Look who's here? What a surprise you've given mummy. But what is this, my darling? - Did you run away from school? - I haven't run away, I was longing to see you. You were longing to see your mother. Did you send for him? - Did I send for you? - No. Are you angry I came? Am I angry? What a thing to say, darling. Look, mummy will make dinner for you now. And I've brought French cheese and champagne. How lovely. Champagne, too. What celebration this evening. You, me, Daddy, the champagne, and what else? - And French cheese. - Lovely. Robertino? Take another from Daddy's. No, don't give champagne to the boy. You know it isn't good for him. Just a drop to celebrate his return. I won't be a minute. Robertino, have some fruit. Mummy will be right back. Cheers, young man. Is the concert over already? How did it go? No, mother, I couldn't come because he arrived unexpectedly. - She won't be long. - It's all right. What? - It's all right. I said, is he there? Listen, thank him for the book and tell him that I've read it and I've found it very interesting. Did you understand? No, Mother, I couldn't come. No, Robertlno had just arrived. He was tired. Mother. Are you upset about not going to the concert? - Of course not, darling, not at all. - Daddy and I could have eaten on our own. No, darling, I wanted to stay with you. Didn't you want to see your friend again? What friend? What did you tell him? What's the point of lying? He's grown up. What? Grown up, indeed. Such things concern only you and me. No, they are things that concern the whole family, and him especially. But how can you talk of such things to a child? You behave irresponsibly, you know. I'm irresponsible? It's you who are. If we can't get on with one another, I don't understand why we go on living together. - And what should we do in your opinion? - Get a separation. Is that what they teach you at boarding school? Did you slap the child? I did that? You slapped the child. It's the first time it's happened to me. I lost my head. Really, how could you? You, who for ten years, have been telling me that one mustn't touch a child. You, who for ten years, have been saying that they must be treated as equals. Robertlno, I'm sorry. I swear it won't happen again. Darling, don't think that we are being selfish. Robertlno, we're concerned about you. mummy and I want to remain together so you have a family. Why did you send me to boarding school then? What do you mean, why? Why? He's right. We've been wrong all along. We must change. - Stop thinking about ourselves. - I've always told you. We've been too selfish. We must think about our son and nothing else. Robertino, I order you to unlock this door. It's unlocked. Sorry, did I hurt you? - Robertino, why are you behaving like this? - Father, what do you want? Robertino, mummy and I have decided not to send you away to school again, but to let you live with us. You have decided? without asking my opinion? And what do you say to it? Sorry, we thought you'd agree. I don't want to leave school In the middle of a year because by changing teachers, I might fall. That's true. What do you suggest than? Why don't I finish school - Then I'll come and live with you. - Goodnight, Robertino. Mummy and I are proud. No, Robertlno. Your visit has been very, very important, for us and for you. We've had a chance to discuss freely, In a civillised and democratic manner, all our problems. Now everything has been solved and you, yourself, must have a clearer idea. Yes, father, but now you'd better go, or you'll be late for the office. But what are you, an old man? Bye. There, run along. Look after yourself. Don't worry. And thank you, thank you again for everything. And forgive me. What on earth are you doing? - That's a load off my mind. What? I've ended that affair with a clean break, forever. Did you write him a letter? I've decided that it's a master-plan. - Sit down and listen. - Let's hear it. “Dear Signor Valerio, forgive me if I get straight to the point. “Of late, my life has been unsettled by something unforeseen. 'I became aware that I was being swept away by a violent passion for you. “A passion that has turned my life upside down. “Something rather like an illness that has affected my innermost being “and has let loose in me all my repressed instincts. "While my husband, poor man," comma, "has become a stranger to me." Well, don't you like it? Forgive me, Raffaella, look me in the eyes. - In the eyes. - Yes, yes, I'm looking. Are you in love with him? Than why tell him so? You have written here a declaration of love. But Giovanni. This matter must be resolved one way or another, or it might be the death of me. Fine. We'll settle it, but let's do it in a different way. All right, you help me then. Go on, dictate it, carry on. - First, write, “Dear Professor. A result of urgent business obligations “which force me to collaborate with my husband at the bank, 'I'm afraid I shall not have time to see you anymore. “Yours faithfully, Raffaella Macchiavelli." And what do you call this? A love letter? For goodness sake, have you made up your mind not to see this chap again? - No, yes. - Yes or no? Then there is no problem and everything is solved. I can't do that, what will he think of me? Let him think what he wants. What do I care? At least use your head, If I disappear to suddenly, he may look for me, or telephone. What will I do then? I know what we'll do, Raffaella. First I'll take off my jacket. Then we will settle ourselves here, calmly and quietly and I'll write the letter, studying each single line together. - And that's all I want, your help. - And I'll help you. - Shall I make you a nice coffee? - All right, you make some coffee. Here we are, this'll fix him. What's this? This is rubbish, away with it. “Dear Professor...“ Look what good coffee I've made for you, strong and black. It will keep us bright and wake. Llsten, Raffaella. Try not to interrupt me, and listen carefully, pay close attention. Yes, darling, begin and I'll listen, all right? “Dear Professor, our meetings on Wednesday afternoons, “which took place in an atmosphere of false enthusiasm “and pseudo intellectualism... “Those walks under the ancient colonnades In a slightly unreal and rarefied atmosphere, “are in complete contradiction to my real nature. “At a time like this, “when man is engaged in solving serious problems “such as hunger and survival, 'I believe it wrong to allow ourselves moments of emotion “and egotistical individualism. “Therefore, dear professor, do not be surprised 'If next Wednesday at the concert “you see beside you not Signore Raffaella, but an empty chair. Farewell.“ - What are you doing? - What am I doing? Can't you see? I'm looking for the fifth letter. That was the best yet. It was the fourth. I tell you it was the fifth one. The fourth is here. And it says, “Dear Valerio. It contains ambiguous phrases, and I don't want him to take me for a whore. - Shut up. - I might as well not live. Go to the first small hotel outside town, take a room, throw myself down, like this, and when you come home, say nothing to you. Raffaella, don't do that. You don't look a bit funny. And watch what you are saying. Do you realise this is pure blackmail? So what I'm doing you think is blackmail, is it? And what about what you did? Bringing the child home precisely on a Wednesday? You knew that I had the concert. Raffaella, I can't stand it anymore. I can't keep my eyes open. I'm dying to sleep. There, look, darling, It's one in the morning. You can't keep your eyes open any longer. We haven't succeeded in writing the letter. You know what we'll do? We'll go to bed now, and on Wednesday I'll go to the concert. What do you say? Darling? Will you let me go to the concert? Go to the concert. - But you'll go with your mother? - Of course, darling, always with mother. - You swear it? - I swear it. - On what? - On what I hold dearest in the whole world. - And who is that? - You. Will you call my mother-In-law for me? - Your mother-In-law. - She's in? - That you, Giovanni? - Yes, It's me. How do you come to be home? - Unfortunately, Giovanni, I think that I'm ill. - What do you mean, ill? Aren't you ashamed to leave Raffaella alone with that fellow? Giovanni, Why do you talk like that? Raffaella knows what she's doing. - Who is it? - I am Madam Raffaella's husband. Excuse me. I'm Giovanni Macchiavelli. How do you do? Happy to meet you. Please come In. This way. Downstairs? I'm afraid it's rather untidy. I just gave your wife a lift home. Her car wouldn't start. - Yes, I know. - It ran out of petrol. Raffaella is always absent-minded, Professor. So I'm very grateful to you. Can I take your coat? Nice here, Isn't it? Yes, these little apartments are provided by the Nuclear Centre for their employees. I'm an assistant at the Centre. - And this is your office? - Yes, office and living quarters. Most Interesting. Please, make yourself comfortable. I like your mother-In-law. I've become good friends with her and also your wife. In fact, we often talk about you. - I know. Actually, that's why I'm here. - Good, tell me. You know, I'm aware of your meetings with Raffaella, because between my wife and I there has always been complete trust. She told me everything about your meetings, and it's worrying me, Professor. Worrying you? But look, those meetings are purely on a friendly basis. I have season tickets and your wife goes there because she's passionately fond of music. Very passionately. She's never understood a thing. She always got bored when I used to put on a classical record. She'd fall asleep, Imagine that. Then why does she go to the concerts? To meet you. Didn't you know? Well, it's a fact. Professor, I'm going to tell you something. My wife has fallen for you. I beg your pardon. Do you realise what you're saying? - Certainly. She told me so. - When? While I was opening a can. Look, I even cut myself. And yet your wife has never made it known to me. She's a very reserved woman, rather shy, perhaps with some complexes. It's always so when anyone falls in love with somebody. I tell you again, Professor, my wife is so infatuated that you could take her to bed whenever you pleased. And I quite understand that as a young man, you could take advantage of this just to satisfy a whim. But for me it would be the and. Listen, I'm ready to help you. - Let's do something. - It's up to you, Professor. You're an scholar, a man of science, and I feel also an sincere person. Professor, I'm in your hands. Who is it? Raffaella? No, it's one of my pupils, who's come for a lesson. Thank goodness. Forgive me, Professor, but I've been in such a state for days. I'm sorry, but I haven't offered you anything. Will you have a drink? - Listen, I'll tell you what we'll do. - Go ahead, Professor. I won't go to the concerts again. - Then I'll stop meeting your wife. - I'm terribly grateful to you. If you like, I'll refund you the money for the season ticket. For heaven's sake, It's no sacrifice. As a matter of fact, to be honest, I'm not so fond of music either. Your mother-In-law persuaded me to buy a season ticket. It's her fault. My mother-In-law's pushing. In fact, If you'll excuse the word, Professor, she's a good and proper bi... - Professor. See who is this? - It's my pupil. May I Introduce you? Dr. Macchievelli, Signorina Orsini. Are all your pupils as pretty as her? I'll be with you In a moment. Then we've agreed. I won't go to the concerts anymore and I'll also avoid meeting your mother-In-law. - I'll be grateful all my life to you, Professor. - Don't mention it. On the contrary, forgive me letting you go, but as you know, it's all work. Some work. Shall I undress? Try to raise your left arm. That's good. Now try to raise the right. Try to raise the right, Raffaella. - Come, raise... - I can't. Please make an effort. But I can't manage it. It's no use, Doctor. Just raise your right leg. - Your right leg, Raffaella. - What do you mean, my right leg? Go on, try a bit harder. - Let's raise it then. - Try, Raffaella. Come on, make an effort. - I can't manage it. - She can't manage it, Doctor. - All right then, try this one. - The left one? For heaven's sake, Raffaella. There, be patient. I'm going to check sensitivity to pain now. - I'll get undressed, shall I? - No, there's no need, madam. - Do you feel that? - Can you feel it? I can't feel anything. - Do you feel anything here? - I don't feel a thing. - Nothing? - Try all you like, I don't feel a thing. She doesn't feel anything. Shall we try your reflexes now? - Shall I undress? - No, madam. It's not necessary. - What's this mania for getting undressed? - But the doctor told me to. He hasn't said a word about it, Isn't that correct? - No, there's no need. - Did you hear? It's not necessary. Now will you please sit on the edge of the bed? - Where? - Come here. Gently, gently, don't overdo it, Raffaella. - You know, Doctor, she overdoes things. - But I can't walk. Of course you can. We're here, Raffaella, we'll support you. There, good. Keep it up. - Don't worry, we'll support you. - No, my legs are giving way. - Nothing wrong with the legs. - The right one's giving way. - They won't support me. - Come on, Raffaella. - Ready, go. - Let's try again. They're giving way. - Raffaella, come on. - A little courage. - I feel exhausted. - Come on, madam. Please. Raffaella, be good. You see how she behaves, Doctor? This is what she always does. - No, I can't make it. Please, help me. - It's as if she were paralysed. - All right, help her onto the bed. - Yes, shall I help her on the bed? - I won't get better. Never. - I understand. Did you hear? What do you make of it, Doctor? Please tell me the truth. It's a paralysis? - It's the end. - Can't you let the doctor speak first? - I know, I know. - She knows. Do you hear her? Of course it isn't paralysis. It is a nervous thing. Tell me, has the madam had an emotional upset lately? I don't know, perhaps the loss of someone dear to her? Actually, there was the loss of a relative to whom she was very attached. Just as I thought. Something vital to her has disappeared and in her subconscious there is something like a desire for self-destruction. And what treatment should she have, doctor? No treatment, all she needs is affection and you, as her husband, must help her and be with her as much as possible in this difficult time. There, Raffaella, we're at the door. Now, gently, gently, watch the step. There, good girl, that's right. Don't rush it, Raffaella, keep upright. - I don't feel well. - Yes, I know, Raffaella. Why make me go out at all costs? Because It's good for you, the air will do you good. - No, It won't do me any good anymore. - Try and make an effort. There, that's fine. - You're so kind. - Don't joke about it. Careful of the step there, come on. - I wonder what illness I've got. - You're not ill at all, the doctor told you so. - I know I'll never get better again. - Of course you'll get better. You must take your mind off things. You mustn't think. Shall I get in through the window? There's a door. - Is it there, darling? - Of course it's there. Easy does it. Gently, relax. There, in we go. Where are my legs? There, put them inside. You know, you can bend them. Right then. If I wronged you, why not tell me? But don't disappear like this. If for no other reason, at least out of politeness. Why not send me a note, a postcard, you rotten pig, “I can't come to the concert“ and everything would have been all right. Come on, Raffaella, please. But why? I call him up and he answers me in a woman's voice. To me. Does he think I'm stupid? For heaven's sake. Who knows? Maybe he has a woman. A girlfriend, a mistress? - He hasn't, what did you say? - Why can't he have a girlfriend? A mistress? Of course he can't have one. I know he hasn't. It could have been one of his pupils who goes there to take lessons, if anything. For heaven's sake, Raffaella, now you're making me angry. What professor would ignore a pupil with miniskirt up to here, in his bedroom, with whiskey already poured out and the record player on as well? But how do you know about those things? - How do I know about those things? - That's right? How do you know about those things? Tell me then, you rotten scoundrel. - What are you doing? - Toll me how you happen to know. Keep your hands off the wheel. - Tell me. - Hands off. Keep the foot off. Tell me. Tell me how you know it. Look what you've done, you mad woman. - Look where we've ended up. - How do you know? - You risked both our lives. - Walt, come on out. Come on out. - How do you know all those things? - Let me go. Were you at his house? Tell me. Yes, I was at his house. You were there? - What did you tell him? - I told him the simple truth. - The simple... - I said to him, “Professor Mantovani, my wife has fallen for you. Please, can you tell me what you think about it?“ - And what did he say then? - Don't make me say unpleasant things. No, now you must tell me what he say to you. You must tell me word for word. - You must tell me. - All right, I'll tell you, word for word. He said to me, “Your wife is nice, but I am not Interested in that way.“ In that way? What does that mean, in that way? It means he is not attracted to you. He thinks of you as a sister. - What did you say? - He thinks of you as a sister. - It hurts. I've broken my hand. - What on earth are you doing, trying to hit like that? Come here, you silly goose, -lot me see what you've done to yourself. - Let me go. Go away. You're making that up to hurt me. Raffaella, be reasonable, try to understand. The best thing you can do is to forget him, especially as he has another woman. What do you mean, another woman? - Who told you that? - I saw her. While I was talking with him, she arrived wearing these boots. She threw herself on the bed as though she was in her own house. Now do you understand? Don't try to compete with her. Why couldn't I compete with her? Because she is a young girl. She's 18, tall, slim, with a pair of legs as long as this. - And what are these then? - Pull down your dress. - What do you call these? Short legs? - Pull down your dress. - I won't pull it down. - There are people. - I won't pull it down. - What a disgrace. I won't pull it down, you miserable traitor, telling me you'd help me, while really you were plotting against me. And you know what I'll say to you? That I love him. I love him. I love him more than before, I love him. And to show you that no-one can compete with me, I'll go there. I'll grab her by the hair, that slut. I'll pull her out of bed and I'll get Into bed there with him. Yes, with him. And then I'll show you how much he thinks of me as a sister. - Come here. - Let me go. - Say you love him again. - Yes, I love him. Whore - Say you love him again. - I don't feel a thing. My head's breaking. For heaven's sake, do you want to kill me? I'm not hitting you hard because I'm controlling myself. Say you love him again. Say it. - Yes, I love him. - There. You sly bitch, I'm not myself anymore. I've turned into an animal. - I'1ro got all blood In my mouth. - I don't glve a damn anymore. Say you love him again. - Yes, I love him. - There. Come here. You rotten slut. I want to go to prison. I want to get a life sentence. I want to kill you. - I haven't finished. - I'm bleeding. No, stop it. - Say you love him again. - Yes, I love him. Stop it. My God, you've hurt me so badly. Mother. O God. You've hurt me. Where are you? Where are you? I love him, I love him. I love him. Where are you? - Giovanni, where are you? - Hero I am. Say you love him again. Say it. No. I don't love him anymore. The affair with that other man is definitely over. How did this miracle happen? Plenty of blows, three broken ribs, four dislocated joints, - bending of the spinal column. - Anything else? - One black eye. - And now? Now she's completely cured. Look how she smiles Raffaella, Look who's here. How nice to see you again. How kind of you. - You are looking very well. - What beautiful roses. Aren't you going to offer Michele anything? At least, ask what he would like. A whiskey for the gentleman. - Heavens, so much to eat. - A lot, you say? You'll see what comes later. Raffaella did all the cooking. - And the fireplace. Look, that's her doing. - Wasn't I right? - Isn't it beautiful? Here in this little corner, Giovanni and I will spend our old age. - Isn't that right, darling? - Of course, darling. Look, he hasn't yet learned how to tie his Shoelaces. Sweet. - You tie them for me then. - I'll do it. There you are. Pass me the ashtray, please. Anything else? Because It'll soon be ready. - Go to warn the guests then. Run along than. - See that, Michele? A lot of blows. - Incredible. Raffaella, I wish you every happiness, with all my heart. I hope you enjoy this house right up to your old age, you deserve it. Raffaella, we've decided to buy a house near here. Then we'll always be together. Good for you. You've made up your minds. Haven't I said it for ages? Let's all get a house by the see where we can spend weekends. Of course. We'll stay together in winter as well. What do we do if it rains or it's cold? We'll sit around the fireplace together with our good wives, a pack of cards, two chickens on the spit, and a good bottle of vintage wine. Tell me, my friends, Is there anything better in life? Is there? Yes, darling, what could be better? For you, madam. - Ho wants to speak to me? - It looks like it. It's Valerio. What shall I do, Giovanni? - What should you do? Take it. - But I don't want to talk to him. - Why don't you want to talk to him? - I'm afraid. - No need to be afraid anymore. Go on. - I'm afraid. Good evening, long time no see, or rather no hear. Excuse the pun, but I'm half deaf. My ear-drum. I've had a bad fall. What? I can't hear. I can't hear a thing. Giovanni, please. Must we have so much noise? Turn it down. There, he's turned it down. I'm sorry to have interrupted you, but Raffaella is on the phone. Could you keep quiet for a second? Been promoted? Congratulations, warmest congratulations. Of course, the world is like that, some go down and... And some go up. Why are you talking In proverbs? Cut it short. Our guests want to dance. What? And when? Yes, of course it was a let down, a sense of bewilderment, but It was only physical attraction, and you know what they say, -out of sight... - Out of mind. All right. - You can talk freely. I'm alone here. - She is alone. What do you mean? So suddenly? And you tell me in that tone? Fortunately, I'm good tempered and things like this leave me completely indifferent. Why, yes, It's best this way. It's over. And If you happen to think of me... If maybe my name comes to mind, consider me dead. The fireworks. Be careful. Don't lean forward. What are you two doing in the dark? What's all this gossip? The fireworks are on. Are you spying on us? - Yes. But what's Raffaella doing? Can't you see? She's eating. Emotion has made her eat four chops, and drink a flask of wine. - Emotion over what? - But don't you understand? Now that she's got over it, he starts telephoning. - All right, but what does he want? - He was insisting, wanting a date. - And what did Raffaella answer? - Why, what should she answer, poor child. Let me give you some advise, Giovanni Take Raffaella away. Take her far away. - Far away where? Anywhere, but do it. Go on a cruise, I don't know, take her to Spain. It's wonderful there. The bullfights are on. The bullfights. But just like that, all of a sudden? - Why not? Can't you? - Yes, I could, -but would Raffaella agree? - Yes, she'll agree. It's she who wants to go. She wants to get far away from him. Because she's afraid it'll start all over again. She's weak. Help her, Giovanni. For your own good and for both your happiness, take her far away. What are you doing here, alone like a dog? You've eaten four pounds of meat, you've drunk a whole flask of wine. Come, Raffaella, our friends are waiting. This celebration is for you. Is it true, Raffaella, that you want to go right away? Far away together? Well, then I'll take my holiday leave and I'll take you wherever you wish. Many happy returns, Raffaella. Well, that's that. - Did you see how happy they were? - Poor Giovanni, he has taken quite a few hard knocks. - So has Raffaella. - He really does need a bit of peace. The fact that your wife decided to go away and leave the man she's in love with Is a sign of a great desire to save her marriage. What a relief your words are to me, Father. After so many months of torment and anxiety, I am a serene and happy man at last, Here, in the middle of the ocean, that fellow has no chance of joining us, and my wife is out of reach of any temptation. But tell me truthfully, since we set sail, have things improved? Well, in one way, yes. But our sexual relationship has deteriorated... For heaven's sake, leave sex out of it. It's just a fixation. Forgive me, Father, don't go away. Where are you going? It may seem a fixation to you, because you are a priest, you aren't married and your office imposes the mortification of the flesh. But I'm a modern man, Father, a materialist and I believe marriage to be based on sexual harmony. What does that mean? I don't understand. You don't understand? I'm trying to say that if I continue to be a good husband, It's because I desire my wife, that is to say, I've a passionate and full-blooded temperament. My wife, on the other hand, whenever I go near her, as soon as I touch her, she grows rigid, freezes and turns into a lump of wood. So you see, Father, I'm not looking for pleasure or enjoyment for its own sake. - Lower your voice. There are children. Nowadays they know everything, these things are taught at school. Imagine, the other night, right at the peak of my love-making, what do you think my wife was doing? She was watching a fly walking on the ceilling. These are things you must solve for yourself. Excuse me, but I have sick people to attend to. I must go and say hello to them. - Can I come with you, Father? - As you like. Then we can continue this discussion on sex. It's very interesting. What can one expect? My wife was brought up in a convent, but lately she's gone off church a bit. - That's bad. Anyway, if she comes to confession, not that I'd ask you, Father, to violate the secrets of the confessional for me. I won't even speak to you If you talk like this. Forgive me, Father, but sometimes I lose my head. Didn't you tell me you were a progressive? Be consistent. - Father Bardella, this Is my wife. - How do you do? - Raffaella, Father Bardella. - Who is he? - He's the ship's chaplain. - How do you do? Where are you going? We're going down to the second class, come with us. No, not second class. No, you can't go. - Why not? - Because I must talk to you. - Well, you can talk to me later. - No, it's urgent. Very urgent. - Go along with your wife. - Goodbye, Father, pleased to have met you. - Excuse me, Father, I'll join you later. - Yes, just as you wish. But what's there so urgent to tell me, Raffaella? How is it that you never understand what I want to say to you? Of course, but couldn't you Wait? - No, of course I couldn't. - But Father Bardella was there. - What are you doing, Raffaella? - I couldn't wait. Of course it can Walt, Raffaella. - I'll undress you completely now. - Yes, darling, undress me. - You won't get away from me, you know. - No, I won't run away from you. I'll make you remember this cruise. - I love these sudden urges you get. - I'll make you remember... - Beautiful, beautiful. - I'll make you remember this cruise. - You gorgeous... - No. Not on the bed. No, I don't want that. - Not on the bed? Where? - On the floor, on the floor. - The floor makes me mad. - On the floor is what I want. - No, you mustn't go away. - I'm shutting it, darling. No. Don't shut it. Other people don't matter to me. - I don't care either. - I want to see you in daylight. Do you require anything further? What? - You. Again? Who can it be? No, Raffaella and I never went out last night. We ate in the cabin. Wonderful, you know. Wonderful. - Who is it? - Father Bardella. - What does he want? - I don't know. What did you say, Father? Father Bardella asks can we have dinner with him tonight, with him and his flock in second class. In second class? No, you can't go to second class. Excuse me, Father. What did you say? Why can't one? Why, don't you know? There are three cases of cholera in second. - Who told you? - Who told me? - Yes. Who told you? - The ship's doctor told me, he's a close friend of mine and it's lucky he told me. Hello, Father. Raffaella and I prefer not to, you know. - Why, don't you know? It's very serious. - No, be quiet. All right Father, we'll talk about it later on deck by the swimming pool. See you later. Raffaella, why don't you want me to tell him? He doesn't know about it. If he doesn't know, It's his hard luck. You should be vaccinated. Surely you'll have to be vaccinated. - We'll have to be vaccinated. We'll all have to be vaccinated. Cholera, that's no joke. I'll warn everybody. - Tell me, Madam Campbell. - Are you sure about this cholera? Well, all I know, madam, is that's what I've heard. But who says so? - Dear, Father Bardella, you've heard? - Forgive me, Doctor Macchiavelli, but what on earth put it into your head to play such a joke? - What joke, Father? - But don't you know? The ship is in chaos, everybody is clamouring to get vaccinated. - Well, they're right. - Listen to what he's saying. - Listen. - As purser, I can guarantee that up to today, no case of infectious disease has been verified aboard ship. Obviously, this rumour has been spread by someone without any sense of responsibility. - I don't understand it. - You don't want to understand. Listen. The first and second class swimming pools will be reopened immediately. - But it's not true. - But it's a serious matter, you know. You've compromised me. I had my whole congregation vaccinated. The officer is denying everything so as not to alarm the passengers, but my wife knows it. She told me there is the cholera In second class. - And who told your wife? - The ship's doctor last night. Then why does your wife go down to second class... - In Second? - I saw her myself, in a miniskirt. Then she's acting like a fool. She warns me, and she goes there herself. Excuse me, Father. Excuse me, Father, Indeed. If one doesn't know how to behave on a voyage... The evacuation drill is about to take place. Passengers are asked to put on the life-jackets found in their cabins and proceed to the designated meeting area to await further instructions. Passengers are asked to put on their life-jackets and to ensure all clasps are secured. Passengers are asked to refrain from smoking in the lifeboats. The end of the drill will be sounded on the ship's main siren. Is this lifeboat number four? - Mrs Davidson, have you seen my wife? - She's over there. So there was cholera in second class? I've seen him. You told me that you wanted to get away from him. I don't understand. I said that I talked just now with your cholera, he is going to Spain to work and we're following him like two bloodhounds. Anaemia-unionism. When he told me on the telephone that he was going away I was beside myself. I felt I was either going to die of grief or I'd love him all my life. Then why didn't you tell me the truth? Because when I told you before you beat me to a pulp and sent me to hospital. And not for the first time, you are beginning to lie, is that right? As sincerity is not appreciated in our family, I had to lie, as all the others do. And as I was taught by the German nuns. Some teaching. But after I'd beaten you up, you were glad to even to tie up my Shoe-laces. I tied your shoe-laces, but I always thought of him, always. Well, then, If you are so much in love with this fellow, why not run off with him rather than take your husband with you? No, because I can't go on without you. I can't do without you. I love you. You rotten slut, I know why. He told me. Because he doesn't want you. What does he know about it? He doesn't know me. When he gets to know me, he'll change his mind. If we realise that we're not made for each other, we'll say goodbye, and that's that. If you're relying on my help, you're mistaken. As soon as the drill's over, I'm packing my bags and leaving this ship. But can't you understand this is my last chance to find out whether I'm mistaken? We are aboard now and I'm not disembarking until I know who I'm in love with. You must realise you are talking foolishly. It's surely not up to you alone to decide. He must agree as well. He told me he doesn't want you. He doesn't even want to see you again. He told you that? It's of no importance. Darling, I want to be honest. I couldn't go on living with you, If I was sure of being in love with him. It's not my fault. I understand. All right then. Hello? Second class, 229, please. What are you doing? Professor Mantovani. We'll invite him to dinner. I won't come to dinner with you two. - Professor Mantovani? My wife and I... - Giovanni, I won't come. ...would like to invite you to dinner with us. We're a group of friends. There will be a lovely Spanish girl, a German. You'll enjoy yourself. Raffaella thanks you, too. At 8 at the bar. You have no dinner jacket? It doesn't matter, Professor, come as you are. 8 at the bar. It's done. - Why did you do it? - Come on, get ready. What will I wear? - Keep still. Why are you jumping about? - I've got cramp. What is it? Why are they looking and laughing? Do I look funny? I don't know, perhaps the dress. It's unusual. - What's unusual about it? - The butterfly. - Is it ugly? - Nothing's wrong with the butterfly, but it's placed on a spot where it moves too much. - I'll tear it off now and leave it all bare. - Don't start that now, Raffaella. You speak German very well. Have you met madam Immaulata Marla Santa de Mio? - Spanish? - Yes, from Seville. - Pleased to meet you. - I am in love with Italy. Would you like an aperitif? Or shall we go straight in to dinner? No, actually, we're waiting for someone. We took the liberty of inviting a friend to our table. - Is he Italian? - Yes, a professor working at the N.A.S.A. of Algaseras. I do enjoy talking to Italians. It's nice, most pleasurable. - Well, let's have an aperitif. - All right, I'll have a Martini. - A glass of red wine. - No, Raffaella, it doesn't agree with you. No, I've got cramp, and it'll Improve my circulation. All right than, just a little. Don't overdo it. 0h, here's our guest. Professor Mantovani, madam Santa de Mio, Herr Bauer. You know my wife, don't you? Why, this gentleman is typically Italian. Forgive me for showing up in this, but I don't possess a dinner jacket. Forget the dinner jacket, you look more handsome like that. Who on earth invited her? - Shall we go and eat? - Yes, we'd better. - Where did you pick her up? The street? - Bo quiet, she understands Italian. - But she's annoying me. Anyway, she's a professor, good family, an ambassador: daughter. Raffaella. Look what a buffet. Marvellous. Please, this way. Here is your table. I had to escape from Germany after the war. I don't hide my ideas. I'm sorry, but my ideas are the exact opposite of yours. It doesn't matter, I'm no longer interested in politics, -Ono must work, work, work. Create. - Exactly so. But pardon me, what do you do? - See my hair? - Yes, I see it. It's bleached. Quite right. I'm a dancer, a choreographer. Lucky you, always among ballerinas and beautiful women. Not interested in ballerinas. Not interested women. I speak sincerely. - Is this your honeymoon? - No. Thanks for the compliment. We had our honeymoon ten years ago. We went to Finland, didn't we, Raffaella? Yes, that was a beautiful trip, really unforgettable. Just imagine, we got as far as the Arctic Circle. And we saw the usual penguins. What penguins? What do you mean, what penguins? The penguins. You see, madam, there are no penguins at the North Pole. What do you mean, no penguins? I saw them. No, madam, it's impossible, penguins Inhabit the South Pole. Look, they were walking in a line, on the snow. There must have been thousands of them. No, madam, you must be mistaken. There are no penguins at the North Pole. - And where do they live, according to you? - I told you before. Pengulns live exclusively at the South Pole. And I've seen them at the North Pole. You tell her, as you know everything. Isn't it possible for a colony of penguins to go from the South Pole to the North Pole? No, madam, it isn't possible. I'm sorry to contradict you, but the North Pole's never seen a penguin. It must have been an exceptional event. Because I assure you, they were there. I swear it. I saw them with my own eyes. I remember it at if it were yesterday. They were walking in a line. You were there. But, Raffaella, I didn't see any penguins and if you keep insisting on it to the señorita, who is a professor of natural history, you'll make us look like fools. So now you are trying to make me sound delusional. But those animals were there, I tell you, and I have witnesses. Perhaps she is a professor, I don't know, but the animals I saw were penguins. Well, if that's what you want to believe, I'm not going to contradict you. Do you see how the professor treats me? Saying "If I want." She said "If you want", meaning if it makes you happy. And she's certainly making me happy and taking me for a fool. But why do you take offence over such a tiny matter? It surprises me. You're a woman with a sense of humour. Why keep on talking about penguins? We're here to enjoy ourselves. Now let's put an end to arguments and let's all go and dance. Would you are to dance? Raffaella? Would you like a dance? Whatever this ship may be short of, It's certainly not short of whores. Why do you say that? She's Spanish. Spanish women are made that way. Naturally, unless they come from the streets, you wouldn't appreciate them. Put it down, Raffaella. Don't drink the wine, you'll feel ill afterwards. What should I do then, In your opinion? Don't look at me with disgust. Why pick on me? I warned you not to lay yourself open to such humiliations. Now I'll show you what I'm capable of. You dance me? - What did you say? - Dance me. She asked if you'd like to dance with her? What are you doing here all alone? Come along, join us. It's no use. Unless you dance, you can't enjoy yourself. It looks as though they've had a bit too much this evening. Yes, my wife's overdone it, too. Whiskey, champagne, wine. And I know how it'll and up later, she'll lose her head. - A game? - That's right, a game's just what I need. You know my wife? Have you seen her, by any chance? - Yes, sir, she was outside. - Outside? My darling. Raffaella. What are you doing? If he thinks he can come up here from second class, he's made a big mistake. I'll go to bed with the first man I meet. Even with the choreographer. Pull yourself together. Can't you see what you are doing to yourself? Forgive me. I'd never have done it. You said you wanted to help me and then you kept on criticising me -with the priest. What's the priest got to do with it? What must I do for you? Tell me, what can I do? I'm desperate. My darling, I'm desperate. It hurts so much, right through to the bone. No one is more desperate than I am. It wouldn't take much, you know. I'll take a couple of pills and I will make you all happy. All of you, all of you. What's happening to us? Raffaella, now you're even talking about dying. I don't care anymore. I want to die. I want to die. My darling, my darling. Don't cry anymore, darling. You know I'm always here for you. Walt here for me. Doctor Macchiavelli, Indeed. This evening you danced with everyone, Professor, couldn't you have had one dance with my wife? I'm sorry, but I don't understand you. I did it for you. And I'm grateful, but on the other hand, Raffaella is out there crying. She's hysterical. Try to understand my position, she's threatening suicide. I'm sorry, tell me how I can help. Please go to her, say something nice to her. Have a little dance with her. Then we'll put her to bed. No, thank you. I don't smoke. - I'm terribly grateful to you. - Don't mention it. Excuse me, waiter. Have you seen my wife, a blond. lady with a butterfly behind her? Yes, she was there in that corner. She wasn't feeling well. She lost consciousness and fainted. - Fainted? - Yes, they took her away. Where has she gone? Look, the fool, she's even lost a shoe. That's It. It's me, Raffaella. Giovanni, they used a stomach pump on you. How do you feel? Do you feel better? It's me, Giovanni. It's Raffaella. Say something to me. - Even If it's only a word. - Whore You see, Father? He's regained consciousness. Yes, I heard him, madam. He is very weak and needs complete rest. - I'll be off, - Yes, Father. Forgive me, please. I never meant to betray you without telling you first. But at a certain point, I lost my head. I didn't realise what I was doing anymore. - I was carried away. - Of course, dear. I know. But now you're yourself again, do you regret it? - Gently. - I know that I love him. I'm sorry. I shouldn't say it now, like this, while you're in this condition. I'm all right, dear. Don't mind the tubes you see in my nose. I want you to choose freely. - What have you decided to do? - I must leave you. - I must go with him. - Well done. The Important thing is to decide everything without rows, like civilised human beings. My I? - Doctor Giovanni Macchiavelli? - That's me, sir. Sit down, please. So you want a permit for your wife? Yes, my wife would like a permit for a three months' stay. For what purpose? As a tourist. To obtaln a three months' permit, you need to give a precise reason. Why didn't you apply for one in Italy? During the voyage on the liner, my wife fell in love with another man and decided to remain In Spain with him. What is this man's name? Is this professor able to guarantee your wife's maintenance? He is an assistant In chemistry at the N.A.S.A. of Algoclm. Furthermore, he has given me an undertaking to assume responsibility for her financially and until such time as my wife and I can obtain a legal separation. And when will you go? Tonight on the 8pm plane for Milan. Fine, wait outside a couple of hours and you'll have your wife's permit. Third apartment on the right. It's you. - How are you? - I'm fine. Forgive me, can you... Can you shut the door? Come in. Sit down here. Pull up the chair. Sorry, throw them down. Come on and sit down here. Your passport. Here's your ticket and your permit for a three months' stay. Thank you, I'm sorry to give you all this trouble. Here are two earrings that I found. - This Is a small check for you. - No, I don't want it. - It might be useful at the beginning. - No, Giovanni, I don't want it. We have nothing else to settle between us. What do you mean “nothing else“? What about the child? Of course, the child. I'd forgotten about him. - You know what I thought? - Yes, tell me. This is what I'd like to arrange for the boy. First of all, tell him the whole truth, nothing must be kept hidden. Yes, of course. I think he should spend the summer holidays with me and Christmas with you, all right? Are you following me? Yes, Christmas with you, and the summer holidays with me. No, Giovanni, the other way round. All right. Now another very important thing. You remember our kitchen? As you go in, what is on the right-hand side? What is there? There is a cupboard with three doors. Inside the door at the bottom there is a small green bottle. Well? And what should I do with it? It's ant poison. You must move it higher up on top of the cupboard. Do you understand? Why? It's dangerous for the child. He might drink it. All right. I've written down everything here. It's a list of things, take it. No, put it in your breast-pocket, or you might forget it. I don't think I have forgotten anything. Do you? the keys to the house. Giovanni. Do you want me to come back with you?
