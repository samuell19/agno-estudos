Haruyama Daikichi Tama. The Island Of Cats "I'm Tama. I'm a cat." "I'm six years and seven months old." "That would be the forties in human years." "The prime of manhood." Tama. "This old man is my guardian" "and servant, Daikichi." "He's looking mightily pleased with himself" "for rustling up a decent breakfast..." "as you can see." "What a simple old man." Is that what you're thinking? Oh, dear. Tama. It's breakfast time for you too. Good morning. Here's your favourite coffee, Yoshie. I managed to wake up again today. Please keep a close eye on Tama and me. You do this every day. Where are you taking me? "This old servant of mine" "is positively useless." "He can't even take a walk without me." Sorry for the trouble. Let's go. —Good morning. —Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, sir. Oh! Satoshi, good morning. —I'll drop by later. —Yeah, thanks. Sure. —Good morning. —Good morning. Come, Tama. Here. Thanks as always. Here. Lucky you, Tama. A feast! Hey, Daikichi. Oh, Iwao. Caught anything? Stay away from me. I'm not giving you any fish. You like Iwao, don't you, Tama? I don't like cats. Cats like you, though. Right? Thanks a lot. Let's go now, Tama. What is it going to be? Good morning. Why is everyone gathered here? Good morning, Daikichi. Good morning, Iwao. —Yeah. —Looks like a shop is opening here. What? Yeah, looks like it. It sure does. I can't wait. I hope it's a convenience store. Makes life easier. Who'd open one on an island full of old people? Then what do you think it is? —No idea. —You can't think of anything. I'm just not interested. You're always so... Tamiko, Tome, that's enough. He's right. Stop bickering. I've had enough of you. Oh, is that so? Leave me alone then. Good grief. It amazes me how they can bicker like that every day. Tell me about it. Anyway, I wonder what this is going to be? Tama? You're so cute! What's your name? Tama? He's not here. He'll come home when he's hungry. Tama? Here, Tama. Tama. Here, Tama. He comes by this way sometimes. Tama. Where is he? Here, Tama. Doctor. Oh, Iwao. And Daikichi. Good morning. How's your knee? Oh, it hurts. My right knee is killing me. What? You said left the other day. In any case, it hurts everywhere. We're old, that's only to be expected. Anything else bothering you? Anything else? Well... I do wish I were smarter. Is that all? You could use with better looks too. Right back at you! Oh yeah, Doctor. Want some fish? Good damselfish. You don't like fish, Doctor? No, I eat them. It's bad for health to be picky about food but when I see their eyes... I just can't take it! Sorry, but no thanks! Young folks these days are no good. What's so scary about fish eyes? The only fish they know is fish fillet. No... say things like that and you'll be called an old geezer. Old geezer? Tama? Is that you? Cats all sound the same. Here, Tama. —So many of them! —An assembly of cats. Tama! So we meet again. Tama! Your name is Tama? This island sure is full of cats! So cute. What a good boy. She scolded you. I see, so she moved here from Tokyo. So I heard. I think her name is Michiko. Michiko. Even her name is pretty. She's opening a café. That sounds so modern. Well, it takes all kinds. But pretty women are very welcome. Hey, Tama... Tama. Why, Tama? Come here. Cats don't like too much attention, you know. And they're a good judge of character. What's that supposed to mean? I see. University, huh? Yeah. Tokyo, huh? A bit more to the right, please. Sure. —Is this good? —Yes, perfect. Oh, no. Oh, it's all right. I don't mind. Hi, there. Today's lunch... is chirashi sushi made from Iwao's damselfish. What's wrong? You seem kind of down. Oh, I know. I'll grill some of these for you later, Tama. So, cheer up. Chirashi sushi with damselfish. Yoshie used to make this all the time. All I did was eat. I never knew this was such a hassle to make. Coming... Coming. Hello? Oh, hello? Dad? Tsuyoshi. I called your mobile but you never answer. Oh, it's probably in a drawer somewhere. Hey, you're supposed to have it with you that's why they're called "mobile". What if something happens? You're not young anymore. Think of your age... Oh, so why did you call? About Mum's second-year memorial. Have you made the arrangements? I can do it if it's hard for you. I can handle it by myself. All right, then. Anyway, carry that mobile with you. It's a simple one made for the elderly. The elderly? Dad? Are you listening? What is it? Oh no! The pot's boiling over! Oh my goodness! Oh no... See you, then. Hey! Hello? How dare he? Treating me like an old man. I managed to make it. It's not the same. Did I forget to add something? Hey! Come on... I can't take my eyes off you for a second. Is it good, Tama? Mi? Mi? Oh, Mi. Here, let's go home. Let's go home. Let's go. Café... Char... ...treux? Hey, it's done! Oh, Tama. So you came with Sachi. I never expected a café. It's no place for old people. I guess not. Please, come in! —Oh, no... —We're too old for... Right... thanks, but... Don't be silly! Everyone is welcome here. Oh, Tama... Tama... Cats too, of course! But it's too... Right? We're too old... Do you have ice cream floats? It's so good. I haven't had this in so long. Nice and cold. It's not bad. What was that? You said you weren't interested. Don't talk to me. Cranky as ever. You won't die in peace. So? I can't wait for my turn to come. Then I won't have to see your face. You're so... Hey... that's enough. Both of you. Your ice cream is melting. Oh, you're right. Michiko, why did you come to this island? People leave all the time but rarely come. There's nothing here. You must be bored. That's not true. This island has so much to offer. Oh, so there you all are. Tamiko. I told you I'd be making a house call. I never agreed to it. You have high blood pressure, you need to... Hello. Doctor? Oh, sorry. —Come in. —Your ice cream's melting. —Good, huh? —It's good. That was love at first sight. Yeah. Everyone adores Michiko. The doctor, Tama... and me, too! Sachi looked happy. What are you bringing that up? Oh, nothing. Oh man... Stop following me! I don't have any fish! You don't like them but they sure do love you! Sheesh... Here. Eat. Go away when you're done. Oh man... Hey, stop fighting! Here. Here. No more left for me. You have a kind heart. I have a soft spot for small creatures. Look. My granddaughter. Almost two years old. "Grandpa..." she says. The apple of my eye. Mine's in high school now... and she's... The mobile phone sits immobile at home. Indeed. —Good morning! —Oh, good morning. A letter for you, Michiko. Thanks. Wow, looks good! —Want some? —Really? Thank you. I'll help myself. —Sure thing. —I'll come again! —See you! —Thanks a lot. I got so many of these but I can't eat them all myself so let's share. You too, Daikichi. For me, too? That's really nice of you, but... what should I do with them? You can cook them with rice. Oh, rice with peas. I love it. My wife used to make it all the time. Is that so? It'd be nice if you had her recipe. Her recipe? Tama... I'm busy here. Not here. Tama! You run away when I offer to play but get in my way when I'm busy. Sheesh... Recipe Book Rice with peas. Oops! The amount of peas should be about one fifth of the rice. Soak the rice for about 30 minutes. Cook with the same amount of water as the soaked rice. Add one teaspoon of salt. Cook over medium heat. Lower the heat after it boils and let it simmer. Turn off the heat after 15 minutes and let it sit for another 15 minutes... It should be ready. and you're done! Smells good! Eat more. Good job! Rice with peas. She used to make it every spring. She always served this with miso soup with clams. Tama, you did well today. Rice with peas Pickled cucumber and daikon radish Fried tofu stuffed with vinegar rice Stewed yellowtail and daikon radish Four pages? It ends here. She must've gotten bored. Yoshie wasn't the type to get bored easily. You'd think there would be more to this. Why don't you fill up the rest, Daikichi? Her recipe book. You want me to add to her recipe book? Good idea! You managed the rice with peas. Yeah, I guess so. Yoshie would like that too. Right? Yeah, you're right. Well, I don't have anything else to do. I could give it a try, I guess... but how do I fill this with recipes? Cooking programmes on TV. How about this? This is the fish Iwao gave me earlier. Impressive. Carpaccio. Car... pa... ccio? Western-style sashimi. It's easy to make. The dishes suddenly got modern from page five! Yoshie will be surprised. —Amazing! —Try it. Excuse me! Where's the fire? I need help! —I told you! —But you didn't come! I did come! You made a mistake! You were wrong! You're all loony! How dare you say that? Hey! What's going on? What is it now? A kitten! I don't want a cat! Tamiko. You could have said no nicely. The doctor was thinking of you. Well... I heard Tamiko was reclusive, so... Why a cat? Animal therapy. Animals have therapeutic benefits. I thought living with a cat might help her improve... Mind your own business. I think she's right. I just wanted to help. Don't ever come here again. Tamiko. Why can't you accept kindness from us? I'm not a people-pleaser like you! What's wrong with that? This is a tiny island Old folks like us need to band together. I don't care. I want to be alone. Tamiko... Are you all right? Miyanoshima Clinic Only scratches and bruises. No broken bones. That's great, Tamiko. You eat lots of fish, you'll be fine. I'm sorry, Tamiko. I shouldn't have meddled. It's all right. Don't worry about it. I'm going home. I had no idea she hated me so much. Tomie and Tamiko are at an impasse. Neither knows how to back down at this point. Tamiko has become more obstinate ever since her husband died. She's lonely. I think having a cat would do her good. But I understand how she feels. I have to live for as long as I can. Don't I, Mi? Right? I'm home. Tama? Oh, here you are. Tama. Tama. You didn't have to see me home. Well, it's pretty late. What harm could come to an old woman like me? I remember you walked me home once. I think... it was before I got married. Did I? I don't recall. The moon was beautiful that night too. You told me about dance halls, Iwao. Said they were big on the mainland. When I said I wanted to go you said, "I'll take you." That made me happy. Those were the days. Have you told our teacher? Yeah. Are you angry? No, I'm not. It's just that... I'm the eldest son. You'll get me wet! Mi... Here you go. Oh! So you're drinking. Thanks for keeping him. No problem. Everyone will help to look after him. Right? That's right. They're everyone's cats. Everyone's cats? They are so cute! I like that! So intent on drinking. Careful! It's sweltering out here. Mum's memorial service went well. I appreciate your coming in this heat. I'm glad to see Iwao and the gang are still the same. Time passes slowly for old people. Are Yoko and Saori doing well? Yeah. So well it's overwhelming sometimes. Yoko started her own cooking class and Saori seems to love high school. She doesn't speak to me much lately. I'm sorry... that they couldn't come. Being busy is a good thing. Oh, by the way if Yoko started her own cooking class I'd love to learn too. Recipes. I've been writing some down after your mother's. Carpaccio You are? Let's try it then. More? I've been learning at the café on the island. Café? There's a café now? It's very modern. Fan this, will you? If you don't cool it you won't get that nice sheen. Wring the fried tofu out and then... —Dad... —Line them up. You really do cook. This is your mum's recipe. The tofu skins have been soaked overnight while the sushi rice was cooked with kelp. This is pretty impressive. It's... not bad. What does that mean? Tastes the same as Mum's. Always lacked a bit of flavour. You're right. But that's what makes it good. No... No, you can't eat this. Tama is such a baby. Mum spoilt him rotten. You're right. I suppose she couldn't help it. She was the one who found him. Dear? Boil some water! For the hot water bottle. The hot water bottle? He might catch a cold. OK, sure. Go... We don't have a spoon or a straw. We'll have to make do with this. OK, over here... He drank some. It's sugar water. Is it good? He drank it. Good boy. Even after she fell sick her expression softened whenever she saw Tama. Tama... I was supposed to pass on before her. Oh, do you want more barley tea? Dad. Come live with me. Tama, too. You can keep cats in Tokyo. Are you staying over tonight? No. I'm taking the evening ferry home. Oh, OK. Tama. Want to come along? Do you? Dad, think about what I said. Shunned again, huh? It's no use. Come here, Tama! Tama! It's no good. By the way, Tsuyoshi is here, right? Yeah, but he went home. To Tokyo? Yeah. Tokyo, huh? By the way, Satoshi why did you choose to stay on the island? Well, I didn't like studying. You were my teacher, you know that. Oh yeah, I remember. And I like cats. I see. —So you like cats? —Yeah. See you! What's on your mind? Is that for Daikichi? Oh, a new recipe for me? No, that's not it, sorry. Satoshi asked me to do something. —Satoshi? —Yes, the postman. Are you jealous, Doctor? No. Just curious. He wants to organise an activity at the grade school. Not just for the kids but for everyone on the island. Some kind of an event. An event? I want it to be something everyone can take part in. How about... a night walk through the cemetery to build courage? A walk through the cemetery? We'll be resting there soon enough. What's so scary about that? How about a bon dance? We've already done that in the summer. I thought it'd be good to get some exercise. Not bad, but... This is harder than I expected. A dance hall. I want... to do a dance hall. A dance hall? That doesn't suit you, Iwao. How's that different from a bon dance? It's... A dance hall is... well... It's more... romantic. I think that's a great idea! We can decorate the gym and set up fancy lights... Let's make a lovely dance hall! I agree! Exercise is good for your health. But we can't dance... Don't worry! Michiko. Will there... be a mirror ball? —We can rent one. —Yay! Romantic Autumn Dance? Michiko from the café came up with it. Make some romantic memories! —Here! —Thanks. I'll see you there! What the heck? Things sure change with the new folks around. It's dripping. You're such a messy eater. Want to dance? Romantic Memories For You Oh, hey! I got it. Thanks, Iwao. Romantic Autumn Dance Everyone sure is excited about this. Yes. So am I. Tamiko? Tamiko! Pipe down! What do you want? Answer the door if you're in. You're just here to nag? There's an event at the grade school. You should come. You haven't been out much. —I'm not going. —That's not good for you. Come join us. Stay out of my business! It's my business. Who would I bicker with if you're not around? I'll be waiting. A dish that everyone can eat. Curry? No, the smell is a little too strong... Tama. Hold on just a second. Tama... Dialling Dad's Mobile Not again. He's not picking up. He never answers his mobile. What should I do? —Come on, let's go. —OK! Romantic Autumn Dance OK. And now, let's have the music! Romantic Autumn Dance Iwao. A mirror ball! Sweet Potato Sticks Sweetened Rice Balls Rice Cakes — Chestnut / Mushroom Rice cakes, please! Welcome. Is one of each OK? Yes. Work hard. You're our poster cat. Tamiko! You came! I'll leave if I'm a bother. Don't say that. Come and join us! See? Looks good, huh? Chestnut or mushroom? Which do you like? Daikichi and Michiko made them this morning. Rice cakes? Wartime food. The mushroom one is done Western-style with butter. What do you think? I don't care so long as it's edible. —You're so... —What? I'm glad you're well. Ouch! Sorry. I'm really... sorry. Why are you apologising? I should be the one to apologise. Want a beer? Thanks but I shouldn't. It'd make me crave for a cigarette. I'm glad it worked out. The dance hall's a success. Yeah. It's all thanks to you. Since you came, the old folks have pepped up. They're a lot livelier. Thank you so much for that. Although I'm still new here myself. Doctor... why did you come here? What? Me? Well... the former doctor retired. I used to work at a big hospital. The town hall staff told me... that my main job here as a doctor would be issuing death certificates. But I disagree! Living alongside my patients and noticing the small changes in them... Since coming here, I've become... the kind of doctor I've always wanted to be. I still don't like fish though. You're pretty amazing. It's nothing... I... had no particular reason for coming here. I just... felt like... I was gradually being crushed. After coming here I finally feel whole again. Also, I love cats. Iwao. Thank you. I'm... finally at a dance hall. After getting married I did housework raised the kids and before I knew it, I'd grown old. But... I'm... really happy tonight. In Mourning Sachi... I've gotten used to funerals but this one really hurts. One moment she was sick and the next she was gone. Doctor. She wasn't in pain, was she? No, she wasn't. Good. I'm glad to hear that. The cat. Cat? Sachi's cat, Mi. What should we do about her? Sachi... treated Mi like a princess. I could look after her. No... Iwao should. Iwao's the best person to do it. Good idea. Cats love you, Iwao. No... I won't. Why not? Sachi and Mi would want that. I don't want to! Why not? You were so important to Sachi... That's enough. That's enough. Iwao. Don't worry about what happens after you're gone. Even if you die someone else will look after the cat. That's the way it goes. —Hello. —Hello. Here's your mail, Michiko. Thank you. Here you are, Mi. Mi. She's everyone's cat now. I see. Come here, Mi. You dislike me already? Don't worry. She's like that to everyone. Mi. Are you sure? Sorry but ask someone else. To be honest I'd like to keep her. But it's heartbreaking to be left behind. Imagine... being put through that twice. I'm sure cats feel the same. All right... I'm trying to do a little thinking. Boy, you're so carefree I envy you. Time for your breakfast, then. OK... Tama... OK... It's cold. Keep it open, dear. We don't want Tama to be stuck out there. Oh, that's right. He can't open the door himself. Daikichi? Hello? Daikichi, are you in? Daikichi! D-Daikichi! Daikichi! Are you all right? Daikichi! I've run some tests. His heart seems fine. I'll keep an eye on him for today but he should be fine with rest. Right. But... cardiac function does deteriorate with age. I'll write a referral so he can get checked at a hospital. Got it. I'll help you get up. Thanks. You'll be fine. I'm glad. Dad... I really think... you should live with us. I mean it's not safe for you to be living alone. Let me know your decision... the next time I'm here. Tama. Your food is at the usual place. Tama... Tama? Here, Tama. Where are you? Good morning. Good morning. Oh hey, you're alone today? Yeah. Have you seen Tama? No, I haven't. I see. Not here. Tama. Here, Tama. Tama still isn't home? What? How long has it been? Three days now. Three days? Daikichi, when cats disappear, that means... Satoshi, what's with Mi? She comes back home every day. I see. She's guarding Sachi's house. She misses the house where she lived. She doesn't get what we say. They say cats stay close to home... Mi. Tama! You came home! You went and got me fish? Tama... The ferry to the mainland is now boarding. Please follow the instructions given by the crew. The ferry will depart shortly. —Here. —Thanks. This towel... May I keep it? Take care then. Asumi! Asumi! Good luck! Good luck! Tama. Good morning. Hang on a second. Let's eat. Today's omelette... tastes special. Let's go for a walk later. Oh, good morning. Good morning, Daikichi. —Good morning! —Good morning. My son is learning to be a fisherman. Oh, I see! Congratulations. Thank you. Good for you. Yes. Oh, just drop dead! Too bad! I plan on living much longer than you! Someone like you? How embarrassing. I don't go out in the mornings! Well, you should! My legs and knees hurt so I can't! —How's your head? —My head? Oh, shut up! I'm way more clearheaded than you! No way. You forgot the other day. —What did I forget? —We promised to... Good girl. Good. Eat up. Good girl, Mi. She let me pet her! That's great! —Mi. —Good for you! OK... I'm on a roll, so Tama... Here, Tama. You need more practice. I see. You can keep cats in Tokyo too, you know. I know that. But... Tama and I both prefer to be here. Recipe Book Is this the recipe book you told me about? Yeah. You... wrote all of these? I came up with some of the recipes. Got some from the newspapers too. But for the most part I learnt them from my neighbours. Was that too much? Here goes. Looks good! —Doesn't it? —How's this? No good. What are you doing? —Should I put more in? —Is this OK? —A bit more. —I'll put in some more. —Oh, that's good! —You're good at this! I managed to do it because I asked everyone for help and they helped. Tama and I... we'll get by somehow. I'm still worried. I know. But I guess... that's the way it has to be. If you leave the island... both you... and Tama... would be miserable. Recipe Book 2 Daikichi. How are you? Thanks to you the medication is working like a charm. Your checkup results were good. I'm relieved. You should take care too, Doctor. I will. I'll make a house call tomorrow. Thank you. Yes. See you. So young. The best is yet to come. Right, Tama? Tama. Here, Tama.
