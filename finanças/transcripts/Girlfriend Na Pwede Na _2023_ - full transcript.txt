Smile, Jiggylabs. One more. Let's do a wacky one. So good! I think that's good enough. I'm just so proud of you, Jiggylabs. The movie's so good. You think so? Yes. So, what are your comments, since this is the first time you've seen it? Did you like the editing? Because I felt like it could have been tighter. Also, what are your thoughts on the non-diegetic epilogue? Well, it made me cry. That's it? Yeah, and it's great. Because you directed it. That's why they gave you the award for Best Director. You're so good! Best Director. Director, I saw your movie and I loved it! You're going to win more awards in the future, for sure. Hey, thanks. See? They think you're going to win all the awards. Let's have our pictures taken here, later, after they've given you your trophies. Come on, let's take more pictures! So proud of you. I'm so proud of you. There, there! One last picture. Congrats, Jiggs! Thanks, Tin! - Congrats to you too, sis! - Congrats, Director! A Beautiful Decay won all the awards tonight. Director! Smile for the cameras, please! Let me hold on to those so you can do your interviews. Thank you, Pamilabs. Director Jiggs, you seem to be on a roll lately. This is only your second movie, and you've already won Best Director. Is there any secret to your success? Any inspiration perhaps? It's me! He's going to say my name! A lot of people inspire me to be better at my craft. My family, my friends, film school buddies. The crew of course. And the actors who worked with me on this film. But of course, my number one inspiration... Is Mr. Cuadra. My high school history teacher. - Shout out to him. - Fuck. He acknowledged everyone, even his fucking high school teacher. But not even a nudge in my direction? What the hell?! Maybe he feels like it goes without saying since you already know it. Congratulations, Director. - Thank you, Ms...? - Mica Dominguez. Creative Manager of Golden Star. Director, I noticed that your last scene felt very reminiscent of Lars Von Trier and his work. Is that intentional? - Who is that? - Oh wow. I'm very surprised, because of all the people who have seen the movie, you're the only one who noticed. And yes, I was greatly influenced by Lars Von Trier. She's acting too familiar. Why don't I just hit her with this trophy? It's very Dancer in the Dark, no? Did you pick up on that too? Dancer? What dancer? Miss Dominguez, we have an intimate celebration after this. You should go, so we can talk about Lars Von Trier, and which of his movies is the best. And so you can get to know me better. So, see you there? We'd surely get around to talking and... I really do want to work with you too... Soon. See you soon? - Tin. - Sis? You'd better stop me, or I'll end up clocking this bitch. Just think of it as an opportunity. What opportunity? Hi. Ah... Lars Von Trier. Who is he? Have you heard of him? I haven't. That's why I looked stupid earlier. Stupid? Uncle Lhar, the reporter, is the only Lhar I know. Because he keeps me posted on what's going on in showbiz. So what if you don't know who they're talking about? Remember, if it weren't for you, Jiggs wouldn't have his movie. No, he wouldn't. And besides, you've always believed, since college, that he was going to be a great director. Yeah, didn't you produce his first short film? And his first entry into the Cinemasigla Film Festival? I feel like this is his big break. Good! So then he can propose to you, Pam. You've been together for so long and he still hasn't proposed. Maybe a big-time movie deal is all he's been waiting for. That is if no one else swoops in and steals him from you. So, are you joining Golden Star? They offered me a three-picture contract. That's a great deal. Yeah. That's going to lead to more projects. Don't forget us when you become a blockbuster director. So, what's your plan? Just to keep making movies. I mean, in your life? Like, your long-term plan? Huh? So, when are you getting married to Pam? Where did that come from? You've been together for so long. Are you still having doubts? - She's all right... - All right? I mean, what if... What if a better girl comes along? Why? You think Pam's not wife material? Pam's all right, I guess... But she's more like a so-so girlfriend. A so-so girlfriend?! So what, am I not enough, huh Jiggs?! Jiggs, why are you stringing me along? Don't treat me like some spare chick. If it's me, then it's me. If not... Don't make me choose right now. Why? Is it so hard? The answer's quite simple. No, it's not! I was just bluffing. I didn't think he'd agree to it. I thought he was going to stop me. Don't ask for a breakup when you don't want one! But why did it end up in a breakup? Is he seeing someone else? That bitch from Golden Star? Huh! I knew it! I was just asking him, but he got so triggered. And it was such an easy question to answer. So simple! It's not that simple! I'm on a different level now. And honestly, you can't keep up. You don't even know who Lars Von Trier is! So this is all because I don't know Lars Von Trapp?! Lars Von Trier! Whoever the fuck he is! Pam. We want different things now. Filmmaking is my world now. And I can't be a part of that world? Huh? Does it have a different moon and stars, huh, Jiggs? Jiggs, isn't this our dream? I have always been there for you. Helping you. What are you talking about? I'm the one who took you to whatever fucked up world it is that you're in now. So, what am I? Just a freaking space shuttle?! Pam... I'm sorry. Huh? But I think we need to break up. I'm sorry. Fine, then leave! Get the hell out of here! You're going to leave me like this?! Go to hell! Jiggs? Jiggs, come back here! Jiggs! Jiggs! Whatever! Have fun with Lars Von Trapp! Lars Von Trier! Fuck. He left me for Lars Von Trapp! Von Trier! Whoever the fuck he is! I think his ego is just inflated. Just let him be. I promise, tomorrow he'll come running back. Men just need someone to make them realize that you're more than enough! How? How will Jiggs realize that? That I'm great? That I'm enough? That I am worth it? That I am okay? Just me being me. I promise you, once he sees somebody showering you with attention, I swear, he'll want to get back together. Agree. Men are competitive by nature. So you're saying that Jiggs will get back together with Pam if she looks for another guy? How? Like it's that easy to look for a guy these days. Leave it to me, sis! Sisters, meet Chris! He's quite the expert at pretending to be someone he's not. Are you sure this is okay? Of course, all I have to do is pretend that I'm your new boyfriend in order to make your ex jealous, right? Meet Olsen. He's willing to do it for 1000 pesos. But there's a catch. He's only available till 9 p.m. 8:00 p.m., Gene. Yeah, so there's a cut-off. For his work. This Emilio J. Kawit. Or, EJK. EJK? As in, extrajudicial killings? How deadly! That's not the only thing that's deadly. Show us your "thing"! Is he your boyfriend?! What the hell, Christina?! I told you to just study and not to have boyfriends. - So, you want to get hitched ahead of me?! - Calm down, sis! Sis! This is for you! Are you single? No commitments? There is someone. - We've been together for a long time. - How long? - Ten years. - Then why haven't you proposed to her? On paydays, I can't be late. That's our big night. Where do you work at? A call center? Let me answer that. He performs at a bar. Oh, a performer! Are you a singer? A stand-up comedian? Are you in a band? He's a dancer. At a gay bar that I frequent. You're a stripper?! Don't be judgmental! Why haven't you married your girlfriend after ten years? What, she's not good enough for you? Huh?! Sis, calm down. We can't get married because... There's no gay marriage in the Philippines. - You're gay? - You have a problem with that? He's a vocalist, a painter, and a poet. You said you wanted an artist? Well, there he is! He's an artist all right, but that's the only thing he has over Jiggs. But wait, let's give him a chance. Why don't you perform for us? Mom? I'm home. And I brought some noodles. Mom? Are you okay? Mom?! - He's got quite the acting chops! - Mom! Right? Does he have a "big night"? Huh? - Isn't he a great dancer? - Hey! Hey! Sis, come on! He has the biggest of all "big nights". Show us what you've got! Yes, right? No, that's enough performances. He won't need to perform. I'll take his "big night." - Huh? - What?! Bye! Thank you EJK! We'll see you at your gig! Guys, Jiggs won't be threatened by these guys. He'll only feel threatened by smart, rich, and creative artists. That's it. What? A rich artist? We're never going to find that. And good-looking as well? There's no one like that. That's only in your imagination. Well then, maybe another time. - Scoot over there. - Another time. Let's stop this. There must be some other way for Jiggs and me to get back together. Not like this. If there's no one like that, what if we just create one? It would have to be foolproof. Jiggs cannot know that Pam's new boyfriend has a fake personality. No, no, no. That's impossible, Gene, we can't do that. I have a lot of orders that I need to fulfill. I think I should just focus on my business. Let's drop this. Girl, as if you can. I don't believe you. We can do this. You just need to trust us. If we can't find the right guy in bars, let's hit the streets! Gay bars? The streets? You better believe it. Some quality men are found on the streets. Carrot Man, Chicharron Man, Water Man, and Cabbage Man were discovered on the streets! Who the hell is Cabbage Man? Cabbage Man was trending on TikTok for a while. But does he have a big dick? What are we doing here, Gene? This is where we will find the man who will... Rob us! What the hell?! What, no, it's safe here. I always come here. Pam, this is where I found your would-be boyfriend. Presenting... 'Buko Man'! Just one more passenger! Anyone who's single and loveless out there? Let's go! Isn't he too young for my sister? Not the barker, silly. The coconut seller. Coconut seller?! Well, there's nothing wrong with selling coconuts. That's an honorable job but... I guess someone selling coconuts is better than someone... Selling his cock. Watch your filthy mouth! There's a kid here. What? She's not a kid anymore! So, Pam? Is this okay? Look, he's perfect. All he needs is a shower and a fresh set of clothes and we can pass him off as this rich artist guy. Hey, Isko, can I have one coconut? Damn, it's hot! Isko? He's muscular. Tall. Dark. And hand... And dirty! Perfect! That's what's fashionable these days. Dirtylicious men. Gene, this is not going to work. - Wait! - Let's just go. - Pam, wait! - Before he attacks us with his bolo. Sis, I'm home! Oh, that's a lot. Do you have class tomorrow? In the afternoon. Tin, withdraw the payments from these orders and send them to Mom, okay? Now filming? That soon? Jiggs has a new movie? Yeah. This looks like it's with... With... Golden Star. Mm-hmm. Oh! Then he's hit the mainstream. Isn't she the girl from Cinemasigla? Son of a bitch. That's her right? Yup. That's her. Ma'am! Here's your change. Thanks. Hey. What are you doing, milling about? Have you eaten? - Not yet. - Come here. Can you give her something to eat? Whatever she wants, just put it on my tab. Choose what you want. Hey Isko! What's up? How's school? I think I aced my exam. Nice! I like it when you say you're doing great at school. Because of that, I'm increasing your allowance. Thanks, man. Hi Isko! I'm Gene. We need your help. Huh? Are you here to borrow money? Like, for a bus fare to go to the province? Just go to the authorities. I've seen that con play out so many times. Hey? What con? Do we look like con artists? And we don't need money for a bus fare. I drive my own car. Wow! Good for you! So what do you need then? Gas money? Isko, come on. Help us. It's quite a simple task. You just need to pose as Pam's new boyfriend. She's going to be my girlfriend? No one's going to buy that. Why? My girlfriend is actually hot. What a jerk! Sis? Come on, you just need to make her ex-boyfriend jealous, so they get back together. No. Besides, why would you even want to get back together? He left you. I'll pay you. You're just wasting your money. Hey, that's cold, hard cash. Just do it. It's going to help you, your dad, and your younger brother. What? No. I have no intention of being a callboy. I'm not vulgar like that. Hey, do we look like we're vulgar people? Them? No. But you... yeah. You look like you're thirsty for me. - Me?! - Yeah. You think I'm into you? - Isn't it obvious? - The nerve of this guy... Wait, hold up. I don't want to fool anyone. I'm not a good liar. If I wanted to sell myself I would have done it years ago. What, you have something to say? You have high standards? I'm never going to measure up? No, you actually fit the bill. No. I'm not doing it. Go and look for someone else. No, wait! I don't want to fool anyone either. But I'm desperate and I need your help. Okay? You don't know what it feels like to be abandoned. To feel like you're worthless. Like you're a spare chick. Because if you did, you'd know that it hurts. A lot. Don't look at it as if you're fooling someone. Just see it as if you're helping me. Please? Well, it does seem like you need someone who's hot and gorgeous, so... So full of himself. - What? - Nothing. I said, "Yeah, someone hot." So how much? Girls, I heard that Jiggs is almost done with his new movie. Is there going to be a premiere night? Are you invited? Well, surely she is. Huh? Not since the last time. Well, surely she is. So just go to the premiere night and take Isko. Imagine. It's the happiest night for Jiggs, and then he'll see his ex with someone who's... What? With someone who's what? Someone like Isko. Well, you know what? Isko should have something that Jiggs doesn't have, that much I know. Or Isko should be someone that Jiggs aspires to be. Like a film producer. Isko? A film producer? That might work. I'm sure! You want some? - Girls? - Mm? I just got the invitation. - Let's put the plan into action. - Nice! That's it. Do I really have to wear this? I'm not comfortable in formal clothes. It looks like I'm going to my own funeral. I can't even move! You're going to a premiere night, okay? You can't just waltz in there in shorts and a tank shirt. You're playing the role of a rich film producer. Remember that. But rich folks actually wear simple clothes. We need to do this to impress Jiggs. Remember? That's the goal. All right, let's start now. Next! You look like you're Bruno Mars! I look like a giant ball of pubic hair! Next? So... I'm a rapper now? Bitch, motherfucker I've been around the block Anyone who crosses me I slap them with my cock! This is a hold-up, motherfuckers! No, no, no! Do we have other options? This is hot! Don't I look like Dante Gulapa in this? Well great. It's like a big night in a strip club. Oh yeah. Yes! Wow! Oh my God! Hey! Wait up! Wow! So nothing changed? No, you know what? I think you need a facial... Facial renewal. Go ahead, make fun of me. If you keep looking for Mr. Perfect, you'll end up with the ugly one. Hey, why don't we try a mudpack instead? With a sprinkling of prayers. You want some coffee? It's hot. Hey, thanks. I think I need this. Do we really have to watch this? The characters just keep walking around. All this endless walking. It's so boring. You need to be knowledgeable about films. You're a film producer, remember? Don't producers make movies to earn money? Who's going to pay to watch something as boring as this? But this is art. Don't you get it? Well, do you get it? Sure. Oh? So explain to me what the story is about. Just watch, okay? You need to know this. This is why Jiggs left me. Because we don't share the same interests. I don't need you to judge me and remind me of that. Fine. I'll watch it. - How long is this movie? - Eight hours. What?! Eight hours?! That's longer than my sleep! Oh wow! Did you actually finish it? I've tried so many times, but I never get to the end of that movie. You just don't have the patience for it. And it's obvious you're not into it. Not even coffee can keep you awake. Wow. You're the one who was complaining when we started it. Well, I kind of liked it. Especially toward the end. At the 7th hour? That's where we should have started it. - At the end? - Yeah. Good thing you appreciated it. Well, Caloy did say you're quite smart. You just didn't finish college because you had to work. Right? My father was the one selling coconuts. That's how he supported us. But then my Mom got sick. She died. Then my father got sick too. So instead of pushing through with my studies... I decided to take over the coconut stand. So I could send my brother to school. Selling coconuts? That's actually a good business. Very scalable. Yeah, if you have the capital. But don't worry, I'll get there. So is that why you decided to take on this job? Well, it's not just about the money. - Then what? Oh, I think I know... - What? You like me? You have a crush on me? That's why you said yes. - You have a crush on me. - What drugs are you on? Why? Am I ugly? You're not ugly, Pam. But you're not pretty either. I don't have a crush on you, and money's not the reason why I said yes to this. I just know the feeling of not... Being enough for someone. My ex-girlfriend... She cheated on me with a foreigner she met on the Internet. We were together for years. And she just left me and traded me for someone she hasn't even seen in person yet. But I can't blame her. I can't just feed her coconuts all the time. Coconut Juice. Coconut Shake. Coconut Pie. Coconut Ice Cream. She would never have been able to have a great life if she'd married me. But... When I hit the big time... Then she'll regret her decision, for sure. Wow. You know what? I don't know you that well yet, but I can somehow feel that you'll become successful. - Want to know why? - Why? Because as a businesswoman, I have STD. Fuck, you have an STD? Yeah, since I started my business, I've had STD. Who did you get it from? - From my dad. - Shit! Oh, shit, no! Not that kind of STD! It's a different kind of STD! Success Through Determination. That's what I mean by STD. Get your mind out of the gutter. Ah, STD! Yeah. I see, okay. I have something like that too. When it comes to love you must have CRABS. You have crabs?! Not that kind of crabs. Get your mind out of the gutter. CRABS. Care, Resiliency, Affection, Balance, and Support. Wow! Did you just come up with that now? Yeah, I'm pretty smart. Although I may not look it. You're so witty! By the way, I want you to have this. And you have a new name now. You are now Francis Rivera. A Fil-Canadian film producer who's here in the Philippines to look for film projects to finance. You copy? Wow. This is expensive. What if I just run away and sell this? Don't do that. Come on, I'm serious. Tomorrow is the premiere night, okay? Are you ready? I am. Are you? Yeah. Just don't get nervous. Just act normal. Why? Do I look like I'm not normal? No! Just stick to what we taught you. So, can you do this? Of course. - Good! - I can do this! But... I have one favor to ask. If it's okay? Can you just give me the full payment now? Because I know how long this is going to take. And I really need the money now. I want my dad to finally get the operation he needs. Is that okay? Okay. So? Have you talked to him yet? I've been trying. It says "cannot be reached". Maybe his phone battery died. Or maybe you got scammed, girl! I hope not. You know tonight is Jiggs' premiere night. Why did you even pay him in full when he hadn't done the job yet? What if he runs away with your money? No. He won't do that. Isko is an honest guy. Are you sure? You don't even know him that well. Why don't we just go to his house? You know where he lives? Hey. Wait, where's the coconut stand? Excuse me. Hello? Do you know the guy who sells coconuts here? You mean Isko? I haven't seen him for the past few days. Do you know where he lives? Not exactly. But I know he lives somewhere in that direction. Why? Does he owe you money? Something like that. Oh no. He probably went into hiding. He owes a lot of people money. Oh my God, Pam! You've been had. Hi sis! Hi Tin! Hi Gene. Hi beautiful. Wow, are we close? Hey Caloy? Do you know where Isko lives? Of course. Sir Joseph! Is Isko home? He just stepped out to buy something. Are you Isko's dad? I thought his father was sick? Are you Isko's friends? Why don't you come up for some snacks? No, thank you. Where is Isko? He just went to the mall to go on a shopping spree. Oh my God! He's out shopping using your money. - And did he say shopping spree? - No. He just went out to buy something. He'll be back soon. Just wait for him. Hey Pam! Dad! You're all here? What are you doing here? Is there a problem? We've been trying to call you but we can't seem to reach you on your cell phone. Where's the phone I lent you? I left it upstairs. I didn't want to bring it and risk losing it. Are you sure? You didn't sell it? I'll handle this, Dad. Wait, Pam... Are you accusing me of something? Well, I couldn't contact you. And we didn't know where you lived. What if you're a fraud? I mean, you said your dad was sick, and yet here he is. Don't drag my dad into this. Well, isn't that why you took the full payment from me? Because you said your dad needed it? But he seems healthy. He seems okay. Wow! Are you a doctor, Pam? Are you my dad's doctor? Okay, well just to let you know, Doctor Pam... We just came home from the hospital. We had his heart checked. We did an X-ray and an ECG. Do you need the receipt? Some sort of proof? I just asked my dad to go ahead so he can rest while I was out buying his meds and food. What? Did you really think I ran away with your money? Huh? Pam, we're poor. But we don't go around conning people. The thing I hate most is being judged because of money. Because I don't have much of it. I thought you knew that? Here, Pam. Doctor. I've already spent some of it, but I will pay it back, don't worry. I'll even double it. And you're looking for your cell phone? I pawned it off- It's upstairs! I told you I left it there. I'll just send it to you, huh? Caloy? Why don't you see the doctor and her nurses out? Let's go, Doctor Pam. Come on. Careful, Dad. - Wow, gorgeous! - In fairness to you. Belle, this is your fault. It really is. How come? Okay, why don't we just talk to Isko? Tell him you'll pay him double. What, so we can insult him even more? We already accused him of being a fraud. But what about our plans? What we've worked so hard on all this time. It's my fault. I was too quick to judge him. Then just don't go to Jiggs' premiere night. You don't actually need to go, do you? Golden Star sent her an invitation. If she doesn't show up, Jiggs might think Pam is still bitter about the breakup. Then we'll go with you. No, no. I need to do this on my own. Okay? I'll handle it. Pam. Hi. Glad you could make it. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm glad you're here. You're alone? Hi, Pam. This is Francis Rivera. He's Fil-Canadian. Francis, this is Jason Inigo Gatchalian. He's a director. Just call me Jiggs. Nice to meet you. Which part of Canada are you from? Actually, he's from Quebec. You know, they mostly speak French in that region, so let's just talk in Tagalog. Tagalog's fine. That's cool. I can practice my French. So, what brought you here? Jiggs, has the movie not started yet? They might need you inside. It's okay, we have time. I've always wanted to go to Quebec. I've heard it's beautiful there. Actually Jiggs- Yes it is. You should visit. It's my dream to bring my movies to the Toronto Film Festival, too. The last time I was there, they were showing a movie by Lars Von Trier. The House That Jack Built. Wow. Pam, what does Francis do? I'm a producer. Yes, he's a film producer. And he's here to scout for projects he can finance. Filipino movies. You know, going back to his roots and all that. Oh wow, maybe he can produce my passion project? I'm a filmmaker. I would love to collaborate with someone like you. Okay. One moment. I don't know how to answer that. My English and French are limited. I didn't even know you could speak French. Remember my ex? She left me for a French guy. She practiced her French with me before she left. So now I'm all tapped out. That's as much French as I can spew out. The next thing I'm going to spew is vomit. That's fine. I'll take care of this. Jiggs? About your project, we should schedule a pitch meeting. Really? Thank you. Seriously, Pamilabs- I mean, Pam. Thank you. I really appreciate you introducing me to your friend. Okay. Ah, Pam...? Just send me a text. I still have the same number. Okay. Shall we? Jiggs, Francis wants to give you a chance. You need to make a romantic short film. Romance? You know I'm not really fond of that. Yeah, but that's what Francis wants. A romantic short film. I think it's because Francis is in love right now. Pam, I know a lot of producers who want me to make a mainstream movie for them. But not that's not my passion project. You know that. That's why this is what I'm pitching to him. I know. I know. It's that period film with a seaside setting, right? Yes, and there's not a single producer here in the Philippines who would finance it. Can you just make some compromises? I mean, do you really want this opportunity to just pass you by? I just convinced Francis. I'm the only reason you have this chance. Who knows? You might even end up doing a film like your favorite movie. What is it called again?'Moments in A Stolen Dream'? This could just be the beginning. Then you'd end up making more movies. Francis is loaded. He has a lot of money. And I managed to convince him. Fine, I have an idea for a five-to-seven-minute short film. Great. But remember, you have one week. - One week? - Yes. The pre-production stage alone takes that long. That's impossible. Take it or leave it. Francis is busy. I told you, I just convinced him to make the time. Fine. I'll make it work. Okay. See you in one week? Pam. What? Is Francis your boyfriend? Why do you ask? Because I Googled him and I keep getting the same articles about him. From the same unreliable sources. I also checked his Instagram and I don't know... Why? What's wrong with his Instagram? It's just mostly his pictures. I mean, he doesn't even post pictures of you. I mean... I guess what I want to say is, be careful, okay? You don't know him that well. What? You think Francis is going to hurt me? Well, Jiggs. I mean, I've known you for so long... And you still ended up hurting me. - Come on, Pam. - Just kidding. I'm kidding. Come on! Anyway, I'll see you in one week. Okay? I'm kidding, I swear. Let's go. Wait up! Why are you in such a hurry? Where are we going? To Tagaytay? - What?! Tagaytay? - Yeah. There's nothing to see there but the heavy traffic. Let's go to Baguio instead. I haven't been there. You're this old and you've never been to Baguio?! Who are you calling old? So which vacation places have you been to? I've never been on a vacation in my entire life. Poor people don't go on vacations. Okay, fine, let's go to Baguio since you're right, Jiggs' favorite movie was shot there. I think I know that movie! Jolina-Marvin,I Love You... Is That Okay? No, that's not Jiggs' favorite movie. It's Moments from a Stolen Dream. Huh? Who's in it? Well... Christopher de Leon... With... Hilda Koronel. It's directed by Mike de Leon. Right? Yeah. Jiggs has talked about that movie since college. He really loves that movie. - Okay, so it's his favorite? - Yup. But is it your favorite too? Well, I watched the restored version when it came out. That's not what I was asking. I asked if you liked it. - I think I did. - You think? - Yeah. - You might have liked it? - Yeah. - You're not sure? Yeah. But I think I like I Love You... Is That Okay? more. The one with Jolina and Marvin, right? Yeah, that one is more striking. Iconic! But just listen to my story, okay? Fine, what's the story? I really love the visual treatment here, Pamilabs. Especially the Mise-en-scène. Missing scene? What missing scene? The movie's too long already. And there's still a missing scene? Pamilabs, Mise-en-scène. It's a French term. It pertains to the way that the elements are arranged in the scene. Like the actors, the lighting, the framing, the props, and even the costumes. Did you notice the camera movement and the colors? So good! When they're talking about technical film terms, I don't understand them. I feel so stupid. Those award-winning films? I don't know any of them. Even directors that everyday people recognize? I don't know them. That's why Jiggs told me, I don't fit into his world anymore. Well, you don't need to fit into his world. You have your own. Look, you're smart. Resourceful. Capable of anything. You run your own business, right? You don't have to follow anyone else's lead. I just fell in love. Love? I don't think that's love. That's craziness. For once, just follow what your heart truly desires. You're one to talk. You have so much to say. You're quite the nagger. - Come on. You want to go to Baguio, right? - Yes. Then let's go. Carry these for me, will you? - Wait. - What? Do you want to go to Boracay instead? Let's hit the beach. Fuck you. I'm not paying for that. All right, Baguio it is. Are we there yet? No, calm down. You can take a nap. It's going to be a long drive. But I'm not sleepy. Are we in Baguio already? I just told you. We're still in Bulacan. Just take a nap. I'm just asking. I feel like we're getting close. Turn the corner and we'll be in Baguio already, right? No, that would be Pampanga. I'm so excited. - Are we in Baguio already? - Isko. Are we in Baguio already? Yeah, we are. I love you, Baguio! I love you, Baguio! Okay, calm down. Fuck, it smells like smoke. Welcome to Baguio City! It's so cold! It's the car AC, dumbass. Open the window. Fuck, now it's hot. Why is it hot? I thought it was cold here in Baguio. - Son of a bitch! - Fuck! Isko, I'm driving. I'm just excited, Pam. We'll take lots of pictures later. Wow. It's so nice here. The house is massive. It looks like a palace. Amazing. Are we still in the Philippines? It looks like we're in America. How do you know? Have you been to America? Of course not. But we have a TV. Good morning! Welcome to Peredo's Lodging House! Ms. Pam Delos Reyes? - Yep, that's me. - Your room's ready. You mean rooms, plural? I booked two rooms. Two? But, Miss, you only paid for one. No, I booked two rooms. Oh no, I did book just the one. Stop playing dumb. You want this to happen. I know how this is going to play out. You have a thing for me, huh? Don't flatter yourself. This way, ma'am and sir. This is the bathroom. And this right here is your room. Wow. All right, ma'am and sir. I'll leave you so you can rest. Enjoy! Thank you. It's really nice here. I only see places like this on TV. Are the towels free? Yep, they're included. They are? Well fuck, I'm going to have a shower. My first shower in Baguio! Hey! Go to the bathroom, if you want to take a shower! Don't take your clothes off here! Isko! Unbelievable. Son of a bitch! Isko? Isko? Fuck! The water here is too cold! You're just not used to taking baths. Fuck. How am I going to have a shower, Pam? I don't know. Is it really that cold? Yeah! Check it out! Hey! Yeah, it's cold! I get it, it's cold! Okay, let's go! Let's go! What are you wearing? What? What? It's artistic. This is what you wear here because it's cold. All you need is an assault rifle and you'd fit right into the Ang Probinsyano set. This is what Jiggs wants me to wear, so this is what I wear. But do you like it? No. Okay from now on, when you're with me, you're only going to do things that make you happy. - For real? - Yeah. Agreed? Now I have to change! Fine. - All right. Hurry up! - I'll be quick! You'd better be. I really want to explore Baguio! Here we come! Baguio! I want to ride in a boat. - Oh wow, what a big swimming pool! - Oh fuck, you can't swim in there! Why not?! That's not a swimming pool. It's a lake for boating! I'm really excited, Pam! We're doing this for the pictures. Let's act like we're sweet toward each other. For Jiggs. - Kiss my armpits. How's that for sweet? - Ass-hat! Wait, no kissing! Crazy bitch. This one's nice. Yeah, let's buy some souvenirs. I can pick anything? Anything. Let's take a selfie and upload it. So, I told you that they make strawberry-flavored soybean here. Strawberry-flavored ice cream, too. You only get one. The other one's mine. You can't have them both. - Let me try that. - Hey! Delicious! There. Hey, Pam. Idiot! We'll ride together! You're seriously making me pedal on my own? There you go. It's really beautiful here, isn't it? You fit right in. - How so? - Because you're beautiful too. I thought you were going to say, "Because I look like a pine tree." Actually, now that you mention it... You fit right in here too... How so? Your skin is the same color as the dirt on the ground. Wow! Put your arm around me! Rom-com! - Okay. Then afterward, let's go to the... - The...? Cathedral. - The cathedral? - Yes. We're going to hear Mass? Yes, so we really look like a couple. What if we become a real couple? - Hey! - Hey! You're just at a taho date level. Well, with us getting blessed, and all. Where are we going? The cathedral. Hurry up, let's go! Is there no other way? That's too high. You can do this! This is what people do here in Baguio. Come on! It's something like this! It's pretty! So wait, you really are a good dancer? There are a lot of things you don't know about me. I'm not just good at dancing. I'm good at lots of things. Thank you, Pam. Are you happy? Wait, let's take a picture here. I love you Baguio! Hey, thank you. Camp John Hay. It's so nice here, and clean too. So now we're here at Wright Park. Right... Right Park? Is there a Wrong Park? You arrive in Baguio and suddenly the corniness comes out. That's the last one, I promise. - Hey, Isko! - What? I want to see that mansion! Wait, the frame of the picture is only up to here. Why are your hands here? So it looks like we're sweet. Do you want it like this? Okay, fine. Wow. This is for you, Jiggs! Let's go! In your face, Jiggs! Mansion! You look handsome today. Wow! Wow, that was amazing! Thank you, Maxine! Miss Pam, it's your turn now. - Me? - Yep. Yes. Go. Beatbox. I'm in love with this guy But he always keeps me waiting For us to stay together, man I did everything I'm in love with this guy And I kept on hoping Only for him to tell me "Bitch there'll be no wedding" Hey, my beloved, why are you like that? How can you just leave me At the drop of the hat? Whoa! One more! Amazing! That's pretty solid! Cool! Sir Isko, now it's your turn. We're going around in a circle. Okay, my turn. You're going to have to forgive me because I'm a poet and a pretty deep person. So I'll be performing "speaker word" poetry. Spoken word, dummy. Just say spoken word, don't say dummy. Spoken Words. Ready. This is titled, Baguio. Baguio, I adore you. Baguio, I love you. Baguio, you're the cure to a solitary heart's loneliness. Your beauty sears itself to the mind's deepest abyss. Your cold softens even the most turgid cock. Baguio, don't worry, I'll keep coming back. Every night, as we lay down to fuck. How was it? A round of applause! You're shameless! So vulgar! Can't you see there's a kid here?! She's going to grow up soon. That's how I truly feel. Come on. - We're sorry. - Tricia, it's your turn. Look at the stars up there. There seem to be more of them here, and they shine brighter too than in Manila. The moon is bigger here, too. Nah, they're the same size and number as when we're in Manila. So, they're like people too? Pam, do you think... You've changed a lot since... You were with your ex-boyfriend, and now? That's smooth. Why are you bringing up Jiggs? We were just talking about the stars. No, just answer the question. Have you changed significantly from when you were with Jiggs? Yes. No. I think I've stayed the same. But for Jiggs, you're not enough? Well... He's unsure when it comes to me. For Jiggs, I'm... So-so. Well for me, Pam... The Pam before is no different than the Pam beside me now. Your ex-boyfriend and I were looking at the same woman. But Jiggs is seeing someone different. Well, maybe he's just not ready to get married. He's so unfair. Life's unfair. Do you get what I'm saying? Yeah, it's unfair. I wonder why... Why is it that men are the only ones who can propose? Why can't women go after guys they like? Why do women... Always have to just wait. Why can't we just say that this is our moment whenever we want... a moment for ourselves? But, Pam... No one's stopping you. You can do whatever you want. You're the only one responsible and accountable for whatever it is you want to do. Pam, quit staring at me like that. I won't fall in love with you. You really are lusting after me? Huh? You want my sexy body, I see it in your eyes. I'll never have the hots for you, dumbass. Are you sure? Yeah, even if I'm miserable. - How about now? - Nope. Even if you let it hang out. Motherfucker! What's happening?! What's that?! Oh God! Down, boy! Down, boy! I knew it! You really are into me! Excuse me! I know you're sexy, you have a thick ass and you have big boobs. But I don't like you like that. Really? Why do you have a raging hard-on?! Because you were holding on to it! Maybe you're the one who fantasizes about me. Whatever! Do something about it. Go to the bathroom! Take a shower! Yeah, yeah. Don't look! - Wait, I left something. - Motherfucker! Where's my phone? Isko? - You sure? - Yeah, let me. You're carrying that? Yeah, it's not heavy at all. Wow. Okay, let's go. You sure? Yep. So, did you enjoy the trip? Even if we didn't have sex? Dumbass. Of course I enjoyed it. I mean, it really is quite big. - What's quite big? - The pine tree. The pine tree. There are lots of them, here in Baguio. Big pine trees! What about you? Did you enjoy your first time here? Of course. This trip was really worth it. You? What? Was it your first time too to touch a dick? Of course not, fool. It's not my first time. I knew it. You took advantage of me when I was asleep. Of course not, I was sound asleep. I didn't mean to. If you say so... By the way, Pam... I don't want you to think I'm a good-for-nothing jerk. This is for you. - Really? - Yeah, it's for you. For me? You know, for everything. When did you find the time to get this? What could this be? What is it?! - A dick. - What the hell?! What is this?! Don't put that on my face! It might end up inside my mouth. What is this, Isko?! So you'll remember me. When you miss me... Close your eyes. Close them. Feels like Isko, right? Let's go. Because I only had one week to finish this short film, I used existing footage. I hope you like it. Play video. Right now I'm with Pamilabs, and, of course, we're at a new coffee shop that we discovered. So, we're going to try their delicious desserts and their coffee. If I want to tell our love story, I can't start with "Once Upon a Time." Texture? What's the texture? It's smooth like butter. Our favorite painting! Right? So beautiful like my Pamilabs. Thank you so much! Don't mention it. Because what we had wasn't a fairy tale. We didn't have it easy. We started from nothing, and now we have everything. We're here at Cinemasigla, and finally, Pamilabs and I won! Congratulations! Look, look! Jiggylabs just won the award for Best Director. A beautiful bouquet! Look! I really love horror movies. They don't scare me at all. Jiggylabs! Jiggylabs! If I want to tell our love story, I'd delete the part where I hurt you with words. If I want to tell our love story, I would skip to the good part, of you and me being together again. Delicioso! Ours wasn't a storybook romance. But it was real. It was true. - Bye, guys! - Bye! Jiggs, what was that? Pam. I didn't make this video to convince Mr. Rivera to finance my film. And I don't care if you're going to approve this or not. Sorry if I wasted your time. But the truth is... Pam and I were together. Pamilabs, this video is for you. I realized how important you were to me when I lost you. I shouldn't have let you go. And I want to make up for everything I've done to you. You made me who I am today. And I know you were a big part of my past, and I want you. I want you to be part of my future again. Pamilabs. Let's get back together. Congrats, Pam. Mission accomplished. Our deal is done. Your ex has come crawling back to you. And so quickly! And... You should give me a bonus. Isko... How are you feeling? Are you happy? Really happy. Okay. As long as you're happy, I'm happy too. As for the props, I will return them to you. As well as the clothes you lent me. Isko. Thank you. Pamilabs, there's an exhibition of short films at the university and the organizer called me. He told me they're putting the short film we worked on into the lineup. Wow, congrats... Congrats to us, we both worked on it. Nah, just you. Written and directed by Jason Inigo Gatchalian. Let's go to the opening together? Sure. It would be really special for me, especially since... we're still together. Pamilabs... Thank you for giving me a second chance. And I'm so happy that we're still together. Pamilabs? Will you marry me? Say "yes"! Say "yes"! Say yes, Pam! Say yes, Pam! - Pam! - Congratulations! Look at the stars up there. There seem to be more of them, and they shine brighter here than in Manila. They're the same size and number as when we're in Manila. So they're like people too? Huh? The Pam before is no different than the Pam beside me now. Your ex-boyfriend and I were looking at the same woman. But Jiggs is seeing someone different. Take care. Thanks. Drive! Boss Isko! Tin said Pam's about to get married. I don't care about it, Caloy. Let's just all move on, okay? You sure about that? Why can't you seem to stop hacking at those poor coconuts? I don't see any customers. I'm going to make coconut salad as my gift to Pam for her wedding. Happy now? Sheesh! You're hurt? You're still affected boss, admit it. You love her? Actually, why am I lashing out at these coconuts when I can chop you up instead?! Does it really hurt, boss? Tell me how much it hurts. Do you really want me to hurt you?! Get the hell out of my face! I think it's real. It's shiny. I think it's a real diamond too. Because it's so small. I'd be more concerned if it were any bigger. Then it would be fake. Who's doing your gown? I'm meeting with a designer. Yeah. Tin? Will you come with me? Sure. And speaking of meeting, I ran into Caloy earlier. Really? How is Isko? Isko? Caloy didn't say anything about Isko. Why, should I have asked? Sis. Hey! - Are you okay? - Yeah, go on, just eat. Okay, thank you. You should try it. Yeah, it's pretty good. Isko? Sir, can you wait here? Isko. Sorry. Wow. How long has it been since they screened my short film here, again? Six? Seven years? Six-seven years ago. That's how long it's been. We were here in CCP too, six-seven years ago. We watched that short film along with our friends. You remember? You helped me make that short film. You bought all the props. I almost lost you... But... I'm glad that didn't happen. You're still here by my side. Yeah. We've been... Through a lot. Fought for a lot. And because of that, we're still together. In a few months, we're going to be married. Yeah, we're getting married. Does that make you happy? Do I still make you happy? I should be happy... Because this was my dream. And this is what I wanted. You know? But when you asked me to get married... Now that we're almost there... I don't feel happy. Pam, what's the matter? Jiggs... I'm happy... To make you happy. But did you ever stop to wonder if I was happy? Pam... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being selfish. Don't worry about that anymore. I guess as the years have passed... So much has changed. We're different people now. We have different desires too. Pam, you're the one that I desire. Jiggs... No. Maybe you've just got used to always having me around because we're comfortable being around each other. But if there's nothing there... Then let's not force it. There's no love anymore. Maybe friendship. So... You're breaking up with me? No. I'm setting you free. I'm setting us free. Looks like you really need someone hot and good-looking, no? Sis, that's heavy! Let me carry that. Thank you for being one of our regional distributors. Thank you, let's take some pictures. Let me see, do a quick turn. Fuck. My god, you have a thing for me, huh? - Don't flatter yourself. - Is it really that cold? Yeah, check it out! Hey! Yeah it's cold! I get it, it's cold! But Pam, no one's stopping you. You can do whatever you want. - Kiss my armpits. How's that for sweet? - Ass-hat! Ass-hat! You're seriously making me pedal on my own? There you go. It's something like this! It's pretty! - I love you, Baguio! - Thank you. - Solid. - Thank you. In your face, Jiggs! Yes, ma'am. We're open for distribution in Bicol. Let's set up a meeting. I'll schedule it. Thank you. What's that? Girls... Girls! What?! Look at this. Isn't this the owner of Isko Buko? Let me see. What are you talking about? Is this really Isko? Oh my god! He looks good! And he doesn't just own one branch of Isko Buko. He owns 20 branches all over Metro Manila. Not to mention, he does have a big dick, right? Really? I want to see. Oh wow, this is him. How did he become this successful? Why don't you pay him a visit and find out? Just go for it. One, or two? Oh, thank you. Is that all, ma'am? Okay, thank you! Miss. What can I get you? No... Actually, I'm looking for the owner? Oh sorry, we don't accept solicitations. Do I look like someone who's doing that? But you're not buying anything, you're just standing there. So what are you doing? If you're here to scam us, I'm sorry but I'm not falling for any tricks. Nope. Did you get that attitude from your boss? Mario, are you being rude again? Didn't I tell you the customer is always right? Pam? Hi. I knew it! You own the "Isko Buko" franchise. How did you build it into this? I found a sugar mommy. She supported me and gave me money for capital. Jerk. No seriously, where did the money come from? I won the lottery. 42 million. Are you for real? Really, how? I met a mysterious old man. He gave me a money-generating amulet. You're pissing me off, Isko. - "You're pissing me off, Isko"? Seriously? - What? I'm serious. I met a rich old man who I told my life story to. My problems and all that. And he gave me the money for capital. Good things do come to good people. In life, we just have to have faith to be successful. Besides, I haven't forgotten what you said to me. "To be a businessman, you have to have..." "STD". What are you doing here? So you remembered that? No, I was just hoping I could see you and talk to you. But you know where I live, right? You could have visited me and talked to me there. Well, you have my number so why didn't you call me or even send me a text? Well, your husband might get upset. I didn't follow through with marrying Jiggs. What? But you loved him so much. You even paid me to make him jealous. Well... I realized that in a relationship... Both of you have to be happy. Both of you have to love each other. And you both have to inhabit the same world. I don't want to adjust anymore to fit into his. Besides, there's a whole new world I want to be in. Well, that's mostly on you. You were forcing someone who can't love you the way you love him. - You were stupid. - So, I was stupid? He said I was stupid. Your boss hasn't changed a bit. You're still irksome and blunt. But... But even if you are like that... Even if you look like a jerk and a son-of-a-bitch... You're actually pretty loving. Caring. That's why... Francisco Mangahas... Can I be... A part of your world? I'll think about it. Okay, I guess that would work. - You accept me for who I am? - Of course! You have a big... Coconut business. And a big heart. But what about me? Is it okay that I'm just an online seller? Of course, you're rich. No, I'm kidding. Of course you're welcome to my world. In our world... You are the bu-ko. Buko? Buhay ko. (My everything). Fuck. Shit. We learned something today. One more, come on. In my life... My cock is all yours. Okay, okay, hug me! So, are we together? - So are we together now? - That's up to you. Fine. - Me too! - One more. One, two, three. Chase me! Oh, there's the waves! One more. Run after me. Is this the finale? We should dance! Let's dance! One! Two! Three! Buko, buko, ni Isko! Yes! Buko, buko, ni Isko! Finale! Finale! We have to dance! Buko! Buko, buko, ni Isko!
