That nothing you ever expect to happen ever does? My name's Alice, and welcome to my world. Hey. Come on, Al. We need a hand. Thinking about your mom? I feel like we're leaving her here.. No, it's just the memories that are here. You know, wherever we go, she'll be with us. Do we really have to move? It's gonna be great. Before you know it, Silver Spring will seem like your home. Oh, and did I mention there's a great pizza place about 5 minutes away? Great reason, Dad. Got to give me credit for trying. Come on. We got to go. Up. Lester. Bye. See ya. See ya. Here's my girl. There's enough in here for everybody. Okay? Thanks. I got that. Thank you, honey. I wish you the best. All right. Bye. Bye, sweetheart. I love you so much. Take care. Take care of yourself. Floss those teeth. Here's my lovely. Oh, I'm so proud of you. Listen, I want you to call me if you need anything at all, honey. In fact, I want you to call me from the road. Does your daddy have a phone? We got it. Don't take your shoes off. You never know what's on the floor of these things. Okay? Bye, bye. [Alice] Bye, Aunt Sally.

I'm Sheila Price, and this is my daughter, Elizabeth. Hi! I'm Alice! You look so... beautiful. These clothes? I just threw these rags on this morning. I'm Alice. Hi. Ugh. [Mrs. Pierce] We figured you might not have time to eat, so we brought over dinner-- it's homemade meat loaf. Meat loaf. Thanks. We're actually going out for pizza tonight. Uh, n-no problem. You should keep it, though. Leftovers come in handy. But it's still hot. I'm sure someone would take it. Oh, of course. We'll eat it. Thank you very much. I'm Ben McKinley. Sheila Price. We really appreciate this. Looks good. Just let us know if you need anything. Hey, maybe we can get the girls together sometime. That would be wonderful. Bye. It's not like I try to do embarrassing things. They just... happen to me. How do I learn to avoid 'em? All I have are Dad and Lester to teach me. [belching] [belching] You see my problem? Mom died when I was 5, so I pretty much have to figure out things on my own. I just never seem to get 'em right. Mmm, not bad. You should ask her out. She's married. Could be divorced. Never date your neighbor, okay? If if doesn't work out, she lives right next door. What's the worst that could happen? Besides, it's not like you're, you know, getting any younger. I'm 42. Yeah, that's halfway to the grave. Lester! Got to face the facts, Al. Dad's days are numbered. Might as well try to have a little happiness while he still can. Lester, do you really expect me to take dating advice from someone that shaved their head to get a girl who broke up with him a week later? Hey, I like it, okay? Plus, I'm just trying to help. Okay, you want to help? Take your sister to the mall tomorrow, get some school clothes. Yes! ♪♪ Who's the new girl? I don't know, but I hope she's in my class. Nice outfit. You look so cool. You want to come to my house after school? I don't understand why we can't get your school clothes at Kmart like we always do. Because some of us have a sense of fashion. Okay, these are the smallest ones they have. These don't fit. No kidding. I don't know. Your body must just be weird or something. You're not helping, Lester! This is the boys' section. She should be shopping in the girls' department. How was I supposed to know? Come on. Hey, what do boys know about clothes anyway? Nothing. I can hear you. Oh, my gosh! Al, still alive? I'm not coming out. Not ever. He's gone. I can still hear him breathing. [chuckles] That's just your imagination. Come on. Could've been worse. Could've been you standing there in your underpants. Look, I'm sorry I got dirt on your hand and didn't want your mom's meat loaf, but I don't know anyone else at this school, and I wish you'd just talk because I'm really scared. Me too. You are? Well, then we'll get through this together, all right? All right. All 6th graders into the auditorium. The door's to your left. All 6th graders, the door's to your left. This is where we get assigned our homeroom teachers. They teach us everything but math and science. That's Miss Cole. She's supposed to be really nice. And that's Mr. Weber. He's cool too. And that is Mrs. Plotkin. Everyone says she's mean. That is so funny. I have to be in Miss Cole's class. I mean, look at her. She's beautiful and smart and confident. She even dresses the way I wish I could. There's no way I would be such a loser if I could just learn from her. Okay, everybody, please listen. Each teacher will read a list of students. When you hear your name, please line up in front of your teacher. I'll begin. Gary Anderson, David Bower, Stephanie Brooks, Joshua Gluckman, Gillian Lambert, Patrick Loughton, Alice McKinley, Judy MacInerney, Amy Roger, Brendan Scott, Brianna Trenton, Julia Turner, Michelle Winston, Charlie Williams, Hey. and Leslie Woods. Don't I know you? I don't think so. I'm new. What-- You're that girl from the store. Oh, my gosh! [books thud] His name's Patrick, and he doesn't care at all that I've seen him in his underwear. What am I supposed to say now? "Were those Fruit of the Looms?" [shudders] Guys are weird. Good morning. I'm Mrs. Plotkin, and as you all know by now, I'm considered the toughest 6th grade teacher. Well, it's true. I believe in challenging my students. You may not like it now, but in 10 years you'll probably thank me. Alice. Is that correct? I think I'm in the wrong class. Wrong class? No, can't be. You're on my class list. Okay, so-- No, I'm supposed to be in Miss Cole's class. My dad called weeks ago. I'm certain the list is wrong. The names are generated through a computer and chosen randomly, Alice. Perhaps your father misunderstood. No, I'm really supposed to be in Miss Cole's room. That's what he told me. Perhaps you'd like to take it up with Mr. Edgecombe, the principal. Yes. Come on up here. Get your hall pass. Come on. He's right down the hall. Go, quick. Go, go. His office is right down the hall that way. What can I do for you? I know names are chosen randomly, but my dad said he really wanted me to be in Miss Cole's class, 'cause he said that she's cool and confident, and he said that she's the most amazing person ever, so he really wanted me to be in her class. Your dad said that, right? Okay, when was this? Last week, um... because we just moved here. Well, if you are new to our school, you wouldn't know very much about any of our teachers, now, would you? We found it's best not to play musical chairs with our classrooms. And I like to believe that all 3 of our 6th grade teachers are excellent, Alice. Now... I'm sure that if you put forth the effort, you'll find that you and Mrs. Plotkin will get along just fine. All right? [Miss Cole] Okay. Joke of the day. What did baby corn say to mommy corn? I don't know. What? "Where's popcorn?" [all laughing] I know what I just did was wrong, and I should never lie, but when I look at Miss Cole, I can't help myself. That's awesome. Okay, Hailey, your turn. So, how was the first day? Killer. Guys are cool, girls are hot, and I'm already talking about starting a band. Right on. How about you, Alice? Well, I got elected class president after being there for 5 minutes. Wow. Congratulations. I'm kidding, Dad. I have no friends, and I got the worst teacher in the whole school. I just want to go home. I thought you wanted pizza. No, our real home. Okay. This is our home now. I explained to you guys how important it is for me to own that music store, okay? It was the first day. I'm sure it'll get better. I don't know anyone. I feel like a freak. Making friends is the hard part, but I'm sure that you will, and soon. I'm not like Lester. He already has a band and a bunch of groupies. Yeah, but when he was your age, he was very shy. Mom and I, we decided he was so immature, we'd keep him back a year. You said I got the chicken pox and fell behind in school. Well, now you're old enough to know the truth. Thanks, Dad. You just made my day. That's funny. Feel better now? A little. But Mrs. Plotkin still stinks. Oh, look. Hey, Pamela, this is Alice. Patrick is telling all the guys at school to watch out for you. No, that was just a mistake, that's all. Okay, I maybe saw his underwear. [chuckles] That's great. Wait until I tell everyone. Hey, listen to what the new girl has to say about Patrick... No, I didn't mean for you-- [gasps] [laughing, chattering] Yeah. Things are really looking up. [Mrs. Plotkin] I always like to end the day by reading a book to my class. Every year we start with my favorite novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. There's got to be another way that I can get in Miss Cole's class. "'Tom? Tom? "'What's gone with that boy, I wonder. Tom?'" "The old lady pulled her spectacles down "and looked over them around the room. "Then she put them up and looked under them. [snoring] "She seldom or never looked through them "for so small a thing as a boy. "They were her state pair, the pride of her heart, [snoring loudly] and were built for style, not service." Alice! [children chuckling] [bell rings] Okay, kids, don't forget to read the first chapter in your American history book for tomorrow. Alice, I'd like to speak with you. Sit, please. You know, it's apparent you don't want to be in this class. And quite frankly, with the behavior you're carrying on, I don't particularly want you in my class. Sorry. I'm going to have to schedule a meeting with your parents. No. You leave me no choice. My dad just opened a new store. He's really busy. Well, then, your mother's gonna have to come by herself then if he can't make it. My mother's...dead. Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Mrs. Plotkin, I'm sorry for the way I acted, and I'll never do it again. Just please, don't make me tell my dad. I don't usually do this, but I'm gonna give you another chance. But don't make me regret it. I won't. Oh, Alice? Here's something I thought you might like. The theatre club is putting on a musical this season, and the teacher in charge is Miss Cole. Really? Really. First meeting's this Thursday afternoon. Thanks. Hey, Al. How you doing? What do you think of the store? Cool. Hey, can I join theatre club? It meets at school 2 days a week. Sure. Yeah. You'll probably make some new friends that way. Okay. Can you just sign here? Yeah. I already filled it out. Hey, can I look at the gift shop for a minute? Yeah. Loretta, this is my daughter, Alice. Could you help her out? Sure, Mr. McKinley. So, you're Lester's sister. You know Lester? I have biology with him. He's pretty hot. That's completely wrong. I mean, Lester? Ew! [exhales] ♪♪ [loud rock] What is that? ♪ Jenny got a fever ♪ ♪ Jenny got a fever ♪ What's going on? ♪ Jenny got a fever ♪ ♪ Jenny got a fever ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ Whoo! Yeah! Lester, what are you doing? Oh, what's up, Al? Hey, meet the guys. This is Matt on the drums, Caleb on the "key-tar," we got Pete on bass, and this is Joe. We're the Naked Nomads. "The Naked Nomads"? Well, it was kind of hot down here, so we decided to take our shirts off. And we don't have any place to play, so we're really like nomads. "Naked Nomads." What do you think? I think it's great you found friends as strange as you. Hey, don't you have a dressing room to barge into? Well, at least I wasn't held back 'cause I'm a social loser. [guys chuckling] Hey, out. Now. All right, guys, let's play. Two, three, four! Oh, no, you look so cute. I'm serious. I don't look good at all. Hey, Alice. I didn't know you wanted to be in the theatre club. Oh, sure, I wouldn't miss it. Oh, did you act in your other school? Well, no, but there's always a first time. I've been taking voice lessons all summer so I'll be ready for the auditions. Hi, Patrick. There's a seat right here next to me. Hey, Pamela. Hey, Elizabeth. You know Alice, don't you? I'm not speaking to him. Why not? "Why not"? Because I don't talk to people who spread vicious rumors around the entire school and tell them I'm a peeping tom, when it's perfectly obvious that the whole thing was a complete accident. That's...why not. Well, then, who told the whole school what kind of underwear I have? That wasn't me! I think you're both being silly. Wow, we certainly have a good-sized group for the theatre club this year. As most of you know we will be putting together a school musical this year-- "The Princess and the Frog." And we've even managed to rent a local theatre for the performance, so this will really be a special production. Here. Pass this around. There will be 2 lead roles, the Princess and the Frog Prince, and I'll be working with them on an individual basis for extra rehearsals to work on the musical numbers. So the auditions are next Wednesday, and I'll see you all then. So break a leg. Yea! I'm going to have a whole dance choreographed for the song. Are you coming, Alice? In a minute. Hi. Miss Cole? Oh, hi. Um, my name's Alice. Alice McKinley. I just wanted to let you know how excited I am to be in theatre club. I'm gonna try out for the Princess role. Well, that's great. I wish you the best of luck. Oh, um, I'd also like for you to have this. Oh. It's from my dad's store. It's for your hair. It's lovely. Thank you. It's in the shape of musical notes 'cause of the theme of the musical and everything. Of course, of course. That's great. Are you trying to bribe me, Alice? No, no, I promise. [chuckles] I'm only kidding. Whose class are you in this year? Mrs. Plotkin. Oh. Well, that's...nice. Yeah. Well, hey, you're gonna have some fun in our club this year, right? Yeah. Well, thank you very much for the present, Alice. I'll see you next week? Good. ♪♪ [doorbell chimes] Thank you, Alice. Whatever would I do without you? Probably just be a loser, Dad. Hmm. Alice! Is this your dad? He is so handsome! Not as beautiful as you, Miss Cole. Well, it's all due to the wonderful barrette that Alice gave me. Hmm. Hmm. You're doing what? I'm auditioning for the school musical, "The Princess and the Frog." [scoffs] As what, the lily pad? Lester. No, the Princess. Well, you know, Al, if you don't get the lead role, it's not the end of the world. But I want to play the lead. I mean, look at our family. You play all sorts of instruments, Lester plays... whatever Lester plays, and didn't you say that Mom's a really good singer? Yes, but-- So it's in my genes. Something I can't even mess up. I'll be a natural. Ben McKinley? Is that you? Kelly? I can't believe it. You remember me? What are you doing here? I live in Silver Spring now. I have a law practice in Tacoma Park. What are you doing here? I thought I'd be hearing your songs on the radio by now. No. No, actually, the band broke up a few years ago. But, um, I own this place. We bought it a couple weeks ago. Great place. Right. Oh, right, yeah. This is my son, Lester, and my daughter, Alice. Hi, nice to meet you. Well, you'll all have to come by sometime for dinner with your wife. My wife passed away a few years ago. Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that. Well, um, you and the kids will have to come by then for dinner. We can barbecue. That'd be great. Here's my card. Give me a call sometime so we can get together. Yeah, I'll, uh... I'll do that. Come on, I'll walk you out. Do you know your dad was the hottest guy at Lincoln High? Every girl in school wanted to date him. Hottest guy in school? Ew! Hey, Lester. Oh, hey, uh.... Loretta. Right, yeah. I knew that. I was wondering if you could help me move some boxes up from the storeroom. Of course. [chuckles] ♪♪ This is more than I can take. What are you doing here? Aunt Sally! [laughing] Hi. Well, I just thought I'd drive over and see how you all are doing. Yeah? From Chicago? Milt and I were in Virginia visiting his brother. What, I need an excuse now to come and see my family? How did you get in? The side door was open. Ben, that is very careless, honey. With children around? Yeah, what are you doing vacuuming? You don't have to do that. No offense, hon, but the place was in dire need. I'm not even gonna ask when the last time was that you vacuumed. We all have pretty busy lives. Oh, no, I know that, honey. I'm not blaming you. My goodness. I know what an impossible situation this is for you. Working a full-time job, trying to take care of two children without any help at all. Uh, I'm not a child. Aw. I know you don't think so, honey. Sally... Wait a minute. You didn't wear those jeans to school, did you, honey? What's wrong with these? What kind of impression are you gonna give your teachers if you dress like a homeless person? And Alice, hasn't anyone shown you how to use an iron? Sally... I appreciate what it is that you're trying to do for us, I really do, and I know it only comes from the goodness of your heart, but we are quite capable of taking care of ourselves. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to help, that's all. I know. And you can help us. Just, uh, leave that vacuum there and let's go to dinner. What do you say? Oh, well! All right. Sure. I don't know why Dad stopped her from vacuuming. I mean, there's a whole pile of laundry she could've done too. So, want to come over and make brownies? My mom can help us. I'd love to, but Mrs. Plotkin loaded us with tons of homework. Oh. I feel bad for you. Me too. Still coming to my party on Saturday? Of course. Wouldn't miss it. Hey, girls. Hey, Pamela. Want to come over and make brownies? Sorry, I can't. Mother and I are going shopping for an outfit for the auditions, and then she's taking me to my voice lesson. Wow. You really want the part, don't you? Well, I just want the best person to win. Me. No offense, girls. [off-key] ♪ There-- There's ♪ ♪ There's... ♪ ♪ There... ♪ What are you doing? Murdering a cat?

The last time we heard her sing was in the second grade. And she was awful. Well, that was 4 years ago. You know, and kids grow. When you were 10, you couldn't even hit a baseball.

I forgot to do it. I see. Wasn't I very clear when I gave this assignment that there would be absolutely no excuses tolerated for not doing the assignment? You did. And you still chose not to do it? I didn't mean to. I was busy. I was practicing for my audition, and then there was Elizabeth's birthday... Alice, you've left me no choice but for the next 2 Thursdays, you will come in here after class and focus and write the paper. But theatre club meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays! Then I guess you're going to have to miss a couple of meetings. I can't miss the rehearsals, especially if I'm gonna be the star. [students chuckling] Would you like to go visit Mr. Edgecombe? Do it. I dare you. Mrs. Plotkin, you must release my star immediately! We need her in rehearsals! Well, she can't because she has to serve her detention. [chuckling] No, no, Mrs. Plotkin. As the star of our show, we need Alice. It's much more important than your detention. I'm sorry, but you've been overruled. Let's go, girls. I'll get you yet, Alice McKinley. Just you wait, you little... So, Alice, would you like to go see the principal again? No, Mrs. Plotkin. Oh, Alice, I'm glad you're here. Listen, I need to give you some money to order dinner out tonight. I'm gonna be a little late. You're going out tonight? Yeah, just dinner with a friend. That woman? Kelly. Is it, like, a date? Kind of. Okay. I guess that's okay with me. You sure? Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can you sign this? What is it? It's a detention slip. Alice! It's Mrs. Plotkin. I was a little late for a report. That's all. I thought we agreed that this theatre club thing wasn't gonna interfere with your schoolwork. It didn't, Dad. I just forgot. I think you're gonna have to forget the theatre club until the schoolwork gets in order. Dad, tomorrow are the final auditions. I'll stay up all night and write this report. I'll write an extra hundred words. I promise. Just-- I'll never do it again. Please? 150 words. 125. Deal. Last time. Mm-hmm.

Well, you were pretty awful. No. Al, can I come in? I, uh-- I guess you're still upset about not getting the part, huh? Kids are saying I'm the worst singer ever. Okay. So maybe you're a little tone deaf. So what? Wait. You knew that I couldn't sing? Well, honestly, Alice, um, in the second grade, you had a little trouble carrying a tune. Why didn't you tell me that I stink? Because I thought that with a little practice, when you got older you'd be better. You've ruined my life! It's not as bad as it seems. I mean, in a few days, no one will remember. I'll remember for the rest of my life. I thought... You're supposed to help, Dad. It's bad enough that I don't have a mom.

There is no "right thing" with an 11-year-old girl. Oh, Alice, I wanted to speak to you. Since you've finished all your work, I figured you could skip detention today and go to play rehearsal, okay? Thanks, Mrs. Plotkin, but I'm only Frog #3. Oh, I know Miss Cole feels every part is very important. And I thought you were looking forward to performing in front of the whole school. I didn't really care about the part. I just... I wanted to be with... Miss Cole? Well, if so, why, you could do that. Really? Well, I'm sure she's bogged down with a lot of work doing this musical. Maybe you could help her after school like you did for me. You think so? It's worth a shot. Why don't you ask her? She's over there. Thanks. I think I'll do that. Hi, Miss Cole. Oh, hi, Alice. Hi. I was wondering if I could maybe help you decorate, or if you need any help with anything. Sure, sure. Yeah, I could use some help. Okay. [chattering] Hey. Hey. You and Dad okay? I guess. I think you should give him a chance. He's trying the best he can. What's up with him and that Kelly lady? I don't know. I think he likes her. Well, he wouldn't get married, would he? Who knows? But you'd better get used to the idea, Al, 'cause it could happen. If Dad was gonna marry someone, they'd have to be really, really special. Thanks. Hey, Marilyn. Sorry I forgot to tell you I'd be working today, but maybe we can get together later. That's okay. I'm here to see Lester. Hey, Lester. Hey, Marilyn. What are you doing here? I was just finishing some shopping down the street, and I thought I'd stop by to see if maybe you wanted to walk home together. [whispering] I'm really busy right now. Um, can I call you back, like, later? Why are you whispering? Oh, I don't want to bother the customers. Um, I got to go downstairs, but... Lester, why is Marilyn here? Uh-oh. I-I don't know. Are you seeing her? Kind of. What's that supposed to mean? Yeah, what is that supposed to mean? I didn't even know you guys were friends. Well, we are. Yeah, we are. And we're also friends with just about every girl in school. Who are all going to know what a slime ball you are. Is there something I can do? How about dropping dead? You want to go to the movies tonight? Sure. I get off at 6. I'll come by. Great. Guess there's a downside to making friends easily. Okay. I'm done, Miss Cole. That's excellent work, Alice. I just wish I could take you home and have you straighten up my apartment. Oh, I'd be happy to. I'm only kidding. Well, not about me being a slob. I'm a total mess. Why? You always look so neat. Mmm, it's all an illusion. You know us girls. We have our ways, right? Right. You know, Alice, I was just considering changing a part of the play, and I think you might be perfect for the part I need. Really? Yeah. You'll still be a frog, but I was considering giving one of the frogs a larger role. The Frog Prince's right-hand man-- or woman, in this case. It won't be much of a change from what you're doing now, but you'll have a great moment in the first act. A small dance number. Would you be up for it? Definitely. Great. Well, then, I'll see you at rehearsal later in the week. I'm really looking forward to this. Me too. [chuckles] See you then. Okay, it may not be the Princess role, but it's almost as good. My own dance solo? Just 'cause I can't sing doesn't mean I can't be a star. 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4. Down, down, down. Head, head. Jump, jump. Okay, you try it. Okay. [bell rings] Jump, jump. That's great. You're really taking to this dance. Well, it's a fun part. Well, you're perfect for it. Um, I could help you carry all this back to your room and put it away. Ah, that would be great, Alice. Thanks so much for offering. Miss Cole? I'll bet you like musicals, don't you? Of course I do. That's why I like trying to find new and unusual ones for you kids to perform. Well, did you know my dad owns a music store? Oh. And he carries all types of sheet music for all types of musicals. Oh, I'll have to stop by sometime. Great. Well, here's the address, and I usually help him on Saturdays. Maybe I'll stop by this weekend. Sometimes I'm so brilliant it's scary. I can help too, Miss Cole. Wow, I have my choice of helpers today. Thank you, Pamela. You don't have to stay, Pamela. I'm sure you're really busy with all the extra rehearsals. Oh, it's not a problem. I like helping Miss Cole. Thanks so much for your help, girls. I could help wash the boards, if you want. Hmm. Well, I suppose they could use a washing. I'll take you up on your offer, Alice. The supply shelves are looking a little messy. I could straighten them out. Well, if you really want to, Pamela, but it's not necessary. You've already done enough already. It's okay. I'd love to help. I bet you do. I'm so glad Pamela offered to help this afternoon. Now I have time to go shopping with you, Alice. I'll just text the girls to meet us at the mall. ♪♪ ♪ I'll be looking till I finally get there ♪ ♪ Nothing's standing in my way this time, I swear ♪ ♪ Till then you'll find me having some fun ♪ [screams] Really, girls, if you just want to head home. We're very enthusiastic about our cleaning. Oh. Al, what are you still doing here? I told you you could go home about an hour ago. The music was out of order, so I'm just alphabetizing it. Oh. Well, you'd better get going soon. It's getting dark out there. Well, I thought I'd wait for you. No, honey, I have plans tonight, remember? We talked about it. With Kelly? Yeah, we, uh... we kind of have a date. You don't...love her, do you, Dad? [door bell chimes] You know, it's, um... It's not like in the movies, Al. You don't fall in love with somebody overnight. It usually takes a while. If my dating is a problem for you, though, we can talk about it. No, I want you to date again. I just want you to find the right woman, that's all. So do I. Miss Cole! Miss Cole! Alice! Yes! Well, I made it. Yes, yes. Miss Cole, this is Ben, my dad. Hi. He owns this whole music store. He's actually into all types of music. He was in a band once. He was the hottest guy. He's actually dating again too. It's been 6 years since my mom passed away, so you don't have to worry about that either. Alice? I think that's a little more information than Miss Cole was looking for. Miss Cole is interested in everybody. She's very social. Right, Miss Cole? I guess. So, was there anything in particular that you were looking for? No, I just thought I'd browse through your sheet music. Great. If you need anything, just let me know. In the meantime, I'd like a word with Alice. Of course. I should be getting home soon anyway. I know you mean well, Alice, and you're trying to help, but I think it's best if I pick my own dates. Dad, she's perfect. She likes music, she's smart, she's beautiful. She's 15 years younger than me. Age is just a state of mind, Dad. You're young at heart, right? Can you please just talk to her? I'm sure you'd like her a lot more than Kelly. She's hot. Al, I am not going out with Miss Cole. [knock at door] [Kelly] Ben? Hi. Hi. Am I interrupting? Uh, no. No, I think, um, we're good here. If he thinks I'm just giving up like that, he's crazy. Thanks for the ride. The mechanic said my car would be fixed yesterday, so it'll probably be sometime next week. [chuckles] My pleasure. Besides, I had to find some way to thank you for that great dinner. That feels...very good. I can't. What's wrong? [Ben] I...I like you. I mean, I really do. It's just, um... my life's kind of complicated right now. Ben, Marie has been gone for 6 years. I know. It's time to move on. It's just, uh, I just moved here and I bought this store, and my kids, especially Alice, she has a lot going on right now. What about yourself? I'm not sure. I'm not trying to rush you into anything. No, you're great. It's just, um, like I said, it's complicated. I'm not giving up on you. Just know that. Dad, what's with the dead bird? It's Thanksgiving. Again I ask, what's with the dead bird? We always go out. Oh, no. Not this year. Not with Sally and Milt coming. No, we're gonna have a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with a traditional Thanksgiving turkey. And traditional food poisoning? Elizabeth told me if the turkey's not properly cooked, the bacteria could kill us. Hear that, Dad? I'm too young to die. Me too. Okay, if you're not gonna help me cook, then you go upstairs and clean it up. I need it in decent shape by the time they get here. Smiley girl, you go do the laundry. Yes, you. Okay, it's just me and you now. [groans] [groans] Hello. Ooh! [disposal whirrs] Ugh! [retches] [grunting] Ow! Ah! Hot! [clattering] No. No, no. [footsteps approaching] Laundry's done. Need anything else? Uh, yeah. You know that big serving platter that we have? I think it's probably in one of those boxes we haven't unpacked downstairs. You've got to be kidding me. Ah, there you are. [Ben] Alice! Did you find the platter? Uh, I got it! My teacher just gave me an "A" for the last English report I did. She said I had a talent for writing. I'm also in the school musical. It's a small part, but I have my own dance number, so it's really important to the story. Oh, honey, that is very good! Alice, put your napkin on your lap, hon. Ben, put your napkin on your lap. Lester, you too, hon. And what about you, honey? How are your grades? Pretty good. I'm only failing 3 of my classes. Lester, stop it. He's doing fine, Sally. Well, I hope so. Junior year is the most important one for colleges. I'm not going to college. I'm going on tour with my band. Or joining the Merchant Marines. What did I say? She knows I'm kidding. Don't you, Aunt Sally? Well, of course I do. But you are going to college, aren't you? It's his decision, not ours. But do you think that's wise? I think that, uh, everyone should get to decide for himself or herself what their future should be. But he hasn't even turned 18 yet. I don't think Marie would want that. I think I know better than you what Marie would want; I am his father. And if you can't respect that, I don't think I can welcome you in this house. Well...I do know that. And I respect that, Ben. And...I'm sorry. I worry about them sometimes, but just because I love them so much. I know. Um, I'm sorry I raised my voice, Sally. It's just, we've been under a lot of pressure lately, and, um, I know how much you love them, and I can use all the help I can get. Well, thank you. So what do you say we talk about something else? Milton, how you been? Great. My Merchant Marine application came through without a hitch. What? [giggling] I got the tickets! [Ben] Marie, move closer to the play poster. I want to make sure we remember what we were seeing when we're 90. I think we'll be lucky enough to remember each other's names, forget about a musical we saw 70 years ago.

Oh, I feel like such a tourist! Oh, all right. Dad! What are you doing up? Dad... [Ben] You're so gorgeous. I love you. I was just watching... Those are not to be watched. But they're videos of Mom. Why didn't you tell me we had those? Maybe when you're older. I'm old enough now! I want to see Mom! I don't want to talk about it, Alice. Go to bed. You never want to talk about it. Please just go upstairs. You're not the only one who lost Mom. Hey, what's wrong? Dad got mad at me for watching the videotapes of Mom. Did you know we had those? Yeah. We used to watch them all the time when you were a baby. Dad really hasn't been able to watch them, though, since... Don't you want to see them? Yeah, but not if it hurts Dad. When it comes to Dad, I can't seem to do anything right. It's okay, Al. We're all trying to do the best we can. ♪♪ [singing scales] Hey, Alice, why did the frog jump off the 10-story building?

You've ruined the play! But I didn't mean to. Okay, look. I don't want to hear any excuses. We'll finish this play as best we can, okay? Do you think you can do that, Pamela? Yeah. Good. Now, go back out on that stage and finish this scene, okay? I think you're finished for tonight, Alice. You can wait back here or go home. ♪♪ It was an accident, Alice. There was no way you could've stopped it. Miss Cole and Pamela think I did it on purpose. That is ridiculous, and Pamela and Miss Cole will realize that once they've calmed down. Where's your family? They're still inside. I can't believe I just ruined the whole play! Now you're just talking silly, you know that? They've already got the castle rebuilt, and you could hardly even see the little tear in Pamela's dress. It's a little mistake. One mistake. That's all. Nothing. Mrs. Plotkin, I can't do anything right. You know every kid your age feels the exact same way? It doesn't seem like it. Well, that's 'cause they're busy hiding it. Just like you're hiding now. Well, I can't hide anymore. You know, I bet in a few months this'll all fade away, and when you're older you're gonna get a good laugh at this memory. I can't imagine ever laughing about this. That's 'cause you weren't watching it. It's not funny. No, I know. I know. A frog knocking down a castle-- splat. No, it wasn't funny at all. [stifled chuckle] The tree could've fallen on Pamela. And what is more tragic than a squished princess? Well, you made it for me. Would you do me a favor and autograph my program? Personalize it. So Mrs. Plotkin was right. The scenery went back up, Pamela's dress was fixed, and the show went on. Pamela even got a standing ovation. Today's the theatre club party, and I'm not sure I should even be going. And I'm getting a new puppy out of it. Really? Yeah, my parents said... Hi, Alice. Hi, Patrick. This party's for cast and crew only. You left the play early. Leave her alone, Pamela. Yeah, cut her some slack. She didn't mean to do it. Well, how can you be so sure? Alice wouldn't do something like that. Patrick, why are you defending her? 'Cause... she's cool. Really, Pamela, I never meant for any of that to happen. I might have been a little jealous that you got the part-- okay, really jealous-- but I would never ruin the whole play on purpose. I suppose it would be difficult to mess up that badly on purpose. I mean, who would want to humiliate themselves like that in front of all those people? Thanks. I think. Alice, I owe you an apology. I overreacted last night and jumped to conclusions. I'm sorry. I hope you'll stay for the party. And then afterwards maybe you can help me clean up a bit? I'll give you a ride home if it's too late to walk. I'd love to stay and help, but I actually have to go meet someone. Isn't it funny how I've been trying to be friends with Miss Cole just so she could be my role model when my real role model was standing right before me? Hi, Mrs. Plotkin. Oh, hi, Alice. Theatre club was having a party, so I thought I'd bring you some cake. That is so sweet of you. You know, I was just thinking about taking a little break myself. Have a seat. I just want to thank you for helping me the other night. It really made me feel better. Oh, it's my pleasure. I was wondering if I could come back and help you clean the room in the afternoons. Oh, that isn't necessary, hon. No, I'd like to, really. I'm trying to say it won't be necessary because... I'm not returning to school after winter break. Well, when are you coming back? September, at the earliest. I've decided to take a sabbatical. You know I've been working here over 25 years? I decided I'd like to spend a little more time at home. You can't just leave in the middle of the year. Well, I know it's not great timing, Alice, but that's the way things work out sometimes. But I have been thinking that if you would still like to be in Miss Cole's class, that I could maybe get Mr. Edgecombe to agree to transfer you there. Due to the circumstances and all. I don't want to be transferred, and I think what you're doing is awful! Alice... Alice, come back! Alice, stop. Please? I know you're upset, and I understand that. But please let me explain the real reason why I'm leaving, okay? You're not going on sabbatical? Well, yes, I am, but not because I want to. My doctor has recommended it. Your doctor? You see, Alice, I have a problem with my heart. One of my valves isn't right. So they have to do an operation to fix it. Are you gonna be all right? Well, I certainly hope so. I mean, they'll do the surgery and treatment and all sorts of therapy that'll make me weak and tired, but in a few months, the doctor says I should be fine. I'm really sorry. Me too. But thank you. [knocking] Al? Go away. Mrs. Plotkin called. She's worried about you. She told me what happened. I'm sorry. Well, I'm not. Not anymore. Don't say that. Why not? I may not see her again. Why should I care? You don't mean that. Once someone's gone, they're gone. What good does it do to think about them? It doesn't make them any better. It only makes you feel sad. Alice, stop. Isn't that why you never want to watch the videotapes of Mom? Isn't that why you want to date Kelly? 'Cause you never want to think about Mom! I think about your mother every moment of my life. Alice... there isn't an hour that goes by that I don't wonder, "What would she do? What would she think?" I love her more than anything in the world, except maybe you and Lester. How come we never talk about her? How come I haven't seen the tapes? It was wrong of me to keep that stuff from you guys. I just... I wanted us to grow as a family, not be stuck in the past. I think about her all the time, even though I can't remember her. I know you do. You probably will your whole life. I know I will. Just because she isn't here, it doesn't mean that she's not with us. She is with us. That's what makes us strong. What about Mrs. Plotkin? The thing about Mrs. Plotkin-- she's still alive. And, yeah, she's gonna be gone for a while, but she'll come back. When she does, you can call her, write her nice letters-- I know she'd like that. I think I'll do that. Dad, I love you. I love you too. And I think Kelly's pretty cool. It'd be okay with me if you wanted to see her again. As much as I like Kelly, I feel like I got a lot on my plate right now. But thank you. [Mrs. Plotkin] Alice, come on in. Look at your house! With all this leisure time on my hands, I don't know what I'm gonna do once I go back to the classroom. So you're coming back? Absolutely. The doctor said that surgery went well, and he feels that in maybe... by next September I'll be back in the classroom. Wow! That's great! Yeah. Oh, I have a little something for you. Thanks. Tom Sawyer. This is the book that you read to us in the classroom. It is. You know that was my book from grade school? It's the first book I read that I truly loved. And, um, with all the trouble Tom got into, I thought it sort of reminded me of you. [scoffs] Well, I couldn't imagine why. How many marshmallows? 3, please.
