Ladies and gentleman, to my mind, there has never been a finer work on the history of the supernatural. - It suits you, success. - You're making me blush. - Just you wait. Nearly a decade of exhaustive work has gone into this book, which I think does not set about disproving myths, so much as showing their importance as fictions. It's a wonderful thought-provoking book, and it's our privilege to publish it. A few words, Daniel? - Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Hi. Was I cool? I was pretty cool, right? - Yeah, you were pretty cool. For a geek. - I won't keep you too long, but I would like to say a few words of thanks. First and foremost, it has to be my wife, Maria. Without her support, I'd be a much worse writer and a much worse person. On a professional note, huge thanks must go to a man named Sean McMahon. His contribution to the book has been immeasurable. I can't tell you the number of late nights I've spent on the phone or internet pestering the man about some pretty grim subjects, but he'd always point me in the right direction. He's become a friend as well as mentor, and I hope he writes in the field himself someday. - I'm sure Mr. McMahon is very pleased. - Perhaps this is where he demands some of the book sales. Not that I think it'll add much to our income. - Aw. Who needs income when you've got love? â™ª Who's got the love - And finally, thanks to Whittles Publishing for releasing the damn thing. - Hey there. - Yeah. Aww, that spoiled the music. - Drink? - Definitely. No one's home. Keep going. - Congratulations, baby. - Thank you. - Well what's next? People kept banging on tonight about the pitter patter of tiny feet. - Let's do it. Let's get a dog. - First things first anyway. Tomorrow morning is next. - What's tomorrow morning? - Tomorrow morning is Sunday morning. And it's the rarest of Sunday mornings when neither of us, unless I'm mistaken, has any work to do. - Oh, I see. Well, that does sound nice. - Breakfast in bed. - If you're cooking. - I drove tonight. - I'm cooking. - Just you, me, and Sunday morning. - Hm. - But one must earn one's rest. Surprises if her head's still on her fuckin' shoulders after that. What's wrong? - Nothing, baby. Go back to sleep. - Dan? - Sh. Whoa! Maria, Maria! Go, go! No! Maria! Dan! - Daniel! Daniel! No! No! - No! - No, Maria! No! No! - No, Maria! No, no! Maria, no! Don't move! No! Morning! I brought some food for you. I noticed you had nothing in last time. - You said it a few times. Did you sleep all right? - Did you get a paper? I did. - Can I see it? Let's get you up first. - I can do it. Good stuff. You've eaten anything yet? - No, I'm fine. Can I see the paper please? I really rather you ate something first. - Fi, the paper, please. There's nothing in it. I've already checked. - Well, you might have missed something. If there was anything new, the police would have called. They're not going to find anything new. At least the papers are still interested. - It's becoming unhealthy. - Reading the paper? Just let it go to the message. Unless it's the police. Hello, this is Daniel and Maria's residence. Maria's dead so please don't- - Dan! Any messages. Daniel, I hope you'll call when you feel up to it. I'd like to know you're okay. - Who's that? - That's McMahon. I mean how you're getting on- - He still calls a lot. I think it will help you to talk about it. - You have not spoken to him since? I hope it's not just me you're avoiding, right? - You think he'd take a forthright hint. Do you want me to talk to him for you? Do the work, you know? - No, I owe the guy big time. And I need to speak to you about something. Please, lad, just call me as soon as you can. - I don't think he'd listen anyway. - It's a beautiful day. Blistering sun. - Sounds nasty. - Why don't I take you to the cliffs? You said you wanted to scatter the ashes. - I'll tell you what, you're done for the day. You can leave. Please just leave. The investigation into the shocking attack at the home of Maria and Daniel Shergold has been abandoned by police. The local police chief- - Hello? Frankly, I think if Mr. Shergold is- - You're not real. His wife would still be fucking drawing breath. - You bastards! You bastards! Daniel. Danny? Daniel? Answer, please. - Sean, hi. It's good to hear you. - Yeah. How are you? I'm glad you picked up. - I'm not working anymore, Sean. No, no. I don't think you would be. Listen- You're sorry, I know. So am I. I could tell just from talking to her, she was something real special. She was. How you getting on? Look, I appreciate your concern, but- They're animals you know. What they did to you, nothing but animals. - Well, they're not caged. The police got nowhere? - Three men in masks. That's all I could give them. No prints, no CSI magic, nothing. If you knew who they were, what would you do? - I would tear them apart. Listen, Danny, I can send a friend of mine to come and see you. - Who? Someone who can help you. If you want them to. Someone who can help you find them. - No one can do that. He can. I'll have him come and see you, and if you don't like what he has to offer, you can send him packing. - Can I help you? Is this a criminal someone, Sean? Not really. All you have to do is listen. What have you got to lose? Mr. Shergold? - Yes, and you are? I'm a friend of Sean's. - I think I need to know a little more. Infurnari. His name is Infurnari. - Would you like to come through? Call me after some time and let me know you got on. You take care now. - Sean- So how do you know McMahon? - He knows lots of people like me. People like what? - People you don't normally meet. - What exactly it is you do? - Mr. Shergold, you need to let me ask the questions. - Since you're in my house- - I heard it was your wife's house. - It's hers, so what? - And here you are rattling around in it. - Did you just come here to make fun of me? - No, I just needed to know the situation. So any children? Close relatives? Please, I will explain. - No relatives left. Most of this is inherited from Maria's side. Children ... Maybe someday. We both worked hard and any spare time we had, we wanted for each other. - Yes, I'm familiar with your writing. Your book is excellent by the way. Way off the mark, excellent. - You've read it? Yes. You're working on anything new? - No, I've seen real monsters now. Shit! - Real monsters? Why don't you tell me about real monsters? - If you can do what they did without empathy, without sympathy, they can only be afraid for themselves, you know? When you love something, you're afraid of losing it. Other human beings understand that, because they feel it too. These weren't human beings. - Let's show them what real fear is. How? I can show you how. - What can you do? Look at me! - I can give them to you. - That's impossible. - Would you want it if it weren't? - Look, if you can find them, if you can punish them, then do it. I'll pay every penny I have. - It's not so simple. Everything has a price, and I don't want your money. Think about all the things you might still do. Because if I go through with this, everything will change. Would you really give up the rest of your life to find these men? - Who are you? - I need an answer. - Yes. - And will you kill? Because I won't do it for you. - I can do that. - Then relax. This might take a while. - Oh thank fuck for that. You leave any later? - It's nice to see you too, Tom. - Alright Stevie, how's things? - Could we have done this at your place? - No, Lucy's there. - What? Does she know? - Of course she don't. How's that parrot getting on? What? - You fucking sap. This is serious. We need this. - I've already got a job, mate. - Didn't I pay so well? Not interrupting anything, am I? Roy, mate, these are lads Randall and my brother Stevie. - Steve. - All right, lads. One of you got the footage? Nice. There's the rest. Any problems with the police? - No. We've been keeping a low profile. Keeping a low profile? I should fucking hope so. The papers have barely shut up about it. I've only just plucked up enough balls to come anywhere near you lot. Choose your targets more carefully. Choose someone from the estates, like a wallet or something, and no one would give a shit. So there's more work? Yeah, if you want it. Same deal as before. Half now, half after. - Yeah, all right. - I've already got a buyer for this one. - How much? - Never you mind. Suffice to say, we may have found ourselves a nice little niche here. What you boys doing Saturday night? - I've got nothing planned. - Well maybe with some of my lads, if you want to join. - Yeah, all right. Oh and lads, smart yourselves up a bit. You look like a bunch of fucking chavs. We're in business, lads. Morning. Sorry, I'm a bit late. I left my bloody phone behind again so I had to turn around. I'll get some breakfast on right away, which is just as well because I'm famished. - Sorry about the mess in the kitchen. - What mess? - I dropped a glass in there last night. - Oh, you cleaned it up really well. Have you now? - Apparently. - You don't remember? - What's for breakfast? Very good. - How do I do that? - Any number of ways. She must be a kind woman. - She's a saint. You need to dismiss her now. - Why? - 'Cause she can't heat a pasta for one thing. You'll get by though. What did you do last night? - It's a secret for now I'm afraid. The most important thing is you don't let anyone know what is happening to you. What's happening to me? I have no idea what is happening right now. - Your carer is in a very precarious position. - Is that a threat? - No, it's a statement. - Are you fucking? - Would you like to? - I can't fuck anything, and I had a wife remember? You're supposed to be helping me. - I am helping you. Get rid of her. You're changing. You're leaving your old life behind. - So in the new life, will I talk in riddles too? - I can't go into detail right now. You really have to experience this for yourself, and I really have to let you. - I must be going mad. - Enjoy it. Hi, this is Sean. I can't pick up the phone right now. Leave a message. - Yeah, Sean, it's Dan. Just call me back whenever you can, all right? Cheers. - Please stop. - Dan? Dan? God, what are you doing here? - I saw Maria. - How did you get here? - Shut the curtains. The curtains? - It's the light. I need to get a doctor. - Not here. I don't want to be in here. Can you get me downstairs? I hate this room. I hate this room! Let me help you. - Basically get us out of this, Stevie. Randall, leave the bird alone. - Tell me about it. - Seven o'clock, we go. - What did the old king make of the last one? - He said the masks were a nice touch. - I bet he did. - Who's the king? - Ah, you've left little Stevie in the dark, Tom. - Some people call Roy the king of slum. He owns a lot of stuff in town. Strip clubs, porn shops. - Yeah, and half of the whores about. He's a right slum, the little shit. - He's a rich, slimy little shit. Let's see what we got here. Tell me about it. She'll kick him out soon, you know. He's a bastard. - Think about that. - All right, lad? - Yep. - Are we comfy, eh, Stevie? - Listen, mate, those won't give a shit about you. - Sh. - No, bollocks to Roy and the Estates. I say we stick to the ones who don't know their poor. - It's just business, Rand. - Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em all. Wrong place. Wrong time. - Yeah. - I'm calling a doctor. - No, Fi, don't. - You're sick. I don't know what's wrong with you. - I just didn't sleep last night. It's like she was here. I'm exhausted. If you're worried, you can stay here and check on me. If you'll think about a doctor, then it's better when I wake up, okay? Please? - Okay. But I'm keeping you to that. - Fi. - Danny. You're standing. - Yeah. I don't remember getting here. What are you doing? - A doctor needs to look at you, and the papers too. Do you want to be on the front cover? - I have been. - How do you feel? - Fine. Don't call anybody though. I don't know what is going on. - Are you mad? Dan, you're a medical marvel. No calls. You just got up and walked. I know you're scared, and I can't imagine what's going through your head. Honey. You've got to face the world some time. - What the hell has happened to you? You need to get out, and don't come back. - You need a doctor. - Get out. Hi, this is Sean. I can't pick up the phone right now. Leave a message. - Fi? Fi? Fi, what's wrong? - She's dead, Danny. - How? - You showed her too much. - You killed her? - You killed her. I broke her neck. - You did this? - Danny, she was going to bring people here. - She didn't do anything wrong. She's a good person. - She's prey. - No, no, no, no! She is not fucking prey. - They are all prey. - I'm calling the police. Listen to you, the police. Can't you feel how different everything is now, Daniel? You're not apart of that anymore. - I didn't want her dead. - Everything has a price. - No, no, no. No. I can't do it. - You're sick Daniel, and you need to feed. Raw meat will only keep you alive. You need human. You would waste this death. - How do I? - Just do it. Incredible, isn't it? - Will she turn? - It's not a disease, Daniel. You can't get it from a bite. - I can't do this. - You can. Embrace it. Stop resisting. Whatever it is that is going on inside of you, anger, joy, euphoria, it's different for everyone, but it's always powerful. Use it. - How? - My father was addicted to opium. - What? - After I began to turn, I discovered he used to visit the dens all over London. I could smell it on him. By then he had been dead 10 years. Your memory is changing. Can you not feel it? Use it, properly. - What do you care? If they're all just prey, then what the fuck does it matter to you if I find them? - It doesn't, but it's good practice. I care about you. We care about you. - I never want to see you again. - Fine. You're on your own. Though I suggest you get on with it. Unless you want another Fiona to tide you by. - You sure he's done, Steve? - Yeah. Did you get it all on camera? Fucking right I did. - All right, boys, this is Tommy. Welcome. - All right, mate. - Hi mate. - Sit right over. Fucking right, sucker, yeah. - Puffers? - I don't know. - Is that what he always says? Really? Hey. - Hiyah, now what can we do for you tonight? - I was wondering if you can help me find someone. - Are you a copper? - No, it's a personal matter. - Oh, we don't really get involved in personal matters. - Please. Just tell me if you know this guy. Actually, mate, it doesn't really matter who you are. I'd give him up for a kick in the teeth. - You know him? - Unfortunately. So does everyone around here. - What's his name? - I couldn't tell you. People don't tend to use names. Used to be a regular though, but he got barred 'cause he started smacking some of the girls about. - So he's local? - Yeah, he's got some dingy little place off of Harris Drive. Some of the girls used to go there. - Can you show me? - He's got a flat about here. Hang on. J.C. what number flat is that rougher on Harris Drive? Harris Drive? What number? She doesn't know exactly, sorry. She does know he lives on the ground floor, though. - Do you know if he's got any family there? I doubt it. - Hmm, thank you. You've been very helpful. - Are you sure there's nothing else that we could do for you? What's the most expensive thing on the menu? - Well, you can do anything you want for two-fifty. - Why don't you take the night off. - Come back any time. - Hi. Listen to me, you're gonna help me find your friends. If you do that, you'll get off much lighter than them. If you scream, if you try to run, if you do anything other than what I tell you, I will kill you. Do you understand? I'm sorry. - Don't you fucking tell me you're sorry. You get nothing. Nothing. Where are the other two? - Who? The other two. I don't know. - I'll just have to make do with you then. - Wait. They're together right now. Near here? - Five minutes. - Drive? - Two minutes. - Good. What are you going to do? - You will take me to them, but you won't have to see. - So, uh, we're taking the camera out tonight? - Why, Randall, would we take the camera out tonight? - Well, I. - So which one is it? - It's up front. Five. - Top floor? Hmm, I'm nearly done. Nearly. - And then my boy says to her, "Oy, love, show us what you piss with." - She always stood with Randall. - How does it feel? - Come on Tommy, let's get a move on, eh. - Steve's a big boy. He can make his own way to town. - Yeah, all right. Let's go. - How could you do that to her? I asked you a question. - I don't know. - Really. I actually think I believe you. I bet you think this is so unfair. It's going to be a hell of a night. It's going to be a hell of a night. They can help you. Tom and Randall smart. You said you'd let me go. - I am letting you go. - Oh, Steve. Stevie! The fucking bastard. My little brother. - How'd he find us? - It doesn't matter. I'm going up there. - Now Tommy, wait mate. - Could you wait? I'd appreciate your help. Since you were the one that got us into this. - No, it's you that got Stevie into this. - What's the matter, Roy? You scared of getting your hands dirty? - All right, I'll help. - Can you get us any firepower? Yeah, it's a bit late notice, but. - Shit. - Nice place. - You want to just burn it? - No. There is no point in missing an opportunity. - That's great Randall, yeah. Perhaps if you fuck it up this time, we come back and you make a trilogy. - Well it's just nice of you to come along this time, Roy. - There's a back entrance. Randall, take a couple of boys and see if you can flush him out that way. - Right. - Oh, Brett, watch your back. - Wait. Torch. Shit. Get upstairs. Come on. Ah, shit. - Jesus. Shit, shit. - Jesus Christ, Randall! Randall! Randall, hey. - We gotta go. Not until I- No, I don't care, right, I don't care. He ain't normal, Tom. Look, I like Steve and that, but we just gotta forget it. He knows who we are. So we change our names. Move, I don't know. Please, mate. You gotta trust me. - All right, now fellas, if he can find you he can find me. Well, you can stay if you want to, mate. Oh, fucking brilliant. What the hell's he playing at? Come on. Randall, shut the cover off. You're so fucking dead. Where is he? - Everyone, shut up. - Yes, Tom, you fucking legend. No way. Tommy, why! - That ain't going to hold him. - You can shut the fuck up or you can fucking help. - Wakey, wakey. Now what the fuck is going on? - I'm sitting down again. How's the parrot? You were there too, weren't you? - Stop talking. - How do you sleep? - Just fine. Especially with the money from your wife's movie. Yeah, that's right. That fella over there sold it to blokes who enjoy that shit. They enjoy it. Who knows, maybe they even beat off to it. Me, I sleep just fine. How 'bout you? Huh? I'm gonna stick this knife in every inch of your body. I'm going to cut your fucking head off. I'll find a way! - You feel better? - I wouldn't put it like that. - But you got what you wanted. - So what's left? - You are the most stubbornly human thing I have ever encountered. Do you not feel what you are capable of? - It's not as simple as that. - It is. Come with me. Join the rest of us, and all that suffering will disappear. There's no pain, no regrets. You felt good this evening? - It was incredible. - Right. That is my existence. You can do whatever you want. Like memories, there are those of us who can remember every moment of their lives with perfect clarity, and those are long lives. - I can't think of anything worse. - That is because you are clinging to all these feelings. You know what, when I look at humans all I see is that they're all trying to get revenge for something. A bad job, terrible childhood. All that anguish and turmoil. We are free of it. I mean, don't get me wrong. We love each other, genuine love, and we feel, god, we feel in a way that they cannot even imagine, because we're not bickering, we're not clawing and clambering like they are. - How many are there? - There are a few hundred of us. If we lose one, we find another. It's my job. - What gives you the right to live off of people? - We don't think in terms of rights. Besides which they do exactly the same thing. All sorts of animals. - Oh, please, it's different. - Yes, they don't have to. All right, how about this. Among our species there has never been a war, never a crime of passion, and no one has ever, ever done anything like what those men did to you. You can't stay here, you know. - I know. I've been missing the sunlight recently. I think I'll go catch the dawn. - The others will be disappointed. We will know if you haven't gone through with it. - I will go through with it. - Hmm. - Am I going to hell? - Do crucifixes hurt? Hell is a human creation. Hell is anything better than they are. I don't know what's next. - Sunday morning. Never make friends with a human. - I miss you.
