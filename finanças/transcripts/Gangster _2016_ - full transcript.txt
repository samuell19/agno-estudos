FF May I help you, sir? Hello? What's your name? Sir, your name please? Kabir. Good morning. Very good morning! Your tea is ready. Kabir... Can't believe I've been drinking your tea for a year... So what are you getting me? It's a surprise. Maybe you'll like it. Really! Even I have a surprise for you. Something very special! Just come home and see... I'm coming... Just a couple of more things to buy. After all I need to make lunch for her majesty. It is a husband's duty. Ok. So bye for now- - One minute! You haven't charged your phone again- No, no. It's fully charged! And in any case, I am coming home. In a year, you haven't learned to lie one bit. If I learnt I'd miss your scoldings. Come home and I'll only scold you. No food! Stop giggling and come home. Let's eat breakfast together! I'm coming... Bye... Whoa! One sec... Here! Pass the ball... Stop giggling and come home. Let's eat breakfast together! Even I have a surprise for you. Something very special! Just come home and see... Hello? Quick! Quick! Quick! He's bleeding a lot! What do you whisper every morning? Just one wish... That I should die before you... and gift you my aura- My aura is yours... Quickly! Get the OT ready! Scissor please... Scalpel... Kabeer has been shot several times. This... This is what you wanted! - Ruhi! No! I wanted to shoot him myself! I've dreamt about it for 10 years. From the day I chose to walk this path... I had forgotten to fear death. Just one word... Target! Hit it and you live. Miss it and you die. I heard that your brother's a junkie... Serving his drug peddling sentence, aren't you? Good, good. These cases keep you in prison for at least 5 months. You'll have to eat this rotten bread till then... But will your brother survive that long? Tell me... I can get you out of here in 8 days. 8 days... Will give you some money too... One small job... Your cell partner, Ajay... Need to hold it to his neck... One small slit... That's all. Game over. Or else the game takes a twist... Look at this Kabeer. Our enemy! He was bugging us for days. You see Kabeer... When there is no need to kill... Then why kill at all? Where were you? What's this? What happened to you? Kabeer? Jamwal sir... What's your name? Kabeer (Magnificent). What an unapt name... He's crazy. He killed him in one go. Boss! Make him your lackey. Chotu, you have to be crazy to make history. Just you see, this boy will be king... He will make history... He won't be a lackey... He'll be a Master (Guru) Not Kabeer... Your name is now Guru. From today you are my son. My son... So... Will you be my son? Will you? From then on Kabeer started becoming Guru... I became Jamwal's son. I would do exactly what my Father told me to. Baba (Father) has cancelled the deal. Baba has cancelled the deal. Sit! Fear can turn even a dog into a lion, so don't get scared. What's your number? 32! Phone number! Give me your phone! My phone? Ya! Where are you going? Finish the conversation! Bye! Is your party over? Hey! He asked you something! I think he's deaf. Hey! Guru talks less and pops more. Guti likes a few things and what he likes most is... Sunny Leone! - Yes! When is her show? You have to finish in one and a half minutes. Now that Guti has said it, it must be done. In this 1.30 minutes you may not grow brains but you'll definitely grow lumps! Hey! I had not planned on killing you today. But plans can be changed. What about these two? They were making fun of you too... Finish them off! When there is no need to kill, why kill at all? Someone had told me this... Get the parcel ready. Salami is good, isn't it? Zakir Bhai, please eat. These are local fruits... Guru shouldn't have killed Tommy's men. There's no profit in making enemies with Tommy. Only loss... What is the fun of business without loss? My son is here! Come sit. We promised not to enter each others territory. If you didn't like the deal, you could have said no. This violence is unnecessary. If everyone goes around showing off their power... There'll only be war... and no business. Sit down. So who was talking about business? My father used to say... When you eat, eat in peace. What's wrong, son? Guru did the job I assigned to you? I murdered someone to save my brother. And you... couldn't wait a day more? You killed my brother... Look at my hands... Look... My hands are stained with blood. Look! This is what you wanted me to do? This is what you wanted to make me... A murderer! Very well! Then this is what I will be. Because it's what you want? This is the path you've shown me. From today... you will profit too! You will get a share. From today you are my partner. My partner in crime. Profit or loss... we'll share it equally. The partnership is doing well. You increase my business and... I increase your share. Don't worry... these hands have seen much blood since Ajay. Leaving without Sajda(Prayer)? Kabeer? One day God will send you a Farishta(Angel). That will be the day you perform Sajda. There you go... A phone call from my Farishta. Yes, Baba... Beta(Son)... My own kitten is biting me today. Kill Vishnu! Just keep it there... Going against Baba? I have not gone against anyone. I'm walking a straight path. Does leaving crime imply that I'm going against him? Want to shoot me? Then do it. Vishnu is not afraid of dying. Atleast I will die a gentlemans' death. Just leave. Go somewhere far away. Next time I won't be able to stop myself. Last night gangster Vishnu was mysteriously murdered. The police have begun their investigation. I knew you wouldn't do it. It was a small job thus Chotu(The tiny one). But why kill Vishnu? He just wanted to live a regular life- Beta! In our business a regular life... is impossible to maintain. Always remember... A man who shoots with you today may shoot at you tomorrow. And Chotu didn't kill him. He was dead the day... he decided to surrender his life. What do you think son? Think our life is here? No! Our life is here! And Vishnu... He gave up his life. Don't make the same mistake twice. Move! Three of my men had gone to talk business with Jamwal. How many returned? Two! I couldn't even find the others' body. I want a body! Guru's body. Can you get it? No problem, Tommy sir. We meet here. Your physique doesn't suit a gun... it suits a chillum(smoking pipe) Will you ever fight your own battles, tommy? You should stop sending these useless rentals. Your parents did a good job... naming you Tommy. Both your name and behaviour... resembles that of a dog. If you step on a dogs tail, it will bite. If I pull the trigger you're dead. But what's the point? You're worth more to me alive. A lesson! Many will learn a lesson by seeing you. So... from today 70% of your business is Baba's. Do I look like an idiot who will give 70%? You will look like an idiot... if you don't comply. Think about it carefully. What is bigger-life or business? Remember the saying... There is always a need for calculation in emotion. Cheers! Profit! Profit! Mr.Tommy has made a profit. He has got his life in exchange for 70% of his business. Guarantee of life is a big thing in our business. Hello, Mr.Jason. Cheers! Do you like this deal or not? Let me explain. Say you are asked for 70% of your business at gun point. Wouldn't you take the deal? Why so serious? I'm joking! I'm joking! Joking... My son... Chotu! I have a gift for you. This is for the 70% You have given me great joy! Wear it... Hello Mr.Jamwal! Cheers! Hey! Hey! Hey Guru! Are you ok? I'm ok. Give me some water. It was right here... Wait a minute... Where is it? There we go! Here. Guti wait! Hey! Hello! Hello! Could you please help me? Hello! Hello! One day God will send you a Farishta(Angel). That will be the day you perform Sajda. Oh my! You are badly hurt! Oh my! Even you are hurt! Let me see... Give me one minute. It hurts, doesn't it? What's your name? How did this happen? Who the Hell... You've lost your memory, haven't you? Guru! Hey Guru! Oh my! Please help me... Please help me! I can't pick him up. Please! Thank you! Thank you so much! Are you ok? Let me see. What the- I think he is very ill. Is it hurting? I am so sorry. Let me see. How did this accident happen? Guru! I am talking to the two of you! You don't understand Bengali, do you? Does no one understand? You get to the hospital. I will take him. Thank you! Thank you so much! Sir! This is Guru's friend's car. Sir! Call an ambulance. - Ok, sir. We all have to do our part... Hey! Hello! Hi! 1 minute. You are exactly like me. You treat and you come to meet. Hey you! Thank him for helping you yesterday. Say thank you! Although you look like a pauper... Do you have some money? Excuse me! Why are you still here? This is a private hospital, not a charity house. These kids will do drugs and fight and we- Hello! Uncle! - Uncle? Just do your job. How much money do you need? I'll give it wait! 1 minute. Never judge a book by it's cover... I take back my pauper comment. And hello uncle! Now go treat him! Oh! You're here! Come, come... How are you? You can't do drugs anymore... Go to sleep. Howcome you aren't studying? Dada(Big brother), let me sleep! Oh! You studied all night... Ok. Get some rest. Hello! Don't go anywhere! I need to return your money. Hey! Why was your car there? - Sir, please wait... Sir calm down... - Tell me! Susu! I want to pee. I didn't do anything sir... Give me a minute. - Who were they? My shirt will tear and the car will break. One minute sir... Shouldn't be so brutal! Hey! - Yes, sir? Who killed them? Not us, sir. Not you? - Not us. Who killed them? - Don't hit my head. You or Guru? - My head... Your car was found there. One minute... - Tell me? It was an accident. Many cars pass at great speed- You're teaching me the difference between an accident and murder? Sir, highway... Tell me! - Highway sir. Please avoid the head. Sir, look at the highway. That is a highway. Sir, don't you know what a highway is? Hey! Sir? No evidence, no witnesses and no warrant. And yet you forcefully picked up my friend? Take him back if you want. Get up if your alive. Hi! He's a real box of tricks. That's why he's still alive. Else his wings would have been chopped long back. You're very proud of your friendship, aren't you? This doesn't work in your business. One day your best friend- - Will chop my wings? There may be various points of view. There's a saying... You can fix the eyes but not the view. Remember how many you killed that day? This time you have left evidence. What are you saying, Shiv Babu? Are you saying I'm a murderer? Who did I kill? I just visited one of them at the hospital? You can check if you'd like. You're a slick worker and talker. The day I get any evidence, I will shut all of it for good. Just look at this! You've known me for so long and yet you never asked how I am. Not the slightest enquiry about my injuries. One more thing, Shiv Babu... you are a pretty slick worker and talker yourself. God speed! Why were you so late? I wasn't late. My timing was perfect. Hi! Let's go. Hi! Hi! We are truly fated to meet each other. I am not one of those debtors who run the other way. Why is it that someone is always injured when I meet you? Ow! Easy! Turn this way! Do something... Keep this. Keep applying it regularly to avoid infection. What happened? What are you thinking? You think I'm paying my 20,000 debt by giving you an antiseptic? No... No! What you are thinking is wrong! One minute. Give me your phone number, address and name. I will deliver the money at your doorstep. No... There's no need for that. No need... No need! Think you can buy me for 20000? The name's Ruhi. I will return every penny! What's your name? Ruhi... What's your name? Kabir! - Guru! Your name's Guru? Ya... That's what they call me. Yes! The name carries weight! Guru! Mahaguru(Grand Teacher)! Guru is your name! Khoka(Little boy), can I say something? I shouldn't say it but... the name Guru sounds very nefarious. I'll call you Kabeer. Kabeer... Give me your number? All lines to this route are unavailable. I'll give it to you. +44 - +44 391239! I'll call you once I get the money. Bye! Take care! In the sunshine of your name, I have drowned in the sea, And I know not how far I will go... In the sunshine of your name, I have drowned in the sea, And I know not how far I will go... In my cursed life, In my nights and days, You have come and I know not why... My heart plans to run away... But it is trapped with you... If you want to know the truth, I want you... If you want to believe a lie, I want you... If you want to know the truth, I want you... If you want to believe a lie, I want you... In just a week, We have started playing games all day... And I am unable to stop it... In temples and mosques of your name... I have made many a promise... Let the drops make an ocean, But you please paint me the way you wish... If you want to know the truth, I want you... If you want to believe a lie, I want you... If you want to know the truth, I want you... If you want to believe a lie, I want you... In the depths of my heart, And with a sleepless mind, I will drown with you... I now have many reasons, To discover myself... If you want to know the truth, I want you... If you want to believe a lie, I want you... If you want to know the truth, I want you... If you want to believe a lie, I want you... You know I was never in to the drug business... And I never will be. But this is our first order, Beta. Just do it the first time. The same way I slit a man's throat for the first time? How absurd! No means no! I can do the job instead of him! A smart man knows when to speak! Do you think I can't do it? Will you let go of such a deal? The job will be done. Only the methods will change. Oh my Baby Doll! Sometimes I feel like... leaving all of it. This dirty work, this business... I just want to set my life. Can't set your own hair- But I'm trying to set my life. I know. Remember what happened to Vishnu? I'm not Vishnu. Let's not get into this! Hey bro... Why does boudi(Your wife) call you Kabeer? Where did you dig up this name? Kabeer is a part of me that... even I had forgotten. Hello? Open! Open! It's A-Grade stuff, boss! We're going to be rich! I know. It's what I had predicted. Now just see how much more will come. This is just the beginning. It's not the beginning... it's the end! This is where it all ends! Hey! You're making a mistake, Beta. A big mistake! What you have done is an even greater mistake. You know... that Guru's heart does not forgive or forget mistakes. Ruhi! One minute. Hey! What are you doing here now? Actually I... What's wrong? Ruhi will you marry me? Just look at this, Amma! I said a few nice things and now this boy wants to marry me. What do you say? Should I marry him? Is the groom ok? He's like a diamond! God has sent him for you and us. Come on! Stand next to each other. You look so good together! Oh God! Do bless them! Amma... I'm not a good person. I am not wothy of your praise. I'm actually a... bad person. A very bad person! Ruhi, you know nothing about me. Everything you know is a lie. The truth is that I'm a killer. I'm a gangster! Ruhi? Ruhi! - Ruhi... Ruhi... Hold her... Hey! Inside! Get inside! Gangster... Gangster... Ruhi... This is not an addiction or a pleasure. It's not something that I can't stop. I joined this work because I was helpless. But I always wanted to leave. I just needed a reason. But now I have found a reason. You... What if I leave all of this? And never do it again? Then will you marry me? Baba! You call me your son. Well, I have brought my wife. Won't you give us your blessings? Tell me, you've got your wife here for the first time. Tell me what you want. Freedom. That's all I want. From now on I will only do what my heart desires. And I want to live as Kabeer not Guru. How can I say no as a father? But remember one thing... the weapon you give up today, will be taken up by another tomorrow. And it may be aimed at you. I've told you this before. Think about what you are doing. If I dwell on tomorrow, I will never enjoy today. I will do what I have decided. See you. In the world that I have left behind... stories start after someone has been killed. The stains of blood are not easy to forget. And my only fear is... Will I be able to protect you? I know that... my Kabeer will give his life for me. Without any question. Just like this... Become a habit to me... I know there is no danger... And without you there is no life... Touch my finger, flowers will bloom and bodies will bathe. And let us promise to never stay out of sight. Touch my finger, flowers will bloom and bodies will bathe. And let us promise to never stay out of sight. Someone like you... Makes promises and then disappears. A wave like you... Takes me far away... Touch my finger, flowers will bloom and bodies will bathe. And let us promise to never stay out of sight. Touch my finger, flowers will bloom and bodies will bathe. And let us promise to never stay out of sight. Why were you fighting for 5 bucks? It's not about the 5 bucks. It's about honesty! The guy was cheating us. Ok, relax. I'll be back in 5 minutes. Get him... - Catch him! No one hits him. He hit my brother! No one will lay a finger on him! Uncle! Go! Or I shoot you! Go! Go! I thought Guru had resurfaced. Guru? Who is that? I am Kabeer. Ruhi's Kabeer... I want to keep you with me, In the morn and in the eve... If you do not call out, I will stay mum, In every day and every noon... Just like this... Become a habit to me... I know there is no danger... And without you there is no life... Touch my finger, flowers will bloom and bodies will bathe. And let us promise to never stay out of sight. Touch my finger, flowers will bloom and bodies will bathe. And let us promise to never stay out of sight. It's a miracle he's regained consciousness. We need to make arrangements. Here comes the twist in the tale! Welcome back! What should I call you? Kabeer or Guru? Ruhi... The real pain was felt here... How did I survive? Ruhi I want- - No Kabeer! First I want to say something. Your father was right. If you drop your weapons, others will take them up against you. You may have left this world but this world hasn't left you. I took you out of that world. And today I'm telling you... Go! Go back! Take revenge on those who have done this to you. What's the need Ruhi? You- - Kabeer! You had promised... that you would never question me. Fine. I won't say a word. But do you realise that you are sending me to war? Kab- War? The war has already begun. They started it. And guess who will finish it? My brother! The first thing I saw as I got shot was your face. And then I remembered the things you used to say. I really felt like talking to you. I tried aswell. But I had lied about my phone being charged... And lies do not hold for very long. Isn't that true, Ruhi? You'll take red so I shall take blue. Here. It's your turn. You gave them a chance to attack you. Who were they? I don't know, Baba. They were all wearing masks. When you fire 1 bullet you create a 1000 enemies. I'm sure you don't have count of the number of people you have killed. Don't worry. I'll try and find out who they were. Distance is created by this... And the heart bridges that distance. No matter how much you try to push me away, you are always here. You are my son. I'll throw you off! Trying to kill Guru? Guru... Guti, where are you? I have found out who they are! I have one of their guys with me. He supplied the guns. The guns! Guti don't hit him. - Supplied guns! Know who they were... Jason! Tommy! Chotu! And... your father. - Cheers! Jamwal Saheb. From today you are my son. You know why? I know. Because a lack of support implicates opposition. Freedom! From today I will do what my heart desires. How can I say no as a father? But remember one thing... the weapon you give up today, will be taken up by another tomorrow. And it may be aimed at you. Rubbing salt on your own wounds? Feels bad, doesn't it? When those closest to you disappoint? I felt bad too. I felt terrible. Why have you started smoking again? Kabeer, I'm talking to you. You are still here? Haven't you slept all night? I have found out about all those who had shot me. I was slaughtered by my nearest and dearest... Nearest and dearest... Who do you mean? I'm not sad because... my nearest and dearest tried to kill me. But I feel disgusted at the fact that... they are still... pretending to care about me. So... What... now? Guru! Hi! So, are we going to the hospital? Let's move! Whose wife is this? Hey! Ok! See, this is my wife Iram. This is Ruhi! And this is my son Melih! Hello! - Melih say hi! Guru uncle! So, you girls stay here. And you come with me to the hospital. I will go too. It's fine you don't need to- No, I want to go. Let me get my bag. Ok. Ruhi sit here. I'll be right back. I'm going with him. Kabeer! Ruhi! Guru! Our baby! Our child Kabeer! I thought I'd tell you everything last night... You were right Ruhi. They haven't spared me. Not even my child... Then why should I spare them? Let it be Kabeer. You don't want to return to that world. You don't want to fight. So let it be Kabeer! Call me Guru! Gangster Guru! No one can stop this fight. Now they will face my wrath! I promise. Kabeer! Get out Guti! This is my fight. And I have lost everything already. But you have a family. So go... You've gone mad! You haven't lost everything! Your child is gone. But what about your wife? She's still there! Isn't she? How can you tell me to leave? Friendship is greater than all your love and marriage. You think things have changed in a year? Listen carefully, I am going with you! Guti leave! - No I won't! Saying the same thing over and over... See you. Then do one thing... Take care of Ruhi. And yourself too. My brother! Where are you going? To war! And I have a lack of time and patience! Where is Guru? - I don't know. Why are you sending him to a certain death! You know that he will not return alive! My baby was right here. Kabeer's child! My child is not here anymore. My baby has been murdered by them! Now I can't stop him. No one can! You know who tried to kill Guru! Guru knows it too. Who tried to kill Guru? Jamwal? Tommy? Who was it Ruhi? Tell me! Please! Please! We should have been celebrating now. At this time Ruhi and I would have been... She would have liked something sour at this time... And I would have made it for her... I would have made her something... Here. Eat this. I cook pretty well now. Ruhi loves my cooking. Does she really like it or maybe she... Ruhi is the only one... who has ever seen any good in me. My sins grow deeper than the ocean. Maybe that's why I've lost everything. See that chair? It should not be empty. He is making me pay for my sins. Don't be scared. It's my nearest and dearest. Guti I had told you not to get her here! She's not safe here! There's a great risk! I tried to stop her but... I insisted! I can't live without you Kabeer! Let there be fear and risk! Who knows... how much time... you have. Or I have. But no matter what... I want to be with you! I can't live without you! I won't go anywhere! Sometimes to get closer we need to go far away! I won't listen to a word! You will listen to me! I want to be with you! What will you do when I am no more? You should get used to living without me... Will you be able to live without me? So much love is not good Ruhi. Coz love makes mistakes. Hey Guti! Go home. Your wife and child must be missing you. No! It's ok. Just go! Go. Leave if you want, Forget me if you wish, Promise me if you please, That you shall never let me go... Leave if you want, Forget me if you wish, Promise me if you please, That you shall never let me go... The sunrise with you next to me... Is all I want. It was the scent of your hair that brought me back from the dead. I am alive because of your love. Don't you ever think... that it would have been better if you had never met me. Your entry in my life was a huge turning point. I hope you know that. Meeting a gangster can be a turning point in anyone's life. You know what your mistake was? You decided to start a family with him. I will tell you everything... Come become... my beginning... and my end. The sunrise with you next to me... Is all I want. To sleep beside you... Is all I want. Kabeer! Your name brings peace... To my heart. With you I want to spend... All my days. A red rose in your hand... Heals my every wound. The sunrise with you next to me... Is all I want. To sleep beside you... Is all I want. Leave if you want, Forget me if you wish, Promise me if you please, That you shall never let me go... The sunrise with you next to me... Is all I want. To sleep beside you... Is all I want. Guru I haven't done anything! Why my child? You are making a mistake... You could have killed me, but why my child? Child? Guru listen to me... Why did you kill my child? Guru! Guru listen to me... Why the child? Why did you do it? Why? Guru, he's dead. Guru let him go... Guru... I have lived with regret all my life... Yes, my son... I wish you had never turned me in to Guru. But now it is your turn to regret. You will regret transforming me from Kabeer to Guru. With the time that you have... The time you have left to live... you should figure out if there is anything you haven't taught me. Something that can save you from me. You made a mistake, Baba. You made a big mistake. Why isn't the AC working? - It is boss. Then why am I sweating? You got this idiot? What will he do alone? He's useful boss. Him and his partner will get the job done. Then tell him to do something. Or else, who knows what Guru will do with me. Hurry it up a bit. - Hmm. I'm done. Let's go. Sorry... Ruhi leave. I can't leave you. I am ordering you to go! I won't go! - Go! Please go! Guru? Have you ever seen Salman Khan up close? You haven't. Ever seen Amitabh Bachchan from afar? Haven't seen him either. So how can you think that a man like Guru will show himself to you? Kabeer! Guti! Guti... Get up if you're alive. Guti, my brother... Get up if you're alive! Don't fool around! Guti... Hey Guti... Guti! Tommy! Tommy! Where is Tommy? Tell me! You'll be killed like your friend! Guru! Where is Tommy? Tell me! With your wife... Guru? Bhabi Ji (Sister-in-law)! You are shutting the door on me like I'm a stranger. Let me remind you of who I am. About a month back Guru was shot at by 5 people. Jason, Chotu, Jamwal and me. You must be wondering why I'm telling you this. Because Guru doesn't know... that the fifth person was... his wife! Business is all about give and take. So I will give Guru information... and in exchange he will give me my life. That's Guru's style. To play with his heart one must really use their brains. Ofcourse you know it best. That's how you've come this far. What do you think? Think I'll let you go? You think? I shot my own husband. You think I'll spare you? Just kill Guru and we can all live. You want me to kill Guru? Why should I kill him? Guru is doing exactly what I want him to do. He's killing everyone I want to kill. And you think I'll let you spoil the game now? You think I'll let you ruin it? Ruhi open the door! Kabeer... He came to kill me Kabeer... My heart! Where do you want to go? Where shall you find peace? My heart! Where do you want to go? Where shall you find peace? My heart! Where do you want to go? Where shall you find peace? My heart! Where do you want to go? Where shall you find peace? In the end when you stare... You'll see the tree of life is bare. The tree of life is bare. The tree of life is bare. The tree of life is bare. Stop it now. You have lost a friend and a child. Now let me stand by you. Very well! Then arrest them before I kill them. Can you do that? Kabeer? Where are you going? Kabeer, I'm talking to you! Where are you going? Kabeer! The lake of the heart has been soiled, And this crazy heart took the dirt for gold. You were getting irritated, weren't you? You were anxious for your profit and your partner. So here, after a year, your partner has returned. Guru is back! I have got all the money made from my sins. Keep it all! Even if there is no partnership, you will get your share. The lake of the heart has been soiled, And this crazy heart took the dirt for gold. He doesn't appreciate my Sajda. Kabeer? What is this poisoned game? Immortality masked in pain. What is this poisoned game? Immortality masked in pain. What is this poisoned game? Immortality masked in pain. If you stop and stare... You'll see the tree of life is bare. You'll see the tree of life is bare. You'll see the tree of life is bare. You'll see the tree of life is bare. You have caught a snail with your bait, It is not a snail but a snake you have kept, You have caught a snail with your bait, It is not a snail but a snake you have kept, My heart, tell me the truth... What shall you live for? My heart, tell me the truth... What shall you live for? My heart, tell me the truth... What shall you live for? If you stop and stare, You'll see the tree of life is bare. You'll see the tree of life is bare. You'll see the tree of life is bare. You'll see the tree of life is bare. What are you doing here? I had come to dump a body. You made a fool of me by leaving your car here. Take your phone on your way out. I think the battery is dead. Who is next? If you see that one of them is missing... Use your powers of assumption. God speed. Do you want to kill me? No... I thought it was someone else. No one else will come. Today is the last day of this game. Are you hurt, Kabeer? I'm ok. Jason is dead. Now just one more. Just one more... What's wrong Ruhi? Why are you getting scared? Don't worry. Nothing will happen to me. I won't go away without meeting you first. I promised you, didn't I? I will take revenge, just like I had promised. I'll finish them all and then... I never thought... I'd see a day like this after you came in to my life. You made me Kabeer again. Where has this life taken us? See you. Stay safe. Baba! Baba! Baba! Jamwal! Shit! You had lied to me. You said that you didn't know who attacked Guru. That's a lie. You also know who Guru is going to kill and when. You were with Guti when he was murdered, right? When I said Guru knows who shot him, you weren't amazed because... you knew who had shot him. No, no. I don't have time for your games. One by one, people are disappearing. Chotu! Tommy! Jason! Whose next? You know it all. Tell me! You know who tried to kill Guru. Tell me! I don't know who those 5 people were! I don't! I never said that there were 5 people. Baba! Hold! What did you think? Only you feel pain? What about me? I thought of you as my son. I spent my entire life... in transforming you from Kabeer to Guru. It was a mistake! A big mistake! The other day you were asking... if there was anything that could save me from you. Emotion! Emotion! I have killed my emotions. But you haven't killed yours yet. My dear boys... Listen... Beat my son until he's dead. Go! Tap Ruhi's phone immediately. I need some information. That's Jamwal's number? Ruhi and Jamwal? Shit! My dear boys, remember one thing... He never left a trace of his victims. Make sure the same is done with him. Kabeer? You know what your mistake was? You measured your relationships with your heart. And they used their brains. These relationships, this life... were all supposed to end one day. Let it be... We shall meet again... Somewhere else. In another place. This bag was left near the donation box. Allah! Help him! Don't worry. Nothing will happen to me. I won't go away without meeting you first. It's a bad time for you, Baba. You are shocked to see me alive, aren't you? You were right. I couldn't kill my emotions. That's why you are still alive. Even now. So today let's murder emotion... and finish you. Why Baba? Why did you do it? Why did my nearest and dearest- You didn't learn a thing. Not one thing! You couldn't kill your emotions in 12 years how will you do it in 12 seconds? Your hands were still shaking. It's a very bad time for you Guru. You're right Baba. I learnt nothing. I can't kill my emotions. But the things you have taught me in these 12 years... are impossible to forget. This is what you taught me. A small slit. - A small slit. My son! And game over. Will Kabeer finish Jamwal... Or will Jamwal... Guru was here. For sure. That means he will now go to Ruhi. But he won't believe that Ruhi has done this. But why will she want to kill Guru? What are you thinking about Ruhi? Kabeer? Yes, you are thinking about Kabeer. Who else can she be thinking about, Amma? Kabeer... How did this happen? I knew you'd be here. All this blood... How did this happen? Come with me. Where? Today, please don't ask any questions. Do you remember this place? This is where we first met. This is where our story began. Guru... and Ruhi's story. What a strange coincidence... I was injured on that day... and I'm injured today aswell. You were with me then, and you are with me now. It all seems like the same. No, there's a difference. The difference is that you don't have hiccups anymore. My love has quelled it. There's one more difference. My injury today... grows very deep. Your antiseptic can't cure it. Ruhi, I am very lucky to have you in my life. You have loved me, and I have loved you. You have transformed me in to Kabeer, a name I had forgotten. You have turned a gangster's crime story in to a love story. You made me dream like a common man. I dreamt of a family, a wife... and a beautiful child. But that didn't happen. Everything was perfect and it would have been perfect if... our story had begun from here. And not from the point where I had been shot. You made a mistake, Ruhi. It would have been good if I could have forgotten this scar. This one... The one so close to my heart. The one that you have given me. You could have killed a gangster but you killed my love instead. You made a mistake, Ruhi. The scent of your hair brought me back to life. I wish you had not sent me to war. But you made me do exactly what you please without a question. You made a mistake, Ruhi. It would have been perfect if my love had won. The love which never allowed me to question you. The love that forced me to keep my promise to you. It made me believe that you would tell me the truth. It made me believe that you would stop me but no... I kept waiting for the truth but it never came. It was a mistake, Ruhi. I wish you had taken out your anger on me alone... Atleast Guti and my child would have survived. But no... Now they're both gone. You made a mistake, Ruhi! I never saw my child but my best friend is gone. He held friendship above all else. So I should hold friendship above all else. Shouldn't I? So let me pay the debt of friendship. Let me quash my love. Let me take revenge. Your revenge? It is my turn to take revenge. Are you pained? Feeling terrible that I said nothing before? So be it! Today I will tell you all! You took too long... to show your real self. I wanted to see if you could point a gun at me. And you could. So be it! You want to kill me? Then finish this story. Kill me! Come on shoot! And don't tell me the reason. Because you have no right to say it and I have none to hear it! None of the dead will come back and I will never change. So shoot! I will! I will shoot! I will kill you. And I do feel bad about your friend. I didn't want Guti to die. But, your child? It has to exist in order to die. I made the plan on the day Guti had got his child to our house. The goons, the incident, it was all a part of my plan. It was a plan and there was no child! How could you stoop so low- Feeling bad are you? Feeling pained? Very pained? This is the pain I wanted you to feel. Jamwal had forced me to shoot at Kabeer. I had always wanted to see you as Guru. From Guru to Kabeer, Kabeer to Guru. I want you to feel pain. Because I have felt this pain for one entire year! I had died on the very day... that you murdered my Vishnu. Vishnu? Let me remind you. Just keep it there. - Ok! Vishnu just take a look... Hello, police- Vishnu! Vishnu! Don't be sad. Your Vishnu has died an honorable death. He died an honest man... Vishnu wake up... Get up! The scent of blood lingers... These are your words. Vishnu! So how could you believe that Vishnu's blood will be forgotten? My Vishnu was a gangster... like you. My Vishnu had changed for me... Just like you. My Vishnu loved me... The way you do. But how did he die? He died like a criminal. And you will too. Oh Ruhi... I expected you to know more about me... When Guru kills someone he never leaves a trace. You had Vishnu's body to cry over, didn't you? I thought that I alone was blinded by love but... you are worse. You befriended those who killed Vishnu. Go away! Go somewhere far away! Kabeer... But now it's too late. It's of no use. I did everything for your love and you say that you don't love me? Do you really think that you don't love me? My love is a lie, if you don't love me. My love has lost, if you don't love me. Kabeer. If you don't cry, then you don't love me. If you don't feel alone without me, then you don't love me. If you have no hiccups, then you don't love me. But if you love me even a little... then your love will bring me back. Kabeer! Kabeer! In the depths of my heart, And with a sleepless mind, I will drown with you... I now have many reasons, To discover myself... If you want to know the truth, I want you... If you want to believe a lie, I want you... If you want to know the truth, I want you... If you want to believe a lie, I want you... My heart wants to look back at you... And forget everything... and start afresh. But now you will feel pain when you look in to my eyes. That's why I had said... When you travel with someone on the road of life, it is tough to return alone. But you have to keep walking. Sometimes to come closer, we need to go far away.
