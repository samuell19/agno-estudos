All right. A brief little history of my toys. And this is the remote for my first remote-controlled car. I remember I was still in Minneapolis at my parents' apartment. We built these little jumps, like tiny jumps off the curb, but it was just enough that you could jump over a recycling box, or something like that. I wanted one of these things so badly. I remember this little punk up the street, Jordan Hamilton, he had one and he never allowed me to... bed for some reason, maybe I was sick or something. I woke up and there were these packages. But then my first ever clear memory of getting a toy... Hey. I'm your new neighbor. Whatcha playing? I don't know, some monster game. All right.

I think you should start with clips of the toys and then overlay your voice on top of those clips, it'll speed things up. I mean, overall, do you think I should pitch this to Arnon in tomorrow's meeting? Be harsh. - Uh. - What? My uncle came in, I think, no packages, he just pulled it out of his pocket. I mean, it's not like a fresh take on a web series, you know? It feels more like, uhm. Like what? I don't know, uh... it feels like something that we would've done in school. Well then, why don't you come over next week? Help me. I'm sorry, sir, but I'm really busy. You fucking liar, you're not busy. You've never been busy! Chris, just stop walking like that and tell me what's up. Legally, I can't tell you yet, but you know that iPhone sci-fi series I've been working on? Yeah, "Desert Pals" or whatever. "Desert Friends" yes. Dude, we got picked up! We're doing eight episodes. - What? - Yeah, I know! Arnon made the deal to move the show to TV. Well, streaming, you know, but still. - Holy shit! - Yeah! What's this? I want you to fix your truck. Just get a new radiator or whatever it needs. It should be enough, it's like 600 bucks. I'm not taking this. This is your money, this is your new guitar money. Or, this could cover the wedding lanterns. Okay, it isn't mine, babe. I mean, there's no my money or your money any more, right? I guess. It's kinda terrifying. What, no. You know the goal. We need to start producing our own steady stream of content. Right away. Let's steal something off YouTube if you have to. Conference room, let's go. On it. So it's obviously not a secret any more. We picked up our first in-house project, "Desert Friends". Yeah, Drew, you were right about Chris, by the way. He's such a weirdo, but you know, I think that's what makes his show so unique. Yeah, uh, thank you for introducing us to him. Of course. So with that in the works, we need our next project ASAP. Nate? All right, so I saw this doc about a priest who becomes part of this underground kickboxing league. No no no! It did great in fests last year, and me and the filmmaker, we can make it into... Next. Um, okay, page three. I actually know this director. He documented the sex trade in Uganda. The project was crowdfunded, so we have... No. Okay, so I know sex trade in Uganda sounds like, really fun and all, but uhm... We need something on the verge of blowing up. Steph, anything else? Nope. Nothing? Uh, sir. I have actually been watching a lot of documentaries recently, so if you wanted, I could brainstorm... I'm sorry, could you reschedule... ...schedule a meeting with the creatives for Thursday. All right, I'm on it. I do have an idea, though, if you have a sec. Have you heard of radio-controlled cars? It would be like a TV show where there's a variety show, you know, with jumping and... No, no. Sorry, sir. Maybe, um, tell me about your idea later. I think there's something It keeps leaking, and I put water in it, and it's all messed up. Okay, I'll look at it. We'll get you an estimate in about 45 minutes. There's wifi in the lounge. Thanks. You can leave your keys in the car, please, thank you. I'm walking to find a random hobby shop. I'm hoping they've got a battery for this baby. I know it's weird, but this guy gave me some of the best years of my life, and, I kinda wanna get it back up and running again. So I'm gonna document what it's like to get back into RC cars. Yeah hey, Steph? Yeah, no, I know, tell Arnon I'm, uh... ...there was a ton of traffic and I'm just gonna grab a sandwich. I'll be back soon. All right, bye. I've only been doing this 30 years, but here's what I would suggest. Now, you need to take a look at this. This truck's our bestselling car. It comes with everything you need, fully assembled, so you don't have to screw around with it. It's nice. Is it good at jumping? It's made for jumping. Check out the gorilla-ball suspension in this. That thing's made for jumping. That's massive. You could drop it off a building. 30 miles an hour. 30 miles an hour? That's what I just said, 30 miles an hour. All right, you got me at a particularly precarious time. I need to move some stuff. I like you. I'll put you in this for $295, out the door. What about this one? It's a racing buggy. You don't want a racing buggy! You don't want it, it's a heartache. Racing, like on a racetrack? Yeah, they got tracks all over the place, but it sucks the fun out of it. How fast does it go? With the right gearing, 60-70 mph. With the charger, with a controller, battery, it's gonna be $600+. Drew? So I went ahead and patched the crack for you, but it's temporary. Would you replace the radiator? Yeah, bro, I would. I'd replace it for $600, and I wouldn't charge you for the patch. What the hell, I'll take it! - Here you go. - No no no. Not that one. $550 cash, the rest on my card. I'm getting the racing buggy. Oh, did you get my text earlier about adding me on your insurance? Uh, yeah, yeah. Why do we have to get that maternity thing, that seems like a waste of $300. Well, people have been known to get pregnant, you know, when they get married. Okay. Sorry, anyway, you were saying Arnon's ready to hear a pitch, or something? Well, technically no, but Steph and Nate were just pitching such garbage, and I thought about what you said, you know, not really, you know, going with like a fully-formed idea, so I just blurted out the thing about RC car racing. Like from when you were 13? I know, I know, it's... He's trying to like, get me legit shows and tours and you're half-assing some shit about RC cars. I know, I know, it's stupid, but Arnon actually kinda wanted to hear about it, so I started to research it, and it turns out that RC car racing has this huge kind of following. Don't bring up toy cars. Nobody is gonna take you seriously. Fine, okay. Did you take your truck in? Yeah. Was I right, it was like $600, yeah? Almost exactly. That's what I thought. I'm gonna go, work on the garage. After you've thoroughly washed the body, you wanna make sure it's completely dry, and then your... Are you coming to bed? Just go to bed without me for once. What are you doing down there? I'm just cleaning up. Hey, Chris, what's up, man? Nice. Uh, I was calling to see if you wanted to maybe join... No way, pre-production. Sweet. Yeah, all right, bro. All right, here we are. My car's all decked out, looking real badass. And, I'm about to do my first-ever RC car race. Welcome to round five of the JBRL Racing League, Southern California's premiere radio-controlled off-road series! It's a perfect day out, and we have top competitors from every major team, some coming in from across the globe. After last week's race in Coyote, most of our classes are neck and neck as we make our way to the world championships next month at Desert Thunder! Hey, are you checking in? Uh, yeah. All right, what class? Class? Two-wheel drive, four-wheel drive, short course? Uh, it's, uh... It's an RC8B3, four-wheel drive. You do know that 1/8-scale buggies are like the most competitive, right? You're saying I'm screwed? How should I know? How's it going, man? Hey man, can I film you tinkering around with your car? Got a lot of new trick parts on them, it's less weight. Works really good. You think you've got the fastest car out there? Absolutely. So what's the deal with that one, why is that battery bigger than the other ones? This is a 14.8 volt and this is like 7.2. What we do is we put these in series to make them the same voltage. Our radios, they have telemetry, so we know what RPM our batteries are at, what our battery voltage is. Are you guys better than your parents? No. No, but you'd like to try? Still working on it. Who's the best one of you guys? - I am. - I am. Oh-ho-ho, that sounds like fighting words. Let's get those drivers back out to the track to turn marshal. Next up is our first 1/8-scale buggy qualifying race. This one is sure to be close, with Carhart, Chris, and Hanson all vying for the top spots in today's eight-man race later this afternoon. Here we go, here we go, here we go! Good luck, drivers, we're racing at the sound of the tone. Austin, Briggs right on the back of Carhart! Oh! The newcomer shoots right into the first turn! Rachel Carhart maintains the lead over the triple. Hanson and Miller follow close behind. Once again having some trouble, off the ground and making his way around as we approach the half-line. Brighton ready to follow through... Oh! Brighton's car is upside down again! And the battle is between Carhart and Forenza, getting tighter as we come back around the straightaway. Keep it clean, you can't win the race on the... Well, that was a disaster. Yeah, um, no, we're good on the... we're good on the 9x12, but 500 of each of the other ones. Yeah, and if you have, I don't actually know what the sizes are for it, um... the square ones, the 6x6? Yeah, perfect. Oh, hey, yeah, I'll call you back, bye. Hey, Arnon, I was just wondering if I could get five minutes of your time next week. It's about the RC car racing. I've been doing some research and it... Nate and Steph finally have some leads, and with "Desert Friends" in pre-pro, I need you supporting both of them, all week. Cool. I replaced the servo gears, changed the wires. I did a lot of work. I need to return this, it's broken. You opened it, we don't take returns on opened stuff. I told you that. You want a replacement part, I'll sell you a replacement part. I'll pay a restocking fee or something, I just need to get my money back. No. No no no, hell no. Come on. I'll give you $250 for everything, including the charger. You crazy? I just paid $600 for this. Well, it's what I can do. How much for the replacement part? Sorry. You suck. Sorry about that. No, I don't care if you run me off the road, I just mean you suck at driving. I know. So you blow $600 on the fastest buggy, and realize it actually takes talent? So now what, like, sell it on Craigslist or something? Do you think I could sell it on Craigslist? Maybe with some practice you'll be as good as me in like six years. But you're pretty good at jumping. No, I'm done. I already spent wedding lantern money on this, so I need to get rid of it and get back as much money as I can. So I think you should jump your buggy. You mean like, keep it and play with it at lunchtime? No, I mean like become the world's best RC car jumper there ever, ever was. That's like an official title or something? No, not yet, but it should be. You see this? "Send us your raddest RC car jump footage. "Video with the most votes wins $200 cash." That wouldn't even cover my cell phone bill. "Top three videos get a chance to compete "in the first annual long-distance jump off "Desert Thunder Championship June 24th." So? So I get invited to this race every year 'cause I'm the best girl racer in the state, but people like you that don't really have any skill, I don't know. Just thought it was crazy they're offering Yeah, Desert Thunder, that sounds just delightful. Whatever, dude. I have 20 minutes left for lunch. I'm so happy for you. Teach me how to jump cars. Like, now? I wanna win that video contest thing. Uh... Okay, yeah, you have to learn some control. Screw that, I don't wanna race! I just wanna film the cars flying. Right, but you have to go in a straight line for that. I know, I know, you can teach me how. Please? Okay, but not here. All right, video log #184. It's just a number, it doesn't really actually have any relevance to anything. Um, I'm here... I just, um... I just met this girl at the track, and um... it's, um, she just, she just, uh... What's your name, anyway? Rachel. I'm Drew. Watch out! Hey, we should bail. You wuss. Nice! - Dude! - What! What the hell was that? That was amazing. You should do the big one. Bigger than this? You wanna do the big one! You're crazy, dude. Do it, do it, do it! This shot is going to be amazing. No, you have to learn how to do the small jumps first. No no no no! The small ones were too small. That was the problem. No, listen. Do you wanna be a big jumper? Then you can't be a jackass. People who jump RC cars usually are jackasses. Well, how so? They launch their dumb monster trucks onto hard, flat ground, and they think it's funny to just destroy their cars, and it's not funny. It's sickening! So you're saying I do need a monster truck. No, I'm saying that if you do the jump right, then a light, fast buggy is the best. If you were to take your bike, do this ramp, completely miss the landing, and land, like, way over there, what would happen? I'd probably blow out my rim. Exactly! It's the same thing with this buggy. So you have to land it down the landing. Not on the hard ground, nope. You should want to jump these over and over. Like these dorks, like BMX, like motocross! You dress smart, be smart. Jump smart! Okay, got it. Jump it, jump it, jump it, jump it! Okay, here we go! - Hell yes! - Yeah!! We've got the natural cement, the reclaimed wood. You see the open pipes up there? Now this, this is the centerpiece of the whole piece. This drum, I actually got it in Africa. Why don't you join me in my office? Thank you. [phones ringing and chattering [RC car motor whirring on computer} Hell yeah! Woo! Uh, here's the promo footage. Thanks. Arnon said you could cut something by tomorrow? Sure. Okay. All right, here I go! Hell yeah! Babe, you need to try this cake so we can put in our order already. I'm taking a crap, get outta here! Yeah, you're almost my husband get over it. I don't care. Don't you have a sound check to go to or something? The baker said that our guests are supposed to know that the flavor we chose subconsciously best represents us as a couple. Oh my god, seriously? I think the red velvet is the winner. Yeah, yeah, I know, because the red matches your lips and the velvet matches the... I just don't care at all.

I don't know where Rachel is, she just left. I need to get back to work, it is not even noon yet and I've been on lunch for 90 minutes. Uh, so that's my day so far. Oh shit. So I've determined that I like you. How did you determine that? 'Cause I've never known someone to construct their own RC car ramp before. Really? It's almost done.

I think you guys are gonna really like this video. I did break my a-arm, though. Luckily Rachel gave me some spare parts. It's gonna be great, though. Here we go. Oh, nice. Are we happy with how these promos turned out? Nate's lead just went away. Shoot. Um, all right, well, I can make some phone calls. Close the door for a sec. Where have you been going? Look. I, uh... I wanted to get together a nicer edit before I showed you this, but this is what I've been doing. I've been researching and filming the RC world. I think it's gonna be huge. I could put an edit together nicer than this, and if you wanted me to, I could present it. Drew. Get the fuck back to work. Still organizing? Never-ending. I'm way too tired to cook anything. The kids were on speed today or something. Um, we need to talk. Yeah, I just, I need to change out of these clothes. Yeah, I know, it's gonna take one second. Arnon emailed me, if that's what it's about. I know he did. Okay, well, where have you been going at lunch, Drew? That's so weird. How is that weird? I've been taking... God forbid ...an actual lunch break, and then everybody starts treating me like... Okay, well, I just don't get why you're lying about it. Anyway, we can talk about it later, I just, I need food. Um, I'm taking a half-day tomorrow to catch up on some wedding stuff. Drew. Hm, sorry, what? I said can you help me tomorrow at lunch, 'cause we're gonna be gone all weekend. I can't take lunch breaks. That's what I'm telling you, this job is soul-sucking. Seriously? I find that really weird, because I watch kids, like, all day long. It's not like I have all this time to write music. It's like you have all these showcases, and then that Arizona gig right before the wedding, and then the freakin' East Coast Fall Tour. It seems like you spend a lot of time doing what you love. The day you've all been waiting for. The day where Rachel and I go big or go home. Now, if you like this video, or even love this video, please, please, please vote for it, and vote for it as much as you possibly can. Hey, we're still in fourth? Have you seen number one? Go go go! Yeah, I know, it's painful to watch. I mean, what the hell? They're jumping a car into a lake. Maybe your jumps just have to be bigger, and your landings have to be smoother? No, no, no. Look, I had an idea, okay? We need more shock value. Check this out. Bam. It's a house. Yeah, we jump the car over my house. You're a dumbass. What? Also, why did you not tell me that your dad owns this place? Well, that's exactly why I can't leave it unattended. Oh, come on. I'll bring you right back. I mean, no offense, but this place is pretty dead. Yeah, because we're like one sale away from going out of business. - I'm sorry, but look... - I thought you didn't wanna be like those idiots. You're not getting it, all right? This is like... think skateboarding tricks, but with RC cars. Nobody is doing this. It'll be incredible. Amazing. Pretty please. I'll buy you a Big Gulp. Fine. There we go, a little bribery, bam! So you really wouldn't go to Desert Thunder, even if you got invited to do the record jump? A week before my wedding? Yeah, I keep forgetting that you're getting married. Is it a fun event? Yeah, I hear it is. I thought you got invited every year? I do, but I'd never be able to drive up there on my own. Maybe when I move out. When are you gonna move out? Never. Why don't you just ask your dad to take you and get somebody to watch the shop for the day? I told you, my dad hates me racing. Screw that. Just... just ask him. Maybe if he's in an extra good mood today, I will try asking him. Hey, do two of you wanna go film in the back? Yeah! Cool, they're rolling. Let's do this. - Fuck! - Oh my god Holy shit! We got it! We got it, it landed! That was amazing! Wow! Hey! Say something to the camera! This is the greatest day of my life! Be careful! There's a car trying to come through. Drew! There's a car! Is that the fiancée? Should I walk home? Hey, I was kidding! I'm already late, you have to take me back to the shop! Leave me alone. Babe. Open the door. Don't babe me, please go away. We need to talk. I said leave me the fuck alone! I get it, you're upset. I can just keep picking the lock. If you need any help with the wedding stuff today, I'm around. Hey. Holy shit. You scared me. I need that drive. Uh, yeah... Thank you. I'm sorry, what am I supposed to do now? I don't know. But did Arnon tell you anything? No, we're all on set today. Drew, hey, this is Brian Lutes from Team Associated. Congratulations on winning the video contest, dude. Holy shit, that house jump? Ha! We're freaking out over here! Gimme a call back and we can chat about tomorrow's jump contest. We're gonna take a break from racing at noon to have the jump contest. Hey, Sadie. Can you just turn on the lights and come out? ♪ Ah ♪ You're like a dumb brick. I'm not upset because I didn't get wedding lanterns, which these aren't even wedding lanterns, these are just shitty lights. Okay, I'm pissed because I don't know where you've been or what the hell you've been up to. Look, I, look, I know, I know. I've been wanting to show you this for a while. I've been, I've been filming and editing RC car races. I mean, it's like what you said, it's the next step of my career. You have no career, okay? You are 26 and you literally have nothing going for you. I'm so sick of giving you advice and finding jobs for you and literally holding your hand through everything. I'm worried that you're never gonna get your shit together, which honestly makes me really worried about our future. What, so you don't want me to come this weekend? No. And that toy car looked really expensive. How'd I miss that on our bank statement? I just, uh... I patched the radiator. What, speak up! I bought it with the repair money. You spent my $600 on a toy. I thought you said it was our money! I honestly need this weekend to decide if I ever wanna see you again. Sadie. Hey, Chris. Oh my god, it's so big! Dude! Look at the girth on this thing, man. It's above average. Dude, wait til you see what's inside the studio. Can we go in there? Let's go. Sir, sir! The enemy is fast approaching! I don't advise you go into the asteroid field until we get the proper guidance systems. It's too late, we're going in hard! Oh... so fun. Do you think I should tell Sadie before or after the wedding? I mean, I'm just trying to figure out the right thing to do, man. Being honest doesn't mean, you know, dumping all your thoughts or bad feelings on your girl. I mean, no one can handle that. So like, is it okay to hide the truth, if it wouldn't do anything anyway? Of course. It's like, you wouldn't want her to confess every time she thought another guy was hot, right? Today's a big day. I'm going to Desert Thunder. I'm pretty excited. Sorry about the shitty quality of the video. Some girl stole my GoPro. There's the pinion gear that I'm gonna be replacing. Shell is ready. We have this baby, still gotta do some tweaks on that, but we should be good. Hello? Hey, is Rachel there? Hey, just wait outside, I'm almost ready. Actually, you can go around back. Hey! I'm over here, loser. Cool bike. You good? Okay, pack these. Rachel Catherine Carhart. I like that, it's elegant. R.C.C. Yeah. Wait, RC Car... hart? No comment. RC Carhart! How did I not know that your name is RC... It's my name, Drew. Pack my shirt, leave me alone. You were destined to do this. - I was! - Oh my God. I can't believe it. Chill out, it's just my name. Can you believe that? RC Carhart! RC! - No! - RC Carhart! You're not even packing right! We're never gonna leave. You have my shark. - It's my good luck shark! - I'm in shock, I just. He's mine, and so's my shirt, and so's my name. Leave me alone, Drew. You're making me very self-conscious. Black or white? Uh. Just kidding, duh, black. Whoa, hey, whoa, what are you doing? What?

I don't know, like, is your fiancée cool with you hanging out with another girl and going on, like, a... - Road trip? - Yeah, exactly. Just another girl, road trip, alone, without her. It's just like... I know I'm not like cute or desirable or anything, but... Hold on one second. We got into a huge fight last night. What, we're not talking now? I don't know, dude. You're just, like, totally lying to her like it's nothing. How am I lying to her? I dunno, I don't know much, but that's just like, shady shit. But forget I brought it up, I'm sorry. We'll just talk about something else. Fine, look, I feel bad. I just... I feel like there's some things that we... That I don't need to tell my girlfriend. Oh my god, all right, we're definitely changing the subject and from now on, we just talk about RC cars. I actually have an idea. What? What are we doing, drive. I don't get it. Can this piece of shit truck go faster than 50? This is a terrible idea! No, it's gonna be awesome! Go faster! I'm trying, my car can't. Holy shit. I'm doing it! Watch out, don't lean out so far. We're gonna have so many views! Hey, someone's coming! They think we're crazy! Drew, you're last up, and you have two attempts to clear Matt's record of 95 feet. Do we leave the ramp where it is, or start a little smaller? I'm gonna go for the win on the first attempt. Nice confidence, man, I love it, woo! We'll give him some space, give him some space. Whenever you're ready, Drew. All right, that is tragic. Hey, can we get some people to help him get his car back together? Oh my gosh. Tragic, tragic. I'm done! I'm done. Does anyone have a spare car? Uh, does anybody have a spare car just lying around for him? This is really, um... No, no! No way! What the hell are you doing? You race in 30 minutes. No, it's not up to you. My car was always faster than yours anyway. I can't handle the pressure. What is up with all these cameramen? Stop it, all right, I lost. No! You have another shot. Get outta my way! This will be his final attempt, using a replacement car ...his girlfriend's RC8B3. She's not my girlfriend! Correction, Rachel Carhart is not his girlfriend. I'm getting married next week. Oh, sorry, ladies, Drew's getting married next week! Whenever you're ready, Drew. Ah, well, I guess that's the end of the jump contest and we'll get back to racing. Just remember that we have 2 hot dogs for only $2, benefiting the... Hey, wait, where are you going? My race is about to start! Yeah, what car are you gonna use? Some guy said I could use his old one if I use my motor. Yeah, cool, well, do that, and then get a ride home with the cameraman. Are you just gonna leave me here? I'm just done with it, all right? I'm done with all of it. Are you gonna come or not? Fine. No, wait wait wait! Okay! fine! Dude, is there something wrong with your car? Is there a word worse than fuck? Oh, god. Hey, what the hell? Drew, what are you doing? Hey, can you just stop and talk to me? Drew, what are you doing? Stop! It's the videos. I gotta delete the videos. No, Drew, leave the videos alone. - Delete. - Don't. - Delete. - Don't do it. Don't touch the videos! Get away from me, all right? They're my videos! People love the videos, what are you talking about? Oh yeah, thanks, thanks a lot, hobby shop girl. Right, your fiancée probably doesn't even know you're here, does she? Clearly you don't wanna get married. Of course I do. I love Sadie. I hate that name. Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie! What, did it crack? Oh, it's wonderful, it won't even turn on. Thanks. I'm sorry. Can you please just admit that this was always something more than RC cars? Are you kidding me? - Just admit it. - No. Say that you like me, Drew! What, are we 12 now? Well, you're sure acting like it, yeah! Yeah, fine, okay, obviously, I love you! I mean, no guy spends this - amount of time with a girl... - You love me? Yeah, what? Dude, I... I know. Just skipped right on past like, then? This is obviously just some sort of fantasy. I'm on this path with Sadie, you know, this specific route, and... I gotta be a man and I have to stick it out! This is so messed up. None of this is funny at all! You're such a loser, Drew. I know. So, the mechanic says the car's not gonna make it home. Offered me $300 for parts... ...so, I'll sleep on it. Sleep on it where? I don't know, a motel. That's so true, and like, his suit was kind of like that same vibe, too. Like it was just too much. Where do you buy that suit? Where do you get... like, I've never seen a store that's like. I don't know, but you should get one. - Yeah, you like that? - Uh-huh. The motor and the speed control are fine, it's the fucking front end. Yeah, my shocks and my linkage are just done. Hey, can I see the purple one that's in your hand? - Sorry about that. - Thanks. Stealing all my tools over there. Your dad's calling. You're not gonna get it? It's not gonna get better until I move out. Does he know that you came along with me? I'm sure he does. Will he be pissed? Uh, honestly? He will most likely call the cops. Wait, really? I mean, what's the deal? My mom wrecked him. But screw it, I'm gonna move out and get a real job, and get my own place, and just put everything into racing. And, it will be great. Hey, what the hell? Did you sleep? Not very well. Getting close. God. It's a left up here, man. What? It's a left up here. No, Mom, that feature doesn't even exist. You can't find people on their phones, like, you can't find where they are. He's here. Oh my god, where were you? I was at a RC car race a couple hours away, and my RC car broke, and then my phone shattered, and then the engine in my truck exploded. Jesus. How did you get home? Bus. It was the worst weekend of my life. Um, Mom, yeah, he's here. No, he's fine. No, he didn't stay out at a strip club all night. Mom, I'm gonna call you back later. Okay, bye. Jesus. God... when you... when you didn't text me back, I just, like, I panicked, and I thought maybe you were bailing on me or something. No. I'm sorry I've been suffocating you, and I feel like we always just talk about me and my career, and I just want you to know that I'm really... Babe, can we talk about this later, please? Yeah. Okay, but I just wanna say that I want you to have hobbies and I'm sorry if I wasn't interested in RC cars. You know, they still sound really lame to me. But, I shouldn't judge you, and you shouldn't have to make up some bullshit story about how it's for work. Mm, work, yeah, it's a whole different story. Why, what happened at work? No, nothing, nothing, nothing. Really? Keep on going. That's it, really. I just... sorry I was a bitch on Friday, and... ...I just want you to know that I'm all in. Okay. I gotta close my eyes because they literally feel like they're gonna explode. You wanna go and get some food or something? I'm starving. Who's Rachel Carhart? Who? Oh, let me see. Oh, babe, she... I went to the RC track yesterday and she tagged me in some photos, it's nothing. But who is she? It's some chick who works at the RC car track. It's... I don't even know her. So why is she posting photos like this right before our wedding? I don't know why. Seriously, I don't know. She's your friend on here! Yeah, everybody's friends on here! It's nothing. I've talked to her like once or twice. Okay, but let's keep looking. And, there's like a whole casual fucking road trip in here! No, look, the thing is... okay. She's an RC car racer and she needed a ride to this contest. Seriously, it was nothing, it was not a road trip. No, no. Oh my god! That was her! At our fucking house. Last week when I caught you trying to jump the car and you were supposed to be at work and that... it was her! I don't... Like I wouldn't notice some cute girl in our driveway. - Okay, look, babe. - No! No, seriously, it's not... It's nothing, all right? We're friends, yes! Okay, we're friends, I admit it, but... Oh my god, stop lying to me! I'm not lying. I'm seriously not lying, okay? But you just, you have to understand, all right, that everything is really heavy right now, with the wedding and with work and stuff, so I wanted to have some fun. I mean, okay, wait, no, not fun, but like, I wanted to let loose, okay? So I went to this contest, and I don't know how to tell you this, but Arnon fired me, all right? So, when I went to the contest... Do you know that last week I came to your work to try to surprise you at lunch, and your car was gone. You were with her, weren't you? With Rachel. Maybe, I don't know. God, Rachel, I hate that name! It's such... Sadie, I know, hey. Hey, listen, listen, listen. Look, you have to trust me, okay? It's over. It's done. I'm yours, all right? I'm gonna be the man that you want, I swear. So nothing happened with her? Oh my god! Sadie, no, it... Look, okay, Sadie, Sadie, can you just, please... just listen to me, okay? Where are you going? You love this car so much, huh? Sadie, please. Just take it easy, ma'am. I'm looking for Drew Brighton, does he live here? Yeah, what's going on? Rachel Carhart has been reported missing by her father. She's just my friend. Sadie, what's going on? Her father said she ran away with you. - No. - Is she here? - No, she's... - No, just me, his fiancée. What'd you do, you probably raped her, didn't you, Drew? Listen, maybe you should come downtown and answer a few questions for us. Yeah, sure, fine. Can I get a ride? Sure. Hey, man, her dad finally called. I guess she wandered home, but she's safe, so you're free to go. Yeah, yeah, no, Mom, I got it, thank you. Yeah, I don't know, it's a nice, standard rental car, you know? No, Mom, look, it's not her fault, okay? Yeah, she just left, look... I fucked it... sorry, I screwed up, okay? I know, Mom, look, don't cancel the flights yet, all right? I'm gonna try to talk to her tonight. Alison, please. I know Sadie's there, I just need to talk to her a second. Hey, asshole! Catch. Yeah, thanks, Sadie. You never even wore this thing! Yeah, five years of editing and shooting experience. Bar mitzvahs and weddings? Uh, I'm not sure I'm the guy who should be editing wedding videos. Yeah, today. Yeah, oh, I'm gonna have to think about that. Can I call you back? Thanks. Chris, what's up, man? Yeah, I wanted to come by and see you film. You're sleeping? I thought you'd be... wait, what? Wakey wakey, hands off snakey. Dude, the place is trashed. Hey, man. Hey, dude. Saw you, uh, rented out my room to some real winners. They, uh... pulled the plug on my show. Just like that. Just... it turns out another network already had a sci-fi comedy lined up. It was pretty much the same concept. - Bastards. - Oh, dude. Shit. Hey, what'd you do this weekend? Dude, this is insane. I know. - 80 feet into cement. - Right? And, if I would've landed it, it probably would've been a world record or something. Do you wanna move back in, though? I could totally kick these guys out. No, no, no. I'm good, man. I'll probably end up moving back to Minnesota. Ew, no! No no no no, like, with your parents? A guy offered me this today. I could be a wedding video editor. Minnesota sounds better. I know, right? - It's depressing. - It is. Talking to him on the phone, too, just. What, so you're not gonna take it? I dunno. Should I? Well, dude, give me their number if you don't want it. Just relax, let me think about it. Pull out your phone. You got the number right now? You're such a little scavenger, man, god! Give me the number, man. Hey, Dad. Yeah, sorry I haven't called in a while. Sadie! I can't hear you, stop yelling. I... what are you, drunk? So where am I taking you? Alison's? No. So then where am I going? Sadie. Stay with me. I just wanna go home. Hey. Sadie, Sadie, Sadie. What? You were right. Okay? You were right about our dumb house. Our terrible jobs. And, uh... I can't imagine my life without you. Uhm... I want you to come on tour with me. You know, we still have time to be young and be stupid and poor and have fun and... I don't wanna do it alone. I think you should go. Babe. You gotta go on tour. You gotta do what you love. And, I... ...I need to figure out my life. I love you, babe. Take me back to the party. Alison's already on her way. What? You're such a loser.
