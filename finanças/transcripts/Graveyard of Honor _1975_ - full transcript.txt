TOEI PRESENTS RIKIO ISHIKAWA, THE HERO OF THIS FILM, WAS BORN ON AUGUST 6TH, 1924, IN THE EASTERN SECTION OF MITO CITY, IBARAKI PREFECTURE. ISHIKAWA'S BIRTHPLACE What was Rikio Ishikawa like as a boy? A real crybaby. He was always bawling about something. He'd cry for hours on end. Maybe because he lost his mother very early on. He was very shy back then. I never imagined he'd end up a yakuza godfather. He was very smart. He had natural intelligence. But he used his abilities for the wrong purposes. He was good at school. In most subjects. - Was he a headstrong boy? - He certainly was. He had a hard core to him. He stood out from the others, even doing bad things. He had a good head, he did. He was always our leader back in school because he was so smart. He was so headstrong. He always wanted to be a yakuza. - Did he say that? - Yes, ever since he was a boy. The would-be yakuza ran away from home in 1941 and went to Tokyo, where he joined the Kawada family. In 1943 he was arrested for his first assault and sentenced to one year in a juvenile detention center. According to legend, a rival punk had made the mistake of bad-mouthing Kawada, now Rikio's godfather. So, in that sense, he was the sort of kid who genuinely respected his godfather? Yes, he was paying his dues, learning his trade. Then what turned this young man into a rabid dog? Was it the chaos and confusion of the post-war years? That might be... But he was just as crazy before and after the war. When I was doing time with him, he once said, "I'm just like a balloon." A balloon? Meaning he'd keep rising higher and higher until he finally burst.

The best in shoe repair! Hey, what are you doing? - These sure do need fixing. - No, they don't. They'll be good as new. It's good leather, so they'll last. That's dried squid! They'll be as good as new. Cheap too, only 100 yen! Cough up, asshole! Thanks. So, how's business? Not bad. That the new boss of Ikebukuro? You know the drill. Later. Who gave you permission to work here? Who the fuck are you? We're free to work where we please. Like hell you're free! Quick! Run! Name's Rikio Ishikawa. I'm with the Kawada gang! What the hell! It's the Kawada gang! Move! Move! What'd you go and do that for? What if the Shinwa gang starts a gang war to retaliate? You're impossible! The boss already knows about it. You go apologize, you hear? Bro', our guest is leaving. We're thrilled to have American supplies. Yoshioka, we're stocked up with the real thing now. That's right. Hurry, put those away. Only animals wear shoes indoors. Boss... I'm sorry about what happened. KAWADA ORGANIZATION OFFICES You dirty animal! Shut the fuck up, you whores! Hey, Ishikawa. Hear you put on quite the show. Perfect timing. Let's talk. KOZABURO IMAI, FUTURE BOSS They're all "third nationals." They run a Chinese restaurant near Nakano station. They use it as their base to treat us Japanese like we're second-rate. MAKOTO SUGIURA Which is why it's about time we showed 'em what's what around here. Taiwanese, Korean and Chinese living in Japan, known as "third nationals," had been liberated by the Allied occupation forces. Their hatred for Japanese oppression during the war was now exploding into violence against the Japanese. Did you get 'em? I told you we would. From my GI boyfriend. Here's another one. Good. This girl's my babe. She whores out of Nakano. Hi there. Eat up. TAKUJI TAMURA, FUTURE LEADER OF IMAI FAMILY All ready to attack! How dare you! Why not! We're kamikaze. Could be dead in a few hours. Don't want to leave any regrets behind. Let me go! Send us off with a nice fuck. That's what women are for. If it's service you want, first go beat up those ''thirds." You just watch me. Okay, guys. Time to head out. You just watch! I win! That cleans me out. You got any spare cash? Let's go! You thieving Jap bastards! Come on! Get the hell out of there! Don't make a sound! - Madame, what's happening? - Just stay calm! Yakuzas fighting again. They're pathetic! Chieko? Chieko! Go on, answer her. - Did you lock the front door? - Yes. Go and check. It's burning! Here, take this. Go on, take it. Cease firing immediately! Shit! Stash this. I'll be back for it someday. Shit! You guys are bad, you know? Fucking thieves! Shut the fuck up, you chink! Who you calling thieves! You fucking ''thirds" suck up to the Yankees. You know, you guys lost the war, so that makes you ''fourths", right? Shut the fuck up! The Japanese Empire didn't lose to you bastards! We lost to the goddamn Americans! Who's the leader of you Japanese? I am. Me, too. Both of you, out! Hang the motherfuckers! Keep your mouths shut! Get inside! Well, well. Sit down. Sit yourselves down. Try one? it's good. The thing is, those ''thirds" were giving us a real hard time. But, thanks to you, we were able to arrest them. Now they'll get four or five years for illegal gambling. So now, what do we do about you? Unfortunately, the police are shorthanded these days, and prisoners are constantly escaping. What's this world coming to? What are you waiting for? Don't let this give you any ideas, now. Thank you so much! They're back. A prison breakout. For once we got a good cop. What happened? We made our case. If you're escaping, let us go, too! Asshole! You'll be eating prison slop for 10 years! We Japanese stick together! We're taking over your territory. We'll take your money, too. Come on, drink up. We served time together in that juvenile prison in Hokkaido, and here we are, taking over turf in Tokyo. Now that's something. Let's dance. Leave us alone, bitch! Listen, brother... don't waste your time with that moldy, outdated Kawada gang. Come join our gang and we'll have a good time. You'll be a boss in no time. Back in the slammer together, you always said you were like a balloon. You didn't want to wind up just any old punk. You wanted to be a boss. That you'd wind up running the whole damned country in the end. Now's your chance. You don't owe that Kawada nothing. Start your own Ishikawa gang. Be your own boss. And ''hubba hubba, let's go!" Isn't that right? Are you listening to me? Yeah, I'm listening. Come on, dance! Who's there? It's me. Hey there. Don't come in! They're asleep. She yell at you? I won't hurt you. This is all for you. I'm not gonna hurt you! No, don't! I said I wouldn't hurt you. I'll be back. Loan me this till then, okay? He's a man with spirit! A man among men, Kisaburo Nozu. He'll fight with his life to build a peaceful Japan. KISABURO NOZU BOSS OF THE NOZU FAMILY The respected godfather of the Nozu gang. In the first post-war elections, in a spirit of democracy ''banzai," a motley crew of candidates threw their hats into the ring. Under the slogan, ''A Light from Shinjuku," Kisaburo Nozu, boss of the Shinjuku black markets, running for a seat in parliament, was a perfect example. Welcome, sir! - Good work, men. - Thank you, sir! He's worked so hard to rebuild Shinjuku. We can't let him lose. Your popularity's fantastic. You're bound to win. Let's drink to that! We toast your inevitable victory! His victory's assured! Welcome, gentlemen. Go inside. Those assholes still sticking around here? Hadn't seen 'em in a while. Yours for the grabbing. Hey. She a new broad? Yes, that man brought her here from Ikebukuro. What the hell are you doing? Stop it! Sir, please stop! What the fuck is this? Take her back to Ikebukuro. She don't fit in Shinjuku. Step outside, you asshole! Who the fuck are you? Sir! Are you all right? I must apologize for the behavior of our young hotheads. How is the wounded man? NOBORU NEMOTO, ELDER, IKEBUKURO SHINWA CLAN I hope you will accept our godfather's condolences. Any message to pass on? We're screwed. Round up the men. Boss. The thing is... I did it for the gang. For the gang? Couldn't have those Ikebukuro guys strutting around on our Shinjuku territory, acting like they owned the place. I thought I'd clean things up. You fool! That wasn't cleaning things up. That was smashing the damned place to pieces! But it's our territory. - We can't let them muscle in. - You moron! I'm not interested in the shoe shine business! Leave 'em be. Ignore 'em. You have any idea how much a gang war costs? Can't you even calculate the consequences! Idiot! Now keep out of trouble! Listen up! We don't make a move until they attack. Okay? Let's go! A LIGHT FROM SHINJUKU You keep watch here. Both gangs have marshaled their soldiers. They're facing off near the station! All-out war, huh? You bet. God, you're an idiot! What the hell are you gonna do? A LIGHT FROM SHINJUKU We offered them a formal apology, but they rejected it. But we don't want to spoil your chances for election. Isn't there some way...? Our families are linked, so I can't mediate. They'd never agree. Isn't there someone else you could ask to mediate? I very much doubt it. It's just an excuse. They really want to muscle in on Shinjuku. Hello? Oh, yes, yes, how have you been? Yes, we appreciate your vote. I know. Let's bring in the Americans. Kawada, you have links to Colonel Parker, don't you? Throw money his way. I get it. Even the Shinwa clan has to obey American orders. An amazing plan. It never occurred to me to use the Americans. Fall back. Come on, let's go. Ishikawa! You've cost the gang over a million yen with this thing! From now on, you think of the gang before you make a move! Got that! And you, eat what's bought for you! Sorry. You can thank me for kicking them out of our territory. He's got a lot of nerve! He thinks he's pulled off some feat! I've had enough of him! IN THE ELECTIONS, HELD ONE MONTH LATER, NOZU LOST BY 5,000 VOTES. Place your bets. In play. Five. You lost again. Don't touch me! you're bad luck! - Your luck's bound to change. - You think? Bets, please. In play. One. That politician is my guest. Can you loan him three? Certainly, sir. Here you are. Loan me three, will ya? Sit this one out. Lady luck's not with you. What? You just gave him three big ones. But none for me? You trying to pull rank in your own gang? You're just going berserk! Why, you -- Riki! Sir. I hear you've been crawling out of gambling joints these days. What you're doing is rubbing mud in your godfather's face. You'll never be a real man if you can't look after your own. Take this. Come again. How dare he preach to me. That's Boss Nozu's car! Bastard! You're a disgrace to me and our family! Don't run! Get out here and take your medicine! How dare you glare at your own boss like that, you asshole! Fucking fool! That's enough, boss. I'll talk some sense into him. Get out and don't come back without your finger cut off! Look after him. Are you okay? Stop moving around like that. Give me a knife, a blade, anything! I've got to cut my finger off to get respect. Hey, hey, you can do that anytime. Just take a drink. Didn't I tell you to leave them and come join up with me? It's still not too late. Well? Come on, drink up, man! KAWADA ORGANIZATION OFFICES OCTOBER 28, 1946 Open up! Open up or I'll break the door down! Riki! I wanna see the godfather! I've got something to tell him! He takes all our money! How dare you say that? But, boss, he's drunk. Shut up! You filthy bastard! Go and cool off your head, and then come back! Bastard! I'll cut you to pieces! You damned ingrate! You stabbed me, you bastard! Get him! Boss! Don't let him get away! Get him! Get a doctor, quick! Get a pillow! Godfather! Open up. it's me! Come on! Please open up! Get me some booze. Please. Bring it now. I'm cold. I'm freezing. I'm so cold. I'm so cold. Help me! Several days later, Rikio Ishikawa gave himself up to the police. He was sentenced to 18 months in Fuchu Prison. But according to the yakuza code, attacking one's godfather is an unforgivable offense. He had pitted himself against the entire yakuza world. Not only members of the Kawada clan, but any yakuza, would gain in stature by killing him. Every man in the yakuza world was competing to end his life. Perhaps out of fear for his life, Rikio's behavior in prison became violent in the extreme. What's going on! As though adding insult to injury, an official document banned him from any Tokyo clan for the next 10 years. OCTOBER 1948 FUCHU PRISON I've got friends in Osaka. I'm not saying spend the whole 10 years there. Hang in there for a while and we'll try and get you back. You're feverish. You sick? I have to take off for Osaka tonight. I need money. My friend runs a geisha house. Would you go work there? What do you say? ONE YEAR LATER Almost no one knows of his doings during his year in Osaka. All that remains is a hospital chart showing Rikio Ishikawa had been treated there. TUBERCULOSIS SIX MONTHS LATER What do you think you're looking at? My bed's above yours. Then hurry up and get up there. Does dope make you feel that good? You don't know what it feels like? Silly boy. It's a whole lot better than sex. Shoot me up. You got money? It costs 200 yen. Jerk. Including my pussy, that's 400 yen. Great. I'll shoot it for you. You got any shit? - I got some. How much? - Gimme all you got. What? Gimme all you've got! KATSUJI OZAKI, UNEMPLOYED He said give him all you've got. IMAI ORGANIZATION OFFICES Place your bets. Here. Hey, boss! Ishikawa's out there gambling. Ishikawa? Last chance. Place your bets. I bet this. I bet my dope, too. Got a problem? Look, pal. Take your jokes elsewhere. Take yours back, too. The bet's been made. Just a minute. Hey, brother. What happened to you? Come on. Come with me. Listen, man, you're overdoing it, even by your standards. You were banished for 10 years. It's been just a little over a year. Look, we'll cover for you as best we can. But get back to Osaka before you're spotted. If Kawada's boys find you here, they'll want more than a finger or two. He's a totally different man. He's hardly deaf or dumb, but he refuses to say a word. Listen. He's obviously got himself a drug habit. That other weirdo is a total junkie. He looks like one. You watch. They'll be back. What if the Kawada gang finds out? You shouldn't have gotten involved. You can't have them paying you regular visits. Will you just shut up? He's a junkie, a lost cause. Welcome. Go back inside. He must be out of his mind. Don't these young punks respect the code anymore? Maybe we let him off too easy... by just banishing him. Will you let me take care of it? For now, have the boys keep an eye on him. Good evening. Hey, babe. What's wrong? It's just ... It's just so sudden. I got sick of Osaka. But is it safe for you to come back? Come on, honey. Getting to the point, Imai... you were about to make a laughing stock out of me. What? He means Riki. How long are you going to protect him? That's now how things are. We go way back and he just showed up. I didn't bring him back. I understand that. But you didn't show me respect by informing me. Among us elders, not showing respect violates the yakuza code. The thing is, having banished him, I don't really give a damn what happens to him. But he's got to serve out all ten years of his banishment. Then I'll let him off the hook. Surely you understand. I understand. Please allow me to take care of it. I hear the Kawada gang already know you're back in town. Sure, I'd like to cover for you. But now I've started my own clan and I'm a godfather myself. We all live by a code. There's just no way around the rules. Hey, enough about me. It's your welfare I'm thinking about. Just take my advice. Get out of Tokyo, like I've been telling you. If you don't like Osaka, we'll find someplace else. I know. How about a hot-spring resort town? The air'll do you good. You're falling to pieces, man. You wanna sell me out, go ahead. I never said that. Remember when we served time together, way back? You swore to stand by me come hell or high water. That's why I'm trying to save you. Since when did you become so merciless? How dare you! In that case, listen to this. As my sworn brother, you came begging and cheating at my tables. Like a fucking tramp! I fucking spoiled you! Don't mock me! You dare cut me? Grab the gun! Please don't die! IMAI ORGANIZATION OFFICES Despite the Imai gang's desperate searches, there was no sign anywhere of Ishikawa or Ozaki. And then, one week later... OCTOBER 8, 1949 Who's there? Where's Imai? Upstairs? Darling! The day after Imai's murder, the police discovered Ishikawa's hideout. Fifty officers soon surrounded the place. Hearing the news, the Imai and Kawada gangs also converged on the scene. A tense atmosphere pervaded the area. Ishikawa! This is Chief Inspector Imada. You're completely surrounded by the police. Stop resisting and come out quietly. Make it easy on yourself and surrender. Throw out the gun and come out. That motherfucker! He's fucking crazy! Quick, gimme bullets! That's all that's left. We're outta dope! Throw stones at him! No fucking dope! We've got no dope left! RIKIO ISHIKAWA ARRESTED OCTOBER 9, 1949 MAY 9, 1950 -- THE VERDICT The accused, Ishikawa, is sentenced to 10 years' hard labor. Ozaki is sentenced to two years. Their respective terms are inclusive of the 100 days already served. The police confiscated one pistol and three bullets related to the incident. This is my judgment this ninth day of May 1950. Immediately after receiving his 10-year sentence, Ishikawa filed an appeal with the Tokyo high court. Chieko, despite her ill health, worked incessantly to raise bail for Ishikawa. IMAI ORGANIZATION OFFICES Madam... I'd like to pay my respects. Not a chance in hell! You of all people should know that! Thank you. JANUARY 20, 1951 HUSBAND: RIKIO WIFE: CHIEKO Ten days before Chieko's suicide, Ishikawa had registered her as his lawful wife. We have no way of knowing whether this was her wish or Ishikawa's. YOSHIDA GRAVESTONES Make a gravestone and carve this on it. A grave for three? Please. I'll bring the rest later. I promise. Riki, how long are you gonna just sit there? The boss has made a real exception for you. Whatever you've got to say, say it. Are you trying to fuck with us? Godfather... I've caused you a lot of trouble. I want to start my own family. Your own clan? You've got balls! Can't you give me some land? That vacant block down in 2-chome. Sure, sure, it's yours. And then, I'll need a building... I'll need offices, too, so I need 20 million yen. I need 20 million. Are you fucking crazy? I'll be back. Welcome. Open it. Are you crazy? Open the box! No, don't! Ishikawa, stop it! We're all in the same gang. No need to wave that thing in his face. You want dope, right? He's got good shit. Break it out, quick! What's so funny? Nothing really. Be quiet. I can't concentrate. Now! Out of my way! That's enough! Let's go! Even this failed to kill this man, seemingly fated to life. Miraculously surviving by dint of his incredible life force, his appeal was rejected in August 1951, and he was returned to Fuchu prison. Six years later... FEBRUARY 2, 1956 Stop! Get down! Come down now! WHAT A LAUGH! THIRTY YEARS OF MADNESS! KOZABURO IMAI AND RIKIO ISHIKAWA As the prototype of the post-war yakuza, his name still lives on in legend today. Yet what spirit drove him to carve ''humanity and justice" on his grave... to this day no one knows, and no one ever will. THE END
