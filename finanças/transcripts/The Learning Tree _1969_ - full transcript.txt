you signed up for a college preparatory course that's right I plan on going to college are you serious yes well let me tell you something very few Negro students go to college they just aren't college material and the few who do go wind up as cooks and porters in any case now I just think that's an awful waste of money and time that's not gonna happen to me whether I go to college or not now Newton

same way mr. McClintock happens to be your instructor as well as your guidance teacher I just don't like the way she wants to guide me and that caused you to tell her you hated him well I didn't say why you know you said it I didn't say I hated you alone I said all the colored kids hate you and we do why do you say such a thing she's always telling us the same thing don't go to college you're just gonna be porters and maids is this true miss McClintock do you tell the Negro students such things mr. Hall I have been class adviser here for over 20 years I tell them what I was instructed to tell them who who instructed you mr. Hornsby the principal before you oh I see I see miss McClintock well that will be all I would like to talk to you don't you sit over here to explain miss McClintock one would have to go back to a tragic time before either you or I was born and although she must share the blame for this awful wrong miss McClintock is someone a victim herself she thought it was right because it was a situation that existed for so long mr. Hornsby is more to blame than she but then so was his father and my father and millions of others there's still things at this school that I don't like new the fact that you boys can't play on the football and basketball teams that you can't attend the school dances and parties were left up to me and a few others who care all this would stop but there are still too many mr. Hornsby's left or her well maybe someday you can go now Newton I intend to have a long talk with some aclinic and a few of the other teachers when we when the Board meets next I'm sure that their attitudes and thinking they'll be different Oh Newton you were to show miss McClintock the highest respect hello nude Jabby where's our Sela oh I thought she'd be home by now I had to stay we had to
