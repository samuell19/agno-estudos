Terrorists. Begin. - I was there maybe an hour. - Allahu akbar! (EXPLOSION) - Wait. Begin with... how you came to my country. - Look, I'm a grad school TA on a fellowship program from Cornell University... Cornell. The Ivy League? In America? Here to do a panel on fucking Southeast Asian art history. - A teaching assistant? - Yeah. - Do you... Lecture to your students with that language? - You should hear what they call me. - Lanjutkan. Continue. - I flew in last week. Then they invited me to this... party. They said formal. I didn't realize it was, like, Hawaiian shirt night. - Batik. It's called batik. - Right. - Did you speak with anyone? - I don't know anyone here. (VCR WHIRRING) I hit on a pretty girl. So? - Our... Princess Diana. You were the last to speak to the sultana of Java before she died. Now... you will tell me every detail. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - Wow. Those are beautiful. - Excuse me? - The diamonds...

Was... the most revered woman in my country. You may go. Just fill out this witness report. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) (IN INDONESIAN) The bule never asked for his embassy. - I know. - No bule would do that. - A bule who knows about our crown jewels but doesn't know to wear batik to our formal events. - He's lying. - I know. - You're keeping the general waiting. - Yeah, I know. (CROWD SHOUTING) (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) General, Sir. - English. Where have you been? - Sorry, pak, but every witness must be thoroughly... - My men tell me that there are a dozen links between this bombing and the Malaysian fanatic Faruq Al'Assan. - Faruq is far too politically sophisticated for this. - I need someone to string up for the media.

(CUFFS CLICK) (SIGHS) "Bule"? (WHISPERS) Shit. - Literally, "stupid white person," but it can be a term of endearment. - Yeah, right. - The bomber stood here, yes? - Um... - Think, Mr. Wilde. - Yeah. He stood there. - And the sultana? She was here? - Yeah, but... - But you couldn't see because of the screen. - Yeah. - And you? You were here? - No, I was... I was here. - You had a clear view of the bomber. What did you see? - He held his hands up and then shouted... - Mr. Wilde, Allah gave you two eyes and one mouth so that you might see twice as much as you speak. So please, what did you see? - I told you. I heard him scream, and then he blew the whole... - No. What did you see? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - His hands were empty. Someone else detonated the bomb. How did I miss that? - No doubt not part of your training in Southeast Asian studies. - Art history. - Yes. - Who was this? - The sultana. - This is where you found the sultana? - Indeed. Odd that her body was blown toward the explosion. One more stop. (SOFTLY) The prettiest girl at the party. - Do you want to become a permanent guest here? Perhaps... it is less painful for you to wait outside, Pak Vizier. Did you know... It's a grave sin in Islam to mark one's own flesh? - And what's the Koran say about a woman piercing her clit? - Excuse me? (CLEARS THROAT) I see. - She's also had a nose job. Implants. This isn't the sultana. - How can you know that? - Trust me. I know women. - Yes. You know beauty. - I met the lady. - It's time for us to leave. (IN ARABIC) Peace be with you. - And to you.

Interpol shows your fingerprints at bomb sites in Baghdad, Kabul, and Beirut. - I've been tracking this terror cell for the last two years. I'm close, Hash, real close. - And no one at your FBI informed our agencies here? - They didn't trust you people. - Because we are Muslim? - Because when we talk to you, we're not sure who we're talking to. - Indeed. - And because we're not allowed to operate outside U.S. soil. That's why you can't tell the embassy, or it'll ruin two years of work. - Nor can I check your story. - Look, Hash, this is my case. - And this is my country. And what I should do now is elevate you from bad witness to good suspect. - Are you crazy? - The general is a nationalist. If he learns we've involved an American, a spy... - Jesus and Mary protect us. - God willing.
