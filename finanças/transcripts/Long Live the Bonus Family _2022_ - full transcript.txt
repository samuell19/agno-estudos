THE MOUNTAIN LODGE - Should I drive you to the station? - Coffee first. - We have to go within an hour. - Sure. - Good. - Yes, it's in place. - That's why you love it. - No, that's not it. - If you were honest? - Oh, dear. Darling, it's something with peanut and a heart. Well... - Hey, this is going to the spa. - Okay. - Hi, sweetie. - Hi. Where's the wrapping paper? - Have you checked the green cupboard? - Eh, yes. - It could go up a bit, 10 cm. - What? Hello? - Sorry, I'm in the middle of... - It's candlesticks and Trivial Pursuit. - Can you wait for a couple of hours? - No, I need it now. It's mini Christmas at Grandma's. Sweetie, I'm working now. Commanding, right? Then I can wear it like this. - Yes, bring the collar up. - Let's see. - We've got this one too. - Wow! Nice. Yes. It's 6,995 SEK. 6,995? Yes, thanks. Wow! - 6,995, is that what she said? - Yes, she did. It's nice. - Who negotiates your salary? - Nobody, sadly. But Lisa deserves something very nice after this crappy year. Look! Of course, but you can't buy your way out of it. You did something, and now you want to compensate. Do something that is demanding, give her a sacrifice. A sacrifice? Should I cut my dick off, wrap it and give it to her? Great. Put it in the bag, wrapped in paper. Then you can't cheat, right? That's great! But a little sad for Lisa, maybe. A bit sad for me too. What are you doing for Christmas? I don't know. That girl you were dating, shouldn't you two be doing something? LINDA: JENS, ARE YOU DUMB? IT'S OVER. No! What an asshole! You can't write that the day before Christmas Eve. You deserve someone better. How much fun is it to be with someone who got burnt out? Fun? You deserve someone who loves you as you are. Someone who loves you even though you feel a bit "meh" and are burnt out. - You deserve a Patrik! - Yes, but he's spoken for. - Could we have two more beers? - Sure. - So, you're staying over Christmas? - No, we're on our way now. - But the Stockholm train is going now. - No...? Shit! - Maybe we can make the change in Mora? - Smart. LONG LIVE THE BONUS FAMILY - Hi, baby. - Hi! Sorry I'm late. You're not late, it's perfect timing. - She's really cute! - She's 17 years old. Seventeen, what? - She's not a lot older than me. - Love doesn't have an age. - I don't have gifts with me. - We're doing mini Christmas. So embarrassing. Were we not having coffee? That's pedophilia in action. Do you think that's okay? Of course not, but there are so many prejudices about age and sex. It's illegal to sleep with people under 15 so that old folks... - Oh, so we old folks can't sleep around? - Sleep around? Let me tell you that sex is best after 60. - I'm eating! - Nice topic of conversation. This is my family. This is Danny and Bigge Kardashian. Hi! - And you've met Eddie Osbourne. - Hi, Eddie! - Have a seat. - Who is Eddie Osbourne? Hi. What are you doing? We're baking insanely nice gingerbread for you. - Is that Mom? - Are you on the train now? There's a lot of work on the railway, so we'll be delayed. - What? What's happened? - The damn train company. Do you know how long it will take? We're changing trains in Mora at 2:43 p.m. - I'll be home around 6 or 7 p.m. - Yeah, great. - I love you. - Kisses. - So you're on the train? - Yes, soon. I don't know about that. We'll never make it to Mora for 2:43 p.m. - What? - No, not a chance. What the hell? WILLIAM, EDDIE, LISA, PATRIK, LO AND BUSTER LIVE HERE Hello! I'm home! Come! Come and hug... - She's just fallen asleep. - Oh, no! That's typical. - Hi. - Hi! Damn! Was there a wine tasting on the train? - Hi. - Welcome. Come. Wow, wow, wow! Darling, you've made it really cozy! Shit! No, no, no! I forgot all the Christmas presents on the train! - No! - Hey, it's fine. It's fine. The big Christmas present is that you're home. Wow. Shit, you've made this so beautiful, darling. - Is this a date night? - Maybe a sleeping late kind of night. Hello? Hi! Merry Christmas! I've missed you, sweetie. - It's from Grandma. - She didn't need to do that. - That's nice. - It's not for you, it's for Mom. Sure. - This, can I just eat? - Yeah, go for it. So sweet. - Dad says hello. - Was his new girlfriend there? What are they doing tomorrow? Can't they come here for coffee? I want to meet her. - Not on Christmas Eve. - Okay, but Christmas Day or Boxing Day? It would be nice. A quick coffee. Maybe an hour? It's never a quick coffee with this group. It could be. You don't have to offer lots of things. I've bought the right amount of food for our family. And I haven't seen you for a long time. I want to hang out with the family. So, please, let's not invite them. - Have you seen the Louisiana poster? - No. - It was hanging here this morning. - I don't know. But what about New Year's? We're going to Filip's. I was going to have a party if that's okay. - No. - What? I live here too. - I can have a party, right? - Yes, when you move out. When I move out? Go to hell! Please! You're 17. I know what parties are like at that age. Darling... I have to work on New Year's Eve. - What? With what? - We didn't quite finish. The guest house opens after the holidays, so we have to finish. It's just a few days, then I'll be home. I was so pleased it was over and that you'd be home. Right now, I'm home. Let's have some good food. MERRY CHRISTMAS, DARLING. FROM ME YOU'RE GETTING... The mail shouldn't be here. Hello, sweethearts. Wow, have you brought out candy? They're ours! Donald Duck is on soon. What's up with you? What do you want for Christmas? A long screw or some morning filth? Wow. Maybe both? - Have you been that nice? - I really think I have. Isn't a Christmas present something you wrap? Fine, I won't bother. STOCKHOLM COUNTY COURT No, let's do the long screwing. Sign. - Are you coming? - Yes, we're just finishing up. - What the hell is this? - What? THE COURT ORDERS THAT THE DIVORCE IS IN FORCE FROM DECEMBER 17 - Wow. - Wow? - We're divorced, damn it. - Shit, I forgot. You forgot? You forgot? You didn't forget. You signed it and sent it in. That was when you were seeing Elin again. - Again? - You were seeing Elin again. Then I panicked. - What the hell have you done? - What have you done? What? What was I supposed to think? Eddie saw you make out in town. He was mistaken. We were just talking. I should have told you that I bumped into her. - Yes, you should have. - I didn't want to worry you unnecessarily. And it was good that we got closure. - "Closure"? - Yes. You know what divorce is like. If you don't talk, it goes to hell. There's a hell of a difference: we have kids with our exes. We have to be in touch. - You make it sound like you were a couple. - No, we weren't. We were. She was kind of a friend that I still cared about. - I felt that I had an obligation. - Didn't you care about my feelings? Of course I care about you, and I understand that you reacted. But I... It just disappeared into everything. The thing with Elin just disgusted me. I know. I don't think you understand what it feels like. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey. Should we get married now? - Now? - Yes, as soon as possible. Between Christmas and New Year's. I think city hall is open. - Don't you want to? - Yes, of course I do. But in that case because we're choosing each other again, not because of a technicality. - Great, we'll renew our vows. - Yes, in the summer in that case. No, I want to be married to you now. Not being married to you makes me feel physically sick. The whole family is... - divided. - But I want... I want... - Let's do it properly, not quickly. - We can do it properly and quickly. - I love you. I'm... - You too. I... We... We should... Darling, let's not plan a wedding now. There's too much going on. - I've worked myself to the bone. - Come on, Mom! I love you too. Come in! It's open! Don't be so shy. Hi! Come in! Great to see you! Have you changed your mind? - No, I have to talk to you. - Absolutely. - Have people started arriving? - Yes. Great to see you! How have you been? - Did you get any nice Christmas presents? - Well, I got a divorce from Lisa. - Are you joking? - No. We're still together, but she sent the forms in a few weeks ago. - So now we're divorced. - Damn, that's quite a thing! - How are you feeling? - Like shit. I get it. Hang around. Have some dim sum. - I don't have time. - Is it such a bad thing after all? You're meeting outside of the shackles of marriage. I want to be married. This is Patrik. I want to be married to her. Every second without her makes me anxious. - What's the difference? You live together. - What we have is greater than that. I didn't understand that until I was about to lose her. - I'm about to lose her again. - Get married again. - The church has drop-in ceremonies. - She doesn't want to. She wants a big party for everybody. The whole extended family. Get everybody together, then. Get everybody there for New Year's Eve. Surprise! Romance. You can do it. - You're no fool. - Fool? No. - Everybody's coming. - I'm hanging out with my pals. Katja, Grandma, your dad. It'll be awesome. - Is Dad coming? - I haven't spoken to him yet. - But I'll talk to everybody now. - Okay, good luck. It's not that stormy anymore. We have a good relationship now. Absolutely not. It's New Year's Eve. We're going to Sturehof. That's not going anywhere. You only get married once. Or twice. Or three or four times. How many times do you have time for with the same woman? I'd appreciate it if you came up. There are nice ski slopes, snowmobiles and a spa. We have the whole place to ourselves. - Wow, it sounds really cool. - Did you become a millionaire? No, but Lisa knows the owners, so we can be there for free. - I'm going to a New Year's party. - They can come up too. - How many rooms do you have? 50? - So funny. - Some homemade gl√ºhwein? - No, thanks. - That tone is so unnecessary. - I sound the same as always, right? The mountains? I'm not sure. We'll think about it. Eddie was positive, and your mom and her? What is he? - Gay friend, Danny. - Yes. - Bring Josef. We'll treat you. - Yes, but... ouch! Damn it! Josef is in Malm√∂ with Sima. Okay. What about your new girlfriend? Bring her. There's plenty of space at the guest house. We have some things planned. We'll give it some thought. Okay, but think about it. It's a surprise, don't say anything. - I get it, I'm not stupid. - I know. Bye. - No! - You're throwing candy at me! Damn... Shut up. - What have we got planned? - Nothing. - You said we had things planned. - I don't want to hang out with that dork. Stop it! He sounds really kind. A New Year's party would be fun, right? - Patrik! - Hi! Hello! - Happy holidays! - You too! Do you have Christmas off, or do you go through people's unhappy childhoods? - We've closed our practice. - Oh? Sorry to hear that. - I can suggest other therapists. - No, no need. We're actually great now. We're even getting remarried. - Did you get divorced? - Yes, no. Or yes... Lisa did. You know what she's like. She messes stuff up. - Did she mess up? - No, no! It's... It's mostly a technicality. It's paperwork. We... We're having a massive party in the mountains to celebrate renewing our vows. - Everybody's coming. It'll be great. - That sounds fun. Yes. But the kids want tacos at home. I have to... - Bye! - Bye... Great to hear you and Lisa sorted things out. Yes, it feels good. It feels great. - What about you and Ylva? Are you okay? - I have cancer. - And we're getting divorced. - Oh, my God... - Other than that, I'm fine. - I'm sorry. I didn't know. You have to make the most of your time. Enjoy the little things. It feels a bit lonely, but it's okay. You're welcome to join us in the mountains. What? I'd love to. - You would? - Yes, if it's no trouble. No, it's not. It would be wonderful to have you there. You've been there on this whole messy relationship journey. If you're there to celebrate love, that would feel great. You can marry us! - No, I don't want to do that. - Oh. I don't want any duties. I've got enough with looking after myself. - Being myself. - Okay. Great. You can be Jan. Hi! What's up? Where are you going? I bought candy. We can watch a Christmas movie. Maybe Die Hard. - No, I'll skip that. Thanks. - Hey, Eddie... - I was thinking of that party. - What about it? You can have it. You come home the day after the wedding and you have a parent-free party. I'll buy the food and drink and book your train ticket. It'll be a rad New Year's Day party. Nice, right? - Okay. How many can I invite? - Fifteen. - That's not a party. - Okay, 20, then. - Thirty. - Thirty? It's kind of like... A few more, we can think about it. But around that number. Come on! Please. - Fuck it. Okay! - You're the best, Eddie. Hello? No, no, no! Hello? What's happening? Lisa! - Shit! Are you okay? - I thought you were dying! Yes, but I was pulled in by her! What the hell have you done? It's wet everywhere. - All the way to the stairs. - Relax, darling. - My God! How many liters is this? - I'll help with that later. We can't do this later! I have to dry all of this now. - We might have to pull the floor up! - I'll happily pull the floor up, then. You can't just pull the floor up. Are you a celebrity engineer? Please, darling. Can we just finish our bath? - In peace and quiet? - Lo. Lo, are you getting out? You've finished your bath, you crazy little kid. Hey, I know the kids love bathing with you. Maybe that's worth the water damage. Sorry if I was a bit... - Cranky. - Yes. I'm sorry. - For real, I'm sorry. - Thank you. - Are you in pain? - A bit. - I'm sorry. - I'm alright. I might need a new femur head. And a few titanium screws. Hey... - if we get married again... - If? When we get married again... ...shouldn't we do it when we have a bit more money to make sure we have cash and can treat everyone to a nice trip or something? A great idea. Great. WE'RE DEPARTING FROM... WE'RE ALMOST HALFWAY. - Did you know that Jan has cancer? - Yes, I know. Yes, it's horrible, it's awful. JENS: SO EXCITED! PATRIK: - What are you up to? - It's just a friend. You're so bad at lying, Jens! She just wants validation, then she'll dump you. - Yeah, I'll block her. - Good, do that. Have you thought of a poem for your speech? - Yes, Morning by Karin Boye. - Morning? - Light, hopeful. - But Boye took her own life. - It's weird to use her poem at a wedding. - Did she kill herself? - Do you do it in the summer? - Oh, it's something you do? - Doing the dishes! - Yes! Welcome to the Mountain Lodge! We're not quite done, so we'll split the rooms to the best of our ability. - Excuse me! Can I bag a double room? - We have five double rooms. Maybe your children can share and you can take a single room? Yes, it... Wow! Okay, she's 20 minutes away now. Dump your things in your rooms damn quick, and we'll meet out there shortly. - Did you not block her? - Yes, but I'm texting a friend now. - No. - I'm charging! Give it to me. - What are you doing? - Helping you! - Patrik? - Just give it to me. Somebody's coming now! Look! There's a yellow car! - Down on one knee. - No! Yes, otherwise it's not for real. Just do it. - Is that them? - I think so. - Are you ready with the champagne? - Why have they stopped? Somebody must have snitched. Are you okay? You're scaring her off. Down again. Down, damn it! We have balloons! PATRIK HEARTS LISA = TRUE Oh, shit! What's going on here? My beloved best person on this earth, would you marry me again? My God. Hi, everybody. Balloons and bubbly... Sorry, I'm just so shocked. I'm a bit... Of course I do. Of course. - I love you. - Put it on. You put it on. Wow! - Cheers! - Cheers! What a surprise, hey? - Thanks. - Congratulations. Again. Hi! Thank you! - Is everything feeling okay? - Yes, absolutely. Of course. It just went a bit quickly. - The divorce went a bit quickly too. - Yes, it did. I really tried to get everybody here, but... No, this is really nice, darling! It's great. Come and cuddle with me. Darling! What is it? Don't you want to? - You don't want to get married, do you? - Yes, of course I do. - Was that why you stayed in the car? - No, no. If you want to delay it, we can do it later. And we'll just hang out here with the family. Something has happened, and you should know it before you choose me again. - Come. - It feels important. Come here, darling. Ouch... You know what? I've chosen you. I will always choose you. Whatever happened... I love you. I had sex with another dude up here. It happened once and it didn't mean anything. No, nothing. Darling... When? That weekend when Eddie had seen you and Elin together. And he'd seen you. That's five weeks ago. It's so recent. Yeah, I guess it's five weeks ago, then. You're pissed with me when I do something like this, then you do the same thing. Maybe that was it. It felt good that it was 1-1. It evened out. - 1-1? - In my head, we broke up for a few days. Before we sorted everything out. Okay? It was... it became even. In my head. Who is it? - It doesn't matter. - What's his name? - Nobody you know. - Did you fuck in this bed? In this room? - No. - Say his name. I don't know his name. I didn't check his wallet. - What if I run into him? - You won't. You don't know him. I didn't ask what his name was. It was a random dude. Shit... Have I broken everything now or what? 1-1. What sort of a thing is that to say? Like it's a fucking match. And she's kept quiet about this for a month. She should have told me. Isn't that exactly what you did? At least she's telling you now. She could have kept quiet. We just got out on the other side. How should I get over this? It could be anyone. It could be him. - Yes. - It could be him. Or those two bastards. Cut it out! You're alive. Our friend got a horrible death sentence. I know. He's spending his last New Year's Eve here. With you, to celebrate love. Lisa's little thing is incidental. If you spend the rest of your lives together, - you'll laugh about this in ten years. - No. - Yes, you will. Trust me. - I won't. - Hi. How are you doing? - Well, they haven't changed this. - I'll have to move things around. - I think that will look good. - Do you think so? - Yes. Or we wait... I told Patrik. - Oh, shit. - It feels weird not to say anything. And he wanted to know who it was. Okay. - I didn't say anything. - Hello! Ping-pong. Are you up for it? - You go ahead. I'll get started on this. - Are you sure? Nice one. - Are you doing butt or king? - What are you worst at? - Jens, you have a dot. - What? It's two dots. Sit down! - I was the king in school. - A lot of talk, no action. You should know that I'm not scared of talking about it. Most people are petrified. As soon as you say "cancer," they run in the opposite direction. - Ylva, for instance. - Not me. Somehow it actually feels easier to talk to men, strangely enough. Aren't men good, though? People just moan about men all the time. That they splay their legs. I love that they splay their legs! And I like that they explain things to me. - I'm the king. I can decide. - The king always serves. - Serve! You're meant to serve. - Are you with me? - I'm here. What are you waiting for? Go! - What? Go again! I don't get it. What does Lisa see in him? He is a dork. Right? Yes, he is, you know that. You can tell. Oh, my God! Well... She should have said no when he proposed. A lot of shit under the bridge. With the infidelity. But you know about that. Lisa tells me everything. - What? Has Lisa told you? - Yes. - What? Are you nervous? What's up? - No, I thought... no. Okay... - Have you and Lisa? - No. No. I thought... - I can see that you're lying! - No. - I mean, does Patrik know about this? - Please... - "Please"? - You can't. Good ball! - Yes, Patrik speaking. - Hi, I'm the wedding officiant. The fucking assistant, is that you? Is that a part of your job? Hey? So nice of you to help us on such short notice. That's fine. But I thought... Did you want to be married exactly at midnight? If you do, we should start earlier. Yes, exactly. We're on standby here. Great. I'll be there in plenty of time tomorrow. Hey, would you know about a love poem for if you've had a difficult time? Arguments and fights and so on? Well, I suppose love poems should be a bit loving. - I've probably heard mostly happy ones. - Yes, absolutely. It was a long shot. It's still a bit ironic. When you're young, you're too insecure to try something new. When you're old and don't give a shit about what people think, you don't have the energy. Find a hobby that doesn't require a lot of effort. Tantric sex? Lie still for six hours without orgasming? Is that tantric sex? Okay... I've tried that for 40 years with Ylva. Once there was a guy in high school... He looked good. A Paul Newman type. I was actually a bit attracted to him. I think it was mutual. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I'd gone for it. - But you never tried? - No. - It's never too late. - Yes, it is. No, stop it. For real, we have to do something about this. It's important. No, it... The worst thing I can imagine is to die while curious. I'll survive. No, I won't, but you know what I mean. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm fine. I can tell something is wrong, Lisa. You never smoke when you're happy. I just wish that Patrik and I would have had the time to talk things through before getting married. I understand. Men aren't particularly good at understanding us women, you could say. I don't know what Patrik is like. Biggen, I don't really feel like talking. - No. - I'll be right in. See you in there. See you at the bar! Darling, I don't think you've redeemed all of your Christmas present yet. I'm sorry, I... I'm not quite there. That's fine. Was it the guy from Dalarna? Totte? No, it wasn't Totte. We're friends. - He's not ugly. - No, but we're just friends. He is totally in love with his girlfriend who is working at the railway hotel. I'm sorry, I just get so damn... I think I understand how you've been feeling. And how does that feel? It feels... Of course it feels really fucking hard. If you were able to deal with my infidelity, I have to deal with yours. I want to live with you for the rest of my life. This will just have to be a blip. A fucking difficult blip, but still. Sorry that it got so corny when I went down on one knee. - Signs and crap. - It was lovely. I love you so incredibly much. I wonder if you... - still want to marry me? - Yes, of course. Of course I do, darling. It feels like you do fancy your Christmas present. Right? There's just evening filth left on the list. - Hi. - Hi. - Congratulations on your wedding day. - Thanks. Congratulations to you too. You know what? I have a surprise for you. Oh? Wow... We're going out for an excursion for a few hours. Eddie is looking after the kids. - Exciting! - I know. But I have bits and pieces to sort out for dinner. - We have to... you're working, aren't you? - Darling, you'll have the time. Totte gave me time off. I can continue tomorrow. - I need to talk to you. - Okay. - Do you know Lisa's little secret? - Yes. Good. I need help with cooking. She's kidnapping me, so I won't have time to cook dinner. - Could you supervise? Be the boss? - Yes, sure. - Food, setting the table... - No problem. Here's the recipe and checklist, table setting and seating plan. - Does that feel okay? - Yes, that's cool. Hey! Lisa is kidnapping me today. - Finally! - Quiet! But Jens is stepping up to supervise the cooking and setting of the tables. - He might need some help. - Yes. - Does anybody want to help? - I'm in! - Absolutely. - This is great! You have free time until dinner. At midnight we'll get married, and after that, the party starts! - Yes, this feels great! - Yes. Let's sit down with that later. - Patrik! - Yes? I won't butt in, but I know that you and Lisa have had a difficult year. It's fine now. It can go really wrong if the man doesn't know what to do. I know what to do. Listen to me. It's about down there. It's not just a button. It's not a machine. It's like a little being that lives down there. - Okay, I'll keep that in mind. - Okay. - It was just a tip. - Yes. Think "the ice cream is melting." THE MOUNTAIN LODGE What the hell is she doing? This thing with Jens is disgusting. - What the hell? Are you a psychologist? - No. - What kind of... - Good. - Never mind! - What the hell? There. And the chairs around it. Hey! The spotlights are here now and some other stuff. - Could you look after that? - Both of you can't take the day off. - But Patrik, the groom, asked me to help. - Somebody else can do that. There's others in your group, right? We'll open on the fifth. - We'll take care of this. - Sure? I was a party organizer in my past life. Perfect, this is everything that needs to be done. And I'm in the vicinity. It's fine. - How far away is it? - An hour away. But it's so worth it. - Hello! - Hi! How did Christmas Eve work out? You drank and lost the presents and missed your train. That was exciting, right? That was fine in the end. The bag with the presents is behind the bar. Come by. - I'll buy you a drink. - Great! - Aside from that? - Well, we're going somewhere. We're just filling up and then we'll go. - See you. - Yeah, great. "Damn SJ" or what did you say? I was stressed about being late and didn't want you to get angry. Come on, you got pretty nice Christmas presents anyway, right? Come on, let's go. - Where are you going? - To the sauna. - Everybody has to help. - Did either of us volunteer? - Don't be silly, Martin! - Okay! Should we cook dinner? - We're guests! - We're family, Martin. - Families help each other. - Good, I'll know that for next time. Welcome to the party. Bring work clothes because you'll decorate and cook. Of course we'll help. It'll be fun. Some cooking! I had the highest grade in home economics. - Good. I'll show you the kitchen. - Could we get changed first? Should I fry meat in my swim trunks? No. Bloody hell! So nice. A little bit that way, there are some really cozy houses where you can stay the night. - A bit isolated, isn't it? - Yes... Perfect, if you want to shuffle off with a lovely bartender? No, stop it! I'm trying to tell you something. Okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead, tell me. - They're for sale. - Okay. - Not a weekend place? - I thought we'd try living here. - Actually, maybe live here. - Do you want to live here? Yes. Imagine if the kids get to grow up in this environment. Everything is so quiet and still here, and beautiful. Is there public water and electricity, and what do you do about transportation? My God! You think it's a shitty idea. As usual. No, it's not a bad idea. I love your crazy ideas. - It's not crazy! - It's cute, but... This is how we work: you're the gas, I'm the brakes. - Then we meet. - You're really braking. I'm sorry. How the hell did we end up here? Forced labor. - We'll solve it. - Is it going well? - Thanks so fucking much for this task. - Sorry, I have to work. - I'll help as soon as I can. - No, that won't work. We just got a little task. You have to take over. Molly, come on! You have to tell Patrik, otherwise I will. - Right? He's a human after all. - Yes. Hello? - Danny, Hello! Is everything alright? - Hi. - Yes, I think so. How about you? - So-so. - Jan has cancer. - I heard. - It's so awful, that disease. - Disgusting. I'm trying to support him as much as I can before he passes. That's very nice of you, actually. Something interesting: when he was young, guys turned him on. - Oh? I had no idea. - No... Then his life took a different turn and now he's got cancer. Then it might be time to kind of... A desire to try things he hasn't had the time for has been expressed. Do you mean that you want some tips about how it's done? Maybe not me. I thought if it would be... I thought of... Do you think I'd sleep with anyone just because I'm gay? No, I know you're picky. But because he is dying. He doesn't have a lot of time left. It's weeks or months. It would be really nice to give him a gift. - So, I'd be the gift? - Yes. So nice. I couldn't imagine a nicer gift. - For real, you're sick. - Stop it. - I just asked. - What the hell? - Stop it. - No, you stop it. Are you lost? I was just joking, but you don't know where we are? The thing is, there isn't usually this much snow. Do you know in which cardinal direction we are compared to the guest house? What? You must have looked at a map. Are we south, north or west? Which way are we going? It's like a triangle, and it normally doesn't look like this. - A triangle? - Exactly. Completely fucking unbelievable! Can I use your phone? I don't have a signal. My phone is dead. Were you out on the mountain without a charged phone? If you get lost on a mountain, Lisa, you can die. We won't die. - It's dangerous! - My God! Lo was playing with it. - Lo? - This wasn't planned. You can't blame Lo for your dead battery. Admit that you made a mistake rather than blaming someone else. My God! Relax. You forget Christmas presents, trains and divorces. You forget that you're working New Year's Eve and that you slept with someone. Can't you just fucking say it like it is for once? You want me to say that I'm the worst person in the world? I just want a bit of normal, fucking honesty. Why do you want to marry me if I'm so fucking bad?! Because I love you! Don't you get that?! You're stressing me out all the time, so I took a shortcut. - Get up and sit down so we can go. - Snow everywhere! - Come on! - We can do this. - Are you okay, Lo? - Yes. We should have had a Snowracer, not a sled board from the 1800s. Slide on your own butt, then. It's from the 1900s. What are you talking about? Can't we slide on one of those? We'll just pull it off. - Yes, you're a genius! - A damn good idea. There. Are you with me? That must be the ski slope. Check them out! What the hell? That's the kids! Please, just take it easy, Patrik. What the hell are you doing? Are you insane? That's so dangerous! - We're just sliding down the slope. Chill. - Somebody could have died! - No. - Calm down. Those mattresses are meant to be on the pylons for safety, not for sliding fast. Why are you picking on me? I haven't done anything but work on your damn party! - We're looking after your kids. - I'm grateful, of course. - Say thank you instead. - Thank you very much. - What are you laughing at? - I'm not laughing. What's so damn funny? Your wedding is a joke. - Excuse me? - Stop! Now is not the time. When is the time to say it like it is? - What are you talking about? - That's what happens, I guess... When you meet each other through a lie. A karma boomerang hits you in the head. You two deserve each other! - Sweetie, are you cold? - No. - Have you said anything? - Of course not. - Hi. - Hi. - Can I come in? - Yes, sure. Yes, have a seat. We've talked about these... ...things, and I... don't want you to die curious. Right...? I thought I'd suggest that you can do what you like with me. - Oh! What? - You've got my full consent. - Are you serious? - Absolutely. That's very kind, it really is. I don't know what to say, but... But as you're offering, yes, please. Yes... So cozy. Hey, wait a minute... Is it not feeling good? I mean... I might not be ripe for this. Or I might be overripe. - Am I not your type? - Yes, but... Filip, you're really lovely. You look great. It's really generous of you. It's fantastic. I... It's the nicest thing anybody has given me. I'm glad you said no when you didn't feel like it. You shouldn't do anything you don't want to do. I understand that this was very sudden. Wait! I'm not going to die curious, damn it! Well, then. - Hi! How are you doing? - I'm fine. I'm a bit behind, but the root vegetables and the meat are in the oven. What's this? We're having Toast Skagen as a starter. I thought people can peel their own prawns and dip. DIY Toast Skagen. It's not Skagen if you dip a prawn in aioli. It's not a cruise, we're not doing a prawn buffet. We have to peel all the prawns fast as hell. Jesus. Hey... - What is it? - Damn, I... I'm sorry. It's me. No, it's my fault. It's Lisa's fault. She kidnapped me all day. Just relax, breathe. I've heard that you're nervous. I'll deal with this. Take Buster to Lisa. I do this. And... - take a shower. Okay? - Yes, okay. Come, Buster. What a culture clash! - This was so good. You did well. - Really good! - You look so nice. - Thank you. - Super nice. - I love it. Thank you so much. It was unnecessary to get stressed out on the mountain. We could have hung out there. Dear, lovely friends... I'm standing here as your best man for the second time. Isn't that great? And it's amazing that I get to be here. I just ended up here in your nice and warm group. You're so good at grabbing life even though it's a bit dark at times. With those words, I'd like to turn to the light of our lives. The groom, Patrik. Well... I'm so glad that you're all here to celebrate with us. It feels fantastic. Living in a bonus family can be a challenge. Everybody here knows that. It can break even the strongest of us. Lisa, without your love, understanding and forgiveness, without your strength, we would never have ended up standing here today. - I'm going to read a poem. - This will be fun. It's very much us. I think it's nice. Morning. "When the morning's sun steals through the window pane Happy and cautious Like a child who wants to surprise Early, early on a festive day Then I stretch full of growing exultation my open arms to the coming day For the day is you, and the light is you The sun is you, and the spring is you And all of the beautiful waiting life is you." - I love you, Lisa. - Thanks, darling. I love you too. So nice! Cheers! My God, that was lovely. Thanks! That was beautiful. - Can I go and pee now? - Yes. I've needed to go for so long! - Patrik, good effort. - Thanks. - That was from the heart. - I was so touched. - Have you told Martin? - No, he kind of saw through me. - What do you mean? - I guess he's a mind reader. No, he isn't a mind reader! This is so damn clumsy! If Patrik finds out about this, he'll think... fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! The whole thing's fucked with my head. I'm not made for this. I don't want you to feel bad. You're my best friend. Come on! I care a lot about you. Have you developed feelings for me? No! It's not about that. I... I can barely remember. We were drunk. But the fact that I have to hide it from Patrik and I'm in the middle between you, I can't deal with that. - You have to tell him. - I will. - I'm breaking. - I will tell him, but not tonight. Sorry, Patrik. Yes, it was him. And... Damn! I didn't tell you because I couldn't stand ruining the weekend more when you'd made it all so nice. I thought it would just be too much, Patrik. And far too difficult. It was wrong of me, so wrong. I'm sorry. But both of us have been unfaithful. It's... Is that the most important thing? Who it was? Maybe that's true. It would have been equally hard regardless of who it was. Could we just promise each other that henceforth... we'll be completely honest with each other about what we think, feel and mean? - And that we don't lie to each other. - Absolutely. Of course. It'll be fine. You'll remarry each other now Yes, you'll be doubly wed Double man and double wife You've worked your way Through a lot of grief and such But now it's time to live Just live to fight another day Just go on Yeah, you go on You're made for each other Yes, the two of you Love will conquer all And that is just so cool Sometimes things can feel like too much But just chill out Just go on Yeah, you go on Of course it's hard From time to time Yes, it's up and it is down You have kids and then some more You go on Yeah, you go on Yeah, you go on You go on, for better or for worse Better and worse, just life and death Now you're standing there with smiles It makes me glad, I just want some more Of all the love you give That's why we sing to you You go on Yeah, you go on - You go on! - Good, Mom! Go on! Nice! I can't do anymore! You're so good! - Super nice! - Jens! Come and sit down. Why are you hiding over there? Hey, I'd like to thank you for a very special New Year's Eve. Thanks for the beautiful singing. Wonderful! You must have rehearsed a lot. So nice, with choreography and singing in harmony. You're quite the artists in hiding. That lyric, "you go on"... My ex-wife Ylva and I did that. We went on. When she left me before Christmas... I felt that it was just as well that I got cancer. Everything was over anyway. But then, all of a sudden, I started to feel relief, strangely enough, to be rid of her. And now that's a liberation. To do what I want with my life. What little I have left. Without having to adapt to someone you're annoyed with and who is irritated with me. Now I'm trying to find out who I am. I'm just regretting that we didn't get divorced sooner. I could have explored new parts of myself. But I'm sorry, this wasn't supposed to be about me. It's about the two of you, Lisa and Patrik. I've seen you plod on with therapy year after year. - It hasn't really given you anything. - Jan... Absolutely not. I don't think... Now, you two wonderful people are getting married again. I don't know, what the hell... Can't you try something new instead? This is your chance. I'm sorry, but why not try to live, damn it? And not just go on. Jan! That's enough! Look at Martin and Molly. Looking at you makes me happy. Two lovely, childish, imbecile... ...maniacs. That's what love should look like. Not an eternal struggle. There! End your speech and we'll move on. - It's not their wedding, it's ours. - It's hard to find... Shut up now! That's enough! What do I know? I'm just an old man who is going to die soon. Forget what I said. Well, cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Damn, what a speech. There was a lot to digest there. Thanks, Jan. - Are you an asshole because you're dying? - I was just trying to be honest. You're bound by professional secrecy! What are you doing? As your therapist, it's a different mode. But as your friend, I'm taking the liberty of being frank. Well, I'll be frank with you. Go to hell! - Friends... - No, you can go to hell! If he wasn't ill, I would have reported him. He's crazy. Good that he's not practicing anymore. I don't know, there's probably something in what he said. Of course not! He's a fucking sick old man on serious medication. He's crazy! - Maybe he's right too. - What? I have to make an effort for you. And you have to make an effort for me. Is that how it should be? That's what you do in a relationship. You make an effort for each other. You have to be able to relax together. I don't feel that I can do that with you. It tastes of summer. This is so good! - Hey, Hawk-Hans is here. - Thank you. We have the kids. We're a family. Hi. The wedding officiant is here now. Do you want to come down and say hello and go through with the ceremony? I think that means that he'll have to wait a little. That's fine. There's time before midnight. But not a lot of time. You want to give up? I don't know if I think it's giving up. - Maybe we're just taking a new road. - Separate roads, you mean? Hey? Have you thought about Buster? He'll be devastated. I don't think so. I think he'll feel better. If we have every other week, we'll have time to recover and be better parents. - You've given it a lot of thought. - Yes, of course. Haven't you done that with Elin? Filip, for fuck's sake! Stop it! - Hi! - They're tired. Are you coming later? The officiant dude is here. - Yeah. - Hi, sweetie. Good night. Hey... There's a bit of a delay. No panic. - My family is waiting. - I understand that. Just a bit of patience. Did you hear that? There's a small delay, but wow! That's nice. Is it a local tradition? I love you so much. I love you too. Hi, Lisa. Don't stress, but it's actually time now. It won't happen. Okay, okay. Could I have your attention? I have the dubious pleasure of telling you that the wedding is unfortunately not going ahead. - What? - Oh, dear! - Awkward. - Oh, my God... - What does this mean? Can I go home? - It won't happen tonight. You can go. - Is anybody surprised? - No, not me. This is damn sad. But the New Year's party is still on. Let's have some bubbly, and we'll get the disco started. Yes! Damn! Fire in the hole! Come on, damn it! Now there's a disco. Let's go in and dance. Come on! Hey... It's possible if you want it. We've done it before. We've done it before because... we've had such a strong spark together. But that disappeared. It disappeared for me with Elin. And... - It's my fault, isn't it? - No, no. It's nobody's fault. This would probably have happened anyway. Maybe we've just had our "run." We've had our fantastic years that have been absolutely wonderful. We've been so lucky. When I came up here to work these last six months... I've felt free. And happy. That tells me something. So it's not happening. You're deciding that now. I didn't decide that things would end up like this. No. So it's Jens or what? Who is deciding? - There's no point in talking. - No, there's no point. Just throw everything away! Daddy, I can't sleep. I thought that a good way to die could be to take an overdose. They say that injecting heroin is absolute happiness. Your mom and I are just like you and Buster. Sometimes we argue, and then we make up. You don't have to worry. Things will work out. The important thing is that we're together. That we have a nice time. It's nicer when you two aren't together. You're happier when you're on your own. So is Mom. Sweetheart... - I'm tired. - I'm really tired too. Hi. Were you able to sleep? We're going after breakfast. Or you can stay for a few days. I'm only working anyway. If you want. You can come, but you have to shut up. Whoops... Hi, gorgeous. - Damn, what a party! - Yes. - Shit, I got drunk! - Yes, some of us were... - Ouch! - Oh, I'm sorry! Never mind. How was the wedding? Was it cute? Don't cover your mouth. I smell too. - Was it nice? - Well, you didn't really miss anything. - Hello. - Hi. - Are you going already? - Yes. We're going now. I thought about the party. Is it still...? - That's right. - Is it okay if...? Yes, of course. Do it. That's fine. We can stay with Filip. Thanks. Thanks a lot, I really mean it. - See you. - Yeah. Thank you so much. I guess we'll talk more at home later. Drive carefully. Bye, darlings. I'll see you in a few days. Bye! MARCH - Does anybody want anymore? - No, thanks. Where is the 4-H farm? I haven't been there for so long. Wasn't it in M√§larh√∂jden, Dad? Eh, yes. Maybe we can do that next weekend? Right? If you want to tag along, that's great. - Thanks for dinner. - You're welcome. - Are you going, Daddy? - No, clear the table. And we'll read a good-night story. I'll clear it off. Put the plate down, you can go and read. We'll brush your teeth. Hey, Patrik, I mean... I know that you've had a... a really, really shitty time. If you need help with anything or you want to talk about something... I'm here. Just let me know. Thanks. Hey, I thought... You mean a lot to me. You're always going to be my family. - Did it go well? - She's asleep now. You can be here as much as you want during my weeks if you miss them. Thanks, I'm fine. It will be fine. I know it. I like you so much, Patrik. I know that we'll be the best bonus family when things have settled down. You'll meet a girl who is smart, calm and grown-up. Then you'll thank me and you'll feel good again. I'm sure of that. But these things take time. We just need to find energy to get through this first disgusting bit. Yeah, that's probably right. I'll talk to you later. Bye. MAY SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE Microwave meals? Wow. Hello. Hi. Did you think I was dead? No, I didn't think that. - Apparently I had some time left. - Okay. That's nice. Good. How are you doing? Well, you might be able to imagine. No? It's fucking difficult. Oh? Yes. We got a divorce. I'm damn low. Lisa left me on New Year's Eve. Maybe you remember? Mm. - What? - Let's hope you get over it sometime. - Yes, let's hope so. - Yes. Men are bad at being left. Most have a hard time getting back on their feet. It might take years. If it runs in the family, you should take extra care. Yes, okay. An important tip. Thanks. Sorry, I'm thinking of your dad. He passed away before he got over Eva, didn't he? Hey, Jan! I just wanted to say to you... - you're a damn lousy therapist. - Really? I don't know how many thousands of kronor I spent on your therapy. Maybe 100,000? More like 150,000. But divide it by two. Never mind! You just sat there, nodded and asked questions. "What do you think about that? Why do you think that is?" No constructive advice. You get that six years later at the grocery store without asking for it! Can't you be a normal human and show support and empathy? JUNE Yes, may they live Yes, may they live for a hundred years Of course, they will live Of course, they will live Of course, they will live For a hundred years Four hurrahs for our youngsters! Hip, hip... hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! - Congratulations! - Cheers for Eddie and Wille. - Cheers! - Cheers, everybody! Hey, behind me, there's cake and other treats. And there's grown-up drinks one floor up. Then I'd like to say that I... am really happy to see you all here again. Six months ago, it was pretty fucking depressing. That's why it's extra nice that we're all gathered here again. And it's nice to feel that we're a damn lovely big bonus family. We're the best! We're best, damn it! Cheers for us. Long live us. Cheers. - Cheers! - Bravo! - You've made it really nice. - Thanks. I forgot to buy coffee, but... It happens. It's nice to see that you seem happy. - It's really nice. - Yes. - Do you want a glass of wine? - I'd love one. - I feel good. - It shows. It really does. I forgot to say that I... I'm glad things turned out like they did. And... I want to thank you. It was brave of you to dare. I like you so much, Patrik. - I really do. - I like you a lot too. I always will. Have you met anyone? You have met someone! I can tell! So nice! Congratulations. I told you it would happen. Yes, it feels fun. Who is this girl? Anybody I know? - Mmm. - So, who is it? Tell me! What's her name? It's Elin. - Wait, Elin? That Elin? - Yes. - Are you joking? - What about Elin? - What? - We're dating a bit. - Please, of all the people? - The fucking broad you cheated with? - You told me to meet someone new. - Yes, someone new. Not Elin! - Elin is good for Patrik. - Who the hell cares? - Shut up! - It's none of your business. - That Elin? - Cheers for Elin! Yes! I'll start dating a serial killer. Cheers for love!
