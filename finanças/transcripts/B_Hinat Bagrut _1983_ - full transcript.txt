Where did you buy the...? -What? -You know. What? -You know. -The condoms? Orna's decided to give out? Not her. A guy asked me to get him some. Look, nobody uses condoms.

Arithmetics, right? -Mom, where's my purple coat? She put lipstick on! -lt's no lipstick, dumbhead! Where is it? -On the hanger in the hall. Orna, come here. -What is it? You going to Ronny's? -Yes, why? He promised me long ago to bring Yaeli the '' Crazy Chicken'' video. Alright. -No, he promised you. Me, you, same thing. As long as it's here.

Judith, you' re going straight to bed or you' re gonna get it. Nighty-night. You promised me a story! -OK, alright. Keep quiet. Don't wake him up. We were reading '' Max and Moritz'' , right? Their teacher was a very wise man so Max and Moritz decided to set him up. They put a bomb in his pipe and he blew up. Bang! Here, he's all black. Then they took some cockroaches and the miller sold them to all the kids. Nice, eh? Yes. -Great story. Now go to sleep. Good night. They' ll never go to sleep. -They will. Avner's already asleep and l hope Judith falls asleep too Did you get any? No. They were fresh out of. l mean, l didn't have the nerve to ask. Relax. These are my safe days. What's that? Sounds ominous. Ten days after... My period, you know. -OK, never mind. Thought you'd want to know. -lt's too embarrassing. l' m scared. -Me too. Hide under the table? Anything to drink? l' m awfully thirsty. My throat's as dry as a bone. How am l going to sing in the choir tomorrow? Here, l've got something for you. One swallow of this and the guys start playing like mad. There are all kinds of vitamins in here, especially vitamin C and... What are you thinking about? l don't understand why. Why didn't they include Jamchi in the first five? No, seriously. What are you thinking about? Dunno... This is the big league, right? The books say l should be crying now. And l should be smoking a cigarette. Did it hurt? -No. lt felt strange. As if l was watching the whole thing from aside. Was it good for you? Yeah. Terribly new. Do you love me? Very much. How about some breakfast? Or Dinner? Coffee? A newspaper? No. Let's stay like this. As if l didn't have to go home. No time to eat. -At least take an orange with you. Yael, hurry up. -Here's your lunch. Eat it all. -Here's your video. Your omelette. -l don't want any. Let's have a go at it. Almost got it! He wasn't always like that. When we met, as students, he'd go out and demonstrate. Everything was an issue. -You lived together, right? For a year, in the dorms, before we got married. And you had sex, right? Orna' le, when you and Ronny share a room in the dorms l' ll tell you my secrets. Until then, you' re late. Hurry up, will you? Stop it already! You' re like two little children! You' ll be late for work and you for school. ' Bye! What's your score? -207. What's mine? -Six. -Well, it's a new game. Enough already! -Excuses, excuses. When will you be back from school? At noon. -Good! l've a short day too. Come on. See you! -See you. Physics. Gross something. -That Gross again! He's handsome, isn't he? l'd love to hit on him. Rumour is that since you got together he misses rebounds. What are you doing to him? -l just love him. -Excuse me Good morning. -' Morning. ...and then another kind of poetry begins, more lsraeli, or '' purely lsraeli'' as some are calling it. That of Shlonsky and Alterman. '' l dreamed we were together last night. Love you. Orna'' Try and find the books. Another dream coming up tonight. My place, 1 9:00. Bring it to our next class, then we' ll begin. Remember those '' safe'' days? -Yes. So? They' re over. That's it? Alright. l' ll be careful. What is it? lt's nothing. How about you go on the pill? l' ll need to go to the doctor. l don't want to. OK, let's just wait a few more days. -OK. l don't want to. l won't! Hey, kid! What's your name? -llan. l' m Omri. Nice to meet you. llan, l' m going to make you an offer, first and last and unique. This is an electric shaver, with batteries, 3 year warranty. 400 shekels only. -l don't shave. What d'you mean you don't shave? Listen, 3 years from now this' ll cost like a car. By then you' ll have grown a huge beard. Don't wanna. l don't shave! -Buy it for your Dad. l' m losing on it. -l don't want it. 1 , 000 shekels, for Mom? -She's already got one. lt's American! Japanese! Teach... You' re early! Could be my watch. Yeah. Could be. l happen to have here an Omega watch. -Omega? Second hand. -Yes, l' m missing an Omega here. OK, we' ll talk later. Zahi, let's get together at break, l' ll tell you about that girl last night at the pub. You've no idea! Found somebody who liked your looks, Omri' le? l called you, you know, but your Mom said you went out with a whole company of parachutists. Two companies. Two! -Whatever. Ronny, what's up? Alon? -What? A shaver. 60. -40. -What? OK. Hair dryer. 200. -What hair? Yours. lt's always wet. Get of it! Leave me alone! Zipi... A hair dryer. -What hair? Guard him tightly. Lately you've been missing shots... All right. Daliah... How do you two keep from...? -We don't. Aren't you scared? -We just don't. How about you? -We don't, either. Yes. That's it. That's it. Now we can start. -Hit it! We' ll resume tomorrow. Good bye. So we've decided to rent the car for a week and go on to St. Moritz. To the snow. lt was very nice, and we were lucky to get a hotel room for 80 francs a night. Could be. You could also be late. Five days are more than just late! Let's go see a doctor. -What Dr.? -A gynecologist. Maybe Ruthie knows someone who... -That's all l need. Tomorrow, the whole school will know about it! l' m only trying to help. -l know. Look, ,my cousin works at the hospital. We could go ask her if she knows a good doctor who... We' ll tell her that a friend of mine got into trouble. l don't know. All of a sudden everything looks so bleak. Whenever l close my eyes l see doctors, your folks, mine, and they' re all angry. lf you only took the pill. What pill? What is this, a bloody commercial? You should've bought those condoms! l couldn't, and l didn't want to! Besides, Omri says you only use them with the whores, so as not to get a disease. Then let Omri go on the pill! OK. l' m going in to look for the doctor's phone number. Can l speak with Dr. Tavor? -Speaking. This is an emergency. l'd like to... Please calm down and tell me your problem. She's late. Who's late? -l mean... -Your wife! My girlfriend. -Why did you say that? Excuse me? -l see. This is what you should do. -Yes? Come to my clinic. l' ll send her to do a blood test, then you come back to me with the results. Make a fist. You didn't have to pay, it's my pregnancy! -No pregnancy. Are you coming? -No! They won't have the results before 4 o'clock. Let's go to school. -l don't wanna! Would you mind explaining what's happening to us? l don't think we' re going through the same thing. All the time you' re organizing things, as if l' m some kind of a project in biology! l've had it! l want to be left alone! Love me? -l do, but what's that gotta do with anything? What d'you mean? Movies and making love? That's all there is to it? Want to be left alone? Be my guest. Hi. Can l speak with Ruthie? You' re not pregnant. How d'you know? Look at all those numbers! Orna' le, l've been through this more than once. Believe me, you' re not pregnant. Does your mother know? -Sure! Since their divorce she's become my friend. Who gave you the pills? l' m not taking any pills. -Then what d'you do? We broke up. -What happened? He started managing my life. lt was too much pressure. That's alright. You just needed some time away. Now you' ll find out if you really love him. Let's go in. '' Dr. A. Tavor'' You' re not pregnant. Just like l said! -And you are? -Ruthie. That's alright, she's with me. Orna, you were late because of stress and anxiety. lt's normal. Dr. Tavor. -Yes? -She and her boyfriend were careful, l mean they were using '' safe days'' , coitus interruptus etc. We should give her some pills. Ruthie! '' Microginnon 30'' would be best for her. But you' re the doctor. -Yes. l almost forgot. l think it would be better if l examined her before l gave her anything. Do you agree? -Yes, yes, by all means. Go in, take your underwear off and sit in the chair. Come, l' ll help you. -That's as far as you go. lt's her first time. l want to help. Orna, what l' m going to do now is check your cervix. Lean back, please. That's all. You can get dressed now. lt's starting to rain. l just wanted to tell you that everything's all right. Ruthie checked you? -Dr. Tavor did. l' m fine. Yeah. l guess. Your Mom's books. Thank her for me. l will. ' Bye. lt's no big deal. -What? Some people don't even return the books they borrow. Your bike is free now. -Let it go, Omri. lf you feel like being alone you can come to me. l' ll... -l said let it go! Okay. -Thank you. This poem is a little more lyrical. More loving. A little different from what we've seen so far. '' l shall come to your door'' . '' l shall come to your door with trembling lips '' l shall stretch out my hands towards you ''Then l shall say the words that l promised to keep '' And that would be forever yours...'' Are we going to get that humus? What's the matter with you? One little humus is all! You've got to read this book. lt's about a 1 2 year old boy who leaves home. Why go straight home? Let's go have some humus first. Daphna, come here. Want a ride home? -Sure. What' re you doing? -l' ll see you tonight. What's tonight? There's a party tonight. You coming? Yeah. Come upstairs for some coffee? -No, thanks. Suit yourself. ' Bye. Good evening. lt's not bad at all. Give it here. -No, no... No, thanks. lt won't kill you. -l don't smoke. At all. Anything else you don't do at all? Anything l don't want to do. What' re you waiting for? Dancing? Lego? Games, maybe? -l' m not waiting for anything. lf you focus on your own heartbeat... Focus on your own heartbeat. And another thing. Flow with your blood. lt's cosmic energy. l swear. -l' m splitting. Yeah? Why? Why? What's the matter? -l' m bored out of my skull! lf only you understood what it's like to... The party's just starting! -l' m gonna party at home, in bed, with a good book and some biscuits. Got biscuits, eh? -What kind of biscuits? Some friends you've got. You know, if you get into that cosmic flow... You a couple! l' m just the fifth wheel here... Why didn't you say so? lt should be you and me... Don't tell me you just happened to pass by. Daliah? Bible studies: 7 0. -90. 7 0. -1 00. Biology? -90. -1 00. l'd like to know. You got nothing less than 1 00? Not even one or two? -Yes. 90 in gymnastics. She must've cheated in the long jump and she got caught. Very funny. -Yeah, it's funny. No, it's not funny. What is it? -What's the matter? Got any valium for me? -What is it, Ruthie? l passed! l passed! l can't believe it! l suggest we go to Eilat for three days. Take our sleeping-bags. -To Eilat on my bike?! lt won't get me half way. -Wait a minute. l have an idea. We could go to Hadera via Wadi Ara, then to Megido Junction where there's a lot of... Geography. -Then we could go back along the beach down to Sidney Ali. -That's across from Eilat. Omri! Omri! What's the matter? They've expelled me. -What' re you talking about? Absences. Tardiness. You know, all that crap. My bad marks. The lot. You' ll have to tell your parents. -They already know. And? lt's nothing new. lt's started when l had to repeat ninth grade. They were worried about what their friends would say. l said l'd go to a technical school or out to work. But they wanted their son to become a lawyer. Well, all that is history now. From now on, l' m managing my own life. Are you out of your mind? You' re enlisting?! -l' ll be 1 8 soon. So? Do your folks know about this? -They will. l've had enough of this shit. l' ll do my army service, then l' ll start doing stuff. What stuff? -The stuff you do with money. l got an F in mathematics but l've made tons of money in business this year. l' m good at these things. l don't need one penny from my folks, OK? Come see me in the army, l' ll give you a hard time. See you around. -Forget it, Omri. You' re coming with us on a bike trip. They can expel you from school but getting out of the gang isn't that easy. Wait. Ruthie, come here a sec! Listen, don't you...? -l' ll set it straight. l' ll get it right for you. You just shut up. Ruthie! -Yes? This is Omri. He's... Get to the point! He's coming with us, on your scooter. You' re managing me now? Listen, get off it. See you in the army. Omri! -What's going on? He got expelled from school, he's going to the army for three tough years and we can't give him two nice days? Alright, l' ll call him. '' Such a beautiful trail Only takes time and speed '' Such a beautiful trail Right now it's all we need '' Such a beautiful trail Let us storm it to the end '' Storm it from end to end...'' Hands off, Omri. What's the matter with you? You think l want to touch you? l keep falling off! -Then what's this for? l keep falling off! l can't take it anymore! Just the waist, hear? -Sure, no problem. '' Such a beautiful trail -All doors are opening to us '' Such a beautiful trail -Valleys and hills and such '' Such a beautiful trail Let us storm it to the end '' Storm it from end to end '' We' ll take our exams between the sheets '' Drawn by gravity like two connected vessels '' We' ll pass our tests, don't need the marks ''You and me... -Me and you -So much in love...''

The Crusaders built this stadium in the 1 200 B.C. lt held 1 0, 000 seats. They built cloakrooms, invested in facilities, did a good thing here. Say, would you like to go in the caves on top? -No! All you care about is the water and making out! -Yeah! Look at the sun setting. Outstanding! lt's nothing compared with what happened to me once. l set down... Down, down almost to the carburetor. Some setting-down that was. Reminds me of the downfall of the Roman empire. -Who? The Roman empire. lt looks more like tomato with eggs. Same thing. Big and yellow. Who made this bonfire? -Yoav did. Just like him. -Yoav, what's the bonfire for? How d'you say '' virgin'' in African? '' Nohymenba'' . -'' Noinba'' . -What's that? '' Noinba'' . That's '' virgin'' in African. Got it! And '' whore'' ? -Noinba? lninba! Nice! -And if her father tells the joke? No father would tell such a joke. Then it's '' lninba, lnbabba ininba'' . Got it? -You' re killing me. -l' m killing him. Was l laughing? -Yeah, you were laughing. Music... Where have we been all those years? We were running around. -Yeah. Maybe we were just practicing for this moment. But now you' re going to the army. -Just for a while. But at least now l know what for. -What for? To defend you. Ruthie's Defence Forces. That's me. l miss you already, my soldier. Your boyfriend. -My boyfriend? You want to be my boyfriend? -That and much more. Orna! You' ll wake the Crusaders! -l' m looking for my pills. You' ll find pain-killers in the pocket. -No, The Pill. Take one from Ruthie tomorrow. -Changing's bad. What? l forgot to take one yesterday, too. -You did? Because of the rush. -So? We' ll have to choose a name for the child. What child? -Ours. We' ll call him Doron Jamchi. -And if it's a girl? No problem. We' ll call her Berkowitz. Look. What do you think? Sure. Let's go inside. lt's cold out here. What's this? What's this? lnside, girl. lnside! Think parsley will do on a pie? He's eating army food. He' ll love it. The only thing Omri loves is his business deals. Half his letters are about what to buy and what to sell But the other half... -What should l do? l think you should take Ronny, go to the lab and do the test. l don't really miss our separation last year. l'd go with you but Omri... l could go with you tomorrow. lt's him! l missed you terribly. Thief! l've been practicing those words the whole month. l love you so much. We've got 6 hours to put it to a test. Orna. -A soldier, eh? -Yeah. OK, l' ll leave you guys alone. l made you a meal fit for a soldier. A meal? -Chinese style. A smashing pie. Right now l' m not thinking about food. l had a falafel. l' m full. l'd rather have some... -What is it? Omri, what's the matter? -lt's the bullet l took. What' re you talking about? -lt was nothing serious. Where? -Got it in the kidney. They took it out. Here, look. l can't even talk. You little liar! No bullet, no Chinese food, no nothing. l rather wanted Chinese. And l was all for dessert. l' m Orna Shapiro. l' m here for the results of my test. -What kind of test? Blood test for pregnancy. -l' ll go look for it. Orna Shapiro. Here you are. What does it mean? -Positive. You' re pregnant. Thanks. Ronny! Hi! Come in the water, you chicken! -Ronny! l came to tell you that... -What? Nothing. You' re handsome like that. -Even better as a swimmer. Now watch me tearing this swimming-pool apart. When you count to 20 l' ll be at the other side. Ready? When l give you the sign. Start counting. Now! One, two, three, four, five... Twenty? Yes! lf you' re not asleep we can't begin. You' re falling asleep... Go to sleep! -l can't. Go to sleep! l know l' m not asleep! l can't sleep! -You' re falling asleep now. l' m not. -Yes you are. -l' m not! l' m not! l' m not asleep! l' m not asleep! l' m not. l know l' m not. Everything OK? See you. Ronny? Go to sleep now. You' ll be fine. You' re asleep now. -l' m not. -Yes you are. Show her to her. Mrs. Shapiro, you a have a daughter. Orna! Orna' le! What? What is it, you had a bad dream? lt' ll go away. You OK? -Yes. -All right? Yeah. -That's good. Honey, l' m in a rush. lt's already 07: 1 5. Do me a favor, send Yaeli to school, OK? Have something to eat. Give her breakfast. l' ll be home by noon. Alright. l want a sandwich with a pickle, and grapes and a chocolate. And l want it in bad 'cause l' m sick. -OK! l have the flu and the mumps. What's the matter with you? Ronny! So, you've decided on abortion? -Yes. Orna? -Yes. Why? We have to finish school, do our matriculation, army service, university. We' re not yet ready to deal with this kind of thing. Have you considered all the risks involved? A friend of mine had an abortion and she's fine. l'd like to explain. There could be an internal damage. You could develop a severe infection which would mean this would be your last child. l want you to understand that. You' re saying that every abortion is a disaster? Not necessarily. But l want you to think about it, to weigh it seriously. -We have. We don't want the... This child. Fine. Here are the forms for the abortion committee. Go to the social worker, fill them up together and come back to see me in two days. Thank you. You' re against it, right? l' m a doctor. A pregnancy is not a disease. So many forms! Maybe Ruthie knows a doctor who needs fewer forms. Orna? Orna? lf we had him, who d'you think he'd resemble to? To the sleeping-bag in which he'd been conceived. l gave birth to a doll. -What?! Nothing. Let's go. -Where? To school, to speak with Ruthie. -No! lf we do it, l want Dr. Tavor and the hospital. '' lf'' we do it? -l don't know. l' m confused. He said to come back in two days. Let's wait. Okay. Hold this a sec. Daliah, what is it? lt's Omri. Omri?! He was here just the day before yesterday. Only for 6 hours. That's very little, right? '' l came in the flesh instead of a letter,'' he said. We laughed, and l held him. l held him tight and l wouldn't let go. We' re so young. Why don't they let us grow up? l don't want him to stop coming back! l want him back! What shall l do with all the photos and the letters? l can't be alone! Omri! Omri! ''The Committee for Termination of Pregnancies'' lt's out of the question. They want to get married. To who? -To each other, dummy. Orna's pregnant. l' m gonna be an uncle. -Me too. l' ll talk to Ronny. Ridiculous! We' ll have an abortion! -'' We'' ? lt's my child and l want it! You think flying course would give you a pass to go see your kid?
