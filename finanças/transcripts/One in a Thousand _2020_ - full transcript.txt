You're so pretty! Hey, baby. Beautiful. ONE IN A THOUSAND -Get off! -I was there first. You're such a pain. Aunt Claudia said you should stop with the hand jobs. Gross! Hi, Roc?o. What smells? -No, Iris, no. -Gross! How long has that been sitting there? Dar?o, there's no connection. Did you change the password? No. It's "Roc?o" and my last three ID numbers. Which are...? 407. I got it. Turn it down a bit. Hurry up! Take your sister along if you go out. Roc?o! -Hey. -Hey. -Hi. -What's up, bro? -Happy birthday. -How are you? Cool. -Happy birthday. -Hi. -Hi, gorgeous. -Hi. How are you? I missed you. What have you been doing? It's been a long time. Not so much. -How are you doing at basket? -Good. Have you scored many times? She's like Ginobili. She never misses a shot. I know. -Want a drink? -No. -What do I get you? -Nothing. What do you mean nothing? Let's get them some drinks. They're so stuck-up. All they can think of is getting wasted. At this rate, she'll get pregnant. Claudia said she had three abortions. Really? Can you do it so many times? Sure. It's not the best, but you can. Such a bummer being prego. She's a great player. -Basket is all that matters to you? -Yes. If I was a woman, I'd sleep around. Ale, come here! All of you! We don't bite! Some of us do. One of us does bite, though. -Who could it be? -Hi. You should ask what they bite not who they bite. No, thanks. -Come on, man. -Come on. It's a party. You have to drink. Yeah, man. Drink up. It won't kill you. -Have some, Iris. -No, thanks, I don't drink. Do it for me. It's my birthday. -I don't like drinking. -She's a healthy girl. Fine. OK, guys, let's play a game. -What the hell? -No way. -Let's play a game. -Let's keep drinking. Count to 50... Not that stupid hide and seek. My leg hurts. -It's just a game. -Suck my dick. -The cops shot me, man. -Fuck off. -You're all playing. Shut it. -Back off. -Count to 50. -You're a five-year-old. You know the drill. If you play hard to get, you drink up. -Come on, go! -Count to 50. Come on, go! One, two, three, four, five... six, seven... JESUS SAVES YOU Wait, wait. Sorry. -Where did they go? -They went that way. Yo, Iris. Let go. Let go! No, don't throw that. Hey, get off her! Get out of here, you jerks! Run! Crazy bitch. Motherfucking kids. -Hey, are you OK? -Yeah. Thanks. -They can get fresh. -I'll beat them up next time. -They pee into the balloons. -What? -They pee into them, right, Rama? -What? They pee into them. -You've got to be careful. -Watch out. -Want some? -No, thanks. -Mom, close the door! -Are you getting high again? -I'm not high! -Go get a job! -I don't ask you for money, Mom! -You never work, you just get high! -You don't work either! -I do work! -Close the door now, Mom! -I won't close it! Shut the hell up! Get out! I don't screw up your nap! Yes, you do! That's all you do all day long! PHARMACY PERFUMERY -Why are you being so jumpy? -You scared me there. You've been avoiding me. Me? When was your last time in the hood? I moved out. This area is too much of a mess. -Why? -Lots of reasons. I'm hooking up with someone. -Who? -You don't know her. She works in the supermarket. I came to pick her up. She's older. -What time does she get off? -In a while, I guess. -She's not allowed to use her cell. -I found a bike. -Let's have a soda while I wait. -Sure. -A bike. -Who is he? -I'll tell you later. Up. -I found a bike. -And a dinosaur. -Put it in there. I got paid, but not much. I'll look for another club. -How have you been? -Keeping busy. I have a delivery bike now. It's my night job. -Here. -Is the pay any good? It does the trick. We take turns with the kid. She works during the day and I work at night. -Come on. -That's crazy. -No! -By yourself? -Yes. -And does he know? Aunt! Move away! -What does he call you? -"Aunt." -Aunt it is. -Yep. -He doesn't know. -Move away. OK. -I got very fond of him. -I can imagine. The boy will get there first, go! Take a picture, it will last longer. -Do you know her? -Sure. How could I not? Who doesn't know Renata? -Renata? -Yes, everybody knows her. It's odd seeing her around, she had moved out. So... you're acquaintances? We used to. She's a mess now. She's all day at Traumatic. -Traumatic? -Never been there? -No, never. -You'll see her if you go there. But she's all over the place. She has HIV. -What? -Yes, she got HIV. How could you know that? The word was out. That's why she left. Everybody knew it in the hood. She had sex to buy drugs. That's bullshit, Dulce, people make up all sort of shit. I'm serious. I know her. We used to be close. -Will you jump? -No. -OK. -I don't want to. You don't? Jump. Go. You want the dino? Dar?o, have you seen my charging cable? What the hell? That's gross, Dar?o! Not your business. Excuse me. Remember the weird girl I told you about? I heard she has HIV. How do you know? Honey, Dar?o. -Where is it? -Where's what? -You took it. -What thing? -My earring. Is it here? -How should I know? It's not here, Mom. You're such a pain. I'm off to work. There's food in the pot. For you too, Iris. Let Ale know. How did you find out? A friend told me. She said she's up to no good and... It feels like shit, you know? Why? She's about my age. So what? I don't know. It just feels like shit. Why? Why? You know... She's so young. If she had stuck to basket, that wouldn't have happened. Dar?o, feed Roc?o and turn off the air conditioning in my room. Fine! So if she had kept playing basket with you, she'd be fine now? That's not what I meant. But it might have helped her. That's stupid. "How to fuck...?" "How to fuck girls with HIV?" Don't google that! I wasn't thinking about that. "How to fuck lesbian girls with HIV?" It's no use. It'll show tons of results. Aren't you hot? Let's go to Mom's room with air conditioning. "How to fuck without getting infected?" "Five myths about STDs for teens." Maybe it's not that big of a deal. You could talk to her. Everybody has something nowadays, even basketball players. I finished this book today. "Myths and Risks." "Thirty diseases: chlamydia." Chlamydia. What was that? -Let me have a go. -Wait, I'm on it. -Just a minute. -Hold on. -Just a second. -Fuck off. -What the hell? -Fuck off. -That's disgusting, Dar?o. Close it. -Fine. Hi, Roc?o, hi. What are you writing? A letter. To whom? You're so old-school, Iris. Why don't you use Facebook? That's what everybody else does. Roc?o has an STD, too. She's been sleeping around. Stop with that, Dar?o. I'm sure Pablo will catch HIV sooner or later. He's been with everyone in the projects. He has to take care. He'll catch anything there is. HIV, the flu, chlamydia, everything. You too, Roc?o. I'll never fuck again. Again? I'm just saying. It's too much drama. But it's not like you fuck and you get sick. -You could do it safely. -It's not that easy, Iris. -You can't suck a dick safely. -Why not? Sucking on a condom, that's gross! -What's wrong with it? -No one does that, Iris. -How do lesbians use protection? -Fuck off. -Do you use plastic wraps? -Fuck off. -You cut a plastic bag in two... -Stop it. -Dar?o. -That's gross. Right, Roc?o? You use a plastic bag, too? "Yes." Who uses a bag? "Me!" Your cell just doesn't stop. She texts me sometimes. Sends me hearts, and then she ghosts me. Be careful. Don't let her play you... You have to think. She looks at me and I forget all the stupid things she does. -How romantic. -While she sucks you. -Wait up. I'll have a smoke. -I don't know. You say that because things are bad with your ex. Yeah, well, what can I do? I'm just saying, be careful. I'm done with all that. -Done with what? -All that. You'll find somebody. -Only for money. -She's a gold digger. -How much? -I don't know. -How much you charge? -It depends. On the client's face? What if it is an old woman? A hag? A sugar momma. -That takes you out to dinner. -I'd do it. You would? -You don't do it for money? -No. -He likes them young. -No money and no high school degree. She'll live off your woodwork. For the baby's diapers. Laugh all you want. It's all the same to you. Where's that workshop? A few blocks away. A woman wants some shoe rack. -This late? -It's too late to be working. Tell her you close at 8:00. You were following me? No. Why? You gave that impression. My friends thought the same. They said... No. Do I know you? I don't know. Maybe from the hood? When we were little, I think we played in the court. Probably. I used to go to that court a lot. Why did we grew apart? I don't know. I guess I just stopped seeing you around. Maybe. I moved out and came back not long ago. So you did know me. Now that you told me, I remembered. Do you play basket? Yes. -And you? -No. I do other things. What things? Other things. -What were you doing? -Not much. You almost missed the last bus. Yeah, that would have been trouble. Why? Where were you? At your boyfriend's? -Girlfriend's? -No. So what's the deal? -What do you mean? -What do you like? -Why? -Just curious. -Nothing. -Nothing? I'm like an angel. An angel? -Angels don't exist. -They do. -What's your name? -Iris. -What's yours? -Renata. Can I have your number? Bye. Bye. Renata! What happened? -Here. -What is it? -A letter. -For me? -Yeah. -When did you write it? Just now? No. Don't read it now. You're weird. -What will you do now? -I'm going home. -I'll walk with you. -No. -Come on. -It's OK. Bye. I'll go with you. When I went, they either ignored me or kicked me around. Without social security, you get nothing. They tell you to come back in three, four months. Maybe a clinic. You have to pay there, too. And you need social security. Hey, angel, how are you? You want to go out with me? We'll get the money somehow. But you have to get help. We can ask our aunt. Or I'll somehow manage to get it. I'll ask some relatives. The treatment is too expensive. Yo, bro. Why does everybody look at you? You know, the smaller the town, the bigger the hell. -When did you move out? -Several years now. -Where did you go? -Paraguay. Why? I dated a woman there. She was older than me and asked me to go live with her. How old was she? Forty. -And you? -Seventeen. -How old are you? -I won't tell you. -Why not? -What for? It's always good to know. I'll tell you sometime. You're so mysterious. And why did you come back? Because we broke up. We fell out and all that shit. Now my house is a mess. I have to take care of everything. I look after people now. Once I gather money, I'll go away. Where? Somewhere far away. Spain maybe. -Why? -I just like that country. Besides, they speak Spanish. I have a whole life ahead of me. Or so I was told. -OK. -I have to finish school. I go to night school, all the gangsters are in my class. Do you go to school? No. I used to go, but I got expelled because I played hooky. -Don't they complain at home? -Fortunately not. School is no use anyway. Where are we going? I don't know. Do you want to go somewhere? How about downtown? What for? To have a drink. Nah. There are some hidden parks around here. Come. Hold on. How did you learn the language? It was always part of my life. You mean speaking with words? At school. I hate speaking anyway. I never liked it. It must be weird. It's all bullshit. All people say is bullshit. Eighty per cent of what somebody says is a lie. They know it's a lie as soon as they start saying it, but they say it anyway. It took me a while to learn. Sometimes I say, "noodles with red" instead of "sauce" because my mom says it that way. That's weird. I can't picture it. One good thing, though, when I have a fight with my mom, she starts railing on me, so I turn up the music, and she doesn't notice, I just nod. She never finds out. I'd like to learn to speak like that. Can you teach me? Look at me. -What does that mean? -Wait. What is it? -What? -You didn't get it? No. -Do you want me to say? -No. When did you break up with your girlfriend? A long time now. A couple months, actually. Do you miss her? Yes. Sometimes. But I'm getting over her now. The thing I miss the most is how she sucked my pussy. -Do you get shy? -No. -She was really good at it. -Fine. Have you dated someone good at sucking? I told you, I'm like an angel. If it ever happens to you, you'll see it's something to be missed. I'd pay her to suck my pussy. No love and all that shit. The only honest thing out of her mouth was oral sex. Fine. Wait here. -Hey. -All good? Yeah. Don't forget the match on Saturday. -I won't. -Be there. Let's go. -Who is he? -A neighbor. They call him "Ant." Roque! So you want a 20-kilo tank? Iris. -Don't scratch so hard. -Don't be a wimp. "Dar?o and..." "...Toro." You have to be careful, Iris, you don't know her. Yes, Iris, watch it. What if the rumor is true? Nico said everyone knows she has HIV. Nico's full of shit. They're all jerks. He says that because she must have turned him down. He said she fucked many guys for a fix. -That's bullshit. -Will you stay around? -Yes, why? -Your brother wanted to know. -Yes, I'll stay. -I'll tell him. -Mom, don't smoke. -It's none of your business, Dar?o. -You'll die of cancer. -Shut up, you're such a drag. -It's so odd that he called. -Why are they so overprotective? I don't know. Maybe someone told them something. Aunt Claudia was talking about you. What did she say? She was talking with my mom and said you like clams. What does that mean? -You don't know? -No, I don't. "You like clams." What does that mean? What is it? Get off, Dar?o. It means you're a lesbian. That's so stupid. Why does she say that? Don't you like that girl? That's not being a lesbian. It's so stupid. Mom, stop shouting. -Look what he's doing. -Forget it. Stop! -Why do you do that? -I'm not doing anything. You can scare him without beating him. Mom! -It's my fucking horse. -Mom, what are you doing? Crazy bitch! -So much for two men. -So embarrassing. "So embarrassing." -Look what he's doing to the horse. -Forget it. It's all down your back. Don't you feel any pain? -What's up? -Hi. -All good? -Yeah. Let me introduce you, this is the angel of the hood. -Hi. -We've met before. -Yes. -The water balloons girl. -Yeah. -Why the ball? I was going to practice. Like this? -Sort of? -Where have you been? At Traumatic. We stayed there. -Were you partying? -No, working. -"Working." -What's so funny? They laugh because they just sit on their asses. -I work while they bum around. -We bum around? I'll clean my house today. Where do you live? I'm building a little room here. They told me, "Come live in the hood with us." And it was a mess with the neighbors. -Do you smoke? -No, thanks. -Hi, girls. -You're up? You're so affectionate! What a pain. Hi. -How are you? -Give me a drag. It's like this? Do you know Arroyito? -Yes. -I played there when I was little. When did you get this? Long time ago. I love it. So? What's the deal with that guy? -Who? -The one that stalked you. Oh, yes, such a pain. He said he wanted a thin girl to bone him. -He had that kink. -Gross. -Was he going to pay? -Yes. I wouldn't do it for all the money in the world. Hi, girls, how are you? Get this: a guy wanted to get fucked by her and she said no. -But you took the money? -She didn't. Oh, no. Hey. Can you imagine little Renata with a big old fart? -What does that have to do? -Impossible. -Would you do it? -Never. Boning a guy? I had to be crazy. I'm a woman. -Are you sure? -You still live with your mom. What about you? Everything all right at home? Come on. -It's like jerking off. -No, it's not. I wouldn't do it. First, because I'm not a whore. I have nothing against whores, but... it's hard for a girl like me. -I didn't want to go there. -I cheated death many times. Besides you don't get followed. I didn't mean that. I meant it's just like jerking off. -And you get paid. -I don't jerk off like that. -How do you masturbate? -Fingering my holes. -What? -What holes? The holes. They call it "muffin." Yes, you rub it like this. And you come in a sec. Did you read out on the Internet? "New ways to masturbate." You bitch. It hurts like shit. Do it at home. It hurts. Show me where. At home. Lower. Here. -There. -It hurts like hell. -What about you? -What? How do you do it? I don't do that stuff. You liar. Everybody does it. You look like a pillow fucker. What's that? You fuck the pillows. He's getting in trouble. No, you won't. A lot, a lot... Damn you. Come on. Poor Chito. You bitch. What was that? Hi... What's up with Chito? Poor guy. What are you up to? What do you care? -I'm serious. -About what? Be careful who you hang around, you're young. Don't give me that shit. I know you. I'm dead serious. "Loving someone is different from... the love you feel for your family or a friend. I asked myself all the time. What is it like? Does it happen to everybody? Are there people who never fell in love? Sometimes I think that'll be me. My friends tell me, 'You're still young. It will happen. You have to be patient.' But it's so hard to be patient at this age when you discover the world and you are permanently incited by everything. You can't wait to fall in love." What do you want to fall in love for? I don't know, to feel different. It goes on. "I don't get what's with me. It has happened to all my friends. Some have been in a relationship for years. And they're super happy with their partners. They have found their soul mate. That sounds so idiotic. The kind of thing you'd hear in romantic TV movies. That shapes our concept of how love should be, and that has been built for ages. A relationship between two..." Dar?o! Come here, honey. "They get married and have kids. And the cycle is repeated. To me, it's beyond sexuality or gender. After all, we were all raised with that idea about love. It's not wrong, but it shouldn't condition us and make us think love is only that. Everybody tells me love is too wide a concept to be put into words. If it's so wide, why is it conditioned so much? Why is it only a two-people thing? I believe we can love two or three people, or four. But society focuses so much on what other people do that if something contradicts their view, they judge it and reject it. Is it so hard to understand there are many different ways to love and be loved?" That'll be all. I mean, I wrote some more, but I don't like it. I'll take it out. But I think it should be a bit longer. I should write more. Did you write? Just silly things. -You're still writing? -Yeah. You should publish a book. -Or nobody will know what you do. -Aunt. I'm serious. Anything new, Ale? Yes, but it's not finished yet. Loving and I don't know what else. What's so funny? What were you doing in the projects? Stop it. You should watch him or you'll start buying diapers. -Just what I needed. -Shut up. They don't do that. Speaking of diapers, Roc?o is too fat. Is she on the pill? It's a treatment. She's not fat, she's full of love. We give her from our food plus hers. Don't call her fat. What with you, Iris? You've been blanking me. It's been twice. Leave her alone. -If my brother asks, I'm with you. -OK. -"Bye, Aunt." -Bye. What? Why can't we watch the flick at your place? I never invite people over. Besides, my mom doesn't understand. I came out to her, and she says I'm crazy. She laughs. I don't know why. Why do you keep smoking with that cough? Because I like it. Everyone dies eventually, anyway. Come. I know where to go. Come. -Hey. -Hey. What's up? Wait here. Come, Iris. Where-- It's so nice. Hi. So pretty. Say hi to Aunt Claudia. Hi... Hi... So pretty. Hi, pretty baby. Hi. Give Aunt Claudia a kiss. He says you smell like beer. Speaking of which, is there any more? -Check the freezer. -OK. So sweet. -What are you doing? -Nothing. It's not finished. Oh, hi, baby. You feel like sleeping already? I'm going to sleep now. Are you writing something new? Are you writing something new? Yeah, something I started this morning, but I still can't finish it. Let me hear it. It's kind of short, anyway. It says... "South wind, flying caterpillar, winter comes." It's very nice. Beautiful. What does it mean, Mom? What your brother said, honey. What else? -What's so funny? -I'm not laughing. You're mean. Gosh. You keep writing. It's beautiful. Don't mind him. It's a metaphor. What's a metaphor? -That. What your brother just read. -What? Dar?o. Oh, yes, a metaphor. You know what a metaphor is? Hey, Iris... -What? -Iris. Where is she? With a friend. Oh... What friend? A new one. Is she okay? Yeah, great. Tots great. Why? No, it's just-- I thought she wasn't well. Mom, can I ask you something? -Ask away. -Well... I actually don't know how to ask you. It's about... something I heard. The thing is... Is it normal feeling like... going when you're having anal sex? What! Son, what are you talking about? -You've never done it? -You're so cheeky. That's dangerous. Very dangerous. You have to be careful. One thing is one thing, and another thing is another thing. If you need anything, come to me. If you need money... And buy Roc?o's food. I always end up getting it. You say you love her, but you don't take care of her. -Couldn't you say something else? -That's what came to my mind. You could've said something. -Where were you? -They came here? Yeah, your brother came asking about you. He was worried. We told him you were at the burger place. Spit it out. -What? -What happened? -Nothing. -Did you guys kiss? -No. -Did you do it? -No. -Did you have safe sex? -Dar?o! -What? Silly. You'll have to come with us. No, no. Why? I've got nothing to do. You're interfering with police work. No, no, please. -Get in the truck, lady. -We'll explain at the station. Iris. Yeah? What took you so long? I went to Ale and Dar?o's. But are you OK? Yeah, Dad. Imagine what they'll be like later if that's how they start. Suffocating. I'm sick of these shitty jobs. -What? -Come. What? -It's broad daylight. -So what? Why are you so paranoid? -People talk. -And? They say I'm with you. That you are with me? That's not true. What with it, anyway? I don't know. People talk. They know you. They don't! Nobody knows me here. That's why they gossip. I don't know. What? All those things... they say. What do they say? What did they tell you? That... about... the HIV. Why do they have to say that? They all say I have HIV and that I use. Who told you? -People who know you. -Who? People who know you. I don't know. Half Corrientes fucked me. So everybody has it? Those people don't know me. That's why they talk bullshit. If they knew me, they'd know I mean no harm. Do you believe them? -No. -I mean it. Do you? I said no. Are you OK? You know what pisses me off the most? That my mom will hear about all this. -How? -She worries a lot. How does she find out? Gossip flies. She asked me if I was OK the other day. I'm gonna save money and get the hell out of here. What's that? What? That. This? It's from a kick I got. Does it hurt? Get over here. Hi, Roc?o. What's up with that? Leave it. I know. I don't know what it is. I'm scared it might keep growing and stand out. What a bummer. I don't think it's that. It's just... I went to his house for the first time. -What an ass. -It's done. He asked me... and I was ashamed to ask him to wear one. -You're an asshole, Dar?o. -It's a drag. What a bummer. And it really hurt. I don't know what to do now. Stop thinking about it. It's all on your mind. He asked me whether the kids had girlfriends. That son of a bitch asked me whether they had girlfriends. What a gossip. I told him, "They're too busy. They're artists." Who does he think he is? He thinks he can ask you anything 'cause he has a store. Did you buy these bananas? -Yes. -Apparently, they're plantains. Plantains? Since when? The guy across the street told me the other day. "Madam, those are not bananas. They're plantains." I paid the same. -You're with Iris? -Yeah. I was gonna ask you to buy something, but forget it. -OK. -Tell us what happened then. Nothing. I took my things and-- He made a comment about her and the other girl. Well, it's true. She's been hanging out with that girl. It's not because of that. You know she shows herself. But the other stuff is serious. It's serious. That's all I'm saying. Holler if you need anything, Susi. -OK. -We'll go outside. -I'll take your smokes. -OK. I'll be right with you. -A beer would be nice. -I'll bring one. -What's up with you? -Nothing. -What are you hiding? Show me. -It's nothing. Let me see. -Look at this. -Leave it. That's infected. Let me see. Keep your mouth straight. Let me see. You have to disinfect that. Wash it up with soap and water. -We'll see the doctor. -No, we won't. We will. Stop kissing Roc?o. -That dog's full of germs. -You're such a drag. Enough, Dar?o. Come, look. -Who's that? -I don't know. Where did it come from? They sent it to me. -Isn't that Nico? -Yeah. -Look at Toro. -What's he doing there? They're disgusting... sending that to you. -It's Pablo! -Pablo! What's Pablo doing? No way. What a bunch of jackasses. -Isn't that Ale? -It's Ale. -What is he doing there? -So out of place. Nico's such a jerk. Are you OK? What's with the video, Ale? What video? This is Cinnamon. Hi, Cinnamon. So? Can we be here? Yeah. Forgive the mess. Would you like something to drink? Water? Soda? Something like that? I'm good. This is a picture of me when I was a kid. How old were you? One and a half or two. I was learning to walk. Do you like dogs? Um... so-so. Wait... your dog is on the sofa. What's that noise? That's my neighbor. He doesn't like watching. He doesn't like dykes. Come. Where to? Not far away. Seriously, come. Nobody's here. My mom's working. She won't come. She asked how long we've been friends. I hope we start soon. These pills I'm taking make me sleepy. Are you OK? Yeah, but I feel sleepy. He called me? What happened? Let's go. Where's Dar?o? Find him. Hi, hon. What do you want? I'm coming, Mat?as. Hold on. No, thanks. Something happened to you? No. You? No. I'm really well. Are you mad? No. It's just we went to Traumatic yesterday. And? I saw you dancing and kissing a lot of people. Well, yeah. So what? Does it make you mad? No. It just got me thinking. I was surprised. Why? 'Cause... I don't know... I think that maybe what they say about you is true, if you behave like that. What's that they say? It doesn't matter. What pisses me off the most is that you come after me and tease me, and I don't understand why if you're with everybody else. That's so much bullshit. I'm not coming after you or teasing you. I could leave you alone right now if you want. No. See how you are? You're talking bull. So what? Is it true you're with people for money? No. You're so clueless. What's it to you what I do with my life? Seriously. It's not that I think it's wrong. I just think it's not safe. Safe? You're just like everybody else, Iris. I mean it. I've heard this safe / unsafe bullshit so many times. Or about health. What's health? What the hell is health? That's a made-up thing for dummies. What a shitty word. You would've totally freaked if my old friends from Traumatic had touched you. They used to bite their tongues and pass their blood to others while making out. They got really scared. They were tired of prejudices. Fucking stuck-ups. -That's awful. -So what? They deserved it. Those stuck-ups, always with the right to be safe and healthy. -Hi. Everything OK? -Hi. Yeah. Mart?n, I don't ever wanna see you with that curly-haired chick again... They told me you're with that one. Getting high, it's always the same with you! Mart?n! Are you listening? Your clothes are disgusting. Tidy up your room, you junkie! Iris, please come-- Iris, please come over. The principal saw the video and Ale is having a nervous breakdown. Come, please. What do you prefer? -I'm asking you... -What? -What do you prefer? I mean it. -Back off. Come on. Seriously. I'm getting expelled. Who cares about school? It's useless. What matters is what you prefer. Getting HIV... and spending your life with treatment... -Stop it! -Or... Or getting married to Magal?... having... lots of kids... and... fucking once a year? That's not fair. What do you prefer? Getting caught fucking in a video that goes viral or never seeing Renata again? You're mean. It would be awful not seeing her again. It cancels out, then. Let's see there. Let's take a look. Could you be gentle, please? You're such a wimp. Let's see. Wait. What? Look at me. You're a pretty boy. How's it going? What do you mean? -Are you a regular here? -I come every now and then. Uh-huh. -Are you single? -Yeah, no rush. Wow. What are you into? Taking or giving? -Active or passive? Versatile? -It depends. What do you like? Want me to do you a favor? Get out of here! You're gross. Stop it! Back off. You didn't tell me about the message. What message? The message. Give me back my key! Give it back! It's just a friend of your dad saw you. They work at the energy company. He saw you fucking on a bus. Gosh... That's so not true. Get out of here. It's always the same with you. -You promise some-- -Hush, the kids. Get out. I've had it with you. You always tell me the same. Did your mother find out? I don't know. Everybody did. I bet she did. Get out now. Get out of my house. Leave and don't come back. I don't wanna see you on my street. -The kids are listening. -I don't care! The kids don't give a damn about you and your last name. They don't want it anymore. Are you okay, Mom? Yeah. Just play some music, honey. I'll hold you Though you can't feel me I'll kiss you Though you won't kiss me -Hi. -Hi. Hi, how are you? Fine. Everything OK? -Hi. -Hi. Come. People. Iris. -Hey, what's up? -Renata, wait. -Let's talk. -I'll call you later. -Let's talk. -I'll call you in a minute. Gotta take care of something. -Let's talk. -Maxi, I mean it. Give me a minute and I'll call you. -What a crazy whore. -Hey, don't say that. -What are you doing, asshole? -Come. -What is it? -What? -Are you scared? -No. I have this, just in case. What? It's worse to walk around with that. It could go wrong. What could go wrong? What? Come. Come. What is it? Nothing. -Are you OK? -Yeah. -Something happened? -No. -What's up, Braian? -Hey, Renata. How ya doing? -Wait. -We were looking for you. Let go. You've been disappeared. -I'm not. -What's going on with you? -You don't say hi anymore. -Let's talk later. You're ripped. We'll talk later. Wait, let her go! -You wanna run away? -Let her go! I'm not playing... You're ripped. -We'll talk later. -I want what's mine. -Deal. We'll talk. -I want what's mine. -Let her go. -Back off. Fuck! Motherfucker! Hey! -Who is it? -Romi, open up. -Open up. -Rena? Go. Go with your friends. Go, go. Front... Left... Right and then you go... What happened? -What happened? -I don't know. Iris, are you OK? Iris! Iris. Iris. Say, Iris. -What does your name mean? -I don't know. Noem? likes it very much. She's planning on naming her baby Iris. -You don't know? -No. Maybe it's got something to do with the eye. It's unusual. Coral used to be unusual, but they're using it a lot nowadays. -And also... -Aunt, stop bugging her. Let's go. OK, let's sing the "Happy Birthday." Come on! Time to blow the candles! Sofi! Come over here! And? There was nobody. -What's he doing here? -I don't know. Again? Where did she go? To R., a beacon to the One Thousand
