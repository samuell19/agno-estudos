Belva! Are you checking on Faye? She didn't walk me to the store yesterday. I know Mrs. Hamill, you've already told me twice! And the smell coming out of her room can gag a maggot! I know, I know, just let me do my job, okay? Mm-hmm. Faye! Faye! You in there? Hey Faye! The neighbors are complaining! You gotta start taking your trash out more often. Faye! Faye, I'm starting to get worried. Nobody's seen you for a couple of days. Old Mrs. Hamill, she's driving me nuts wanting you out here. Faye! I'm going to come in now. Okay? This living like an animal has got to stop, Faye! Jesus Christ! She is definitely a fighter. It's amazing she survived at all. I don't hold out much hope for her to come out of the coma though. Heartbeat is strong. We'll just keep her on the iv and keep her comfortable, for however long it takes nature to take its course. Of course, doctor. Thank you. Not now, Charlie, mamma's tired, just five more minutes. Mrs. King? Dr. Armstrong, she spoke. Who? Mrs. King, the coma patient. I was just bathing her and she began to speak. What did she say? Was she lucid? No, I don't think so, because she called me Charlie. It was more like muttering in her sleep, but in case she woke up I thought it was best to have you here. Yeah, it may have been nothing, just a side effect of her condition. But in the event she comes around, I did want to be present, you're right. Mrs. King, can you hear me? Hey, what the hell? Of course I can hear you Hi, Mrs. King, my name is- - who are you people? Calm down, Mrs. King, I'm trying to tell you. My name is Dr. Armstrong, you're in hospice. And this is your attending nurse, Linda dermont. What am I doing in hospice? You were in the hospital for the first few days, then they transferred you here. Days? Yes, you've been here for the rest of the week. Oh, god. Who's been taking care of my cat, Charlie? What? Say it! I'm afraid your animal passed ma'am. It was the smell of the cat that caused your landlord to enter your apartment and find you. Poor Charlie. What happened to me? Why am I here? You suffered a coma. From a condition called alcoholic encephalopathy. It's a build up of ammoniac in the blood. Apparently from prolonged, excessive use of alcohol. Prolonged, excessive use of alcohol, yeah, that's an understatement, doc. But you're awake now! That's a good sign. It's a step in the right direction. Let's see if we can make you more comfortable. Can you try and raise the bed? Sure. There you go, that's better. I'd like to start off by seeing if we can get a little food into you. Bring some of your strength back. Whatever you say, doc. I'll be back to check on you later. Linda will handle everything. I'll see you when I'm on my rounds. Okay. God damn, I could use a cigarette. They're not being completely honest with you. You know that, don't you? What are you, one of the resident care takers here? No. I'm only here when someone is on their way out, shall we say. You see, Faye, these are your final hours. I've heard of budget cutbacks before, but this is insane. I can't be going home already, I just woke up. I believe what my coadjutor is trying to relay, Mrs. King, is that, you're not going to recover from this, and unfortunately one of US will be guiding you to the afterlife. What is this? Some kind of corn ball intervention? An intervention would do you little good now, don't you think, Faye? This is the end of your mortal life. All that remains is to determine where your soul is bound. Get the hell out of my room! Just woke up and already in a mood, Mrs. King? I'm sorry, but the doctor insists you try and eat something. I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to that pale bastard. I don't think I know who you're talking about. I'm sorry. I'm not really that hungry but I could sure use a cigarette. I'm sorry, Mrs. King, but there's no smoking at hospice, not even for the staff. So, there's no cigarettes to be found around here. But please, try and eat something, it will make the doctor happy. I'm not making any promises, but I'll give it a shot. I appreciate the effort. Thank you. So life didn't turn out the best for you. Did it, Faye? I really don't understand the necessity of these training exercises anyway. Isn't your primary concern disaster relief? Oh, sweetie, come on. I told you this a million times before. We've gotta be prepared for anything, that includes military actions. Yeah, I know, but, I just wish you'd be doing something less dangerous. I hate the guns. Oh, you'd have me retire if you could right now, wouldn't you? Well, yeah, maybe you thought, should think about staying home and just doing the one job. The bottom line right now, sweetie, is that our son's college isn't cheap, ya know? Yeah. Come here. Listen, everything is going to be okay. Enjoy everything and let it happen. Because I'm in the reserves, we're doing a lot better than other people right now. You're gonna have me all to yourself, 24/7 soon enough, and then you're just going to be begging for a weekend to yourself. That is never going to happen, because I'm never going to get tired of spending time with you. You sure? Yeah, so can you just like call in sick just this weekend? And maybe go next month when you're doing something less dangerous, like soup dishing exercises? Oh, sweetie. Do you have any idea how many soldiers are having this same conversation with their husbands and wives? If that was the case, there would be no reserves. I know, and I can't speak for the rest. I'll just do my best to try to convince you to stay. Yeah? Yeah. And how's that? Shut up. I'm going to be back, I promise. Okay? You better. I love you. Disturbing and sad news out of fort Luke. Though full details are not released yet, the military has verified reports from earlier today that a soldier has been killed during routine maneuvers on base. Oh, no! The military maintains this was an unfortunate accident and not an act of terror. Full details will be made public, including the name of the fallen soldier, once their family has been notified of the accident. Our thoughts and our prayers are with the fallen soldier's family. No, John no! Where's my husband, John? Where is he? Mrs. King? Yes, I'm Mrs. King, goddammit! Where's John? I'm sorry, Mrs. King. There's been an accident. Oh god, no, John! Oh god, no, John! I'm afraid this doesn't get any easier. Let's get her inside. Okay. I just don't understand how this could have happened. John said it was target practice. If it was just a routine exercise, how could he get hurt? Target practice is a very routine exercise. But we do use live rounds. So, we have to be really careful. Another soldier, he was a new recruit. His gun jammed. So John came over to help him clear it out. During that process, the gun malfunctioned and went off. The bullet ricocheted off the wall and struck John in the head. John was killed instantly. Mrs. King, if there is anything, anything at all that we can do to make this difficult time easier, just let US know, we would be glad to help. What my lieutenant was trying to say- - my son. Mrs. King, what do you mean by your son? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me, our son Todd. He comes home from college in a few days. And this news is going to destroy him. If there is any way that the army could be here, to help me break the news to him. It would, it would let Todd know that his father's life meant something. That he was important. Mrs. King, I understand that but the military doesn't usually- - of course, Mrs. King. Whatever it is you need. Just let me know when and where and I'll be there. Faye. You had no blame in what happened to John. Of course not, I know that. It was an accident. You had no way of knowing that he was going off to die that weekend. Did you, Faye? No, how could I have known? What do you mean? What do you think I mean, Faye? There's no way I could have known. And yet, you tried so hard to keep him from going. Why did you do that? Because I, because- - had a feeling? Maybe an intuition that John shouldn't go to guard that weekend? That maybe something bad might happen. Perhaps if you'd only tried just a little bit harder. What the hell do you want from me? I'm sorry, if you're up to trying to eat something, I can take it away. I just thought maybe you wanted a straw or something, that's all. I'm so sorry. I could have sworn there was somebody else there. I'm sorry, maybe I'm not ready to eat. I should just get some rest. Yes, ma'am, you go try and get some rest. Thank you. Oh, come on in, it's open. Oh, crap! Good evening, Mrs. King. Afternoon, Mr. Paul. What are you doing here? You know, you can just call me Richard if you like Mrs. King, and, isn't today the 22nd? If you say so, but why are you here? The funeral is not going to be for- - Todd, doesn't he come home today? Oh, crap! How could I have forgotten that? I'm sorry, I've been so out of sorts. I was just napping on the couch when you rang the doorbell. It's understandable, Mrs. King. You've been through a lot these last couple of days. Gosh, I'm sorry, I, I've been splitting my time between Todd's room and the couch. I just can't bring myself to sleep in our bed. But please, sit down. Have a seat. There is sodas in the fridge if you get thirsty and I really need to freshen up, because, yeah, I look bad. Of course, Mrs. King. I'd be happy to wait here and thank you for the offer, but I'm fine. Oh, you're very welcome and if you change your mind, just go ahead and help yourself. I'll be right back. Thank you. What the heck? Oh, Mrs. King, you poor woman. Uh, hello? Hi, you must be Todd. Yeah, I'm Todd, that's right. Who are you? Where's my parents? I'm sorry, I'm Richard Paul- - oh yeah, you're my dad's lieutenant in the reserves. Yeah, that's right. You know what? You mom just stepped down to freshen up a little bit. I guess she thought she had more time before you got here. She had been napping on the couch when I rang the doorbell. The couch, that's weird. She'd never let dad or I get away with that. So, where's dad? You know what? He's not here. So, why are you here? No, wait, don't tell me! Dad is getting some kind of commendation. He always tells me- - Todd. If you work really hard, the right people will notice. - And eventually, with time- - Todd! You can just move up. That's what he always says: I do it, and you should too, son. Todd! There's been an accident. What? I didn't want to tell you like this. Your mom thought it would be better if I was here and the two of US told you together. What are you talking about? Where's my dad? There was an accident on the base, Todd. I'm sorry, but- no! No! He's gone, Todd. Oh, no! Toddie! Oh, honey. Mom, dad is, dad is dead! Dad, he's gone! I know, baby. Oh my god! Richie, what are you doing here? I thought you were out of the country. I was, belva called me and told me that she'd found you unconscious. And that were in the hospital. By the time I got home, they had moved you here. I swear, that woman is more of a mother hen, than an actual landlord. Well, I'm glad she is. You're the only family I've got left. I had to come back. Thanks for sneaking this in. Oh, I didn't have to sneak in, it's plastic. It's allowed. Hide it, before the nurse comes back. Thank you. You're welcome. Regardless of how you got here, it's really good to see you. I was actually just dreaming about you and how you came into my life. That is kind of funny. I was just thinking about that too. Your dad was good man, Todd. He was one of the best under my command. I know he was. I just can't believe he's actually gone, you know? I thought being in the reserves meant he'd be safe. That something like this just couldn't happen. I know, and I am sorry. You know, ever since the accident, every morning I wake up, and I hope this was all just bad dream. I've never lost one of my people before. And losing someone like your dad. Well, it's been a powerful blow to all of US who knew him. I just don't know what I'm going to do now that he's gone. And I can expect the world feels the same, emptiness. Well, I need to get back to base. And you get in there and take care of your mother. Yeah, you're right. That's what dad would expect me to do. You know what? Here's my card. I'm going to write my cellphone number on the back of it. If you need anything, you call me. You got it? I got it. Thank you. You're welcome, Todd. You're going to be okay. You're a good man, like your dad. Say goodnight to your mom for me. I will. You take care of yourself too. Yeah, I will. Oh, what are you doing, Richard? You're getting yourself in deep here, mister. Captain Daniels is right. You're just going to make this harder on yourself. You know you can't be doing that. Doing what? Showing some compassion to a family that has just lost a loved one? No. Showing compassion is an admiral quality. But you can't get too personally involved. You're young and- - sir, I'm 30 and I've made it to the rank of first lieutenant as well. Okay, let me finish. So, you're young and this is the first time you've ever lost one of your own. So, each time that you have any interaction with a family member, it multiplies your grief by every time that you deal with them. What are you suggesting? That I don't follow through? That I don't keep my word to that woman? No, of course not. Do what you said. But use this as a learning experience. This is the first time that you've ever been on one of these calls with the family. And if the army has taught me anything, this will definitely not be your last. Yeah. But you have to understand that you need to distance yourself. Or the sorrow that you have will be way too much to bear. Yeah. It's all right, lieutenant Paul, you're one of the good ones. You'll be all right. Well, I'm really glad to see you too. Awake that is. I've been sitting here longer than I can say, watching you sleep. That's creepy. It's good to know, some things don't change. Bedridden or not, you don't hesitate to say what you're thinking. Belva tell you about Charlie? Yeah, actually I helped her Bury him. Next to that big tree in the back of the complex courtyard. Oh, thank you. He's gonna like that. When he was strong enough to go outside, he used to like sitting up in that tree, watching those birds. He wasn't fast enough to catch them, but he sure liked watching them. Are you okay? Do you need me to call the nurse? No, I'm fine. I'd feel much better if I had a cigarette. Uh-uh. I thought you were giving those up anyway. And you know. Speaking of things I thought you were giving up. Belva and I cleaned out your apartment. Oh, crap! Oh crap is right, ma! That place looked like a liquor store, except all the bottles were empty. What can I say? It helps me sleep. Yeah, well, this time your sleep was almost permanent. I know. I tried to quit. I even cut back a little, but the clearer my head got, the clearer the memories of John and Todd got and it just, it's unbearable, the heartache. So, I couldn't help it. I just wanted to drown my sorrows. Numb my feelings in the booze. You gotta stop this, ma. I can't keep losing everyone that I care about. You can't drink yourself to death. I just couldn't deal with that, after the loss of my parents, and then Todd. God, that's so awful. I can barely stand the memory of it. I know. Phoenix memorial, third floor. How can I help you? One moment, I'll transfer you. Hello, how can I help you? Yes, we're here to see Todd king. Okay, let me see if he's ready. Oh no, I'm sorry, the doctor hasn't yet released him to see visitors. So, if you just want to have a seat right over there, I'll let you know as soon as he's available. This is the only time that we were told that he would be available to be seen. And we both took off time to be here. We don't get to see him that often. Why do we have to wait? It's okay. It won't be that long, right? No, it won't be but a moment. He's been in there for quite a while now. Okay, come on. Thank you. I don't understand why we have to wait. I don't understand either. But we've got to trust the doctors. Why? They don't know anything they're useless. He should be at home with US. Not with a bunch of people who don't really care about him. Richie, I know you're upset. And this shouldn't be happening. Not to US. Not after everything we've had to endure. It's not their fault. You know if, if Todd wasn't here, we would have lost him to pneumonia weeks ago. Maybe so, but I'm not sure this is what's best for him anymore. Dr bullard, how is he? Can we see him now? He's weak, but he can see visitors for a bit. What about his lungs? How are his lungs? I'm afraid he's still retaining fluids. We just don't know exactly how to treat these new drug resistant strains of aids. When's the last time you got tested, son? Just last week. I've been going to an anonymous clinic every couple of weeks, just like you suggested. This is crap! You shouldn't have. You should be able to go to your own doctor, you shouldn't have to hide! I'm sorry! I hate the military! I hate it! I'm sorry, Mrs. King. I know this is hard, but we've got to manage the best we can with the circumstances we've been given. Maybe some day, things will be different. I know, I'm sorry. But we've got to survive today. I know, you're right. This is about Todd. Why don't you take a minute, splash some water on your face and we'll go see him. Okay, thank you. I'll be right back. Hi honey. Ma? Richie is here with me. Hey buddy. Dad's grave? We went yesterday and put fresh flowers on it. I know how important it is to you. We won't miss a Sunday, I promise. I'll be home soon. Makes me feel better, that you guys will come visit me when I'm- - Don't say that. You have to hang on. They are going to figure out a way to treat this. You'll see. Todd, you've got to take it easy. You are not getting enough oxygen. Speak a little at a time. Richie and I were talking, since your condition is not changing, we thought maybe we would get you some in home care and take you back home with US. - Faye. - Sound good? That's not a good idea. It's critical that we keep him here until we can control the pneumonia. I wanna go home. I know you do, baby. And we want you there too. We'll figure something out. Todd, I need you to rest some more. Can I speak to you in the hall for a minute? Sure. We will be right back. I'm going home! Soon, Todd, soon, you'll see. Look, I know you two want to comfort him, but I think it's best that we keep him here, so he can get the best possible care. Yeah, but we could get him a nurse at home. Faye. His condition is so frail right now, he would not survive that trip. Look, everybody knows he's gonna die and there's nothing anybody can do about it. Richard! But at least he can do it at home with US, the people who love him. Not here surrounded by a bunch of strangers. We're doing everything we can for him, but his condition is gradually getting worse. If we can get the fluid off his lungs, I'd be happy to send him home with you. But I strongly advise against it. I wasn't exaggerating when I said he would not make the trip home. Dr. Bullard, he is flat-lining again. Go to the waiting room. I can't have you in there when we're trying to do our jobs. Yeah, but he could die and we should be in there. Mrs. King, for Todd's sake! But he's coming home with US! Oh god! Dr. Bullard? I'm sorry, Faye. There was nothing we could do. No. No. Toddie! Oh, no! I just don't know what I have to live for anymore. What is left for me here? I'm still here. I know you are. I'm sorry, Richard. You just have no idea what it's like for me to have to get up every single day and deal with that pain. I just want it to be over. Don't I know, ma? You know, there's something I need to tell you. Something that I've, I've hung on to, because it was, well, it was just too much for me to share. But, I really think it's you knew. Shortly after we lost, Todd, I was gonna end it. I had a gun in my mouth and everything. I was gonna pull the trigger. And then you called, and then you made me promise to come over the next day. Hello? Hi ya, Richie, honey. How ya holding up? Not so good, ma. How are you doing? About the same. I don't know what I would've done or how I would've gotten through the day without you. You know he loved you, right? Yeah, I know. It was as mutual as it gets. So I gotta take care of you now, all right? 'Cause that's what Todd would've wanted. Just like you did for US, when we lost John. I don't know, ma. I just, I don't think I can keep going on. Sure you can. Listen to me, you have to! You're all I've got left in this world now, Richie. Without you by my side, I haven't got a chance. Can you, uh, can you come by the house tomorrow, please? I've got something I want to show you. I just, I don't know if I can. Sure you can. Listen to me, you have to! You're all I've got left in this world now, Richie. Well, I'll see what I can do. I gotta go. No, Richie. You gotta promise me first! Promise me you'll be here tomorrow, it's important. Okay, okay. Okay fine. I promise. Thank you. I'll see you in the morning, Richie. Try and get some sleep. And remember, I love you. I love you, ma. Goodnight. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. If you hadn't done that, I- - you never told me this before. There was never a point. And what's the point now? To let you see how important you are. If you hadn't stopped me that night, I wouldn't be here now. Sounds like some kind of emotional ploy to get me to stop drinking, right? Well, uh, let's just call it motivation to get better. Have you had a nice visit? Uh-oh, warden is here to kick me out. Now, don't be like that, Mr. Paul. I'm just doing what's best for Mrs. King's health. And doctor's orders are 30 minutes Max. She needs her rest if she's gonna get out of here any time soon. I know, Linda, I was just joking. I will see you tomorrow. You keep getting better, okay? And I'll see you then. Thanks for taking care of her. She's a lot more special than you can imagine. I can imagine. You have a good night, Mr. Paul, and we'll see you tomorrow. You too, Linda. Goodnight, ma. Night, Richie. I'll see you tomorrow. Now, how are you feeling after a nap and a visit? Oh, god, overwhelmed! Okay, not the answer I was expecting. I was hoping for hungry. Well, I could use a cig- - Cigarette? Yeah! Yes, Mrs. King, I know, but it ain't gonna happen. How about some warm broth? It will help you get your strength back. Well, it's not a smoke, but I'll give it a try. Fantastic, I'll be back in a few minutes. Thank you. It was nice of Richard to come all the way back from Europe to check in on you. Oh, god. You again. So, where's your fancy friend? He's never far behind. I'm here, Faye. Oh, god. I was just being sarcastic. I wasn't really asking for you. Yeah, I realize that. But you need to understand, our business here isn't done. How does what the soldier told you make you feel? Where do you jerks get off questioning me about my family? Richie is a good kid. And Todd? Was he a good kid as well? And were you okay with their relationship? So tell me more about the movie, was it any good? Well, good is a relative term, I guess. Yeah, Todd hated it. I think hated is a bit harsh. I just like a little bit of dialog between explosions, is all. Okay, if you say so. Wow, since Todd and I have pretty much the same taste, it's probably not a movie I want to go see. That would be putting it mildly. Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to change the subject. There's something I wanted to ask you about. Yeah, sure, mom. What's that? Well, you're graduating in a couple months. Have you given any thought to where you want to live when you get back? I hadn't really thought about it. I was just concentrating on graduating. And then, I thought I'd come back home and get settled in and just go from there. Well, you know I'd love to have you here, but maybe it's time the two of you thought about moving in together. Mom! Mom! Well, come on. It's obvious how you two feel about each other. You know what, maybe I should just go. Richie! Mom. Todd. Okay, now that we've all established who we are. Can we just calm down for a second? Please! Yeah. Yes. I guess so. Thank you. Mom, please don't. Oh, give me a break. Just hear me out. Do we really have to do this? You know, when we lost John, and we all lost John. You became a really big part of our lives. I didn't think I was ever going to see Todd smile again. And then when you started hanging around, the light came back into his eyes and this place, oh come on, it actually feels like a home again, doesn't it? But ma, it's not like rich and I can go out and get- - what? Married? Maybe not now. All I'm saying is you're my boys and I love you. You don't have to stand on ceremony around me. Life is too precious to not be who you are and with the one you love. That's all I'm saying. I love you, guys. You're family, that's all that matters. Wow, I'm totally embarrassed. I don't know what to say. You know this is really hard for me to talk about, Faye, but- - call me, ma, like he does. You're family now. Okay, ma. Anyway, like I was saying. This is really hard for me to talk about. It's not something my parents would have approved of. Rich, you really don't have to do this. Yeah Todd, I really do think this is something I need to say. My parents are gone now. After I lost them, all I had was my career. That is until you guys. Being in the military makes it really hard, but knowing we have your approval, that really means a lot to me. Oh, Todd, you can stop giving me the stink eye for outing you in front of your boyfriend. I've known about you since your first boyfriend in junior high school. Mom! And your father knew, too! You, my dear, are about as subtle as an army tank. Oh my god, mother! I think John would be happy for the both of you. You know he's always liked you very much, Richie. I think I'm gonna be sick. Oh, don't worry about Todd. I'm sorry, he'll be back in a few minutes. In the meantime, you want a glass of wine? Yeah, you know what? I think I could really use a drink right about now. Grab that. Oh, yeah! Excellent. There we go. I'm making a mess. Uh, to family! To family! Of course I was okay with their relationship. Those two boys had a love most people never get a chance at. I see. So you had no problem that their behavior went against nature? Against nature, my ass. To hell with you! Faye, there is no reason to get upset. To hell with you too! Who do you guys think you are, coming in here and trampling on the memories of my family? Calm down, Faye. I realize you must feel guilty for failing Todd as a parent. But this isn't about him, it's about you. Guilty? Well, yeah, of course. That's why you're behaving like this, isn't it? If you hadn't condoned their deviant behavior, Todd might still be here right now. Richie didn't give Todd aids he must have got it when he was in college or earlier on! He actually did. Well, then you know! You know it wasn't Richie that ended Todd's life! That was never a question, Faye. What we're discussing here is the guilt that you have over that. If you and John had put an end to this early on, this never would have happened. Todd's guilt or innocence was never in question here. We're just trying to come to terms with your failure of him as a parent. So you can release that guilt and move on. Good lord, Mrs. King. I was only gone for a moment. What happened to you? I'm sorry, Linda. I don't think I can eat right now. I think I'm losing my mind. Well, that's just too bad, cause you're going to have to try. Thank you. But, they were just here when I- - I'm sorry, Mrs. King, I'm not going to hear of it! You didn't eat anything yesterday, and it's my job to make sure you get well. Mr. Paul is depending on me. And you told me you were going to try, so I'm going to hold you to it. Fine. That's more like it. You're not really going to sit there and watch me eat, are you? Well, that's not exactly why I'm staying here. It just seems that every time I leave the room, something happens to get you upset. So yes, I'm staying here while you eat, but not necessarily to keep an eye on you. You don't think I hallucinate just because you're sitting there? Yes, if that's what it is, that's what I think. Because it never seems to happen until I leave the room. Well, either this is really good broth or I'm really hungry. It's probably the latter, because it's just out of a can. Okay. So you want to tell me what you think you're seeing whenever I leave the room? Not really. It might help. I doubt it. Come on, Mrs. King. Let me guess, you're going to some kind of night school to become a psychiatrist, right? No, that's not it. I'm very happy in my chosen career field. I just know that it helps to talk about things sometimes. Yeah, I doubt you'd believe the crazy stuff that I've been seeing. Faye, you really think doing the kind of work I do, that I would be that easy to surprise? I suppose. Come on, humor me, please. I think we both know, I've just been hallucinating. Perhaps. You do have a pretty good amount of drugs pouring through your system right now. So there's a great chance of that. What else could it be, right? Oh, I don't know. Others have told me things that have stayed here before. You mean people that have died here? Some, and others that have come pretty close, but have stayed here for a while. But regardless, they've told me that they've seen things. Yeah, but what kind of things? I'd like you to tell me what you're seeing because I don't want to cloud your memories. You see, they say near death experiences can cause our minds to start seeing things we weren't able to see before. And you came pretty close. Any chance I could get a cigarette out of this little case study of yours? Not one. I was afraid you'd say that, but I thought I'd ask anyway. So what is it you want to know? So, what is it that you're seeing? It's not really a what, it's a whom. So you're seeing someone, what do they look like? Two someones. One is this touchy-feely hippie kind of guy. And the other one looks like a big, black undertaker. I see. The hippie guy is kind of a cross between a touchy-feely Mr. Rogers and like a prosecutor. A criminal prosecutor. And the undertaker? Well, the first guy really gives me the creeps. The undertaker, he's fine. He is precise and to the point and I think we both know I'm just hallucinating, so- - so? It's not like they are here to take me to the afterlife or anything like that. Is that why they say they're here? Interesting. Maybe they are, maybe they're not. What's that supposed to mean? You're not holding out on me, are you, Linda? No, I'm not holding out on you. And yes, you're not completely out of the woods. But that's not what I was, that's not what I was talking about. What I meant to say is that I think I may know a way that we can find out. I don't, what do you mean? Find out if they are hallucinations. You mean find out if I'm crazy, right? No, Mrs. King, we're gonna, I'm trying to find out if these are hallucinations. And how are we gonna do that? Well, I just lost my brother recently. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I'm dealing with it. Do you want me to ask them about your brother? Yes. Seriously? Yes, if these are just hallucinations, they won't know anything. Okay, how did your brother die? Well, let's see if you can tell me that in the morning. Are you all done here? Yeah, I'm finished with the soup. But I think there is more than one person in this room that's crazy. Well, tonight is your chance to prove that. Good night, Mrs. King. Good night, Linda, thank you. Well, you just keep turning up like a bad penny, huh? 'Till my job is done. I know I'm hallucinating but this imaginary water is good and cold. I know it's hard to wrap your mind around, Faye, but we're really here for you. Yeah, here to put me on trial for what you view are the short comings of my life. I didn't say that. Good god! I've had a crap life and I'm at the end of it and you two show up and want to pass judgment on me? Piss off! We're not judging you, Faye. Well, it sure feels like it. We're just reviewing the events of your life. So you can let go of any guilt that you might feel from them. And move on to where you belong. Relieve my guilt, for what? Not trying hard enough to stop my husband going out on guard, so he wouldn't get shot? Or having my gay son pretend he's not, so he wouldn't die of aids? Yeah, something like that. Well, you're wasting your time there son, because I don't feel guilty about those things. Does it kill me, that I lost them both? Hell yes! Do I miss them, every single day? Hell yes! Do I wish things would have been different? Yeah, I bet you know the answer now, huh? But honestly, I don't feel guilty. If anyone's to blame for this, it's you two. You certainly are spirited when you're angry. Oh, so you think this is funny, huh? Well, if you two supernatural jerks are real, you must get a real kick out of meddling in other people's lives. Oh, Terrence, why did you choose the life that you did? You could have been anything that you wanted to be, but you had to be a gangster, didn't you? Terrence dermont. Hello? You have a collect call from- - Terrence dermont. Will you accept the charges? I will. Please hold and I will connect your call. Hey, Linda. Listen I tried to reach mom, but I got no answer. I'm down at the county. What have you been busted for this time, Terrence? Possession, but I swear, it wasn't mine. That cop put it in my pocket oh, Terrence. What are we going to do with you? You really think we'll believe anything, don't you? Sis, it's not like that. I'm keeping it 100 with you, like I said I would. But it's my squad. I think they're after me. They paid that cop off to get me locked up, so they can get at me. Stop it, Terrence! You can't reach your mother because she is in the hospital having her gallbladder removed. And if you were any kind of son, you would know that. But you don't give a damn about anyone but yourself. Sis, don't get mad and hang up on me, I'm in trouble. I need you! I'm not mad, Terrence. I'm tired. We're tired! We're all tired of your lies. I'm not lying! I swear on our mother's life, I'm not. I'm telling you the truth! Now you've gone too far! Especially now while she's in the hospital having surgery. Or did you forget that already? I meant no disrespect. I just need you to believe me. I'm telling you the truth. I wish I could too, Terrence. But I'll tell you what. Why don't you think of a better story to tell your mother when she gets out in a couple of days? And maybe she'll come down and bail your sorry ass outta jail. Bye, Terrence. No, sis! Sis! No, I swear, sis! Hello? Is this miss Linda dermont? Yes, this is she, but let me stop you right there. Because I'm on my way out for work and I don't have time for a solicitation call. Mrs. Dermont, this isn't a solicitation call. I'm calling from the maricopa county jail, in regards to your brother Terrence. We've been unable to reach your mother this morning. Do you know how we can contact her? As I told my bum brother, Terrence, last night, our mother is in the hospital having surgery and isn't reachable at this time. Furthermore, I don't care what crap Terrence has gotten himself into this time. He can wait until she's available her own damn self! I don't think you understand, Mrs. Dermont. What I don't understand is how a jackass like Terrence can have someone calling from a facility where he is locked up on his behalf. Is that good use of my tax dollars? He can just wait until- - There was an altercation last night, Mrs. Dermont Terrence was stabbed and I'm afraid he didn't make it. Oh my god! Oh my god, Terrence! If only I had listened to you that night, Terrence. If only I wasn't so angry, baby brother. It might have not changed what happened to you, but at least you would've known that I cared. Well, looks like somebody is back on solid food. Oh, you can blame that on Linda. She gave me some broth last night. And I woke up this morning with an appetite. Well, I'll have to remember to thank her. Where is she anyway? It's before visiting hours and she is not guarding the door. You're safe for now. The girl that's filling in for her said she's gonna be late, she didn't say why though. So, what are you doing here so early anyway? Well, maybe without her bird dogging me, I can get away with longer than a 30 minute visit. I doubt it. They've got eyes and ears everywhere around here. Well, then I guess I should just get right to it. There is something I really need to talk to you about. This sounds important. It is actually, you see, um, well, I've decided to leave the military and move back here. So, I will be home full time. Richie, you can't quit your career, you love it there. You're not doing this just for me? Because if you are, I'm fine. Well, first off, we know that's clearly not true and while that is a contributing factor, that's not it. See, since I've been back I've just, I've been looking at my life and I just realized it's time. As long as it's something that you really want, and you're not doing this for anybody else except yourself. It is, ma. Actually, my decision goes back to something we were talking about yesterday. Really, how so? Well, remember how I told you that making me promise to come over the next day saved my life that night? Yeah, I don't think I could forget it if I tried. Well, it's what happened when I came over that day that gave me the strength to go on. And it's, it's even effecting my decision to leave the military now. Oh, come on in. Hi ya, Richie. I'm really glad you're here. I, I've got something I wanna show you, but I need to ask you something first. Okay. Did, um, cid Todd ever talk about John having cancer? No, he, he never mentioned it. Well, it was right around when he was in high school. Um, John started having groin pain and we took him to the doctor and he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Oh my god! That had to be awful for all you guys. Yeah, it was. But we got through it together. But it had a profound effect on Todd. Why did it effect Todd so much? Well, we had him tested, just to be safe. And he didn't have it, thank god. But it turned out he was genetically predisposed to developing it later in life. It scared him so bad, he had trouble sleeping, poor guy. Well, that's an awful thing for someone so young to have to go through. Yeah, it was. This went on for weeks. Then, all of a sudden, out of the blue, he was just suddenly over it. You mean, just like that, he was just over it? Yeah. Did he ever say why? Well, I asked him about it. He said he was afraid that he wouldn't be able to give US grand-kids. And, most importantly, one day, he wanted to be a daddy. Did you and Todd ever talk about starting a family? Oh, honey. Well, one day, he was just fine, he got over it. And I didn't understand why until yesterday. I was going through some of his legal papers and I came across this. That's it! What is this? It's an account, at a sperm depository. That's why he wasn't worried anymore, he knew that he'd be able to be a father. Okay, I don't understand why you are showing this to me. I'm not just showing it to you, I'm giving it to you. That way, if you ever decided that later in life you want to have Todd's baby, all you have to do is get a surrogate. This way, you've got an option. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything, you're family. If you want to have Todd's baby, this is a choice. You want to give me grand-kids? Thank you, ma. Thank you for coming into our lives and for making my son so happy. It's okay, Richie. Richie! Are you telling me what I think you're telling me? Yup, after that first day that I visited you here in hospice, I started screening potential surrogates. I settled on one last night. I've already purchased an egg from a bank and we're going to do the fertilization procedure next week. That's great, I can't believe it. That's fantastic. I'm going to be a dad and you're going to be a grandmother. Wow! Come here, give me a hug. I am so happy for you, this is gonna be fantastic. What's with all the affection? Did someone win the lottery or something? No, this is much better. Richie just told me he is going to be a daddy soon. That's exciting news, congratulations. What are you hopping for, a boy or a girl? At this point, I'm just hoping for healthy. That's a great outlook and you seem like you'd make a great dad. What's the mother like? Well, thank you! The mother is fantastic. She's got a wonderful personality. She's in great health and she came with multiple glowing references. References? You didn't buy a wife off the Internet or something, did you? No, no, Linda. He hired a surrogate. He's actually going to be a single parent. I see. Well, you're going to help me out once in a while when you're well enough, aren't you? Of course, you know I would do anything for you and your new baby. Okay, Mr. Paul. It's time for you to leave now. But I haven't even been here 30 minutes yet. I know that and I won't even dock you for your time when visiting hours start. But they haven't yet and Mrs. King needs her sponge bath. Unless you're willing to help with that. Oh, that is my cue to leave. That's what I thought. I'll see you later, ma. Okay, bye Richie. I'll see you later and congratulations! I'm a little confused. Clearly, Mr. Paul isn't your son, yet he calls you ma. And you're gonna help him raise a child by a surrogate. What's that all about? Well, it's a really long story, but I can give you the condensed readers digest version. See, Richie used to be my son Todd's partner. And we lost Todd few years ago to aids. Todd's dad had testicular cancer and Todd was really afraid he'd suffer the same fate. So he put his perm in a bank. Now Richie is going to be like the parent of my grandchild. Oh my god, Mrs. King. People say I have a complicated life. You are living a soap opera, girl. Sometimes it feels like it, Linda. Sometimes it feels like it. So I heard you had some breakfast, I'm pleased. And I know the doctor will be impressed when he makes his rounds later. I'm not surprised you heard. I was just telling Richie that you've got eyes and ears everywhere around here. You know, I wish they'd just let me take a shower. I feel like such an invalid somebody bathing me. Me too. I have real sick people to take care of. The sooner you get your strength back, the better for everybody. So, why did you come in late today anyway? Well, it's the third month anniversary of my brother's death. And every month on this day, I go and put fresh cut flowers on his grave. Well, I'm sure Terrence would appreciate that. Look, I need to ask you guys a question. We ask the questions here, Faye. Yeah, well, if you want any more cooperation from me, someone's going to give me a damn answer. Faye, until you Pierce the veil, we're not permitted to reveal what lies there. All will be revealed in time. Fine, then you're wasting your time and mine. Faye, that is not an option. Oh, now you're just acting like a child. We're not permitted to reveal your fate, but perhaps we can find some middle ground. Mr. Ash, you know our roles in this. And I know when to bend the rules, Mr. Church. Learn to play the game like a big boy for once. If I could interrupt your bickering for a second, I just wanted to know something about my nurse's brother. Terrence. That's a good start, tell me about Terrence. Mr. Ash, this will not be permitted! Come on, live a little. Well, now that the cry baby has gone off to tattle on me, let me see what I can recall about Terrence dermont. He really was quite the bad boy for a while there. Then he tried to walk the straight and narrow for a while and his past caught up with him almost immediately, however. Although he kinda made it in, just under the wire, if you know what I mean. So he made it into heaven? Let's just say he's having a much better eternity than the guy that shanked him in the showers. That's all I know. Was it right? Did it help? Yes, very much. Terrence called me from jail. He said that he had been framed. And that his life was in danger. But I didn't believe him. And he died. I was afraid that he was spending an eternity suffering, thinking that I didn't care about him. Now you know he's in heaven. You know what else this means, don't you? No, what? If this proves that they're real and they told me that I wasn't going to leave this bed alive, I won't be going home. You have to tell Mr. Paul. No, what good would it do? None. Besides, he'd just think I was crazy. Can we just keep this to ourselves? And Richard and I can have what time we have left together. You've got it, Mrs. King. Whatever you want. Thank you. First of all, start calling me Faye. You've got it, Faye. Second, I need to ask you a really huge favor. I certainly owe you one. Richie is a really good man. He lost his parents before he came into our lives, so he's got no one. Can you look in on him from time to time after the baby comes? I'd be glad to. With Terrence gone, it's just me and my mom now. I would be, it would be nice to have a man to call on every once in a while. And I'll be sure to let him know that he and your grandchild, can be as big as part of our family as he'd like. Thank you. You know, it's funny. Wouldn't it, it'd just be my rotten luck that when my life is over, I finally have a reason to live again. That's how you ended up here? Yeah, pretty much. Because you didn't have anything to live for? Yeah, I only left the house to go to the liquor store or take my neighbor lady Mrs. Hamill to the market. Some punks started hassling her, they know better than to mess with me. How is it that they hassled your neighbor, but they didn't bother you? See, they only made that mistake once. What do you mean by that? One of those little punks tried to mug me. So I took out my nine millimeter, aimed it at his jeans, and told him I was going to blow his balls out of his ass. Oh no, you didn't. I sure as heck did. What's so funny? You sound like some cliche '80s action movie star. I guess I kinda did. Well, he must have been a fan of that genre because no one ever bothered me after that. You know what, Faye? I think this is the first time I've ever heard you laugh. To be honest, I don't laugh very much anymore. I think Richard is the only one that's ever seen me laugh in the last few years, or crack a smile. I'm going to go grab some more towels, so we can get this bathing nonsense over. And Mr. Paul can come back in, okay? Sounds good to me. I thought you'd be gone a lot longer after the way you disappeared the last time. No, we are here for you, Faye. No matter what, we're going to keep coming back until our job is done. Oh, Christ. Not exactly. Ugh, what is it you two want from me? A decision has to be made, time is running out. "A decision has to be made, time is running out!" Like I've got some kind of choice, right? Well, what do you think? What do I think? I think I've been beaten. I think I've been beaten for a long time. I can't handle anymore heartache or anymore disappointment. This feels like the final kick in the guts, you know? To find out you're going to have a grandchild, and you can't watch it grow up, and you can't watch it be born. I just want this to be over. So tell me what you want me to say and I'll say it. So, does that mean that you believe you are beyond redemption? Does it matter what I believe? Is spending the second half of your life drinking yourself to death and keeping a cat with leukemia alive, worthy of the damnation of hell fire? Isn't it though? Who would you like to go with? Again, what does it matter what I want? If you had a choice, who would you choose to guide you to the afterlife? Shame on you, Mr. Ash, for deceiving her and making her think she had a choice. She was always intended to come with me. But you saw her! She wanted to come with me! She took my hand! You suffered greatly in life, but even when you could no longer care for yourself, you still looked out for others. Faye, you belong in heaven. You just couldn't see so for yourself. And as for you demon, you're done here! Now, let's go see your husband and your son. Oh. We have but to step into the light and then you'll be home, Faye. Do I still have a choice? I'm not sure what you mean. Can I choose to stay? Would you choose to stay, knowing John and Todd are waiting for you? I finally come to realize how precious life is. I have a lot more living to do and now I'm needed. I think I made it very clear on how I feel about bending the rules. I know you did, I'm sorry. I don't want to break the rules, I'm just asking if it's a possibility. But this is a one time thing and I cannot say how long you'll be able to remain. Life is precious and I know that now. And you'll take care of yourself? I swear. Then go. So, you gonna go dancing with me and the girls tonight? Oh, thanks, Linda, but I got toddie junior tonight. We've gotta give Richie a night off every once in a while. Yeah, what she really meant to say there was grandma's kidnapping his son and forcing Richie to go out and try and have a good time. So, where you going tonight? You know, honestly, I have no idea. I haven't been out in so long, but I'll figure something out someplace. If I don't, she's never going to give me my son back. Well, I know some good mixed clubs. Why don't you come out with me and the girls tonight? I guarantee you'll have a good time. And don't be giving me that I don't dance line neither. Because I've seen you dancing around here with this baby of yours. - Oh, I'm busted. - She's got your number. Oops. Oh, can you take toddie junior for a second? Absolutely, give me that handsome baby. I'll be right back. Be a good boy. Be a good boy. So, where's the, where's the demon hippie? Oh, he's only allowed around when, you know, a decision has to be made. It was your pain and regret that clouded your path to heaven. So why are you here? Are you ready to go? I don't think I'm ever going to be ready, but I'm prepared to do what I'm supposed to. Your time isn't up. I'm just checking to see if you're as good as your word. So what do you think? How does what I think even matter? Oh, so now you've developed sarcasm? I didn't think angels were allowed to behave that way. I don't just think you're alive, Faye, I think, I think you've finally come back to life as well. So, how long do I have? You have as long as you need and are needed. Do you say that to all the people you bring back to life? Oh, I didn't bring you back to life, Faye. That was all you. I just helped you see clearly. You had to figure out and understand if you had anything to live for. I think you're about to be paged. Oh, come here baby. Did you give me this baby because you knew he was about to mess his drawers? Oh no Linda, it must be something about you that brings it out of him. I change dirty diapers on adults all day long. I don't need new experience. And what were you looking at anyway? Oh, nothing. Just appreciating everything around me. Come on, stinky!
