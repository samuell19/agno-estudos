Dear brothers and sisters. My voters who can make a pauper a king and a king a pauper. Due to the untimely dismiss of our popular and admired leader.. ..my party has given this young lad.. ..the responsibility of serving you. All of you have to take the decision. Brothers, I don't say to give me your vote. And choose me as the MLA. But I do tell you to think who are you choosing.. ..by giving your valuable vote. Will he really be honest? Will he serve the public altruistically and selflessly? Most importantly, we should see whether he has the capability. The promises he is making, the promises he is making.. ..to the public, is he strong enough to fulfill those promises? Mothers, sisters, if you see honesty in me and my words.. ..then give me your valuable vote and make my youthful sentiments victorious. After winning the election, the first thing I want to do is ban liquor. It's the cause of our mothers and sisters' sorrow. A person becomes brutal after drinking. I will ban liquor from my locality.. ..the way we have vowed to eradicate poverty from our country. Glory to humanity. Glory to our country. Vote for.. - Suraj Prakash! Vote for.. - Suraj Prakash! Vote for.. - Suraj Prakash! Vote for.. - Suraj Prakash! This is Suraj Prakash. Yes. Yes. Everything is going smoothly. You see, I will need some workers. And along with it, cheap oil. I mean, kerosene. Yes. Thanks. Okay. Bye. Today, there is electricity in every household. So why kerosene? To set the party office ablaze. - What? We don't understand this ruse. We have fought many elections. But never done this. Isn't it, Ram Prasad? - Absolutely true, Shyam Prasad. Yes. - You guys fought elections. And I am standing in the election. The rumor will be that the opposition has set it ablaze. Fire will cause ashes. Showing the ashes we will gather votes. It means sympathy garners votes. We will win very easily. Wow! - Wow! Wow! Mr. Suraj Prakash from Lok Kalyan party, Amirpur.. ..has been elected as the winner. He has defeated his closest opponent Mr. Nirbal.. ..by a margin of more than 10000 votes. Congratulations. Congratulations. Mr. Trivedi, this by-election victory is not mine. In fact, it's your victory. It's your blessing. Suraj, I am as happy as you. It's our party's victory. You lived up to the trust shown on you. And Suraj, you consider me your guardian, you respect me.. ..you revere me, so I will tell you the secrets of success. Yes. Command me. Son, your sight should always be on the sky. And whenever you get the chance, climb the ladder of success. Don't even look back. Don't ever think about whom you had to use on your way up. It's a famous saying. You have to use the bait of small fishes to trap big fishes. If you bless me, someday I will trap all the big fishes. Sir, by winning late minister's seat, I have proved my worth. What do you think of my minister post? Yes. Actually, I want to talk to you about that. Sandhya. Why do you need flowers? You yourself are a flower. Hey! Aren't you happy that I have become the MLA? Yes. I am very happy. But I felt bad that I heard the news of your victory on the radio. Forgive me. Actually, the by-election was very prestigious for the party. It's a small victory for me. It's a beginning for me. Yes. I need your help to win the political tactics. How can I help you in politics? Sandhya, do you remember you used to say.. ..there is a woman behind every successful man? And I make fun of it. Can you imagine, Sandhya? High command's observer is going to recommend me.. ..for the post of a minister. Just imagine, Sandhya. After I become a minister, my prestige, fame, wealth.. ..everything will grow. And the future will bring only happiness for us. I am really happy that your dreams are coming true. But to make my dreams come true.. ..I will have to please him and flatter him. Our destiny lies in the hand of the observer. But he has a small condition. What? He has seen you with me. And he told sir that he wants to spend a night with you. A woman can't even dream that her lover.. ..her future husband will say such a thing. You shouldn't have said such a cheap thing to fulfill your ambitions. If you had been a true lover and a true man.. ..you would have strangulated that brute right then.. ..when he asked your lover from you. You are making a mountain out of a mole hill. Think about our future life, Sandhya. I won't enjoy the comforts and luxuries alone. Your glory will also elevate. And who will know about the night? You forget it in the morning. I will also forget it. Understand that observer's power, Sandhya. He is a very powerful man. Please. - Don't touch me. It feels repulsive. It's not easy for a girl to sell her body.. ..to lose her self-respect with another man. ..when people will ask you who is the father of your child. Don't threaten me. Instead of living with a cheap man like you.. ..it's better that I tell people that the father of my child is dead. Instead of marrying you, it's better.. ..to kill you and get hanged on the noose. So that I become his puppet. No, Mr. Suraj Prakash. It's been the tradition of Kanwar Enterprises. To help upcoming leaders. What's the difference between help...and bait? I very well know that. And I know Kanwarlal and his businesses too. He gives money to political leaders. So that his illegal activities remain hidden. But this time Kanwarlal made a mistake in recognizing me. I serve the public. And as a true worker I will ruin Kanwarlal and his business. Go and tell him. - Sure, sir. I will deliver your message to Mr. Kanwarlal. Goodbye, Mr. Suraj Prakash. - Now get out. Look at this. We were getting money and you rejected it. You returned such a huge sum of money. And on top of that you have invited trouble. Had you guys been so clever.. ..you wouldn't have been only fighting elections. With God's grace high command will let you fight a few elections. The money he had sent was paltry. I want something bigger. 'This is much more than what you had expected, Suraj Prakash.' 'The workers' death will tighten the noose..' '..around Kanwarlal's neck.' 'Now no one can stop me from becoming a minister.' Young MLA Suraj Prakash displayed bravery and handed over.. ..to the police the trucks of Kanwar Enterprises.. ..transporting illegal goods that mowed down.. ..four people on the way. Due to which today a formidable man.. ..like Kanwarlal has to come to the court. Mr. Kanwarlal, your bail amount has been fixed for 10 lakhs. Wealth can't buy me, Kanwarlal. - Oh really? But the greed of position can buy you. And you can do any cheap tactics for that. What's surprising is that a cheap man like you.. ..is talking about character. Salim. - Sir. Tell the MLA his history. His history is very interesting, sir. In 1978 he was rusticated from college for beating his professor. But he misguided a few students.. ..and held a rally outside the college. And became a student leader. In 1980 he was caught stealing during the riots. But he evaded punishment under the guise of leadership. And in 1984 he entrapped a decent girl in his love.. ..and also made her an unwed mother. He abandoned her as well. And in 1988 he is dreaming to be a minister. He wants to serve the public. You are a criminal of our nation. - You are talking nonsense. In that case every businessman is a criminal. Give me the name of one company that doesn't tamper with its accounts. Give me the name of one person who pays tax honestly. And doesn't fool the government knowingly. If he doesn't do this, how will he acquire skyscrapers.. ..and fast cars? But Kanwarlal has risked his life and earned wealth. He has the courage to face any obstacle. He is not ungrateful like you. To not even hesitate to sell his mother when the time comes. My wealth is the outcome of my courage and cleverness. Henceforth don't try to judge my business. Whether it's good or bad. Otherwise I will be compelled to take the decision of your life. Your party has bought it with the money.. ..that I have donated. The liquor that you drink, the food that you eat to survive.. ..the clothes that you wear in front of the people.. ..even the land on which you are standing.. ..all this has been bought with the money.. ..that I have donated to the party fund. You have no inkling of my power. To display your fake courage in front of innocent people.. ..don't ruffle a formidable man. First be Kanwarlal's equal and then talk. Suraj Prakash doesn't have the time to look at people like you. You are not capable of competing with me. Then let's see, Suraj Prakash, who wins. Your fake rights that have no value.. ..or my humanity that has no throng. Firefly like you that shimmers at night. Or Kanwarlal who is the rising sun. Challenge. Challenge. Chief Minister Mr. Singh has expanded his group of ministers.. ..by electing young MLA Mr. Suraj Prakash. People welcomed minister Mr. Suraj Prakash warmly. Ladies and gentlemen. I am indebted to all of you. - Amazing! My heart belongs to you, friends. Amazing! Wow! - No. No. This is not needed today. Have fun. All of you have done a lot for me. Cheers. Tell me, Mr. Ramnath. - Sir, I trouble you again and again. I feel ashamed. My elder daughter got married with your blessing. I have fixed the younger daughter's marriage too. But.. Salim. - Yes. Give Mr. Ramnath Rs.50000. - Yes, sir. Go, Mr. Ramnath. Conduct your daughter's marriage with great pomp. God bless you. Here. - Thanks. Hello. - Hello. All of you start working on the orphanage. I have made all the arrangements. Thanks. - Thanks. Sir, this is a cheque for leper hospital. How much amount should I write? 2 lakhs. - 2 lakhs. So much money, sir? I am sorry, sir. Salim, if money comes to the aid of a needy person.. ..then it's money. Otherwise it's a piece of paper. The wealth I have earned by going against law and society.. ..should come in the aid of someone. If even one person blesses me.. ..I will feel the wealth has been useful. Send the cheque today itself. - Yes, sir. Hello. Yes. Tell me, Jagan. Did you deliver the goods? The police have put up barricades. Jagan, the goods should reach there at any cost. But sir, it seems very difficult. Just do as I say. Rest I will take care. Okay, sir. Drive faster. Auto union! - Long live! Auto union! - Long live! "Kanwarlal." "You are Kanwarlal. You are Kanwarlal." "You are the king of the dark world. Your ploys are amazing." "You can do whatever you want. You have money." "You are Kanwarlal. You are Kanwarlal." "I am Kanwarlal. I am Kanwarlal." "Kanwarlal." "Kanwarlal." "Kanwarlal." "Kanwarlal." "Be it a doctor or a judge." "Kanwarlal. Kanwarlal." "I share such a bond with everyone." "Kanwarlal. Kanwarlal." "Be it a doctor or a judge." "I share such a bond with everyone." "Even danger is afraid to come near me." "You give gifts to everyone." "Everyone is wealthy." "You give gifts to everyone." "Everyone is wealthy." "You are Kanwarlal. You are Kanwarlal." "I am Kanwarlal. I am Kanwarlal." "I am the question with no answer." "I am the question with no answer." "I am Kanwarlal. I am Kanwarlal." Sir, his name is Nandram. He is PP's assistant cum secretary. He has years of experience. But he is dim-witted. PP only lets him handle the court dates. He is also useless. Who is this simple lady? Sandhya. She is PP's assistant, sir. Very intelligent lady. PP trusts her a lot. She has no family. Only a small son. Salim. - Yes. She is useful for us. I want all the information about her. Get it quick. - Right, sir. Sandhya. Is this Kanwarlal case's file? Yes. Why? I want to note some points. But I can't give you the file. It is an important file. And PP is a very strict man. Just now he only sent me to you. You are worrying needlessly. As it is, I will check the file while standing here. And don't worry. I am the inspector who arrested Kanwarlal. But.. - Don't you worry. Here. - Thank you. Careful. - Okay. Sir. Sir, that police officer has disappeared. Which police officer? - He.. Oh! Your brother. - Brother? Sir, I don't have any kin. You only sent him to note points from Kanwarlal's file, right? Me? I sent him? Yes, sir. You only gestured to me. What nonsense are you talking! Did you give him the file? - No, sir. He said he will check and return it. But he ran away suddenly. I searched the entire court. But he is nowhere. You irresponsible girl! - Sir, I.. Hello. SI Anil speaking. Is there any inspector called Arun Kumar? - No, sir. We don't have any inspector called Arun Kumar. If you narrate the incident yourself.. ..it will save the court's precious time.. ..and you won't have to stand in the witness stand for long. Sir, the truth is that I gave the file to the sub-inspector.. ..whom you had sent. Oh God! Again the same nonsense. Mr. Kanwarlal, if someone can benefit from the missing file.. ..it is you. Only you. So only you can hatch the conspiracy of stealing that file. Tell me. Where is the file? Mr. Public Prosecutor, can you tell me? Whether Hitler's right leg was shorter or his left leg was shorter? What nonsense are you talking? Then you talk sense, Mr. Public Prosecutor. You are asking me about the file which was in your possession. If I am talking foolishly, you are talking really absurdly. Talk respectfully, Mr. Kanwarlal. This is the High Court. When did I say this is a tennis court? Order! Order! By the way, Mr. Public Prosecutor.. ..on what basis can you say that this decent lady.. ..has committed the crime you are accusing her of? The criminal's guilt is evident on the face. Her anxiousness, her nervousness testify it. Tell me, Mr. Kanwarlal. How much money did you give to Sandhya? Seems like now I will have to tell you the truth. - Please. Please. 2 lakhs. - Very good. But I gave the money not to Sandhya, but to you. Me? - Yes. Now see the nervousness on your face. Your legs are shaking. It can be interpreted that you have committed this crime. I.. Your Honor, I don't understand what's going on. Which case are we arguing about? Mr. Kanwarlal, whose truck was allegedly nabbed.. ..while carrying smuggling goods. Or the missing file that junior public prosecutor misplaced. My distinguished lawyer, Mr. Public Prosecutor.. ..wants to waste the court's time by making the case complex. ..and they are trying to malign my client Mr. Kanwarlal. Sandhya, have you ever seen Mr. Kanwarlal before? No. Did someone bribe you and took the file from you? No. I don't know who took the file. All I know is that I have been cheated. Sir, you have to praise Uttamlal's mind, right? I shook the entire court. You didn't do anything great, Mr. Attorney. What's happening, sir? Amazing! Where were you? Didn't you see? I was roaring in the court like a lion. I silenced everyone with my questions. Suraj Prakash's ruses failed. Because we got hold of the file. Don't give yourself the credit, Mr. Attorney. You got lucky by fluke. And you are praising yourself so much. Don't laugh! Don't laugh! I saved you guys. Otherwise instead of Sandhya you would have got arrested. What? Sandhya has been arrested? Uncle, what's your relation with mother? I...I am her secretary. Jagan. - Sir. Sit in the car with uncle. I will just come. Come. Salim. - Sir. Tell the lawyer that Sandhya should get bail by tomorrow. No. I didn't give the file. I have been cheated. I have been made a scapegoat. Until now I endured every sorrow. I faced the difficulties of life bravely. But I can't endure humiliation. They are slandering me. They are blaming me for the crime which I didn't commit. I didn't commit any crime. I didn't. Your crocodile tears won't affect me. Sandhya, your tears can't prove your innocence. Yes. I know. I know, Minister. Tears affect humans. It won't affect brutes like you. It didn't affect you that day when you were sending your lover.. ..to spend a night with another man. Who can expect humanity from you? To hell with humanity. See my position. Today I am superior to Kanwar. Respected Minister, understand this.. ..and before I throw you out, go away with your wretched presence. Get out. "Life is a kind of intoxication." "Intoxication.

Hello. Have a seat. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Yes? - You didn't recognize me? I am John Jani Janardhan. I had called you. Oh yes! Tell me. What's your case? Surprising. Shocking. Amazing. I told you everything on the phone. On the telephone. Yes. But I couldn't hear everything on the phone. Will you please tell me again? Your phone is foolish, stupid, idiot. Still I will tell you everything. Actually, the biggest lawyers in town compete and vie.. ..to fight my case. But it's the matter of a woman, a lady. So I thought it's better if you handle it. Thanks. Will you tell me the details of the case? It's very simple and easy. You see my wife.. - Yes. Seema. Sunita. Sharifa. I want to divorce her. You have three wives? No. I have only one wife. She has different forms. And that is what I can't endure, bear and tol.. Tolerate. - Yes. Exactly. I can't. But why do you want a divorce? Now what to hide from you? You are my attorney, my lawyer. Actually, I sold my wife's ornaments, jewelry.. ..and invested it in business. I incurred a loss in business. We started having fights at home. There were beatings. In my anger, in my rage, I broke her legs. Now she wants to join hands with her brother.. ..and break my bones. Look, find a way so that I get divorce. Divorce. Once I get divorced, I won't have any bond or relation with her. There is another lady. She is going to bring 5 lakhs in dowry. Look, do my work quickly. Because it's urgent. Then I will give you the murder case too. I have found a very good solution for you. I knew you are very clever and intelligent. Tell me the solution quickly. Tell me the solution quickly. I will give you the solution. Come. Thank you, Sandhya. But.. - Come on. What did I do? I didn't break his leg. I never broke his leg. I.. Because you have tortured and abused a woman. No problem, Attorney. I have contacts in the centers. I will surely take revenge for this. Revenge. Got it? Understand? Come on. Yes. Coming. Won't I even say bye? Come on. Let's go. Got me trapped. Got me trapped. What did you do, dear? If you don't like the case, then refuse. Why are you making enemies needlessly? Mr. Shastri, we wear a black coat and stand in the court.. ..to protect truth and justice. Not to support lie and injustice. But dear, for our profession.. Profession should be not only for livelihood. There should be some limits too. How were those lawyers who defended the killers of our.. ..great leaders and tried to save them from the noose? No, Mr. Shastri. I won't do that. God bless you, dear. Your resolutions are strong. ..Sandhya and that innocent child are in trouble. You are right, sir. Their lives have really become miserable. We should help them. Salim, go and give them whatever they want. I don't care how much money is spent. They shouldn't face any problem. Pardon me, sir. You couldn't recognize Sandhya. She lives alone in the society with a child. No one knows who his father is. She has no one in the world, sir. Still if a person has prior knowledge of a calamity.. ..he can make arrangements to defend himself. You can say whatever you want. I am your culprit. To save myself I put you in trouble. But today, I have come to rectify my mistake. Here are 2 lakhs. It will compensate the loss that you suffered because of me. Can it restore the honor I have lost? Can it restore my dignity? Can it erase the stigma caused by you.. ..on my honesty and sincerity? Such money might be valuable for you.. ..who doesn't know the worth of pride and dignity. I think it's better to die than use this money. Look, Sandhya. Don't be emotional. If you ever need anything, know that.. ..Kanwarlal is indebted to you. Anytime. Here is my personal number. 571042. Stop! Teacher. Here are Raju's fees. Henceforth I will try to pay it on time. But Raju's fees were paid three days ago. Paid? Who paid it? I don't know that. Sandhya. - Yes. A man came in a car. He has left something for you. Who had come, aunt? - Dear, I have never seen him before. Okay. 'Sandhya, I used you for my selfish reasons.' 'I can't tolerate that.' 'I am sending your bangles and chain.' 'Don't get angry and send it back.' 'I will help you till my last breath.' 'Kanwarlal.' Sandhya...all my notions about you were proved wrong. You rejected the money I gave you. And now I am helping you without telling you. You don't like that too. It's very difficult to understand you. I don't know what you are made up of. I am like every other person. But you can only understand those women.. ..who sell their body for the greed of wealth. Or those who are your slaves. They can even kill someone for money. You can only understand those people.. ..because you have spent your life amid those brutes, Mr. Kanwarlal. In the letter you wrote that you will help me till your last breath. Who are you to help me? You must be God for goons and ruffians. Not for a woman like me who still has conscience. You are the enemy of a self-made woman like me. I don't care what you think about me. But it's my duty to help you. I will keep trying till you get tired of refusing me. And Kanwarlal does whatever he resolves. No one can change my resolution. I am not interested in your resolution. The loss I have suffered is enough. Now don't try to slander me by coming.. ..to my house again and again. Wait, Sandhya. If you don't like help, then work for me. Handle all my cases. In return I will give you ten times the salary of that public prosecutor.. ..who suspected your loyalty and insulted you in the court. This will solve your as well as my problem. Your obstinacy. And my wish. No. I don't want to be a partner in your crime. I don't fight false cases in the court. The day I am helpless, I will consume poison. Committing suicide is cowardice. And being obstinate against circumstances without thinking.. ..is foolishness. You are absolutely right. I am a coward because I am a woman. But I have become bitter because of you. Let it be. You did whatever you could do. The ornaments are here. I will repay the money you have spent on me.. ..as soon as I find work. It's not so easy to find work, Sandhya. I can at least wash vessels in 10 houses. I will starve my child. But I will repay your each penny, Mr. Kanwarlal. Goodbye. Mr. Kanwarlal, I have told you so many times.. - No. No. I am not Mr. Kanwarlal. I am your well-wisher John Jani Janardhan. You had sent me to prison. You made me incur a loss of 2 lakhs. 2 lakhs. You have to repay it. - Shall I call the police again? Surely. Surely call them. If you want to see your son's dead body, then do call them. What did you do to my son? Where is my son? Your son is here, with me, drinking milk. I brought him here straight from school. Bring 2 lakhs cash. And take your son. For God's sake don't say that. From where will I bring so much money? You don't have to worry. The bank comes to your house. Your friend Mr. Kanwarlal. I can't take money from him. Think about it. If I don't get the money, I will strangulate your son. No. Don't touch my Raju. Please. Please don't do anything to Raju. I am requesting you. Please. Fine. Arrange for the money by night. I will call up again at midnight. Midnight. Goodnight. Hello. He.. So the incident took place yesterday in the morning. I beg your pardon, sir. At 6 in the morning. Inspector! Inspector, some goon has kidnapped my son. For God's sake please hurry up. Hold on. If we don't find him, we will lose our job. Where can he go? As per the witnesses, he jumped from the wall. I beg your pardon, sir. I think he must have passed the electric pole. Because the pole was wet. He must have pissed on it. Officer, my son has been kidnapped. He is demanding 2 lakhs. If I don't give him the money within 24 hours he will kill my son. The person who gives the whereabouts.. ..of the man we are looking for will get a reward of 10 lakhs. Sir, on what basis can we say the electric pole was wet.. ..because he pissed? Any evidence? Any witness? Besides him who else has the habit of wetting the pole? My son has been kidnapped. And you are not listening to me. I beg your pardon, sir. She is the same girl who stood against the minister in the court. I see. Ma'am, here. And write your report. When, where and how your son disappeared? What's the color of his clothes? We will inquire and also show his photo on TV. You won't have to spend money. Inspector. - Hey, girl! Come on. Don't waste our time. I beg your pardon, ma'am. Go. Excuse me, sir. Dog. Idiot! Not dog. Puppy. No. Puppy. IG's dog, sir. Stop! Stop the car! Stop! Please stop! Please help me. Sandhya, you? Tell me. What brings you here? Someone has kidnapped our son, Suraj. I don't know where he has hidden him. Our son, Suraj. - Our son. What nonsense! Keep quiet. If you want, you can save him. Right now I don't have anyone besides you. Oh! - I beg of you. Tears don't look good in the eyes of a brave woman like you. You are not an ordinary woman, Sandhya. Today you want to fall at the feet of a cheap, dirty man? What about your pride? You lost your son? That's why you are crying so much? It doesn't look good for a woman like you.. ..to cry and run on the street. It will be a disgrace of womankind. For God's sake if not on your son.. ..at least have pity on an innocent child. He can't even eat on his own. My son must be wailing in hunger. If not as your wife, help me as a helpless woman. Please. Who is she? What happened? Tell us. Who is she? Who are you? What drama have you created? Poor woman is in trouble. Someone has kidnapped her son. Ma'am, why are you wasting the minister's time? Sir, it's our job. We will handle it. You sit in the car. - Go. No. - Bye. Suraj, listen to me. - Come on. Suraj, listen. - Come on. Suraj. 571042. Hello. Hello. Hello. Who is it? Hello. This is Sandhya. - Sandhya. What's the matter, Sandhya? You seem very worried. Tell me, Sandhya. Mr. Kanwarlal. - Answer me. John Jani Janardhan has kidnapped my Raju. He is demanding 2 lakhs. From where will I bring so much money? Please save Raju. I can't live without Raju. For God's sake save Raju. Calm down, Sandhya. Nothing will happen to your son as long as Kanwarlal is there. Now tell me. Where did that rogue said to bring the money? He didn't say anything. He said he will call at midnight. Seems like it's his call. Pick up the phone. Hello. Time is over. It's his call. Hello. John Jani Janardhan. Who is it? You interrupted in between. My name is Kanwarlal. Rogue, is your entire body shivering? Hold the phone properly, you coward. Come out of your hiding. If I drag you out, I'll make your plight really bad. Tell me...what's your demand? Only...200,000 rupees. Where do I get it? - I won't tell you. Otherwise you will kick me on the phone and make my plight bad. Fire brigade. Kanwarlal, why so quiet. So you think you can hide from me? You're right, correct. I am in a place where Kanwarlal can never come. Remember one thing, you dog. If anything happens to the child.. ..then I will eradicate your entire family. Hello. Fire-brigade. - Yes. Can you tell me in which part of the city has a fire broken out? Janakpuri. Janakpuri...thank you. What happened to my kid? Be patient, Sandhya. Tomorrow before sunrise, your child will be in your arms. Come on. So the fire's in Janakpuri. This means that coward's hiding someplace here. Now we need to find out.. ..that who has a phone in this area. This is a slum area, sir. It's difficult for anyone to have a phone. But, sir, there's a ill-reputed hotel Chandna out there. They must have a phone. Hotel Chandna. Where's the owner of the hotel? Yes, sir, what can I do for you? I've been trying to call this hotel for half an hour. But I can't get through. I guess your phone's really busy. - No, sir. A customer called half an hour ago. The phone's unused since then. Who was it? - He's upstairs with a dancer and a small kid. Which room? He left the kid, only the dancer's upstairs. Which room? - What do you want, sir? The same thing she's here for. Keep it. - No, sir. Keep it, buddy. Come on. Room no. 517, sir. Who is it? - John-Johnny-Janardhan. Open the door. I've received the money, Who are you? First tell me where's Johnny. - I don't know. You don't know? - I don't know. You really don't? No. I was wondering how sharp this knife is. And I am thinking that if I swing this knife.. ..then you will be beheaded. What are you thinking, madam? Do I tell them to swing their knife or are you telling me? I'll tell you. I'll tell you. You stay here, we'll go inside. - Wait. I will settle the score with that coward. You're crying again. First you were crying out of hunger, I gave you beer. After drinking beer you started crying for your mother. You're a small kid, but you've been troubling me so much. You.. - No. No, don't hit me. - Be quiet, or I'll slap you. Don't beat me. - Quiet. Welcome. I know when a coward's death is near, he runs towards his enemy. Boys...squeeze...the life out of him. Fatso, we'll see who squeezes the life out of whom. Uncle! Uncle! Kanwarlal! Raju. My son. Go, son. Go to your mother. Mummy. - Raju. Where were you, son? Kanwarlal. By saving my son's life I owe you. You've done a huge favor to me.. ..I'll never be able to repay you. If you ever need my help, then I'll consider myself fortunate. Sorry, Sandhya. Kanwarlal never depends on anyone. Bye. Uncle. Someday I will help you. Promise? - Promise. A party that can protect people's rights.. ..has no right to be in power. Incapability of the police and carelessness of the minister.. ..emergency meeting in the parliament. Opposition collectively opposes.. ..the strong behavior of Minister Suraj Prakash. This news are being printed as newspaper headlines. Announced on radio. Broadcasted on television. I thought that you're a capable candidate.. ..that's why I made you the minister. But you turned out to be unsuccessful. Due to your incapability.. ..the opposition is demanding our resignation. When a helpless woman was begging to you for help.. ..she was requesting you to save her son.. ..you tried to extract personal enmity. Did you have to show your pettiness? Those who doesn't care about the people's interest.. ..isn't capable to be the minister. The police that can't protect the rights of the people.. ..are not entitled to high ranks. Mr. Chief Minister. Being the party chief doesn't give you the right.. ..to blurt whatever you like to me. Maybe you forget, that.. ..50% of the MLAs are supporting me. One non-cooperation petition can ruin your health. Even I swore to my post.. ..in front of the same Parliament, where you did. Our post might be different, but not our power. You didn't make me the minister.. ..it was the grace of High Command. Possibly, but it's a dilemma. Today we sit on the same seats.. ..which were once occupied by the great leaders.. ..who served the people without any interest. Be ready to face the opposition tomorrow at the parliament. Otherwise...I will wait for your resignation. You've grown old. Such boys threaten me of the High Command. Minister sir, what was your reply to the allegations? The opposition has demanded your resignation. Will you resign? Can you tell us the name of the savior who saved that woman's kid? Look, I came here to know the chief minister's well-being. He was touring the drought infested areas yesterday. And he fell prey to food poisoning. Okay, goodbye. What do you want? If you think you can disgrace me with Kanwar's help.. ..then you are mistaken. I am Suraj (Sun). No one can stop me from shining. I will shine in this world. No matter how powerful you get. Your police, your government cannot shake Kanwarlal. He's like a mountain. You're very petite compared to him. I know, Sandhya. Since you couldn't have me.. ..you're resorting to such cheap tricks out of jealousy. The fish squirms in the net, not when it's out of it. And people like you play dirty games. Because you people are always scared. If two MLAs withdraw their support.. ..then you'll lose your government. Even a beggar can be a minister, if he gets votes. But if you lose your post.. ..then no one will even give you alms. Yes, who can evade destiny. So I've taken a decision. Why don't we come together? Live a respected life. I'll call the reporters tomorrow. You can tell them that the child's kidnapping.. ..you coming to me for help, and the child being found suddenly again.. ..was all Kanwarlal's idea. There was no reality in it. You really are the right person for politics. But I will never let you near my son or me. Suraj (Sun) and Sandhya (Evening) can never be together, Everything evening falls, the sun will have to set. Your onset here indicates towards a storm which has stopped. Don't ever come here again. Only words can't change fate, Sandhya. When one's destruction is close, he starts thinking negatively. Unfortunate. I can't even pray for you now. Mommy. Mommy, who's this uncle? He's the minister, son. You can go now. A man should always settle his scores. Yesterday you had brought 21 lakhs. - Sir, am I saying anything wrong? Hello, sir. - Hello. Welcome. - You be seated. Is the minister in? - Of course he is. And he's waiting for you too. Right, Shyamprasad? - Absolutely, Ramprasad? Look, he's here. - He's here. Hello, sir. Hello. Greetings. - Bless you. How's everything, son? - All is well. So why did you call me? I had my eye on you for a long time. I thought let's do something for you. Do you know what politics is.. ..and how powerful it can be? - Yes, sir. People say that if humans are born with 'chakras' on all 10 fingers.. ..or become a politician, both the ways, he'll always rule. That's exactly what I want to do for you. I was thinking of making you the President of my party's social-wing. But I don't know how popular you are. And what's your image amongst the people. Sir, I am very popular. My name is printed in the paper every day. Son...if you want a good position in politics.. ..then you'll have to do a few tricks to enthrall the public. Sir...I just want your blessings. And then see what I do. Last week there was a piece of news in the papers. Public prosecutor junior.. What's her name? Oh yes, Sandhya. Her child was abducted. And I was accused of not taking any action. In fact even the police didn't help her. And a unknown savior brought the kid back. Now the opposition is demanding my resignation.. ..saying that I was very rude. Did you read that? - I did, sir. You were humiliated. And that unknown savior is none other...than Kanwarlal. And he succeeded in his ruse. Anyway, now I want to teach him a lesson.. ..which he will never forget. And remembers that.. ..if he tries to touch Suraj Prakash, he'll be burnt to ashes. So now it's important to teach him a lesson in his language. What do I have to do, sir? Destroy all his hideouts, that's all. Sir, Kanwarlal is the king of the underworld. Interfering in his matters is digging a grave for yourself. Sir, he's got connections with the chief minister. That's called killing two birds with the same stone. Destroy Kanwarlal and I'll become the chief minister. Then...what are my orders. Gather the workers and start a strike. But, sir, how can we start a strike without a reason? Kanwarlal's liquor shop is two feet away from the church.. ..and a permit room close to the temple. You can create a chaos on this subject. And people from every religion will be uncomfortable. It hurts their religious emotions. The religions gurus will support you. And you can ruin Kanwar with their support. And I will restore peace amongst the people.. ..and create an image of being unbiased. Kanwarlal.. - Down! Down! Kanwarlal.. - Down! Down! Kanwarlal.. - Down! Down! Kanwarlal.. - Down! Down! Kanwarlal.. - Down! Down! Listen to me, brother. Why are you breaking things? Listen to me. Come. Come let's talk peacefully. Please. - Okay. Look, brother. Listen to me. Why are you breaking things? You want money, don't you? I'll give you money. You can keep all the money. But stop this chaos. Why are they creating a stir? I've seen all the destruction myself. When Emperor Ashok saw the bodies of his soldiers.. ..in the battlefield of Kalinda, his heart was filled with regret. But Kanwarlal's heart is filled with revenge. This attack was planned on someone's orders. It's time to behead that person. Jagan, the hands that tried to ruin me.. ..we'll have to sever them. Go ahead. Look, I still have the money that you gave me. You can keep them if you want. Yes, keep them. Go. Take advantage of his sacrifice, Lawyer. Don't lose this opportunity. Jagan should be punished. He will be punished, sir. But we need some witnesses.. ..who saw Jhanga getting murdered. And they can testify in the court. - We're there for that. Right, Shyamprasad? - Absolutely, Ramprasad. Have you forgotten? Many criminals were acquitted because of our testimony. And we saved many murderers and rapists with our testimony. The judge gives his verdict when he sees us. Considering that if we're testifying for him, he must be innocent. Right, Shyamprasad? - Absolutely, Ramprasad. Yes. But, PP sir's forgotten.. ..that we saved him from the rape case. And our testimony proved that.. ..PP sir was only fishing at the lake. Lawyer, Jagan should be acquitted from the case. It seems very difficult. That fool was caught red-handed, sir. Proving your client innocent proves a lawyer's capability. Yes, sir. But why don't you understand. The situation is against us. They've two witnesses who can talk for hours, sir. They are both politicians, sir. They lie so convincingly, that.. ..they can even prove a dead man guilty and get him hanged. Till today everyone they have testified against.. ..have landed up in jail. But, sir, we should pray that Jagan isn't sentenced to life. Nothing will happen to Jagan. He works for Kanwarlal. I'll spend all the wealth required. I'll move heaven and earth. Hello, Sandhya speaking. Sandhya, this is Kanwarlal speaking. - You. I need to discuss something important with you. - What's wrong? Rack through all the books of Law, Sandhya. But Jagan shouldn't be punished. Sir, you're wasting your time and money. When a experienced and senior advocate like me can't win this case. Then how can this poor novice lawyer win it, sir? Kanwarlal, I will definitely fight this case. Leave it to me. It's my responsibility to get Jagan acquitted. Thank you. We swear we'll speak only the truth. And nothing but the truth. Because we are not used to lying. Right, Shyamprasad? - Absolutely, Ramprasad. The events that occurred on 1st of April, 10:0 pm on Friday.. ..in Jhangya's house, will you please tell it to the court? Yes, we'll tell you. - One by one, please. I'll tell you. That night, at 10:30pm.. Your honor. At exactly 10:30 pm when we were sitting at Jhanga's home.. ..and discussing about the birth and care of donkeys.. ..at that time, Jagan entered with a razor in his hand. And then he opened the razor. He took a leather belt from his pocket.. ..and started sharpening the razor. Then he caught Jhanga's neck. We thought he's a barber, he must be giving him a shave. But suddenly he stabbed Jhanga in the stomach. There was blood everywhere, sir. We started shivering. We closed our eyes out of fear. And when we opened our eyes, Janga was already dead. Oh, God! - Your honor.. ..the testimony of these respected citizens.. ..is enough to prove that Jagan murdered late Jhanga. So your honor, I would like to request the court.. ..to severely punish criminal Jagan. That's all your honor. Any cross-examination. - Yes, honor. Hello. I've heard that you two are great speakers. Nobody can equal you in giving speeches. Good. We're great. If we aren't stopped, we can give speeches for 6 hours. Few days ago, I was returning with my friend.. ..after watching a dance program. Someone was giving a speech in Taimur Nagar. The man was speaking really well. My friend said "If I find out who that man is.." "..then I'll gift him a gold chain". And just now when I heard your voice.. ..I thought maybe it was you two. Shyamprasad, shall I tell her? - Yes, Ramprasad. We won't get another chance. Fame and fortune. Actually, madam, we were giving a speech that night. I see. So tell me how long did you give a speech? 3 hours. We spoke for 3 hours. Which means 6 hours together. That means until morning? - Yes, it was morning. The sun had risen. 1st April, Good Friday. You gave a speech at Taimur Nagar. - We did. So how is it possible that.. ..you were present at Jhanga's home at the same time? Yes, how can we be at.. - Two places in the same time? Then how did you see Jhanga getting murdered? Whereas you two were giving a speech. Right. Jhanga's home can't be seen from Company Baug. So how could we see it? So that means you two didn't see Jhanga's murder? No, we didn't. Your honor, it's been proven.. ..that these witnesses are fake. One thing's for sure, that.. ..someone's fueling this case for his own personal motives. I've already presented important documents.. ..and doctor's certificate in the court.. ..which is enough to prove my client innocent. So I would like to request the court.. ..to deem Mr. Jagan innocent, and acquit him. Sorry, Sandhya, I had a little too much today. But you're responsible for it. Because you turned my defeat into victory. Congratulations. - Thank you so much. No, don't drink anymore. Sandhya, this alcohol cannot harm me. It's got no effect. Because...the volcanoes that erupt in this heart.. ..never calms down. They are like the poison in Lord Shiva's throat. This alcohol can't harm me. Naughty girl. She's smiling slyly. She looks so innocent. But oh my.. She gave such a heated argument in the court.. ..that the poor public prosecutor was puzzled. You know...who's going to defend Kanwar Enterprises cases? Sandhya. Sir, what's happening? What about me? - You? You will take rest. I am glad that you've been defending our cases until now. After today...you'll work as Sandhya's junior. Junior? - And you won't give your advice.. ..until she doesn't ask for it. She doesn't. Salim. From today, Sandhya is our and my company's lawyer. Before dawn tomorrow, the pen she'll write.. ..the sandal that she'll wear, the clothes.. ..which would make her look beautiful.. ..and the house where she'll live in, should be given to her.. ..according to our company's stature. Your happiness isn't the result of winning the case. I'm observing a new inspiration in you, right? Correct. Absolutely correct. "Sweetheart." "The one I loved...for the first time." "That's you." "That's you." "The one I loved...for the first time." "That's you." "That's you." "The one who made my heart delicate." "That's you." "That's you, you, you, you." "That's you, you, you, you." "There's no beauty on this earth, who is like you." "You, you, you, you, you, only you." "There's no beauty on this earth, who is like you." "You can ever give life a lesson on living." "You, you, you, you, you, only you." "The one who inspired me to conquer the world." "That's you." "That's you, you, you, you." "That's you, you, you, you." "The one I loved...for the first time." "That's you." "That's you." "Sweetheart." "I can forsake the world." "If you be mine forever." "You, you, you, you, you, only you." "I can forsake the world." "If you be mine forever." "There's nothing else I want." "I'll have everything in the world." "That's you, you, you, you, you, only you." "The one who filled this heart with love." "That's you." "That's you, you, you, you." So they've forsaken all honor and respect. They're roaming around holding each other's hand. Yes, sir, they've forsaken the norms of the society. I said what's going on? You know I am a righteous man. I don't like such things at all, sir. I told them that you can make Sandhya your personal lawyer.. ..and allow me to go. Lawyer, quitting your job.. ..won't be enough to stop his ill deeds. For that.. ..you'll have to help me. You'll have to tell me about his actions. What are you saying, sir? If Kanwarlal finds out I came here.. ..then he will definitely kill me, sir. Mr. Lawyer, a Minister's home is the safest place for you. Your safety is the government's responsibility. If you help us turning Kanwarlal over to the law.. ..then the government will protect you. Sir, I am risking my life to tell you this. My safety is not your responsibility. Kanwarlal has hordes of black money. Just yesterday he loaded his warehouse.. ..with lots of stuff, and if you raid the place.. ..you can catch him red-handed. Are you listening? How the criminals are roaming free under your nose? Why are you staring at me? Go and raid his warehouses. And if you find any evidence.. ..then arrest him under section NSA. Where is Mr. Kanwarlal. Sir. Sir, the income tax has raided the place. Your warrants...raids to his warehouse...were useless. You couldn't lay a finger on him. He fled with his black money. Every time he strikes to kill me. He takes each step to humiliate me. What to do, sir? We tried our best. But he gave us the slip. But don't worry sir, we won't give him this chance again. We'll find a permanent solution for him in 24 hours. Listen. As long as Kanwarlal's meddling in my affairs.. ..I cannot progress ahead. I will have to get rid of him to move ahead. Suraj Prakash, you're trying to test my patience. You're inviting your death. I always had the strength to defeat my opponent. But I still don't have the patience.. ..traitors that I raised myself. When I found out that one of my men.. ..squealed all my secrets. I prayed that it's...not Salim and Jagan. I am happy that the traitor is not one of you. Tomorrow the situation can force you to bow. Yes, sir. But don't say such thing. We can't see you upset. That disloyal lawyer Uttamlal is responsible for it. He's leaving for Delhi by tomorrow morning's flight. But Uttamlal shouldn't live to see tomorrow. Uttamlal, I am grateful to you. - Thank you, sir. You'll lead a luxurious life for 15 days. And when you come back.. ..the chief minister of this country would've changed. I mean I would be the chief minister.. ..and Kanwarlal would be rotting behind bars. Don't you worry. You're an invaluable part of us now. Minister sir, I will definitely go to Delhi in the morning. But only if he lets me live until morning. Look after his requirements. - Sure, sir, Goodbye. What's happening? - Don't worry at all. Take a seat. - Sit. Sit down comfortably.. - Comfortably? Okay. Enough, enough. Go quickly, inform the minister. - Come on. Call the police. Call the government. I am not a novice lawyer. I am Uttamlal. The best. What's going on? Sir. Sir. Sir, listen up. A terrible thing has happened. Listen, sir. Kanwar's men have reached the room. Dear, now it's difficult to run this orphanage. ..I feel like I am helping my old parents. Take it. Dear, parents feel proud.. ..when the child works hard and makes and honest living. Money earned through wrong means.. ..is like a curse for human beings. But if your conscience says that this is your hard earned money.. I wish you had seen my hunger-stricken father death. And my sick mother's pain and restless. The way I pleaded to this society.. ..for wood to burn my dead mother. If 10 year old innocent Kanwarlal.. ..hadn't dragged his mother's body to the crematorium.. ..then eagles and crows would've feasted on her. I've endured all this. I know what life is. You can forget your bitter past and change yourself. And if you don't change.. ..the society will always call people like you, a devil. "Who's God here?" "Every human is the confluence of God and Devil." "Every human is the God and the Devil." "Every human is." "The sun will always rise from the east." "Human nature is unwavering." "No one can change it." "No matter which direction you live in." "The sun will always rise from the east." "Human nature is unwavering." "No one can change it." "Who will you call good or bad?" "Every person is good and bad." "Who's God here?" "Who's the devil?" "Every human is the confluence of God and Devil." "Every human is the God and the Devil." "Everyone has equal goodness and badness in him." "God made this world by making sins and merits." "Everyone has equal goodness and badness in him." "God made this world by making sins and merits." Even after minister Suraj Prakash's security.. ..lawyer Uttamlal was murdered. But even after realizing his incapability.. ..minister Suraj Prakash didn't give his resignation. The minister's been proven incapable on many other occasions. Gradually people from every class are losing faith in him. Written by Brij Sharma? Who is Brij Sharma? Who is Brij Sharma? His pen is mightier than the sword, sir. Right, Shyamprasad? - Absolutely, Ramprasad. A man can survive the blow of a sword.. ..but not the blow of his pen. Kill that dog. Even his body shouldn't be recognizable. But I couldn't buy a single heart.. ..who actually sympathizes with me. But I can get it from a sympathizer as a gift. Sandhya...I want to be a nice man. I want to live in a ambiance surrounded by love. Turn my dreams into reality, Sandhya. Please. Sandhya, if you support me then I'll forsake everything. I will never look back at the life I am living now. I never asked you about your past. Neither do I want to know. All I want is a few moments of refuge. That's all. Only someone unfortunate can turn down your gift. And I am one of those unfortunate people. I am a mother. Being someone's wife is not my right. I only want a right to your heart, Sandhya. Not your body. Forgive me, Kanwarlal. Even a animal with a broken limb isn't accepted for sacrifice. The Minister might be powerful.. ..he might have millions of fan following.. ..he might be wealth, but he has no right to torture anyone. This cannot be tolerated. If such torturers are not punished.. ..the people will lose faith in the law. I request the court that once the crime's proven.. ..the accused should be given severe punishment. In that private bungalow, Sandhya.. ..gets Kanwarlal's job done using her beauty. When I found out the truth.. ..Kanwarlal tried to shut me up. And he bribed me to write against this Minister. And when I refused he threatened to kill me. They forced me to file this fake case. Fearing my life I was forced to do as he said. But...I told the truth to the court.. ..because...I am safe here. This Sandhya, who sells her body for money.. ..that Kanwarlal, who uses her body to get his job done. Sir, these two...made me play this charade.. ..only to trap the minister, your honor. I've told the truth, your honor. But these people won't spare me. Sir, I plead for my safety. Protect me and my family, your honor. Kanwarlal, here. So, Kanwarlal, how was my quagmire. Now you know how cunning and powerful I am. Even the court was deceived. You and your good friend Sandhya.. ..was humiliated in front of the society. Take all the MLAs to the Ramdeep bungalow. And get their signatures on the non-cooperation proposal. Those who want money, and those who want a post.. ..promise them the same thing. - Come. Let's go, Ramprasad. Look...someone's shooting.. Help. Help. Help. Throw away your revolver. Stop. Okay. Goodbye, Minister. Sir! Sir! Sir! Forgive us, sir. - No, Jagan. Jagan.. - Forgive us, sir. Jagan. Jagan. No, Jagan. No, Jagan. No, Jagan. No, Jagan. Jagan. Jagan. What are you doing? - No, Sandhya. That rascal can't live now. No, I won't let you become a murderer. I want to see his body filled with bullet holes.. ..so that all his blood drips out before he dies. You're being emotional and taking the wrong step. If you kill him now, he'll be deemed as a martyr. He'll be remembered in history. Suraj Prakash.. - Glory to him! Suraj Prakash.. - Glory to him! Suraj Prakash.. - Glory to him! Suraj Prakash.. - Glory to him! Suraj Prakash.. - Glory to him! Suraj Prakash.. - Glory to him! - Congratulations. Suraj Prakash.. - Glory to him! - Congratulations. Suraj Prakash.. - Glory to him! Suraj Prakash.. - Glory to him! Suraj Prakash.. - Glory to him! I want to help you. Make arrangements for a better life for you. Don't worry. None of your men will face any inconvenience. I am your student. I'll follow your ethics. We'll have act as one.. ..to run and make our government strong. If we keep fighting amongst ourselves.. ..then soon we'll be out begging on the streets. The law will forgive all your crimes on my orders, First hear the verdict of my court, Suraj Prakash. Stop. Please, stop. Sandhya. You? Here? No, Sandhya. When you needed me, I was of no use. And today when my death is near.. ..then you're trying to save my life. No, don't embarrass me when I am dying, Sandhya. No... No! No! Let me go. No, let me go. See, Kanwar, such a terrible end. It's time for you to die, son. You will breathe your last at my feet. Do you know what will be Sandhya's future after you die? The government will put her behind bars.. ..for supporting criminals. And her kid... will beg on the streets. Like you were in your childhood. Before you go to hell.. ..I want you to think about their end and squirm. Now I will rule. Now this problem's out of my way too, It's a happy day for me today, Kanwar's lying at my feet. When one's destruction is close, he starts thinking negatively. He was trying to kill Suraj. Amazing.
