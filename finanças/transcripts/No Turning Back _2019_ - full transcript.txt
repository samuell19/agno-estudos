Keep the nose coming around. And watch the horizon. That's it. Rachel. Hello? Haven't you have some news for your Dad? I got into Little Shop of Horrors at school. Well done Pumpkin. Not the part I was going for, but it's still good to be in it. What part did you go for? Audrey of course. She's the lead. Makayla and Ashleigh said I did the best audition and they reckon I should've got the role. Well, you've never had a lead role before! I can hope. What does it say on Mom's fridge magnet? "Believe in yourself, follow your dreams." So what part did you get? Crystal. And are you happy to be in the show? Yeah, yeah, I'm stoked to be in it. That's good. It's a fun musical and I can't wait for rehearsals to start. Well, you can tell your drama teacher if she needs any help with the costumes with the costumes I can be there. Okay thanks Mom. Rachel's parent teacher interviews are Thursday at 6:30. Are you coming? Of course. Have I ever missed one of Rachel's parent teacher interviews? Her teachers all love her to bits just like her Daddy does. Oh, I forgot to tell you. I got offered a promotion on Friday. Hm, I like the sound of that. Bill. You wanted to see me? Just a second Nick. I'm very pleased to tell you that we have scored that Wentworth contract. The partners are pretty chuffed. We want you to stop working on the Northland Aerospace job and take over as project manager for Wentworth as Technical Support Chief Engineer. You'll have a team of four including Bill Yates, Eric Shephard, Peter Wong, and Dave Callan who will all report to you. This is a promotion Nick. Sorry, it's just, I'm about three months away from finishing the Northland job. We'll get Sanderson to finish off for you. Salary reviews are coming up in April and you are guaranteed an increase. I'm guessing it will be a decent one too. How long do you reckon it will take to see this one through? Now, it's a big job so three years if all goes to plan. But it could be as long as five. Are you in? Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay? Y'know Nick, I thought you you would be as keen as mustard. I mean I fought hard to get you to head this team. You have always wanted to lead a team and now I offer you this and all I get is a cool "okay." Let's have a chat in my office And what did you say? I said I'll let him know. Nick, it's a promotion for gods sake! I just need to think about it for a few days. Well, why don't you see if you can get a few weeks holiday in before the job starts because, look what I got from the travel agent today? There's a great 14 day cruise leaving from Sydney the day after our anniversary. So I thought we could spend our anniversary in Sydney and then start off the next day. Well, don't you even want to know where it goes? I'm not sure that I can get away in June. You do realize its our 20th anniversary? I know and I'll find something special, maybe a weekend away. How many years have you been promising me a cruise? You always find a reason why we can't go. She's right Dad. You've always have an excuse! Well it's not as easy as that. I have I have some work commitments during that period. Rachel, why don't you tell Mom and Dad what happened to Emma today? Why don't you? Well she's not my greenie friend Emma got arrested today. What? Emma? Mm-hm, she was at the Greenpeace march and something happened and then she ended up in jail for over an hour. Now you see why I didn't want you to go? Mom, there were thousands of people there and only two people got in trouble. Anyway, she's home now. Today's flight was a lot of fun. I really really want to study aviation What you really mean is you'd like to do a pilots training course. Well that would be super cool! Max, your Dad and I think it's important to follow your dreams, but we'd like you to do a bachelors degree first. Dad, you did Avionics, so why can't I? No, the engineering degree came first, then the avionics. I'd like you to get your bachelors first then the whole world's your oyster. I nearly forgot. You've got some very interesting mail today. How was your test today Rachel? It sucked. I hate science, I just hope I pass. You are so full of crap, you always say that. Ah, hello! I passed my last science exam with "Achieved". Hardly a scholarship you brainiac. Aren't you gonna open the letter? I already know what's inside.. And? I received an email a few weeks ago, I was just waiting for the right time to tell you. Tell me what? It's from MarsX. Are you serious? I have applied for one of the 24 slots to go to mars and I've been shortlisted as one of 100 applicants. No you have not. There were over 200,000 applicants, so I didn't think I had a chance. C'mon, you are so full of bullshit. Mom, who's swearing now? I filled out the application in June last year and forgot all about it. MarsX contacted me in January to set set up an online interview for their chief medical officer, which I did the following week and I probably should've told you then, but I still didn't think I had a chance in hell. Show me the letter. Are you frigging kidding me? You've applied to go to Mars? Tell me you are not serious! Its only an application, that's all. An application? It's more than a bloody application! You have been shortlisted! Wait a minute. I'm not gonna fall for that one. You're so pulling my leg. Is this for real? It's for real. If this it's a joke, I don't think it's funny. Mom, I think Dad's being serious. That letter is for real. You're considering going to Mars and you never even discussed this with me? Dad! So how long does that mean you have to be away? It's a one-way trip. One way? It is currently the only way that they can get people on Mars within the next 20 years. But with technology advancing the way that it is, there's a real chance of a return flight at some point in the future. So when is this happening then? 2031, so it's a long way off, but I would have to travel to the States for training sometime soon. Forgive me but I'm having real difficulty understanding this. Are you telling me you're prepared to leave this family, leave me, leave your kids, your mother and all of your friends and just go off to Mars for the rest of your life with people you've never even met? Was Neil Armstrong wrong because he wanted to be the first man on the moon? Christopher Columbus, Francis Drake, Yuri Gagarin! I mean, where would we be if brave people didn't step out and take a risk? You're missing the point. No, none of the great explorers had their return guaranteed! You are leaving your family. This wasn't the right time to bring this up. And when was the right time Nick? Were you going to wait until I read about it in the newspaper? Same one? Why won't you tell me? This has been going on for months. I'm sorry. Just go back to sleep. If it happens again, I will go into the spare room. I haven't been to sleep. I can't sleep. Are you asleep? No. Do you remember all those years ago when we first went out you asked me what my dreams were, and I told you that I'd always wanted to learn to fly, but there was always something stopping me. Do you remember what you said? You said, "living is dreaming" Do you remember that? Yeah, well, I wasn't talking about dumping your family and going to Mars, was I? You said that from early childhood we're told to stop dreaming and start living, and you said that was a mistake. You said "Living is dreaming." Yeah, I remember that. I don't want to think about it right now. I just wish I could go to sleep and wake up and find that this was all a bad dream. I know Mom and Rachel are pretty stink about the whole MarsX thing but, I talked to Kevin today and he thinks its really really cool. I reckon I'd do it if I was old enough and they chose me. You know, I've never told you this, but I had a dream when I was about your age, that I went to the moon. Wow! Are you scared about going to Mars? I'm only shortlisted. I know Kevin's a bit of a geek, but he's knows a lot about this stuff and he told me if you are one of the first people people to go to Mars, you'll be a hero. Bigger than any pop star in the world. We're about 28 minutes already into today's spacewalk. We just got another question from XFoot4000 who wanted to know why PMA3 is gonna get moved in it's setup... Rachel has taken this news pretty badly. She's extremely upset. The kids are in bed, I think we need to talk. Maybe I'll pour myself a drink first. No, I don't want a drink. I want to know what is happening to this family. Nothing is happening to this family. I saw a once in a lifetime opportunity and I... Don't tell me nothing is happening to this family! You're prepared to walk away from us, your children and our marriage, and you tell me nothing is happening! I saw one of the biggest opportunities that a man could be part of... Stop the bullshit please! I want to know what is going to happen to us. Are you seriously going to walk away from everyone? I know that sounds dreadful and it hurts me to know that I've hurt you by doing this, but I've thought about this over and over, and yes, I am being a bit selfish. Selfish? That's a bloody understatement! You know, if every pioneer that led a major expedition wasn't brave enough... I don't give a stuff about pioneers or expeditions, especially ones to Mars. Even if it turns out to be humankind's - greatest exploration to date? - No, I don't care. I'm scared. And I can't believe you would do this without discussing it with me first! I'm sorry. I should have talked it over with you. This affects the whole family. It wasn't your decision to make on your own. And what about Rachel? What am I supposed to say? Dad's in a new reality TV series and he wont be home for a while. Actually ever. You know, I honestly never expected to get this far. And you say all this as if I've been chosen. I'm only shortlisted. Nick! Will you please eat your eggs while they're hot? Dad. You're on page three of the Tribune. Have you seen this? "A 45 year old Auckland Avionics engineer Nick Wilkinson "has been selected to travel to Mars in 2031. "He is one of 100 would be astronauts "chosen for the special training, "which is scheduled to commence in two months time." Well that's wrong for a start. - Give it here. - What the hell! You said shortlisted, and the paper is saying selected. Whats going on? No, it's just semantics that's all. I don't care about semantics. Which one is it? Okay. I am one of 100 candidates who will take part in the many challenges that they will throw our way. 40 of us will be selected to the next round. Then there's an isolation challenge. 30 people will make it, and then finally they will choose six groups of four that will become full-time employees. So I'm selected for the program yes, but, I'm only shortlisted for the actual mission. Well, thanks for telling me, and you didn't mention the interview either. It happened yesterday. The journalist came to the office and after the interview she asked for a photo. And it wasn't important enough to mention? I'm sorry. I completely forgot. There's just a lot going on at the moment. Kelsey and Mrs. Drake are here, grab your bag quickly. - Bye Mom. - Bye. Hey, what about me? Great article Dad. Dad. I was thinking about what you said last night and, you didn't get to be one of the 100 chosen just by filling out an application did you? No I had to provide a medical statement from our doctor. And? And, well, I had a call from the MarsX Chief Medical Officer asking all sorts of questions. Why did you change course after just one year at Auckland University? It would seem a huge waste of a year. I couldn't settle in Med school. It was what my parents wanted. They weren't very happy when I changed to do engineering. Yeah, but what about you? Were you happy with your decision? Yes. I don't think I would have gone into Avionics without that background. Mars looks a lot like our home, however it has an ever present red tint. Do you know anything about that? Iron oxide. It's very common on the planets surface. Both planets, Mars and Earth have many similarities. What similarities are you aware of? A Mars day is 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds, so the night day rhythm is very similar to ours here on Earth. Mars and Earth are a similar distances from the sun so that a Martian year, if I can I call it that, is 687 days. I think you can call that similar. Mars has water, mostly frozen water. Even if it is trapped under the North and South Poles polar ice caps. What are your motivations for wanting to join MarsX? Well, there's one question that I was expecting. I believe that it is the firsts in our history that are remembered. I can be one of the first people to set foot on Mars. I find that prospect exhilarating. I don't believe that we can continue on earth as we're going now. I think we are progressively destroying this planet. It will be the pioneers that go to Mars, that make the sacrifice that will ensure the human race survives. I think that step is the next great leap in our evolution and I want to be part of that. Mr. Wilkinson, I note you are married with two children. You have a son of 16 years and a daughter of 14. Have you told your family you've applied to MarsX? Yes. If you were running low on food would you consider eating one of your fellow Marstronauts? Quick, you're late! What did you say? No, go go go, you'll miss your bus! Mom, can you stop and join us for a bit? I've got something to tell you and it's quite important. Did you see the paper today? No, we don't get it in the middle of the week anymore. Well I'm on page three. Well, that's wonderful dear. Another award for your gliding? You know, we still have some of your cups here you know? No, its not about gliding. Have either of you heard of MarsX? Mars? As in the Planet? Yes. MarsX are planning to build a permanent human settlement on Mars. Mars. We were just reminiscing the other day, weren't we? About how obsessed you were with going to the moon when you grew up. Not the Moon Mom. I have been shortlisted to be one of the first humans to set foot on Mars! Mars is, a bloody long way away. I thought you might not believe me so, I brought the letter. So how many days does it take to get there? The actual trip takes about seven months. About a bit longer than astronauts currently stay on the International Space Station. But that's only one way. I don't think your Mother could cope with you being away for that long. Mom, many years ago there was an ordinary guy from a laboring family who had a dream. His name was Captain James Cook, and he became one of the greatest sea explorers of his age. Every New Zealander knows who he was. What's that got to do with you wanting to be an astronaut? Well, there were risks for James Cook. But he traveled farther than anyone ever had. And Sir Edmund Hillary, he's one of your idols. How many times have you spoken his name? Yet he took huge risks. No one had managed to climb Everest before him. But he did it and he became a national treasure. A hero. Yes, but you would be away for more than a year? No. This expedition is to colonize Mars. Oh, so you're going to build some sort of settlement up there? No. There will be four people in the first intake who will go to Mars permanently. Now, I've only been shortlisted. Well, why would they want to do that? Not they Mom. It could be me. How long would you be away? Its a one way trip. I'm not coming back. But you're my only son. Mom. The first crew, they won't leave until 2027. It's a long way away. Why cant somebody else go? Mom its a huge honor. But, you are my only son! MarsX will launch a series of six rockets called DDV's. Deep Space Delivery Vehicles over four years to deliver the infrastructure our team will need when they arrive. The first rocket will be launched in late 2019. - That's an old video. - Shh. What makes our mission different from the others is that our colonizers will live on Mars and spend the rest of their lives there. On arrival on the red planet, the astronauts will initially live in an inflatable Life Support Unit. They will assemble their permanent living quarters then construct the greenhouse, the laboratory, and then their office and workspace. And this will only be the start. With over 150,000 applicants, MarsX has has now narrowed the list to 200. From these 200 qualified and enthusiastic candidates two men and two women will be chosen to lead, in what will become the greatest scientific achievement in human history. Don't! You're so annoying! Any mail today? Nothing for you. But, there's a letter confirming Rachel's CT scan for 15th of April. The digital imaging they use in the CT scan was developed by NASA for the Apollo Lunar landings to computer analyze and enhance photos of the Moon. How do you like that slice of wisdom Nan? You can thank my friend Kevin for that. He also said that the earth is dying and that there's no way it can support any life if we keep polluting it the way we do. This whole going to mars thing isn't going to help those wallowing in poverty. Over a billion people suffer from extreme poverty on this planet. How many millions of children died just last year from poverty? So, doesn't it seem wrong to you to spend billions of dollars on funding a trip to Mars when people are dying from lack of food? Wow, so very erudite from my baby sister. Shut up Max! Over 250 million years ago there was an event which most people don't even know about, called the Great Dying. It was the greatest mass extinction in Earth's history. 96% of marine life was obliterated, and over 70% of all animals were wiped out. It was called The Permian Extinction. At some point in our evolution. we need to find somewhere else to live or the human race will be be wiped out altogether. That's exactly what Kevin said to me today. Ultimately 100s of thousands of people, maybe millions, will offer to live on a new world, but someone needs to be first. Someone needs to make that sacrifice and it would be so much easier for me if I could go knowing that I have your support. You have mine Dad. 110%. And what about support for me? And your responsibilities for your children? You will be well looked after financially. If I am chosen and if I get on the first flight. Rachel will be 27 and Max 30. All grown up and hardly likely to be living here. When Dad came out from England when he was 23, what did he have? 11 pounds and five shillings. And no return ticket. And my mother bawled her eyes out at the dock. And he wasn't married, you are. It's not as if I'm going to be out of your life. I'll have unlimited access to email and other communications. And as I said earlier, I reckon there's a reasonably good chance that we'll get back. NASA'll send a team a few years after ours and they're bringing their team back. Well, why don't you go with NASA dear? NASA haven't offered me a trip, but I reckon we could hitch a ride back with them. Hang on. Are MarsX saying that or you? Me. But it doesn't sound too impossible? If the human race is going to survive for another 5000 years we will need to colonize other planets. It's that simple! And if I get the chance to be one of the first settlers on Mars, I'd like to take it. And where do I fit into this? You will be part of it as my wife here on earth. And what does that mean? Every move made by the team on Mars will be televised live and relayed on earth via a 20 minute delay here on earth. They reckon it will be the biggest TV audience ever. You will be part of that. As will all the family members of the astronauts. Really? And who asked me if I wanted that? When we first met you would have given anything for a piece of fame. I wanted to be an actress, not a Mars widow. If I'm chosen and get to be on one of the first flights, you will have more exposure than Jenifer Aniston ever had. And if I say I don't want that exposure? They can't make you. Isn't this thought provoking? I mean, we all know its unlikely that I'll be selected but, the fact we're talking about this, I mean, this, this is fun. Nick, can you get that? Hi. Hi. Are you Nicholas Wilkinson? I am, but I'm not buying anything thank you. I'm Amanda Williams. What do you want? Do you know that woman? What do you want? She's my mother, and I believe the person she is with is you. Can we go somewhere else to talk? Laura, I'm going for a run. I'll be back soon. How did you find me? I paid a private investigator. Ah. Where are we going? Anywhere. I just don't think we should be at my home. Why didn't you answer my emails, or my phone calls for that matter? My life is rather complicated. You know what, lets go for a walk. C'mon, it's a bit more private. When I was going through her papers, I came across that photo. I asked my Dad who it was and that's when he told me he wasn't my real father. Imagine believing a lie for 25 years. Did you have a relationship with an Evelyn Davis 25 years ago? That photo was taken before her grad school ball. We were utterly inseparable. We met at an astronomical society Christmas party just a few months before. Her brother brought her along and we hit it off straight away. Problem for us was she was only 17 and we were spending a great deal of time together. Her parents thought that we were getting too serious and I was too old for her, so they split us up. Sent her off to live with an aunt in Hawkes Bay, and I never heard from her again. Did you sleep with my mother? I tried to track her down. I even went to Hawkes Bay but I couldn't find her. I was shattered. I was born in September 1993. I'm 25-years-old. Are you prepared to get a DNA test? I don't think I need to. Let's go back. Mom. I've got to go sorry, Tamara's here. Love you. - Hey! - Hi. Sharna can't make it, so you've got me on my own today. That's okay. Hey, how're you going with all the publicity Nick's been getting? Ugh. Are you all ready to order now? Can I get a cappuccino please. And a flat white. Anything to eat? No thanks. Not for me. Hey, Jim asked me what I wanted for my 40th and I said a trip to Thailand. So then he wanted to know what he'd be up for for my 50th and my 60th. And I said "I didn't know about my 50th, "but for my 60th he could come and pick me up." Nice one. You know, you are really the talk of the town. Everyone is on about you, Nick and the Mars thing. What are they saying? Don't worry about what people are saying. I think you are amazing for letting Nick do this. I mean, I could never let Jim do that. How many wives would let their husbands go on a one way trip to Mars? I didn't. He didn't even tell me he was applying. Oh my gosh! What? Sorry to interrupt, but are you the wife of Nick Wilkinson? Yes. Can I say, you are remarkable to allow your husband to desert you and your family. Shame I can't say the same about your selfish cad of a husband. Okay, well lets go. Perhaps we can sit over here. Apologies for my wife. I think your husband's got real guts. Thank you. Are you okay? I'm fine. I've got a bad vibe that this is a sign of things to come. I already had two people stop me today at the supermarket on my way here, at least they were supportive. Well you still haven't told me what the others were saying? Sharna doesn't say much. You know what she's like. And Kate reckons she can't get her head around why anyone would even want to go. And Jemma thinks Nick's a bastard for leaving you and the kids, but she never says anything nice about anyone anyway. Max can you give me a hand please? Max, get here now! Shit! Shit shit, shit! For Christ's sake why don't you come when I call you? If you came the first time we wouldn't have this stuff all over the damn floor! Oh shit! These bloody bags! Bloody supermarket! Stupid everything! With Robert and Jeanette. I feel like we're about to have a really awkward conversation. No, it's doesn't need to be awkward. 'Cause you see, if something doesn't sit right with her, you won't reject me. You haven't don't anything wrong. Strangely though, it's not you this time. So we've had this crunchy salted caramel biscuits in the studio for the last couple of days, and the reason I am bringing this up now, I am a fake, I am a fraud. What happened? They were out of a packet! - I - wanted to come clean. You could've just gone - I'll take it. - Yes I know, I know. But it wasn't sitting right. Hey Zeke, what's up? Okay, yeah yeah. I'll ask, gimme a sec. Hey Dad, Zeke wants me to go around to his place after school today, is that okay? That's fine as long as you're home for dinner and make time for your homework. Thanks Dad. Hey Zeke, all good here so I'll meet you at the gate after school, yeah? Okay yeah. Zeke, see you then. Zeke didn't want anything to do with me before, but now he wants to be my friend. Oh, Mom you don't need to do the dishes. But you're sick. I'm not sick really. I just couldn't face work with everything that's going on. It's driving me crazy. How are the kids taking it? Max seems okay. Rachel is not taking it well at all. She's bottling it up and not saying much. I can tell shes not got a good head space. I'm scared. Really scared about what's happening to this family. Are you going to accept Nick going off like that without a fight? What would you have done if Dad told you he was going off to the Moon and never coming back. I would have said "No you're not!" I just had to get those emails off. It's the second one today from MarsX. This is crap about you catching a ride back with NASA. "Scientists from the US space agency say "say that if you've been on Mars for 10 years "then you wont be able to come back "because your bones will be too brittle." Yes and they are currently working on solutions that will solve that very problem. It also says on the same site, "Why do people want to go to Mars? "For many enthusiasts it is an escape, "a chance for a new start and the challenge of a lifetime." Is that what this is about? You want a new start? Have I not been a good wife? Of course you have, and I love you heaps, it's just... Is it for the glory of it? No, this is not about me. This is about a mission that the people of this world need if it's going to survive. Well, if it's the mission that's important, then why can't you let some unattached person take your place? Darling, do you realize that the first four people to set foot on Mars will be immortalized in history? I mean, this is bigger than big! This is absolutely history in the making! History. Well, I will make history. I'm giving you an ultimatum! Either you withdraw from the selection process or you can find a new place to live! You're not serious. I'm deadly serious. You have got 48 hours to send that email. And in the meantime you can sleep in the spare room. Why? Because I want to make a difference? Y'know we cannot keep over populating... Do you know what? I don't want to talk about this right now! In fact I don't want to talk about it ever again! You've got 48 hours! Mr. Wilkinson. Paul Chamberlain. Hi. Nice to meet you Please, sit down. Forgive me if I'm a bit disheveled, it's been a hell of a week. Before we start, I need to know that nothing I say here will go beyond these four walls. What I have to say is very confidential. Mr. Wilkinson your medical records and information are protected by doctor-patient confidentiality. I know, but I want your assurance that my records are not available to staff or anyone else for that matter. In the medical profession we are all subject to a duty of confidentiality. Rest assured confidential is just that. Thank you. How may I help you Mr. Wilkinson? Ah, call me Nick. Well, I've been having some nightmares to put it mildly. I'm going through a very awkward situation with my family. Did you see the Herald on Monday? No, I don't think I did. About nine months a go I applied for a position as an astronaut to go on the first trip to Mars. It's really important that this meeting be confidential. Because if word got out that I was here, well my chances as one of the first to fly to Mars would be gone in a flash. Well, I didn't hear anything for months and to cut a long story short. Just last week I received an official letter telling me that I've been shortlisted as one of 100 candidates chosen to train for the positions available. The problem is that my family, well I hadn't told them. And to say they're very upset would be an understatement. So let me get this right. You saw an advertisement for a trip to Mars online you applied, you were accepted. Your family is upset so why didn't you offer to take them too? You know what, I think I am wasting my time here. Please sit down Mr. Wilkinson. Why would I sit down? You obviously don't believe a word that I've said. You must admit it... Why don't you tell me a little more of whats happening in your life? Please, sit down. Here is my letter from MarsX telling me I've been short listed. I am terribly sorry. I wondered if you were delusional. And just in case we're still not on the same page this is not a trip to Mars as in a holiday. This is four people in the first instance going to colonize Mars. And you were chosen out of how many people? 200,000 from all over the world. That is amazing! A huge honor for you. A huge honor for our country. Thank you. The problem is that none of the early colonists will be coming back. Now you're kidding me, right? No. And my family are taking it badly. Well do you blame them? Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. When you say that you're not coming back, do you mean not ever? Not ever. Your 48 hours is up! It's one o'clock for God sake. Well I cant sleep. And you obviously don't love me or you wouldn't be leaving me and our family. And I've thought about this and I don't want to live with somebody who doesn't love me. Can we talk about this in the morning? In the morning, you'll be packing your bags! Good night! Laura! When's your school play? I pulled out. When did you do that? A couple of days ago. Why? You told me you were loving being... Don't ask me why, I just don't want to do it anymore, okay. I hope you've packed your bag. Mom! Oh come on! Laura, the door is locked! Let me in please! Laura! Will you let me in please? Rachel, Max! Can you open the door please? Hi ya. Pete's sister is coming over at the weekend and she's supposed to be staying in here, so I hope you've got your shit sorted out with Laura by then. God, so do I. And in case you are wondering, I don't blame her. So you can sleep on that! Mike? Can you come across to the greenhouse? I've had an accident. Nick? Nick. - Can you hear me? - Nick, communications Breaking down. Can you hear us? Philippe are you there? Can you hear us? Akiko? Hey guys. I need some help. Nick are you there? Can you hear us? I cant breathe. Can you pull back on the vault? Philippe! Nick, you're breaking up. We can't hear you. Somebody help me! Nick? It's 1:30 in the morning. Rachel is missing, I can't find her anywhere. She's not in her room. What do you mean she's not in her room? I got up to go to the bathroom and something made me check on Rachel. She's not in her room. Dad, I've checked the bathroom and every room in the house. Shes not here, you need to come home. Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! We can't wake up the whole neighborhood. One, one, one, Emergency. Fire, Ambulance, or Police? Police. This is the police. Where is the location of the emergency? 440 Pearson Drive, Glenwood. What is the nature of your emergency? My daughter is missing. The route slider her room is open and she's missing. Okay, tell me what you know. She went to bed around 9:30. Said she was tired and that's the last we saw of her. My wife has a habit of checking on the kids if she wakes in the middle of the night. Did you or your wife have an argument with her tonight? No, we did not. She said that we have to lodge a missing person at the police station. We need to provide a photograph, you need to make a list of all her friends and associates. They want to know her bank account number, phone number, emails, social network sites, and she recommends that we don't even start until the morning. Apparently they get lots of teenage girls go missing overnight. Hello. Hi my name's Megan. I'm so sorry to ring you in the middle of the night like this, but I have your daughter Rachel with me and I think you need to come and get her. I think your daughter has drunk too much. Thank you for calling us. It's alright She didn't want me to call you! But the Manager had asked her to leave and she was asking around where she could stay for the night. Are you two friends? No, we met on the dance floor tonight. She was really crunked up. And about an hour ago started acting really crazy. I guess the bourbon eventually got to her. Thank you again for ringing us. They are usually really strict about 18 plus beautiful lady. Her mother and I were worried sick. Can we give you a lift somewhere? No, thanks. Bye. Bye! Bye! You can't call anyone, it's four a.m. What's happening Rachel, you have never done anything like this before? You had your Mom absolutely petrified. What about you, did you even care? Rachel, you know I care. Why would you say that? Why would you care, you're leaving remember, and I'll never see you again. I haven't even got the selection, I'm only shortlisted. Yeah well you might get selected and you don't care if you break this family up. I feel sick. That's not true! No I mean I feel sick. Can you stop the car? I mean it's not true that I don't care about breaking up this family. You're all the most important people in the world to me. So why are you leaving the people you say you love? I know it's hard to understand, but this is a chance for me to do something that can improve the lives of everyone on this planet. It's not hard to understand! You are leaving us, your family, to live on another planet and never see me or Mom or Max again. That's not true, I'll have access to the internet. We can catch up on what you're doing every day if we both have time. You can't even Skype! There's a 20 minute delay. I looked it up on the MarsX website. You gave us quite a scare. How long are you gonna make Dad stay away for? Until he comes to his senses. Dad's not a 17-year-old, he needs to grow up. C'mon. You'll miss your bus, you better get going. I'm gonna miss our chats in the morning in the car. Well, you better get used to it. Well, well well, you haven't returned any of my calls in three days. Rachel's results have come through and the news isn't good. The tests came back from radiology yesterday and it's Hodgkin lymphoma. What's Hodgkin lymphoma? Its a type of blood cancer. Nick? Yeah. The test came through last night and the doctor called after dinner and asked us to go in today. This is terrible. They want her to start chemo within the fortnight. Oh my God, Rachel. She's only 14 why... She seemed fine the other day apart from complaining about that lump under her arm. Well she's not fine and this treatment is going to hit her like a ton of bricks. Why didn't you tell me? I would have taken time off and gone with you. We didn't know. I should have guessed when the Doctor rang last night but my mind was somewhere else. Chemo? She's terrified! Emails. There are no new emails. Yesterday. There were no emails from Laura yesterday. Two days ago. There were no emails from Laura two days ago. Three days ago. There were no emails from Laura three days ago. Sent emails. Sent to Laura. I'm doing this for Rachel, but you are sleeping in the spare room. I thought I could come with you to the chemo today. You can forget it. We need to learn to deal with these things without you. Mr. Wilkinson thanks for taking my call. I'm glad I got you at home. No problem, it's Saturday here. Firstly I would like to apologize that it took so long for your formal contract to arrive. Unfortunately we have a problem and I'm sorry it's only come to light right now. The medical lab in New Zealand has received some inconclusive results about one of your blood tests. They assumed it was a false positive and that's what they reported to us. So we requested the full lab report to be sent to us. Perhaps our test are more thorough, I don't know. What did it show? We have asked Dr. Parata to do the tests again and to include a biopsy this time. I'm sorry to tell you this at the 11th hour, really, but astronauts health and safety is paramount. Can you tell me if it's serious? You will have to discuss that with your physician. We've sent our whole report to Dr. Parata. Have you noticed any swelling in your neck? No. What about in your arm pits? No. Anything in your groin? No. What about fatigue? Have you experienced any fatigue? I reckon we all get a bit more fatigued as we get older, but nothing more than that. What about night sweats? I've been waking up sweating, but I put that down to the nightmares. The doctor over at MarsX believes you have Nodular Sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma. It's a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the lymph system. It's hereditary right? No, no, not really. My daughter's got it. I don't see your family Mr. Wilkinson, your work... No, I know that, I know that, but she was just diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma just a week ago. That's very, very disappointing, but it's not hereditary. So what's this all about? Do you want the good news first or the bad news? The good news. Good news. No, the bad news first, then the good news. It's two against one. The good news first. The good news is that I am no longer on the team going to Mars. Woo! In fact, I'm off the program altogether. So you're all gonna have to put up with me for a bit longer. I thought it was great that you got into the program, but, I would have really missed you. Y'know, I'm actually quite relieved I'm not going. I was gonna miss you all too much. Let's have a toast. To keeping this family together. To keeping this family together. So, whats the bad news? The reason I'm not going to Mars is that I have the same health problem as Rachel. I have Hodgkin's lymphoma. I haven't seen you working on this for weeks. I've been a bit tied up. Has Mom said anything about the Hodgkin's thing? No. I'm a bit apprehensive about the Chemo but Rachel seems to have come through it without any side effects at all. Dad. You're gonna hate me, but, Mom said I wasn't allowed to tell you. Rachel hasn't had any chemo. She doesn't have Hodgkin lymphoma. Mom made it all up in the hopes that it would make you stay. What did you just say to me? Mom made it up. I'm sorry Dad. I thought she would've told you by now or something. I guess she's just scared about how you're gonna react. So, you're saying that the whole story about Rachel being sick is bullshit? Jesus, fucking Christ! Who would do that? She's desperate Dad. None of us wanted to lose you and that's what was gonna happen. So she told me that Rachel had cancer? That my only daughter had cancer to keep me from going away? I mean that's, that's appalling! It's completely unforgivable that anyone would do that! She gave me the biggest scare of my life! She knew it was wrong, she didn't know what to do. Well it worked! I wrote a letter of resignation to MarsX. I was just about to send it when I got the Skype call from the US! Max. I'm sorry. I don't blame you for any of this. I've a confession to make. But will you promise not to yell at me? I believe that Max has already told me. Has he? I can't believe that you would do such a deceitful thing. I was wrong. Wrong? You're fucking right it was wrong. I was bloody tormented by that news! And now I find out that it was some sort of sick lie? I know you'll hate me for what I did and it was underhand, but I did it because I love you. And it was selfish. But I didn't want to lose you. You used our daughter for a pawn. Who does that? We were scared Nick! We were hurting. You have no idea how scared I was. Please don't be angry with me. I did it because I love you and I don't want to lose you. And I feel so bad, because I feel like I'm responsible for you getting this awful disease because I made up that story. You're not. But it's like I gave you a curse when I made it up. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Oh Nick, sorry to call you so late. It's okay. I thought you would rather me to call now rather than wait. Is this about my test results? Yes. It appears I owe you an apology. Dr. Parata has done further tests as we requested and he also sent us the results of the biopsy. It all confirmed his original diagnosis. That I don't have Hodgkin lymphoma? Correct. It was a false positive. It's extremely rare to get a false positive for Hodgkin's lymphoma. My stuff up and I take complete responsibility for it. So I definitely don't have it? No, you have a clean bill of health. Please apologize to your family from me, this must have given them such a scare. So, what happens now? You are being immediately reinstated on the team. You will re-join the team of course? I'm sorry, I just can't, I can't do it. It's my fault. I apologize again. I should have never told you you were off the program before re-doing those tests. I let you down. It's not about that. Do you remember during our initial interview when you asked if my family knew that I'd applied. Yes, you said they did and they were okay with it. I lied. So, they were not okay with it? They didn't know anything about it at all. And they have taken it badly. I'm sorry I just can't do this to them. I have hurt my wife, and I don't know that I will ever be able to repair that hurt. But I'm going to try. I'm sorry, but you'll need to find a replacement. Max, This is the second time I've called you. Coming now! Mom says you have some news for me. Oh, I'm back in the musical. So what changed your mind? Miss Thompson said she really needed me, so... And! And, she offered me the role of Audrey. That's the lead part! How come? Oh, Haley's been off school for almost three weeks and she's not back yet so, yeah. Well congratulations Pumpkin, that's really good news! Thank you. Yeah, I'm pretty excited. Well, don't forget my offer to help with the costumes. I reminded her today actually. Audrey gets some cool costumes, so, I can't wait. Do you remember me telling you about Zeke from my class? Yeah, your new friend. Actually my old friend. He's been ignoring me at school lately. But I don't care, he's a weirdo anyway. Any mail today? Nope. Well, I have something that might interest you. Could you please pass that to your mother. What's this? I guess you just have to open it to see. Come on Mom, the suspense is killing me! I have already spoken to Janice. She's fine with you having three weeks off next month. Three weeks off for what? Your wonderful Dad has just booked us a 14 day cruise in the Med. Thank you. Did I get the right one? It's amazing. Better than the one I'd chosen All clear above and behind! Take up slack, take up slack. All out, all out. Charlie Echo Bravo, Alpha Kilo, thanks for the tow.
