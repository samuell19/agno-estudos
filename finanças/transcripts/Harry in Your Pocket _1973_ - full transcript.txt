Good to see you. How was the trip? All right.Good. Everything okay with you? Quiet. Awfully quiet. I hate vacations, Harry. Did you ever notice how many people die on vacation? You read about it in the papers all the time. They lie out in the sun and kill themselves from boredom. Well, let's go back to work. Ah! [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA] Why, just those two? Yep. Oh, here, Casey. For me? Present? MAN: I know what he's saying.Oh, I'm damned. MAN: What he's trying to tell you is he's lost his wallet. Well, we'll find somebody who knows sign language. MAN ON PA: South bound from Los Angeles. First class tourists... As a reminder there will be no smoking... Also, we'd like your cooperation... MAN ON PA: Now boarding on track number five, southbound train number 207 for Tacoma, East Olympia, Centralia, Elko, Portsmouth, Salem, Eugene, Klamath Falls, Dunsmuir, Redding, Namath, Oakland, and San Francisco. Connecting with eastbound trains in San Francisco. Excuse me. How much is that?Five dollars. MAN ON PA: Now boarding on track number five southbound train number 207 for Tacoma, East Olympia, Centralia, Elko, Portsmouth, Salem, Eugene, Klamath Falls, Dunsmuir, Redding, Namath, Oakland and San Francisco. Connecting with eastbound trains in San Francisco. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me, I'm sorry. Okay. Give it back. What? Come on, just give me the watch, Charlie. Okay. Just keep your voice down. You don't wanna get me in trouble. I'll get you in trouble. I'll scream my head off if you don't give it back. Well, that's not it. No, that's not it. Here, is this it? Thank you. Oh, it looks like I broke the clasp. You, damn near broke my wrist. You know, I was watching you the whole time. You're terrible. I mean, you really stink. Yeah, well, watches are hard. Oh. I'm sorry about the clasp. Why don't you have one of the others? You can have your choice. Look. Huh? Oh, my God. Gone. Purse, bag, everything. Well, it's a hell of a lot easier than the way I've been doing it. It's your fault. My fault? How is it my fault? I didn't tell you to leave them there. Why don't you take care of your own things? Take care of my own things? You stole my watch, you big idiot! Will you keep it down. Keep it down. You'll get us busted. Us busted? I haven't done anything, except have everything stolen from me. Will you keep it down? My watch stolen, my bag stolen, my purse stolen! Whatever gave you the idea you could be a pickpocket? Some old guy I met up in the workhouse in Omaha. I was in on a vag, but he was a real pro. I can tell. Some pro. Well... Well, I just started. It takes a lot of practice. You know, if I were you, I'd consider taking one of those aptitude tests. What are you gonna do when you get to Chicago? I'm not. How can I? My ticket, my money, everything was in that bag. I'll tell you what. I've got $200. You can have it. All of it. Are you serious? You are serious. You just stole my watch and now you're gonna give me $200. Yeah. What do you want for it? Nothing. Nothing? No strings? Nothing? Nothing. No strings. Cross my heart. Boy Scout's honor. Okay. You're a little weird. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hi, Casey. Harry. This is Francine. Hello, Francine.Hello. Come on in. Harry, I knew you had a long trip, and I thought perhaps, you know, well... Yeah. A very pretty girl, Casey. Delicious. Thank you. Say, Casey, we'll play a little cards later. Hang around. Right. I'll be damned. CASEY: Harry, you bought it? You know, you really are a nice guy. Thanks, babes. You're something else yourself. [CHUCKLES] Jesus. I mean, when you don't say dumb things like that. I just wanted you to know that I slept with you because I like you, not because of the money. What money? You son of a bitch. You said you had $200. I meant I could get it. Look at that. There's at least two bills there. Oh, boy. Sure there is. Hey, I'm not trying to con you. I said I liked you, didn't I? I'm not interested in the money anyway. You could drive a guy nuts. Yes, no. Yes, no. Well, I'll tell you one thing for sure. I'm putting you on that goddamn train for Chicago with 200 bucks just like I said. The hell you are.The hell I'm not. Look, you don't have to take care of me. You're not responsible for me. I'm responsible for you until I get you on that train to Chicago. After that you're on your own. Just because you stole my watch, doesn't give you the right to tell me what to do. Yeah. I knew I shouldn't have got near you in that train station. Huh, you're damned right you shouldn't. And don't bring up that business about your suitcase andthe purse. It's not my fault. I didn't tell you to leave them there. Well, if it's not your fault, I'd like to know whose fault it is. Yours! The hell it is.The hell it isn't. RAY: Well, if we don't get 200, I know he'll give us at least 100 and a half. So where is he? He's around. You married or anything? Not anymore. I was when I was 16. To a lineman. I can still see his big feet in front of the television. [WHISTLES] [TIRES SCREECHING] [HORN HONKING] Okay, okay. Just a minute, okay? Come on, get in. Say, I think we can do without that whistle, stretch. Okay, okay. I got some great stuff for ya. God, it's hot. Okay, what you got? Cheese. What does that mean? Cheese, the stuff that he brings me. It means your boyfriend's a stiff, lady. Knock that off, man. Hey, look at this. Two dollars. Two dollars for my watch? The clasp is broken. I know. Miss, now here are the goods. Bring me stuff like this, man. Cheese. $30. $100. $40. Hey, man, we gotta live. I'll give you $45 and a good line on something. What kind of a line? I'll connect you up so you don't have to peddle crap. $45. Come on. It's hot. Okay. You know a place called The Brasserie Pittsbourg in Pioneer Square? No. Well, you find it. There's a guy there named Casey. Now he is recruiting a class A wire mob. What's that? Pickpockets. Come on, get out of here, will ya? I got no time for this charity work. Give me a break. Hey, now, hold it. Watch it. Broken clasp. Two bucks, you said. Wholesale! Not retail! Brassiere Pittsbourg. 602, First Avenue. That's not far from here, I think. Man, if I could get in, get connected. Me, a cannon! What are you so hyped up about? Huh? A wire mob works together. A real team. Not like that crapping around back at the train station. You got people that stall for you. The cannon goes in, makes the hit, hands off. It's fantastic bread. Well, why don't you keep the money you got, and here, that'll get you to Chicago, at least. Okay? Take care of yourself. Oh. You're weird and you'd starve to death. That's it. One thing, let me do the talking, okay? Oh, absolutely. Hi. I'm Ray Houlihan. This is Sandy Coletto. I understand you're looking for, uh... Sit down, please. Tell me, who do you know around here? Better still, who knows you? Nobody, I guess. I've been working the Omaha area, and through there. You have a police record, no doubt. No. No? Yes. What for? [CHUCKLES] It was nothing. I stole a car. Years ago in Ohio. Nobody's looking for him. I mean, nobody cares if he's alive or dead. He's not here because he's so smart, or cool, or experienced. He's here because we're flat on our ass. Well, you got to move around a lot. You'll work with a first class cannon, but you've got to do as you're told. Are you still interested? Sure. Excuse me, I've got to make a call. Do you still think I'm weird? No. I think I'm weird. Harry, this is Ray, and this is Sandy. Come in. I guess I kind of blew it in the elevator there, but I'm not used to work... HARRY: He's too big. He's clumsy. They're both green, Harry. I thought, maybe the girl. Yeah, the girl maybe. Maybe? What maybe? The stall. You got the gift, and with a little work you might be an adequate stall. Stalls? You mean, all you're looking for is stalls? What'd you make me go for his poke for? I wanted to see if you had any guts. Yeah, man, but I've had experience. I don't need experience. All I want is stalls. What about you? You a thief? Yeah, sure, she's been with me for... No. No. I'm not a thief, and I haven't had any experience. I don't even know what the hell you're talking about. What's a stall? You learn to bump into people gracefully, setting them up for the cannon. That's Harry. I bump into people? For a living? You want it? Ray and I are in it together. Why? Beats the hell out of me. I don't allow drugs. No pot, pills, nothing. You can drink. A little bit. No whoring, no strong arm, no gambling, except where I know the game or where it's legal. You want us to join a church. I have rules. Lots of rules. We travel first class. Best rooms, best clothes, best food. Everything strictly the best. Casey handles the take. Turn everything over to him. No exceptions. Money, ID, credit cards, paper, all of it. He'll fence the whole package off. You can buy a whole lot in just one day with one credit card, you know. Yes. With a credit card they have your face and your handwriting. Right. Your share is 20% of the take. Each? Together. I pay all the expenses. Including fall money. Lawyers, bail, all the fees. But if you fall, that's it. Understood? Stand up, please. That's pretty good. If you know how to use it. I know it's pretty good. So what? You better realize what business you're in, my dear. What business does he think I'm in? Oh, what's that for? Buy yourself a dress. Something short. High heels. You get yourself a coat and tie. Cut some of that hair off. Why? It's not really that long. It is for a thief. Okay? I'd rather see you tomorrow at noon. What the bloody hell. Come on. [LAUGHING] Don't do it, Harry. I'll get someone else. [SIGHS] No, no, they might work out. I don't like it. I have a feeling that one's trouble. Nah, I'll kick him in shape. Oh, I meant her. Okay, go. HARRY: This is a prat poke. Cordeen poke. Insider. Prat kicks. Right, left. Patch kicks. Left, right. Bridge kicks. The pit. This is where most of our takes will be made. It's where all the big money is. I don't care how good you are. Any fool might feel his poke go. Just the law of gravity. Unless his attention is someplace else. If he's feeling something else, looking someplace else, thinking about something else. That's your job. Amateurs like you are taking the same risk for a two-dollar poke as they are for 200. So, we cut down on those percentages. That's my job. I steer. I locate Mr. Bates. Make sure that he's got something worth taking. I know where he puts it. You know, Harry knows. The rest is easy. I'm not breaking into a safe. I'm tapping a warm, breathing human being who can stick his finger in my eye if he tumbles. Okay? Okay, now we've got the law of gravity to worry about. And then there's Mr. Law. You know who he is. And now we come to Harry's Law. That's the most important. And Harry's Law is that Harry doesn't hold. Harry never holds. He doesn't keep the poke. Not for more time than it takes to pass it off. Not for more than 10 seconds. Understand? That's why I've never taken a fall. And that's the way I'm gonna keep it. So remember, the first law is that Harry does not hold. Okay? Fine. Well, let's go to work. Stand up, Ray. I'm gonna round the mark, the cannon. CASEY: A pappy. Forget him. Just an egg. Another egg. Never mind. How do you know? My boy, it's what I do. That's nice, but it's not worth breaking your neck over. Yeah. Who's that? Cannon squad. Now there is Mr. Bates. Okay, that's the mark. You frame him. How? Throw the hump. Okay. Let's go, Ray. Oh! Excuse me. I'm sorry. Are you sure you're okay? Oh, I'm fine. I told you, it isn't going to work. HARRY: They still think it's a god dammed game, don't they? Let's fix that, shall we? Right prat. What happened? I don't know. He missed it. [DOOR CLOSING] What's that? What the hell do you think it is? You're standing a mile away, sound asleep on his feet. You mean you hit that mark today? Are you retarded or something? I told you the law, right? Harry never holds. Not for a minute. Not for 30 seconds. Now you started out breaking one rule that does not bend. Harry, he didn't know you'd gotten it. He just didn't know. What do you think I was doing out there, selling pencils? Harry, you hardly touched the guy. It was too fast. He had no idea. There must be a thousand bucks in there. Yeah, that's right. And I carried it home, all the way, in my pocket. Harry, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were that good. Your share. Harry never holds. School's out. [DOOR OPENING] We could still cancel our reservation on the Titanic. I knew he'd screw up, but I had no idea he'd leave me holding. Harry, why not pay him off? She'd go with him. Maybe at my age, I've forgotten, but is it worth it? Yes. This would get you to Chicago. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Harry wants me to take care of you two. So that's it, huh? Yeah. That's it. He wants you both to get some better clothes. So, I'll take you shopping, and Harry will go with you. [DOOR CLOSING] It's okay. [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHING] He looks good, though. The glass of fashion. What about her? Doesn't she look terrific? I thank you kindly. Did you tell him what happened today? No. No. No. Oh, come on, what happened? [LAUGHING] No. Well, you two had an adventure yourselves today. What happened, Ray? Well, all I can tell you is that I'm not going shopping with Casey again. [LAUGHS] It's a good thing Casey was there. The salesman was all eyes for him. Waiter. You want another round, or should we... Sure. Another round. Whatever you say. You're the boss. Not after hours, I'm not. Oh. And you never told me that he could smile. And the truth is, he can't. Really, he's just a very large monkey, and it just looks like he's smiling. Actually, when they do that, they're terrified. Well, I think in that case, we'd best feed him. Well, I think that's a good idea. Better get Casey something pretty soon here, or he's gonna fall off the chair. You know, you can't drink too much after a certain age. Ray, I want to tell you something. The best friend I ever had. I mean the best friend. And that's important in this racket. CASEY: Well, I'm gonna tell you, we're gonna be together a lot, you know, and that's not easy. And you know, that traveling all over the place together. And I just hope that a year from now that we're all just as friendly as we are here tonight. I'll drink to that. HARRY: Let's not break down and cry about it, Aunt Casey. I will if I want to, you bloody ape. Truth is, he's just a jolly good meal ticket, that's all. HARRY: And we tailed him for, oh, I guess it was a couple of hours. CASEY: No, 40 minutes. No, it was 40 minutes. Well, we finally sprayed him. We gave him five grand. Yeah. All counterfeit. The whole fence. Hey, Sandy, would you come up and have a little nightcap? I want to talk to you. I want to talk with her. Yeah, okay. Well, good night.Good night, Casey. See you tomorrow. Good night, Casey. You don't have to, you know. I don't have to what? Come and have a nightcap with me. I know. It's after hours. MAN 1: Hello, Harry. MAN 2: Come in. Hello, fellas. MAN 1: Sorry to interrupt. You want it in front of her? Honey, these gentlemen are detectives. We were just about to have a nightcap. Join us? I'm working. I'd like a little brandy. Been in town long? No, not long. Oh, we heard three weeks, maybe four. Oh, yeah. I like it here. Doesn't matter. Time to go. If I had the kind of life you've got, Harry, chance to move around, see the country, I'd do it. What's going on here? I haven't made any noise. I paid my dues. Three or four weeks is long enough, Harry. People begin think you live here. MAN 2: That's right. Go on up to B.C. where folks get all the money. Yeah, okay, I'll think about it. I like you, Harry. Don't push back. She 21? 23. And I've got I.D. Just another little thing for you to worry about, Harry? [DOOR CLOSING] Does this happen often? Once in a while. I guess you better go downstairs and start packing. We leave first thing in the morning. Okay. I'm sorry, uh... Well, you wouldn't have scored anyway. Good night. Good night. Come on, Ray, move. They're gonna go without us. He's not gonna leave without you. What's that supposed to mean? You didn't have to go up there last night. I told you nothing happened. Now, if you don't believe that, there's nothing more I can say. I know nothing happened. You didn't have to go is all I'm saying. You didn't have to let me go. So shut up about it. I don't tell you what to do. That's right, you don't. I'll do whatever I want. But even if I do, you don't have to put up with it. Thank you, sir.You're welcome. [HORN BLOWING] CASEY: If you ask me, Harry, it's the credit card that's downed the economy. As soon as we get rid of those little plastic bastards, the whole thing'll pick up. HARRY: Listen, Casey, the credit cards are not gonna go away. No, if anything, money'll disappear. We'll all be a number in a giant computer. Do away with money? That's ridiculous. Ah, it'll happen. CASEY: Communistic. HARRY: It's economics. It's criminal. [INAUDIBLE] [HORN BLOWING] SANDY: Oh, it's beautiful. HARRY: This is where we'll work. Where the money is. Where we live. This is where the class is. It looks like there's a lot of money here, too. Yes, my boy, but you don't steal where you live. Nice to have you back, Mr. Durban. Thank you. You want a girl, Mr. Durban? Yes. I'm sorry. It's all right. Don't make such a big deal out of it. Never happened before. Hey, come on. Well, not often. You're tired, that's all. My nerves are shot, too. Yeah, I guess that's it. Reminds me when I was a kid in high school. Our basketball coach used to get us in the locker room, and he'd tell us never to have sex before a game. He said it weakened you. In high school? That's dirty. [LAUGHING] Yeah. But he did it. He was a pro. Just like Harry. Harry's a bastard. Yeah. But he's a pro. He's a pro bastard. I'd like to have seen you when you were in high school. Big basketball star. All the little Indiana cheerleaders hot for you. You jealous? Green with it. Hey, listen, if we make a couple of really big hits, and get a stake together, maybe we ought to get married. Yeah, sure. And have six kids, and you can go out and steal every day, and I'll have dinner ready when you come home. Yeah. I'll make it someday. I know you will. Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. Thank you so much. It fits perfect. Thanks. [GIRL SCREAMS] CASEY: Would you two be slightly interested to know just what we took in today? SANDY: Yes, indeed. $1,420. $1,420. When it's all in small pokes like it was, that's definitely a dobby day. Congratulations, children, to us as a team. And did you notice that Ray didn't make a single mistake all day? CASEY: I did. I did. You know, you reminded me of the first time I saw the great Iranian dip, Angel Fingers, at work. It was in Paris, before the war. Which war was that, Casey? The Boer War, you silly ass. [ALL LAUGHING] Ray's hands are slightly larger. Angel Fingers was only approximately 4'11''. Nevertheless, their techniques are remarkably similar. Yeah, but he was a cannon. I'm still only a stall. Harry, my boy. Good evening. Thank you. Chivas Regal water back, please. How'd we do? $1,420. And the biggest poke was a hundred and a half. So we took a hell of a lot of leather in an eight hour day. [SIGHS] 1,400. I think that's pretty damned good. Fair. Oh, Harry, they're beautiful. Oh, wow. Nice. Was I supposed to say something else? No? I propose a toast. To Ray. Didn't make a bad move all day. To Ray. Even his timing was pretty good. Actually, it was damn good, Ray. Oh, that's nice. Thank you. Say, listen, Harry, maybe tomorrow you could start teaching me how to dip. Well, come on. You just finished saying how good I was. No. Oh, come on, Harry, you know... No, not tomorrow. Not any time. [UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Will you turn it down? Sandy, will you turn it down? It's bugging me. [MUSIC STOPS]Off. So what'd he say? What does he always say, nothing. Just no. He has a headache. Feel like going to a movie? No. It's depressing in the morning. We could make love. We already did. Well, you know, there have been occasions in the history of the world when it's been done more than once in 24 hours. Look, let's just try and get through the day, all right? Can I make an appointment for tomorrow? I don't feel like having sex. "Know me." What? You don't have sex with me, you know me. It's right there in what you're reading. I think I'll go out and ask Harry if it's okay if I wander around and check things out. You'd ask Harry if you wanted to go to the john. I'm sorry. I guess I'm just beginning to hate hotels. Hi, Casey. Oh, hello, Ray. I understand Harry's down with another one of those migraines. Yeah. How about it here, a little tea or sandwich? No. No, thanks. Actually, I was thinking about going out and working on my own. Oh, come on. Don't make an utter ass out of yourself... You were gonna say, "Again." I did okay before I met him, you know. Look, you've come a long way, my boy. And Harry would never stand for it. Oh, screw Harry. I've got to learn how someday. He's not gonna keep me around forever. I'm here because she's here and you know it. Anyway, I don't plan on being anybody's kiss ass stall for very much longer. Oh, I didn't mean that. I mean, with you it's different, Casey. You're his friend. I know precisely what you mean. If it's the milk of human kindness you're looking for, my boy, Harry ain't the cow. You know as much about this racket as he does. How come you work for him? I don't work for him. We're partners. My hands aren't what they used to be. How would you like to work behind a duke like that, huh? I keep up my end and Harry knows it. You could teach me how to make it as a cannon. Yeah. I could, but I won't. Harry would go up the wall. Well, forget Harry. You could teach me how to do it right. I won't get that chance again. No one will. You're right there. God knows there aren't many left who really know this profession. That's what I mean, Casey. You're the only one who could teach me how to do it right. CASEY: It doesn't change a jot. I like that part of it. It's a stable occupation in an unstable world. You see, it's all character, human nature. I can spot a good mark just by his face. But as you probably don't believe in human nature, you haven't noticed it at work. [BELLS CHIMING] My boy, you can't teach what I know. Not half. But I'll tell you this much, you wanna learn a man's character, after his face, look at his pockets. I can tell a man's state of health just by his kicks. Now there's a science not many have studied. Body oils. A fat man's pockets are always slicker. And it's not just the poor bugger who's got the dirty ones. [LAUGHS] I've stuck my hands into some pretty fancy kicks in my time, and pulled them out... Wow, shocking. You never know what you're gonna find in somebody's pocket. You've got a lot to learn, my boy, if you want to work the right class of people. You've got to associate with the right sort of mob. But you can't do that unless you're willing to learn the game. I'm willing as all hell. Oh, sure. Not enough. There's no sense of craft anymore today. Harry apprenticed for years. He was turned out by John Orlando. One of the finest. John started in the old country. Even worked the boat that brought him here, so they say. Nowadays, youngsters haven't got it. No patience, no discipline. They don't want to spend the time to learn. So they rip and they run, and they hit some poor old lady over the head and grab her purse. That really pisses me off. Spoils it for the rest of us and it shouldn't be allowed. One has got to have good training. There are rules. One has got to have discipline. Without it, you fall into all sorts of bad habits. This is... This is different, you understand? My age, it's... You know, it's good for you. Good for digestion. Good for the blood pressure. How come Harry never gets on you about that? Ah, my little weakness is cocaine. Harry's is me. [BELL CHIMING] [CHIMING] [CHIMING] Try it again. RAY: Hey, isn't this where Black Bart came from? HARRY: Yes. RAY: It's funny. We probably steal more than he ever did, but nobody ever heard of us. CASEY: Good lord, I hope not. Excuse me. [BELL TOLLING] Great. You were beautiful.Yeah? Score's 650 so far. Good. Let's quit. Why? I don't wanna get caught. I haven't made a bad move all day. No. I mean, by Harry. Oh, forget Harry. HARRY: Casey. Look at the watch on Ray. How'd he get that? Knocked it off, I suppose. No, he couldn't do that clasp. Maybe he made a good investment. I think he's holding out on us. Oh, I'm sure he'd never do that. No? Not a chance. Nah. Hey, man, what are you doing? What is this? What do you think it is? People.They're marks. Pictures of marks and personal effects you've skimmed from the pokes, right? Yeah. I like to study them. I like to know something about the people I steal from. Stupid. Did it ever occur to you that these are all evidence? It occurred to me, yeah. How long you been holding out, Ray? I've never held out. You're wearing $1,400 worth of watch on that wrist. How could a punk like you afford that, if you haven't been holding out? It was with my own money. I worked on my own time. Did you? Well, let me tell you something. You don't have any "your own time." You work for me, you follow the rules, you turn in everything to Casey... Don't give me that crap about the rules again. You let Casey walk around with coke. Now that's a federal bust. How does that fit into your rules? Okay. You don't want to play the game my way, you don't have to play. Go down and see Casey. He'll pay you what you're owed. All right, I will. Sandy'll come with me. Now wait a minute. I think you better ask the lady. Well, maybe somebody better ask me something. What does that mean? Why should she want to go back on the streets with a loser like you? You shut your mouth. Ray, don't! You swing on me, I'll kill you. All right. Stick with the old guys. Ray. Ray. Does that make you feel big, all that? It was bound to happen. He doesn't have it. I don't mean that. I mean, using me against him. Oh, you did that. What do you mean? You've been having it both ways. You could have turned me off any time you wanted. Okay. I'm gonna go get him, try and make him come back, and if he doesn't, I'm going with him. [DOOR OPENING] I heard the row all the way down the hall. Yep. Did he tell you I've been teaching him? No, he didn't have to. Oh. Still he didn't. I think he's got a lot more to him than you realize, Harry. Oh? He's young. Yeah. They're both young. Well, I like them both. Yeah, I know you do. Look at this. Hi. Hi. We're not going to be with Harry forever, you know. Just until we know what we're gonna do, so we can make it on our own. Yeah. But I don't have to take that crap from him. It's not worth it. Ray, please come back. I'm afraid. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] I sold the watch. Come on, sit down. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly clumsy. Are you okay? No, I'm fine. I'm fine, just fine. What's her name? Wanna go play in there? [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] MAN: My wallet! WOMAN: What's the matter? I can't find my wallet. I had it. Look in your purse. Why would your wallet be in my purse? MAN: You had it.WOMAN: It's not... WOMAN: How much money did you have?The credit cards... Oh, don't worry about the money. It's the credit cards, don't you know, my driver's license, everything. Wait a minute. What's going on? My wallet... WOMAN: I need some help. MAN: Help me. I need some help. [PEOPLE CLAMORING] WOMAN: Get the police! You have my wallet. This is my wallet. Policeman, get him! WOMAN: We need a policeman! Here's my wallet. Right here. What's the trouble here? This is my wallet. This man had it right in his coat. No, no, that's my wallet. Sir, let go of this gentleman. No. I want that wallet. That's mine. POLICEMAN: You'll get it back again. [SIGHS] Look. I don't know how it happened! The poke was suede. It must've got hung up in his pocket, but he should have checked it. I don't wanna talk about it. Look, Casey was stoned out of his head. He should have been paying attention. You're always making mistakes, Ray. Then why did you bring me back? I wish to God now I hadn't. Okay. That's it. Where you going? None of your goddamned business. I'm not coming looking for you again. Don't bother. I'll be back. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come on in. I'm on the phone. Hello, Jerry, I don't have that much right now. It'll take me a few days to raise it. Yeah. In. Don't try the diminished capacity plea. It won't work. It'll only embarrass him anyway. Yeah. I know there's very little you can do, but whatever he wants, he gets. Right? Yeah. Okay. Well, I'll call you when I've got the money. Couple of days. Okay, Jerry, thanks. Bye-bye. He'll wanna look his usual elegant self in court, I imagine. Can you get him off? They found some coke on him. Oh, Christ. Bound to happen sooner or later, I guess. A very expensive legal fee. You care a lot more than that. Well, let's see, he was the only family I had. Traveled around a lot together. We're just gonna go away and leave him? Yeah. That's it. He's such an old man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [CRYING] Sandy? Do you want a cigarette? Pardon? Cigarette? Yeah. What do you think will happen now? Oh, I guess we can go to Phoenix or Denver. Someplace like that. What about New York? Did you ever work in New York? No. Too many amateurs there. Person's liable to get mugged. Where were you born? Where did you grow up? You know, I figure you're a black sheep of a very rich family. [LAUGHING] Well, your manners, and your style and everything. Dirt poor. Poor white trash. I learned it all. Really? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] RAY: Sandy. Sandy. Do you care? Sure, I care. Sandy tells me you're short on fall money for Casey. Yeah, that's right. What do you say? I'll work with you one more time, then I'm finished. Okay. Ray, listen, about Casey, don't blame yourself for that. It's all my fault. Wanna drive? Thank you. All right, the score should be big here, but so will the risks. We'll be careful. She does all the stalling, Ray. I steer, make the hit, pass off to you. Right. You skin the poke and count up after each hit. I wanna work fast and get out of here as soon as we have enough.
