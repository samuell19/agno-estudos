Let me listen to your lungs. Turn around Breathe in and out as I tell you Breathe in Breathe out Deeper breaths. Breathe in Breathe out Breathe in Breathe out So, what's wrong with him? His heart and lungs seem fine to me What did you bring him in for this time? His arms... His arms are redder, doctor His body, chest and neck too Did you apply the cream I prescribed? Yes, in the morning and evening Did you clean his lesion first? Well, we bathed him And you applied the cream after his bath? He wasn't in the sun, was he? No, he stayed inside - Are there any more sore spots? - As you can see, around his heart - Anywhere else? - On his back and neck as well His body is all red Why don't you answer yourself? - He can't speak - Why not? His throat hurts Then let me examine his throat Let's see what's wrong Open your mouth Stick out your tongue Say "Ah". Louder - Is it necessary? - I'm just looking - His throat hurts - He seems fine to me But he's in pain Nothing's wrong with him Are you really in pain? - Can't you talk? - No he can't, doctor How long has he been like this? - Since he was a child - Quite long... Did you use anything besides the cream I prescribed? - Show her the cream - I bought this I bought it after yours ran out Why didn't you come to me for more? - And what is this? - I thought they were alike This is just regular moisturizing lotion It's good for you, but not for my patient You need to use my cream Look, your lotion caused his rash to spread Let me do a blood test. His rash has spread too much Why didn't you do it the last time? It wasn't this bad then You should've done a thorough examination last time I told you it wasn't this bad then You see what your cream did? Clench your fist Clench it Tighter Here's money. I've go to go. Take care of him To the factory, please How's Sirote these days? He's good. But he's very busy with work - So he's OK? - Yes, he's fine How's your dormitory business these days? Not so great. Some people moved out and no one has moved in Is it a dormitory for men or women? For women only Why don't you take in male tenants to increase your income? I think it'll be a big headache Men drink and get into fights. I won't be able to control them You don't think so? But I'm sure you will earn more in this difficult time Well, I'd rather leave it the way it is How's your health lately? All right? I take your pills and just fall asleep I have no romantic mood left. I just sleep These are all I have left They are anti-stress pills They help you relax. But they are not sleeping pills But my neighbour said they were strong anti-depressants Well, who do you trust? Me or your neighbour? I trust you of course - Is your neighbour a doctor? - No You have to trust me if you are in my care They're just for stress. Nothing more They might make you slightly drowsy Have you been meditating as I advised? Yes, and then I fall asleep Doctor... Could you issue a health certificate for him, please? What do you need it for? To certify he is in good health So he can apply for a job I can't. I need to see proper identification first Did you bring his ID card? I'll have Sirote bring it in later I need all the proper documents first Can't you just issue it now? Sirote will bring the ID I really can't. It's illegal Doctor, will I be addicted to my medication? If you follow the prescription, you'll be fine I won't have to take it forever? No, you won't need it once you get better It's just to relax you But when I take them, I don't feel like fooling around with Sirote I'd still like to have a child. Don't you remember? You want a child? Do you still want to have a child? Yes, I did seek your advice before Well then, when you want to... sort of... You mean have sex with Sirote? When you don't want to sleep all night... ...don't take the pills When you need them, take them. You'll be fine You really won't give us the health certificate? I can't Please, we've known each other for so long Please... I'll have Sirote bring the ID card later I really can't break the law. You should know I can't The total for both of you is 220 Baht Please excuse me I need to see my next patient. Number 12, please I have been your good customer I really can't Any card will do Even a driver's license will do. Then I'll issue it for him Excuse me, I have to see the next patient See you later - Please, doctor... - Number 12 please Oh, it's you. Hello Let me talk to you a bit more, please, doctor My next patient is waiting. Let me see him, OK? Hello How are you today? Ah? How are you? Ah?

Let me take a look at it Just a quick look Thank you Please, the doctor has to see the next patient Just give me a second - What for? - I need to talk with her Then please wait outside. She is seeing them right now I won't be a bother, I promise Dad, did you take it out when you washed your face? What? No, I just washed my face, but the water didn't get into my ears Please, just wait outside Maybe you can help me. I really need a certificate It's nice enough that she treated him... - What are you doing? - Help me out, please I was here before you were born. You won't get in trouble This is already making trouble for me Yesterday, we were watching TV and Dad had the volume turned low I asked him to turn down his hearing aid... ...so I could watch TV with him, but he refused So I turned up the television volume Then he screamed and complained that it was bursting his ears My dear doctor, my daughter played a trick on me Now my hearing aid is broken No I didn't. I just turned it down and it broke What? I just turned it down. That's all But there's this ringing sound I don't know why it's ringing. All I did was turn it down Let me try it again Dad, did you do anything to break it? Doctor, try saying something See? I can't hear a thing. Just a ringing sound - Maybe you blew out the speakers - What? You probably turned it up too loud and blew out the speakers But this model doesn't have speakers But yesterday, he went to the barbershop His friend showed him a new hearing aid - So now dad wants a new one, too - It's possible My dear doctor, if you want to have a child... ...I advise you to have a son Boys are much better with electronics than girls - Girls are silly and selfish - Silly? You just want a new hearing aid, don't you? But it's... You should've given me more discount Just a moment Does it itch? Orn... - Where's his girlfriend? - It's my turn today There is another recipe... It's really like this Weekend snack... Chicken Roasted in Beer Ple, where did you go last night? I stayed home Weren't you in a sexy mood... ...like the other night? Min, wait here Why didn't you say what I told you to say? I did. But she wouldn't issue it without an ID card I thought you were friends We are. But it's an official document. She can't do it just like that I really tried You have to beg her It won't work What should we do then? Use your connections Move him to another place Where can he go? It's up to that girl, Roong But she's paying us a lot of money That's true. Speaking of which... For the food and medicine Will you eat lunch with me today? I can't. I promised to take Min to see Roong at the factory Why don't we eat, then I'll take you there That's OK. I can go by myself Sirote, the doctor said... ...suggested that we try to have a baby - You want another child? - Yes, I still think about him And I'm getting old I think... ...it's better to wait a while Wait. I've been waiting so long The doctor also said you should have a check-up I'm afraid if we have another child... ...it will drown again I promise that won't happen How about this? We'll go see her together next week Fine. I'll go see Roong now Don't be too long. And hurry back What are you doing here? Is there anything I can help you with? It's lunch hour.

See how dedicated she is You should have seen our doctor here But the doctor is close to my house, so I stopped on my way If you don't believe me, she can show you the doctor's certificate That's OK, but there's something else That Burmese man with you, he was fired So I don't want to see him around here Orn, did you bring your gardener here again?
