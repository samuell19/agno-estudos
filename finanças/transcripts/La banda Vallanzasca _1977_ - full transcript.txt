How can I say this? If you don't find me a good lawyer... I'll stay in prison forever. I'll die in here. My little angel. Don't put yourself down. We'll find a way, you'll see. You look thinner. Don't they feed you? It's not the food. I'm missing a lawyer... You haven't understood a damned thing. You need money to find a good lawyer... Don't you understand? You know how much I care for you... You're the only person in the world who means something to me... Look at this. -"I love mum", it's so beautiful. I had it done here in prison for you. -Poor thing. So I can be close to you day and night. Don't say these things. You'll make me cry. God damn it, I need a lawyer... Do something, whore yourself. Just get some cash or I'll kill you... Understood? Have I explained myself? I'll kill you. Calm down, my boy. Be good. I'll work the streets and I'll get you a lawyer... Don't be so nervous otherwise you'll get a headache. My little angel... Don't get upset. Do you miss me? -A lot... I brought the fruit you asked for. Pineapple, your favourite. It won't be the same as when we ate it together. I know it. Are they treating you well? Have you been unfaithful to me? They're treating me very well. Like a real lady... Sorry, I meant gentleman. For the rest, you don't need to ask... I'm faithful, you know that. Otherwise I'd never have ended up here. Don't humiliate me. Forgive me. I forgive you. There's a bad atmosphere in here. I don't like it. I don't like it. Those bastards are everywhere. Especially here... I've had a premonition. I need to get myself transferred... Straight away. They got to Solnello. Don't worry. -Try saying that to him. I don't know him. -They turned his ass into a bucket. Time to leave. Visiting time is over. Touch me. -Always touching. Let's go. -Don't push. I've decided. I'm going to hang myself... ...and I'm going to do it right away. Thank God. At least we can sleep peacefully now. Don't show me because I'm very sensitive. Are you comfortable? Would you like another pillow? Hey, kamikaze. Do you really think they'll far it? Sure, when someone's insane they get sent to the hospital. I'm not insane. I'm going to hang myself... ...then I'll be sent to the hospital. Just save me at the right moment... Not too soon and not too late. -Don't worry, hang yourself... We'll take care of it. I don't mean to insist but be ready to call the guards when I say. Here they are. -Hey, you... They're already here. Cavalli, get your things. You're changing cell. Get a move on. Why are you transferring me? Hey, friend. We won't eat you, have a seat. Come on, let's get this over with. -What's got into you? Tony swore he'd get me. You're making a fuss about nothing. What are you talking about? Stop acting crazy... We don't know anyone here. We've just arrived, we got five years... We don't want any trouble and we aren't looking for it either... Sit down and put that thing away. Then you aren't Tony's men? Who knows this Tony? -We all have to live together... So let's try to get alone. You don't have to worry about us. Why did they transfer me so suddenly? How do we know? Listen... Let's have a chat about this, okay? It's not like we don't have the time... If anything we've got too much. My name's Franco. I'm Italo. Roberto, to my friends. I just hope they don't make me suffer too much when they do come. It's over for me. -You haven't got it... How many times do I have to tell you? Give me that thing and forget about it. Italo... They gave my woman permission. I'll finally be able to see her. Are you married? -Almost... We have a son together. Don't get married? -Why not? Because they're all sluts. It's because of a woman I'm in this mess -What did you do? I found her in bed with someone else and I shot her. I was wrong, I know that now. -For killing her? No... I should've shot him as well. Who would he be? Tony? That's why you were scared. I get it now... He sleeps with your woman and he still thinks he's right. It's not only that. To get revenge... I made him pay with the same money. but I made a mistake... Guys like Tony never forgive. Even in prison, they've still got power. What's going on? Don't get involved. These guys are serious. They're killing him. Quick, bring him over here. Drop him. A warning for you two. Your friend hung himself alone... Try not to forget. Otherwise you'll end up the same. What a mess! Let's try and do something. Get him down. Hurry. There's nothing more we can do. He's dead. What happened? Let me see him. If you've killed him you'll pay dearly for this. Hold him. Let go of him. Take care of the other one... I'll take care of this one. You know we didn't do this. -Let me go. This all ends here. I'll pretend I didn't see anything. No... You're going to get us out of here. We'll never make it. -Invent something, that's your problem. As soon as you cross the road they'll catch you. -One more word and I'll kill you. You're young, don't throw it all away. -Make him stop talking. Enough. Remember... If I see you doing anything funny you'll be the first to die. Don't forget what I told you if you value your life. We're here. Tell him we want to speak to the governor Where are you going? To see the governor. Open up. Help. We made it. I know a place. It's just outside Rome. Stop. Stop here. Let's go. Finally. At least we'll be safe here. We worked so hard to break out of prison to end up in a shit hole like this... Not bad for a first attempt. -What are you thinking of doing? In the meanwhile, we have to find some new clothes. I'll take care of that. I know a place nearby... It will be easy. -Okay, great... ...and when we get some artillery I'll show you how to do things... I can't wait. -Fine. Give me all your money. Yes. Here. Don't spend it all. I'll give it all back with interest. -Be careful, Italo... Come back if there's any sign of trouble -Yes. Roberto... Wake up. -Damn it, I must have fallen asleep. Sorry. You still haven't told me how you found this place. Simple. A pimp I know sends his girls here. Then let's get out of here before it starts raining condoms. Nice clothes. Where did you get them? The Salvation Army? -Wise guy. Where will we get the guns? -There's a guy, Riccardo.. He's expecting me. He's got a place outside Rome... They say his stuff is high quality. Will we go there now? -Sure. Who is it? There's someone there. Are you ready... -What's wrong? Roberto. I'll kill you. You bastard, I'll kill you. What have you seen? Talk! Roberto, let's get out of here. I don't want to go back to prison. - Thank you. - Thank you. I want to thank all of you friends who have honored me and gave me great hapiness on a day like this... To share my joy along with Don Calogero's, which from this day makes this big family even more united. Well said, Don Saverio, well said. Always with the permission... ...of these dear friends, I invite my daughter to dance. Where do you think you're going? -We're looking for Riccardo. Riccardo. Come here. Are you Riccardo? -Yes, that's me. Well? We need some special equipment. What do you want? Leave me alone. I don't talk to people I don't know. Besides, I don't know what you want. We need guns, Pino said you could help. We got out of prison yesterday. Pino, the Mafioso? -Exactly, that's the one. Who can verify this? You can always check. -Okay, what guns do you need? We need a couple of good pistols. -Do you have the money? That's not a problem. Follow me. There you go. As you can see, there's choice... I've got all types. This is a light machine gun. It's incredibly accurate. -We're not interested. I understand. This is a splendid pistol. It's small but very powerful. It's reliable and discreet. No... No. Maybe this one. It's a Smith and Weston. Let me have a look. -There you go. It's beautiful. It's old but it's still very efficient. It's never let anyone down. Give it to me. It's the jewel in my collection. Isn't it splendid? It's more faithful than a whore in love. -Okay, I'll take it. And you? Take a look at this... It's a P.38. That will do. -It never sticks. Nice? Ammo? -As much as you want. How much do you need? -Two boxes. Here, a loaded clip. You can have it for free. You've been very kind. The cash. 100,000? (Lira) Now, we're even. It's better to go shipping together with you. I told you there wouldn't be any problems. Let's go away now, let's run away. - Ehi, wait. What's up? Did you see all those people out there? Let's clean them out. It's not a bad idea. Those doormen didn't look so tough. I'm thinking about my career. What if all those people are big shots? It could also be suicidal. Let's go. Come on, walk. Don't move or we'll kill everyone. Hand over all your money and jewellery. Keep calm and nothing will happen. Hurry up. What are you waiting for? Don't move! Take your wife outside. Playing the tough guys. What were you thinking? Who are you, shitheads? Where do you come from? I didn't think there were chipmunk here. And I don't remember inviting you. If I'd known, I would have greeted you in a different way. Dressed like that? In my presence. Long hair, dishevelled... What an embarrassment. Shall we serve some dessert? The heavy one that's not fattening. It's a disgusting thing to me but... ...having to do with such two bastards, let's offer him to them... ...and, for God's sake, spare no expense! Take them away! Get them out of here! No one is getting out of here. I advise you not to move. What... What the fuck is happening today? Can you tell us where we are going? -Somewhere safe... You're in good hands, don't worry. Why did you help us? What do you want from us? Not answering? I advise you not to insist. Just rest, we'll talk about it tomorrow. You'll find everything you need here. I'll be back soon. They thought of everything. Who could it be? -How do I know? Who is it? -Friends, open up. Who are you? Calm down, I'm a friend. My name's Sandra. The organisation sent me. The one that saved your lives. You've got guts. You demonstrated that last night... Although some might say you went a bit too far. That's enough, I want to know exactly what you want from us? We know you were inside for armed robbery... We'll get you in with the professionals, but it's going to cost you... There are a lot of people we would need to silence... But we're ready to pay. The organisation thinks you... ...would be a great asset. In short, we want to hire you. We need people like you. All you're missing is a boss to guide you. I don't need a boss and I'm not part of anyone else's headcount. Perhaps I didn't explain myself clearly... Behind you, there would only be someone suggesting a safe hit... ...and what to do. -Look, you explained yourself well... Fact is, it's me who doesn't want to be second to anyone. You can earn a lot of money. I'm talking millions. Here are the keys to a Ford fiesta parked downstairs... Between the car and suitcase I brought you, you'll find everything you need... We await your answer. Talk to your friend. What do you say, Roberto? We don't want to work under someone. Of course not. So? You know what we'll do? We'll steal the car and all the cash then we'll get out of here... I want to see my woman. -They're watching us. I know, but we've already agreed. They're waiting for me to appear. This isn't so bad. I thought it would be worse... Read what they said about us. We really look like two actors. It must be that one. Come on. Relax. After these splendid clothes... Let's see what else Santa brought us. There's everything here. Your new license... Perfect, I'd say. It looks real. This should be mine... Exceptional. Nice. A P.38... Your favourite. And this is for me... Smith and Weston, short barrel. She even left us her name and address... It might be useful. Where are we going? If want to see if I can find my woman. She's got a friend for you as well. Thank you. You're very kind... But shouldn't we contact the organisation first? What do we care about the organisation? We'll let them show themselves and then I'll lead the game. People of our rank only ever end up dividing the crumbs... I'm not risking my back... ...for small change. -But those guys don't mess around. What have we got to lose? We're already in it up to our necks. I don't you've fully realised. The police. What will we do? We'll stop. We've got our documents. Why are you worried? Good morning. Your license, please. You know you shouldn't overtake on a bend, don't you? Wait a moment. See? What do we do now? -Don't get excited. Check their documents. -Okay. Roberto, they're going to recognise us. Go and see what's happening? Italo. What are you doing here? -It's a courtesy visit. Then you've decided. And your friend? He'd dead. Got any stuff? Not at home. Tell me what happened? Nothing exceptional. Things that happen every day... I killed a couple of cops, and they killed Italo. 2-1 to me. We're even, don't you think? You're like to win, I notice.. - Sure... I always have and I always will. Now, be quiet... I feel like making love... I always feel like this afterwards. Is there anything to eat? -In the fridge. Where are you going? -I'm not on holiday, sunshine... Recreation is over. It's time to get a move on. Don't talk to me with that tone. Do you think I'd risk being accused of complicity for your pretty face? I like risks... The more the merrier. However... Let's talk business. What do you want from me? I'll explain immediately. We're a large organisation... We deal with kidnappings. We make lots of money with little effort. What do you think? -What would I have to do? Listen, you've got the entire police force looking for you... I don't think you have much choice. We're offering you a job and in return we'll give you our protection. If you accept we'll start with the first kidnapping, you'll get 30%. I want to talk to the real boss. No one knows who the boss is. I advise you not to insist. We only communicate by phone. Very well. I accept. Whatever you say but I want 50% Why did they ask us to meet them here of all places? One place is the same as another. For us... This is neutral territory. The professor will fix everything. The professor is going to have to be very persuasive this time... After all that's happened, talk is not enough. We'll go in heavy... Someone's going to pay, professor or no professor, on my mother's grave... Justice will be done. -What I can't understand... ...is why they've done all this for those two small time crooks? It's simple... Someone's trying their best to disrupt our triangle... Perhaps it's the Marsigliesi or the some foreigners... There's no doubt. All I want is the satisfaction of seeing him vomit all that bitter poison... ...they made me drink. Why are they taking so long? Who are you calling? Where were you? -The ones from the organisation? Where have you been? Did anyone see you? -If you really want to know... A ton of people. For such an imprudence we may pay a high price, don't you understand? A small false move is enough to screw us over! Listen to me carefully: I didn't escape from a prison to enter another one! And it won't be a woman like you to tell me what I have to do! And if things are no longer good for you, tell me... and I'm leaving right now! - I don't like you! I never liked you. But I like you. You're keeping me sweet because they asked you to. I get it. -That's not true. Then you do like me. This way there aren't problems. Now, calm down. I didn't betray you. I must say they know how to choose people... Making love to you... Makes me forget everything. Good morning, commissioner. -Good morning, doctor. Good morning. What have you discovered? Initial tests indicate they've been dead for two days... They were brought here and burnt. We managed to reassemble their ID's... We're dealing with Enrico Salerno and Franco Cologero. Who would've had the balls to do something like this to them? They must have been professionals. What if it was that guy who escaped from prison a few days ago? We can't rule it out. He seems to be looking for all the sensational hits. There are people in this world who have nothing to lose... Just like our friend. Right. -Very well, let's go. Listen... -Commissioner? Keep an eye on the bodies until the coroner arrives, we're heading back. You'll meet our men tomorrow. It's all been arranged. One moment. I choose the people I work with. If you don't like anyone you can replace them with someone from the organisation. We don't want outsiders. -What about me? That's another discussion. Evidently, they trust you. Right... I was forgetting. One more thing... If you get caught you cannot tell them you were part of our organisation... If they ever get to me, I'm just your woman... Just your woman. Got that? That's why they ordered you to sleep with me. Right, that's why. Who's really in charge? Tell me the truth. -I don't know, to be honest... I receive my orders over the phone. I told you, let's not talk about it. ...and in return they give me all this, and a few million a year to live on. That's enough for me and I don't ask questions. Is it the Mafia? -Stop this discussion. Listen carefully... They agreed to your 50% for all the jobs you manage to complete... We'll start with a kidnapping. They will take care of all the details. And me? Who will give me any guarantees? Your great grandmother? You'll rip me off. You'll have to trust us. They've never betrayed anyone. Tell your bosses I'll be free to pull out at any time. I'll tell them. -I also want some blow. That won't be possible. We don't want any drug addicts. I'm not an addict. Look, it's Salerno. Do your friends know anything about it? They want to make you a big shot. You've got all the credentials. A few people, better, no one could afford to face Salerno in his base. And you did it instead. But it wasn't me who killed him. People like a man who has the guts... ...and you have shown you got them. Whether you killed him or not... They're just details. This is how legends are born. MOVE OUT! MOVE OUT PLEASE! You really made me sweat blood for this interview, didn't you? Three days and nights stuck by the phone waiting for his reply. I'd given up hope. Tell me, why did you want to come here? Wouldn't you prefer somewhere quieter? Or do you like cars? Isn't it too dangerous with all these people around? They could recognize you. Not to mention the police, there could be about a hundred officers all around. And police cars have too many reminders with identification pictures of you. Do you know they were given the firing order at your sight? Sure. But police don't like to shoot where there's a crowd. Moreover it's easier to escape. So...so will we start the interview with some questions? Talk shortly about your life, how everything started, why... ...your experience of prison, circles you hung and hang around with... ...and your escape. Did you bring the stuff? So it's true what they say. - Why? What do they say? They call you 'the bandit easy to drugs'. Write about me whatever you like, except that I'm a drug addict. So why did you ask for that stuff in exchange for the interview? Cocaine doesn't have someone go nuts too much. It's also true that a professional wouldn't ever need to take drugs... ...but that pinch of powder before a robbery gives you the right push. Enrico Salerno and Franco Calogerio. Do they mean anything to you? I don't know them. -Maybe we'd better start at the beginning. There's not much to tell. Snatches, thefts, then my first robbery. I got tired of being a stooge, so I started to hang out with the big circle... Mixing with the so called 'gentry'. Also there I had to rise through the ranks. I supplied drugs and sometimes young girls to some individuals. Give me some names at least. What hell am I going to write about? It's not the right time. -Why? They already screwed me over once. -How? I kept quiet to save the guys above me. The result: A charge for a robbery I hadn't committed... I was wrong not to say their names. This time I won't make the same mistake. In my hands I've got, so to say... A credit card. A guarantee... If they try to screw me over again, well, this time I'll drag all of them. That's the typical logic of a hunted animal. It's understandable on the other hand: a socially dangerous individual... ...a very high danger to society. You're an evil hero by now. I don't give a damn about what the others say and may think. I don't trust anyone and I only take care of my interest. Then, if you journalists increase sellings thanks to my name... ...that's your business. Is it possible you've been indifferent to all this exposure you got? Another man, in your place, would feel like a Dillinger restored to life. With the difference that Dillinger, if I'm not mistaken, came to a bad end. He was killed by police while coming out of a movie theather. - I know. Because someone betrayed him. That thing won't happen to me. But now I want to tell you an event of my life. You'll make a good impression on your editor in chief. Why did anyone keep in touch? Good citizens are more rotten than petrified corpses. So that stuff... Show me. Is it pure? Can I trust you? Sure you can. It would be worse for you. Come in. - Roberto? He hasn't arrived yet. Let's go upstairs. That's the case with the guns They delivered it this morning. The boss has arrived, guys. Let's hope he wasn't followed. If we get caught with all this they might confuse us for revolutionaries. She isn't doing too badly for herself. Hi, guys. I got held up... I had to kill two men in self defence. Salerno? Then it was you who killed him? Pino! -Okay, okay. No stupid questions. -Fortunately, they couldn't use a gun. I picked up some of this. Anyone want some? Pure? -90% A little sniff is the best medicine. That's what I say as well. -Roberto... We need to go over it again. -Why do we have to waste time? I told you, it's a walk in the park. We've been talking about it for days... ...and tomorrow we'll go ahead as planned. If anyone here isn't onboard, tell us. Who's our guy? -It's not a man... It's a woman. What's her name? -Her name's Antonella Carreri. The daughter of the famous oil magnate. 15:30. What did I tell you? Every afternoon she leaves her house at this time for rehearsals... Let's go. Move it. What's all this noise? Still nothing. -They'll call later. It's still too early. She's only been here five minutes. She's awake. You've kidnapped me. -If we aren't playing hide and seek... I'd say so. Don't move unless you want to be tied up like a salami. Pino. -Please don't hurt me. Here. Put this on. Do I really have to get changed in front of you? Listen, slag. Perhaps I didn't explain it clearly... I order and you obey. You don't look so innocent to me. I advise you to keep quiet. The game won't last long... It all depends on your father. When he gives us what we want... We'll return you safe and well. -I want to talk to my father. I told you to be quiet. I'm saying it for your benefit. I'll be quiet. No one will lay a finger on you as long as you behave. Hear that? There's also some stuff to read. Come on, hurry up. Can I go next door? -No, you don't move. Listen to me... From now on you'll have to put up with us day and night. Turn around at least. -Do you know how to cook? No, I can't. I'm sorry. You'll learn. You'll learn how to cook and do lots of other nice things... Beautiful. She doesn't want to eat. They're always like that during the first few days. This is it. It's the news. She won't die of hunger. You'll see. They're talking about us. It's finished. I'd like to go to the bathroom... Please. -I'll take you. Can I be alone? If you need a piss... You'll do it in front of me. What's your name? Don't you read the papers? -What did you do? I killed a few people... But it was in self defence... They were all people like me or policemen I'd never shoot a civilian. -You're a killer. Some people say I'm a megalomaniac, The product of a world gone to ruin... It's all crap. I was born to be a criminal... The rest is all bullshit. No one is born a criminal. It's something you become. Why did you kill the first time? -I was on the run. You've been in prison? -Sure, lots of times... If I'm crazy it's because I spent so much time inside... I can't describe what it's like in there You have to live it... Immersed in violence all day. Everyday. One thing is certain... I know I'll never go back there. Are you sure of yourself? -Very sure. I save the last bullet for myself. They'll never take me alive. -How do you live like that? It doesn't bother me. I didn't ask for it. -Who did, then? Are you comfortable? Do you want another cushion? Listen... I'd like to go to the bathroom... Alone. Okay. There's nothing left. The coffee is also finished. Don't worry... We should get some supplies today. And some news. They said they've made contact on TV. -Let's hope they hurry... It's starting to be unbearable. Listen... Can't we give her an injection? -Not yet, it's too early. We'll decide tonight... If we start on the drugs and this drags on... We'll play for her. Are you asleep? -No. You must sleep. You've been awake for three days. How many days has it been? -Have you lost count? I don't really know. I prefer not to count. I don't want it. -Why are you like that? You can't keep on refusing. Take it. No. Don't make me use force. You'll never make me. -Look, patience has a limit... I thought we were friends? -My friends aren't murdering bastards. Then this murdering bastard won't let you go to the bathroom alone. I couldn't care less. -Very well... As the lady wishes. The supplies have arrived. Who is it? -Catherine... I hoped it would be her. -Why? You'll see. Okay? -Everything's fine. Did you bring the newspapers? -They're in the bag. Where is she? -Next door. I don't want her to see me. She won't see you. Come next door with me. Any news? -It's going well. I'll give you the best fuck of your life. All these days alone, I... -You can't go on? Right? I'm going insane. It's been over a week. Of course I will Kiss me. Sorry to interrupt your honeymoon... How do we stand? -It's all okay, we asked for 3 million... ...and they accepted. Payment should be anytime. We don't know exactly when. -Let's go. Help. Let go of me. What were you trying to do? Trying to fool me? If you try that again I'll kill you. I'll kill you if you do that again. Your father will find you in pieces. Move it. You've got to do that little task as soon as possible. I'll do it right away. -And do it properly... They don't like mistakes. -Yes, I know. I wouldn't want you to confuse my kindness for weakness... I advise you not to try that again. You aren't a bad person. Take me back home. Listen, fool. Now you're exaggerating... Enough. -Hey, big boss... Catherine's next door. I prepared it for you. -How could you? What the fuck are you saying? Go on. It's waiting for you. Send her away and I don't want to see her here again... Understood? -Okay. At your command, boss. Want me to wash your back? -No, thank you. Then... Somewhere else? Get out. Leave her be. Who's going to touch her? Who will look at her? What? -Aren't you engaged? When are you going to talk to her parents? Get out, idiot. -Okay, okay. Thank you. There's no need to thank me. I didn't do it for what you're thinking. If it was down to me he could have you, but we also have rules... While I'm here they'll be respected. Any news? -Nothing. Eat, you. Damned television. I can't believe it doesn't work. Do you know anything about it? What do I know? We're completely cut off. We need to plan ahead. It's been two days without any news. Two days, understand? Why haven't they come? What are they waiting for? I have to know what's going on. Calm down. I can't wait any longer. -Let's not lose our temper. Stay calm. They'll turn up. I'm not waiting anymore. I don't like all this... I'm going to buy a newspaper. -No, Roberto, wait. Listen carefully, I'm sure they'll be here by tonight... Got that? No, don't go. Listen to me! Fuck you. Hey... Have you got a boyfriend? I bet you've got more than one. Yes... I'm sure... ...they've had a good look at you, right? Don't touch me. -Don't be afraid. No one will find out. Not even Roberto. Leave me alone. I'll tell him what I saw. What? And what did you see? Nothing. What's this? Blackmail? I told you not to touch her. What did you want to say? What have you seen? Talk. What have you seen? Talk. It was him, yesterday. I saw him... He broke the television. It was him. No, it's not true. Whore. It's not true. Don't listen to her, she's a liar. Why? Why did you do it? I'll kill you. -Wait. Wait. I'll explain everything... We didn't want her to know. Take her next door. -Yes. Finally, you show up. -Bad news. What happened? -Her parents aren't paying. What's that meant to mean? -I'll explain right away... The magistrates have gotten involved. They've blocked her father from paying. Otherwise they'll charge him with being an accomplice... We're fucked. You'll have to kill her. No one touches her. We've got to hurry. This place is getting hot. The police could arrive at any moment. -Trust us, the girl must be eliminated. No one is going to hurt her. I give the orders now. -You're crazy... The order has been given. You must respect the rules. I don't take orders from anyone anymore. Please... I'm begging you. Please don't kill me. No, I won't kill you. Your boss has made a big mistake... Send him my greetings and tell him what I told you... Go. Move it. We've got to get out of here. Where are we going? -To see a friend. To do what? I'll ask him if we can hide there for a few days... He shouldn't refuse. I need time to get organised. I can't take it anymore. Let me go. Be quiet. Where's Peter? -In there. You need to put us up for a couple of nights. You know all the police are looking for you and not only that. Yes, I know. That's why I'm asking for your help. Why don't you just give her back? Those bastards double-crossed me. They wanted me to kill her... They wanted me to think the ransom hadn't been paid... ...but it turns out they paid it last week. Have you heard the latest news? -What are they saying? The police arrested a terrorist. Looks like it was the person... ...who killed judge Andreatta. He had part of the ransom money. About ten million. -It's all starting to make sense... That's what they were hiding. - Look... This game is too big, go and give yourself up, Roberto. At least you can save your life: people like that don't joke... They have no pity. I always play to the last round. What are you going to do? I don't want you involved... Thanks all the same. Is anyone else here? -No. You weren't expecting me, were you? -Roberto... You thought I was already dead. -Don't say these things. I haven't stopped thinking about you. We made love... Why have you come to my home? Your friends won't look for me here. Why have you still got her? -Are you sure you don't know? Will you tell me what happened? You're friends were trying to run away. I want their names and you'll tell me. I can't help you. -I want to know who's in charge... You'll tell me or I'll kill you. -I don't know... I swear I don't know. I got my orders on the phone. Then give me the phone number. I don't know it. It's always changing. Then how do you know? -The day before, a notice in the papers. It's always a pay phone number. Leave the girl, Roberto... Save yourself. -No... I want to unmask all of them. I'll tell them their names... ...to defend my freedom. It's my only hope. It's too late. Why? The police are already here. They've been watching me for days. You made a mistake coming here. Come and have a look. Damn it. Listen, Roberto. You've got to save yourself. How can I? I don't know where to go... Tell me where I can hide? I'm begging you. Okay, okay... Go out the back window. My car is outside. Get on the Prenestina... (motorway) 40km down you'll find an abandoned western film set... You'll be safe there. I'll join you as soon as I can. Why are you doing this for me? -I've got a score to settle. Okay, I'll be waiting. There shouldn't be anyone here. They'll never find us here. I hope not, anyway. As soon as I've gathered myself I'll show those bastards. I can't go on. Please let me go home. I decide what to do. Quit busting my balls. Do you want me to let them get away with it? How can you take control? They're all against you. You're all alone like a dog. I want what I'm due and they're going to give it to me... No matter what it costs. I've never been second to anyone... They'll pay. You'll see. He's fallen into our trap. Sandra has done well. We need to draw him out. Come on, let's have some fun. It's the organisation. It was another betrayal. Be damned, Sandra. I don't see them. Roberto... I don't want to die. Show yourselves. Where the fuck are you? They'll kill you. -Relax, they're not going to kill anyone. Roberto, come out. Don't be a hero, you can't do it. There's no way out. Surrender. Leave the woman and come out with your hands up. No, I'll never surrender. Fuckers. I'll kill you all. One by one. I'm begging you. Okay, lunatic. We'll get you out. I can't take it anymore... Let's get out of here. I'm begging you. Stop it. Stop. I surrender! Don't shoot. I surrender! You won. I'm a little lamb. (Lit.) The important thing is saving my skin. Can I lower my hands? -Sure, get comfortable. Roberto! Why did you kill him? Why? Damn you. Commissioner. Doctor Beppe has arrived. Good morning, doctor. -Good morning. What's your hypothesis, commissioner? We'll need to see the autopsy report to determine if it was murder... ...suicide, or an execution. I'm going with the second hypothesis. I'm practically convinced of it. (?) crime by an innocent... ...will exasperate public opinion more than it already is. Sure... It's more like South America. Our country is moving further and further away from Europe.. Always more. The same situation as Uruguay in 73' A corrupt party. A strong left... More and more audacious clandestine organisations... Public opinion shocked by crimes and kidnappings like this... Life is getting more dangerous. First they'll introduce special laws... Then the army will get involved in keeping public order... In the end, the people will revolt. -Aren't the special laws ready? I want the case report immediately. I expect it in my office. Good morning. Okay, doctor. Good morning. Subtitled [rarelust]
