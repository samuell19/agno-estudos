There's an alley in a town in Bin County named Shi Public Shrine. An old mansion lies in this alley. It houses the descendants of Shi. At one time, they were the wealthiest family in the area. But a tragedy happened 20 years ago. 13 members of the family were killed by bandits. Only the son and his mother survived. At their resident, 13 corpses were dumped inside... a dry well behind the house. Since then, a series of strange incidents have occurred. Some said the corpses disturbed the Dragon King, hence the incidents. Some sold the corpses disturbed the Dragon King, hence the incidents. But these are Just rumors. Today is the 50th birthday of Old Madam Shi. It's celebrated on a small scale as not many family members are left. - let's wish mum a happy birthday. - OK. Mum. happy birthday.

The heart broken daughter-in-law died soon after. - Only the two granddaughters Yumei and Yulan. were left behind. They were raised by Old Madam Shi. As only a handful of family members were left alive. -Jinhua and Mingming, together with their parents. the aunty and uncle of Yulan and Yumei.... moved into the mansion... moved into the mansion... so that the-old madam wouldn't feel so lonely. They could keep her company day and night. Come, say your prayers to the gods. Do it yourself. Uncle Quan Today is the first day of the month, Qiao. Go inside after you've said your prayers to the Dragon King. Help me burn off the ingots. I've been up since 5am to cook. Now I have to go back In to make soup for the old madam. She'll be as noisy as a ghost if I'm even a little late. I'm not as free as you. Don't mention the word "ghost" so early in the morning. It's unfortunate that I bumped into an unlucky ghost like you. Ungle Quan, the. old Madam. wants me to give you a hand. OK, burn off the Ingots. Other families pray on the 2nd and 16th days of the month. and their servants are rewarded with a feast. The Shi's pray every 1st and 15th day of each month. I'm dead tired. Why do you keep saying the word "dead"? Say something nicer. Dragon King, bless us that all of us in the family will be safe. Ghost! Old Madam, there's a ghost! Shut up, Yu. Haven’t you learnt to keep your mouth shut after all this time? First Young distress, I know. But I was terrified. The curse of the bloody frog has come true. 15 years ago, my son died. 15 years ago, my son died. Your mother died soon after. Today... I don’t know what'll happen. - What's going on? - What's with the noise? What's going on downstairs? Why is it so noisy? Who's making all that noise? - What happened? - Honey. - Yes. So much noise in the morning. - Shut up! Uncle Quan, what happened? What happened to you, Uncle Quan? Your head is covered in blood. Uncle Quan. go clean up in the kitchen. Let's go downstairs. What happened to Uncle Quan? I wonder if Uncle Quan is possessed. possessed? How? Mingming! How many times have I told you.. To keep a tight lip on the 1st and 15th day of each month? Father, why did we move here? Father, why did we move here? My grandma wants to have more men in this house. 60 year old Uncle Quan is the only man here. So she asked Uncle, Cousin Brother and you to move in. I'm terrified of stuff like this. What's there to be terrified of? Just keep your lips tightly shut. Don't go around yelling and cursing others. Even if there is a ghost. You won't be possessed. Uncle Quan, what did you do? Where did you get this dead crow? You put such a dirty animal here? Uncle Quan, say something to her. You just cry all day. Cut it down! The sight of you just kills my appetite. Why do you like yelling at others? I’m not yelling at you! It's none of your business! Do you want to die? Grandma, are you OK? In-law. are you OK? Yumei, wheel grandma upstairs for a rest. Yes, take a rest upstairs. Yumei, I told Qiao to make her some chicken soup. Let me do it.

Stop talking nonsense here. I'll put some ointment on. Get some scissors and cut her hair. Yu. bring me another tub of water. How are Qiao's Injuries? It’s strange, The fire was huge. But her injuries are not serious. Her back looks slightly red. Yu, bring me a wet towel. Mingming, dress her up. Mingming, dress her up. Qiao.. Aunty, how’s Qiao? Is she OK? She is fine, Strangely, she was badly burnt. But there's no sign of any injury. Is this true? - Yes. - Is this true? - res. What's so strange about that? Maybe she was possessed by a ghost.

Mr Xu, we pay you to give tuition... not to bully a child, Aunty, Mingming is wrong this time. Women should keep a distance from men. How can you blame Mr Xu? Stupid girl! Come upstairs with me! Sorry, Mr Xu. That's OK. The bloody frog. Uncle Quan! The blood frog... The Young Mistress claimed to have seen the bloody frog. The bloody frog? You wouldn't have known this.

No one has ever yelled at me since I was born. You have the guts to yell at me! You're dead! You have the guts to yell at me! You’re dead! Mr Xu! You hit me? I hit you. So what? Get out of here now! - Mr Xu. - You have no right to hit him! Sister. This is the study. Don't fight in here. Why do you talk to me like that? We're family. Cousin Young Master, being impartial is more important than family. Stupid maid, you have a razor sharp tongue. I'll beat you up! I'll beat you up! How dare you? I don’t. Just joking. Get out. Got out... Get out! Sister, Mr Xu is leaving Talk him into staying. Mr Xu is an understanding man It’ll be fine. -after I've apologized to her. -Mr Xu. -It’s OK. I'm sorry. Second Young Mistress, carry on with your lessons. Don't stand in our way. First Young Mistress and I have to cook. Sister Yu, take this chicken soup to the old madam. I'll help you with the dinner tonight. I feel bad that you have to make dinner by yourself. -Cousin Mistress. -What's this, Yu? The chicken soup for Old Madam. I'll take it to her. Never mind, I can do it myself. It’s about to rain. Go collect the clothes on the rooftop. In-law... Come In. Come in. In law, let me help you. It's OK, Cousin. I feel bad you have to serve me. My family moved here to serve you. Besides, our relationship is about to get closer. Before he died, Brother-in-law betrothed Yumei to Jinhua. They're a match made in heaven. Jinhua fears Yumei. like a mouse fears a cat. Your granddaughter will never be bullied by her husband. There's something I forgot to tell you. What's that, In-law? What's that In-law? My granddaughter, Yumei, for the sake of our family, has chosen to remain single for the rest of her life. What? Yumei wants to stay single for the rest of her life? What about Jinhua? How can you take an oral promise seriously? Even Yumei doesn’t know about this, Come in. Cousin Mistress you're here as well. I'll excuse myself for now. I'll excuse myself. Uncle Quan, are you here to collect the household expenses? Yes. The money has run out. Didn't I just give it to you? Yes, I know. But it wasn't enough. Uncle Quan, how many times have I told you? As the butler, you must be frugal. How can you waste the money? Yes, But I can't do anything if it's not enough. OK...don't say any more. I'll give you the amount you need later. - Leave now. - Yes. In-law, why does Uncle Quan keep asking you for money? You're not indebted to him. Yes. It's not a good idea to be too kind. I accommodate his requests since he is an old servant. But I didn't expect him to take a mile after I gave him an inch. He is such a character. In-law, regarding the matter about Jinhua... Don't bring that up again. Is the lift not working? Is the lift not working? Ms Yulan, have someone fix it soon. Otherwise, it'll be very dangerous. I should go. I need to finish my article at the office. OK. Mr Xu. -Umbrella. -Thank you. -Goodbye -Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr Xu. - Goodbye. Come inside! Come inside and we’ll find a solution. Why don't you wait a little longer? You can’t leave in this heavy rain. Uncle Quan, summon a rickshaw to take Mr Xu back. Second Young Mistress, rickshaws often refuse to travel here. More so in this weather. They won't come. - What should we do? - I don't know. Yulan. Yulan. Grandma, Mr Xu can't leave because of the heavy rain. Silly girl, just invite Mr Xu to stay here for the night. Mr Xu, tomorrow is Yumei's 20th birthday. You stay for dinner and leave later. Yes. Mr Xu, tomorrow is my sister’s birthday. Just stay here tonight, - Yes, don't go. - OK. I'll stay the night. Thank you, Old Madam. You took advantage of me last time! And I stayed silent about it! Now you're doing it again! -Go away! -Come on No! No! Come... Don't move! - No! - Don't move! - No! Come on. Cousin, you're a beast! Since you're so audacious... Help! Qiao, why are you naked? - What are you doing? - Help! - Help! - Sounds like First Young Mistress. How is it possible? Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! - What happened - Uncle Quan, who's asking for help? - I think it's First Young Mistress. - First Young Mistress? where is she? First Young Mistress died tragically. How did this happen? It's heading towards the well! - Let's give chase! I'll inform old Madam. think it's over there. Let's check it out. The monster escaped into the dry well. - Let's go down there. -OK. You’re not allowed to go! Grandma, Sister is dead. Grandma, Sister Is dead. Grandma Sister is dead. The monster has killed her, and it has escaped into the well. Don't say any more. Uncle Quan told me everything. It's a tragedy for our family. More than 30 years ago, 13 members of our family were murdered and dumped in the well. That offended the Dragon King, The bloody frog has shown itself. My son is dead. My daughter-in-law is dead. Now my eldest granddaughter, Yumei, is dead too. Grandma. Now, Yulan is my only surviving granddaughter. I don't want anything to ever happen again. Uncle Quan, lock the well up. Keep the keys. No one is allowed inside from now on. Don't cry. What should we do? Let's call the police. I don’t believe in ghosts. You don't believe? But all of them do. You're the youngest man here. Do you believe in ghosts? Those who have seen the ghost believe in its existence. But i've never seen it, so I don't believe in it. Inspector, I'm sure there's a ghost. Have you seen it? No. But something strange has been going on here. That lift. It moves up and down for no reason in the middle of the night. Grandma. Old Madam, how long ago did you install this lift? It was installed when my grandma became paralyzed. It has been here for many years. Both of you moved here less than a month ago, right? Do you know how to operate the lift? No. they hired me to cook right after they moved here. I don't know too much. Old Madam, I have some questions for you. OK, go ahead. I'll wheel upstairs. Let’s talk on our way there. You don't have to come with me. I'll take care of Old Madam. Inspector, can I leave now? I have to rush back to the office to finish my article. OK, OK. I wonder what the inspector is discussing with In-law? Who knows what the discussion is about? Jinhua did you see the monster with your own eyes? Of course I did. If the old madam hadn't stopped me from climbing down into the well. I'd have caught the monster. Brother, can you stop talking? Why didn't you tell the inspector when he asked you about it? Father, why are you such an idiot? Father, why are you such on idiot? If I said anything they'd want me to testify. You... should know it's very troublesome to act as a witness Jinhua is right, Talk too much and you invite disaster. Mingming, if you see anything strange, don't breathe a word. Dad, is it true that there's a ghost in the well? I said it’s none of your business! Don't open your mouth! If there isn't a ghost why did she seal the well? Inspector, why don't we,.,? - How is it, Inspector? - Nothing much. The old madam is in ill health. Yes. she had a heart attack before. How do you know? My wife used to be a nurse. It’s best if you can get a doctor here. I know. We will. May I ask you not to leave the county for the time being? Do you.... suspect us? According to the servants, they only heard strange sounds before. But since you moved here, strange things happen even during the day. So... Inspector, are you trying to say that you suspect us? That is not what I mean. I just hope that you can help me catch this monster. How ridiculous! Complete nonsense! The ghost of the Shi family is on the prowl. We've become suspects. Mum, it wasn't easy to achieve.. your aim of moving here. What aim? Don't talk through your hat. Don't lie to me. The property of the Shi family. I know you and the old madam are the appointed trustees. Once the old madam is dead, the property will fall into your care. Once the old madam is dead, the property will fall into your care. am I right? who told you that? My mum, My mum told me that. I'm her son. I'm your son too. The trusteeship can be proved by legal documents. You must keep it a secret from outsiders. But why are you hiding it from your own family? Jinhua, shut up. Even if the old modem was dead, Shi Yulan is still alive. That's easy to deal with. Shi Yulan has to get married. Once she is married, the properties will belong to her husband. What has it got to do with you? Can't I marry Yulan? We’re maternal cousins. Not paternal cousins. Besides, I’m not your biological son. You have no right to control me, Beast! - What are you doing? - Remember, I'm not your biological son. If you want to strike someone, strike her! - You... - Leave it. - You... Leave it. -Get lost! -Leave it. Doctor, how’s my in-law doing? Her heart is rather weak and her blood pressure is quite low. Mr Ku, how should we take care of her? Your wife used to be a nurse. She is experienced in taking care of patients. This medicine is for the old Madam This medicine is for the old madam. Dr Ku, will you be visiting Grandma tomorrow? Tomorrow.. No, not tomorrow. Why isn't the lawyer, Mr Liu here yet? Uncle Quan has gone to fetch him. Get some rest Old Madam. Please. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Don’t go! You've already.,. What are you doing? Don't touch me! Let go! What's going on? He hypnotized and raped me. Now. that I'm pregnant. he wants to abandon me. Let go! Did you hypnotist and rape her? Jinhua, did you do that? I was trying to see if the hypnosis technique would work. Beast! You struck me? You have no right to strike me! You have no right to strike me! If you do that again, I'll get you back! I'll kill you! 'll beat you up, scoundrel! - Stop... Don't you have any shame? Dad Dr Ku! -No shame at all, - Dad! - No shame at all! - Dad! Dad, are you OK? If my mother hadn't married a poor thing like you. I'd be driving a sports car around. Do l need this to make a living? Bro, how can you say such things? you're an opium addict! If my mum hadn't given you shots and medicines, would you be here? You'd be long dead. Brother! Dad. Qiao, you’re fortunate that I want to have a dalliance with you. Don't try to humiliate yourself! What are you looking at? Who's sewing at this hour? What? You said someone was sewing in the attic last night? Yes when i went upstairs the machine was still moving. I even saw an outfit for a child. Sit down. That sewing machine was a wedding present when I got married. No one has touched it for decades. But I saw with my own eyes that it was moving. I'm not trying to scare you. But our mansion is huge. Anything could have happened. Don’t wander around in the night. Understand? You’re the only family i have left. Come, give me a massage. Second Young Mistress, why do you want to see me? Follow me to the attic. To the attic? What for? Just come. It's gone. Second Young Mistress, what are you looking for? An outfit for a child. saw it lying here last night. Really Help me look around for if. Second Young Mistress, there's an old photo here. What photo? Look. This is Grandpa. But the woman sitting next to him is not Grandma. Why? Second Young Mistress you mean the woman next to... Old Master is not Old Madam? it's not her. The genealogy of Shi Changsheng The fourth generation, the eldest son, Shangda. The fifth generation, the first wife, Pan Xianshu. Sixth generation, the eldest son, Guozhong, also named Junda. Sixth generation, the eldest son, Guozhong, also named Junda. Isn't this my father? Born 1900. Date: 9th day of February. Date: 17 July, around 7 to 9am. Aged 20. My father died when he was 20 years old. -My sister, Yumei, died at 20 years old too. What's with the coincidence? Where did you find that photo? I found It In the attic with Yu last night. I found It In the attic with Yu last night. You went to the attic with Yu? Yes, I was afraid so I asked Yu to accompany me. Sorry, Grandma. I disobeyed you again. Never mind, silly girl. I'm doing it for your own good. You're 19 years old now, I no longer have to hide it. I'm a concubine. I married into the family... after the death of your grandfather's first wife. That's why I'm not the woman in this photo. Oh! So that’s the reason. Grandma, there's something else I am intrigued about. What is that? I found the genealogy of our family in the attic yesterday. It says my father died at the age of 20. You were still a child back then. But my sister died recently at the age of 20 too. Grandma, why is it such a coincidence that... They both died at the age of 20? That's a curse that the Dragon King has placed on our family. You have nothing to fear, Yulan, By the time you reach 20 years old, the calamity that befalls our family will be lifted. Grandma, you mean if the calamity hasn't been lifted when I reach 20, I'll die? Silly girl, when you're 20, I’ll send you elsewhere, Nothing will happen to you. Is that true? Yes, I saw It with my own eyes. What? Uncle Quan, Yu found a photo of the old master in the attic. Really? The woman sitting next to him is not the current Old Madam. - Not the old madam? - Shh. - Not the old madam? - Shh... Come here. Don’t spread rumors about something like this. If it gets out, we'll be in trouble. This is a family affair. As servants, we should stay out of it. - Get that? - Yes. Qiao, done with the soup? Cousin Mistress wants it now. Hurry up and make it for her. Yu, I have an errand for you. Come with me. This blackguard took advantage of me and I have to make him soup? You have a good appetite. Chicken soup? I'll save some for myself. Blast it, Qiao! You saved some chicken soup for yourself again. I'll take a few sips. Yu, what’s happening to you? Are you having an epileptic fit? Yu, what's happening to you? Yu! -What happened? -What happened? - She's having an epileptic fit! - What happened? Tie her up first! Tie her up! Separate it with a cloth! Tie her up! Keep an eye here. I know, hurry up. Hurry up! Don’t hurry me. It’ll be done soon. Help! Help! Helpl Help! - Remove her. -Yes. What are you doing? What's going on? Tell me. In-law, Yu was bitten to death by that monster, Grandma, what happened? Grandma, what happened? Don't move, Old Madam. Pull me up! Don’t be afraid. Why are you stopping me? None of your business, silly girl. - Give her a hand. -OK. Stand up. It's OK now. Grandma, are you OK? - Are you OK In-law? - I’m OK. Mingming, Yulan, carry the wheelchair upstairs. Take the old madam upstairs for a rest. Hurry! Slowly. Fu, go survey the surroundings. Be careful. Mum. What do you want father? Why did you pour sulphuric acid in the old madam’s lift? How did you know? You can't deny it, I found the purchase receipt in your pocket. Yes, so what? It's less trouble if the old woman dies sooner. If she dies sooner, it'll benefit both of us. You’re such a beast... Leave it, sit down! - Darn! - Sit down. Scoundrel, get cut! Mum, I spent all the money you gave me last time. So soon? Don’t be so wasteful. I don't own a gold mine. Don't be so wasteful. I don't own a gold mine. Be frugal. I know. Father, this money Is to be used for gambling purposes. If you're unhappy, talk to Mum. Goodbye. It looks like you're involved in the sulphuric acid incident too! Yes, My son and I did it for your benefit. If Mrs Shi dies, Yulan is not 20 years old yet. With the letter of authority, you can act as the trustee. If you can steal two percent from the estate, it's more than enough. It's better than living in poverty' for a lifetime. What do you mean? Simple. You can endure poverty if you want. But the children and I aren't prepared to suffer with you. Where are you going? None of your business. Cousin Mistress, what can I do for you at this hour? Qiao. I know my son. Jinhua. took advantage of you. I'll report It to Old Madam. This is $300. You won't be able to earn this much even if you work for a lifetime. So, do you want it? You mean I'm not to report this to the old madam, right? Not just that. Take the money and leave this place. Stop working here, get that? For the sake of money. Uncle Quan. if a piece of wood falls out, it'll burn down the kitchen. Qiao, you died tragically. Isn't that Dr Ku? This is very strange. Your life is in peril If you want details, come to the cellar, 10pm, tonight. 10pm Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. 10pm tonight. The time is up. Why isn’t she here yet? Why? Open the door! Why is this happening? I'm bleeding. What is this? Help! -Uncle -Yulan. Are you sure you're leaving? Yes, you're on your own to take care of Old Madam. Mingming, father and I don't want to remain at this sad place. Yulan, this is a letter of authority to administer the Shi family estate. Once you reach 20 years old next year, you have the power to do so. If you want to know the secret, unlock the dry well and find out yourself what's down there. Take care. Mingming, I'll write to you. - Yulan, come with me down there. - OK. Don't worry, they're just skeletons. These are the skeletons of your family. There's nothing to fear. There should 13 skeletons. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten, eleven, twelve. Only twelve. There should be one more. Why is it so strange? There should 13 skeletons. This is so strange. Could it be that the missing skeleton is... the key to the secret of my family? Look, Mr Xu. There's light coming in. There seems to be a tunnel. Let’s go inside. Come. Rock.. Rock till Grandma’s house, Grandma praises my baby, Baby, go to bed. I Think it's a woman. - Let's have a look. -OK. He sleeps till daylight. Daybreak. Dong, my good boy. Mummy is here.

I look like this because I was bitten by the bloody frog. Why did you kill my grandma? Because she wanted to kill me to shut me up. Yulan, she is not your grandmother. And you are not a descendant of the Shi family. I'm your grandfather. What? She is not my grandmother? You're my grandfather? It can't be.. You don’t believe me? OK, I'll tell you a story. I More than 30 years ago, this area was in chaos. All the rich men were preparing to leave this place. Hurry! Come! Put this here! Pack up those things! Quan, have you summoned the carriages? I have. But they have yet to arrive. - Tell them to hurry. - Fine, I'll do so now. - Hurry up! - I'll do so now. Tell him to hurry. Pack up the things. Master, you forgot one important thing. What is that? That illegal child is your only son. You mean I should release Lian? Who said to release her? I mean I want the boy but not the mother. Good boy. Good boy. Give me the boy. Get him over here! What are you doing? Hurry up! This is my son! Give me back my son! Give me back my son! Hurry, take him away! Wait, take me with you! This son is mine! Let me out! This son is mine! Let me out! The bandits came. On that night, 13 members of the Shi family were murdered by the bandits. Even Lian's son was killed too. Then the soldiers arrived. They dumped all the corpses into the well. One by one, - They threw them into the well. Yes. - Hurry upl - Don’t throw him in! He is my son Xiao Dong... give me back my son! Xiao Dong... Give me back my son! Threw them into the well. Xiao Dong Is a good boy. Mummy knows you're hungry. I'll find you something to eat. Good boy, Xiao Dong, go to sleep. Lian, .12 members of the master's family are dead. Even the child you had with the master, Xiao Dong. He is dead too. They threw him into the well. But, I have a good idea now. But, I have a good idea now. If you'll work with us, It'll be profitable for both of us. Look, this is my son. Outsiders know that you bore the master a son, Xiao Dong. But no one knows he is dead. My son is of the same age as your son, Xiao Dong, right? If you treat my son as your and the master’s son, Xiao Dong, I guarantee no one will recognize him. So, you won't have to work as a servant for a lifetime. You can be the mistress of the family and live comfortably. Don't worry. I'll still play my part as the servant. But, I have to be clear. The Shi estate has to be divided equally between us. The Shi estate has to be divided equally between us. What do you think? The woman you called Grandma is... actually Old Madam Shi's maid, Lian. She witnessed her own son being thrown into the well. She had a shock and began suffering from mental illness. Every time she recalled her son, she'd go down to the cellar and hold the skeleton... as if her son was still alive. I took this opportunity... and thrust my son at her. You grandma's son is my son. Actually he is your father. For the sake of the Shi estate, any descendant of the Shi family,.. can inherit the estate once he or she reaches 20 years old. The descendants of the Shi family are actually my descendants. Your grandmother didn't want me to share her property. So she killed your father and sister... once they reached 20 years old, She killed everyone who knew this secret of the Dragon King legend. like Qiao, Yu, Cousin Master and cousin Mistress. She killed them one by one, Why didn't she kill me too? Because you've yet to reach 20 years old. But because you're very curious. You wanted to investigate the secret of the family. Your grandma feared that you'd expose her secret. So she hod been plotting to kill you a long time ago. A few days ago, I wanted to ask you down to the cellar... to tell you the truth. But your grandma was watching me. She even dealt with me first. Fortunately, I managed to escape. So, you’re really my grandfather? Yes, I'm your grandfather. My granddaughter. Are you really my grandfather? Good girl, I'm your grandfather. Grandfather! Good girl. Grandfather! Good girl, to save you, even if I had to kill and commit a crime, I have no regrets. Come with me and give yourself up, Mr Xu, are you OK? - Mr Xu... - It’s useless. He’s dead. Hurry, let's go. Mr Xu. So this is linked to Grandma's room. Hurry! Run, Yulan! Run, Yulan! Hurry! The steel teeth. It's you, Dr Ku. You wore the steel teeth and bit them to death. That's right. I wore the steel teeth and bit your family to death. I can tell you, your grandmother paid me... to dress up as a monster to kill all of you. Do you know I cured your grandma's legs? Her disability is fake. Young girl, it'd be a waste to kill you before I enjoy myself. And those bloody frogs. I told your grandmother to feed them meat. so that they'd grow teeth to bite your family to death. Bloody frog, evil curse and the deadly Dragon King... all these send a chill down your spine. Fortunately, the truth is finally out. Many people lost themselves and did evil things... for money. It’s hard to detect these mentally ill people... just by looking at them. Perhaps one is your neighbor
