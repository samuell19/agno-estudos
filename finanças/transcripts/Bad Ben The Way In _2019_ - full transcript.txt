- Hello? Yes, I just showed up. Yeah, I found it. I know what to do. Okay. Yes, Mrs. May, I'm going in. Here I go again. This is sad. Okay. So here's the story. You're probably asking yourself why I'm back here. Well there's yet another new owner of the home. Her name is Emily May. Mrs. May knows the history of the house and has hired me to come in and cleanse it, get rid of any ghosts or demons that are in here. And that's the real mystery. I thought the house was free of any evil spirits several times, but somehow they keep coming back or new ones show up. Why, that's what I aim to find out. For some reason, evil is attracted to this house. So here I am, Tom Riley, paranormal investigator, tasked with making this house suitable for Mrs. May and her family. Where do I start? Okay, let me check out these cameras. What the hell is wrong with this basement camera? Alright, I've been hanging out outside this house for the past hour and I've been monitoring the cameras on the iPad and I don't see anything happening in there. So I know you think I'm crazy, but I really need the money this lady's paying me so I'm going back in there. Alright, the basement's all quiet, so whatever burst through that door isn't here right now, at least I hope not. But I discovered two very strange things. Number one, there's a fire that was, it's burning out, but it was recently active in the wood stove. But even more mysterious, in all the times I've been in this house I've never noticed this room over here. Fucking smell in here. Somebody's been living here. That must be who busted through the door trying to scare me away. Oh. No doubt, that's their fucking shit bucket. Oh no, what is that? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please. No, please. It's a fucking doll. Look at this ugly little bitch. What, huh? Where did? Now things are getting really creepy. The ghost meter. Alright, let's see you do your job. Nothing. Nothing at all, which is exactly what we want. Set that over there. What the fuck! What the. Where'd you go? I know you're down here. Alright so two hours ago I was in this house and everything seemed calm. Then the door got busted off. Then I waited an hour, I came back in, I used the ghost meter, everything seemed calm. I have no idea how these things are getting back in this house, but it's apparent things are heating up and I gotta find a way to get rid of these things going on here because I need the money this lady's paying me. So what I'll keep doing is I'll keep looking around looking for anything strange, seeing what I can find out and dealing with it. So I don't know what to expect next. So I'm just gonna keep alert. I don't know what exactly I'm gonna do but I've been through this before, I know how to handle it, I'm not scared, I'll do it again. God damn it! Shit's too much! Yeah, shit's heating up alright. What the hell? Damn it. Ow, fuck! Alright. Okay. Ghosts, demons, whatever's in this house, I'm not fooling around with you this time. I'm getting right to the point, what is supposed to drive you out of here? Do not perform unless you are a canonized Catholic priest. Oh well, words are words. The power of Christ compels you. Jesus Christ. I'm gonna die. I'm sitting here waiting for power to come back on in the house so I can get out there and see what I'm up against. Doing this in the dark is not easy. Doing it in the light isn't easy, but anyway, I'm waiting for power to come back on. I have to get rid of whatever's in this house. I have to find out how it's coming back after it's gone. I don't understand that. How did I go from several years ago having a ton of money in the bank, my entire life savings, to buying this house and losing it and now working for the new owner and I'm sitting here locked in the laundry room on the first floor, waiting for a light to come back on. I oughta just walk away from this thing but I need this freaking money. Fuck. Give me that knife, you bitch. I am not making any progress. God damn it. Where'd you go? Hello? I'm down here in this creepy ass basement and after what happened with the dolls I ran upstairs to get this ghost meter and I came down, the dolls were gone. The basement door was open. I must be out of my fucking mind but I came down here looking for them. I can't find them anywhere in here and they're not in that other room I found and the ghost meter was active when I started coming down the steps, then it went dead. Jesus Christ, this fucking house of horrors! Hey! Come back here! Come here! Come here! Alright now, you and I are going to have a talk. This has been going on, look at me, this has been going on far too long. Where's your sister, driving around? I've got to document this. I don't know who's inside of you, what spirit or demon, but I've gotta tell you this has gotten out of control and I have to get you out of this house. So whatever spirit is inside of you, I command you to leave and if you don't I'm going to throw you in that fire downstairs and nobody is going to stop me. No, no, no, no! Oh God damn it. So, that's a claw mark. That's like a claw mark. I'm playing with dolls. I told her nobody's going to help her. In comes some demonic force. Smacks me down, at least for the moment it seems to be subdued. And I've got a claw mark, a hand print of Satan on my face. This is just great. How am I gonna handle this? I need this fucking money, God damn it. If I didn't need this money I wouldn't even be here, let her deal with it herself. But I am here and I need this. Man up. Nothing. Nothing. This meter is picking up nothing. It's like this what, these forces just come and go as they please. There's nothing. A couple minutes ago I'm attacked by some who knows what. I got some doll running around the house, another one driving around the house and now there's nothing. Spirits of the house, make yourself known. Whoa. What the hell is this? Some old painting. There's something inside of here. You're shitting me. What the hell is this? Why was this hidden behind this photo? This is a book from the Leeds family. And this crest here matches this exactly. This is like an instruction book for this house. It mentions evil, ghosts, spirits. This earmarked page, I am so lonely, I let them in, I let them in, I let them in, written over and over again. Talks about how to deal with demons. This, this is gonna be real interesting. So this book is just the book, this is the book on witchcraft and spells and demonology and all that that I've been using. This book however, is the specific book about this house. It mentions everything from the history of when the witch coven used to perform here, the rituals years, decades before this house was built here and it says that the demon that's leading these people, not to antagonize him but the commander of the 30 legions, his name is Andras. Christ! What in the mother of all fucks was that? What the fuck? Where did she get off to? God damn it. Hello? I gotta be out of my fucking mind. Hello? Fuck me. Play time's over, ladies. Okay, alright, showtime is running short if I'm going to complete my goal here for Mrs. May and get paid. I went, the book taught me a lot and I went looking for around the house and found this which is vital to getting the answer to an important question I need to deal with what's in this house or to rid this house of any sort of evil. The book tells me I need to find out how many forces I'm dealing with in the house that have come through the portal and the portal's what I'm going to look for next, but first I need to find out with how many demonic forces, ghosts, whatever I'm dealing with here in this house, which I know of two specifically which have taken possession of the dolls, which by the way you'll see there I have chained up and they're chained to the pipe that runs along the wood behind the wood rack there. So anyway what I'm going, and I know you're not supposed to play this game. I don't consider this playing a game, but I know you're not supposed to, according to the instructions, use this Ouija board alone. But I don't have anybody else here and I can't get anybody else here. So the specific question the book talks about me asking is Ouija board, how many malevolent forces are in the house now? So, here we go. Ouija board, hello? Okay, Ouija board, how many evil or malevolent forces, how many non-human spirits or evil forces are in the house now? No, no, no, don't go up there. Go down, go down, go down. Nine? There's nine I have to deal with? What the fuck? Do I have to deal with nine? Alright, it's going towards yes. So apparently there's nine evil forces I have to deal with in getting out of this house before I can consider it clean. So the fact is, it says I have to catch them and I have to bind them and then send them back through the portal. Well I've bound two of them but it says I have to send them through this portal that's in the house. Now, where the fuck is this portal? I've been over every square inch of this house. I'm looking through this book. It gives no indication of the portal, shows a tree. But there's a page missing out of this book that I'll have to find. Anyway what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to try to ask the Ouija board where this portal is so that I can send the evil back through it and seal it. Where the fuck? Okay, I got two of you, seven more to go. Fight's on, let's go, bring it. Listen, I need this money. I need to get rid of you. You need to get the fuck out of this house and this book's going to tell me how to do it. Oh fucking shit. Fuck my life. Fucking mess. Alright, let me try and figure out how to locate these fuckers. I got two of yous, seven to go. Okay, do not say his name aloud. Yeah, no shit. They will try to distract you, stay focused. To locate the demons and ghosts do the following, say aloud, priests only. Stay focused, stay focused. Ghosts, demons, malevolent spirits, in the name of Saint Michael I command you to make your presence known. They will try to distract you, stay focused. I command you in the name of Saint Michael to make your presence known. Fuck is it? Jackpot. Now, these are the voodoo dolls. But there's one, two. I guess this is three and four. Do you count as one or four? Fuck. Hello? Hello? What the fuck! What the fuck are you? Stop it. Stop it. Fuck, fucking stale. Stop it. Ow! Ow, fuck! Make sure to keep a firm grip on everything. They will try to, whoa! Don't do it, come back here, come back here. Okay, this is Tom Riley, paranormal investigator, trying to earn a few bucks. But anyway, I'm finally making some progress. You'll see, I've got the dolls chained up and locked up and I've got the voodoo dolls tied to them. So what I don't know, there's four voodoo dolls and the two dolls. Each of the dolls is possessed by something, so that's two. I don't know if the voodoo dolls count as four more or just one more, if they're individual entities or one entity. So I've either got three of the nine malevolent forces captured or I've got possibly as many as six of the nine. So that means there's three more. So everything, once it's down here, this freaking fire's still burning, I don't know what is putting logs in it and keeping it going, but here it is. As far as figuring out whether this counts as three or six spirits, malevolent forces, I need to find that Ouija board or that missing page from my book. So anyway, let me get going, whoa! Fuck! I tripped over that fucking stool. What the fuck is that noise? Get away from me! Son of a bitch! Fucking somebody help me! Fuck, this may be the last moment I'm ever seen alive again. I thought you were dead. Fuck. What the fuck! Well, this is the next one and I know exactly where you're going. Now that I straightened up down there I don't feel like having you guys fucking shit up. I got the dolls from up there but I don't remember if the ashes were still up there. Okay, phone's recording in Tom Riley's continued documentation of, the Ouija board. That's just what I've been looking for. And yes, those ashes are still up here. Be careful I don't break my ass here. Where's the Ouija? You know what, let me set this camera down. Tripod and get over here, let's see. That looks like the outline, there it is. The Ouija board. Now I can get some answers I've been looking for. What's, no, this is the missing page from the journal. The nine demons lured here by witches, and this is the dolls, which I've got. This one, and all their names are on here, this one is Yoko Ono or Yuki Ana. Ar-dat Lilly, associated with children. Well, it's a doll. And here's my answer to the voodoo dolls. They aren't four, shit, they're not four separate demons, they're one, a lee-gos. Made, what's this say? Made to represent, I don't know. Oh, they were made to represent former humans in the house, like voodoo dolls, but now occupied by demons. The Crescent Moon Clown is the demon Pay-ma. Full of energy and loud noises, colorful, bright lights make active. Yeah, they sure do. The music box, I haven't seen that, Mal-pess. I don't know what that word is, but reveals secrets of enemies. The ashes, which are here, are the demon Came. So these are actually possessed by a demon, which is what tried to hide this from me. Yeah, well that didn't work too good, did it? The vacated ashes of humans that used to occupy house. Demons are in the ashes now. The Ouija board, the communicator, this is that name I called when I got attacked and it's, that looks like what was chasing me. This name here, which I'm also not gonna say, is President of the High Council of Demons, rules the portal, king of fire, rules the portal for the underworld, it's the king of fire, look for fire. This is the missing page, so now I know the individual names of the demons. Let me ask you a question, Ouija board, where is this portal? Okay, let's do this this way. Ouija board, where is this portal? Come on, come on, do something. Ouija board, where is this portal? Oh, give me a break, let's try it this way. This worked before. Ouija board, where is this portal? Fuck, let me go get something to clean this up. And take with me. I'll be back in a. Okay, I got a dustpan here. What the fuck? It worked, it spelled out a message to me. O-S-T-V-E. O and E, what's that spell? V-O-T-E-S, votes? Votes, what the fuck does that mean? Anyway, let me clean this up. Fuck. What the fuck? Where did they go? What the fuck? I'm not going forward here, I'm going backwards! Where the fuck is this portal? Votes, votes, what the fuck does votes mean? King of fire? Fire, votes, the Ouija board didn't spell out votes, it spelled out stove, it's the wood stove! Okay, so here I've set up the iPad because in searching around here, hang on, I want to have this tripod. In searching around down here, here's the fireplace, which is like this eternal flame that's always burning, so I'm looking for the way in that the evil keeps getting in the house and of all the times I've been down here, I never looked back here, but here behind the wood stove is a door and I'm gonna try to set the phone up in my holder here on the tripod so I can show you this. Now, outside is the other side of this wall, but here you see a tunnel. I'm gonna keep the iPad running over there so that you can see me, see what's happening here. The camera in the basement is broken, so that's not filming anything so I can't look and see anything coming in and out of here nor can I take a see at what's feeding this fire, but anyway I'm gonna put my fat ass through that small hole and I'm gonna take my iPhone with me and record what's going on on the other side and hopefully I come back. Man, that thing's flaring up. So it's, uh, it's cold in the tunnel, so I'm going to go through there and here I go. Jesus. Well here I go. What the fuck am I doing? I have no idea what's on the other side of that door. Well that door is still open. Well, here we go. Fuck. I don't know where I am but the absolute feeling of dread and evil is unreal. Do you hear that? Now let me put this camera on the tripod so that I can, is that on there? Okay. So anyway, this is the door I just came through from the house. This has got to be the way that evil is coming and going into the house and here's what's even crazier, this tunnel I just climbed through, there is no tunnel. But when I open the door, you can see the tunnel. No tunnel. So anyway, I'm going back through here to get back to the house but this is the way that evil's been getting in and out of the house and if I can seal this, no more evil coming in and out of the house. Anyway, that's part of the plan. Oh shoot, what am I closing it for? Let's go. That wood stove's gonna feel pretty good after being out here but I'm gonna have to get these things to come back through this door and then seal it with them inside. Probably the only guy on Earth that's ever been in hell and come back or whatever the fuck that was. Alright, here we go, I can squeeze out behind this fucking stove. Fuck. Alright. So for now, I'm gonna find a lock. So for now, I'm gonna try to find a lock and lock that but I'm shutting all this shit off because I'm wet and I'm cold. I found it, that has got to be the way in, alright. Okay, I had to get out of that house and get a break. So I came out here to walk in the woods a little bit behind the house, just to relax. It's loud out here, crickets and all. But I've got my phone on the tripod, I'm just headed out here into the woods. I must be nuts, but I just had to get out of that house. I have no idea how I'm going to recapture these things and get them through that portal, but I'm gonna have to. So I'm walking back here. The quiet is deafening, the insects. Anyway. So I'm just back here. Back here near where the grave was of Ben behind the house. Try to gather my thoughts out here in the fresh air. Trying to figure out, oh the motion sensor light's on, that's what's up there. Trying to figure out how I'm gonna capture these demons and move on, it seems like every step forward I take, I take two steps backwards, so I don't know where I'm gonna go from. Did you see that? It's the dolls. Do you hear the music box? It's like they're taunting me. They're right there. I know who you are. And I'm going to put you through that portal. No, no, no! No, fuck. Where the fuck did it go? Where did it go? Oh, I don't need this bullshit. What am I doing out here? I should be home finishing that book by Kellen Geneva, Red Oak Lane. Such a good book but here I am. Sorry, whenever I'm nervous, I babble. Where the fuck did this thing go? I'm gonna go deal with this fucking thing. I'm gonna go deal with him right now. Okay, let's get this done. This is it. I'm running out of time. I had no idea this was gonna be this tough. I should've let Mrs. May hire those paranormal investigator hacks from Minnesota, Matt and Amanda Lamm-Hoffman. But no, I had to be a big shot and tell her I could do this. What was I thinking? Jesus Christ, what was that? Hello? Oh shit. Ben, help! Yes! Thanks, Ben. Got you. I gotta get all of you now. Got three of yous. Okay, here we go, using my trusty iPad. We're at the boiling point, folks. What the fuck, this is in Latin. Oh thank Jesus, here it is in English. Okay, here we go. To be read by a priest only. Well, we don't have a priest, so I'm doing it, so here goes. Demons, I cast you out. Every unclean spirit. Every Satanic power. Every infernal adversary. Every legion. Every diabolical group and sect. I will now call you by name and command you to be gone. First, I got this stuff, which I have already. Py-ma, the Crescent Moon Clown, enter the portal. Co-ball, the Ouija board, enter the portal. The rest of you I will call from where you shutter in fear, you cannot hide. Ar-dat Lilly, enter the protal. Get in there. Yoki-anin, enter the portal. Enter, get in there, you bitch. El-gis, enter the portal. Fuck you, douchebag. Oh, cock. Mow-pass, enter the portal. Yeah, we'll miss your music. Oh fuck, here we go. An-dras, enter the protal. And now I command the President of the High Council of Demons, the king of fire, the gatekeeper of the portal, Ad-rom-o-lick. In the name of Jesus Christ, enter the portal. Okay, that wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Wait, who am I missing? That was eight. Oh, the ashes. Alright, here we go. Came, I command you to enter the portal! Okay, locked and loaded, all demons cleared. Hello? Yes, Mrs. May, it's Tom, well of course you know it's Tom Riley. I'm happy to report to you that the house is cleansed of all evil, it's all gone. Well, what do you mean? Of course you could. You've been what? You've been watching this whole time? I've been getting my ass kicked by these fucking demons and almost killed and you've been watching and you've been live streaming it? A million hits? So wait a second, you didn't see what I did to get rid of all the demons, did you? Alright, well, no, I don't think it's funny. You've been sitting there streaming me the whole time, was this just for your enjoyment? Alright, fine, don't worry then. Hey guys, Ad-rom-o-lick, all of you, come on back in and party. Fuck this lady. Fucking, fucking all this work for nothing. You having a blast? You think it's funny streaming me? PlayStation four. Stream this, bitch. Fuck you.
