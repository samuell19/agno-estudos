Ever since I was old enough to know the difference between cotton candy and cotton blend I wanted to live in Manhattan. To this Ohio girl it seemed like the centre of the universe, and definitely the fashion universe. I knew I'd end up in New York one day, I just didn't know when. Like everything else it would happen when the time was right. And then one day fate walked through the door. Hi. Can I help you? Um, I'm just gonna takea look, thank you. Ok, well my name's Taylor, just holler if you needanything, ok? Ok. Heidi, both of these dresseswill look amazing on you, but when you go into that jobinterview I want you to feel strong and confident,not self-conscious. So you're saying I should gowith... this one? I think it's veryvice-presidential. Taylor, you're the best. Thank you so much. Of course! You're gonna be great. I hope so. I know so. How's it going over here? You're pretty sureof yourself. How do you mean? Well, either one of thosedresses would have worked for a job interview. Why the shirt dressover the pleated? Heidi's always beena little shy. I've known hersince third grade, so I thought she'dcarry herself better in something more classic. I see. See ya. Bye. Good luck! Thank you. Which one of these dressesfor me? Honestly? Mmmhmm. Neither. Neither? I think you need somethingbolder, you know? A richer, deeper colour. Bring out your striking eyesand your beautiful skin tone. I think you area vibrant winter. I don't believe in the wholeseasonal palette concept. I believe that clothes area personal expression. You know, a matterof mood. Royal blue, violet,and a pop of red. They'll look incredible, and they're all 20 percent off as part of ouralmost summer sale. Try them on? Why not? I swear, you could sellSnow Cones in a blizzard. ( laughs ) How do you do it? Ok, she's just trying,not buying. Let's hold the applause. Wanna bet she takes hometwo of those dresses? All three and you closeup tonight. Deal. Deal. What do you think? It's beautiful. I love it. I like it, too. How did you know? Taylor always knows. She's like a wardrobe psychic. Cookie? Home-baked this morning. Let me guess,your home? No. Baking is not my forte. That's, that's all Pam. I'm the decorator. I like your style, Taylor. All the way around. Thank you. Anything else I can dofor you? Yes. Come work for me. Work for you?Doing what? This. I own an exclusive woman'sboutique called A-Line. I'm trying to expand my brand and I've just been too busyto manage it myself. I need someone experienced, fresh, and talentedto take over. You interested? You don't know anythingabout me. I'm a good judgeof character. Where's your store? Manhattan. Man- Manhattan, like,Manhattan, New York? You know of another one? There's also Manhattan,Kansas. I'm just in Ohio for the daymeeting a vendor. Alyssa Stone. Taylor Morgan. Firm handshake! I like that. Alright, Taylor. I'd need you in New Yorkin one week. How about you buythe plane ticket and I will find you a placeto stay until you get settled? You've got 24 hours. I'm gonna leave my cardwith you. Let me know. Oh, and um... I'll take this,and the other two as well. Great. Don't you even think ofsaying no. You've been waiting forthis moment your entire life. ( inspirational music ) ♪ I don't know, I think thatdress looks amazing. Yeah. Cameron Diaz bought thatexact same dress just last week. Cameron Diaz shops here? Well, her assistant. But she said Cameron wouldtotally want to borrow it. And really, it's the same thing. What about this one? No. Hi. I'm looking for- Oh, are you lookingfor the bus stop? It's like 40 blocksdown that way. No, I'm not. I- We're with a customerright now but we'll help you super soon. I'm sorry, I don't thinkyou understand. Oh, I totally do. Don't worry, sweetie,we'll get you out of that and into something fabulous. Mindy and I areabsolute magicians. I'm sure you are. My name's Taylor Morgan. I'm the new store manager. ( laughs ) Your new boss. I think you're a littleconfused. Our boss's name is Alyssa. Taylor! Welcome to New York. I was expecting you hours ago. Girls, don't be rude. Say hello to Taylor Morgan. She'll be running the store now while I'll be working on thatexpansion I told you about. Uh... you never told us aboutany expansion. Surprise! Life's full of surprises. Get used to it. Oh, and here's another one. Taylor will be roomingwith you until she finds a placeof her own. Oh, Alyssa, that's- No, no, no. It's all settled. Why don't you come check outthe rest of the store? Right this way. Girls, customer. ( snaps fingers ) Right back here. Here we have mission control. Oh, or should I say"out of control". Um, why don't you put your bagsover here. So did you really nottell Courtney and Mindy I was coming inas the new manager? And spend a week lookingat their sourpuss faces because I didn't hireone of them? No thank you. But... living with Mindy? I- I don't even know her. A: there's not much to know. And B: she owes me big time. And it's just temporary. You'll be fine, ok? Now, this is where we keepour records, files... Statements, blah blah blah. And I need to get it together. Why don't we start here? Cinderella this up for mewould you, Taylor? Absolutely. I'm glad you're here. ( traffic sounds ) You're not in Kansas anymore. Ohio. Whatever. I'm from Ohio. Think of it as...extra cardio. Welcome to BuckinghamPalace. It's cozy. Where's my room? Your room? This- this is your room. I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was gonnabe a pop-up Airbnb. I'm sorry. I didn't know Alyssa hadn'ttold you what was going on. I feel really weird. Uh, you can sleep there, there's a fold-out couchbed thingy. Great. Oh! That's my little guy, Oscar. There's a cat. Yeah. Hi buddy, hi Oscar. ( growling ) Oh, ok. Oh, he'll warm up to you. ( upbeat music ) ♪ Look out, lady! Sorry. Sorry! ♪ ♪ You step out ♪ ♪ one foot in frontof the other ♪ ♪ Hoping your mind istoo much to discover ♪ ♪ Oh, make sense of it all. ♪ ♪ No, my bad ♪ ♪ no way from another ♪ ♪ Feeling so free ♪ ♪ just me and my lover ♪ Oh, make sense of it all. ♪ Why not try everything inthe store and then buy nothing. Ugh! ( sighs ) Like they say, the customeris always right. Well, whoever said thatnever met these customers. Shoppers can be tougheverywhere. You just have to try not to takeit too personally. Well, I do. I take a lot ofthings here personally. Courtney, I'm sorryif you or Mindy feel you should havebeen made manager. I really am. But I will be a great bossto you if you will be a great employee to me. You know, this whole "do ityourself" style of yours, it might have workedin Kentucky but I'm not sure it's goingto fly in a store that sells $3,000 dresses. I'm from Ohio, andif you can't have fun with what you're wearing,what's the point? I'm just trying to bea good employee. I am going to lunch. One pepperoni,one combo coming up. Okay... Tony will take careof you over here. Combo coming up, over this way. Yes, you got it, boss. Coming up. Come down to the register. Tony will take care of you. Yes, young lady. No. 2, pineapple and ham. Come down, Tony will take careof you over here... At the rate you're going you'llget served next Tuesday. I just want a slice of pizza. You're not from around here,are you? What, do I have a big neonsign on my head that says "you don't belong"? Sorry. Let me help you out. What do you want? No, I- that's ok, thanks. I'm good. Yo, Frankie. One small pie, half pepperoni,half mushroom. You got it, boss. You got one pepperoni,one combo coming up. It's not worth stewing over. The pizza's not that great. I'm sorry, do youneed something? Eternal life, world peace. Right now I'd settlefor a couple slices. You want one? Sure. Yeah? Here. Thank you. May I? Mmm, you're wrong. This is definitely worthstewing over. It is amazing. Thank you. I'm Philip, by the way. Who do I have the pleasureof eating with? Taylor Morgan. So, Taylor Morgan,where are you from? Where are you from? New York. Ohio. I just moved here to runa clothing store. Oh yeah? Which one? A-Line? Down the block? Yeah, I know it. Big time. Congrats. Thank you. First impressions? New York is-- I mean of me. I'm kidding. ( laughs ) Manhattan's the best. But you gotta manage it. Move faster, push harder,talk louder. It's the survival ofthe fittest here. Where are you living? Buckingham Palace? Is that a joke? A cubicle on East 7th. Put a key in the door,you break the window? Something like that. Got it. Well, it's your lucky day, because not only am I a pizzadelivery guy, I'm also a realtor. Is that your best pick-up line? No, I have better ones. But it's true. Here's my card. Yeah, you know,thank you, but I'm- I'll just find a place online. Ok. What? I already looked. There are like amillion listings. There are a million listings,exactly. Another one for the road? Sure. Thank you. You're cool, Ohio. Just remember:be yourself. Uh, see ya. Move faster, push harder. Move faster, speak louder,push harder. Whup! Ok, here's the goal. To open up three new A-Linestores in three years. That's one a year. Ok, but whatabout this store? To be honest with you we had at least twicethe foot traffic back in Ohio and a lot less going onout there. That's why you're here. To help me figure that out. But keep in mind, Taylor,the clock is ticking. Fiscal year is up in 60 days. If I don't show my investorsdouble digit growth, they're out. You mean no expansion? Exactly. It took me agesto find these guys. So let's make it happen. And uh, could you do somethingabout that storage room? It still looks like a bombwent off in there. Yes, I'm on it. Yeah, everything's going great. I just need to figure out a wayto increase foot traffic. The store is a little quiet. What was thatabout quiet? You would not believethese streets, Pam. They're... so alive. Unlike here. Talk about boring. Hey, you should do whatwe used to do to get people in the store. I'm not sure free home madecookies will really pack them in in SoHo, Pammy. Well, how do you know? It could be a start. Besides, you knowI can't bake. Oh, please. It's so easy my poodlecould do it. I'll text you the recipe. Worth a shot. ( smoke alarm going off ) Oh, no, no no, no! ( coughing ) Missoni, Kors, Prada,chocolate chip! Cookies? Free cookie? Hi. Oh, um.. Oh, a photo? Sure! Sure! Sure!! Cookie? Fresh baked cookie? No? Please join us for Manhattan'slatest fashions! Are those gluten free? Are they what? Oh... thank you. But they're free! They're free cookies! Ok. I'll remember that. Manhattan's... Go crazy. Thank you! I mean, I know it's not Ohio. I just thought... there's a human touchmissing here. Maybe something homey andfun would wake these people up. Taylor, you've seen the womenthat work and shop here. They'd rather jump offthe Brooklyn Bridge before eating chocolateand sugar. Unless you're binging,of course. So what are we supposedto hand out? Diet soda and cigarettes? The point is:know your audience. Speaking of which, it didn'tjust slow down here, did it? Do you think maybeyou're a little out of touch with your audience? Excuse me? Alyssa, I'm so sorry. I... I didn't mean it. I'm still finding my way here. I mean, what do I know? Look at all you've accomplished. I'm sorry. See? That's it. That's the real gimmickto get people in here. Honesty. Honesty with me, with yourstaff, with the customers. That's why I hired you. Don't disappoint me. I won't. Hmm. I think I love this. Don't you? Actually, I'm not sureit suits you. You're so wonderfullytall and graceful, I just don't think this showsyou off to your best advantage. Best advantage? So that when you walk inthe room all eyes are on you. And not the dress. Something with moreclassic lines. More elegant. More you. Alright, well, thanksfor your help. I think this Dolce & Gabbanawould look amazing. That's ok. I'll um... I'll look elsewhere. Thank you. ( fan buzzing ) ( sighs ) ( loud street sounds ) ( sighs ) I have got to find my own place. ( upbeat music )♪ ( upbeat music )♪ ( knocking ) Hi! ( small laugh ) Now you know why I livein a shoebox. I never thought finding a placewould be easy, I just... I thought I'd have some choices. You do have choices. Look, you could eithermove out of Manhattan, get some roommates,or get a realtor. Oh my god. Mindy, that's the womanI insulted the other day. What, are she and her posseback to beat me up or something? You don't know who that is? Taylor, are you kidding me? That is Kendall Rykerfrom My Children's Tomorrow. I love her! Is that, like, a TV show? Yes, it's a TV show! Seriously? Oh god. You got this. Welcome back. I will say I was surprised at how you handled thingslast time. I know, and trust me, I wasonly trying to help. You're so lovely and stately, I just wanted to findthe perfect dress for you. Well, sometimesthe truth hurts. I know, it does, but I'd alwaysrather know if I'm doingsomething wrong-- Oh, sweetie, no. I meant you telling methe truth. You're right. Sometimes I work againstmy height and not with it. Any-who, I was hoping thatyou could maybe help me pick out some nice clothes. Me and my friends? Yes, absolutely. Mindy, Courtney,want to give us a hand? Yes. I do, yep. By the way, I am adoring this. It's so... kicky yet savvy. Thank you. By the way, we love youon My Children's Tomorrow. Yeah. You're just, like,the best character ever. Oh, that's so sweet. Alright ladies,let's shop 'till we drop. Come with me. I have just the thing for you. I'm sorry. I can't breathe. Ok. That's the last one. Well, what do we have here? I was honest. I don't mean to be a stalker, but is there any way I could geta selfie with you? You certainly can, sure. Taylor, join us. Ready? Yes. Say "A-Line". ( together ) A-Line. Hi, I'm here to see Philip. Hey. Hey. Ready to find a great apartment? Absolutely. Just remember that I needto find the best place for the least amount of money. As opposed to the worst placefor the most amount of money? Because that I candefinitely do. You know what I mean. Trust me. You're in good hands. But remember, it's New York,so if you see a place you want you gotta grab it or a millionother people will. Survival of the fittest? Couldn't have said itbetter myself. So, shall we? Philip, you're kidding, right? I can't afford this. Maybe I could rent that cornerover there and set up a small tent. How much would that cost? Don't sell yourself short. Before you know ityou could own that shop and this place will be perfectfor you. That is your goal, isn't it? Well, maybe notthat shop, but... how did you know that? I know aspiration when I see it. Come on. I do want to own my ownstore eventually, but first things first. Keeping my job at A-Line. Something tells me whoeveryou're working for is lucky to have you. So do you aspire to ownBig Apple Realty? Well, my parentsown the place so I'd have to knockthem off first. Kidding! I love my parents. Alright, wise guy. Where next? Ok, where's this onthe aspiration scale? Starter. Aspirational. And the rent scale? For this? It says there's a view. Oh yeah, lovely. And still too expensive. You're gonna be fine,Ohio. I can tell these things. Someday soon you're gonnabe able to afford any one of those places. Until then I guess I'm stuckon Mindy's couch. Who knows? Some amazing,rent-controlled studio could show up onthe market tomorrow. Tomorrow? It's a figure of speech,but yes, soon. Why not? Look, do you want to sharea cab back downtown? Sure. Ok, go ahead. Me? Successfully hailing a cab inManhattan is a rite of passage. A rite I'm guessingyou haven't passed yet. It's a car. It has brakes. I'm a customer. How hard can it be? ( loud traffic noise ) Taxi! Taxi, ma'am? I'd be more impressed ifyou hailed me an apartment. Good one. Hey, I'm starving. Do you wanna grab someIndian food? Sure! What would you like? Mmm. You know, I don't know whatI'm eating but I like it. Chicken tikka, paneer masalaand pori bajji. Fried puffs of breadwith stewed curry potatoes. Best in all Manhattan. Spoken like a true native. You'll feel the samesoon yourself. I don't know. Back home I had everythingfigured out. This feels like a...I don't know, it's just a totallydifferent planet. If I moved to some small townin Ohio I would feel like it wasa different planet, too. So how's it workingfor your family? I grew up in it so it felt likethe thing to do. Don't get me wrong,I love real estate, but... I have other interests,too. Like? Like food. Food trucks. For lunch or for work? Maybe both. Food makes peopleso happy. It makes me happy. I don't know,it's a stupid idea. No it's not. What happened to if yousee something you want you gotta grab it? Nothing, I meant it if you wantto find an apartment, but... ( laughs ) Next time we'll do Cuban. There's a hot new truckmaking the rounds. Uh, next time? Phil, this is fun and...you're fun, it's- Next time we go lookingfor apartments. Yeah, I know. I meant, um... I just don't know if you'reworking in a higher bracket than I am. I- I don't want to wasteyour time. You're not wasting my time. At all. It's beautiful. Solids have their place, but they can also bea little predictable. Let's bring out yourunpredictable side. Most people don't think I havean unpredictable side. Especially my husband. That's where they're wrong,right? Let's try some patterns. Nothing too busy,just enough to say "don't second guess me". Ok, thanks. Ok, how did you do that? Do what? You just basically toldthe customer she was wrong. Yeah, and you said the customeris always right. They are. Until they're not. That's where we come in. You just have to pay attentionto who they are. What's best for them. Rather than, you know,what's best for you. Make sense? Ok, go try it. Come on, get out there. Ok... Let's go try. Right. Oh. Look at this guy. Relax. He's probably shoppingfor his wife. Or maybe he's lookingfor a new one. Hi. Hi. Are you lookingfor something special? Yeah, you know, a giftfor your wife or girlfriend? No, uh... I'm lookingfor Taylor Morgan. Does she work here? Oh. Taylor? Philip! Hey, what're you doing here? Uh, that sorta sounds like"good to see you". I'll take it. I'm sorry. Mindy, Courtney,this is Philip Bartell. Hi. Mindy. Courtney. I was just showing an apartmentin the area, I thought you might wannahop over for lunch. That Cuban truck I told youabout is parked over on 6th. I'm sorry, I can't. I have so much to do here- I would love to takea rain cheque. I mean, she would loveto take a rain cheque. Ok, sure. Another time. Sure. Anything new onthe apartment front? Uh, yeah. Lots. For $5,000 a month. But for you not so much. I'll keep you posted. ( whispering ) You look great today. Thank you. Where's Philip beenall my life? Ok, spill it. There's nothing to spill. He's just a guy helping mefind an apartment. Oh, ok. ( laughs ) You know how to dealwith the customers but you have no clueabout men. Yeah. Like he was justin the neighbourhood. Why not? He works all over the city. Oh, no. Even if I was interested in him,which I'm not, I- I don't have time for thatright now in my life. I need to focus on the store. Taylor, that boy is primeNew York real estate. No pun intended. That wasn't funny. You need to work this. Yeah, I mean, at leastjust be friends with him. You need friends. You have zero friends. The cat doesn't count. She's friends with a cat? Well, she made friendswith my cat. ( cat purring ) ( phone alert ) ( speaking Spanish ) This is the best Cuban sandwichI've ever had. The hype about that truckis all true. Full disclosure, I've never hadone of these. I mean, I've had like hamand cheese but this is amazing. Stick with me. ( laughs ) What? You've got this really sweetmustard mustache going on. Just... can I? So, a picnic, huh? Nice call. I think you picked the mostbeautiful spot in the city. I figured you could usesome downtime. Manhattan can get a littlehairy, even for us natives. Totally. This is just the perfect spotfor a relaxing lunch with a potential friend. Wow. Potential? ( laughs ) Not even full-fledged. That's... is that how you do itin Ohio? I don't know. I guess it's just how I'm doingit in New York. I like that, actually. You're carving your niche. Mid-west meets Manhattan. It's good. It makes you, you. It does, doesn't it? Here's my theory. It's great if people like you, but it's more importantthat they respect you. That they trust you. At least in business. Well, I like to be honestwith my customers but I also like to be protectiveof their feelings. I think people appreciate that. Don't you? Absolutely. I'm just saying it's ok to dowhat's good for you and the customer. Work againstbuyer's expectations. That sort of thing. I miss bicycling. Especially in the summer. Looks fun. Let's do it! Now? If you want something,grab it. Right? Come on. When you agreed to ridebikes I assumed you knew how! Well, people always sayit's as easy as riding a bike, I figured- Ok, well that only workswhen you know how in the first place! Oh my god. Just hold it straight. I'm trying. You're doing great! I think I'm gonna losethat Cubano sandwich! No, no, no, no!You got it! There you go. I'm gonna kill someone. You're a great teacher. Thanks for taking pityon a city kid. I guess growing up in suburbiahas its perks. Do you miss it? Ohio? A little. Yeah. Alright, maybe morethan a little. But not as much aswhen I got here. You gotta love progress,right? And when you have your own placeit'll be even better. What is it like to haveone's own place? Because two more weekswith Mindy and I might as well move in. Gotcha. Sorry, I'm on the lookout. Share a cab? Yeah, sure. Thought you'd never ask. Allow me. ( upbeat music ) ♪ Taxi! ( upbeat music ) ♪ Your chariot awaits, sir. Oh, thank you. ♪ Oh, wow. Everything ok? Um... we- we were just talking. And we wanna know howyou do it. Do what? Uh, come up with your outfits? I thought you hated my outfits. Well, Philip seems to like them. Yeah, and Kendall likes them,and she's famous. So we thought maybe we weremissing something. We hate missing something. Is this a joke? We don't joke about clothes. Or men. Ok. Why don't you stay after closing and I'll show you how it's done. Ok, great. Great. Oh, hey. Philip ask you out again? It wasn't a date the first time. We're just friends,remember? Uh, guys like that don't havegal pals. No. Well, he does now. Ok. Alright, get ready to lose thosefuneral clothes. Ok. It's just unsold merchandisefrom last season. It didn't sell then,it's not gonna sell now. But it might if we priceit right. We don't do discounts,remember? We do an annual, private,one-day invitation-only sale. Sometimes you have to workagainst buyer's expectations. That's a little too fortunecookie for me. Alyssa, the styleshaven't changed. Why not try selling amazingdesigner merchandise at more affordable prices? Attract folks who wouldnever set foot in here. Folks like who? Like... like me. That stuff is just sittingthere. Whatever we sellis a win-win. Taylor, well, I appreciateyour enthusiasm. That's not quite theground-breaking idea we need to producedouble digits. Sorry. What if it is? Alright, try it. But if it doesn't work I can't promise you I won't sayI told you so. Thank you. You're welcome. Have they been shoppingin your closet? Just... setting trendswherever I go. Just set sales trends,would you? The question is, though, how do I sell offthat old stock? It's not like there's any moneyfor advertising. Look, I know the clothes there are probably like ten timesmore expensive than the clothes here, but do you remember lastJuly when we did that- Summer sidewalk sale. Yes. That was so much fun! We sold everything! Pam, you're a genius. So why am I still in Ohio? Be careful what you wish for. Are you kidding me, pal? Back of the line. Taylor, what was that? Survival of the fittest. Oh. ( sale chatter ) That's so you right there! Ladies, don't forget, the newest merchandise is inside. The best of women's fashionsas always. You're gonna get this? Ok, perfect. This is insane. This one? It'll be perfect. I don't think we've ever workedthis hard. Not that I'm complaining. This pattern is so nice. Told you this would work. Alright, let me know if Ican help you with anything, ok? Ok, so the grand total for A-Line's summer sidewalksale is... That's double myone-day record. Which should increase thismonth's sales by... 6 percent. That's great, right? But not good enough. Double digits, remember? Besides, this sale was justa one-time thing. A one-off. What if the occasionalclassy discount became part ofA-Line's strategy? And part of yourexpansion strategy? Today was all potential. 6 percent this time could be26 percent next time. Put that in your business plan. Maybe I will. He's reaching out to otherrealtors for me, which is great. I'm wondering if I shouldn'tjust start looking on my own again. Take charge. Or you can move in herefor real. Really? Yeah. I mean, I know that this placeis super tiny and I'm not the best roommate,but you are, and look, Oscarseems to love you. You could just pay me whatever. You know, this is way betterthan anything else you're gonna find,trust me. Wow, so you're firing me? Well, I wouldn't say that. You still don't get myNew York sarcasm, do you? Anyway, Mindy is charging meso little to share that I really can't say no. At least not for now. So... will I ever see you again? New York sarcasm? New York dead serious. Do you want to see me again? I do. I'm really angling for this uh, full-fledged friend thingyou mentioned. Are you sure that's all,Philip? Because honestly it's allI'm in the market for right now, and you said it yourself. Your'e the "if you want it,grab it" guy, right? So- So maybe you just bringout the gentleman in me. So what're you doing Sunday? ( laughs ) This is so exciting. My first official New Yorksight-seeing tour. Come, we're just gettingstarted. That entrance is actuallythree stories tall. The frame is chadstone graniteand come on, are those not the coolestrevolving doors you've ever seen? The whole thing is just...it's incredible. Yeah, I know. There's only one thing missingif you ask me. What? Don't laugh, ok? I won't. What? You know the whole foodtruck fantasy I told you about? Yeah. I wanna do it onlyat city landmarks. Phil's Landmark Eats. Exactly. I like it. Why not, right? Just imagine it serving foodin the shadow of greatness. What kind of food? The five stars on Yelp kind? I don't know. Obviously. Why not, right? It's just a fantasy. Anyway, come on. We got lots more to see. Thank you. Best draught pour southof 14th Street. To your adopted city. Cheers, Taylor. Cheers. So, personal question. Ok. How come no guy in Ohioever snapped you up? For real? Uh, well, I was engaged once. Oh. More like engaged to be engaged,but my fiancé, Jack, decided to ask the girlhe'd been cheating on me with for three yearsto marry him instead. Woah. So, um... it's a realsweet story. So now I'm guessing yourSlimeball Radar is set to high. Well, ok. My turn. You got so excited talking aboutyour fantasy food truck. And food makes you so happy. Why wouldn't you try to makethat a reality? I have a career. I'm a realtor. And a realist. The job is good, the moneyis good, security... Maybe in another lifetime. You could start the process. See where it goes. And meanwhile,stick with real estate. You have to, becauseyou're going to eventually have to find me an apartment. What? Come to my place for dinnertomorrow night. I'll behave, I promise. ( laughs ) Are you cooking? Are you coming? Philip, your place is so you. Something smells really goodover there. Did you actually cook? Or did you just find the perfectscented candle? I'm a man of my word. Come on. Cheers. Cheers. Ok, if um... if doves fly outof this I'm... I'm gonna have to go. You've seen too manymagic shows. Go ahead. Lift it up. Me? Four way Cincinnati chili. I found a great recipe. That's real Ohio, right? Yeah. I'm from outside Columbus, but chili's a huge deal at homeand it's my favourite. I can't believe you made thisfor me. Thank you. And the piece de resistance,the Ohio state cookie. You made buckeyes? Have you been talkingto my mom? Not unless her nameis Rachel Ray. Dig in. Thank you. Mmm. Philip. This is... this is so good. It's perfect. Really? It's just like home. And I know my chili. This is what you should serveon your truck. And not your fantasy food truck,either. Your real one. I'll drink to that. Cheers!! Ok, so fess up. Where'd you learnto cook like that? When I was a kid my parentsweren't around much to cook. So I started messing aroundin the kitchen just to see what I couldcome up with. Turns out I wasn't half bad. And I got better as I got older. Maybe it is your life path. You know, I used to pick outclothes for all my friends in high school. They wouldn't set footin The Gap without me. Well, lucky them. And lucky me. Wow. Taylor? So what do you think? It's the future possible homeof Phil's Landmark Chili. What? You actually did it? Yeah, you inspired me. I did a bunch of researchand I think I can pull it off. I went online,looked at used food trucks, found this baby. So what do you think? I- I think I see you parkedin the shadow of the Chrysler Buildingselling chili to the masses and getting five-star reviewson Yelp! Yeah, I see a long roadto that. But... it feels like I startedthe journey away from my family businessand into something I love. You inspired me, coming all the way out hereto do what you love. I guess that sorta makes meyour role model. Yeah, it does. Adult drink to celebrate? Sure. Alright. They hated the idea? According to my mother I'mleaving a lucrative position to cook chili for secretariesand construction workers. That's a quote. I can't believethat's how she sees it. As opposed to my dad, who says I'm abandoninga three-generation legacy. Also a quote. If you don't wanna workfor the family business you shouldn't have to. That's what you'd tell me. Easier said than done. Look, all I'm saying is you need to takeyour own advice on this. You need to follow your heart. Well... what do you thinkI'm doing here with you? What? Philip, I like you. I really do. I'm just worried that, with work and everythingthat I have going on right now, that I don't have time for this. Taylor, what are youtalking about? We've barely started anything. So maybe before anyonegets disappointed we should hit pause whilewe're ahead, you know? While we're still friends. Disappointed? Is this about your fiancéor whatever he was? Because if it is I'm not him. I didn't say you were. And for the record I've hadplenty of people hurt me but it's only made me want tofind who I'm gonna be with more, not less. Because I know she exists. Define "plenty". What're you gonna do? I'm gonna perfectmy chili recipe. ( laughs ) ( traffic sounds ) Ugh. ( traffic sounds ) ( doorbell alert ) Miss Ryker, hi! How are you? I'm wonderful, Taylor. But I'm afraid, as muchas I love these dresses, a couple of them just aren'tworking with my wardrobe. I'm so sorry to hear that. Unfortunately we do havea seven day return policy. I know, but I've beenso busy with the show it's been virtually impossibleto get back in here. Where does the time go, right? Well, maybe we can breakthe rules. Just this once. Would you? Oh, that's so sweet. I appreciate that. I will make it up to you,I promise. No problem. Thank you. I'll be right back. You're not trying to return$3,000 worth of merchandise five weeks after the fact,are you? Uh... It's against our policyand it's bad for business. But it's goodcustomer relations. Especially when a customeris as well-known as she is. It's only a few dresses. And? I just told her I would do it. Ok, you can deduct it frommy paycheque if you need to. That'll work. ( message alert ) Hi. So sorry I'm late, I took thetrain in the wrong direction. Let me turn your day around. I've lived here forever. It's very special to me,so I have to be very careful who takes care of itwhen I'm living overseas. Of course. You seem like a lovely person. Oh, she's totally lovely,and super clean. And, like, obsessivelyresponsible. Trust me, she's your girl. Sounds like she's your girl. Mrs. Marks, you havea wonderful apartment. I would be honouredto live here. Thank you, dear. Well, um... I will thinkabout it and uh, I'll let your publicist know. ( small laugh ) Philip, I really love it. It's perfect, right? Now just sit tight. We'll hear soon. Any more discussionswith your parents? Yeah, yeah. This morningat the office. Did they calm down a bit? More or less. Look, I'm putting the brakeson the whole food thing for now. Yeah, I just... I moved too fast and just didn't think itthrough. Too fast for what? You were alreadyoff and running. They talked you out of it,didn't they? It's... it's complicated. Philip, think about this. I mean really, think about it. We could be talkingabout the rest of your life. I know. It's just not the right time. Look, I've gotta get backto the office. Do you want to meet uptomorrow night for drinks, maybe in Chelsea? We'll check out the Highline. You haven't been there yet,right? No, I haven't. Ok. Sure. Yeah? Alright. Bye. Anything work out? Alright, thank you. Hey, Taylor. Hi. I just got off the phonewith my investors who had a brainstorm. They wanna dropthe "A" in A-Line. Meaning what? Meaning they want to lowerquality to increase quantity for bigger returnsif they move forward. Which still remainsto be seen. What if I came up with somethinggame-changing? Something to get the investorsoff this "less is more" kick. We'll keep profitand quality alive. Like a Hail Mary passfor A-Line. I don't follow baseball. It's football, but... What do you have in mind? I don't know. I just thought of that. But I will come upwith something. Alright, well I am just gettingmore encouraged by the minute. Surprise me. But it better be good. So you brought it upwithout having an actual plan? I know, I just... I couldn'tstand how her investors were calling the shots. I just had to do something. Ok. So what's next? Hatch an idea to preservethe brand. I need to build on what'sworking and then come up with an even moreoriginal idea. Maybe in time forthe pre-fall launch. Well, if anyone can do it,it's you. You mean it? Of course. That's it. The pre-fall launch, but with new, neverbefore seen fashions. Where are you gonnaget those? I think I might havean idea. Just look at these lines. They're... I mean,they're amazing, aren't they? I don't know. It all feels just likea little bit dated. But it's timeless. It's classic. That's the point. The point is they were hiddenfor a reason. Look, I don't know anythingabout women's fashion but if you think they'respecial, go for it. Make them into actual clothes. Sell them in thatpre-fall launch. Right? Alyssa said to surprise her. Well, that would definitelysurprise her. I think they are incredible. Mindy and Courtneythink they're dated. Forget about them. If you think they're good,trust your instincts. Besides, price them high enough, they'll become must-haves. I know New Yorkers. Everything that's oldis new again. Exactly. I mean, you and Alyssacould even start your own exclusivefashion label. Cut out the middle man entirely. Those investors won't knowwhat hit them. Yeah. Right? Yeah, ok. I mean, it is startingto make sense... except for one minor detail. I have no idea how I'm actuallygoing to pay to have these clothes made. I think I might know the rightperson to make them for you. Actually he might even do itfor free if he likes them. This Alyssa S, she's got amarvelous eye for detail. And I should know. Believe me,I've seen them all. That reminds me, 1986. I was doing a Midsummer Night'sDream at Lincoln Centre, and there was this... yes, well you don't want to hearan old man like me babble on, do you? Rex, if you can honestlyget these done in a week you can talk all you want. Your wish is my command. Oh, that reminds me. Aladdin. I found myself sharing adressing room with the genie. Alright, careful. Y'all better not let me trip. ( laughs ) We'd never do thaton purpose. I can't believe I let youall talk me into this silliness. It will all be worth it,I promise. Ok, ready? Ok. Alright. One, two, three! What am I looking at? Really? These don't look familiar? They do, but that'dbe impossible. Maybe not. Where did you find these? They were stuffed in a drawerin the- in the back. I... as soon as I saw yourdesigns I knew this is it. This is the game-changerfor your investors. It could be a whole new startfor you. Alyssa's A-Line Originals. How dare you use my designswithout asking me first? Alyssa, you told meto surprise you. Surprise me? Yes. Betray me? No. B- betray you? ( stuttering ) How didI betray you? These designs weren'tany good. I wasn't any good. That's why I started sellingclothing in the first place. And I don't need youto remind me of my biggest mistake in life. God, Alyssa, you're...you are completely wrong. Look at your designs. They're incredible. They're timeless. Isn't that the exact wordI used? Timeless. Timeless. You two were in on this? Is it- I- the phone. Go get the phone. How did you pay for this? How did you get them made? It's a long story but... Alyssa, I'm so sorryif I overstepped. Honestly, I was just tryingto help. I can't believe that youwould show such a colossallack of judgement. I had bright plans foryour future at A-Line. But after this I don't knowwhy I brought you out here in the first place. You're right. I don't know whatyou ever saw in me. I don't belong here. And I never did. Goodbye Alyssa. Hey. How'd it go? Taylor? Taylor, what happened? She hated it. Hates the designs,hates me. I quit before she couldfire me. You did what? Why did you encourage me? Don't lay this on me. If- if Alyssa got mad,why didn't you fight back? Fight for what you believe in? Where's your aspiration? Where's your aspiration? At the realty officewith mom and dad? You're a hypocrite. And you've gone from beinga sweet and trusting girl to being a big New York cynic. Taxi! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Well. Is she coming back? I didn't even knowthat she was leaving. Can I be the newstore manager? So that's a no? I just wanted to dosomething real. Something authentic. Make a difference. Yeah, but Taylor,you're forgetting something. Ever since we were kids youwanted to live in New York. Conquer the fashion world,right? So what? So, if you really wantto be authentic you need to head backto Manhattan. I can't go back there. Alyssa does notwant me there. You should haveseen her face. It's a big city. There are other jobsin the clothing business. Ones I can mess up justas badly. No. I just wanna stayat my parent's house and sleep in my childhood bedwhere anything was possible. Ok. Well, I think you should letsomeone in New York know where you are. Oh gosh. So are you two gonna stand therelike a pair of mannequins or are you gonnahelp me out? What's the point if you'renot gonna promote Mindy or me? The point is soyou'll keep your job. Is that so complicated? ( sighs ) Alright, fine. Thank you. Great. ( doorbell alert ) ( laughing ) Hello, Mrs. Ryker. Welcome back. Can we help you find something? I am looking for Taylor. She did such a huge favourfor me last time I want to make it up to her witha little... you know what? Make that a largeshopping spree. No returns this time. ( laughing ) Um, Taylor's not in but Mindyor Courtney can assist you. Oh. Um, that's ok. You know what? I'll just... I'll just waitfor Taylor. Oh. Ooh, are these new? Stunning. I love the lines and the detail. Wow. Who's the designer? Wait, let me guess. Let me guess. Escada? Well, um... Ok. Thank you. Hey there! Hey. I heard about a sale,thought I'd check it out. That's a relief. For a second I thoughtyou were here to see me. Nothing wrong with a littlemulti-tasking. Buy you a cup of coffee? Sure. I mean, I just figuredafter what happened I would have fired me. I freaked out. I completely overreacted. And you weren't fired,you quit. I was mortified. I let you down. Taylor, I want to tell youa story. Ever since I learned to drawI wanted to design clothes. And I was well on my wayuntil someone close to me told me that I wasn't any good,wasn't special. Derivative, as a matter of fact. They were totally wrong. They, no. He had way too much influence over a young,impressionable woman. But love will do that to you. So I shifted gearsand went into retail. And I made a vow that I wouldnever let anyone or anything stand in my way again. You can still design,you know. You know who also thinks so? Kendall Ryker. Big fan of yours. Wait, really? Yeah. She came into the store, she saw my designs andshe now wants to finance them and promote them. So I told my investorsand they were intrigued. Wow. I guess my instinctsweren't so bad after all. That's why I need you backin New York. To help me figure outhow to work my designs into the A-Line chain, which my investorsare ready to finance. Oh, I completely forgot. Fiscal year ended yesterday. Does that mean we madedouble digits after all? Barely. Kendall's shopping spreeput us over the top, so... thanks, partner. Partner? Like, a real partner? It's what I needed all along, I just didn't know ituntil you left. It's yours if you want it. ( stuttering ) Idon't know what to say. Oh, come on. Please don't tell me I flewall the way to Ohio for nothing. You could have just texted. Now you tell me. ( laughs ) ( upbeat music ) ♪ ♪ I love my city ♪ ♪ I love my city. ♪ ...our new location, ok? Thank you. Taylor! Not a minute too soon. Grab a customerand start selling. Alyssa, what's going on? Why are we liquidating? Well, now the investorsfeel the only way they'll approve the expansionis if we close this location. They feel it's too big,too expensive and in the wrong area. Close the store? How could you give upwhat's been your home, your identity,for over 20 years? You gave up your home to moveto New York, right? We do what we have to do. Taylor! Taylor, hi! Oh, Oscar's gonna beso excited to see you. How was Nebraska? Was it terrible? Welcome back, Taylor! We'll talk later, I gottamove merchandise. The girls. Some things never change,right? Yeah, except apparentlyA-Line. Come with me. I want to show you something. This is your plan, Alyssa? Turn A-Line into The Gap? It's not The Gap, Taylor. No, The Gap is Bergdorf'scompared to what's in here. No wonder they think this isthe wrong location. Why are you acting so surprised? I told you this massmarket approach was being floatedweeks ago. That was before we launchedAlyssa's A-Line Originals. You know, elegant, expensive? How are you gonna sellthose in some junk shop? I won't. I can create a budget line. It's just a product. I can still make it special,make it mine. This is all about money,isn't it? I make nowhere nearwhat I used to. I'm just trying to evolveand so should you. You aren't evolving. You're devolving. You're not looking atthe big picture here. I thought I wasyour partner. Then act like one. Come up with one of your... hell, whatever ideas. Prove me wrong. Or better yet, why don'tyou prove that you're right? But know this, Taylor. I'm signing tomorrow,with or without you. Hi, can I have one orderof chicken tikka masala? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Here you go. Thank you. Taylor! Philip! What're you doing here? Sorry, that's- that's astupid question. Are you back? I mean, I can see you're back,but, for good? Why didn't you answermy text messages? I had to find out nothingabout you from Mindy. I'm sorry about what I saidlast time. You're not a cynic. You're smart and beautiful,talented and super capable. And a good friend. Thanks. I'm not sure aboutthe last part, but... Maybe second time'sthe charm. Philip, right now I really dohave to focus on me and my career. I can only be friendsright now. You know, you and I? It's just not the right time. I'm sorry. Take care, ok? What Alyssa's doing feels likea huge professional step down with no guarantee of success. I didn't move to New Yorkto sell cheap clothes. It just feels wrong. Ok, so what would need to happenfor it to feel right? Keep the store as is and make and market Alyssa'soriginal designs. You need to tell her this. Not me. And then I think,do I even want someone like Alyssaas a partner? Look, I know that shecan be a diva and she's definitely made mecry on more than one occasion. But look, under all of that... Alyssaness, she's gota really good heart. When I first startedworking at A-Line I had a lot ofcredit card debt. Alyssa paid all of itoff for me, and I paid her backso I didn't have to deal with all those interest rates. Wow. That is so nice. It's almost as nice as flyingout a girl from Ohio to run your storeafter knowing her for, what, five minutes? Listen, all I'm saying isshe's taking a chance on you. Why don't you takea chance on her? Ok, gentlemen. So I just signwhere all the tabs are? Taylor. What do you know? These are my investors. I was just about to sign. Are you in or are you out? Could you excuse usfor a moment? Taylor? Alyssa, please read this. I know what I said yesterdayabout options, but it's too late. I need to take this deal. You hired me for my honesty,so here it is. I think you got nervous andyou caved to outside pressure. I think you lost sight of whatyou really love about clothes. Which was what? How the perfect outfit can tellyour own personal story. How you see yourself. How other people see you. What sets you apart. Why else would you designyour own line? To be unique. Go on. My plan retains A-Line'soriginal vibe but expands it to widenthe buyer base. We'll blend new, classic,vintage, quality fashions. And it creates a flagship home for Alyssa's A-LineOriginals right here. One store, no expansion. What's A-Line Online? Amazingly, somethingyou've never had before. It's a digital way to open upthe brand, and now your designs, to the world outsideof Manhattan. L.A. Tokyo. London. Even little old Ohio. It's an interactive websitefor women to forge their own signature style usingvirtual reality to combine older looks from theirclosets that they love with newer A-Line fashions. Alyssa, the bottom line isyou can have your own store and create your own line andbe hugely successful at both, and stay true to yourself. You can have it all. Excuse me. Gentlemen, I decided that I'mgoing to pass on your offer. Ok then. What was that? I just told my investorsthat I'm out. I'm returning to my rootsand following your plan. But here, and here only. Alyssa, that's incredible! I need a full-time commitmentfrom you. To A-Line and to New York. No turning back. No turning back. Partners. Partners. ( laugh ) Taylor? You can have it all, too. How do you mean? I believe his name is Philip? ( laughs ) I have spies everywhere. We were just... well, I don't knowexactly what we were. Whatever it was,it's over now. I have more work to do herethan ever. I can't think about dating. It is great to loveyour work. But not at the expenseof your love life. You are an original, Taylor. Don't be a cliche. Go on out there andshare your victory. Go. Thank you. No, thank you. Bye, girls. Bye. ( upbeat music )♪ Taylor, right? Hi, I'm looking for Philip? He's actually not in today,but can I give him a message? No, that- that's ok. Thank you. Philip, hi. Your friend Taylor camearound looking for you. Sure. You're welcome. Hey, lady! You need a lift, ma'am? It's pretty tough to geta cab in this town. Come on. Hop in. Philip, is this whatI think it is. You're really doing it. Phil's Landmark Chili. Yeah, it probably makesno sense and my parents probably won'ttalk to me for... well, ever. But this is what I wanna do. I'm so happy for you. I'll be your best customer. Does that mean you're stickingaround for good? I came up with a whole new planfor A-Line and Alyssa went for it! No investors, no expansion,just us. You're looking ather new partner. Partner? I know. Wow! Congratulations. That's awesome. Well, I've got a surprisefor you. Your realtor never stoppedworking for you. Mrs. Marks' apartment? It's yours if you want it. How'd you do it?! You did it. She liked you. Thought you'd take good careof the place. ( stutters ) I don't knowwhat to say. Thank you. I- I couldn't have done itwithout you. I couldn't have done thiswithout you, so thank you back. What's next? I gotta get a permit. Get a food license. Create a menu,overhaul a truck... No, I meant what's nextfor us?
