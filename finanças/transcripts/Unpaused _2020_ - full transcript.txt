Finally! Who wears red these days? Is she trying to start a revolution or something? Are you okay? Blink twice if you can hear me. Who comes and sits right next to you on the first date? Is there a problem? No, why? Are you always like this? Or did you smoke something special today? You can tell me, I am not going to judge you. She is just like that girl. Number 67. Loony, bossy, crazy. Oh God, this is going to be a long date! Checking the time already? This menu is shirt. I mean, shit! No one orders food here anyway. Well, I am going to order! What are you looking at? I spelt good money on this. I mean, spent. Typical middle-class mentality, underneath the designer wear. So charming... Has anyone told you about your smile? It lights up your eyes. How long does it take for someone... to fall in love at first sight? Ahan! Will you actually speak out loud, or just going to talk to yourself? L-O-L. L-O-L? Sheesh. So, what happens after the first date? Do people meet outside as well? Have you ever met anyone outside-- Look ma'am, I want to make one thing clear so that there's no confusion or any false expectations later. I don't meet anyone outside. This is the only place where I meet others. You are highly delusional, you know that? You think I want to meet "You" outside? I just wanted to know how the system works! -Sorry, ma'am. -What's with the "ma'am"? My name is-- Wait a min... You've forgotten my name, right? Is this a date or a bloody interrogation? How many dates have you come here on? 193 times. So, I am number 194 for you! 193. It's 193 including you. Okay, that's it! I'm out of here. I need a replacement! No, no! Please don't go! We've paid for an hour here. If you leave, we'll lose the money. This place has strict "no replacement" policy. Fine, now you talk. How come you're wearing red? So? Don't you think it's negative color... red? I mean, blood... war, stop signals, hazmat suits, contamination zone-- Roses. The color red has received some terrible PR! Do you remember Valentine's Day? Has been banned for 10 years now. Sure. But, even if it was a marketing gimmick... at least we got a chance to express our feelings to each other. Red, Valentine's day, roses, dates... Who talks like that, in these times? Isn't she scared? How can she be so brave and stupid... and beautiful! My brother, Nikhil, always tells me... for someone with an IQ of 164... and I'm not trying to brag here... but I'm a bit stupid when it comes to romance. The reason I want the vaccine to work... is I want romance back in my life. What I'm about to tell you... is strictly confidential! The human trials that we are conducting with the new vaccine-- Fuck! You're a warrior! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I almost dated death! Ahan, statistically speaking... no one has ever been infected by virtual contact. Shut up, Mala! I know that. Do you really mean it? Do you want me to shut down? No, no, please don't shut down. Given my bio-data, my psych profile, and 11 months of dating history... how could the app set me up with a warrior? There’s a bloody glitch in the system! There can never be a glitch in the system. Covid-19... Covid-22... Covid-26... And now, Covid-30. Viruses are the new terrorists! Mean little bastards. Before Covid, I was just a software engineer. Now, I'm a Reiki master, a civil lawyer... Sanskrit expert... and a lot many other things. 6 million people have died in the last 12 years. But, I'm still alive. Call me a "hypo"! So what? I know it's an unpopular opinion, but heroes die... and survivors live to tell the tale. My latest achievement. I've grown a hybrid eggplant which has 30% more magnesium than a normal eggplant. Patent pending! #vocalforlocal Skipping... My mental workout. My emotional spa. Not just WFH, I do EFH. I do "Everything From Home." If you really want to, you can live your entire life at home. Without ever having to step outside! But there's a side-effect to it. Loneliness. The human trials for the vaccine will commence soon. Will we be able defeat Covid-30 this time? Mala, change the channel. Changing. There's sad news coming from across the world. -Change the channel. -Changing. When kids blinded by love, elope from their homes... in spite of knowing that they will be quarantined for life if they are caught-- Mala, turn off the TV. What idiots! This is all so depressing. As per the current census... 87% Indians agree with you. Would you like to know another trivia about-- Mala, please turn off your trivia setting. Mala... I behaved pretty badly towards her, right? As per Indian tradition, women do not address their husbands by their names. Which is why, they... use different indirect pronouns... -to address them. -You're so funny, Mala! Who are you referring to? I'm talking about number 193. Number 193. Female. -Her name-- -I know, Ayesha Hussain! -I know. -I am impressed! The last thing I want is a bloody warrior in my life. Fuck! You're a warrior! Fuck you! "Warriors." Virus Warriors! The super heroes of our universe don't wear capes. They wear PPE suits. On the second Sunday of every month people bang vessels light lamps to thank us. There are songs dedicated to us! They have even made 4 series and 12 films about us, so far. We are "Warriors!" Warrior! Do you know what is the biggest tragedy of a Warrior? We are only meant to be in conflict zones. But not near your homes, or in your neighbourhoods or even at the shopping malls. You need us, but you don't want us! We are the new untouchables! But I am not going to leave my house. I'm not going to move out! Boo! And hypos are the worst! Screw you all! Mala, I can't taste anything. Covid symptom number 4. Loss of taste. Oh, shit! I didn't sanitize the ukulele certificate properly. I'm going to die now because I mastered the art of playing the ukulele. Mala, call Cama Clinic. Ahan, you're a registered hypo. Without a family member or a guardian, they won't entertain your call. Call my sister! Jhanvi is not going to answer your call. How could you make Sia cry on her birthday? What is so wrong that I said? You’ve given her a book about sleeping beauty. A tale in which a random guy kisses a random girl without testing for antibodies or knowing each other's medical history. This is just bad parenting! Ahan, fuck you! It's the first choice for people to ease any pain. Madhur Raag Charukeshi. Congratulations! Your taste buds are fine. Fuzz off, Mala! Ahan! Mind your language. Abuses come from the dirty pit of the mind. But remember, there's still a 30% probability of you testing positive for Covid. Mala. Do you think Ayesha will ever talk to me? The probability that Ayesha will talk to you again is 13%. But, 13 is an unlucky number! Ahan, my trivia settings are off. Please switch off your sarcasm settings too! Ahan, these are my factory settings. Just get me Ayesha Hussain's number, okay? What are the odds that the bloody app would pair me up with a hypo? What are the chances that after ghosting me that hypo creep would dare to call me again? Hi, sorry. I know, it's bad manners to disappear right in the middle of a date. I panicked. I was stressed that day and overreacted. I know your type very well! You hypos think only about yourselves. Selfish. Cowards. You live your whole life holed up like rats! Now I get it. This is why the other day "spent" auto-corrected to "spelt" because you were typing. That's why lol and all. For a second, I thought you were some bot. By the way, I'm really sorry to know that-- Oh, please! Shove your sorry! Just imagine how unhygienic prison is especially for a hypo. You'll go mad there! If you dare call me again, I'll get you thrown in prison. Mala, what did she say? For me to understand this... I'll have to download the sign language package. Would you like me to download and auto debit your credit card? Data analysis. She has stored you as Ahan Creep in her phone. Creep. Could either be a verb or a noun. Are you screwing with me or something? Do you even have a data analysis package? It keeps anger and stress levels in check. Raag Malhar. It has taken 12 years, 180 vaccines and scientists from 21 countries. Hope these human trials work. The world is watching us with great expectation. Fuck off! Or I'll call the police! JUST SMELL WHAT I'M SAYING ONCE. AFTER WHICH I'LL PLAY RED LIGHT UNIFORM. ARE YOU LEARNING SIGN LANGUAGE? AND A FORK WILL TRUST ITS SKILLS. CUSTARD MATTERS THE MOST. -A SHOES AND ITS LACE NEED EACH OTHER. -YOU'RE MAD. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? BUT YOUR SIGN LANGUAGE IS GOOD. Hi. YOU MUST THINK I'M A GLUE STICK. What does one call a "clingy person"? IF WE DO EACH OTHER AGAIN, IT WILL BE A NICE OMLETTE. It's weird... but I love being serenaded by someone in gibberish. It's the 7th of February. Trivia! Rose Day is celebrated a week before Valentine's Day. I'm so glad that I didn't turn off Mala's trivia settings because now I get to surprise Ayesha. But she never came. A sad news coming from across the world. In the war between Man versus Microbes we have lost again. The vaccine human trials that we were working on for the last 18 months failed. For more updates, stay tuned! They say bad news never comes alone... The black envelope. In warriorspeak, it's called the dreaded envelope. Everyone fears it, and hope that day never comes. Queen to G1. Mala, call Ayesha. Ayesha isn't answering your call. Rook to G1. Knight to F2. Check mate! Would you like to play Ludo? I learnt a new language for Ayesha. And she didn't even feel the need to tell me why she doesn't want to talk to me. There can be multiple reasons for this. A - Ayesha has lost her phone. B - Ayesha doesn't like you anymore. C - Ayesha is dead. Warriors have a high rate of suicide due to depression, anxiety and alienation. As per probability, option C tops the list. There's a brilliant documentary on the rising suicide rates amongst Warriors. Should I put that on your viewing list? Uncle, there's a hole in your suit! Fuck off! Brother, how much more time? Just a couple of minutes, sir. Please! Please! It's me. Ahan! Sorry! I've become a little paranoid these days. The people here don't like me much. May I come in? I told you about Nikhil, my brother. He passed away last week. Is that why you were not answering my calls? Nikhil was the only one I had in this whole world. The human trials have failed and we don't know if and when we'll succeed. Through all this... I have been all alone. Ayesha, you are not alone. I am here for you. How? How, Ahan? From all the way there? How are you there for me, Ahan? At the VR cafe or on video calls. If we get to know each other well we'll move to the virtual sex rooms? If you miss me terribly... you'll come all the way to meet me wearing a hazmat suit? You're a Hypo! And, I am a Warrior! How? How is any of this real? This relationship, this fake... pretend intimacy in our relationship is not happening! Please, go! Please, Ahan! Leave me alone. Surely, it was a glitch in the system that made us meet. For people like us there's no such thing as "Happily ever after"! I'm a coward. Green grass also gives me panic attacks. No, no. I mean the outside world. Do you know what it takes for me to leave home and come here? My initial instinct is to protect myself. And yet... I've come here... because... I wanted to see you... and be with you. Sorry, I... stepped out of the house after a long time so... it's all sticky. My hands are sweaty! It's okay, I won't touch my face. Don't worry! I have 2 Covid test kits, just in case. How long does it take to fall in love at first sight? About the same time it takes to catch a virus! Mala, it's Valentine's Day, right? Yes, Ahan. So, what's the safest way for 2 people to... you know... Welcome back. The PM yesterday appealed to the nation to adhere strictly to the Janta Curfew that will be put into effect tomorrow, Sunday, 22nd March from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. As the world goes into lockdown and different countries are adopting strict measures, and the question being asked is, how India is going to be dealing with the spread amongst its vast population especially in the slums and communities of the over populated cities especially when... Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! You're at home? I thought the door is locked. I went down to ask the guard. Who are you? Your window... The water from your plants is leaking into my house. I think your flower pot has cracked. It could be broken as well. I'll have it taken care of. No, it'll be great if you can take care of it. -Thank you. -I am right under you. Excuse me? I mean, sorry. I stay in the flat right below yours, 901. 901? That's Mr. Kapoor, I think. I moved in just yesterday. The curfew began as soon as I moved in. -Okay. -That's alright. I'll get it done. Thank you. Ma'am, can I get some water? Cold water? Actually, I don't have access to cold water. My refrigerator didn't make the shift. I had a bad break up with my girlfriend. She decided to keep the fridge. So... Yeah, one second. Thank you so much. Just... one more sip. You can keep it. It's okay. I'm done. Last sip. Please. This will do. Thank you so much. I have just another small request. Sorry, one minute. -Do you have tea leaves and milk? -What? I didn't get any groceries and I need tea first thing in the morning. I used to have coffee when I was with my girlfriend. She used to only have coffee. She had a lot of tantrums. She would have six cups of coffee in a day and then complain about stomachaches. I would tell her that one is bound to have a stomachache after six cups of coffee. Thank you so much. By the way, I am Chirag. That's great. Should I help you move the pots? They seem to be very large. No, like I said, I'll get it done. How will you manage all by yourself? I'll help you. There's no shame in asking for help. Who said anything about shame, man? I am sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. No, it's okay. I'll get it done. It's fine. Thanks. I'm sorry. Okay. Bye. I have with me Sahil Khanna, award winning journalist and editor of the controversial online magazine True Page. Shripath, you have to understand that no country globally has any clue how to deal with this new, novel Corona virus. -You need help? -Yeah, sure. Come on. Devika, we can sort this out. What can we sort out? This. What? Whatever is happening. What's happening, Sahil? Devika, please. Hey! You didn't hesitate while doing it, but now you are hesitant to even say it? What can we handle, Sahil? Fuck it! I don't want to talk to about it. Fine, let me talk about it. Five women at True Page have accused you of sexual misconduct. You would call them into your cabin in the middle of our office and ask them, to either pull their skirts up or pants down or else... Or else they wouldn't get a byline. It's a fucking lie. All of them are lying? All of them? Please, Sahil! Don't insult my intelligence like this. Please. Devika, listen to me. Please don't touch me. Please, just stay the fuck away. Please. What are you doing? Are you crazy or what? Are you crazy? Trisha and Shraddha, they are 15 years younger than you. Their eyes would light up when you walked into a room. Sahil Khanna doesn't just give us the news, he gives us the truth. Sahil Khanna! -How could you do this to them? -I haven't done it! Sahil, just stop trying to deny it. Please. HR has called me. When did you become this monster? What are you doing, pretending to be this doting husband at home and you were whipping your dick out at any girl who wanted to work at my magazine. Devika. Please explain to me. How could I not see it? How could I not see it, Sahil? Ask yourself that. You could have stopped me. Why didn't you? What? I think you should leave, before I do something we'll both regret. Yeah? Now. Ask yourself that. You could have stopped me. Why didn't you? Last night my panelist Sahil Khanna, the editor of online magazine True Page made some very hard predictions. No, no, I am not saying... I am not pointing fingers at your government. No government has made any investments. Yes. No, no, we cannot allow the virus to enter the community stage, otherwise, there will be utter chaos. Why do you keep buying this chocolate? You know I love it. But you never eat it. It takes a lot of effort to not eat this. Your willpower does look a little weak this evening. Meaning? I mean, don't you think you were having a very cozy conversation with Mittal? Oh, please. He's interested in the magazine, not me. We were talking shop. He wants to buy True Page. With or without you? Obviously with. What does that look mean? It's a line, my love. A pick up line. But Mittal was... you know. You would know. Excuse me? What do you mean? Hon, don't you think Trisha is too wet behind the ears, to cover the verdict of such a big case? Wow. Surprising. I thought you'd be happy, considering what your dad had told you when you decided to open this magazine. I am happy. Babe, you showed initiative. You proved him wrong. That's how you are able to tell Mittal to fuck off today, and have this $100 chocolate. Right? Go Corona, go. Go Corona, go. Go Corona, go. Go Corona. You enabled him, Devika. You were his primary... You could have stopped me. Legally, the girls have a solid case. Why didn't you stop me? Have some shame, Devika. We suffer because of disgusting wives like you. Why didn't you stop me? Please, never ever make tall claims, that you fought hard to build this business. HR just called. Both have filed a complaint, Sahil. Madam, the building secretary asked me to check up on you. Everyone is worried. You haven't been taking anyone's calls since two days. Your intercom isn't working? He has asked you to call sir. Which sir? Your husband. Sahil sir. Okay, then... Listen. Yes? Are we done banging plates for today? We aren't supposed to do it every day. It was done day before yesterday. With God's grace, everything will soon be fine. Okay, then... Bye. -Listen. -Yes? Is the grocery store open? I needed some coffee and a packet of cigarettes. I'll check. Thank you. Hey, hi. -Just... just give me two seconds. -Hi. I'll just connect my headphones. It will just be simpler to... Hi. Hi, hi. Can you hear me? Yes. Super. Thanks for dialing in. How are you holding up? Okay. So, as your company lawyer, let's go through the-- What the fuck, Pragya! You can't con me into talking to this. Please. Devika, just let's, let's... What are you doing, Devika? What are you doing? The world is coming to a fucking end because of this pandemic. Every day, every hour there is a breaking story. People are waiting for us for minute by minute updates and I'm holding this ship together from fucking Alibaug. Wow! The great Sahil Khanna is still saving the world. How do you manage it? How are you managing to work without the cursory blowjob? Or have you made local arrangements also? Right, Sahil? -Look what she's saying-- -Please calm-- Sir used to keep calling me into his cabin quite a few times in a day. He would make me rewrite the story again and again... until what I want to say... is crystal clear. I've learnt a lot from him. Then one day he called me in. It was a very big story. He wanted to send me to do it. I was shocked. I thought he would go himself to cover it. And then just as casually as he'd ask me to add a comma or a full stop, he said... he said, let me fuck you. He said, let me fuck you... and you can do the story. When I started to leave, he said he won't call me in again. We don't need to go anywhere. Whatever we do, we'll do right here. It won't take time. Then I... You could have stopped me. Why didn't you? Mrs. Khanna! Mrs. Khanna! Please open the door! Mrs. Khanna! Oh, God! The pots, right? I'll move them. Right. You still haven't moved them. Why? What do you mean? Are they heavy? Obviously they are. I'll move them, okay? -Let me help you if it's okay with you. -No, please stay here. I'll do it. Please. You didn't let me finish. Like I said, let me help you. -It won't take long. Let's go. -No, please! How dare you! Excuse me! Oh, sorry. -Can I come in? -No. Then how will I help you? Did I ask you to help me? I don't want your help. Everyone needs help, ma'am. Even when people don't ask for it. I have a simple rule. No matter what the problem is, it's always up to us to choose, whether we go with the problem or with the solution. You tell me. Meaning? I mean, we will of course go with the solution. Won't we, ma'am?" After all, we are educated, intelligent and responsible people. You in fact are beautiful and rich as well. What does this have to do with the pots? Solution. Let me help you move the pots. It will solve the problem. It won't take long. It'd be better if you stayed out. I'll move the pots, okay? -Okay. Great. -Yeah. I am so sorry, for disturbing you this early in the morning. It's okay. You look the type who is into yoga and meditation. I, too, have joined online yoga classes. Earlier I used to watch it on television and do it, but now I've started taking proper online classes. These asanas are beyond me. Can't understand whether I'm doing yoga or circus tricks. My instructor keeps making me do such weird poses. Doing yoga in the mornings has become so stressful. This yoga is a scam, I tell you. I swear. Oh sorry, I am blabbering. Actually, I feel a little excitedly nervous when I see you. Everyone knows you. I have a True Page subscription. My girlfriend had subscribed initially, but then I got it as well. When I came here to complain the first time around, I had no idea that I'd encounter a big man. I mean like a big woman. Like... Oh, I am sorry. Like, like hugely, like famous, like big, like... Okay. Oh, sorry. I need to... Sorry. Sorry. I need to... With time, you will perfect the asanas. It took me a lot of time as well, even though I look the yoga and meditation type. I'll get it done. I'll move the pots. -Wonderful. -Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Have a nice day. Ask the guy at 901 what leakage is he talking about? There is no leakage from my apartment. 901? Madam, 901 is empty since two years. No one stays there. I have the keys. Mr. Kapoor, who's in London has instructed me to clean up the place every other week or so. Secretary's flat number? -Ma'am, please don't tell him. -I don't want to hear any excuses. No, tell me the secretary's flat number right now. Do you have any idea what he was doing? -You stay away. -Madam... You fucking pervert. I saw you. -Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry. -You... he was watching me. -It's not what it looks like, ma'am. -Call the police. -It's not what it looks like. -Will you please shut up? Call the police. Who are you listening to? Just calm down, ma'am. Calm down, ma'am. Please don't... Fine, if you want to call the police, then go ahead. -Call them. -Please call them. Please call the police! If you want to call the police then go ahead. When they ask me why I kept going to your house, I'll tell them the truth. Then they will question you, not me. I perhaps don't understand your problem, but I do understand... what you were about to do. There's someone I knew who... I knew that person had a problem but I never tried to understand it. This doesn't solve anything, Mrs. Khanna. It doesn't end anything. This plan is very wrong. It's a good thing, someone came to stop you. It's not important who stopped you. What's important is that you stopped. I too wanted to call the police but... if I had waited for them to come then perhaps... you would've done something. Maybe someone has given you a lot of pain. Someone has hurt you a lot. But you can't give up that easily, Mrs. Khanna. Believe me, I know. Because if you didn't, you wouldn't have opened the door. Didn't you open the door both the times when I rang the bell? That means you aren't completely ready to give up. You can still fight it out, Mrs. Khanna. Just be brave one more time. I, too, am trying. I am going to ace Vrikshasana, the tree pose, even if I end up breaking a bone or two. I will stick this foot right here come what may, wait and watch. Almost. You can do it, Mrs. Khanna. You can do it. Didn't you open the door both the times when I rang the bell? That means you aren't completely ready to give up. You can still fight it out, Mrs. Khanna. Just be brave one more time. You can do it, Mrs. Khanna. I know what we have to do next. We need to find a way to end this. We have already initiated informal talks with all of the girls. We're thinking if-- Let the girls go public with their accusations. And tell them they will have my full support. Devika, this will take us all down, dammit. Listen Devika, we can't do that, okay? That's... that's not a practical solution. What was that you said to me? That I could have stopped you. Right? Better late than never, Sahil. Now, I will stop you. -Devika, just please... -Devika, are you crazy or what? -Fuck! -This is not a fucking couple's fight. We are running a company here. Devika! I know that time isn't On my side these days This journey called life is A bit tough these days It's like the world Has come to a standstill But this dark night too shall pass, You'll see A new dawn awaits at your window, Let it in This darkness won't do you any good Let it out A new dawn awaits at your window, Let it in This darkness won't do you any good Let it out Go Corona! Go! Go! Go! He who is protected by God... cannot be harmed! Go Corona! Go! Go Corona! Go! Get me some tea. I'm fed up with this woman. Madam, is he wearing a mask? Do you expect me to wear a mask inside my own house? Not you, madam. Is he wearing one? -Yes, he is. -She's giving me a headache! But how is that even relevant? My complaint is very simple. -He's making a racket... -Answer the damn phone, Kadam! -and I'm getting disturbed. -Madam, I can't hear you. -I'm a senior citizen and... -Madam... Is he with a lot of people? No, it's just him... -but he's got a loudspeaker of a voice! -I can't hear you. Speak louder! -Wait a minute. Listen to this. -Hello! Hello! -Just one minute. I'm going out. -Hello! Hello! -I can't hear you. -Hold on. Please hold on. -Hello, I can't hear you. -One minute. Shut up! I can't hear her. -Hello! Hello! -Just a minute. Hello! -Can you hear him now? -I can't understand what you're saying! Kadam, lock this bugger up! One minute. -Hello! Madam... -One minute. -Can you hear him now? -Hello! Hello! Madam, where is the noise? The news at primetime is more noisy. -Madam... -I've been trying for so long but... -you refuse to understand my complaint! -We are on Covid duty. -He's loud and breaking curfew! -Complaining to us is a waste of time. Will you only show up once I die of a heart attack and become a headline? "Body of a 65-year-old woman found by the milkman!" Hello? -It's 5 in the evening, madam. -Hello! -Hello! -How is he breaking curfew? Aren't you aware of the timings? Sawant, why is my tea not here yet? As if Covid duty is not stressful enough... I now have to listen to this rubbish! Don't waste our time with such useless complaints. We're on Covid duty, madam. Useless? This is your fifth complaint... against your own neighbors this month. I'm fed up of Covid and now this-- Corona virus still continues to challenge the doctors... at this country's top infectious diseases hospital. The hospital reached its maximum capacity in just a few days and is-- The Health minister has come out and spoken about how India is... tackling with the number of hospital beds being available and... the oxygen supply at all Covid centers. He has assured the public that adequate numbers of oxygen cylinders are available for Government to run Covid centers. There is a new extension to the lockdown till the 20th of May. Red zone, orange zone and green zones have been identified and various guidelines will be applied to each zone. As per the directions received by the Chairman of Railways... in order to help the migrant workers... reach their villages safely and without any trouble. Quest for the Covid 19 vaccine and the directive to the Institute of Prevention has been to start clinical trials in the country mirroring the advancement that is taking place in the United Kingdom and other countries... that are working hard to issue the vaccine by the end of 2020. And Dr. Malik, his colleague who will together help us... understand the virus and it's spread a little better while busting the myths around it. Welcome to the show. Why are you ringing my doorbell in a lockdown? -Hello, aunty. I... -Not aunty. It's Archana ma'am for you. Archana ma'am, I'm Priyanka. Keep your distance. I moved to the building in January. You mean you moved into this building in January. Yes, to the building. Not to the building. Into this building. I'm going out to buy some essentials for the senior citizens of this building. Do you need anything? Did I ask for your help? No. Do I look old and helpless to you? Sorry, Aunty. Archana ma'am. Pull up your mask. It's meant to cover your nose. Not your chin. Got it? Are you breaking your house down in anger? Stay away from my plants. Rat! It's huge! Like a mongoose! So? I wasn't aware that there was a railway platform outside my house. That rat crawled into my bed. I'm not afraid of cockroaches or lizards. Just rats. You can't sleep here. But I can't go anywhere else. You mean you have nowhere else to go. I'll complain to the cops. For poor language? And poor pronunciation! The landlord says he can't do anything about the rat... because of the lockdown. I can't go over to my friend's place... because of the lockdown. She can't come over either... because of the lockdown. Where's your family? I can't even go home. -because of the lockdown. -Because of the lockdown. I got it. Stay six feet away from me at all times! Keep your mask and gloves on. And stay put. Why are you here? Go there! And stay away from me! Dieting. What happened? There's nothing there! Shut up! To get rid of the rat, place garlic and onions outside the house. And some... jaggery. This lures it to come in. I mean, it goes out. You may stay with me tonight. Hurry up! Pack minimally. Okay, Archana ma'am. How did it break? Better? Yes. For now. What's so funny? Everyone in the building had warned me about you. Warning? That I'm a dangerous old hag who's always cribbing and complaining. Not at all. You're out of here the second that rat is out. -Understood? -Yes. -Let me do that for you. -There's no need. It's fine. -Please, let me help. -I said there's no need... I really thought things would return to normal in June. Then came August and finally October. Now I feel we're stuck in this lockdown forever. You have your whole life ahead of you. Now think of me. I'm spending my last few years in a lockdown... listening to advice I never even asked for! Some say... "Madam, at your age you must be very careful." "Do not step out." Others say, "Madam, you must step out." "Go for a walk everyday else your immunity will drop... and you'll succumb to the virus." And then there are some who say... "This is not a fatal virus." "The young can easily survive it but the elderly won't." The young think we've lived beyond our years. When you turn 65, I'll ask you if you feel you've lived enough. By the way, I've made some space for you. You can keep your things there. Thank you, Archana ma'am. I'm recording. Come on, start singing! I wish to Take flight And merge with you I wish to touch the sky -I've never seen these -As I come forth -vintage cassettes before. -Let there be no ties -You sing so well. -And I live freely and fully My mother sings really well too. I'm not your mother! You keep saying the same thing, sir! Please understand! -The shoot got done in February, sir! -That's not my problem. I need to pay my rent! This has been going on for the longest time. -It will take time, Priyanka. -Please make the payment. -You refuse to listen! -My funds are also stuck. I need to pay my rent! -I finished the shoot in February. -Call me after the lockdown ends. Hello? Hello, sir! The producer says he has no money. How will he pay me? Pronounce your words correctly. You don't know the language and you want to be an actor! Actor? I'm a production designer, Archana ma'am. What's that? We design and construct shooting sets. I mean, I'm an assistant. Come. And yes, not everyone can speak Hindi correctly. Just like not everyone can speak Marathi correctly. I've made lunch. Come and eat if you want to. So, your work has been stalled? And I have no idea when it will resume. Do you earn well enough? Not at the beginning but eventually, yes. Which means you weren't dieting. Do your parents know? May I? My parents believe the movie industry is a bad place. We can't succeed here on our own. And I want to prove them wrong. They stopped talking to me after I moved here. And if I tell them what I'm going through, they will win. They don't want to win. They're just worried about you. If that is so, why did they stop talking to me? They're punishing you... so that you give up and go back to them. Do you have children? No. But I've seen enough of life. Sorry. Oh lord! She's a smart one. How do you know it's a girl? Wouldn't have been this smart if it were a boy. Clearly, we've had similar experiences. You're just a kid. What experience could you possibly have? I have some. But I've heard they all fall in line after thirty? Rubbish. They never do. Happy birthday, Vinay. You don't like walnuts? But he did. Did your husband make those tapes? When did he die? You mean, when did he pass away? -Yes. -It's been ten years. You must miss him a lot? Vinay missed me more. We had a love marriage, much against everyone's wishes. I was from Uttar Pradesh and he, from Mumbai. Things were fine up till Dalhousie. But soon after... things just started falling apart. Sometimes... no matter how hard you look, you won't find a reason. Vinay did everything he could. And yet, we kept growing apart. And then one day he stopped trying. And we got separated. My sister kept saying... Vinay needs you. Just like you need him. But I was young. And my ego was bigger than my need. One day... he had a heart attack... and won this fight forever. Why did you stop singing? Don't make the same mistakes I made. You don't want to turn out to be a crabby, old woman like me someday. Got it? C'mon, call your mother now. And say what? The truth. C'mon, call her. -Now? -Yes, now. It's late. So? Is there ever a wrong time to call your mother? C'mon, call her. Pri? Hello, sweetheart. How are you? I've been better, Mom. But I'm your daughter. And I'll take care of it. O dear cloud Hear my request Shower again In my courtyard It's been ages since you poured This season, drench my heart Every bit of me gets wet with you That's how you pour Every bit of me gets wet with you Till my mind goes crazy My mind goes crazy Every bit of me gets wet... Run! Shut the door! Damn. I've left the keys inside. -Prakash sent you? -Yes. Step inside. Not that way. Get in from the back. Quickly. Get in quickly! I have sanitized it. -How many passengers? -Three. No, two adults and a kid. The kid will have to sit in your lap. Okay? We will leave on the 6th and arrive in two days. There will be five more passengers. Pay half in advance and lock the deal. How much? Seven thousand. So, fourteen for two people? Of course. It's not a short distance! Hospitals are refusing COVID patients... and I am helping you reach home. Isn't that enough? Don't even try. The gas connection is not working. Okay, make me some tea. We are out of milk. But I got some yesterday! Monu finished it. Where's Monu? Must be around. Probably playing somewhere. How many times have I told you not to step outside? But what should I do? The landlord has thrown me out and even you have not paid me. I went to his office and argued. I am not asking you to argue with them. You asked for a week but it's been three now. I am running out of food. Where are you putting up? Hello? Hello. Where are you putting up? I told you! At my cousin's place. I can't wait much longer. Wait for another week. I'll do something for you. Things will be back to normal by then and work will begin. You are again asking for a week's time. Prakash, this is not going to end. It was supposed to end in 21 days but it's been two months. Is it Seema? Yes. So, you have put the phone on speaker! What were you saying? You were going to tell us about the train. Have trains started running? Prakash, you told us about the trains. There's no clarity. I'll let you know. How far is Paradise building from your uncle's place? It's far. Why? There is some electrical issue there. Could you take a look? But, I am a painter. How will I do electrical work? It's a minor glitch, won't even take you two minutes. I'll do this, but please get me my money. Don't worry. I'll get you the money in a week. Okay. I'll go. Bye. Okay. Bye. Monu, please eat. Babu… Babu... let's eat. Tiger Shroff has uploaded a new Tuk-Tuk video. Where did I put my phone? You want to watch it? Then finish your food. -Which guard is on duty tomorrow? -Who cares! Migrant laborers returning home from Punjab couldn't control their anger. Along with some other migrants present there they blocked the highway. Hey! Hold it! The place is locked down for the next 6 months. Prakash has sent me. Who? There was some electrical work. Yes. Okay. Stay where you are. It's 33. If it was 35, you would be in the hospital right now. Close shave! Wear a good mask. Handkerchiefs are useless. Those damned Chinese are responsible for this illness. Even the Americans couldn't save themselves. We are also a great country, but it's too crowded. We are no match for the virus. This way. My family is in the village. Had they been here, they would have gotten stuck too. Have the trains started running? Have they? I am asking you. No clue. Everything has shut down. The construction work here should have finished by now. I have asked them to switch on the CCTV camera. How can I look after the whole property on my own? I can't climb 22 floors everyday. But no one cares. They don't pay heed to people like us. Do they? Monu, what a mess you have made! Your father will beat you up if he sees this. Why is Papa always angry? If you don't clean up your act, even I will get angry. Sit. -Tell me. -Prakash has sent me. Who? I want to book a train ticket. My name is Manish. Have you done a Corona test? We'll have to do a test as well? You'll have to do much more and I can't guarantee you a ticket. Where do you want to go? Bhagwada. Where? Bhagwada, Rajasthan. I can't guarantee anything. Put down your details and I'll let you know. Pay me later. Take the bus. Please get us out of here. It's getting difficult. We have a kid with us. What can I do? Hundreds of people come here everyday. Everybody is struggling. I am trying my best. Put down your details. Wait a minute. Had we left that day, we'd be there by now. Vimal and Kusum have already reached. Could you walk all the way with a kid? Our village is far away. And what about my payment? Who's paying you right now? No one knows anything about trains or busses. And that guy was demanding for 14,000 rupees. Prakash will definitely pay us. Prakash is a liar. You're getting to live in luxury. Isn't it fun? When our money gets over, I'll serve you this luxury for dinner. Monu… Can't you be happy for once? Monu! Where are you? Why did you write me a letter, O beloved Why did you write me a letter Did you like my letter, O beloved Did you like my letter Join me on TikTok And let's set the mood right Come into my arms and I will tell you No! No! No! No! Did you like my letter, O beloved Did you like my letter Join me on TikTok And let's set the mood right Come into my arms and I will tell you No! No! No! No! I need flowers for worship. Pull over. That's it. Listen up! Where are you heading? Have you eaten anything? Want some? Can I get some more? There are more people at home and no one has eaten anything. The contractor didn't pay us. With no money to pay rent, the landlord threw us out. Our supplies are almost over, no one has eaten properly. How many people are there? Four. Give her three more. Where are you from? Rajasthan. Okay. Which city do you like better? That one or this? Mumbai. What do you like about Mumbai? Everything. People… houses… food… And? People like to help the poor. -The city that feeds us is the best. -Right! Very good! Listen, take this. This is a mask. Pull it over your ears. -Make sure you always wear it. -Yes. -Wash your hands regularly. -Yes. Very good. Thank you. CORONA: IF YOU STEP OUT, YOU BRING ME HOME. IF YOU STAY HOME... Take off your mask. This is you, right? And that's your wife? Yes. Where did you shoot this? At my boss's house. And your boss didn't mind? He's not here. Wow! Anyone can become a star now! Carry on. Hi, Prakash. Bastard! Since when have you been shacking up in the Paradise sample flat? You have been lying to me! I just saw your video. You and your wife are enjoying yourselves! Just because I am kind to you... you think you can piss on me? Mother fucker! Look, madam. I don't enjoy troubling you every night. But it's these times we're currently in. It's not like I'm going for a stroll. I just want to go get medicines from the medical store. Why can't you do all your chores in the day? No venturing out after 7. -It's not allowed. -Listen to me. Especially senior citizens. Seniors! Why don't you just make it easier for yourselves? Just put us "seniors" in jail. Look, here's my doctor's prescription. -Rickshaw, come here. -I... -Come here. -He's clearly told me to take this medicine. Just have a look. Listen. -Take madam to the closest medical store. -No! I won't get into a rickshaw! I am not allowed. I've been-- Hey, are you deaf? Didn't you hear me? Madam, get in the rickshaw. Come on. No... Madam... Either you get into this rickshaw or go back home. Please. You're not even wearing your mask. Madam, I clean my rickshaw every morning. Would anyone call this Mumbai looking at these streets? It's almost as if I miss the traffic jams. It's better this way. Fewer the people, the better it is. Hey, where are you taking me? Madam, Apollo medical, right? Yes, but what is this road you've chosen? This is a shortcut, ma'am. That's why. No... This is not done. You should've asked first. Come on... -Turn around, please. -What, madam? -I said, turn the vehicle around! -Madam... Or I'll call the Police, I mean it. Turn around. This is not done. You should've asked first. -I am dialing the Police. -Madam. Look, we've reached the main road. Hello... No one was planning on kidnapping you, madam. Even we risk our lives by letting strangers in each day. Hurry up, madam. The meter's running. Shall I get them for you instead? They don't have this medicine now. It'll be available in a couple of days. Okay. -Thank you. -Madam. Mind the potholes, please. Madam, what has happened to you? Thank you. Madam, my card. No, no. Just give me a call in case you need anything. I'll just leave it here. Namaste, madam. -Tomato juice. -Yes. -Two packets of milk. -Yes. -Baked beans. -Yes. -Carrots. -How many kgs of it? No, the canned ones. Canned? Madam. Oh yeah, right. I have kept the change inside the bag. Thank you. And now for an update on the rising Covid cases. Malad, Kurla, and Andheri East along with wards S and M... have turned into hotspot areas. The BMC is putting the areas in a complete lockdown again. We request you to wear your mask... You've heard this song before? Of course, thousands of times. But in a different lifetime. My brother is a big Amir Khusrow fan. Is he older or younger? Twin. Your twin! How nice. The thing about twins is that they are double the fun. One does mischief and the other faces the music. If I had a twin and I'd smoke, he'd be the one who'd get caught. Smoking was out of the question. We would get scolded even if we bought those phantom candy cigarettes. We'd both get scolded. You know, a brother and sister that are twins share a very unique bond. I don't think there's any bond like this one. When we were kids, I'd start a sentence and he'd finish it. He... Feels like you're missing him. Careful. Careful. Sorry, madam. Thank you, madam. Balloon. Here, keep this. I could've given him another one. That was for you. No, that's okay. I just broke my fast, so I'm full. How do you people manage to do it? You don't eat anything the whole day? Not even water. That's why we observe roza. To be able to understand the plight of those that have less than us, and at the same time be happy and thankful for what we have. Even both my daughters observe roza. One's four and the other one, six. At such a young age? Yes. Do you break your fast with them? No madam, they live in the village. Have you heard of Bijnor? I had actually booked tickets to go back home for Eid. Two months in advance. But then... the world suddenly changed. What are you going to do now? What can one do, madam? I'm here. I haven't seen their faces in two months. Even seeing their names flash on the phone gives me happiness. I try and keep my spirits up. Your kids must be living abroad, right? How did you presume I have children? No, madam, I just... Don't be fooled by my grey hair. How can I have kids? I never even got married. You never got married? Why? Is marriage some kind of achievement? No, I mean... I can't even think about living alone the rest of my life and not getting married. Do you know the meaning of being alone? Independent. I'm a person of free will. Madam, tell me something. If a person doesn't get married, then how is he ever going to have a family? And if he doesn't have a family, how is he to form relationships? Like father, mother, children... siblings. They are who we call "our" people. If we neither have "our" people nor these relationships then, a person is alone. And when a person is alone, he's no better than an animal. I like animals... much more than humans. And what about you? You ride from pillar to post in this rickshaw in a city you're not from and your wife's somewhere else. What can be worse than that? I can't live my life like you. You only eat canned food. You have no one to talk to. At least I have someone to talk to, even if it's on the phone. You've no one to even fetch your medicines. Look in front! Mind the potholes! Guests all day. As well as your aunt. She brought meat for the special occasion. She always over spices things and ruins it. I like the way you make it. You should cook it. I see... Sure, but for whom? Ma... we want to talk to abbu. No, me first. -Hello. -Hello, my dear. -Abbu, do you know what happened today? -Yes? -Ammi cut my hair today. -Really? -Herself. -Really? But I don't know if it'll look the same by the time you return. Father, listen. Abbu, listen. When will come back? When do we get to see you again? You know what... this time when you look at the moon during Eid, you'll see my face alongside it. -Promise? -Promise? Promise. That's enough. Say goodnight to your father. -Goodnight, Abbu. -Goodnight, Abbu. I told you I can't allow you inside the building. Stand back. Stand there. I've called on the intercom. Now stay back. There was a medicine the other day you couldn't get. I've brought that for you. Don't worry, it's been sanitized. Madam! Madam! There's one more thing... Just like when I was growing up my parents used to force their opinion on me that I shouldn't drive a rickshaw. I realized that I was trying to force my opinion on you yesterday. That's all I wanted to say. Rafiq. By any chance do you know of a smooth road? Madam, would you like to break my roza with me? I believe if you earnestly wish for something, it'll come true. If only I could see the moon now. Chand Mubarak, Rafiq. Chand Mubarak to you too. Thank you. Would you like some more? No, thank you. Rafiq. My children would be so excited to break their roza with a candy cigarette. I told them this time that when they look at the moon they'll see their father's face alongside. Umesh died last month. He passed away. I couldn't get myself to go to the hospital. And then later even to his house. I couldn't muster the courage. It feels like a part of me has died with him. -Madam, Umesh... as in your... -My brother! My twin. I love this time of day. Let it be, madam. Madam, it's on the house. You know, you're away from your family... but you're not alone. Now with this, you can call them and even see them when you like. -Madam... -Keep this. Consider it your gift for Eid. Thank you, ma'am. Call me Uma. Uma didi. Or older sister. Older sister.
