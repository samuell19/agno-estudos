-[inaudible] is here, so just sit back and relax, take yours shoes off, call your best man, call your best woman, because I am going to give you some nice hometown blues. -Half wild, half child-- that's what it says on a silver chain a friend of mine always wears. When you're holding a camera in your hand, you're saying the same thing. My camera bag is covered with drawings of elephants. It was stashed beneath the seat of the car as we turned off route 40 and headed west through Joshua Tree National Park in the spring of 1997. The window was down and sand was blowing in my eyes, as I tried to edit some contact sheets while a friend of mine drove. We were listening to "Sweetheart of the Rodeo," and I was reminded of Gram Parsons, whose life ended in Joshua Tree in 1973. I thought about how Gram was so beautiful that Mick Jagger wrote "Wild Horses" for him. On my contact sheets, I saw all these photographs that I had just done in Los Angeles of Peter Johnson and giant poodles. The poodles came from Denmark and were famous because they ran like little ponies, but they all had the continental clip, which makes them look like they're on their way to a birthday party. There were photographs of Peter lying down with a poodle covering him because he was a little shy at that time about being nude. As I pause to look at the desert, one of the contact sheets flew right out the window. We stopped the car, and we all got out to look for it, but we couldn't find it. After about 10 minutes, we gave up and just started laughing, thinking that some hitchhiker or lonesome cowboy would come by someday and he'd pick it up and see this nude boy with a giant white poodle. [MUSIC - "BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC"] -In 1996, a group of wrestlers and I came to this wrestling camp of Dan Gable's in Iowa. These wrestlers were on my high school team. We had been in awe of Dan Gable for ages-- I mean, ever since I was a freshman in high school. I started wrestling in second grade, and it's been 12 years. I was in the gym, and there were 1,200 wrestlers there. And there was this photographer who came in. He was with a group of his friends, and he just started taking pictures of me. I was wrestling with this kid, and we just started flipping and doing all these tosses and turns and showing off in front of the camera. After Bruce took those pictures, they asked me for my phone number. He talked to my mom and dad about me coming to New York to do some photographs. My brother, little Mikey, wasn't too impressed. He told me if I started acting stuck up, he wouldn't hang with me anymore. But from then on, my life was changed. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] -It is blue butterfly day here in spring, and with these sky flakes down and flurry on flurry, there is more unmixed color on the wing than flowers will show for days unless they hurry. -The only club I was ever a member of was the Outrigger Canoe Club in Honolulu. I liked the Mai Tais and the Gabby Pahinui music. But after meeting Peter, my friends and I got together and we started to take pictures of him, the way camera clubs used to, over and over again, dressing and undressing him, like a character in a coloring book. We all realized we'd been the kind of kids who had grown up in tree houses, where we hung out alone, except for maybe a dog or a stray cat we carried up there. And our afternoons were filled with looking at old postcards of elephants from Burma and photographs of Guy Madison and Robert Mitchum or just laying around reading "Patsy and Hedy" comic books and listening to bootleg copies of Frances Faye, "Caught in the Act." My father would yell up to me, why don't you do something serious with your life, like be a doctor or a lawyer? But then my mom gave me my first camera, and being a hellbent kid, I've been going my own way ever since. -Well, I think she's the great-- well, she's the greatest in her field. This is Frances Faye. -Thank you, Ed. Thank you very much. -Let's have a go at them, eh? -I-- where are you going? -I'm going to be right here watching you. [MUSIC - "DARKTOWN STRUTTERS BALL"] -Frances Faye was different from every other girl singer. She sang about sex and desire, and she crossed the line over and over again. To appear on "The Ed Sullivan Show," they made her wear fancy dresses and big hairdos. Well, they tried to make her a square. And as my friend Donald used to say, you're dancing on the head of a pin and all they can say is faster. She did "The Ed Sullivan Show," and that's a real nerve-wracking show because there's no cutting. It's live. It was a very, very tight show, "The Ed Sullivan Show." He was-- he was hard to deal with. She would talk to him, and he was so shy, he would run from her. But she was nervous herself-- when she said, where are you going and stuff like that. But once she got to the people and that first song would get down. Then the comfort would come in, and then she'd really start to roll. A friend of mine was a jazz hound. He loved Fran, so they took me in to see her. We were all sitting there. And all of a sudden, she started with a good evening. The lights were all dark. And all of a sudden a pin spot came on, and there was Fran. And she jolted out, good evening, and the lights came up. -Now the Crescendo proudly presents the fabulous Frances Faye. -And all of a sudden, that-- she started to move that whole room. I mean, it was fantastic. And we went-- we watched the whole show. And everybody was up like this. I mean, she raised the house. -(SINGING) Good evening. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. How do you do? -Before she went on stage, she came over to our table and said hello and left her little bag, you know, her little purse there. And she said, I'll see you after the show. [music - "night and day"] -And, uh, that's how it all started, just like that. And she said, well, let's go to California. I need someone to work for me and travel with me. And I became her personal manager. -It's so great to get lost in a record store. That's how I found Francis Faye's "Caught in the Act." The album cover looked like a scandal sheet-- about a lady with a boy's haircut and lots of eyeliner. I took it along with me to college, and while everybody in my fraternity was listening to Janis Joplin, I was listening to Frances Faye. When I went home at Easter and put the record on, my parents just rolled their eyes and said, now what are you listening to? -What have you found now? Which way are we going now? -And I've been carrying it around with me ever since. [singing] [singing] -Bruce's friends gave me such strange outfits to wear. One day I'd be dressed up like a Burmese prince-- lots of silk scarves and a turban. Next time I'd be in a fancy gown. Back home, I tried on the turban and just walked into our family room, and my little brother cracked up. He ran into his room and put on a Green Bay Packers hat. It's shaped like a wedge of cheese, and it actually converts into a holder for two cans of beer. After that we just hung out, watching TV together and wearing our hats. My dad came home, and when he saw us, he just shook his head and laughed. He told my mother the whole family was going nuts. -One day I was in a small bookstore off Canal Street, and I found an old paperback cookbook called "Chop Suey." I can't even fry an egg and I never read cookbooks, but I thought "Chop Suey" was a crazy enough name for a camera club dedicated to making a photo album of a kid from Wisconsin. -I could use that. That's a Larry Clark book. -Oh. -I just love the black and white, how rich it is. -We were laughing the other day, talking about these books that they sell, you know, these photo manuals. They tell you how to take a beautiful photograph. One of my favorite photo manuals is the Bunny Yeager book "How to Photograph Yourself in the Nude." -Do you know who that guy is up there on the left? -Who is it? -Oh, that's Paul Cadmus, the painter by George Platt Lynes. He lived to be 95. -Well, do you know who that is over there, smoking that cigarette? -No, but he looks pretty cool. -Jean Cocteau. -Jean Cocteau. -It was George Platt Lynes right there. That's by Cecil Beaton. -I've never seen a photograph of it. I've only seen books. -Who is this, Bruce? -This is a photograph of Bill Miller by George Platt Lynes. -Really? -He was the party boy of New York. He was photographed by everybody. He became a recluse, and he killed himself. -Makes me want to have a cigarette. Do you want-- do you have a cigarette. -[interposing voices] -No? -Here's Alfred Stieglitz taken by Cartier-Bresson. And these are photographs of Stieglitz and Georgia O'Keeffe in between one of their famous photo sessions at Lake George. I've never seen them so relaxed. -Definitely. -Yeah. -They were always so driven about their place in the art world. -Too bad. -He was such a ladies' man, Auka. -I know. I could see that. I mean, look at Georgia. I mean, you could tell she was just crazy about him. -[speaking foreign language] -Who was she referring to when she said that? -She was referring to Edward Weston. -Really? -To me, Edward Weston's photographs are all about the romance of a family living in photography. -Do you see the fixer on the finger? -That's the sun. -That's coal, right there. -Some photographers. -That's sweet. -Edward grew up in California and married a woman named Flora, and they had four sons. Later he met Margrethe Mather, and they started an affair. They'd go into the dark room together to make prints and make love. When Edward left her to go off to Mexico with Tino Modotti, Margrethe became a heroin addict. I sometimes wonder if Edward hadn't had a camera if he would have had so many women in love with him. -Huh. -This is a photograph of the whole Weston family, taken by his son Brett. -Oh, a good-looking family, though. -Yeah. -Edward left all his sons in LA with Flora when he went off to Mexico. While he was there, he sent countless letters to the boys, telling them how much he missed them. Sometimes Brett would go down to Mexico, and help his dad take photographs, carrying his 3 and 1/4 by 4 and 1/4 Graflex. When Brett was in his 60s, I was introduced to a girl in Carmel who was having an affair with him. She told me she could sell me this photograph if I met her at 10 o'clock at night with the money. It sort of felt like a drug deal. I was almost broke, but I went out with Nea, we drank margaritas, and then we went to the corner to meet her. I really feel lucky now to have that picture. It just brings back all the craziness of family, love, sex, and neuroses. -All these different photographs and, like, living so closely to their work that their work is-- is their life. It's just such an important thing. You can see it's just coming directly out of them. -Yeah. -These are the photographs of Edward's second wife, Charis, from the book "California in the West." -And the way he photographed them as, like, goddesses. -Absolutely. -There's, like, nothing to hide-- so beautiful. -He was able to attract all these incredible women. -I think that he was really kind of obsessed about women and what they were to him in his life. I think there were two things-- the camera and a woman. -His muse, basically. That's beautiful. -You can tell, like, how Edward really loved Charis' body. They had this great attraction to making something beautiful out of their desire. -It wasn't my-- you know, the craziest fight, because my dad said, oh, that's gonna be easy. Go, go-- and I-- you know, I have my doubts. In the beginning, I have, uh, what we call lucky shot. He come in to grab me, and I move back and use my knee right on his face. And it was very bloody. He lost a tooth and stuff. And I felt like I won the fight, and he just shake the head and keep coming in. I said, wow, that's power. -I remember the first time that I went to see my dad fight in Japan. In Japan when he fights, it's, like, a big ring, and there's 50,000 people, and 90% of them are against him, and they're rooting for the other guy, because they're Japanese. And so we just have to stay there and be strong, and we have to support my dad and we can't let him know that we're worried. -My ego or my desire to win, I have to use a strategy. I must adapt myself and take the weakness of my opponent. And that's a big lesson for me. And since then I've been more and more strategically prepared for my flights. -When I first met Rickson, the thing that attracted me to him was probably that I felt he was so sweet and really a nice person with people. And we have a connection, that kind of remembering someone who lived many times before. -Maybe we are already friends in the past life or something. It's a good energy connection. Fighting is not my goal. I don't like the-- the actual aggressiveness of the fight. -I met Rickson Gracie when I went to Brazil to work on my book "O Rio de Janiero." I kept hearing about this jiu-jitsu champion who walked down the toughest streets of Brazil carrying bananas on his head. Nobody would mess with him. When he came to live in America, I tried to figure out ways to keep photographing him. Once I hired him to portray a bodyguard in a commercial I did with Elizabeth Taylor. Rickson was such a great destraction for her that she only kept us waiting on the set for six hours. Rickson kept trying to teach me jiu-jitsu. He taught his students that you can take on a fighter of any size if you really have the will to win. I believed him, but I never got the hang of it. And all I ended up with was a sprained ankle and a great collection of Gracie jiu-jitsu T-shirts. -Love is an amazing feeling, and I'm-- I'm proud to have a lot of love to give to you guys and be able to sacrifice anything for you guys. I don't find myself a fighter. I find myself a teacher. I carry a tradition of the family. -When you see the trophy, it's like, finally we can grab it and go, but it's never over. And it's never over. There's always another trophy to be won, another fight to be fought. -Take you this way. Get you in a headlock. -How about if I grab you from the back like this and choke you out? You give up? Huh? -I really liked hearing that music. I mean, what a job. You know, this was a pleasure. And, um, I never had another job after that. Later on, after I got to know Fran, she made up some matches, and they said, just Teri. So that should explain it. So Fran and I were together for 31 years. Frances wanted her mom to come out to California. And, um, she did. She liked the fact that I was taking care of Fran and that Fran had someone that was really looking after her and everything. And-- and she knew that Fran and I were together. But it was a little strange because Fran's mom was from Russia, and she-- she was really not aware of the gay scene. But I-- I kept talking to her every day and being close to her and as compassionate and just getting to know her. And all of a sudden, she said to Fran one day, she says, Fran-- oh, she-- you know, she talked to Fran. She says, you know, Teri, I really, really like her. She's the best son-in-law I've ever had. She was trying so hard to make Fran feel comfortable in being gay, that that's-- that was her way of-- Fran almost fell on the floor. -I'd like to bring forth at this time my sax man who is also very brilliant on flute. There is a chap that wants me, but I would never-- never. I look like I would, but I really wouldn't. He looks like he wouldn't, but he would. -Basically all these are Walt. -Yes. -I got enough of them. -Here, kids. Cars don't lie up in there. -Whoa, work it. Work it. -F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote, "In the sight of paradise, I don't want to repeat my innocence. I want the pleasure of losing it again." -It's too deep. I was passed away. -You guys are good at cards. -So you think, uh, fives and eights are wild? -If you put your cards on the table, a pair of aces beat-- -I got a straight, my good man. -Well, maybe twos are wild. -I think that was you. -Game over. -So we're all sitting here, you know, loosening up a little bit. Let's talk about the good stuff. -OK. -When was your first time with a girl? What was it like? -Hey, Louie, there's Robert Mapplethorpe when he was very young. -Did he have a sense of humor? I mean-- -Big sense of humor. -Oh, really? -No one thinks of him that way. -Robert used to go fishing. He was a really good fisherman. -Oh, wow. -Really? -Huh. -That's Patti Smith and Sam Shepard on the fire escape of the Chelsea Hotel by David Gahr. -She lives around here. I see her on the streets. -This is a photograph I travel a lot with. -It's Allen Day Long and Luchino Visconti by a good friend of mine, Ronnie McDowell. I always though this photograph was all about the photographer being in love with the subject. -Huh. -Wasn't, um, what's his name in that? -Lancaster. -Burt Lancaster. -Yeah, right. Did you read that book that just came out on Burt? -No, I haven't yet. No. So great. -Here's Lana Turner, drunk at a party by Ruth Orkin. -That's the back of Esther Williams. And there's Fernando Lamas. This is a photograph by Horace Bristol of a Royal Air Force pilot during World War II, making a rescue in the English Channel. -Wow. That's amazing. -When I asked Horace for this picture, he said, you always want the photographs I love the most. -Doing the perfect thing at that moment when you have the camera in your hand-- usually one thing goes wrong, you know? -Was that on the set of this? -"Ocean's 11." -Ocean 11? Yeah? -This is a photograph of the Rat Pack by Phil Stern. -Dean Martin. -Look at Sammy Davis, Jr. on the left. -Always joking around. -Besting each other out. -I always thought Dean Martin was, like, the coolest name, though, you know. It sounds cool. -Was this, like, pre-Jerry Lewis, you think, Bruce? -It's funny. Let's think about everything from, like, pre-Jerry Lewis to then after Jerry Lewis. -I have so much fun with industries that come. -Phil Stern had photographed the Rat Pack for many years. And the last time he ever saw Sinatra was on a sound stage near the end of Sinatra's life. Sinatra didn't even remember him, and he said to his bodyguards, get that guy with the camera out of here. Phil said to him, Frank, don't you remember? It's me, Phil Stern. And Frank said to his bodyguard, oh yeah, he was a friend. Let him stay. -Was it pre-Mia Farrow or post-Mia Farrow? -I liked him when he was with Ava Gardner. [MUSIC - "PORGY, I IS YOUR WOMAN NOW"] -Marilyn Monroe didn't know Frances, but I was playing her a record one day, and Marilyn said, what are you playing, Jimmy? And I said, well, that's my best friend, Francis Faye. She said, oh. She said, I want to meet her. And Marilyn, she didn't want to meet too many people. She didn't want to meet anyone, really-- very shy. Fran was always working New York, Chicago, um, and Florida. Those were the main places-- and Vegas. She went from the Thunderbird to the, uh, Old Frontier. She introduced me to Howard Hughes when she was at the Flamingo, El Rancho to Desert Inn. She played them all. -We traveled everywhere. She-- we went to Australia 19 times. We went to London about 11. And we were in Spain. We were in Madrid. We went all over the place. And, uh, Australia-- they really went mad for her. The wildest people of all categories of life would come to see Fran at The Talk of the Town in London. They'd Going thro the tunnels and hide them out. And-- I mean, later on the young kids, like Rod Stewart, she just lit them all. And look how they're looking at her. -I know. Look at Rod Wood back there. -And she was holding court. She'd tell them all-- and when we were in London with all those kids, The Animals, John Lennon, everybody that was over there, the Rolling Stones, they'd all come and see Fran. And Dusty and everybody. All the old actors, all the real fine actors, Fran would know them better than I did, but, uh, they all came. Judy Garland used to come and see Fran. She was a big fan of Fran's. And Fran would sing "Over the Rainbow" to Judy. -I sing when I want to whenever I want to. -We see Judy when she was having all that trouble in Australia. We were all in Australia. I think 2/3 of it was the press, the way they were shredding her-- you know, for not showing up. Fran wanted me to go out and say hello to Judy and, uh, take her a little present. I put them in my mouth. I gave her a little kiss. I said, this will take you to LA. I gave her a couple of Tuinals and, uh, Fran sent them because Fran had them because she had such a bad pain in her leg. So she says take this to Judy and tell her not to get off the flight, just to keep sleeping, and I'll see her in LA. Once you're a friend, you stay a friend. -Buddy Hackett-- you're gonna get it too. -After the show, she didn't want to see anybody for at least 15 minutes so she could, you know, I could touch her up and-- so I'd open the door, and it would be like, you know, oh, Fran, it's Nancy Sinatra. She would say, no, no, no. Not now. And I go, it's Fran-- it's Nancy Sinatra and her father. And she would say, make them wait. I go, OK, you have to wait about 10 minutes. Then Fran will see you. So it was all people like that, you know, from Bette Midler, Bobby Short-- everyone. Everyone came to see Fran. It looked like Las Vegas at a prize fight. -I like that guy, that tough guy behind the camera, you know, just lugging all that stuff. -Hardcore. -Like this kind of camel in his mouth. These are all the chairs from all the cast of "The Misfits." It was a film directed by John Huston. -Who's Thelma Ritter? -She's a character actress. -Oh, really? -It's Marilyn Monroe's husband at the time, Arthur Miller. He's a playwright and a screenwriter. During this time, they were having a lot of problems. You can see it in some of the pictures. -Yeah, she looks really sad. Wow. -This was shot in Nevada, and it's about catching wild horses and taking them to a glue factory. -Oh, there's Marilyn Monroe. She looks very young in that picture. I've seen that photograph before. I remember that dress. -She wore this dress in a-- in a bar scene. It's really well known. That's Ava Gardner. Do you know who she is? -No, I don't. -She was this wonderful actress who has lived in Spain for a while, had a lot of affairs with bullfighters and-- -Is that her right there, to the right? -Yeah, on the right too, yeah. Dick Bogarde told me that she did a scene once with her hair all wet, almost like the way she looks right there. And she was really proud of her work. And it-- the studios made her redo it again because her hair was wet. -Why is that? -Well, because the audience had never seen her look like that ever before. -That's weird. -Yeah, she just never felt like she ever could really be herself. Wow, there's George Cukor. Uh, he was a very famous director in Hollywood. And when I first started taking photographs, I got a chance to do his portrait. You know, I photographed Jeff Equell in there. -Really? -When I first met him too. Yeah. -How did he like that? -Well, Mr. Cukor liked it. He walked out of the house, and he saw Jeff standing there in a red bathing suit. And he said, now this is Hollywood. You know, when he died-- it was really kind of sad. They took all his great collection of photographs and his library of amazing books and, uh, they sold them. I've never kept them together. -OK. Oh-- that's one of those drive-in movie theaters. -Yeah. I used to hang out there a lot when I was about your age. You know, it was kind of the only place to go when you lived in a small town. Do they still have them in Wisconsin? -No, they don't. Never been to one. -Well, we used to go to them, you know. You either had to go with your parents. When you got older, you'd find somebody to go with, and you'd keep your fingers crossed that they, um, didn't want to watch the movie, if you know what I mean. -Yeah, I bet. It was very magical, right? -Yeah. It was kind of like one's first introduction in a small town to what life might be like outside of your backyard. -Buster? Do you like my hair black? I mean-- I mean, maybe brown would be better. -I'll tell you something, Whitey. I've been thinking about dying my hair black like yours. Looks real good. -Daphne Davis, an editor at "Vanity Fair" magazine once gave me some advice on photographing celebrities. Just remember, she said, movie stars are not your best friends. But that wasn't always true. I first met Jan-Michael Vincent while he was on location for a film at Chama, New Mexico, in 1972. I'll never forget it. It was my first assignment. I was so nervous. Jan came to the door of his cabin completely soaking wet, wearing only a towel, and invited me right in. That day was just the two of us, and we wound up spending the whole afternoon together, swapping stories and taking photographs, smoking joints, and playing Jan's guitar. -You can't think about life, Whitey. You just gotta live it. -Oh, you said it, Ski Pole. You know, I-- I got me this philosophy. I figure life is sort of like a great big juicy steak, and you gotta eat it all and don't leave nothing to waste. -The next morning he drove up in his red pick up, and we went to a diner and split a breakfast of steak and eggs. I hated to say goodbye. He was a real sweetheart. --always making fun of me. -It's 'cause I like you. See you in the morning. -And another great thing about Jan was that we both shared a fascination with Robert Mitchum. -This day-- [whistling]. [MUSIC - "WHEN IT'S SLEEPY TIME DOWN SOUTH"] -John Bryson, the "Life" magazine photographer, told me that Robert Mitchum had a sign on his front door that said, gone fishing. And if you rang his bell and he saw a camera in your hand, he just slammed the door in your face. When I told Bob that story, he just shook his head. Do you believe everything you hear, he asked me. Now can I get you a martini? -That key feels all right? -Good as any, I guess. -OK. [MUSIC - "WHEN IT'S SLEEPY TIME DOWN SOUTH"] -It was great. -You think it was too Jewish? -Well, we could-- we can do one more just for-- for safety. -For safety's sake, right? -That was great, though. -When I was a freshman at Denison University, instead of studying I spent all my time photographing my friends in the theatre department and on the lacrosse team. These senior portraits on motorcycles and cars became a record of the days before they graduated and were called up for the war in Vietnam. It was a war none of us understood, and it was the saddest graduation I ever saw. In the early '80s, one of my first assignments was in Honolulu, photographing soldiers on leave. They lived in a world without women and they talked like characters from Norman Mailer's book "The Naked and the Dead." One night I invited all of the these soldiers to have dinner with me and my crew at the Outrigger Canoe Club. The Army, the Navy, the Marines, and the Coast Guard, they don't normally go out drinking together. They kept excusing themselves from the table to go into the men's room to fight, and they'd come back out with black eyes and bloody noses. But by the time the sun came up, half of them were passed out, and the other half were kissing and dancing together. All through that long night, photographing these soldiers on Hotel Street, I kept remembering my old friends and how much fun it was to take pictures of them trying to get wasted on 3.2 beer at the Dew Drop Inn back in Ohio. Before they were drafted, we all lived as if we were immortal. People always ask me what kind of camera, film, and aperture I used in these photos. Honestly, I can't remember, because all I can remember is not how I chose the F-stop and pressed the shutter, but why. -Gay, gay, gay-- is there another way? Now, it's just a rhyming thing, and-- and she wanted everybody to be free in this world. That-- that was her whole-- like, whatever you're doing, if you do it with taste, class, don't hurt anyone. That was her thing. Like, don't be square and stop everybody from their way of expressing themselves. -If you ever saw me offstage, you'd kill yourself. I'm much younger than he-- -Fran was, like, a pioneer in the '50s of the gay kids. Once they heard her say, Frances Faye is a gay, gay, gay. Is there another way? Well, that was just a beautiful opening for them to feel free, and they tried to put her down because she was gay, but she didn't go for that. She was gifted enough to put them straight and not aggravate them. She knew how to shut them right up. And, uh, they would never let her go into the big rooms in Vegas. She'd always have to play the lounge. But all the big room headliners, like Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, Sophie Tucker, Danny Kaye-- everybody was sitting ringside. After their show, they would all be there. Fran was an entertainer's entertainer. She was a wild, wild lady, and she only wanted to have fun. She never meant to bring people into gay life. She meant to make them free once they're aware that they are gay. Why can't they just forget the gay scene and listen to the music? Just let the artists be themselves. -This is my teacher Lisette Model photographed by Imogen Cunningham. Diane Arbus told me to study with her. We used to look at these photographs of mine together, Lisette and I, at the Howard Johnson's on West 8th Street. There were all these pimps and prostitutes and drag queens just hanging out at the counter. Taking photographs for class was always a challenge, because I really wanted Lisette to like my photographs. But she told me that wasn't important. I had to like them myself. Diane Arbus always said, once you photograph somebody, they stay with you forever. This is another series of photographs I did for my class with Lisette. I kept seeing this guy at a bar down in the Village. He was kind of really cocky, you know. He had a lot of ego, and he kept saying to me, I want you to do nude pictures of me. Well, I was just starting out. It was hard to find people who'd do nudes for you, so I felt pretty lucky. But I got a little nervous walking down the dark hallway of his transient hotel on West 8th Street, carrying my only camera. He turned out to be a very gentle guy. He loved his cat and his pet snake, and the walls of his room were covered with drawings he had done of himself. He asked me to help him take off his clothes, and he told me that he had been born like that because his mom had done a lot of drugs. After I'd taken the pictures, he kissed me and thanked me. Don't forget me, he said. And be sure to send me a print. The wonderful thing about having a camera is you never know where it's going to take you. Peter, I knew when I started to photograph you that you were going to meet some people who would hit you like a bolt of lightning. -I had to wear this Campbell's Soup dress. And-- I didn't have to, but I chose to wear a dress. And that was-- that was unique for me, because the last time I did that, I was probably six or seven years old, trying to dress up in Mommy's clothes. -He's cool. -Oh, I remember the time that Pamela Anderson-- [giggling] -Yeah, I remember that. -Coming from Wisconsin, she was a big deal. -Well, I remember, you know, Pete, I was photographing you with Pamela Anderson. And, you know, and I said, Peter, put your arm around her, you know? And you were smiling really wide, this gap in your tooth, you know. She started flirting with you, you know what I mean? And I know you were thinking you can't wait to get back to-- to Wisconsin and tell all the boys. -Tell the guys. -Where's that photograph now? -It's hanging up in my room-- in my parents' house. I have it next to, uh, the photograph of Rickson Gracie and I. I'm starting my own little collection just from all the times we've spent together. And there's a lot of memories there in each of those photographs. -Oh, [speaking foreign language] looked superb. But you know I'm really only envious of one thing, and that is a surfer. I think it's the most beautiful thing. See, I'm mad about water. I think water is God's tranquilizer-- to be in it, to drink it, to look at it. And to be a surfer, ah, between the sky and the water would be, to me, the most wonderful thing. I'm sorry I just didn't make it. -Also to be 19 and blonde and bronzed and beautiful on the edge of the shore. -No, I don't give a damn about that. I only care about the water. Rhythm-- anything that's-- also skateboards, I think, are great. Great. When I see them going past the museum steps at night when I'm coming down the steps, because you see there are no breaks in the sidewalks. You can go on and on and on and on and on. -They do amazing tricks. -Aren't they wonderful? Marvelous. They've got to be natural, you know. They can't have a ball bearing in them, or whatever some of them have. That's cheating. I would say you're cheating. And they don't even hear you. They're in a world all their own. -Dad, don't. I'm gonna fuckin' rub it all over your camera. I'm serious. -I was getting the back of your head. -I don't care. -Fuck head. -I thought about myself as a lot of different things, but I've never really thought about myself as Nixon's neighbor. -We kind of changed it for our family, that it wasn't not playing ball in the house. There was no skateboarding in the house. And the kids never believed it. They always did it anyway. -It's like Hollywood. -Christian, what do you want your son to do when he grows up? -Hm, tough question. Be a complete madman-- surf, skate, snowboard, and play death metal. -I've ridden the fastest and the biggest waves ever ridden, and not many dads can say that. -We went to Kawai when the kids were real young and surfed. -But the best, though, was the Maui stuff. It was so rad. -You can just sort of stretch your mind, and it helps you go out and surf and stretch your mind a little more. -We're a family, but maybe not in the traditional sense. We're a family, but we haven't exactly settled down. Well, we're more like the Addams family. -When Bruce came to do the photo shoot for Christian for "Interview" magazine, Christian at that time was doing just the most radical maneuvers in the surf world. And-- you know, but Christian wasn't quite the surfer that you expected, suntanned and, you know, terrific. And there was Christian with his big old nose ring and tattoos. And he was-- you know, he was just a kid, right, that surfed all the time. So he was really not the norm of what a lot of the surfers are. He didn't want to look like a surfer. He was a surfer. -Being a father, it's really great to be able to go surfing with your kids and go to exotic surf spots like Bali, Cabo, France, and Hawaii. -That was epic. -And it's been really fabulous to be able to grow up with them. -My dad goes out and shreds all the guys that think they're hot on their short board on his longboard out there-- very innovative, and nobody compares when it comes to the longboarding. -Aye aye, captain. -The house is filled with artwork. I've done so many paintings of the kids and surfing and things like this. And I think that having a family of boys that were so active and aggressive, that it forced me to do things. And I painted those kids to actually release the thoughts I had about them. It was kind of a growing process for me. As they were growing into their identity, I was, at the same time, as a mom having to let go. -I love being their friend. I love them being honest to me, and I love being honest to them. And that's how you establish a friendship with somebody, is through real honesty. -Oh, that thing took off, man. -Yeah. -OK, can you tell us the names? Like, I'm doing this maneuver, this maneuver, and this maneuver and landing them backwards. -Uh-- yeah, I'm doing all sorts of maneuvers and landing them backwards-- meters, slobs. -OK, Christian, look at me and talk. -Well, I'm trying to think, and it's hard to think of them over and over again. -I look back, and I see Christian when he was at the height of his career start to make some bad choices, and-- I mean, he went deep, boy. He went as deep as you can go. -I don't know why you fall into it, but you fall into it. And he was down there into heavy drug abuse every day, all day and night, for years. And, um, we couldn't help him. We couldn't do anything about it. And then, all of a sudden, he popped up and said, I'm bored. I'm over it. I don't want to do any of this anymore. -And you know, we all hated his choices, but it didn't change how we felt about him. And you always had to keep that in the front of your mind, so you don't allow those choices of theirs to make you bitter. And one day, Christian just came out the other side, and I want to tell you, we were all free. It changed all of our lives. As soon as he was well, I said, my god, I feel great. I'm going dancing. You come into it with all these preconceived ideas of being a parent, and I think that doesn't allow you the freedom to be their friend. You set up unrealistic goals for yourself and for them, and-- and I think that causes a lot of problems. I think when everyone in the family has the freedom to be who they are and allow themselves true happiness, I think that's the secret. -Loves apart, whom would you most like to see coming up the drive? That's the question Virginia Woolf's friend, Clive Bell, once asked on a rainy afternoon. At first, photographing Peter is a little like asking a question. That sense of longing was what I wanted to put in my early pictures of him. When I was filming Peter and his friends in the shower, I remembered myself at that age. In my fantasy, I would have been one of those kids, clowning around without a care in the world. But back in my hometown of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, it was a different story. I'd be swimming all day at the country club, and my mom would tell me to shower and dress for dinner. I'd tell her I couldn't, because the locker room would be too crowded at that hour. It seemed to me that every guy in the whole Midwest would be in that locker room, showering and dressing for his 6 o'clock dinner. Instead I'd go stand at the sink and wash up, wearing my underwear and towel. We sometimes photograph things we can never be. -Her music, it was like from a different era that was, like, to me, so cool. You know, it was sort of like that-- like, Peggy lee, Keely Smith, Louis Prima, Sam Butera and the Witnesses, the Strip when it was really glamorous-- it's all about having fun. And I'm that friend when I was 22. You know, you met her when you were young, and Tony met her when you were young. You are on tour now that you're young, so this keeps on going-- gotta go, go, go. -Oh, yes. She would be, like, looking at him. -Wouldn't she like him? -Yeah. -She'd say, he's so cute. -Look at that jaw line. -Oh, he's so beautiful. -That chin. Uh-huh-- she would. -You know why? Because he's sweet. He's got a good soul. -This is not dirty. It's the way I say it. (SINGING) I know a guy named Solly. Solly goes with Molly. Molly goes with Charlie. And Charlie goes with Molly. And I go with-- -(SINGING) I know a guy named Joey. Joey goes with Davy, and Davy goes with Howard, and Howard goes with Charlotte, and Charlotte goes with Shirley, and Shirley goes with Pearly, and Pearly goes with Yeva. What a drag. [music - "my coloring book"] [music - "my coloring book"] --(SINGING) goes with Irving, and Irving goes with Marley, and Suzie goes with Sammy, and Sammy goes with-- --on the plane. The two of you didn't know you were on the same plane together. -Right. But we've known each other a long time. -How far back do you go with him? -With him? I was married to Sam in, um-- [laughter] -That's why I turned Jewish, you know. -Because he married you? -Yeah. -Yeah, sure. -And, um, well, we've known each other for a long time, and he's only the most brilliant, really. -Yes, he is. -The world's-- the world's best performer. -Stole half my act, but he's brilliant. -Did he? -(SINGING) And she does good-- -He's one of those men a woman is glad to give a five or a ten-- my extraordinary man. -Oh, by the way-- -Yes, yes? -What's his name? -Oh, you've got me, Shapiro. I can't think of his name. -Well, it looks like he's got you going pretty strong. -Yeah. -Is he an Englishman or a foreigner? -Oh, he's from Paris. He hasn't been here very long. But I've learned from him that 50 million Frenchmen can't be wrong. -Darling, is that you? Wave tonight. What'd you say, love? -That's why I never go with girls. They're so aggressive when they're drinking. -(SINGING) If you had prepared 20 years ago, you wouldn't be wandering now from door to door. Why don't you do right like some other men do? Get out of here and get me some money, too. -Sounds like an exciting life. -It was. I was very lucky, and, uh, I think it was meant to be. I think things just happen sometimes that way. -Destiny. -I had a great, great journey. -(SINGING) 'Cause I know a guy. His name is Willy! -My grandmother sacrificed and placed them there and took us out, and of course always took us to the Louvre. We went crazy with the Louvre. We couldn't stand the Louvre. And the one thing we couldn't stand was the "Mona Lisa." Well, because it was so forced on us, you see. As you know, wherever you stand, the eyes are looking at you. And then we were put here, and we were put there, and we were put here, and we were put there, and we were put here. I thought it would never end, the "Mona Lisa." My God, have we seen the "Mona Lisa" before. [music - "think pink"] [music - "think pink"] -My parents' only reference to the fashion world was the movie "Funny Face," where Kaye Thompson played a Diana Vreeland-type character, and Fred Astaire played Richard Avedon. -Good. Play that. Let me. No, don't move. Go back the way you were. -I preferred the fantasy I saw in "Blow Up," which was sort of a takeoff on a buddy of mine-- the photographer, David Bailey. I once asked David if we were ever to make a film about fashion, what should we call it? And he said-- [MUSIC - BEETHOVEN, "FIFTH SYMPHONY"] -All right, Marcel. Lights. -Take the picture, take the picture. -Azzedine Alaia asked me to film and photograph his collection in 1989. At that time, I wanted to do a film dedicated to Mrs. Vreeland. She was the first magazine editor to use black women in fashion photographs. Naomi Campbell and Veronica Webb were just kids then. They acted so free and beautiful. They had such attitude. -And when you say the whole circle, no, I did not know the whole circle. I knew [speaking foreign language] very, very well-- charming, brilliant. His curiosity was extraordinary. He was mad about watching nails being painted. Oh, there's something to me marvelous about the period Elizabeth I. It took her four hours to get dressed-- so pretty. She loved flowers, and everything was alive inside the palace. If you noticed a cover they chaptered on the paper of some old drawings of women, Japanese women, of 1870, et cetera, in Victorian clothes-- this is 19th century I'm speaking. They adored those clothes. I was asked to come and work. I was frightened to death. But I realized I'd have to because living in New York is quite different from living in London. Nobody could sit here and do nothing. I used to read a book every afternoon in London. Isn't that marvelous? [chuckling] [chuckling] -I once saw an exhibition of photographs by my friend Edouard Boubat. They were of Leila, a woman he fell madly in love with when he was very young. To complicate matters, the two of them met another woman, and they became a trio. They were shy about their relationship, but I believe they all loved each other. I was at a party once in New York City, and I met this sophisticated woman all dressed up in black. She had asked me if I'd ever heard of this French photographer, Edouard Boubat. She told me he was a friend of the families and that he spent a weekend once at their farmhouse in Ohio. All he wanted to do the whole weekend, she said, was take pictures of me. I looked at her a little more closely, remembering the book of Edouard's travels through America. She laughed-- yes, I was that little girl sitting on the couch wearing short shorts. Maybe one day Peter Johnson will be at a party, and he'll be telling somebody, yeah, I was that kid wearing his birthday suit in the "Chop Suey Club." When I got a call from Paris and learned that Edouard Boubat had died, I looked for a self-portrait he had given me a long time ago, where he's wearing a garland in his hair. I also found a photograph he had taken of Leila. I took these photographs to my cabin in the woods and placed them side by side so they could once again spend a summer together. MUSIC - "I AIN'T GOT NOBODY"] -Fran was heavy when she was young, and, uh, she always dressed extremely sharp, you know, to-- I guess to take away from that, and always wore real jewelry. She dressed great. -Well, Jimmy's the one that cut her hair real short. That was about 1950. I cut it all off. This is the week we met, and I had made her a blonde. And she said, you know, when you're pretty, it doesn't matter how you wear your hair. -Oh, Fran loved to have her hair and makeup done. She loved it. -Oh, she lit up. When he'd show up, forget it. -I would make her a platinum, like-- like pillowcase white. -Severe and hot. -Well, she would always say, I'm not a pretty girl, but I'm neat. -And I'm wild. -I'm meticulous and I'm wild. She loved using that-- you're wild, they're wild, so wild. -Bing Crosby, he was sort of a quiet type, you know, but boy, he liked Fran. He really liked her style. -That's way, way back when she first started. She started when she was 15 years old. She entertained them all. -Peter, when I first started taking nude photographs of you, you were always worried about what your grandmother back in Wisconsin was gonna say. That's why I always teased you that we were going to do two versions of the "Chop Suey Club" book-- one for Wisconsin and one for the rest of the world. But after we took a lot of photographs together, I saw through the camera the courage it took for you to let go and trust your own sense of romanticism. I saw it in the way you held hands with your wife and tossed your little daughter up in the air and caught her in a big bear hug. I knew you were at that place where people say you can't do something, but you know you can do anything because the mystery of your whole life lies ahead of you. That's when I decided no, one version for the whole world. -You think that's why Dick Avedon did his father? -I'm sure. -When he was so ill. -I'm sure. It was a way of not mourning in advance but getting close to something that was very painful while it was still possible to connect. -Mm-hmm. Dick always said, "Diana only likes my light side. She doesn't like my dark side." -Artists are like that, Diana. -They want both sides loved. -I grew up in a small farm town, and it was like Christmas time once a month when my mom's coffee of "Vogue" would arrive in the mail. Mrs. Vreeland was then the editor-in-chief of the magazine, and it was her vision of the fast lane that made me want to get out of town. So I made the big move to New York and got my first apartment-- a sixth-floor walk-up on Grand Street. I decorated it like a Hawaiian whorehouse and made the city streets my studio. One night I was walking my golden retriever, Rowdy, down Park Avenue. Along came Mrs. Vreeland, C. Z. Guest, And the famous decorator, Billy Baldwin. They were all dressed in evening clothes. As they caught sight of Rowdy, Mrs. Vreeland and C. Z. fell to their knees on the pavement and announced with joy, that's the blondest dog I've ever seen. After that, Mrs. Vreeland's doorman always tipped his hat to Rowdy when we passed by. Years later, I was on my way to 550 Park Avenue to photograph Dorothy Hammerstein, and I found myself alone in an elevator with Mrs. Vreeland. I was so nervous I was speechless. I suddenly remembered a story told to me from my friend Keisha Keville when she worked in the fashion department at "Vogue." Keisha was staying up all night dancing and coming to work late. Mrs. Vreeland summoned all the young editors around her and said, I and only I have earned the right to die in an opium den in Hong Kong. -It's funny, like, when you look at pictures that are hanging on the wall, you think, like-- like, oh, it's fun to travel with these guys. -Peter Beard gave me this photograph a long time ago. When I first met him, he was sleeping in a car outside of Lexington Labs. -He's the only man I've ever seen in New York in the middle of winter wearing sandals in a suit. -That's Cecil Beaton, who was another photographer who loved to be photographed. -He did everything. He was a stylist, costume designer, photographer, writer-- he was really witty, a very clever, talented guy. -Oh wow. -Man and his trumpet. -Yeah, he would get the whole party swinging. -These are two of my heroes-- Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong by Phil Stern. I always loved the fashion in this photograph. -Did you ever see her live, Bruce? -Yeah, I saw her live. I had to photograph her. And, uh, she was just in a lot of pain, and she was really shy. -Do you know, when you listen to her music, it's like an angel singing. -People like Lee Witkin are saviors for photographers, because you could go into his gallery, and even if you didn't have any money, he would let you look at the photographs and really touch them. I remember the first time I went there, I said, Lee, I want to see these photographs Larry Clark did from "Tulsa." And he opened a box for me. The prints were unspotted and scratched, and I felt the life in them. And I loved that. I love that book, "Tulsa." It's so hard to find. -"Teenage Lust" too. -Incredible book. -It's so raw. It's so-- -Larry Clark gave me this photograph, and on the back of it, he wrote, these two guys are on their way to the pen. Larry came by my studio one day, and all my assistants wanted to meet him. He started showing us all these photographs of kids having sex on a bare cot in an empty room. I said, Larry, how did you meet these guys? And he said, well, I met them down in Times Square, and I told them to come back to this room. And I said, but how did you get them to do this? He said, uh, because I never make fun of anybody. -Puppet, got a light? -Yeah. -Thanks. -Out of all the Allen Ginsberg photographs that I've-- I've seen in your collection, it's like the way he would write on them and-- and record a moment, just as, like, a document for all those writers in that whole period of time and openness. -Yeah. -Yeah. -I love how you-- you take a picture of a person, you catch all the different facets. You hope to, anyway. -Two guys wrestling. Don't they look like basketball players, you know, for the Knicks or the Heat or something? Huh? -I'm just totally so crazy about Mickey Mantle, you know? I mean, he just looks like so many kids from the Midwest I photograph. -You know where Peter used to get all his clothes? -No. -At the airport. -He didn't have time to go shopping. He was too busy going to Africa. -Montgomery Clift was a person I always wanted to meet and I never did. -Yeah, me too. -Look at how young Mick Jagger is. -Unbelievable. -Do you think that's Brian Epstein in the corner over there? -And popples. -It's so rare to see him smiling. -It's almost like he's laughing. -My friend Mark Shand, who's an adventurer and an authority on elephants, called me up one day. If there's one person you should photograph in your life, he said, it's the English explorer Sir Wilfred Thesiger. Sir Wilfred was born in Abyssinia and educated at Oxford, where he was a member of the boxing club. I went to the Explorer's Bookshop in London and found his out-of-print books, "Arabian Sands" and the "Marsh Arabs." Just seeing his picture on the book jacket would have been reason enough to want to photograph him. But after I saw the photographs he took of his Bedouin companions, all I could think of was how to find him. When we finally met, we spent the afternoon drinking tea, talking about camels. Sir Wilfred told me he learned to ride a camel even before he learned to walk. Just before we lost the light, he let me take his portrait. When I told him that he had the profile of a hellbent kid, destined to go his own way, Sir Wilfred reached out and shook my hand. -The Bedu are pretty self-sufficient, but they have to come in every now and again to the towns and villages, and then there's nothing they enjoy so much as a-- watching a dance at the end of the fast of Ramadan or when there's a wedding. But what they really enjoy is when the shakes lay on the camel grates It's camels which dominate the Bedu's life. [speaking foreign language] -I tried to write something that wasn't just a travel book. I wanted to explain, or try to explain, what the desert had meant to the Arab, how it has made them what they are. -After having tea with Sir Wilfred, my admiration for this true gentleman only grew stronger. I thought of the discipline it took to reject the comforts he was born to, choosing instead to spend year after year of hot days and cold nights in the Sahara with only his Bedouin companions, his journal, and his camera. -Other people will go to Arabia, but they'll move about in cars, and they'll keep in touch with the outside world by wireless. They'll bring back, I'm sure, results that are far more interesting than mine, but they will, I believe, never know the spirit of the land or the greatness of the Arab. -Whenever I think of Sir Wilfred, I remember the words of Mabel Dodge-- "He who loves with passion lives on the edge of the desert." desert." How do you describe someone who's like a brother to you and lets you travel around the world and take the photographs you always wanted to? That was Donald Sterzin. His favorite color was blue. He was the first art director who spoiled me. You have to understand that at that time, editors and magazines just didn't feel comfortable focusing on men in photographs. Even today, they'll say, oh, let's just crop the guy out of the picture. But Donald was different. I first met Jeff Aquilon when I was working with Donald for "Gentleman's Quarterly" magazine. Jeff was captain of the water polo team at Pepperdine University. On the day we met him at a casting, he had a Band-Aid over his nose from a recent game and no money for gas. From the very first moment, Donald begin planning how to get Jeff on the cover, and he did. On the day Jeff made the cover of "GQ," he sent Donald a thank-you note with a handmade drawing of a California sunset. Donald teased Jeff endlessly about that drawing, but he never threw it away. There wasn't a sport Jeff couldn't play perfectly. Donald never tired of watching him do cannonball dives into the swimming pool at George Cukor's house in Hollywood. But there was this other connection between Jeff and Donald-- their minds were so alike. They could debate for hours over how to repair a lawn mower, and they both really cared what the current population was in Spokane, Washington. When Jeff first got married in Boston, half the pews in the church were filled with proper Bostonians, and the other half were filled with hairdressers, makeup artists, designers, and models. When the minister asked if anyone there wanted to speak now or forever hold his peace, all the fashion people started laughing and turned to Donald. Donald looked up at minister and said, why the hell is everybody looking at me? Donald and I had great times going to flea markets and looking for old canoes. He bought a beautiful Old Town canoe, painted cornflower blue and kept it up at our camp in the Adirondacks. He loved to take friends out on the lake for rides in the moonlight. He taught Nan and me that there was an art to gliding through the still water. On summer days, we'd take trips to our favorite pond, our canoes filled with friends and dogs. Most of the time, the dogs would tip the canoe over, and they'd have to fetch my cameras from the water. Those days became a book called "Bear Pond." I dedicated it to Donald. By then he was becoming very ill, and all his friends were taking care of him instead of him taking care of us. When he died, we made a blue patch for the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the color of his Old Town canoe. It read nothing gold can stay. For many years after Donald died, I continued to photograph Jeff and his three kids. One night, Nan and I were sitting with Jeff in a bar. He was all tanned, wearing an old water polo T-shirt, reminding me so much of those early days. I can still see Donald looking at Jeff and saying, I can't believe my eyes. Through the years, my photographs of Jeff had always been that picture inside Donald's head. But I realized what Donald had tried to teach me was to take the pictures that I desire. Nan proposed a toast to Donald. I turned to Jeff and said, no one ever loved you more. -This is her 10th visit to Australia. We recently saw her, by the way, in another dimension-- which I want to talk to her about in just a minute. In a major movie role, she played a madam of a whatchamacallit house in New Orleans in the film, "Pretty Baby." I never expected that I was going to see in a million years Francis Faye playing a madam of a house of ill repute. -Well, I did it-- that was an acting role. -Yes. -You better believe that. -Good God, you're in the wrong place, Monsieur. We're not in the business of buying. -Madam, perhaps you know my name. I have photographed in the district many times. -Photographs? What the hell kind of thing is that? -We're gonna do it one more time like Count Basie. Go. -We were working at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas. We had gone into rehearsal, and the band was a nervous wreck in Vegas. So we had to pull that whole rehearsal over, and she was exhausted. So we came up to get ready for the show that night. She came upstairs to relax and tripped, and she cracked her hip. She had to go into the hospital for an X-ray. Then she had to have three surgeries. She was working in pain all the time. It took six months to get her back onstage. And we had to take her back onstage in blackout and, uh, do that whole show in a wheelchair. But she still did her show. And that was the only time that she was free and forgot about the pain, was when she was working. -Yes! -She had so much sickness through her life then. You know how Liz Taylor had just had one thing after the other? In '84, Fran would get the first stroke, a blood clot in the arm. That frightened her to death. -She had a speech therapist, and she worked with getting her speech back. -A lot of people would have given up. -Oh, yeah. -She kept going. -Even when she was sick, you know, and practically dying, she never lost her sense of humor. -When you've got a body and a face like yours, why should you worry about any-- -Of course. When you're pretty, it doesn't matter how you look. -I agree with you. -Right? -At the end, she couldn't say much but fuck. She could always-- I don't know why, but she would try to speak, and it wouldn't come out. and she'd always go, aw, fuck. That was perfect-- perfectly clear. [applause] -I love you. I love you. -When I first started working as a photographer, I would look at the German magazine "Twen" all the time. It was always filled with pictures of tan, young, nude girls. Sometimes they would have cameras around their necks and they'd be frolicking in the Seychelles, or some other exotic location. The photographers, who were really their boyfriends, were handsome hippies from London or Paris. I loved their swinging scene. When Alfred Stieglitz was asked to photograph a friend's wife in the same way he photographed his own wife, Georgia O'Keeffe, he replied, if you knew what I have to feel to get those photographs, you wouldn't ask me that. It's too dangerous. That's why you need your head examined to be in love with a photographer-- because when you're taking pictures, you can be as fascinated with an elephant who body-surfs on the ocean or with an 85-year-old explorer, whose nose is like a Giacometti sculpture as with a young wrestler from Wisconsin who looks like a drawing of a schoolboy from Eton. Sometimes the idea of a person or thing makes you want, in an instant, to follow them on a plane to Tahiti or just on a bus to Poughkeepsie. If you collide with someone or something that powerful in this orbit of ours, as long as you have a heartbeat, you've got to be able to follow where that leads. That's how you know you can still pick up a camera. I remember the image in a photograph of Henry Miller, his '70s, at his house in Big Sur. He's all dressed up for a date, and he's playing ping pong with a voluptuous new girl. She's probably an aspiring writer who just came by to meet him, but he didn't need his youth as an excuse to play a great game of ping pong. When we were on the set, the costume designer William Ivey Long, who apprenticed with Charles James, was dressing the cast. He handed me these gold stars and said, just paste them anywhere on Peter. I looked at Peter's face and his shoulders, his arms and legs, and my hand just went like a magnet and placed a star right on his heart. -Mm-mm! That's the way everybody should dress. I've always felt the spontaneity and to hell with them, whether they like it or not, you know? And then one day I went to a Russian school, and then I was happy. And that's the only school I was ever happy in, because all I did was dance. -Beautiful memories-- you see, that's the thing. When Fran passed away, I felt like I lost my best friend, and I had the pictures and the music and all that and that-- you gotta have that. You gotta have that. But the music just carries me on. It-- uh, it's like-- almost like she's right there. -When I think of Teri and Fran, I see them out on that beautiful terrace. They really enjoyed that house and big fat joints rolled for everybody and staring at the view, and it was like, fuck the rest of the world. How much better could this be? That was-- that was kind of the way it was. -I have this book-- you know, Fran with all her write-ups and stuff. I'm gonna bring it, and I'll show Peter what he has to do with all his stuff. People go, oh, there's a write-up. OK, OK, OK, and then, you know, you throw it away. But later, you're gonna love that-- especially your daughter. -Just stash it. -Just stack them up. You can always do that later. -She might want to do that. When's her birthday? -Her birthday is November 4. -That's Fran's birthday-- November 4. That's amazing. Oh, she's going to be wild. She's going to be wild. -That's great. -Yeah, and she's a Scorpio, so she'll go her own way. -She'll become a nightclub singer too. -November 4. -Oh, that's great. -I've had a great time playing with monkeys or climbing palm trees or riding on elephants. I wouldn't give it back for anything. It's a treasure. -It's fun to imagine Peter Johnson at 70, watching his grandchildren playing baseball in his backyard and then finding a dust-covered copy of "The Chop Suey Club," a record of his journey and of ours, tucked away on a shelf among his old yearbooks and wrestling trophies. On the day we finish shooting the film, I went off to another room with Peter, just the two of us, to take one last photograph of him. The sarong he was wearing was falling off as he looked to the camera, and we both just laughed. For me, taking photographs is like a childhood dream of running away and joining the big top. Years ago, William Saroyan wrote, "The circus was everything. Everything else we knew wasn't. It was adventure, travel, danger, skill, grace, romance, comedy, peanuts and popcorn. You get to travel with lion tamers, acrobats, and fortune tellers. You're always pitching your tent in a new town, and you never know who you're going to meet next up on the flying trapeze." trapeze." -Hey there, homies and homettes. A rainbow. Rainbow. And do you have a rainbow inside your heart and your mind and your soul? [music - "chop suey"] [music - "chop suey"] -I was gonna strip, but I'm not feeling too well. I'm not pretty, but I'm very wild. And if you ever saw me during the day in a black sheet and sneakers, you'd kill yourself. I'm not pretty, but I'm neat. You can eat off me, I'm so neat. I really am. Shall I strip or should I sing? [applause] -Oh, I'd rather strip. I think it's such a ball. Everybody, let me hear it. Just say yeah one time. -Yeah. -One more time, like I like it. -Yeah! -You gotta scream and go crazy. And let me-- and let me-- let's make it dark, just in case a tall fellow walks in and sees me and flips. You never know. I wish I had a younger band, because I think it's so important towards the weekend, you know? I want to dedicate my next song to our headwaiter, who's been trying to make me since I opened here, and he's such an old back. I think when you're pretty it does matter how you wear your hair. (SINGING) Bye bye. Thank you. Bye bye bye bye bye. God bless. Love you. Thank you. What a ball. I gotta go. I hate to go. But I gotta go. I gotta mix. Scooby-dooby-doo. Rats in my room. I'm going crazy by those rats in my room. My favorite song of all songs that I'm about to record-- (SINGING) Rio Rita! Does that sound too camp? Bye! [applause]
