We were 12 going on 13, the last year before we became teenagers. Thick as thieves, they called us. The only thing stolen that summer was my heart. Come on, guys. I got to get back soon or my mum's gonna kill me. He's not wrong. Jason's mum was something sinister. She's the original Karen. If she were a horror movie, she'd be "Karen: Origins." Sometimes I think we all harken back to the days of... Holy shit! A dead body! ♪♪ Holy shit. A gun. - Was that his? - What? Shit, no. This is my dad's. He brought it back from Desert Storm. Shot Saddam in the face with it. Now he's got one of his lookalikes pretending to be him. Uh, thank you, Ellie's dad, for his service, I think. And... And why have you got it? Because it's cool. Guys, I have an idea. ♪♪ - How do we know this even works? - Well, it worked on telly. He looks like he's seen better days. He has. But life finds a way. Yeah. Are we sure this is, like, a good idea or... Was climbing Mount Everest a bad idea, Jason? For some people? Look, when are we ever gonna find another real-life dead guy? In a couple hours if Jason's not home for dinner. Jason will be fine. Let's bring this dude back to life. Yeah. How long is it supposed to take? - Everything okay down there? - Yeah! Does anybody want a drink? We've got OJ, soda, purple stuff, Sunny Delight. -Ooh. Ooh. I love SunnyD. It's got solar energy. -No, thanks, Stat's mum. We're fine. Okay, then. You kids have fun. I'll just be shutting the door now and soundproofing it for no reason. ♪♪ ♪♪ Ugh. Okay, maybe this time, we don't shoot him in the face right away. Sorry. I'm not a trained killer like my dad. I want to go home. It's gonna be okay, mate. I promise we'll get you there real soon. Holy shit. -Uh, hello, mate. Sorry, I didn't catch your name. I'm Cooper. Can you say that? Cooper? Stop murdering me. ♪♪ ♪♪ That's my girlfriend, you dead prick. Labels. Time to die. Again. No. Time to die. Motherfucker! - Hey, now. Language. - Huh? I tell you, I open the soundproof door for 5 seconds to offer you snacks, and I hear you swearing. You don't talk to people that way, do you? - No, Stat's mum. - Excuse me. No, Stat's mum. -Now, that's more like it. Hey, Jason. Your mom called, hon. Dinner will be ready at seven. Best not to be late. And who shoes are these? You better not be trying to reanimate a homeless man's corpse again. - Of course not, Mum. - Don't make me come down there. ♪♪ That's for Jason. ♪♪ Holy shit. A sword. -Right? Some weird shit down here. Are we sure this is a good idea? Oh, yeah, 100%. Then you should shoot him in the face right away again. Are you seriously gonna make me apologize for murdering you when you were already dead? Oh, right. Hey, at least his speech is getting better. You're the one who wants to do this to Jason. I mean, it turned this guy into a complete A-hole. No. Shooting me in the face turned me into an A-hole. Also, I was always an A-hole. I'm more worried about Jason's mum being an A-hole if he's not home by seven. True, but, like... -We'll get him a scarf. She won't even notice. But I'llnotice. And what does that even mean? Are you doing one-liners? I'm playing on the notion that my idea of fashion is more important than his parents finding out that we killed him. You know, for a dead bloke with a hole in his neck, you never shut up. - Guys, we got to get going. -Come on, Jason. We need to you back, mate. So, turns out 12 year olds aren't very good at this whole reanimating-a-corpse science. After multiple attempts, we quickly learned that we probably just made things worse. ♪♪ -What do we do now? It's almost seven. Tabby has a calming effect on him, at least. We're gonna need a bigger scarf. It's a transporter! ♪♪ Whatever you put in here comes out reassembled on the other side. - That will never work. - Shut up! All right! ♪♪ This better work. ♪♪ Is it supposed to make that... Guys, where's Tabby? Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him. We humbly pray. Amen. Amen. Nice of you to join us, Jason. Jesus fucking Christ! Holy shit! Holy shit! We're so dead. It took some time to adjust, but with eight lives left, Jason would go on to live a full, if unconventional, life. That sweltering summer day in 1993 quickly became one I'll never forget. And although I hadn't seen Whiskers in more than 10 years, I know I'll miss him forever. I never had any friends like the ones I had when I was 12. Shit, does anyone? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Fuck. Jesus. This thing is so fucking hot. You have no idea. - This fucking guy. You guys think you have it bad? Try getting in this fucking thing. I'm talking 100 degrees of indoor not A/C. Hell, you'll thank me. And besides, you already knew it was me the whole time, right? So anyways, the game and shit. Yes. You all have bombs attached to your necks. You have to figure out which four movies inspired what you just watched within 90 seconds or your fucking heads will explode. Cool? Cool. Activated. What... What did he mean, inspired by movies? Uh, "Stand By Me." - All right. - Oh, no, no, no. I mean, um, it's inspired by "Stand by Me." There's kids and a dead body and... and narration. - Oh. - So "Stand By Me"... - The movie. - Is probably one of them. - Yeah. That's okay. - Sorry. -There was another one. The... "The Thing." "The Thing." 'Cause they're doing the experiments in the lab and they bring back to life a cat or a dog. - I don't think that's it. - No, no, that's not it. It's not... It's not "The thing." They were riffing on "Pet Sematary." How could you not see that? Okay, we don't need gatekeeping here. We know what we know, and we love what we love. No one's an expert. - We don't have time for this. What the fuck now, Sam? This is so much better. And to be totally honest with y'all, I'm getting kind of bored, and I really fucking hate you. So I can't wait to see you all dead. Why don't you roll on out here, then? Oh, classic Jessie, always trying to be the hero. I have a better idea.

Hey, but there was a talking head. We need to find it. - "American Beauty." - I don't think that's it. There were experiments and there was a cat. - Kevin Spacey has ruined it! - And there was green goo. Oh, God. That door over there is wide open. I can't leave her. I'm fully in the belief that Jessie can save all of us. I mean, have you seen the shit she was doing over there? -Just stop. Stop. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's pointless.

The "Friday the 13th" one with Corey Feldman. - "The Lost Boys" dude? - No, that's Corey Haim. Hey, Damon, don't you remember me? So ungrateful. - I don't get it. - Baby, I don't... So unworthy.

My troubled life finally had purpose with the one man who understood me and the rules of horror. -Kimmie, I don't understand. We've been together since... How'd you like to play a game?
