MISS JULIA CELEBRATES Martin, come here! Have you gone completely mad? Yes... No! This is not a circus. Just do your job! Rest assured... I certainly shall! I do my job... with pleasure! What you do it WITH, doesn't matter. Just DO IT! That pathetic... - Did you say something? - Not a word. I'll talk to the manager about you! Yep! You damned pipsqueak! Bumbler! Clodhopper Good morning! Hope you're all fit and well on the last workday of the year! - Good morning, Martin! - Good morning. CASHIER Martin, you know I don't want you to clean my pencils! Here I am trying to make everything as nice as possible... No gratitude at all! Don't get me wrong Martin... I appreciate what you do. How about you water our pot-plants? Yeah! Julia... I'm thinking about something. Can you guess what it is? Yes. An advance. Yes! Do you think I might get a small advance? It's just because of my poverty-stricken children. "Your poverty-stricken children..." You've been living off them for years. But you don't have any! This is December and you've been paid up to next April. April, yes... But I've already got springtime feelings! You're not thinking of proposing to me on New Years Eve... like you have for the last 20 years? Promise me that! Hello? Yes, he's here. Accountant Pettersson wants to speak to you. "Well Mr Pettersson, it was like this..." Come in! Good morning... yes? Tell Miss Ahlbom I want to talk to her. I shall talk with Miss Ahlbom No, it's ME who wants to talk with Miss Ahlbom. Yes, I mean its ME who'll talk with her... no! Just hurry up! Greta, the accountant wants to talk to you. With me? Strange. What's it about? I've no idea. Greta... It's not strange if he wants to talk to you... But if he invites you to the movies... That could be rather strange, if you know what I mean. Oh, Martin! You wanted to talk to me, Sir? Yes... I need to dictate a letter. We can leave that for now. I have a couple of cinema tickets for this evening. Would you like to join me? That's very nice of you, but I can't. Can't? Why not? Do you have a fiance? No I'm not, but... No? So what's the "but"? Yes, I'll come right away. I hope you don't have any "buts" next time. Good morning, Sir. There's a matter that I want to discuss with you. We've paid 5,112 kronor to Gustaf Hansson Pty Ltd. They received 112 kronor. Then it get's strange. They say we only owed them 112 kronor. How is that explained? Where did the 5,000 get to? There must be a mistake. It's not about a mistake, it's about fraud! And there are only two people who could be suspected. One is myself. The other, Miss Lundkvist. So it has to be Miss Lundkvist! No, I really don't think so. You're not saying it's ME??! Of course not, Sir, out of the question. I meant it can't be Miss Lundquist, either. But Miss Lundkvist has been here for decades. She celebrates 25 years on January 1st. In 4 days time. Yes, but she's the one who paid out the money! Wouldn't it be best to report it to the police? No, I don't think you should do that, Sir. That could harm the firm's good name. With regards to Miss Lundkvist's involvement... I think we need to keep it under wraps. Aren't you having lunch, Miss Lundkvist? Goodness, I'd forgotten all about it! I just have so much to do! Is that the time? There'll be nothing left for me. I've fixed it for you. Greta, you're a sweetheart! Here we are... milk and coffee. Thank you Greta, my pet... You always look after me! But what could this be? A New Year present. A New Year's present, for me?! You shouldn't have! Yes I should. Oh, they're lovely! Warm and attractive. They're just what I want! 42! That's my size exactly! They're from my heart. And go to my feet! Julia, the boss wants to see you right away! Bring your account book with you! A person can't even enjoy a quiet lunch! Now we must keep an open mind. She shouldn't notice anything.. That's right, keep an open mind! How much have we paid to Gustav Hansson Pty Ltd? Hansson? Just a moment... Here we are... Hansson. 5,112 kronor and 25 ore. Bring me a copy of the payment advice and the voucher. That's impossible today. Impossible? What do you mean? We've had a lot to do. It's after 2 o'clock, and I still haven't had lunch. I'm sorry! So when can I get it? Next year, Sir. I mean January 3. Is it really so hard to fetch them? Could you eat lunch and fetch a letter at the same time? I wish you'd... You can just wish me a happy New Year! As far as payments are concerned, I'm the only one responsible. After New Year I'll show you all the paperwork. In the meantime I wish you a happy holiday! I've never heard the likes of it! Men are so bull-headed! Enough to turn you into a vegetarian! The exception proves the rule: Martin. Martin's not a man! You say I'm not a man? How would you know? How can you say that? I didn't mean it like that... You're a genius! I am, am I? What do you have in that package? This is my food. What is it you're eating? Excuse me... This is he-man's food. Fitness-freaks eat this sort of thing. It consists of wheat bran, raisins, kale, carrot, parsnip and the like. Yes, raw veges are very wholesome! That's what I mean. And so easy to prepare! Greta, what are you doing with yourself tomorrow? New Years Eve? I'll probably lie down with a book. What about your mum and dad? I don't have any parents. Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'll go heat up the coffee. You and I have to get our heads together! Julia, dear, I've wanted to do that all this year! No, I just mean that I want to do something for Greta. Could I give her a dress? Dress? Nuts! What do you think a young girl dreams about? Not what you and I could give her. Meaning? A guy! - Really? - Yes. A young man with a good job that she can marry and make a home with. You're right there, Martin. - Nothing we can do. - No, we can't. I like her so much. I could have had a daughter Ike her... ...if ever I'd married. You said it! It's your own fault. You didn't want me when I proposed 20 years ago. ... The first time. - No, I didn't want to. Then I had my life ahead of me. Exciting... Instead, I've sat in an office for 25 years... and become lonely and old... Older. I've also become lonely and old... Older. That's life. But, Julia... At least we've been friends all this time. Of course we have. But it's not enough. Sooner or later every woman comes to regret not having a home, husband and children. Martin, we shall get Greta married! Whatever you say, goes! I have a brilliant idea! I'm inviting the two of you to the mountains over New Year. What do you mean? That requires three things... Which are? Money, money... and money! I have money, Martin. What do you mean? You haven't been tickling the till? Quiet! You can't joke about that sort of thing! How shall we arrange it? I know, I'll ring a travel agent! Leave it to me! Greta, There's a small matter I'd like to talk to you about. - Is something wrong? - No, not at all. Would you like to come to the mountains with Martin and me over New Year? That'd be such fun! Yes! But I don't have any ski clothes or... Don't worry, you and I will go buy them! I couldn't accept that. Of course you can! For two years you've been so good helping me. At least I can make you happy for a couple of days! All arranged! Greta, we are going to have the best New Years Eve ever! And I shall, too! To a mountain far away We travel for some winter's play All of us as, we chug along sing the steam-train song As fast, as fast, as fast as ever you dare... The hotter the fire, the sooner we'll be there! Fast, fast, faster, throw a lot more coal... Clear the tracks, here we come, the mountain is our goal... Not to Dalom, no... We're off to a Norrland run There we'll slalom, so, for round-the-clock snow fun. - Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast! - Won't we soon be there? Speed up much much faster... if you dare! In the mountain valleys steep where all the drifts lie deep That's where, I do think, we shall most likely sink! As fast, as fast, as fast as ever you dare... The hotter the fire, the sooner we'll be there! Fast, fast, faster, throw a lot more coal... Clear the tracks, here we come, the mountain is our goal... Not to Dalom, no... We're off to a Norrland run There we'll slalom, so, for round-the-clock snow fun. - Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast! - Won't we soon be there? Speed up much much faster... if you dare! Martin, was that you? No, I didn't do anything. I hope so. You're too old for that sort of thing. Now we'll see what's attainable. Open-hearted and nice. Chic, charming! That ankle! That look! "Not a single flower on this frozen field!" Farewell beautiful dreams! What the hell are we going to do here? Well... We could possibly go skiing. Yeah... Could do that. Maybe. And then we could... Not bad! Boy, just my cup of tea! Sure is. Just one moment, gentlemen. Might you be interested in a little fashion news, Miss? No thanks. Look at this... 24 down... "Feelings" 8 letters. Can that be sympathy? Macke, got the brush-off, the brush-off, Macke, got the brush-off, the big brush-off! I picked it right away... Type 3. Very susceptible to good taste and culture. Excuse me, Miss, the lady left these on the train. I don't remember that. Maybe they were hers. With my compliments! Oh, how nice! What a charming boy! That was so sweet of you! Aake got the brush-off, the brush-off, Aake got the brush-off, the big brush-off! Wrong tactics my friends... You gotta have a bit of charm! Greta, now I've found the best ski instructor here! Really?! He'll call in half an hour. His name's Torstein Guttormsen. He's Norwegian? Would you mind moving? Have you lost something? Erik got the brush-off, the brush-off... What are you laughing at? Because I'm happy. Why are you happy? I'm happy... because I'm happy! What do you mean by that? I mean I'm happy, therefore I'm HAPPY! But why were you happy to start with?? I'm terribly happy... and I'm happy about that fact. Yes, I can understand that. You are happy about being happy. Yes. So I'm asking why you're happy in the first place... At the beginning. Because I'm happy! So that's the reason! This looks really nice, Greta! The next one... This also looks nice. - Julia... - Yes? Tell them here at the hotel that Greta is your niece. Why should I do that? Well, it gives a better outward appearance. Yes, maybe it does! Question the porter as to who's staying at the hotel. You know what I mean. Porter, can I have a word with you? In here! - Please sit down! - Absolutely not! Just do as I say! The thing is that I have a young relative... Actually a girl... ...who I'm trying to marry off. Is there no one else? Some of the gentlemen in 77. Who are they? Classy types! They're 2 brothers, They're scientists. Hallberg is their name. Very respectable. Wait a minute...! Yes! Hello? Who? You're the Norwegian ski instructor? Yes, I'll come right away. Hi, are you the ski instructor? I want 5 hours today and 5 tomorrow. 5 hours! Isn't that a bit much? No, I don't think so. Monte Carlo... How far is it to there? Exactly 2740 km, approximately. Very kind of you, thank you. Norwegian ski instructor! Norwegian ancestry is useful sometimes. Lucky bastard! Imagine being that good! Everyone was a beginner once. It can't be too hard to learn. I'm not afraid. You're not? Just try this little hill. Come on! Help me! No, it's important you get up by yourself. That's the best way to learn. Now you're making fun of me! Don't talk so much! No, put it there. Take the sticks and get on the slope! I can't do any more! I thought you wanted to have 5 hours. Gosh it's cold. And I'm starving! I have some chocolate in my rucksack. There you are! Your binding's not right. Darling, I haven't heard from you for a whole week. Are you having such a good time with your lady pupils? You naughty naughty heart-breaker. 1000 kisses Kickan So your bindings are fixed! Are you always so nice to your pupils? Ski instructors are paid to be nice. What does Kickan think about that? Kickan? Yes. You shouldn't leave your love letters lying around. That's my sister. Your sister? Well, it doesn't matter. Shall we ski down this little slope? No, I don't dare. Yes you do. Come on! No, stop! I want to get off! All right. You did that on purpose! No, I did not! Did! Didn't! That was on purpose. Look! It's really nice all around here. It's nicest on this side. There's Fjallgarden, and over there... Over there! That's called Mullfjallet. Famous for its beauty, as they say. I was here in 1931 when I was together with Margit. Your skis! Hey, come back! Come back here! Do you remember when we went skating at Nybroviken? That was something! I did an 8 which looked like a 3...! ...but got first prize. I knew someone who did a that looked like an 8. He got 6 months. You haven't forgotten how to skate, have you? Forgotten? How could I forget? I have an amazing memory! The shiny mirror of the ice makes me want to figure-eight Deep inside my breast I feel that skating is my fate If I were a skating princess, right now I'd tour the land As proud as the swan, Vivi-Anne I'd have it in the palm of my hand You and I upon the ice is the best you can evince - If I were a skating princess - And I were a skating prince! To spin around on bladed feet just like in your youth I feel as though I'm seventeen, and that's the honest truth If I were a skating princess, right now I'd tour the land As proud as the swan, Vivi-Anne, I'd have it in the palm of my hand You and I upon the ice is the best you can evince - If I were a skating princess - And I were a skating prince! - How much? - Enough to satisfy... ...a couple in need. We'll travel tomorrow. Julia! Julia! I got hold of him! Who? The one that Greta is going to be hitched up to,, and who will accompany her through life! Hallberg is his name... and he's staying in the most expensive room with his brother.! There they are, sitting over there! The both of them look good! I think they'd make a good match, both of them. The main thing is that he be of good character. You'll soon find out! The thing is now to make their acquaintance. How do we? It's very easy. Here they are, sitting there. You walk past. You have to move gracefully. You glance down.... and drop your handkerchief That's all there is to it! Martin, where do you get all this from? But I can't carry all this money with me. I'll leave it with the porter. Can I leave some money here? No, the manager isn't here. He'll be back shortly. I'll just have to be careful. Here she comes. Hello Countess! Sorry, I thought you were Countess Hagerclou. Forgive me! Pleased to meet you!! Likewise. Hallberg. Lundquist.... Miss. Let me introduce my brother... Dr Hallberg. Would you allow me to invite you to a party tonight? - You're too kind. - Not at all! There's an ulterior motive... I'd very much like you to meet my niece. Thank you very much, we'd be delighted. Thank you very much. Martin, what a strategist you are! Quite a guy! Who? You. I'm so proud of you! You embarrass me! What about the way you pulled it off! So diplomatic, showing great... I don't know what! I'm proud of you, Julia! And... Greta! Quite an ordeal! What time tomorrow? How about 8 o'clock? The ski instructors celebrate New Year in the annexe. And I believe, give lessons on theory at the same time? Exactly! Do you promise to come? Maybe. Julia! Everything is ruined! She's fallen in love! - Who? - Greta! What? She's fallen in love with the ski instructor. Not good... He's a lady-killer, a con-man! I found out about him. Con-man eh? We'll put a stop to that! Hey, Guttormsen! Thanks for the loan. You should hide your love letters better! It's from Kickan. Where can I find the Norwegian ski instructor? - Back there. - Thanks. You're the Norwegian ski instructor? That's me. I've got to give you a piece of my mind! - You have, have you? - Yes, I have. Your job is just to teach skiing... Nothing else, and don't forget it... You Casanova! Guys like you are a menace. How much do I owe you... ...all inclusive? Be so good as to buzz off! Guests are not supposed to be in here! I just wanted to tell you... I'll report you to management! Is Miss Lundquist staying here? That's right. Miss Julia Lundkvist? Yes, in room 10. You guessed correctly, Sherlock Svensson! Come in! Oh Julia, aren't you ready yet? You're making me nervous! What on earth...? Just look at you! Don't you think it's nice? It suits me?? Your cravat's all askew! What about your beads, then? My pearls, you mean! Now it's all got to be about Greta's happiness. Yes? - Can we come in? - Sure! - What do you think? - You're like a fairy! Full marks Greta! Looks great... Your whole future could depend on today. - There are these two... - Quiet, Martin! We're having supper with two young scientists. Two smart-looking guys. Globetrotters! Did you say two smart-looking guys? In that case there must be more smart-looking guys! Yes, but we're not talking about you, now! - Oh, madame! - Monsieur! See you soon, Greta. Waiter! We'll have five of the 6-kronor suppers. No, make it the 4-kronor ones. It looks really nice. But Julia, they're high-class people, aren't they? You're right... we'll take the 6-kronor ones. What brand of champagne would you prefer? Champagne?! No, a small glass of wine for the ladies... and the men can have a beer each. Julia... Well, we'll have a bottle of champagne. Here are the gentlemen! Professor Hallberg. Dr Hallberg. Miss Ahlbom. Mr Lagerberg. Thank you so much for the invitation. Please sit down, gentlemen. - That's a great hat! - So is yours! There they are, boss, sitting over there. Could I have the next dance, Miss? Thanks. I've been waiting for this for a long time. How sweet! They could be made for each other. There must be others? Shall we drink to that? Why not? Cheers! Would you like to dance? Love to! She'll want to sink out of sight when she sees us. Hello there, Boss! Happy New Year! Outrageous! Come on! Shouldn't we have something to eat? No thanks. I'm no longer hungry. The heel broke. - Look! - What a shame! Wait here and I'll get my other shoes. Shouldn't I come with you? No thanks, I'll be alright! Where's the annex restaurant? To the right and straight ahead. Have you seen that lonely laddie? Yes. He's waiting for his student. But that's pretty silly. She's having lessons elsewhere. Yes, I believe he's very good at teaching dancing and flirting and the social whirl! And he's a gentleman, to boot. A nice change for the girl. Erik got the brush-off, the brush-off, Erik got the brush-off, the big-brush-off! You're both looking so nice. Nice, and clean! Good evening! Here I am! Good evening. Glad to see you! Who are these characters? Things got a bit too hot for them. Don't let us hold you up. They're leaving. Leaving? Where can we go? Go up to the main restaurant and have a dance. No, it's nicer here. Yes, a lot nicer. We're staying. Mr Jansson and Mr Hansson... Miss Ahlbom. They're two old friends of mine... You have old friends in Sweden?! So it's a dubious existence. In as much as he's not very gifted... What's up? Somebody kicked me! Look, this is a new trick! You just take a regular cigarette. You light a regular match and you inhale the smoke... I know something funnier. You sit opposite each other with your eyes blindfolded... ...and try to find each other's fingertips. That's ridiculously easy! If you can do it, you get 10 kronor each. Are you sure you can't see anything? We'll start to count... One... two... three... Can I pay? - How much? - 15 kronor. You have a lot of money! I have a friend who is... ...out on a bear-hunt. It's dangerous... ...so I'm minding it for him. What's his name? Kruse... Erik Kruse. Erik Kruse. He's secretary to the Norwegian legation in Stockholm. Don't look so doubtful! There's a sleigh outside. A sleigh?! Waiting to take us for a ride! ...eighteen, nineteen, twenty! Snow and ice a thousand-fold, canopied by trees Although the glass is way below, with you I never freeze We are going on a sleigh adventure, the road ahead is free Over lake and countryside, through the night with thee Listen to the song of our journey, yours and my refrain... Listen in the icy cold until the sun shines once again The crust reflects the starlight, the forest's clad in snow The heavens twinkle and I've a friend that I like ever so We are going on a sleigh adventure, the road ahead is free No cars disturb the romantic sound of jingle bells with thee. Where has Greta got to? See if someone knows. Julia, I need to talk to you! I realise you'd like me gone, so you can be alone with that... You know what I mean. Don't be silly! I'm leaving now and I won't come back! Sorry to leave you. I'm sure the young lady will be back. Ladies and gentlemen... Take your leave of the old year! In one minute it will be 12 o'clock! I'd like to wish you a happy new year! And to you, Professor... Happy New Year! I'm sorry, but we have to leave you now. Already?! We have to be away in the morning on the first train. Good night, and thank you so much for this evening! - What's that? - Your bill. That much? Have you lost something, Ma'am? My wallet with all my money is gone! Wait a moment! I thought I was seeing double! Martin, I have to talk to you! It's serious, Martin! I must talk to you! I'll show you something funny... These little frogs... Please...! Martin! Martin, listen to me! All the money is gone! Gone...? So am I! Gone? Martin, listen to me! I've lost all my money! Where? If I knew that I wouldn't have to look for it! Dearest, sweetest, Martin, will you listen to me! - Thanks for this evening. - It's for me to thank YOU. It's gone! But Julia, what is gone is gone! I have the serial numbers of the notes... Can't you pay the bill with that? None of your dumb jokes now! What's happened? My 500 kronor are gone! Could some one have stolen them? That's possible! Who have you been with? Together with me! Let me gather my thoughts! Hallbergs... It couldn't be them. I had my wallet with the ski instructor! The ski instructor? Martin! Where's your head? Martin, wake up! Wake up, Martin! Wake up! I can't wake up, if I'm awake! I can't understand how you can be in such a good mood. Hello? The manager? We'll come right away. The manager wants to talk to us. That's wonderful... He can lend us some money! You go ahead... I'll just make myself decent. Good morning, Sir! Miss Lundkvist will be here in a moment. So, are you also staying at the hotel? Yes I am... I'm here. I should say... I'm here as Miss Lunkvist's guest. Now I see things very clearly. Martin... Hello, Sir. Are you also Miss Lundkvist's guest? Yes. It's been so nice here. Good morning, Sir! So good of you to want to see me. I need to talk to you in private. What a coincidence! I have something to talk about with you, too. We'll go into the writing-room. Miss Lundkvist... You're staying at one of our most exclusive hotels... on top of which you have two guests, right? Isn't it wonderful to Ba able to do something for those you like? But can you afford such extravagances? Can you do it with what you're paid? I wonder myself, sometimes. But I don't drink and I don't smoke, and I've saved. I do not doubt it for a moment. But I must ask you for the cash-box key. You can't be serious? Surely you're joking? I've never been more serious. I'll tell you why. I no longer have the same trust in you, Miss Lundkvist. After 25 years... No! No! Even if you don't trust me. Nobody else has access, if I'm not there. Not even you, Sir! You won't give me the keys? Why? "Why", you ask? I no longer have the same trust in you, Sir. The insolence! And you can say that to my face?! So you can understand. We can discuss this later. Yes, there will be more to say later. Come on! How did it go? What about the money? Didn't work out! Admit, right now, that you lied to me! Well? Admit it! That you stole 500 kronor! Don't deny it! I see you've got it! One, two, three, four, five. Thank you, Mr Ski-instructor! After 25 years! How could anyone suspect... Here's your money. Where did you get that from? Don't ask. It doesn't matter. The main thing is that you got it back. Well done! So, Julia... we pay the bill... and take the next train home, so you can go through the accounts! That's what you need to do! Hello, desk...? When does the next train leave for the south? It leaves in 10 minutes! The bill please! And we need a car, to catch the train! Quite impossible. But we must have a car... can we get one or not? Firstly there are no cars here at the moment, You've no car? And the train leaves in 5 minutes. You wouldn't make it, anyway. We'll make it! Julia! Hurry up, or we won't make it! Put skis on... We must make that train! How will this work? Seeing as I've never skied. Stop blabbering... We have to get moving! Julia, look out! You'll need to turn! Greta, Julia is down on her knees! Help her up! It's not so hard! She's upside down! You should have seen as soon as they got away. Just disappeared! Here's the ski instructor. You can teach me some hot ski-moves. - Have you seen her? - Greta? Sure did! She raced off to catch the train. She couldn't stand you. Not in the long run. Don't laugh! She was just in my room, and stole 500 kronor. Yeah... 300 of it was yours! Put the light on! This has to be sorted out as quickly as possible. Before sunrise! What's up with you? I'm just so tired. Go down and lie down on the couch in the showroom. Gustafsson. Gustafsson. Hansson... Can I help you? I need to do this myself. Hey! I've got an idea! Keep it to yourself! Hansson... Martin! Look at this. What is it? This verification has been changed! Look at that "5"! It looks a bit crooked. What did I tell you?! What did I tell you?! Now I understand! Someone who knows the safe-deposit box cipher. He's changed the verification and taken the money. If it's discovered... ...I'm the one who's suspected. Don't look at me... I didn't do it! Don't be silly. Who could have done it? We must find out. Otherwise I'll be blamed. Julia, there's a burglar down there! Switch the light off! Switch it off? Then we can't see him. Switch it off! He can't switch on. I turned it off at the main board. Martin, come with me! - Who was it? - What? Who do you think it was? Don't know. We can open and look. He won't suffocate? I'm sure he's just fine! And that's how the suspicion has fallen on me. You have to prove this. I've called in a detective. You can explain it to him. What for? I've already called the police here. - You've called the police? - Yes, I have. It was the best thing to do. Come with me! Please take a seat. Martin! You stand there. And you stand there. And I'll stay here. What's this all about? Pettersson the accountant! It's not possible! Just as I thought! We're here to see Julia Lundkvist. That's me. We're from the CID. We're returning the 500 kronor that they stole from you. They were a pair of hotel thieves who used the name Hallberg. They were fine gentlemen, scientific researchers. They obviously did some research on your 500 kronor! But I already got it back! Would you have recorded the serial numbers? They're the same! Could I have a receipt? Goodbye! They stole 500 kronor, and I get 1,000 back! It's a stuff-up! I know what's happened. I took 500 from the wrong person! Stole it! I'm the thief, not him! I'm at a total loss! I got 500 too much. Give the money back to its owner as quickly as possible! Erik Kruse, legation secretary... Yes, this is legation secretary Kruse. Miss Ahlbom? I'm so awfully sorry! Would you kindly listen to me for a moment? Regarding the 500 kronor? I was just about to report it to the police. Please don't do that! Can't I return you the money? No, you can't. You can come here and tell me the whole of this remarkable story. Can we say 6 o'clock. Hi, how's tricks? Good to see you! Have you a game on? Is the heating on the blink? What do you want? We just dropped in for a drink. No can do! I'm expecting visitors. Hey kiddo, you can't turn the gang away! So what are you expecting? - Slim or plump? - Thick or fat? Perhaps something special...? Scram, you two! I have to be alone! What sort of hospitality is that? It rang! Could you at least go into another room? That never would have occurred to us. Let go of me! I didn't know you were here? A fine mess you got me mixed up in! Can you forgive me? I've come to return the money. These people can explain how it came about. I'll talk to the legation secretary. Just a moment. I'm so glad that I was wrong about you. You can explain that to Kruse. Just a moment. Who was that? That was the ski instructor you came up with. That wasn't the same guy! Wasn't it? I have a bad memory. Well, I have a very good memory! It's not memory... It's old-age calcification. Be quiet, Martin! Would you come in, please, Miss Ahlbom. Don't worry! Miss Ahlbom... take a seat! Not a soul! Not a soul! Stop twittering! Where could she be? Boo! Engaged... Erik Kruse and Greta Ahlbom! That's him! - Who is it? - Him! Oh HIM? It doesn't matter. Greta! Congratulations! How does it feel? You look so happy! Your money! One moment. One, two, three! Thank you kindly! Here you are. Farewell, my friend... All the very best! We'll look you up when you get divorced!
