The knives at my grandfather's were like this. The handle... came off. There? Is it real? Of course it is. It's bone. You find them in junk stores, car boot sales. A bit expensive now. Coats are 3 Euros, tables 4 Euros, but 12 knives can be as much as 55 Euros. Don't know why. Some lunch, just a couple of... I went to a place where a lady... Are those truffles? I can smell it now. It's truffle. Do we need some more? Shall we use the lot? We'll empty the jar without overdoing the... Good. Today is Easter Monday. It's our third session. This is April. We've got till December. This is... I'm not sure. It's in Italian... I want to ask you... May we tell the audience...? You're shooting a film. And you're playing...? I'm playing a Professor of Dermatology treating a fourteen year-old boy who is an XP child. He can't be exposed to UV rays or sunlight. Is that what XP means? It's called XP disease. It's an acrobatic feat framing hands and not the face when the hands are held up. I must move them away... Interesting... But I'm short-sighted. Makes for an unbelievable shot! You can cut. Vincent, are you aware that when I think of you I remember that when I was fifty the last famous actor I worked with was fifty too. Jean Rochefort! Is that enough? The nearest, there. This one? I'll have a bit more of that. The near one. It's tuna fish belly. This near one? No, the tuna. We'll give you some more. I reckon... That's fine. Perfect. Can you hear me? My suit cost me 480 Euros. A pair of shoes, 175 Euros and a shirt for the same amount. The shirtmaker was recommended by my producer. Obviously the production company is picking up the bill. I haven't worn a suit and tie since Cannes where I showed "Therese" in 1986. But as a young man, I frequented a tailor called Breslave who made bespoke suits for less than shop-bought ones. This is, yes, not tailor-made. It's what I want. The President mustn't look like he shops expensively. I've decided to ask you to act as Prime Minister in my next government. There. You must take time. My mind is made up, in that I have come to you. Good evening. See you tomorrow. Good night, Mr President. Check it's working in the viewfinder. Up and running! I need to just... I'm on camera. I'm a bit... I think if you take on the Prime Minister's job you'll have to give up your company. You can't do both. You can't earn money in private life and earn money as well from the public purse. Total sacrifice is required. You must not just part from your enterprise but actually sell it. Not just sell it, but keep no shares. Nothing. Only the deeds to your house in Normandy and your Paris flat. I would like, with you, gradually to establish a law... Not just a custom, or practice, but an actual law to fix the gap between lowest wage and maximum individual revenue. I may reach the end of my term without such a law being passed. In which case, what would you do? Would you stand for the Presidency? If you had made the electorate understand the need. Over the next year or two your fate cannot be predicted. Mine can. I have one thing to do before retiring. You have this thing to enact over a period not defined. My time of political power is nearing an end. I shall use it to realize a dream of reconciliation between those who have little and those who have a bit more. Do what you can with this. Make what you will of it. Be brutal. Seduce as well you know how. I've seen that on TV. Above all, criss-cross the land. The South especially. Don't forget the South! People go to the middle, politicians I mean. They go north, east, west. They don't go south. Gradually, this idea will seem shattering at first, but it will, maybe, take hold. If it could have some kind of... Suddenly... A world effect. If it could give the world a wake-up call. That would be fantastic! I'd like us to review the honours system. I don't feel comfortable with the Legion of Honour here. Let me explain. I'd like anyone leaving the country with their money, moving to another country, to have to return the insignia. Every deed must have a consequence. When you do something, you have to take responsibility. You emigrate, take your money. You can keep French nationality, we won't take your ID. But it's not honourable to take your money abroad. I want people to return the insignia. They don't merit the nation's honours. Similarly, without actually banishing them, such people must understand they are not wanted in the great houses of State. Finally, regarding illness, health insurance, they must be asked not to benefit. Finally, because no one forces us at gunpoint... Elected officials, whether in Parliament, mayors, councillors, President, Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, for the Budget, no one is forced at gunpoint. All choose freely, after consulting wives, children, friends, whomever, to represent the People. I should like any elected official who steals a single Euro from a Frenchman, just one Euro, to get the max! I'd like people to think, "If there's one thing I know, "it's that he's not robbing us." I don't want people thinking the State is robbing the People. I'm going to hand it to you. This is my job, right now. I think is how it works. It's like De Gaulle saying "I understand you!" Your glass. We've not reached agreement yet. There are still a few problems. We'll make them up. Vincent came at 8pm. He left on foot, from Denfert-Rochereau to Saint-Sulpice. We parted exhausted yet unburdened. Good morning, Prime Minister. So, let's get down to work. It's a lovely day. Not inside my head. I'm in a rage that is unspeakable. A black fury? So black! On the verge of tears. You've not been betrayed? No, but I'm just about sick to my hind teeth of all the gobshites. There! All those people, men, women, mothers, fathers, children, they're all the same. No, not the children. Everyone just compromises. Everyone looks to the short-term. No one makes long-term decisions. I was strolling down the stairs when I bumped into the owner of the building. A big-shot. It's a magnificent, five-storied building. He and his family inherited it. The absolute injustice of life. They're from Versailles, with all that implies. I don't mean to generalize but... He came down. I was minding my own business. He says, "A couple of points, Mr Lindon, if I may?" I say, "Yes, of course." He says, "Firstly, "I hope "the lift hasn't been too noisy, "hasn't troubled you overly?" "Not at all, on the contrary, I called your, er, assistant... "to say it was done with great distinction." "The other thing was about the Zadig & Voltaire store, "I know you mind the skulls and window-signs." I say, "Horrid and foul." He says, "We'll find a compromise. "We'll put up a blind inside so they can display their logo." "But why can't you just say no," I say. "It's complicated." "What's complicated? "You've made the neighbourhood impossible. "It's all designer brands, rag-trade. "Not one of you is holding out!" Then we start to talk and I say, "The lift, will we have to pay more?" He says, "Naturally." "But..." I say. "Mr Lindon," he says, "You told me you weren't against a lift." "I don't see how 'not against' means 'in favour of'. "'Not against' isn't 'for'. "I don't mind a lift for 5th or 4th floor tenants. "Or for me if I feel like using it. "But I like life without lifts. "I always walk down, I'm energetic and rushed, "I don't have time to wait. "It's mostly stuck, top or bottom "never at your floor "unless just used. "Why else would it be at your floor? "I like to walk up unless coming in from vacation. "I don't have many of those. "I use it 5 times a year or 10. Why should I pay extra?" He says, "You're funny you are, "we give you a Merc for a mini, you pay for the Merc!" "Sure," I say, "except I want to keep my mini. "Capitalism, globalization allow you to turn me... "You create an addiction. There are dealers and junkies." "You're calling me a dealer!" "Think what a dealer is. A dealer is a distributor. "Distributor, you understand? "You give, I receive. "I am compelled "to consume what you give me. "A lift! "Always the rich in relation to the weak. "You oppress." He says, "You do just fine!" I say, "Who says?" "What's your ranking?" "What ranking? "By fame? Or by pay?" "It's all the same!", he says, meaning in that clownish profession of yours. "No, it's not the same. "Films may be good or bad, "comedies more or less bad, fees higher or lower. "So I've made my choice. I make no concessions." He says, "Never?" "No, professionally, I make zero concession. "Unless you mean turning "to a channel I disapprove of for my daughter's cartoon. "Call that a concession. "Well buying food is a concession, it pollutes. "I make concessions "but I concede nothing." He says, "In any case, Mr Lindon, "you are a free man. "If you won't pay for the lift, "you are free to leave." I say, "Is that how you treat Zadig & Voltaire and their millions? "'There will be no inscriptions on the windows "'or the blinds, "'nor behind the windows "'and if you don't like it, well off you go!'" "Is that what you tell them?" "No, you shit yourselves with the big fish, "it's always the small-fry." "Tough words," he goes. "I didn't start this. You wanted to talk. "I'm like a peasant. Ask me a question, I'll reply." From a distance, that could be the nation's account-books. I like him. I like him. He's warm. A touch impulsive. I'll rein him in. He's robust. Frighteningly sympathetic. He'll be popular. What are these jars? Duck sausage and knife. Duck sausage and knife. Pan-fried leeks and pine-nuts. This is insane! Creamed artichokes and truffles. Sheep's cheese and tiny goat's cheeses. Do you want a branch? No, I'll hang it from the rear-view mirror. What's wrong with your elbow? They did this... They tapped... some synovial fluid. It's complicated... I'd need to take it off. Right here. I saw, there's a big lump. It was there like an egg. It filled up again. They're having another go or else they'll amputate. It's just a surgical operation, it's nothing. What causes it? Want some more sausage? The wild boar will be out tonight. Black olives. We'll begin now. We're playing our fictional parts. Kind of. We mix everything up. Just use... a formal "vous" form. Otherwise, say whatever occurs. It's as you please. We've known each other for 20 years. You three. And he's entered our little group. We don't know whether... we've been followed. We know nothing, do we? On the whole, they don't like my escaping without saying where. They don't like it all. I do know he knows how to get hold of them at the drop of a hat. He isn't letting me know. There's no eavesdropping here. We've got things to discuss, we'll use the car, shut it. We don't know about mikes in the car. Yes but I've trusted you for centuries. Angelo looks like an ex-football player. A former member of the French national squad in a suit. Now at the Football Association. Right, he's with the F.A. You look like a former international who works at the F.A. He's with the F.A. now. He's still really fit. He's a bit slack, he's not playing. Give him a ball though he's still 100%. He uses his head and all. Still signing autographs. It's a kind of betrayal, telling people I've worked with 25 years, suddenly confronting them with it, saying "From Monday, the boss is no longer me. "I've sold the business to a Mr Dupont or Durand." It's really ill-treating them. A bad start for me psychologically and psychoanalytically that the first thing I do as Prime Minister is tell my own employees that I've cosseted for 25 years "You'll manage! Sink or swim! "I'm off." The first French people I'll be talking to, the first I'll mistreat, are my own team! Sweetener? The sweetener's in my pocket. I've got a little speech ready. I'll go get it. That's pretty subtle. It's a neat drawer. It's really subtle. It's pretty. A bit small. But so delicate. In a company, when the lowest unqualified worker earns 50 times less than his boss there's something wrong. You need to share. I had a firm, I shared. No one bothered me. I went home, there was no trouble. They went home, they had some cash. We shared what we had. It has to be simple. God! Simple to win people over. Yes. He's right. They're simple notions. What irritates people now? To hear the Chairman of France Telecom gets 1.5m Euros. And is whining for twice that amount. The guy on the high cable in midwinter, who has to unblock the lines, how much does he get? "The President came..." "The President came to find me for a specific job." "The President came to see me..." "The President came to find me..." 'See', you said. "The President came to see me for a specific job." Go back a bit. Yes, the previous phrase. "As company chairman I agreed..." Before... OK, "It's not because I was in Parliament. "Not because I was once a Minister. "But because I run a company. That's all." "The way I run my company is based "on an agreement with all employees, "a binding legal agreement..." Yes! "Governing the gap between the lowest wages "and the highest, including mine." It's a huge task! "So as company chairman I set up a legal agreement "with every employee in my company "reducing the gap between wages including my own. "And it works. "Which is why the President asked me to join him. "We shall apply the same simple principles on a national scale. "We will do it by enacting laws." "I am sure citizens..." "Are convinced..." "Are convinced..." 'Are' is perfect. "Are convinced..." "Of the human..." "Of the human worth of this decision "for it is a just one. Good night!" Yes. Finished. - It's never been done. - It ends on a bombshell. It's never been done. It's almost like hanging up on someone. It's implacable. Life is mad. The President came to see me because he admired the way I ran my company. He expects no less of me, of my speech. But what one expects and what is before one's eyes are... It's like in a love affair. You fall in love for a reason then spend 20 years moaning about the very trait you fell for. At some point, I'll have to... I'll tell the President what is in this speech. There's a chance, even though he appointed me to do it, that he'll say, "I say, Prime Minister, it's a bit point-blank." That's like saying, "I may not pull it off!" I'm not asking what the people will think. I'm talking about me! I'm saying I'll have to go to him. The people may say has he talked to the President? Of course before I speak the President will green-light the speech. But one stage before... I'm saying I'm apprehensive. Which is natural. I should've kept quiet. Only there'll be a meeting, I'll read him this draft. I reckon he sees himself as a bit of a writer. He'll ask you to change an adjective. Literary perfectionism. To say he's had a hand in it. "Not because I've been in Parliament, and a Minister. "But because I chair a company." We could leave the word 'once' for him. Yes. "And a Minister once." We could say, he came to me with good reason. Reasons are always good. Magnificent! Excellent. 'With good reason.' Elbow sandwich. It's an elbow sandwich. It's very good. The Prime Minister read it to me. It's perfect. There was a small style error, soon amended. But it's perfect. We did re-read it. It's strong. In the bars, at the bar, people will like it. I feel I really could be Prime Minister. Given the right entourage. If I choose the right team. If I am kind and sensible. If I sort good ideas from bad. Not find ideas, just listen. Know what is good and what isn't. If I shave every morning, wear a suit and tie. I'm 51. What's to stop it? This window is occupied by my head of security. Sounds of love. I say I don't cost the nation much. But security in this house costs a fortune. This is it, my friend. If France loved you as much as I do... But... He who will deliver me a mortal blow shall pass through this door. I've asked for some ties to be bought. I've been wearing the same tie for months. Look in that tissue paper there. Not great, really. They were in the sale. They were reduced from 75 Euros, 30% reduction to 52 Euros. And the other? Were they a present? No, I paid for them. I sent for them and paid for them. 59 Euros, the other. They're very shiny. You don't like them? They're too shiny, see? Can you lend me one? Yes, I've got ties. These are a bit... I'll show you mine. If there's one you like, I can tell you where to find them or I'll have some sent round... There's one here. Ties like this. Knitted. I've got blue, black, red. That doesn't work. I've got all my ties here. This is Bluebeard's Castle! Do you keep women locked up in here? No, no women. Are you sure? It's an impressive dressing-room. But it's not so... I just never throw anything away. It's all the shoes I've had over years and years. These are my grandfather's shoes. They have an incredible advantage. They're made out of one piece. The sole is in one piece. Look how lovely it is. They're proper shoes. This one is not bad. This one too. It's this one or that. I prefer this. Fine. I think it's not bad. I'll try it. See where it's from? No! Inès de la Fressange, don't! The most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I saw her for 20 minutes. It's better than my own little tie. It's firmer. It's stiffer. Reinforced. The other, I had to blow up a bit. It's also a bit... More cheerful. Cheerful and relaxed. It allows for more severity. The difference between 'vous' and 'tu'. "Fuck you", works better with 'vous' than the intimate 'tu'. A tie like that allows... I'm boring on here but a tie like that can help me get a ratio of one to ten. Funny, the other is woollen and a little coarser and this one is soft silk. Like Inès' skin I imagine. I stopped basketball. I was in teams here and there. I went to New York, I played in Lyons. You were a top player? Professional. If there's money in sport you soon see there's no team spirit, not if there's money. I was in the main team. A substitute tried to hurt me in training, tripped me up so I got a sprain. We were in the same team! You can guess the atmosphere. Those guys, they were terrorists. Every time, he sneaked his foot under me and when I landed, bang. So he gets to play in the main team, see? Great atmosphere! As you say! A big help! It makes you think a bit. I was at Stade Français, a junior. I must have been 16. I don't reckon... I had no hair on my balls, I was a late developer. We're in the changing-rooms. The guys are saying, "What dose are you on?" Deca. I thought it meant decaf. It was deca durabolin. Nandrolone, like they give bulls. They were 16, those guys! They weren't through puberty! Imagine what it does! So Usain Bolt isn't on drugs? Sport is just that! You can't tell guys they'd better stop now. Like with money. There's no top performance. Guys will always reach for the sky. No way round it. I tell you, I didn't take stuff, not for ethical reasons, but because I'm a hypochondriac scared of what it'll do to me. If I'd had the balls I would have gone on the dope, I would have been so loaded. Die at 40, who cares? This time, we're at home, next time at the Prime Minister's office. This is nuts, it's crazy. There are times... I'd find myself 100% thinking what can we do about violent neighbourhoods? This wasn't the movie, I was in it for real. This is nuts. It's really sane too. Sane to feel... Sane to admit the thing. Sane to confess to people one likes. I've told two, three friends. I say I've got big-headed. Why isn't my advice sought on matters of state? Why doesn't the phone ring more often? I'm saying this now on camera. So I'm doing fine. Better than the country. The dough ought to be warmer. It's at 27.4 Celsius. 27.4 is warm. He's going to have hurry. It's going down to 27.3. Do you have a wife? Not found one. Luckily, I've got my mother. She keeps an eye on everything. Turn that machine off. That way we'll hear the bread. Unbelievable. A nice bit of cheese, a bit of baguette that sings... I've been doing this for thirty-three years. Do you ever want to stop? I don't know. It's my trade. It's what I learnt from the start. Given my experience here, I don't really know. If my mother stops, as I'm on my own, I'll have to give up. I don't want to lose everything. I'll become a chef. I'll work for other people. It won't be a problem. I'm punctual. I'm handy. I do everything. The boss'll be happy, in theory. You want to see how I take a nap? Well now... I go there. With my little pillow. I get half-an-hour, three-quarters. You hop up? Usually, I take the apron off. I take my nap around the time you came. I'll let you kip then. No, I'll finish what I've got to do. Will I get in position? Gosh. It'll cost you, this shot. In theory it's like this. Then I like the pillow... I switch out the light. I sleep for half-an-hour. Incredible! There. We're all set. Temperature right. Sometimes I get tired. The youngster makes the... It's soft. My little pillow, it's stained now with flour. Macaroon, Sir? I'll blow my nose first. Oh, Mum! Here, Mum. It's working. And another... There was no flash. So much for me. No flash is good. How many hands shaken yesterday? I shook a lot of hands. I wasn't counting, maybe... In the hundreds, I'd say. Not far off 1000, 700 or 800. All right? I haven't done my little... hairstyling. Is it OK? I haven't used my hairspray. Is that a problem? They've finally understood that if there's a minimum wage set by the law why not also a maximum wage set by the law? This has entered people's minds. This has entered minds. One to ten, one to eleven, twelve, thirteen... one to fourteen, one to fifteen... You know my view. I want one to fifteen so people wanting to earn a high wage are able to do so. The more adventurous, the wide-boys, the more inventive ought, I mean... reach a certain financial standard. The Prime Minister, who in his company established one to ten is for one to ten. Our host... The values are not quite the same. Cash is fantastically attractive to youth. Phenomenally so. To earn a good living is wonderful enough. But what really turns them on is big money. Big money! The pop promos people most want to watch are appalling. Rivers of money. Gyrating women. It really is a caricature. They love cash. They want it. What do the young make of that? Mr Prime Minister, you're sticking to ten? Yes. So here now, let's try these cakes. Recipes 120 years old. The long ones with icing sugar are called Brazils. They've got raspberry jam inside. Lemon tarts. And daisies. Could you leave the gate open? So I don't have to climb it. No, I don't know what time. See you later. You're letting it run. It's been running for six minutes. Right. Mr Prime Minister, you are very dear to me and I am not happy about your security. Just look. A sniper, a sharpshooter could position himself anywhere take you out in a split second. I have decided, I have taken steps. A policeman is stationed on that balcony there. Night and day, in shifts. All the workmen have been checked, their lives... They have a badge. I did not refer to you. There remains one thing. Your windows are not bulletproof as you promised. You are not to stand near the windows for now. That's almost an order. I need to make a call, say the President is a nuisance. This security business. "You should bulletproof your windows. "I'm not pleased with you. "You could be shot. I said, take care." I think it's all a sham. It's not what he means. I feel it's a ploy. I want to tell someone it's a ploy. To get me used... To tell me it's over. We've never had a fight. Everything's going fine. Well, no. I'll show you the sound of my voice when I'm not happy. I'll yell at you about something irrelevant. Security! Imagine! This is France not America. No one shoots. It's just a diversion. Like a conjuror's trick. I'll distract you and pzazz...! I'll raise the subject of safety to warn you that in a few days I'll curl up in a ball, we'll have a big fight about wage ratios. The gap between lowest and highest. You want one to ten, I want fifteen. I'll tell you little boy, we've been fine till now but I'm the President and I say, one to fifteen. There. And I don't like it. That's exactly what... Exactly what I want to say. Only it mustn't come from me. Someone else has to tell him to stop fussing over details. That's the phone call I need to make. Here's the damage! Dangerous all the same. Very. Because knowledge of where the vehicle was being mended no one knew that. I'm the only person who knew where I was bringing the vehicle. So either we were followed or I was followed in order to locate the vehicle and do that to it. It's a bit spectacular, I feel. To hurt someone, you wouldn't do that. I'll entrust this to you. I'm afraid it's a bit pointless because soon everyone will have it. Your appetite's OK! I may just pick at a biscuit. Amusing. Do pick, Minister, do! I wanted to remind you of our glass of claret, two glasses of claret if not three at the bar of the Hotel Raphael. You got up and ordered two more from the barman. You called him Pierre. For twelve years you've called him Pierre. He says no, not Pierre. Bertrand. Pierre was my father's name. He said Pierre was my father's name. Which is why he let you call him that. I found that touching. As we'd just been talking about our fathers it was a sign that we had work to do together. A good sign. Thank you. One for you, one for me. The worst thing I've held against myself all my life. I was 17. I was in love with a woman my own age. On holiday, I met another who lived in Chicago. Just like that! The day she took her train to Paris to fly home she gave me money to buy her ticket. I'd give it to her when we met. She wasn't able to buy it herself. When I was going to the café to bring her the ticket the person I lived with appeared. I kept the ticket in my pocket! That's so unlike you. It's amazing. It's not like you. I'm telling you, all my life... I keep thinking about it. I picture that woman who must be I don't know how old walking the streets of Chicago, remembering. Remembering that. She must know you. When one is President... She must see your face in the papers. She must be able to say, he stole my ticket. I can still see her! If you were to stand for President. You have the image of a man alone. The image of an attractive man who lives alone. No one has seen you photographed with a woman. I read the papers everyday. There's information I like to know. I'd like to know if my future President is happy with a woman. If he's got a wife, a mistress. If he's hesitating between one and the other, not hindering his work, no... But I'm curious, that's all. I expect people will stalk you. Just don't tell me anything. It poses problems. I know, I've been there. At one point I was between stools. I said nothing. People knew. There were hints. That's no good. But do as you please. I do care. No, but... I'm like everyone else. Yes, you are. I do know. You have one woman and a second one. You're the same as everyone else. You're not dithering between the two. You may well be happy with both. The day you're President, people will know. Game over. I'm naïve enough to believe if it's not known now people won't know when I'm President, if by chance or misfortune I ever am. I believe there is a strong chance of that. It's not the same though. No. It's the top job. - It's not the same. - The ultimate recourse. The nation's representative. The guarantor of national honour and citizens' safety. President of the Republic. President, even if his authority is... On that score he must not, cannot be sullied in his function. That's all. We'll move on to wages, what you're doing. We'll be brief as we've discussed it a lot. The principle is one you are still extraordinarily in favour of. You believe it will solve all-out war and hatred between people. Given money is at the centre of everything. I believe that it is the absolute basis. If we settle this wage business people will be a thousand times happier. But they don't follow. Which is maddening. One is unpopular for supporting the good! This is the obstacle I've reached. I find it revolting. It's making me mad. The presidential elections are coming up, the campaign. You'll have to come into the open. Do we carry on with this business? Or do we play a conjuring trick? We carry on, but put something else in the manifesto. I don't know. It won't be me who, after... If you're elected... I mean I can promise anything, who cares? If I'm to leave the stage? Are you really quitting? Do you really want to? That's the question. Are you really fed up? Do I want another go? Do you want another go? My fellow-citizens, I believe, granted my amazing fitness that I may ask you for a fresh mandate. But I can't. I'm worn out. I actually don't want any more. But I hate my proposed successor and I'll press your chances in any way I can. Are you OK with the President? Do you discuss the elections? That's a start! Which is your glass? That one. We've got through a litre. We're working for French winemakers. We can say that! I wish that my ashes should be dispersed from the top of the steeple of the Church of the Trinity in Vendôme. What would be the best if... A medical excuse, or a professional one? Our target is not the same. It's not the same people. We've got intelligent people here. Before we had cretins. Imbeciles. We're talking about people who are sitting at their desks. Or people that are completely... who want their little wage, their job for life. They've fixed their course. Power is not about saying no, it's about saying yes. Have we had the headcount, yet? It's not good. Meaning we're 10 or 15 votes short of a majority? Twenty. Ah. Twenty votes? What is it about this law? Why are the French...? What's bugging them? That it's a law imposed by the state? They're wary nowadays. It's a law that's... They're saying we're liars. It's unenforceable. Too complicated. That's it, isn't it? They don't see the humanity in the business. I proposed it and now I don't know what to say or do. I don't know! I'm not looking into your eyes. Any idea? You? What'll we do? You must absolutely be President of the Republic. Which is tricky because we had a formula. Why a law for low wages and not for maximum wages? That was our idea. Now we've found this. No wage may exceed the President's. That was good. We agreed that. One to fifteen. It had a strength! It's funny human thing, awful. That's what gets me too, exhausts me about the race for power. It's not a race for power. Power is within reach. No need to race for that. You need to race for this law. He's like Fouchet. Talleyrand and Fouchet! The chocolate-maker? He thinks basely, he thinks accurately. He thinks basely, he thinks accurately? He makes fun of everything. Laughs at it. No. He's in despair. Ah yes! I did want... Thibault, you were brought a document. Can you give it to the Prime Minister? I am told it's a compromising photograph of your electoral opponent. I haven't seen the photograph. It's for you. Unbelievable. Is it very aggressive? May I? Please. After you. Go ahead. My Lord. How weak is man. Don't you want to leave it with me? It is of no interest to me. It is not a weapon. No, it isn't... I shouldn't like... I'd despise anyone who had that against me and used it. I won't do what I'd not have done to me. I don't give a toss. Of course, if he is elected, it will look bad. Rather! It's your decision. Yes but, the answer lies in your phrase. If he is elected. That is why it must not be seen. If he is elected... Poor France. It will sully... It sullies the... What will be tricky, for as long I live whether I'm elected or I lose to him is how, over the years, not to tell him I've seen this picture. That's what's nagging. If he wins I'll want to say, see how gentlemanly I was. I had this and didn't use it. If I'm elected, I'll want to say I had this and didn't need it to win. I believe I'll be weak one day and use it privately with him. Say I had this in my pocket. What's funny to me is that whenever I see him I'll think... The picture is there. I can destroy it. It's there. If I raise it with him, it shows I've seen it. It should be kept though. Certainly. I'll keep it. One never knows. One never knows. I'm sorry to touch you. He doesn't like it. I know he doesn't like it. He says it's not true but he doesn't. I do. I am scripting your political future. I write the script every night before sleep. I won't say what's in it. After watching TV? I didn't watch last night. But he's got a little problem. A big one even. Yes, a big one. Is he going to send us packing or will he carry on? We could place bets. How much? 50 Euros max. Fine. 50 Euros, he becomes President? That isn't... the way to put it. No, it's, for 50 Euros... He stumbles. Yes, he refuses. He refuses. To give the business up. Come, my love. Here. 3000 Euros. No anaesthetic. Was it the President who did that or was it me? My father had it. I'd see it on him and dislike it. I disliked it, I disliked his authority over me. I disliked the complacency and the pleasure he took in his power as a senior civil servant. The problem is that today I resemble him. I am him. His clone. So I regret judging him harshly. Today, I love him. Quite a surprise! You can't see very well. Fallen. I don't know if it's the hour or the overcast sky. Is it only the hour? It's the hour. It's a spectacle. In summer, it's amazing, I get the sun setting over there. It sets back down there. We're not making progress. No, yes... I saw a Swede once... I put up two villages with 150 or 160 houses apiece... May I interrupt? I've written a letter of resignation to the President. I want to know what you think. I want to read it to you. Mr President, I offer my resignation as Prime Minister. You told me I was the best candidate for President. I have prepared with your help. Today, our supporters ask and you with them that we back down on wages. Else the opposition emerge as victor. It is hard to abandon a law designed to improve relations between men. I intend to devote all my energy to giving this law a place in citizens' hearts and minds. Therefore, I shall stand alone, without the support of your majority which must find another candidate. I hope this will be you. The nation's choice will clearly emerge from our confrontation. In round one, a single opposition candidate will stand. He or she will be present in round two. Either you or me will have gone. Never mind which. Citizens' rights to transparency, full information and respect will have been demonstrated. Mr President, thank you for fetching me to accomplish a mission that I must pursue. Now, here I've drafted an ending over which I need your help. I find it a bit literary or lyrical. But strong too. So, thank you for fetching me to accomplish a mission that I must pursue. I want all to know I am not causing division. I am opening life's doors. I am shutting out backwardness and fear. Please be assured, Mr President, etc. There. "I am opening life's doors. "Shutting out backwardness and fear." It's a bit... The last sentence sounds hollow. It's overwritten. Which is why... - That's my view. - I want that. The sentence seems a bit hollow. It's well-written but doesn't ring true. So? What you want is to hit home. No one understands me today. No, I understand you. I know it means... I'm trying to... I won't stop there. No one knows what I'm saying. You, you. No one. Either I'm mad or you're asleep, gents. I'm not asking what... I know what it means. I wrote it! Every time I write a speech, we fight. It's unbelievable! If you want the message to get through, to aim at the President directly don't be poetic. I'm not. I'm resigning. "I am opening life's doors", really! Ah, right. Except for... I only mean the last bit. Oh fine. The rest is fine. You said the end. The rest is fine. So it's the last bit. Where there's doubt, there's no doubt. No doubt at all. Well I'll make my decision. You are setting out to conquer so the slight veil of sadness in your eyes won't go before the electorate? No, but there, I've changed too. I'm much less sad. Really? Still a bit maybe, but no, there's been huge change. I say that not to disapprove. No. I take you and film you as you are. I cannot judge how you are. Will we be genuine opponents or fake ones? Genuine! Genuine. Sometimes you'll pass through a town. 24 hours later, I'll pass by the same town. After you or before you. It'll be strange, won't it? Perhaps I'll come to like knocking you down. You'll hate me, detest me. The son will stab the father. Excellent. I'll bite the dust. Then we'll have to fight the other. Our real opponent is the one who's after me. Now money-matters. Is there enough? I know where the money for my campaign is. But you? You'll have to find some. Yes. You'll manage. Exactly. Can we speak on the phone? Should we not see each other? After being so close. All I will say and we'll talk about this later, is that what I do resent, I won't hide this, is that even though you gave me a break, a second break by coming to fetch me... With your powers of conviction and I have seen you convince many, you could have told the party, "Listen to him, I trust him. "I love him, I trained him. "I collaborated on this wage business with him. "In the name of our bonds of loyalty, support him on this one. "So that you do not part, "neither him from you nor you from him. "Follow him to the end of the battle." You did not do that. I did. I did do it. But not openly because those things are best whispered in the hollow of the ear. - Is that it now? - That's it. Interesting it ends now. In the hollow of the ear. But I did do it relentlessly. Which is why I'm sad now it hasn't worked out with the party and you must go. That was not my aim. I can hear you eating your nuggets. That's my rug, for when my knees get cold. Little darling. Tiny darling who was such a help. Thank you. One day, I won't have the strength to climb these stairs. All right. Can I go ahead? Everything's fine. Let's open up. There you are. Give me that. - Is this a changing-room? - I'm sorry. There you go. I've had enough. If people saw this I know they'd say we're less stuck-up than they think. That's for sure. They ought to see this. - I'll pop by. - Do. Go ahead. Picture. There we are. Great, thanks. Lower taxes all the same... Lower taxes all the same. For those who don't earn much. We do need taxes, if we're to have hospitals and... But they will need to lower their lifestyles a bit. - Who? - The big cheeses. 3 bottles of Burgundy for 3 people. For 3 people! You've got to be serious. We're serious men here. Because after there's cheese. A spot of dessert. The very least. You said that! If a dolly-bird appears, you can't always refuse. If a dolly-bird appears, you can't always refuse. She's got to suck. But not on your wallet. Wow! I've appointed a new Prime Minister. The viewer's met him. He's at home, at the smallest desk I've ever seen. He's got a bike too. The new Prime Minister's desk is small but his kitchen is large. It wasn't your intention to stand for a further five... No, not at all. Not at all but listen, now I've got to stand. You've all forced me to stand. As I'm for now the only presentable candidate. You refused. So I must stand or we've no majority candidate. The trouble is that suddenly... Five more years, just because he took this decision now open up before me. I'd got all that out of my mind. Sincerely so! But now I do feel an attraction. It's coming back. That's where you come in, you see? Why do you need three speeches? I have got three. I can't do as the ex-Prime Minister. Provincial rallies. I can't. I need a big meeting in the North, at Lille. Another big one in Paris and another in the South. As I've only three speeches to make, they will have to be terribly powerful. I'll write an outline then we'll go over it word by word. It'll be... I love looking at computers. I don't own one. I don't know how to use them. Crime rates are down 2%. Crime is down 2%. How very precise! I don't have a mobile phone. I have no car. Total freedom. I own nothing in my name. Two wooden tables and two chairs. Not one share. My intention, this must be my schooling... Is to spend it all! Church schooling, is of course to burn both tables for warmth, to brew my coffee just before I die. I shall fly off light as air. That's my church schooling. Believing suddenly that like the soul one can leave one's load... It rises so high. The light stuff dissolves in azure. That must be what makes me a bit optimistic. Makes me find this land pleasant to live in. He never called. He never called to say, Vincent Alain Cavalier wants me as Prime Minister. I just want to say that in the movie I've climbed the ranks. Nothing? I told Alain once I want you to meet Bernard as I did with you. Alain said, yes, he's very good, excellent. He's so kind, Bernard. We shot in his house at Étretat. He's retired now. He was in ads. Chairman of an ad company. He moves between Étretat and Paris. Suddenly, he's in an Alain Cavalier film, no less! He gets as the story progresses, Alain gives him more and more days. He doesn't call. To say, Vincent, it's really cool. I shot one scene, two, three... I was Foreign Minister. Foreign Minister, was it? Whatever! Hard to tell. Think he would call, the faggot! To say it's really cool! Unbelievable! Neither Bernard the actor nor Bernard the Prime Minister called me. Nor the friend. Nor my friend. Alain told me all the same. Really? Alain said, I want you to know that Bernard is from today my new Prime Minister. With a certain satisfaction. Yes, kind of this will rile Vincent! He's totally out of it. Aside. I've just had some ultra-confidential information. You're ahead. Not by much. But you're ahead of the President. This is good all right! We've won! We haven't won but it's good. I'll have a pee. With our own tiny means. OK, right, we've not won. Fantastic. It's only... But it's a good omen. It's better than a fist in the face. It's starting to... We're off! He's second. I'm third. It's over for me. I'll creep off-camera like a cat, gently. If I'd done Rennes and Strasbourg as well, I'd have beaten him. I'd didn't have the stamina. It's over. Lille, Paris, Toulouse drained me. What is it? - Morning, Angelo! - Mr President! Traditionally and for the last time! The elections are today. We'll have a new President. Give me that. I'll put it somewhere. Sit at my right, we'll settle our affairs. So will our comrade win? I'm not entirely sure. Did you get 70 Euros worth? 60? Today, I got a hundred, Sir. A hundred! Beauty of beauties. I was trying to work out how many times we'd scratched on a Sunday when I was in France over the last five years. That's magic! Right, now we'll see. I trust it will be a very very fine day. Ah! Solitaire! I love that! One French person in two earns less than 1500 Euros. One in two! Right, Astro. Leo. I'm Virgo. You are? Scorpio, Sir. Ah, Scorpio. A danger to yourself. Absolutely. When I say I'm a Virgo, everyone laughs. When I say I'm a Virgo rising Virgo they clutch their sides. I do hope that 100 Euros allows for some return. We'll do the accounts. We've lost 60 Euros! We've lost 60 Euros. Never mind. It'll pay for a bit of roadway. If they spend the money well. I am no longer the President. Well... We are no longer either of us. We're ordinary guys. Normal. You have a giant future. I had a thought. I'm going to... There. It's not much. But still... As I have total confidence in the fact that you'll be President in five years' time. I hope you'll wear this. I pass it on. But where's...? I had a little plastic pouch. I don't wear it always. When I go out to a restaurant, I don't wear it. I had a pouch. I'll give it you, you can... You can wear it on... There. It's not a sceptre. I'm not royal. It's a tiny thing. A tiny certainty as to your future, your political skills. This herring! I know where it came from. I'll say! The best purveyor. For a few days yet, we'll treat ourselves like people... We might almost... This is almost the end. We might nearly shoot angle and reverse. Meaning you film me then hand it to me. You put it on... Right, bang! First time, bang! We'll do it. First time you put it on... Angle and reverse. You hold out your hand. I've shot you giving it to me. I've held my hand out. So now, you... Wait! I give it to you, you give it back. It was my other hand! No one'll notice. I used this hand. We'll cheat the cut. Wait, first I need to press the... There. I've no envelope, nothing. Well, I'll need to... This is yours. A symbol to say one day I'll be there. I'll need to earn it! - Tonight we can make believe. - I'll wear it for the first time. It will feel funny. - Everything's allowed. - It's brilliant! Quite something. Now... I could really believe this. Sometimes when I used to look in the mirror I felt a warm rush. It's quite something! At the same time, I'd think silly me. No, it's like when you're little, you wear a cowboy outfit. Anyway, this is a movie, it's not real. If it's a movie, then it's real. It's brilliant! I'd love to go into a restaurant dressed like this... So that, I'll need... This is yours, a symbol to say I'll have it one day. But I must earn it. - Tonight we can make believe. - It's the first time I'll wear it. It's going to feel funny. - Everything's allowed. - It's brilliant! It's quite something! Now... I could really believe this. Sometimes when I used to look in the mirror I'd feel a warm rush. Ah, it's quite something. At the same time, I'd think silly me. No, it's like when you're little, you wear a cowboy outfit. Anyway, this is a movie, it's not real. If it's a movie, then it's real. This is brilliant! I'd love to go into a restaurant dressed like this really relaxed. Even though Inès is still tight around my neck. Good to take one's tie off. It's a release. And when it comes loose... My shirts are not as luxurious as yours. The fabric is a bit stiff. The fabric is magnificent. But I find it stiff. Yours are supple. You patronize a better shirtmaker than I. You've taught me a bit on that front. That helped me with the snobs. So. Well if that isn't in the movie! Subtitles by Pierre Hodgson Subtitling by C.M.C.
