Right. When can I start, Captain? We got two towers on the perimeter. One on the inside. Basically, guys who poke their eyes out, secure our guys and then we hightail it back to Turkey. Any questions? There was two of us behind enemy lines. DOD let us rot. What's that, Sergeant? Nothing, Captain. Based on the latest satellite pass, Saddam is sending reinforcements down to defend.. So he's falling for our bluff. - Right. And while he's looking down South, Delta will swoop in from the North and grab our boys at Amadiya. Are you confident that Lang's ODA can handle this alone? Based on the Intel, yeah, I am. Heckers, take point. Looks like we spoke too soon. We got motion sensors here. This is great. Because we trusted intel, we've got no other option. Falcon One this is Jackknife. Do you copy? This is Falcon One. Jackknife, go ahead. Patch me through to command. We got a major problem here. Will do, Captain. Jackknife, this is Mercury Leader. What's going on there? Over. Intel was for shit, sir. We lost the element of surprise and we're still in the bush. Do you still have a shot at opening the objectives? Over. Hutch? Mercury Leader, do you copy? Mercury Leader, do you copy? Falcon One, do you copy? You got to be fucking kidding me. Captain, this place is sewn up tighter than Fort Knox. Falcon One, do you copy? Dammit! We lost contact. Christ. OK. This way. I know Mike Lang. Didn't even request backup. I don't care, Norm. Just pull the plug on it before it becomes a major embarrassment. I agree. The last thing we need is another goddamn Tehran. Take that bunker there. Aw, fuck that, Captain. If we don't extract now, we're history. Did I ask you for your assessment, Sergeant? No, but... Then save it for your report. I have them It's a minefield. Falcon One, you in for of little mine sweeping? Bloom's on the way, Jackknife. All right, Begs. Bring her in, baby. We got a smokescreen. Party time, gentlemen. Let's party. Vickers, right flank. In position. Cap, two bogey, 6 o'clock. Hutch, take him with you. I got him, Cap. Hutch, behind you. Get your ass down. We got a heavy. 10 o'clock, Cap. Bunker's clear. Lombardi, let's move. Second bunker clear, Mac. Go! Go! Go! We're on the move. Let's go, go, go, go, go. More company, 11 o'clock, Cap. Jackknife, we've reestablished the. Jackknife, what's going on? Mercury Leader, we still have a shot of fulfilling the objective. Over. Jackknife, this is Mercury Leader. Pull the plug, Mike. Over. Jackknife to Mercury Leader, come in. We got our orders, Cap. Let's get the hell out of here. That's enough, Lombardi. They could have moved the pilots by now. Jackknife, this is Falcon One. Proceeding to the primary LZ. Negative, Falcon One. Maintain your position. I repeat, hold your position. - What are you doing? We've been ordered to abort? Then you abort. The rest of us have got a job to do. Could we make up our minds? We're not leaving here without our guys. What's the call, Cap? We take that bunker, we're in. Then let's fucking do it. Mac, take point. Move! Go, go, go! I've got cover, go! Cap, we got more trouble. Like the 4th of July, guys. Mac, take your position. All right, it's now or never, boys. Mac, Hutch, let's go get our guys. In position. Third bunker secured, Cap. Now! Come on! Curve ball. Morning, boys. Delta Force. Someone call for a taxi? Stand back, man. Falcon One, proceed to the secondary LZ. This is Falcon One. I got it. Let's go. Vickers, now. Come on, Doc. Let's go. Vickers, copy. On my way. Vickers, abort. Get the hell out of there. Go, go, go, go go! Lombardi, come in. Lombardi, do you copy? Lombardi? Lombardi, do you copy? Lombardi, come in. Lombardi, do you copy? Your guy's probably dead, Captain. We need to mosey now. No fucking way! You get us close to that bunker, we're going in after him. I'm sorry, sir, I can't. It would be suicide. Then get out of the fucking seat. I will fly the chopper. I can't. Do it! Do it! Shit. Man. You guys are fucking great. You're gonna be fine? Yeah, I've earned it. He's gonna be fine. Mercury Leader, this is Jackknife. We're on our way home... All of us. Hi, sweetheart. Well, there's the two most beautiful women in the world. Are you ready for dinner? I'm famished. You? I could eat. Let's go. Annie, honey, you still wish you'd stayed home? No, I'm glad I came. Just tell me those backwater dolts from Alabama aren't sitting with us again tonight. Aw, Ruth, you didn't tell her. Those people walked the plank this morning. Listen, you two go on head. I've got to go up to the bridge room. See you soon. See you soon. After all these years of service, the Kursk is not going to rot in dry dock? Yes, it makes us all very sad, Captain. Da. Da. We're approaching the final leg, sir. Very well. Make our depth 35 meters and.. Depth, 35 meters. All ahead two terms. Cap, I don't know what the hell happened back there, but I owe you one. You owe nothing, Lombardi. I just wanted you to know. Let's just get this thing over with, all right? I mean, we bust our asses for these people and this is the thanks we get? A court martial. Look it's not a court martial, it's just a hearing. Yeah, well, it's still bullshit. Watch, it's going to be fine. Excuse me. Is everything all right? The rest of your table will be here shortly. OK. Good evening, ladies. How's the champagne? Did you hear Admiral Henshaw's order to abort, Sergeant? Yes, sir. Then didn't it strike you as odd that Captain Lang chose to ignore that order? No, sir. Command wasn't in full possession of all the facts, sir. In case you've forgotten, Malcolm and Hoskins are now safely at home with their families. Do you have families, sirs? Thank you, Sergeant. That will be all. Yes, sir. The ship's first ladies. This way, please. Where's Gregory tonight? He came down with a sudden condition. But my name is Tuck, and I'll be your host for the evening. Thank you, Tuck. I'd say you ladies look lovely. That's so kind of you. Mrs. Lang... Thank you very much. Hello. Hello. Ms. Lang. I'm Ruth Lang. This is my daughter, Annie. Golder and Hiriam Lifschitz. Nice to meet you. If you would need anything, just let me know. Thank you. Are you enjoying the cruise? I just love the ocean. Everything set? Where's Mikhail? OK, boys. Time to load and lock, and rock and roll. Sergei, you secure port. Mikhail, go starboard. Tell me, Master Sergeant Lombardi, as second in command, did you have any problem with your captain's decision to ignore a clear order? No, sir. I didn't consider the order valid, sir. Even though Captain Lang's insubordination resulted in injury to yourself? Yes, sir. The fact that mine was the only injury supports my belief that Captain Lang made the right decision, sir. Thank you, Master Sergeant Lombardi. You may step down. So did you have a chance to talk to dad about Michael last night? I tried, Annie. But he just kind of tuned out. Listen, Hiriam, they're playing your favorite piece. This whole thing has gone on way too far, mom. It's beyond ridiculous. I know. Yeah. Ma'am... Hey, what you doing, man? Get out of here. Aw, madame, sir, I apologize. I'll get someone to come clean this up right away. Sorry. Nobody move, not even a twitch. Who are you? What is this? Who's next? We're having a sales this week. Buy one get one free. Nobody? That's good. Now, get on back in the passage way. Not you two shit for brains. Get down there and fly the god damn boat. Go, into the salt. Shut up! That means you too, Captain. You must understand, Captain, this way the Kursk will not be so easily forgotten. You sure that's everyone? Right on schedule. Mr. Wilkins, have we made our starboard... Sorry, folks. It seems that that was the last concerto. Security, this is the captain. Lay to the bridge, on board emergency. Now, if you'll all kindly get out of your seats, and lay flat on the floor, we can carry on with this evening's festivities. All the joking aside, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the first violin. You get the fuck down! Now, get on the fucking floor and don't make me say it again. If we all remain calm and follow instructions, no one will be hurt. Hiriam? Hiriam? Hiriam, don't. But you get up, you get dead. Simple. Hiriam, please. Now, I personally have other matters to attend to, but I've given my men full authorization to execute my wishes... No pun intended. Never again. Hiriam, please don't go. Never again. Never again. Mister, you don't look too long for this world as it is, but you don't get back down on that floor immediately, you're going to be meeting the grim reaper ahead of schedule. For god's sake. Listen to him, Hiriam. Hiriam, get down. Now shut up. One last time, folks, disobedience is severely frowned upon. It will not be tolerated. Good evening. Hello, Captain. Turn around slowly please. Mayday, Mayday, this is Captain. Lang of the "Northern Star." Any station this net. Unfortunately, we need him alive. You know that. This is Captain Lang of the "Northern Star," I say again, mayday, mayday, may... Listen, pal. You son of a bitch. It was self defense. But that, that was to make a point. You need to find a less lethal way of communicating. Maybe so, Captain. But as long as we understand each other. You want to tell me what the hell this is all about? Attention "Northern Star" passengers and crew, as of this moment, my men and I are in control of this vessel. If you're in your cabin... if you are in an unsecured common area, you have one minute to return to your cabin in an orderly fashion. Anyone spotted in an unsecured common area one minute after the conclusion of this message, will be considered a threat and shot on sight. This is mos definitely not a drill, ladies and gentlemen. So have a nice day. Let's go. Listen, I don't know what your plan is, but it's not going to work. Yes it will, Captain. And you're going to play a large part in it. Admiral? This just came in from the Alaskan Coast Guard station on St. Lawrence Island. How many passengers on board? 2,842. We should have a complete passenger manifest in 30 minutes, tops. Hijackers making any demands? No, not so far. Give me the manifest and crew list as soon as you can. Certainly, sir. Patch me through to Lawrence Island... Yes, sir. As soon as you can. We got a ping. Mikhail, reduce speed, one third. Aye, aye, sir. Reduce speed one third. Sergei, get me a signature on that contract. Single surface contact at 3,200 meters, bearing zero, three, three and turning. That's got to be them. Mikhail, bring me the periscope depth. Yes, sir. Bring us up to periscope depth. At periscope depth, sir. Hot damn and he got her jacked. Stage two complete. Mikhail, bring us to surface, come alongside, and coordinate a full stop. Yes, sir. Will you get these fucking stiff out of here. They're bleeding all over the place. We wouldn't want to upset set our guests. Tuck my man, what's your 20. Reading you loud and clear, friend. Any problems in your end? No, nothing. Out-fucking-standing. The cap? Standing by. Get him ready for transfer. Lukash out. Sir, voice print analysis just came back, 98% probable. What do you know? Flint Lukash. Jack, one of the most cunning, criminal masterminds in the world is not dabbling in a straightforward hostage scenario. - I know. Doesn't make any sense. Run it again. Yes, sir. OK, run it again. Welcome aboard the Kursk, Captain Lang. Quite a vessel, isn't she? Come on, don't look so glum. We're professionals. You ought to thank me. I'm about to put you with the Khan, of a typhoon class nuclear submarine, and I guarantee you, it's gonna be a hell of a ride. So cheer up. Besides, it will help you take your mind off Peter. Gertrude operational? Yes, sir. Tuck? I'm about to make the move. Mikhail, if you will. I still don't think this is necessary. I agree. Why should we call attention to ourselves when we could proceed undetected? Because we have a deadline to meet. And at this stage of the game we don't have time to sprint and drift. We have to sprint, period. You understand? Then shut the fuck up and do your jobs. Lukash controls a ballistic missile submarine? For a man like him, no problem stepping aboard. So where does the "Northern Star" fit into this? Coming to that right now. There's the Kursk. There's a "Northern Star." Of course. A human shield. Admiral? Here's the crew list you asked for. Halsey Lang? Skipper of the "Northern Star." Retired quietly from active service when his son was killed in Lebanon. The skipper of a cruise ship ever since. I don't believe it. Traded in a nuclear attack sub for the "Love Boat." No, no. Not exactly. He was a landlubber for a while. It didn't suit him. Saltwater in the veins. You know the type? Yeah. I know the type. It's time to face the music. More like a slap on the wrist. Captain Lang, would you please rise? If I might speak off the record for a moment. I've known your father for 30 years. A model military man in every possible respect. Truly one of this country's finest. I can only imagine the distress this incident must be causing him. With all due respect, sir, you don't know my father as I do, so could we please just get on with it? By order of the Supreme Commander of USS SOCOM this hearing is adjourned until further notice. Captain Lang, sir, would you follow me please? Admiral Henshaw is waiting for you on Vid Link. Mac? What the hell was all that shit about his father? I don't know. Christ, Captain, how did you spend 30 years in these miserable tubes? You'll think miserable, about the first time a torpedo locks onto us. That ain't going to happen. Not as long as we're under the "Northern Star." And once we split off with you with the CON, they ain't gonna find us. Pigs will fly out of your ass before you get any help from me, Lukash. Halsey, Halsey, Hal... You gotta think about your beautiful wife and daughter. Now, how many torpedoes do you think it would take to sink the "Northern Star?" My guess would be about three. You wouldn't do that, Lukash. There's 3,000 souls aboard that ship. Are you kidding me? Just the idea of sending 3,000 complacent overweight Americans to the bottom of the Bering Strait just makes me. Now, you got to look on the bright side. Maybe your wife and daughter will be one of the lucky ones blown apart by the blast. Shit, no. They're in top cabin. No, nope. They're going to go into that water. Ew, going in 40 degree water's gotta be bad. Standing by. You copy, Flint? Start the broadcast. Broadcasting now. Well, boys and girls, you must be wondering now what is Flint up to. Well, here's your helpful hint for today... Mountains topple ever more into seas without a shore. Seas that restlessly aspire, surging in disguise of fire... Poe. Now, hear this you overpaid stuffed shirts, any action taken against the Kursk or the "Northern Star" will leave me no choice but to sink her. That's it for now, ladies, but don't touch that dial. I'll be back. Now what's the bastard's agenda? What's Moscow's position on the Kursk? Captain Belov of the Bremov has been issued a kill order. What? There's close to 3,000 American citizens... I understand Mr. Sunland, please believe me. Moscow's response would be the same, even if "Northern Star" were carrying 3,000 Russians. Certainly you must realize that the Bremika type of vessel, even without it's missiles, is a very formidable weapon. Look, we will work with you on a way to neutralize it so it wouldn't put American lives at risk. Our worst case projections, put the casualties on the "Northern Star" at less than 15%. That is awfully optimistic. Not at all. We have already transferred to the area some rescue vessels in case of need. Bremov will certainly not strike until those vessels are in place. That's still unacceptable, Ambassador. Look, let's put our heads together... I haven't requested or respectfully declined any such offer. How also want your supply ships be positioned. If Lukash maintains his present course, approximately 16 hours. We can land a team on the ship, we take control, veer off course. And Bremov can fire on the Kursk without endangering innocent lives. I see no reason why Moscow should object to that, Mr. Ambassador. I will contact the Kremlin immediately. Get the ball rolling, Norm. Sir, I have the Kursk and the "Northern Star" at 6,000 meters, bearing zero, one, four, 33 knots. Very well. Now, we wait. That's my father's ship. My mother and Annie we're planning on... They're on the ship too, Michael. I'm sorry. The fact that your mother and sister were on board is probably just shitty luck. But your father probably figured into Lukash's plans. The odds are, he's not on the line at this point. I'm sorry. I understand. We are evaluating options as we go along. We'll know more by the time you reach the.. So that's the situation. Cap, if we don't pull this off, what happens to your father? Man, if that was my dad on that sub, I'd have a tough time focusing. Yeah, me too. Come on, nothing gets in the way. I mean, if that doesn't underlie all our training, what does? Yeah, you're right, Hutch. But this situation is a little out of the ordinary. This is Cap's business, so let's just let him deal with it, all right? It's a variable we have no control over. My thoughts are not going to be on my father's safety, believe me. If he knew I was part of this mission, I don't think his would be on mine either. It's a long story, guys. Basically, my father and I... we don't talk. 15 minutes to target. Somehow he just can't believe that Pete's decision to go into the special forces wasn't somehow influenced by me. After Pete was killed during an op in Lebanon, my father made a choice. He's an irrational, stubborn son of a bitch, but he's still my father. It's not that I don't care about him, I just sort of put him out of my mind. 10 minutes to target. So, in the heat of an op, there's so much going on, so much to think about, believe me, it's not going to be a problem. All right? Yes, sir. All right? All right. Everyone on the upper deck, check out the chopper. 3, 2, 1, jump. Dock, this is coming about. Lombardi, Hutch, lower deck. Everyone, to go. Give it up, asshole. I've got you surrounded. You got no way out. Come and get me. Cocky son of a bitch. Right on the side on three. I'm losing my patience here, pocky. Not now. Don't get testy, soldier. Set 1, 2, 3. Dining room... let's go. Support ships report they're in position, Captain. 6,350 meters of target, bearing zero, zero, two. Fighting solution is ready. Make tubes one and four ready and open the outer doors. Room reports tubes one and four ready, and outer doors are open. Yes, sir. We give them 15 minutes, and then we fire. Smoker's in. Everyone, stay down! Clear. All right, everyone, you're safe now. Michael. Bastards. Just lean on me. It's all over now. Where's your father? I think he's been moved to a hijacked Russian sub. It's running beneath the liner. You're going to go there, aren't you? I'll be OK, Annie. As soon as I find out something, I'll get word to both of you. OK? Be careful. I will. You take care of each other. All right? I gotta go. I'll be fine. "Northern Star" is slowing, sir. Turning hard to port. Kursk? Maintaining course and speed, sir. "Northern Star" is to port. Son of a bitch. Tuck, come in. Fire tubes one and four. Tubes one and four fired electrically tuck. Tuck? God dammit! High speed screw noise, incoming. Target the "Norther Star" and sink her. Lukash, for Christ sake, don't do this. Why not, captain. What's in it for me? My help. Two torpedoes, bearing one, seven, two, one, seven, six. Range... 4,100 meters and closing fast. Solution on "Northern Star" ready. Provided you give me your solemn word you'll spare the "Northern Star." You have it as a professional. Captain Lang, you have the COM. Sergei, find out where those torpedoes came from. Are there countermeasures aboard? Yes, sir. Very well. Set one to simulate evasive maneuvers. Torpedoes at 2,200 meters. Get it in the water. Firing solution on unidentified contact... ready. Blow it out of the water. Firing tubes two and three. Lukash, I've got the deck and the COM. Torpedo one is changing course. It's honing in on the decoy. Classification of new contact confirmed, sir. It's the Bremov, the Bass class. - Range to the incoming. Torpedo two at 600 meters, 500, 450... Helm, stand by to come hard starboard on my command. Sir. 300 meters. 250. Helm. Hard starboard. All ahead blank. Fire the port-side countermeasures. Torpedo two is maintaining course. It's going for the countermeasures. High speed screw north port side. Bearing, zero, eight, zero, zero, eight, four. And make your depth 300 meters. Power maximum, depth 300 meters. Depth, 300 meters. Getting hull break up noises from the Bremov. She's going down. Well, this time we were lucky. Now, let's just disappear while we can. Maintain present course, maximum prudent speed. Happy? That was outstanding work there, cap. Lukash, you gave me your word. Yeah. That I did. That I did. And I'll hold to it, too. On one condition. And that is that you'll take the COM again, if the situation arises. Very well. Still no sign of the Kursk? Realistically, if she's running deep, then our chances of finding her are slim to none. Great. Now what? We sit around jerking off until Lukash decides to show himself? Good question. What's our involvement going to be from here on out? Nothing active for the time being. It's Russia's problem now. Roipren, what are you doing? How much longer... the final leg? Another five hours. And then the? Another four at least. Great. Tuck's fuck up has put us four hours behind schedule. Four fucking hours. There is a way we could save some time. How much time are we talking about? Probably close to three hours. Would you like to explain to me why we weren't going this way in the first place? It's risky. The water is quiet shallow at several points. Our heat signature could be picked up by the satellite. Could be. Look, we are trying to slip through a very narrow window here that is slowly closing. I don't want to get caught with my pants down in Europe. Captain, what would you do? Definitely go the short route. We'll go that way. Course 233, all ahead, flank speed. Yes, sir. Gentlemen, Lukash is headed for the sub base at Port Yeramin. Yeramin? I have been authorized to tell you of a code red situation at Yeramin. During the night, soldiers serving as security took control of the base just hours before a shipment of ballistic missiles were to be moved to the dismantling facility at Markovo. You wouldn't be telling us this if you'd retaken that base. True enough. Ambassador, what measures has Moscow have already implemented? We have already sent a force to Yeramin. Will they get there before Lukash? We're not sure yet. If he leaves that base, they'll be able to target the whole of the Western seaboard. Not to mention mainland Russia. Ambassador, it's in the best interest of both our countries that we cooperate on this. My government agrees with you. Good. We have a unit within striking distance of Yeramin. One of the very best. ,, get the video phone system online. It's time to let Washington and Moscow know what their peace dividend's going to cost them. Think it would be colder here. I mean, this is Alaska. Come back in January and you'll freeze your ass off. I'm looking for a warmer climate. Speaking of which, boys, tomorrow morning we wake up in Hawaii. Two weeks of nothing but sun, fun, and waves. Don't forget the most important thing here... Chics. Do you actually think you're going to get laid this time? I'm going to make getting laid my first priority, sir. You'll pop that cherry one of these days, cousin. Never. Never. - I think it will happen. Yeah, yeah. It'll happen. Ha, ha. Very funny. As you were, gentlemen. I just spoke with Admiral Henshaw. Lukash finally laid his cards out on the table. He's giving Washington 36 hours to come up with $25 billion. Otherwise, he's going to launch a nuclear missile attack against the West coast and Russia. He's not supposed to have nukes. Yeah, well, situation's changed. A renegade security unit seized control of a Russian sub base at Port Yeramin. On the base was a load of SSM 20s due to be scrapped. And a few hours ago, Russian Norsat picked up the Kursk entering Yeramin harbor. The Russians are mobilizing, but they won't arrive soon enough to prevent. Lukash from loading the birds. And that's where we come in, gentlemen. We're taking Bertha here, so gear up. Double time. Let's move. There goes Hawaii. Yep. Brake, now. Stop at the Western inlet. I want a closer look. Mac, Vickers, get wet. Cap, you were right. There's a net down here hooked up to dozens of mines. Can you take care of it? There is activity at the Minet. Handle it. That was the arrangement. Steblin? Ivan. Two small gun ships approach. I count six men. Shooters at 10 o'clock, Captain. Take 'em out. Doc, Hutch, to the attack. I got him... 10 o'clock. Bogey at 12 o'clock. Ivan, can you hear me? Ivan, come in. What's the story? I can report that the six men just coming through the inlet on two small gunboats. They must have gotten past my divers. They got past him too from t he sound of it. I thought you said your people knew what they were doing. They do, my friend. It's all right. They that have power to hurt and will do none that do not do the thing they most do show, who moving others, are themselves as stone. Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow. Shakespeare. Do you know what it means? No. Well, if you and your people don't hold the line, I'll fucking explain it to you. Your attention. We have got visitors. I repeat, we have got intruders. Go, go, go. Go, go, go go, go, go! Mac, Vickers, cover us on go. Ready? Go! Cap! There she is. You want to go first? No. Final positions. Go. Duck! Coming through. Hold! Now! Michael, can you hear me? Dimitri, do you copy me? You ought to read more. On pause. Race ya. Baseball. All right, guys. Mac and I are going in. Go, go, go, go! Drop the gun, Lukash. All right. Drop it now. OK. OK. Just... just relax. Get your hands in the air, slowly. As the poet says, so sweet to live... magnificent to die. Mac! The bullets in the vest. I'm all right. Let's get this son of a bitch. Hurry, Vick. You got to breathe. Cap? Vic's been hit. All right. Do what you can. As soon as the Russians that we're on the Kursk. Breathe. Cap, we're not going to make it. We're not going to make it. You got to do this without us. I got to stay with him. Well, get it through that missile too. All right, boys,. Do a compartment search. We've got intruders in the VLS tubes. Take me to a full stop. Bring me to missile launching depth. We'll launch number one as soon as power up is complete. Breathe. Come on. Your mom's going to be real pissed I don't get you home. Come on, breathe. Mac, upper level. Everyone else take your positions. Go. Hey, Captain. I've got good news and bad news. The good news, is there's a squad of special forces up there. Gotta be Delta boys. Weren't both of your sons in that outfit? The bad news is, I just dropped their leader. Nah, they wouldn't send your son. Then again, you never know. Lukash, that's a load of crap and you know it. I don't know that is back aft, but it's not my boy. If it was him, you'd be a dead man. Excuse me. Lang the younger, sorry about that screw up we're doing back there. Now, because of that, thousands and thousands and thousands of people are going to die. Winger? Lukash. One, two, and three are online. We'll have launch capability on number one in plus or minus two and a half minutes. Beautiful. Listen, there's been a slight change in plans. I want you to reprogramm Merv on number three for St. Petersburg. After that bullshit at Yeramin, it looks like the world needs a little lesson. They're not calling my bluff. So long, St. Pete's. It's got to be similar to overriding the primary firing system. This thing would be my guess, but I'm not familiar with this system. Do your best, Sergeant. Jesus. Make it happen. No, hold your fire. I might need them later. Well, listen, just don't stand there with your dick in your hands. Go get him and bring him back here. "Full fathom five, your father lies. Of his bones are coral made." Now, loosely translated, that means you move against my boat or my men, and I will spray daddy's teeth, hair, and eyes all over the bulkhead. Let's get something straight, Lukash, you're the dead man here. I'd love to chat with you, Lukash, but I'm a little busy right now. Well, why don't you relax? Because number one flies in 75 seconds and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. Good god. There's not even enough time for them to evacuate. You're both forgetting one thing... Delta. What if they've been killed or captured? No chance. We're stationed at fighting depth, sir. Door is open. "Fan-fucking-tastic." It's showtime. Could be a trick. It's not. On three. 1, 2, 3. You haven't called me that since I was a kid. Artillery fire control, should be back this way. Good bye. Launch enabling key, Michael. What's wrong? There's no ignition. There's no problem here. Navy people know about these things. Well, if I'd got into the Navy, I wouldn't be here right now. The must have removed the firing trigger. Well, can we override it? Without the firing trigger, the only chance we have of overriding is to destroy the console in the VLS compartment. You stay on this panel. As soon as you get a green, you launch. This is Lukash. Everyone, seal off the VLS console compartment now. How's your mom and Annie? They're fine. Sailed on to Anchorage. Mike, your people have done a great job up to now, but we're still skating on thin ice. Lukash gets a hold of this console and destroys it, fire control reverts to the bridge. You've got to defend this piece of equipment. I'll be up on the catwalk. Perimeter defense, move. Suna, what do we got? Nothing, sir. If the Kursk is within range of our sensors, it's either drifting or running too quiet to detect with our passive equipment. Go! Get your heads and asses wired together. Now, let's go! Use the active system. But, sir... Yes, I know the danger, Dimitri. Attention all stations, we are going active. We are going active. You all right, dad? Yeah, he's just fine for the present time, sonny boy. You don't put those weapons down right now, I'm going to give him a tracheotomy. Michael, don't worry about me. Shoot this bastard! Drop them. Very good. You're so stupid. I need him. I don't need you. Michael! Michael? My god, son, are you all right? I'm fine. Let's get to the COM. Wait, wait. I don't who that is pinging us with sonar, but they're close. Go easy. Clear! Clear! Michael, there's two of them in there... port and starboard side of the scopes. Both got Uzis. Hutch, Lombardi, take him out. Mac, sweep out, both sides. Check all compartments. Cap, it seems we still got a few stragglers. Got us forward, Michael, let's go. Thanks for that, boy. Well done. Clear! Clear! Captain, I have a faint contact bearing, two, nine, three. Not strong enough for accurate ranging. Fire control, make ready tubes one and three. Sergeant McKinney, United States Army. Captain Lazarev. This is my boat. Captain Lazarev, it's an honor, sir. Come with me. We're going to get you your boat back. Da. This is Hutch. Maneuvering room is clear. Scuttle, scuttle, little roach. How you run when I approach. Captain? This is Captain Lazarev. It's an honor, sir. Thank you for taking back my boat. It was a pleasure. Mac, let's go. Captain Lazarev... Anatoly Lazarev? Captain Halsey Lang, no? 1978, under the Aegis. It was me pinging you. And in 1981, I spent three very frustrating weeks chasing you through the Baltic approaches, captain. You know this Russian radar a lot better than I do. Are we in range of their active array? Captain, it would be an honor if you would take the com, please, and I'll take this over. Captain, what's the range of your underwater telephone? Depends on the type of submarine. But give or take, 3,000 meters. Single contact, bearing one, one, three. Range... 18,000 meters. I see it. I've got no control over power. What the hell's happening in the engine room? He's overriding you. Lukash, you son of a bitch. God dammit! He's cut the power. Petition the Lord with prayer. All bribing with gold. For I am Lord now. And nuclear winters are cold. Increased flat noise bearing two, nine, three. Range... 18,000 meters. Twin screws. It must be the Kursk. That sonar bearing. We have a match. Fire 1 and 3. High speed cruise in the water, bearing one, one, three. Range... 17,800 meters. Two torpedoes. Bearing one, one, six. Range... 15,000 meters. Come on! Let's get down. Lukash is dead. Talk to me. I got ya. That's it? All right, boys. I'm coming back. Torpedoes range 8,000 meters, and close at 50 knots. Monitor and standby. Michael and Akeem, you guys may have given us a fighting chance here. Can you get us out of this mess? I'll do my damnedest. Captain? Cycle range still powered up? Da. Bearing on it's own? Zero at six and holding. Keep an eye on it. Blanes, hold your depth. Helm, come right... zero, eight, six. Now monitor the screen. Captain, how's your Morse? It's all right. Good. Let's go active. I want to ping a message to that sub. Kursk changing course, sir. Heading straight for us. Sir, that's Morse code. Could be a trick. Then why haven't they fired, sir? They've had the chance. Torpedoes have just gone active. Range... 2,500 meters. You're cutting it pretty close. Yeah, that's the idea, son. 1,900 meters. 20 degrees down bubble. 20 degrees down bubble. Easy. The Kursk is diving, sir. Course unchanged. Has the Kursk flooded any tubes, or opened outer doors? Negative, sir. Make ready tubes, two and four. Slight elevation angle on torpedo one. That means two, still locked. Polarize on the planes. Helm hard approach. With counter measures. Captain Lazarev, start with counter measures. Counter measures ready. Strike for the counter measure. It will be closed. All hands, brace for impact. Gents, we need to make a statement of intent here. Captain, let's blow all tanks. The Kursk has blown her tank, sir. She's going to the surface. Close all the torpedo doors. Take us to periscope depth. Yes, sir. Close torpedo doors. Michael, congratulations to you and your men. Job well done, captain. Thank you, sir. By the way, there's someone here who'd like to speak with you. Admiral? You didn't expect anything less out of my son and his team, did you? Halsey, old salt. Good to hear your voice. Norm, can you get word to Ruth and Annie that we're both OK? It would be my pleasure, Halsey. Mike, we've been in contact with Port Yeramin. Sergeant Spars and Sergeant Vickers is gonna pull through. That's great news, Admiral. Please give him our best. Lang out. Gentlemen, hospitality? A little Russian cure for stress? To Delta force, You know there's something else I'd like to drink to? You, son. Family.
