(somber music) San Lazaro, Leprosario. - Stop! Stop or I'll shoot. - Put this in the archive. File 3405 with the current laws. - Yes, sir. - Sheriff! - Yes. - Something terrible has happened. Six lepers have escaped from San Lazaro. - But how's that possible, doctor? That means we're all in great danger. - Of course. Leprosy is a highly infectious and lethal disease. It's also as old as humanity itself. We have to do whatever we can to capture those sick men and avoid them being killed by the townsfolk. But please, don't forget Sheriff, that even when they are dangerous due to their disease, they still deserve compassion. - Yes, doctor. But then what are we supposed to do? - First, let's catch up with them. They can't be far. But please, don't forget, Sheriff, we have to capture them alive. Please be really smart about this and merciful. We have to inform the townsfolk and our neighbors about the dangers of these men, so they won't be killed. (screaming) (ominous music) - It's the lepers. Run! (screaming) - What's going on? It's the lepers. Run! (ominous music) (cows mooing) - Have you heard what happened last night? - No. - Six lepers have escaped from San Lazaro. - The Sheriff and those damn doctors to blame for this. We have told them for years to move that damn hospital. Freaking goddammit. We don't need this. What do you think? - I'm not afraid of anything. I'm in. I was born in a minute, and I will die in less. - Go home Maria and don't come out. Six lepers have just escaped. - This is a tremendous tragedy, everyone. Many years ago, since the last two lepers escaped from the hospital, we've asked the authorities to remove that stupid place from here. But it seems they're more interested in the life of those dead men walking than they are with good, decent people like us. - The only way to avoid getting infected by a leper is killing him. They won't set foot in our town. - Stop, wait a moment. Hear me out. Go back to your homes. - And who'll protect us from those lepers? - Shut up! This man is a fear monger. The one who will tell us what to do is this man. Dr. Ramos, the leprosarium director. - Listen, they can't catch us off guard since we know they are on the loose. As for the contagion, unfortunately that's true. But this terrible disease cannot be transmitted by air. Direct contact is needed from person to person, explicitly through saliva. This disease can also be transmitted through objects, clothing or anything used by a leper. That's why we don't have any other choice than burn down the houses they have broken into with everything inside of them. - But sir, I've worked all my life to have that house. - But sir, it's the only thing we have. - Is there no other way? - Nice way to help us. - If you don't like it, then leave town and stop misleading the people. We will do as Dr. Ramos says. We are going to form a posse to go in search for the escaped lepers. - Please understand that those men are terribly sick. They deserve our mercy and compassion. Killing them would be a most heinous crime. The Sheriff and I will try to get them back to San Lazaro. I will go with you. I know how to handle them. Their disease doesn't allow them to go far. If you are so afraid, you can stay here. - Sheriff, please ask for volunteers. - You heard. Those brave enough to come with us, raise your hands. - Count on me, sir. - I'm going too. - Me too, Sheriff. - And me. - My men and I also. - We have who we need. You will stay here with the townsfolk to keep watch of the town entrances. And you will also burn down the infected houses. - Yes, sir. (ominous music) (birds chirping) - We'll leave the horses here to avoid the noise. We're gonna spread out while we slowly search the fields. Remember to look behind the rocks, trees, tall grass and the ravine. Anywhere a man could hide himself. - Good, I will stay here. If any of you discover something, come back and inform me. And remember to avoid touching them. Understood? - Yes sir, understood. - Stop! This way. (horses braying) Nothing, not a trace. - Yeah, it's as if the earth had swallowed them whole. But we will not give up. We will return later. Let's go. (horses braying) - It's good you're here, Carmen. I want to talk to you. - Yes, dad. - It's not that I doubt the skills of Dario. I know you don't run any risks when you are with him but this danger is bigger. This is leprosy, a terrible and contagious disease, and we don't know where those sick men are right now, or where they had been, which prevents us from avoiding all the things they have touched. - Are you saying I shouldn't leave this afternoon, dad? Let me remind you, Aunt Clavita will be really mad if we don't go to eat with her. - I didn't say anything like that, Carmen. I just told you to be careful. Dario is a responsible man, and right now his problem is those lepers. Go eat with Clavita, but I repeat, don't distract Dario too much. Come back early and I will not have anything to worry about. - I'll do as you say, dad. Thank you. - Thanks my girl, have fun. Say hi to Clavita for me. (crickets chirping) - You know, those lepers have become a real nightmare for everyone. I'm only here because I love you. Remember, close the door and windows. I will see you tomorrow, my love. - Please be careful, Dario. You know how much I love you. (ominous music) Is that you, dad? Dad! Dad! (screaming) - Carmen! (soft music) (dramatic music) (gunshot) - But now, now we are closer than ever. - I know, Dario. In my heart I know that's really true. But my father's untimely death has left me desolate. - Yeah! Of course I understand you feel this way, but you still have me. I will try to fill that void. Though I know you can never really forget your parents. - How could I forget the horrible way my father died? Shot in the back. He couldn't defend himself. The killer enjoyed it, Dario. Those lepers are stone cold killers. At first I felt compassion for them, but no more, no more. I hate them, I hate them. - Calm down, Carmen. Calm down. The killer, whoever he is, leper or not, the long arm of the law won't rest until he's caught, and then he will be punished. - But why don't you think he was a leper? - I already told you, whoever is responsible will pay. And I promise to do the impossible to find him. I know what I'm about to ask of you will be hard, Carmen, but try thinking of our future in our love. That we still have a life to live and a home to build together. - I'm scared, Dario. Extremely scared. - Did you understand me? We can't let fear control us. This is the only way we have to become immensely and filthy rich. Last night we killed Carmen's father and the townsfolk think it was those lepers. - Well, I am actually afraid of getting near those lepers. But Camerino is right. This is the only way to get rich. - Then, let's go. I know where they're hiding. - They've disappeared. - But I know a place almost nobody knows where we haven't looked yet. - Where is it, Camerino? - The Devil's Cave. Let's go. Look at that. Horse tracks. They can't be far. This way. Here's the Devil's Cave. I'm almost positive they're inside as I told you. Make no noise and only shoot if you have to. (gunshots) Don't shoot! We're not with the Sheriff or with San Lazaro. We came here to propose something we believe you all like. - All right, but you and your men must leave. And you drop your gun. - It's done. Now, come closer. (ominous music) - I'm the leader of these people, and they listen to me. What do you want? - Why did you all escape? - Living there was no different than being dead. But we can't call this life either. We escaped so we can die free, at least. - I came here to offer everything you don't have and must have wanted while you were imprisoned. Food, money, wine. - Why and in exchange of what? - Because the world has a lot. We have too little, and you have nothing. Right here to this cave, we'll bring you wine and food, but I'm gonna add my conditions. To tell you the truth, we're thieves, and if you help us, only two of you, we can get a lot of money and leave this cesspool of a town, and you can go wherever, but loaded with money and freedom. We'll split the loot equal halves, and we'll keep everything in this cave, so you can watch over the spoils. - All right, we accept. - Come on in, boys. You two are coming with us. But understand, you must always keep your distance due to reasons you already know. Tonight, we pull off our first heist. - Why did you offer them half of the spoils, Camerino? - Don't be an idiot. Once we have the money, we'll kill them all. Since I started down this path, I've forgotten about my conscience. Let's go. (horses braying) - Don't be afraid, Carmen. I heard about an important person that in cases just like this, helps people in need. I understand that neither the authorities nor the townsfolk can face this threat. So, I asked him for help. - And who would that be? - He's an incredible man. Amazing, legendary. Santo, the man with the silver mask. Defender of justice, protector of the helpless. He helps any and all in need. He will arrive here soon. - Come on, take your chance. You could win this bag filled with 10000 pesos. If you can defeat my wrestler, El Toro. You only have to pay 100 for the chance. Don't be afraid. Anyway, you only die once. Once. You should take your chances now that he's tired. Why is he weak? He has a cold. You see, he looks really sick. Come on, come on, take your chance. - Me! - Ladies and gentlemen, brave man walking, begin. Anyone else, this will be quick. (growling) - Is that all you got? Come on. - All right, step right up. Any other challengers out there? Yes, this is gonna be quick. All right, you hit him El Toro, you hit him. Yeah, this is gonna take no time at all. Come on, people! Yeah, give him a fight. Oh yeah! You hit him, Toro. Down on the mat. All right, yeah. You do that, yeah Toro. You hit him. You knock him down. All right people, you're seeing what I'm seeing. Yes, this fight's gonna not take very long. All right. Yeah, that guys' indestructible. You cannot hit him. There is nothing that can hurt him. El Toro is the best fighter there is. The great El Toro, yes sir. He can take those punches. People, are you seeing this? - Tell me brother Santo, do you think you could help us in taming El Toro? - (chuckles) Why not Reverend Mother? I mean, we can only lose 100 pesos to enter the match. But if we win, those 10000 pesos will make the orphans very happy. - But if you get killed, how will we bury you? - Come on Sister, that's no way to talk about Santo. - I'm only saying it because that beast may cut him to pieces. - Wish me luck. - Yes, that's three against one. He can take on anybody. Oh yes, another one. Yes, another hero. Come on in. Get in the ring, sir. Yes. This is what El Toro is gonna be made of. Nobody can stand against El Toro, yes, that's right. Everybody's knocked down. No one can stand up to El Toro. Yes, he can take it as he can dish it. Come on, Toro. All right, give it to him. Yes. (crowd cheering) - Kick him Santo, you can do it. - The fight is yours, Santo. - Harder Santo, hit him harder. (crowd cheering) - Yes! we'll have a barbecue. - Claim his ears and tail, Santo. - Yeah Santo, you got it, Santo. - Do it Santo, he's almost done. (crowd cheering) - Yes! Knock him out, Santo. Yeehaw! (crowd cheering) - You can take it Santo, you can take it. - Kill him. Oh my God, forgive me. (crowd cheering) (crowd applauding) - You're my hero, Santo. - It can't be. - Yes! - Give me the money. - Are you really gonna take the 10000 pesos? - Moron! - Yeah Santo, you won that fairly. Bravo! - With God's help you beat him! - You were wonderful. - You won, Santo. We did it, God bless you. - Here you go, Sister. Please say hello to the orphans for me. - God bless you. - Santo, they're looking for you on behalf of the Sheriff of Santa Fe. - And there are consequences I warned you about or did I not? They called me a fear monger. This Sheriff even wanted to kick me out of town. You all were witnesses. And now, someone tell me, who's gonna bring Miss Carmelita's father back to life? Anyone of us can be the next one to die. Just look at our dashing Sheriff and Dr. Ramos. Will you allow them to burn down our houses? - No, no. No one will give you such an order. But you will have to listen to us. - And now you force us to listen to you? You listen, having that pointed star on your chest doesn't give you the right to yell at us. We are men... (crowd clamoring) (gunshot) - I don't know what you want Camerino, but I promise you this next shot will be aimed right at your head if you don't shut up and let this people calm down. - That's murder, I'm unarmed. - I don't care, because your actions will bring about lots of deaths. And I prefer you to be the first one. So, you better listen to me if you wanna avoid that kind of bloodshed. - It will be best to obey the Sheriff. - Okay then. You all heard the man. Everyone, let's listen to the Sheriff and see if he persuades us. - That's better. You know we've been looking for those escaped outlaws. A lot of you have come with us but it made no difference. On the other hand, there will be no more escapees because the leprosarium is being heavily guarded. I'm also expecting a very important visitor who will help us solve this problem. (dramatic music) It's good that you're here, Santo. I'm very grateful for this, as well as all the inhabitants of these parts. - Are you Dario? - That's me, at your service. - There's no need to thank me. I hope I got here on time to save you. This is a very remote place. - Santo, near the town there's a leprosarium. Six lepers escaped from there and have been wreaking havoc. - Yes, I have heard the news. - We have orders to capture them alive and return them to the leprosarium. But as you may understand, they are in grave danger of being killed by the townsfolk. - We will have to be smart to capture them. They're stealing because they're hungry. If they scare you, it's because of their disease, but we can forget. They are sick people with the risk of spreading it to all humanity. Let's go. (horses braying) - We are facing many dangers, Santo. The main one is contagion. The other, being killed by one of the lepers. And the third one is arresting them and they tragically being killed by the townsfolk. - There's an even greater danger, doctor. Mass hysteria running among the townsfolk. Those people infecting other poor souls and not being able to do anything to stop it. - It's true, Santo. That could happen too. - What do you propose, Santo? What can you do to help us? - Let me think about it. This problem is not easy to solve. But there must be a way. We need to find it. We will find it. I can find it, but only if you help me. We have to save the lepers and the town. - Forgive my curiosity, sir. Why do you cover your face with that mask? - Listen Carmen, Santo is a great wrestler, an ally of justice wherever it has to be served. He faces criminals and scoundrels of any kind. And if his identity was public, he wouldn't be able to help people like us. - Now I understand. I hope you can free us from this danger. - Good evening. Hello y'all. I don't give a damn about the recommendations of the Sheriff or the doctor. 'cause if I see one of those bastard leopards, I'm gonna shoot them, with the gun right here, between their eyes. - And you think that will be good? - Listen, I don't give a rat's ass about being good or bad. The important part in terms of laugh, heaven or hell will be faced in their own time. But I tell ya, I'll kill any of those men. - Okay, old man. That's fine. (ominous music) (crowd screaming) (screaming) - You bastard! (gunshot blaring) - Move! - Yes, boss. - Yes, sir. - Come on, come on. (laughing) - See, it was very easy. I always keep my promises. Look. Like this here, I'll bring you plenty. Put this on. (ominous music) There you have food, candy and lots of wine. What are you waiting for? Eat, drink, smoke. No, don't touch that one. It's yours. It has money, a bunch of money, but we'll share once we have enough. We'll return to town to avoid suspicion. - Come in, Santo. Please, take a seat. - Thank you, doctor. Forgive my interruption. - I'm at your service. How can I help you? - Could you tell me how many kinds of lepers there exists. - Of course, if you think that can help you in some way. - More than you could imagine. - Then I will begin, Santo. There are two kinds of leprosy. Tuberculoid and lepromatous. - Tell me simple words, so to speak. What are the symptoms in both cases? - In tuberculoid leprosy, the patient has few lesions in many areas with zero sensitivity. There are cases of patients with cigars in their hands, where the cigar burns their fingers and they have no feeling. - And with the lepromatous? - The complete opposite. The patient suffer extreme sensitivity to pain, to the point they can't stand even the slightest touch on their skin. - That means that any kind of leprosy suffered by the patient, will really hinder their movements. They wouldn't be very agile, am I right? - Correct. - Interesting, doctor. Really interesting. Thanks for the information. - Yeah, that's right. (chattering) They aren't helping. - Listen up. Everything will be fine. This man here is here to help us. He is the legendary wrestler, Santo. Hear the man out. - Everyone, I'm here to help you. But I will need your help too. First things first, keep calm. By using violence, the only thing we will achieve is to make those men go somewhere else and to keep committing crimes like here in this town. This problem must be solved cunningly and tactfully, not with brute force. - Until now, we have only received empty promises. - Yeah, he's right. - Yeah, that's true. - But if you promise to do something about it, we will wait, Santo. - Let's form search parties to help the Sheriff. - And what would making new search parties achieve? Camerino already formed a group of men to stop the lepers, and he couldn't do anything. - Yeah, that's true. - I already have plans to solve this problem. I ask you to trust me. - I already searched the mountains with the help of my men, and there was no trace of those murderers. What the town needs is to change our Sheriff. We could put Sergio back in charge once more. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's me. Yeah, of course. Yeah, I'll do it. - What is it? - That's Camerino and his men. - We have to calm down those people and all the others too, or we won't be able to execute my plan. - All right, let's go. - They are coming here. You have to make the fool out of him. - Yeah, you do it. - Gentlemen, good afternoon. - I don't see any goodness, Sheriff. Many people have died at the hands of those murderers you can't catch. - Yes, so far we haven't been able to. But you were out there too. Found any clues? - Nothing, sir. But my men and I have less responsibility than you. The town will be better off with a new Sheriff. - Listen Camerino, this man is here to help us. He's widely known by the name, Santo. And I ask you all to cooperate with him. - Santo, he's more like a white dove. (laughing) Everyone here is a real macho, because this is a real man's territory and we couldn't anything with those murderers. (laughing) You ain't capable of facing me. What am I saying? Not even him. I just realized. You cover your face 'cause you're running from justice. Or you're one of those lepers. - No, sir. I'm no criminal and I'm no leper. My face is hidden for other reasons. - Well then punk, I'd like to take that mask off to see what's underneath. - All right, take it off. (dramatic music) - Come on Camerino, get up - Well, I believe that masked man can truly help us all. - I hope so. Remember, it was those bastards' fault we had to burn many houses down. - We're anxious to learn what this plan of yours is. - I do believe you know how to set a trap to catch coyotes. - Yes, Santo. You have to put a chicken or a live prey in the middle of a deep pit. - Exactly. The coyote comes for its prey and falls in the pit. - Yes, I see but, what does that have to do with this? - We're going to set a coyote trap, to catch those sick men turned killers, for whatever reason. We can only wait. But the sound of the bell will be the signal we are looking for. - Do you really think it will work, Santo? - I know it will. The whole town knows that house belonged to Mr. Tadeo. He was about to open a highly stocked shop. He brought Russians and lots of foreign merchandise, and of course, all the money he has stored in that house. - The news will spread all over town. I even paid some shepherds to spread the news out in the countryside and up in the mountains. - We cannot fail. A rumor like that is heard by all the world, and especially sick men like those who need the money and anything stored in that house. - That's weird. I don't like this at all. The door's closed. There's no lights and it's too quiet. I'm like a coyote, very suspicious. You go first. (soft music) (bell ringing) I knew this was a trap. That damn bell's ringing for someone. Let's scram. - What do I do, boss? - It'd be really hard to get you out and dangerous to keep you alive. - No, no, no. (gunshots blaring) - The trap worked. Who are you? What happened to you? - I was betrayed by our boss. - But if you are not a leper, why were you with them? Where are they hiding? Tell me, who is your boss? - Not all of us are lepers. They are hiding in the Devil's Cave. The boss is... (horse braying) - Sheriff, it's good you came. We now know not all of them are lepers. I saw it coming. And I'm sure that someone is using those poor men as an alibi for something bigger. But that doesn't matter. We have to capture them. While you gather enough people, I'm going to the Devil's Cave. - On it, Santo. - Good luck. - What the hell do you want? - I'm gonna leave you here and catch up with you at the cave. - You're not thinking of betraying me, are you? - No, sir. My girlfriend lives over there. It's been eight years since we've seen each other. - Fine then. Catch up with us later at the old mineshaft. The rest of us will change caves to avoid being followed. (dramatic music) - Camerino! Camerino! We are being followed. - Fall back there. (gunshot) Let's go. (horses braying) (cock crowing) (whistling) - Who are you? What do you want? - It's me. Jose. - Jose? Jose! (cock crowing) - Stay away. Don't touch me, please. - Why? (dramatic music) My poor Jose. - You still remember me? - I never forgot you, Jose. How could I, if you were the first love in my life? - That... That was so long ago. - Oh my love, those memories have been kept alive in my heart. Like as it all happened yesterday. (somber music) - Hello sweetheart. - Jose. - What are you doing? - As you can see, chopping wood. - That job is not fit for your beautiful hands. (giggling) Are you alone? - Completely! My dad went out with Orellan to San Blas to get supplies. - I almost forgot. I have a gift for you (chuckles). - Our engagement ring. It's beautiful. Thank you my love. I love you so. Waiting the few months we have left until our wedding is almost unbearable. - Me too my love. But remember, there are no promises or deadlines that won't be met. And very soon, I will sell all of my livestock, and we'll be together forever. - Way back then, we thought we will be together forever. Get married, have a family, have a home. - Yes. We had many illusions, projects, life ahead of us. But suddenly, it all ended. How could I even think misfortune would drown me in the living hell of suffering and horror? Why was I punished so unfairly? Why? Why? - Please stop, Jose. Not everything is lost. There is still a slight hope, because if we couldn't be happy here, maybe there is a place far away from our misery, where we'll find each other again and love each other. - Thanks for everything, Lupe. Now, you will never hear from me again. I'm leaving, full of joy for knowing you haven't forgotten me. Goodbye my love. - Jose! Jose! ♪ Row whisky ♪ ♪ Row whisky ♪ ♪ Row whisky ♪ ♪ I cry ♪ ♪ Row whisky ♪ ♪ More whisky ♪ ♪ Row whisky ♪ ♪ Row whisky ♪ (sobbing) - Hey, hear me out. Everybody leave, everybody out. Quick, don't leave anything behind. That damn masked man discovered our hideout. Move it. Let's go. What about you? Are you deaf? - I need a rest. - Ah, so you want to rest? Well, rest in peace. (gunshots) (laughs) - Found anything at the Devil's Cave, Santo? Because we were just there and we didn't find anything. Only the corpse of a leper. - Surely, they escaped to another hideout. They felt in danger when they saw me arriving there, and they almost shot me down. Yes, Sheriff. They were shooting from all sides and I had to escape. But I have a new plan. A trap which won't fail us. Listen well. (crowd chattering) - Bank! Attention to all the miners in the region. We now have enough funds to pay your fees. It will be tomorrow instead of this Saturday. For those interested, your bonuses will also be paid. (laughing) - And remember, no matter what happens, allow them to escape. I will keep watch outside of town to follow them and find out where they keep those poor lepers. - Pour us four drinks. Of Course! Good morning, Sheriff. - Morning, boys. - You're in a better mood. - Look Camerino, you don't wanna push me. - They're setting another trap, but they don't know what's coming to them. (laughing) (clamoring) - Fire! Fire! My house is burning. Help! Fire! - Look, wait here. - I'm going with you. - Help me! My house is burning. (clamoring) Help! Help! (sobbing) (clamoring) - The bank is being robbed. (gunshots blaring) - Dario, watch out. No! (screaming) - Sheriff, how are you? - I'm fine, I'm fine. Thank you, I'm fine. Let me be. Which way did they go? - They went south, Sheriff. - I'll follow them. You all just make sure the fire doesn't spread. - Thank you, it's under control now. (dramatic music) - What happened, Dario? - They're gone. It almost looks like the night swallowed them. What do you all intend to do? - Burn down the leprosarium and shoot anyone who tries to exit the place. - Are you all insane? Haven't you thought of the innocent doctors and nurses living in that place who would die because of your actions? None of those people are responsible for all this. - No! What about the men who attacked us and robbed the bank? Who are they? They also kidnapped your girlfriend, what about her? - Wait a moment, be calm. Do you really think I'm not desperate knowing I could lose Carmen forever? That I'm doing the impossible to avoid messing this up? Look, Santo was stalking them on the outskirts of town and he's gone now. I'm sure he's going after them. Have faith in Santo as I do myself. Give him a day. Give us that chance. If we're not back tomorrow at six o'clock, you can do whatever you want. What do you say? - All right, Sheriff. We can wait until 10:00 p.m. - Thank you. - We got everything we need to get the hell outta here tonight. However, our horses need rest. Meanwhile, we'll make sure nobody followed us. That's why I brought Carmen, she's our shield. You stay. If anyone tries to escape, you kill them. (dramatic music) (gunshot blaring) - I came to free you. The nightmare is over. Camerino and his men will be here soon. So don't waste any time. Take the shortcut behind this cave. It leads you to the road that takes you back to town. Try to stay completely hidden. Now, go. - Thank you. - Release them. Don't be afraid. Soon, someone will come from the hospital for you. I will make sure you receive no punishment. And I also have good news for you. Science has discovered a new drug that can cure you. Please have faith. (horse braying) (dramatic music) (horse braying) - What the hell happened here? Who released you? Where is the woman? Gaucho, where's Carmen? - Everyone freeze. Hands up. (gunshot blares) Drop your guns and hands up. - Hands up, Santo. Drop your gun. Get your hands up. (laughing) - Time to die you stupid masked man. But first, I'll see your face. (somber music) - You bastard. (gunshots blaring) - Freeze, nobody move. - Really good timing, Sheriff. - Carmen told me everything. I found her on the road. (screaming) - You bastard! You bastard! (gunshot blaring) - We have to get back to the town before 10:00 p.m. I'll explain on the way. Hold those two, don't let them escape. - One move and you're dead. (crowd clamoring) - Wait a minute. - It's Santo. - Wait, you all have to stop. - Look, right here is Carmen. - She's alive. - The Sheriff did it. - The real robbers and killers were none other than Camerino and his men. (soft music) (crowd cheering) - Santo, thank you very much. Thanks to you, everything is fine now. Please tell me, Santo. Is there really a cure for leprosy now? - Yes, little miss Sulfurs cure leprose definitively. - Thank you, Santo. Thank God. Jose and I can finally look for the happiness we left behind. - I hope so. - Take care. (crowd cheering) (somber music) - The end!
