Get out! Get outta here. What have we here? They ain't no use to us. Might as well send 'em on their way. Oh, I can think of a couple of uses. Get him up. Get him on his knees. Put your hand up on the log. I'm not gonna ask you again. Hold on here. Let's get back to the job, huh? I give the orders around here. You stole a bag of money. I'm here to get it back. That money is owed to us. Don't you interrupt me again, boy. Now where's the money? We used it all. Get his hand back up there. You got nine more chances at the truth before I get your manhood up here on this log. I told you, we... We buried it by the river. I'll show you. Just stop. I'll show you. Finally, someone honest. Take care of that snot-nosed kid or you won't be gettin' paid. No one's touchin' the kid. I may be a lotta things, but kid killer ain't one of 'em. You ride into town, you don't stop for anything, not until you get to the sheriff. It's over. It's over. Comes with the territory, amigo. You've seen plenty worse. Besides, you don't know anything else but killin'. Not anymore. It's over. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen thank you all for coming. My name is Charles Howard. I represent the company that's building this railroad. We are days away from your property lines. As you can see, these green parcels here are the ones we've secured so far. But as you can also see from this map, this is the route that the lay of the land forces us to follow, right up to the Prescott ranch. Now, everyone has been cooperative up to now, except for you and Mr. Prescott, and I very much want to get this settled. We agreed to meet with you here today because we believe our property is worth more than your offer, Mr. Howard. I think there's some things that you don't quite understand. What do you say, Mr. Prescott? Please? Full-time job, huh? Yes, sir, Mr. Prescott. You're a good worker, I know that. Yes, sir. We work here from sunup to dark, you know what, too. Yes, sir. This ain't no place for a boy, ya know. No, sir. What wage you expectin'? Wage? You can't just work here for food, ya know. You're askin' for a man's job, man's work. You don't figure on workin' for nothin', do ya? No, sir. But... Ten dollars a month. When you got it. Ten dollars a month, when you got it. Ten dollars?! Good men are hard to find, Thurmond. And he's already had one offer. I'd say you better hire him quick. I hadn't thought about that. Well, you can start by takin' the curry to the big bay. Go ahead, scoot! Do you understand the concept of eminent domain? The government can seize any property it deems necessary for the greater good of the country, and the railroad is for the greater good of the country. A man's land just can't be taken. The government can have a judge rule that your land must be given to the railroad. I can guarantee you that that price will be a lot lower than the one I'm offering you and Mr. Prescott right now. You people have until tomorrow morning to make a decision. Or what? We know you just hired Mr. Tate and his men, and we're prepared to do what we must to defend ourselves and our land. Don't do this. Please just let him go. The boy's not a part of this. We asked you nicely to leave twice now, but you are still here. This is my husband's land. You can't just... I can't what? Only thing you understand is when it's beaten into ya. Oh, god. God, please stop. We'll stop when you tell me where I can find your husband. He's working at eagle's pass. Now that wasn't hard, was it? Go on, go see your boy. Hi, Luke. Morning. We're almost finished here. Railroad surveyors don't seem to get that we're not movin' and they ain't welcome. How'd Noah do? Real good. ( Horse whinnies ) We warned you, mister. Hard to find good men. Get down there and finish the job. Make it look like Indians did this. ( Men yelling ) I can see why he didn't wanna let this place go. Mr. Riley, I'm delighted to meet you, but I don't quite understand why you're here. Well, my law firm specializes in these types of negotiations. When Chicago was concerned about your progress, they contracted me. Now, what's the situation with these three parcels of land right here? I just spoke with the owners, and those parcels are now in hand. Good. And where's they survey camp? My survey camp is here. Now, I understand a Mr. Prescott has your offer. For the better part of a year now, but he won't budge. Hm. I'd like to talk to him. You're leaving oak hill to Luke and Monty? I am. What's goin' on? Well, if anything should happen to me, I don't want there to be any doubt as to what should be done with oak hill. Does Luke know? No. Neither does Monty. And there's no need for them to know unless something happens to me. Why're you givin' this to me? For safe keepin'. Nothin's gonna happen to you, right, Thurmond? Too damn stubborn to die on us anyway. Don't you worry about me. I'll do the talkin'. Man from Chicago in? Got in this morning. Just what we needed. Let's be clear, Tate. I'm not happy he's here either. But for now, you let him do things the way he wants to. Where do you want him? Take him up and talk to Prescott. What about these other three homesteaders? They want more money. We took care of the last family just north of them this morning; I could do the same to those three. No. Not now. You need to keep Riley occupied with Prescott and outta my hair. What if these homesteaders hold out, and this Riley fella catches wind of it? I don't know, but until I do know, I need your eye on Riley at all times. I don't need Washington and Chicago coming down on me any more than they have already. So for now, what he says goes until I say otherwise. Is that understood? Yes, sir. Mr. Riley, I'd like you to meet my best foreman, Mr. Tate. It's a pleasure to meet you. Mr. Tate will take you out to the survey camp. Um, have you spoken to Mr. Prescott recently? We had a little disagreement a couple of days ago. The survey can't wait for Mr. Prescott to come to his senses. That's why I'm here, Mr. Howard. In my absence, Mr. Riley, obviously you speak for the railroad, and Mr. Tate here works for you. Yes, that's the way it was explained to me as well. And by the way, we're down a man. Can you get a replacement? I have someone in mind. Good. Let's go then. How the hell did he get his britches off? This is the great D.C. cracker? Are you in? ( Scoffs ) Let's see 'em. Well, this is a far cry from Chicago, isn't it? I forgot... Anything could be so peaceful. Yeah, sand storms, rattlesnakes. Freezin' cold and furnace heat. If you're a mile from town, you're a guaranteed dead man. Ain't my idea of peaceful. That's interesting, Mr. Tate. You hate this land so much, but yet, you stay. I'm a railroad man. Railroad's comin' here. Ya know, it's my job to handle this Prescott matter peacefully. Meanin'? There's no need for a man like D.C. cracker. You ain't never met Prescott. I have. He starts wavin' that shotgun of his around again, I want me a little insurance. I suggest you get some sleep, men. Mrs. Prescott. Mornin', Luke. Mornin', Noah. Here's your coffee. Thanks. Well, chores are done, sun's up. You ready to go? Go? Where? Where? Hunting, of course. You told me yesterday... Sh, sh. Mr. Prescott sleepin'? Rifle and shells are on the kitchen table, but hush up now, or we'll both end up doin' chores. All right. Mr. Cracker. Mr. Cracker. Mr. Cracker. ( Groans ) You want some coffee? Where am I? Just outside of Nogales. The railroad survey camp. You came aboard last night. With a little help. Thank you. Who the hell are you? My name's Riley. Jess Riley. I'm leading the survey crew, clearin' the way for the track layers. Oh. You know why you're here? You're here for protection. You're not to use that gun unless I tell you to do so. Is that perfectly clear? Yeah. Mount up. I wanna see where Mr. Prescott's land begins. He's the one that hired you, but I'm management, which means I'm his boss and yours. You take orders only from me. You ever shoot jackrabbits before? Once or twice. When? I never seen you shoot nothin'. A long time ago. Monty says they taste like chicken. Maybe Montana chicken. Cut 'em. Excuse me. Mr. Marsh, I don't believe I told you... Whoa, whoa, hold your fire. You're a little partial to trespassin' on other people's property, ain't you? Put your guns away, gentlemen. I ain't seen you before. My name's Riley. Jess Riley. And I'm here to stop any more problems between you and the railroad. That ain't hard. Just stay off my property. Riley's here to talk, Prescott. I suggest you listen while you still can. And who are you? Name's cracker. D.C. cracker. You don't look like no railroad man. Thank you very much, sir. Well, get on with it. What? Your speech... about how I'm standin' in the way of progress. You seem to know it pretty well. Ought to. I've heard it enough times. This time, I'm prepared to make a substantial offer. I ain't interested. You haven't even heard it yet. Look, it all boils down to one thing... me movin' off my land, don't it? Yes, sir, that's right. Then we got nothin' more to talk about. So what you're sayin' is that you won't move, so the railroad just has to stop. I spent 30 years in this land. You reckon that's not important? Why are you wastin' time? They're just a bunch of ignorant dirt farmers. You're a likeable fella, Mr. Riley, and I appreciate your offer. But you all can go now, 'cause we got nothin' more to talk about. Stop it, damn it. Stop it! Ya know, for such a reasonable man, Mr. Riley, you sure do promote a hell of a brawl. How you doin'? Better than you, I reckon. I'm riding into Nogales. Talk to you later, Mr. Prescott. Where the hell were you? They're just ignorant dirt farmers. I thought you could handle it. You should've worn your gun. Things sure have changed. It's a changin' world. Yeah. Raise it up a little more. A little more. The other side's perfect. Right there. Yes, yes. Perfect. Very good. Newest depot office west of Chicago. You must be Howard's new man from Chicago. You can tell? Few people out hereabouts where suits as elegant as yours. Butterfield's the name. Donald l. Jess Riley. I am the mayor of Nogales and it was I and a few of my civic-minded business associates went to Chicago several years back and asked that your railroad route through Nogales. We were gratified when our small town was chosen. Well, I'm sure that both you and the town are gonna prosper. I would like to offer to help you with the Prescott matter. I was out at his place this morning. Is he gonna leave? No. The only person he'll listen to is Luke rivers. Rivers. Prescott's man. He showed up outta nowhere a couple of years ago. I think I met him today. The only person Prescott will listen to. If he's the one I'm thinking of, I doubt he'll talk to me. Maybe not you, but you oughta look up Jo Tanner. Who's he? Not he. She. She owns the boardinghouse in town, she's a teacher, got a good, level head on her. Might listen to you if you can talk sense. And I don't mean to spread gossip, but she... Where can I find her? The church is also the school; Just south of town if you go that way. I think I know where it is. Thank you. Anything else I can do for you, you let me know. Actually, I was hoping to find a local man to help me with my books while I'm here. Do you know anybody? Look no further. I'm your man. All right. You start tomorrow. I am your humble servant. Thank you, sir. We had some trouble out at Prescott's. Was I not clear? I told you to let Riley take the lead on this. He was. You're reckless. I get the job done. Yes, when you are free to do it, but with Riley reporting to Chicago, you have to use more discretion. So you want me to roll over. You used to ride with rivers. Are you telling me he can't be swayed? Rivers is an ornery cuss. He always was. You're not afraid of him, are you? I ain't afraid of no one. What about the others? Monty isn't much, but with rivers backin' him, I suppose he's dangerous enough. Prescott's quick to the trigger for an old man. The other one ain't nothin' but a boy. You have to use the right kind of pressure on rivers. When he sees that, rivers will see it isn't worth it, and he'll move on, and without rivers, the others will fold. We'll hurt him good. All right, so do it, but when Riley is in town. It's her! I don't care who started it. I'm ending it. Miss Tanner? Harold, stop pullin' her hair, or I will have your pa tan your hide. Miss Tanner, my name's Jess Riley. I'm with the railroad. You wanna drive your track through my school, right? Actually, I'd like to talk about Luke rivers. If you went to him with a message, would he listen? Depends on the message. I understand that he wields a certain amount of influence over Thurmond Prescott. I'd just like him to know that if he could persuade Prescott to move, he'd be generously remunerated. Go to hell, Mr. Riley. What happened? What's the matter? You're tryin' to use me to buy off Luke, that's what's the matter, and I have news for you. I won't be used, and Luke can't be bought. I didn't mean to insult you or Mr. Rivers. I'm sorry. I went to see Prescott this morning, and I tried to settle this matter peacefully, but before I knew it, there was a brawl. It wasn't pleasant. These are the facts. The railroad is coming. Prescott must move. I sympathize with him. But we're talking about something that's bigger than both him or me. You're a schoolteacher. You've studied history. You know that people's lives are often disrupted by new things, new ways. The railroad can benefit thousands. It can't be stopped by one man, no matter how justified his position might be. Do you think you'd feel that way if that one man were you. Honestly, I don't know. Miss Tanner, I need your help. Someone has got to talk some sense into Thurmond Prescott before something terrible happens. I'll talk to Luke. Thank you. Good day, sir. He's knocked out. ( Laughs ) Where you goin'? Cracker! Yeah? I asked you where you're goin'. You want me to shoot him? No. I'll see you around then. Sir, after thinking it through, we will move... If you double your offer. Well, that is not what I was hoping to hear. If we are going to move, the money you have offered is not enough. The way we see it, you're running out of options and time. I see. We're serious, Mr. Howard. Excuse me. I have some work to do. Luke. I, uh, I been meanin' to... I know. I know how it is. I had a visitor today. A man named Riley from the railroad. Yeah? We met. Yes. He said there was a brawl. I'm okay. This Riley fella, he wants you to go talk to Thurmond about gettin' out. He claims he only wants peace. A fair settlement. I believe him. Yeah? Well, he's crazy if he thinks I can get Thurmond to listen to me. What is it? All right, out, out. Everybody out, 'cept you, Noah. Boil some water and bring clean towels. Nothin's broken. He wants to talk to you, Luke. What's the matter, Thurmond? Oh, Luke blames me for what happened to Monty. Know what I want, Luke? Anything, Monty. Name it. I've been thinkin'. Maybe I'll head on home. Good idea. Leaves'll be turnin' soon. Trout'll be bitin'. Ma's Berry pies. Keep on like that, I might just tag along. I think I'll take a nap now. You're sure no one saw what you did to Prescott's man. Nope. So they got the message. Yeah, they got the message. Good. I have another job for you. Those three families have decided you're the one they'd rather deal with. Rivers. You wouldn't have needed it if you had it. You come to brag about what you did to the boy? I'd kill a man before I'd rawhide him like that. You tell Tate his message has been delivered. Comin' here's my idea. You all of a sudden found religion, cracker? That's funny you said that. Just today I was thinkin' the same thing about a fella I once knew. Last I saw of him, he was ridin' this big old roan horse, carryin' a nickel-plated Colt. And just yesterday, would you believe it, I run smack dab into him. And what's he doin'? Pretendin' to be some dirt farmer, scabby ranch in the middle of nowheres. What makes you think he's pretendin'? 'Cause you ain't no fool. Only a fool would try to fight against the odds that are standin' up against you. You keep fightin' for this railroad... I'll have to kill you. Friends oughtn't to kill friends. You listen real good, Luke. If you don't talk sense to that Prescott, all any of you is gonna end up with is six feet of this land. ( Gun cocks ) I'm right here, Sonny. Put the gun down, thurmond. I'll put it down, but it'll be smokin'. He ain't here to make trouble. Trash like him makes nothin' but trouble. You know, old wild bill died with a bullet in the back of his head, holdin' the winnin' hand. Aces and eights. It's a dead man's hand. I'll be back tomorrow to check on monty's dressings. He's leavin' tomorrow. Well, then, say good-bye to him for me, then. ( Screaming ) Let's have a little kiss, sugar. Oh, you whore! Damn, Tate, I didn't get my turn with her. Shut up and bag 'em. Just what do you want? You seem like a nice lady. I don't wanna see you hurt. I don't wanna see anybody hurt. Then don't hurt anybody. To you, life is cheap. You've got nothin' to live by and nobody to live for. You know Luke, don't you? In another life. You wanna talk, tell me about him. If you know me, you know Luke. Ma'am. Luke. Hey, I'm glad to see ya handlin' that gun. You leaving? A man's got a right to defend what's his. It doesn't give him the right to commit suicide. Luke, we all gotta die sometime. But I'd rather it be for something now than for nothing later. Give it up, thurmond. We'll start over. You, me, Noah. We'll head up north where there's rain and good soil instead of dust. You know, when I built this place, I said it would be my last. I buried Margaret up in oak hill, but you know, you're right. You're young, and you have your whole life ahead of you. This isn't your fight. It's mine. Good-bye, Luke. ( Woman screams ) Come on. Who is it? Luke. I'm ridin' out I thought you should know. I guess I'm not surprised. Well, that's that. What happened to us, Luke? Why didn't it work out? You wanted no more than any woman's got a right to expect. I'll miss you... All the days of my life. And I bet you'll come to miss me, too. I miss you already. Why are you doing this? Stop. Stop! It's gonna take forever to Bury them. Ain't no one'll find 'em down there. I don't know. Tate said to Bury 'em good. Help me with this so we can go get a drink. Make sure you get me the right survey map so we can properly record what we find. Yes, sir. You don't approve? Doesn't seem to be my place to judge, Mr. Cracker, now does it? Nope. Just seems to me that you're a better man than you let on. How's that? The other day at the fence line, when the others were fighting, you had the good sense to stay out of it. I do my fightin' with this now. I didn't see you go to heel after the fightin' started, nor after Prescott fired his rifle. Gettin' slow. So where you off to with that surveyor fella? I gotta get on the Prescott land. I gotta do a real survey and find out what we're dealin' with. I think Prescott seems like a reasonable man. What about that boss man of yours, Howard? Is he interested in reason? He's not my boss. I was sent here by Chicago to do a job, and I'm gonna do it. If you ask me, they sent you on a fool's errand. We both know that railroad's gonna go right through this territory. There's only so many paths it can take, and right now, that's straight through the heart of that old man's land, land he don't wanna give up. Ain't too hard to figure how this is gonna end. If Tate had his way, it would end only one way. But the world's changing, Mr. Cracker, and that type of violence won't be tolerated anymore. This railroad is going to bring a lot of things... commerce, progress, but most of all, it's gonna bring the rule of law. Men like you and Tate are a dying breed. I'm no Tate. That might be true, but people can change, Mr. Cracker. 'Cause in the end, if they don't, what's their life amounted to? Good day, Mr. Cracker. Mr. Prescott. Yeah. Monty's gone. I know. Where'd he go? North. Home. Where's Luke? Gone. When's he comin' back? He ain't. Did Luke run away? Get your gear, son. I'm gonna take you back to town. No, no. You hired me. I got no more use for help. Don't you understand? There's a railroad comin' through here, boy. We'll fight 'em, then. A few more like you, I reckon we could. Get your gear, boy. We're through here. Come on. It's done. And they won't be found. No. I heard one of Prescott's men, monty, packed up and moved out. And what about rivers? Rivers has been seen in town with the schoolteacher. If he isn't out at Prescott's, that makes him fair game, right? Tell your boys to keep their eyes open, but make it look like he made the first move, and take cracker with you this time. I thought you wanted me to keep things quiet. Use him. What do you think, Mr. Riley? I think this is it. Good god! Who would do something like this? Indians. I don't think the Indians would take the time to bag up the bodies and dump them way out here. Someone else did this. They didn't want these bodies to be found. You boys look tuckered. Well, wouldn't be if we stood around here like you. Or him. When the hell you gonna let him work up a sweat? Don't worry, he will. You think he'll stick it out? I hope not. That's why you left, isn't it? So he'll quit when he realizes he's alone? It won't be so bad livin' in town. There'll be other boys there... I hate towns. I hate 'em, too. I think that does it. I'm gonna settle up. Run down there and go get Mr. Tate. We all have choices. Leavin' was my choice. Thurmond's choice is up to him. Any notion where you're headed? Just north. So after north, when that doesn't work out. East, then west, I guess. Then south. That about covers it. Pick it up. 'Bout time you headed back up to that schoolhouse of yours, ain't it? I'm not leaving you. That's good. She can stick around here and watch her little hero get what you and that bastard Prescott have been beggin' for. I'm tired of playin' around. You pick up that gun. Go ahead. Pick it up. You got no argument with that Tate that don't include me. Put the gun down, thurmond. This is between Tate and me. Oh, Luke. Don't talk. It's yours now. Oak hill. You oughta take me home. Let's get him into the wagon. Cracker, you're workin' for me. It's a changin' world. Oh, we're on thin ice here. I made the numbers look as good as possible. You're a fine accountant. ( Men talking loudly ) Hey, what's goin' on here? What happened? Let me through. You wanna talk? This is what talkin' gets you. This is rivers' work. Him and that double-crossin' bastard cracker. Men, listen to me. We're railroad men, not vigilantes. Our job is to survey for the track. You bastards started it. I didn't start it, I wasn't there. You weren't either. This was cold-blooded murder. These boys didn't stand a chance. If we have to fight, we'll fight, but we didn't come here to start a war. We came here to build a railroad and to get rich. You know what this is? This is a telegram from the home office in Chicago, authorizing me to pay each of you a $25 bonus if we finish our work here by the end of this week. Now who's with me? Who wants a $25 bonus? Man: I want justice is what I want. That's what we want, yeah. You got some work to do? Let's get with it, Mr. Tate. We should go get 'em. Wow! Monty! I sure am glad you boy didn't start the party without me. You're back. You came back! Shoulda kept goin' all the way back to Montana. Started off in that direction, but along about noon, I got to thinkin', and, well, guess them trout'll have to wait a while longer. Name's monty. Don't think we were properly introduced last time we met. Cracker. D.C. cracker. Didn't expect to find you on this side of the wire. I didn't expect to be here. Where's thurmond? He's up on oak hill. Guess I'll mosey on up there and let him know there'll be five of us waiting on this side of the wire. Damn it all. Damn it all to hell. So, Mr. Riley. What news do you have? I think I found a way for both parties to get what they want. How? It's gonna take more time and cost more money, but this route, coupled with a few trade-offs, it could work. How is that? I traveled the route today with a surveyor from one end to the other, and I think Prescott might accept my new proposal. Good. There's one other thing. When we were comin' back here, we came across some dead bodies in a gully. We should call the county sheriff. I'll telegraph the sheriff first thing in the morning. Okay. Thank you. He found them. I'll take care of it. Mr. Riley is not an idiot. As soon as he finds out you had something to do with Prescott's death, he's going to figure it out. And when he figures it out, you're going to hang, and me with you. They got nothin'. I'm gonna go out there, and I'm going to back Mr. Riley's plan 100%. He doesn't know he's gonna walk into a hornets' nest there tomorrow. And once he does, I want things to go bad real fast. And then, Riley gets caught in the crossfire. You understand? Completely. Good. And you better pray for yourself real hard, my man. I sure as hell don't like the idea of us just sittin' here waitin' for 'em to come. We don't have much of a choice. We'll split up the night. Do watches in three shifts. I'll go first. All right. We'll see you back there. Surveyors are makin' up time. Chicago's gonna be happy. We could acquire oak hill. You really think he's gonna be waitin' there? If you were him, would you want some fella from Chicago running you off your place? Come on, let's go. Boss, some of the men, they're gettin'... Men are gettin' paid. You mind if I take a squint through them goggles, son? Good mornin', Mr. Cracker. Good mornin'. Monty. Take a look. They'll be comin' soon. That they will, boy. Yes, sir. That they will. Luke. Jo. What's goin' on? Noah! What's the matter, Luke? Monty. Monty! I thought monty left. He came back. Why, Luke? Why did he come back? 'Cause we're stayin'. You're crazy. Maybe. But that's how it is. But yesterday you were leavin', so why stay now? 'Cause thurmond's dead. Gettin' killed won't bring him back. No. Then why? You wanna stay, don't you? I saw you at butterfield's yesterday. That look in your eyes. I hope that's not true. Maybe you're right. Maybe guys like me don't change. Can't. I don't have the answers, Jo. I don't know why cracker's with us instead of against us. I don't know why monty came back when it's not his fight. Why thurmond took me in. All I know... Is I've been runnin' and fightin' my whole damn life, and I'm tired. And I finally found somethin' worth fightin' for. Ma'am. They're almost at the wire. They're pushin', all right. Get your things. You're goin' with Jo. No, I'm stayin'. No, you're not. But I wanna fight. I've been practicin'. Get your things! Said I'm goin'! Alone if I have to. Pretty good with pop gun, are you? I hit what I aim at. Hit me. What? Go ahead, shoot me. No. I ain't gonna. I think the boy's a coward, Luke. Yeah, I guess. Shut up. Yeah, look, he's cowardly, all right. One finger on the trigger, and he's too damn scared to pull it. Shut up! See now what Luke's been tellin' you? Hm? No shame in it, son. This just ain't your time, that's all. I hope you both get killed. Noah, come back. Noah! Find him, Jo. Make him understand. Please, Luke, don't do this. They'll kill you. Maybe. Whatever happens, shoulda happened years ago. You better get goin'. The way that kid runs, he'll be in Mexico before you catch him. Noah. Noah! Please try to understand. No!! It's for the best. I don't care. They don't want you hurt. I coulda helped. They need me. Luke did this because he loves you. Because he doesn't want the gun to become a part of your life the way that it did his. Where you goin'? Just to talk. Morning, gentlemen. I am unarmed. Him, too. That's good, right? So you decided you didn't like railroad money, huh, Mr. Cracker? Nope. Just the railroad. Drunk, that's what you are. Just a body scraped up off a whorehouse floor. ( Men chuckling ) That's the truth. Gentlemen, I don't want any trouble today. The way that track's headed, I'd say you're lookin' for it. Are you gonna listen to this? He's threatenin' us. Please, we can handle this matter peacefully. Now where's Mr. Prescott? I have a plan that will solve everything. That's a poor joke, Riley, even for a railroad man. I don't understand. You know damn well thurmond's dead. He's dead? I... I didn't. Do you know anything about this? He should. Him and his friends gunned him down. Find Donald butterfield. Collect your pay. You can't fire me. You're through. I liked Prescott. I respected him. He was a good man, and I'm sorry he's dead. But the fact is, we're here, alive, and I've worked out a plan that I think... I hope is gonna keep us that way. Here's your ranch. House, pumps, irrigation field, barn, et cetera. And here's the railroad, comin' through this way, right through your property. However, I've come up with three alternatives, all of which are gonna cost the railroad both time and money, but none of which should cost anybody else their lives. Now I'd like to avoid this direction 'cause of the gullies. And this way's bad because the Sandy land won't support our track beds. But... if we swing a wide loop this way, missing your buildings and your irrigation field, cutting off this portion of your property right here, which is currently unused. In return, the railroad will give you an equal portion of property adjacent to the land you already keep. Plus, the free machinery and manpower to build your own irrigation system better than the one you already have. That's a good plan. That's a workable plan... For all of us. What do you think? Appears fair. We're givin' up somethin' but get somethin' even better. Not bad. Can we trust him? Yeah. I trust him. I think thurmond would be pleased. Hell with Prescott. What about my men? Three men murdered by you and that drunken son of a bitch. Come on. What are you waitin' for? No!! Stop! Stop! Stop! Everybody stop! Reloading. Luke! Noah! Noah! Get down! Get down, Noah! Monty! Get down, Noah! Get outta here, Noah! You look like hell. Yeah? Well, how you doin'? I've been better. Thanks. Oh, come on. Wait. He's mine. I won't miss like last time. Boy. Change is comin', son. Pick up that gun, and you won't be part of it. But there's a railroad comin' through, and I'm gonna need some good men. Luke. Luke! Hey, you, hang on, Luke. You're gonna make it. I'm not goin' anywhere. You better not. I think we can, uh... I think we can stop the bleeding. No, Jo, I mean I'm not leavin' you again. Some things are worth fightin' for. .
