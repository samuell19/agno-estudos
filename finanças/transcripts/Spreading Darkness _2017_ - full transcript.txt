You robbed 'em to get rich and then you destroyed their lives, but not only their lives, the lives of everyone around them. I had invested all my inheritance in the menzie technology.

You didn't even have a contract with them did you? - I'm sorry. - And Daniella, well let's just say she's a bit unstable on account of you ripping off her brother's invention. - Davis menzie. - He took a long walk off a short roof and Daniella-- - went batshit fuckin' crazy stu. - Formed a split personality, took on the persona of Elle looks an awful lot like-- - Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding we have a winner.

Daniella, Daniella menzie. - I know who I am. - Do you, do you really? It was Brett, he manipulated you, he manipulated all of us. Brett never cared about Davis he used him to get a percentage of his profits, he steered you toward what you became he drove you to do what you did. - But he gave me pink socks, every time I showed up. Who else would do that for me? - Daniella. - All I feel is empty, a void. I see a void. - Are you okay? - He's dead, he's dead there's nothing left. - No-- - we need to take a drive. - Where the fuck are we going mark? - Mickey's get away. - Mickey? Our bass player? - He's got a ranch house, we'll be safe there. He said if we ever needed an escape we could use it. Don't think he meant that literally but. We should be safe there until we figure out our next step. - And what? Start a new life? - Yeah. - Okay, but we're gonna have to stop off someplace first. I'm gonna need a disguise, how would you like a blond wife? I saw a drugstore 10 miles back. - Okay. - Mickey's get away what the hell is this Brett? - Trust me I'll explain. - Brett listen man I just wanna say I've known you a long time but can you do me a favor and admit for the first time ever you don't know what's goin' on? - Listen, I haven't told you two something. But I've acquired some help of a professional nature. I've been keeping it quiet until now. But this help gave me this address and we were to meet here in case anything went wrong. - I'm gonna kill lita in front of mark so he gets to see what it feels like. - You got a point there actually with that one. - That's right of course and we mustn't forget that two wrongs do make a right as in algebra if you study algebra two negatives make a positive or outside the field of mathematics if I was to say I do not not love you, I'd be saying I love you. - I am not not going to kill mark and his wife. - I believe you've got it, I'm so proud of you Fiona. - Ohhh. - Identity crisis, identity crisis, identity crisis. - Okay, it's alright sweetheart I have the bag, just go change okay? - Okay. - There you go, that's it. - Okay. - Take it easy. - Come on man really? I've known you a long time i backed you up with the pink socks with your clients all these outta control, controlling them for you, I've done everything man but this, I'm gonna tell you this better be fucking worth it. - Oh. - Ura seconds. - I mean look I knew what i was getting into right signing up for it and all. - Right. - And I shouldn't be rethinking it now. - I always try to avoid rethinking things. - Study. - I busted my ass lighting that god damn scene. Working that negative so it looked like we were really on the moon you think that was production design? Give me a god damn break I was hiding flaws left and right. It was all me, it's been a while now and I think I deserve a little credit. - Credit's over rated. - Yeah the past is the past. - No, the past is never the past. - It isn't? - No the past is bullshit, it doesn't exist time doesn't exist. I mean think about it have you ever found yourself in the past or in the future have you ever really found yourself in the future? No it has always without exception each and every fucking time been the present. Hello. - Hello. Oh. - I am the ninja of justice. - This is great really I mean who are these people Brett.

Other than that third grade helmed gobbled gook shit see ya Brett i wouldn't wanna be ya. I'm fucking outta here man. She's nuts man. - Do you feel that? You haven't felt that feeling before have you Byron? It's called fear. - Now Harriet you've done a marvelous job. - Don't try any of your stupid mind games on here I practically invented them. Aren't you a little afraid yourself? Now I know stu ripped off your father Byron and your parents Fiona but I think that was small change compared to what he stole from your old best friend Brett. Your best friend and Daniella's brother Davis, oh he was a real genius, such a brilliant mind, he invented this. But stu went and stole his technology and created the prototype himself you see this here is knowledge, knowledge of things that shouldn't be known to the world. I have a little surprise for you. Do you know that stu never took this thing public that if he had Bill Gates would have look like a pauper in comparison to him. But no, he didn't and the world hasn't been altered fortunately. I have a tiny little surprise for you and I suggest you take it. I would like you all to leave and return in one hour. I've a little surprise to deliver into your laps. - You look like a new woman. I feel like I'm cheating on my wife. - Jerk. - This is Mickey's get away. Keys. - I'm exhausted, I think I'm just gonna take a shower and go to sleep. - Okay. Lita thanks for understanding. Your hair looks great. I think Mickey has some night clothes in the bedroom. The last time that we were in a cabin it was our first time. - How could I forget? I love you. - I love you too. - I'm all out of grape flavor so I thought i would pop a cherry. - Darkness spreads. - I must be goin' crazy. - Hey mother fucker. Come here you. You, you betrayed us man no matter what you do no matter where you go you will always be one of us do you understand me? Yeah I should put a bullet right in the back of your head pal. - He's right. - I just want out that's all. - Lying fuck. - Please. - You let me deal with him. - Yeah. - Fuck! - Go take care of that. I'll take care of him. - No, no! - Come on let's go, let's go. Run. - Keep on running lita go, don't stop. - Hold it there mark. - Mark where are you? Mark! Mark! Mark!

No. - I could shoot you right now. I don't really think that you've suffered enough though do you? Do you think that you've suffered as much as Jenna suffered? Maybe next time you'll think twice before you kill someone's sister. I'll give you til the count of five. Four. Three. Two. - No. - Wait, wait don't do it, don't do it. - She. - I know. - She. - Mark I know. - She fucking killed lita. - Put down the rock. - She didn't have anything to do with it. She wasn't even there. - But mark it has to stop. Here and now all this killing all this blood shed it's gone viral. Stu started it and you, you can end it. You, you just have to choose to stop. - Decision time. - Indeed. - I think, I think he's gonna do the right thing. - Is that what you want? - That's what should happen. - It's such a shame, you're released from your contract in five seconds Otto. - Do you know any good psychiatrists? - Alright this is one of my newer songs written back from the time of the Beatles. - I can't wait. - It's called menzie technology. - That's you, that's you. - Take it babe. - That's you again. - Yes, yay, yay I'm gonna, I'm gonna have another drink. - I'm gonna join you i think, I need one or three.
