Alrighty, we're gearin' up to ring in the New Year here at Snow Falls' top-rated radio station for the past 13 years in a row, and we wanna hear all about your past, present, and future New Year's Eves. Call in with your wild and craziest stories for a chance to win tickets to the world-famous Snow Falls Ski Resort. Following a tragic plane crash in the East Hills area, we're still awaiting information on how many passengers were on board the aircraft, but it is believed to be weather-related. ...the highly contagious SARS-like virus seems to be spreading rapidly overseas. On the-- I thought you said you weren't gonna study at the cabin. We agreed I wouldn't study at the cabin, not in the car. Hey, how much longer? - GPS says 15 minutes. - Thank God. You know, not to be the mom of the group, but... that's really dangerous if we wrecked. Em, you're so paranoid. Yeah, well, Kit refuses to wear a seatbelt, which I think is worse. Well, I'm sorry that I like to live on the edge, okay? - Plus, it's natural selection, so... - Natural selection. I mean, people need organ donors. Right, Eden? Damn, River. Is this your family's second home? Uh, third, if you count the one we built in Martha's Vineyard. Jesus. Andy, you might wanna sit down for this. There's, uh, no signal. Uh, you can sometimes get service up on the hill, but it's spotty. Quiet. It's what we came here for, right? - Is there any Wi-Fi? - Put those on the fridge. Uh, okay, so two bedrooms downstairs, three upstairs, and you guys can fight over the ones that you want, and Eden gets the master. Thanks. Hey, neighbor. I'm takin' the room across the hall. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Shot o'clock! Kitchen, in five minutes! Hey, guys! I got a little service after all. Oh. Hey, son, did you make it there safe? Just walked in. Uh, can you-- can you hear me? The-- the connection's weak. - There safe? - Um, uh, yeah, there you go. Now, I know I don't need to remind you, but take care of the place, all right? The antiques. And those are some of your mother's best dishes, so did you buy the paper plates I asked you to? - Yes. - Good. And make sure you tell everyone, no traipsing around the house after they get out of the hot tub before they've toweled off. - I know, it's cold, but guess what? I spent a lot of money on those floors, so... God, yes, Sheila! I just told him what you told me. Uh, just be really careful with the plates, okay? I promise I've got it all under control. All right, have fun. Happy New Year. Dad? Hello? And we're out. I think I ate something. You're fine, babe. Look, you always do this. I just don't wanna be sick for the entire trip, you know? It's in your head, you hypochondriac. Just relax! - Oh, this will do nicely. - Oh, wow. How romantic. Okay, yeah, no. We're gonna-- I don't-- fucking gonna do that. Oh. Break it in later. Alrighty, my friends. I would like to make a toast. Dude, careful. - Sorry. So... - Floor, please. Okay. Without further ado... let's get fucked up! - Whoo! - Oh, cheers. Okay. Oh. Cheers. Mm. Ooh! Ooh! - Another? - Nuh-uh. - Let's do it, let's do it. - Here we go. What the hell is that? I am building the best snowman you've ever seen. That is a very interesting snowman. Well, I'm not done yet. - Dude, watch it! Come on! Man, I don't want snow on my face. Dude, I have asthma, seriously. Shut up. All right, fine, I have no choice then. Okay, I hope this is good content for you. - Come on. - Are you really gonna film this now? Oh. Shit. Hey! - All right, get the shot you want. - Dude, my phone. - Here-- Point it this way. - Calm down. What? Hey! - Can I please finish my snowman? - Fine. - Hey. - Yeah? I'm-- I'm really sorry I didn't make it to the funeral. Don't worry about it. - No, I should-- I should have been there. - Hey, really, it's okay. Nobody ever knows what to say. Honestly, I don't even know what I want them to say. Doesn't change anything. - Canonball! Whoo! - What? Oh! You guys, I'm kidding. The towels. Don't lose them. - Oh, my God. - Okay, Dad. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - You guys were joking. - Calm down. Oh. - Yeah. - Wow. Wow! Coasters, please, you know? Okay. Dude, chill, okay? You're probably, like, one of those weirdos who wears, like, two condoms or something. If he ever had any sex. Very true. But we know he only has eyes for one girl. She's my best friend. Okay. Keep tellin' yourself that. Dude, disconnect. Hey! Look, I have 11k followers now. And only like a third of them were bought. People expect to hear from me. Uh, Jace, that bastard. - There he is. - Hey. Um, excuse me, I didn't ask to be scheduled on New Year's Eve. Yeah, no one's making you work. First of all, you know, I don't really like camping and secondly, the amount of drunk tips I'm gonna make tonight? Worth it. Plus, I heard there's, like, a big storm headed your way. If I got stuck there for an extra day, I would be fired for sure. I just think that you don't wanna admit you have FOMO. I cannot confirm nor deny. Hey, Eden, where you at? Hey, Jace. - A round on me when you get back, okay? - Sounds good. All right, you guys have fun. I wish I was there, but I will see you back here whenever the snow gods will it to be so, okay? Don't drink too much. Or do, I don't care. - Bye. - Bye. Well, on that note, I say more shots. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah, yeah. - More shots. - More shots. - Come on. - Okay. - Shit! What? - Oh, I-- shit. I-- I'm so sorry. Here, watch the shoes. Okay, no. All right, well, when we get home, you're buying me a new one. - Deal. - Okay. So what's for dinner? Stir-fry, and everyone's helping. Oh, you want me to make the "rie"? Mm. Maybe I'm mixing too much? I don't know. I just don't think it's normal that my stomach is always this sensitive. Em, how many times do we all have to assure you that you're fine? Trust me. Med student. It's better than self-diagnosing online. Em is constantly convincing herself that she's dying. I mean, to be fair, last week all my symptoms pointed to cancer, so... I'm sorry, Eden. No, uh, that was insensitive. I know you didn't mean it. - Shit! - Oh, what did you-- Let me see. - Dammit. - All right. In my professional opinion, I think you'll live. Okay. Well, Em, let this be a lesson to you that men do not belong in the kitchen. - Some of them do. - I'm doin' a great job. Yes. He did a great-- great job cutting all of that stuff. Hmm, okay. Well, yay. - He's quite-- kind of really professional. - You can never. Okay, guys, we have eight seconds left till the ball drops. Seven, six, five, four, three... ...two, one. Happy New Year! Yes, Happy New Year! Hey. You good? I'm good. Nothing like New Year's Eve to remind you of how single you are. I wasn't gonna ask, but, uh... where's your guy tonight? Yeah, that guy? Yeah, what happened to him? Um... When my mom got sick, he bolted, so... He couldn't deal. That's-- - That's shitty. - Yep. I mean, thank God for you guys. Planning all this just to cheer me up. I don't know what I did to deserve-- - You guys, look outside. - What? Uh, dude, that's one of my mom's favorite bowls. It'll be fine. Where are you going? It's really coming down. Oh, my God. Okay, remember that-- - Uh, what's that for? - Alcoholic snow cones. - What? - I'm in. I'm in, whatever. Let's do it. Is this... sanitary? - Sure it is, especially with the alcohol. Mm. Hmm. A winter storm warning is in effect in and around the popular skiing destination Snow Falls. Weather forecasters are predicting blizzard conditions, heavy snowfall, and a bomb cyclone. They are advising travelers to be cautious and prepare for delays as two powerful back-to-back storms - produce widespread... - Shit, that sounds kinda bad. We may not be goin' home tomorrow after all. Well, on that note, I'm gonna go to bed. Is that code for "I'm gonna go study in my room alone"? No, it's-it's code for I'm gonna go sleep. Whatever. Sorry. Shit, sorry. It's-- sorry, it's me. - Hey, what-- is the power out? - Yeah. Uh, I went to check the backup genny, but, uh, we're out of gas. Holy shit. Dude, shut up. It's part of the process. Okay, do you think the power will be back on soon? I'm sure, it's never been out for more than a day or so. Wait, so what are we gonna do about heat? Uh, maybe a good idea to gather in one area, like the living room, fireside, and I'll close the vents, don't let the cold air in. If we have to, we can stuff towels in the base of the doors. Yeah? Sound like a plan? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. - Shut up. Come on. Oh! Wakey-wakey, friends! Kit! The roads may be out of commission, but that doesn't mean we are. Come on, wake up. - Dude, what you doing? - Wake up. But the couch, seriously. I walked all the way to the road tryin' to get service. No luck. We should really use the firewood sparingly, there's not much. You can't even see the road. Yeah. We're not goin' anywhere. What could you possibly be doing right now? I'm face-tuning selfies. If there's no service or Wi-Fi, I gotta use my time wisely. "Wisely." I mean, how do you put up with him? I mean, I-- I love him and all, but, I mean, he loves himself a lot. Well, he puts up with my shit. It's hard to find. No! Do you have to film everything? I mean, Em doesn't let me film everything. Oh, Andy spilled the tea. Where did he spill it? What? Oh, okay. Guys, it's-it's dark outside. What are we gonna do for light? Oh, right. I mean, do you guys have any candles? Yeah, my parents have a lot of candles. Uh, I think lanterns, some more flashlights. Okay, great. Then let's, um, let's light this place up. I'm freezing. Yeah, when do you think the power will come back on? I thought it would be by now. Maybe we could siphon the gas from the cars for the generator. Mm, I don't think so. I mean, we'll need it to leave when the snow clears. If. If it clears. Okay, now who's the paranoid one? Maybe we should stop drinking. Most people think that booze will keep you warmer, but, in reality, it does the opposite, and alcohol prevents your body from lots of its healthy reflexes, one of which is keeping the core body temperature warm in colder weather. Screw that. Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up. I dream about my mom sometimes. I miss her. A lot. I'm cold. Me, too. No, I mean, I am freezing, but-- That's actually the last thing she said to me in the hospital. "I'm cold." Now it just... feels like a weird coincidence. Hey. I can't take this anymore. Let's try something. Come on. Come on. Okay, for body heat, right? There's no luck. Look, we walked a while, the roads are really bad. There's no way a car is gonna make it. Yeah, you guys, there's... "snow" way out. Come on. Okay, I got one more. The snow has fallen and it can't get up. You're an idiot. Okay, it's getting colder. The house isn't holding heat. Yeah, and we're almost out of firewood. Is-is this all the dry wood we have? Right, we're low on food, too. We need to ration what we've got. Hey, why don't we cut up some furniture and burn that? Don't even think about it. I mean, come on, man. Your parents would rather you destroy a side table than freeze to death. Nobody is gonna freeze to death, okay? Look, we need to do two things. First, we need to stay as warm as possible. There's a few ways we can do that. Sticking by the fire is obviously ideal and I have a few hand warmers. And, uh, water that was already hot by the time the-the power went out, it should still be warm in the tank for a little while. And I turned off the heat, uh, the power and the water supply to the heater, just to keep what's left as warm as possible. Yeah, and I-I've done this camping before, where you put hot water in a-in a bottle and you put it at your feet in your sleeping bag or under your blanket. Really works. Um, secondly, and, um, this might be difficult... we need to stay awake. Why? Because when hypothermia sets in... most times, if you fall asleep... you won't wake up. Hey, hey. - You up? - Yeah. Yeah. Should give us a little bit more heat... when it's sunny. Could've swore we had more groceries than this. Hey, sugar isn't a good idea. Well, it's to stay awake. And it'll give you a quick burst of energy, but then you'll crash. - Kit, come on. - Frosty, the snow bitch. Told you. It'll only make it worse. Kit. Don't you take adde for ADD? - Have you met him? - Of course he does. That's a good idea. I'm freezing. I can hardly feel my hands. Hey, you know, with most gas stoves, you could just ignite it with a match. Oh! Yes, yes. Hey! Feels really good. Kit! Kit, what are you doing?! What were you thinking? Guys! ...the winter storm is bringing snow, sleet, and ice along with hundreds of flight cancellations... ...road conditions. It's fixing up to be one of the worst snow storms to hit in quite some time. My last one. Okay, listen, I know that Kit isn't the only one feeling a little off. Cold's gettin' to me, too. Plus, we aren't sleeping. Fire is officially dead. What if it's the snow? What do you mean? I mean, think about it. How many movies have you seen where, like, virus spreads or, like, a zombie plague, because the water supply is tainted? Oh, shit. Right? I mean, uh, what if the snow is-- I don't know, somehow contaminated? Didn't-- didn't we pass the water treatment plant on the way up here? Maybe. Uh, and I think there's a military base not far from here. Okay, stop, calm down. I don't think that's it. You guys sound like conspiracy theorists. - We ate it. - What? We-- ate the snow, all of us. My-- my stomach, I-- I knew that it was starting to feel worse. No, no, babe. Look. you-- you always do this, you know that. You get in your head and you ruin things for yourself. Think about it. You were excited for this trip. Shit. Don't worry. I'm sure we're all fine. It was facing the other way before. Guys... the snowman, I think it's... Dude, are you okay? - I-- I thought, uh... - What? Are you guys messing with me? Of course not. Why would you even ask that? - Hey. - Hmm? Do you think it's possible? What? The snow. I think we're all sleep-deprived, probably a little bit hypothermic. Symptoms of both would make sense here. Yeah, right. I have an idea. Why don't we say our resolutions? It doesn't really feel like the appropriate time. No. No, he's right. It'd be a good exercise. Speaking of exercise, um, my resolution is to make it to the gym six times a week, get below 8% body fat. It's heartwarming. I'll go. My New Year's resolution is to survive. I'll second that. Well, while we all agree there, it's a lazy answer. Then you go. Mine is to graduate. I mean, now that my mom is gone, my career path feels even more important. I wanna make her proud. - That's a good one. - Thanks. What about you, River? What's your New Year's resolution? To get away from you people. Em? Hey, have you guys seen Em? I dozed off and she wasn't there when I woke up. Oh, my God. Em! Bring her right here. Okay, everybody back up. Any excessive or jarring movement could-could trigger a cardiac arrest, okay? We don't know how long she's been out there. - I'm here, Em. I'm here. We need to get these damp clothes off her. Gently, okay? Start with the shoes, yes. Hey. Hey, how you feelin'? My stomach hurts. River. Oh. You don't look so good. I'm feeling a little... sick. I keep thinking about the snow. What about it? About it being... bad. About there being something in it. Eden... can I talk to you in the kitchen for a minute? Yeah. I'll be right back, River. I'll be right back, okay? I asked her why she did it. Why she-- why she went outside? She said it was because it was warm out there. She was confused, hallucinating. This goes beyond a little more than discomfort, little shivering and fatigue. Em is literally losing her mind. She's obsessed with this idea about the snow. Yeah, and River's pretty convinced of it too. I didn't even think he was, like, serious when he came up with that theory. That's how mass hysteria works. People feeding off of each other's suggestions, literally making themselves sick over getting sick. Plus, we're all tired and cold, so... Hypothermia can cause bizarre, risk-taking behavior because of confusion and disorientation. And hunger doesn't help, not to mention the effects of little to no sleep. Have you guys heard of the Russian sleep experiment? - What's that? - It's an urban legend. Apparently, it was an experiment on sleep deprivation. In the '40s, there were five prisoners who were put into a room that was pumped full of this stimulant gas to keep them awake. After only a few days, they were whispering to themselves, turning on each other, showing signs of paranoia. And when one of them was screaming so loud he tore his vocal cords, the rest of them didn't even blink. By the end of it, they were chewing their fingers down to the bone, literally feeding on themselves. Why are you telling us this story? I'm just driving home the point that there's no evil snow. We're all just run-down. But I am realizing that we may need to make a move soon. What kind of a move? The generator. No more waiting, no more freezing. Em is sick. We siphon the gas from our car. - I agree. - Yeah, me too. Me as well. How about I go to the shed, look for a siphon, let you know once I found it? Yeah, thanks, River. He's been out there for a while. Yeah. He was acting kinda funny earlier, don't you think? Yeah, maybe I'll go check on him. Thank you. River! Where are you, man? - What the hell are you doing? - We can't spread it. Spread what? The virus or whatever it is. There is no virus. What have you done? We have to die. It has to die with us. We can't leave here. - Tell them! - What is going on? You screwed up! He poured out all the gas, all of it! - What the hell? - River, why would you do that? Dammit, he's covered in gas! - What are you thinking? - I-- I'm sorry, guys. I don't-- Uh, I'm feeling a little... You're just confused, okay? We're your friends. I know. I-- You don't wanna hurt us. I know, I-- I don't know what came over me. Oh, my God. Em's gone. Em? Babe, are-- are you okay? I'm f-I'm fine. Just-- just leave me alone. Babe, you're scaring me a little. Just open the door, okay? Em? Open the door. Open the door, Em. Em? Babe, just-- just open up, okay? Okay, if you're in there, back up. I'm coming in. Oh, my God. What-what are you doing? I think I got it. I think I got it out. No, that's deep. Thankfully, I don't think she perforated her stomach, but I need to close her up fast. There's a first-aid kit in my bag. I'll do my best. Hey, buddy, what you doin'? Cleaning. My Mom will flip. Don't you think we have more important things to worry about at this point? I mean, you're down on your knees scrubbing one of your best friend's blood. Yeah, you're right. I'm not thinking clearly, I guess. Asshole. She can't last long like this. We can try to keep her warm and comfortable, but I can only do so much. She needs a real hospital. How's River? Uh... At the moment, he seems okay. I don't understand how it happened... how he changed that fast. He was... normal last night. You know, I never finished telling you my story about the Russian sleep experiment. Okay. When the prisoners were finally told that they could leave... the researchers heard this quiet voice over the microphone they used to monitor them. It said, "We no longer want to be free." River was willing to sacrifice himself and us... for a hallucination. And Em cut herself open. It doesn't matter if any of this is actually real. The danger is real. Are you feeling better? I think so. I think my head's just a little mixed up. I think I know why you're feeling better. I found the stash in your bag. - Shit. - Hey, I get it. We're all scared, we're all hungry... but you can't hoard our groceries for yourself. I took it because... Well, in case, we ran out of food-- I was planning on-- I was planning on sharing it with you. I'm sorry, I-- I'm sorry, I'll-- I'll share with everyone. If you don't feed the mind, it'll start feeding on itself. I think we'll all think a little clearer with food in our systems. Yeah. What-- What is he-- Dude, what are you doing? We need firewood, River. But that's an antique! Em is dying! I have to warm her up! Stop! Look, we're freezing here and it's because of you that we have no gas! I told you not to do that. Em. Andy. Andy, dude, wake up. Andy, du-dude, wake up. Get the fuck off. Baby... You killed him! I-- I didn't mean to. No... Em! - I-- - No. I-- I-I don't know what I was thinking. I didn't mean to. Oh... Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Jace! I've been trying to get ahold of you guys for days! Yeah, yeah, we're snowed in, and the power is all out, and it's-- it's freezing. Oh, my God, I can't believe there's service. I called for help. Someone's comin' to get you. Oh, my God! Thank God. Guys! Guys, Jace is on the phone! I'm cold. - What did you just say? - I'm cold. Jace, wait, one second! What's wrong? - Oh. - What? Uh, Jace-- Jace is on the phone. It's... it's impossible, there's-there's no service. No, I was just talking to him. The call must have dropped. Eden, your phone's dead. It's... Oh, I don't like this feeling. Like I'm-- - It's okay. - Like I'm foggy. Come on, Eden. You're a medical professional, - trained to deal with high-stress situations... - Come on. ...with a smile and without losing your damn mind. Come on, okay? We can't leave River down there with Em alone, all right? Come on. Thanks for sharing the wealth, dick. I said I was sorry. We shouldn't let her stay like that for long. He's gonna start to smell soon. Maybe not in this cold. Andy was one of my best friends. - I didn't mean to. - Hey, hey, I know that. Em does, too. I have to go for help. You-you mean on foot? Kit, you'll freeze out there. You guys, what other choice do we have? Okay? Andy's dead. Em, she's-- she's really hurt and she's lost it. And River, um, no offense, but... you're kind of a wild card, too. I swear, something grabbed me. Okay. Be careful, please. - Kit, there's nothing there. - I saw it. I know. I know the feeling. Are you sure about this? Yeah, I'm sure. I've lost enough people, Kit. Maybe it's not a good idea. You know how I'm always, like, joking around? But the truth is, I am scared as shit right now. But that doesn't change the fact that I know I have to try. Good luck. I don't think she'll come after you again. Okay? I'm not even sure if she'll make it through the night. The bandage isn't working. It won't stop bleeding. I can't stop the shivering. Maybe there's just a little juice left in the car. Okay? Just enough to turn the heater on. Just a little bit. Oh, yes. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Oh, my God, baby. Baby, it's working. - You were right. - It worked. Oh, it feels so good. I love you, baby. I love you, too. Thank God, the pipes haven't frozen over yet. Well... - Good news. - Hmm? I'm willing to part with my mother's antiques. Hmm, personal growth. I'm all for it. What? Hey, where's Em? Em? - Em? - What's that sound? Oh, my God. Is she in the car? Em... Em, wake up. Eden. You sure you wanna come? Yeah, I'm worried about Kit, too. Plus, I can't let you go alone. Okay. Kit. - Is he-- - No. Why did he do that? It's, um... It's called something... Um, paradoxical undressing. I remember it being really common in people dying from hypothermia. They strip off all their clothes, like they're burning up. But in actuality, they're freezing. What now? We get the fire going again, finish off your snacks, and then... I mean, this is all we have left. You have it. Hey, we can share. Why are you so good to me? You know why. Because we're friends? Yeah. Friends. Hey, that looks like a good firewood candidate. Yeah. Yeah. At least, we'll be warm when we starve to death. Hey, no one's starving to death. - I'll go get the axe. - Hmm. River... Come here. What are you doing? You're gonna freeze. Come on. Hurry. Doesn't a hot shower sound nice? River? River! Oh, River! Oh, my God, River! What are you thinking?! What-- what are you doing? I-- I-- I-- I wish-- I wish-- we could have t-- tried... Hang in there. Hang in there, River. You're gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay. I wanna s-sleep. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're not gonna do that right now. Keep your eyes open, okay? I'm-- I'm here. I'm gonna warm you up, okay? Don't worry. You're gonna be fine. You-- you have to-- to survive. No, no, please, River, don't say that. River, please. No, no. River, please. Please, wake up. River, the power's back. The power's back. We're gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay. Sit here. Sit right here and wait for help. We made it. Happy New Year. I've arrived on the property. Yes, I already see a young woman. Alive. Ma'am, are there any other survivors? Just us. Us? Yeah. Me and River.
