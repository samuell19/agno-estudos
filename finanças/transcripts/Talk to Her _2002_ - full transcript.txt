TALK TO HER The stage is crowded with wooden chairs and tables. Two women come out... ...combining... ...and their eyes are closed, as if they were sleepwalkers. You feel afraid that they may bump into everything. But suddenly... ...a man appears. His face is really sad. The saddest face I have ever seen. He throws the chairs away so they won't bump into them. You can't imagine how exciting it was. A man over forty was sitting next to me... ...handsome... ...and he cried several times, he was so moved. But you couldn't do less than that. It was so beautiful. I have a surprise for you. I went backstage. Pina Bausch gave me an autograph for you. I had to buy the picture, huh? Look. It's in English. But it says something like... ...sometimes you can overcome your obstacles... ...and dance. Let's see. -Oh, she's menstruating. -It's before time. Yes. Hello, good afternoon. Benigno, would you mind staying tonight? My sister can't stay with my children... -... and I can't leave them alone. -What did you come for? -You should have called, girl. -It's not too much to ask? You've stayed three nights this week already. Don't worry, an afternoon off is good enough for me. I have to hire workmen to fix my floor... ...it's a mess. Then I have to frame a picture and that's it. My situation isn't getting better. We can tell them at the clinic and let them decide. It's not your fault your husband left you and your three kids. Come at night when you can, and if you can't, I'll stay. We can manage. Thank you very much. I noticed you stopped integral nurturing. -Yes, she didn't keep it down. -We can start again tomorrow. Yes. Come on, go. Come on. -And cheer up. -Thanks. It's okay. Six bulls and a woman. Next Wednesday at Merced Huelva Plaza... ...Lydia Gonzalez is fighting six bulls. -Six are many. Good evening. -Good evening. Why did you make such a drastic decision? Bullfighting is my job. Two bulls, six. Any number. People say some bullfighters refuse to bullfight with you... ...because you're a woman. People can say whatever they want. It's their business. The world of bullfighting is full with male chauvinism... ...you must acknowledge that. There are exceptions. Niño de Valencia didn't mind... ...bullfighting with you for several months. That is over. Do you think it was all a staging to advertise himself... ...and he left you as soon as he got that? I warned you backstage I wouldn't talk about this. Talking is good, girl. It is. Talking about our problems is the first step to get over them... -... because Niño de Valencia... -There you go again. Lydia, honey, don't be rude. Let me finish the question. Because Niño... I told you backstage I wouldn't talk about this. You didn't tell me anything backstage... ...and I don't like you saying that. People may think we arrange the interviews... ...and I don't, I just go live. I'm one of the few who dare to go live... ...and you should acknowledge you've been pimped. Niño de Valencia has been pimping you. That man has shared with you not just your fame... ...but also your bed. He dumped you when it suited him. Hello, Juan Luis, it's Marco. How are you? I need to ask you something. I'd like to write an article about Lydia Gonzalez. Don't look at me like that, Lydia. Yes, I'm watching it too. ...the audience has the right... I'd like to go deep. ...you're rudely sparing details. Oh, for the Sunday paper? Very good. Bull! Bull... This woman has gone crazy. She's addressing it to you. She'd let the bull gut her if only you could see it. We shouldn't have come. Specially you. Yes, but Niño must focus. He has no time for other concerns. I won't concern him... ...but tell him to come by the chalet to pick up his stuff... ...or he can tell me where to send it. -Send it to my place. -He should tell me. I have nothing to do with you. Here, you can leave whenever you want. -Good evening. -Whisky on the rocks, please. Old-fashioned or highball? Highball. Excuse me, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm sorry. What were you saying? Can I talk to you for a minute? Please. If you take me to Madrid we could talk on the way. I'd love to. Let's go, then. Who named you Lydia? My father. It was like fixing your fate since you were born. He always wanted to be a bullfighter... ...but he was just a banderillero. He was the one who supported me the most in the world. But he died, a year ago. I'm sorry. "El Pais" wants an article about you for the Sunday paper. Do you write about bullfighting? I don't remember your name. I know nothing about bullfighting. What are you doing here, then? But I do know a lot about desperate women. Really? Who told you I was desperate? I got that impression. You don't care about bulls... ...but about my relationship with Niño de Valencia. Tell "El Pais" no. Tell them to leave me alone. -Good night. -Good night. -Get me out of here! -What is it? Get me out of here, please! -But why? -There's a snake in my kitchen. Give me the keys. The door is unlocked. Okay. Calm down. Stay here. Oh, my purse. Thank you. Take me to a hotel. I won't go back into that house ever again. What hotel? The Eurobuilding, for example. Okay. Don't tell anyone about the animal, please. Only my family knows that. Don't worry. I respect other people's phobias. After what you did for me... ...I feel I can't say no to the article. Sleep on the matter. I'll call you tomorrow to see what you decided. Thanks for everything. -Good night. -Good night. Do you want me to stay? I can sleep on the sofa. It wouldn't be the first time. No. I must learn to be on my own. -Hello. -Hi, Benigno. -Hello, everyone. -Good morning. Hi. Are you washing her hair? What do you think? -How was the night? -As usual. Come on, give it to me. I'll finish it. -I'm out of here. -See you. Have a nice day, Matilde. Oh, it's a really hot day. We should cut her hair. Cut it short, it's more practical and comfortable. We'll cut it as usual, like it was the day she arrived. I don't want her to notice any difference if she wakes up. After four years in a coma it would be a miracle, Benigno. Well, I believe in miracles, and you should, too. -Why me? -Because you need them. Maybe one will happen to you and you won't even notice... ...because you don't believe in them. Oh, Christ, it's so hot! I bought a thing for perspiration at the drugstore... ...because it's driving me crazy. I sweat through everything but my armpits, look at my face. -What is it called? -Oh, Christ, "Pespirex". -Yes? -Hi, it's Marco. -Do you remember me? -Of course I do. -How are you? -Naked. I should buy some clothes, all I have is this dress. I can go to your house and get anything you need. No, I don't want anything from there. There will be time. -Where are we going? -To Sibila. -You must think I'm crazy. -Why? Because I don't want to go home anymore. No, I understand it. When me and my wife split... ...I could no longer sleep in the same bed... -... so I slept on the couch. -Really? I slept there for over a week... ...until I decided to buy a new bed. So you are separated. I'm alone. A FEW MONTHS LATER Marco, we must talk after the bullfight. -We've been talking for an hour. -You have. Not me. That's true. Did you read about the nun? The one who was raped by missionaries in Africa. By the priests themselves. It's terrible. If you can't trust the missionaries, who can you trust? They used to rape the natives. Really? They're afraid of AIDS, so now they're raping their own. Terrible... I used to think very high of missionaries. There must be all kinds of them. -They are not all rapists. -I hope so. -No, some are pedophiles. -What is that? The issue of fucking has no remedy. Be quiet, Antonio. Don't be stupid. -How will the bullfight be? -Very nice, but fat. -How much will it weight? -Over a thousand pounds. Jesus! Well, I'm leaving. Lydia, remember we'll have dinner at home tonight. The kids really want to see their aunt. Good luck. The bull's coming. Calm down, girl. Come on. Good afternoon. -How is she? -She's very ill. The bull split her in half. My father must be happy now. "Not the girl... not the girl." My mother and I would tell him once and again. But the girl was exactly like him. Don't be mad, girl. What time is it? It's been four hours. THREE WEEKS LATER -Are you leaving to Cordoba? -Yes. I'd like to stay, but I can't. The doctors say there's nothing else to do. Our bar has been closed for three weeks. The children are with a neighbor. I've neglected them. Don't worry, if anything happened... ...you could be here within 2 hours. -You can be sure about that. -We must keep the faith. -Faith? -Yes. I keep on lighting candles for my saints... ...but it's very hard for me to have faith. When do you think we can put her medals on? Not yet. Because of everything she has... ...the wounds, the tracheotomy... No. She never took them off. -Hello. -Hello. -I'll go get a vase. -Thank you. I have to go to America for three months. My agent says it is very important... ...but... ...the way things are... ...I don't want to go. Can you step out for a minute? You can't smoke in here. Did she talk to you before the bullfight? Yes. Well, in fact, I talked. What did you talk about? My stuff. Didn't she tell you something about me? The truth is, Lydia hadn't talked about you for long. What happened to her is my fault. No, it was my fault. They say that he spent the nights... ...just crying. They say that he didn't eat... ...he just spent his time drinking. They swear that the sky itself... ...trembled when it heard him crying. He so suffered for her... ...that he even called her as he laid dying. "Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay"... ...he sang. "Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay"... ...he moaned. "Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay"... ...he sang... ...of a deadly passion... ...he was dying. That a sad dove... ...goes and sings for him early in the morning... ...to the little lonely house... ...with its little doors... ...opened wide. They swear that dove... ...is nothing but his soul... ...that he is still waiting... ...for that poor wretch to come back. "Cu-cu-rru-cu-cu"... ...dove... ..."cu-cu-rru-cu-cu"... ...don't cry. The stones never will... ...dove... ...what can they know... ...about love? This Caetano has given me goose-bumps. Marco, I've always wanted to ask you. Why did you cry the night I met you... ...after hunting that animal? It brought me a lot of memories. What memories? I had to hunt another snake years ago. We were in Africa. She had the same phobia you do. She waited outside the tent, terrified... ...defenseless... ...and completely naked... ...because she had discovered the animal while we slept. Was it the same woman for whom you slept in the couch? I hate that woman. No... I haven't seen her in years. Even worse. What can I do for you to forget her? Exactly what you're doing. You were fast asleep, we didn't want to wake you up. -Is Dr. Vega here? -He must be in his office. I saw him arrive. -Good morning. -Good morning. Rosa, close the door, there's an air current! Oh, you opened your eyes. -That gives me the creeps. -What when they yawn? Oh, I shit my pants. Good morning, doctor. I want to talk to you. Sure. How are you? How did you spend the night? I'll buy you a cup of coffee. Doctor... how long can Lydia remains like that? Months, years. For the rest of her life. Is there no hope? As a doctor I must tell you there isn't. However... RESURRECTED "Meryl Lazy Lee Moon wakes from a coma after 15 years." She went into a coma after her third childbirth. Meryl was in a persistent vegetative state... ...just like Lydia, in theory, unconscious for life. Her waking up contradicts everything I'll tell you. This means that there is hope. No, I insist, scientifically, there isn't. But if you think so, I won't take your hope away. Can she open her eyes or am I hallucinating? Yes, she can open her eyes... ...but it doesn't mean she's looking at you... ...or noticing anything. Lydia's cerebral cortex is completely devastated. However, her cerebral stem is intact. It controls automatic functions... ...like breathing, sleeping, intestinal movement. She can open her eyes as a mechanical act. Her brain is off, it can't conceive ideas or feelings. Come in. Hey, you... come in, come in. Yes, you. Hello. -My name is Benigno. -Marco Zuloaga. She is Alicia. Is this the first night you've stayed here? -Yes. -The first is the worst. You get used to it. What are those boots for? This is for her feet not to bend sideways... ...or fall forward. They look like Ibizan boots. Really? I've never been to Ibiza. I know you. Have you read something I've written? No, no, no. It was during the performance of "Caffe Muller". We were sitting together, by chance. I didn't notice. At a certain point... ...you couldn't hold back your tears. He's the man I told you about. The one I saw cry while watching "Caffe Muller". Well, I have to go. Are you leaving? So soon? We haven't talked about anything yet. -Some other time. -Will you come back today? -Yes. -Then come and visit us. I never leave, and I spend many nights here. I'm a veteran nurse, you can count on me. -Thank you. Bye. -See you. -Mr. Roncero. -Good morning. Good morning. Do you want me to call Dr. Vega? No, go on with what you're doing. The other day... ...going through my stuff... ...I found a notebook with some data... ...about the day that you went to see me. I had written down a subject... ...that we'd discuss on your second appointment. You never had a second appointment. What subject? Your... sexual orientation. My sexual orientation? Yes, your sexuality. Whether you are attracted to men or women. When you went to see me you told me... ...that you were a virgin then. Well... ...answering your question... ...I think my orientation is towards men. Is that why you went to see me? Well, I don't remember now. But I guess... I guess. -But I am very well now. -Are you with someone? More or less. I'm no longer alone. I don't have that problem anymore. I hope you didn't mind my question. No, no, not at all. -Her father came, didn't he? -Yes. -He asked me if I was gay. -Really? Well, we used the American way, more subtle. He asked what my orientation was. -What did you tell him? -That I like men. Is it true? No, you fool. I lied to him. How dare he ask me whether I like men or women? -Who cares? -I don't. I don't like knowing. Have I asked the chief nurse if she's gay? Or do I ask you if you like bestialism or coprophagy? No, you're right. One shouldn't ask that. Maybe I'll have to travel... ...so I won't be able to come every week. But I've been offered a creation in Geneva... ...a choreography, and that makes my heart beat. I have an old idea for a ballet. It's called "Trenches". It's about the First World War. Problem: I'd need many boys... ...many dancers because, of course... ...there are many soldiers in war. But in Geneva everyone dances. It's wonderful. There are also female dancers because, you see... ...in ballet, when a soldier dies... ...his soul emerges from his body. His ghost does. And that's what it is: a female dancer. Long, white tutu, like the dancers in "Giselle", classic... ...but stained with blood... ...red. -That's beautiful. -Yes. -Alicia's loving it. -Beautiful, because... ...from death... life emerges. From the masculine, the feminine emerges. Of course... From the earthly... ...emerges... -... the beach. -No. From the earthly... Water emerges. No... the ethereal emerges. Oh... right. From the earthly the ethereal emerges... ...the untouchable, the ghastly. And I have the music. From Krystof Penderesky... ...the piece for the victims at Hiroshima. Second World War, it doesn't matter. Of course it doesn't! Alicia remembers perfectly. Yes, that's the music for the battle. It's brutal, savage... ...and the music for the deaths... ...is a masterpiece... ...that you will listen to right now. You are going to flip. Alicia... ...good-bye. Take care. And you take care, Katerina. Though you look gorgeous. You must stage "Trenches". I will. -Take care of her. -Yes, of course. Good-bye. Look. We will put this by the window. You'll watch your friends dance across the street. And look. I love this bedroom. I'll have it made, all of it. And... Hello. Come in and close the door, please. -How are you? -Hi, Benigno. -Take a seat. -Thanks. Alicia, look who's here. We were breathing some air, reading some magazines... Were you? Hey, who is that woman who just left? Katerina, Alicia's teacher. -Her teacher? -Her ballet teacher. Yes, she's quite a character, Katerina. He has a dance school right in front of my house. Alicia was her student. Katerina loves her as if she was her daughter. FOUR YEARS EARLIER Benigno, you've been at the window for half an hour. I'm coming, mom. I'm going home. -Take care. -Bye. See you tomorrow. What is it? Are you following me? No. Well, yes. And? I think this is yours. It must have fallen... -Thank you. -Is everything in it? -Yes. -I didn't touch anything. Thank you. -Where are you going? -Home. Do you mind if I walk with you? I have nothing to do. Okay, but I'm going home. Yes, sure. It suits me. I wouldn't live without dancing. I enjoy very much watching it. Do you like ballet? I guess. Yes, sure. But I have never seen anything. What else do you do? Besides dancing. Well, I love to travel... ...and I go to the movies very often. Lately I've discovered silent movies. They're my favorite, I love them. -Silent movies? -Yes. Where do you hang out? -I don't. -You have to, some time. No, I had been taking care of my mother... ...but she died two months ago. I'm sorry. Mine died too, but long ago. Well, we're here. Thanks about the wallet. Dr. Roncero, psychiatrist. Seventh floor, left. Twenty three. If I stayed all day by the window... ...she didn't come to class. But I remembered her address... ...and that her father was a psychiatrist. Dr. Roncero's office. I want to get a consultation... -... an appointment. -Is tomorrow at 5 okay? Can't it be sooner? No. Tomorrow at five. -Okay. -Give me your name. -May I help you? -I have an appointment. -At five. -Come in. Come in, don't stand there. Excuse me. -Benigno Martin? -Yes. I need your data. Birth? I just wanted to see Alicia again... ...but since the father was there and he was a psychiatrist... ...I told him I missed my mother. For the last 15 years, you say? Yes. I've been taking care of her since I was almost a kid. During these past 15 years... ...you did nothing but take care of your mother. I never left her side. Well, I studied to be a nurse... ...and I had to go out to go to school. I also studied esthetics... ...make-up and hairdressing... ...but I did that by mail. Do you mean that you put make-up on your mother... -... that you did her hair? -Sure. Yes, I cut her hair, dyed it, gave her manicures... ...I massaged her, front, back. My mother wasn't disabled, nor crazy. She was just a little lazy, you know. My mother was a very beautiful woman. I didn't like to see her untidy. What did your father say about it? -Nothing, what could he say? -Is he dead? No, Christ! No. He lives in Sweden. I guess, because... I haven't heard from him in years. Does he never come to see you? No. No, he's had a new family for some time now... ...when he left my mother. We don't have a relationship. Why did you come to see me, Benigno? -Well... -What is your problem? I have no problem. There most be something if you came to see a psychiatrist. Well, loneliness, I guess. Have you ever had sex with a woman? No. And with a man? Not either. I'd like you to come and see me next week. -Is there something wrong? -No... ...but... ...you've had a... let's say... -... special adolescence. -Not that special. Yes, very special. Well, whatever you say, yes. We should make a deeper analysis. Yes, sure, let's analyze it. I'll come next week, then. Okay. -Well, nice to meet you. -Good-bye. See you. -What are you doing here? -Nothing, I was leaving. Don't get nervous. I just wanted to see you. But I'm harmless. Dr. Roncero's office. Hello, Lola. Yes, I just shit the largest thing. One... ...and two... ...and three... stay forward. And one... ...and two... and three... ...stay back. An accident? Can you cover for me? Alicia never went back to the dance school. I didn't want to scare her again... ...so I only went back to her home a week later... ...like I had told the father. It didn't stop raining all week. The next time I saw her was here. What happened to her? A car accident. One of those rainy days. Her father didn't want her to be alone for a minute... ...night or day. He asked for the best nurses... ...and well, I have a great reputation here... ...and I was recommended. When he saw me he remembered that we had met... ...and he doubted for a minute, but... ...finally he hired Matilde and me, exclusively. It's four years now... ...and here we are. Right, Alicia? I started going to watch ballet on my free days. I also go to the movies. I watch as many silent movies as I can: German, American, Italian, all of them. Then I tell her all that I've seen. These last four years have been the richest of my life... ...taking care of Alicia... ...and doing the things she liked to do. Except traveling, of course. For me it's the opposite with Lydia. Why is that? I don't even dare to touch her. I don't recognize her body. I'm unable even to help the nurses turn her in bed... ...and I feel very mean. Talk to her. Tell her. Yes, I'd like to, but she can't hear me. How can you be so sure they can't hear us? Because her brain is off, Benigno. A woman's brain is a mystery... ...even more the state they're in. Women must be taken into account. Talk to them, have some detail once and again... ...caress them at times... ...remind them that they exist, they're alive... ...and that we care. That's the only therapy, I talk through experience. How experienced are you with women? Benigno... ...how experienced are you with women? What? I asked how experienced are you with women? As much as I can be! I lived with one for 20 years and four with this one. Well, I love the bullfighter's boyfriend. I'm sure he has a big cock. How do you know that? Have you seen it? -Cookies? -Thanks. That kind of thing shows in their faces. In their faces... and mostly in their crotch. Well, I have a sixth sense. He and Benigno have become very good friends, right? Yes. Do you think he's gay too? No way. What a thing to say. Are you saying Benigno is gay? Am I saying it? It's vox populi, baby. -You're very wrong. -Dr. Vera says I'm right. -How could he know? -Alicia's father told him. I don't like him acting so freely with the sick girl... ...but Dr. Vega told me not to worry... ...that Benigno isn't attracted to women, but to men. You're so mean. I'm leaving so you can talk at ease. This poor girl has a crush on Benigno. I wish her luck. -Hello. -Hello, Benigno. Tonight is my free night, I'm going to the movies. I must go back to work one of these days. This woman isn't right. Benigno, please. Man, understand. Poor girl, her skin is dry. Let's see... Here. Have you talked to her? No, and don't insist. Okay. Bye, Lydia. You must be very patient with him. Well... ...have a nice day. DORE THEATER "Waning lover." Rosa has the flu. I hope you didn't catch it. I'm glad you are fine. Even so, I'll massage you... ...and rub rosemary alcohol on you. No... No, there's nothing wrong with me. It's just that... last night I saw a movie that... ...that disturbed me. It's a love story... ...between Alfredo, a chubby boy, like myself... ...but a good guy... ...and Amparo, his girlfriend... ...who is a scientist. Amparo is experimenting with a diet formula... ...which will be a nutritional breakthrough. "YOU'RE SO SELFISH... YOU ONLY THINK OF YOURSELF" "I'VE GOT IT!" "It may be dangerous, I Haven't tested it in humans." "Do you still think I'm selfish?" "It made me feel so good!" "Don't worry honey! I'll find an antidote!" But time went by. Amparo worked hard, but she didn't find an antidote... ...and poor Alfredo waned day by day. "Don't look for me. I'll always love you." Alfredo left to keep her from suffering. He abandoned Madrid... ...and went back to his mother's... ...with whom he hadn't spoken in 10 years... ...because she was something! He hadn't even told Amparo where she lived. In the movie, many things happen... ...but the important thing is... ...that after years... ...of remorse and study... ...Amparo discovers... ...Alfredo's mother's address... ...and she shows up there. "... don't feel guilty." "... freely and because I love you..." YOUKALl HOTEL ROOM 15 -SLEEP, HONEY. -WHAT IF I CRUSH YOU? And Alfredo... ...stays inside of her... ...forever. A MONTH LATER Let's see, give me your hands. Like that... like that... ...like that. Oh, it's cool out here! How nice! Oh, being on the terrace is so nice! Isn't it? And Lydia likes being taken out too. Right, Lydia? You heard her, she loves it. Look at them. It looks like they're talking about us. What do you think they'd talk about? Because these girls are shameless. Women tell each other everything. Everything. Lydia would tell her it's 2 months since the bull got her. Come on, walk. Benjamin and Angela... ...have you come to be married without being forced... ...by your own free will? -Yes, we come freely. -Yes, we come freely. Therefore, since you want to be joined in holy matrimony... ...take each other's hands... ...and express your consent before God and His church. I, Angela, want you, Benjamin... ...to be my husband... ...and I give myself to you... ...and I promise to be faithful... ...in happiness and in sorrow... ...in sickness and in health... ...every day of my life. Our Lord, who had love be born between you... ...may confirm this mutual consent... ...that you have expressed before His church. What God has joined should not be severed by man. What are you doing here? I thought we'd meet at the hotel. I changed my mind. I have always liked weddings. Weren't you going to see your sister before the bullfight? I called her, she'll come to the hotel. I had to promise her we'd have dinner at her bar tonight. Whatever you want. -... through the Holy Church... -Nice ceremony, isn't it? Lovely. I didn't think she was so young. I guess you came because you didn't know. Marco, I came because I don't want another day to finish... ...without us talking. You don't have to worry. I'm over Angela. I have proofs. For example, I didn't cry during the ceremony, you did. -Right. -There's no reason. -You don't believe me? -That's not it. It took me a decade to get over her... ...but I swear it's over. -Marco... -Lydia, believe me, it's over. Angela and I traveled a lot. The excuse was writing a tourist guide... ...about some exotic place... ...but I was really keeping her away from drugs... ...running away from Madrid. Life in Madrid was Hell. Our relationship worked only running away. After trying for 5 years and 7 tourist guides... ...I brought her here, to Lucena, with her parents. They got her away from drugs and me forever. Did you still love her? Yes. That's why I cried when I saw something moving... ...because I couldn't share it with her. There's nothing worse than being away... ...from someone you still love. What a sad story. "Love is the saddest thing in the world when it's over"... ...says a Jobim song. Marco, we must talk after the bullfight. We've been talking for an hour. You have. Not me. That's true. The doctor told me my leg will take... ...at least two months to heal. But, you know? I'm glad that bull got me. This way I can stay with you until you awake, my love. No one will take me away from you. We were back together. We had been together for a month. Lydia went to the wedding to tell you... ...but when I saw you I knew she hadn't told you. It was you she was crying for at the wedding. She called me from the restaurant... ...to tell me she had cried thinking of me. That's the last time we talked. I'm injured, so I won't bullfight for a while. If you don't mind, I'd like to stay with her these nights. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Hi, Alicia. I'm alone again. I caught you looking at her bosom, don't deny it. It's hard not to, it's larger every day. Benigno, I think I'm going on a trip. Why is that? -I have to work. -What about Lydia? Lydia no longer needs me. Have you two split up? It's a way of putting it. You know, Marco? I figured it out. I don't know how, but I figured it out. There was something about your relationship, I'm sorry... ...that wasn't working. When are you leaving? In a couple of days, but I'll see you before that. I hope so. I'm sorry that you're leaving. -Hello, Rosa. -Hello, Marco. Well, I'm leaving. Benigno, see you soon. -Sure. -Bye, Rosa. Ciao. Benigno, is she menstruating already? No. I'm reading last month's notes... ...and she should be menstruating already. Yes. She's a little late. NURSE'S GRAPHICS It's been over too weeks. She's too late. Are you sure she had it last month? I placed the sanitary napkin myself. It was the week that you had the flu. She even looks swollen. Come on, sometimes they are out of order. Lydia, for example, is no longer menstruating. I see. Still we should tell Dr. Vega. Hello, Benigno. Hello. I brought some of my tourist guides for Alicia and you. Thanks a lot. I've said good-bye to Lydia. I tried to see Alicia, but the head nurse and Dr. Vega... ...didn't let me in. Is something wrong? No, I think Alicia has an infection. Can you give me a ride home? I don't have to stay tonight. I hope it's nothing serious. I don't know, man. They're making some tests... ...but they haven't told me anything either. Abidjan, Yemen, Brazil... ...Turkey, Cuba. -I'll read them to Alicia. -It's just tourist guides. If you wrote them I'm sure they have style. Are you leaving alone? Yes. I wanted to talk to you about that, Marco... ...before you leave. About what? About loneliness. I want to get married. Marry? Who? -Alicia, who else? -Benigno, you're insane. Our relationship is better than most marriages. What's wrong with a man in love wanting to get married? She is in a coma! Alicia can't say "I do" with any part of her body. We don't know if vegetative life can be called life! -Get in the car. -How can you say that? Get in the car! Benigno, what you have with Alicia is a monologue... ...and nonsense. Talking isn't useless... ...but you also talk to plants and you don't marry them. I can't believe you're saying that. I thought you were different. Promise me you won't say it again, won't even think it again. -Promise. -Why? Because if you tell someone you'll be in serious trouble... ...and I won't be here to help you. If it makes you easy, I promise. No matter how much we love her and like her... -Do you like her too? -Of course I do, how couldn't I? She likes you too. Benigno, Alicia is practically dead! She can't feel anything for anyone! Not for me, for you, not even for herself! Get that into your head! Our patient Alicia Roncero has been raped... ...and she is pregnant. I haven't told her father yet... ...because you'll tell me first who was the son-of-a-bitch. Mr. Director, we are greatly disturbed. You should feel responsible instead. Alicia is on your floor. Then let me expose this situation. Rosa, please. Alicia hasn't had her period for two months. First I thought it had just been a month, but... ...but I was wrong. Last month's nurse's comments say nothing about it. It even says you placed the sanitary napkin as usual. That week I was home with a flu. You wrote it, didn't you, Benigno? -It's your handwriting. -Yes, I did. Why did you write false data? I didn't want people to be alarmed. It's not the first time a patient no longer has her period. That's true. How come no one noticed? What about the night nurse? Matilde? She called, she can't make it today. Didn't she notice it was missing either? Well, Matilde has been having personal problems. It's very often that she can't come. Who takes her place? Benigno. Do you want me to tell Mr. Roncero... ...his daughter spends day and night with this freak? Please, stay calm and be respectful. Benigno... ...do you realize you have become the prime suspect? Why did you hide it the first time it was missing? I'm sure there is an explanation. You would never harm Alicia. -You can be sure of that. -And so? Last night, at the parking lot, I happened to hear... ...a conversation between Benigno and Mr. Marco. Benigno said he wanted to marry Alicia. Mr. Zuloaga tried to dissuade him, but... ...Benigno wasn't reasoning, he was very upset. He also said he knew many married couples... ...who didn't get along as well as he and Alicia did. JORD ANIA, EIGHT MONTHS LATER Lydia Gonzalez was buried yesterday, April 13th... ...at La Almudena cemetery. The 33-year-old bullfighter... ...daughter of banderillero Antonio Gonzalez... ...had been in a coma... Del Bosque Hospital, may I help you? Can I speak to Benigno Martin? -He's on the second floor. -He doesn't work here anymore. -Excuse me, Miss... -Are you sure? Absolutely. What about nurse Rose Salazar? -Who am I speaking with? -Marco Zuloaga. Hold on a second. How can I authorize some flyers? Down the aisle, in Administration. -Yes, who is it? -Marco Zuloaga. -Marco... -I'm calling from Jordanian. I read that Lydia is dead. Yes, man, she is. I'm sorry, Marco. I would have liked to be informed. I see. I don't know, we've had so many problems... What is it, Rosa? They told me Benigno isn't working there. No. Benigno is in jail. In jail? Why? He's accused of raping Alicia Roncero. What are you saying? Give him a hand. He has no one to turn to. -Have you visited him? -Me? After what he did, I can't. But someone must help him and you're his friend. Okay. Which prison is he in? Segovia. -Segovia? -Yes. Please wait for me, don't go. -Hello. -Hello. I want to see a prisoner. Go to Communications. Through this door, on the left. Thank you. -Hello. -What do you want? I want to see prisoner Benigno Martin. Today is not a visit day, but let me see. Excuse me, I can't hear you. Excuse me, it's not a visit day... ...and that inmate hasn't requested a visitor. He doesn't know I'm in Madrid, I arrived yesterday. I see. Are you family? No, I'm his friend. My name is Marco Zuloaga. Can I see an ID, please? Sure. -Can I call him on the phone? -You can't, but he can call you. I changed my number, can you give him the new one? -Sure. -OK, thanks. Very good. Excuse me. Remember, visit days... ...are Saturday and Sunday... ...but the inmate must request the visit. If he doesn't want to see you, there's nothing we can do. He'll want to see me. Thanks. Great. By the way, we don't have "prisoners" in here... I can't hear you. Excuse me, we don't have "prisoners", we have "inmates". -Good-bye. Thanks. -Bye. -Six-two-seven... -Wait. Yes. Nine-six... ...six-four... ...zero-nine. No, it's nine. Again. 627... Yes, hello? Marco, is that you? -Yes, Benigno. -It's great to see you. Hey, I've requested your visit. Will I see you next Saturday? -Sure. -Where are you? I'm in front of the hospital. Dr. Vega has told me everything. How could you, Benigno? Man, you didn't come back to Spain to scold me, did you? No. Do you need me to take anything to you on Saturday? I need information. What do you know about Alicia? No one from the hospital is allowed to talk to me. Her father took her to another hospital, they don't know where. -I don't believe that. -Me neither... ...but it's obvious they won't tell us. Hey, man... are you still my friend? Of course, why do you think I am here? Okay, find out what happened to Alicia. If she's alive, if the baby is born... ...if it's a boy or a girl, if it's alive. I need to know, Marco. You're mad at me, but you understand, don't you? Yes, I do. I'll try to find out. I'll see you next Saturday, Benigno. Did you find something out? Not yet, but I will. Be patient. I was patient until Alicia was 9 months pregnant... ...but that was a month ago. You must keep on waiting, Benigno. Damn... What do you do during the day? I work at the infirmary. This is a new prison... ...so there's not too many people, it's very quiet. It doesn't look like a prison from the outside. Prison is not my problem... ...but not seeing Alicia. According to forensics and Alicia's father, I'm a psychopath. Yes, a psychopath. They say that's good for the trial... ...but I don't care about the trial. I need to see Alicia and know how things ended. If this doesn't change, I'd do something stupid. Don't they say I'm a psychopath? Then I'll behave as one. Don't say that, Benigno, please. Oh, find me a new lawyer. Mine is public and he has a hard time not punching me. Okay, okay. I'll call the doorwoman to give you the keys to my home. Hire it and pay the lawyer with that money. I can hire your apartment, I hired mine too. Okay. I like you to be my tenant. I've thought a lot about you in these past months... ...mostly at night. Why at night? Because I read at night. I've read all the tourist guides you gave me. It's been like... traveling with you for months... ...telling me things no one tells you about trips. My favorite guide is La Havana's... ...and I felt identified with those people... ...who have nothing and make it all up. When you describe that Cuban woman... ...leaning on a window in front of the sea wall... ...waiting pointlessly... ...seeing how time goes by and nothing happens... ...I thought that woman was me. Good morning, madam. I'm Benigno's friend. Oh, are you Marco, from Argentina? Yes. I am the doorwoman. Benigno called to tell me... -... that you'll hire his place. -That's right. It will be very untidy, because he expressly forbid me... ...to go in and clean. I wasn't going to charge for it, but... Don't worry, I'll take care of that. -Should I give you the key? -Yes. I'll see if I can find it. Have you seen him? -Yes. -How is he? Fine. Not even in jail has that poor man been lucky. He hasn't got much attention. No one has come from the TV, no paparazzo. So many trashy TV programs... ...and not one has come, I don't know... ...to interview me, for example. It's sad the state the mass media are in this country. Yes, you have that right. -The key... -Oh, yes! Thanks. Oh, by the way... Do you know why Benigno is in jail? He's very quiet, so the last time he came... ...he didn't say a word. Benigno is innocent. Well, of course he is, I know that... ...but innocent of what? I don't know. You don't? Of course you do, but you won't tell me. But I'll make you tell me. Okay. See you, ma'am. If you need anything, you know... I'm very excited, Alicia, to see you come in by yourself. With your canes, on your own. -Did you see me? -How was rehab today? -Very good. -Are you tired? -Yes, very. -It doesn't matter. Let's do some complementary exercises. We'll do some flex-extensions. I've done a hundred today. Yes, it doesn't matter, let's do some more. Okay. Yes? I have an appointment with Mr. Saenz. Come in. Thank you. The fetus was born dead. It was a boy. But Alicia is awake. Benigno should know. Regarding his state of mind, I don't think so. He'd do something crazy. But I can't lie to him. I'm his only friend, he trusts me. I will. It is no problem for me. I'll tell him Alicia is still in coma and the baby is dead... ...but you must promise me you won't tell him. -What about parole? -It isn't likely... ...and it would be very expensive, but we can try. Number 8. -Hi, Marco. -Hi, Benigno. -Did you get wet? -A little. Be careful, don't get a cold. Have a big glass of hot milk when you get home... ...with a teaspoon of honey. Okay. Ever since I'm here I like rainy days. Have you seen the new lawyer? Yes. Yes, he was here. He told me everything. It won't be easy for me, right? In fact, it won't. At least Alicia is the same after childbirth. It consoles me and it gives me hope. Are you okay, Benigno? I'd like to be able to hug you, Marco. But to hug you I'd have to ask for a vis-à-vis. I've tried it, you know? They asked me if you were my boyfriend. I didn't dare to say yes... ...in case you mind. I don't mind at all. You can say whatever you want. I've hugged very few people in my life. A message. Marco, I was very glad to see you today... ...and to be able to say good-bye. As you know, they won't let me go out... ...or it will be to confine me somewhere else. Marco, I don't want to live in a world without Alicia... ...a place where I can't even keep her hairpin... ...so I decided to escape. I didn't tell you for you not to worry... ...or to try to keep me from doing it. A very tight hug, Marco. Taxi! -To Segovia. -Segovia? -Yes, to jail. -To jail? Yes. Madam, I need to see Benigno Martin urgently. I know this is not the way, but this is life-and-death. The principal is waiting for you in his office. Where is his office? The officer with walk you. This way. To the right. -Empty your pockets, please. -Yes. Hey, hey! Wait a minute! Don't run! Wait for me. It's in there. Over there. Good morning. I'm Marco Zuloaga. Benigno Martin left this letter for you. Dear Marco... ...it's still raining. I think that's a good omen. When Alicia had that accident it was raining too. I'm writing to you a few moments before escaping. I hope what I've taken is enough to fall into a coma... ...and get together with her. You are my only friend. The house I prepared for Alicia and me is yours. Wherever they take me, come and see me... ...and talk to me. Tell me everything. Don't be so impenetrable. See you forever, my friend. These are the retained objects... ...and these are the personal belongings we found in his cell. You have to sign here. Sir, you have to sign here. Benigno, it's me. Alicia is alive. You woke her up. When I heard your message I ran to jail to tell you... ...but I was late. Alicia's hairpin is in your pocket... ...and also her pictures... ...and your mother's... ...so that they will be with you for eternity. ...cruel signs. Masculine below, feminine above. I'll get you some water. Take a seat. -Are you okay? -Yes. I don't know. -I'm much better now. -What? Let's go, baby. -Let's go inside. -Okay. Come on. -You're shaking. -I'm not. You are. Why? -What have you told her? -Nothing. I've seen you talking. Alicia asked me if I was okay and I thanked her. Don't worry if you see me in your neighborhood. I live across the street from your dance school. -At Benigno's? -Yes. Why do you live there? Benigno is dead. You and I should talk some day. Yes, and it will be simpler than you think. Nothing is simple. I'm a ballet teacher, and nothing is simple.
