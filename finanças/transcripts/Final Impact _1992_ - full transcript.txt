[music playing] [chatter and music] CASHIER: $10, please. Enjoy the show. Can I help you? Yeah, is Nick Taylor here? It's $10 to get in. No, is Nick Taylor here? CASHIER: I said $10. Do you want to oil the girls? What? For $20, you can oil the wrestlers. No, thanks. [chatter and music] [shouting] [whistle] [whistle] Where's Nick Taylor? Nick Taylor? Thank you. [knock on door] Come in. DANNY: Nick Taylor? - I know you? - Yes, sir. We, uh, met once. It's a long time ago. Let me guess. You're this year's top gun come to pay homage to the master. Right? [laughs] Bless you, my son. May you go out amongst the masses and kick ass until you reach the promised land. What happened to you? What happened to me? Kid, I'm going to pull in more money tonight than I did in my best month as champion of the fucking world. You used to say self-respect was the most important thing a man could own. Oh, gee. Does that mean I'm not your hero anymore? You don't know a damn thing about me, kid. Then I guess I don't. Hold on. Let's see if you can fight as well as you can talk. [chatter and music] [cheering] Tony. Can I have my receipts, too, please? [cheering] How you doing, Nicky? He's good. [cheering] Ah, you seen one, you seen 'em all. No. No, he's really good. [cheering and applause] [music playing] I'm invincible. What's wrong? Nothing. What are you looking for? My keys. You seen them? Where are you going? I'm going out. Got to talk to a guy. Look, Nick, whatever you're planning to do, I'm sure you'll feel a lot better in the morning if you just come home with me. What's that supposed to mean? Huh? Am I out of control or something like that? Just come home with me, OK? Give me the keys. Come on. Thank you. [music playing] Nobody's invincible. [crowds cheering] [music playing] [screams] [music playing] Don't worry, kid. I'm alone. That wasn't fair loss night. If it had been one-on-one. You know, sometimes life isn't fair, kid. I don't need advice from losers. Wait a minute. I want to show you something. I want you to hit me. What? Hit me. I don't hit old men. Hit me, God damn it! Come on. So what's your point? My point is you can't hit me. So? So you think you're king of the world, but you can't lay a glove on a defenseless old man? You Used to be champion of the world. Not anymore. And if you can't hit me, you can't beat the guy who beat me. Right? Now look, Danny, you came by the club last night for a reason, right? I'm on my way to Vegas for the world championships. I thought you could recommend a trainer. Come back tonight. [music playing] So, what's the special occasion? What do you mean? Well, you don't usually barbecue in the middle of the week. - No special reason. Tony said you were thinking about treating that kid. You mean Danny? Yeah, Danny. Think you finally found someone who can beat Jake? Hey, the kid does look good, you got to admit. I thought it was over, this thing between you and Jake. Look, this has nothing to do with that, OK? The kid wants to be champion of the world. He's got to beat Jake. It's as simple as that. Don't lie to me, Nick. This is about revenge. Jake took my title. He took my pride. He took my wife. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to pretend that it didn't happen? No, accept it and move on. It happened three years ago. It's over. Jake didn't take your pride. You did that yourself. If life with me is so lousy, you can always walk away. Oh, you'd really like that, wouldn't you? Things don't work out, just walk away. I don't love easily, Nick, but when I do, it means something. I'm sorry. OK? Look, just trust me on this. I know how to beat Jake. I can show Danny what no one showed me. You think you're as quick as you used to be? [chuckles] What I'm going to show Danny has nothing to do with quickness. [music playing] [laughter] Come on, I'll race you. [music playing] (WHISPERING) He drops his left on the jab. You ready? What the hell is this? I thought you were going to teach me something new. I beat the hell out of this guy the other night. Then this ought to be a piece of cake. [music playing] Look, kid, maybe you misunderstood me when I said fight with your head. I didn't mean lead with it. Yeah, OK. So what happened? It's simple. I told him how you fight. What do you mean? You're predictable. Predictable ? Yeah? If I'm so predictable, how come I'm the light heavyweight champ of Ohio! Gee whiz, I forgot all about that. [laughs] Do you forgive me? So what now? Danny, you got to learn what to look for and understand what you see. You can teach me that? I told Jimmy how you fight, and you're 10 times the fighter he is on his best day. You really think I'm good, huh? You're not half as good as you think you are. Hey, man, listen, I don't need this! You need to understand something. You could be better than you ever dreamed. Maybe better than anybody I ever seen. Better than you? You're going to have to be if you want to be Jake. It's your call, kid. So when do we start? We just did. [music playing] What are you doing? - What? You got to keep the guard up, right here. I want to see it here. Come on, you're still open. I can drive a truck through it. Ah! [music playing] Uh! How many you done? Like you said, 50. You're halfway there. What? [music playing] Good. Now you're thinking. Now you're thinking. Good. Keep going. Hook! Hook! Put some hip into it. All right, so what now? Throw me a right cross. Stop. What would you do to counter that? Just swat it away like this. OK. Throw it again. What about moving five inches to the right? Yeah, I will. I could. Try again. Or ducking under, cutting the guy in half with an uppercut. Sure, I could do that, too. Try again. Or just leaning back. Look, I know all this stuff. I know you do. All's I'm saying, that if I'm fighting you and I'm guessing right most of the time, most of the time I'm going to be kicking your ass. All right, so what do you want me to do? I'm going to come at you slow at first. I want you to do the second thing that comes into your mind. The second thing? That's the thing after the first, OK? Think. Good. [music playing] Put it on. What for? We're going to try something new today. Oh, I see. You want me to do the third thing I think of when you come at me. I don't want you to think at all. You mean not let myself know what I'm going to do? Imagine what a surprise that'd be to me. [music playing] Hey, Nick! I'm sorry, man. I didn't know it was going to throw that hook. Neither did I, Danny. Neither did I. [music playing] Thanks. So, Danny. Got a girl back home? No, just mom. Mom? Does she know you're here? Yeah. She told me to come. She says dreams don't wait for people. What about dad? Now dad, his dreams are always right around the corner. He used to say, just wait'll this time next year. We'll be living in a place twice this size. Next year never came. MAGGIE: You really want this, don't you? I mean, for yourself, not just because Nick wants it for you. I never wanted anything so bad in my life. But you know, when I beat Jake, I'm going to take a little time off. Bring my mom home a present. The championship belt. Bring her a dream. I haven't seen that in a long time. Hey, that's not bad for an old man. Mind if I try? Be my guest. [music playing] Not bad. Not bad. I copied every move you ever did. By the way, we're going to make a little stop on our way to Vegas tomorrow. Why? I got you a tune up with Johnny Fareed. Fareed! You fought him for the title in '87. If you can't beat Fareed, you got no business in the ring with Jake. Think I'm ready? We'll see tomorrow, won't we? [music playing] MAGGIE: What, no valet parking? NICK: It's a lot nicer inside. That I got to see. Tyrone? Hey, man. Good to see you. Hey, Stevie. Nicky! My man! Come here. What's happening? Long time, no see. All right, man. Listen, I want you to meet Danny Davis. Stevie Oliveras. - Danny. - How you doing? - How you doing, buddy? OK. So this is the kid you think is going to beat Fareed, huh? That's what we're here to find out. Fareed's getting ready for Vegas, too. He's going to need somebody to break a sweat with him. Might as well be him. I can pretty much guarantee that. [clears throat] Uh, this is Maggie, my-- uh-- Don't choke on it, Nick. Please to meet you. The pleasure is mine. Listen, when you decided to leave this bum, I'm completely, completely at your service. Anything you desire. You just name it. Anything. How about the ladies room? The ladies room, yes. That it right over there. Thank you. It's been a long trip, you know. [laughs] She's cute. Listen, um, Nicky, come here. Since we're so close to, uh, gambling land, what say you and I have a little friendly wager? What wager? I'm a fighter. I don't know, Stevie, it's-- Oh, what? No confidence? At least I want to put my money where my mouth is. How much? $300. Talk about no confidence. A thousand. Two. Good. I'll see you later. Yeah. So anything I should know? Don't let him grab you, or sweep you. You don't want to fight this guy on the ground, remember? What should I do if he takes me down? Don't resist. It's important. I've seen him break a guy's elbow once. What should I do? You can beat him at his own game. He takes you down, counter him. You got it? I got it. Show me. [music playing] Whoo! Yes! Ha-ha! Yes! Yes! Whoo! All right! [laughter] That makes $2,000. I, uh, hope we worked up enough sweat to make it worthwhile for your boy. Um-hum. I guess I'm going to have to ask him whenever he gets up. What are you going to do with the kid, Nicky? He says he wants to be champion of the world. I'll see you in Vegas, Stevie. Yeah. What was that all about? Expense money. What's this for? It's your cut. You earned it. Let's go. [music playing] [laughs] I just confirmed things with Sal. You got two fights tomorrow, pal. Tomorrow? That's right. Hey, to Vegas, huh? And the championships! MAGGIE: To winning. You guys, I got to take a look around. I've never been to Vegas before. That's a good idea. You know, the volcano goes off in the Mirage in 10 minutes. Really? I'll see you guys later. I was kidding. He trusts you. Oh, why shouldn't he? Don't let him get hurt, Nick. I won't. I promise. Cross my heart, hope to die. [music playing] Oh, you get him, baby! Oh, yeah! Come on, get up. Where'd you get this bum? Come on, man. Come on. Hey, what'd you think? You're looking good, baby. You're looking real good. You're somebody that appreciates talent. OK, so we're here. What's the big news? Sal called this afternoon. He wants to know if we want to go into Vegas a day early. ESPN is doing the TV for the tournament, and he's got this promo he wants us to do. It'll put a feather in his cap, and get you some publicity. Sure, no sweat. Lovely. I told him-- $10,000 a day. $10,000 a day? What are you, sick or what, man? The guy guaranteed you $100,000. That's more than anybody ever got in this sport. I said I'd do it. What more does the guy want? Blood? Oh, you must have got Alzheimer. Don't you remember the guy took care of us when we were busted and down and out, and things weren't so good? Hey, look, Joe. I'm in the fighting business, not the favor business. But if it makes you feel uncomfortable-- OK, OK. I'll tell him. Oh, Sal said that Nick Taylor was in Stevie's gym this afternoon. He's still alive? The word's out. Nick's training this young kid, and Stevie said he's going to be a great one. I hope he's better than Nicky. JIM MCGRAW: Good afternoon. This is Gentleman Jim McGraw coming to you live from the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. It's no secret that champion Jake Gerrard is the clear favorite with all other fighters still trying to prove that they belong in the same ring with the champ. How you doing? Nervous, man. Listen to me, Danny. How many people you think get a shot? I mean, a real shot at their dreams in this life? Maybe one in a million? Now I never trained anybody before, and the only reason I trained you is because I know you got a shot. I'm proud of you, man. Win or lose? I didn't say that. JIM MCGRAW: If anyone has a chance against Gerrard, it figures to be number one contender Jackie Clark whose aerial antics are the talk of the sport. Our first fight of the day pits Jose Gonzalez, ranked number nine in the world, against the unranked Danny Davis. And here we go! [bell rings] [cheering] [music playing] Come on! All right, break it up. Come on, get over there! [cheering] Yeah! [cheering] I beat Gonzalez, Nick! I beat Gonzalez! Yeah. But you're still not the champ. Oh, not yet. [cheering] MAGGIE: [laughs] Come on, you're tickling me. Feels like old times. I never should have quit fighting. You made the right decision. It's what I do best. You're good at other things. The club is doing great. Yeah, but that's a business. Fighting is my passion. It's the only thing I ever gave a damn about. The only thing? Except you. I love you, Nick. I always have. And I always will. Did you hear what I just said? Yeah. ANNOUNCER: And in the blue corner, fighting out of Los Angeles, California, weighing in at 176 pounds, he is the light heavyweight champion of the world. Introducing Jiltin' Jake Gerrard! [booing] I want you get him right off the get go. Sucker punch him right off the clinch. - OK. - Are you ready? - Yeah. - Are you ready! - Yeah! - What are you going to do? - I'm going to kill him! - What are you going to do? I'm going to kill him! Then go in there and get the bastard! [cheering and boos] [bell rings] [music playing] Did I miss anything? Nothing you couldn't see in the local slaughterhouse. What are you doing? I just want to go, OK? OK. [music playing] You ever watch Jake fight before? It's the first time in person. Go to school, kid. Boo, Jake! [cheers and boos] Yeah! Want to play a little blackjack? You know, I'm pretty good at this if you want some advice. Oh, really? Yeah. I got a system. - A system? Shh! I've been reading all afternoon. It's a counting system. No kidding. I'm real good with numbers. Well, let's see. NICK: After you. Sir, will you put the money down on the table, please. Sorry. Can I have a cocktail waitress, please? [music playing] Hit me. I want to double down. You're going to double down on 12? You're doubling down on 12? Hah! Thank you. System, huh? Shh! Ah! [laughs] Hey, how's it going? Great. I got more silver dollars than I started with. Ah! Hey! [laughs] How'd you do? Oh, I won a few hundred bucks. Shouldn't you be in bed? Yeah, I'm going to go up in a few minutes. Nick got me my lucky seat for the fight tomorrow, so you got nothing to worry about. Lucky seat? Nick's superstitious. I used to always in the same seat when saw him fight. [coins rattling] Ah! [inaudible] Nick's superstitious? Come on. I wasn't there the night he fought Jake. Come on! ANNOUNCER: And in the blue corner, introducing his opponent from Boulder, Colorado, weighing in at 173 pounds. This young man is rated number two in the light heavyweight division of kickboxing. Introducing Jackie "The Hawk" Clark. [cheering] Hey. Sure you don't know anything more about this guy? All I know is if you want a shot at Jake, you got to beat this guy. That ought to be enough motivation. [bell rings] [bell rings] [cheering] [music playing] [cheering] [bell rings] NICK: Kid, talk to me. What's going on out there? This guy's fast. He's all over the place. He's a clown. He's all show. He's dropping his right every time you bring your left knee up. So fake him, four times. I'll never touch him. Just listen to me, OK? He's jumping all over the place, all right? He's theatrical. Just fake him three, four times, nail him with heel kicks. You got it? Yeah. [bell rings] [music playing] He's OK. He's all right, ref. [music playing] [cheering] [cheering] [cheering] [inaudible] [cheering and applause] WAITER: Fruit tart? NICK: No. WAITER: Fruit tart? MAGGIE: No. Low fat mousse? No. You hear that sound? You hear that? It's the sound of those lips quivering for one of my magical macadamia morsels. They just lay in my tray all day and go, eat me, eat me. They're so lonely. Why, 30 minutes after you've had one, whisker lips, your tongue still be roaming around in there looking for a little morsels in your teeth. Look, we just don't want any dessert, OK? Danny sure looked great today, didn't he? Yeah, he looked good. So did Jake. What's the matter? It's just this whole thing, Nick. It's Vegas, it's Jake, it's Danny. It's like you're trying to rid yourself of some demon. So what if I am? You'd stand a better chance if you faced them head on. Really? Sober. Without crutches. Jake's the one that put me on crutches. For six months. Or don't you remember? I remember. But the crunches I'm talking about you bought and paid for in the bar. That's real sensitive of you. You ought to be a writer. Do you have a [inaudible] for four for Gerrard? [music playing] Nick, don't. Hey, Nicky! You in town for the senior's tour? Actually, I came to see you get your ass kicked. I hope that you bought a house because you guys are going to be here for a while. Roxy. Hi, Nicky. You're looking pretty drunk there. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, you still look like a whole. You piece of shit! I destroyed you once, I can do it again! Stop it! Stop it! What more do you want? He insulted my wife. Maggie, get out of here. I won't. This won't change anything. Tomorrow night, man. Neon Graveyard. I'll be there. I doubt it. You're a chicken shit. [inaudible] Come on, baby, let's go. Come on. Leave me alone. [music playing] Got a light? Bartender says you're a boxer. I used to be. Like Mike Tyson? Bigger. Oh, yeah? You rich? Not anymore. But I've still got enough money to show a girl a good time. Yeah? You got a name? Nick. You? Kimber. Come on, Kimber. [music playing] Give me a Long Island iced tea. [music playing] Look, I'm sorry. Yeah, well, don't worry about it. Happens to everybody. It's never happened to me before. Yeah, right. Look, man. You got some cab fare? What? Cab fare. Yeah, sure. World champion, my ass. [knock on door] [knock on door] [knock on door] Surprise. Can I come in? Sure. You OK? I've been better. You want to sit-- sit down? I need some fresh air. I need another one. I don't think so. You're drunk. I'm lonely. I haven't been drunk in years, but I've been lonely for a long time. I think you need some coffee. That's not what I need. I don't think you need to do something you're going to regret tomorrow. I like you, Danny. You're the hero, Nick used to be. No, it's not easy being the champ and then-- Then what! A bitter old drunk? Is that what you were going to say? He doesn't need you to defend him. The son of a bitch picked up a whole in a bar. I can't believe he would do this to me. I love him. I love him so much. [music playing] [knocking on door] Danny? Open up, man. Hey. Hey, what's up, man? Uh-- What's going on? I just wanted to talk to you. Why? What's up? Because I fucked up big time tonight. Look, it's 3:00 in the morning, man. I got a fight tomorrow. I got to get some sleep. Oh. I'm sorry. - It's all right. - Yeah. Get some sleep. - I will, man. Thanks. Uh, did you see Maggie? Nick, I-- Nick! You bitch. You lying, fucking bitch. Hey, man! What are you doing? You think Maggie and I-- Jesus, man, I think you better leave. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [music playing] Son of a bitch. [music playing] [crowd noises] [screams] [music playing] Maggie? Maggie, where are you going? I'm leaving, Nick. Well, OK, I-- I understand. Look, after the tournament, I'll come back and we can talk about it. I'm leaving you. Maggie. If it's about that girl tonight-- It has nothing to do with that girl. We've had 100 nights like tonight. Maybe not quite as dramatic, but you just didn't seem to notice. I'm tired of making excuses for you. I'm tired of making excuses for myself. Maggie, don't. Maggie. Don't leave. I could change. I need you. You don't need me, Nick. You need yourself. You get that back, call me. The airport, please. NICK: Hey, Danny. I'm sorry about everything that happened last night. Yeah well, let's just forget about it, OK? I haven't been honest with you. I haven't been honest with anybody lately, especially myself. NICK: What do you mean? I've been using you. I didn't care if you won the championship or not. I just-- I wanted somebody to beat Jake. I wanted revenge. And you're the only guy I ever met who had a prayer. The way I look at, we were using each other, you know? I guess what I'm trying to say is, is that is my fight with Jake, Danny. And you can walk away any time. I understand. I'm not sure you do. I don't want to see you get hurt because of me. I don't want to see you get hurt period. I'm not walking away without that championship belt. No way. ANNOUNCER: Quite frankly, fans, the story of this tournament can be summed up in two words-- Danny Davis. Most fans are looking forward to tomorrow's championship fight but there's a great deal of money and prestige on the line tonight for third and fourth place with several top ranked fighters needing a strong showing. Ronnie Martin's looked good so far in deserving of his number four world ranking. [cheering] And here we go! [bell rings] [music playing] Ah! [bell rings] [music playing] ANNOUNCER: Davis goes for the championship, and Gerrard secures his championship slot. [cheering] [music playing] Hey, Danny, toss me a pair of those. What's going on? I want you to come at me hard. You're kidding, right? I'm still the teacher, right? That you are. Let's go. Hey man, you let me do that. Why? I wanted to see if I can still take a shot. Thanks. [music playing] Nicky? Can I ask you something? Why are you doing this? Because I got to. You can't beat Jake. That's what I need, Stevie, positive thinking. Yeah, well, I'm positive that you can't beat him. Look, is there any way that I can talk to you out of this? Nope. You got any money on this fight? No. [music playing] You got a bet. Now everybody listen up. This is the way this fight's comin' down. There ain't no rules, there ain't no rounds, and there ain't no time limit. The winner is the guy that's left standing, and the loser is the guy that can't get up or is unable to continue. So let's get it on. [music playing] [cheering] Whoo! Come on, Jake! Get him! [music playing] [knock on door] Maggie? What are you doing here? Danny, can I come in? Yeah, sure. I thought you were leaving. Well, I was. Danny, I need your help. Why? What's wrong? Well, actually Nick does. He's fighting Jake tonight, and you're the only one that-- Fight? What fight? Oh, God. I didn't think you knew. Come on, I'll tell you on the way. Let's go. Nick's fighting Jake in the Neon Graveyard tonight. The association would never sanction a bout like that. This isn't an official fight. Jake's going to kill him. You're the only one who can stop him. [music playing] [cheering and music] Ah! Oh! Ah! Uh! Ah! [music playing] Ahh! [cheering and shouting] [crack] Easy, boy. You go in there, you get your ass kicked. Ah! [cheering] Ah! - Joe, please! You've got to stop this fight! I with I could, but I can't. If you really want to be a right guy, go call an ambulance. [music playing] DANNY: Nick! Nick! [music playing] [beeping] [music playing] (WEAKLY) You came back. I'm here baby, I'm not going anywhere. I love you. Did you hear me? I love you, too. Hey, Danny. How you doing? I've been better. [coughs] I learned something tonight. Something I should have learned a long time ago. Winning is not about getting even. It's about being true to yourself. Get a doctor. Hurry. Hang on, baby. [beeping] (QUIETLY) Hang on, OK? [beeping stops] Oh, God. No. No-- [sobs] No, no, no. [sobs] Thank you. - You're welcome. Danny, I want you to promise me something. What? Promise me you won't fight Jake. I can't promise you that. That maniac murdered Nick. Don't make me cry for you, too. [music playing] I can't. You can, but you won't. Your pride is going to put you in a grave right next to your hero. [sobs] [music playing] [cheering] Hey, man, what are they cheering about, man? I'm the champion. Don't worry about it. Get your head into the fight. That's Cupcake Cassidy out there. You ought to whack him out in the first round.
