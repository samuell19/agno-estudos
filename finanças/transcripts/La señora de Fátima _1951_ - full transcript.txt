you my name is Lucia dos Santos when I was 10 years old an extraordinary event changed my life forever I was touched by the supernatural and blessed with a secret a secret I have kept without reservation my superiors have now asked me to write it all down the memory stored in my heart it was 1917 the essence of the world was made Kings had been shocked and brother it was also a time of revolution in Russia the Bolsheviks were preparing to seize power they had declared the church an enemy of the people and their word spread like poison in the hearts of men in Portugal the monarchy had been overthrown and replaced with a Republican government intent on the elimination of all religion within two generations may God forgive you Arturo dos Santos but in f?tima it's seen for us we were lucky our lives went on almost as long my father owned a large plot of land the cover the area here's my brothers and sisters before me I came to an age when it became my duty to look after our sheep all the village children worked as I did often grazing their flocks together they always asked me to come and join them but I preferred my own company although two of the children usually made a point of coming to find me my young cousins Jacinta and Francisco yeah yes since I wanted to be my little helper and always insisted a devoted brother come with her to join me in the fields they were inseparable well as long as you know we want the playing games all day Francisco was a gentle boy he always did as his little sister rushed never protesting or becoming impatient with her he was a quiet and sensitive soul very like his father thoughtful and compassionate and not at all like our little Jacinta who just had to be the center of attention if she didn't get what she wanted she would sulk until we gave in are you going to sit there all day probably that's the one thing that could always distract her and lighten her mood she loved to dance I'm Francisco loved to play for her this is how life was for until the 13th for men at first we thought a storm was coming it was as though the whole world was holding its breath then we saw her a lady more brilliant than my son she saw do not be afraid I am from heaven I could feel her love was overly like a wave she asked us if we would be willing to suffer for God for our suffering would save so many sinners when we said yes the light of heaven pierced my heart and filled my soul we agreed between us that we shouldn't speak of this to anyone but Jacinta who so overcome her enthusiasm was too much she seemed to stop you mustn't tell anyone he just had to talk about the lady right what lady not just any lady our lady and she appeared the right in front of them a sign from heaven I didn't say you fear what is this all about Lucia Lucia sure mama we saw can come from heaven and she was so beautiful mom it is blasphemy that is what it is I don't know how you could make up side lies you Francisco and Jacinta say they saw something at the cover then I believe them you can believe what you like but I tell you these lies will bring the wrath of God down upon our heads I don't know what you're playing at Michael that you will stop this nonsense right now before it gets out of hand do you hear me but it's true you hear me strong up lying stop light true love it stop it no stay up mama Stroman Marie you Mariya am I the only one with any sense around here come on children as if I don't have enough to worry about without my youngest making up such things maybe she did see a beautiful lady floating in the sky this is all your fault I have told you about filling their heads with silly fairy stories ah de ferreira will know what to do I shall take her to him first thing you said this woman spoke with you yes but what did she say she told us not to be afraid did she say anything else from the start I was inspired by the lady to answer so that I neither light nor reveal the thing she wanted us to keep secret I told them she said we should pray the rosary every day and that she had asked us to return at the same hour of 13th day of every month for six months and she'll perform a miracle so I told cause he I don't know why she is making up such wicked lies by today she's always been such a good child I'm not really I'm not Padre surely you do not believe that the Virgin Mary appeared to these children if she saw something that was indeed of supernatural origin but I do not believe it was a revelation from heaven it is usual in such cases for our Lord to tell those to whom he makes such communication to give to a confessor or the parish priest an account of what has happened but with this child on the contrary she keeps as much as she can to herself father Ferrara's final words filled me with terrible doubt she's always been such a good time I'm not making it up maybe she saw something I do not believe it was a revelation from heaven it's the devil the grace of god is my strength grace off guys muslin every night my dreams were plagued by those doubts and fears and my days were filled with torment if it's not a little is a wonderful children can get in the weeks that followed the world that I had known slowly turned against me don't you steal I was here lady floating above your house don't you see what makes you so special by these lies will bring the wrath of God down upon our heads I said I would never go back there however much my cousin's pleaded with me I've made up my mind I would not see her anymore but on the day that she said she would return I felt myself drawn back to the Cova like a moth to a flame she was so beautiful so good I had to return I had to see her face again I feel the love and where are you going is the 13th you really believe those children what if it's true Lily we'll be home for supper you'll be the only one there you silly old fool Lucia okay look look I can't see anything I asked her what it was that she wanted of me she said for me to pray the rosary for peace and then she told me that I must learn to read and write I will make a message known to the world from that day on more and more people came to the coven some looking for cures others to ask his questions all of them with faith rekindled in their hearts and with this renewed faith came a courage that had not surfaced before he built a shrine at the cover a beacon of hope to be seen by all fires of superstition can do terrible damage if not contained I fully understand the seriousness of the situation I assure you with that of course we had great faith in you Arturo how dare you come into this house smelling of drink I've had one drink don't enlighten me all right I had a few drinks hmm I've been talking business business what kind of business with sancho garish we can do without help from the likes of him I went to the culvert today everything has been trampled by the crowds or eaten by the animals central said he could help us help himself more like we can manage without his kind of help when will it be enough fleas when you have taken every item offered clothing every look overhead much more of this why is she doing this uh I just can't understand why she is doing this stuff take her to see the priest again I'll take a broom handle to her that what I'll do I'll be those wicked line up and one super old is because I you I wanted to tell my mother that it wasn't true to ease her fears but from the cradle she had taught us that above all we must always tell the truth and I remembered how the lady had told me that she would be my comfort and my strength the day my sister left I held on to those words even as I felt my heart breaking mamasan the work for me as a servant for a rich family she's saving you the money we don't have enough to eat hurry up or you'll be late from now on if you want something to eat you can eat what grows at the cover I offered my suffering to God and thought of all the souls that I was saving what I think it is a pity for them Maria Santos she likes to give herself airs now she's a laughingstock serves her right and have you seen the state of their land ruined so many feet trampling crops all gone you know and what did you see now it was difficult so many people if I heard tiny voice like music maybe next time if there is the next time they said the government resent men to block the rose soldiers with guns maybe cannons can they say all sorts doesn't mean it's true Maria Romney me says her aunt could barely opal there with a pain in her bad leg but she skipped all the way home that was the why she say that no it's true she has a bad soul no it's completely dry told everybody my sister a nurse told her cousins next time there will be so many people they won't dare stop us if those little children and afraid to go neither should we the apparition of the 13th of July was different the lady appeared just as she had before but this time there was a sadness about her and when she opened her hands it was not heavens warmth that embraced us but the fires of hell then she showed us a city - room people turn to God he will punish the world with a second it's generational to prevent this she would come back to us for the Pope to consecrate Russia to her Immaculate Heart then we still did not act on her requests godless men who spread their communism throughout the world causing war famine and persecutions of the church the good will be martyred the Holy Father and have much to suffer a mother's we saw an angel shouting penance penance penance he pointed the source towards the earth is used to set the world on fire but the flames were stunned by the splendor that are Laden radiated toward him she said in her Immaculate Heart I'm trying and a period of peace will be granted to the world that's my daughter you're going on what's happened you say you do these crowds they are dangerous a powder keg a few rabble rousers a voluble cleric and we could have a riot on our hands that would not look good for me in Lisbon do we understand each other certain the children they need to answer some questions in the public interest for the records which must be thorough we have worked too long for the priests to undermine us with more fairy tales but no violence I want no martyrs here the things we had seen had changed us Francisco became even more withdrawn from the world and even Jacinta preferred solitude to the continual questions we have now come to endure so we spent our days up in the hills hiding from the world but we could not hide forever on the morning of the next operation the administrator senior de Oliveira Santos came looking for us he said he wanted to take us to see father Ferreira who had questions for us all this won't take long and when we're done I'll take you to the Cova myself that way you'll avoid all the crowds on the roads mmm and besides I'd like to see one of these monthly miracles with my own eyes maybe I believe to just like Thompson he did not take us to father Ferreira he took us back with him to the government headquarters in Oran come with me Paul you three have caused quite a stir must be exciting to have your names in the newspapers hmm you don't look excited you look frightened well you should be thousands of people are probably standing in a field right now waiting for some kind of miracle to happen how do you think they will feel when nothing happens soon play senior you must let us go you must were promised her yes lady that floats in the sky is it true this lady confided a secret to you yes in your booth was it can tell the senior we promise not to tell anyone you think this is some sort of game withholding important information from the government he's an offense punishable by death hostile isn't it and if she gives permission I will tell her listen maybe if I tell you how you will die it will you send your tongues there is a cauldron Alba filled with boiling oil you will be lowered into the quarter slowly an inch at a time the flesh will be boiled off your bones I will tell you what I'm going to do I will give you a little time to think over the seriousness of your situation make yourselves at home are you the ones everyone is talking about children or Fatima they supposed to hear messages from heaven they Capuchin and one planes in the hall of torture where no one can hear your prayers where are the children you would you seemed didn't delays had to go to suffer much think of all the souls will say don't cry don't be afraid you do any of you ladies know how to dance I will always picture Jacinta as she was that day afraid with tear-stained cheeks dance it wasn't supposed to run this way until the matter there is nowhere else I'd rather be well you you will stop that now what there will be trouble I'm here she think you'd be praying give us this day our daily bread there are some who say that our lady came down to the home oak in the form of a small blue cloud and finding we were not there rose again to heaven look Lucia look at the lamps of the angels shining brightly in the sky are they really lumps of the Angels of course ain't a moon that is the lamp of Our Lady so beautiful to hear me do something now Wow we against rifles and guns hmm go home gusano you can take them we are many we're sure gonna go signs your phone all of you

God prefer seeing it now in the hour of our death she's fry I'm not afraid to die I'm not it will be hewn X Lucia unless you tell me the seat and admit it was all lies hmm or other bye anyway you sure I no longer felt any fear for myself only joy that I would soon be going to you're afraid to go we were free free to return home but there was no welcome for me there in October the rains came my mother said it was heavens way of putting an end to childish nonsense but to me it was the tears of the angels weeping for all those who would never believe and I prayed that the miracle the lady had promised us would be big enough for the whole world to see who's with Santos can't you guess Oh a reporter so what do you think is it make-believe for divine inspiration I think it is God's Word God's will not just children's imaginings no sinew you do not imagine no why you see does not love a console spoon of life you must understand I have to question this a you and every other outsider who comes here thinking they know best my crops are ruined the cover is ruined every day more and more people swarm onto my land like locusts my family is suffering and you resent this favoritism of God it is pointless to resent what is out of our hands I see them a little serious really in jail they came and praying with us the company doesn't want us poor people knowing about the greatness of our lady we heard that they are planning to throw bombs at the crowd this time usin lots of people but you're still going Oh Senor hmm there is going to happen a miracle I wouldn't risk his life for now you seem very sure senior I have talked to the June didn't to see use I believe them rain converted you they open my eyes and I thought it was she pins she willing for opening I don't mind you asking questions especially while you're buying wine but no everyone here is simply a gullible peasant you don't share his optimism I believe what I can see with my eyes touch with my hands so you're not going to the golf course i we all are they say 100,000 may come would you want your grandchildren to ask about a miracle in your village and had to tell them I wasn't there and if there is no miracle via could it be that all of this is God's will in punishment for my sins if this is all God's work and praise be to God I've been told more than once today what will happen if nothing happens tomorrow I do not think they'll harm the children how do you know what they're capable of look why don't you stay here tomorrow I will go with the children this is not about you proving what a big hero you are t-mart oh no it's about proving what kind of father I am I'm going with you could it be that all of this is God's wing in punishment for my sins it's about proving what kind of father I Lucia come it's time to get you ready come if you must go I'm going die with you you Oh Oh Oh we will each be judged for our actions this day you should not have let the children go ABB's amongst walls what if she doesn't come today what if she wants come anymore she promised stop that'd be a good sign hey do you think that you it wasn't true it's all crappy whoever wants to go can go but I'm not our lady told us to come she'll be here soon it's stopped raining what do you want from me of all the things said to us that day what impressed me most deeply was her tender sorrow she said that we must turn to God for he is already so much offended she spoke so gently but with so much pain I wanted to spread her words throughout the whole world well she tickets to see heaven I want so much to see heaven she told me that she would take Francisco and Jacinta to heaven very soon but I would have to stage a might you see here alone she told me not to be afraid or she would be with me always we have been keeping Poliquin of the rosary you promised a miracle will show them a sign so that people will believe my god how great is your power they say 70,000 people saw the Sun dance that day and my whole world changed forever always there were people always questions everybody wanted to meet the little seers to pray with them to ask them for our lady's help we became curiosities it was not long before heaven kept its promise to my cousin's after the war the influenza came I do not remember how many weeks Francisco suffered but he never complained not once he took his flight to heaven on the 4th of April in 1919 Jacinta joined him a year later don't cry her final sacrifice to our lady was to die alone in a hospital in Lisbon on the 20th of February I'm coming Lola I am told that there is a language in which the word Fatima means peace it is my hope that Fatima will remain always a light in the dark a light that will lead us to peace people change but I know and this bin look I yeah fifteen but I know this makes me well Oh but uh this will you buy my you you you
