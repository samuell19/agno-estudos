You, keep your head up, up, up. Higher. You see that comet, up there? See the end of that stream, that's the North Star. And that's because it tells us where the North Pole is, now. Now we know that north is there. And we live, right down here... in the south, so... tada! We found our way home. Whenever you're lost... you just keep your chin, up. Now... let's go then. Mama's baked a pie. And it's tasty, I bet. Mr. Garrett? Abigale. - What's this? - What? William... what brings the head of the security department here? Yes, that was the order for your entire department. Good evening Mr. Garrett. What is all this fuss about? You know what I did to this city. How important I am to them, William. I will tell you what will happen. I walk him out of there... and no one will be able to laugh. Daddy? Is Mr. Garrett staying for tea? Yes my darling, I'm sure Mr. Garrett would love to have some tea. But it's bed time. You give me half an hour to move her to bed. - Dad. - Shh! Look what I have, it's a gift. I made it specially for you. It's so pretty. So round. Now this sphere... contains all my thoughts about you. You keep it with you always. Deal? Deal. Thanks daddy. Now, you go to sleep princess. And close your eyes, and I'll sit with you until you fall asleep. Come on. He can't be sick! You didn't even get him! Your husband is infected. He and everyone else at the lab. I'm sorry Margaret. ...there's no, colonel please. Why, you didn't get him! Daddy? This is the head of the security department speaking. For some time now the boundary has given us peace and quiet. But the epidemic has broken out once again. Henry's been taken hostage by Ian's gang. We meet at nine on the abandoned street. The number of infected people is growing every hour. We all need to unite to work together to deal with this crisis. We the executives of the security department, we will work harder than ever. Tirelessly conducting checks, in order to catch all the infections at an early stage. This disease is highly contagious, leads anyone infected to an excruciating death. We are doing everything in our power, to stop it from spreading across our city There are no recognizable symptoms of the onset, and this infection can only be detected by a special device. In stage 2 of the infection, the victum will experience fever and disease. In stage 3, convulsions and hallucinations. During the third stage, the victim becomes highly contagious. For the sake of public safety, all infected persons are quarantined, and a painless lethal injection is administered before the disease progresses to stage 3. Anyone sheltering infected persons... will be considered a traitor and will be charged, with treason for having put public safety at risk. Hi daddy. The curfew has begun. You are requested to return to your homes. He is our hostage. He was on our territory, where you're not allowed to go. Will scan you, and I bet at least one of you turns out to be infected. Just like your relatives. They'll take you in and give you the injection. Get out of here, while we are still being nice. If you start a war here now, the inspectors will come in no time. Shut your mouth... you, child of a leper. The first one who finds the flare, gets to the roof, and lights it, wins. If I win, you will let him go. And you Ian, will ask him for his forgiveness, on your knees. And ahh, what if I win? Hmm. Then I'll be your hostage instead of him. Well, get ready, you're not going home for a long time. Infection first stage, take him. No no no no no. It's a mistake, we're not infected! Uncle Roy? Roy, stop him, Garretts order. I, I don't know what he's thinking. But I've been told to be ready. I'll come by later. Worry? Try not to worry. I'm sure everything will work itself. Daddy. How did I get here? Oh, umm, wow! Shall we... investigate that, hmm? Now, can you tell me, Missy, what do you recall? Hmm? I came to sit with you. Yes, went to sit. And then you fell a sleep, ahh... that's it... you fell asleep. And then you forgot. Dad... what is that thing? Oh, that is a, that is so that you don't think. Dad... why do you have so many clocks? Well it's so that I, I don't, I don't lose track of time. You see because these clocks, they keep time safe. For you, and me. Can you really lose it? Abby, you'll be sitting here and you'll be listening to the tick tick tick tick, tick tick tick tick of all these clocks. And before you know it... it's gone. Happy boundry day my dear. It's a big holiday. It's not a holiday mom. I'll bake a cake. Go get me some flour. I'm not going outside today. What is this my daughter? Today everyone has to go to the square. I'm not in the mood. I would go myself, but I have to sit here at the sewing machine, until nighttime. All right. Hey, excuse me? - Could you please buy us some flour? - What are you doing? No. Okay, fine. - Mom please... - Excuese me, you see my daughter Abigail is not in the mood today. Okay, I'll go, I'll go. Get me some sugar too. Inspection trap, stop! I will take this one myself. I hit an inspector, that's it. We're finished. They'll never forgive us. - We need to run away. - Mom please stop. There's no place to run, we can't leave the city. Listen, Roy is dad's friend. They were taken away together. But now Roy's an inspector. So maybe dad is also alive. Your father is dead, he was infected. But Roy was too, and if he was sick then he should be dead for 10 years already Abby stop, pack your things. If we don't hide, they'll arrest us. Mom please! Mom please. Roy won't tell on us. How do you know that? Otherwise I'll tell everyone that he was visiting his wife. And that they have a child, that she keeps hidden at home. Why does she hide him? And why do the inspectors wear masks? The authorities don't want us to know that, some of them are very close to us. We're going to interrogate Roy. He will help us find dad. What, no Abby. Yes, what else do we have to lose? Why live a life where we're stigmatized as the family of an infected one? This way we can at least hope, to find dad. Where is my father? I'm going to report on both of you to the security department. This will be the end of you they'll take you both in. Go ahead, I've already told something about you. Roy, are you okay? Yeah. Now I see. And all the neighbors have been wondering who the father was. He's not supposed to see his family, but he can come back to us. You have to understand how much that means to me. Today we celebrate the 105th anniversary of the city boundry. We offer our most honorable respect for the founders of Kensington. Our wise leaders and visionaries of world peace and public order. They put an end to the threat of mass infection. Our enemies on the other side are using biological weapons in the war against us. If it hadn't been for our founding fathers our city would have become an infected zone. What do you want? You'll do as I say, or I'll turn you in, and your son will grow up without a father. Leave my family out of this Abby. I will, if you do what I say. Why the long face gentlemen? Smile. - People are watching us. - ...visiting every house door by door. Checking every single building in the city. I ask you to offer them whatever assistance you can. They work for the benefit of us all. Anyone sheltering an infected person, will be considered a traitor, and will be charged with treason, for having put public safety at risk. Where's my father? I don't know Abby. When they got us in we got immediately separated. I was offered a choice, either deportation, or become an inspector. And you choose to wear the mask. What's this? Is that the tunnel that leads to the residents of the security department? Yes. And do you know where they keep the information about the infected ones? Ethan Blake should know where your father is. Ethan Blake? He worked with dad. He's responsible for the infected ones. - Does he still live there. - Yes. I'll go there and see by myself. Nobody's allowed to leave the square during the ceremony. You'll see to it, that I'll be able to leave. Where are the headquarters? Answer me. Answer me. You're going to tell me, everything! Where are the headquarters? Where are the headquarters? Ethan... deportation. Please ad to the list, Ethan Blake. Half an hour. Deporting the infected to the permanent detention zone. Tell them, "The truck is with us". The truck is with us. Extra security. I have no information about this. What do you care? I'm the chief engineer, Ethan Blake. I told you. Open up. Now! Dad, let's pass the border. This subtitle created by Dandysubs on 20200119. Shhh! We mustn't talk about that. Ahh. Well, shall I tell you a story instead? Deal. Deal. Once upon a time, in a city far far away, the people were very good friends with the strangers. What are strangers like? Well, they're like... people but, but just the same as everyone else. Their eyes glow bright, in different colors. The king of the city, he didn't like this... and he was a stranger himself. But he wanted his eyes to glow alone. So he banished all the strangers from the city. For one day, this handsome inventor, came up with a device, a special machine. That could dim the glow of the eyes of the strangers. Now, of course this ment that no ones eyes could glow anymore. But, at least people could live together, equal you could say. But the king, he didn't want to be equal with anyone. So he ordered the inventor, to give him the machine. And then the inventor refused. Oh, everyone should listen to the king. Oh no no no no no my darling no. Now sometimes... in order to be a human being, you have to say no. Even to the king. I'm Spencer... whats your name? Abby. I'm hallucinating aren't I? Oh please, do not worry. I teach the new recruits, and I'm gonna teach you too. You see, sometimes things are not as they seem to be. Don't be afraid. There is this unique gift of, about 1 in 10 people possess. Something very special has awakened within you. Now you are one of the few that have it. This very special gift, awakens in people at different ages. Sometimes it infancy, and sometimes in adolescence. How old are you boy? - I'm a girl. - Ah wait. But there was a boy, that was snatched away from the faces. Never mind. But, but how do the inspectors not know about this place? Well, they are rather squeamish about coming here. To them we're the, scum of the earth. They don't want to spoil the human. They don't like the stench. Yeah but, where are we going? Uh, but uh, who are you? Mecus? Ah, anybody home? Once again, Mecus was my father, I am Marcus. How do you teach them new recruits with the memory of a goldfish? Ah fish, I like fish. Hmm. Look what we got here. Hello little lady, look at the amicus. Irreversible process. Typical case. So I did get infected. The epidemic. Epidemic? Did she say epidemic? Is she sick? We're all in danger. There is no epidemic. Epidemic is just a cover the authorities use to justify taking, anyone with a gift. Special gift is very powerful... and the authorities they don't like that. But what do they do with people they take away? They keep them somewhere. We don't know where. Ah, how many times do I have to tell you? Don't, touch anything, don't drink anything in my shop. Remember the time that... oh, of course, you don't remember anything. Stay here. Norman, where have you been? Have you fixed it? What the hell was that? You said you fixed it. Stop talking, go, and fix it. Now! Hmm. Inspectors! Run! The faceless. Run! The faceless, lets hide! Guys! Guys I'm so grateful, to you. If it wasn't for you, my heroes... this city, would be, a ghost town. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you guys. This is one of them. Let's get out of here before our uniforms start to stink. Let Marcus have a new girl. He needs a helper in his shop. Barney Barney, Barney Barney! This girl has an extraordinary gift. Power destroyed half the street. And she picked up an engine. You have to teach her. - I'm Bale. - Oh. I don't have time to babysit little girls. We attack the day after tomorrow. We need to get everyone ready. Only you can help her reach her full potential. I'm begging you. Only one training session. Just, look at her. Alright, one session. If she fails, don't ever ask me again. Take her to the base. Right. Now, follow me. The inspectors attack happened all of a sudden. We managed to get out, but Wesley, Reed, and Dao got captured. Our safe houses keep getting busted one after another. If it goes on like this, our entire network will soon be undermined. We have to hurry, or else the revolution will fail before it even starts. This uprising is a mistake. The timing couldn't be worse, we better lie low and wait. It's true, there aren't enough of us. That means that every one of us counts. We have enough parts to build engines. We'll be able to arm every single fighter. We aren't gonna win. We don't have enough people Bale. That's exactly why we have to strike as soon as possible. The uprising will begin the day after tomorrow. Tell everyone to get ready. That'll be all. I have to train a new recruit. You've never trained new recruits Bale. Follow me. Why are you doing this? My father was taken. I want to find him. And to do that, I have to learn to use my power. I teach you, it'll be for our cause. To liberate the city. - But my father... - I don't care about your father. You have ten seconds, choose your weapon. What? A weapon? I said, choose your weapon! Concentrate! Show me your power. I, I don't know how. You haven't explaned anything. You have five seconds. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. What did you do that for, I wasn't even ready! You can go and help Marcus in his shop. Fighting is not for you. You have my father's photograph on that board. Jonathan Foster, for you he's a criminal. I'm not staying here, I'm going to find him. If you try to go away, I'll find you. And hand you over inspectors myself. Garrett... what are you doing? I captured the sun beam. There just reflecting. If you don't believe me... you look for yourself. Where? It's just me. Wow! There's a girl! She just, flashed buy! That's the adult you, Abigail. In many many many many years... you can say hello to her too. I'm Spencer, I teach the new recruits, and I'm gonna teach you too. You can't help me. You will never accept me here. Bale and the others consider my father a criminal. I know you. It doesn't matter who your father is. You, are now one of us. Oh! No no no no this is to soon. You could hurt yourself. Why what is it? It's an engine. An engine? No, it's an engine, it focuses and directs our power. Well, the shape determines what they can do. For controlling nature, any of the elements you use an oval engine. But I like, the square ones better. They work on objects. And my favorite is... the triangular ones. They work on people, heal them, or kill them. For controlling nature. Any of the elements. You used an oval engine. - But I like the square ones. - Your stuck in a loop. Oh? Ahh. Yeah, let, let's continue. An engine, can, even act as, an object. For example, if you need to hide something. Wow! I need to go home. Who's, what, who's here? Right now. Ah, oh. For controlling nature, any of the elements, and you can use an, oval engine. Where are you going? I'm going home it's important. I forbade you to leave. Or what? Are you going to shoot me again? Are you always like that with the girls? You don't know how I am with the girls. It means you're only like that with me. I'm responsible for you. I don't like that. Yes you do. You just don't understand it yet. Just let me go. Leave her Bale, inspectors are coming. - Shut up. - What the hell! Why do you care about this one, so much? Let her go where she likes. If she's captured she could give us away. No there was something else here. I can see how you look at her . What the hell are you talking about? Where's the infection ship tomorrow, in what part of the city? - Fra, fra, from the West. - Make sure she doesn't come back. Enough Stella. She's a Foster's daughter, you know exactly what it means. That's not your decision. I've always supported you Bale. What's wrong with you, we're on the same side? You better trust someone you know more than a few minutes. Why am I suddenly an enemy? We belong together don't we? I don't feel that we're together anymore. Can I... go already? Abby! - Mom -How have you been? I was so worried. Mom, I know everything. The epidemic is a hoax. This subtitle created by Dandysubs on 20200119. And the inspectors are taking away the gifted ones. Did dad also have a special gift? And what about you? I'm not like you and Jonathan. But your father said that he would make sure that you would be safe. My amulet. Dad gave it to me. It was draining my power. And it saved my life when the inspector shot me. What? - When did this happen? - Mom don't worry I'm okay! I'm okay. How can I not worry? Now you have to hide that you are like this. You don't get it? We are not living our own lives. You can't find work, you're, barely surviving. I'm supposed to hide then, they took dad away. But for what? After all we didn't do anything bad. They deceived us, they forced us to be silent. And everyone pretended it's the way it should be. A whole city of lies. And if we put up with lies, it means we agree with them, to let them do anything at all with us. Free is the one who doesn't lie. I will find dad, I know where to look. Abby... just a while ago you were my little girl. You're all grown up. Mom, I need your advice . There are these people, very good people. And they're about to do something very big. And they know what they're doing. But my intuition tells me that they're making a mistake. We can't prove it, but, it's just a feeling. Just follow your heart my darling. I have faith in you... and you should have faith in yourself . Just be careful. Abby. Hey, I'm feeling a little off, can you check me? I will check her. What are you doing, are you crazy? Maybe you forgot that you're my pet inspector. Take the mask off. Take it off! If they catch you, that's it. Maybe we can call them all over here, and all three of you will dance for me. - It will be fun! - Stop it Abby. What do you need now? What is it? Sky fortress. And what's there? It's a prison for the special ones. After they've been caught, they're brought their. Are you sure. What if they're being killed? You can't kill the gift. It always returns to the city, to awaken in someone else. That's why they built the prison, and my father helped them. Abby, leave now if they catch you... What's this? Inside that thing there's a guide that will lead you to the fortress. - Now go. - Wait! You have to take me to the tunnel, the one that leads to the flying machine. And where do you think you'll fly to Abby? Beyond the boundaries of this city... there is an unknown and dangerous world. It's suicide to go there alone. I won't be alone. The inspectors are checking the tunnels the only way to get through, is during the shift change, at dawn or at midnight. Then we meet here, half an hour before midnight. Bale... I don't want to lose you. Not you, not any of the others. Stella you understand, to many of our people have been taken in. We can only defeat them on public safety day when they're spread around the city. If we don't strike tomorrow your project is finished. It's our only chance. - And then... - End of discussion. We attack at dawn. Our troops will gather here. Bale wait... there is no need for an uprising. This is the place where they hold everyone who was taken from the city. We can get there on this flying machine. And if we free them they will help us. Shut... up. I give the orders here. You can either follow them, or get out. But I know a way out of the city. If we leave this city, we won't stand a chance. Who are we going to find there anyway? Half of them were working for the authorities when they were taken. Whoever they are, I will not entrust the future of this city and the resistance to them. Look... even she doesn't want to go with you. We need to talk this through. Talk what through? How we're going to leave behind everyone living in the city? No, how to stay alive! We're at war. And I'm willing already to sacrifice any life including my own, for the sake of victory. And if you're not ready for that... you can leave, now. Why don't you want to tell us the real reason you want to go out from the city? Who are you trying to save, Abigail, Foster. I want to save my father. Don't you want to save your parents? - What if they are still... - Don't you dare talk about my parents! Your father... worked for the inspectors. Jonathan Foster, gave them the device, which they used, to identify and take all of my friends. You are not here to help us... you're here to use us. Do you really think I believe you? Get out. Are you sure the entrance to the tunnels is on this street? I'm sorry. I had no choice. Abigail. Hello. What's this? You changed a lot. Much, prettier now. I can't say the same about you, Garrett. Such a smart girl. You came up with a plan to trick me. Just like your father. Jonathan... did well hiding you from us. This amulet, suppressed your special gift. Your father didn't want you to have any powers. He realized that certain people should not be more powerful than others. And he designed a device, that can make everybody equal. You do believe in what your father was trying to achieve, don't you? I bet you're just as talented as he was. Join us. Together we can create, the city of equals. Where honest work and common decency are held the highest. Not some random gift of magic powers... blind and undeserved. Are you trying to recruit me? But I'm not anything like him And never will be. Roy. This is your chance to make up for what you've done. You have to kill her. I'm not a murderer. Kill her, or I will do it myself. Your turn Ian... prove that you won't have mercy on the traitors daughter. Bale. Marcus! Bale. Bale. God... oh God! It took me three years... to make this infusion. Now, not a single drop left. Come on, you can make more. Here... take it. Dab the scar. I grew it. I dried it. Infused it! And now, it's all gone. Bale forgive me please. Hey, keep it back, it's fine. Where did you go with that inspector? Is this instead of thank you? Thank you for what? You almost got us both killed! Because you wouldn't listen to me. It's you who should listen to me. - Why should I? - Because I saved your life. Actually, I saved you. If you would not gone there I wouldn't have had to risk everything for you. Can you listen to me for once? There's another way. How did you get it? My father left it for me. And inside of it, there is a guide who can lead us to the ones who are taken by the inspectors. Stop, don't open it. Why not? They're called fairies. Before the boundary was built they lived in the city with the gifted ones. But the inspectors forced them into service. But why don't you want it to be seen by everybody? Because now fairies are part of a different world. And we have to save ours. This is what I'm fighting for. - Ever since Garrett killed my parents... - Bale I'm sorry but... revenge won't, bring them back. But we can still see, those who are alive. Understand this, as soon as we cross the boundary we will want to stay there. And no one will care about this city. We have to liberate it. You're thinking only about your father... Yes, I haven't seen him for 10 years. And I don't know if he's still alive. And I follow my duty. Your faith is no foundation. Maybe it needs no foundation. But we should just... follow our hearts. My heart wants you to stay here in safety. I can't stay here, no matter how much I want to. You and I are on different paths. I have no right to hold you here. And I hope... you will change your mind. What was that? - Something flashed! - Where? Just like a fire. That's not how fire burns. But... how does it burn? Well, in order to light a flame... you need, three friends. Now, the first, friend, is... a fuel. And a fuel, is what will burn. But the second friend, is... air. And air will feed, the fire. But the third friend... is a spark. And she likes to, play, and fool around. Just like you. And without her, air and fuel can't be the flame. There friends, but they do everything together. Just like life. You have to find two friends, with which you can overcome any obstacle. Because alone... you won't get very far. Bale! It's a trap! There expecting you! There are too many inspectors. They came from beyond the boundary. Fall back! Everybody fall back! Confused... aren't you? This subtitle created by Dandysubs on 20200119. You would have had us all killed but I found the only sensible solution Stabbing us all in the back! More like saving everyone's back. It hurts me so much... to see how the man I loved, turned into an obsessed fanatic. All these years you've been toxicated by a thirst for power. You've drawn the whole city in blood. You're kind of teir, would be something the inspectors could never have imagined. But it was you who drowned the city in blood. Enough. Take it away. Move! Get in! What are you doing? We lost. It's the end. The inspectors will be here soon. Yeah but what about our friends? The ones that have been taken prisoner, we have to get them out. Why are you giving up? You don't have to give up. We still have a chance to fix everything. Listen to me! We can all run off and hide now but that's not right. And we can only win, if we believe in what we are fighting for. This is our chance. We'll get out of the city and save our friends. We'll find all of our kind everyone who was taken by the inspectors and this fairy will show us the way to them. I have no right to tell you what to do. You should all decide for yourselves. But I'm going... and if the words hope and freedom mean anything to you, then come with me. You have to come with us Spencer. I'm an old man. What am I gonna do? This is my home... and, I love this city and I've grown so fond of this basement. I'm staying. No please you have to come with us. My dear Abby, I'm sure you can manage without me. And you remembered my name after all. And I shall never forget Magna. Bale. You're alive. We half to hurry. Watch the tunnel. Looks like we're inside the flying machine. Norman, can you make it fly? What a strange weapon. Why aren't they wearing masks? Inspectors in the tunnel! Figure out how to fly this! Look, there's a key hole. When I was little my dad used to tell me a story about outsiders who lived beyond the boundary. I'm scared. What if I was wrong, and we're flying into a trap? What if you're right, and when we get there we're only going to find traitors working for the security department. And what if my father is working for the inspectors too? It doesn't matter what we find. What only matters is that we have a new hope... and it's driving us forward. You're all here... only because you have faith in what your heart was telling you. Give me your hands. Concentrate. Trust your power. Feel it. You must have faith in yourself. What's going on? The engines stopped working. We don't have a choice. We have to go there and see what's going on. Who the hell are you? Drop your weapons, now! Okay everybody spread out. Search the building for Jonathan Foster. Don't touch him. He's barely alive. Looks like his life force has been sucked out of him. We searched the whole place. Jonathan Foster's not here. My father's not here. You were right. My father created the device that takes away the powers from those who have them. When I was little... he gave me an amulet that suppressed my abilities. But this device is much more powerful. Well it's not that simple. Looks like we need all our powers to destroy it. Well we've lost them. We need to have a look around, let's go. Dad? Daddy! I was looking for you for so long! I've gone through so much! Well well. Abby... quiet. Now... I am here. Where are we? It's like my memories. You're on the right path, navigator. I looked at the watch, and I ended up here. Engine. What, did you act upon me? But what did he do? What for? Remember I can only point you in the right direction. I just wanted you to come back. It's just a recording. Oh... you put the sentences into my memories. Hints. Anything... can happen. Even things that can't. All you need to do... is to believe. Now, keep your head up Higher, higher... keep it high. Keep your head up. That's what he always used to tell me. Look, this arrow was pointing there. There must be something. The sunbeam is shining on that wall. Dad? Did you leave me a hint? Abigail! My joy! You're here. I found the force. How can I turn off the device that takes away the power from the special ones? I can only point you in the right direction. Remember what I said. You said, mmm, something about three friends. I need three things. Walls! Walls? So, you drew. There engines! Engines of all different kinds! Bravo, right on the nose. They all do everything together. That means that we've got to somehow bring them together! I captured the sunbeams. - I captured the sun... - The mirror! It can focus their beams. We need to combine the beams from three types of engines. Put the engines together, so that they point at the lens. If you focus their beams into a single beam, that will destroy the device. Abby, Norman, the inspectors will be here soon. Bale, my dad knew that I would come here. He left some clues for me to show how to neutralize the device and bring our power back. But we need time. Okay we'll buy some time for you. Norman... help Abby. Dad, what are you trying to tell me? Dad? I did everything that you said! But the engines don't work! I found the mirror, and the engines. But without the power nothing will work. Where are you? Quiet Abigail, I'm here. Shhh. I'm here with you. Where are you dad? Tell me. Have you done it? Ah. And why should I do it? So that you can rid the world, not just of the special ones, but of their gift as well? So that you can have a weapon, that could destroy the gift itself? Because... it was my request. It's your order. Be honest, Garrett. What's wrong Jonathan? We're colleagues after all. The equality... that we achieved... is a balance. Only power can change it... and I have this power. The power, is me. It doesn't belong, to anyone. One day... I will become part of this power. It will return and awaken in everyone. this will be a city of equals of the strong, not the weak. Just do what I asked you to. And don't forget about your daughter. Think about her. Yes. Yes, you're right. I have a daughter... and I think of her... every minute. And that is why I say... not, this... time. What bonds you? No! I'll always be here with you. We need you! You have to let me go. And you have to go back too soon. Because it's the only way to unload the power. Norman is gone. But it's only in my memories. Help me destroy the device. He had so much faith in me. Bale? Go back to myself. I get it. I know how to do it. As a child I had special powers. And my dad taught me to summon them from inside myself. Bale. Garrett, this is it. Dad, what's across the border? Shhh. We mustn't talk about that. We can talk about that. You need to. But now, everything is changed dad. Abigail. I knew you'd pull through. Thanks to you. It's good that at least in my memories I can see you. I will always be with you... in your heart. The new history of our city begins here, today. It's time to go home. Norman, we're going home. And the next stop is, is Fencington. What, no no no no no no no no. This subtitle created by Dandysubs on 20200119.
