Don Licata, please! Shut up! We have to go now, there's something wrong, but I don't understand what exactly. It's very strange. Okay, let's go. Don Licata... And who will I practice my English with? Find yourself a pretty tourist. Or maybe, read a book. My chain! You saved my life, this... will help me remember that. Honor our family. And in memory of our father! You take care of mom. Excuse me, Prof. Kemp. Is the calculation right? Yes, sure. - All right. - Thank you. Professor, I can't wait to try these equipments. I would like to remind you, Licata, that this is a research laboratory. We do an important and confidential job. It requires a lot of dedication, perseverance, and... humility. A prodigy, with the Isaac Newton complex... ...is the last thing we need. Did I make myself clear? Yes, sorry, I... ...I just can't wait to start working. I see. You see, there are already many Isaac Newton types. Emily, this is Tony Licata, I've already told you about him. - You take care of him. - Nice to meet you. - Welcome. - Thank you. Well, see you later. Why don't you sit down? Did you study with Prof. Kemp? Yes! Yes. He's a brilliant man, but sometimes... ...he's got a temper... Really? I'm his daughter, Emily Kemp. What's happening? It took me 20 years to avenge my father. But a Licata never forgets. It was just business. You should understand it. You're one of us! Nicola, your brother wrote. Isn't our Antonio, good? Too bad I never see him. Mom, I have to leave. And where are you going? To America. America? America... No, I'm sorry, I can't transfer any phone calls to the President. - Good morning. - May I help you? - I'm Nick Licata. I have an appointment. Licata, Licata... Please have a seat. Thank you. Hudson Export. May I help you? No, I'm sorry. Today it is not possible. No, call back tomorrow. See you later. - Mr. Licata? - Yes. Matthew Cage. Welcome to America. - Did you have a good trip? - It was great. Thanks. I'm sure you would like to freshen up. but I'm afraid you have an appointment with Mr. Warren. - Right. When you finish, I will show you your apartment. I did not know if you wanted a pool, it's a very subjective thing and I wasn't sure about the car, either. I followed Mr. Warren's taste, but if there are any problems... Excuse me, who is Mr. Warren? Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Warren is the president. And what is he like? It's the type of question I do not answer, usually. - He runs Hudson, but works for Crown. - Crown? The financial company we are attached to. Listen, would you answer a question that concerns you? It depends. What are you like? I'm accommodating. Do not worry, you will learn soon. There will be a written exam, after the meeting. This is Mr. Cullough. We've been waiting for you, Mr. Licata, you're late. And... I'll introduce you to... Mr. Warren. I hate the smell of the office. Okay Cullough, let's get going. Good, Mr. Licata. As you will certainly know, we deal with microelectronics. We buy obsolete components from the most prestigious American and Japanese companies. and we resell them to European companies, whose underdevelopment in the field of microelectronics, is definitely an advantage for us. Now, we have a problem with a scientific organization in London, called "EMP Research", which works with European factories, offering consulting services, and discouraging them from buying our products. As you can understand, this is a disturbing element for Hudson's business. - Yes, yes, yes, it's all very interesting, but let's try to get to the point. We had you come here, Mr. Licata, because you have a certain reputation. The reputation of someone who solves... thorny issues... EMP Research is making our life... ...very difficult. We have to get them to stop interfering with our business. My intuition, tells me that you're the right man to stop them. I hope I'm not wrong. I count on you. Don't let me down, Licata. - Like I said, ladies are... - Yes, yes, I understand... I hope we will find the way... to help... - Thank you very much! - Mr. Warren is our benefactor... When it's possible, father... You're Sicilian, aren't you? Yes, indeed, how do you know? I imagined. From the way you look at women. Nobody in the world looks at a woman like you do. But I'm not Sicilian, so I don't look down. You're right, I should be the one to look down. Someone said that money is the father of all risks. and their mother is a beautiful woman. - What do you think? - That they must have been wise, but they must have had a very boring life. Perhaps, but be careful. - You're playing with fire, Nick. - Why? You don't know? She's the president's wife. Good luck. - And where are you from? - I'm from Stockholm. - Wonderful city. - Thanks, I'm here on vacation. - And do you like America? - A lot, I hope to come back soon. Are you staying at some friends' house? My cousin is the Swedish Consul here. Is there anyone here? You seem like you're not having much fun at the party, Mr. Licata, so, I thought of inviting you in a quieter environment. I was much quieter out there, madam. What happened to your Sicilian arrogance? Why don't you jump in the water and save me from so much boredom? I think it's too late to change my life, Mrs. Warren and it's too soon to be part of yours. Do you have rhythm? You see, I have a lot of rhythm. Are you interested? - No... - What's wrong with you? Are you leaving? You look a bit tense. Yeah, you're even sweating. Do you want to dry off with this? - Really? - Yes. Sorry, I've got to take care of something, I'll be right back. Do you know him? Yes, it's been years. - It's Warren's right hand. - Even the left, sometimes. Mrs. Warren... ...your husband would like you to take care of your guests. Tell him that I will be there right away. You can go, Cullough. - Everybody is here. - Very well. - This is to adjust it, professor. - Ah, thank you, thank you. Well, as president of EMP Research I would like to thank you for dedicating part of your time to our organization. I know from experience that time is a rare commodity in our field. One of our main goals, is to prevent obsolete and unreliable... ...materials, from being sold to European companies, and also, help our companies to choose only advanced components and quality microelectronics components, that are necessary for industrial growth. With our research, we will soon be able to allow the European industry, to reach a competitive international level. But in the meantime, our efforts will all be addressed to prevent any form of speculation from those who dominate our markets. And until I'm president of this organization, I will do everything I can to prevent the import of obsolete materials that damage our factories. Prof. Iki Shomuro, will support me in this difficult and strenuous battle against those who speculate on our work. Thank you. Hurry up! It's Nicola, calling from America. No, no, madam, today he wants to talk to Michele. London? All right. I don't get it. It doesn't look like him, it's so... irrational. He really cared about his job. He should have left a note. I forgive him everything, but he had to leave at least one note. How can I accept his death, if I do not know why he died? I know, Emily... I know. We must continue his work. Please help me. I love this country. One grows very quickly. Tons of money, classy women, it's... The life I've always dreamed of. Yes, I hear you, everyone has their taste. I prefer to stay in the shade. Seriously? You have been around for a long time. I don't understand, you could get to the top, why don't you care? Power wears you out. Actually, I do not know what to do with the top. I'm like my father, I think. He worked with the same company for 40 years, as a loyal dog. I'm just as loyal as him. Matthew, I have big things in mind to get to the top of this company and I need a friend to rely on. Anytime. Great! Where was your father working? In a slaughterhouse. I would like to stress that Hudson Export has always had a transparent image, a tradition of... discipline and respect for its managers. You shouldn't have acted without consulting us. Here, if someone does not follow the rules, he will be fired. Look, Kemp committed suicide. The British police have already closed the case. He wasn't a corrupt man. He was an obstacle and had to be eliminated. Were we supposed to wait until he died of pneumonia? - This man is dangerous. - Cullough! Please. Mr. Warren. You had a problem, and I solved it. That's it. Rather, let's think about the future. I see very advantageous prospects for our group. And that is? Well... ...the Europeans buy a lot less material than they would like. It is due to lack of resources. Mr. Warren, we already pay many excellent business advisors. Why should we listen to someone who has no experience in this field? - Cullough! Why don't you shut up? Continue, Nicolas. Crown is a financial company, right? We'll let them lend money to the European companies so they can buy more from Hudson, so basically, we will pay ourselves. Then we'll wait. When they will be filled with debts, we will buy them off for little money. But it's ridiculous! Mr. Warren, this idea can open the door to the Crown's Board. Look, I don't like you... ...dear Licata. But you've got some... ...wonderful ideas. I don't approve, Michael. And I won't have anything to do with this proposal. - The whole conference room just for you? - Yeah! Everyone has the space they deserve. - Hello. - Good morning. You see, With these diagrams around. I'm always aware of the situation. I know, I could use the computer, but... ...this is more immediate. We need your help, Iki. I felt sorry for your father, Emily. Nobody expected it. Well, we would like to continue his research, but... ...we do not have the necessary means. - Do you have any proposals? - Yes, we would like to work with you. We will help you... if EMP Research will fund the laboratory. I warn you that we are very demanding our group has the best scientists in the industry to offer advice to our factories. We'll be able to do it, I promise you. But there's more. Working with us can be very dangerous. - Seriously? - Oh yeah. Unfortunately, we are often threatened. Well, anyway, we are determined to continue my father's studies. Well, I respect this, but do not forget that you might take risks. All right. Mr. Cullough was... ...very unlucky. Don't you agree, Nick? But I doubt, that someone regrets him. Well, I certainly don't. Mr. Warren! My jacket. Here it is. Is it better? Yes. It's always the heart. Sometimes he takes a vacation without telling me. Nothing serious. I would say that it is serious. Don't worry. It's just God reminding me, from time to time, that I am human. But I would be very grateful if this little incident... ...remained between us. I hope that in the future, so many decisions will remain between us. I have to admit it, Nicolas. You have a lot of courage. And you are smart and ambitious. I'm just worried about your methods. I don't know better ones, Mr. Warren. Why did you make me come here? My husband is sleeping. - Something to drink? - No, thanks. What do you want? I've got a surprise for you. What is that? Your future is in this disk... ...and your success too. - Give me that. - But there's a price. - What do I have to do? - Earn it! All right, I'll pay you. Give me that. So? Mr. Warren is a bit impulsive. Why? He has planned all his negotiations in advance. Businesses, percentages, it's all in here. It will be a piece of cake. I deserve a prize, then. I want to see you get to the top. President of the Hudson Export Company. You will be my prize. Mr. Warren offered you 10% of the sales profits, Mr. Guttenberg. And you're thinking of offering me more, right, Mr. Licata? I'll show you the contract, sir. 4%? But it's not even half! Is this a joke? Am I laughing? But I would not accept 4%, not even from my mother! She didn't not offer it. Go away, I'll talk to Mr. Warren. Sorry but, isn't it a bit cold? Well, this environment should be warmed up a little. What do you mean, warmed up? All right, all right, stop them. Let's discuss it, Mr. Licata. 8% for me... will be fine, all right. Four percent. My pen. Thank you. See you later. Son of a bitch. It's just water, do not worry. - Do you like onions? - Yes. Anyway, when I went to college, I was going crazy. I was always studying, all day long, and I often studied at night. All the time, the only thing I wanted was to become like him. I did not have a life except for studying. You are a good researcher, and your father was an extraordinary model. - Yes, of course. Only I could not compete with him. Now I realize that in life there is more... ...than collecting prizes to fill... ...that famous showcase. I mean, what's the point? You want to give up now? Are you kidding? I love my job. Excuse me, I would like to go through. It's just that... I have to find my balance. Think of a normal life, Simple things, Feelings, and maybe... have a baby. - I see. - Yes? And you know what? You too should think a little about yourself, you're always in front of that damn computer. I know, yes, it's an obsession but... ...However... I assure you, I can be different! - Really? - Yes, I swear! I... I have dreams too, and I... I have impulses, and I... - Yes. - Oh, I love impulses. One more kiss, before you go back to your computer. Don't be silly! I would like to finish the work on microchips tomorrow. What's so funny? Nothing... just that I was thinking that... ...when we make love, or... ...when we talk about ourselves, about our future... How can you think of those damn microchips... just two seconds after we made love? Go ahead. Hello? Nico! Nice to hear from you, but how did you find me? When? How? Yes, I will catch the first flight, of course. Okay, Bye. What happened? My mother is dead. Oh, Tony, I'm so sorry. Here we are. We are the only family members left now. That was our wheelbarrow, wasn't it? It was my wheelbarrow. Do you remember when... ...you forced me to speak English? You were already a pain. It was useful, wasn't it? We've been far apart too long, Tony. Listen, come to America. You will be a researcher for Hudson Export. You know I can't do it, Nico. - Why not, it would be perfect! - What are you talking about? Hudson Export sells waste products to struggling European companies. then waits for them to get to the bottom. And what's wrong, business is business! Which business! Hindering scientific research in Europe is not business, it is mafia. You're stupid, you know that? Watch out. That's how you treat your brother, now that you're a big guy in America. I'm leaving. All right. Thanks Maria. Sicily is beautiful, but too hot. How can you wear a jacket? Peasants' habits. My taxi is here. Why? Where are you going? I have to meet some Italian colleagues. There's a conference in the city, I'll be gone for a couple of hours. I'll take you out for dinner. Every time... that Tony starts talking about his job, he forgets about the rest. Do you wanna dance? Are you kidding? I love this place. One day... ...I'll buy it, with the beach and everything else. I will name it after you. Villa Emilia. You are a dreamer. Yes, maybe, but what is life without dreams? Reality does not exist, it is only an interval between dreams. They say that dreams are desires. Maybe. And unfortunately the forbidden ones are always the most beautiful. It's true you're right. It is Sicily that gets you drunk. It's so beautiful. Calm down. Wait, stop! Tony, finally! We only... Come on Tony, get it over with. We took a walk, what's the problem? - What's wrong with you? - Leave me alone! What is it, are you afraid? Are you afraid that your girlfriend doesn't care about you anymore? It's true? You're jealous! You're jealous, aren't you? You're jealous! Do you want to fight? Alright then. Having Nicolas Licata come from Sicily, was a stroke of genius on my part. We finally got rid of Cullough. And now, thanks to the idea of financing our customers, Crown considers me a prodigy. They want to see me. That means... ...a place on the board of directors. So... Cheers to your admittance to the Finance Olympus. Thank you. And when we'll move to the Bahamas... ...we will live like Greek Gods. So, I will call you Jupiter. It won't be an easy discussion, Mr. Warren. and I'm sorry that things have come to this point. But, you leave us no choice. It is a pity that your negotiations with our most important customers weren't as as profitable as expected. What do you mean? Which negotiations? Well, you offered 10% to all customers. and no one accepted it. It was very unusual, since the contracts have been stipulated at only 4%. And how? Who did it? We must remind you that Crown's interests have absolute priority and therefore... ...we must ask you to leave the presidency of Hudson Export. Who did it? Who cheated me? I swear God I'll kill him! I'll kill that son of a bitch! Nick Licata proved to be very skilled, and with fantastic business acumen. As the new president... - The investigation is closed. - But it's ridiculous! Can you believe it? Two of the most famous researchers in the world! Both presidents of the same organization, both mysteriously died in a short time, and... ...and according to them there is nothing to investigate, fuck them! Ian, find Prof. Kemp and Iki Shomuro's reports. No! All microelectronics analysis, I want the customers ones, everything! And quickly. Ian. Listen, have you seen Prof. Licata? - So, did you find those documents? - Yes. - Are these, the ones? - Yes. - I was looking for you. Is everything here? - Tony! - I think so. I need to talk to you, I have important things to tell you. And where's the computer disk? It's over there in my office. Please, Tony! Go ahead, I'm listening. - Hudson Export! - What? What's that got to do with it? Both Prof. Kemp and Iki Shomuro, gave a negative opinion on Hudson Export's materials. Mark, call that policeman, friend of yours. - They will be forced to reopen the case. - I'll do it right away. No, no, it's not a problem, EMP Research will not bother us anymore. The European market is all ours, now we can also target the Japanese one. Of course, the Crown Board will be interested! Yes, yes, I'll take care of it. See you later. It's all great Nick, but don't you think you're running too much? Stop for a moment, take a breath. What do you mean take a breath? I'm just starting! By the end of the month, I will convince Crown to appoint me as president of their other companies. In a short while, - I will make them earn so much money... - But I must warn you... ...Many people around you don't appreciate your methods. - They will do anything to stop you. - Really? I see. Thanks, Matthew. Good morning darling! Oh, hello Matthew! Can you please check if my car has arrived? Anything for you. Your projects are interesting, Nick. Yes, I think so too. Don't you think you're aiming too low? Too low? I thought you were aiming for real power. - What do you mean? - The Crown, honey. The real money is there. I know, what should I do? Well, first of all, there's that pain-in-the-ass brother of yours. They say he will replace Iki Shomuro. Do not worry about Tony, he will not stand against me. Grace. Are you saying you could get me to Crown? If you will indulge me. Professor! Wait! Hey, where are you going? Prof. Licata! Your brother Nicola wants you to go to Australia, here's the money. Tell that bastard... ...that I'll send him to jail, do you understand? Tell him! Tell him! Hello, Mark! Kemp and Iki have been killed, now I'm sure. It is certainly due to Hudson Export. Yes, of course. My brother is involved, call your policeman friend. Tony! What is happening? Now, stop it, we have to stop avoiding each other. You have to quit ignoring me! We have nothing to say to each other. Well, I have something to tell you, and it's important. Take a seat. You must explain to me... ...why you are so obsessed with fighting your brother. It's not an obsession, it's a matter of principle, he's a gangster! The thought of ruining him, seems to give you great pleasure, doesn't it? Is it a revenge for what happened that night in Sicily? Because, if that's the case... ...I would be just as responsible, am I clear? And somehow, you would be, too! What are you talking about? I've tried to send you signals! I felt alone, and you remained locked in your world! You still don't get that I love you? You can't destroy your brother. You would never forgive yourself. And I don't want to see you suffer. I love you. You did not come for breakfast, is this a new habit? I'm sick of looking at your worried face. - I prefer to eat alone. - Really? And what should I be worried about? Did you take a look at yourself? You don't do anything without... worrying about what your brother is doing. What's the matter with you? You're afraid he will tell something and will ruin your wonderful lifestyle? What happened to you, Nick? What happened to the man who took over Warren and Cullough? The man who is about to join the Crown Board? Will you let Tony dictate your moves, or will you do something? You're talking bullshit. - Really? - Of course... Well, I don't see it that way, dear. It seems to me that someone stole poor Nick's candy. I thought you were a man, I thought you had balls! What happened to them? Do you still have them, or did your brother get those too? I still have them, all right. Do you feel them, Grace? Yes. Then, use them. Use them, do you understand? Use them, before everyone sees you like a coward! What wonderful news! Nobody will have to buy stuff from the Americans anymore! Nobody will buy anything from Hudson Export anymore. You are a genius! How are you? - Emily answer to me! - I'm fine. Come on, let's get out of here. - But where are you going? - The disk! - Our work, we can't lose it! - Quickly, hurry up! There's someone there. Damn it, Larry! Go look. - What happened? - I hit Larry, by mistake! I'll help you, let's run away. What beautiful firework. What's going on, Nick? Matthew! Come and have a drink. - I'm celebrating. - What? My past, my present, - and my future. - Time to go to bed, come on. How did I become such a son of a bitch? Why? Listen, What did I do wrong? You understand me? And say something for God's sake! Come on, calm down now. No, no, no. Don't do that. It's all right, calm down, I'm here. Come on... Let it out... Ugly... ...Bastard! Maybe you need these, Ian? You know I'm rather distracted and I can't use this tool. - So tell me everything now. - But... I don't know anything. Wait. That's where the bullet comes out, right? Here, yes. Then you pull this. Professor, don't... Here, like that. No, no, don't shoot me. I only followed the orders. I had to set fire and I did it. - Who gave you the orders? - I can't tell you. Bastard, don't make fun of me, who gave you orders? I want to know who gave you the orders! Michele, his name is Michele. He's Sicilian, too. But please now let me go, I already have enough trouble. - You will come to the police with me! - No! - Come on, move! - No, please! You have done a wonderful job thanks to you, Crown has earned huge sums. we think we have to give you a reward. Our only doubt is that some of your methods somehow lack... ...how could I say... tact. But you proved to be a promising element and according to the Board, the Crown needs new blood. You and your revolutionary ideas and your great determination seem to be the right man. However, we have a problem. We have heard of a discovery which has recently been improved in Europe. Apparently, it will revolutionize their production of microelectronics. This discovery will damage our interests on the world market. It's simple. Either, we buy the patent, or we destroy the inventor. Nick, the inventor is your brother. Prof. Licata. What are you doing here? Mrs. Warren has always been one of the most precious... pawns of Crown's chessboard and we owe her a lot. Mr. Licata has never betrayed my trust... and I'm sure Crown's interests have priority over his personal and family interests. He knows very well that it's just business. Yes, I'll fix everything. In person. - Why did you want to see me? - I missed you. We should see each other more often. Mom would be happy about that. He did not want us to fight. What do you want? I want to help you. - I do not want your help. - Why do you make things difficult for me? - We have nothing to say to each other. - Wait, listen. I'm jealous of you, okay? I'm really jealous. - Well, it's your problem. - Your job... ...unlike mine, has a purpose. In my job, you make the wrong move, and suddenly... ...nobody knows you anymore. Listen, I also want to participate in what you do. You... you want to participate... ...and then you send someone to set fire to my laboratory? I swear to God... I swear on our mother's grave that I did not know you were inside, believe me. Forget the lab, you'll have ten more. If you come to America, we'll do great things together! Don't worry about the money, you will do what you want, it will be like a family thing! The Licata Institute, call it what you want, but say yes. Okay? Tony, Tonino, please... - Would you like to buy me an institute? - Yes! And do you think it's enough? Are you out of your mind? Do you want to buy me? I do not want to buy you, you're my brother, I want you near me. - I do not want to be near you! - Oh, and why, why? Is it still because of that girl? A nice ass is more important than your brother? It's too late, Nick. You're not my brother, anymore. Do you want to see me dead? Hanged like Iki? Or shot, like Kemp? And what will you get, more money... ...more power. Tell me! You'll kill me, so you will have more money and more power! I feel sorry for you, Nick. So, how did it go? - Matthew, what are you doing here? - Did it go well? No, badly. You need company. But how the hell do you do it? How come you always know what I'm thinking? It's nerve-racking. - Well, this is my job. - Yeah. You're really a nice bastard. - Thank you. - You are welcome. So, Tony will not do as you wish. I'm afraid not. Okay.. In this case, I do not think you'll want to hear what I'm about to tell you. Come on, hit on. Tomorrow, your brother will leave for Sicily. There will be a conference. He will present his discovery. But there is a rumor that he will also speak about the murders. It seems that he will name names. He'll mention you, Hudson, Crown... everyone. Damn it... How do you know? I heard it around. They do not trust you anymore, - They will act directly. - She... She hired a killer to kill him in Sicily. Who? Grace... She's always used you, Nick. - Good morning, welcome to our hotel, Prof. Licata. - Grace Warren's speaking. - Job done. Sorry for interrupting, Prof. Smith. Look, there's a mistake, I'm Prof. Licata. Prof. Licata... is dead, Prof. Smith. Look at the passport. It's in your name. Nick left you this. To explain everything. Your brother was a man of honor. I know that you too will want to remember him as such. "I think I understood it in London, Tony" "that you were right as always." "Your job has a purpose" "and I had never thought about it before." "I had to choose between you and I" "and you're the one that's worth more" "who understood the right path to follow" "that truly honors our family." "If you follow my instructions, you can destroy Crown" "and get on with your work". "But... please remain Mr. Smith" "or the Licata family... will be over with you." "Good luck." "Nick." "My chain." "You saved my life, this... will help me remember." I feel like... ...like... ...I never really tried to understand him. Nick loved you very much. Yes, I know. Tony... Do you remember that night in London after the fire? Sure. Well... ...I'm pregnant.
