All you do is spend like American women. [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] I think she's calming him down. Fuck yourself, Branca. WIFE: [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] I'll kill her. I swear to god. I 'll kill her. [speaking spanish] All right, sweetheart. Just a little more to your left. Little more. That's it. Audios, mother fucker. [gunshot] WIFE: No, Jimmy! No. SAM: We should have shot that. NICK: You know, when it rains, it pours for you, Sam. Why don't you just slice me open and dump some salt in the wounds? [police scanner transmitting] Hey, Buddy. Hey, buddy. WAITRESS: Hi. Hi. Could I get a couple of hard-boiled eggs? WAITRESS: Sure. Blue plate special. WAITRESS: OK. Why don't you have the t-bone steaks? Eddies buying. The guy you handed the story to, assholes. [music playing] I've been listening to his story all night. I was praying that the two assholes he was referring to weren't you two assholes. Buddy? If you'd been there, you'd understand. Understand? Understand? What do you want from me, guys? I sit here and listen to these radios all night just like you guys. I hear calls in certain sectors of the city. I check the map, see it's in the sector the best team I got out there, and I started rooting and cheering inside. You see? I visualize my men driving, weaving in and out of traffic just to get to that great story. My heart pounds with excitement, and I get a feeling, a little knot down deep in my gut, that tells me that cameras are rolling. And then I sit back, and I wait for my first string to come through that door, smiling, and sit across from me and tell me all about it. But tonight, some hot shot comes in here and starts shooting off his mouth about two assholes who handed him a $10,000 story. Don't you ever, ever humiliate yourselves or me again. You understand? Hey? Case closed. Buddy, for God's sakes. Closed. WAITRESS: Here, I brought you a Band-Aid. Oh, no. That's all right. Oh, come on. Could I have a cup of coffee, please? [music playing] Oh, how's it feeling? Hurts. Yeah? Let me see it. Ow. Oh, come here. Let me kiss it. Make it all better? Is that better? Yeah, a lot. Yeah? Yeah. This'll make it a lot better. SAM: Hey, you're in early today. Hey, yeah. You got an aspirin? What? You got a headache? No, Sam, I'm asking you because I'm hungry. Cute. Rough night out with that waitress? Yeah. Why don't you just gave me a couple of your leftovers, eh? You can have them all, Sam. What did this girl do to you? No more one-nighters for me. I'm settling down. Oh yeah?

Oh, come on, Nicky. - All right. - Stay. You talked me into it. As long as I'm here. OK. So what's the matter, son? There's usually two reasons why you come to see me, because you have a problem or because you have a problem. So what's your problem? I don't have a problem. I just wanted to see you. Look at me. Look at me. work? No Friends? No. Girls? See? I told you to stop seeing those models and actresses. A nice girl like Mrs. Matuse's daughter would be perfect. Mom, don't do that. I don't want you to fix me up with a girl. A girl? No. A neighborhood girl, yes. Forget it. I don't need any help with girls, mom. Just last night, I had a wonderful date with a lovely girl. What does she do for a living? She's a waitress. Oh, that's OK. I used to be a waitress for your Uncle Joey. I didn't know Uncle Joey had a restaurant. He didn't, but I used to wait on the bastard hand and foot. So what did you two talk about? Talk? Your date. You and the waitress. Oh, yeah. We talk. We talk a lot. I know what you talked about. You know, Angelina Matuse, that's a girl you could talk to. Ma, why do you keep talking about Angelina Matuse? You make her sound like she teaches blind kids. I bet you $200 you forgot the waitress's name. [doorbell rings] Yeah, well, I gave up gambling, ma. Why don't you answer your doorbell? ROSE: Angelina. Hi. I made these stuffed eggplants for you.

I plan on sharing it with him. [snaps] Get in. [car starts] What the hell is this? That's it. What? Take it, Sam. Still got the best of the old sector. You want us to increase our numbers, and at the same time, you-- you cut our action into thirds? Come on, Sam. Bring me some hot numbers, I give you your sector back. [scoffs] Hey. You and Nick? The greatest. But the word is, the kid's gone soft. You see it. You know. Now, toughen him up. The few swings you guys got in on Eddie last night, it's a start. Jesus, you're not fair at all. I never said I was. And who is, anyway? Wake up, Sam. Wake the kid up. Now, come on. Get out of my face and go bring me a story. We don't find any news out there, we're going to have to start making it ourselves. [laughs] Right? SAM: Son of a bitch. That- that piece of shit. I can't believe that guy. NICK: Yeah, but you gotta learn to relax, buddy. SAM: What are you talking about, relax? He cuts our sector by third, and now he wants more sales? NICK: We're going to give it to him. I'm going to make sure that piece of shit, Eddie Colfax, never gets a chance to turn his camera on. SAM: Yeah? Well, how are we going to do that? We'll cross the sectors. Ah, Come on, Nick. We can't cross sectors. Why not? If we cross sectors and miss a story in our own sector, we'll be in deep shit. That's why. It'll never happen. Oh yeah? Well, what if it does. Sam, we're not going to be the only ones crossing sectors. You sure? Yeah. Ah, jeeze, only one cookie left. You want it? - No - Good. I got a Twinkie. I got a Snicker. You can have anything you want.

Nick? NIck's a great kid. You know, he's got the largest and the toughest sector in this town. There's no one that I have more respect for in my organization than Nick Branca. Hey Nick, congratulations. Come on over here. Say a few words to the beautiful lady. REPORTER: Mr. Branca, how does it feel? How does what feel? Well, you've been touted by the mayor as a prominent, courageous citizen. The police commissioner's office has awarded you a citation for valor. The station's being flooded with calls from every political official in the state. What are you going to do now? Going to Disneyland. [crowd laughs] I'm just doing my job. You know, in video journalism, we report a lot about death. In fact, death is probably the staple of all our financial success. It's really great to be able to nail a story about someone's life being saved as opposed to someone's life being taken. It was nothing. I mean, I'm sure if anyone else was there, they would've done the same thing. Oh, heroes are hard to come by, but modest heroes? Very scarce. I'm glad to hear that this unsung hero's song is being heard all over the country. This is Liz Brown reporting from downtown Los Angeles. How'd it look, guys? CREW MEMBER: Great. - OK? Good. That's a wrap. [sighs] Nick, it's really nice to know guys like you are working behind the scenes. Oh, thank you, Liz. Come on, Nick. We've got to talk. Just a minute buddy. So Liz Brown, what are the chances of me seeing you again? Other than on the news. Well, um-- BUDDY: Nick, we got to go-- I'm coming, Buddy. I think you better get going. What the hell's going on? Oh, she just tried to pick me up. Yeah? Well, keep your head on your shoulders and out of the girls pussies for the next couple of weeks. We got a busy schedule ahead of you. What are you talking about? In between accepting certificates and medals and plaques, you're going to be nailing stories. Buddy, look. I just do what I do. All right? - Oh, not anymore, kid. We're going for the big time now. You're a hero. Heroes can't just do what they do. Heroes can't die. Heroes stand up and salute the flag. People love heroes. Hell, a story reported by you now is worth two, three times what it was before. Wait a minute, all right? Don't you think you're blowing this a little bit out of proportion? No, I don't. You're hot, kid. You're on fire, and it's my job to make sure that the flame don't go out. But don't worry, kid. I'm on your side. I'm going to make sure that my hero gets to report the news that's fitting for a hero. See you tomorrow, Buddy. Hey, get some sleep, kid. Well, nice going, hero. Hey, I'm proud of you. Proud to be your partner. Cut the shit, Sam. Go home. [laughs] [music playing on record player] [shower running] Mom? Is that you? Who told you you could play my records? Congratulations. Thanks. For what? Your new assignment with the network. Nick Branca, a hero's look at the new. Your own spot on the network. So Are you my welcoming committee? You might say that. Could've done flowers. [music playing] ROSE: Nicky. Hi, ma. Got you a tree. ROSE: The last time you got me a tree was the back of your bike. You wanted a car. What do you want this time? It's a small favor, ma. It's-- You want another car? Ma, I got three cars. I don't need another car. Well, what do you want then? You know that girl who teaches blind kids? Yeah. I want to go out with her. Well, why look at me? Why don't you ask her? Well, you said yourself. I only know how to talk to models and actresses, and I figured you-- ma, you got me into this, you know. This is-- Hey, now, wait a minute. What do I look like, dial a date? Do you really like this girl? Yes, I do. You know, since you moved away, Angelina's been like a daughter to me. I really worry about her. And I don't want to start anything unless you're serious. You know, you really got to start making some decisions in your life. Now, if you're not serious, I'm not going to call her. I understand, ma. Make the call. And what happens if she says yes? I'll take her out. Where? I don't know. I'll take her-- I'll take her to the beach, camping. No way. Camping is like a motel room on wheels. You'll take her to that Chinese restaurant that your father took me the first time we went out. OK, I'll take her to the Chinese restaurant. And you promise not to get her drunk and take advantage of her? Why would I do that? You promise? I promise. OK. I'll make the call. Ma, thank you. [laughing] NICK: All right. Pick a card. Any card. Pick one. You pick one too. Come on. Just pick one. [inaudible] Don't show it to her. [girls laugh] Put the card in. Anytime you want to, put the card right there. Now, put it in there. OK. You're never gonna figure this out. OK. I'm gonna give it a magic twist and put it my pocket. Whose card is that? Mine. Whose card is that? Mine And whose deck is this? - Yours. - That's right. [girls laugh] All right. Give me the cards. You know any card tricks? GRANDMOTHER: Huh? Do you know any card tricks? Eh, carriage? - Card tricks, do you know any? - No. No? Well, here. Make one up. You play with the girls and I'm going to sit over here and relax. Excuse me. I'm gonna sit right down here. [sighs] Hi. Hi. How about you? You know any card tricks? You know any jokes? GRANDMOTHER: [singing in spanish] [girls laugh] [music playing] You like it, kid? Oh, yeah, I like it. What the hell are we doing here? Smell it, kid. [sniffs] [laughs] Smells green in here, doesn't it? [laughs] I can smell George Washington. [sniffs] Millions of George Washingtons in here. [laughs] 30 years, I've waited. We've made it to the show kid, the majors. Hell, I know what I'm talking about. I'm going to make you a millionaire. A million dollar reporter. You're going to do all this for me? Well, I'd be lying if I said I was just doing it for you. But it's not just the money. What about all those fringe benefits? HARRY: Nick Branca, it's a pleasure to finally meet you. You remember Liz Brown, don't you? Uh, no. I'm Sorry. We met after your heroics a few weeks ago. Don't you remember? A lot has happened since then. You understand. Of course. Well, you know each other now, and we hope to have a very long relationship. Liz and I have come up with your first feature report. We think it's a great way to get started. Harry, me and Nick were just talking before you came in about how excited he was to get started. Right, Nick? Oh. Yeah. I'm excited. Good. Liz? OK, our first segment is for high visibility. The governor heard about it and requested Nick for sole coverage of the groundbreaking of the new government offices. We'll be the only network there. How did they hear about us so soon? I told them. Good job. Nick, my door is always open. Oh, thank you. Mm-hmm. Nick. And thank you. SAM: The hell was that all about? Buddy just sold my soul to the majors. SAM: What do you mean? What I mean is starting tomorrow, we got exclusive coverage for the networks of the governor's fundraiser. [laughs] You gotta be kidding. Why would he waste us on some stupid black tie affair? Money, Sam. Lots of money. I can see the greed in his eyes. I think if he was in his mother's will for a dollar he'd kick her down a flight of stairs. You know, between you and me, a couple more bucks in the bank, and I'm out of this. Well, that old story sounded kind of serious. Why so sure? Love, Sam. Who? That poor Liz Brown? No. That angel, Angelina Matuse. Tell you she teaches blind kids? What? Only about five times. [laughs] Shut up. [crowd chatting] GOVERNOR: What are we doing here in the rain, anyway? The groundbreaking for the new capital building. Here's the speech, Sir. What's at two o'clock? We have the fund raiser for the homeless of this city. GOVERNOR: Why don't they just get jobs and work for a few dollars, and they can get a place to live? AIDE: That's the holiday spirit, Sir. I mean, them people have been forced out of their homes. I mean, some of them do work, but they can't make enough money to own their own dwelling. I mean, you know, some of them live in the street on boxes. With the winter months coming, their lives could be in serious jeopardy. Well, what are we going to do? Give them more money for to buy a bigger box. Whatever the people want, just make sure I get reelected. So how does it feel to be the only news crew in town invited by the governor himself to his own groundbreaking ceremony? Well, like Buddy says, it can only happen to a hero. I'm just happy you're here to remind me, Sam. Kiss my ass, hero. I wouldn't know where to start. Ah, come on. Let's go to work. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please? First of all, I'd like to thank you all for being here today and let you know the governor has arrived. [applause] Governor Nelson T. Jennings. [applause] I don't know if this is significant, but just as I arrived, the sun came out. [laughs] My friends, once again, welcome. I'm reminded of a story that my grandfather used to tell me when I was a little boy growing up in this state. Now, this is when the freeways were the farms that we planted. [laughs] Well, he kept a candle in my room. He lit the candle every night to read to me. He said, if the light of the candle goes out and leaves you in the dark, keep your eyes open because even in the dark, as long as you're not alone, you can see. But you, my friends, helped me see when I'm in the dark. [helicopter flying] You-- you help keep a light burning inside. A light of hope. A light of understanding. And a light of a new day. [applause] HELICOPTER APPROACHING] [inaudible] Let's go. [gunshots] [gunshots continue] [explosion] [crowd screaming] Sally, come in, please. BUDDY: You want a drink? Help yourself. Yes, Miss Brown? Sally, tell Marty to wait for me in edit bay one. And when Nick gets here, we'll cut the tape for tonight's programming. Anything else? Yeah. write a closing. Something interesting. That's it. Where the hell is he? He was supposed to be here by now. He'll be here. He just phoned. I know he'll be here. NICK: Hey. Here he is. [laughs] Thanks, Hero. Nicky, Nicky, I was dying here. I thought you weren't going to get here on time. Why the hell didn't you call me? Buddy, I just got shot at. Well, you're all right, aren't you? Of course you're all right. You want a drink? [laughs] I'll get you a drink. Nicky, my friend, you are going to see a check with more zeros on it than you have ever seen in your life. [laughs] That's it. I'm out. Oh, what the hell are you talking about? This is just the beginning. Well, maybe it is the beginning for you, Buddy, but it's over for me. That's take was your going away present. No charge. I'm going to go away somewhere and have two point five kids. You can't. I have an obligation. Hey, you said the magic word. "I". How can you sit here, sipping bourbon, while I'm out there getting shot at? All you care about is the fucking check. Well, the banks are closed on Sundays, Buddy. They're closed. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right, Nick. You're right. You know, I'm going to make sure that you get assignments that are less dangerous. But you see, Nick, I need your name. The network wants you, not me. You're the hero. What are you talking about, less dangerous? How less dangerous does a do-nothing governor groundbreaking get? What happened? I'm going to take care of you, kid. I made you a hero, so I'll protect you. We're guaranteed ratings, Nick. I make the news exciting, and you report it. Nick, come on, dammit We've made it to the game now. We tasted it. Come on, Nick. I can't help you, OK? I'm sorry. Don't you walk out on me. SALLY: Is everything all right, Mr. Arnstien? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Everything's fine. Fine. [ominous music playing] [tape rewinding] Holy shit. Let me see that again. [tape rewinding] Shit. God, they're going to love this. OK. Make sure you get the governor in there at least a couple of times. Get the helicopter. Get the explosion. Get all. Run it over to control. I want to get it on the air within the hour. Where's Nick? We lost him. What do you mean, you lost him? Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Without Nick, you can kiss your contract goodbye. We signed for two years. You'll have him for two years. I'm not so sure about that. He has a mind of his own. Personally, I don't think he's going to play the game. And I don't like that. One night in bed with the guy and you think you know what makes him tick? I know what makes the news. The phones are lit up like a Christmas tree. The response to the hero's look at the news is going to put us at the top. Now, I'm not going to jeopardize that because Nick Branca's having a bad day. Don't lecture me, sweetheart. I was hustling the streets of Reno with a beautiful broad on each arm while you were still kicking your mother's stomach. I can handle Nick Branca. I've handled tougher and smarter. It's not going to be that easy. Easy? [laughs] Easy? Easy as looking into someone's heart. And if you don't like what you see in there, you reach in with your hands, you rip it out, and you throw it in the garbage. I'll deliver Nick Branca. Just stay out of my way. [ominous music playing] Let me see that again. [phone ringing] [answering machine answers] Hi, you've reached Nick Branca's number. Leave your name, number, and time, if possible, after the beep, and I'll return your call. [beep] ROBERT (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Nick, this is Robert down at the network. Where are you? Buddy's having a shit fit. Says you won't return any of his messages. Please, Nick. Call us. [tires screech] [music playing] AGNELINA: Excuse me, can I help you with something? Oh, hi. I'm Buddy Arnstein. Friend of Nick's. You must be Angelina, right? Yes. [laughs] Pleased to meet you. Thank you. You know, Nick works for me. Ah, he used to work for me, anyway. Nick around? No, he's not. But he should be here any minute. Ah. A nice place you got here. Thank you. You know how he got this place? First big assignment that I ever gave him. He put 10 grand down right on this place. [laughs] And you know what he got for a second assignment? He was so good that I bought him a big midnight blue Lincoln that he keeps in his garage. [laughs] And then he bought himself a Porsche, and-- see, Nick made an awful lot of money because of me. And now, because of you, he's throwing it all away, Why don't we both help him out? Can't say as I blame him, pretty girl like you. I need him back at work. Think about it. I'll get him the message. That a girl. [music playing] You know, every time I see that movie, I cry. I like the part when the tree lights up and the puppy jumps out of the box. You wold like that part. You like dogs? I don't know. I never had one. Do you? No, I like birds. Birds? [laughs] birds. Yes, I like birds. Birds are-- [music playing] Feathers are so soft and so beautiful. So many colors. When they open their mouth to sing, it's God's music that comes out. And that's all it is. They fly so high. So high in the air. So free. I just-- so free. They remind me of you. God, Nicky. I love you. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to serve you dinner in bed. Oh, [laughs] All right, so why don't you go and wait for me, and I'm gonna whip something up. - OK. - OK? - Sounds Good. - All right. [sings to himself] [sighs] [laughs] [glass breaks] [screaming] DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): Respond to multiple stabbing homicide at 1328 Maple Drive, Hollywood. Victim, female, Caucasian. Black-- [inaudible] Did you find any fingerprints? Mm, lots of them. Whose are they? Yours. I'm a suspect? I'm afraid so, Nick. [whispering] [music playing] [screaming] Take that with you. I know who did it. Who? Buddy Arnstien. Do you have any proof? I found that in her hand. A cuff link? They make hundreds of thousands of these a year. Yeah, well, that's his. Why didn't you tell me this when we picked up the body? I'm telling you now. Now, are you going to help me or not? Nick, I can't get a search warrant on what you're telling me. I-- I'll-- I'll see what I can do, OK? Sure you will. Oh, and, uh, NIck, I wouldn't leave town if I were you. [doorbell rings] Nicky, what are you doing here? - You OK? - Yeah. What's the matter? Nothing. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Come on in. Come on in now. Oh, [inaudible] All right. I gotta to go. All right? What's the matter? I went by the coffee shop, and Sam told me you were working out of here now. I still go back and forth. You all right, kid? Never better. [liquor pouring] I guess you know why I'm here. No. Well, I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. You were right. I do belong in the street. It's in my blood. Everyone's been waiting for you. Contract's still got your name on them. Ain't even dusty. [scoffs] Yeah, well, the hell with the contracts. I just can't wait to get back out there and nail my first story. Everyone at the network is going to go nuts to hear you're back. If you want, I think I can even get them to renegotiate. You know, play hard to get. Squeeze a few more GWs out of them, yeah? No, let's nail a big story first. And then we'll move in for the kill, right? Right. You know, I can't stop thinking about when we met. When we first met, your father had just died, and you were some crazy kid. Yeah, but you gave me a job. You put money in my pocket. I didn't give you anything. You worked for it. No big deal. It was a big deal to me. Gave me a new life. Ah, come on. I'll always remember how we used to sit, and you'd listen to me talk about cars for a thousand hours. [laughs] You must've talked about that Continental for almost a week. I figured the only way to get you to stop talking about it was to buy you one. [laughs] And then you drove it home, and you put it in the garage, and it's got, what, 20 miles on there? 22. 22. That car is classic. That car is very important to me. Car symbolizes what you mean to me. Ever since my father died, I've always had you to count on. That's what friends are for. You what I'll always remember is the sound of the Continental keys hitting the counter. How you just strolled in, walked over, reached into your pocket, and drop the keys right in front of me. [keys clank] What's that? This is 22 miles. This is the Continental, as new as the day you gave it to me. And now, it's my gift to you. Oh, you can't. Oh, yes, I can. And I will. Now, I've never refused anything from you. Now, don't insult me. [laughs] You know? This is funny. The day I bought the car, I was driving it home from the dealers, you know, over the bridge, and, uh, I almost kept it for myself. [laughs] Isn't that funny? [scoffs] Well, that just goes to show you. What comes around goes around. Here is to a new beginning. A new life [together] A new beginning. And a new beginning. [music playing] Yeah, Buddy. It's Nick. Listen, I got the greatest story ever, but I'm gonna need your help. Yeah, meet me at the fourth street bridge. Look, don't ask any questions, Buddy. It's worth a lot of GWs, so just be there. I'll be right there. Buddy, you're late. Oh, you should not have turned that car on, Buddy, because that classic piece of gift machinery will never start again. You're probably wondering why I called you here this lovely evening. Am I right? Well, to tell you know the truth, I called you here to give you the greatest story you or I have ever seen. Oh, It's not here on tape yet. But it will be, OK? So you get nice and comfy. Can you hear me, Buddy? If you can hear me, smile. Buddy, you're not smiling. That's OK, Buddy. I can hear you. I can hear every breath you take. All right, what the hell is going on here? What kind of game is this? A game? Why, it's truth or consequences, and I'm your MC, Nick Branca. I got nothing to say. Why don't you pack up your toys like a good boy and go home before someone gets hurt [buzzer sound] Wrong answer. I guess that means you gotta die tonight. Are you crazy? I don't scare easy. What the hell is going on here? I didn't do anything. Buddy, I just have one question for you. Was it really worth all that money? Did she have to die? I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Your mistake was not killing me. You're crazy. Let me out this car, god dammit. I didn't do anything. You gotta believe me. NICK (ON CAR STEREO): Check the glove compartment, Buddy. Open it. Look familiar? Bye, Buddy. I did it for you. For both of us. It was business. No. This is business. Get-- get me out of-- [explosion] DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): [inaudible] San Fernando train tracks. Amtrak derailed after [inaudible] fire in progress. Multiple [inaudible] [radio goes off] NICK: Now, the story that you've just seen is what sells. Anything less is not acceptable and is subject to possible suspension or termination. Do you have any questions? JOHNNY: No. No. NICK: What's your name? Johnny. NICK: Johnny. You don't look so good, Johnny. You going to be all right? Just a little nervous. I'd be a fool to say I wasn't, being this is my first night. That's a good answer. The cocky ones scare me. They're the ones that think they know too much. They're also the ones that aren't around too long. Stick with me, kid. I'll make you a hero. What's your name? Chuck. You don't look so good, Chuck. I'm going to be just fine. You get the South Central LA. Move it. [music playing] (SINGING) In the streets, where life is so hard, the warrior faces, sometimes, oh sometimes, sometimes a dividing call. A dividing call. Warrior. What to bring to us all. Midnight warrior. He may lose to a higher cause, the rating, where he unfolds, in his stories, his soul. Oh, his soul. Show no mercy. Show no mercy.
