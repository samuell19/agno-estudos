BUT, UH, IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T THINK TOO MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE AS UNDERSTANDING AS I HAVE BEEN. - WHO ELSE? I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU TOOK CARE OF THINGS. - I DID, I DID, BUT IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, I INCURRED SOME EXPENSES. - (chuckles) AND WHAT EXACTLY IS THE AMOUNT OF THESE EXPENSES? - THAT IS THE QUESTION. THE AMOUNT. NOW, I KNOW I ONLY WORKED FOR ONE NIGHT, BUT THE VALUE OF THE WORK, EDDIE, THE VALUE, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. - NO, I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BLACKMAIL. - (chuckles) YOU WATCH TOO MUCH TV, EDDIE, TOO MUCH TV. I'M NOT BLACKMAILING YOU. I MERELY PERFORMED A SERVICE FOR YOU. A SERVICE THAT'LL ENABLE YOU TO, UH, KEEP YOUR CUSHY JOB AND ALL ITS UNDER-THE-TABLE PAYOFFS. KEEP YOUR NAME OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS AND, UH, STOP YOU FROM BEING PUBLICLY HUMILIATED. - HOW MUCH? HOW MUCH? HOW MUCH? - I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'M NOT TOO GOOD AT, UH, TALKING ABOUT FIGURES. WHY DON'T WE EACH WRITE DOWN AN AMOUNT AND SEE WHAT WE COME UP WITH, HUH? THANK YOU. (laughs) YOU MUST BE A LOT OF LAUGHS AT PARTIES, HUH, EDDIE? A LOT OF LAUGHS.

THAT'S THE LIMIT. - THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FRIENDLY FUCKING GAME. - THE MAN'S GETTING TOUCHY. A MAN GETS TOUCHY, IT MEANS HE'S UNSURE. - NOW HE'S A FUCKING FORTUNE COOKIE. - ARE YOU IN OR OUT? - HERE'S MY 20 FUCKING BUCKS. (phone rings) - HERE ARE YOUR THREE TENS. - THREE QUEENS. - TWO FIVES. - FUCK YOU. - "FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU." WHAT ARE YOU, IN HEAT? - YES? YES, HE IS. ONE MOMENT PLEASE.

NO, SHE WAS REALLY SPECIAL, NICK. - THEY ALWAYS ARE, AREN'T THEY, EDWARD? - NO, THIS ONE WAS SO SPECIAL, SHE OD's ON COCAINE BEFORE I GET A CHANCE TO BANG HER. - DEAD? - DEAD! WAIT, IT GETS BETTER. SHE'S GOT A ROOMMATE WHO SEES ME LEAVING THE MOTEL, AND NOW THIS LITTLE WEASEL THINKS IT MIGHT BE WORTH SOMETHING TO HIM. - WELL, HE MIGHT HE RIGHT. - THAT ISN'T WHAT I WANT TO HEAR, NICK. - YOU KNOW, THERE'S THIS GREAT JUKEBOX AT THE BAR THAT I JUST CAME FROM, RIGHT? IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A REQUEST... - LOOK, EDWARD, BLACKMAILERS ARE LIKE CHRISTMAS. THEY KEEP COMING AROUND. AND EVERY TIME THEY COME AROUND, IT COSTS A LITTLE MORE TO MAKE THEM GO AWAY. - AH, NICK, NICK, NICK. I'M JUST NOT USED TO BEING SQUEEZED. - IT TAKES GETTING USED TO, DOESN'T IT, EDWARD? - WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? - WELL, WHAT'S HE WANT? - HE WANTS A MILLION DOLLARS. - A MILLION DOLLARS? - AND HE WANTS ME TO WAIT BY THE PHONE FOR HIS INSTRUCTIONS. - NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'LL GO IN YOUR PLACE WITHOUT THE MONEY. - WHY? - GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE TIME, GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A TAKE ON THE GUY, MAYBE CONVINCE HIM THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO PURSUE THE MATTER ANY FURTHER. - BUT WHAT IF YOU SPOOK HIM, NICK? - FOR A MILLION DOLLARS, MOST PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO GIVE YOU A SECOND CHANCE, AREN'T THEY? - I DON'T KNOW. YOU HUNGRY? - NO, NO. - NO? - DOMINICK, TAKE US OVER TO THE MIRAGE, WILL YOU? COME ON, I'LL BUY YOU A STEAK. YOU LOOK TOO SKINNY.

(door squeaks) - YEAH? - I REPRESENT EDWARD MINTON. - YEAH? - YEAH. I THINK WE SHOULD TALK. - COME ON. COME, COME, COME, COME. SO, YOU GOT THE MONEY OR WHAT? - I'D IMAGINE MY ANSWER FALLS UNDER THE OR WHAT CATEGORY. - LOOK, PAL, I NEED THAT MONEY AND I NEED IT NOW. - EXACTLY. AND BECAUSE YOU NEED IT, YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A WHOLE LOT LESS. - YEAH? LIKE HOW MUCH LESS? I'M OFFERING YOU $100,000. - (laughs) - I'M TALKING CASH IN YOUR POCKET TOMORROW MORNING. NO TAXES, NO STRINGS. THAT'S A LOT OF FREE MONEY, JIMMY BOY. - YEAH, WELL, HE CAN GET A LOT MORE. - MAYBE HE CAN, MAYBE HE CAN'T. THE QUESTION IS, CAN YOU? - TOMORROW MORNING? - AS SOON AS THE BANK OPENS. - OKAY, HOW ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION? - HOW ABOUT I SAY GOOD NIGHT? - LOOK, MAN, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE FORGETTING THAT I HOLD ALL THE CARDS HERE. - WELL, THEN YOU BETTER CHECK YOUR HAND, JIMMY BOY, BECAUSE IF MINTON DECIDES TO PLAY THIS TOUGH, YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH ZIP. - (groans) OKAY. WHAT'S THE ABSOLUTE MOST I COULD GET? - ABSOLUTE MOST, $100,000. - LOOK, MAN, YOU'RE NOT NEGOTIATING HERE WITH ME, YOU'RE OFFERING ME AN ULTIMATUM. - THAT'S RIGHT. AND HERE'S THE OTHER THING, HOW DO WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER WALK DOWN THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD? - I GIVE YOU MY WORD, OKAY? - DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE FUCKING WITH, HUH? DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE FUCKING WITH? - LOOK, I DON'T SCARE EASILY, ALL RIGHT? AND YOU JUST TELL HIM JUST IN CASE ANYTHING DOES HAPPEN TO ME, THAT I GAVE A FRIEND AN ENVELOPE WITH ALL THE DETAILS. - GLADLY. WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE? - OKAY. TOMORROW MORNING I GET THE CASH, NO TRICKS... AND I'M OUT OF HERE, OKAY? - YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN. (gunshot) - (grunts) (music) (tires squeal) (gunshots) - (gasps) WHO ARE YOU? - I'M A FRIEND, DON'T WORRY. WHAT IS THIS, PAISLEY? I HEARD IT WAS MAKING A COMEBACK. - WHERE'S JIMMY? - UH, WELL, JIMMY... HE STEPPED OUT. - I HEARD GUNSHOTS. - WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, UM, HE TRIED TO CATCH A BULLET WITH HIS CHEST. - OH, MY GOD. - YEAH. - THE POLICE! THE POLICE WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE. - I IMAGINE SO. - THERE'S A DUNKIN' DONUT SHOP RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. - I'M A MARRIED WOMAN! THEY CAN'T FIND ME LIKE THIS! - YOU'RE A MARRIED WOMAN? WELL, LADY, I SUGGEST THAT YOU GET HOME TO YOUR HUSBAND AND DO THE POTS AND PANS, COME ON. (police siren) (music) - (laughing) NICK, I'M TELLING YOU, I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH JIMMY'S MURDER. YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME. - DAMN IT, EDWARD, I GOTTA KNOW THE TRUTH. - I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH. I SWEAR TO GOD. WOULD I LIE TO YOU? - YES. - (laughs) I CAN'T COMPLAIN, THOUGH, BECAUSE NOW THAT THE BLACKMAILER'S DEAD, I'M OFF THE HOOK, RIGHT? (laughs) YEAH! - MAYBE. I MEAN, THE GUY SAID HE LEFT AN ENVELOPE WITH SOMEBODY. - NICK, THEY ALL SAY THAT. - SOMETIMES THEY DO, EDWARD. - WELL, WHERE DO WE STAND NOW? - WE WAIT. WE GIVE IT A WEEK OR TWO, IF YOU DON'T HEAR ANYTHING, THEN MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. MAYBE YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR. - GOOD. SALUD. - THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. - WHAT? - THIS. - OH, THE GIRL. - MM-HMM. - NICK, I'D LIKE YOU TO STAY ON THIS FOR A LITTLE WHILE. THE WHOLE THING IS REALLY STRANGE. YOU KNOW, FIRST THE GIRL OD's ON COCAINE, THEN THE BLACKMAILER WINDS UP GETTING MURDERED. WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS SOMEBODY'S GOING TO PINCH HIT FOR LITTLE JIMMY, AND I'M LIABLE TO GET BLINDSIDED. - THAT'S NO PROBLEM. - DON'T DO THAT. - DO YOU WANT A DRINK? - I'D LIKE A BEER. - A BEER? - A BEER. - YOU KNOW WHAT I REGRET MOST ABOUT THE WHOLE THING IN THIS CRAZY THING? - NO, WHAT'S THAT? - THE ONE REGRET I HAVE, IS THAT I NEVER REALLY GOT A CHANCE TO FUCK HER. - I'M SURE HER FAMILY APPRECIATES YOUR SENTIMENTS, EDWARD. - (laughs) (music) (machine beeps) - YEAH, LIEUTENANT HOWARD, PLEASE. NO, THAT'S FINE, I'LL WAIT. - EXCUSE ME, COULD I GET ANOTHER WHISKEY NEAT AND WATER BACK? - YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. - THANK YOU. FRANK, NICK. HOW YOU DOING? GOOD, GOOD.

YOU HAVE TO STAND AT A PRETTY SPECIAL ANGLE TO GET A JUDGE TO BUY THAT. - WELL, I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. - THE TRUTH? - YEAH. LAST WEEK, JIMMY CONTACTED ME. HE SAID IF I DIDN'T GIVE HIM $50,000 HE WAS GOING TO... - WHAT? - HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO SHOW MY HUSBAND SOME PHOTOGRAPHS. - SO I TAKE IT THESE PHOTOGRAPHS DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH A VISIT TO THE GRAND CANYON, RIGHT? - NO. I DID SOME PRETTY CRAZY THINGS WHEN I WAS WITH JIMMY. HE WAS INTO SOME KINKY STUFF. UNFORTUNATELY, HE DOCUMENTED A LOT OF IT ON FILM. I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT TYPE OF MONEY. MY HUSBAND KEEPS A PRETTY TIGHT REIN ON MY EXPENDITURES. YOU DON'T KNOW MY HUSBAND. - LADY, I DON'T KNOW YOU. - YOU SEE, MY HUSBAND, HE'S A GREAT DEAL OLDER THAN I AM, AND HE JUST-- HE WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND. - AND WHAT ABOUT THE PICTURES? - I GOT THEM BACK FROM JIMMY AFTER MINTON LEFT, ALONG WITH THE NEGATIVES. I JUST FEEL AWFUL ABOUT ALL OF THIS. - WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK EDWARD MINTON FEELS? - IF I EVER SEE JIMMY AGAIN, IT'D BE TOO SOON. - WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT, HE'S DEAD. - HE'S DEAD? - OH, YEAH. - HE WAS MURDERED LAST NIGHT. - BY WHO? - I DON'T KNOW. I WAS HOPING MAYBE YOU COULD POINT ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. - WHAT ARE YOU, A COP? - NOT ANYMORE. LET'S JUST SAY I'M WORKING FOR AN INTERESTED PARTY. - OH, SO YOU WORK FOR MINTON? - MAYBE. - SO HE KNOWS I'M ALIVE. - NOT YET. - 555-6793. - AND WHAT'S THAT? - IN CASE YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE IT, IT'S MY PHONE NUMBER. CALL ME. - BINGO! (chuckles) - JESUS, YOU'RE IN A HELL OF A MOOD. - WHY NOT? NOBODY'S TRIED TO BLACKMAIL ME ALL DAY. - THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WON'T. IT'S STILL EARLY. - I THINK I COVERED MY BASES PRETTY GOOD, NICK. - YOU THINK SO? - DOMINICK, THE BALL IN THE WATER, GET IT. - SO HOW LONG YOU WANT ME TO PLAY OUT THIS STRING? - A LITTLE WHILE, NICKY. I'D RATHER PAY YOU THAN PAY A BLACKMAILER. - I DON'T BLAME YOU. IT'S A LOT CHEAPER. - (chuckles) - ANYTHING ABOUT THAT GIRL, NICK? - NO, NO, NOTHING. - WHEN YOU LEAVE, THERE'S A ENVELOPE ON THE TABLE WITH A LITTLE BONUS IN THERE FOR YOU. - FOR WHAT? - I LIKE TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE CARE OF ME. - YOU ALSO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T. - DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ, NICKY. - NEVER. - DOMINICK, GET IN THE WATER, NOW!

GOD, I LOVE THAT KID. - AHH! - SO, WHAT'S ALL THE INTEREST IN JIMMY FARGO? - HE'S JUST A FRIEND OF A FRIEND, THAT'S ALL. - YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING BAD COMPANY SINCE YOU QUIT BEING A COP. - SOME HABITS ARE HARD TO BREAK, FRANK. SO JIMMY'S THE BAD GUY, HUH? - NOT AS BAD AS HE WANTED TO BE. STRICTLY MINOR LEAGUE. - I TALKED TO A GUY OVER AT METRO THAT KNEW HIM. - HOW WELL? - WELL ENOUGH TO LAUGH A LITTLE WHEN I TOLD HIM JIMMY WAS DEAD. - SOUNDS LIKE HE TOOK IT PRETTY HARD. - THE GUY SAID JIMMY WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO COME ACROSS AS A BIG-TIME DEALER, MOSTLY TO DAZZLE THE DOLLS. BUT HE WAS ALWAYS THE MIDDLEMAN, AT BEST. - YOU GOT ANY IDEA WHO TUCKED HIM IN FOR THE BIG SLEEP? - IT'S HARD TO SAY. JIMMY LOVED TO PLAY, BUT HE HATED TO PAY. - DANGEROUS COMBINATION, HUH, FRANK? - ESPECIALLY IN THE DRUG BUSINESS. WALK AWAY FROM THIS ONE, NICK. - YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DON'T, FRANK? - NO, IT'S JUST MY GUT TALKING. - NO, I THINK IT'S THE HORSERADISH. - THINK ABOUT IT. - FRANK, I'M NOT IN THAT DEEP, ALL RIGHT? NOW, I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, APPRECIATE THE CONCERN, BUT WHAT I REALLY NEED HERE IS A GODDAMN LEAD. - THERE'S THIS GUY MITCH. JIMMY OWED HIM PLENTY. - HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM? - YEAH. HE KNEW THE DRILL. - HOW CAN I GET A HOLD OF HIM? COME ON, FRANK, IT'S ME. - SHOOTS STICK AT A LITTLE PLACE ON SAHARA CALLED SHIFTY'S. - SHIFTY'S. I APPRECIATE THIS, FRANK, I DO. - NICK, MY GUT'S NEVER BEEN WRONG BEFORE. - FRANK, YOUR GUT'S NEVER BEEN THAT FAT BEFORE. YOU WANT ANOTHER DOG? I'M BUYING. - SO, IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME? - UH-HUH. - YOU SCARED? - A LITTLE BIT. - DON'T WORRY, SHE'S NOT GOING TO BITE YOU. JUST LOOSEN UP ON THE REINS. - OKAY. - EASY, EASY. - YOU ALL RIGHT? - UH-HUH. - GOOD. EASY, WHISKEY, EASY. - (clicks tongue) - I'M GLAD YOU CALLED. - I FIGURE THAT'S WHY YOU GAVE ME YOUR NUMBER. - YOU KNOW, I COULD LIKE SOMEONE LIKE YOU. - I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU, I ALREADY LIKE YOU. MY HORSE LIKES YOU. - (laughs) JESUS, 20 MILES FROM VEGAS, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL HERE. - YEAH. I WOULDN'T LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE. - I FEEL SAFE. - FROM WHAT? - (scoffs) ARE YOU SURE YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW? - LADY, I HAVEN'T BEEN SURE OF ANYTHING SINCE THE BALTIMORE COLTS LOST THE SUPER BOWL WITH JOE NAMATH. - (laughs) - SO, YOU LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC? - SURE. ♪ GIVE ME A HOME WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM ♪ ♪ AND I'LL SHOW YOU A DIRTY HOUSE ♪ - THAT'S NOT MUSIC. - SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND. - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? - WHAT'S HE LIKE? - JEALOUS. - I'LL BET HE IS. GOT GOOD REASON TO BE. - I WANT YOU TO KNOW, IN MY THREE YEARS OF MARRIAGE, I'VE NEVER BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO MY HUSBAND. - I BELIEVE YOU. - YOU SEE, MY HUSBAND, HE'S A LOT OLDER THAN I AM. I KNEW WHAT I WAS GETTING INTO, AT LEAST I THOUGHT I DID, BUT I DON'T KNOW, HE CHANGED AFTER WE WERE MARRIED. I SAW A SIDE OF HIM THAT I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE. HE STARTED TO ABUSE ME, PHYSICALLY. HE, UH... - HE BEAT YOU? WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE A WALK? - HOW? - HOW? YOU PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER AND GET THE HELL AWAY FROM HIM. - OH, NO, IT'S TOO COMPLICATED. - LADY, YOU'RE TOO COMPLICATED. - ALL I KNOW IS I CAN'T GO BACK TO BEING POOR. I'VE BEEN THERE. NEVER AGAIN. - I DON'T KNOW, HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF COMMUNITY PROPERTY? - HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF A PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT? COME ON. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? OH, GOD, LOOK AT THIS, SHE RIDES, WHISKEY. THE LADY RIDES! HYAH! (music) - SHIT! - HI. LET ME HAVE A WHISKEY DEEP WITH A WATER BACK, PLEASE. - HERE YOU GO. - GRAZIE. - COME ON, PAY OR PLAY.
