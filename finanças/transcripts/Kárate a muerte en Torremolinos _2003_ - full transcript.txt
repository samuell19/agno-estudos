Good evening, dear teleTorremolinos viewers, welcome to another night with Dr. Orloff. I have here with me tonight two experts on the battle against evil. They're going to help shed some light on this mystery. Where do these dead people come from? Why did the girl disappear? What is behind all of this? And we have here the great sub-commander Bermuda. Hello, good evening. Good evening. And the great Matias pollo, the monster-hunting jailbird. Hello, good evening Are you here on a visit? I have come to warn you that Torremolinos is under great danger and it's coming from the sea. Now we are going to see some spectacular footage, some images that have turned the world upside down, images of death and desolation. Our town has been rocked over the last few hours by the appearance of various dead bodies, let us not forget that a girl has also mysteriously disappeared. Sects, vendettas, black masses, aliens and all in a town where tourism is the top industry, the less valiant have fled, while the rest who are carrying on with their daily lives are at risk, our town is a target of great evil. A chilling report you must agree. I would like to delve further into the problem. I understand there are evil forces at large. Since you are specialist on evil forces, could you tell us more about this? It's quite incredible, salads with salmonella, sunbathers with sunstroke, rabbits with myxomatosis, something is in the air. Mr. Matias pollo, you revealed a series of photos that turned the world upside down, some quite daring reports, then suddenly you disappeared for a number of years and now you're back here in Torremolinos to investigate, what happened exactly? Well, I was deep-sea diving, looking for marine and mythological life, when my oxygen tank broke... and I was sucked down to the seabed and put under inhuman pressures which fractured my backbone in seven places. Unbelievable, unbelievable Dear friends, we have also received a number of calls from teenagers, who are still a little green when it comes to sex, and as virgins they are asking us are they a potential target, and if so what measures should they take? Indeed, virgins are at a high risk and should therefore take refuge in their rooms and keep chaste, with padlocks around their legs. Load of bollocks, no, virgins should get some mass orgies going with their mates, a gang bang, let them screw fifty, a hundred, two hundred All you virgins will become women of the world. Does this have anything to do with the mystery we are witnessing? Well, the enemy Is called Jocantaro. - Get on with you! - Jocantaro! Jocantaro is a household name In Torremolinos, it is one of our most mysterious legends People from Torremolinos can't stop talking when it comes to Jocantaro. Jocantaro! If Jocantaro awakes what will it do? What will happen? Chaos, the end of the world As we know it. Well, friends, I'm afraid time has run out for today, until next week on Dr. Orloff's show. Good night and take care, Your daughters are not safe on the streets. THE SEARCH FOR YOUNG GIRLS CONTINUES Don't think I'm not attracted to you, but for now it's out of the question. Stop talking bollocks, I've had it with your fucking brotherhood. Hey listen, the Catholic Brother... Fuck the Catholic Brotherhood Of Surfers! We'd like to dedicate this song To our friend, "Flaco". who was found cut up in pieces and his missing girlfriend, "Super zombi"! Shit I don't believe it, "Flaco". I was surfing with him yesterday I love you Danuta. I love you too. Hey you, show us your pass. TeleTorremolinos regional news. Just one hour ago a mass murder was committed.

I was in there, four guys dressed in black burst in, they started smelling me up and down, it was terrible. I was having a spliff when four guys, I don't get it, I'd had a few and then there was like blood, blood everywhere. They started sniffing my girlfriend.

Once again the mayor is giving out no information, I said, what do the Police make of all this shit? Well, according to witnesses, we are dealing with a highly dangerous karate squad. No-one knows where they have come from. Some say they are cannibals, others say they are evil spirits. Have we got photos? - No, no but... - Any suspects? No, but may I point out. Tell me something. I don't know, Rosalie. - Portfolio... Portfolio. - OK Who is this idiot? Chuck Lee, six times world karate champion, ex-marine, reward seeker, mercenary, just the person we need to put an end to this situation. OK, OK. How much is it going to cost us?

You know Jess, you're the only one that treats me like a human being, and that's why I'm going to tell you about the legend of Jocantaro. Yeah that crazy story. Before men took Over the earth, there was a race of scary sea warriors, the same ones that put an end to the dinosaurs. Woohoo! Come on, pass it over, you're losing it. The most frightening of all these creatures Lived here, in these waters. I can still remember what my grandma used to tell me about the terrible monsters. In their satanic night parties they used to take hundreds as their victims. They called it the night of Jocantaro. And the three bears. Right, Manolo, I'm going to split. Five hearts. Well, well... - Five girls... Jocantaro! Jocantaro! Jocantaro! TeleTorremolinos, regional news.

Enemies of evil, you are the scum that craped Oscum, foolish, contemptible beings, you will be my servants, the hour has come, the hour for you to bow down to evil! Good bye, you contemptible beings. Right, what have we got? In my humble opinion Lord Mayor, this man is completely crazy. A sharp observation, don't you have any more important information? I have a newspaper cutting that may help us solve the crisis. Is that all we have? I don't know if it's the ultimate solution, but it's clear that this case is beyond human understanding. As the local crisis consultant, I suggest we call in an expert on the battle against evil. - What another karate kid? - No, a highly distinguished parapyschologist. We have problems with hotel cancellations, the casinos are empty, not to mention our reputation abroad. And than there's those girls, the poor things. I think we should call in this Dr. to straighten out the mess. Marisa, book me in for golf. Hello. Can I speak to Danuta? Thanks. Danuta, my love, how are things? Look, are you on about sex again? Calm down, you know what I and the brotherhood think about making love. Are you threatening me? I can be bad too you know. Listen, Danuta... Danuta!

I think I've discovered something, maybe it's just a hunch, but... last night I had a dream. Suddenly I heard a voice that said: "Come to Veronica, come to Veronica". Then some scissors came flying towards me, I was shitting myself! Then this morning, I found this on the bedside table. You wont believe it. We've got to call up Veronica's spirit. You want to practice black magic, call up evil spirits, not if front of me you're not you heathen. Listen, were talking supernatural, shit you're the one that saw the dead man on the beach.

There's some dodgey business going on. - We've got problems in Torremolinos. - What sort of problems? Girls disappearing. People dying. I think our brotherhood should tackle this problem face on. Jess, mate, I think you're right, there's something evil in all this. And our duty as Catholics is to try and prevent Evil from setting up his kingdom on earth. Brother Jess, this is a delicate matter. - I think we should consult the Bishops. - There's no time! You've got to trust me, we must wait for Miyagi to get here. This is the apostalate.

But what are you bastards doing? Leave the girls alone. You can have sex with them when they're dead. Come to me, god of darkness. Oh, Jocantaro, I offer you these girls as a sacrifice. Five teenage virgins buried you in the sea. Five teenage sluts will free you. Oh, Jocantaro, come out from the depths! Awake, Jocantaro! Your servant calls you forth! Start digging! Jocantaro, dig!

I am not your disciple, I've come to finish you off. Let's see who gets the last laugh. What have you done to her? Danuta is already dead. Son of a bitch! Danuta!
