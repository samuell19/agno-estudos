..:: YOLO - Your Source Of Quality::.. Pandora's forests hold many dangers. But the most dangerous thing about Pandora is… that you can come to like her too much. We sing the chords to remember. Each pearl is a story from our life. A gem for the birth of our son. Not finished! Not finished! A gem for our adopted daughter, Kiri, - - born of Grace's avatar, - - and whose conception was a complete mystery. A gem for the first meeting with Eywa. The people say we live in Eywa, - - and Eywa lives in us. The almother takes care of all her children. Happiness is straightforward. Think a toad like me would find it. The first time I met your father, I tried to kill him. Love at first sight. Before I knew it, we had four. We sent the sky people back to Earth, but some stayed here. Scientists who were loyal to the Na'vi. And then there was Spider. He was trapped here. Too young for a cryocapsule. The war had taken his parents, so he was raised by the scientists. He was like a stray cat that kept coming running. He and our kids were inseparable. To Neytiri he would always be a stranger. One of them. He belongs among his own. - I had it first! - Why do you have to have it? I was a few years away from having the language hammered into the tuber. But now it comes naturally to me. I hate you! I hate you to no end, Lo'ak! Crazy face! Whoa, that's good. Soon firewood falls down. He immediately emerges from the rocks. There he is. Like, take it. Neteyam, the great fisherman. Good boy. - It's a big crab. - By the stones, as you said. - How tall is he? - So tall. Time flies. Like a dream. - Kiri. - Come here, bro. Smile, skxawng. Happiness is straightforward. It can be a date night without children. There's just that about luck... that it can end abruptly. A new star in the night sky. That could only mean one thing. Ships slowing down. The Sky People had returned. A YEAR LATER The pulse rises. They'll probably make it. Take it easy. Good pupillary reaction. Remove it there. Colonel, can you hear me? Please lie down. - Stun him! - Hurry up! - Call the guards! - Grab him! Hold him! Calm down, Colonel! It's me, Corporal Wainfleet! Lyle? Is it you? Yes, and Z Dog. And Fig. Just let me go. I'm completely calm. It didn't matter. Attention. Two minutes to land on Pandora. The umbilical cord is gone. Oxygen uptake: 89. In case you were in any doubt, you are Colonel Miles Quaritch, - - just younger, taller, bluer and less pretty. In two hours I will attack the Na'vi fortress. It was thought advisable that I make this backup. And if you see it, it means I've put the clogs away. Parker, what the hell else can I say? Just remind him how it works. Your memories and your personality are sent back to Earth, - - where you are being cultivated. You will have them instilled… Is it me or you doing this? The idea is to transfer the psyche from the toughest extraterrestrial actors - - as Corporal Wainfleet there and signed - - til recombinant body. You are a recombinant souled with my memories and my charm. You won't be able to remember my death because it hasn't happened yet. And it won't come to that either. Whatever happened, you as a clone of me will thirst for revenge, - - primarily over Jake Sully. Remember that a Marine can never be defeated. You can kill us, but we'll regroup in hell. Semper fi. Land force, now! Day ago! Two minutes, guys. - We have to go down there, bro. - Father will kill us. Now don't be such a douchebag. Lo'ak, come back! The entire box must be included, both magazines and rocket guides. - Come on bro! - Lo'ak! Take it. Take a weapon, kid. Lo'ak, you don't even know how to use it. Dad showed me that. A helicopter gunship! Come on bro! Lo'ak, where are you? Netay! Are you unharmed? where is your brother - Over there. - Hurry away! Not finished! Oh no. Far? What the hell were you doing here? Pardon. Sorry, Dad. We're not in Kansas anymore. We're on our way to Pandora. I know you are all asking yourselves the same question: Is it blue monday? The sins of the past have made us reborn in the form of our enemies. We have their size, their strength, their speed. Added to our training, it's a powerful cocktail. - Have we got a mission? - We have that. Our mission is to find and kill the leader of the na'vi rebel army. Him they call "toruk makto". Jake Sully. Attack, attack! Got you! Come on now, Tuk. I'm clearly faster when I'm blue. And the animals show me more respect. - They don't see me as a person. - Wait, are you human? They are coming! THE FORTRESS OF THE OMATIKAYAS They come! Kiri! Spider! The warriors have returned! Came! Come along. - Mor! - Tuck, Tuck, Tuck. Step up. You are scouts. You must keep an eye out for enemies. At a distance! Does that sound familiar? Here I let you fly a mission and then you disobey. - Kiri, help with the wounded. - My brother is also injured. - Tuk, go with her. - Father, I take full responsibility. Yes, because you are the oldest and you must behave accordingly. - MaJake, your son is bleeding. - It doesn't matter, mother. Go in and get patched up. You must be aware that you almost had your brother killed. You are banned from flying for a month. Look at the Ukrainians. All of them. And wipe the nastiness off your face. - Should I breathe on it? - Give him this. - I would use yalnabark. - Aha. Who is tsahik here? You are, grandma, but yalnabark is better. - It hurts less. - Mighty warriors. What is it? Neteyam and Lo'ak try to live up to you. It's hard for them. I know. You are hard on them. I am their father. That's my job. We are not a platoon. We are a family. I thought we had lost him. - Hi there. - Hey, Spider. - I'll knock you out. - Just come. Only avatars are allowed here. Walk around. - The blue stripes don't make you bigger. - I can still spread you out. - What a day. - It was long. Very funny. It is so clean down there that you can breathe earth air for hours. I can only inhale yours for ten seconds. Yes, it's downright, monkey cat. For you. - Hey, Max. - Hey, kids. Hi Mom. Maybe I'm getting cocky, but I see real evidence - - on a systemic response at global level. I can not... I will not use the word "intelligence". "Awareness" is probably a better word. It's as if the entire biosphere on Pandora - - is conscious and able to respond cognitively. I can't say that. Then they crucify me. Who do you think did her roe? - It was guaranteed Norm. - Definitely. - You don't deserve to live. - Think about it. He is with her constantly. I wanted to commit suicide. I wanted to drink acid. He is in all recordings. Look at the look he gives her. I imagine their avatars together out in the woods… Ad! It's not always cool to know who your father was. Hole in it. I don't even remember him. No, Spider... Spider... You are not him. BRIDGEHEAD CITY Inside the terminal! No stay! Go! Masks off. Colonel, it's the general. General Ardmore. Nice to meet you, Colonel. I hear good things. But a lot has changed since you were here last. Came. The new command center here has just been commissioned. The crowd fitters can erect a building in six days. We have done more here in one year than in the previous 30 years. We are not here to run a mine. I have a far more important mission. The earth is dying. Our task is to tame the wilderness - - with the aim of making Pandora the new home of humanity. But before we can do that, we have to pacify the savages. Sully's whims have become bolder and more frequent. His attacks are well executed. There is good coordination between the troops. They go after mines and pipelines and sabotage our supply chain. They attacked a mag train two days ago. - Do we know anything about Sully's base? - Yes. Show me the mountains. There is a cave system in the Hallelujah Mountains. But every time we send troops up there, we suffer losses. It's like poking a wasp's nest. After ten minutes in their airspace they swarm around us. Colonel, we think your blue team will be mistaken for natives - - and not trigger an immune reaction. How do we test that hypothesis? The hard way. Wonderful. - We are approaching enemy airspace. - Received. - Come on, monkey! - Wait for me! - Tuk, come on. - Okay, okay. Why did you bring her? The honking princess. "I'm gossiping. You must not go out to the battlefield. I'll tell mother if you don't take me." Come on. - How crazy! - Is there a body? Hold that up. Kiri? Kiri. Kiri. Kiri... - Are you okay? - I did it again, didn't I? Yes, you did. Skin! - We have to see to come back. - Came. What is it? We must be home before dark. - Too big to be human. - Avatars? Maybe, but not any of ours. - What are you doing? - Following the tracks. Keep your back covered. Secured. Make a call. Holy shit. We shouldn't be here at all. Dad gives you a no-fly zone for the rest of your life. We have to look into it. Bro, that's where your father and my father fought. - It's your father's suit. - Holy shit... Lyle, check for data on the camera. - It's stone dead, Colonel. - We were too. - I have to report this. - We get so much trouble. - They will Dog, it's Eagle Eye. - Eagle Eye, come forward. I've spotted someone. They look like avatars, - - but they wear camouflage and assault rifles. There are six of them. What is your position? We are at the old cabin. Who are we"? Me, Spider, Kiri... and Tuk. Now you are listening very well. Retreat silently. - Hurry out of there. Understood? - Yes. We are on the way. Dad, I know a loophole. - You get into so much trouble. - Now stop, Kiri. It's eclipse right away. - Put it down or I'll shoot! - Come with me. - Drop it! - Right now! Put it, put it. Come here! Down on your knees! Stop bragging. - Visit them for weapons. - Kiri! Take it easy. Shut up! What do we have here? Look, Colonel. Four fingers. It's a half-breed. Show me your fingers. You're his, aren't you? Yes, you are his. Where is he? Unfortunately I don't speak English - - with assholes. Where is your father? Should it be with it on? Shut up! - Kiri! No, don't! - You don't touch her! You mustn't hurt her. - Stand still. - What's your name, kid? Spider Socorro. Miles? Nobody calls me that. It was hell. I assumed you had been sent back to Earth. Children cannot tolerate cryo, clap hat. What do we do, boss? Iron Sky, Blue 1 here. - Blue 1, come forward. - We are ready for collection. - Fly us in. - Dragonfly begins collection. We bring very valuable prisoners. - Blue 1, we're on our way. - Arrival in ten. We're counting down. Lyle, get me sound on this one. - It's Sully's wife. - She's a wild animal. Giv op, Quaritch. - Sully. - Stupid pig. It's not over as long as I'm breathing. I was hoping you would say that. - You stay with the Iranians. - But I'm a warrior like you. I won't say it again. Bleach. There is no more after that. Should we salvage the remains? Blue 1, we'll be there in three minutes. Three minutes. Cover our backs. Shut up! Then clap in! Skirmish in the rear! Lo'ak! You little shit! - Tuck, come on! - Race! Come along! In cover! Come now! Is that you, Mrs. Sully? I recognize your business card. Come forward freely, Mrs. Sully. The two of us have an unfinished business. Demon! I will kill you as many times as it takes. You and the corporal have been really diligent, haven't you? You have raised a litter of half-breeds. After' four! Run, run, run! Are you okay, kid? Follow me. Clear? Not! Come on! - Run, run, run! - After them! Spider? - Spider! - Kiri! Come here! Spider is down there! - Then we are ahead. We have ten minutes. - Blue 1, back to the collection point. - Blue 1, fall back. - Back! Back, back! Take off! Kiri, come on! Come on! Run, run, run! - Are you hurt? - No, I'm fine. Tuk, are you hurt? Then the danger is over. Is everyone unharmed? Tuk! We made it. Thank you, All courage is, thank you. Where is Spider? They took him. They took him. Take it easy, honey. He's a cool kid. He'll probably make it. We'll probably make it all together. Before hell! Let me out! He has become like a savage. He thinks he is one of them. The Quaritch creature can wade in here without Eywa spotting him. - Our home is here. - This applies to our children. You can't ask me for that. I cannot leave my people. I will not. He's chasing us. He's after our family. You can't ask me for that. The children only know the forest. Our home is here! He had our children. He had them under his knife. My father gave me the bow here when he was dying. He told me to protect the people. You are toruk makto! This will protect the people. Quaritch has Spider and he knows everything. He can lead them right here. If the people hide us, they will be killed. Do you understand that? I have nothing. I don't have any plan. But I can protect our family. One thing I know. Wherever we are, family is our fortress. - Where's Jake Sully? - I do not know! - We know, you know. - I do not know! Form a picture in your mind. Does it represent the floating mountains? - Release me! - He bristles against. Dan a thought, and we'll see. - I do not know! - I don't enjoy this either. - Which clans protect him? - I have no idea! The forehead patch goes absolutely crazy. It won't stop until you tell us where he is. I don't know, you assholes! Let me try the personal angle. He is not your son. Funny, Tarzan, funny. Are you calm? You're cool, kid. The researchers gave you the rough file, - - but you didn't reveal anything. I respect that. Maybe you want this. This is Colonel Miles Quaritch. Deceased. The decline in service. I'm not him. But I have his memories. And they tell me, - - that he wasn't the world's best father. But that is not an excuse. I'm not your father. Technically, the two of us are not related. But I can help you. I can get you out of here. I won't ask you to betray Jake Sully. You would never do that. You are loyal. And I admire loyalty. Now just take it. Otherwise I must leave you to the coattails. My heart is heavy as stone. Tarsem is young but wise. He will become a strong olo'eyktan. The leader must die... so that the leader can be born. Toruk makto will disappear. The people will be able to know for sure. A father protects. That is his purpose in life. One life ends. Another begins. Oh, Tuk... The sea clans inhabit a world of their own. Thousands of islands. An unknown area where we will be able to disappear without a trace. Aren't we there soon? AWA'ATLU, IN METKAYINA-LANDSBY Let it stay. Follow me. Tuk. Behave nicely. Behave nicely. Take it easy. What is it? Should it represent a tail? It is then too small to swim with. Hang on, Rotxo and Ao'nung. Hi. Tonowari was chief of the Metkayina, the reef people. - I see you, Tonowari. - Jake Sully. He was known as a harsh leader. But it wasn't Tonowari that worried me. I see you, Ron al, the tsahik of the metkayinas. I see you, Ron al. - What do you want from us, Jake Sully? - We are looking for a trip... - Uturu? - Asylum for my family. We are reef people. You are forest people. Your skills cannot be used here. So we want to get to know yours, right? Their arms are thin. Their tails are weak. You will be slow in the water. The kids aren't even true Na'vi. Yes, we are. There is demon blood in them! Se her. I was born of the sky people and now I am na'vi. You can adapt. We will adapt. My husband was toruk makto. He led the clans to victory over the Sky People. Do you call it a victory to hide among strangers? Eywa has apparently turned her back on you, you chosen one. You must bear with my mate. She has flown a long way and is exhausted. Toruk makto is a mighty war hero. All Na'vi know his story. But we Metkayina are not at war. We can't let you take the war here. I'm done with war, okay? I just want to protect my family. We have asked for an outing... - Will we be sent away? - It will be OK. Toruk makto and his family stay with us. Consider them our brothers and sisters. But they don't know the sea. Therefore, they will be like newborns taking their first breath. Teach them about our way of life so that they will not suffer the shame of being useless. - What do you say then? - Thanks. So. My son Ao'nung and daughter Tsireya will guide your children. - Why? - It has been decided. Come and see our village. This way. Come on now, Tuk. It's right up here. This is your new home. It's possible. That's cool, huh? - Sully is, step up. - There is a family meeting. - Down on your knees. - Kiri. What? I need you to behave in an exemplary manner. I mean it. Learn quickly, take your turn, and avoid making trouble. Understood? Bleach. I want to go home. Oh, Tuk... Tuk, this is our home now. We'll probably make it. - As long as we look after each other. - What is it that dad always says? Sully is a stickler. Yes, Sully is a stickler. Then say it with conviction. - Sully is a stickler. - Sully is a stickler. Come on! Swim with us. - What's wrong with them? - They are bad at diving. Stop. They just have to learn it. - Are you okay? - You swim far too fast. Just breathe. You are not good at diving. You are probably better at swinging in the trees. - Stop it. - We don't understand your sign language. - I'll probably teach you that. - Where has Kiri gone? - Where is she? - Have you seen her? Hop on board, find a seat, and don't get in the way. - Come on, hurry up! - Coolest. Stop halfway, Karl Smart. Listen. There is a transmitter built into the mask. If you run away, I'll catch you at zero point five - - and gives you an old-fashioned finish. Understood? - Understood? - Yes. - Clear? - All clear. Listen carefully. Jake Sully has gone underground. But we'll probably find him and his crazy madame. To be able to do that, we must be na'vi. Too full screw. We must eat like the Na'vi, ride like the Na'vi and think like the Na'vi. And first of all, we must speak Na'vi. Do you call that speaking na'vi? You sound like a three year old. Okay, klogeåge. You've just been promoted from our monkey mascot to our interpreter. It's an illusion. If you want to live here, you must be able to ride. Tie the ribbon carefully. Feel his breath. Feel his strength. Hold fast her. - Look at his legs. - Hold tight. Everything okay, wood goblin? This warwalker is difficult to master. Maybe you should start with an il... No, this one. Remember, when diving, it is important to take the right position. I can do it. Yes like that. Calm. I love her already. Breathe in… and exhale. Imagine breathing into a flame. You must say your heartbeat. Breathe in. Breathe all the way down here. And exhale slowly. Lo'ak, your heart beats fast. Try to concentrate. Breathe in… and exhale. Empty your mind. You are learning to breathe. Come on, losers! Let me. What is it? Na'vi children do this with their bare fists. - Did Sully do it the hard way? - What do you think? What do we do? This is going to be good. Forward. It's you and me, baby. Did I say you have to tie the beak together first? Ih, tak! Forward! Can you see them? Come on, we have to move on. Take off. Yes, because! That's right, Colonel! Whose turn is it then? The being of water has no beginning and no end. The sea is around you and in you. The sea is your home before your birth... and after your death. Our hearts beat in the lap of the world. Our breath burns in the shadows of the deep. The sea gives and the sea takes. Water ties everything together. Life and death. The dark and the light. - I got it! Tsireya! - You did it. They let us breathe underwater. What is she doing? - Have no idea. - She just stares at the sand. What did you say? Are you a form of deformity? Are you a deformity? No. Are you sure? You are not a real na'vi. Look at those hands. See. Skrid, fish face. - Another four-fingered deformity. - Look at his little baby tail. - Let us be! - He's not normal. Look at his tail. It is very cute. You heard her. Leave them alone. Big Brother... Step with you. Now. Sensible. And from now on, please respect my sister. Come on. Farewell! They are deformities, the whole family. - Lo'ak... - Calm down bro. Yes, my hand is weird. I am a deformity. But it can do something cool. First I tie it really tight. And then… It's called a stroke, weakling. You will never touch my sister again. Hold on! Stop it! That's too stupid! Off, my tail! My ear! Let it go! He rips my ear! - What had I asked you? - To avoid making trouble. - It was my fault. - You must not take out the rubbish for him. Ao'nung called Kiri a deformity. Say sorry to Ao'nung. He is the chief's son. I don't care how, as long as you make peace with him. - What did the others look like? - Worse. - Well. - Much worse. Go away. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. Why shouldn't I? Why can't I just be like everyone else? Skin... What is the tree runner doing here? Sorry, I hit you a whole bunch of times. Let's be friends. Join us on a hunt outside the reef. This is where the men hunt. - I must not. - I asked the wrong brother. Let's do it. Come on! Stay tuned, forest troll! THE WOODEN BREAD CUTTERS - You survived. - It was awesome! Come on, I know a good place. Cold on the fish. What a fool. Gutter? Yes! It's not funny! Yes! Holy shit. You are a tulkun. You saved my life. Thanks. So. I have no idea what you said. They have done you harm. I try to pull it out. Trust me. Friends? Yes, we are friends. Bro! I am sorry. What's the matter, honey? Do you miss Spider? Yes, but it's not. Okay. What is it then? I can feel her, Dad. - Mark who? - Eywa. I can hear her breathing. I can hear her heartbeat. She is so close. She is present... like a word that is right on the tongue. I know you think I'm crazy. You're not crazy, honey. So what does Eywa's heartbeat sound like? Powerful. Tell him what you told me. Do you like stargazing? My father came from a star. The one right there. - Lo'ak! - Now I'm on it. We will meet again. - The boy has been found! - The Sully boy has been found! Let me see you. He is unharmed. It's just a few scratches. Give me strength not to tear my eyes out at my son. No. My son knew not to take him outside the reef. The fault is his. Come on. No. It's not Ao'nung's fault. It was my idea. Ao'nung actually tried to talk me out of it. - Lo'ak. - Pardon. Come on. I will probably. - Is it true? - What were you thinking? You yourself said I should be friends with them. I don't want to hear about it. You have brought shame on the family. - Can I leave now? - Next time I'll tie a knot in your tail. - Is that understood? - Yes. Lima Charlie. - Where were you? - You should keep an eye on your brother. Pardon. Why did you speak for me? Because I know what it's like to be one big disappointment. Wish I had been there. The sea gave you a gift. The tulkuns have not come yet, and no tulkun swims alone. It did here. He was missing his one fin. The left one was only a stump. Payakan. Det er Payakan. - Who is Payakan? - A young, unruly bull. He is outcast and missing a fin. - He was supposed to be a killer. - He has killed Na'vi and Tulkuns. - Far down south. - He's not a killer. - You're lucky you survived. - Well, he saved my life. - He is my friend. - My little brother... The mighty warrior who fought a killer tulkun and survived. You don't listen. - I'm listening. - Lo'ak, come back. Payakan! Payakan! Payakan! Good to see you. Why are you outcast? What happened? It's too painful. I trust you. You can trust me. Oh, that's lame. Faster! So here we are. The Vig of the Ancestors is our holiest place. Eclipse is the best time to be here. There it is. The Spirit Tree. My pretty daughter. Hi Mom. It's nice to see you. But you look worried. Sweetie, it'll be fine. - What's wrong? - Why am I different? What does the Almother want me? Who was my father? Oh, my own… - Come now! - Kiri! Skin! - What's wrong? - She had a seizure. Is she breathing? - Get her home to the village. - Lets go! - Good to see you. - Neteyam, keep them away. - How is she? - Still unconscious. No bleeding, no breakage. The lack of oxygen has not damaged the brain. But there is interictal activity in the frontal lobe. She must have had a seizure. We can rule out toxins. - I'm not needed here. - You are tsahik. - Remove the remedies. - Out! You have done nothing! - Come on, we're taking a break. - Let me just take the drop out. Tuktirey. She said she could feel Eywa and hear her heartbeat. - It is typical frontal lobe epilepsy. - Epilepsy? One sees visions and experiences religious ecstasy like the one she described. The association with the Spirit Tree must have triggered it. Don't let her do that again. Never? Jake, if she has another seizure underwater, she could die. Kiri, you are awake. Kiri, sweet child. My lovely girl. Try this one: "I see you." I said that too. I don't know. Ngaati. Okay, it's going out through the nose. Chief, one of the patrols has detected a helicopter gunship on the radar. - Where? - Above the sea, 400 km to the north. Hold fast. The signal disappeared out over the open sea. But if you continue the course, you will hit this archipelago. There are hundreds of islands with countless villages. It's him. Give me some vessels and I will return home with his scalp. - We will be flown in. - Skipper. - Stop the engines. - Yes. Are you Scoresby? Are you the badass taking my ship? It is me. The target is the entire archipelago. I've never been up there. You know the waters. Who lives there? Primarily metkayinas, about 50 villages. Who are you? Ian Garvin, marinbiolog. If there are 100 villages, we search them all. I hunt tulkuns. That's what we do. I have quotas to meet. I'm being polite the first time. Then it's over. If you can't avoid it, get into it. - All men at their posts! - Hello, no pills. - Rudder threads, airspeed. - Yes. - What was it? - What's going on? The Tulkuns have returned! Our brothers and sisters are back! Their endless cycle of wandering had brought the Tulkuns home. Skin! - Kiri, come! - Tuk, leave me alone. - What is it you want? - Look! Let's go out and meet them. There is my soul sister. Sister, I see you. I see you and I am happy. Your son is very handsome. Thanks. How is your little one? My little one is strong. I have met a boy. Now stories had to be told about the time they had been apart. About death and births. About old friends and new love. TA'UNUI-LANDSBY Keep calm. We are looking for weapons, radios, technical equipment. Down on your knees! Can you see it here? Shut up! We know this man resides somewhere here on the islands. Is he here? Our tribe lives in seclusion. The man in the picture is from the forest. - What is he saying? - That forest people never come here. I don't buy it. He must search in the forest if he is to find that man. They know nothing. Shoot that animal. What are you doing? Take it easy. Are your ears working now? Now you have seen what they can do. Jake Sully. Toruk makto! He knows nothing. Kill her. Stop! Stop! Cut it out of cardboard for him. If he doesn't expose Sully, we'll kill the tsahik. No, I refuse. I don't want to be part of this. They know nothing! Are we really going to kill her? You must not do that. What you are doing here is so wrong! Do not. - Burn the cabins. - Set them on fire. Set fire to it all! - Forgive me. I did not know it. - You must stop the madness! - Forgive me. - We have slipped. Don't touch me! Come on. Sit up! - What's wrong? - Sky people. They're looking for you down south. They have a human boy with them who speaks Na'vi. - Have they killed anyone? - Not yet. They threaten to, but no one will reveal where you are. On my command. We must hunt this demon. Catch him and kill him. We have to think about it. If we attack Quaritch, they will follow us here with their full force. So what do we do? We are looking for toruk makto! Has he been here? - It is no use. - They are silent as the grave. If we continue, he'll just run away. We have to lure him out. I'm done. I have quotas to meet. Do you want to hunt? Then we hunt. Well not here? There are too many villages here. No no no. They do not understand the bond of community between the Tulkuns - - and the Havna'vi. It would be like murdering their family. If we hunt here, the savages will come after us. Exactly. One definitely wild. I know how you feel. I also feel completely alone. Tell me. Why were you expelled? I am sorry. It hurts me terribly. It is okay. You allowed it. You allowed him to bond with the outcast. Tsireya... You disappoint me, daughter. And you are the son of a great warrior. You are better raised than that. Payakan saved my life. They don't know him. Sit. Sit. Sit down! Hear my words, boy. In the time of the first songs, the tulkuns fought among themselves - - to gain territory and to get revenge. But they realized that killing, justified or not, - - just leads to more killing. Therefore, it was forbidden to kill. It is the way of life of the tulkuns. Payakan is a killer and therefore he is an outcast. - Sorry, but you are wrong. - Lo'ak, you are speaking to the olo'eyktan. - Well... - That's good! I know what I know. Then it's good. I'll take care of him. The storm will probably blow over. Lo'ak, I saw something today. I saw a forest boy selected by a tulkun. I am very proud of you. It was not Payakan who killed the boys. I saw it. The demon ship killed his mother, so he gathered the young bulls - - and the reef boys to attack the ship, and they were all killed.
