- You said that 10 minutes ago, Tom. - You'll lose your Job! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! What's below us? You rolling? We are inside one of the world's largest power plants, - Which supplies electricity to nearly 22 million consumers. It now seems that destined -- its going to be one of the biggest disasters in decades. For WTSE, this is Tom Merrick reporting live - - from inside burning Evanston Power Plant. Got it? - Got it! - Can we get just a few more shots before we go? - You said that 10 minutes ago, Tom! - This is what it means to be in the big leagues! - We need to get out! Look at this place! Go upstairs now, or you'll lose your jobs! Come on. Go! Look! Devil babies and resurrected dictators are out. I'll tell you when I need. An alien abduction or catastrophic disaster... What's it's been? An year without a decent earthquake or flood? That's terrible.... I wasn't sure if you're gonna make it. I'll take care of this later. Merrick. Oh! You are warm. So you are alive. - You looking well, Eleanor. - You look like crap. - I was going poverty-chic. - Always trying to stand out from the crowd. - Thank you for the job. - No need to thank me... I got an award-winning news man with chiken-feed. Never could understand why you quit. - I was misunderstood. - Yeah! Why you're a hero in my book. The tape you pulled under the power plant? Tops. The fact that network used it to grab ratings, and still pursuaded you to resign over it...hypocrites. So where do you want me to start? Basement, research. I need a piece on disasters. I figure if Mother Nature will not cooperate, the next best thing is to take my readers a blast through the past: "Disasters through history." - Starting out slow ? - You complaining already? - I see no reason to wait. - Good luck. This is a recording! Elizabeth Winter is not in today. I know you're there... Okay, I'm here, but not for long. Look, I'm trying to get out early today, y'know? -...we need those... -Actually, I have a little personal time, put a little balance back into my life. Liz, Liz, I need those columns for next week... come on, please? I'll do a complete search, but it's going to have to wait until tomorrow. What? No! No! Wait! Don't hang up! Excuse me... I'm Tom Merrick. And I'm overjoyed. - So... what are you doing here? - Grayson sent me. No! I mean why National Inquisitor? Is slumming here some kind of penance? - You work here? Yeah, but I'm not Tom Merrick. I had a bad day, led to a few bad years. - Look, if you could you set me up on your research computer? - Oh, you know what, I'll be back tomorrow and then I'm all yours. No! It can't wait. First day on the job, want to impress the boss. Okay. Photos, news articles, all online. The code word is Lizland. - Use the search engine and hard copies and file as subject. - What if I have a question? For emergencies only... Try to leave my desk like you found it. "What causes one disaster to become part of our collective consciousness, while another fades into history? Maybe some hold our attention - because they remind us of the power of Mother Nature over Man's technology. Others because they shows us how- - inherently flawed our most advanced technology can be. And still others because they reveal... " Crap. This is crap. What the hell... Hello? - It's Tom Merrick. - I hope this's an emergency. - Could someone have altered your data? - No way! I have a double firewall that would keep Bill Gates guessing! - What is it about, Merrick? - Mo, where do you get these pictures? They're all directly from in-house negatives, or from Smithsonian or Library of Congress archives - There has to be a mistake. - If there is I doubt it's on my computer. Merrick, look, can this wait until tomorrow? I've really gotta... Whatever it is Merrick, it can wait until tomorrow. I have Larry King and a heating pad waiting for me at home. Just take a look. Titanic, the Hindenburg fire, Hurricane Hugo. I hope for your sake you have more than a history lesson here. Take a closer look. Do you still want to catch Larry King? - What is this? - A guy shows at three disasters, a perhaps across nearly a hundred years without aging a day. Now, is it someone trying a hoax on us, or is this the most incredible DNA fluke in human history. - Or is he not human. - Come on Eleanor. It's just us here. And we're throwing out theories. I don't know what you found here Merrick, but this is absolutely amazing. Exactly what the Inquisitor needs to knock the socks off the globe. - I want 1000 words from you. - On what? We have no idea what this is all about. We don't even know if those photos are authentic. That's why you are flying to D.C. tonight. Nine o'clock flight. Use the company credit card to buy the ticket. No way. You have to send someone else. We get originals from Smithsonian and get forensic lab to authenticate them. I was looking for a nine to five job. Remember? No competitions. No stress. And make sure of its identification, I want to run this story day after tomorrow. - If there's a story. - If? Why the hell did you come up here if you don't think there's a story? Come on Merrick! Admit it! Your blood's flowing, you're all juiced up, and you love it! - You have not felt this good in a long time. - There has to be a reasonable explanation. Fine! The way to find it is to be on that flight. You have 36 hours to get me that story. Book Mr. Merrick on a flight to D.C. nine o'clock tonight. Coach. - Hello? - Kevin? - Hey, buddy. It's me. Your Dad. - I know. Listen Kev, I was wondering...I got a new job. I would really like if you came to Chicago. We could hang-out, watch the Cubs lose... - So. What do you think buddy? - I don't know. I gotta go. Steve's coming over. We're going to play some Quake. - I'll put Mom on. - Kevin, wait. -Mom! It's Dad. Please call him more than once every other month. Y'know, Tom, bad things happen to people all the time, but they do not just draw back and give up. This time get yourself a life. As life you and Steve given Kevin in Atlantic City? - I don't think you're in any position to give an opinion about that. - Hotel theme parks? Arcades? Casinos? - What is it going to do to our son? - Stop it, Tom. You know it's just your sorry way of glossing over the fact you don't like Steve being in Kevin's life. You know, Steve does things with Kevin. You know, he got us tickets to the final of the hockey championship at Cops Collosium. - Buying hockey tickets for a kid doesn't make him father of the year. - No! No, it doesn't, Tom. But Steve doing anything with Kevin, makes him more of a father than you. - Are you a photographer? - Attention, passengers! Please fasten your seat belts. No, reporter. So, like a newspaper? Yeah, like.... a newspaper. - Are you doing a story about that guy? - Maybe. Because if you are... ... he is right there. - Tighten your seat belt. - What? What is wrong? Well, folks, the fasten seat belt sign is lit so if you wouldn't mind fastening your seat belt at this time It'll be over as quick as possible! Thank you! - Sir, please take your seat. - Just a second. YOU ARE HERE.... TITANIC! EVANSTON POWER PLANT 12 DEAD HINDENBURG explosion 33 DEAD !! DEPARTURE 222 - 15 JUNE Please Sir! Just take your seat. - Today is the 15th, right? -Yes. Yes. - What's the flight number? It's Flight 222. COLLISION IN MID AIR 307 DEAD June 16th... That's tomorrow. CHICAGO GREEN LINE NOON SUBWAY CRASH Give me that. No one needs to get hurt. Just put the gun down. What the hell is gonna happen with this plane? Don't know! Just don't look! Land it! All right, if you calm down, we can discuss this. Bring it down now! Or we're going to be dead. Let's go. We got problems. No radar or communications. We got a bigger problem. He's not gonna hurt anybody. He just wants us to land, that's right, isn't it? The two nearest airports are Grand Rapid and O'Hare. Your call. - Which one is the closest? - O'Hare by maybe five minutes. Do it. Going down to 10,000 feet, course 2-niner by 6-2-0. - No, wait! - We will take it down, like you wanted. You got no radar, no radio. - What would you do,if I weren't here? - I don't understand. If you didn't have a gun pointed at your head, would you continue on to D.C? No. No, it is considered an emergency. Code one emergency. We'd land at the nearest strip. - Which is....which is you're doing anyway! - Yeah! - Bring her up. - I thought you wanted us to land? Bring her up now! There! Pull her up. Pull her up hard! - We've lost hydraulics. - Switch to manual. Both sides. We're on manual. 7000 feet. 6700 feet. - Damn it! - 6400 feet. 27 seconds to impact. - Come on! Come on! - 6000 feet. 22 seconds to impact. 5700 feet. Get her up, get her up. - 5500 feet. - I got her! I got her! We're levelling at 5500 feet. Are you alright? If we hadn't taken her up, we'd all be dead. How did you know? I won't be needing this any more. They're waiting for you in there. There was no way that guy wasn't on the plane. I saw him, the little girl next to me saw him, the flight-attendant saw him. Let's stop worrying about this alleged gentleman for a while... ... and concentrate on you. You see Mr. Merrick, you had the gun. You commandeered flight 222. Now in my experience, hijackers rarely work alone. I am NOT a hijacker. The plane was going down, and... - Why don't you tell us who else was involved? - No one! The last thing I wanted to do was even get on in that plane. Believe me! Believe you? Believe you? Mister I believe in looking directly into a man's eyes and letting the truth reveal itself. And right now as I look into yours, pfah! truth is nowhere in sight. Sorry. Ask the pilot. He'll tell you! As we speak, the agents are interviewing the all flight personnel and passengers, - - And I have a forensic crew sweeping the plane. Good! Then you'll find this brochure. The itinerary you supposedly saw that inspired you to pull out your gun? For the millionth time, it wasn't MY gun. It was his. The guy with the brochure, the guy we couldn't find the guy that does't show up on the flight manifest... ... He was not even on the damn plane when it landed? While you're sawing holes in my story - - There's a guy out there with a list of disasters. The subway is next.... I think. Something's going to happen to it. So now you have designs on a subway? I need to use a phone. I get a call, right? Stanton, why don't you bring Mr. Merrick a phone? And check with HG, have Merrick run through national BCI. Stanton, what exactly is that thing? The digital recorder built into my watch. I made it. You're sure that you want field work son? Maybe you should've stayed in MIT. Nothing wrong with being an engineer. I've always wanted to be in the Bureau. I mean....I figured switching to Quantico... I can be an agent and still have time to fiddle around with things like this. - By the way, if you ever want one... - Forget the watch. Focus on the old noggin. Remember that? Please, just find Grayson for me? It's an emergency. Wait, wait... Transfer me to Research. Sir! What Merrick did.... It doesn't make any sense. OK. Follow that line of thought... Well.. the guy hijacks a plane, doesn't ask for any money, doesn't make any demands whatsoever... So? What does that tell you? Think. Get a shrink down here. To see if Mr. Merrick's got all his marbles. Check the marbles. Check the marbles. - Research.. - It's Tom Merrick! I need a favor! You left my office in a complete mess, you hung up on me the last time we spoke, and now you want a... I found something in your system. Yeah! That's the point of using it...right? I do not understand it all yet, but it may be something big. Oh! Please Merrick! This isn't going to be one of those "story of the century" calls, is it? Do you have any idea how many reporters have thrown that stuff, my way? Any of them come in the aeroplane, forces it to land and get arrested by FBI? Yeah, right! I'm getting out of here. Wait, wait, wait! There is a file in your system. Merrick dot doc I dropped three photos in to it. I need you to make hard copies of each of them and and bring them down to me at the FBI office. I do not have time to be a delivery woman. Look, Merrik! I would like to help, but... - Listen to me! You are a researcher! So I hope that you're genetically curious! Pull the file. Have a look at it yourself. You won't be disappointed. Merrick dot doc I'm counting on you. Story of the century, my ass. "Titanic", "Hindenburg"... Oh, wow...! - When does he want it by? - I guess at the end of the day.... What happened to Baker? What's going on? Where are we going? Who the hell are you guys? Not now. Get an Emergency Medical Team to room 348 on the double. Put security on alert. Seal off the building. Merrick's escaped. Freeze! Drop the gun! Drop it! Drop it! Now! Against the wall. No !! Our orders are to stop him. Killing Merrick violates the non-intervention statute! Get out of the way! Move! Get out of the way! - Let's go! - What's that? Freeze! - Are you trying to kill yourself? - Come on. Let's go! - Come on! Let's go! - He was going to shoot us! Come on, let's move it! Surveillance displays Merrik's had at least two accomplices A woman of 5'3" tall, black hair. Wearing a black jacket. The other one is a man... Stay where you are! Get down! What the hell was that? It would be a Glock 17L with ballistic modificatins for an M 136. Right ? - Certainly, not a.... - That's enough! We got two male and two female pedestrians... -Moving east on Washington along the Federal building. They are armed and dangerous. Move in! Move in! Why are we running? Why am I running? What's going on? - What are you doing? - It's OK. It's a cop. They're coming! - If it's a cop, they're trying to shoot us! - What?? Here! Attention Please! Departing rail passengers proceed to trains on level 1... What have you got me into? -Fuck! What...? Ah!... The captain confirms what Merrick said! We should contact Grifasi. Where the hell are they? Just a second! You guys spread out. Cover the exits. I don't want any of them getting out of here. Alright! Listen! If passengers saw Merrick's guy on the plane, we should be able to get a sketch of him on the wires, pronto. Let's also get the sketches of the two who freed Merrick. What's the hell is going on? - All I know for sure is that the guy on the photos was on my flight. - What? He was there. And he had a brochure... of disasters. But that doesn't make any sense. I know! The flight we were on was in the brochure. My plane was gonna crash. That's why you were arrested. You hijacked the plane to stop it from crashing. Great! So that it makes me an accomplice to a hijacker. So! There was a guy in the plane with the brochure? Merrick and him working on the inside, those two goons and woman running with Merrick on the out. Now at least we got positive ID on her. The call we allowed Merrick to passed through to... an Elizabeth Wintern. She's a match with the woman he just fled with. So Merrik! Whatever all this is about... What are we supposed to do about it? The brochure he had was of past disasters. There's one that hasn't happened yet. A Subway wreck. Right here! On the green line at noon today. - But I ....I tried to tell the FBI, but they wouldn't believe me. - Well... I can imagine why.. Just one thing that's little odd. The captain on the flight confirms what Merrick said. That Merrick prevented a mid-air collision? So then he's not a hijacker. Merrick pulled the gun. He and this other guy probably tried to hijack it... but got cold feet. End of story. Now...The three big questions: How did Merrick know to prevent the mid-air collision? How did the guy with him get out of the plane, and passed the security....and why? Why is Merrik running from the people who just sprung him? - I don't know, sir. - I don't know either...we'll damn well find out. Son! We're coming! You'll have to wait for us until we process the signal! What's the hell is wrong with it? I don't know. He is in a shielded containment bunker. Normally shouldn't have affected communication. Sir...if you can read me... have them charge up the stands of this place. We need a reset. We can't reset you! We have serious problems here, going to take some time to address! - What is he saying? - Make it through all this stuff, we'll have some major deviations! - If that's not bad enough, I got the time the Time Feds after me. - Having trouble in getting him. Find the bastard and eliminate him! If he keeps on saving lives - It won't be a question of when you come back it'll be a question of if! "If" my ass! Wait a second, Cortez. We can not afford any unspecified casualties. There won't be any unspecified ones. We have to stop it before something happens. We have twenty minutes. Let's go! Hold it for a sec! You even don't know if something's gonna happen. Or even if it did, how'd you know which train is going to crash? No, I don't know. But if we don't get every train on that line stopped, one's gonna be history. It's clear. It's them! Out of the way! Out of the way! Find a security guard, anyone and say that there is a bomb and they need to stop all trains. - What're you gonna do? - I'm going to find a way to kill the power to the tracks and... And what? What is it? It's him! This is the train. We've got to get out of here. Go! Hey! - How many more stops on this line? - There're six. The last is Hill Horn. Why? This is Baker. I need security units in every subway stop between... - between Union and Hill Horn immediately- Let's get some cars. Merrick, this train is not stopping. There he is... - I do not know how you got photos you found, but it's Thrill Seeker's fault. Not mine. - Thrill Seekers? What's gonna happen to this train? I won't tell...that's part of the agreement. This is Murray Trevor requesting an emergency reset now! What are you doing? I need that to get off the train and I need it to get home! - How is this train gonna crash? - Ok! The engineer? He had a heart attack. When he died he didn't release the deadman's switch. So the train kept accelerating. Just after Clayton it couldn't hold the tracks on a curve. - He's talking about this like it already happened. - Because it did! About 70 years ago. I'm a tourist. The flight you were on, it was supposed to be the biggest mid-air collision in US history. Because of you nothing! Zero! Zilch! I'd better get a refund! - Merrick, this is insane. Just stop this train. - No! You can't do that. Just...Just give me that. - Do you travel to disasters? - Disasters, sporting events... - It's only a few minutes left. - Let's go! Wait...wait...It's against rules to intervene. Please give me back my RTT! Please! You do not understand! I need it! Please Open up! Open up! It's an emergency! Open up! It is Whittier. Clayton is three stops away. We have maybe two more minutes. Open up! Open up! - He can't hear you. He is dead! - The emergency brake. Damn. - Maybe we can separate this car from the others. - No! We don't know how to do that. Everyone! This train's gonna crash! Move into the rear coach now! Go! Go! Go! Please! Give me back my RTT! Move! Move! C'mon! Move it! Down the rearmost coach! Train's gonna crash! It is the last chance, come on! I can't wait for you. - What do we do? - I don't know. Look around! This is it. One on each side. Both at same time. Come on, jump! Come on! Jump! What now? Come on! Move back! Train's gonna crash! Move back, everybody. Keep moving. Get on the floor now. Get down! Hey! Thanks. - Is this your place? - My folks'. They're out of town. Dad always said you can never have too many power tools. Do you surely know what you're doing? Yeah! I once saw him use it when I was around three. It looked so easy... kidding. Kidding! Hold that stretcher. - Sure, we have a match. - Get him out of here. - Oh! Surprise me. - We talked to the passengers. Merrick and Wintern were on this train, but they're gone. - Any luck at Union? - The other two also escaped as well. Oh! Great! It's great! Okay, listen up folks! I want an all-out search on Merrick, Wintern and the two unidentified perps. Check all hospitals, motels, hotels within 50 miles radius. You know the drill. I want everyone stopped, I don't care if he's driving, walking or riding a horse. You know what these four look like. Now, results! Let's do it! Go! - I'm not getting a contact. - If you hadn't stopped me from wasting him the first time... - They were not our orders. - That train weck would have gone down. We were supposed to interrogate Merrick, determine the point of deviation and reset. We didn't interrogate him, and thanks to you he's still walking. Don't let this on me. The man's figured us out. He knows. ... this kept the death toll now standing at two. ....of course it could have easily been in the hundreds. It is the first subway crash in the city has eperienced in 20 years. Transportation authorities now speculating that operator error... - Right from the dryer. - Thanks. I have trying to put the pieces all together... In the plane... That brochure I saw... It listed the Evanston Power Plant fire.... It stated that 12 people died. There was only 11 dead. Who is the 12th? - Me. - What? The tourist guy travels to disasters. And Power Plant fire was one of his stops. That's right. His coin was there. The one he had on the train. He must have dropped it, and when I saw it... I hesitated. I mean...long enough to change things forever. Because if I hadn't stopped when I saw it... ... I would have been killed right along with my crew. - You can't know that for sure. - It makes sense. I am alive because that tourist from the future... dropped the coin. And those two freaks.... they're from the future too. They have to stop me before I alter their past. This is nuts. Okay? The guy from the train was nuts. But if some future scientist were to develop technology for people to travel through time - - Do you really think this is what they use it for? Foo tourism? For entertainment? If what you're saying is true, these people aren't coming back to see some TV image gets blown to bits. They are coming to see thousands of real live people die.... - It's sick. - I don't see how it is any worse than tuning into 6 O'clock news... Or reporting. - Hey! There's no comparison between you and them. - Isn't there? I've watched some of your news segments... Occasionally... Sometimes I got carried away. Remember the time you drew right up to that tornado? That was quite a piece, wasn't it? Thank you for purchasing Thrill Seekers' ten pack! Your best value at temporal travel entertainment! Your 10 pack covers some of most famous disasters in the history... - What did you do? - I do not know. Starting from April 14, 1912, sinking of the "Titanic" - and the December 24, 1998 the catastrophic fire at the Evanston Power Plant. And of course the big three. That's right. Those legendary 3 days in June when you get back to back, to back a plane crash, - - A train wreck and the grand daddy of all disasters... The Copps Coliseum fire.... that killed more than 11,000 people... It's tomorrow! When you're ready to begin your first trip just use remote temporal transmitter- - with the built in isometric frequency blocker - - that guarantees shielding against Time Fed detection. Within seconds we'll wisk you away to the start of an adventure... - He's there. At Copps Coliseum. - Who? My son. - Hello? - Kevin, I need to talk to your mother! - She's not here. Christie's here. - Okay! I need you to listen very carefully. I can't explain how I know this! But tomorrow during the hockey game, there's gonna be a fire. - You, your mother and Steve cannot be there. - I don't understand! I'll explain later. Just promise me you won't go to the game. - No! I wanna go! - Kevin, this is one time you gotta trust me. Promise me you won't go! Talk to me, Kevin. - Mom said you might get jealous, because I'm doing stuff with Steve. - No, it is not that, believe me... I guess that he didn't believe you? - I've got to get there. I've gotta stop them from going. - Okay! Maybe there's something else we can try. You suggested a bomb threat somewhere! We can try that at Copps Coliseum. No! There are situations like that all the time. When the security sweeps and when they don't find anything, the game goes on as planned. We can give the device you took from the time traveller. That will get their attention. Maybe! But by the time you explain what the hell it is, the Coliseum will all be in history. No! This is an emergency! The FBI would be able to move in pretty quickly. No matter what FBI comes up with those two people will destroy the arena. They need those 11,000 people dead. Maybe we can slow them down. Wintern got parents in The Heights, couple of friends in Eastburn... ... And one ex-boyfriend on the Gold Coast. Put him through. It's patched trhough from the Bureau. It's Merrick. Line 2. I didn't cause the subway wreck. I tried to stop it from crashing. Then why not turn yourself in? The man and woman who grab me from your office they tried to stop me from saving it. Now they wanna take down Copps Coliseum tomorrow during the hockey championship. You got to stop them. I'll tell you what! Why don't you come down here and work with me to identify who these two are... Thank you. We got it. It's her parents' place. The sketches I ordered of those two that helped Merrick to escape, I want them to be delivered - - along with the photos of Merrick and Wintern to the Copps Coliseum security. Tell them to get extra police and firemen there, just a precaution. So you believe him, you think that those other two will try to take down Copps? I do not believe a damn thing he says. But I do believe in covering all the bases. - Would you like me to call off the search Sir? - Hell no. Maybe he's just trying to throw us off. Oh! You gotta be kidding? I should be there in three hours if I fly. You are suspected hijacker. If you go near an airport, the cops will be all over you. Don't worry. It's old, but it'll get us there. - Us? If we trade off driving even if we stay away major highways - - We'll get to Copps Coliseum in 15 hours. Well before the game. I already emailed my mom. I told her that we're taking the car. So...well... Let's get out of here! - Finally getting him. - How could you let this happen? What the hell is going on? Why does he look different? - Hmm, must be some kind of temporal leakage... Do you have any idea what you've done? By not stopping Merrick, nearly 500 people lived, who were supposed to die. So? Time Feds probably zeroed in on your organization again. Just kick up the hush money and... - Do you think that we're dealing with some law enforcement issue - What else is there? Just a few little problems like population shifts in the hundreds of millions, - plus new governments and technology popping up and disappearing, that you've never even heard of? - What happening in L.A.? - Who cares about L.A.? My kid lives in L.A. Southern California was wiped out in a fusion melt down 22 years ago. What? I have to get back to my time. You have to get us a reset now! You still don't get it! Do you? Your timeline does not exist any more. Do you understand? Your family, your friends are all gone. And temporal accelerator... that's right... The core technology of Stanza-displacement... Somebody Merrick saved one on that plane killed its inventor - In an automobile accident three years before he invented it. So right now we can't reset anybody anywhere. But Sir you're in a containment bunker. So the accelerator should be shielded against any timeline deviations. We never had deviations of this magnitude before. It's blown all of our theories right out of the water. I assume we've got a team working on it? A team? Get the whole damn conglomerate on this. I have to get a reset and save my son. Listen Cortez! I have bigger problems here than worrying about your progeny! If we are lucky, I repeat if we are lucky, we might have a working model within a week. - Then you can reset us? - We can stop Merrik before he gets on that plane. That's the plan. But nothing's gonna happen unless we get a stable temporal zone. That means that you two have to make it damn sure that Merrick doesn't cause any more deviations- - from the current timeline, or it's over for all of us. How do we find Merrik now? He's got a client's RTT. He doesn't know that's how we're tracking him. - I'll transmit his coordinates to you now. Standby. - Standby for download...download complete. - We have them. - Good. Now... whether you get Merrick or not we're going to need some insurance. Insurance? The last of the big three disasters... The fire at Copps Coliseum.... No matter what Merrick does... make sure it comes down.... - You gotta be kidding? - Fire or no fire... - 11,369 people need to die! It's our only chance. Sir, with all due respect, I am a temporal security agent, not a murderer. Consider it done! - Hey! Wait a minute. - You screw this up, Felder and I'll kill you. - I'm the least of your worries, Cortez. - What the hell are you talking about? You saw Grifasi. We got a temporal containment leak. Few more deviations, Grifasi and the whole organisation... ... will not know even we exist. Merrick, if this is all true... ... maybe we shouldn't interfere. - Then 11,000 people will die. - I know, I know! But it's just that, the guy from the photos, warned us about interfering. The two who are after are gonna kill or risk being killed to stop us. What if somebody we save goes on to cause something so terrible- - to happen which is much worse than Copps Coliseum coming down. I don't see it that way. If those three people are from the future - - Then yes! Their past is set, it can only go down one way. But our future can go on infinite number of ways. Any one of which may be a whole lot better than the world they are from. Or a whole lot worse. You're right. But all what we can do is act on what we do know. And knowing that 11,000 people are going to die, including my son, - - I'm ready to do whatever I can do to save them. At this speed we should intercept Merrick in about five minutes. It's very simple. Canvas this area for any neighbors who may have eyeballed traffic coming in and out of here. And look for some security cameras, whatever. Sir, I found these and an e-mail. She had obviously attempted to trash her sent-mail bin, - but I just ran a digital recompiler... - Just get to the point, Stanton. - She borrowed her mother's car. They're heading to the Copps Coliseum. - Damn! This is Baker. They're definitely headed for Copps. That's right! Call off the local search. Focus everything there. Let's go! Merrick, can I ask you a question now? Only if you keep calling me Tom. Ah! I got this feeling earlier as if you and your son aren't that close. I was just wondering what happened? After the plant fire, I.... shut down... from work, the world, everyone... You can't just drop out of a kid's life, and expect waltz back in when you're ready. You must really miss him. Do you miss his mom, too? From day one our marriage lost out to my job, to the jolt I got from covering disasters. You were that hooked on it? Until I got those men killed. That was when I crawled into my cave and disappeared. Now that you're out of hibernation, what do you think? I'm liking parts of it. Maybe we should stop for gas. He stopped. Just ahead. Time to put him out of our misery. - Fill her up. - Check the oil and tires? - That would be great. I'll handle this. - Son of a bi.... - Why are you trying to kill me? Did you ever stop to think about the consequences of what you're doing? Maybe my son is dead, because you decided to stop the plane from crashing. Oh my god! Come and help me! - How long till we're there? - I don't know. I said how long? May be 50 minutes. It's okay, it's okay. Stay there. Just stay there. It's alright. The ambulance is here. It's alright. No! Elizabeth! There's nothing you can do for her. Hey, what do you think you're doing? That's my truck! Officer! Park it for me. Will you? Looks like local boys took our warning hard. What are you doing now? Setting for local time. Working on creating a watch that sets it for longitudinal changes, automatically resets... - Resets to whatever time zone you're in. - I can hardly wait. I can hardly wait. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a full house! 16347 spectators to watch the game. Hi, I'm Baker. I don't know if anything is really going to happen, but if it's possible to get the fire department... - Ladies and gentlemen! - Awesome! Welcome to Copps Coliseum! Home of the division champions. Here is tonights starting lineup. We got fire! Fire! Cortez, Merrick's dead. The fire which is supposed to bring this place down will still work, so we don't actually need to kill anybody. Listen to me! It is one thing is to defend an existing timeline. An other thing entirely, to purposedly invoke a disaster. Have you listened to a word I've said? Do you feel any responsibility? What kind of a person are you? Kind that'll do anything, anything, to stabilize this timeline, - - long enough to get a reset and save my son. You understand? - You don't give a damn about any of them. Do you? - To the extent that they can screw up our timeline. - Yeah! -They're people. - They are dust! If you're so worried about them, why the hell are you here? Do you think I wanna be doing this? Working for some two bit underground firm - that uses the greatest technology ever invented for amusement rides? - I was a Ged once. - Yeah, right. I was with the government temporal development programme, Cortez. Oh! Let me guess! When they shut it down and illegalised time travel... - You were already hooked. I'm trying to figure. Who is lower on your moral scale.. Me, who does it for the money, or you, who does it for thrills? The tragedy struck when a series of explosions devastated the arena - - killing nearly two thirds of the 16,000 spectators. Although authorities won't speculate... Lord, have mercy on his soul. This is Tom Merrick! Leave a message at the tone! Merrik, it is Eleanor! You're not battling hijacking charges for the public defender. There's an old buddy of mine, Irwin Thompson renowned defense attorney, - he's agreed to represent you during Tuesday call me. I'll give you the details. Good job with the Copps Coliseum! The stable temporal zone you created works! We'll be ready in a few minutes to reset you. Permanent insertion point 24 hours prior to Merrick getting on that flight. That'll give us plenty of time to stop him. Just name any of these disasters, and you'll instantly be transported back in time - - exactly three hours prior to the disaster you select. One more thing! Stanza-displacer is still unstable. And each test run is causing multiple burn outs. Bottom line.... You only have one round trip ticket. Back to stop Merrick from getting on that plane and rerouting our timeline - - and then back here, to home. We are online now! Good luck! Copps Coliseum fire. Now that you have come out of hibernation, what do you think? - What the hell? - This is all wrong. You're alive! Yes! Last time I checked. What is wrong with you? Nothing. We are back at Copps Coliseum three days late. Somebody must have inserted an alternate date. - What the hell are you doing ?! - Connecting with Grifasi. He already said he has no more resets on this timeline! We have no choice. We have to take Merrick and Copps Coliseum down again. And then wait a week for Grifasi to generate a new reset. - Maybe we should stop for gas. - No! We definitely don't wanna do that. You're not one of those guys who refuse to pull over till the car's running on fumes, right? In this case, yeah. We'll get some near the Coliseum. - What are you doing? - Those guys who were after us from the train station.. Let's just say I have a very informed hunch - - That this leads them straight to us. This time we'll be out of our misery for good. Where the hell is Merrick? Hey! Did you have a 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass here filling up in last few minutes ? An Oldsmobile Cutlass? No. You want me to check the oil and tires? Over here. Damn it! Hey! It's been working out. We'll get your son back too. Officer! Park it for me. Will you? Looks like local boys took our warning hard. What are you doing now? Setting it to local time. Working on creating a watch that's sensitive to longitudinal change, and'll automatically... - Automatically resets to whatever time zone you're in. - I can hardly wait. I can hardly wait. I'm Baker. This is Stans. I can't guarantee that anything's gonna happen, but thank you for taking precautions and getting the fire... Sorry, you can't come in. - Excuse me, there's a family here I have to get to. It's a... the grandmother, it's an emergency. - What's the name? - Ah! Lindquist! A couple more... ... We'll be ready to go. Lindquist party! Please report the first-aid station on the main con-course. Thank you. - If you could just point me to the first-aid station? - Sure! Absolutely. All right! Just go right outside this door here, straight down the hallway, and when you get to the end... Open this door! Open this door! - Steve! Could you take Kevin some place? - They just paged us. It's an emergency. No. There is no emergency. - I'm testing. - Hurry! Hello? Is this thing working? Attention! Attention!... - What are you doing here Tom? - There's gonna be an explosion. We have to get out of here. Right! Last time you told Kevin there was gonna be a fire. And this....? What are you trying to do? Attention! There's a bomb in the arena! Repeat! There's a bomb in the arena! - Please! Evacuate immediately! - We have to get Kevin. Please try to be calm! Leave by the emergency exits! Please stay calm! Repeat! There's a bomb in the arena! OK! I'm out of here. We gotta do this now, before any more of these people get out. Where's Kevin? Dad! I'm not gonna let you do it this time. You idiot. Put the detonator down, Cortez! - You have any idea what you're doing? - Now! Merrick! This way. I made it! Jen! We must try to get out of here! No one move! Drop your weapon! Drop it! Get out of the way! - We're trapped! - How do we get out of here? Stanton! You are Stanton! You shouldn't have invented Stanza-displacer. You shouldn't have invented... Stay down. Merrick! Put it down! Damn you! Put it down! Put it down! - If I do that, we all are dead. - I'm not negotiating. Down! Now! We are trapped. You've seen what weapon could do. - It's our only way out of here. - Ah, he may be right. Shut up Stanton. Put it down! Now! My leg! Everybody out. Now! Now! My leg... Easy. Thank you! Stanton! What I said earlier, about you not having what it takes for field work? Ignore it. But Sir! I think I'm gonna take your suggestion and look into to the technical... ...killing 200 of the 16,000 in attendance, now authorities can't speculate... Kevin! Kevin! Kevin! Mom! - Are you okay? - Yeah, fine. How did you know about all this? It's a long story. I'll tell it to you some day. Thank you. Am I gonna see you soon, Kevin? - Yeah! - Sure. Anytime. Look! I've got to take care of something. - See you real soon. - Okay! - Bye. - You can't stand here, folks. Elizabeth! Where are you going? - Look, Tom... - Tom. You called me Tom. That's, that's good. Tom. It looked like you were staying, and I didn't really want to interfere. Anyway, I thought... We at Time Shifters, hope that you enjoyed this rare and infamous moment, - - that combines the first three disasters with genuine startle selectors. And now it's time to take a deep breath and get those cameras out! As we prepare to temporaly reset you to one of most fantastic catastrophes in history. Are you ready?
