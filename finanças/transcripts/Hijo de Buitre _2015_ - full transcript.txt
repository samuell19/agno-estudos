I found them, ma'am. Those fucking peasants have to sell their lands. If they don't get it, kill them. Got it. THE SON OF "EL CAPO" It's done. And what happened? I caught them pissing, man. - Alright. Let's go, dude. - Let's go, then. Please, leave. - Step aside, Julia. - Go away or I'll scream! Step aside! Who's going to hear you, huh? You'll do as I say. And I say that you have to be mine. You bastard! - Coward! - Don't insult me, bitch! You are delicious! Guess what? I got the money to buy my own cows. - Really? - Yeah. Really, Mateo? I'm glad. Ouch! What's wrong, idiot! Calm down, Regina. He's not very well, but he does what he can. Well, if he's sick, you pay him. People have to be healthy here, if not they're out. Have some patience with him, he's done a lot for your ranch. But he has been paid. If he is sick, he is useless. Help me! Help me! Ouch! Please, help me, Mateo! Oh, this pain! - Are you okay? - I'm okay now. Don't worry. Get out of here. I swear this time I'll tell my dad. Don't be stupid! If you tell him you would sign his death sentence. Remember that my parents and I could kill him. You're such a bastard! Someday you'll pay for all your injustices. And who's going to make me pay? You? I'm the owner of this town, of this house, and yours as well. And if someone wants to make me pay... they'll have to deal with this. Looks like that plastic bowl isn't working. Don't worry, you are not going to be fired. - Tell me, how is your side feeling? - It's getting better, Mateo... but since I fell from that horse... Do you remember? I haven't been able to recover. Ah! What a shame! But take care, okay? I'm going to give you a girdle. But keep going to the doctor. You're such a kind person, Mateo. I don't know why you work for those buzzards. For the same reason you do. Necessity, Filemon. Sheer necessity! I'll need more money. I already gave you enough don't you think? I need to go to the ranch. No, no. Go back home. Come on. Go home. I casually showed up and offered him my condolences. You are the biggest bitch ever, mom. He will sell it to us. Maria! Maria, bring us the food! - She's so stupid! - It's okay, mom. I'm meeting up with dad to have some drinks. Okay? So, I'm leaving now. By the way, don't worry about the widow, I'll deal with her. But remember those lands and the ranch are mine. Tell your dad this is not a hotel. That he can't show up when ever he wants to. That's your own business. I don't want it anymore. - Sorry, ma'am. lt's just... - What? Seems like you're getting too old tor this. - Get out of here. - Yes. THE HACIENDA SNACK BAH Hug her, jerk! You look like an old man. I don't like any of these chicks, dad. Oh, son. You don't know what you're saying. Here, the model is not important only the mileage. That's a new one. Do you want me to tell you something? Do you know who's the chick I really like? Who? I'll call her for you. Martina. Who? Martina. One of these days you'll see, I'm going to fuck her. You know, son, that bitch is not tor you. She has very high mileage. What about these ones? No, no. Wait a minute. These are very recent models... as well as being gorgeous. You shouldn't care about the rest. I don't, but... I like real women. These are just toys. You don't know what you're saying. You really don't. I thank you all for being by my side in this moment of grief But I can't take it anymore. - I'm sellin to the Menchacas. - You're nuts, Angela. You'll mess ll all up, especially after your husband's efforts and death. Then I quit! I don't want my son to suffer the same fate that my husband did. Is this your last word? Sorry, brother. I'll close the deal today. That's the worst decision that your sister could make. The more these morons buy, the more powerful they become. What did you expect? They own most of the town. We can't make her take it back, can we? I don't think so. She told me she is afraid they'd kill her son. What if we both go? Who knows. She might change her mind. No. She must be with those morons by now, and she is so stubborn. But maybe Samuel could help us. Uhm. Well, I don't trust him that muoh. He is a cop. I've known him for years, and he is a good person. What's up, Matias? What brings you here? Problems, Samuel. I guess you know my brother-in-law was killed. Yeah, man. Word already spread through the town. Give my condolences to your sister. Samuel, I need you to help me. You're a good man whom I trust. Look, strange things are happening around. I'm already digging into it. I hope I can get them soon. - And... - I told you, he is just like them. Samuel, can you take me to Nemesio? Watch out what you'll tell the commander, because after that, he can give you a hard time. Let me see if he's here. I told you he could help us. Rosendo. I need you to help me, please. My son got sick and I need you to lend me some money, please. How dare you ask me for money in front of everyone! - Fuck off! - Hel.. help me, please. Please! Go home, I'll meet you there. Can't you fucking hear me? Fuck off! Don't be mean, sir. Women shouldn't be treated like that. - Shut the fuck up! - No more, sir. Get to work! Now! Move your goddamn ass! Hey! Hey! Where do you think you're going? You and your people. This is my boss's office. Nobody goes in there. You can block them, but not me. Get out of the way. I won't move. - I don't want any trouble. - I don't. You won't? Ouch! Okay, okay. Be my guests! You can go in, but watch out what you tell the commander. - Be careful, please. - Thanks, Samuel. So now it turns out I have to tell you every step I take. Of course, and don't mess up with me! Don't you mess up with me! And don't talk to me like that. Mom, dad... Angela is here to sign the papers. Good, we were waiting for you. We are really sorry about your husband. Thank you for the sympathy. There's no rush, we can wait for another time, if you want to. Are you kidding? It looks like she is in a hurry. - We'd better close the deal. - I want to close it right now. This afternoon is my husband's funeral, and I want to leave this town immediately after it. Alright, as you wish. Here's your money. Paid in cash. Although it could've been done by bank transfer, - but you wanted it that way. - No. It's okay. Go with her, son. She shouldn't walk by herself with all this money. Okay. After you. My brother-in-law has been killed, and you know who did it. If I knew, they'd be behind bars. Come on! You know who the killers are in this town. And who are they? Rosendo and his family. That's a very serious accusation. Sure you know they've always coveted Rogelio and Angela's ranches and lands. What a coincidence that after my brother-in-law's death, my sister is about to sell them. Well, say something! Are you keeping your mouth shut? So? About what? I told you I don't like to be contradicted. Here we go again. I come home seeking peace, quiet and harmony. And that's the last thing I find here. - See you. - Where are you going? To look for something I can't find here. Quiet. Where the hell are you going? Where the hell are you going!? It's not my fault that after the first problem they go and sell it. They are the ones who cause troubles. They intimidate us and force us to sell to them. Fine. I'll talk to them, but I can't promise you anything. You'd better fix this, Nemesio. Or I'll talk to the federal police. I don't work under threats, Eladio. Why don't you get out of here and I'll see what I can do. Tell them that our lands are not for sale. Get out of here. If you don't help us, we'll talk to the governor. I told you to get out of here! Genaro? Is that you, son? We came to comfort you. - Call him. - No! Call him. Genaro! Genaro! - Mom! - Where do you think you're going? - Mom! Mom! - Son! I'm glad you came, kid. Now, I'm going to show you... how to make love to a woman. What for? There's no time, we are going to kill them now, aren't we? - No! No! - No! Mom! No! Here is the money. Let's get out of here. Here you go, boss. - Did you have any problem? - No, not at all. Angela and her family vanished from Earth in the blink of an eye. - Right? - Yeah, that's it. Good job, guys! You deserve some beers and hot chicks. - On you? - Of course. - All right, let's go! - Let's go, boss. I'm going to introduce you to a lady... I'm getting in, whether you like it or not. We'll see about that! What the hell is going on here! These guys want to force their way in, commander. Let them in! What the hell do you want, now? We demand you arrest those criminals for my sister's murder! Cool down, Matias. Tell me what are you talking about? She and my nephew were killed last night. How do you know that? Cause she told me she was going to meet them. Where was your sister's body found? In her house, and we didn't find the ranch deeds. See? Anyone could have done that. - It could have been a burglary. - Why are you here? What's your problem? Let's go. We're nor getting anything from this good-for-nothing. Let's see what the Governor has to say. Out of my way! - Did Paco bring you the money? - Yeah, there it is. Hey! Hold on. Remember that it's up to me to take it to the bank. You are acting weird lately, Rosendo. What's wrong with you? I don't know what's going on, but everything in this house belongs to both of us. Yes, that's pretty clear. And half of that is yours too. After all, you can take it to the bank. Come on! Take it! No. You take it. Go away! My dad is about to come home. I don't care. I like intense emotions. This time I'll scream! You really want to see your father dead, don't you? Go away! Go away! Can I have a napkin? What do you want? Don't stare at me like a hungry dog. What do you want, Romualdo? Leave that, Mateo! Come on! Leave this wheelbarrow. Don't do this kind of work. Don't worry, I'm just like you. And I want to help, so we can finish soon. Give me that. Why do you want to finish soon? I want to invite you over for a meal. But only because Julita's food is so delicious! - Take your wheelbarrow. - And you the rest. - Hi, Regina! - Hello. I need to talk to you. You're not going to like what I have to say. What's wrong? Look, it's kind of serious. Because you don't deserve... - What the fuck is going on!? - Ma'am, ma'am. The commander phoned you. You are so inopportune, Maria. I've told you not to disturb me when I'm busy. The commander wants to talk to you, in the same place as always. Don't worry, Regina. We have plenty of time. We'll talk later about the other thing. Excuse me. Move! You'll see, Julita. Sooner or later, you are going to love this. Go to hell! My dad! What are you doing here, Paco? - I came to give you a message. - Yeah... Don Fil... Don Rosendo wants to see you. Even if it is their ranch, this is my house... and I don't want you to be here. And tell your father... that if he wants something, he should say it when I'm working. Okay? And you... get out of here! - Are you kicking me out? - Not at all! I'm inviting you to get out of here! Bye, Julia. I have never trusted this guy, Mateo. Neither do I. Honey... Honey... If this guy is bothering you, please tell me. - Don't hide it, okay? - Of course I won't, dad. But please, sit down. I'm sure you're here to eat. You guessed right, Julita. When I come with your dad, it's always for that. - Right, Mateo? - Yes. Please, sit down. - Thank you. - I'm going to wash my hands. Okay, go ahead. Did you cook seafood? - So, that's what is going on - Yeah. The biggest troublemaker is Matias. He and Eladio said they will talk to the Governor. - They're not going anywhere. - Why not? Do not rely on that. Their nerves make them dangerous. They're just poor wretches. I insist. Don't take it for granted. Don't worry. You'll receive a lot more than this. With all this gratitude... I'll keep on being faithful to you... my lady. Go, and don't worry. It's time to teach those bastards a lesson. What's up, Matias? Hey, I don't know why you want these lands if they're useless. Useless! If they're useless, then why do you want them? Let's see how tough you are. This is just a warning. Next time we'll kill you and your family! Let's go. What?s wrong, honey? Why do I get such a welcome? I'm so sorry, Filemon. I just thought that... That it was that bastard, right? I don't know what you're talking about. Of course you do. I heard you talking yesterday, you said you wouldn't go to school, - so I came here to talk to you. - Filemon, just go. - I don't know what you mean. - You know exactly what I mean. That guy, Paco, has been molesting you. Someone has to help you, so here I am, darling! Your father is not going to know, he's at the stable. Come here. Oh, Filemon! I can give you whatever you want but don't you ask me for money in front of people ever again. But you shouldn't have treated me that way. Oh, I shouldn't? Shouldn't I? Imagine if Regina finds out. You know she's crazy. And I have so much to lose. The best thing would be to split up. So now you're the one who decides if we break up or we don't, and when? You were the one who said that if Regina finds out about us, - you'll be in trouble. - If she finds out. That's why we must be more careful. You also told me that we would... live together, have our own house, I can't wait to be with you. I want to wake up at your side. Finally, the truth came out. I know when things should be done, ma'am. - Stop it. - Stop it. - It's time to go home, come on! - Two more minutes, just a little while. For cuddles. What's the point then? That bloody bastard! So, since that day he's been molesting you? Yes. The worst thing is I think I'm pregnant. No way, Julita! It's going to be such a big deal! That's what I want to avoid. What should I do? Calm down. In the meantime, don't tell Mateo. - I'll deal with that bastard. - Thanks, Filemon. Well... just trust me. You also have to see a doctor to confirm the pregnancy. And don't worry about the baby, I'll take care of him. Thank you. Come on! Chicken? Why are we eating this, mom? I fired Maria. Don't you see the only ones she hasn't fired are us? - You have no choice, jerks. - Well, we can't argue with that. - Martina. - Where the hell were you? - My son is a little bit sick - Well, you should have let us know. I was about to kick you out. Calm down, honey. Don't be so hard on her. She is a good worker. And she has always been with the family, no matter what. I don't want any skin, I prefer thighs. Stop it, you idiot! What's your problem? When did I teach you that? Have I ever behaved like that? Uh? Respect her. I fired Maria so I want you to be here full time. Let me think about it, I have to take care of my son. Take it or leave it. Okay. Come on, don't be so hard on her. She also has duties at home. Martina, help yourself. - I want to talk to you, kid. - I've got nothing to say to you. You're wrong, we have so much to talk about. - What the fuck do you want? - I want to talk about Julita. If Mateo finds it out, he is going to kill you. - What do you mean? - You know exactly what I mean. I just want to help you. If you want to keep breathing, why don't you come to my place tonight to talk. Why did you want to see me so urgently, Regina? - Just because. - Really? I've decided to give back the lands to Angela's brother. Whoa! Whoa! Why? A friend of mine, a notary, is taking care of it. What for? So I can get them back later. My God, Regina! When it comes to you, it's better to take it easy, because as an enemy, you are very dangerous. - I'm glad you think that way. - Yeah? - When are you going to stop them? - When you give me the papers. I'll send them to you tomorrow. Now go, I'm busy. - Oh, I see. - Go. After you. She's so damn hot! Well, well, well. Almost. Here it goes. You want some? I didn't mean the whole bottle. I want to talk to you. I'm all ears. I want us to live together. Where? You said we'd live together, and it's been quite a while since then. I can't stand your wife anymore. I can't stand her either. Let alone your son. He's harassing me all the time. Fucking kid, I'll have to talk to him. Come on. Tell me when. I can't wait to be with you. I've told you a million times. Me too, but... look, I left the house looking for a bit of peace and here, it's the same thing. No. - Well, I always try to please you. - Really? - Yeah. - Let's see. Come closer. - Come here. - Not until you promise me. I don't like to promise things that will take a while to happen. Alright then. Think about it, I'll go home. Okay. Thanks, Julita. I think you're ready for marriage, you're an excellent cook. What's wrong with you, Filemon? Don't give her those ideas. Don't worry, dad. I will study hard to take you out of here. It's good you think that way, What Mateo wants are grandchildren, right? No, I'm still as young and strong as an oak. - Julita. Julita... Mateo. - Baby! Baby, what's wrong? Help me out. Help me out. Take her over there. Over here! Where? So you tangled with that filthy girl. I just see her when I'm bored Oh, and after The Simpsons. Be careful, son. I don't want to have any trouble with Mateo. Come on. Don't tell me that moron freaks you out. Don't be a such a jerk! But when you mess with people's pride, they become very dangerous. Ma'am, they told me you wanted to see me. Tell me, how can I help you? You can't help anyone, where the hell have you been? - I was just doing... - Doing what? Tell me! - Say it, God damn it! - What's going on? Why are you yelling at her? You don't talk to people like that. She is an idiot. No. Don't treat her that way. - Martina. - Yes, sir? - Go take care of your duties. - Yes, sir. That was rude. You shouldn't treat people like that. Baby... I have to take you to the doctor. Yes, daddy, I'll go later. Go to work. No, sweetheart, I can't leave you alone. Mateo, stay if you want to. I'll go to work. No. Both of you, go to work. I'm okay. Really, sweetie? Yes, dad. I'll go to the doctor later so you don't have to worry. Fine. - Let's go. - Let's go. Martina, next time you go out let me know. Don't yell at her just because. It's my fault. I told her to do some things and I didn't tell you. Okay. But don't forget, she's my servant. Not yours. Don't worry, ma'am. Next time I need to go out... I will let you know. - Get out. - Excuse me. I really don't get why you make such a big deal about Martina. Were not arguing, son. We just have different points of view. Why the fuck didn't you tell me!? I was going to tell your mom. But I though it better if you knew first. - How long have they been dating? - I don't know. They have been treating your mom like a fool for about 2 years. But recently they have been hiding it less. Recently, they were seen holding hands in the town park. Where was it exactly? In your parent's townhouse. Now it makes sense. The other day he was pissed off when I told him that I liked that bitch. The only problem, Paco, is we're talking about your father here. So what? The fact he is my father, doesn't mean he can't be taught a lesson. So, what's you plan? Paquin... I'm glad you came with us to have some beers. - Why don't you dance? - You dance. - What's his problem? - He has the devil inside. - I told him what we know. - Why did you tell him? He had to know! And you, get out of here. We have a lot to talk about. - Did he give you any orders? - Not yet. But we have to stay alert... Because this kid is capable of anything. Let's stay alert then. - You are in trouble, bastard! - Easy. You killed your sister so you could keep her lands. I couldn't have done it. She's my sister! Sure? These are the deeds to your sister's lands. You killed her to keep her propery! - I can't stand killers! - Juan! Juan! Go get Eladio! What are we going to do now? We have been left alone. I'm going to keep on going. I don't want to put you in danger. Are you suggesting I'm a coward, like Matias? Not at all. But you have a family. Besides... I'm alone! I sent my family to Guadalajara, with my sister. I won't turn my back on them. Eladio... thanks. - You'll see we will overcome this. - Hope so. - Nemesio wants to see you. - We've got nothing to tell him. - Then you'll have to come with me. - Why? Because apparently, you are accused of murder. - What? - Are you insane? - We're not going anywhere - That's what you think. What's wrong? It's because of your daughter, isn't it? Yes, I don't know what's wrong with her. It must be something temporary, calm down. Calm down. How can I be calm if my daughter doesn't feel well? - I don't know what's wrong! - Don't worry. If you're not okay, then who's going to tell us what to do? You know Regina and Rosendo. Come on, let's go. I think you're right. - Martina, you're so hot! - Leave me alone! Don't fucking drink from the bottle! Glasses are made for that. Don't be bad-mannered. Don't you want Martina to be my woman? She is a maid. And what do you think, Dad? I think she is a lady, that's why she has to be respected. Why do you react like that if she is nothing but a maid, as mom says? What? Besides, she is not going anywhere, is she? Of course she's staying. She works here, doesn't she? Why do you always take her side? What do you do with that bitch? Me? Puppies. Excuse me. You know very well that we are innocent! Say whatever you want, man but you won't get away with this. You are a bunch of assholes, but sooner or later you'll pay for it! Yeah, but surely you won't make us pay! That's what I was about to tell them, boss. Oh! How I'd like to be free so I could kill you! You'd better calm down, Eladio, if you don't want to go to the punishment cell with Romualdo! You feel brave because you have a badge and a gun. But open the door and you'll see! - You, prick! - Come on. Open up so "I can see.? You'd better go smoke a cigarette. You moron! Idiot! Here's your punishment, bro: No toilet paper. - Juan, are you okay? - Nemesio wants to kill me. Lend me some money. I need to see the Governor. Don't worry, I'll bring it right away. Thanks. Don Armando, have you heard all the gossiping in the town? - What happened? - Some cops from the capital... are coming to catch Regina and her people. One day that bitch's empire had to come to an end! It all started because they wanted to get Romualdo. Well, they actually caught him. Big problems are coming to town. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. What will you have? The usual. Ribs, please. Hello? What's up? Okay. Hold on. - I'm going to sit over there. - Okay, I'll take it there. Okay. What happened, Julita? Bruno told me to come before your dad. Where is my dad? He is with the vet, checking the livestock. What's wrong? - I'm pregnant. - What? The doctor told me that I fainted because of that. No way, Julita! You are going to be in trouble with your dad. Help me! What shall I do? It's okay. I'll take care of that. You're so kind, Filemon. The question is, what is going to happen to you. Why is that? Some cops from the capital are coming. They're getting Regina's people. And you're one of them. How do you know this? We heard it from Don Simon and Don Santiago. Filemon and Mateo were talking to some cops about someone called... What's his name? Samuel! Fuck! Samuel! I can't touch that fucking Mateo. Boss's orders. But that fucking Filemon will never forget me. Never. What's wrong, Nemesio? Kill them. Do it slowly. They are going to die alone, asshole. Don't let anyone visit them. Got it? Okay. - Julia is pregnant, Paco. - Congratulations! Whoa, whoa! You have to do the right thing. Don't act the fool. I don't know what are you talking about, so quit that bullshit. - Well, Mateo doesn't know it. - I don't care what you both think. And I'll give you some advice: Stop poking your nose into other's business or you can get killed. I'm not afraid of you, I'll give you some advice too: Stop relying on your mommy and daddy's power. - What's your name, sir? - Moises Perez. Well, you're under arrest for public indecency. - Why? - Why? Aren't you embarrassed to be seen making a fool of yourself, pissing in the street? - Hey! What's going on here? - What do you mean? We have to put this drunk man in jail! I'm taking him. No! What's your problem? We have to follow Deputy Samuel's instructions. I don't care about Samuel, I'll take him. - I said no! - What is it now? He wants to take this drunk man and we have to follow the deputy's orders. - Let Pedro lock him up. - But... But nothing! I give the orders here! Do you want to lose your job as a cop? Not over there, idiot! No one goes in there! And you... get out of here! - Are you Filemon Salas? - Salas, fellas, umbrelllas. Who are you? And what the fuck do you want? It's none of your fucking business, moron! You have been fucking disturbing many people. Alright. Then, go. Go away, boys. You look like a beginner. What should I do? That moron threatened me and left me worried. Kill him. Tell Parral and Colorado to get rid of him. I'll talk to that filthy bitch and set her straight. Don't worry. I'll take care of that. Don't be a jerk. You're my son. And I'm your mother. Now go with the guys to fix that problem. THE HACIENDA SNACK BAH Julita! Juli... what? - What happiness? - I love Julita and she loves me. She loves me! It's because of you That I want to live I don't care what people Think about me She loves me, dude! What if we buy you a bottle, so you can keep having fun. - Why would you do that? - Hey, you're just happy. No! No! No! We want to have fun with you, come on. Julia! Julia! Leave me alone, asshole! You killed him, asshole! Brother! Juan! What, asshole? What's your fucking problem? Who is the fucking moron? Who? Who's a moron? Eh? You fucking loudmouth! Leave me alone! This is what's going to happen to you! You son of a bitch! Leave me alone! You killed my brother, you motherfucker! - Fuck you! - I'll teach you a fucking lesson! Shut the fuck up! - What the fuck did you do? - What did I do, asshole? No! Now, fucking piece of shit, you're fucked up! What do you want? I warn you, your father is in danger. Filemon is dead. And if your father finds out about you and my son, he'll be dead, too. - Why do you cover for him? - Because he is my son! When I see you I understand your son's wickedness. Both of you are nothing but buzzards. Now you know it. I think this is very risky, Paco. Life is full of danger, Colorado. This has to look very real. My father must be taught a lesson. I have to say, this seems like a very bad joke. Fuck! Are you going to help me or not? - Yeah. Let's see what happens. - Let's go then! Good morning, sir! Well, not so good - you look like shit! How about drinking a bit of booze instead of a glass of water? I'm talking to you, asshole! I'm talking to you, asshole! Easy, man. Don't you see they can't talk to you? Oh, yeah! That's right. Rosendo, my love! - What are you doing? - Oh, you know! Take it easy, slowly. I thought you said this bitch was very "experienced." Fuck off, asshole! Leave me alone! Let her go, idiot! Don't be disrespectful to me! You can't talk about respect. Leave me the fuck alone! You're a whore... and an abandoned one. What did you do, idiot? What are we going to do with the bodies? Nothing. It could've been anyone... who killed them. He was an asshole, but he was my father. Let's go, commander! It you go in there, they'll kill you! Why? What is it? Samuel, some Ministerial Policemen and a Federal Delegate... came and arrested Pedro, they also took Romualdo and Eladio. Let's go! Fuck! What happened? What happened? Nothing. When I got there, they were dead. Someone must have caught them off guard. That bitch was his lover. Why that face? Do you want to know the real story? What happened? Colorado told me about their affair. I couldn?t stand it, so... I wanted to teach him a lesson, but I went too far. - You killed Rosendo - No. No. I killed Martina. Colorado killed him. Then he killed Parral. I had nothing to do with it. That bastard wasn't your father. You shouldn't shed a tear for him. It's okay. What's wrong, Nemesio? Nothing. lt's just that some federal cops have arrived. - How's that? - How's that? Juan reported it, so they're coming after me. Anyway. I want you to lend me some money to get out of here, and you should do the same. Commander, you're under arrest for corruption and racketeering. Die, motherfuckers! So you had the balls to kill my mom, eh? You're fucked up, man. Sweetie! Why? Why did you get your hands dirty with the blood of those buzzards? They didn't deserve to live, dad.
