- Hi, my name is Ari Gold, I directed "Adventures of Power," the movie you're about to see. If you're wondering why you never heard of it, we made it outside the Hollywood system for almost no money, but fans have been asking for us to bring it back, so thank you. People ask me why I made a movie about air drumming. I think air drumming looks funny, and I hope you do too, but also for me, air drumming in its crazy way gets at a spiritual and maybe even a political truth that is super relevant right now, so I hope it speaks to you. Please stick around until the very end of the credits, to join us in making the world a more beautiful, more awesome, and more powerful place. Now, get ready for "Adventures of Power." [ Heart beating ] The first sound we hear is the beat of our mama's heart. [ Machinery clanking ] [ Train honks, bell dings ] But then the noise of the world drowns out that beat... until we can't hear it anymore. But once in a while a person comes along who holds onto that beat, no matter how hard the world beats back. Imagine that. [ Mr. Mister's "Kyrie" plays ] [singing] Kyrie eleison Kyrie eleison Kyrie eleison My heart is old it holds my memories My body burns a gem-like flame Somewhere between the soul and soft machine Is where I find myself again Kyrie eleison down the road that I must travel Kyrie eleison through the darkness of the night Kyrie eleison where I'm going will you follow? Kyrie eleison on a highway in the night Kyrie eleison down the road that I must travel Kyrie eleison through the darkness of the night [ kids yelling ] Kyrie eleison where I'm going will you follow? Kyrie eleison on a highway in the light [ people arguing through the wall ] [ One Cheerio rattles ] Shoot. [ Doorbell rings ] [ Joanie howling ] [ Door closes ] My aunt's not feeling well. Hello, fellas! Welcome to Youth and Young-At-Heart. What can we do for you today? You got a room? - It's okay, Aunt Joanie. - Oh, I'm sorry, Power. Frank's disability ran out. It's nice outside. Honey, I-I heard that, uh, they cut back pay at the plant again. Your dad's not gonna strike, is he? He doesn't talk to me that much these days. Oh, sweetheart, I'm so sorry, please. Aw. Please, don't listen to my brother when it comes to you, Power, okay? You are a beautiful spirit, and I love that little thing you do. I love your it's it's very cute. It's not cute, Aunt Joanie. People think it's amazing. Okay. Are you sure you don't want something hot to eat there? Joanie. You can always count on cereal. Thanks, honey. [ Bowl clanks, box liner rustles ] When.

[ feedback rings ] So, what's your friend gonna do, touch himself? He's gonna win, lady. Yeah, right, Tonto. [ Scattered applause ] [singing] We walked through the valley, we walked through [ toilet flushes ] Doin' your thing, Power? When are you gonna do somethin'? I ain't touched a guitar in 15 years. Don't matter. Right. Well, rock 'em dead, Power. [ Sneakers squeaking ] Ow! [singing] Present day On the old applause meter, I would say that rated 'bout a six. Next up we have a special speech, followed by Power. Thank you. Thanks for havin' us to Talent Night. Look, uh, I'm not gonna do a big song and dance here. - If this strike does happen... - You tell 'em, Harlan! ...and us boys don't have the cash to buy a cerveza from my hippie sister here, that don't mean that we don't love you. We do. Are we gonna let Dick Houston kill this town after we made Houston Tricorp what it is? No! Are we gonna let Dick Houston cheat our kids... Gonna win this thing! [shatters] Ow! Eight three two! What's up, Power? You gonna rock it, brother? - That's right! - Shut your trap, Bobby. Hey, you gonna watch, Dad? The boys love it. [ Snickers ] They're makin' fun of you, Power. Come on, look at yourself. Gay shoes. Gay jeans. Gay... I actually like the headband. You know, I named you Power so that you'd be strong. I wanted you to be a man, not a pussyfooter. I'm not pussy footing. I'm double bass drumming! Joanie, start the tape! [singing] Nickled and dimed... Overtimed They got you working So you just might lose your mind Ears ringin', your eyes stingin' When payday comes the bossman just robs you blind Whoo-hoo! Power! Freak! [singing] Impossible fantasy Is becoming your destiny So raise your head high You'll rocket to the sky Make your dream your new reality [ song ends; door closes ] You my friend! What? That was amazing! - Whoo! Power! - This place is boring. Let's go. Ladies, wait! Why don't you play real drums, Power? [ Can clattering ] Did you win? What are you doin' here, Dad? My sister makin' you sleep outside again? You know, when I clear some of them papers out of my apartment, I'll have room for another bed. I'm sorry we don't have the house anymore. It's okay, Dad. [ Thunder rumbling ] [ Rain pattering ] Sorry I missed your performance. What? S-sorry I missed your performance. Well, it wasn't a performance, Power. Look, I been workin' for that company since I was 17 years old, and they promised us that if we worked hard and saved up we'd have a decent life, and so would our kids. But now they're rich, and they think they can just throw us out like garbage, so I'm tryin' to tell people they gotta stick together and keep at it before they choke this whole town. That's what I'm doing too! With with this? Well, if you listen to the words of the song That what it's about? The words? Well, no, it's about the drumming. You don't even have any drums. Well, you would never let me. I know it's too late for me to learn to play drums. I can still rock. Power, I love you because you're part of your mother, but you can't keep doin' this to me. You gotta stop. No, you listen to me. It could do you good. You know, like that part in "Tom Sawyer" where Neil Peart goes-- I mean, I can't really do it, but, um-- [ vocalizing ] I mean, you know, it's the feeling, Dad. I-I could bring this feeling to everyone. You know, I did you see tonight? There's gonna be trouble tomorrow. I know. I'm here to help. You stay out of it, Power. I got your back, Dad! [ Country song plays ] [singing] A little like you, I dream about a double-wide I work hard, but still I'm broke A little like you, I salute the flag with pride like I was taught to by my folks You think you know the time A little bit like you, I got problems in my life You think you know my rhyme A little bit like you, I try and try and try And try A little like you Heck of a song, boy. It's good to see you playin' real drums. Real drums is the bomb, dad! Mm. You move that hotel I gave you, boy? - Yep. - Yeah? What about your cologne? - What's it called again? - Sweat. Sweat! We're sellin' buckets. You baggin' fillies right quick? Word up. You know it. So, uh, Pa, remember that crazy thing I used to do? I gave you drums, didn't I? Give you everything you need, right? Yep. No, I know. I-I was just think there's this contest, and... No! You are not gonna start that abomination again, are you, because it's wrong! Nah, dawg! I'm a drummer, Dad. I'm a real drummer now, you know that. I was just kiddin' you. All right. I was just kiddin'. Good. That's good. You make me proud, boy. Go long! Oh! [ laughing ] Yeah! I got it, Pa! [phone rings] Good boy! Chambliss, what's goin' on out there in New Mexico? I've got my eye on them. I wanna know who's causin' trouble. Uh, yep. [ Tires squeal ] [ Thunder crashes ] - Eleven minutes. - Any word? [ "Impossible Fantasy" playing on transistor ] [singing] Impossible fantasy is guiding you fearlessly To that glorious place out in outer space Heads up, Power! [singing] Where your horses run free Stop, Power! Agh! [ Buzzer rings ] What's wrong with him? What makes you think I should tolerate this? It's not gonna happen again. No, it ain't. You're fired, Power. Sorry, Dad. Well, what are you standin' there for? [ Machinery creaks to a standstill ] Oh, shoot. Harlan, don't you do this to me. I didn't want to. Walkout is in progress. Over. See you brothers at the town hall! Mr. Houston is gonna destroy you! We're strikin'! That's right, Power. The workers are strikin'. How can I help? You can't! You're not a striker! Well, yes I am. I'm right here with you. You can't strike if you've been fired, Power! Nice goin', Power! Dad? Come on, man, let's go. [ Train whistle blows ] Yeah, it's time to get a drink.

Ow. - Batalla? - Battle. - De los tambores. - Of drums. None... Drums... Permit? It's an air drum contest in Mexico! Tonight! There's a place for people like me. It's only 40 miles. Take my bike. - I can't just leave everybody. - Power. You've got something special that nobody here understands. Don't waste it. Please. [singing] I was born to run I was born to dream The craziest boy you ever seen I gotta do it my way And we will strike at every single Tricorp plant across this nation until we are heard! [singing] And I was here to please I'm even on my knees Makin' love to whoever I please I gotta do it my way Or no way at all And then you came around Tried to tie me down I was such a clown You had to have it your way Or no way at all I'm gonna pack my bags and fly-y-y-y-y [ bike crashes ] Shoot. [ Kid speaking Spanish ] [ Giggles ] [ Coyote howls ] [ Chickens clucking ] I'm here for the... contest? El es mi amigo. You my friend. [ Squeaking ] [ Men arguing in Spanish ] [ Ranchero music playing ] [ Heavy metal playing ] [man singing in Spanish] Cinco, cuatro, tres, dos, uno. [ Distorted music ] [ Men chattering ] Ohh! [ Clucking ] Dad? [ Rhythmic creaking ] [ Rhythmic beeping ] [ Silence ] [singing on radio] A modern day warrior Mean, mean, stride Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride [ "Tom Sawyer" continues ] [ Rooster crows ] Did I win? Huh? Are you freaking crazy? You tried to play a Rush song without a stool. You would have had a heart attack if that song kept going. You got guts, though, you know? Carlos had his eye on you. Before he split, he gave me this. Who did? The man. You should train with him for the showdown. In the Big Apple! - New York City? - Uh-huh! This says Newark. Ah, same thing. Misma cosa, hombre, no te preocupes. Corre! Corre! Andale! Andale! [singing] It's a mighty hard road that my poor hand has hoed My poor feet has traveled a hot dusty road And out of your dust bowl and westwards we rolled And your desert was hot And your mountains was cold Well, it's always we ramble, that river and I Down along your green valley I will work till I die And this land I'll defend with my life if it be Because my pastures of plenty Must always be free We work in your orchards of peaches and prunes Sleep on the ground 'neath the light of your moon On the edge of your city you will see us and then We come with the dust and we go with the wind "Dear Sid, tell Joanie I love her. "And tell the boys I'm praying for them. "And for my dad too. "I'll send you money for a bike as soon as I can. "I just need to find out why the universe "made want to drum, but never gave me the chance. "But I know things will be different in Newark. Maybe people will understand me there." Welcome to Newark! "They say it's lonely in the big city, but I believe anyone can make a friend." Not the apron, man! Aah! [ Blows landing ] "Love, Power." Hi. I'm Power. [ Sirens wailing ] I just think burning for all eternity would be really poopy for you, Yolanda. Enjoy your food! God's fan club can always use new members. After all, the end is near... Oh, yes, is near, yes, yes. [ Speaks Cantonese ] Oh oh oh oh. Thank you. Those are bad boys. What you doing in this neighborhood? I'm looking for a place called Carlos' Gym. I'm a rock 'n' roll drummer. Rock? Rock is the devil's music, child. - Good-bye. - Goodnight, Fong. Yes, Farrah, yeah. [ Yolanda speaks Cantonese ] What a shame. Time for bed. Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Good. Sinner. Mr. Power, my husband like your name. Can you do mop? I'm a good worker. You sleep here. Flat noodle, lo mein noodle, Power noodle. Hi, I'm Power. Thanks for your help last night. What's your name? Can't you see she's busy? Catch you later. [ Bongo and other types of drums drumming ] Why do we got to do this immigrant stuff, chief? 'Cause, spaghetti-heads like you got no rhythm. Spaghetti-heads? I was born in this country, and I love rock music. Hey, hey, hey! Brain Dog! We have got to be ready for anything. It ain't my fault Señor Towelhead can't play real music! Hi, I'm Power. I'm lookin' for Carlos. You found him. Remember me? Gentlemen, this is Power. Power here tried to survive a hot room fight playing "Tom Sawyer". Imagine that. How much you bench, Power? What? Take off your shirt, chief. Brain Dog, calme. Take it easy, man. Mm! Whoa! You need a tan, dude. You're hurting my eyes. So wear sunglasses. Why are you here, Power? Me, Papa Legba tell me to play. Ernesto, why do you do this? It makes me sexy. Tell him about me. Lal here was kicked outta the Air Sitar Society. - Brain Dog - Shouldn't even be here. You're just like the rest of us. I can play drums! Oh, yeah, yeah, sure you can't. How 'bout you, Power? Hmm? Why are you here? You like drums? Well, I always wanted to play drums. But my... I guess I never got the chance. You know, but then the first time I heard "Tom Sawyer" by Rush, I felt the music flow through me. It felt so good. It felt like the whole world was comin' alive. Then people were like, "What are you doin'?" I don't know. Nobody understands, do they? Well, it's not their fault. Oh, yes, it is. But I don't get it either. There has to be a reason we do this. You bet your sweet ass there is. Go into my office, Power. What? And now you're adding in some waxy wimp from the boonies? Why you outsourcin' Jersey? Brain Dog, we need a low-tom to complete the set. You know that. Suck it up, man. Sit down. Don't worry about Brain Dog. He'll come around. But we got a bigger problem right now, Power. You want to turn that on for me, please? I'm here to talk about my video, "A Little Like You." Who is that? A cowboy, a billionaire, a drummer. Mm. Imagine that. Clips his toenail and it sells on eBay. Now, a drum company is stagin' this air drum fight to promote their product. For them it's just a stunt, but the winnin' crew gets 2K. Now that's real money, and that's our chance to show the world that we are legit. Problem is, this pretty boy just signed up, and he don't even like air drummin'. So how could he win if he doesn't love it? This clown gets applause just for showin' up, accuracy because he plays real drums, and he can last all night, because he does not give his all like my boys do. You know, any fool can play drums. It's easy. But when you have got to bounce your hands off air, when you've got to bounce your hands off the substance of life, down, up, up, down, that is a double workout. You know that, I know that. But these clowns, they wanna make a joke out of us. You know what I'm sayin'? Power, you know how it feels to be laughed at for doin' somethin' that you love? I do. Do you know how it feels to cry in the dark? I do. Do you know how it feels to touch yourself with no hands? Then let's show these bastards that we are better than they are. We're not better, we're just different. No, no, we're better. - Different. - Better. - Different. - We're better! Okay. You used to be a drummer, didn't you? Best funk band in Jersey. Why'd you quit? Are you blind? Slot machine in Atlantic City took my last quarter. And those sissies there, they kicked me outta the band. What they forgot was music is not about having arms. Music is about havin' spirit. And I had the last laugh when Def Leppard just kept on pumpin' out the hits. All right, here's the scoop. If our crew qualifies for the team round, we gotta make one big drum set. Brain Dog's on kick, Aubelin's on crash, Ernesto's keepin' the backbeat. And Lal plays a mean high-hat. Lal may not be as pretty as our cowboy friend there, but he's got lungs like a blue whale. The man is loose, he's flowing, he's strong. With him in it, a real air drummer has a genuine shot at the title. Okay, but where I need you, where I need you at... Power, where I really, really need you is on the low-tom in the team round. All right? It's not a glamorous job, and you only got ten days to train. What do you say, Power, huh? - Low-tom? - Low-tom. [ Single beat of the low-tom] Welcome to the crew. Grab yourself some weights, man. Go get yourself in shape. [ Siren wailing ] [ Judas Priest's "Hell Bent for Leather" plays ] [singing] Seek him here, seek him on the highway Never knowing when he'll appear All await, engines ticking over Hear the roar as they sense the fear Wheels! A glint of steel and a flash of light Screams! From a streak of fire as he str-- Hell bent, hell bent for leather Hell bent, hell bent for leather Sweat. A fragrance by Dallas H. Unleash your inner cowboy. [ Pounding ] Yes? - Where's the potty? - Where's the what? Where's the big, devil potty? The potty? Where are all your party friends? - I'm alone here. - I can't sleep. You're so roud! Are you Chinese? Are you retarded? Do I look Chinese to you? You sound Chinese. I'm deaf, you idiot. Wait. If you can't hear me, how am I keeping you awake? I can feel you. You can? What are you doing in here? Nothing. Show me. Girls don't like it. Show me... or I'll call the police. [ Whispers ] Please like it. [singing] As they try Hell bent, hell bent for leather Hell bent, hell bent for leather Stop! Stop! It's rock music, isn't it? It's evil. - No, it's not. - Why do you do that? It's like my sign language. I thought you'd like it. Well, nobody taught me sign language. What are you saying? I'm saying I love music, and I wish I could play it. I wish I could hear it. Try another song? [ Soft piano music ] I-I can't. I don't know this-- Try it. Show me what it sounds like. [man and woman sing duet in Cantonese] I like this song. Me too. My name is Annie. My name is Power! [singing continues] Power's in love! Power's in love! There you go. Thanks for the turds. They're lentils, Bobby. Full of positive energy. Company can't afford it? Copper's up eighty cents! Hello? They killed two strikers in Peru last year. - What makes you think-- - This ain't Peru. We're gonna win this. Keep it up, brothers! [ Applause, whistles ] Guys! Power sent me a postcard. He should send you a new bike. He says he has a girlfriend, and she's totally deaf. - Deaf? - That means she's hot, dude. He says he's gonna compete in the Air Drum Fight in New York City. The what? That freak. Let me see that. No, I'm not supposed to. Maybe if I'd bought him drums, he'd be over this by now. Harlan. "When you see my dad, don't tell him I wrote. "Just tell him a joke or somethin' so he smiles today. Love, Power." Let me see that. So, Mr. Harlan. How many Navajos does it take to screw in a -- [ honking ] Get a job, losers! Pent-hiz-ouse, yo. Come check out my crib. Oh, yeah. Yo, what's up, yo? Yo, yo, camera guy. Check this out. Boom. [ Cackling ] I taught him that. - Check this out. - Whoa whoa whoa. Yo, what up? See, this is where I do all my dance routines. You know, I get down, And I represent like that. You know? Now this is where the dove of genius flies. That is where I get nice on the drums. Look at that. Isn't she a beauty? [ Horse neighs ] And that, yeah, that's where the magic happens. [singing] Sexy sexy sexy Hey, baby, come here. Come here. Go away. Ha ha ha! I love that. Oh! Hoo hoo! That is that is bad! Dallas, so what is next for Dallas H.? Politics? I got to tell you, I do it all. You know, I got my animated series, got my non-stick cookin' spray. Mm-hmm. I just take life as it comes. Right, right. So what is this rumor I hear, then, about this air drumming competition on Friday night? Where'd you hear about that? - This interview is over. Come on. That's all right, I got what I need. What you lookin' at? Get outta here. Don't touch the shirt, mate. What do you think you're doin', boy? Gentlemen, I know you remember the sound of your mama's heart beating. We are brothers keeping that beat. [ Man singing in Arabic ] Your heart never gets tired of beating. Why should you? Beautiful. Work what you got, baby. Work what you got. Power. Power. What is with the facial tension, man? You are on the low-tom. You are not taking a poo! Hey, kids, can I share something with you? When you're loose, music flows through your heart like blood, but when you're tight, every beat of your heart makes you hurt. Power! Power! See man, that is what almost killed you in Mexico. Let your ass touch the wood. Sit on the stool. Brain Dog! Sorry, chief. People, concentrate! Did we come all this way just to have folks laughin' at us? - No! - All right, then. Now, everybody, full set. Low-tom, sit this one out. Power, you are all over the place. You have got to remember that every drum is different. Low-tom. That's you. I always forget. I just start, you know, feeling the music-- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me see if I can imagine that. Mmm. No, you're not feelin' anything. - Yes, I am! - What are you feelin'? I'm feelin' really proud to be playing low-tom. - Bovine manure! - Okay, fine! I'm feeling frustrated that I came all this way. I thought it'd be different here. I thought I'd be somebody. All right, see, you have got to use that anger, man. That's what I'm talkin' about. You're too tight to play right. What's that supposed to mean? That means you're just a low-tom. Low-toms are important too. Tight ones? What's wrong with Power? He too tight to play right. [ Speaks Cantonese ] Take off your shorts. I thought you a good Christian girl. I am, Mr. Fong. Take them off. [ Speaks Cantonese ] [ Banging ] Shoot! Power, I have an idea. I can't wear those, Annie. It'll make you feel free. Oh, you think my drumming's tight, too? Well, maybe if you loosened up, then the music would really show. What do you know about music? [ Slams door ] [ Dazz Band's "Let It Whip" plays ] Your legs. So right. So white! Like white tiger. [singing] I wanna see you with it Sho' could treat you right Give me just a minute of your time tonight We both are here to have the fun So let it whip - Let's whip it, baby - Child - Let's whip it right - Let it whip Let's whip it, baby Whip it all night - So what's your trip? - No, no Child, come on, let it whip Come on, whip come on [ yelling ] There's no time to lose There is no time to lose I sense something divine in you Something divine in you Yes, I do - Oooh-hoo-hoo - So let it whip Let's whip it baby - Child - Let's whip it right - Let it whip - Let's whip it, baby - Whip it all night - Well, what's your trip Oh, no, child - Come on, let it whip - Come on, whip - Come on, whip - So let it whip - Let's whip it, baby - Child - Let's whip it right - Get a grip Let's whip it, baby Whip it all night [ shutter clicking ] Speed, accuracy, and flair. This is how I will beat the cowboy thrice over. That's it. What are you wearin'? I'm loose. You're gonna make us look like a bunch of pansies. Put on some pants. Hey, you put pants on your head. Shut up, Jihad Boy. I'm sick of you people. Stop behaving like kids, okay? He started it! [ door opens ] Oh... [ muttering in Urdu] What is with you people? We have a fight tomorrow, guys. Lal, get back here. Come on, guys. Everybody huddle up. Men, look at me. Jersey born and raised, so I am a natural Jersey boy. But Lal is a Jersey boy now, too, Brain Dog. And so is Power. No matter what he's wearin'. And so is everybody who's ever lived on a prayer. [ Organ plays ] They call New Jersey the armpit of the nation, but that is not an insult, gentlemen. Without an armpit, we couldn't sweat. Without an armpit, we couldn't work. Without an armpit, we'd be buyin' rock 'n' roll from the Chinese. - I love my armpit! - Yes! Well, all right then. Men, we've got one chance to be a team, or to be nothing, forever. Break! I'm so sorry about the shorts. I should have believed Shh. It would break my mother's heart if she saw me with... a hard rocker. Why, because it's the devil's music? Because I'm all she has. [ Door closes ] I'm glad you landed in Newark, Power. Me too. I'm not wasting what I got anymore. I wish there was something special that I could do. Annie, you are special. You actually feel things. The rest of the world just plays along. Not everybody, Power. You play with passion. That's because melodic rock saved my life. Rush, Styx, Journey... I wish I could show you how beautiful it is to me. I wish you could, too. You have the thin yet supple lips of Steve Perry. You have the golden locks of David Lee Roth. What is this? You rockers are all the same. Sorry, Power. I'll never let him hurt you again. We're leaving this place. Wait! We're taking our mission to Florida tomorrow, so tough cookies. Annie! You'll never see her again! Please don't do this! Farrah! I need her! Why? Because... she feels me. Sex is a sacred package only to be opened in marriage! I didn't open the package! Oh! Annie! I'm going to call the police! You can't keep her to yourself. You have to let her rock! Police! Oh, Annie, no. - No! - Take it, Power. Any girls want lovin' tonight? [singing] Rock 'n' roll is outta sight! [ Guitar riffing ] [ Volume increases, amplifier feedback ] [ Pop; silence ] What band? Styx. Cool! I mean, oh. It was rock 'n' roll that hurt me. Good-bye, Power. [ Screaming ] [ Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" plays ] Bless my sister and my roving son, and all of my brave brothers and sisters in their fight against oppression and greed. Amen. [singing] I can feel it coming in the air tonight [ howling ] Oh, Lord And I've been waiting for this moment For all my life Oh, Lord Can you feel it Coming in the air tonight Oh, Lord [ coyote howls ] Well, if you told me you were drowning I would not lend a hand I've seen your face before, my friend But I don't know if you know who I am Well, I was there And I saw what you did I saw it with my own two eyes So you can wipe off that grin I know where you've been It's all been a pack of lies Men, tonight we have a chance to say something to the world... and as a team, we can win. I don't care how much money the opposition has, how popular they are, how good-looking. Tonight, we are air drummers. Every one of us. [singing] Oh, lord Oh, lord Imagine that. Harlan, I need my paycheck. All we're askin' of Houston is that he keep his promises. How 'bout the union keepin' its promises? We can't feed our kids on nothing. Just hold out another couple of days, and Houston'll come to the table with Some poor slobs here from Mexico to take our jobs. You ain't crossin' this line, scabs! Get your families home. Those aren't scabs. Get on your bike and get outta here. Go home! Let me handle this. [singing] You don't fool me The hurt doesn't show But the pain still grows It's no stranger to you and me [ drum riff ] I can feel it coming in the air tonight Oh, Lord And I've been waiting for this moment For all my life Oh, Lord I can feel it in the air tonight Oh, Lord And I've been waiting for this moment For all my life Oh, Lord I can feel it coming in the air tonight Oh, Lord And I've been waiting for this moment All my life Oh, Lord I can feel it in the air tonight, oh, Lord That one! [singing] Oh, Lord Well, I've been waiting for this moment Yeah! That wraps up a tasty block of Collins. And now on the news, the stock market spiked up today, with word from Tricorp CEO Dick Houston that a nationwide copper strike that started in New Mexico may soon be over. The strike leader is in critical condition and others hospitalized today after they viciously attacked Tricorp company peacemakers. Carlos, do you have a phone? Power, stay focused. Whoa. Pow, you look pale, man. As usual. I'll take care of that. I need to call my family! Ow, what are you doing? What the--We almost to the tunnel to New York City. - I'll be right back! - Easy, Power. - Hey, hey, ow! - Don't do that. [ Honking ] Ow! - Where you going, man? - Sorry. He bit me. You got to be kiddin' me. I knew that pussy... was a pussy. Hey! Shut up. You're starting to piss off. Operator? [ Rings ] Hello? Aunt Joanie? It's Power. Hold on. Harlan? Hmm? It's Power. [ Clears throat ] Hello? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left. I should have been there. No, I'm sorry, Power. I never could afford to raise you and watch out for you and buy you drums. Forget drums. I just wanted to be like you. Don't you get it? I wanted you to be better. They beat us today. They beat us with sticks. We didn't have sticks. But we had spirit, just like you. These boys are down for the count, but we felt something today. Something in us could change. They need you. Lode needs you. I need you. I love you, Dad. I'm right there with you. Now I got a job to do. I know you do, son, so do it. [line clicks] Couple of months? I can't handle that. What can you do? This is real. Hey, how do I get back to the tunnel? The tunnel? I need to get to New York City. Good luck! [ laughing ] Copper Local 832, Lode, New Mexico. You're Power. You're supposed to be in New York already. How'd you know? Local 185. We heard about what happened. We're prayin' for your Pa and the boys. Yeah, we're prayin' they don't quit. - They don't quit. - Get in the boat, brother. [ Boat horn blows ] [ Applause, cheering ] Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness the new breed of warrior-- those who have been called by heaven to play... no drums. [ Cheering ] And you should all feel privileged to watch the most dedicated air drummers in the world compete for a huge cash prize of $2,000! [ Scoffs ] What's goin' on out there with those troublemakers? We won this thing. We offer them eight an hour and we're done with it. That's the way I want to hear you talk, boy. These guys don't have the guts to picket anymore. We took care of that. Hey. Come on in. - In the qualifying round... - There it is! Each drummer will fight to collect applause points for their crew. They will also be monitored by the Bakir Cymbal Drum Matching Machine. To the death! [ Grunge song plays ] [ Bell dings ] [ Jazz trumpet piece plays ] [ Heavy metal plays ] [singing] I got show tunes Nothing but show tunes [ horn toots ] [ Rapid drumming plays ] [ Cheering ] [ Dinging ] [singing] There ain't no one like... [ hip-hop beat plays ] [ Nondescript music with cymbals plays ] [ Haitian beat plays ] [singing] And you see her on the dance floor [ harmonica riff plays ] [singing] Metrosexuality! Keep your eyes on the prize, Lal. We'll be all right without him. Stupid! [ honking ] [singing] That's what they want Etcetera, etcetera That performance sucked my will to live. And here he is, ladies, the most eligible bachelor in the U.S.A., pop star, fashion designer, and also baby animal activist, Dallas H.! [ Slow, funky pop plays ] That jerk is playing my song. They mean Dallas Houston? Oh! [singing] Baby! I need your lovin' tonight! [ Dinging ] Baby [ cheering ] Forget the cowboy. He's nothing. He makes good cologne. [singing] Wanna get to my bed with the sheets of lace and silk Soft pillows, champagne on ice Ooo! Hey, hey, hey! We're sold out-- - Got that for you. - Thanks. [singing] Let's undress and caress, makin' love till we feel get our fill. Let's be together, forever. [ Dinging ] And Dallas is the one to beat as we go into the team round. Power! Backstage. Where's Power? What the hell? In third position, Olympia Crew. In second position, Jersey Krew! Yes! We're in! And in the lead, Team Dallas H.! [ Cheering ] Thanks for gracing us with your presence. We made it to the group round. That's what counts. In the group round, crews must play as a single drum set, and then each crew will send its star drummer to survive our challenge song, face to face and to the death! [ Gong rings ] There, there. Yes. Good. Yes. [ Whack ] Oh. This is, uh, from Power. Mom... I can't go to Florida. I know, honey. Maybe Jesus is a rocker, too. [singing] C30, C60, C90, go C30, C60, C90, go C3-0, C6-0 C30, C60, C90, go C90 go for yo 6-0 go! [ Fuzz guitar plays ] What counts now is that we stay strong this round, make up some lost points. Lal's gonna kill in the endurance round, all right? Let's see how the girls are playing it. Break! [ "C30 C60 C90" continues ] Lal, don't burn all your energy. You're gonna need it for the endurance round. Just hold on to second position. Hey. Come here. Go away. [ laughing ] Power, where you goin'? Every time. Hey, you think what we do is a joke. What do you want, freak? I just want you to play hard. Respect what we're doing. I respect music. I actually play the drums. Yeah, well, real drums are fine too, but not everybody has 'em. There wouldn't even be cymbals if it weren't for my family? What do you mean? My daddy mines copper. So does mine. Up next is the Dallas Crew. Girls, I want to hear some screaming! [ Country intro plays ] [ Cheering ] [singing] A little like you, dreamin' 'bout a double-wide I work hard, but still I'm broke A little like you, I salute the flag with pride Like I was taught to by my folks [ remix plays ] You think you know the time A little bit like you, I got problems in my life You think you know my rhyme A little bit like you, I try and try and try And try A little like you Whoo-hoo! [ Cheering ] [ Dinging ] I think it's safe to say that Dallas's Crew will be sending its leader into the endurance round with a heck of an advantage. And there's only one more team to go, the Jersey Krew, who is trying to hold on to second position. Okay, guys, they're not the only ones with tricks up their sleeves. Go, go, go! Let's hear it for the boys from the bridge and tunnel! [ Springsteen-style rock plays ] [singing] At the pier we met him squarely Hit him twice for every shot It's no jive to stay alive But we gave 'em all we got New Jersey nights Make it all right Hit it! [ Indian drumming takes over ] [ Cheering ] [ Dinging ] [ Crowd roars ] [ Buzzer rings ] Oh, my gosh! A penalty! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean? Penalty, my ass! Mr. Lal of the Jersey Krew has been disqualified! - Oh! - What? You can't disqualify my best man! This is an air drum contest, not an air tablas contest. Hand drumming is not air drumming! This is un-American! Lal can drum however he wants. He's a Jersey boy now! Brain Dog, easy. You're our pinch hitter now. Let me handle this. This is drum racism! Brain Dog! Brain Dog! [ Screams ] Nobody disqualifies-- Jersey! Do not touch my patented meter! Regroup! You are touching my patented meter! You are disqualified! Oh, there is blood coming out of my nostril. A tissue please. Oh my god, I'm bleeding! The crowd is going wild! Power! It's all you, Power! You gotta represent for the armpit! You gotta represent for Jersey! The leader of the Jersey Krew has been disqualified for using no air sticks. Three other members of the group have been eliminated for touching my sweet patented meter. This leaves one low-ranking member to compete. He is at a huge disadvantage! Sweat... [ grumbling ] A fragrance by Dallas H. Unleash your inner cowboy. Shut your trap. [ Static ] Bobby! [ Mutes television ] [ Horse neighs ] [ Phone ringing ] Get me my boy. Hang up the phone, Dallas. I gotta break. What? Get me my boy! I give you hit songs. I give you hotels. I give you the best genetic code in history, and you go and humiliate our family. I'm just showin' everybody what a bunch of losers air drummers are. You can't fool me. Don't you get it? I can do whatever I want. The world loves me. They hate you. - So what? - So what is... Maybe this is who I really am. What have they done to my boy? All right, Dallas. If this is who you really are, you listen to me. A Houston doesn't lose. You hear me? A Houston doesn't lose! Don't worry, Daddy-o. It's in the bag. Come on, guys, it's not over. We got one round left. Power can't catch Dallas's score. It's impossible. He's got to outlast Dallas by half a stick. And Dallas barely moves his arms. Welcome back. And welcome to the final round, where the hardest song in history will be played. No--no, you had it. As long as the contestants play correctly, the sticks will light up towards victory! Given Dallas's great advantage at this point, the other competitors will have to outlast him by at least 20 seconds to win, which is no easy feat, because this song destroys drummers instantly! All right, listen to me. I want you to sit square on the stool. Do not waste your energy, okay? And breathe, Power, breathe. I don't want you dying on me. Carlos, I can't go 20 seconds longer than him. Maybe not, but you can earn us some respect out there. Now, listen, we don't know what they're gonna play, but whatever it is, it's not gonna be easy. But I know you. You're loose now, so use it. But low-tom is pretty tight. Yeah. But cymbals shake and sway, and they give off a golden sound. You gotta be the whole set now, Power. The whole set. - Carlos. - Yeah? Thank you. Get out there. Murder 'em! What's wrong, Power? I can't find my stool. [ Audience laughing ] [ Drum roll plays ] Well, now you're gettin' something. Yeah! Come on, Power! [ Whistle blows ] It's Neil Peart! Those bastards! He'll never survive. [singing] Mean, mean, stride Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride Though his mind is not for rent Don't put him down as arrogant His reserve, a quiet defense Riding out the day's events The river [ coughs ] What you say about his company She's out! She's out! [singing] Is what you say about society Catch the mist Catch the myth Catch the mystery Catch the drift Use the break, Power! Save your strength! [singing] The world is love and life are deep Maybe as his skies are wide [ groans ] [ Mr. Mister's "Kyrie" playing in Power's head ] [ Slow motion ] Stop the fight! Kill! [singing] Kyrie eleison Kyrie eleison Come on. Come on, Power. [ Instrumental bridge of "Tom Sawyer" playing ] No, no, no, Power! Nobody's legs can stand that kind of heat! Aaah! Power has to survive another 20 seconds! [singing] No, his mind is not for rent To any god or government Always hopeful, yet discontent He knows changes aren't permanent But change is [ screaming, cheering ] Yes! You my friend! [ Electricity sizzles, bulbs shatter ] [ Heart beating ] Hey, you! You never even played drums, did you? I don't need drums. I am drums. [ Chuckling ] Wow. Neil Peart! Great job, Power. Hi, Neil. Uh, Mr. Peart? Neil. What would you like to do with your half? It's not much, but make my half out to Copper Workers Local 832, Lode, New Mexico. If Power can do it, we can too! All right, let's get back on that line! Uh, sir, I-I think I have some bad news. [ Glass shatters] We are Power! Yeah! Whoo! Imagine that. [ Rock instrumental plays ] [ New song plays ] [singing] On a New Jersey night The boys went looking for a fight From the Bay, from Cape May All the way up L.B.I. Paulie brought his best old switchblade Timmy packed, 'cause he was tight Brothers strike on the Pike From Secaucus to Seabright We weren't asking for nothing More than what we got It wasn't a lot No, but if they try to take Our one little piece away We'll give 'em everything our fists can give 'em! New Jersey nights Those New Jersey nights Yeah, they make it all all right [ new song plays ] [singing] You've been working hard All across the land But soon'll come a day You'll take your stand Down in the pit It's dry and hot But up in the sky You'll be a cosmonaut Yes, you're spreadin' those wings And you're learnin' to fly Well, you can't succeed If you don't try Yes, you're working hard Lord knows they work you to the bone And they bring you down When you get home You got a master plan Nobody understands And I know you'll find a way To make a brighter day That impossible fantasy Is guiding me fearlessly To a glorious place out in outer space Where your dreams run free Impossible fantasy Is becoming your destiny So raise your head high You'll rocket to the sky And remake the astronomy They said "impossible fantasy" But now the whole world is cheering me To a glorious place out in deepest space Since we've made Our dream reality! - Hello, you're still here, thank you.
