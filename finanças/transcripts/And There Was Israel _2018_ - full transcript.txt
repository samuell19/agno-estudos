And there was Israel... The real Jews, the real Judaism, the real mass organization, were against Zionism. On the 80 German Chief Rabbis, 78 signed to say they didn’t want a Zionist anti-Jewish Congress to happen in Germany. The poor Herzl had to organize the congress in a casino in Basle. With all the respect, a casino in Basle everything started from a casino in Basle. This brings us back to Judeo-Christian mythology, to strong and very evocative images, at least in Europe and Northern America: As one opposes a sedentary Jewish farmer to the nomadic tribal Arab. So one opposes the civilized world to barbarians and a primitive world. And this brings us to the stereotypes of Abel and Cain. Abel, the sedentary farmer, and Cain, the nomad, who will be killing Abel. This is perhaps what is most important. How to transform a religious mythology into a historical or political-historical mythology? Why am I insisting here? In Israel’s Declaration of Independence in 1948 they introduce the myth in which the Jewish People was exiled by the Romans during the 1st century of our era. So I decided to look for research reports on this act of exile. But there was no exile, there was no political act of exile. The Jews were not exiled. Judaism had started to spread, to come to Rome etc., but the Jews were never exiled from this land. However, the birth of Zionism needed this idea of return, based on the concept of exile. The crystallization of nationalism with a racist imagination is typical of the end of the 19th century. Everyone went crazy about nationalism at that time, which will later lead to World War 1. One cannot understand WW1 without the idea of nationalism which is spread everywhere. You cannot understand Zionism... it is also an imitation of every other form of nationalism in Europe. During WW1, Britain and its allies are going to fight on different battlefields, in particular on the Arab peninsula, the Middle East. In order to uphold their imperialist goals, the British used diverse strategies and several palace intrigues, and made three contradictory promises. First, the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence: in exchange for their alliance with the British Empire, the Hashemite would receive a soon-to-be Arabic realm, undefined, at the end of WW1. The second secret negotiations were the famous Sykes-Picot Agreement concerning a temporary division of areas of influence in the Middle East between France and England after the war. Lastly, the Balfour Declaration in which the Foreign Secretary, Lord Balfour, declares Britain’s support to the creation of a Jewish national home. Now, very important: the other countries, the other imperialistic or colonialist powers, supported this project in order to have a role in the Middle East changes. One must think like someone in 1917: the Middle East will soon become a land in the hands of Westerners. From a legal point of view, the declaration only committed Britain and no one else from the Allies. We’ll have to wait for 1922 for the Balfour Declaration to be integrated into the charter of the Mandate for Palestine and to become a piece of international legislation. The League of Nations At the end of WW1, the creation of the League of Nations is a great project of hope and will to promote peace. The League of Nations brings, at least, two very important and new approaches. The first focuses on the matter of transparency, on stopping the practices that prevailed in treaties and international agreements until then. The second very important element is the matter of self-determination of free peoples. And this will have consequences, especially on the development of the British Mandate of Palestine and of its outcomes. One has to understand one thing with this Zionist process. Between 1880 up to 1924, there are 2.5 million Jews, especially the Yiddish people, that are immigrating towards the West. They stop in Germany, they are pushed further on; they stop in France and they are pushed further on; they stop in London and they are pushed further on, so they end up in San Francisco. On 2.5 million people, only 100'000 people decided to immigrate to Palestine. The number of Zionists among the Jews is very low. Now, why 1924? Because in 1924 there is a very strong anti-Jewish and anti-immigration resentment in the US. And there is the Johnson law that decides to cut off immigration. Therefore immigration and colonization increase here, in this land of Palestine. So everything is going to be transformed from 1933 because of Hitler’s rise to power, which engages this time a relatively massive immigration, about 40’000 or 50’000 people each year, towards Palestine. And here, you have the feeling that the numerical ratio of people is radically changing in favor of the Zionist movement. In Palestine, the situation remains extremely tense. Serious disturbances are occurring in many areas of the territory and the number of terrorist attacks is increasing. Sent in emergency to restore peace, new British forces have landed in Jaffa. Confronted with the need of stopping the bloody activity of the rebels, the British authority was forced to use strong measures. In 1938, between 15 to 20% of the British army in the world is in Palestine to stop the Palestinian revolt. This means that at the time of the Munich Agreement, 1 British soldier out of 5 is in Palestine, which is totally unacceptable. And when Europe starts moving towards the war, the British freeze the situation in Palestine through the White Paper of 1939 which limits and then forbids the Jewish immigration into Palestine. England and the Mediterranean The freedom of the Mediterranean is essential for the security of the maritime route that links Britain to its colonial Empire. In the Eastern Mediterranean, England has to defend the Palestinian coast and the populations placed under its protectorate, as well as the port of Haifa, the terminus for the pipeline that brings from Mosul the oil needed for its national defense. From 1941 to 1943, Palestine is a rear base for the British army in the Middle East and develops its economy in every sector, because they had to feed and dress 1 million British soldiers that were fighting in the Egyptian desert. Obviously this is also the case in Egypt, in Iraq, the whole region is working for the British army. Then, in spring 1942, the Germans and the Italians were chased from North Africa with the seizure of Tunis. Then WW2 pulls away from the Middle East. And here again, you have distinct attitudes among the Zionist movements. The official Zionism continues to collaborate with the British by eventually creating a Jewish squad that would fight alongside the British army. But in 1944 the Zionist Right starts a series of terrorist attacks against the British in Palestine. So the official Zionism collaborates and takes parts in the war effort against the Nazi Germany, but the Irgun is blocking thousands of British soldiers in Palestine, which were supposed to be fighting against the Nazis. The Irgun does not disarm. Here are the images taken seven minutes after the attack of the Goldsmith of Jerusalem in which 30 British perished. Acknowledging attacks of all sorts – 48 in this month – the British authorities declared martial law in the 5 most populated areas of Jewish Palestine. The brand new United Nations Organization is going to take over the Palestinian problem. The UNSCOP is going to make 2 propositions. The first is for a single State, a Federal State composed of several districts, such as Arab-Palestinian districts and Jewish ones. This proposition won’t obtain the majority of the votes. Whereas the second proposition, presented as the solution, voted by the majority, is precisely the creation of two States. One Palestinian and one Jewish, on a majority of the historic Palestinian territory, and 1% of this territory is dedicated to Jerusalem and its conurbation with Bethlehem under an international status. Among all those who approved the division of Palestine into two independent States, none ever really wanted to tackle the legal or juridical side of the question. In the way it was prepared and conceived, by the intrigues made around it, and by the contrivance that are blindingly obvious and that served to present it to the public opinion as a humanitarian-only project; this project will remain the biggest political scandal of the century. When one examines the votes at the UN, the divide is very clear between those favorable to the Jewish State, generally the Christian countries, and those that refuse it, the non-Christian countries except for some countries from South America that are opposed to the division. I think the decision of 1947 resulted from a guilty conscience. Between 1945 and 1948, every Westerner has two things weighting on his conscience: First, the suffering of the Jews during WW2 was atrocious, that’s one thing. And secondly, what were we to do with all these refugees from Poland, Hungary, and elsewhere, that are in camps in Germany? The US don’t want them in their country, neither do France, nor Great Britain. Joy of Israel In Jerusalem, the Israelites give free rein to their legitimate joy. They celebrate with exuberance the decision taken by the UN to divide Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state. Without satisfying entirely the aspirations of Zionist leaders, this solution constitutes nevertheless for the Jewish people an indisputable success. The situation in Palestine suddenly deteriorated. The Arab population reacted violently to the UN decision to divide Palestine between the Jews and the Arabs. Immediately incidents broke out and fires devastated the Jewish neighborhoods of Jerusalem. In Jerusalem, the tensions between Arabs and Jews increase every day. The Semiramis Hotel, headquarters of the Arab Forces, has been dynamited by members of the Jewish terrorist group, Haganah. Insecurity prevails. In the Jewish districts, every town tries hard to ensure its own defense and every village, in fact every farm, transforms its inhabitant, men or women, in potential fighters. Arabs and Jews enlisted terror and hatred. So we have a myriad of events, situations differ depending on the regions and periods in Palestine. So it is very difficult to say whether or not there was a coordinated expulsion policy. We can debate about the conditions of expulsion, but it is undeniable that from the very beginning, returning was forbidden. So the coordinated and voluntary policy decided by the Israeli Government of that time, was to dynamite villages, burn harvests, shoot on sight anyone trying to return. Crossing Amman, the Transjordan capital, the Iraqi armies are setting off to help their race brother grappling with the Jews. The Transjordan army has crossed the Jordan and has seen dawn break on the horizon of the fortifications of Jerusalem. In Palestine, Arabs and Jews started fighting again. Despite the intervention of the Egyptian Air Force, the Israeli forces have managed to occupy the main points of reference of the Negev Desert in Southern Palestine, including Beersheba, located on the road to Egypt and Jerusalem. Once again the pitiable spectacle of the war ends up on this land that was once the center of men’s great hope. And the world is looking in vain for a reasonable solution to the Palestinian problem. It’s through the writing of the history of this war and its consequences, and also the memoirs that the official story has often dismissed, that a common ground must be found. A part of the conflict’s resolution resides in the negotiation of this relation with the past, of this history and of these memoirs, a fine-tuned combination of what to remember and what to forget.
