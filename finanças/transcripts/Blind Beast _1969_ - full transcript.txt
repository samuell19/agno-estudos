BLIND BEAST Produced by Kazumasa Nakano Original Story by Edogawa Rampo Screenplay by Ishio Shirasaka Photography by Setsuo Kobayashi Recording by Takeo Suda Lighting by Nagaharu Watanabe The Cast Eiji Funakoshi Mako Midori Noriko Sengoku Directed by Yasuzo Masumura My name is Aki Shima. I was never very popular as a fashion model. But I was very moved by the artistic sense of the photographer, Mr. Yamana. And quite willing to let him take such pictures of me. The exhibition created quite a sensation. I went to the gallery one morning for an early meeting. To discuss our next project. At such an early hour, there was only one visitor. He didn't take any notice of the photographs. He was crouched at the foot of the featured statue. It was a nude study of me. It was sculpted by one of Mr. Yamana's friends. His whole demeanor was very strange. What happened next was unexpected. It felt as if the statue and my body were somehow one. I felt his hands as he pawed the statue. It felt as if he was running them over my body. It sent shivers down my back. I ran out of the gallery. Several days later I worked for Yamana again. I woke up at 4 in the morning and drove down to the studio. Yamana was very demanding, working for him was hard. I was exhausted, but I still had to drive back to my apartment in Tokyo. Once home, I called a local masseur to relieve my fatigue. It's open. Come in. I'm from Sakura Massage. They've never sent you before. That's correct. Your normal masseur is otherwise occupied. They sent me instead. Do you mind? I guess not. I only moved here three days ago. I beg your pardon. Hurry up and start. If you don't mind. Give it some muscle. I like it hard. If it doesn't hurt, it doesn't satisfy me. Like this? Harder than that. Your body is quite stiff. Massage is good for younger women, too. It stimulates the circulation so you look better. More so for someone in your line of work. How do you know what I do? You're Aki Shima. Famous for those sensational photos. And very famous among we masseurs. Sometimes I really appreciate my work. I get to talk to famous people like you. And besides, I get to touch you. I'm not famous. You're very beautiful. Flattery. I am not that pretty. To the blind, faces don't really matter. It's your body and the silkiness of your skin. You really are exceptional. Stop that! What the hell? I'm very sorry. The blind have eyes in our fingertips. I know your body better than someone with eyes. From top to bottom. The feel of the blind man's fingers on me, was exactly like the man stroking the statue. Could it be him? Perhaps cold clay wasn't enough. The thought of that made me angry. I said no! Don't you get it? I'm sorry. That's enough. Leave now. But I've just started. Forget it. I'm very tired, I'm not feeling well. I'll pay you anyway. 700 yen, isn't it? What are you doing? It was you! I knew it. - Well done. - My coat. So, you're finally awake. You? Where are you? Where? I'm here. Where am I? What is this place? This is my studio. Your studio? Just like a warehouse from outside. What are you? I'm an amateur sculptor. A sculptor? I'm blind. From birth, damaged optic nerves. I'm totally blind. Being blind is miserable. From listening to people and Braille books, I can picture much of the world's beauty. The sunlight, the color of clouds, splendid scenery and the beauty of works of art. Plays, movies, even TV. But I cannot see a thing. I hate my parents for this. But that doesn't achieve a single thing. All that is left for the blind is sound, smell, taste and our sense of touch. Sounds are like wind, no satisfaction. Smells are useless. Our noses aren't sensitive like dogs. Food merely fills our bellies. But what I have discovered is that touch is the only way to amuse us. Our one tactile satisfaction. Touch, the only sense worth anything to me. I've touched everything I could. I liked the feeling of touching animals best. They're so warm and soft. I've had dogs and cats to stroke. I went to a farm to play with sheep and horses. But no animal can compare with human flesh. Especially the feel of women's bodies. After finishing school, I took a course in massage. Every night I went to inns, hotels and apartments to work. But not for the money. I wanted to feel the women's skin. Like faces, every skin is different. Each with its own shape and feel. So many women, I became totally fixated. Around then, I sold some land I'd inherited from my father. I made a fortune out of it. But a blind man like me could find no use for money. So I bought this warehouse and took up sculpture. Recalling all of the women, I reproduced their body parts from memory. Now I can caress them at any time. It took six years to build the studio. I spent most of my inheritance. When finally completed, I was so happy. Now I spend most of my time here. Days and nights here in the darkness. Amusing myself by caressing their bodies at will. Be careful. I'll put the lights on. This is my studio. What do you think? You're insane. But I soon got bored with it. Real bodies are not like this. The soft bodies of beautiful women with luscious skin. When I finally realized that's what I needed, I heard schoolboys talking about you. What did they say? They were discussing your photos and statue. I went to the exhibition and ran my hands over the sculpture. I registered at your massage agency and finally got to fondle you. Those boys were right. Your body is the finest I've ever known. Your shape, skin texture are exactly what I want. Stay away! Don't worry. I'd never hurt you. What are you planning? Stay for a while and be a model for my sculpture. So you kidnapped me? I had no choice. You would never have agreed. Will you be my model? No! Not a chance in hell. I'll pay very generously. I don't want money. If you do, I'll create a work of art. There are many kinds of art in our world. Art for amusing the eye, the ear and the mind. Why can't touching be an art form? That's not my problem. Every day we use touch. We touch bowls, vases, desks and chairs. Clothes and furs, too. Art is more than color and shape, what about touch? What about it? I want to pioneer the art of touching. Where only the blind can appreciate it. A new art form, by and for the blind. That is my life's mission. I beg you, please be my model. No way! Go on, beat me, kick me. I'll be your slave. You can do anything to me. Just let me touch you. Help me create a totally new genre of art. You're wasting your time. Why, you ask? You stripped naked for that photographer! So why not for me? That's obvious. Mr. Yamana is a great artist. He depicted me as the New Woman of our Age. That's why I posed for him. But I also create art. That's crap and you're crazy. You just want to feel me up. - Why say that? - No, I said. In that case... ...but I won't give up. I'll wait no matter how long it takes. I won't let you go until you agree. You'll lock me up here? Go ahead. The police will find me all the sooner. No, they won't. Why not? I used a false identity when I registered as a masseur. Nobody saw us bringing you here. And besides, we changed taxis many times. We walked the last few blocks. Even a massive search wouldn't find you. You're insane! You can't open it. It's locked. Help! Somebody help me. No use. They're double doors of sheet iron. It's useless to even try. I can follow your scent, the sound of your breath. I'll soon find you. If you keep this up, you'll collapse from exhaustion. Looks like I've got you. Stop it right now, or you'll regret it. You've got goose bumps. Why are you so scared? Let me go! It's inevitable. You give me no choice. Enjoy your breakfast? She didn't touch a single thing. If you don't eat, you'll get sick. I want to talk. Come sit here. Talk about what? I sat up all night thinking about my position. If you continue to lock me up here, I won't be able to eat or sleep. I'll go insane and I'll die. So? I'll do as you say, I'll be your model. Are you sure? But once it's finished, you'll let me go, right? Naturally. After thinking about it I realized that the art of touching is really quite an interesting concept. A bold experiment. It didn't take long to change your mind. I was so scared I could hardly think. In these circumstances, I think anybody would. But once I calmed down, I suddenly realized you're not insane at all. You're a pioneer artist in a brand new genre. You really think so? The energy and passion you've shown in building this studio, proves you're truly unique. I want to work with you to pioneer the art of touching. I'm so pleased you finally understand, thank you. Let's start right away. I want your best work. Excellent. You're one in a million. I searched long and hard for a body such as yours. I love this body. Can I take a break? We've barely started. But I don't feel well. What's wrong? My stomach really hurts. Where? Where does it hurt? You won't call a doctor, will you? No, of course not. I caught a chill, I'll just have to bear it. Shall I turn up the heat for you? Do you have any painkillers? Aspirin, anything. I'll go and look. If not, can you buy me some? I want to get well and get back to modeling. I understand. Where are you going? Let go of me! Michio, she's trying to escape. Was she really trying to escape, Mother? If I'd been any later, she'd be long gone. Is that right? So you lied to me with your fancy stories. Let me go, please let me go! You won't leave until Michio finishes his work. No! I'll go crazy! Let me out! Let me go! Shut up, will you. I'll keep watch over her. You concentrate on your art, it's your only pleasure in life. Thank you. I couldn't do anything without you, Mother. Don't be silly. You know I'd do anything for you. I'm your mother, of course I will. Now get back to work. How long will it take you to finish it? This will be the pinnacle of my art, so I can't really say. If that's the case, maybe we should try to be friends. If not, this oppressive atmosphere will drive me crazy. It's your fault, you tried to trick me. I'm very hungry. Mother will bring lunch. Will you eat here with me? Dine together? I don't have much appetite on my own. I'll get thin, my skin will suffer. I'll be a poor model. That won't do. That's why I want us to dine happily together. Or do you prefer eating with Mommy? What mischief are you planning now? Do you love your mother? Of course I do. She raised a blind boy all by herself. She taught me to read and write, to live as a human being. I love her more than anything. Was it always just you two? Where's your father? He died soon after I was born. Any friends, lovers? Not one. So you've never had a woman? You poor thing. That's why you built this studio. You prefer cold clay to a living, breathing woman. Mother is the only woman I know. Now I know why you make such gigantic figures. They're from a baby's perspective. You love to nestle in their arms like a baby. I wonder. But a real woman is much different. If you had a lover, you'd know. It's much more fun. Is that right? Well, what about meals? Will you eat with me or with Mommy? With you. I'm thrilled. I'd like a drink, too. Alcohol? You like a drink, don't you? It gives you an appetite. No. I've never tried alcohol. You've never had a single drink? You poor thing. It's sublimely delicious. Is that right? I like wine. Go buy some. Another trick? Get me drunk and run away? You're so suspicious. Your mother wouldn't let me past. I've given up trying to escape. Is that true? Will she get angry if you dine with me? No, not at all. She'll do anything I ask her to. I wonder. I'll go get dinner and a drink. That was an excellent meal. I ate every scrap. This wine is wonderful. Is my face flushed? It's a lovely glow. Other than my mother, you're the first person I've dined with. Was it fun? Shall we continue doing it? - Still angry? - No. Shall we get back to work? I'll put these away first. Leave them. Your mother will do it anyway. Carry me up there. You've finished the arms and legs, what's next? Your breasts. Really? Go ahead, touch them. Your fingers are very delicate but ever so masculine. It feels wonderful. So why did you object? At first I didn't like the idea. But I've gradually grown to love you. I didn't realize just how kind you are. I can hardly believe it. There's not another man who worships my body like you. What about that photographer? No, that's different. I'm just another model to him. But I'm your one and only. We women are conceited, we need to dominate. I'm very, very lucky. I really love you. Another trick! You liar! You don't believe me? Here's the evidence. You still doubt me? I'll keep going until you change your mind. No, no, I believe you. I really do. I always thought being blind would repel most women. Do you love me? Of course I do. Was that your first ever kiss? Did you enjoy it? Tongues are so sensitive. Far more so than fingers. So warm, soft and sweet. This time you try it. Michio! What is it, Mother? Stop playing and get back to work. Your mother seems angry. I wonder why. She's shocked. It's her first time to see me in a woman's arms. There's so much I can teach you. Things only a lover knows and a mother cannot do. It's almost dawn. You need your sleep. Don't overtax yourself. I want to keep going. Be happy for me, she's helping me make a unique work of art. Isn't that wonderful? And she loves me. She actually loves me. I doubt it. It sounds unlikely, but it's the honest truth. You idiot. Can't you see she's fooling you? When you let down your guard, she'll escape. I really have fallen in love with him. I could stay here forever. Don't be ridiculous. No gaudy young thing like you would fall for Michio. What's that supposed to mean? Am I so repellent? I know very well what she's up to. She's making a fool of a blind country bumpkin. Is that right? I get it now. Your mother's jealous. She's bad mouthing me for stealing her precious son. Jealous? Mother's jealous? Yes. You're more than a son to her, you know. She's substituted you for her husband or a lover. So she sees me as her rival. Shut up! I can understand it, but it disgusts me. Especially at her age. Is she right, Mother? I won't stand by and watch her make a total fool out of you! Mother, I'm an adult, I want you to stop being jealous. I'm free to fall in love. Is that right? Then do as you please. You're free to go. What's that? Get dressed and get out of here. I can leave? Yes, now go. If you go to the police, I'll get back at you. If it takes all my life, I swear. I understand. There's money in your bag, go and hail a taxi. Hurry up. Mother? Where are you going? It's snowing, we're freezing. I'm just going to get some coal, out of my way. Why not go alone? Why do you have to take her with you? Alright, I'll tell you everything. I'm getting rid of her. But why? The sculpture isn't finished yet. You can get another girl. I'll help you find one. Don't you understand? It has to be her. Not at all. Her type are a dime a dozen. She's unique. I'll never find another like her. Michio, please. Forget all about her. Never! What are you doing? Michio, listen to me. I've done everything you've ever asked for. I helped you buy and then build the studio. Just once, do this one thing for me. Please, get rid of her for me. No, never! Mother. How dare you do this to me? Have you forgotten how I sacrificed everything to raise you? It wasn't easy to raise a blind child. And who was it who gave birth to a blind child? You! Don't you ever forget, Michio, I did my utmost to raise you properly. She's exactly the opposite. She loves herself, she has no feelings for you. If you don't get rid of her now, you'll suffer for it. She's not like that. She's sweet and kind. You have no idea about the outside world. You know nothing about women. A slut like her is nothing but trouble. A slut, am I? That's what we call women who bare their bodies for money. You call it "art," but it's greed and grasping for fame. I'm not like that. I'm a virgin, I've lead a good, honest life. That's a joke! How did you fool Michio? Go on, tell me. What kind of mother humiliates her son's lover? I know what you're trying to do. You want your little boy to stay forever. You want to sleep with him. What did you say? I feel sorry for Michio. With a mother like you, he can never find love. Always alone, Mommy's little plaything. Shut up! Is that what you want? To never experience physical love? Always a little boy, never a real man? I love you. I want to be with you. Is she more important to you than me? How could you... I want to save you from her. I'll even marry you. On the condition that you cut all ties to her. Any real mother would be pleased to raise her son and send him into the world. You bitch! Mother! What are you doing? Please stop it! Please Mother, stop it. That's enough. Help me! I'll kill you, you evil, conniving bitch! I can't breathe! Help me! Please help me. Mother, stop it at once! I can't breathe... Let her go! She's killing me. Mother, will you stop it! Are you alright? Are you hurt? Just a little shaken. Your mother. Something's wrong... What's that? She's dead. Dead? Mother, this can't be! Oh, no! She hit her head on the pillar. It was a freak accident. Mother, no... What have I done to you? You loved me so much... You took care of me... How could I go and kill you? Mother, please forgive me. It was my fault. I was so stupid. Please forgive me. You will stay, won't you? You run away? Let me go, please! She was right. You lied about loving me. Let me go! I'm sick of this. You deliberately provoked my mother. Didn't you? All you want is to escape. Of course I do. How can I possibly stay here? You're evil. You'd deceive a blind man. It was you who killed my mother! It's no use fighting back. You're coming with me. Kill me! Get it over with! I'd rather be dead than suffer like this. You won't get away now. I've got you. In place of Mother, you'll be here till you die! You said I was a "Mommy's boy," didn't you? You said my work is a poor substitute for a real woman. Right! I'll prove to you I'm a man. I'll take your virginity! You beast! You animal! Yes, the beast who killed his mother. I can do anything now. You're all mine, I'll have you. You'll be my lover. I'd rather be dead! No you won't, you'll make a man of me. I'll show you love. Then you'll know. Several days passed. We buried his mother under the dirt floor of the old warehouse. In the studio, with total disregard for day or night, he made love to me repeatedly. By the time he finished the sculpture, I had developed a slight affection for him. Do you still want to leave here? Leave me and go back to your world? Not now. It's strange, but I seem to have forgotten that world. Have you given up because you can't escape? No. I don't hate you any more. Why is that? Making love with you has been wonderful. You're very strong, yet so gentle. You've shown me the true beauty of a woman. Sculptures are inanimate. They can never match the feel of a woman. You are far superior. At the same time as I was falling in love, I, too, began to go blind. Darling. I've started to go blind. Here, in constant darkness, only feeling and caressing your body, my eyes have atrophied, and I've started to go blind. So, you're blind like me now. Is it a demerit? Are you sad? Quite the opposite. People pity the blind, what a big mistake. I pity those who have sight. They can never know the tactile ecstasy of our caresses. You finally understand. I do. My sense of touch is so acute. So sweet, so deep, yet so certain. Shape, form and color can't even approach our tactile level of artistic expression. So I'm not crazy, am I? You're not insane, you're awesome. Your sense of touch is almost not human. I envy you. Some day you'll reach the same level as me. How I wish that day would hurry. The sensation at the tip of my fingers, has become so acute I can almost "taste." As sensitive as insect feelers and animal whiskers. Like the lower orders of life, without eyes, only able to feel. Like an amoeba, or jellyfish, at the dawn of life. The same sensations as the most primeval creature. As if going back to the womb of human creation, so dark, so sweet and so pervadingly familiar. When I look with my eyes, you're a different man to the one I feel. Different? How? You look normal. But to the touch, you're divine. These small depressions, the large curves and projections. As I caress your body, I perceive constant variations. Like the flow of a musical masterpiece. Delicious fun. Is that right? Again, days flew by. We both explored the innermost secrets of our bodies. The most subtle and shaded nuance of each other's flesh. But in our tactile world of touch and feeling, we discovered unwritten, unrelenting, natural laws. So much pleasure only spurred an ever increasing demand for more sensation. Seeking greater satisfaction. An unquenchable desire for ever more pleasure. More! Deeper! Harder! Like this? Not enough. Bite me, bite me hard! Like this? Even harder. Make me bleed. More? Harder, harder! Feels so good! It's my turn. You bite me. That was the beginning. We began to take our pleasure through biting, clawing, and beating our bodies in a rage of sensation. The pain-pleasure from nails, teeth and fists gradually declined in intensity. We began using various devices to stimulate each other. Whip me! The more I suffered, the more I craved. What is it within, that brings forth such ecstasy? Does it mean that I was born with masochistic tendencies? Had I arrived at the point where natural law and the sensations of pleasure collide? We couldn't stop ourselves. We escalated from innocuous devices of pleasure until we turned to knives to extract our ecstasy. You really want me to cut you? Go ahead, do it. Where? Anywhere. Wherever you want. Here? Cut me, cut me. Hurry. Does it hurt? It's agony. But an exquisite pain. Hurt me more. Cover me with scars. How's that? More, more. I don't care if I die. Give it everything. You want me to cut you up? You like that pain? Cut deeper! Cut deep into me and twist the knife. Are you alright? This is so good. More. Drink more of my blood. Now it's your turn. That's when we began the inhuman rite of drinking each others'blood. The ecstasy of it marked our descent into a nonhuman abyss. But constant bliss, such as we felt, was never destined to last for long. The stench of his mother's dead body began to fill the studio. Our bodies cut and scarred, as if from battle, the loss of blood and constant pain began to sap our vitality. We won't last much longer, will we? No, I can barely muster the strength to stand. All we have left is to wait for death to claim us. Do you regret it now? Why should I? I've feasted on a bliss that most people never even know exists. I'm ready to die at any time. I've got a good idea. What is it? If we're to die anyway, make it an ecstatic death for me. Bring me to tears of joy. But how? Cut my arms off. My legs, too. Cut this body of mine into pieces. What for? I'm sure that it will be agony, but also the ultimate ecstasy. As I reach that climax, make it my moment of death. You prefer that to a slow, lingering death? Yes, of course. I beg you. I understand. I'll die along with you. To have my arms and legs cut from my body. What a fitting punishment for our descent into a world where touch was bliss. I gave myself a death sentence. Alright, I'll start to cut. Good. Are you happy? Now the other one. Don't stop now. My legs. Hurry. The world of touch... The world of insects... The lower orders such as the jellyfish... Those who venture to the edge of such worlds, can expect only a dark, dank death to envelope them. The End
