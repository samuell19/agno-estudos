- Do you think that's funny? - No, sir, I always smile at people. Arthur Dillon, the new intermediary between the Seven Sisters of oil' and the Arab countries, in London today THE KILLER... IS ON THE TELEPHONE Miss! - Let's get to the emergency room! - Help me. A good sedative. That’s all. Drink. Doesn’t taste too bad, does it? Must be another emergency. You should take it easy Stay here for a while. Soon you'll feel better. - Isn’t this Via Zwyn? - Yes, why? - Number 89, Via Zwyn? - Certainly But I live here! What's happened to my house? A few years ago there was a building, but they pulled it down a few years ago. They left everything like this, without rebuilding. We’re here to repair the road; that’s all we know Yes? This is the Flemish Theater of Bruges. Pm Eleanor Loraine. Pd like to speak to Mr. Peter please. Who? Mr. Peter Verwoort. I would like to speak to him immediately Yes, I understand. One moment, please. Miss Dorothy your sister's on the phone... She asked to speak.. • with Mr. Peter. Eleanor, when did you come back? Dorothy! I want Peter. - Didn't you hear me? - Yes, I heard you. - So, where's Peter? - Eleanor, you know that Peter is dead. - But... that's absurd; we talked recently - Where? - A short time ago. - Where? Here... that ts... on the phone. The other day we went together to take flowers to the cemetery But where are you now? Eleanor? Eleanor! Reply Dorothy! - Who told you I was here? - I know you're always here. - Always? - Of course, and often with me. Don’t you remember?i Where are we going? Let's go home. You are very tired and need rest. Yes, I'm very tired... tired and confused. How did he die? When? Who are you? I'm Dr. Chandler. We've met before. - No, I don't think so. - Yes, at the theater. - Are you an actor? - I'm a doctor, Dr. Chandler. One day you had an accident on the stage... During a performance of Pelléas and Mélisande. They asked if there was a doctor in the house... So I introduced myself to your husband. But I don't know this man... I'm not married. Eleanor, it's George, your husband., We got married three years ago. We decided in just a few days. Perhaps you wanted to avoid my criticism in the newspaper! All right... we don't need to play any more games! Enough! Just tell me what you want! Money? If I've been kidnapped, I'll pay even though I'm not very rich. I'll pay you! How much do you want? Tell me, how much! - Eleanor! But you're at home! - Via Zwyn, #897 If not money what do you want? It's a conspiracy? You want to drive me crazy.. but why? - Eleanor... - Why? Don't touch me! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy! Dorothy.. they're all against me... help me! No! Dorothy! Dorothy! No! How did Peter die? Want breakfast in bed tomorrow? Don't you knock before entering? Clean underwear? - Of course. Then, you want breakfast in the room? - No. Is there anything I can do for you? You... have any suggestions? Yes? - KLM Reservations. Mr. Ranko Dragonitch? - Yes, speaking. Flight 606 to London will be leaving tomorrow at 12:25. - Do you want to confirm your reservation? - Yes. Thanks. But you must recognize me! Everyone knows... Eleanor Loraine and Thomas Braun. We're famous... We're rehearsing a new show. Here in Belgium, we've played together in every theater together during the last four years. Another actor... You're all actors, reciting your parts. I'm tired, I don't want to talk anymore. Leave me alone. What should we do now? You're the doctor. I’d like to try a small shot of sodium pentothal. Truth serum! But isn’t that dangerous? Only for those afraid of the truth. That's right. Is anybody here afraid of it? Of course not. I hope that it will unlock her mind, freeing her subconscious. - I understand. - I have your permission? - Well, I don't think you'll need me... - Where are you going? - I'd rather you stayed here. - Why? It would be better... if we all remained together. Truth, truth, truth... Truth... Poor Pirandello. Two drops of sodium pentothal and his philosophy goes down the drain. - You’ll see, it’ll go all right, George. - Yes, I hope so. It's something disgusting, poking around in a person's soul! Peter... Peter... Where are you, Peter? Peter... I picked many beautiful flowers. It was such a wonderful day and then... I can't remember! What's wrong... I dropped the flowers... Peter! I wanted to help, but I can't move! I can't move, I'm paralyzed! Peter! Peter... wait... wait! Here I am! Stop! Don't go! Peter, I'm coming! Wait! Please, Peter. No! Peter... help me... He has a knife! • He wants to kill me! help! He wants to kill me! The knife! Peter where are you? Help! No! No! No! No... When Peter died... It was a terrible car accident. She suffered a terrible trauma. She was very fond of Peter. They loved each other very much. Eleanor told me everything. But Peter Verwoort died five years ago. Yes, I know. Eleanor's suffering from a form of amnesia. She's lost her memory The vacuum in her mind begins with the death of Peter. From that moment on, she doesn't remember anything. In shoe, she refuses to accept • the reality of his death. And her only memories are those from the time before he died. Eleanor asked for him this morning because she believed he was still alive. She's forgotten everything that's happened since that accident. Five years. It's as if the last Eve years of her life have been wiped out. That's why she doesn't know who we are. - Because you met her during those five years. - She only recognizes me. I didn’t expect her to react the way she did under the drug. Maybe you understood more than I did? Damn it all. I'm beginning to feel seriously worried about the show. Remember that Lady Godiva premieres on Saturday! To forget her lines is one thing, but it looks like she's even forgotten who we are! How did she get into this state? You don't have any ideas yourself? She went to London last Thursday for a television program. She was perfectly normal then. I also phoned and... she was fine. She's in a state of chronic anxiety verging on paranoia. But her fear of being killed may also have some basis in reality - Do you think it's possible that someone wants to kill her? - Yes, it's possible. We know about the trauma that she underwent five years ago. But we know nothing about the one she went through today What do you propose to do, then? She might make a sudden improvement... It can happen. However, I'd prefer to keep her here... at least, for a while. - Did you know him, Peter? - No, but I knew his mother, Eleanor. I was called in to treat her, before she died. It's weird... and strange to think... that if Eleanor had married Peter, she would have been the second Eleanor Verwoort. Hi! Walter, I think this position is wrong. What should I do? I move further forwards, and you, Dorothy go to the right. To his left, I mean. So close in front of him? It's not too close? Dorothy just do it like I tell you! - If the table's in the way I'll move it. - No, it's OK. Here I am! Sorry for the delay Terrible traffic - We've been looking everywhere for you. - Ah, yes? Why? - Are you okay? - Of course. - Are you sure you're up to rehearsing? - Yes, that's why I'm here. - Why are you looking at me like that? Is something wrong? - No... What shall we try? The monologue scene? Okay Thomas, take it from the top. The other set. "I, Lord Leofric, Earl of Mercia, Lord of Coventryu "and your husband, "have come to propose to you a great challenge." "What challenge, my lord?" "What challenge, my lord? "Come, you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts. “unsex me here, and fill me from the crown to the toe... "top-ful of direst cruelty! "Come to my woman's breasts, "And lake my milk for gall, you murdering ministers, "wherever you wait on nature's mischief! "Come, thick night, and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, "That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, "nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark, to cry 'Hold, hold!"' So, how was it? It needs some work, but it can't have been that bad. It was impeccable, but it was Lady Macbeth. Of course it was Lady Macbeth! Darling, we're supposed to be rehearsing Lady Godiva... And we open on Saturday night. All right. We'll have a quick break. In 10 minutes, we'll resume without Eleanor. You’ll be fine by Saturday. I’ll call a taxi. - You call George and tell him to wait at home. - Yes. - What's the matter with her? - She's lost her memory again. - It's happened before? - What, you don't know? Unbelievable! She hasn't played Lady Macbeth in five years! I was in it with her, and I cut a fine figure in the pa of Duncan. She's not been the same since Peter Verwoort died. It seems she was with him that day Don't ask me why they were together. - I was supposed to take you home. - Right here, thanks. - Are you looking for something? - I don't know. He has changed his flight to London. Tomorrow, at 12:25. - Every time I come here, I always ask myself the same questions. - Like? - How does it feel to be rich? - I'll tell you... "These lucky creatures are subject to four great evils: "mistrust, loneliness, corruption and boredom." Bravo! Signed: George Bernard Shaw. Money certainly hasn't saved this family from terrible accidents. No, but money is very good at relieving pain, the pain of those left behind. Even so, here's an example... Oh, Miss Verwoortu. Excuse me, I didn't mean to... Save your facetiousness for the appropriate place... On stage, Thomas, and not in my house. And now, please be seated. Shall we come straight to the point? I heard that... young Eleanor... Has lost not only her reputation, but her memory as well, unfortunately She's had a terrible breakdown. I talked to Dr. Chandler, I know the problem well. Walter, do we intend to keep our commitments and open with this show, or not? - Yes, of course, Miss Verwoort. - Well, then let's be practical. As you know, your kind of theater bores and depresses me, but the Flemish Theater has belonged to my family for many generations. So, I want everything to function properly according to the plan. I agree with you absolutely - Dorothy - What is it, Miss Verwoort? You, my dear, shall substitute for your sister in the part. She's not a better actress than you, you know? Though she’s perhaps... more attractive, I must admit. She also has more character. Really.. I think my sister... I mean to say her amnesia will be gone by then. You see, Eleanor's amnesia, as you call it, doesn't convince me. Do you think Eleanor is pretending? That her amnesia and the rest, it’s all a hoax? I just think that, sometimes, losing one's memory can be extremely useful. So, then... Love is like a sch-boiled egg: three minutes. What are you doing? Gotta go, my love. Why? It’s still early. Where are you going? Where? Where?! Hey calm down. I don't have to account for every move I make... And certainly not to you. Are we clear? Who taught you to make love? - Why do you want to know? - Tell me... What counts most, in love, is how you make it. Please... tell me. You really want to know? As usual, you're a glutton for punishment. A teacher... My maths teacher, when I was 13 years old. During a school trip, I cut one of my knees. He treated the cut... and then he took off my panties. What did you do? I got him to give me money and lots of it, too! - You needed money? - Of course not! Italy father didn't let me want for anything. But he didn't love you... Your parents neglected you? You really are naive.. And you're no better than a whore... If you were like that at 13, what the hell have you been doing slnoe?! How many men have you had? Eh? And what about now? Behind my back? So many I can't keep count. But one thing's for certain: they were happy with me! - They didn't whine like babies, they were men! - Before! But you make me sick! You spend your life kissing the ass of anyone who might be useful to you. You'd kill your own mother, if it meant success! And yet, with me, you have the nerve to moralize - You're not leaving me, are you? - Yes. I agree, I talked like an idiot, but don't leave me... I need you... Without you, I can’t... Don't leave me... Don't leave me... Don't leave me! - Take me home. - Okay but give me the address. - 89... - 89, and then what? - No... number I You're here, thank goodness! I've been looking for you everywhere. - Why? - I was afraid something might have happened to you. Really? Well, I’m fine. Eleanor! You have to trust me, I want to help you. Will you let me? - Are you really my husband? - Of course! - And... We've been married how long? - For the last three years. Three years... That's a long time. - Were we happy? - I thought so. - You 'thought so'? - Actually I'm sure of it. You're lying! I betrayed you many times, and you know it! - With who? - With... Thomas, for one. - With Thomas? - With him and many others! - I don't believe it! - Rather, you don't want to believe ii! You refuse to believe ii! You hate me, you want revenge - you're putting a plan in place, with the purpose of killing me! I'll get it. Hello? Hello! - They hung up, without saying anything. - Really? Want a drink? We could both do with one. Sit down. Scotch? Eleanor! Eleanor, open up! Eleanor! Please don't be like that! Eleanor! Eleanor! Fools! If you have something that shoots in your pocket, forget about it. - Why are you bugging me? - You didn't leave, as agreed! - Yes, that's right. - We paid you! That's right, too. Half in advance, and half on completion. - Plus... expenses. -Plus expenses. Why did you let him get away at the harbor?! I have a personal matter to attend to ttrst. Why did you stay here, and not goto London? I have to pull the chain first.! I hate to leave bad odors.i Do you understand? And now, get out! - Hello? - Thomas... This is Eleanor. - Oh? - Yes. I see you still live at Torenbrug. Yes, of course. We spent a lot of time together there... didn't we? Ah, you remember? That's good. I must see you right away Thomas. It's very important. I'll wait for you. Don't kid yourself that whiskey will give you the courage you lack. Listen, I... I want to... I know what you want. You're ambitious. so am I. But we can't wait forever; we must take a short cut. But the fear in you may prove stronger than the ambition. - A short cut? -Yes... There's only one way: kill him! And then you'll be in charge. I agree... I’ll do it. Whatever you want. But soon. He already knows about us; he's not a man who'll wait forever. I think he’s already decided to get rid of me. I'm not going to give him the chance! I couldn’t live without you. Without you, I’d kill myself, too. What good would my life be alone? I couldn’t go on living without you. Darling! My love! Here... Here, darling... here. - Was it him? - No, one of his men. - I'll call a doctor! - No! It's too late. You'll be alright, once we get you to the hospital. We're not leaving here. You said... you couldn't live without me... and I'm going to die. Do you still love me? Always. It was. a play! Thomas! No, Thomas, please, stop! Listen: you always rejected me, and it’s not like I didn’t try plenty. Then you start acting as though we'd been lovers for ages. You said, "let's goto bed," I didn't talk you into it. Then, all of a sudden, you have second thoughts. What do you want? I was convinced that we were lovers, but I didn't feel anything for you, and I wondered why Then I thought... that if we made love, I would remember. - Don't you understand? - Frankly I don't. Now I know that we were never lovers. But I've been having some strange memories about you and me... Frightening! - Thanks! - Oh, you didn't frighten me, Thomas! In these memories, I was trying to force you to kill someone who wanted to murder me. But it was just that modem version of Macbeth we did together! Now I know nobody wants to kill me, they were just memories of the play I don't understand very clearly yet, but I think a drink will help! Thomas, you're an attractive man, and I'm sorry I behaved so with you. You re sorry! Now you’ve figured that out, maybe your memory will return. You must try to help me. It's hard for me to put things into some order in my mind. It's like being in a foreign country knowing only a few words of the language. You hear something and you think you understand, but then people use words that you don't know, and nothing makes sense. The only thing that makes sense right now... is to try to get back to work. I thought I'd come here in person, to see exactly how things are going. We'll make sure you're satisfied, Miss Verwoort. I have several friends who want to attend on opening night. Since they are so misguided as to insist on seeing the play.. I would at least like to ensure they're not treated worse than usual. Meanwhile, you could make a start by cleaning the seats. Certainly I take a note of that. Your brother Peter loved this theater. He then came by to watch the rehearsals. Italy brother loved an actress in this theater. Which is something entirely different. In any case, I'm pleased that you're taking an interest in our work. For the moment, my interest is limited to the comfort of my friends. Thank you, my dear. Ah... good luck, all the same. I just hope this champagne isn't the only good thing that you have here. I'll be ready in a minute. Who else was in the theater when it happened? Myself and my secretary - And... and you, madam? - Yes, I was here too. Did you see or hear anything that could help us in any way? Do you think that, if I knew anything, I would have waited until now to tell you?! No, I don’t know anything... And I’ve been here long enough. No, no, I haven't finished yet. Come in. - No news of Eleanor, I suppose? - None. Poor thing... I'm afraid she has no idea as yet... Of the tragedy she has caused. You can’t blame Eleanor for what’s happened. I I didn’t say that I did. I just made a simple observation. Alter all, I'm grateful to Eleanor for one thing at least... She never became the wife of my brother. George! - Have you ever been to St. Andrew's Drive, on the road to Ostend? - Yes. Then you know that Eleanor has a lovely cottage down there. - No. - No? She never told you about it? Well, she bought it a long time ago. It dates back to when she first fell in love with Peter. - Are you sure? - Hmm? Oh, yes, very sure. And I also understand why she wanted to keep it secret. What's that word they use in the tabloid press... What do they call it? A Love-nest? We both have a duty to protect her... Why not goto St. Andrew's Drive, to see if she's there? Well, sir... KLM Flight 102, tomorrow morning at 10:30. I see you finally decided. Indecision is not only a woman’s prerogative. - Do you think that's funny? - No, sir, I always smile at people. I don't like men smiling at me... It makes me think they're queer. - So, you haven't learned your lesson, eh? - I had to End you. - They want to talk to you. They've been calling the hotel. - Really? They're not supposed to make any contact. That's the rule, remember? Besides, what are they worried about? I've never failed an assignment. But... you don't understand. I understand everything. "Bon voyage." George! Poor Dorothy! They killed her, believing she was me. I suspected... you too, but then I realised...i you wouldn't have made that mistake. I have no more doubts in my mind now: someone is trying to kill me! - Yes, but try to calm down. - But why? What have I done? - It's best if we contact the police. - No! - Why not? Not until I End out what I've done. I cant remember... I cant piece together the mosaic of my memories. Maybe I've done something terrible... I might have killed someone. - But I don't remember anything. - No... no, I don't believe that. How can you be so sure? I'm not. Why didn't you ever tell me about that chalet? - What chalet? - The one on St. Andrew's Drive. You used to go there with Peter. I spoke to Margaret Verwoort. St. Andrew's Driven. Peter, promise me you won't tell anyone about the existence of this chalet... -Especially Margaret. - Are you still convinced that she disapproves of us? - Yes. - You'll see, she'll change her mind. - All the same, promise me. - I promise. You know that Margaret is only interested in controlling the business. She likes to be the virgin queen of the boardroom. And she's welcome to it. - She still doesn't want us to get married. - How can she stop us? - Because you never refuse her anything. - Oh, come on... -What makes her so jealous?1 - What makes you think that’s it? Her way of looking at me. But she's like that with everyone: very cold and very clear. Yes, I know... But when she looks at me, it's different. It almost seems like she hates me. PETER! PETER! PETER! George! George! At last, I remember everything! George! George! No! Stop! Help! Stop! Help! Anyone?! Mr. Dillon, in charge of United Nations attempts to reach a settlement... Between the Arab oil suppliers and the Seven Sisters of oil arrived in London this morning. Overshadowing the international significance of the conference, were persistent rumors... that Mr. Dillon was to have been the victim of an assassination pl] However so far there have been no serious causes for alarm. The mission entrusted to Mr. Dillon is very difficult to resolve. It involves enormous vested interests worldwide. A failure to reach agreement could lead to a diplomatic rupture between the parties. Her&s Mr. Dillon arriving at the headquarters of the Minis fry of Foreign Trade, where he will meet counselors and economic delegates from European countries... in order to examine the • situation further. You're looking very well, Eleanor. I'm glad. So, Peter broke his promise... He told you about our chalet. Peter never hid anything from me. Then why did you have him killed? I'm afraid you're not as well... as you look. When you told George about the chalet.., you confessed. No, that's not true. Your sister was dead. I really thought you might save George. Enough blood has been shed already for such an old affair - So you've admitted your guilt. - You could never prove it. Ranko is dead, which is nothing more than he deserved. I hadn't told him to kill Peter, just to frighten him into going away for a while. I never knew that my brother he had a gun. And Ranko made it look like an accident. Precisely! Wait! George is dead. And Dorothy. I’ve lived through Peter’s death twice... And now I don't care if I live or die! But now you're going to tell me why you hate me so much! Why you've destroyed everything that gave meaning to my life! Why? Why.? Because I always wanted you for myself, Eleanor. For you... death is too easy You'll be in such pain, you'll wish you were dead. I'll make your life hell. That will be your punishment. As long as you live, Margaret. English subtitles by Iordretsudo
