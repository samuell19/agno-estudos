A real paradise. No other park has such rich and various fauna. More than 700 species of exotic and aquatic birds, elephants, crocodiles, reptiles and gazelles. But I assure you I'll never try it again. A great engineering work was needed to be able to respect ecological necessities. To give you an idea I?ll just say that it takes 3 months by boat to bring the materials and equipment here, and you can only go up the rivers when they're full. That's the Kuma tribe, they're peaceful natives. Tourism can only improve them. They've found work with us, and our settlement hasn't disturbed their tranquility. Good, here we are. Welcome to our earthly paradise. You know I sometimes ask myself if Eve was black, what do you think? I'm not sure, but Adam was definitely a shit. You certainly couldn't say you're a talkative type. Why? I always go 'click', don't I? Well, lets see what you're capable of. I want the photos of this hotel to appear in all the world's advertising magazines with "A piece of Manhattan comfort in the primitive scenery of earthly paradise" written below. Ah, Mr. Nessel, this is my valuable assistant... - Welcome. ...Alice Brandt. Alice through the looking glass? You still believe in fairy tales, Mr. Nessel? My name's Sheena. Nice to meet you. The car's waiting for us, shall we go? You're not coming? No, I'm going to take some photos. Is cruelty part of the tourist excursion? These big animals are very shy and solitary, they only stay because they can find food here. Look at that. Have you read the sign? It says 'Crocodile Bridge', and if the tourists don't see crocs they think they've been tricked. Whereas it's those poor piglets who are tricked in this earthly paradise. Tarzan's Raft, with an engine! He used lianas, you know. Can you imagine the tourists hanging from lianas? And the oarsmen make the setting picturesque. To be honest, they also seem a bit false. But you can't say the landscape's not right. Look, we've even thought of a really exciting diversion for adventure-lovers. We're fencing-off the lagoon down there so the tourists will almost be able to swim with the crocodiles. Know what effect this place has on me? It's like a big trap. Be careful, you might be the bait. Look his foot's the bait! It could end up like the piglets. I don't think I'm easily digestible, and the crocodiles might complain about the food. Sheena! What's going on? Have they gone mad? What's got into those bloody savages? Tapui say Kruna, great evil god, in river. He very bad. We fear. - What is it? - I don't know, something really big. It could capsize the raft! Come back! Where are you going you cowards? What are you doing? Come back here now! The great god Kruna's just a tree trunk! Thank you, George. So, do you like the show Alice? I prefer the champagne. Okay, that's enough. That's enough! Stop it, please. Stop! How do you say 'stop' in their language? Thanks for everything guys. You can have a drink and get the presents. Hey, Kurg, they're too big, they're not for you. If they're on Kurg's legs, they're Kurg's. - Don't you want some more champagne? - No, thank you. She's got some airs, hasn't she? Bring it to my room. What was it like here before? Before what? Before you all came to ruin everything with your 'paradise'. It depends. Living from hunting and fishing, raising kids, respecting the elderly, owning everything communally in the tribe, but living just 30 years on average. What's that to you mind, paradise or hell? Well, don't ask me, I'm already 36. Now they'll live longer. Seems like a sentence the way you say it. Maybe 30's the right time to die. You've had the best of life and you're not afraid it'll all end. I think the best's yet to come for us. Hope's a youngsters' feeling. - You know that... - Zuri! What did you tell her? That her father was waiting for her in the village. She's the village chief Andimari's daughter. Best leave her alone. Excuse me. When will we have some photos? Black and white tomorrow. The color goes to L.A. For the agency to choose. I want all the advertising to be based on virgin nature. There's a New York brothel which used the same advertising! These days someone who can have a week's virginity doesn't worry about the cost. The first group arrives tomorrow, it's just a trial run. If it works, we'll organize a club, charter flights, year round group holidays. 'Enter paradise now! Perhaps you won't be able to tomorrow'. Not bad. To the Kuma, and to those of them who manage to survive. Good night. - Alice. - Yes? I've got to develop some black and white photos. If you have time, why don't you keep me company? Alright, I'm curious to see your masterpieces. You'll be disappointed. The usual advertising brochure stuff. What do you think? And the fragile butterfly lands on the ferocious crocodile's nose, crushing it with its weight. Well, it definitely had a lot of guts. I'd never have landed on the crocodile's nose, I swear. - Lets go, I've finished. - Perhaps you don't know that, these small and delicate creatures will continue to reproduce long after the tough crocodiles are extinct. Which shows that those who have the biggest fangs and claws are never the strongest. The drum playing is like this afternoon. The Kuma are having a ceremony to cast out a bad omen. How come you're so well-informed about these people? It's my job. I thought you were a kind of hotel manager. I am, but I graduated in anthropology and this job was the only way to get out here. Look, there's someone down there on the water. Yes, it's strange. They're going to the Isle of Love. The Kuma religion forbids coupling under a full moon. Perhaps it's a lovers tryst. You don't seem like an idiot, so don't act like one. Do you fancy coupling with me? Do you always ask so tactfully? No, I could be more explicit. If I can be explicit, you're wasting time... - What was it? - I don't know. - There's no more poetry. - What? Today's youngsters just want to shake their arses. What did you say? I said they just want to shake their arses. Cheers. I'm used to tropical heat but it's crippling today. What did you say? You can't speak with this music. I'm sorry, I can't hear you because of the music. Joshua! Sheena's not in her room or out here. Where could she be? I don't know, have you looked in some bedrooms? Mrs. Stuhle, how are you, - everything alright? - Very well, thanks. Minou, please stop it! I knew it'd be the usual hotel for American tourists. I should have gone to the sea with the Sisters. I wanted to ask you about the safari photography excursion. Of course. Ali. Do you want to look after our smallest guest? Certainly. - Come with me. - Thanks. - Ciao, what's your name' - Minou, and yours? I'm Ali. - Want to play with me? - Sorry, but I'm like my mum. I only have fun with males. But you look nice. Come on, lets go. You're Milena, aren't you? Yes, and you're one who tries it on. You know why distracted elephants don't have kids? Oh, alright, finish the joke. Because sometimes they get it wrong and screw with their trunks! You can tell you're French. - And what would you have said? - Turd! - Do you like it? - Do you think I still play with dolls? I'm sorry. - Ali. - Yes? Ali, I can't find Sheena, she's not in her room. That's strange. She was a bit stoned last night but... She might have gone with one of those Kuma boys. Well, Sheena can do almost anything, but I don't think she's the type to make love for 10 hours solid without the comforts of a nice bedroom. If you say so. Shall we check the lagoon? Come Minou. Where are the Kuma? It's hard to understand them. Not one of them came here today so we've got to do their work too. - Sapuli, have you finished? - Not yet. What happened to that canoe? I don't know, we've only just recovered it. It looks like one of the Kuma's. The ones we saw last night? Yes, I think so. Strange, the wood's not rotted. I hadn't noticed. This must have happened recently. Could a crocodile have done it? Not even the biggest one alive. Only the great god Kruna could do that, but the god Kruna doesn't exist. Ali! The other clients are arriving. Yes, I'm coming. Why don't you show Joshua? He's only interested in money. If you want my opinion it was a monster, a monster who lives in the river. Monsters don't exist, Minou. - Are you sure? - Of course. Maybe the Kuma know more about this than we do. This way. Didn't you notice the pilot wouldn't take his eyes off me? There's always something: Last time the pilot who was supposed to take us to Bermuda lost his way and we were heading towards Cuba. We all thought it was a high-jacking... Oh my God, what a lovely place! Mummy, mummy! Hey, mum! Did you know there's a monster in the river? Of course there is, dear. Now why don't you go back and play with your friends? I don't want to play the gooseberry, they want to be alone. - Joshua... - Not now, my friend. Later please. Good day, good day! Oops. Thank you. Welcome to Paradise House. I hope you have an unforgettable stay. As you saw from the helicopter, we're surrounded by an authentic virgin forest with magnificent genuine indigenous primitives... Please, I've got to talk to you for a moment. Would you excuse me? This is Alice Brandt, my assistant. She'll take care of you. Come with me. Welcome. I'm at your service. The rooms are ready if you are. I really need to get my fitness back, I hope there's a good masseuse. George will show you to your rooms. I hope I've got quiet people next to mine. I don't want anyone to come and bother me at night, as happened in Mombassa. Don't worry, I hope I'll be next to you. You have the gift of almost always arriving at the wrong time. I think Sheena's dead. What are you saying? They found the wreckage of a canoe in the river. It was damaged in a strange way. They found a canoe, so? I think Sheena was with a Kuma in that canoe last night. Listen to me, Daniel, you came here to take photos and that's all. You do your job and let me do mine. What you're saying is unlikely. No-one can leave the hotel at night, there's security and scrupulous surveillance. I wouldn't say it was that scrupulous. There was a canoe on the river last night, and someone screamed, someone who was terrified, and that's when the canoe disappeared. In a canoe on the river at night?! Where did she think she was, on a boat on the Thames? Daniel, you don't intend to scare my guests, do you? - Relax, I'll get someone to look for her. - Right now? Yes, right now. But remember these people came here on holiday to try and have some fun. Don't scare them, hmm? I want to go to the Kuma village. - Can I take one of your motor boats? - Okay, but don't create a panic, alright? - I can't wait to get some sun. - Oh yes, how lovely! I know you. You're the man I saw in Paris. - You're mistaken, my dear. - Please excuse her. Liar! You came here to touch mum's tits! I've already spied on you through the keyhole. Minou! The village isn't far, is it? They told me it was 2 miles before the rivers meet. Just 2 miles, but it's 20 centuries from here. Daniel, what are you doing, where are you going? - To the Kuma village. - Did you talk to Joshua? Relax, I've got your boss's permission. I'll come with you. Ali! Ali! Joshua wants to see you straight away! Ali went with him. This is all getting a bit silly. I know what to do when she returns. Take it easy, Joshua. Best to keep those two happy. If something's happened to that black that photographer could cause us a lot of trouble. Alright. Send someone to find Sheena, and do it now. Okay. - Come on! - Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on! It's wonderful! Come on, jump in! Even if you mess your pants no-one will notice. - Who do you think you are? - Come on! What's he doing? You don't think something's happened to him, do you? No. Lets see how long he can stay under without messing his pants! A minute's already passed. Is he trying to scare us? I don't think it's funny at all. There's no danger inside the fence, is there? No, definitely not. A minute and a half. Come on, he's playing around! Lets go and check. We'll surprise him. - Did I scare you? - Idiot! I caught you out! - Stop it! - Come on! It's a funeral ceremony, a warrior has died. It's those 3 women's duty to cry. They're burning a fetish to send the evil spirit away. He says we whites have to leave their territories. The great river spirit has re-awakened and is punishing them because they became our friends. He's saying that one's died already and the others will die. My brother dead and also your black woman dead. Bad god come and punish we Kuma. - Kusha, you saw the god Kruna? - A lot saw it. Also white man saw it. - Which white man? - He called Father Jonathan. You speak with him, then you go. I take you to him. Lets go. Look! Boat not good for other river. We leave it there, find it return. Alright. Up there. I am Father Jonathan! You go. Look, see how that rock's carved! Who are you? We're friends, we want to talk to you. The Kuma say you've seen their god, Kruna. It's true, but it was a long time ago. What do you want? To tell you that Kruna has killed again. Kruna's back, Kruna's back! Why did you come here, Father Jonathan? To bring the light, and to defeat evil. You were alone? No, I wasn't alone, there was also Sister Virginia, the ones from the Mission. There were 12 of them, yes 12, 12, 12. Like the Apostles; 12... - all dead. - Killed by savages? No, it was him. He waited for us in the river and capsized our boat. - Was it a crocodile? - It's not an animal, it's a demon! This is what it looks like. I did it with my own hands, it took all these years, to keep him away. He can't stand seeing his own image. He killed all the others. Yes, all of them! He killed them one at a time, all of them, and now it's my turn. Why don't you leave here with us, Father Jonathan? There's a hotel a few miles from here, and a helicopter that can take you anywhere. No, you were sent by him! You want me to go back on the river? I'll never go back on the river! It's strange, that's not a crocodile's head, it looks more like a caiman, but caimans only live in South America. Go away! Go away!! You are demons. Yes, you're demons sent by him! I understood straight away. Leave or I'll kill you! - Come on, lets go. - You're demons! Evil creatures sent by him! Get out, go away! Away! Away! They've gone. Did they think I'd fall into their trap? What's wrong, Ali? I'm thinking about that missionary. He came here so these people would believe in his god, but now he believes in one of theirs. If I hadn't seen the remains of that canoe, I'd have thought he was just hallucinating. Kruna! Kruna!! - Ali! - Daniel! Ali, you know perfectly well it's dangerous to go beyond the confines of the hotel alone, that's why it's prohibited. Those who stay inside and respect the safety regulations have got nothing fear. Of course there are crocodiles in the river. I know that. They're part of the natural environment. Have you seen the fences protecting the lagoon? They're steel. Joshua, I know crocodiles. The thing that overturned the boat and killed Kusha was something else. And it killed Sheena, but you're obstinately ignoring the evidence. You're wrong, I've had them look for her everywhere, and I've already informed the authorities about her disappearance by radio. Sheena hasn't disappeared, she was killed. There's something monstrous in that river and you can't hide the danger from your clients. If there's something monstrous in that river you're perfectly safe if you stay on dry land. Daniel, why do you keep coming up with these absurd fantasies? We've invested 3 million dollars in this business and I have no intention of risking it because of a photographer who sees danger everywhere. - I want to speak to the police myself. - Alright, you can speak to them tomorrow, they're coming here at dawn. After which you'll do me the immense pleasure of leaving me in peace. You've taken the photos, your work's done. - Take the first helicopter tomorrow. - Where's the radio? You're not talking to anyone, I forbid it. Ali, be careful. You're risking everything. I'm leaving with him tomorrow morning. Hello, hello? Paradise House here. Can you hear me? - Emergency, emergency. - Yes? We can hear you Paradise House. I want to inform you that a girl has mysteriously disappeared. We've already been informed. I know, but there's been another... We're coming to investigate tomorrow. What the hell do you think you're doing? Nobody's allowed in here. Take your hands off me! Don't let him give you orders, Peter. That's enough, Peter. The party's tonight, and tomorrow we'll put him on the helicopter, one way or another. This is real dancing! - In our day... - I wasn't around in your day. Sorry, I didn't want to offend you. - Mummy, mummy, come quickly! - What's happening? Yes, dear? There's someone with a crocodile's head outside! A man with a crocodile's head! Inge, you remember that party at Eurilla's house when Arturo came into my bedroom totally nude - wearing a big mouse mask? - Noo! This is a man with a crocodile's head. I'll show you. Lets go. Lets go. He's gone. It was your imagination. No, mum, there was a black man with a head this big. Come on, Minou, what are you saying? I think you read too many fairy tales. I know of an old Kuma war rite. Crocodile-men represent the reincarnations of their dead who return to earth to get revenge on their enemies. Well, perhaps they're having a carnival too and they're wearing masks in the village tonight, maybe they came here to see how we entertain ourselves. But now we can return to our own less picturesque but more entertaining, customs. Bye. Talking of voyeurs, I had the impression that someone was spying on my intimacy when I was alone in my room. Didn't you conceal yourself? Why? I've go nothing to hide! Mr. Joshua! ...I've go nothing to hide, I'm not afraid of being seen naked. Depends on where and with whom... The helicopter's been dragged into the river! No-one saw anything. - Tracks are deep. - Dragging it took a lot of power. Sapuli, help them attach the cable. I've got to stay underwater a long time to attach it. There's breathing apparatus in the explosives van. Yes, I know. Be careful, if they took it that far it could be a trap, and then there's always the risk of crocodiles. The crocodiles sleep in the mud at night, at least the ones from good homes! Don't force it if it doesn't move. Inflate the balloons with the air in the cylinders and bring it to the surface. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. You'd better stay here. If you don't manage, secure it well. We'll find a way in the light tomorrow. Alright. Why don't you go underwater? Daniel, you always find a way not to mind your own business. What fun! Could I have one of those apples? Not yet, it's too soon. You know the story of Adam and Eve, don't you little girl? Of course! It's when God plays his first joke on man. Well... They've thrown the helicopter in the river. - Who, the Kuma? - Who else? Why? They've always been friendly, they've helped and worked for us. Yes, until yesterday. Then suddenly they didn't come to work and they started their strange rites. Because they think the god Kruna's returned. Whatever. Call the police now and tell them to bring more helicopters and men. Paradise House, Paradise House. This is Paradise House calling. I don't understand, there's no signal output... - Damn, the antenna! - What could have happened? Someone's disconnected the antenna, we can't communicate with anyone. We're in trouble. Ali! Ali? - Have you seen Miss Ali? - No, I haven't. Why, was she here too? I've attached the first cable, give me the second one. When I've fixed it to the pontoons we can try to pull it out, but slowly. Alright, I'll give it to you now. What's happening? It's pulling the jeep into the water! You must have been mad to pull that hard! And you should have waited for my order. But it wasn't us who pulled it, - it was pulled from the water. - What? That's what happened. I don't get it... The mud must have given a bit, it's all mire down there. The cables are attached anyway, Put it in low gear, a bit of accelerator. So try and pull it out slowly. Damn, I knew it. Someone climbed up here, cut the cable and destroyed the antenna. How come nobody saw or heard anything? Weren't there any guards? Mr. Joshua, - they're waiting for you. - Waiting for me? Why? - For the lagoon tour. - Right. You shouldn't do it. Lots of people are already on the raft. I wouldn't know what excuse to give them, and it would be worse to frighten them now. - Anyway, we won't go far. - Alright. See? The youngsters are unrestrained tonight. Well, this exotic atmosphere would stir anyone up! Joshua, have you seen Ali? I haven't seen her. She was with me at the heliport, didn't she come here? No, she could be in her room, sir. Come on George, lets not waste time. Ali? Ali?! My god, it's Ali! Come back! Come back, the Kuma have taken Ali! Come back!! Lets see what lovely stuff the jungle by night will show us. Look over there. That's a very rare kind of monkey. Really? I've got an uncle who looks just like that! - Honestly! - And who does that remind you of? My cousin. It's not worth growing up. Look! I really can't stand those beasts. Why did you do it? It wasn't necessary. Cheers... Hey, can you hear me? Hey, you on the raft! Can you hear me? Daniel, Daniel! Hey, Daniel's here in a boat! The Kuma have caught Ali, I don't know where they're taking her. What? Shut up! She's in danger, they're taking her to the other side. Come here, handsome! Where are you going all alone in that boat? Say hello to Tarzan! Hey! Where are you going? Come here and have a drink! Sapuli, it's best we go back to the hotel. - Yes sir. - Hurry up. Help! - Help! - Help! Help... Help! - The current's carrying me away! - Give him a rope! Throw him a rope! Mummy, mummy! Help! Pull him out, quickly! There it is, it's coming back! It's gone to the other side! It's destroyed the engine! If we get to the fences we're safe. Lets keep calm! There they are. The current will help us to reach them. Help! Help! We'll never climb over the fences, there are old people, the girl. That's right, how will we do it? It's impossible! We need another boat now, I'll go and get it. - Don't go, don't go! - Are you crazy? Come back here, it's dangerous! - Maurice! - No, don't come Milena! No!! Hurry up, jump over! Go on!! Come on! Help, help!! Go the hotel and get someone. - Ali. - Daniel! Ali! I can't untie you! Don't worry, I'll get you out of here. The boat! - Come on, Ali. - Yes. The raft, get back on the raft!! Daniel! Get on the boat, come on! - Oh God! - Old people first, I said. Come on, come on! Once you're over the fence the danger's gone. Come here, Minou. No, there isn't space for everyone. If you can swim, swim to the fence. Go on! Go on! Quickly! Climb over the nets, come on, quickly! We'll save everyone, there's no danger inside the fences. Come on! Come on! Quickly! Come on, quickly! Minou, Minou! - Get over the fence, quick. - My child! - What should we do? - Secure the raft and jump in. Minou! Where's Minou?!! She's with me. I'm over here. Stay in the water, we'll reach the shore somewhere else. - They'll get all of us here! - Lets get out of here!! We did it! Seems strange that no-one's about. Oh, my God. The Kuma think we were responsible for the god Kruna's reawakening, understand? Killing us is a way to send him away, and I should have been sacrificed to him as well. Lets try and reach the others. Lets take the workers' van. Right, lets go. Hide behind that boat. I'll make them follow me. Get in. Get in now! It's full of explosives! We only need one arrow to be blown sky high! Ali. - Ali. - Daniel. Lets go! My leg's stuck, I can't get out! Help me. Pull me out of here, Daniel! Please help me! There must be some aqualungs back there. Here, take it. I'll get another one. Ali. Ali, Daniel! Look, look! Helicopters! We're saved! Here we are! Here we are! Here we are! Here we are! Now she's got to stay with you! Ripped by: SkyFury
