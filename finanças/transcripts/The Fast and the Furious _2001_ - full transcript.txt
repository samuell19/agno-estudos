Every day, for the last three weeks, you've come here, asking how the tuna is. Now, it was crappy yesterday. lt was crappy the day before.

Brian, you're messing with my business. When Dominic drives, he's golden. Kids pour in. They want everything he has. Every performance part. They pay cash! -What did Dominic say? -You don't want to know. -What did Dominic say? -He wants you out of here. -He wants me out of here? -Yes. -And what did you say to Dom? -What do you think l said? l told him, "Good help is hard to find." Relax. l need NOS. -l need NOS. -No. My car topped out at 1 40 miles per hour, this morning. Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide. l've seen how you drive.

Am l worthy? -We don't know yet. But you're in. Let's go. -All right. -Let's go! -What the hell is going on around here? -Street's closed, pizza boy. -Find another way home. -Goddamn street racers.

You drive like you've done this before. Are you a wheelman? -No. -You boost cars? -No. Never. -Ever done time? Couple of overnighters. No big deal. What about the two years in juvie for boosting cars? Tucson, right? l had Jesse run a profile on you, Brian Earl Spilner. He'll find anything on the Web. Anything about anybody. So, why bullshit? So, what about you? Two years in Lompoc. l'll die before l go back. -Oh, great. -What? lt's going to be a long-ass night. That's what. Follow us. l thought we had an agreement.

They came in from every direction. lt was orchestrated. -This your beer? -Yeah, that's my beer. Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs. You can't detail a car with the cover on. -Can't even get that right. -You all right? -Am l all right? -lt was just a question. Yo, Dom. -Why did you bring the buster here? -'Cause he kept me out of handcuffs! He didn't just run back to the fort! The buster brought me back. You can have any brew you want, as long as it's a Corona. -Thanks, man. -That's Vince's. So, enjoy it. You. -Hey, bro. You got a bathroom? -Upstairs. First door on the right. He's got no call being up in here. You don't know that fool for shit. -He's right, Dom. -There was a time when l didn't know you. That was in the third grade! -Yeah.

You need to get some sleep. And you definitely, definitely need a shower. Come on. l'll take you home. (POLlCE SlREN BLARlNG) OFFICER: Show me your hands. Very good. Now open the door. Put your hands on your head. Behind your head. Face the front of the vehicle, walk backwards towards the rear. Take two steps to your right. Stop right there. -What did l do? -Shut up. He's clean, Sarge. Damn! Muse, will you take these things off? -Shit. You put them on so tight. -l like realism. You never know who's watching, Brian. Nice crib, Sergeant. lt's a lot nicer than the last place you confiscated. Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s. You see, even the cops are Hollywood in Hollywood. TANNER: Okay, here he is, fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven. That was an $80,000 vehicle, Officer. -You told him what happened? -TANNER: He knows. -Send the bill to Johnny Tran. -The kid's giving me attitude? lt doesn't speak well for police/FBl relations, Tanner. -l walk in the door and the guy's already... -All right, all right. We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it. Muse, why don't you make us four iced cappuccinos, please? -Come on. -Regular or decaf, Sarge? Decaf, l think. BlLKlNS: Four hijackings in two months, and we have nothing. The DVD players and digital cameras are worth $1 .2 million which brings the grand total to $6 million plus. TANNER: We're in the political crosshairs now, Brian. That's why you're undercover. BlLKlNS: You want that detective badge fast, kid. And you want to know something? The FBl can help, if you come through for us. What does the truck driver say? He gave us the same M.O.: Three Honda Civics, precision driving, the same green neon glow from under the chassis. Lab says the skidmarks came back the same: Mashamoto ZX tires. So, we know it's somebody in the street-racing world. lf we don't make this case, the truckers will take matters into their own hands. l tell them we're close. Are you going to make me a liar? Look, what do we know? We know this world revolves around Toretto, right? l'm not saying that he's the one that's popping these trucks, but l can guarantee he knows who is. lt's just a matter of time until l win... You want time, buy the magazine. We don't have time. Just get me something l can use. ls Harry cooperating? Like a guy that'll do time for receiving stolen property if he doesn't. What kind of vibe is he getting from Toretto? He's scared of him, but he doesn't think he's jacking trucks. -He's too controlled for that. -Wait. Not that l want to contradict Harry's fine judge of character, but Toretto did hard time for nearly beating a guy to death. He's got nitrous oxide in his blood and a gas tank for a brain. Do not turn your back on him. Tanner, l'm gonna need another car. -What about parts and service? -Hold off on it. Dom, l don't know what to do with it. All right, what the hell is this? What do you got there? -This is your car. -My car? l said a 1 0-second car, not a 1 0-minute car. You could push this across the finish line, or tow it. DOM: You couldn't even tow that across the finish line. No faith. l have faith in you, but this isn't a junkyard. -This is a garage. -Pop the hood. -Pop the hood? -Pop the hood. -2JZ engine. No shit. -And what did l tell you? -l retract my previous statement. -You know what? This will decimate all after you put about $1 5,000 in it. Or more, if we have to overnight parts from Japan. -We'll put it on my tab at Harry's. -Yes! l gotta get you racing again so l can make some money off your ass. There's a showdown in the desert called Race Wars. That's where you'll do it. When you're not working at Harry's, you're working here. lf you can't find the right tool in this garage, Mr. Arizona, you don't belong near a car. He owns you now. Tell me what you think about this. Koni adjustables. Gonna save us about 2 pounds. And they're gonna give us better traction for the hole shot. All right? This is your basic layout of the car. And that's pretty much what it could look like when it's finished. Red, green. -You should be going to MlT or something. -Yeah, right. No, l got that... What's it called? That attention disorder... -ADD? -Yes, that shit. Yeah. You know, l was good in algebra and like math and shit. Everything else l failed. Dropped out of school. l don't know. There's just something about engines that calms me down, you know. -l'm outta here. -Come on, dog. -Yo, Dom. -Vince, get over here and give us a hand. Looks like you got all the help you need, brother. -Mia! The chicken's dry. -MlA: All right. l'm coming out already. Here you go. Wait, hold up. Because you were the first to reach in to get the chicken, you say grace. -Dear heavenly... -Spirit. Spirit. Thank you. Thank you for providing us with a direct port nitrous injection, four core intercoolers and ball-bearing turbos and titanium valve springs. -Thank you. -Amen. -Not bad. -Amen. He was praying to the car gods, man. DOM: He's not the best. -MlA: What do you want? -Practice. Thank you, girl. Look who it is. "Old Coyotes 'R' Us." (CHUCKLES) l thought you weren't hungry, pumpkin. -You know, l gotta eat. -He's always hungry. All right, sit down. How you doing, Mia? Here you go. -Jesse, hand me that chicken. -Let's eat some grub, man. -Want some of that chicken? -What, you rent a movie or something? Need a hand with anything else? No, l'm good. You can go join the boys and watch the movie. -The cook doesn't clean where l come from. -l'd like to go there. -l think we should go out sometime. -No, l don't date my brother's friends. That sucks. -l'll have to kick his ass then. -l'd love to see that one. l would pay to see that one, actually. Wash my car when you get done. -What was that? -No, Mia. l'm talking to the punk. Wear your favorite dress, 'cause when you're done, l'm putting you on the street where you belong, cutie. ls this thing broken? What's wrong with this thing? What was that Cuban restaurant you wanted to take me to? The one with the picadillo and... -With red candles, wooden tables... -The plantain, food all over the place. -What it's called? -Cha Cha Cha. -Yeah, that's it. -Yeah. Well, you can take me there. Friday night at 1 0:00. ls that good for you? -Yeah, it's perfect. -Good. -There's no popcorn. -Make your own goddamn popcorn! All right. Now that's valet parking. -Harry. What's up, dog? -Nice to see you. Excellent. Come on in, man. -Check it. lt's yours. -Damn. What do we got here? -Hired some new help? -Don't even think about it. -What's up? -What's up, Brian? How you feeling? -Pretty good. What do you need? -What's up, man? l need you to hook me up. Three of everything. l made a list. Why don't you look that over? -When do you need this stuff by? -Tomorrow, today, now. -Right. -White boys work fast, don't they? (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) That's right. BRlAN: You said you need three of each? HECTOR: Yeah, three of everything. What do you think about that? Check this out. (SPANISH HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) He moans like a cop. Brian, this is one of those times you need to be clear about what you say. Nod if you understand me. Nod! Sit up. Tell me what the hell you're doing down here. (PANTlNG) Shit. What l'm doing? Dom. l owe you a 1 0-second car. And what this is about, this is about Race Wars. l just went in there, and Hector is gonna be running three Honda Civics with Spoon engines. And on top of that, he just came into Harry's and he ordered three T66 turbos, with NOS, and a MoTeC system exhaust. So, what are you saying? You're gonna check everybody's shit out, one garage after another? Yeah. Because, Dom, you know l can't lose again. He's a cop. He's a cop! You a cop? (PANTlNG) Let's go for a little ride. Walk! Okay. You stand watch. Yo, Dominic. There's no engines. What are they planning on racing with, hopes and dreams? l don't know, but they're sneaky as shit and they've got enough money to buy anything. (CELL PHONE RlNGlNG) What? We got a wolf pack. lt's Johnny Tran, and he's coming your way really fast. DOM: All right, we got company. Spilner. Come on. Move! JOHNNY: Let me ask you a question, Ted. -Do you see anything wrong here? -No. -We got no engines, do we? -No. -Do we? -No. A couple of Nissan SR20 motors will pull a premium -one week before Race Wars, huh? -Yeah, probably. You're a smart fence, Ted. Maybe too smart. What are you feeling, Lance? 40-weight? 50-weight? A 40-weight sounds nice. (TED GROANlNG) Where are they, Ted? -Where are they? -(MUFFLED) Enough! -Where are they? -They're in a warehouse. They're in a warehouse, man! (TED COUGHlNG AND GAGGlNG) JOHNNY: Ted. Kiss my shoes? Let's go get our engines. My superiors are flying in from D.C., in two days. l want something to show. We've got a fence with a lube hose in his mouth, automatic weapons, priors on every one of these Asian punks, a garage full of DVD players and generally psychotic behavior. Tell me why we shouldn't move on Tran now and figure it out later? Because all we have is behavior. Let me get hard evidence, because what we have now is just... BlLKlNS: What we have is probable cause. And truckers arming themselves for some good old-fashioned vigilante mayhem. -Tell us about Hector, Brian. -Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break. Hector's still working on the engines, but the tires don't match. Will somebody give me a cigarette? -Get him a cigarette. -Don't give him one. -l thought you quit. -l did. Just give me one. -Get him a cigarette. -No! Tell me about Toretto. l told you, l think he's too controlled for this. Going suicidal on semi-trucks? No way. Maybe Vince. But he's too dumb to do it. -l think the kid sister's blurring your vision. -What did you say? l don't blame you. l'd get off on her surveillance photos, too. Knock it off! What? Are you going native on me, Brian? Have you read Toretto's file lately? -Yeah. l memorized that file. -Read it again. No, better still, take a look at these. Remember l told you about the guy he nearly beat to death? Toretto did this with a three-quarter-inch torque wrench. He's a model of self-control. l need a few more days. JESSE: Got a TR7 here, with a ball-bearing upgrade. What it's going to do is, it's going to spool up really quick. -l got this set up for 24 psi. -Got it. You got big plans tonight? Yeah. We're going out to dinner. You break her heart, l'll break your neck. That's not gonna happen. l want to show you something. Wow! Me and my dad built her. Nine hundred horses of Detroit muscle. lt's a beast. -You know what she ran in Palmdale? -No. What? Nine seconds flat. -God. -My dad was driving. So much torque, the chassis twisted coming off the line. Barely kept her on the track. -So, what's your best time? -l've never driven her. Why not? lt scares the shit out of me. That's my dad. He was coming up in the pro stock-car circuit. Last race of the season. A guy named Kenny Linder came up from inside, in the final turn. He clipped his bumper and put him into the wall at 1 20. l watched my dad burn to death. l remembered hearing him scream. But the people that were there said he had died before the tanks blew. They said it was me who was screaming. l saw Linder about a week later. l had a wrench, and l hit him. And l didn't intend to keep hitting him, but when l finished, l couldn't lift my arm. He's a janitor at a high school. He has to take the bus to work every day. And they banned me from the tracks for life. l live my life a quarter mile at a time. Nothing else matters. Not the mortgage, not the store, not my team and all their bullshit. For those 1 0 seconds or less, l'm free. BRlAN: So, how is it, anyways, that the gang came to be? MlA: What? BRlAN: The gang. MlA: The gang? No, they don't call themselves a gang. BRlAN: What do they call themselves? MlA: They're a team. -They call themselves a team. -All right. How did the team come to be? Well, that's a whole lot of history. -l've got time. -Okay. Vince grew up with my brother. Actually, he didn't ever actually grow up, as you can tell. But they were friends as kids. And Letty, she just lived down the street. Always into cars, though. Ever since she was, like, 1 0 years old. So, naturally, you know, my brother always had her attention. -And then she turned 1 6... -And then she had Dom's attention. Yeah. lt's funny how that works, isn't it? Yeah. How does Jesse fit into the whole thing? Jesse. Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of showed up one night and never, ever left. lt's just the way my brother is, you know. Dom's like... He's like gravity. Everything just gets pulled to him. Even you. No. The only thing that pulled me in was you. Being friends with your brother is just a bonus. That's good. That's good. lt's nice to come first every once in a while. Want to go for a drive? (ENGlNE ROARlNG) (TlRES SQUEALlNG) (HORNS BLARlNG) (CELL PHONE RlNGlNG) -Yeah? -TANNER: The hijackers have hit again. Bilkins has decided that we're gonna move on Johnny Tran and his guys at 17:00. Unless you say otherwise. lf you agree, just say yes. -Yeah. -Who is that? lt's just a wrong number. BlLKlNS: Yes, sir. Yeah, l know, but... Yeah. Yes, sir. Yeah. l got it. The DVD players were purchased legally. All we've got are a couple of low-rent weapons charges and some outstanding speeding tickets. -So, they're out. -Yeah. Father bailed them out. ls this the kind of intelligence l can expect from you, O'Conner? -You're gonna put this on me? -l can put it on whoever l want to. -Perks of the job. -No, you can't put this on me... No, wait a minute. Let me tell you. l don't care if you have to aim at someone and blow your cover to smithereens. You've got 36 hours to crack this bastard or you might want to think about another career. lt's Toretto, Brian. lt always has been Toretto. Tran and Hector are... They're just fumes. l know you've been lying to me. My question is this: Have you been lying to yourself because you can't see past Mia? He won't go back to prison. Well, that's a choice he's going to have to make. There's all kinds of family, Brian. And that's a choice you're gonna have to make. LETTY: You ready for this? Nice car. What's the retail on one of those? More than you can afford, pal. Ferrari. (ENGlNE REVVlNG) Smoke him. DOM: So, what's wrong, Brian? Nothing, man, l'm fine. Come on. Obviously something's off. Look, l have my good days and bad days just like anybody else. Brian, don't lose that cool of yours. That's your meal ticket. My meal ticket? l can't pay for my own shrimp? l got the shrimp. No, that's one thing about me you don't understand. l don't take handouts. l earn my way, every step. l need something extra on the side, like you. What do you mean, like me? -What's that supposed to mean? -That's what l mean. -What does that mean, like me? -Don't try... l'm not stupid, all right? l know that there's no way you paid for all that shit you got under the hood... There's no way you paid for what's under the hood of those cars by doing tune-ups and selling groceries. Whatever it is you're in on, l want in on it, too. -Well, what is this? -Read it. -What is this for? -lt's directions. To Race Wars. We'll see how you go. Then we'll talk.

You should watch from the side. l wouldn't want to get exhaust on that pretty face. -Put your money where your mouth is. -l'll race you for that sweet little ass. You want ass, why don't you hit Hollywood Boulevard? You want an adrenaline rush, it'll be two large. Right here. Right now. What's it gonna be? You got it. (ENGlNES REVVlNG) "Another one bites the dust" Come on. What you got? See ya. -What's up? -Hey, what's up, Jesse? What's in your hand?
