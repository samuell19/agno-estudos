Kuo He got brain fracture due to shock Blood clots block his brain stem causing damage to the brain structure Only timely surgery to remove the clots can stop him from getting aphasia or hemiplegia or paralysis Or he winds up a vegetable What's the chance of success? About 50%, it's a big operation With you in such a state, I can't face your dad I We spoiled you from childhood I punished Kuo only for the wrongs of you two I thought of your daddy when I caned you That's why I spoiled you I didn't know I was wrong till now I know I shan't live long My only wish was that you... got married and settled down But you've come to your present state It's sad for an old man to watch a young one die Kuo's suffered heavy brain injury and you're half crippled Even when recovered, you'll get up to 50 years I brought you up, I watched you two like this What should I do now? What should I do now? Miss, come now You're ready to donate $10K for a temple Why won't you lend me money? Smile, have a pose How are you, Mr. Yang? How are you? Daddy, take it for charity OK Serious? Daddy, don't make fun of me Ladies & gentlemen, my plan has 4 purposes First... Come down, What a nuisance Back to your bed What's the matter with you? Stay still Open up escape! Where to? Ladies and gentlemen When I was a boy scout at 6 one good deed everyday has been my motto his temple is built for my daughter Li-chu Hope it will mark a good beginning and stimulate the new generation to contribute to worthy causes 1997 is not our deadline so long as we work hard for peace Yang Tung-hai Keep away Out of the way Yang Tung-hai, you are a beast I'll finish you off Let me go Mr. Yang, Miss Yang has an abortion Abortion? Stand aside Mr. Yang You mustn't move her till the ambulance comes Don't move her Daughter, don't be afraid No photos, please First defendant Lin Ting-yi, and 2nd defendant Yang Tung-hai are charged with masterminding 28 illegal smuggling cases and 5 premeditated murders in 1978-86 Given the seriousness of the case, they must be held in custody without bail Your Honour Yang Tung-hai is a prominent personage and an active Urban Councillor His detention may affect HK politics adversely Please allow him bail8 Your Honour $1M personnel plus $3M cash bail is granted His travel documents must be detained Mr. Yang, and confidence in today's hearing? Absolutely. HK law's absolutely just I'll submit to the Court's ruling Thank you Mr. Yang, Lin Ting-yi's your accomplice Why did he double-cross you? I must correct you, Lin's not my man He only works in one of my subsidiaries His behaviour is only an outburst of youthful energy So... Sorry, time's up Mr. Yang, please Mr. Yang, how do you feel now? Lin Ting-yi lost his parents at 11 and had no family education He joined the Yang Organization at 17 He was promoted to a salaried Director of 2 companies It shows he was bribed to get involved And he has no previous conviction The 2nd defendant got him involved Hope members of the public will decide prudently Would an urban councillor and the Chairman of 2 banks owning properties exceeding $500 million be interested in smuggling partnerships with one with a man worth only 1% of his assets? Evidence is the spirit of the HK law Even if the prosecution proves him guilty the evidence does not concern the defendant but the employees of his subsidiaries only How can a busy man like Mr. Yang has absolute control over the activities of all his men? So this can't prove the guilt of the defendant Hope you will reach a suitable verdict Chairman of the jury, please read the verdict Your Honour, the first defendant Lin is found guilty The 2nd defendant is found not guilty The Court now pronounces 1st defendant Lin Ting-yi guilty of premeditated murder and drug-trafficking A cruel crime like premeditated murder must be seriously punished Drug-trafficking erodes society To sentence the defendant according to common code will affect adversely future cases The Court now sentence the 1st defendant to death The 2nd defendant Yang lung-hai is not guilty The Court regrets any inconvenience caused to Mr. Yang during the period of hearing Mr. Yang is now acquitted Court dismissed Do you consider the verdict a fair one? As I said, the law is absolutely fait Look, here's your trusted man going wrong. What is your comment? I'm rather disappointed in today's youth I did my best to cultivate him He used the company's position for crimes I am absolutely disillusioned He deserves the sentence Would you ask for council reinstalment? That's all now, I'll meet the press later to have a good talk with you Don't Help! Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
