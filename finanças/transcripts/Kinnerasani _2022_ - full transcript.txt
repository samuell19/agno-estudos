They are the fatigue of writers. Sorry ma'am. Sorry. Kinnerasani I wrote this for you Lightning strikes outside. But I was looking at my newborn daughter so I could not see or hear anything. How beautiful she is! Maybe her mother must have been so beautiful 20 years ago. From today on my life mission is my daughter's smile. On page two I thought my daughter's smile was the mission of my life. But on the third page... I changed the mission of my life to kill my daughter. You have to read this story to know why. It was the most memorable night of my life My anger as well as the rain. - A little more... - Enough, Mom! Eat some more, honey. Come on, have dinner. Do not be in front of the baby! Daughter...

Be careful with him. Yesterday .. in your house last night... Chinnu... look .. tell me what is Dad thinking? Dad is planning to kill you and me, Mom. -what! - Yes, Mom. Dad thinks so too. He thinks no one will find the pistol in his jeep. Parvati, don't say stupid things! He's just a kid. He says whatever he wants to feel. We even found the person who gave you a pistol.

It's beautiful. I am the author of it. Are you really a writer? why do you ask? I'm like a writer, right? I do not mean that. The story is really very interesting. May I tell you a secret? This is not a fiction. Every letter in it is true. Where have you been all these days? Page 112. Don't you want to visit your family? Page 142. Why are you trying to kill your girlfriend's daughter? What kind of book do you read? With the book in front of you, you ask the writer all the questions ..! Can I ask the last question? Did you lose your temper with your daughter?

Venkat, we need to meet. You wanted to meet, right? Why are you silent? Venkat had a bad dream. I was really scared. You think too much about everything. I do not understand what happened to Venkat. What kind of anger was there 20 years ago.... Until today I saw the same anger.... Your father will never come back, Vedha. Don't worry. I'm talking about serious things here, and... What are you doing without paying attention to me? I'm finishing the conference work. Oh! keep up... The book your father wrote... Do you remember the one you published? Yes.

The culprit! Our department has been looking for him for the past three years. We found out he was in that house and I sent my constables to search. You beat them! How do you do that? - Really sir... -Please Venkat! Do not interfere with our investigation. How did you know he was there? Do you know how dangerous he is? what is your name? Vedha Vedha... Vedha! Oh my God! We need to save this girl. Who will save me? Let's go Venkat. We'll find him alone. Hello! That's the name of the six girls your father killed... Vedha. If you find a girl named Vedha... He stabs them in the throat and kills them. Now do you understand from whom God wants to save you ..? Why did you call us sir? Yes Venkat... Go and see. All right, I'll take care of it. His name is also Vedha. The other girls were killed in the same way... He killed her by stabbing her in the throat. Sorry to say. Even this murder could be your dad's thing. Be careful. Very carefully. Okay, Venkat? Take care of the pain Venkat. Right? Tell me Vedha. Sir... I'm really sad about gender. I'm looking forward to meeting him one more time. Do you want it now? It's because of me, sir, that this murder is happening. I can still hear Lingam crying. Please sir. He lives on the fourth floor of the same building. Go and meet him. Shock! He was shocked to see the body. It doesn't matter. Nothing to worry about. Thank you. Bye! It's not, Venkat... He spent some time with his family and friends to spend time with. Do not leave him alone. Get your luggage ready. Let's go to my place. - Hello! - Hello, ma'am. Is this talking Veda? - Yes. - Ma'am, good morning. This is Venkat Sir Jr. talking.

I have to meet families who have been devastated by my father. That would be a problem for me. Please try to understand me. -I can spend any amount... -Money is not an issue here. It's really a secret question. OK... Because you ask so much... Send me your mail. I'll send it through. Thank you sir. Today I surprised Lily in the classroom. Title of the day... Crime and Punishment. Children, today we discuss the recent amendments to the criminal law. - Please pay attention. A very important topic. - Stop it! What are you doing? Please pay attention. This is a very important topic. - Stop it! - Guys, be careful. Looks suspicious, sir. Hey sir here. We are in a classroom. Then why are you here? See you. Because of some inhumane act... -You know? - These rules have been amended. - I can't control myself when I see you. This is sexual harassment! There are major amendments... Occurred in the year 2018. - Then how can you punish me? Section 375. -Let me... -If a girl under 12 is raped The perpetrator was sentenced to 20 years in prison. What the hell ..! what the hell! What do you do? Hey! Article 375 is a definition of rape Not punishment. -you idiot! And Article 376... Define punishment. One more thing, Professor. The maximum penalty under the 2018 Amendment is death. Not 20 years. I'm done...! If a girl under the age of 12 is raped, she will not be sent to jail. Hang him until he dies. People are getting demonized day by day. If they are not severely punished, they will lose their fear of another thirty. This is the reason for these amendments, sir. Hey, his classes never make you a lawyer. Come on, I'll teach you... you idiot! You made me a fool in front of everyone. is it? Then what do you say to the work you did in class? Then what happened to the fear of being an idiot? What to do? I can not leave you baby! Did it complain to the police that he fell in love in the classroom! - Venkat, call you. -Yes? - Hello! - Venkat, you need to come see me. - Okay sir. I'm coming. - what! Venkat... Venkat! She is a lawyer in the Supreme Court. She was born in Goa. A week ago he went to Delhi for an important case. We checked all the CCTV footage. The last 10 days the car serviceman, the gardener, as well as the Aquaguard cleaners came. But two days later, when he returned home, no one came to see him. How did he poison her without them coming? What is the answer? Do you think that's suicide? A very strong woman... He is alone in such a big house. All her children have settled abroad. No chance. What happened Venkat? No... no holes. He was not injected with a needle. I can not find anything, sir. Tell me when the autopsy report arrives. I'll be back. Baby, that... I have a small case to solve... - You laughed! - Don't be too smart... ~ I'm going up a lot... while you're talking ~ I'm going up a lot when your lips are healing I'm going up a lot listening to your heartbeat ~ I'm going up a lot looking at how you breathe I want to fly with you I want to fly with you ~ That's right ~ ~ Oops ..! The whole night was spent talking to you hour after hour ~ නො I do not know why he talks all night...? ~ We have an idea of ​​something is a good thing to look for ~ යන්න Find things with me ~ Let's see the depths of the Atlantic Ocean ~ Let's go for a walk in the Amazon jungle ~ ~ Let's take the Titanic out ~ Let's make it more romantic Venkat and Lily both do it. Lily! what is your name ? Lily! Silly river... Add a single extra word, it's a big difference from a Telugu word .. Orphaned Boss I grew up in a Catholic orphanage .. I'm lucky they took care of me and gave me a name. OK! Even so .. Why don't you give me a nice name? The girl you love... that too for your life partner... You have a chance to give him a name. Most people do not get this luck! Let me think. Babyamma (baby)? Is Babamma good? Yankamma... (very bad) Yankamma... beautiful name. - Yankamma. We will make it permanent. -go to the hell! Hey! Hey, stop! The only memory I have of my mother is that she gave me a name. What if I call you by my mother's name? Vedha You don't like it? OK I'll look for another name. Hello world... I'm sick! From today... my name is Vedha. Vedha... Venkat's wife. My name is Vedha. Venkat's wife. My name is Vedha. Sir... Hello! I got something. Yes! African mushrooms. When they dissolve, they release toxins. He drank this water and died. He was the one who came to serve the Aquaguard. - Take him, we can break this case (bring counter-evidence). - All right. - All right. Bye Venkat. - Good night, sir. Hey, do you know I broke the case because you threw it like this...? I have to manage him somehow! Bo... How can you leave me alone? At least tell me where you are going, right? I mean... I got a hint, baby. You and your tips! Hey, why are you so frustrated? Are you home So what? I even told you a lot of times... Don't leave me alone like that. Baby, please... look at me I'm sorry! Venkat, please leave me alone. I will love you until my last breath !. I will love you until my last breath! Lily! Lily! Vedha! Venkat's wife. My name is Vedha! Venkat's wife. Sir...

Who are you Who are you Who are you, who am I? We are just piles of meat with emotions. If that hurts... we become beasts. We found a weapon in your bag. It fits the description of the forensic laboratory. The blood of weapons... Oi matches the blood of the murdered girl. Your fingerprints match the fingerprints on the weapon. So, you're the killer. Why did it take so long? I should have told you the same thing. Why did you kill him? Why did you kill him? - I thought she was my daughter. -what! I'm not going to stop looking for that girl until she's killed. The endless universe is... Anger, sir. I did not have time to confirm that he was angry. Can you please confirm whether it is my daughter or not....? If she is my daughter... This story stops here. or... I'm sorry. She killed him thinking she was his daughter! She killed him thinking she was his daughter! Leave me alone sir. I will kill it! How can you do that...? Sir let me go... I will kill him. Let me go! Let me go! Sir, he looks like a mental patient! I will kill him. Look at his smile! Asshole...! What is this? Tell him to keep quiet. Venkat... you are pushing your limits. We have to take him to court. You know the rules. do you understand? Everything in this world must have a limit. Even if angry... Or love! I also forgot that I was a law student... And I was against my ethics. I enlisted the help of a gang of thugs in Goa to free him from prison Are you a thug? In a place where not even the sun can reach... My heart is on fire. When a cloud comes and asks me about it My story makes them cry... Like a little leaf blowing in the wind. I do not know which direction to go. In what language is it written ..? How do I read what is written in my destiny...? Okay... hurry up. I'll give it in two days. Tell me, sir. How can I help you...? Who is this I take thousands of pictures sir. I don't remember everyone, do I? He killed someone very close to my heart. Go to him, I don't care how many people there are... Sir find out about him... Sir want to know the story of our village. Chief of Parvathipuram... The people of this village have a god... Raja Bhanu Chandra Sir. At a big ceremony when his daughter is getting married to Keshava... The groom died in a fire. If people catch something, put it down... This was due to the unfortunate fate of Madam Parvati... God's friend told him that he had raised an orphaned boy. He is a character like Lord Rama. A good writer. God had given her name that she was suitable for Madam Parvati .. His name is... Jayadev. let me... Marry him .. A devil entered Eyag's life. We had no idea about that then. Parvathi... Parvati and Keshava fell in love outside of marriage. And her baby grows inside Parvati. This angered Jayadev. Hello sir. Hello sir. But Jayadeva calmed down because of God's property and respect for him .. This whole land belongs to the gods sir Even that whole bit. At that moment, another turning point came in her life. In a world where land and sky meet. We meet in the jungle. Your heart is with me I will walk with you. I am somewhere in your heart. Hey... what's your name? These feelings are suppressed... Kinnerasani Arrest me in the prison of your embrace. Looking at you I see nothing else. My heart beats for you. Hey, I have a wish. We need to take a picture together If I miss you... it's like a memory. Madam Parvati gave birth to a girl. The whole village celebrated it. Except for one. We met by chance... You touched my heart I want to walk quietly with you in this forest. Even our loneliness loves us. Even death cannot separate us. I can not look at anything when I look at you. My father was the one who took a picture of them, sir. But he could not hide it from God. That's your level. I took him here. Be careful from here. Otherwise you will fall to the ground. I go hunting every summer... None of the birds in the forest escaped my eyes. do you understand? God! Is dead! God ! Not anymore.... Dad... Dad... Sir... Do you know how beautiful you are ..! Maybe your mother was so beautiful when she was born... Give my baby back. Give my baby back. Kinnerasani What do you say? Please let go. Why are you here? Go... Why are you talking like this? What happened? What happened? I even got a baby. When he asks his father, who am I going to show...? Because she gave birth to him without getting married... The people of the village call me by name. If you want me to marry you right here, right now. Will you marry me here? You married him in front of everyone in the village. But do you want to marry me in the same house...? Kinnera! As long as he lives... This child is called illegitimate .. And I'm just your mistress. Go, Deva. Village, daughter who thinks she is mine is not mine. But my daughter... No one can say she's my daughter. When they leave, these two become my family, right? Sir... This must have been a quick decision. If caught? No one knows how he got caught. But the police arrested Jayadev on a charge of attempted murder... The employee who gave him the pistol was also caught. The root cause of all this is Kinnerasani .... what? The villagers are angry... They burned Kinnerasani and his daughter trapped in his hut... God! Kinnera! They killed my Kinnear, sir! I will not let him live. Is anyone in that family still alive? Sir... The teacher said God's... Sir, my granddaughter was in Hyderabad six months ago. Hello, madam. I am Venkat. I warned him that day... That miracles often bring dangers. I do not understand you. Looking into someone's eyes for a few seconds... He can read their thoughts... I learned about Vedha. I found him and went to Hyderabad He can read the thoughts of someone who looks into his eyes So I have to control my thoughts. Go to him... I approached Veda. Venkat, you passed the lie detection test .. I approached him to find his father. I found his address through a constable named Lingam. Hi! - Sir, who brought you here? - Just a normal trip! May I come in? -please. - Thank you. Sit down, sir. I'll go get you some coffee. Sir, coffee. thank you! Where is Venkat? He's at a conference, sir. He is very talented. All right, sir. I just found out. I'm here to do a little formal investigation, Vedha. I need your support. -Test! -no no... That's a normal story. Tell me, sir. After Lingam's body fell in front of you... You're alone there. Did you see anyone suspicious around there? No sir. But... It's a suicide, isn't it? Let's say he committed suicide in the pain of losing his sister. But usually people who commit suicide... They put their faces in front and jump. But like Aamir Khan in Doom 3... Jumped behind the lingam style. Not only that... Looks like there was a fight over where to drink sex. I have great doubts about all of this. That's what I'm asking you. Do you remember when someone saw something suspicious...? No sir. One time Lingam fell in front of me... I called Venkat. His phone was busy. Then I fainted. I did not see the surroundings properly. Okay, that's right. One more thing. Watch this video. In that video you see... CCTV footage near Lingam's home. Watch out! Everyone rushes inside. But a man in a hoodie walks out. Veda? Veda? Do you remember anything? No sir. OK. No problem. Call me if you remember anything. Venkat declined my call that day. I found Venkat's hoodie that day. He knew everything about me .. I mean... Venkat is hiding something else from me. - Venkat. - Sir? What a presentation....! - You made us proud. I'm so happy! - Thank you. Thank you very much sir. -best wishes. - Thank you! - Bye, sir. I wanna go. - All right. Veda? Veda? Veda? Vedha... Veda? Venkat... I have been afraid of a lot of things since I was a kid. You are the little courage that got rid of all that fear. I'm afraid to say my name out loud. But now... I love my name. Yes. Even if I say my name out loud... I'm not afraid my dad will come to kill me. Because... You are by my side to save me. My name is Vedha. My name is Vedha. Vedha... Venkat's wife. My name is Vedha. I love you Venkat. Why are you doing all this Venkat? Looking into someone's eyes for a few seconds... I can read their thoughts... I've been sad about reading people's thoughts these days. But for the first time in my life I feel sad that I could not read the person I love. I failed! I failed! You are always a mystery to me! CI Sir was there when you were at the conference. Lingam, what happened to Venkat? Lingam died because of me Vedha. Sir! Are you here right now...? - Please sit down, sir. - Sit down, sit down. You're in pain, right? I just came to see .. The only family I had was my sister Sir. He... killed him in a terrible way, sir. I also lost someone close to me. Like he killed your sister... he's stabbed here. But I did not just sit at home and drink. I went to find it. 9866679679. The day I was looking forward to... You look familiar You tried to kill me, didn't you? In cabbage .. But why? You killed him, stabbed him here. you remember? I killed a lot of girls like that. Near Vasco da Gama .. Thank you! Thank you... Thank you so much! L love you! My name is Vedha... Why would I not kill someone for saying that? Do you want to kill your daughter, not your daughter...? He's right here. If you have the courage... kill him. My dad... he's dead! I have a slight doubt Lingam. Jayadev who died at my hands two days ago... How did he kill your sister yesterday? How? Did he do that? How...! I love my mom sir. He cared a lot about me growing up .. But the crazy girl killed my mom and gave birth to her! He orphaned me, sir. With age his madness increased even more. I put him in a separate room for him to commit suicide... My friends, relatives, the whole society looked at me sir.... How can I marry a madman in my house, sir? I can not live this lonely life sir. I can not! That's when I decided to get rid of him, sir. I had the right opportunity, sir. And I took it. I killed her. I killed my own sister sir. How could you do that...? Sir, what is the difference between you and me? I committed a murder and you did one. I killed a jerk. And you killed like a jungle .. There is a lot of difference between you and me. Venkat! What are you doing here? I'm not coming with you. I want to meet my dad. Your car is bleeding. Thank you! If the police saw a problem. Your father will not find you, Vedha. Don't worry.
