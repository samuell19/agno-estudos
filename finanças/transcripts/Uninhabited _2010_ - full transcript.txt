Stay with me. Come on man, hold on! Stay with me! Stay with me... - Let's go! - Quick! Hey. There is a ghost on this island. Ok. Have you read this? I skimmed through it. Her name is Coral. That's her grave over there. She was a young Torres island girl and she worked for tripangos back in the 20's. She lived here. One day, she was out on the reef collecting tripang, and she stepped on a stone fish. The poison started to kick in but she made it back to shore. And the guys from the company was waiting for her. They laughed at her... and they raped her. Seven men. There are seven notches on the wall in there. - She died. - Ok?! And since then, she's been taking out her revenge on all the guys who come here. - And you believe this? - Listen to this. "Coral has a knife. She uses it to cut tripang. She got angry last night. Jim." come on... are you serious? What? Do you think it's funny? Of course. "Waiting to see the ghost Coral I hope she gives me a headjob like she did with all the others... - Jesus! - And then...later on... Ok, here it comes. "Coral visited us last night, at least I think she did. Not sure if it was a dream. She was very beautiful, watched us all night. We tried to approach her, but she disappeared." - You really believe this stuff? - Yeah, I do. It makes sence. It doesn't makes no sense... does not make sense. Wh...everything that happened to us since we got here what happened last night with those guys why they left so suddenly Wh... What were they shooting at? They were shooting each other! Of course. No. Listen to me! "We're leaving.... Coral" - Listen! - Beth, I'm sorry. "Coarl fucked with Bobby last night (????) bad way... serious shit. Not sure if he'll make it" Okay, Beth, someone wrote this stuff here... just to mess with people like us, It's a joke. - No, they not messing with us. been happening to us since we landed 2 days ago stuff gone missing "A hole in our ti???, can't get off the island. Don't know how it happened. Here by ourselves." - Must be the ghost, huh? - What a crock! Ok. Some dickhead come here, thought it would be a good idea to put a journal toghether, scare some people so they have the whold island for themselves. That's what going on. And now, people just come here and added to it, you know? It's some big stupid joke. You know...look like they put the grave up and everything. Listen: "Hendo's gone, missing. Can't find him anywhere." "Searched the island all over." - I do not want to hear anymore. Please. "found blood" - Hey, please. - "A lot of blood." - Please! - "What the fuck is going on here"? Can we put it down? It's bothering me now, ok? "If you read this journal, and you're on this island there is' a ghost... here and she will kill you." "Get the fuck out of here fast." Wow. Wow, wow. Come on. It's 'ridiculous! She beginning worked up over this. It's horrible what happened to her. Yeah, if it happened. If it happened. - Don't touch me! - Babe! Fine. Harry, how do you want the fish done? Harry? Harry? What do you wanna do with the fish? Look, we just wrap it in foil and I'll fix it up. I'm sure she exists. I went to the shack and I heard somebody whimpering. Look, I heard someone like that too. And...Look, it was wind. - It wasn't wind. - Hey, come on! - I heard it! It was a person. - No. Ok, look. It would make more sense if it was some kind of reality TV show. You know, on this island it's all just a big, you know, like conspiracy thing...then... Didn't you see the drawings on the wall? Could be part of it, you know. No, no... I totaly understand why she want revenge. What? If somebody did something like that to me... You wanna kill innocent men? I'd be angry, yeah absolutely. Jesus Christ... That's how war starts, Beth. Cut it out! Cut it out! That girl was raped seven times and they laughed at her while they did it! Look how angry you just gotten. - That...that happened and no wait a second... - Imagine how angry she would be! That happened one hundred years ago, ok? A hundred years ago, and she's dead now. - So? - So... why are we fighting about that? Nothing ever dies. Things just reform. No, no, no, no. I can feel her. Okay, then. Look... if she's on this island and she's killing innocent men... what does that leave me then, huh? Where does that leave me. ...beautiful... "time to go..." "????." "Look at me..." "She will kill you, you're next " "Don't be a fool, leave right now... " "You will die if you don't get of this island..." "She is giving you the last rite, mate... " "Get out, get out!" Jesus! What is it? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Hey, come on. Come on. Look, look! Ok. We have to get of this island right now. Hey, Beth! Harry! "Oh, Coral... "Here,pull those legs apart, Oh, fucking right up...oh Christ What'? ...do you agian... What is this? What the hell is this? You like that? Or you don't like that? I'm sorry but I like that.
