Eat an apple or whatever, but just sit together at the same table. We still have fifteen minutes. There's nothing more than this. Mariana left a note last night "It doesn't make air". But I left the batteries out. Do your feet already hurt ? You are right but it's not possible anymore. We'll be outside in no time. And after that... A taxi for the lovely lady ? Can we go to Dogarilor Street ? You should have asked before getting in. - So you're not going. - No. Good evening, can you take me to Dogarilor Street ? - What number ? - 23. All right. Could you turn the music off ? The power button is broken. Then at least turn it down. Thank you. C'mon, idiot ! Motherfucker ! - Get up before you get hit by a car. - I've lost my earring. - Forget the fucking earring ! - Let me go ! What's wrong with you ? Hey ! Leave me alone ! You're in the middle of the road ! - It's not your business ! Get away ! - Is this your car ? Is this your car ? Wait, man ! Hey ! I took her car keys. If that moron gets behind the wheel she'll be blasted to pieces. She's looking for her earrings in the middle of the fucking road. - That can't be right. - How can it be right ? - Taking her keys, I mean. - Well, I know it's not but... Is she drunk ? Oh, she's slammed. I think she's out again. - Call the police. - I don't want to call the police. You took my keys. Who should I call to pick you up ? - Tell me who I should call ! - Or what, huh ? Or I'll bash your head against that car. Careful how you talk, I'm a college graduate ! Hey ! If you move, I'll crack your head, you stupid cunt. What the hell is wrong with everybody today ? - Your phone's ringing. - Yeah. Well, answer for fuck sake ! - Yes. - How are you ? I'm good. - Everything ok ? - Nothing happened. - What is it ? - Are you upset ? No, I'm not. Tell me. I was wondering when you'll be done tomorrow with the team building. Don't know. Why ? I was thinking about driving over there to pick you up. Yeah... Yeah. Isn't Alina's baptism tomorrow ? Don't do that. I'll see you when I get home. I'm in my room. We'll talk when I get home, ok ? I know. I do too. Come on, we'll talk when we see each other. Oh, come on ! You too. - Do you want a cigarette ? - I quit smoking. I figured that out. Shall we go ? Yeah, but I'd like to go somewhere else. - Great. - Take me to Obcina Mica... Obcina Mica it is. Government should not postpone exams due to vote on the legal definition of a family and teachers should not be given extra rest days. More on that in a moment. But first, the weather report. Holy Father... Thanks. Everything okay ? Can you wait for five more minutes ? Still don't want a cigarette ? AVAILABLE How much for staying here all night ? You must be joking. It won't cost a thing cause I'm not staying. It says here the rate is 17 lei per hour. There are six hours left so that means 100 lei. Great. You get an A+. But I won't stay. Why ? Because it's Saturday night and I can make three times as much. Fine. 300. Will that do ? 500 will do. Okay. Really ? I said it was ok, didn't I ? So it's ok. - Can I ask you something ? - Are you available ? - Good evening. - Good evening. Available ? No, I already have a client. Ah, Mrs. Damian, how wonderful. How are you ? - Good evening. - Good evening, Mrs. Damian. My wife, Anca, is about to give birth and we couldn't find any goddamn cab. We have to go to the maternity and I saw this cab, didn't know it was taken, but ... Sure. Where is she ? Upstairs. I'll go get her in a second. - And I'm available. - I'll be right back. - Should I take your luggage out ? - Put it in the trunk, please. - Good evening. - Good evening. Come on, Bunny, careful. Give me that. - Are you comfortable ? - Yes. - Should I put that in the trunk ? - No, I'll carry it. Are you going too ? Yes, I need to get to the train station. - You're sitting in the back ? - Yes. Thank you. How are you feeling, Bunny ? We were lucky with Mrs. Damian. Do you have enough room ? - Can you pull the seat forward ? - Sorry, I can't. It's stuck. - Please, let me be. - What's the matter, dear ? Mrs. Damian, is it true you're selling the apartment ? - What ? - I heard you were selling. So... are you ? Because if you are, the committee would like to weigh in. - Weigh in on what ? - On whoever will stay there. You know how it is. Only decent people live in our building. We don't want a gipsy or a jerk for a neighbor. Don't worry. You won't. Respect is very important, you know. We don't want delays on payments either. There must be communication and understanding, don't you think ? - Of course. - Well, there you go. - How's Mr. Damian ? - He's fine, thank you. Good to hear that. I used to see him more often, at least on TV. "Tasty multifruit yoghurt, yummy !" They're not showing that commercial anymore. Speaking of yoghurt, I wanted to ask Mr. Damian... Well, then wait and ask him personally. But since you're here, I'll ask you, if that's ok. There's this smell coming. Did you move the kitchen in the bathroom ? Kitchen in the bathroom ?! No, Mr. Popescu. This stench of fried meat comes from your flat, ...and this happens every day. How do you know it's coming from us ? Smell goes up, your flat is below ours... Makes sense, no ? When was the last time it smelled ? It wouldn't be a problem if we weren't expecting. Right, Ancuța ? The smell of fried meat makes her nauseous. - Right, Bunny ? - Not all the time. Not all the time... And mixed with bathroom smell... Mr. Popescu, we're vegetarians. And we haven't moved the kitchen to the bathroom. You haven't been cooking mushrooms either ? They smell like steak. - No mushrooms either. - It does come from somewhere. Andu, I feel like throwing up. Oh, my ! Should I stop ? - Do you want him to stop ? - No, but stop talking about food ! Yes, Bunny. Open the window just a bit. - Is it better ? - Yes, close it. I told Anca your flat was too quiet. We were hoping you'd have a baby as well, so we wouldn't feel bad when ours keeps on screaming. Hey, where are we ? We're driving on the back streets cause there are road works in the area. This whole city is a mess. In our neighbourhood... This door is stuck. I'll help you. - Good bye and thank you. - Don't worry about it. - And good luck. - Have a safe trip. - Money ! - Yes, Bunny ? - Give her the money. - Oh, Mrs. Damian, I haven't... - It's fine, don't worry. - Really ? Thank you. All retards have children. Cigarette ? - It's the last one. - I don't want it. When did you stop smoking ? Two years and five months. Officially. And how is it ? It's great. So did you move your kitchen in the bathroom ? We can skip small talk. For how long have you been a taxi driver ? About two months. It'll be two months tomorrow. And I'm loving it. - Really ? - Fuck no. I wanted to quit after the first month. Actually, after the first week. So many idiots. But I need the money. Is it that bad ? It's bad or I just don't like people at all. Then you have the wrong job. Maybe. What do you do for a living ? Human resources. So you like people. - And before being a taxi driver ? - Bartender. Now that job I liked. But after a while you get tired of everything. - Are you sorry ? - About quitting that job ? Yes and no. Anyways, taxi won't be on the menu for much longer. It drives me nuts. You come across all sorts of people. And today was shit too. I saw that. - This happened today ? - Yes. And I just had it fixed. And how was your day ? Same thing. Why won't you go home ? If I tell you now, what will we talk about in a couple of hours ? During my first week as a cab driver this lady got into my car and when we got to the destination, she told me to wait. She kept watching the building door and whenever it opened, she looked like a... what do you call that animal... - Meerkat. - Meer... that's right. She was pretty dumb. And she wasn't smoking. - So we waited and waited... - I'm listening. And then I asked her what we were waiting for. She said she didn't know. - Then I told her to go home. - Why ? Why wait ? If he was cheating on her, that was it. How do you know that ? I wasn't born yesterday. - How old are you ? - 29. - Already turned 29 ? - Perceptive. Not yet. And she told me to take her to church. Are churches open at night ? Who said it was night ? It's easy to judge people on a superficial level. I am probably cheated on as we speak, no ? What makes you think that ? Hey, don't be like that... I'm just trying to understand why you use clichés instead of thinking. You just don't know. I could have thought you were just another douche cab driver. But I would have missed the point, right ? You don't seem happy. What ? I mean, you don't seem happy, that's why I thought someone was cheating on you. Not to mention all this driving around. What if it's the other way around ? Well, that's not ok either. Ok it's not an option. Give me a cigarette. Great. The trick is to keep breathing. You don't say ! Why did you insist on me driving you ? I don't know. It's just the way I am. Let's see if someone comes out of my building. - So we're going ? - Yes. - Obcina Street ? - Obcina. Why ? That's how much it is. - Are you sure ? - I'm sure. Thank you. No need to get out, I can handle it. Have some cigarettes. - No. - Two, three ? Two. Thanks. And two ! The last one, with both arms... Right ! Left ! Strike ! Retreat ! Strike ! Eight. Ok. Seven. Six. Strike again ! Hold that fist position. Tight ! Tighter ! Strike, retreat ! Good ! Good ! Go a bit forward ! More ! More ! Good ! Eight, strike. Seven, strike. Six, strike. Five, good. Four, stretch your arm. Three, stretch your arm. Two. Easy. Right. Strike ! Are you okay ? Did something happen ? - How are you ? - I'm at my mum's. Do you still want to meet ? Yes. When ? Tonight. Now. Why did you change your mind ? Hello, grandma ! Hello. Hello. How are you doing ? I do as I always do. I had a bad day today. One of these days I'll sign off and join your grandad. Stop saying such nonsense. Are you unwell ? I might be. But I can croak and you still won't bother to phone. - And when I call, you don't answer. - Oh, give me a break ! So, how are you ? I've been doing some housework, washing laundry. One-eye Mary dropped by and brought some homemade wine. She drank two glasses all by herself. I gave her two slices of the house special. Have you baked a cake again ? No. There was some left from last week. - Andrei. - Hi. - Should I take my shoes off ? - If you want to. There are slippers over there. I've just arrived. I didn't get to do anything. - Get in, will you ? - I am. - Do you want something to drink ? - What have you got ? - There's wine, beer, coke, water. - Give me a beer. - Aren't you driving ? - One beer can't hurt. Seriously ? That's not what the law says. Well, if that's a problem... - No problem. I've got Tuborg. - It's fine. - Take a seat. - I will. We can't stay here over night. I wasn't going to stay anyway. - Is this your flat ? - Yes. Why ? I'm just curious how long you've had it. Why ? I have an apartment for sale and I'm checking the market. You have a nice view from up here. Yeah, it is. I've got it for quite some time. But you don't live here, do you ? You ask a lot of questions. Can I have that beer now ? - Do you want a glass ? - No, this is fine. Wait, don't drink. You never know what they've touched. Thanks. Aren't you drinking ? Someone has to be the responsible one. - And that's you. - Yes. I'm extremely responsible. I'll go get a glass of water. - Have a seat. - I will. You seem to really like blue. It's turquoise. How did you make up your mind ? To come here ? After you went silent on the app, I thought you were just a piece of thrash like all the others. I went to my mom's. Fortunately, she lives nearby. Yeah, sorry. What do you do for a living ? I'm a cop. - Really ? - Yeah. Don't I look like one ? - You look familiar. - I'm a traffic officer. I'm kidding. I work in a bank. And you ? I'm in the IT business. Cool. Did you go to work today ? Yeah. I'm taking a seat. And do you like what you do ? I like it and I think I'm good at what I do. I don't like this country though. - Why ? - I just... don't like the people. So why aren't you leaving ? With what you do, you could find another job abroad easily. Yeah, I worked abroad for four years. In Dublin. I don't feel like talking about it. What do you feel like talking about ? I don't know. You seem to be a decent person. Well, I think I am. Who knows about you ? Very few people do. That's good. I'm discreet too. Okay. Have you ever been in a relationship ? No, not really, I'm not the type. - Why not ? - I'm just not the type. You ? I want to, but here it's very difficult. And to find someone... It's full of crazy, deranged people. The kind everybody knows about. The beginning was nice. We worked for the same company. - Was he Irish or Romanian ? - Romanian. But it was complicated. Why was it complicated ? - Can I count on your discretion ? - Yes. But you don't have to tell me. I'll go grab a beer. It was complicated because he was married and his wife and children were here. - Did you clean your can, too ? - Of course. And he had to come home at least once every other weekend. - Sometimes I'd come with him. - Four years ? Yeah, so what ? Sounds very consuming. Not really. And did his wife put up with it for four years ? Didn't she insist on taking them to Dublin too ? She did, but my guy told her it was difficult, that the company wouldn't pay for it. And the kids were already in school in Romania. - He got her going. - What about the holidays ? I suppose they had to spend the holidays together ? Sure, but he'd take me along. "Daddy's best friend", that's how the kids called me. They liked me a lot. Sometimes I was dreaming about them being my children. And the wife didn't suspect anything ? Maybe she did, maybe she didn't... I have no idea. Maybe it was better for her too. And why did you break up ? It was just over because he started going crazy. The stress... I don't know. - He just turned full Romanian. - Meaning ? He started saying I was misguiding him, that I'm stalling his career. Shit like that, every time he came back from his family. Romania. - Come on... - What else ? I don't know, maybe it was something else. Like what ? I don't know... someone else. You mean another guy. A friend told me the same thing but I would have noticed. This world is small. But 6 months after he came back to Romania, he got a divorce. - And ? - And what ? - Did he look for you ? - No... The best thing is that now... He's with a woman 15 years younger. And she's pregnant. But... is this guy good-looking ? Not really. I don't know, I guess... Got it. Tell me something about yourself. I've done all the talking. There's not much to tell... And I really like this country... Really ? What do you like about it ? The fact that I understand everything you're saying. You don't speak any foreign language ? I didn't mean that. The fact that I understand all the subtleties, everything. You don't sound like someone who works at a bank. How does a guy like that sound ? More... I don't know. Want something to eat ? No, thanks, that's not why I'm here. Why are you here then ? Do you have anything good to eat ? My mother gave me some koliva (funeral wheat cake). Do you want some ? Got me there. Yes, I do. - For real ? - I'm really mad about it. - Is this enough ? - Yes. Who's it for ? - My father. - I'm sorry. - When did he die ? - Four years ago. - Before you went to Dublin ? - Yes, before. - Do you have any siblings ? - No, why ? I was just curious. Let me get you a napkin. It's good. What is it ? I like talking to you. I don't often meet guys I can talk with. You like it ? The koliva ? Yes, may God rest his soul. Amen. Checking Grindr ? Busted. I was checking your profile. Why ? I forgot your position. I'm a banker. I'm top. You ? You didn't check ? No, I usually check the height. And ? How is it ? It's great. Finish up that koliva. I'm going to the bathroom to get ready, then maybe we can do something. Sure. How did that saying go ? Shitty times, great koliva. What's shitty ? Nothing, I was being stupid. Go to the bathroom. It will take a while. When you're done, go to the bedroom. - How are you ? - I'm fine. I don't know if I told you, but I don't kiss. - OK. Why ? - I don't like it. - And you've never wondered why ? - No. You've never kissed a guy before ? Rarely. When I'm in a relationship. I don't really like it. - And women ? - Women, yes. OK, and what's the difference ? What's the difference ? Are you blind ? I'm not, I just find it strange. What ? I like your arms. - Do you go to the gym ? - From time to time. I like your pecs too. Now I want to kiss you just because I know I can't. Tough luck. Shall we go on ? Wait, I don't want to get my shirt all wrinkled. It would have been nice to let me do it. - You want me to put it back on ? - No, it's OK. - You have no body hair ? - I do, but less than you. - Is that a problem ? - No. But please leave your clothes on. It turns me on. And put your socks back on. White ones would have been even better. Or if you had come dressed in a suit. - Why have you turned it off ? - It's better this way. Says who ? I like to see. Indulge me, at least until I'm a bit more relaxed. C'mon ! Wait, wait, wait... - What kind of light is this ? - Just this... - What is it ? - I don't know, it's a bit too much... - Come on, be a good boy. - A good boy ? Come here beside me. Get on top of me. Man, it's big. You're gonna rip me in two. - Is it bad ? - Not at all. Just be careful when you go in... Do you have a condom ? Hope it's big enough for you. God, I'm horny. Got it on ? This condom is straight out of Snow White. What do you mean ? - Do you have any lube ? - No. - It's gonna hurt. - I'll handle it. No, no, no... your work's down there. Are you clean ? You mean virus-free ? Yes, I am. - When did you last get tested ? - A month ago. And how many have you fucked since then ? We should have talked about it before. - Wait. Tell me. - I haven't fucked anyone. I want to do it bare. Good thing you're not kissing. - Come on, please. - Why ? It's a phantasy of mine. And you're the first guy I feel I can do it with. - No. - Please. What's the point ? The point is... Do it for me. Give it to me. Wait, wait... Fuck, I've come... Fuck it... - Are you serious ? - Yes. Can't you tell ? It happens... - I suppose you can't go on, right ? - Not really. - You want to come too ? - I don't have to. Come on. Does it take long ? Done. If you want to come too, you need to focus. Next time. As you wish. Please, let's leave the apartment separately. You mean I should leave now ? I didn't say that, I said separately. And if we meet in the street or anywhere else let me say "Hi !" first. The same with texts and phone calls. I'm in a relationship. - Are you serious ? - Absolutely. I don't have your number. And about the relationship, you could have told me beforehand. You didn't ask. - I don't even know your name. - You can call me Alex. I can call anyone Alex. True. Shall we ? How are you ? I'm good. Everything ok ? Nothing happened. What is it ? Are you upset ? No, I'm not. I was wondering when you are done with the team building tomorrow. Don't know. Why ? I was thinking about driving over there to pick you up. So we can spend some time together. Can you hear me ? - Did you hear what I said ? - Yeah... So you don't want me to come. Isn't Alina's baptism tomorrow ? I do, but I can say that something came up. That grandma is feeling ill or something. They're your friends, anyway. Don't do that. I'll see you when I get home. Where are you now ? I'm in my room. I miss you very much, you know. I couldn't concentrate on anything today. I love you and I want to be as I should. For you. I know. I do too. Come on, we'll talk when I get home. So we can't talk until then ? Oh, come on ! Ok. Take care. You too. MONSTERS. Left or right ? Left. What time does it start ? The church ceremony at 12.30 and the party at 2pm. But I said I couldn't make it to the restaurant. Did you ? I said I wasn't sure. - That I wanted to, but I wasn't sure. - So you didn't tell them. I'll tell them when I get to the church. - Will you come ? - No. Do you want some juice ? - Won't you trim your beard ? - What's wrong with it ? Nothing. It just looks unkempt. I don't think so. What is it ? What would you say if I told you that I fucked Vlad Stanciu ? The husband of "two piece suit" ? So are you coming or not ? At least tell me how you feel. Nausea. So ? Give me ten minutes to take a shower. - How much ? - 607 lei. The jerks ! - Hello. - Hello there. How are you ? Has your wife given birth ? Yes. We have a baby girl. Flavia Clara. - How nice. - Congratulations. Thank you. I'm the happiest daddy in the world. Don't pull, it's already going up. - And how are you ? - Fine, thank you. - You never left. - Yes, I did. - Is your wife ok ? - Yes, thank god. She was in labor for quite some time. But now she's fine. - So you're already back. - Yes, I am. So soon ? Where did you travel to ? - Not far. - Indeed. Did your wife tell you I wanted to talk to you ? She did. I finally know where the smell is coming from. We need to do something about Iliescu, it can't go on like this. Surely you've seen how much he... Hello ! Please, go ahead. You must be in a hurry. Oh, but there's enough room. - The space is too tight. - We can manage, I'm sure. You go on, we'll wait. - I had forgotten about this jerk. - Shut up. - What was he on about ? - Ignore him. Let's take this one. - Did you find them ? - No. We should go. I'd like to stay a little longer. Because we're selling it tomorrow, that's why. - What day is today ? - Sunday. The 6th. I feel Popescu made you angrier than I did. You're wrong. Let's go. - Hello there. - Good to see you. - Congratulations ! - Thanks ! How are you ? Nervous ? By the time you have the second child you go all numb. I don't believe you. It's mostly a matter of good organizing skills. The others are late. - Did you guys come by car ? - Yes. Can you bring Alina's brother, his wife and kid to the restaurant ? Sure. Will do that. I was hoping there would be more of us but... Don't worry about it. I have to go back, they're throwing her in the water. - I'll come with you at grandma's. - Are you sure ? On June 15th. - The 15th ? - Yes. Lucky guy. - Why lucky? - It's less hot. I remember how it was. I'll just roll around like a watermelon. - When are you due ? - The beginning of September. I'll be able to take my kid for walks in the park. It'll be cooler, the sunlight won't be as strong... Yeah, I remember going out wrapped up in warm clothes. I gave birth towards the end of the month. October is different... At least you don't have to stay in all summer with the AC on. But can you go outside with the baby so soon ? - After a week or ten days. - When are you due ? Can I play a song ? Thanks. Thanks. Come on. Come. What are you doing ? How is it ? How are you ? As usual. Breathe ! There's still time to change your mind. Stop stressing me out. It's going to be ok. We should call and tell her you're coming too. - So that she won't be frightened. - You never know. Call her then. - What are you looking for ? - The remote control. Shouldn't you go help her ? Come on, tell me how I can help. - Why are you here ? - To help. I don't need help. Go back to the dining room. - Why have you sliced so much bread ? - Dana ! Haven't you taught your man not to interfere with a woman in the kitchen ? She can't say now I'm ignoring her. Take the bread and go to the dining room. And shut the door, so you don't faint because of the smell. If you don't want to be like the rest, that's fine with me, I understand. Great ! See, Dana ? She understands. If you stack them, I'll have to wash both sides. - You wouldn't otherwise ? - I would, but... anyways. You still have me, someone who makes you two feel young. - But afterwards ? - Are you threatening us again ? - You'll see when I'm gone. - What ? Tell me what we're going to see. Things end when you least expect them to. Today you're here, tomorrow you're gone. A child is the only certainty you can cling to. At least you know it's yours, not like... You're really something ! Old age isn't for everyone. I can stand for a lot but I know what I'm talking about. I bet ! I'll tell you something that will cheer you up. I'm almost afraid to hear it ! Yes, exactly. So he took her out to dinner. The guy was 20 years her junior, you see. They went to a fancy restaurant, drank champagne... And at some point into the evening the guy asks: "Have you thought about selling the apartment ?" The gipsy had his eye on that nice big apartment. It's in a good residential area, she's old so he would have struck gold with it. But she's no idiot. She figured out what he was up to and dumped him immediately. - I didn't understand a thing. - You're dumb. Stop patronizing me. What I'm trying to say is that having a child changes everything. You won't fall in the claws of some scoundrel who even tries to cheat you out of your cemetery lot. When I had your mum and Adi, I felt that I had a reason to live. Mother said you never spent much time with them. You sent them away and she had to look after Adi. She's even dumber than you. I sent them away so I could make money. So they wouldn't want for anything. If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. Mum said she got her first doll at seventeen. Arthur, stop it. Dana, why on earth is it so difficult to have a baby ? I'll look after him if you are too busy. We can't have a baby just to make you happy. See ? Quiet as a lamb. - Grandma, enough ! - I don't understand this woman. How can she be this selfish ? - She's not selfish. - Really ? - I don't want to talk about this. - Andrei, life is short. If she can't bear children, have one with another woman and raise him together. Listen to me for once. Would you do it ? - What ? - Raise another woman's child. Maybe I would, or maybe I wouldn't. I had my own. Come on, grandma ! How can you say such nonsense ? Are you drunk ? How dare you speak like that ! Now you're calling me a drunk ?! And even if I wanted to drink, I'm within my right. I'm in my own house. - Can I take the table cloth ? - No. You've done enough already ! Very well ! Arthur, I'd like to leave now. Good God ! What kind of people are you ? What kind are we ? Enough ! I'm tired of your sarcasm ! I don't even know why you came. You're sending me to an early grave ! It's the least we can do ! She doesn't say much, but when she does... Why are you laughing ? Am I not allowed ? Is this how you act in your own home ? Meaning ? Dana, be careful how you address me. Fair enough ! But then let me tell you why we're not having a baby. Please do ! - Dana, let's all calm down, shall we ? - I am calm. But this woman has the right to know. "This woman" ? Now I'm "this woman" ! - Dana ! - Relax ! I'm not having a baby because I have nothing to offer but insecurity. - What a philosopher ! - And fear ! Can you understand that ? Can you ? What is the point ? The point is to have it for yourself. I don't need a child. Do you ? - Do you ? - I don't know. So you do ! How are you ? I came here too yesterday. I went to see Cristi. When you called, I knew something was wrong. Why did you go to him ? I don't know. I got to the apartment building and then... I couldn't. I met with him. When ? Then. Two years ago. When you told me about the two of you. I wanted to see him. To see how someone you love was like. Why are you doing this ? - What ? - What you're doing right now. Why ? I decided then to be with you no matter what. - Why did you stay with me ? - But you ? Why did you stay with me ? Why are you staying with me ? MONSTERS
