"As now Moses saw that the people were naked, "for Aaron when he raised them up had made them naked to their shame, "he stood at the gate of the camp and spoke: 'Here to me who belongs to the Lord.' "Then all the sons of Levi gathered themselves to him, and he spoke to them: ""Thus speaks the Lord God of Israel, bind each one his sword at his side "and go back and forth through the camp from one gate to the other "and slay each other one his brother, friend and neighbor.' "The sons of Levi did as Moses had said to them, "and there fell that day "of the people three thousand men."‚Äù MOSES AND AARON Opera in three acts Pate I 1. The Calling of Moses Unique Eternal Omnipresent Invisible And unrepresentable God! Put off thy shoes Thou hast gone far enough Thou standest on holy ground God of my fathers God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob Thou who hast reawakened their idea in me My God, do not oblige me To proclaim it I am old Let me In rest to pasture my sheep Thou hast seen the abominations Known the truth Thou canst otherwise no more Thou must free thy people Who am I To set myself against the might of blindness? Bound to the unique God United with thee Divided from Pharaoh What will testify to the people of my mandate? The Name of the Unique! The Eternal will free it That it no longer serve the perishable Nobody will believe me! Before their ears thou wilt do wonders Their eyes will acknowledge them From thy staff will they hear Will wonder at thy cleverness From thy hand will believe in thy power From the Nile water will feel what Is commanded to their blood My tongue is not flexible I can think But not speak As from this thorn bush Dark ere the light of truth fell upon it So wilt thou perceive my voice From everything Aaron will I enlighten He shall be thy mouth From him shall thy voice speak As from thee mine! And you will be blessed For this I promise thee This people is chosen before all peoples To be the people of the unique God That they may know him And devote themselves to him alone That they may endure all the trials to which In millennia the idea is exposed And this I swear to thee I will lead you thither Where you will be united with the Eternal And to all peoples A model And now go! Thou wilt meet Aaron in the desert He comes upon thee on the way Thereby shalt thou know him Proclaim! 2. Moses encounters Aaron in the desert Thou, son of my fathers Thou, son of my father, brother of the spirit, from whom the Unique will speak: perceive me and him, and say what thou understandest. My brother, did the Almighty Give me to thee as a vessel To pour out over our brothers The grace of the Eternal? Happy people To belong to a unique God Others exist only in man, only in the representation. In it the Omnipresent has no room. Imagination of the highest fantasy No image can give thee an image of the Unrepresentable People, chosen, to know the Invisible... ...10 think the Unrepresentable. Chosen people, eternally to love a unique God With a thousand times more Love than all the other peoples Love their many gods Invisible Unrepresentable! People, chosen for the Unique Canst thou love What thou darest not represent thyself? Unrepresentable, because invisible, because incommensurable, because unending, because eternal, because omnipresent, because almighty. Only One IS almighty. Thou punishest the sins of the fathers On the children and the children's children Dost thou punish? Are we capable of causing what obliges thee to consequences? Thou rewardest those who obey thy commandments Righteous God, thou hast directed joy, everything shall happen. Is a reward owed to him who would gladly otherwise? Or to him who is not able to do otherwise? Thou hearest the prayers of the poor Almighty God, thee did purchase the offerings of the poor, whom thou hast made poor? Purify thy thinking Loose it from the worthless Dedicate it to the true No other gain thanks thy offering. Only an almighty God Could choose such a weak Humiliated people To show in them his almightiness His wonders To teach them To believe in him alone The inexorable law of thought compels to fulfillment. Almighty! Be the God of this people! Free it from Pharaoh's servitude! 3. Moses and Aaron proclaim to the people the message of God I have seen him as a fiery flame sprang up, which was calling him! He threw himself on his knees and hid his face in the sand Then he went into the desert He just passed by my house like a luminous cloud He floated more than he walked Scarcely did his foot touch the way And quickly he vanished from my eyes I questioned him But he did not heed me, ran on And still I heard A God had commanded him To meet his brother Moses In the desert Moses? He who slaughtered the taskmaster? Moses! He fled! Overtook the wrath of Pharaoh! Is he coming back to stir up revolt? Bound with a new God! A new God, new offerings He will protect us The old gods Have also protected If the one didn't We turned to the other One cannot demand the impossible from the gods either The new God Perhaps he is stronger than Pharaoh? Stronger than our gods? The other gods help only the oppressors This is the God who will help us If one should judge him by this Moses Then he will require blood offerings The new God won't help us either Blaspheme not! There are Gods who only punish And those who only reward Blood offerings! Many must be reconciled often Others can be won over lastingly If he helps us If he protects us against the servants of Pharaoh and against his false Gods He shall be our God God of the children of Israel whom we serve To whom we make offering Do not believe the beguilers! He will free us! The Gods love us not! We want to love him! Who is it that wants to be stronger than Pharaoh's god? We want to make him offerings! Leave us in peace! Back to work! Lest it become still heavier! He will free us! See Moses and Aaron! See Aaron and Moses! Is Moses standing or is he going? Moses is standing! No, he is walking slowly! Mighty his white head Violent his arm! Aaron, certainly no longer young Hastens winged, on a light step Far ahead of him and yet near him They are nearer, are farther They are not moving in space Are nearer, are farther Are higher, are deeper Vanish completely See Moses, see Aaron They are now there! Do you bring hearing Message of the new God? Does he send you to us as leaders to new hope? Gladly will we offer up gold Goods and life to him! Self love compels us, drives us to give ourselves to him Not only for the prospect of grace Giving itself is voluptuousness Is highest grace! The Unique, Eternal, Almighty, Omnipresent... He has chosen you Before all peoples ...demands no offering from you: he wants not a part, he requires the whole. And will give to you alone his whole grace Throw yourselves down to adore him! Adore? Whom? Where is he? I see him not! Does he look good or evil? Shall we love or fear him? Show him to us! Then will we kneel Then will we drag cattle here And gold and grain and wine! All shall your God receive If we are his people If he protects us If he is our God But where is he? Show him to us! Close your eyes Stop up your ears! Only thus can you see And hear him! No living man sees Or hears him otherwise! IS he never to be seen? Eternally invisible? What? Thy almighty God cannot make himself visible to us? The righteous man sees him I saw his glow! Then the murderer Need not fear him Who sees him not is lost! Then are we all lost for we see him not! Stay far from us with thy God With the Almighty! We do not want to be freed through him! Stay as far from us as thy God The Omnipresent! We fear and love him not! As little as he rewards and punishes us! We do not want to be freed through him! Almighty My power is at an end My idea is impotent In Aaron's word! Be silent! The word am I and the deed! Aaron, what dost thou? What does thou, Aaron? This staff leads you See, the serpent! Flee! The serpent is growing! It is twisting! See! It is turning against everyone! In Moses' hand a rigid staff The law In my hand The moving serpent Cleverness Place yourselves so as it compels you! Away, draw back! Come over here, go there! Divide yourselves better! In vain, it holds us in its spell! Know the might That his staff Imparts to the leader! A wonder fills us with terror The staff which changes into a serpent Shows Aaron as master of this people Is Aaron the servant of this Moses And Moses the servant of his God So must it be a mighty God Since mighty servants serve him! He will free us! We want to serve him! We want to make him offering! Thy staff compels us Yet it does not compel Pharaoh to let us free! Your courage is broken Your pride vanished Without hope you serve and believe Neither in yourselves nor in God Your heart is sick! Thus will you not compel Pharaoh! Strong is Pharaoh! Weak are we! See Moses' hand Healthy is it and strong But Moses' heart is like yours now Because he knows you are weak And without courage If he leads his hand to his heart Which is sick, like yours, see! Leprosy! Flee! Keep away from him! Don't touch him You will be sick! Know yourselves therein Without courage Sick Despised Enslaved Persecuted! But now dwells in Moses' bosom The spirit of the strong God Who compels Pharaoh to abolish forced taskwork See! Leads Moses now to this strong heart The leprous, sick hand Wonder! Healthy is the hand and strong! Know yourselves also therein Your courage will vanquish Pharaoh! Through Aaron Moses lets us see How he himself has beheld his God Leprous the hand of the unbeliever Healthy the heart of him who trusts God Thus this God becomes representable to us The symbol expands itself to the image The heart believes full of courage in a God Whom visible wonders attest Through Aaron Moses lets us see How he himself has beheld his God Thus this God becomes representable whom visible wonders attest Almighty God! All for freedom! Let us break the chains! Slaughter the taskmasters! Slaughter their priests! Destroy their Gods! Off into the desert! Mad men! Whereof shall the desert nourish you? In the desert The purity of thought will nourish you Preserve and develop you And the Eternal lets you see an image Of your physical happiness In every spiritual wonder The All-knowing knows that you are a people of children And does not expect from children what is difficult for grown-ups He reckons with this That all children mature And all old men become wise He gives you time to dedicate your life in joy To the preparation For the wisdom of age He will not let you lack for food even in the desert The Almighty changes Sand into fruit Fruit into gold Gold into delight Delight into spirit Who feeds the Nile That nourishes this land? He who changes the staff into the serpent Health into leprosy See the Nile water In this jar No, you are not mistaken What you now see is blood! Do you understand that? It Is your blood That nourishes this land Like the water of the Nile Fat are you making the servants of lies Of the false Gods Yes, the Almighty frees you And your blood He has chosen you Before all peoples To be the people of the unique God To serve him alone No one else"s servant! You will be free from task and plague! This he promises you He will lead you into the land Where milk and honey flows And you shall enjoy physically What was sworn to your fathers spiritually Yet what remains for Pharaoh See here Is again the clear water of the Nile And therein will he sink down! He has chosen us Before all peoples To serve him alone No one else's servant We shall be free from task and plague! This he promises us He will lead us into the land Where milk and honey flows And we shall enjoy What he swore to our fathers Almighty, thou art stronger than the Gods of Egypt Pharaoh and his servants dost thou strike down From forced taskwork Moses and Aaron free us Eternal God, we serve thee We consecrate to thee our offerings and our love Thou hast chosen us Leadst us into the promised land We shall be free, free, free! Act ll Before the Mountain of Revelation Where is Moses? Where Is the leader? For a long time already no one has seen him! Never will he return! Where is his God? Where is the Eternal? Forty days! Forty days we have already been here! How long shall this still last? Forty days now have we been waiting for Moses And still no one knows rule nor law Unrepresentable law of the unrepresentable God! Juda always occupies the best pastures! Harsher than Egypt To forced taskwork without day of rest Ephraim compels Benjamin's sons! Benjamin's sons Have raped Ephraim's women! Violence reigns! Unruliness knows not its punishment Virtue not its reward! Forty days have we been waiting in vain Before this height! When Moses comes down From this height Where to him alone The law Is revealed Shall my mouth transmit to you Rule and law Do not expect the form Before the idea! But at the same time It will be there! That will come too late! The people are desperate! They mistrust this height Whose fence cuts them off from the Mountain of Revelation They rage They believe none of us any longer Hold the fence as arbitrary The revelation as subterfuge Moses' silence as flight! Hear! Hear! Too late! Where is Moses? That we tear him to pieces! Where is the Omnipresent? That he looks on at it Where is the Almighty? That he hinders us from it! Fear nothing! Tear him to pieces! The Unrepresentable has not forbidden it! Give us back our gods That they create order! Or we will tear you to pieces Who have taken from us law and rule! Aaron, help us! Speak to them! They will murder us! Thee, will they hear! Thou hast their heart! People of Israel! My brother Moses remains Where he always is Whether he be near or far from us He remains on this height By his God Perhaps he has forsaken us He who was far from us Perhaps his God has forsaken him To whom he was near Perhaps he came too near to him! It is a stern God Perhaps he has killed him! His God has killed him! The gods have killed him! The strong Gods annihilate RN RN The Invisible gives help to no one! The Eternal could not protect him! The Invisible lets himself be glimpsed nowhere! His God is impotent! Slaughter them, burn them The priests of this false God! Aaron Help us Give in! People of Israel! Thy gods I give back to thee And thee to them As Is thy desire Leave the far away To the Eternal! To your measure are gods Of a present, everyday substance You contribute this material I give it such a form Everyday, visible, graspable Eternalized in gold Bring gold hither! Make offerings! Call him forth! You shall become happy! Their physical visibility Presence Guarantees our security! Their limits and measurability Do not require what is denied to our feeling Gods Near to our feelings, Gods Whom we wholly comprehend Let felicity award virtue Let justice punish misdeed Showing the consequences of our deeds Gods, your might displays itself Be joyful, Israel, rejoice, Israel! Colorful is this present Dismal is that eternity Life's pleasure shuns not its end Fearless it seeks it willingly Pleasure borders on life and on death Intensifies to the latter by the former Threat inflames the courage to live Steadfastness and bravery To thy Gods as substance thou gavest thy inmost, thy feeling for life Thy Gods' aspect is assured by thy gold, divest thyself of it! Make thyself poor Make them rich! They will not let thee hunger! Be joyful, Israel! This image attests that in everything that is, a god lives! Unchangeable, like a principle Is the material, the gold which you have given Seemingly changeable like everything is Secondary, is the shape which I gave it Revere yourselves in this symbol! O image of the Gods Thou dost radiate, dost warm Dost heal As never the sun did heal I merely lay my finger on thee And already the crippled limbs move Here, O Gods Take the last rags That have protected us from the sun's glare And the desert's dust And here the last morsels That we have begged for tomorrow The last moments That we have still to live Take them as offering They have killed themselves! Free under its own masters A people submits itself only to gods Who rule powerfully Princes of the tribes Pay homage with me To this image of regulated powers! In the name of all the tribes lead by us Gods, see us before you on our knees The higher might submitted to the highest Free under our own masters! High as the idea were we raised up Far from the present Near to the future! Deep as life are we lowered deep as life Smashed be this image of the temporal! Pure be the outlook upon eternity! Here, look now upon eternity If nearness to life is to thee of so little worth! Blissful are the people And a wonder greatly shows What enthusiasm What exaltation are capable of No one unchanged Each upraised No one unaffected Each taking part Human virtue Powerfully Reawakened Earnestness and joy moderation and immoderation Cheerfulness Happiness and longing Spring and rest Recollection Greed Renunciation Avarice Prodigality And covetousness Everything beautiful Good, ugly Bad testimony of its own life Perceptible, tangible Sense gives the soul sense first Soul is sense Gods You who gave the soul Senses to perceive the soul Gods Be praised! Thou golden god, thy glow streams through me like pleasure! Only what glows is good Unassailable virtue of gold Unlosable virginity Rewarded as a model and image O golden God O priests of the golden Gods The blood of virginal untouchability Like gold's metallic coldness Not warmed up for fructification O Gods, exalt your priests Exalt us To the first and last pleasure Heat up our blood That it may evaporate Sizzling on the cold gold! O red gold! Blood offering! After your model, gods Live we love! Holy is genital power! Holy is fecundity! Holy is pleasure! Gods, you who gave the soul Senses, to perceive the soul Gold glows like pleasure! Human virtue is like gold! Gold is like pleasure! Gold is mastery! Justice! Bewildering glow! Moses is going down from the mountain! Begone, thou image of the inability to grasp the boundless IN an image! All pleasure, all joy, all hope is gone! Let us flee the violent one! Aaron, what hast thou done? Nothing new! Only, what was constantly my function When thy idea gave forth no word My word no image Before their ears, their eyes to do a wonder On whose order? As always I heard the voice within me I did not speak But I nonetheless understood Be silent! Thy mouth Thou wast long far from us By my idea! That ought to be near thee! When thou makest thyself solitary Thou art thought dead The people have waited long upon the word of thy mouth From which rule and law spring So I had to give them an image to look upon Thy image faded before my word! To thy word images and wonders Which thou despisest Were otherwise denied And yet was the wonder no more than an image When thy word destroyed my image God's eternity annihilates The gods' presence! That is no image No wonder! That is the law! The imperishable Say it, like these tables Perishably In the language of thy mouth! Let Israel's persistence Attest The idea of the Eternal! Dost thou now intuit the almightiness of the idea Over words And images? I understand it so This people shall be preserved! But a people can only feel I love this people I live for them and want to preserve them For the sake of the idea! I love my idea And live for it! Thou too wouldst love this people Hadst thou seen how they live When they dare, see, feel, hope! No people can believe What they do not feel Thou shakest me not! They must grasp the idea! They live only for that! A pitiable people, a people of martyrs would they be then! No people grasp more than a part of the image Which expresses the graspable part of the idea So make thyself understandable to the people In a manner suited for them I should falsify the idea? Let me resolve it! Transcribing, without speaking forth, interdictions Fear-arousing, yet followable Assure persistence Necessity transfiguring Commandments Hard, yet hope-awakening Anchor the idea Unconsciously will be done as thou wilt Humanly stumbling Wilt thou then find thy people Yet worth loving! That will I not live through! Thou must live! Thou cannot do otherwise! Thou art bound to thy idea! Yes, to my idea As these tables express it That are also only an image a part of the idea Then I smash these tables And will pray God that he recalls me from this charge Fainthearted! Thou, who hast God's word With or without tables I, thy mouth Do guard thy idea however I may speak it forth Through images! Images of thy idea They are the idea, like everything that issues forth from it I bend myself to necessity For this people shall be preserved to attest to the idea of eternity My destiny Is to say It worse than I understand it Nevertheless those who know Will always find it again See there! The fiery pillar! It leads us by night The Almighty gives a sign to the people through me The cloudy pillar! It leads us by day idolatrous images! God's signs Like the glowing thornbush! Therein the Eternal shows not himself But the way to himself And the way to the promised land! Almighty, thou art stronger than Egypt's gods Unrepresentable God! Unspeakable, many-meaning idea! Dost thou permit this interpretation? Dare Aaron, my mouth, make this image? Thus have I made myself an image, false, as an image can only be! Thus am I beaten! Thus all was madness that I have thought, and cannot and dare not be said. O word, thou word, that I lack! Act ‚Ö¢ Aaron, now it is enough! Wilt thou murder me? It is not a matter of thy life. The promised land... An image. In images had I to speak, thou in concepts, to the heart, where thou speakest to the brain. Thou, from whom the word flees along with the image, thou thyself remainst, livest in the images which thou dost pretend to produce for the people. From the source, from the idea estranged, then neither the word nor the image are enough for thee... Visible wonders had I to do, where the word and the image of the mouth failed. Then for thee only the deed, the action were enough? Then thou madest the staff into a leader, my power into a liberator, and the Nile water accredited almightiness. Then thou didst desire physically, really, to tread with thy feet an unreal land, where milk and honey flows. Then thou didst strike the rock, instead of speaking to it. As was commanded thee, so that water flowed from it, From the naked rock the word had to strike refreshment. Never did thy word come unexplained to the people. For this I spoke to the rock with the staff In its language which the people also understand. Thou sayest it worse than thou undestandest it, for thou knowest that the rock is an image like the desert and the thornbush. Three, which do not give to the body what it needs, against the spirit, to the soul, what of its absence of desire is enough for eternal life. The rock also, like all images, obeys the word, whereupon it was become apparent. Thus, thou didst win the people not for the Eternal, but for thyself. For their freedom, that they become a people! To serve, to serve the idea of God, IS the freedom for which this people is chosen. Thou, however, didst submit them to strange gods. To the calf and to the fiery and cloudy pillars. For thou dost like the people because thou feelest like it and thinkest so. And the God whom thou showest is an image of impotence, IS dependent upon a law above himself, must fulfill what he is prayed, must do what he has promised, IS bound to his word. As men act, for good or evil, so must he. Punish their evil deeds, reward their good deeds. But man is independent and does what pleases him, of his free will. Here the images already rule over the idea, instead of expressing it. An Almighty... Whatever he may maintain, is committed to nothing, bound by nothing. The deed of the transgressor does not bind him, nor the prayer of the good, nor the offering of the penitent. Images lead and rule this people, that thou hast freed, and strange wishes are their gods and lead them back into the slavery of godlessness and enjoyment. Thou hast betrayed God for the gods, the idea to the images, this chosen people to the others, the extraordinary to the ordinary. Shall we kill him? Always, when you mix yourselves amongst the peoples and employ your gifts which you are chosen to possess in order to the fight for the idea of God, and you employ your gifts to false and worthless ends IN competition with strange peoples to participate in their base joys, always, when you leave the absence of desire of the desert and your gifts have led you to the highest height, always will you be hurled down again from the success of misuse back into the desert. Set him free, and if he is able, so may he live! But in the desert you are insuperable and will reach the goal, united with God.
