No more. Is that supposed to scare me? - Don't be a wise-ass! - Just take it easy. Commander Farrell's trying to lay it out for us. Why don't you guys knock it off. How did you actually meet the secretary of defense? I was introduced to him by Pritchard. I met him when I was in college. - Pritchard? - Yeah, Scott Pritchard! Jesus. General counsel for the secretary of defense. You got it? Look, you know this already. When's he gonna come out from behind here? Six Months Earlier - Yes, sir. - Got it. Good evening, sir. Get that limo out of here. - Hi. - Move that car. Thank you. Lucky it's not a bullshit detector or else none of us would get in. - How are you Scott? - Hi, Tom. How are you? - Fine. - You look great. Thank you for the invitation. I'm not used to being in places like this. I suspect you'd like to. I take it you'd like to join our staff. That was the purpose of the note, wasn't it? It was a Christmas card. And as I recall, the message was: "Merry Christmas." Yes, thank you very much. David, Scott is here. Come on. I want to introduce you to someone. - Hello. - Scott, how nice to see you. - Nice to see you. - Thank you. - Scott, how are you? - Hello. This is Commander Farrell, the officer I mentioned. He has experience on the joint staff and naval intelligence. Everyone I know is looking forward to serving under you for another term. You must have a limited acquaintanceship. - Tom and I were at college together. - Good. He has great warmth. - He's a genius. - Oh? The normal rules don't apply. You know, some people think you're really the brains. Do they? Is that supposed to flatter me? He's the most extraordinary... ...person I've ever met. I'd lay down my life for him. Is that a job requirement? It was fantastic having the president here this evening. You'II agree we can look forward to a fine four years. Let's continue to keep our inaugural hair down with more music. Let's do it right now. All right? Come on. Yeah. All right. Excuse me, do you have a light? If you want to look down my dress, you should grow a few inches. - Wanna dance? - The twist? No, thank you. Well, we don't have to twist. - No meant no. - "No" wasn't a figure of speech? No. - You're pretty impressed with me. - No. Yes, you are. Stoli, straight up. So I was impressed. - Yeah. Want a drink? - Same. Make it two. You one of them? - One of who? - These hypocrites, all fat and shiny... ...gearing up to ram it to us for four more years. - Are you one of them? - No. I'II bet you are. You're pretty cynical. Adequate to the occasion. We have a potential nausea situation building here. - Let's get out of here. - My date's not gonna like that much. But what the hell. His wife will be delighted. Is this something we should talk about? Nope. - Where would you like to go? - Show us the monuments. - What's your name? - Bill. How you doing, Bill? You wanna shut the slide? - Sure. - Sorry, Bill. My name's Tom. I'm Susan. We're here. - Is this your apartment? - No. I have a key to my apartment. - It better be good. - We need your bed. Nina, Tom. Tom, Nina. There's a limousine downstairs. There's booze in my pantry, the refrigerator's full of food. Why don't you go to your place? It's just one of those things. Be a friend. If anybody calls, tell them I died or that I'm asleep, all right? - He won't call. - I'II think of something. - Here are the keys. - I gotta change. Everything you need is in the back seat. - You didn't. - Hey, now, you better beat it... ...before I get arrested. - Bye, Nina. - Oh, nice meeting you, Tom. Nice to meet you, Nina. Move it. - Get it out of here. - Okay, asshole. Come on. Hey, break it up. I gotta make a living. Can we move it along? The white zone is for loading and unloading passengers only. No parking. Take care of yourself. Send postcards from exotic ports of call. That's what you call them, isn't it? Exotic ports of call? A port's a port. You're exotic. Bye. Morning, Tommy. It's early to be relieving me. Well, I felt our motion change. - Have we set a forward lookout in this? - Yeah. Standing orders. Inform the captain the foredeck's shipping water. Right. Do you wanna wake him up? The fleet radioed, we got a Russian sub out there. We're to stay with it. Great. Give us a chance to try out the depth charges. Yeah, that'II be the day. The last one. Forward watch is down! Forward watch is down! He's gonna be swept over, sir! - Get the spot on him. - Aye, sir. - Where is he? - There he is! Hold on! Has he got a safety line on? Tommy! Sound the rescue party now! Help! Send the special rescue detail. Forward lookout down. Tommy, wait for the rescue party! Send the special rescue detail. Forward lookout down. Shit. Help me! Tommy, you don't have a safety line on! - Keep the light on him. - I'm trying, sir! Tommy! Keep the light on him! - It's too windy, sir! - Hold on! Don't let him out of your sight. Jesus! Help me. Hurry! He's got him. He's got him! - We got him! - Great! You've seen the leak on the budget cuts? I've read the papers. You're late. - Bad traffic. - You should allow for that. I do. I've redlined the relevant sections and my synopsis is at the end. Order breakfast. Most important meal of the day. You should take better care of yourself. - Menu, sir. - Five years, 2 billion dollars. Gulf maritime can't even get the prototype to float. The phantom sub is a sinkhole. I'm not putting another dime into it. But what about the Armed Services Committee? Duvall? One thing I look forward to in this four years... ...is putting that fraud Duvall in his place. He's right back there. I know. Let's go. Oh, hi. Mr. Secretary Brice. Good morning. - Senator, how are you? - Mr. Secretary. We've been discussing that piece on the budget in the paper. - Did you read it? - Not yet. - Scott mentioned it. - Mr. Pritchard. Where in heaven's name do they get their information? And that idea about cutting back on the phantom sub? It's groundless. We were going over our options. Mr. Marshall says the Soviets... ...are doing things with submarines that will turn your hair white. You can rest assured I have no intention of making a decision... ...on this without consulting you first. Good day. Good day, senator. You believe that? No. The car, please. Marshall was telling us if we fight him, the CIA will be on his side. Of course. He pushed Marshall for the directorship. I'm sorry. Sometimes I'm short with you. - It's fine. - A few months ago you introduced... ...me to a friend of yours. An officer. - Commander Farrell? - Right. He has a background in intelligence? - Two tours with naval intelligence. - We could use a hero. Get him here. - His ship's in Manila. - Just do it, please. No, no, no. You want-- Come here. You want a real hero. - You know you want to! - Come on. - You're an officer. - You're making it hard on me. You're making it hard on me. They'II be there. - You know what I mean. - What's that? - You deserve the damn medal. - I carry? Jump me for promotion, I'II kill you, your family, your pig. - I carry. - What? You carry me? - No, I speak Filipino. Beat it, kid. - He's gotta make a living. Don't run. - He's gonna run. - If you run, I hurt you. He's running! Kid! John, forget it! No, let him go. Let him go. So what? He's got a toothbrush, a pair of skivvies. So what? Okay. So, what do we do now? I don't know. I thought I'd buy some ashtrays... ...and take in some of the local folk dancing. - Folk dancing? - Yeah, folk dancing. No, person-to-person. You know, when you only pay if you talk to the person? Shut up! Just shut up! No, not you. - Groovy! - No, I will pay. - First, I have to know if she's there. - One, two, three, yeah! If I'm going to count out a million pesos, I need to know if she's there. Yeah. That's my money. That's my money. Go get it. Go get it. No, no, I'm not joking. I'm an American. Hello? Yes. Connect. I'II take it. I'm putting my money in now. Susan? Hello, Susan? Was I just--? Was I just disconnected? Why? Why? I'm gonna show them how an American... ...plants the flag in a foreign fucking land! Yeah! Can I get a beer, please? I'd like another beer. Wild thing! You're beautiful. - Hey, thanks. - Keep it. Thank you. Hello, Tom! Welcome back. I have some mail for you. Come in. Come in. The Philippines a romantic place, huh? I painted a new painting. Christmas in New England. It's beautiful. You really like it? Well, it's unfinished. Will you be with us for a while? Yes, I'II be working in the Pentagon again. Thank you. Great. It's always a pleasure to have you back. Oh, my God! Hello. The Ancient Mariner. Not so ancient. I'm wasted! I can see. Wow, I'm so happy to see you! When did you get back? Why didn't you call? - I did call. - I wrote you. You did? I'm semiliterate, so it was wastebasket time. If you caught gonorrhea, I'II kill you. - I'm wearing too many clothes. - It doesn't feel like it. Talk about feeling like it's not wearing anything. - Oh. Oh, you're gonna blush. - You are a very bad girl. Hold it. I mean the blush. God, I'm so embarrassed. What are you doing? - I want a picture. - No pictures! Naval hero blushes. Come on. You're proud. No, I'm not proud. I'm serious. - Don't take a picture of me, please. - Come on. - Give me that. - You jiggled the camera. You pervert. I think I did this way too early. It looks like a baboon in a closet at midnight. Good morning. Go right in. - May I take your hat, sir? - Thank you. Commander. - Glad to have you with us. - It's nice to be here. Scott has a very high opinion of you. - Are you familiar with your new duties? - No, sir. - Then this meeting is premature. - Tom arrived in Washington yesterday. Well, since you're here.... You'II function as liaison, under Scott's supervision... ...between this office and the intelligence community. Calling those piranhas a "community" is ironic. You'II meet with a representative from all the agencies. For now, I am primarily concerned with the CIA. - Sir? - Are you aware of the phantom submarine? - Yes, sir. - Have a seat. Thank you. It is supposed to be invisible to sonar. The builder's first instinct-- I should say his second instinct. His first being to get his snout... ...deep into the public trough. They want to build a submarine roughly the size of an aircraft carrier. The Russians won't need sonar, they'II just see this bulge in the ocean. I want to terminate this program. There's gonna be congressional resistance... ...principally from Senator Duvall. Excuse me. Scott. What's worrying is his connection to the CIA. We expect them to feed him inflated estimates... ...of Soviet research in the field. To counter him, we need the same information. Not self-serving gloss, but the raw data they base their conclusions on. - Your job is to get it. - Yes, sir. But raw data from the CIA.... My experience-- They'II give it to us or they won't. If they do, I'm correct. If they do not, I will use that against them with the president. - I'm speaking in complete candor. - Yes, sir. Senator Duvall. Senator Duvall is motivated by this absurd lust-- Sit down. This absurd lust for power. This would be comic if it wasn't so damn dangerous. Marshall at the CIA is his.... Creature. You, as a career officer, are above this political unpleasantness. - Yes, sir. - Go with Scott and learn the background. - Yes, sir. - Let's cut the protocol. Without a demurral, I'II assume your responses are in the affirmative. Lorraine, get my wife on the phone, please. I think he likes you. Okay, this is the situation room. And right this way, sir, is the computer center. Did I mention, sir, I am very pleased to be working for you? This is a Sperry 90/80. The terminals in this room are for it. It interfaces with the IBM 370s at NSA headquarters. It works programs for Comsec, SIGINT... ...the personnel command, the Bureau of Alcohol and Fire-- I get your gist. That's Dr. Hesselman, the systems analyst. - I know who it is. Sam Hesselman. - It's good to see you. Why didn't you call me when you got in? - I don't know. Why didn't we call? - Sir? You look great, Tom. Come on in the office. - Mr. Fox, take a break. - Yes, sir. Are you back for good? I don't know about "for good," but I'm here. How are you? Can't complain. - Helen and the kids asked about you. - Good. The kids loved the ashtray. They didn't know a donkey could do that. Come on. Tom, this is Kevin O'Brien. CIA. I've explained you're taking over liaison. - Kevin will be your contact. - Good to meet you. If I can help you settle in, let me know. Right now I'm getting my feet wet, trying to catch up. I thought because you didn't want to wait until the meeting-- I'm certain there are questions Commander Farrell has. I'm not sufficiently prepared to ask anything. I wouldn't want to waste your time. Well, then if you'II excuse me. Maybe there is one thing. The secretary asked me to prepare him for the NATO meeting... ...and I'd like to be familiar with Russian intelligence estimates. We submit a report on the first of the month. It'd be a big help if you could send what you have as of now. I'II put something together. - Thanks. I'd appreciate it very much. - Don't mention it. That was deftly handled. For a moment there, I thought-- Just trying to be subtle. That's my job, isn't it? - Was this a present? - Yeah. - He gave it to me. - He did? He has expensive taste, this guy. Didn't cost anything. Some foreign minister gave it to him. So we're dealing here with a guy... ...foreign ministers give presents to? Don't start that stuff. I didn't say anything. You don't have to say anything. You never say a word. Well, I thought I wasn't supposed to. You know what I mean. You get that wounded, disapproving look on your face. Ask me a question, I'II answer it. It's David Brice, secretary of defense. Satisfied? You know I work for Brice? Then that makes two of us. - Did you take care of everything? - Yes. I'm supposed to pick Miss Atwell up at 8:00, if she remembers. - You don't approve of Susan, do you? - Sir? She's bright and exciting. Can't you understand? Not exactly, I guess. All right. I'm a pain in the ass. But this one can do things for me like no woman I've met. It's the only other thing worth living for. - What is the big deal about tonight? - He likes to see me in public. So, what does he get, a secret hard-on? Try and understand. - I'II call you later tonight. - I'II wait by the phone. - Hello, Scott. - Hello, Miss Atwell. - Two white wines, please. - Mr. Brice. Mr. Marshall and I have been having a little debate on government service. Now, I claim that the fellow with the appointed job... ...well, he sort of comes and he goes at the pleasure... ...of this or that administration. He blows in the wind. Whereas, the elected official, well, he serves the people directly. He has to be more responsible. What do you think, Mr. Secretary? Senator Duvall, I think it's getting very late. - Oh, yes. Thanks. - Thank you. Who's that man licking Duvall's ear? I recognize him. I would hope so. That's Marshall. He's the director of the CIA. You would hope so. No, thank you. Commander. - So nice you could make it. - Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen. It's very good of you to come and help us celebrate our national day. After all, we're a small country, far away. We've got entertainment for you this evening... ...which I'm sure you'II enjoy. I'II be right back. - Hi. - Hi. You're going away? - Just for the weekend. - Perhaps a romantic interlude, yes? Perhaps. If I intrude on your privacy, for this I am sorry. It's not just a job, it's an adventure. What are you eating? - You're eating bugs? - I gotta have another one. - Here you go. - That is really disgusting. I love Tom Farrell! Yes, I do! Yes, I do! Yes, I do! Hold on! Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Take care of us. I will. You guys newlyweds? - You can go. - Thank you. You're beautiful. - Mr. and Mrs. Smith? - A romantic gesture. How very original. I spelled it with a Y. - Hi. - Hey, there. We want to rent a boat. - Twenty bucks an hour. Take your pick. - We don't want a plastic toy. We want something like this. - No, no. - Why not? That's my boss's boat. It ain't for rent. Well, I want it. Don't do this. You're bad. Do you really know what you're doing? It's gusting like a son of a bitch out there. One more. God, I wish the Navy were still like this. Let's get ready, we'II come about. - Give me a kiss. - Okay, hold the fort. We're gonna come here. Let me get it off. - Ready? - No, not yet. - Okay, whenever you are. - I'm ready. - Say, "Helms alee." - Helms alee! Very tight. Hello? Oh, hi, Nina. Tom and I just got back this minute. Okay. Yeah. Can I call you later? Okay. Bye. Well, it didn't take him long, did it? That was Nina, so don't. Don't what? Oh, no. Tom, David's here. Oh, my God. I'm begging you. Go now, out the back door. I'm sorry. Just-- When I go, it'II be through the front door. As a favor to me, just this one time. Please! Please go! I promise I'II work everything out. All right? Tom, please! Why don't you fucking go down and beg him not to come in? You want me to say it? I'II say it. Tom. I'II leave him. I promise, I will. I'II leave him. I love you. You've been out of town. And you have a pleasant flush. - I got some sun. - Oh, how nice. - With whom did you get this sun? - What? What? I said, who were you with this weekend? Nobody. I find that hard to believe, that you'd go away completely alone. I didn't say I was alone. You said you weren't with anybody. I mean, nobody you know. I know a great many people. How do you know it's somebody I don't know? You want a drink? He's a man I know. It's of no importance. It may be of no importance to you whom you sleep with... ...but it's of importance to me! Why worry? There's plenty left. Get out of here, you bastard! Get out! I'm calling the police. Get out! I wanna know who it was. Listen, goddamn it! I pay the rent here. Get out of here! All right, wait. Wait a minute. I'm sorry I slapped you, all right? - No! Damn it! - Listen! - You tell me-- - No! - You tell me who it is! - He's not a pig like you! Susan! David, what's the matter? I think I killed Susan. - What happened? - I killed her. I needed somebody to talk to before I go to the police. Sit down. Sit down. It was an accident. I didn't mean to. She was with some man, and I just must've gone crazy. The man was there? He saw you? He saw me go in, yeah. Who is he? It was dark. Then maybe he didn't see you. I parked my car. I stood under the light. He saw me. He saw me. Hi. I can't come to the phone right now... ...but when you hear the beep, tell me everything. - Did she ever photograph you? - No. This is the negative side of a Polaroid. It was under the bed. Are you absolutely certain? I'm certain. I'm not that big a fool. Then we have to find the man who saw you. What if the search for this man was of vital national security? A secret operation that we could control. It won't hold up. We'II invent an excuse to justify it. The important thing is to abort an investigation of her death... ...before it gets to you. No. It's a house of cards. There is no Yuri. It doesn't matter. All the intelligence agencies... ...believe that there's a mole in the defense department. You know the theory. Yuri was sent here by the KGB while he was in his teens... ...and for all purposes, he can pass as an American. It's the CIA's wet dream. There's never been any evidence. But now there is. He was the man who spent the weekend with Susan. He was the man who killed her. Lorraine, will you ask CID to get all the material on Yuri... ...and bring it in to the secretary as soon as possible? Thank you. - I don't think we can bring this off. - You can. Excuse me. - Good morning, major. - Morning. Thank you. If military intelligence can catch this KGB agent without assistance... ...it will strengthen us against the CIA. Thank you. This has to move like lightning. We have to finish before anyone knows what we're doing. Control the investigation. Responsibility is consonant with you. I have implicit trust in you to keep this under wraps. You're to report to me or to Secretary Brice only. - I will be here around the clock. - What do the police know? They haven't been informed. CID has taken the body to Fort Meade. If we go looking for a spy without the FBI or the CIA, it'II raise hell. That's my problem. What do we have on the dead woman? It's through Yuri's association with this woman that we'II find him. Here's everything we know about her for the moment. He spent the weekend with her somewhere. Then he brought her home and killed her sometime around midnight. It shouldn't be hard to find out where they'd been. Tom? Yeah. Yes. The investigation will develop material-- Will you excuse me? - Commander Farrell, are we boring you? - No, sir. May I? We can't even convince our own people. It's all right. Get Donovan in here. Commander, if you please! Commander? This is Major Donovan of criminal investigation. His men will conduct the investigation on your orders. Major. We're down in the situation room, commander. We have to have a front man. - They're autopsying the body. - I wanna see her apartment. - That's not necessary. - I want to see it. - They're autopsying the body now. - Good. - I wanna see her apartment. - Mr. Pritchard-- It's more important that you remain here. I've got men checking for physical evidence. - The print people are back. - What did they find? Fragments of smudge. The place was clean. What's going on? A matter of the utmost importance. What is this? We're checking calls from the week, to see if her number comes up. - There's gotta be millions. - We interface with the phone company. We're monitoring every call made in a 50-mile radius. We're checking restaurant and hotel credit card receipts. - Who is this bimbo anyway? - She's dead. One billfold. - Bracelets. - This is from her house? Yes, sir. One box of candy mints. Got one brown hairbrush. Commander Farrell is on his way in. We'II have a report soon. - What's this? - Polaroid negatives. - I can't make anything out. - Excuse me. If there's silver on the emulsion, we may be able get the picture. Excuse me. Sergeant, get this right over to the photo lab, huh? - Sir. Commander. - Yes? Mr. O'Brien's in your office. We made an appointment to go over the CIA report. - Just cancel it. - If we do, he'II go away suspicious. That's true. Hello. I'II be in Commander Farrell's office... ...could you call me in five minutes? Sorry it took so long. - This is the official estimate. - It's an advance copy. I thought that was what you wanted. Pritchard here. Yes, of course. I'm sorry, I'm wanted in the secretary's office. I suggest that we reschedule this meeting. Perhaps Commander Farrell and I could continue. - Commander Farrell-- - Sure. We're both requested at the secretary's meeting. I'm afraid we must stop. Kevin, I was wondering if you might help me in the counterespionage area. Tom, we'd better get to that meeting. Commander, when you get more time, you give me a call. I can be reached 24 hours a day. Good. - What was that supposed to be? - I might get something about Yuri. What we have will be quite sufficient. Arrange that all outgoing calls are monitored. - All calls? - Brice's lines are safe. - I'II see to it. - Now. - What's that? - Autopsy report. She died of a broken neck. Here's a list of her stomach contents. What the hell for? There are chemical pollutants in food. There's a chance we might pin down where she ate her last day. Stay close to things. Do nothing until you're instructed by me. - Who are these goons? - They're associated with Special Forces. - What's that mean, "associated"? - That means exactly what I said. - They were formerly in Special Forces. - Honduras? El Salvador? - Somewhere down there. - Were you with the death squads? - It's possible. - They're assassins. You needn't concern yourself. They work for me now. Leave us, please! You haven't told me everything. The Atwell woman knew Brice. She was his mistress. Naturally, Brice had no idea of her connection with a Soviet agent. We found out last night, after the murder. Brice is in an impossible situation. We should call in the FBI. Don't be an idiot. Do you realize the magnitude of the scandal? The secretary of defense and a Soviet agent... ...sharing the favors of a murdered whore. David might be a suspect in the killing. I think that's something to consider. Tom, Brice was with me in my apartment at the time of the murder. - He couldn't have done it. - Let Brice take his chances. That decision is not yours to make. What we will do is catch this Yuri... ...before anyone knows what's happened. We'II handle it. - You mean the gentlemen in that room. - The man is a spy and a murderer. - Would anyone deny justice was done? - I would. We shall have that discussion, but for now... ...I expect you to follow orders and demonstrate the personal loyalty... ...to which we have every right. - You expect a lot. - I depend on you. We're friends. And, Tom, if it were your intention to do... ...anything to bring down David Brice... ...I'd have no choice but to make sure that you didn't get away with it. - Thank you for the warning. - I'm certain it's unnecessary. You'II see that we're following the only possible course. I gave them the estimates. They couldn't have cared less. Get me Senator Duvall. What's this top-secret business I've heard about at the Pentagon? Here's what we do have. CID is running a phone check. They're looking for calls placed to a Susan Atwell. Who is she? She's in the morgue at Fort Meade. She was murdered. - We know anything about it? - Get ready. We think she's either David Brice's or Scott Pritchard's mistress. She was seen with both of them. It didn't seem high-priority... ...so my people have been lax in following it up. Well, split milk, and you can forget about Pritchard. He's homosexual. I'II be damned. So will he, if you believe the Old Testament. Who killed her? We don't know. They got CID believing they're searching for Yuri. Don't tell me anybody swallowed that. That poor son of a bitch Brice. You know, I almost feel sorry for him. - Who's running this at the Pentagon? - The new boy, Farrell. So he can take the fall. This morning, he looked like a man who'd like to have a heart-to-heart. Yeah. Senator Duvall. Billy, I've been hearing some disturbing news... ...about the phantom sub. I tried to talk to the president about NATO. He wanted to talk about the phantom sub. Why the crunch has come now is beyond me. - We'II just have to handle it. - You got me handling a hell of a lot. Yeah? Hold. Commander, line two, the other phone. I'II call you back. Yeah? I'II be right down. - They want me in the computer center. - I'II go with you. Oh, yeah, by all means, go with him. - What is it? - Lab said there's no more image... ...they can get out of this Polaroid. Damn, too much to hope for. We'II have to forget it. Maybe not. There's something I want to show you. Now, this is as bad as your Polaroid, right? Now watch. This is a training tape. I'm speeding it up. The picture is broken down into pixels. That's the smallest element on the emulsion. An atom of the picture. This is the good part. The computer asks itself: What would be next to what? That's all there is to it? We have to keep on top of the computer. Computers don't think. If we had programmed this to come out a car... ...well, right now, you'd be looking at a hairy Buick. - Just get started on it. - Wait a minute. It takes billions of calculations. It may take 12 hours or a week. Well, that's too long. You can get what you need from the work in progress. We'II watch it on this. We've got a phone number listed to a Nina Beka. She called at about the time of the murder. - I better see her. - I was just about to send my men. Are you Miss Nina Beka? Yes. I'm Commander Farrell. This is Mr. Scott Pritchard... ...general counsel to the secretary of defense. May we come in? Please, do come in. I'm afraid that we have some bad news for you. A woman named Susan Atwell is dead. She was a friend of yours? Yes, she is. In what way were you acquainted? You see, I work at Shalini's Boutique in the pavilion. She used to come in there sometimes. Tell us as much about her as possible. We think she was killed by a man she'd been seeing. - Why? - You needn't concern yourself with why. We just need to know the names of the men she consorted with. - Consorted with? - Yes. I don't know about Susan's life. I'II ask you again, who were the men she saw? Ask 1000 times, and the answer will be the same: I don't know it. You're South African. - That's right. - I don't see a U.S. visa. You're an illegal alien. Do you know who I am? I can pick up that phone and have you on the first plane to Johannesburg. I'm assuming you have a reason for not wanting to be there. You guessed right. I know who you are. I know who Brice is. David Brice. - Is that the name you're looking for? - It's another man that we want. Well, in that case, why don't we make a deal? We'II talk about it. Who is the other man? Who is the other man? It's someone at the Pentagon. - Does he have a name? - I suppose so, but I don't know it. Listen... ...all I know is that Susan used to see him, and he reappeared. - How recently? - I don't know. - Three months? Two? - I don't know! Three weeks. Who cares? I don't know it. Listen, she never discussed these things with me. All right, we're going to close the part of the investigation that concerns you. - Tom. - Thank you, Miss Beka. You've been very helpful. Sam! I want the names of personnel assigned to the Pentagon in the past two months. I just have to set up a program to find it. Mr. Pritchard. Tom, I've got a suggestion. We're doing this credit card search... ...but it's extremely unlikely anything would be in so soon. We're wasting time that we could use better. - I know. I want you to keep on with it. - What's all this about? - We'II talk later. What is this? - I have to see Brice. Get started on that list of new employees. Yeah, we isolated three pollutants in the dead girl's stomach contents. The red, green and blue lines on the graph. If we can get the overlays to match, we might pinpoint where she was. So far, it looks like somewhere near upper Chesapeake Bay. Come in. Excuse me, have you seen Major Donovan? - No. - It's important that I get this to him. - What do you have here? - We missed it the first time around. It must have fallen under the seat of her car. I'II take care of this. Very well, sir. Was this a present? - Yeah, he gave it to me. - He has expensive taste. It didn't cost him anything. Some foreign minister gave it to him. I pride myself on being a man of forbearance and conciliation... ...but if you fuck me on this, I'II crucify you! I am not your rubber stamp. You have run roughshod over this office. It's over. You may disparage your predecessors all you like... ...but I don't recall any secret investigation... ...that required the Department of Defense... ...circumvented CIA and the FBI and the Washington police. We're not locked into any position on the phantom sub. What are you saying? I'm trying to allay... ...his fears that we act peremptorily. We will act the way I decide on this matter. Gentlemen, I don't see any point in squabbling like children. Mr. Pritchard, I'm encouraged by your attitude. I'm sure your investigation... ...whatever it is, is perfectly proper. I must apologize for my unseemly outburst. It's just that I've been sorely troubled. That's perfectly understandable, senator. - We can reach an accommodation. - Gentlemen, I'm deeply gratified. Deeply gratified, and I hope you'II forgive my imposition... ...on such a busy day. - He's got us. - This is insane. It's out of control. Your cover story's not gonna hold. Yes, it will, but you have to have more moral courage. Have you ever heard of a woman named Nina Beka? - No. - Well, she's heard of you. Instruct the CIA to get in touch with you. Remain there and wait for information. Do not call me. - I'II check in with you. - Yes. - As quickly as possible. - Okay. Hey! You two! Scott, where are they going? - Where are they going? - Who's that? - You know who I mean, the bookends. - I sent them on an errand. Tom. Tom. Tom! Yes, sir, I'II-- - I need a car. - CID's got everything. - This one. - You can't take that, lift's busted. - The man's gonna fix it. - Watch your toes. Come on! Get out of there! Get outta there right now! Shit. - Shit. - Hi. - Goddamn it, get him! - Come on, hurry up! Hey, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Hey, you okay? - I'm sorry. - Hey, slow down! Look out! Hey, you almost killed a guy here! I'm gonna get you, motherfucker! - Nina, come with me. - Tom. Is there a back way out? - What happened to Susan? - Listen, you're in danger, all right? - What's going on? - It doesn't-- - Can I go to my place? - No, they'II kill you. Oh, my God! You have to get lost, and I mean really lost. Thank you for before. - Go. - There he is! Look out, he's got a gun! I think we should go back to the Pentagon, sir. That was a stupid, stupid thing you did. - You're crazy. - I'm gonna save Brice, no matter what. - I told you. - I don't believe there is a Yuri. - He's real. - He has nothing to do with that girl. - We'II find out when we catch him. - Not if those two get to him first. Damn it! I am tired of weakness. I am faced with a grave problem, and I intend to resolve it quickly. You are crazy. You're fucking cuckoo. You're not to attempt to interfere with this investigation again. - Do I make myself clear? - I quit. Your resignation is not accepted. Be reasonable. I'm shielding you. Follow orders and everything will be all right. Let him go! Will you excuse me, please? I hope you're not calling your girlfriend. Big Brother's listening. - I don't give a shit. - Hello? - Fox! - Hello, sir. The writing on the box is Arabic, but it's in the Maghrebi dialect. What they speak in Morocco. What it says is kind of flowery, but it boils down to. "A gift to a true friend. " Good boy, you can come back now. Oh, jeez. The Polaroid just came online. Not much to look at, is it? No, it's not. Don't gifts from foreign governments have to be registered? - Yeah. - Are their files computerized? They'd be in the Department of State's computer. Can we access those files? They're closed. You'II have to get in touch with them tomorrow. I can't get in touch with them. - We can interface. - Can you do it now? There'II be hell to pay. Tom, does it matter to you that much? Okay. Thanks, I'II be back in five minutes. Come in. What is it now? I've been thinking. Maybe you're right. Yes. Let's just get this business over with, and I'm sorry I blew up at you. We're all very tired. Tom... ...when this is out of the way, we can do great things here. Well, first things first. How we doing, Sam? I'm into the State Department computer. - Can you print that out for me? - You got it. A lot of paper. You were right about the credit card receipts. We found one from a gas station in Annapolis. Great. - These the new people at the Pentagon? - Yeah, 4700 possibles so far. We've had a real break. The CID has pinned down your man's blood type. - How'd they get that? - Autopsy specimen. There was semen in the woman's body. Blood type is A-positive. That's pretty common, but it'II help narrow the list. You're a genius, Sam. I am. I am. I am. You should get some sleep. You must be exhausted. I know if I'm exhausted or not. As you say. You look like you just stepped out of a bandbox. - You're actually enjoying this. - I'm trying to do my job. It would be a lot easier if you'd stop attacking me. I'm sorry, I'm just tired. I've got a lot on my mind. If it doesn't move towards a coherent image, we just adjust the program. You mean, you could stop it and make it go in another direction? We've been doing that all along, but it looks like it's doing fine now. I'm not so sure. I think it's time we had a talk. I'm the one in the picture, Sam. You? Susan Atwell was the woman I've been seeing. I had nothing to do with her death. I was in love with her. Jesus, you must feel terrible. You're the only one I can tell that this spy-hunt thing's a phony. Yuri doesn't have anything to do with the murder? This, it's a cover-up. That's all I can tell you. - Come on. - Goddamn it, Sam, this is-- This is for your own protection, all right? These people have already tried to kill one person who knew. - What do you want me to do? - Slow the resolution on that. I need more time. I need more time to get this straightened out. That's what I need. I'm not satisfied with this. The Eigenvalue is off. Looks all right to me. We're pulling away from our information. Advise them to program a Fourier Transform. - That seems like a waste of time. - Just do what I want, okay? Easy, we're all working the same amount of time. I'm sorry, David. Just do it, please, okay? What are you looking for? Fuck off. Where are you going? I would rather do this myself. You can listen if you want to. - Display that badge. Hi. - Hi. - This goes here? - Yeah. - Where are we going? - Major Donovan's office. - Give a description of this guy to him. - Who's Donovan? Our commanding officer. Hello. You know who this is? I have to talk to you, but I can't leave here now. I'm on the damn pay phone now. It's probably not even safe. All right, I'II come there as soon as I can get away. I'II be damned! That's the son of a bitch who rented the boat! - Where? - He just went around the corner! - Do you see him? - He's gone. I'II get back to you. Yuri's in the building. - Buzz the secretary. - A witness spotted him. I know! Can I go in? - Go right in. - What are my orders, sir? Close all exits. Hold your witness while we decide what to do. Yes, sir. - Is Yuri in the building? - So it seems. - This is splendid work, Tom. - I've had all the exits closed. Why don't we empty the building and have everybody file past this man? The place will be swarming with cameramen. - We'II take the witness room by room. - It's the world's largest building. It's the only way we'II get any privacy. I'II see to it. Major Donovan, I suggest that all officers carry side arms. The man we're after killed one person already. Don't worry, Tom. I don't expect you to carry one. Tall or short? Thin or fat? Light or dark? - That's right. - You think this is some kind of joke? What I'm trying to tell you is the son of a bitch is average. All right, let's go find this "average" son of a bitch. I'm positive I remember this guy. I always remember the good tippers. CID has brought in another witness. A bellboy from a hotel in Annapolis. Now you can have two search parties. That's great news. We can move twice as fast. I'II see to it. You see, David? It's all coming together. Dear God, I hope you're right. All right, down this corridor. Make it quick. Let's go. That ain't him. I rented the guy a sailboat, give me a break. I'm sick of this shit. How much longer? To search this entire building would take all night. We have shifts finishing at 5 and 6. What do we do then? Let them out through the mall. - We'II have both witnesses there. - What do you think? Television. We haven't been allowed inside, but we're told there's hundreds... ...perhaps thousands, waiting to go home. Those allowed to leave say they were first cleared by the CID. The Criminal Investigative Division of Army intelligence. Apparently, there's a search for a person who may be a spy... ...trapped, right now, inside the Pentagon itself. We will follow events as they develop... ...and get back to you with updates. Melissa Donaldson, WCDM, at the Pentagon. - He must have gotten out past us. - No way. He's hiding in the building. We'II go back to the room-to-room. We'II search the situation room, computer complex. We'II start at the bottom and work our way up. Let's do it. Jesus. - You're to initial this. - What? - Initial this. - What is it? It's authorization to release the Atwell woman's body for burial. Down to 50 persons with A-positive blood. How many are men? Nobody told me to sort them by sex. Look, I gotta take a break, man. Sam, I need to talk to you. - I have to have your help. - I slowed it up. - They're gonna recognize this picture. - There's nothing I can do. - They mean to kill me. - You haven't slept for days. - I don't stand a chance in hell. - For God sakes, why? - Why would anybody want--? - Brice killed her. - Brice? - She was his mistress. - I thought she was your girl. - Look, here. See this? - See this? - "Antique gold box"-- This is a present to Brice from Morocco. He gave it to Susan. It's the only way I can prove he knew her. He'II call off the search, Sam, I know he will. - I see. - Do you believe me? Well, then can you insert that into the State Department's computer? - I can do that. - I know you can, Sam, but will you? - I'II do whatever I have to do to help. - Then let's do it. There's nothing there. If you want a piece of paper, type it yourself. The computer is searching to find a place to insert it. Then it'II print. - All right, how long? - Soon. First two on the right, second two on the left. Last man in the doorway. Nobody in or out. - What's going on? - We're gonna search. - Who told you to bring them here? - Nobody. This is the only major area that hasn't been covered yet. We'II be conducting a search in here, and I ask you all, please-- - Sir, wait. - Oh, Jesus. I have to change. - Okay, let's get going. - Don't let anyone pass. Sam Hesselman. Look, I'm sorry to bother you, but this is over my head. It's about Commander Farrell. I'm not sure-- I'm not sure he knows what he's doing. I'II meet you. Don't mention this to anybody else. I mean, the reason I called you was because I know you're his friend. You did the right thing. - This door's locked. - Anybody have an extra key out here? - This is Commander Farrell's office. - We better look. Well, tell you what, fellas. Here we go, maybe this will work. Nobody here. Let's get on up the hall here and see what else we can come up with. Hi. What's this all about, Dr. Hesselman? Promise me what I tell you won't go any further. - I feel disloyal enough as it is. - Of course. You understand that Tom is under great strain. Yes. He knew the girl who was murdered. They were very close. And he thinks that Secretary Brice killed her. Look, I know him. He's much more high-strung than he appears. And this girl... ...I guess he was in love with her. He thinks that somebody wants to kill him... ...and he asked me to reprogram the computers, and I did it. But now I don't know. I just don't know. I see. Where is Commander Farrell now? I suppose he's in his office or in the computer room. Thank you. Son of a bitch. Hey! - Come back here! - Hold it right there! - Hold it! - Sergeant, arrest that man. I'm giving you a direct order to arrest this man! - I have my orders from Mr. Pritchard! - Do it! - I have my orders-- - Shut up! Jesus. - If he resists, shoot him! - Yes. - Where are you going, commander? - You can't go in there. - You can't go in there. - By what right do--? - Call off the search. - Thank you. You're looking for somebody who knows Atwell was your mistress. - What are you talking about? - You gave her a gold box. - What? - You declared it to protocol! - I never declared anything. - Yeah? - You tell it to the State's computer. - What? Tell it to the computer at the State Department. Call off the search now! - Do it, or I'II nail you to the wall. - Calm down, I'II get Scott in here-- Come in, for God's sake. I had to make sure you were all right. Yuri must be close. There's been a murder. - He shot Dr. Hesselman. - Oh, goddamn it. What's happened, major? Yuri's somewhere between communications and the officers' gymnasium. That's very good, major. Just continue the search. You had those apes kill him, didn't you? No. You lying sack of shit. Tom is the man who saw you at Susan's. He's known about you all along. Isn't that right? You know what that means, David. If Commander Farrell was the man with Miss Atwell... ...then Farrell is the man who killed Miss Atwell. And we know that the man who killed Miss Atwell is Yuri. Therefore, Commander Farrell is Yuri, quod erat demonstrandum. You murdered Sam, didn't you? You're a fucking asshole. You have no idea what men of power can do! - You sick fuck. - Wait a second. Scott has been a loyal and valuable friend. I let that friendship cloud my judgment. My actions have been inexcusable. Scott! Scott! Give me the gun. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. But I swear, I'II do everything I can to help you out. I'II get you the best lawyers. David? He doesn't have a shred of proof. Wait. Wait. Wait. He was jealous of Susan. A man like that-- Do you understand? Suppose we had planned on working late Sunday night. He assumed I was with Susan. - David. - Don't touch me. He went there looking for me. They argued. You can assume the rest. - Just save your breath. - Help me out. Help me out. Help me out. Listen, I'II give you anything you want. I swear. I'II give you anything you want. Listen to me. Help me out. I will give you anything you want, just help me out. If you go against me on this, it'II be your word against mine, and I'II win. David! - Scott! - No! - What's going on in there? - Stand back, Mr. Secretary. Nelson. Your search is over, major. - Is this--? - He shot himself. Anderson. Commander, do I have your answer? Commander? Sir? Sir, are you all right, sir? - Give me your pen, ensign. - Sir? - You got a pen? - Yes. Well, give it to me. I want you to deliver this. I want you to wake him if you have to. Aye, aye, sir. Go. Charlie, come look at this. - Somebody get Donovan down here. - It's Commander Farrell. A lot of people are looking for you. Then aren't you the clever ones. - When is he coming out from there? - When you've made things clear to us. - Well, then, let's just get-- - We want to know what is-- You would've known before! I told you I could not get out of the Pentagon! Your relationship with the woman was poorly handled. You wanted me to be her lover, I was her lover. - I don't see any point with this! - Yeah, well, neither do I! We thought we'd never see you again. So did I. Couldn't you have managed this better? Not so fast... It's difficult for me to follow in Russian. It's been very long for me. How thirsty you must be for the sound of our language. Evgeni Alekseevich, wouldn't you love to hear Russian again? Imagine Pushkin, Lermontov, Tolstoy. Solzhenitsyn, Aksenov. Even then, always the sense of humor. In the Philippines when you passed the underwear bag, Moscow wasn't amused. I should have acted then. It's not possible for you to remain in the United States. This bizarre incident has given them their Yuri. Evgeni, think. - You're a hero of the Soviet Union. - I'm not a hero. - Be that as it may, you must return. - I came here. I thought I owed you that. But you can't make me go back. No! Let him go. He will return. Where else does he have to go?
