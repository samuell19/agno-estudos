[Seagulls crying] [bell tolling] [rat squeaks] [ship creaking] [dog barking in distance] He's inside. Get him! He's gone! Search the room. Hey, a party. Am I invited? John Smith, in the name of the king, you are under arrest for treason in Jamestown. Treason? You must be looking for Ratcliffe. [Both grunting] [man 1] He went through the window! [Man 2] Don't let him get away! [Man 3] After him! [Grunting] — [punching sounds] — [man shouting] Thanks for dropping in. Anyone else care to join him? [Soldiers grunting] [man 4] Cut him off! [Men grunt] [man 5] I've got him now! He's jumped! [Groans] The king believed my story. Pity- I so would have preferred to see you hanged. [Groaning] Ah! [Water splashing] [evil laugh] [fake sobbing] I did everything I could to save him. And that is the death of John Smith. I wanted him alive! As did I. But, Your Majesty, you don't need him to confirm what I've already told you. We must wait until John Rolfe returns with the chief of these Indians. The chief will only tell you more heathen lies. War is the only way. Very well, Ratcliffe. Prepare your armada, then. But we will await the return of John Rolfe and the Indian chief. [Hawk cries] [distant drumming] [laughter] [people chattering in Algonquin] — [Meeko chitters] — [Percy barks] [growling] [woman giggles] [grunts] [squeaking] [groans] [both grunting] — [squeaks] — [grunting continues] — [squeals] — Whoo! — [Laughs] — [screams] [Pocahontas] Whoo! — [Nakoma grunts] — [Pocahontas laughs] [sighs] Oh, much time has passed since the news of John Smith's death. Perhaps it's time to put this behind you. I know you are right. It's just hard to say goodbye. — [Eating sounds] — [Percy growling] [both whimper] [Percy barking] [whines] [Flit squeaking] [Meeko purring] J‘ The earth is cold J‘ The ﬁelds are bare J‘ The branches fold against the wind that's everywhere J‘ The birds move on so they survive J‘ When snow's so deep the bears all sleep J‘ To keep themselves alive J‘ They do what they must for now J‘ And trust in their plan J‘ lfl trust in mine J‘ Somehow I might ﬁnd J‘Wholam J‘ But where do I go from here?

Steady! Whoa! Whoa, boy! — [Grunts] — [villagers chattering] [Woman] Aah! [Groans] Bloody savage. [Shouting] [all shouting] [whooping] No, wait! — Wait! — Stand down! [Speaking Algonquin] It's all right now. I've taken care of it. The settlers need to know they can trust us to do the right thing. You should not have interfered. [Stammers] I beg your pardon? - All right. You have it. — I was trying to help. I did not ask for your help. Well, you didn't say thank you, either. What ever happened to manners and etiquette? Well, since you are new here, I don't expect you to have them yet. Women. [Flit squeaking] [woman] I fear the Indians may wage war. Oh, my dear, Pocahontas would never allow that. Pocahontas? Hm. John Rolfe, your horse, sir. Oh, there you are. Thank you. It's time I met this Chief Pocahontas. - [Rhythmic drumming] - [chanting, whooping] [chirring] [voracious eating sounds] [whooping] [all gasping] — [drumming stops] - [tribe whispering] Great Chief... ...I am John Rolfe. According to the customs... — How do you do? — [Powhatan] Let him pass. According to the customs of Greater Britain, I would like to present this horse as a gift of peace to the mighty Pocahontas. Daughter... — You? — ...this beast is for you. No, I'm sorry. It's my fault. — This horse, it's meant for... — Pocahontas, your king said. — Or did he speak falsely? — [Stammers] No! Never. It's just that... This is... No, this is... This is perfectly fine. Hm... Good job, Rolfe. I believe we can prosper together in this great land under King James' gracious rule. To build trust, I would like you to sail back with me... — ...to meet my king. — I do not want the pale chief's land. He wants mine. Why doesn't he cross the salt water to see me? I'm afraid that simply isn't done, Your Grand "ChiefIiness." Your kind are barbarians. They only want our land! — They mean to destroy our sacred... — Is that what they want? You don't know. Father, someone must go. You speak with the tongue of a pale one. — You belong with them. - [Gasps] Perhaps you should go. No! This is a matter of diplomacy. You can't handle a job like this. - I will go. — Daughter... Father, please. I can do this. You have your mother's spirit. — Very well. It is decided. - But... [Signs] Grand. [Nickering] Grandmother Willow, I need to speak with you. [Sputters] Is that my Pocahontas? - [Yipes] — [Willow] My, what is it, child? You are concerned about crossing the salt water. What if I can't bring peace? What if I'm destined to fail? What if I make things worse? - What if? — What if I can't make them listen? What if the sky turns to fire and your nose falls off? [Squeals] [Willow] Long ago, I told you to listen with your heart. It is time to listen to your heart. But the spirits around me... Can help, but only the spirit within can guide you. Listen to the spirit within. Listen to the spirit within. [F|it's wings flapping] [Flit squeaking] [Meeko eating loudly] [Percy growling] [whinnies] [all noises continue] [frustrated gasp] Grandmother Willow, it doesn't work. Grandmother Willow? [Man 1] Easy up, men! Here we go. Right-o. Over here. — [Man 2] Easy. — [Man 3] To the starboard. [Man 4] Hoist away! [Powhatan] I will honor my vow not to break the peace with the pale ones, but we must know their strength. Cut a notch in this staff for every pale face you see. Watch over my daughter. — [Man shouts indistinctly] — [muffled animal sounds] [whines] — [chittering] — [Pocahontas chuckles] I can't take you this time. Stay out of mischief and look after one another. [All sobbing] Do not forget this land. You will always be with me. Wait. What's this? This is Uttamatomakkin. [Grunts] Well, is Utta... Is he coming with us? Are you coming with us? I say, are you...? Hello? Can you hear me? Can he, can he hear me? Oh, yes, of course. This was a good idea, wasn't it? This will be fine. Fantastic. — [Man 1] All hands, up anchor! — [Bell clanging] [man 2] Anchor ahoy! — Undo the sails! — [Man 3] Aye, sir! Anah, Father. [Creaking] [Percy growling, hiccup] [squeaks] [Meeko chittering] All right, of course, yes. Swab the deck. Swab the deck. I mean, that's all we do around here, is swab the bloody deck. I mean, it is always clean anyway. I mean, what are we swabbing the deck for? — It looks clean to me down here. — [Sputtering] I don't see any dirt. ...swabbing the deck. I'm swabbing! Did anybody notice I'm swabbing? [Both shout] [man] Hey! What is that? What's going...? - Get him! That's it! — [Flit squeaking] [all grunting] [retching] Meeko, what are you doing here? [Hiccups, growls] What's all this then? Look, missy, I don't cotton to stowaways, and I'll not have you disrupting my crew. You can take this voyage below... ...or in the brig. — You're... — A guest of the king, and is to be treated as such. Am I clear, Captain? [Stammers] Why would you do that? Because, like it or not, you are the envoy and I am honor—bound to protect you. And honor, Pocahontas, is the backbone of our civilization. [Pocahontas] Thank you. - [Man 1] Land ho! — [Cannon blasting] [man 2] Pull the sails! - [Purring] - [growling] [man] Heave ho! Keep 'em taut. Here we go. [Both grunting] Welcome to London. [Percy growling, barking] [chitters] Shall we? Suit yourself.

[Man] Get out of the way! [Squeals] [Yipes] [whimpering, gulps] [gasps] You! Well done, Rolfe, bringing back a heathen as an example. Look at her. [Chuckles] She sticks out like a sore thumb. Pocahontas is here as an emissary of her people. A personal guest of the king. The king has appointed me to lead an armada against the savages. Don't tell me you didn't know? The king wants his gold. — There is no gold. — Another barbarian lie. As soon as the ships are armed, I set sail to destroy the heathens and reclaim Jamestown for James. - [Whip snaps] — [horse whinnies] We must stop him! Warn your king of his lies! But he wasn't lying. The parchment bore the king's seal. What? Then your king's promise to meet me was the lie. — The king doesn't lie! — They cannot both be true. No. Lt'sjust a misunderstanding. It has to be. I can straighten this out. Come on. Are you riding or running? - Mrs. Jenkins! — [Glass shatters] Oh! Oh! Ohh! Gods be gracious, is that my Johnny? — Ohh... — [Meeko thuds] Ohh, Johnny, you need a bath. - Oh! Oh, Johnny! — Look at you. [Mrs Jenkins laughs] Oh, you. Mrs. Jenkins, I would like to introduce Pocahontas. Pocahontas, Mrs. Jenkins. The Jenkins have been with the Rolfes for generations. — Careful. She's about to put on tea. — I'll put on some tea. Oh! Ooh... [John] Oh, and Uttamatomakkin. Ohh... I'll put on lots and lots of tea. — I'm off to see the king. — I want to go with you. Pocahontas, the conventions in England are very complex. — I must go alone. - But... I promise, I will arrange for you to see the king. — My word as a gentleman. Trust me. — [Door closes] [humming] [sniffing] !V! Mm! [Chitters softly] [Mrs. Jenkins humming] Hmm. Mm. [Chuckles] I must find a way to warn my people, to stop this. Leave it to Johnny. He gave you his word as a gentleman, my dear. You can stake your life on that. [John] I didn't exactly bring the Indian chief. No, no, no, no. I told you I would meet with the chief and no one less. Knight to bishop three. [John] Sire, I gave these people your word you would meet. Are we not honor—bound... [Ratcliffe] The king is bound to nothing, when you can not fulfill your mission. You were sent for the savage leader, and yet you bring back a woman. A woman! Your Highness, she is royalty, a princess. She is the daughter of a great chief who has travelled far from her homeland in the interests of peace. Meet with her, Your Majesty. May I suggest she attend the Hunt Ball? Let her go back to Virginia having witnessed the royal might and majesty of English society. Sire, she doesn't know our customs. To subject her to this kind of scrutiny would be... Well, I don't understand, Rolfe. If she's not a savage, then why shouldn't she fit in? Excellent idea, Ratcliffe. Rolfe, you will bring her to the Hunt Ball. Prove to me she is as civilized as you claim, and I will stop my armada. — If not, the armada sails. — But, sire... — It is decided! - Pawn to king! Check. '[John grunts] ‘ [gasps] - How did it go? - A disaster. She's invited to the Hunt Ball! Flabberdy—jacks. You were successful? When do I see the king? Our meeting with the king has been corrupted. — You're now invited to the Hunt Ball. — I don't understand. Oh, it's a trap! Ratcliffe manipulated the king! He's saying that if you're civilized you can fit right in. But it's the elite of British society, etiquette and manners. There's a million ways you can insult someone. Believe me, I know. And if you slip up just once, — Ratcliffe can convince the king... — Then I must not slip up. I can't learn your ways alone, but you can help me. What must I do? [Mrs. Jenkins humming] — [Pocahontas] John Rolfe! - [Gasps] [chuckles] How do I look? Hm? Oh! Lovely, in your... underwear. Didn't Mrs. Jenkins...? Mrs. Jenkins! [Glass shatters] Oh, my dear! Oh, come along, now. Let's go finish your dressing. [Both chuckle] J‘ Have no fear We're all right J‘ You've got me, dear to see you're a lady tonight J‘ What seems strange is just new J‘ People change every day till they ﬁnd their own way J‘ 80 can you J‘ And wait till he sees you after you're dressed J‘ I think the king will be very impressed J‘ Wait till he sees you walking with ease J‘ He'll be so pleased you came down from the trees J‘ You'll be ﬁne I can tell J‘ It's a very good sign that you're doing so well J‘ One more tuck One more bow J‘ Don't get stuck on that clasp J‘ Johnny's lucky they asked you to go J‘ 'Cause wait till he sees you He'll be so proud J‘ Maybe he'll smile if he thinks he's allowed J‘ Wait till he sees you there in your curls J‘ John's always had such a fondness for girls J‘ With curls J‘ And wait J‘ Wait till you're out on the floor J‘ Show them what dancing is for J‘ Music is all you need See where a dance can lead J‘ You two might come to see J‘ You were meant to be so much more J‘ Wait till he sees you Wait till tonight J‘ Fate has a way of arranging what's right J‘ After he sees you in your new clothes J‘ A lady of grace from your head to your toes J‘ Pretty and pink as the roses he grows J‘ Who knows Who knows J‘ I can't wait! Oh, I've got something for you. [Squeaks] Flit, stop it! It doesn't belong here any more. — [Sad squeak] — It's beautiful! [Bear growls] — [horse nickers] — [bell tolls] I have personally taken charge of the entertainment for the Hunt Ball. I want to make sure nothing goes... right. Well, how do I look? Pretty good, eh? Say, I thought you were getting dressed. You're right. You look great. Just don't talk so much tonight and we'll be fine. It's called powder. You look beautiful. [Animals making noises] I'll put on some tea. [Squeaking] [low growling] Oh... [horse whinnies] [bell tolling] [man] The Duke of Edinburgh. Lady Gray- Sir Thomas Ellory. [Faint music playing] Lord Raymond and Lady Theresa. — [Voices chattering] - The Earl of Essex. The Duke of Buckingham and Lady Buckingham. John Rolfe and Princess Pocahontas. 'Oh, my! '[All gasp] And Utam... Uttata... Ultimatum... Old tomato... - Try "Uti." — Oh, thank you, sir. And Uti. Jacket required, sir. - [Clothing ripping] — [man squeals] Oh, dear. [Chattering resumes] — [man] Oh, goodness. - [Woman] Oh, my. [Whispering to self] Hello, Your Excellent—ness. Your Great, Good... Good Highness. Greetings, Your Magnificence—cy. Hmm. Welcome to England, Pocahontas. Thank you, Your Grace. What do you think of my kingdom? I think you must be a great king to have so many subjects, Your Majesty, and the loyalty of so many good men. Did you hear that? She thinks I am a great king! Oh, what a delightful child! Charming! Absolutely charming! Your Excellency, please stop this armada. Oh, yes, yes. But right now I can't be rude and ignore my guests, can I? No! So we shall discuss it later. For now, my dear, enjoy the ball. Go on! Enjoy! [Music resumes] — [sighs] Thank goodness. - Ro|fie! Rolfie, old boy! Listen, we're having some friends out to the estate. Do come. Oh, yes, bring your delightful... [stammers] ...guest. — [Glass shatters] — Oh, Miss... Hontas. How drippingly marvelous to see you! - [Woman 1] Oh, my! - [Woman 2] Enchanting. [Woman 3] Fabulousjewelry. [Woman 4] Hello! May the dance begin! [Band begins playing] May |? [Chattering continues] [woman giggling] In one night you will have done more for the cause of peace than 100 diplomats. [Woman laughing] My, you look lovely. I can't even see the real you under there. I do hope no one else does. I was going to say the same about you. It's a very good thing Smith is dead. Seeing how disloyal your heart is would certainly kill him. — [Sighs] — [man rings bell] Dinner is served! Oh, no, madam. The guest of honor is always on the king's right hand. Your Grace, perhaps now — we might discuss... — [fanfare plays] Your Royal Highnesses, Lords and Ladies of the Court, and our distinguished guest from the forests of the New World. J‘ Things are not what they appear J‘ As tonight will make quite clear J‘ But what is real will be revealed I can feel the moment's near J‘ Things are never what they seem J‘ That will be this evening's theme J‘ Amusing sights for your delight Perhaps a few to make you scream J‘ You'll be surprised to see whose disguise J‘ is the cleverest one of the lot J‘ After our show the whole world will know J‘ Who's pretending to be what they're not J‘ If a jester's grin or a dancer's spin should be pleasing - J‘ Please say "yea" — Yea! J‘ If a juggler's feat should be incomplete - J‘ He's the one to greet with "nay" - Nay! J‘ If the fools we see look like you and me J‘ Then before the night goes by J‘ Ask why, why, why, W/W J‘ Why VVhy? J‘ Things are not what they appear J‘ And the ﬁnest proof's right here J‘ How I regret when ﬁrst we met I believed my own worst fear J‘ Things are never what they seem J‘ 80 in keeping with our theme J‘ A change of hair A dress to wear J‘ And our nightmare's now a dream J‘ Shoeless and wild I saw this sweet child J‘ As a danger to one and to all J‘ "Savage," I thought "What could Rolfe have brought?" J‘ Now I see she's the belle of the ball J‘ Things are never what they seem - He's right! He's right! - J‘ Many don't say what they mean - He's right! He's right! - J‘ A powdered face is just the place J‘ To conceal an ugly scheme J‘ Only one thing's really clear J‘ Things are not what they appear J‘ [all gasp] [bear roars] [silly giggling] - [gasps] — Sire, please stop this! She doesn't understand! Oh, nonsense! Everybody loves a good bear—baiting. No! Stop this! This is torture! This is an animal, nothing more. A helpless animal. Sit down at once, and we will overlook this savage behavior. Your behavior is savage. You and your people are the barbarians! — What? - Sire. Don't let the savage get away with this. Seize her! Savages! [Woman screams] [man] Keep her away! Get her! Take them to the tower! No! Your Majesty, please! It was a misunderstanding! Push me no farther or face treason. Where exactly do your loyalties lie? Let go! Let go of me! John Rolfe! John Rolfe! [Chattering] — You're cheating! - No, I'm not. I'll play that card there. The least you could do is put a head on it. How much do I have to pay to get...? You say it's not true? But I just heard meself from a guard what was there. The king's gonna have her head. Bloody savage. I bet you old John Rolfe wishes he never laid eyes on the likes of Pocahontas. I [door Opens] ‘ Oh! - [Whinnying] — [man] What's got into him? [WhippoorlNi|| calls] — [dog barks in distance] — [sighs] [animals all sigh] I think I'll put on some tea. What am I to do? Who are you? What do you want? [Thunder rumbles] Halt! Who goes there? John Rolfe. I have a prisoner. [All chuckle] Open the gate. Hm... Oh! [Grunts] He's escaping! Catch him! Now find her, Flit. [Muffled bark] [men shouting in distance] [squeaks] — Flit! — [Door opens] John! I knew you'd come! There's no time. We must go. [Gasps] John Smith? I thought you were dead. — Greatly exaggerated. — [Man shouts] I'll look this way! Let's go! There! [Chitters] Enjoy the accommodations. I'll take care of it. Pardon me. [Soldiers shouting] Oh, very stylish. [Both grunting] - Riding or running? - [Man 1] After them. They're getting away! [Man 2] Close the gate! [Muffled barking] [grunting] Blast it! They got away! [Bouncing bark] [Pocahontas] What happened to you? [Smith] Ratcliffe convinced the king I was the traitor. I had to stay hidden, let them continue to believe that I was dead. I missed you so much. I've thought of you every day. All this time. Why didn't you ever write to me? I wanted to. I must have started a thousand letters. Pocahontas, all that matters is that we're together again. [Clattering] What about my people? Once the armada sails, they won't stand a chance. How will her getting killed save them? Well, are you suggesting she turn her back on them? [Smith] Are you suggesting she die for them? [John] She can't just sit back and watch. — [Smith] She has no choice! — Of course she has a choice! Pocahontas! — Let her go. — You may not care about her safety... Don't you dare tell me I don't care about her! You love her. [Nakoma] Do not forget this land. J‘ In some new place on some new face I've never seen J‘ lmight ﬁnd where lbelong someday J‘ And there may even be another dream for me J‘ Waiting there somewhere along the way Listen to the spirit within. J‘ Who knows where lgo from here? J‘ 80 many voices Only one thing's clear J‘ There's nothing to lose J‘ Nothing to fear J‘ The past is gone J‘ lmust move on J‘ From here J‘ - I'm going back. - They'll hang you. Then I will be but the first to fall. They're not going to listen to you. Look at you. How can they respect my culture if they haven't seen it? This is insane! Nuts! Tell her she's crazy. You're crazy. I thought you may need whatever power this holds for you. I think it's time you taught society a lesson. I have decided. [Man] Hear ye! Hear ye! The High Court of King James will herewith commence. Presenting the first order of business... [all gasping] Pocahontas! Guards! Guards! [Crowd gasping] Surely His Majesty would not refuse an audience with a visiting princess. [Queen] James. [Grumbles] Your Grace, if you insist on war, my people will fight to the last warrior. There is nothing to be gained, but much to be lost, for all of us. There is no gold, is there? — No. Ratcliffe assured me... — [Smith] That I was dead? — [Crowd gasps] — Was it true? Ratcliffe has lied to you about everything. There are many voices around you, but you must listen to your own voice. Why do you speak out when so many doubt you, even when it could mean your life? Because I speak the truth. SHence! Ratcliffe has left. We must stop him! — But it's too late. — We must try. [Ratcliffe] You are the best soldiers in the civilized world. We sail to scour the world of the savage vermin. - Are you with me? — [All shout in agreement] — [thunder rumbles] — Riders approaching! [Grunts] Smith! [Gasps] Raise anchor! Cast off! — [Man 1] Lift anchor! - [Man 2] Drop the main sail! [Both groaning] — It's John Smith! — I thought he was dead! I'm the ghost of John Smith. Run for your lives! [Grunts] Whew! [Both grunting] Who started the party without me? — You call this a party? — You're not having any fun? [Screams] [all shouting] — [screams] — [squeaking] [grunts, gasps] Drop the anchor! [Shouts] — [man 1] Hard to port! — [Man 2] Bring her about! Bring her about! [Man 3] Prepare to crash! [Men screaming] [screaming continues] Now I can finally get rid of you, you savage! Mind if I Cut in? [Grunting] Trying to make a point? [Grunting continues] Please, don't hurt me, Smith. I was just doing my duty. Sheath your sword. Surely you know that a good soldier always follows orders. If it were I, I would have killed you years ago. As I was saying, I never liked you, Smith. I hereby sentence you to death. Goodbye, Smith. [Grunting] — Very stylish. — I learned it from the best. Pity. I so would have preferred to see you hang. [Screams] [sputtering] [happy chittering] [groaning, sputtering] [panting] Huh? Your Majesty, the fugitives are getting away! They've sabotaged the armada. Stop them! No more lies. Arrest him. [Distant cheering] - John Smith, what a heroic return. — Why, thank you, my lady. — How did you escape? — We thought you were dead. [Man] Bravo, John! [Voices chattering] Lord Advisor to the Royal Court. What a wonderful honor. [Squeaking] It's what you've always wanted. [Groaning] And you, you've done everything you've set out to do... ...and more. Your people will be very proud. Yes. It will be good to see them again. Well, perhaps one day you'll return to London. — Pocahontas... — John... The king has given me a ship! This is my dream! Ours. Every day a new adventure. New lands to discover. I'll chart a new course. And you'll be at my side, naturally. A ship of our own! I'll put a crew together immediately! We'll set sail right away! What? That's not what you want, is it? We walked the same path once. I have found where I belong. I hope you will also find happiness. May the Great Spirit always be with you. [Chattering] [chittering] Pocahontas? Pocahontas!
