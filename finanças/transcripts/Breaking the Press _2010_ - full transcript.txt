[soft music] -[bright orchestral music] -[birds chirping] [vehicle approaching] [birds chirping] -Hello there. -Hey. One of these days, I'm gonna pave that drive. [chuckles] Are you Mr. Summer? Yes, ma'am. TheTex Summer? Well, just plain Tex is fine. -Okay. -Come on in. Thanks. Oh, I'm Karen Thomas, pleasure to meet you, sir. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. How y'all doin'? Oh, great. Our magazine was thrilled to get this interview with you today, sir. You mean, you're not the census taker? [stumbles] Um, we-- [laughs] I'm just foolin' you. -[laughs] -I knew you was comin'. Can I get you something to drink? Oh, no, thanks. I drank a lot on the way here. Uh, water. A big water drinker. [laughs] What'd you say the name of your magazine is again? National Sports Program. Well, I should tell you, I have never been one for fancy interviews. Well, [laughs] this is about as fancy as it gets. Well, good. So, if you're ready. I'm ready as a bear trap. [soft music] Okay, let's get started. I am here with legendary icon and basketball coach, Houston's own, Tex Summer. So, Tex, tell us about the contribution you made to the Woodrow Wilson High School Wildcats. -[engaging music] -[crowd cheering] Well, ma'am, I got to say in all honesty, that wasn't all my doing. Tell us about that famous defensive strategy of yours. -Defense? -Uh-huh. Oh, no, ma'am, that's offense. Oh. Oh, I, I'm sorry, that's my mistake. Well, that's all right. Even my players didn't get it until much later. I'm guessing I might be your first sports interview? Second. I did a piece on bowling once. [chuckles] Truth is, I get real tired of doing the weather. [chuckles] Well, I can't blame you. That weather is predictable. [chuckles] But not so with the game of basketball. -[engaging music] -[crowd cheering] [whistle blaring] So, this strategy you gave to Coach Joe Conaghey. Well, I lent it to him. But no plan will work unless you got a coach who has sense enough to use it. Well, obviously he did. Well, yes ma'am, he did. But to understand it all, I guess we ought to start at the beginning. [soft music] Joe moved here to Texas from New Orleans with his new wife, Laura. They had an old car and scraped together enough money for a down payment on an old house. But with love and care, it became their home. Joe got a job at the middleschool, teaching social studies. But his true love was coaching those seventh grade boys on the basketball court. [Joe] Work around. [whistle blaring] [Joe] Line up. Sam Stevens? -Sir? -Give me the gum. Yes, sir. Let's run it again. [whistle blaring] Natural fuel resources. Now, what are four sources of natural energy? -Yes. -Oil. Good one. -Natural gas. -Natural gas, another one? -Uranium. -Uranium's a great one. -Coal. -Yep. They fit right into the community like an old pair of deer skin boots. [kids chattering] Joe gave the kids a new interest in social studies. [kids singing Jesus Loves Me] Laura worked part time and became active in their church community and she loved working with kids in Sunday school. ♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪ ♪ Yes, Jesus loves me [Tex] Well, they wanted to have children of their own, but Laura had suffered a couple of miscarriages and couldn't sustain a pregnancy. [clapping] So after five years of trying, the Conagheys had almost given up. Honey? How much we paying for this cable? I don't know. It's part of that package deal. [Man on TV] How fast can that thing go? [Man 2 on TV] Line 'em up! [people chattering] [Man on TV] Better question, how fast can we go? And now we go to the Saturdays for Children segment with Patricia Bloom. Patricia is with the Child Unit of the Texas State Department of Social Services and has supervised the continued care and placement of two wonderful little boys. This is Joshua. He is two years old and he likes to sing. Now, this little man over here, his name is Matthew, and he just turned three. Matthew is so strong. These two babes were abandoned, in a box, near a dumpster. A woman shopping nearby heard their cries and thankfully reported it to the police who rescued them. They are adorable. Patricia, how old were the boys when they were found? -[child crying] -Well, Joshua was just an infant. And Matthew was only one year old. Here, sweetie. You know, it's very difficult to separate siblings and it's even more difficult to place them in the same home together. But we are not giving up. Please contact the Child Unit by calling 1-800-JJ-KIDS-4, for these darling children. Once again, that number is 1-800-JJ-KIDS-4. Next is sports with T.K. Terrier. That's the second time we saw that story. I know. It's so sad. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Depends on what you're thinking. Let's take in those two boys. [soft music] Oh. Joe. We've been trying for five years. And who's to say these aren't the children that God had in mind? Let's just see what happens. I mean, we know nothing about these kids. What about their medical history and their family background? They look so different. I mean, they look like they could come from two different fathers. What is the town gonna say? What if we're not as strong as we think we are? [chuckles] Well, you're not. That's why we need faith. [soft music] [Tex] Adopting those boys was a mite out of the norm for that little town. But Joe and Laura were determined to carry it out. And in spite of the occasional jawboning from some of their friends and neighbors, a week later, they broughtthose two boys into their home. -We're home! -[people chattering] [Joe laughing] [Boy] Mamma. Welcome, this is your new home. -Mamma. -This is your new home. -[kids fussing] -Yes. Oh, hold it, hold it. This here's the good shot. Oh, Lordy, just the cutest things I ever did see. Bless your hearts. Now, say cheese. [All] Cheese! [camera clicking] Okay, we gotta go. Now, around here, the phrase "bless your heart" is what people say when they wanna criticize something and get away with it. [chuckles] She looks like she's put on 40 pounds since the last time I saw her. -[chuckles] -Bless her heart. [Tex] And don't get 'em started on a prayer chain. No, that is open season for gossip. Bless their hearts. Thank the good Lord... Joe and Laura were determined to see it through, 'cause those two boys certainly needed a loving home to grow up in. [chuckles] Yeah. Okay, a little high, a little softer. [Laura] Come on, Matthew. [air whooshing] -[people chattering] -Yeah. [Tex] Now, Josh was just a junior, a year younger than Matt, but he was a natural. Matt, on the other hand, had to work real hard for it. And he still never could do enough to match the magic of his brother. Joe got promoted from middle school to varsity coach. And he taught those boys the gospel of the fine art of basketball. -[people chattering] -[shoes squeaking] [Joe] Ok, set up! [Joe] Come on, Jordan, you're better than that. Let's make gold. Let's go, guys. Come on, Thomas. Hondo, stay on 'em. Stay up. [whistle blaring] Whoo! What was that? Everybody, bring it in. Right now. What was that? What'd I tell you guys about hot-dogging? Huh? I want us working on the fundamentals. It's not some kind of half-time show. Do you understand me? Yes, sir. That goes for each and every one of you. You keep that stuff for the playground. I want us focused on fundamentals and playing the game. Thomas, you understand me? Yes, sir. -X? -Yes, sir. Does everybody understand me? [Players] Yes, sir! Good. Line up on the line. Five suicides. What's up with your dad man? You got skills. Well, according to my coach, not my dad. Yeah, but he don't let you do what you do best. X, Alex. Do you wanna get it together? Or do you want us all to do 10 more? We live and die as a team, gentlemen. One screws up, we all suffer for it. Do we understand each other? [Players] Yes, sir. All on my whistle. -[whistle blaring] -[shoes squeaking] Let's go! We still have practice. Hey, Joe. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, I'll be right back. How're you doing? Doing pretty good. Listen, I know it's been a bit of a rough road for you, hasn't it? Uh, you could say that, yeah. I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm getting a lot of heat from folks inpatient with four losing seasons. [Joe] What are you saying? Well, I'm saying that your boy Josh is a real natural talent. Could lead us to the playoffs, don't you think? Yeah, I think he could, if he starts listening to me, he starts playing with his teammates. That's what I'm saying. Maybe if you lighten up on a little bit, he'll blossom. I'm sorry, he'll what? I'm saying let him reach his full potential. You got a good bunch here. I don't wanna stifle their talents. Why don't you let your players play a little bit more their game? That's all I'm saying. -Their game? -Yeah. Listen Os, I know where this is going. So, please don't tell me how to coach basketball. Look, I'm not trying to upset you. I'm trying to give you words of encouragement. You got a bunch of winners here. I mean, we can all see that. Your boy Josh could be a star. I'm just trying to give you a suggestion for your own good. You follow? Thank you. Hey, nice shootin', man. Yeah, sweet alley-oop, bro'. Hey, I'm like the postman. I deliver, you throw it down. [chuckles] Yeah. Man, we gotta get you comin' off some more screens. You need more shots. Man, he ain't lyin'. [slamming locker] What's up with him? Whatever. Let's get out of here. What's wrong? Let me guess, Josh? He could be so good, if he wasn't such an idiot. Matthew Conaghey, he's your brother. I'm sorry, he just drives me crazy sometimes. Talk to him. I've told you a million times. Now, I for one know that there'sa bunch of us around here that don't like to way our basketball program's going. We put a lot of resources into supporting our team and quite frankly, we are not satisfied with the results, Coach Conaghey. -[people chattering] -That's the problem. The resources are going to the wrong places. Well, I would like to hear what the coach has to say. Joe? You wanna say a word? I agree with everything Mr. Hunt's saying. I mean, I want results, too. But I can't focus on those results, if I gotta fight the competitionon the basketball floor and fight everybody in this room at the same time. We do the best we can, with the hand that we are dealt. So, Mr. Hunt, if you or anybody else in this room would like to come by practice tomorrow and show me just how you plan on getting those fast results, please. [Joe] I am all ears. If not, I'd like to go home to supper. Go on home. Thank you. [dramatic music] Thank you for your time. Hey, honey. How'd it go? Like I expected. Everybody thinks we should be preparing for the state championship. Now, don't let 'em get to you. [chuckles] How could I not? It's not like I had a winning season in a long time, much less made the playoffs. Well, what do they expect? It's high school. They expect winners. You will always be a winner in my book. Wish everybody felt that way. Where are the boys? They're outside, shooting hoops. Why don't you go get 'em, and tell 'em dinner's ready? [dramatic music] Hey, head's up. What's up with you? Don't walk away from me, Matt. You're such a jerk. I'm the jerk? I'm a jerk. You are so into yourself, you don't even know. Wow, dude, really? What did I do to you? It's not just me, Josh. It's everybody, okay? You're a good basketball player, but you suck as a teammate and you suck as a brother. I said, don't walk away from me! [boys grunting] [Joe] Boys. Boys! Quit it! Break it up! What's going on? What's going on? -Nothin'. -He's a ball hog. If this is about basketball, I'm the coach, not you, Matthew. Yeah, well, you're taking his side again. I'm not taking his side. Everybody on this team has a role. You're the backbone of the team. Some players need to understand that they get their team involved when they help each other out, pass the ball. Now what else is going on? I don't know, we're just sick of hearing stuff. What kind of stuff? A couple other players said some things and-- They found out we're adopted and that you're not our real dad. [soft music] That's nothing new. Most everybody around here knows that. You guys should be used to that comment. But they call us bastards. So, don't listen to 'em. Don't let it get to you. If they know it's getting to you, they're gonna continue to do it and it's gonna ruin your focus. Yeah, but it does get to me. [Josh] Me too. Well, Matt did set of hard pick on one, rang his bell. And I schooled the other, dunked on him. Guys. Don't worry about what anybody says about me or you or where you came from. The only thing that matters is where you're going. We got our first pre-season game tomorrow. Let's go inside, let's eat and you guys get to bed early. All right. I love you guys, go. Get cleaned up. [Tex] Now that kind of pep talk works at home. But it didn't stop opposing teams from riding those boys. -[whistle blaring] -[Commentator] Trent Johnson, here with my always animated partner, Hi-Top Smith. [Hi-Top] Howdy, folks. [Trent] Hi-Top, with just three minutes left in the pre-season opener, the Wildcats need a stop. Their lead is down to three points. Senior Matt Conaghey has got to stop Harris superstar Billy Johnson. Wildcats lead is just one point. Yeah, boy, who's your daddy? Who's your daddy? Is it the coach? I bet you don't even know who your real daddy is, do you? What, you got a problem with me, huh? [Trent] I don't believe what I'm seeing. Matt had just took the inbounds,turned and shoved Johnson. [Hi-Top] Both benches are clearing. [Trent] Oh, the referees are trying to restore it, but this is awful. [whistle blaring] Coach Joe Conaghey is beside himself. This is a nightmare for his Woodrow Wilson Wildcats. [Joe] You don't come off the bench! Sit down! Double technical. Number two is gone. [Hi-Top] Time for dinner. -This one's over. -[crowd booing] [Referee] Two and number twelve. Now, down south, you don't poke a stick at somebody's daddy or their mama, unless you want a whoopin'. [players chattering] Sit down, calm down. Sit down! [yelling] Sit down! Matt, what'd I tell you, huh? What did I tell each and every one of you? You stay on the bench. You don't lose your cool and[yelling] you stay on the bench! Because of it, we gotta forfeit. And that's a loss. -[kicks locker] -Damn it! Did he just say that? [insects chirping] [Joe] I thought we resolved this. Well, I couldn't help it, I lost my temper. And you're gonna hear it again. I guarantee it. Matt, you can't go around hitting people just 'cause you don't like what they say. People say things. It doesn't make it true. Good night, Dad. [door slams] Stubborn one? Bull-headed is more like it. I cussed in front of the whole team today. I try to do the right thing. I know what I'm supposed to be doing, but half the time I do the opposite. Don't beat yourself up about it, Joe. Your heat's in the right place and that's what matters most. Do you know, when we first met, the thing that attracted me to you the most? What? Your ability to admit when you were wrong. -[Joe chuckles] -It is. It's how I knew I could trust you. You and the boys, you're growing and learning together. Things always take more time than we want them to. I know. I think something great is just around the corner. Mom, Dad. See you in the morning. Good night, son. Our boys are so different. [chuckles] Yeah. I've never seen Dad as mad as he was today. Yeah, me either. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. So you've never done anything with Sara, except kiss? Yeah. Dude, you've dated for like two years. [chuckles] Well, I'm comfortable with waiting, and so is she. Do you ever wonder what they were like, our real mom and your real dad? Not really. I mean, I feel like my real mom and dad are right here. Yeah, me too. But I don't know, I guess just sometimes, I wonder why they did what they did to us, you know? Just left us like that? Sometimes I get mad. And when somebody says something, I just wanna bust 'em up, you know? Yeah, yeah. I still can't you believe you've never done anything with Sara. [chuckles] [Matt] Well, I think we should wait. Oh, don't go there again, man. It's a personal decision, Josh. I can't make it for you. Yeah, well, just don't start wearing an abstinence ring like those guys on TV, okay? -[book thuds] -[door slams] I say we fire him now. Four years of losing is enough. Players uninspired. Bleachers half-empty. It's time to let him go. I agree. I don't think we should be so quick to judge. We need to get a real coach in here. Somebody like Stan Taylor from over at Lakeview. He'll turn this program around. [people chattering] All right, everybody, hold it down just for a second, if you would. I'd like to hear what Mr. Richardson has to say. I think you folks should just simmer down. [Man] Simmer down? It seems some of you forgot about the teams Joe used to coach several years back. I don't recall anybody complaining about him then. That was then, this is now. I'm inclined to agree with Mr. Hunt. Mr. Richardson, those were good teams. Nobody denies that. But not great teams. We never made it out of the second round of the playoffs. Four losing seasons is a long time to wait. Don't you agree? I'm listening, Mr. Davies. Well, it's no secret to anybody in this room that winning is good for business. It generates revenue and popularity for all the athletic departments. I thought our first priority was to give young folks an education here, not to run a popularity contest, to bring in money. Now, look. I understand you wanna win basketball games and to put the school on the map. So do I. And I have just the man to help us do it. [Hunt] Who? Tex Summer. Tex Summer? I thought he was dead. I remember him. Are you sure he's still around? He took Campway High to state finals twice in four years, but that was over 25 years ago. Don't you think he's a little old to be our head coach? I didn't say head coach. What did you say? Look. I still have a lot of faith in Joe Conaghey. I propose we hire Tex to be his assistant and see if he can become a winner again. I mean, even coaches need coaching sometimes. -Oh, come on, Chester. -[table bangs] I say Tex Summer is a man we need to help Joe get us back on track and that's final. Now, we still have a few games before district starts. And it's your job to make sure Coach Conaghey goes along with it. Yes, sir. -By the way, Osmond, -[engaging music] I understand you need some restoration done on the roof of the gymnasium? I'll have my secretary draw you a check for that first thing in the morning. Good day to you, ladies and gentlemen. [Tex] So, that's where I came in and introduced 'em all to the oval offense. Okay, like oval office. [laughs] Now, let's not get presidential about this. I'm talking about the oval offense. Oval like an egg. See, the white is a perimeter and the yolk is the center. You rotate the ball around the oval. Uh-huh,-work on your core strength. You see, the white is fluid, but the yolk remains firm. Unless, of course, you break it, which you never wanna do. The players rotate the ball around that fluid oval 'til someone gets open for a shot. [Joe] Oval like an egg. [Tex] That's right. And I'll bet you're the chicken that laid that egg. [chuckles] Well, I've never thought about it that way, but I suppose I am. Tex, you excuse me for a minute? Sure thing. -Hey, Os. -Joe. I know why Tex is here, and I can appreciate that. But he sounds like a crazy old man to me. Well, you know, in his days down in Houston, they called him a basketball genius. Which I guess makes him a little crazy then. [Joe] Come on. He led 'em to two state championships, you know that, right? Yeah, back when they're shooting in peach baskets. Those days have come and gone. The game has changed. Well, you better figure out a way to make it work, because if he's not staying, you're both leaving. [Tex] It took awhile for Joe and the boys to accept me. [Joe] All right, come on. [Tex] And get into the rhythm of the oval. [players chattering] Good, good. Set it up again. Josh, run the two. [players chattering] [whistle blaring] Josh, move the ball around the oval. There's your open man right there. Don't take the low percentage shot. Yeah, but Coach, when I take the shot, it's never low percentage, you know what I'm sayin'? [players cheering] Tex. Tim, run it again for me, please. [Tim] All right, let's run that again. Look, I respect your experience and what you're trying to do here, but I'm head coach. Everything goes through me. Yes, sir, and I agree. But if you can get your boy Josh to commit to the oval, the rest of the team will follow suit. Now, Josh is your best player, but he's selfish. He won't pass the ball. Hey, everybody. Line up. Three man weaves, let's go. Hurry it up, come on. I've just been informed that Joe's not paying any attention to the old man. So what's the point? I say we fire Joe and put Tex in charge. [sighs] Well, you may be right. I tell you what, things don't get any better, I'll go to Richardson with your recommendation. [soft music] I didn't even get to interview him. The Board just forced him on me. Maybe they didn't. What do you mean? Well, maybe it's a blessing. You were doubting your coaching ability. This could be the answer. Answer to what? You asked for guidance on how to be a better coach. Give him a chance, Joe. Tex, I need to talk to you. Sure thing. I owe you an apology. For what, son? I haven't been fair to you, and I suppose I felt a little threatened with you being here and everything. Nah, it's completely natural. Head coach under the gun. You know, I'm not here to upstage you, Joe. I'm only here to help. I wouldn't want your job for all the beef in Texas. [laughing] Yeah, I can't help but believe you. Basketball starts up here. Your job is to get inside your players' heads. You do that, everything else will follow. Let's get started. Let's go. Josh. Jordan, hurry up and get out there. I want you to give Tex your full attention. I want you to learn his offense. All right. You're a leader of this team, and I want you to help your brother. Help him do what? Build his confidence, and everybody else on this team. But I haven't dissed him in a long time, Dad. Sometimes you don't have say anything. It's all on your face. Look, we can't win playoffs one on five. It's a team effort, it's mutual respect. You got it? Yes, sir. All right, let's go. All right, guys, bring it in, come on. [buzzer blaring] -[engaging music] -[crowd cheering] [Trent] Hi-Top, it's not much better for the Wildcats. New assistant coach Tex Summers trying to breathe some life into the Wildcat offense. [Hi-Top] Well, he's gotta blow harder. The boys just aren't responding. [Trent] With that free throw, DeSoto now leads by seven, with under a minute to play. Matt runs the ball up center court. Crossing the time line. He passes to his brother Josh. Josh, pass the ball! What are you doing? [Hi-Top] Oh, turn-over again. -[crowd cheering] -[crowd chanting] [Trent] DeSoto pass breaks down the court for an uncontested shot in the corner. Ouch. Oh, I tell you, Hi-Top. The Wildcats are looking for anything to work. [Hi-Top] Look harder. [Trent] Ball being brought down center court. Looking for an open man. [Joe] Hondo, work the ball inside. [Trent] Hondo takes it on the right time line. Takes it inside, inside to Mark Brown with a little baby left hook, he misses it. Oh, Hi-Top, it's been that kind of day for this team. [Hi-Top] I'm afraid that's the kind of year we're in store for. Despite a big scoring night from junior Josh Conaghey, the Wildcats are going O and two. We are no better off than we were before. Yeah, I know that, Kirby. I can see that. This whole Joe Conaghey thing, it's a bust. Well, what do you want me to do? -Clean house? -Yes! That's not gonna happen. Chester Richardson is our biggest benefactor. Listen, Kirby, I'm not gonna fire Joe Conaghey before the season even starts. You understand that, right? Just because Chester Richardson is rich. That's not what I said. I didn't say that. Tex Summers's a hack. Yeah, well, Tex just got here. Far as I'm concerned, he gets more time. -More time? -That's right. That's right. Now, they don't produce after that, I will fire them both. I don't care what ChesterRichardson has to say about it. -[soft music] -Okay? Okay. Matt, Josh, wait up. You saw the game, right? We lost. Hey, Sara, you look hot. Stop it, Josh. Listen, both of you. I just heard Mr. Hunt and Mr. Davies talking about your dad. Not in a good way. He's under a lot of pressure. You know, the school board wants him to win, -and we just don't-- -Forget them. It's fine. It's not fine. That's your dad they're talking about. Maybe you both should support him. Hey. All they want is results, and I had twenty-twelve. [Matt scoffs] Josh, Matt, supper. -Thank you. -Mm-hmm. You're late, where's your brother? Well, I don't know. I'll get him. [Laura] Your supper's getting cold. [soft music] It's all right, I'm not hungry. Dad send you out here? No, I sent myself. What's up? It's always about Josh, Mom. I mean, everything is just always about him. It's not true. It's about our family and about the team. And you are an important part of both. It doesn't seem like that. You're a good player, Matthew. But I'm not as good as he is. I mean, you know it. Who got invited to the Dallas Showcase? Hondo and Josh. Not me. You remember when he used to take you guys to the lake? And what a good swimmer you became? And you and Josh used to race to the dock? You beat him every time. Maybe I should have joined the swim team. Listen to me, Matthew. Your brother has a talent. Youhave a talent. Accept it. Be glad. Don't be jealous. -I'm not jealous. -Use your talents. Never give up. Think about that. Okay. Come inside and eat.

This is NBA great, Rolando Blackman. Popeye Jones. Every scout, coach, general manager worth his salt has been here for three days, across our great land, to watch you guys play basketball. And on behalf of HeroesBasketball and the Cuban Center, I just wanna thank you guys for your hard work. [applauding] Now, you guys have shown great focus, great intensity throughout this whole camp. What's important right now is that you do the job playing the game of team basketball and continue that forward. That's what's most important. You guys always know that you need each other. Pop? Gentlemen, great job. Let's bring it in. Come on, bring it in, let's bring it in. Hard work on three. One, two, three. [All] Hard work! -Yeah! -[people chattering] Coach Taylor? Josh Conaghey. I play for Woodrow Wilson. Yeah, I know who you are. You did some nice work out there today, son. Any coach would be lucky to have you. Thank you, sir. Do you think I could have a word with you? Well, sure. Well, playing for a small school means that I don't get the opportunity to play for a lot of people. Important people, that is. And I would love for the chance to play in Dallas. Look son, I'm not one to beat around the bush, but if I tried to get you to play for me, I'll be in violation of school recruitment regulations. Now, I do have an open spot in my roster, but you have to have a legal guardian in the district in order to transfer to Lakeview. Now, if you were able to make all those things happen, with no interference from me and no assistance from me of any kind then I'd like to see you in a Lakeview uniform. That's awesome, sir. Now, just to clarify. You haven't started district play yet, right? -No, sir. -Well, good. Well then Lakeview will be atremendous opportunity for you. We have plenty of college scouts at our ballgames. Well, that's great, sir. I need to talk to my dad, but I'll try to make this work. I don't even think Coach Conaghey would deny, playing for Lakeview would be the chance of a lifetime. But, if he wants to call me, here's my card. I'll do my best to make this happen. And, Josh, once district play starts, it'll be too late. Oh, I'll get right back to you. Good. [Tex] Now Josh was just a junior, a year younger than Matt, but he was a natural. Matt, on the other hand, had to work real hard for it. And he still could never do enough to match the magic of his brother. The team was getting the hang ofthe offense. But Josh was like a young, headstrong stallion. And a twist of fate was about to happen. I just wouldn't want to see youmiss an opportunity to shine, make the playoffs with us. But I'll shine up there. Coach Taylor said he had one spot. One. And he's looking at other players. You might spend a season on the bench, or you might not make the team at all. I'll make the team, Dad. I don't get it, I thought you wanted the best for me. I do. I do. I just don't think this is the right thing for you right now. The right thing for you,you mean. I have a chance to do something really big here. I could get a D-One scholarship. I just think you're too young to make this choice. You just want me to hang out here, in this hick town and go nowhere, just so you can look good? You can forget it. I'm going. [Laura] He could stay with my Aunt Julie. [scoffs] No. [Laura] She lives in the district. No, I don't want to put that burden on her. She'd have to be his legal guardian, for him to go to school up there. She wouldn't mind. I'm worried about her keeping up with him. She's 80-years old. She's only 76. Yeah, [chuckles] only seventy-six. It won't be a problem. It'll be a blessing. Aunt Julie's been alone for almost five years since Uncle Willie died. It'll be good for her, and for Josh. Oh, admit it, Joe. As much as we don't wanna let him go, this could be a really big break for him. And if we don't let him try, he'll never know. He might hate us for that. Are you afraid of what will happen if he leaves the team? [soft music] I'm afraid of him failing. He's never played for anybody else before. My stomach churns just thinking about him playing for Stan Taylor. Stan Taylor. You can't protect him forever. I think we should let him make his own decision and then stand by him. [Matt] Good luck in Dallas. Thanks. Wish you weren't going. I would have thought this wouldbe the best thing for you. With me not hogging the ball all the time, this is your chance to step up. I'm still gonna miss you. It's your team now. Trust yourself. I got this for you. [soft music] [Josh] Thanks, Matt. [Laura] Did you say goodbye to your brother? -Yes, ma'am. -Did you get your Bible? Yeah, a gift from Matt. Okay, do your best, son. [Josh] I will. [Laura] Okay. I'll see you later, honey. [Laura] You guys drive friendly, okay? Call me when you get there? [engine firing] -[door squeaking] [Osmond] Now, Kirby, you're just not listening to me. Osmond, the man is clearly incompetent. He just let one of our best players go to some dad-blamed school in Dallas. Well, it's his son. He can do whatever he wants with him. He should have stopped him. Now, why? Why would he do that? It's a chance for something better. We need something better, and letting that boy go just killed our chances. Our season is over before it even begins. Kirby, calm down. I'm not gonna calm down. Listen to me, Joe is not going anywhere. Why not? The Board and I agree that Conaghey should be fired before the district games start next week, so we get a real coach in here and start a whole new program. That's not gonna happen. I made a deal with Chester. Why do you keep kissing Chester's butt? Do what's right, man. Oh, I am gonna do what's right. Starting right now. Now, you gentlemen enjoy the rest of your day. [engaging music] [bell ringing] We're glad to have you aboard. Welcome to Patriots Country. Thank you, sir. You all settled in at your aunt's? -Yes, sir. -Good. Well, first practice is Monday at four o'clock, and we'll see you there. Looking forward to it. By the way, how's that dad of yours? Oh, he's doing fine. Good. Good. Hi. Hi. [laughs] Josh, now you be sure and put your dirty laundry in that wicker basket by the stairs. Yes, ma'am. And I know you have practice every day, so I'll have dinner ready at seven. If you're going to be later, you call me. I will. I know you don't have a car. So, you can use one of my bikes, if you'd like. You have bikes? Three of 'em. I like to ride. Keeps me in shape. Now, if you need anything, you just let me know. I will. Thanks, Aunt Julie. Now, you put that in the trash out there in the back, okay? -All right. -All right. What's that thing do again? Pumps insulin and keeps my diabetes in check. Does it hurt? No, not at all. It just helps melive a normal life. Let's go get swole. Hey, how you think Josh is doing in Dallas? [X] Superstar? [laughing] I'm sure he'll be fine. Do y'all even think we can make it without him? Yeah, man. What do you say, Matt? Of course we can, all right? Don't even ask that question. Now, come on guys. You have to have more faith in us than that. Chill out, man. Put some more weight on this thing. -[players grumbling] -All right. Big talk, let's see it. You can't get that. Let's see it, big dog. Now, listen up, listen up. If we don't start focusing, we're not going anywhere. And that is too much weight for you, man. -What? -That's too much weight. What are you? [laughs] -[player grunting] -All right, do it again. [groaning] [players cheering] Hercules, Hercules. [upbeat dance music] Hi. I'm Heather. I'm glad you could make it. Welcome to Lakeview. Molly, Randy, this is Josh. What's up, man? I'm Randy Toth, team captain. Welcome to the Patriots. Thanks. Heard you made an impression on the coaching staff, man. Ah, I just wanna play. That's good, man, I like that attitude. Hey, everybody. Come meet the new guy. It's Josh Conaghey. I'm Keeshon. Welcome. Hi, man, I'm Keenan. Harry. Josh. [Randy] Coach Taylor hand-picked this guy. You must be pretty good then, huh? I'm all right. We'll soon see, won't we? You must be Josh. -Hey, Erin -What's up? Excuse us. -[people chattering] -Mmmmm. I'm Erin. Well then, nice to meet you. So. What do you think, country boy? You look great. [chuckles] I know that. I meant, Lakeview. Oh. [chuckles] I'm excited. About what? Playing with a little rubber ball? See you later... Josh. [Tex] Every man meets his Delilah, at least once in his life. And Josh Conaghey met his. [whistle blaring] [shoes squeaking] [players chattering] [Player] So, have you seen the rookie yet? -No, not yet. -[whistle blaring] Randy, you're out. -Josh, you're in. -[engaging music] Hey, don't worry about all them, man. You do what you do, all right? Okay, run zipper seven again. Set it up top. Let's go. [whistle blaring] Get that weak stuff outta here. Next time, pass the ball. Conaghey, set it up again. Good start today. Let's hit the showers. Let's get home early and get on those books. No stopping along the way. Good job. Good practice, man. Yeah, it was a good job. [Josh] Just a dirty screen, Aunt Julie. -Works fine. -[Julie laughing] Bless your heart. You sure are handy to have around. I'm gonna set the table for dinner. You wash up. Okay. [sniffs] Ugh! -[people cheering] -[people chattering] [Trent] I tell you, Hi-Top. The district opener is proving to be a nail-biter. [Hi-Top] Yeah, since superstar Josh Conaghey left for the big city, the Wildcats finally resemble a team. [Trent] Cedar Hill up by one with nineteen seconds left. [Hi-Top] The defense must make a stop. [Trent] Cedar Hill looking to take it inside. -The shot. -Not in my house. That's what I'm talking about. [Trent] Oh, my! Thomas blocked the ball and Xavier White's there and passes to Alex for the layup. Wildcats up by one. Thirteen seconds left. Can the Wildcats hold on to win the first district game? -Defense [all clapping] -[Hi-Top] Just don't foul. [Trent] Oh, I tell you. It has never been louder here. Six seconds, Cedar Hill passes to the left. [Hi-Top] Watch the screen. [Trent] Smith gets the ball down low. But, ah, no, no! -Xavier fouls him. -[buzzer blaring] [Trent] Oh, my, with no time left, Smith is going to the line. The Wildcats are up by one, but Smith has two free throws. -Come on, X. -I'd like a replay, to see if he got fouled before the buzzer. Well the refs are getting everybody behind the line. [Hi-Top] You know, it's always harder to shoot with no one in the lane. [Trent] Yeah, Hi-Top, but Smith is an 80% plus free throw shooter. He takes the ball, he studies, he shoots. -[crowd groaning] -That tied it. [Trent] Well, Smith has one more for the win. [Hi-Top] Come on, Wildcats faithful. Yell. -[Hi-Top] Scream. -[Ref] One shot. [Trent] Smith steps up to the line. Gets his feet set. [crowd booing] This is a very important shot, to say the least. [Hi-Top] Oh, that one hurts, Trent. [Trent] Oh, Cedar Hill beats our Wildcats on two. Jason Smith free throws with no time left on the clock. [Hi-Top] The first district game, the first game without Josh Conaghey. [Trent] Hi-Top, what does Coach Conaghey say to his team after this one? All right, we're O and one in district. We still have a long season and a lot of work to do. We'll talk about that on Monday. Go and get some rest. A lot of work to do? I thought that's what the last month of practice was for. Josh was our best player, man. I don't get it. Listen, we're still a good team, all right? Man, how could your dad just let Josh go like that? -Yeah. -[Tex] Matt? May I have a word with you? [Matt] Yes, sir. [soft music] Don't worry about all the griping. That just means they wanna win. We need to take all this energyand focus on the positive. I'm sorry, sir, we? This is your chance to lead this team, Matt. The season isn't lost, unless you think it's lost. You need to take charge. Believe in your talent and trust the system. You can do this, son. I believe in you. Thanks, Coach. [Tex] Get it done. -Hey coach. -Hey. -[Matt] Hey. -Hey you. Everything okay? Yeah, yeah I think so. I'm gonna go change. Wait for me? Yeah. [Matt chuckles] [Joe] What'd Josh have to say? [Laura] That he misses us, but the team is good. He loves Aunt Julie, but he hates her cooking. If I remember correctly, so did you. I never said I hated her cooking. I said it was "eclectic cuisine." [chuckles] I hope we made the right decision by letting him go. What are you worried about? It's out of our hands. Yep. I just miss having him around. I can't believe I lost him to Stan Taylor. I know. He's growing up way quicker than I expected. What about the rest of the team? [sighs] I don't know if I can get it done without him. Now, we should have a winning season. But now, with the pressures of making the playoffs, and the Board's negativity is getting back to the boys and their parents. -I don't know. -[soft music] Maybe it's time I stepped down. After all the hard work you've put in? Maybe it's the best thing for everybody. I mean, now with the added distractions and the new assistant coach. I don't know. Maybe it's the right thing to do. Don't think that way. Everybody blames me for letting Josh go. And nothing's going the way it's supposed to. Sure it is. It just may not be happening the way that youthink it should. Why don't you call him on his cell? -[Laura] Mmmhmm. -That's a good idea. [chopping] Smells good. What is it? Your mother's favorite. Braised pork belly with honey and raspberry sauce. [cell phone ringing] Dad! Sorry Aunt Julie I gotta take this. Okay. Hey dad. Sure glad to hear from you. Mmm, there he is now. He is cute. Ooh, I think so, too. Just back off, girls. He's mine. For now. Why should we? Just do it. Whatever. Hey, country boy. Hi. Walk with me. You could walk with me. Or me. [chuckles] Ignore them. They're just jealous. How's it going? Great. Coach says he'll give me some playing time in the next game. That's exciting. So what are you doing this Saturday? Homework, helping my aunt with stuff around the house. [chuckles] That sounds boring. Think you'll get a chance to get away for a while? I guess so, why? We're having a party. Wanna come? Yeah, sure. -Yeah? -Where's it gonna be? Heather's parents are leaving town for the weekend and they're letting us use their house. Awesome. What time is it? Eight or nine. Things won't really get going 'til around 10. Ah, that, that's late. I have to be home by 11. [girls chuckling] 11? I haven't had to be home by 11 since the seventh grade. I'm sorry, I guess there's not much to do where you're from. No, I mean, there's plenty to do. It's just that, you know, my parents. Well, I mean, I could push it to 12. What kind of party is it? -A fun one. -[soft music] See you at my place. Bye. [bell ringing] [exhales loudly] [Josh] Okay, Aunt Julie, I'm off. Behave yourself. Don't stay out too late. I'll be home by 12. Your mother says 11. [chuckles] She keeps forgetting that I haven't had to be home by 11 since the seventh grade. Shall I call her? No, ma'am. [Julie] Who's picking you up? I was gonna take the bike? Okay, since you don't have a ride, I'll give you an extra thirty minutes, but don't mess with me or you'll get the frying pan. Yes, ma'am.

[engaging music] [Trent] I tell you, Hi-Top. The Wildcats have caught on fire after those early losses. [Hi-Top] Who'd think our district record would be six and two, looking like we're going to seven and two? [Trent] Jordan Green takes the ball from the wing and drives the middle. -Oh, my! -[crowd cheering] [Hi-Top] J.G. slams that one with authority. [Trent] And the Wildcats get another W. [Hi-Top] Coach Joe Conaghey finally has his Wildcat team headed in the right direction. -[music playing on car radio] -[kissing sounds] ♪ Gives me hope to carry on It's late.

[Josh laughs] You better go. [laughs] Well. -[door squeaking] -[soft music] [Aunt Julie] Josh. This isn't Saturday night, son. What are you doing coming in after 10 on a school night? I'm sorry I didn't call, Aunt Julie. I was late. I was working on free throws. Oh, don't. I know. Your coach wants you to come home after practice.

I'm sorry, it won't happen again. Now get on up to bed. [engaging music] [Trent] I can't say enough, Hi-Top, about how senior Matt Conaghey has stepped up to lead this Wildcat team. Matt passes to X. X-Man drives hard to the middle. He lifts. -He shoots. -[buzzer blaring] [Hi-Top] Get in there. [Trent] Inside, oh, it, it drops in! [Hi-Top] The Wildcats win at the buzzer. [Trent] Xavier hit the jumper. The Wildcats win again. [Hi-Top] This is the mostexcitement this school has seen since I played here. [Trent] And that was a long time ago, Hi-Top. -[Hi-Top laughing] -[people chattering] [cheerleaders] Let's go, let's go! Hey, son. How is everything? [Matt] Oh, everything's good. Should get some playing time in the next week. Oh, that's great, that's great. You want me to come up for a game? [Matt] Oh, let me get one game under my belt first. How's your season going? It's going better. We won three games in a row. Your brother, he has really stepped it up. I miss you. [Matt] Miss you too, Dad. [car horn beeping] -[upbeat music] -Hey. -Hey. -Hop in. Well, where are you going? Not me. Us, and we are going to a party. Now, hop in. [car alert beeping] -[players chattering] -[shoes squeaking] -[whistle blaring] -All right, good job. Trey, you have got to help on defense, man. -Sorry, Coach. -Go! Mr. Conaghey, nice of you to join us. This is the second time this week you have been late to practice. If you want to be part of this team, you have got to get focused or I'm gonna cut you. You got it? Yes, sir. Good. All right, set it up. Set it up! [whistle blaring] And once again, in spite of seemingly impossible odds, General MacArthur spearheaded this operation. Well, that concludes our overview of the Korean War, but what about that Battle of Inchon? -[book slams] -[Josh gasps] Mr. Conaghey, can you tell us about the Battle of Inchon?

Oh, I could whip something up at home. No, thank you, Aunt Julie. It's Christmas Eve. That's a great idea, Dad. I hope Josh wasn't any trouble. Oh, no, no. He knows I'd box his ears if he was. [laughs] Yes, ma'am. I can't wait to come up here and watch you play. Yeah, me too. I'm glad the Wildcats are doing so well. Oh, yeah, man, it's been tough, but things are really starting to gel, you know. Hey Josh, come here. Hey. What's up? Just getting ready for school. [tense music] Josh. We need a word with you. Boys, excuse us. [players groaning] Am I in trouble? It's beyond that, son. Mr. Fallon saw you today with some other students. But I didn't do anything. It doesn't matter if you did or you didn't. We have a zero tolerance policy here, son. -That's it, you're out. -But-- Your behavior just hasn't been right lately. I think you know that. You need to get some help, Josh. We're gonna be sending a letter to your aunt, announcing your expulsion. You need to clear out your locker before you leave the campus. Now, I need your signature on this. And you can have a copy to keep. [Erin chuckling] Where have you been? I waited almost an hour. [indifferent] Sorry. Hold on, I needed to talk to you. About what? -I told you it was important. -[dramatic music] I won't be long. I'll meet you guys at Heather's. [chuckles] Whatever. So guess what? I made cheerleader. Great. That's great. Now what was so important? I got busted. I heard. And you're off the team. Yeah. Yeah, can we go somewhere and talk about this? No. I don't think that's a good idea. What do you mean, a good idea? I mean, I don't think I should be seeing you anymore. What? Listen. I thought you were cool, but I guess all those rumors about country boys being dumb are right, huh? I can't believe you just said that. Believe it. Listen, we were getting stale anyway. Now that I made cheerleader, I gotta protect my image. Can't being hanging around a loser. You got busted. You're trouble. [Marshall] Hey, Erin. Hey, Marshall, can you take me to Heather's? Sure. [whistle blaring] [Trent] And that's gonna do it, as Parish dribbles out the clock. Losing by 23. -[buzzer blaring] -Their second in a row. [crowd groaning] [whistle blaring] [Tex] Back home, things weren'tfairing too well either. Mr. Momentum had changed jerseys and the team's winning streak came to an end. It seemed like their season was all but over. We lose one more game, and we're out of the playoffs. Don't go there, Matt. Trust your God-given talent. You're assistant coach, say something. Well, boys. There's a time in every person's life when it seems like no matter what they try to do, nothing seems to change. But boys, you can't keep winning all the time. And you can't keep losing all the time either. Unless you quit. So quit it. Now, go get changed. Tex. "Just quit it"? -Yeah. -Just--? That's genius. That's just genius. Yeah, Mom. Just tell Dad to pick me up at the station. Okay, love you too. What did Coach Stanton say, when you told him you wanted to go home? He wasn't too happy, but he understood. I know you'll be glad to get back with your family. I'm gonna go upstairs, finish packing. [soft music] You be sure and call me when you get home, you hear? Thanks for everything, Aunt Julie. [Julie] Oh. You bet. [Tex] Josh was alone. And afraid he could never go home again. So he took the easy way out, by running away. [Junkie] Hey man, want some dope? Come on, buy some dope. [somber music] [Trent] In this first half against the heavily favored Heroes, the Wildcats have played with incredible energy. [Hi-Top] Trent, that's 'cause they know if they lose, they won't make the playoffs. [Trent] Hi-Top, it's been a great defensive battle. Back and forth between the Wildcats and the Heroes. [Hi-Top] Defense is how you win. Winner of this game may be the team who has the last possession. [Trent] And with that shot, the Wildcats have tied the Heroes! Alright listen up, guys. Tex. You played a good half, boys. But remember, don't hold the ball too long. Rotation, crisp passes, cut through the lane. Be patient and something will open up. Coach? Let's go finish this game. [ominous music] Kid, take that. And don't be late tomorrow. No, sir, I won't. Take that to the dumpster. Yes, sir. [Trent] The Wildcats now trail by one, and they have the last possession. [Hi-Top] They're running Tex Summers' oval offense, trying to give Matt the ball. [Trent] Matt clears through the screens. Gets the pass, spins, shoots. -[buzzer blaring] -It's in. [crowd cheering] [Trent] Wildcats win. Hi-Top, these Wildcats just do not quit. [Hi-Top] This is a game they were not supposed to win, Trent. [Trent] Oh, but somehow they found a way. [Hi-Top] Yeah, they did. On the back of senior Matt Conaghey. [Trent] He has definitely come into his own, since his brother Josh transferred to Dallas. [Hi-Top] What a day for the Wildcat fans. [Trent] And especially Coach Conaghey and his son, Matthew. [dramatic music] [garbage rustling] [bangs dumpster] [Aunt Julie on phone] Laura, I just spoke to the school and got the whole story. You can't blame yourself, Julie, okay? You call the police in Dallas and I'll call 'em here. I already have. We'll find him. I just, I'm worried 'cause he must be in trouble, or he wouldn't have made up such a lie. If anything happens to that boy, I'll never forgive myself. Um, I have to go find Joe. I'll call you later, okay? -Bye. -[phone beeps] Oh, my God, what's wrong? -[Laura crying] -What's wrong? [people chattering] [gagging] [groans] I reported him missing to the police. You keep trying his cell phone. I have, but he's not answering. I just can't believe this, Joe. Neither can I, but we gotta get him home. He must be in so much pain. All the more reason to get him home as soon as possible. I'm gonna go by the school, and I'm gonna tell Tex what's going on. Then I'm going to Dallas. I'm coming with you. -No, you're not. -No, I'm coming with you. No, you're not. You're gonna stay here by the phone. If you hear anything, you call me. [sobs] Joe. -[door slams] -[engine starting] [slow engaging music] [Tex] Joe searched high and low,all over the city, for his son. But his search was in vein. Josh was alone, afraid and ashamed.

I'm just so glad you're back. [Josh sniffles] I was afraid to come back. I was afraid you wouldn't love me anymore. I was afraid you'd never forgive me. I could never stop loving you. I forgive you. No strings, no conditions. So you're not mad? [both sniffling] No, I'm not mad. But we willdiscuss this when we get home. So you got expelled from Lakeview. Yes, sir. And Coach Stan took you off the roster? Yes, sir. He made me sign this. You wanna play tonight? -What? -Do you wanna play tonight? -Yeah. -Then go get suited up. This piece of paper makes it legal.

How are you gonna forgive him after everything he's done to you? Matt, he came home. What'd you want me to do? I don't know, but, he doesn't care about us, Dad. He cares about himself. That's it. Matt, please. Matt. You're my oldest, you're my rock. I can always count on you. Everything I have is yours, but your brother was a lostsoul, and now he's found again. And right now, he needs all our love and support. Dad, I've worked so hard and you, you're just gonna let him come back and act like nothing happened. I know, but I would have done the same for you. That's not fair. That's not fair. Whatever happened taught Josh a valuable lesson, and I don't think punishing him is gonna change anything. And I forgive him. You need to do the same. I gotta go call your mother. [ominous music] Matt, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I hurt you. You know, when I ran away, I was really scared. And I thought, what would you do? Because you always seem to make better decisions. And I really look up to you. I love you, Josh. Come here. All right, you're my brother, all right? Welcome back, brother. Welcome back. Amen, brother! -[players laughing] -[players cheering] All right. [yells] Calm down, calm down. Listen up, listen up. I'm sure you know by now that Josh is back on the team. [players cheering] Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know. No matter what happens tonight, we're gonna have a party at my house. Win or lose, we're gonna celebrate. [players chattering] We're gonna win! We're gonna win! Guys, this is for the playoffs. -Playoffs! -[players chattering] ♪ Uh-oh, uh-oh -♪ They want us, yeah -Matt! -♪ They got us, yeah -Matt! ♪ They want us, yeah ♪ They got us, yeah -♪ Uh-oh, uh-oh -Go get dressed, son. ♪ Ooh, ah, yeah, it's on ♪ Ooh, ah, yeah, it's on ♪ Ooh, ah, yeah, it's on ♪ [Trent] I tell you, Hi-Top. Could it be any bigger than this? The last district game. The final minute. [Hi-Top] And we're all tied up, Trent. [Trent] Josh Conaghey is back playing with the team, but Texas High has the ball. [Hi-Top] Trent, they're running through their offense, taking valuable time off the clock and working for that last shot. [Trent] Coming off the pick, Dion Houston takes the pass, pulls up. Ow! [Hi-Top] That's too easy. You've got to contest every shot. [Trent] Well, the Wildcats are down by two. [Hi-Top] They may have scored too quick, Trent. We need a two to tie or a three to win. Matt crosses the half court line, passes to Josh, who drives the middle and looks like he's gonna take the opening shot, but instead he passes in the corner to his brother, Matt, who takes a three-pointer! [buzzer blaring] -It's in! -[crowd cheering] Matt Conaghey buries the three. [Hi-Top] He made it. The Wildcats are going to the playoffs. The Wildcats are going to the playoffs! [Trent] Hi-Top, I don't think there's anybody in this gym, player, coach, or fan, that didn't think Josh Conaghey was gonna take that last shot. [Hi-Top] But instead he passed off to his older brother, who hit the open shot. [Trent] And like your teams, Hi-Top, back in the day, the Wildcats are going to the playoffs! Yeah, Matt Conaghey was a hero that night. And the Wildcats made the playoffs. And Josh Conaghey finally found the open man. -[bright music playing] ♪ You've gotta have faith I wanna thank you, Osmond, for sticking with the plan. Oh, I appreciate that, Chester. I really do, thank you. Now, if I'm not mistaken, we need new uniforms for the football team. Well, I've heard some people mention that, yeah. Well, I guess we're gonna have to look into that, won't we? Yes, sir, I guess we will. All right, listen up, everybody. Listen up. First, I wanna thank the manupstairs for my beautiful wife, my two sons, Tex Summer, my amazing team. [crowd applauding] Our hard work paid off, and now it's off to the playoffs! [all cheering] -Yeah! -Yeah! Hey, I kinda had a hunch it was gonna work out like this. You probably knew all along, didn't you? No, I didn't know anything. I just had faith. You oughta try it sometimes. Joe coached some great games all throughout the playoffs. The boys never played better. And that's it. What, wait, no, what about the state finals? Well, okay. Who do you think we played? I don't know. Who? Just like in a Hollywood movie. None other than the Lakeview Patriots. -[engaging music] -[crowd cheering] [Trent] Well, Hi-Top, here we are, and David versus Goliath comes to mind, as our Wildcats take on the Lakeview Centennial Patriots, coached by the great Stan Taylor. [Hi-Top] Take that, Stan. [Trent] That's a dunk by Josh Conaghey. Remember it was just three weeks ago that Conaghey played for Lakeview. [Hi-Top] Yeah, well, we're glad to have him back where he belongs. Lakeview's big center, Jeff Grizell, is unstoppable. [Hi-Top] He is scoring at will. Coach Conaghey's gonna have to make adjustments at halftime, Trent. [Trent] Lakeview leads by six in the closing minutes of the first half, as the Wildcats bring up the ball. [Hi-Top] The Wildcats are getting good shots, but they're just not falling. Come on, come on. [Trent] Lakeview brings the ball up to court for the final look of the first half. [Hi-Top] You know what I'd do, I'd double team Patriot captain Randy Toth. [Trent] Toth spots up on the left wing. [buzzer blaring] He shoots a long free and hits as the buzzer sounds. [Hi-Top] Oh, this is not how the Wildcats wanted to end the first half. Oh, Coach Taylor couldn't be happier with the play of his Patriots. Going to the locker room with an 11-point lead. [crowd cheering] Wisdom, knowledge. Knowledge is knowing the facts, gentlemen. And wisdom is knowing what to do with those facts. Now, it's common knowledge. It's a fact that this team knows how to play basketball. We wouldn't be here, gentlemen,if that wasn't the truth. But it's how we implement the wisdom of our preparation. How we rely on one another and how we honor our school, which is ultimately gonna determine whether we bring home a victory. [soft music] Now, I could stand up here, and I can give you a cliche speech of how all the papers and all the sportswriters are saying how the Patriots are gonna take home another state championship. Y'all are too smart for that. I promise you, you are here, 'cause you are supposed to be here. You can believe that. Look at the man next to you. Go ahead. Take his hand. I love each and every one of you like you're my own son. Y'all are all brothers. Bring it in. [Coach Conaghey] Ok, men. We've come a long ways to get to this point. We've learned some toughlessons, but we've come together as a family. And as a family we can count on each other, trust each other, no matter what. -Let's break. -[all] Break! Let's go win a ballgame, boys. -[players cheering] -[players chattering] This is your team now, Joe. You don't need me anymore. You, my friend, have all the wisdom you need. -[engaging music] -[crowd cheering] [Trent] Welcome back to the second half of the state final championship game between the heavily-favored Lakeview Centennial Patriots and your Woodrow Wilson Wildcats. [Hi-Top] Even though Matt Conaghey missed that shot, the Wildcats are playing it patient, Trent. [Trent] With four minutes left to play, the Patriots bring the ball up. Oh, that's an alley-oop to Darius Singleton! [Hi-Top] The Wildcats continue to have trouble -with the Patriots' size -Timeout! -And talent. -Time out! [Trent] Coach Joe Conaghey takes a time out. Get in here, come on. [Hi-Top] My guess is he wants to get his team focused for the final minutes. Come on, come on. Get in here. All right, look up. Look at me, guys, come on, look at me. -Having fun, right? -[triumphant music] This is fun. -Isn't it? -Yeah. It is. All these people, look at 'em, look at 'em. All these people came to watch you guys play. All right? Enjoy yourself. Have fun. Who's got talent? [Players] We do. -Who's got talent? -We do! -Who's got talent? -We do! Get out there and play some ball! One, two, three. -Wildcats! -[crowd cheering] -Come on, guys! -[engaging music] [Trent] Okay, we're back from the timeout. [Hi-Top] Did you notice a change when they broke from the huddle? [Trent] I sure did, Hi-Top. They looked like they believe they can win this game. Oh, look at it, a slam dunk by Thomas Gibson. [Hi-Top] These boys aren't rolling over. [Trent] And the Patriot lead is dwindling. [Hi-Top] Coach Stan Taylor is starting to sweat. [Trent] Less than two minutes left to play. Another steal by the Wildcats! [Hi-Top] Lead cut it to two with this possession. [Trent] Canamis and Lopez. Oh, my! [Hi-Top] Did you see that? A perfect alley-oop to a streaking Jordan Green, cutting the Patriot lead to two! [Trent] Patriot defense. Again, Matthew Conaghey steals the ball and smartly calls timeout with eight seconds to play. [Hi-Top] This arena is going crazy. [Trent] The Wildcat fans can't believe they're in this game. [Hi-Top] And the Patriot fans can't believe they're blowing the game. Come on, come on, come on, come on. All right, all right, all right. You guys are looking better out there, okay? We had this, we had this. And you let 'em back in the game. We got sloppy. They don't even belong on the same floor as us. -Hondo, what do we do? -We? Well, we've got the ball, so they're gonna press. Okay, okay. Jordan, how do we break the press? Pass away from the double team and hit the open man. We know they're going to Josh. Randy, I want you in his jersey, you got it? Yes, sir. Okay, everyone. Fists up, man-to-man, deny Josh Conaghey the ball. -You got it? -Yes, sir. Well, let's go do it then. -[players chattering] -[players cheering] -One, two, three. -Wildcats! [crowd cheering] All right. Defense! [Hi-Top] Everybody in this gym knows that Josh Conaghey is gonna get the ball. Hey, Conaghey. You're nothing but a country bastard anyways. [Trent] And Lakeview team captain Randy Toth is set to guard Josh. Matt Conaghey dribbles the ball up court under extreme pressure. [Hi-Top] Six seconds left. [Trent] Matt Conaghey looks to break the press, finds the open man, Josh Conaghey, who spots up on the wing, sidesteps his defender, pulls up, and shoots a long three-pointer! [Hi-Top] He got it off. And? You really don't know, do you? Oh, come on, Tex, you're killing me. What happened? -[buzzer blaring] -[crowd cheering] [Trent] Oh, my! -He made it! -[triumphant music] [Trent] He made it! Josh Conaghey made the game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. [Hi-Top] Wildcats win! [Trent] They are they new state champions! This was nothing short of a miracle. [Hi-Top] I'll tell you, these players, these coaches, and these fans will have something to be proud of and something they can carry with them for the rest of their lives. You, you brother. [Tex] See, both those boys discovered unconditional love and forgiveness. They never looked at eachother quite the same way again. Why don't you just let it all simmer a little bit? Okay. You know, I think you're gonna make a fine sportswriter. Thank you, Mr. Summer. Nah, just plain Tex. Tex, it is. [laughs] [birds chirping] -Thank you. -Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
