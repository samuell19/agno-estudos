(lively music) (Freddy whistling) (Saul howls) (Freddy gasps) - Freddy? Freddy, I was only joking. (Freddy gasps) Oh... Lana caterpillar. - What's happened? - Freddy has fainted. - Oh... I better go home. - Oh Lana, don't run away. You always run away. (mischievous laugh) - What's the matter Saul? You got problems? - Oh no, go away, you never help anyway. - Oh, but I'm, I'm always available. (yells) He bit me, hit bit me! - Wanna fight? - No, Freddy needs help. - Freddy? Who cares? (cries) - Freddy! - Saul, I just saw the most terrible monster. - [Saul] It was me, Freddy. - Well, I hope you learned a lesson. - I learned how hard it is to get help when you're in trouble. - And you are my purple, furry, good Samaritan. - What's a good Samara-raritan? - It's in the Bible! About a guy who's really in trouble and no one would help him. - Like me? - Like you. - Tell me about it, Freddy. - [George] Good David, the sound is working perfectly. - Thanks, George. - With all you're doing to raise money for the center, I wish I could do more. My kids never miss your TV show. They can't believe that I grew up with the man behind the famous Wiemer Puppets. - Well, we're all ready. - We've got an hour, how about some coffee? - Sounds good. - Boy, it's great to have you back. But I can't see how working here all summer is much of a vacation. - Well, I like to work in front of a live audience. It keeps me on my toes. Besides, I like coming back to the old hometown. - [George] I wish you'd let us pay you something. - Bring your kids, that's payment enough. - Hiya kids! See ya at this afternoon's show. A little change from basketball, huh? - This sign says no basketball practice for eight weeks. - That's right, we've got David Wiemer. You know, the TV show. The children's story hour. Wiemer Puppets? Well, maybe you're a little old. Come to the show this afternoon. Oh, put that notice back up will you, Todd? Boy, the things we're gonna prove around here with that money, David. (ominous music) You'll never know how great it is what you're doing. - [Todd] Let's get outta here. - We need some new equipment for the teams which we haven't been able to swing for five years and we've been trying to get that parking lot re-serviced but just haven't had the bread so that's second on the list. And if there's anything left after that, it goes to the nursery department for educational toys to the little kids. I hope this experience is as great for you as it is for us. ♫ Jesus loves the little children (Saul humming) Oh no! - Surprise! (Saul yells) - [Saul] Bobby is picking on me! (Saul cries) - [Freddy] Saul? - I'm leaving if that goody goody is coming. - [Saul] Good. - Saul? Saul? Saul, where are you? Oh, Saul! - I'm going Kevin. - [Freddy] Saul! - I'll be home at nine when the library closes. - [Freddy] Oh, poor Saul! Oh, let me help you. (Saul cries) - Be sure Alice is in bed by eight, Kevin. - [Freddy] Did Bobby bop you again? - Bye sweetheart. - [Saul] He hit my nose. (cries) - Well, he's your brother. You have to forgive him. - [Saul] No I don't! - [Freddy] Jesus said you'd have to turn the other cheek. (phone rings) - [Saul] Then he will just hit me again! - Hello. (Saul cries) I can't, I'm stuck with Alice. - [Freddy] What do you want to do? - Okay, I'll be there. Give me a minute. (mischievous music) Okay, bye. - [Saul] I wanna bop his wad! - Alice, I gotta go out. - [Freddy] That'd be wrong Saul. - Put your pajamas on and go to bed. I'll be back soon. - But it would make me feel good. (ominous music) (playful music) (whistling) - Ooh. Pow! (whistling) (mischievously laughs) Goodnight, David. Goodnight, Saul. (lighthearted music) ♫ Jesus loves the little children ♫ All the children of the world ♫ Red and yellow, black and white ♫ They are precious in his sight ♫ Jesus loves the little children of the world ♫ Jesus loves the little children ♫ All the children of the world (dramatic music) (clattering) (moves into suspenseful music) - [Man At Door] Burglars in the studio. Call the police. - No don't hurt Saul! No don't hurt Saul, no! No, don't! Don't hurt Saul! - Get her outta here. Go! Get her outta here. Go, come on. (ominous music) - [Officer] Alright in there, come on out. (radio transmissions) - It'll be bad for you if we have to come in there. (radio transmissions) Flashlight. - Get over there. - Spread 'em. - Girls, up here in the front. You're alongside here. (radio transmissions) Okay you first. Okay. (people chattering) Come over here. (despairing music) - What happened to you, Freddy? Oh, poor little fella. Oh dear Lord, why? I'll build you again, Freddy. But I need to know why the Lord let this happen? Why Lord, why? - I called your parents, Lou. They said they'd pay all the damages but they really can't get away right now. - Kevin! - [Officer] Wait til old man Harrison gets here. - If he can walk. (subdued music) - [David Voiceover] Oh Father, children did this. Children? (wrathful music) (subdued music) Help me not to be angry. Help me understand. (wrathful music) (subdued music) And the Lord's servant must not quarrel. Instead, he must be kind to everyone. Able to teach, not resentful. (wrathful music) (subdued music) Those who oppose him, he must gently instruct, leading them to the truth. - We need you at the station to make the complaint. - Yeah. - [David Voiceover] Those who oppose him, he must gently instruct. - What have you done now? - What's this all about? Where's my kid? (dramatic music) - Oh! - What have you done now? - [Officer] Destruction of valuable property. - You halfwit, if you get caught you deserve what you get. - Let go of me! - [Woman] Mr. Wiemer, can't we talk about this? - How do you talk to a guy that still plays with dolls? - Tina was led into this with these boys. You can't intend to blame her. - Well, Lou's parents will pay for any damages. - Bill's stupid but he's not mean. - You wouldn't wanna blame children for a joke. - Now just hold it. Now, they're old enough to know what they were doing and smart enough to know they have to pay for the damages. Excuse me, please. - Who would've thought he would be so mean? - I'll see my attorney about this. - [Todd's Dad] I'll break Wiemer's dumb dolls. - I think you've gone mad. - Well, let me try judge. - It's your funeral. Go get them Sam. I hope you know what you're doing. - If thine enemy hunger, feed him. - Yeah (chuckles) if he doesn't eat you first. You each plead guilty? - [Altogether] Yes, sir. - The damage is appraised at $5,000 by the insurance company. I have a choice of penalties. A sentence in a training home or to have the parents pay up to three times the value of the property destroyed. What has been lost to the town by this group is impossible to calculate. However, Mr. Wiemer has prevailed upon me, as well as your attorney and the probation officer, to exact a penalty, which in his opinion, fits the crime. Therefore, I am going to place all five of you on probation to Mr. Wiemer for a period of two months. At the end of which, you will present a puppet show for the town in hopes of gaining some revenue for the community center which was lost to them by you. Do not mistake this for leniency. If, for any reason, you fail to show up at Mr. Wiemer's studio five days a week, six hours a day, or fail to present that performance, I will have each one of you hauled back in here and exact the severest penalty I can. Do you understand? - [Altogether] Yes, sir. - If you try any excuse to get out of your six hours with Mr. Wiemer, back you come. Do you understand? - [Altogether] Yes, sir. - You begin tomorrow at nine o'clock. (lighthearted music) - Come and sit down please. (mimicking fart noises) As the judge said, you'll do a show at the end of the summer. You'll write your own play from this book. (anxious music) - But this isn't a book? - The Bible. - You'll pick one of the stories from this book for your play. - But this is church stuff. - They'll laugh us out of town. - We'll work on it so they don't laugh. - [Todd] We? - Yeah, I'll be working with you. - Oh, aren't we lucky? - Yes, you are lucky Todd, you're very lucky. You could be on your way to training school instead of sitting here. (moves into menacing music) That's good, Todd. That's real good. You sure know how to push buttons on people to make 'em angry. Well, this summer we're gonna find out if you're capable of doing anything else. - Oh, I think so. - Todd. Sit down. (moves into fretful music) Now, each of you will bring in a story idea tomorrow morning for the play. - And if we don't? - Report to the judge. You have a choice. That's all for today. (moves into menacing music) I said, you can go. - I saved this for you to do Saul again. - Thanks Alice. - Alice, come on! - [Tina] Crazy. - You have a choice! (chuckling) I like bleeding hearts, they always feel sorry for poor delinquents like us, huh? (laughs) - [Kevin] Let's just get out of here! - [Lou] Yeah! (laughs) (brooding music) Be not overcomed of evil, but overcome evil with good. I dunno if I can do it. (sighs) (arguing) - Hey Todd, I got this good one about this guy Solomon, that he was gonna cut this baby in half. - Whoa, whoa! (whistles) Whoa. I got the story we're gonna do, okay? It's called The Lost Son. Now listen, this kid, he decides to take his father for everything he's worth and the old man let's him do it. And then when the kid spends all the money well the father's dumb enough to take him back. - [Kevin] The Prodigal Son. - What? - Here, in Luke chapter 15 verse 11. - You know this book, don't you Kevin? - So? - You like this stuff, Kevin? - No! - Well, good. 'Cause I got plans to shaft dear old David with the dear old dad part. (laughs) - Alright. - [Bill] Okay. - Now let's decide on what parts we're gonna play. - You have decided on your parts? - I am the older brother that get shafty. - I am the beautiful temptress. - I'm the clever tempter, not beautiful. - Todd? - I'm the, uh, Prodigal Son. - [David] Kevin? - Uh, he's the son's best friend. They do their thing with sheep together. - Sheep herding. - [Todd] That's it. - How about you Alice? - Could I be a sheep? - Hmm, you can be a whole herd of sheep. - A whole herd? - Yep. Now, it's about our puppets. (playful music) The ones we will use are called the hand or glove puppet. We'll make our own from scratch. Take the easy ideas first and you can practice on 'em til you get the hang of it. And when you feel comfortable, we'll begin the show puppets. - Ah! - [Tina] Oh no! (laughs) - That's enough of that! Clean up this mess. (laughs) - [David Voiceover] They're impossible. (sad music) Lord, are you sure you picked the right man for this job? (laughs) - I want you to work on a puppet stage to get the feel of it. Now, I've put some old puppets on a table in the back. Choose your puppets and make up a play to use them in. Alright, go on. Come on, come on. - Mr. Wiemer? - Hmm? Mrs. Hunter. - I wanna thank you for being so kind about what happened. - Well, let's hope it works. (uncertain music) - Something needs to work for Kevin, Mr. Wiemer. - Um, David. - David. (chuckles) Since his father died two years ago, he hasn't been the same person. - He loved his father very much? - Very much. And he, it was a long, painful... - Yeah, I see. Well uh, we'll try Mrs. Hunter, we'll try. - Julie. - (chuckles) Julie. - We? - Yes uh, the Lord, puppets, and me. (moves into lighthearted music) - I'll pray for you, David. - Oh, thank you, Julie. - (chuckles) Thank you. Uh, I have to go to work now. Goodbye. - Um, we could talk again. Sometime? - Yes. Goodbye. - Bye. (sighs) (moves into despairing music) Hmm? Hmm? (yells) (sighs) Alright, curtain. (mimicking sirens) (roars) - Oh dry up, you big green Lizard. (all yelling) (ominous music) - [Lou] Look out! (laughs loudly) I said "look out". (laughs) This is a rock. That's a tree. Most puppeteers like to work out action as actors before getting their puppets. Now we've uh, we've worked this little play out on paper. Let's see how it goes for real. Lou? - Uh, the first scene is the son and the friend with the sheep. Tina and I will come on later to sabotage. - How can I be a whole herd of sheep? - Um, everybody that's not in the scene will be a sheep. - Uh, that leaves uh, Bill, and you. (chuckles) (whistles) Boy, am I sick of sheep. (all mimicking sheep) I'd sell them all if I could buy something that was fun. - [David, Alice, Bill] Baa! - They're so dumb and stupid looking. - [David, Alice, Bill] Baa, baa! - And they're all so loud. - [David, Alice, Bill] Baa, baa. - It's my sheep herder friend. - We're off to the city for some fun. - Why don't you come along? - Well, maybe I will, huh? - Uh, what's about these sheep here? - [David, Alice, Bill] Baa! - You watch 'em. I'm gonna go get some money from dad and have some fun for a change. - Well, what am I gonna do with all these sheep? - [David, Alice, Bill] Baa! (playful music) - Kevin and Alice forgot their lunches. - [Altogether] Baa! (all laughing) (moves into pitiful music) - You must be crazy to do this kind of work all day long. - Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your hands. That's First Thessalonians chapter four, verse 11. - [Lou] I'd rather work with my head, it works faster. - My dad says working with my hands is all I'm good for. - He hasn't see your puppets. (laughs) - I like working with my hands, anyhow. - Well, they are faster than your brain. (laughs) - Hey! You were thankful for Bill's hands last winter when you fell through the ice and he pulled you out. - Yeah, I was Bill. - Alright. - There. Who could resist her? - [Lou] How can she see? - She was his radar. Boop-teety, boop-teety, boop! - She uses too much cut just like Tina. - I don't have to take that. It's four now, can we go? - Yeah just uh, just leave your puppets where they are. - Move it, Bill. - I'm gonna stay and finish this. - Huh? - You heard what I said. - Okay, okay. - [Tina] See ya tomorrow, Todd. - Yeah, see ya Tina. See ya Bill. - Yeah. (sighs) Mind if I stay? - It's your time. - Well, no one else wants it, and I'm behind everyone else. (hopeful music) - [David Voiceover] So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. - Did you read the book I gave you? - Oh, the Bible? Well, how do you think we got the story for the play? - I was uh, just wondering if you had any questions. - Are you gonna try to convert us all? - Yes. - Oh well, go ahead. I don't have anything else to do. (lighthearted music) - You could a lot worse and read the Bible. - (chuckles) I like comic books better. - Comic bookS? - Get out Fluff Head, you're getting nowhere. You've gotta sneak up on him. - The Bible does not sneak. - That's not what I said. Out, out, out! He means well but he made a hash of it. Now uh... - [Fluff Head] He'll never get born again if he doesn't get his feet wet. - Umm, how do I start? - [Fluff Head] Just jump in with something from the Bible. - Like what? - "Except a man be born again, "he cannot see the Kingdom of God", John 3:3. - So um, what do you mean, "born again"? - Jesus said, in the Bible, that you had to be born again in the spirit before you can be a child of God and eventually go home to our Father in Heaven. - [Orange Puppet] That's right, that's right. You're lucky to be a human and get to be saved. We're just fur and feathers. - Shush. Just tell God that you're sorry for your sins and that you'll make up to others if you've hurt them. - Then accept Jesus Christ as your savior and claim the promise He made you. - Then what? - [Brown Puppet] Then you are reborn as a child of God with all your sins forgiven. - But uh, why God do this? I'm nobody. - Oh, we forgot something important. God's love. - Oh yeah, God loves you dummy. That's why He does it. - He's not a dummy, you are. God lets you be saved for eternity because He made you and He loves you and you belong to Him. - You're not nobody, God loves you. That makes you somebody. - How do I know, um you, uh how do I, um... - You have to tell Him you wanna be His kid. He won't force you. - You have to accept it all by yourself, like you read in the Bible. - Where in the Bible? - It's all in here, Bill. - We gotta get our feet wet, huh? (David chuckles) - Come on in, Bill! Haven't you had enough of that book? - I get it! (Lou chokes) That's what he meant. - Bill? (perplexed music) - If you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord", and believe in your heart, that God raised he from the dead, you will be saved. (breathes heavy) - Help. He left the sheep alone again. - He left 'em with a friend. - He should be punished. - That's not for you to decide, my son. - I don't see much of Bill lately. - [Bill] But I've been doing all of his work. - I think David got to him. - Is he waiting now? - We'll see. - [Bill] I'll let him tell his own story then. - Hi dad, I'd uh like to ask a little favor. - [David] I'm listening son. - This should be fun. - I'd like you to give me my part of the farm and all the money I get when you die so I can split and do my own thing. - Where will you go? - To the city, with some friends who know how to have a good time. - I see. - I doubt it. Just give me the money and I'll never bother you again. - I love you, son. You're no bother. - Cut it, dad, nobody believes in that junk anymore. - Junk? - About loving. You want cheap labor for your farm, using people? That's what loving is all about. - You can have the money, my son. But remember, fathers do love their sons. I will always love my sons, wherever you are, where-- - Sure, sure dad, now where's the money? - They always give money easy. - That's all the son asked for. - That's all he gets. - [Todd] Thanks dad, I won't be back. - My son. (menacing music) - Hey! - Well, I guess that wraps it up for today. Let's uh, let's pack up. - Hey are you okay? - Why wouldn't I be? - Okay. Come on. - Hey everyone, how 'bout a swimming party? - I can't, mom says you're all a bad influence on me and I can't go anywhere with you. - [Lou] (chuckles) alright. - If I got away with half of what you got away with-- - Well I'm a girl! - We couldn't miss that if we tried. - What does that mean, shorty? - Pull in your claws, Tina, if you can find 'em under all that paint you wear. - You never complained before, midget. - I wasn't around you so much. - [Todd] Hey cut it out you two! - What's the matter with me lately? - You don't have to be tougher than the rest of us. Ease up. - I thought that's what you wanted. - [Bill] No. - Oh, look what you made me do to my make-up. - Don't wear it then. It makes you look like a panda bear anyway. (brass horn toots) (flute music) I must've said something wrong. - The way this day is going, I should've stayed in bed. Tina. - She brawled at me one after you left. - Everything is sure getting weird around here. - What do you mean "weird"? - Puppets all day, Tina's mad all the time, and Bill hanging around that do-gooder all day. - He's helped me a lot. - You fell for his line. - Not his line. - Hey Todd helped you a lot once, too. - [Bill] I'm a better friend for Todd now. - Huh? - I became a Christian last week and I-- - You what? (bewildered music) - [Bill] I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior. - Big dumb idiot. - Take it easy, Kevin. - [Kevin] You betrayed your friends. - No! David says-- - "David says, David says", you really let him get to you, didn't ya? - Hold it Kevin. - [Kevin] Traitor! - Kevin! - Come on Alice. Traitor! - Well it's not like your murdered somebody or something. What got into him? - I don't know. - Well, it's okay. I'm not prejudiced against Christians. You can swim in my pool. - (chuckles) Let's go. So I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior and I feel 100% better about myself. (graceful music) Hey, I gotta get going. My mom will have a fit and I'll be in trouble. Again. (chuckles) You know, Lou, about the group, I've been thinking, the reason why we got together was because we were lonely. - So uh, what? - When you accept Jesus Christ as your savior, you won't be lonely anymore. Hey, I gotta run. - [Lou Voiceover] Never will I leave you. Never will I forsake you. You mean, you were there all those lonely years and I never knew it? (phone rings) - David. I need your help. (hopeful music) - [Lou Voiceover] Pray this with your heart that you believe and are testified and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. (birds chirping) - I believe you are the Son of God. Come into my heart, Jesus. (joyous music) Alright! - Who is it? - Me. Lou. - What do you want at this time of night? - I wanted to say I'm sorry for this afternoon. - Couldn't it wait for the morning? - [Lou] No. - [Tina] You were really mean. - I'm sorry. - Am I really that bad? - Tina, you're a pretty girl, and you don't need all that make-up or that play-acting you do. Okay? - Okay. (happy music) (chuckles) Bill! - I'm sorry, too, Tina. - What is this, a convention? - Just us two. We like you Tina. - [Bill] Just as you are. And if you wanna wear all that junk on your face, go ahead. We'll like you anyway. - Oh! - (sighs) I think I said the wrong thing again. (playful music) - Move it over to the left, try to line it up with those hinges. - Sorry I'm a little late. - Hey Tina, you're pretty! - [Todd] Ow, look out. Look out! Look out, my shirt! - Look what you did to Todd's shirt. (eerie music) - I'll get my own shirt! - Let's get this stage up, come on. - Slow up, would ya? Would you stop? (sad music) - [Todd] You know what this bridge is? - Nope. - Separates the good part of town from the bad part. Learned that when I was about four years old. Town throws all of its junk under the bridge. All that's junk people on the other side. - Not true. - What? - You're not junk. - (sighs) Let's go. Let's get outta here. (both laugh) - [Bill's Puppet] Good riddance, brother. - Same to you, brother. - Our father is lucky to get rid of you. - So are you, huh brother? - [Bill] You could say that again. - [Tina] Hi handsome. Are you coming, too? - Get away from me! (Tina laughs) - Finally, I'm getting out of this dump! - [Tina] You'll love it! You'll have a wonderful time. (Tina laughs) - As long as your money lasts. (mischevous laugh) - Boy this is really living! Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai-yay! - Is Todd okay? - Tina thinks she's perfect as she is. She wouldn't listen to us. - She's smart enough to know something's missing. Like that scripture we read the other day, about putting on a new self that is like God. - "And be renewed in the spirit of your mind "and that you put on the new man "which was created according to God "in righteousness and true holiness." Ephesians 4:23 and 24. - Okay, I get your point. But how do we get her to listen? - You've been knocking Tina for what you feel is wrong, but in here it says that we should only say what is necessary for building others up according to their needs. - I don't see how you could say that about Tina. She gets everything she wants. - She needs to know that God loves her and wants her in His family and that she had a savior who died for her. - [Lou] Where do we start? - [Bill] I still don't think she's gonna listen. - [David] Well-- (Lou yells) I think we just made her start! (brooding music) (cries) - I'm guilty! I took the key and gave it to Todd. - Tina, anyone can fall into the wrong crowd. - I'm trying to tell you that I'm sorry for what I did. I don't wanna be like this anymore. - You know, that man and those kids are having a morbid effect on you. - Can't we just forget the whole thing? - Forget? That I hate myself? Lou and Bill want to help. You just want me to stay a little girl. I came down to tell you I was sorry. Like in the Bible. - Oh sure, baby. (chuckles) It's been a long day. - I need help! - You're just depressed. - I wanted to act like a Christian and you won't even listen. You never listen! You're making me act like I always do. Why can't you hear me? - It's hard to hear when someone's yelling at you. - [Tina] David? - This is a family matter. - I'm sorry but I couldn't help but overhear. - (gasps) All the neighbors, oh. - What have you been doing to our daughter? - He's been trying to help. David, I tried. (hopeful music) But it didn't work for me like Lou and Bill. - Who did you ask for help? - Them. - [David] That's not fair, Tina. - What? - "You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly." James 4:3. You can't ask your parents for something that belongs to God. Faith, the gift of grace, that's His to give through His son. That's who you ask for help. - I don't understand this. We've, we've always been Christians. - We go to church every Sunday. - Then you can help Tina become born again as a Christian. Right now. - But, but she is a Christian. - No! Not the way David, and Lou, and Bill are. - We believe in God and... We try to lead good lives. - We even read the Bible sometimes. - Did you read the part about having to be born of the spirit to enter the Kingdom of Heaven? - Well, that sounds familiar. - I'll bet. - Oh, oh. Sure, I, I remember it. - Well you see, Tina hasn't had that experience yet. But she has started on the first steps. - I have? - Weren't you trying to confess your sins, and ask forgiveness? - Yes. - So that's what you were doing? - I really messed it up. - Who should you ask forgiveness of first? - Ask God first and he'll help me with everyone else. - Well I, I think we can take it from here. Thanks for your help, Mr. Wiemer. - No David, don't go. Until I get through it. - You stay Mr. Wiemer. Tina needs you. - Uh, mother? - Shh. Please dear, let him finish. - Well, perhaps your uh, your father would like to take it from here, about what a Christian believes. - Well we, believe, in the one God and, and that His Son died for our sins and uh, He rose again from the dead. Well, I um... I don't, what else is there? - Commitment. You have to ask. - You mean, I just ask? And he gives it to me, this faith, or grace or whatever? - The Lord wants you Tina. He doesn't intend to make it hard to come to Him. You just ask and you shall receive. - I dunno how to start. You mean pray, don't you? - Well maybe uh, maybe your dad would like to start the prayer? To help you accept Jesus as your savior and to be in God's family. - Me? Well, sure. Father, Father I... I'm a little bit out of practice. (graceful music) Father we need you to help our daughter accept Jesus as her savior. I guess I've kind of taken you for granted these last days and, we, we need your help. Help us. - Help me be part of your family. I believe Jesus is my savior and I want to be in your family and do what you want me to do all the rest of my life. - And I want to be in your family with Tina. Your Son died for my sins so that You could forgive me. Forgive my blindness. Thank you for the gift of eternal life. - Now we're all Christians. Together. - Together! You two sit down and we'll be right back. - You know, I guess I need to start where Tina did. I owe you an apology Mr. Wiemer. - Not really. - Well I said I was a Christian. But I lied. It wasn't until just now. I need your forgiveness. - I dunno for what. - I guess I wanted to blame you for things that were wrong in my family. Well, we owe you a lot. - In that case, you can pay me back right now. - (chuckles) What? - I need your advice. You see, when you don't have any kids of your own, you don't always understand. - Well, sure. (chuckles) Anything I could help you with. (Tina laughs) - My first glass of lemonade. (laughs) With real lemons. - Oh. - Welcome. (lighthearted music) If you're all finished, I thought you might need some refreshments. - Alright! Yeah! - Homemade cake. Wow! - With that kind of appreciation, you may have two pieces. - Wait til I put this stuff away. (menacing music) - If you'd get your mind off of food once in a while. - They're all dead. - No they're not dead Alice, they, they just need to be fixed. I'm sorry honey, but we'll fix 'em up good as new okay? - We'll all fix 'em tonight. Right David? - Right, we'll meet after supper. That okay for everyone? - Yeah, with all of us working, we'll have it done before the show tomorrow. (ominous music) - I gotta go dad. Let me go! - You ain't spending any extra time with that doll maker. You just stick here. - Dad! (moves into dramatic music) Ah! - [Tina's Dad] I never realized there were so many sheep in The Prodigal Son. - A sheep herder has to have a herd, dad. - I'm glad the kids chose The Prodigal Son for their play. It's a story of great love. - [Kevin] That's not why we chose it. - [Julie] Kevin! - We chose it because we thought it'd give David the hardest time with it. - [Lou] Hey Kevin! - Not because we believe the great love that fathers have for their sons. Look at Lou's dad, he's never around. Or Bill's dad who tells him he's an idiot all the time. Or Tina's dad who doesn't let her grow up. Then there's Todd's dad who beats him just because Todd's there. Yeah, fathers are real big in this group. - You forgot to mention your dad, Kevin. - I, I don't have a dad. - Huh? I can't hear you. - He's dead, you know that! (suspenseful music) - Well what are you so angry about? - I'm not, I'm not. - You sure sound angry. - I think I'd be sad if my dad died but-- - Just shut up! What do you know about it? You're not alone. - Kevin, your father didn't leave you alone. He loved you. All of us. He didn't have a choice, the Lord called him and-- - He should've asked God to take someone else. God had no right to take him. You always take about God like He cares. He doesn't care, you don't kill people you care about. You didn't see my dad die. It was long and hard, he suffered all the time. Don't! - I love you even if you don't love me. (hopeful music) - [Kevin] Cut it out Alice. - We all love you, Kevin. Even if you don't love us. - Just like Jesus loved us. - No matter how we sin, He died for us in pain and suffering, to save us Kevin. - Kevin, your father died, but he wasn't worried about you, because he knew you had given yourself to Jesus and the Lord would take care of you. - [David] He didn't leave you alone. - He didn't? - You became a Christian when you were seven. - I believed that until... - Until your father died. - [Kevin] Yeah. - Your dad believed in you. And he didn't think you were gonna act like a little kid and get angry with God. - He thought you would ask your Father in Heaven for help. - Jesus loves you even if you don't love Him. - But where was He? Why didn't He... - Did you ask? (ominous music) - [Bill] Happy, Alice? - You made a good sheep, Bill. - All of our lost sheep are back again. - Not all. - Todd? - [Kevin] He's the loneliest of 'em all. - [Kevin Voiceover Echoing] He's the loneliest of 'em all. - After the show tomorrow, the probation period is over. (all cheers) - [Altogether] Alright! (laughs) - If these kids are gonna perform tomorrow, we better get them home. Kevin? - [Kevin] I'm coming. - [Lou] Alright. - [Tina's Dad] Goodnight. - [Lou] Bye. - [Tina] See ya guys. - [Julie] It went great. - [Tina's Dad] Yeah. - [Tina] I think we got a lot done, too. - [Tina's Dad] I thought some of us did, Lou did he get all of his? - I haven't taken a walk in months. I never seem to have the time. - I walk a lot. I seem to have more time than I need. (clattering) - You don't have any kids to worry about. (slow jazz music) - No. No, I don't. (ominous music) I had a son. (slow jazz music) My wife and boy were driving home one night on the rain-slick highway when the Lord decided to take them from me. (ominous music) - I'm sorry. (slow jazz music) - It was a long time ago. - Uh, I gotta go back to the studio for a minute. Go on, I'll catch up. - [Julie] Okay. (eerie music) - Todd? Todd? Oh no, Todd! (dramatic music) No, Todd. Don't! It won't do you any good. It'll only hurt you a lot. - I trusted you! - We all care about you, we're just trying to help. - You're like the rest, you went over. (grunts) (moves into suspenseful music) - I went back to God. I was gonna tell you all about it. - You were my friend. (grunts) - You don't understand. - Hey, I understand. You don't understand. (grunts) - Poor old Todd. - Are you nuts? You're the one that's bleeding, not me. - You're bleeding inside. Without Jesus, it'll kill you. (Todd yells) - It's my fault. - Cut it out! - I knew about God loving you but I never told you. - Don't start that stuff. I don't believe in your Jesus. - Todd? - What? - I can't find the bag. - Tough. - You're trying to hurt all of us, but everyone's praying for you right now. We all wanted you to be part of God's family. With us. We'd be a group again. Brothers for real. I can't find the bag. (hopeful music) - Go do your dumb show. - Yours too. - Forget it. - Don't let us down, you're not a coward. - I should've left you down there. - God wants you. We want you. - No. - See you tomorrow? - No! - [Kevin Voiceover] God wants you. We want you. (foreboding music) God wants you. We want you. (grunts) (people chattering) (suspenseful music) - [David] Kevin, you're gonna have to play the part. - I prayed to the Lord last night that He'd help. The Lord will help. Todd will come. (people chattering) - Kevin, where is he? We've only got two minutes. - He'll come. - Sometimes the Lord has other plans. - No, He'll help. (moves into hopeful music) See? See? - I see. Get your puppets everyone. Come on, go. - You okay? - Are you okay? - As of right now, I am. - You are a real nut, you know that? - Come on, let's go. (audience claps) - Boy, am I sick of sheep. - [Herd Of Sheep] Baa, baa. - [Todd's Puppet] I'd sell them all if I could buy something that was fun. - [Herd Of Sheep] Maa, maa. - [Todd's Puppet] They're so dumb and stupid looking. (audience laughs) - [Herd Of Sheep] Haa, aaa! - And they're all so loud. - [Herd Of Sheep] Baa, baa. ♫ Hi ho ♫ We're so free ♫ Me and drink and money have we all ♫ See we are so merry - [Todd's Puppet] I'm hungry! - Let's get something to eat. - [Lou's Puppet] Give me the money and I'll go get us some cakes. - [Todd's Puppet] But I uh... (clears throat) Don't uh have anymore money. (chuckles) - [Lou's Puppet] Oh... Well. Too bad. Bye. - [Tina's Puppet] See ya around, kid. (laughs) ♫ Hi Ho ♫ He's a fool ♫ We took him for everything he had ♫ Now we'll find another (Lou and Tina laugh mischievously) - They made a fool outta me. All they wanted was my money and now I don't have anything and I'm hungry! - [Lou's Puppet] What do you want? - Food. - I don't feed beggars. Wait, how about a job? You can have all the food you want. Yeah. (laughs mischievously) (audience laughs) (mimicking pigs) (audience laughs) - Well wait a minute, wait a minute. One for you, one for you, one for you, and one for me. Oh, why didn't I know when I was well off? My father's animals eat better than you do. (mimicking pigs) I can't stand it anymore. I'm going back home. I'd be better as a servant on my father's farm than to be here. (mimicking pigs) (grunts) So long, friends! You won't have to share anymore! (mimicking pigs) (audience claps) (mimicking sheep) - Uh, sorry! Why, why it's you. I'm so glad to see you. - Don't... I'll get you all dirty. - Nevermind that, have you seen your father yet? - No I-- - [Kevin] But you must see your father first. - I just came to look for a job. - But see your father first. (micking sheep) - I can't play this scene. - Go on, Todd. - Who is that I see? In the distance. Who is it? - Go on. - [Todd] I... - He's forgotten his lines. - It is my son. (grieving music) - I... - My son. The Lord has blessed us again. You, young man. Bring his best clothes still in his room. Bring a ring for his hand and sandals for his feet. Have the fatted calf killed, for we are going to have a feast! In honor of the return of my beloved son. - [Kevin] I will gladly. - Don't leave my son. For we will talk and be happy. - [Bill] That's not my cue! - Make up something. - Um, I knew he'd be back. I bet he's run out of money and he just wants more. - [David's Puppet] It doesn't matter. - Yes it does! He took his share and he doesn't deserve anymore. - [Todd's Puppet] He's right. - If he you give him anymore it would just um, uh... What did you say? - I don't deserve anymore. I took my share and I threw it all away. - Yes you did, but, I... - You throw money away, but you cannot throw love away. You cannot make a father hate, because he loves you. - How? I'm dirty and I've done bad things. - But you are my son, and I love you. As the Father above loves us all. - You'd really forgive me? - Of course I will. - I, I've gotta go wash the sheep. - Baa, baa. - Will God forgive me? - He will forgive and rejoice like me, for His son was lost and is found, and you are His son and mine. (lighthearted music) Come, come join your family. We will be together again. And you will never again be lost. (audience claps) - What about the last scene? - Forget it, that was the last scene. (Bill chuckles) - I'm sorry. - Hey, one beating for the Lord's worth it. - I'm glad it wasn't me. - Hey, Todd's lucky it was Bill. (laughs) (people chattering) - Will you help? - We'll all help. Your hand okay? - Here they come. (lighthearted music) (people chattering) - You really did a good job. (chuckles) - Hi David. - Hi Julie. - Thank you. - [Tina's Dad] All the way around, good job. - You did it. - Thanks Judge. - Thank you. Oink, oink, oink. - You make me feel secluded. You'd have to sprinkle that money. - (chuckles) Thanks dad. - Nice job. - Thanks. (lighthearted music)
