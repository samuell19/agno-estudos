(pulsating bass-heavy music) (heavy breathing) - It’s fine. It’s fine, you’re fine. You’re fine. (water running) (panting) (suspenseful electronic music) - OK, what’s wrong? You probably said two words and you barely touched your food. - I had another nightmare last night. - Oh, Alex, why don’t you see somebody about this? It’s getting ridiculous and you look like hell. - I am seeing someone, Eric, that therapist. - Is it helping? - Some days yeah, some days no. - Well, I’d give it a little while longer and if something doesn’t change, drop ’em and find somebody else. (muffled voices) - Angela? - Alexandria? - [Alex] Hey. - Oh, hey. Do you mind? - [Alex] Oh, sorry, here. - Thanks. - Well, how have you been? - I’ve been good, how are you? - I’m good, I’ve been good. - Honestly perfect timing, you being here, thank you. Come on in. - Thanks. - Let me put this away real quick. Let me take that from you. Thank you so much. - You’re welcome. - [Angela] So, how have you been? I haven’t seen you in a while. - (sighs) I’ve been good. I was just over at Eric’s, actually. - Oh, how’s he doing? - He’s good, he’s good. - [Angela] That’s good. Oh, I’m sorry, can I get you something? - Oh, no, thank you. - Are you sure, it’s not a problem. - I’m fine, really. I should actually get going. - Really, are you sure? - But it was really great seeing you. - It was great seeing you. I hope to see you soon. - Of course. - All right, I’ll see you later then. - [Alex] Have a good day, OK? - You too. - [Alex] Bye. (suspenseful droning music) (knocking) (harsh screeching music) - Interesting. This one’s different this time. So, what do you think it means? - Aren’t I paying you to tell me that? OK, I don’t know. I don’t know what it means but it means I’m not getting any sleep. That’s what it means. - You’re avoiding again. - I’m not avoiding! I honestly don’t know! But I do know this, I’m getting sick of it! - Well, we’re about out of time. Have you given any more thought to taking the medication? - No, and I’m not going to. I can get through this without the pills. - Fair enough. I’ll see you next week. (beep) (suspenseful ringing music) (gasps) (dog barking) (knocking) - Alexandra Myers? - Yes, that’s me. - Detective Warren and Stuart, can we come in? - What’s this about, officer? - It’s detective, and we could discuss it out here in front of your neighbors or... - No, no, please, come in. - Nice place. Anyone else home? - No, sir. - We’re from homicide. I’m Detective Warren, that’s Detective Stuart. We’re investigating the murder of Angela Withers, which occurred this morning. We understand that you were there. - Oh, my God, yeah. Yeah, I was there. I was visiting my friend, Eric. He lives in the building right in front of hers. - Yeah, we’ve already spoken to him. - Did she seem distraught this morning to you? - No, in fact, she seemed happy. Maybe a little stressed out but... - Did you notice anyone suspicious while you were there? - No. - Are you married? - No, just a boyfriend. - You two getting along? - Yes, of course, why? - What did you and Angela talk about? - Nothing really. She was carrying groceries, trying to get into her apartment and I helped her, and that was it. - Nothing else happened? - No. Look, she and I were friends but we weren’t close. I mean we were acquaintances more than anything else. - Where’s your boyfriend? - Still at work, I guess. - Did your friend, Eric ever date Angela? - No, not that I know of. - What about you? - No. - Well, that’ll be all for now, Ms. Myers, but we might have some more questions so I wouldn’t stray too far, OK? - Yes, of course. Sure. Bye. (creepy droning music) (gasps) - Oh, honey, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to startle you. Baby, come here. (heavy breathing) It’s OK. I’m so sorry I scared you. Sorry. Are you OK? - I’m fine. - [Man] Are you sure you’re OK? - I’m fine, baby. - [Man] Dinner will be ready in a few. I see you’ve been cleaning again. You didn’t have another nightmare, did you? - A small one. - [Man] How did your session go today? - What day is it? - [Man] The sixth, why? (sighs) Dinner’s ready. - Hmm. (mumbled t.v. voice) Are you... Are you staying here tonight? - Yeah, I think I will. - OK, baby. Babe. - Hmm? - [Alex] Have you ever been out in public and felt like... I don’t know, like someone was watching you? - Yeah, I guess, maybe, why? - [Alex] Because I felt like that today. - What happened? - Nothing. I was at the bookstore and I felt like this guy was staring at me and then when I went to leave I felt like he was following me and then he was gone. - Hmm, that’s weird. I’m sure it was just your imagination. He was probably just looking in your direction is all. - Yeah, maybe you’re right. - Was this after or before you heard about Angela? - Before. - I’m sure it was nothing. - Yeah. You’re right, babe. - Goodnight, baby. - Love you. - Love you too. (ticking) (glass breaking) (gasps) (suspenseful droning music) (intensifying creepy music) (sighs) (knocking) - Yeah, babe, I’ll be out in a minute. (knocking) Alexandra, I’ll be out in a minute. (knock) Fine. You want to come in, come in. (harsh screeching music) Whoa, no, no, no! (screams) (spurting) (creepy ringing music) (screams) - Jason! - Alexandra. (gasps) (heavy breathing) Alexandra, you’re gonna be late. We overslept again. I made you some toast. I’ll see you tonight. Oh, and I got you a gift. It’s on the bathroom counter. (panting) (sighs) (sighs) (siren) - Morning. - Morning, Mary. - How you doin’ today? - Amazing. How are you? - Good. - [Eric] Hey, Mary. - Hey, Eric. (phone ringing) - There you are. You’re late. A little early morning rendezvous? - Hardly. But he did get me something nice. - Oh, yeah? What did he get you, a diamond? - Nu-uh. - Two tickets to the game tonight? - No. - I got it, the ski trip. He’s letting you go, am I right? - A calendar. - A calendar, what? - He really loves me. - A calendar. Is it electronic or something? - No. - Oh, yeah, he really adores you. Drinks tonight? - Sure. - Sweet. A plain paper calendar, huh? - Yep. - Now you see, this is why I’m not married. I don’t get that. (upbeat blues-rock music) - Hey, do you want to go shoot some pool? - Sure. - Bye. - Another round? - Yes, please. And keep ’em coming. - All right, comin’ right up. [Alex] Thank you. - So, everything’s good at home, I see. - Yes, yes. - That’s good, that’s great. I’m happy for you. - Thank you. - (sighs) Listen, I wanted to say something at work earlier about Angela. - Yeah, I couldn’t believe that either and I’d just seen her that day too. It’s crazy. - Yeah. I hope they catch the son-of-a-bitch, that’s all I can say. - Yeah, me too. - So, is Jason gonna let you go on this ski trip, or what? - I haven’t even asked him. - Why not? - I’ve just been too busy. - Too... busy? - Yes, busy. - Alex, what could possibly be more important than a beautiful ski resort weekend, plenty of booze, one night relationships, and plenty of booze? - I’m probably gonna have to ask him to go with me. - Ah, geez, Alex, you’re killing me. This is supposed to be a co-workers weekend. - It’s the only way he’s gonna let me go, Eric. - I liked you better when you weren’t this whipped. - Here you go. If you need anything else just let me know. - Yeah, please, one backbone for the lady. - Actually, yeah. Do you know that guy at the bar? - Which one? - The one in the trench coat. Isn’t it a little hot to be wearing a trench coat? - Yeah, but you know, we get these kinds all the time. Sorry, I don’t know him. - [Eric] What’s the matter, you know him? - No, but he keeps staring at me. - What? He’s probably just waiting on a pool table. - Eric, the tables are over there and I’m over here. Come on. - Well, maybe he’s checking you out, you know. You are kinda cute, in that best friend/sister kind of way. - Eric. - Don’t flatter yourself, you’re not my type. - You don’t understand, I saw this guy at the bookstore the other day too and he was staring at me then. - Come on. - I’m being serious. - Let’s just go over there and see what he wants then. - What, Eric, no. - [Eric] Where the hell did he go? - He’s gone. - No shit, he was just standing right there. - Eric, he disappeared. - Probably some whack-job, don’t worry about it. That’s awesome. - Thanks for asking me out. - Go get some sleep. Take care. - Bye, Eric. - [Eric] Bye. (voices in unison saying "Alexandra") - I’m telling you I’m freaking out. - Well, what about the medication? Have you considered taking it? - I started it two days ago and I don’t think it’s helping. - Well, I’m sure it is. Let’s cut back on the dosage. Let’s try that for a few days, all right? - All right. (suspenseful droning music) - Hey, you. Mr. Russell says he needs that report on his desk by 5:00 today. Did you happen the finish that? - I left it in the copy room. Can you go get it? - Why do I have to go get it? It’s your report. - Can you just go get it?! - All right, geez. (clicking) (phone ringing) - Very good, Alexandra. That’s very good indeed. However, I’m concerned about you. You just haven’t seemed like yourself lately. Is everything all right at home? - Yes, sir, everything’s fine. - And Jason, he’s OK? - Yes, sir. - Well, you know, if you ever need someone to talk to, my door is always open. - Yes, sir, thank you. - I was thinking that maybe you’d like to take a few days off. You know, just to rest. Hang around the house for a few days. - No, thank you, sir. That won’t be necessary. I’m fine, really. - Well, if you change your mind... - I’ll let you know, sir. Thank you. (suspenseful ringing music) - [Alex] Hey! Hey, you! Hey, stop! (yelling in foreign language) - What the hell’s going on with you?! What the hell are you doing?! Get the hell out of here! What are you guys doing?! Get the hell... You want some trouble?! Huh? You want some trouble?! - [Voiceover] You’re crazy, man. (yelling in foreign language) - You might need some help. (thud) - Excuse me, can I help you? - [Alex] Call the police, there’s a man chasing me! - [Woman] What? - Do you have a back door?! - [Woman] Yeah. (screeching tires) (beeping) - I’m telling you, she is crazy. She is nuts. - OK, calm down. - I’m calm. - Just tell me what happened. - She came running in the store and knocked everything over. Then she went out the back door. I followed her out the back. That’s it. (mumbling) I don’t know, I didn’t see it. - OK, let’s just go over this one more time. Tell me what happened. - Why do you keep asking me that? I already told you. I’ve never seen him before. I don’t know who he is but he was holding a knife. - OK, and you said that he had dark hair? - Yes. No, I don’t... Look, he was trying to kill me. - OK, calm down. - Look, I know it sounds crazy but it’s not! - OK, look, we’re gonna look into this but I’m gonna need you to come down to the station to fill out some paperwork form me, OK? - Fine, let me just call my boyfriend. (slam) (sighs) (laughs) - What do you think? - Oh, she’s certifiable, man. There’s no doubt about it. - Yeah, but the saleslady said a man did come in the store right behind her and it seemed he was the one she was running from. - Oh, yeah, you mean the same saleslady down there screaming that she’s nuts? And she also said she really couldn’t be sure about that other guy. (laughs) I mean, look, man, this chick is probably hittin’ the bottle. She’s having problems with her old man at home she’s not telling us about. Come on, we see this shit 20 times a day. Besides, she is suspect number one in that Angela Withers case. - OK, yeah. You’re right. But I don’t know. Something about her, just seems too convincing. - Yeah, don’t they all though? - Yeah. - [Alex] Why is this happening to me? Why? - [Eric] What did the cops say? - They made me file a report. The usual fucking bullshit! I don’t think they believe me! - Hey, you gotta calm down, OK? - I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do! Tell me what to do! - Alex, relax. OK? And you’re gonna have to tell Jason. - Are you crazy? He’ll freak out, I can’t tell him. He’ll panic and want to leave the country or something. No, no! - He’s your future husband. He has to know. - You’re not hearing me. He’ll lose it. He’ll tell me to cut back the dosage or something, no. - All right, all right, all right. Have a seat, please. We’ll work this thing out together, OK? Here. - Hit me again. - My God. - Keep ’em coming. (sniff) Alright, I need to lay low for a while. That’s it, right? That’s all I need to do is just lay low. - What about work? - Damn it! (crying) I’m gonna order us some food. What do you want? - Nothing, just more alcohol. Yeah, OK, I’m gonna order us some food. - I don’t understand. Why did you tell the officer you needed to call Jason when you didn’t? - I guess I just second guessed it before I did. - Mmm-hmm, I see. - See what, doctor? There’s nothing to see. - Well, let’s explore that. Why do you think you didn’t tell him? - Because I know him. Because he’s a man and he’ll freak out. Hell, I’m freaking out, doctor. - OK, OK, calm down. - I just don’t understand why this is happening to me. Why me, I’m a good person? I pay my taxes, I give to charity. Why me? - There is no reason for you to believe this man is after you. It could just be an isolated incident. - Doctor, I’ve seen this man more than once, OK? He’s stalking me. - Really? Let’s look at it. You saw him in the bookstore, right? - Right. - And you saw him at the bar. - Yes. - This could all just be a coincidence. - Then how do you explain him almost attacking me, doctor?! - OK, OK. Now, clearly there’s some things we need to work out here but I want you to stay on your meds and I want you to come back and see me next week. Alexandra, OK? - OK, doctor. - [Doctor] OK. (sighs) - You know, comedians are gonna want to copyright this shit. - Yeah, I know. Definitely. - You guys are holding out on me now. - OK, so it’s about this bloom end. It was just really good. - [Server] Hello. - Hi. - [Server] My name is Tess and I’ll be your waitress this evening. - Hi, Tess. - [Tess] Here you go. - Thank you. - Miss, can I have another glass, this one’s dirty? - [Tess] Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll get you another one right away. - Thank you. - [Woman] I don’t know... chopstick. - They have some great food. - [Tess] OK, there we go. - Miss? You didn’t get that. - I’ll be right back. (laughing) - [Tess] There we are. OK, are you all ready to order? - I think so. - [Woman] Yeah, can I get the spaghetti? - [Tess] And what are you having? - Can you go to him? - [Tess] OK. - I’m gonna have the pasta. - Sure, OK. - Great night, Alex. Thanks. - [Alex] Don’t thank me, thank Jason. It was his idea. - Hey, I’ve been noticing you all evening and does it happen to you too? - What? - When people stare at you. (laughs) Don’t you just hate that? It’s like they want to follow you home or something. - Yeah. Yeah, I do. - Just freaks me out. (voices in unison saying "Alexandra") Good? - [Jason] So you caught the end of the game, right? That was a good game. - [Man] I kind of knew it would go that way. - Well, guys, thank you for the great evening but I have an early day tomorrow and so does Jason, I’m sure. - Uh, yeah. Oh, yeah, early day. (laughs) - [Woman] All right. Call me tomorrow? - OK. - [Woman] I’ll see you later, bye. - [Jason] Nice to see you. - Bye. - [Jason] See you around. (nocturnal piano music) (suspenseful droning music) (phone ringing) (scream) - Oh, my God, Mary. You scared me! - Sorry. Mr. Russell needs this by 5:00. - OK, thank you. - Are you OK? - Yeah, I’m OK. I’m OK, thanks. I’ll bring it right to him. (sighs) Oh, my God. - And we are here. - Can you drop me off a little closer? - What, you’re scared? Your car is right there, Alex. - Are you serious? - What? (laughs) - Nothing, nothing. Thanks, Eric. - Cool. - I’ll see you tomorrow, OK? - [Eric] Yep. Hey, Alex? (laughs menacingly) So scary, huh? - [Alex] Asshole. (door creaks) (suspenseful droning music) (tires screeching) - Fucking bitch, you could have killed me! Son of a bitch. (click) (rattle) (suspenseful droning music) (clinking) - Whoa, Jesus! - [Alex] Jason. - Sorry, I just wanted some water. - You scared me. - What’s going on? - I thought I heard something but everything is fine. Come on, let’s go back to bed. - Wait, wait, wait. I’m thirsty. (sighs) - I think I’ll be all right, night stick girl. (sighs) (tapping) - Alexandra? - [Jason] Oh, man, this place is creepy. (blues-rock music) - Line ’em up. One more for the road. - Eric, the bar closed for you ten minutes ago. - Jo? You know me, I’m Eric. - Yeah, that’s why I closed it. Come on, go home. I’m calling you a cab. - I don’t need a babysitter, damn it. I need another beer. What the fuck is this? - (laughs) It’s a pick-me-up. - I don’t need a damn pick-me-up. - [Jo] I’ll have Skip make you a sandwich. (beeps) (rattle) (suspenseful droning music) ("Freakshow" by Marion Crane) ? Welcome to the freakshow? (moves into creepy ringing music) (groans) - Uh, I gotta stop that. (sighs) Yo! Chick’s got me spooked now. It’s fucking ridiculous. (suspenseful droning music) (whack) (groan) (spurting) - OK, we’re all done in here. You can come on in. - [Stuart] Thanks. - Look like somebody we know? Run that for prints. - I told you, "I was at home in bed." - Then how do you explain the picture frame he had with your fingerprints on it? - I don’t know, we’re friends. I’m over there all the time. (crying) Am I a suspect?! - We haven’t said that. We’re just trying to get an understanding of your relationship and where you were. - I don’t freaking believe this! My friend just died! Someone just killed my best friend! You’re over here questioning me! You’re accusing me! - Notice anything strange about him recently? Anyone mad at him? Might want to harm him for any reason? - No. - Notice any strange men following you around lately? How about that psychiatrist, are you still seeing him? - How’s that going for you? Ms. Myers, are you on any psychotropic drugs? - (crying) The only friend I’ve ever known is lying over there dead and you guys are messing with me. I’m not answering any more questions until I speak with my attorney! - OK, but I think by the time that this is all over, you’re gonna need a lot more than that. - What do you think? - I think you know what I think. - She’s guilty as hell, right? - I think they’re having an affair, he calls to break it off, she comes over, they get in a fight, but this time she’s on something. The drugs kick in and she just stabs the shit out of him. (phone ringing) - Great, me too. But how do we prove it? - (sighs) C.S.I. come back? - Nu-uh, you want to hold her? - On what? Let her go for now but I want to hear from C.S.I. tonight. - You got it. (phone ringing) - Alexandra, let’s try and work through this, OK? - (crying) I can’t believe it, I can’t believe he’s gone and I’m never gonna see him again. - I’m sorry. I really am. - And the worst part is those idiots think I killed him. They think I killed my best friend. - Are you officially a suspect? - I don’t know, they haven’t named me as one yet. - Have you contacted an attorney? - I had to, I had to, they were interrogating me! He said I haven’t been named as a suspect yet. - Well, that’s good news. Look, in these situations, it is typical for one to dwell upon past discretion but I don’t want you to do that, OK? We can talk through this. We can come up with a solution. Somehow make sense of it. - How do you make sense of this, Doc? How do you make sense of murder? How do you make sense of senseless killing?! - [Doctor] Well I... - Stop! Don’t say another word, OK? I’m leaving, I’m out of here and I’ll see you next week! - Alexandra. - You want to tell me something doctor? Tell me that I’m dreaming, doctor. Tell me that I’m gonna make up soon and all of this is gonna go away. - I wish I could, Alexandra. I wish I could. (suspenseful droning music) (crying) (crying) You understand I am underneath doctor-patient oath here and I really cannot divulge anything. - Yeah, yeah, look, doc, we’re not here to waste your time or ours. We just want to know how long she’s been seeing you and what for. - (sighs) Well, Ms. Myers has been coming to see me for about a year now. - And? - Yeah, Doc, just give it to us in layman’s terms. - Well, basically she suffers from a lot of things. A dream-like state where she’s asleep and thinks she’s awake and vice versa. Various neuroticism, such as forgetfulness, extreme cleanliness, and... - OK, OK, Doc, look, just tell us if she’s loons or what. - I don’t consider my patients "loons," detective. - OK, OK, of course you don’t. Did you know the deceased? - I did not. - Did Alexandra ever express any hostility towards him or about him to you? - As I mentioned, detective, I cannot tell you that. - Look, Doc, we can get a warrant down here faster than you can pop another Viagra and make you tell us. - I suggest you do that, officer. I want to tell you this: Alexandra is not a murderer. - Because you’re the expert on murderers, right? (clears throat) Oh, one more thing. Where were you the night and time the deceased was murdered? - I was at a dinner party with friends, whom I’m sure will collaborate that. - I’m sure. We’re gonna be in touch, Doc. You know, I hate these smug assholes. They think they can fix these people and they don’t have a first fucking clue. - C.S.I. came back empty. - I knew you were gonna say that. (clock ticking) (sighs) (phone ringing) - Alexandra? I just wanted to let you know that we’re all very sorry about Eric. He was a wonderful man. - Thank you. - If you need anything, just me know, OK? - OK. Thanks, Mary. (sentimental piano music) (beep) (beeping) (suspenseful droning music) Oh, my God, Mary. - Alexandra, are you OK? - I’m fine, are you OK? I’m so sorry. - [Mary] No, I’m fine. It’s OK, really. Are you looking for someone? Is Jason here? Alexandra? - Huh? Jason’s at home. - OK. - [Alex] Yeah. - Are you gonna be OK? - Yeah, I’ll be fine, Mary. I’ll see you tomorrow, OK? - OK. - Bye. - [Mary] See you tomorrow. (creepy droning music) Oh! You scared the hell out of me. - I’m sorry, you forgot your bag. - Oh, thank you. (tense jarring music) - Hey, babe. - [Alex] Hey, babe. So, I ran into Mary at the store today. - Oh, yeah, how’s she? - She’s good, she looks good. (suspenseful droning music) - [Warren] What do we got, guys? - Guys, it looks like a bloodbath over there. Actually, you’re probably gonna want a pair of these. (siren) - [Warren] All right, let’s see what we got. - I’d say she’s been dead about five hours. - Five hours? Cause of death? - Easy, knife. And I’d say a big one. - You’ll never guess where she works. - Where? - Same place as our friend, Alexandra Myers. - Could just be a coincidence. - No, I doubt it. Have a unit pick her up. - If you want it. - My God. - We have the witnesses that place you at the scene of the crime. - Yeah, I was there. I ran into her and we spoke. She was my friend. - Look, princess, we know you’re guilty so why don’t you save us a lot of time and confess? - I left before she did. I was home by 7:00 PM. You can ask my boyfriend. - For all I know, he’s in on it with you. - I told you assholes, I told you there was a killer on the loose and you didn’t believe me. This is your fault, detective! Yours, not mine! - You killed her, didn’t you? - [Alex] No. - You killed her just like you killed your own best friend, Eric. He pissed you off and you stabbed him to death in his own house. - (crying) You stupid piece of shit, people have to die around you bastards before you’ll do any real police work and even then, you’ll arrest the wrong people. You should be fired, detective, for not doing your fucking job! - You little bitch. Your skinny ass is mine. See these walls? You need to get used to ’em ’cause you’re not going anywhere for a very long time. (suspenseful droning music) Come on, she’s guilty as sin, I’m telling you. - [Stuart] I know, so let’s go prove it. - You needed a night out, you know. You’ve just been so stressed and everything like that. Ooh, hey, look at that. Come on, let’s go inside. - You go check it out, baby, I’ll wait out here. - Are you sure? - Yeah, go on. Check it out. - OK, I’ll only be a minute. (suspenseful droning music) (thud) - It doesn’t matter to me. If you think we should buy it then fine. - I don’t want to buy it if you don’t want to... (blood-curdling scream) - What the hell was that? - [Woman] Oh, my God. - Are you OK? (crying) Are you hurt? Do you need an ambulance? - I’ll call the police. - [Alex] No, no, don’t do that. It’s OK, I’m OK. - But he attacked you. - I think you should call the police. - [Alex] It’s OK, I’m fine, really. I’ll report it, I’ll report it. (phone ringing) - OK, Ms. Myers, we’ll do our best but I can’t promise you anything at all, OK? You may want to go to the hospital and get that looked at. - Yes, I’ll do that. - All right. As I said, if we find anything, we’ll give you a call. All right? - OK, thank you. - All right, you take care. - Daniels. - [Daniels] Hey, Stuart, what’s up? - What did that lady want? - She was filing an assault report. She was pretty upset too. - An assault. - [Daniels] Mm-hmm. - What, like roughed up? - Yep. - Can I see that? - Mmm-hmm. You know her? - Yeah, sort of. Give me a copy of this over at my desk, all right? - Not a problem, got it. - All right, thanks. - [Daniels] Yep. - What is this? - Open it. - OK, so? - So, what do you think? - What, you think Myers is the office killer? - Possibly. The truth is really I’m not sure. - There’s no fucking way, man. This chick’s on a whole new M.O. All the homicides are original. Besides, she doesn’t even sound Canadian. - So what? - (sighs) Look, man, this chick is a brand new case, I’m telling you. The killings don’t even match. - Well, I thought about that. She could have changed when she started up again to keep us off her ass. - No way. These guys always kill the same way, that’s their M.O. Look, Myers is not the office killer. - All right. (pulsating electronic music) Mr. Mills. I’m Detective Stu... - I know who you are, detective. - OK. - I couldn’t make out his face ’cause the reflection was totally blinding me. Maybe it was a bracelet or something. - Dr. Waller, can I get a moment of your time? Where were you the night of the 17th? - Am I a suspect now? - So, you’re wondering if she’s able to distinguish between the real and the unreal? - You know, you guys are all the same. You don’t trust anyone, you think everyone’s up to no good, and that everyone’s a criminal. - I do remember being blinded by something. Something that he was wearing. - As I mentioned before, she has a mild case of schizophrenia. She has dreams and has problems distinguishing at times the dreams from reality. - I can have you taken in for questioning. - Do it! Do it, goddamn it! Alexandra is a good person. And that’s nothing a man like you would ever understand. - Now, her case is mild and there have been cases that have been quite severe. - You want to arrest me? Here I am. - Now, I’ve told you just about everything I can, detective, so, if you need anything further, I would recommend you get a warrant. - [Stuart] I’m just trying to find out what happened. - No, you’re trying to hang an innocent person. (slam) (pulsating electronic music) - We’re holding her on murder. - And what evidence do you have? - Man, fuck you! - Hey, come on, let’s step outside for a minute. Come on. - Detective Warren, my client’s already told you she was with her boyfriend. Now, unless you’re making a formal arrest, based on solid evidence, we’re walking out of here. - You slimy piece of... - [Stuart] Hey, come on. We’ll be right back. You’re free to go, for now. - Come on, Alex, let’s get out of here. (ticking) - I’m telling you, Doc, I can’t take it anymore. They’re dying all around me like flies. - OK, calm down. - I could be next, I could be next. - [Doctor] OK, breathe, let’s do our breathing... - You can be next! My God, Jason could be next. - [Waller] I think it’s time to go to our comfort place. Close your eyes and try to relax. - I can’t, I gotta get out of here. - [Doctor] Alexandra, trust me. - I’m in danger! I’m in danger! - Alexandra, I want you to lay down and relax. Lay down and go to your comfort zone. Breathe. Breathe, in, out. Very good, very good. Now, tell me what you see. - I see a beach. (sighs) Sand. Miles and miles of ocean water. - Good, continue. (deep breathing) Tan hammock. Jason, he’s smiling. He’s drinking a coconut drink. - He’s waiting for you, isn’t he? Good, relax. Breathe. And you’re right there with him. Very good. - Honey, I’m home! Got the wine! Honey? (whistling) (suspenseful droning music) Honey? Honey? You sly thing, you. Honey, honey? My God. No wait, no! - Hey, those prints come in yet? - Yeah. Nothing except Russell’s. - Damn it. And Myers, what’s her story this time? - Boyfriend puts her at home at the exact same time. - That’s bullshit. - I don’t know. I think I believe him. - What? He’s fucking covering for her, man. - I’m just not convinced anymore. Let’s look at it for a second. The girl comes in with bruises one night, has a sound alibi. - Fuck that, man! She’s playin’ the sytem. You know they know how to do that. Fuck, man, she’s got us by the balls and she knows it. She’s got that fuckin’ asshole in on it with her. (phone ringing) - Hey. Yeah. Yep, I’m just gonna take a bath real quick and then I’ll be there later. Yeah, OK. All right, bye. (clink) Stanley? (lips smacking) What’s my little guy doing? Stanley? Here boy. (clink) Stanley? Stanley? What are you doing out there, Stanley? Stanley, come on. (lips smacking) Come here, Stanley. What did I tell you about knocking your water bowl over? Come on, buddy. Stanley. Come in here with Mommy. Where are you? (clink) Stanley. Come here with Mommy. Come on, buddy. Let’s go, Stanley. Stanley where are you? (suspenseful droning music) Stanley? I don’t have time for this. Stanley, come on. Forget it. (creepy droning music) (screams and splashing) (tense rumbling music) - Hard day? Hey, honey, good to see you too. Missed you, how was your day? You gonna tell me what’s going on? Hey? Whoa, what did I do? What’s going on? - You just don’t have a clue, do you? - Well, enlighten me. - You just don’t understand. - Understand what? What the hell’s going on, Alexandra? - My boss is dead. Murdered, OK? - What, Mr. Russell? What happened, how? - What happened, what happened? Damn it, Jason, he was murdered! OK, there’s people out there dying because of me! He’s after me! - Who’s after you? - I don’t know. I don’t know who’s after me but he’s out there killing everyone I know because he can’t get to me. I could be next, Jason. And the fucking cops, they think that I’m the killer! - The cops don’t know you’re the killer. - They don’t have to know it. They can lock you up on suspicion, Jason. We need to get out of town, OK? That’s what we need to do. I need you to start packing. - No, Alexandra. no. - Yes! OK, we’ll go to the bank. We’ll pull out all the money... - No! Alexandra stop it! I’m not leaving here. I’m not leaving my family. This will all blow over and work itself out. - Work itself out? Work itself out? Have you lost it, Jason?! There’s people dying because of me! OK, I could be next! You could be next! - Stop it, Alexandra, stop it! I won’t have it, I won’t. Now, you’re gonna call Dr. Waller and work this out. (crying) And the cops are gonna find the killer. And that’s it. - Jason... - No, don’t say another word. Or, so help me God, Alexandra, I will walk out that door and you will never see me again. Call Dr. Waller now. I’m going for a walk. - Jason. Jason. (crying) Doc, isn’t it possible that this could all just be a dream? - [Waller] Alexandra, we’ve already gone over this. - lt’s just that things like this don’t happen in real life. - [Waller] Alexandra, don’t you think that’s a pretty naive statement to make? - [Alex] OK, well not to me, at least. - Look, I agree with Jason, the police are going to find the real culprit and you, you need to focus and continue on with your therapy. That’s the best thing for you now. (suspenseful thrum) - [Alex] Hey, babe, it’s me. I have to work late so you’re on your own for dinner. Love you. - Alexandra? I’ll be heading home soon. Do you need anything else? - No, I’m OK, I just want to get this done before I leave. - OK, cool, I’ll see you tomorrow then. - Have a good night. - You too. (suspenseful droning music) (door creaks) Hello? Hey, Suze, is that you?! (door squeaks) (click) (suspenseful thrum) Hey, Suze, I’m in here! (suspenseful droning music) (screams) Oh, my God, Jesus! The lights in the bathroom, I was in there. - Oh, Ms. Myers, I’m terribly sorry. I didn’t know you were in there. - It’s OK, Jesus, it’s OK. - I’m terribly sorry, Ms. Myers. - [Alex] It’s OK, it’s OK, go back to work. (creepy humming music) (scream) What now? Jesus, I have to get this done. Are you OK? Jesus? Jesus! (pulsating electronic music) (heavy breathing) (tapping) - Alexandra. - Oh, my God! (clapping and voices on t.v.) - [Voiceover] Was convicted on first degree murder. Just after 6:30 tonight he was transferred here to Brokie County where he is spending his first night in jail. - [Voiceover] I just need to see the face of the person who did this. - [Voiceover] Onlookers gathered at the jail to get a glimpse of the man who was convicted of murdering local university professor, Steve Bully last winter. Investigators say Norton admitted to killing Bully after intense interrogation that lasted several hours and ended up being admissible in court. Even after the conviction though, Bully’s family and friends say that hey will not have peace, but at least justice has been... (dog barking) (tense droning music) - Fuckin’ kids. Mother fucker. (groan) (whack) (whumps) Mother fucker. (laughs) I fuckin’ knew it was you. (phone buzzing) Fuck. Piece of shit. (tense droning music) (knocking) - Sam, open up I got dinner! Hey, Sam. Shit. Sam. Sam! Goddamn it. Fuck. (gasps) (heavy breathing) Myers, fuck. (water running) - Jason?! (glass breaking) (creepy droning music) Jason, is that you? I know you were just there to see me. I know you would never hurt me. Jason? What is there to eat? Cake. Leftovers. There’s no ice cream, so cake it is. (screams) Jason, stop, please don’t do this to me! Jason! (groan) - Get someone over there now. (crash) (whumps) (groan) (tires squealing) - [Stuart] Freeze! (gunshot) (heavy breathing) - Jason. Oh, baby. Jason. I knew it wasn’t you. I’m sorry I ran from you. (crying) (crying) (birds chirping) - Hey, babe. What’s wrong? - Where’s the calendar? - [Jason] What calendar? - The gift you bought me, the calendar. - (laughs) Baby, I didn’t buy you a calendar, I bought you your favorite nail polish. Hey, hey. You’re OK, you’re OK. Here, I’ll do it for you. Hey, you’re OK. I gotta run. Try and have a good day, OK? Babe? - Yes? - When did you get this big knife?
