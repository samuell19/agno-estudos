No. No. No. Sensational, honey. Merely sensational. Is that a showman, or is that a showman? - How's Cassie? - Happy as a pig in a mud hole. That's our dressing room, alright. Oh, Cassie. What's the matter, sweetheart? Look what you've done. Aw. Dolly. Dolly! How'd it go, honey? Did you scare the pants off of 'em? You come here and clean this baby up. Alright. As soon as I finish making Mr. Duquesne's drink. Don't bother, I'll do it. = it's no bother. I said I will do it! Come on, sweetheart. Come on, come to... Oh, look at you. Aw, what a cute face. Did you want makeup on too? We'll get you all cleaned up. I had a little brother j j his name was tiny Tim j j I put him in the bathtub to teach him how to swim j j he drank up all the water j j he ate up all the soap j j he died last night with a bubble in his throat j j and... j Dolly, do you mind? Cassie likes it. She's smiling. It went beautifully tonight, Melinda. Just beautifully. You know, we may be able to get along without the rope hanging from the scaffold. I don't like the way it cuts off the circulation in your arms. Don't tamper with the trick. We've made money with it. I started using that trick in 1935. That's ten years ago. It's outlived itself. So it's good for another ten years, maybe 20. There's always a greater illusion, my friend. Melinda and I are planning an entirely new finale for the European tour. - Well, there we are. - All cleaned up for daddy. - Did the new costume arrive? - Oh, yes. There it is. Came while you were on stage. Uh-huh. Hold it up, Melinda, so we can get a good look. It's a knockout, but what's it for? Marie antoinette, the new finale. They'll eat it up in France. Come on, we'll show him. =I don't want to. I'm tired. - It'll only take a second. - I don't want to. Come on, darling. It'll just be a minute. Come along, Mr. press agent, we'll show you something you can really rave about. Cassie, you've got the most wonderful daddy in the world. Tonight, we'll come back after a good dinner and rehearse it. There it is, buzz. Designed it myself. The workmen just finished it. So that's the contraption you put out five grand for, huh? It's a lot for one trick. = [it'll be worth it. Think of the tie-in for a French audience. Beheading of Marie antoinette. I'll show you how it works. You'll run through an awful lot of wives with that contraption. Isn't it a darling little machine, Melinda? No American home should be without one. Here we go. Duke, that's Cassie's doll. I'll get her another in the morning. A poor substitute for you, my dear. The darn things never work when you really need them. Hello. Miss Duquesne? = yes. I'm very sorry I'm late. My plane was a bit delayed. - Are the services over? - We were just about to begin. Please accept my sincerest sympathy. Thank you. Thank you for all you've done, sir. If you'll wait over there for just a moment. Alright, thank you. Excuse me. Melinda. Who's the blonde? I don't know, but I wonder what she's doing after the funeral. Cassie, honey. Don't you remember me? It's Dolly. Dolly bast. Remember? I was your nursemaid. This is buzz Sheridan. I was your father's manager and press agent. I-I can't get over it, you look exactly like your mother. Like she's come back after all these years. Hey, Sheridan. Come here a minute. Oh, excuse me, Cassie. Do you expect us to believe this? Alright. Alright. So you don't believe it. So it's no skin off my teeth, go on home. He meant that he'd positively return from the other side? He said he'd try. He thought he could. He will, Cassie. Yes, he will. Come on, what's he gonna do? Jump out of the grave? You never can tell. Not with the great Duquesne, you can't. - Keep your eyes open. - Ready to begin, miss Duquesne. Perhaps you will want to stand beside me. Just one second, reverend, if you please. Alright, fellows. What are those for? It was his last wish. He said he didn't want to do anything the easy way. No. Stop that. Don't do that. = wait. Wait. Cassie. - Stop it! - Cassie, please. Mr. Sheridan, please stop this. It's what he wanted, Cassie. He wanted this chain, the casket with the window in it? This is the most inexcusable, tasteless thing. - I quite agree, miss Duquesne. - And so do I, reverend. Your father made me promise. I gave my word as his friend. You gave your word for what? In turning something reverend into a cheap theatrical sideshow like this? What kind of a friend are you? I've never been so disgusted in my life. What's this about, Sheridan? = who is she? - Is this Duquesne's daughter? - What's going on, Sheridan? Yes. Yes. Yes. She's Duquesne's daughter. - She came from back east for... - She's the daughter? Miss Duquesne? Miss Duquesne? Miss Duquesne? - Just a few words. - Please, just a moment. - No. - How about a picture? How do you feel about your father coming back from the grave? Did he say anything to you about it? I didn't know my father. I haven't heard or seen him for about 20 years. There's really nothing I can say or I care to say. - Please leave me alone. - Get a picture. No. No. Stop it. I told you not to do that. Well, it did us a lot of good. Let's get back to Sheridan. It can't be a cheap grab for attention. Why not? Since when does a dead man need publicity? Since egocentric hams came into existence. - Oh, no. No. - Duquesne was one of the worst. No, it's something else. Has to be. Twenty years ago, he was at the height of his career. He has money, fame, and the works. And like that, he retires. Withdraws from public, from his friends. Just doesn't sound like a publicity-seeking ham to me. I'm listening. Well, something happened. I think it had to do with this. I know all about it. I wrote this story myself when I was a reporter. You... Well, now, why didn't you tell me that, huh? Duquesne loved her very much. When she walked out on him and the baby, that was it. He just cracked up. His world was gone. Didn't he ever try to find her? Police did. Came up with nothing. Evidently, Melinda wanted to get good and thoroughly lost. And she succeeded. Another man? Mm, lot of people thought so. It's too bad. She was a beautiful woman. Yeah. I saw her today. - What? - Duquesne's daughter. She looks exactly that. Exactly. She came for the funeral. Her father's will's being read tomorrow. Where has she been all this time? Some place in Wisconsin. Seems they farmed her out to an old maternal aunt after her mother's disappearance. Never knew her father. Where did you learn all this? From her. Drove her back from the cemetery. Well, might make a nice little human interest story. Well, could be. "Abandoned in life, meet only at graveside," something like that. Could you set up an interview in the morning? No, I'm afraid not. She's allergic to printer's ink. Well, evidently she talked to you. Yeah, well, actually, she... She doesn't know I'm a reporter. So, who says you are? Mr. Carmichael, you have a wicked and devious mind. - You know where she's staying? - Mm-hm, but she won't be there. She'll be at the reading of her father's will. By the way, it's being held here. By Duquesne's express wish. An old ham. Difficult. Difficult of him. Even in death, he does everything in style. As if the dignity of the legal profession were being used for some amateur theatrical. I knew your father only slightly, miss Duquesne. But frankly, had he told me that these proceedings would be held under such ridiculous circumstances, I would've refused to represent his estate. I hope you don't find my attitude uncharitable. Also, I should like to make it abundantly clear that the late Mr. Duquesne made out this will without any legal assistance whatsoever. However, as far as I can determine, it's all legal. Properly signed and witnessed according to law. Like we shouldn't get any ideas about contesting it, huh? Shame on you. Whatever Duke wanted, it's our duty to obey. - We owe him that. - Yes, well... "I, John hanley Duquesne, being of sound mind and body, do hereby bequeath all my property to my daughter Cassandra in the Sincere hope that she may forgive me for these many long years of neglect.” Well, darling, you can't win 'em all, huh? Please, Mr. Sheridan. There is a condition attached. "I ask my daughter Cassandra, who, being my only flesh and blood kin, is the one person on earth most closely attuned to my immortal spirit, to assist me in my hope of returning from the dead by taking up residence for a minimum period of seven days in the house where I lived these past 25 years. The home to which my spirit will return and make its presence known to her. I make it a binding condition that she be in the house each night between the hours of midnight and dawn. If for any reason, whatsoever, not excluding illness or death my daughter is unwilling or unable to accede to this condition, I direct that my estate be divided up as follows. One half to my loyal manager and press agent Mr. Jules "buzzy" Sheridan to join those sums he has stolen from me in the past. And one half to Ms. Dolly bast, in appreciation for having given me, as she never tired of pointing out, the best years of her life. Signed, John hanley Duquesne.” That ends the reading of the testament. Miss Duquesne, may I speak to you for a moment, please? May I congratulate you, miss Duquesne. - This is the key to the house. - Thank you. $300,000 is a great deal of money, miss Duquesne. Should you in the future need any advice on investments, trusts, anything at all, please, feel free to call me. Thank you very much. I'm very sorry he didn't leave either of you anything. He did, honey. He left us a lot of memories. He was a great man. Dolly, Mr. vickers was telling me at breakfast how you have taken care of my father all of these years. You're perfectly welcome to stay at the house if you'd like. No. I-l couldn't do that. I'll come out sometime next week to pick up my things. Really, please feel free to. = no. It's you he wants to come back to. Hi. Well, hello. What are you doing here? I remembered you were coming out this morning. Thought you might like lunch. Oh, no, thanks. I've got a lot to do before this evening. How did the will go? Your father leave anything to you? Well, yes. Everything. Why are you so interested? Well, as I said, I'm an admirer of your father's. You know that old house of his always fascinated me. - You going out there? - Later. Well, it's an hour's drive north of here. Be happy to take you out if you like. No, thanks. Not to be rude, but I think I can make it on my own. Goodbye. Somebody here expectin' you? Mm, nobody. You mean, you're gonna stay here all by yourself? Yes. Well, good luck. Hi. - Sorry. - What are you doing here? It's what I told you at the bowl. I'm interested in the house. Oh. = yeah. I work for my uncle. He's a builder. He's had an eye on your father's place. Kind of interesting, isn't it? Sorry, I forgot your name. = val Henderson. What he has in mind is putting up an exclusive subdivision. With modern homes, maybe a shopping center, a bowling alley... Mr. Henderson, I'm not very interested. Will you excuse me? Miss Duquesne, this could be an important project for this area. That's fine. I don't know what your business ethics are, if you have any. They certainly don't seem to include any decency. My father was buried yesterday. Miss Duquesne, if I could have one more moment of your time. I'm gonna level with you. I feel terrible, I really do. It was my uncle's idea. He said, "you get out there and get a deal or you are fired." He's not a very nice man, miss Duquesne. How about it, huh? If I thought those reporters at the funeral were contemptible, I think that you and your uncle are beneath contempt. Now, are you gonna go? Yeah. What is it? What happened? Oh, it's on a wire. Runs up to that cabinet up there. I just pressed that switch by the door. I thought it was the light switch. Your father must have been a million laughs. Come on, let's find the real light switch. Here it is. He couldn't have had much of an electric bill. I've seen better lighting in the tunnel of love. I guess he liked the atmosphere dark and mysterious like this. Uh-huh. - We've got a visitor. - Hey, isn't he cute? - Yeah. - What are you doing here? Every magician has to have a rabbit. For pulling out of hats. Hope he didn't have two. It'd get awful crowded in here. - Here we go. - I'll take care of you later. I don't think I'd better leave until we've checked this place. - Oh? - Well, it's the least I can do. Alright, thanks. = you're welcome. Well, shall we go get acquainted? Uh, with the rest of the house. Yup. Well, let's start on the lower floor. Okay. First catacomb to the left. Here we have the boer war with the original cast. Coming up, old aunt Harry. She wasn't feeling too well that day. Well, here's a nice-looking door, right here. It's a music room. = yeah. - You play anything? - Uh-huh, little golf. I meant a musical instrument. No. I never was much good at that kind of thing. - Hey, what's in here? - That's a little parlor. Well, I better find a place to sleep. Come on. Let's try upstairs. Hey, how many stories has this place got? Looks like at least four to me. I don't know, but I think we're gonna get plenty lost. Don't worry, I'm half St. Bernard. E-flat. - Take your pick. - Well, that one. Okay. "Welcome to the twilight zone." What are these? - These... - It's my father. Yeah. He used these molds to make rubber masks of himself. What for? = his act. He'd have an assistant wear one of these on stage. The audience would think it was the great Duquesne himself. Then the assistant would disappear through a trap door. Two seconds later, the real Duquesne would be walking down the aisle from the back of the theatre. If your father didn't scare them to death downstairs with that skeleton, he probably finished them off in here. Ugh. Look at this. You remember these? You could get a heck of a manicure with that. Look at all this stuff. Hey, these swords. They're real. Sharp too. Must have been used for one of those human pincushion tricks. Mr. Henderson? Mr. Henderson. Mr. Henderson? Where are you? Hey. Hey! You quit playing games with me now. Where are you? Mr. Henderson. Mr. Henderson? Mr. Henderson, will you answer me? - Mr. Henderson. - Stick 'em up. What are you doing scaring me like that? I didn't do it on purpose. I mean, I did it on purpose. I did this on purpose. Not that, in there. I went in this cabinet out of curiosity. I pushed a button and the back of it gave way. Found myself in another room. That one. Really? = yeah. Oh, you scared me to death. Didn't feel good about it myself. It went back like that. Look at my hands. They're still shaking. You scare that easy? = oh, I don't know. I've never been through anything like this before. My first haunted house. Except it's not haunted, is it? Haunted houses have ghosts. This one just has tricks. Shall we continue the tour? You really scared me to death down there, you. Well, I have that effect on a lot of people. Maybe this is a bedroom. Ah. Madam, your boudoir. Oh. She was very beautiful, wasn't she? Still is. Oh, how strange. Do you realize this is the closest I've been to my mother? Gives me a funny feeling... Being in her room... Looking like her, among her things. You know, I think this is gonna sound ridiculous, but... See, I was just two years old when she disappeared, but... I really think I can remember her. The way she looked. The way she smelled, you know, like soap. She used to put her hand on my forehead. Always really soft. My aunt Elizabeth had hands like sandpaper. Is she the aunt who raised you in Wisconsin? Yeah. Didn't you get along? My aunt Elizabeth? Oh, yeah. She was just too old to have a child in the house, I guess. Actually, you know, she was very good. Very strict but very fair. Didn't your mother ever try to contact you all these years? No. Why blame her? Neither did my father. My aunt Elizabeth used to talk like this, she'd say, "good riddance to both of them. Consider yourself lucky. Stage folk. Morally irresponsible.” etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. When I was a kid, I used to pretend that my dad just loved my mother deeply. And he loved me too. And he was just around the corner, just waiting to come to me. You're an amazing person, Cassie. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. How come? Because you have every reason to be bitter and you're not. Bitter. That is just a word that angry people use to hide the fact they wanna be loved. That's all. By her. By him. I've wanted that all my life, too much to hide behind bitterness. Your father left you everything. Left you this house. He must have loved you. Then why all the years of neglect? Well, I can't answer that one, Cassie. Only he could've told you that. Well, look. I'll go downstairs and get your suitcases. You just relax there for a while. Okay. Hey. Don't bring the smaller one. It's full of cold roast beef sandwiches. What? Do you like cold roast beef sandwiches? Yeah. Are you asking me for dinner? If you like cold roast beef sandwiches, I'm asking. I'm accepting. Okay. - What is it? - This silly thing scared me. Yeah. Well, he doesn't seem too pleased to see us. - Do you feel any better? - Mm. Sandwich helps. - You want another one? - No, thanks. I had plenty. But my compliments to a most charming hostess. Oh, thank you, gallant sir. Cassie, you know, I don't think you ought to stay here alone. I'm not gonna be alone. Mr. vickers, he's my attorney. He said he'd arrange for a housekeeper to stay with me. She'll be here sometime tomorrow. I meant tonight. Oh, I'll be alright. I'm just gonna jump into bed and stay there. I promise to open no doors, no closets, no nothing. I've had enough practical jokes for one day. Yeah, I guess you have. - Val? - Hm? Tell me something about yourself. All I know about you is your name. Val Henderson and you work in real estate with your uncle. There's not much to tell really. I'm just an ordinary guy. After the gypsies captured me from the palace and my wicked twin took over the throne nothing much happened. I was captured by pirates. Spent some years as a white hunter in Africa and then became an international Jewel thief. Are you ever serious? Sure. Sometimes I get very serious. Val, I'm awfully tired. Okay. - Lemme walk you home. - Okay. Only as far as the stairs, now. Yes. I think it's a dreadful shame that you're wasting your time in real estate being a Jewel thief and all. Actually, I lied to you about that, I'm not in real estate. - Oh. What do you do? - Same old thing. Brain surgery. Well. Goodnight. Thanks. You're welcome. Goodnight. What was that? =I don't know. Val? Let's go find out. Shh, shh, shh. Sounds like a woman crying, doesn't it? Yeah. Where's it coming from? I don't know. Sounds like it's coming from everywhere. It's dying down. Don't leave me. Who knows you're here? I don't know. Vickers, Dolly. Or Sheridan, maybe. Hello? Hello? Who is this, please? It's a man. He's just breathing. Hello? Don't hang up. Who is this, please? Hello? Hello? I knew it'd be something like this. That sobbing too. Hi-fi. Turn it off! Cassie, it's a recording. I don't care. It's as if the whole house were breathing. Listen, um... I'm not letting you stay alone tonight. I'll sleep on that couch. - You alright? - Uh-huh. Look, I think we can use a night cap too. Come on, it'll do us both good. Hey! What are you doing up there? Oh, hi. I found these keys in the kitchen. None of them works. I think the sound we heard came from in there. You mean, the sobbing? = no, no, no. The chains. I got the sobbing figured out. = mm. - Yeah, see that ventilator? - Yeah? I went all over the house. There must be dozens of those. I think the sound came up from somewhere down below up through the ventilation system and echoed throughout. But from where down below? =I don't know. He probably had another tape recorder stashed somewhere. I got a feeling this whole place is rigged for stereo. Wish I could find the key to that door. - What do you think you'll find? - Hmm... Maybe the world's largest collection of sound effects tapes. How you feeling? = oh, fine. Things sure look better in the morning, right? - Yeah, let's have breakfast. - Okay. - Breakfast? - Yeah. While you were asleep, I drove down on the highway. Found a store about five miles down. How doth the busy little bee. Not too well. Dropped the eggs. You like scrambled eggs? I love scrambled eggs. =you're on. Come on. Oh, isn't this charming? Coffee's hot. Eggs are cold. Ooh, look at these. = yeah. I didn't know you could cook. Thought I closed that. Huh? Oh, sure, sure. Why don't you marry me? Haven't tasted your eggs yet. Where does this door go? It goes to the basement. Went through it this morning. Dusty. Hey, let's try the coffee. Oh... okay. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. - Coffee. - Just like uptown. - There you go. - Thank you. - Mmm. - Ah, you like it, huh? Mmm, it's very bad. It grows on you. Now, that sound is real. - Hey, you expecting someone? - Yeah, the new housekeeper. - Come on. - Oh, yeah. Ah... Well, come on. Um, yeah. - Hey, what's her name? - Mrs. ryerdon. Does she know what kind of job she's taking? Don't know. Mr. vickers said he got her from employment office. I hope she's got a good sense of humor. That'll be $15. Hello there. Well, how you doing? = fine. You must be Mrs. ryerdon. = the name's Ramona. Ramona. Well, it's a very romantic name. Well, don't get any ideas. You Mrs. Duquesne? No, ma'am, miss Duquesne. My friend, val Henderson. - Hi. - Not your husband? - No. - No, no. She wouldn't have me. Doesn't like my cooking. Oh, I'll get it. Right that way. Hm. Who owns this? I don't like open cars. I can't stand them. Oh, let me get that. Right there. Now, I want you to know I don't cook. Just straight housework. Light housework is my business. Yes, I understand perfectly. That's fine. Ramona, did Mr. vickers tell you anything about this house? Nope. Not a thing. Why? Something I ought to know? Oh, nothing special. Just some things, I'll explain 'em later. Smells awfully dusty in here. We'll get someone to do the heavy cleaning. It won't be bad. Big houses, they get mighty drafty and I catch colds easy. Oh? Well, we were very comfortable last night. - Warm as toast. Right, val? - Yes, yes. We? That's nice. She means last evening. It was just perfect. - It was a little noisy, maybe. - Noisy? Ramona, my father left me this house and he was a magician. Sort of a practical joker too, wasn't he, val? Yes, yes. Sure was. So it's possible that you just might hear things. Wh-what kind of things? I don't know exactly. Some noises, something like that. Well, it's something that sounds like a woman crying. You don't believe in ghosts, do you, Mrs. ryerdon? - Val. - Ghosts? Uh-huh. No. We were having coffee. Have some before I get you a room. - Might make me feel better. - Yeah, right down here. Uh, Mrs. ryerdon. Would you care for this last piece of toast? - Huh? - Would you care for toast? No, I don't eat much breakfast. Ah. Say, where did you say that crying came from? You see that door there? = yeah. Well, that goes to the basement. It came from down there, we think. Val, stop. Ramona, I wouldn't worry about it. I think it's just a practical joke, a record or something. Arecord of a woman crying? = mm-hm. There ain't no such thing. = no. - Well, I better get with it. - Mm. I wonder where they put the vacuum cleaners around here. Gosh, I don't know. Have another cup of coffee... Oh, here it is. Miss. Duquesne. I put in my eight hours every working day. That's what I get paid for, see. Then I relax on my own time. Thought I'd help you later if you want. You have your coffee. I'll get up on that front hall. And I don't need help. When I do a job, I do it! Yes, ma'am. I get the distinct impression Mrs. ryerdon isn't ever going down in that basement. Me too. I don't care. I feel better having somebody around. Oh, thanks a lot. Where have I been? Oh, I don't mean that. I mean, here, from now on, permanently. You've been very nice, sir. Yeah, lots of laughs. Hey, let me pour you a cup of coffee. Alright. Guess you'll be kinda anxious to get back to the city, huh? Oh, no. No, no. I'm in no hurry. Matter of fact, I've gotten attached to this old place. Oh, you have, huh? = mm-hm. There's something about it I like. Hmm. Did she say the front hall? = mm-hm. Oh, my gosh, what if... She did. Hmm. Get the wild animals out of here. Oh, ah, get that wild animal away from me. Lift me. It's just a trick, Ramona. Try and relax. - Oh, this is a crazy house. - I'm sorry. I want to get out of here. You're crazy. Please, Ramona. I want to talk for a minute. I wanna get out of this crazy house. - Ramona, please. - I've gotta get outta here. Troublemaker. I guess you'd better hurry if you're gonna get. Let me help you, Mrs. ryerdon. - There we go... - Please, I'll do it myself. Yes, ma'am. Open cars. I told you I didn't like open cars. When I first saw it, I didn't like it. Yes, ma'am. Well. - You can't win 'em all, huh? - Yeah, that's right. Look, let's forget about that house today. Let's go somewhere. Alright. Hey, what about your job? Oh, I have a very indulgent uncle. It's a beautiful day, let's find some normal everyday people and have a relaxed afternoon, what do you say? Go. It's two down and one to go. The lady wins the big prize. She's got the ball. She's winding up, and there she goes. The lady wins a prize. The safety valve pillow. Especially designed for pretty girls - thank you. - Oh, that's wonderful. Keep pitching, pal. Keep pitching, boy. Yes, step right up, folks... You tired? Oops. - We must have walked miles. - Yeah, we did. What time is it getting to be? - Like 5:00. - Hmm. Maybe we should think about getting back to the house soon. We'll stop at the grocery store, get some groceries. Because you're invited for dinner, alright? Yeah, fine, fine. Great. Hey. I've had an awful lot of fun today, val Henderson. Thanks. You're welcome. So have I. - Cassie. - Hm. Do yourself a favor. - What's that? - Don't go back to that house. I have to. That's the agreement. Yeah, I know. Seven days. Midnight till dawn. Break the agreement, no $300,000, dear. Yeah, I know, I know. Besides... A day away from it, it even becomes kinda funny, doesn't it? As a matter of fact, believe it or not, I miss it. It's my own private amusement park, that's what it is. Cassie, you know, you're, uh... - You're very impressionable... - Mm. Yeah, you are, and you're sensitive and... I think you're lonelier than you'll admit. Well, daddy is gonna show up any night now and I won't be alone. He gave you a bad time last night. It could get worse. Yeah. Building up to a tremendous finale. Ouch. Ta-da! Back from the dead! Yeah, what if he does come back? You're not gonna go psychic on me now, are you? No, but I think if you spend... You spend too many nights alone in that house, it'll start to get to you. You mean I'm so sensitive and impressionable that I'll be seeing things? Or doing things. Maybe even dangerous things. - Like? - Like, uh... Like maybe getting scared out of your wits. Like running blindly down that staircase. Like maybe breaking your neck. Please, darling. My pretty neck. - Your exquisite neck. - Hm, that's better. So what? So, if I conjure him up, what do you think I'm gonna see? We see what we want to see, Cassie. Then there's no problem. He'll be tall and strong. Well... he'll be handsome anyway. And he'll be loving and he'll be great fun to be around. I'll tell you what. Let's forget about shopping. We'll drive down the coast highway. We'll stop at a little spot. Get a steak, a bottle of wine. Uh-oh. = we'll have some soft talk. - Hm. - Candlelight. - What kinda talk? - Soft.

Val? Dolly bast. What is it? What happened? What're you doing here? What's the matter? What's she doing? Don't know, but something really scared her. What is it, Dolly? What frightened you? Well, I saw, I... You saw what? What did you see? I, um, your father. Up there. He was at the top of the stairs. He was standing there. That's impossible. You stay here. I saw him. If you'd believed. If you'd loved him, like I did. Like I do. - But I do love him. - Oh, but you don't need him. Only I need him. Only I can't live without him. Dolly, there's a room at the top of the stairs. It's locked. It was always locked. He was the only one who ever went in it. What's in it? I don't know. - You know where the key is? - Yes. Well, where is it? Get it for us. I can't. It was buried in his grave with him. It was his wish. Come on, let's go downstairs. I've come here every night since he died just to be near his things. - His memory. - We heard you last night. You must have loved him a great deal to cry for him like that. And yet, in the end, I failed him. Even I failed him. You failed him, how? He must have known he was dying. He kept it to himself. He wanted to spare me the pain of it. He made me go away for a week, a vacation. The next time I saw him he was dead in his coffin. He died alone. I'll never forgive myself that. He needed somebody around him, all through the end. Then why didn't he ever try to contact me? You don't know how lonely it was. Don't I? Well, don't you think a thing like that works both ways? Why didn't you try to reach him? Because I didn't think he cared. Cared? He worshipped you. He did? Oh. Oh, Dolly, if I've made a mistake all these years... I've got to know. Please tell me something. I don't think I could say "forgive me" to a memory, but... But I want to. Please tell me. Twenty years ago. The night your mother went away. It was the end of the world to him. He wouldn't believe she was gone. Night after night, he'd sit out front in the music room. He'd say, "darling, where's Melinda? She hasn't played her harp or sung for me for a week. Where is she?" We'd walk all over the house searching for Melinda. He had tape recordings of her singing and playing, and I'd play one of them and he'd get easy in his mind and he could sleep again, but the next night it would be the same all over again. Are you saying Cassie's father went mad after his wife left? Grief can drive you mad, if you love deeply enough. Your aunt Elizabeth came and got you, Cassie. And that's not a scene I care to remember. I can imagine that, poor darling. Then, three months ago, he saw your picture in the paper. With a story of you being chosen for a club or something. He said, "look, Dolly. It's Melinda." I tried to tell him it was you, Cassie, but he just kept saying, "it's Melinda. I've found my Melinda,” over and over. And that afternoon, I typed a long letter to you begging his Melinda to come back, and then I mailed it. I didn't get the letter. It was sent back unopened. Aunt Elizabeth. Val. He got worse after that letter came back. He'd lost his Melinda for the second time. And l... I think that's when he began to die. Oh, Dolly, I'm so sorry. If only I'd known. He's come back, Cassie. He's come back. Cassie, can I talk to you for just a minute, please? Alone. - Alone? - Yeah, it's important. It'll just take a minute. Come on. Get your coat. We're taking Dolly to that bus station. What? I was going to ask her to stay here. I was afraid you were going to say something like that. We're getting her out of here, Cassie. - Why? - 'Cause she's not good for you. Besides, I think she's putting on the performance of her life. Val, that's ridiculous. Do you believe she saw your father's ghost on the staircase? Mm? = no. Alright, what did she see? - Well, she saw something. - What? A shadow? The rabbit? I don't know. Maybe it's as you said at the amusement park, val. She's a person who sees what she wants to see and needs to see. And so are you. You keep her needling you and bugging you, she'll have you seeing spooks in a few days. So, I'll be seeing spooks? You really believe. You actually want to believe. That's nonsense and you know it. Why are you defending her? = I'm not. - Cassie, listen to yourself. - I'm not defending her. You're angry because I'm talking you outta something you want to believe. But you can't wish the dead back to life. Not for all the love or all the need in the world. I know that. Alright. It just seems like a... simple act of kindness that I can do for Dolly for taking care of my father. Cassie, I-l don't think that what Dolly is doing deserves any act of kindness from you. What do you mean? If you're scared outta this house before the seven days, who stands to gain? - Well, Dolly and Sheridan. - Dolly and Sheridan. Now, val, I told you that was ridiculous. Now, she saw something on the stairs. She was terrified. Cassie, I think she has you more hooked than you realize. Don't let her stay around you. - Val. - Cassie, please. Okay. Okay. You win. Alright, get your coat. No. Will you take her please? I'd like a glass of hot milk and I'd like to go to bed. Alright. Well, you sure you'll be alright? Yes. I suppose you think that Sheridan's up in that locked room there waiting to scare me out of my wits, huh? - Will you hurry back? - I'll hurry back. I'll be waiting. You sure you can make it back to town? Yes. I gotta find buzz and tell him what happened tonight. Mm-hmm. Where'll you find buzz? At a place called big Mike's. It's a bar. Buzz practically lives there. I've gotta tell him. He'll wanna know that Duquesne came back. Yeah. I'll bet he'll wanna know. Duquesne coming back. Why don't you come off it? I got a little advice for you. Well, that should be interesting. Don't you think I don't know who you are? So don't you be so smart with me. Who am 1? You're... some wise punk who's just after her money. That's who you are. Well, you won't get a dime. Who'll stop me? You and Sheridan? - Duquesne, that's who's... - Duquesne? Duquesne's gonna stop you because he loves his daughter. It's been a great performance, Dolly. Damn you. Vaudeville's dead. Nobody's asking for an encore. You're gonna be sorry. - Goodnight. - You're gonna be... Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! I what j j is this thing j I called j j love? J j this funny thing & I called love j j just who can solve j j its mystery j j why should it; I make a fool of me j J I saw you there j j one wonderful day j you took j j my heart j j and threw it away j J that's why I ask the lord... j - Oh, val. - Honey, what is it? Honey, what happened? - Look. - What is it? Look. Looks real, alright. Real wax. That's me, that's me. It's a likeness of your mother. They must have used it in some magic act or... How did it get here? It was in the box at the top of the stairs. The rabbit knocked it over at me. Honey, it's alright. Are you okay? Oh, val, I feel so funny. My head is spinning. It's enough to drive anyone bats. Oh, hold me. Please hold me. I'm here. I'm here. Look, what you need is to get some rest. Now you come on. Come on. Let's go upstairs. It's okay. I still don't know what you're gonna get out of Sheridan. Well, I don't either, but it's worth a try. If Dolly and Sheridan are behind this, he's not gonna admit it. Maybe he'll give himself away by covering up too much. Anyway, I want to talk to Dolly again, while she's sober. You sure you don't wanna come along? Nope. I'm going to change my clothes, putter in the garden, and then I'm going to lie in the sun for hours and hours and hours. It'll do you good. - See you later. - Bye. Hello, big Mike around? You're looking at him, mister. What can I do for you? Uh... I'm trying to find buzz Sheridan. I'll get him for you. He doesn't like to be awakened abruptly. Uh-huh. Thanks. Buzz. Buzz. Buzz! There's somebody here to see you. Hmm? = Mr. Sheridan? My name is val Henderson. I'm a friend of Cassie Duquesne. Oh, yeah. I know. Dolly told me. She called me up last night. Thanks. She told me the whole bit. She believes he came back from the dead to her, so why spoil it? Well, I'm trying to help Cassie Duquesne. Dolly told me what you suspect. Um-hmm. Well, you're wrong, mister. You're dead wrong. You can accuse Dolly of all kinds of things, but she would never do anything to harm Duquesne's daughter. And just in case you got any ideas about me, you can forget 'em. I loved Duke. Something glowed from him. A remarkable presence. Maybe a man like that never does really die. His presence is still all around. And maybe he can come back from the dead. Do you really believe that? I wish it. Dolly wishes it. Let's be honest, Mr. Sheridan. Don't you also wish that you and Dolly could make a two-way split of $300,000? I don't have to listen to you. Dolly took care of him for 20 years. He didn't leave her a dime. Now she's no Saint. Wouldn't she expect something? So go talk to Dolly. You know her number, Mr. Sheridan? I know her number. 4630799. It's a rooming house. And you're way off base, mister. Mike, you should really delouse this joint. Miss Duquesne? What are you doing here? Who are you? My name is Joe Russell. Can I ask you a few questions? - About what? - You know miss Dolly bast? Yes, I do. Is something wrong? She called us this morning. Said your father kept his word. Came back... from the grave last night. Now I know who you are. You're one of the reporters at the funeral, aren't you? I wanted to check her story out with you before we... - Cassie. - Over here, val. - I'll only take a few minutes. - I'm very sorry. - It'll only take a second. - Whose car is that out... Hey, val. Well, what do you know? No wonder you wouldn't give me the story. Boy, do you move fast. - You know each other? - Well, I... Sure. We worked together on the daily exchange. That's my paper, before he moved over to the journal. We've known each other for four... - Cassie! - Did I do something wrong? Cassie. Cassie, wait a minute. Come on, honey. Wait. = no. Lemme talk to him. = you lied to me. - If you knew I'm a reporter... - No, don't. Just a minute. You wouldn't let me near you. Now I started out for a story, I admit. That's all changed now. You don't have to explain anything to me. Just go. It's a hell of a time to tell you but I'm in love with you. If you have any decency, val, please go. I've asked you to go. Come off it now, Cassie. What's so terrible about... I want you to go write your newspaper story about this silly heiress you fooled into letting you stay in the magician's house. And into falling in love. Yeah. And into... Cassie. Cassie! Now open the door! Very sorry, val, but how was I to know? Yeah, yeah. Cassie, now open the door! Cassie! Cassie. Cassie, open the door. I want to explain. I want you to understand. Cassie! Vall vall Operator? Operator! Operator, get me the number of a val Henderson, please. Henderson. I don't know. In Los Angeles some place. Please hurry. Please. Oh, please be home val, please. Hello. Oh, val, thank god you're there. I need you. Cassie, what's the matter? The room upstairs, the one that was always locked. There's a box in there... With a body. A body of a woman with no head. Please, it was horrible. Get hold of yourself. It can't be real. It must be one of his props. I don't care! I don't care. Please get me out of here. Wait a minute. Listen to me. Lock the door, don't let anyone in. Alright? Now, Cassie, get a hold of yourself. Please hurry. Please. I'll be there as soon as I can. No! No! No! - Don't touch me! - Don't be frightened, please. You're alive. You're not a ghost. You're alive. You faked that whole thing. Your death, your funeral. Why? Why? You wouldn't come back to me. But-but I would have come if I'd known you wanted me to. You returned my letter. Years of waiting, and then when I found you, you refused me. No, I didn't get the letter. Believe me, if I'd gotten the letter I would have come to you. You would have? I didn't think you wanted me. If you only knew how I hoped and prayed for this. I wanted you to want me. To love me. But I always loved you, Melinda. Melinda. No. Melinda. Duke? It's you. It's really you. Melinda's come back, Dolly. She's come back. Oh, no. No, that's not Melinda. That's Cassie. Your daughter, Cassie. No, I know you've been jealous of Melinda all these years, but you can't lie anymore, Dolly. She's come back. Daddy, I'm not Melinda. = Melinda's dead. No. No. Yes. Yes, she's gone. She died that night, Duke. I brought her here myself. I buried her in the woods behind the house. No, that's not true. That's not true, Dolly. Melinda... Melinda's here. Dolly? How did my mother die? The trick, the guillotine. Something went wrong. I know it will work now, Melinda. I know it'll work. = don't touch her. - Melinda. - No, don't take me. Cassie, run! Cassie, run! No. No, Duke. Duke, you mustn't do this thing. Don't. No, she's not Melinda. Duke, she's Cassie. Listen to me, Duke. You can't do this. = get outta here! Operator. Operator, get me the police. You see, Melinda? I saved it. Saved everything all through the years. Dolly, what are you doing out here? Duquesne... he's back. - He didn't die. - What? It was another one of his illusions to get Cassie here. Where's Cassie? = she's with him. He thinks it's Melinda. He's gonna use the guillotine again. The guillotine? That's how Melinda died that night. He never would accept that. He never believed she was dead. Come on. Ladies and gentlemen. Behold one of the most tragic and maligned figures in... in all the... The annals of recorded history. The beauteous Marie antoinette. Doomed by the... by the... By the... Bestial malevolence of the revolutionary mob to end her glorious life upon this... this cruel instrument of bloody torture. La belle dame sans merci. And why did she have to die? For allegedly having remarked, upon being informed that the poor had no bread, "why then, let them eat cake.” Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen. Is that a statement showing heartlessness, or... or merely a warm, generous and delightful humor? No, no. Kindly take your seat. Dolly, don't you understand? Usher the gentleman to his seat. I'm glad you came, sir. And now, before your very eyes, you're about to see the ghastliest, cruelest, most sickening act of legal vengeance ever enacted upon a beautiful woman. The actual beheading of... Of... Of Marie antoinette. It is October the 16th, the year of our lord 1793. The hour, 15 minutes past the stroke of noon. Oh, if you're squeamish, sir, close your eyes. If you're faint of heart, turn aside. Oh-oh, better still, perhaps you should leave the auditorium. Mr. Duquesne. Ah... um... The follow spot. The follow spot, Mr. Duquesne, it's not working. The audience can't see you. Oh, my god. Cassie? Cassie, Cassie. I was so afraid. Cassie, it's alright now. - Cassie, I thought that the... - I was so afraid. It's alright. Now you're safe. It's okay now. It's all over. Oh, val... - Oh, look at my father. - It's alright now. Come on, let me get you out of this thing. See, Melinda? I made it work. I made it work. Oh, daddy, please don't cry. - What's going on? - Upstairs. Come on, Dave.
