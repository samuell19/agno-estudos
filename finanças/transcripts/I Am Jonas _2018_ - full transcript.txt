- What? - Give me my wallet, Jonas. In the glove compartment. Thanks. Can you stop with that thing? You'll ruin your eyes. I'll just be a minute. Right there. I know! Fuck it! Not now! Don't do this to me! Come on! Fuck! OPEN up, Jonas! Why are you doing this? Why? He's coming! Open! Dammit, Jonas! Open up! Open up. Why is it locked? What is it? I was there. I could see you. Hey, son. What's wrong? Tell me. What happened, Jonas? Calm down, son. Nothing will happen to you. You know that. You're safe here. Come on, calm down. Nothing bad will happen now. You hear? It'll all be fine. It'll be fine. BOYS We'll leave soon. For where? It's still bleeding a ton. Hold on. My name is Caroline Rivasseau. Ring a bell? From 8th and 9th grade? It's normal. We've changed a lot. You even more. I didn't recognize you. When I saw â€œJonas Cassetti" on your ID, it came back. I really don't look familiar? Remember you wouldn't sit next to me? That you can't forget. I was really sad when you left school. It was my parents. They thought it was best. To protect you. I'd have done the same for my kids. - You have kids? - Two. I'll show you. Look. This is Charlie... and this is Maxime. Good-looking kids. Otherwise... I guess you get asked a lot... Did they find... No. Let's get going. So you went to the same school? Were you a troublemaker back then? Lay off him. There's no one nicer. You thirsty? Caroline isn't here? She's out patrolling. I'm in charge of your case. You want something to drink? You've caused trouble at Boys before. Is that true? Is it? This time it's not my fault. I heard differently. But I'll hear your side too. Should I go on? Are you really interested? Get the fuck off me! Motherfucker! You bit his arm? It's nothing. The guy is this thick. Except he's pressing charges. You don't care? I don't know why I go back to that shithole. That's settled. It's off-limits to you now. Can I go home? Nothing lei': to say? Yes, you're free to go. This is Samuel. I can't answer. Leave a message. Sam? Sam, open up. Don't be such a pain. Fun Radio.. is my radio! And we're off to another school year. Not cool. Teachers, homework, pushy parents. Back to school really sucks. But Fun Radio is here with you. So rise and shine with No Doubt's Don't Speak. Have a nice... Photographers tatting Lady Di's Mercedes... They'll blame the paparazzi, you'll see. Well, she is dead. Next they'll say the paparazzi got her driver drunk. The accident was caused by lots of things. You okay, honey? Are you ready? - Orange juice? - No, I'm good. Chin up. We'll leave in 5 minutes. It hurts when you scratch, dumb dog. - Don't say that. - It's just a dog. Come on, Fripou. Come. I love you, handsome. Mr. Cassetti! Get moving... and smile. Jonas, here. - How's it going? - Fine. Great T-shirt. Thanks. How was your summer? We went to the mountains. Pretty boring. How about yours? Well, summer vacation this year... with my mom... What about her? She died. What? I told you she was sick. I didn't know... I'm so sorry. I told you at the school party. You don't remember? Wait... Why didn't you call? I don't have your number. Your parents are unlisted. I hope we're together this year. - How so? - In the same class. That would be cool. No news from Nico? No. You got in a fight? Quiet, please. I have 10th grade after you. Hello, everyone. I welcome you all and wish you a good year. 9th grade is important, your launch pad to high school, to choices, career paths, encounters... - May I sit? - Hello, young man. There's a nice seat here in front of me. Hurry up, please. Take your seat. Sit down! Thank you. I was just explaining how essential 9th grade is. This seat is taken. Can I sit here? Excuse me. Sorry, that's my seat. Are you deaf or what? You decide. - Not me. - Tell him to beat it. Okay, go fuck yourself. Hello, Jonas. I'm Nathan. It means I'm a gift, in Hebrew. Okay... that's cool. Summer vacation is over. Quiet, please. And here we go... Assemat. Here. - Belgrade. - Here. - Cassetti. - Here. - Dewatter. - Here. This morning, 3 people joined him. Martin Buckley is patient. This is his tribute to Diana. She lost her life. I'm only losing a few days. Want some more mashed potatoes? Yes, I would. So how was school? You're awfully quiet. Not that much happened. Nothing to say? How is your class? Any friends in it? Some. All those idiots with flowers. They won't bring her back. It's true. I hate to be a pain, but you should call Nicolas. Ask how school went for him. He can call me too. Time to stop sobbing. She wasn't your sister. Sweetie? Can we turn off the TV? Come on... it's only a few minutes long. Something did happen. - New kid in class. - Really? He seems cool. Does he seem cool or uncool? What's his name? Nathan. Did you two speak? New kids have it tough. Yes, we spoke. He sits next to me. He got left back. He offered to help me. If I have any questions. That's great. Yeah, it's cool. There's something else. He has a scar. It goes from here... to here. What's it from? No idea. Watch out, Jonas. Watch out for what? Just watch out, that's all. Jonas, wake up. Time to wake up! Wake up, lazy bones. Why didn't you let me in? - Are you serious? - What? - I was at work. - Yeah, right. They hit you at work? Excuse me. Does it hurt, babe? - I'm thirsty. - Wait. Don't move. - Don't move. - Thanks. - Are you sick? - I've had it. You and your sleazy Grindr hookups. - Get lost. - Samuel... Shut up! Just shut up. I'm not asking you to change. I don't care. I'm asking you to leave. I took your keys. You're history. Get your stuff. I'll leave the rest at the hospital. - I'm talking to you! - I hear. I won't see you again. Total waste-case. Another mass shooting, this time in Louisiana. A man opened fire in a movie theater, killing 2 and wounding 7 before taking his own life... Why are you here? It's your day off. Are you sure? - Another fight? - Don't worry. Henri, look who it is. I told Henri you'd come by. Sleep well, Henri? Fair. What a nice boy! What happened to you? Nothing, just a bad punch at boxing. Any plans for today? I'll just hang around. I'll read a little. - It may be a while. - I know... Ready, Henri? Showtime? Go on, honey. See you later. Nothing to say? I love you. The sooner we go, the sooner we're back. See you later. Come on, Henri, why the hangdog look? If things go badly, - I want you to tell her. - What? Out of the question! That's not my job. I'm not negotiating. This is my third operation. I won't make it. Why are you saying that? No one's dying. I was like you before. Handsome, big, ball-buster. More muscles, but... You don't know it yet... getting old really sucks. I do know it. You don't like it? Too greasy. Come on, have a fry. Relax, your husband is a Terminator. Any news? Is it about Henri? No, it's... my mother. Bad news, 10. His head stopped... We're looking for his wife. I'm sorry. - Es Nathan. - 5th floor, right. - Sorry, I wanted... - Stop. It's me. What? What the fuck is this bullshit? Wait! You wait. See this guy here? I came to fuck him. You're not into me? Not even a little? What's your problem? Why do you humiliate yourself? It works sometimes. Some guys hit me. Others stay. - I won't hit you. - Cool. You know what? You're sexier in real life. Great. Come in? What did you do? What? - An ugly cowlick. - Stop it. - You used too much gel. - Leave it. It's all sticky and gross. Nathan, stop, please. You're hot now. The battle was waged from July 1942 to February 1943. So it lasted... seven months. In 1939, Hitler and Stalin signed a non-aggression pact. Nevertheless, in 1941, Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa in the USSR. His goal: eliminate Slavs and Communists. No one move. Nathan! Can you hear me? - Where am I? - In History class. The non-aggression pact, remember? Yeah, that rings a bell. You okay? Sometimes my blood pressure drops. Can I go to the infirmary? Of course. - Jonas, can you come? - Take him. In case it happens again. Are you okay? We're free! - Now what do we do? - Come. Oh yeah... you're good. Do you mind if I talk? Where were you before? St. Cyprien. With the priests? So? Why did you leave? You got expelled? - You won't say? - Listen, it's complicated. What are you staring at? Nathan! Can you keep a secret? Because I don't want any trouble. Say it. Yeah, I can keep a secret. Anyway, if you talk... Ever hear about how priests rape kids? That's it. It started in 4th grade. Not exactly. It started as little games. Cuddles, caresses. I didn't really realize. But last year, we were in the school chapel. And then, he made me blow him. All of a sudden. He grabbed my head, shoved me on my knees, and put his old dick in my mouth. Want the rest? I bit him... as hard as I could. He shouted: "Son of a bitch, I'll kill you!" I wouldn't let go, like a dog with a bone. He took the chalice from the altar... He did this. Nasty Story, huh? Didn't your parents call the cops? Sure, what do you think? There will be a trial. In fact, you can come if you want. Want to? Fuck! Come on, keep quiet. Anyone here? How long till the bell? No idea. 5 minutes maybe. You can't smoke here. - Want one? - I don't smoke. - You're not used to this. - To what? Skipping classes, smoking in the gym. Why don't you have friends? In 3 weeks, you've spoken to no one. Not true. I have friends. I speak to people. Liar. I do. Last year I had a friend. His parents divorced. His dad stayed, his mom left... Make it short. His name? - Who? - Your best friend. Nicolas, but we fell out. You got upset that he preferred his mom to you? Not to me. - To his dad. - To you. You were in love. Stop it. You were in love. Now you're pissed, because he dumped you. Don't make that face. It's cool to like guys. I mean it. Smoke. It'll relax you. One puff. What'll it do? Shit. I feel dizzy. Come. What the hell? It's me, Mr. Badet. It's Jonas. Jonas? Jesus... I thought it was some thug. You know where my parents are? They left a few days ago. I don't know where to. What's that? Another fight? Don't say I came by. They'll worry and I don't want them to. If you say keep quiet, I keep quiet. Still got your motorcycle? Good... I always wanted one. I'll see if there's a spare key. If you need anything... Thanks. Goodnight. Fuck! Hello, sir. Can I help you? I'd like to get a room. Sure... For how many nights? One for now. With or without a seaside view? What's the difference? Not much. I don't know your tastes. With. With a view. Fine. Can I have a credit card? Thank you. Jonas Cassetti... Your name sounds familiar. Have we met? Or else... I don't know, maybe... - Your nose is bleeding. - What? A bloody nose. It happens a lot, sorry. Is the room expensive? 140 a night, 160 with breakfast. Jesus... I guess you'll skip breakfast. What's going on? Answer me! What's going on? I'll come in. I'm warning you. Can I have a puff? Easy does it, Gainsbourg. So, what did your parents say? Okay? They're thinking it over. Meaning? My mom wants to talk to yours. What's up, faggots? What do you want? A smoke. What the hell? How long does it take, a year? Don't worry. How about a movie Saturday? No, don't worry. We can drop him off. I wrote it down, in case we need to join him. No... thank you! It's really nice. Yes, goodnight to you too. Nathan's mother is very nice. So it's settled? It's okay? - So it's okay? - Yep. - I'm so happy. - Me too. What's up, guys? My buddy and I were wondering. How do you fuck? He must have a small dick. I'm sure you do. So I was wondering how it worked. Come on, give me a smoke. Every day now? Is that a problem? What? Stop looking at me like that! You got your smoke, now beat it. Who the hell do you think you are? You're nothing! Piece of shit. You beat it, fag! - Stop... - Beat it! I should beat it? Watch your tone. And stop staring, dickwad! Goddamn fucking faggots... Look how Jo-Jo eyeballs him. You're a real sicko. A real sicko, dude. Want to see my cock? Is that it? Hurry up, guys! Everyone in the gym now! Everyone, get ready to warm up. Wake up! Stop walking on the mats, thanks! We'll start with a little warm-up. Sir! You okay? Are you in pain? Let me help. Lie down. Come with me. Yuck. Come and lie down. Go get the nurse. He's shitting himself! Everyone, out! Into the hallway! Get out! Go away! Think he'll still bum cigarettes? What did you put in it? You're crazy! He won't die? Get real. Good job. Go away! I found this in the kitchen. What is it? What were you doing? Not committing suicide, I hope. Nope. We get lots of nut-jobs here. I just had a smoke. What planet are you from? There's no smoking. Nowhere. You didn't know? Damn! It's no good? Yeah, it's good. But strong. Try it. Here's to you. It's fine. You're a bit frail. So what do you do? Hospital porter. What's that? I wheel sick people in hospitals. Oh yeah, not cool. Like it? Not really. - I hate my job too. - Really? It's not bad here. Pretty calm. - Peaceful. - No, boring. I'm like a flunky. You just started, wait and see. How do you know that? I don't know, it's obvious. It's a summer job. Have we met? You're weird. You're hiding something. Let's look in here. What the hell? I'm checking for weapons or a knife. Find it funny? What if I come back and everyone's dead? What's this? Gameboy. Does it still work? Can I try? Leg? What the fuck? Did the alarm go off? But thanks to me, it's under control. Thanks to you? It's my fault. I smoked in my room. Who's this? A customer. Excuse me, sir. Now that you're here, I'll go. Give me a minute. I'll leave you with that psycho. I'm off. Night, Gameboy. If you want to smoke, go outside. It's better. Gameboy, one last thing. I'm meeting my girl and some pals. If you want to come for a drink, rather that cutting your wrists, feel free. Can I put on some music? You mind? Go ahead. ...discreet singer MylÃ©ne Farmer, in an exclusive interview... No, I like that. I look for you Among crowds in cities by the sea Among anonymous passersby It took time Not bad. Who is it? Can you make it louder? Can we be insouciant When we're no longer innocent Oh, Atlas I broke the ice All these happy skies That I'd never seen before I wait for you on the edge Between the light and the void Fuck. You okay? Sleep well? What time is it? Late. It's late. Anyway, I have to get going. Excuse me. Later, baby. Going out? - Where to? - Somewhere. Hurry back from somewhere. It's Gameboy! Sleep well? Yeah, you had a nice beddy-bye. You look like shit. Jonas, isn't this house gorgeous? There's even a pool. You really want nothing? Coffee? Soft drink? No, thanks. Next time for sure. My husband and I are going to the mall. The mall, on a Saturday? It'll be packed. We both work during the week. Of course. Sorry'!- Jonas didn't say you were pregnant. Sure you don't mind? My husband is abroad. I like the company. Will he be back soon? In three weeks. Just in time to see him born. So it's a little boy. A little Leonard. Unless we change again. I think he'll be coming early. Come on out early! I want to see you. I want to see you, Leo! Stop, Nathan. I'm happy to meet you. It's just the beginning. Our sons adore each other. You're very cool about it. About what? No, nothing. I'm just talking... I'll be going... See you tomorrow. Behave. Tomorrow night. I put antihistamines in his bag, for his allergies. We'll give him back in one piece. So have fun. Bring a swim suit? Want to swim? It's so fast. I wonder how do you do it. You need to get the knack. Want to try? I'd rather watch you. No, you W- It's easy. It's like a puzzle. Makes lines with the ones that fall. Hit that to rotate. Hit that to move. Where do I put it? There. Spin that one around. Like that. Now that you got it, the idea is never to stop. Never. See? You're good too. We're ready. Great, let's go. - What are you seeing? - Nowhere. Not too much sex? It's Gregg Araki. Are you okay with it? Nathan's taste is strange. I want to see it too. You're old enough. I won't decide for you. Take the cell phone? You have a cell phone? Cool! Only for emergencies. It's not a game. Weird noise. When will Dad get a tune-up? I'll pick you up at the usual spot? What are you doing? Just one. Here. Thanks. Don't tell Dad. Not a word. Dummy. The smoke isn't bothering you? Actually, can I have one too? Your mom knows you smoke? No, she doesn't. It'll be our little secret. Are those lights Magic World? Yep. Have you ever been? Your parents never took you? They're not into rides. And the crowds... It's amazing. - Your parents are dumb. - Nathan! Sorry, Jonas. I promise I'll take you. Don't get disfigured too. - Mom! - What? He doesn't know about your blast-off? Mom, stop. When he was 9, we took him to Magic World. He wanted to ride the bumper cars, but not just once, more like 15 or 20 times. You know how he likes to ram into people. But there was a group of guys. They all went after him. Stop, Mom! Nathan didn't give a fuck. They hit him so hard, he got ejected. When I say ejected, I mean like a missile! Slammed into the protection barrier. And barn! His cheek sliced in two. You're such a pain. I love your scar, honey. It gives you character. Jonas won't disagree. Right, Jonas? No. Cat got your tongue, Gameboy? Can you drive me back? Why? Isn't it nice here? I brought you here. You were totally plastered. I could have left you there like a barfly. Ingrate. Careful with my Gameboy. My Gameboy! Your Gameboy? Sorry'!- Accident. You okay? Mom, Jonas... Jonas, Mom. I think you've met. You okay? You're quiet since we got here. I'm good. Did you believe that priest crap? Yes. It was so over-the-top. You're wrong. Are you upset? No. Good. I'd have been sad if you were. We can't play now. Take it. It's for you. A gift. That's ridiculous. It's expensive. Makes me happy. You're crazy. Thanks. It's wild how you've changed. Your face, your hair, everything. What's that? Tattoos I did. By yourself? And your eye? Got in a fight. You get in fights now? Did you do that? You crazy? You're capable of it. It was at Boys. At Boys... Where do you live? Downtown still. And your parents? Same. They haven't budged. Like us. And your husband? He couldn't stand being with us. So he vanished. Like you. Been stalking me for long? - I'm not. - Liar! The hotel was by chance? The beach too? Gotcha, asshole! Leo... Also at the bowling alley, and the movies. Can you explain? I needed to see him. Now you see me. Have a good look. Come on, Gameboy. Tell her what you said last night. What? Isn't that why you're here? You came here, so now talk. You got in my car, came back here. It's been 17 years. 18. It's been 18 years, Jonas. What a weird ending. But cool. Did you like it? Something wrong? Just a message. Who is it? Listen. It's me, honey. My water just broke. I called the clinic. Don't worry. Jonas' mother isn't answering, so give her a call. Take a taxi and meet me at the clinic. Can you believe it? Your little brother is coming. It's amazing. I'll ask my mom to pick us up. No. I have a better idea. Stop it. - We won't get in. - Why not? We're too young. You can be such a wimp! What's up, kids? We want to go in. No minors allowed. - I'm 18. - Yeah, right. How about him? My boyfriend. 18 too. So? Get lost! We'll all get in trouble. - Come on. - Get lost! What an asshole! Hear how talked to me? Forget it. Let's go. I'll call my mom. I want to go inside. Take it easy. What? Better wait a few more years. Can you help us get in? Don't rush it, trust me. You'll find it sad and ugly. We don't care. You know La Dolce Vita? I can get you in. Really? I can even drive you. - No, we're good. - Wait. Is it far? Ten, fifteen minutes. Let's go. Cool. Nathan! Where are you going? What? They don't want us here. Stop being scared all the time. You're safe with me. Don't go away If you love her, don't go away Daddy, if you love her, tell her That she's the love of your life, life, life - Much longer? - We're almost there. Can I lower the music? - You don't like it? - Not really. You're crazy! It's beautiful. Don't go off into the night The night that scares me The night that never ends Like a thief, he left without me We'll never go to the movies again Where are we? Relax, we're almost there. You keep saying that. You're like that? Can we turn around? What a funny little scar. - Cute. - Hands off! Look! Turn around! Relax, it'll all be fine. Shut up! Fuck! Stop sobbing! He's breathing. Stay put! Stay put, little prick! Help! Nathan! My brother seemed cool. Just one thing I don't get. Why didn't you say it? I don't know. I couldn't. I was ashamed. Ashamed of what? You were 15! Is it possible he's still alive? What do you want me to say? Of course he's alive. Can I have a cigarette? He wouldn't like to see you so sad. I'll leave you. Can you drive him back? Where to? He's homeless. My boyfriend kicked me out. Why? I cheated on him. A lot? Yeah, a lot. Way too much. Why? I don't know. I'm looking for something that doesn't exist. I'll get my stuff. Thank you. Where to? Drop me at the hospital. I can sleep in the staff lounge. - What about after? - No idea. I'll find something. I didn't speak earlier because... I don't agree with my mom. I think Nathan is dead. Or we'd have found him. Yeah, he's dead. If you hadn't abandoned him, you'd be dead too. Help. This can't be happening. Did you see this man at the cinema? No. And he left Boys when you tried to go in? Yeah, I think so. You're not sure? I remember him in the street. Did either you or Nathan know that La Dolce Vita didn't exist? No. You're sure Nathan didn't know this man? What? Stop with your questions. Just one more. Can you confirm that after hitting Nathan, he made you leave the car? Yeah. Why? Why do you ask? Why did he make you leave? Understand why I'm asking all this? To have a chance of finding him. Try to recall. I know it's hard. It can help us, Jonas. 6 days and still no trace of Nathan Dewatter, 16 years old, missing since Saturday. The teen spent the evening with a friend before being abducted by a man now wanted by the police. People say they've seen the boy, but investigators treat their claims with caution. The search continues and his parents... Dad... It'll all be fine. You know... maybe not now, but I think it'd be good... if we met soon to discuss this calmly. Peacefully, in other circumstances. I don't know. We'll see. You can friend me on Facebook. LEO D, capitals, period at the end. I'm so dumb. You must know it, since you spy on me. Can we make a little detour? It won't take long. What now? Just trust me. You really can. No way will I go in there. One hour, just an hour. You've already been? - Nope. - Me neither. Let's go. Seriously?
