- Okay, one minute. Lockdown, all clear. It's the bear, let's get him. Hit the fence. - Youch that hurt. A little electricity won't phase me. I think I singed my bear suit. I gotta put a stop to this stuff. Nobody's gonna trash my park. They call me Weewankah Willie, named after the park. Ah, this'll do the trick. Before Mr. B. Morris Rancewell got here, this was a wonderful place. A place where you could kick back, relax and enjoy nature. But he's ruining everything. Ripping up the land with that factory of his. I know there's something else going on there. And when I find out what it is, I'm gonna blow the lid off his entire operation. Mm, I'm gonna stop Rancewell and I'm gonna save Weewankah Park. * Ah * Oh yeah * State Park * Oh oh oh * State Park * Oh * Ah * Ha ha ha ha * State Park * Ah - Driving straight through LA Louis might not have been a great idea. - You're doing great, Johnny boy, only 48 hours to go. We're going to blow the skylights out of the Hollywood Bowl, man. - So linnie, was Eddie upset about this trip? - No, he told me to have a good time. It'll be the longest we've ever been apart. - Ahhhh. - Linnie, you should take advantage of your freedom from Eddie this week, especially after the way he went out on you. - Give me a break. That was in the 8th grade. - So. - Besides, we're definitely getting married. - Mm-hmm. - That was old news. Come on, you guys have been going to get married since we were at Junior High. - No, it's official. We picked out the rings and everything. I'm quitting school and going with him when he goes back to college this fall. - Freak me out, you're kidding? - Well, there's a lot more to this world than just books and homework, Marsha. There's fascinating people, exotic places and real life experiences. - Yo, Rocket. Am I keeping you awake? - Oh man, you drive. I've got to get some sleep. - Don't worry about a thing, my man. I know a place where we can crash. Weewankah Park. Less than an hour away on I-75. They've got showers, RV hookups, swimming, boating, fishing, water skiing. We can camp out just like the pioneers, man. - Don't worry, Eve. We're the three musketeers, remember? We'll help you get ready for that race. - I've gotta win or else all my plans for school, my entire future, goes right down the toilet. I can't believe this could happen to me. - It's happening all over. I mean, things aren't so great at my place either. We weren't able to get new cars this year and I bet I get hardly any really good clothes for school. - She's right, you know, Eve. Bankruptcy's no big deal anymore. My dad's best friend went bankrupt. - I thought he went to jail and committed suicide. - That was much later. - Dammit, Louis. What arr you doing? - Attention Weewankah campers, four more days until the wilderness challenge race. Anyone interested in participating, pick up an entrance form at the front gate. - What is going on down there? It's just like an East German water check. - What's this? - An old beer can, Sir, probably been in there for months. - Pat him down, McDermott. You know what the penalty is for open container, boy? You see that sign? - Welcome to Weewankah Park. No skateboards. No roller skates. - No alcoholic beverages, smart mouth. - Those guys are so cute. - We run a clean park here. Now, I'm going to give you two the chance to get the hell out or I bring you downtown and I book you on a 501. - Oh no, they're getting kicked out. - Rules are rules, son. You shouldn't have tried to smuggle it past me the way you did. You're a disgrace to your uniform. - Excuse me, Sir. What's the holdup? - Pardon? What kind of a smart ass question is that? - Well I just-- - I know your type. You probably have a car that has a bumper sticker that says, question authority. - How does that guy rate? - That guy just happens to be the sponsor of the Weewankah Wilderness Place... Race! Take over. - Come on, McDermott, let's clean up this mess. - Down the lake there, cut down those trees, level that mountain up there, pour the concrete. So you see why I had to get the parks concession rights, Bob. This place is totally inadequate for my needs. Excuse me, son, but you should be packing not restocking. Didn't you get the notice? - I must've missed it. - I don't see how. Several were sent. You've got to be out of here by tomorrow. - No! I don't think I can do that. You may have to send me another notice, maybe even a court order. - So that's how it is. When escrow closes on your land, and it will, I had planned to lease it back to you for awhile, but now, if I were you, I'd get a tent and start looking for a nice permanent campsite. Get packing, kid. - Don't look now, but it's Mr. Rocky Horror Show in person. - I don't know, Marsha, if he did something with his hair, he'd be kinda cute. - He's a heavy metaler. He's a disgusting low-life. - Yo, Rocket. If you're gonna work on a new costume, stay in the truck. Yo, Rocket. Was it something I said? - See what I mean about heavy metalers? Violence is so pass√©. - Hello. - Hi. - Does anyone need entry forms for the Wilderness Challenge? - Yes. - Enjoy your stay, ladies. - I know it's unorthodox, Olive. My mind's made up. This sort of behavior is unacceptable. And I intend to stop it. - You're offering a reward for the capture of Weewankah Willie? - This perpetrator did not only desecrate our parks proud symbol of conservation, but destroyed Mr. Rancewell's property. And after all he's done for Weewankah. - Thank you, Carl. - This morning's incident will put Mr. Rancewell's construction behind a whole day. If they don't lay in the foundation before the weather changes, the whole project will be thrown right off schedule. - Thank you, Carl. Now Olive, in the past we've had our differences. But stopping vandalism is something we can agree on. - The department has already told me to cooperate with you. But there's very little we'll ever agree on. Selling wilderness land to people like you may or may not help the national debt, but really, Mr. Rancewwell, a pesticide plant right next to the park grounds? - This factory is ecologically designed to blend in with the areas wilderness. That's the beauty of it, Olive. Nature and industry, working together. * Go Rockin Robin cause we're really * * Gonna rock tonight * Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee * * Every little bird in the tall oak tree * - Yo, Rocket! You still sleepin'? - Yes! - You outta check this out. Your loss. - Come on you guys. This is a great campsite. It's not nearly so crowded. - There's a reason for that, Marsha. - Superb spot, Coslow. Nothing like the smell of the great outdoors. - Well at least we won't have far to go. - I'll be right back, I promised Eddie I'd call as soon as we got here. - Old people. Weird, man. Fire. Wilderness Challenge Race. 5,000 bucks. - No, it doesn't work like that. Have to keep taking them whether you're doing it or not. My boyfriend doesn't understand about birth control pills. I know, Eddie. It'll be great. While you're taking your classes, I'll be in beauty school. And we'll be together forever and ever-- - Hi Brian. - And ever. - Hello again. - Nature and industry working together. That's swell. - You better believe it, Ranger. - Boy this really burns me up. Who coulda done this? - Environmentalists. I've had trouble with them before. - Like those earth guardians tried to firebomb your other pesticide plant. - They're all the same. Too bad I'm only allowed to exterminate insects. - Hey! Who did this? You earth guardians think freedom of speech gives you the right to trample the rights of others. Well it won't work with me. Got it? I want you outta here now. - You're kicking us out? Why? - Let's just say you're trying to camp in an unauthorized area. - But we have reservations. - Pick up your gear, get out! I don't want to see you or your kind in this park again. - What is that guys problem? - I know a place you can camp. - I've done all I can to keep out the radical elements, Sir? - If you still want to be chief of security for Rancewell Industries, you're gonna have to do more than that, Smite. - Trailor, where are you taking us? - This is Honeycutt property. My brother, Truckie and I own it. - Are you sure this'll be safe? - Oh, well I can come back later and check on you. - No, really, it's fine. We can manage, but thank you for everything. Oh, listen, you know, I'm going to go check for some firewood, okay? - See ya later. This is going to be so fun. I feel just like the Wilderness Family. - Wait till he comes out the door. He comes out the door, that's when you start shootin'. - I'll be, I got him. - Oh wait a minute. I got two of them, you will have none. Now you've got to finally come out the door. Play fair. - I know, I know. - How do you feel, John? Did you get some rest? - I feel fine, Louis. - You're absolutely amazing, man. You ran what, at least 20 miles, right? You jump off a moving truck, run off the road, through woods, up hills, in streams, over rocks and who knows what else, in less than two hours. With plenty of energy left to beat the living shit outta me. Incredible. - Why are you grinning at me like that for, Louis? - I gpt one word for you, man, The Wilderness Challenge. The winner gets five grand, man. Know what that'll buy? - Amplifiers? - Power. We could get a stack of Marshall's that'll blow the skylights outta the Hollywood Bowl, man. - Look, we have to get to LA. If you wanna super group, we gotta find the rest of the super group. - You need top notch equipment to get top notch players, man. If you'd win this money, we'd have the wattage to get someone like... Ted Nugent to jam with us, man. - I'm starving. Can we put on the hot dogs and hamburgers? - Yes, the rest of the food's in the ice chest. - Ice chest? - Oh shit. - What do we have left? - Well the potatoes will be enough. I love baked potatoes. - Now I'm going to cook you a big juicy steak. Get some protein on those bones. - What the hell's that? - Moose, deer, I don't think they knew for sure. These hunters were running out of the woods and they just gave it to me, man. Sometimes people can be so damn wonderful. - Now, the outside may be just a tad burnt, but that's normal. Just peel that part off. - Who wants chives? - Mine's a rock. - Too well done? - No, no, mines a real rock. My potato must still be in there someplace. - I can't see what I'm eating. Are your chives kinda furry? - Gonna need a lot of fire to fry this sucker. - Louis. - Best vitamins you can get. - Louis. - Come from wild game. - I'm not going to eat that. - Fire, fire. Hurry. - I'm Tallahassee Ray. This is my wife, Ethel. - Pleased to meet ya, honey. - What a great effect, man. We could use that in our stage show, Rocket. - Every night I get into this bear suit and sneak around that construction site. Trying to find proof that Rancewell is up to something. And I try and leave him a little present. Just to remind him that I'm always watching. Maybe this skunk catcher will slow them down. One day I'll find the proof I need. Rancewell's not going to take my land. And he'll never finish that factory. - Shhh. - What, I have to get this blown up. - Shhh. Do the blowjob later. There's something out there. Oh, my God. It moved. Did you see it? - It's just a tree. - Then what was that sound? - It was just... The wind. I'm going to sleep. Way to go gang. We just killed Marsha's eel-skinned belt. - Weewankah Willie has a great ass. - Mm, the perpetrator was wearing fake bear feet. - Smite, come to the construction site right away. - Ranger Smite will have this taken care of in no time, Mr. Rancewell. - What can I do for you, Sir? - Get rid of these, now! - Have a good day, Carl. - Hey Carl. Maybe a bath in tomato juice will help take care of the smell. - And so the Wilderness Challenge is divided into three main sections: Swimming, kayaking, and the orienteering force. Now we have classes for each leg of the race to help you improve your skills in any or all of these areas. So after you finish registering, you can sign up for the classes, with the ranger at the appropriate desk, okay? Thank you very much. - Okay, Dick Smith and Jane Doe. I guess you're all set. - Excuse me. - Hey dudes, didn't I see you two on that TV show, USA Pro Sports Roundup? You know, if you hadn't been disqualified for-- - You have never seen us before. - Okay, Eve. You're registered. Did you want to take any classes? - Yeah, the only one I really need is orienteering. I don't know anything about it. - I'm sorry, those classes are full. - Me too, Eddie. I'm gettin' worked up just thinking about it. It turns me on. I can't help it. It happens every time I give you a haircut. Something about it just gets me so hot. - Well I guess you might as well forget about the scholarship, huh? - Trailor, what do you think? Is there anybody... - Mm, of course I did. - Trailor. - Sorry. - Have you heard anything I've said? - Sure, you need somebody to teach you orienteering. - Well? - Well... I know someone who could do it. - Yeah? - Yeah. My brother, Truckie. He's the beat there is. - Hi. Do you need some help there? - No thanks. - You sure? I'm really good at mechanical things. I'm the only one at my house that can fix a jacuzzi filter. - Could you hand me that crescent wrench? - You know, I believe we should all help one another whenever we can, don't you? It's the spirit of the 80s. - The crescent wrench. - My name is Eve, what's yours? - Truckie. - Oh, that's a cute nickname. Did you get it playing sports? - Nope, it's my real name. When I was born my mom said she got bigger than a Mack truck. - Oh here, look, let me do that. I find this so rewarding. Ow. - Look, I can't teach you orienteering this week. I'm too busy. I overheard you talking to my brother. - Why did you let me go through all that? - Well it's in the spirit of the 80s. I didn't want to deprive you of the rewards of helping me. - How thoughtful. - Please don't do that again. I told you not to do that again. - Wah! - What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't do that. Don't you dare. Help, put me down. Put me down! - Yes, ma'am. - No! - Take it easy, Eve. You should be out swimming anyway. Start gettin' in shape for your big race. - Who do you think you are? I know that ass. Speaking of rewards. If you don't teach me what I need to know, I just may collect the one on you, Willie. - Come on, Linnie. You can't get married. You don't buy the first dress you try on. You've got to shop around. - All right, I admit, I wondered about other guys. - See? - But I'm having a good time just appreciating... Nature. - You've been out of action too long. Look, shoulders back, tummy in. I'll show you how it's done. Follow me. * Oh * Ha ha ha ha * Oh oh oh Nice boat. - Thanks. - We were wondering what it's like on the other side of the lake. - It's pretty much the same as here except there's more trees. - I can't believe it. If they were any dumber... You'd have to water them. - Hope to see you around. - One word, just one word. - I bet we could get those girls to go on a boat ride with us sometime. You know what I mean? - You know it, dude. - In orienteering you make your way through the wilderness using a map and a compass to find checkpoints marked by flags like these. Now, at each flag is a coded punch which you use to punch your control card. Now there's six checkpoints in The Wilderness Challenge and you have to find them in the order indicated. - Okay. - Now did you study the section under map reading? - Not yet. - Come on, how are you going to know what I'm talking about? Orienteering's a thinking sport. You have to use your mind as well as your body. - I use both quite well, thank you. I was the best on my swim team at the 200 meter freestyle and only one girl ever beat me and that's because she cheated. - Oh but of course you would never do anything like that, would you? - No, I wouldn't. - Well I'm glad to know I'm being blackmailed by a real straight shooter. * Like some information * What is there to do * I remember reading it on the line * * How you work from bed to noon * * And you don't need to tell * Of how you make your mark * I don't really wanna know how much * * Just wanna know what for * Could you wait on a dime my dear * * But don't do it lying down * What do you put on a resume * If you never had to leave this town * * And what is your position * In his company * What are your fringe benefits * * And can you say that perfectly * * You know you're disappointing * * Hope I am wrong * But you not the same person * That I knew so well * That I used to know * Will you wait on a dime my dear * * But don't do it lying down * What do you put on a resume * If you never had to leave this town * - Nice stroke. - Pardon? - Your stroke, you're a good swimmer. - Thanks. And a nice bathing suit. - Shoot, this old faded thing. I've had it for weeks. - Hi. Like some lemonade? It's so hot today. - That's really sweet of you, Trailor. Thank you. Mm, it's good. - I was wondering if maybe you'd like to come to a party I'm having tonight. It's sort of a promotional thing I'm putting on for the race this week and I was just... - Truckie. I swear when this is all over I'll find some way to make it up to you, okay? Ow! - Next time why don't you just try wearing some clothes to cover up your arms and legs, all right? - I know you think I'm some dumb yuppie who's gotten anything she's ever wanted, right? Some bimbo who hasn't had to work hard for anything in her life. Well I'm going to tell you something. Recently my whole world practically fell apart. My parents just went bankrupt. - Your parents went bankrupt and you flip out? - Don't you understand, I needed this scholarship to get into college. My parents can't afford it. - My parents aren't around anymore. And Trailor works his butt off to save for college. Now let's see if we can get the rest of the way through this sample course without having another breakdown, all right? Come on, Eve, let's go. - Have you seen this? It's a great blue herring. It's a huge bird. It's wings make a noise when it flies. Here's a picture of it. Look at its feet. It holds onto branches that way. - You know, I know a little bit about birds myself. From here I can see a long-legged goat sucker. - Oh look, Linnie. A big red Cockaded. - You know, Raymond, you should let me give you a haircut. The sides are a little long. - Okay. - Okay. - Yes, whew! - Not bad. Think we outta knock off till tomorrow though. - Oh, feeling a tad humiliated about to move me down now, huh? Come on, come on. Let's do it again. - Hey. I'm serious. You outta take it easy. This is the first day. - Wait a minute, who's calling the shots here, huh, huh, what's the matter coach? Does it annoy you to see me , tearing up the woods and ripping up your name, huh? - Okay, boss. Do it again. * Whenever life can be tough * And it starts to get me down * I stop and think about her touch * * And it brings me back around * You see, I'm just a simple man * * You know, I love the simple life * * I live to do the things that I can * * And I'm my best when she's on my side * * I need her heart closer to mine * * I need her heart beating in time * * I need her heart * To ease me through the night * I like a lover in the night * And her moves can help me go * A little love and I'm all right * * She fills me full of hope - Thanks for helping me clock my swim time. And helping me out today. - It was fun. - What is this? - Japanese silk. You're not like anyone I ever hung out with. - You too. - Okay. We can quit now. Come on, it's starting to get dark. Dammit, Truckie. I found all your stupid little flags but one. Where are you? - Did I scare you? - Drop dead, I'm going home. - Ah. Don't move. - Am I about to be attacked by some wild animal or can you just not stand to see me go? - No, I got booby traps set all around here. - Oh, wait, I recognize this. This is where you stashed your bear costume. Okay, in that case, the campsites this way. Or is it that way? - You're the champion orienteer. Can't you find your way back to your own campsite? - Ha ha. God, I'm pooped, I just want to crawl into my sleeping bag and pass out. * We went in right through the window * * I got a gal, she's gotta move * * Now come on in now, you won't be alone * * For 10 dollars you feel right at home * * It's a power like you did the other night * * So I keep enough to pay * It's a night like any other - Hey, what do you want to drink? We've got Bud, Heiny, Falstaff, Light, Coors, some Coors Lite. - Eve, major party time. How do I look? Too much? It was either this or Anne Klein. - Eve, this is Rob. Rob's a Virgo. He's into computers and science fiction and entomology. He's been telling me all about the Northeastern spit bug. - Great, wait till you meet Johnny. You're gonna die. You're just gonna die. - Eve, we're gonna go look for Lampyridae with tourists. - I'm telling you, Eve, this is the real thing. Johnny's so cool. He's funny and smart and good-looking. Who invited them? - Who invited anybody? - Hey, there's a music box. - Heavy metalers shouldn't be allowed in the park. They're such... - Hi. I'm Johnny Rocker. - I'm Eve Murphy. I've heard a lot about you. - So, wanna dance? - I can't. I have a boyfriend. - Yeah, we're talking to Ted Nugent about playing for us. It's like I told him the other day when we were doing lunch, Nuge, babe, I hear you're looking to jam with the best. - We're goin'. - What are you talkin, we just got here. - We're goin'. - Hey, come back here tiger. - Help, help, please. Help me, somebody. Please. Help me. Help me, please, somebody. Help me, get me out of here. Please, somebody, help. Willie. Gee, thanks a lot, Willie, for saving me. Come on, don't walk away, please come back. Willie. Please. I've been waiting so long to see you. - Alcoholic beverages, illegal campfires, disturbing the peace, littering, we are talking about criminal charges here. After this mess gets cleaned up I'll escort you to the gate. - What? - Hey, let her go. - Damn it, Smite, you can't do this. - Oh yeah? Watch me. - Let her go, Carl. You're out of your jurisdiction, you're over the line. You're on Honeycutt property. - It won't be your property for long, Honeycutt. - You heard me, Smite, get off our land. - Don't forget, I'll be watching you, miss earth guardian. - That was really nice of you, Truckie. - Smite, Rancewell wants to see you right away. - This is gonna be a piece of cake, Rocket. You swim a little, you run a little. - This isn't gonna be like that time you booked us on that bar mitzvah circuit, is it, Luis? Or like that mailing scam? - Hey, the heavy metal chain letter was a great concept. - Because I'd rather play my music. - A couple hours a day, that's all I'm asking for. I'll tell you everything you need to know. Like this oriental hearing thing, you just grab these little flags as you run along. - Yoo hoo, morning. You boys want to join us for breakfast. - Come on over. We're just about to fire up the ol' microwave now. - No thanks. - What's your problem, Luis? - Old people scare the shit our of me, man. - The mail's here. - Hi, bro. Mail come? What did we get? - Nothing. What are you doing with that? - Got an official health notice to take it back. Too much red dye number two. - What? - Oh, Rancewell Foods, a division of Rancewell Pesticides, figures. - See you later, I'm gonna go watch the game. - Being able to identify nature's landmarks will come in handy for those of you in the Wilderness Challenge this week. Like this extremely rare parotas delphinium. - What's the hold up now? - The bear again, sir. - You, men, get back to work. I'll show you what work is, here. Hold my coat. Smite, you come out over here. From now on, I'm gonna double the security guards. And fire the guy on the gate last night. Clear off these weeds, we're losing time. - But, but sir, but-- - Never mind all these boxes. - Now, do you see the plant species rhus and rhus vernix. Otherwise known as poison ivy and poison oak. - Go, Rocket! - About the party. I really don't have a boyfriend. The truth is, I didn't know. - I told you I was a musician. - But you didn't tell me you were a heavy metaler. At our school, heavy metalers are considered to be the creeps, the lowlifes, the scumbags, the trash, the geeks-- - I get it, I get it. - I've never even talked to a heavy metaler before. - Will you stop putting that label on me? I'm a musician, I just don't play wimp music. - Okay, sorry. But you have to admit, you look really weird. - I look weird? - It's just all those chains and spikes and leather and stuff that make you look so ridiculous. No offense. - I happen to like what I wear, I think it's kind of neat. Peachy keen, in fact. It's my style, and it says something about me. - What? - That I like chains and spikes and leather and all that stuff. - You don't have to yell. I'm trying to apologize. - What about what you wear? - Me? This happens to be a $200 jogging suit. - Have you ever worn anything without someone else's name on it? - Everything has to have a name on it. Somebody had to make it. - You don't have to advertise. Sergio, Holsten, Camallis, Calvin, you're a walking billboard. - You're calling me a billboard? - Yeah. - What does that make you? - Gone. - Hi there. We've been noticing a glitch in the interface you did on the DDR30s. - Could you reverse the polarity on your amp there? Let's see here. - I think we got it. This'll cut down on the distortion without a DBX. It'll also make it louder. - Louder? - You can set up your drums at our place, it's soundproof. - That would be really swell, ma'am, sir. - Music's sort of a hobby of ours. - One time, Ray and I had our own little combo, didn't we, honey? - I told you not to overdo it yesterday. - What did you just put in your mouth? - Rag weed. Two words. And spices. So that's it. - Ow. It's hot. - Now hold it there, it'll draw out the pain. - What are you, some sort of Indian medicine man too? - No. My great-grandad was. - You know, after you left last night, I had quite a long talk with Trailor. You don't tell him everything, do you? - what do you mean? - Oh come on, Truckie, he's not stupid, he knows there's something going on with the lease on your place. Rancewell's trying to take your land too, isn't he? - And store, Rancewell Catering, a division of Rancewell Pesticides, is that a joke or what? Ever hear of the Kilgore creek incident? They could never prove it, but several years ago, Rancewell was accused of dumping toxic chemicals into a dried up creek bed. Thousands of barrels of chemicals covered over in a landfill operation, and then they built houses on it. - Wait a minute, was that the house in development where all those people started getting sick? - Yeah, like a lot of things around here lately. Wild life. You know, it's not just the new construction that I'm trying to stop. - So you think that Rancewell is trying to dump toxic waste right here in the park? - I know it. And If I can prove it, I'm gonna stop that son of a bitch. You got it, now push. - I feel like a beaver. - Oh yeah? - I'm talking about the dam we're building. - We're not building a dam, we're blocking culvert so the creek can follow its original path. - Where was that? - That way. Used to go right through Rancewell's construction site. - Ahh. - Uh-huh. that's right. Well, start digging. - Wait a minute, you want me to dig across this entire road? - That should be a piece of cake for someone who can fix a jacuzzi filter. Come here, hey. - Stop it. - Now how will I be able to defend myself. - You won't. - I love this job. - This has gone too far, I want this site protected by cop security day and night. Now you get some pups in here and pump that water out. I'm going to have this factory built before Winter, if I have to-- - I've got a duck, sir. - Smite, get out of my face. I'm gonna turn this Willie into one very dead bear rug. * It's more than a feeling * There's something about the way you smile * * You're making me laugh * I just want to be with you * I'd like to know you better * Because you'd be so easy to love * * Why don't we get together * You'd be so easy to love * You'd be so easy * You'd be so easy * You'd be so easy, easy to love * * It's more than emotion * Because I'm head over heels * And that's all right * You've got something special, baby * * And I gotta get you in my life * * I've got to know you better * Because you'd be so easy to love * * Why don't we get together * Because you'd be so easy to love * * You'd be so easy * You'd be so easy * You'd be so easy, easy to love * - What are we thinking of, dude? One of us has got to drive the boat. * You'd be so easy * You'd be so easy * You'd be so easy, easy to love * - She must have put them up to it. I'm telling you, Olive, this is the one who's been causing all the trouble around here. - You have shown me no proof of that. She stays in the park and in the race. You can go now, Carl. - What? - I'll handle this. That ski stunt was no accident, was it? - No, ma'am, it wasn't. - I don't put too much stock in Ranger Smite's Weewankah Willy theories, but I do wish you would stay off his bad side. Rancewell's takeover is a fact of life, Truckie, and there's nothing you can do about it. - Look, there's something I gotta do. - Me too. Hey, come on, I'll drive. - Right, come on, get off, this is between Rancewell and me. - Truckie, come on, let me help. There must be something I can do. - You know how to run a dozer? - I want the back of the site fenced in today. Put some barbed wire on top of the damn thing. And if you see any animals around it, shoot them. That includes bears. Oh, Dick, Jane. Let's just step in here for a moment. You, uh, you worried about the competition? - We eliminate the competition. - I like your style, son. Now, the deal was a thousand a piece. Half now, and half later, correct? I don't want to see either one of you until after you win your scholarship. - Someone with all your dough, you sure are a cheap bastard. - Well, that's how I keep my dough, young lady. - Damn it. I hate camping. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. You starve, you get cold, you get eaten up by bugs. And why is this thing so short? - Marsha, you know you'd feel better if you just made up with Johnny. - I tried. He thinks I'm a billboard. - I have an idea. - Wow. You look real nice. - Well, it's... Just something I threw together. Kind of last minute. I guess it'll take time before I can really come up with my own personal style. - No, it's perfect. Want to try my jacket? It goes with that. - Can you reach it or should I lean forward a little? - No, you're fine. Whoops. Almost finished. - You are? - Uh-huh. There. - That's it? - Hope you like it. Probably be the last haircut I do for a while. - But why? - Oh, I don't know, it just doesn't turn me on the way it used to. * Someone said love is great * They said you're kinda late * They said love will make you metal out * * I said no * I've got to scream and shout * No, like a glass of wine * Sooth you, make you feel so fine * * I said no, that's not for me * I want a love like a chainsaw * - Hi.

It's the Nuge, man, it's really him. - I couldn't stop myself. I was back in the woods about 40 miles to the North, and I heard the music. And I said to myself, Mr. Tasty, it's time to move, it's time to get down, it be time to jam. I gotta tell you, you played loud. - Wow. That's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me, man. - I see you met our grandson, Teddy. - Your grandson? You're kidding. - How do you think I learned to play like this? - One, two, three, four. * I want my love like a chainsaw * * That's what love is * Ripping through the dreams * That's what love is * Cut off at the knees * That's what love is * Do me if you please * Love is like a chainsaw * Now, don't you be late * Baby, don't hesitate * Got my plans and I got my schemes * * I want you * In my chainsaw dreams * A mule that I can't control * So shake it to my very soul * Tether isn't what I crave * Give me love like a chainsaw * That's what love is * So, do me if you please * My love is like a chainsaw * Was a wild kid * That's what love is - Truckie, you didn't go through the park in your bear suit, did you? Somebody could have seen you. Hey, Truckie, are you okay? - Rancewell won. Tomorrow, Five o'clock, he's got my store, the land, and his factory. And the hell of it is, I saw his toxic dumpers. He's unloading something inside those gates. - Can't you just tell somebody about this? - No one will believe me. I've got no proof. - Welcome to our Weewankah Wilderness Challenge.

My name's Eddie Claussens and-- - Oh, you're Eddie, then you're looking for Linnie? - That's right. - Let's see. Turn right by the recreation hall, follow that road all the way down to the lake. Everybody's there getting ready for the race. - Thank you. - Any time. - Linnie. - Hi, Eve. Ranger Brian said I could run in the race today just for the fun of it. Eddie. - Hi, Eddie. - Hi, Eddie. - Wilderness challengers. - Yo, Rocket! - Take your marks. - Yo, Rocket! - Get set. - Sorry, dude, I didn't realize I was so close. - Jerk. - Give me your camera. - Why? - Just give it to me. - Put on that life jacket. Mind those rapids. - Thank you. - WHat's this? - Your compass, topographical map, and control card. - I thought I was supposed to grab these little flags as I run along. - Well, you have to grab the coded punch at each flag, and then you have to punch your control card. - Okay, but what about these little flags? - Well, you have to find them. - Find them? - Yeah. - What do you mean, find them? Louis. Louis, I'm gonna kill you. - Come on, come on, come on. There, hold it. - How you doing, dudes? - 10 degrees North of the mountain trail next to the mossy boulder. What trail? What boulder? - Stop kidding around, dude, we gotta finish the race. - Dick, we can go through here. No trespassing, ha. No, no. - What do we got here? - Eve, what are you doing? - Come here. - Oh. A rare protista delphinium. Hmm, look at that. Oh, the flag's over there. - Son of a bitch. - Hey, hey you, get over here. - Jump, jump. Jump, come on, jump. - And the winner is, Linnie Roach. - Hold on, Willy. - Get on turn. - Huh, I knew it. - You, I'll make sure you two rot in jail for this. - You should be in jail, Rancewell, let me go. - It's not me, it's Rancewell. - Get this truck out of here. Well, I must say, I'm shocked, shocked. In addition to the new jobs and the revenue, which my factory will provide, I was building new concession for this park. Well, this poor kid, he must have misunderstood. - Rancewell's dumping-- - He's dumping toxic waste in the park, you've gotta stop this. - Is this how you get rid of your toxic waste? - How does it feel to be caught green handed? - You're a disgrace to the uniform. - Get this scum out of here. - You did it. - We did it. - Guess what Linnie won. - Linnie won the $5,000 scholarship. - That's great, that's great. Linnie, this is made out to me. Linnie, I can't take this. - Sure you can. We're the three musketeers, remember? Consider it a loan. - So, like, are you guys gonna come down and join the party? - Like we told you, as soon as you cut us down. - You know we can't do that, dudes, the sign says no trespassing. - You idiots, forget the sign. - Sorry, but we'll save you a beer. - You know it, dude. Bye. - This week, I've been exploring some other possibilities. I guess you've noticed some of my special styling. - Yeah, Linnie. You don't have to tell me this if you don't want to. - No, Eddie, I have to. It's just not the same without real love. Please help us. I can't believe you talked me into this. - Are you sure he's coming? - I'm telling you, it's gonna work. - Well, where is he? - He'll come, let's just scream again, okay? - Okay. - Help. - Please. He's not coming, I knew it, he's not coming. - I tell you, it's gonna work. Believe me, okay? - Oh, you're crazy. - No, I know he's gonna be here any second, I can feel it, come on, just be louder. - Help! - How much longer you gonna wear that? - Why, do you want me to take it off? - That thing's so hot. Don't you want to cool down? - Truckie, stop it. - So, all this time, you just wanted me for my bear suit, huh? - No. I was only after the reward. - Help. - Help me. - Me? - I mean... * Oh * Ah He helped me before. - What about me? I can't believe it, I am tied to a tree with a bleach blond bimbo. - What? I am not bleached. It's completely natural. - I've had enough of this, I'm leaving. Ouch, I'm really stuck. - Oh, you are not. - Yes I am, I'm really stuck. - I think I'm stuck too. - Help, help, help! Anymore bright ideas? - Weewaunkah Willy, where are you? * Oh oh oh * Oh * Ah * Oh yeah * State park * Oh oh * Ha ha ha * State park * Oh * Ah * Ah * Hm hm hm * Ah * State park
