More? -Enough. I'm going. I'm gone. -Take care. Fetch! Come! Good! I'm going to sleep. Kanoko It's been a long time. Thank you for coming. It's been three years. Too long. You never call. Where have you been? I'm sorry. I never imagined you'd marry an artist. Am I not the type? -I wouldn't say that. What do you think of my husband's work? I don't understand art... but it's pretty shocking. Kanoko...are you happy now? I don't know. It's different from before. Five years is a long time. We're not newlyweds anymore. If we had a child, things might be different... But I'm afraid of kids. You don't want children? It just hasn't happened. -I see. Your husband is a graduate of Tokyo University, right? I'd guess he's already a company manager. Not yet. He's still just an assistant. -Oh. Hard work isn't enough to make it up the corporate ladder. He has to bring work home, too. So he's yawning all the time. Yawning? Really? Hey, can you come visit us sometime? I have something to show you. What do you want to show me? You'll be surprised. He had 'artist's block', and then he started using me as a model Then his vision became clear. Right? Then an art broker recognized his talent. Well...she's totally responsible. S/M is considered somewhat abnormal in proper society. But I think that's because people don't open their minds. There are so many types of existence in this world. Sexuality should reflect the same thing. Our sex play is simply a variation of life. We should admit to a fascination with S/M, on a subconscious level. To execute the fantasy, I must have trust from my mate. I must also have cooperation and courage. Good afternoon. Yes. Come in. Let me introduce her to you. She is Yumeko Kawamura, my husband's assistant ...a college art student. Nice to meet you. So then, we must get ready for work. -Yes. Come along. This is a basic bondage pose. I want to show you something interesting. Something my wife is hooked on. Come on, let me see. Woof! What's wrong with you? Do it from behind. I'll visit you Sunday afternoon. What? Yes. It went well. My husband? He's reluctant, but he sounds interested. Yes. He's just the shy type. Please say hi to your husband. Come in. This way. Hello...welcome. She's already started her dog play. She's not a woman right now. She's a bitch. Come, you must show our guests the results of your training. Say hi to them. Get closer to him. Show the guests how she manages her bathroom duties. Yes. Want a drink? I'll right, I'll give you some. Mister, do you want to join? No. So...get undressed. Everything. I must tie your feet too. I thought you liked to be treated this way. Husband. What's wrong? I need the toilet. Do it in here. Today you should join the play. Train your wife to be a dog. I'd be happy to. Can you bring the collar? Yes. If you'd be good enough to undress for us.... Quickly. You must remove your clothes here. It's part of the game. Attach the collar. How do you feel about being a dog in front of people... especially your husband? The play has already started. Greet everyone. Teach her how to do it. Say bow-wow. Her husband agrees with this. Don't spoil the little dog. Bark a greeting. Bark louder. Teach her how to walk. What do you think about her as a dog? Do you want to take the leash by yourself, sir? Let's go to the studio. Bring it in. Lady, now you can learn how a dog acts. Bring the butter. Yes. Don't scream like a human... you are a dog. Remember the training at Takita's house. Once you wear this collar, you are no longer human. Don't say a word. Your language is bow-wow. Do you understand? Woof. Bark louder. You won't get a treat so fast. Fist we go for a walk. Heel. Quickly. Quick. I don't think a dog walks like that. Eh? No! You aren't supposed to say a word. Next time, you'll get the whip. I can't hear you. Bark louder. Yes, good girl. You're getting better. Good girl. Ok... Now you get the treat. From my toes... Not yet. Be patient. Ready? -Woof. Good night. Cheers. Tonight is our festival. I have many ideas. Do you want to use...body paint? Body paint? "bitch" "pussy" Ready? Go! Reverse. Turn. Turn around. The winner is a male dog. The loser is a female. Now you'll be a candleholder. More. You have a big appetite. -Yes. This much? -Yes. Kanako. -What? Never mind. Here...be careful. Come home soon. -Yes. Good bye. English translation by Yuko Mihara and Thomas Weisser
