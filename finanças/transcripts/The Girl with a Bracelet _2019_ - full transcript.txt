The Girl With A Bracelet Two years later Yes? I'm here to see Lise. For? - Just a visit. And you are? - Diego. How did you get in? The door was open, so... Sorry, Lise is busy. You're sure? She asked me to come. She made a mistake. You can't just wander in, this is private property. Could you tell her I came? So she can call me. And you're Diego who? Ask Lise! Diego who? Diego Maradona! Am I disturbing you? - No. Who's Diego? - Who? A charmer who just turned up. Who is he? A friend. I got that, but who is he? Diego who? I don't know. - You don't know his name? Diego, I just told you. - Where's he from? You didn't meet him on a correspondence course. Noémie introduced us. She knows him on Facebook. I don't want him here and you're not allowed out. That's that. Stay focused. Do as you please after, but right now I want no disturbances. Things get around. So, no more Diego, nobody, period. It's not open house here. OK? I didn't hear. Agreed? Yes, Dad. What are you doing? Reading over my interviews, the lawyer asked me to. How's it going with her? She's strict but OK. You're sure? - Yes, I like her style. OK, I'll let you rehearse then. It's not a performance, I'm just re-reading. Not at school? No, it's Wednesday. What are you doing? - Nothing. I'm bored. Want to play football? No, I'm resting. Wanna go out? - No. My bracelet makes football awkward. You can be goalie. Not interested. Drop it. If you go to prison, can I have your room? If you want. I don't care. Really? - Yeah. But for now, get lost. For sale How do you feel? - OK, normal. And you? OK. I'm not coming to your trial. Did you hear me? - Yes. Are you angry? - Not at all. I can't come. I have my patients... - Mum, it's OK. No need to make excuses. Did you tell Dad? - Yes. He took it badly. He'll be there, you won't be alone. - I know. I'll be thinking of you. - I know. There are six jurors. Try to look at all of them when you speak. Look at the judge and the prosecutor, but also at the victim's lawyer when he questions you. Look at them, but don't forget you're also being watched. And not always by people who wish you well. Good morning. - Good morning. I'll take her in, we'll take the back door. OK. Shall I park here? - If you like. Be confident. You're ready. Hello, Lise. - Hello. Coming with me? I came home just before 3pm. Flora had had friends over, so I wasn't surprised to see bottles everywhere in the sitting room. Then I wanted a glass of water, but they were all dirty. I thought it was time she got up and tidied the place. So I went upstairs. Her door was open. I saw her as soon as I went in. It was horrible. I don't remember it all, just fragments. There was blood. The sheets were red. It was also on the walls and... on the headboard. Her body was unrecognisable... because of the wounds all over her body. Only her face had been spared, and her eyes were open. Some details for the court. Telephone records show that Mrs Dufour called the police at 2:52pm, then she called her mother at 2:54pm. Are there any questions? I have one question for my client. Flora is your only daughter, you raised her alone and had a strong relationship with her. Did she have any enemies? No, none. Thank you. Madame Prosecutor? - No questions, Your Honour. For the defense? Hello, madam. I have a question, if I may. When you came home, did you use the front door and was it unlocked? Yes, it was unlocked. So anyone coming from outside could open the door without a key? Yes. Thank you, madam. Mrs. Dufour, I propose to leave it there. Thank you for your testimony. You may return to your seat. Miss Bataille, could you stand up, please? How old are you? I'm 18. So at the time...? - 16, nearly 17. You reside in Nantes, with your parents? Yes, and my little brother. Afterwards, you were first put on remand? Yes. For how long? - 6 months. The investigating judge released you on December 21st, 2016 and placed you under house arrest with an electronic bracelet? - Yes. What was your relationship with the victim, Flora Dufour? We were friends, best friends. You've just heard the testimony of Béatrice Dufour. Can you tell us, from your point of view, what happened, beginning with the evening before? We partied at Flora's, and I slept there. How far is your house from Flora's? About 5 minutes by foot. Why didn't you go home after the party? Because I wanted to stay at Flora's. Did Flora ask you to stay? - No. Did you ask Flora if you could stay? No. It just happened. I was tired, I went to sleep. So it was your own initiative to stay at Flora's house? Yes. And where did you sleep? - In her room. Do you know if other people stayed over? As far as we knew, we were alone in the house. And in the morning? I got up late and rushed to pick up my brother from school. When I left, everything was normal. Flora was still asleep. I didn't lock the door because I didn't have the keys. You say that you were in a hurry to pick your brother up from school. Can you tell us what time you left Flora's house? I was late and I left Flora's between 11.20 and 11.30. And then? I got on my scooter and picked up my brother. It was sunny, so we went to the park. We spent about an hour there then we joined my parents at the sea. We have a house there. That afternoon the police came to get me. Do you have anything to add? No, that's all. So, Miss Lise Bataille, you say that on Saturday June 7th 2016, you neither assaulted nor killed Flora Dufour? Yes, that's right. This is the state of the victim's body as it was photographed at the crime scene at 3:17pm. The victim's body displayed 7 wounds, of varying depths all caused by the same sharp, serrated object, like a kitchen knife. All the wounds, with the exception of cut A, are superficial. Cut A is a spindle-shaped wound with clean edges, situated on the right posterior side of the neck. The dissection shows a section of the right internal carotid with hemorrhagic infiltration. The examination revealed blood on the tongue in the trachea and bronchi, in the esophagus and the stomach. In your expert opinion, the crime occurred between noon and 1:00pm? Yes. - How reliable is that estimate? The more recent the crime, the more accurate we are. At 3:30pm, the first signs of rigor mortis were visible in the upper limbs. One can say death occurred three hours before, with a comfortable margin of error. So between noon and 1:00pm. We are often cautious about timing, but this range is reliable. The court thanks you for your expertise. Thank you. Are there questions for the accused on this aspect of the case? No. Madame Prosecutor? Miss Bataille, please stand. How long does it take by scooter from the victim's house to the school? 15-20 minutes. Closer to 15 minutes, according to a police timing done at the request of the investigating judge. See file number D312. What time did you leave the home of Flora Dufour? 11:30am. Yet you were not at the school by noon? It might have been 11:40. It might have been 11:40? Or was it perhaps 11:50, or 12:20, even 12:40? - No, that's impossible. I left at 11:30, give or take a few minutes. You're not very precise. Supposing you met your brother a little after noon, what did you do next? I remind the jury that it was only at 1:40pm that you were seen at Villeret petrol station, which is just 20 minutes from the school. We went to the park. How long did you spend there? About an hour. The weather was nice. You stayed an hour in the park? Quite a time. Yet, in his first statement, your brother doesn't even mention going to the park. How do you explain that? I can't explain it. I think he talked about it later. - Yes, you're well informed. He spoke of it in his second statement, 7 months later, when you were no longer on remand. These insinuations are unpleasant and dishonest. Lise Bataille doesn't have to account for her brother's evidence, who was 8 at the time. Continue, but restrict yourself to questions. Assuming you went to the park, for which there is no proof, what did you do next? As I said, we joined our parents at the seaside on my scooter. Stopping at Villeret petrol station, where you were seen at 1:40? Yes. Your Honour, I now wish to show those video images. Of course. Clerk, would you please play the video? Miss Bataille, can you tell us what you saw? I paid for the petrol and then Jules wanted a sandwich. I gave him some money and we left. Indeed. Your Honour, I'd like to show another video clip, from camera 1, starting at minute 40 please. Clerk. Miss, would you please look carefully at these images? Could we enlarge the image, so the accused can see the image better? Do you usually sit this way? I was tired. You sit like that when you are tired? It's how I sat then. Why did you take that position, at precisely that moment? Because I wanted to, that's all. If I said that you don't seem to be yourself in those images, what would you say? That I don't agree. I told you I was exhausted, I hadn't slept. Yet it is not a customary position for you? Miss? Your silence moves me on to my last question. You said nothing to the police while you were in custody, nor to the investigating judge during your first three interviews. Obviously that was noticed. What did that silence mean? Were you terrified, or in shock, because of what you saw, or did perhaps? Have you finished, Madame Prosecutor? Yes, Your Honour. Miss Bataille, you saw, as we did, the photos of your friend Flora when the police arrived at the crime scene. How do they affect you? Tell us simply what you feel when you think of them. Nothing? Try. I don't know. How was it? - Great. Are they gonna put you in prison? I hope so. Then I won't see you anymore. Are you going to prison or not? - Stop it Jules, you know they won't. Can I come with you tomorrow? - No, you're too little. Dad, can I come tomorrow? Stop it, Jules. - Like I said, you're too little. How did it go? Are you even interested? Where's Lise? In her room. She's not in her room, or with Jules. Sorry to disturb you, it's Lise's dad. - Good evening. She's not with you? - No, why? She went for a walk and still isn't back. I wondered if she was with Noémie. - No, we haven't seen her. May I speak to Noémie? I tried her mobile but there was no answer. I'll get her. Hold on. - Thanks. Sorry. Noémie? It's Lise's dad. Hello? - Is Lise with you? No... Do you know where she might be? - I've no idea. Is there somewhere she likes to go? A bar? A bar? Where? A bar or something else. I don't know, I'm looking. She has her electronic bracelet. You can find her. I'd rather not. Give me Paco's number. Who? Paco, the kid with the curly hair. I doubt she went to see him. If she's not with you, she must be with him. Dunno... - Who's she with then? Does she have another friend? - No. OK, give me his number. - I don't have it. Where does he live? - On Heurteaux Street, by the bus stop. It's Diego, not Paco. - OK, thanks. I've checked, it's connected. What's she up to? - She's just left, or they'd have called. She can't be far. What if the prison service calls? Don't answer. - Of course I will! You asked my advice and I gave it. Goddammit! Good evening. I've come for Lise, I'm her father. - There's no Lise here. No Diego either? - Yes, but he is not in. Where is he? What do you want? I've come for my daughter. I know she's been here before. It's possible... - No, it's certain. Don't take me for a fool. Where's Diego's room? - That's not the question... Yes, it is. Where is his room? Come in and check if you like. That's enough, now. Lise? Lise! Mum! Mum! Jules! Jules! - Come and see! What is it? - The lighthouse is off! I don't care! Let's go home. How come? - Come on! She isn't at that guy's place. I'll have to tell the lawyer. We know where she is. - You do? Noémie found her on Avenue des Frênes. Avenue des Frênes? - Yes. Pick her up. I'm at La Bernerie with Jules. What's she doing there? She's losing it. See you soon. You know you can't go near Flora's house? No one saw me. Noémie saw you, so you're not invisible. You're wearing an electronic bracelet. - I know. What if the prison service had called? - Did they? No. So, it's all good. What do we tell the judge if he finds out? I didn't, I was 500m from the house. What were you thinking? We're here to help you. But if you don't play along, there's nothing we can do. Do you realise what's at stake? - Yes. Why didn't you answer when the judge asked how you felt seeing the pictures of Flora? I'd have said I was disgusted, or that they hurt. I don't know, something to show I cared. You think I don't care? I didn't say that. But the court is watching and you're not making it easy. I say this for your own good. When the trial's over, could you stop telling me what to do? Thanks. Lise was a happy girl, not at all the quiet type. On the contrary, she was talkative. We talked a lot and we were close. Yet you use the past tense. Inevitably, Flora's death and what came after changed everything. You could say that because of that, she became withdrawn. But at the time of the events, or just before, everything was normal. Lise was an ordinary girl, hardworking and inquisitive. Did she feel good about herself? - Absolutely, yes. Does the prosecution have any questions? I have no questions. Madame Prosecutor? Mr Bataille, hello. Where were you the week before the crime? At home, working. And where was your daughter? She spent the week revising at the seaside and only left for Flora's party. When you saw her the day of the crime, you hadn't seen her for a week? Not since the previous Sunday. You can say your daughter was a normal, happy girl in general, but you cannot say she was as serene in the days before the crime since you did not see her. You say your daughter spoke willingly to you, that communication between you was easy. Did you know that Flora and Lise had an argument a month before the events? - Yes. Can you tell us what it was about? Flora put a video online that shouldn't have been there. Lise was angry, but it was quickly settled. You knew that the argument was about a video? I knew they'd fallen out over a video being put online. But you didn't know it was a pornographic video of your daughter? I didn't know the exact details. So you didn't talk that much. There's always some distance in a father-daughter relationship. It's important. You were unaware of the most significant event in your daughter's life. Understandably significant, since it hurt, wounded and revolted her. I knew that she had been wounded. - But not how deeply, because you didn't know what was in the video. That's your interpretation. Now I'd like to discuss your daughter's arrest. Please give your version of events. We were at the sea, the police came, asked to talk to her, and she left with them. So you saw no resistance from your daughter? It was very fast. Exactly, which means she didn't protest? When your conscience is clear, you have no reason to run. She could simply have asked why they came to question her, or at least expressed surprise. She was surprised. You thought she was surprised? - Yes, of course. How did she show her surprise? She just was. It showed in her face. As your daughter went away, what was your first reaction? I asked the police what they wanted from her. You were surprised. - Obviously. You asked what was going on, you asked questions. How do you explain that your daughter did not? I told you she was surprised. But she did not express it in words. That makes no difference. Madame Prosecutor, do you have other questions? Yes, Your Honour, I have another question for Mr. Bataille. For two years now, you have insisted that your daughter is innocent. After investigation, your daughter is the only person accused. So, if Lise did not kill Flora Dufour, who did commit this crime? I don't know. Thank you. Well, well! There! Just pretend I'm not here, OK? Oh, my! It's amazing what goes on. Everything OK? - Hey, she's filming. Any comments? That's enough! - You have to finish! That's enough! - You can't stop there. I did it. That's enough, I did it! You sucked him for two seconds. You can't leave him like that, he's not finished. Come on! - It's OK, she did it! Miss Rigaud, did Lise tell you about her dispute with Flora? Yes. - What did she tell you? That it was wrong. People were saying Lise was bad, that she was a slut. Sorry. Go on. The court has heard worse. That's all. She wished Flora hadn't done it. That she filmed her? No, she knew that, even though she was blowing Nathan. She didn't get why Flora posted the video without telling her. You indicated that you were with Lise when she saw the video was online. Can you confirm that? - Yes. We were at her place. Can you tell us about that? What was her first reaction? Lise wanted to remove it. She knew Flora's password, but when she tried to log in we found out Flora had changed it. She left a message asking her to take it down at once. A voice message? - Yes. Flora didn't answer, her phone just rang. So Flora didn't remove the video? - No. Lise knew it would spread fast, she got worked up. Indeed. Lise Bataille called Flora Dufour a lot of names and in the midst of it all she said "I'll kill you". How did she deliver these insults? By phone? - No, on Snapchat. If she'd meant it, she wouldn't have used that. Lise Bataille didn't simply say: "I'll kill you". If we refer to the file, Lise Bataille threatened Flora Dufour, writing, and I quote, "I'm going to kill you", then again "I'm going to kill you" and finally "You're dead". Flora didn't reply, and Lise got mad. I'd have been mad too. It was just words, like when girlfriends say "I love you", it means nothing. Everyone says it. How did this dispute develop? Was it forgotten, did it die down, or did it get sorted out? It was settled. I was there when Lise asked Flora to explain and to apologise. Flora apologised and said she didn't realise when she posted the video that people would talk so much. And after that? They said "I love you" and it was like before. Thank you. You are the young man to whom Lise gave oral sex, which was filmed and put online by Flora, about a month before the crime? - Yes. Could you describe the context and your state of mind that led to the making of this video? We'd had some math homework and Lise said she would never get a worse mark than me, but if she did, she'd give me a blow job. I got 14 and she got 13.5. So it was Lise's idea? Yes, but I didn't think she would really do it. Did she have a reputation for doing things like that? I knew she was open. I had friends who'd done things with her and then told me, but even so I was surprised. At that time you were not yet in a relationship with Flora? No. - But you were flirting already? We were about to get together, I knew she wanted to and I was more and more interested. How did you know? I was told. - By whom? Lise. They were best friends so she played intermediary. So... Lise told you that her best friend wanted to go out with you and yet Lise gave you oral sex, on her own initiative, as a forfeit, in front of the friend concerned? Yes, kind of. - What do you mean, kind of? Well, yes, that's right. Any questions from the prosecution? Yes, Your Honour. Nathan, you were often with Flora before her death, you were perhaps the person she spent most time with. According to you, and from what Flora told you, was the dispute between Lise and Flora over at the time of the events? No, not at all. What makes you say that? Flora apologised but Lise refused to forgive her. Yet everything seemed normal again. Yes, but something was different. It made her uncomfortable. That's something you noticed? - Yes. And she told me so. She told me she was scared. She said Lise scared her? - Yes. She said: "She scares me so much", "She freaks me out", things like that. When did she say that? At least twice. The first time was just after the death threats. So she took Lise's threats seriously? - Very seriously. And then she repeated that she was afraid of Lise? Yes. The night before the party. The night before the crime? - Yes. That's all, Your Honour. Thank you, Nathan. Prosecutor, do you have any questions? No, Your Honour, everything has been said. Defense counsel? - Yes. I don't quite follow. You claim Flora was afraid of Lise. Why invite her to the party, then? She didn't want to make things worse, and she thought it was the best thing to do. Or the least bad. And you? Why did you not sleep at Flora's that night? Why did you leave her alone with Lise when Flora said Lise scared her? I wasn't allowed to sleep over. My parents told me to come home and it was nearly 1am when I got in. The party wasn't over but I had no choice. Besides, I didn't know that Lise would sleep over at Flora's. Your Honour, may we see the video filed under D71? It was found on Flora Dufour's phone. It has been authenticated and the images come from Noémie Rigaud's phone, at 11:41pm on June 6th 2016, during the party at Flora Dufour's house, several hours before she was found dead. Clerk, could you start the video please? What is your question? My question is for the court: do you feel you are seeing two enemies on this video? It could easily be a strategy, on the part of Lise Bataille, to imply a relaxed relationship with Flora Dufour. I ask the jurors, do you think from this video that Flora Dufour feared Lise Bataille? It was a crowded party, Flora Dufour wasn't about to run away. Are there any more questions for our witness? No, Your Honour. I'd like the accused to clarify a point raised during the examination of Mr. Meurin. Miss Bataille, please stand up. What did you feel when Flora Dufour started going out with Nathan Meurin? Nothing. I was happy for her. The fact he might become Flora's boyfriend didn't affect your desire for him? No. Besides, I was seeing other boys, I was never stuck on Nathan. But you had feelings for him? - No. You had no feelings for the boy you had oral sex with? No, none. Would you say you're what is known as "easy?" What d'you mean? Why not ask Nathan if he is "easy" too? We did it because we both wanted to. If I'd known it would hurt Flora we'd never have done it, but at the time, how could we know? Thank you. Scared you! Little shit! Did you know she'd had lots of boyfriends? I knew there'd been a few. - No, lots. She had some schoolgirl crushes. We all started in high school, right? - This is different. Apparently she's giving blow jobs to guys she hardly knows. She talks so calmly about it. Did you know that? I don't get it. It felt like they were talking about someone else. And I was there, but not really there. You were right, I shouldn't have gone. No, you were right to go. You think? - Of course. What's happening tomorrow? I don't remember. Keep your mouth shut, or you won't get my room. I'll go with you. We have analysed the victim's body, but also the sheets covering the mattress, the duvet cover and the pillowcases. We found fingerprints, hair and saliva traces and each time the data matched. In your report you also mention the victim's fingernails. Can you tell us more? Yes. Sterile samples were taken from all the pieces of nail in order to recover any cells resulting from contact. They led to the same conclusion. So you also found deposits under the victim's nails? Yes. And the DNA belongs to Lise Bataille. So it's possible that Flora Dufour scratched Lise Bataille during a struggle? It's one interpretation. My role is to identify the trace evidence, produce a genetic profile. In this case, it is that of Lise Bataille. Jury members, Flora Dufour was attacked, stabbed seven times. The genetic fingerprint of one person was found on the victim's body, and it is that of Lise Bataille. Defense counsel? The prosecutor likes to appeal to jurors' powers of interpretation, not to say their imagination. Miss Bataille, can you confirm what you have always said, that you slept at Flora Dufour's house on the night of 6-7 June? Yes. Could you describe that night? - In detail? Yes, tell us what happened that night. I went to bed a bit before Flora, I fell asleep straight away. Then she came to join me, and that woke me up. So you slept in the same bed? - Yes, in Flora's bed. How were you dressed? I was just wearing panties, I'd brought nothing with me. And Flora? She had a big T-shirt, but she took it off because we were too hot. Why were you so hot? She has a small bed, we were lying close together. That makes you hot. Did you hold each other? Yes. Did you kiss? - A bit. She'd been drinking so she smelled of alcohol. I liked that. Did you embrace? Yes. If not violent, was it sometimes vigorous? Yes. Particularly when I was down there. Down there? Yes, when I licked her. She held my head. Did she scratch you? - A bit. When you were examined the day after the events there was no bruising, just a slight scratch near your ear, see file number B111. She scratched you because she had an orgasm? Yes, she felt pleasure and she held my head like that. And after that? We stroked each other and fell asleep. Did you sleep beside each other? Yes, at first anyway. Were you both naked? - Yes. All night? - Yes, all night. I ask the expert witness, did you find my client's DNA all over the victim's body? Yes, absolutely. Including her genitals? Yes, traces of saliva. So the traces observed on the victim's body, on her mouth and genitals, are consistent with sexual relations that night? I can confirm that. Do you also agree that, having established Flora Dufour and Lise Bataille slept naked together and touched each other, it is inevitable that Lise Bataille's DNA would be on the victim's body? Yes, that's correct. Finally we have something tangible, a fact not open to interpretation, whether the defense likes it or not. Only the DNA of Lise Bataille was on the victim's body. I see that as incriminating rather than exonerating. I would like to ask the accused a question about this episode. Go ahead. Miss Bataille, did you talk to Flora when she came to bed or during the night? No. When we were lying together she just said she liked the way I smelled. And after? We fell asleep and then it was morning and I left without waking her. Was that the first time you had made love? We didn't really make love. We pleased each other, that's all. Have you often shared nights like this? Yes, lots of times. Yesterday we were told that Flora Dufour was afraid of you, today you claim you spent the night with her, during which you pleased each other. Do you see that it is difficult to understand or believe you? How would you describe your relationship with Flora? Were you in love? No, not at all. We were friends. Thank you. Sir, what is your speciality? My research is essentially on the analysis of stab wounds. Your report is very precise. What makes you say that the blows were made by someone left-handed? The location of the wounds on the body and the orientation of the blade during penetration of the cutaneous tissues indicate that the object was held in the murderer's left hand. Can you tell the court the estimated size of the knife blade? - Yes. It would be between 6.5 and 7cm long and 2.2 to 2.6cm wide, with a pointed end. Your Honour, may we break seal number 39? It concerns a set of knives. Of course. Clerk? Could you show it to the court? Good. Please show it to counsel. Has counsel noted that seal 39 is intact? Perfect. Clerk, would you break seal 39? Please take it to Madame Prosecutor. Miss Bataille, do you recognise this set of knives? I know it's from our house at La Bernerie. Do you recognise it? - Yes. You can see that a knife is missing? Yes. According to the manufacturer, the missing knife has a red handle. More interestingly, it is a pointed knife with a blade 6.7cm long and 2.3cm wide, dimensions consistent with the expert's estimate of the model that fatally injured the victim. So, I turn to you: where do you think this red knife is? I don't know. - You don't know. Did you use this set of knives during the week before the crime? Yes, it's possible. It's certain, since your fingerprints were found on the set. I cooked sometimes so I may have used the knives. And the set was complete? No, one knife was already missing. Are you sure? - Yes. That's odd, because in a previous statement you said you'd never noticed this knife set. Now you're sure one knife was missing? Yes. What refreshed your memory? Perhaps it's a family trait, things come and go, a bit like your brother who at first forgot to mention that you spent an hour in the park? What I know for sure is that it's an old set of knives that has been there forever. It's a holiday home, people come and go. Nothing is where it should be. The knife wasn't in its place and hadn't been for ages. We haven't found this knife. It has totally disappeared. How do you explain that? I repeat, according to the police the knife is not in the set, nor anywhere else. How do you explain this disappearance? I can't explain everything. Pardon? I didn't catch that. Someone must have taken it. - Who? I don't know, someone who needed a knife. No one remembers doing so, yet it's not something one usually does. Perhaps it was broken. The red knife broke! Better and better. I don't know where the knife is! I didn't see it or take it. Does my asking about this knife irritate you, miss? I've nothing more to say. Are you aware that by denying all involvement, you deprive yourself of the chance to explain what set off your anger and the actions that followed? Would you confirm that you are left-handed? Yes, I write with my left hand. Mrs Bataille, your testimony is not on the agenda. But by virtue of my discretionary powers I've agreed to the request of your daughter's lawyer that you testify. I remind the court that you are the mother of the accused, and as such, you are not required to swear an oath. Before the court asks you any questions, you have the floor. I know my daughter didn't do anything. Do you have anything more concrete to tell us to support your argument? Lise was in the wrong place at the wrong time and this story is haunting her. Let's discuss your daughter's personality, if you will. Yesterday, your husband painted a portrait of Lise emphasising how much this affair had changed her. Could you describe how you see Lise's personality? When she was accused of this crime everything changed for her. She was imprisoned, which was a shock for us all, but even afterwards, she was cut off, isolated from her friends. Her social life ended. Do you think she withdrew? The situation made her withdraw. She could resume her studies, but by correspondence, which distanced her from others. It's been hard, not hearing her talk or laugh, except sometimes with her little brother. That's been our only joy these last two years. Any questions for Mrs Bataille? - No, Your Honour. Madame Prosecutor? Mrs. Bataille, you said your daughter's tragedy was to find herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Have you never had your doubts during these two years? When your daughter is arrested, then imprisoned, when everyone thinks she's guilty, you start to wonder. So of course I've had doubts. At one point I wanted to go over everything again. The months before Flora's death, Lise's behaviour before the party, her return to La Bernerie, her attitude when she joined us there. I went over it thousands of times. His Honour asked if I have anything concrete. I said no because that's what I found. Nothing. No clue. No solid facts. No credible hypothesis. Perhaps you are so positive because you're talking about your daughter. One could also argue that you doubt me because you're the prosecutor. But you're right, you look for something tangible. That's your role. Thank you. Mrs Bataille, an element has come to the notice of the court, and some of those watching. Your husband has been at your daughter's side since the trial began. But you asked Lise's lawyer to take your place, and you asked to be excused. I had to work. - I understand. But generally, even if the law does not oblige them to be there, relatives manage to be present on trial days. I've nothing to add. You had to work and yet you are here. Does that mean that the justification you provided is simply a convenience? Your Honour, Mrs. Bataille provided the correct documentary proof. Lise loved Flora like a sister. They grew up together. They were friends since infant school. When Flora died, it was a shock because we lost one of our own. I say that with all respect for the pain of Béatrice, Flora's mother. But when Lise was arrested I knew something was wrong. It didn't stand up. Then mulling things over, you realise you are doing nothing else and that it's pointless. It ate away at me. I saw that it was making life impossible, for me, for my husband, but above all for Lise. We tried to protect our younger son, but it was untenable. Our life was suspended. There was nothing else. What Flora endured is unspeakable, terrible. But Lise being in the wrong place at the wrong time should not cost her her youth. So I did what I could. I tried to make sure life went on. I went back to work, especially since... I couldn't afford not to. My husband and I are self-employed and he had stopped working too. It was probably selfish, because it took me away from all that, but it was also a deep conviction. We are guilty of nothing, Lise is guilty of nothing. Life must go on, even if it's actually impossible. If I may, madam, what you have said does not explain your absence from the trial. If I insist on that, and I'll be honest with you, it's because your absence could be interpreted as abandonment, even a sort of confession on your part. In a way you could say I gave up. I gave up because there were two of us. I knew my husband would stay the course even when it seemed impossible to me. I knew he'd always be there for me and Lise. I've relied on him too much. Did you give up on your daughter? I know my daughter is innocent, so I expected nothing from this trial but also feared it. Sorry, but that's the truth. What do you fear if you're so sure your daughter is innocent? I didn't have the strength to relive this affair again and again. I realised too late and I shied away. I couldn't stop myself. Mrs. Bataille, the court thanks you. You may return to your seat. Miss. Bataille, you have something to add? Yes. Stand up. I'm on trial. Not my mother. What do you mean? I never had the feeling that my mother gave up on me. Nor my father. They are different, with different ways of operating, that's all. I don't want to go to La Bernerie. Why not? It's nice there. We have to clear out the house. If we do nothing we'll go mad. What do you want to do? - I want to stay with Diego. All weekend? - Yes. Can I? - Sure. Really? Yes, really. Thank you. She's not 12 anymore. Thanks, buddy. Jules. Jules! What? - What's that knife? It's just a knife. - Where did you find it? In the tool box in the shed. Come on, there's work to do! Look. He found it in the shed. Put down that knife. Without touching anything, show me exactly where you found it. Where exactly? Don't touch! In the box. At the bottom? Jules, it's important. I dug around a bit and I saw the knife. But where exactly? In the top or in the bottom? You have to know. You have to be precise. Underneath. I opened it and I took the knife. You're sure? - Yes. Don't touch, Jules! Not a thing! They couldn't have missed it during the search. Yet it was there. So someone put it there? Not necessarily. - Yes, that has to be it. They finecombed everything, and they missed a knife that big? It looks that way. You have to go into the living room. What's happened? Hello. - Hello. Wait for me outside, I'll be right out. OK. Jules found it. Where? Where did you find it? - In the shed. Yep. Good, now they'll stop hassling us about it. Is that why you wanted me here? - Of course. What do we do with this knife? Give it to them. We hand it over to the court? Of course, let them keep it. What are you afraid of? Say it. Are you afraid my prints are on it? Or blood? No, I'm not afraid. I just wanted to be sure about giving it to them. You can, it's fine. Happy? Stop it, please. Any other questions? Go ahead. I have no other questions. I apologise. I'll call the lawyer. Can I leave with Diego? - No. Wait until we've reached her. The police will be here, so you're going nowhere. I went into the shed. I was looking for a cutter in the toolbox, to cut the tape. As I was searching, I saw there was no cutter in the toolbox. But I remembered that I'd hidden a knife. Then my mother asked me lots of questions about this knife. You're telling us that you hid the knife? Yes. It was ages ago. I was little. When we played football we'd use a rope to make the crossbar. I used that knife to cut the rope. How exactly did you hide the knife? I put it right at the bottom. There's a sort of floor in the tool box and I'd slide the knife underneath. Can you show us? - Yes. Come here. Could counsel also approach? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please approach as well. May I have a screwdriver? - A screwdriver? Or a pencil. Here. Thank you. That's where we put the knife. You said: "We put the knife." Who do you mean? - Me. Did your sister know? - No. You have to tell the truth. Are you sure your sister did not know? Yes. She never played football with us. Counsel may return to their seats. Jules, please return to the witness stand. Any questions for this young witness? No, Your Honour. Prosecutor? No, I've nothing to say about the knife and the toolbox. This proves absolutely nothing. But the expert opinion on the knife that the prosecution asked for, at your request, Madame Prosecutor, has established that this knife is not the murder weapon, which proves that you were wrong to make it an exhibit. Jules, please join your parents. Miss Bataille, please stand. I would like you to clarify something. What did you feel when your brother found this knife? Nothing in particular. Were you not relieved when analysis proved it was not the murder weapon? Not really. - Why? For me, it changes nothing. This missing knife was something that could have been held against you. The prosecutor didn't hesitate to do so. I knew this knife had nothing to do with the crime. And where is the knife used in the crime? Certainly not at my house. What makes you say that? If I killed someone, I wouldn't take the knife or the gun home. What would you do? I don't know. I'd throw it in the sea, or in the Loire. To be safe. You think that the murder weapon is in the Loire? I don't know. If I did, I wouldn't be here, waiting for this to be over. Are there any last questions for the accused? I declare these proceedings closed. The hearing will resume with the prosecutor's final arguments. What does society consist of? It's the art of being with each other. It's because I represent society here that Miss Bataille's attitude concerns me. Your coldness worries me and your numerous silences are deafening. Our attention has been drawn often to Miss Bataille's intelligence. Intelligence is not a cause for accusation or a defense, but the way it is used is questionable. Miss Bataille excels in concealment. She kept quiet when she did not want to expose herself, she made those close to her talk, especially her brother Jules, when she needed a word of help, even though this contradicted previous declarations made to an examining magistrate. Is this too stark a charge against such a young woman? Must I remind you how tragic this is? Flora Dufour was ruthlessly stabbed. Seven blows of the knife and no regret expressed by the accused. Lise Bataille prefers to wallow in silence, probably in an attempt to escape her own demons. The least one can say is that Miss Bataille was much less secretive when exhibiting herself in videos posted online. Lise Bataille announced her crime and instilled fear in her victim. She isolated Flora Dufour and finally grasped her, literally, to bend her to her will, and finally to kill her. Flora was not killed by the Holy Ghost, or some evil spirit. She died at the determined and resolute hands of Lise Bataille. Lise Bataille is guilty of the murder of Flora Dufour. It was a premeditated act. Given all these elements, I demand for Lise Bataille a sentence of 15 years imprisonment. I confidently await your decision. For my part, I am convinced that Lise Bataille would not be in the dock today if she had not shown the freedom of morals, however commonplace, on which the public prosecutor has dwelt so insistently. However much it may offend some, one can be sixteen and have a sex life, be sixteen and have a desire to live and laugh. Both have been stolen from Lise Bataille. What do we know about adolescents aged 16, 17, 18? What do we know of their codes? Of the relationship they have with their bodies? What do we know of their desires, their fantasies, their wounds and sorrows? What do we know about their friendships, their passions? Whatever the case, sexual freedom has been a given for a long time. So, let's not put it on trial here. The Court of Assizes is the most noble and demanding of jurisdictions, but it has no say in moral judgements. If you convict Lise Bataille, you will have judged her, not given her justice. This trial has produced no proof. You must draw your conclusions according to the criminal code. An acquittal will be not only an act of law but an act of character. An acquittal will rehabilitate a young woman who has been unjustly singled out. An acquittal will affirm more than an intimate conviction, it will affirm the very principle of justice. Miss Bataille, please stand. Do you have anything to add to your lawyer's argument? Yes. Yes? I'd like to say two things that I have not said. The law allows that. Speak. On the first night of the trial I went to Flora's house and stood in the road. I know Béatrice saw me. I shouldn't have come. First because it was forbidden, but also because it hurt you. I wanted to tell you that I came because I miss Flora. And the second thing I want to tell you is that I know I didn't visit after Flora was killed. I didn't talk to you, I didn't even write. I didn't feel able to. Seeing you would make me see Flora again, and that was unbearable. But I'm sorry. I should have done it. I live every day with a regret. If I could go back, I wouldn't leave your house. I would have stayed with Flora that morning. But you can't go back. In any case, if I could, I would come to see you, I promise. These proceedings are over. The court will now consider questions set out in the indictment. This hearing is over. All rise. The court is retiring. The court had two questions to answer. Is Lise Bataille guilty of the intentional homicide of Flora Dufour, as defined in Article 221.1 of the Penal Code? If so, did Lise Bataille act with premeditation? Given the context of the events and the personality of the accused, the court answered "No" with a majority of at least four votes. Therefore, Lise Bataille is acquitted of the charges against her.
