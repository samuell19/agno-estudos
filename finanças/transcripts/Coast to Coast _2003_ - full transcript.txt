So, this is the living room. Oh! You know what I like about this place right away? Great shelves. I'm a reader, too. Are you? Oh, it feels like people have been really happy here. Have they? Why not? Love the Moroccan rug. So do we. It's from India. Oh. It's really beautiful. Is it okay if we check it out upstairs? Yes, of course. That's why I'm having an open house. You just can't keep your mouth shut, can you? You have to say something to people. Yeah, but you say everything. Do you have to make lifelong friends with everyone you meet? Howard. Oh, my God. That girl should split, don't you think? The way he talks to her. Or maybe he should. The Pierces selling 5746 Hillcrest. I cannot believe that you're actually doing it. Well, we haven't exactly got an offer yet. So, listen. I brought you these. Ooh. Kind of a farewell offering, but that doesn't mean you have to go. You know, you should give those to Barney. He and your cookies go back such a long way. Hey, there, Griff! Come here, Griffin. Come here. Oh, ho, ho, who's my boy, huh? Who's my pal? So how does Barnaby feel about selling? He really loves this house. Well, if he wants it, he can keep it. You know, the kids have gone. I get tired of keeping their bedrooms just the way they remember them for when they come by a couple times a year. Oh, is it true? Is he really gonna marry that girl? Who's that? Benjamin, your son. Who's that? Sorry. You know, the one we heard about at Thanksgiving. What's-her-name. Put it this way. He'd better because we're going all the way to L.A. for the wedding. Imogen. Imogen. Barney Pierce, you are not seriously selling this place, are you? Well, I wasn't getting a lot of laughs, so I guess I am serious. Come here. Here, have a cookie. I hate to think of you leaving, period. But am I ever gonna say so? Excuse us if we look. No, come in, come in. This is the den. It's pretty small, not particularly well lit. But you know where you are in it...cornered. You are Barnaby Pierce, the comedy writer, aren't you? Sgt. Bimbo? Am I right? That's right. You know he is. We established that. Because it was totally my favorite show for a while. Is that the dining room? Is that a big round table with eight chairs around it? Yeah, how'd you guess? Let me tell you something. You were right not to be a salesman. You definitely made the right choice there. Dining room table's got a big burn in it! Dining room table's not for sale! Benjamin's getting married. I can't believe it. That's Christopher you're looking at. I know that. I remember Christopher so well. Has to be, what, eight years since the accident? That's right. So when do you fly? We're driving. Have you looked at a map? Because you're gonna find that Los Angeles is still situated right the other side of the country. You're driving? In the T-Bird. What? There and back? No, just there. We're giving the car to Benjamin as a wedding present. He always loved it. So did you, didn't you? You took me driving in it once. Do you remember that? I remember everything. Beautiful home. Thank you, thank you. Hi, Mrs. Pierce. Oh, Mrs. Biebel. Sorry we didn't get here sooner, but this Mr. Reed and Ms. Reinhardt I told you I was bringing. Hi. Hi. Barry and Tanya. We're Berry and Tanya. Hi. So, you're gonna drive, huh? Must be 3,000 miles. There's some people we wanna see along the way. After which you are seriously going your separate ways. Well, we're gonna take things one at a time. Really? Well, that'll be a first for you, won't it, Barnaby? Okay, Paula, okay. Oh, wow. I mean, seriously. Barry? Hey, Barry, listen. Welcome home. Please. I mean, do you know what I mean? I mean, truly, this is truly it for me. Lust at first sight. Could you work here, Tanya? Is this a place you could work in? Oh, Barry, I could work here. Oh, did you work here, Mrs. Pierce? I raised three kids here. Oh, kids, right. Oh, hi. Hi. We do want kids eventually someday, but I don't wanna stop working. Well, have three and you won't. You have three children? I didn't realize that. How great. Had. Oh, hello, Mr. Pierce. Jayne Biebel. I'm the realtor. Oh, are you going upstairs? You might find some people up there. Their names are Barry and Tanya who are very interested in the house, so... So I shouldn't tell them about the roof? Is that it? The roof? He's kidding. It's a living sometimes. I'm just gonna get a sweater. You think that'll shake their resolve? No. Great sense of humor. Oh, shit! Oh, I'm so sorry! Sorry. Totally an impulse thing. Haven't you ever done anything on impulse? We like it. We might make you an offer. They were in our bed? They were officially engaged in the prone position with the Lady Superior if that helps you picture the scene. What did you do exactly? I thought about the bedspread. Yeah, I thought about you and that Thai silk bedspread and how you'd feel if something happened to it or on it. Did it? No, no, it didn't, it didn't. And I tell you, I didn't wanna do this, but I checked. Nice people, huh? Oh, anyway, I spoke to Hal. Well, you're telling me now. When? Yesterday. I see, and you're telling me today. Well, you told me to call him, so I called him. He gonna be around when we drive to Denver? Yep. He wants us to stay with him a couple of nights if we want to. Oh, I can't wait. You know, it was your idea we go to see Hal and...Emily. Nobody is going to see Emily, okay, sweets? You are going to see Hal. He was your best friend. He wants to see you again just as much as he wants to see me. Listen, you told me to call him. So now you're acting like it's the first you've even heard of it just so that you can have the pleasure of looking at me just like that. Hmm. You fucked Paula, didn't you, in this house? I thought we were never gonna have this conversation again. You fucked her and she was my best friend supposedly. And have you noticed how nice I've been to her all these years? This is such old ground, Maxine. I can't believe you wanna fight about it! All the best battles are fought on old ground. That's what battles are about. Here. You know, it'd be so easy for us to just put the car on a train, fly to the coast and pick the car up there. Uh-huh. How do we get Griffin to your sister's if we fly? Well, we drive Griffin to my sister's and we fly to the coast... You just don't wanna drive with me all that way. That's what's going on here. Oh, come on. No, no, no, no. That's what's going on! No, it's not going on. No, no, no, no. It's okay. I'll drive. You can fly alone. I don't wanna fly alone. I don't want to be alone, Barnaby. You're asking for a divorce and you don't wanna be alone? What did she do that was so special, Paula? Did she do something I didn't? We're talking seven years ago. I bet she yelled. I bet she called you Barn. Did she? Yeah. Did she call you Barn? Yeah, that's probably why I dumped her. How many times did you use this room? You and Paula? Okay, one time. One time! And you drove up. I never should have told you. Shouldn't have given you the satisfaction. And don't tell me that that's the only satisfaction I ever gave you! Don't script me, would you, Barnaby? Please? I will drive the car, okay? You can fly all the way to L.A. alone! Do whatever you want. God, I never should have told you shit! Did you take her to a motel? Is that what you did? Did I ever ask you what you did? I hate those trousers with the elasticized waistbands she always wears. Never trust a woman who wears elasticized waistbands. They just do it to make it easy for guys to get their hands there! They do it because they're fat! That's why they do it! I'd like to drive. I mean, it's the one thing we never did, is it, from sea to shining sea. So now that it's too late, let's do it...Barn. So now that it's too late, let's do it...Barn. You drive and drive and it's like you're always in the same place. Only the names change. Yeah. East is east and west is east too. Well, no. We have snow and they have palm trees and development deals, sometimes. Have I lost you? Yep, I'm still here. Yeah, you and suburbia. Yeah. Both a bit monotonous, huh? Except for the war zones. Griffin, did you growl? You don't really wanna sell, do you? Does anyone? Well, I don't wanna be the prisoner of a house, Barnaby. It's humiliating. Well, if we're gonna give up everything that's merely humiliating, then how am I gonna make a living? Oh, don't tell me it's my fault you wrote Sgt. Bimbo. Of course, it's your fault! You are Sgt. Bimbo. Where else do I get my inspiration? Where else do I get my inspiration? Griffin? Griffin, what about here. Come here, come here. Griffin, Griffin, how you doing? Come here, come here, sweetie. Yes, you beautiful thing! Hi, sis. Hi, Nessle. How are you? Oh, isn't it obvious? Rich and powerful. You're looking great. Barnaby. Nice to see you. Hi, Calvin, how are you? Good. Good to see you. Hey, Cal, you look great. Barnaby. God is good. How's Randolph? Randolph! Randolph, come and say hello to your Aunt Maxine and Uncle Barnaby. I already did the last time they were here. Hey, look who's come to stay with us. Lunch in 10 minutes, Randolph. Isn't today a school day? Randolph quit. Quit? At 15? Come on. Oh, I love this kitchen. That old stove of yours... Yeah, you can have it. Oh, come on, Nessle. You have a beautiful life here. And what about you? Oh, I told you in my letter. What exactly was "separate lives" supposed to mean? In other words, you're getting a divorce. It means what it says, you know. I just feel like it's now or never. I wanna see if there's something I can do, you know. I don't know, something. Divorce isn't the main issue. You have such an enviable life. Not being grateful has to be a part of it, I suppose. Listen, I can't take comfort from other peoples' envy, Vanessa. Besides, I'm not looking for comfort. Seems like you must have had an awful lot of it. Is Randolph still cello crazy? No, he's into something else temporarily. What's that? Welding. Anyone know anything about acting schools? Uh, what do I do? Do I press a buzzer or something? I know something. Because I think I could be a great actor. Well, you could, for instance, act coming in and sitting down like a civilized person. You know the best quality an actor can have, which I've got? Couldn't be timing. Menace. Turnips? You're actually serving them turnips? You know, your sister's really scared of you, Maxine, in case you don't know that. She thinks you're so well-dressed, so . And see how shiny his face is? Think it's always that way. Uh-uh. He's afraid you despise him because, despite all the evidence to the contrary, he believes in God and also, possibly this could be the most crucial, he can't make babies like you, Barnaby. You evidently can. Randolph... Or could. Your mother says you're into welding these days. You've spoken to my mother? Oh, you mean Nessle. Yes, I am. It frightens her, doesn't it, dearest? The naked flame, the hot tip, the mask, the rush. He's absolutely right. He's gonna make a hell of an actor. Screwing going to be! I already have the first 15 years of my career behind me. I gotta go. Oh, Maxine? You know what? Just one more thing, okay? If you ever do speak to my mother, my mother, mother, check out whether she really is a triple murderer as is often alleged. You never know what's in the blood, do you? The talent in the corpuscles working quietly away until one day, out of nowhere, all of a sudden, for no good reason that anyone could think of, you just sing like Pavarotti or maybe wind up shooting a perfectly good dog. Timing okay? How do we live with it? We live with it. Griffin! Here, boy! That's not like him. Griffin, here! Griff! Griff! Randolph likes animals, doesn't he? Griffin? Griffin? Griff? Griff? Griffin, come on! Don't be so at home already! Griffin? Griff? There is a cello hanging in the barn. Y'all didn't say goodbye. Hey, forgot your Stetson, kid. Have you seen Griffin anyplace? Take me with you. Will you do that? I promise not to sing or dance. We can't even take Griffin with us. Look at it this way, Aunt Maxine. You could well be helping to avert a rural double slaying tragedy. You know what you should do, don't you, Randolph? Go back to the cello. I remember how well you played. I mean, it was truly promising. Take me with you or I'll smash this rock right through your windshield. Don't get mad, whatever you do. They're good people, okay? I'm not saying they aren't. But they're not good for me. They love you. Imagine I live with you and not them. Right away, I'm old and gray and contemplating suicide. Randolph, is that what you seriously want for Christmas? I love it. You see what I mean? You could write a part for me. Okay, you really wanna act? Yes. Okay, I can help you if I live that long. Do you wanna move the gun, please? Okay? Where's Griffin? He's checking out the cows and they're doing likewise. He's fine. I wanna dispel one illusion in case you seriously have it. Nobody suddenly sings like Pavarotti, not even Pavarotti. Listen, I can fit in back, okay? I wouldn't say a word. It isn't gonna happen. You're gonna go to school. You're gonna learn. Because, Randolph, knowing things, trust me on this, knowing things is part of how an actor prepares, okay? You're bullshitting me, okay, and I know it. Absolutely, and I'm right to do it. I can also buy that. Hey, hey, come here boy. Griffin. I'm gonna miss you. He'll be all right with me. I'll be back. I lied and I cheated and I got us the hell out of there. That's what I'm for, right? It's so unfair. You think so? Why did Christopher have to die, Barnaby? Why not Randolph? Think anybody would miss him? Is Casimir gonna have the smallest idea of who the hell we are turning up like this after 30 years? Maxine and Barnaby Pierce. We must be crazy. How good a teacher was he, anyway? Well, he was the only professor who ever meant a thing to me. I don't even remember anybody else's name. So we are here to get his permission to part is what we're doing, isn't it? I mean, he's still some kind of oracle after all these years and, even though we're not gonna raise it, he's gonna know and, if it's okay with him, then it's okay, is the case. Look at that diner. Johnny's. Is that what it used to be called? Isn't it Frankie and Johnny's? Guess they split up. Everybody does, right? So if he says that we should stay together, would that convince you? Green. Can it be? I've changed so little and you have changed so much. Hello, Casimir. I told her she should marry you and yet she comes to see me. How's Juliette? Juliette, she is out. I hope she left something for supper. We certainly didn't come in here to see you. I never wanted you to marry Maxine. I only said that. So she could admit that she was in love with you, right? That's right. As if it mattered. I knew you were never gonna dump Juliette. Oh, what's this? Has Professor Emeritus got a housekeeper now? Or a housekeeper masseuse? Hey. Terri? Hi. Here, let me help you. Thank you. I don't believe you have met my wife. Terri, this is Maxine. Hello. Hi. Hi. And this is, um, Barnaby. Hi. Pierce. I told you about Maxine, I'm sure. The favorite student you waited and waited for until another one comes along. Terri with an "i'. Well, I hope you're gonna stay. We're expecting you to stay. Come on. Come on. Thanks. Good, huh? Come. Great. Thank you. You know, isn't there still a Holiday Inn? Dinner is an imposition. No, no. Everyone stays. He likes when they do. Yeah. It feels so good when they finally leave. The kitchen's in here. You're embarrassed because of Terri. I'm sorry about that. Ah, I'm way past embarrassment. She's a good-looking woman. Congratulations. Yes, she is. And because of Juliette, 50-some years ago, I saved her from, well, whatever maybe wouldn't have happened to her, the beautiful Jewess and her smitten interpreter. You should write about that sometime. I only do comedy. This is a comedy. Laugh at us. What I was smitten with above all was my own vanity. Does that mean I owe her forever? To get a woman who wouldn't otherwise maybe have looked at me with such gratitude and worthiness, it's a comedy of some kind. Not for TV. So what happened to her? Juliette, when I told her the two big things I liked about Terri, she said just one word. Guess which? He wants to know what Juliette said to me when I told her about Terri and one word. Guess which? Finally. Barnaby? Your wife is a genius. Yes. That's why she's probably leaving me. So where is Juliette? Juliette, she... I didn't kill her. I'm gonna go see if I can be of any help. I can still lay a table at least. It's done. Maxine, okay. Can't you recognize a little tact, you know? Trying to give you and Casimir a chance to... How are you, hmm? Grandmother yet? Not that anybody's told me. No? It's nice to see you. It's wonderful to see you. I'm gonna go back and teach and study. Why? I wanna be a psychologist. At least I think I do. Really? Never too late to do something useless in your life. Teach what? Well, French was my major and they need somebody at our local high school. You always used to say I had a tres bon accent. You have a tres bon accent. You also had those black silk legs. Did a lot for your pronunciation. You disapprove, don't you, of me and Terri? You were always so proud of your marriage. Yes. I exchanged pride for what? Greed. Know the difference? Greed has tits. Oh, I hate that. I seriously hate that. What's happened to Juliette? Remember that? I remember that vase. I remembered it. Did you love it? Did you give a damn about it? Did I? Was it valuable? What's value? I had it for years. It's broken! Do you miss it? Or do you want me to miss it, hmm? How long you been with him? I've been married to him three years. Oh. Oh, that's pretty recent then. For you. Not for me. What does it mean, may I ask? Being married to him? Well, it means that I get his house and his money. Cas, we're eating! You don't like me for saying that? I don't necessarily like you for thinking it. What happened to his son? He went to Israel. Really? Why'd he do that? He knew he'd never meet me there. Israel? Don't you worry about him? No. Why should I worry about him? He's 38 years old and a nigger. If he gets sunburned, that's his problem. He's made the money to do it in safety. The king of plastic packaging never reads a book. The kid I always wanted. Do I worry about him? Casimir, you know what you are? Yes. I know exactly what I am. Sit down. Let's be comfortable. I am a shit. It was always my secret ambition to be a shit and now I've realized it. It is most men's-- isn't it? I haven't read the latest figures, but... Finally. What a weird meal. That terrible stuffing, pork. Then a great strudel. Yeah, uneven meal. Well, we're back in this room. I never figured that. You remember when we used to house-sit here? Yeah. I left my virginity somewhere in this room. You were so beautiful. Oh, were is nice. You haven't changed. Oh, well, that's my big mistake unless it's your big lie. It's my big lie. We shouldn't have done this. Oh, coming here, oy. In the first place, you mean? Oh, you know exactly what I mean. What the hell happened to him? The things you shouldn't do, aren't they sometimes the ones you should? That first time that we made love here, remember? Mm-hmm. It was Cas that you really wanted, wasn't it? Now that's a big lie. I never wanted Casimir. I wanted you. What happened to us, Maxine? Terri? Hello, Maxine. Jesus! Juliette? Now I get it. What do you get, Maxine? The strudel, why it was so good. What's going on around here? Well, he's a funny man. Funny? Not the word I might have chosen. Well, he was good to me. Why shouldn't he do what he wanted to do? Do you want a glass of water? No, I don't want a thing, not a thing. Do you still live here? Are you shocked? Well, why didn't you have dinner with us last night? Well, I never see them. Well, when did you make the strudel? In the night. I do a lot at night. I listen to the radio and, in the day, very often I sleep, I go for walks. I'm not a ghost. I have my life all to myself. You mean you literally never see him? Well, why would I see him? Well, doesn't he check up on you? You think he should? I'm so sorry. Well, I think it's very kind of Casimir finally to let me bury myself in his house, don't you? Can you imagine living in a house like that? Never seeing anybody? Easily. You know I'm never gonna find anybody like you. That's the one thing you have to be, don't you? The guy that never wanted any of this to happen? It's not honest, Barnaby. It's-- I don't blame you, but it's not. I did not invent this situation between us. You're probably right. It all goes back to Christopher, doesn't it, finally? I don't know what it goes back to, what Christopher goes back to...went back to. Plus Hal. Well, now that's when you started secretly being divorced, making preparations. You stopped telling me the truth. What I started doing was working in anger, in secret anger. Open comedy and secret anger, nothing quite centered. Making any sense? Too much. I'm sorry I did that to you, truly sorry. Always assuming that I did. Every time we get close to each other, we start to kick holes in one another's lives. Why do we do that? I think it's the only pleasure we have left. You know, the only thing that I said to Stanly was that we might be coming through Chicago, and he said, oh, then you gotta have a meal and stay the night, but I'm going to see him. Uh-huh. I do. I like Stanly. Yeah, I know. And the fact that Karen isn't with him anymore really doesn't make any difference whatsoever. Boy, did we laugh. When we did those two seasons on the Stinkinsons? And all those pilots. What's Karen doing now? Karen? Woof. She's gotta be in her 50s or something. Oh, well, she couldn't possibly be doing anything, could she? Oops. Oops. Boy, import enough Greek yogurt and you too can have your Rolls waxed. Hey, hey! Should we go get some flowers? You're gonna meet Glenn Gould. Oh, he already has the Gould. They got everything in the whole damn world. Why wouldn't they have the Gould? You're 20 years late. What happened? Traffic. Hey, Barney. How are you? You don't know. Good to see you. Good to see you. Hi, Maxine. Hi. So nice to see you. This is my sweetheart. At last. Hi, I'm Anthea. Anthea, hello. Very nice to meet you. You too. Cato? Luggage. Brung you a present here. Yes, sir, Mr. Tarlo. How lovely. You didn't have to do that. I know. Come on in. I'll show you your room. You can freshen up a little. Thank you. Chop-chop, Cato. Welcome to Casa Tarlo. Yogurt, huh? Thank you. Thank you, Cato. I was hoping you'd be bald. Or have some breathing difficulties. I have respiratory phlegm. So how's... Maxine looks great, by the way, just great. When did she not? How are the kids? They're fine. They're okay. We're on our way to see Stacy in Minneapolis. Uh-huh. And, of course, Benjamin is getting married. Congratulations. You know about Christopher. Yeah. We spoke at the time. We just keep smiling. Of course, in my case, that means I keep other people smiling. How do you like the pool? Fabulous. It's fabulous. You got a sailboat and everything. Okay, okay. Want something to eat? Drink? I'd love some water. Water? Come with me. We have a pleasant... Hey, do you ever see any of our old shows? I try not to. 'Cause I caught a couple episodes of "It's a Crime". Yeah? Do we get residuals on those? Why? You think you need the money? I could use it. Whoa, look at this place. Nice. Whole thing. So, you think Maxine looks okay? Oh, great. She looks great. Sadie, you look great. What's your secret? Well, to tell you the truth, Janie, I'm having an affair. Who's doing the catering? I wrote some really good stuff. My line? Me. Mine! Me! You two have been together for so long. What's to talk about? I know, I know, I know. Get you some water. Life is tough, huh? Yep-a-doodle. Here you go, buddy. To Barnaby and Stanly. Barnaby and Stanly. So Anthea lets you touch her whenever you want. She's a wonderful girl, seriously. I've never... It's the best I've ever had. She's a wonderful woman. She looks very sweet. You know, the sex is not the whole thing here. She's bright, she's smart. How is the sex? It's pretty good. I'm using Viagra now. Really? Do you use it? Uh, no. Miracle, miracle. I'm like vavoom-boom. Like MiracleGro. Yeah. Well, yogurt's been kind to me. I mean, I know you think it's pretentious a little bit, don't you? So what happened with Karen? What happened to Karen? Karen's living with another woman in Baltimore, Lulu. Which came first? Baltimore did. Lulu is younger than Baltimore considerably. No, no, no. Not a lot prettier. I mean, Stanly, do you think that you're responsible for, you know, Karen doing what she was doing? My lawyer says not. My lawyer says that I say not, but am I? Are you? Me? You fucked her, didn't you? What? Barney, she told me all about it. I never even kissed Karen! She never accused you of kissing her. This is a total and complete lie! Barney, a lot of stuff came up at one point and this was one of those things. She also fucked Buddy Schultz. Buddy, I knew about, but not also. See, it's not an also. Also never happened, never. Well... Stanly, you must have hated me. Is this why we didn't see each other? I would never hate you! You never come to Chicago. Well, you never come to New York? I never fucked her. I never did it, not once! You're my friend, okay? Why would she say something like that? Maybe she had wished that it had, assuming it didn't. You're my friend! I know I'm your friend. I come to your house. Why would you even think that? Why, Stanly? Why? Why? No, why, why? Why don't we cut the last why? It might help the scene. You know, if I just think of all the black lists that I could have been on, and this I never did. I never did this thing! Why don't we go see how those two gals are doing, huh? Ooh, in Baltimore? Not those two. Jordan and all that stuff. Petra. It's so dangerous now to go to the Middle East. Right. So, Anthea, would you do me a favor, hon? Put the Gould on. I'm dying to hear it. No, no, no. Don't put...no. You can do that anytime. Do Jerry Lewis. Jerry Lewis? What? Please, I don't wanna do Jerry. I don't wanna. She's never seen you do Jerry Lewis? No. Come on, come on. Oh, you have to do it. You have to do it now, Stanly. I don't wanna do Jerry Lewis! Do it for me. Do you insist? Do it! Do it! Okay. I'm the nutty professor. Hi, Dean. Hi, Jerry. Hi, Barny. Hi, Maxine. Hi, Anthea. Ooh! Stan, are you all right? Stanly, you're not dead again, are you? He does this. It's something he does. Hello? Stanly? Hello? Mrs. Biebel? I can't talk to you now. Stanly? Yeah, yeah. No, you're gonna have to call back. Stanly? What? Stanly? You've had an offer? Stanly? How much? We should get a doctor. Call 911! No. Forget a doctor. Call an ambulance or the medics. I call 911! Stanly. Easy. It's okay, baby. Oh, Stanly, I love you. Anthea, you know, they say-- I don't care what they say! I'm going with him! Let's go! Anthea? Anthea, we'll drive you. He's my husband, my husband. You fucks! This is all your fault! You know he's dead, don't you? This hasn't happened. This couldn't be happening. Am I responsible? I am. Oh, God. He never should have done the Jerry Lewis. No, he wanted to do it. He was dying to do it. That could be better phrased. Fucks. She doesn't want us here. We're the last people she's gonna wanna see when she gets back here. She's gonna hate us, Barnaby, for the rest of her life. He thought you looked great. You wanna know what happened to Karen? Oh, yeah. She's living in Baltimore with another woman. No. Lulu. I don't believe it. Lulu? Cato, could you help us with our luggage? Yes, sir. Why don't you give Stacy a call and see if she's home? Oh, shit. What? I lost my cell phone. You sure? I think I left it at Stanly's. I did. Use mine. It's in my bag. Anything in your life that isn't in this bag? What's his name? What? What's his name, the guy that lives with Stacy? Why do I keep thinking that it's Chesterfield when it's not? Davenport. That's why. Barney, make an effort, okay? 'Cause I think she's really in love with this one. Oh, I gave it to Cato! Son of a bitch! Boy, this is a crappy neighborhood. Do you think it's safe? Don't close the door. I gotta get the rug. Oh. Barnaby, wait a minute. What? What's the matter? Well, how are we gonna approach this? You know, how are we gonna tell her that... We don't have to say anything right away. It's all right. Right, 'cause you know how emotional she can get. Oh, darling! Oh, darling, look at you. Mother! Oh, my gorgeous girl! Oh, my God, now I understand. Why Minneapolis, huh? Oh, now I understand. You know this much! It's so beautiful. We're here for one minute and already I don't know anything. Here, this is for you. Ta-da. Oh, you bought that in India. I love that rug. We love you. That's why we want you to have it. Oh, God. You didn't have to do this. Oh, well, all right then. In that case, we'll just... Honey. Oh, thank you. Look at this kitchen. God, look at this stuff. How's your job? Well, I didn't get fired if that's what you mean. Why would I mean that? Why won't you level with me? What are you two really doing all the way up here? We've come to visit you. Okay, what about the whole truth and nothing but the truth? We now have lawyers instead. That's too true. No, we're going to Los Angeles, you know, for the wedding. Mother, what business am I in? Business? Yes, well, financial. Finances services, isn't it? Straws in the wind. I am hired to pick things out of the air and draw conclusions from them. Now you two come up here looking eminently polite with each other and you ring about as true as a Norman Rockwell. Plus, you give away your favorite rug. So what's happening? Nothing. Nothing. Were you finally planning on getting a divorce? Is that the situation? No! Yes. Well, hell. I am glad it is out of the closet, unfolded and out of the closet. Now let's drink some of this stuff in the newly cleared air. Don't you think you're being a little unfeeling? Taking it as easily as you are? No. I just want you to live a little, you know, now that's it's... Too late. Oh, but that's crap, Barnaby. Oh, well, that's two to one on crap Barnaby. Why don't I make it unanimous? We were afraid. No. See, I'm trying to dispense with those, the fear. You know, I'm trying to prove to you that contrary, I hope, to appearances that I am okay. I'm sane, you know. I've become sane. So I can confront what I know without panicky denial. I don't know if this is maturity resignation or evidence that-- I throw it open to the floor. Impressive maturity in my view. Cheers. Now it's my turn. A couple things that I have to say, the first being... You're pregnant. Yeah. Excuse me? You're pregnant? You're pregnant? Really? Oh, my God! Well, how long have you... last night? Oh, ha-ha. 10 weeks. Is Davenport as happy as you seem to be about this? Which bring us very swiftly and just as well, since we have a dinner reservation, to item number two on the agenda. He's ambivalent. You know, I have no indications about Davenport's feelings. He seems to have just vanished from our screens, but I wouldn't mourn exactly. Are we supposed to be happy that you're gonna raise a kid all by yourself? Look, I don't like the idea any more than you do, but, number three, luckily I won't have to. So come on now. Who is he? Who and where is he, actually? Okay, he's in TV. He's a sportscaster and a very, very good one too, very popular in town, as you will see when all the heads swing around as he comes in. Oh, cue! Here he is. The lucky man. I'm sorry I'm late, baby. My producer said he had something that would take only a minute and it didn't. It took 25. Hi. Maxine. Oh, my God. Ah, just what you expected, huh? Clifford Wordsworth. I have seen you play a couple of times, more than a couple. This is the guy. This character can score under pressure better than anybody! You're a hockey player, or what are you? Maxine, hockey players are rarely seven foot tall. You didn't tell them, did you? No. I wanted to surprise them. And see how they handle it, right? Yeah, they handled it pretty well. So you come all this way to Minneapolis to find out your one and only beautiful daughter is dating an ex-basketball player. She wanted to see us take it on the chin. So we've seen that. I need a drink. Raymond? Good evening, Mr. Wordsworth. It's always a pleasure to see you again. Yes, same with you. Can I have my usual, please? Certainly. Mother? Clifford is not the father if it's any kind of concern. Davenport left me a little something, but I'm not gonna remember him by it. Well, we never met Davenport either. Meaning you haven't met Cliff? Mother, Cliff. Cliff, this is my mother. No, baby. I think your mother is saying something else. She wants to know if the father of your child is white or should they brace themselves for the rest of the local news? That's not fair. I've played pro basketball for 10 years, Mrs. Pierce. What isn't fair is what you get away with when people aren't looking. Mother, he's putting you on. Because, as Clifford knows full well, Davenport was whiter than white. That's right. I'm relieved, personally that she doesn't have a history with black guys. Who wants to be a part of a reoccurring pattern, right? I feel the same way. Mm. Mm. I'm gonna have some more. Don't imagine Davenport as the bright shining son-in-law that never was. I mean, there were conspicuously despicable things about that. Have we ever asked for an explanation? Have I ever? Yeah, what about that burn on the dining room table? Oh, yes. I don't know. That was the subject of a prolonged inquest. That's true. Maxine, do you dance? Oh, please be advised. Mother always shakes her head to indicate yes. No, no. Well, you know, my one big chance. Well, yes, thank you. I will. You talked me into it. So I spoke to Benjie. You didn't tell him about the car? No, I did not tell him that you're giving him the T-Bird. He has no idea. He still thinks you're flying out to L.A. on Tuesday. I am so happy you guys are doing this. Well, he always loved that car. The divorce, I mean. Did it bother you that much? God, they really seem to like each other. God, they really seem to like each other. You shoulda seen her as a little girl. Oh, mother. You know what daddy always says. No flashbacks. I bet she climbed a lot of trees, huh? We had this neighbor, Paula, and she was over at our place one time when we were waiting for the fire engine to get you out of the sycamore tree, I think it was. She said to me, "Maxine, don't you ever wonder about Stacy?" Wonder? Wonder what? Oh, you know, like you should have been called Rick or Rock or something with pants on it. God, she was some sexy fatso on stage, wasn't she? Paula? Great tart. Okay, I'll tell you what it is I wanted to ask you. If it's a boy, which we don't know yet obviously, would either of you have any objection if we named it Christopher? Yes. Maxine? Well, I thought... Think again, would you? Mother? It's eight years. Yes, it is, over. You want me to tell you how many days over? Damn! You can always tell when mother is seriously pissed. She starts doing favors. You know, like I'd stay out later than I should and all my washing got done, even things that were clean. Oh, great. Maybe it'll be a girl. No, it's okay. Okay, you're really upset. No. You asked me a question. I answered. Nobody's upset. Meaning I now don't get my bedside rug shaken out? No, no. Look, I'm tired. I think I might go to bed. Do you wanna show me where everything is? Watch your head. Okay. Are you having a problem handling this? You know, me and your daughter? That problem? Stacy's been a big girl for, gee, over a week now. She always does what she wants. Do you always want her to? So what was the toughest team you ever faced? Aside from you and your wife? That's very polite. I think that's what it is because we're not very much of a team. And I'm sorry if we embarrassed you by coming here. Have we? No, no. I expected you to be white. You're very experienced when it comes to knowing how to say things. You're a big star. You play Mr. Modesty, but you're a big star and stars usually, I imagine, well, not just imagine, I know quite a few. Stars are used to, you know, getting all the girls they want and quite a few who want them and... Like that. Mr. Pierce, Stacy isn't girls. She's strictly in the singular like that. All right, I got an early day tomorrow. To be continued. So he doesn't mind the baby? No. He loves me. I know, I didn't entirely believe it myself at first either, but it's true. You know, at first when Davenport got so nasty, I thought I would just do what he said and get rid of it. But then, at the same time almost, I asked myself what I wanted and I knew I wouldn't. I realized that I wanted to have it and not him and, what's more, I damn well would. But are you sure? Are you sure that you want it because you want it, not because he didn't? Are you afraid people are gonna think it's Clifford's? Never occurred to me. Okay. So in your opinion, what should I do? You know the best advice a mother can give. Don't do what I did. And what did you do? Is that weaving from Guatemala? Peru. I thought so. Mother? I got rid of it. Then I married Barnaby. He thought he had to. I thought he wanted to. I was 28 years of my life. Well, that's neat, but that's not true. When did it happen? In college? Why else didn't I graduate? I thought it was true love. So did I. So did Barnaby possibly. Maybe it was, God help us. Can I bring him to Benjie's wedding? Clifford? Why wouldn't you? Stacy, don't, whatever you do, base your life on what you think your parents won't like. I mean, you'd be truly horrified if you ever found out how really open-minded we are. To the point of being glad to have a black son-in-law? Are you going to marry him? I don't know. I might just toy with him a little bit. No, I love him. What other ingredients are required before you marry someone? I don't know. I never clipped the recipe. After you married daddy, did you ever fuck anybody else just to have something of your own? Do you talk that way about your mother? I always suspected you did. Christopher did too. Hal Kressler? What about him? Does daddy know? Know what? Well, you may not have anything to hide, but you sure hide it well. I love you, mom. Goodnight. It's even better at night, huh? Fabulous, fabulous. You okay? The worst thing in the world has already happened to me, so I have no doubt that we'll survive. Frankly, I think her life will be shit without me. My life will be shit without her. Daddy, do you wanna do anything about this or not? What's to do? What's to say? I already said everything. You know who you remind me of? Who? Mom. Maybe I should just put all my money into some kind of trust fund for the children. Please, God, don't let 'em retire on the benefits. I think Stacy might actually marry him. Do you think it could work? Well, let's see. He's black and she's carrying someone else's kid. I don't see why not. Seriously, Barnaby. Well, how the hell do I know? He's happy, she's happy. Of course, so were we. Do you know what you should do, Barney? You should write something on spec. Write something. Something what? Not serious? I don't do serious. I didn't say serious. I didn't even say great. Just something for yourself. Because I can't be a great writer just because I'm suicidal. You know what I mean? Thank you. Enjoy. You should write your memoirs. Memoirs of a hack, so I can be my own "as told to". Who would read that? Well, Stan's been dead two full days. Anthea has probably been remarried by now. I know I shouldn't say that. Good-looking woman. Why don't you give her a call? You saying that you're not coming back with me? Is that what you're doing? We have to sell the house. Mm-hmm. So maybe I should call Mrs. Biebel. What time is it in the east? I don't know. What? 9:00? Yeah, it's too late. The truth is, I really don't want to sell and I don't wanna call Mrs. Biebel. I don't wanna sell the house. Well, just go back and live in it. God, I wish Stan Tarlo could see this. ♪ When Johnny comes ♪ Marching home again ♪ Hurrah, hurrah ♪ We'll give him a hearty ♪ Welcome then ♪ Hurrah, hurrah You think they're gonna have a stripper later? It's more than possible. These things usually start with a prayer and end with "take it off". Imagine actually being a stripper. Did you ever? No. No, I don't have the architecture. I don't have the kind of front that men lean forward for, you know? Like they drop something and they just have to work out where the hell it went. You did when you were pregnant. Oh, yes. You make my point, you bastard. Have you been deprived? Oh, you're a beautiful woman, Maxine. No, no, don't, please. No, no. Think of all the women in the world. That's what you were to me. What was Paula then, if that's what I was? Maybe she was a slice of turkey when no one was looking. What was Hal? What was Hal, now that we're talking about these things? A long, long time ago. And tomorrow. He is tomorrow now, idn't he? I know that they're baying at something. What are they baying on? Take it off! You know, there's some females who really get off on that kind of hunger, that rage, that desire. I hope you locked the door, Barnaby. Hey, Maxie. What? Oh, no, you don't. Don't what? You know. Oh, no, no, no. Thought I was safe in here. Come on, come on, come on. Stop it. Come on. Barnaby, no. Why now, why? What for? Why? Because we're strangers in the night. Because we've been together for so long. And it's not just a coincidence, right? What? That we're going to Denver tomorrow to see Hal? Look what you just killed. You just killed that, Maxine. You know, I used to lie there and ache for you to reach out to me and you didn't. What you never did was, you never laid in bed and knew that I was with someone else. and knew that I was with someone else. We don't have to go to Denver. We can go straight on to L.A. I won't care. Hal will care. You will care. Besides, we promised. Promises are for breaking. You know what's really terrible, for me at least? It isn't selling the house. It's selling our memories and they're never gonna know, the next people. They're not gonna see our ghosts. They're not gonna recognize the bumps and the scratches or what they signify. Oh, Barney. Oh, Barney. Oh. Oh, Maxine. Mr. and Mrs. Pierce? I'm Lynn. I'm Mr. Kressler's assistant. Right this way, please. Hey. Yes. Can I help you? I'll be damned. Well, you will if I'm on the jury. Well, you must have treated her right, Barnaby. She looks great. She looks wonderful. You too. That's us. Sporty, very sporty. I thought we'd, you know, go to the house. Emily wants to see you. Yeah. We wanna see her. Well, you have the address. But why don't you follow me? It'd be the simplest thing. Tell you what. Why don't you go with him? Barney, let's just try and get through this without... No. You wanna be alone with him. That's one of the reasons we came. Tell you what, Maxine. Why don't you ride with me? That is, if Barn doesn't mind. Okay. Whoa, whoa. Hal? Hal! We lost him. He'll find us. What if he doesn't? You have a cell, don't you? He'll call you and we'll give him directions. Or he'll call the office and Lynn will tell him... I don't have a toothbrush or any clothes or anything. He'll find us. Maxine, you have not seen the last of him, I guarantee it. Unless you want to have. So... Why do you still do that? You still say so... It's really going to happen, is it, this time? Well, I never said it was ever gonna happen before. I never remotely indicated that. So, why? Well, you know, Benjie's getting married and Stacy is too, so we're led to believe. She's with a black guy now, Clifford Wordsworth. The Clifford Wordsworth? Oh, there are others? Well, not for me, there isn't. God, he's one of the all-time greats. Yep. I remember Stacy when you had to go back and read her bedtime stories. So do I. That wasn't one of them. He's not gonna show up behind us no matter how many times you do that. You always used to say that we were a mismatch made in heaven, Barney and me...and I. Yeah, I remember saying it once, when you were getting dressed with your back to me. You always got dressed with your back to me like there was something I still shouldn't get to see. Even after we just fucked, you did that. Okay, so? I wanted to believe it. I needed to believe it. I needed to have you say you did, but did you? I think maybe I shouldn't have come. I don't think you ever thought you should. I remember one time when you came, instead of saying yes like most women do when they're happy, what did I hear you say? No! No! Oh, no, if we have to be accurate. I remember that. Yeah, I remember I was so shocked. I was so shocked, shocked. I thought I'd hurt you. At how great it was and how much I was gonna have to... Lie to him? I guess. I was terrified at how far away from home I was at that moment. I didn't even care about the kids. I loved you, whether you like it or not. I needed maybe to hear you say that a couple more times. I said it plenty! No, no. I mean about me and Barney being a mismatch. I didn't care about you and Barney. Fuck you and Barney! Fuck fucking, to tell you the truth. Because you know what I do in the scoring department these days, huh? I go down to Santa Fe and there's a number I have down there and I go see this woman whose number it is, maybe once or twice a year. She thinks I'm CIA because I told her so. That's what I do. And Emily? What about Emily? What about Emily? Yes. How about you get outta the goddamned car right now? What did I say wrong? You'll figure it out. Out! Go get your goddamned divorce! And how about you don't ever come back and tell me, huh? Emily is Emily. She always has been. You know it and I know it! Where am I? I haven't the slightest idea where I am. I don't know where Barney is. You'll work it out. You wanna know the last time Emily-- No, Hal, not in the slightest. Right after that letter you wrote saying you wouldn't be writing any more letters. Then. How long ago was that, huh? Huh? Eight years ago? It has to have been. Barnaby opened one of your letters and I thought by mistake. You thought so... That I was gonna stay married to Barnaby and, okay, we have to be serious about it. Okay? Fuck you! Fuck you, good and loyal wife! It was that or...it was right after Christopher was killed and I know that you need to be mad, but I needed Barnaby and he sure needed me, and I'm sorry. Christopher is... Don't say a word! Not one word, please! All right. Imagine some man who was once in love with a woman who was also in love with him. But, unfortunately, she was married with kids. And whatever they felt about each other, the man always knew in his heart that she loved her husband and her kids and that it was, okay, his duty to let her go back to them. He lived for the next umpteen years in the knowledge, so he thought, that he had done something, all right, noble, something that was right to do. He wasn't happy. He was not at all happy, but he had, he liked to think, some reason to be pleased because he had contributed to something valuable. It wasn't like that. Something good, something right! And then you drop in with your coy little smile and you say, "Guess what, folks?" You and Barnaby got it all wrong after all. How about that? And the answer is, get the fuck outta my car. And get the fuck outta my life! This is Barnaby's cell phone. Goddamn it, Barney. Why did you have to lose your goddamned phone? Hey, Halibut! Well, against all the odds, I beat you here. What happened to you? Where's Maxine? She got out. She got out? Where? Somewhere along the line. Wow. Where? Why? I told her to and she did. You told her to? Mm-hmm, and you're making it really worthwhile I did. What did you do to Maxine? When, in our long history, are we talking about? Where is she? She went shopping! You know, I always used to think I liked you, despite... but I don't. I really don't. Mm-hmm. Well, she thought you'd married her out of pity. She told you that, huh? Right after the abortion. Oh, she told you a lot of stuff. And that's why I got lucky with my best friend's wife. I got lucky accordingly with a hot little piece of ass. That's my whole life taken care of pretty well, except there's a kicker. There was one more squeeze to be gotten out of me and up you came to squeeze it. Hal, where did you leave Maxine exactly? She's the best I ever had. You tell her that. And I do declare, if she hadn't loved you so damned much, she would have sucked it right off one of those times. Is that what you wanted confirmation of? You have it. Been great seeing you for the last time, Hal. Have a happy divorce. I began to think you weren't coming. Here I am. Thank God. Can we possibly get out of here? There must be a way. ♪ Hooray for Hollywood ♪ That screwy ♪ Ballyhooey Hollywood ♪ Where any office boy ♪ Or young mechanic ♪ Can be a panic, with just ♪ A good-looking pan ♪ And any barmaid ♪ Can be a star maid ♪ If she dances with ♪ Or without a fan ♪ Hooray for Hollywood ♪ Where you're terrific Unbelievable. Barnaby Pierce, the great Barnaby Pierce! Gary. How are you? I live and breathe. How are ya? Gary, this is my wife, Maxine. I don't believe that you two met except on the telephone. Maxine, how are you? You look great. Hi. Nice to meet you. Gary and I worked together a long time ago. He produced a TV pilot that Stan Tarlo and I wrote together back in the old days. Never saw the light of day. Well, what are you gonna do? You wanna get a coffee? There's a coffee shop. We'll go get a coffee? I can't. I'm not checked in yet. So what? So I can't charge it to the room. What? I'm gonna go buy you a coffee and then I'm gonna stiff you? What, you've changed? When have I ever stiffed you? The final payment on "Sherlock Holmes in Manhattan"? Why don't you two guys go and have a coffee and some fun? You'll get ready, you'll come and join us? Sure. Coffee and fun. Yeah. I like that, if only we could, huh? Just have your signature, Mrs. Pierce? Yes, thank you. Uh, you know what? Two coffees, mine decaf and skim milk. Throw in a couple of Danish. Yes, sir. Same thing for me. No skim milk, no Danish. Very good. Huh? Stan died. Stan... Stan Tarlo. He died. Did you ever see his Jerry Lewis imitation? I don't know what Stanly Tarlo looked like. He died right in front of my eyes. So you gonna see people while you're here? No. I was just gonna hang out in lobbies and places. I guess I'm just here on a kind of vacation, you know, thinking of writing my memoirs. No, no, don't. Be advised, don't unless you fucked a lot of famous broads or you swindled a lot of people real good, i.e., real bad. Mustn't do that. What do you think about gothic? Gothic architecture? No. I'm developing a series for cable, American Gothic. What is that? Decaf? And that's skim? Yeah, just put the Danish. So it's halfway between Edgar Allen Poe and Hawthorne with a smidgeon of The Addams Family in there someplace. So I'm looking for quality writers who really wanna do something a little bit imaginative. That's code for low budget, right? You know what, Barnaby, seriously? Co-produce it with me. You don't need me, okay? And I'm not really here. That's Marsha Kapinski. Gesundheit. No, no, no. Marsha Kapinski is a real player. I got a 12:00 with her. Um, that explains why you look like you're ready to go down on her in public. Doing a remake of "Rebecca" together. Also, "The Birds". Totally different concept. Much more ecological. I gotta go. You know what else I'm doing? Lady officer in the Marines. I'm thinking of calling it "Officer and a Lady". You ever catch up with "Officer and a Gentleman"? It's like that, only better, different, better. I'm outta here. All right. Apologize to your wife for me. Why? What did you do to her? Excuse me? Didn't, what, steal her purse or anything, did you? Because I can cancel the credit cards. You know what, Barnaby? You're sick, okay? Just like that. You should see a doctor. You should see one. Why, when I can see a shit like you? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay, I get it, I get it. No. I get it. No! Listen, only you're so wrong. Barnaby, Barnaby, this new series has nothing to do with Sgt. Bimbo. Kathy is an officer. When did I ever steal an idea? The last time you had a good one. Marsha Lapinski? Kapinski, huh? You have a 12:00 appointment. Yes, I know. He's a thief. Excuse me? He's a thief. Next time he tries to fuck you, watch your purse. Now you wait just a minute. I could very well call someone over here right now. That's exactly what you need to do. Barnaby? You should tell someone. Clearly, you're insane. Hey, good to see you! Hey, this must mean you're out of the joint. Drunk or on something. Gothic? Yeah. Okay, all right, okay. Who was that? Oh, you know what happened to me? Do you remember-- no, you wouldn't remember-- Stanly Tarlo? Great, great comedy writer. Tarlo, no, I don't. My friend. He worked for me. Mother? Mom? Wow. Hello, darling. You look... Stop it. Stop it. All right, okay. How are you? I'm good, very good. Now, as Barnaby's still busy with Mrs. Biebel just finishing up... Biebel? Yeah, she's the realtor. Can I help you? Hi. Yeah, a glass of chardonnay, please? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Mrs. Biebel? Yeah. Oh, you know the house. The house, right, okay. It's not important, but what's gonna happen with all our stuff in the house if and when you sell it? Anything you want shipped out, we'll ship it. Okay. I was thinking mostly my things. Sure. Okay, some of Christopher's, but not that I covet them. It's just I don't want them thrown out with the garbage. Here you are. Thank you. You're welcome. Thanks. Cheers. Cheers. Mom, what are you gonna do really? First off, I'm gonna enjoy this week. I'm sorry if we didn't make it clear to you about your things, other things, unless Stacy wants them. It wasn't callousness. It was just the opposite. I'm sorry. What's the opposite? Squeamishness. Okay. It's not Barnaby that I need to be distinct from. It's what happened in the house or what happened while we were in the... What are you talking about for starters? You know what I remember the most? I remember being so afraid to be happy again. I wanted the pain so bad that I grew numb with it. But I knew I had to pretend to smile for you and for Stacy and Barnaby. So it got to the point where, you know, I doubted my sincerity just about everything, you know, and my own secret feelings, you know. I faked to myself too or I thought I did. Yeah, something I was a little too proud of doing, just a little too proud, I guess. Is she pregnant? Is that what you're telling me? Who? Imogen? No. God, Mom, no one's pregnant. Stacy is. Yeah. Wow, I know, I know. Do you know about the guy? Clifford? Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. I mean, I know who he is. Oh, everybody does, except me. I thought he was a hockey player. A hockey player? Do you wanna have kids, though? Yeah, assuming Imogen can still go on with her career, of course. Oh, yeah, she should, I guess. Yeah, I'm sure. Was there some reason you wanted to see me? How about 'cause you're my mother? Hi. Can I help you? Barnaby Pierce to see Benjamin Pierce. Look at you! You look... Listen, I want you to meet my boss and we're gonna go wrestle with a bit of pastrami. Great. Pastrami sounds good. Let's go. Show you around a bit. Fabulous. This is the boardroom. Boardroom, okay. Coming up here, all right? Check this out, check this out. Benjamin... If there's time, we'll come back. It's not big enough. Come in. Marsha? I would like you to meet my dad. Oy vey! No! This is your...Benjamin. Oh, my. Well, Ben, I have to tell you your father is a crazy man. He says very, very weird things to people in coffee shops. What is this? You two already know each other? Yes, intimately. Your father confided to me that Gary Pereira was a thief. And when was this? When was this? Yesterday morning. Really? Yeah. Didn't Gary tell you that I was an old lush named Pierce? No. In fact, he said he didn't know who you were. Oh, bless his loyal old heart. It really is just so amazing to me. You can't even imagine what kind of a shadow you cast around here. Thanks. You know, Ben, we should get your father to do something for us. Yeah, oh, yeah. Well, just give me a hoop and I'll roll right through it. All right. Well, I'll keep my eyes open. Nice to meet you. Great to meet you. Have a good lunch. Can I say something? Sure. All right. Forgive me if I'm wrong. Forgive you if you're right. But that's about as far as I'll go. If you and mom are not parting at this point, why do we have to hear about it? Because we wanna be up front with you. You know, you and Stacy are adults and we didn't wanna spring it-- Oh, see? That is exactly what you're doing, and now you're going back on it. We have handled it badly. I'll give you that. Oh, yeah. But it's not like we did anything intentionally. And why are you so concerned? Well, you think it doesn't matter to me? Dad, it matters to both of us. You've already talked to Stacy about this? Not at length. Because when we talked to her, she was very, very calm about it. She was very... Stacy. Of course, she'd be. What I think is going on is that you feel threatened by the uncertainty. And that's so unreasonable? No, no. Now you can imagine how I feel. So what is it? You guys don't love each other anymore? Is that it? No, not exactly. Look, I don't wanna blame your mother for this. I don't wanna blame anybody. If I wanna blame someone, I blame myself. But what we don't seem to love, what seems not to be loved enough or not too much, is we don't seem to love being with each other. You don't have sex anymore. You know, there are some things that I don't talk about with my children, Benjamin, no matter how dated that might be. Meaning? Keep going. Meaning I don't wanna have this conversation with you, okay? I find it aggressive and obnoxious. Christopher. Christopher what? Is what it's all about. It's what everything is about. When they called you from Colorado to tell you that there had been an accident, what exactly did they say? They said that there had been an accident. Dad? Dad? Oh, shit, Dad. Hey. Don't look at me. Are those people you work with? It's not important, Dad, please. Alternatively, I could ask you here and now in front of everybody what the fuck is it that you wanna hear from me? I guess what I don't wanna hear, Dad, is what I wanna hear. Which is? They said somebody was dead. Did they not say that? They said that there had been a fatal car accident, yes. And that they were afraid that our son... Dad, when it happened, you didn't know, did you, which one of us it happened to? They said it was the driver. We knew it wasn't you. You were 15 years old. Christopher would never have let you drive. Benjamin! No, oh, Ben. You know, I always wished I could ski like him. and I know that you wished it, too. We don't compare our children. You compared them. Of course, you compared them because I heard you and mom sometimes. This is your guilt. This is your way of being able to accuse. This is survivor's guilt, Ben. Christopher's dead and there's not a day goes by that I don't wish it wasn't so, and for some of the reasons that you might actually be thinking right now, that, yes, your mother and I might have had a different life, but he is. And here we are and I don't believe a damn thing came of it. They talk about coming to terms with these things. You know... There are no... You can get some help. Terms. I don't want any help, Benjamin. I don't want consolation. Okay. There is no consolation. And whatever you may be hoping or fearing or whatever you think might be in your head about what we wished or what we wish, you're here and we are very, very glad that you are. I know. Oh, there is one more thing. What? This is yours. I don't believe it. Just drive carefully, okay, for God's sake? With the power vested in me by the State of California, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Way to go, Ben! So far, so good, as they say. They're a handsome couple, Barnaby. More than handsome. You know what I feel about your son. I feel he's a good man. It doesn't hurt too much giving our daughter to his keeping. I take it your own daughter is pregnant. Congratulations. Thank you. You know what they used to say about those sort of things in the Navy, Barnaby? There's good news and there's bad news. The good news is that you're gonna be a grandfather and the bad news is that, from now on, you're gonna be sleeping with a grandmother. Oh, that's so funny, Barnaby, funny, funny. And have you met one that you like yet? I know one who I think has reason to like me. You know what your trouble is, don't you? Yes, I do. I never work on spec. I just don't have the balls. I guess. How much have you been drinking? Do you know-- do you know what I really didn't like was the fact that you were so goddamned brave. You know, you seem to cope with pain so much better than me. Really? Oh, go on. What? Go on. After Chris died... After Chris died and you gave up Hal and came back to me and tried to make it work, do you know that all I could do was hate you because you coped so well and I couldn't? You were so great with Stacy and Benjamin. Well, I knew you hated me. And what did I do? I fucked Paula. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You deserve so much better than me. I know. There just doesn't seem to be anybody. Don't think I didn't ever love you, Barnaby, because I did. I do actually. Sometimes. Come on, Griff. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome.
