(idyllic music) - [Philip] Careful! - Hey! What else did you have a supper? - I'm afraid we had meatballs, but they weren't very nice so you didn't miss much. - I think was hard of Aunt Margaret to send me to bed without any supper! - But, you really were awfully rude to her. Don't you think you ought to say you're sorry? - No. - What if she keeps you in tomorrow? - Why, what you going to do? - Well, I was thinking, if we're gonna spend such a lot of time in the woods this holiday, we really ought to have some sort of a naturalist headquarters. - A what? - A place to keep pencils and paper for our bird watching. - We could keep a little store of food as well. - [Philip] Oh, Ruth! - I've got a tin box we can put it in. - [Philip] You're always thinking about food. (door creaking) (clock chiming) - Good night, Ruth. (Ruth fake snoring) So, we're still going to be naughty are we? (Ruth fake snoring) Very well. Good night, Philip. - Good night, Aunt Margaret. (door creaking) - Philip. - What? - Mustn't tell Aunt Margaret about it. - Why not? - Because she'll only find some silly reason for stopping us. Oh, Philip, when can we begin? Can we start tomorrow? We'll rush through our holiday jobs. I only have to do the dining room and living room. It won't take long. (lively music) I'll be good as gold, so Aunt Margaret won't keep watching me, and before she can think of any other jobs for me to do, I'll just slip out. Oh, we can easily get away without her seeing us. Oh, Philip, you haven't finished yet! - No, it'll take ages to do all these. - [Ruth] No it won't! Quickly, put them in the shed, and pretend we've done it. - Can't do that! - [Ruth] Of course we can, come on Philip! - Ruth? Ruth? Ruth, where are you? You haven't finished yet! Ruth, come here! (playful music) (sheep bleating) - [Ruth] What, with spring bursting out everywhere, there was just no stopping us. Poor Aunt Margaret didn't know quite what had hit her. She had agreed to look after us while my parents were in India, but I think by this time, she was regretting it. (lively music) - Not in the doorway, silly. See if you can go and find any other that way. (birds chirping) (bird squawking) Ruth! - Over here, quick! Pheasant! - How did you find them? - She just flew out at me. She tried to knock me over. - Gosh, aren't they lovely? Come on, we better go, in case they get all cold. - They're lovely, fluffy little chicks. - But once they've hatched out, they will be lost within a day. And do you know what? If we keep a watch out, we might even see them coming! - Oh, do you really think so? How exciting! We must come keep an eye on them every day. - Hmm, but we must be careful not to disturb the mother too much. - We might actually see them coming out of the egg! - That one there on the left. - [Ruth] What would we use it for? - To take bird pictures with it, of course. - You mean, like the pheasants hatching out? - No, they'll be hatched out within a few days. It'll take ages to buy the camera. - Well, how much have we got now? - I don't know, just over a pound, I think. - Oh brilliant! It won't take that long to save. I'm sure it won't! I wish we could have it now. Do you think the eggs will hatch tomorrow? - Maybe, I don't know. They could come any time. (dishes clattering) - Oop, finished? - [Ruth] The next morning, I was still living in a dream. All I could think of was to be there at the nest when the chicks hatched out. - I hope you weren't planning anything this morning, Ruth. - Why? - I've got a big wash to do, and you can help me by turning the ringer and pegging out the clothes. - Oh please, I must go out today! This is something very important! - What is? - (sighs) Not fair! - Ruth! - All Philip has to do is chop wood. I have to dust and clean and do the washing as well! I especially wanted to go out today. - Well, you can just do what someone else wants to for a change. And, if you can't do what you're told cheerfully, you can stay in this afternoon as well. Really, you're getting more lazy and selfish every day. I don't know what's coming of you. (melancholy music) (ringer cranking) Come on, Ruth. You have to do it a bit faster than that. We'll be here all day. Alright, come on. Come along! I'd be quicker doing it myself. Look! Hold on. Let's now, come on. Let's keep. Come along now. Keep moving. - Are you coming yet? - No, she's not. Come along! You're going to make yourself useful for a change. You can run along and play by yourself this morning, Philip. Ruth will join you this afternoon, if she behaves herself. Sooner your parents get back from India the better, but heaven only knows your mother is going to be disappointed you when she does. It's alright, alright. Just leave it. Take these things outside and peg them up. Oh, Ruth, really! Look, leave it, leave it, Just take these things outside and peg them up! (crows squawking) You silly obstinate little wretch. I think you better go before you do any more damage. You're more trouble than you're worth in this busy morning. And, if you've got any ideas for the next few mornings, you can forget about them, because you're staying in until you learn to be a little bit more pleasant and a lot less clumsy! Go, off with you. Oh! - Ruth, Ruth, it's come! I watched one of the eggs hatch! When I got there she flew off and this egg was cracked, and could see the membrane heaving up and down. I didn't stay in case they got a cold and died. I nearly finished the wigwam. All we need now is to really start back and to cover floor if'n it'd be perfect. Someone's in there! - Who? - Well, I couldn't exactly see, but I think it's a boy. - Well, whoever it is, you better get out, 'cause we want to go in. - You'd better come out! - Perhaps it's a dead body. - No it isn't, I saw it scratch itself. (Ruth laughs) I think I'd better go in and look again. Perhaps he's deaf. I say boy, this is our wigwam and we're coming in, so you better get out. - Shan't. - Then I shall pull you out. - [Boy] Then I shall cut out of the wall and bring it down with me. - I know, let's have a tournament. If I win, you go away, but if you win, you can ... We'll share the hut. - You leave him alone while I knock that tough out. - Come on, Philip! Come on, Philip, come on! Come on, Philip! Earn the wigwam! - Alright, stop it! You won. - Beat you along. Now, I won't be seeing you out in any case. Could build a better one meself. - Would you like to see a pheasant's nest? - What, that one down there? I could show you 'alf a dozen of them. - Do you know lots of nests? Could show us any more? - I could show you well nigh every nest in this here wood. - Come on, let's go, show us them all! - Alright. (lighthearted music) - What's your name? - Terry. - Where do you live? - At a cottage in the 'ollow, down Tanglewood's way. - [Philip] Have you got any brothers and sisters? - [Terry] No, it's only me and my mum. - Where's your father? - I ain't got none. - [Ruth] Who were you collecting flowers for? - My mum sells them in the town. She's a flower seller. There, there's one of your pheasant's nests. - Oh! Gosh, there are four eggs in here! Hey, come have a look at this! There, oh no it's gone. - Ruth, you shouldn't make so much noise. What was it anyway? - I don't know. (idyllic music) - Are you coming again? - Don't forget your flowers. Bye. (birds chirping) - Hey, hip. Hey, hip. Hey, hip. Hey! - Hello, Mr. Tandy. - Hello, heh, heh heh heh heh. Well then, Ruth, and how are you hey? - Very well, thank you. We just built a wigwam over there by the pond. - By your farm there? Well, I know that. And, who's we? - Me and my brother Philip, but he's hurt his ankle today, so he had to stay at home. - Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. One of my sheep has lost himself, and I'm thinking maybe he's got stuck in some of these bushes somewhere. You can stop and help me find him if you like, hmm? Come along. Hey, hip. - Have you always been a shepherd? - That's right, always have been. Let's see through there. Hey, hip. - And, why does it stray? - I expect he's like the rest of us. He likes his own way. And, his own way has got him into a deal of trouble, poor little chap. - Well, I expect he's over it now, all caught up in the bushes, and wishing he'd stayed in the meadow. - Yeah. Takes a deal of thorns and briars to teach these lambs is their own way innit the best, heh. He'd be crying his heart out for me somewhere, if only I could find the place. - And, no one to find him. He has strayed a long way, hasn't he? - Ah, I'll find him. I never yet had a lamb stray, but what have I found him and brought him home. Hip, hey. (sheep bleating softly) - What is it? Can you hear him? - Aye, that'll be him. Ugh. You know you're around, do you? I keep thinking where are you? Hey ... There, there you are you little rascal, heh. Wanted your own way, didn't you, eh? Come along, eh, eh, eh, hold still hold still. Come along, we'll soon have you home. Heh, hey, hold on then. Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey. That were a foolish thing to do, wunnit, hey? (chuckles) You ready to come out now, are you? That's it, come on. (idyllic music) That's it, yep. - [Philip] What, me leg! - Ah, sorry. - That's one pound ... What was it? Two shillings and a penny. Oh, it'll take ages to buy the camera. - No it won't. We've got a shilling more than what we counted last time, so we're getting on. - But, it's so slow! I just as soon be a grown up. And, I expect I should be sent to boarding school, and there won't be much chance to take pictures. I wish Aunt would let me be an errand boy, or something I could earn more money at. Just think what a beautiful picture that pheasant would have made, and the eggs hatching. - Oh, Philip! I've had the most marvelous idea! - What is it? - Why don't we pick flowers and sell them? Like Terry's mother does. - Oh Ruth, Aunt Margaret would never allow it. - She needn't know, we won't tell her. (car honking) (lighthearted music) (both laughing) - What's it mean? - I don't know. Sounds like a man who sells hawks. Anyway, it couldn't be us. But, you'll have to be awfully careful about laughing. (doorbell ringing) (Ruth snickering) Shh ... - Well? - [Philip] We picked some flowers. - We thought you'd like to buy some. They're about six pence, I think. - Unless you think it's too much. They look a bit dead. - [Ruth] They will be alright, once you put them in water. - [Philip] Because they're really quite fresh. - Little boy and girl, didn't you read the notice? - Yes, but I'm not a hawker. - And, I'm not a circular. - If you are too young to understand English language, then you are certainly too young to be doing this sort of thing. Go home to your mother. (melancholy music) - [Ruth] Uh, excuse me. We're selling flowers. - Hmm? - [Ruth] We wondered if you wanted to buy some. - Hello. Is this how you earn your living? - No, not really. We wanted to buy something very particular. We thought we'd sell flowers. Nobody seems to want to them though. - Nonsense, blue bells are my favorite flowers. I'd give anything to have a scent like this. There you are my dear. - I don't really think they cost that much. - That's alright, it's been a pleasure to meet you. You must come and see us again sometime. Good bye. - Good bye. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. (birds chirping) (knocking at door) - [Philip] Would you like to buy some flowers? - Come here a moment. I'm sure we would like to buy some. - [Mrs. Sheridan] They're all much the same. I remember when my own children were little. They could be so trying. - [Margaret] Oh yes, but the little girl, Ruth that is, is so very unruly. I shall be only too glad when her mother comes and takes her off my hands. - Come on. - Let me see what you've got. What usual flowers, where did you pick them? - By the stream. - By the stream? I might have known these were grown by water, and I shall certainly buy a bunch. Fetch my purse, will you, Isobel? And, give these two children a scone before they go. Come along, they're very nice scones. (suspenseful music) (Ruth shrieks) - Philip! What is the meaning of this? (all gasping) - Oh, pick them up, the mess is all down all over the carpet! You didn't get startling. - Oh! - Oh! - Oh, it doesn't matter, please don't think anything about it. Quite, it was quite an accident mess. - Well, does Mrs. Sheridan get an apology for this disgraceful behavior? - I'm most awfully sorry for spoiling such a lovely tea party. I didn't mean to. - Oh, never mind. After all, you didn't do it on purpose. - And you? What have you to say for yourself? - No! I'm not a bit sorry. We weren't doing anything wrong! And, nobody said it was disgraceful 'til we met you! We should go on doing it if we want! You always spoil everything, Aunt Margaret! (melancholy music) - Ruth, I'm not going to punish you, because it doesn't seem to do much good. But, I've been thinking things out on the way home. I don't seem able to manage you, or bring you up as I ought. You have 10 days more holidays, and then if they can take you, I'm going to send you to boarding school. Your mother suggested it at Christmas, but ... I wanted to keep you then. It will be a big extra expense, but anything is better than having you growing up as selfish, obstinate, and ill-mannered as you are now. - I shan't go. - [Margaret] You won't be asked. - [Ruth] Very well then! I shall run away and I shan't come back. (melancholy music) (heavy breathing) - [Margaret] And, if they can take you, I'm going to send you away to board school. - [Ruth] Very well, then I shall run away. - [Margaret] Your mother suggested it at Christmas. - [Ruth] Very well, then I shall run away. Very well, then I shall run away. (church bell ringing) (children and animals chattering) (melancholy music) - Going to send you away to boarding school. Very well, then I shall run away. Boarding school, they'll send you ... I'm running away. Boarding school, they want to send you to boarding school, away. (birds chirping) (rooster crowing) Philip? Philip! (rooster crowing) (door opening) (footsteps tapping) - Come on, there's no need to be frightened. No need for you to hide. I don't mind little children coming into my church. But, I, I was a bit surprised to find someone here this time of the morning. - I couldn't help being here. I came in last night when the door was open. Fell asleep by mistake. - [Father] Do you mean you've been here all night? Whatever is your mother thinking? - It's not my mother, it's my aunt. I wouldn't have done it with my mother. - Don't you get on with your aunt very well then? Why is that? - She just doesn't like me. She likes Philip, 'cause he's so good, but she always tries to spoil everything I want to do. - You know, Ruth, grown ups aren't perfect. We sometimes say things we don't mean. We sometimes do things that are wrong. You know, maybe, maybe your aunt finds it a bit difficult looking after you and Philip, and I shouldn't think you're all that easy either to look after. What are you going to do now? Do you really think that your aunt would send you to boarding school if you went back to her? Do you like it? - Reminds of a shepherd at home. He lost one of his lambs and was looking for it. I went too. You know, we wouldn't have found it if it hadn't started crying, Mr. Tandy heard it, and there it was all caught up in the bushes. It couldn't get out. The poor little thing had strayed an awful long way. - That was a daft thing for it to do, wasn't it? Got itself in a whole pile of trouble. It reminds me a bit of you. - What do you mean? - Well, you looked cold and lost when I found you in my church this morning. You'd run as far as you could. You didn't want to go home. You were stuck. And, you don't know what to do now, do you? (melancholy music) Do you know who that shepherd is? It's Jesus, the Good Shepherd, and we're, we're like the sheep. We all run off, do what we want to do, and it lands in us trouble, sometimes much worse trouble than you're in, but like your friend Mr. Tandy, the Good Shepherd doesn't forget us, and all we have to do is, is cry out. - Then what? - I know you can't see him, but he's here now with you and me, waiting for you to be found. If you ask the Good Shepherd to go home with you, he will, and he'll start to mend things for you. - If I did, would I always be good after? - No, no, not always, but he would always be with you. Oh, Ruth. He loves you so much. You know all those naughty things you said to your aunt, and all the time she was angry with you, he's taking all the hurt from that on to himself, so that he could say to you, come on, Ruth. Put all that behind you. Make a fresh start. I think it's wonderful. Don't you? (idyllic music) - Dear Shepherd, I am sorry for keeping you waiting so long. I have been ever so naughty. Please help me. The man did say you would help me. He said I could be like that lamb in the picture, if only I asked. Please let me be your friend. (birds chirping) Please help me. Even if I have to be punished, help me. (door rattling) (somber music) Oh, I'm sorry, Auntie! I'll try to be good! Please don't send me away to boarding school! I'll never, never run away again or be naughty. - Well, I don't want to send you away if I can possibly help it. We'll try again, shall we? (idyllic music) (Ruth shrieks) - Oh, Terry! - Terry, what are you doing? (laughing) (playful music) - Terry! - Hey, Ruth ran away last night. - Ha, why? - She had a quarrel with Aunt and was going to be sent to boarding school, but it's alright now. - Good for you! How'd you like to see a wood pigeon's egg? - Yes! - I found a nest with two beauties in it. There's another tree beside it, and if we build a platform on that, we can watch them hatch out. - Wait up! - If we keep below the point, so that we don't disturb the mother. Here, give her a hand up, will you? Come on, up you go. Can you see them? - Yes! - Hello! Gosh, look at that! - Why don't they fall off? - I don't know. Wood pigeons nests are always like that. - [Terry] I've got a better place to watch the eggs from. - It'll never hold you. - Terry, be careful. - Woo hoo! (Ruth shrieks) (Terry laughs) Woo hoo! - Terry, don't do that! (Terry laughs) (limbs creak) Terry! (Terry screams) (thudding) (melancholy music) - Ruth, I'm not quite sure, but I think he's alive. We shall have to fetch someone to carry him. I think I'd better go, because I can run faster. - [Ruth] Dear Shepherd, please make Terry better. Don't let him die. - Ruth? - Hmm? - Do you think he'll die? - [Ruth] No, I don't. - Why not, did he say something to you? - No. But, you see, when you went to collect the others, I prayed to God very hard that Terry would get better, so I expect he will. - So did I. I said, oh God, please don't let Terry die, all the way home. I don't know whether it'll be much use. I'm not a very good boy. I usually forget to say my prayers. And, when I do say them, nothing much really happens. - But Philip, look. (lively music) You don't have to be especially good to be able to pray. You just need to belong to the Shepherd. I didn't make it up. The minister told me when I ran away. It's in the Bible too. When you're naughty, you're like a sheep, which has got lost and can't find its way home. Then the Shepherd comes to find you, and when you ask him, he finds you, but he always waits until you ask him. - What Shepherd? - Jesus. Then we belong to him, and he listens to everything we say. - Did you ask him to find you? - Mmm, on my way home in the woods. I asked him to forgive me for being naughty, and to make me one of his lambs. Oh, Philip, I just want you to belong to him as well. - Do you think I could? - I'm sure you could. I'm sure you'd be ever so easy to find. You're so much gooder than me. I'll show you a picture. You see, it doesn't matter how naughty you are. See the sheep? It's there down the cliff and so lost, but the Shepherd still found it. - Could I ask him now? - Yes. - Then I'm going to my bedroom. I shall have to be alone. We'll talk about it tomorrow in the morning. (idyllic music) - [Ruth] Aunt, Mr. Robinson has invited me to tea on Saturday. I can go, can't I? Oh, do say yes. - Who's Mr. Robinson? I've never heard of him. Ruth, you mustn't visit people without first consulting me. - [Ruth] But, he's quite alright, Aunt. He's the minister I met the other day at church. He said he'd write you a note. - I should hope so, but I'm afraid the answer will have to be no this time. Miss Montgomery called yesterday to say that her little niece was coming to stay, and I said you would play with her on Saturday. Oh, I'm sorry, but perhaps Mr. Robinson will invite you another time. - Oh Aunt, you know I hate going to tea with Miss Montgomery. And, I hate that Julia Montgomery. She's like a little mouse. She can't play anything nice. We have to stay indoors and play dumbells, and I hate dumbells. Aunt, please say I needn't go. Anyway, I told Mr. Robinson I could come. - But, you've no business to tell Mr. Robinson. I've never heard such nonsense. You must never accept invitations without my permission, and stand still while you're talking. You're making me quite dizzy. - I won't go. I will go where I like. I told Mr. Robinson I could, and I shall darn well go, and you shan't stop me. - Go straight upstairs to your bedroom, and don't let me hear any more of this rudeness. I thought you were going to improve. This doesn't look like it to me. - [Ruth] I don't care. - Go on, off you go. (melancholy music) (Ruth sobbing) What is the matter, Ruth? It's not worth crying about. What's the matter? - It's the Shepherd. I've lost my temper. Perhaps he won't let me come back to him. Or, he isn't going to come back to me if I'm good next time. - [Margaret] What are you talking about? - That. You see, I was a sheep, but I lost my temper so badly. Oh, Aunt, do you think he'll forgive me, just this once? - Who gave you this picture? - Mr. Robinson. He told me all about it. You do know the story don't you, Aunt? Oh, won't you think he will, if I never do it again. Do you think he might? - Well, if you're really sorry for being naughty and are determined to try to be different, I'm quite sure God will forgive you. You better ask him. - You do know the story, don't you? - Oh, yes. But, I used to know it much better than I do now. Still, I'm glad it's been of help to you. (idyllic music) (birds chirping) - All the way through that summer, we went to the woods nearly every day. Poor Terry had been taken away to a special hospital in a city, where they were trying to make him better, so we probably didn't learn as much as we would have with him, but there were so many things to see. I'd read all the way through Luke's Gospel just as Mr. Robinson had suggested, and got to know so much more about the Good Shepherd. I think he had started to make things better with me and Aunt as well. She could be really good fun. Aunt Margaret. - Hmm? - You know the big shop in the village next to the post office? - Hmm. - Well, in the window, there's a lovely little camera and, Philip and I have been saving up to buy it. - What on Earth would you do with a camera? - You see, we've been doing this book. We thought if we use photographs instead of drawings, it would look better. - My dear, these, these are beautiful. When did you do them? - Oh, we've been doing it for ages. Philip did the drawings and I colored them in. - [Margaret] These are absolutely beautiful. - [Philip] Ruth, we've got a letter. - Who from? - Don't know. - Oh can I open it? - Yes. - Dear Philip and Ruth. I am come home but has to stop in bed. Please come and see me, from Terry. My address is Willow Cottage, the Hollow, Tanglewoods. - [Mum] Go on, you'll find him in there. - Hello, Terry. - I've been waiting here all day for you. - We came as soon as we got the letter. Did you enjoy the hospital? - It weren't bad, but I got a bit browned off with nothing but all those streets to look at, and this place ain't much better. - When can you get up? - I don't think I will. They I think I don't know it, but I heard them talking about it in the hospital. - Oh, Terry, they wouldn't have sent you home if you weren't better. - Could we bring some books? - I ain't much good at reading. - We've got lots of picture books. - Have you got any with birds, with trees and everything? - Yes, lots of them. - That's what I really miss. - Why don't we take your bed outside? - It, it won't fit through the door. And, you can't lift me, 'cause my back hurts too much. - Don't you find it cold in here? - A bit. - Why don't you use more blankets then? Haven't you got any more? - That's none of your business. You, with your fine clothes. I suppose you were the two that were with my Terry when he fell out of the tree. Well, you shouldn't have let him do it! What am I supposed to do with him in this condition? The doctor says I gotta keep him warm, give him hot milk to drink, they said. Where I'm supposed to get the money for things like that when I gotta stay here and look after him? (somber music) - It's only a haypenny. How much is there? - One pound 74 pence. - Oh, haypenny. - If both of us saved our pocket money for the rest of time, we could buy the camera for the Christmas holidays, but on the other hand, if we gave Terry 10 shillings, we could still buy the camera for the Easter holidays. - But, 10 shillings sounds an awful lot. Couldn't we make it seven and six? I'm sure he could get a nice blanket with that. - I was thinking of giving more. - More? - Good Shepherd gave everything. He gave his own life. (suspenseful music) - [Ruth] Perhaps, I could give him my picture. - Would you mind if I gave you something as well? Upstairs, there's a room that's hardly ever used these days. Do you think Terry would like to stay there? - The guest room? - It's, it's light and airy, and looks out over the woods. They're lovely this time of the year. - It's a beautiful view, isn't it, Terry? Do you like it? - It's smashing. Ruth? - Hmm? - Do everyone go to be with the Shepherd? - I'm not sure, really. I think perhaps you have to belong to him, and that's quite easy. All you do is have to be found, like the sheep in the picture. - [Terry] I don't like this picture very much, Ruth. - Why ever not? - I'm not sure. There's something about it that bothers me. I, I keep wondering whether the sheep has gone too far, and that the Shepherd might not reach him. - But, Jesus can reach anywhere. No one could ever stray away so far from Jesus that he couldn't bring them back. It's really quite alright. - What I'd like, is a picture of that sheep, after the Shepherd has picked him up, when he's safe, with him carried home. That's what I'd like. - Would you? I'll try and get you one. Anyway, I'll see what I can find. (idyllic music) Oh, Mr. Robinson? - Hello, Ruth. - Mr. Robinson, oh hello. Do you remember that picture you gave me? - Indeed I do, I remember it very well. - Well, I want the next one. Do you think it would be possible? - You mean another picture by the same artist? - Oh no, I mean a picture of what happens next, after the Shepherd has got the sheep safely in his arms. You see, it's for a friend of mine. He doesn't like my one very much. It makes him feel the Shepherd might be able to reach the sheep. - I'll try my hardest. - It isn't fair, I got sent in today for spilling ink on a girl's skirt. - Which girl? - That silly Julie Montgomery. (whistling) (cat meows) - When I got back to them-- - Oh, hello! - Hello, Ruth, come in, come in. And, as you know, the one thing I'd forgotten, was the cabbages. Anyway, Terry, I've brought something for you, but I didn't want us to open it, until Ruth had got here. - Okay? Mr. Robinson, it's lovely. Where are they going? - [Mr. Robinson] He's taking him home. - Where's home? - It's where the Shepherd lives. Would you like me to read you something about it? What it's like there? (idyllic music) And, God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain. - No more pain? God, that'll be smashing. Can anyone go? - Yes, anyone, anyone who belongs to him, anyone who comes to the Good Shepherd. (melancholy music) - [Ruth] Just a few weeks later, when autumn had turned to winter-- - [Mr. Robinson] Come thee blessed children of my Father. - [Ruth] Terry died. - Receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. Grant this we beseech thee, oh merciful Father, through Jesus Christ, our mediator and redeemer, amen. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us all ever more, amen. (melancholy music) - Oh there, little one. (Ruth sniffles) Hey. What's the trouble then, eh? Is it your Terry? Hmm ... I heard about that in the village. 'Twas sad for you. - I prayed so hard he'd get better. Didn't do any good. God didn't even listen. - Hmm. Little'un, if you would have come to me and say, there's a little lamb down there yonder who can't run about on account of the pasture being so steep, and the stones so sharp, hmm. I used to go down there, and pick that little lamb up in my arms and carry it to another pasture, where the grass was sweet, and the ground more, well, easy like. You wouldn't come to me and say that I hadn't aided you, would you? No. You see, the Shepherd took his lamb home. That's all. You've no cause to fret. - But, it didn't seem like that at all. They buried Terry in the Earth, and we left him there. It seemed so sad and lonely. But, how could Terry be with the Shepherd, when we left him lying in the Earth? - Hmm hmm. He is. Here. You see this conker, hmm? Well, what's gonna happen to it, eh? And, what's gonna happen to its shell, hmm? - Well, it's shell will probably get covered and wither away, and the conker will grow into a chestnut tree. - That's it. You couldn't have said it better. Now, when you see that chestnut tree blowing in the wind, you're not gonna fret about its case withering under the leaves are you? - No. - No. Then, cease to fret about what's laying in the Earth. 'Tis only the case. Your Terry is growing strong up there, with his Savior. That's the truth. You think about it little'un. Hey, you be alright for getting home, will you hey? Of course you will. That's a good girl, heh heh heh. - [Terry] No more pain. God, that'll be smashing. Can anyone go? - [Robinson] Yes, anyone. Anyone who belongs to him. Anyone who comes to the Good Shepherd. - [Tandy] Your Terry is growing strong up there, with his Savior. (idyllic music) - Philip! Philip! (birds chirping) (water rushing) Philip! Philip! Philip! Philip!
