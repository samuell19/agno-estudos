(THUNDERCLAP) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (WIND HOWLING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (THUNDERCLAP) (TIRES SCREECHING) NEWSREADER: And so, at midnight, just twelve minutes from now, mass murderer Victor Ajax will be executed in the Hudsucker State Penitentiary. - (PASSING CAR HONKING) Now it's Ajax's turn to die. For Ajax, a Security Systems repairman, it's death by electrocution, thus writing finis to the horrible tale of murder and mayhem that shocked our fair city just two weeks ago... - (ENGINE REVVING) (TIRES SCREECHING) ...claiming innocence to the end, but nothing can save Ajax now. (TIRES SCREECHING) (DOG BARKING) INMATE: You... No... - GUARD: Sit down! - INMATE: Wait! Wait! No... no... no! (PANTING) - (METALLIC CLUNK) - Oh! GUARD: Okay, Joe. - (BUZZING) - (SCREAMING) They just fried Gurwitz. GUARD: You're next, Ajax! But I'm innocent! Innocent, I tell ya! Don't give them the satisfaction. GUARD: Ajax! Well, good luck, kid. Give my regards to Gurwitz. GUARD: Come on, pipsqueak, we're savin' a seat for ya! - (RAUCOUS LAUGHTER) - (WHISTLE BLOWING) Say, you look like a couple of reasonable fellows, and... so let me explain what's... what's goin' on here. I'm not supposed to be here! (SOBBING) It's all a big mistake. There's no hard feelings on this end, for mistakes do happen, and, naturally, I can explain everything. See, I only worked for Mr. Odegard and Mr. Trend. I was an employee in their security shop, and Mr. Odegard wasn't a very nice guy, and... - INMATE: Don't sit down, Vic! - (MULTIPLE INMATES LAUGHING) I guess he was plannin' to sell the shop right out from under Mr. Trend's nose... ODEGARD: Hmm... Hmm. RENALDO: So, tell me, Odegard, do ya L-O-V-E love it? Could ya die? Does it, er... trip your alarm? Frankly, Renaldo... what you do with this shop after you've bought it... doesn't interest me in the least. But let's keep this little transaction to ourselves. I wouldn't want my partner to know he's losing his business. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Oh, yeah? Watch this. (LAUGHING) VIC: But, somehow, Mr. Trend must have found out about it. (SHOES SCRAPING) (DOOR CREAKING) (VIC GIBBERING) Mr. Trend wasn't such a bad guy, but he and his wife had sunk their whole lives into that business, and... and... Mr. Trend would have done anything for his wife. Anything. (ECHOING THUDS) (PHONE RINGING) (LIFTING RECEIVER) FARON: Center City Exterminators. Trend? You there? Nobody's home. Give me the word! Come on, ya pipsqueak. TREND: Do it tonight. He'll be working late... alone. And make it quick. I don't want him to suffer. You hear that, Arthur? He doesn't want him to suffer! Awww! (TWO MEN LAUGHING) Helene, I'll never let that rat destroy our happiness. You can count on it. (MUTTERING PRAYER) (GIBBERING) So... So, you see... I had no idea Mr. Trend was up to something. N... Nobody did. It was between the two partners. I... I had nothing to do with it! (FLASHBULBS EXPLODING) If you could only find Nancy. She's my witness. If you could only find her, she'd tell ya I'm totally innocent. She'd tell you, the whole time, I was across the street from the shop, installing the video security system in Mr. Trend's apartment building. NEWSBOY: Extra! Extra! Read all about it! - (SIREN BLARING) - (HORN HONKING) - MAN: (WOLF WHISTLING) - WOMAN: Take your hands off me! - (SNAPPING FINGERS) - (BEEPING) - (LIFT DOOR PINGING) - (CHUCKLING) Mr. Trend! TREND: Honey, I'm home! (CLATTERING) Who is it? Er... it's me, Mr. Trend. Oh, hi, Vic. What's on your mind? Ah. Ah. Ah. Silliest damned thing. It's a broom closet! - (TREND LAUGHING) - (VIC CHUCKLING) Well, one more camera, Mr. Trend, then it's back to the shop. Fine, back to the... You know, Vic, I'm glad we ran into each other in this amusing fashion. For a long time now, I've been lookin' to have a heart to heart with ya. You know, you've always been more than just an employee to Helene and I. Honey, I'm home! You find this work fulfilling, don't you, Vic? And how, Mr. Trend! But have you ever thought about the grand design? I mean, there's something missing. Isn't there, Vic? Um... er... A door, Mr. Trend? What's behind the door, Vic? Oh! (CHUCKLING) Oh... oh, jeez... Mr. Trend, I'd love to have a foyer, but on my salary a large apartment is... I'm not talkin' about the anteroom, Vic. I'm talkin' about the little princess inside. Lord knows I'd do anything for Helene. Don't go back to the shop. Take the rest of the day off. Tonight you go out and find a little princess that you'd do anything for. Now you go out there and find yours. Oh... Thanks, Mr. Trend. Just make sure that... she knows who's boss. - Okey dokey, Mr. Trend. How are you tonight, Colonel? Adequate. One mother-lovin' hell of a storm brewin'. Know how I can tell? No, how? - Steel plate. - (METALLIC CLONK) In my head. Yes, sir, Korea was no picnic. Word of advice, son, when you hook up 4G, don't flirt with the filly that lives there. She'll slap you quicker than you can say ..."present arms". - (ARM CLICKING) Yes, sir, there's one woman that can take care of herself, all by herself. - (LOUDLY BLOWING NOSE) - All by... Hmm. Taking care of yourself. That's important. But two people, taking care of each other, that's romance. Romance... Let's see. "Chapter One: The Perfect Woman." (CHUCKLING) Of course the perfect woman's not just gonna walk into my life. Gee... (WIND HOWLING) (BRAKES SCREECHING) (HORN HONKING) Holy moly! Oh, my goodness! Are you okay? That temper! I tried to run. Why don't you take the cape? FARON: Come on, toots, get outta the road! (TIRES SCREECHING) You maniacs! That was incredible. I've never seen anything like that. - Oh, my jewels! - Are you all right? Oh! Oh, it's... Oh, you've got the key. - (KEY CLATTERING) - Whoops! (HEADS CLONKING) (INAUDIBLE) One more thing, Joe. Don't you ever call me a maniac. - (HEAVY THUD) - Ooh! (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) FARON: People gotta learn to watch where I'm goin'. Are you all right? Yeah... Are you all right? Me? Yes. Yeah. Excuse me? What? Oh, I... I... I thought you said something. No. Ah. (CHUCKLING) You didn't? Er... no. (CHUCKLING) Well... thanks again. (CRASHING) (REGULAR CLATTERING) VIC: Oh! (CHUCKLING) Um... would you... like to have some lunch some evening? I'm sorry, no. Ah... or a cup of coffee? No, no, really... - I, er... - I mean, I'll pay. No, that's not it. Really, I... Well, look... - If you're not hungry... - (BRAKES SQUEALING OUTSIDE) Maybe we could just chat. - RENALDO: Hey, hey! - (HORN TOOTING) VIC: I've got the rest of the night off, and... NANCY: Renaldo! Hiya, cupcake. Say, where were you? I had to walk home from work. Oh, I, er... Oh, I ran into an old army buddy, and I was detained. - Hi, I'm Vic. - Mm-hmm. - (SIZZLING) - VIC: Ow! Glad to know ya. Say, what the hell, in the neighborhood, whaddaya say you and I go out and... drown a coupla olives, huh? - (SNAPPING FINGERS) Well, I don't know... you... It's a date, then. Eight o'clock, Rialto Café, huh? Well, okay. (GUNSHOT SOUND) Socially, the man's a genius. I wonder if he's read this book? - RENALDO: Bye, baby! - Goodbye, Renaldo. Goodbye! (HORN TOOTING) Um...

(SQUEAKING) (BOTH HUMMING TUNELESSLY) - (LOUD SLAMMING) - (SCREECHING) (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (SCREAMING AND LAUGHING CONTINUES) (THUNDERCLAP) TREND: Helene, please come away from the window. HELENE: Is that Mr. Odegard's car down there? TREND: Honey, this roast is absolutely delicious. Is Mr. Odergard working late tonight? No. He went home... to eat his dinner. He was very hungry, and he went home. Well, it looks like there's a light on down there. (NECK CREAKING) Helene, your food's getting cold. He's still there, honey, and it's after seven o'clock. (LOUD CRUNCHING) I didn't know he was still there, honey. I didn't know that Mr. Odergard would be working late tonight. Wait... I think somebody's with him. I'm going down there! Get away from that fucking window! (ENGINE REVVING UP) (SCREAMING) (GIGGLING) TREND: I'm sorry. I'll go down. You can't go out in this terrible weather. Don't call anybody. I'll see what's goin' on. Remember what I said. Didn't expect him in the shop tonight. It's a complete surprise to me. Total surprise. And... (DOOR CLOSING) - (RENALDO LAUGHING) - (LIVE JAZZ PLAYING) You'd like that, wouldn't ya, baby? (HARD SLAP) A thousand guys would give a thousand bucks to have dinner with a girl like that. And just look at that guy. I'm not that kind of girl! Well, with a little practice you could learn to be. Oh, now, now, wait a minute, cupcake. (NANCY GASPING) (LAUGHING) Nice tie. Ooh! Seventy-six dollars! Okay, here's forty. We'll pretend that I had the appetizer. We'll call me a sport. I'd call you a heel! So, I'm a heel. So, what of it? Who are you? Maybe I'm just a guy who hates heels. Maybe I'm a heel who hates guys who hate heels. Oh yeah? Well maybe I'm a guy... (HEAVY THUD) - (CLATTERING) - (MUSIC STOPS) (GROANING) Ow!

Go on! Go on! What in the livin' hell am I doin' here? I oughta shove those binoculars down your throat. Jiminy cripes, how'd I ever get myself into this? - (UNLOCKING DOOR) - For cryin' out loud. So long, partner. Nobody makes a fool out of Ernest Aloysius Trend. Now everything's hunky dory. No witnesses. "Why, no, officer. "I couldn't say where he is. "Enemies? "None that I knew of... know of. "Yes... "Donald was very much beloved by all. "Of course, I'm sure he's all right. "Murdered?" (SIZZLING) (LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY) Mm-hmm. Yeah. (DIALING) (PHONE RINGING) HELENE: Ernest, is everything all right? TREND: Can't find him. He's not in the shop. - Are you sure? - Well, now he's gone. Maybe he went out for a bite to eat, and used the back door. How should I know? Okay, then come on home, honeykins. Your dinner's gettin' cold. Okay, I'll be right home, dear. Goodbye. (LOUD CRACKLING) (YELLING) (MANIACAL GIGGLING) I used to think that the key to happiness was the installation and repair of small electrical appliances, but... well, I don't claim to know a whole lot about the grand design, but... lately, I haven't been able to shake the feeling that somethings missing. And I'm not talking about the foyer or the anteroom. (CHUCKLING) "'Cherish' is the word I use to describe "all the feelings that I have hiding here for you inside. "I don't know how many times I wish that I had told you. "I don't know how many times I wish that I could hold you. "I don't know how many times I wish that I could mold you "into someone who could cherish me as much as I cherish you..." I haven't seen you here before. I like that in a woman. You're cute. Ooh! Keep talkin', baby. Maybe you'll tell me somethin' I don't already know. - (THREE GUNSHOT SOUNDS) - Pow! VIC: "...don't know how many times I wish that I could hold you. "I don't know how many times I wish..." (METAL HOSE CLANGING) FARON: Arthur... (CRUNCHING) Ow... For all we know, this is the guy that hired us. Mmm. Tell him it's a two-for-one sale. (GIGGLING) (BOTH LAUGHING) So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that... the perfect woman is... is pretty much in the eye of the beholder. Strange how some dames dig ground chuck, when they could have prime rare. WOMAN: Oh, you man, you! No-one can be perfect on their own. Each person needs someone to believe in them, to see them as being... someone special. People shouldn't be afraid to take care of each other. Nancy... Today, when I saw you fall, all I wanted to do was take care of you. (SNAPPING FINGERS) Hey! I thought... How did...? When did you...? Gosh. (HARD SLAP) Wow. RENALDO: Listen, I'm the only one who can do it. - WOMAN: Oh, baby! - You know, I amaze myself. Ha! Yeah, that's right. HELENE: Ernest Aloysius Trend, what on earth is keeping you? Oh, the cab? You'll pay for that. I don't wanna break a hundred. (CHORTLING) (SIZZLING) FARON: Take your bag, sir? (CHUCKLING) No muss, no fuss. Leave the bagging to us.

COMPÈRE: Haha! Let's have a big round of applause for Johnny and the boys. Vic? Would you lend me thirty-six dollars? Sure! If I had thirty-six dollars. (CHUCKLING) I don't usually walk around with that much money on me. So where on earth am I gonna get thirty-six dollars? - COMPÈRE: Ladies and gentlemen! - (DRUM ROLL AND CYMBAL CRASH) The winners of tonight's Rialto Dance Riot will receive thirty-six dollars!

Rat ain't been made what can get away from Mr. Yarman. - (FARON GROWLING) - (CRASHING) See? It's a long road that's got no end. FARON: To catch a rat, you gotta find him first. Right!

"Some night"? It couldn't've possibly been worse. I almost get run over, lose a dance contest... (CHUCKLING) Get stood up by a heel, and spend most of the evening washing dishes to pay for a good time I didn't have! It couldn't possibly have been worse. You met me, didn't ya? Exactly. I think things could have been a lot worse. (VEHICLE APPROACHING) (LOUD SPLAT) Look at the bright side. You and your bright side? There is no bright side. You're not being rational, Nancy. Of course there's a bright side! No bright side. No bright side. No... bright... side! (YELLING) No bright side! Nancy, I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Oh!

Open up, please. It's the police. (LIFT PINGING) COP: Where'd you get the negro, Butch? Elevator. What kind of paranoid schizo could kill a man in cold blood, and then jelly up his face with shaving cream? My dad! Son? (CHUCKLING) NANCY: Aah... Ooh... I don't know what I ever saw in that heel in the first place. (RIPPING CLOTH) Oh, he's not such a bad guy, just a little confused. Am I confused, too, Vic? No, Nancy, I think your emotions are wonderful. I wish I could be as expressive as you. You were so free when ya kissed me in the restaurant... and when you slapped me. I think you're wonderful. (GULPING) I... have to get some more Sudzo for that dress. I'll be right back. (FLOORBOARD CREAKING) Vic? (MIMICKING VIC) Mm-hmm? I've just been thinking about what you said, and it's very sweet, but the truth is... I haven't been completely honest with my feelings about you. Thank you for helping me tonight. No problem. Of all the men I've known, none of them would have done what you did for me tonight. Gosh. I just want you to know... I think you're a very wonderful, and a very special person. (HIS OWN VOICE) It's not often I get a chance to meet a girl like you. (MUFFLED SCREAM) Nancy! Where are you? Freshening... (COUGHING) (MIMICKING NANCY) Freshening up! Sounds like that congestion's moving to your throat. Listen, I just saw Mrs. Ellroy in the hall, and she said that there are a couple of maniacs running around with forks in their noses, and she's concerned, because she hasn't seen Jack or Jack junior for, er... for quite a while. ARTHUR: Gracious. Yeah, it sounds like they're a couple of real sickos. Do you hear that? There's a couple of maniacs running loose out there. Oh, God. VIC: I know you can take care of yourself, but, er... I just thought I oughta pass it along. Well, tonight certainly has been rough on you! (CHUCKLING) But, I... I just... have to tell ya, Nancy, for me... it's been the most wonderful night of my life. (SHATTERING) It probably sounds funny to a girl like you, Who's met lots of swell guys, and... I know that'll sound funny to a... a girl like you who's... who's met lots of swell guys, and had lots of wonderful evenings. But, I never met a girl like you before... But I... I've never met a girl like you before... What a turkey! I know I don't deserve you, but I just had to tell you how I felt, before I... walked out of your life... forever... Take a hike, pal. You could tell me to stay, if you wanted to. But, if you don't... I'll understand. I understand. (DOOR CLOSING) I think he's gone. Listen, I just have to get a chance to tell you before we go. I really love your décor. It's a terrific place you got here. (SNIFFING) Oh, golly gee, your hair really smells terrific. Ya know, I don't get a chance to talk to people that much at all, especially girls like you, ya know. When I was in school, my mom used to never let me talk to anybody, ya know. And I hated my mom. That's why I got into the rodent business, ya know. Every time I kill one of those guys, ya know, I see my mom in their face, ya know... I never had a chance. 'Cause, you know, I'm, like, a product of the sixties. Ya know, Vietnam, napalm, "LBJ all the way". Ya know, Kent State, pay the price, Soul on Ice... - (CLANG) - (FARON GROANING) - Mrs. Trend? - Mmm-mm! Mmm! You better get back to your apartment. There are a couple of maniacs loose in this building. FARON: "Maniac", huh? (SCREECHING) I told you never to call me that! (HEAVY THUD) Arthur! Do you have a rodent problem? Hey, Arthur.

Some maniacs are after my girl, and I wonder if you'd let me take your... Do you love her, son? (WHOOSHING) Yes, sir. I reckon I do. She sticks a little in third. I don't claim to know a whole lot about the grand design... but those fellows are gonna suck on some abuse! (THUNDER RUMBLING) (TUNELESS SINGING) FARON: Arthur, go ahead, go on. Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't. FARON: Go ahead, take one. ARTHUR: No, no, I know you don't mean it. Arthur, I'm tellin' ya it's okay. Yeah? - Go on. - Okay...

Kill him! - Look out! - Nancy! (ARTHUR SCREECHING) You broke my shocker. Mister, you've done some bad things, and I'm gonna deal out some swift justice! - This one's for bothering my girl! - Ow! This one's for giving me this! Ow! This one's for ruining my date! (HOWLING) And here's one for all the folks everywhere! Okay, son, I give up. Please don't hit me again with that baseball bat. I realise what I did was wrong, and... well... I'm... I'm sorry. Sometimes, "sorry" isn't good enough. Wait! From now on, I'll be good. I swear it's the truth.

So, you see, I'm practically a hero. Oh, thanks. So, if it hadn't been for me, there's no telling how many people those maniacs might've killed. Tell it to Saint Peter! Saint Peter? Oh yeah, that's a good one! (LAUGHING) But seriously, if you can just find Nancy, she'd prove everything I've told you. Nancy, Nancy. You probably killed her just like all the others. She's alive, I tell ya. She was on the bridge. I don't know what happened to her, but maybe if you ran a picture of her in the paper? Ah, sure, yeah! We'll run a picture of her. - Yeah! - Yeah. - Next to your obit. - (BOTH LAUGHING) Yeah! Next to my...
