For thousands of years. Several Arabs sailed through Africa. West in Zanzibar. And taking with them. Carpets and other materials. Returning to Africa with trade from the east. Time passed. On a three thousand mile journey, starting with your ancestors. For previous generations. Upon arrival. They thought they were blessed. Then they started to celebrate a traditional prayer song. Not a long time ago. The slave trade was in force. Black gold from Africa. Primitive tribes taken from their homes to serve palaces across Arabia. Leaving your real intentions in doubt. The very long slave trade. And now ivory. The struggle for African gold invaded the continent. And in Africa today. We find what was left for centuries. The influence of these horrible disasters. This is the story of how it affected a small tribe. The Gelanas. On here. Away from it all. They have lived for centuries. A happy village that no one knew existed. Now, your land is dead. Their soil has been contaminated. And with him were their crops, food and their lives. In previous days, they used techniques to maintain strong pastures. Leaving them as new. Now white men say how they have to do it. Then a big meeting is called. They had no choice for a new land. And as always. The young and the old did not agree. Bosses were poisoned by their children's malice. Envious and greedy. Is that what you're talking about for us? Stay here? We're starving. Time is running out and we decide we have to go. How nice. You can learn to deal with buffalo. It will make everyone open their minds. Maybe you should open yours. All the time for the boss is not enough now. Watch. You have dominated us for many years. What do you see? Where should we go? I'll tell you where to go. They all go to the hills. - We're listening. - I want to help them do their best. The land is good there. Just waiting. A soil rich in water. Just work on it and I will help you. They are singing the wonderful dawn that falls on the coast. In Mombasa, what you call civilization. They are not ready to live in that civilization yet. The time has come for your decision. Welcome to your parents' traditional life. Get me that vase. Each man will put a grain in each pot. The red will be for moving to the hills. Or the black, being of change for the coast. Open it. You can continue for me. - I want to follow the vote. - Yes, mrs. It's enough. We will see the result. It is none of my business what you have decided, sir. Payton. We cannot interfere with work. I think they will have to go to Mombasa. They decided. For Mombasa we will go. Bob, don't take this wrong. Either way, they would have to move. We will then go to that location on the coast. Mombasa. If we look from behind. This is a paradise. The settlers were excited. Every tribe was happy with the new one. When I said goodbye to some members. I decided to go back to my work. Ready to continue with success. Even knowing that the work would be very hard for the colonists. I had forgotten how petty things were in Mombasa. What a big mistake of mine. - I think we'll have to go there. - I think so too, why not? Good choice, isn't it? - Hunters. - Hunters? Are you sure? Without a doubt, bwana. There, bwana. Put it all in the truck. Hello Bethlehem, Ambrose. What are you doing here? - What was that about? - A lance. Put him on the couch. How did this happen? Ivory hunters. - Not in those parts. - Yes, I saw them. We confiscated the ivory. Confiscated. What are you going to do with that? What can I do? Only the government has that power. But he cannot expose Ambrose and Bethlehem to the government. Mary, I can't ignore that. I will not be able to take care of everything in Africa. No, I suppose not... but. But it seems. Can't you understand? The settlers were not here before. Nor Ambrose and Bethlehem. I will have to do one thing at the expense of another. That's better. You had luck. - I will go to Mombasa with you. - Do what? I have things to buy there. And then, I need to talk to Ushingo. - How are you, bwana? - How are you, Ushingo? I'm ashamed of that, bwana. It is not good for our friendship. It's not your fault. I'm sorry, but I have to take this to the government. But... will they be arrested? Yes. I'm afraid they will. Ushingo, why were settlers smuggling ivory? What is happening? Where are the young people? Why is everything in the colony changing? I don't like that either. You are a friend. I know there are ivory hunters here. Reason for the problems among my people. Something that spreads. - Even among my own children. - But you're the boss. It can prevent. They do not listen to me, neither to strangers or to the laws of the tribe. What strangers? They come from the coast, bwana. Buying my people for ivory. - And lead us to error. - Listen. You don't have to protect them. My people need protection too. Either way, the whole of Africa is to blame. If Africa steals, we are the thieves. If Africa kills, we are the killers. If they fall into temptations. We will still be wild. This treasure is the temptation for freedom. This does not respond to these actions. What can we do now? Destroy those temptations, bwana. Before they destroy my people. Money is the temptation to enter cities. My people have too simple a life to enter the city. There is no place for them there. As soon as the money runs out. Get rid of us. Hunger plagues us. Becoming thieves in the hands of bandits. Wives and children are abandoned. They need your help. They need more help. More than animals. I'm sorry, Ushingo. That is my duty and work. Everything I said is true, bwana. I know what you said is true. But I have no choice. Come on in. Look, Dad. the gelanas. Bob, look. Are fighting. A women's fight. Do me a favor. Take them to Chief Ushingo. - What smile is that? - I'm happy, Bob. You too and know it. I'm afraid I'm not a God. But it is a duty to do. This kind gesture will not solve much. I think I'll see my boss. Come on, honey, I'll take you to the hotel. A reasonable doubt. But that does not define Africa. Maybe you're the only one who wants to try and face it. Citizens also want to face this as well. Do not forget that I did everything to put you where you are. Even though it cost me a lot of money. That material alone cost me fifteen thousand. I had to pay myself with funds from my private business. We are talking about weapons that will allow me to inspect the island all along the coast. Not leaving my helpers with only bows and spears. I told you, Bob. The police are everywhere. This is unnecessary. Many jellies are left with nothing to do and wandering around. But gelanas have always lived that way. If you want to stop. Why not try a big play behind the scenes. This is not that simple, Bob. - Do you understand what I would have to... - The gelanas do. Stop that speech. If you want to contact the agency to stop these smugglers... ... there has to be only one plausible reason for your sentence. To mess with them and release me for something. Speaking extra officially. Why don't you take the reins yourself? - Aren't you serious? - Believe. This is serious work. It was not my intention to override the authorities. - Smuggling with the agency. - Good thought, but I know you. This is your chance to give gelanas a chance. - But look at the size... - It's small compared to all of Africa. - Easy to catch contraband. - In Zanzibar? It will be your first detention point. Zanzibar. This is where it will start. During the next two weeks I started to explore Zanzibar. It was like a puzzle. Any of those river arms could hide smugglers. I was like a tourist who wanted to fish. And I didn't know anything. And one last desperate attempt. I decided to visit each Arab bazaar in Zanzibar. Hoping to get some clue. This sound around here is fun. To walk in Zanzibar you have to get used to it. It may look terrible but it doesn't bother me. Where's Tim? This is the Zanzibar Hotel. Close to the market. - This is the market. - A very good market. - In a very good tone. - This is the Indian bazaar. Indian bazaar. Zanzibar Hotel... Come on, Tim. Hurry up. Wait a minute, Mary. Want this piece made with ivory? It is very beautiful. - Looks like other material to me. - No. It's just ivory. Just him. - How about this here? - No thank you. Imitation. I've seen that citizen before. It's him. M'Kwongi. Do you remember that guy who ran away? Don't lose sight of it. Mary, come. K HINGONI and SONS ivory trade SUPPLIERS FOR ROYALTY. - In there, bwana. - Quick before you go to the coast. We picked it up at an ivory store. Very astute. Acting in a standard store. To dispel suspicion. - It wouldn't seem possible. - I wouldn't believe it if I wasn't seeing it. Mom? I can stay here? I find stores very boring. Of course, I don't blame you. But don't go anywhere. Welcome to my establishment. I'm at your service. How about a very charming ornament? Or something more eye-catching? - Please sit down. - Thanks. - Jambo. - How are you, boy? Hello, what are you eating? Choki choki, do you want one? Looks good. So itâ€™s not good. That's good. - What is it? - Dangut. This is a material with centuries of existence, madame. Passed from father to son. See this exclusive prey, madame. Sir? My son will be happy to assist you. I think your husband needs attention too. I liked that species. Are you from Kenya? No, sir. It's from Tabora, Tanganyika. Now if you want... I became interested in this part of the store. I like this one. - I want to look. - Sir, would you mind if... That's what I want to talk to you about. There is much and I would like to examine it well. There is something on that side that we could discuss. Sorry, it is private and no strangers are allowed to enter. I see. - How much do you want for her? - How much do you give me? - This is the great Arab captain. - Really captain? - Yes. Now, sir. I have something special for you. For special customers like you. What a magnificent outfit that man was wearing. Yes, and that dagger? I want to buy it. I have more things to show here at the store, mr. Yes, sir. - M'Kwongi? Did you pass by? - No, bwana. Daddy, did you see a captain dressed in white? Juma, said you are a real captain. - Who is Juma? - Jambo. - Jambo, for you. He said he saw the captain. Where did it come from? I know who is. The great captain. Captain Dhow. If mr. wants to see Dhow Haba. Girl and captain in abundance. - The Great Captain. - Do you know where I can find him? - Sure. - Pay later. Let's go. - It's the same captain, Dad. - Don't talk so loud. - Bob, don't miss it. - Losing him? It would follow him all over the city. So this is the type of customer? He is handsome. - What will happen now? - Dhow will be out tonight. - As you know? - Too much time watching. You sure know how to bargain, don't you? I wonder where they come from. From Kenya, Tanganyika, to bring ivory. - Ivory? Is that what you think? - Yes, that's what I think. Here is our answer. With that we could follow them. - What's the name of that, M'Kwongi? - Aningilaw, bwana. I'll get you one. If you want an Aningilaw. I get a big one. You little smart guy. They are picking up speed. - Redirect the candles. - Yes, bwana. Tell to keep in front of starboard. You are reluctant, bwana. Said it's too small for that. We have to stay behind them. Tell him to go ahead. I feel like Robinson CrusoÃ©. What do you say, buddy? - I'm Monday, Bwana. - What I know is Friday. - How it feels? - All broken, bwana. You'll recover from that. By the way, how do men feel about being guards? Said you are a great man, bwana. That will pay double. You what? How much are you talking about? - Only 1,000 shillings. - A thousand shillings? Realize that it won't be too much if they get fired. Let's go I believe we will have to go through that stream. Maybe we can have a chance over there. Maybe we can face Dhow again. What would we do? Chat? Ask if it would make us go across the stream. Convention. Make him an offer. - He will, bwana. - Tell him I'll pay you. But next time I will negotiate. Are you sure they come back across the stream? Yes, bwana. There is no other way with the tide. - With the tide? - Yes, bwana. Good. We hope. What are you doing there? They don't seem to be fishing. They do not fish for fishing, bwana. They fish by touch. - They're not using a line. - They fish differently, bwana. - As well? - Fishing through the pull. They tie a line to a fish and throw it in the water. Crappie is like a bait that holds, so nothing. When he attaches himself to prey. They feel by touch then... You will see how they do it, bwana. I wouldn't want to be around there, bwana. I wouldn't want to have a fish like that touching me. It's the dhow. Was right. M'kwongi, pull the anchor. Start it. Before he leaves. M'Kwongi, I will release the candle. Come on, come on, Skeeper. Come on, go ahead. Come on, come on, Skeeper. Let's go. See, Dad. Skeeper set a new record. - Okay, but don't make so much noise. - Bob? Just because you couldn't catch dhow, you don't have to be rude. Come on, at the meal. This one for the captain kid. This one for Long John Suliver. I hope I understand. - Did you forget that Captain Kid left? - It can stay for you. It makes him behave like an idiot. Maybe yes. But I do feel good in your own home. Even with you trying to kill yourself twice. Sometimes my business gets out of control and... And maybe next time I won't be so lucky. It could be a helper of yours, Tim or... me. Bob, how about working in the office? I know it may not be the way you want to help the gelanas, but... Being a detective makes it look like your place... Of course, now I begin to understand. It makes you look like a desperate man, a gangster. - There's no reason to think... - That's not your duty, dear. Sorry, Bob. But this is work for the police. - Mary, wait a minute... - Bob. This was not what we wanted. - No, I wouldn't take this service... - And wouldn't it be good enough? How do you know it wouldn't be? Besides, nobody would want to... Yes, the police. - The police are busy with the whole of Kenya... - So this is for you, now? I'm getting sick. I'm going for a walk. Mary. - Don't you support me in that? - Of course yes. But you don't understand that I'm afraid. I wish you would always come home. I suppose you're right. I'm playing detective. It's all right. I will leave this before it becomes a problem for us. I'm sure it's the only thing you have to do. But, there's just one more thing. - What? - I left M'Kwongi in Mombasa. - Taking care of everything. "You don't think he would find out, do you?" - Please, I'm innocent. - What's the sentence? For this man to be released, a thousand shillings must be paid. A thousand shillings? This is too much. - The government will pay. - Bwana, please. M'Kwongi, this will be the last time. Tell the judge that I will pay. You will return to the embassy to renew your visa for a few more months. But, bwana, that would imply that I have to go to the police. And in prison I would never meet Mr. - Mister? - One with a big nose, bwana. You will get at least five years. He knows everything that happens in Mombasa. He knows everything about hunters and ivory. - Are you telling the truth? - He can say many things. - It will say that they are acting here now. - Where exactly? I will show you, come bwana. Better be right. There, bwana. That guide you're commanding. Guide? It looks like a slave alienator. Indeed, bwana. Go to India. And they like it. Get ivory. Big like that. He told me himself. - And how do you know that? - I saw your shipment. Do you expect me to believe it is the clue to get everything? Yes, bwana. He likes me, he's my wife's religion. - It's all right. I think customers will buy from him. - Is that you? Wait a minute. You have two wives. It's double work, bwana. You are a smart guy. Now that. We cannot make a contingent available because of a suspicion. Will you want that? Pay to see. He's convinced. It could be one thing. The problem is that this will require a lot. We have to resort to special authorities to gain access. Suppose I can get a team? And be lucky like never before. It will require a lot of equipment, planning and all the work. But I can take care of that for you. M'Kwongi, you are confident in your track, aren't you? - Of course, sir. I know him. - Right. - We can get to the Dhow. - I suppose so, bwana. What's it? Is there anything wrong with this story? No. Everything you said is true, bwana. It is good that we resolve this. By the way, what is your man's area of â€‹â€‹expertise? - Algeria. - Algeria? Go away. - Here it is, bwana. - Good job, we got it. Do you work in the port and live in Mandingo? That's right, sir. And you work for the company Mombasa Ramadee? And you are telling me that you were the only one to conduct this work? My client did not commit crime, your honor. Only responsible for transport. And not for the ivory that the transport contained. - Only works in transportation. - And I represent you for the company. You are telling me that only the company is responsible for the shipment. Responsible for the shipment and the ivory it contained? I am afraid there is a misunderstanding in your interrogation. Respect your innocence. I repeat, my client is not responsible. Here is a series of documents that prove what you were carrying. Offering my client protection from anything the company did. Would you like to examine them? We've seen it before, and again and again. I suppose your client will say that it has nothing to do with ivory? Nothing at all, captain. It's like it says there. The ivory trade charge is irresponsible to my client. Therefore, all charges must be eliminated. - We all know that your client is a liar. - Mr. Ward? In favor of my client, I must protest strongly. It would not be prudent to use this language. We know the procedures, we received your protest. If he was just in charge of the ship. You will keep the costs for the board meeting for judging the case. Three thousand and sixty-five pieces of tasks. Converts become twenty-one pounds. - You can accompany him. - Yes, thank you, sir. Thank you sir. captain. Thank you. Thanks. I can be excused now, sir. Commissioner? I suppose so. - The same story. - Everyone protects you from saying something. Hadn't you said he was going to be arrested? There were? I would like to do that. That would dispense a thousand shillings a month. But outside it is easier. It is difficult to fight against it. That's life. I don't believe you will leave it at that. Will you get away with it? That's how it works, mrs. Payton. It involves the interest of great people. Ivory. - What about the others? - No evidence. As long as they pay lawyers, they are legally above the evidence. These files show what they do with the operations. We've already taken the scheme, men, but these lawyers are above the basics. This breaks our reasoning. And it wastes our time. I'm sorry, Ushingo. I would like to make you pay legally. I don't know how to say how disappointing that is. The justice of white men does strange things, bwana. It looks like it's run by mean men. Sometimes the cool things are... For her, it is right to punish my men for the ivory, isn't it? - Will you want to do cool things with them too? - But... This is very relative to Ushingo. - Sooner or later these thugs... - Maybe it's too late. Come on, Bob. What do you think of a drink? - Happy with the decision? - Certainly. Do you want to give professional advice? Do you have any advice that best convinces me? In this case it may be better to do it privately. Here in my office. Would you like to come in? Mr. and Mrs. Payton, please, please sit down. Mr. Payton, in my profession, advice is usually paid for. It doesn't mean anything to me. I actually want to congratulate you. It puts your experience above the basics. - Putting it cheap... - Cheap, no sir. Payton. They are very expensive and cost a lot of money. Don't you understand what you're doing to innocent tribes in Africa? Maybe I'm doing it, maybe not. But... Mrs. Payton, don't think that I'm being cruel. Putting this delicate situation at the expense of innocent tribes? Come on, mrs. Payton. Let's be realistic. The world cannot wait for its civilization... ... be dominated by these black tribes. This ivory business is destroying an entire people, the gelanas. - In the hands of these wild smugglers. - But, Miss. Payton? In Africa, this is the destiny that blacks carry. And they are wild, even if that is unfortunate, but it is inevitable. Perhaps it is convenient to forget about the industrial revolution made by its people. Africa mr. Payton, is having its industrial revolution. And nothing sentimental will stop you. You, speaking like an African? I'm not African. A Phoenician, perhaps, full of passion. But, not African. I am practically an African Phoenician. It is easy for a conqueror to be magnanimous. You are not African mr. Payton. What's your biggest offer right now? Why am I talking to you man to man. I would like to know what your interests are. Or something similar. I always go slow, sir. Payton. Even on that kind of subject. But, here is my home. And I command. No spaces for blacks. And ask me to sympathize with you with them? I am against certain changes, sir. Payton. And the disappearance of the gelanas would be very bad. It's a direct expression, isn't it? But, forgive me. I'm being a missionary. I don't want to occupy them anymore. - I would like to... - In this cynical world... ... indeed charming and also realistic. Have better luck. Mr. Payton, you cannot take all the pains of Africa. Sure. This is what I can call a plan. - Just saw the way of thinking. - He's the meanest man I've ever met. Bob, you have to go on to a higher level. - They use the law by their side... - I don't give a shit. I will not change my thinking, obviously not. I think so too, but there's nothing I can do. There must be something we can do. What a horrible man. Tim, Mary. Quick, it's time to go. I'm on my way. I won't be long, sir. Skeeper. See you soon. Do you remember that there was not much to start, M'Kwongi? I know how to feed them. With food. I was thinking of seeing Ushingo this morning. Take a walk with him. He's really down, isn't he? That lawyer talk doesn't get out of my head. Yes, that bothers. Acts with the gelanas as if they were separate. I am helpless. Looking for answers. I feel the way you're talking. Bob, look. It started at six in the morning. And it's still working. Better go. I'll see you later. Keep everything clean. Or I'll remember something else to do. That's right. Goodbye, Dad. Until night. Good luck, champion. Ushingo, how long has everything been abandoned here like this? You have responsibilities to fulfill. You owe it to us. - I'm ashamed, bwana. - You can solve this. My people have a taste of evil. If I try to correct them, they challenge me. I'm sorry, bwana. - It's too late. - It is not. You have to help yourself. Do you think it's easy for black men to help themselves? They don't care if they live or not. Whether they think or not. I'm not speaking like a government man, Ushingo. But as a friend of yours that I have always been. What do you want here, government man? We don't want you here. Go home. Forgive me, bwana. This got out of hand. Breaks the tribe's hospitality laws. Whoever insults them is too much for them. Bwana, what should I do. Tell me and I will. When are you going to smuggle ivory again? Tonight. I will tell you the truth. I want the hunters too. I want to see who it's delivered to, and where it's taking it. Ushingo, the weapon. Rest, bwana. We can't do anything tonight. What do you mean, rest? I didn't get shot. It's very dangerous. Rest, bwana. Bwana. Delana spear, bwana. They are foolish young men. But I have not been a good father to them. I will not rest while they are on this bloody path. This way. Are you sure you're telling me the truth? Everything I want to know, affects here. Why don't you want to talk to me? What scares them to say something to me? Ambrose, where is your father? - You went for a walk, mrs. - Bethlehem, where's the boss? They lie, mrs. They fear something. Fuck you all. What's the matter with him? Something is hurting, isn't it? What? Fifteen bananas? He'll be fine now. She says she would like to tell you something about bwana Payton. But first you will have to promise not to punish young men. Of course. She said that some men came last night to pick up ivory. Bwana and the chief followed them. These men were angry. And they would kill anyone. My husband and your father are in danger. And they knew it. Give me a ride. Maybe someone here can help you. They could at least go to the police. It's to keep the police out of this. You promised. You know who you're going after, don't you? I want you to show me at once. If they don't say. I will kill them. With your own hands. Did you hear me? - I will do this. - It's all right. We will show you. Many people came by, bwana. I think we lost the trail. Yes, I'm afraid so. The only thing to do is to follow those tracks. What is happening? The great fishing festival, bwana. The bosses here are friends of mine, bwana. They said that no different man was seen here. Just beyond the river. - We can use your canoe. - Great. Stop. It's your jacket. - Think that...? - Bwana is a difficult man to kill. Ambrose, what's wrong? What's it? - Ushingo and bwana went this way. - Are you sure? I think bwana followed the hunters' trail. We better go. - They see us. We have to be careful. - Indeed, bwana. Be careful, we better go more to the middle. - Going down here ends up in the river, mrs. - It's all right. - The truck can't go that way. - I'm hopeless. Let's be honest. We better get back. - We're sorry, mrs. - It is very bad when the loved one is lost. You have to help the gelanas, now. Why I won't help anymore. Listen, Ushingo. Let's go. Go up, M'Kwongi. Stop. Stop, stop, mrs. Look. Bob. Bob. It was good to come here. I was in need of medical care. - The radio wouldn't take over here. - It is the profession of the profession. You may have to go ten miles further. Bob, you're crazy. You saw what these men are capable of. They're murderers and you don't want to walk... - Mary, this is official... - This is no joke. These are murderers, now. If you're not sure, I am. You are exaggerating. Bwana did everything a friend could do. - I must support you. - Don't be ridiculous too, Ushingo. This is a job for the Mombasa police. It would be a job for the police if the lawyers allowed it. I saw how my young men's bodies look, Mrs. My children and I must go. I suppose you think everything he said is true. You men. You asshole. I don't want to see you coming towards me anymore. Put the ivory on board. Fast. They are shipping everything. We need to be faster. We will lose them. If they see us they will be able to return. Ushingo. Bob. Bob. Ushingo, come back. Come back. Ushingo, don't be silly. Murderers. Murderers. Get away from my men. Get away from my men. Murderers. Murderers. Get away... No, Bob. Do not go. I'm done here, mrs. My fight is gone. We lost them. Damn you. I'm sorry, Ushingo. It is not too late, bwana. Look. The river turns like this. Here the location is not good. And in this convergence there are many reefs. We can expect them at night. - You say we caught them going straight over there? - Yes, bwana. There are horrible rocks there. Difficult to get through. Nobody can cross. I'm not so sure about that. - Honey. - Bob. You can't get away from your business, can you? Please take care. I couldn't bear to lose him. - They feel indebted to you, bwana. - Say that again. Let's go. They really weren't that fast. They have not yet crossed that strip of water. Say that they killed your father, Ushingo. Say we need men and canoes and fast. Stay away from me. Mr Payton, where are you? - Are you responsible for this disorder? - Why would I be? I don't remember anything you said about them. I told you. Everything you were. That's right. But that's been a while. Take him. We will always be grateful to you, bwana. Take care of everyone. And unite them again. Do you see everyone, bwana? They want to have a party. But I think we have a long way to go before moving on. And I want to see that. This is a big, young country. But I think it's enough for us to be able to grow. - I want to live in peace. - I share that too. - Greetings, bwana. Greetings, mrs. - Greetings. - Greetings. Good luck with everyone. Do you think they'll be okay, Bob? I hope so. I think so. With the best leaders. - Taking two things into consideration. - What? Passion... ... and tolerance.
