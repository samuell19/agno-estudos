Interstate 12. By a place called Rio Puerco. - [Ron] I know right were you are. Wait there, we'll be by to pick you up in half an hour sharp, okay with you? - I'll be ready. - [Ron] John! - Yeah? - [Ron] You rode partway here in a boxcar, am I right? How bad do you look? - How bad do you want me to look? - [Ron] Get yourself cleaned up. You're about to meet a millionaire. - Can I help you? Can I help you? Don't mess up the stock, all right? (eerie music) People always coming in here, rifling through the stock, never intending to buy. You do have money? - How much? (cash register beeping) - Out of 50. I didn't mean to say that you weren't going to pay. I got 10, 12 people through here everyday trying to shoplift what they want. You wouldn't believe what the country's coming to. Thank you, come again. - Look, do you got a place I could wash up? - I'm sorry, the restroom's out of order. - I just need a shave. - Well, I do have a washroom in the building next door. I guess you can use that. - Thanks. - It's pretty dirty in there. I haven't been in there for years. But I think the water still works. - That's all I need. - That's all you're gonna get. (ominous music) (traffic whooshing) (entry bell ringing) Come and get me when you're done so I can lock up. Don't be too long. (ominous beat music) (water faucet trickling) Well, hello, can I help you? - [Reagan] Move it, asshole! - [Nixon] Where's the money? I said, where's the fucking money, now! - I don't keep much money in the store, it's too early. - [Nixon] Listen, dick weed, the money now! - Please, take anything you want. - [Nixon] 32 fucking dollars is all you have? - Please don't hurt me, just take the money. - [Reagan] What do you got next door? - It's just a storage room. That's all, I don't use it anymore. (clerk whimpering) - [Nixon] This is a piece of shit job! - [Reagan] All this shit! The money comes fucking to us! (ominous music) - [Nixon] This is a bullshit scene! At least I'm gonna get something out of this, huh? (Reagan laughing) - Woo! (gunshot booming) (glass shattering) (gunshots banging) Think I won't shoot you, huh? (clerk whimpering) - [Nixon] Hey, maybe some of the money's over there, huh? - Tell me where the money is, now! (clerk whimpering) (gunshot booming) I think the money's over there, huh? - [Nixon] Let's go look. - [Reagan] All right! Let's keep this party going! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Only, you'll need a mask! (woman whimpering) (clerk yelling) Come on, let's go! - [Nixon] Come on, move it! Let's go! - Get going! - Open that door! - Come on! (lively tempo music) - [Reagan] Move it! Move it, come on! Let's go! Let's get in there! - [Nixon] Get the fuck inside, come on! Open up, come on! - Get in there! - [Nixon] This is a fucking joke, man! (foreboding music) - [Reagan] Come on, tell me where the money is! (woman screaming) I know you've got money in here. Now you tell me where it is. - There isn't any money. - Where's the money? - There isn't any money. - Where's the money? - There isn't, please! There isn't any money! - Get off me! - There isn't any money. (lively tempo music) (woman screaming) - [Woman] Get off of me. (punch thudding) - God! Shit! (kick thudding) - [Reagan] The cash is here, old man. Where is it? - There isn't any money. - Tell me where it is! - Please, there isn't any money. - I know it's here! (glass shattering) Who is that? (lively tempo music) I'm gonna waste you, fucker! (gunshots booming) Come on out here so I can see you! (gunshot booming) You're dead! I'm gonna waste you right where you stand! (police siren alarming) (gunshot booming) (suspenseful music) You wanna be a hero? Get out here! Get out here, now! (punch thudding) (police siren alarming) (ominous music) (clerk whimpering) - Take it easy, we're gonna get you some help. - [Officer] Freeze! (ominous music) - He's not one of them. - Put the gun down on the floor, now. - You okay, miss? - Yes, he saved our lives. - [John] Look, I have a friend waiting for me and I'm late. - What friend? - I'll just finish shaving and I'll be on my way. - Stay right where you are. How about we see some I.D.? - I don't carry I.D. Only cash, if I have any. - Very funny. You do have a name. - John Slade. (officer chuckling) - That sounds like a boy's name but you look like a girl. You know what I think? I think he's some faggot rockstar who blew all his money on drugs. Or prove to me I'm wrong. - I'm here for a job. - A job. What job? - I got an interview at Markson Industries tomorrow, 9AM. - Markson Industries, what're they, opening a beauty parlor? (officer chuckling) - What's this job you've been offered? - That's classified. - [Officer] Classified? - A classified rockstar working for Markson Industries. I find that hard to believe. - You know what I think? I think Tarzan, here, set this whole thing up. (suspenseful music) (officers groaning) - A girl, huh? A very dangerous girl. (punch thudding) (traffic whooshing) (gentle music) - Hey, Johnny. How're you doing, man? - Good to see you again. - Yeah. Oh. What do you think of this car? Pretty snazzy, huh? One of Markson's toys. Oh, this is Jackie, Markson's daughter. Gotta watch out for this kid. It's been years since he's seen a sharp-looking girl who didn't smell bad. - Boy, you haven't changed a bit. (EMT siren alarming) (dramatic beat music) - Hi, Jerry, it's me, Ron. Go ahead. Hey, listen, that offer for dinner with me and the family still holds. Go on. (pleasant flute music) Hey, what is it, are we late or something? What? - Look at that. Dozens of people homeless and the Unites States government has spent 305 billion dollars this year on weapons. - Oh, so what're you gonna do about it, Daddy? - Lay off it, Jackie. You know, we still got the Russians to worry about. - Oh yeah, it's always the Russians. - Look, they'd spend as much money on it as we do if they had it to spend. - We force them to spend it just to keep up with us. - Jackie, excuse my French, but war is one universal shit storm. (somber music) - John, I'm glad you came. I hope you understand we don't always behave like this. But today's a special day. I'm having a new weapon demonstrated to all concerned. (somber music) - John Slade. Well I'll be damned. (ominous music) - And now for the big surprise. - What sort of monstrosity have you dreamed up this time, Daddy? - Jackie, give it a rest. - I wanna show you a truly unique robotic device. I call it a "Smart Egg." My "Smart Egg" is an anti-personal weapon with an artificial intelligence. A brain that can be programmed by using any one of a number of readily available desktop personal computers. Its guidance system contains an intelligence chip capable of highly responsive reactions. A system capable of thinking for itself. - Listen, you sure you wanna show off your new toy right here in the open for all these people? - Yeah. I want them to see the demonstration. - [Ron] Yeah? - Let's do it, shall we? (electronic humming) (laser buzzing) (explosion rumbling) (explosion rumbling) (laser buzzing) (explosion rumbling) (electronic humming) (laser buzzing) (explosion rumbling) (electronic humming) (explosions booming) (ominous music) - Oh, Markson, you son of a bitch. (fire crackling) - I don't intend for us to invent or develop weapons one day longer but I do intend for us to make this company useful. See those people living over by the fence? I want you to help them build shelters on this parking lot. We'll begin in our own backyard and then I'm gonna reorganize this company so that we can begin to address what's become in this country an embarrassing, outrageous, chronic housing shortage. As of this moment, right now, we're out of the weapons business. (fire crackling) (traffic whooshing) - Ron, dinner at eight. - Are you bringing Bob? - We're celebrating Daddy's new life, and yes, I'm bringing Bob. - Who's Bob? - A bum, a rich bum. I don't like him. He's all mouth. - Hey, Ron. - [Ron] What? - Why'd you ask me to come here? - You think Markson is just gonna be able to walk away from a multi-million dollar weapons industry? He's gonna get bothered by every money hungry son-of-a-bitch that knows his name. Come on, let me show you the restaurant. (man speaking foreign language) So, a lot of people are gonna want Markson to go on doing his thing, making machines to kill people. You can help them to understand that he's very serious about this career change. How much money you got? - 10 bucks and change. - Uh-huh, looks like they got to you just in time. Markson's coming over tonight for a poker game. I get up a game every couple of weeks. Markson's not much of a poker player but he always has a good time. Watch your head, here. This place is built for midgets. It's almost 150 years old. I got it at first sight. I've known Markson for 47 years. He's my best friend until you came along. He's gotten me out of a lot of scrapes here. You know, something about this place makes you wanna (pleasant music) grow old, smiling. Sometimes I think there must be an Indian burial ground here, and way down there, someplace, there's a mummified warrior sending his good vibes up to me. - Boy, you have changed. - Yeah. Well, remember how I used to put down the whiskey? No more. I'm a restaurant owner now. And if you care about food, and I've gotta care about food, whiskey dulls your palette. You can't taste anything. So I have a little wine now and then. I'll take a glass of Evian water with a squeeze of lime in it. (John laughing) Yeah, John, I've completely gone to seed. - No shit. (Ron chuckling) - Well, I gotta start cooking for the evening crowd. (gentle guitar music) You can stay here as long as you want. I got some new clothes for you, you might wanna change. I'll see you in the cafe. - Hey, Ron. - Huh? - Thanks. (lively tempo music) (metal clanking) (distant gunshots banging) - Shark! (gunshots booming) (glass shattering) What the hell's going on here? Stop fucking around! Where's Willis? - He's upstairs with Vanna. - You look beautiful. Relax. Relax. (Willis moaning) - Willis. (ominous music) - Elias, you putz. Don't you ever knock? (Elias knocking) - Markson blew up the damn thing. It was like he knew I was there watching. - Clever man, Dr. Markson. - Fred, does this mean that we're not gonna get our fucking money? - Vanna, please, the money is not the problem. - Damn it, did you hear what I just said? There's no more prototype. - Elias, I do the thinking. We don't need the prototype, we do need Markson and his daughter. (ominous music) Markson's trying to wish me away from his invention and that little show he put on for you was just that, a little show. Our good friend, Deputy Hanks, had a very pleasant introduction to an old friend of yours this morning. - John Slade. - Deputy Hanks and his partner tried to arrest Slade and he ties them to a post outside a truck stop. That's very messy, Mr. Elias! I mean, if I didn't know better, I'd feel a little paranoid. Now Ron Morrell is a good army buddy of yours, an old friends of yours, and he calls in another army buddy for help? Somebody that you've trained? Now you're gonna have to kill Deputy Hanks and I want you to do it as soon as you can because I need a trail of crooked cops to get out of this mess. Damn it, I hired you to kidnap Markson and his daughter. - It'll be a clean raid tonight. - Oh yeah, that means getting Markson and his daughter out alive, asshole. - That's right, you better keep that temper of yours in check. I've been working on this deal for almost a year and I want to pull it off and disappear rich. And I don't wanna have to explain your failures to my superiors at the FBI! You know, they're not gonna show you any sympathy. You can kill Slade, can't you? - I'll kill Slade! - And if he can't do it, I'll kill Slade. (punch thudding) (Shark yelping) - Elias, will you stop? (suspenseful music) - Hey, what's your problem? - Get ready to fly. (Shark groaning) I don't want him along tonight. - [Shark] Oh man. (Shark groaning) I don't need this shit from him. (pleasant mariachi band music) (Ron speaking foreign language) - Hey, why don't you get yourself a drink? I mean, if you want to. I don't wanna force you to get a drink but relax, Johnny, relax. (Ron speaking foreign language) Come on! (pleasant mariachi band music) Best I guess, you brought reinforcements. - Which one's Bob? - The loud horse's ass with the designer glasses. (John chuckling) (people chattering) - [Jackie] Hey, play us a song. (people clapping) ♪ Troublemaker ♪ ♪ I've got my eyes on you ♪ (lively piano music) ♪ Don't be mistaken ♪ ♪ I'm watching everything that you do ♪ ♪ And I can't let you get through ♪ ♪ To me ♪ ♪ Troublemaker ♪ (people clapping) Are you having fun, hun? - Uh-huh. - [Bob] We're having a great time. - Nobody asked you. ♪ But if you told me you loved me everyday ♪ We okay here? ♪ And in your arms, I always stay ♪ Great pieces of art, aren't they? Jackie, come on over here, you haven't had the chance to talk to my friend, John. - Hi. You left this in the car this morning. - Thanks. - John is one of the best infiltration men I've ever known. First in the Marines, then in the Army. - Oh, so you're a soldier. - Not at the moment. - I was never a very good soldier, I talked too much. Got me into a lot of trouble. Viet Cong were gonna cut my tongue out but then they decided to just split it in half. Then I talked twice as much, so there was an army surgeon, he took it and sewed it back together, you know. Now I talk like this all the time. (John and Jackie laughing) - Ron, old buddy, how's it going? - Since when are you my buddy? (Bob chuckling) - Jackie says you're a pretty good game of poker. - Yeah, well, if you got enough money it might be a pretty good game. - What're you looking at? - Bob, be civil. John, this is Bob Evens. - Jackie, why do we have to hang around with some muscle-headed gorilla for? - Bobby, you keep a civil tongue when you're in my cafe or somebody's gonna tear your limb from limb and stuff the pieces down your throat. And it might not be me. (Bob chuckling) - Jackie, come on, when you get a chance, okay? - Okay. - Thanks. - Always a pleasure, Bob. Sorry about that. - Ron, I'm starved, what's for dinner? - Ah, we got something really special for you tonight to celebrate your father's new career. - Well, Daddy's late again, so let's eat. - Okay, check the kitchen out. - Okay. - Please, don't get up. - I have to. See you later. (faint mariachi band music) - All right, listen up. Markson got himself some help. - [Max] What help? - John Slade. - Hey, Slade is mean. He went through me and me partner this morning like we weren't even there. - Now listen! None of us get paid unless we deliver Markson and his daughter alive. So let's just do it. And don't get sloppy. Max and I will take Hanks with us. Carlos, you stay close. Max and I will grab Markson, Paulie, Bob, you get his daughter. (gun cranking) - Neat gun. Thanks. - Why'd you give her a gun? - I didn't give her the goddamn gun! - You say something? - Just stay the fuck in the van. - Elias, fuck you! I don't have to take orders from you. You're not my boss, you know. (gun clicking) - [Max] Amigo, what about our friend, Deputy Hanks? - Hanks. Take him for a walk. (faint upbeat mariachi band music) - [Markson] Thank you, Larry. If Ron has any food left, I'll have him send some out. - Hey, you wanna get in on this game? Got lots of money. Lots of money. - Oh, here he comes. - [Jackie] Daddy, you're so late. - I'm sorry, honey, don't get up. Gentlemen. - [Jackie] Is there anything wrong? - Nothing that a good poker game won't cure. - You missed my food. And it won't warm up either. - That's my loss, Ron. (sinister music) (guns cranking) (pleasant piano music) Robert, what do you say? - 300 more. - I fold. - That's my girl. - [John] There's three... And three more. - Identify this guy, Slade, for you. - [Max] Oh yeah. - Yeah, get a little action, your deal goes through. I make some money, hey, it's pretty cool. (Hank gagging) (Ron laughing) - Ron's in, Mark, 600. - I'm in. - I'm out. - 600. 600, is it? All right, I'm in. (neck cracking) 300 to you, Bob. - I'll call 300. - [Markson] Let's see what you got. (Bob chuckling) - Aces up eights. Full house, read 'em and weep. - Sorry. Four Jacks. - Shit. - Nice hand. - You lucky son of a bitch. - I want a timeout. - Damn. (pleasant guitar music) - Okay, I'll hold your stakes for you. Winners always get the girls, don't they? (crickets chirping) (faint pleasant guitar music) Hey, Jackie. Excuse me, John. Look, your boyfriend's here and they're eating the furniture. Can you go back in an quiet them down or do I have to bounce them? - I'll be there in a minute. - Now! - I'll be in in a minute. - Okay, I'll bounce them. - You're not in any shape to drive, Mark. That's what I've been trying to talk about. - Everybody stay very still. (gunshots booming) - Put your hands on the table now! (ominous music) - What is it that you want? - Dr. Markson, get up and come over to me. (intense music) Quickly! (gunshots booming) - Please don't kill me. We'll get you anything you want. - Please don't kill me. - Anything you want! - Don't! (gunshots booming) (upbeat guitar music) (gunshots booming) - Goddamn it, they got Markson! - Stay down! (gunshot booming) - [Ron] I'll cover you! (gunshots booming) (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) (John groaning) (kick thudding) (punches thudding) (gunshot booming) (man screaming) (fire rumbling) (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) (gunshots popping) (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) - They got Paulie and Bob. - Slade. Come on, let's go. (engine revving) (gunshots booming) (Ron sighing) - Who the hell where those guys? - Elias lead the raid. - Elias? He's dead. - Apparently not. - [Jackie] Ron! - In a minute. Elias. Shit. (police sirens alarming) (police sirens alarming) (faint police radio chattering) (crickets chirping) - Over here? - Yes, sir. There's one body in the car. And there's a man dead over here, sir. He's one of ours, Deputy Glen Hanks. (ominous music) - [Officer] How do I know you didn't kill Deputy Hanks? - Because I told you I didn't. - Listen, buddy, you're not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. - Did it ever occur to you that Hanks knew who killed him? - Hell yes. He knew you. - The people that killed Markson's driver killed Hanks. - Listen, hotshot, you've got four thousand dollars cash in your pocket. Blood money, right? I saw you this morning, you were shaving in some truck stop bathroom, broke. You're in this. You're gonna tell me how. - Look, I don't know why they kidnapped my father. He was working on some new project. He never really talked about it or anything but he was a little worried. What're you gonna do about it? You know, you're just standing around here asking me these stupid questions when you could be out there doing something. (foreboding music) - Deputy. I'll take it from here. - And who are you? - FBI. Special Agent Willis. Who were they? - I have no idea. - Markson didn't tell you why he asked you to come here? - I met Markson today for the first time. - Mr. Slade, you have a very impressive military record for somebody your age. Army Special Forces, Delta Forces in the Middle East, underwater demolition training in Iraq, expelled from El Salvador for counter-revolutionary activities. You've kept very busy. Mr. Slade, Dr. Markson has invented something very deadly and even though he's destroyed the prototype, the plan is still in his head. He's a valuable military property and it would be dangerous to have him up for sale to an unfriendly power. If you can help us bring Markson back, do you understand? Am I making myself clear? - Word for word. - You can't charge them with a crime. They're victims. - But you know he's involved in this. - I don't know that. We'll be in touch, Miss Markson. I'm sure you'll be hearing from your father's kidnappers and when you do, let us know. We'll do everything we can to help you. Mr. Slade? Don't get involved with this, unless you mean to cooperate. My local number's on the back of my business card. You call me if you find out anything relevant. (crickets chirping) - Let me go first, Jackie. Elias and his bunch may be watching your house. Nice and slow. You ready, John? It's okay, come on. - Did your father keep anything in the house? Anything dealing with work, papers, notes, anything. - Yeah. - Oh, hold on. - He keeps all his weapons and stuff in here. - A long ways to sit down. You can really do it with the stuff he's got in there. - Any work papers, videos, discs or anything would be in the desk. - I'm gonna burn this stuff right now. - Do it. (crickets chirping) (fire crackling) All he wanted to do was retire. (crickets chirping) (phone ringing) - Yes? - [Elias] Come to the Highlander Hotel today, three o'clock. - What, who is this? - [Elias] Just listen. There is a swimwear show in the main lobby. Come alone or we'll kill your father. - [Jackie] The Highlander Hotel. They want me there alone. - If you do go, they're gonna force your father to do whatever they want. - But if I don't go, they'll kill him. - He's worth more alive. - Ron, you know how he is. He would die before he would tell anybody anything. We have to do something. - Okay. Wear bright clothes, colors, yellow, red. So I can always see you. And you better go get changed. We've only got a couple hours. - Okay. Come here a minute, will you? I wanna talk to you. (gentle music) I guess you think I'm crazy for letting her go. - It's just a job for them. They're expendable and they know it. They'll kill them both if the deal goes sour. - And if he don't let her go, we'll never get Markson back. - We gotta get in on their plans and make sure you get taken a long with Jackie. - John, Jackie's my daughter. She doesn't even know it. Markson's her legal father. When I got back from Asia, we just decided not to tell her about it. Just seemed to work better all around if I'm her big-hearted, crazy, goddamn uncle. - Never told me you had a kid. - Yeah well, she is. But I don't want her to know. You've gotta know but not her. I was in that shithole, fece prison compound almost five years, and when I got out, all I did was re-up and then wash out on an undesirable. Then I fucked up some more, acting like some asshole balls for brains. - Yeah but you're as clean as anybody could be now. - Buddy, I was gone south and you know it with that shit storm war. Meanwhile, her mother's back here trying to forget I ever left her. Had her wondering if I'm dead or alive until the War Department finally gets around to telling her I am dead. Markson was great. He never let me down. He knew she loved me and not him. But he took care of her and Jackie, all that time. And then after eight years, I finally come back, broke, alcoholic, shellshocked, Agent Oranged-out, fucked up. My best friends are dead and I'm a piece of shit. I just want her safe and him safe. She's my daughter, for Christ sake. The only one I'll ever have. We'll take the truck, I can hide in back. (birds chirping) You be careful. Okay? - Okay. - Hey, Ron, stay undercover. - Oh God. - You know they're gonna be looking for you. - Cover me up. - I'm gonna stay here and see who shows up. Then I'll meet you at the hotel, I won't be far behind. - [Ron] Smells like shit under here. - Hold your breath. - Wait a minute. Park a few blocks away from the hotel. - Okay. - Not too close. - All right. - Like in the alley or something. (engine rumbling) Okay, let's go. (dramatic electric guitar music) (door creaking) (dramatic music) - [Willis] Yes? - The house is empty but I think I found something. - [Willis] Bring it all back here. - But it's all been burned. The video tapes, computer discs, everything and they left it all out like they knew we'd find it. - [Willis] Then get away from the house. - Yeah. - Who were you talking to? - Willis. FBI. (head thudding) (cop gasping) (birds chirping) (upbeat music) - Put your gun away. Put it under your coat or something. - I want everybody to see my gun. - I know you do. You know how to use it? - I use it everyday. - I know. (engine revving) - Is anybody watching us? - Nope. - Don't look at me. Now, put the keys on the seat and walk away and don't look back, I'll be right behind you. So long, honey. (upbeat music) - Roll down the window! - What? - Turn the radio off! She's here! Jackie's in the hotel! (festive horn music) - Okay, ladies, five minutes and then no more, that's it. (women chattering) (women laughing) - Oh my god. Ooh, la, la. I think I see my bonus. Woo! Want some flowers, honey? - Hey, who are you? - These are yours. - You're not supposed to be. - These are yours, honey. You smell good, come here. - Get away from me. - Do you want to smell it, baby? Come on. - Hey you, hey you, come on. You don't belong in here, let's go. - All right, all right. - Come on, come on. - All right, come on, honey, it's just you and me, come on. - I said, come on! - All right. All right, man. All right. (women chattering) (Carlos indistinctly speaking) - Come on. - You know, I got a real gun. - [Cop] What? (ominous music) (cop gagging) (people chattering) - Ladies and gentlemen, the Holiday Inn Highlander is proud to present a Summer Swimwear Spectacular. (upbeat music) Fashion from Eugenia at competitive prices. My name is Terry Anderson and I will be your hostess for today's event. (upbeat music) (audience applauding) (sinister tempo music) (birds chirping) (water bubbling) (upbeat music) - Jackie. (Carlos laughing) You're late. - What? Don't like the way I smell? Fertilizer's good, right? Makes the flowers grow. Phew. - You be a good girl, Jackie, or I'm gonna have to stick my gun in you. - I heard that. - Yeah? - You're a prick. - Leave it alone, Vanna. - Listen, you touch her and I'll tell Elias. He'll give her to me. (upbeat music) - You smell like shit, man. And this is a private party. Let's go clean you up. - Hey, don't be a hard-ass, huh? Okay, lighten up. - Elias tells me you're some bad shit motherfucker. - Elias, look, I had a lot of beginner's luck. Listen, Markson told me a lot about his new toy. I can help you guys. Let me make some money too, huh? - Okay, maybe so. Let's go see what Elias has to say. - Okay. (upbeat music) (ominous music) (gunshot booming) (women screaming) (gunshots booming) (people screaming) (gun cranking) - Ronald says he knows something about Markson's gizmo. - Did you hear that? - Bring Ron with you and bring them both to the staging area. But take your time in traffic. Don't get stopped. Have you seen Slade? (helicopter buzzing) (dramatic tempo music) (motor buzzing) This is Special Agent Willis. Put out an APB, John Slade.
