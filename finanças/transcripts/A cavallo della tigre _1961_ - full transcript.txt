Some say that jail is a prison For me, it's a holiday… Some say That the handcuffs are made of iron To me, they seem like gold bracelets Distinguished... attorney, my defender. As you requested, I am sending the following defense memorial, so that my name may be reinstated, after the infamy of the following accusations, accessory to escape, armed assault, kidnapping, cruelty to minors, blackmail and rape. I'll start from the beginning. June 4th. Or June 5th? June 4, 1959. The outskirts of Civitavecchia. Until that moment, although my wife belittled my modest salary, I was a good worker. A driver who honestly supported his family. ALUM MINES It isn't serious. Help! I was robbed! - Call the police! - Yes! Marshal, someone buried a briefcase full of money down there. He put a tree in the road and crashed his car. He hurt himself and tied himself with a rope. I saw everything. - What are you saying? - Marshal, down there… Because of the infamous clam fisherman, I got three years with no chance of an insanity plea, even though I was entitled to one, because I'd had epilepsy as a child. Despite this, I had obtained the position of assistant nurse, which all the prisoners refused, because it's hard work. - Sweeper. - Present. Assistant nurse. Jawhol, mein Führer! Lucky you! Wake up. Whoever spits on the floor will clean it up with his tongue. Last night I dreamed I was with Anita Ekberg. At the climax, I heard a roar, and she became a motorbike. Good morning. - Does it hurt? - No. - We can remove it. - Will I be able to move my hand again? I hope not. You got three years because of that movement. It's true. Maybe you're removing the cast, so that Tagliabue, who did this, will get out of solitary confinement? He's been there 28 days. Aren't you satisfied? Giacinto, the cutter. Sorry. When the weather changes I don't have cigarettes on me. - I said cutter! - Yes. - This one? - Yes. - Change the blade. - Yes. He deserves solitary confinement too. He held me while Tagliabue beat me. I was sleeping. - Knight, I'll wash your stuff? - Yes, very good. - Doctor, my arm is tingling. - Ants have gotten inside! - They're releasing him. - They're releasing Tagliabue! - Twenty-eight days of isolation! - He took his vows! He took them at the Santa Teresa basilica. Three silver hearts and a gold candlestick. Open. Tagliabue, get ready. If it's for a bath, forget it. I'll wash when I get out. That's why we are here. The Knight's arm is fine now. Did you like the vacation? Darn! It ended too soon. Next time I'll break both his arms. - Don't brag! - I can walk by myself. And so, lifetime prisoner Tagliabue, Campanacci, and Mr. Papaleo were reunited. Welcome, excellent friend. A gorilla, a rat and a cuckold who killed his fiancée's lover. The following day I was on duty and didn't suspect that all hell was going to break loose, so to say. A fly! It's a pulpitis. When did it begin? In solitary confinement. A month of humidity. The cavity is curable, but the dentist comes in a week. I can remove it. Thank you, but I'll wait. I have time. The pain will increase. - Giacinto, two pain killers. - Right away! Two pain killers. - The bedpan! - Right away! My kisses... You wash bedpans with those hands. I'll get them. Excuse me. It's not that I don't have faith in medicine... - A glass of water. - Yes. But put a clove in your tooth, my aunt taught me that. - Giacinto, the bedpan. - I'm coming. Get me a photo of a cell for four, from the photographer's room. A photo of a cell? Why? Why? I want to send a souvenir of where I am to my aunt. - They won't give it to me. - Sneak it out. Could I refuse? Tagliabue was serving his sentence for the murder of his accomplice who tried to kill him in order to keep the loot. Tagliabue chased him for 30 kilometers and killed him. The coroner counted 18 bicycle blows on his body. I didn't think his request for a photo would be dangerous, so I accepted. We don't need the bedpan anymore. Cerioni peed in his bed. - Check the packages. - Excuse me. A sweater, a pair of underwear, a chocolate bar, jam. You can't receive cigarettes. - The photo. - I understand. Get 20 suppositories of Bi-Valeas for us. - Do you have a sore throat? - You will if you don't find them. Campanacci. Rat, your package. Sender is Pagliuca Marilita, 21 Via del Traversone, Rome. - Marilita, 21 Via del Traversone. - Rossi Giacinto. - Here I am. - Why do you need all that tobacco? Sender, Picchioni Garibaldo, Civitavecchia. - So many socks! Are you a centipede? - Take this stuff away. - Clams. - The fisherman who reported me. He didn't know I committed that crime to feed my family. He asks for my forgiveness. - I don't want the clams. - Me neither. They are spoiled. To us! Comrade! Every evening I have thoughts of love for you The sea Is the voice of my heart It's the voice of your heart That unites us again My kisses to me, your kisses to you Are brought to us by the sea The sea Is the voice of my heart It's the voice of your heart That unites us again My kisses to me, your kisses to you Are brought to us by the sea The sea Hey, lousy singer! If you do an encore, you'll get the other shoe! Why do you do this? Out with the cigarette. I did the number. The number? It's number 100! It's not right. If you want the cigarette, sing "The Real Man" for me. - No, I won't sing it. - Then you don't smoke. - Giacinto. - Who's there? I'll give you a cigarette. Thank you. I have the stuff in my jacket. - What? - He has the stuff in his jacket. It's good. It tastes like barley sugar. - English tobacco. - Wow! Here's the ace. I'll trick you now. It's worth a cigarette. Watch out for the discard. Where is the ace? - Here. - No. Yes, it is. Let me see. - The cigarette. - No. - That makes four. - Giacinto. - Right away. - Change the eye pad. Ready. - Did you hurt yourself? - No. - I enjoyed myself. - That's a good one! Excuse me. What an engine! I made a nice one with cheese crusts. I wanted to take it to my son. It took me two months. But a mouse ate a wing and the tail. - Are you married? - Yes, with two children. - Poor things. - Two children. If you want to see them again, replace it with the real one... Yes. And bring it by the fountains. What? The object in the basin. That's the reason for the suppositories. With aluminum paper they'd made a copy of the cutter. Replace it with the real one. Understand? You'll say that I was weak on that occasion too. But that Papaleo was mean. Remember his offense? "A respected professional catches his fiancée in an intimate position with a man whom he kills with a rifle. He said he was sorry the rifle wasn't double-barreled. PICTURE TRIBUNE He'd have killed her too. Read the whole press report." Papaleo, what is it? Cell 98 is a mess. Rat has bronchitis, Tagliabue has a rotten molar and you fall out of bed. I was agitated last night. - Doctor, you must examine me. - I'd do as he says, to avoid any problems. I don't feel well. I think I have a fever. - The pulse is normal. - How much? Seventy-six. - Twenty-one, 22, 23… - Come on! …24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, - 35, 36. - Come on! Thirty-eight pulses. The warden does the round in half a minute. Meneghetti, the warden has got short legs. - He shouldn't take... - Are you a spy? No. I was passing by. - Well? - Here it is. Thank you. Now, don't bug me anymore! - Giacinto. - Yes? Giacinto. Giacinto. I'll be right there, sir. I gave you five cigarettes for the laundry, but it's not good. The clothes were all wrinkled. You should change more often. They're so dirty, they're stiff. What are you doing with your arm? My Giacinto, what I feared happened. The joints are ruined. That scum, Tagliabue! - They almost framed me too. - Who? Tagliabue? - And the other two. - What did they do to you? I had to find suppositories, a photo and an instrument. - What instrument? - Let's not use names. A cutter. That is why he broke my arm. To avoid having me in their cell, and to carry out who knows what plans. How much longer do you have left? Ten months, three weeks, four days and five hours. If I had you released six months earlier, would you be grateful? - Let's see. - Do as I say. - Yes. - Don't tell anyone I told you. Tell the director that you found out about an escape plan. - I see. - Know why? For that information, he'll sign for your good conduct, which will reduce your sentence. - You'll be home for Christmas. - Christmas? At home? Thank you, wonderful idea! Don't thank me. If things go well, it means that you'll keep washing my laundry. Wow. - Free of charge. - It's the price of freedom. - What? - A control. I was taken aback, my illustrious defender. A control. A surprise check. You surely realize what danger I was facing. If they caught those three with the cutter I'd be caught too, and therefore, accused. I was overtaken by anguish. Come up, another three. - What is it? - Venus in the bathroom. - Will you give it to me? - Yes. I want to touch up her rear end. - And then it's mine? - Yes. Go on. Another three. I must talk to the director immediately. What? Go on. I must talk to the director as urgently as possible. - Who are you? - Rossi Giacinto. At the thought of talking to the director, I felt like a new man, alive. But the sword of Dracula was already hovering over me. You smoke while you wash? It'll get wet. Shall I hold it for you? It tastes like barley sugar. It's English tobacco. I'm an expert. Who gave it to you? You never receive packages from outside. May I? - Take it. - Thank you. -What? It's not your stuff -No, it's yours. - Help! - What is he doing? He's killing me! - It's not worth it. - Help! He's killing me! - For a cigarette? - Help! He's killing me! - Help! - Silence! - Do you understand? Silence! - Here. Yes. - What is going on? - He wants to kill us all. - I didn't move. - I'll change your cell. - Do you have room? - They're filthy. They did that on purpose to have more room. Put me where you want. Everybody loves me. The cells are all full. - There is a free place. - Where? - The usual housing problem. - Yes. Thank you. Wherever you put me, I am fine. Good evening. It's the truth. This finch is cute. Hey, handsome, what's your name? It's nice to love animals. It's a sign of kindness. - It sings well. - It is blind. How did it happen? I blinded it. That's why it sings well. I sing well, too. Want to hear? What did you want to tell the director? Squealer! Silence! Understand? Silence! Assistant nurse. So… I don't want to talk to the director. It was just to say I won't be assistant nurse anymore. Why not? I feel as though I've been beaten. It was a volunteer job, and I don't want it anymore. - Nobody cares for me. - Good. I'll cancel it. I never knew why they made you a nurse. Because when I was in the military, I was in the health department. One day the colonel said to me, "Listen, Giacinto…" Excuse me. What was I saying? Nunzio Filogamo came to Civitavecchia for The Amateur Hour. I presented myself with three songs, but he told me that I wasn't cut out for it and to just forget it. Maybe if I'd been blind, I'd have sung better. It's the truth. They should have put you in an insane asylum. Yes. You always like to joke around. - Did he bother you? - No. If he bothers you, tell me. You see? They go from left to right, and from up to down. So you must saw diagonally in the opposite direction. We'll fill the hole with darkened bread and the sound won't change. - It's 100% guaranteed. - The hook? It must be cut here and here. What are your intentions with me? - You'll come with us. - Silence. You'll come with us. What did I say? - Why? - Just because. We can't risk you raising the alarm, we can’t do without that margin of indispensable time. - Besides that, you know too much. - Be quiet. You believe in the Madonna? Do it for her. I only have ten months left. But if I escape, my destiny will be a mess. My wife and children were evicted. Even the fisherman who reported me was touched. I am not lying. He wrote to me, "I didn't know you had to feed your family. Forgive me." I don't forgive squealers. I despise them. So go without worrying. I will stay here and not say thing. - I think you'll be a loudmouth. - No. - Not even if they beat you? - As silent as a fish. All right. We trust you. Tell us who gave you the idea of talking to the director. No, I'm not a loudmouth. It was the knight commander! You'll come with us. Two days later, on the 20th or 21st, maximum July 23rd, Rat received another package from that woman who I later found out was his concubine. It seemed like something ordinary, but it had its importance. Marilita sent dried figs and this stuff. - When is it? - We'll count them now. - Good. - What are you eating? - Just a dried fig. Come on, we're friends! - Just one? Two. Who cares? Didn't I share the cake they sent me with you? The number of figs indicates what day Rat's girlfriend is going to the appointment. - Where? - In the bunker on the railway. Excuse me, but you hide everything from me. - You are a burden. - You must not say that. I hurt myself for the sake of everyone. - You are not speaking as a friend. - Friend? Mr. Papaleo, you talk too much about this friendship. - What sort of friend are you? - Calm down. He is. A few words… Enough. You want the wardens to come? God makes them and couples them up. Enough. I say enough, dear southerner. You think you are important, because you have three degrees. The only reason you didn't get a life sentence is because you said it was an honor crime. In 11 years you'll go back to the good life. What do you know about my intentions? I'll get out, kill her, and return to this hell with my honor cleansed. The good life! If you could see inside of me, you'd feel horror and pity. What an actor! That's 23 figs, plus two makes 25. It's the day after tomorrow. You see, attorney? They would do their crazy gesture in two days. At night they never lost sight of me while they smoked lots of cigarettes made with a device that Rat created. A man with golden hands. It was useless to contact the wardens. Sunday at Mass I tried to confess to the chaplain, to tell him the truth, but they wouldn't let me, depriving me even of religious comfort. Are you sharpening a spoon? It could become a weapon. Spit. - What for? - For you, if you try anything. The wardens! One, two, three, four. What do you want? Don't hurt me. I thought they wanted to kill me, and that's it. I was about to say amen when I realized the reason was they didn't want me to know where they kept their tools. They had an arsenal of ropes made with socks, cardboard tubes and a gun. Change of shift. Wow! In two hours, freedom! Come on, get to work! - Work! - Yes. You escape. I won't come. I'd rather kill myself than be ruined. I'm not kidding. I'll blow my brains out. - It's made of breadcrumbs. - Cut. It's well made. - It looks real. - Cut. Yes. Tagliabue, we’ll go to the courtyard, you will open the manhole and we'll slip into the collector and come out the west side. - I get it. - Hurry. It's ten o'clock. Go! Rossi. What are you doing there? - Get dressed and come outside! - Me? Outside? Right away, superior! Thank you. This is the best day of my life. - Today is the 25th. - Go on. July 25th is the liberation of Giacinto from hell. You'll see. - Come on. - Where are you taking me? Hurry! - I am innocent. - Here he is. - What is it? - Do you know this? What is it? It's a fake cutter. - I want to talk to the director. - No, talk to me. Where is the real one? - I want the director. - Where did you find it? In the showcase. The last time it was used you were the nurse's assistant. Yes. I want to talk to the director. I'll tell the truth. - They'll go through the courtyard? - It's the truth. That is why they wanted the cutter. I wanted to tell you. I asked to talk to you. Ask him. Isn't that so, superior? Where are those two? In the cell they were in agreement to send me with the other three. There's the scum in cahoots with the other delinquents. - I found the cutting blade. - No. You speak because you have a mouth, but you're stupid. Are you in command? Director. He noticed the fake cutting blade and advised us. - Sure. - In fact. Anyone can say "in fact". Is it true there's a sewer manhole in the courtyard? What's it called? Collector. They want to go through it, up to its opening in the wall. Director, I wanted to do my duty. You will surely take my sincerity into consideration. You are talking to a serious person. I am the father of a family. Bear that in mind. - What is his offense? - Simulation of crime. - Take him back to his cell. - No. - No. - This is an absurd escape plan. It's the truth. Let me pledge an oath. Look. These are my loved ones, Director. She is my wife and these are the children. - This is Saint Anthony. - Take the sweeper away too. Director, if it's a lie, may I never see them again! It is the oath of a father, believe me. - I believe you, but go back to your cell. - Yes. They'll become suspicious. I want to catch them red-handed. - Do you want to help justice? - Yes, I do! Arrive early. Say that we called you to communicate a family affair. All right. Good idea! If what I said is right, could you ask for a permit for Christmas? I can't promise anything. Thank you. What? You can't promise? - Prepare the squad. - Yes, sir. She's dead. My wife, the day before yesterday. She died of... Of… My poor wife! No. What? - What? - You mouthed off. - No. - Yes. I didn't talk. May I never see my wife again! - You said she was dead. - Yes. No. No! I won't hurt you. Calm down. Did you confess to the director? Good for you. You did as we wanted. Come on, guys! - What? - Right. It was all calculated. - The sweeper who found the cutter? - Him too. He's in cahoots with us. Come on! - You are really crazy. - Yes. I understand now! Do you understand, attorney? They hid the stuff there. It's pouring! Where are you going? Wait for it to stop raining. Open cell 98. Stay back. With Tagliabue you never know. It's empty, Director. They tricked us. They took that young man. He was right. Let's stop them at the collector. - Marshal, sound the alarm. - Yes. - Ring the alarm! - Turn on the spotlights! To the west side! A squad outside. Come on, let's go. Lock the exits. You hear me? Nobody is here. The manhole is closed. They didn't come by here. Don't try to trick us or I'll strangle you. - Turn those spotlights on. Hey, you! - To the ground! Hurry up! Come out! With the rain they risk drowning in the conductor pipes. - Me? - You stay there. Pull me up or I'll scream. They'll take it out on me! Everyone down! Can you hear me? If the rain continues the water level will rise. Come out! - Stay there. - You are in a trap. If you give up, we'll consider that. Tagliabue, Papaleo, Campanacci, Rossi. - Let's go down that way. - No one is there! First Rat, you two, and then me. This is the rope you'll toss down at the end. - Don't do anything crazy! - I'm going down. What are you doing? Praying? Go down. Darn it! If you surrender, we'll take it into consideration. Come outside. You're trapped. If you surrender, the director will take it into consideration. You risk drowning. There is a hole in the ceiling of cell 98! It's all empty. A double ceiling and room for ten people. I said it was fishy. That scum threw us off track. He'll pay for it. Go out with the dogs. Go down to the ditch and then up to the railroad. Wait for me. Don't leave me! Tagliabue, Papaleo, Rat! You left me by myself. I don't know the way to the bunker. Where are you? Wait for me. Darn you! Damn it! No one is here. - Maybe she hasn't arrived. - Let's hope for the best. Let's get away from here and find shelter. - Is it her? - No. It's that idiot. How are you? - That moron will draw attention. - Where are you guys? - Oh! - Hey! - We are here. - I hear voices, but can't see you. Here. We are here. Don't call us! I didn't say any names. - Come. - I stole the clothes from a farm home. - Marilita didn't come? - No! - Was it today? - Today is the 25th. - You only ate two figs, right? - Yes. What do figs have to do with it? - Did you eat them too? - Yes, three. No, four. Why? Damn you! Tagliabue, kill him! Don't get angry. - Don't hurt me! - Pig! Not on my head. I'm weak. I had an illness. An illness, on the Greek-Albanian front. Have mercy. Mercy for those who fall. Kill me, but don't hurt me. - No! - Enough! - Thanks, Tagliabue. You're a friend. - Friend? Worm. You're not a friend. You're a spy. That word is dead for you. You can't even say it! - One must risk for everyone. - In what sense? We need clothes and a car to reach Marilita. Right. Out with the money. - I have 10,000 lira in my shoes. - Good. I have five. That makes 15. Papaleo? I don't know. I'll look. - The gun. - No. It's not right. It's my turn. - You've already done too much. - No. I'll go. As you wish. Here. It may be useful. Bye, Rat. Darn it. They screwed Rat or he'd be back by now. He sacrificed himself. It's not a sacrifice to fall in the name of a principle like friendship. And honor is one of the most precious human requisites, whatever the materialists, known as Marxists, may say. Right. Darn it! Could I have ended up worse than this? - With a nuisance and an idiot. - What'll we do? Without Rat we are dead. What'll you do without him? We don't know where that woman lives. - I knew the address. - He said he knows. - You know where she lives? - I can't remember now. Make an effort. Snap out of the spell! Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Ancus Marcius, Tullus Hostilius… I never remember the other three. - Twenty-one Via del Traversone. - Are you sure? I heard it during the package distribution. All right. Let's look for some clothes. Servius Tullius, Tarquinius Priscus, Tarquinius Superbus. Who are they? ROADWORKS - Good morning. - Did you see anyone? No. Who would come? - Are you making jam? - Yes. - Where are your folks? - They're in the fields. Who are you looking for? - Is he your child? Let me see him. - No. He'll get scared. - Nobody is here. - We'll look close by here. - I soiled you. - It doesn't matter. - Be careful. They are bad boys. - Don't doubt it. It's hot! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Nini! What did you do to him? You must change him. He peed. - Be quiet or… - Cowards! Give me a hand. Stop! I've always liked a warrior woman. - Will you help me hold her? - This is madness. - Go, southerner. - Come on. She hurt me. - Mom is here. - Sorry for the bother. Scoundrels! She was so afraid! - You wouldn't kill the child. - What? - You wouldn't kill him. - I would, if she talked. Darn it! People are all traitors and scum, but they love children. - That is where we must hit. - Right. When that boy grows up he could become a policeman. Do you realize what sort of delinquents they were? We're undercover now, we must find a means of transportation. Come on, let's go! It is a prestigious car. If my wife saw me, what a face she'd make. It has a two-speed windshield wiper. One and two. - What a... - Down, idiot. You too. Let them by. Nobody is behind us. Go ahead. - The vehicle registration. - The police! - Do you come from Milan? - Yes. - Did you stop on the way? - In Florence, for gas. - Why? - Nothing. Go on. We stopped after Treviglio. You wanted to tell them that we picked up a prostitute? - Hey! It's all over. - He fainted. - What is it? - Nothing. Excuse me. Papaleo? He went to carry out his revenge. If they don't catch him before, he'll be in the papers tonight. I'm hungry. - Olga! - What do you want? Are you coming? Dance With Us is on. No. I'd prefer to freshen up. Who is it? Ciccillo! - You stabbed me. - It's just a spoon. Darn this spoon! - Ciccillo. - That nickname is dead. I'm the one dying. - See? You hurt me. - Hurt you? - What did you do to me? - Olga, what happened? - Answer. - It's nothing. I was pulling down the suitcase and it fell on my head. - Are you stupid? - I failed my resolution. - Alcohol. - Alcohol? There, in the drawer. Life in prison? It doesn't matter. What life is this? Nobody ever liked me, not since I was born. Was your lover pleasant, with that pipe? It burns. - Do you have bandages? - Yes, in the box. They must be looking for you. I will turn myself in, like I did back then. But this time… I am such a coward! Dear. What is there between us for you to use a word like that? Who knows how much you suffered? You want to eat something? Can you imagine me with such a material need… at a moment like this? Leave my hand alone. You've lost weight, you're thin. Wait. These are the special ones we make for ourselves. - What are they? - Meatballs. Try them. I make them for the personnel. Please. You don't know what I went through when I left town! Finally, the countess found me this job as a cook. Refuse? Who else would have helped me? They are like the prison ones. There is garlic in here, right? No, it's parsley. Really? I would have put some garlic in. They are good. I learned to cook for you and not for these brats. - Mom spent time teaching me. - Where is she now? Here with me. She works in the kitchen too. I can't tell you what assignment she has. A bad star hovers over us. At the same time, that madman and I headed for 21 Via del Traversone in traffic that had increased during our absence. You may say, "Giacinto, you are clever, why didn't you leave him alone?" What do the Chinese say? At that point I was on the tiger's back. It's dangerous, but it's even more dangerous to get off, because it'll eat you. - It's a movie theater. - It's number 21. Must be upstairs. - Miss Marilita? - Yes. - May we come in? - Who are you? - Rat's friends. - Very intimate ones. - Why are you here? - The escape was successful. - You didn't know? - No. The appointment was the 29th. It's his fault. He ate the figs! - Anyway, we made it. - Yes. But they caught Rat. What? How did it happen? I don't know. It's the truth. - Yes. - Poor Gigino. His heart was in it. Last time he said that if they caught him, - I should come here… - Twenty-one Via del Traversone. To ask you for anything we needed and you'd give it to us. DOUBLE ESCAPE PLAN TO DECEIVE THE DIRECTOR - Isn't that true? - Yes. - He said that? - His exact words. He is a real friend. Tagliabue, we're in the paper here. "Double escape plan to deceive the prison director, who stated…" Listen to what he says. "I believed that Rossi Giacinto…" He's talking about me. "He was of mediocre intelligence, but instead it was all part of his plan, one that he created and directed, to hide his criminal intent." - I'm a subordinate to you? - I didn't write it. Your comb. - I saw Rat make this device. - I know. He had hands of gold. Would it be too much if I kept it as a souvenir? No, no. - Thank you. - People say that life is strange. He is in prison and his tool is here. Yes. - Where is he? - What do you want? Go away! Who is he looking for? Where is he? If I find him, I'll kill him. Out, you filthy pig! Oh! Is he here? - I will surely find him! - Nobody is here. Where is he? Where are you? Help! Scoundrel! Coward! Traitor! Let me explain. The police were after me. - Rather than... - Are you afraid? It's made of crumbs! I beg you. Please. I'll give you all I have. I have 300,000 lira. Half each. There's two of us now. You are a sewer. There's three of us. - There's the imbecile too. - Thank you. Did they hear? Could it be the police? Open it. Say that nobody is here. Let's hide outside. - What'll I say about the shot? - That it was the gas container. I have electric heaters! Good day. - Are they here? - Nobody is here. Don't be suspicious. I am Rat's friend. Why did you come here? I see with pleasure that you made it too. I thought about it and I changed my mind. - So much the better. - Where did you come from? Together again, friends. The bad star is leaving us. - We are with you too. - We, who? Come, Olga. Here. Olga, my fiancée. - Mr. Tagliabue. - My pleasure. My friend Giacinto. This lady is my fiancée's mother. - It's hot, huh? - The stairs. There's also Rat. Where did he go? Maybe to the bathroom. His gun. He isn't stupid! - Run! Go! - Run! I'll hold them back. Were they watching your fiancée's house? We should've killed her. I am astounded. - Ciccillo! - Hurry. Let's go! We can't get through here. Let's go back. - Push. - No, pull. Let's use the movie theater roof. See if we can get through there. Ciccillo, my suitcase. Oh, God! Come on! What are you doing? Don't leave us. They'll catch us. Your mother is holding us back. I'll join you and write to you. - One is over there. - Ciccillo! Take the girl away. She fainted. - Did you call an ambulance? - Yes, sir. - Remain calm. - Let's go to the other side. We ran away, getting ourselves into various escapades. A basement, a drainpipe and a cart of rubble. On the dawn of the 30th, we were desperate, in a rural area. - Get down. - What is it? Search him. - How much have you got in your pocket? - Nothing. Three thousand lira. Here it is. I go around without money because I live in the area. - Where? - There. See the electricity wires? - There is a town there. - Do you have money at home? Sure. I have some. Go home and bring me 300,000 lira. Your daughter stays here. - Three hundred thousand? - Nothing less. If you try to trick me, I'll take it out on your girl. Yes, sure. - We'll be waiting for you. - Don't move. Understand? Get going. Go on. Understand? - Do you like blackberries? - Yes. - What is your name? - What do you care? Marcella. - What does Dad do? - He's a miner. - At the alum mines in Tolfa. - No. Coke. Coke? No, silly. What are you saying? - That's not here. - My father is in Charleroi. - Where? - In Charleroi. - In Belgium. - Who is he then? I don't know. I asked him for a ride. He's going to buy eggs from Menicuccio up in town. Damn it! - He wasn't your dad? - Come. Bye. The last attempt to get money had failed. I proposed we go to Civitavecchia. I knew stowaways board ships over there. I knew the famous repentant clam fisherman. "He'll help us," I said to myself. Come on, you nuisance. - I want water. - Who will give it to me? A drop. Frogs. - So? - If there are frogs, there's water. Come on! Water! Water is so good! - It's even better than wine. - Come here. Are they after us? They're spraying gas on us. Don't breathe. It stinks! Don't drink. It's poison, for the mosquitoes. With all the fleas on us, it'll be a massacre! Leave me alone. I can't go on. What about me? You're not carrying me, I'm carrying you. Go to the clam fisherman. I'm staying here. - Maybe there's a chance I'll die. - Giacinto. - Giacinto, there's the sea. - Where? I don't see it. Yes, the sea. Look. Wow! The sea! - We made it! The sea. - It's the voice of my heart. What are you doing? Taking me in your arms? Let's walk on the road. It's more comfortable. Always straight. Hurry! Run! Fisherman! Garibaldo! Garibaldo, my friend. - Who are you? - It's me. - I don't know you. - I'm Giacinto. You destroyed me. - You are so ugly! - The police are chasing us. You must hide us. Have us sent to the Far East. While the fisherman was looking for what we asked of him, he hid us in an iron ship that was abandoned under the sun, during that long, hot summer. You're not eating the clams? They stink. Yes, they stink. Shall I throw them away? Darn it! It burns. The sun shines there. It was cooler in prison. Freedom is better. Sure! Of course it is! Will you give me a piece? - Of what? - What are you eating? - Nothing. It's swollen. - Sure, your tooth! Does it hurt? - Who is it? - Me. Who else? - What did you bring? - Clams. They're coming out of our ears. We're thirsty. You could've brought water. - I forgot. - Any news? I found a boat you can board, but it leaves tomorrow evening. It goes ashore at Port Said in Africa. That is the good news. The sailor wants 200,000 lira. That is the bad news. If you'd have told us that, you'd have saved your breath. 200,000 lira? - Who will give it to us? - Giacinto. I am sorry that I hurt you. I made a vow. I gave you the clams. What do you want now? - You want me to find you money? - I didn't say that! The Turkish sailor wants the money or he won't help you. - Goodbye. See you tomorrow. - Garibaldo. Don't bring any more clams, bring an omelet with chicory. Goodbye. Did you hear that? Who'll give us 200,000 lira? - I have no friends or relatives. - Right! My wife. I could try. Garibaldo. Garibaldo. - What? - Come here. - I must ask you a favor. - What a nuisance! The good man took me to my family that had been evicted and was living five kilometers from Palidoro. Listen carefully. Listen carefully. From this moment up until the end, what I tell you must remain a secret until we die, since the lives of four people are involved. Keep the secret. Understand? Ileana. It's me, Giacinto. You think I didn't recognize you? Go away. You want to ruin me again? Go away. Ileana, let me explain. This isn't your home, nor mine. I am a guest. They evicted us from the house we had. What are you looking for? Who are you? Everything in the world changes, but she had changed too much. It seems like the wedding was only today. The daughter of a teacher, the students participated on her wedding day. She was so young that she seemed like one of them. A sunny, happy day, that is only a memory during these disgusting days. - Ileana, what happened? - Good evening. - My husband... - I know. - Thank you. - Quiet. The children are sleeping. - Yours? - Hers. - Then they are mine. - Stay here. This isn't your home. Where are they? Don't wake them up. Duilio is getting a big nose. - What's in here? - The bathroom. - There? - The kitchen. The boy takes after his grandfather, he had a nose this big. - Where do you sleep? - Yes. Yes. Have you forgotten that you've been in prison three years? I lost my job. I've been a servant. I ruined my health to buy bread. Who took care of the children? Who fed them? Who cured Marinella when she got pneumonia? - Speak up. Who? - I don't know. You should thank Mr. Coppola that we are alive. You should kiss the ground he walks on. Calm down. - Understand? - Yes. - I'll explain. - There is nothing to explain. He's the one who should be ashamed, because Mr. Coppola deprived himself of food to give it to your children. Look. Look at what he has become. He is sick with silicosis. He lost everything. His home, the furniture, he's got debts, sold his watch. He built this shack. He's on state aid. He gets 10,000 lira a month. Another person in his place would've shot himself. Not him. He has a heart and is a real father. He is a worker, not a slacker, delinquent, scoundrel, good for nothing. He is my life. - What disease do you have? - Silicosis. - What's that? - I was working at the furnace. Glass tiles. The silica dust inflames the lungs. Wow. Giacinto, you can't fool me. - I know why you came. - What? - You came to ask for money. - Me? You're crazy! He came to ask for money. - No luck here! - Go away, Giacinto. You want the police to come here? You'll ruin me forever. Before going to jail, I'll report you, for sure. - The children. - That way I'll get the reward. Look. Pretender, robber, attempted rape and cruelty to a minor. What attempted rape? She was a hillbilly who gave us clothes. I didn't do it. You think I rape children? I don't know why they wrote that. I don't know. It's the truth. Marinella! Who is he? An uncle from America. He is leaving now. - How much is the reward? - One million. Wow! You've never earned that much in your life. - They wouldn't give it to you. - Why not? - A wife can't testify. - Laws are made by men! Women can only raise children. Only someone who isn't a relative can report him, a stranger. - I'm just saying. - Sure. What would it solve? You know all too well. We have debts of almost 400,000 lira. It's 500. The boy has to go to Immacolatella, the boarding school. With the tuition, clothes and other things, it'll cost 150,000. - Boarding school? - The stuff at the pawn store, the eviction, the furniture... With a million you paper over the cracks, but you don't solve the problem. He'd sacrifice himself and go to jail for a sum that doesn't solve our problems. What's that got to do with it? Nobody wants to sacrifice him. It was for the kids. Where are you going? - I... - Staying here is ridiculous. I mean, it's impossible. Your husband is intelligent. He knows it's a matter of hours. They'll catch him. And some son of a bitch will get the reward. It wouldn't be right. Don't you think? - I don't know. - It's useless. There's no… - In fact. There's no... - I agree. In fact… if I could get Cenciarella... - The boarding school? - No, that's Immacolatella. - Cenciarella is the furnace. - Yes. The owner would give it away. He can't run it anymore. He's sick. - Silicosis? - Diabetes, a rich man's disease. I see. If my cousin and I buy the furnace with 900,000 lira each, that's a good deal. - It should be worth double. - No. - Or… - Or what? The other guy. Sooner or later they will catch him. Where is he? Who? Tagliabue? One million for you and one for him. Where is he? - What does he have to do with it? - You're protecting that murderer? - He is a friend. - Giacinto. - Tell me something. - Yes. What is worth more? Your family or a friend? Family, of course. But it is a shame. It is a shame. Here, Giacinto. He fell asleep like a kid. - How old is he? - Forty. I gave up, and we agreed I'd return to the ship like nothing happened. Coppola was to report us. I was supposed to do nothing, except be surprised when the police came. It was difficult to pretend, because I felt like Judas. Actually, worse. Tagliabue. Tagliabue. It's me, Giacinto. - Are you ill? - I am cold. What? It's blazing hot. Here. Here is a shirt. Cover up. - Let me see. - Don't touch me. It seems better. It's not as swollen. - Did you see your wife? - Yes. The money? - What? - The money. It's there. What time is it? - Did you bring it? - No. It's taken care of. Ileana is going to look for it at some friends' and bring it. - See if the ship is still there. - Right away. - The Turkish ship is waiting for us. - Good. Giacinto, where is Port Said? I don't know, but what do you care? It is where it is. Italians abroad are always honored. - Listen. - Yes. - Do me a favor. - Sure. Pull out this disgusting tooth. - How will I do that? - Pull it out, damn it! All right. Wait. - Who is it? - Guess! Hold it. - What are you doing? - I'm disinfecting it. Let me do this. I'm a nurse. Give it to me. Open. You asked me to. Don't yell. They'll hear us. Open your mouth. Which tooth hurts? Are you sure? Yes. Open wide. Open wide. It's nothing. Open wide. Be quiet! What are you doing to him? Murderer! Leave him alone! - His tooth. - Wow! Have some wine. - Rinse. - If he yells, everyone will come. This is worse than the tooth. I'm sorry to say it. The sailor wants double. He knows about the reward. - What reward? - I don't know. A million each. The Turkish sailor wants 400,000. - That son of a... - Be quiet. - Let's not be fussy. - About what? If your wife's money is enough for you, you can start over. I can't. - You leave, I'll stay. - What's that got to do with it? - Do as I say, imbecile. - Yes. - What'll we do about the money? - In exchange… - do me a favor. - I'd even do two. If you have another boy, give him my name. Mario? Right. It's a bit ordinary. You can't tell them you did it for me. - It doesn't matter. - I'll call him Tagliabue. - Tagliabue Rossi. It sounds good. - If it's a girl? So what? - Tagliabuelle! It isn't bad! - Don't make me laugh. - The police. Who talked? - I didn't! - He did! I'll kill you! - Are you crazy? - I'll kill you! - Help! You coward. I will kill you! I will kill you, you'll see! - Help! - Leave that pig alone! - Let me kill him! - Let's jump. Can you swim? - We'll swim away. Jump! - Yes. Idiot. Are you afraid? Go on. Oh, God! Stop! Don't move! Don't shoot. I declare myself a prisoner. Come out. Move it. Surrender. Drop your gun. Come. Come on! It didn't go well. Some other time. Bye, my friend. The mastermind behind the escape has been arrested. Rossi is exhausted. How did you get the idea for the escape? How did you fool the director? I liked being in jail. One day the knight commander said to me, "Do as I say." "Report the criminal plan and you'll be home for Christmas." - For a man with children… - Who are you talking about? Speak freely… - Rossi seems... - Let's go. The sea Is the voice of my heart It is the voice of your heart… I ask you to do a good job at the trial. I have no money to pay you, but a lot of trust. I'll skip the rest and sign. Your esteemed Rossi Giacinto. END
