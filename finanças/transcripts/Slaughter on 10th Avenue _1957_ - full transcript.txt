[ Whistle ] [ Car horn ] He'll be right down. Don't gulp it, honey. He'll wait. Here you are. So long, sexy. Go on. Beat it. Come on, Pudsey. Let's take our shower. Get him off of me. Oh, my god. Solly. Cockeye did it. Cockeye Cook and two of his meatballs. Rysdale. Uhuh. Yes, I see. Would you repeat the address please? Okay. I got it. A longshoreman was just shot over on Tenth Avenue. Is Andy Anderson on this morning? - He's scheduled. Good. He knows the waterfront. Andy, come in here right away. Vic. The important thing in this one. Is to first establish the exact time of the knifing. That gives credibility to the witness's statement that he saw the incident. After that, here is what I want you to do. Bill, I am sorry. I cannot talk to you now. I took Anderson's shift. His baby is sick. Weren't you on all day yesterday? - That's right. Vic? - Sorry. I can't. I go to the Grand Jury at eleven. I am due to appear at Magistrate's Court at ten. Rose, is Keller in yet? "He called in and said he was delayed at the Coroner's Office." What is it, Howard? Someone just emptied a gun into a longshoreman. I'll take it. I have to catch one of those sooner or later. I guess maybe you are right. 359 Tenth Avenue. Right. - Bill. These waterfront cases have a tendency to get .. Involved. What I mean is, there's a lot under the surface. Let's just see what it is all about. We'll let the cops do the work? - That's right. Alright. Is the victim dead? - No, sir. But he is very weak. - Who is in charge? Lieutenant Vosnick. I am Bill Keating. DA's office. Who is the man that was shot? His name is Solly Pitts. He's the hiring boss on Pier W. Is he in any condition to talk? - I haven't seen him. He was on his way to the hospital when I got here. Well, let's get down there and get his statement. You knew to the office? A couple of months. Any idea what it is all about? Down at the docks Solly is what they call a 'rebel'. Mrs Pitts. Would you care for some coffee? No thank you. Hello Madge. - Hi, Tony. How is he? They won't let us in. They won't tell us anything. What is it, a military secret? If he is going to die I'd like to know. On the way down in the ambulance he kept biting his lip to stop from hollering. The slugs must have burnt him like red-hot pokers. They must have rubbed garlic on them, the creeps. Did you see anything, Mrs Pitts? This is Mr Keating of the DA's office, Madge. How do you do. Did you see anything? Tony, can I talk to you? Sure, Madge. Excuse me. Can I use your phone, sister? Surely. - Thank you. May I speak with Miss Pauley please? Dee? Hi, honey. Bill, the showing starts in 20 minutes. I hoped you would be here by now. I'm sorry, honey. I can't make it. I caught an assignment. Well. Bill, you have the address to that apartment. When can you take a look at it? Dee, this one is important. Well, I tell you what. Meet me there about 2 o'clock. That's wonderful, Bill. I'll be there at 2 sharp. Oh. I'd better go now, honey. Bye. Captain. How long will it be before we can see .. - Keating. Go ahead, Madge. Tell them what you just told me. After I heard the shots I ran downstairs to him. He said: 'Cockeye did it'. 'Cockeye Cook and two of his meatballs'. Those were his words. I heard him clear. - Cook? Eddie Cook. Ex-con. Runs the Pier Loaders Union. He's the boss of the loading racket at the downriver piers. All but Solly's. Solly runs his on the square. Cook has been trying to take over. I heard they had a scramble last week and Solly tossed him into the river. It is alright for you to see him now, Mrs Pitts. Thank you. Come on, Benjy. Solly honey. Lieutenant, you pick up this man Cook. I will meet you at The Tombs. We'll make up a short affidavit to hold him on. Okay? - Okay. The Doc says you are doing real good. Bee stings. They can't hurt you with bee stings. You are too tough. Yeah. I am tough. Too tough. Madge, in case I go there won't be much money. What are you talking about 'go'? - Madge, listen. Big John owes me fifty .. Maxi. A week ago I loaned him 20. He'll try to welsh on it but don't let him. Solly, please. Angie will help you with the money and Tony Vosnick will help you too. Who is that? - It's alright, honey. Mr Pitts, I am Bill Keating from the DA's office. I want to ask you a few questions about what happened this morning. You ready, Stu? - Right. Will you give me your name please. Your name? Solly Pitts. Address? 359 Tenth Avenue. Apartment 4D. You know that already. Please, Mrs Pitts. 359 Tenth Avenue. Apartment 4D. Who shot you, Mr Pitts? Can you hear me? - Yeah. Alright. Who shot you? - I don't know. Mr Pitts, I don't believe you understood me. Who shot you? - I don't know. I hear Eddie Cook shot you. - Who said? Your wife. - How can she? She don't know. You told her. - I told her? She is mistaken. It wasn't him. Mr Pitts, do you know Eddie Cook? I know him. Did he ever threaten you? - No. Was he trying to get you to move over? - He knows better than that. Why don't you leave me alone. Then why did you tell your wife he shot you? I didn't tell her nothing. If he shot me I'd say so. Honest. You had better get the doctor. I don't feel too good. Good luck. Yeah, you too. Keating, I've been through hundreds of the waterfront murders. I'm still waiting to see one solved. You guys keep trying but they all wind up walking on glue. Mrs Pitts, when you talked .. - Sorry. I'm in a hurry. I must home, get changed and come back as soon as I can. Let's go, Madge. Mrs Pitts, please. Let me drive you home. That's okay. We can walk. - Now, wait a minute. You said you were in a hurry. I'd like to take you home. Alright. That's right. I pick him up every morning. Solly has been my best friend for years. Would you say you stopped about here? About. A good view of the building entrance. - I told you I was dozing off. You said you were reading the paper. - I was reading the paper. Dozing off. Well, I just thought it possible you saw someone and didn't realize who it was. Yeah? Well, I didn't see a thing. Come on, Madge. Mrs Pitts. - Thanks for the lift. No fuss, no noise. Everything real good and quiet, Al. That's the way it ought to be. They're sore. I got some boiling inside. But nobody said nothing. Sure they're sore, Gussy. I understand. But unfortunate things happen in life. That's no reason to slow down work. Look at that. Sam. I think the local ought to do something for Solly's wife. In case he croaks, I mean. You bring it up at the next meeting. - Okay. I'd like to talk to some of the men. Help yourself, Chief. - Thank you. I suppose you men heard that Solly Pitts was shot this morning. I heard he and Eddie Cook had a fight here and Solly threw him off the pier. No kidding. I am asking you. Don't ask me. I wouldn't know. Is that right? The first I've heard about it. Do you know Solly Pitts? Never heard of him. Look out! No problem, boss. Hey. Come here you guys. Listen to me. Remember what happened to your pal? Come here, Mickey. Cliff. Comer here, I say. Big Bob McCloy. Lord have mercy on him. Dead in a lime pit. With a busted back. That runt Midget. Five foot nothing and all of a mouth. Christie Jack. Chinese style. Bullet in the back of the head. With the car radio up loud. Take it easy, Midget. Dahlke is around. In the river! With a steel rope for a necktie. Solly Pitts. That man was good. Turned into a sieve. In his own hallway. A little guy. All my life I've hated little guys. Some day I'm going to pull his tongue out. Natty Nolan. Two kneecaps busted. With a sledgehammer. Oh no you don't. Stay out of it, Ralphie. What do you want? I don't know you. My name is Bill Keating. DA's office. - Yeah? Then you stink. Midget. Midget. You didn't pay. Put it on the account. If a man says I stink. I guess I've got a right to find out why. Looks, mister. I ain't bothering you. Why bother me? You have got a complaint against those men, if you want to file it. Alright. I will think about it. See you later, cop. I am no cop and you know it. My job is to investigate the shooting of Solly Pitts. I think you can help. What kind of help do you want? You want I should say Solly shot himself? I want the truth. - You guys rupture me. You come sniffing around saying you want the truth. Then you run away further from us. Try me. Okay. Where were you when Big Bob, Christie and Red the Mick got taken? Before my time. I wasn't with the office then. But you are with it now. Okay. Where are you on paydays when guys get kicked back? Huh? And where are you when the loan sharks smell up the place .. Collecting ten percent each week? Because a guy needs eats, huh? And where are you Dahlke works short gangs? So he can rake in the pay for men that don't get hired, eh? Where are you? - We've got a racket bureau, Midget. I am homicide. Boy, you stink. So Dahlke has got you on his payroll, eh? Each week you get a sick note. In one of those brown envelopes. That poor slob Solly Pitts. Waiting for someone like you to square his beef. Do you know who shot him, Midget? I do. Eddie Cook? What do you care? The way some people tell it Solly is a racket man himself. He got what he deserved. I'll kill you! I am sorry, Midget. I take back what I said. Give me that. Alright, Midget. If you ever feel like talking I'll be around. Get out of here you stink-bug. Solly has been my friend for years. We've never had no trouble. Give me the socks. Keep your underwear. When something happens on the docks the blame falls on me. Hey, when are you going to lay off? I'm a legitimate business now. How does it make the union look? Save your breath, Cockeye. - The name is Eddie. Eddie Cook. Sure it is .. Cockeye. Hello, Mr Keating. This big-shot here is Eddie Cook. The man doesn't look like much in his underwear does he. Cockeye don't look much anyhow. Just another louse. Vosnick, someday you're going to get yours. Someday they are going to break you good. We'll run a spectrograph on the clothes to see if they have any powder burns. Of course, Cockeye has had plenty of time to change. Well? I've told you twenty times. You have no cause for pulling me in here. Would you mind telling me what you did this morning, Mr Cook? No. At seven-thirty I .. Got out of bed, saw my kids off to church at the school. At eight o'clock. I had breakfast with my wife. At eight-thirty. I left the house for the union office. Hey, what time did they say Solly was shot? I've watched that thug and his bums in operation for the last ten years. They make me feel like throwing up. He hires them to help with his killings. How many? I bet even he has lost count. I can't hold Cook, Lieutenant. Not even on a short affidavit. When I got in to see Solly Pitts he refused to name him. Look. Look, Solly and I have been friends all of our lives. I worked with him on the docks before I went to the department. Never once has he tipped to me about his troubles on the docks. Do you know why? Because he is 'Waterfront'. They don't take their problems to the cops. Yeah. I got a briefing on that from a guy named Midget. Well, he should know. He spilled his guts to some so-called Crime Commission. And all it earned him was a busted back. That didn't stop his fight. Nothing does. Note even when he lost his wife and two kids. After twenty years of watching him bang his head against stone walls .. She couldn't stand the blood. I guess I could hold him as a material witness. It is strictly up to you. Alright. A material witness. That gives us 48 hours to build a case. If we come up empty handed I will have to let him go. And I'll have to cancel my hospital appointment. I was going in Monday with a compressed vertebra. As long as I am in on this I want to give it my full time. You had better give it more than that. It's all over if Solly doesn't change his statement. Maybe you and I can't get him to. But Madge can. Yeah. If he doesn't die first. It's got plenty of closet space. See, I thought we'd put the couch over here. And. Maybe a buffet in this corner. And Helen said she'd help me out with the curtains. I think it's very nice. - Yeah. I think so. And you can see the edge of the park from this window. If you get up on your toes. Hey. Huh? Oh. I'm sorry. The case? - Yeah. I was just thinking how Pop used to take me to union meetings when I was a kid. He was an official in The Coal Miners Local. He lived and died unionism. If he saw the set-up here I think he would kill someone. If we ran into an Eddie Cook there the process was simple. We handled it in our own way. I had two broken fists by the time I was eighteen. I guess you wouldn't mind breaking one again. For a good cause, I mean. Does it show that much? You don't get rid of the coal mines quite so easily. Well, six years at law school and a white collar is supposed do the trick. And your belief in the law. So, why don't you just keep these in your pockets, huh? Honey. About this apartment. - Yes? If you like it, take it. Well, it's pretty expensive. - Now, wait a minute. Do you like it? Yes. Alright. I'll call Revered Clark and make arrangements. It's about time I got more time with you. Well, if you didn't you would have a nervous wreck on your hands. And you New England girls are supposed to be so reserved. This New England girl is reserved. For you, darling. Am I breaking up something? Hello Sid. Your office said I would find you here. So, this is the future Mrs Keating? Yes. Dee Pauley - Captain Sid Wallace. You'd never know it but he was a cop. He heads up a private detective agency. Well, please don't hold that against me. It is a living. Had lunch? - No. Would you mind joining me? It's about the Pitts thing. Not at all. Fine. I .. just had a talk with Eddie Cook in his cell. Oh? Poor Eddie. If you got a criminal past it hounds you all your life. Tough. Especially since he does so many favors for people. Let's go over to the China Boy. The best fried shrimp in town. Yeah. Just a matter of time before someone caught that Solly Pitts. How do you mean? Didn't Vosnick tell you? Just two months ago Pitts took after a fellow named Toby Zirk. He creased his skull with a slug from a 0.38. It's in the record. A good thing Zirk is so thick-headed or he'd be dead. You .. Like fried shrimp, Miss Pauley? Jimmy Wan makes the greatest. Captain Wallace. - Hello Sam. Got a table for three? - Yeah. Come this way. Got a nice booth. Glad to see you again, Captain. - Thank you. Oh Bill. Someone I'd like you to meet. Excuse us please. Al. Bill Keating. Al Dahlke. Sit down, fellah. - Bill. Bill is the fellow who tossed Eddie Cook into the can. Want some chow? Take a rib. They make them with some kind of palm sauce. No thanks. - Go ahead. Don't be bashful. What are you, new around here? Sort of. Well, what do they pay you guys now? 80 bucks a week? Jeez, the city will go bust. What you guys need is a good union. I get free tickets to the fights. Bill. Al and I have been friends for a long time. Tell him how we met, Sidney boy. He'll get a kick. I was in a safe loft. I killed Al's best friend trying to take a hardware store. In broad daylight. Jerk. I took Al in too. When the judge found out the company he'd been keeping .. Whee .. right back inside. Parole violation. We've been great friends ever since. Didn't Sidney do me a big favor? You know, fellah. That stretch made an Honest John out of me. I'd be a jerk not to be grateful. Hey, Charlie. - Sir? Give me one of those towels, will you. Thanks. You know, that's the trouble with ribs. Afterwards you need a bath. Some people even need it before. Al .. I talked to Eddie Cook. He said that Bill here treated him like a gentleman. Yeah? That's okay. You know that Eddie Cook is a good friend of mine. Like a brother. Do you know why? Because he came through for me. When I first took him on he was nothing. He didn't have means to eat. I said: 'Eddie you're a no-good bum'. 'But if you want to be an Honest John like me I'll help you out'. I get a kick from taking kids who get into trouble and straightening them out. Now Eddie is a good boy. A top-grade union official. A credit to his job. Me, I got a kick. I had faith. Oh, that Eddie Cook is a nice fellow, Bill. He does lots of favors for people. Look Sid, I don't want to keep Dee waiting. Yeah. Yeah, Bill. The girlfriend, Al. A real knockout too. They are getting married. Yeah? Yeah, that's okay. Bill. Bill is alright, Al. Let me tell you he is okay. Well, excuse me, fellows. I got to call in. Yeah. See you, Sid. Sure, you are okay, Billy. I could tell that by looking at you. It's that Vosnick with that mouth of his. Everybody knows he's got it in for Eddie Cook. But you know that Eddie Cook didn't shoot anybody. Don't you? I Take car my friends. With me it is principle. You are getting married and all that stuff. You know what I mean? You will be needing some junk for around the house. I got a lot of good connections. Real good discounts, Billy-boy. What do you say? Way below wholesale? Fossy and me just been saying what happens when somebody crosses Al. He has got such a nice way of turning a guy into dog meat. Some years ago we put Cook away on a coercion rap. Then the letters came by the dozen. Saying it was a mistake. Demanding his release. One from a .. Congressman. Another from a Colonel in the War Department. Who pulled the strings? - Somebody. Fortunately, the mayor got wind of it and Cook served out his sentence. The point is the same, huh? He's got influence. How about Dahlke? How come he can be such a big-shot in an important union? How come the men elect him? - Let's do something about it. Fine. Fine. Just what is it you can prove against him? Bill. There is a lot goes on that we know is wrong. But to know and to prove aren't one and the same. There is enough work around here for an army. For the sake of efficiency .. You learn not to eat holes in your stomach about things you can't move. What about Captain Wallace? Rose, please call the boss's office and see if that dinner meeting is still on. I got to let my wife know. It is my daughter's birthday. We're having a little party tonight. I asked you about Sid Wallace. He was a long-time cop. One of the best-liked men on the force. Look at his record. More than his share of big-time arrests. - He is a friend of Dahlke's. After you've been around a while you'll have your share of unsavory friends. What did he do wrong? He only brought you two together. He didn't tell you what to do and he won't. It looks to me like he is taking Cook's part. Is he? Well, let me remind you of something. As of his minute you haven't proven that Cook did a thing. Howard, those people on the docks have no faith in us. They think we are either frightened or bought. Without their cooperation we go no place. If we could bring in a conviction. I bet the gates would open. Alright. Bring it in. Alright, I will. - Bill. Go slow. Be careful. You have no idea what could work against you. I think I am beginning to find out. You haven't found out a thing yet. Just bear in mind everybody is working angles. Mr Keating, I have been waiting for you. I am no longer with the complaint department, Mrs Cavanagh. I've been moved to Homicide. But Mr Keating, the death rays? They are getting worse. Every time I go walking now, the enemy beams those rays on me. I can't even take little Mittens out for a stroll. Mrs Cavanagh, when I handed your problem gave it a great deal of thought. I decided .. Did you talk it over with the District Attorney? Yes. We both felt the best thing is for you to reconsider visiting your doctor. Mr Keating this is not a matter for medical science. He may be able to give you something to counteract the impulse from the rays. And that will give us time to track down the enemy's installation. Why didn't I think of that? You will go to see him right away? - Oh yes. And do kiss the District Attorney for me. Tony. Hi Bill. - Is she upstairs in his room? Yes. She is still up there. Why didn't you tell me Solly gunned Toby Zirk? I guess it slipped my mind. - Was Solly the gunman himself? Zirk is a friend of Cook. Cockeye wanted him on Solly's pier as boss checker. If you've got that, thieving comes easy. Solly said no and Zirk threw a slug into Solly's leg. Madge dug that slug out with a kitchen knife and wet the hole down with iodine. That was when Solly went out after Zirk and creased his skull. Toby has been a pretty good boy ever since. Here she is now. Mrs Pitts, how is it? You alright? - Yeah. Would you care for a ride home? No thanks. I can use the fresh air. Mrs Pitts, we need some help. There is no case unless Solly admits Cook shot him. We'd like you to talk to him for us. I'm sorry Mr Keating but Solly has his reasons. Good or bad. I won't go against him now. Mrs Pitts. Time is a very important factor. If Solly should die without changing his statement Cook goes free for good. Give me my dog. He's a tiger. There is nothing I can do. - Mrs Pitts. We know three men shot Solly. Cook is on the inside. But the other two are still on the loose. That's the wrong way to get me on your side, Mr Keating. I'm not afraid of those creeps. Let's try Benjy Karp. It's no use. He won't talk to you or anybody. Solly then? Let's ask the doctor. What, at this time of night? Why don't you go home instead and get yourself some rest? Tony, am I missing something? You want to work alone? Is that it? Bill, you have to live with these people before you know how to talk to them. See you in the morning, huh. Come on, Toots. That's it. Sorry, lady. Look, I can't hold Eddie Cook past noon today. Okay. You Monk Mohler? - That's right. I am Bill Keating. You wanted to see me? Yes, sir. I got information that will help you get Cockeye Cook. What is it? - This ain't no bum-steer. That Solly Pitts. All the time he has been square. Sit down, Monk. Will you ask Mr Rysdale to come over please. "Yes, sir." Let's have it, Monk. Him? I didn't expect nobody else. Well, we are all parts of the same family, Monk. How about it? Look, I haven't got all day. You'd better take him back to his cell. Wait a minute. You don't have to get sore, do you. It goes like this. Last night the cops pulled me in. I got sort-of boozed up and .. Got into a little scrimmage. I should have stood sober. So the police pulled you in. Go on. So, who do I meet in The Tombs? Cockeye. Eddie Cook. I know him from way back. So we start shooting the breeze. You know, making with the old talkie talk: 'Get a load of that chucklehead'. 'Look at the walk on that creep over there'. Not the kind of talk you get in a social setting. Hey, Monk. Stick to the point. Well later I say: 'What are you in for'? He says 'some meatball rap'. 'They say I shot Solly Pitts'. I say, no kidding. Only I didn't say no kidding. I used some kind of profanity. Monk. - Yes, sir? Then the talk gets confidential. He says to me, 'Monk'. 'You do me a favor and I will give you financial resources'. 'To fight your case'. I said what's with this 'financial resources'? He said: 'That's money, you dope'. He is going to give me a lot of it. All I got to do .. Is stand up in court and swear that he was home when Solly Pitts got it. Are you willing to swear to this in court? Yes, sir. Hey, you are ganging up on me. - That's alright. This is Mr Rysdale. Monk and I have met before. - Yeah, that's a fact. Monk says Eddie Cook tried to buy him as a witness. Oh? Is that the truth, Monk? So help me. So you are here for no other purpose but to tell the truth? No, sir. Well, it's all on account of Father Paul. You see, he is trying to keep me out of trouble. Last night I let him down. I got boozed up and .. Done him wrong. I am ashamed. What I am trying to say is that .. I have done a wrong to the best man that there is and .. And .. now to undo that wrong. I want to tell the truth. - Well, that's fine. How about it, Howard? Can I book Eddie Cook on attempted murder? Plenty of time for that. Monk, what are you in for? Like I told the counsellor, I was in a little scrimmage. What time? Well, last night the park, I .. Seen this sailor and his girl and they were .. Well after they .. I stuck up the sailor. I see. You been in trouble before? Well, you know .. - Answer me. Alright. So I got a record from here to Kenosha and back. At 13 you stole a horse and wagon with laundry in it. Yes, sir. You broke the window at Radbury's and stole four lengths of salami. Yes, sir. At 16 you broke into the chewing-gum machines on the subway. No, sir. I never did. No chewing-gum machines. You got me mixed up with my brother. - Now Monk .. No, sir. No chewing gum machines. I never busted one of them. Alright, alright, alright. At age 21 what was your principle occupation? You went over to parked cars where couples were necking and did what? Took a good look, natch. Then, after .. I stuck up the guy. But I didn't use no real gun. I know better than that. - And you did that hundreds of times? Not hundreds and no gum machines either. - Dozens? And most times you got away with it? - Yeah. I was lucky. You were lucky. What do you expect to get when you're convicted of this latest charge? Twenty years, with your record. What do you expect to get for testifying against Eddie Cook? Nothing. It's all for the sake of truth? - And Father Paul. That's all? So of course there is no thought in your mind to get leniency in your own case? No, sir. But I can always hope. But listen. Eddie Cook told me that, so help me. Don't you understand? I'm rotten. Can't you see? I'm rotten. Just to make up for the wrong I done. The only guy who tried to help me. It doesn't matter, Monk. It doesn't matter one way or the other. Just ask yourself. How credible a witness would you make? Credible? What is this 'credible'? Lousy, huh. Get him out of here. For that you dragged me out of a meeting upstairs, huh? You should have fished out the background on Mohler yourself. Well, what are you going to do about Cook now? I don't know. We still have a couple of hours. [ Telephone ] Criminal Courts Building. Third floor. Mr Keating. Keating. Mr Keating. Madge Pitts. I just talked to Solly. I think he is ready to give you what you want. The only thing is you'd better hurry. I'll be right there. Mr Keating, how can I go to the doctor? How am I supposed to walk the streets at all with those death rays all over me? You have got to do something now. Mike. There you are, Mrs Cavanagh. Now you are perfectly safe. You are grounded. Excuse me. Are you set, Stu? Right. You'll take it easy with him, Keating? He is hanging by a thread. I'll do my best. Comfort him. Tell him he is not going to die. What's the difference? Mrs Pitts, I have to be frank with you. I can't go in there and give him hope. None at all. A dying declaration according to law is only admissible as evidence .. If the victim believes he is going to die. I am sorry. Maybe you had better stay outside. Father Paul. Let's do it. Mr Pitts. I want to ask you what happened at your home the day before yesterday at 7:30am. How do you feel? Lousy. Do you think you are going to live? - The way I feel now, I don't know. What do you think your chances are? 60/40. I couldn't eat nothing. I just had a little water. So they tell me. Do you think you are going to die? The way I feel now? Yes. Have you given up all hope of recovery? I don't think I got a chance. Are you a catholic? - I am. Have you seen a priest? - Father Paul. You had the last rights of the church? - Yes. Are you telling me now that you have given up all hope of recovery? Yeah. I feel lousy. Solly. Who shot you? I don't feel so good. Solly, who shot you? Later. You come back tomorrow, huh? Maybe I'll tell you then. Solly, this isn't easy. You may not be around tomorrow. That's a fact. It was Eddie Cook. Who else? Tilly Moore and Leo Shaker. Could you repeat those last two names please. Tilly Moore and Leo Shaker. Why did they shoot you, Solly? I'd been trying to talk the guys into a wildcat against Dahlke. If he can't keep his men working on his orders he's through. Thanks, Solly. Rest a minute. Hello, Solly. How do you feel? State your full name. Edward Francis Cook. - Address? 505 Century Road, Long Island City. Solly, can you see this man? Yeah. Take your glasses off. Take 'em off. Solly, look at this man who calls himself Edward Francis Cook. Do you recognise him? Yeah. He's one of the men who shot me. Solly, what are you saying? - You know what I am saying. Look, Solly. You got to tell the truth here. This is important. I was home Tuesday morning. - So was I. You and I never had no differences. - Not much. Solly, tell the truth please. They are taking it down. Doctor, I don't think he is rational. - Oh no? Then tell the truth. You know who I am. Yeah, I know you. You and Tilly and Leo Shaker. You shot me. Alright. That is enough. Wait a minute. Let me talk to the man. Solly, you don't understand what you are doing. Don't I? Look here. This is what you've done you cockeyed scum! Why, you .. Get your hands off me, copper. Get him out of here. - Solly. You're out of your mind. I tell you, he's out of his mind. All I wanted to do was to do right by Madge. And the guys. I want her to make a living. Square. Now I am going to die a rat. To all my friends on the waterfront. They are not your friends, Solly. We are all through, Mrs Pitts. It will be put to good use. I promise you. I am looking for Benjy Karp. Benjy? He left about an hour ago. Did you try his house? Not there. - Hospital? No. He's got a new girl over in Jersey. That's where he is. Yeah. Over in Jersey. I wonder if you have read the papers. The Grand Jury indicted Eddie Cook. You know you can tell Benjy something from me. Tell him we are doing our part. Now how about him doing his? I got to go or I will miss my appointment. Alright. You watch yourself. You hear? - Yeah. Benjy. Hey, Benjy. Hey, fellow. Look, I am in a hurry. Great. We'll settle up real quick. Here, take a smoke. - No thanks. Go ahead. It's a buck a throw. Too rich for my blood. I'm liable to find I like them. Hey, that's okay. I had that feeling you're a little wet at the back of the ears. But that ain't your fault. Now listen, pal. I'm going to give it to you straight from the shoulder. No bull. I ain't got nothing against you. Nothing. We're both couple of working guys trying to make out. Only we come up with a conflict of interest. Yeah. Just a little. Now look, I know you're from some jerkwater place in PA. Okay. You came to the big city to make yourself a name. That is real okay. You got a right. Only you ain't going to do it by putting the arm on my friends. You get what I am going for? - I get it. Now look. I got to explain to you something. You see, half the guys who are working here on the docks. They got records. So what do they understand? Muscle. So every once in a while I got to make a fist. But don't forget that I take these guys on when nobody else wants them. I mean nobody. Where else will they get a job? Up in some cushy office in Rockefeller Center? Bull. Alright. You are a friend in need. What are you building? I am building this. I got a good thing going here. And I took a lot of busting around to put it all together. My blood is smeared all over this river front. And I'm going to let someone like you take it apart? So? So. Back up will you and make a good show. That's okay. Give yourself a lift up. I'll even give you a hand. Only don't go carrying that ball over for no touchdown. Or? I'll make you kind jerk of the whole world. You'll smell so bad even the flies won't bother. When I finish up with you .. Your head will feel like somebody has been stomping on it with spiked shoes. Well? What do you say, kid? Huh? You can read my answer off the walls of certain public places. Reggie, Reggie. What's happening? Do you remember a year ago when your wife needed an operation real quick? Sure, but .. You went to Solly for fifty and he came through. I paid for that. I wouldn't welsh. So how come I saw you coming out of Solly's place right after he was shot? No. Honest, Benjy. Benjy .. no. No! Mr Keating. Hi, Madge. What are you doing here? Mr Rysdale asked me to come in. I've been waiting 20 minutes. Do you know what he wants? - No. He sent for me too. How is Solly today? - Holding on. I don't know how he does it. If The Lord wants him he is going to have to come down and take him. Mr Keating. A man has been following me. All this week. Everywhere I went. He's not a cop, is he? Not as far as I know. I didn't think so. I'll ask Tony Vosnick about it. It's not that I'm scared. Don't get me wrong. It is a war of nerves. I know how these creeps work. Only sometimes when I'm home by myself. - Excuse me, Mr Keating. Mr Rysdale is waiting for you. He wants to see you alone. What about me? - It won't be long, Madge. Excuse me. Bill. This John Jacob Masters - Bill Keating. Jake is representing Cook. I was just telling Howard things haven't changed much around here. The same lumps in the same chair. I've been requisitioning a new one ever since you left. The only way to get it is to steal it. Hello Bill Keating. - How do you do, sir. Jake had my job before me. Broke me in. Had me bent in two before he was satisfied. Take your lessons and your lumps. The training you get around here can't be bought. I'll remember the advice. Jake doesn't seem to think we've got much of a case. The Grand Jury thought otherwise. Well, there's quite some difference between a grand jury and trial jury. Then we'll just have to convince the trial jury too. That may be more difficult that you suppose. Not when we present the facts. Yes. The facts. Naturally, I examined them before taking the case. I came to the conclusion that my client has a powerful ally in this situation. Reasonable doubt. Howard, when this is over why don't you bring Lois and the boys out to my place? I just bought a new boat. Goodbye, Mr Keating. - Bye. So long, Jake. - So long. Doesn't he want to see Mrs Pitts? - She can wait a moment longer. She'll have plenty of waiting from here on in. She may as well get used to it. Now, how about a witness who can place Cook at the scene? Our Lieutenant Vosnick said several people saw Cook and one of the others. There was a high-school student leaving an apartment house. And a woman on the roof across the way. - Where are the statements? The boy's parents won't let him testify. And the others? - They're afraid. They talked to Vosnick off the record of course, but that's as far as they'll go. I'm not interested in Vosnick's off-the-record conversations. That's not evidence. Well, at least it shows that we are right. Howard, I'm not saying it's open and shut but we are not in bad shape. We got Solly Pitts' last statement. Masters has got Solly's first one clearing Cook. Well, I'm sure I can convince a jury that Solly's first denial was false. Well, that's fine. But I am not so sure that I can and you won't be prosecuting. I will. Howard, what do you want? I'd feel a lot better if we had just one reliable witness .. Who can place them at the scene. Okay. Benjy Karp. Give me some time and I will bring him around. In the meantime, why underestimate what we have got? Madge's testimony alone will go a long way to back up Solly's last statement. Will it? Alright, you show me how good a witness you got out there. Rose, send in Mrs Pitts. "Sorry, Mr Rysdale. She went home." "She said if you wanted to talk to her you can see her there." Look, I can't spend my life sitting around some office. I apologise Mrs Pitts. It was unavoidable. Yeah, yeah. Madge, I would like Mr Rysdale to hear what you did after the shots. What do you want from me? I've been over it ten times. Once more if you don't mind. - Well, I do. What do you think I'm made of? Madge, you're to be our most important witness. I wouldn't ask you to do this if it wasn't necessary. I was in the shower. I heard the shots, I pulled on my robe and I ran downstairs. Solly was .. Well, he was lying on the steps. He tried to get up and couldn't. Did he say anything? He said: 'Cockeye. Cockeye did it'. 'Cockeye Cook and two of his meatballs'. Something like that. Something like that? Exactly that. - But you said 'something' like that. Well, I don't know why I said 'something' like that. Exactly that. 'Cockeye did it. Cockeye and his meatballs'? Yes. - Positive? I am. So he didn't say 'Cockeye Cook'. He just said 'Cockeye'. He said 'Cockeye Cook'. - But you just said .. I don't care what I said. He said 'Cockeye Cook'. I got a lot of work to do. Come on, get out of here. Madge. This is an extremely important point. Cockeye is not an entirely uncommon nickname. It can refer to anyone. But 'Cockeye Cook' couldn't and that's what Solly said. Now look you, don't go and mix me up. Madge, when you came down the staircase and saw your husband, was he bleeding? What kind of a question is that? With 6 slugs in him? And was he noticeably in pain? With garlic on the slugs? So he was in pain, bleeding profusely on the staircase. The man you love. Your husband. Now, you couldn't be expected to come on to a scene like that .. And not get excited or even hysterical. So is it possible you didn't have your wits about you and don't really know .. Whether your husband said 'Cockeye Cook' or simply 'Cockeye'? Whose side are you on? - Answer me! Alright. I was excited. I was shaking like a leaf. I could hardly keep my breakfast down. But he said 'Cook'. I heard him clear and nothing is going to change that. I'm sorry, Madge. But the defense attorney will quite possibly put you through that and more. Thank you, Mrs Pitts. Mr Keating. I know you want the same thing I do. To nail those bums good. I'll give you all the help I can. But if you try that again, so help me I am going to bust you right on the nose. Okay. Sometimes those coal mines in Wilks-Barre don't look so bad at all. [ Telephone ] Hello? - "Mrs Pitts?" Yes. "This is a good friend of yours, Madge." "I've got some advice and I hope you take it in the right spirit." Who is this? "You don't want to testify at no trial." "Solly is about done for, so what's the use?" "Why not take a nice vacation, huh?" "For your own health. Get the idea?" "Mexico would be just the place." "So we're going to send you some cash in the mail." You go to hell! And here is one from Wilks-Barre. 'Congratulations and best wishes for a long life and happiness'. 'Cousin Edith and family'. Some family. Six kids. All girls. This one is from Newhaven. 'Best wishes, best wishes, best wishes'. 'The sore losers club. Tom Dick and Harrison'. Oh. And this one is to me. 'Our heartfelt sympathy over ..'. Honey, this is nothing. - Bill. Don't pay any attention to it. Here. Sweetness. Honey. What is it? Who is there? I'm not afraid of you. Any of you! You dirty, lousy no-good rats! [ Telephone ] Madge. I am sorry. Solly passed away early this morning. He asked to see you. We called the house, but .. There was no answer. Oh God. No. I will stay with her until vespers. Thank you, Father. May the Lord have mercy on his soul. May we pay our respects, Father? It was Tilly Moore I saw coming out of Solly's place. Tilly. The rat. Alright, Benjy. So the case then has around three main points. Solly's dying declaration. The last one of course. Madge's testimony of what Solly said after he was shot. Benjy Karp's testimony that he saw Moore running from the scene. That is all? - Except for a few minor points. Alright. Have we got a case here that we can win? The voting is that we go to trial. Fred? No. Bill? Yes. Al? Yes. Vic? - No. Zig? Yes. Norm? - No. My vote is .. No. We refer the case back to Mr Keating for further investigation. You're next, Norm. - Well. We got to take this .. Howard, I think you're making a mistake. I don't want to go to trial with this evidence. It can't win for us. You told me you wanted someone to place those men at the scene. Well, I got you Benjy Karp. - But he can only place Moore there. What are we supposed to do about Cook and Shaker? Put in more time. Maybe you can bring in one of those other witnesses that Vosnick mentioned. I have no objection to the time. But if we don't push this now we'll lose Madge Pitts and Benjy Karp. As it is they only half believe we are going into bat. Bill. Look at this objectively. Our most important evidence is the statement of a dead man .. To which he himself supplied the contradiction. Only two decent witnesses. The wife. The other a long-time friend with a history of animosity toward Cook. Only one of the three men indicted can we place at the scene. Now. Doesn't that say to you 'reasonable doubt'? I admit we could be stronger but what case couldn't? Howard, this is the first time a man on the docks has named his killers. He gave us something we've been hollering for so let's use it. These people need help. They can't be expected to fight those thugs alone. I fail to see how a weak case can help them at all. Well, let the jury decide if it's weak. That's what it's for. I don't want those three men to walk out of the courtroom acquitted. Unfortunately, it's not what actually happened that is important. It is what a jury believes happened. That is what counts. Well Norm, let's continue with the meeting. I think we ought to take in to the boss. Well, that is not the way things are done around here, Bill. The Bureau makes its own decisions on matters of this nature. But it seems we are at an impasse. There is no impasse. You heard the voting. Four to three against. You told me once Cook has a lot of influence. Now I wonder just how deep it cuts. Howard. Rose. Call upstairs and arrange for Mr Keating and myself to see him. The sooner the better. Gentlemen, we will continue later. Well the boss raked me good. He cut me down to zero. By the time he was finished I was looking for a rock to crawl under. He said he had a smooth-running office and intended to keep it that way. He said the only way to get things done .. Was for each of us to have regard for the other. Everyone makes mistakes, honey. A rash remark, that's all it was. I never realized I had such a big mouth. I left Howard with him and took off. I felt so lousy I didn't even give him my side. I don't know. Maybe I don't understand the office. I wonder if I ought to leave. Rogers & Morden may still want me. What is wrong with corporation law? I think it is fine. You'll have a lot more time for yourself. The money is better. We wouldn't have to chase around so much. And listen to the suffering of a lot of helpless people. [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] Howard. May I come in? Sure. Hello Dee. Hello Howard. How are you? - Fine. I just finished with the boss. After you left we reviewed the whole case. I gave him my arguments and seeing as you weren't there .. I gave him yours too. He agrees with you. He said to get the case in the calendar as soon as possible. Oh, Howard. Can I get you a drink or something? No, no. No thanks. Rose is going to kill me. I was supposed to be home early to go Christmas shopping. This happened to me. We should start a club. Howard, if you still feel we have a weak case .. How well can you prosecute? This husband of yours has a penchant for insulting me. I guess I am just trying to be tough like you. Bill. I told the boss since it's your baby you should handle the trial. And he said 'okay'. But. I will be there to help. Goodnight. - Goodnight. As the final declaration of the deceased has now been introduced into evidence. I wish to call your attention to him specifically naming the defendants .. As the men who shot him. We now call the next witness. Before calling the next witness, Your Honor. Since, in the interest of justice the first declaration of the deceased .. Has also been introduced into evidence. I call particular attention to a question asked by Mr Keating. In that declaration: 'Who shot you'? And the explicit reply of the deceased: 'I don't know'. We now call Mr Benjamin Karp. Mr Benjamin Karp please. Now, Mr Karp. Will you please tell us who you saw coming out of the deceased's .. Apartment building about 7:30 on the morning of the shooting. That guy over there. Tilly Moore. Thank you. Your witness. Mr Karp, do you recall when you first told Mr Keating .. You saw Mr Moore coming out of the apartment building? Sure. I remember. The day Solly Pitts died, wasn't it? - That's right. But sir, your friend was shot 21 days before he died. Were you not asked in that period if you had seen anyone leave the building? Yeah. I was asked. By Mr Keating? - Yes. By Lieutenant Vosnick and other police officers? Yes. All in all, how many times were you asked? Fifty? Maybe. And each and every time how did you reply? I said .. I saw nobody. So approximately fifty times. Under diligent and careful questioning by qualified investigators .. You said you saw nobody. Now you say you saw somebody. Obviously sir, there is a falsehood here someplace. Isn't there? That will be all, Mr Karp. Witness excused. We call Mrs Madge Pitts. Mrs Madge Pitts. Mr Keating, is there some difficulty? Your Honor. We respectfully request adjournment until tomorrow. Mrs Pitts. Wife of the deceased and principal witness on behalf of the people .. Apparently has .. disappeared. Mr Keating, this trial has been in effect four days. It's your duty to see to it the witness is available. I'm sorry, Your Honor. I advised Mrs Pitts that Lieutenant Vosnick would pick her up this morning. When he arrived at her apartment she wasn't there. Subsequent efforts have failed to locate her. We ask adjournment for further time to find her. Apparently, there is no alternative. You will keep me informed. Court adjourned until 10:30 tomorrow morning. Benjy, I would like to talk to you. Madge has been gone three days. Yeah? The whole force is looking for her. - Yeah. I know. There is a theory that Dahlke grabbed her. How do you feel about it? - I got to go. Just what I thought. Where is she, Benjy? How should I know? Look, I am busy now. Benjy, there is no case without her. I've had three postponements and I am not sure I can get a fourth. You ought to know that dismissal means acquittal for Cook. We can't try him again on the same charge. Look, lay off, will you. Benjy. They are shutting down the pier. Why, that is a wildcat. It's illegal. So is killing Solly. Look, Benjy. - Boom. No matter what you say. Boom. Look we are fed up to the teeth. I'd rather be dead than kneeling down to Dahlke. But nobody likes a wildcat, Benjy. How are you going to keep news like that from the jury? What else can it to but hurt? - Look. We are hurt already. We're bleeding. I saw that Tilly Moore come out of Solly's place with my own two eyes. And that lawyer makes me out a crummy liar. Okay, we lost a point. That's not the whole ballgame. That court is not going to help us. We'll handle it in our own way. Look, Benjy. You can strike any time you want. Who can stop you? I am asking you to hold off. We still got Tony Vosnick and Madge to testify. And as of right now we got Cook and his thugs up for murder .. And we can take them all the way to the chair. Let's do it legal, huh? Then if it doesn't work, do it your way. You need Madge, yeah? You might try her cousin's place in Brooklyn. Come on. Anybody home? Anybody here? I am looking for Madge Pitts. Nobody here by that name. Benjy Karp said there was. Who? - Benjy Karp. He said she was here. Oh. That door there to your left. Thanks. Who is it? Bill Keating. Come in. We've been looking all over for you. I was just going to call you. Just? We thought something happened. Something did. Solly died. Yeah. And you said you were going to testify. I got upset. My nerves were snapping like rubber bands. I just had to get away. You could have waited until after the trial. I could have. I didn't. What's the difference? The difference is you damage the case. I am sorry. It couldn't be helped. No? Look. You have found me and I am going back with you. Okay? - Why did you leave? That's my business. It is my business too. You are my witness. Look, Madge. I was told that everyone in this thing has an angle. Have you got one? Why did you leave? Alright. You want to know? It is the season. Peace on earth. Goodwill to men. Did you ever hear of a jury handing out a death sentence just before Christmas? You have stated that when you found your husband .. Slumped approximately here in the stairway .. You said to him: 'Solly, Solly'. Alright. Now, please tell the court exactly what your husband then said to you in reply. He said: 'Cockeye did it'. 'Cockeye Cook and two of his meatballs'. Thank you. Yours. Mrs Pitts, I trust you are feeling well enough for this examination? We know the ordeal you've been through. Don't worry about me. Just worry about them. Mrs Pitts, do you recall that a patrolman arrived at the scene .. Just a few moments after the shooting? Yes. Did you tell him what you have just told us your husband said? No. Then you rode to the hospital with your husband .. And there were met by Police Captain Connors and another officer. Is that correct? - Yes. Did you tell them? No. An hour or so later Mr Keating and Lieutenant Vosnick arrived. Did you tell them at that time? Yes. Lady, I believe you misunderstood my question. Immediately upon their arrival did you tell them? No. What happened was this, wasn't it? You and Lieutenant Vosnick went aside .. And conversed out of earshot of the others. Right? - That's right. I just want to be accurate. Then, after your private conversation with the Lieutenant .. You decided to tell Mr Keating your story. Alright. I don't remember exactly how it happened. I wouldn't lie about anything Solly said. What kind of a person would I be if I lied .. Mrs Pitts, I must caution you to be only responsive. That is quite alright, Your Honor. Mrs Pitts has put an interesting question. Perhaps we should endeavour to find out just what kind of a person she is. We offer in evidence a complaint filed in Recorders Court Hoboken New Jersey. Charging Mrs Pitts of uttering loud and indecent language. Objection. It is being collateral. I will allow t. - Thank you. And is not true that you were fined for using boisterous language? 3 or 4 men were arguing. It was a Sunday. Did you ever hear of the Little Paradise Club in Hoboken? Yes. - What is it? It's a sort-of bar. - You worked there? Yes. - In what capacity? I was a waitress. - A waitress? Or was it rather that you made a living getting commissions .. When the male customers bought drinks? - That's right. And the more drinks they bought the more commission you got. Now wait a minute. That was a long time ago. Things were tough for me then. Thank you, lady. You have eloquently told us just what kind of a person you are. Your Honor, I have finished with the witness. Let's blow. - Come on. Wait. Wait a minute. The defense calls Mr William Keating. Mr William Keating please. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? In the case now pending before this court, so help you God? I do. - Take the stand. You are relatively new to the Homicide Bureau of the DA's office? I am. Naturally, it would be some feather in your cap to win a case such as this. Objection. - Sustained. Weren't you surprised that someone as inexperienced as yourself .. Was assigned to try this case? I suppose. Wouldn't it be logical to assume that your chief Mr Rysdale would try it? Yes. - Why didn't he? You will have to ask him. Is it not a fact that Mr Rysdale, a man of vast experience .. Did not consider the evidence strong enough for a conviction? He does now. - Now? I'm talking about before. No, he did not. - You argued the matter? Yes. - Heatedly? I suppose I said some things I didn't mean. Oh. Then you are an impetuous young man given to rash behaviour? Objection. Sustained. Counsel will confine himself to the facts of the case. When Mr Cook was first brought in. On what did you hold him? I held him as a material witness. Is that the usual way to hold a murder suspect? No. Why didn't you hold Mr Cook on a short affidavit? There wasn't enough evidence at the time. Enough? Or any? No, Mr Keating. There wasn't any evidence. So you held Mr Cook as a material witness. Is that legal? It is standard procedure. Done every day. That is not what I asked. Is it legal? Technically speaking, no. Now. The deceased's first statement. The one in which he said Mr Cook did not shoot him. That was given you when? On the day of the shooting. And the contradictory statement? - Two days later. In that two-day period .. You tried to get Mr Pitts to change his first statement that cleared Mr Cook? I did. - To what avail? None. - But two days later. Suddenly and abruptly he changed his original statement. And named the defendants. - That's right. Didn't it strike you as strange that he said one thing to you for two days .. And then suddenly and abruptly said the opposite? No. Did it strike you as strange that Benjy Karp for days on end said he saw no-one? And then suddenly and abruptly said he saw someone? No. Didn't it strike you as strange that Mrs Pitts .. Said nothing for at least two hours after the shooting .. And then accused Mr Cook? In this case, no. - No? Well, sir. I consider it strange. And I warrant others do too. Weren't you even curious as to the reason .. For all of those sudden and abrupt changes? I knew the reason. They decided finally to tell the truth. No, sir. That was not the reason. And in short order I will show just what the reason was. Your Honor, I ask that the witness be excused briefly. I would like to call back a witness who testified earlier. With Mr Keating's kind permission. He has me here. Why doesn't he finish? The defense may conduct the examination as it wishes .. Provided no rules of procedure are breached. I call Lieutenant Anthony Vosnick. Lieutenant Anthony Vosnick please. You are aware that your earlier oath still holds. I am. You were a very close friend of the deceased? I was. He had confidence in you. - Yes. And you've been a friend of Benjy Karp for how long? Fifteen years. Are you a friend of Mr Cook or any of the defendants? No. In fact, you are their avowed enemy. - I'm a cop. They are racket men. And as racket men, in your eyes they deserve punishment. Anyone who commits a crime deserves punishment. Quite true. By the way. During the investigation did you talk to Solly Pitts alone? I did. Did you talk to Madge Pitts alone? - I did. Benjy Karp too? - Yes. Of course, you have written records of those talks? No. No written records at all? None at all. Lieutenant, you had many cases, many witnesses. You have written records of those cases? Yes. In this case however, from beginning to end you have put nothing in writing. That's what I said. Other than what you say now we've no way to know what you said to those people? That's right, but you can find .. - Lieutenant. Do you believe Mr Cook is innocent of killing Mr Pitts? Yeah. He is innocent. The same as he is in all those other killings. Other killings? You mean to say Mr Cook has been convicted of other killings? I didn't mean that. Has he ever been convicted of any killing? No. Is not a man innocent until proven guilty? That's what they say. Yes. That's what they say. Therefore, is not Mr Cook innocent of those killings you mentioned? I know what I know. And of course, a racket man must be punished for his crimes. I re-call Mr William Keating. When the decision was first made to hold Mr Cook as a material witness .. Did you discuss it with Lieutenant Vosnick? Yes, but I did want .. - Don't volunteer, sir. You know the rules. Now, who was the last person Mrs Pitts spoke to .. Before she accused Mr Cook of shooting her husband? Lieutenant Vosnick. Now just answer the question. Who was the officer by himself and alone had several talks with Benjy Karp .. Before that man named Tilly Moore? Lieutenant Vosnick. And who by himself and alone paid a midnight visit to Solly's hospital? The very night before he hastily changed his statement and named the defendants? Objection. This is calling for conclusions. Read the name off the hospital records. Lieutenant Vosnick. In other words it was Lieutenant Vosnick, wasn't it? That self-styled avenger. The detective with no records who staged this entire thing. It was he, who under bonds of friendship talked Solly into naming Mr Cook. And planned this whole detestable scheme to frame innocent men. Objection. - And it was you. An inexperienced ambitious young man who became his captive and his dupe. No more questions. Come on. Let's get out of here. The defense rests, Your Honor. The court adjourns until 2pm. Bill. Later, honey. What about it, Tony? - Nothing. Come on, Tony. My paper always treats you right. Give us a statement? Wally, some other time. - Tony. At least you should know enough to keep records. They were 'off the record' meetings. I didn't feel .. You just didn't think. Well, Howard? Let's go with your closing argument. Ladies and gentlemen. 'Reasonable doubt' is no empty phrase. The law requires, in fact insists, that these men be set free. If reasonable doubt exists. And since we have shown conclusively the existence of reasonable doubt. You can return but one verdict. Not guilty. Thank you. Keating, are you ready with your closing argument? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury I must commend counsel for the defense. He has done a remarkable job. He made it seem as if the defendants in this case are not those 3 men at all. But Lieutenant Vosnick and myself. He has done so good a job. We are all in danger of forgetting that Solly Pitts did name his killers. That Madge Pitts did hear him name Cook. And that Benjy Karp did see Tilly Moore running from the scene. It is now my duty to sum up the fact of this case on behalf of the people. I will be as brief as I possibly can. First, you must consider the magnificent courage of Madge and Benjy .. In defying threats and testifying. If your verdict is acquittal. What will they go back to face on the waterfront? That's something you can guess as well as I. It's not a pleasant contemplation. But the counsel for defense is less interested in that. Than in having you believe certain things about me. He has accused me of being ambitious. I am. He has accused me of being brash. That too is true. I have a big mouth and the way I said .. Objection. Mr Keating is not permitted to comment on his own testimony. I am not commenting. I am just stating what is in the record. There is nothing the record sir about you having a big mouth. My apologies. He's accused me of being inexperienced. That is in the record. In that .. counsel was most generous. Why, on occasion I am positively inept. Objection. Mr Keating. I am not going to allow these comments on your testimony. This is a peculiar situation. The skilful counsel has accused me and strangely by rules of procedure .. I am unable to defend. However. There is a question I must ask you. As I have been asking myself. How can my character .. Or Lieutenant's Vosnick's method of working .. Possibly affect the facts of the shooting? How can they change what happened in Solly's hallway the morning he was shot? The defendants did shoot and kill him. That fact is clear and irrevocable. And yet. Madge and Benjy's courage may go for nothing. Three guilty men may go free. Because of my ambition. My brashness, my inexperience. But is the waterfront to continue as a place where murder flourishes .. Unhampered by law? Is it to remain a sanctuary for murderers? The opportunity to change this rests with you. You may take that opportunity by .. Returning a verdict of guilty as charged. Thank you. Well? I haven't seen a jury sit all night like this since the Jerry McCall case. I hear Cook and the others have a table reserved at the Copa for New Year's Eve. What about it, Keating? Honey. Honey, why don't you go home? I can phone you. No. How about some coffee then? I can send out. Bill. Bill. Benjy and his guys shut down the pier with the morning shift. Dahlke? I hear he stormed out of here about an hour ago. You stay here. - No. I'll be in touch. - I'm going with you. Do what I ask. Tony. - Yes. Get the riot squad down there as soon as you can. Right. Dahlke is coming in. Okay. Okay boys. Okay. You had your fun. It took a lot of guts too. Real okay. Now, what do you say you open up the pier, huh? Alright. I'll forget all about it. It never happened. Bygone sis bygones. Who holds a grudge, huh? Not me. Only open up the pier, will you? Benjy boy. Talk to your pals, will you. Tell them some sense. Look. Boys. I'll make Benjy hiring boss in place of Solly. Pretty good? Alright. I'll do even better. Benjy. Do you want to be business agent and park your butt behind a desk? You got it. Who says I ain't reasonable? Only, open up the pier and there ain't going to be any trouble. We'll open the pier when you get out of the union. That's right. You guys down there, don't forget what I said. You guys down there move up. Get your signs and move around. Don't break. Come on, come on. Keep moving. You jerks. You stupid meatheads. Who do you think you are? You think you are going to bust up something that took years to build? Take your bums. And get them out of here. I'll give you one more chance. One chance. Open up that pier! You better get out of here. You're going to be bloody like the rest of them. Dear God, we ask your aid and guidance today. These men do not like violence but they must defend themselves. Grant that I am doing right. Come on. Let's go. Who asked you around here? Hey, you. I am talking to you. Keating. We tried to do it your way like you said. Now, we got to do it ours. Come on, keep this line going. What is your problem? - Go on, beat it. No-one can make them work if they don't want to. They got contracts. Signed. They work or else. Alright. Take it up in court. Who needs it? I got my own way. Come on, men. Bust 'em. I'll file a complaint against every man I can remember. From where? Back in a coal mine? That's where they are going to send you. Now get lost, crumb. Take your hands off of me. Sure. Who wants to get dirty touching dogmeat who takes his orders from a framing cop? Wait. Take it easy, will you. Hey Captain. You know me. I'm Al Dahlke. Yes, l know. Take him in. Wait a minute. Hey. Hey! Bill. It's alright. Let's go, Bill. I am sorry. Let's get back to the courthouse. [ Radio: ] "Here is a special news bulletin." "9:32 am."
