Our tale begins with Orllie-Antoine de Tounens, a Frenchman who disembarked on the coast of Chile in 1858. He traveled to the Wallmapu, autonomous lands of the Mapuche nation. According to legend, he reached the southern end of the continent. Orllie-Antoine planned to unite this vast region and all its peoples, that Chile and Argentina had tried for centuries to conquer, and create a kingdom. Time and neglect have eroded the memory of this man. I am king. I am the son of water. I am the night bird. I am the serpent that buries his head in the mud. I am the skin, without owner, without form. I am one hundred thousand flies that move as one. I am he with the golden face, the golden fingers, the golden feet. I am the king with hands of water. KING Chapter 1 THE CAPTIVITY The King of Araucania and Patagonia. Sit down, Your Majesty. - Leave us. - Yes, sir. The king, finally, in the flesh. Mr Orllie-Antoine de Tounens, a lawyer from... Pérignon? Périgord. From the country. Let's speak plainly. You're a French spy. Sent by your government to raise the Indians against us. We've been following you since you came here the first time, a year ago. Why have you come back? You're preparing a French invasion. Admit it. You may be silent now, but you will have to talk to the court. Your story is hard to believe since these are the most savage Indians of all the Americas. You claim to have entered their territory and that they chose you as their king? You? A simple country lawyer? Do you understand the importance of your claims? Do you? For raising the Araucanos against Chile, you risk execution. You may want to reconsider your ridiculous position. Sir, your meal. I flew across the sea with wings that I had hidden since I was a child. I followed a path of wind. Guided by dreams. I set foot on this coast for the first time and I felt its welcome. It beats beneath my feet. I had already died here. A new body awaits me beneath this earth. On the shores of the Bio Bio. Where your land begins. Dear subjects, I have arrived. Chapter 2 THE TRIAL Orllie-Antoine de Tounens. For these serious crimes, such as disturbing the peace and high treason against the State of Chile, we ask for your execution. Do you have anything to say in your defense? I crossed the Bio Bio River, the border separating Chile and the independent region of Araucania. I was not in Chilean territory. Mr Tounens, you are in a sad position, but we shouldn't be surprised that a foreigner is so confused by Chile's geography. After all, this is not your country. But let's not focus on this detail anymore. You say you crossed the Bio Bio. Tell us about it. Mr Tounens, please. You can't expect us to believe that you, a civilized Frenchman, went by yourself to such a hostile place. A land at war for the last 300 years. So, tell us, how did you manage to enter Araucania without being killed? The Araucano Indians are well known for their savagery. I went in peace. I wasn't traveling alone. I had contacted Chief Mañil by letter. I hired Mr Rosales to take me to him. And I was going to make a proposal to him and his tribe. We had entered Araucanian territory. The centuries of fighting you mention are proof of their independence. The tribes have never been conquered. Not by any army. Tell me. Why did you come? You, a lawyer from Paris. Why were you interested in traveling to this land? I'm not from Paris, Rosales. I'm from the countryside. From the countryside? A man from the country as well! How is the countryside in France? It's good. It's a different kind of beauty, more ordered. A country lawyer then! Have some. But my family has royal blood. We are princes. I see. So you live in a castle? No, not a castle. How would you call it? "La Chèze". It's a big house, a mansion. I understand. The stew will be ready soon. This is Lemunao's hut. They will take us to Mañil. Let's go. Quilapan doesn't like the Winka to come. Quilapan doesn't like to talk with them. Quilapan won't speak to you. You are Winkas. You are Winkas. Quilapan is a warrior. Is Quilapan hostile to Winkas? Mañil, and Quilapan are warriors, they don't like the Winka. Is he Mañil's son? Mañil is gone. He passed away. - Mañil is dead? - Yes. Mañil is dead. Bad news. Mañil is dead. He died recently. Now Quilapan, Mañil's son, is in charge. He's a great warrior. A military commander, very hostile. He is against the Winka, and you are a white man. I have Mañil's support. I wrote him. He invited me. If Quilapan is loyal to his father he will meet me. Quilapan will not receive you. Tell them, Rosales. You are a Winka. He spoke, so... that is why I speak. You can't speak Mapudungun. The situation is bad, brother. The Ngenechen, the Master of Nature, has punished us. Is that why the Master is mad? Because the Winka have come? We can't pray because they are here. That's why it has become dark. The Father above has become angry. That's why the Father above is mad. Because the Winkas are here. That's why. Is it our fault? That is why my heart is sad. "That is why my heart is sad", says my wife. "Why do you keep weaving?" my children ask. "You are sick." "Stop weaving", they tell me. But I just keep on weaving. It's true. What are they saying? They say it's dangerous for us to go on. That it's better for us to go back. He is lying to you. He can't speak even a bit of Mapudungun. No. We must go on. We shouldn't go there, it's dangerous. But if we want to go then it's a two day journey southeast by horse. Let's go then. - That's right, brother. - That's the way it is. If we are patient the sun will come out. I hope so, brother. Then we will be fine. Our whole family is going to make it through this. Our family is suffering. All of us and you and I. The whole family, we'll make it through this. Let's pray for our children and our animals. To the Father above and the Mother above. That's right. Say a good prayer... I'm worried, I have grandchildren. How are they? God help me, give me strength. May all be well with my children and grandchildren. Father, if we are at fault, have patience. Father, have patience. So, Rosales? The lake. What lake? We've lost the trail. We need to retrace our steps a bit, Mr Antoine. Back to the last stream we crossed. In the Coihue forest. This path has taken us too far east. We are going in circles. So, when do you think we will be at Quilapan's village? Two more days. Two more days? Serve the food. Thank you. Is this meat soup? In French we say "ragoût". What is it? I don't know, maybe it was the army. Why? To scare the Indians. No, it's something else. This is witchcraft. We'd better leave. Come on, let's go. Hello. Hello, madam. We are looking for Quilapan. Sister, these people from the other side of the sea say they are looking for Quilapan. Do you know this Winka? Why are you looking for Quilapan? I have come here with the very specific purpose of meeting Quilapan. I was invited by his father Mañil before he died. So... They are looking for Chief Quilapan. - He says his father... - This is bad. Please sit down. Thank you. Now have some. Drink it. No. There will not be a path so don't go that way. How is it that you speak Spanish? How is it that you speak Spanish? You're not from here. No, I am not from here. We are looking for Quilapan's village. Is it far? Yes. You come here accompanied by a big serpent and by a big fox. Do you see them? I don't understand. Now I give you this cloak. Please accept this. So you feel protected. It is magical. You will feel good. Thank you. Great Serpent. Great Fox. Great Serpent. Great Fox. Great Serpent. Great Fox. The traveller cannot pass through. Somebody asks why this bird has a different song. It's saying there's fog and you can fall off the cliff and die. Chapter 3 THE BETRAYAL Please state your full name. My name is Juan Bautista Rosales. Mr Rosales, What was the nature of your employment? I was the Frenchman's guide and translator. I was hired to take him to Chief Mañil. Chief Mañil. Yes, sir. Very well. How long did you travel with him? Two weeks. Very good. Please, Mr Rosales, continue. Let's start at the Bio Bio. Very good. There is a calm spot over there. We can cross with the horses. Let's get moving. No, wait! As you wish. The Frenchman was very mysterious. But I liked him. He was strange. I had travelled with Europeans before but Mr Antoine was different. He was stubborn. Headstrong! Good job, cowboy! I've never seen a flag with such colors. What country is it from? It's the flag of a kingdom. A kingdom? You mean an old kingdom? No. It's a new kingdom. Kingdoms still exist. In Europe? Yes. There are kingdoms everywhere. I've wanted to come here my whole life. Here in Chile? No. This is not Chile. Since we crossed the Bio Bio we have been in Araucania. Araucania, what we call "The Land", also belongs to Chile. And where are the Chileans? Who do you think you are? What are they up to? - I don't know. - We don't know them. I took the Frenchman to Lemunao and his family. They didn't seem to understand the purpose of Mr Antoine. We learned Mañil had died. We shouldn't go visit Mañil's family, because they are mourning. They're asking who you are. Mañil knows me. He wrote me a letter. Chief Mañil died recently. It's better if we go back. They're offering us food and we can stay here. But just for tonight since we have to go back. No, tell them we are going on. Where do they come from? He's traveling alone. And he doesn't bring anything. I don't know him. They just arrived here. That's how I see it. Maybe he's got his stuff there. Who knows what he might have. They didn't trust us. Lemunao had told us that Mañil's son, the warrior Quilapan, had taken his father's place. He said we shouldn't go, since he was very hostile. Mr Antoine insisted. He threatened to cut my pay if I asked questions. I told him: "Frenchman, I am your guide. "I don't want any problems." Tell us, Mr Rosales, do you recognize this map? It's the map the Frenchman drew. A territory he began calling his "kingdom". - His "kingdom"? - Yes. He drew it to show Quilapan and his allies where they should station their troops. Did you say troops? Yes, sir. Silence! Let's hear the witness. Mr Prosecutor, continue. Thank you, Your Honor. Tell us, Mr Rosales. What was the Frenchman's proposal? The Frenchman told him he was creating a kingdom. The Kingdom of Araucania. And what happened? A general assembly was called and many chiefs came. He gave a long speech about becoming their king. I remember everything clearly. He said: This land is yours, you have every right to defend it! Chile nor Argentina have anything to say. You must send word to the other tribes immediately. I thought this might be a joke. To the independence of Araucania! But when Mr Antoine began, promising them weapons and even warships, I knew he had to be stopped immediately, before he raised an army. Rosales! Let's go! Obeying my solemn duty and loyalty to our nation, I led him to a spot where he could be easily captured. Colonel Saavedra sent his men who arrested him without difficulty. The rest you already know, Mr Prosecutor. Thank you, Mr Rosales. I have no more questions, you can go. Chapter 4 THE FEVER I had been in Araucania before. I entered from the south the first time. From Valdivia. I was alone. That's how I met Mañil. We agreed to establish a kingdom. I drafted the constitution and went to Valparaiso to look for support. Chile ignored me. But I met two Frenchmen. We decided to return together and convince more chiefs. I never should have followed Rosales. If only I had gone back alone. Like the first time. None of this would have happened. I would be in my kingdom today. Together with my subjects. So, even though Rosales warned you, you decided to go and meet Quilapan. Did you ever reach Quilapan? Yes. We finally reached Quilapan. They were all there. Valiant warriors! Noble chiefs! I have come to you as a symbol of the future. A dove of peace. A loyal sovereign. A guide dedicated to your destiny. We will proceed to draw up a constitution. To establish the foundation of our kingdom, Each and every one of you will be a minister. Minister of Agriculture. Minister of Defense. Minister of Education. There was no talk of violence, ever. I made them a proposal. And they elected me their king. I am very grateful to the two Frenchmen who were at Quilapan's. Lachaise and Desfontaines are two great merchants who know all the tribes well. They know the language very well and proved to be excellent translators. They translated my proposal to the assembly and were very helpful. Thank you Mr Tounens. What a lovely fairytale. Lachaise and Desfontaines. Finally we get to the interesting part. I would like you to pay attention to these documents belonging to the prisoner. The first is the absurd constitution of his fantasy kingdom. And the second is a ridiculous letter addressed to our Minister of the Interior. What is important are the signatures at the bottom of both. One from a "Lachaise", the other from a mysterious "Desfontaines". Your Honor, please. Mr Tounens, tell us who these two men are. Lachaise and Desfontaines are members of the government of the Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia. Lachaise is Secretary of State and Desfontaines is Secretary of the Interior. Well, I have checked the registry of Valdivia and these two men you mention don't appear anywhere. Do they really exist? Or maybe they entered Chile illegally? It seems even you don't know if they were there. They belong to your ghost kingdom. Mr Tounens, Mr Rosales never mentioned these two Frenchmen. Rosales betrayed me! Like a cat with a mouse's tail hanging out of his mouth who swears he didn't eat it. He is a liar. This entire trial has been a trap! Not a single Araucanian has been called to testify. Their voices were never heard! I don't make mistakes. I don't ever... I never, never... ever make mistakes. I never, ever get lost. Never, never... I never get lost! I never get lost! Never! We've lost the whole day! Shall I pretend it didn't happen? I know this country better than you ever will! And what the hell are you doing here anyway? You think I haven't seen you walk alone in the woods at night and speak to someone? What are you doing? It's none of your business. Damn right it is! Don't I have a right to know what you're doing here? Look at me! I told you before. I'm here to establish a kingdom! Why pretend to be confused? What are you saying? I've already told you. I am here... Why are you confused? What? Did your stuff get wet? A little. Have you been a guide here for long? Sure, my whole life. - Have some. - What is it? Moonshine. What's that? This? It's a flag. What a strange flag! What country is it from? It's the flag of a kingdom. A kingdom like... in the old days? With the king and his court and the princesses? Kingdoms still exist. - How bizarre. - It's a new kingdom. Who do you think you are? You just arrived and this land should be yours? Thank you. Is it meat soup? No, it's a stew. - "Stew"? - Yes. Actually, here it's called a "stwew". "Stwew". "St-wew"? In French you say "ragoût". Mr Tounens. The only witness in this trial has been Rosales. You are insane. How dare you come here and challenge the Republic of Chile and its laws? What arrogance! We are listening to the ravings of a madman! He is not even worth the rope to hang him with! He is not worth any more of the court's time! Let the French deal with their own garbage! Send him back! You shall leave. And you shall never return! It's over, Mr Tounens. Your Honor, please! Silence in the court! Mr Tounens, your trial ends here. Your sentence is exile. Thank you, Your Honor. If you ever set foot in Chile again, you shall be executed. Take him away. I've been poisoned. My skin stinks. What king has not suffered? Beloved subjects, you know how I was exiled from our land. How I tried countless times to return. How I searched for you and how I was forced to flee time and again. But I beg you, never believe that I gave up on our noble dream. Don't forget me. My beloveds. Chapter 5 THE EXILE Let's go back south. To the end of the world. To Tierra del Fuego. You will be in peace. My beloved subjects. My beloveds... Your king has returned. Your return was foretold. I have returned. I stand at the very end of this mighty continent, facing the Strait of Magellan. Across this great stretch of water lies Tierra del Fuego, island of the Patagons, the race of giants. Mythical creatures from the dawn of time. The only place left for them is this barren strip of earth at the end of the world. I focus my thoughts on this wall of water and breathe deeply, filling my lungs with this southern wind. The breath of God. Inhale... Exhale... I open my eyes and the water has vanished. The way has been opened to us. It is a miracle. A miracle. Dearest children. Don't be afraid. Trust in me. I will fill you with the divine spirit and lead you towards a new dawn. Who will come with me? Who will be the first to take a step towards liberation? Your fidelity during my absence will be rewarded. But now you must spread the news of my coming. We have awaited this joyous day so long, Your Majesty. Oh, Great One, we welcome you! Dear subjects, we must make haste and work together to make our kingdom strong again. Praise be to you! It shall be accomplished. It shall be accomplished. Praise be to you. Kings of old and kings of new Have sought the honey Of our morning dew Rise, for if you be king Then drink you must Forsake us And thy kingdom shall turn to dust. Oh, majestic oracle, I thank you for this cup of dew. I plead your mercy and forfeit my heart to your everlasting words. Worldly domains wither and fold 'Tis the kingdom of dreams The truest gold This is my kingdom. The future empire. The new France. Like Adam, I come to start a new race. The bravest ever known. Baptized by fire. I sense something. A smell announcing change. I am an Archangel. Or a corpse? What have my sins been? May the sun come out. You have a thought. You who dominate all of your children. Make an effort Father above, Mother above. Give me strength Father and Mother. Our heart is awake. The ashes have fallen. Take away your ashes. May no more ashes fall. We haven't considered what the Ngenechen is saying. "We are going to punish the brothers", Ngenechen says. And we are all going to suffer. Both of us will suffer. The Judgement has arrived, brother. This is bad. It seems He has become mad... The Master of Nature, Ngenechen. That is why it is dark, brother. That is why my heart is angry. We are mad. This shouldn't have happened. We have to wake up from this. The Winka must leave. He must stay away. Epilogue THE APOCALYPSE I am the bird that flies The source of names The child of a thousand waterdrops I am the star son Beast of straw Tongue of lies I am the drinker of silvery milk The eater of mud blossom Lungs of fire Divine heart of sand I am king. Birds call my name. They call: king, king... King... King... I am king. Oh, nightmare! The horror has possessed us! The violence and the hatred. You have been hunted like wild dogs. Your villages have been burned to the ground. You suffered plagues! Rape! The kingdom has drowned in your blood. It has been buried. Lost to time. Yet another forgotten dream. The ashes cover everything. Day becomes night. I can no longer see. Where is my body? Where is my kingdom? I am king Sun king Star king I am king Mud king, Bird king I am king King of rats King of Chimeras I am king King of the hanging heads I am king King of Diamonds King of Hearts I am king. In 1878, our king died in Tourtoirac, his home town. He spent his last days poor and alone. A tombstone bears his name, but no one knows where his body is buried. The kingdom still exists in exile, in France. The titles have passed from generation to generation. The Mapuche, Tehuelche, Selknam, Yagan, Kaweshkar and other indigenous peoples of Latin America have suffered genocide, exile and persistent discrimination. Their struggles continue today. THE END
