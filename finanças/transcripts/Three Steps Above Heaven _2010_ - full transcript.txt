One day it happens. You 're standing somewhere and you realize you don't want to be any of those around you. You don't want to be the dickhead you just beat up. Your honor, I've got 15 stitches here and 25 here. Or your father, or your brother, or anyone in your fucking family. Son of a bitch! The accused will stand. This court finds Hugo Olivera Castro guilty of assault, Or the judge. And sentences him to 18 months in prison, commuted to a fine of 6,000 euros as this is a first offense. Or even yourself. Court is adjourned. You just want to run away. You must be careful from now on. There can be no more violent incidents. Another offense means you'll go to prison. Hugo, are you listening? - Why didn't mom come? - She's on a trip. And don't call me Hugo. Fuck. Get the hell out of wherever you are. Come on! And suddenly it happens. Something clicks. And you know that things are going to change. They've changed already. Dogface! Yeah, you! Dogface. And they'll never be the same again. - Bye, dad. - Bye. Never. And when it happens, you know. THREE METERS ABOVE THE SKY - Babi! - Okay. Hurry! Good morning. Silence. Silence! - May I? - Late. Close your notebooks, please. She'll pick me. Fernéndez Camino, Luna Vergara, and Duenas Martin... No, she's outside. Absent. So, Herreruela. Translation. Take your phone. Domus itinere eunte, moltus ambulantus fuit. Herreruela... On the way home he had to walk a lot. A lot. You'll have to study a lot to get into college. Cell. Miss Alcézar, won't you take my call? Sit down. We'll continue. De strictus sensi cui super impia. Babi! I'm sorry. - It's OK. - Silence! Mara, doing it a few times doesn't mean you're dating. So what? Anyway, his pals told me he never calls. And you believe his pals? Just look at them. Claudio, change your tie. This looks better. - Girls, are you ready? - Yes, mom. If you want a lift, we're leaving now! With this make-up, how old do I look? At least 15. But I am 15. Let's see. Like that, you're about to turn 16. H! I wouldn't ask, but it's urgent. I need 400 euros for my bike. - It's in the repair shop! - Don't worry about that now. Chino! We've got a new contest on the Bandstand! Are you ready? The countdown has started! Who'll be king of the Bandstand? On your marks! Get ready! Go! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Don't act like you're desperately seeking someone. But I am. There he is! Dani! - Don't go... - Hi, Rubén! Shit, with all that make-up I didn't recognize you. Would you like something? Yes, come on. Thirty! Thirty one! Thirty two! Thirty three! - Thirty four! - That's the first one down! Katina! I thought you weren't coming! I was at another party, but it was full of gays. A real bore. Someone else who was bored brought me here. That's him, chasing Berta's brother. Hello! - Happy birthday! - Oh, yes! Thank you. Want some? No? Well, the drinks are back there and there's a bar outside. See you later! I love this song. Let's talk to my new gay friend. Fifty one! Fifty two! Fifty three! Travolta, you're slipping! Fifty six! Fifty seven! Eighty two! Eighty three! Eighty four! Eighty five! Ten seconds! Come on! Let's have a final sprint! One, two, three, four, five, six... Come on! Seven, eight. Nine, - and ten! - Ten! There's a new king of the Bandstand! Chino has lost his throne after two years! There's a private party up town! - Can we go? - Sure, I've got tickets! - Coming? - Not to a rich kids' party. Will you ever forgive me? I've been looking for a reason to do it, but I can't find one. Typical of a woman. See? That "typical" is what ruins everything. You're beautiful tonight. Tonight? Always. Alicia, your brother rang, he's coming with some friends. But I'm an only child! - Yes? - Hello! - Who's my brother? - Sis! Sis! There are canapés... Listen to the music! My little sister! Close the door! What do you want? MY purse. - Take it. - I can't. Some idiot got it first. Here. Didn't your mother tell you not to snoop in girls' purses? I don't know my mother. - But I'd tell yours something. - Really? What? You can't go around with just 50 euros. That's my week's allowance. - It was. - Now I'll go hungry. If you want, I'll buy you lunch tomorrow. You know what? When I'm paying, I like to choose my company. - What's that? - Never mind! Stop it! Stop! Holy shit! Forget about lunch. What would we do after? Tell jokes? Look, I wouldn't laugh at yours and you wouldn't understand mine. The jokes, I mean. Half-wit! If you dare take any alcohol I'll tell mom. Excuse me? Don't you remember? I accompanied you to school this morning. Well, I was your escort. You were the one shouting stupidities. No, I just said one. "Dogface". You liked it, right? It always works with girls like you. Like me? Up-tight and keen to break out. Do you want something? A Coca-cola, please. I have to drive. Babi? No, I served myself. See? When you're pleasant you're not such a dogface. What? - Chico! - Pollo, take this. No, put me down, you brute! Let go of me! No, no! I'm sorry I threw the milk shake at you! The damage has been done. You're out of your mind! I'm wearing a Valentino! - It's freezing! - It's good for the circulation. It pumps more blood to your brain. You offer milk shakes, you don't throw them at people. And tell Valentino the dress looks a lot better wet. The police, please. Shall I get you a towel? You don't want to catch cold. Go to hell! Move, they rang the cops! Remind me the next time we bathe together to wash your mouth with soap. Why did you do nothing when he threw me in the pool? Babi, it was all a set-up. I rang those idiots to cause a fuss so I could be with you. Roberta will never forgive you. They wrecked the house. What the hell...? What are they doing? Go away! Stop it, please! This is my father's car! Bastards! You want aggro? - You're fucking crazy! - Go to hell! Are you OK? Shit! It's nothing. Just some scratches. - They could have killed us! - It's all right. There's still time. - I'm sorry! - Sorry? For what? Tell me. For calling the police or for the hit and run? You're so sexy. Leave him alone, you animal! You brute! Leave him alone! You're despicable! You want to grovel? All right, say after me: - I will not ruin the party... - Stop! I will not ruin the party for people who know how to have fun. I won't ruin the party... Please, help me! For people who know how to have fun. - Mr. Santamaria! - What's going on? They're going to kill each other! Boys, that's enough! Let's get out of here! Babi, come with us! Fuck, it was your fault that I hit him! You made me hit him! Get in the car! - I won't... - I won't ruin... That's it. Leave him alone! I hate you! You're an animal, a brute! I hate you! Put me down! All right, I've put you down. And he's gone. I'll say goodbye too. How do I get home? - Let me get on the bike. - What? Let me get on the bike. You said I'm an animal and a brute, right? I can't let someone like that take you home. It's for your own good. Tomorrow you'd regret not being consistent. Stop, please. Want to go somewhere? You want your face smashed? Scram. Scram! Get on, I've fought enough people because of you. Wait, wait. I'm paralyzed. You're squeezing me. If you grab my jacket I can't drive. Please... You want to stay like this all night? Sorry, I've never ridden on the back of a bike. So I'm the first, right? Shit! Babi! - Did you come on that bike? - No, mom... She had no choice, ma'am, really. The boy who was driving her dumped her and she had to come with me. Hi, mom! Didn't I tell you to stay with your sister! - Hello. - Hi. Get in the car. You two won't have any kind of phone for a week! You're exactly like your mother. A grouch. Are you seeing that guy? I don't even know him. He's Hugo Olivera, but they call him H. Something horrible happened and he wants to forget his name. My friends and I say it's H for "hero". He looks like he'd save your life. Who the hell let you in? - Get up, you've things to do! - Yeah, for you! No, I understand. But I could go to Paris next week and we'll close the deal. Alex, I need to borrow 400 euros. Fuck, what a drag. Wait. We'll talk to Head Office. Yeah, sure. OK. What are you doing? Give me that! Are you crazy? Don't give it to him! Don't speak! Don't speak! Yes, of course. In my wallet, in my jacket. Yes! - No, of course. - Thank you! Really, if he can't, I'll see to it. Hugo, remember about dinner with dad. Are you sure it's here? Yeah, I saw it in her diary, and we're having lunch. - You're broke. - She said she'd pay. - Hello. - Hi. That's her! - Which one? - The blonde. - Bye, Babi. - Bye. And that's the girl from the foam bath. I'm Off. God, Babi! That's the guy who stole my allowance. - Which one? - The ugly one beside the bike. Oh, no! Did he steal from you too? No, but his pal threw me in the pool and wrecked Chico's car. You never tell me the interesting things! Hello. What are you doing here? Hey, take it easy. I just came with my friend, he's having lunch with that girl. But she happens to be my best friend and your friend stole all her money. You owe me one. Why not invite me somewhere nice? What do you say? Moron! How sweet! Coming for lunch? You can't have lunch with him! But he's paying, so I'll get some of my money back. I thought she was paying. I swiped her money yesterday so it's like she was paying. Don't be angry. I'll call you later. Excuse me. Just to show I'm not a liar, didn't you and I have a foam bath yesterday? That's a yes. - Hi, mom. - Hello, love. Why is your brother so late? You know him, he's always working. Where's mom? On a trip, with a girl friend. What grade will you get? 8 or more? In Physics? A distinction, definitely. I'm popping out. Do you need anything? No, I'll take a break later. Wrap up well if you go out. It's freezing. Yes, mom. Rebeca, did your son ever argue with that man before? I didn't even know they knew each other. With his injuries, if we don't have some proof Hugo could be in big trouble. Do you think I don't want to help my son? Hugo. Have you nothing to say? I'm moving in with you. Don't you want to know how it went? How did it go? If you ask like that I won't tell you. - All right, don't. - Babi! Excuse me, that blonde hunk was giving you the eye. He's still doing it. Shall we follow him? Why are you looking like that? You dumped me and went off with that thug. Hey, you don't know him! He's got problems. He's got no money. His father treats him badly. But he's really nice. He asked me to the races tonight. What races? I told mom I'm sleeping at your house. - Leave a key under the mat. - I don't believe this! - Why don't you come? - No! I don't want to see him or his friend. Then we're not going to see each other either. - Why not? - I'm going out with him! Katina! - Babi! - Yes? Come here a moment. Coming. What? Haven't you something to tell us? The Santamarias rang. Felipe's nasal septum was broken, it almost pierced his brain! - I had nothing to do with it. - It's true, she didn't. Who asked you? Be quiet! Look, Babi they want to report your friend. They want to know his name. He's not my friend. I just know he's called H. Are you defending him? How long have you known him? The only thing I know is his nickname! You know his name, tell them! - Do you think I'm a telltale? - You told me his name. Daniela, his name. Hugo Olivera. That's his name, dad. Call them, and say Babi had nothing to do with it. Great, Babi, you've really put your foot in it! Daniela... My parents are out. Yes, she's here. But I reckon that in a week she'll be dead. She informed on a dangerous guy, and she likes him. Stop talking about me and hang up. Wait, I've got another call. Yes? Yes, just a minute. It's for you. Yes? Good evening! Yes. Katina? She's sleeping. Shall I wake her? Yes, I'll tell her. Good night. Bye. What's going on? What is it? Who was that? It's turned off. Where are the bike races? The Siamese races? At the port. - Can I go? Please... - No way. And don't tell anyone. Know where my sister's going? WE REMEMBER YOU No, stop, Pollo! What a surprise! I'm so glad you've come! Why is your phone off? Your mother rang. - What did you tell her? - That you were asleep, and she believed me. She's picking you up tomorrow at 7:00 for your blood tests. Don't be late, I don't want any problems. - Come on, stay! - No! We're going for a pizza. I doubt I'd eat the pizzas you eat. Well, it's the untamed shrew! Have you come to see me race? I didn't even know you were here. Then why are you red as a beetroot? You just make me laugh. - Yeah? - Yes. You won't be so cocky in court. I said it was you who broke Mr. Santamaria's nose. - You bitch! - Take it easy. You could go to prison! That won't happen, OK? The day I'm up in court this nice girl will say I did nothing. Know why? Why? By then you'll be so crazy about me you'll do anything to save me. The race is starting! The race is starting! Want to ride behind me? Never. H, will you take me? Get on. Stop being scared and you'll have fun. You don't even have a belt. This is just for Siamese. So, race or fuck off. She's a real cow. - What did you say? - I'm racing now. Well, then? Give me your belt. Babi, no! Shit, my scarf! Get on! Are you crazy? Don't! I haven't got all day. Good luck! Belts off! Come on! Up! Up! Last lap! Chino! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Shit! Forget the bike, help her! Don't move her! - Lift her up! - Call an ambulance! Get on! Get on! The cameras! Cover the license plate! Hide here! I'll pick you up once I shake them off. Quick! Shit! I'm here. - Where? - Here. Why are you in there? Come out. There's a huge dog out there. There's no dog here. I still can't come out. Why? I'm embarrassed. Come out now or I'll leave. No, wait! Wait! What? Promise you won't laugh. I promise. What have you done, kid? - Are you covered in mud? - It's manure. That's manure? I don't believe it! This is too good to be true. I knew it. Your promises are worthless. - Wait, what are you doing? - I'm getting on the bike! Are you crazy? You're covered in shit. - You're joking, right? - No. If you want, you can wear my jacket. But first take off those clothes or you can't get on the bike. Fuck, this is disgusting! - Look, H... - I like how that sounds. It's the first time you've said my name. If you turn round I swear I'll jump on you and cover you with manure. And I do keep my promises. Don't look! I've got no interest in looking. I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry. You're a filthy, disgusting bastard! I didn't turn round, did I? But you've got a great ass. I wish I'd rubbed the manure in your face. Now I do hear a rabid dog. - Hurry up! - Look! Lift your legs or he'll bite you! Thank you for the lift. So I'll pick you up tomorrow. What time? Sure, and the police can chase us again. Right. You were a very brave Siamese. Are you going to report me? - Yes. - Yes? Really? Do you swear? Oh, Babi, Babi! I'm a pig, an animal, a beast, but you'd let me kiss you. - You're inconsistent. - And you're a bastard! You had your mouth open, begging me to kiss you. Give me back my jacket right now. Hotlips, what about a good night kiss? Go to hell! I was really worried. Your mom thought I was you and gave me a good night kiss. - What happened? - It was H, wasn't it? He tore off your clothes. You'll wake mom. Well? I'm going to shower. She smells of shit. Sorry, the police were after me. Liar, I saw you go off with that stuck-up little mouse. Illegal races cause disturbances in the pan' area. Throw it up to me! Come on! She raced as a Siamese and saved a girl who had an accident. It's really wild. - Are you going Out? - No! Sure. Katina, not again. I'm not going out. Look who's waiting for you. Babi! You're seeing H, aren't you? If mom and dad ask, I'm studying at Katina's. OK. I'll be back by 11:00. I'm the hero's sister-in-law. H... Got a light? What's up? New projects. Good luck, I don't think that prude will open her legs so easily. I'll call you, OK? Vodka with pineapple. Dogface. Brute. Mom, why are you still up? Why are you behaving as if you weren't my daughter? It got late. Come here! - Were you drinking? - You know I don't drink. What's that boy doing to you? - Is he making you do anything? - Nothing I don't want to do. Is anything wrong? No, dad, I came home late, that's all. I got his license plate. - Talk to him. - They're just kids.
