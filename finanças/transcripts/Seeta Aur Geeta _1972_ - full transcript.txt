Brother, we are in trouble. She is my wife.. ..we were returning from Shirdi and our car broke down on the way... ..she is in labour, can we come in for sometime? Call them in! - Please come in! Thank you very much, will I find a doctor here? - Doctor? So a baby is expected? - Yes. Your wife is expecting? - Yes, doctor. Please hurry up! - Yes, I am! Please come. Congratulations sir, God has given you a very pretty daughter! How is Rama? - She is perfectly alright. She has just fallen asleep. Here you are! Great! She was born even before I could get here. Doctor, please don't get upset at my daughter's haste. Thanks for the trouble you took to come here. Here is your fees. - What is the need for this? Actually I need it! Aunt Leela, the medicine you gave me for a cold, really worked. Doctor, you've taken fees to come here. Do you also collect to leave? Okay, I am leaving! Thank you. - It's alright. Please take this. Please take this money. Sir, we may be poor but we can't accept this. Please keep it back. Then you tell me, what can I do for you? Sir, we don't have a child... please pray that we also get a child... actually, a child was born in our house last night... what I mean is that even my wife should... He has understood! - Yes, I will surely pray for you. You'll have done us a big favor, if we would get twin daughters... then I would surely give you one of my daughters. Okay, good bye! - Good bye, sir. Good bye. Okay, good bye. Listen, come here... Why did you do this? - They really did get twin daughters. So you hid one of them? - So what? What would they do with two identical daughters? Didn't he say that if they would get twins, he'd give us one! He said it that doesn't mean he'd do it, even I say a lot of things! Why didn't you think how we'll raise a child from a rich family? We'll give her the love that is rarely found in the rich families! Grandmother, your cough has increased. Yes child but yet, I don't die! Grandmother, have this medicine. I am losing my eyesight too! But I don't mind because, I cannot see... the torture that is meted out on you. Wretched girl! Even the servants are not called like this! You go, child. - But grandmother... Are you dead? - Go child, don't bother about me. Yes, aunty. I've been calling you since past two hours. Couldn't you hear me? Aunty, grandmother... - Damn that old woman! We'll be relieved if she dies! I feel like conducting her final rites when she is alive! Stop staring! Will you get me hot water or will your ancestors get it? I'll get it. Will your legs break if you walk faster? I've not seen a bigger idiot than you! It's time for my college and you've not yet ironed my sari? I'll do it, Sheila. - Hurry up, stupid! Did you get the soap? - I'll get it. Wonder why she is with us! She will never do anything unless you don't tell her. Why don't you tell her anything? Wait a minute! And what are you doing there? I was just polishing my shoes! Have you worked all your life that today you are doing this? Hey, wretched girl! Polish these shoes. But... - Give it to her. Giving! Here, child. - Polish them quickly. Why did you ask her to do it, the poor girl does many other things. Do you ever see how much she eats the whole day? If she does some exercise, her fat will burn out! She gets hot water for you everyday, why don't you repair the geyser? I'll do that only when the lawyer will get this month's allowance. Didn't Seeta's father trust you even a bit... why did he entrust the entire property to the lawyers before dying? This bungalow is also in Seeta's name and what do we get? All we get is Rs. 5,000/- per month. That too we'll get only till Seeta gets married. Her marriage! Sir, your tea. Old man, who asked you to get tea for me? Where is that pretty girl? You mean Seeta, she is attending to Madam's chores. Idiot, anybody can attend to sister's chores... ask her to attend to me, give me a match! Listen, I don't want to see your mug from tomorrow morning. Get out now! No, while you iron this sari, I'll polish these shoes. Both the jobs will be done soon! - And what if your mother sees? She'll scold me. And if you are late, she will yet scold you! Alright, do it but don't dirty your hands. Sure. Seeta, are you going to get the soap or shall I come and hit you? Oh my, I forgot! I'll get it, aunty! What took you so long to get a bar of soap? Get out from here! Seeta. Yes. - Please come here. I have a lot of work. - Will you stand there and talk to me? Come inside. I won't eat you up, why don't you do things for me too? Will you do it? - What do you want me to do? You are very simple! Okay, can you stitch up this button? You keep it aside, I'll do it in the afternoon. It will take two minutes, do it now. Here is the needle and thread and the button too! Here. I mean it, Seeta. I feel very sorry to see you in this state. But you are to be blamed for this, just trust me once... nobody will tell you a word but you think that I am your enemy! Look what she has done! - What happened? Mummy! - Coming! Sheila, please forgive me. I am sorry. What happened, child? Aunty, I am extremely sorry, there were too many things at a time... Liar! Mother, she burnt my sari! You louse! How dare you? - What happened? It happened by mistake. - It was by mistake... or you did it purposely? You are jealous of my daughter! Why would I be jealous of her? - How dare you argue? What she did? I will skin your hide! - Aunty! Don't beat her! - Forgive me, aunty. I will kill you today! Stop interfering, move away! Get inside! Only when you'll be locked in here, will you realize. Only when you'll not be fed for 4-5 days you'll value things. Kaushalya. Open the door. - You keep quiet, you've spoilt her! If you open the door, I won't spare you. Forgive her. Mother, father, why did you'll leave me? Nobody loves me here! Mother, I would like to come to you! Please come in, Mr. Gupta. What is the matter, you don't look alright. Nothing much, I've got cold, you please sit! You should have called a doctor. - Ramu, get tea and snacks quickly! Hello! - Hello! There is no need to call for anything. I am in a hurry, please call Seeta. You come here as if it's a duty. - Well, it is a duty. Your brother made me the trustee of his entire wealth. But the responsibility of such a vast wealth is not at all easy. Mr. Gupta, you have not seen our responsibility. We have raised this orphan girl as our own child. We always have the fear that people may criticize our upbringing. You do take care of her! - But yet, I live under that fear. I don't want to lack anything in my responsibility. I suggest that you get her married. Your responsibility will end and so will mine! As per brother's will, our responsibly is till her marriage. Have you'll seen any suitable boy for her? We've seen dozens of them! But I feel that not a single one is suitable for our Seeta. Mr. Gupta, why don't you suggest some good proposal? Isn't it, Kaushalya? - Yes, even we will keep looking! Yes, I will look out. Come, child! Why did you get it, you should have asked the servant to get it. I'll make the tea. She loves doing household chores. Even if I stop her, she keeps doing something or the other! That's very nice, girls must be well versed with domestic chores. How are you, child? - Yes, thank you. Child, this is your monthly allowance. Take it! - Count it! What is the need for that, it must be exact! I will be convinced. - Child, give the money to your uncle. Give me. Here, take your tea. - Thank you. It's exact, Mr. Gupta. - It had to be! He was just joking about it! Don't give me, give it to the person it belongs to. Here. Alright Mr. Badrinath, permit me to leave. Have some more tea. - Let him leave, he is a busy man! She's right, I am in a hurry. God bless you. Good bye! What are you doing here? Come on, take this tray inside. You seem to be in a great hurry to get your niece married. Don't you know the day she gets married, you'll be out on the street! That's right but... - Damn you and your buts!! That too is right! Seeta. Yes, grandmother. - Come here, child. Sit close to me. You are looking very beautiful. You look like a princess! You mark my words, one day a prince in a shining armor will come... and will sweep away my princess and take her to his kingdom! These are mere fairy tales, no prince will ever come! Grandmother, you are very nice! Seeta. Grandmother, I am going! Aunty, you called. Yes, why are you yet dressed like this? Remove the jewellery and this sari! Don't you feel like taking them out? Give it soon and what about this sari? I'll go in my room and take it out. - Why there? Take it out here! Stop this act of a chastity, shameless girl!! Take it out and go and cook the food! Aunty, how can I... - What do you mean? Are you going or shall I hit you? Oh! So my sister did manage to take out your clothes? Why have you left the rest, do they belong to you? Ranjit sir. What is it, old man? - You had asked for cigarettes. Throw them for all I care! Grandmother!! - Stop crying, my child!! Why can't I die? - Don't say that, my child! Grandmother... - Don't say a word, child. I understand your tears! God, isn't there anybody in this world who can save her from them? "Life's a game, some win, some lose..." "there are experts, and there are novices" "Do you get it, mister...? Or perhaps you, fatso?" "There are experts and there are novices" "Life's a game. Some win, some lose..." "there are experts, and there are novices" "Do you get it mister...? Or maybe you have? "There are experts and there are novices" "Cut the nonsense. Get to work, Raka" "Oh yes, it's work that will bring you fame" "Cut the nonsense. Get to work, Raka" "Oh yes, it's work that will bring you fame" "You're like a bird in flight, I swear by you" "Don't you fall... watch your step" "Get that, mister...? Or perhaps you, sister?" "There are experts and there are novices" "There are experts and there are novices" "Step back, children... - Sit down" "Turn around, snobbish one" "And people will give you a round of applause" "Applause!" "Turn around, snobbish one" "And people will give you a round of applause" "A true spectacle I will show them..." "every heart, I will send pounding" "Get that, sardarji? Get it, lady?" "There are experts and there are novices" "Life's a game. Some win, some lose. "There are experts and there are novices" "Got it, mister? - Or you, Pathan?" "There are experts and there are novices" "There are experts and there are novices" Raja, Cheena, me. Raja, Cheena, me. Damn it! - What is the matter, chief? Nothing Cheena, it's just my bad luck. I bet on the wrong number. - But you were given a right tip! I saw number six last night in my dream and I bet on that number. And now I've lost the money! What do you think will be the number today? Ace! Are you sure? - Yes, I am! I've never won the way you do! Come on, take your share. - Geeta, you've made an equal share. Raka, you can play five times today. What about the notes that are under your feet? What do you mean? Move your leg and give me that money! Oh, these? Don't shout, I did not hide them purposely. You do it everyday but when I get angry, you'll realise it! Just try doing that, don't forget my name is Geeta! Even my name is Raka, I'll break your legs! What did you say? Do you think you are a don? How dare you show me that knife? - Leave her, chief! You steal and then you show this knife? Apologize to him! I don't want to work with her, does she think we cannot do without her? No, the public throws money when you show your juggling tricks! Such things happen chief, why make it a big issue? Nonsense! How could she threaten me? You are back, Geeta. - Mother, I am very hungry. You will drop the tray, come with me to the temple. You go there, I'll go home and eat something. I haven't cooked, I'll come back and make something. I'll be famished by then! Geeta, why are you straining your eyes in the night? Cheena told me that today, you fought with Raka again. We do it everyday but actually, it was my fault. Stop fighting with the poor boy, think of your future. I may not live long, I suggest you hold his hand. But why should I hold Raka's hand? You fool, I am talking about your marriage! You mean with Raka? - Why, what does he lack? He may be a little hot tempered but he has a clear heart! Mother, you are getting senile! Yes, I have! It's a sin to talk to you. What is it? - The bride groom is coming! Where is it? Finished? You're also good. Did you see, he is a drunkard, can I marry such a man? No, a prince will come here to marry you. Yes, a prince in a shining armor will come to marry me. Good shot, Ravi. - Thank you, Mr. Gupta. Have you seen this stick, how light it! Beautiful. Along with a medical degree from London, I've got this golf stick too! That way you're an exception, Ravi. I've seen that men often get a foreign wife when they go abroad. That is their problem! I don't say that women out there are not good... Most of them are nice girls. there's a big difference in our culture & marriage is impossible! What is your image of an ideal wife? A sari clad girl, who cooks well... a very simple, Indian woman! What kind of girl does that damn doctor want? A very simple Indian girl, just like our Seeta. A very simple Indian girl, just like our Seeta? Yes. Sheila. Come, child. Greetings. God bless you! Is she the one? - No, she is my daughter, Sheila. She is doing her B.A. Mother, can I get some tea or coffee? -No child, Ramu will get it. She is very fond of doing domestic chores. She doesn't have any habits of a modern girl. Child, why didn't you get Seeta along? She's in her room... - I'll go and get her. You talk to aunty, I'll be right back! Ramu, how does the boy look? You must have seen him. - He looks very decent. He'll make a good husband for Seeta. - Listen, what is his name? Ravi, why are you so quiet? - What should I say? Talk as much as you want, after your marriage, you won't get that chance! Isn't it, Mr. Badrinath? Walk down or I will... - Aunty!! Come. Sit here, child! Sit down! Is she Seeta? - Yes! Mr. Gupta told us something else! He speaks about the 18 century... if these girls will not be fashionable then will we be? Besides, this is the age of progress, isn't it Ravi? Right, I think our country has progressed more than the west! They would like to have tea made by you, go get it. Go!! Go!! Ramu, give the tray to Seeta. How did you fall, what is the matter? Did you hurt yourself? I am sorry, your clothes are stained. Let's leave, son! - Come on. Please don't leave. - No, it's quite late. We'll come some other time, let's go Ravi. But Mr. Chaudhary... - Let's go! Please wait Mr. Chaudhary, please listen to me... Please don't insult us and go. I assure you that you what you are seeing is absolutely wrong! My Seeta is not like that, she will serve you whole heartedly. For God's sake, please stop. - What can I do? Ravi, please accept this proposal. Well, I... - I plead to you, son. No grandmother, please stop it! Ravi. Kaushalya, whatever you are doing is not right! You?! - Who else could it be? I am the only one who writhes in pain when I see your sorrows! But don't worry, if not Ravi, I am still there! You can find better boys! Ranjit, you please go from here. You are great! You want to mourn for a stranger... and the ones who are crazy about you, you don't even look at them! You please go or else... - Or else what? I will scream. - If you scream you will be defamed. Please go away! - Scream, I will not go!! Grandmother! Uncle! Grandmother! Seeta. What happened? What happened? What happened? Come fast. Come fast. What happened? Tell me, where is my wallet, thief? Where is the thief? - In front of you! Aunty, he is lying. Shut up! Talk when I ask you to talk! What is the matter, Ranjit? - She cleaned my room today. After that my wallet was missing, who else could have taken it? You wretched, horrible girl, you've started stealing too? Uncle, I have not stolen anything. You can search my room. - Yes, you can check her room. Yes sister, let's both search her room. Here it is! Detestable girl! You steal and then you make false promises! Sister, you move away, your thrashing will not affect her. You come here. You thief! I will skin your hide! Grandmother. Someone please save her! You thief! Please don't hit her! For God's sake, please stop! Stop, Ranjit!! Grandmother, please save me! My child. This old woman will save you? Grandmother, please save me! - Ranjit, let her go, I plead to you. Please don't hit her! Then tell her to stay within her limits... or else I will skin her hide! Grandmother! - Stop crying, child! Where are you? Oh! You are here! What happened? - Ask what did not happen? Do you know what your niece has done? What did she do now? - What can she do, she has run away! Seeta has run away?! - Oh God, what will we do now? What will we tell people, we have been defamed! You are more concerned about the allowance. The way you'll were behaving with her, she had to run away! Will you just lecture me or even do something? We should do something but what should I do? Look for her, report the matter to the police. That's right! - Leave this now! I did not like her behavior these days. She was acting too big for her shoes! Why Ranjit had to go to Delhi this morning? Did you get the number? Hello! Police station. - Hello, Inspector Rana speaking. I am Badrinath speaking. Actually, my niece... Seeta, has left the house! And we are very worried about her. You come to the police station, I'll write down your report. And yes, do get her photograph. Yes! What will we do if we don't find her? That wretched Gupta will not give us a penny! O God, please have mercy on us! Aunty, what have you cooked today? The stove has become cold but I wonder where Geeta is! She has gone to buy vegetables! In that case you observe a fast today. She is playing marbles with the children of the area. What, I have been waiting for her and she's playing marbles? Her marbles are very lucky, she always wins! Are your marbles over? Here, play with them. - Give it to me! Now tell me which one should I aim? - The green one! The green one! You are cheating, you're crossing the line! What did you say? Don't waste time, hurry up! - I get angry if someone provokes me! Shall I aim the green one? - Yes. What are you doing here? - I was just playing! You've been missing since past 2 hours. Why are you hitting me? Do you want me to love you because, you've made me happy? Good that Raka told me you were here! - Oh! So he told you? I will not spare you, you creep! - Wild cat!! You are wild cat!! Aunt, beat him. What do you think of yourself? You Keep beating me every now and then I'll run away from home. I will not look for you! Raka, go get her! Aunty, she has gone, what will we do about our work now? Why you had to hit her, she was just playing with marbles! Should you hit with a stick, look at her! You! You are so big and yet you are crying? What is the matter, did someone hit you? Why don't you say? - That man took my school fees! Oh! You have lost your school fees in gambling? Why did you play? Alright, come with me! Come on, bet your money! Bet on your cards! Talk to me, aren't you ashamed to dupe a child? I've not duped him, he has lost that money in gambling. It's as good as duping, come on, give his money back! What if I don't? - You want to see? I can deal very well with people like you. Stop pushing me! - Confess in front of him. Sir. Sir, he has a gambling den in our area. He even looted this poor boy's school fees. What nonsense are you talking? - Raghu, you've started again? I was broke, sir. - How much money did you play for? 20. Put him in the cell and take out Rs. 20/- and give it to this child. If you gamble next time then I will lock you up too! Go. Out you go now and you... you come with me, I want your statement! My statement! - Tukaram, get me a glass of water. I'll give my statement but I won't get involved in court matters. After all, I am a service class girl. It's strange that you've come here. I am a very bold person. I can go anywhere. Hello, is that Mr. Badrinath? We have found her, she is here. You come here quickly within 5 minutes. Sir, my statement? - I'll just have it typed. But tell me, why did you go away from home? Actually sir, I don't like this everyday hassle! That is why I left home, now let them look for me! Never mind, I've called them up, they must be on their way. Who they? - Your uncle and aunt! Who did you say? - Your uncle and aunt! I don't have an uncle nor an aunt! That's bad, such small fights cannot sever relationships! Don't say that, Seeta! - Seeta?! What confusion is this? My name is Geeta and I am leaving, good bye! Catch her, don't let her run!! Open the door quickly! What is this? Inspector, where is our niece, Seeta? Tell us soon, where is she? Oh, my! - See it for yourself! Come down, child! - You come up, fatso! Seeta my child, we are your uncle and aunt! You look like a pair of cartoons to me! We've come to take you home. - Am I your father's property? Look, if you don't come down then I'll put on the fan! Don't do that, I will come down! Uncle! - Dear. Aunty!! Which oil do you use? - What? Can we take her home? - Please do that! Let's go now! - Stop screaming. Thank you very much, inspector. Let's go now! Tukaram. Thank you very much! - Will you come along now? Let's go now! Sit down! This car is really very good! Uncle, where are we going? We are going home. - Home?! Whose house? You'll know it in sometime, I'll thrash you on reaching home! Why do you keep nudging me, fatso? - What? I lovingly told you, fatso! Did you hear that? - Forget it, she's a child. I'll cut off your tongue, did you understand? What nonsense is this, at the police station you were calling me child... and here you are... - Shut up! Oh! She's there, stop the car!! Go after her and catch her! She's is our daughter and she's mad, we were taking her to the asylum... and now she has run away, please help us to catch her! Please help us, hurry up!! Oh my God! Oh! She jumped on the other side, get her! Hey, do something. "Smoke! The pain will be erased. Chant day and night" Hey! What are you doing? You've damaged my car! Come out and see what you've done! Do you have a problem with your eyes, can't you see properly? How could you use your brakes suddenly? Who gave you a licence? Forget it, let's go! - You keep quiet! He's my youngest son but what about this bumper that you've broken? What do you think you were driving, you've broken my headlights too! Why don't you wear glasses? How can you drive like this, without giving a signal, you use the brakes? Hey! Talk to me! - I can talk to anyone I feel like! Why did you use the brake? - Did he use the brake of your car? How can you use brakes of my car, it's not for public! We put brakes on our car. - So what? Tell me now. - You should've seen that I was behind There's nothing worth seeing in you! Don't act smart! Don't argue with me. We don't have eyes at the back of our heads! You were behind, you could have seen us! What is she saying? Don't act tough with me, I'll file a police complaint against you! Shirin, note down their number! He went away!! If you get involved in a squabble, this is the way you should talk! Is it so? Okay, tell me one thing... how did you get into this car? - From the door, where else? No, I mean, where did you sit in this car? On the seat, where else? I mean... - What do you mean? Forget it. - No, ask me! Okay, where are you going? - Where are you going? I am going to Mahableshwar to meet my parents. Does that mean half the car will go somewhere else? Not at all! Then don't ask me, even I am going to the same place. You are too much! That I am but you ask too many questions! Great! Looks like you are a very rich man! I may look but looks can be deceptive! Even you looked different on that day! Which day? That day! - Oh, that day! How was I looking? A stupid girl, trying to pursue western fashion... with excessive make up on your face! Me?! - Yes, you! And look at you today. Do you know how you look in these clothes? How? - Like a gypsy girl! That I am! - I don't know what you are! But I would surely like to know you better! Forget all this, before my parents come, go and change into a sari. Sari? - Yes. Come. But what is wrong with these clothes? They are not bad, they are very good! But is it necessary that whenever my parents see you... you should always be in a fancy dress? It's not necessary. - Then let's go! Alright! This is my sister, Nirmala's room. She is married and lives in Germany. There are few saris in this, you can choose anyone from them! I'll wear it right away! Skates. - Eskates. Skates. - Eskates. Forget it. You are supposed to tie them on your feet and then walk with them! Oh, I see! I think my parents have come, you get dressed quickly... I'll go down. Hello! Mummy! - Hello, Sonny! Hello, Dad! Son, the gardener said that some girl has come with you. Girl?! Oh, I met Seeta on the way and I got her... You got her here, what was the need? Seeta is very different from what we thought about her! What about the scene we saw the other day? It was just a drama. Drama? Yes mother, I was shocked to see her today. She gave me a real surprise. Mother, she is a very smart and a nice girl! Unless you don't see her, you will not believe me! You wait here, I'll just get her. Are you ready? Skates! - Skates. You tie it on your feet and then walk! And then you slip and fall? - Sometimes. Won't you meet my parents? - Yes, I will. Then let's go. - Come on. Just a minute! Shall we go? - Oh, yes! Aren't you an Indian girl? - Yes, I am! Then you are supposed to act coy in front of my parents. I understand. - So come on, act coy! Let's go there then I'll act coy. - Alright. That's a bit too much! That's fine, let's go. - Let's go. What will I have to do there? - Nothing, shake hands with them. What? - I am sorry... I said it wrong, just seek blessings. - Your blessings?! No, my parent's blessings. And then yours? - We'll see that later. You already know her! - Come children, sit down. You'll sit. - Yes, please sit. Seek their blessings! Is everyone fine? - Oh, yes! I liked everyone, you all! I am not talking about us, how are your uncle and aunt? Oh, my! This aunt has come here too! Well they... Child, don't they behave properly with you? In front of everyone she dotes on me and puts up an act of love... but when we are alone, she acts like a demon! Mother, I had a doubt on that day itself. I had seen it myself that the other girl Sheila, kicked her! Didn't she kick you? Don't lie now! Why should I lie? Yes, she did kick me. That means the other day what we saw was just an act! I have to put up an act everyday, tell me what else can I do? I have to do all these things to satiate my hunger. Why do you need to do that? You don't live on their mercy! I have started detesting those people! That day they presented her in such a weird manner and look at her today! I always look good in borrowed clothes! We like her frankness! Child, where are your bags? - Bags?! Bags?! Oh yes, her bags! Well actually, her bags were left behind. And she came with me! God, I have nobody in this world who loves me... it's said that you love the people who are not loved by anyone! I am coming to seek your refuge. Wow! That was a brilliant jump! Hey! Stop! - Hey! Aunty!! Geeta What happened to Geeta? - Raka is getting her. She jumped in the river to commit suicide. What happened to her! - Geeta! Geeta, my child, please get up! Why isn't she talking? Where... - Don't worry, child! You are perfectly alright! - Why did you save me? You should have let me die. Don't say that, child. Nobody ends life over such a petty fight. I did not know that a small joke would lead to such a serious thing. She's alright now. What is all this? Who are you? What is the matter with you? I am your mother, Geeta! Geeta? I am Seeta! Oh God, what is wrong with my daughter? My child, don't worry, nobody will scream at you anymore! I will always love you, come close! Will you ever leave your mother now? Mother! - Stop crying, child! Yes, my child! Mother!! Oh, my God! If you hurry up then you'll surely break your bones. Let it break, you are a doctor, you can fix it! You can tie that white cloth on it, what is that called? White cloth?! Oh, you mean a plaster? Blaster! No, it's called a plaster! 'P'Laster. Not 'P' but plaster. Never mind, forget it! If you really want to learn skating... then listen to me carefully, keep your weight on the front wheels... like this, do you understand. What you do is keep your weight on the rear wheels and that is why... Doctor, if you want to learn skating then remember one thing... don't keep your weight on rear wheels, keep it on the front wheels! Like this!!... Like this!!... Like this!!... "With the winds..."

Hey! Stop. My monkey! Hey! She's the same girl. Where are you going? I am saying the truth, this is not my house! Didn't you understand? You found her! Oh God! Are you Mr. Badrinath? - Me, I... What are you thinking, you are Badrinath, tell him! Is she your niece, Seeta? - Of course not! Where did you go, my child? - I went to Mahableshwar, fat aunty! Why don't you treat her? - We'll do it and she'll be fine! Okay, we'll leave now. - Okay, let's go! Where are you going, my child? Look, enough of joking, I am going... You wretched girl!! Seeta, my child!! Seeta, my child!! My child, where did you go? Sister, where did you go? - Sure, go ahead and hug her! Stop shedding tears and ask her where she went to defame herself? Stop it, Kaushalya. I mean, why do you want to argue so much? You keep quiet, you are the one who has spoilt her! Listen to me, if you step out of the house, I will break your legs. Come, child! And what are you doing there, come with me! What happened to her? - I think she has fainted. Grandmother, please get up! Child, let's take her to her room. Child, she is burning with fever since past 3 days. Nobody is bothered about her. Look at this! Forget getting medicines but since you left... she did not even get her meals on time! Sister, one day when grandmother asked mother for medicine... she abused grandmother a lot! You know your aunt's nature... she vents out your anger on her! Seeta. Seeta. My child! Where are you, my child? Where are you, my child? Grandmother, I am here! I am close to you! Seeta. Child, where did you leave me and go? Child, will you leave me and go again? If you go away again then I will die! Will you leave me, child? No grandmother, I will not go! Until there are tears in your eyes and pain in your heart... and till injustice prevails in this house, I will not go anywhere! Chief! - What is it? There is a great news, American people have driven car on the moon! Don't fib, how can anyone drive on the moon? There is a picture in the newspaper, have a look! Oh, yes! The Americans can drive a car anywhere! But our car has stopped! Cheena, what is the matter with this girl? The fire within her is dead! - That's what even I was thinking. That jump in the water has reformed her completely! And she speaks very formally these days. It really annoys me, our business has closed down because of her! Let her not come, we'll go for work today! I am bored of sitting here! - Ask her once, let her come along. I'll not ask her, if you want, you can go and ask! Alright! It will be good if she agrees! For how many days do you intend being on strike? What? Don't you want to work, we've been home for a long time now. Yes, I do want to work. Then let's go. - Let me ask mother's permission. Child! - There she is! You have washed all the clothes?! - Ask her now! Mother, can I go for work? - Do as you please, child! What will she do at home, just see how sick and pale she looks! She'll feel better if she steps out! You'll decide amongst yourselves. - Alright, let's go! Let's go. - Will you come in this dress? Let her come the way she wants! But in this outfit?! Alright, let her try it out in this outfit. My dear friends, what trick would you all like to see? My friends, this is not an ordinary act. To walk on this tight rope which is tied on these sticks... you need to be swift, agile and alert! One slip could maim you for life! But for the sake of money, this girl will endanger her life! Go a little behind, anyone who would like to offer some money... can put it out on this cloth below! - Here is my advance! Very good. Here is my advance but the show should be good! Thank you very much, everyone please clap! Friends, now we present the girl who'll walk on this rope... like a train, come on, play the drums! Here comes that girl.... Friends, before starting the show, I'd like to say one more thing... there are decent people here, but there may also be thieves here... that is why, be alert of pickpockets... while watching the show, you wallet may get stolen. That is why my friends, watch out!! It's not easy to walk on this rope, this girl here... once she climbs up, she'll get stuck to the rope like a bat. Come on, climb up and start the show! You've put me in trouble! He said that this girl would walk on the rope. I think he is a cheat, he has picked up this girl from somewhere! He has cheated us, let's bash him up! - Sardarji, please listen to me!! Stop it! Let's hit him! Aunty, enough of it, from now on, my partnership ends with your daughter! Why are you getting so angry over such a small matter? Small matter?! Good I was saved or she would have me killed today! Who could kill you? You don't know the people of this city. It's fine if they are happy but if they are angry, they can deform you! She should have told me if she was not interested in working... we would not get into this mess! Give me a needle and a thread. My shirt tore and I lost all my money! How will we eat now? - You can eat here! You have started pampering her a lot after her suicide attempt! Come on, go in!! Give me, I'll sew it up! You'll do it? Get lost! Give it to me! Take it. Give me your shirt, I'll stitch it up. Cheena, when did she learn tailoring? Chief, can I tell you something? When a girl learns stitching... you should understand that she'll not do anything that is unfeminine! Raka, come and have lunch! Wow! Green vegetables and lentils, I love it! I am starting, chief! Aunty, it's delicious, I can kiss your hand for this! I've not made it, she's the one who has cooked today. She?! In few days she has learnt all the domestic chores! Chief, you wanted to kiss aunty's hand for the vegetables... what will you do now? - Shut up and eat your food! Seeta. - What is the matter? Mother, I'm calling her but she's not listening. I hope she has not run away again, go down and check. You are yet sleeping? Seeta, wake up! Are you getting up or shall I ask mother to thrash you? You will not listen to me! Mummy. What happened, my child? Why are you crying? What did that witch do to you? She hit me! - I'll break her hands! She kicked me! - What? I'll break her legs! Come. You witch! How dare you touch my fragile daughter? Stop chewing my brains! - How dare you! You've been exposed to the outside world and lost your senses! Just get up so that I can get you back into senses! What is wrong with you? Have you gone mad? How dare you? Shameless!... Am I shameless? - Oh! My hand!! I'll thrash you, get out! Why are you screaming like this? My hand, hurry up!! - What is the matter? What happened? That wretched girl twisted my arm! And you are asking what is the matter! She's back! - Who is back? If you ever disturb my sleep, I will deform you! I understand, child! - Oh, you are calling me child! From now on, who will cook in this house?...Tell me! I'll cook! - And the morning tea? I'll make it, I used to do it in your absence. Oh! So you used to make tea in the morning? And this buffalo used to sleep comfortably? Listen fatso, you'll make the tea! - Alright! Very good! Now go quickly and make a special cup of tea for me! I'll get it! Mother, make it for me too. - Shut up! Silence! If you raise your voice, I'll slap you! Go quickly and make for him too! - I'll get it! Kaushalya, shall I direct you to the kitchen? Come here! - Me?! Yes, you! Why is this table so dirty? From tomorrow, you'll wake up early and dust the entire furniture! Take this, sister! - Come on, start! Good. I had heard that a dog's tail can never be straightened. But how did you manage this? If you apply force then not only the tail even the dog become straight! It was a great film, worth the money! The hero tells his father, I don't want the position nor the wealth... I just want to marry the heroine! That's great, where is this film running? At Taj Talkies. - I will also see it! The emperor is a mean guy, he puts the heroine in the cell... Hey, aunt Leela's daughter! Where are you going dressed like this? Temple. - You are going to the temple?! Hey! She's going to the temple. - Why don't you come along with me? I don't need to go there, I don't need anything from God... you carry on, I don't have the time! You have the time to put up an act in front of this world... and the Almighty, for whom this world is an act... you don't have even little time for him? Look, don't talk to me like this! I am an ordinary juggler. Even God is a juggler, an ace juggler! You throw three balls in the air at one go... but there are millions of balls made by him which are in the universe. You hide a quarter in your fist and when you open it becomes half cent... but when God hides the moon in his fist... he brightens this world with the sunlight, isn't it? Wow! That was good. I suggest you should contest for elections! Okay, I am going. You and here?! - Yes, I have come here! Why are you surprised? - You came here suddenly! The way you disappear suddenly, I appear suddenly! People have different habits! Can we sit? May we sit? - Sure, sit down! What will you have? A sensible man will have nothing else but water! Don't be formal, okay tell me, is anyone at home? Why, am I not enough? Of course you are! Actually, I would like to meet your uncle too! Why, what work do you have with him? I have some work. - But what is it? I cannot tell you! Oh, yes! Take this. What is in this? - It is... - Ravi. Hello, uncle! - Hello, how are you, my child? I am fine! - I'll be back in a moment! Sit down, Ravi! Uncle, actually I have been sent here by my parents. Oh, I see! Uncle, all I have to say is that we give our consent for this proposal. And if you give your consent then I'll consider myself very fortunate. Ravi, we'll be fortunate to accept this proposal... and Seeta would get a husband like you! I'll write a letter to your father and fix the marriage date. Are you happy? Hey! Why are you crying? It's nothing! Aren't you happy? I am very happy, so happy that it scares me! Why should you get scared? Ravi, you have no idea who I am! I am... - I know one thing for sure! Whoever you are, you surely are a little crazy! Not much but little! Okay madam, I am free on Sunday and you are going out with me! But Ravi... - Yes or no? Ravi, you... - No? Seeta. Coming! Have you cooked the lentils? - Long back, mother! Give this, I'll clean it. - No, I'll do it! No mother, I'll do it! - Let me also do something. Raka. Why are you screaming, what is the matter? Are you coming to Pascal's den? - No, I am broke! Nobody gives me a loan. - Forget your state! I am loaded today, look I have 15 rupees. Speak softly, someone may pick your pocket! If anyone tries to do that I will kill that person! Aren't you my friend? Walk quietly! Raka. Yes, aunty! - So, you are going? I'm not going to have alcohol, this Raghu lives down the street... he has a wife and four children... so how can a family man go and have alcohol? I'm going to tell Pascal to stop giving him credit or liquor. Stop making such noises, shameless man! Are you mad? Everyone seems to be drinking, I'll go and fix everyone right! This is the only flaw he has, he has to drink everyday! "With a drink in my hands..." "goodness! There's so much to do" "With a drink in my hands..." "goodness! There's so much to do" "When I have the time, let's see what happens..." "I'll think about the world too" "With a drink in my hands..." "Why think of death, when I haven't even lived enough?" "Why must I worry about tomorrow?" "Why think of death, when I haven't even lived enough?" "Why must I worry about tomorrow?" "Who's scared of a night of sorrow...?" "the evening's so lovely" "The evening's so lovely" "I have so much to do" "When I have the time for it, I'll see what happens" "As for the world... aah! I'll think about it" "I was a bit tired..." "I added a bit of falsehood to the truth" "I was a bit tired..." "I added a bit of falsehood to the truth" "From the bottle, I took a swig..." "and I really find a bit of peace now" "Though I feel better..." "goodness! There's so much to do" "When I have the time, I'll see how things go" "About the world... aah! I'll think" Listen. - Who is it? It's you, at this hour?! Why aren't you sleeping? Go on, go to sleep! You come home first. Whose home should I go to? Your home! - I don't know where my home is! You know where my home is? - Yes, I know it! You know it?! - Yes, come with me! Okay, take me home!! Are you harassing me, do you really know where my house is? You are a very nice girl, you know where my house is! It's a problem finding it, where is it? Here is your house! Is this my house? Is this my house? Do you call this a house? Come inside with me and see my house! Do you call these four walls and a roof, a house? Is this bed, chair or this window my house? A home is made with a family and I don't have anyone in this world! No parents nor siblings, I don't have anyone! I was born on the footpath and raised up on the streets... then someday, I will die in this closed room! And then, the municipality van will come here... and will take me away! That will be the end of the story! What are you doing? - Who says that you have nobody? Raka, can't you ever give up on alcohol? If I don't drink then how will I live? But what difference does it make to you? What if it does make a difference? Chief, I have come to you! I know I've come late but I couldn't help it, I was side tracked! Last night, Geeta told me that I should stop drinking... and I should start working. When I heard her, I had tears in my eyes! At that moment I decided that I would come to you in the morning... and say that I am sorry for whatever wrong that I've done till date! From today, I will never touch alcohol! Even if Pascal gives it to me free, I will not have it! Chief, you are the supreme being... please forgive me! God, give Raka the strength to fulfill his promise! No child, this medicine is very bitter. Stop it, grandmother! It's little. Hold your nose and drink it, the doctor said... if you have this medicine, you'll become perfectly alright! One..two..three...five!! When you were small, I was your grandmother... but now I feel that you've become my grandmother! No grandmother, she has become a don! You imp! You've started talking a lot! Okay listen, Mr. Gupta has come! Oh, the lawyer! That poor man is not aware of anything. The money he gives you, is taken away from you, after he leaves! Mr. Badrinath, I am glad that this alliance has been fixed. Even we are very happy! - But where is Seeta? Here I am! Come, dear. Come child, we were talking about you! Oh, I see! - Child, how are you? I am fine, how are you? I am fine. Mr. Badrinath, I can see a change in her. She's got self confidence! She's changed a lot! - Yes! It's not only me, by the grace of God, something has happened... due to which all the family members have changed quite a bit! Isn't it, aunty? Wow! She has started talking a lot! Formerly, she used to sit quietly. Now I feel that you aunt is taking care of you! No, first she took care of me and now I take care of her! After all, even I have certain duties, isn't it, aunty? That's right! Alright then let me also fulfill my duty. This is your monthly allowance. - Thank you very much! Please count them. - Mr. Gupta, why do you always insist? Give your uncle.. Why, is his counting more superior than Mr. Gupta's honesty? Mr. Gupta, there is no need to count them. But yet if... - No... I don't want to insult you by counting this money! Child, since the past 20 years I have been coming in this house... for the first time, without counting... Many things are happening for the first time in this house these days! Isn't it, aunty? - Yes! Okay Mr. Badrinath, I'll take your leave now. You are leaving? - Yes, I'll leave now. Good bye! Good bye! - Good bye! May God bless you. - Let me drop you to the door. Aunty! Child, I was suggesting that you... What were you suggesting? - May I keep this money in the safe? You'll keep it in the safe? Here, keep it! I'll be back in a moment! It's very heavy, your delicate waist cannot take the burden of these keys. Never mind, I'll keep them with me! Yes, you can keep it! Seeta, my child... Seeta, my child... Get away! Is the food ready? - Not yet... It should be ready by 1 p.m., get that? Go now!! Kaushalya, I can smell something burning. My heart it burning. That means you are cooking non vegetarian food. You like to rub salt over my wounds, move away! That terrible girl made me a cook and you could not say a word! It's the law of nature, the powerful one rules the roost! Let her do as she pleases, let my brother come back... he'll fix her right! I hope your brother does not get thrashed in bargain! Nonsense! Ranjit is my brother! That means now he'll show his true colors? He will... - Aunty! Coming, child! I've made all your favorite dishes today. I have made ladyfingers, green vegetables... and you'll be very pleased to eat fried bitter gourd! Please sit and eat! Kaushalya, the kid played a prank on you! She is very naughty, she keeps fooling around! Just like you! - Naughty girl! You will not sit here, sit there! - But I always sit here. Now, the mistress of this house will sit here! Did you get that? Come on, move! You can sit here if you wish, I can sit anywhere... the idea is to eat... - Wait! I'll be back right away! Where has this stupid gone? - Wait, I'll set her right! They all are waiting for you! Child, how can I eat with them? No, they will eat with you! From today, grandmother will sit in this place. Did you understand? - Yes, child! And from today, she'll have all the keys to this house! Did you understand this too? - Yes! Hold these keys, - Me? you are the mistress of this house! Hold these keys! What are you watching, come on, start eating! Then what happened? That fatso acted as if it didn't effect her! She said that I am a very naughty girl! That you are! How much sugar? Is this sugar? Why do they make blocks of sugar? They are not blocks of sugar, they are called sugar cubes! What? Cub? Cubes. Cub. Forget it, keep it aside! - Why are you getting annoyed? Hello, Dr. Ravi. Hello. How are you? Fine. How are you? - Fine, thank you! Like to have some coffee? No, thank you. How is your knee now? - It had become fine but... Has it started hurting again? - Yes! Let me check. Sorry. Do you apply the ointment everyday? - Yes, I do! Do one thing, come to the clinic tomorrow, we'll take a X-ray. Okay. - Go. Thank you. Bye. - Bye. Hey! Listen. "There's this girl I saw in my dreams last night..." "she had a beautiful face and a lovely name" "And I met this boy in my dream last night" "He was so handsome to look at and he had a nice name too" "Had I seen the woman who was my bloody rival..." "I'd have killed her, I swear" "Had I seen the lover you dreamed about..." "I'd have ended my life, I swear" "Why're you sulking again? - Because you're sulking!" "You are the one I met in my dreams last night" "And you are the one I met in my dreams too" "You and I needed to see each other very badly" "You and I sure needed to see each other very badly" "So many times we met on moonlit nights..." "we said so many loving things to each other" "All night, we were awake. I gazed into his eyes..." "we promised so much love to each other" "You're a liar! - You're the liar!" "There was this boy... - There was this girl..." "a lovely meeting I had with the beloved in my dreams last night" "What a face.. what a nice name" Hello! - May God bless you, son! How are you? - Fine, thank you! Do you know my brother? - Yes. Seeing you after long, Ranjit. Yes, I had been to Delhi for business purpose. He has a vast import export business! By God's grace he has everything, all that he lacks is a house! That is why the poor man lives with his sister! You've started talking a lot. Ravi, what is father's brother called? Uncle. - And uncle's wife? Aunty! And aunty's brother? He's called a chuchu'. Ravi, you talk to 'chuchu', I'll be back! Listen, I am going. - Why are you going so soon? Yes, I have some work. Good bye! Bye. - Bye. Aunty, you talk to him, I'm going! Did you see that? - You keep quiet, sister! It's your fault, you must have left her loose. I went out for few days and this girl has forgotten her limits? You don't know what all she did after you left. She also doesn't know what I can do! You don't interfere, I will go and skin her hide! You wait here! You have lost your mind! You need a lot of overhauling! By threatening Sheila and sister you think you are very smart? Don't you recognize this? This has given you many injuries even before! From now on, you will behave as you used to! You will cook and wash the vessels... you will clean the house, get it? And you will sit and rule on me? No, Seeta! - Stop chanting my name! I will skin your hide and stuff you up! Seeta. Grandmother, please save me!! Coward, you're pleading to the one whom you never sympathized with! No Seeta, won't you listen to me? Grandmother?! - Go up to your room! If you have some shame left in you then wear my bangles! What are you doing, this is not an ox's back! But she whipped you thinking you are an ox! Damn that girl, she has whipped you up like cream! Mother, take this. - Got it, have you heated it well? I'll put this turmeric paste on you & very soon you'll become fine! Grandmother, what are you doing? Geeta. What? - I am reading the Bhagvad Gita. Come and listen to what Lord Krishna tells his devotees. What does he say? He says whenever there will be a rise of evil in this world... he will come to slay the evil! - Has he ever come to fight the evil? My child, every human being who fights evil and injustice... is a reincarnation of God! Grandmother, what if one has to resort to a lie to fight injustice... then is that too a sin? Lord Krishna says... that if one has to resort to a lie for a good cause... then that one lie is equivalent to many truths! Sir! - Where were you, you old man? Why does it take you two hours to buy a pack of cigarettes? What are you seeing now, give me a light! You oaf! Can't you even light one cigarette? Get lost! Ramu is very much older than you... almost like your father! Apologize to him! Ranjit, apologize to him. Ramukaka, wait here. Didn't you hear me Ranjit, apologize to Ramukaka! Come on! Forgive me. - Not like this! Bow down before him! Come on, do it! Ramukaka, please forgive me! Ranjit. Wait! Which brand of cigarettes do you smoke? Oh, it's 555! And what do you contribute towards this house? Nothing! If you eat in this house without working then I'll whip you 555 times! Ramukaka, Ranjit will go to the market to get the groceries! This is fresh? Sir, everything is fresh! - How much is this spinach for? You're only asking the price, are you buying for the first time? Why are you getting annoyed, are you giving it for free? What is this? - Aubergine! Do aubergines look like this? Okay, what is the price? Rs. 2 per kilo. - Okay, give me a kilo. Where had you been? - Oh, it's you? What is the matter, why do you look so scared? Nothing! - Tell me clearly, what is the matter? I am scared! - About what? I am scared that someone may separate you from me! Who can dare to do that? Don't you trust me? I do but I don't trust my fate! You fool, one can change the fate in a jiffy! You wait here, I'll be back in a moment. Where are you going? - To go and join your and my destiny! Can I go? Sister, it's a very auspicious date. You should fix up the marriage on the 18th of this month! Alright! - Priest, 18th is very far. Can't you make it earlier? - No son, it has to be on the 18th! Alright then! 18th?! Yes, Ravi's parents have decided the date. And I gave my consent. - But, uncle... Child, don't forget that we are from the bride's side... if we dillydally then they may misunderstand us! Besides, it's very rare to find boys like Ravi in this age! Okay, I will go to the jewelers and get your ornaments. Uncle... - Yes, child. Nothing! - May you always be happy! I have no right to call you my parents... I have hidden the fact that I am not your daughter and the only... reason for it was, to wipe the injustice prevailing here! But what shall I do now? These people, who consider me as your daughter, Seeta... want me to marry Ravi! They don't know that I'm not Seeta, who belongs to an affluent family. I am just an ordinary gypsy girl Geeta, who performs on the streets! Please tell me what I should do? Whose picture is this? This is Mr. Badrinath's niece, Seeta! - That's what even I thought... but she's Seeta's look alike, a gypsy girl called Geeta! Then where is Seeta? You have to find her, wherever she may be, you have to get her here! But before the 18th of this month! Watch out, uncle. If I could watch then why would I fall? I am sorry, here is your stick! Child, my car must be somewhere around, please take me there... Come on, I'll take you there. Sit down quietly or else... Child, you aren't yet ready? The wedding procession must be on it's way. Uncle, I... - I understand, child. If your parent's were alive, your mother would dress you up as a bride! And brother would send you away to your husband's house! But what can I do child, I am feeling very lonely! Okay child, I am going, you get dressed. I am very lucky to have you in my life! I have a wife who is beautiful, cultured & from a decent family. Marrying you... - Ravi. What is the matter? - Ravi, I... What is the matter? We are starting a new life from today. I don't want to hide anything from you! I am not what you've been thinking! - What do you mean? I don't belong to any affluent family. I am just an ordinary gypsy girl... whom these people have mistook as Seeta and got home! What are you saying? - Yes Ravi, I am Geeta! My work is to perform dances on the street. This cannot be true! If it is then why didn't you tell me before? I tried to tell you many times but you... You have deceived me! - Ravi, please listen to me! You think that I will accept a street performer... who has no idea about her lineage, as my wife? But we are married! - Shut up! Aunty, I went to the temple, she is not there! She told me she's going to the temple. -What happened, Cheena? Geeta had gone to the temple 2 hours back but she's not traceable now! It's our wedding today and where did she go? I'll tell you! "Oh yes..." "I'm drunk" "Oh yes..." "I'm drunk" "Not a little... I've had more than I can remember" "Oh yes..." "Oh yes..." "Oh yes..." "I'm drunk" "Not a little... I've had more than I can remember" "Oh yes..." "I'm drunk" "Please do forgive my misdemeanor" "I can't help it... my crazy heart isn't in my control" "Stay away from me... do not come closer" "Oh yes, undoubtedly..." "what I've had is surely evil" "Oh yes..." "Oh yes..." "Oh yes..." "Oh yes..." "I'm drunk" "See the liquor in my hands?" "But no one will notice my shattered heart" "Did anyone ask me what poison I've had?" "Oh yes, undoubtedly..." "I say it cheerfully... I'm quite drunk" "Yes, I'm drunk on liquor" "Oh yes..." Why did you do this, Seeta? Grandmother, I cannot get married! Seeta? Mr. Badrinath, did you call us here to humiliate us? If she did not want to get married then why did you put up this act? I'll tell you why she put up this act? She did it because, she is a very greedy person! She did it because, she was eying the wealth of this family! She eyed the property of this family! What nonsense are you saying? - I am stating the facts! This girl, whom you'll consider as Seeta... she is a look alike of Seeta and a street performer, Geeta! This is a lie! - This is the truth! For you as well as me! - Who are you? Ask her who am I! Tell them who I am or is it that you don't recognize me? You promised to marry me and... - No, this is not true! I did not make any promise! Ravi, don't believe his words, this is a lie! Is it a lie that your name is Geeta? Is it a lie that you a girl who performs on the streets? Child, where did you go away? I was very worried about you, why did you go away from home? Tell me, Geeta. She's not your daughter, she's our child, Seeta! You think I am blind that I will not recognize my own daughter? I think you have misunderstood! - No, I have not! Child, tell them all that I am your mother! Hey! Why are you quiet? Why don't you speak? Oh, my! I hope they have not done some black magic on you! Geeta, tell them that I am your mother! Have you forgotten me? Geeta, speak up!! Mother! Mother, please don't cry! I am your Geeta! Then where is my Seeta? Perhaps, she has abducted Seeta and has hidden her somewhere. Or perhaps, she must have killed Seeta. You rogue, scoundrel!! Wait! Is it true that your name is Geeta? - Yes! And even this is true that you've been staying here as Seeta? Yes! In that case I will have to arrest you for committing deceit and fraud! Come on! Wait! Please don't take her, she is not as you think! Please leave her! Inspector! Someone please... So the person whom we thought was Geeta, was actually Seeta? The person who loved me was Seeta?! Yes and that is why, everyone misunderstood Geeta! Now the police has taken her! You don't worry, wherever Geeta is... I will surely get her back! Did you see properly? Are you sure It is the 2nd room on the 1st floor? I am sure, I've just been released from there this evening! Alright, you go! Geeta! Raka, you?! Raka. Take it easy. Doctor, without asking questions, bandage this girl! Alright!...Oh, you?! How come you are here? - These people have imprisoned me! Seeta. Yes. You?! Idiots, didn't you find any other doctor besides him? Ranjit, I have understood all your moves! I will... There is no need to get angry, doctor. Just do your work or my friends will take you to task! Kirti. - Yes. Wear this bridal attire and come down quickly! And as soon as finishes his work, lock him up in the next room! Raka, I don't understand why you... - Geeta, please forgive me! I did not know the truth in fact, even you are not aware of the truth! What do you mean? - Seeta is your twin sister! My twin sister?! Who told you this? Aunty told me that... - But where is Seeta? I know it! - Where is she? Ranjit has locked her up in Plaza Cottage! Plaza Cottage! Come on! - There are Ranjit's men all around. So what, I can fight any monster to save my sister! How long will it take? - Few minutes more! Damodar, where did you get this old hag from? Nonsense. O God, what shall I do now? Don't worry Seeta, God has sent me here to protect you! Who are you? Don't look so surprised Seeta, I am not a stranger... I am your twin sister, Geeta! My twin sister?! But... - I will explain everything to you. But before that, I need to explain few things to the scoundrels... who have put you in this state! Ranjit wants to forcibly marry me! - He cannot even touch you! Seeta, trust me and quietly do as I say! Why are you delaying so much, how long will it take? Everything is ready, you call for the bride. Go and get Seeta, you start! - Okay. Hurry up! Come down quickly! - Please have mercy on me! I can't have mercy on anyone, come on! Where are you taking me? - Come on! How did you come here? Let's go! What joke is this? - Idiot! A lioness cannot marry a wolf! What did you say? I'll fix you right away! You?! - Yes, it's me! Then where is Seeta? - Seeta is here! Hey! You are here?! - Yes, I am here! Get them!! Come on. Wait a minute! Give that to me! Let me check you! Breathe heavily! You blockhead! You have asthma and you want to fight, sit down! Hey, shorty! What's your problem? - I am constipated, doctor! Lift your shirt...now you can go! Thank you, doctor. Good. Don't you'll have any problem? - Shut up! Come along with us! Go, get her! Take them all and tie them up! Take them quickly! Very good, my brave men! Geeta. Now you'll know who is a lion and who is a wolf! Hey! Tell your men that the king of lions has come! What are you seeing, go get him! Come, let me bash you up!! Take this now! Cheena. You are back again? Are you fine now? - Yes, sir! Did you go? - Twice. Go once again, where is the bathroom? - This side! Don't worry Ranjit, I don't attack unarmed people. Take this! What are you seeing? If you have the guts then pick up the sword! Come on, pick it up! Doctor, I've never been scared of anything in till date. But I wonder why, I am very scared today! There is nothing to fear! Doctor, what does one do on the nuptial night? How would I know, it's my first marriage too! Oh, I see! - Why are you so surprised? It's really my first marriage! You go, don't worry! Alright, as God wills! - Just a minute! Good luck.
