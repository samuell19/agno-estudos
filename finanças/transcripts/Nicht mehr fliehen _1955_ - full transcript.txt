Scream! Scream! Don't get upset. It's not your problem. The calm. The calm. There is no need to get upset. Come! The place doesn't exist. The place doesn't exist. The place doesn't exist in reality. It can only be imagined or constructed. In the myth of the atomic bomb, the "Place Zero" is named. Or "Quota Zero". The landscape that symbolizes finality and senselessness is the desert. The scenery is absurd. Everything related to it, the point on which the tower stands, the time foreseen for the activation, as well as the great divine coincidence, is called "Zero", the camouflage name for the experiment. For everyone who has to deal with it, zero becomes the center of the universe. Time and space begin and end at zero. All life revolves around zero. Each individual thinks only of zero. And of the zero hour. Or rather, the microsecond zero. - Two thousand seven hundred. - One thousand three hundred. - Two thousand seven hundred. - One thousand three hundred. - Two thousand six hundred. - One thousand four hundred. - Two thousand six hundred. - One thousand four hundred. - Two thousand five hundred. - No. One thousand four hundred.

Put it somewhere. Put it on the ground! Quickly! Quickly! I'm sorry, madam! I'll get the room ready. I'm going to buy mattresses. I'm going to buy colorful mattresses. I'm going to... I... Was it all in the suitcase? Are all these clothes yours, madam? What else do you have in the suitcase? What else do you have in the suitcase? Sapphire. Hello! Nobody there? Shall I bring the luggage, madam? What a damaged road! Sapphire. What a damaged road! She's not bad. So what? That's nothing. Her name is Ines. She was nice to me. She's not bad. She was nice to me. That's nothing. Nothing is told us about Sisyphus in the underworld. Myths are made for the imagination to breathe life into them. One sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it, and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone, the shoulder bracing the clay-covered mass, the foot wedging it, the fresh start with arms outstretched, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted hands. At the very end of his long effort measured by skyless space and time without depth, the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down toward that lower world whence he will have to push it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the plain. It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself. I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end. That hour like a breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the hour of consciousness. Sapphire! Sapphire! I'm alone. I'm tired. I will rest in the sun. I will rest in the sun. Let's get my precious dress. The black narcissus. The huge evening dress made of silanol acetate. The huge evening dress made of silanol acetate. A dress with free shoulders. In wide movements the fullness of the skirt swings back. A distinctive collar frames the shoulders with the white top. That's it! What have you done there? That's it! What have you done there? We've arrived. The huge evening dress made of silanol acetate. A dress with free shoulders. In wide movements the fullness of the skirt swings back. A distinctive collar frames the shoulders with the white top. Shall I bring the luggage, madam? That's nothing. Nothing. That's nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. It is necessary to continue. It is necessary to accept. One shouldn't stop. One has to move on. Here's the suitcase. Sapphire. Nothing. Sapphire. Attention! To the right! Attention! To the left! You killed her? Yes. Your revolver? Yes. Your passport! And Sapphire? Where is she? She must sign out. She must sign out. 90 seconds left. 90 seconds left. Five. 80 seconds left. 80 seconds left.
