During the Bakumatsu, there was a man called the Battosai. He was feared by all. Western architecture and gas lamps? Get out of the way! Oh, I'm terribly sorry. No problem. No problem. Just watch where you're going from now on, Samurai boy. Boy? Kenshin, this way! You're going to get lost if you don't watch out. Don't get mad at him, Yahiko. Kenshin's just happy he got to ride the locomotive. It's as incredible as I thought it would be. Why do they do this? Traveling all the way to Yokohama just to look at stupid buildings. And on top of that they have to travel by locomotive. You're the one who was the most excited about the train. If you feel that way, you can pay me back for the train tickets! Yeah, well, anyway, don't you think all of these buildings look the same? Yes, I guess so. But Japan is changing, and that's good. Pretty impressive, wasn't it? What the hell are you talking about? That's just brute strength. What did you say? We're not monkeys. We can use tools. Don't go over there. It's dangerous. Stop that right now! You're making trouble for everyone! We came to this country to create a little goodwill, but mostly we just want to get friendly with some of the ladies. How about it? Nippon, Shogun, Mount Fuji, Geisha. You wanna get it on? Please don't. Let's have some fun. Let's get to know each other a little better, baby. Let me go! Do something about this. Why don't you? No! Stop this nonsense right now or you will get hurt. What's going on? Who the hell are you? This bastard wants to ruin our party. Toki, stand back. Yes. Hurry up, miss! Hey, don't go away mad! Hurry up, miss! Hey, don't go away mad! Just joking! Just joking! You'll understand it after I explain it to you. IF I explain it! Did he use his sword? I don't know. It happened so fast! He's good. That's what you get! Bastard! Hey, guys, let's take his head off! He's a powerful man. Yahiko, give me your bamboo sword! I want to help that man. He won't need it. If you think our customs do not apply to you because you are foreigners, you are wrong. Here! Anyone ever tell you that you talk too much? Bastard! Big mouth! Bastard! Big mouth! Hey, up here! Bring your weapons and come up here! Look out! More foreigners! Watch out! You shouldn't use firearms in a fight like this. Kenshin, where's Kenshin? Kenshin, did you cut him? Of course not. You know I can't slash anyone with this sword. Oh, right. Stop it right now! Kenshin, they might not like to see a guy with a sword here. You better run. Hey, Samurai, you better get out of here! Toki, best if you hide too. We will meet later. Let's go. Here, this way. We're not done with you, bastard! And I'm not done with you! What's going on over there? Noisy rats, why can't they let us have a little more fun? What's going on over there? Noisy rats, why can't they let us have a little more fun? Well, what shall I do now? I guess I'm caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. All right, I'll finish you off. Come on, big boy! Son of a bitch! What the hell is this? It's not my fault! Shut up, you! You wanna fight? See you later. Is your friend going to be all right? Sure, you don't have to worry about Sanosuke at all. You did a good job out there. No, I didn't do anything. You're too modest. So, why do you carry a sword with a reverse edge? You recognized it. Years ago, I swore I would never kill anyone, ever again. I see. The use of violence makes you sick when you think about it. Those who died during the Bakumatsu cannot see how the Meiji government is rotten to the core. If they could see it, they would shed tears of anguish. No, maybe they would laugh at the irony. The sky I saw then was so blue. The sky must be high and clear, right? Yes. Well, I cannot leave Toki alone. May I have your name? Kenshin, my name is Kenshin Himura. I am Takimi Shigure. Takimi Shigure? I hope we meet again. I would like that. What do you want? You're as gruff as always. Look who's talking. You didn't come to Yokohama to see the sights, did you? Let me give you some advice. Stay away from that man. Takimi Shigure, he's a very dangerous man. She's a beautiful woman, isn't she? She's so different from the way some girls are. Who do you mean by some girls? Did you happen to get her name? Of course. Good! Geez, you are both idiots! Good! Geez, you are both idiots! The daughter of a Samurai from what was the Aizu Clan, her name's Toki. Ms. Toki Takatsuki! Did you say the Aizu Clan? I bet she's had a rough life. I don't think that means the same thing to me. Aizu! What are you talking about? I just mean she's had a tough life. Aizu! What are you talking about? I just mean she's had a tough life. No, I think you mean she's had a hard life because she's so pretty. Yeah, maybe so. Takatsuki of the Aizu Clan... You fools! Boy, am I starving! You fools! Boy, am I starving! Okay! Yokohama is a city of foreigners, and foreigners eat beef. What kind of logic is that? It's the reason Sanosuke came to Yokohama with us, isn't it? Damn right. I see. But unlike the Akabeko, it's harder to scam free meals here. What am I going to do with you? Don't take it that way. I'll pay you back when we get home. Come on, Yahiko, you were going to ask her too. Hey, I'm staying out of this. Shut up! Attack! Kenshin! What's the matter? Are they dead? No, I think they're just unconscious. Out of the way! Whoa! Whoa! Baron Tamono! Kawai, report this to headquarters on the double. Yes, Sir. Sakashita, report to the nearest police station. Yes, Sir. First Troop, move forward. Advance now, but do not fire until I give the command. Go! Second Troop, circle the perimeter. Yes, Sir. All others, guard this place and protect the civilians. Yes, Sir. It is very dangerous here. Please stand back. He's cool! Form a double line! Perfect! Withdraw according to our plan. Do not let them escape! Pursue them! After them! Do not let them get away! Well, we certainly saw a lot of things today, didn't we? Yokohama's a pretty exciting place. Let's see... A steam train, Toki Takatsuki, and I paid for your beef meal. That soldier was really amazing. Do you want to be a soldier too? No, I don't want to join the military. You see... How can I explain this? Either way, you'd have to learn to ride a horse first. I will! But I hear each horse judges its rider. I hope you don't fall off. Right, Kenshin? Damn right. Shut up. Damn right. Shut up. Let's go home. Sure, I guess so. Thank you, teacher! Thank you! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye, be careful. Yes, Ma'am! Are the children gone? Yes. Gentatsu has been gone for fourteen years, hasn't he? Yes, he died when I was four years old. I have been living here ever since. Time has gone by so quickly. What were you thinking about so seriously, Shigure? Oh, it was nothing. Hey, Shigure, are you home? There you are. Kajiki... There you are. Kajiki... What is the matter? Shigure, all went according to plan. The schedule of the English guest has changed. He will arrive in Tokyo in six days. I have also arranged for another cannon. That is encouraging. Shigure, I want you to take command of the final assault. Yes, I understand. We cannot turn back now, for Gentatsu's sake. I will never forget that night. It's me. I heard that the Satsuma and Choshu are making an alliance. Is it true, Gentatsu? Yes, I am positive. They are holding a secret meeting about it tonight. They will do anything to destroy the Tokugawa Shogunate. The attendees will be Takamori Saigo of the Satsuma and Choshu's Kogoro Katsura. Saigo and Katsura? Impressive meeting. Ryoma Sakamoto will serve as the intermediary at the meeting. All the leaders of the rebellion in one place on one night. If we can attack them, we can alter the flow of history. The Aizu Clan would save face. We could control the Shogunate. Shigure! Shigure! Well, where will they meet? We have narrowed it down to three different places. We considered Masuda-Ya, which the Satsuma use regularly. But the Shinsen Gumi are guarding that place, so it will not be there. The most likely places are Suzu-Ya, or the lumberyard of Minoda. Those are quite far from each other. That is why we cannot decide where to go. I think Suzu-Ya is the place. No, the Suzu-Ya has very few escape routes around it. They would never choose a dangerous location like that. He is right. Of course. I have decided on Minoda. We will regret it if we miss out on this opportunity. Yes! Right, let's go. What is wrong, Gentatsu? I cannot ignore my instincts. I am going to Suzu-Ya. Gentatsu... It is just a strong feeling. If I am wrong, I will come immediately to join you. I understand. If that is how you feel. Sakurai, Asami, and Yokata, take your groups with him. Yes, Sir. I am sorry. Damn! Gentatsu! Gentatsu! I am so sorry, Gentatsu. It was... it was... It was my mistake! Forgive me, Gentatsu! If we had followed Gentatsu's advice, he would not have died. If we had smashed the alliance, the Aizu Clan would not have suffered so much tragedy. The battle of Aizu, the atrocity of the Byakko-Tai, would have been avoided. All of it is my fault. All of those were caused by my lack of judgement. I feel the guilt of that decision every single day, every time my loved ones are in pain. But the day to avenge Gentatsu has finally come! I cannot live peacefully, or I will have no excuse to offer Gentatsu. I am leaving. Where are you going? You do not need to know. I will be late. Wait! Wait! Wait! Stay inside the gate! Yes, Ma'am! Sister Kaoru! What is it? There's a strange person looking around outside the dojo. Really! If it's another solicitor, I'm going to kick them right out! Oh, Ms. Toki. Welcome. Welcome! Good day to you. This is our practice hall. Right! I'll take you around to the front where we welcome our guests. Here you are. Please don't go to any trouble on my account. Is Mr. Himura in? Kenshin? Yes, I have something I need to discuss with him. Kenshin? Yes, I have something I need to discuss with him. Oh, man. She didn't come to see me. Kenshin always gets the most delicious parts. Kenshin is out buying tofu. Tofu? Grocery shopping is his chore. Well, take this then. You should all have this. Oh, my! That looks delicious! Oh, my! That looks delicious! But it's kind of a waste even if the fish is fresh... ...when the skill of the person who cooks it is lacking. What do you mean by that? I hate to put you to work, Ms. Toki. Oh, not at all. I love to cook. It looks delicious! Please eat as much as you want. Thanks for the meal! Incredible! It is really wonderful. This is so different from the meals we're used to eating around here. The difference is in the ingredients! Enhance the quality or kill it depending on the skill of the cook. You two don't get to eat tomorrow! I mean, it does depend on the quality of the ingredients. Isn't that right, Yahiko? Why can't you answer, Yahiko? It smells so good. Welcome home, Kenshin. Ms. Toki... Here is the tofu, Kaoru. Oh, sorry. We don't need it for tonight's dinner anymore. What? Speaking of that, Kenshin, Ms. Toki came to speak with you about something. Well, it is that... What is it? I must speak with you about Shigure. Mr. Shigure? What is your relation? He was an ally of my late elder brother during the Bakumatsu. Your late elder brother? Yes, he was my only family, so... Was your brother a... He was Gentatsu Takatsuki of the Aizu Clan. I thought so. He was one of the three great Kanuma swordsmen? Yes. I'm astonished by the two of you. How long will you turn your backs on each other? Mr. Katsura? Mr. Saigo? This is not good, not good. The Satsuma and Choshu Clans cannot go on like this. If they do, the dawning of a new era will never occur in Japan. Is it the Shinsen Gumi? Or the Shogunate guards? Protect Mr. Katsura and Mr. Saigo! We'll take care of them. Understood. We'll take care of them. Please! The Aizu Clan? Hitokiri Gentatsu! Where is Katsura? Bring me Saigo and Sakamoto! Gentatsu Takatsuki of the Aizu Clan, called Hitokiri Gentatsu. One of the best Kanuma swordsmen. He was incredible. Excuse me. Is something wrong? Nothing. Recently, Shigure has been acting strangely. He looks very sad, and seems to be thinking something serious. But after we returned from Yokohama, he spoke highly of you. Of me? He said, I am glad to find a man like him in times like these. And, I have finally met a true Samurai after all these years. I feel the same way about him. Please do me a favor. He will not open up to me. But if you spoke with him, Mr. Himura, he would tell you something. I feel so helpless lately! Ms. Toki... I hate to put you to the trouble of walking me home. It's no trouble. It's my duty as a gentleman. What a mansion! Please come in. Please excuse me. You're home, Toki. Good day, Sir. Yahiko walked me home. He lives with Mr. Himura. With Mr. Himura? Yes, Sir. You look like a fine young man. I am Yahiko Myojin of Tokyo, child of a former Samurai family! A Samurai family? Who was your father? He was a member of the Shogi-Tai, and died for his beliefs. The Shogi-Tai? I'm sure he was a greatly respected man, wasn't he? Yes, Sir. Feel free to ask me for any favor you may require. I would be glad to help you regardless of the effort involved. Thank you very much. Mr. Shigure! Musashino, good timing. This is Yahiko, a friend of Himura, of whom I have told you. It is a great coincidence, Musashino. Yahiko's father died as a member of the Shogi-Tai. I see. Musashino's father also died while a member of the Shogi-Tai. You have had a very hard life, haven't you? Not really. Let us continue to do our best. Okay. Yahiko, eat with us this evening. Take a relaxing bath as well. Think of this as your home. Yes, Sir! Gentatsu Takatsuki... You can't stop thinking about him. Shigure, I mean. Takimi Shigure... Hey, where are you going, Yahiko? You haven't finished practice yet. I'm going to visit Mr. Shigure. Again? He has a beautiful lady at his house. Hey! Jeez, what kind of attitude is that? May I? Your hip is unprepared for attack. Yes, Sir. Ouch. What was that? I'm not finished yet! Please return your writing brush. Yes, Ma'am. Mr. Himura! Thank you for listening to me the other day. A private school? Yes, but I am hoping to become a better teacher. Is Mr. Shigure in? Well, he has not come home since yesterday evening. I see. Could you give him a message for me, then? Ask him to meet me tomorrow at six. I will be at the Oohashi Bridge next to the shrine. Yes, I will tell him. Well, then. I am sorry he is not here. Army Minister Yamagata and Superintendent General Kawaji, I must offer my opinion to you. You may proceed, Tamono. Yes, Sir. You may not need my assistance in this matter, but I have been thinking about the recent attack in Yokohama. We should take into account their target was the English Consulate, and we should increase the guard along the parade route this week. This is your recommendation? There may be radical elements thriving in Tokyo. An assault on a foreign minister would bring shame upon Japan. I urge you to order reinforcements for the patrol during the parade. Furthermore, I think you should take personal command during the visit. Tamono's request is reasonable. Agreed. Tamono, you will assist me in the command the day of the parade. Yes, Sir! Hurry up! Do not be slow! We must finish the transport tonight. Kajiki, how is it going? Everything is fine. Excellent. Kajiki, let us go to the temple. We are ready now. Mr. Shigure, all of the crates have been secured. Good, thank you. Assemble! I thank you all. Our preparation is complete, now we take action. Each of you has someone to whom you must bid farewell. Tomorrow! Finish all your farewells by tomorrow. You are still awake? Yes. Would you like some dinner? Toki, would you join me for dinner? I am going to leave on a long journey. I will go to Kyoto and then Aizu. I will go with you! No, you must stay here and take care of our home. But... I will write to you. But... I will write to you. Delicious. May I have another bowl? Yes. It will be a long time before I eat another of your homemade meals. What's up? They've met frequently in the last few days. I wonder when they will take action? See you tomorrow. Oh, Yahiko? Yes? You must grow up to become a respectable man. Snow! We will now pray for our client's continued success! Tori no Ichi... We will now pray for our client's continued success! We will now pray for our client's continued success! I am sorry I'm late. We will now pray for our client's continued success! We will now pray for our client's continued success! It's no problem. This is good. I was hoping to see you again. Ms. Toki is worried about you. I'm wondering what's on your mind, Mr. Shigure? If something happens to me, take care of Toki. There's a fight! Did you learn anything about Shigure? Yes, he's a very dangerous man. What do you mean by that? Shigure is drawing people to him. Survivors and orphans of the Shogi-Tai. Survivors of the Battle of Aizu. Survivors of the Battle of Hakodate. All are people who have a grievance with the current government. Why him? He's popular, I guess. Popular? They say he visits the families of the men who died during the last battles against the Shogunate. He comforts them as well. And his comforting includes taking care of their financial problems. The rumor is that he is planning a rebellion. Some say it is his path to atonement. Atonement? The greatest threat is not Shigure. It is the men who surround him. Yahiko, you must grow up to become a respectable man. Respectable man? What did he mean? Respectable? What? Man? He wasn't talking about those two! Musashino? What's going on? Finally, the time has come for us to stand up! Our desires are ready to be realized! We have been branded as rebels, lost our comrades, been covered with disgrace. We have been treated as enemies by this new government! So as Aizu Clan! So as Shogi-Tai! Sanosuke! Kenshin... Why are you here? I heard some disturbing rumors about Shigure. I came to discover the truth for myself. Rich businessmen with political influence bribe the Meiji everyday. The government is totally rotten! Remember what our late friend Gentatsu Takatsuki once said, The sky must be immeasurably high and clear! And, All men must be equal under the blue sky! We must create that world! We will raise an army. The discontented will come to us from all over Japan! We will start another Restoration! The New Restoration! Who are you?! Bastard, how much did you hear? We cannot allow you to live now. Yahiko? You will die! Wait! Mr. Shigure, let me join you. What? Please! Please give me a chance to avenge my father's death. Please let me! Yahiko... Mr. Shigure, please accept him. I ask you for this favor. Musashino! Survivors of the Battle of Aizu? The Shogi-Tai? Yes, there seem to be a lot of them. Not good. Yes, there seem to be a lot of them. Not good. Hey, Kenshin! Hey, Kenshin! Mr. Himura! Mr. Himura, do you know... Do you know where Shigure is? He's not home? I wish I had found this sooner. It was hidden behind Gentatsu's memorial altar. May I see it? Yes. The time has come for me to keep my promise to Gentatsu. Farewell, I hope you have a happier future. If you need any help, please contact Mr. Himura. This is a... What are you doing here? Kaoru, where is Yahiko? Yahiko? Yahiko isn't at home, so I assumed he was here. If we're going to find Yahiko, we better find Shigure. They are on the move. But... What is their destination? The advance party is in place. I wish you all good luck on your portion of the event. Yahiko? Yes, Sir. What can I do for you? Yahiko, I am impressed with your spirit. Thank you very much, Sir. However... Mr. Shigure! Yahiko is just a child. If something were to happen to him, I do not know how I would ever be able to face Mr. Himura. Mr. Shigure... I am sorry, Yahiko. I will go on ahead, and make the final preparations. Of course, go. We must go too. Yes, Sir. You're late, Kajiki. Pardon my lateness, but our preparations are complete now. This removal of weapons from the army arsenal was hard to conceal. Thank you. Here is a map of the parade route with the guard postings marked. What about Shigure? He has no suspicions. He'll remain ignorant until the end. Yes, Sir. Did you find out his view on the points of attack? Yes, Sir. He refuses to risk the lives of any civilians during the attack. A person who believes such things and tries to remain pure has no place in this world. I don't really care anyway. I will take care of the guards. I appreciate that. And I managed to get Yamagata to take the command for the day. The death of a foreign minister in a place like this... Killed by the army's own weaponry no less! Yamagata will be thrown down from his position. And the next minister will be... You, Baron Tamono. The old man will be removed and my time will finally come. Just make sure that English bastard is killed! Yes, Baron Tamono. And when everything is done, I will be... You will be rewarded with a high government position. I want to ride the winning horse this time. Trust me. Where in the hell is he? We walked around all night. We looked everywhere and turned up nothing. Are you feeling okay, Ms. Toki? Yes. Yahiko... Ms. Toki! Yahiko! Yahiko? Yahiko! You brat, where have you been? We've been worried about you. What? How dare you be so selfish?! I've really been worried sick about you. We looked all over for you. I was going out of my mind worrying that you were hurt. Yahiko, I'm so relieved to see that you're alive. If she hadn't slapped you, I would have been glad to do it. I would have too, Yahiko. I'm so sorry. Where is Shigure? I don't know. This is very important. Where did he go? I really don't know. They left me behind. Come on, Yahiko, didn't you hear them talking about anything? I'm telling you... Please! Please tell them what you know. Anything you know! Just as Yahiko is important to Ms. Kaoru and Mr. Himura, Shigure is... Shigure is the most important person to me! Please, Yahiko! Yahiko, don't you remember anything? Yahiko? They talked about a guest of the nation or something. A guest of the nation? The British foreign minister is coming to Tokyo, isn't he? Today! Yes, I read that there was going to be a parade in his honor. A guest of the nation... Mr. Himura, please stop Shigure! Please! Please! Please... What a grand parade. This is the first time a foreign minister has visited Tokyo. All the more reason this day must end safely. If they are planning anything, this will surely be their target. Yes, Sir. Well, it looks like all has been successful. Enjoy your final moments as Minister of the Army. I will take advantage of your relaxation, thinking everything is over. Ready. Hurry up! Protect the foreign minister! Look at that smoke! It's from the guesthouse! Let's go! Charge! Get out of my way! I declare the beginning of the New Restoration! Shigure! Shigure! Shigure! Kill each other for all I care. I need another round! You won't need it. Where is the foreign minister? He is in there, isn't he? You must die! What?! Stop this at once. Don't interfere! Withdraw your men! Get out of my way, Himura! I will not. Then I will kill you first! The sakabato... I wanted to avoid fighting you most of all. As did I. That is irrelevant now! Stop this! You don't gain anything with this foolishness! Use your brains! Gentatsu! Where is Gentatsu? Gentatsu! Gentatsu! That was you! Saiki-Kanuma Swordsmanship! I will never forgive you! Take the foreign minister into the guesthouse immediately. Quickly! Fire! Fire! Musashino! Mr. Shigure... Please... Musashino! Hurry! Protect the perimeter! Don't let them escape! Mr. Shigure, please hurry. I will settle this one day, at any cost. What in the world? Yahiko? Musashino... Musashino! Musashino! Musashino! Musashino! This can't be! Musashino! Musashino! Hitokiri Gentatsu, we fought all those years ago for one reason. We wanted to make sure that no such battles ever took place again. I never wanted to feel this sadness again. Kenshin... Gentatsu, I will do everything in my power to stop that man. What's going on? These cannons belong to the army, don't they? Yes. Why does the rebel army have our cannons? Those idiots failed. The rebel army has barricaded themselves in the forest of Ueno. What did you say? Ueno? They are acting just like the Shogi-Tai, aren't they? They are surrounded and under constant surveillance. Minister! Minister, I can finish them off. Well, then. Wait a moment. Just who are you? Do you know who I am? I am Baron Tamono of the Imperial Guard, and that is Army Minister Yamagata. Tamono, let him approach. Minister Yamagata. Himura, we are in a very critical situation. If this is not an emergency, please let it wait until later. You must hold off your attack. What? I know the rebel leader. You're not saying you want to go in there alone, are you? That is utterly careless! It shames me to say this, but the rebels used army weaponry for their attack. The roots of this incident run very deep. Himura, that man is the cause of this carnage. We can't wait for long. That is fine. How can you ask me to wait? Minister, you must order me to launch a full attack! We will place our faith in Himura for now. If anyone can end this bloodlessly, it will be him. I trust you, Himura. Ms. Toki, please wait! Ms. Toki, calm down. I have to go with Shigure. Mr. Himura! Shigure... Shigure plans to die! He has always blamed himself for my brother's death. If he dies... Ms. Toki, I promise I will bring Mr. Shigure back to you. Don't worry. Kenshin will help you, okay? Oh, Kaoru! Kenshin? Kenshin, will you go in there alone? But... Ms. Toki's brother was killed during the Bakumatsu. I know that. The man who killed him was... The Hitokiri Battosai. It was I. Oh, no. That is the main reason Mr. Shigure caused this travesty. Therefore, I have to take responsibility for it as well. Oh, no... No! Kenshin... Hurry up! This barricade must be built on the double! If we don't hurry, the government forces will break in! Damn! Why should we lock ourselves in like this? Does Shigure want to be just like the Shogi-Tai? I don't care. When push comes to shove, I'll slip over to Tamono's side. I have too much information on Tamono's dealings. He would never betray me. You're late, Kenshin. They've cornered themselves behind those barricades. Now that they've settled in, they don't seem to want to move at all. I wonder if Shigure is laying in wait for you, Kenshin? Tamono? Let them through. Yes, Sir! I wonder if we'll ever see you again? That guy is such a jerk. Someone's coming! What?! A soldier? Let me handle this. It's very dangerous up there, so move it. What do you mean? Hey! I told you it was dangerous. Kenshin, they're just children. Hey, what are you doing? These are government spies! Kill them! Kill them both! I don't want to, but I'll take care of this, Kenshin. Thank you, Sano. You can count on me. All right, kids! Let's go! I'm going to teach you how to fight! Your leg position is too open. You leave your jaw too exposed. Don't just stand there. Kenshin, hurry up! I can't fight rifles at this short range. Very good! Now finish them off! Leave them alone. Shigure? He came to see me. Kenshin, I'll leave this one to you. Back up, everybody! This is going to be dangerous. You too! I knew you would come. We must settle this now. I have something to tell you. The one who killed Gentatsu... It was you, Hitokiri Battosai! I realized it during our last fight. If your anger towards me has caused you to do this... No, Gentatsu risked his life when he fought you, and you risked yours. In a duel, death is no one's fault. However, Himura, look at the hell society is living in because of the Meiji government. We all risked our lives back then. I risked mine along with you and Gentatsu. But now that the victors have control, they demand to be honored, use their power unwisely, and do nothing but covet money. They have disgraced the memories of those like Gentatsu who fought from pure motives. Can you forgive a government that acts in such a manner? I... Did you kill so many men in the service of a system like that? If you did, the people killed by your sword will rest uneasily, Hitokiri Battosai. Himura, we will start a New Restoration. Once again, we will define good and sort out the evil in our midst. That is the only way to serve the memories of those who died. To honor those who died so young. Do you want to atone for their loss by shedding more blood? Do you want to make a new world by trampling over more bodies? By making more people bleed?! That is the greatest betrayal of those who died in the war. It is your betrayal. I am a former Aizu Samurai. I use Saiki Kanuma technique. I am Shigure Takimi. Ready! I use Hiten Mitsurugi technique. I am Kenshin Himura. Kenshin... During the Bakumatsu, Saiki Kanuma technique was used for indoor fights. How will it work here? How will he attack? Kanuma Erasing Moon Slash. Don't let the sheath distract you. Will he attack from the left? Or the right? Or from above? Or below? Kenshin... He's coming. From below! Hiten Mitsurugi Dragon's Hammer Flash! I predicted your sword's movement. The line of your attack. I will never forget it. Hiten Mitsurugi Flying Dragon Flash! A swift stroke and then a pause. I know it all too well. It was seared into my memory and has haunted me for fourteen years. Kanuma Erasing Sun Slash! Iron sheath! Kenshin! Erasing Sun Slash! I see, a double attack within a circle. But... I am better than Gentatsu. Kenshin! Everything will be all right. Kenshin can handle this situation. Mr. Shigure will be all right. Right, Ms. Toki? Ms. Toki?! I can barely move my arm. Himura, if you do not use the blade of your sword, you will die tonight. Now, turn your sword over. I don't mind shedding my own blood, no matter how much flows. However, I won't let you make others bleed! Then you will die here! I only need one attack, just one. His posture is of Hiten Mitsurugi's Flying Sky Dragon Flash. Kanuma Erasing Flame Slash! He flies? That's the same attack as before. It will be useless to you! That's not it. It's not the Dragon's Hammer Flash, or the Flying Dragon Slash. What is it? There's no stable foothold in the air. Kanuma Double Head Slash! He used the force of his turning body to draw his sword. Incredible. That was incredible. It's Kenshin's original sword-drawing technique. Why didn't you cut me? In honor of the men I killed, I vowed to never use my sword to kill anyone ever again. That's how I atone for them. Gentatsu... Shigure, I love the blue sky over Mount Bandai. I do too. The blue sky must be high and clear no matter how far away it is. The whole world should be like that. Gentatsu... For your sake, Gentatsu, I won't lose this battle. Let's go. Stop! Stop! Stop it! Toki? You... You have had enough. Please stop this now. Toki... Gentatsu... Would Gentatsu want to see Ms. Toki crying like this? What's the matter, Gentatsu? I can't sleep at night. The men I've killed have mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers. They have people they love. I keep thinking about that. Gentatsu... I know. What did the letter from your family say, Shigure? My father has fallen ill again. His symptoms have returned, but I can't worry about him now. With the Choshu Clan on the move... You're wrong, Shigure. With the Choshu Clan on the move... You're wrong, Shigure. Toki is all I have left. That is probably why I feel this way. But you cannot be ashamed of loving your family. If you do not love your family, you have no qualifications to care about your country or the world. Do you know why I use my sword despite being called Hitokiri? It is because of my friends, the memory of my family, and for Toki. I want the people I love to be happy. Gentatsu... Gentatsu... Gentatsu! There is a man who honors your death more than I. I... I have lost. The man behind the uprising is Baron Tamono. What are you saying? This one confessed everything. Who is he? He works in the arms depot. The rebels used weapons that were given to them by Tamono. My god! He also told us who Tamono's contact in the rebel army is. I will report this to the minister at once. Mr. Shigure! Are you okay, Mr. Shigure? I'm fine. Don't make such a fuss. Mr. Shigure! Mr. Shigure! Mr. Shigure! Mr. Shigure! Mr. Shigure! Toki, please come here. Yes. Toki, I will turn myself in to the authorities. Yes. Toki, I have been making you cry all this time, haven't I? Will you survive with that wound, Kenshin? Yes. Watching them, this wound... Forgot about the pain? You would. Aim well! Fire! Fire! What the hell is this? Is Kenshin still in there? Kenshin... Shigure! Shigure! Mr. Shigure! Mr. Shigure! Shigure! Toki, are you there? I am. I am right here. Gentatsu, the blue sky has to be high and clear, no matter how far away it is. Shigure? Shigure! The next volley will kill the rest of them. Who would have guessed that I would conspire with Kajiki, the poor bastard? Why? Why did you fire at them?! Idiot. You all are going to die now. You! Fire! Kill them all! Damn! Everyone hide behind something! Anything! Kenshin! He's escaping! Shoot him! What?! What are you doing? Hurry up and shoot him! Kenshin! Kenshin! Hold your fire! The battle is over. Put your guns down! Remove the injured by stretcher. Bring in medical supplies. Arrest Tamono! Listen, you guys, you're lucky to be alive, aren't you? Tamono has betrayed me. You are the traitor, though. You threw over your best friend to gain influence with your enemy. You live your life by testing the wind and going in its direction. I might be wrong. Maybe you are just flexible. What did you say?! I am waiting. I chose the place you will die, so draw your sword as you will. Wait a minute! I know everything that happened. I can testify against Tamono. Why don't we make a deal? I will not be killed by a corrupt man who stands for false justice! I never told you my definition of justice. It is to kill evil immediately. Shinsen Gumi, Hajime Saito... May we move him? A little longer. Let me stay with him a little longer, please. Yes, Ma'am. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Be careful out there. Be careful out there. Yes, Sir! Mr. Himura? What can I do for you? I must tell you something, Ms. Toki. The man who killed Gentatsu was I. During the Bakumatsu, I was known as the Hitokiri Battosai. Did Shigure know this? I see. Shigure told me that the Bakumatsu was incredibly chaotic. Nobody could tell good from evil. He said that people fought solely for what was in their hearts. I believe what he said. I am going to travel to Shigure's hometown to bury his belongings. Thank you for everything. Take care, Ms. Toki. I hope you come back soon. I will. The children will be waiting. At your private school? Yes, and someday I want to teach this story to my students. They should know how people felt during the Bakumatsu. They might grow up to create the world Shigure dreamed of. One in which no blood is shed. I hope you'll visit his grave soon. I most definitely will. When the flowers are in bloom, let's all visit his grave together. Yeah! Good idea! Be careful! The blue sky should be high and clear no matter how far away it is. Isn't that right?
