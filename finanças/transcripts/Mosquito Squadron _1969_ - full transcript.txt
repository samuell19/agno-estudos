DOG ONE, YOU'RE LEADER NOW, QUINT. DOG ONE, DO YOU READ ME, DOG ONE? SIR, THEY'RE CALLING YOU. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR? DOG ONE TO HOUNDS. FOLLOW ME. WE'RE GOING OUT LOW AND FAST. STAND EASY. THE STRIKE REPORT YOU RADIOED AHEAD WAS RELAYED TO COMMAND. YOU'LL NO DOUBT BE PLEASED WITH THE SIGNAL I'VE JUST RECEIVED FROM THE AIR MARSHAL. "PLEASE CONVEY MY PERSONAL REGARDS "TO FLYING OFFICERS AND MEN OF 641 SQUADRON. WELL DONE." WE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE A DENT. WELL, THEIR LAUNCHING SITES ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT UNTIL THEY GO INTO OPERATION, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU, THAT COMMAND IS GIVING THE V-1 PROBLEM THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. YES, SIR. WELL, THAT'S ALL. I'M SORRY ABOUT SQUADRON LEADER SCOTT. WHAT HAPPENED? A FLIGHT OF MESSERSCHMITTS JUMPED US. HE WAS HIT BEFORE HE COULD MANEUVER. WENT DOWN IN FLAMES. NO PARACHUTES? NO, SIR. WHAT DOES ONE SAY? YOU WERE CLOSE, WEREN'T YOU? WE WERE BROUGHT UP TOGETHER. REALLY? WERE THERE FAMILY CONNECTIONS? NO, MY MOTHER AND FATHER WERE KILLED SOME TIME AGO. I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF SQUADRON LEADER SCOTT'S PARENTS AS MY OWN. I SEE. WELL, I SUPPOSE I'D BETTER GO AND TELL THEM. IT'S A HATEFUL BUSINESS. I CAN NEVER FIND THE WORDS. WHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE? WOULD YOU, I--I--I MEAN... ALL RIGHT. HELLO, QUINT. HI, QUINT. HELLO, QUINT. WHAT DID YOU SAY TO MY SISTER? I DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING. SCOTTY? YOU STILL AT THE HOSPITAL? YES, CONVALESCENT. I BROUGHT THIS CROWD OVER. I WISH TO GOD I HADN'T. WHEN DO YOU RETURN TO DUTY? DUTY? WHAT DUTY? PLYING A DESK ONE-HANDED? IF THAT'S ALL YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE. WELL, THEY'VE OFFERED ME A HOOK. MAKES A MARVELOUS BACKSCRATCHER, SO I'M TOLD. WELL, I'M SURE SCOTTY WOULD SETTLE FOR IT RIGHT NOW. HE'S DEAD. DID YOU SEE IT? YES. NO PARACHUTES? THERE WASN'T TIME. DID... DID IT BURN? IT BLEW UP WHEN IT HIT THE GROUND. BETH. LEAVE ME ALONE. PLEASE. ♪ HOW DID SHE TAKE IT? DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GO TO HER? NO, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD GO TO HER. JUST LET HER CRY. YOU'RE A HARD-NOSED BASTARD, QUINT. SCOTTY WAS PRACTICALLY YOUR BROTHER. THAT'S RIGHT, DOUGLAS. SCOTTY WAS PRACTICALLY MY BROTHER. AH, MUNROE, MEET MAJ. KEMBLE, MILITARY INTELLIGENCE. MAJOR'S GOT A LITTLE JOB. I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE MAN FOR IT. HOW DO YOU DO? SIR. NOTHING VERY EXCITING, I'M AFRAID. MILK RUN, REALLY. WANT TO GO OVER. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PLACE. CHATEAU DE CHARLON. VERY PRETTY. YES. WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN IS THE, UH, UNDERSKIRTS. YOU'VE BEEN BRIEFED ON THE V-2 ROCKETS THAT ARE JUST STARTING TO HIT US? YES, SIR. WELL, INTELLIGENCE HAS IT THAT THERE'S A V-3, EVEN A V-4 IN DEVELOPMENT. LARGER, MORE PUNCH, MORE IMPORTANT, LONGER RANGE. WE THINK THE DEVELOPMENT WORK IS BEING DONE HERE AT CHATEAU DE CHARLON. THAT'S WHY, I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK. THE MAJOR WILL BE FLYING WITH YOU. I UNDERSTOOD I HAD A FEW HOURS OFF BASE, SIR? WELL, THE WEATHER'S CLOSED IN OVER FRANCE. IT WOULD TAKE SOME HOURS TO FIT THE CAMERAS TO YOUR AIRCRAFT. 24 HOURS BE ENOUGH FOR YOU? OH, YES, SIR. I'M GOING TO SEE MY, UH, SQUADRON LEADER SCOTT'S PARENTS. WHAT TIME IS IT? HALF PAST 4:00. THEY'LL JUST BE HAVING TEA ON THE TERRACE. COME ON. WALK WITH ME QUINT, WILL YOU? WE WERE PULLING OUT, YOU KNOW, READY TO GO HOME, WHEN A FLIGHT OF MESSERSCHMITTS JUMPED US. I THINK THEY CAME OUT OF THE SUN. IT WAS SO QUICK, SCOTTY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO MANEUVER. HE JUST APPEARED TO GO STRAIGHT DOWN, INTO THE GROUND. THERE WAS... HE HAD NO TIME, NO TIME AT ALL, TO PULL OUT. I'M SURE THAT, AH, IT WAS INSTANTANEOUS. WHEN YOUR PARENTS DIED, AND YOU CAME TO LIVE WITH US, MOTHER AND I ALWAYS ADMIRED YOUR SPIRIT, THE WAY YOU HANDLED YOUR GRIEF, AND, WENT ON WITH YOUR LIFE. THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE WANTED ME TO DO. I, UM... I ONLY HOPE WE CAN DO AS WELL, QUINT. YOU'LL BE LEADING THE SQUADRON NOW? YES. GOOD. MOTHER AND I WILL BE PROUD OF YOU. THERE'S CHARLON. HOW CLOSE DO YOU WANT TO GO? PART THEIR HAIR, SQUADRON LEADER. NOISY LOT, WEREN'T THEY? THAT'S A LOT OF FLAK FOR ONE CHATEAU. THEY MUST HAVE SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT SEEN. WHICH IS A GOOD REASON FOR US TO HAVE TO GO IN AGAIN. HOW CLOSE DO YOU WANT TO GO THIS TIME? KNOCK THEIR BLOODY HEADS OFF. YOU HAD ENOUGH YET? YOU OK, MAJOR? LET'S GO HOME. MORE TROUBLE, I'M AFRAID. I THINK THEY GOT THE HYDRAULICS. IT OUGHT TO BE A BUMPY LANDING. MAJOR! MAJOR! COME ON, SMARTLY NOW. KEMBLE? HE'S IN THERE. SMASH THE COCKPIT. SMASH THE COCKPIT. I JUST HOPE THOSE BLOODY PICTURES ARE WORTH IT. AWAY YOU GO. THAT'S THE SQUADRON LEADER'S READY ROOM. THROUGH THERE, MA'AM. I--I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE. THANK YOU. OH, IT'S YOU. I... I CAME FOR SCOTTY'S THINGS. OH, I--I WAS GONNA BRING THEM OVER. I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST WANTED TO SEE THIS PLACE. I FORGOT THAT YOU-- OH, NO, NO. THAT'S, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I, UM... I SAW SCOTTY'S BATMAN ON THE WAY OVER. HE WAS GOING TO FETCH A UNIFORM OF SCOTTY'S. IT WAS AT THE CLEANERS. HOW'S DOUGLAS? OH, HE'S GONE BACK TO THE HOSPITAL TO GET ONE OF THOSE ARTIFICIAL HANDS FITTED. HE SAID YOU CONVINCED HIM. I DID? YOU JOLTED HIM, QUINT. OH. THAT'S WHAT HE NEEDED. YES. YOU LOOK TIRED. HAVE YOU BEEN FLYING? YES, JUST ROUTINE. IT WAS A MILK RUN, REALLY. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, YOU'RE RESTING. I'LL COME BACK WHEN-- NO, NO, NO. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THERE'S, UH, SOME MORE STUFF IN THERE. SCOTTY CALLED THIS ROOM HIS CONFESSIONAL. A PLACE WHERE HE FACED UP TO HIMSELF. HE ENVIED YOU, QUINT. HE ENVIED ME? WELL, HE HAD ALL THE BRAIN. I CRIBBED OFF HIM ALL THE WAY THROUGH SCHOOL. HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THAT. AND ABOUT THE GIRLS YOU PASSED ON TO HIM. WELL, I DIDN'T PASS EXACTLY. AH, HE, HE TOOK THEM. ME, TOO? I PUT THE REST OF HIS THINGS IN HERE. OH, SORRY. NO, NO. THAT'S-- THAT'S MINE. BURNT? OH, NO, QUINT, NOT YOU, TOO. YES? VESEY, SIR. OH, UH... YES. VESEY, UH, COME IN. OH, THE, UH, SQUADRON LEADER'S UNIFORM, SIR. MRS. SCOTT ASKED ME TO... I'LL GET DRESSED AND--AND DRIVE YOU HOME. HOW MANY MILES DOES IT DO TO THE GALLON? NOT MANY. WHY DON'T YOU SELL HER? SHH. SHE'LL HEAR YOU. SHE'S A TEMPERAMENTAL OLD BITCH AS IT IS. I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST THAT MESS LIFE COARSENS THE VOCABULARY SOMEWHAT. I KNOW. IT PLAYED HAVOC WITH SCOTTY'S. YOU KNOW WHAT I REGRET MOST? NOT KNOWING WHAT SORT OF FATHER HE'D HAVE MADE. I'D LOVE TO HAVE SEEN HIM WITH HIS CHILDREN. WE'D EVEN PICKED THE NAMES. IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED OR ANYTHING YOU WANT, YOU WILL CALL ME, WON'T YOU? YES. BUT DON'T WORRY, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO FORMAL. I'M SORRY. IT'S--IT'S JUST THAT I... WELL, I FEEL SORT OF EMBARRASSED. IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE EVER REALLY BEEN ALONE TOGETHER. WELL, WHEN SCOTTY WAS WITH US, WE WERE ALL PART OF THE SAME FAMILY. NOW, IT--IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT SOMEHOW. YOU FEEL GUILTY. OH, QUINT. THAT'S VERY REVEALING. YES, IT IS, ISN'T IT? I'M SORRY. DON'T KEEP APOLOGIZING. I UNDERSTAND. YOU DO? YES. THE DAY SCOTTY JOINED THE SQUADRON, HIS OLD NAVIGATOR MARRIED A GIRL JUST 2 WEEKS AFTER HER FIRST HUSBAND WAS KILLED. HE WAS A PILOT. I REMEMBER BEING ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED. 4 DAYS AFTER THE WEDDING, HE GOT SHOT DOWN. THEN I UNDERSTOOD. TIME IS SO PRECIOUS. IT'S ABOUT THE ONLY THING THEY DON'T GIVE US RATION COUPONS FOR. AH, AIR COMMODORE HUFFORD, THIS IS SQUADRON LEADER MUNROE FLIGHT LIEUTENANT-- YOU FLEW KEMBLE OVER CHARLON, DIDN'T YOU, MUNROE? YES, SIR. THAT'S CORRECT. GOOD MAN, WAS KEMBLE. HE'D HAVE BEEN DECORATED FOR THE RESULTS HE GOT. EXCELLENT! COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT THIS. WE MADE THIS MODEL FROM KEMBLE'S PHOTOGRAPHS. HOLD THOSE A MINUTE, WOULD YOU, MASON? NOW, WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT IS? IT LOOKS LIKE A TUNNEL, SIR. OF COURSE IT'S A TUNNEL. WE KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN THAT. DOWN THERE... THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE HATCHING THEIR NEW BIRD. WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO, MUNROE, IS TO CHUCK A BOMB IN THERE AND ADDLE THEIR EGGS FOR THEM. IN THERE? COMMAND PLANS A LOW-LEVEL, SATURATION-BOMB MISSION BY AT LEAST 2 SQUADRONS OF MOSQUITOES. NOW YOU'D LEAD A SPECIALLY TRAINED FLIGHT FOR THIS SPECIALIST TASK. SPECIALIST TASK? I WOULD SAY IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT A BOMB IN THERE. NONSENSE. BLINDS DOWN, MASON. WE'LL RUN THAT FILM AGAIN. THIS IS TOP-SECRET FILM, MUNROE. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS A DEVELOPMENT OF BARNES WALLIS. THE HYDRAULICS START THE BOMB SPINNING. BUT HERE'S THE JOKER. THIS BOMB BOUNCES ON LAND. IN A STRAIGHT LINE? YES. REGARDLESS OF TERRAIN. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL, I'VE RUN THIS PRINT A THOUSAND TIMES. THE CIVILIAN SCIENTISTS HAVE IRONED MOST OF THE WRINKLES OUT FOR YOU. YOUR JOB WILL BE TO PERFECT THE TECHNIQUE UNDER COMBAT CONDITIONS. WELL, I THINK WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH. THANK YOU, MASON. THERE YOU ARE, THEN. BARNES WALLIS, GOD BLESS HIM, HAS DONE YOUR JOB FOR YOU, PRACTICALLY. YOUR BOMBS WOULD HAVE A TIME FUSE. NOW IF YOU WENT IN AT EXACTLY 60 FEET. SI-- WHY, IT'D TAKE MONTHS TO GET THAT ACCURATE. WELL YOU HAVE 10 DAYS TO PRACTICE. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY JUST 10 DAYS. THE FRENCH UNDERGROUND REPORTS THE FIRST OF THE GERMANS' NEW WEAPONS WILL BE READY IN 12 DAYS. YOU'LL HAVE SPECIAL BOMBSIGHTS AND DUMMY BOMBS TO WORK WITH. THEY'RE BUILDING A REPLICA OF THE CHARLON TUNNEL RIGHT NOW. ANY JUSTICE IN THE WORLD, YOU'LL BE A NATIONAL HERO. WHAT DO YOU SAY, MUNROE, HMM? WHAT ARE THE ODDS? ABOUT THE SAME AS SPITTING IN AN AIR COMMODORE'S EYE FROM AN EXPRESS TRAIN, SIR. I LIKE THAT. YES, I DO LIKE THAT. SENSE OF HUMOR. HE'LL DO NICELY, WING COMMANDER. JUST THE MAN. NOW, GET YOUR TEAM TOGETHER AND PRACTICE. STOP THAT ROCKET FLYING, AND YOU'LL TAKE YEARS OFF THE WAR. REMEMBER THAT. YEARS.

THERE'LL BE A BRIEFING IN ONE HOUR FOR ALL DUTY OFFICERS. WELL, THAT IS THE SITUATION. YOU KNOW IT ALL NOW. YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD ALL JUST BEFORE YOU WENT. AND THE DIRECTIVE REMAINS. CHARLON MUST BE DESTROYED. BUT SIR, SUPPOSE-- TEMPLETON, YOU WILL DO YOUR JOB, AND I WILL DO MINE. NOW, JUST LOOK AT THIS MATTER. IF THE WORK AT CHARLON CONTINUES, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MIGHT DIE. THE WHOLE OF SOUTHERN ENGLAND DEVASTATED, OUR BRIDGEHEAD IN EUROPE DESTROYED. THE INVASION PUSHED BACK MONTHS. COULDN'T THE PARATROOPS GO IN, SIR, INSTEAD OF BOMBERS? THEY'D BE SLAUGHTERED BEFORE THEY TOUCHED DOWN. WHAT ABOUT THE FRENCH UNDERGROUND? THE GERMANS ARE ON THE ALERT. NO. IT MUST BE A STRIKE FROM THE AIR. THERE MAY BE A WAY, SIR. WHILE WE'RE ATTACKING THE TUNNEL, WE DETACH ONE AIRCRAFT TO BREACH THE WALL. THE FRENCH UNDERGROUND MOVE THROUGH THE BREACH, TAKE ON THE GERMANS ACTUALLY IN THE CASTLE, AND HELP OUR CHAPS OUT. JUST AHEAD OF OUR BOMBING ATTACK? YES. AND THEN WHAT? WELL, THEN, IT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. SCUTTLING OUT OF THE TRAP, RUNNING IN ALL DIRECTIONS? WELL, AT LEAST THIS WAY THEY WON'T DIE UNDER OUR OWN BOMBS. YES, ALL RIGHT. I CAN SEE SOME SENSE IN IT. THEN YOU GET HEADQUARTERS TO APPROVE THE PLAN. THEY'LL HAVE TO SECURE THE COOPERATION OF THE FRENCH UNDERGROUND. THE UNDERGROUND COULDN'T MOUNT AN EFFORT ON THIS SCALE. AND EVEN IF THEY COULD, THOSE PRISONERS WHO AREN'T KILLED WHEN YOU BLAST OPEN THE PRISON WALL, WOULD BE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE CASTLE. LOCKED UP IN DOZENS OF CUBBYHOLES AND CELLARS. YOU'D NEED A FORCE THAT COULD SUBDUE THE WHOLE GERMAN GARRISON AND STAND OFF REINFORCEMENTS FROM OUTSIDE. NO, SQUADRON LEADER, I APPLAUD YOUR MOTIVES, BUT YOUR SCHEME IS IMPRACTICABLE. GIVING MEN A CHANCE FOR THEIR LIVES IS IMPRACTICABLE? YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT WITH THESE PRISONERS. HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF THE MEN ON THE GROUND YOU'RE ASKING TO RISK THEIR LIVES? NOTHING MUST BE ATTEMPTED THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE STRIKE. SUPPOSING... SUPPOSING JUST BEFORE WE BLOW THE WALL, THE--THE PRISONERS COULD BE GATHERED TOGETHER IN ONE SAFE PLACE. COULD NOT THE UNDERGROUND THEN TAKE THEM OVER AND GET THEM OUT O-O-ON THE, ON THE ESCAPE ROUTE? MOST OF THOSE THAT SURVIVE, I WOULD SAY. THEN SCHEDULE THE ATTACK FOR SUNDAY MORNING. SUNDAY MORNING? SUNDAY MORNING. OF COURSE. OF COURSE. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING, PADRE. GOOD DAY, MY SONS. GOOD MORNING, FATHER. AH, LT. SCHACK, BONJOUR. BONJOUR, FATHER BELLAGUE. THE CONFESSIONAL IS ALL READY FOR YOU. THANK YOU. PLEASE REMOVE YOUR GUARDS. I CANNOT ASK THESE MEN TO MAKE THEIR CONFESSIONS TO GOD WITH A GUN AT THEIR BACKS. SORRY, FATHER. THE COMMANDANT'S ORDERS. I THINK HE SUSPECTS YOU WILL GIVE OUT MORE THAN ABSOLUTION IN THE CONFESSIONAL. PERHAPS YOU PREFER ME TO HEAR MY CONFESSIONS IN THE OPEN, WHERE HIS ENTIRE GARRISON COULD WATCH. AS YOU PLEASE, FATHER. HERE. FATHER, GIVE ME YOUR BLESSING, FOR I HAVE SINNED-- KEEP YOUR LIPS MOVING, SON, LISTEN CAREFULLY. I WILL NOT REPEAT WHAT I HAVE TO SAY. TELL ALL YOUR MEN THAT THEY ARE TO BE AT MASS IN CHAPEL ON SUNDAY MORNING. TELL THEM THAT THE ORDER IS FROM AIR COMMAND. NOW, MY SON. FOR I HAVE SINNED THROUGH MY FAULT, THROUGH MY FAULT, THROUGH MY MOST GRIEVOUS FAULT. GO IN PEACE AND PRAY FOR ME. KEEP YOUR LIPS MOVING, SON, AND LISTEN CAREFULLY. WHEN ALL THE MEN ARE IN CHAPEL TOMORROW MORNING AND THE ATTACK BEGINS, THEY ARE TRYING TO GET YOU OUT. THANK GOD! GENTLEMEN, THIS MISSION MUST BE EXECUTED WITH EXACTING PRECISION, BOTH IN TIMING AND ACCURACY. THIS TUNNEL... MUST BE CLOSED. MUNROE, CLARK AND BANNISTER WILL FLY THE FIRST PHASE. EACH OF THEIR MOSQUITOES WILL CARRY 2 HIGHBALL BOMBS, ONE OF WHICH IS CAPABLE OF DESTROYING THE ENTIRE UNDERGROUND FACILITY. MUNROE, AS SOON AS ONE OF YOU PUTS A BOMB INTO THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, YOU MAY PROCEED TO BREACH THE WALL. THE PRISONERS WILL BE WAITING IN THE CHAPEL. NOW, ONCE THE WALL IS DESTROYED, MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH UNDERGROUND WILL START DIVERSIONARY SKIRMISHES SO THAT OUR MEN WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO HEAD FOR THE WOODS TO THE WEST. MINUTES LATER, WAVES OF MOSQUITOES WILL LEVEL CHARLON. ANY QUESTIONS? TAKE OFF AT 0625 HOURS TOMORROW. DISMISSED. LOOKS AS THOUGH IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY SLOPPY OVER CHARLON. DAMNED RAIN COULD RUIN WHAT LITTLE CHANCES WE DID HAVE. RAIN OR NO RAIN, WE GO TOMORROW. DID THOSE SILLY BLIGHTERS AT INTELLIGENCE TELL US HOW WE'RE GONNA GET A DECENT BOUNCE OFF THIS MUCK? YEAH, JUST BEFORE YOU SHOOT, YOU USE MY GUARANTEED EQUALIZER. OH, WHAT'S THAT? JUST BEFORE YOU SHOOT, YOU SPIT ON YOUR FIRING THUMB. WHAT'S SO HILARIOUS, CHUM? YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN A BIT WORRIED ABOUT HIM RECENTLY. I THOUGHT HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A BIT SERIOUS ABOUT HIS JOB. IS THAT SO BAD? WHEN A MAN LIKE QUINT MUNROE STARTS TO GET SERIOUS, HE GETS CAUTIOUS. THAT'S WHEN HIS LUCK DESERTS HIM. AND US? AND US. HEY. THEY WON'T LET ME SEE DOUGLAS. I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THAT ALREADY. I THOUGHT IF I CAME HERE TO THE BASE, I... I HAD TO SEE YOU, QUINT. WELL, I--I CAN'T STAY LONG. CAN'T YOU AT LEAST TELL ME WHY HE'S CONFINED TO HIS QUARTERS... WHY I CAN'T SPEAK TO HIM? INSUBORDINATION. THAT'S NOT TRUE. TO WHOM? THE WING COMMANDER. I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE. WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN? TOMORROW. WITH LUCK? COME BACK, QUINT. I COULDN'T BEAR IT IF YOU DIDN'T. STAND EASY, PLEASE. WELL, DON'T WORRY, I'M GOING TO SPARE YOU MY USUAL TEDIOUS PEP TALK. YOU'VE BEEN BRIEFED. YOU KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR MISSION. JUST REMEMBER THAT OUR BOMBER WAVE WILL START THEIR DROP AT PRECISELY 1000 HOURS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT ALL OUR PRISONERS ARE OUT OF CHARLON. SO ANY DELAY IN DEALING WITH THE TARGETS ASSIGNED TO YOU COULD BE EXTREMELY COSTLY. WELL, THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY, EXCEPT TO WISH EACH OF YOU GOOD LUCK. ATTENTION. GOOD MORNING, GENTLEMEN. STAND EASY. I'M TOLD THE WEATHER OVER CHARLON WILL BE IDEAL FOR OUR PURPOSES TODAY. EVERYONE FEELING WELL? YES, THANK YOU, SIR. PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER BREAK THIS NEWS, SIR. AS YOU WISH, WING COMMANDER. IT'S FROM AIR MARSHAL, GENTLEMEN. A SLIGHT CHANGE IN YOUR ORDERS. YOU ARE NOT TO ATTACK THE PRISON WALL UNTIL YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SEALED THAT TUNNEL. WHAT IF IT TAKES ALL 6 HIGHBALLS TO DO THE JOB, SIR? THEN, REGRETTABLY, THE ESCAPE PLAN IS ABORTED. THE UNDERGROUND HAS ORDERS TO WITHDRAW. LEAVE OUR CHAPS TO BE BLOWN TO HELL? THE TUNNEL HAS FIRST PRIORITY. THE ESCAPE PLAN IS A BONUS OPERATION. THIS DAMN MISSION MADE SENSE WITH A HIGHBALL FOR THE PRISON, BUT THIS IS OBSCENE. THAT'S ENOUGH!
