Once the railroad gets through to Sweetwater, this small town will become the big city it was always destined to be. I see you're a man with big plans. I figure you must know everything that goes around here. Am I correct? Well, I do pride myself in keeping informed about the constituents. Yes, for their sakes, you understand. You might have heard about these four or five man who massacred folks in a church over on Las Cruces a couple of days ago. A most horrible and vile act. You know, I reckon so. Heard they took a woman. You a law man? Pinkerton? Something like that. They said they wore long coats and umm... that fit the description of anyone that you might know? No, it doesn't. Well, they killed the priest too. Yes, I heard of it. What do you know about that? I know nothing about it! It's absurd to even to ask. Townsfolk heard something and passed some information along. But I'm not certain about it, why would I be? Don't lose your wits now. Just asking. Sure, it was a most horrendous act to witness. I won't take anymore of your time Mr. Mayor.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER] This town has changed a hell of a lot since Johnson became Mayor Like, soon after he was sworn in, the Sheriff got shot in the back. and a day later, he appoints his friend Mosely as the new Sheriff Some folk around here get real suspicious, oh, they do. -The law? Johnson and Mosely are in cahoots. They've got cut in everything in town, so they have. The saloon, the restaurant, cathouse, you name it. They've got their dirty little paws on it. -very profitable. -hmm. Indeed. But not as profitable as the latest acquisition. Which is? Well- word around town is they've got themselves a little silver mine. so they have. Two prospectors found the claim but only one return. As soon as he got back with a big chunk of silver oar, he disappeared. -Strange. -That's what I thought. You reckon Johnson's got something to do with it? Indeed, I do. Now that he's found the claim.
