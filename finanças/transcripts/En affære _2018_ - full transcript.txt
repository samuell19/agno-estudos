Very good, I think. -And you feel good? -I enjoy it very well here. No rotten eggs? -You think of the students? -Yes. No, they are so cozy. What fun to hear. They are different, of course. -All are cozy, but ... -It's fine. -That people are different? -It is good. I will have... I'm done here. Trine-Lise? Excuse me, I just ... You said I'd take over as a class director -for she who is on sick leave. I just wonder how long I am should have that responsibility. -It's about a couple of months. -Yes.

I know the hell, I don't know him. What a fucking thing. You should go to the school sister and see if you need to be sewn. It is not needed. Are you dizzy? You sure? -It's fine. -No pressure behind the eyes? -Nothing. - Can I feel your neck? -Yes. Let's see. Does this hurt? -No. -Not? - This, then? - It feels, but doesn't hurt. The neck feels good. Take it easy today, it's probably the best. I've heard you broke your neck. Have you heard that? -Is it true? -Yes it's true. It was a long time ago. What happened? I would qualify for a competition and missed a salto. Right. Are you restored now? Yes. Though I have a couple of screws at the back. -Seriously? -Yes. - Can I feel it? - On the screws? I don't know if it is possible know them. Maybe one. It's in the middle. I know it. There it is. You don't seem so lame. No, that way I was lucky. You still have time for the mat. Walk carefully. - Hey, Astrid. -Hello. Mark? Anita // 20:43 - Forget what happened Today, it should never have happened. Cool day today? Excuse? I just said that it was a cool day. That was it. You have to count on that when working at a school. I don't really know that. It's fun with some action. That something happens. That it's not just clean and cleaned all the time. Or? But you talk to the parents? Is that my responsibility? It is so badly forced. -Certainly. -It is good. What happens? Is that something fun? -Tell. -No, it just ... Tell me now. -What is it? - Just a girlfriend who was joking. What was she joking about? Tell me what she was joking about. It seemed so fun. It's a long story and difficult to explain. Now I take the weekend. - You stay? -A little while. Should we take a beer? Or maybe a glass of wine. No thanks. It's great. Sure it is. But... You gotta be so nice. Turn off when you go. Otherwise, people become acidic. No. Or maybe, you never know. Have a good one. No. Has it been a good week? Yes. I think it has been fine. How has your week been? It has been full, but then it should be. The white roses in the aisle, who are they from? They were outside the door when I came home. Was there no card? No. There was not. -Welcome. -Thanks. Nämen! -Here, Anita? -That's me. -Hey, Unni. -It was a long time ago. -Long time no see. - Really not. -Hello. -Hello. You're like you. We trained gymnastics together many years ago. -Anita Lønstrup. -Lars Simensen. Nice. Sit down. We know each other, Markus and do not need health. A little thing before we start. Markus has football training seven o 'clock. It's good if we are manage a little earlier. -It probably goes well. -You can come a little late? He has a match this weekend. How important can this be? - The guy threw soft drinks on him. -Lars. - Can I say something? -Absolutely. I'm very sorry for what happened. It was the wrong way to react. I'm totally against violence. I think violence is wrong. He has learned a lesson. Then maybe we are ready here? This school has a strict policy current events like this. I promised to greet from Simens parents And say they were considering a policereport. But they changed. -Now you get the fuck give you. I promised to say so. Don't say I'm gonna calm down. What do you mean, really? The thing is that the principal - has decided that Markus will not join the class trip to Berlin. You must be joking. But he has started to raise money. His grandmother, who has a low pension - Have bought ten packages with the world's driest biscuits. -Yuk? -We must not lose your temper. But isn't that a bit strict? This is not my decision. -The school trip is the highlight of the year. -I understand that it feels so. You know how they are at that age. Is it really so serious? The school has this strict policy. -It's a zero tolerance. -It's absolutely incredible. Well, that's what it is. One must not fight. If anyone throws anything at you turn you back. There is nothing you can influence. We'll talk about this and come back to you. Maybe we should talk to a lawyer ... Then I just wonder if you had more questions? No not right now. Then we finish here and keep in touch. -Have a good one. -Have a nice day. Well, Unni. - We'll talk more. - I'll call you. Are you coming home for dinner? No! Hi. This is not wise, Markus. This is fucking disgusting! Should I drive you home? -I'm cycling. -Yes, you're biking. Okay, that's ... It is very good for the environment. No, but ... yep. Then you just get ... It was weird. I noticed it right away. Sick strange. -Very strange. -Good thing you noticed. A hug then. You smell great. -See you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. Come on! The vests! You have to get to English.

We were more, but people jump off, of different reasons. -What do you read? - "Without a thread" by Jens Bjørneboe. Is it good, or? I think it was very good. Entertaining in any case. It reminded more of the youth. There are so many black souls. - People are completely ... -Yes. I thought it would be much more explicit. It was forbidden. It's still it. You should read "Sodom's 120 Days" by Marquis de Sade. -Is it new? -No. It's very old, from the 18th century. 1700, then it is very old.

Hasse, as he is called, has two adult daughters. -Have you got it good? - It works very well. There is someone who has it. Don't start now. - Did you have more wine? - Yes, I have more wine.

" "... and put me in bed with a book." "It was the" Fisherman's Nest "by Bjørnson." "If the travel bag was increased with NOK 5,000 "- - "Everything would change." "I really should thank Dr Petterson for everything. " "I thought it would have been nice to have him here in bed. " "Just lie in his arms and have it nice. " "I think I dreamed about him that night. " It is so nice. - Do you think that was fine? -Delicious. Where did you go? Excuse me, I felt suddenly not good. I just needed some air and water in the face. But now I feel better. - Eat some cheesecake. It was really good. You're probably good at baking. That's exactly what I'm really fond of. -Was it good? -I'll be completely ... You seem healthier now. - I was very excited. -What's in the cake? Markus: Isn't that the song from Armageddon? Anita: What is it? Markus: A movie Anita: We must see it My. Mike.

Actually, I'm out with my husband. I just wanted to talk to Markus. - He wasn't at school today. - Wasn't he? Did not you know that? Another student said he was sick. No I do not think so.

Are we talking about the same person? -I think so. -My in class. Yes. You didn't believe that we talked about us? No, are you insane? It had been scary. It had looked like that. You are 50 years old, as well. Did you get together with Mina recently? Together I do not know. We are dating. Cozy, she seems to be a nice girl. Yes, she ... She's fair. Have you talked to the headmaster about the trip to Berlin? Can I go to Berlin? Have you talked to the headmaster about it? -No. -Not? Do it then. -Do you want to taste? -No thanks. - Do you need to be pushed somewhere? - I'm going to the guys. Do you open, or? The lock. It's locked. Parental. Thousand thanks. See you on Monday. -Fat. Aerobics. -Aerobics. Excuse. Excuse. Absolutely, she sucked him. Nice weekend. Journey to Budapest. What do you say about it? What do I say about it? I think it will be really nice. Budapest is absolutely wonderful. A great city. But it won't be as good if we wait for spring? Why? It's just a little much now. I have two days in Frankfurt, I'm going to London And you also seem to have a lot. Yes... It's all right, we can take it later. We can talk about it in the spring again. It's much better. Warmer. Just. There is some crisis at work. Thanks for the good food. You're a great cook. See you tomorrow. Sleep tight. Sleep tight. Give me five laps around the school in a quiet pace! Come on! Then we meet here afterwards. Come on! No whining! My? Are you there? It's Anita. You. What happened? If you can't open, then we talk a little. But usch then. What happened? But usch then. What happened? Someone has put a card on me on Facebook. What then too short? - A skitful nude image. -Well then. Who does something like that? Do not know. It was Markus who took the card. -You think Markus put it out? -I dont know, maybe. It is absolutely terrible in that case. Oh, terrible. But hear here. Now I don't know you well and I don't know Markus either. But you seem to be an incredibly nice girl- - who should have a nice boyfriend and I don't think Markus is kind. Do you hear it? He is not kind. - So you shouldn't have it. -No. Right? Come on. This wasn't fun. Poor you. How's your mother? It's not my mother. But then Ragnhild. I haven't talked to her for many years. -How's it going for Markus? -Just great. I think so. We haven't talked much, he seems to be full. What do you mean by that? He seems to have got a girlfriend. Right, she ... -My in class? -I know. - Incredibly cute girl. -I don't agree with that. -You know her. -I shouldn't say anything. -I think it's good for him. -Good you think so. She is very good at to appear as cute. Pulling the ponytail and ... A fucking dangerous girl, I think. When you say it so they teased the other day. But considering the sounds I heard tonight they have probably come across it. My God what they are active at that age. - They are on. Were we such? -Not me. Mark? Markus! -Where is it? -I need to talk with you. -You must stop stalking me. -Stalka you? I'm looking for a reason. I have something important to say. Come on! What the hell is that? I am pregnant. How far are you? No, it's ... You know that. It's about six weeks. - Are you absolutely sure ...? -Yes. I think it is similar to you. Don't you go on the pill? No, I do not. My husband sterilized himself, so it hasn't been ... How nice. Good. Don't be sorry, Markus. Markus ... Usch then. Do not be sad. It's hard to see you like this. It will be alright. It will be alright. Okay? It will be fine. We can handle it together. I am so stupid. No, don't say that. You are absolutely fantastic. You are absolutely fantastic. You're not stupid. Okay? But then we agree? That this stays between us? Okay? What are you thinking about? -You don't say anything to Mina? -If I say anything to Mina? No of course not. Why would I tell her? This is between us. Markus, this is our secret. Do you understand? It's just about you and me. But then we will soon be seen? -Yes. -Right? Send a message. do not forget to reply to my messages. I get so stressed out when you do not respond. Answer quickly, so I won't be so stressed. Nice. See you. -Bye. -Bye. Hi. Is it you? Are you out and about? Shop a little? I just tried a skirt. -Peach. - Maybe it is. I'm just looking out. My mother turns 67 years old. Congratulations. I'll just pay. I have thought of one thing. Have you heard any rumors about ... About a student from VG1, who had it together with his teacher? I haven't heard anything about that. Not anything. But I'll check that out. Because I... I walked past the school dining room. Some girls talked and it became very concrete. I was just wondering if you knew anything. Such girls say very strange things. -How did it feel? - It was nice. I am in error parked and may come back later. See ya. Anita // 18.28 Why don't you answer when I call? We have to talk! WHORE Hi. Why don't you answer when I call? Have you called? I did not know that. I miss you. Your beautiful face. Your soft skin, the warmth of your body. Do you feel like to come to me tonight? My husband is away, we can make pizza ... ... see a football game, only the two of us. Fuck you! Everything is here. What are you doing, Anita? Are you pregnant? No. If you touch my son once more ... Then I kill you. -Do you understand?! I kill you! -I understand. Do you have a room available? A free room, yes. We can do that. -How long are you staying? -I do not know. No. I need a card to register. So there. Yes, as you probably know it - -flored some rumors in recent days. When that happens- - it tends to lead to some misunderstandings. It is best that Anita gets herself explain what happened. Then you can pass it on to the students. I just feel ... Whatever you think or say then you are right. When it comes to everything. You are so damn relieved that you are not me. I do not get it why i should stand here ... It is completely pointless. Do you want me to say that ...? I think they need an explanation. This should not have happened. I just don't understand ... It is so fucking unnecessary. Damn it, this is completely ... Anita. Hasse? Hasse! I ... didn't know people would react so hard. People were so upset. School and ... mother. It's completely ... It was the same with the trip to Berlin. It solved, but ... Hasse is a good guy. But you probably find another one good guy you can have kids with. You... You're a good woman. Good luck with everything.
