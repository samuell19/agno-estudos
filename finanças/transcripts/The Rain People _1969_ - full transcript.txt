He's just going to wake up and find you gone? I left him a note with breakfast. Well, what does the note say? It said I loved him. That's all? It said not to worry. How can you expect him not to worry? A woman gets up at 6 A.M., leaves her husband. You expect him not to worry? Wait, mama. I did not say I was leaving him. I didn't say that. I said I just wanted to be free for a minute, five minutes, half a day, an hour, I don't know! Shh! Hey, shh. [Door opens] Hi, nat. Good morning, daddy. Something wrong, baby, huh? [Beth] No, nothing's wrong, Lou. I just couldn't sleep. I thought i'd talk to mama. Oh. Where's vinny? Vinny's in the car, listening to the radio. I'll tell him to come in. Daddy. Vinny's not out in the car. He's at home in bed asleep. Lou, baby, why don't you go to bed, too? Wait a minute. I don't get this. Vinny's home... Asleep? And you're here at 6 A.M.? Sorry, daddy, I didn't mean to wake you up. I don't mind that. Just tell me what's wrong. I'm your father. Lou-- mind if I talk in my own house? Don't "Lou" me! Want some coffee? [Band plays Italian tarantella] [Female voice] ...Of paintings and artwork. Did you go to see... Operator, I'd like to make a long-distance call, please, uh, to long island, New York. What number? The number's 599-4667. Do you have the area code? Uh, 516. Thank you. Could I make it a collect call, please? Thank you. [Routing tones] Rate for mechanicsburg to 516-599... Thank you. One moment, please. [Routing tones] Your name and number, please. My name is Natalie ravenna, and the number is 766-9963. Thank you. [Ringing] [Vinny] Hello? Will you accept charges? Nat, is that you? Yes, it is. Will you accept the charge? Nat, where the hell are you? Yes, I'll accept the charge. Thank you. Go ahead. Vinny? Nat, where are you? I... I'm--i'm at a gas station. Pennsylvania turnpike. I called you before, but you were out. I was at your mother's house. She's having a fit. Your father even stayed off from work. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone over there. It's o.K., nat, o.K.? Everything is o.K. Now just come home. I can't. Not yet. Tomorrow... Maybe. I don't know. What's wrong? What's wrong? I... I just had to get away for a while. The married lady, she-- she was getting desperate. I... Vinny... I don't understand. Vinny... Yeah. Yeah, I'm here. Well, do you think-- come home. Maybe I was too independent or something? I mean... What are you talking about? Well, I used to wake up in the morning, and it was my day, and now... It belongs to you. You were fine. You were fine. Look, where are you? Are you really on the Pennsylvania turnpike? Yes. Where on the Pennsylvania turnpike? I don't know. I, um... The station. The gas station. Why didn't you talk to me? I would've gone with you. Well, I... I didn't want to-- why didn't you say to me, "vinny, I want to talk." I--i didn't want to go away with you. I wanted to get away from you. Vinny? What did I do? Vinny-- what is it? It's not you, it's not you. It isn't. It's... Well, tell me. Well, uh... She's pregnant. Who? She. Me. Your wife. Oh, that's beautiful. Is that what this is? Is that what you're--you're afraid of? I-- that makes me very happy. I know. Then what-- I knew it would make you happy, vinny. That's why I had to have the telephone between US. I just have a hunch I'm not ready to be a mother. I'm not even sure I know what it means to be a wife. Oh, vinny, I'm glad I can't see your face right now. Nat... Please, don't you do anything. Don't you do anything. What? Just don't let anybody touch you-- no. Or our baby. I'm not-- please! I'm not going to do anything, vinny. You promise? I promise. Oh, what the hell, nat, come on home. We can take care of this. I can't talk. Listen, I can't talk anymore, vinny. I love you. [Indistinct protest] And I'll come home soon. Look, I love you. I love-- goodbye. Bye. Don't leave-- We don't get very many daytime sleepers. You don't? Well, sometimes some truckers. No luggage? No. Thank you. Can I have a ride? What's your name? Jimmie. You can call me killer. Killer? Yeah. People call me killer gannon 'cause my name is, uh, kilgannon. All right. What's your name? What? What's your name? You never told me your name. My name is Sara. Sara? Where'd you ever get a name like killer gannon? Playing football. Are you a football player? Yeah. Where? Helmont. What's that? It's a college. You just passed it. That's where I'm coming from. You go to school there? I did. Not anymore. You graduate? No, I just left. Sara? Sara? What? I wish you could see me play football. I'd like to. [Whistle blows] We came out of this locker room, and everything was great for the second half. We put on sneakers because it was wet and icy. We scored the first touchdown. After that, it was really our game. Her father was all excited about the game. All he wanted to do was talk about ball all night. He told me if I ever wanted a summer job, I should just look him up in West Virginia. I was going to buy a map, but I forgot. It's getting late. We could stop. I have, uh, plenty of money. Well, we ought to stop. We ought to have dinner. Goodnight. [Soft music plays] Killer. What? I was just thinking about your name. Killer gannon... Do you dance? I can dance. Want to dance? Not now. But later maybe. Come in. Take off your shirt. How come? She just wants to see what a football player looks like without his shirt on. Sure. Impressive. Me? No. The way you listen to orders. Do you always do everything that anybody tells you to? Mostly. Why? No reason. It's easy. Come and dance with me. You'd be fun to play "Simon says" with. What's "Simon says"? Don't you know what "Simon says" is? No. Weren't you ever a kid? Simon says... Pick me up. Simon says pick you up? Simon says... Spin me around. Spin you around. Faster. Faster! Faster! Stop. You're not supposed to stop. But you said stop. But I have to say Simon says stop, then you stop. Do you understand? No. All right, put me down. I'm serious. Put me down. No. Put--put me down. Put me down. You have to say Simon says put me down. Down! Simon says. Simon says put me down. You are the most obedient man I've ever met in my life. Look at me. Aren't you? Yes. Aren't you? Yes. Aren't you? Yes. All right. How obedient are you? Why? Get down on your knees. Get down on your knees. All right, now bow down to me. Simon says. Forget about Simon says. You just bow down to me when I tell you to. Now, go on. What's that? Hey, I'm sorry. Stand up. I was just playing around with you. Stand up! What's that on your head? It's a scar. [Whistle blows] My mother and I used to walk around the campus a lot in winter... And everyone would say hi to me, you know, when they came out of classes. I'm still sort of a hero at school, really. Even though I couldn't play ball anymore... They gave me a lot of money. Look. Put it away. Be careful. You'll lose it. I won't lose it. Someone will take it from you. No, they won't. Why'd they give you that money? Because, uh... Because I was a hero. Everyone remembered. They gave you that money and asked you to leave? Well, I couldn't play ball anymore. I didn't have to go to classes anymore. I didn't have to do anything except rake the leaves. Then they gave me this, and, uh... And they asked you to leave. Yeah. What are you going to do? I'm going to get a job. I have his address, her father's. All right. We'll see about it tomorrow. I saved it. Go to your room. Go to bed. I'm not... I'm not tired. Simon says go to bed. The rain people are... People made of rain. And when they cry, they disappear altogether, because they cry themselves away. Where did you hear about the rain people? I don't remember. Were they in a story someone told you? No. It's true. Did you ever see them? Once I saw them. What do they look like? They look like... They look like ordinary people. Only she is... Very, very beautiful, and he is handsome. And, uh... Made of rain. * yes, if you'd like to see the truth * * I better tighten up your wig * * girl, you're minus tomorrow * * no surprise if you * bet on a friend * you'll be blind in both eyes * * oh, let me see your head, girl * * we've got to make it bigger * There you go. There you go. See it come out? Artie? All right, get some oil in there. You'll have to make a lot of popcorn. Artie? Yeah? Hi, Artie. Hello. Uh, I'm killer gannon. Who? I'm a friend of your daughter Ellen's from school. I met you two years ago. Oh, sure, the football player. Yeah, I remember you, killer. That was one hell of a game in the mud. Thanksgiving game. I'll never forget that play in the fourth quarter. You were three touchdowns ahead, and you took it around on a keeper play. So you tucked it away and ran in for a touchdown. Remember? No. Look, why don't you stop by the house? Ellen's home now, and you could stay for dinner, then come back tonight and see a movie. Hi, Ellen. Hello. What are you doing here, killer? I, uh... I came to see you. Oh. Ellen. Well, this is a boy from school, mom. Killer? Goodbye. Nice to meet you. I already met you Thanksgiving at a game. Really? I don't remember. Hello. I'm Ellen. Hi. Well... Why don't we all just come into the house? Thank you very much, but I have to go now. Well... You can't leave him here. Hey, Ellen. You know, you look different. What do you mean, different? You don't look the same. You must be tired, driving all the way from New York. How come you came here? I am. Take your shoes off and rest. You look nice, but why isn't your hair longer? Because I cut it. Oh. You can't leave him here. You'll have to take him with you. Oh, Ellen! He doesn't know what I'm talking about. Are you a friend of his? No, I'm a stranger. Perfect stranger. Well, yes, but, uh... You brought him here, so you'll have to take him back wherever you found him. Wait a minute. I said I was a stranger. He's your friend. I just gave him a lift. He's going to be working for your father. I don't think so. Artie said I could have a job. Shut up, killer. That's not nice. He doesn't care what you say to him, do you, killer? Uh...i don't care. I don't think it's right to talk like that to anyone. Well, you don't know killer gannon. You used to go out with him. Yes. But that was before. Killer, oh, yeah, they know. They gave me, uh, they gave me $1,000. $1,000, and they told me I didn't have to stay. Put the money away. Put it away. Sara. Sara. I'm, uh, i'm a little hungry. My husband won't be home for a while, or I'd invite you-- he already invited US for dinner. Said he'd be home in half an hour. Well... Why don't we all just, uh... Go into the house then? [Ellen and her mother arguing upstairs] For some reason you're pretending that nothing that anyone says bothers you. Is that right? Why? You can tell me. You'll never see me again. You are pretending... Aren't you? Hey, killer, in for 6. Caught ya! Give me that third quarter pass. Fire it off the elbow. Let's go. Right off the chest. Got too much air in it. Too bad it's dark. We could throw the ball around. Oh, Ellen, look who's here. Surprised to see the killer, honey? Very. Mr. Brook, he wants the job you offered him. What job? Oh, at the theater. Sure, why not? Artie. Planning on settling down here? Daddy. What? You don't want him working for you. Why not? Because he can't do anything except sweep leaves. Isn't that right, killer? I can sweep leaves. Sure, you can. Here, sit down, killer. [Ellen] And that's all. Did you get any pro offers? Daddy. You get some pro offers playing football? Yeah. One. You didn't take it, huh? Huh? It's good to see you. I thought when you and Ellen-- dad. I thought Ellen and you might be-- Artie. Dad. I'll tell you, killer-- dad! Please be quiet, Artie! You and Ellen. I thought you-- would you please be quiet for one minute? He is a dunce. A retarded person, and I think it's embarrassing to drag it out any further. He got banged up in a game. They put a plate in his head, and that's what came out. Come on, killer. You don't want to stay here. Goodbye, Ellen. What am I going to do with you? Why? I can't get stuck with you. I can't handle it. I've got my own problems. What problems? I'm going to have a baby. A baby. A baby, a baby, stupid. Maybe I should drop you off with the police and let them figure you out. You sure know how to pick girlfriends. All of a sudden, it's like talking to myself. Well, why? I-I'm here. Do you understand me? Yes. All right. End of the road. Get out here. Open the door. Get out! Take your bag. Why are you mad at me? I'm not mad at you. I just can't take care of you anymore. You'll have to take care of yourself now. You've got some money. Stay in a motel tonight, and tomorrow you'll get a ride. Where will I go? How in hell should I know? Go back to the school. Go back to your mother. I can't. Go back to her. I--i can't. Why not? She died. I don't care! You're an idiot! A retarded, imbecilic freak! A vegetable! A stupid, idiotic idiot! A goddamned idiot. I only picked you up in the first place because I wanted to make it with somebody new, and I end up with a freak. Get in the car. Don't you see? I...i can hardly take care of myself. [Marching music plays] Come and see this. I can't. I mean, I... Always before, i--I've been blaming you because you're the man. And you're the one that's trying to trap me and turn me into a wife with a bunch of kids. I don't think that anymore. I think it's me. I mean, I... It's my fault. I'm the one who's misled you. I'm the one that's incompetent. You married... An incompetent. I mean, you just ask my mother. She'll tell you. I'm irresponsible, and i'm... I'm cruel. I'm aimless. If I weren't cruel, I couldn't have done this to you. I don't even get up in the morning and fix your breakfast. I'm a lousy wife. I don't even want to get up. I hate to cook, and i-I'm sloppy, and I lie. I lie to you all the time. If you knew me at all, if you really knew me, you'd hate me. Vinny? I'm here, nat. Listen, I... I have to have an abortion. You don't even know what you've just done. You don't even know what you've just done! I'm telling you what I feel. That's not enough! That's what-- it's what I feel. You've just excused everything you've done by telling me how guilty you feel. I'm not impressed with your goddamn honesty! You got in your station wagon, and you're free. You made your point. Vinny... Look, Natalie, you're out there stuck with yourself, and you don't like it. For the past few days, I felt if I could be with you, I could help. But I was wrong. Because it's really in your lap. Look, you just told me you're irresponsible. But now, whether you like it or not, you're responsible for yourself and for that baby that you're carrying. I don't want any more phone calls with talk about how you feel. I want you to do something. Don't just talk anymore. I want you to do something. God damn it, you call me back. [Hangs up] Hello, killer. Thought you were gone, Sara. My name isn't Sara. It's Natalie. You said it was, uh, Sara. I lied. I didn't want you to know my real name. But it's Natalie. Oh. What are you doing here? Waiting. For what bus? No bus. I'm, uh, just waiting. Everybody else is waiting here. May I have your attention, please? Why did you go, Natalie? Westbound for... I didn't go. ...via greyhound lines is now reloading in zone four. Passengers on this coach for points west, please reclaim your seats. Hey, you can't run. Hey! Hey, killer, you like it here? Yeah, it's nice. Good. Listen, I found you a job. If you like it here, you can stay. Where will you go? Same place I was going before I met you. Where--where is that? Listen, killer, I'm going to miss you. Aah! Here's the address. Think you can find it by yourself? Uh... Never mind. I'll take you. Come on. O.k. This is it. What do they want me to do? Sweep up and carry things. You see Mr. Alfred. Um... Will you wait? O.k., I'll wait. Mr. Alfred? Yeah. I come about the job. Well, good. You're hefty. Yeah, I used to play football. Got fellas come around here are too skinny. I got a lot of heavy work. Shipments got to be loaded off a truck, cages got to be moved around. Pay you $60 a week. That all right? Yeah, that's all right. You married? No. Sure? No, I'm not married. You look like you're married to me. Oh, uh, she's my friend. Morning. Hello. We're about to close a deal. Well, good. Is everything all right? It looks all right. Find a room close by here. Delivery truck comes early. I'll give you an address if you like. That would be good. Is it for two? No. I just gave him a ride. You need an advance for rent? No. I got plenty of money. Killer. I got $1,000. See? Ooh-eee! Heh heh heh. Listen, you shouldn't carry that kind of money around loose in your pocket like that. Put the money away. Lady, can I talk to you a minute? Now, who is this fellow? I don't know him very well. I just gave him a ride. He's a hitchhiker? Yes. Single ladies shouldn't pick up hitchhikers. Oh, yes, I know. But he's-- he's very special. Sometimes he's like a little kid, like with his money. If someone doesn't make him put it in a bank, he'll carry it around in his pocket. Are you a relative? No-- are you palming off some cuckoo-nut on me? He's not like that. He just needs someone to look out for him. Hey. Is that his own money? Yes, it is. Really. And he's nothing to you. Nothing. Okey-dokey. Hey. I got a bunk back of the shack. You can stay here. O.k. Uh, listen, son, I got a safe here. I'm gonna keep that money for you till you deposit it in the bank. I'll take you there on Thursday. The president of the bank of brule is my friend. Oh, that's all right. I'll take him to the bank right now. You want me to take care of him or not? Yes, I do. We'll figure on $5.00 a week for use of the shack, which I'll deduct from your pay. Hey, palooka, you hear me? Yeah. [Shouting] Do you want your meals here? Yeah! Figure on $1.50 a day for the meals, and I'll lose money on it. We'll make it $10 a week, which I'll deduct from your pay. Now, let's see now. That's $15 per week off of the $60, minus your federal withholding, your social security, your unemployment compensation, and your disability insurance. Yeah, you'll get about $25 per week, which I'll keep in the safe, along with the other money until you think you need it. You can start here. [Chickens cheeping] Place needs a little cleanin'. We do a big business every spring. You know, easter. Yeah, I supply cute little cuddly easter animals to retailers for a radius of 300, 400 miles around. They look like they're starving. Aw... Well, you want to call the aspca? I'll give you their number. I'll also give you a dime for the phone. Forget I said anything. You can hose it down. There's a drain in the floor. Can I take them out first? Well, where you gonna put 'em, dummy? Now, listen, these are a bunch of-- these a bunch of dumb animals. Wasn't for me, they'd be run over by tourists on the highway... Or else end up in somebody's soup. Do you--do you have a ladies room? Yes, ma'am, we do-- where it says "dolls." [Goose honks] [Honk] Son... Give me your money. I'll put it in my safe. Did she say it was o.K.? Well, who's she, your mother? No, she's my friend. She's my best friend. Oh. Well, now I'm your best friend. And I tell you, your money isn't safe unless it's in my safe. See, they call it a safe 'cause money's safe there. Don't even have the combination written down anywhere. That's all right. Mr. Alfred, could I ask you one question? Yeah, shoot. What if killer wants to quit? So he quits. What's keepin' him here? His money in your safe. We can forget the whole thing if you want. Take him with you. I can't. [Car engine starts] [Siren] You know how fast you were driving, miss? Too fast? You were driving 73 miles per hour in a 65-mile- an-hour zone. I'm sorry. Your license, please? Take the license out of your wallet, miss. Are you married? Yes, I am. Registration? New York. Your husband on this trip, ma'am? Is that part of your routine questioning? If I say so. No. My husband is not on this trip. You divorced, ma'am? No, she's not divorced. Who? She. Me. Your husband's back in New York? Yes, he is. [Police radio plays] License plate 5720j8. You checking up on me? Not you. The car, ma'am. Incredible. I was sick to my stomach a few minutes ago. Now I feel much better. Good. What are you doing so far from home without your husband? I'm getting a ticket. [Police radio plays] Ma'am... I'll forget about entering the major highway without signaling, but I'm afraid I'll have to give you this speeding citation. Could I pay you? You offering me a bribe? So help me god, the lady is not offering you a bribe. She is not offering you... Anything. She just wants to know what and where she has to pay. Well, she pays the fine at the judge's. Where's that? Alfred's reptile ranch. Y-You're kidding me. Pay at the curio counter. I--i--i can't go back there. You're gonna have to. Now, you follow me. I can't go back there! [Police radio plays] We don't have to go back to Alfred's? Can I buy you a cup of coffee? Sure. Are you on some kind of... Trip? Yes. Where? West. Where west? California? Yes. Why California? It's as far west as I can go. I thought maybe you were going to meet your husband. No. Listen, Gordon... I don't really have to go back to Alfred's, do I? If I give you the money, you could pay this ticket for me, couldn't you? That's a problem. I already wrote the citation. The papers go in, you got to go. I'll go with you. Then later on, maybe I could take the New York lady to see a movie with me or something... Just to pay her back. It's not the money. There's somebody at Alfred's that I don't want to see. Your husband? No, not my husband. But somebody. Don't worry. I'll get you out of there in a flash. Why are you laughing? You'll get me out of there in a "flash..." Gordon. [Laughs] Oh, jeez. [Laughing] [Laughing] [Laughs] [Cheeping] [Animals crashing into things] [Gordon] Is Alfred around? Yeah, he's out behind. He's got his hands full out there. [Broken glass clinking] [Glass breaking] [Pounding] [Alfred] Get the big animals! Get them big ones! Hey! Hey! Hey--you! You! Get him out of there! Get him out of there! Out of where? He's locked in the shed! Gordon, you arrest him! He's costing me a fortune, damn it! Get him out of there! Hey! [Cheeping] Get him out! Hey! Hey! Are you crazy, too? What are you laughin' at? You know what he's costin' me? Gordon, I want you stop him. No, w-w-wait. L-Listen, it's all right. I can make him stop. Killer? You got to stop it. You've got yourself in a lot of trouble. I don't care. Killer... Killer, you gotta care about yourself because nobody else will. You will. No. Not me. I can't. You came back. I didn't want to. He brought me back. I got a speeding ticket for trying to get away from you in a hurry. All right. [Alfred] Is somebody gonna stop him? It's all right. Come on, killer, stop it. Are you finished? Yeah. Gordon... Do you have to arrest him? You're goddamn right he has to arrest him! Whoo! Whooee! What about the money? What money? The money in your safe. $1,000. There's no $1,000 in my safe. I ain't even got a safe. Gordon, have I got a safe? Not that I know of. You said you had a safe. You told him you had a safe. Where would a dumb-dumb like that get $1,000? They gave it to him to live on. Look, if you keep that $1,000 in your safe that you don't have, he's as good as dead. Th-that's... That's not what I mean. All right, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll keep the $1,000 and drop the charges. He needs money. It's all he has. He doesn't-- doesn't have anything else. All right, I'll give him $100. How can he live on $100? It's no business of mine how he lives! It isn't mine, either-- all right, $200! That's it, Gordon. Go on, take it! Gordon... Killer! Thank him. Thank you, Mr. Alfred. Just get him outta here! Hey! Wait a minute! Looks like you got a $40 speeding citation you gotta take care of. Wait in the car. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. What's your name? Killer. Tell me, killer, what's the lady's story? She's run away from her husband. Is that so? What for? Oh, she doesn't know. Is there any chance of him showing up here? How about tonight? I thought you and me was gonna go see a movie or something. We did discuss that. Well, where you staying at? I don't know. What about him? Nothing about him. I explained about that. Well, if you can dump him, you can stay with me. I thought we were going to a movie... Or something. Sure, I'll take you to see a movie. Killer? Yeah? I like you very much. You do? You like me? Yes. Very much. Do you love me? I don't know. Maybe I do. I love you. I don't think you know what you're saying. I always know what I'm saying. I believe you. Believe me. I believe you. Believe me. I believe you. But do you love me? A little bit. Well, why can't I stay with you? Because there's a man back there with a black leather suit who's very interesting. Oh. You sit there like you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know. You're not being honest with me. When are you going to be honest with me? Oh, I'm always honest with you. Go to hell. At least I know you'll be taken care of there. Listen, killer... I've got a couple of things that I want to do before 6:00. I'm getting older. I can tell under my eyes. You just going to follow me around or what? Wonder if I can find an excuse for a dress in this town. So... You're just going to sit in the car while I go out on a heavy date, huh? There. Does that do it for you? [Telephone rings] [Ring] [Ring] [Operator] Hello. This is long distance calling. I have a collect call for anyone at this number from Mrs. Ravenna in ogallala, Nebraska. Do you accept charges? [Vinny] Yes. [Operator] Go ahead, ma'am. Vinny? What the hell are you doing in Nebraska? Same thing I did in Tennessee. God damn it, i'm going crazy over here. You said you'd-- look, I had no way of reaching you, nat. Why didn't you call me? I'm sorry. Vinny, i--I'm sorry. You were so angry at me. How can I help being angry? I've been sitting by this goddamn telephone for three days. I haven't moved from the house. How am I supposed to know whether you're alive or dead? You don't call me. I have no way of getting in touch with you. You bitch! Please get on a plane and come home. I can't. Goddamn, I'm gonna fly to Nebraska. Vinny, you'd never find me. Look, Natalie, I'll do anything you want. Anything. I swear it. But just come back. Look... I'll change. I'll change. I'll do anything. I'll quit my job. I'll-- look, if... If you want to lose the baby, it's o.K. It's o.K. Look, I found out we can-- we can go to Tokyo. We can go to a hospital. Look, it'll be o.K. If you d-- if you don't want kids, it'll be all right. You don't have to have them. Just come home. Natalie, when will I see you? Tell me on your terms. Just come back, Natalie. [Thump] I need-- vinny? Vinny? Why'd you do that? Uh, I want you to talk to me. But... But you... You had no right to do that to him! You... You! Why'd you do that to...Him? I've had it with you. I want nothing more to do with you. You hurt me. You just beat it! You hurt me! Go to sleep, Rosalie. My daughter. What time is it? Go back to sleep. Jesus Christ, I'm woke up already. Quit saying "Jesus Christ" every second. Well, goddamn, you do. Go back to sleep, or you get a crack in the face! I'm cold. Put on the rest of your pajamas and take off that stupid brassiere. It's not stupid. Take it off! This is Natalie. Say "how do you do" and go back to sleep. How do you do, and I'm not tired. Can I have a coke? Go to sleep, or you know where you're going. [Natalie chuckles] [Chuckling] Can I watch? You little bitch. I'm gonna break your ass. Screw you, papa! Come out of there! So you can break my ass? You little bitch! Stop talking like a goddamn little tramp! Let me wear my brassiere, papa. No, god damn it, it's stupid! If you let me... I'll come out... And I'll go outside for a couple of hours. Huh? All right! Can I wear my brassiere? Yeah. And I won't get a crack in the face? Yeah. You promised you wouldn't hit her. Well, it's not fair she locks herself in the can. I got to discipline her. She don't have a mother. Hear the language she uses? It's hard to raise a little girl when she doesn't have a mother. She shouldn't be outside now. She spends half her time out there like a little cat. I swear she can see in the dark. She'd be out there in an hour anyway playing under things. Now, forget her. I'm not going to stay. Why? I just don't want to anymore. I want to make some coffee. Now, relax. I don't like coffee. I've got some bourbon. Now, relax. [Thump thump] Forget her. [Clang] [Clang] [Clang] I hope you freeze your two bare asses off! Ungrateful little bitch. I let her wear her brassiere. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. I'll turn on the power. No, that's all right. Leave it off. Turn your flashlight off. That's better. Hello, Gordon. Yeah? I like that. It's like talking on the telephone. Gordon? Yeah? You have any records? I have some old ones. Gordon? Where's your wife? I lost my wife and a baby boy when my house caught fire four years ago. I'm sorry. You don't have to say anything. I'm sorry she died that way, but it was an unsuccessful marriage. She spent most of her time crying... And I spent mine figuring out ways I could get out of the house. At one point there, I thought I was going to leave altogether. I'll turn on the power. Meow. I hang around here a lot at night whenever my father brings a hooker into the tin can. I'm almost always hanging around here at night. You know what I do? Yeah. What, smart ass? You look in all the windows. How do you know? Jesus, you're smart. You must be the smartest man I ever met. [Arguing] She's always bragging about how much she loves her husband. If she loves him so much, how come she spends the whole night yelling at him? Once I saw a lady and her husband making it. Only he wasn't her husband, and she was no lady. 10 minutes later, I saw her husband in somebody else's trailer. It's very complicated. Look at me. Come on. Don't stall me. Don't stall me. [Laughs] Come on. Gordon... What do you want out of me? Shh. Don't talk. Come on. Shh. Talk to me. Shh. What are you thinking about? What? What are you thinking about? Nothing. You're thinking about something. Tell me. You. I'm thinking about you. No, you're not. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh, nice. Nice. Hey. Come on. I've got you all wrong. What do you mean? I've got me all wrong. Gordon... Shh. Listen. What? Listen. What? What do you hear? What do you hear? Nothing. I love your hair. Jesus, your hair is beautiful. And your smile. You've got that funny smile. Don't ever cut your hair. Gordon, you're not talking to me. You're talking to her. Who? Her. Your wife. I hated her. I hated being married to her. I was going to bust out and leave her. I married her 'cause she got pregnant. I always thought she did it on purpose. After a couple of years, I was sick of looking at her. Sometimes I'd leave so early and come back so late, I wouldn't see her for a whole week. She meant nothing to me. Absolutely nothing. Gordon... I don't want to stay. I want to leave now. Why? Never mind. New York bitch. You've been stalling me all night. I'm sorry. Look, i-I'm really very sorry, Gordon, but I have to leave now. I'm not going to let you go now. You don't want me. Don't tell me what I want. You want your wife back. Forget about my wife! Let go of me! Jesus! My wife's dead! Let me go! Aah! New York bitch! I'm going to have your ass! Please... Please. Please, Gordon, don't hurt me. I'm pregnant. I'm going to have a baby. Now, please, just let me go home. Papa! Gordon, it's your little girl. Open the door. Leave her out of this. Uhh! Aah! Stop! Killer, stop it! You can stop! Aah! Will you stop it? Stop it. Listen to me. Uhh! [Natalie] Killer! [Whistle blows] [Crowd] 4, 3, 2, 1... [Gunshot] [Horns blow and crowd cheers] Killer. You don't have to go. You can stay with me. It'll be all right. You'll see. I'll take care of you. I'll protect you. Vinny... Vinny will take care of you. I'll call him. He'll come here, and he'll take US both back. And you'll come, and you'll live with US. And we'll be a family... [Sobbing] You and me and vinny. I promise you, killer. Killer, I promise you. Vinny will like you, and... And you don't have to be by yourself anymore. [Natalie] God...
