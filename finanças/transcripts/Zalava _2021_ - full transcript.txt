1978 – IRAN FOR THE REVOLUTION A VILLAGE IN KURDISTAN A century ago settled a group of gypsies... ...that of the east traveled west... ...located in Zalava where they are local customs and rituals. But a deep fear has it stayed with her through the years... His daughter is possessed. Give back his gun. He wants to shoot her leg. Where are you taking our weapons? Where are you going? As a soldier, I have nothing to say. We must bring the weapons. Instead of fighting the demons? I'm supposed to arrest people no demons. Give back my gun. My daughter is possessed. That's better than you mutilating her. –Why don't you believe us? 'Considering the complaint from the residents of Zalava... ...and the misconduct that led to it until the death of one of the villagers..." Khalaj's daughter. '...and the illegal confiscation of shotguns... ...by order of the gendarmerie... ...Sergeant Massoud Ahmadi, head of the gendarmerie of Zalava... ...being replaced by Amin Amini... ...and will the captured guns be returned as soon as possible. This must be done by April 26 at the latest.' We're here for our guns. Next one. Assad Zavi. Sign your name. Mahdi Zavara. -Here. The top line. Next one. Give her the gun. Hurry up. Next one. Name. —Khalaj Alaghayi. Give him his gun. If my gun hadn't been taken away, if my daughter were still alive. No one is allowed to take the weapon of a Zalavan. We have permits. -How many? You kill too many animals. Many things we kill are not animals. They won't shoot anything anymore now that their guns are fucked up. Those bastards. Even guns that have been tampered with are dangerous in their hands. The nonsense in their heads is more dangerous. What happened? Why don't you have urine with you? I'll bring it tonight. What is it, Maliheh? What are you doing here? Why was the doctor arrested? That jerk was smuggling expensive furs among the doctor's urine samples. I did not know. I had a mule rented to visit Nourabad. We shall see. Have your tests not yet been completed? Well in Nourabad. The mule carries it. The tests in Zalava are not finished yet. We could have sent a car. Why did you hire a mule? I didn't want to disturb given the problems you are having. Will you let me go or should I file a complaint for preventing... ...of completing my task for the health service? That was still missing, a complaint from you. Where are they sending you? Somewhere where you won't be. Let her go. Unity, take heed. Unit, salute. I have to do it? Yes. Last signature. Before transferring from the desk and your weapon. Hey, sergeant. Demons have attacked Zalava. Help us, we are doomed. Demons have attacked Zalava. We're possessed. Why aren't you doing anything? There is a demon in Zalava. Where are you going? Come back. We sit into trouble. We need help. What happened? Should I take him away? He wants the trouble caused solve and get a pardon. No. He goes to the doctor in Zalava. Come with me. We can handle it. You better go. Let's go back. Hurry up. Fast. This way. come. Salavans believe that demons are afraid of metal. This doesn't even scare my mother. They make more fuss every time. Guard. I will help you. This way. Come on. Guard. Go this way. Let me walk like this. It's safe. With this, the demon cannot influence you. -It is not necessary. My poor Saleh became possessed and died. I wish I was in your place had died, my darling. My son... Where are you going? Get the doctor. – My sheep have fled to the mountains. I told you that there is a demon in this house. Where are you going? Then why did we get Amardan? Why are you leaving? Don't leave the fields. The demon only comes once a year. Why are you leaving? We made it to Amardan. What more do you want? I've seen Teymour's mother. That poor child is foaming at the mouth with fear. Where are you going, honey? Is Teymour the boy who sleepwalks? Shouldn't he go to town for his nervousness? We Zalavans all sleepwalk. That comes because our ancestors were always traveling around. Why doesn't Amardan start? Everyone leaves. Start fast, Amardan. It is getting late. If the buyers discover this, they will not buy our sheep. We asked Amardan to calm everyone down. You can go. Maybe it's not a demon but is it the people of the dam. They started a rumor about demons so that they can buy our land cheaply. Which dam? If Amardan can't catch the demon, am I gone. Look. They look for an excuse to leave. Leaving... Would you pack your things and move to the city? If there's a demon, we'll catch it. The walnuts haven't even been picked yet. We have to sell the sheep. We got a bad sign. That's why the demon comes once a year. Gypsies are not supposed to be farmers. -My sheep are possessed. They all fled to the mountains. I'm ruined. Last year, in the three days that Amirza caught the demon... ...the spots on my face disappeared. You don't remember that. I looked so beautiful. Stop. Is that an exorcism? Would you like a walnut? Guns and musical instruments. Grab your gun. The musicians will come soon. Don't you have a gun? Grab your gun. Mine doesn't hit a mule yet. He does not work. No one dares to carry their gun because you are there. You did your job well, sergeant. I'll go in. Whatever you hear, whatever happens, don't let anyone go in. I will come back again. With or without the demon. When I come out alone and have nothing with me... ...then shoot me. Below my waist. Then the demon remains in me and will not control those others. If he gets scared, then stab me with this... ...so that my blood spurts out. You know what to do. Don't you feel sorry for these people? Give it to me. I will do it. Under my torso. No problem. Under your torso. I? Under the torso. Where did you stay? -I'm sorry. Shoot him. He doesn't have the demon with him. Shoot him. To shoot. Shoot him. Come on, shoot him. I've got it. I've got it. I've got it. Dance. Let the demons hear how lucky you are. Dance. Long live Amardan. Long live Amardan. Long live Amardan. The exorcist and his demon are under arrest. for what? –Scam. Amardan is decent. What did he do wrong? The court may decide whether he is decent. I didn't take any money. The village was in danger. I helped. What are you? An agent? This village has been around for over a century cursed by demons. The exorcists have always helped us, not the police. His daughter is dead because of you. If he gets caught, the exorcists stay away. Jones, get up. Sit down. – Then what should we do with the demons? Is there an exorcist at the police station? -Good idea. I'll take it. Is there a demon in this jar? Yes sir. Look at me when I talk to you. How much do you get for capturing demons? I'm not asking for money for exorcisms. Those who work for the government get paid. Name your price. It depends on the location, the time and gender of the demon. So how much are you asking for this one? Nothing, sir. How do you determine the price? Per pot? The weight of the demon? The length? Is 50 toman a fair price? No, it's not worth it. It's just a jar some smoke and some fiddling. If you add the blue substance, I would give a maximum of ten for it. Ten? With that you can chew some gum for that soldier. What are you doing? –Let him go. Don't come forward. I am here for these people. What do they know now? You are a charlatan. I'm risking my life because they need me. Do they need your trickery? Stop this nonsense. Without the exorcism, he would have been dead. –Is that why he was shot in the arm? That was a mistake. It should have been his leg. Because of this nonsense his daughter fell off the roof. Amardan is a good person. Leave him alone. Let him go. Without Amirza and Amardan no one would the villagers can calm down. Let him go. –Amardan saved my son. What do you want from him? What do you have done for us? Let him go. He deserves respect. Let him go. Okay. For your white beard and that decent lady. Well done. Your parents can be proud of you. But admit that there is no demon in this pickle jar. Then you can go. Why do you show so little respect for me and the demon? This is not a pickle jar. There is a demon that not everyone can catch. This affects me. Everyone knows that. In the winter, without help, it is life-threatening. There is a dangerous demon in this jar. I can't keep him in there much longer. It's a cruel demon, worse than any other evil. I earn my money with simple work. I'm not gonna lie to save my life. Just handcuff me. Handcuff him. If you are sure that there is no demon in the pot... ...why don't you open it? Fine. Are you here to scare us or to restore order? Do you care about these people? What if there's a small chance that there is a demon in it? Do not do it. For me. Get his things. Let's go. Let him go. Don't let the cat get to the pot. That is dangerous. The demon has not yet been fully captured. He can control the cat and cause damage. Didn't you put it in the pot? Take him. You didn't let me finish my job. The demon is more dangerous in the pot. Let me finish and then you can take me anywhere. Do it for them. They deserve security. Your last signature here. Are you happy about that? -No. What do you know about him? He worked for the construction company that worked on the dam. After his discharge he was with Amirza for a while. Amirza the exorcist. -That's his uncle. Amirza came a year and a half ago perform an exorcism in Zalava. He had a lot of knowledge. Then there were no demons until recently. Where is that Amirza now? Nobody knows. Amardan is now trusted more than Amirza. Amardan would have prevented the construction of the dam have to take revenge on the company. He is said to be the demons peed in the dam. Did they do that? I didn't see them pee, but the construction of the dam is fucked up. Sorry for my language. I'm sorry, Amanda. He shouldn't have been arrested. Surely he will know a lot because people trust him. He scared people with his tricks. They don't trust him they are afraid of him. He is said to be every demon whom he catches turns into a servant. People go to him if something needs to be done. And he helps them with his demons. So he has a legion of demons. That's a danger for national security, right? In that case, the intelligence– and security service SAVAK has already arrested him. SAVAK? What is our responsibility if we discovering that someone is cheating on people... ...without them knowing? The law is unclear about those things. And honor then? What damage does he do then? People listen to him. He gives them a pot and they calm down. The office also has something to do with that. And what if he says tomorrow that she is you have to set fire to calm them down? What do you think of that? Do you like that? He leaves. I have to from tomorrow solve the problems. Now that he has to go he makes the region unsafe... ...to show that everything was safer under his leadership. Amardan can be more useful to us when he is free. Do you understand what I mean? Amardan? Do you need something? Cigarettes or something else? I'm just a soldier. I have no power. I'll try the sergeant tomorrow to convince you to be released. He wanted to impress the doctor. He can't really do anything. Happiness belongs to the demons. They love weddings. They live for many years. What's the point of being human? I'm just a soldier. I only have three days left on duty. I would anywhere respected elsewhere in the world. People like me have special positions. They have organizations and fixed salaries. Do you know anyone at the dam construction company? Can you help me get a job there? The salary is good. I trust you and will serve you and your demons. They listen to you. Send some demons to make sure I get hired. From the day that Khalaj's daughter died... ...I prayed for 40 nights. I haven't eaten and haven't slept to catch the demon. I sense it. He's restless. Get me the pot. Then I get in trouble. Bring it here. I am not finished yet. I have to tame it. He's dangerous. Amardan... I was too scared to say it. I switched the jar with the demon. I put it in the doctor's bag. What did you say? I have the jar with the demon in the doctor's bag. Why did you do that? What have you done, asshole? Those poor people. May God save them. The pot had tonight to stay in the village. God save them. I was afraid the sergeant the jar would open. You have your life and that of the villagers destroyed. God, save the Zalavans. And that woman. Soldier? -Yes sir? Take him out and set him free. Do not eat. Send three men to Darreh–Sefid to find Amardan. Fast. Why do you keep moving the oil? Hurry up. Amardan has no fixed abode. Nobody knows where he lives. Make that way searched for Zalava. That's no use. We need to notify headquarters. If he just escaped, he can't be far away yet. Unless you know more about who released him. If I knew, I would tell. But since I'm in charge from tomorrow I must report his escape. I have until tomorrow morning. Let's go. I wanted to be flawless but finish reprehensible. You've been reprehensible from the start. Come with me. I have three more days. Let me stay here. No. Come with me. I go to the road towards Zalava. I'm shaking all over. I really can't drive. What should I do with the rabbit? If I release him, he dies. Sir. I'm sorry. Let's not go to the village. I did something bad. I have the jar with the demon in it in the doctor's bag. I was afraid to take it with me. Since he has not been tamed, the demon will according to Amardan when he comes out of the pot... ...destroy everyone. I had no idea. Did you leave the jar with the doctor? -Yes. come. Let's get it. You said demons don't exist, right? You said that Amardan was an impostor, not an exorcist. So it's stuck nothing dangerous in that jar. But now you want to go find him? What are you doing to me? What if there's a demon in that jar? What will happen to those people then? You mean Miss Maliheh. I'd rather go in service longer than I'm coming along. I'd rather die than get possessed. I can still see Khalaj's daughter. She was so beautiful. I'm going to look around. -Come on, don't go. These rabbits are so beautiful. Did you catch them alive? Yes. Our guns don't work. I don't know what's wrong with it. Poor animals. Please, doctor. -Thank you. Good night. Is there something wrong? No. I only heard that there is a demon whether a ghost has been seen in the village. Have you seen one? Ghosts only seek pregnant women. What's this joke? I was worried about you. -Why? Amardan has escaped. -Really and truly? Are you happy about that? Yes and no. I'm happy because you you have received what you deserve. And then why are you sad? –Because you got your comeuppance. I have terrible stomach ache. Do you have any medicine for this lonely sergeant? Why is there no end to those tests of yours? You're just blood and urine put in jars. I had the samples sent to headquarters... ...but there was a problem with those from Zalava. There was too much adrenaline in their blood. They think I made a mistake. What is Adrenaline? – Anxiety and stress increase adrenaline. Maybe you are the problem. The tests were from the day their weapons were taken and the girl died. I wanted to avoid them on each other would shoot for fear of demons. They know what to do against demons. Khalaj wanted to stab his daughter to exorcise the demon. It's not my fault she got scared and fell off the roof. Or does that make me a murderer? Is that what you think? No. But if they'd had their guns, they just shot her in the leg. Can't believe you say that. Do you believe that nonsense? A boy lost his leg because of it. They need to change their beliefs. -At least he's alive. I've tried to change them. That they bring their blood and urine samples is good enough for me. Some things do not change. You have to accept them. Don't know. Maybe they will change with time. Maybe they started telling stories... ...about demons around the gendarmes and deter forest rangers. So they can hunt illegally without having to worry. Do you have a spoon? Isn't it better when it's dark? No. Aren't you leaving? You have not taken the medicine. Apparently your stomach ache is gone. No, it's not gone. Maliheh. I think my adrenaline increased tonight. I have tonight opened the jar with the demon inside. Why did you do that? Don't know. I've never been so scared for something stupid. In that moment of fear I realized how lonely I am. And then I heard that Younes has hidden the demon pot somewhere... ...in the village and another pot brought to the office. Is the demon jar still somewhere in the village? I heard noises tonight. Demons don't exist. It's all cheating. Then why were you so scared? Maybe you are possessed. Are you afraid of me now? Don't know. I have a strange feeling this evening. If I'm afraid of an empty pickle jar, can you be afraid of me. No. I'm not afraid of you. I'm afraid of the demon. A little then. But if you think you're possessed by the demon, you must leave. You've had your medicine. Are you going to send me away too? When I was born... ...I had an extra finger here. They called me Six Finger... ...and the children in the orphanage didn't want to play with me. One day a young couple came to adopt a child. They loved me very much. I was so happy. That first night... Then the young woman's mother my hand saw... ...she said, 'An extra finger is a sign from the devil.' It was a bad omen and they had to bring me back. The young couple was so scared that they gave me the locked in the stable all night. I was shaking with cold and fear. In the morning they brought me back to the orphanage. I felt belittled. I didn't want to have any more family. Maliheh, superstitious people not only harm themselves. They are dangerous to everyone. Fear can destroy people. Their past and their future. I came back for the villagers. For you. You don't have to issue a manifesto. Let me see. What happened next? I took care of it and left me alone... ...and as I got older, went away slowly. What are you doing here? I've come to bring urine for the doctor. Isn't that allowed or what? What are you doing here? I've said he always does may bring. But why so late? By the demon I couldn't pee for fear. It took a while before I could do it again. Please. Why is it in this jar? – Yours was too small. Maybe you need something extra, I thought. Where is Amardan? Amardan? You took him. Why are you asking me that? Go home. Don't say anything about what you saw here. Don't look at him like that. It is said that he shot 20 people has to free them from demons. Do Zalavas have this from birth? Or is it because of their fear of demons? Their adrenaline rises and falls, what causes problems for you. They want the spots on their face disappear and their hair does not turn white. They don't care or a doctor or an exorcist will take care of it. It surprises me that you told something about yourself. We may never see each other again. In the orphanage we didn't learn... ...how to say that you like someone. You shouldn't say that you like them. What should I say? You must say, "I love you." I love you. The Demon... I have to take these away. Headquarters will send a car. I'll bring you. Guard. Wait a second. What are you doing? We need the demon stop with fire. Where's your weapon? The demon is not in the pot. I saw him in the alley. Why are you setting this building on fire? -Shut up. What you saw was the shadow of the demon. If we destroy the pot, the demon will also be destroyed. We can ask if Amardan is released so that he can catch it. Amardan has escaped. One two Three. Villagers, the demon is in the clinic. Women and children must stay indoors. Every family must send a man to help catch the demon. Don't come near from the doctor's house. Women and children must stay indoors. Every family must send a man to help. Villagers, the demon is in the clinic. Do not move. Backwards. -Stay there. Stop. You are possessed. -Shoot him. He's possessed. Shoot him. –What's up now? You are possessed. -Stop. Stop this nonsense. What a load of shit. –Take another step and I'll shoot. Guard. You are being executed when you shoot a cop. I do that for these people. Calm down. Which demon? I was alone with the doctor. No. The demon was there too when you made love. Amousa, we must kill them or set on fire? Then they will slowly die. -So what? They are not humans, but demons. –You belong in jail, you crazy people. I'll give the pot. Do what you want with it. Would you set the government clinic on fire? What does it matter that it belongs to the government? Notify the agency. Are you deaf or something? Show mercy. Let's kill them first and then burn them. Don't let them suffer in the fire. We don't have to kill them. We shoot below their waist and let their blood spurt out. Even if we do, we still have need an exorcist to capture the demon. When he comes, he will be arrested. They will die if they bleed for a few days. My sister was bleeding so much before the exorcist came she died. There are too few exorcists in this area. Your sister died in childbirth. That had nothing to do with a demon. Not true. She was possessed. She couldn't be helped. –Do you want to kill us? Rather that than a demon takes possession of our children. I'm sorry. Forgive me, Maliheh. Release your weapons. –The demon is not here. It is too early. Sergeant, you're in charge here. Tell them to shoot you so they know you're not possessed. But instead you draw your gun? How many people do you want to kill? -Do not be afraid. They're going to shoot a few times. Should I shoot or are we going to burn this place down? That will kill them. Forgive me. Amardan. Amanda is here. Welcome. Be welcome. Just in time. Welcome, Amanda. Welcome, Amanda. We know that you wouldn't let us down. Welcome. You're back, exorcist. I have enough credit for these people not to abandon with the demon. He's fine. He can go. This has been your salvation. Oh no. She's possessed. I hope the demon not too deep in her soul. But I feel fine. Amardan. Massoud. What kind of exorcist are you? You don't even know where the demons are. If I could have finished my work... ...would the villagers and this girl be alright. Amardan is in there. -What are you doing? Not sure if I caught it. That's Alatif's urine sample. If we survive this I will give you my urine. Stop that fiddling. Go calm them down. –Do you want me to finish what you started? If I leave without a demon, they'll kill me. —That's what you deserve, charlatan. They're expecting a demon. I feel nothing. I don't know if he's in it. Then what should we do? They could set this building on fire. Say the demon is in the jar. And if not? Then they'll never trust exorcists again. Are you worried about your boyfriends? Let me go. Then tell me there's a demon in it. Do you want me to go say in my uniform that there's a demon in here? Oh, so you're worried about your uniform. asshole. You called me an asshole. Stop. Let him go. You kill him. Stop. Let him go. Guard. The demon is in here. Amardan put it in the pot. Stop. Stand there. Take it easy. Believe me. The demon is in here. Where is Amardan? -Inside. He can't come. You wanted the demon, didn't you? Here it is. We don't believe you. Amardan has to say it himself. Did you kill him? -He's alive. He is inside. Amardan. Amardan, are you still alive? Why are not you saying anything? They killed him. –Did you kill him, Maliheh? Take it easy. Lower the gun or I'll shoot. I swear on my daughter's soul. Don't point your gun at the sergeant. Do not do it. Okay. Take it easy. Listen, you know that my job here is done. Kick it forward. If I didn't care about your safety, I wouldn't be here. I have the jar. Let the doctor go. I'll stay here with the pot and Amardan, as long as you want. Walk away slowly. –Massoud. Do not worry. Just go. Stand there. Amardan, aren't you going to do anything? Oh my God. Amardan. -Shoot him. Why do you keep saying that? There's a demon in this jar. Why are you afraid of this nonsense? Amardan does something inside so that the demons never come back. Why isn't he coming out? Amardan. Amardan. He can't come. Amardan. Come outside. Amardan. Come and tell them that you caught the demon. Maliheh's eyes are similar to those of Khalaj's daughter when she was possessed. Please kill them. My eyes? –They will ruin us. Shoot them. Why don't you shoot, Amousa? –Assad, why don't you shoot? Calm. The demon is in the jar. You said the demon is in the jar. Throw it to see if it breaks. What are you waiting for? Throw it. No. Higher. Can't we catch the demon otherwise? Should we shoot their legs? Sergeant, step aside. Have them shoot the doctor's leg. -Shut up, Younes. Do you think I'm possessed? Then shoot. Do it. –The sergeant is also possessed. Just shoot. We dare our sheep not to graze. You are all crazy. Go to hell. Shoot me first. Arahim, do it. Let the young people do it. If I shoot Maliheh, will she get mad at me. She should be thankful to you that you drive the demon away. But we are friends. I can't anymore. Even in Nourabad they don't do it that way anymore. Nobody does it like that. Don't shoot them. The young people don't have the guts. Why don't you do it yourself? Lower your gun, idiot. You're supposed to shoot our legs. I will do it. No problem. I'll aim for your ankle. There's no blood there. Aim at his thigh to make blood squirt out. Your weapons are malfunctioning. Be careful with the sergeant. Jones, do it. Use my weapon. If you shoot a cop, you will be executed. Do it. You all saw that he said we should do it. We will prepare a statement. The sergeant is honorable and get shot... ...to free the people from the demon. Bravo. You know that I have nothing against the government. Long live the king. What? What do you mean? Where? Get away from me. Go in as soon as they fire. Do not be afraid. Go to the back. There's no bullet in it. Maliheh. Maliheh. He didn't catch the demon. –He has it. Not sure if I caught it. He says he's not sure. He told us to shoot him. -To shoot. How can we shoot Amardan? –I'm not sure I caught it. I can't shoot Amardan. Not sure if I caught it. I'm not sure if I have it. I'm here to help you. Younes. Sergeant. I may have caught it. Sergeant. I may have caught it. If I kill you, you'll be a hero. Under your torso. The demon has been overpowered. Be happy.
