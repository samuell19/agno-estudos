Months before the murder, that ladder had been there Even that has not been torn or displaced So the statement that he saw the accused walking away with the ladder Why is the easiest way being avoided by the Crime Branch? Entry can be without force Sir, the evidence forthat theory is along with that.. This is the list of calls that came to 9847413144, Chembakkammal's number Those three were from her cousin Anandam 08122992328 Who happens to be Chembakkammmal's native.

Chembakkammal leaving Pandipuram village in Thirunelveli, 30 years before, Was the outcome of herfalling in love outside her caste The revenge sequences still continue even afterthree decades There is a greater possibility ofthis murder falling into that murder series. is what! intended to remind by presenting these evidences. My old Assistant... She knows there is no chance The accused, under lPC sections 450, 397, 302 and 201 Just to satisfy the ego of the police orthe politician An innocent young man was trapped by the Police Please.. lfthe accused wishes to say anything, he may. I didn't murder Chembakkammal. This case is posted to 28th ofthis month for orders Hanna, I realize that you are good at creating stories, But all that will not work with Judge Jayadevan Forthat first thing needed is veneration for teacher Don't think like that, Ajayan Even ifl lose, at least someone spoke for me. Moving to another news 2015 June in Vaikkom, a lady staying alone was murdered in the night After the failure for over an year of the local police to arrest the culprit Crime branch created an elaborate and scientific investigation in the Chembakkammal case The arrest of the accused in the Chembakkammal murder is a win for the people Crime branch took on the case and arrested the accused. Under lPC Section 450, 397, 302, 201 the court is convinced that the accused has not committed any crime Hence under Cr PC 235 Clause 1 the accused has been acquitted 12th Witness Cl Simon George has committed serious human rights violation To find out the actual killers of Chem bakkammal And ifthat is not possible, this Court recommends it may be handed over to any other agency. The 11th witness Cl Praveen Kumar's criminal negligence has been established Because they must be trained to face the worst situations Hanna's win is logically my win too Whenl leftyour office, I had only one desire I will be a better human being 2018 OCTOBER You must forgive me.. that l was here at that time "When fingertips and finger tips kiss each other" "The flapping of wings is silent" "In the stream when a heart flows into a heart" "Which sound can win over this silence.."
