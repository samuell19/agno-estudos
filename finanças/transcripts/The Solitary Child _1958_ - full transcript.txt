[dramatic orchestral music] [joyful music] Who is it today? Film stars? Captain Random. That shooting business last year on the farm down in Dorset. Remember? Oh, yeah. Getting married again, huh? Yes, it is him, Cath. I asked the chappy over there. It's Captain Random that shot his wife. You have no right to say that, Winnie. He got off, didn't he? Yes, but only because they couldn't prove it. - I'd like a word with Mrs. Random. - Must you? Mrs. Random, you were a West End model before your marriage, is that right? Yes, but I've given it up now, of course. You've got your photographs, now buzz off. My paper is interested in the second Mrs. Random, seeing what happened to the first. What the devil do you mean by that? Will you be living in Random End farm in spite of its associations? I refuse to answer you. Did you know Mr. Random at the time of his trial? Don't answer him, darling. Did you meet his first wife? Come on. Give us a minute, Mr. Random. [soft music] Oh, welcome home! Hello, Ann. - This is Harriet. - How do you do? Did James tell you he had a sister practically living on your doorstep? Yes. I pointed out your cottage as we came up the drive. I've heard so much about you. You must be tired. We are a bit. It was a long drive from the airport. I ordered dinner for 8:30. Is that all right for you? Well, of course. It's awfully nice of you to arrange everything for us. See Harriet upstairs, I'll go and put the car away and bring in the rest of the luggage. [mysterious music] Here you are. Thank you. This is wonderful. This used to be the guest room. James asked me to get it ready for you. They... Er... He used to use the rooms on the other side of the house, before. Yes, I see. You can talk about it, you know. I'm not embarrassed or anything. Aren't you? Look, I don't want to seem horribly patronising, but I do hope you know this is your home. I mean, just because I've come... Well, I know your mother left this house to James and you. James told me all about it. That's very sweet of you, but I'm quite happy at the cottage. You can't split up a farm. You'll be meeting one of your neighbours later. Cyril Sully. He's the vet. He's coming over to see one of the mares. Yes. James told me about him too. Why don't you both stay to dinner? But you don't want us here on your first evening home? Please stay. It would be nice. That's very kind of you. If James doesn't mind. I'm sure he won't. All right. I'll go and phone Cyril. Leave you to unpack. Good. Do you want to come for dinner or not? She's asked you. All right. Mmh? Of course, you don't have to dress up. Don't be so silly. As a matter of fact, she's very nice and very pretty. Oh, really? You can go around to the stables after dinner. [chuckles] Okay. [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [lullaby] [cuckoo clock] I was looking for the bathroom. It's the other way, next to your bedroom. Thanks. It's sad, isn't it? A deserted nursery is always rather sad. Yes. She's still with her grandparents, isn't she? Yes. Ever since... Ever since Eva died, James sent her away. - I've never seen Maggie. - Oh? She was sixteen last birthday. She's an odd child. Very artistic. She draws rather well. I think it's very brave of you to come here with James. I'm not afraid of what people say. That's a good start anyway. There's one thing about being a horse doctor. Your patients can't sue you if you make a mistake. Cyril, don't you think you've had enough? I don't use your women's institute for us, my dear. I understand you look after Ann's box of puppies. I'm longing to see them. So you shall. - I suppose you sell them. - Oh, yes. I could never possibly afford the cottage without my dog breeding business. It's quite profitable. And maybe one day, your sister-in-law will condescend to marry a horse doctor. Well, if you're going to see that mare, don't you think... All right, James, I can take a hint. I'll come out in a minute. I think I'll go and get a wrap. It's getting rather chilly. She was asking about Maggie. Well, what about it? Why can't she come home where she belongs? Ann, I don't want to go into all that again just now. At the time, it might have been a necessary cruelty. Now, it's positively inhuman. I sent Maggie to her grandmother's because it was the only thing to do. And it still is. You sent her there because you couldn't bear the sight of her. All the more reason why she should be with somebody who loves her and wants her. But she adored you, trusted you! And you shut her out of your life completely! You got rid of her because she reminded you of her mother, no other reason. That's what the neighbours think, isn't it? "It wasn't enough proof to convict him, but no wonder he doesn't want to see his daughter!" "She's so like her poor mother." "It would be like living with the dead!" Why do you hate everyone so? You kill love, trust... Oh, Harriet. I'm so sorry, darling. I'd better go and see how Cyril's getting on. If you don't mind, I shall pop down and see how's Mrs. Banks. She's been ill. Darling, don't be long. Of course I won't be. He makes things so much worse for himself. He invites suffering. In fact, he provokes it. Can't you understand why? He's been unhappy for so long. I wasn't thinking of him. I was thinking of Maggie. Her mother brought her up lavishing things on one moment, and screaming at her the next. James was the one rock in that child's life. That's why I can't forgive him for sending her away. I expect he had his reasons. I expect he did. - [honking] - Oh! That's Cyril. I'd better be off. James won't be long. It's only about a mile to the lodge. Hope you'll settle in all right. - Good night. - Good night. [intriguing music] [mild thuds] [squeaking] [mewing] [clank] [suspenseful music] Oh! Who are you? I'm Maggie. You gave me quite a fright. I'm sorry. I was hungry. Helped myself to some bread and jam. Hope you don't mind. You're my new step-mother. Yes, but you must call me Harriet. Thank you, Harriet. I hate calling people just you. Why aren't you with your grandparents? I ran away. Don't send me back! Maggie, they'll be worried to death about you! - I left a note. - All the same. I must telephone them and tell them you're here. I heard Daddy coming up the drive, so I hid in the bushes. I was afraid he'd send me back. I suppose he'll be furious and I don't blame him. Oh, what a nuisance! What's the matter? I fused all the lights in the hall. Wait here. I'm like a cat in the dark. This phone has yards to flex. I'll bring it into the light. - Shall I get to for you? - Yes, please. West Bradley, two, four, one, please. You'd better do this. Hello. This is Mrs. Random. Is Mrs. Tenby there? In bed? Oh, I see. No, don't disturb them. Just tell them that Miss Maggie has come home. Yes, here at Random End. Oh no, there's nothing to worry about. Yes. Thank you very much. Good night. Please, make Daddy let me stay. I'm sure he'll do what you ask. I'll help you in the house and on the farm. Don't send me back. - Maggie. - I've hated not being at home. - Do you think you'll like me? - Of course I shall. Then you're on my side. Yes, I'm on your side. It's a pity you couldn't have come here by bus tomorrow instead of creeping out at night like this. I know, I'm sorry. I get carried away. What can you expect? You see, I'm backward. Oh, nonsense! I am definitely! Granny sends me to a headshrinker. - A what? - A psychiatrist. I've never been to a psychiatrist. It's quite fun, like a game. But you must never let them know what you really think. Well, come on, let's go and find you somewhere to sleep. [dramatic music] - Maggie! - Hello, Daddy. What are you doing here? Well, now she's here, James. Hadn't she better stay? We'll discuss that in the morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. You must be Mrs. Evans. That's right. I expect Miss Ann has told you where everything is. I've been keeping eggs, and poultry, and the dairy. - Shall I clear it out? - No. Ought I to help with the eggs and things? You can take over the poultry if you like, Madam. But I've never had any complaints. And I've never grudged the hard work. Oh, I see. Perhaps it isn't my job. Morning, Harriet. Hello, Mrs. Evans. I met the postman. Came to see if I could do anything. James's somewhere on the farm, I think. And Maggie? - Oh, you've heard? - Yes, I've heard. She's still asleep. James hasn't said anything about her this morning. He seems rather worried. He's rather different from the days I knew him in London. Still I'm beginning to feel quite at home already. - What's the matter? - What? Nothing. Look, why don't you leave James and Maggie to work out their problem? Come and spend the day at the cottage, see the puppies. Thanks, but another time. I'd rather stay here. All right. I just thought I'd like to ask. Well, I go back now. It always makes things worse if I'm around. Would you mind if I asked Mrs. Evans for some eggs? Of course not. Take as many as you like. Thanks. It helps so much. - Hello. - Morning, Harriet. Don't forget, you're on my side. - And don't be frightened of Daddy. - All right. I thought I'd go and have a look around. - Do you want to come? - Yes, please! - [mooing] - [cackling] [neighing] Thank you. Who's that? That's Jean. She works on the farm. Come on, I'll introduce you. - Hello, Jean. - Maggie! This is my new step-mother. How do you do? I won't shake hands. I'm covered in oil. - Oh. - When did you get back? Last night. I'm going to stay here, now. That's good. Do excuse me, I've got masses to do. Of course. Hello, Daddy. Run along, Maggie. I want to talk to Harriet privately. If it's about sending me back to Granny's, Harriet says it's all right and I can stay. - I didn't say that-- - If you send me back, I'll kill myself! I'll jump out of a window! Maggie, run indoors. - But, Daddy-- - Go up to your room and stay there! [dramatic music] James! James. What's the child done to deserve this? She knew we were coming down here last night. She was only curious. Harriet, I really can't discuss Maggie now. What's the harm in her staying? I simply can't explain, but you must trust me. You must believe me when I tell you that it wouldn't be good for her to stay. I'm going to talk to her now. No. Just leave it to me. [knocking] Oh, I'm sorry. - Did you warn Mr. Random? - Yes, I did. - Come in, won't you? - Thank you. He's just gone upstairs. He won't be a moment. Is there anything I can do? I'm afraid I don't know much about farming. Well, I was going to ask James if I could borrow the Shooting Brake. I'm sure I can say yes to that. That's very kind of you. We can't afford a car. My mother's got to go the dentist. Oh, I see. She's very anxious to meet you some time. I'd love to meet her. Perhaps you bring her up here and we'll have tea. Then I'll show her the house and the garden. She knows the house inside out and the garden. She'd like to meet you. Oh. Please, take the Shooting Brake. I'll tell my husband. Thanks. [door closes] [engine revving] Well? It's all right. I've said she can stay. You'd better go up and see her. She wants to talk to you. Don't be angry. Please, don't be angry. - I'm not angry-- - I'm sorry. Daddy didn't allow me to stay because I lied and said you've promised. - It wasn't that. - What then? It was because of something else I told him. Oh. I told him I wouldn't tell you. Then you'd better not. But you'd like to know, wouldn't you? Not if it's private. But I want to tell you. I'd feel so much better if I told you. Then you'll just have to suffer. It's high time you learn to keep a promise. If that sounded step-motherly and stuffy, you asked for it. - What're you drawing? - None of your business. There's no need to sulk. I didn't mean to interfere. I was just interested. You're nice to me, aren't you, Harriet? I didn't mean to sulk. You can look at the drawing if you like. Are you angry? Of course not. Hadn't we better go down to lunch? You go. I shan't have any lunch. [chuckles] [mysterious music] Oh, Harriet. You wanted some vegetables for the house. These should last you off the weekend. Thank you. I'm sure they will. I've let you in for an ordeal this morning. - Oh? - I've taken you at your word. My mother's calling. - She's coming up for coffee. - Good! Don't let her weary you. She's a snob and a gossiper. Jean, how dare you say that? You should never even think things like that about your own mother. I'll take these into the dairy. I'm sorry about Maggie. Please, don't apologise for her. I've known her since she was a child. Anyway, she's much improved since you came. Besides, poor girl, I happen to know she hated her own mother. Which reminds me, do you think I can borrow the Shooting Brake again to get my mother? - Of course. - Thanks. Hello, Ann. Is Uncle Cyril asking you to marry him? You again, you monster! I want to see that husband of yours. I hear he's having some trouble with his pigs. He's putting the milk through the cooler. Good. Then I'll go and have a word with him. Is Mrs. Evans about? No. She went down to the village. Oh! I was wondering if you could let me have some more eggs. I'll get them for you. Have you got a basket? - In the car. - How many? Well, a dozen. - Bring two dozen. - Okay. - Are you sure you can spare them? - Of course. I'm sorry Maggie was teasing you. Oh, I'm glad in a way. It's nice to see her normal, cheeky and happy like she used to be. Besides, she's fetching my eggs for me. I suppose that was her way of apologising. You're very good with her. She's certainly looking great these days. Even if her sweater is on back to front. I wish she got on better with James. Is he being bullying her? No. They hardly ever speak to each other. Maggie doesn't seem to notice. She's out of touch with the ordinary world. - They're usually like that? - Who? I don't know. I don't suppose I know much about children. Stay and have some coffee. Help me with Mrs. Dennison. All right. Yes, Marr Dennison is a scourge, all right. But once she's seeing you, she can't say too many outrageous things about you. Don't worry. I'll be on my best behaviour. You know, Mrs. Random, everyone in the county is dying to meet you. We're all so fond of your husband and he's got such a ghastly time. When it happened, there wasn't a voice in the district raised against him. Not a voice! Could I have some more coffee, Harriet? And now, we're all so glad for him. After long years of misery being married to a charming girl like you, it must be like living in a different world. Oh... But perhaps, I'm being curious and you'd rather not talk about it. But I'm sure you're one of those people who'd rather discuss a thing frankly and openly. Personally, I have no time for small talk and idle chatter. Idle chatter, did you say, Mother? That's rich! I think we're all wrong to try and avoid mentioning what happened. Exactly, my dear. It was an accident. Jean said so at the time. Didn't you, Jean? I've always disliked guns, especially shotguns. So liable to go off at the wrong time. What I really wanted to say, Mrs. Random, was that we're all on your side. The whole county, I mean. We all admire you so much. And I want you to remember that you can count on me. Thank you. More coffee? Yes, please. Mrs. Dennison, I thought I might save Jean a journey and take you home down to the village. Don't bother. I've got it all arranged. But really, Mother, it's very kind of Ann and I haven't got time! My dear, I shouldn't dream of dragging you away from your delicious manure or whatever you're working on. Archie will pick me up. He's coming for the weekend. Archie's coming here? Mrs. Dennison! Archie is my son. Harriet doesn't know. It's all right. James told me. Archie was the other man in the case. Eva led him on, my dear. He was hardly to blame. - He was a little more than a child. - [Ann] That's not the point! You have no right to bring him here! Isn't about time that we let bygones be bygones? It's about time we went home. With any luck, we'll be able to stop Archie before he comes up the drive. Please, don't make this fuss for my sake. I don't mind meeting him. It's not you, Harriet. It's what James will say. Perhaps we had better be going. Thank you for the coffee, Mrs. Random. I've been so glad at this chance of a little chat with you. Jean, you could drive your mother home. - Take the Shooting Brake again. - Thank you. You must come and have tea with me some time. - Goodbye, Mrs. Random. - Goodbye. What a woman! I'm sorry, Harriet. I've always treated her as rather a joke, but she's not. She's monstrous. I asked Jean to take her mother home so you could stay to lunch. Oh! I'd like to, but I've asked Cyril to lunch with me. That's fine. Cyril is here already. You can both stay. Well, no. I'd rather not. It's James. He wouldn't like it. He's been so cold to Cyril these days. You'd never think they've been brought up together, practically as brothers. - But surely-- - No, really. I'd rather not. [mysterious music] - Ann? - Mmh? Here. Take this. It's a chicken. Since you and Cyril won't stay, you might as well eat it at home. Oh, Harriet. That's sweet of you. Thank you. Don't you worry about what Mrs. Dennison said. She's a silly, spiteful woman. Ann? Was there really anything between Archie and Eva? Yes, there was. He was always hanging around the farm on his vacations from Oxford. He was only a boy. Rather charming, frank and open. I never suspected, but... apparently, it was common knowledge. He was here the afternoon Eva was killed. James had to admit in court that he'd seen him near the house. I suppose James knew all along. Or perhaps he had only just found out. Anyway, seeing Archie here that afternoon must have... It must have been the last straw. What do you mean, the last straw? Is it better for you to know, or worse? What are you trying to say? James has always been a very upright, honest sort of person. When we were kids, I used to think he was a prick. He sets up himself to such a high standard. He has a great integrity. So when the break came with Eva, it must have been... much worse for him than for... any ordinary person. I never dreamed he was capable of such a thing. But he did it. - He shot her. - He was acquitted! You don't know the length that woman drove him to! No, it's not true! Sorry, I shouldn't have told you. You can't possibly know. You have no proof! - Cyril told me. He knows. - How? I don't know. But I'm afraid he's certain. Now you hate me for telling you. I hated Cyril when he told me. It made things easier in the long run. How can you expect me to believe such a vile lie, Ann? If James had been found guilty, Cyril would have had everything to gain, wouldn't he? Why do you think he wanted to marry you? Because he wanted the farm! That's why. It's true, isn't it? That's why you won't marry him. Because you know he lied to you about James! And you know why he lied! Hello. I just came to collect my mother. The new Mrs. Random, I presume? You must be, because I'm sure you're not an employee. My sister Jean told me all about you. Well, well! James certainly knows how to pick'em. How dare you come here? I can see you know all about me, Mrs. Random. Your mother's left. I know. I passed them on the road. Then why did you come here? Curiosity. After all, I did know your predecessor rather well. Did they tell you I'm the black sheep of the family? The Dennison family has always produced one black sheep to each generation. That's probably why we no longer own this place. We used to. Did you know? No, I didn't. Is there anything else you want to tell me? Yes. Get away from this place quick. And don't believe anything my mother says to you. It wasn't an accident. And it wasn't suicide either. Somebody shot Eva. Get away from here before somebody shoots you. Are you insinuating that my husband... I'm not insinuating anything at all. I didn't say who killed Eva. I don't know who killed Eva. I only know she's dead. [engine revving] - You'd better go now. - Very well. Goodbye, Mrs. Random. I thought I told you not to come here again. I was just paying a social call on your new wife. - Get out. - Why? Are you afraid of losing her too? Nice husband you've got, Mrs. Random. Why don't you hop it? Sorry about that, darling, but don't let it worry you. We have some trouble on our hands. I must report it to the police. Police? Don't be alarmed. He's not to give himself out for common assault. The pigs have got swine fever, I fear. They all have to be shot. Lucky James, he can keep many. Did you hear what I said? Isn't Ann expecting you for lunch? Daddy, please, let me talk about it to Harriet. I absolutely forbid you to tell anyone. Do you understand? I don't mean to tell her everything. Just talk about it. I like Harriet. She's your wife and you love her... You're not to tell anybody, not even Harriet. Is that the police? This is James Random speaking. I'd like you to send up somebody this afternoon to witness an execution. Yes, several pigs. I'm afraid they have swine fever. Go up to your room and finish your French translation. What? No, I don't mind if it's Constable Earn. All right. About 3:30. Fine. Goodbye. That police sergeant was being most tactful. If I had anything against poor Constable Earn... I'm sure he didn't want to arrest me. James, I've heard so much about Eva's death especially today. Couldn't you tell me more about it? There's no point in going over old ground. - Please. - Could only lead to further unhappiness. Nothing could be worse than bottling it up like this. What do you want me to do? Run Eva down now that she's dead? Why don't you trust me? Sounds easy, doesn't it? - Well, isn't it? - Yes. - But I'd rather know. - No. I must go and see those pigs before lunch. Lunch! Dear, I'm a bad housewife. I haven't complained yet, have I? Soon will. I've given our lunch to your sister. So today, it'll be tinned ham again. [he laughs] Our brains are like wireless sets. Full of tiny valves and wires. They keep sending each other messages which we can't hear with our ears. We hear them inside our heads. But then just like real radios, we get interference. A horrid crackling noise behind our eyes. We can't understand a thing. That's enough of that nonsense. Just get on with your lunch. It isn't nonsense! Mummy told me. Finish your lunch and go up to your room. She was only trying to make conversation, you know. Besides, it was a rather clear idea. That child has far too much imagination. She's always making things up. Maggie isn't a liar. You can get yourself to believe almost anybody, except me, can't you? You tell me so little, James. I haven't got much to believe. [door closes] - I'll wash those up for you. - Thank you. I'll clear away. Where's Maggie? She ought to be helping you. I expect she's in her room. Harriet. Oh. What is it, Maggie? Do you know? I think Daddy hates me! Nonsense. If he's a little strict with you, it's for your own good. I'm unhappy here, now. So unhappy. And I thought I wouldn't be. Would you rather go back to your grandparents for a while? No, don't send me back there. I've just got to stay here. - Why? - I can't tell you. It's part of what I promised Daddy not to talk about. Look, Maggie, I'm sorry I scolded you when you tried to tell me. No. You were right. Sometimes, promises have to be broken. Perhaps you should tell me all about it. No, I can't. Not because of my promise. It's all so horrible. I just can't tell you. What were you drawing? Won't you show it to me? Come on, Maggie, please, come on. [shooting] They're shooting pigs. Isn't it a shame? Oh, yes, I was forgetting about that. You were there, weren't you? You saw it, didn't you? You must have been there. What made you do this drawing? - Answer me! - No, I can't. Mrs. Evans? Was Maggie in the house when her mother died? Oh no. Her mother had sent her to Bladen's farm, to fetch some duck eggs for setting. Sure she couldn't have seen what happened. Quite certain. It's a good four miles walk. And she arrived there on time. Mavis the keeper told me. He'd been sent after her to ask them if they've let her stay the night. This was no place for a child. Not with her mother lying dead in the stable yard. I'm sorry. James sent me to get some beer for the grave diggers and Constable Earn. Where are they burying the pigs? In the Seven Acre? Yes. They killed half already. I'll bring the beer out in a minute. I expect you want to get back. Yes, I do. I was going to ask you to, but you look rather tired. There's nothing the matter with me. Just a bit lazy, that's all. - I'll get it. - Thanks. When she first came here, I thought she was a brazen hussy and didn't care what people thought. She seems nice. I blamed her for bringing Mr. James back. Now, I'm not so sure. I'm inclined to blame him. I really don't see that you blame anybody. The main thing is he's here. And we all ought to be grateful for that. [mysterious music] You ought to get away from this place. Miss Maggie, run the beer down to the Seven Acre. Okay. If I was you, I'd pack my bags and go straight back to London. It was an accident. - Funny... somebody else said... - Said what? Nothing. You get away before you run into any more accidents. Accidents kept happening to the first Mrs. Random too, poor body. She was scared stiff. Here. Come along and lie down a while. I'll take you upstairs. I'm not surprised you feel a bit shaky. Delayed shock, I expect. I'm all right, now. Maggie, please, go and tidy yourself up. - It's nearly supper time. - Okay. What nonsense you're talking, Harriet? Of course, it was an accident. I hope you're right. It did look odd to me the way that plough was propped up. Who do you think propped it up? The shock's making you imagine things. I must say, I find it hard to explain. James wouldn't be so careless, nor would any of the men. Then who would? Nobody who knows anything about farming could have left a plough propped up like that. I must be getting back to the dairy. There are still masses of eggs waiting to be packed. Thanks for the sherry. Don't listen to her. Farming people are just as careless as anybody else. It was an accident, all right. Harriet? I feel awfully badly about this morning. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry I said such horrible things to you about Cyril. I was just hitting back at you for what you said about James. I'm sure Cyril is a very nice person. You know he wants to marry me. Of course you do. Everybody knows. I wanted to ask you. Do you think I should? - Well, Ann, I... - Sorry, that's a silly question. It's just that... I'd like to get married. There's a sort of cloud hanging over this place. Oh, well! I'll go and see about supper. [James] Harriet! [suspenseful music] [James] Harriet! Harriet! Just coming. James, where are you? [screaming] [James] Harriet! Where are you? - Put the lights on quickly! - What happened? - Are you all right? - Put the lights on! The fuse must have blown. Somebody's playing the fool. The main switch was turning off. Harriet! I lost my balance. I fell down the stairs. You're sure you're not hurt? No. I'm all right. Can we get you anything? Some brandy? No. Thank you. I think it would be better if you two went home. Yes, all right. Good night, Harriet. Take things easy. Make Maggie do some work. - I'll give you a lift to the village. - Thanks. Good night. James? It wasn't an accident. Somebody pushed me. No. Who on earth would want to do that? Why did you call me just now? You know, I can't remember. But does it matter? Why don't you go up to bed and I'll bring you some supper? Oh, Maggie! I was changing. What happened? Harriet fell downstairs, that's all. She's a bit shaken. Oh, by the way... I've had this in my pocket for you ever since the post came. James! Come here a moment! What's the matter? [ominous music] You look as if you've seen a ghost. I... I don't feel well... You'd better get a doctor. What you need is a good night sleep. Just get me a doctor, that's all I ask! Get me 40-4-3, please. [creaking] [ominous music] You dropped your scarf on the stairs. Dr. Cole advised me to put you to bed with a hot drink. And an aspirin. He'll be around in the morning. I do think he might have come tonight. I want him now! I'm sorry. I'm a bit hysterical. Now, listen, darling. Why are you so afraid of me? Sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me. Just try and relax. There's no temperature. There's nothing to worry about. I'll give her a tonic. - Thank you, Maggie. - I'll take it upstairs. - Morning, Maggie. - Morning. Darling, I've talked to the cattle sales. There's a postcard from your mother. She wants to come down for the weekend. I never thought she'd want to come. Wouldn't be wiser to ask her to wait until it's a bit warmer? Don't you want her here? Of course I do. But I just thought it might be better to wait a while until you're a little fitter. I want to see her now. Of course, darling. I didn't realise that it meant quite so much to you. Harriet, wouldn't be a good idea if you saw another doctor? Someone fain to understand the workings to the mind. Are you trying to tell me I'm mental? Of course, you're not mental. But you are a little troubled, aren't you? Does it surprise you? James, I want my mother to come for a visit. You talk as if this were a prison and I were your gaoler. [door closes] [thud] Good morning, Harriet. Is James in? No. You've just missed him. He's gone to a cattle sale. Pity, I wanted to have a word with him about the mare. Don't go. Won't you have a drink? I want to talk to you. It'll be a pleasure. I don't think you have any idea how strong the feeling is against your husband. Ever since he turned up here with his second wife. Who is your good self. In fact, ever since you were laid up last week, the villagers have been saying openly that dear James had done you in. Why should they say a thing like that? You don't know villagers. Were you here the afternoon it happened? How do you know that? That never came out of the trial, did it? Why not? [mumbles] If too much mud gets stirred up at a trial, non-necessary mud, other people sometimes get hurt. Cyril. Did you see James kill his wife? What makes you say that? You told everyone he'd killed her. Everyone? I only mentioned to Ann I thought it probable. Anyway, didn't he? But if you weren't absolutely certain, it wasn't a monstrous thing to say! What were you doing here? All right, I'll tell you. I was under my car wiring a loose exhaust pipe when it happened. Then you couldn't have seen a thing. When I finished fixing the exhaust, Maggie came running out. Maggie? Look, I want to know the truth. What did Maggie say when she saw you? As far as I can remember, her actual words were: "Are going to the top of the hill?" "Because I've got to get some eggs, I'm terribly late." She had a cartridge case in her hand. A pair of jeans crumbled up on her lap. She kept muttering to herself under her breath. "Didn't really want her to die," she kept saying. At the top of the hill, she asked me to stop. She got out and buried the jeans under a stone. And I asked why she was doing it. She wouldn't tell me. And I said: "If I was your mother, I'd smack your bottom." And then she said: "You can't talk to Mummy. She's dead." Well, then? I thought she was letting her imagination run away with it. It sounded like the truth, so I cross-questioned her a bit. Then she blurted it out. "Mummy is dead," she said. "Daddy shot her." But if you were so absolutely sure he did it, why didn't you tell the police? It would have meant dragging that poor child to the police court. As for James, he was a nice chap. If he killed his wife... It was good luck to him! She was a spiteful arrogant woman. She never wanted Ann to marry me. You see, I'm just a horse doctor. I'm sorry, Harriet. I'd better get along. Cyril? What am I to do? Look, James was a happy simple sort of person before she got hold of him. He had more than his share of troubles. Don't go putting any more on his shoulder. Even if he's a murderer, he's still the man that you married. The only thing that is different now you've found out is you. Poor Maggie. What she must have gone through... Would it make her happier if her father was executed for murdering her mother? [door slamming] James! What happened? Did you crash in the car? I'm all right. It's nothing serious. He'd been stoned! They stoned him! Why do you make it sound so dramatic and biblical? Some hooligans chucked some bricks at me, that's all. They think James is trying to kill you. "Killer," they shouted. "Murderer!" It was horrible. He just stood there and took it until I came along with one of the farmhands. Then they ran away. Everything was all right until you came! Jean! What an extraordinary thing to say! If Harriet wishes to leave, I shall go with her. I'm not afraid of them. Let them gossip. No. This place is wrong for both of you. Go on, Cyril, why don't you say it? How can a murderer bring his second wife back to the scene of his crime? I didn't mean anything of the sort. Oh, yes, you did. You believe that I killed Eva. And you believe him too, don't you? Just like the rest of them. Well, I suppose I'd better go and wash. Seeing that there's blood on my hands. I think he's badly hurt. Not physically. I sent for Dr. Cole just in case. Thank you. Bad luck. He still doesn't see it, does he? See what? - That you're in love with him. - Rubbish! You've had a crush on him since you were a child. Just because I admire James and understand him, which is more than you do, more than she does, it certainly doesn't follow. Well, well! A Dennison condescending to pour her heart out to a peasant! And I'll tell you something else, Mr. Cyril Sully! - James didn't kill Eva! - Ah! Perhaps I did. Or did you. You know very well who killed her. And so does James. Don't try and look so innocent. I saw you smugger away in the car that day. With a cartridge case and the blood-stained clothes. I was in my secret den. It isn't really secret. Just one of the stable lofts. I'd been shooting pigeons from the skylight. I didn't take any notice when I heard another shotgun. We're always banging off in the yard. Sometimes to try for wood pigeons. But mostly to scare away the crows. Must I go on, Harriet? Uncle Cyril shouldn't have told you. Please, I'd rather know. After a bit, I'd climbed down the ladder and went out into the yard. There was nobody there. Except... - Except... - Your mother. Yes. It was awful. I knelt down beside her. That's how I got blood on my jeans. Daddy told me to throw them away. I looked up and saw him standing there beside me. He was very white. And sort of shivering. I noticed his gun lying beside Mummy. And an empty cartridge case. You've picked it up, didn't you, the cartridge case? Yes. That morning, Mummy'd been very angry with me. And I told her I wished she was dead! Perhaps your mother'd been cleaning the gun and it went off by mistake. It does sometimes happen. No. She was shot in the back of the head. Daddy killed her. I'm sure he didn't mean to, but he killed her. He kept saying: "It's my fault." "I'm guilty." Don't make me talk about it anymore. I'm sorry, Maggie. But talking about it may have helped us both. Now, go and wash your face. And come and help me get the supper. [intriguing music] [mysterious music] [door opens] What's the matter? Darling, what have you done? All your precious perfumes. They're broken. - I didn't do it. - No. No, of course, you didn't. It was just an accident. Don't distress yourself? I'll tidy it up. You go down and help yourself to a drink. But I didn't do it. I didn't do it! How are you, Mrs. Random? A bit under the weather, eh? I won't bother you long. You can go back to sleep. I must speak to Dr. Cole. Now, young lady, wait until I finish taking your temperature. You'll feel better if you shut your eyes. The fraction's abnormal. It usually is when you're mentally upset. A wee bit of hysteria. Please, please, you must listen to me. It's important. I'm not hysterical. My mind is perfectly clear. I know. A little trouble about some broken bottles, wasn't it? Now, don't reproach yourself. Don't worry about why you did it. Just concentrate on getting well, so that you can look after that husband of yours. He's taken a lot of nasty knocks. Your job is to take care of him. And stop worrying about yourself. But I'm going to die. I'm sure I'm going to die. No, you're not. You're just upset. Your husband gave you a sleeping pill. It's making you feel a bit drowsy. Now, go to sleep. I take that she's going to be all right. There's some degree of hysteria. Very common. Nothing to worry about. I gave her some tablets. Got some in my bag. Save you going to the chemist. Thank you for coming anyway. Not at all. I was glad to. And even if that arm of yours is only bruised, I've set your mind at rest about your wife. I didn't break those bottles. It wasn't me. Go to sleep. You'll feel a new woman when you wake up. Yes. Would you put in a couple of bags of molasses meal as well? Good. You'll deliver them tomorrow. Goodbye. Well, how do you feel? Where's Maggie? She's staying with Ann for a day or so. Why? We thought she was getting just a bit too much for you. You've been discussing me with Ann. But, darling! You sent Maggie away because you want me to be alone here! I'm sorry, James. I shouldn't have said that. By the way, your mother is coming just for one night. She's visiting your cousin in Chester. And after that, she can come back here and stay for just as long as you wish. Why have you asked her to come now? Why do you think? Because I thought it would make you happy. Well... I must be off to my committee meeting. I shan't be back until late this evening. I shall be bringing your mother back with me. Now, how about a smile, just for a change? [door closes] - [rumbling] - [ominous music] Hello? Hello? Operator? Mother! Is that you, Mother? She's not coming. Why not? What have you done with her? I waited for the train. When it arrived half an hour late, we had some coffee together and I put her on the train to Chester. It seemed to be pointless for her to break her journey in a weather like this just for one night. But she's coming back on Saturday. You never meant her to come. I tried to telephone you from the station, but the line was out of order. You knew it was. You cut it yourself! Don't be silly. What's the matter? Tell me. Well, I tried to call Ann. But the telephone was cut off. I wanted to ask her up here to dinner, for company. She couldn't have come anyway with Maggie there. If you hadn't sent Maggie away, I wouldn't have been alone. Why did you send her away so suddenly this morning? I had to. She... It wouldn't have been safe. Safe? I suppose she cut the telephone. Although she hasn't been here all day! Next, you'll tell me she shot her own mother. I'm afraid it's necessary for you to know that Maggie did kill her mother. You see, I saw her. From the window. I don't think she really meant to pull the trigger. It was just a kind of childish impulse. She didn't realise the damage she would do. Why bother to tell me all this now? You got me here alone and there's nothing I can do about it. You've stopped my mother coming. I expect you told her I was mentally sick. You've got everyone believing that now, haven't you? Is that what you did to your first wife? Is it? You really have got your mind made up, haven't you? You're convinced! All right. I'm going. And you can lock and bolt all the doors! I thought you are at Ann's. What are you doing here? I had to talk to you. I know how it happened. I'm sure I know. Look! Maggie, you've drawn so many of these things. Look there, in the stable door. Can't you see the shape of the shadows? Someone else was there, Harriet. And I think I know who it was. Well, tell me about it. You don't believe, do you? - Where are you going? - To the stable loft. I have dozens of drawings there. Some of them I did soon after it happened. [ominous music] [door unlocks] Who's there? Maggie? Don't fool about this, dear. Maggie? No! Oh, James! I knew I was right! That afternoon, when I looked out of the window, I thought it was Maggie. When I got to the stable yard, she was kneeling there. And I thought Daddy had done it. But as time went on, I've found it increasingly hard to believe that a child could have done such a thing. You remember, when Maggie came back, I talked to her upstairs. I realised then, of course, that she hadn't done it. The only thing to do was to carry on until we found the murderer. It was unkind to you, but it was the only way. So Jean killed Eva? Then she tried to kill me. Why? Was she in love with you, James? Good heavens, no! She was never in love with me. But she was prepared to marry me to get this place. Random End did belong to the Dennisons for 500 years, and she wanted it back again. Well, we're all together now, Daddy. Of course, we are, darling. [joyful music]
