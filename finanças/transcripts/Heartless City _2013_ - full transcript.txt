Heartless City Episode 15 What should I do, Mom? You know I did well in school. I used to get a lot of awards. When I became the class representative. You gave me hugs and gave me money. We could've lived like that. I'm sorry. Mom, I'm sorry. I was too young back then. I'm sorry. - Mr. Wooden Stick. - Yes. Safari and Doctor's Son. Now I don't want to have anything to do with them. Tell this to everyone. No matter what, find them and eliminate them once and for all. Yes, Chairman. And also... About Ji Hyung Min. If he continues to interfere and present himself to be a roadblock to our work... tell him that our relationship will have to end here. Yes. Doc! Doc! Pick it up, Dammit. What's going on? Since you're calling me and all. - Did you know that Chairman Jo was released? - Already? He sent his guys out to get all of us. So you should not go into your office. Do you understand what I mean? Okay, then I'll be there. Professor Jang... Yes, Jin Sook. - Where are you? - I'm in my room. Then would you do me a favor? There is an envelope inside the desk drawer in the office. You need to bring that to me. If you see suspicious people, turn around right away and leave. You are much more important to me. You understand? Let's not make this long. Just tell me. Where is Lee Jin Sook? Bring that envelope to the place I told you. Okay? - I really don't know. - Do you think I'm joking around? This is a dosage enough for 10 people. Once you get this shot, you'd want to talk. How is it? You want to talk now. Don't you? Now that I see, you are that... Mister! What's this? Who are you? Who the hell are you? This is interesting. I think we need to bring you along. Hey, did you have to take so long? It's so hot out. These leech-like bastards. Die, you bastard. - Mr. Duk Bae. - Yes, Chairman. You are still alive. Okay, I'll see how long you can last. I'll continue to send my guys out. How has everyone been? Hey, Detective Kim. Is everything okay? By the way, Chief Yang, where is Team Leader Ji? What brought you in today? I thought you were in hiding. I should keep my promise. The promise I made to help you catch Doctor's Son. I know that you are the one who killed Jo Ha Neul. I can arrest you right now. Do you have any proof? Our Team Leader Ji doesn't seem like the type to bluff. Since you are not dragging me into the interrogation room... I don't think you intend to put me under arrest. But plan on using me instead. - Isn't that right? - You are right. I plan on using you to catch Pusan and Doctor's Son. Isn't that the common courtesy toward the senior officer? That is if you don't die before that. Of course, even if you die, I'll definitely get them. But I'm afraid you might feel little shortchanged. Since you chose this path, going as far as betraying the police... Our Team Leader Ji Hyung Min has grossly misunderstood something. The police? Betrayal? After you've seen and experienced this world how can you still think so naively about things? You listen to me carefully, Team Leader Ji. Once you follow us into our world, that's the end of it. But the thing is, unless you crossed the line, you can never get an accurate picture. From what I've seen so far... I bet you've crossed the line long ago. Once you cross the line, the police, the druggies, they are all the same. Do you understand what I mean? If I may add one more thing... you could die before me. That's what I'm saying. So, no matter what... whatever it takes... You have to survive. Do you understand? The reason why I came by today is because... I wanted to give an important piece of information. Why do you think things always don't go the way you planned? Ah, I'm sorry. Scale, that bastard, made a sudden U-turn. Don't move! Are you crazy, bastard? I'm sorry. Try to work it out step by step. Starting from the top dog. What's up with this weather? You know that we can't have air conditioning. My god, it's hot. - Why do you look that like that? - What? - Were you crying? - No, I wasn't. Why? Was Ji Hyung Min being a jerk? - No, that's not it. - So he was. Who else could make you cry other than Ji Hyung Min? Do you know why Hyung Min liked Detective Lee Gyung Mi? He liked her because she gave him power. The power to fight them. He's rejecting you because... probably because you could take that power away from him. Because of my dad? Having your kind of background comes with a certain price. That's why Hyung Min is rejecting even his own father, Commissioner Ji. [Congressman Cha] [My Daughter] [Your call was disconnected.] You came here first. - Let's sit down. - Yes. Thank you for making time in your busy schedule. You seem like you've lost weight. It's good to lead an active life as a congressman, but you should take care of your health. My health isn't that important. The people and the country come first. Ah, were you able to smooth things over with Chairman Jo? Yes, I definitely gave him the message. That's great. You know that we have far more to go until the election. Since it's a fight that requires a lot of goods the congressman has been worried about it a lot. Shouldn't you be the one who takes away that worry for him? Come in. That thing from before. Take that to the next door. Yes. Yes, come in. This is from Chairman Jo. - What is this? - It's an 100 year old wild ginseng. Since it's a gift, we should receive it gladly. Oh, it's an 100 year old wild ginseng. Okay, why don't we each take one. I understand that our children have been hanging out together recently. Were you aware of that? So you knew about it. Yes, I guess. At this rate, we could be in-laws. Since that could be the case... It might be a good idea for you to make your son stop now. As you know, Chairman Jo is cut from a different fabric. What's going to happen to me now? I'm so scared. Nothing's going to happen. Don't worry. Pil Joon, this isn't good. Let's go back. Why can't you can't quit doing this work? That's... That's okay. Yes, Jin Sook. Where are you? What happened? Are you okay? Yes, they almost got me but... luckily, I escaped. But I hurt my leg a little. I'm sorry. I should've called you. I did pick up your envelope. Yes, I'll definitely get it to you. Yes. By the way, why were you there? Please stop doing this work. I beg you. I told you that you wouldn't be able to handle this world. I used to have a sister. She taught me how to live in this world. You know what, Mister? The world is like a mirror. If I spit and curse at the world, the world would do the same. And if I smile, the world would also smile. That's what my sister told me. So my sister was always smiling. Always. But, my sister died. The world is like a mirror? I don't believe that kind of bullshit anymore. The world that killed my sister who always smiled. And yet, she's done nothing wrong. I'm going to take revenge... on this damn world. That's why... I can't leave this world. I have something I want to ask you. Please tell me honestly. If I stay in your world, it'll be difficult for you. Right? I think so. Okay. I've got it. Then I'd like to ask you a favor. Please don't get hurt. Mister... Mr. Gangster. Jung Shi Hyun. Shi Hyun. Shi Hyun. There, I called you by everything now. Goodbye. Soo Min! What happened? Did something happen? No, my leg was hurting so badly... Here is the envelope. I'm so relieved. I was so worried about you. I thought something bad had happened to you. It's okay. It's okay. You've returned safely so that's good. It's okay. What happened? Over there, that was Gyung Mi's desk. Team Leader Ji. Wh... What is it? He is a prosecutor and is using my office for the time being. Prosecutor, she's like my sister to me. Say hello. - Hello. - Hi. - Should we go now? - Yes. Wait for me for a moment here. Get back to your work. - Joo Young. - Yes. Who introduced you to Prosecutor Ahn? You know what I do. Right? If you lie, I'll be able to tell right away. Who sent you to Prosecutor Ahn? I really don't know what you are talking about. Joo Young. You listen carefully now. The one who sent you to Prosecutor Ahn might be the one who killed Gyung Mi. Who is it? Honestly, other than he's called President Jung... I don't know anything about him. - President Jung? - Yes. Team Leader Ji. Let me see you for a second. Get the door. Do you have anything you want to say? - Okay. - Wait. Fine. What do you want? What is it that you want? Stop seeing Han Joo Young. And you'll help me catch Doctor's Son. I'm helping you now. What more do you want me to... Do you want me to have you kicked out? Team Leader Ji. By any chance, do you know Doctor's Son? I'm going to take revenge. It's just that I don't know the ways of the world that well. You know I'm really naive. Answer your phone. Yes. Hello. This is Doctor's Son. Answer your phone. Yes. Hello. This is Doctor's Son. The undercover you planted under Lee Jin Sook. You better abort that mission. Ji Hyung Min. Are you out of your mind? She'll die. Yoon Soo Min. Don't make the same mistake twice. I beg you. This is urgent. Trace this number at once. She's my informant and I think she's been exposed. Hurry. Where are you now? You should come back right now. What are you talking about? You've been discovered. Doctor's Son found out about you. Okay, I'm going to hang up. I'll call you soon. Who was it? Excuse me? Who were you talking to? Yes... it was a friend. I have to go now. Take good care of your ankle. - I'll call you. - Yes. Soo Min. Mister. Soo Min! Are you okay? What's going on? Soo Min! You must have nine lives. Do you want to know what the secret is? Oh, the field maiden was here, too. Big sister. I'd like to give you advice. You should be more polite when you talk to me. Big sister? Were you a woman? I don't feel like talking to you. Go back to the field. Wait outside. While you are there, why don't you pick some peppers for me. What happened? Did you ask for forgiveness from Doc? Yeah, I was on my hands and knees. Happy now? You did the right thing. You know why I came all the way here to meet you. It's Pusan we are dealing with. You should help Doc no matter what. That's the only way you can live through this anyway. Whether he's going to ally with me or not is up to him. So you need to help me out here. Then we can all live. I got it so you better not screw this up. And one more thing... Don't even think about looking at his back. I don't need to explain what that means, do I? - By any chance... - What? I killed Miss Jung Mi Hee by supplying drugs to her. Is that what you told Doc? What are you talking about? What about Mi Hee? Tell me more details. If you mouth off one more time... Why don't you hold your knife correctly. If you use it like that, you'll cut your hand. I'm a pro. I'm holding it right. Pro? Don't you see Doc is right behind you? I heard you tried to cut my sister. Can't you see that I'm being as patient as Jesus? What? What should I do to you? You really want me to slash a line on your face, huh? Answer me! Jin Sook. If you ever try this kind of shit again... You'd better get ready to be admitted to a hospital. Got that? Man, you woman. There was a reason why I asked you to hold back. Do you understand? Yes. Jin Sook. - Why are you... - Why? I can't come here? What is this about? Let's be honest. You must know what I do without me explaining to you. Pusan, is it that you won't catch him or you can't catch him? We are trying to catch him. Give me information on Pusan. I'm asking you this as a favor. You could at least do that for me. Jin Sook. You should stop now. And you should leave that world. - How could you say this to me now? - Jin Sook. Don't tell me you had nothing to do with how I ended up here. I guess it was my fault for having expectations. If I give you Pusan's information, what can you do for me? What do you want from me? Do you realize it now? You are that kind of bastard. Were you the one who told Shi Hyun that nonsense? Did you tell Shi Hyun that Mi Hee died because of Safari? I never told him that. Don't try to bullshit. Do you think I don't know when you try to bullshit? Why did you do that, huh? Were you going to use Shi Hyun, as you've done with me? Use him? I use Shi Hyun? The last time when I saw Shi Hyun, he was 15 years old. How could I use a 15 year old boy and for what? I know you. You use whatever you can. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Yang Suk Choon and Moon Duk Bae were on the same team. But why are you asking around about the past? - Can you wrap 10 chickens for me? - 10 chickens? I have many mouths to feed. Oh, okay, okay. Just wait a minute. Honey. Bastards. They didn't even offer me any. Wow, how long has it been? When Detective Lee Gyung Mi was around, Team Leader used to treat us a lot. - After what happened to Detective Lee... - Stop talking about that now. Yes, Team Leader. Where are you? Yes? Yes, okay. Team Leader. Why don't you join us? - Please have a seat. - Yes. Do you know where I got those chickens? Excuse me? I got them from the restaurant run by Detective Park who quit three years ago. - Why did you do that? - Excuse me? Moon Duk Bae, why did you pretend not to know him? I heard from Detective Park. When Moon Duk Bae was in the narcotics division in the headquarters... You were also on his team. - I'm sorry. - I'm sure you had your reasons for playing ignorant. Who was it? The one who deleted your record from the narcotics division and sent Moon Duk Bae on an undercover mission. Who was it? - Chief Yang. - Yes. Moon Duk Bae was an undercover agent I sent to the Pusan Organization. In that world, he goes by the nickname, Safari. Why are you telling me this now? Moon Duk Bae is a failed undercover agent. He betrayed me and the police. I did want to reveal that fact. He can still be a cop because he is able to lure Pusan out in the light. After it was discovered that Safari Moon Duk Bae was a cop... Pusan started to make his moves. In the meantime, Jo Ha Neul was killed. Finally, Chairman Jo showed himself. We have a once in a life time kind of chance now. How many more of your undercover agents are out there now? So the all the information you got from so called an informant... Was it all from an undercover agent? I understand. I'm not going to object to your methods and to the number of people you've sent as an undercover. But I'd like to ask one thing. If there's another agent who betrays the police again... I expect you to tell me about it immediately. I'm sorry, Team Leader. Chief Yang. I don't want you to hide anything from now on. Yes. - Chief Yang. - Yes. Just for a minute... Do you know which organization Moon Duk Bae first entered as an undercover? I don't know a many details. Director Min had always handled the details of the mission. But I know approximately the areas he was covering. Where was it? He was in charge of the Cheongryang-ri area. Cheongryang-ri. Lee Jin Sook. By any chance, did you know Lee Jin Sook from before? Excuse me? No. - Are you sure? - Of course. Actually... Director Min once came into the interrogation room. What brought you to the interrogation room? - Are you going to be questioning her? - Yes. - Make sure you do it thoroughly. - Yes. Director Min came into the interrogation room? Yes, it was when Lee Jin Sook was in the room. We need to meet. There is a problem. It's dangerous. You and me both! Ji Hyung Min is suspicious of me. What? I think he figured out that I have an undercover agent. Of course, if you want, I can reveal everything. But if that happens, not only Kim Hyun Soo but Lee Jin Sook's information... would need to be handed over. Would you be able to do that? So far, I've tried to keep things hidden doing whatever I can. But now, we really don't have much time. We have enough time. Because there will be no more deals with Pusan. I'm going to do everything, including production and distribution. - That's how I'm going lure Pusan out. - Shi Hyun, that's... Don't worry. As soon as I get Pusan, I'll tell you the location of their drug production facility. So you should tell me everything about Pusan. What? The Prosecutor's Office behind Pusan. It's possible that a high powered politician might be connected to this. I just want to catch them all. All those rotten bastards. Is it Doc? Have you eaten? You should have some. How long has it been? It's been a while since we had a meal together like this. There is no end to how scary Pusan is. The prosecutors, the police... I couldn't even figure out how it goes up. Was that your mission when you were a cop? Don't ask me about my past. It's embarrassing. In short, Pusan isn't someone you can catch righteously and fairly. On the contrary... Pusan can kill us righteously and fairly. That's it. We can both die from this fight. Do you understand what I'm talking about? - Fine, let me ask you this. - Okay. Detective Lee Gyung Mi. Was it really Pusan's doing? I already told you that it was him. I'm sorry, Chairman. I should have taken care of Director Jo's belongings. You probably had no desire to do that. No, that's not it, Chairman. How could I possibly... Doctor's Son. Where would I be able to find him? I really don't know about that, Chairman. If you don't even know where he lives then why did you take his side? I only told the truth, Chairman. Safari definitely killed director Jo. I'm going to ask you again. Why did you take Doctor's Son's side? - Chairman, actually... - Mr. Scale. Right now the truth isn't important. Don't you know? The important thing is why you took Doctor's side. Do you understand? - Chairman. - Mr. Wooden Stick. The number four iron. Is this Doc? This is Scale calling. Yes. You'll need to come here. What is this about? I have something I want to talk to you about. About what? I found out where Chairman Jo's drug production facility is. Why don't you come and talk to me. Is Chairman Jo there? No, no, no. He's not here. I'm sorry, Scale. Sure, you are not the one who could be fooled so easily. I'd like to ask you one thing. My son... Please take care of him. I understand. - Mr. Doc. - Yes, Chairman. Scale is dead because of you, Mr. Doc. Do you understand? Listen to Scale's throat split open. Did you hear it? I'll see you again very soon. My dad is the best! Where have you been really? We need to get Pusan off that street. We are at war with Pusan. Goddammit, now something like this is... What the hell is this? The number is blocked. Who is this? - It's been a while. - President Jung? I'll just get to the point. Who's above you? - Why, President Jung? - Think carefully and answer. Why don't we meet and talk? Isn't it awkward to talk about things like this over the phone? Go ahead and eat. [Prosecutor Ahn] Excuse me. You are going to meet with President Jung? Let's talk when I get back. Until I get back, don't go anywhere. - Okay? - Yeah. - You promised. - Okay. And also... You should finish that. There is the front and the back entrance. Chief Yang will be on standby in the kitchen. Detective Shin will take the entrance. Detective Kim will be on standby in the middle. He's very quick so try not to get noticed. Go and finish preparing. We'll leave here in 15 minutes. Make sure to double check all the equipment. Yes. - Hey, Detective Shin. - Yes. - The key for the handcuffs? - I'll look for it. The unit one at the front entrance. Check all the incoming vehicles. If a situation occurs, you'll seal off the gate. The unit two in the kitchen. We'll be on standby in the hall. - Is the unit three in the lobby? It's the front counter. - Unit four. - I secured a spot in the mid hall way. This is Doctor's Son. Until there is further instruction, be on standby at your current position. He's approximately in his early 30's. He's about 180 centimeters tall. He has a lean body type. I'm going to be right next door, so try to act natural. How is it working here? It's time to eat something. Hey, stop! Front entrance. Was there any car? How is the hallway, Detective Kim? So far, I just see regular patrons. We don't know where he's going to come from. Yes. Pay close attention and watch carefully. Yes, I understand. Yes. It's President Jung. Ah, yes, President Jung. Huh? I'm in room 27. I told them about it at the front register. He's looking for the room. Detective Shin, is everything okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm in room 27. I'll be waiting. He came inside. Everyone should hold their position. No, no, no, no! Don't move. Doctor's Son? Are you Doctor's Son? Answer me! He's someone I really need. Do you need to find him? Jin Sook gave me a task. That means she trusts me. President Jung, are you Doctor's Son? I'll take Chairman Jo's position. What are you going to do about Doctor's Son? He's going to be pitiful at the end. Would you use me? Is this Doc? Don't you realize that I've been protecting Kim Hyun Soo and Lee Jin Sook? You mean you've been using them. - Ji Hyung Min! - Why did you help me? I told you. I want us to get Pusan together.
