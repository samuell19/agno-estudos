Yeah, bro. Morning. What? Kallis! - Hi, hello, greetings and welcome! - Kallis! Look at the damn time! I'm ready. Here. We're so late, dude. We only have 10 minutes. How are we going to get there? No worries. Why is there so much traffic early in the morning? Dude, make it fly. We don't have time! Have you packed? Dude, I packed my clothes last night. Oh no! Here comes the phone call. There is no way I'm answering the call! I've run out of lies! Used up all the excuses. What am I going to say now? Say that we'll be there in five minutes. Don't care who comes on the other side. Take them down! Cut in, dude! We only have one minute left! Hurry up. "Let's laugh, let's fly, we've grown wings" "Let's stomp, let's jump no point worrying." "Let's laugh, let's fly, we've grown wings" "Let's stomp, let's jump no point worrying." "To chill, time and day are no bar" "Shout 'cheers' and you'll see heaven is not far." "Saturday nights are not enough to party" "Everyday's Sunburn Fest, nothing else on priority." "Let's laugh! Let's fly!" 'Let's laugh, let's fly, we've grown wings" "Let's stomp, let's jump no point worrying." 'Let's laugh, let's fly, we've grown wings" "Let's stomp, let's jump no point worrying." It needs to load fast on both Android and iOS. - Okay. - What is your lead time? We can do it in a month. - Thank you. - I'll text it to you. "Ain't no tomorrow, today's all you got" "No reason needed, cherish what you got." "Legs always moving', like the hands on a clock" "Who cares what they say? Do what feels right." 'Let's break grammar, let's birth art; Let's defy rules, kick open bolted doors!' "This fire in our heads can't be put out" "This drive in our hearts won't let us rest." "This endless dance unites all the youth" "This euphoria gets us high on music." "Let's be re-born, devouring this feast" "Let's quake the ground, dancing to the beats." "Yo break the door, let's hit the floor; Don't be a bore, Go crazy, roar!" "The one life we got, give it a shot; No matter what, let's party hard!" "Let's laugh, let's fly, we've grown wings" "Let's stomp, let's jump no point worrying." "Let's laugh, let's fly, we've grown wings" "Let's stomp, let's jump no point worrying."

"Let's laugh, let's fly, we've grown wings" "Let's stomp, let's jump no point worrying." Dude... You've been looking for 2 months now. You could at least ask her name. Watch me today. I've been watching you every single day. Excuse me? 99 rupees, madam. Okay. Brother, give me a 10 rupee recharge coupon. - Would one do? - Yes. Madam... What's this? Oh... sorry, brother. I didn't have change for 10 rupees. But I can't accept a toffee instead of cash! When you gave me a toffee because you didn't have change, I took it didn't I? Madam, that was a 1 rupee toffee. But you're giving me a 10 rupee one! But 1 rupee is money too, right? It's not the same as 10 rupees, madam. It is the same! When it's hard earned money, 1 rupee is the same as 10 rupees! You're actually doing business by giving me this toffee. You're selling it to me without my permission. I guess you'd make a profit of around 20 paisa in this? If you do the same with a 100 customers in a day, you'd make 20 rupees. Then in an entire month, you'd make around... Sorry! From now, I'll expect this change back from you. That's it! Beat him, beat him, beat him... She is a great girl. Look closer, That's the Undertaker. I meant that girl who rides the scooter. You talk about her all the time! That was about her looks. Now I meant her character. Undertaker can't get beaten! Booze, chips, sauce, and side-dish! Winner winner... chicken dinner! Dude, we swipe our cards without checking the bill amount... but she argued so much for 1 rupee! The shopkeeper just froze! You've gone mad. She's my kind of girl. - I doubt she'd be single. - Why do you say that? It scares you, right? Then trust me... Next time you see her, confess your love! We're the kind of guys who meet Bhavana for breakfast and Lavanya for lunch! Why are you over-thinking this? Dude... I've decided. What? To not let me sleep? You were right, dude. We've partied a lot. Seen plenty of girls. But she is different. She does something to me. That's it! I've decided. I'm going to tell her tomorrow. I will propose her at once I see That's right, dude. I don't want to drag it out. She's not here yet. I'm sure she will come today. Doesn't let me sleep at night, doesn't let me sleep when I drive. Wait and see how I tell her. I'm sure. Brainless moron! - Keep your eyes on the road. - It's not my fault. - He didn't let me sleep! - That was an earful! Really? This rental cycle shook up our car so much? Our baby is strong! - Thank god, it's nothing. - Shut up! This is your chance. Seal the deal! Don't over-think it. Just play it smooth. Don't worry, I know this mechanic. He will fix it perfectly! Why are you laughing at the vehicle? It's said laughter is the best fuel. I'm laughing to make it run. So funny! I'll laugh all weekend thinking about it. - Is it? - What's the status, brother? It's a minor problem! I'll fix it in 10 minutes. I'll give you 200 bucks, tell her it will take 2 hours. Does he think I'm an useless piece? It's a love matter, brother. Love? Or matter? The deep sincere feeling from inside. That sort of love! It will take 2 hours. You can come back later. I'll have it fixed. Okay, brother. You get it fixed. I need to be some place important. I'll be back. Tell me where you need to be. I'll drop you. No. Let it be. I'm fine. How could I let it be? I meant, we caused the accident. We are responsible. Tell me where, I'll drop you! He will stay with your vehicle. Right, dude? No, that's okay. You said it's urgent, you can't take the bus. It has to be an auto or a cab! It will cost you at least 100 bucks. Why should you waste your money for the accident we caused? When it's hard earned money, 1 rupee is as important as 100 rupees! Just think of it as a cab ride and come with me! Thinks he's The Hitch, getting couples together. Thanks, bro! That reminds me... Two bros always next to each other, but never get together. - Who are they? - Eyebrows! Yeah, ma'am. I've started. I have it with me. Sure, ma'am. No, I'll be there. Okay, ma'am. See you. Is it urgent? Should I drive faster? No! There is no problem. You're a nurse, right? - A physiotherapist? - Why do you ask? My house is right next to the place of the accident. I've seen you go to the opposite house several times. You come once a week. Correct? You come there, park your vehicle... and go in with this box. You don't come out for at least 2 to 3 hours. As far as I know, only an old lady lives there. So I guessed you must be coming there to give her some treatment. Besides, you are getting calls non-stop. So it was confirmed. Looks like you've been noting me quite a bit? Not you! An old lady lives alone across my house. We're also responsible for her safety, right? So I just made note of the people who visit. You haven't told me what you do! I'm a beautician. Oh! A beautician! Where do you work? I freelance. Door to door service. That's the best! Hey, by the way... I'm a freelancer too. App developer. Let me know if you need an app for your beauty services! Tell me your number. Well, I'll call you if I require any beauty services. Sorry, this is a 'ladies only' service. Don't worry! I know a lot of ladies. I'll refer you. Which house across mine do you go to? The one you said... the old lady's house. The old lady? Why not? Weekly once, she gets a manicure, pedicure, facial, waxing and threading. Kallis used to say that old lady is something... maybe this is the reason? Right there. Stop here. - Thanks a lot. - No worries. Punctuality is very important in my job. I need to be on time! So, thank you very much for getting me here on time. Save some of those 'thanks'. By the time you finish your job, your scooter will be here. No, don't bother yourself. You have to drive all the way. It won't be me going all the way. I don't deserve this. Do I really have to stop at a signal in this cycle? I'll use this phone call to build it up. Hello! Basically, I'm a biker... I'm riding this silly thing just today! I usually ride only powerful imported bikes. I can easily perform stunts like stoppies, wheelies... I'm riding this thing only to help my friend with something! Somehow, I'm enjoying waiting on the signal today. Just when I say that, there's a green light. Dude, I'm on my way. I'll be there in a bit. If not for your help, I'd have had a tough time. Thank you so much. I'm Siddharth. Oh, sorry... I'm Meera. I'm in love with you, Meera. Love? You just knew my name. But I've known you for a while now. I saw you the first time near my house. I liked you right away. I still don't know how or why. In fact, I've waited there several times just so I can see you. It's a little filmy, right? I know. It's not like me. But I really like this feeling. When we were driving together in the car... it was a superb feeling. I wished that drive would last longer. That's why I just said it. It must sound shocking now. But think about it. That's my number. Note it down. You can call me anytime. I'll wait. I'll see you, Meera. There is good reception. Dude, hope you haven't missed any phone calls. Why hasn't that girl called yet? - Don't you feel the tension? - Why tension? Dude, you just proposed to her! Will she reply back? Will she accept it? So many reasons for tension! But you are so cool about it! It's not that complicated. I saw her, I liked her, I told her. That's all! If she feels the same, let her say it. Obsessing over it and wasting time is... Dude, you're getting a call. It's her! - Beauty the-rapist... - Give it to me! Dude... Hello? Hi, Meera. No, tell me. Yeah... Okay... Definitely! For sure. What's he doing? Oh, he is dancing! He just spoke to her over phone. But he looks like he just made out with her! Fine, I'll ask. Tell me what happened? It was Meera on the phone. She wants to meet me tomorrow. At the park. That hotel isn't lucky for you. Choose some hotel that is empty! Dude, I didn't mean the hotel. I meant an actual park! - The corporation park. - The corporation park? Yuck! We are party animals. What are we doing here? Look around, there are only school kids here! Dude, I look okay? All superb! My eyes? Are they red? White as Tamannah's skin! Superb, dude! Let's just warn him. Dude, you didn't put in a lot of time into this... You saw her, like her, you told her. In case the girl rejects you, you shouldn't feel bad. Okay? If not her, there are plenty of other fish. Also, I saw that girl up close... Her eyes were all round... like wheat flour. Wheat flour? She isn't in your league! Who is that with her? My friend, Shreya. Hi, I'm Sid. Hi! Nice to meet you. Kallis. I'm Kallis! She didn't like my name? Kallis, you know all about girls. Just do something and impress her! Dude! Why don't you two go in and talk in privacy? We'll be waiting here. Take your time, dude. Go, go, go! Shall we? Phew! Time for my solo performance. Sid! One moment. - One second... - Come! Doesn't matter how long you've known a girl or tailed her. If you see a girl and she is the one, you will just know it! See, your face looks so bright. I just saw her up close. She looks so good! Just make her yours. Okay? Make her say yes. Your happiness is important to me. I saw you checking her out. - All the best, buddy. - Okay, dude. "We guys are all terrific; I'm gonna woo this chick!" You always ride a powerful motorcycle? Remember, we saw each other at the signal? You ride that motorcycle... so different! What's different about it? It's a showroom model. I thought you were all glamour, but that was some humour! Give me your number. - What for? - So I can save it and delete it! To talk, of course! Give me your number. Sorry, I don't talk to guys. Oh wow! I don't talk to guys either. Same pinch. Now give me your number. - Meera is your best friend, right? - Yeah. I'm sure their love is working out. Then it would be hookah parlours, ice cream parlours, beauty parlours, coffee shops, restaurants, OMR Food Street, and ECR Drive. They will go by car, and you'll ride your bike alone? But I'd ride pillion with you. Hello! Take a break. Meera has only gone to respond to your friend. Don't assume it's going to be a positive response. When Sid asks a girl out, there is no way she will reject him. Don't say this in Kerala! - They fall for him at first sight. - This is too much. Okay, let's place a bet. If they come back as lovers, give your number to me. Or, give me your number! Okay! Thank god! I'll get committed, make her photo my wallpaper, and upload couple tik-tok videos. What did you say? Dude... Yes, dude? All okay? Yes! Come on! Dude... Let this be the last time I'm hugging a man! "O Pretty Eyed Girl! You've got me hooked" "And I'm beyond help." "My heart will never obey me again; Now that your eyes have stolen mine." "My sunshine, my dew-drop; My beautiful flower." "My full-moon, my word; Don't ever leave me." "Don't ever go anywhere without me; Don't ever go far away from me." "Don't ever go to anyone but me; Don't ever leave me." "Don't ever go anywhere without me; Don't ever go far away from me." "Don't ever go to anyone but me; Don't ever leave me." This is the place. I grew up like these kids. We may think what we give is insignificant... but to them, it's a big deal. In life, people generally get what they want. But here... they get what others don't want. If I'm leading a life on my own today... it's because of this Home and the Mother here. Without this place... I wouldn't be here. "My dearest darling...downpour" You like it? Pick it up. Don't look at the price tag. I've never picked up things looking at the price tag. I look at the size! They'd come and dump all the clothes we get through donation. We'd pick them up depending on our sizes. "You came here to merge into me" "Don't ever go anywhere without me; Don't ever go far away from me." "Don't ever go to anyone but me; Don't ever leave me." "So many fish in the sea; Only one is destined for me." "That fish has hooked itself to my pole; Don't think twice, just grab it." "I have a hundred thoughts everyday; Those hundred thoughts are all about you." "My flower adorned with flowers, you will see" "I won't ever let you wither, come rain or shine." "I'll make a cradle for you in my heart" "And rock you so you may never be disturbed." "My dear! My sweet rain! Our bond knows no bounds." "My dearest! Help me find myself." "I'll make a cradle for you in my heart; Shall I rock you lovingly?" Home cooked food after a really long time. Feels good. It's the first time for me. Only now am I experiencing my own home, a family... Family isn't necessarily a good thing. Even I had everything... mom, dad, a house. One fine day, they said they're getting divorced. Both of them remarried. They became separate families. Now, I don't know which family I belong to! Instead of this, I'd rather not have a family. "Don't ever go anywhere without me; Don't ever go far away from me." "Don't ever go to anyone but me; Don't ever leave me." "Don't ever go anywhere without me; Don't ever go far away from me." "Don't ever go to anyone but me; Don't ever leave me." Card declined. Try this one. This is declined, too. Try this! - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. My darling! Love isn't as bad as Simbu claims in his songs! It's quite good, actually. The days just flew! So did the balance in my card. - What? - The card got declined. How long since we did a project? Not sure, dude. Must be a month. Let's take a break from all this... and do some sincere shopping? What's your Wi-Fi password? Tell me your Wi-Fi password. Sir, I'm calling from EZ Cart. You've got a delivery. The house is locked. I'll be there in 5 minutes. - I'll wait here? - Yeah, I'll be there. Okay, sir. Please come. - What's the amount? - 92 thousand, sir. Ninety two. - Hello? - Buy Today delivery, sir. I just stepped out. Where are you now? In front of your house. It's locked. Come to the main road and turn right. I'm at the tea shop. Here. Hope there are no damages. - How much? - 88 thousand. 88 thousand... Kumararajan... [random voices of delivery men] Let's return all the laptops with interchanged parts and ask for replacement. I tried all night. It doesn't download anything. Must be some network problem. Did you check? I'm getting a connection only next week! Good lad! Let's sell the new laptops online and make some dough, okay? Cool, dude! I'm selling them as we speak. I want, want, want an ice-cream. I want it right away! No ice-cream. Dad, please dad! Yes, he is travelling with his family. No one else. We have the tools, too. This is the right time. I'm telling you repeatedly... no ice-cream at night. Dad, I promise I will never ask for an ice-cream again. Please, dad! Don't disturb him when he is driving. Okay? No ice-cream. Sit! Boss, he is pulling over? Pull over. - What flavour do you want? - Vanilla! - Okay! - Dear, listen to me... Two vanilla ice-creams in my car, please? He is coming here! What is it, man? You've been following me for a while. Is it a 'hit'? Yeah? You're outsiders? How many of you are here? Oh, you've got tools too! I'll whack you! My house is right here. Want to come? My wife, daughter, and I... we will get down all alone. There is no sentry. Want to come? Or I can drop them and be back. You'll wait here? Good! Wait right here for 5 minutes. The cops from K4 Police Station will come for you. Okay? Is it Esaki Muthu? A car near the roundabout... - Got your ice-cream, ladies? - What happened? Nothing to worry. Jokers! - Let's go? - Let's go! You want to go for a drive or go home? Home! - Sleepy? - No! Let's go! They are from Tuticorin. Ratnam had hired them... he's organised the hit. But after the missed attempt, he's gone absconding. Both his houses are under our surveillance. His mobile is switched off, but we are tracking it. We'll get him in 24 hours, sir. Okay. Thank you, sir. Who has gone to my house for protection? Guru was on it. Let me check with him. Let's just go home for lunch. Okay? Okay, sir. 'I need your help right now' 'Can you check the map going for mountain?' - Have you eaten? - Yes, sir. Laptop and cartoons? Stand back! Sir, what happened? - Amjad, get a wet cloth. - Iniya! What happened? Iniya? Take her, just go out. Careful! Don't worry. Don't scare We've arrested Ratnam's men, sir. They are not connected to this. Our suspects only slash and stab. They never go this far! Fair enough! What do they know about laptops? Yes, sir Sir, the laptop had been under continuous use. The SMPS and motherboard are old. So it got heated up 10 times more than normal. The battery inflated and exploded. Old? - I bought it ten days back. - What? But it's all old. No, it's brand new! I unwrapped it from the box. Is it? Where did you buy it? Sir, we're extremely sorry for what happened. Let me clear one thing from our side. We are just a platform to buy and sell products. It doesn't mean anything you buy on EZ Cart is sold by us. We have millions of products, and thousands of dealers selling them. We authorise dealers only after checking their history. You got your laptop from... AL Traders. They have a neat profile. Their contact details are in the invoice. Please check it. Sir? It came from Dubai only last month. A customer ordered it 20 days back. But they returned it because they didn't like the colour. Does this have the customer details? It's here. Oh, yeah. Check this out. Okay, sir. You don't check a returned product? You just pack it again and sell it to someone else? Sir, we look at the reason for return and examine it accordingly. The reason in this case was the colour. So we only look for damage, scratches and working condition. If it's good, we repack it. We've never had a problem till now. - Got anything? - The number is switched off. We're trying to find the details. Where is this customer's address? It's the next house. It's been locked up for 6 months. They've all gone abroad. Sir, I remember clearly, it was this house. Did you go in to deliver it? No, sir. He was outside when I called him. He asked me to wait for 5 minutes... I waited right here. He came and collected it from me. How did he come? I think it was a call taxi. What did he look like? He was a handsome man. He was fair and tall. - Amjad... - Sir? Check if there are CCTVs in any houses there. See if you can find something in the date he mentioned. This is spicy! Spicy? I don't think so. What happened? A headache? You know that man? I thought I did.... thankfully, I don't. So what if you know him? We aren't supposed to ask such questions. She doesn't entertain them. She hangs out with us. But doesn't share any personal information. - Why are you-- - I'm not asking anything! Sid is asking. Not me! Let it go... She'll tell us when she wants to. Check. My dad is an alcoholic. He'd always be drinking in some club. By club, I don't mean the one with dance and parties. Gambling. One day, he lost everything he had. He was so drunk. The other guy goaded him, so he gambled me, and lost. That man must be 50 years old. He planned it and trapped me. He harassed my father to get me married to him. You wonder if such things actually happen in real life! We couldn't do anything. My parents gave me whatever money they had... and told me to just make the run. It's been 8 months. So far, I've managed to stay hidden. But she isn't worried anymore. You say it! You paid the bill? It's my treat today. What's the treat for? All your family problems are solved? The problem isn't solved, but I don't have to fear anymore. What does that mean? I got a job. In Maldives. At the W Hotel. Hey, congrats. Thanks, Sid. It came out of nowhere! I wanted to surprise you. Great news. When are you joining? - In two weeks. - Two weeks... So soon? I'm waiting for the visa. Call my number, dude. Okay. Damn. What is it? - Kallis? - Don't talk to me. Go away, woman. Did I fall for you at the signal? Did I ask for your number? Did I come after you? - Yes, you did! - Don't talk... Just go away. Dude, don't feel bad. - This is not our style. - Come on, Deva! Shreya, you don't need to go anywhere. You can work right here. I couldn't find work here... So what? We'll start our own restaurant. I've had this plan in mind for a while now. Now I've decided. Let's do it quickly. A simple restaurant. And a beauty spa. - You think we can do it? - Why not? We believe in your talent. We will arrange for the funds. All of us, together, forever. None of this going away, missing each other, useless sentiments. Thanks to you, even this life feels like a dream. But you're talking something better. Will it really happen? Promise. Dude... What say? Okay? What is she finally saying? Does she love me or what? Sorry. Okay, fine! Which song? "Its jolly time to celebrate, my lovely lass" According to the forensic reports, there are no traces of explosives in the laptop. I don't think it can be personal vengeance. This accident is 100% due to replacement of parts. This wasn't done for fun. It is product tampering. It's a well planned crime. If the laptop had blast 30 seconds earlier... Thankfully, nothing happened at our home. But if we let this slide... it will happen at some other home. He gave a random address... How does he know no one lives there? He got that mobile number with a fake ID. How did he get that? He's planned and executed it in an organized manner. I don't think he did this for one laptop. It's a scam. Someone buys something online, changes the parts... easily return it and get away safely? None of the websites could trace him? Do you know the worth of India's online retail market? 2000 billion! About 100 million people shop online. The guy we're looking for is one of those 100 million! He doesn't do it daily. Only occasionally. Order, delivery, return. It's just a 1 week job. Perfectly safe. Infact, most online portals aren't even aware of such a scam. Then how do we catch him? Tell the Cyber Cell to send a circular to all major online shopping portals. Okay, sir. Get me the ID and details of customers who ordered expensive electronic items... with cash on delivery and immediately returned them. If we do that, we have a chance. We can't catch him with the information we have. But we can catch him with the mistake he will commit. Happy? That was something! I love you, dude. My idea was okay? A great idea! It will be great if it works. If it works? It will. We need a lot of money. We don't have any savings. We've squandered the money we had. So what? Let's make some now. Till now, we've not even worried about getting caught. But now, with this love, our future and marriage to consider... I'm scared that we will get caught. How can we not get caught? We will definitely get caught. There's this saying... 'A habitual thief eventually gets caught.' It's true. But only the one who does the same kind of theft. Not the ones who do different kinds of theft. We won't do online shopping anymore. What else? Dude, this car has remote locking and unlocking. The car has a sensor and this remote has a frequency. The sensor in the car catches the frequency from the remote. Like this, every car has a different sensor and a different frequency. What use is this to us? If we have a device like the sensor in the car... we can catch its frequency. How? Take a few steps back. Okay... One, two, three, four, five... and ten! Okay! Roll Jam device. Now, unlock it. Now the car remote's frequency is in sync with this device. We can unlock any car using this technique. Including luxury cars. Yeah? Dude. This is awesome! We're going to steal cars now? We can steal them! But we'd get caught in half an hour. What then? We're going to steal the expensive items inside the car. Great one, dude! We're going to unlock every car in our way now! May we succeed in this project. Let's see who the lucky fellow is. - Dude, the battery is charged? - Yes. Okay... There comes our sacrificial lamb! Our first job is a luxury car! Awesome. It's a 5 million rupee car. Surely we can find stuff worth 0.5 million in it. Just follow him. Ready! - Let's try this? - Smile! You want a different angle? What's this new phone? For official calls. Hello? I just saw your ad for laptops... Okay... Actually, I'd like to buy it. But the price seems a bit steep. Sorry, but absolutely no negotiations. It's a brand new laptop. I'm giving it away because I'm getting a Mac next week. You won't find a better configuration. Okay... Fine, where can we meet? Where are you? Give me your number. I'll visit him occasionally. I've intimated all the websites like you asked me to. We've alerted them about the fraud in return and exchange... But we haven't got a proper response. We won't get a response. I expected that. The websites will get their names tarnished. They'll lose credibility also. How do we proceed without their co-operation? We didn't get any leads either. We will get it. It's not going anywhere! Something will open up. Yes, buddy? My personal videos. I shot them for fun during the Maldives trip. Everything is in that laptop. When I left my house this morning, I clearly remember putting it in my car. But when I got to office it wasn't there. Did you stop your car anywhere on the way? I went to meet a client. I parked outside his house. Which area? - Mandaveli. Where did you park? On the road. For about 20 minutes. Did you lock it? Definitely. - Sure? - 100 percent. See, there are two possibilities. Someone you know could have taken the laptop... to blackmail you later. Did you get any blackmail calls? No threat calls, as yet? Nothing. I think this is... just a random theft. Someone stole it. There are a few places in Chennai that sells stolen laptops. I've asked them to check those places extensively. It comes to the market within 2 days of theft... let's see. Sir, I enquired extensively... we can't find it anywhere. Check everywhere. Let's look at all online marketplaces. let's check them all thoroughly. Filter out the ads posted today. Pratap, this is my laptop! Are you sure it's yours? Yeah, I can even see the damage next to the logo. Okay, let's do one thing. He's posted it at 4:30... - Call that number. - Okay. Be casual. He shouldn't get suspicious. Hello? Good evening... Good evening, sir. Tell me I saw your ad online... - For the laptop? - Yes, the laptop... Yes, sir... Is that the final price? - Sorry, sir. No negotiations. - No issues... - Hope it's in good condition. - You can check it. It's practically brand new. I can assure you. Okay. Where can I meet to buy it from you? At Rock Stone tomorrow morning? - Hello? - Have you arrived? I've already reached. 5 minutes, sir. Little bit of traffic. No problem. I'll wait here. Sure, sir. By the way, I'm wearing a grey shirt and black pants. - You? - Green t-shirt and blue jeans. I'll call you when I reach. Okay, thanks. He says he'll be here in 5 minutes. Blue jeans and green t-shirt. When he gets there, receive him casually. Engage him. Check the laptop. If you confirm it to be yours, give me the signal. And then we'll take care. Okay, I'll handle it. Dude, cops are crawling all over the place. Just turn around. Excuse me. Thank you! Stop! - My bag... - Stop! Catch him Get him. He ran away with my bag. Get him, please. Stop running! Stupid fellow. Dude, that was close. You could have gotten caught. One policeman inside, and one outside. It wasn't a Constable or SI either. They were all higher up. They even knew your t-shirt colour! We thought we were masterminds. We'd have been caught like petty criminals. If we had been caught, it would have been ugly. Did you turn that number off? Relax, Meera. - How much money was in that bag? - 3000 rupees. She withdrew it from the ATM to pay the mess bill. - Any other valuables? - She doesn't have any... Thankfully, she had her phone in her hand. It's okay! It's okay, Meera. It was just 3000. You're okay, right? That's more important! Just 3000? You know how hard I worked to earn that 3000? I massaged the feet of so many people even as my hands hurt. You're saying it's just 3000? Fine, what can we do? Let's file a police complaint. - Oh no! - Come on, Meera. - How can the police help us? - Who will help us, then? Where will I get my money? We can't do anything! We need to be more careful henceforth. We can't do anything? It was my sincere hard-earned money... I'm crying on the road after losing it. But someone stole it from me easily... and is smiling happily somewhere out there. And I can't do anything about it... How do these people live in peace? Don't worry, Meera. He may have gotten away this time... but I'm telling you, someday he is going to get caught. Criminals cannot roam free for long. Sorry... I took it out on you. I should have been more careful. I'll be okay. I'll call you later. Okay. He sounded normal over the phone. I don't know how he smelled it. That number is switched off. We tracked the IP address from the ad posted online... it shows the free Wi-Fi at Tambaram Railway Station. Which tower was the voice calls connected to? Mostly assorted locations, sir. But it has connected frequently to towers around Navalur. Ask E-9 to tighten their scrutiny. Based on his voice... he should be under 30 years. His communication is good. He should be educated. Might be decent and well dressed. Give them these inputs and then we'll see. Okay? Worst, worst, worst... It's the worst day ever! If the police had caught us today, we'd have been in the news! And that Meera... god! Every time she said 'thief', I thought she meant us! What a messed up day. Dude, we've never done anything bad to anyone! Why should this happen to us? Don't even want to think about it. Things are going wrong... It's a bad sign. Come up with a new plan? If we proceed after all these warnings, we'll surely get caught. It's time to quit. Let's leave everything behind. Like we planned at that restaurant, we'll start a new life. But not here. Somewhere far away. We have enough money. What say? When and where are we going? In two days? Why suddenly? I told you already. Where are we going? Goa. Wow, it's an awesome place. A restaurant will do really well there! Beaches, booze and parties... the entire city is always colourful. Just thinking about going there is making me high. We're going to Goa. We'll chill. Do business. And get married. Oh, feeling shy? I don't know if Goa has temples, but even a church is fine by me. It sounds okay, but we can't wait for 2 days. Let's leave tomorrow. She is very hurry I need to sort out some things. Let's go once it's done. Dude, we have about 4 million from selling all those stolen goods. It should be enough. All these days, we partied in our life. But now, life is going to be one big party! Dude, Baga is the best place. Let's fix that! We're going to practically live at Titos Lane! Sid, you know something? In our city, people look down at us if we are drunk. But there, they look down at you only if you are not drunk! It's a great life out there. That isn't the only reason I selected Goa. In any other place, we'll stick out within a month. They'll know who we are, where we come from... everything! But that isn't the case in Goa. It is filled with a floating population. Anyone can do anything there however long they wish! No one gives a damn. Finally even we've reformed? We didn't do anything wrong for us to reform! We've just changed! So we're going to work for our money now? Right! But we will sweat... we can wipe it away! Okay! So... No more shortcuts. New life, new beginnings! We're going to live the good life! We are going to deal with the 'real play' now "Come, come, buddies; Let's go, shall we?" "Come, come! Let's go, shall we? Is this a trap? Let's go, oh let's go!" "Let's go as a gang; On a journey long." I sold the car. A bit of my savings, money from selling her bike... just pitching in what we can. It was two boys. They were staying here. They vacated only 3 days back. I got the house owner's address. Thiruvanmiyur. They lived here for a year. I've never had any complaint against them till date. I saw them last when I handed the house keys... They credit the monthly rent in my account on time. Can you give me the account details? "La-di-da - Don't ask me anything; Right or wrong - Let's heed nothing." "On my shoulder hangs a bag full of dough; In my future I see a hi-fi life for sure." "Let's go as a gang; On a journey long." I saw a superb property at Arambol. Along the beach. Just like we wanted. If we pay the advance now, we can start business in a month. - Oh, wow! - Great. But first, we'll get married at the Mahalakshmi Temple at Panjim. Shreya, okay? Okay, baby? "Drink till our heads are frothing; Jump till our nerves are buzzing." "Ink tattoos all over till we run out of space" "Fling at the casinos till we hit jackpot." "This is a new life, I'm loving this moment" "This was our dream, now it's within arm's reach." "Forget the past, journey on; The best is yet to come, party on!" Sir, we got a call from Cyber Cell. The boy's phone has finally switched on and a new sim has been activated. It's a Goa number. Current location Arambol. - Goa? - Yes, sir. Break the door. What do you want? Who are you? Police. Sir, we checked all the rooms. Both the girls got away. We missed them again. "You entered my heart, I forgot myself" "You and I became one, I lost myself." "When I am quivering from the force of your love" "You plucked my heart and stole it away" "Two eyes stealing each other; My heart bursts like in an explosion." "It's digging deep into my soul; Two eyes are stealing each other." "Stolen glances." "Stolen glances." "Stolen glances." "Stolen glances." Sir, we've alerted the airport, railway station and major bus stops. Sidharth, right? Yes, sir. - Where from? - Chennai. - What did you say your name was? - Kallis. Where from? Erode. Erode? Pachampalayam village near Erode. Your name is Kallis? It's Kalishwaramoorthy... stylized to Kallis. Do you have photos of the girls on any social media sites? No. How long have you been here? - One week. - Two weeks. How much money did you have? It was a bagful... 600 thousand. 600 thousand, huh? Are you IT professionals? I'm an app developer. He's an animator. We freelance. You took you entire life savings... and came after two girls to enjoy in Goa? What was the plan? We loved them. We came here to marry and settle down. You were in love? Do you know how many men those girls were in love with? Two years back, when I was posted in Cochin... a friend told me he was in a relationship with a girl. That he was cheated of a lot of money. But he didn't have any proof against the girl. He didn't file an official complaint. He feared for his reputation. I enquired if it was an isolated incident or a chain of crimes. In the last 2 years, 8 such incidents have been reported. All of them unofficial reports. The reason being the victim's age and their social standing. The girls have robbed millions from every one of them. I enquired some of them when I realised the gravity of the crime. None of them had any evidence. But based on what they said, I figured it was a team of 2 girls. Luckily, some of them still had photos of the jewels and gifts they gave these girls. I collected all that evidence. There were no official complaints, so I couldn't make any further inroads. Even after I got transferred to Chennai, I was trying to trace this case. But I didn't get any clue. They made sure their victims had no clue about them. These girls are the most talented criminal minds. So according to my records, you are 9th in that list. But only the girls know the actual number! That's the extent of their wickedness. But even the most wicked person has to get caught someday. And so they got caught. I struggle to steal this, but they somehow catch me! When we arrested an accused in a chain snatching case... one of the chains he had matched with the evidence I had. When did you steal this chain? Where did you steal it? I got it from this bag. I didn't know the chain was in it. - Leave it there. - Sorry, sir. Open it. From the recharge coupon found in her bag... we traced her mobile number. The number is registered in the name Swaminathan. Mylapore area. Guru enquired at the address. But we got no clues. We checked the call register, one number has been frequently called. This number is registered to Sidharth. Address is in Velachery. We came to your address. Spoke to your house owner. We got nothing. Then the new sim you got gave away your location. You didn't change your mobile. But before we got here... they escaped. Don't feel too bad. They don't have these feelings. Right now, they must be checked in somewhere... and thinking about who their next target is. Those two don't have any sentiments. This is our share, from our savings and selling her bike. We can't wait for two days. Let's leave tomorrow. I'm in love with you, Meera. I thought he was going to drag it out! Thankfully he said it right away. I'll say okay tomorrow. I'll handle his friend. I think we have a chance here... I'll give it a try. - Amjad... - Sir? These boys are our trump card. - Make sure they give a complaint. - Sure, sir. 600 thousand is not easy money. It's your hard-earned money. I'm sure you feel the pain, too. But what's more painful is getting cheated in the name of love. It is betrayal, brother. How can you forgive that and spare those girls? You shouldn't. Do as I say. File a complaint. He will catch them within a week and get your money back. Then they will see your worth. They are going on a rampage because none of the victims filed a complaint. They're not men though! Show them what men are capable of. A single complaint from you will stop them. Let's do it... Let's file a complaint. Definitely! We need to show them who we are. Wherever they are, we should find them and get all our money back. Forget the money... we know how to earn it again. Stealing our money is fine. They cheated us. It's humiliating. They need to be humiliated too. Oh, they will! Think about what evidence we may have against them? - We must have something. - Yes. We'll submit everything. They will get caught. Sir, the boys are ready. We will have their full co-operation tomorrow. Talk. Sir, we are not filing a complaint. We have lost money. Let's leave it at that. If we file a complaint and our families get to know... it will be a bigger problem. We are already hurt. Let's leave it at this. Please, sir... Let's not drag this. I don't need your complaint to catch them. If you had co-operated with me, I would have caught them with your money. It will take some time now... but they will spend your money before we get to them. I got all the way to Goa with nothing. I won't have any troubles tracing them from here. I'll be arresting them. You'll hear about it in the news. You can reach me on this in case you change your mind about the complaint. Thank you, sir. Take care. "O my dream! I was still not awake; I didn't think you'd fade away." "You've forgotten me, forsaken me - It's not fair;" "There is nothing more painful than love." "Are you real? Or are you a dream? I seek answers, will I ever get them?" "Our memories keep playing in my mind; I want it all back, will it ever return?" "You're my love, you're my pain; You're my mirage that disappeared." "You're deceit, you're lies; You're betrayal and now I'm broken." - She knows your finances better than you! - Who are you? What's your problem? I'm speaking out of experience, they'll strip you of everything! - Listen to me, you chump! - Get lost. - Dude, tell him... - Let's just go. Don't trust her. She will cheat you. I'm trying to save you. "You're my love, you're my pain; You're my mirage that disappeared." "You're deceit, you're lies; You're betrayal and now I'm broken." I didn't love Shreya like you loved Meera. You know those sale offers, buy 1 get 1 free. That was it! I got Shreya through your love. It was fun so I went with the flow. But I am actually scared of serious relationships and marriage. I am admitting it to you for the first time. She was always so sassy, so in control... always dominating me. She had never told me "I love you" even once. Nor did I feel that way. But now when I realize that she isn't with me anymore... I'm not able to accept it. Looks like I did love her, after all. So... it feels kind of weird. "You're deceit, you're lies; You're betrayal and now I'm broken." "You're my love, you're my pain; You're my mirage that disappeared." "You're deceit, you're lies; You're betrayal and now I'm broken." "O my dream!" Sorry, dude. I'm the reason for all of this. My mind stopped working when I fell in love. Making plans for getting married and settling down... I screwed up. Now I've brought us to the streets. I'm really sorry. What liquor did you drink? I can't smell it at all! You fool... I left my house about 6 years back? My dad doesn't know a thing about where I am and what I do. He isn't bothered, either. Who looked after me all these years? It was you! What do I know besides animation and gaming? You gave me everything I have. Without you, I would have been on the streets long back. Like that man there. I'm saying it again, I am dependent on you. I'm not ashamed in saying that. You are everything in my life. You say left, I turn left. You say right, I turn right. We are on the streets now. So what? I'm still here with you. If only we had a phone in this situation... I'd have mocked them with a ringtone. But they also took our phones and wallets! Whatever Simbu sings about is true. I get it now. Sid... Where are you going? Dude... That one isn't working either? None of the ATMs work. "Play the game" "He is on the flow" "Play the game" I've informed the grey market section. I'm on it. Yeah? Okay. Yes, Amjad? Sir, we need to ask the Goa police for CCTV footage from the airport and railway station. They're asking for the official order copy. Shall I proceed, sir? No need. They know that if someone complains, we will look in all these places. They wouldn't go there. Amjad, we got to the resort by 5:45 am. Correct, sir. The boys said they were up till 3 am. The girls should have left in that 3 hour gap. They have left by road, but wouldn't have risked going too far. I'll tell you what... - Amjad... - Yes, sir? Once you exit Goa... find out what the nearest airport or railway station is. Okay, sir. Check for the first aircraft or train from there to the nearest major city. Sure, sir. Once we have that, I think we will be on their trail. - Yeah? - Yes, sir. [Old Tamil movie on TV] We need to do something to them! We should find them and mess them up. We will. But they're wicked. We don't even know their real names. We know one thing... they are just like us. That's enough. We can get them. Sounds like one of those vague tweets! Please explain it to me! Simple, dude. What would we have done in their situation? First thing, we would've left Goa and gone to some place far away. Correct? We will check the newspapers, TV and internet to see if our crime has been reported. When we see nothing has been reported, that we are safe, we will be brave again. Back to business. They can't just roam the city. They need an identity. A cover-up. Just like how we have the profiles of app developer and animator. What about them? Beautician and chef. Correct. They should have started their game now. Let's do one thing. We will collect the fliers and classifieds from all the major cities. Including online ads. We will check if there are any ads for freelance beauticians or chefs. Particularly, recently posted ads. We will call up all those numbers to check. It's a big process... But if we are lucky, we can catch our darlings soon! Okay, hurry up! Thank you, sir. - Hi! - Hi! Here. It's got everything you asked for. What's the problem? No problem at all. It's been a while since I saw you. Thought I could use this chance... Sure, I believe you! You make it sound like we got cheated by two girls in Goa... lost every penny we had, and came to you with nothing! Have you just put a sticker on the free government laptop? Let that be! Please order something. [random voices overlap] What are you saying? I don't know anything about that girl. But you smiled while talking to her that day. I smile when I talk to everyone! They why are you glaring at us? Saw how I shut her up? Where is Shreya? I don't think this will work out. How long are we going to look for them? Even that DCP couldn't catch them. Let's forget that and do something new. We're also running out of money. It is frustrating! Wow, what a housekeeping! They make this towel duck in all the hotels! But irrespective of how badly we trash the hotels... they tidy it up sparkling clean like it's a honeymoon suite! Hi! You have transformed the place! It looks like a home now. She's an expert. She doesn't get anything new. She doesn't throw anything out. She rearranges the existing things... and turns it into a beautiful house. Dude, we have an identity in this city. We commit a crime. Then shift to some other city. If we use this same profile and identity there, won't they track us easily? Meera has this skill... she does something to a house and makes it beautiful. Yeah... but is that a profession? By any chance, if it does exist... Meera could have chosen that as her cover up. Dude, check this out! It is a profession! Professional Home Organizers. Professionals who advise you on innovative home organizing solutions. Superb! Let's check the classifieds we have to see if there are any related ad postings. See this. This one... Superb, dude. Which city? Just be casual. Okay... Good evening. Tell me. I came across your ad regarding organizing homes. Oh yeah, thanks for calling. What can I do for you? Ma'am, can you please explain in detail the nature of the service you provide? Delhi! Sir, the nearest railway station from Goa is Hubli. Just three hours away. There is a 7:10 train from Hubli to Delhi. I've reached the location. Let's see if something works out here. Okay. "Wanna one one give me one...one" "Wanna one one give me one...one" "Wanna one one give me one...one, baby" Say cheese! Call my number, dude. What are you staring at? Didn't you get that with my money? This is from my money too! This bag? I'm sure you bought this with my money too. I'm throwing your stuff around, and you're arrogantly glaring at me? Your money. We spent about 400 thousand. We'll return it in 10 days. We didn't come all the way here for this. There's someone looking for you... what was his name? DCP Prathap. Just one word to him, he'd have nabbed you in two days... and this money would have been delivered to us. But we didn't come for that! What else did you come for? We came for you. For your love. We came to love you all over again. We believed that the four of us would be a big, happy family. If you suddenly say it's all fake, how can we just get over it? Yeah, you thought we are like you? We are men. True love. We can't just let it go. We madly, deeply, sincerely loved you. What do you want us to do about it? Love us. This isn't working out. Dude, call the police. You get the balance money! See? Your face is changing? You're scared? But we didn't ask you for that! We only asked you to love us! That's why we didn't answer! Why? We lied. We cheated. You know this is what we are. How are you in love with us, instead of being angry? Because we're the same. The same how? We are thieves! (Song from 'Thirudathe') So you aren't engineers? You said you were an app developer? Animator? We are engineers... but we used that as a cover up. Where do engineers make money these days! So we chose a better option. More money. More fun. We didn't think about right or wrong. In fact, the only thing we did after giving it some thought... is loving you. That love made us quit everything. We wanted to start a fresh life. But you girls... We wanted to tell on you to the cops... But he said you were perfect matches for us. Crook boys and crook girls make a cute pair. What a great combination, dude! They have 'crook' written all over their faces! You didn't know who we were. We didn't know you were. That caused all the confusion. Now everything is clear... Tell us. We don't have time to think. That DCP has said he will get you both within a month. He is definitely capable. If we decide and get going, it's safe. Every day we delay is more risk. We don't know what to do. I'll tell you what to do. Simple! We need you. All 4 of us want money. We all love money. So, all 4 of us should work together. We will use our skills and do a short term project. But the amount should be huge! We only have 15 days time. After finishing the project, we will settle in some city as we planned. But this time, not in India. Abroad. Okay, dude! That is safer. If you fall in love with us in this time, that's superb! If not, that's okay. We won't force you. We will split the booty equally and leave. What say? What are you thinking? As your future husband, let me tell you... You won't find a better offer. Happily agree to it! Superb! What next? We will take the master bedroom. Darling, get it ready. You're going to stay here? Not here! In that bedroom there. No way. Stay outside somewhere. You gave us the slip even when we were in the same cottage... If we stay outside, you'll escape the next second! No way! Don't even think about that! We have your photos and details. I'll send everything to the DCP and be my own way! Hello, ladies! What are you thinking? This is our house. Go and prepare dinner for us. Such a big house for two people! You can host a reality show here. Let's slip 2 tablets into the food. Within half an hour of consuming it, they'll be knocked out. If we rush to the airport quickly, there's a midnight flight to Sri Lanka. What say? Let's wait. Let's not plan anything now. It will go wrong! Without knowing any of our details, they've traced us this far. We need to handle them carefully. They are eating it too! So we can eat it without worrying. You're making all these plans! Can we really do it? Did we doubt ourselves all this time? We didn't, right? We can do this. Whatever we do, we must settle down. We should all work together. That's all! We know the technical stuff, and you both can easily con people. Let's combine our skills. Only then we can haul a big amount in such a short time. It's not like we need to teach them all this. They must be ready! You must have started your field work after coming to Delhi. Anything useful? His name is Malik. Age 42. A diamond merchant. He tried to flirt with me at the golf course. If we plan it well, we can loot about 1.5 million from him. In just 20 days. This is Gaurav. Son of a film financier. He looks at me during dance class. He's just a little kid! In 10 days, we can get atleast 1 million. He looks at me in the gym. Name is Sunny. Son of a Minister's benami. In 15 days, we can loot 0.5 to 1 million. Suraj Mehta. A businessman. He looks at me in mediation class. He has a crush on me. We can loot any amount from him! In the few days since we got to Delhi, we've only got these 4 men on the list. We have a few more options. But to trap them properly, we need atleast a month. We don't have time. If we have to choose from these 4, Suraj is our mark. Because he is married. He has a reputation in the society. So, when he gets cheated he might not go to the police. Moreover, he is aged. So we can ensnare him easily. Also, he is harmless. We won't face any danger playing with him. It's a safe play. We can loot a good amount. Danger level - zero. Estimated time... 10 to 15 days. Fantastic! Our photos must have been on their Chennai list! That's it! I'm done. Do you know how hard I worked to make that 3000 rupees? It's my honest, hard-earned money. I'm crying on the roads after losing it. In Chennai, you were Meera. Here in Delhi, Ishitha. What's your name? Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Who are you? What are your real names? Madhumitha. Madhumitha... Varsha. You change it annually? I searched their rooms thoroughly and found their ID cards. These are their real names. Darlings are scared of us now! Another important question. How far do you go in these cheating processes? What do you mean? I mean, how close do you get to your victims, and how far do you go with them? How far did I go with you? Park, theatre, ice-cream parlour, orphanage... Damn! I'm sorry! I feel ashamed of myself. For asking such a question? Nope... For not going any further. I'm truly ashamed of that. We've only seen stuff! Atleast we've been good in this one thing. Where is he going? Think he is planning something for tonight! - Suraj. - Oh, work! If he is our mark... we need him under complete surveillance. If you play your usual games with him, we can only get a million or so. But we need to do something big! Let's analyse everything and come up with a proper plan. But we need to hurry up. Before the DCP gets to us, we should loot him and escape. So guys... shall we start? Hey, hi. Want a lift? Hi! I'm waiting for my cab. I'll drop you. Get in my car. That's okay... It's fine, just come. Okay! Wow, nice car. Thank you. Thank you. There is a huge difference from the jobs we've done so far and what we're about to do. We won't get caught only if we execute it perfectly. I need complete details about Suraj's house. - Today! - That's where we are headed next. Dear Lord. Such a big house! An area called Chattarpur in South Delhi. This place is 4 degrees cooler than the rest of Delhi. A really posh area. Everyone there is a VVIP. Suraj's house alone is about 10 acres. Highly secured house. Going inside his house to loot is mission impossible. We can try something if he gets the money out. So, it is a tough job. Okay, thanks for dropping me. Take my number. Okay... It's 9-8-8... 5-1-1... 1-1-1 Text me. - Okay. - Okay? - I'll see you. Bye! - Alright! - Good night. - Good night. This is the routine. I got his number. I'm sure he will text me tonight... We can get the information in about 2 days. You know what? This isn't you. Beyond all this... there is a superwoman inside you. Meera. I realized that in the short time I've known you. But why are you hiding all that and living a life like this? Do you really like doing this? Yeah, I like doing this. What's wrong in that? My life has been one such journey. I have faced such situations. You won't understand. When I moved out of the Home and wanted to start my own life... do you know how many people looked at me the wrong way? I thought to myself, "Is that all you are?". I decided to survive by taking advantage of their flaws. You know how it feels when I cheat every single one of them? That's a different feeling! I never felt guilty. This guy Suraj... He is married, right? Has a wife at home. Why should he behave this way with me? It's wrong, isn't it? I'll gain his trust and then betray him. That is the best punishment I can give him. How about we go shopping tomorrow and buy you a nice pair of pants? No? Delhi is cold, that's why. What does Suraj Mehta say? Nothing, really. Send him a text. Let's see if we get some lead. Their chat messages are personal. We are losing time. We don't have any useful information yet. What are his dealings? How much money does he have? Where does he keep it? We need to know everything. We need to spy him all ways possible. Keep this recorder. Wear it like a bracelet. It should always be on when you are with him. We need to know every word he speaks. Not just with you... Everything! Including phone calls. The other day, you said something about a job in Maldives. - Was that all true? - Nope! It was a lie. Why did you lie? You made the Goa plan only after I said that! Otherwise you would have bored us with love, dating and all that crap. Then how could we loot you? Superb. What about the other story? Your dad being a gambler... You fool! They were all lies. I don't have any family. It's me. And Madhu. Just the two of us. We grew up together in the orphanage. Damn... What? You're feeling bad for me? Not at all! If I'd known pretty girls like you grew up in the orphanage... I'd have run away from home and joined there. I missed it! Even though you cut me loose for money... I'm sure you really missed me, didn't you? No! Maybe you missed me a little bit atleast? No! A tiny bit, atleast? - No! - I meant I want a tiny bit of that! Nothing works with her. What? I meant we've been following Suraj's wife for two days... but nothing has worked so far. I have a plan. - Like the chocolate? - Yeah. It's white chocolate. Really special. All the way from Switzerland. Just for you. Sir... Hello? What language on earth was that? He never spoke to the other guy? No. The other guy came, gave him the phone... after Suraj spoke, he took the phone away. You didn't ask him anything? He said it was a business call. First, find out what language this is. We need to know what he said before we can form any ideas. Albanian. We will now know what he spoke. Awesome! Yes! He has 10 million rupees cash at home for a business dealing. He wants to do the transaction on the 4th. That's all the time we have. The money leaves the house on that day. We have to steal it before that. We only have 3 days left. We can't even see past his compound walls. How are we going to get in and steal it? We can! Check this out. Meera... I mean, Madhu! When Suraj drops you today, leave this phone in his car. The spy cam in this phone records a video secretively. No one can find out the camera is recording! It's a hidden operation. You can use the phone to call, text... it will continue recording video and audio in the background, without any interruptions. Casually leave it on his car dashboard like you forgot it. We can handle the rest from here. I'll see you later, then? - Okay, bye! - Bye. (Song from 'Yaadon Ki Baaraat') Call your number. - Hello? - Hello? Who is this? - I left my phone somewhere... - Hey Ishitha... - Oh, Suraj! - This is your phone? Did I leave my phone behind in your car? Thank god! I'll take it from you tomorrow. No problem! - Okay, Suraj. - Alright. - See you tomorrow. Bye! - Good night. Who is calling at this time! Dude, this isn't the time to doubt Madhu! What? [over phone] Congratulations, you are eligible for credit card. No, thank you. - Oh, this way. - Shh! Wow! Just missed it! If we had the locker pin number, it's game over. All this effort went to waste. Chill! We still got so much information. But we didn't get the locker pin number. We'll get it. Turn off the camera. Darling, did you put a bit of extra sweetness in this cup? - Get lost. - Fine! - Thank you! - Here, dude. We're in the top 5 in this trade. Isn't there any option to show subtitles while live recording a video? I can't understand anything! We are dealing with the purest form of cocaine. He seems to have a boring life! You're trying to blackmail me? Remember this... I'm the king of this trade! Take him away. Dump it somewhere. Dude, he just killed someone! Did you do your field work properly? You said he was a businessman, but he is shooting people dead! Who is he? Drug dealer. A drug dealer? I swear I didn't know until now. We're going to loot his drug dealing money. Why are we taking such a huge risk? He just casually murdered someone! Thankfully we found out now. Let's just stop everything. We will. After we loot him. This guy has a gun. He kills people. We aren't big enough to loot him. He is right. Our safety is most important. Let's stop it. Let's try someone else. Or else... We can even make do with the money we have. We don't have much money left. We don't have time to start afresh either. - Suraj is the mark. - He is a big risk! - It's a big amount! - What is big? It's just 10 million. We can swindle 5 people for 2 million each. It is 10 million. But 10 million USD. 10 million! Whatever currency it is... 10 million USD? How much is a US dollar... 710 million rupees. What? Seriously? When I decoded Suraj's phone conversation I discovered he has a huge amount with him. I didn't tell you then because you'd panic. I thought it was just some illegal transaction. But I didn't think he'd be a drug dealer. Now that we know it... let's not do it! However big the amount is, let's not do it. This is a lot of danger. Actually, not! We are very safe now. This is unaccounted money for an illegal drug deal. He can't do anything officially. If we plan it properly... we can take any amount we want, from anyone! Our plan is perfect. So we can confidently proceed with it. We're doing it! When we're talking about 710 million... we can steal it from anyone. I'm ready. I'm still scared. But... I trust you. We need Suraj's car to enter his house. We can hack his car keys to get his car. The garage has a shutter. We need to bypass it. It's very easy. I check last night. Just a small sensor operation between the car and the shutter. When the car is there, the shutter opens automatically. - You're killing it, dude! - It was on the internet! Superb. Then, we need his fingerprint to enter his personal space. A secret pin number to open his locker. If we get these two, we can easily loot the money. How? "No man is free from desire; No boundaries when you're lying." "All the glances were deception; All along it was just pretension." "Stolen glances!" "Stolen glances!" "Stolen glances!" "Stolen glances!" Fingerprint ready. This is the exact same model as the locker in Suraj's house. Even though these sounds might all sound the same... If you listen closely, every key has a unique frequency. Listen. Not just here... even our mobile phones are the same. Dual-tone multi frequency. This is the audio pattern extracted from the video of Suraj opening his locker. The sound pattern of the 4 keys he pressed... Each of them has a unique sound pattern. Now we are going to press all the keys in this locker and record its sound pattern. We'll get 10 different patterns. When we match it with the 4 patterns we have, we'll get the pin number. Zero. One. Seven. Three. We have the pin! What next? We need to leave the city within hours after the loot. If we suddenly disappear from the house, it will be raise suspicions. We will execute the plan from this hotel. I've fixed a meeting with Suraj, like you instructed. At his hotel. He will pick me up at 10 am. I can spend about 2 hours with him. That will do. - Varsha, what's your plan? - I'm going shopping with Suraj's wife. Good! But how are we getting the money out? In his car! After Suraj parks his car in the hotel... we'll use our device and steal the car. From there, we go straight to his house. Suraj's wife would be busy shopping with Varsha. The security guards will open the gates when they see the car. The car glass is tinted. No one can see inside. After we cross the gate, it's the garage shutter. The sensor in the car will open the garage door. Correct! We park the car in the garage, and go to Suraj's room. The fingerprint is ready. We need to enter the right pin of the locker. Zero-One-Seven-Three. You hit the pin! We'll steal the cash, and message you two when we're leaving. You leave your location. After we leave the car in his hotel, we come back to our hotel. We pack the money, and fly away! Any questions? Tomorrow is a big day. Sleep well. There he comes. So punctual. Even you wouldn't turn up on time. No wonder he is able to find love even at his age! Go, go! Turn right. Shut it. You follow her. It's here, right? Dude, he isn't stopping at the hotel. He is driving ahead. It's a surprise. You'll like it. No worries. Where is he going? Madhu, don't fear. We are right behind you. I can't see the car. Which way did he go? Just cut through the traffic. Dude, what are we going to do now? Welcome. Look at the stuff this White Beard is into. He needs to be exposed in the #me-too movement. What do we do now? Look around us. This area looks a bit strange. The house is half a kilometre from the gate. There is no way we can go inside, locate them, and get the car out. Drop the plan. Madhu is in there! It is a very risky place. Ask Madhu to somehow get out. Let's just escape. Madhu, don't worry. Just manage him for 1 hour. We're doing this. What happened? Nothing. He is a gangster. It isn't safe for us... Give me your phone. Why do you need a phone now? Just give it! Tell Madhu to find her way out. Let's leave this place. We don't even know what's happening inside. We saw him kill someone... Want to play a game? A game? - I'm talking seriously... - I am serious, too. Want to play a game? What are you saying? When I hacked the car keys, I found out it wasn't like other cars. It's one of the most sophisticated cars in the world. It took 2 days to breach it. In that time, I read a lot about it. This car has an autonomous capability. What does that mean? That means not just the key... we can hack the car, too! We can hack the car? Yes, it has an auto-pilot feature. So, it's possible. Dude... We don't need to go in to get the car. The car will come to us. Go on! Watch me now! "Wanna one one give me one...one" "Wanna one one give me one...one" "Wanna one one give me one...one, baby" Oh God! The shutter is over there. Dude, crouch! The watchman might see us. Crouch! - He can't see inside the car! - Right! Hey, you! Level 1 - Success. If we complete Level 2... a fistful of dollars! Dude... Draw the pattern to unlock shutter! Just a small sensor operation between the car and the shutter. When the car is there, the shutter opens automatically. You're killing it, dude! Dude, I read it on the internet! That's what it said. Don't worry. I can fix this. Normally, guys like him use the names of their wives for anything important. His wife's name is Smitha. It is 'S'. It will open now. Shit, what do I do now! Dude, actually really big shots don't believe anyone except themselves. His name is Suraj. It has to be 'S'. Why! You cheat! He doesn't believe his wife or himself! Dude, some big shots use the name of their girlfriend. His girlfriend is... your girl! - Madhu! Has to be 'M'. - Stop it! - It will work out. - Let me think. We have a way... Just a try... but if we are lucky, it will work out. We're stuck here. Do something! Madhu? Yes? I need the pattern to unlock Suraj's phone. You said something? Well, no... this is amazing! I got this from Indonesia. It costed 70 million. Took a month to have it shipped here. - Oh! - An exquisite piece. You can do this, Madhu. Just try. Somehow. Selfie? - Selfie? - Yeah! Sure... With this! Sure. Madhu, listen... It is surely an English alphabet. Just give me that alphabet. Dude, we are running out of time. Ready? If it's a random pattern, there is a way to say it. Imagine the dots in the pattern to be the dial pad of your phone. First dot is 1, second dot is 2, and so on. - Let me click? - Sure! Oh, it got locked. Eight... Five... One... Nine... Six... Two... Four... Seven... and three! Like that? Yes! Awesome! Superb, Madhu. You killed it. Give us 30 minutes. We will be there. Go in! Dude, this way. Oh, that's a fridge? Zero-One-Seven-Three. Yes! Dude, ready? Yeah! I thought earning is tough, but stealing is tough too! You were right, dude. Dude, some Indian currency here. Let's take this too? No, we never know when they'll devalue it! Oh, come on! We can at least pay at the toll booths. Fine! Varsha? Done! Leave the place. Yeah. Excuse me! Hold this. Madhu? Success! Adjust for 15 minutes more. We'll be there. (Old Hindi classical song) Ishitha? Are you okay? Dude, careful. Oh, God! Ishitha... wake up. Ishitha! Guard! Where are you? Madhu, are you okay? Doctor! Nurse! Get a stretcher quickly. Quick! - I've turned off the mobile. - Are you okay? Dude, we don't have time for this now! We should flee to some other city with the stolen money. Not just some other city, we need to go to some other country! How are we going to go abroad carrying so much money? We'll get caught at the airport. I have a plan! You get ready and check out. Ready? We're going to Thailand. By road. Thailand? Straight to Manipur from here. From there, we go to Burma and then Thailand. It's going to be awesome! Okay? Ready? "When two eyes steal glances; Dreams are within arm's grasp." "Let's spread our wings and fly; Love is within our arm's grasp." Who is that? Why is there so much traffic here? Isn't he that DCP? Dude, it's Prathap! What are we going to do? Oh god! What now? Why is he doing checks here? Okay, Ghaziabad is about 30 to 40 kms from here. Clear? I'm scared. Why are you scared? I'm here. I'm here, too! Dude, let's leave. I'll come soon. - Let's go? - Sure. Oh lord! Come back safe. I'll just... be right back! - Dude, it's time. - It worked out! - Girls, careful. - Bye, baby. Hello, sir. - What are you doing here? - Sir, it's you! You came here to catch the girls? I told you he'd get them, didn't I? Superb, sir! You are awesome. You must have noted the car number. Relay it through the walkie immediately! They shouldn't cross this street. - We need to nab them today. - Which car? Sir, what do you mean? Those girls just got-away in a car. You didn't see them? - It was a white car. - Those girls? They are getting away. - Sir, they're going there. - How did you know those girls are here? Sir, we... Sir, where did they go? Did you miss the car? You saw the car? - Damn. - Come on, sir... Sir, there they are. To the left... Sir, it's a red signal. Oh wow! - Sir, what was that? - That was awesome! - Sir, go faster... - Straight. - Oh damn, we missed it. - All the cars are white... DL1C 33 554 A white Innova, right? - Sir, you're at another level! - Wow! We only told him it was a white car. But he knows the number! - That's the car. - Oh no, they are leaving the country! That's the one! They're definitely getting locked up. We shouldn't spare them wherever they go. Today, they are done for! - Right there... - That's the gate! Sir, it's gate 4. No, 5! - Where did they go? - Sir, wait! Dude, that's them right? Where, dude? That white top? - Where? - At the check in. - Oh no, they're checking their bags in. - You don't see them? - We can't get them now. - I'll take care. - Sir, they are getting away. - Those cheats are escaping. Oh no! Please stop! I need to check out somebody who has gone there. - Show your ticket. - I need to apprehend someone. - Sir, your ticket please. - I'm a cop from Tamil Nadu. Please show me your ID, sir. Shit, I'm not carrying my ID. It's in the car. In the car? We're losing time. Sir, listen to me. I'm a cop, I need to go check out somebody. - This is a case! - I'm only doing my job. - Sir, superb! Go get them. - You are the best, sir. Catch those girls and put them in jail. That's it, sir! Hello, where are you? All okay? No problem at all. All okay. Sid, come quickly. We're getting scared. Don't get scared. Just stay tight. Just 2 more minutes... the police will be there. You're going to be big shots. The Delhi Police, national media coverage... it's going to be a lot of fun! Sid, don't play around. Madhu, we are done playing around! Game over! It's simple, Madhu... You lied about loving us and cheated us... so we got angry! Our egos have surfaced. We hunted you down and said the same lie. We used you to make several times the money you stole from us. How is it? Now, we're even. God tests men. But doesn't abandon them. He gives a lot to women. But abandons them in the end. See? He abandoned you now! Dude, a punch line from me! Madhu, why should boys always be the ones who gets cheated? Let it be the girls this time! Okay? Varsha darling, why are you silent? Have you been played? Have you been fooled? You shoot such a cool look every time. Say something, dear. You're shocked already? We have the entire loot money. Don't think the money is in those bikes and plan something! I don't think the bikes even have petrol in it! Okay, Madhu. Take care. The police will be there. I'll really miss all your lies. Your photo will be in the papers tomorrow... I'll cut it out and keep it in your memory. Okay, bye! Bye, Varsha darling. Hugging you felt awesome! - Bye, sweetheart. - Hang up, dude! What do we do? We deserve this. It really pains, huh? I don't know why... I don't feel like running now. We were just fooling around! Dude, looks like they actually loved us this time. Their eyes are teary. That's because of the game we played on them. We don't have any money. Everything is in those bikes. Even if you want to escape this moment, it's all yours. We decided we will take the money only if we get your love. We're awesome, right? Boys like us exist only in cinema! We are like a rare piece. Dude, we are beyond logic! Both of you are very lucky girls. So, why are we still waiting? Hug? Oh, I need to count to 3? One... Two! Let's fall in love? I love you, Meera. Sorry, I meant Madhu! A charge-sheet has been filed against you. What have you done, Prathap? It's unbelievable. You were in Delhi to catch an important suspect in the match fixing case! During a severe search at the hotel... you abandoned it and went to the airport, and breached past the security. What have you done, Prathap? Sir, I was after a suspect. Isn't that our job? Every case is important. Stop it! The department told me about this case. It's only a cheating case. They've looted some money, yes. But why would you create a chaos? What's your obsession with that case? Is this how a responsible officer behaves? What happened to you, Prathap? Really? Wow! It looks beautiful on you. Like it? - Do you like it? - I love it! When I saw it, I thought of you! I thought I must buy it for you. It will always remind me of you. That's so sweet. Thank you so much. You make me feel like an 18 year old. Not fair! - Pink suits you. Necklace... everything! - Thank you. Yeah... Jessie... I have to tell you. You're so beautiful. No one here would have seen anything as beautiful. No, I mean that! And... I think I'm in... Never mind! Forget I said that. Don't look... Hot! - I mean, it's really hot. - Is it? I don't feel it. This is complicated. Media pressure, too. Sorry, Prathap. The police department can't help you. Do something and try to come out of this mess. Sir! What's this? Sir, their caps were fixed with infrared lights. It's one of the methods to cheat any CCTV camera. Sir, we've got the official order to check every single vehicle. Your money can't leave Delhi. "When two eyes steal glances; Dreams are within arm's grasp." "Let's spread our wings and fly; Love is within our arm's grasp." The visa documentation is all done. We'll be in Thailand in 2 days. We are settling down in Ko Samui. All set! How did you arrange everything from here? We have a tent full of dollars. Anything is possible. Once we reach Thailand, I'm getting a sandwich everyday! I meant to eat! I'm on a diet now. What happened? Now I will never forget your name. My real name isn't Madhu. Thenmozhi! Thenmozhi? Yes, dear. Sorry... I was about to tell you. Fraud! I know you so well, so I didn't get a real tattoo! - Who is the fraud now? - What is your real name? Find out for yourself. Forget that, her name is Thenmozhi! She is a country bumpkin who trapped me into falling for her. Your real name is Kaaleeswaran. You are a country bumpkin, too! "I feel, I feel... I feel like flying in the sky." "I feel like flying in the sky." "I feel, I feel... I feel like flying in the sky." "I feel like flying in the sky." "Like the bird that soars in the sky; My heart is flying."
