We'll be able to see the Fort from the top of the next rise. There she is, Fort Lincoln, base of the finest cavalry regiment in the country. And our home. What's the matter Tom? The guys from flag isn't flying, it's a good three hours before retreat. - I wonder what's happened. - I don't know. - See that little gully there? - Yes. Take Ma'am and the crew of pack horses, stay out of sight and I'll come for you. - Tom, I should... - Now, don't worry, I won't be long. Just keep under cover. Breck, Calhoun... Lacy, Dekker. Go on, call them louder. - Call in the mood of the dead. - Charlotte? But you're not dead, are you Captain Benson? You're standing there alive because another man died in your place, my man. Charlotte, get hold of yourself, what's happened here? You were Custer's favorite. Why don't you ride out to Little Big Horn and ask him what happened? And ask him why he put Captain Jim Reynolds, my husband in command of C troop, your troop. When he knew that Jim wasn't fit for doing service. You knew it too. You know that Jim hadn't recover from the wounds he got last year fighting the Sioux. It's your great general talking. And he died in your place. Tell me, what you're talking about? Did you bring back your bride to be Captain Benson? Look at me, I was a bride too, an onomie bride. What, what happened here? Dead, all dead. All those who were with Custer. Massacred, slaughtered. Sitting Bull making big medicine with the so braves around the fire. And the Sioux squaws, with the knifes in their hands... amongst the bodies of our dead they wounded. And my Jim, warned to dead. Bates. Oh Captain Benson's. If you'd got and excuse it better be a good one. It got out of hands, Captain Benson, good old captain, you're on your honeymoon sir? - Kruger. - Yes sir, old Sergeant Kruger dismiss sir. I'm only going to ask you one about this. When the regiment left, I was detailed to pro those guards. To keep these prisoners and drunks from getting out of hand. When I heard about the news and how it happened, I decided to let them go. I didn't think that you be kill like rats in the trap. Specially if chief Crazy Horse and his braves decide to jump the fort. Yes sir, old Bates here is a regular little Napoleon, giving orders... - is like a major general. - I had to let them go. Because they're the only men we have left to defend the post. But they got out and sack the stores. - Got into the liquor. - So? Get them on their feet and fit for doing. Alright, bright and shine, the wake is over. Present, arms. Rest, arms. Bates, Kruger, come with me, The rest of you men, take your post. Here they come. All is left is 5 troops of the 7th cavalry. Looks like the squadron went down with Custer wasn't the only one... had a rough a time in Little Big Horn. Ed. - Ed... - Hi. It is Vic, Custer's mount, isn't it? No sir, this is Dandy, the general second mount.. They're boys and hard to tell apart, the general was riding Vic's. But you were with Custer too, you were his beagle model. I was this winter, when we go back snack into the hole Sioux nation. General Custer sent me back with an order to Captain Benteen. Was the only lucky one sir, Nothing is back from Custer... If general don't send me back with that order... Morrison, is it true the whole of C troops is wipe out? They never had a chance sir. They're outnumbered 15 to 20 to 1. The Sioux had Winchester repeater against our one single shot and more ammunition. You know that country Captain, we scout there together, it's bad. Looks flat but it isn't. Full of dips and rises that can hide 10,000 until you're right in the middle of them. Soon the Chayannes seems to come out right off the ground. I saw it all from the top of the hill, 5 minutes after I moved away. Been seeing nothing else since. Will go on seen I guess, over and over and over again. A darn day. Just saw it won't come as a surprise. I'm asking for a transfer out of this outfit as soon as I can write out a request. - Before we square things with the Sioux? - Do my squaring thing with another regiment. This one station is not my concern. Want to know why it happen Bob? You can read all about it in the official reports captain. All of you were there, you most know. - I'm not prepare to venture an opinion sir. - If you have an opinion I want it. What is this? A one man court of inquiry? I had a reason for wanting to know the truth. Worried about your General's reputation? I tell you one thing, the precious little of the last ones if truth is known. Come on, get it off your chest whatever it is. Alright, I give you my opinion. Little Big Horn just probe what I thought of Custer all along. He thought he was god almighty and couldn't lose in any situation. - I want the facts. - And I'll give you the facts. He disobey orders. Deliberately set the stage so if there was any glory he'd be the one to grab it. That's why he had our men butchered, Custer is no better than the Indians. I'm sorry, Bob. I lost my self-control. Seems as if you do your best fighting in the officers quarters. - Miss Kellogg? - Yes. Where is Captain Benson? I don't know Mrs. Reynolds, probably going about his duties. Duties, how convenient? How very convenient everything is been to him. Are you trying to suggest that Captain Benson left his post... to bring me back knowing that General Custer was going to attack when he was gone? Captain Benson was closer to General Custer that anyone. He must've known his plans. - Can anyone actually believe that? - I can believe it Miss Kellogg. - Why do you believe it lieutenant? - Personal reasons. You understand Miss Kellogg that we all have the greatest respect for you and your father. I believe we were discussing Captain Benson. Very well. So one, I never consider that Benson belong. He wasn't West Point. If that enable to make up my mind just exactly where he was. Are you implying that Captain Benson is not a gentleman? Yous Captain Benson fiancee Miss Kellogg, you certain must... be well acquainted with of his background. You tell me. Professional gambler, in the river boat. A faro deal before he come in the service. I think he knew what was coming, decided not to stake his life in such a mad gamble. So he appeal the Custer well known sentimental nature and back off. Fetch you from Fort Supply. If I were a man lieutenant Fitch, I'd know how to answer you. You maybe gone too far Bob, you forget her father is Colonel Kellogg. Her father shares my opinion about our gallant Captain Benson. Why didn't you come to Captain Benteen's? Oh, I'm not exactly in the mood for social calls. Hardly a social one. Tom, why didn't you tell me about the river boat? About been a gambler? I wanted to, we talked it over the general and I. We decided that was nobody is business what I was. You could've told me. But it's all in a long dead past, not that I'm apologizing for it. Did you think, did you think it would change things? I know your father, a general of the old army school, he's not to fond of me, you know. You weren't marrying my father. I wasn't so sure I'd be able to marry you until I practically carry you off. - I'm sorry I had to hear from someone else. - Fitch? Wouldn't had been Fitch would be someone sometime. He made a passage once, on the Silver Queen, my father's boat. - I don't care what... - Wait. I want you to hear it all, from me. I dealt Faro on the Silver Queen, I did a lot of other things. I was drifter, flesh one day, built the next, good looking bad. Between seasons on the river, I scouted for the army, that's how I met George Custer. He saw me on the army, and brought me into the 7th Cavalry. But I'm glad this story about the Silver Queen came up... because it makes a little easier for me do something I must do. You going back to Fort Supply. - When are we leaving? - I'm not, you are. I'm not going anyplace without you. Don't you understand? The daughter of colonel Kellogg... married to one who would always be known as the man who won't there. Oh Tom, the blame is killing you as a culprit. When your men might've needed you, you weren't with them. - My place was with them. - And my place is with you. So I feel if the man I love needs me, I wasn't with him. Oh, is no use Martha, it's best yo go back. At ease Morrison. I guess I've play taps over a thousand times since I've been in the army sir. But tonight's somehow is, is different. Yes Tonight I think I really heard and understood for the first time. It's a sad cause, sort of like saying good bye to old friends. - A Requiem for the regiment. - Yes sir. I won't be seen you for a while Captain. I'm riding through to Fort Supply, with a dispatch to colonel Kellogg. - Is miss Martha know? - No sir, I just received the order. Major Reno is insisting in Colonel Kellogg come here to... conduct a court of inquiry into what happened out there. - I know sir, you wanted to be there. - Thank you Morrison. Good afternoon Charlotte Mrs. Brennan Mrs... - You send for me sir. - Yes, I did. Been sighting your request for and escort to take Miss Kellogg to Fort Supply. - It is refused. - On what grounds sir? One, not sufficient men are available for such an expedition. Two Miss Kellogg states that she is no intention of returning to Fort Supply. Which I can understand since her father is coming here. I'm sorry disappoint you. I suppose when you asked for active service it was you intention to command her escort. Such was not my intention. When I asked for active service I asked for duties related to my rank of Captain. Very well Benson, I'll see what I can find for you to do. Detail, attention. Dress right, dress. How's the mind of the fallen? I hadn't happen to take of much scaredy recruits to the rifle range. He asked for assignment, the adjutant sure took care of him. Don't worry about him, he's already taken care of. If his brother officers had their way their bury him with the rest of the garbage. Capt Benson wasn't the only one who had other business when he should've been with Custer I don't seem to recall you were there. One, two, one two. Detail, halt. - At ease Benson. - Good afternoon Colonel Kellogg. What is this? Recruit target practice on their way of wide range sir. - And you're in command, on foot? - Yes sir, it's a special duty sir. Your daughter Martha will be happy to see you. - Are the two of you married yet? - No sir. Good. Forward, march. Gentlemen, as you know I'm here to conduct an official investigation... into the reasons of this shocking defeat. By direct order of the President of the United States. It's my duty to establish the truth, the elements that led to this disaster. Who is to blame? Why did Custer divided his command? Where were the officers and their men who could've supported him? Were certain officers derelict on their duties? At the height of his career as an Indian fighter. A brave, experienced officer lead 5 troops of cavalry to their deaths. Where was the rest of his command when he died? Why was Custer unsupported in the hour of his greatest need? Major Reno... the support of you battalion could've saved Custer, don't you agreed? I, I don't know sir. Surely you know how desperately he needed help. No sir. Come now Major Reno, you were there, you knew what was happening. You had guides and scouts and messengers. Commander like Custer would never lose contact with his officers. That was exactly what he did sir. Are you suggesting that he didn't ask for support? Yes sir, as a matter of fact, was he would promised to support my battalion. You have orders to that effect? My orders were cross the Little Big Horn river and... charge the Indian the edge on the other side. I was told by the adjutant that I was to be supported by the whole outfit. - You carried out your orders? - As far as I could sir. Until I found myself under a murderous attack faced by impossible arms. We seem out numbered 10 to 1. I send a messenger for the support I'd been promised but never came. My battalion was forced to fall back to the river. Isn't it true then that with your withdraw let the Indians free to massacre Custer? I couldn't help him sir, I had to try to save what was left of my battalion. - But your orders were to engage the Indians. - They weren't feasible. Custer foolishly divided his regiment into... 3 battalions when he should've kept his command intact. I object to that statement Major. You're condemning the general's decisions without explaining why he made it. I'm not interested in why he made it. I only know it was an invitation to disaster and it came. It's easy to assassinate the military military reputation of a... - dead man who's not here to defend himself. - Order, order. I'm not allow this proceedings to be interrupted. Particularly by an officer can only theorize about the battle. - That's all anyone's doing... - Sit down Captain. Were you also unaware the fact that your General did support Captain Benteen? No sir, I knew he need it. I received and urgent order to join him and bring up the ammunition banks. - Did you obeyed that order? - I tried. Just what you mean by that captain? The Indians were attacking when I came to the river. I thought that was general Custer who's been attacked. I form my battalion in lines and moved up to cross. But when we was close enough I saw was that Major Reno battalion who was in trouble. - I order my battalion to help. - But your orders were to help Custer. There was no way through, we faced a horde of savages arm with repeating rifles. Rather than has my men charge that force of Indians... I joined forces with major Reno platoon. Together you could've charge the Indians, but you withdraw, why? Half of Major Reno's men were already dead or wounded when I joined him. Go on would've been suicide for the rest of us. A supposition captain, not necessarily a fact. I exercise my judgment as an officer. But by doing so, you knew that... your decision was abandoning your commanding officer to his fate. How could I be certain of that sir? Why not Captain? When you're so sure it was suicide to join him. - Now, listen Captain Benson... - Captain Benson... I'm quite capable of conducting this investigation. You will remain silent or I have you removed. Now, both of you officers appears to have tried to carry out your orders. Apparently, didn't tried hard enough. Whatever his orders were sir, they were premature. - Premature? - According to field order in your desk sir. Custer was instructed to await the arrival of General Givens infantry on the 26. Instead, he went to gaze Indians on his own, on the 25. Obviously you went into battle... with no feeling of confidence in your commanding officer. Captain Benteen, did you have confidence in Custer and in his plan of battle? How much confidence can you have in a man who refused to believe the reports... of his scouts when they tell him that his not only facing the whole of the Sioux nation... but thousands of Cheyennes as well. A man who insisted he can defeat all the savages... ever gather together with one regimen of cavalry, - The 7th Captain. - Yes, the 7th. Colonel, these officers are trying to cover their own mistakes... - I've been very patient with you Benson. - This is any investigation... this is a whitewashing party at the expense of General Custer's. Captain Benson, you're confine to quarters... until tomorrow, this time I'll inquire into your conduct... seems to be very open to question. - How it go darling? - Words, words, words. Forgive me my dear, I haven't had the chance to speak 3 words to you since I got here. I even been had a chance take a good look at you. Little pick-in. Then this to be expected, a long ride from Supply... and what you found after you got here. It's one thing I devoutly thankful for, you're not married to Benson. Father I, I want to talk to you about Tom. I'm afraid there's very little that I care to discuss concerning Captain Benson. - Less now and never. - Can you just listen to me? I've tried to forget you dislike for Tom for my sake. I've tolerated it for your sake. Don't ask me to change my opinion. I'm going to marry him if he'll have me. Marry a man who's practically an outcast from the service? A man is been annihilated and punished for no good reason. - He's complained to you, I suppose. - He even commented, just takes it. Thick skin, eh? Doesn't matter to you how, how I feel about the way he's been treated? It matters a great deal my dear. It was to spare your feelings that I close your interest in Benson since the beginning. I know it to be a mistake, a dreadful mistake, that you'd have reasons to regret. I've no reasons to regret. Tom Benson is more than just a gentleman... by act of Congress or by appointment of the President. When he came to Supply to get you, to bring back here you were his bride. I couldn't lock you up, confine you in chains. But I told you I'd never him as a son in law. The general Custer executive and his closest friend. At the moment General Custer's preference... hardly constitute a recommendation for anyone. Then I can even beg you to help stop this prosecution. I got to do my duty my dear. And that duty includes an inquiry into the... circumstances the absence of Thomas Benson from his command at a time of dire need. You know Custer gave him his permission to come and get me. That is yet to be officially establish. Why don't you go on him? Try him for cowardice? - For desertion in face of the enemy. - I'm sorry for you Martha, terribly sorry. Please don't do. The more you drive him, the further down I'd go with him. Martha... Stay you name, rank on the section, for the record. Thomas Benson Captain, 7th US Cavalry, commanding C troop. Now un-existing. Of all the officers in the regiment, you were the one closest to General Custer? Had he discussed this campaign with you in advance? Did he ever discuss the campaign that turn in disaster with you? He did sir. And you knew the purpose of the plan action? To round up the hostiles up the reservation and return them. Custer thought this was an easy task, I suppose. General Custer been in too many fights with the Sioux to believe that sir. And why did you request leave of absence to pursue your private affairs in such a time? I absent myself with a direct order of General Custer. - But you did absent yourself? - Yes sir. Captain Benson, you know that General Custer was once... court martialed for absent himself from his command in order to visit his wife? Col. Kellogg, I consider that statement... highly improper and prejudicial on the part of presiding officer... of this investigation and completely irrelevant to the proceeding. I need no instructions as to help conduct this investigation. Then you should know the difference between hearsay and evidence sir. Have you a copy of this order granting leave?? - No sir. - May I ask why? General Custer permission for absent myself was verbal sir. What you're up to this verbal leave of absence? A private discussion of my affairs sir. In a inquiry such as this I can not rule anything is private. Very well sir, I accept your rule. General Custer was aware of the difficulties I was having in... persuading a certain young lady to become my wife. Do to objections to our marriage in certain quarters sir. I see, General Custer was acting cupid. General Custer was a great human been sir. What was the exact nature of this verbal orders... grant you leave to pursue an affair of the heart? - You want his exact words sir? - I do. He said Benson, I want you to show enough conscience to drive off to Fort Supply... bring back that girl and marry her. If anyone stands in your way by refusing to be a party... to the happiness of his own daughter... then by god forget the father that I find a way myself. I would give anything to see his face. - I was only quoting General Custer/ - He deserves it. I really didn't like to do it, but he asked for it. I wonder what the finding will be in this case. Oh, the good old English verdict... not prove by reason of insufficiency evidence, a stand off. I can't prove the General Custer did authorize my absent. They can't prove that he didn't. But one thing. I'm going to held your father to return me to useful active... duty or quick me off, one or the other. Will you stop worrying? - Attention. - At ease. Gentlemen, I just received an order, an order of the President of the United States. It says in part... a burial detail will proceed to the valley of Little Big Horn... to the purpose of interring the bodies and marking the graves... of the 7th Cavalry not properly buried. The bodies of the officers will be place in caskets... and returned to Fort Lincoln for shipment to their families. Burial detail? But sir, the President doesn't seem to realize the impossibility. The country around that battlefield is so swamp with hostiles. Crazy Horse and his braves are drunk with victory. Worse than that. Sitting Bull is declare that ground big medicine for the whole Sioux nation. You moving there with troops, they'll be down the next like wolfs. But a direct order from the President must be carried out, somehow. No matter what the quarters call but sir, I'd like the assignment. You're aware of the risk involve? Yes sir and I don't believe that will disturb too many people. Very well... it would be an impossibility for me give you more than two troops. A force of that size would defeat your purpose, as major Reno states... to move into that area openly with a force of any strength... would be to invite another massacre. Perhaps the Captain intends in going alone. No Lieutenant Fitch, I'm moving in with volunteers. But Captain Benson, attend to reason, if one thing is sure... - What's the matter sergeant? - It's suicide, plain suicide. I mean they're out there, they think they own the country. Small party wouldn't have a chance. - Say you're refusing the duty. - This is for volunteer, Is that what's troubling you sergeant? - If you got the guts to go... - You volunteering then? - What is the duty sir? - I'll acquaintance with the detail later. Just see that this men and supplies are fit and ready to move out at a moment notice. But you got the name of every scoundrel, drunk... no good guard house, rat and shark on the whole outfit on this list. Hey, you wrong, they're all volunteers, even if they don't know it yet. Yeah, volunteers? Alright, get set volunteers, your captain await you. I'd like to fix the captain's wagon for him. You won't have Joe, it's been fix. Yeah, but he's still the best troop commander in the outfit. Well, what's happened to you Kruger? Getting really like him. They getting soft in the head Kruger. It's alright by me that Custer body left where it is. Oh no, you can't do that. We are picked men, the captain picked us himself. Yeah, you know why? Because we've been living in borrow time, we weren't with Custer when we should've been. Oh, blow his nose Dickson, I think his going to bust our boy. - Coffee is good. - Don't change the subject now. Did father give you this assignment or did you ask for it? - I asked for it. - Truth? Truth. You come back hear. Form platoon, right wheel, forward march. You're going to kill this whole outfit with you're force marchs. You look pretty healthy to me Bates. As for the other men, a little hard ride in the sun is good... for them burn some of the guard house beef of their bellies. - Ok, you're the boss. - That's right, I'm the boss. ♪ The Captain is in a harsh marrying he feeds us saw and corn and bean... ♪ ♪ While he is living beyond his means the captain lives a harsh marrying. ♪ ♪ When the enemy comes of course he run... ♪ ♪ He's not go out the cavalry. ♪ ♪ The colonel daughter loves him too. ♪ ♪ For his a fellow the cavalry. ♪ Bates. - Yes sir. - Bring an ax. I tried to warn these smart monkeys about the liquor, both of them. A drunk, what a drunk? That's Rich. Now, wait a minute. We need that liquor captain or no captain to keep the stink of this job out our noses. Well Bates. On your feet. Reveille at 4 A. M. Indians. No Bates, I want to take him alive. Dixon, Vogel, come with me. Boozer, right to the creek. You trigger happy fool, I told you I want to keep him alive for questioning. I didn't know you wanted to take him home for a pet captain. - Bury him. - Yes sir. - Take maybe you shot the wrong man Dixon. - Maybe you got something there. Well, he said bury him. You had first gun of yours, you hadn't killed that lousy Indian... we wouldn't be step up here like a sore thumb ahead of the column. Well, I don't let that Captain Benson get me kill him... - not if I get the chance of hitting first. - Yeah, alright now is his chance. They left us a warning. Sitting Bull no want no white man, in the valley of at Little Big Horn. I guess you're right Bates, he's made the battlefield his personal big medicine mount. And when take out these bodies will disturb his medicine. Little Big Horn is now a Sioux holy place, one of their religious believes. Us coming in here it's like busting into a church the Sioux build up. - That's it. - Right here is when we turn back. - I gave no order to go to the rear. - No, but that did. Burial unit? We'll be the ones to be buried if we don't hit that warning. You want to take orders from Indians, why don't you ride up and join them. Forward, go. What he's trying? Get us all killed? Nervous Vogel? There's no danger, yet. That's what the Captain says. It's crazy, you got eyes, even you can see the Indians up on them hill. - Yeah, all can see them. - Seems he's riding to another ambush. Those braves are sitting up there just buying their time... we walk into a trap we can get off, they'll butcher us. Is there anyone else beside Vogel who can read Indian minds? Vogel, come with me, we're scouting ahead. - Ride out there alone? - Follow me, that's an order. - Must be a couple of miles out of the camp. - Dismount, Vogel. - Eh? - You heard me, get off that horse. You've been doing a lot of talking since we started this march. In front of my face and behind my back... I figured from getting now, we'll all have a chance to get out of here alive. Bates it turned back, the men are in their beds and let us. Sure, as soon his head back to the post, keep on his way where we can back it. - It may be too late even now. - No, no, it's not to late. Them Indians won't bother us as long as we don't disturb the medicine ground. Care with using a gun, a shot will wake up the whole camp. I ain't going to use no gun, remember that Indian I got shot back there. Took this off as a souvenir. Vogel, Vogel... - Ii is your friend. - No sir, is no friend of mine. Was a soldier, we're in the same outfit. - Get a shovel, bury him. - Yes sir. Allen, help him. Well sergeant, I wouldn't expected this, but I want to thank you. Oh, is nothing personal in what I did, I'd do the same thing for any man. Oh Miss Kellogg, I'm Corporal Morrison ma'am. I've been off on detach duty riding through to Fort Supply. Yes? I just rode in carrying a message from Bufford and I heard about Captain Benson. - About the Court Of Inquiry I mean. - The inquiry is over corporal. Yes ma'am, but it is true that Captain Benson couldn't prove at the inquiry... that the General did order him back to Fort Supply to bring back you miss? - That's right. - But he can prove it now miss, by me. - By you? - Yes ma'am. I was standing right besides the General when he... give Captain Benson the order to go, he said... You mean you were actually there, you heard him give the order? I did and I swear to it. But why didn't Tom say this at the inquiry? I guess you know better than we do, he's a proud one. You never know what wonderful news you brought me. I so like to give him that news but... my own horse is pretty used up, so I'd like to take Dandy. General Custer's second mount, it's the fastest thing in the post. Would you get the Colonel permission for me please? I will corporal, go on. With Dandy under me I'll make good time. Corporal, god bless you and tell Tom I love him. - Yes ma'am, I tell him that, good night. - Good night. Hey, that horse Morrison was riding, wasn't it Dandy? Sure you know what? It's General Custer's horse. The valley of the Little Big Horn. The man we've to bring home are down there, waiting for us. To think of the bodies of officers, the President said, bring them home for bury. What he didn't said is how you going to tell which one is the officers? No marks, no nothing. We don't even know which grave is Custer's. Yes we do Bates, I located the burial this morning myself. Oh, you got eyes that see underground, I suppose. Sitting Bull himself marked for us. There it is. Kruger, Vogel, Bird, bring a spade. Sitting Bull own coup stick to mark this favorite part from the others. A tribute of one great leader to another. - Yes sir? - Dig here gently. Captain Benson. Now they got us right when they want us, all boxed in. Keep digging. You're the man to get us out of this place, we all follow you. They come in peace to recover the bodies of their dead, as we would do. Their dead belong to us, the victory belong to us. - If I can make them go in peace. - They go and leave, without the Yellow Hair. If they go in peace and leave big medicine, till I sleeping, we shall let them leave. But if they refuse, they shall die. He's making the sign of peace. - I come in peace. - You're welcome in peace. - I am Young Hawk, seven chief of the Sioux. - I'm Captain Benson of the 7th Cavalry. Warriors of the Sioux and our brothers the Cheyenne had... painted their faces and taken up their weapons. You're defiling sacred ground. We come to honor our DEA according to the white man costume. But it's strange that a yellow Sioux chief speak... the language of the white man so well? From my birth to my 12 year I was rear by white man. And taught by white men on an army post. Therefore, I know what's in the hearts of your people and mine. But you must know it, we mean no harm to your people. You do not understand, this, all, is now a part of my people. A part of their lives, a part of their faith. The spirit of the dead had been reborn again in the bodies... and the souls of the Sioux and Chayanne braves. Even the spirits of their horses had passed on into the beings of our own ponies. And Custer, the great warrior of the Yellow Hair lives now... in the hearts and the minds of the Sioux. He hasn't god our braves with his own bravery and wisdom. Transmitted to him through his birth, which is in our keeping. But Young Hawk knows that such a believe is only superstition. As the white man believe in the miraculous power of his own saints... and the truth within the teachings of his own face, nothing more than superstition? Is the believe of my people... that if Yellow Hair body is removed, his spirit will go with him. And the fruit of our victory will be lost. The great chief of my people has ordered me to bring Yellow Hair home. To lay among his own kind and let him rest. My people will never let him go. That's the end, if this a choice between the dead and the living, we take the living. As long as we're alive Captain... me and the man have decided what I've known a long time, you're not fit to command. I'm taking over. Bates, you and the men know this mean Court Martial. We're not going to sit here and get what Custer got, we're getting out. I'm with you, sarge. You going to stay here and carry out orders. You going to stop us Captain? All by yourself? You're the fellow who believe a man should've a chance for his live, remember? Not this time, it's you or all of us. You pull back that hammer Bates and your dead. Put out the gun Kruger, this is between Bates and a superior officer. Bates told you that the Captain is crazy when he's already saved two troops of the 7th... by coming in here with a gang of scoundrels like us to do men work. Kruger, it's an order put up your gun. Well Bates go ahead shoot, and you're ready been in command. You won't have to worry about me, you have nothing to worry about but Indians. Are you watching them? Their set base, ready to charge. You give the orders Sergeant, tell this men how to save their hair. Oh, come on Bates, get it over with, take command. What's the matter? Haven't you the guts? I guess I'm the one that's nuts. This ground is sacred, it must not be stain by war blood. You're heart had proven that is heart of a Sioux brave... but there are times when he thinks with the man of a white man. Get your mounts used them in wagon for barricade, move. You two men get moving. Come on your guard, help go Bricks. And you can prove them Indians you're troopers. You, you heard what the Captain said. No rifle will be fire against them. No lance will hurt their hearts. No arrow will bear into their bodies and they will die, perhaps more slowly... but just as sure. - What are they waiting for? Reinforcements? - I'll tell you what they're waiting for? They're waiting for us to die. Not from bullets, from thirst. That sun will swell up my mouths, we're sure it is death. We're surrounded, cut out from water and everything else. Bates, he wanted to be with Custer. Well, let him, not me. - Vogel, keep here under cover, you idiot? - You're the idiots. Couldn't think how to save you like rats in trap, not me, I'm getting out. Is the General's horse Dandy. They're falling back. Indians think is spirit of the General's horse, they think is Vic. Kruger, sound the charge. Hey, look at them Indians, look like their stuck by lightning. That's the answer, their sure it's Vic, the horse they buried with the general. They think it's returned from the grave to help us and Custer spirit is in the saddle. Get this wagon moving, we're going to mount and ride. You heard the captain, come on and mount now. I want you ride out of here as if those Indians weren't there. Column of twos, forward, ho. I've had deeps dreams in my time but they couldn't talk of this. The spirit of Yellow Hair spoken. I congratulate you on the way you conducted your mission. It'll be reported directly to the President. Can you forgive a man who's for once in his life time acted... more the anxious father than an officer in the army? Yes sir, if you would forgive a man who for once in his life... acted more as a bride groom than this troop commander of the 7th Cavalry. Captain Benson, about face.
