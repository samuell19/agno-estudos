Yeah, man. Did you see my grades? You're telling me. I gotta make a speech in front of the whole class tomorrow and I don't even know what I'm gonna say. That's what happens when you're a goodie two-shoes and you wanna be a valedictorian. You're just jealous, Eli. Jealous, I'm walking with y'all. Yeah, just barely. Remember she used to stay after class in Mr Wallace's class? To do the extra credit? Extra credit, man, that was a crush right there. A crush. I did not have a crush on Mr Wallace. Well now that I think about it, you can't talk, remember Christie? The weirded out girl that likes you? Man, quit with that. Hey, what about that one girl you liked? The one with the eye condition, what was her name? Oh what was her name? Left eye Susie? - Yeah. - Left eye Susie. She was always looking in two different directions. No, that's not, that's not funny, she had a rare eye condition, she got it fixed. Yeah, cause she was staring at you and all the other guys around you, huh. You ain't special. Hey Blue, what time is it? Almost noon. Wait, what? I gotta go guys. I'll see you guys later. By Che. Ayo, Cheo, what's up, man? Hey, what's up young Chip. How are you, Jeff? Good, just getting ready for the big day tomorrow. Okay, what's new, what's new? Not much, you know, just school, music. How's Christina and the little homie? Oh you know, they're good, man. Just taking up all my money playing their sports. Running me amuck, man. Speaking of money, I should charge you double for this haircut, bro, with that big ol' head of yours. Wow, that is a double priced head. Holy tomato, my god, wow. So any bites in the music industry, bro, or what? No, I haven't heard anything back yet. But I'm starting to think that I need make my own sound, you know? Something different that's just mine. Yeah man, I don't blame you. Yeah, I'm done with mix tapes. I want a DJ sampling my music. Abuelita always said, work at something you love and you'll never have to work a day in your life. Sounds like good advice. Hey bro, can I help you bro? You get those sideburns taken off or what bro? What is your relationship with the Lord? Ah man, we don't got time for that, bro. Mighty Lord Jesus Christ says, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Marvel not, I said unto you, you must be born again. Hey bro, no one wants that here. This is a place of business, man, get out of here. Jesus guy. The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God. Dude, there's some bums out there that need to hear that, bro. Get out of here with that. Hey Cheo, whatever you do, don't be like that fool, man. He's nuts. Okay, Jeff, you've really outdone yourself. Yeah, man. I'm gonna be walking in the auditorium lookin' firme homes. Lookin' blessed, homes. There you go, man. Ah man, don't worry about paying me bro. That's your graduation gift, bro. Really? Yeah, we're good man, we're good. - Man. - You know what I'm saying? Thanks for the love, yo. All right man, good luck out there. Orale. All right man, be cool. My head ain't that big, is it? Nah. What up, bro? Hey, what's up Cheo, how's it going? Not much, just got back from the barber shop. Big day tomorrow, huh? Definitely. You ready? I don't know, this beat is tight. What you know about this song? Well when Rocky came out, it really stuck with me. I was looking all over for it. Kool and the Gang released that song a few years before Rocky, on Light of the World, now that's a must have album. Yeah, I'll check it out. Hey, is this any good? Haven't had a chance to listen to it yet but let's slap that bad boy on. Sweet. Yeah. He's got himself a nice hook. This is where they get it from. Good call on this one. So I hear around the neighborhood that you wanna get into music. Yeah, got any advice? Well, what you know about Miles Davis? Who? Duke Ellington? James Brown, godfather of soul? You know. No, bro. Ah Cheo, come on kid. You gotta know the past before you can help create the future. How can you be the best at what you do if you're not familiar with the greats? You got me there, you're right, bro. Hold on, wait here, I got something for you, be right back. Take these records home for a few days and learn about some real music. Really? Yeah, this here is gonna take you to another level. These are better than any college music course. Sweet, thanks Roland, they're in good hands, I promise. Okay, get out of here, I gotta get some work done. All right, Roland, talk to you later. Hey, Cheo, what's up? Comin' from school? Yeah, just got out of class. You been skippin'? Man, that counselor, Mr. McCann, he be trippin' bro. Straight up cheating off of credits. Talkin' about how I gotta take summer school. I didn't want to be there to begin with, now he wants me to take summer school? Chale homes. Maybe if you weren't skipping, you'd be graduating tomorrow. School ain't for everybody carnal, we'll be here workin' the Low Low's for now. Let me see what records you picked up, man. Hey, who is John Col-tran? I don't know, some jazz guy. Roland gave me these records to listen to. Says I should study up on them. That same junk that Beethoven was playing? Beethoven? Sad girl, he likes that Beethoven music that you do. It's not classical music, stupid. That's jazz. Same junk, right? Hey, you ain't got no oldies or soul up in there. Nah, that's not the style I'm kinda goin' for. But hey, I'll see you Chava, I gotta run, all right. How come you don't like to hang out with us anymore? Big Happy, give Cheo a sip of your 40. I'm good. Hey Sad Girl, think Cheo might need a little tenderness. Bet you know who sang that song. Odis Redding, bro. And hey, I'm cool Julie, I've got a big day tomorrow. It's Sad Girl, Cheo. No disrespect Julie. All right then bro, next time, hang out for a little bit. Startin' to think you don't like us, homes. Come on bro, we grew up together. I'm trying to get to bed early tonight, all right. Hey, want one? Nah, I'm cool. You always do straight leg stuff. Enjoy your classical music and Col-tran. Col-tran, Chava, you need to expand your horizons, man. I hear you're gonna graduate tomorrow, baby. Hi Ms. Mary. How's it going? I am so proud of you. I sure wish Mr. Reuben was here to see you graduate. I wish he was here as well, I remember him telling me all the stories. Yeah, yeah. You got some new records there? Yeah. Is that Duke Ellington you're holding? Roland said he was a must have. Well, make sure you open your window when you playing the Duke. Reuben sure did love Duke Ellington. Will do Ms. Mary. Yo Cheo? I gotta go, okay, have a good day. My brother, my brother. What up E? Sup man. Ay yo, what you got, you always got the good with you. Bro, check this out. So I went down to the shop today and Roland really hooked us up. Gave me a couple records to listen to some new sound, he says if we really wanna make it into this music business, we gotta know where the music originated. Whoa hold up, man, Roland did? Man that guy never let's me borrow anything. Bro, chill out, there's a first for everything. Let's go to my crib. Bro, you stink bro. Man, dude, your room smells. Let's see, yo, think fast E. Man, quit with that, you're always playin' around. Yo, you hungry? We got some nice juicy tortillas. Nah man, I'm good, I already ate. You know, actually bring me some juice. Yo, E. - Sup man. - Here you go bro. - Thanks man. - Yeah. Yo this is fresh. Yeah. Man this is fresh. Yes. Yo bro, that's the breakdown. Pretty cool. Yeah that one. Come on, I need the headphones too. Your old headphones? Just get the headphones. Man, I told you you should get new ones already, man. You wanna buy 'em? Man, here, listen to your music. Ah, check it. Yo, man we gon' definitely have a good night full of something like this. Bro, I'm telling you, this is gonna change the direction of our lives in music. All right, let's see, let's see. Hey throw the next one on. You got it? Yep, play it. Oh okay, this is a game changer, boy. Give me that. Man what is this? Yo, Roland gave me this track. This is the game changer bro, listen to the arrangements, something different. The arrangements, the pacing and the timing, something new. Man, are we listening to the same track? We'll never get another gig if we play this crap. What are you talking about? This is art, man, clean out your ears. Dude, how we gon' use stuff like this? You gotta think outside the box. We do pretty well DJing man. Yeah but, it's already played out, I'm trying to do my own thing, don't you? What you mean your own thing? Oh think you're a hot stuff without me, huh? Nah, man I'm just saying I wanna do something new. Something that gets my creative juices flowing. Well if we play stuff like this, your fan base is gonna be people who are like, people like Ms. Mary, man. Oh you'll definitely be a hit at the senior center. Bro, you're taking this a little too personally, man. I'm just trying to mix things up. Well maybe we should do our own thing. I do all the scratching at the gigs anyway. Hey man, back off. Hey man. Eli, whoa, why you shoving me man, why you getting so mad? Yeah bro, you made it pretty clear you wanna do your own thing with your own sound, you know, I'ma help you out, I'ma open up this window, so you can play this trash so Ms. Mary can listen to it. Bro stop being like this. Nah man, I thought you were different but I guess you're on Cloud 9 since graduation is tomorrow and you've already decided to leave me behind when you're done with Jefferson. Bro, you're not even, what is going on? Nah bro, you've done lost your mind. You don't have to do this old music to be better than you. You had no talent when we started and this, this ain't gon' help you out one bit, man. One bit. You know I'm out man. E, yo! You know what, that wasn't my intention at all but you want it to be that way then fine, E, go ahead, do your own thing man, you're done with this for some reason so I'll just stand back and do mine. In all these years I've known you and Eli, never once have I ever, ever heard you guys exchange words like that. Oh it hurts my heart to hear you two argue. You know, Cheo, the Lord says there's a friend who sticks closer than a brother. And no matter life throws at you, you love that boy, you love that boy like you do your own blood brothers. Yes ma'am, I've gone through most of my life with him, I don't know what happened. I don't think he was a huge fan of those records I brought home. I have a bunch of old records just sitting in the garage if you wanna take them with you. Really? Yeah. Right through that door. Right on the shelf by the wall. Right on the top shelf, sweetheart. Whoa, you got a great collection Ms. Mary. You can take them with you, sweetheart. Reuben would be happy that you're listening to his music. I have my radio now so I don't play records anymore. That was Reuben's thing. Are you sure? This is a lot of records. You could probably make some good money off of these. Yeah, but I'd rather keep them in the family. Thank you Ms. Mary, I'll put them to good use. Oh and one last thing, you know sometimes in life, people aren't gonna like what you like. And that's okay. But you have to embrace the differences in people. But don't compromise your choices while embracing theirs baby. Now you go get some rest for your graduation tomorrow and have a blessed day. Will do, Ms. Mary, thank you. Hey Cheo, Cheo! Hey can you come down? Yeah, hold up. Hey, what up Blue? Hey. You okay, Che? Yeah, I'm all right. I've had better days. I also got some new records from Roland and Ms. Mary. Yeah, I heard you down the street with the East Side Boys going over records. I also heard that Sad Girl's all over you. You got it for her now, cause I thought we made a marriage pact. Me? I'm never getting married. Plus who marries they're best friend? Well I'm holding up my side of the deal. Oh I finished that poem that I told you about. Will you help me go over it? Wait, what poem? The one I've been telling you about for like two weeks. Dude, what's wrong? I'm sorry Blue, it's just that me and Eli had a huge fall out and I don't understand what happened. I brought some records home and we just got into it. Yeah, I heard. Who told you about it? No one, these walls are paper thin, I can hear everything. Well what else did you hear? Just that Sad Girl's all over you like a cheap suit, look like you liked it. She was just looking at the records I got. Mhm. You know what Blue, I don't know how you do it but you always make it seem like you and I are in a relationship. I don't have time for no Sad Girl crush. What records did you get? Too many to list. I actually just got done listening to a few tracks and I already feel inspired. It's crazy. You know you're really cute when you talk about music. Oh gosh. I'm serious. I know, that's the problem. You know, Che, you and Eli are better friends than that. Things will get better, just give it time. Yeah. Can you come out tonight? I wanna show you something. What do you wanna show me? It's a surprise. Go get your jacket. I think I can. Shouldn't be out too long though, dinner's gonna be ready soon, okay? Okay. Be back. Okay so what's up with these records you got. Which ones did you get, you never told me the names? Well I did get a couple from Mr. Roland and from Ms. Mary. Yeah, yeah, you said that, but what? What records, like what bands? Right, right. Duke Ellington. Okay. Miles Davis. I recognize that one. And then, what was the last one? I know, I know, what was it? Where'd you find this? I want a low rider one day. How'd you find this? Will and his friends did it, cool huh? This is tight. Is it a '65 Lincoln Continental? '64, look at the tail lights. Okay Blue, I see you know your low riders. I'm telling you, we're rolling in one soon. All good things come to those that wait. And have money. Remember, these cars ain't cheap anymore. Especially when they're all hooked up. You don't need hydraulic. But you want 'em, I guess. Yo, Cheo. Sup, dude. Happy to see you here. Yo, back off. You're in good hands here. She just makes it a little nicer here, that's all, boy. All right man, we were just leaving. Hey Cheo, tell you brother Vinicio said what's up. You need to hang out with us again. Us East Side Boys, you know what I'm saying? All right man, let's go. Love watching you walk away girl. What you guys do today? Some new music comps. Played some games. Here you go boys. Thank you mama. Thank you mom. Vini, put your phone down. This again? Everyone else eats nice meals every night. Plus there's never enough. It's not enough? Not enough, Vinicio? I already work two jobs. Why don't you just get another job, ma? Yo, Vinnie, shut up. Why you always complaining? If we were white, we'd have more money and we'd have better food. If you don't like it then you can get out of here Vinicio! I've had enough. You should be thankful I didn't hit you. You got anything else to say? I blame dad for ruining this family. You never take responsibility for your actions. Enough Jorge Emilio. It's true mama. Why is it that every time you guys get into it, you always have to bring up dad. Quit defending him Cheo, he doesn't care about you. What makes you think that? He's always happy to see me. It's a just front Cheo, he doesn't love you and he didn't love mom and he doesn't love any of us. That's not true. Oh yeah, then why hasn't he come visited us in years and he only lives two blocks away. You see what you did, this is why we don't bring him up. He's not a father figure, he only cares about himself. He's just nothing but an abusive piece of... Sit down! Well I'm thankful for what we have. Thank you Cheo. Mama, tus frijoles son los mejores. I can't get enough of 'em. We just had it last night. Cheo, mijo, there's a package for you, please get it out of the doorway. Who would bring you something? I don't know. What does the box say? Where's it from? Okinawa, Japan. Okinawa, Japan? That's Jetty. Oh you know how expensive that postage must've been? Mom, you're right, it is from Jetty. It was him. Cheo, I'm sending you this keyboard from Japan. By the time you receive this package, it'll be three months later for me. Make your own music, you have it in you, and this should help you get there. I love you guys and miss you all so much. Take care of mom, I'll be home soon, Jetty. P.S. happy graduation. Que regalo, Cheo! A keyboard, how did he know? It's definitely no boxing glove but hey, it looks expensive. Man, so what the hell did Jetty send us? Don't let your brothers mess with this gift. Your brother Jetty worked very hard to be able to send this to you. I will mama. I'm a free man, Roland. Hey look at this guy, all graduatin' and everything. Good for you kid. Could've kept these records for more than one night. Yeah, I know. How'd you like 'em? Man these were sick. They changed everything. I feel like I can really use these to make something dope. And what stood out most to you? That's gotta be a trick question. Well, Miles gave the Duke a run for his money but the Duke dealt with an entire Big Band so I gotta give it to the Duke. Miles? The Duke? We're on a first name basis after one night? Well, Ms. Mary gave me a bunch of Mr. Reuben's old records. Ah, Ms. Mary, of course. Tell me more. Well, Miles got this straight up funk to it's sound, but James Brown, took that funk to a whole 'nother level. I don't know, I guess I just love it all. Damn boy, look at you here with your high school diploma and your knowledge for proper tunes. Welp, I couldn't have done it without you, Roland. It ain't everyday I find someone bit with the same music bug as me. Now, go do somethin' big with it. That's my plan. Hey Roland. Hey what's up, Eli. Hey so what was up with those records you let Cheo borrow, you never let me borrow anything. How'd you like 'em? Want me to be honest? My dad would have liked them. But it wasn't my cup of tea. You gotta expand your mind, boy. So where do you think most of the sounds come from, from today? I don't know, man, artists make them up, I guess. Oh no, no, no. See, you should've listened closely to those records that I sent home with Cheo, you'd understand it would've been in the vinyl. Man, that music, that music was wack. There ain't nothin' there for me. Yeah, whatever kid. Hey man? No hard feelings or what. Come on man, don't worry about that. You know we're still homies. I got your back. Trying to roll out? Let's go. Let's go, man. All right Rol, see you later. All right, peace out kid. Hey man, let's go get Blue and get something to eat. What? So what man, you love her yet or what? You're trippin' bro. We're just close friends, it's Blue. Yeah man but does she know that? You know what, just call her over. I will. But hey, now that I think about it, I've never met someone as creative as her. Especially when it comes to writing and music. Plus Blue is way out of your league. Bro I could recruit her for my team anyway. What you talkin' about you? She wants a hero, not a zero. So what are you calling me a zero now? Dude, relax, I'm just messing with you, man. But anyway, about the graduation party, you coming over or what? Yeah man, if I'm still invited. You were never uninvited. Plus we got a couple hours to kill. All right man, let's do this. Let's grab a quick bite to eat, we'll pick up Blue and then I'll drop you off back at the crib. I've gotta go to the store to hit up some things for the party, you know. Good job Cheo, I love you. Sup man. Sup E. Finally did it. We heading to the top. Bro this is the beginning of our lives in music. Speaking of music, check this keyboard I got from Jetty, it's sick. Dude? Yo, can we just get this party started or what? All right everybody, just wanted to thank you all for making it out to my graduation. I see a couple of graduates out there. Just wanna let you guys know that this is a new beginning, not just for me but for all of us. Hey play some of that Col-tran. Come over here, Chava. All right everybody, settle down. I got one quick announcement, this, my boy Chava, we grew up together and today is his graduation too. Get that big 'ol head over here. It's a degree in body shop repairs and rehab of the tightest low riders in Daly City, I hereby declare you a graduate of the school of hard knocks with a degree in life studies, give it up to my boy Chava. Now let's really get this party started. Here, listen to this. See this sound is like so bomb, it needs to be on the radio today. You know, appreciate you're my biggest fan. Well, my only fan. Your encouragement really keeps me going. Hey Cheo, come here. I'll be right back. Why are you listening to this lame stuff? What are you doing later? Later, isn't it already late? Yeah but there's always a later. So why they call you Sad Girl? Should call you Bad Girl instead. But I ain't bad, I'm sad. Who says you can't be both? How'd you get so sad all of a sudden? You were always happy growing up. That was before guys took advantage of me and broke my heart. Who broke your heart? No matter. Don't seem sad to me, Julie. I told you to stop with that Julie stuff. Hey, let's go to the liquor store and get some drinks. I got Blue and the boys here, just kick back and chill. Okay, show me your room then. Let me go check on everybody just make sure everyone is cool, okay? Don't keep me waiting too long. Chale. You okay? Yeah I'm fine. Yo E, can you take Blue home? I live next door. Eli, can you walk her home or what? Yeah, man, anything for you, right. Mr. Big shot. All right E. Bro, you good? It's about time. What are you waiting for? Get over here. Hey, I got you those frozen burritos. Che? Hey, you don't answer your phone? I got you those frozen burritos. Yeah, thanks Blue. It smells flowery in here. Are you hungry yet? You've gotten three full compositions out. Yeah, sorry, let me just finish this last hook on here, and then we'll go get something to eat. How's patron sound to you? Sounds good. Sweet. This next performer, I've known for many years, I've seen and heard his growth in music, he has mastered the integration of today's popular hip hop sound with the past generation in ways I've never heard before. But first, he has written and composed a brand new song that he's gonna preform for you guys tonight. With his lead singer, Julie Torres and I want you to give it up big for my man, Cheo Colorado! ♪ Don't like to give him much credit ♪ ♪ Or pay him any mind ♪ But he's somewhere lovin' ♪ All the time ♪ Believe me it's so good ♪ That's got to be an evil ♪ Always sneakin', sneakin' ♪ So you better be careful ♪ Always out there, out there ♪ And they call him the devil Michael, I'm glad you were able to make it out today. This is the young guy I've been talking to you about. I think he has the sound that you've been looking for on your roster. I like it. How did you find the kid? I have never heard anything like that. Ah, he's a boy from my hood. He's always had an ear for music and he's been teaching himself arranging and composing. Introduce me to him when he finishes his set. I think I may have found what I am looking for. Give it up for him, give it up for him. All right, I hope you guys enjoyed yourself at Roland Record Summer Series, my showcase of new and up and coming artists. It's been a wonderful day of music, wouldn't you agree? Let's make some noise for this lead singer, let's go. ♪ You, you think I'm gonna fall so easily. ♪ ♪ Na, na, na Hi, may I have the pleasure of introducing you to the sound of tomorrow, this is Cheo, Cheo this is Michael Deville, owner of Deville records. Son, you had a very impressive set here today. Let me get right to the point. I want to sign you up. I think I can use you. And also I'd like to record your last composition on vinyl. Why thank you so much Mr. Deville, it's an honor to meet you. I really think that this music is gonna be the new way for our generation. Roland was quite right about you. You have got ear for music and arranging. Do you have any representation? Do you have a manager, agent? Um, I kind of just represent myself. Roland, he's like my manager, I guess. Here's my card. Give me a call sometime soon, so that we can schedule something. I want to do everything official. You bet, Mr. Deville, thank you so much. It was nice meeting you, Cheo. Roland, take care. All right, we'll be in touch. Thank you so much, Roland, thank you. For everything you've done for me. I told you. I didn't think everything was gonna come so quick. Kid, I told you, you did all the hard work. All I did was identify talent. People love working with true talent. So, enjoy the rest of your day and get in contact with me in the morning. All right? Will do, thank you so much, man. So you wanna come out or? Come out where? We could go and grab something to eat. Yeah, when Cheo comes out, we can go. No, just me and you. What, Eli? Just me and you hang out somewhere, you know? You don't want Cheo to come. Nah, just us, you know. Yo E, can you pop the trunk? Is it hella cool in there? - Yeah. - You sure? Hey Eli, can you give Sad Girl a ride up the block? Yeah, man. Sweet. Hey Blue, can you move over and make some room, please? Yeah, whatever. Did you ever get this door fixed? Man I'm broke, just get in. Hey, thanks for the ride, bro. I think today went really well. Yeah man, I'm surprised they actually liked your old sound. Even that old man from the record label. All right man, let's get the trunk. Hey I thought we were gonna have a bite and talk about the concert. Uh let's take a rain check on that Blue, we'll talk about it tomorrow. Sweet. Hey Julie, why don't you sleep with the guys on your own block, huh, Cheo's way out of your league. Whatever scrappa, I could get any guy in this neighborhood or any neighborhood. You're just jealous. Cheo's nothing like the guy's in your neighborhood. He's actually gonna get out of here and make something of himself. You're just some trashy distraction. Why don't you let Cheo decide what he wants? 'Cause last night it seemed like he wanted me. I don't see him inviting you into his bed. You don't even know him. I know him enough to know he looks good with his shirt off. That's more than you know, isn't it, ninita? I'll see you tomorrow, Blue, let's go. Hood rats these days. Compositions, compositions. This is starting to feel like a job, this isn't fun anymore, not with all the pressure. How are you doing, mi sentimental? Isn't obvious? I feel horrible. My music sucks, Michael Deville called last week, talking about he wants to meet in five days to hear some new tracks. Don't say that, you're just stuck. What do they call it in the music biz? Writer's block. But it feels like it's much more than that. Here, I'll help you relax. Am I gonna be all right? Baby, you know I wouldn't be wasting my time with you unless I thought you were gonna be something, right? So what's up, did you do it? Yeah, he's all messed up thanks to you. And you. Don't pretend you have nothing to do with this, all right? Is he in there writing, though? He's wired, he could barely string together a thought. You got my money? I'm a little short right now, I went down to Roland's and I spent more than I should have. That's not gonna work for me, homeboy. How about I go tell Cheo where I really get the good stuff from? Nah, come here, come here, come here. You know, here, just take it, it's all I got. Just take it. That's more like it. So what's up, you free tomorrow night? Yeah, have fun. Hey what's up man? How you doin'? You doin' good or what? Pretty good right about now. Are you ready for your meeting or what? Come on, let's hear it. Come on. No, no, come on, come on. Come here. Hey Eli. Hey, what's up? Hey just sit down, listen to some music. Fix it. What's going on? Nothing, he's just about to get ready for his meeting. No, Cheo? Cheo, what's going on? Nah, it sounds good man, keep it coming. It doesn't. It sounds good. Are you hearing the same thing I'm hearing? This doesn't sound good. Cheo, your hooks are completely off beat, your arrangements don't even mix together. Where are your full compensations? Just keep on playing man. You trippin', you always be trippin'! I'm trippin'? Dude, he doesn't even like your music, do you hear him? It sounds good, he's getting ready for this meeting. You got something to say, what? I just saw you on the street kissing Sad Girl and now you're in here, what are you up to? You're over here accusing that he's on drugs, maybe you're the one on drugs. Saying that I'm with Sad Girl, I'm never with Sad Girl, all right. I just saw you! That wasn't me. Oh really, that's weird because that person was wearing your same outfit. You're tripping, like I said. Cheo, what is going on? Okay, are you okay? I think you need to leave. What did you do to him? Just go, you should just go already, man. No! Just go. You go. Hey Cheo, just keep playing that stuff. Keep doing it man. Cheo, you just need to rest and stop playing. Just get out. Just get out. Why should I? Get out! You obviously don't want to protect him and I actually care about him, Eli. Did you not listen to what he just said? I don't care what he just said, he's obviously on something. He said get out! Just get out already! Leave! Nah man, just sit down, dude. You're doing good man, you're doing good. Hey man, you need some of this or what? Hey, you good? Hello, Cheo, how are you doing today? Doing quite well, Mr. Deville, thank you for having me. So I wanted to let you know, I received your file this morning. I listened to it and let me just cut to the chase, I'm not impressed. I didn't send you anything by mail. I have my own stuff here, look. Well I received something, it had your name on it. But regardless, I'm not sure if this is the right timing of things, if you understand what I mean. No, I don't understand. Well, Cheo, I might have jumped the gun a little bit too soon with you. To be honest, I don't even remember what I listened to last month's Back at the Summer Series. Please, Mr. Deville, I've been working really hard and I'm ready to take you up on my offer. I'm not sure what you received this morning in the mail but I promise I have something you'll be interested in. Please, if you would, just listen to this track and see if you like what you hear. Any minute now. I'm sorry, Cheo. The deal has been revoked. We are moving forward with a new artist. Welcome, Eli. Hi. Nice to meet you. Please have a seat. We listened to your tape and it's exactly what the boss wanted to hear and the direction this label wants to be in. So Mr. Eli Cole, we're hopeful and thought if you could start off by selling a million units, you'd be on track to lock in a two album deal. A million units includes domestic and foreign sales. Just so we're clear. Yeah, we're clear but what do I receive up front? It's not as black and white as it normally would be. Your sound has potential. You had a great response from our focus group and our firm would like to build around your sound. So we're cutting you a check for 250,000 dollars with the deal that you product one album to start with. All studio expenses and engineering time will be covered, of course. And any remaining profits from potential units sold will be added to that 250k. But just think of this as sort of an upfront signing bonus, if you will. Mr. Cole, Michael loved your sound. And he wants to move forward with you. We here at Deville Records know that you have what it takes to be the best. Which is why, we'd like you to sign a contract. What do you say Eli? Do we have a deal? An opportunity like this only comes around once in a lifetime. I'm in. Awesome, Eli. Welcome to the team. Thank you. Your family has been looking for you for months, I had no way of knowing what happened to you. Are you listening to me? I once knew a girl name Blue but you seem nice. Let me take you out of here and get you clean. I can take care of you. You have anything on you, I could use a bump right about now. No, just let me take you home now. I don't have a home. I lost it. I'm not Cheo. I can't watch you die like this. I love you. Really? Yeah. Crystal Blue. Can I tell you something? Yes, anything. Go on and get yourself a real man. Forget about me, you don't deserve this. No. I can't watch you die like this, I love you. Cheo, the Lord says there's a friend who sticks closer than a brother. Foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God. Lord, if you're real, help me. Son, son, do you need help? We don't want anything from you, we just wanna help. Men, please help this young man. Yes, we can. Take him to the intake room and get some clean clothes and dinner. Yes, let's get you cleaned up, brother. Warm food in your belly, get you a clean bed to sleep in. All right. There's some food here for you. Lord we thank you for this meal, and for the nourishment of our body. And Father, we pray Lord, for those Lord, that are still in wilderness. And are lost, that are homeless and most of all, Father, that are hungry. Lord, we know you're a merciful God, and we thank you Lord, in the name of Jesus, amen. Amen. Hey bro, I'm glad you feel safe. I heard them bringing you in last night. So, do you guys do this every time you eat? Well yeah, you know, a little prayer, you know, it keep us thankful. By the way, where you from? I used to live in Daly City, up on the hill, near the East Side. East Side? You know what, you look familiar. Do you have a brother named Jetty? Yeah, that's my older brother. - Oh! - He's out of the country. He's actually in the marine corp. You know what, I was there when he enlisted. Really? Yeah man, you know what? He had way more guts than me. So where am I? What is this place? You're at the New Hope Home and Pastor Donna brought you in last night. It's by Christ that she found you when she did. Where is this Jesus, can I meet him? We're about to have Bible study. Today can be the first day of the rest of your life. Is Jesus gonna be there? And what's a Bible study? Well, he's already there. And he's waiting for you. And he's directly down that hall. Hello, Cheo, so glad you could join us today. Thank you Pastor Jesus for allowing me to stay here last night. You called Pastor Donna Jesus. I'm Pastor Donna. Today we'll be learning about Jesus and how much he loves us. No one would love a failure like me. People look at the outside but Jesus looks at your heart. Can I meet him? You already have. He brought you here. Men, I trust you've all met our new brother, Cheo. Cheo will be staying here for awhile. - Great to meet you all. - How you doin? Welcome. Hey there brother. Great to meet you all. This is a safe place, Cheo. We've all made decisions we regret, including me. But our future doesn't have to look like our past. I know it's a lot to take in but essentially we have two choices. We can keep doing things the way we always have or we can begin to fill our hearts with the immeasurable love of Jesus. Fill my heart? Yes, Cheo, the choice is yours. Hi, Pastor Donna, do you have a moment? Sure, c'mon. So I've been doing a lot of thinking this past year. I've come to realize that I've taken a lot of things in life for granted. I'm praying over a situation and I was hoping you could impart some wisdom, on something important. Of course, Cheo, what's on your mind? It's Blue. I've taken her love for granted since we were kids. And she's always been there for me. I made right with the Lord and I now I wanna make right with her and ask her to marry me. Cheo I'm so happy for you. I've seen how Blue looks at you. You'll be the missing puzzle piece to her heart. You really think so? Is there something in particular I can do? Yes, I was hoping you could help me find the perfect engagement ring for her. I would love to help you. I'll tell you what, how about we go first thing tomorrow morning, will that work for you? That's perfect. Wait, are you sure that's not too early? It's not every day I get to help someone from our group get married. Thank you so much, Pastor Donna. It means so much to me. I must be a real slow learner, here she was right before my eyes, this entire time. Thank you for asking me, Cheo. We will have a ball picking out the perfect ring for her. So yesterday after Bible study, I was talking to Pastor Donna. Okay, what about? And, forget it. Why'd you bring it up if you weren't gonna tell me? What'd you talk to her about? Hey! You hear that? What did you talk to Pastor Donna about? Not right now, Blue, come on, look.

I'm just running late, so I gotta go. No, ma, why you in such a rush, stay. Cheo's waiting. Are you scared of us or something? I think she's scared of us, Archie. I think so too Robbie. Girl, you look so good. What perfume are you wearing? You smell good, girl. Hey, hey, not too fast, wait! Okay Blue, okay, you wanna play? Come here! No, no, no, no, please. Watch it. Archie, Archie, let's go, let's go, come on! Come on, Archie! From looks of it, it was about 30, 40 minutes ago. Okay. No. Sir, sir, can you come this way please? I heard the screaming and I looked out through my window and I saw these two men and they were brutalizing this young woman. Okay, did you get a good look at the gentlemen? Yeah, I see those punks around here all the time. A couple of losers, total losers. Wait, you said all the time? Yeah. You wouldn't happen to know their names, would you? Oh, um, one's name is Ronnie and the other one's name is, let's see, Archie. His name is Archie. Can you remember anything else? No, it all happened way too fast. Okay, that's fine. All right so, we're gonna catch those guys. If you remember else, please give us a call. - Right. - Right. Thank you sir. You can go ahead, I'll show you around. Thank you. Ma'am, last night a young girl was found murdered. Oh Lord. We believe she attended your church. We found this brochure on her. Also the library card that was found on her body stated her name was Blue Tahara. Oh no. Did you know her? Yes, I know her. She was about to be married to Cheo, one of our ministers. I'm sorry, does she have any family in the area? I know she has family here but I don't know. Cheo will know. I'm just afraid this is going to devastate him. He'll relapse. Would it be okay if I tell Cheo what happened to Blue and call you back later with the contact information? Yes, of course. Here's my card, if you think of anything, please, give me a call. Thank you. Cheo? Cheo, I need to tell you something. I don't know how to tell you. The police were just here. Blue's dead. They found her in the park. We're gonna get through this. We're gonna get through this. I know, I. Why did this happen? Hey, what's up Cheo? You gonna come in and let me buy you a drink? Chava's up in here. I heard about what those punks did to your old lady. They'll get theirs when they get into the pen. The pen'll take care of that for you. We live in a fallen world bro. Punks about to live the rest of their lives behind bars. That's not living, Guillermo. That's deep Cheo. But a couple shanks to the heart and lungs, would feel good too, you know what I'm saying. It was good seeing you bro. All right, bro. Chava, can I talk to you for a moment? Yeah, I heard about Blue. Sorry, man. How are you holding up? This has got to be one of the hardest things. And I thought fighting addiction was tough. Don't worry about it, Carnal. We got your back with whatever you might need. There is one thing you can help me with. Tomorrow's Blue's funeral. She loved low-lows. I was hoping you could get the horse together. For you and for Blue, let me know what time, we'll be there, okay? Thank you, bro. Keep that head up. This place hasn't changed one bit. Cheo, is that you? Mama, Vinnie, look who I found! Cheo, mijo, you're back! I missed you so much, welcome back home. Man, I haven't seen you since the funeral. Why you so skinny? Is that a cross around your neck. It's for the best, but I missed you guys all so much. So did you bring us anything? Yeah, me! You ain't nothin' special. Never said I was. You asked if I brought something and, bada-bing, here I am. So mom, are you still working at the airport? 18 years now, mijo. Getting ready to retire, I wanna travel. Why didn't you stop by? All that matters is that you're happy and you're back home with us. Thanks mom, and I was actually at the New Hope Rescue Mission. Why? What was at the New Hope Rescue Mission that kept you from coming back home? Well, you see, all the bad choices took me to a dark place and I wasn't happy. I was living only for myself and felt like I was wasting away. But I was finally able to get what I needed. I was able to find my peace and joy in life. He got sucked into the dad syndrome instead of focusing on himself and getting into the alcohol and women. Sorry ma. I will say that, they took me in, they fed me, they taught me how to cook and clean, and they got me back on track. Cheo, I'm happy you're home. I'm glad you found something that works for you. Bro, the white man brain washed you. They love volunteers. Or you can call it some slave labor. You're just a sucka. Vinnie, shut up. Hey George, remember when they used to say that Jesus died for our sins? Yeah, I remember that. Well I never understood what that meant until now. So are you clean now, Cheo? Five years, one month, 17 days, to be exact. I'm so proud of you, Cheo. Thank you. By the way, any of you guys seen Eli lately? I haven't seen him for years. I heard that he moved. Maybe you can go down and talk to Teresa and she might tell you where he's at. Yeah. Meanwhile, mama's gonna fix my chacito his favorite dinner so we can celebrate. Vamos! Hello Ms. Cole? It's Cheo. Cheo Colorado. Cheo Colorado, wow. I haven't heard that name in such a long time, come in. How have you been doing? Good. Goodness, come on in. Don't mind the mess around here. Don't worry about it, Ms. Cole. Come on in, let me get you something in the kitchen. So how have you been? Oh I'm fine honey, I'm just, I'm just enjoying my glass of chardonnay, waiting for Eli to come visit me. I'm sorry, is this a bad time? No, silly, it's fine. You know, I'm just waiting on Eli, he's gonna bring me by some money. Have you talked to him? To be honest, I just released myself from a men's home, cleaned myself up. I had a rough patch and needed some spiritual guidance. Well you look good. You know, it's nice to see a familiar face around here. I can remember when you and Eli were playing music in your living room and you kept all of Peoria street up. Yeah, those were the good times. You know, life can be so severe, you know, how things can change over time and you know, it can be really hard. You're telling me. It's been awhile and I never expected I would be out on my own for so long. But I guess that's what the Lord had in store for me. When Eli got big, it got really hectic around here. Between the money, fans, fame, you know, it got really crazy but we really needed the money. Eli got big? You didn't hear? He got a record deal. And they gave him a big signing bonus about five years ago. Really? I did not know that. How's it going, man? It's good to see you, brother. How you been? I'm doing much better lately. After everything with Blue, I just needed some space to find myself and whatnot. I wasn't expecting you to be here, man. It's definitely a surprise, I can tell you that much. And Blue, man I miss her. Yeah, I miss her too. But I was in the neighborhood visiting my mom and I kinda wanted to visit you and your mom. You know, catch up. I'm definitely glad you're doing great, man. Hey, you look good. Hey mom, how you doing? Hey, how you doing? I'm just fixing some drinks for everyone, Cheo, would you like something? I'm okay, Ms. Cole, thank you. Hey mom, before I forget, here's a check. Thank you so much. So, I heard you made it big. Yeah, something like that man. You know, I just get focused and somehow somewhat. So I got noticed along the way, that's all. That's good, I'm happy for you. Thanks man. Hey so how long has it been? About five years. Has it been that long? My god. What's been going on with you lately? Well I'm about to get in the studio with Deville Records you know, I'm about to do my 3rd album. 2nd one wasn't too great, you know, I gotta keep going at it to keep my mom and I going, you know? Hey I actually just got back the UK from a tour. Nice, me and mom were actually just talking about how time flies. Isn't it crazy? Right man, one day we're chilling in your room, cranking up that music mix, you know it. Well everything happens for a reason, Eli. Just keep in mine, the Lord is truly what matters in life, Blue's here one day and the next, she's with God. So what happened between us, man? We used to be so tight. The Lord just had a different path for us, I guess. You keep saying the Lord, as in like, Jesus Christ? Yeah man. So what's up, is that what you've been learning about these five years cause you've got some type of peace about you now. I found Christ, I'm a new man. Well I'm all messed up man, I've gotta get my act together, so much is going on right now. Anything you wanna talk about? Oh just label pressure, and this whole money thing, I guess. Your mom said you had a signing bonus. Something like that, man. But you know what, there's so many damn expenses. And you know, I'm starting to have my mom slip away with this drinking thing. You know what, think about getting a call from the cops at 2am telling you that your mom is drunk and out of control at the Connection Bar. You know, I'm dealing with those type of distractions. That's rough. Yeah man. I'll keep you in prayer. But you do solo work or group stuff? I'm doing solo with some temp musicians in the studio, if it's not one thing, it's the other. Why don't we pray? You know that's not my thing man, you should know that. Just remember, it's all because of Jesus that you're where you're at. The gratitude is there bro, but you know what, I'm just so damn tired man, I'm tired. I wanna just go back to 18 or something, yeah. Hey Eli, let's play Cheo one of your singles. You know, he could use a good tune after being out of society for years. Mom, mom, not right now. We're going to grab something to eat, all right? I don't mind, let's hear your stuff. Don't be stingy Eli, this is close to my heart now. Now this tune, this is the one that Deville Records was really interested in. And it rocketed my son to stardom and made him famous and now we're rich. Sounds familiar. You got signed by Deville Records? Yeah man. Sounds a little familiar, that's for sure. Turn it up, that's the keyboard. Nah man, we don't gotta listen to this man, it's outdated and it's old if you ask me. So come on, let's get those burgers, yeah? I'm not really that hungry. I just realized the time, I gotta get going. I promised my mom I'd say bye to her before she goes to work. Are you sure, come on, it'll be my treat, come on. Yeah man, I didn't mean to intrude. Do you mind saying bye to your mom for me? Nah man, just stay, chill with my mom, you can do the whole prayer stuff too if you want to. It was educational to say the least. But good luck with the career, take care my brother. Ay yo, Cheo. Take care of yourself, man. Mr. Cole, it's so wonderful to see you, how have you been? Good, and yourself? Oh very good, you here to see Mr. West? Yeah, can you call him up? Yes I will. You're already in the conference room? All right, I'll bring him right in, thank you. Eli, good to see you, come on in. Did it really take us 12 voice messages to get you down here? Have a seat. I'm glad you got back to me when you did. We, the label, have a few things we wanna clear up and discuss with you. So again, thanks for coming in. Wait, wait, hold up, hold up, hold up, what things? Well, you got my messages, right? About the legal issues and the hold up on some of the tracks on the new album? So now they're saying I stole it? No, no, there's just some samples that our people felt might be better if we had certain channels getting the rights to. Unfortunately these channels take a little more time than usual. Look Eli, you're becoming a major artist here. We just wanna make sure that you're covered and your work is totally untouchable. All right so what's up, is that it? No Eli, these legal checks are just a minor bump on our end. To be honest, we'd like you to submit more work so that our people can arrange it and make a final product. So you want more? Yeah, we're going to need more. A lot more Eli. That's what we do here. We pay you, you produce for us. It's not hard, is it? At least it should not be. It'd be best if you just give us as much finished product as possible so that you and the record can get moving on the next album which is due by the end of the quarter. You guys are serious? The next quarter, no freakin' way, man. What's the problem? The problem is I'm gonna give you guys everything so you guys can have some two bit editor hack my music. What about we terminate your contract right here, right now and stop your payroll immediately? How does that sound? The time, the money invested in you, everything is going to waste. Oh really? Yes, there is no way you are going to meet this tight of deadline. Especially since we are seeing both the quantity and quality of your work already. You don't work with us, we do not work with you. Simple as that. No more dodging our calls. Or I will request, as per your contract, this is a business, little man, if you do not wish to pick up the phone, someone else will... What the hell man? The sweat and tears that I put into this? So not only are you guys saying that my stuff is late, you're saying that my stuff is not good, this is my art, man. And I've made you guys some damn good dough if I say so myself. You know what? My new stuff, yeah my new stuff's gonna be dope. It's gonna be? It has been watered down. Your work really speaks for itself. I am not going to allow this contract to be taken advantage of. I'm not going to wait any longer. Deal with nor should I put any of your shortcomings. You give me one good reason, just one, why I should not terminate the contract right now. Eli, we just wanna get to the bottom of this. Please sit, please. We also have here, a copy of your contract. Just in case you need to review your responsibilities. Good doing business with you. I knew you would see it my way. I'm sorry for everything, can you forgive me? What if I need you? Are you using me? You don't love me, you don't love me. Anybody, anybody? Everything to you is about Cheo, what about me, huh? What about me? You helped Cheo, can you help me back, please, Jesus, give me a rope, forgive me, I'm sorry, I need you to help me. Eli! He's gone, he's gone! Eli, Eli stay with me, help! Father God, you say when we're at our weakest, you're at your strongest. Lord you also say that you will never leave us nor forsake us. Please Lord, please. I pray that you put a hedge of angels protecting and surrounding Eli. And that the enemy be bound and cast it back to where it belongs. In Jesus's holy and powerful name, I pray, amen. Welcome back, Eli. How are you feeling? Can you talk? You know, you almost drowned? Can you hear me? Can I listen to your heart and lungs? Can you take some deep breaths for me? Can you tell me what happened to you? No. Think I fell down. Well you must have an angel watching over you because you survived. I can see that you're feeling well. I'm gonna check on you tomorrow and try to get you home soon, okay. In the meanwhile, you will get a visit from one of our mental health physicians. All right, feel better. Hey Cheo. Eli, I'm glad you're alive and awake. He heard our prayer. How you feeling? I'm feeling good, man. I got the music you left me. I'm sorry man, I didn't mean to burn you like that. Don't worry about it. Life always tries to take us out sometimes. The music's yours, bro. Still got that glow about you, man. And that peace. I want that man, I want that. It's because I found the Lord at my lowest point of life. He had a different path in life for me than what I had. But he helped me get through the loss of Blue. So is this Jesus thing for real? It's as real as it comes. And look, he saved you, and here we are. Hey, get some rest brother. Hey Cheo. Man, I know I already told you this but I'm sorry man, I'm sorry for stealing your music. I knew we were gonna talk about this one day. But I didn't know I was gonna ask you, can you forgive me, man? Eli, you mean much more to me than any music or fame. God has given me peace and joy. And he's forgiven me for all my shortcomings. How can I not forgive you? I just wish I was a better friend to you, man. How about we leave the past in the past and we start thinking about our future? I think it's time we start making music. And I'm talking your music. You up for it? What did you have in mind? That was clean, bro. So I think when the chorus comes around the second time, that's when we can have the mini bass solo. Exactly right, but after the solo, let's go straight back into the slow jam and into the outro because when we pull those notes out, it'll sound dope. A little more keyboard work here and there and it'll be so strong, you can feel the power from the song. Ain't gon' lie man, I have a good feeling about this one. Amen. Hey Jim, pick up the bass. Maybe a little midi here. Nice. No break. Eli and Cheo, back at it again with East Side Daly City. Top of the hill. When it all comes down to it, the one thing from my journey I can say that stood out, was this. Life happens in the blink of an eye. You asked me what I've learned, so I'll tell you. I learned the source of forgiveness. The source of love and the source of peace. In the end, it wasn't about my passion for music. Or my issues with Eli. No, it was something a little deeper inside. Something you can't see. I know now more than I did then. You have to be able to fill your heart with God's love because love can't be measured. Love is the most important and powerful word there is. Jesus is love, God is love. And the Holy Spirit is love. And always remember who the source of love is. ♪ I'm a mission ♪ I've got a mission ♪ I'm on a mission ♪ I'm ready to go ♪ I'm on a mission ♪ I've got a mission ♪ I'm on a mission ♪ Don't ever leave me alone ♪ I knew my life was full of sin ♪ ♪ God was talkin' but I wasn't listenin' ♪ ♪ Then the flame sparked my heart ♪ ♪ Ignited the love in me ♪ You touched my heart and my soul ♪ ♪ Don't ever leave me alone ♪ Don't ever, don't ever leave me alone ♪ Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
