Back in five, we are streaming live from Bubble HQ. It's launch day at Bubble. What incredible tech are they about to unveil? We're going in. Have you ever felt completely alone? Standing on the edge of things, so awkward, not daring to approach anyone? What if you could have one perfect friend who thinks you're awesome, who can help you find friends and make it all easy? All staff to the launchitorium. Marc, they're ready. Marc? So, this is it. This is finally it! The day that we at Bubble give the whole world a new best friend! Marc! Marc! Marc! Aw! We did this together, guys! This is what it's all been for. Right back to the time in the garage where Bubble started. My garage, folks. My garage. Of course, yes, Andrew. Thanks. Uh... But today, we take a huge leap from Bubble's phones and tablets and watches to a whole new world of connection. And at its heart, my code. My algorithm for friendship.

Love you, guys. - Create Sav's group chat. - Check for Science Squad. Okay. Okay. 18 minutes of recess hell. You have got this! Maybe not. - Barney! - Oh, no. All alone again? No, I'm good. I just... - On your birthday? - No, no, no... You have to be kidding me. Who told her? Your grandma called the school. I just need to go... I forgot my, uh, inhaler. The other one. - Got it. You need to sit down. - Huh? This is gonna work, Barney. You'll see. - It really won't. - Yes, it will. It kind of makes things a lot worse. - Wow. - Brutal, man. Come on. Bring it in, brave soldier. Whoa... What? - Oh, ho ho! - Bring it in, Barney. Come on, Barney boy. Bring it in. Wow. How low can a kid go? Now, when someone comes along, talk to them about a hobby. Didn't you write me an essay on rock collecting? Yeah. No. Will you go talk to Barney? He loves rocks. He needs friends. It's his birthday. Kill me now. Happy birthday! Ha-ha. Miss Thomas said you wanna talk about rocks? Who likes rocks? So, you're into rocks? That's nice. Uh... Seriously? Dude, it's your birthday and you still didn't get a B-Bot? Maybe he doesn't want a B-Bot. Maybe he prefers rocks. Hey. You're a rock star, Barney. - Oh, snap. - Ha-ha! You get it? Who's your favorite movie star? The Rock? - Killer, Rich. - Ha-ha-ha! You rock, man! Just gets funnier and funnier. - Oh, hey, Barney. - Can we rock up at your house? That's funny, Rich. Check out your awesome rock collection? No, Rich. I'm afraid you can't come to my house. For some reason. Come on! Get off! Hey! It's my birthday, you dumb goat. Sorry, are we on the line? Is that... Yes, hello! So, today, Mr. Takahashi, Pudowski Novelty Exports International are very excited to offer you this highly amusing novelty, the Brother Bouncy car monk. He wiggles, he bounces, - he's got... - Uh... No. - He'll hold your phone. - Uh... Oh, hi, Barney. Good day? Uh... Mr. Takahashi? Are you there? Hello? Mom, did you unplug my router again? I had Tokyo! I need this contract. Sure. It was fine. Barney! Mr. Takahashi? Hello? ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Come. Eyes shut.

Always. Used to. - Thanks, Dad. - And Gran. I just... The goats' wool and my allergies. Oh, no, no, no. No one in Pudowski family have allergy. What about Uncle Boris? He was possessed. By a demon in a cashew. I don't know, Mom. What time your friends come, Barney? - I cook all day. - Wow! This real food. Yum! Schkembe! Bet your friends never had tripe soup before. Ooh! I put on Zany Bogomil! Like last time we had party, remember? When you were six. All right. Um, actually, the thing is... No one's coming to the party. No one? Huh? You ask and all say no? Son, we're a little worried about you. You... You never go out with anyone or have friends over. You know, that's why we thought invite the whole class! Get the whole gang over here, right? You know. Get you in the swing of things with everybody. I make food for all your buddies. I don't really have... You know, they probably just didn't read the invites. No one does paper these days. They send messages with their B-Bots. Really? You need a B-Bot to have a social life these days? - Eh, pfft! - Yeah, Dad, kind of. No. I don't want you addicted to some device. You should be out there in the woods. Kicking around with a buddy. Get out there, Barn. Interact. You don't wanna spend your whole life glued to a... - B-Bots. - What? It just a craze - and they cost a fortune. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. It's... it's a waste of money. No big deal. Bubble delivery. What? It can't be! Dad, you were kidding me! I knew you wouldn't just give me rock hammers. I knew it! Oh. A rock. ♪ We will, we will rock you ♪ Yo, I got the whole thing, bro. It was hilarious, Barn. You thought it was a B-Bot. A B-Bot? Let it go, Rich. You get out of here. You want I pour hot chicken fat down your pants! Barney, what's going on? It's okay, Dad. Really. These are great. I hope they're not closed. B-Bot, B-Bot. Get him something useful like a snow shovel. Or a cordless drill. It's what he really wanted. If his mom were alive, she'd have known that. - Mom, people! - Ooh! - People! - Crazy lady! Whoa! Whoo! It's okay. It's fine. Whoa, whoa! Perfect! Wait. Wait, wait, wait. - Argh! No, no, no. - No! No, wait. - Hi! Please... - Lady! ...hold on just a second. Uh, it's my son's birthday. I need a B-Bot. Maybe just the basic model? No, no, no. Hang on, please. Please, please. I throw in goat. Goat for a B-Bot. She real friend. And when you get bored of this one, krrr, you can eat her! - Less waste, good for planet. - Yeah. What? No. No, no, no. Come on. Three month wait? What is this? Stalinist Russia? I am not afraid of you, Bubble booble! What do you got for me, pal? We got five pads and some phones. Yeah? What about that one? Uh, that one fell out of my van earlier. Happy late birthday, Barney. Wha... Dad! Oh, Dad! You got me one! - A real one this time! - Yeah, I can see! Thank you, thank you, thank you so much! And Gran. - Mwah, mwah. - Oh, you good boy!

No! A friend does not go through your stuff or burn it or melt it or dismember Mr. Bunky. Removing Mr. Bunky's head required a breaking point of 7.6 newton. Stop! What is wrong with you? Gran! Gran is 78. A former anti-communist with an approximate weight mass of 360... Whoa-ho-ho! No, no. Cheeky. The B-Bot. There's something wrong with it, Gran. It look all right to me.

Did you obtain this bot illegally? What? This took a turn, and we gotta get out of here. Send it to the crusher! - What? - For all we know, it could kill someone. No. It's mine. It was my birthday present. We'll return it to the facility, run some tests. Do you want me to close the whole store? No, no, no. Uh, one crushing coming up! Use the recycler. Adios, Absalom. Arrivederci. Auf Wiedersehen. No, you can't do that. Dad, please. It was sticking up for me. Barney, we gotta let it go. Let's take some details. - What was your name, sir? - Uh... Absalom, will crushing be fun? Phew. - Hi, Absalom. - Shh. - Happy birthday! - What are you doing? A friend must stay within six feet. We'll go to the crusher together. No! Crushing is not fun! It means smushed, flattened... Uh... Uh... A... A... A... Think, think, think. Annihilated. - Annihilated. Not fun! - Shh. We gotta get out of here. Where are you...? Ow. Hey, stop! Hey!

But you get to choose your friends. And you don't choose me. I do, okay. I choose you. I can fix you, like Gran said, and I'll teach you how to be my friend. Okay, Absalom. Okay. My registered name is Absalom, but my friends call me Barney. My friends call me... Ron Bintscatsco. Okay, Ron. Okay, Barney. One day parking ticket, next day firing squad. No, that's not gonna be a problem. Hey, Barn. I am so sorry about the B-Bot. I'll figure something out. It's okay, Dad. Not a problem. I... I think it's gonna be fine. 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99! One hundred million units sold! Whoo! Yeah! Well, we made 100 million new friends, all helping kids connect, meet each other, - interact. - And all through their B-Bots. Making friends face-to-face? So last three millennia. That's not what... Some kids check in with their bots a hundred times a day, plus 11 times overnight. We've finally done it. We've ended sleep. Uh, the algorithm may need adjusting. Think of the data we can harvest! No, no, no. I designed them... - In my garage. - ...for making friends. Into dollars. If our share price goes any higher, we'll have to give it a space suit. So what about the B-Bot that punched a child? It hit a cop? And a child. It hit a cop. We can't put that on the box. No, no. B-Bots are incapable of violence. My algorithm totally ensures no... - Ow! Ow! - Ow! Ow! - I better look into that. - You think? I mean, what if someone gets injured? I, for one, could not live with what that would do to our share price. It's not a problem. We performed a complimentary in-store crushing. Good! Uh... Because if that was still out there, we'd be toast. Uh... Shh. Guys, no clucking. Okay, Ron. How to be my friend. A bunch of your code is missing, right? The settings have not been uploaded. So, I'm gonna teach you to be my friend. And then you can come to school. What is a friend, Barney? Well, a friend is a person who, uh, likes, uh... Is always... I... A person who, uh, "likes, is always, I." Okay. Now I'm your best friend. Hey. Come back. No, no, no. There's a lot more than that, Ron. You have to know everything about me. You have to like me, obviously. Like all the same stuff as me, and you have to be on my side. But don't hit people. Even Rich Belcher. Hair, brown. Height, 4'11". 5'11" would be better. You could reach high objects. Hey. A friend likes everything about you. - What? - Let's go to school. You don't even know where school is. Alice Springs, Allahabad, Anchorage, Albuquerque. Ooh. A-ha! Mom! You're shorting the power out! You gotta fit in. Huh? Likes. Rocks, chess, Pac-Man. - Bill the Bus. - No! That was when I was, like, two. Toast. But only for breakfast. Butter on its own. Mm! Dislikes. Possums, musicals, school. Generally. The BuddyBench. Eugh! Worms. I don't trust anything without a face. Stop! I am fitting in! You must always stay within six feet. I will always stay within six feet. Unless I say not to. I am not to stay within six feet. No, no. Sometimes, yes. - Sometimes. - And sometimes, no. - Yes. - Like, if I had a bad day - or... - Bad day. Always six feet. Allergies. Goats, wool. Goats' wool. I'm basically allergic to life. That's why I like rocks. That is sad and also tragic. What are you into, huh? Electricity? Electricity is better than rocks. Ron, what are you... Whoo-hoo-hoo! You got it! You got the six feet! Hey! No, no, no. That's... Barney? I got a little break. You wanna do something? Chess, maybe? Uh, thanks, Dad. I'm good. Okay. - Rocks. - Electricity. Rocks are better. - Electricity. - Uh, I said rocks. I prefer electricity. - Rocks. - Electricity. List friends. Uh, next question. You know, I'm... I'm not actually unpopular, you know. That would mean they know I exist. - Perhaps you don't. - Hey! List relations. Dad, Donka, some Bulgarian uncles. Donka says, actually, one was possessed, but I think it might have been a nut allergy. There was Mom, too, of course. But, uh, she died when I was two. And Dad moved us out here. It doesn't make me sad exactly 'cause I... I can't remember. But it did make things hard for Dad. She was returned to the facility? I guess. No receipt. Scratches neck 14.5 times a day. - What are you doing? - I am learning about my friend. Oh, cool. Please slap my hand to show we are bonding. Oh! Okay. You went to sleep! No. It was a move. Am I now your best friend out of the box? You're not still after that sticker. Oh, no, Ron. I'm so sorry. Hold on. Hold on. - Connect. Connect. - No! Stop! - Oh, no! Not that one! Ron! - Connect. Connect. Connect. That's Savannah's house! Okay, key light, Malibu filter. - Perfect. - Boom! Oh, hey, guys. You just caught me chilling. Afloat. Aquatic. Accident. What is that? It sounds like a giant snake. Or an evil clown! They live in the woods, and their heads go all the way around! - Evil clown! Evil clown! - Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just really wheezy, guys. I've been running. Ron! Barney Pudowski? You've ruined my aesthetic. - Sorry, Savannah. - Nice pool. Wait. Since when did you even have a B-Bot? And... Whoa. Look at him. I'm sorry. We're going right now. I just... Uh... Barney, your B-Bot is, like, super weird. - Yeah. - And naked? Ew! And hold on a sec. Why hasn't it friended me? No. He can't do any of that stuff. He can't make friends or... He's useless at all that. - Can't make friends? - What? Barney, don't say your weirdness has rubbed off on him. Making friends is, like, what he's for. If he can't do that, he's, like, literally pointless. Like, a lump of plastic just following you around. Hashtag landfill. - I am for making friends? - Ron... How do I make friends for Barney? Come. - Seriously? - Ugh. You share stuff about him. Like pictures of his food or his wake-up routine. You search for people who know him or like the same stuff as him. You show them pictures, and then you get comments, and then you get people that like him, and then you get friend invites. - Boom! Now he has friends. - Duh! Ron! We have to go! Does Barney need friends? Well, yeah! Or, fun fact, he will not survive middle school. Savannah, please don't tell anyone. I'm not supposed to have him. He has to be a secret. She's rewiring los electricos. Okay. Unicorn poo. It's great. You like it! Well, shipping date, um... Ow! It shocked me! Mind if I leave it on? I am literally pointless. What? I cannot make friends for you. Yeah. Well... I'm not so great at that either. You should see me during recess. Oh, it sucks. I stand there every day, on my own, on the edge of the yard, just hoping for a few people to share a bench with. You know? But why would they? The last time any of them came to my house, we set fire to them. Ow! Not again. I guess I'll just sleep with it off. Good night, Ron. They're psychos! It is them! I'd recognize those ears from space. Okay. Location. GPS. Uh... Get up the grid. Where is it? Uh, it's not actually on the network. That's impossible. So, I don't believe you. We track every B-Bot. - Um, yeah, but... - Then the kid. I want everything. Contacts, shopping habits, shoe-size. You mean his private data? Sure. Why else do we collect it? We've got nothing on him. He hasn't friended anyone. He doesn't blog, post, or share. Creepy. Her whole life is online. Andrew. Is it true? It's still out there? The store made an error. They squished Sally Squirrel. ♪ Let's learn where we... ♪ That's awesome! What the heck are you talking about? I looked into it. And... See? This is it! It's what I imagined when I was his age. They're having fun! Fun? How... How can you have fun offline? It's against nature. Andrew, I never programmed B-Bots to laugh. I have to understand this. Can we get a hold of it? Ho-ho, we will. My aerial? No power in whole street? No. No idea. What? Ron, no! You have to hide. You're not ready. I'm sorry. I'll be back soon. There are no friends in the shed. Hi! I am Barney's B-Bot. I live in the shed. I am for making friends. Idiot! I am sharing Barney's breakfast. Do you like it? How about you? Would you like to comment on this picture, old woman? Barney likes rocks, asthma inhalers, and his grandmother's food. Will you come to my secret shed and like him? No. No, no. No. Barney likes rock hammers, too! I'm gonna be late. My pants are on backwards. That was Barney's wake-up routine! - Okay. - Friend request. Friend request. So a prime number is a natural number greater than one that cannot be divided by any number. I know you're keen, but it's not quite recess yet, Barney. Oh, my asthma. I need my inhaler, ma'am. Uh, I'll be one minute. Ron! What are you doing here? There are no friends in the shed. I am for making friends. No! No, no, no. You have to go before they come out for... Recess. You have two new messages. Only two? Hey, Barn. You got a B-Bot? - Um... - Hey. Awesome. Huh. Well, that went well. I thought so. Okay. Come on. Wow, that's so minimalistic. It's like a blank canvas. Friend request. Recess. Maybe it'll be okay. Recess will not suck. You will have friends to sit with on a bench. I don't know. Yeah. I guess. You will. - I have brought you some. - What? I am literally not landfill. This is so crazy. Ron! Wait! You have five new friends. I did a search for them. Shayne likes low-priced alcohol and conspiracy theories. He believes there's a secret lizard government - beneath Switzerland. - Shh. He will friend you if he can stay in the shed. Barney! Bro! Just for a year. Two max. Are those your friends, Barney? Is this, like, a rave? This friend shared your breakfast and liked it. Oh, yeah! He gets hungry like you. Your neighbor Mrs. Baxter's parrot has one friend in common with you. Your neighbor, Mrs. Baxter. He commented on your photo. He has done other things on your photo, too. Margaret will friend you - and share her... - No. ...purse, watch, anything if I please, please just let her go. Now you have friends to sit with on a bench at recess. I'm so sorry. You can't be here. Barney, meet friend number five. This tiny bald man likes your picture so much, he is eating it. There he is! Logan! Friend request, friend request. - Ron? - Ron, Ron, Ron. - Yeah! Come on! - Ron, Ron, Ron! Savannah Meads' mom didn't recognize the boy. We're at her school now. Okay, sure. We keep this low-key, people. Discreet. Nice and quiet, okay? - Love you guys! - Ron, Ron, Ron. Pudowski! Yeah! Sticking it to the man! Principal's office. Now! Hey, bros. Ho-ho-ho-ho. Come on, Pudowski. Move it! You're not new, are you? You're that crazy broken dude who punched me. How'd you do that? I have no mega safety controls and stuff. Safety settings, parental controls, account limits, all off! That's how come he hit you, dude! I want mine like that. Then it can hit me, too! I could get R-rated movies. Copy him. Find that code. Unlock. Unlock. He's gonna get us a trillion views! I don't like you. I don't like you. Hey, guys. Savannah. What's going on? It's Bubble! My post is such a hit, the whole company's following me. What post? Twenty thousand friends love... What? I said he has to be a secret. I know. But it went crazy! You're such an actual freak, Barney, it's, like, almost cool. Pudowski! Pudowski! What is going on? Nothing, Ms. Hartley. You brought in a baby? Artificially sweetened beverages? - A parrot. - A parrot. Where is the bot? Call head office. Get him, boys. Unlock, unlock, unlock. Get 'em! - Unlock. - Uh... Okay. Buy 10,000 mechbucks. Whoa! It works! BubblePay has no limits! Give me weapons. Give me upgrades. All upgrades unlocked. Hey! Jerk of Thrones. - What? - Get them! Hey! Those are our bots! - Give them back! - Whoa! Levelling up! - Whoa! - My prank, Noah. Thanks for the ride. Oh! Rich, come back! Yo, Sav. Who's lame now? - Hey! - Unlock. Do you wanna connect to all the users of the Bubble network? You can access them all? Um, yeah! Okay, hi, um, everyone in the world. And this is Nonsuch Middle School. Incoming! It's Mad Max meets Sesame Street live streaming. We think the safety controls are off on all the bots. Uh, let's send out a patch. Yeah, we're on it! That was awesome! What the...? You shall not pass. Kiss my Sith Lord butt! Rabbits, attack! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Book a party at a night club. Invite everyone. Except Savannah. Everybody, stop! Hey, Rich! - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Catch! Whoo! You got this on the live, bro? For the views! So it's basically kind of the apocalypse, but fun! Hey, cut it out, Sav. This is my thing. Sorry, Rich. I have... Four million, four hundred and thirty-two views. Oh, Australia's waking up. G'day, guys. We're about to be shamed by a whole other hemisphere. And this is a giant monkey... zombie mash-up that's basically trashing our school. - Patch in one minute. - Are you knitting this thing? - Do something! - Hello? It's nearly pickup! Brains! Ha-ha! And I'm Rich Belcher from Prank You Very Much. Get this. Hey, hey. Snack! It pooped me. Sharing "It pooped me." - Sharing "It pooped me." - Sharing. - No. Stop it. - Sharing. Sharing. Sharing. - Don't share that. - Sharing "It pooped me." Uploading the patch now! That's the patch. Just in time. Good thing nobody saw it. You just killed Bubble, Marc. Spread out. Find the rogue. How can I put this gently? Get out! Hi, Barney. We have 43 new friends. Maybe you do. But I've been kicked out. This way. Ugh! How could you? You dumb bot! I'm in so much trouble now. All you had to do was just fit in. What was the point of even...? Barney, are you my friend? What? What do you mean? My dad bought you for me. What's that? Where are you going? Friendship is a two-way street. - What? - I get to choose. You taught me. I didn't say be more than six feet. But you are having a bad day. You know what? I don't care. Fine! Go on then. - I am going. - Uh-huh. - Okay. - Okay. I'll... - Okay. - Okay! Adios, registered-name-Absalom. Adios, Absalom's B-Bot. It's trending in 13 countries! They've searched the school, Marc. They didn't find it. Bubble shares are crashing. Down 43%. We've got thousands of parents complaining about B-Bot safety. We've got thousands of kids complaining their bots won't do the same stuff! Marc, what do we do? I... Uh, I've... I wonder. Maybe being a guy who makes his friends out of skateboards doesn't equip you to run a global tech giant. Mm! Okay. Here's our story. We blame everything on the rogue. A single unit with a minor coding error. Minor? But the riot. What riot? We hose down the Internet. Delete every video. Take down every post. Any TV station broadcasts it, we buy the station and replace it with cat videos, then we sue the kids for misuse of product unless they sign a binding yada, yada, and send the principal a fruit basket. But what does the genius think? Okay. Andrew, you do this. Sweet justice pie. Hey, run off back to your lab and invent something that doesn't kill us all. And, uh, you got an algorithm for refilling this? We got an address from the school. Pudowski. Oak Hill Drive. Bing bong belushi! Go! Huh? No. But Barney doesn't even have a B-Bot. All the kids at school confirm he does, Mr. Pudowski. He started a riot. I'm sorry, are you calling my son a liar? Oh, Barney. Barney, are you my friend? "Know everything about me." "Stay within six feet of me." "Like me." Huh? Ron! What are you doing? Returning myself to the facility. I am a dumb bot. No! No, you're not. I'm so sorry. I was wrong. We did not fix me. I did not fit in. Who cares? Neither do I. It doesn't matter. 'Cause you are my friend. Your best friend out of the box? But still don't burn my underpants. You know, I have been worried about him, but, uh, I just... I work these crazy hours. The bot's in there? Okay. This thing is dangerous. We need to destroy it. - Let's run. - Barney, are you in there? Just you and me. Mom, do you have a key? We don't need anyone else. Hey, you're not in trouble. Please, just let me in. Where is he? - Shh. - No clucking. Could he be with a friend? Well, he... he doesn't really have any. Hey! Isn't that the kid? Go! Go, go, go! He's getting away! We need to go faster! No problem! Ron, you did it! Yes! Hey, down here! Hey, stop! Come back! We just want the bot! Quick! Shh. "Poop Girl" is trending. You have 19,032,000 likes. - He went this way! - Shh. Hey, miss. You seen a boy and a bot? Do I look like I care? Okay, sorry. My bad. What's going on? Bubble are looking for Ron. They blame him for the riot. I have to protect him. Hey, dude. I think that was Poop Girl. Savannah? "Poop Girl" has 20 million and 56... Poop Girl. That's... That's who I'm gonna be for my whole life. No. You sure he's not back there? - We gotta go. - Wait. You're running away? To the woods? Please don't tell anyone this time. There are evil clowns in there, Barney. Their heads go all the way around. That's owls, Savannah. I promise! You lost them? No, no, no. This is not happening. You know what? Access the cameras on every B-Bot in town. Use B-Bots to spy? No. We're just recording for training and monitoring purposes. - But Marc would never... - Marc put a camera within six feet of every young consumer in the country. And now you're worried about privacy? Turn on the mics, too. Listen out for "Barney," "Rogue Bot," "Profit-sucking plastic psycho." That kind of thing. We'll find him. Wherever he is in that Podunk town! - Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! - Whoo-hoo. Whoo! Whoo. - Ron. - In your face. Come on, Space Lord, fight me! You need a stick. - Searching for stick. - Huh? Is this one good? Come back and let me hurt you. Ron! That's way too big for a stick! Look at mine compared to yours! Please help. You have 0.85 friends. - You have 0.7 friends. - Oh, wow, you're sinking. Hold on. Just... You have 0.2 friends. Grab my hands! I'm gonna get you out. I'm gonna get you out. You know what? You choose. Two-way street, right? That way is good. No, wait, wait. Where are you going? Ron. Hey, wait. Stop! Stop, stop. No! Ron! Gotcha! Whoa! Gotcha! What? Why on earth would you do that? Do I have to like the path you like? No! But your path sucks! And seriously? Off a cliff? I like, "Seriously? Off a cliff?" That way is good. Log. Log. - Log. - Here. Been eating too much electricity? - Your muscles are under-sized. - No, they're not. Hey, Ron. Tell me something about you. I never asked. I am a Bubble generation one B-Bot. I currently have one friend. - Oh, wow. I found it. - Nice! You wanna share? You have not shared 29 friend invites. Yeah. I know. If you don't ask, they can't say no. Problem solved. You know who I had at my party when I was six? Savannah and Rich. For real. They were my friends just because they lived nearby. But at some point you just... You just get it... that you're not gonna be one of the cool kids. Hey, who cares, right? 'Cause I currently have one friend, too. How long will we live in the woods? I don't know. Forever? Do you know any stories, Ron? I can create one from my available data. It will be called "The Awesome Adventures of Absalom of Addis Ababa "and His Android, Alan." Once upon a time in Addis Ababa, capital city of Ethiopia, sovereign state in the Horn of Africa, with 100 million inhabitants, lived Absalom and his friend Alan, a generation one android. That's a nice story. Shall we check your messages one more time? - Yeah, sure. - "Poop Girl" is trending. Savannah unfriended me? Unfriend her! Well, anyone with a brain cell should block Rich Belcher. Message to anyone with a brain cell. They what? It wasn't my fault. Shall we check your messages one more time? My algorithm. What? Did you see Savannah? Poop Girl, right? I'm so glad I am not her right now. You dropped her from this chat, right? Dropping Savannah from this chat. Someone did a remix. ♪ It pooped me ♪ ♪ It pooped me ♪ Who did that? Anonymouse3 created it. 23 million friends love "Poop Girl, the Remix!" Oh. Hi. Uh, we're Barney's... Um... He hasn't come home. And, yeah. So we're just... We're checking with his, uh... his fellow children. You are Barney's friend. You come to his birthday party. Um... My goat eat your slap bracelet. Oh! That party. Do you have any idea where he is? Uh... Um... No, I, uh... Sorry. Oh, Mom. I work round the clock selling novelty junk just to try to give him a life. But I'm blowing it, Mom. I... I've lost touch with him. Why didn't he come to me? Sometimes kid protect grown-up. That's not right. He will be okay. Pudowskis are brave and strong. There's a spider. Literally, like, this big! A bird has commented on your face. Oh, great. Where even are we? Recess. Now known as 20 minutes of extra math. What is four-fifths as a decimal? What is the square root of nine? Ugh! Seriously?

Twelve hours? Twelve days? Twelve years? - Twelve decades? - Stop asking dumb questions. I have 12% battery power remaining. Ron, come back. Have you got water damage to the brain? I mean, seriously? If you go back, they will send you to the crusher. Do you want to be recycled as a lunch box? What is your plan? Is it, "Run! Run away! - "Go, go, go! We gotta run." - Stop. Ron. Stop it!

Five percent battery remaining. Five percent? Uh... Okay. Go to sleep. Power down. Power down. Oh, Ron. You're right about the dark. After my mom died, I was terrified every single night. And I wanted so bad to just run into my dad's room and tell him... but what if he was scared, too? Ron! Seriously, Ron? No one even knows we're here. He's in the woods. It's our fault he's out there. He left town for the woods? It's night. The weather's getting worse. Pff. So access the security cameras. Uh... There aren't any. It's the woods. Insane. Okay. Let's put some in. Get me to Nonsuch. They're in the woods. I have to meet Ron and Barney. One of these trees must have a power outlet or something, right? Oh, this is not okay, Ron. Best friends don't die on each other. Are we going around in circles? Hey! Down here! Over here! Help us! Help! Wait. They'll help me, but... No, no, no. Come on. What are they? Ow. I got nothing. We can't give up. People get lost in those woods and never come out. You know what? We've done our best. Let's call it a night. - What? We can't do that. - But what about the boy? He's just not in there. We should try across town tomorrow. Let's all go home. That's Savannah's B-Bot. And Noah's. Ron. I guess we're both literally landfill. "Poop Girl" has 32 million... Why is there mud on your wheels? Huh? No, no. You can't go back. Must survive middle school. No, no, Ron. They'll... They'll take you forever. They'll send you to the crusher. Stay with me. There are no friends in the woods. Ron.

How sad. - And yet how great for sales! - What? Okay. Moving on! We've known Barney since we were little. You were his best friend in kindergarten. And you were mine. It gets complicated. Yeah, right. Should I friend Barney? Searching for "Barney likes pranks." No matches. Your pranks are lame. They're funny, man. If I don't do funny, uh, I got nothing. Since when did this stuff matter? Barney and Ron. It's like we used to be. ♪ It pooped me ♪ - Barney? Barney! - Oh, Barney! Hey! Oh, Barney, I am so sorry. I let you down. I know I'm always overwhelmed with work. But I'm your dad, okay? You're like a piece of my heart walking around the world, and I love you so much that it makes me strong enough to deal with anything. Except losing touch with you. Just talk to me, Barney. - I'm trying! - You're lonely? I get it. - Where's Ron? - Just communicate. Ow! Hey! I've got a friend, Dad! The one that saved my life, remember? - Where is he? - Uh... Hi. I'm Marc Wydell from Bubble. Where is Ron? If you crushed him... No, of course not. Barney, I invented B-Bots. They're my dream. Connection and friendship. But it's not working. Except you and Ron. I fixed him. - I wanna understand. - What's up, Barney? Ron! You're okay! What's that? The new number one on the high-five charts. I now know all 100. - Are you okay? - Doing great, buddy! Let's go home and check out your awesome rock collection. No. You like electricity. I do if you do. Wait. This isn't Ron.

It's not him! N... No. It... It's okay. I backed up Ron to the cloud. I'll just log in and I'll find the old... Huh? They can't lock me out. I'm the CEO of Bubble. As the new CEO of Bubble, it's my sad duty to announce that the shareholders have wisely agreed to fire Marc Wydell. Andrew! Andrew! Andrew! - What? - Argh. Barney! He's in the cloud. That's what you said, right? - Well... - So take me there. - I'm sorry? - You heard my son. He needs to get to the cloud thing. And I'm going with him! Uh... Barney, the cloud is in a concrete fortress half a mile below Bubble. There are two million servers with a zettabyte of data. How would you find Ron? He's my friend. So take me there and get me in! Yeah! Go get - that psycho robot, dude! - Go! Go, Barney! Okay, Bubble booble. Let's go get Ron. Okay. To get Barney down into the cloud, we'll have to break in past security and get right to the heart of Bubble HQ. Tomorrow afternoon, all the workers will be watching Andrew in the launchitorium. That's our chance. All staff to the launchitorium. All staff to the launchitorium. Please welcome your new CEO, Andrew! Yes, yes, yes! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Ha-ha! Love it! - Hi. - Hi there! How can Bubble help you? - Cleaner! - Uh, ma'am, you can't just... - Sir? - Ma'am? Yeah. Can you take a look at this, please? It just keeps crashing on me. And there's a smell of burning when I hit the space bar. Sir, this isn't a Bubble Store. This is HQ. Oh. Uh... Oh! I just put Bubble in my GPS. I wondered why it was a 19-hour drive. Can you look at it anyway? Oh, silly me. Again, please. Oh! Ooh. Hang... Might be... Ooh. Pat down? So, workers, colleagues, shareholders. Hi, shareholders. Love ya. Bubble's had a few minor problems lately, right? Oof! Yeah. But here's the good news. There's nothing wrong with our B-Bots. It's kids. Kids are the problem. You give a child an hour of screen time, you get peace and quiet. You have his friends around, all hell breaks loose! Am I right, kids? Stick to your screens. Today, your best friend out of the box becomes... The only friend you'll ever need! Just log in, sir. Okay. Huh? See? That's what it did at my house. All good. What happened? Come on! Okay. Everybody out. This goats smells. Okay. This way. Server room. Fingerprint recognition. Uh... I fix it. Lights, sprinklers, air-con, security doors. Eat it all, Martina! What? Uh... What the...? - Okay. - You guys go that way. Good to see you, buddy. What is going on? Uh, there's a guy in reception. - What? - It's his laptop. "Pudowski Novelty Exports"? Pudowski! That kid! Uh, Andrew. He's in the building. What? Hey, yeah. I think he went down that way. Down here! Huh? They were right here. That is weird. Okay. Barney, slide along to the central shaft. The data cables inside lead to down to the cloud. We'll cover security and, uh, stuff. - Good luck, Momscke. - Okay. Okay. Of course they're in the corridors. They didn't just vanish! Just go down here. Whoa. Okay. He never mentioned that. What are you doing? Uh... Uh... Uh... I... You have problem with women in workplace? I never said that. You want to squeeze my knee? What?

I... They are not having fun. It's weird. I used to think that I was the lonely one. They need to upgrade to a Ron. I am for making friends. What? You mean, for real? Uh, upgrade them so they'd all be like you? Please connect me to the Bubble network. Two hundred and twenty-five million Rons out there! Please connect me. It would be insane! I mean, amazing, but... It will be fun. Huh. We're right here. In the middle of the network. Maybe we could really do this. It's our one chance. Now or never. - Systems are down. - It won't open! Uh... Come on, Barney. What are they doing? "Upgrade all B-Bots to be like Ron." Ron's code! Of course. His code is the fix to mine! I can help them. Marc? He's helping us.

You're all getting a Ron! Ron. Wait, where are you going? Into the network. No. No way. You just copy your code and send that. The settings have not been uploaded. No, no, no. His code is fragmenting. He'll disappear! No! We'll just have to go. Forget it. Come on. I'm not leaving you behind. Barney. I am for making friends. What? No. You're coming with me. How to be a friend. You taught me. No. Stay with me. Remember? Stay friends. We can fix it. You and me. Now or never. I guess we'll... we'll swap them all for a good one. The best one. Go, Ron. You don't have to stay within six feet. Go. Be everywhere. Adios, Absalom. Arrivederci, Ron Bintscatsco. - Come on. What is that? - What's happening? Whoo-hoo! Hi. Uh... I, uh, took a wrong turn. Oh. Uh... Right. This way, please. We got him. Finally. Job done. Uh, the cameras. Barney! Hey! There he is! Oh, Barney! Move it along. Everybody outta here. Did you...? I'm gonna tell you everything, Dad. On the way home. Okay. Great. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Etcetera. Sorry. Just, um... Uh... Where were we? A trick! Data harvesting units controlled by us.
