Do you want to hear my opinion? I can only give you details after the autopsy My first impression: The woman drowned. No traces of violence, only scratches. It's a mystery why the perpetrator pulled her out of the water. The man was stabbed with a sharp object. Difficult to say what it was, but it wasn't a knife. Perhaps I know more after the autopsy. So? The woman was drowned? That's for certain? I think so! Or do you want to explain my job to me? But why has he pulled her out again? What was going on in his mind? Perhaps his conscience. He even called us. - We found this in his pockets. - Thank you. What do you think? Powdered sugar or drugs? - Looks like LSD. - Yes, just what I wanted to hear. I expect your report as soon as possible. Moment, De Pol, I forgot... - ...The little girl had no underwear. - At least she won't catch a cold anymore. Commissario! Commissario! The coroner wants to see you. What is your impression, Maestrini? Do you think it's about drugs? Yes, obviously. I am bewildered by the killer's behaviour. Why does he drown the girl and pull her out of the water again? Have a little chat with the man there. He seems the nosy type. Perhaps he has seen something that can help us. Police. I want to ask you some questions. Good day. Come in. - Good morning. - My sister. She does not speak. This way. I have to sit down. - Sit down, too, if you want. - No thanks. You said you have questions for me? It's about the dead victims who were found by the canal. - Have you seen anything? - What a question! Nonsense! How could I have seen something? None of the windows faces this part of the canal. - See for yourself. - We saw you with binoculars at the window. Come clean. What do you mean? I will not have it! Do you think because you're a cop, you can treat me like that? Please, calm down! We don't accuse you of anything. So you have not seen anything that could help us? At night I am asleep. The crime happened in the evening. It was not dark. - I was watching TV at that time. - Of course! POLICE OF VENICE - Good morning! - Good Morning. Flavia and Fabio: DRUGS Commissario, I think it's time to quit. No luck with the old guy? Not really. He wasn't helpful. - Yes? - Did you read the newspaper? Good morning, Judge. How is your wife? Two drug related murders! On the first page! We are in the middle of the tourist season! I got a call from Rome! I want the killer caught, as soon as possible! Don't worry, we're at it. - We have some leads. - Good! Keep me informed. Of course. - The boss wants quick results! - As always! Maestrini, tell me something. - He's crazy! - The commissioner? No, no! The old man at the window. His apartment is a shit hole! He lives there with his retarded sister. He is paralyzed on one side and collects garbage! - Sounds bad! - You can say that. Yes? Ah! Doctor! What do you have for us? - Cocaine! - I told you so. One more thing: The woman had sex shortly before her death. But we do not know whether it was voluntary. Exactly. And we do not know with whom. Glad you are having a good time, we have a big problem here. If I can do something for you, just ask. - Thank you! Have a nice day. - Good luck! - Cocaine! - Let's inform the boss. One moment! Our dead girl... she had sex shortly before death. - Raped? - We do not know. - I'm out for Lunch. See you later, Commissario. - Maestrini! - Yes? - It's all about sex! That could be the key. - A sex offender? - No idea. Throw me an egg. - Yes, please? - You whore! Who is with you? - It's you. - I know that a man is with you. I have no time for this nonsense! Leave me alone. Who was that? - What did you say? - Who was on the phone? I do not understand. - It's not important. - Let me decide that. - Who was on the phone? - Nobody! A madman. Don't lie to me. Why are you so nervous? Me? Nervous? Why do you think that? You are mistaken. - Everything is fine. - Then why you play with your fingers? You talk already! Come on! Excuse me, Inspector! Tell me. - You tell me. - I can not believe that they had to die that way. So pointless! So atrocious. - Who's there? - Don't you dare hanging up! I have asked you a question, slut! I have told you to leave me alone! Stop playing games. Answer! Leave me alone, or I call the police. Who's there? Say, who's here! Hello? Damn! He hung up. What did he want? As I said, it's just a loony. He just won't leave me alone. He says he loves me more than anything. And that he wants to be with me. - The usual. - How long has this been going on? Perhaps a month or more. - You didn't want to go to the police? - No! I was hoping that he gives up. Bravo! This is the simplest solution. Please tell me something about the architect and his wife. Flavia and I were very good friends. We grew up together. We were good friends, like sisters. But we lost sight of each other. I went to university. She married. That's the way it is. Life changes. You meet other people. I rarely heard from her. He won't give up, no? We met a year ago in Venice again. We then saw each other more frequently again. Fabio, her husband, and l... we didn't get along at the beginning. But then things improved. We become friends and the three of us did lots of things together. The movies, dinner, theater... Picnic... and so on. Did you know that Fabio took drugs? Nonsense! That's impossible! Expensive drugs. - Cocaine! - This is not possible. You never noticed anything? No, never! Strange... when a friendship is so tight. How was it with Flavia? Did she say anything? Did she discuss her relationship with her husband? About certain sexual acts? - What does that have to do with anything? - I think you understand whee I am coming from. I do not know what you mean. Are you sure? Let's assume we did not only find pornographic pictures. But also special equipment? - Oh! - Marzia! I won't leave until you have told me everything. Okay. I'm telling you what I know. Fabio had unusual requests during sex. He told me that one day, on the way home. Come! Let's go in here. No, over there. Fabio! Good night. Promise me that we never do anything like this again. Why not? You didn't like it? It's not that. Don't you understand? You're always up for a quick number. What is the problem? That's not it! I felt shabby and ashamed. - What was that? - You don't want to understand! Sex needs new stimuli. Otherwise it gets boring. Learn to enjoy the moment. No matter when or where. Do you love me still? That has nothing to do with it, understand! No! Fabio! No! You bastard! No!!! Stop that! Hurry up! Here is Marzia, I've tried all day to reach you. - I need to talk to you, it's important. - What about? - Can we meet? - Fine with me. - When? - As quickly as possible. In the bar, as always. Don't make me wait. What happened? I'll tell you afterwards. See you soon. Ciao! Attention, she's about to leave the house. Let's get to work. See you later. - See you! - Have a nice day! I'm warning you, you whore. Don't you dare hang up again! Don't call the police. You're mine, understand? Do you understand? I won't let you out of my eyes all day! You can't fool me. The guy who's with you should keep his fingers away from you. I won't let you go. I love you and you love me. I know it. I can't stand another man touching you. We belong together. We are meant for each other. I won't let you stay with that bunch of perverts. I'd rather kill you! So? What's happening? The police came to see me. A brash Commissioner. - Asked many questions. - A young guy? Yes. Do you remember his name? - No. - Probably Commissario De Pol. - You know him? - Sure. He was after me for a while but couldn't prove a thing. Speaking about proof? Did you destroy the photos? No, should I? Idiot! You have to get rid of the stuff. - If you still have them, give them to me. - You're crazy. Well, I do what you say. Marco, you gotta help me. I'm afraid. Why? What is it? He's back and threatened me. He's obsessed. The student? Don't take him seriously. He's a loony. You do not know him. He is fanatic, capable of anything! Want a tip? Go on vacation! Get out of Venice, when you can. I don't want to be in your skin at the moment. You were right again. Sex is always the key. Always! Two of those we now know as corpses. And from the third we know the name. Marzia! Here we have the criminal Marco Dezan. What is missing is the name of this woman. At first glance, everything seems clear. I don't know, something smells funny. Something does not add up. Who could have be interested in killing this couple? The drugs are the only motive. Perhaps they wanted to deal with it and got bad company. Get to work! See if the archive can give us some answers. Perhaps we're lucky. Hello! Do you want to invite me for breakfast? In exchange I will tell you everything I know. Here's an egg! How did the autopsy go? No complaints, thank you for asking. You should go on stage with that act. Really funny! Come on! Can I hear your expertise? The wound looks as if the architect was stabbed with scissors. One that is used by tailors. Or something like that. At least we know something. Just arrest all tailors in town, then you'll have your killer. What's going on? Are you a photographer now? - God! Isn't that...? - Yes, they are. - And so lively! - Very funny. If only we knew why Flavia was drowned... and was then pulled out of the water. This is really strange. Here! Ciao! - Until next time! - Ciao! You scared me. Stop it! Why are you sneaking in this way? I waited. No reason to scare me like that. - Shall we go? - Good. 10,000 in advance. Come on! Just a quickie? Get undressed. Why the sunglasses? The bright light hurts my eyes. - Does it bother you? - What bothers me is that we still talk. I do prefer standing. Get up! The murderer has waited for her back there. We found traces everywhere. - This is the girl of the orgy. - Right. Now she has a name. This is getting weirder and weirder. Who kills someone because of an orgy? It is the only connection between the dead and the hooker. Where are they? Do what you're paid to do. - Calm down. - This case is driving rne nuts - Do you think this was the same man? - That's what I want to know from you. Give it some effort! You are the doctor, I'm only a cop. - May I? - Certainly. Hey, wait! - I'll bet she was killed with scissors. - You're disturbing me! No sense of humor. Anything to say? Is that supposed to embarrass me? Today that's not a big deal anymore. Does it bother you? I am bothered by people who want to take me for a fool. This time you won't get off the hook that easily. I am not a moralist, everyone can do what he wants. But your orgy is heavy to digest. Because two of your friends were killed. And the hooker died as well. Satisfied? There is enough evidence to connect you with these murders. With three murders...! You should start talking. It's the best for both of you! Then I'll see what I can do for you. Why should I have killed them? Because of the photos? That's nonsense! It's a bluff, you have nothing on me. - Watch your mouth. - Okay, okay! - Can I smoke here? - Go ahead. May I say something, Commissario? If you have to. On the day of the murder and the night after I was with Ines Amas. Check into that! Of course! - And this morning? - I was also with her. Let me clarify Commissario. On the day when Flavia and her husband were killed... I was not at home. I had the day off and was with my mother. I stay the night there. I am not surprised to hear that. It's true. Ask her. Give me a break! Of course, you knew nothing about any drugs, right? First time you hear about drugs. I bet you know where the stuff comes from. You just bluffing! You sold it to Fabio. You'd never pass on such an opportunity. You have no evidence, Inspector. Because I got out of such things a long time ago. Maestrini ?! Come here. Check the alibis of the two. - How does the ex fit into all this? - I don't know. I have to start somewhere, even if I am wrong. We have only the tape and the letter. And the big boss wants us to arrest him. Why not? It's logical. The anonymous letter with the threat of murder. He mentioned of a "perverse gang". The's what he says. But it doesn't mean that he killed three people. It is moral fanaticism which is overwhelmed by reality. Happens a lot in America. Let's talk about Fabio. I have to understand his psychology. This is the key to everything. I feel it! Alberto, I need your opinion as an expert. How does the coke and the neurotic fit together? And what's a plausible connection between perversion and drugs. I understand, what are you getting at. But what's the point trying to understand Fabio's sick personality? Will it help us catch his killer? What is the connection with his wife's murder and the death of the hooker? Please, answer me. Medically speaking, a drug addiction does not equal perverse fantasies. Or vice versa. A pervert always needs new stimulation. The cocaine can emphasis such stimulation but to most, it serves the same purpose as with all addicts. They want to compensate something that is missing. Filling the void. They are prisoners of their own dreams. They don't distinguish between dream and reality. They live almost in another dimension. What do you think? - Give that to me! - What should I think? I am running in circles. I also can't distinguish fantasy and reality anymore. No! Don't! No! Stop it! Let me go! I don't want that! I don't!!! No!!! I do not want that! If we classify sexual mania as pathological... and count in all the men who take it out on their wifes... we end up with an Italy full pathological cases. You really think so? What are you doing? (Unintelligible screams of terror and dialogue in the movie) - Let's move one further. - Why? - Go! - Okay. (On the screen: No... Let go of me !!!) (Unintelligible screams of terror and dialogue in the movie) (Unintelligible screams of terror and dialogue in the movie) (On the screen: No, please don't !!!) (On the screen: No! Son of a bitch!) (Unintelligible screams of terror and dialogue in the movie) (On the screen: Goodbye sweety!) (Unintelligible dialogue in the movie) (Unintelligible dialogue in the movie) (On the screen: Wait!) (On the screen: But you... you...!) (Unintelligible dialogue in the movie) (On the screen: Let me go!) Commissario, one moment. - There is a woman waiting for you. She knows something about the dead. In there. I'm Commissario De Pol. You wanted to see me? - My name is Flora Di Assisi. - Pleased to meet you. - Follow me. - You're so young. Please, take a seat. I recognized this young woman. She always visited the young man. Always went into the house. Excuse me? Do you have a light? - I don't smoke. - Not so fast! Neither do I. But we could talk about Flavia. Pretty. The important thing here are the scissors. Of course, this makes me a suspect. But here reality has exceeded the imagination. I'm an artist. This is something I won't miss. Whose signature is this? Bruno Nielson. You are German? My father was Dutch. Listen, I have a lot to do. Of course! Don't get angry. There is no reason. - Let us be clear. - That depends on you. - The whole story? - If you are okay with that. Well, I met Flavia by chance.. She was on a visit in Venice. She lived with her parents. I found her attractive and we went out together. But it just didn't work out. Then she met Fabio. She fell in love with him. They married quickly. We both were were just friends afterwards. But you were still in love with her? Yes, that's true. - Do you think they were happy? - No. At first, for a short time, yes. I understand. I doubt it. - Then Fabio showed his true colors. - He was a pervert! How do you know? - It's my job. - Very well! He wanted her to do crazy things. That's why she came to me. She told me everything. She trusted me. I can't stand it, Bruno. I can't take it anymore. He's constantly coming up with new schemes. He's mad. You have to leave him. - You don't stand a chance against him. - I can't... I can not... I love him. Flavia! Flavia! - If you want, I'll kill him! - Bruno! A incriminating statement, no? I swear I would have done it! Signore Nielsen it's not wise to make statements like that. But please, continue. She was desperate. Fabio, I don't feel like it now. Please, do it for me. Just one more time. - Please. - Only today, then never again. Never again! Open up! Go! - Good morning. - Come in. Where should this go? Help me with it. Give me the stuff, please? How old are you? - 17 - Already a man! Please go! I have enough. Good bye. You stupid cow! - Yes, please? - You were asleep? - Any news? - What time is it? Only 1o. I took a tablet. What do you want? - We need to talk. - We can do that tomorrow. It is very important. This can not wait. - It's about the conversation today. - With the Commissario? Go ahead! Not on the phone! I'm with you in 1o minutes. Get up and make some coffee. - How he treats her. - Just the right thing to do. Well, I'm waiting. Hello! Sit down! No, please! Don't you feel like a little lovin'? Not today, Marco. I don't feel well. Talk and then leave. I want to sleep and never wake up again. Do you want coffee? I need something stronger. - So? What is? - You have to be more careful. Regarding what? Everything. - What do you mean? - It's everything you do and say. You have the cops on your back. I have nothing to hide! Better think about your own problems. That's what I am doing. Selfish prick. I could destroy you if I wanted to. Watch your mouth! Pig! I hate you! - I'll teach you some respect. - Let go of me! Get your hands off me! No !! - No! - Don't you like my kisses no more? No!!! You pig. You like that, right? It turns you on. Hello, Marco! Who are you? A good friend of Marzia. What do you want? Here! Hold it, or I'll shoot! Looks like someone settled an old score. Doesn't look like a professional hit. The angry ex-boyfriend? Possible. Or better: probably! He left his business card. A 765er. Long out of fashion. And he took a bullet. The guard found traces of blood. This wasn't done by a contract killer. The ballistics experts have to look into this. Perhaps we can identify the owner. Good. One moment. I'm coming! - Pervert, you pervert! - Help, leave me alone! No !!!... No! - I'll show you! - Help! No!!! You stay here, you pervert slut. Slut! Stay here! Qpen up! Open! My dear, I warned you. I have to do it. I have to do it. It's for your own good! They never remember to flip the calender. What a mess! Poor thing. Such a terrible death. When did she die? Between four and five o'clock this morning. Unbelievable. Pure blood thirst. Last night he killed Marco. He was shot. Tonight he kills Marzia in such a sadistic manner. A blood rage. Do you have any doubt it was the ex-boyfriend? Idon't know. I can't think. It's way too early for my brain to function properly. One thing I don't understand. Why did he drown Flavia? Why did he pull her out of the water? It makes no sense. It drives me crazy. Don't forget: you're dealing with a madman. Crazies don't act logical. I just know that something is wrong! The intuition of a policeman. Five dead, but the first two do not fit into the picture. Commissario! Maestrini, what's up? No prints on the gun. But we found the owner. He bought the gun a week ago in Venice. And what's his name? Andrea Caron. 25 years, studied philosophy. Perhaps he's our man. - What do you want? - Come! Police! It's all legal. We have a warrant for you. What have I done? What's with your hand? - I cut myself on a can. - Really? May l...? Can, yes? Doesn't look like it. A gunshot wound. Beretta 9mm. A gun that's used by the police, the army... and many guards. Like the one you shot at yesterday. Signore Caron. So if you don't know anything... haven't been there and have nothing to say. -...I advise you to call a lawyer. - No! You are stubborn. As you wish. Just tell us the whole story. You are the policeman. I have nothing to say. About three months ago... you met a woman. Her name was Marzia. You were impressed. You fell in love. For a while you were a couple. But it did not work. She dropped you. She had enough of you. That's when you started calling her, all the time. You stalked her. Sent anonymous letters. - Like this one. Do you recognize it? - No. Read: "l won't leave you with this pervert bunch..." I'd rather kill you." Signed The initial of your name, Andrea. Andrea Caron! This doesn't prove anything. It gets better. You followed and watched her. You found out that Marzia had sex with three friends. Out of sheer jealousy you decided to kill all five. The prelude was the murder of Fabio and Flavia. You killed both by the canal. Then it was the prostitute's turn. Last night you saw Marzia in bed with Marco. It shocked you. You saw both having sex, You got so angry. When Marco left, you followed him. Right to the garden of his house. There, you shot him. But that wasn't good enough! Then doused him with gasoline. Am I right? Then it was Marzia's turn. Where are the scissors you used to kill Fabio and the hooker? Where is it? Tell me! - Where is it? - You are mad! Totally crazy! Once again forensics saves the police! Our guys found this at his apartment. Anything to say? Never seen it? Start talking! Confess! We were in love! You'll never understand. I loved her and she loved me! I know that. Then she got corrupted. It was awful. Yes, I was jealous. Marzia did not want to leave him. I was jealous of the hooker. Jealous of everyone who touched her. That's why I killed her. All three! I don't know who killed the architect and his bitch. Someone beat me to it. - I don't believe you! You're lying! - Why should I? I have told you everything! Three murders, or five... what difference does it make? - I believe him. - Me too, unfortunately. That was it. Makes three life sentences. But we're back at the beginning! Four suspects, two are now dead... One is behind bars and the fourth we ruled out Perhaps we underestimated Nielsen. Come in! Let's start all over again. - Thanks, Caputo. - Thank you! Only one remains! - What, no coffee? - No! Suspect four: Bruno Nielsen. We should pay him a visit. Mostly he's home. Works all day. And then... At around four he gos to the newspaper to deliver his work. - What time is it? - Almost half past four. Perfect! What are we waiting for? Good Evening, Signore Nielsen. Good evening, Commissario. - What's this? - No idea. Once you have offered us a drink... maybe you can tell us what this is doing in your apartment. I'll gladly offer you a drink. But I can not tell you where this thing comes from you. You know exactly what our visit is about. Remember, Fabio was killed with scissors. You're a comedian. I forgot. What? That he was stabbed with scissors that can be found almost everywhere. You think I am a suspect? It's been sitting on my desk for years. I cut paper with it. I doubt that's a punishable offense. - For you, too'? - No thanks. I don't like it, but I have to arrest you. - A bit premature, no? - Show him the warrant! Very well then! As you wish. I'm telling you what I know. But I swear... these scissors were not the murder weapon. - I'm listening. Good! There is not much to tell. On the day when it happened, Flavia called me. The two had reconciled. He hasn't been mean to her for quite a while. They wanted to renovate the apartment. She was looking at fabrics for new curtains. And they bought the right tools. Also a large pair of scissors. They went shopping at the Giudecca. Flavia thought Fabio would be window shopping... furniture for the apartment. He was an architect and had special tastes. Fabio bought the scissors himself? I don't want to speculate. I just said what I know. What you said so far does not improve your situation. You are the main suspect and you have a pair of similar scissors! Confess! You hated Fabio! And you wanted to kill him, to help Flavia. But why did you kill her? Gosh! I knew you have a vivid imagination! But that's a big fairy tale. I trust the judge's imagination is less flamboyant. You are under arrest, Signore Nielsen. I've expected you, Commissario. I understand, really. Yes. You seem unhappy. How is the investigation coming along? We're about to wrap the case. But you're right. I'm not convinced. Very good. What do you mean? There's a piece in the puzzle missing. Something that seals the whole thing. An event of which no one else knows. That nobody else has seen? Why didn't you say so earlier? No questions! Just listen! They had a fight, he wanted to force her to do something. She didn't want to do it. - You'll like it! Don't be such a prude. - Let me go! Don't be such a pussy. Get out! - You have to do that for me! - No! Please, darling! Do it for me. And what about me? You don't know what you're asking of me. Just one more time. This is important for me. Try to understand rne. You always say that. It's always the same. But I cannot go on like this. I love you, but I want to have a normal life. You're sick. You need help! You know yourself that something is wrong with you, Fabio. Don't act as if I was stupid and would not understand. I explore the nature of man. That hurts. But it is important to set us free from constraints. It is not for everyone. Can't you see how destructive this is? Don't cry! Well, I'll seek medical help. Really? Tell me that this isn't true. I promise! But how can a doctor help me? Will you try? Of course! But first, you have to do something! - Well, honey? How much? - 1o,ooo! Let's go then! - Only you? Or your friend as well? - Leave that up to us. You'll love it. No! Not like this! - Hold still, bitch! - No! What are you doing? - Let go of me !!! - Hold her tight! I don't want that. You pigs! No!!! I said I don't want that. No! No!!! That hurts! No...!!! Stop m Let go of me !!! Put her on the ground. Help me! No !! No!!! No! Bastards...! Bastards !!! You see... Bye! Now let's get out! - Good luck, Inspector. - Thanks, I need it. We're back at the beginning. We need to find these workmen. - It won't be easy. - I can help you. I see them every day from the window. The work at the port, not far from here. It will be easy to track them down. We killed nobody! - We didn't do it. - Why didn't you intervene? Why haven't you called the police? We were afraid. We did not know what would happen. - We wanted to stay out of it. - I tell you what will happen. I'll lock you up and throw away the key. Then you can think about what you have seen! Start talking! I had lost my cigarettes... so we went back. Stay! I want you! You're mine. That was an interesting experience right? Now it's my turn! I want you! Now you're mine. You're crazy. - I love you! - You are crazy! I hate you! I hate you! You bastard! Pay! You pig! No more! No more! No more! I can't stand it anymore. No more! Flavia! Don't do this! Flavia! Darling.
