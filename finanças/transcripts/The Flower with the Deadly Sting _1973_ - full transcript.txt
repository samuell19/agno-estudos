Don't worry, Mr Director... the operation went perfect l don't know about the results, but clinically it went okay. Doctor, its for you. Its Ms Daniella. If he lives, will there be further complications? Lets hope not... Excuse me for a second. Hello.. How many times do i have to tell you?... Dont bother me when i'm working No..

Yes or No Answer Me! Answer! We can't go on like this We must do something fast. We need a solution Understand? I have to proceed carefully. Two cuts to the jugular. Taking out the spinal cord... to halt rigor mortis. Medium abdominal cut to the lower pelvis. Now, I must deal with the bones. - I want to talkvvith Daniella. - She's not here Where are you going? I told you, she's not here. Are you satisfied? Where did she go? You're asking me? When did you two say goodbye? I Haven't seen her. She hasn't been here. She hasn't been here? I told you already... she hasn't been here. I know she was in this house. Listen, between Daniella and you, my life is impossible I don'tvvant to hear anything about you two. Understand? Then tell me, why is her car parked outside? I don't know. Are you sure it's hers? Maybe itjust looks the same. Lookfor a better excuse, Adrian You're going to need it. You better pray nothing happened to her. Good morning, doctor. - Good morning- Do you know what the newspaper is saying?... If it hadn't been for your operation, he wouldn't be alive The newspaper? They always make conclusions too quickly Very good. I want to see the reports from the 1st floor patients. Here they are, doctor I called you two or three times. I disconnected the phone, I was very tired. Come, sister. At last, Doctor! Please... tell the nurse... Tell her I Can't stand anymore suppositories... Well, how about injections? Does that make you happy? Easy.. I said we'll give you injections, instead. Alright? Injections? In my ass, too? Christ! Come on, What are you doing novfi Good God!... Don't you know smoking isn't allowed in a hospital? WelLjust for a moment I'll give you medication for energy... You'll be ready for your wife. No! No! Not my wife! No! Don't let her come!... I'd rather play with myself! - Doctor, how is he? - He'll be better soon Number 22 had a peaceful night, Number 27 had attacks again Perhaps its time to operate. I don't think so. - Doctor.. If its alright, can I take over. I'm Finished. Yes, But I'd like to see the patient first... In here. Let me see the report. Doctor, pardon me There's a man here to talkto you He says it about something very private I told him to wait in your office. Ricky, finish this, I'll be right back. Very good, Doctor. Morning. - Good Morning- Doctor,l'm sorry to take you from your busy schedule I'm Inspector Garrano from Central Precinct. What is it? I need to ask you some questions. If i can help... I will. What do you want? A lady by the name of Evelyne Graffi She Reported her sister missing Daniella Grafii, More correct - her half sister. You know them, right? Yes. We're Friends - Thanks Since its myjob to investigate thats why I'm here I'm hoping you can help me, Doctor. I'll be glad to. Sit down, please. I'm Sorry, But I must ask some personal questions. Tell me, how is your relationship with Daniella Grafii? Normal. Not important, I'd say Plus, under the circumstances... you know how those things are. Yes. - So you dont see each other any more? - No When did you see her last? She phoned me a few days ago. I'm sorry doctor, when did you see her? Let me think about that... About a week ago. Evelyne says you were the last one to see her sister. Could be. How long ago did Danielle disappear? Two days ago. - Two Days?- I Saw her about a week ago It'd be impossible for no one else to have seen her since Would you like a drink? - No, thankyou. Besides I dont think its anything to worry about. Why? Has she done this before? Well, she hasn't got along with her sister for a while. Her Step-sister Every once in a while she disappears... to relax To rehabilitate herself. Pretty much what I expected Plus, Daniella isn't a child... You're Right. Far from it. I know I've cost you some Precioustime, I Apologise. Dont worry, Inspector. I hope she's alright. I almost forgot... One more thing... Can you tell me why Danielle's Car is parked at your house? Now, that you mention it... I've seen it, too... I dont know why. A Red Herring. A misleading fact ...that's what we call it. Adrian, I... excuse me, Doctor... I just wanted to tell you the reports are ready. Well, Doctor... Goodbye. - Bye- Miss... Anything Wrong? Adrian? No. Nothing. Good Day. - Good Day- Who Gave you those keys? Daniella... does it make a difference? When? Why? ls it Important? No. Its not important. All I want to know is... Why are you in my house? I was curious. I wanted to know how you were doing Bad, Huh? You look upset. I have no motive. Oh N0? Maybe further questions from the inspector... Dont play games. What did you tell that cop? The Truth, Adrian. That's all. Damn! What truth? That Daniella did not come back home after being here with you. You're Crazy! Oh, yes? Very well. Then why are you so upset? I have never been happy since you entered my life. Not yours, Danielle's The truth is: you've always been jealous of our relationship Come on, Evelyne. This is not about her disappearance What do you really want? We already shared a bed a long time ago. What do you want novfi You want a repeat performance? Come some other day. Not now. Evelyne, please. Come here. Listen. I'm sorry. Dont cry. Evelyne, if you want to... you could help me. What? Can't you understand? You want me to drop the missing person report? Wouldn't that be the logical thing to do? You're a disgusting person! You'll pay forthis!... l know you very well. Daniella isn't here to stop me. And I wont feel any remorse I'll follow you until you screw up, I promise you! Doctor Vallenti? I've been looking for you Sorry to bother you again... It's about something important. I have some critical patients... I can't keep them waiting... It'll only take a moment... And it will interest you Can we go in your car? - Very well. - Thank you Hurry up. I can't give you much time. Hey Beautiful! When is it my turn? Please sit down. Both of you. Doctor... the lady says she has some facts about this situation I arranged for this meeting... so we could avoid further ones You said you didn't see Daniella Graffi the day she disappeared But you talked with her on the phone, right? I'm notjust saying it... Its the truth. Very well... what was said in that conversation? Well... nothing important She called me at the clinic to see howl was. Are you sure she didn't have anything else to say? Anything in particular? Positive? I'm sure. My memory is very good ...It was a simple call. Never the less... I'm sorry to insist. But according to this lady... something terrible has happened So we must consider the possibility of a homicide. You can consider anything you want, inspector... But what do you expect from me? Inspector! I heard the conversation on the phone... It was a nasty scene. Poor Daniella He was cursing at her. He threatened her... And then he invited her to his house I dont know why Doctor Vallenti wont mention this to you. Because it never happened! When my sister left. she was heading to your house! One moment... You didn't actually see Daniella go to the doctor's home No. I Didn't actually see her. That doesn't change anything. It changes everything. Inspector! Listen to me. This man is capable of anything! Please Keep calm. This is all nonsenseL. Inspector, you are illegally detaining me... My attorney should have been contacted Listen, before I completely lose my patience. I'm going to leave. Why did you let him go? What did you want me to do? Arrest him? Will you open? - Right away- - Did you call on the phone? - Yes, that was me At last... I've been calling for a half hour I thought something happened to you, No, Nothing. Nothing happened to me. But you could've told me... I tried, But for the past few days you disconnected the phone - Dont you want me here? - No. Dont say that. Then can i come in? Yeah. sure,l'm sorry Dont pay attention to me - I'm just a bit preoccupied. - I see - Have you had dinner? - No - Want me to make something? - No, I'm not hungry Would you like something to drink? Yes. Thank you. By the way... we had an emergency today... Doctor Rigaldi took care of it It was a serious relapse for patient 27 And they called from the ministry this morning There are problems with money for the new clinic But I'm sure the commission will approve the project Hey! Are you listening to me? Adrian? Didn't you hear me? Tell me again. About the money from the ministry... didn't you hear? Yes. That's good news. Thank you. Is there something bothering you? Why d'? You ask? You... - Listen, Elaine... - Can I have a cigarette? Good Evening. - Good Evening- Sorry to bother you at this time I know it's late, but... Someone brought this package for you They said it was very important. - Who Brought it? - A young man. Thank you, Ma'am. - Dont mention it. Good Night. - Good Night How Strange It Looks like a leaf from the plant by the stairs What is it? Adrian? - What? - Leave me alone! Look you better go now. Go. Please. Hello? Did you think you got rid of me? Who is this? You know very well... But who is this? I don't want you with anyone else What? What you're saying might be possible, but we can't prove it. Inspectonyou have to believe Daniella has never spent this much time away from the house. Doctor Vallenti says the opposite. Sure.. But Daniella would never do something like this She's still a young girl. - Not really Only on the surface. Just on the surface. I know her well.. She would have come back. Something terrible has happened I'm sure of it. Waiter! Do you want anything? Coffee, Please. Two Coffees, Please. - Right away, sir- I think Dr Vallenti is right she probably left to sort things out Youngsters do it all the time. No. Not quite I'm more than a motherto her. I'm more than a sister to her. More than a friend. More than a lover? Talk about lovers! Men want it all They dont give anything in Return! They are selfish. If i hadn't been with her... Men would have used her She has changed. Dr Vallenti has changed her He's brainwashed her. Your suspicions dont hold water You have reported her missing... and I'm doing myjob I always think of the worst... But I have no evidence to accuse Dr Vallenti plus, you shouldn't try to go against him He has powerful friends oh? Is that it? I want you to see something, Inspector ...Something I discovered about Dr Vallenti Look,this is the man protected by the influential. - I'll call him right away. - Thankyou You believe me, right? You're the only one who believes me... Hey! Give me a hand! A very pitiful human case, but not rare: often, in fact, a girl keeps her viriginity until marriage and shes severely traumatized... To the point to lock her in the madhouse? When her husband brought herto our clinic, she had very frequent attacks, almost non-stop... And you thinkthe cause of this trauma was the intimate intercourse with her husband? To be precise, her first one. A girl who repressed her intimate needs for so much time, can feel during herfirst intercoursasensations so violent which shock her mental sanity and jeopardize it... And then, of course, there are other reasons: the liberation from moral ties, the same fact to feel herself protected from the legality of matrimony... You know, in our country education is very rigid... So professor Vallenti has married a nympho... Well... in fem/words... At this point, he only had the option to send her to a clinic. The only solution? Or maybe the easiest one. What do you mean? What if I tell you ifs all a frame up by professor Vallenti, who marries the daughter of a famous and rich doctor, with matrimony he fixes his position and when his father-in-lavv dies, he inherits all hisfortune. After this, having become famous, ifs very easy to get rid of his wife. I can answer you... you're putting it down to yourjob. Do you thinkthey're all criminals? And you thinkthey're all insane? - Anyway we differ slightly. - l'm sure about it. Yep, I need evidence to arrest my criminals. Me too, I can prove that mrs Vallenti was ill when she was closed in this clinic. You can only prove that mrs Vallenti was morbidly hanged to her husband... quite a normal thing. Can you imagine how many Italian husbands would put their wives in the nuthouse? Professor Vallenti was forced to do it. Neither had you... We have some documents showing a strange coincidence: You, for the past five years have been the clinic's director Beginning the day Dr Vallenti told you to lock up his wife. Your insinuations are offensive, inspector... Absurd and offensive but before asking you to leave this place, l'd like to tell you that, thanks to our treatments, mrs Vallenti is now perfectly sane. And in fact we dismissed her and now she's free. Yes Free. Good Morning, Doctor. - Good Morning- What is it? - Telephone Line 2- Yes? Hello? Hello? No one is there. It was a womans voice. She said it was urgent. A Drink? - Yes- Cheers. - Yes- Now you believe me. Who gave you the keys? Daniella, if your so interested. If anybody tries to harm you... you know what to do... Sit on your front porch and watch the dead body of your enemy pass by. You seriously believe in superstion? Sometimes its true Look, he belongs to a very high society And sometimes we need to act very cautiously with them. Maybe I've been too impulsive with you, No... I would have done the same - Evelyne,l.. - Yes? Nothing. - Excuse me, Miss. - Yes? A young man brought these letters for Dr Vallenti. - ThankYou. - Your Welcome- - Good day, sister. - Good Day Dr Vallenti, please. I'm sorry he's not at the hospital. Do you know where I can find him? The truth? I dont know. He left a few minutes ago. Thank you. Very well. Then ifsfinished. But what guarantee do I get? Yes. But I want the documents, understood? Hello! hello! hello! - Good day. - Good day - ls Dr Vallenti at home? - No. He left a while ago. - Thanks. - Your Welcome Taxi! 198. 199. 200. There it is. Thank you. - Here. - Thank you Everything is in order, Doctor. Good.. Well, there's nothing left to do - Do you want to count it? - No need to - Good bye, Director. - Good Bye Put me through to Central Precinct. I did everything you told me to do... Go on.. Hello? Yes But who is this? Hello Hello! Hurry! You, through there. You, around back, You - with me Vallenti! Dr Vallenti! Open up! We know your home. Open up! It'd be better if you opened up! Inspector, Let me do it. Inform the station... You stay here. Vallenti! You son of a bitch! L never killed! l never killed anybody. Before I do anything... I want to Clear things up... Where did you hide your wife? Where did you put her? Nobody knows anything about her. Let me help you... - Miss Daniella... any problems? - None. Everything's in order? Give me a hand I'll help you out. - Thank you. - Dont mention it LadiesM/hat should we do? Take up the anchor? There's a beautiful place on the other side of the island. - No. We've had enough for today. - Okay. Wait. Let me help you, Can you give me a cigarette? What are you going to do after this vacation? I dont know. I'll probably go back home. And Adrian? Do you think he confessed to everything? At least he'll have to admit to killing the girl... Although it was an accident. Adrian never told anybody about having a girlfriend at his house He thought I didn't know about her Afterl killed her, Evelyne reported me as missing Then we eliminated Evelyne... We're geniuses, Right? Poor Adrian! He lost his power and hisfreedom!
