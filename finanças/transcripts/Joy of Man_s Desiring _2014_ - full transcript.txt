You've made it here. So you can consider yourself lucky. Because you'll have good times. Times that will change the way you see your life. You just have to relax. Have an open mind. You're safe with me. We can talk about anything. You can trust me. I'm your best friend. I'm here for you. Your time is just as precious as mine. We need to build trust, you and me. A lot of men and women can't build that kind of trust. But I think you can do it. If you have self-respect, if you're a gentleman... I'll show you my secrets. Everything has a price. Not always in money. But now we're talking about finances. Yours, mine. Your passions and mine are negotiable. OK, sweetie? Make sure you're in the right place. Understand what we're building here, OK? Because I'm not a machine. I don't have an on/off switch, OK? I'm not complicated, I'm open. Use your mind and senses to understand me, and we'll be fine. Be polite, respectful, honest. Or I'll destroy you, if I want to. THE WORKPLACE IS THE PLACE WHERE THOSE ARRIVING LATE CROSS PATHS WITH THOSE WHO ARE LEAVING EARLY. G. COURTELINE JOY OF MAN'S DESIRING Obviously we can turn metal into anything! It's rare for a facility to have such high-quality assemblies. We can't compare with the rest of Canada; it's just Montreal, but… Wherever, it makes no difference. Maybe it isn't the same everywhere, but it's the same grind, morning to night. When I got here, they put me on a certain machine. I like it, but nobody likes working on that machine! It's very fast. Some say I'm the one that's fast… But you can't go faster than the machine. I think it's possible with that machine. One time, the boss asked me to make three pallets. I made five. The average was three but you… No, no. He asked for three, but the order said five. The order said five pallets. So I made five. Quickly and well done… Yes, I don't even notice time. I work, I have fun, and honestly, I don't notice. When I work, I sing, I follow the machine's rhythm, I'm happy. But I don't like petty little jobs. You know that old man in the corner... If I sat at his machine, I'd fall asleep. It bores me. I can't do it. Watch, I don't go too slow or too fast. I watch my weld pool fill up. To protect it, you need this flux. Careful, wait. I'm going to bring down the hammer… There. Look at the flux. - You want to try? - Yes. Let's go. Careful. - Is it good? Can you see? - Yes. Does Morocco have a king? Yes. Hassan IV. Hassan II, his father, died. He's young, just 39… No, he's almost 43. He's young, but he's a king. I have a friend from England. I don't know if it's true, but she said Hassan and Prince Charles… - …are friends? - I mean, “close friends.” It's normal, they're royalty. They advise each other… Not just friends… lovers. I don't want to insult the monarchy. It might not be true, but if it's true… In Morocco, Hassan won't be very popular. Yes, yes. Customs, culture, religion and all that. People won't like it. There are religious fanatics, even in power. Working never killed anybody. Why take the risk? Working never killed anybody. Why take the risk? EVEN THE SMALLEST JOB HAS TO START WITH A GOOD BREAK. IF YOU'RE GOOD, WE'LL GIVE YOU THE WORK. IF YOU'RE VERY GOOD, YOU'LL GET SOMEBODY TO DO IT FOR YOU. I never used to work Saturdays. Now I work Saturdays. It's not that I don't care about the company. I care. This is half my life. I feel like we never talk, you and me. For three years, I've been on the same machine. It's my machine now. Nobody dreams of spending three years on the same machine. You never say: “Wow! I'd love to have my machine “for five to ten years.” It happens, that's all. That's how it is. My first day here, I saw all those guys. All the same: same head, hunched back, dirty hands. There was oil, dust, noise. I said: “No way, this is hell.” And then a boss came. He put his hand on my shoulder and showed me my machine. I was nobody. I didn't know anything. There was the machine and a paycheque at the end of the week. Security. Now I can almost do it with my eyes closed. This is the story of a young man. From the day he was born, his father said: “Son, if you don't know how to work for others, “you'll never know how to work for yourself.” The boy grew up with that idea. One day, his father added: “You know, son, the key to success and a good harvest “is a big gourd full of sweat.” The son grew up with the message: “Work, work, work.” He learned to like work, and looked for it everywhere. One day, a bad man said: “You want work? I have some for you. “See that field? Want to till it?” The young man said: “Of course, gladly. “How much will you pay me?” The man said: “I can pay you 2,000 CFA francs.” That's about $2. The young man was very happy with this and went to work. In the middle of the field, he stopped and asked: “You said I'd get 2,000 CFA francs, right?” The boss said: “Yes, but wait. “When the work is done, you must get me two things: “You must bring me 'aaah' and 'eee.'” The boy asked: “What are 'aaah' and 'eee'?” The boss said: “Don't worry. You'll try to understand later.” The young man went back to work and soon finished tilling the field. He asked the boss for his money. “No. I said you'd have to go get me 'aaah' and 'eee.'” The young man pondered this. All day and night, he pondered. In the morning, he got up and took a small black flask. He went into the brush and found a spider and put it inside. With some tongs, he captured a scorpion and put it in the flask. He went to the boss and said: “Here's your 'aaah' and 'eee.' “Put a finger in the flask “and you might find them.” The boss stuck a finger inside, and the scorpion stung him. He screamed: “Aaah!” The young man laughed and said: “You've found 'aaah, ' “now put in another finger, and you'll find 'eee.'” The boss said: “No, that's OK. Take your money and scram. “I don't want to see you again.” The young man was one of the few to get paid by the man, who was a notorious crook. He made people work, but never paid them. I kneel before You, in Your sight, bereft of all work. I have done nothing, I believe, to offend you and make you rob me of my dignity as a woman. I need to find a job that gives me strength and courage, and above all, that lets me feed my child. I put my fate in Your hands. Send a sign and I will obey! I am going to look hard for work. I know you will be with me. May Thy will be done! I'm going for coffee. Anybody want some? I'm going for coffee. Anybody want some? You're a little bit depressed, eh? It's not that I don't care about what's going on in the company. I do care. This is half my life. But now, I don't want to work anymore. I'm the same way. But aren't you just low on energy? No. My hands are doing things my brain doesn't want. Do you sometimes think it could be worse? I don't sit around imagining the worst. Do you? Yes, I tell myself it could be worse. Does it help? What I like right now, is that I have no time to think. It happens, then it's done. Then there's a new “now” and another, another. So yeah, I tell myself it could be worse. You don't think about what you've endured and what's coming? Never. I do. All the time. We're different. Yeah. Hard work never killed anybody. Why take the risk? Hard work never killed anybody. Why take the risk? - They told me you were depressed. - Yeah. - Is it serious? - Yeah. - Can't work anymore? - No. Time is going to drag. At least I'll find some. You're dark. I'm ambitious and dynamic, with an excellent sense of humour. What do you do? I want the job you're going to give up. I'll give it to you, free! You've never worked? Once. They didn't want me there. Why? I was there, they ignored me. Everybody worked around me, like I was invisible. I was nothing. I tried. I walked, I explored, I made myself available, but it was no use. Everything passed me by. I was nobody... part of the scenery. I left. POTABLE WATER Everybody's on vacation. Who are you? A depressed worker. Well, aren't you dramatic. I'm realistic and lucid. No, go away, you're bothering me. And you? No vacation for you? Who are you? An unemployed woman. Just help yourself, everybody's gone. It isn't that easy. I need to find a job that gives me strength and courage, and that lets me feed my child. I put my fate in Your hands. Send a sign, and I will obey! No, you're bothering me, go away.
