"Yes". - I don't know everyone says like that! - Well...every nonsense you do! So...Probably you understand me Until the New Year there are 8 hours 11 minutes As the people say... If at 00:00 AM to write on paper a wish Then burn this paper and ashes to throw in a glass of champagne And drink it...Then the next morning you will have heartburn As a surprise waiting for you live performance group "Neschastniy Sluchay" which will start after 00:00 AM it doesn't quench hunger! How do I get there? - She enraged me so, Sasha..I forgot about all... - So, I didn't have time. - Sorry! - I'm really sorry! - Well, OK - Every time I promised her and don't do that again - And and this bullshit "soon" and "fix it"... - She is so delicate and don't say anything! - And Vika doesn't answer me at all Write to her:"Marry me!" - She's gone, Lyosha - She left for the sake of these words! - She has a man... - Leave the phone alone - She should you somehow catch! She deliberately makes me suffer! Its a dirty trick! - And what is the name of the fact that you will not marry her for 10 years? - Left your phone... - What do you want? Of course I'm not just holding the phone Vika left and stopped answering calls and sms I'm still waiting! And I noticed that I began to turn on the sound and put the phone display down Not logical? Then I realized! While he is in that position, there is a chance that she answered, and I have not yet seen Take it...and "You have a new message" And you open it slowly.. As if she looks at you and you are worried Open..."Buy gifts in the market online Nokia" Terrible disappointment but also relief! You expect from her about forgiveness words But as written would be another negative words from me And so again you can hope for a good message What's wrong with me? I think that the phone is a symbol of the phallus My dear, you're dead! - Now send police squad to us, I invited - Well done! But how? And you don't know, how? We will be very grateful! - Prepare money! - Yeah, OK. Thank you! - I still don't have time... - But you write to her:"Marry me!" - Why do you advise him? He is afraid that she will not return to him But it will be even more afraid that he would return! He will have to marry! - Marry...marry... DJ Max 3 years lived with a woman, then got married They broke up after 3 months ago! Stamp in the passport changes something - As well as a need? - I don't know...v.v. - Marina, I love you so much!

Be free and love each other! - But how did you know? - They said! - Serious novel? - I don't think so... I don't trust him anymore! - And what? You forgive him? - No, he didn't confess me If he had said "Darling, I didn't want it" "I will not do it again anymore" I would forgive! - But I would have killed him! - And I also would have killed! - It may be nothing, Nastya? After all, he said that there was nothing! - Probably wasn't! - Really? - Yeah! I think so... - How do you know? - About what? - That nothing was! - I don't know! - So it was?
