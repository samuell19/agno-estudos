- [Principal] Valedictorian, Alex Gatewood. (audience applauding) (Alex sighing) - Today, the day of our graduation, it is not only a high school which we leave today, it's adolescence. The road that lies ahead of each of us is a different one. (crickets screeching) We must each take what we've learned, and use it to guide us through. (gunshots booming) (somber music) (water running) (car honking) - [Megan] Michael, I hope this letter finds you, I need your help, we're selling the farm. Come home, 18 years is an awfully long time.

Hi. - Hi. - I missed you. Did you get my letter? - Yeah, yeah. - I didn't know where to send it to, I didn't, I didn't think you'd get it. - Hey Megs. (Megan laughing) - How are ya? - How are you? - Hey Philly. - Michael! - [Phil] Hi Carrie. - It's so good to see you. - Ada, you're gonna freeze. - Hey Phil. - Hey Michael, how have you been? It's been a while man. - Yeah. - You like this, I did it myself. - Yeah, I could tell. - What about you man, you look like shit. New York doing that to you? - Thanks. - Give him a break, he's been driving for two days. - It's like I said, he looks like shit. - How long are you gonna be staying with us. - Just a couple days. - Did you bring those boxes? - Sure did, sure you're gonna need all of 'em? - I don't know, Marcia said whatever we don't pack, she's given away so. - So is Ray coming? - Yeah, he's invited. Excellent, excellent, excellent, oh two sizes too. - Yeah, yip. - So why are you selling this place? - My dad and Marcia got divorced. - Phil, come here, help me out, will ya? - Yeah. Yeah. - Thanks. - Stop fucking around. - Here, I could take some more. - Take these, and I'd take these two. Oh great. - Got it? - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh sorry. - Last summer was pretty fucking ugly. Marcia got the whole farm. Oh god, why am I carrying this? No, it's okay, got it, got it. Can you just bring the rest? - Yeah. I gotta get my stuff out of the trunk. - Okay. Hey, I'm glad you came. You look good. Phil! - Great. - Here, take these, I gotta pee. - Carrie! Shit! Oh whoa, why? - When did you get this? - I've had it for a while. - Wow, thanks for calling. - I'm sorry. - Hey Megan. - Hi Ray. Thanks for coming. - Yeah, it's no problem. - Well, let's go for a ride. - Hey ray. - Mike. - How you been? - You know, same as always. Are you holdin' on? - Yeah, I sure am. - You're gonna kill yourself with that thing! - (laughs) How was your drive? - I came with Phil, what do you think? - [Megan] Totally, which one do you want? - Oh yeah. - [Carrie] Pig. - We'll take this one. - You feed the fuckers once, and they never leave you alone. Stop it, Jesus. (gunshot booming) - Oh god. Look, I know you don't understand why. - You ain't gotta explain it to me, okay. - No, you're right I don't, but I'm-- - Why don't we just leave it at that. - I mean if that's what you want, I guess we just, we won't talk to each other then. - Why did you come back? - Why are you here, Ray? - I'm not the one who ran away. - You don't understand. - What's to understand? It's pretty clear how you feel. - What do you mean? - You didn't even stay for the funeral. - No I didn't. - He was your friend. (crowd laughing) - He was dead. - So are you surprised that he came? - Who? No. - He looks good, doesn't he? - I don't know. He looks different. You look good. So I haven't talked to in awhile. - I know. Sorry, it's been really crazy. - I know I've been busy. Well, how are you? - Good. So you and Phil are living together now? - Oh my god, no. He wishes, he got kicked out of his apartment. - Again? - That's what happens when you don't pay the rent for three months. - Oh, so you let him move in with you. - Temporarily. He cooks. Meg? - Mm-hmm (affirmative). - Don't expect too much, okay. - What do you mean? - It's just that you always expect so much, you get your hopes up and then you get let down, I don't wanna see you hurt, and the fact that everyone showed up is already amazing. - I know. - Okay. It's just that, you know I feel like we've all quit, and I can't just, well, it can't be because of Alex. - This isn't a good idea. - You know, it's kind of morbid if you think about it. A last goodbye. I mean it is what you guys think is going on here, right? That's really sick. - You seem to have it all figured out. - Yeah well, when it comes to you two, I do. I mean you guys are fucking better than "Bonanza". It's classic, I mean you run away, you stay mad, now you're both back here to battle out. Megan's master plan is coming together very nice. - Her master plan? - She's pretty smart, I mean think about, she managed to get you back in town, right? You guys are so pathetic. - You know you've become very observant in your free time, I guess flunking out was a good thing for you. - Yeah and you used to be a lot of fun. Lighten up. - Here, I thought you guys might want these. - Thanks. - Hey. You sure your husband's not gonna mind me sleeping on the sofa when you get married. - You think I'd introduce you to somebody I was gonna marry? - You're just saying that, 'cause you love me. - Yeah, get the groceries out of my car. - Come on guys, let's go bond. - You know I remember that I just had plans, but I'll try and get around it, it's okay. No, yeah, that sounds great, we'll work it out, Friday night? - Who's she talking to? Who you talking to? - Fuck off. No, nothing, no, sure it sounds great. I'd love to. - [Megan] Hey, when do you guys turn on that pump? - Yeah, I'll get it. - No. - What time is the game on tonight? - I don't know, seven. - [Phil] This is the year. - You say the same thing every year. - Yeah, but this year is different. - I gave up a long time ago. - It's too frustrating to be a Houston fan. - [Phil] You guys ain't got no faith. - You want me to do that? - I think I can handle it, I'm not a total fuck-up. - Yeah, don't bet on it. I heard that. Give me one of these. - It's still warm. It's okay, cold beer makes me fart. - [Ray] You know what the fuck you're doing? All right! - I hope they don't argue all weekend. - Guys don't argue, they compete. It's a penis thing. (Megan laughing) Works as compensation I guess. - So, who's more competitive? - [Both] Ray! - Definitely Ray. - So that means Michael got the bigger. - What, you don't know? - He was Alex's best friend. - So? - I never would have cheated on Alex. - What about now? It's too bad, he's got a great ass. Maybe I'll do him. You know, it could be possible that Michael and Ray have latent homosexual feelings for each other. Can you imagine those two making out? - No. (both laughing) - What? What? - You boys are so cute. (upbeat music) - Son of a bitch! Shit! Shit! Shit! - Oh Phil. - Turn off the pump! Damn it, it's not even on. - It's not? - Turn the pump off! - That's what I said! - Oh, it's losing pressure. - Phil, where is the pipe? - I don't know. - Where is it? - Is this it? - Yes. (upbeat music) - I need a wrench. - It's in the kitchen. - [Megan] Hold it on, hold it on! - All right, here it is. - [Carrie] I'm all wet. - You have to turn the pump on first. - I know. (Megan laughing) - Why don't you just leave it, let the stepmother do it? - Ex-stepmother. How are you. - It's a bit weird. - Because of Michael? - It's got nothing to do with it. - You know, you're mad at him. - If he wants to blame me, that's fine, he should just come out and say. - Nobody's blaming you Ray. It was an accident, you've got to get over this. - I've tried. I've replayed that night so many times in my mind, just tryin' to figure it out. It never makes sense. It was so dark. I guess I tripped, or I got turned around. I never thought he'd be in front of me. There's not a day that goes by that I don't see his face. (somber music) (knocking) - You know it's bullshit? - What religion or God? - Christianity. - Oh, do enlighten us please. - Think about it. You have all these guys, okay? And they're following this one guy around, and he is telling them about all this miraculous shit that he's able to do, right? Walk on water, and turn flesh into bread, blood into wine. They were stoned. - Who? - The disciples. Come on, they were junkies, and Jesus Christ was a drug dealer. See, he got everyone so baked that they really thought they saw him, you know, do all this miraculous shit, and you know, that's the way it was, but then what happens is, is that the Romans, they come up with this "Just say no" slogan, right? And they string him off, Christ dies, and you know, there's no more drugs. So the disciples, they decide to have that one big, you know, last blow out in order to pay their respects. They get together, they get so fucked up that one of the disciple guys, he looks off into the distance and he says, "He's risen from the dead." So, of course the rest of them think they're rising from the dead too, and then, withdrawal hits., and they get so strung out that they start writing all this nonsense about Noah's Ark, and Adam and Eve, and Moses. I mean come on guys, have you read that shit, it's pretty crazy. - [Michael] So when did he drop out? - Freshman year, second semester. - His grades? - No, let's just say, I was not cut out for the collegiate experience. - Man, that boy can cook. - [Carrie] Yeah, told you, he was good for something. - What did Gary want? - So that was who was on the phone. What did Gary want? - Who's Gary? - Just a guy. - He's just some puts. - You're in school, right? - Yeah, actually I was thinking of taking next semester off, and get away for a while. - Get away from what? - How much do you have left then? - In school, June, two and a half years, depends. - [Megan] It sucks we're not gonna graduate together. - [Ray] Some of us won't graduate at all. - Fuck you, Ray, okay, besides I don't need college, they don't have a degree in my field anyway. - What, bullshit artist? - Hey, I cause controversy, I get people stirred up, they wanna do things. - Yeah, like kill you. - Stop being so fucking apathetic about everything. - Please, you're the poster-child for apathy. - Oh, look who's talking. (Phil laughing) - Look, why don't you just save your bullshit analysis till you actually have the degree, okay? (somber music) (gunshot booming) - Okay this is called Sniper, and it goes like this, we go around the table, one at a time, and each person has to choose a movie, and then the rest of us have to guess the scene in the movie where a sniper could've changed everything, but you can't think about it, you gotta say it really quick, or else you got to drink. - I don't get it. - It's easy, I'll give an example. "Rocky", you know the scene where he's running up the steps? And he jumps up and down in the air. Right there and then, bam, a sniper would have changed everything. All right, go! - "The Sound of Music". - "The Hills Are Alive". ♪ The hills are alive ♪ - You guys can't sing, you see, right then and there, he would've taken out Julie Andrews, she'd have rolled down the hill, and that would've changed everything. All right, fine. I'll take a drink. - Okay. (all coughing) - oh yuck. - All right, now it's your turn, go! Ah, it's too late. Drink. (all laughing) - Oh boys. - All right, Megan, go! Holy Shit. - "A Streetcar Named Desire". - "A Streetcar"? - Yeah! - What the hell, where would in "Streetcar" would a sniper make a difference? "Streetcar", "Streetcar", Streetcar". - "Stella!" (all laughing) - [Megan] Ray saves the day. - I'd drink to that. Oh god, Ray, you gotta pick a movie now. - A movie where a sniper would make difference. - [Phil] Right. - "JFK". (all laughing) - You are so mean. (laughs) (upbeat music) - No, can't use that man, it burns my fingers. - Here. - Okay. - This is much better. - What's the matter? - Nothing, I'm just tired. - Why don't you go to bed? - I'm not that kind of tired. - (coughs) it's probably better anyways, I mean look what happened last time we all hang out, right? (somber music) (gunshot booming) - [Michael] Alex! - Come on. - You okay? - I shouldn't be here. - What did you expect? - Wait a minute. - What? What, what is it? - What am I doing here? - Phil's right, I mean it's sick. - I'm sorry you feel that way. - I mean this has got to be hard for you. - I just want you in my life again. - I am. - I hate it. - This won't work. - Give it a chance. - Okay. (upbeat music) - You watch a lot of TV? - Not really. - I love TV. It relaxes me. You should watch more TV. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. You're too stressed out, man. You have to relax a little bit. - So I should watch TV. - Yeah, or get laid. When was the last time you got laid? (laughs) Yeah, well. TV's safer anyway. They don't bullshit you like women will. I watch a lot of TV. I like game shows the most. It's real life you know. I got this idea for my own game show. Check this out. You got like these three contestants, and they answer questions, like on "Jeopardy", right, except if they're buzzin' in, and hittin' that clicker to answer questions, they're wearing like these helmets with these big fucking bells on 'em, and they got these wooden mallets, and every time the wanna answer a question, they gotta hit themselves in the head with this big fucking mallet.(laughs) I didn't think that shit would be so hysterical, man. (belches), three idiots hitting themselves on the head to answer questions. It would be so cool. Especially in Japan. (both laughing) Japanese love that shit. - You make this shit up, or do you just think about it? - No man, I think about stuff like this all the time. I've got a lot of ideas. Couple of 'em are actually pretty good. Seriously. I mean I got a lot of ideas about a lot of things. - Sure. (Phil sighing) - Hey you know something. I really missed you man. Glad you're back. (Phil belching) - I'm gonna go puke now. - Have fun. - I always do.

When I was little, that was all my dad would listen to. Hated it, every time I got into the car, he had the radio tuned to the same station. Country music. - So you're a little bit country, and a little bit rock 'n roll. - Not exactly. I just went out with this guy, and his dad owned a kicker club, and I kinda liked it. Do you know how to two-step? - No, does Phil? - I don't know, no, why? - But you do see him a lot though? - Yeah, I guess, I guess I do. I would see Megan more, but every time try and call her, she's really busy you know. We try and work things out, but we never get together in the end. I don't know, it's kind of weird between us these days. - What about Ray? - Ray had a hard time. I mean we all went through it, but he had it the worst. I remember his face when they took him in the cop car. I don't think he's ever been the same since that. - Do you hate me for leaving? - Come on, I'll show you how to two-step.

Phil, stop it. - Come on Carrie, you know there's a dark side to you, and you know that dark side wants me. - There's no place on this planet dark enough for me to ever want you. - Sure there is. - Phil, I said stop it. - Phil! - Carrie. - Fuck you, Phil, fuck off! Fuck off! Jesus Christ, you're so fucking stupid. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself, do you? As long as you're fucked up, and having a good time, you don't care who you're fucking with, do you? (Phil clapping) You're fucking good, you got talent. - Fuck you. - You already have. - Get out! - Oh come on, you sure you don't want a little quickie? - Get out, get out, get out! No! You wanna fuck me, Phil? Huh, you wanna fuck me. - Too late. (Carrie sobbing) - No! - What? - I was just thinking about how. - But she likes you. - So? - So, you should ask her out. - She's not my type. - What are you afraid of? - I'm not afraid. - Then ask her out, it's one date, what's the big deal? - Why is this so important to you? - It's not. - She'd make you happy. - I'm happy now. - So? What about now? Any meaningful relationships? (upbeat slow music) Are you afraid of rejection? I think I'm more afraid of commitment. - You've never shown your depths to anybody, have you? - So I guess what really bothers me is that he just let her have it. I mean he fought her on everything, the cars, the stocks, the house, but he just gave her the farm. And then he said by that point, he just wanted end it. Give her what she wanted, make her go away. - Why do Marcia want the farm? - She didn't, she just didn't want him to have it. - And it wasn't his, I mean your mother left it to you. - Yeah, but I was so young when she died that everything was left in my dad's name, you know that. - And Marcia was entitled to half. - Why don't you talk to her? - All right, that wouldn't do any bad. So? Are you inclined to stay? (upbeat slow music) - Yeah. - Why? - A lot of reasons. - So what were they? You never fell in love ever? (gunshot booming) I'm sorry. No! I can't, it's just not right. - What? You were his girlfriend. - He's gone, Michael. - Sorry. - I don't get you. What do you want? Hey. You're gonna drown. (keys jingling) (car engine revving) - Oh, where are you going? - I'm leaving! - What's the matter? - Get out of my way. - What is wrong? - Oh no. I need to go! - Fine! - Fine! - Fine! - You wanna get out now? - No! - Fuck, I just fucking can't do this! - What, what? (Carrie sobbing) - God damn it. - What, what? (Carrie screaming) - You're okay. - You don't know what I'm going through. - Yes, I do. - Oh god, guys are such assholes. I treat them like shit though. I do, I know I do, you know what, I'm just so fucking confused, I don't know what to do. I just want. I just want out. This sucks. - I know it sucks, it does. - Ugh, fucking jerk! Oh, the fuck am I gonna do. I don't know what I wanna do. (somber music) (Carrie sobbing) (Ray sobbing) (gunshot booming) (Phil snorting) (Phil coughing) - What are you doing fella? - I wanted to come out here so bad. I didn't think it was gonna end up like this. - I did neither. - I didn't mean what I said, or what I did. - Yeah, you did. People don't say things, unless they partially believe 'em, right? - Why did you sleep with me? - Oh god, that was a long time ago. I was drunk, I was upset, I didn't know what I was doing. It was a mistake, I'm sorry. - I guess I just thought it really meant something. - Sex means nothing to me. Most guys will do anything for sex, and once they've got it, they're gone. I don't want you to be like the other guys. I don't want you to leave me. - Why would I go? You see through my best bullshit. That keeps me on my toes. Do you remember the day we skipped school, and I helped you look at cars? - Mm-hmm (affirmative). - I mean we must have spent the whole day test driving every car known to mankind, and later that day when I dropped you off, you looked at me and you said, "I love you". I know it was just in a friendly kind of way, but, and you went inside, I actually did a, a back flip in your front yard. Of course the next morning when I called, you were gone, and then that Monday you pulled up in your brand new Jeep. Ray and Michael along for the ride. We never looked at Jeeps. I guess I'm just trying to explain why sometimes I'm such an asshole. Now after Alex died, nothing made sense to me anymore, except being with you. You know somehow that makes sense to me. - Oh god. I wish I could say the same. It's not that I don't care about you, 'cause I do it's, it's, oh god. (sighs) Phil, you don't need this. - I love you. It's okay. I'll wait. (Carrie sighing) Does this means I could sleep on your couch now? (both laughing) - Not a chance. (upbeat music) (somber music) - Oh guys, come on! (television murmuring) - Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, let's see something here. - [Michael] Nothing's gonna happen this time. - [Phil] All right. Don't catch that. - No don't. - Don't catch that. Son of a bitch! - Oh god damn it. They're gonna lose. - I don't wanna watch this. - Hey. - Hey, come on. - What? - Turn it back on. - What's the matter. - I thought you didn't care. - Turn it on. - All right. (television murmuring) - oh yeah, I can't see. - It doesn't matter, there's nothing to watch anyway. - Sit down! (Phil sighs) - Oh, let's go you, merries. - Nice outfit on. - What, what? - Nothing. - Come on, let's go! (all cheering) - we're coming, hang on. - Go ahead, I'll meet you out there. - No, I'll wait. - No, it's okay, go ahead. - All right, I love you. (television murmuring) - come on let's go. Oh baby, oh baby. - They're not gonna do it. - Oh no, no, come on, come on. - They're not gonna do it. - Come on, come on. - Oh yeah. - Yeah, go, go, go, go, go. - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - Come on. - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Yes! - Yeah! - Yes, yes! - Oh my god. - Told ya, you didn't have any faith, man. - Oh yeah, right. - Yeah, this is gonna be the year. - Look at that replay. - Look at the replay. (both laughing) - Come on, let's go hunting. - Jacklighting's not hunting, it's killing. - Hi. - Is that for me? - Here. - This weekend's not what I expected it to be. - I'm sorry. I just. - How did we get here? We're so fucked up.(laughs) People are graduating college, they're getting married, they have careers, they have kids, and I feel like we're in this hole, waiting for something to come lift us out. I'm barely treading water. I'm not doing anything. - I just didn't know what to do. - Oh, you're not getting me. My dad wanted to be the one to tell me that he and Marcia were gonna get divorced, but he couldn't speak because he was crying so hard, and I've never seen my dad cry, I mean I thought he was a strongest man alive. He cracked. And to see your parent like that, it just makes you realize that it doesn't matter how old you are, you're still gonna fuck things up, it's just that you have to learn how to deal with them, or you die. Why did you run away? - I wasn't running. It's complicated. - Talk to me Michael. Yes, you can. - No, I can't. Don't you get it, damn it, I would talk to you if I could, but I, I can't why can't you understand that. - Look at yourself. Are you planning on running away for the rest of your life, because I don't think there's anywhere in the world, that's gonna be far enough. - Oh, what, run you son of a bitch. - Go, go, yes! - Yeah! - Fuck yeah. - Do you wanna know. Do you wanna know why I came back here, why I dragged myself back here, because I'm so tired. I'm tired of being afraid. (somber music) I'm so tired of being the only one that knows the truth. - The truth about what? - The truth about Alex. (tense somber music) (television murmuring) (Phil sighing) - What are you doing? - I have to tell you something about that night. - Excuse me, but not everyone is born knowing exactly what they wanna be. - I never had a choice. - Oh please, you've never had to work hard for anything in your life. I mean come on. You think you know what it's like not to know what the next step is, it's so easy for you. You will always get what you want, it's always been that way. - So, they tell me. - My prescription for you is, take six of these, and call me in the morning. - Yes Sir. - Let's go you, merries. - Oh, nice outfit. (Carrie laughing) - What? (birds squawking) (somber music) (gunshots booming) - [Ray] Get him! - Oh yeah. - I got him. - Get him! (Michael laughing) - [Ray] Die you son of a bitch. (gunshots booming) - No, Ray, no! No! - [Ray] Oh god. - [Carrie] Alex? Alex! - You knew, and you didn't tell me. - That's why I left. - That's why you left? How could you do that? How could you, how could you, how could you go, and tell me one? - I couldn't. - You could, and why not? You son of a bitch. - Come on, Ray, don't do this, man. - You son of a bitch, why not? You motherfucker. You son of a bitch. Tell me. Why didn't you tell me? Why don't you wanna? Tell me why, tell me. (both sobbing) - Because it was my fault. He came to me for help, and I did nothing. I didn't know. I couldn't stop it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (door slamming) - Jacklighting's not hunting, it's killing. (gunshots booming) - [Carrie] Michael! (somber music) - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - [Michael] Oh, I'm sorry. What are you doing? - It's gonna be okay. (upbeat music) (spoons chiming) (birds chirping) - I'm sorry. - It doesn't matter now, what's passed is past. Tired of being angry. I was always competing with you for his friendship. The truth is back then, I never really knew him as well as I knew you. (upbeat music) (birds chirping) - Hey, hey there, Mikey. Don't go getting your nipples pierced, okay. - Yeah, we'll see. - Take care of yourself, Michael. - I will. - You two, try not to kill each other, okay. I forgot to give you this time last time. You look good today. So long, Ray. - Okay. See you around? - You take care of yourself, man. - Yeah. You too. - [Alex] Today, the day of our graduation. It's not only an high school which we leave today. It's adolescence. From this day on, nothing is required of us by others, it's only ourselves that can set the rules by which we must follow. The road ahead for each of us is a different one. We must each take what we've learned and use it to guide us through, trusting ourselves to navigate correctly and efficiently. The barriers that lie before us are there to be broken. The power is in each of us to conquer whatever obstacles may stand in our way. Choose your battles wisely, and fight them well. For at the end of the road lies success, and with success at any level, happiness is sure to follow. I can only say that I hope to see each one of you on the other side. Congratulations, and good luck.
