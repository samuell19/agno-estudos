We got about 10 minutes, all right, so let's keep it clipping along. Jo?! My God, what're you doing here? - I should've called first, I'm sorry. - I'm not! Ha, ha, ha! That can't be Maddie! Remember me? Uncle Lyle? - I remember your pictures. - That's the saddest thing I ever heard. Come here, gimme a hug. Aunt Sandy's gonna flip to see you, Maddie-Lou. You like fish for breakfast? - I hate fish. - Heh, heh, heh, heh! She's your kid, all right. - Hey! You'll never guess who's back. - Charlie said he saw her down at the wharf and he said she looks like hell. Ha, ha, ha! - So would you if your marriage fell apart. - Joanna Johnson always thought she was too good for this town and everyone in it. It's about time she got taken down a peg. Anyway, she must be rolling in alimony... stockbrokers make big bucks. - ♪ Lately I've been wanderin' round, lookin' at the world ♪ - Didn't she sign one of those, uh... what do you call it? Prenuptial agreement! I think Sandy told me that. - Yeah. She used to baby-sit me. Man, she was hot! You think she's still that hot? - Poor thing's probably broke. Broke and depressed, that's why she's come back. You remember... the one who attacked the chemistry teacher? And ran that shrimper into the breakwater? And painted that graffiti thing on the back of the gym... - Right! Wasn't she expelled for that? - Actually she got a scholarship, some arty school. She took off outta here like a bat outta hell. - Good practice. Don't forget the game tomorrow. - She's still asleep? - In my bed. I really need to get online, Dad, I got lots of homework. - Who saved room for dessert? Maddie, do you like ice cream or whipped cream on your cobbler? - Um... Can I have both? - Watch out, she'll spoil you rotten. - Everyone needs spoiling now and then. Courtney, go fix your Aunt Jo a plate. - No, no. No, thanks. - You have to eat. - I'm not hungry. Really. - Chicken potpie, my specialty. - She doesn't want it, honey. - Wanna go watch some TV? - At least have a roll. So, did you hire a lawyer? - Ah, jeez, Sandy... - She drove all night, she slept all day... we're supposed to talk about the weather? - Yes, I hired a lawyer. - Good for you. Challenge that prenup. I don't care what you signed, the cheater shouldn't get to keep everything. - I hired a lawyer because Peter is suing for sole custody. On the grounds that I'm "emotionally unstable." - What? He dumps his marriage and kicks his kid out of the house and you're unstable? - He never kicked Maddie out. He made me leave because the house was his "prior asset" and Kimmee was moving in with him. But he didn't fight when I took Maddie. Now all of a sudden I'm "depriving my daughter of a safe, stable environment". This... this came yesterday. His lawyers are twisting everything to make me sound like... Okay, so I sat and watched the house, once, on our anniversary. Does that make me a stalker? And that crack about hoping his brakes fail... everybody knows that I didn't mean it. And as far as "financial instability" goes, I'm looking for a job, but... there's not a lot of demand for a homemaker with an Art History degree. - I bet he's scared you'll fight the prenup, so he's using custody to... - I don't care about the prenup! All I want is my daughter. I can't lose Maddie. - I need some help at the office. Clerical stuff. You can work while Maddie's in school and have the afternoons free. - And you can sleep on the pullout in the den, your old bedroom. Stay as long as you need to, till you're on your feet. - I'm sorry. I hate to do this to you, to her, pull her out of school and run, but I was just so afraid he'd take her away. And she... she needs a safe place and I just couldn't think of anywhere better than... - Home. - Oh, my gosh... You kept them. - Of course. I love them. Best thing you ever made. Except Maddie. You know, you've still got some boxes of glass and tools in the shed. - What about my silkworms? The Spellathon? And I'm making a banner for Math Day. - There'll be fun stuff at this school, too. And anyway, it's gonna be summer soon. Maddie, you'll make new friends. It's just for a little, little while. - This bed has pimples. - It's the sheets. It's called dotted Swiss. It's very fancy. I think it tickles. - Stop! - Don't touch anything. 'Kay? - Where's my rocking chair? - At the apartment. - Where's my bicycle? - At Daddy's. You know that. - We didn't bring anything good! - We brought this. Sandy, I'll do that. - It's done! It's done. It'll do. Now we just have to reorganize the basement so we can make room for the stuff in the closet so you and Maddie can hang your clothes. - Don't worry. This works. Look. - Ohh!! - Maddie! Maddie! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Are you okay? Are you okay, honey? Maddie! - Ow! Mom, I can't breathe!! - Oh, my God! I am so sorry! - No, that's okay, I'm used to dodging kids. - Laura, this is my sister-in-law and her daughter, Jo and Maddie. - Hi. - What do you coach? - What do you play? - I only play with friends. And we're leaving as soon as we get on our feet. - I guess we better become friends. Laura Lawton. - Maddie. Soccer. That's what I play. - Nice to meet you, Maddie Soccer. That's my house right over there. - Oh, you bought the old Lewis place? - Yeah. - What did you do with all those hideous little ducks and deer and... - You know, I'm starving. And the boys are at a baseball game and I hate to eat alone. So what do you say, Maddie, would you and your mom like to... - Yes, yes! Go! Take your time! Have fun. - Great. - Thanks. - So, you grew up in that house? - Yeah. After my dad died about 6 years ago, my mom left and then Lyle and Sandy moved in. It's gotta be hard making room for us. Sandy's very particular about her home. - Oh yeah, I'll say. She's just like my mother... a domestic Type A. Another trait I did not inherit. - It's just so good to see you, sweetie. How's your mom? I sent her an invitation to the wedding but she hasn't responded. - Mom's always good. What wedding? - My daughter's getting married in a couple of weeks. - You're kidding! Little Zoe? Wow. To think that Billie threw me out of here once for wearing a halter top. Oh, my God. Is that Matthew Silva? I recognize that baseball cap from high school. - Yeah. He's a nice guy. My husband helped him through probate last year. Was he really voted Most Likely to Blend into the Wallpaper? - Oh, my God, I forgot that part. Poor Matt. What's he doing with Charlie Crane? That man has the biggest mouth. My dad used to call him the Town Crier. I bet he's having a field day with me. - Yeah, well, small town. You gotta expect some idle gossip. - There's nothing idle about it. In Camden Bay, gossip's a blood sport. - My husband had this darling legal assistant, Annabelle. Really sweet, fresh out of community college. Anyway, she developed this huge crush on him, and word got out and suddenly it was all over town that they were having a wild affair. - Oh, my God... What did you do? - Oh, I laughed. I know my husband... he's the original stand-up guy, he wouldn't cheat on me. - So what happened? - He found Annabelle another job. But he was so offended by the gossip that he wanted to sue for libel. I said, "Honey, what are you gonna do, "sue the entire town? We know the truth, so let it go. In a week they'll be lying about somebody else." - And were they? - Oh, yeah. About me being bulimic. - Hey. How was Billie's? - Frozen in time. - Oh hey, perfect timing! You can meet my guys. Guys! - Oh no, it's your mom! - Mom, guess what? Dad owes me ten bucks! - Again? I thought I said no betting! - I plead the fifth. - Hi. - Jo, Maddie, this is my son Kevin and my husband, Scott. - Oh, my God... - What, do you know each other? - Uh... Yeah, it was Boston U. We, uh... we had a class together, right? - Poly sci. - Talk about a small world! - She, uh... sat in the back and slept, if I remember. - And you sat in the front and pontificated. - This is wild! - Did you know Peter, too? Jo's husband? I mean, ex? - No, no. I met Peter after college. Um, it's... it's bath time. Thanks for dinner. - Yeah, no problem, anytime. See you, Maddie. - What's Boston U? - Ancient history. - Wow! We should have her over for dinner so you two can catch up. - It was just one class, not a lot to catch up on. - All right. I'm gonna pull the car in the driveway. I'll see you at home. - Okay. Come on, monkey. - ♪ Maybe I need you... ♪ - Thailand... Costa Rica... someplace... someplace warm and beautiful. Or some old European city where I can... live cheap and do my art. - Told you you were burning up. - Oh, my God, that's so cold! What about you? Where would you go? - South Africa. Apartheid's dying. A lawyer could do some good. - South Africa, huh? - ♪ Making her feel all right ♪ ♪ Maybe I need you ♪ - How could this only be four months? I feel like I know you. - ♪ Everything moving ♪ ♪ Everyone always tired ♪ ♪ Thinking of futures ♪ ♪ Everything falls away ♪ ♪ Everything changes ♪ ♪ Nothing has changed today ♪ ♪ Maybe I need you ♪ - You want me to walk you to class? It's my first day, too. - Do you feel sick? - I've felt better. - Hey, Maddie Soccer! - What are those for? - P.E. Room Six. - That's my room. - Well, what do you know! Here, gimme a hand. - I'll see you at three, honey. - Bye. - Thanks, Coach. - My pleasure. Oh hey, I wanna hear all about Scott pontificating in class! So, what do you guys want for wedding gifts? Matching heart tattoos, prenuptial piercings? Thank you. - Nothing. - Money. - Tommy!! - What? - Tommy, I got stacks of filing. Come on over anytime. - Jo, I got a seat for you right here. - That's okay, Billie. I'm already late. - Jo, I need this typed and mailed by noon. - Okay. First tell me your filing secret. - Stuff that's happening now is up front, then comes stuff happening later, and on back. - OK, and things that happen, like, every three months, like taxes, where would those be? - In a box in my office. I'll get it. - She's baaa-ack! Looking good, Jo-Jo. - Thanks, Nathan. What can I do for you? - Well, I've been making a list since the seventh grade. But for now, all I need is the breaker's delivery order. But how about after work we hop in the 'Vette, go up to Peeler Point and grab a bite? - Thanks. I gotta pick up Maddie. - Maddie... how is that girl? I bet she's getting to be a real fox like her mama. - She's 10. - Right. - Don't you have deliveries to make? Tell Sandy I can't make dinner tonight. My sister's always trying to bulk me up like this guy. Lucky she wasn't home. Sheriff thinks it was probably just some homeless guy, a drifter. - The sheriff is a fool. This was a local. - Joanna. Come sit. - Yeah, take a break. Lyle won't fire you. - So why do you think the burglar's a local? - Because Lenore Riley was saving up to go to Vegas and he took her trip money. - Okay... - She was hiding it in her freezer, in an old TV dinner box. Now, what stranger would know to look for $200 there? It had to be someone who heard her talking about it. Someone in town. - Well, maybe he wasn't looking for money. Maybe he just wanted the TV dinner. Was it the good kind? With the cobbler and the... niblet corn? It's not funny! - This is pretty. Did you make this in Art? So what's your teacher like? Is she nice? What's your class like? - No Silkworms. Why can't we go home? Real home, not the apartment. I miss my room and my bed and the suns-and-stars window you made me. - I know. I know. I just don't... I just don't think it's a good idea for you to live with Dad and... Kimmee until they're married, and even then I want you to live with me most... half... lots... lots of the time. - Daddy said that when I live with him and Kimmee I can have a puppy. And a pool. - You promised her a puppy, Peter. That's bribery. No, I did not "kidnap" her; I brought her to visit her family and my brother needs help so I'm working here while she's in school. You only wanted to see her on the weekends anyway and you cancelled most of those! And now you're taking your trip to Greece and you wouldn't see her anyway! Unless, of course, Kimmee wants to take her with you. No, I didn't think so. No, Peter, I can't talk, I'm working! - Wow. Even more beautiful when she's angry. - Oh, grow up, Nathan. - You know, you better watch those mood swings, Jo-Jo. People might start to think you're... unstable. - Lyle, can I talk to you for a minute, please? - No! - Did Sandy? - No! Well, I don't... Well, he is her brother. - Who else knows? - Since when do you care what people think? Especially these people. Look, I need you to go to Kings Landing. I'm buying the old Franconi warehouse and he's got some papers for me. Take your time. And don't pay any attention to what Nathan says... no one else does. The ferry's still a nice way to get there. - Now boarding the Camden Bay to Kings Landing. Camden Bay to Kings Landing. - Okay, I owe you an apology, but you owe me an explanation. - We don't owe each other anything. - Come on, Scott! Why am I lying about us? And how the hell did you end up here? - You never said "Camden Bay." - You're right, I didn't. - Because I would've remembered. - Tickets, please. - So why didn't you just tell Laura? - I don't know, I... I panicked, okay? I just... I didn't want to get into it. - I don't want to lie to her... - I don't either! I never have before. What you and I had was so long ago, I... And it's not one of my favourite memories. I just... You're right, I gotta tell her. - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. But when I'm ready. When I think the time is right, I'll tell her. You owe me that much, please. - Okay. - Okay. You know, I used to drive the Bay Road to see my clients in Kings Landing, until I discovered the ferry. Now I ride it every chance I get. - When I was 10, I ran away from home. I didn't know where to go, so I just rode this thing back and forth from Kings Landing till I ran out of money. - You were running away even back then, huh? - That must have felt good. - It did. Cheap, but satisfying. - I have always regretted how badly I handled everything when we broke up. You were going through hell and you needed me, and I was... overwhelmed and young and I had all these dreams I wasn't ready to give up... - Jo, I never blamed you for leaving me. It's just how you left. You just disappeared. I mean, you don't know what that did to me... - I'm so sorry. - Your daughter's lovely. - Thanks. Your son is, too. - Funny how things work out for the best, huh? - Did you ever make it to South Africa? - No. How about you, Costa Rica? - The fog's coming in. - Yeah. Hey, what's up? No! When? Did he break up with her or did she break up with him? - Mom, she won't turn the music down! - I'm studying! It helps me focus! - I have to read! - It's my house! - Come on. This was my hiding place. One second. You can sit here and read until bedtime, okay? Okay. You won't let me cook, you don't like how I clean... - He's in the crease! - No way! Hey, that's a penalty! - Careful. There's lots of testosterone over here. - Can't be any worse than all the oestrogen over there. If I don't get an apartment soon, that house is going to spontaneously combust. - I run to the cemetery every morning, it's a great stress reducer. You can join me anytime. - Thanks. - You know, I heard an alarming story about you... crashing a shrimp boat into the breakwater? - Everybody forgets that I was with the owner's son when it happened and it was his idea, not mine. He'd drunk half a keg and passed out at the wheel and I'd never steered a boat. - Did you really attack your chemistry teacher? - Ha! Okay, okay. He was new, I was an A student, and he told me there was gonna be some kind of honour roll field trip to go see phosphorescence at night. So I go down to the tide pools with my bucket and my net and my poke-pole, and it's just me and him, but I don't get it. So we start collecting all these glowing sea stars and crabs and clams and things, and he drops his pants and exposes his... little neck. - Oh, my God! - So I stuck him with my poke-pole and I ran home. - Good! Oh, my God! - I won! I won! - You always win. I am going against reality. - What? - Yes, and you smell bad. - No, I don't! Whoa! - What are you looking at? - Oh! Nothing. Can't you sleep? - I don't care about a puppy. - Mabel saw only his back. He heard her coming and took off out the kitchen door. Took all the antique jewellery she had hid in her grandma's samovar on the mantle. - Did you hear? The burglar hit again, in broad daylight! And this time the lady was home. - Was she hurt? - No, but it's just a matter of time. Which is why we're having a meeting. Meeting adjourned. - We've increased patrols throughout town, but it might be wise to invest in a home security alarm system. Nathan, what are you doing?! - Camden Bay used to be a place where you never had to lock your door, let alone hide your valuables! - If I ever track down the bum putting us through this grief, he's gonna feel my wrath all the way up his... - Martha! - What's going on out there? - Know what I love about this town meeting stuff? - The grassroots activism? The sense of community? Billie's Bundt cake! - Yeah, you got it. Actually, looks like Nathan got it. - Did you tell Laura yet? - I tried. I... just the moment never presents itself or... or something happens, or... I know, the longer I wait, the harder it gets. Don't give me that look. - What look? - Your "I'm Gonna Roast You in My Furnace" look. It used to always give me the cold sweats. Are you still blowing glass? - Not for a while. No space or time. - That's too bad. I still remember your first piece... you came out of class carrying this... lumpy, malformed deflated volleyball thing. But your face was radiant. Beautiful. - Oh, my God! - Scott, you better get out there, Martha just took a swipe at the Sheriff. - Righto. Camden Bay... the action never ceases. - Your brother's a good man. But your dad, heh, heh! He was a ball-buster. He was always fighting me over territory. He cut my lines more than once, I'll tell ya. But Lyle's a fair man. - He feels the same way about you. - You know, you're just like your mother: you're sweet as pie when you're not raising hell. So, uh, how is Carolyn? - She's fine. She lives in Montana now, she's married to a rancher. He's a nice guy. - Anyway, I'll get the papers. So, uh, tell Lyle that my lawyer said that his lawyer should have one last look at that. - Okay. Thanks. - That's easy to be done in a codicil. Mm-hmm. Okay, well, how about tomorrow? Great. I'll see you then. Bye. Hi! - Hi. Sorry to barge in, but your assistant's... - Yeah, she's gone. Lamaze class. It's her third kid. You'd think she'd have it memorized by now. - I didn't know you were Lyle's lawyer. - I'm everyone's lawyer. It's a one-horse town, and I'm that horse. I work for free, for retainer, for cash, for credit. This I'm doing for my weight in sea bass. Hey, Jo... Forgive me if I'm out of line, but, um... if your ex is suing you for custody of Maddie on the grounds of emotional instability... - Oh, my God! Okay, all right! So I'm angry and sad and I'm overwhelmed and unhappy, and a little overwhelmed, but unstable? I mean, do I really seem unstable? - Maybe a little? Ha, ha! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Oh God, don't be. Don't be. You're fine. But if he is seeking custody, you have to start preparing letters from family and friends that testify to your stability. Sorry, I just... - No, not really. He's just competitive. It's what I loved about him at first... when he was competing for me. He made me feel so...treasured. After Maddie came, he was just home less and less and he was always at work, but I loved being a mom and we were figuring it out... - If there's anything that I can do to help, please just let me know. - Thanks. The letters are a good idea. Although I already have a lawyer. He doesn't work for sea bass, though. Fire him. Ow! Ow! - Here, let me help you... Um... I think I'm making it worse. Um... - With, um... with scissors? - Yeah. Yeah. - It's okay, you can just cut it. - Yeah? You sure? - Just a little. Oh, my goodness. - Yeah. - Ooh. Thanks. Ow. Okay. Bye. - See ya. - And with the glass and equipment that I have, I can start right away. And I'll still work my hours at the office. - What about Maddie? A big old warehouse is no place for her to play after school. - I'll work afternoons. She has soccer practice. - Hello? Oh, hi, Billie. - I'll give you 60% of what I sell. You said you can't retrofit that building till fall, so it's just sitting there empty. - What? - I can do this, Lyle. I need to. - Where was this? Please? - What's this? - Rent. I'm sorry it's not more, but as soon as I find an apartment, I... - You wanna pay me back, set up your studio. Make me one of those fancy doodads. Yes! Excellent, Maddie! Right on! Okay, girls. Bring in the cones! Whoever collects the balls gets an extra star on their chart. Thanks, Judy. Right on. Hey! Did you see Maddie's save? Was that awesome? - It was awesome. - Hey, you wanna grab some dinner at Billie's? - Can we, Mom? - Sorry, we have big plans tonight. - Okay. - Rain check, then. Have fun. - Coach! How about Thursday? - Thursday's great! - What big plans? - You'll see. - This is like my suns- and-stars window. Is this you with your hair short? You look like a boy. - Hey, that was cool back in college. Wanna help me sort the glass? Come on, I know you do. - ♪ Maybe I need you ♪ - Oh hey, perfect timing! You can meet my guys. Guys! - ♪ Here in this world on fire ♪ ♪ Everything moving ♪ ♪ Everyone always tired ♪ ♪ Thinking of futures ♪ ♪ Everything falls away ♪ ♪ Everything changes ♪ ♪ Nothing has changed today ♪ ♪ Maybe I need you ♪ - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Can I try? - No, honey, it's too dangerous. You could get badly burned. See? Look at that. That's a really good one. See? - Then why do you do it? - Because it's beautiful. And difficult. Messing up is easy, and when you do there's no fixing it, but when you manage to get everything just right... Honey, he'll pay it back. - I thought we agreed, no more handouts! - Jo gets free room and board and money for shuffling papers... that's not a handout? - Look, it's your call. But he's never gonna learn if you keep bailing him out. - You can eat here, every meal, and save on groceries. Carpool with Lyle and save on gas. And I'll help you work out a monthly budget, something you can stick to. Okay. You're right. Thanks. - I just got us an apartment! - Are you serious?! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - I thought we agreed you'd stay with me and save up for a down payment. - Congratulations on the apartment. - I'm sorry, but I did get there first. - Don't worry about it. - Whoa! Wedding Central! - Yeah, you wanna help? - I would love to help you, but unfortunately I have a meeting in Kings Landing. But I will steal one of these. - Zoe, the two of you are broke enough as it is; how are you gonna pay the rent? Hello? Hi, Laura. Yeah, I'll be right over. - The idea just hit me and I ran out and bought them... His and Hers. Am I nuts? - No! It's perfect for Tommy and Zoe! Jeez, and I bought them a fondue set. - Oh, Sandy, everybody loves fondue. - Sounds like a big one coming in. I hope the trawler will be okay. - And the ferry. Scott's gone out to Kings Landing and he never drives the Bay Road. You wanna call about the trawler? - No, I... I'll see you later. - Okay. - That was your idea. Just like bungee jumping. - Oh, come on, you loved it. What about Mexico? - How could I forget you water skiing naked? - That was a bikini. - Yeah, not much of one. - What about you and Gus and that damn fish? - Oh, my God, that's right! Do you remember the cantina? God, was that really us? - Is this? What are we doing here, Scott? - I don't know. - Oh God, I don't wanna do this. - Neither do I. - It's crazy, after all these years, to see you again and to still feel like... - I know, it's like no time has passed. - But it has. We're not the same, we can't go back. I don't wanna go back. - No... of course not... - Oh, who am I kidding... I'd love to go back! Ohh... I made a huge mistake, running away from you. If I could just do it all over again... - You think we would have worked? - Probably... for a while. And I wouldn't have my Maddie. You wouldn't have Kevin. - Or Laura. Lyle? - Guess what? - Joanna! Oh, honey... You look exhausted. You're not taking that black cohosh I sent you, are you? - Mom, what are you doing here? - I couldn't miss my goddaughter's wedding, honey. Billie would kill me. Maddie? I know it's been ages since you seen me, so I'm going to make you hug me. Yet. Oh... I couldn't help myself. Oh, it must be something pretty bad to chase you all the way back here. Are you seeing a shrink, honey? - No, Mother. - Good. It's a waste of money. No amount of psychobabble can cure the blues like a good friend's shoulder, a bottle of tequila and a... - Pedicure. - Pedicure, right. - Go ahead. - Can I talk to you? My God, Laura, what? - My dad may have prostate cancer. - What? - They're gonna do a biopsy and a bunch of other tests. We'll know for sure in a week. - We should go... we should be there with him. - No, he doesn't want that. He said, "Now, don't worry until there's something to worry about." Yeah, right. Oh, God, I can't handle this right now... - I'll take care of everything, all right? I love you. - I gotta go get Kevin something to eat. - Hello? - Scott, it's Jo. Did you tell Laura yet? - No. Uh... Her dad may have cancer. I'm sorry. If there's anything I can do... Listen, my mother's here. She might... When we broke up, I went home so depressed I told her everything, including your name. - So what, you think that she's gonna remember? She tends to have amazing recall when it comes to things I wish she'd forget. if you don't wanna risk Laura hearing something, you should probably stay away from here until my mom leaves. Okay? - Okay. - My coach says I'm a great sweeper! - Sweeper? What do you use, a broom? - No, I kick the ball! Don't be crazy, Grandma! Did you hear what Grandma said? So Grandma, why can't you stay longer? - It's roundup season. We've gotta brand the calves, give them their shots, castrate the bullocks. It's our busiest time of the year. That's why I have to leave right after the reception. - I can't imagine you castrating a calf, Mom. - Really? Turns out, honey, it's a lot cleaner than gutting a fish. - Do you ever miss it here? - Honey, I had 30 years up to my eyeballs in chum and nets and debts. I am so done with fish, I can't even eat a river trout. The closest I can get to seafood is a Rocky Mountain Oyster. - Voilà! - Tada! Well? Oh, come on! In China, everybody wears red to a wedding. - Even the bride? - Oh, darling, especially the bride. None of that westernized wussy "virginal white" stuff. It's all about heat and fire and passion. - It's not fair! I've already given up my bathroom, I'm not sleeping on the couch! - Sandy, I'll sleep on the couch. Mom can take the pullout in your den and the girls can sleep in Courtney's room. - What? No! - No, nobody's sleeping on the couch. I've already booked a room at the inn. - No, Carolyn, I can't let you... - Sandy, please. Nobody knows as well as I do how small this house is. - Mom, it's the Prayer Chain. - Hi, Pastor. Oh, no, not Harold again. Another bypass? Okay, I'll pass it on. - Could you give me a ride? So, what does your lawyer say? - I've been advised to gather letters saying what a... good and stable mom I am. Will you write one? - Yeah, but... do you think it'll help? - Don't you? - Honey, in order to prove how good and stable you are, you gotta be good and stable, and you can't do that living here... - I'm looking for an apartment. - Jo... you don't belong here, honey. Really, you never did. I understand coming home till you get things sorted out, but sooner or later... - Are you okay? Hey, are you okay? Hey! - Fran hid her jewellery in a mattress, for God's sake, and he still found it! I swear, right after work I'm getting me a safe like Billie's got down at the diner. - It's not that hard to break into a safe. They got this, like, ultrasound gadget that helps you break the combination. - Yeah? How do you know that, Matthew? - I saw it at Radio Shack. - Isn't it interesting how these burglaries never started until Joanna Johnson got here? Everyone knows she's broke. - Half the town's broke, Charlie. And Jo saw the burglar. She found that jewellery. - So she says. - Her mother was there and saw him, too. - Oh, yeah, and no mom ever lies for her kid, right? - Hallelujah, payday! It goes in the slot above the name. - Oh yeah, sorry. Here, Charlie. - So Joanna, lucky break, you running into the burglar last night. Now you can tell us all what he looks like. - It was dark, I couldn't really see his face. - Interesting. - Going to the wedding? - Yeah. - On the ferry. - Are you going with anyone? - No. Do you wanna go together? - Well, uh... yeah. Yes. - Okay. Hey, sorry I'm late. Laura, I... I heard about your dad. I hope everything's okay. - We'll know in a few days. Until then I'll be working on my bleeding ulcer. - So, can we have pineapple pizza? Dinner? Thursday? Remember? - Honey, I don't think Laura really feels like... - Actually, I could really use a pineapple pizza right now. And a really big glass of wine. We were sick of the city, and we wanted to raise Kevin someplace he could slog through creeks and climb trees and come home with mud in his hair and frogs in his pockets. And then I saw the ad for the P.E. teacher and we visited the town and fell in love. - So Scott's okay practicing small-town law? - I think years ago he had big dreams of saving the world, defending the defenceless... You know, superhero law. But, um... when he was in college his dad died suddenly. There was something wrong with the estate and the will was a mess and his mother couldn't handle it, so he had to drop out and fix everything. He grew up real fast. And then when he got back to school, the experience had changed him. You know, what he does, the bread-and-butter law, it might not be glamorous but, um... it sure makes people's lives a lot easier when their world falls apart. - So, no regrets. - I don't know. I know he loves me. There was this girl in college who broke his heart, and then there was me. he wonders what he's missing. And then there are the rumours. - What, about Scott and that assistant? - About Scott and you. Hey, it's Annabelle all over again... People here love twisting something innocent into a scandal. - Can I tell you something? - Okay. - I've never met a man who loves his wife as much as he loves you. - Thanks. Gee, I must be great company. I'm so scared about my dad that I can't think straight. Nice catch, by the way. - I almost had a floor model. - What happened? - The burglar hit Mrs. Fish. - He hit her? - He robbed her... took her coin collection. He didn't hurt her. - Did anyone get a look at him? - Terence saw some guy speeding on a bike down the road when the sheriff came. Wearing a rain poncho. - He could've had a gun hidden under there. - Or he could just be a guy out for a bike ride. - Don't tell me they've hit poor Louise Fish! - Jo, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. It's just a little close. - Yeah. - Carolyn, these are our neighbours, Laura and Scott Lawton. - Hey there. - Hello, how are you? Nice to meet you. - Hi there, nice to meet you, too. - Lawton... Are you related to Isaiah Lawton over in Kings Landing? - Uh... no. - No? Oh. - Um... Laura, I gotta go help Kevin with some fractions, he's going crazy. - Okay. - Very nice to meet you. - I'm gonna go in and check on poor Louise. - I'm gonna talk to the sheriff. - It's nice how you and Laura hit it off. And Scott too. Nice. Funny that you went to the same school and you didn't know each other. - Boston U is larger than Camden Bay, Sandy. There are thousands of students there. - Everyone sleeps in the same dorms and apartments, drinks in the same pubs. Maybe you had some of the same friends. - If you have something to say, just say it. - Don't lie to me. I've opened my home to you. I defend you when people talk. If you've got some good reason for hiding something, fine. Just don't lie to me. Mom, come on! - I'll be right there. - Hey! That's for the caterers! Ah! God! - Billie? What happened? - Damn burglar cleaned out the safe! Now how am I going to pay the caterer? - Oh, Billie... - Carolyn! He took everything! - Oh, shh... - And he hit my baby! - Oh, Billie! Shh, shh... - She's got a shiner coming up like an 8-ball! On her wedding day! - Oh, honey, we'll fix it. Laura, you know Charlie Crane? - Little man, big mouth? - Bingo. Tell him what's happened here, make sure you let him know that all the money's gone, and beg him not to let anybody else know. Charlie... - Oh! ♪ - Matthew Silva. You look very handsome. - What happened to your cheek? - I was attacked by a reluctant rosebush. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? Please join me in welcoming Mr. and Mrs. Tommy Palchek! - Yeah, Zoe! You're gorgeous, girl! - Nobody messes with our Zoe! - Kiss her, Tommy! - You're a man of hidden talents. - Not hidden. Just quiet. - Can you teach me? - Sure. Just get some more paper. - Come with me. - That boy still has a crush on you. - We're just old friends, Mom. - Dad? Hey, what's going on? Any news? Yep. Great. Yeah. I'm at the wedding. Okay, I'll call you later. Love you too. - We got paper for everyone. Coach Laura! Come and see! - Psst, hey! I just talked to my dad. He's okay, no cancer. I'm so glad. - So, this is the Arts and Crafts table? - You're not just a neighbour, you're Maddie's coach, too! Oh! - Not only that: Jo went to school with Scott. - We just had one class together. - Still, some coincidence. - Laura, I was gonna go to the gift table. Wanna come with me? - Thanks, but I'm gonna stay here, I think, and make a paper crane... or a brontosaurus... or maybe just a rutabaga. I'm not very good at this. How do you do it? - Oh, my God! - So you came with Matthew Silva. - To give people something harmless to talk about. You can't be jealous. - I know. I can't. - Jo, would you like to dance? - Sure. - So, your husband's a lawyer? - Yes, but don't hold that against him. - And he graduated from Boston U? - UMass, actually. He dropped out of Boston U after his father died. - Look what Aunt Sandy gave me. - Wow! That is some fancy purse. - Look at all the stuff it can hold. Want to see pictures of Mom in college? - Oh now, darling, don't go showing embarrassing pictures of Mom without her permission. - Look at Mom with short hair. She's standing with a funny guy and a surfboard. - ♪ I'm off to places I've never been ♪ ♪ To see faces I've never seen ♪ ♪ Baby, this restless heart is gone ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm the rebel kind ♪ ♪ I wanna be just like James Dean ♪ ♪ Yeah I'm the rebel kind ♪ ♪ And baby I'm just living out my dream ♪ - Can we go? Can we go? Now? - Did I do something wrong? - You look tired, Jo. Not sleeping well? Guilty conscience will do that to you. - I should've known. Stop spreading rumours about me. - All I know is where there's smoke there's fire... and fires can't help but spread. - This is none of your business. - No? We've had a crime spree around here since you showed up. People are losing their savings, their valuables. Nobody feels safe anymore... that's my business. It's everyone's business. - Wait... you think I'm the burglar? - You're broke, you know this town inside and out, and you live with a damn watch captain who knows everyone's secrets. Everybody here knows everybody's secrets! - You okay? What happened? - Why the hell did I come here? What was I thinking? These people will never change. They'll never let me change. - Laura. - Laura, it's not what you... - Let's go. - What about Dad? - Let's go, honey. - Maddie... - Sandy will look after her. Come on. - What's going on? - She's the girl! She's the one! - Yes. I just... I thought that if I could keep the past... if it stayed in the past, it would be better for everyone. - But it didn't! It's next door! And it's not the past anymore, is it? You think I didn't hear the gossip? I chose to ignore it because I wanted to believe you. I wanted to think it was like that thing with Annabelle. Now... I can't help but think that was a lie too! - It wasn't a lie. That's... - No, don't! Please, don't! Don't! Just... just get out. Get out. Get out. - I remember when you came home from school so depressed. It was a shock to have you home, but then bawling about some guy who it was your choice to leave anyway... That was Scott? Aw, you should have told me, sweetie. I would have kept your secret. All right, maybe not. But I would have tried to help. - I'm not having an affair with him, Mom. - Are you sure? Sometimes a secret can seem an awful lot like an affair. Trust me, I know. - Did you see the way she looked at me? - Laura? - Maddie. Laura, too... Jeez... I just wanted a safe place for her while I figured out... I mean, I just thought, What could be better than Lyle and Sandy's? I just hate that my daughter thinks I'm a screwup. You were such a rock for me. - Why? Because I stayed put in that hell of a marriage? The only reason I stayed was because I didn't have the guts to get out. But sweetie, you always had guts to spare. Whatever you wanted to do, no matter how difficult it was, no matter how unpopular, you went ahead and did it. At least you used to. - What's that supposed to mean? - Well... There's this heifer... she's about ten times bigger than me, but if I start to shout or swagger about, she runs for her life. - Peter is not just swaggering and shouting, Mom. I mean, he's already taken away my marriage, my home, my lifestyle... - I know that, I know. And you're wise to take him seriously, and I will write that letter. But that's not the point, though, is it? I mean, you can't stay here. So you've got a choice: you can come to the ranch for the summer, you and Maddie, or you can go back to where your friends are, where her friends are, get yourself whatever kind of job you can, get your stuff out of storage, furnish your tiny little apartment and just get on with your life. Sweetie, that's the only way you're going to keep Maddie. And I'm not talking about custody, either. - Where have you been? - I took Mom to the airport. She says she'll call when she gets home. - "Don't lie to me." That's all I asked, and that's exactly what you did. - I'm sorry, and I'll explain, but right now I'm beat, so I'm just gonna take Maddie and we're gonna sleep at the warehouse. - The warehouse? I'm not letting you sleep in some rat-infested warehouse. - It's not rat-infested. Let's go. - No. - Honey, don't argue. Let's go. - No! - She can stay. Would you like to stay here, sweetie? - Sandy, don't. - You wanted a safe, stable environment for her. This is it. This is why you came here. Why would you take her away from it when you have nothing better to offer? - Come on, Maddie. Maddie! Maddie! - Jo? Jo. You okay? - What are you doing here? - Laura kicked me out. - Oh, God. I'm so sorry. - I was, um... hoping that maybe you could talk to her. - Me? - Yeah, well, she won't listen to me at all right now. And you guys, you hit it off so well, you might have better luck. - That was before I became the friend who screwed her husband. - We never did... - It doesn't matter! Everybody says we did, everybody knows we did, so we did! - Where's Maddie? - She's with Sandy. She wouldn't come with me. - Know what we need right now? - Witnesses. Yeah. - Laura. I don't blame you for being angry, but if you could just listen... I wanted to tell you, but I promised Scott that I'd let him do it. Would you just stop for a minute, please? Will you really end your marriage over a bunch of lies? - You wanna talk lies? Every moment that we shared together that you didn't come clean, Jo, was a lie. Why should I believe you now? - Because I have nothing to lose! That first night, if I'd told you that we'd been lovers in college, would you have taken Maddie under your wing like you did? Would you have wanted to be my friend? - That's no excuse. - You're right. - Are you in love with him? - I was crazy about him in college. When his dad died, he asked me to go with him, to stay with him, and I'd only known him a few months and... - Are you in love with him? - Completely honest, okay? I was always glad to see him. I loved it when we talked. It was exciting, and sweet, and maybe it was a kind of affair. Oh, come on, haven't you ever had that with someone? - No! - Laura, don't do this! We didn't sleep together! We could have, but we didn't... because he's so crazy about you! - What are you doing here? - I forgot my shawl. What are you doing here? - Cleaning up. Chairman of the Fisherman's Association, part of my job. - Charlie? Jeez. Well, I guess if there's anyone who knows where to find anything in this town, it's probably him. - Just tell the sheriff you found those where his truck was parked. It'll be enough for a warrant, and then I'm sure they'll find more. But do it now, before he's long gone. - Okay, I don't get it. Why me? - Well, if I say Charlie's the burglar, it'll just look like I'm trying to get him back for accusing me. Besides, after last night, no one's gonna believe anything I say. - Yeah, that's for damn sure. Although nobody puts much stock in me, either, you know. I'm just Sandy's flaky little brother. - Well, you won't be anymore if you help catch the burglar. Hey, Dad, it's me! Hey, Dad. - Hey, bud. - What smells? - I hope it's the Brie, not me. What are you doing here? - The game? Remember? - Yeah, yeah. I got the tickets right here, I just... I thought we... - Kevin, honey, do you have spending money? - Dad still owes me ten bucks from our last game. - I'm sure he'll pay up. Here's a change of clothes and a slicker. They said it might rain. - I am so sorr... - You better hurry. You might miss the game. We'll talk at home. - Dad, hurry, we're gonna be late for the game! Dad... - Hey, guys. I wanna take Maddie for the afternoon. I'll have her home for dinner, okay? - Thought we were getting ice cream. - We will. - I didn't bring a book. - Good. Come here. I remember when I was making it, I thought, "She'll wake up to coloured light for years and years and years." I'm not sure where we'll be from now on. But we'll be okay. I think you need some coloured light to take with you, to hang in your window wherever you are. I don't have everything we need for a casting, but I thought we could make something new. You know, make something together. Okay? All right, put these on. I've got mine. Very cool. All right, I'm gonna turn this on... Remember: you can't get anywhere near it, all right? It's very, very, very hot. Pick a colour, okay? - We had deputies checking out his locker, the trawler, the Fisherman's Hall... Charlie took off in such a hurry he left stuff stashed all over the place. They found a stack of mail from some sports fishing outfit in the Bahamas. Guess he was working on his own retirement plan. - Did Martha know? - Evidently not. She's damn angry, too. Not that Charlie was the burglar, but that she was the last to know. - Hopefully the police will catch him before she does. - You know the craziest thing? Nathan is the hero. How that halfwit figured it out... He even gets a reward. - Great. Now he can pay back what he owes you. - Pff! You want odds on that? - Here's the key to the warehouse. And here's your doodad. - Um... This is the custody letter. And this is the job reference. I elevated you to office manager and chief supply clerk. - Thanks. For everything. Matt, I'm sorry about our... date. - It's okay. I kinda thought it was too good to be true. - You're a great guy. I know it's hard to leave home, but in a different town... This place labelled us both a long time ago. No matter what we do, I'll always be That Damn Johnson Girl and you'll be... - Most Likely to Blend into the Wallpaper? - Take care. Did you have fun on your last day of school? - I made cookies. Do you want to come in? - No, thanks. I just came to say goodbye. - You're leaving. - You've been so generous. I'm sorry I lied to you and embarrassed you. I'm so glad that Maddie has an aunt who loves her enough to make all the sacrifices you're willing to make for her. We're both lucky to have you in our lives. You're ready to go? - What? Wait a minute. - Please, Maddie, let's just get in the car. - Joanna... - No, Sandy. Your home is wonderful, but it's not her home. I'm her home. And even if things are rough right now, she's my daughter and she belongs with me. - Of course she does. And I'm sure, in time, that will happen. But right now, I think it's important that you just quietly... - Mom! Bye, Aunt Sandy. Love you. After 40 years of knowing someone... And I mean knowing... - Martha, I'm eating. - To find out he's been lying all along! A lying, deceiving snake in the grass! - Yeah, I'll tell her! Bye! - But I have to admit, deep down inside, I always felt something was a little... off. - Joanna Johnson just left town. I'm not sorry, between the reception and sneaking around with Scott... Though it looks like Laura believed her. - Laura's a fool. - Oh, Martha. - Don't "Oh, Martha" me. Anyone with half a brain could see... Carlene!
