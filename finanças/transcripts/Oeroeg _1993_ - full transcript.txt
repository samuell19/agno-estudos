Miss... ...It would be most disconcerting ... Have a good voyage. Fire! Wrong ! Private Trash Head ! My name is Antoine Mortier, major ! Look ! Antoine Trash head ! That's the way you get yourself killed by those brown assholes. You enter a shack, some rice-eater is by the door... So what happens? So how should you do it? They're next to the door, so what do you do first? So, he won't be calling “Merdeka” any more. "Merdeka", sergeant major You placed the wrong emphasis. The time has come finally, gentlemen. We're on our way to Indonesia. These days and weeks we will be exposed to continuous new impressions and experiences Yet you should stop and think why you are making this journey. Why you and I are heading for the tropics as soldiers The farmers son from Wolvega. The butcher's boy from Rotterdam. The student from Utrecht. A cross section of our people and all their lives Several months ago we came together. Civilians from all walks of life who reported to the barracks. In the short time we have spent in transit barracks... ...the first necessary changes in our lives have taken place. Thank you Ape , Nut , Mies and now Teun. 'Teun' - T..., E-... ♪ where does love comes from, the eyes to the heart ♪ 'Rasa sayang e, rasa sayang sayang e' ♪ 'Oh that girl is so far away' 'Rasa sayang sayang e' Can you see anything? I can't see anything at all. It can't be a water spirit. You can't see them. If you can't see it, how do you know it's the water spirit? Sushhhhh, You can't talk about spirits like that Soon Neneh Kombel will get angry. Oeroeg? I'm afraid. Johan Don't do that, ! Neneh Kombel will get mad. I saw it. I saw it! I saw her ! I saw Neneh Kombel , I' ve seen Neneh Kombel That's impossible. Neneh Kombel is a woman. An old ugly woman She lives in the trees. But I did saw her, she has a beard. Let's go home now Johan! Johan Johan.....Oeroeg ! Johan Johan ! Papa Over there Look there , they're over there Go quick, get them Don't talk voodoo nonsense, Deppoh. Go get those kids You stay in your room all day tomorrow, understood!? Don't set a foot outside! And I don't want you to be with that kampung boy He has a bad influence on you. But papa. I don't want to hear another word. Don't play with the son of Mr. ten Berghe anymore. Also don't go to that big house You get strange ideas there Yes, father, but... I don't want to hear another word. J_A_A_P and that is? Jaap Very good! And? - G-IJ-S And that is? - GIJS Good, and then? DIEN Yes very good If you take the J from JAAP, Which word do you get JAAP... AAP Very Good. Write that down. If you remove the G off GIJS, What do you get.....JOHAN What was that ? (whispering) Near or far, we'll always be brothers.' Johan, what are you doing?

I'm looking at the moon, dad moon hmm, very good Go to sleep. Good night Lieutenant, How did you know about Mer... Merdeka. MERDEKA ? I was born there. - Really? Yeah I wonder what it will be like. Yup The most beautiful country in the world Nice people , the best food all sorts of fruit, satays (meat skewers) Pisang goreng, Pisang what? It's fried banana. - They eat that? You will too, just wait. It won't be easy, because you don't get to enjoy the best... ..of that beautiful country. What you get to see is not always the most beautiful , the best You will understand why you have to go to Indonesia There was once an establishment here... A solid establishment of justice, peace and order Because the Japanese invasion and the bad stewardship by the same people ...radically destroyed this establishment Police! Watch out, snipers! There! Where ? Merdeka! "Most beautiful country in the world!" Fried banana! Pisang goreng! Good, I hope we've arranged everything. And I wish you success. Thank you Bye, bye , bye Lida! Johan Hello. A lot has happened. Eight years is a long time. How long have you been out... ...of the concentration camp? I was never in a camp. I thought the Japs interned everyone. I kept out of their hands. I went into hiding. You look wonderful. I'm looking for father. Yes, he was here. Come with me. Ah .. Good morning, Miss Banning. The very man I was looking for. This is Johan ten Berghe. He was in Struiswijk Camp with your father. You're his son! My name is Van Amerongen, remember me? Uncle Chris! Come to our room. It will do Valerie good to see you. Please come. The Japs broke all of us, Johan. Your father has done what we can't. He has left for Batavia. Where about? We don't know. Probably back... What? To the plantation? To Kebon Jati? But that's much too dangerous! They say it's enemy territory. The TNI is in control. Your father said , as soon as we are free I'll go to Kebon Jati It was remarkable, recently he talked a lot about you. Valerie, look who's here. Johan... Hendrik's son! Why did you come back? Valerie, you can see... No, not just that... I wanted to see the East Indies again. This place? - Valerie, please First the Japs, then the extremists with their Red & White! They want to get rid of us! She's confused. Because of the camp and this here... Where are we going? - Kebon Jati. Kebon Jati? - My father's there. The lieutenant has leave? The lieutenant has taken leave. Stop here. Listen Antoine I'll go on alone now. - Listen... If they ask where I am... I had to meet my father - I'm coming with you lieutenant. I can't ask you that... I mean ehhh Actually we are not supposed to go any further We're a team. I'm your driver, aren't I? Antoine, just stay here. I'll go along the edge of the river going up there Cover me from here. It's possible, Look... Hey, that's... That's the house on the photo! Yes, that's Kebon Jati If I'm not back in an hour, just head back. I can't do that! - Mortier! Do as you're told! OK Hey ! Pisang goreng!. - Pisang goreng. Halt! Hands up... Hands up Hurry! Hold that Sten at your head That way... Oeroeg? Father!! FATHER ! Johan! Nothing! Long live The Queen! Hooray, hooray, hooray! Deppoh! Do you like it? It suits you perfectly As good as new. You couldn't afford that in a lifetime. You're right, Mr Ten Berghe. You can go home. Today is a feast for you too. Thank you, sir. Look, look! Can it walk over razorblades? ...equalised a little. No car can survive otherwise. Nothing to be done I'm sorry. It'll take a week to get it repaired. What are you doing with the tea? Or are you switching to quinine also? Valerie! - Thank you. No, auction prices for tea are fine. Cheers to The Queen! - The Queen! Why should I produce quinine? Excuse me... I say, Hendrik... Lida is a smart lady. When did she come to the Indies? - A few years ago. She runs Pension des Indes. She teaches Johan twice a week. Look Oeroeg what a big one! That can fight! Put it down. - No, not with the slug! And this frog, what about that? Just put it here. Look out, he's gone - He can't do that??? Ouch! It pecks so creepy ! Johan, don't get yourself dirty. Oeroeg go home. Miss Banning.. If Johan asks about his mother... ...then say she's ill... in Holland. You're the best dancer, Johan! Your son is a nice kid. Everybody! Let's go swimming. Where is Deppoh? Ali, Ali - Yes, master. Call Depoh yes Sir Lay out some towels. Yes sir Bring the car to the front. Get food and drinks ready, Ali! Come swimming with us! Brilliant idea! But the lake is bewitched by Neneh Kombel daddy! Stop talking nonsense Johan But Oeroeg says all kinds of spirits live there. Ask Deppoh! Deppoh! Deppoh! Deppoh! Behave yourself, Johan. Please You dance very well, Miss Banning. Neneh Kombel! Wrong it was a giant bat Little boys should be in bed. It's very slippery. Valerie... ls it far? Chris, show us how long you can stay under water this time? Hold on Valerie! There he goes. I wouldn't do it. - Wait... wait... One, two, Go .....Five.... - Is your watch running? Watch your words, Verbeek! This valuable piece, was a personal gift from the Regent of Sumedang, Raden Adipati Surya Kusuma Adinata. To my grandfather Jan, It's a family heirloom. There must be a spirit here to be able to keep your breath for such a long time. There is nothing , mr Johan There is only water plants If we dive in too deep... we can get tangled in the weeds... ...and drown. So there is no water-spirit? Neneh Kombel!!!! Johan, behave yourself! Johan!! No! No! Papa come back! Calm down, child. Calm down. Come on then... Calm down, Johan. Have a sip of water. Calm, yes... calm down... I'm glad you came. He has been three days like this. Boy, you have a temperature. Come on... Why is Oeroeg crying, Papa? What happened? Consider it a bad dream... ...with a happy ending for you. Deppoh... Where's Deppoh? Deppoh rescued you from the water. Deppoh saved your life. Did you know that? But where's he now? Deppoh is... Deppoh is dead! Deppoh mati!! Neneh Kombel did it! Stop this Neneh Kombel nonsense. Please You are Dutch , There's no Neneh Kombel. Deppoh got tangled in the weeds. It's no one's fault, Johan. Yes it is ! it's my fault ! Nonsense! It's no one's fault. Deppoh... Deppoh is a hero, Deppoh is a hero! Listen, Johan... Oeroeg! Oeroeg! Oeroeg came to say goodbye. He's moving back to Darsala. Since his father is gone, We need the house for another foreman. Say goodbye to Oeroeg. - Please, Johan! Johan, calm down! Calm down, calm down Here, have a sip of water. Very good... Damn it! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you can stay at Kebon Jati. You can live with the servants. Forgive us, Dutch master, that we rebelled. And remember: the simple Javanese beg us to restore order. In that light we should see That Hendricus Ten Berghe made the ultimate sacrifice Dust to dust, ashes to ashes... Why didn't you stop him? You know your father. If I'd been 30 minutes earlier, he'd still be alive. Near Kebon Jati I was threatened by his suspected killer. He aimed at me and I saw his eyes and part of his face. I'm almost sure it was Oeroeg. Oeroeg loved your father. No, he loved you. I was thinking... ...maybe you know where he is? He must be here somewhere. I saw him. I don't know where to look, Johan. Lida, I must find him. I haven't heard from him since the Japs came I've heard he is in East Java Dear Johan, when you were in Holland... ...things changed here. It's less simple. Lieutenant Ten Berghe! I'm thinking how to save you from a court marshal? As far as I'm concerned, they can sentence you right away. I thought that... I thought my father's life was in danger. I understand that, lieutenant. I think I can find his killer. We have police for that work, we are not here to catch murderers, Even if he's with the TNI? Tell me more. He might be able to help us. If you can find him. I'll find him. I mean... alive! He's no use to us dead. I understand that, major. You realise too that I have to send a complete report to headquarters. Then it's up to Colonel Van Daalen what he decides to do with it. Too bad We're abandoning a trail and... ...he may pick it up.. ...and take the credit. Nice for the colonel... You speak the local language, don't you? That's right. Good. But only you report back to me. I must be able to do it my way. No, thanks. You will do it, even if I forbid you. I don't want you to go alone. Take an experienced NCO with you. If you insist. - I do insist. Can I have some coffee? Dammit , that thing's much too high! It's also freezing. What am I doing here!? Hey tin can... I also wouldn't stand in the toilet and piss on the floor in your home! It isn't a bath, it's a mandi bak, okay? And hurry up. There's work to do. I'm coming. Mandi...?? Good morning, lieutenant Good morning sir He is back Two men there and two there. Make sure I'm not interrupted. If you want to know what I think... We do it my way, sergeant major Agreed? One each side and one straight in - Everyone thinks you're crazy Johan. Are they right? Maybe. Is this for the army or for your father? It's for you, Antoine Next to those huts Mortier Turn that jeep! Is that chocolate? - No. Do you read me? Hey kids. get lost Off the jeep quick What do you want here?! Satih? Sinyo Johan. Who are you carrying there? Your child? Is it a boy? What's his name? Deppoh. Sinyo Johan, it is dangerous for you to come here. Dangerous for you and for us There's no one can be trusted anymore around here, Sinyo. You can trust me, Satih. I trust you. But some people around here... don't want to see the Dutch any more. They might think anything. You're a Dutch soldier now. They could draw their own conclusion. What's up with your mother? She has malaria. But the neighbours have given her a herbal remedy Mum, Sinyo Johan is here. Sinyo has grown! How are you, Sinyo? - Is Oeroeg here? We don't know where Oeroeg is. Has he joined the TNI? Don't ask me that. I don't know. Does he know that his mother is very ill? You can have this picture of him. Thank you, Ibu... Has he changed much... ..in all these years? Why are you asking about him? Has he done anything wrong? I'd better leave now. Satih! I have to talk to Oeroeg He is not here If he's here he will only visit father's grave. It was no one's fault. It was an accident! You may have different recollection from ours. Lieutenant! Radio report from HQ! A large TNI column is approaching. They just crossed the Mandiri creek. Bruinsma, Bren on the last vehicle. Kretek, cover them. Are they still far? A few miles south, they say. Great. - Great?? There's nothing great here! Where's that damn pelopor we want? He wasn't there. Bruinsma, take cover. Let's take some other blue apes! Sergeant major I have no protection, get in, get in! You didn't succeed. He's here somewhere. Are you sure it was him? I will be, if I find him. Can I ask you something? Not about that nurse again! How do you say in Malaysian, "Rita, you have the loveliest eyes I ever saw?" Brake, Antoine Brake! Duck! Pelopors! Take cover! By the trees. Where? What happened to him? Antoine ? Have mercy, sir. Why are you fighting? How many of you are there? You'd better tell me everything. Who is your commander? The name of your division? Tell me! Is that all? - He's well trained. Where's your command post? That damn poisonous propaganda station? Does he speak Dutch? Yes, but he won't. It's the "language of white men". You can go lieutenant. You look exhausted. Anything else, major? No thanks. Take some rest. Is there someone called Oeroeg with your company? What did you ask him? What I asked him before. I really feel that someone should look at his wound. ♪ Join the army, rape a servant... ♪ By the men on duty ♪ and the lieutenant stood guard, right? Come on guys. We will sing at the piano, oh come on. Antoine, are you awake? Can you hear me? It'll be all right. We're just waiting for transport so we can get you to Batavia. They can help you there. Do you have pain? Help him! - I am. I'm no surgeon. l'm a nurse. I have done what I can. Can you give him an injection? We have no more morphine. R-i-t-a... beau-ti-ful eyes... What did he say? He says your eyes are like the sun, Miss Rita. Tell me everything that you know The name of your commander, the name of your outpost. And I will make sure you are safe untill everything blows over. I'm listening! You don't want to talk? You want to be a hero? Will he live? - I don't know. And the other wounded, will they live? Is he a friend of yours? Yes Antoine is my friend. Now you think it's your fault? You shouldn't be here. Actually you aren't really a soldier. Goodnight. And ? Nothing? Stop this right away! It's none of your business, lieutenant Don't worry. We're just obeying orders. He's a POW (prisoner of war) He's a pelopor who almost killed your driver in a cowardly ambush. Damn it, whose side are you on? Untie him! You really want us to let him go? Right away. Let go! Thank you men. I have to report this. The major won't be happy. He wanted us to get the prisoner to talk. And you order us to kill him. I hope you hang for this! I just obeyed your order, lieutenant ♪ William of Nassau, we are of German blood ♫ I trust in my fatherland till death ♪ A prince of Orange ♪ I am free and brave ♪ the King of Spain ♪ I have always honoured Boys, do you still remember where the Rhine enters our country? At Lobith, sir! - Very good! Here. Look, that's the Rhine. No, that's the Mandiri! Ow really? Groningen, Hoogezand, Sappemeer, Zuidbroek, Heiligerlee, Nieuweschans, Roodeschool... I'll fly over them all in the future. Look, papa. My report. Enter nicely using the stairs Johan. One mark of 7.5, Very good! Very good, Johan. Oeroeg has a report too. I'll sign it too then. Ten for arithmetic, Oeroeg?! That's not bad, that's not bad at all! You can be bookkeeper when Johan takes over the plantation. But Oeroeg and I want to be explorers or pilot. Blow! - One, two, three. Very good... You know, as far as the eye can see,boy... ...it wil all belong to you later. How beautiful, Oeroeg. Did you make it yourself? Very good. Congratulations. There you are. - Thank you. Shall I show you. Look. Hi, Johan! Your birthday guests, Johan. But I didn't invite them! Be a good host, come on! Congratulations! - Happy Birthday. It's time for him to mix with ordinary boys... ...stop hanging around in the kampong with Oeroeg. Have you seen the kampong? Well, keep it that way! This is for you. Soldiers of Holland. Don't you wish you were back home in Purmerend? With your family, your wife, your fiancee With your girl... But now you're thousands of miles from home. Your government misled you! You suffered German oppression. What does your government want? You have to oppress a people that wants freedom... The same freedom you craved for five years. You know this radio station is prohibited! They play such good music! Next time, you'll be charged! Understood? And you'll be the first, Deelstra! Wait a minute soldier. Antoine, be good! I'll come and see you OK ? Fried banana! Can you hear me? I won't hurt you. I need your help. This is personal. This man is an old friend. His name is Oeroeg. He used to live in Kampong Darsalah... Is this the right time to interrogate someone? Did he tell you anything? What about soldier Mortier? Maybe they can save him. I don't know. - Rita... I had nothing to do with this. It was an accident, believe me. Of course. This suits you better, Ten Berghe. Than what, major? Intelligence work. You're not very clever, are you? Col. van Daalen just told me you sent a confidential report... ...on the prisoner straight to HQ. That's right. He said you asked for an inquiry into maltreatment of the POW Maybe I can help you. What do you want? War is no excuse for lawlessness. Shall we leave it at that? We're fighting murderers, rapists, thugs! And you talk about justice? You're a bigger fool than I thought! Or are you remorseful, because you almost killed your driver? Sergeant Major, may I? I think you're hiding something, lieutenant. What do you really want? Do you want to go home? Major, this is my home. Home is where you're loved... And who loves you here? Hi Oeroeg! Want to join in? - Yes Yes, a real ball boy! Hey, hit it to me too! Fetch that ball! Hurry up! Hey you! You have bananas in your ears? Quick! What's the matter with your servant? Come here, you! He's getting away! After him! He is going that way Good morning ladies. A letter for Mrs. Rooskens. Would you like more tea? Good morning Mr. van Blankestein. Here's your long-awaited letter. Paskil, tea. And this was for you. Here you are. Johan! Shouldn't you be at school? Miss Lida? ls Oeroeg less than us? What happened? Oeroeg ran away from Kebon Jati. Where did he go? Of course Oeroeg isn't less than us. Is a crocodile less than an elephant? A butterfly less than a giraffe? No. They are different. Oeroeg is your friend. That's all that counts. That's a new person . There's Oeroeg. Oeroeg! Oeroeg, you can't ditch school. Come with me. What did he say? - He said: 'I'm no longer at school. I'm a farmer now.' Hold this. It's important that you learn, Oeroeg. That you can read and write and do arithmetic. Why? - For the future. What is 'future'? Future is that when you grow up... ...you can do anything you like. Anything? Pilot, admiral, doctor... - Admiral! Or be boss of the tea plantation! No, I'll be boss of Kebon Jati. Listen. Johan's father is going to Europe soon. Johan will live with me too. - Great! What do you think of that? You never wear that any more. I'm no muslim. That tie... no good. Papa wants me to move back to Kebon Jati after all these years That's better. What about me? Of course I won't go. I want to stay here. I'm a city boy now! Just like me. What's his new wife like? Let's not talk about it. Perfect. - Really? Keep it, it's an old one anyway. - Thanks. Hello, I'm Johan. This is Karin and this is Annelies. Hello. Would you like a cigarette or...? Good evening. Damn it! Lida's coming! The liquor, quick!! Hurry! Give me some money! But surely they aren't...? Just give it, now! Hurry up and get lost! Jacket! Wait, wait! Going out again? Yes?! ♪ 'Look at the sparkle in my eyes' ♪ 'Look at my dimpled chin' Boys, really! ♪ 'Don't be so silly!' ♪ 'Give us a smile. You look cross as a spider.' You both have exams tomorrow!

I want to buy three. No, sir. They're for the hospital. Oh okay, thanks anyway. Any news of Antoine Mortier? Not that I know of. You're working late. What are you doing? We make juice from it. No smoking here. We used to draw faces on them. When my friend Antoine Mortier was here... ...there was no morphine. But that sniper did get morphine, didn't he? I... found an ampule somewhere. It was in there, I suppose? How long have you worked for the TNI? I'm a nurse! But on which side? Sorry , if you want to report me, go ahead Or do you prefer to hang me on a tree Who is that? That's my blood-brother. I think he killed my father. Now you want to kill him? - No... I only want to know what happened. I have to find him. You have contacts on the other side. Is that an order, lieutenant? No! But you have no choice. At ease. Sit down, gentlemen. I read your report with interest... ...and those by the major and sergeant major Appointing a complete commission to investigate... ...strike me as being too much of a good thing. And as the responsible officer I find it quite displeasing ...to see my subordinates squabbling in public Especially when one of them, the young lieutenant... ...seems to be rather confused... ...by the tragic death of his father. It looks like this is a case of... ...an ambiguous order by you... ...and an unambiguous interpretation by the sergeant major That is quite common in times of war. I'll leave it at that. As far as you're concerned Ten Berghe... I think your considerable talents... ...would be better used at some training centers in Apeldoorn So you will return to Holland on the next boat. Your new appointment also involves... ...automatic promotion to first lieutenant Do I have any say in the matter? I'm afraid not. It's an enviable position... Oh yes... That wingman of yours... Antoine Mortier... -Yes... I'm afraid he died last night. Will you visit his parents in Holland? Platoon 2, hut 5! Get out! All report to the quartermaster. Good evening... - Good evening. What is it? - I have to help you, sir. Who said so? Miss Rita said you needed help. Wait here. "There is much to talk about." "Come to Telaga Hideung tomorrow." "You know where!" "You will hear more there." You know where, there you'll hear more "You're safe, on our word as blood brothers. Oeroeg." Architecture? But that means going back to Holland, doesn't it? I'm going to study medicine. They use too much magic, voodoo and herb medicine around here. I'm going to improve matters. They're probably afraid I'll cut them open. Why? They trust you. You're one of them aren't you? Will you work for the government? I want to leave here. For Holland? America. To get rich! Everyone is equal there. Abdullah, how are you? - I'm fine. And you? Fine too. I have an exam tomorrow . Can we have two chicken satay? Tell your friend, I don't understand Dutch. Don't act crazy! - You're crazy! You're the one who is crazy Two chicken satay, okay?! Are you deaf?! - Never mind. We'll get some elsewhere. You're the one who is blind! Go powder yourself white! Thank you. The man at the box office said... ...that my friend could come in for once. No, only Europeans. - I know, but... ...that there were exceptions. No, no sir. Thank you. - Not even with...? Okay. Okay next time maybe. It didn't work. Then we can take that entrance. I don't really feel like going. Sir, you must go that way. -Yes, I know. Stupid Tarzan, "Me Tarzan, you Jane" If he learnt English with the apes, why not learn Dutch? ...or Malay. - Yes, or Malay. You go on your own - Then I won't go either. No, I'll go buy some paper and some pens. I'll meet you later. We can have a beer at Tojo's. Hurry up, it'll be sold out. - Okay. See you later. Soldiers of Holland, awake! It's not too late to lay down your arms. Don't be misled. ...misused by powers in The Hague, who only want conquest... ...where there's nothing to conquer... ...because our Republic of Indonesia is a fact. ...Indonesia Merdeka!!!! "Our Republic of Indonesia"?! Are you surprised, Johan? "Our Republic of Indonesia"?! Are you surprised, Johan? How is it possible. You were the picture of innocence at father's funeral, while... Innocence? Or guilty, but what am I guilty of...? I should have known. When you said you could hide... Where is Oeroeg? What do you want of him? - He should be here. Let's make a deal first. Let's swap information. Johan, when will your offensive start? I don't know. -You're an officer! You did intelligence work! Lida, that was a special mission. I'm just an engineer. Anyway, in a few days I will head back to Holland. Untie him. Sit down... Cigarette? You'd much rather stay here. I belong here in the Indies. Since 17 August 1945 this is no longer the "Indies"... ...but the Republic of Indonesia. - Yes... Led by collaborators... You have to take sides, Johan! Not everyone take the same side as you. What will you do? Lida, I don't have any information. I wouldn't tell you anyway. I'm no traitor. I just want to know where Oeroeg is. It's a pity. Take him outside. We can't let you go, of course. You are now in the hands of the army of Republic of Indonesia. May god protect you, Johan. hurry up, hurry up, hurry up forward Stop it, men. Come on, let's go. We're pulling out! Johan ? Experience has taught me that many fellow natives... ...are infected with an aggressive virus... ...and now suffer eye disease a disease preventing them see what is happening around them. and still happening Every day!! A fatal disease resulting in bad eye-hand coordination... ...and limiting flexing of the fingers... Resulting to one position of the hand This one! Indonesia merdeka! While we all know that training these flexors... ...makes the fingers able to curl completely! Beautiful speech. Thank you. Congratulations. A school diploma opens the doors to the world... for some! Hello Johan. We haven't seen you for a long time. I leave by boat tomorrow. I came to say goodbye. You'll miss Oeroeg's speech at the university. What a pity. She speaks good Malaysian now and she is learning Javanese. To help Oeroeg working among the people. You want to join government service? No government job. I don't need your help any more. You hold up your hand to Lida. Lida thinks the way we do. One of the few. 'The Rhine enters Holland at Lobith.' But the Ciliwung has its source at Gunung Gde spring. That we didn't learn! 'If you can sing, sing along'. That's what the government wants. Let every bird sings its own song. 'William of Nassau' 'Indonesian blood run in my veins' 'Loyal to Sukarno' 'We are until death' But when our people want to sing of this freedom... ...they were arrested and exiled. We have been exploited for centuries. The government humiliated and underpaid the people. It's not that bad, Oeroeg, is it? Look at your father. He was a foreman. How dare you mention my father! Can we change the... - No... I have no secrets for my friends. They can hear it all. I still don't understand why suddenly everything has changed between us? Hah suddenly?? You'll never understand, Johan! What do you mean? God, we were soo "happy" with your discarded clothes ! "Too small, too big, hardly worn, just like new." Why did I never gave you my clothes when they were too small !? I'm not getting you... Who's not able to go to Holland to study? Who can't watch Tarzan on a normal screen?? I apologised a thousand times. Forgive me that! Forgive and forget! Like with my father? No Johan, not any more. Your father has nothing to do with this. He has everything to do with this! You're father should be dead, not mine! You killed my father! But he saved my life! Without Deppoh I would have drowned. Why didn't your own father jump in to save you? Because he can't swim. - You believe that? Yes, papa can't swim. "Deppoh, jump in or I'll get my nice suit wet." Go back to your own country... And never come back! Never! Bye Johan, have a good journey. It's going to be finest time of your life, Johan! Study, drinking, women. There are good women and bad ones. Watch out for the bad ones. Good luck! Dad? ls there a swimming pool on board? Of course! Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. How come? I swam in it every day on my honeymoon.

The past keeps pursuing me. an eye for an eye... Between who? Between me and him. Between father and Oeroeg. Father forced Deppoh to save me, didn't he? You were there. Would you watch your own son drown? Would you? So what happened? Deppoh drowned. Hendrik dived in after you fell. You were dragged out, then.. And then he was dragged out. Hendrik didn't have to order Deppoh. The order was in Deppoh's blood. He dived in to get his master's watch. When we found him, we decided that Deppoh died a hero. And that we would never tell the true story. Why not? Shame. The nobler his deed, the deeper we buried our shame. So father was paid back his debt. God damn it Lida! Why didn't you stop all this? Just as your father didn't kill Deppoh... ...as so, Oeroeg did not kill your father. I saw him by the lake. On the day father was killed. It can't have been him, Johan. He was taken prisoner 6 months ago by you guys He's in jail in Bandung. What will happen to me? Attention! Dutchman , go home Oeroeg Johan KEEP WALKING ! Are we still friends? Only if we are equals. Aren't we that right now? KEEP WALKING ! KEEP WALKING ! Not as long if 12 Indonesians are worth as much as you are. Ten Berghe! Lieutenant! Oeroeg! Here. Take care of it. Be safe... 'Near or far, we will always be brothers.' Right! IT TOOK 2 MORE YEARS OF BATTLE AND TALKS BEFORE HOLLAND... ...RECOGNIZED INDEPENDENCE OF ITS FORMER COLONY ON THE 27th OF DECEMBER 1949.
