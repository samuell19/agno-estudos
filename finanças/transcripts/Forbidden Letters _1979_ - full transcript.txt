Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [margin bell] [typewriter slide] [typing] [margin bell] [typewriter slide] So Larry, it's foolish for you to worry this late in the game. Richard's got his parole. It's only a matter of time before he's back, a free man. It wasn't a very easy case. Assault, robbery, not very popular crimes. After all, no one wants to get mugged. Of course, Richard wasn't thinking, using his head at the time. The jury understood that. And now, the parole has come through. And the worst IS over. I remember Richard, sitting right where you are telling me about the two of you, how you met, how much he loved you, your lives together, how much he was going to miss you. And Iris Rogers, she sat there too, offering to testify, to give evidence, a character witness. Well, considering her profession, it was a nice gesture, anyway. Frankly, if I were in jail like Richard, a homosexual, you know, in his place, I'd be glad you didn't send me any incriminating letters. Segregated quarters, no prison job, less chance for a quick parole. You were wise not to write anything that might have given him away. Not that I believe all that talk about electroshock aversion therapy. But it's always best to be on the safe side. Larry, you're foolish to worry about Richard. He's got his parole. He's coming back a free man. It hasn't been easy for you, for Richard. Assault, mugging. Richard was crazy. You knew it, I knew it, the jury knew it. But now, it's over. He's coming back. You'll be together, the two of you, alone at night to touch, to love. Of course, if they had known that Richard was a pervert, it might have been different. He might have changed. But you can tell him why you didn't write. He'll understand. Larry, you're a fool. It's late, Richard's free, free to do anything he wants, anything. He's capable of anything. You're capable of anything, two of you alone together. Richard, isolated, solitary, no words from you, no real words from you, only silence. He's back, it's late, and the worst IS over. [discordant instrumental music] [heavy breathing] [breathing rapidly] [breathing deeply] [telephone ringing] Yes? What? Yes, you did. I was dreaming. What? What dream? Oh, your usual nightmare. Well, get it out of your head, baby. Today is the day. May 27th, the big day. Baby, you've been sitting down on your hands for almost a year waiting for him. Tonight, you're going to see him. Jesus, you sound totally freaked. All right, all right. You're not freaked, it's just a little nervous. You got a right to be. I'd be hysterical, too. Yeah, you sound quietly hysterical. Right. What did you do last night? Where did you go? [ Last Night's Man by Paul DuBois ] My eyes can't cry and I know I wouldn't even try to let it out and so I just go through the motions Pretending it is just another night like all the rest I wish it were. I'm glad it's not, I hold in my emotions A year ago, I lost my love Yet, he remains a part of me inside my soul though far away my loveâ€™s still living I've walked this street a hundred times to find a smile, to hear the laughter, it's not easy when it ain't all of you you're giving Tonight, might be to lead me on to some stranger and then beyond his easy way and I will try to say I'm lonely The evening light is grey I see a friendly face who'll maybe understand the need I have to break the spell that holds me Who is this man? What's in his eyes? I see but I don't realize what's happening because I'm not sure of my feelings Should I smile back and play along? Should I say yes? Should I be strong? I just don't know if I can give him any feeling. Something that's soft within his voice his whispered breath gives me no choice. I'm feeling warm.. I kind of like this man to hold me My body's here, my mind is there. I'm trying hard to share a part of me. My lonely skin cannot deny its sadness. - Iris, what am I going to do today? Look, Larry, sweet, lovable, schizo that you are. Get out. Cruise, go to a movie, do something a little kinky. See a porno flick, get hot, take a Quaalude, sleaze around. Not the bars, the streets. Meet someone, talk, blow them, fuck. Do anything, but don't walk around rehashing Richard's letters in your head. You know how freaky you get when you start thinking about everything that's happened. Yeah, well, I know there's not much you can do on that, uh, welfare check they send you. But this is San Francisco, homo heaven. So get out, and I'll meet you for dinner at 7 at the Powell Coffee Shop. You know, where they have those rare steaks that you dig and the cashier that's always making eyes at you? Maybe he'll pick up the tab if you play it right. So, get your gorgeous ass out of bed and out of the house fast. Meet you at 7. Bye. [When Your Lover Goes Away by Dan Turner] When your lover goes away and you wait for his return. How long is the day until he comes back? And then in time and not to run. When your lover says goodbye, and you wait for his hello. No words can describe of the embrace or will he return. Days met upon may break the bond. Though you reach out, you won't respond. After you, he might recall the way he kissed you once and that is all. When your lover's far away, and you write him once again. An answer you say. Is it still love or will he sign my letter friend? Once you have loved, you can't regret. Feelings for him you can't forget. And find another man to take you home. When your lover goes away and you wait for his return. How long is the day when he comes back? Has there been time and not to run?

Every day feeling's coming on. You're afraid to show your love. So afraid to go along. [romantic classical music] [discordant instrumental music] [typing] - July 26th. Dear Larry, it's late afternoon. I'm sitting I'm sitting in the recreation yard watching the sky. I'm feeling sorry for myself. I've been here one month and two days. I think I'm used to it now. Thanks for the letter. I wish I had more to say to you. I miss you. I really don't know what to write. Nothing about nothing. I won't try and answer all the questions you sent me. I can't because I don't have too many answers these days. Larry, I really don't know what I'm feeling. I'm feeling something. But I don't know what it is. Nothing I could explain on paper. If that's a hassle for you, I'm sorry. But that's how it is. I'm just turned off by the scene here. It's like being asleep. My eyes are open, but I don't see anything. I walk and I move. Answer questions. But it's not really me. How I am... ...or used to be. [typing] - November 12th. Dear Larry, I'm in my bunk today. I got the flu. Too sick to work, not sick enough for the hospital. Anyway, I get a chance to just lie here and think. I hope you can understand me not answering all your letters. It's not that I don't like getting them. Most guys here are crazy for mail. Anything, magazines, books, even bills. I must be totally fucked up 'cuz I don't look forward to getting letters. They remind me of the outside and everything I'm missing. I know, I start thinking about that. I'll freak out, knock some guard's head off. So, I try not to think that or think at all. I wish I could stop thinking. Turn my mind off. I have to stop the memory trips I get into. Thinking about people, places, streets, parks, the beach. I'd like to just cut it all out of my brain. Lose it. Drop it somewhere. [typing] - May 2nd. Dear Larry, I'm being set loose from this cage real soon. Seems I've been a model zombie. No problems, very cooperative. [typing] I can't wait to see you. I'm very excited and that's bad, dangerous. Having any feelings here means trouble. I just pop and blow the whole setup. I'm holding my breath. Maybe I won't breathe it all. I can hardly keep it together. I feel like I'm going over the line. The two weeks to go has suddenly very scary. I can hardly sleep. I feel like I'm going to scream. I'm going to get out. Two weeks, 14 days. And then, air. And sun. And no one to ask where I've been and where I'm going. And food, real food. And seeing you. Love, Richard. [somber classical music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] - Dear Richard, these are the letters I'll never mail to you in prison - the feelings I know would get you in trouble if they found out what you are and what you mean to me. I'm writing in this book everything I would have sent to you if I were free and not frightened. Everything you saw in my eyes when I visited you and then had to hold back so no one could tell that we're lovers. Some friends told me to type these letters and sign a woman's name. They meant well, but they don't understand how it's been between us. So here's this book. I don't know whether I'll ever let you read these words. When you get out, they won't fit. They'll seem out of place, dumb and stupid. But right now, it's the only way I can talk to you, to myself too. In a fucked up sense, writing it all down is the only intimate thing I can do with you, 'til they let you out. I remember the first time I saw you, Richard. You didn't see me, but I saw you, in a tuxedo, a white tie, with studs on your shirt and glitter in your beard. It was Halloween night and you were with an outrageous drag queen. I wondered if the two of you were lovers and I knew right then and there that I wanted you, that I liked you. It was outside a club called Cabaret. It was a crowd, the streets were packed. It was my first San Francisco Halloween and I wasn't prepared for all the people, the costumes, the lights, the faces. So, I wandered. Just walking, like cruising, only there were too many people passing by to really catch anyone's eyes. You looked happy and stoned. There was a lot going on for me that night, a lot of firsts. But you stood out. I wanted to come over and say 'Hello'. I should have done I, but I was scared and excited. So I watched you make your way into the club and I wondered about you. What you were like to be with, to talk to, how you'd be in bed, what it would be like to spend the night with you, wake up next to you. It cost me a few bucks cover charge just to get into the club. But I made my way through the mob and followed you inside. I watched you dancing and got into the music and your date. She was incredible. Thinking back, I guess I was pretty wide-eyed and unsure. It seems crazy now to have watched you from the sidelines thinking you wouldn't like me. I still feel that way in bars, a little nervous. Just not on top of it all. That night, I saw more than just the Cabaret. I saw myself as maybe being part of everything around me, connecting instead of just watching. I know I wanted you from that first night. I can admit it here. I'd have given anything to be with you. [Harlequin Eyes by Tommy Talley] Images and faces, all my senses are careening the evening holds a mystery, somehow a sense of meaning a symphony of black and white, a gentleman's touch But is it just the mask I admire so much? Your hair is streaked with silver and your smile streaked with pain. Your eyes are streaked with anger, like I never want to see again Your heart is streaked with feeling like the depths of the sea I see through the mask. I see me Mirroring lies of a similar path intertwined and I feel sure but somehow inside there's a nagging suspicion like a premonition It makes me slightly sad and somewhat insecure The glimmer from your face form arms that wrap themselves around me They taunt me, tease me, pull me towards you yet they form a boundary They give me glimpses of a glance I know it's no disguise I've seen that look before you've got got harlequin eyes Harlequin eyes - I don't remember too much of the rest of the night. It's sort of a blur. I went back to the YMCA, to my room alone. And that was the first time I let my mind play with you, imagine you in a place, somewhere, alone like me, but out free. It became my favorite fantasy of you. One that would come back into my head over and over again, even after I knew you. [vocal classical music] - After we met and became lovers. I tried to forget that Halloween night when I didn't say 'Hello'. It's always been a part of me that's been afraid to reach out, make the first move. You knew that even when we got our place together. But you never brought it up. You just held me close and showed me your world. I miss that about you. Sometimes even more than your body. I missed how you looked at things. I saw so many places with you for the first time, like Land's End. I knew there were lots of people around but I didn't see them when I was with you. It's funny because it's just a place, rocks and trees and the ocean. I know there's nothing magical about it. It's sitting on that cliff of you. Looking at you. Touching you. It was like being in a dream, like the trips in my head. When I was a boy. [romantic classical music] - I miss just being out with you, Richard. When I was with you, I had the feeling that nothing could go wrong or seem out of place, that I could do whatever I wanted. And I didn't have to worry that somebody would come along and make fun of me or call me names or push me around. Being together was like that. It was easy. It was the way I always imagined it in my mind. You see, Richard. I always wanted a big affair with music and a perfect lover, you know, like in the movies, except it'd be boy meets boy, and zap, a great romance. Love with a capital 'L', crashing waves and colored sunsets. I played it cool on the outside, pretended to be very together, above it all, you know, casual. But on the inside, I wanted to be in love. Then you came along and turned me inside out. I got my crashing waves and colored sunsets but no hassles. We just did it. And more than love, I got laughter too, and a feeling that I wasn't alone. I don't know for sure, it's what I wanted was what you wanted, but you were so much fun. You seem to how to get me off, not just in my mind. I hope all these feelings are still there, that you'll still want me, desire me. That you'll still play with me, as well as love me. I can't imagine you changing. But I get freaked out that you'll come back hurt. That you'll return without your smile, or your tenderness. I miss that about you, Richard. Your tenderness, especially at night. [disco music] - It's late. My body, my eyes, and ears, my cock have been out cruising the bars and baths again. But my mind. My mind keeps coming back to you, your face, your hands, what it was like to kiss you, to feel you inside me. There were times Richard, times when I wanted to hold back something a part of myself from you. Maybe you felt it sometimes a fear. A fear that that you love me more than I loved you. I guess it's never perfectly even. But there were nights when, there were nights when I thought that I could have been a better lover. I never told you how it was to touch you, to be next to you, under you. I don't know. I think I was scared of letting every thought go, of turning myself over to you. Not just sucking you off or getting fucked but more like blending into you. In a way, I felt like I was becoming you. I'd been in love before, but I always kept my balance about it. Kept it cool. And I thought I was smart by holding out. I lost my balance with you Richard, and blew my cool and got into you more than I ever thought I could. There were times when I forgot everything who I was and where I was, just tumbled and got lost in you. [romantic instrumental music] - It's morning. I miss you, Richard. Miss your smile, your laugh, just being with you. Right now, I want to walk into this room and turn and see you, hear your voice. Look into your eyes. I know. now that I took it all for granted. You and me together, the whole setup. I got used to being your lover. Iris knew that about me. She read my beads from the start. For a while, I felt a little worried around her. She was your friend, Richard. When you first introduced me to her, I was shocked, put off that she was a hooker. When we all went down to Aquatic Park for that Tarot reading, I was convinced she was a phony. I didn't trust her. I thought that since she fucked for money, she had to be a total ripoff. As we walked along, I thought the whole thing is pretty dumb. Cards and questions, seem like a bunch of bullshit. Iris made me mad. You see, I liked her in spite of myself. I had this picture, this image of someone who sold sex as being hard and cold. But she was so open to us and she liked me, accepted me from the very first. I don't remember the reading what she actually said, you know, about the cards. I wasn't paying that much attention, really. I was into you and wondering what people might think about the three of us. Just sitting out there looking at that Tarot deck. I've always been like that, worried about what people might think if they knew me, the real me, what was going on inside. Being gay was the same 'til we met. I used to feel that anybody could tell what I was just by looking at me. So, even when I was outside walking, I felt a little like hiding, felt like I was different, strange. You and Iris, you took care of all that. You know, Richard, I never really played when I was a kid. I grew up fast and acted like a little man. It was like like I'd never been a boy, you gave me back the time I'd wasted. And now, there's time, but it's locked up, stopped like a broken clock that won't turn or move, frozen, stuck and it's weird. But now, all I want with you is time. [playful instrumental music] - I can't believe I didn't tell you these things when you were next to me, Richard, said the words in your ears. Whispered them to you so that you'd know for sure that I loved you. I'm freaked out today, scared that when you come back I may have changed. Nothing much else has. The place looks like it did when we finally got it fixed up. It's hard to picture you in a cell, Richard. Indoors all the time. Your day is laid out in advance, what you're allowed to do, what you're not allowed, all set up. Where you can go, and who you'll see. Richard, loving at a distance is no way to love. It makes no sense. It's a charade and my hands are tied. And still, I feel close to you. I haven't touched you in a year and still have you in me, how you move, your back, and hair, your mouth and breath mixed in mine. The way you undress, your sweat and cum, your spit. I can recall almost everything about you, where we used to get it on what we did. But I draw a blank on trying to remember your touch. I don't know how to remember that. Words and sounds are easy, at least there's an echo. But how to recall your body on mine, in mine? I don't know. It's not something I can do with my brain. My cock remembers. My arms and legs too. But without you next to me, leaning up against me. It's a lot of mind games. I miss you, Richard. There's no way I can write that down. No way to say it. How can I describe a hole in my life? Like, a section of feelings has been removed, and I'm left with a space inside me. A space that's filled with waiting. [wistful instrumental music] - It's last entry time in this book, Richard. And I've got nothing left to say or write, I think. I've gone over the whole thing in my head, a hundred times. And I still don't understand at all. Maybe some parts, but certainly not all the feelings. And now you're just about home and I don't know what's gonna happen. I'm scared by that. In a way, time stopped for me when you got arrested. And tonight, I want it to start again. How it'll go? I have no idea. [birds chirping] [romantic classical music] - Iris, I'm sorry, I'm late. I overslept. - That's okay, hon. I ordered for you. Steak, rare, and a Caesar salad. The house specialty. Money's no object. It's been a good day. Jesus, you look terrible. Don't talk. Eat, food's what you need. Who knows, Richard may want to fuck non-stop for three weeks, so eat. You know, it's weird. I've been thinking about you two all day. On the streets, up in the hotel room, thinking about how much you and Richard are in love. Hey, here I am at O'Farrell waiting for my John and keeping an eye out for Vice and I'm thinking about you two. Suddenly, it hit me. You two are the most mismatched pair I've ever met. I tried to come up with a more unlikely combination and I couldn't. There he is, a 31-year old mugger. Not some number picked up blowing a high school sophomore in a restroom or some queen picked up in full drag in Fresno or Kansas City. Nope, Richard, your everyday average, hoodlum. Six foot four, big chest, strong legs, huge hands, 200 pounds of hostility. Just who you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley and certainly no defense attorney's dream client. Then there's you. All starry-eyed full of music writing us letters you can't even mail. It's fucked. Yeah, yeah, I know. If they found out Richard was gay, goodbye prison job and early parole. Jesus, I'll never figure out how he wrangled that parole. Straight act is pretty good when he butches it up. Jesus, they must have been dumb, huh? On the other hand, maybe it was my letters to him that they opened. I put perfume on the paper and wrote some of the hottest lines I've ever read. They might've labeled him Stud of the Age. But you, you're a sucker. You know, you're in love with a time bomb. Granted, Richard's not your average time bomb, but he's got a fuse. A short fuse. Then there are times he acts like a big baby and you come on like Father Time. Bizarre, you and Richard, weird. - Fuck you, Iris. - Don't get me wrong, baby. I think it's beautiful. You know, I do. I don't know what makes people mug other people, but it sure has saved Richard the usual faggot riffs in jail. Nobody'd mess with him, he'd embalm anyone who crossed him. It's not like some gorgeous young thing like you gets dropped in the tank, with those hungry wolves. You'd get gangbanged before they got a chance to get into the gay section. But not Richard. He's tough. No Friday night mass rape with him as the mattress. It's funny, isn't it? The trip that sent him up the river probably saved his ass in the big house. But that's passed. Right now, he's on a bus on Route 5. And you, judging from our phone conversation this morning, you're wondering whether he's just the same. Well, he ain't. No way. Doesn't take a crystal ball to figure out the guy's changed. Maybe for the worse. Maybe our big baby's grown up. If he has, you know, we're in for trouble. That was the part that always saved Richard. Sure raised him above the usual jock types you ran around with. I mean, no one ever gave me a Japanese silk kite for Christmas until Richard. Or saved a complete set of patient number tags from the VD Clinic, 1 to 69. I gotta love a guy who runs an ad in the Berkeley Barb and puts my phone number. Do you have any idea how many people, men and women, called up asking for a quote "wild, tender, loving, boyish but forceful, hung, animalistic stud?" Well, I don't know how many calls there were but there were a lot. [piano background music] - What am I gonna do? - Other than going to the terminal, nothing. Play it by ear. He may get off the bus and zero, nothing. Go ahead feels to touch him, to kiss him. If there's any fire left in him. You'll know it then. Don't plan it. He may want to go to a cheap motel for a quickie fuck. Do it. He may want to get raving drunk. Do that too. Just keep him away from the cops. Richard's all front, like most people. It's one way on the outside and on the inside you figure. But Richard likes everyone to think he's fine all the time. Bullshit. No one's fine all the time. So don't go by that surface. Get to his feelings, his heart. That's where he hides passion. But if ever there was a person and a time for it, it's you. Tonight. - San Joaquin Valley. Local Bus. At gate number 22.
