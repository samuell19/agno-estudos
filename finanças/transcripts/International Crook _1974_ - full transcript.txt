After a long time you have remembered your friend! I thought you have forgotten me after joining the police force! Fool! Can a friend forget a friend? Why didn't you contact me for so many days? DDT! Bring sir's luggage from the jeep.. Shekhar, listen! I can't stay with you. I have come on government duty. I will have to stay at the government guest house. Government! Duty! SP, I think you can't sleep in a poor man's house. Again you taunted me! Duty is duty! Duty.. what must be your duty in this small town? Friend, this is a small town. But many activities are carried out here! I will explain to you when I am free. I will leave now. Listen.. don't forget your friend for the sake of your duty! - All the best! - See you! Sir, he is Chief Inspector of Customs. Diwan Dinanath. Mr. Dinanath, how are you, sir? Fine. Thank you. How are you? Fine. Thank you. I have heard a lot about you from IG. - Thanks. I was waiting for you only. - Come. I have to go for my duty. And you have come from a long journey. You must be tired. Rest for now. Have dinner with me in the evening. And we will discuss the matter there. Thank you, sir. I am lucky that I got the chance to have homemade dinner. - Pleasure is mine. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - See you tonight, Mr. Diwan! Bye! - Rao. - Yes, sir. Keep my luggage inside. Daddy, I am so sorry I am late. You are always late! Have a seat, dear! Mr. Rajesh, meet my daughter Seema. I have already met her in a pleasurable way. I.. I am still ashamed for that. You are embarrassing me by saying this. - Please have a seat. - Thank you. Great! - Have this. - Thank you! - Not so much! Enough! - Have some more! You too have some. My plate is already full. I will take. But you are not eating at all. - I am eating it. Enough, Seema! - Please! - Thank you! You too have some! - No. It's okay. Look, don't feel shy. Otherwise I will think that you are still angry with me. You are giving me so much food. I will have to go to the hospital from here. If such a situation arises, then I will be your nurse. You can surely kill me. I accept this beautiful death. Don't say that, Mr. Rajesh. You still have to achieve a lot. A police officer has to play with life and death. All that is fine. First finish your dinner. It's enough! I have to do some work too. Shall we, Mr. Diwan? - Of course. Let's go! David! - Yes, sir. Come in hall. Okay, sir. Mr. Rajesh.. This is the area.. Where smuggling takes place. Police and custom have raided this place many times. But no clue was found. One thing is definite. The smugglers dwell here only. Yes. I entirely agree with you, Mr. Diwan. These people have ruined the economy of the country. They smuggle gold.. and shake.. The foundation of the government. But who are these people? They belong to this country only. They dance on other's tunes. And they are leading to our country's downfall. This is some big international gang. Such people should be shot! They are not Indians! They are traitors! They have no nationality and no community! Why are you worried? As we sow, so shall we reap. You don't know, mother. It's about our country's honour. If I had my way I would force all Indian mothers.. To first explain national character to their children! To teach him to lay down their lives for their country! And only after that call themselves Indian! Very good, dear! I am glad to see your patriotism! Ms. Seema.. your patriotism has cast a spell on me. Can I expect to have one more meeting with you? If it won't happen, then it will be my bad luck. You have come so close, that staying apart is out of the question. Thanks a lot. Mr. Diwan, give me the permission to leave. Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Rajesh. Thank you very much for the nice food. - Yes! - Hello! SP Rajesh please! Sorry, sir! SP sir is not here! There is a gift for him. You can take it. Keep a close watch on all the trucks.. Passing through Dharampar road. - What's your name? - A patriot! Hello! - Today I have nabbed you! - What happened, constable? You will find out soon! Search the truck! - Okay! - Come on! Why is this truck empty? It's not a crime to drive empty truck, constable! It's a crime! This truck is used to deliver goods. And it's a crime to drive empty truck. Henceforth I shouldn't see it empty! Got it? When I signaled you to stop, why didn't you stop? I am sorry. I didn't see the signal. Okay! We will find out soon! Constables! Search the truck and frisk them! Sure! Sure! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Why did you climb up? Aren't you ashamed? Why to feel ashamed in doing my duty? Show me your baskets! Hey! You want to seize our baskets! The basket contains fishes and not gold! I know you all very well! - Hey! Hey! What are you doing? - What are you doing? Constable, what are you doing? Are you mad? Yes! You have spoiled the fishes! Now who will buy these fishes? Not just these fishes, I will cut open all the fishes in the oceans.. To check whether gold is hidden in it or not! Why are you after our fishes? Go and check the fishes in the oceans! Fine! I am leaving! I am leaving! Why are you screaming? Seema, why are you running away from me? My friends have told me so many things about you.. That now I am afraid of you. - What did they tell you? - I won't tell you! It will kill me! Tell me! What do your friends say? Sit at a distance! - More! - Oh God! Tell me! What do they say? My friends say.. that by saying no, men become women's slave. - Is that so? So you want to make me your slave? - Yes. What else did they say? My friends also say.. When men become fervent.. Then they should meet the girl's father and not the girl. I think your friends have fallen in love with me. And by teaching you wrong things they want to get rid of you. And they want to form a relationship with me. Seema.. how is your friend? Is she very beautiful? - Is she young? - Yes! - Is she capricious? - Why? What's your problem? I have no problem! Filthy man! You think about other girls! Yes, now I will have to think! Why? What's the flaw in me? Not flaw, injustice! I want to come closer to you and you are going away! Seema.. - You won't go away from me, will you? - No. Your love has made my plight bad! Yes, Seema.

I then researched it. After that I loved you. And darling, remember! If I get the chance then I will even lay down my life like them! Yes, darling. I will lay down my life! Hey! Hey! Hey! Shame! Shame! Shame! You don't fear the public. You don't fear your parents. At least fear the police. Is it a crime to love? Hey, lover boy! Why do you love openly? Think about the people! What happened, constable Rao? You both too come here! What happened, constable? Don't ask! If I had not come on time today then.. Your image would have got tarnished! This ruffian was going to kiss your daughter! What's the harm in kissing? - Young people should indulge in kissing! - Yes! Shut up! If my daughter starts giving free kisses.. Then who will give me dowry? Look, Mr. Rao. If you can give me 1500 gm gold, then you can stay! Otherwise leave! You don't worry, papa! I will load you with gold! Don't trust this ruffian! Look, if you want to get your daughter married.. Then get her married to a decent, reputed, educated guy. Even if he is of my age. This is something to ponder over! Sorry, sir! I am one minute late. - 1 minute late. - Yes. I got to know 1 minute prior. Oh! Then it's a great loss, sir! In this one minute, I could have.. - At this age? - Yes, sir! Yes, sir! - What's your age? - 32, sir! - 32? - Yes, sir! What was your age when you joined the police force? 32, sir! - 32? - Yes, sir! - How long have you been in police service? - 32, sir! Strange! How did you get stuck at 32? I stuck it own. Yes, sir! Yes, sir! You must have read about Bheesma Pitama in Ramayana! Not in Ramayana, I had read about him in Mahabharat. But you read it in India itself. Sir, his age was 275 years. And the secret of his long life was that.. He was a bachelor like me. Sir, you should count a person's real age after his marriage. You are right! You are an interesting man! Yes, sir! Sir, shall I come with you? No! If you want, you can go and.. Yes, sir! Now it is too late! Did you patch up with your beloved? That is not a problem. But her unlucky papa, he interferes a lot, boss! Boss, give me such an idea.. Such an idea.. - That he stops interfering! - Yes, boss! He should be completely defeated! What does her father wants? He wants a lot. He has big demands, boss! He wants 1500 gm of gold. You don't worry. I have said yes on your behalf! Fool! Will your father bring 1500 gm of gold? - Go and bring breakfast! - Bring breakfast for 2 people! - I have come to meet you! - I was waiting for you! But SP is always busy! I wish I was Tiger Singh. You would have then followed me thinking me to be a culprit. Under this pretext I would have got the chance to meet my friend. What do I tell you? I had come to arrest Tiger Singh! And I myself have landed into trouble. - What trouble? - A beautiful trouble. - Where did you find her? - In your city. I couldn't stop looking at her when I saw her for the first time. When I saw her for the second time, I lost my heart. When I saw her for the third time, I lost my senses. - Where does she lives? - In my heart. When we were in London, you would never take.. Any decision without consulting your friend. And here you fell in love without informing your friend. Till the time I don't fix the alliance with her parents.. How can I give her name to you? Then give me the girl's father's name. Diwan Dinanath! Why are you quiet? Is my choice wrong? - Your choice is mind-blowing, Rajesh! - Thanks. The girl's name is Seema. - Now it's my duty to help my friend. - Really? Its Shekhar's promise, Rajesh. I will never break my promise. - I will leave now. - Won't you have breakfast? I have had my breakfast. I see! So you too are in love! Who is that lucky girl? Girl? Say girls, Rajesh! Shekhar wants a new girl everyday. You don't worry. I will bring good news for you. I will wait for you. Boss! Boss, what have you done? You gave your love to your friend! Rajesh has done many favours on me! Anything that I do for such a friend is less! You go and do your work! Hello, Shekhar! Come! Come! Come! Where were you for so many days? How did you remember me today? I will call Seema. No! Don't call Seema! I have come to talk about Seema. That's good news! I have been waiting for this day for so long! You always wait for bad days. But not me! Let me tell you! I won't get Seema married to him! - Listen.. - Lajwanti! You know they are childhood friends! They like each other! To hell with that! I have always been against this relationship! And I will always be against it! More than me, you will regret it. Aunt, I have come to talk about my friend Rajesh alliance's.. And not my alliance. For SP? Why didn't you tell me before? We accept this alliance! Wait! I will just bring sweets! Is somebody there? Shekhar.. what is all this? It's all about destiny, Mr. Diwan. Congratulations! Shekhar! Shekhar, what have you done? Is this the reward of my love? No, Seema. Fate is testing me. Friend has asked for the sacrifice of love. But why are you making me the victim of this friendship, Shekhar! What's my fault? I am helpless, Seema. I have given my promise. Now even if God told me, still I can't break my promise. Who are you to take decision of my destiny? If you are helpless then I too am helpless! But I can't kill my love like this! I won't marry! I won't marry! Try to understand my helplessness, Seema. Love demands sacrifice. Love that doesn't give sacrifice, that love is not true. Even I am in anguish! But I am compelled to smile. Seema, this is want destiny wants. Forgive me. 'Is this the reward of my love?' 'No, Seema. Fate is testing me.' 'Friend has asked for the sacrifice of love.' But why are you making me the victim of this friendship, Shekhar!' 'What's my fault?' 'I am helpless, Seema. I have given my promise.' 'Now even if God told me, still I can't break my promise.' 'Who are you to take decision of my destiny?' 'If you are helpless then I too am helpless!' 'But I can't kill my love like this!' 'I won't marry! I won't marry!' Cheater! Betrayer! How dare you play this dirty prank! Rajesh! You were flirting with that girl and now you gave her to me! - No, Rajesh! - And you thought.. That I will marry her and shoulder your responsibility? Is this called friendship? Rajesh! I can even lay down my life for your friendship! This is what even I thought! But now.. Now I just want to ask you.. Why did you thrust that girl on me! - Rajesh! - Now you can keep your gal with you! Rajesh, Seema is not what you think of her! But how come that flower string was with you? Forget that flower string! Believe me, Rajesh! Seema is sacred like the Ganges! Marry her, Rajesh! Marry her! Only you can keep her happy! And look.. I have fixed your alliance! If you didn't marry her, then her family's image will be tarnished! Look, Rajesh! I beg you! I plead with you! You have done so many favours on me! Do one more favour on me! Marry Seema, Rajesh! Marry Seema! - Are you drinking poison? - Seema! Look here! Look here, sister-in-law! Look who is the groom! Shekhar! Seema, I had told you that love is very strong! It can face any big storm! So what? I don't accept this wedding! This is not a wedding! Its betrayal! It's cheating! I didn't expect this joke from you! This is not a joke! It's true, Mrs. Dinanath! Actually I was going to marry her. But when I found out about Shekhar and Seema's love.. I fulfilled my duty! This is not duty! This is betrayal! I will report to IG sir! That the police are harassing people! Now this wedding won't take place! Lajwanti! This marriage will surely take place! It's nobody's fault! It's all about destiny! Rajesh told me everything before marriage! This marriage is taking place with my acceptance and consent! Got it? "What sight of love did you cast on me!" "What sight of love did you cast on me!" "You made my plight bad." "You made my plight bad." "Even beautiful face is a vice." "Even beautiful face is a vice." "People only cast evil sight." "People only cast evil sight." "What sight of love did you cast on me!" "What can a person do when helpless?" "What can a person do when helpless?" "What can a person do when helpless?" "You have crossed your limit." "Even beautiful face is a vice." "People only cast evil sight." "What sight of love did you cast on me!" "You should control your heart." "You should control your heart." "There is twilight after every dawn." "Why did you make your plight bad?" "What sight of love did you cast on me!" "You made my plight bad." "Even beautiful face is a vice." "My heart is yours. I promise you." "My heart is yours. I promise you." "I understand your intentions." "I have already studied the book of heart." "What sight of love did you cast on me!" "You made my plight bad." "Even beautiful face is a vice." "People only cast evil sight." "What sight of love did you cast on me!" - Greetings. - Greetings. - Good! - Good! - Good! - Good! Sheikh has sent the diamonds for us! Give it to me! I will deliver it to Tiger Singh in Switzerland. These diamonds are mine! Don't forget that! My sweet love! Hasan! Don't deceive sir! Why are you inviting trouble? If Tiger Singh found out, he will not spare you! Get lost! Hey! Don't aggravate the matter! Shekhar! Shekhar! Okay, boss! Over! Listen! Inform everybody to stop today's work! Okay! I can even lay down my life for my country! Keep your life and country with you! Just do your work! Mad fellow! Leave! No work today! Stop today's work! Its Tiger Singh's order! Tiger Singh's order? Tiger Singh has gone mad! You are right, sir! He commands us because he has money! I will tackle him! What will we answer those from whom we have taken gold? If this continues, then we will have to shut down our business! And what about my money? - Yes! - Shut up! - John! - Yes, Kaka sir! Tell Jagga to stop only gold fish's supply today. Remember, Pinto! Boat number 40 will surely depart! Kaka sir! Kaka sir! DDT has taken the gold fish! Thank you! Thank you! Idiot! What is this? Will I open a fish shop here? I had told you to bring gold and not fish! Papa, you can't eat gold! You can eat fish! Fish contains all the vitamins! Eat this and your face will glow like gold! Mama and Saridon's health is not fine. So I got fish! How is that possible! I will eat this fish! And their health will improve! - Of course it will! I will improve my health! - Yes! - Take your fish and leave! - He won't leave! - He will leave! - He won't leave! - He will leave! - He will come with us! - I will fry this fish! Come on! Come! - Okay! This man is a fool! People are crazy for fish! And he is returning fish! Gold! Gold! Oh my God! Oh my God! Did you see? DDT, you crook! You have made a big blunder! Why are you yelling? I didn't do anything! Your husband made a blunder! Yes! You idiot! Had you not asked for dowry, we wouldn't have got in this mess! You fool! You took the dowry! - You took it! - You took it! - You took it! - Order! Order! Order! Come on! Remove your jewelleries! Remove all the gold! Come on! Come on! Hurry up! And write your name!

Remove your cap! - This is a police station! - Okay! - Mr. Rao! - Yes! What are you doing? First we got married. And then you brought us to the police station! What can I do? You don't want to come here! And I don't flatter people! Look, girl! I am on duty! Don't induce me! Hey, you! From where did you bring the gold? I didn't bring it! God put it in the fish's stomach! - I only bought the fish! - From where did you buy the fish? I bought it from my boss's company truck.. That delivers fishes everyday. Shekhar! - Hello, Mr. Rajesh! - How are you, Mr. Diwan? I am fine. You tell me. What news have you brought? The news is that today constable seized 1500 gm of gold. Well done! 1500 gm of gold! Dharamdas Tiwari has given the statement that.. His boss Shekhar gave him this gold! Shekhar? Yes! My best friend and your son-in-law! We are forced to doubt him, Mr. Diwan. Mr. Rajesh.. So what if he is my son-in-law? Even if my child had been a culprit.. Still I wouldn't have been lenient. Thanks. This is what I expected from you. We received the news that Shekhar is returning tomorrow from.. Flight number BOC 3796. I have posted CIDs at different places. So that we receive the information. Okay. - I need one more favour from you. - Tell me. You go to receive Shekhar at the dockyard. And keep a close watch on his luggage. So that we can arrest the culprit along with the evidence. Welcome, boss. Okay, boss! Cheers! - Welcome, boss! - Hello. Welcome home, Tiger Singh! Diamonds! - Diamonds! - Diamonds! Very good! Very good! It's worth 50 lakhs! All real! Very good! Very good! DDT took the gold fish! What were you people doing? Pinto! Yes, sir! When I told you to stop the work.. Then why was boat number 40 allowed to depart? Boss, we had stopped all the work! Kaka sir insisted! He ruined everything! How dare you disobey me? What happened? I am equal partner! I am not a slave! That I will obey orders! Kaka sir! Maybe you don't know the outcome of disobeying me! No, no, no! No! Please, Mr. Tiger Singh! This is not what I meant! Henceforth be careful! Danger! Somebody is coming here! Who could it be besides the police? Shekhar! Shekhar! Shekhar! - Hi. - Greetings. - How are you? - I am fine. How are you? - I am fine. Where is Shekhar? - He was here only! Then where did he disappear? - He will be here only. Wait. I will send him. - Okay. Shekhar! Shekhar! Shekhar! Dharamdas! Ma'am, not Dharamdas. I told you to call me DDT. Where is your boss? Fine! Fine! I didn't see boss going out. Which culprit are you searching for, SP? Who will be a bigger culprit than you? You left me alone for 2 months! Where did you disappear? I and sister-in-law were waiting for you since a long time. You should have peeped in your heart! - I see! How was your journey? - It was beautiful! Open your suitcase and tell me what have you brought for me? - Open the suitcase! And take whatever you like! - Is that so? There are many things in this too! Only saris in this! I am sure this has something for me! Only two suitcases? We didn't get any time for shopping, Rajesh! But since when did you take custom officer's duty? You are searching it thoroughly. I thought you must have brought many things for me. But I didn't find anything in this. - Shekhar, I will leave now. - No! Have tea! Sorry, Shekhar! I am on duty! Nowadays you are so busy with your duty! What do I tell you, friend? It's all because of Tiger Singh! Bye, sister-in-law. See you, Shekhar. Shekhar.. Hadn't we brought 4 suitcases? Yes, Seema! I gave two suitcases to Kaka. Listen! Where is my umbrella? What do I know? You forget things! And you ask me where your umbrella is! Here is your umbrella! Take it! - But how did it come here? - By plane! Shekhar.. Why do you always get so angry? Seema, I am not angry. You just feel so. I am not angry. Come. According to you Shekhar had 4 suitcases.. - When he disembarked from the boat? - Yes! But I saw only 2 suitcases in his house. Shekhar had disappeared for sometime. When he returned, he got frightened when he saw me. I think the matter is serious. Sir.. if you permit, shall we raid his place? Now it's too late! We don't have any evidence. Listen.. I want tight security around Shekhar's house. And remember.. no officer should sleep on duty! Got it? Sir, I won't let anybody sleep! - Okay! - Spread out! "Keep a close watch. Stay awake." "The thief shouldn't escape. Stay awake." "Keep a close watch. Stay awake." "The thief shouldn't escape. Stay awake." "Hey, mister. Whenever you will become the minister." "Hey, mister. Whenever you will become the minister." "Keep a close watch. Stay awake." "The thief shouldn't escape. Stay awake." "Hey, mister. Whenever you will become the minister." "Hey, mister. Whenever you will become the minister." "The thief shouldn't escape. Stay awake." "I saw.. And along with that inflation." "It affects each and everyone." "Don't cry." "Because of this.." "Because of this, I never got married." "I never got married." "Keep a close watch. Stay awake." "The thief shouldn't escape. Stay awake." "Hey, mister. Whenever you will become the minister." "Hey, mister. Whenever you will become the minister." "Keep a close watch. Stay awake." "You are asleep. And the enemy is alert." "Wake up. Otherwise you will be in trouble." "Hey!" "That country will be robbed." "That country will be robbed, where the guards go to sleep." "Where the guards go to sleep." The green signal has been given. Jamal Pasha has the goods. Leave immediately. 311.3 North. 7. - It's gold worth 5 crores. - I will leave immediately. No! The goods won't be delivered through the port. Already the police are after us. So what? The police are in our fist! Don't talk nonsense! - Pinto! - Yes, boss! The goods should be cleared from underwater tunnel. - Underwater tunnel ready! - Go ahead! Beware! Hands up! Boss, our link with Jamal Pasha's boat.. Has got disconnected. And boss, we have received the red signal too. Red signal? What about the goods? God! I knew it! That I will be ruined! Tiger Singh.. what was the need.. To bring such a big consignment? - Shut up! - Congratulations, boss! The consignment is here! Quickly open this! Otherwise he will get a heart attack. Very good! Very good! Very good! I knew it! Tiger Singh.. As long as you are there.. No harm can befall on these gold. Seema has come. So this is your business, Shekhar! - How dare you! - Seeing your illegal activities! This is my business! If this is your business, then shame on this business! Shame on this luxurious life! Seema, you have made a mistake by coming here! Now don't cross your limits! When you have crossed your limits of humanity.. Then why do I have to stay in my limits? Shekhar, I could have never imagined that you will be like this! Now I know your true form. Now I know why strange people come to meet you. - Because you do smuggling! - Seema! If you had to be a traitor.. It would.. Have been better if you had died! Thanks a lot for this favour! I have received the reward that I deserved. Now I won't live in this house even for a moment! This is too bad, boss! She shouldn't have come here. It's very dangerous. She saw everything with her own eyes. And now.. as per Syndicate's rule.. She has no right to live! Kaka sir.. Beware if you uttered a single word against Seema. If there is even a scratch on her body.. Then I won't spare you all! Pinto! Quickly hide the goods! Inspector, what evidence do you have against me? If we had any evidence then you.. Wouldn't have been free like this. Then why are you guys harassing me? Tell me. Why did you set your house ablaze? I should be asking you this question. When you people were there, then who set my house ablaze? Thank God I was not at home at that time! Fine! But can you tell us what forced.. Seema to leave her house at midnight? Mr. Diwan, this is my and Seema's personal matter. You don't interfere. You don't worry. I won't let my wife be a burden on you. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! No! I don't want to be a burden on anybody! What burden, dear? We are poor. But we have a big heart. Only a human come to a human's aid. It's a sin to commit suicide. Come, dear. Come. Mr. Rajesh. You couldn't seize the gold. And that gold is going to be smuggled tonight.. In the form of silver from Alibagh beach. - But why don't you reveal yourself? - You will surely meet me. Hello! Hello! Law can reach far and wide, Shekhar. By closing your eyes, don't think everybody is blind. Law won't spare you. When did I beg for mercy from law? SP.. if you have any evidence then you can arrest me. I have not come to arrest you. I have come here as a friend. Your wife is missing for the past 4 days. Maybe you don't even know.. Whether she is dead or alive. This is my personal matter, Rajesh! - You have no right to interfere! - Shut up! You could stoop to this level.. I could have never imagined! You are my friend, Rajesh. I can't raise my hands on you. Don't put a stigma on friendship, Shekhar! I am ashamed to call you my friend! The man who can betray his country.. How can he be anybody's friend? There is a patriot who helps law in every step. And you.. you have betrayed your country in every step! Shame on such a friendship! I wish I could rip apart my heart and show it to you, Rajesh. I wish I could rip apart my heart and show it to you! - Where are my goods? Where are my goods? - We want our goods! You have got the gold! We want the goods! - From where will we give it to you? - I don't know anything! The police have blasted our den. The gold perished in the fire! Now how can we give you the goods? Kaka sir.. I have the gold. Supply the goods to these people. You all can leave. - Thanks, Shekhar! - Thanks, Shekhar! No! Shekhar.. till the time I don't see the gold.. I can't believe you. You doubt the party. Forget all this! We have been exposed. The police are searching everywhere. Anything can happen in the future! Even thieves should be honest! Shekhar! I don't tolerate my humiliation! Tiger too can't tolerate disobedience! What do you care? I can't work in this party! I can't work in this Syndicate! Settle my account! Account! Kaka sir, I have to settle many scores with you! Congratulations! Syndicate's message! A big deal! What deal? Whose message is this? Sheikh.. King of smuggler's message! What's the message? Gold worth crores are coming to India from Bangkok. Very good! Chhota Sheikh, very good! Now you people will have to seize the gold from the ship! But.. nobody besides Tiger can do this. The Syndicate is broken, Kaka sir! Chhota Sheikh, where are you going? - Talk about the deal with me. - How can I? Its Syndicate's rule that the deal.. Should be discussed only with Tiger. Goodbye! Tell me, Sheikh! Tiger Singh, Kaka sir pleaded a lot with me. But I didn't pay any heed. Why will I? Its Syndicate's order. My boss Sheikh Padar told me that.. The deal should be fixed with Tiger Singh. Sheikh Padar? 'I am alive just to meet him.' 'His gratitude made me Tiger from a human being.' What's the deal, Sheikh? Do as Pasha says. Go where he sends you. Diamond worth 15 million pound is going to arrive. Diamond? Sheikh, you said gold is going to arrive in India. You are great! Do smugglers ever speak the truth? - Go to Alaska with Pasha! - Alaska? - Yes, Alaska! - Okay! Deal is done! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello, Tiger Singh! Look! "International crook." "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "International crook." "International crook." "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "International crook." "International crook." Sweethearts! You both are the most beautiful girls in the world! What's wrong with you? Are you angry? No, I am not angry! What do you think you are? I have heard that Tiger Singh and you studied together in England. And I have also heard that Shekhar is your best friend. Don't worry, sir. Friendship is nothing compared to duty. Very good! This is what I expected from you. Now you can declare him a criminal. And declare a reward of 50,000 rupees on his arrest. - Okay, sir. - Thank you! All the best! How come you all are here today? What has brought you here? - What's the matter, Mr. Diwan? - Where is Shekhar? I dismissed him a long time ago. But what's the matter? Shekhar has disappeared with gold worth 7 crores. Gold worth 7 crores! Well done, Shekhar! Great! You have served our country well! Served? Constable, our country needs gold desperately! Our country could have got gold worth 7 crores! Shekhar should receive a reward for this deed! - Bhuta Singh, you too are misunderstanding! - How so? You brought gold worth 100 rupees. Okay. But when did I bring it? Just assume that you brought gold worth 100 rupees. - Okay. - How will you make the payment? - By giving the goods. - How much? For gold worth rupees 100, I will sell it at 200. So it's a loss to the country. Goods worth 100 came in. And goods worth 200 went out. Constable, how can this be a loss to the country? The gold entered the country for free. That is what I am asking. Where is that gold? That is the problem, constable. I don't know where the gold is! Sardar, you don't know. But Kaka sir surely knows. Am I right, Kaka sir? Won't you serve your country? Mr. Diwan, I can even lay down my life for my country! - Kaka sir.. where is Shekhar? - I don't know! Kaka sir, don't fool us! Where is the culprit? I think you don't know that the government will reward.. The person who helps to seize the gold by giving 10% share. Kaka sir, constable is right. We give you 10 minutes to think. You can think. We are waiting for you outside. Let's go, Mr. Diwan! Listen.. Bhuta Singh.. The police is right. Then? This is the golden chance to serve our country. - You are so lucky. - How? Go with the police and get Shekhar arrested. - And get myself killed! - Shut up! I will give the address. You can serve your country. Fine. Send Ms. Kitty in. Did you call me? - No, Ms. Kitty. Your good luck has called you. - What? - The police are waiting for you outside. - Police? The police know that you are hiding here. Now I can't hide you here for long. - There is only one way left for your escape. - What? Go with the police and immediately get Shekhar arrested. No, no! I can't do this! Then be prepared to go to the prison! Ms. Kitty, there are only two ways in front of you! You can choose any one. Fine. I will go with the police. Very good! Very good! Shekhar! - I want my share! - I too want it! - I too want it! - I too want it! Shut up! Tiger doesn't listen to nonsense! And he is not a fool that he will hand over.. Goods worth lakhs and crores to you all! So that you all fight amongst each other! Everybody will get their goods when the time is right! When will that time arrive? I have been after you for 3 years! And you don't listen to me! I made a sale of 15 million pound in your diamond! And in return.. I will never spare you! I will never spare you! Why don't you give us our share? Remember! If our boss found out then he won't spare you! And our boss will follow you! You don't know! He doesn't like deceit! He will not spare you! He will kill you! Tiger kills people! And gradually you will find out whom Tiger wants to kill! I want to first meet your boss Sheikh Padar! Where is your boss? Mr. Shebiro is in Alaska. Sheikh Padar is in Iran. Since ages I was craving to meet both of them. The goods will be delivered to your bosses. Boss! Boss! Run! Run! Hands up! Don't move! Arrest all of them! - Deceivers! - Sir! - What happened? - Tiger Singh! - Tiger Singh! - Yes, sir! - Take all of them to the police station! - Okay, sir! - Mummy! - Let go of my child! You! Come, son! Seema.. Seema, you are here. I searched for you everywhere. Seema.. Seema, believe me. This separation has tormented me a lot. Even my life has not been smooth, Shekhar. I don't know for which sin I am paying the price. For God's sake leave! Don't force me to get you arrested. Don't give people the chance to say.. That for 50,000 rupees a wife got her husband arrested. - Leave! - Seema, give me my child! Leave him! Don't remind me that I am the mother of a smuggler's son! Mother, is he my daddy? Your daddy is dead! He has ruined our happiness and peace! Fine! I am dead for you! But don't instigate my son! Who are you to separate me from my son? Son? Whose son? A criminal's son? A smuggler's son? Take your son! I hate him! Seema! You can hate me as much as you want! But don't abuse my son. Nobody is born evil in this world. People's circumstances make them evil. 20 years ago, destiny played a cruel joke on my family. You know.. my father used to work in the lighthouse. Stop! Think before you do anything! I have thought about it! Let's inform the police! How will we reach to the police? Smugglers have surrounded the lighthouse! Have you also joined hands with them? You may think so. Traitors! Today because of people like you.. The country's state is bad! Patriot! Sheela! - You! - Shekhar! - What happened to you? - Father! - Who has done this to you? Traitors! Raman has joined hands with the smugglers! Today I saw him.. And he did this to me! - I won't spare him! - I will kill him! Son.. son, go and inform the police immediately! Don't let the smugglers escape! Don't let Raman succeed in his plan. You all risk your lives! But.. but.. but the police.. Father! Shekhar.. I will go and inform the police. You won't be able to do this! Because you all know a lot! So as per our law.. You have no right to live! You are right! And you.. Traitors have no right to live! You all are not humans! You all are traitors! Shut up! Otherwise I won't spare you! Even God can't stop a person from speaking the truth! Shut up! No! Scoundrels! Even if time and law spare you.. Even if people forgive you.. But God will never spare you! Kaka sir.. Let's kill all of them here only. Why should we commit this sin? Why don't we send all of them to Mr. Shebiro's boat? So that they all will drown. There can't be any person more evil than you! Remember! Your end too will be like this! You too will drown. Shut up! Take them! Come on! Come on! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave her! Leave me! Leave me! Leave her! You people killed my husband! Now you want to rape my daughter! I can't see all this! You can't see all this! - You can't see all this! - Leave me! Leave me! Leave! Leave my mother! Leave her! My sister killed herself to save the family's honour. And I jumped in the ocean! A captain sailing a ship saved me! I finished my education with Rajesh's help. I can hear my mother and sister's screams all the time! While dying my sister had said.. To take revenge from these scoundrels! And that desire of revenge has made me Tiger! Seema.. till the time I don't take revenge from them.. I won't rest in peace. I won't rest in peace! "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook. Crook." "International crook." "International crook." Did you see a man wearing red shirt and blue pants? What? Inspector, why are you questioning him? He is dumb! He is dumb! Did you see him? No, sir! I am a poor man! I just do my work! I didn't see anybody, sir! - Leave! - Okay, sir! Inspector! They are running away! Hurry up! Inspector! Come! "They are the real cheaters. They are the real cheaters." "International crook." "Crook. Crook." "International crook." Beware! Beware! Beware! Right now Tiger Singh is in Goga! And he is trying to escape! Very good! Syndicate's loyal man! This is what I had expected from you! Tiger! Hello! Police! Deceiving is your old habit! Remember! Many years ago you had killed.. The entire family of Goga lighthouse's in-charge! No, no! That family had drowned! But one guy from that unlucky family had escaped! Today he is standing in front of you as your death! Then you will remember this knife too! I used it to kill your father! - Where is Shekhar? - Who? - Tiger! - You will find it in the jungle, sir! Where is Tiger Singh? I don't know! I don't know! - Sir.. his grave is ready! - My grave? - Bury him alive! - I will tell you! I will tell you! Tiger Singh is in Iran! Iran? - Where is the gold? - I have the gold, Sheikh. But how could I have brought it here? I have hidden it in the mountain. You can take your share. Let's go. - Where is the gold? - There. Have you buried the gold here? You will be buried here, Sheikh. Why was the bullet fired? I think something is fishy! Remember.. in front of me you had killed my mother. I won't spare you, Sheikh! I won't spare you! As per our information Iran Interpol had raided the place. Sheikh Padar was killed. And Tiger Singh fled. Informer Yasmin is in Iran police's custody. Yasmin says that Tiger will surely go to Alaska to meet Shebiro. Hello. All planes follow Alaska Safari N8108 Yankee. I repeat. All planes follow Alaska Safari N8108 Yankee. Over! Yasmin, what is this? Why was Sheikh killed? Now it's your turn. How dare he! I will finish him! Where is the gold? - Gold? - Gold! He has the gold. We will equally share the gold. Now Tiger is going to come. Take this. Lipstick bomb. Open this, apply it and then close it. Then put it in his pocket. He will die after one minute. Okay, boss. - Hello! - Hello, Mr. Pinto! - Mr. Shebiro! - Yes! Tiger Singh! Welcome! Won't you come in? Foolish girl! I didn't trust you! Shoot! Please! Please, Tiger! Listen! Run away! Police! Jaggu! Leave me, boss! He is our enemy! I will kill him! Leave! Leave! Jaggu, stop! Shekhar, I will sacrifice my friendship for the sake of my duty! Don't try to assert favour on me by killing your friend! I am not asserting any favour, Rajesh! I am just fulfilling the duty of my friendship! I too am fulfilling my duty! Surrender yourself. Otherwise I won't hesitate to shoot you! Fine, Rajesh! If this is what you want.. Then I surrender myself. I am sorry, my friend. I had no other option. Pinto! Admit Rajesh in the hospital. - Boss, where is Jaggu? - I have killed him. And you saved this enemy? - Have you decided to kill your men? - Shut up! The one who locks horn with Tiger Singh.. he will be killed. Do you know war has started in India? This is the golden chance to become rich. Gold's price is going to increase four times. So we will return to India today itself. Come on. To save India, donate generously for defence fund. Today India needs gold desperately. Kaka sir, we too need gold desperately. - Mr. Anwar, come. - Greetings. Come. Have a seat. Kaka sir, luckily there is a war. And war is a good chance to make ourselves rich. And our country is ready to pay any price for gold. That's the misfortune, Mr. Anwar. I am telling the truth. I would have given you the gold. But what to do? I don't have the gold. Kaka sir! You will get the gold. Fix the deal with them. Mr. Anwar! We have gold worth 7 crores. What price do you quote? - I am ready to give double the price! - Okay! But we need opium, cocaine, marijuana. Where are the goods to be delivered? Near Lakhaidi island. Bring the gold. And take your goods. The deal is done! Wow! Nice deal! I will make the remaining arrangement! Now you all can leave! - Greetings! - Greetings! Let's leave! So Shekhar has sent you both here? To hell with Shekhar! Now he is not capable, Kaka sir! He has started killing his men! His intentions have turned bad, Kaka sir! So why should we help him? - Right! It's futile to give milk to the snake. - Correct! Where is the gold? Gold is safe wherever it is, Kaka sir! You help us and take your share! Fine! But let's form a plan. You sail your ship S.S Verona in the direction of.. West 20 East 32 and station it there. We will reach there. We have to deliver the goods at Lakhaidi island. Good! Good! Done! Done! This is betrayal! Kaka sir, we might be smugglers! But that doesn't mean that we put our country at stake! We ruin our country! And sell our motherland! Kaka sir, can we sell our motherland? "They will even sell garden and air." "They will even sell garden and air." "If they had their way they will sell God." "If they had their way they will sell God." "International crook." "Crook. Crook." "International crook." - Bhuta Singh! - Yes! - Do you want to lose your life? - No! If you spilled out everything, then you will lose your life! - No! - Listen! - Yes! Patriotism and business are not linked with each other! - Got it? - Okay! Where is Shekhar? He has gone to Alibagh to meet his wife. Shekhar, look at your state. Why do you wander around like this? Why don't you surrender yourself to the police? At least you will feel at peace. Peace? That's why I have always helped the police in the name of patriotism. Seema.. Now what I am doing.. I am doing it for peace of my mind. That day is not far away when you will take my name with pride. Beware! That day will never arrive! Shoot him! If you want to save the child's life.. then drop the revolver. If you didn't come out till I count 5.. Then we will kill the child! 1.. 2.. 3.. No! Give me my child! Leave him! Leave him! No! I won't let this happen! I won't let this happen! Seema.. leave with the child. No, Shekhar! I won't leave you alone! I will die with you! - Move her from the way! - No! Leave me! - Take her away! - Leave! I say leave! Bhuta Singh! Shekhar! John and Pinto have joined hands with Kaka sir! They are supplying the gold to our enemies. Run! Don't worry about me! Don't worry about me! Bhuta Singh! Kaka sir! Prepare the biggest tube. You will have to go to deliver the gold with John and Pinto. Gold from all over the world comes in India. And India's gold goes abroad. Kaka sir, Syndicate has come to an end. Now for which party do we have to deliver this gold? Kaka sir, he is dim-witted. Till the time he doesn't.. Understand everything he won't work. You explain to him. Sher Khan, the enemy country is paying double for the gold. Got it? We will earn four times the profit through international means. Meaning they will buy weapons with this gold. - And use it against us in the war. - Sher Khan! Sher Khan won't do this derogatory act! And he won't let anybody do this! - I tell you to obey my orders! - Impossible! This gold is our country's wealth! Our country needs it desperately! You want to ruin our country by selling the gold to the enemy! No, Kaka sir! Sher Khan will lay down his life for his country! But he won't let this happen! Take the reward for your patriotism! John, Basheer will be at the port with the truck! Go and check! - Kaka sir! - Yes! We had already given the instructions. That he should be at Aaram port with the truck! Pinto, you will remain a fool. You won't understand anything. Come on! Come with me! Oh God! Pinto.. it's not good to interfere. Kaka sir, what are you talking about? Fool! This gold is worth crores. And John is no longer required. Just think. You risked your life, you locked horns with Tiger Singh.. And did this great job. And John should get his share for doing nothing? Now think. What is the need of John? Oh! Kaka sir, now I understood. - We don't need him! - Yes! You are alive! Good! Good that you have come! That Pinto shot John! You are intelligent! Use your brains! Take advantage of this golden chance. Become rich. Let this launch go. I won't get anything in this deal. Kaka sir! Where will you run? Beg! Implore! But I won't spare you! Tiger Singh, please let me go! Forgive me! You will surely die! I have to settle old scores with you! Scores with me? Yes, you! 20 years ago the man who was the in-charge of Goga lighthouse.. His soul is still waiting for revenge! But what is your connection with this? Won't a son take the revenge of his father's death? Why, scoundrel? Tiger Singh, forgive me! Don't kill me! For God's sake, forgive me! Today even God can't save you! Go and drown! Come, Shekhar! SP, my mission is over. And I surrender myself. I was waiting for this day only, Shekhar! I have found out about your helplessness. But you have committed a grave mistake.. By taking law in your hands. I wish you had told me this before. But I will try.. That the law is lenient with you. Taking into consideration the police's recommendation.. For taking law in your hands, you receive.. 7 years imprisonment term. "Only you dwell in my heart." "Believe me." "Beloved, this is true." "Let's love in the open." "In my heart.."
