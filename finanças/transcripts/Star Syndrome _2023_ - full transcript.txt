2005 Indonesian Music Award has just been held. Jay and the Others took home two awards. Besides winning New artist of the Year, the band, whose single is entitled Simpang Siur also won the Top Pop Rock category. Congrats, Jay and the Others. Folks, 2005 has been a wonderful year for the one and only Jay and the Others. [multiple narrations from tv channels] "Simpang Siur" has certainly made 2005 stage for Jay and the Others. Bands come and go in Indonesian music industry. Will they thrive on the top? Or maybe the will be another one hit wonder band? Time will tell. 14 YEARS LATER Is everything set? The crowd's getting sick of me. Games and prizes are gone already. I even asked them to chant. Waiting for peanuts. Do more chants. ♪ Seafood seafood seafood ♪ Faster, dude. Not right there. Come on. Done? [cheering loudly] Right away, go! Be careful. Don't you drop it. [knocks on door] Yes. Come in. A bowl of peanuts. And their shells. As on the riders list. [groaning] [groaning painfully] [sighing heavily] Van Halm. Do you know? On his riders list, he always requests a bowl of M&Ms Without the brown ones. When he gets to the back stage and he finds there are brown ones, that means the EO isn't care enough. That also means the crew has to double check. Things that I have to do now. It's all clear. Tell the MC, we'll be on in two minutes. No problems. And the peanuts? For you two. Time flies and here we are, at the end of 2019. Let's hope for a fresher start for us. I know from your faces, you can't wait anymore for the main performance tonight. Please welcome Jay Adi! Good luck, Jay. The crowd's difficult. Not for me. Welcome, Jakarta! [silence] Yes! Wait. Yes?! Can you make some circles? Nope. - Failed? - Yes. Dud, bring up what's on the bottom. What?! What's going on here?! Okay. This time I, Jay Adi, will bring you back to 2005. "Simpang Siur"! ["Simpang Siur" playing] What?! Isn't that supposed to be the last? I have no idea! No more show for him! Such a mess! Thought "Simpang Siur" was the title only. His set list is too. Put this Jayanto on the black list! Jayadi! ♪ You like what I like ♪ ♪ I like things you like ♪ ♪ Then it feels different ♪ ♪ In a way we don't even know ♪ ♪ Haven't meet for long time ♪ ♪ Once we meet, not for long ♪ ♪ My heart could be broken ♪ ♪ Broken to pieces ♪ ♪ Don't let our story die ♪ ♪ So we can together be wet ♪ ♪ I am not a seasoned chicken ♪ ♪ Your attitude got me bruises ♪ ♪ Love me and hate me sometimes ♪ ♪ Your love really puzzles me ♪ ♪ Simpang siur ♪ Before you talk, let me say it. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been out of tune on the last song. It's not about that, Jay. The songs! The set-list! "Simpang Siur" should be at the end. That's the main show! Excuse me. We're taking the chairs out. Excuse us. It's getting harder to sell you. The event organizer didn't know you. I had to sing "Simpang Siur"! One full song then they know who you are. You saw the crowds. They're bored already. I sang "Simpang Siur" the last, and there wouldn't be any crowds at all. That was a stage decision. You should have told me! It seemed we didn't want to cooperate. We handle everything. If the EO talks to the others. Got into EO's WhatsApp. Goes viral on Instagram. Many have canceled us! And now this! I could get my headache. Had to visit the doctor for a gastric attack. Took our saving. I have to save up already for our meals. And just remembered I haven't got my lunch. Excuse us. For the next two months you have no show. You know what that means? I couldn't get you a job! Messed up. What kind of manager I am. Don't see it that way. No jobs means that I can finish my single album. Put those canceled us on the list. Once I came back and my single becomes a hit, they'd beg for us. Excuse me. We're taking the chairs out. Mind us, please. Jay. Let's have dinner. I'll skip that. Anna is alone at home. She's probably on bed already. I'm off. Wait! It's from the organizer. Give it to Dadang. Dud. Eat with me. Sorry. No dinner after 7 PM. Diet freak! You want that one? That's mine! Off you go! Taking everything.

Halo. - I.. - Jay. Sorry. Jay, right. Jay and the Others, isn't it? Hold on. When my first album was released you were seven or eight years? I got enrolled in the elementary school. But I listened to Jay and the Others from secondary school. My teacher brought the song up. "Simpang Siur". I'm Zul. Jay's manager. I'm Nur. Nur. I've listened to your recording. Recording? Which one? Indonesian Dodol? The one you recorded afterwards, with Dudi. That's my song. What!? I am so sorry, I didn't know that's yours. I'll tell him to delete the recording. And I'll post an apology on Instagram. I'll do it tonight. And that is cool. Excellent. You add your color, making the song different. And that is enough to make me coming here asking you to sing with me. Duet?! You said earlier. You'd give chances to younger artists. Now you say duet? What else? Give your song. Let her sing. I'm the one who want to come back. But you said... So sorry. Sorry. My mother wants to talk. Video call. Isn't that Jay Adi? Yes, Jay. Jay Adi. Let me introduce properly. I'm Nur's mother Rita. Rita. Nice to meet you. Can you repeat? So, I'd like to invite Nur to sing as a duet with me. [both cheering happily] Behave! Don't embarrass me. Don't you lie to parents. I don't. My Goodness. Nur. Alhamdulillah, Nur. It's a gift. Alhamdulillah, indeed. Jay, dear.. Sorry, can I call you that? Yes, surely you can. My dear Jay. Thanks very much. You are a gift from heaven. Thank you, again. May God bless you! Amen to that. My dear, Jay. Would you mind? repeating what you've said I'd like to record it. She wants to record your statement. Sure. Wait, please. How is it? At the bottom. This one. Found it? Ready? Please. I want Nur to sing with me as a duet. In my latest single. [sobbing] Crying? Don't cry. Are you happy? I've changed some of the lyrics to fit us. What? It's nothing. It's a little different from "Simpang Siur". Not Malay pop. Ello (you). Me? Not you. Ello. Marcello Tahitoe. Are you wondering why he is so different now? Compared to his early career. From what I've read labels controlled artists. Exactly. That happened in "Simpang Siur". I'm doing all differently here in this project. All's done by me from my heart. My idealism. Simpang Siur no more. And for (ello) you Marcello Tahitoe. This is you. If you want to be successful you have to believe in the process. Believe in me. The point is. I'm making you who I was 14 years ago. Okay? Okay. Let's warm up. Dud! Come on. Warming up. Start. [making funny noise] Enough. Let's now vocalizing. Ready, Dud? ♪ Laa laa ♪ ♪ Laa laa ♪ Nice. ♪ Laa ♪ [high-pitched voice] ♪Laa ♪ Relax. Hold on. ♪ Laa ♪ [high-pitched voice] ♪Laa ♪ Zul.

Labyrinth Labyrinth? Not enough. It needs more... more... Duration? more... Shorter? more... Arrangement? Poison. It doesn't click. Your song's foggy. Just like the title. - Labyrinth? - See. Bewildered when entering Couldn't get out. You know what labyrinth is like. I once told you this. When you had the third album. Didn't I? Really? I did. I forgot that. My memory is a little What was that? Foggy. Why don't you make malay pop. Jay and the Others is a Malay pop icon. When you make a move in this current wave Jay and the Others It'll be awesome, money comes in. It's not all about that. The second and third albums were all more pop than Malay. That's why turned out not selling. Right, listen! If you still want to be with us here Change the music to be more Malay. The lyrics as well. Make it more Malay. Just do what I tell you to. Throw away your idealism. It's nonsense. Take this, especially you Jay. In your previous label had you listened to what I said. Jay and the Others wouldn't be like this mess. [laughing mockingly] [chair crashing] Terribly sorry. What are you doing? Put it down! So sorry, ma'am. What The chair Excuse me. The chair! You are all poison. The chair! First lesson for you, Nur. That's what we do to those who disrespect our work. Shouldn't be that much, though. Seventh lesson. What? This is the seventh. The first lesson to warm up before singing. The second is head voice technique. That's enough. Zul! Hum? Put this label on our black list. They listed us, instead. No problem. Four more labels for today. I'm pretty sure. They'll buy our single. I have good feeling. Can I help? I got this. Jay. Do you have Instagram? I'm not on Instagram. Seriously? No Instagram? My turn to ask. Are you seriously asking that? You haven't listened to my single. The thing is. That's a company's policy. You must have an Instagram account. I have one. Instagram. How many followers? Last time I checked around 300. How many? Three hundred. Three hundred? Say it again. Three hundred. Three hundred. [chuckling] That's even fewer than Pamela's. Pamela has 500 followers. Who's Pamela, by the way? New comer artist? Over there. That's Pamela. Hi, Pamela. That's a little not valid. Comparing her with a guinea pig It has their own market. That's my point. If we can take its market share Why not? But that means... Stop! Can you two just discuss that in person later. WhatsApp number? That's not what I meant. What about my single? Sorry. What's your name again? Nur. My name's Nur. Your name isn't selling. Nur is my neighbor's name. Old school friend's name. Our parents'. That's the same era as Wati Budi. Agus. It's not the name wrong but that's the demand of music industry. My name's Rusmana. If I wanted to sing I had to change my name. There is no artist named Rusmana. I'd say, for example Diana Rus. Try now. What's your full name? Nur Aini. Ouch! Aini! Aini is more associated with hospitals. Eye Center. Sorry. I interrupt. To me Nur has no problem. It's just fine. Why? Because she sings with me. Doesn't matter. Asep Portal, Dadang Poltus, or Udin Petot. No problem. As long as the duet is with me. No problem indeed. Nur is just fine. It means light. Light. How about "Shine"? So we can feel the pop's vibe. What do you think? Agree? Agree! I share your view. That's close, Jay. So close. [inaudible] Jay. Social media cannot be used as a parameter in music industry. The artist's name too. As you can see. Artists in my label company. They use their real names. As written on their identifications. For example, Iwa Kartiwa He's famous. Successful. Dewi Chandra too. Iyang Darmawan. And Arya. Those are real names, although sound like some rubes. There is one of their artists named Johanna. They use western names instead and use Joe. Turn out, thank God He failed to make a hit. [inaudible] Jay. Those people on my level, here... should only give essential questions. Not drifted off. I totally agree on that. Jay. Before I'm listening to this demo. The is one essential question. Surely, sir. How much do you weight? A quintal? More. Can you make it 40kg? Should be possible! We've been here for more than half an hour. Doing nothing but wait. I am sorry. I've got information that you haven't made any appointments. Young lady. Do you think I'm a new comer who has to make appointments. Tell your boss inside. Jay Adi wants to meet. Now! Yes, sir. Just a moment. What are you looking at, Nur? That dazed. Pamela. It has more followers than I do. That's it! Absurd! Making that as an indicator in music industry. Super weird! But Don't you want to have Instagram? Pamela has a lot of endorsement. Don't discuss such thing with him. Too much complicated. Jay, listen to this. Let's call it a day. We'll continue tomorrow. Too long. Let's just wait here. We'll be called soon. It it were 2005. They'd even forget how you look. Jay. Sorry. Please. The meeting? Has been postponed. They want to meet Jay. See. Hi. Sorry interrupting the meeting. Please. [on music player] ♪When you are in doubt ♪ ♪ And even falls ♪ ♪ Rise and move forward ♪ Do you remember? "Kalud". The second single in the third album Jay and the Others. He's a fan, then? Hopefully. Do you remember? The fact that none of the band members liked this song. But you secretly swapped one song so this song could be recorded. Of course you forget. Indeed. Only me who did. Since The song you sided away was mine. You lizard! Indeed. Chemistry in a band is crucial. I'm now in a label company. Not as a musician. Yet I still meet you. We meet since you work in label company. Not chemistry. Hello. I'm Jet. I'm the A&R here. And I used to be Jay and the Others ex-keyboardist. You didn't notice me, did you? He was the mastermind. Everything was about him. All about him. So sorry. This is off topic. I'm a little bit carried away. Looking at a curly vocalist in a red jacket. Irritating. Let's get to the point. Here is a demo CD. JAY ADI AND NUR Talking about demo. I remember on thing. You cancelled our fourth album. No correlation. It's up to me. I can relate whatever I want. Just like what you did. Got out of the band. Starting a solo career. Dumped the others. The fight hadn't begun, you ran. You knew the label was shitty. Communicate that. Sure you want to have a duet with him? Let me tell you. Be aware of this guy. He doesn't understand about chemistry. Shut your mouth! Do you even know what chemistry is? - Now, say my name. - Jet. You know that Jet is an acronym. What's J for? Johan. Jatmiko! What's E for? - Edmiko? - Edi. What's T for? Teddy! Tadmiko! [Jay shouting] Stop them. No need. No need? Alright. [Jay whimpering] I yield. [Jay whimpering] We're doomed. Your video isn't going viral. Your two faces aren't clear. Those who know will only be you, Jet and older people. And most of them are with label companies. So we can just forget labels of your single. I'm in this as well! We're done. What are you afraid of? Calm down and relax. I'll think of some solutions. I mean Nur and I. Isn't that right? A solution? Surely. So, what's the solution? Are you insane? Take your word. I agree with Jay. Agree. We don't need any label. We can make everything on our own. Let's make a move on social media. Instagram, Youtube. No Youtube. See. Youtube is... It isn't that. The thing is Youtube's for those who have just started their careers. You don't need that. You have me. And one more thing it's difficult to get viewers on Youtube. Getting a million viewers needs a long time. Right? We don't do that. My come back should be phenomenal The solution is - Don't lie! - No, sir. PERPETRATORS ARRESTED WHILE DRUNK Ginger tea?! That's liquor, isn't it? Answer me! Planning to mug people? That's his. Hey, don't move! Catch him. Hey! Don't move! We mug people? TV. TV shows. All Indonesians still watch TV. The people behind TV and label are the same. Same people who are sick of you. No problem. We need to find the right person A person who has power yet objective at the same time. You know who that person is. Mr Tuna. Ha... Who's that? You're welcome. [Jay] His real name is Tubagus Wardana. Shortened as Tuna. He's been on TV from the late 90's. Your performance was excellent. [Jay] One of few people who has power. But he's down to earth person. It's not enough. But he has potentials. [Jay] Most importantly he has great taste of music. Isn't always about money. If it's good and he likes it. He'll make it happens. How about performing on Tonight Show. Yes, surely. [Jay] He's perfect for us. But How can you tell that he's not one of those who hate Jay. I meant with... I repeat his words only. He's sick of him. But he's a fair person. Past is past, for him. I forgot, sorry. Silly me. And he sometimes gives chances to troublesome artists. Exactly. He needs to listen to my single. And Nur's. Mr. Tuna will be Jay Adi has come back. And Nur. But we cannot see him on TV. Too complicated. Has to be in his office? Or anywhere. Your point is From what I've observed this week he's been to The Inner Light three times. TIL. Yes, if you shortened that. TIL. Yes. My point is I once performed in TIL. I know the manager. We can make use of Jay's name as well. We can certainly performed on stage while Mr Tuna is there. See. I give some advice you give another. That's chemistry.

No. We're friends back from elementary school. He got his talent even back then. When we were in art class while other students made some random crafts he wrote a song. Since then, he took singing seriously. And he developed. Here, in this cafe I agreed to be his manager. I promised to take him to the top. We made it.

Her early band career in Potret. Thanks. Potret 2 is my favorite album. It was released in '97. Indeed. Your favorite musicians would definitely come from that era as well. Potret. Risa Sita Dewi. And everyone's favorite Dewa 19. With Ari Laso of course. Once is awesome. But If I had to chose.. I'd chose Ahmad Dhani with long hair, not long beard. [Jay chuckling] Jay. You know what? I once heard There is a conspiracy theory saying that Ahmad Dhani isn't real him. He's been substituted by another person. Look closely. He's different. Am I right? Thought I'm the only one noticing that. What about Ahmad Dhani. Nothing. Done practicing. Done. We'd like to continue upstairs. Are you using it? Nope. [Nur choked] You never told me Anna is your sister! Why should I? You should! That's Anna Sweet Judgement. Isn't she? You messed up. Dadang. Yes? Can you please take a picture? Anna Sweet Judgement and I. Can I have a photo? Sure. I love you work. I watch your videos. "Hey Kamu" is a great song. A nice song. Thank you. Get ready.

List of questions has been sent to your phone. You start it. Will do. Let me open it. - We've agreed. - Whose account we're on now? You told me to use yours. Meaning I'll start. Hi, everyone. It's nice to see you again. As promised we're taking some questions about me and Nur. Let's go the first one. Okay. First question is from Wow. What a name! Okay. First question. Hi, Nur. I really like your voice.. Here it is, the question. To you, Nur. What can be improved as a musician? I'd say... She's on the track. As long as she keeps practicing, she'll make a lot of progress. The second question, Nur. Nur, how did you become a musician? Okay, so... That's on our youtube channel. Complete answer's there, you can check. Okay. Please, your honor. The third question. Nur. Nur. Here you go, for Jay. Hi, Jay. In your spare time What are you doing, Nur? In my spare time I wash dishes... [lonesome background music] Mommy. Mommy Rita. Assalamualaikum, you should say. Not Mommy Rita! Assalamualaikum, Mommy Rita. [both chuckling] - Mom. - Hum? M-TRANSFER SUCCESSFUL: TO NO-MONEY BANK : IDR 2,000,000. What's that? Settled. Father's debts are settled. No more debt collectors coming in. [Rita chuckling] Actually, the last debt collector was hilarious. - Mamat? - Yes. [both laughing] It's good that the table sheet is back. Table sheet! Nur. Thank you. You are very welcome, Mom. Is the motorbike in the repair shop again? Why? [unclear speech] What? [unclear speech] What are you talking? Sold! Did you sell it? Of course I did. Hah?! There's other debts and this one just can't wait. Rather than having more debt collectors. But you always ride that to the market. Don't think about it. Take it easy. Don't worry about me. Now, you go have some shower. Go. Don't do it, mom. As long as the heaven is beneath mothers heels You have to obey. You silly. Go have a shower. You smell. It's a pity that Rolling Stones are now gone. I knew one reporter. Soleh Solihun Where is he now? Taking religious path. Following his name. Is it still long? She's here. Should be. Wait. Let's just start with me only. - Jay, don't start. - What? You know what I mean. This is like what happened with the Others. Jet got more girl fans. You changed. You blocked him in interviews. You blocked him on the stage. I was the vocalist. My name's on the band's name. I did what I had to do. Taking control. Not that way, though. [phone ringing] Sorry. So sorry I'm late. Sorry, I'm late. So sorry. It's fine. No worries. Yes, sir. Good, thanks. How can I help? Mr Tuna. Yes. Okay, sir. Thanks very much. Yes. ♪ Like a black out ♪ ♪ Without you my love ♪ ♪ Like the night would never end ♪ [Tuna chuckling] [Tuna chuckling [man yelling] Who's yelling? Sounds familiar. That's a friend. Pongky. No wonder. Okay. My point is Doesn't matter where you start. Especially in your case, Jay. You know the number of celebrities I have helped. And almost half of them. I found them in unusual places. In a zoo, cleaning staff, spa house. This maybe a little bit embarrassing for you. But here you are. With this lovely super talented girl. [Tuna laughing] Nur, I've watched your latest cover song. It's cool. You've been making much progress. [Nur chuckling] For sure. That's on my trainer. I can see that. I also watched you covered Adele's song. The vibe's so sad. Amazing. Thanks a lot sir. By the way. What can we actually help? The point is that I want you to be guests in this program. [people applauding] The only question is, how you can memorize "Black out" lyrics. [people laughing] Maybe because I have a really good memory. Having a good memory and experiencing it aren't that different. [people laughing] How about Nur? You like old school music, don't you? She loves old bands. Dewa 19, Rida Sita Dewi, Potret. It's all old bands. No wonder you sing with an old one. [people laughing] Expectations. What do you expect from this single "Labyrinth"? Please, Nur. - We... - We really hope to Nur. Jay's been taking all questions. So excited. Haven't been on TV for a while? [people laughing] Please, Nur. It's simple for me. I just hope that people welcome our song well. And befriend the song when life's hard. When you listen to our song, you can get out off the labyrinth of life. That's cool. Please get... It's also simple for me. I hope people now realize Jay Adi is back in the music industry. Yeah, sure. Please get ready. Ready? Thank you. Where are you staying? Hey! Just saying hi. Let's wait no more.

Jay. I'm off, bye. Now you don't need me to talk to him? Mr Tuna is in hurry. What did you talk about? Um. He's asking to perform live in TV's anniversary next two weeks. There'll be a segment for social media musicians. Nur gets in with two other musicians. Meaning... Nur and I are in different segment? He asked Nur only. And you didn't asked for me. Jay. And what did you say? I haven't... But you do want it, don't you? It's a good chance. You want it, right? You've been waiting. When you no longer need me. Not here, Jay. This should be my show. Your part is to support me. Not the opposite! Take the offer if you want! Look at me! [Nur sobbing] Do remember this. Every step you take on the stage is because of me. I brought you here. I made you. [Nur shaking] Yes. If that's your advice I'll take it. Good. Don't sing my songs. Jay, you do know these all sound dumb. Take care of your new artist. [somber background music] [car door slammed] [bike bell dings] Nur. [Rita chuckles] Father. You two haven't gone to bed. Let's come inside. Thanks for opening the door. @NUR.AINI: FOLLOWERS 23.5K [no sound] Who asked you? Zul said to cheer up your studio. Just go. NEX 9.0 NOV 24, 2019, 8 PM [Jay] Every steps you take on the stage is because of me I brought you here., I made you. What more excuses? I haven't got the feelings. Please remind me why you are here. Because I can't sing my own song. So I have to sing... My songs? Is that it Yes. You delay others for more practice. Don't you know. I do. Break for 5 minutes. After that I want your 5 times effort. Got it? Yes. I'm sorry. Humm. NEX 9.024 NOV 2019 Hi. Do you have Nex TV channel? You do? Do watch it. Of course. That's Nur. She'll be famous soon. Even more than Rafi Ahmad. She has a beautiful voice. Therefore she is now practicing. She said she wanted to sing with Hetti Koes Endang. ♪ Aaaaaa ♪ You see. That's great, isn't it? I told you. See you tomorrow. Bye. [Rita exhaling] Let me guess. You've been sad for a few days. Is there anything to do with the fact that Jay Adi isn't enlisted? [Nur exhaling heavily] Nur. Hmm? You now stop thinking about paying debts. Don't worry me not having a motorcycle. I have a bike now. Now, it is the time for you to start thinking what matters to you. Yourself. Alright? I don't know, Jay. Routine show is big. If only once in a while I can make it. As a guest start would work for me. The thing is when you were on the show last time, the rating's bad Aha! I might have something for you. Sending it. Okay. [phone dings] What show is this? Roast night? Yup. Basically, it's a stand up comedy show. They roast a guest every day. Armand Maulana. His name's cool because he's on stage. In a stadium he would be Armand Mau-run. When he was a victim, he'd become Armand Mau-report. If he went naked, he'd become Armand Mau-pants. Not funny? [door knocks] Please welcome Oza Rangkuti. [door unlocked] What do you want? I come here isn't as your manager, because I know that you'd forget about your own birthday. A legend.... Where do you want to eat? More pizza? Up to you. I just learned that Armand went to University of Indonesia. For only nine months. Studying or expecting a baby? Is there money in this show? Why does Armand even bother coming as a guest? Or maybe on of his songs started from a dating site. They mock him. Mr. Tuna has invited me to that show. Sounds cool. Which segment will you sing? Closing segment? Isn't it? Not to sing. So? As a guest star. You'll be roasted? [Zul laughing] It's funny after all. See. That's funny. They laugh. [Zul laughing] Armand, Armand. It's all useless. Maybe indeed there is no more place for me. Are you listening? Seriously. Don't know where Anna is? She's coming home tonight. - As usual. - Not tonight, though. She's in Australia. Sweet Judgement is having a 5-city tour. Cool! SWEET JUDGMENT : ELECTRIFY EAST COAST TOUR 8-20 NOVEMBER 2019: AUSTRALIA Hi, guys.. Back with me Joko William a.k.a Jo William. And right now, we are here with Sweet Judgment. This is Ana as the guitarist. And Ayu as the welder. They are incredible. They are having a tour in Australia. And if you're watching this that means they are in Australia having the tour. What's amazing is that this is an Electrify East Coast Tour. I have listened to your musics as well. Really heart warming. How did you make them? Can I answer? Yes, sure. I always believe that whatever is done passionately will spread contagiously. One of the reason why I am here is I got infected. By who? Infected by my brother. I heard your brother was a musician. He is still a musician. He might not know that my passion for music is from him. I got my music, my vocal from him. He must be proud of you. He should be. [phone ringing] Jay. Zul. If she isn't taking my song what song is Nur singing? [door unlocked] Is Nur at home? Dear Jay, isn't it? Yes. My dear Jay is in my house. Oh God. Dear God. He is on TV and famous! Oh thank God. So handsome. That's enough. Is Nur home? What do you want? What did she do wrong? She's lost. She looked confused the whole week. That's why we are here to help Nur. Is Nur here? Nur is in Nex TV. Practicing? ♪ Don't you compare me with him ♪ ♪ We were created differently ♪ ♪ Different ♪ Okay. Break for five minutes. Okay. Sir. I'd like to have a word. Go on. I'd like to resign from... Rizal. You get some part wrong. [phone dings] JAY No wonder it's out of tune. This part also. ["Labyrinth" playing on phone] I WANT TO LISTEN THIS VERSION ON STAGE Nur. Ha? What did you say? I want to change the song. I want to sing my own. Ha?! I couldn't hear it. I want to change the song. I'm singing my own song. Jay. I am truly sorry. For what has been said. And for my act for the next few days. We have only a week. To make you shine brighter than the other headliners in the show. Control your breath. Focus. Good. Control your breath. What is wrong with changing songs? You don't even advertise the title of the songs. That's the point. What people know them from social media. Then she should sing that song! It's nothing to do with the composer. That's it. Bye. Stop. A break? No. I got this. One more time. Done. I said once. I'm kidding. [no voice] Turns out skipping last time was effective. For sure. You should see the trainer. - And who is that? - Me! Excellent, isn't she? Yes, but I'd say she still needs more movements. Human moves. Movements are life. So you shine bright like a diamond. Try this. Try. - Are you serious? - I am. ♪ Believe that everything will be fine ♪ That's what I'm talking about. Rihanna. ♪ God must have a plan ♪ Is everything OK? No. Yes, you can. I cannot. Please. You can check it and see how it goes. I cannot do this. You still have some time. Please have a try. It's all on you. No time for changes. My apology, then. We cannot have live band.

I'm telling my father. So sorry. Solve this. Make it work. Focus. I might still need your charm. It's all gone. It's all transferred to you. Nur. Please stand by. Yes. Go. Nur. I'll never going to give you up. Rihanna! Jay. - How are yo doing? - Good, thanks. Ooo. Are you the mystery guest? Er, [MC laughing] Nex TV has done great job. I'm the MC but I don't know that you are here as the mystery guest. Cool. Thank you. Good luck. You too. Bye. Everyone. This is the moment we've been waiting for. A young talented musician who has stolen our hearts. The one and only. Big applause for Nur. [people applauding and cheering] ["Labyrinth" playing] [music stops] The music went off! I don't know. Why is the music off? What's happening? It's been troubled. I checked everything before coming here. Ha! [people murmuring] The minus one track isn't working. Wait.

And then getting jobs by sabotaging somebody else's minus one tracks. That's a managerial thinking. [all chuckling] [Zul exhaling in relief] See. [all laughing] Eh. If there are three of us we can use Sweet Judge Nur. Am I right? [Nur giggling] What do you think, Anna? No. How about Nur Judgment? [Ayu smirking] Let's just start. Guys. Be selling artists. Unlike Jay. Sorry, Jay. Okay. We're recording live. Anna. The tempo is like last time. Okay. Ayu. Keep your voice low. Yes, sir. Dudi, stop moving. Nur. Like yesterday. Understood.
