[playful music] [lips smacking] [Bird moans] [lips smack] - Excuse me, but for your information, the line to register for the bikini beach contest is a few booths up the beach. Just trying to help you. - What you here for? - I'm here to register my mixed CD in the contest, so I can win that money and get signed, you know, get a deal. - Mm-hmm. - What you here for? - Same thing. - Oh, okay, you in line for your man, all right. While he out hollerin' at another breezy, okay. He got you well-trained [laughs]. - I don't have a man. I'm registering myself. I'm a hip hop artist. [Donzelli laughs] - "I'm a hip hop artist." - Next! - All right. Ooh, yeah. - Come on, I'm gonna need your $300 registration fee. - Cool. Keep the change. [woman scoffs] What, you aren't allowed to take tips? - We're not allowed to take funny money. And your money is hilarious. [Rebel laughs] It should be hosting the new Def Comedy Jam. Now bounce. - [laughs] Oh it looks like you're a little short, shorty. - You know what? Mind your own business, you old fake-ass J-Lo. - Uh, that'll be Rebel Rouser. Don't let the good looks fool you, homie. - Next! [Rebel laughs] Come on, girl. - That's... - Woo-hoo, man, what's up, dog? Oh, you got your new lifeguard uniform on, hmm? Lookin' spiffy there, man. - Apparently, it ain't that spiffy. I mean, hell, females still ignore me. Man, I thought once I became a lifeguard that females would like me. I'd become cool. I'd be the man. - Look, man, I'm a reformed player. I could tell you one of the golden rules about being a player, baby. A man always want to put his hand inside a woman pants, but a woman always want to put her hand inside a man pocket. Do you see what I'm sayin'? - I don't get it. - Man, act like you got cash, and you more liable to get the ass. - I don't have any cash. - Fake it till you make it, player! Man, never mind, oh, would you look at that. A'ight. - What you, what you doin'? - It's called minding my own business. You should try it sometime. - Look, Tomasina. - Tommy. - Okay, Tommy, I ain't been nothin' but cool with you ever since I met you yesterday. But you keep being all saditty and stank. That's it. I ain't being cool with you no more. My friendship, either you're in or you're out, right here, right now. - I'm out. - So, well, do you want to, yeah, you want to take, like, maybe take a little time, maybe think about it or something? That's a, you know, I'm rushin' you, you know. You're in or you're out. - Here we go! The winning team gets to split up $1,000! [crowd cheers] Ladies, ready, set, go!

[bell dings] - You see the thing is, it's like, I'm cool with most of the people in the industry already, so it's just like a matter of time before, you know, I get a record deal and just blow up your way. You know, it's like Master P, Russell Simmons. They was all, like, the homies. You know what I'm saying? Me and E-40, we like brothers, shit. - Hmm, you'll have to introduce me. - To 40? It's nothin', consider it done. That's my boy. Yo! This is how I can make some cash to enter into the Boogie Beach Bash mixed CD contest. And I'd have some money left over to go up into the studio. - How? - By catching this Beach Bandit. - You're not gonna catch the Beach Bandit. - Why not? - 'Cause I am. - What you, what you... [Tommy grunts] All right. Be like that then. We'll see who catch the Beach Bandit and come up on some money. May the sexiest person win. And that's gonna be me, 'cause I got sex, sex appeal, the sexiest. - Hey, Tommy, you ready for some lunch? - Yes, let's go. - What you doing? - Hey, yo, homes! You didn't get the babe, because you're not flashy enough. What you need to do is get some ice, ese. You need to get the blingy bling, homes! - I'm cool. - Okay. Hey, yo! Blingy bling! Blingy! - You all right? - Yeah. I think I stepped on a seashell. - Yeah? - There's no blood, only a bruise. - Let me take a look at it. Beautiful. - The bruise? - [Raymond] The feet [Miranda laughs] and your leg and your arm. - Gracias. I'm Miranda. - Raymond. - Nice to meet you. [upbeat music] - [Bird] There it is. - This is your car? - Yup, this is all me, the Yellow Canary. - I thought you said you had a Benz. - Huh? I, I do and a Porsche, a Range Rover and a Bentley. - Ooh, take me for a ride, papi, please, please? - Yeah, we can do that. - Hey! Can you two kissin' fish raise up off my car? This is expensive paint. [quirky music] [tires screech] - Um, see, uh, that was my baby cousin. You know, I just let him use the whip sometimes - No, no need to explain. I understand. I mean, I know how family can get. - You do? - Mm-hmm. Why don't we go somewhere a little more private, so we can get our freak on? - Let's do that. Come on, let's do that. - [Raymond] How's that? - It feels so good. But it looks like my girls are ready to go. It was nice meeting you. - How you gonna just walk out of my life like that, that quick? - Maybe we should exchange numbers? - Definitely, we have to exchange numbers. [upbeat music] - Call me. [upbeat music] - Look at you, still gettin' more ass than a pimp with hydraulics on his Cadillac. Ooh, she do got hella three-wheel motion goin' on with all that booty, yo! - She do, don't she? [both laugh] Hey, it's not even like that, man. She was hurt, and I was just helping her. - So y'all didn't exchange numbers? - I mean, just to be polite. Listen, man, I'm with, my heart is, is with... - London. - My heart belongs to London, man, you understand? I won't even pick up a phone to call Miranda. - I'm glad you feel that way, man, 'cause her number just got washed away. - No! I know the first one was 760. What's, come here, help me, man. What is that? Is that a three or an eight? - Man, you are pathetic, man. Look, I came over here to tell you we need to come up with some dough to register our mixed CD. I'm out, dude. You pathetic. You need to go back into that Tricks Anonymous program. You got problems, man. You got problems! You a ho! [quirky music] - What's up, Cali? All right, we need two more players for the pie-eating contest. The winner's gonna receive $300. [crowd cheers] All right, looks like we need one more player for the pie-eating contest.

[Donzelli growls] We have no winner yet. All right, looks like we got a winner, oh! Winner of the pie-eating contest! [crowd cheers] [crowd applauds] - You know, when you purchased them handcuffs at that vendor booth, I knew right then you like to do it real nasty. - That's the only way I like to do it. [Bird moans] Take off your shorts. - Right here? Look, man, I don't think this is a good idea. You know what I'm saying? I mean, this is my first day on duty, you know, and I can get in big trouble if I get caught. - If you get caught. No risk, no reward. - All right, all right, all right, you got me, you got me. All right, I'll take 'em off. All right, step back, step back, step back. I got this. These too? - Close your eyes. - That's right. [quirky music] You know, I got to admit. This is my first time ever having sex, and my first time ever gettin' a mic check. But I'm ready whenever you are. [quirky music] Kelly! Kelly! - Aw, damn! - Hey, bro, bro, man, come on, listen, man, listen. There's a vendor about a quarter-mile up the beach that sells a pair of handcuffs. Go there and purchase a pair, and they're gonna give you a key. Come back and see me with the key. And please, whatever you do, don't tell nobody. - All right, all right, I ain't gonna say nothing. - I appreciate that, man. Please, hurry up, man, please. - Yo, there's a dude back here bucket-naked! - Oh, oh, hell no! Oh, oh! [sirens whine] [Bird sobs] - What in the hell? What's going on with you, huh?

Her foot had a pretty bad swell to it, man. She probably got it kicked up with ice on it. [phone beeps] - All right, man. Suit yourself. You know you got a foot fetish, right? - Man! - You need to seek some help, some counseling or some shit. I ain't never known a nigga that feel on and rub on so many different feets. You probably got foot fungus all up under your fingernails [shudders]. - No damn foot fetish under my fingernails. [playful music] - The fuck is...

[solemn music] - Should've socked that fool in the mouth. - Thanks for standing up for me, tonight. You didn't have to do that. - I wanted to. - I misjudged you. I thought you were this insensitive guy who just ran around sayin' slick shit, and the only thing you cared about was gettin' in somebody's panties. - Other things are important to me. None that I can think of right now, but I'm sure there's some stuff out there that's important to me. [both laugh] - You are so silly. That's been one of the things that's been hardest for me to resist about you, is your sense of humor. [gentle music] - [Donzelli] Oh shit. - [Tommy] Got it? - Yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it. [Tommy coughs] - Like I was saying, I mean, you're not one of those just out for booty guys like I thought you were. That turned out to be Marco. I've been kind of short with you. I bet you think I've been running around here, the last couple of days, acting like a B-I-T-C-H. - Yeah, yeah, you were, yeah. Hey! - You're not supposed to agree with me. - Well, hey, I wasn't gonna say nothin'. You the one who put it on the table. Shoot. - Well, I'm gonna go up to my room and lay down and try and figure some things out. Can I get you anything before I go? - A condom. [Tommy tuts] I'm just playin', girl. You so fine, I'll hit it bareback. - Oh God, good night. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, now. You said you had some things to think about. What were they? - Well, Marco was supposed to be my partner in catching the Beach Bandit. And it don't really look like that's gonna work out. I was really looking forward to that reward money, too. I need it to help pay for college this coming fall at Pepperdine. - I didn't know you was a brainiac. You in college? - Mm-hmm, business major, going into my sophomore year. - Well, I can use some extra Benjamins. My offer still stands if you want to partner up and catch this foolio. - Okay. - Cool. - If the bandit comes down this way, then you'll be prepared here. And then, you know, if he comes down, like, if you can just set him up or get him down here. And then again, the bird call is essential. Do you remember the bird call that we worked on? Coo-coo! Go to the store. We need a really good wig and like a really good dress. And then, yeah, okay, so I'm gonna wear this whole bum costume. It's a big competition.

[Donzelli grunts] - What's up? - Where you been, Bird? - In the city, in LA, checkin' it out in this sad state of depression I'm in. - Young, black and in college, man, what you depressed for? - Man, I got kicked out of the lifeguard certificate program. Man, the only reason why I even came out here was to lose my virginity. Hell, the ratio of women to men our here is five-to-one. And I still can't score. - You think you got the blues, Bird. I got the blues, 'cause my live-in girlfriend of four years just left me, today. And I know London. I know she ain't comin' back. I know she ain't. - What happened? - London popped up, because of you, man! Man, you told your mama exactly where we was staying at. London came and popped up on me, man, caught me cheatin' with Miranda. - Wait, hold, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa [laughs], I thought you said nothin' happened between you and Miranda. - Well, nothin' happened, but it might as well have happened, man. Man, I can't even blame London, man. I mean, she caught me red-handed. The evidence was thick. - Man, it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. - And you know the thing about it, man, the thing about it is if even if London didn't pop up at my door, I'd have probably did some dirt anyway. - You still gonna hook up with Miranda? - I wish, man. I lost her, too. It's like I lost two birds tryin' to get one bone. - A bird in the hand always beats two in the bush. - Man, what is you, a cliche whore? Then stop that, boo, stop it. - Matter of fact, you the only one that have that bombay Boogie Bash weekend, Donzelli. - Are you kiddin' me, man? I met the girl of my dreams, man, which before I came up here, I didn't even think existed. She hated me. I got her to like me. And now she hates me again. - What she hate you again for? - That's the thing, man. I don't even know. On top of that, my sister's here, thinking I done graduated the lifeguard certificate program, which I didn't even sign up for. On top of that on top of that, I didn't even get to enter my tape in the mixed CD contest, 'cause I ain't have enough money. - I thought you and Tommy caught the Beach Bandit, and y'all got the reward, huh? - We did, man. And I went down there to register today, and said it was too late, man. They had already took in all the submissions, listened to the tapes. Nothing they can do.
