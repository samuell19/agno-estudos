Sometimes when it's really windy, I'd be worried about the roofs coming off. But I don't mind a bit of weather. Raquel and Nora might have different ideas but... I'm alright with it. I trained as a mining engineer and I just do short-term contracts. The rest of the time I'd be doing a couple of surfboards a week. The surfboards is something I enjoy and the mining is something that brings in more money. I came to Clare because there were good waves that I wanted to surf. I remember being really blown away when I first came here and thinking, wow, what a place. When you look down to the sea on a good day and how amazing it is to have it all here on your doorstep. I suppose years ago putting myself in a place where I wanted to be and everything sort of just stemmed from that. Just got to make it work. I was living in the UK. We ended up here in Lahinch for a few days for a surfing trip. I met Tom that week that we were here. I went back to Bristol where I was living and we kept in touch. And one thing led to the other and now we are here! Daddy! < Hello! You're all dirty. Can I've a kiss? Hi. Hello. How's your morning? Good. What did you do? I got two more days of surf boards, being at home and hanging out, and then I'm going the mine for the next two weeks full-time. Yeah. The holiday is over. My life has definitely taken a big change. It's not that I don't enjoy the old life I had surfing and getting paid to do it. She loves looking outside. That's her thing. If she's ever cranky, you just go for a walk with her outside. You love the fresh air. Looking back on your younger self how do you look back on those times? I used to wake up in the morning. I'd check the swell for Australia, Tahiti, Indo... all these places. Me chasing around the world and surfing all the waves, it was kinda, everyone else wanted to do the same thing. I was the lucky guy and they were like, if only I could do that. I had it all. I got the money, had a great time. A jet-set lifestyle and all the good waves. Chasing the professional surfing dream of going around the globe. I just felt like I travel a lot. When do you stop. There should be a quota somewhere. You know, just weighing it all up. I basically just asked myself the big question what can I do. I grew up on an organic farm and you know what, I can grow food. Then it just kind of cut out chasing after energy drink sponsors because that just didn't factor in any more. I'm not broke yet and I'm looking at stretching my money out. It's mad, you've got a family to feed and all that kind of stuff. Being with my girls Sunshine and Sal, this is setting up for the rest of our lives. We have been using this field since a year ago. Very kindly the local landlord let us use it. We just got stuck in and grew us the whole plot with veg last year and it did really well and now we're starting again. Where is it? It was up there. We're in my granddad's shed looking for my first surfboard. Oh Lord. There was other beams here and it was hanging up. So '91 my uncle met a guy on Lahinch promenade and he'd just washed up on the rocks in Lahinch, broken his surfboard. Your man stuffed it in the bin. That next summer my uncle had a board waiting for me. A "new" surfboard. Some guy's old surfboard he'd put back together. So I used that for maybe... until I was about 9 or 10. 4 or 5 summers. Not in a cocky way but people just know who I am from surfing. I've created a good media presence and I want to take advantage of that. When the waves are good, you try and get a photographer to come with you. You get photos in magazines, websites, you get sponsored. You need sponsors to push your profile, to get some money off them, to live. The dream is that you get to a point where they give you a full wage, to be fully sponsored. It's pretty stormy out there. It's the start of a new swell. It's tough going. Some good ones though. It's like having a playground on your doorstep. It's like my playground is the ocean. Make the most of the end of the winter. A couple of months' time I'll be going mad teaching surf lessons. Just down to see the size of the swell. I love seeing the ocean when it's this big. It's crazy. Just looking at it going I wish we could get in for a surf somewhere. But those winds unfortunately are out of control. This time of year Lahinch is very quiet. From after Christmas up until St Patrick's Day not much happens. It's down time for us too in the business so we're a bit more relaxed, we've a bit more time to go surfing ourselves and enjoy it. Myself and John bought a business three days before the storm arrived. Just came down and saw the van in the middle of the car park under 5 foot of water. The van wasn't insured. That was a write-off. It wasn't how I expected to start a new business in the New Year. I'm getting flooded and nearly getting washed into the Atlantic Ocean. During the week this time of the year it's pretty quiet. It's just a bit of a run up to the weekend, you might get people about. Easter is early this year so looking forward to that now, the season kicks off. The bills come in in wintertime as they do in summertime. Unfortunately you can't ring the ESB and go, lads, I'll pay you next July. How's that? It doesn't work that way. You need to make enough to sustain you for the winter period. I always hoped that I could live somewhere where the waves were really good and obviously I've achieved that. But you get to a point where you can't really undo all the decisions that you've made. Your potential to do something different has drifted away. I look at a lot of the people that I used to work alongside. They have fulfilled their potential in that field and I never will now. I suppose you just get that realisation, don't you, that maybe just a feeling that things have slipped by you. But that's alright. You've got to stand by your decisions. This is really, really deep, deep country. When I moved I knew it was going to be hard. I didn't know it was going to be that hard. It's very lonely. And you're really isolated. I have a science background. When I move here, I was hopeful that I was going to find something a little bit chemical. So when that didn't happen, you need to think outside the box. I needed to prove that a move here to live, to make this my life and my home. I wanted Nora to grow up in a very safe place and this is very safe. That's the wave, Aileen's, which is under the Cliffs of Moher. I can still see absolutely remember the wave just wanting to be surfed. A hair's breadth away you've got pain and turmoil and fear. But if you're in the right spot, you can be right beside that and it feels as still and as calm and as right as anything else. That was about five years ago. How many of those moments might be left? Maybe there will come a point and maybe it is already past that you're not going to do it again, which is sad. One of the scariest waves you could possibly imagine. When you paddle out there you're at the will of the ocean. You've given up your powers. It's out of your control. It's really intimidating when you're out there. You're at the base of these cliffs. When big waves come, they hit the reef at a high speed from deep water. You imagine the power that's going to create. A couple of hundred feet of water and it's hitting a 15 foot shelf. All of a sudden it stands up much harder than any other wave I've surfed. It's pretty incredible. You can't just paddle out there and go I'm going to take this on. I'm going to be better than everybody. I'm going to get the best wave, I'm going to ride 5-6 waves in an hour. It doesn't work like that. You have to be patient. You gotta go out there and if it happens it happens. I think that Aileen's challenges you more than any wave in Europe. Four-times overhead wave, that's a massive barrel and you've got to try and take off under the lip of the wave. You've got to go really late. It's crazy. It messes with your head. That's why it's so challenging and so addictive. Being offered the wave of a lifetime and the best natural amphitheatre in the world. Everywhere you look there's danger. If you take off in the wrong spot and the wave hits you the wrong way, who's to know what's going to happen. Around this area I'd be known as The Whale. I do an awful lot of swimming. I used to swim up to the middle of October. This year it was so fine, middle of October, I said I'd keep going until January. I'll try and keep going now for the full year. It's exhilarating. It sets you up for the day. I do a charity swim every year from the lifeguard's box across to Liscannor which is about 2.5 miles. I suppose if you went back 20 years ago, I didn't have to get ready for it at all. It's harder. I'm 60 now. This will be my 43rd swim with the help of God. In my younger days, I'd be first in. Now I'm just glad to get in. It's not a race but they make a race out of it. I just go on my own speed. It's a big part of the summer in Lahinch. Long may it last. It's the thing that gives me the buzz. We're planting our potatoes at long last. Finally the weather has broke. So spuds are getting in the ground. I've a family now and I'm mad to grow veg as a way of life. I haven't flown for coming on two years. Most of my surf companies' sponsorships are up now and that's kinda the end of that game. Rather than having money in my back pocket it's about my own health and my wife and my kid's health. < Do you know, Matt, not even that long ago it used to be the other way around? Like I'd be down there shovelling away and the English man would be telling me what to do. It's nice how times have changed a bit. Hey, it's Good Friday. The pubs are closed but Lahinch Surf School is open. Time to surf. I love these three words. It says "Jesus Loves Peace". I love that. I see that every morning coming to work. That's the good news. Here we go, another day. Another day, another dollar. Here's our first customer coming now. She's getting ready. She's always down for her surf lesson. Morning. We started 2002. It's one of the first surf schools in the west coast of Ireland. There's five surf schools in Lahinch. It's a small area to work in. God saves if you put Him first, He'll look after everything else, and that works. It's miraculous and it's amazing that it works. There's three lads and a girl. They've never surfed before. Never? Never. Germans. < They'll be efficient. Like the Irish. Stags, half an hour late. "Didn't know where it was, lads." Back to the grind. It's always really nice to have that quiet time but then you're craving a bit of energy in the town after a while. It's time for everyone to make their bread. You've never surfed before? No. Good. That's the best way to be. Lots to learn. It's the first weekend of the year, so everyone is excited, and we're excited too. It's been a long winter, lads, a long winter. Lots of people around, just a bit of a buzz going on, just feels like the start. The winter is long and the bank balance scrapes the bottom of the barrel. You know there's always a question mark, will it work this year, has anything changed? So a weekend like this and you realise the sun is going to come out people are going to come to Lahinch. If it was like this every weekend, ah we'd be millionaires. What's tomorrow actually? It's picking up for Wednesday, anyway. Look at Thursday, 1.7 metres. We'll have to get the sign up that says "gone surfing, closed". Oh, I see the surf forecast for Wednesday now, it looks really nice, wow! My 40 year old condition for surfing big waves is not there at the moment, but stages in life, you know. It's great to just put down the big wave surf board for now, for a while. Over the past 3 years, it's been hectic. Kids priority, church priority, surfing very much just drops off. At age 40, yeah, you lose your sharpness for sure. It's been such a nice few days, I haven't even been in Lahinch. I tend to avoid it when it's a Bank Holiday weekend and the sun is out. You kind of know it's there, and you know the madness is down there. It's so close, but you can avoid looking for parking spaces, and things like that. Much nicer when it's kind of windswept and quiet. Which one, the orange one? This one. That one? Yeah. Okay. So, watch out. You carry that. Come on. Hey, that needs to come with me. No come on, put it in the car and we'll get another one. In it goes. There we go! There. So, yeah, tomorrow there's going to be a lot of swell, and it's going to be really clean and organised. It's not that funny. So yeah, lots of swell, if it's too big, it's going to be a bit scary. This is in my bag of tricks. Do you want to hold them? You wear this under your wet suit, and if you're having a hard time under water, it fills with air and you float. Probably won't need it, but I'm trying to get to grips with using it, because I don't fancy being held... I've had some nasty experiences, and I don't want any more. You can definitely psyche yourself out for sure, but, the main thing to remember is that as soon as you get in the sea down there and start paddling, you're kind of focussed on what you're doing, and you forget about it all. Although, to date I have psyched myself out, to the point where I've just walked away. See you out there. People live in this area, people have moved here just for Aileens. People come from all over the world just to surf there. When there's a clean ground swell, it's kind of nice huh? Yeah, wintertime is great for waves, but it's actually the spring/autumn when you've settled weather, and then if you get a swell, they're the best conditions. Shane Dorian's probably the most progressive big wave surfer that's ever lived. He's like the Messi or Ronaldo of surfing. He's one of those iconic figures that everyone respects. It's still cold for me. This is balmy. This isn't even like Ireland. I can't believe this place though. It's like you're in a movie here. It's such a trip! Aileen's would be the biggest challenge for me. I probably won't ever surf a wave that I find as hard to surf. If you've caught an amazing wave, you definitely feel validated, that you do have something to offer. Like making a wave like that, I'd be buzzing for days! When it's all over, that will be sad. When you start deciding that you can't surf there any more. I'm under no illusions that I'm extremely lucky to be here. Usually when you have all this anticipation, you're let down, and it was overwhelming. It was even better than I thought. The wave was incredible. It's so neat to be able to surf a session like that and then have another session to go. For me, being in Ireland for just a few days, I'm pretty excited to see as much as I can of the country, so, let's go check it out. I think it's probably my favourite wave in the world. The whole thing, walking down the cliffs and paddling out there. It's just incredible. The energy there is crazy. I think you need a higher level of surfing. I think you'd need to be technically a lot better to surf Riley's than you do to surf Aileen's. Much more dangerous. Riley's breaks from knee to waist-deep water. That can be pretty crazy. Taking off on a wave that has enough power to break you in half. The risks of Riley's are just crazy but the reward is pretty amazing. I'm more worried about the wind. It's pretty windy, but it looks nice. No, it's OK. I thought it was going to be bad too, and the wind is going to drop a lot. Oh, my God! That's so much bigger than it looks as well. Huh? It's so much bigger than it looks. Yeah? Is it good? That's the whole thing. Is it going to be good? Amazing. Just oh my God! We've just got to pick the right waves and Yeah? Oh man This is as good as I think it's as good at that size as it gets. It's pretty incredible, I mean I knew Shane Dorian would love this spot. Surfing the middle of my local wave. And he's respecting you on it, this is mind-blowing, you know. That was pretty special. Just perfect waves and a good crew of people. The plan is to go and eat some really good food with my girlfriend and try not to tell her how crazy the waves were! Oh it's the perfect temperature, isn't it, Sunshine? Hi! Hi! We've put a lot of work into this field and it's in really good condition now, but it's their land and I always knew that. We had no long-term agreement, they want to take it back. You know we're out of the field? You said something to me about that, yeah, what happened there? Nothing really, just business. They want it back. Was that okay with you? At first it seemed bad, but actually it's the best thing ever. Time to quickly move on. Focus on where you want to be? Yeah. Give that your energy rather than giving your energy to something that may be that was temporary anyway Which was going to go anyway. It was always going to go at some stage so, rather than Now you can give your energy to something without having to worry about is it going to be taken away from me. Totally. We're mid-packing. We'll be living up the hill, shortly. We're buying this land up there. We're starting a place we're going to have forever. I kind of had the realisation today, if we want food next year of our own, we've got to get busy. A whole new patch of land again. Getting the land taken off us was quite a sad story because, what will I do? I need land to grow food. We've gone looking to get a piece of land and we'll move on to our own garden, and start something for the long term. Yeah, it is a bit frustrating when lots of people put work into something and then it gets stopped. So capital S Summer. What are we getting today? We are getting our Summer Holidays! There's lovely waves out there today. Yeah, and the water's warm. Ah, you see! You weren't expecting that, were you? Cool. Excellent, girls. You look fabulous. She said, ""ell Andy I said goodbye"" She's into you, man. You see, it's amazing what a bit of sunshine does. Brilliant! Surfing has become a massive part of Lahinch, a massive part of the economy which wasn't there before when I was growing up. If you saw 10 cars down on the promenade at a weekend, that would be a lot of cars. At that stage, even to get a bar of wax was impossible in the West of Ireland. People used the wax from the outside of cheese and melted it down to put on their boards. It was a real wild scene for me as a youngster, looking at it, to see these guys with their long hair and their beautiful tans and beautiful women hanging on to them. You'd see these guys coming in, big hairy devils and you know it's great craic I suppose. It wouldn't have been the norm back then. Never having seen surfing before it was like, ""hat the hell are they doing?""you know. People in the locality were a bit wary of surfers. When I was growing up the massive part of the economy was, the Irish people that came to play golf. Now you don't have as much of that as you used to have. When I was in school, nobody surfed. Probably I'd say around 2000 it started to change, and then the advent of the surf schools which really brought an extra dimension to the town. Yeah, it's brought a lot of people, I think, to live in the place. There's lots of young people around, which keeps us all young. If you go down there today, you could see maybe 200 people in the water? It's really boosted the economy locally. They're part of the community. We've to fit in with them now rather than them fitting in with us, you know. It's fantastic to see any progression in sport. It's great to see these Irish lads surfing to that standard. I'm lucky enough that, when I was growing up, we had a very strong collective group of talented surfers, the first real high-level group of surfers in Ireland. Now I have the young bucks, especially young Dylan here sitting in the back. He's not too far behind now, if I'm honest. Trying to, I suppose take over the mantle. Watch this on the inside here, down here. Look. You know, as much as I want Shane Dorian to come over here and surf our waves, I think it would be a lot nicer to have someone from Lahinch on the front cover of surf magazines, making a living travelling the world. I want the kids from Lahinch to surf around the world and be like, 'I'm from Lahinch, I'm from County Clare, I'm from Ireland'. I want Lahinch to be the place where everyone goes, 'Wow, the guys from Lahinch they surf big waves and they charge.'. We're gonna start from the cliffs and it's my first time and it's the most scared I've ever been in my life. Nice to get a day where it's nice size waves so we can take a wave and go, 'This is your wave' and make him go. LAUGHS CHEERING Amazing. Just happy I got pushed to go out there. Dreamy, a dream wave. Off we go. Wee! Whoa. OK. Now, watch out, because these bits of stone are going to go flying. Come on! That'll do. LAUGHS Hard to keep the fitness up. I think I surfed once in May, two or three times so far in June. So yeah, the surf has been pants, is the technical expression. I'm sure the world will turn, and until then it'll be building walls and building extensions, so it's good for that sort of stuff. These are our rough plans to start with. Raquel is due now the end of November. It seems to be what people do, actually, is as soon as there's a child or another child on the way, they panic and go for the big nest building event. It's just graph paper and pencil lines at the moment. Yeah, it's a bit daunting. Ok, girls, are you ready for action? I'm going to get you boots and we're going to do the hot water into the boots. This is I don't think they have to do this in Australia, you know. Deirdre, how's it going? Listen, I think we'll have to cancel tomorrow, OK? Cos there's a bit of a storm coming tonight and tomorrow, the winds are really strong and it's a massive swell. This is the 5th time this last month we've closed, you know, because of the winds. It's the same again for next weekend at the moment like, you know. It's just, what a disaster. It's really killing us down here. Oh, another mammy disappointed because she can't get rid of the kids for an hour or two hours. We need this thing, called the sun. Anyone seen it? Please return it to Lahinch. Are you dancing on the Happy baby! Happy mum? You smell nice. Thank you. This is agricultural land and we're not allowed planning permission, so if we make a portable home, if we have to move it we can move it. I'd love to build a lovely warm house, but that's a whole different ball game of money and planning and all that stuff. So we're looking forward to the simplicity. Excited to give it a go, more just as an adventure. Can we climb in? I've never owned a home. One month that we've owned this piece of land. It's a lovely feeling, because we can actually look after and hopefully make tribe and it's just the beginning and here's to an epic adventure on the land. Woo! On the land! This is glorious, isn't it? We haven't had this you know, in about a month and a half. How are you? We're doing the swim on Sunday for the Burren Chernobyl Children across the bay to Liscannor. You're on for a tenner here. Thanks a million. Are you well? Ah sure keeping the bright side out. That's The Falls, will we go to the priest? I couldn't live outside Lahinch. I mean I'm mad about the sea. This year is the first year in the last 10 years that I've went in every day. Aren't ye brave men? So ye're looking for a few bob? Anything at all, yeah. Thanks very, very much. In 1972 we decided we'd do a swim for the local hospital. The first few years, I was a young fellow, I was 18 or 19, fifty minutes. Usually for me now it's between an hour and twenty and an hour and a half and I'd have to do three months training to actually be able to do it now. Oh, Jesus! I mightn't be able to run a half-a-mile but I'd swim a couple of miles for you. It doesn't matter. I have 15 there. That's perfect, thank you very much. Thanks a million, Maura. People kind of look at me and they say, 'What's he doing?' But I just, I just love it. Oh, Chits, 'tis yourself! How are you? I'm after making paupers out of the whole lot of them! Thanks a million, thanks a million. I'll see you on Sunday. Yeah. If you've got the energy we'll have a Oh, we'll be having a jar in Liscannor. Thanks a million, Christie. Thanks. There you are. We were all at the pitch and putt there and he said there's a very bad day promised Sunday, so it could be rough. This will be my first year doing it at 60 years of age. Very proud of myself. Course, I haven't it done yet. Enjoy guys. Rip it up. The instructors get tired as August rolls through. It is nice, you've kind of got a deadline to aim for. The 1st of September. It kind of turns into a leisurely pace. It's just like everything is so for family life that's the best time of the year. Late summer, you can feel it. It'll be a big change here next Monday in Lahinch. Once school's back that's it, the season starts really, really winding down. I compare it month to month from year to year, so I do. I look at last year's books and take a look at this year's books, just for our own records, so we know in what way we're kind of up and down, you know. This year, July was like we're down about 40 percent on July this year. It's not a good situation to be in. You just go, 'Right, close up shop for the day, that's it, no income'. It's a long season. Come March, April, the funds are really, really low you know, so... You're looking for the special offers in Aldi then so you are. You're definitely going for the Aldi specials. Ladies and gentlemen, the 43rd Annual Sponsored Charity Swim by Pat Conway, Brian McCarthy and friends from Lahinch to Liscannor in aid of the Burren Chernobyl Project will take place in approximately 20, 25 minutes. Are you going into it? Is it rough enough? Oh, tis rough enough. Rough enough for me. I heard someone when I was going up there, three fellows, 'One of the fellas doing it, he's 80!' I said, 'No! Sixty.' I said. Only sixty. That's my first grandson, yeah CHEERING The sea is my life. In 1972, I was lifeguard down here. I started swimming from Lahinch to Liscannor. Then I decided I'd go a bit longer and I'd try from Doolin to the Arran Islands. And then I got it into my head I'd try it over and back. And then started training to do the English Channel, because I had this dream in my head of landing onto the beach in Calais. In 1980 I got within three-and-a-half miles of France. I decided I'd give it another go. The second year I was about 700 yards from France, I could see the beach, I could see the people and I was into a little bay like Lahinch bay. I just got completely shattered mentally and physically. I'd met a wall half way across it, I'd say this was a full wall and roof. I was gone! Just gone. They tried everything from the boat, handing me out a brandy, but I just couldn't. I gave up and that was the end. That was, I suppose that was a big disappointment in my life, really. I felt that for a while afterwards. APPLAUSE CHEERS Howiya. This is the last year this year. Never say never. It's something that I'm very attached to, and I hope that when I finish doing it, my daughters and my son will keep it going. I think he's a Conway, Pat. Huh? He's a Conway. Ah, he said he wouldn't chance it this year. Next year maybe. It was actually, even though I was last in, it was a bit quicker than I expected. Pat, I bailed out. Thanks for letting me do it though. Did you enjoy it? Loved it, loved it. Good man yourself! Next year, with the help of God. Definitely. Good man yourself. Well done. I said after 40 years I was going to stop, this is the 43rd. Bonus years now, yeah, but still, 50 sounds good, doesn't it? GIGGLES Dad? Mm? What time is it? Nearly time to go, Nor. Dad, don't forget my bag. We won't forget it. We could do that. We have to feed the cats as well. I'm tired. LAUGHS That's a great way to start. No it's better like that Come on then, Nors. September is usually pretty much our best month or two now, September, October for waves. So a nice time of the year when it's all changing. Feeling good. Excited, I suppose. The season's winding down and October onwards is when the waves start to kick in. Stop thinking about doing lessons and more about our own surfing. Hopefully at this stage we've made a nice chunk of cash to subsidise us for the winter. I mean, over the entire summer you could be in the water every day except for 3 or 4 days. You get very, very tired from it. I kind of feel like I should be doing it myself. You know, I wanna hold me own school and make my own life from that, you know. I think, late teens, early 20's that would have never been on my mind. The only thing that was on my mind was how far can I push myself, can I get the sponsors to allow me to live the lifestyle I want to live? And I was able to do that for a few years, but you know, you come to a point I think as a sponsored surfer, semi professional, you know, little bit of money, a little bit of coaching, we get our lessons, I think you come to a point where you realise that there has to be a long term plan. There has to be some kind of longevity there. You have to be realistic. You know, in 10 years time I might not be as into big wave surfing. I might have a couple of children or be off somewhere else in the world. How long can you really keep surfing those waves without getting hurt? How long can you keep the passion for doing crazy things if the money isn't there? You have to go and find a sustainable way to live, you know. That's just reality. I still have aspirations of like reliving the dream and getting back out to the cliffs of Moher and catching that wave so, lately I've started to dream about getting back, getting back to the wave and getting back to enjoy surfing. So that's yeah, definitely after three or four years bringing up babies, there's a new season now to kind of catch a wave again. OK, here we go. Boots boots are there. It's Romans 12 verse 6 and it says, 'Having gifts then let us use them.' And so that's what God put on my heart that, OK, I have the gift of surfing. If he can use it for some way, I get back on my surfboard. It was great to get into surfing at a young age. I just loved the motion, the feeling of it. That's it, you get your first good wave and you're hooked for life. Throughout my teenage years, as I started to win surf contests, there was a claim in it for me. You have an opportunity to be on the front cover of a magazine, 'Wow, this is who I am.' I would have been all about surfing, all about living the dream. But there's the moments where you're alone and silent and it's like, 'OK, well, what's life about? Who am I? Where am I going?' I need answers for the deepest part of me. I was there in Australia aged 30 and I started reading these spiritual books. When I read about Jesus I was like, 'Wow, OK, there's something beautiful about this'. You could call it a paradigm shift. Everything changes. It's a cleaning of the board. That's when life restarts. It's a new beginning. That was the most important day of my life. Here we go. That's one. There's one there. I have a lot of old bog deal in the ground here. Unfortunately, as much as I'd love to leave it there, it's not going to be very easy to grow a garden around all these tree stumps so, we've kind of made a total shit of the place. We've a whole lot of repairing to do and I don't even know the best way to do that in the end. The main pressure for me right now is that it's October and, hallelujah, the weather's good, but it's going to break. He's done half of it. We've got half to go. Then we wanna get our green manure sown and.. There's a list of jobs to do. This is quite tiring to do. I seem to get migraines. It's being rundown and I was sick there last weekend. I actually couldn't stand up. I was like dizzy. And like delirious. It was just like a defence mechanism. My body telling me to just stop. So I just lay down. Cos there's so much just coming in. Juggling the digger and trying to get the tunnel up. Trying to build our yurt. I do get stressed. It's hard work this. This having a baby, having a family, trying to live in a yurt. It is hard work, trying to make a life for yourself when you're starting from scratch. Well it works, it fits. So now, in terms of the timbers for up above, how far out does that come? Move back. Either move your hand forward or move your belly back. That's it. Finished! Finished the top one. Now do the next line. Finn is getting up! Well done. Things are going alright. Busy. We sort of seem to be slipping straight into winter again without a pause for Autumn. Everything's all go. And Rachael getting bigger by the day. I can see Nora slowly changing. Dropping her in the morning in the beginning, she was kind of hiding behind me a little bit. And every day she kinda goes a step farther. To see that independence coming out is quite good. Seeing her being grown up and growing up, is amazing. I have a mental list. That I keep ticking. Work and house and Nora and the baby. It's a lot. A lot, a lot. No, I can't. It's too early. I need two more months. I'm not ready for this yet. I have too much to do. That whole section has 210 internal. So that's more like 300. Nora! How are you? Did you have a good day? Yeah. What you been up to? School, school, school. School stuff. You're probably just naturally responding to different periods of your life. I wouldn't want to be chasing it around now because I'm in family mode. And nesting mode. You need to be surfing within ten minutes of your house really. I'm checking the surf because we're hoping that the Cliffs of Moher is gonna break this weekend. This Saturday. So it would be great if it does break. I think it's been three years since I've surfed it properly. I guess I've been in the pool twice a week so, I'm relatively fit. For this surf, I knew the waves were gonna be big. If you get scared, you're finished. I had fear in my heart so I'm just like going okay. I am out here to catch waves. I got a big wipe-out. That was the first time in years experiencing what the white-water does. Boof. It hits you. When I was underneath the water, okay, stay calm. One, two, three, four, five. And you're still going. I got back out and I got a loan of a bigger board. Okay, am I supposed to be here? Do I want to be here? I really clearly felt the Lord say to me, John, you just need to stay talking to me. And so I started slowly. I just caught a really small wave. But then I got a pretty big wave and that went well. Then it's like here comes a really big one. I said Lord, please bless this wave and down I go. When the biggest, best wave of the day came, I was talking to God as I was paddling. I was like, Lord, will you bless this wave. It was one of the best waves of my life. Surfing is very much back in the picture now. This is who I am. I'm a surfer. I like to surf big waves. So this is just part of my life. It's a long day in the yurt. Just non-stop. Wind and rain. It's tiring. Whoa. It's a bad winter but we had a terrible summer as well. Last Saturday, there was enough rain in one day than there usually is in a month. And it had been saturated and waterlogged before that as well. And then since that it's kept raining. We haven't really had any let-up. If we don't get a good spring, it's gonna be really difficult to do anything. Trying to alleviate the water after some heavy rain. Seeing where water is gathering and trying to make sure it doesn't sit for too long. We're in the middle of a wet field with stones everywhere. Which ain't making us any money. Will we see vegetables this time next year here? Feels like we're a long way from it at the moment, when you're filling holes with sods of rushes and there's lakes and stones everywhere. But time will tell. Yeah. We had lessons booked in for November. We had to cancel. Massive storms and winds. Normally we are open this time of the year. But we've been closed for the last 6 weeks. It hasn't been the best year, unfortunately. It is hard when you're working for yourself and you have a family. If things go belly up in the surf school, I can always go back to the carpentry. I'd rather not. I like the surfing. It's what we do, y'know. You gotta constantly adapt the business. Thinking of new ideas. Advanced lessons, bringing people forward with people who have knowledge. I think there's only the one fella so far in town who can say he can do that and that's Ollie. Now we have to create a culture or proper coaching. Not this grab a board, off I go. That's terrible like. That's what happened for years. I see 'em on the prom the whole time. They go, I'm doing this for so long, I wanna go further. But how do I? You can do assessments. You go out with them and go, you go surfing, I'll watch you. Progression is the word. That's what people want to hear. They want to hear that they're going to progress. I want to be the guy that everyone goes to... Yeah. To progress their surfing. And I wanna do it with you and become synonymous with proper coaching. I think that's the way forward. It has to be. Two years from now, there's gonna be a whole bunch of little kids. To have a proper little grom. And you feel actually in the water.. There's no point us going right, we've done our surfing. Where's the next crew? Then it goes back to square one. They're on their own. I have huge pride in Lahinch. I want it to be the place where top surfers are born and bred. Ireland has this terrible mediocrity complex. We can be as good as any other place in the world. It should be the same in every sport. And it's to instil that in the next generation of kids. If you work a little bit at something, you can get places like. Who was meant to be doing the painting? You. And Nora. We'll get Nora on it in sec. There's only so many things you can do, isn't there. Exactly. There's only 24 hours in a day. And I've been witness to most of those 24 hours over the last little while. We were just sitting down to dinner. Rachael was like, I think I'm having contractions. It took us a record breaking one hour to get to Galway, as the contractions got more and more painful for Rachael. What happened with the police? So we got stopped by the guards. I'd secretly been hoping that I was gonna get pulled. With having the best excuse in the world for floggin' it through the town at 90. I got to use the immortal lines - "My wife's in labour!" He's so sweet. I think he's easier because we are loads more relaxed. We know what we are doing. Sorts anyway. < Little man. Is he asleep? He's just chillin'. Everything else has to carry on regardless. When we were doing this with you, Nor, it was like the whole world stopped. But now that we're doing it with Dustin, we have to keep on doing everything else. Yeah. It's amazing that children bring something within you that nothing else does. I don't know. It just brings something out from you that you really didn't know it was there. We haven't had it easy. We're actually progressing nicely. I always think weather and things like this are always just tests to see if you're gonna... have you got it in you. Preparing a bed to plant garlic. It likes to cold, it likes the frost. Yeah, it's a big like... first of the whole project. This is it. This is the first crop of the year. First seeds. So it's nice just to be starting. Kind makes you think that ain't that long away 'til we'll be harvesting. Won't be long. Where are we going to get the tree? Over we go! I want to get a big tree. That's a bit better. Let's take it then. I've been in Clare for long enough now that putting down roots is done. It feels as home as anywhere. Ta-da! So it needs a bit of pruning. It's lovely. I helped him carry it in. Thanks for your help, Nor. This is our main sanctuary for these Christmas events. We open up the whole hall. How you doin'. Big waves, surfing. It's very much back on the cards now. I feel it's just the start of something that God is doing. I don't know what it is yet but we'll just keep going by faith. Look at that big, dirty crumble on the edge of it. And look a t this thing. Look how wide this one's going. Fuck sake. My God. Happy Christmas everybody. Woo-hoo! We're blessed. We've got incredible waves. The place is incredible. I don't want it to just be left there. I want the people of Ireland and the people of the world to know that the waves are amazing here. And the guys here surf really good. RTE 2019
