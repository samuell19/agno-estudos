Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Oh, boy! Boy, what a day. It's ten minutes after ten. - Phil! - Uh? Call up the paper and tell them we've got a story for the front page. Ten minutes after ten and Lulu ain't come to work yet. - Is that news? - It's something to write home about. I've been waiting eight years... ...for that girl to come late and now it's happened. Maybe she's got spring fever like you have. Lulu? She couldn't get any kind of fever. If there had been a wedding this morning, I'd understand it. She ain't missed a wedding in years. - Yes, she has. - Whose? Her own. Here she comes now. Old lady four eyes! Old lady four eyes! Lulu, do you know what time it is? Springtime. Clickety-click, clickety-click, clickety-click... I wish I owned this library! _ Why? - Because I'd get an axe... and smash it to a million pieces. Then I'd set fire to the whole town and play ukelele while it burned. What are you drawing all your money out for, investment? Yes. I hope you're not going into the stock market. No. Then what are you going to invest your money in? A vacation. You mean to tell me you're going to spend $1,242,68 for... Yes! - How long do you expect to be gone? - About two weeks. - Where? - Some place where they don't know me. - Lulu Smith, that's idiotic. - It' silly. - It's ridiculous. - It's insane, but I'm going to do it. - Why? - Just because. - Good evening. - Two, please. - Emil, two. - Two? Par ici, s'il vous pla?t. Good evening, madam. Two? No... no, one. One? - Emil, one. - One? One. S'il vous pla?t. Oh... um... - Uh... I'll take everything. - Yes, madam. Two days out and still one. This boat she's not what she used to be. - Emil! - Oh, pardon. Hello. - What are you doing in my room? - What are you doing in my room? In your room? Isn't this 99? Not quite, it's 66. Sixty-six? Oh me, oh my. Or oh my, oh me, as you prefer, because I'm upside down again. You know, I've been upside down ever since I've been on the boat. I'll say... I owe you an apology. Let's see, 99... 66... Thirty-three apologies, to be exact. - Will you forgive me? - Certainly. - Thirty-three times. - Thank you for understanding. Oh, you see? Ninety-nine and sixty-six. If I had walked on my hands I'd have been alright, woudn't I? Well... do you think you'll be alright now? I'm sure that I will, thank you. Come in. I beg your pardon. I didn't want you to think... That is... I've never done anything like this before. I mean, get fizzed up and stray into a strange room. Will you forgive me? It's quite alright. You see, I'm on my vacation. - Are you on your vacation? - Yes. You know, I haven't had a holiday in a long, long time. You know, nose to the grindstone and all that sort of thing... It sort of went to my head. Have you ever had your nose to the grindstone? Oh, I beg your pardon. Then you really do forgive me? Really. You're not just being polite? No. Oh, look, I mussed up your bed. Well, at least I wasn't under the bed, was I? Do I look like an out-and-out drunkard to you? No, not out-and-out. But would you say that I was fairly sober now? Fairly. Well, pardon me for being personal... but as long as I was straying into somebody's room, I'm glad it was yours. I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever met. Good night. Hello. Hello, is this 66? Well, this is 99 calling. I just wanted to let you know that I got home safely. Oh, congratulations. Thank you. The trouble now is how to find the dining-room. I never could do it without a partner. Have you had your dinner? Well, I, er... No, I... I was just going. Oh, that's fine. I'll be in the gutter in front of your door. Will you pick me up on the way? - One, madam? - No, two. Two? Emil, two. Two? Two. Vive la France! Par ici, s'il vous pla?t. Fa?tes vos jeux, monsieurs, mesdames. Fa?tes vos jeux. What number are you betting on this time? I'm betting on you, 99. Rien ne vas plus. But there is no number 99. I know, but I bet on 33 three times. - Number 33 wins. - Oh, good, I won! 33 again. - Aren't you lucky. - Oh, look at all that. I hope I haven't bored you with all this talk about politics. I haven't heard anything but that music. It's funny how you open up sometimes and talk. I guess it's because I've got a worm. What do you mean a worm? Surely, people without worms never amount to much. Of course, some people call them dreams and others call them ambitions. But I call them worms, you know why? Because they gnaw, and gnaw inside of you and keep you on the go. You know what I mean? Sure, I know. What's your pet worm? You are. Then don't you step on me. Because after I get to become president of the United States, the worm will turn. Oh, don't be president. It's much more fun here. Do you want to know something, 66? If I were an architect instead of a lawyer... Yes? and could draw the plans for the kind of girl who'd suit the kind of guy I am... Yes? You'd be it. And do you know something? Do you want to know what I really came to Havana for? What? To meet you. Don't you think it's about time we gave our right names? You don't know anything about me. Well... Have you ever beaten your mother? Not with a club. - Or strangled little children? - None under the age of five. Well, that's all I want to know. Here's to you, 66. Right back at you, 99. - I would be, except for one thing. - What's that? - The boat sails tomorrow. - Oh, why bring that up? - Why can't we stay here? - You mean for another week? - Another century. - But what would we live on? Worms. We could be beachcombers. Boy! Speck! Give me the clippings on "What a Man". - Who? - What a Man. Clippings on What a Man. Alright, 99. But can't you get there before 9 o'clock for once? Well, I have a surprise for you. Lots of them. Yeah. Alright. But don't be any later, will you? Alright... bye, dear. Good morning, teacher. What would you do for that? I'd go for it, Al. Tell me. Did you ever hear of a lawyer named Robert Collins? Lawyer? Collins? Never heard of him. Where did he tend bar? Or do I see love rearing its ugly head? No. I just couldn't find any clippings on him, that's all. I know you didn't give me this apple for nothing. - So, what? - Well, in a word, I'll tell you. See, I was repairing my typewriter, fixing the letter "i", when it suddenly dawned on me today's payday. Ergo, I eat. "Alone?", I says. "Phooey", says I. And who do you think I thought of? Who do you think I thought of? You. What do you say? - No. - Tomorrow night? - Next year? - No. Good. Because by me it's this way. The longer they no, the harder they yes. Please, Mr. Holland. You s...! - Hello, Mr. Holland. - That's all right. - You're a mean old thing. - Oh, what's an apple core for? Oh, is that so? Listen here, young lady, you're gonna wake up some fine morning... ...and find yourself married. And it'll be my big shoes you'll find... Ah! Come on, kids, let's go over to Fred's. Come in. What is it? Oh! Wooo... there's a wolf at the door and sees clothing. - Who are you? - I'm the census taker. Oh, I lost my senses long ago. Good, then I'll come in. What's your name? How many children have you got in this house? - What's your father's name? - Did you bring me one? - Give it to me! - How old is your son? How old is your father? How old is your mother? Say, you look awful! Strange and alluring. I love you, I adore you. You are the most beautiful flower in this lovely garden. What have you got to eat? Oh, I live only for you, my prince, my hero. - Kippers, you pig. - Kippers? English kippers? - Out of my way, slave. - Hey, keep out of there! Oh, let me alone. Come on, let me fix the flowers. - Say, what are we celebrating anyway? - Your victory in court today. What victory? Well, I didn't see it in the papers, but you won your case, didn't you? - Did I ever lose a case? - Did you follow my advice? If I say no, you'll get sore, and if I say yes, you'll get conceited. - Did you do what I told you to do? - I'll tell you after the potatoes. - You'll tell me right now. - No, I'll tell you after the kippers. You'll tell me now, because I have some news too, but you tell me yours first. - I'm not interested. - Oh, but you will be. It's a secret. It's awfully important. But you gotta tell me about yourself first. The Cardinals beat the Cubs today ten to seven. Tell me yours first and I'll tell you mine. Did you handle the case the way I told you? Did you win? Come on, tell me! Wait, wait! Yes, yes, I won. I did just as you told me. Now cut it out, you roughneck. See? There, didn't I tell you if you did as I... Listen, foolish. Are you happy? At times. What times? What times when I'm with you. Then I'm not only happy, I'm sappy. A hundred percent? Did you ever read the story of Cinderella? I wrote it. Then you remember that Cindy had a complex. And at the time she was happiest and sappiest... she was most afraid. Afraid of what? The stroke of twelve, don't you remember? That's when poor little Cindy had to stop being a princess... ...and go back to her attic. It's never going to strike twelve for us, is it, Bob? Ah-ha, the stroke of twelve. Please don't answer it. I have to. It might be the prince for little Cindy. Are you there? Am I there? Ha, I'll say I'm there. It isn't the prince. Say, listen. In the last ten or fifteen minutes I've decided to ask you to marry me. What do you say? Say that again. I said in the last ten or fifteen minutes I've decided to ask you to marry me. What do you say? Well, I'll think it over for ten or fifteen years. Alright with me, take your time. I'll hold the wire. I'll have to see my lawyer about it. I have a good one. Okay, see you in court. Alright, bye-bye. - Who was that? - A reporter on the paper. How well do you know him? Well enough to have him ask me to marry him. But I told him I'd have to see my lawyer about it. What have you got to say about that? Yeah. Well, aren't you going to advise me about marriage? Well? Dear, I can't advise you about marriage. Well, I guess I'll have to find myself another lawyer. Hey, you. Hey, you with the funny nose. What's the matter? Dear, you know that I love you, don't you? Yes. That's all I ever want to know. Haven't you ever been curious about me, or... wondered who I am, or... wondered why you never saw my name in the papers, or... You don't have to explain anything, Bob. Dear, I can't explain anything. Lulu, deep down in your heart... ...you know that you're the only woman I ever loved. You've got to believe that, you do, don't you? Yes. Well, my name isn't Collins. It's Grover, Bob Grover and... and I'm married. Oh, I know what you're thinking, but you can't despise me... ...any more than I despise myself. If I have any excuse it's... it's that I love you. Up to now I've been too much of a coward, but dear... Listen, I want to do the right thing. Are you living together? Yes, we are. Oh, dear, I'm awfully sorry. I meant to tell you before. I don't know why I kept putting it off. On the boat, on the way home, even in Havana I meant to tell you. But somehow I couldn't. I was afraid of losing you. I know. I wanted to ask you too, but I was afraid. I knew there was something wrong. I guess we'll have to blame it... on palm trees, or something. We can't blame it on the palm trees, we've got to blame it on me. I'm the one that's to blame. What are we going to do now, Bob? Dear, I don't know. I'm trying, I... I don't know. I want to do whatever's right. I'll keep on loving you no matter what happens. What will happen, Bob? Well, dear, I can't leave her. You... you love her, don't, you? No, dear, not the way I love you That isn't the point. But divorce is out of the question. Why? Oh, dear, it's awfully tough to talk about. You see... She's an invalid. The car turned over while I was driving and... She's on my hands. She always will be, Lulu. But she's such a good sport, you see. That's what makes it so... Well, anyway, I can't leave her. I see. That is kind of... Oh, but Bob, that doesn't mean we're through, does it? Look, if I never see her I can pretend she doesn't even exist. - That'll be better than nothing. - Oh, sweet, that'll be worse than nothing. But you can't leave me, Bob, not now! You mustn't! - Dear, I must. It wouldn't be fair to you. - Oh, that doesn't make any difference. Don't you understand? You can't leave me! Dear, I can't offer you marriage and I won't offer you anything else. What do you want me to do, get down on my knees? Now Lulu, darling, please. You say you love me, then why don't you do something about it? I haven't asked any question because I could answer every question. I haven't lied, I'm not married. But, dear, I've tried to explain that my wife... Your wife, what do I care about your wife? Don't you see I'm trying to do the right thing for you? Right thing, right thing! Alright, go ahead, be noble. - Here's your hat! Go home to your wife! - Lulu! You say you want to do the right thing, well, why don't you? You're using a lot of high words but what do they all amount to? You've had your fun and you're fed up. That's all right with me! Get out! Lulu, if you ever need anything... Yes, sure, I know! Here... here they come. Folks, here they come. - Will you kindly step outside a moment? - Yes, ma'am. You can all go back in a little while. I just wanted to make sure there was no mistake. - He looks just like you, Tom. - No kidding. You sure, just like me? Doesn't he, Mother? Say, nurse, have I had my baby yet? Will you please go to the office on the second floor? - What floor is this? - This is the third floor. Oh, gee! No. She doesn't want to see it. I just saw your baby. It's beautiful. Wouldn't you like to see it? I wonder if you feel strong enough to answer a few questions. What about? What are you going to call the baby? Roberta. The mother's name? Jane Doe. Wouldn't you rather give your real name? Jane Doe. And the father's name? District Attorney's office. Sorry, that case doesn't come up until tomorrow morning. Tell the DA I'll wait just one minute longer. Then he'll have to come to see me. Mr. Holland says he'll wait just one more minute. Then you'll have to come and see him. You tell Holland to use his own judgment. - Oh, I'm fed up! - But you've been working so hard lately. Why don't you take a rest? You know what the doctor said. Dear, I don't care what the doctor said. The doctor's a fool. All doctors are fools. Simply because you don't turn handsprings they say something's the matter with you. Why don't you go with me to Vienna? Dear, I'd love to, but you're going away for treatments and you'll be gone for months. Mr. Murphy. No, and I don't want ever to see Mr. Murphy. Darling, wouldn't it be marvelous... ...if I really came back cured this time? You're great just as you are. The only trouble with you is that you worry too much about me. Well, one invalid in the family is enough. Oh. I don't like to hear you talk that way. You're great. You'll be jumping over fences the first thing you know. And don't you worry about me now. I'll take care of myself alright. Bob. While I'm away, I... I want you to have a good time. And I won't ask too many questions either. Just for that, I'll be home for dinner tonight. Good! - Goodbye, dear. - Goodbye. Hello, Holland. Make it snappy. Miss Jones, have those witnesses wait, I'll only be a moment. That's alright, Grover, you don't have to try to impress me. I know you're busy. Have a peanut? Or would that be considered a bribe? Extra! Extra! District attorney accepts peanut from city editor. That would be front page in that peanut paper of yours. That peanut paper elected you DA. - Sorry it did. - So I see. So sorry that you printed this nice, charming editorial about me. That? Oh, that. Why, that simply says you bought your election with your wife's money. That's a dirty lie and you know it. Now look, Holland, you can print anything you want about me... in that cheap scandal sheet of yours... But when you start dragging my family into it... That sounds like you might have a skeleton in the closet. If you have, I'll get a picture of it. I know what's eating you. Ever since you became city editor, you wanted me to run errands for you. You think I'm working for the Record, well I'm not. - Are you getting this? - I get it, I get it. As long as I'm holding this job, darn, I'm working for the state. And from now on, you keep those reporters of yours out of here... ...because you're not going to get any news from this office. Alright. Alright. If you don't let your foot slip, it's alright. - We've clipped bigger men than you are. - Are you threatening me? No, I never make threats. I'm just predicting. Say, listen, Grover, all kidding aside, what's happened to you? You never used to be like this. Who's been advising you lately? If you'd behave, you could be the next mayor. How do you know I want to be mayor? For two cents I'd resign as district attorney. You know, I don't like this job... ...and I don't like the people I have to do business with. That makes it unanimous. And from now on I'm going to make it my personal business... ...to keep you out of this office. And I'm going to make it my personal business... ...to keep you out of any office. Alright, print that! Good day, Mr. Holland. - In? - Yeah. Well, boss, it looks like I go to the head of the class. I finally dug up that spliff woman for you. Where? Here's her address, and she works down the Bronx. - Shall I bring her in? - No, never mind. I just wanted to know where she lived. - Forget about it. - All right. - Henry! - Er, Boss, er... - Help yourself. - Thanks. Henry, I'll be out for the rest of the afternoon. Yes. Oh, Marty... Never mind making a report out of this case. Okay, chief, no report. Henry, telephone my house and say I won't be there for dinner. - Going out? - That's right, thank you. Come on, honey. Come on, put your head back. Atta girl. A little more, honey. You have soap? You have soap and I have soap. Here we go. Come on. Up she goes. Isn't that good? Yes... Oh, no crying now. Oh, no, I can't have any crying. No, you're gonna be a good little girl. Come on. Come on, darling. There we go. Oh, no, we can't have any crying. All right, darling, if you're a good little girl, I'll sing you the moon song, all about the stars and the moon... Are you gonna be good? Lulu! Lulu, please. Oh, please, 66, open the door. I want to talk to you, dear. Please, can't you hear me? Lulu, open the door, please. Please, 66, let me come in. Please, I want to talk to you. I only want to talk to you. Please. Lulu! Lulu, listen. Lulu! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob. Sweetheart. Don't cry, dear. Please don't cry. We're together again, sweetie, please. Oh, look. It's the wrong button. It's wrong everything with me. That's why I've been trying to find you. That's why I've been looking everywhere for you, dear. Everywhere. If you only... If you only knew how I've serached for you. One day I followed a woman up the street for five blocks. - When I caught up with her, why... - What happened? Oh, dear, I can hear that slap. I haven't been a bit of good without you, dear. Mama! Come, Mama. Oh... Oh, I forgot. Your daughter's name was Roberta. - Hello, Mama. - Hello! Up she goes. Careful, honey. Wait here for me. No, I says, No, there can't be two women in the world like that. It's Lulu Smith, I says. Well, is it or isn't it? Hello, Al. Sit right down, Mr. Holland, I can't tell you how glad I am to see you. Where have you been all this time? Oh, here and there. Mostly there. I looked for you in every jail in the state. Oh, I got time off for good behavior. Say, listen, baby, would it shock you to know that my heart's been broken? It's been going potato, potato, potato for the last couple of years. Who's your lady friend? Yes, honey. Go on, my head's bloody, but I'm bowed. - You're married. - No. Niece? No. You're a governess. Yes... and I think I'd better be getting her home. Hold everything! Hardened swain takes a new lease on life. Wait a minute? Who do you work for, what's your phone number? Daddy! Daddy! Hello, Grover. This is the gentleman I'm working for. Mr. Grover, meet Mr. Holland, of the Record. Oh, I know Mr. Grover. Used to know him pretty well. Didn't know he had a baby, though. Well, there might be lots of things that you don't know. Always willing to learn. So you've been holding out on us, huh? Hello, baby. Adopted, or...? She does look like it at that. Yes, she's adopted. Well, that's fine. It'll make a nice little story. I was under the impression that your paper didn't care to give me any publicity. Oh, this is different. Human interest. Make a nice little yarn. Say, I'd like to send up a photographer to get a picture, you the baby and Mrs. Grover. We can't use Mrs. Grover, can we? She's in Europe. Well, uh... don't forget to give me a buzz, Lulu. When does Mrs. Grover get back from Vienna? - Goodbye, Holland. - Treatments do any good? I know Holland. He'll print the story, alright. And her boat gets in tomorrow. I hate to think what this will do to Helen. What did you tell him, that I adopted the baby? Yes, I told him I was working for you as Bobbie's governess. Bad Mama. - Where is she? - Wait a minute, wait a minute! Please, one at a time. What ever made you think of doing such a thing, Bob? Now, dear, there are two things that you've always wanted. A home and a baby. You have this beautiful home... - Wait until you see this baby. - Where is she? I told you, she's downtown getting some clothes with the governess. Governess? - Hm-hmm. What do you know about engaging a governess? I'll discharge her at once. Remember now, don't call me Mama. Say Lulu. Lulu. - Are you the governess? - Yes. Will you wait here, please? Oh, here she is. The governess is here, madam. Oh, the baby's here. Oh, it is real, isn't it? Oh, dear! Isn't she charming? Oh, my, but she's beautiful! - Well, shall we send her back? - Over my dead body. Isn't she adorable? What's the matter, do you want to get down? Do you want to get down? Oh, Bobbie, Bobbie, Bobbie, Bobbie, bye-bye. In your mammy's arms, be creepin'... ...and soon you'll be asleepin'. Sleepin. Bobbie, Bobbie, Bobbie, bye-bye. Doctor, she's just too adorable. And so healthy... yes. No, no, we don't know her parents. Listen, if you're any friend of mine, you come over this minute and tell me exactly what I should do for her. All right, thank you. Goodbye. - Bob! Bob! - Hello, dear. What's this for? You can make a person happier than anybody else in the world. My baby has done me more good than all the doctors in Vienna. - I'm glad, dear. - I'm going to pretend it's our very own. The one we always wanted. The nurse is just putting her to sleep. She's simply adorable. - Come on up and look at her. - Not just now, dear. I sneaked out of a lot of work at the office this morning... ...and I have to run down tonight for a few hours. - Tonight? - I'm sorry, dear, but... Well, I suppose I ought to complain. But I'm too happy. You couldn't have said welcome home more beautifully. It is home now, isn't it? Yes, dear. It will make a difference, won't it? Sure it will, dear. Now will you excuse me, because I have to run along. Oh, hello. Is the baby asleep? Yes. I think it's time we got better acquainted. Mr. Grover spoke to me about you this afternoon. He said he hadn't made any permanent arrangement. No. I'm sure there won't be any trouble about that, Miss, er... - Smith. - Now, about references, Miss Smith. I haven't any references. - No references? - I've never been a nurse maid before. Well, er... of course you've had some experience with children. A teacher perhaps. Or maybe you've had children of your own. Why, Bob! Where on earth did you get that woman? Well, dear, I don't know, er... A friend of mine, somebody in the office told me about her. I wouldn't trust her with the baby for one moment. That woman's crazy... or drugged. I'll have to get someone else at once. Alright, dear, now you take care of it your own way. Do whatever you like, dear. I have to go, I'm late now. Lulu, what happened? Why did you leave my house? That's why, because it is your house. You didn't expect me to stay there, did you? But dear, it was your idea. You suggested it. - Sure I did. I was a fool, I was crazy. - But you've got to come back. What for, to see you make love to your wife? But it will work out, honest it will. You can't leave me now, I need you. Haven't you got enough? What more do you want? - Holland can't hurt you now. - I don't care about Holland. Now listen... Oh, let me go! If you hadn't found me before, I'd be alright now. - I'd have my baby! Let me go! - Come on, let's get in this cab. - Where to? - Just drive around. Now look here, I want you to come to your senses. I have! That's why I'm quitting. I'm through with you. Now stop being hysterical. Wasn't it your idea? Wasn't I trying to do the right thing? You got me into this and now you're quitting. What for? What did I do? You left me, didn't you? That's enough! Now stop talking nonsense. What do you want me to do? Just let me alone, that's all. Driver, let me out! - Now, you sit down, wait a minute. - Leave me alone! Driver! - Now wait a minute. You wait right here! - Let me go! Wait till I pay this cab now, wait. Wait a minute... come here! Are you going to make me yell for a policeman? I'm going to make you talk sense. Now sit down. Now let's get this straightened out. What's eating you? - Let's get down to facts. - Alright, here's one fact. I've had nothing but trouble ever since I met you. Well, it hasn't been any bed of roses for me either. What do you want me to do? I've told you time and again you can have anything I've got. What have you got? You're all tied up, you belong to your job, and if you quit that, I'd be to blame. You belong to your wife. If you quit her, I'd be to blame. No matter what happens, I'd be to blame. I've done the best that I could. If I give her up, I'm a swine. And if I give you up... But I'm not going to give you up. What do you want me to be? What can I look forward to? This? Sneaking around, hiding like an alley cat for the rest of my life? No, not me. Read your speeches to your wife. Stop yelling! I know what I'm saying! You're poison to me! Poison! I'm sorry I ever met you. But I'm not old. You're not the only man in the world. I don't have to stop living! Not for you, not for anybody! Aren't you afraid you'll catch cold? Don't you think you'd better go home? Go home to bed. Don't leave me, Lulu, please. Alright. Better help me find me a place to live. Yeah? Yeah. The dirty gargoyle always knew he'd die before the afternoon papers. Well get the lead out of your pants and go down and get me a diagram of the apartment. Work in a love nest angle. Fill it full of dotted lines. With a great big cross to mark the spot. A double cross. The guy never advertised. Is there a diary? That's alright, we'll write one here. Yeah. Yeah? What? Did you tell him you're from the Record? They wouldn't let you in anyway, huh? That's alright, I'll fix him. Listen, Red. That goose-neck park commissioner is going moniker on us. I want you to write a squib about him every day... ...and mispell his name everytime you use it. Yeah. - What do you want, boy? - She said it was personal. - Why didn't you tell me? - Well, I tried to... - Say, Mr. Holland, how about that... - No! Well, that's settled. Hey, who left this light on? Turn it out, somebody! Well, Lulu Smith. How is the governess racket? - Ex-governess. - Hey, hey! - Situation: wanted female. - Oh-oh! - Newspaper work preferred. - Ah-ha! "Prodigal daughter returns", semicolon... " Patient Poppa... pants... passionately." Period! So you want a job. Well, come on in. I'm glad to see you. Who's in charge of the reference room now? Hey, ain't anybody turned out that light yet? Can you write? - Well... - You're hired. I know just the job for you. Sit down there. One of our boys is quitting today. Coming, boss. Yes, Boss? Nick, this s Miss Lulu Smith. She's gonna take your place. - How do you do, Miss Smith. - Give her the lowdown. Thank you, Mr. Holland. It's alright, I'll collect my commission later. This way, miss. Okay, boss. Sit there, ma'am. Now, I'll be glad to tell you anything you want to know. Well, I'd like to know what job I'm taking. - You're taking over my column. - What column is it? Advice to the Lovelorn. Well, didn't the Lovelorn column used to be run by Mary Sunshine? That's me. Anybody that runs this column is Mary Sunshine. - You're gonna be Mary Sunshine now. - What do I have to do? Well... if you play solitaire, it'll help to pass the time away. You get stacks of letters every day. Hundreds of them. You take out six... ...for the column. And the rest... ...dump them under there. There. Don't you read them? No, they're all alike. Well, here they are. You can read them and weep. Everytime I look at them... ...it reminds me of my sweetie. I'm going out and giving her a ring. Excuse me. Well, I've come to collect my commission. In advance? I don't mind telling you I was sore when I found out you were working for Grover. But I'm glad now because it's liable to come in handy. - You're gonna help me. - Is that why you gave me this job? There aren't any strings attached to anything I do for you. I guess you know that. But the paper's out to get Grover, and you work for the paper. I got a hunch we can do it through this kid he adopted. What do you think? Some of these letters are comical. He never adopted that kid, did he? Men don't do things like that while their wives are in Europe. That's hunch number two. Dear Mary Sunshine, I'm in love with a young man 15 years my... And my third hunch is this. You've been working for Grover and you've had a chance to find out things. - What did you dig up? Come on. - Do I get a bonus? A bonus? You get a bonus, a raise and a kiss. Well, by peeking through the keyhole I found out that Mr. Grover takes his coffee black, listens in on Amos and Andy, and... he wears pink suspenders. Come on, get off the comic page. Where did he dig up that kid? Oh, he told me under a cabbage leaf. Ah... What a chance you passed up. You'll never make a newspaper woman. Am I fired? No. I still think you'll make a newspaperman. Go on, give advice. Couldn't stake a guy to a bromo-seltzer, could you? No, but I could stake you to some good advice. Al, why don't you... I know, I know, booze and broads and barber shop cords. Who was them ladies I seen you with last night? Them was no ladies. Them was... ...no ladies. When you can't have one, you go for all of them. It don't mean anything. You're different. I'd do anything in the world for you. Well, can I have a couple of days off? No! What for? Oh, I'd like to go to the convention. Still interested in your old boss, huh? - Even though he's mud to me. - No, it's not that, Al, but... I've never been to a convention and I'd like to see what they're like. And then I thought you might like to have a few paragraphs on the woman's angle. Well, here's a paragraph on the man's angle. How about giving in? Proposition or proposal? With this ring I do thee wed. I'm not the marrying sort. And I'm not the quitting sort. Irresistable force, that's me. Immovable body, that's me. - What happens when they meet? - They start a restaurant. What sort of a woman are you anyway? What are you saving yourself for? I'm just a newspaper punk... ...but I could be somebody with a woman like you to look up to, to brag to. What do you say, Lovelorn? Don't be silly, Al, you're married already. - Me? - Sure, to your newspaper. That's your sweetheart, that comes first. - Always has and always will. - Nah... It's you. - Holland! - Yeah? It's Dargan, there's a couple of mobs shooting it out over on the South side. Tell him to hold the wire. Hello, Ike. Yeah... yeah... Great! Sure, grab a cab. Hey, Pat, get a couple of photographers down there right away. Brown, Lee, Carson! Get Carson, somebody, he's in the washroom. Oh, Daddy, I did know you were going to win. Could you hold that pose, please? The nomination's in the bag, Grover. I made a special request to be seated behind you. I wanted to see how a four-flusher behaves when he has a full house. - We're about to start, Grover. - I'm ready. Ladies and gentlemen. You have been introduced... ...and listened to many capable men here today. But the next speaker, a candidate for the nomination... ...for governor of this state is a man who needs no introduction. He has served the people faithfully... ...for twenty years in various capacities. But his success as a human being, as a husband, as a father, and as a citizen has been even greater. Take a bow, Grover. He means you. I need not speak his name... but I take great pleasure in presenting the man... who before this convention is over, will carry the standard of the Party... ...to victory at the polls. The man who will soon bear the title, his honor, the governor. His honor, the governor. Whose public life has only been exceeded by the integrity of his private life. Oh, Bob, you were grand today. His honor, the governor. His honor, the hypocrite. Bob, what's the matter? Don't be like this tonight. Put your arms around me. This is the grandest moment of my life. It might have meant something if you had been with me. - But I was. - Yes, up in the gallery. Bob... His honor, the governor. Why, I used three taxis to sneak down here tonight. Afraid somebody would follow me, afraid somebody would find out. I'm through, I tell you. I'm going to do something I should have done years ago. Now, please, darling, don't. Why, I've take your life almost as though I were a murderer. Oh, I've been happy, honest I have. Watching you go ahead, feeling as though I had something to do with it. Something to do with it? Why, you've had everything to do with it... ...and gotten nothing out of it. To see you go ahead? Is that nothing? Why, I've watched you step by step go up. Your honors have been my honors. Your success has been my success. That's my pay, my reward. I'm not going to let you take it away from me. You'll get to the top, Bob. Nothing can stop you. Nothing but a sense of decency and a Mr. Al Holland. Oh, Holland can't hurt you. I won't give him a chance. I'll beat him to it. He sat up there on the platform this afternoon with all those people and... He sat up there... riding me. My worst enemy, but he told the truth. - He dared me to do the right thing. - But Bob, you are doing the right thing. I'm coming out in the open, Lulu. When I sat on that platform today with those people cheering me I... I felt just as low as a snake. I wanted to get up and tell the truth but... I'm too much of a coward, I've always been too much of a coward. Oh, no, Bob, you... And you've been changing from place to place like a camp follower... ...so nobody would know. We've lived like a couple of thieves, and what crime have we committed? - I can't do it anymore. - Shh, Bobby, quiet! I don't mind it anymore. I'm used to it. Besides, I won't let you tear down a career. Career, I don't want a career. All I want is you and the rest can go to... Oh, Bob, listen. Can't you see it's too late? We don't count anymore. How about your wife? She hasn't hurt anybody. You owe her something. Dear, I'm tired of hearing what I owe her. I've paid and I've paid plenty. - Look what I owe you. - But what about Roberta? She's engaged to be married. If it makes any difference to him, he's not worth marrying. Dear, I've got to do it. I don't sleep anymore and I'm... I'm sick inside. This is the one time when I've made up my own mind. And whether you like it or not, dear, I'm going through with it. Alright, Bob. What are we going to do? Why, dear, we'll... We'll run away, dear. We'll go back to Havana. We'll be 66 and 99 again. Whatever you say, dear. Sweetheart. Yeah? No, lay off mispelling his name. The guy apologized. Yeah. Now listen, you guys, we've uncovered some real dope... ...and I want you guys to get busy on it. It's the biggest thing that ever hit us. You know what I mean. We finally got the name of the hospital where the child was born... ...and the name of the mother, Jane Doe. Yeah? No, save that for the final edition. Yeah. So, between the three of you you ought to be able to find out who Jane Doe is. I know a haystack where we can find a swell needle. - I'm going in for crystal-gazing myself. - So it's too much for you. I'm running a school for journalism, am I? I gotta lead you guys around by the nose, do I, and show you? Now listen here, you fellows. Get this through your thick skulls. I want the name of the nurse who handled the case. I want to get her right here in this office. If she squawks, promise her anything. I want a photostatic copy of the birth certificate... ...and a hospital admission card. I want you to find out what became of Jane Doe after she left the hospital. Where she went, where she worked, what she did. I want Jane Doe right here in this office. And if you punks can't handle it, I'll find somebody who can. - Busy, Mr. Holland? - Oh, hello, Lovelorn. Stick around. Say, boss, what's it all about? Read the Record, son, and ask your questions on the outside. I wouldn't trust my own mother with this story. Pat'll give you the details. Alright, court's adjourned, court's adjourned. So? What are you doing tomorrow, Al? Running a newspaper. Could you... Could you stop long enough to marry me? Kidding? Not unless you were. Why all of a sudden? Oh, well, somebody's got to take me out of the gutter. Come here and give me a kiss. Mind if I print it? Oh, no, I'm doing it for the publicity. Hello, Pat? Got a little squib for you. Managing editor weds Lovelorn editor. Yeah, me. Yeah, her. Nix, nix. You can have her picture though. Yeah. Second page, valet. Well, it looks like Grover's our next governor. Complete returns from two thirds of the counties... ...gives him a plurality of 27.000 over Crandall. We'll give you more later. And now back to the main studio. Don't you like your stake? No, thanks, I'm not hungry. Why aren't you down at the office on election night? I'm working on a story. - Did you vote today? - Yes. For Grover? Yes. Well, I may let him be governor for a day at that. No, thanks. What do you mean? I mean the sappy people of this state may elect a double-dealing hypocrite... ...for the governor's chair but I'm going to knock him out of it. - Toast? - You seem to be awfully positive. Right! I've been working on a hunch, but now I've got the proof. Proof of what, Al? On the level, do you really love me? Well, I... I married you. Proof of what, Al? Proof of what? Proof that Grover's adopted daughter is his but not his wife's. Proof that he's been living with another woman all these years. I've got everything but a confession. And I'm working on that now. Twenty years ago, a woman named Jane Doe registered at a maternity hospital. There's a photograph of her admission card signed in her own handwriting. Exhibit B, the receipt for your last salary check... ...at the Record signed in your own handwriting. C, a photostatic copy of the birth certificate... ...of the child born to Jane Doe named Roberta. And this. A photograph which I found in your trunk. Of you and your boyfriend making whoopie in Havana. Nice story. Nice story about me, but what's it got to do with Grover? You've learned something working for the Record, haven't you? Well let me read you a letter which was addressed to you... ...but which you never received. Dear Lulu. You, who kept faith with me for twenty years, ...walked out on me when I needed you most. Perhaps you were right. Perhaps we're too old now. Or have we combed enough wreckage out of our lives? Your marriage to Holland, my worst enemy, saves my wife her pride, and my daughter, your daughter, her good name. But it deprives me for the rest of my life... ...of the happiness which, like the hypocrite who I've learned to be, I now wish you. Bob. Give me that letter, it's mine. You stole it. Stole it? Of course I stole it. I'd commit murder for a story like that. Oh, Al, listen, please. You can do anything you want to with me, but don't print that story. It'll only hurt a lot of people and it won't help anybody. It'll help me to forget what a sucker I've been. You married me to keep Grover from spilling his guts. - No! - You'd have married anybody. Please, you've got to understand, Al. - Grover hasn't been well. - Main 2800. - He's a sick man. - Well, he'll have a relapse in the morning. - Oh, Al, please. - I always knew he had a skeleton in the closet. What a sucker. Al, you've got to listen to me. Now, please... My daughter deosn't know anything about this. - She's engaged to be married. - I know why you married me. Hello, give me the city desk. Grover told you to, didn't he? He knew I was getting the goods on him, thought he could keep my mouth shut this way, is that it? No, no, no, believe me, Al! I married you to keep him from resigning. Al, you've got to listen... Hello, Pat? This is Holland. Hold everything, I'm coming right over. I'll need the whole front page. - You can't do anything like that! - Never mind the election. Keep your shirt on, I'll tell you when I get there. Oh, Al, don't you understand? It'll only hurt you too. - I'm your wife. - What do you mean wife? Everytime you kissed me you thought of him, didn't you, didn't you? I'm not as good as he is, am I? No! No! Alright, when I'm through with him you can have what's left of him. - Kiss him all you want to. - You give me that letter! I won't let you do anything like that! - Give it to me! - Why, you... Wait a minute, Al. If you hold that pose, I'll send up a photographer. Al. Put that gun down, Lulu. Lulu, give me that gun. Give me that gun. Mr. Thompson! Mr. Thompson! Somebody's shooting. Yes, on my floor. Hold everything, folks. Crandall concedes victory. Grover elected governor by an overwhelming majority. The governor got out of a sick bed to say a few words to you. And here he is now. Governor Grover. I'm too excited to say very much, but a want to thank all the good people who made my election possible. Open the door! What's the matter? Open the door! Yeah, this is Wilkins calling from the Capital. Yeah... No, there's nothing new. The governor's condition is still the same. Yeah, alright. It's eight to five he kicks off before the afternoon papers. - He always did hate the Record. - I'll take that bet. Yeah, well you won't catch me laying any odds. He's the kind that's liable to hang on for another year. Say, you newspaper guys are like a lot of vultures. Always hanging around waiting for someone to die. Hey, Pop, how long have you been dead? - Don't go in, Martin, don't go in. - But he sent for me, Doctor. Alright, alright, but just a moment at the most. The man doesn't know how sick he is. I won't be long. How are you feeling, sir? What kept you? Working with that fool doctor again, eh? - He didn't want me to stay too long. - Is she on her way? - She's down in my car now, sir. - Why didn't you bring her up with you? Well... the reporters... There's been so much talk... ...about you pardoning her in less than a year. After all, she... she is a murderess. Let them talk. I'm still the governor. I should have pardoned her the first week. - Bring her right in here. - Yes, sir. - Oh, Martin. - Yes, sir? - Have you a pen and paper? - Yes, sir. - Can I help you, sir? - No, let me alone. I... I had a cable from Europe. Your wife and daughter are sailing at once. Yes, yes, bring Mrs. Holland right up here. Yes, sir. Sixty-six. Ninety-nine. Funny, I was on my back the first time we met, wasn't I? Let me look at you, look here. You know, you haven't changed. You still look beautiful. You look fine yourself, Bob. I should have gone to prison instead of you, but... ...you never would let me do anything for you, would you? You mustn't talk, dear. Read this, dear. You'll never leave me anymore, will you, Lulu? Never. You were right, Bob. We should have gone away together. I thought about it a lot in prison. All the fun we missed because I was stubborn and obstinate. But it isn't too late, dear. Let's make a deal. You get well, and I'll run away with you. We'll go back to Havana on our honeymoon. Wasn't it a grand holiday, the last time? The first time? Remember the time we played roulette... and then the next day I lost all our winnings on a horse, and then we had champagne? Remember the toast you drank to me? To the world's best loser. Remember, 99? Bob. Bob! Oh, Bob. The governor passed on at 2:25 p.m. - Joe, the governor passed away at 2:25 p.m. - Don't forget that 8 bucks you owe me, Romer. City desk, the governor died at 2:25 p.m. Grover died at 2:25 p.m. He passed on at 2:25 The governor passed away at 2:25 this afternoon. Governor Grover dies! Read all about it! Extra! Extra!
