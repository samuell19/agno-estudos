Thank you, Judith. Sit up. Straight. Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi custodiat animam tuam in vitam aeternam. Amen. Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi custodiat animam tuam in vitam aeternam. Amen. Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi custodiat animam tuam in vitam aeternam. Amen. - Stop that. - Yes, Aunt D'Arcy. Stop that at once, Judith. Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus, Pater, et Filius, et Spiritus Sanctus. - Amen. - Amen. Oh, be careful, please. There's precious things in there. Thank you. You're welcome, I'm sure. There. Aunt, dear. The cosiest place for you. Oh, things are going to be better here than the other places. I feel it. A new start. I promise. I'm telling you, Mama, my eye is burning up. Give me a towel. - Keep them tight shut, now, darling. - Oh, Mama, not yet! Oh, shite! One of these days, you're going to be struck down for that tongue. Oh, give me a towel, damn it! "And just as teatime struck, "his eyes his Mama did pluck." - Yes, Miss Hearne? - I wonder... would you ever have a hammer you could lend me? - Oh... - To hang a picture. - I'm terribly sorry for troubling you. - Oh, no, not at all. I did manage to bring the hook. Now, where did I...? Look, why don't you come in and have some tea? It's brewing this very minute. Why, I hate to put you out, really. - Mary? Mary! - Yes? Look at the dresser in the attic, and bring me the hammer. - Mary! - Yes, ma'am. Oh, these convent girls! Do they ever listen to the nuns? Bernie, this is Miss Hearne. Remember I told you? Our new guest. This is Bernard. My only boy. Pleasure, I'm sure. Sit by the fire, Miss Hearne. Take that chair. Mama won't mind. Put on your dressing gown. It's perishing cold out. He's a little delicate, Miss Hearne. Been under the weather lately. This... is this book interesting, Mr Rice? Fascinating. I find bits of meself on every page. Seventeenth-century verse. Bernie's a poet. Always studying. He's at the university. I am not, Mama! I haven't been there for six years. He has the artistic temperament. - Milk and sugar, Miss Hearne? - Two lumps. Thank you. And just... just a soup√ßon of milk. Thank you. And, erm... have you lived long in Dublin, did you say? Since I was a child. My parents died when I was very young, and my dear aunt, God rest her soul, took me to live with her here in Dublin. In Ballsbridge. - Have a biccie, Bernie. - Is your poor aunt dead long, Miss Hearne? Three years. - Oh, Mary. - The hammer, ma'am. Oh, Mary, put it there. And Mary, wait till I say "come in", before you actually come in. This is Miss Hearne. First floor front. - Ma'am. - How do you do, Mary? I got her from the nuns at the convent. Oh, these country girls! They need a lot of breaking in. My aunt used to have a lot of trouble with convent-trained girls. Always taking up with soldiers, and other riff-raff. Oh, Mama would never put up with that. Would you, Mama? They'd see the other side of the door right quick. Our house is devout. - Another biccie, Bernie? - No, thanks. - Ah, just one. - No, Mama! Miss Hearne? No. I... I really should be getting back. My picture, you know. - It's the Sacred Heart. - Aah. I always hang it over my bed whenever I get into a new place. Like having a real friend with you. Just so. Well, thank you for the hammer, Mrs Rice. I'll return it just as soon as I've finished with it. No rush, dear. Oh, and remember. Breakfast at seven-thirty sharp. Nothing for me from America? No, Jim. Want to come in? Yeah. Ah, this is Miss Hearne, our new boarder. Miss Friel, Miss Hearne. How do you do? And this is my brother James. Mr Madden, Miss Hearne. Glad to know you, Miss Hearne. - Pleased, I'm sure. - Sit down, Miss Hearne. Mr Lenehan had to go to work. You're late this morning, Miss Hearne. - Sugar and milk? - Please. Mary! Miss Hearne's toast! I see a family resemblance. You and your brother. I do. Some see the likeness between us. It escapes me! Always the way. Brothers and sisters can't see it. Oh, it's there. Mary! Oh. Thank you. - And where did you live in America, Mr...? - New York City. - New York City! - Yeah. Lived there for thirty years. Came back here two months ago. Oh. To stay? Did you bring Mr Bernard up his tray, Mary? About to, ma'am. Oh, you must speed things up in the morning. He gets hungry. You must find Dublin dull, after New York. My goodness, after all that excitement. You can say that again. Greatest city in the world! Miss Friel's a schoolteacher. Very conscientious. Miss Hearne, Mary will have to be tidying up in here soon, so... don't be too long, hmm? Breakfast tomorrow, seven-thirty, dear. What part of Ireland you from? Oh... I've spent most of my time here in Dublin. Is that so? - Do you mind if I smoke? - Oh no, no. I don't smoke myself, but smoking never bothers me. I hope you'll tell me more about America, Mr Madden. I'd love to go there. Yeah. I could talk all day and never finish. My business, you see a lot of things. What... what business is that? The hotel. I was in the hotel business right on Times Square. - You heard of Times Square? - Oh, of course. I've seen it in the newsreels. Such an exciting place. Mmm. Watch the world go by. It's ten minutes past the hour, Miss Hearne. I was searching for these books in the library, Mrs Mullen. The time just... just flew. Never mind. I'll stay extra time. I usually do. Alice isn't feeling well. She won't be taking her piano lesson. I rang your number this morning, but you aren't there anymore. Er... no, I moved. - Do you think I should come back tomorrow? - No. She's really not well. Then I'll... I'll see Alice at her regular time next week. When I rang to tell you Alice was sick, the woman... the landlady, I think she said, told me things... that happened. Lies. Landladies, you know, Mrs Mullen. They gossip. They love to make things up. I don't want you teaching Alice the piano any more. Why? It's cold. Good day to you, Miss Hearne. No, Mrs Mullen... Please. Last month, two pupils moved away. Alice is doing so well. I was thinking of starting her on Chopin. You know, the piece I play for her. She loves it. You play too much in the lesson, and not all that well, Miss Hearne. I used to play in musicales. Well, don't faint, Aunt, dear. He noticed me today. - No, I can't. - Just one more time. - No, no, no, no, no! - Ssh! You'll wake Mama! What's going on here? Want something? What the hell do you think this is? A whorehouse? Get back to your room. It's none of your business. None of my business? Then whose business is it, huh? What would your mother say, huh? You, you little whore! What would your father say, huh? You little whore. You're just like her, you're just like my little daughter. My, my Sheila. She... - I'll teach you, you little whore. - Don't, mister! Please, don't! - You whore! You whore! - Leave her alone! Garbage! Whore! - Leave her alone! - Get out of here! Get out of here! Get... get out of here! I should tell your Ma on you. She'd have a priest after you. You were the one who went crazy in there. - You'd have raped her if... - I'd have what? Ssh, ssh, ssh, for Christ's sake, keep your voice down. You're the one who screwed her, not me. You wanted to. I could make it sound bad against you, Uncle James. And Mary would back me up. Two against one. Forget it. You just keep your pecker out of sight of that little whore, you hear? You too! What the hell do you take me for? Mary! Toast for Mr Madden. - Good morning. - Morning. Oh, Mr Madden, I was in the library yesterday, and I just happened to come across this picture book about New York. It reminded me of our conversation. Very nice. When do you think we'll be getting some good coffee, May? When I'm dead and under? Maybe not even then. Mr Rice, my late husband, despised the taste of the stuff. In America, everyone must drink coffee, for sure. The best drink in the world. There... there was this picture, in this book, of all the bridges in New York. It was just so wonderful. Such a wonderful city. It's quite a town, huh? D'you see the Brooklyn Bridge? Oh yes, and the Manhattan. The George Washington? Now that's a bridge. - Oh, yes. - The Williamsburg? The Triborough? - Oh, my goodness! - There's one... there's one more. Um... And all those buildings. The Empire State. The Bronx, Whitestone, that's it. Oh, my goodness! - You know them all. - I've seen them all. Ah, Bernie, come and sit down. Morning, everybody. I rang my bell twice, and not a peep out of that girl. I suppose she was out all night with some soldier or other. I'm starving lying up there, waiting for her. Maybe some bacon and egg? The doctor says he has to eat, to keep his strength up. Mary, two eggs, and four rashers of bacon for Mr Bernard. Well, now... what were we talking about when I interrupted? About America. - About how wonderful it must be. - And what is wrong with Ireland? It's backward as hell. Shit, the States is a hundred years ahead of Europe and Ireland. The atom bomb, Mr Lenehan. That's the American contribution to Western civilisation. And they didn't even discover that. 'Twas the Europeans figured that out. Just let the Yanks build it. Yeah? We Yanks didn't ask to get in Europe's wars, did we? We didn't ask to come over here and win 'em for you. I'm trying to mark these papers! And if it was all so blooming terrific in America, why did you ever come home? You're just a bunch of hicks. Not you, Miss Hearne. Goddamn hicks! On this little island, which you... you could could drop inside Texas and never see. Who cares? The rest of the world never heard of it. My uncle, sometimes, is a wee bit soft... where it counts. Maybe he misses his family. Is... is there anyone of his back in America? His daughter. She's grown up. - Anyone else? - His wife died. Good day to you all. Oh... Mr Madden, I just wanted to say... I agree with you about how far ahead things must be in the United States. You're an educated woman, Miss Hearne. Oh, erm, Mr Madden... you know, I... I usually go to the eleven o'clock Mass on Sunday. Do you have a usual time? Well, the time doesn't matter. You've just gotta get through it. Yes, well, you... you see more people at the eleven o'clock. Well, maybe I can walk along with you, if that's okay, huh? I'd be glad of your company. Well, I'll see you. They're real. What a pity she looks like that! In church, with a man kneeling beside me. All Americans must dress that way, like a comedian in a music hall. Oh, I should have left her alone the other night. What a build! Christ, I mean... Blessed Jesus, forgive me. Devout... and respectable. That limp... you'd hardly notice it. Plenty of money. Plenty of time. But the people of this parish don't have it for their church. Oh, they've time for sin. Time for naked dancing girls in the cinema, gallivanting in glorious Technicolor. Time to drink the pubs dry. To dance the tango, and the foxtrot, and the... the jitterbugging! Time for any blessed thing you could care to mention, except one. They don't have time for God. And if you don't have time for God, God will have no time for you. Father Quigley's such an honest speaker. Mmm. - Great presence, hasn't he? - Mmm. He looks sick to me. I mean... I knew a priest in New York like that. He had TB. I guess you've got a lot of things to do. Going back to the house? Oh, I visit my friends, the O'Neills, every Sunday. - Oh. - He's a professor at the University. Is that right? His wife and I were at school together. She's married now, with a family of her own. I'm very close to all of them. Almost like an aunt. - I got a date up town myself. It's a... - Oh, I don't have to be there, though... A business deal I'm... considering. See ya. - Thanks for your company. - Any time. Miss Hearne... There's not much to do in this town, and that's a fact. Not like New York. Do you like the movies? You mean the pictures? Yes. You doing anything tomorrow afternoon? No. I don't believe I am. Okay, we'll... we'll take in a show, then, shall we? And maybe a bite to eat after? - Lovely. - Well, okay. I'll see you. Bye. Bye. It's only me! - It's only me! - Will you stop that! I'm afraid I've got to finish some examination papers. Tell Judith I'll, er... I'll see her at teatime. I'll come with you, Daddy. You stay here, young man, and help your mother. Now, no nonsense, please. My paper on Bernard Shaw's due Tuesday. I want you to spend a little time with poor Judith Hearne. - Last Sunday... - But Ma, I've got to read three plays. It's only me! Judith, dear, and how are you? Oh, just... just so happy to be here, Moira, my dear. - Come and sit yourself down. - Oh, what a day! Una, Shaun! They've been laughing themselves sick all day. The young at heart. Another couple over here, John! Damn cost of living! Wouldn't a fellow be better off to find himself some island to retire to? Like the West Indies. Cheap, sunshine, and damn good rum. No. It's on me, Major. You might be right. A guy could go out there and set up a little business... something the natives don't have. Maybe a little curio shop. You know, for the tourists. Like, if I could get a concession, maybe... I remember in Haiti, some of the white men lived like kings. Great whacking big houses, dozen servants. Imagine a nubile native girl dropping her sarong, and leading you to the sheets... Oh, don't, Jesus! I haven't had a piece since... I bet you did your share when you were out there, huh? By God, I did. We Irish conquered by peaceful penetration. - Care for another, James? - Mmm! John, m'boy, another round. Oh, Major, you paint a pretty picture. Well, James, the way I see it, we've got it all wrong, you know, thinkin' the women don't like it. The way I see it, they want it more than we do. - Ah, no. - It's a fact, I tell you. What about a fine woman? A lady of leisure, with ruby rings on her fingers, huh? Even the Queen of England. - Such a wonderful movie. - Wonderful. - You were crying buckets in there. - I always do at the pictures. I heard Victor Mature lived in a tent when he was trying to break into movies. Really stuck to it, you know. Stick at it. It's the only way to get anywhere. I'm sure you have that quality. Well, I don't fold up, I can tell you that. That's why I'm bloody here. Believe it or not, she has the gall to say to me: "Why don't you go back to Ireland, Dad? "Get a piece of the old sod." And they open a door and kick your ass. Son of a bitch! - Who's that? - Do you know what he calls me? A dumb Irish Mick. Yeah. And he's the one that's layin' my Sheila before they was married. And she, too. Ashamed of me. Me. Brought her up. Good. Huh? The two of them. Holy Americans. - I'm sorry. - You don't have to be sorry. Wasn't you. I'm sorry someone made you feel so bad. I bought her any colour dress she wanted. Yeah. Do you plan on staying on here in Dublin a while? I got a couple of deals cookin', yeah. - In the hotel trade? - No. No, I'm thinkin' about something else right now. You know, my aunt used to know the manager of the Arcady Hotel. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Mister... oh! So your... your future prospects might keep you here? That's right. I'm interested in something right here. - Bunting. - Huh? - That was his name. - Oh. - Mr Bunting. - Yeah. His clothes always looked as if they were drowned in starch. Must've been mighty uncomfortable sittin' down! Must've been. He was always perspiring. All right, all right, I'll take you dancin'. Well, I had a lovely time. Ditto. Time goes fast when you're in good company. Yeah. Well, good night, now. Good night. Judith Hearne, you're silly. He's asked me to step out with him again. I know you're happy for me. Oh, Aunt D'Arcy! Get her head back. That's it. That's it That's all right. - Oh, that bell! - I don't know how you manage it. You must be a saint, Judy. - Have a nip yourself. - Oh, ssh! It's only your auntie's old tonic wine, so where's the harm? You won't even have to mention it in confession. I will so. Ssh. Don't tell me Father O'Malley's above having a wee sup of the holy stuff himself now and again. You're a wicked woman, so you are, Edie Marinan. All right. All right, all right, all right. Yes, all right. - We got the dulcet message. - If you got the message, lunch would be here on time, for a change! And where's the sweet, eh? The cake. Where is it? You're trying to starve me, Judith Hearne. I know it. Dr Bowe wanted us lightening up on the sweets. Dr Bowe, the quack. And you, the country clod. Both after something I'm not prepared to provide. Eat your lunch, Aunt. My money's mine, and I don't intend to starve, thanks be to God. The chop's burned. - It's how you like it. - No, it's burned! Eat the beans, Aunt D'Arcy. You're trying to poison me. Making me eat a chop that's burned, and I won't! I won't! I won't! If you're so worried about being poisoned, you needn't bother to eat at all. Nobody cares. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I... I want the beans. Bring them back! Judith! Please. Please, Judith. Please. Plea... please. No, I don't want the chop! I want the cake! Bring me the cake! I want the cake. I want the cake. The cake. Bring me the cake. I want the cake. The cake, the cake, the cake, the cake, the cake, the cake... My aunt and I used to come here for dinner, after a concert. It must be, oh... ten years since I've been here. Tell me it wasn't the food that kept you away! No, my aunt was bedridden those years. I nursed her. I think she's asleep, butjust in case... She won't be able to hear us in here, Doctor. All right. Now you'll have to sign the papers first, Miss Hearne. Dr Bowe, look. I know... I know... I know I... I agreed, when you advised me... I called in Dr Walsh. I called in Dr Ryan. We all concurred. A private asylum, a private home. That's where your aunt should be. Yes, but... but we have managed here, Dr Bowe. Not... not always singing the most cheerful songs, I know, but... we... we have managed, since the stroke. She'll need more care. Special care, as time goes on. And... if your aunt's funds are diminishing, as I understand... well, there's always Grangegorman Asylum. It's too much for you to look after her alone. It's for the best. Let... let me go up and see her alone first. God Almighty, Aunt, what are you doing? You've hidden them, hmm? Where are my slippers? - Come on. You'll catch your death. - I'm not daft. Even though you're trying to have me sh... shut up. And you've hidden my slippers, and I've got to get away. - Oh, come on, get back into bed. - How I hate a liar! Dr Bowe bringing all those doctors to see me. I know what you're planning. - You're telling them that I'm mad. - Oh, no, no, no, no, I haven't been. And I sheltered you. An orphan who nobody wanted, for, God forgive me, I wouldn't put you in an institution. And now you... you... of all people... you'd lock me in a madhouse. Like a criminal in a cell. Yes, and I took you in. I remember... the day of your mother's funeral. You picked up the earth, but you... but you wouldn't throw it on the grave. No, nobody could make you. You just held it clutched tight in your little pink hand, and... and you brought that earth into my house... with the two combs from your mother's... your mother's hair. My poor sister. You're not going anywhere, Aunt. I'm sorry. I won't let them take you. I won't. Promise me. I promise. Honestly I do. I promise. Well, tonight, I feel, is a very special occasion, you know? Oh, thank you. Would you have a cocktail before dinner? No, thank you. Our future. You know, talking about our future. a man's got to have something to work for, Judy. You see, when I came home... well, I'll tell you. My kid's got no time for me anymore. That's rotten. But what counts, though, is to keep busy, to get something going, you know? That's why this occasion is so special. Listen, Judy... Did you ever eat a hamburger here? Hmm? Or a hot dog? Oh, sure you did. What they call a hamburger here. Not a real hamburger, with mustard and relish. And real franks, you don't see those either, do you? In New York, you can get a hamburger on every corner. Yeah. A real American quick lunch. You ever tried to get a quick lunch in this town? You can't do it, can you? But... the people here don't eat hamburgers. Right, Judy. Absolutely right. But who does? Americans? Give the girl a cigar. Yeah. See, that's my idea. That's my moneymaker. What Dublin needs is a good American eating place, right in the centre of town. Hmm? Well, that makes sense. All I need is a partner. Suppose, just suppose, that you were a businessman, and I came to you with such a proposition. - What would you say? - I'd probably say yes. But you're not convinced. Okay. Okay, say I told you that I would match all the capital that you put in. - What would you say then? - Ah, well, then. That would be convincing. Any businessman would know you were sincere. Yeah, but would you say yes? I... I think it's a very good idea. Great! We understand each other, Judy. I like you. You got a good head on you. Oh, God, I forgot. Oh, if they're crushed... They're still fresh. And beautiful. Thank you. Well, um... I'll look into it, Judy, and check the costs, and I'll give you a full report, hmm? Oh, could I have another whisky, please? Thank you. Er... Judy? Er, no. No, thank you. - Oh, she couldn't... - Oh, no? She couldn't possibly make you count every single piece of toast you eat. And then she squawks "You slammed the door comin' in last night. - "Nearly knocked it off its hinges, is it?" - Ssssh! Well, hello. Ah, May! I was being quiet, just for you. Quite an improvement. Come on inside, now. Bernie and I are just finishing up our cribbage. I'm going to make tea. Um, another time, thanks. It's getting a bit late, and... Ah, Jim, will you have a nice visit for a change? I'm sure Miss Hearne wouldn't mind, would you, dear? Well... it does sound very tempting. Come on in now, and sit down. So, Mama, you owe me two shillings if we're stopping now. We're stopping. Well, I hope that you two enjoyed the evening. Oh, yes, thank you. Well, now, Uncle James. Mama thought you'd like a cup of tea after being out there in the cold, but I said you'd rather have some coffee. No thanks, Bernie boy. We had coffee with the dinner. - At the Shelbourne. - Oh, nice! And those are quite nice blooms you're wearing, Miss Hearne. - Gardenias. - Gardenias. I know they're gardenias. What do you take me for? - A dimwit? - Hey, listen, May, I'm sorry if... Well, now, let me just get tidying up this mess. God bless us! The kettle! Miss Hearne, would you mind wetting the tea, dear, while I tidy up? The tea's in the canister. In there. Thank you, dear. If I wanna take somebody out, May, it's no skin off your teeth. When I think of all the dinners you've eaten here, and never so much as asked me if I had a mouth on me. And you living here for months, rent free. - I'm your own brother. - Sssh! Now, Uncle James, I want you to know this is nowt to do with me. Now, Mama... She's set her cap for you, that's all. That boarder wants to marry you. May, you're crazy. Miss Hearne's a real lady. She's got class. Playing the grand lady's more like it, with all that la-di-da carry-on. Christ, lay off, will ya? Where do you think she got all them rings from? - She's got dough. - Oh, is that so? Well, I'm telling you, she never eats a decent meal. - From the look of her room... - Will you cut it out? Now. Let's face it. You'd be no temptation to a woman nowadays. That one is only running after you to spend what little money you might have. You're full of it. That one is a smart businesswoman. The kind of woman that, if she likes you, there's nothing she wouldn't do for you. There's nothing she could do for you! I'm sick of you. And your little Baby Jesus. Except make you forget your nearest and dearest. Ah, shut up! It's only me. Tea's ready.. Lovely, dear. Thank you. - Where's Mr Madden? - Jim? Oh, he really didn't want any tea. He was tired. - He left without... - Why don't you take your coat off, Miss Hearne? Come and sit down. - I'm a little cold. - Bernie, dear, poke up the fire. Warm things up. You like the pictures as much as Uncle James, Miss Hearne? I enjoy them. I think that Betty Grable's his favourite actress. Come and sit down, Miss Hearne. The thing that annoys me most about Jim is the way he wastes his time. So much of it. I understood Mr Madden is considering going into a particular business over here. Business? Well, he'd be far better off putting his money into a guest house, for instance. I've told him I might run it for him. Ah, but poor Jim. Never had a head for business. Mr Madden impresses me as having a very good financial sense. Opening the doors of taxis is more in his line. - What do you mean? - Mama, Mama... surely Miss Hearne is not interested in hearing family troubles? Oh, no, indeed I am. - What... what... what did you mean? - Well, I meant that... Mama, Mama, me Uncle James wasn't always a doorman. Had to get out and hustle. Remember? He'd lots of jobs. Oh, yes. Janitor, subway cleaner... Lucky for him that bus running over his leg finally, and him getting the insurance money. What little it might have been. And all that time, Miss Hearne, my uncle had his own car. A green Studebaker. Never as much as offered me one day's rent, all the time he's been here. Oh no, Jim doesn't spread himself on his family. Only on money-grabbing outsiders. - Are you referring to me? - Of course not! Oh yes, you are. Did you ask me in here to insult me, I'd like to know? Ah, no, no, don't get all excited. Outsiders. No, I mean those fellers he wastes his time with, buying them drinks. Good-for-nothings. Of course, you would know a good-for-nothing. - Now, if you'll excuse me, Mrs Rice... - Ah, now, no, no, no... Won't you have a cup of tea, dear? Oh, I'd be mortified if you took offence, when none was intended. We'll say no more about it. Good night. Is that you, Bernie? It's only me. Mary, could you come and help me with this lock, please? I c... I can't see it in the dark here. Thank you. Good night, Mary. I know. Yeah, I know. He's common as dirt. Thank you. Oh, no. No, I mustn't... I mustn't... I mustn't talk to him. Oh, Sacred Heart! Oh, God! - I don't understand... - Mama's upset tonight. - Yes, but I don't understand. - Mama... Just one more. A wee one. Christ! Who's that? Is that you, Bernie? Ssh! Quiet. - Just be quiet, and there'll be no trouble. - No... Mister... please, no, mister. I'll shout. - Ssh, take it easy. Don't... - No... - Ssh, ssh, ssh, take it easy. - No! - I won't be a minute, I promise you. - No, please, don't... Please, please, please... Oh! Jesus. You stop worrying. Everything's going to be all right. It's okay. You okay? Just a little fun. It was just a little fun. I won't... I won't tell the missus. It's our secret. Just between us. Huh? ‚ô™ When you're smiling ‚ô™ When you're smiling ‚ô™ The whole world smiles with you ‚ô™ When you're laughing ‚ô™ When you're laughing ‚ô™ The sun comes shining through ‚ô™ But if you're crying ‚ô™ You bring on the rain ‚ô™ So stop your crying ‚ô™ Be happy again ‚ô™ Keep on smiling ‚ô™ When you're smiling ‚ô™ The whole world smiles with you ‚ô™ Keep on smiling ‚ô™ And the whole world smiles with you ‚ô™ Miss Hearne? Hello there! Miss Hearne! You all right, Miss Hearne? Yes... oh! Who is it? Mrs Rice. Are you sick? You all right? I... I was sleeping. There's a Mrs Brannon on the phone for you. Oh my God! I ju... Just... just a minute. I... I'm coming. Good morning. Afternoon, Miss Hearne. I hope you didn't catch a chill or something. You certainly slept a long time. I wasn't feeling very well yesterday. Sleep does me good. Oh, I hate to be sick myself. But then it seems to affect you fairly merrily. You were just singing away for hours last night, and talking on to yourself, happy as a lark. Miss Hearne speaking. Well, Miss Hearne, and about time too. Oh. Oh, Mrs Brannon, I'm... I'm terribly sorry. Yeah, I... I was ill. - There's no excuse... - I've been in bed all day. ...way to telephone. That's not good enough. Keeping my poor little Kathy waiting like this. - I want to know... - I'm so sorry. Really, really, I am. - You should be... - I'll come over straight away. - I'll... I'll be there in half an hour. - You don't need to come here at all. - Oh, no... - You needn't bother, I'll find someone else. No, Mrs Brannon, I am sick. I'll... I'll come anyway. You needn't bother. I'll find someone else. Oh, Mrs Brannon, please. Please, I... I can't re... Bad news? Oh, no. Oh, no. So are you a teacher or something? The lady told Mama her little girl was waiting for you. - I teach the piano. - Lost a pupil? I really must get out of this draughty hall. Mr Rice, would you know if Mr Madden has gone out? Oh, I forgot. My uncle was asking for you, but he's gone into town now. It's a pity you weren't up and about sooner. ‚ô™ Oh, when you're smiling ‚ô™ When you're smiling ‚ô™ The whole world smiles with you ‚ô™ - In fifteen minutes. - No. You're not past your time, are you now? Ah, you're all the same, aren't ya? You and that dirty old slabber of an uncle of yours. Always after it. So has he been visiting you, and you not telling me? Is that what you think of me? No, he hasn't. But I've seen him looking. Gives me the creepers. And if your ma finds out anything about you and me, she'll send me home quick enough. Because of that dirty slabber. I can fix it. - What? - Fix him. Uncle. So we get rid of him. And Miss Hearne, the old boozer. Bag and baggage, out. - How? - Trust me. Fifteen minutes. Hey! It's cold! It's cold! I confess to Almighty God, the Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and all thy saints. Blessed art thou, and blessed be the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Now, what's this, now? Don't you know this confession period's for the children? The children. Grown-ups from six to eight, my good woman. Not now. Yes, Father, I know that, but I had to come now. I had to confess. Are you in trouble, my child? It's drinking. Father, last night I lost all control. I see. You know that's a very bad habit, drunkenness. It leads to all sorts of sins. Yes, I... I... I had a lot of things that I was... unhappy about, and that started it. You must pray for forgiveness and strength, my child. Pray every day to our blessed Lord. Well, see, Father... I live alone. After my aunt died, it... it was too late. Well, I tried... I tried to get a job in an office, but all the places, they... they wanted younger girls. Well, I... I'm on my own a great deal, and... and sometimes I... I might take a drop. You know, to... to cheer me. You see, recently, Father, I met this man... Um... we're about to become engaged, but Father, oh Father, he lied. No... No, no, he didn't lie, but... No, he's a decent man. He's a churchgoer. Isn't that...? Doesn't that, you know... Doesn't that make it all right? I mean, if he'll be all right, then... won't it? Father? Now, my child. We shall never be lonely, because in God's sight we're never alone. Now make a good act of contrition, and I'll give you absolution. Ego te absolvo ab omnibus peccatus tuis in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. - Good morning. - Good morning to you. Ah, Miss Hearne. Mary! Miss Hearne's toast. We heard you were sick yesterday. Feeling better now, Miss Hearne? - Oh yes, thank you. - Sick, is it? Hmm! Singing and carrying on at all hours! Now it won't happen again, I'm sure. I like a bit of a song meself. I... I really must apologise to all of you. I didn't realise my singing voice carried so. The walls must be paper-thin. The walls are thick in this house. You'd have to shout at the top of your lungs to be heard through them. Well, I used to sing in the choir. In the church. Thank you, Mary. How about you, Mr Madden? Have you ever sung in the choir? No, I never did. I'd say you'd have a fine baritone voice. I'm dead tired after the other night. And I have to have my wits about me for teaching. We all must have a bit of a jig now and then. Caterwauling away half the blessed night. Caterwauling? - Is it me you're referring to? - Who else? And is it any business of yours what I do? It's a matter of common consideration to the people living in this house. Just so you know, this isn't your private public house. And from the sound of it the other night, you'd think you were... I'm very sorry. I promise you it won't occur again. Toast, Bernie? Jim! Jim. - Are you off to the twelve o'clock? - I don't think so. - You... you're not going to Mass at all? - No. Well... where are you off to? The lighthouse. To see the ships. I'd like to walk along with you. If that's all right? All right? Well, is that all right? It's your nickel. You'll be missing your holy hour. As a matter of fact, I've been wanting to talk to you. Maybe I will go to Mass. Fine. Fine. We can... we can go together. If... if you've no objection? No, we can cut back up there. I... I hope you won't think it forward of me, but... I've had the impression you were avoiding me. Where'd you get that idea? Well... you haven't been to breakfast for two days... I haven't seen you. I had business, that's all. I missed you. Happens I'm planning on going away. To Donegal. - To Donegal? - Yeah, I had a letter yesterday. From an old friend. Talking about a business deal. Not the quick lunch proposition. And when were you planning on running off to Donegal, may I ask? I'm not sure yet. You know, I am interested in what you do, Mr Madden. So you made up your mind to go to Donegal, and didn't have the decency to tell me. What's it to you, if I want to go to Donegal, or New York, or anywhere? I might even go to New York. New York? But you said you were going to stay here. - Why, only last week you said... - Last week was different. I don't see how. Last week I thought I had a partner in a restaurant deal. This week, I find out you've been stringing me along. Stringing you al...? - I don't understand. - Yeah? I hear from Bernie you're a measly piano teacher. Is that right? Yes, but I... I don't see what that has to do with it. - Everything. - Why? I need a partner in this quick lunch joint. I thought you was on the level. Well, are you? If you've got two thousand pounds, we can talk business. How about it? You wanna be partners with me? No. It's impossible. I can't do... See? Phony. Just like everybody else in this town. - But I never said... - It's okay. I'm off to Donegal. If that doesn't work out, I'm going back to the States. Christ, I should never have come here! I... I'd like to sit... sit down for a minute, please. I thought... you were interested in me, Jim. As a woman, I mean. I don't think you've behaved very well. "Well"? What do you mean, "well"? - I'm no dumb Mick, you know. - Oh, no. But you called me "phony". You... you took me out. You led me on to think... all sorts of things. God, you... You've got this all wrong. I... I... I took you out, sure. I thought you was a... thought you was a fine woman. I never made any passes, though, did I? I was a gentleman. Now get that straight. Then why...? It's that awful sister of yours, turned you against me with talk of my... my drinking, and goodness knows. I didn't need May to tell me you was drunk. I got ears. But it... it was because of you. She upset me with what she said about you. I... I... I had a drink to... to soothe my nerves. That's your business. Well, rest here a minute now. I'm not going to Mass. I'll see you later, okay? No! You... you think I'm a drunkard. You do, but it's not true. It's not true. I... I hardly ever touch it. That's... that's why it... I'd make you a good wife, Jim. Really, I would. I'd be a help to you. I don't care what you were. I don't care. I don't care. Whoever said anything about getting married? But I... Listen, Judy... get ahold of yourself. I like you. I thought of you as a good friend. That's all. Marry? At my age? At yours? Don't be crazy. Oh, my God! Oh, Mary, Mother of God, pray for us. Mother of God, pray for us. Mother of God, pray for us. Mother of God, pray for us. Oh, God... don't abandon me. Don't leave me alone. Give me faith, sweet Jesus. Give me thy eternal love. This isn't for all ears, but... last week, she as much as accused me of being a bad woman. A what? A bad woman. How in heaven's name could she say that? Well... you see, she... she has this brother visiting her. You know, an American. A Mr Madden. He's an older man, you know, and, well... he seemed very interested in me. Really? Sherry, Judy? Thank you, Moira, my dear. Go on, Miss Hearne. What about this American? Oh, Mr Madden? He's very nice. Well-behaved. He just pestered me to go out with him, so, you know, just to be polite, I... I did... I did go with him a couple of times. - To the pictures? - Una... Care for another, Judy? No, one is my absolute limit. But... there's... there's such a chill in the air today. One night, he took me to dinner at the Shelbourne. - Really? - Yes. Just friendly, you know. It's given me quite a rush. These last few weeks, I haven't even had time to visit my poor friend, Edie Marinan. She's so ill, you know, up in St Brigid's. Oh, that's quite a distance, isn't it? I should go out and see Edie one day soon. But Judy... what about this landlady giving you such trouble? Well... I could tell she was always jealous of her brother. She was worried about fortune hunters or something grabbing Mr Madden, but can you imagine the nerve of it? As much as telling me to my face that I was carrying on with him. Oh, no! No, it... it isn't funny. It was humiliating. Humiliating. I... I think I'll have another. It's awfully good sherry. Have a sandwich, or a biscuit, Judy. I will. I will, thank you, Moira, in a bit. What's this Madden like, Judy? A real dyed-in-the-wool Yank? No... not quite. No, there's... there's still a bit of the Mick about him. Anyway, this morning, he mumbled something about going to Donegal. A lie, obviously. I wouldn't be surprised if that sister of his put him up to it because before, he was all over me, you know? As a matter of fact, he... he proposed to me. He proposed to you? Yes. Yes, he did. And... and, mind you, Moira, I... I am aware that men don't grow on trees, but I... I just didn't feel we were quite suited to each other. Oh... his disappointment. Why don't you play something for us, Judy? Oh, you don't want to hear me play. Oh, please, Miss Hearne. Play some Chopin. Yes, please do, Judy. We haven't heard you play for a long time. I wish... I wish I'd brought my music with me. I'm so forgetful lately. Judy, what is it? I'm... I'm just so happy to be with a family, and feel that I belong. Oh, Judy! I was wondering... I have a sick friend... Is it gin, missus, or whisky? How much is the whisky? Two pound four. - But that's... - Make it quick, will you? The police'll be on us. Miss Hearne? It's Bernard Rice. I'm in bed. I have to talk to you. It's about my Uncle James. It's a very private matter. What are you...? How dare you come...? Miss Hearne, I so want to help my Uncle James and you. Spare me a few minutes, please. Well? Whisky! What about a drink, huh? All right if I use this toothmug? For happiness! What were you saying about Mr Madden? Oh, yes. You see, I'm interested in Uncle James' happiness. Well, in everybody's happiness in this house. It's important to my work. Did you know, Miss Hearne, this work that I'm doing, it's an epic poem. A great, great epic. I'm sure it is. May take five years. In the meantime, I am forced to live right here, and let Mama support me. An investment in immortality, so to speak. After all, that's what mothers are for, aren't they? What did you want to tell me about Mr Madden? Oh, yes. And now, Miss Hearne, I am going to reveal to you a very dark and passionate secret. My Uncle James... loves you. Yes, yes, he told me in confidence, I being his closest male kin. - No. - You mustn't say that I said it, but he wants to marry you. Couldn't be true. Just today, he said... harsh things. Ah, that's Mama's fault. She's been putting in the black word against you. It's true, then. I knew she must be poisoning Jim. Yes, Mama's a bitch. Poor dear, you won't believe this, but Mama actually told Uncle James that you said he wasn't g-g-g-good enough for you. Oh, I... I'd never... And he believed it. What with that grand, elegant manner that you have, he believed it. But if you want him, you'll have to go after him. He's proud. Fight for him. But, even if I... You're going to tell him that you love him, that you want to marry him. Keep on telling him, no matter what he says. Because he wants to. No, I would... I wouldn't dream... You won't catch a man by sitting in your room sopping it up, Miss Hearne. - What? - You want him. - You want him badly, don't you? - How dare you? You and I are gonna hook him, if you do what I tell you. What do you mean, hook him? Either that, or drink yourself into a madhouse. Get out of here! Get out, this instant! Christ, will you keep your voice down! Get out of this room, you filthy sneak! Plotting against people. What were you taught at school? - Where's your religion? - Religion? You think that God gives a damn about the likes of you and I? Stop it! Taking the holy name in vain! You get out of here! Get out this instant! Sssh! You're waking the whole house! You're waking the whole house! - Shut up! - Get out of my room! Get out of here, you rotten atheist! You sneak! Get out of here! - Shut up! - Get out! Look what you've done! You've made me spill it! - You've made me spill it! - Shut up! Shut up, for God's sake! I knew it. Her again. Mama, Mama, I just came in to see what was wrong, - and she's lying there. - Come on in, Jim. Have a look at your best friend. Oh, Christ! An accident? Accident, my eye. Drunk as a skunk. Well, out she goes tomorrow for sure, bag and baggage. She don't look hurt. We can't leave her lying here. Come on, give me a hand. Thank God Miss Friel is still out or I'd have lost two boarders instead of one. Get out of here, you filthy sneak! - Sober up! Have you no shame? - Lay off her. And you! I thought you were a man would tell me things to my face, not send a rotten fat atheist to do your work for you. - What's she mean by that? - She's off her rocker. Oh yeah? What do you mean by that, Judy? He said you wanted to marry me, were afraid to ask me. Why, Jim, why? What the hell's going on here? What are you screwing up? Believe me, it's nothing! Uncle James, please, you're breaking me arm! - You son of a bitch! - Don't hit him, Jim! Don't! - You're trying to get rid of me, huh? - No! Oh yes, you are. You told her lies so she'd run me right out of the house. Don't worry, I'm going. Now you can screw your little pecker off - with that whore in the attic! - Mama, he's telling lies. You wouldn't do that, Bernie. - Would you? - He would, and did. Every night, I expect. No, it was him. He was the one who nearly tore Mary to pieces himself. You're full of shit! That child is only sixteen. Sixteen? Christ. Oh, my God, the police could have you up for that, Bernie. Oh, you don't believe what he says, Mama darling? I don't want to hear any more. Let's go to bed. What about her? Let her lie. It's that woman that brought bad luck on this house. Mama, Mama! Oh, to think that a son of mine would do the like of that. Is that what you pick up at the university? When your father was alive, I know what he'd say... Wait till the Reverend Mother at the convent hears about you. She told you. She said it was Uncle James, not me. You're to bring her bed down to the scullery, - where I can keep an eye on her. - Yes, Mama. And you're going to confession tonight. Yes, Mama. It doesn't matter what you do in this world, Bernie. It's the next world that counts. Well, isn't that God's own truth. Fifty-four, fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven pounds, seventeen shillings and eightpence. - That closes your savings account. - Thank you. For what I owe, to the end of the week. And keep the change. First floor front. Is Mr Madden in, do you know? My Uncle James packed off early this morning. Bag and baggage, Miss Hearne. I don't suppose you know where he went? Nobody saw him. Back to little old New York, I wouldn't wonder. Just a minute. - Thank you. - Thank you. It's just your auntie's old tonic wine, so where's the harm? You won't even have to mention it in confession. It'll be our little secret, Edie. Don't tell me Father O'Malley's above having a wee sup of the holy stuff himself now and again. You're a wicked woman, Edie Marinan, so you are. But you're the only one who can make me laugh. Visiting hours are visiting hours, but as long as you understand it's just this once. And it's very kind of you to make an exception. Well, since you've come all the way out from Dublin in a taxi, and you're keeping it waiting and everything. She doesn't look any better, Sister. It's a terrible thing, arthritis. But who are we to question God's will? Edie... Edie. It's me. Judy. I was hoping you'd be back. Oh, I have missed you, Edie. Judy... do you have some? A little nip. Be careful. They're watching. Oh! If it isn't the holy water itself! Just lift me up. Ssssh, sh, sh. Oh! Oh, you're a saint, Judy. The heat will chase the pain away. I was wondering if you'd ever be back. Well... I do have a secret to tell you. Edie, this last few weeks, well... I was on my way to being engaged to be married. Judith Hearne! Ah, well, no. It's over. Quite. Probably he's the last. Why... why don't I have a nip to keep you company? Must have been wonderful, Judy. To have a man that loved you, even for a little while. God knows, if a man just happened to come by here, he'd find me the prettiest of the bunch. And that Sister over there, know who she reminds me of? The one who used to teach us geography, remember? Sister Ruth Nicholas. You... you used to call her... Sister Rude Knickers! Judy, a sup more holy water. Sister! Sister! Them women is drinking! Them two there, Sister! That one in the red hat. You dirty old hags! Just wait till I get ahold of youse! What exactly is going on here? Pains are bad, Sister. Leave me alone. And you, you'll have to leave now. I'm merely visiting my poor friend Edie Marinan, and with your permission. I give you no permission to come in here and feed a sick woman with that vile stuff. Anyone would think I was a criminal. Look at that one with the red coat! She's a wicked woman, Sister! I beg your pardon? Out. Out you go. I've a good mind to call a policeman. I'll be back, Edie. Father, help me! - Help me, please, help me! - Now pull yourself together! Get ahold of yourself now, Miss Hearne, and sit down. Father, please... - Is that gin I smell? - Yes, Father. Do you mean to say you've come here to see me drunk? No. No, no, Father. No, I'm not... I'm not drunk now. Honestly, honestly, I'm not. - Father, I need your help. - What kind of help? Father, I can't believe anymore. I'm all alone. I need a sign from God. You need to sober up, that's what you need. I... I can't pray. He... He won't listen. Father, all my life I have believed. I've... I've waited... Father, please. Please listen to me, please. Listen... I'm listening. I just don't feel God is there anymore. Father, you're a priest. You're sure He is there, aren't you? You're... you're really sure? Will you get ahold of yourself! You're not sure. I... but then, how can I... Father... if He's not there, if there's no other life... - I've wasted mine. - You should be ashamed of yourself! Ashamed to come in here, at this hour of the day, drunk. Talking that way about our Blessed Lord. A terrible, terrible thing. You go home now, and get down on your knees, and say a mouthful of prayers, and be grateful God hasn't punished you. Father, I've got to get this settled. - Can you please tell me... - That's enough, child! Enough! Go home, and sober up, and examine your conscience. Tomorrow evening, I'll be hearing confessions between six and eight. Come and see me then. We'll have a talk. You are from this parish? What's your name? You've a taxi waiting, I believe. He'll take you home. Where does that lady live? Oh, I picked her up at the Shelbourne Hotel, Father. I hate you! Are you really in there? Did you hear me? Open! Open! Open! Let me in! I want to be with you! Let me in, God! I want to be with you! The light! Quickly! Why would she do such a thing? I know a little bird could do better than that. You do want to get well now, and out of here, don't you? And you're happier now, Miss Hearne? Now that you've put all those black thoughts behind you. Isn't that so? Yes. Many's the time I think of those who don't believe, how lonely, alone, they must be. No friends around them, deliberately turning away from God's mercy. Help me, God... Help my unbelief. I'd be very glad to hear your confession now, if you like, Miss Hearne. Well, I must be getting home. The children... Moira... You and Owen have been so kind, taking care of this private room. Don't worry about it. Oh, Sunday just doesn't seem the same without you, Judy. All the children say so. You know, Moira, I never liked you. That's the truth. Well, I hope we can change all that. Now don't you bury yourself in this room. Get out, talk to some of the other patients. Why? Sister? Will they discharge me soon? As soon as you're well. But... I... I can stay here till then? Sure, but you are getting better. I wonder... would you put this on the mantelpiece for me, please? Is that your mother? It's my aunt. Is this picture the only you? Oh! The colours are so true! I wonder, would you happen to have a hammer, Sister? I have the hook. Well, um... we don't like to mark the walls. But why don't we put it over here? You can see them both together now. No matter what, they always make a new place home. God help us, it's not been easy trying to find the right place for you, Judy. Something pleasant. You and Owen have been so kind. Well, you know you'd be welcome to stay with us, but our house is bursting at the seams already. I've made a new start before, Moira, from time to time, and managed well enough. Why, Miss Hearne, you said you'd get dressed today, and go to Mass. I don't feel up to it, Sister. Well, anyway, I've got something for you. And you have a visitor. A Mr... - Madden? - Yes, Mr Madden. No, no, I can't, no. Tell him I can't. Well, he seems quite anxious to see you. Very well, Miss Hearne. Sister! Sister! You look well. Thank you. I, er... phoned a few times to see how you were. Um... would you mind if we went outside? I'm glad you're okay. I was so sorry, with... - Where did you go when you left? - Donegal. Little business venture that didn't work out. You wanna... you wanna sit down? Um... it's important to me that... you know, that we... you and me... clear the air. Be friends again. - Friends? - Sure. I miss our little talks. New York, that songwriter, Chopin... We had some good times, didn't we? So... Say we be friends again? Start afresh? That a deal? So you're all right? They're thinking of letting me leave. Oh, terrific! Um... Judy? You remember us talking one time about my idea? Opening an eating place in Dublin? You remember? An American quick lunch. Give the girl a cigar! Well, I've been thinking a lot about that. It would go over like gangbusters, Judy. And say we had a partnership. Not... not just in the place, but in other things as well. You know? Partners. Down the line. Are you... you saying that you... Mr and Mrs James Madden. Proprietors. Whaddaya say? - Oh, Jim! - Everything spelled out upfront. No misunderstandings. Partners. Fifty-fifty. You're expecting me to put money in this restaurant thing? Ah, not that much. A drop in the bucket for a lady that can afford to stay in the Shelbourne. You... you know I stayed there? Well, yeah. Bernie heard you tell the driver. I checked up. You checked up? Well, the Shelbourne. Bernie's known to tell a few. I told him you had class. Judy? Judy! What is it? God, you idiot! You great oaf! And I've been waiting for you. Years, I've been waiting. Years! Every one of them twelve months! Praying for it. Hoping. A woman never gives up her hopes. "There's always a Mr Right," they say. Changing as the years... the years go by. Well, you know he's tall, dark and handsome in the beginning, then... well, you're not so young, and he's middle-aged, and funny-looking, and common as dirt! So anybody, anybody so much as gives you a kind word, and that's your prince. Sent to keep you from being alone. And love? Oh, that's forgotten. You're just supposed to take him, even though you know, you know he doesn't want you. All he wants is an American quick lunch! But Judy, we do have things in common. You're a fine woman. Do you see me as a woman, Jim? Why, sure! At least we're doing something together. Together's something. So's alone. It doesn't mean you're nobody. You don't exist. - Oh, Judy, come on. - Stop it, please. Stop it. - There's no money. - Hmm? I have no money! What about the Shelbourne? It's the last of my savings. All that's left is a small annuity. It wouldn't even open the doors of your restaurant. - Is that true? - Yes. You'd better start facing it. I've had to. Well, I... you know, I'm trying to. Do you still want to be partners down the line, Jim? Well, shall... shall we go back now? Um... I'm not living at May's anymore. She... she rented the room. For money, she said. I got a... got a new place. And a job. Well... sort of a job. It's just driving a van, really. No more green Studebakers. But this new place of mine... you know, you might like it. Well, my... my friends the O'Neills have found somewhere for me. I, er... wrote down the address. Just in case. - Well, goodbye. - Yeah. I'll see you. Oh, and Father Quigley said to tell you he expects you at early Mass on Sunday. No excuses, now. Does he? - Thank you, Sister. - You forgot these! I wish you such happiness, Miss Hearne. Thank you, Sister. SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
