Is this the right place? I'm alright. I can do this. Alright, let's do this. This is Kim Soyeon reporting. Yesterday I was contacted by a man, Park Sangjoon... who reportedly broke out of a psychiatric institute and killed 18 people. Ah... Actually, Park and I were childhood friends. Park Sangjoon (age 27, male)" I remember him as a kind boy. However, after a traumatic event at the age of 10, he became mentally unstable and was sent to a facility. I never met him since then but... somehow he came to contact me through my publisher. I recorded his call. It's me, Park Sangjoon... Park Sangjoon? From primary school? Yeah, it's me. Sangjoon. This is Soyeon, right? Yes... Oh, thank god, thank god... What's going on? All that stuff on the news... is it really you? I... I'm in a serious situation... Soyeon. Do an exclusive on me. An exclusive? Yeah, but you can't tell anyone and... I want just 2 people. You and a Japanese cameraman. Japanese? Chief Clinician KimXX (57, male) and escaped." I can speak Japanese, too... Why a Japanese cameraman? I'll tell you later. "Murdered a couple living in Kwangmyung City, with knife." Okay, I know one person, so let me ask him. thrown away in a nearby garbage can." Alright, and also... I want you to take everything in one cut without turning the camera off. Um, Okay. I've been here at the meeting place for 30 minutes now. He should be calling me anytime soon. Hello? Sangjoon? Yeah, it's me. Are you filming? Yes, we are. Good. Then, I want you to leave the alley and turn right. Okay. Do you see an old apartment? Yeah... Head towards the apartment. Okay. Are we meeting inside the building? Yeah. You're not with the cops, are you? No. I didn't call them. Nobody knows except me and the cameraman. If you're worried, I can leave. No, no. I trust you. I have no choice anyway. I never thought I'd be seeing you again. True. Are you okay? It's cold, isn't it? Yeah... it's cold... a little tired... Are you staying warm? No... not really. Okay... I have a hand warmer with me if you need it. Yeah... thanks. You're the same. Huh? I mean, you haven't changed. You neither. Things were really fun back then. We used to hang out with Yoonjin. The three of us. We played house quite often... Yeah. I always had to play the "son" made to run errands. But it was fun, right? Yeah. I'm almost there. I'm in front of the apartment now. Okay. Just like our old haunted house game... get inside quickly and take a left. Come up to the 5th floor. I'm hanging up now. "Kumli Apartment" "Danger. Do not enter" He sounds the same, like nothing's changed. Still easy to talk to. I don't get it. He doesn't sound mentally ill. Right? I don't think he's going to harm us. Hm... We should be careful. "Kumli 502" Soyeon? Don't move! Don't move! Soyeon, use this. Open the door quickly! If you don't, I'll kill you. Open it! Don't move. Don't move. Get in. Get in! You too! Get in! Hurry. Hurry up! Key... Put the key here. Here! Get in. Now! Don't move. Soyeon, you sit on the chair. Sit. Phone... Give me your phone. You too. I'll give it back when we're done. Don't worry. Cameraman. No matter what happens, don't stop. Keep recording. If you stop, I'll kill you. If you miss anything, I'll kill you too. If that camera stops, you die! Alright! I got it! You're living here? Yeah. It's been a while since I came here. It's cold, isn't it? Use this. This is the hand warmer? Yeah... You've never used one before? Here, let me. You see... If you shake it like this, it'll get warm soon. Thanks. You're a good person. You're a good person too, right? Can I take notes? I brought some questions for you. Okay. Why... did you need a Japanese person? I'll explain later. Okay... Then, let's get this straight first. Did you... kill 18 people? As reported in the media? Yeah... well... It's true I killed 18 people... but there are actually more. It's 25. What happened? I threw them into the Han River. Maybe, their bodies didn't come up yet. Why in the world would you Kill... 25 people? Why? Well... I happened to come across this magazine and... About a controversial factory closing. The reporter wasn't intimidated by powerful interests. She wrote exactly what she saw and felt. After reading the article, I thought... that this person might be able to believe what I say. But Soyeon, I was really surprised to see who wrote the report. Camera. Kim Soyeon. Yeah... Thanks... for seeing me in such a nice way. Soyeon, you know about my childhood and... You'll listen to me, right? I'm here, aren't 1? I read a lot of books and watched a lot of movies in the hospital. I'm not stupid. I'm not dumb. Look! Conversation... We're having a normal conversation, right? Yeah. Listen to me. I really don't want to kill anybody! But I have no choice. Why is that? Well, We were meant to reunite this way. Soyeon. What I have done... is connected to you as well. What are you talking about? Look at this. Sangjoon, Soyeon, ready? Yeah, ready. Do you remember this? When we were kids... I took this with Yoonjin's camcorder. Come on! You should try too. Stop filming me! Green light, green light... Red light! Green light, green light... Yoonjin! Yoonjin! It's sad but it's all in the past now. It's not past for me! l...I'm sorry. Soyeon. This video... I never wanted to show anyone. So... I hid it in a secret place. The playground we used to go to. Remember our secret base? I went there a few days ago and it was still there. I really liked her. Sangjoon. What does this have to do with the things you did? Look. Soyeon. Ever since I buried the tape... I started hearing the voice from god. After the incident... what did you hear about me? I heard from my parents that you became unstable... and had to go to the hospital. I see. In what way? What did they say? I heard... that you said there's something you had to do for Yoonijin. You kept crying that out. But you never told anybody why. Yeah, yeah... that's right! I wasn't unstable! I was just hearing god's voice! Listen. When I buried the tape, I heard the voice... telling me that when I turn 27, if I kill 27 people... Yoonijin will come back. And... it's not just once or twice I heard that. Hundreds and thousands of times over and over again! The more I missed Yoonjin, the louder the voice became. Soyeon. I waited so long to turn 27. And after finally turning 27, I ran away from the hospital. After breaking out, the messages started getting more descriptive. Who to kill, how to Kill... I keep getting hints. Sometimes... he even tells me where I should hide. See? That's why I haven't been caught and am here right now! Sangjoon. The voice of god you heard... It's all in your head. It's not! Even after I entered the hospital... I kept hearing the voice! I kept hearing it. Soyeon, I... I was there for 17 years. In the hospital, everyone was crazy, except me! Sangjoon. Killing people won't bring Yoonjin back. No, no. She's going to come back. She's definitely coming back. How on earth is that going to happen? I... I don't know how. Only god knows... I don't know. Sangjoon. You already... killed 25 people. You said you need to kill 27. Come to think of it... You're with 2 people right now. Soyeon, no, no. Don't get me wrong. I'm not going to kill you. Hey, yeah. Have you seen the classic American movie, "It's a Wonderful Life?" How about you? I don't know. Okay. They showed it at the hospital on Christmas. It was really touching. It goes like this. An angel... teaches a broken man about the value of life. It's a great movie. It touched me so deeply. After I saw it, I decided... to film a movie about how I brought Yoonjin back to life. Then everyone who sees the movie... will understand what I had to do. I'll show them the truth through the movie. And this is the movie. I want you to record all the miracles that will happen from now. This will be a documentary that vindicates everything I said and did. You mean... you're going to film your murder? Soyeon. Killing someone... is really scary. Can't do it alone anymore. Let's say... Yoonijin really does... come back to life. Do you seriously think it's right to kill 27 people... to save just one? No, I don't. But you see, Soyeon. God told me... that when everything's over, everyone I killed will come back, too. I must finish what I started. So... Those people I killed... I have to bring them all back, don't I? You really believe that? Yes. I do believe that. Anyway, after leaving the facility... God kept showing me miracles. Then show them to me. The miracles. Yeah. Right now. Right here. On camera, a true miracle will happen. Because Yoonjin... and everyone I killed will come back to life. Then, you'll believe me, Soyeon. From now? Yeah. God told me... that I need to gain the power of love from the last 2 people. Yes, the power of love. That's what he told me. After seeing this power of love... I will kill them. Soyeon, believe me! Please. But... I jumped the gun and made a terrible mistake. Before god told me who to Kill, I kidnapped a couple that seemed to be in love. It's just... that I felt like god was telling me to do so. Kidnapping 2 people... is not that easy, right? What happened to them? I hurt them... to see if they love each other. But they just tried to save themselves. There was no love between them. So... you killed them? No, I didn't. I'm just waiting for god to tell me what to do. Soyeon, come here. Cameraman, you too. Come, come here. Come quick. Over here. These people were not the ones I was looking for. But... thanks to them, I found the right answer. A magazine fell from the man's bag. It opened to your article. So I met these people to find this. This gave me the information about the last 2 people. After finding this out, I called you. It's just an article. Then I'll make it easier to see. Okay? This way. Come inside. Wait, wait. Soyeon, come here. You, film this. Hey! I said film! Lo..ve... from... Ja..pan. Love from Japan. Man... Young woman. The Japanese woman loves the man. A young couple. 19th... that's today. 15... 1500 hours. 40... 40 minutes. 32... 32 seconds. 3:40pm and 32 seconds. Kumli 502... Kumli Apartment Room 502. Soyeon. I was already in room 502 before I even found this magazine. Spots on the neck... 2 people. Kill... them. It's almost time. You! I needed you here for this, got it? I need to know what they are saying to check their love. That's crazy. This is going too far. It might seem that way. Soyeon. When my watch hits 3:40:32, all we need to do is wait for a Japanese couple to show up. That's insane. No. They will come. I don't know why they would come all the way here, but they'll just come. How can you believe something you don't even understand? Okay, then. We can't explain every mystery in outer space. But they surely exist, right? I'll know exactly what to do with that couple very soon. God talks to me all of a sudden. When least expected. That's my phone... Yoonho. Who's that? Someone I know from the publisher. Really? Then pick it up. But on speaker phone. God's message will be in this call. You! Don't say a word. And you two! Keep your mouths shut. Or I'll kill you. You too, got it? Pick it up. Hello. Hi, it's been a while. It's Kim Yoonho. I called... What? Hello? I can't hear you. Ki.. the... two.. peo... ...ple Heard that? Kill the two people. God's message. That's crazy. It's just a coincidence. Then why look so astonished? Listen to your heart. No! This is just a coincidence. This can't justify killing someone. Yes, it can! You just don't understand. Not with normal human comprehension. But we ARE human beings, Sangjoon. Yoonijin is dead. It already happened and is in the past now. No! It's not over for me. At least for me. Why? Because I know how to bring her back. She is already dead. Sangjoon. You're... sick right now. Right? Soyeon, go over there. Now! Hurry up. Now! Put your hands behind your back. Sangjoon. Now. Just do as I say! Now! You, get back. Get back! Soyeon, put your hands behind your back. Turn around. Hurry! Hey! Shut up. Don't move. Get back! Don't move. Soyeon, hands behind your back. Now! Sangjoon, don't do this. It's just a small cut. It's going to bleed only a little bit. Don't worry. Sorry. No. Sangjoon, please. Quiet! Be quiet. Sangjoon. There's no time! We have to get this done before the Japanese couple comes. No, Sangjoon, don't! Soyeon, just let me be! Trust me. Just trust me, please. No, No. Mr. Tashiro, stop him! Now! Stop him now! Don't move. No, Sangjoon. No time. No! Sorry. No! Please stop Sangjoon. If I block the artery like this. you can die in your sleep. I know I am doing something really cruel... Sorry. I am really sorry. No, please Sangjoon. Please stop. Stop! No. I know, I know. This is too much to just pass off as a coincidence. But it doesn't mean Yoonjin will come back. Please stop. No! God gave me an answer. I believed in and followed him for 17 years. I saw ants line up to make the number 27. And on my 27th birthday, I saw... 27 pigeons dead in the garden. No. We don't have time. You really have to...? Go away! Get back! Sorry, I'm sorry. Murderer... Murderer. Murderer! Sangjoon, please stop this and just give yourself up. Repent your sins. In nature, there is no repentance. I don't listen to the laws of man. Okay, okay. I'm sorry. Sangjoon, I'm sorry. I know, you were alone and had to go through everything by yourself. I'll be here for you. So please. Stop, Sangjoon. Sangjoon... What you just said really means a lot. But Soyeon, this is different. In a few minutes, 2 Japanese people will come. When that happens, you stay here. Cameraman. You hide there until I give you a sign. Then talk to them, got it? What? What am I supposed to say? I don't care, say anything. They're here. Soyeon. Look closer and accept the reality. Listen to your heart. - - - - - - Hey, you! Tell them to sit in the chair. the chair> Camera, what are you saying? He's trying to convince them to listen to you. and listen to that freak > Hey! What's he saying? Tell me! What's he saying? He said they'll stay quiet so don't harm them. Alright, sit down. Hurry! I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.> Hey! What's he saying? Those two are on their honeymoon. They're really worried. Sangjoon, please. It's not too late to stop. Honeymoon... Good, then they care for each other. Love... love! No! No! Don't! Don't! Soyeon, help me! with a stick? How stupid are you?> It's almost finished. Almost done. Help me... Good. This is love. Soyeon, you see that? That's love. Thanks, thanks. Sangjoon! Hey! Sit in the chair. Tell her to sit in the chair. Tell her I'm gonna smack his head off if she doesn't. Stay still! Stay there! Just sit down and be quiet! Stay put. Let go! Get off me! The guy... tie him up. Tashiro, no. No, if you do this, you're guilty too. Soyeon, you be quiet! Do as I say now! Alright... Alright. You! Cameraman! Do it quick and tie the girl up too. Knees, ankles, everything. And sit her down. Now. Soyeon, this is a miracle. Just like the message from god, a Japanese couple came here. And those two... really love each other. Now do you believe me? Listen to your heart. Say something. Still a coincidence? Still no meaning, huh? It has to be just a series of coincidences. Coincidence? Then how do you explain what just happened? I don't know! You can't! So... you're saying there is no meaning? I don't know! All I know is that a bunch of coincidences happened and... How? How can all of these "coincidences" happen the way I predicted? Don't you think it's too precise to be a coincidence? No! I don't know! I don't know... You! What do you think? Take this. You think this is all a coincidence? I filmed a lot of supernatural things in Japan, so... Things you wouldn't believe. And? So, I think all that's happening with you... has some mysterious power behind it. Really? Yes, really. Thank you. But... Can't we stop the killing? It's too much for me. That's your damn problem! I want to stop too. This all has to end today. I'll finish today and all will be restored. You... What's your name? Ta... Tashiro. Okay. Tashiro. Thanks. You are the first person to believe me. Soyeon, why can't you believe me? You are going through an amazing experience right now. If there is a god like you say... why would he want such a terrible thing? What? Why kill innocent people and save Yoonjin? I don't know. I told you I don't know. I want to know the reasons too. But I'm just moving with faith I have no choice. I just do as I am told. Then everything will be alright. Just... as I am told. But still... this is too much. Don't you think so? It's crazy. For a normal person... A normal person can't do such things. Yeah, what I am doing... is crazy. I know that. But... to have a miracle, we have no choice. Soyeon, you just stay there and watch. And I know, your eyes are already telling me that you believe. Your article brought me all the way here after all. You mean... I'm responsible for this too? Yeah. You are also a part of this miracle. Sangjoon. I... I trust you. Really? Yes. If I can be of any help, I'll cooperate. Soyeon. So, can't you at least untie these? Soyeon, why do you lie to me? What are you talking about? I can tell by just looking at your eyes. You're thinking of either freeing these people or calling the police. No. Yeah. It kinda makes me sad. But I'll try to understand. Now! Let's... check the article message and see... if they have those spots on their necks. Spots! No spots? Why? Hey. What's he saying? He is asking if you are going to kill them. Tell them, I will kill them and they will come back to life. Spot! Spot! Why is there no spot! Look... look here. It says there are two spots on the neck. Isn't it possible that you just saw what you wanted to see? It might not be a message from god. No! God told me for sure. Neck. Spots. Two of them! He told me. I saw them. Then, maybe you misunderstood the meaning? Yeah, the meaning! Do you know how to decipher it? No, I don't. I don't know. Deciphering can wait. First... I need to make sure they are in love. Now. Tell him, if he wants me to stop, he needs to hang himself with this rope. Tashiro. Translate or die. Your choice. Huh? I'll do it. Hang yourself with that rope. Bend your knees and let your weight pull you down. What are you going to do? What are you doing? No! Sangjoon! Stop! Hey, I said stop! Love! The power of love. Show it to god. Show it. He said he is going to watch. What? All right, then. Can you love, even after seeing her go through this? Can you love her? What...? Sangjoon. No! Sangjoon! Sangjoon, please don't do this. Please don't... please... Tashiro! Film this! Okay. What's so funny? Ah... he is making fun of you. Make fun.... make fun? Sangjoon! Sangjoon! Please think about it. If a miracle happens like you say and Yoonjin comes back. And say she grows up. But then some guy appears one day claiming god's miracles. And does the same thing to Yoonjin. How would you feel? Then, I'll just have to fight him off! I'm seeing this through. If you go any further, I will honestly hate you for real. Okay. If you have to hate me, so be it. No...No. Please... No. What's he saying? He said, if you can really do what you say in front of him. he'll go ahead and die. What the hell are you saying, dammit! He thinks... you can't do it. No... No... Tashiro! You! You! Sangjoon, you need to stop now. Yeah, let's finish this. Kill those two, and bring things back to the way they were. Those two didn't have what you were looking for. The spots... I'll strangle them. Then, they will be bruised and will have the spots. All I need to do is strangle them. No, that's not right, Sangjoon. - What? - You're wrong. According to what you said, these two are supposed to show the power of love. That's already been shown. And, there are definitely spots... on the two who have to die. What are you saying? You knew this would happen, right? Since seeing that code in your article, you knew... who has to die. And who has the spots. That Japanese... Those two Japanese! All I need to do is kill them. What...? Ever since Yoonjin's death, I had this. It kept getting bigger and bigger. And I just saw a moment ago... I noticed that you have the same spot. What? You didn't know? Spot... Spot? Tashiro, come here. Take a look. You see a spot? You have the same spot. Huh? The last two people to die are, you and me. You kill me, and... then you kill yourself. I'm fine if I have to die but... I have to kill you, Soyeon? You can't turn back now, can you? What do I do? No, don't! Hey! Stop it! Tashiro! No. Hey! Look here! Over here! Ah! Soyeon. Soyeon. Soyeon. Soyeon. a I don't want to die in such a dark place. Please... take me somewhere brighter. Okay... Thank you. It's okay. What? It's okay to kill me. If I die this way, it won't be by your hands. Then, it becomes different from your message from god. Then... everything would have been for nothing. I don't want to die in vain. Don't waste me away. Please... I hope your miracle comes true. If... If Yoonjin comes back, and you and I come back... then let's... the three of us... let's go watch a movie together. A movie with a happy ending. Okay? Thank you, Soyeon. Thank you for believing in me. I, I'll end up alone again but... you'll be back. A miracle will happen. It's going to happen. Then we'll all be together again. We'll go to the movies, the three of us. I promise... Soyeon. You finally believe me, and I kill you? I'm a psychopath. A crazy murdering psychopath. God... Oh god... God. Please... Please bring them back. If... If I die and... nothing happens... then... I'm never going to forgive you. Please witness that I am not just some crazy murderer, but a man who brought a miracle. Please watch. The only person who can see this now is... ...you. Only you. Soyeon, its god. Oh! It's god! Where, where... Where am 1? I'm here. "December 24th, 1996" It's... it's that day. Yes it's that day. Soyeon... here, Soyeon... Yoonijin... When we went to see Yoonjin... Yeah, this alley. This alley! Yes, when we go to see Yoonijin... Ah! Yoonjin... Yoonijin is alive. Hey, hey! You can't be here. Go away. Over there! Over there! Yeah, Yoonjin, you can't be here. Go with your friends. Hurry. Are you okay? Me? I'm okay. Yoonijin, you go now. Go. What about you? No, I have to stay here. Go quickly. Yeah, go! Go! Go! Go! Go! I have to kill myself. That's the only way to end this. But then, nobody will ever see my movie... What the! What's this? What is it? Did it fall from somewhere? I don't know. It just appeared out of nowhere. You're not hurt, are you? I'm fine. We use these for interviews you know. Oh my, our journalist Kim Soyeon at it again... I think it's broken. Right? It's dirty, broken, and kinda done for, right? Let me see. Huh? Here. It's kinda heavy. What's wrong Yoonjin? Are you alright? I don't know... Thank you, Sangjoon. Get a room, you two! It's almost time, let's go. You're already emotional before the movie even started? Let's go. Isn't all of this kinda like a happy ending to a movie?
