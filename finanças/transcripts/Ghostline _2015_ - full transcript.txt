Here we are. Alright, check out the new crib. Not bad, now if we were only closer to L.A. We're only two and a half hours away, just think Chels'. No more rent... no more nosy apartment managers. No more eviction notices, I get it. It was very thoughtful of your Aunt Evelyn to bequeath it to you. God rest her soul. And what I really love about it. When my mom comes to visit, she's going to have her own room. Um. So... what do you think? Well, it could definitely use a decorators touch. My only real beef, is the lack of plumbing in the second bathroom. Don't worry, we're going to get that fixed when we have the money. Remember, like I said this is just for a year or two. Until the market picks up, then we'll flip the house and move back to L.A. Ya, I just hope we can find some work in this town. Don't worry, everything's going to be okay. Your lawyer was right about the cellphone service out here. Still can't get a signal? Only if I stand out in the street, and turn a certain way. What's the problem? I don't know, he said it might have something to do with the local power plant or something. That sucks, what are we going to do for phone service? I guess we just spring for a landline. - Hey. - Hey, what you doing? - Just updating my resume. - Ya? - Yeah. - Any luck with the back door? - No it still won't open. - Mm, okay. - I'm going to hit the sack. - Okay I'll be right there, I love you. Love you... oh. - What time's our first interview tomorrow? - Eleven. Yes hello, you've reached the Tyler Jantzen and Chelsea Watkins residence. How may I be of assistance to you? Hello. Really? Hello? I'm sorry can you, can you hear me right now? I'm going to hang up, okay? Hello Eric. I'm sorry, you've got the wrong number. Hey, don't even think about pulling that shit on me. I know it's you. Trust me lady, there's no Eric here, have a good night. Jesus. - What? - Why did you hang up on me? Look, there's no one called Eric at this number, so stop calling okay. Eric, it's Ellen. I don't give a shit what your name is, I'm not Eric, so stop calling me. - Good morning. - Good morning. You making another one of your seaweed concoctions? Ya. - Want some? - No thanks, I'll pass. Ah by the way, we had 36 voicemails this morning. Really, from who? Not sure, but I think it was the same chick who called last night. - What did she say? - Nothing. All she does is breathe into the phone, then hang up and call back. Weird... did you save any of them? Nope... cleared them all. When was the last time she called? 4:30, nothing since then. Hmm, maybe she gave up on us. Are you sure you don't want some of this? Look, I love you, but that is disgusting. Just a little bit. Look, I'm going to drink my coffee like a normal human being. This is better for you. Please, if you make me drink that, I'm going to throw up all over you. Please, please, please. Boring. Yes... I completely understand. Thank you very much for your time anyway. Bye. So, what was the reason this time? Same thing as last time, no local references. Well... how in hell are we supposed to have local references if no one will hire us without them in the first place? I think there's more to it than that. I say for future interviews we don't mention we're actors from L.A. that need to available to go on auditions because in small towns like this, they don't get people like us. Okay, so basically we're screwed if we find a job, and screwed if we don't. - Yeah, pretty much. - Okay. - Babe. - What? We're kind of in the middle of dinner. No we're in the middle of eating Romaine lettuce which I don't think constitutes dinner. - You're shitting me. - Don't answer it. No babe, if it's her she's just going to keep calling and calling. - Just unplug it. - No, I'm going to nip this in the bud right now. - Hello. - Eric. Why are you ignoring me? Look lady, I have tried to be nice about this but I have told you over and over again, there is no one named Eric who lives at this number, so stop calling us or we're going to be forced to call the police. What do you mean, "us"? Is someone there with you? That's none of your business, are you going to stop calling here, or what? You have a woman there, don't you? Okay, have a good night, bye. Psycho. This is getting, ridiculous. Look, in the morning, I'm just going to call-- You know what, allow me. Look Ellen, or whatever the hell your name is you're starting to be a royal pain in the ass. Stop calling us! Put Eric back on the phone, bitch! Lady, are you deaf? There is no Eric here! Liar, give him the goddam phone! We definitely need to unplug it. Man... - How many were there? - 58. - Any messages? - No. Just heavy breathing like last time. What are we going to do? What the hell is a ghostline? It's a line you can make phone calls from, without having a specific number. And there's no way to trace it? No sir, I'm afraid not. How is that even possible? It's hard to explain. Would you like to speak with my supervisor? No, that's not going to be necessary. Look, can you just tell me who had the number before us? Sorry, but we're not allowed to give out that kind of information. But what I can do is provide you with a new phone number. That should solve your problem. Perfect. And, boom goes the dynamite. Oh no. Is that Heather? No it's another unknown caller. Well, go ahead and answer it. It can't possibly be that Ellen bitch. Put it on speaker. - Hello. - Dude. Took you long enough to answer. - Catch you sleeping? - Hey Bobby, what's up man? Just checking in to see how you two are doing in the new digs. Oh yeah, everything's cool. Hey, how come your name didn't come up on the caller I.D? Oh it's this new cellphone, I'm still trying to figure it out. - Bobby it's Chelsea. - Hey Chels', what's shaking? It's all good, we miss you guys. Oh we miss you too... hey hold on a sec man, I got another call. Alright. Crap, this thing ain't working... I'll call you back in a few, okay? Okay, take your time man. Oh, I can't wait to find out if Heather got that part on Serenity Falls. I know, I just hope she had a better experience with that casting director than you did. Because he seemed more interested in your tits, than in your acting ability. Actually, he was kind of cute for an older guy. Yeah right. Hey bud, that was quick. Hello. Did you really think you could get rid of me that easily? Mr. Jantzen, other than identifying herself as Ellen. Did she reveal any information, such as, where she lives, or where she works? - No. - Mrs. Jantzen, how many times did you actually talk to her? Once, and my last name is Watkins. - But you can call me Chelsea. - And I'm Tyler. Ok, Tyler and Chelsea. Let me get this straight, phone calls started right after you moved in. Yeah, they started the first night we got the landline. - And they've all been at night. - That's correct. And what was the word the phone company used? - Ghostline? - Right. What I don't understand is how this woman got your new number. Welcome to the club. Have you noticed any suspicious looking women around the neighborhood? No, we haven't been outside much though. I see, where are you folks from? L.A. I just inherited the place from a relative who unexpectedly passed away. Oh, well I'm sorry for your loss. That's okay. Well, I'll talk to the phone company and see if there's anything else they can do. Detective Tanner, what if she calls again tonight? Until we figure out who this woman is I suggest you don't answer any unknown calls. But she'll just keep calling back. - Unplug it. - Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be in touch. So, where did you decide? I was thinking, maybe we could try that Mexican place over by the bowling alley. As long as they have strong Margaritas. Yeah babe, I like that style. I thought you would. We're home. Thank you. Easy, easy. Easy, easy, oh. Oh... should have stopped after three. You think? What I think is. - I'm gonna hurl. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh no, not tonight. No. No. - Did you say 82? - Yup. And just like before, all we can hear is heavy breathing. Well, I'm no psychologist but, we might be dealing with a psychopathic insomniac who has a fixation on this Eric guy and she's refusing to believe you're not him. What can we do about it? If we identify her, we can take the appropriate legal steps to force her to stop harassing you. How do you plan on identifying her? That's going to require some effort on your part. But as an actor... it shouldn't be a problem. So how do you want me to handle this? Well, try to get her to talk about herself. Maybe she'll slip up and tell us where she lives. Detective, did you find out who had our original number before us? I did, it belonged to... Patrick and Maggie Detweiler. They gave it up when they moved about eight and a half years ago. And it's been inactive since then? Yeah... oh and I found out how she got your new number. Some idiot at the phone company put in a change of number notification. So, anyone who calls the old number, automatically-- - It's her. - Put her on speaker. Hello... is anyone there? Who were you expecting? What do you want, Ellen? I want you, Eric. Yeah, I get that, but like I've been trying to tell you. I'm not Eric. Why do you keep saying that? Because it's the truth. Stop lying. Of all your undesirable traits that's the one I've always hated the most. Look Ellen, if this Eric dude is such a terrible guy then why do you still want him? That woman's still there, isn't she? Er, what woman? You know who I'm talking about. No, I'm home alone. Liar! I bet she's listening in. Look Ellen, it's just you and me on the phone, okay. Now if you'll just tell me where you are-- Jesus. How was that? Hello... Ellen are you still there? We're trying your call again. Bitch hung up. This is the first thing I thought, that woman is utterly delusional. Oh, she is worse than delusional. - This chick is unhinged! - Yeah, no shit. What do you want me to do next time she calls, what do you want me to say? Something to draw her out. I got it. Tell her that she's right, and that you've just been playing with her. You want me to falsely admit that I'm this Eric guy? Exactly... and then ask to meet her somewhere in public. I don't like that idea. Yeah, I'm not crazy about it either. You want to find out who she is, or not? Alright... yeah if that's what you think is going to take to end this nightmare. Excellent. Well, it's been over an hour. If she doesn't call soon I'm going to have to leave. I understand. Here we go. Hello. Is she gone. - Yes, I made her go home. - Good. Where are you? In a very dark place. I see. Look, I'm sorry I made you angry earlier, I was just messing with you. Of course... I'm Eric. - I know. - And I'd like to see you again. So maybe I could meet you in a bar, or a coffee shop? Oh don't worry, you'll be seeing me soon enough. What does that mean? I'm going to find you, Eric. And when I do. I'll make you pay for what you did to me. What the hell are you talking about? Hello? Hey, Ellen? She's gone. Due to the nature of the threat, Detective Starr will be working with me henceforth. - Happy to have you aboard, detective. - Thank you. After conferring with detective Tanner this morning I got to thinking, how many young women by the name of Ellen could there be living in a community of thirty two thousand? And... Surprisingly, there's over a hundred. However, only two of them match the profile we've created for this particular person. And unfortunately they both have alibis for last night. So where does that leave us? We asked our boss to authorize posting a squad car outside your home. However, he turned us down. It's a resource issue. But, here's the good news. We believe that if Ellen actually saw you she'd know right away that you're not Eric. We believe it's entirely possible that your voices are similar and that's why she's pursuing him. But, just to be on the safe side we recommend that you install a hi-tech security system. We're barely making ends meet as it is. We simply can't afford it. Well do you own a gun? No... no. We never like to encourage anyone to bring a weapon into their home but in this case, you may want to consider it. Sorry, not an option. Well then all we can suggest is that you keep all your doors and windows locked at all times. And don't go out at night unless it's absolutely necessary. Actually we were going out tonight. Here's to four years of unwedded bliss. And they said it wouldn't last. Can't believe we're actually toasting with water. After the other night, I don't even want to look at booze for a while. I hear ya. Ok. Don't look now. But some chick is staring at you from across the room. - Seriously? - I said don't look. You don't think it's Ellen, do you? - Why don't you go ask her? - What would I say? I don't know, how about, "are you the psycho bitch from hell, who thinks I'm Eric?" The detective said that Ellen is looking for Eric, not me. Okay, get up and walk to the bathroom. - But I don't have to go. - I just want to see what she does. Fine, I'll go wash my hands, okay? - You're food is coming right up ma'am. - Thank you. Sure you don't want something from the bar? Positive. - What happened? - She just took a picture of you. Terrific. Detective Tanner, this is Chelsea Watkins. Yeah, we're fine, but listen. I think we might have found Ellen. See ya, bitch. - Si. - Muchas gracias. Gracias. - So we'll wait, yeah? - Yeah. - Evening folks. - Hey detective. Thanks for coming, have a seat. Well? Her name is Tammy Edwards. Her divorce is final today. And she thinks Tyler's hot. I get that a lot. Oh, here we go. Sorry to waste your time detective, we appreciate you coming down. No worries, it's my job. Speaking of which, are you two still looking for work? I hate working banquets, unless I get to bartend. Still, it was sweet of detective Tanner to recommend us. Huh! - No calls. - Ah, would you look at that. Maybe she got the message. One can only hope. Oh man, I am going to sleep in so late tomorrow. No arguing here. Huh. Nothing. Come on... shit. Where's the flashlight? Uh, in the kitchen drawer. - Chels'. - What? Come here, quick. If you're looking for the coffee, it's inside the-- Holy shit! - What happened? - You tell me. How am I supposed to know? I didn't even open the fridge last night. I'm going to check the doors and windows. Everything's locked up, there's no way anyone got in here without a key. Well I guarantee the fridge didn't open up and expel its contents by itself. Thank you, I understand that. I don't know, maybe... one of us is sleepwalking or something. And violent. I don't know what to tell you Chels'. I thought it was funny when your divorcee stalker had a handsome date. Yeah, you know, she was trying to make me jealous. Hey, we left the doggy bag in the car. Ah, I'll go grab it. Tyler! What? Tyler... what the hell, is going on? I don't know. Come here. It's going to be okay. That security system is starting to look pretty good to me right now. - Ya... did you leave the door open? - No. Wait, did you pick up my jacket? - No. - Well that's weird, because I distinctly remember tossing it on the couch. And I saw you do it. You sure your aunt didn't have a few house keys floating around somewhere? No, we had the locks changed before we moved in. If you decide to install a security system, this guy will work within a price. - Alright thank you. - Okay. We're a phone call away if you need us. what you doing? I think I'm going to put some coffee on. No... uh. Stay in bed, it's Sunday for Christ sake. Can't we sleep in one day a week? No baby, I got stuff to do. - Hey. - Hey. Anything weird go on this morning? Actually, no. - Thank God. - Yeah. - Hey babe, have you seen my wallet? - No. What's wrong? Is that supposed to be some sort of a joke? Holy shit! - Did you know about this? - No, I didn't open up the refrigerator this morning. Get rid of it! Hey... where did you find my wallet? Right where you left it. Well that's weird, because I haven't been outside yet. Whatever... you get rid of the rat? Yeah I did. So look, I just got off the phone with Bobby. What do you say we head down to L.A. for the day? That shit is unreal. And the cops think that Ellen chick is behind it all? Bro, I don't really know what they think. Can we get you guys anything else? - Oh no, we're fine. - I'm good. You know, this ghostline thing reminds me of a TV show I saw once as a kid. What was it about? Well, there was this telephone pole next to a cemetery and from his grave a dead guy was able to communicate with an old lady over the phone or something like that. Pumpkin, are you suggesting they're being haunted by a ghost. Well think about it... First the phone calls, all at night, by the way. The threat, and now bizarre things happening in their house. Heather, you're letting all these ghosts on these shows go to your head. - I mean, you don't really believe-- - I... I think she's on to something. Come on, don't tell me you believe in that bullshit. Do you have a better theory, Ty? It's ridiculous. Is that right? Okay Mr. tough guy. - You two can come stay with us for a couple of nights. - I'm down with that. Not me, sorry guys. You told me yesterday you were dying to see their house. Yeah, but not with all this shit going on. Good call, girlfriend. Well I'm still coming. Actually man, it's probably best to wait it out a couple of weeks. Just until we get all this stuff sorted out, you know. By the way Heather, I am so sorry you did not get that part. Ah thanks. You know the frustrating thing is that old creep ended up casting an actress, who's only attribute was a huge rack. And I don't even think they were real. Surprise, surprise. I just think a good night's rest is going to do us well. Yeah, I think so. What the hell. Chels'... look. We need to talk. Okay. Look, whoever's doing this is just trying to scare us away. Well guess what... it's working. Tyler... I know it's hard for you to fathom but what if Heather's right? Chelsea, it's going to take a lot more than this to convince me we have a ghost living in our house, okay. Hey! I'm not done talking to you. I'm just going to lock the front door and then hit the bathroom, if that's okay with you. Okay. Come on Chelsea, I got to take a pee. What, are you going to make me go outside? Chels'. Who are you talking to? Okay look. You might think I'm crazy but what happened last night re-enforces my belief that something very evil is in our house. You mean like a demon? No... I'm thinking ghost. What are you thinking, Tyler? All I can say right now, is that my belief system is in a state of upheaval. You know, in the law enforcement profession we have to choose our words very carefully when it comes to controversial issues - such as the paranormal. - As you can imagine we're trained to approach every situation from a common sense point of view. I told you they wouldn't believe us. No, that's not what we're saying. Off the record... we believe that there's a distinct possibility that what you're experiencing is, in fact... paranormal activity. Okay. Okay, so how do we deal with that? I'm going to recommend someone for you to talk to. But first, we want to bring you up to speed on our investigation. We located the folks who had the number, that Ellen originally called. - Okay. - According to Mr. Dettweiller, the main reason they left town was to get away from the nephew. An unemployed construction worker, by the name of Eric Chambers. Apparently he'd been leaching off him for years. But here's the interesting part. Eight years ago, the police questioned Eric regarding the disappearance of his girlfriend, Ellen Pendleton. But unfortunately there was no evidence of foul play and Ellen's body was never found. We also need to point out, that since then there's been seven other unresolved cases of missing women in Lovejoy. - Was this Eric guy suspected in any of those cases? - No. Here again, no bodies, no evidence. Now, about your little problem. So then Marina and I decided to form the Lovejoy paranormal society or, L.P.S for short. But we're not restricted to Lovejoy. Scott and I investigate hauntings all over the south west. Hmm... so as ghost hunters, what's the craziest thing you guys have ever seen? Go ahead. Well I guess it would have to be the apparition of a woman we encountered at the old Linda Vista hospital in L.A a few years ago. And you saw her face and everything? It was more like a human shaped shadow. Let me tell you something. It scared the crap out of us. I think you have some new admirers. Yeah, I saw that earlier. What can I say babe, when you got it, you got it. I remember the good old days, when the cute girls used to look at me like that and smile. - And now they laugh out loud? - Yeah pretty much. Anyone like any more coffee? No thank you. Right, so... How do we do this ghost hunting thing? Well actually it's very simple. We just need access to your house for one night. Oh. Okay, yeah. Hello Ellen, I'm Scott. And this is Marina. We mean you no harm. We just want to talk with you. Why are you doing all these nasty things to Chelsea and Tyler, huh? Justin, are you getting anything on your camera? - Nada. - I don't see anything in here. I don't know... - Seems a little-- - Hey you know what, let's try the master bedroom. Marina, this is really quiet in here, I'm not finding anything. Anything on your meter? Nothing really. It's really quiet. You know what, Justin. Why don't you go ahead and cut the camera. We're going to try something else. I'm not getting a damned thing. I'm beginning to think these folks are just messing with us. - You know what, let's just do an EVP session. - Okay. What time is it? Coming up on 2:00 am. You want to pack it in? Might as well, we're just wasting our time here. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the wind. Hey Justin, grab your camera. - Let's go. - Copy that. Are you ready? Hello. Hello. Is anyone in here? Ellen? - Scott, this door didn't close by itself. - I know. Hey guys, my battery just croaked. I'm gonna go get a new one. Okay, but make it fast. Where the hell did Justin go? Er, Scott. What? Oh my God! - Let' try to make contact. - Seriously? - It's what we do, isn't it? - Yeah but-- Hi, I'm Scott, and this is Marina. Are you Ellen? We don't mean you any harm. We just want to talk. Holy shit, let's get out of here! Open the door. - Marina, open the door! - I'm trying! Marina! Look, there are ghosts, and there are poltergeists. Which you traditionally describe as malicious ghosts. In my opinion... what you have is a poltergeist. And a very pissed off one at that. Did you guys catch her on tape? - Unfortunately no. - What does she want from us? We have no idea. How do we get rid of her? Listen, I can't vouch for this guy's credibility. But he claims he can rid any house of any malicious spirit. Mort Castleberry? I would call him if I were you. Listen, we got to go. Aren't you guys going to come back, and pick up your stuff? Yeah, but do us a favor Put it all in your driveway, because we're never setting foot in that house again. So this is Ellen, huh? - Yup. - She's very pretty. So what are your plans? Chelsea wants to leave. Well, I can certainly understand why. - Thank you. - And I assume you want to stay. Look, the way things are going with our acting careers right now, this may be the only opportunity we have to own property again. Not if we sell it, and use the money to buy something else. Nothing's selling in this town, Chels'. Plus even if we were lucky enough to find a buyer, we'd never get what it's worth. Tyler's right. This is one of the most depressed real estate markets in the state. So in other words, we're stuck in this goddamn place? You know what, just take the car and go back to L.A. I'm sure that Bobby and Heather will let you crash with them for a few days. Are you serious? Look, maybe if I'm in the house by myself Ellen will reveal herself to me and I can finally prove I'm not the guy she's after. No... if you're staying, so am I. - Chels', we have no idea what kind of-- - Excuse me. Can I make a suggestion. We really appreciate this detective. Well like I was saying, I've got no family or social life to speak of, so it's really not a problem. And look, we're going to be roomies for the next few days. - Feel free to call me Nick. - Alright, cool Nick, thanks. Now look, there's somewhere I need to be. But you just got here. I know, but I'll be back before dark... don't worry. Is there somewhere I can put this bag? Oh, I can take it, yeah. Is that why you're here, to talk about Ellen Pendleton? That's right. Well nothing's changed, I still have no idea where she went. You two were pretty close, right? Yeah, you could say that. Then we have good news for you. - How so? - We believe she's back in town. Really... how do you know that? For starters, she called your old phone number. Which was given to someone else, and she asked for you? Huh? And there are two people who claim to have actually seen her. Is that so? Sure wasn't someone who just looks like her. No... they made a positive I.D. Mr. Chambers, I'm confused. I'd have thought you'd be thrilled to know that she's alive and back in town. Of course I am... why wouldn't I be? We're going to let you know that because of this new information we've officially closed our case. Whatever. Have a nice day Mr. Chambers. Yeah. One more thing. The people who saw her. They said she seemed very angry. Do you have any idea why? No. Chelsea, the sauce is delicious. It's my Sicilian grandmother's special recipe. Well I haven't had a home cooked meal in a long time, let alone one as tasty as this. Considering what you're doing for us... it's the least I could do. Well, as a bachelor who survives on take out and fast food. I sincerely appreciate it. So how did Eric react, when you told him Ellen was back in town? In a word, surprised. Where did you find him? He was in this dive bar down in Pine. - Turns out the son of a bitch is a regular there. - Hmm. You didn't mention anything about Ellen being a ghost, did you? No of course not, I didn't want to spook him. Pun intended. - Um, more wine Nick? - Yes please. - Hit me. - I'll hit you. Okay, Are you ready yet? Nick? What? Yuk. Chels', what are you doing? - Tyler what is it? - It was her. - What happened? - Ellen, she was just on top of me. - Where did she go? - I don't know. You guys turned on the light and she left. I'll check out the house. Come here. Come and sit. - Honey I'm so sorry. - Where were you? - I was turning off the TV. - The TV, why was that on? I don't know. Maybe Nick forgot to turn it off earlier. Oh god. - You okay? - Yeah. You sure it wasn't a dream? Yeah, I was definitely awake. You think it was Ellen. Yeah I mean, her face was all... Shit, I can't even describe how terrifying it was, but it didn't look anything like the picture. Well, I'll stay up tonight in case she comes back. We appreciate that. Nick... what's up? What the fuck was that? What just happened? What am I doing in here? - Why the hell are you on top of me? - You tell me. Is everyone alright? We wouldn't have been, if Tyler hadn't woken up when he did. I'm so sorry... look. Under the circumstances, I think it's best if I go home. That's okay Nick, It's not your fault I think you were possessed by Ellen's ghost. Wow, have you come a long way. A few days ago, you refused to even acknowledge the existence of ghosts, and now you're suggesting spirit possession? Look, coming face to face with something as terrifying as Ellen's apparition is enough to change anyone's perspective on the spirit world. Plus the whole possession thing makes a whole lot more sense than Nick simply waking up in the middle of the night, and trying to shoot me. Actually the concept of spiritual possession exists in many religions... including Christianity and Buddhism. I studied religion in college. Look, it's obvious that up to this point Ellen has just been screwing around with you but I think in light of tonight's event... it's perfectly clear that she wants you dead. We can't allow that to happen. I agree and that's why I think you should get out while you still can. Sure we can leave. Get lucky and sell the house but what if Ellen were to stick around, and terrorize the new owners I mean, what if they had kids? - I see your point but-- - He's right. Whether it's our fault or not... we're still responsible for Ellen being in this house. And now it's up to us to get rid of her. That's very admirable... but how do you propose to accomplish that? Have you ever heard of a ghost eradicator, named Mort Castleberry Cleansing tools such as Sage, incense sticks and holy water are effective in reducing negativity and removing minor ghosts. But eradicating a troublesome spirit, such as the one you describe... will require much, much more than that. So how does you whole detox program work? I can't give away any trade secrets, you understand. What I can tell you, is it conforms to the six basic principles of spiritual practice. Which has its origins in, my research science foundation. Which is dedicated to bridging the known and the unknown worlds. How long will this take? Another common question. That depends... it could take all night. And you're sure you don't want us to stick around. No, no that's not necessary... I prefer to work alone. - Okay then. - Okay. I guess we're out of here. Ah, will a check be okay? Certainly. I know where you live. I should be done here in about an hour. ...yeah, no they're nice kids, they're just, you know, gullible like most people who believe in this crap. Yeah. Well, I'll be there when I get there. Okay... alright. Bye. Don't these people ever eat? Smooth. Ellen. You and I need to have a little chat. Something creepy about this house. Case in point. Probably a... open window. I'm getting too old for this shit. Sweet mother Jesus! Come on! What the hell do you want? Please... please leave me alone. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please, please let me go. Hey please, have some mercy. If you let me go, I'll never bother you again I swear. Guess I showed that stupid bitch who's boss. Oh crap. [bones crunch The coroner confirmed that the cause of death was a broken neck. Oh my God. How did this happen? I think we all know the answer to that question. Look, what we have here is a very sticky situation. We know for a fact that you two were elsewhere when he died... but, there's no way we're ever going to convince our captain. And the D.A, that our perp' is a ghost. Then how will you explain it? The only logical explanation, is that. He was killed by an intruder. Okay. - Ty' - Hm. What is it? I was just thinking that if we could get Eric to come here... then we could finally convince Ellen that I'm not him, and she would leave us alone. Mr. Jantzen. Listen to me. Eric Chambers is bad news. You don't want him anywhere near you, or your lady. Trust me on that. A much better plan, would be for the two of you to move out of this house and leave town, immediately. - We'll consider it. - In the meantime. This house is a crime scene. Until we complete our investigation... you'll need to stay elsewhere. She snapped his neck? - Like a twig. - Holy crap. Please tell me, you're not going back there. Are you two nuts? Ty' has a plan. To do what, get yourselves killed? Look, all we need to do, is lure that asshole back to the house. Tyler believes that seeing Eric will make Ellen realize, that she's haunting the wrong guy. Okay, let's say this works. In light of what happened to Mort.. how do you stop her from killing Eric? Good question babe. The way I see it... that's his problem. - Hold it. - Oh come on girl, you used to run circles round me. Give me a break, will ya. With all the crap we've had going on lately jogging's been the last thing on our minds. Yeah well, truth be told, I could use a breather myself. Oh... it's a text from Tyler. Uh, he says the audition was a huge waste of time and he's much rather be jogging with us instead. Bummer, is he at the apartment? No, he's at Costco. Says he'll meet us at us at Jerry's Delhi at one. Sweet. He also says, "don't forget to shower" "but not together". Ain't gonna touch that one. What time do you think Heather will be done with her shoot? Hard to say, could be kind of late. What time are you and Tyler heading out tomorrow? I'd say no later than noon. Ah, I wish you could stay longer. Me too and listen, we really appreciate you letting us stay at your place. - Hey you'd do the same thing for us. - Hmm. I just wish you didn't have to go back to that damn house. Last one to the bench buys lunch. Hey! Cheater. You do understand why we have to go back there, right? Yeah, but it doesn't mean I have to like it. Believe me, I'm not a hundred percent sold on Tyler's plan either. But right now, it looks like our best option. Bobby. A man died in our house. I know, but are you absolutely sure it was Ellen, I mean who's to say it wasn't an intruder. It was her. Look, we just don't want to lose you too. Not going to happen. Okay, if you're bound and determined to go through with it, then please reconsider my offer. Bobby, you know how I feel about guns. - Besides neither of us-- - Girl, why are you being so stubborn? I'm not, it's just... I... Then do it for me. And Heather. Okay... I'll talk to Tyler again tonight. Thank you. I just, can't wait for all of this to be over so we can go back to focusing on our acting careers. Look, I hear you. - We should get back. - Yup. Hey... you want to race? No way, I want to quit while I'm ahead. - Chicken. - Mm hmm. I have to admit, I'm a little bit surprised to see you two back here. Well it's our home detective, and we've got every right to fight for it. Why do I have this knawing feeling in my gut, that you two are up to something. I don't know Nick, maybe it's something you ate. Yeah, you really should lay off that fast food, buddy. I hope you guys aren't planning on doing something stupid, like.. perhaps making contact with Eric Chambers. - No... - Don't know what you're talking about... Like you said, he's a really bad dude, so... By the way, even though he signed off on the intruder theory the D.A might still want to talk to you, at some point so, keep us apprised of your whereabouts. Alright, will do. You're sure you want to go through with this? I don't think we have a choice. Hey Betty, give me another. I don't think so, slick. You're tab's already out of control. Come on doll, you know I'm good for it. When's the last time you worked? A while ago, but look I've got a big job coming up next week. I'll pay you on Friday. The entire tab? Every cent. Okay... but if you let me down. I'll 86 your ass faster than a hooker at a truck stop. Alright, no need for drama. - Thanks sugar. - Uh huh. - What'll it be hun? - Glass of wine. - House will do. - White or red? - White please. - You got it. May I help you? Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare. Not used to seeing a woman like you, in a place like this. Woman like me? What I meant to say was, a classy and attractive woman like you. Ah... bet you say that to anyone with tits. Honey... watch out for this one. I haven't seen you around before, are you new in town? I've been here a while, I just don't get out much. So what brings you out tonight? Well if you must know, I just booted my no good boyfriend out of the house and I'm in the mood to celebrate. Are you now... I'm Eric. Dianna. I got to tell you Eric, I haven't laughed like this in a long time. You're a real fun guy. In more ways than you know, baby. But it's getting kinda late, I should go home. Come one now, I thought you wanted to celebrate. I do but... uh look. I've already had one D.U.I I can't risk getting another. I hear you doll. And I've got the perfect solution to that problem. Which is? Got any booze at your place? Whoa cowboy. I barely know you. Hey... we'll have a few drinks, a few laughs. And I'll go home. Wasn't someone murdered on this street last week? Yeah, it was only four houses down. Tragic event. Uh, so make yourself at home. I'm going to get into something more comfortable. You got it, doll. Don't tell me, the no good boyfriend? Guess again asshole. Alright man, just stay cool. I will if you will. What the hell is this, some kind of a shakedown? - We just want to talk. - About what? About what you did to Ellen. Ellen Pendleton, I didn't do nothing to her. Yeah you sure did. You killed that poor girl, and then disposed of her body. Hold on now, the cops just told me she's back in town. - So I couldn't have killed her. - Oh she's back alright. Just not how you think. Ellen, you want to come out here, and meet the real Eric? Ellen, here's your chance to get even with the guy who murdered you. You guys are bat shit crazy. - Tyler! - Let her go. Put it down man, or I'll cut her, I'm serious I'll do it! - Tyler. - Okay. Now back away. - Please. - I take it back. You aren't crazy. You're just stupid. Guess I could make it look like a home invasion. - Yeah... - that would work. Now I just have to decide whether to shoot ya, or cut your throats. Look we're not going to say anything to anyone. I'm going to make damn sure of that. What a shame. I was looking forward to having some fun with you. Maybe I still can. - I'd rather be dead. - Look. If you're just going to kill us, why not tell us what happened to Ellen. Sure, why not. - Dead people can't talk, right? - Yeah. You'd be surprised. Well... it so happens that Ellen was my first kill. There were others? Oh yeah... seven. To be exact. But you know what? The first one. Was by far the sweetest. Get your filthy hands off of her. The stupid bitch tried to dump me. Like I was going to let that happen. Come on man, let's just talk about this, okay? She begged me not to kill her. But the more she begged, - the more I wanted to choke the life out of her-- - Eric stop! I'll give you anything you want, I'll give you this goddam house, just stop! But, since I got to make this look like a home invasion, it just makes more sense to shoot ya. These eight... women you killed. How did you dispose of their bodies? Buried them down the road from my uncles house. Ellen got the nicest spot though. Right under an old scrub oak tree. Now that I got that off my chest, it's time for you two to die. Eric. Is there someone else here? Maybe, why don't you go take a look. I believe I will. Don't go nowhere. Come out, come out, where ever you are. Hurry up. I know you're here somewhere. I'm gonna find you sooner or later. So you might as well show yourself. Hello. Eric. Really starting to piss me off! I don't know what kind of goddam game you're playing, but I've had enough of it. Eric. Shit! Ellen? Gunshots. You're supposed to be dead goddam it. Oh no. Tyler, Tyler. Ellen please don't. He had nothing to do with your death. Please. Be at peace. Thanks to the information you were able to extract from Eric. We already found five of the eight bodies, including Ellen's. It's only a matter of time before we find the other three. - Well at least in will bring closure to their families. - Indeed. Okay, well we'll let you folks get back to what you were doing. - Alright, hey thanks for everything detective. - You folks take care. Notice how pleasant it's been round here the past few nights. It's been pretty nice not having to sleep with one eye open. Another unknow caller. Should I answer it? Yeah there's no sense in being paranoid, go ahead put it on speaker. Hello. Hello Dianna. Dianna, I'm not... Who is this? You don't recognize my voice? It's me... Eric. - Eric Chambers? - Yes. We have some unfinished business, Dianna. See you soon. ♪ I'm coming for you ♪
