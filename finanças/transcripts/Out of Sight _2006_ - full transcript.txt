Avigail Harari Hadas Yaron A Daniel Syrkin film Talia Volach Rest in Peace Yaara. Yaara. Dafna look who's here. Hi. Tirza, Ephraim, you remember Yaara? Talya's cousin. She's getting her Ph. D in mathematics. At Princeton. This must be a terrible blow for you. You were like sisters. She took you everywhere... That's her phone. How do you turn it off? - Wait! Maybe it's someone who doesn't know yet. Hello. No, this is her mother. No, she passed away. Excuse me, is this the men's or women's room? The men's. Can you help me find the women's locker room? Yeah, sure. Careful, there's a step. There you go. It's there in front of you. - Thanks a lot. Excuse me, can you help me with something else? Of course. Can you tell me which looks better on me? This one or that one? This one is more comfortable but I think I look better in the other one. What do you say? Say, are you here with somebody? With Mom or Dad? No. - Are you really blind? Try me. Pretend you're going to hit me, you'll see that I don't flinch. Go on. Lousy kids. He was so scared. he was so nervous. He almost hit me. "Out of Sight" I am out of the office for two days and they publish my article with five errors. I counted them, Uri. Relax, they're only in the bibliography. Here, Yaara brought you something to eat. There were so many people here today. Too many. Doctoral candidates, students. They all wanted to see the distraught family. Eat something before you faint. Lettuce, green. You remember? - Lettuce, green. Yes, lettuce green. Can you let me in on this conversation too? Talia, she tried to teach me the color green. She made Hanna buy all the different kinds of lettuce and all the different kinds of green vegetables. We made a huge pile on the kitchen table. We tasted each one and she named each one a different shade of green. And for desert she sent me out to pick some grass. Can you turn the pages for me? - You want to play now? So late? You can practice tomorrow morning. But I'm supposed to practice everyday. Tomorrow morning, sweetheart. All right. Okay, I think we should go. Goodnight, See you later, Rafa. you aren't taking Yaara, are you? Why don't you stay with us? Yeah, of course. Lift up your shirt. Are you sure you want to stay here? -Yes. Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. Tell her to stop! Right now! I can't stand it! Can you see? - No. Talia, are you sure? - Yes. I trust you. Should I stop? - Don't you dare! I feel the wind coming from down there. 75, 76, 77, 78, 79 This is it! Was I right? Talia... Talia, is this the edge? Of course it is... I told you, you can see anything you want to see. Shit! Dafna, why are you standing there? Go get her slippers. Don't move. I'll clean up here. They're next to the suitcase. Hanna, I'm sorry. So clumsy of me... It's okay, forget it. Are you all right? - Yes. Your slippers are in front of you. Dafna, what's wrong with you? What she saw in that room, will stay with her for the rest of her life. You know it was an accident. - What was? If Dafna's piano lesson hadn't been canceled, I would have found Talia. It was me she wanted to punish. Enough, Hanna. Why would she want to punish you? Who knows what was going through her head. What happened to her? What did she say to you? I thought everything was okay. If I thought something was wrong, I wouldn't have let this happen. What about you? Do you have someone at Princeton? A love story? No, I don't have time for that nonsense. Nonsense? What am I going to do with you? One day it will happen. She could have studied anything she wanted. The sky was the limit. She chose psychology. I told her that it isn't really an exact science... Where did she find a pistol? How could it have happened? I have no idea. She didn't leave a letter. The last time I got a haircut it came out really bad. each side came out a different length. Her poor parents. How could we have known what was happening with her. How nice of you to come. - How are you? Yaara is here. - She's here already? I want to introduce you to her. Yaara. Gidi is here. Gidi, this is our Yaara. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I heard a lot about you. - Me too. I'll leave you two alone? Want to sit down? - Yes. So, you two grew up in this house Yes, when my mother died, my father sort of got lost. Hanna and Rafael pretty much adopted me. Talia did also. - The truth is... So you're the boyfriend from Intel? - I guess. Look, there are really beautiful photos of the two girls. Who's that? Let it go... What are all these pictures with the pink dresses? Is it her birthday party? Are those the chiffon dresses? - Uh huh. That was our Bat Mitzvah. We drove our parents crazy so that we could have our parties together. How did you learn to play the piano? By ear. Oh, right... She told me that you went to the movies a lot. Yeah, we would go to matinees. She would whisper explanations to me. Even though I understood most of it myself. Weren't you afraid that she'd change the endings? Why would she do a thing like that? Of course not. What's this blood? Did you get hurt? Yeah. I fell down the stairs. Your dress got dirty. No it didn't. - Ah, there's a stain. No way. Dad. - What? Dad, do you remember at our Bat Mitzvah, when I fell down the stairs? Yes. Do you remember if my dress got dirty? How could I remember a thing like that? Can you see if my dress got dirty or not. A little, but mainly I see two beautiful girls. Talia! -It's me, Yaara, it's Dad. Where are you going? - To show Talia my dress. You can't go in there right now. - Why not? Because she's getting dressed. - but I can go in anytime No... Yaara! What happened? Does it hurt a lot? Where did you get hurt? - My knee. Is there blood? - No. Its fine. Wonderful. Congratulations! Excuse me, a second. Hello. Hello, Talia? This is Haya from Dr. Dahan's clinic. Talia? - Yes. Excuse me? -Am I speaking to Talia Volach? -Yes. You had an appointment on Tuesday, but you never showed up. And you didn't notify us. - Ah, I'm sorry. If it's still relevant, there's an opening tomorrow at 9:00 am. Okay, I'll be there. It's on Ben Gurion St. right? Exactly. Number 27. Okay, thanks. Who was it? Someone who didn't know. Yeah, it's blood. How did it feel when it came out? - Pretty strange. It's not like pee. You really feel it when it comes out. How does it look, red? - Of course it's red, it's blood. It smells red. Maybe I should taste it? - What? It came out of there. You're not going to put it in your mouth. Just a drop. It tastes red. Should I try too? You're right, it does taste red. You can tell... you know, that you're a woman now. Really. How come you got your period first? It's not fair, I'm two weeks older than you. If I got it, so will you. It's in our genes. Do you promise to taste mine too? - Promise. Talia Volach. - That's me. Sit down here. The doctor will see you soon. Thanks. Hello, Talia. I see you've decided to come after all. I'm not Talia. I'm Yaara. I'm her cousin. - Hello, Yaara. How can I help you? I wanted to know what Talia's appointment was about. I can't tell you that. There is something called doctor-patient confidentiality. Was it for an abortion? That's something between me and Talia. If she wants to, she'll tell you herself. Talia passed away. When? - A few days ago. What did she die of exactly? - She committed suicide. So, you're not saying it wasn't. - Excuse me? An abortion. you're not saying it wasn't Thank you. How far along did you say she was? - I didn't. She was in her eighth week. You look familiar, weren't you here before? Yes, I was here. Seven years ago. When she had her first abortion. You have my condolences. Hello. Hi. - Hi. Yaara, why don't you begin Did you know that Talia was pregnant? What? - So you didn't know. No! How do you know? - I went to see her doctor. She had an appointment for an abortion. She had an abortion? - No, She didn't have a chance. It was two days ago. What month was she in? - Eighth week. Second month. Try to remember, maybe she said something to you? No. I would've known. Maybe she said something to you? Why don't you try to remember. Maybe she didn't want you to know she was pregnant? Maybe she didn't tell him. We just want to know what was going on with her. If you know something, tell us. Listen... The truth is that for the last few months our relationship hasn't been... Since we came back from the trip things weren't working out. What do you mean? Two weeks ago we decided to break up. Did you know that? - Me? Of course not. What do you mean, we decided? Who decided? Talia. - Why didn't you say something? I'm sorry, I didn't know how to tell you. But if she was pregnant, you could have at least taken responsibility! That imbecile! You think you know everything, huh? I'm not the one responsible. What are you doing? Wow, you frightened me. Is it homework? - Oh, yeah. You're writing a diary! I wanted to tell you. I swear! Don't you believe me? I'm sorry, okay? You're right. You're right. I'm a bad person. I'm disgusting. You shouldn't be my friend. You should hate me and never talk to me again. What are you talking about? You're my best friend. A diary is a private thing, you don't have to show me. Talia, you don't have to tell me anything. Really, it's a personal matter. Do you want me to read what I wrote? You don't have to. I want you to hear. "Today Yaara and I were the last ones at the pool. The lifeguard said that we could stay until he closed up. And Yaara asked me about Ehud. I have been wanting to tell her for a long time, how great it was. How gentle and sweet he was at our first time, on the trip to Ein Gedi. But I didn't want to tell her because I know how much she is waiting for someone to love her the way Ehud loves me. I just know she'll find someone. Are you crying? Why? Talia, But how will I know who it is? Because I'll tell you. I'll always take care of you. Don't you know that? Always. The room is locked, Yaara. I just wanted to go in for a second. We didn't want people going in there. Yes, but you know that it was my room too. I know. I don't want anyone to go in there. Okay. Come. You know we had a dispatcher at the station who was blind. That guy knew all the taxis and all our clients by heart. Every record was written in his head. He was really something. He had a girl friend, who wasn't blind, but they got along, without any problems. Tell me, what about you? Do you have a boy friend? No, I don't. What, a pretty girl like you? You must have had someone. I did. Were they blind or normal? One was deaf, the other was a dwarf. Is that considered normal? Yaara! - Ehud. It's so sad about Talia. I was really sorry to hear about it. Come here, I want you to meet someone. This is Maya. Maya, Yaara. When did this happen? How old is she? She'll be five months old soon. She's beautiful. So, how's the family? Her father's sick, isn't he? Diabetes? Yes, they're still in shock. You know she told me about the abortion. What abortion? Talia had an abortion? Yes, when she was 15. Did you forget? -No. I didn't know. She never told you? She said she did. Do you think it was mine? It wasn't mine, for sure. She didn't lie, if that's what you're insinuating She didn't lie... I don't know. She told stories. There is no way it was mine. Maybe you don't remember? You had lots of girlfriends. Things like that you don't forget. There is no way it was mine because I didn't have sex with her. You don't think I'd believe that? She told me that you were the first. -The first? She didn't want sex, not with me, anyway. She played all sorts of games with me. Until finally I got fed up. Actually there was a time that I wanted you. But I couldn't get near you without going through her first. Hanna? Dafna. I told her not to come in here. Why did she have to see this? Why did she have to see this horror? Go to bed. I'll come and say good night, okay? I'm sorry, Rafa. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Yaara, I know that you miss her. We all miss her very much. But if you want to help, you have to think about Hanna and Dafna. They're very vulnerable. - You're right. I'm sorry. All right, come on. Dad. Dad. Good evening, my dear radio listeners. Welcome back to our show. "the Talara and Yaala show" on 69 FM, Radio Rehovot. And today we have a girl on the line. Oops! Sorry it's a boy. Ooh la, la. His name is Tomer, the lifeguard. Tomer you are on the air. Hello girls. My name is Tomer and I have a problem. I'm crazy about a girl who doesn't know I exist. Her name is Yaara and she is the hottest chick in Rehovot. What do I have to do to win her heart? You dope! He doesn't know I exist. He does too. - You said he was hot. and that all the girls want him. So what? -So why would he even look at me, Talia? And besides with me being... - Stop it Yaara. What has that got to do with it? You're prettier and smarter than any girl I know. And you don't need favors from anyone. And so, you will go up to him tomorrow at the pool and make the first move. I don't know. - What do you mean, "I don't know"? Nothing ever scares us! Nothing what so ever! Stop it, I have to pee. Go for me too. And turn out the light. Oh, sorry. Dad, don't do that. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. It's so annoying. I didn't hear you come in. Everything all right? - Yeah. It's nothing. - Did something happen? I went into Talia's room. I messed up. They didn't want people going in. So what? It was my room too. I have a right to go in even if they said not to. Period. What are you listening to? - Nothing. Music. What's that notebook? Do you want me to read it to you? No. - Okay. The truth is, I'm really tired, Dad. I want to go to sleep. Good night, Yaara. - Good night. I'm glad you came. Good night. Good night. That Tomer can't take his eyes off you. -Stop it. Go over to him. This is your chance. What should I do with him? Now? Are you just going to talk about it? Don't you want to do it? - I want to, but what if he doesn't. He wants to and he's experienced. It's better that your first time be with him. Don't miss this chance, go. You don't want to wait to do it with some creep, do you? Just ask him to take you into one of the stalls then pull him in. He'll get it. How do I look? - Beautiful. It'll be great, don't worry. Go on, go already. I'll wait right here. Tomer. Tomer. This is the men's room.. There's no one here, anyway. Can you take me to the toilet? Where's that sweet cousin of yours? Why doesn't she help you? She does help me. So, what did you say your name was? -Yaara. Yaara, right. Pretty name. Here you go. Wait a second. Come in with me. - What? I'm afraid to be in here alone. No problem. Hi, Gidi. What if it wasn't me? I can smell the incense. Can I come in? I'm sorry about what happened at Hanna and Rafael's. I didn't mean to blame it on you like that. Oh you didn't? Don't be mad at me. I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at myself that I got myself into all this. Why did you two break up? Ever since we came back from India, she didn't want to have sex with me. I said, okay. We can work it out, we'll get over it. We'll light some more incense. You know, she wrote me saying that everything was good between you two. So she wrote. I loved her but she played games with me. What's that? Her diary. Can you read it to me? Why me? I don't want anyone from the family to read it. "Whoever reads this is a peeping tom with a dirty mind and if he turns this page, he is also a filthy stinking maniac that I hope stinks his whole life. " Are you sure I should read this? Will I stink my whole life if I do? Look for... Look for May '95. We went on a trip to Ein Gedi. Yes, it's here. "Why did I go on this fucking trip? These trips make me so sick.. At night Ehud tried to crawl into my sleeping bag but I pretended to be asleep. I kept saying to myself get out of here, asshole. You make me sick with your filthy hands. Finally he gave up but I couldn't fall asleep all night. " Is that it? - Yes. Look for... Look for the Summer vacation. July. Yeah, July eighth. Today at the pool, that revolting Tomer., wouldn't stop staring at us. I sent Yaara to him. Poor thing. He thought he was getting me but instead got the blind cousin. " Go on. "Not that he cared, on the contrary. Another experience to tell the guys about. I followed them into the stall next to theirs. I heard him and poor Yaara. She started to cry. She asked him to let her go but he thought she was just teasing. It just made him cockier. " Keep reading. "I stayed there and didn't do anything. I just kept thinking she should feel what it's like. She wanted love. There it is, Yaara. That's love. Sooner or later she'll have to learn, better it be from me. Oh I am a monster. God, why did you make me such a terrible person. " Stop, I don't want to. Give me the diary. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have read you the... Give it to me! I don't want to. Stop. What are you crazy? How can I stop now? Stop it. Stop it. Talia! Talia! Talia. - How was it? What's the matter? Wasn't it good? Yaara? - It was okay. Great. Tomer said we could stay until he closed up. She has to understand how cool she is. So much smarter and stronger than other girls I've been meaning to tell her how great it is with him. How gentle and sweet he was... No. Nothing happened. Talia, is this the edge? - I told you, you could see anything you want! Dad! - Yaara. I'm here. I want to show you something A rare butterfly, the Morpho Menelaus. It's almost extinct. Hold it in your hand. Take the box. Carefully, with your finger, touch the butterfly. But be careful. Its wings are covered with little scale-like things. They actually break up the light rays. It looks colorful but it's only an illusion. Beautiful. What did you do? Watch out. One minute, Wait. Hold on, hold on. It's nothing, only a scratch. Hold it down tight with your finger. What for? -Enough. Why did she do it, Dad? Why? What did I ever do to her? - It's all right. I hate her! - Okay. I hate her, Dad. I swear. I want to kill her. I hate her. Fucking Bitch! I want to go back to Princeton. You will. - No, I want to go back to Princeton today, tomorrow, I don't care. You can't go back tomorrow because tomorrow we're going to the grave site - I don't care. Will you change my ticket? Stop it, I have to pee. Go for me too. And turn out the light. Are you sleeping, sweetie? - Yes. I missed you terribly... I just wanted to say good night. Enough, Yaara is in the bathroom. Shh! Sweetheart. Don't be afraid. You know I love you most of all. Shh! Sweetheart. Don't be afraid. You know I love you the most. Talia? - Yes. Is something wrong? - No. Are you sure? - Yes, go to sleep. Talia, come here! Talia! Talia! Talia! Talia! Talia, come here! Talia. Talia, where are you! Talia, you retard! Where were you? I thought you drowned. If I drowned, would you be sorry? How could you say that? - Would you? I couldn't live without you. My stomach hurts. I can't move. Drink some water, you'll feel better. It's very important that you come. I'm not coming. I won't see anything, anyway. I'll stay with Dafna, so she won't be alone. Okay. Come. Don't worry, we'll be all right. That's not how you play it. I know but I haven't played it in a long time. You need four hands for that. I know, but I only have two. So, why didn't you go? - No reason. I didn't feel like it. Why didn't you go? - I didn't feel like it. Are you angry with her? No. I don't know. I'm so mad at her. I miss her. You know, I don't think she meant to hurt us. I think there was a secret that she kept to herself. Did she say anything to you? - When did she ever talk to me? Tell me, did she have a fight with anyone lately? Maybe with Mom? Or Dad? I need to... Excuse me... One minute, Dafna. Eat something, Rafa. You haven't eaten anything. I think I'll go for a swim. It will be good for me. You should. You haven't gone all week. I'll just go up to see what's with Dafna... One minute, Rafa. She just went to bed. It would be a pity to wake her. She's not asleep, I heard her moving about. I asked you not to go up there! - Yaara! Dad, I asked him not to go upstairs. Why does he have to go up there? She's sleeping now. What's the matter with you? Enough! I know why Talia committed suicide. Why did she commit suicide? Because of him. Because of Rafael. What are you talking about? He slept with her. What? I think he started with Dafna too. Tell me, who put that rubbish in your head? Do you even hear what you're saying? He would come into her room. - When? At night, when I slept over. He would wait till I left and then he would come to her. He could have done it while I was there, too. What is all this crap? I also came into your room. He got her pregnant when she was 16! Enough, I don't want to hear about it! Enough. - You don't want to hear. But it happened. It happened right in front of your eyes. In front of your eyes and Hanna's. So how is it that all these years you didn't see anything? Because I'm blind! Where are you going? Yaara, get in the car. Yaara. Yaara. - Go away. Yaara, stop this nonsense and get in the car. Go. Get out of here! Yaara, I'm sorry. Get in the car. Get out of here. Don't follow me. Yaara, where are you going? You'll fall. Yaara! Yaara! What are you doing here? I'm sorry about what happened. Never mind. We've all been a little tense lately. I don't know what happened to me. Say, is there anyone else here? - No. Okay. I'm coming in. It's cold, isn't it? - Yes. I'll warm up in a second. Do you remember when Talia and I were little and you taught us how to swim. Somebody had to teach you, right? First you taught us how to float. And then you held us. And then you would let us go. Do you remember? And then you let go. - Yeah. And then, how was it? How did you hold us, like this? You put your hands here, right? - Yes, that's how it was. But, how did you touch her? - What? How, where did you touch Talia? Was it here or was it lower down? Huh? - You're crazy. How did you touch Talia? I want you to show me, it's okay. What are you talking about? I'm talking about how you touched her. Did you enjoy fucking her? Did you enjoy fucking her? Did you enjoy fucking her? Did you enjoy fucking her? Daddy! What do you want? Leave us alone, already. Yaara. What happened? Are you all right? You're soaking wet. Wait a minute, I'll get you something dry. Stay with me. Stay with me. Sorry. Come inside. I'll get you something dry to wear. I thought you would want to get rid of her things. I tried. But I couldn't. You know you're the one I love the most. We'll take care of one another. We won't let anyone do anything bad to us, right? Good night, sweetheart. - Good night, Daddy. Where were you? I was at Gidi's. I don't understand. Couldn't you call? I sat here all night going crazy from worrying. I called everyone we know - Sorry. Yaara, about what happened yesterday... I'm sorry about what I said. I don't know. I don't know what happened to me. Okay, so we'd better start getting ready so we're not late for the flight. I brought your suitcase, from Rafa's house. Will you manage by yourself? - Yes. Dad. What's this? "Mom and Dafna, forgive me for what I am about to do. I want to believe that you didn't know, Mom. Even though I asked myself a 1000 times if that's possible. But if you haven't guessed you should know that Dad has been raping me, since I was 12. In my room, in our house. " Dad. Talia... Dad? Yaara! It's the letter. "You should know that in spite of his diabetes, he is not weak He is a strong and terrible man. " What happened? "A monster. " Is everything all right? Did something happen? Read it to me. "When I came back from India I tried to save her. To save Dafna. I begged him to take me instead of her. But he took us both. Mom, don't hate me. My dear Dafna, I want you to have a normal life. Dad says that he loves you most of all. But he doesn't. He said that to me too and now I'm dead. Talia. " Did he ever do anything to you? - What? Tell me the truth. Did he touch you? - No. No, Dad, no. He didn't touch me. I didn't want to see. - Enough, Dad. Yaara. I thought you were on the plane already. Where is everybody? Dafna is at school, Rafa is upstairs sleeping. Is something wrong? I need you to see something. Where did you find this? Read it, Hanna. Who read this to you, Yaara? - Dad. Anyone else read it? - No, only Dad and I. And Dafna, I guess. I don't feel well. I... I want a glass of water. Hanna! Hanna. What are you doing? Hanna, what are you doing? - Yaara, you'll burn yourself. Yaara it's ours. It's mine. It's from my daughter. - Yaara. It was meant for us. Us alone! Hanna. Enough! Enough. Enough. Take her away from here and go now, Uri. Dafna is not coming back here. We'll pick her up from school and she'll come to our house. If you don't go to the police, we will. Come, Yaara. What did they want? -To say goodbye before Yaara flies back. I told them that you were asleep. I loved her so much. She loved me, didn't she? - Of course. It's impossible not to love you, Rafa. Let me stay here for a second. Hi, Gidi. Do you want to be alone? I can wait for you in the parking lot. No, I want you to stay. How do the flowers look? Are they beautiful? Very. "Talia Volach Rafael Volach" You're not going to jump or anything? -No. Are you sure you trust me? Um, no. Ready? Ready? 75, 76, 77... 78, 79. That's it. Am I there? Tell me, I have to know. - Are you sure? Yes. I guess so. She lied to me. One more step and we're in the sea. If you don't believe me, take a step. I'll hold you. I believe you. I love her, you know.
