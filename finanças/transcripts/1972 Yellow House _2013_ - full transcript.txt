And I saw the little girl and followed her. I feel like a creep, but I followed her to the pool because she asked me to go swimming with her, 'cause I thought she was real. Did you know it was full of dirt? I didn't know there was a pool. I was saying, "There's no pool." So you crawl out of the bathtub and followed her thinking, "Okay, it's somebody's kid.

The footage has been released to the media by Summerland police who hope that someone out there can help solve this mystery. Investigators confirm the film was shot by the missing couple. Believed they were murdered by occult members. We know they moved to Summerland in 1972 to start a new life after their only child died of a miscarriage. Ashley picked Summerland off a map to start their lives over again. Now Summerland was founded in 1883 by real estate speculator H.L. Williams. He divided the land into parcels and then promoted the tiny lots to fellow spiritualists. The houses they built included bizarre features such as doors that open to walls and stairways ascending to no where. And the spiritual center of the town was a community séance room which is now the site of the big yellow house. They believe Summerland had a special gateway to contact the dead.
