Oh, Alice. Why? Damn you. You got my sister pregnant. What the hell's going on here? Get off! Here. What's the matter with you boys anyway? That's enough. - Now, where are you going? - Where's my vest? Your mother asked you where you're going. -Out. -Don't you think you've caused enough trouble for one day. Look, I'll be back in a little while, all right? What do you want? Um, where's Alice? I have to see her. That's impossible. What do you mean impossible? I don't want her near you. Now, why don't you go away and leave us both alone. Listen, Mrs. Courtney. I love Alice. I want to marry her. You must be out of your mind. I'm sending Alice away from you. Now, wait, you can't do that. Don't you dare tell me what I can do. Now you get off this property and get off right now! You hear me? If I catch you around here again, I'll have you arrested for statutory rape. Good afternoon. Welcome. Good afternoon. And who do we have here? This is my sister, uh, Alice Courtney. Nice to have you with us. Come with me. Will you do me a favor? Yeah. Will you take this to Danny? Please. Sure I will. Thank you. Come along, Alice. One, two, and three, and four and five and down. Up, two, three and four, five and down. And change and good, three, four, five, and down. And change and one, two, keep it up. Good. Another letter. Man, don't you realize? This guy doesn't care about you. He does so care. Is that why he's written you so many letters? No, he's-- I mean, I'm sure that... Listen, the way I figure it, you wanna survive here, forget about the guy who knockedyou up in the first place. I don't want to forget about him. Look, Danny and I are in love and we're gonna be a family one of these days. You don't understand, do you? That baby's not yours. The minute it pops out, they're gonna whisk it off for adoption. You're not even gonna get to see it. What are you talking about? Of course, it's mine. Look, I want him. Who are they to take him away from me? That's the deal around here. The nuns take care of us now and the kid gets a good Christian home. Forget it, it's not your baby. It is so my baby. And no one's gonna take him away from me. Come on out here, Dan,and catch the windshield for me, will ya? How's Alice? Look, you can tell me how she is. You can't tell me how she is? From her? Yeah. She's been writing to him every day. Don't you think he has a right to see them? He should forget about her. But they're his letters. And it's her handwriting. Now, look, we don't need the aggravation, none of us. He's better off to be rid of her. Hello, dear. And here's the next pitch. Ball down on the third baseline. Anderson right on top of it and the Did I get any mail? No. I did, didn't I? Did I get a letter from Alice? Ma. He takes them because he thinkshe knows what's best for you. What do you mean "them"? That there's more than one? Where are they? He threw them out. I don't know. Maybe he's right. Maybe you should forget her. You're too young for all of this. Ma, Alice is my responsibility. What? You want her to take all the blame? What the letter say? Your father didn't read them. Was there a return address or a postmark or something? Ma, I got to know where she is. Ma, please. It's going back, going back. Come on. Your father would have a stroke. Ma, I gotta know where she is. Girls, come on now. It's time for chapel. Come on. Girls, come on now. Time for chapel. It's after one. You too, Alice. Sorry, sister. Jane. Well, what if I don't want to go. I don't care what you want. I'm telling you to go now. No. No. It's stupid and I'm sick of that church crap. I'm not going and you can't make me. Yeah. Girls, you wait in the hall. Go on. Jane, you have to go to chapel. It's the rule. -Why? -Because it is our policy. Well, fuck your policy. Oh, my God. You bitch. Stop it. Get back. It's all right. It is all right. We all know how Jane likes to overreact. Can't you see that she's hurt? She needs a doctor. How is she? Is she okay? What happened? Alice, sometimes God works in ways which are difficult for us to understand. Is it Jane? The miracle of life is one which only God can bestow and only God can deny. Stop talking about God. How's Jane? It's her baby. Jane's baby is dead. - No, no. - Oh, God. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, no. May I go in? Can I see her? Make it brief. She's very tired. I'm sorry. Sorry. I wanted to get rid of my baby because I was afraid I'd screw her up like everything else. You know? I... Oh, Alice. I wanted that baby so much. I really did. We were gonna be such good friends, me and her. It was a girl. Did they tell you? My daughter. I could be a good mother. I could. I could. You will be, Jane. Someday, you will be. Just don't let them take your baby. Please Alice, whatever you do, don't let them take your baby. -Yes? -Hi. Uh, I'm looking for Alice Courtney. -Uh, is she here? -I'm sorry. Visiting hours aren't until Sunday. Oh, well, uh, this is the only day that I could make it. Then you'll have to come back Sunday, won't you? No, see, I don't live around here. I had to drive 10 hours to get here and... uh, I have to see her now. I'm sorry. Rules are rules. Well, why don't you have her come down here? That wouldn't hurt anything, would it? That really isn't the point, young man. And I want you out of here immediately. Look, the point is, are you gonna help me or not? I can't. Uh-huh. Well, thank you very much, sister. God bless you. Come back here. You can't go in there. Now, wait. -You stop. -Alice! - Wait. - Alice! Alice! Alice! Have you seen, uh, Alice Courtney? Do you know where her room is? Alice! Alice! Alice! Alice!

It's great. Our kid's gonna be terrific. Oh, Danny. Well, let's go. - Go where? - I don't know. One thing for sure we can't go home unless you want to visit me in jail. You mean, you really don't know where we're going? What do I know? I'm just a driver. Where do you want to go? I don't know. New York. Danny, why don't we go to New York? New York. Are you crazy? No. Look I lived there for 10 years. We can make it there. I know we could. You think a dummy like me couldfind a job in New York? In New York City. There's millions of jobs there, thousands of apartments. You can do anything in New York. Really? Sure. Yeah, New York, huh? - New York. - All right. New York! New York! Excuse me, we're closed. You're gonna have to leave, okay? Is that it? Yeah. Hey listen, maybe you could help me. Um, I'm trying to sell my car. What do I look like? Joe Ford dealer? Car lots are in Queens.

Well, what are we going to do now? I don't know what we're going to do now. I'll think of something. You know, maybe, God forbid, you could get off your ass and find a job. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Don't you think I work hard enough doing your laundry and making meals? Taking care of Laura and stayingup with her all night? Because you're too tired? You're full of shit. I mean, we can't live like this. This is fucked. Can't make it. I never thought we ever could. We thought we could because we can. It'll be okay. Look, I'll get job if that's what you want. That's not the point, Alice. Look, I can't stand it anymore, all right? I want out! We're both too young for this shit. You should go back to school and I want to get a job, alright? I want to travel. This is not going to work, man. I'm crazy, okay, I'm doing crazy things. Danny, don't talk like that. I love you.

Well, what's he think my chances are? It depends on a lot of different things. Come on, Alice. Tell me the truth. He said you could get up to 18 months. 18 months for what? Look, it's not final. You might not have to stay here at all. In conclusion, Your Honor it's my contention, that by showing a complete, and acute, disregard for the consequences of his own actions. The defendant has proven himself to be unfit to function in society. It is the recommendation of the prosecution that the defendant be found guilty on all counts, and that he be sentenced to the state penitentiary for a term of confinement of not less... than 18 months. Thank you, Your Honor. The state rests it's case. Okay. After long consideration of the reports and evidence in this case, it is my finding... that Daniel John McClure should hereby be sentenced to one year's probation. And that he be released to the custody of his parents in Brighton, Illinois. We made it. Yeah, we made it. Daddy? Daddy? Daddy.
