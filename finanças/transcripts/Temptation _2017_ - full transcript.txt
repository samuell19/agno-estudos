Well hello. Haven’t seen you here in ages. You alright? Great. Is he in? Yeah. He’s in. We have a lovely evening planned. You should, uh... you should join-- What he sees in you, I’ll never know. Same old reserved attitude. Can’t say it got me anywhere. Maybe you should try my technique sometime. Hello boy! So, what brings you here? I hadn’t seen you in a while, with you being away and all. I’m well. Are you working tonight? Yeah I’m on my way there now. Best be off then. No time for talking. I thought we could catch up? You heard him. No time for talking. Austin, be quiet! Look. We’ll catch up soon. Right now, I’m fine. Always a pleasure. Give me a call if you fancy joining us. Down the rabbit hole. Would you like a drink? Or... No. Thank you. You got here fast. I try to be efficient. That’s good. Come on then. Sorry? Come on then!! You can get out my flat now. The money’s by the front door. Good choice, that. Sorry? Your record. I love Beethoven. Yeah, me too. Have to force my boyfriend to listen to this sort of thing. I haven’t seen you around here before. I just moved to the area. What was your name? It’s Naomi. Naomi. Who likes Beethoven. Well, this is a great place. I... know the owner; he’s always getting great stuff in. So you’re known well around these places, then? In certain circles, yeah. Well, since you’re new to the area maybe I could show you around sometime? Can I help you mate? Sorry? Well from where I was standing it looked like you were making a move on my girl. Hugh, don't. No. I wanna know what this guy’s problem is. You think you’re a big guy talking to someone else’s girlfriend, don’t you? That’s all we were doing. Talking. Hugh, don’t do this. Please stop. Maybe you should just fuck off. Maybe you should listen to the lovely Naomi and... stop. Do we have a problem here, fellas? Do we? No. No problem at all. You think you’re fucking clever. Letting yourself in now are we? Do you ever go out? Or are you always here on your knees to Henry’s every whim? Is he in? Bedroom. Come in. What do you want? I need some time off. I’m going through some things and-- No. Sorry? You’re not taking any time off. Did you bring my money? It’s on the table. Good. So you go out tonight. Keep on doing what you do. And I’ll keep on doing what I do. No more moaning about time off. That’s not how this works. Are we clear? Good. Now... get out of here. If you don’t mind. I’ve got a whim to take care of. Oh, hey Rose. Hello yourself. I have your shopping. You’re gonna go crazy if you stay in there you know? Maybe. I know what happened to you was tragic. But how a human reacts to adversity, that’s what shapes their character. Just don’t let this defeat who you really are. Hey. Alright Bro? Sorry I missed you again. Mum and I haven't heard from you in a while and... Just call when you can yeah? What are you doing? I told you to do the dishes. I’m taking your sister out to ballet, they better be done when I'm back. Hey. You okay? Just remember what I always tell you. Charming. We haven't seen you in a while. Come back. Henry wants you back. I don’t think so. You still in that nice flat? Maybe I could come down and see you? No. I moved. I’m somewhere else now. We heard what happened to you. Henry is sorry. He’s sorry now is he? Not when it happened, not when it mattered. We can make it up to you. It’s too late. It’s never too late. Is he there? He's always here. Hello boy. What do you want? We miss you. It’s been a long time. I don’t care, I’m not coming back. We have clients who miss you too. I don’t care. I’m not letting it happen again. Where are you? I think you should mind your own business. If only everyone minded their own business, the world would go round a great deal faster than it does now. You are my business, boy. You’ll always be my business. I don’t care where you are now, or where you need to go, you’ll come back. And what if I don't? We will see each other again. It doesn’t matter which way you choose to go, I know you’ll make the right decision and come back. You’re blind to it now, but you’ll see. Hi. Hi, how are you? I’ve… been better. I’m Anna. I just moved in, over there. You’re quite shy aren’t you? I don’t get many visitors. Don’t really like going outside. How about just there, next door? Sorry? I’m having a small dinner party tomorrow, I want to get to know my neighbours. Do you want to come? That’d be nice. I think I need to get out of here. Tomorrow night. What the fuck are you smiling at, boy? My sister’s got a new place. A small flat in the city. I thought we could go and-- Forget it. Shut the fuck up. Hey. Goodness! Am I really seeing you leave your home? Oh I’m just going next door. Ah yes, the new people. I’ve seen the man out and about. Wasn’t too sure on him. Just a bit... Have a good night. Thanks Rose... Hello! Hi. Smells nice. I didn’t cook. Don’t have to be kind for the sake of it. Honestly it does. My father’s the cook. I’ll warn you. He has some… colourful friends. Really? Don’t worry. You’ll love them. Are you ready? Ready? That’s my father’s friend. He doesn't speak. Right. I’ll go and check on dinner. Make yourself comfortable. Come sit down. There should be a few more people coming I think. I hope. There’s enough food to feed a small village in the kitchen. That’ll be the rest of the guests. Oh look darling, a new boy to party with. Oh how lovely. Good evening. Only a few months left now, John. A few months until what? Well until he can speak again. Why can’t he speak now? He spoke out of turn. Which Anna’s father doesn’t take kindly to. There are certain rules we abide by, I, of course, would never break those rules, but, John here, did. Yes, he did. All ready now. Looks great, Anna. Very nice. Don’t you think our new guest should sit at the head of the table? Oh definitely! Definitely! Sure. So how have you been, dear Anna? Well, thank you. And you? Perfect! We’ve been perfect. Ah, you must be the boy from next door! Welcome! Hello. Hope you enjoy the food! There’s lots of things on the table so you’ll find something you like I’m sure. Shall we have some music? Lovely idea! My favourite. How delightful. I do love this one. Don’t I darling? He does! Sit down, father. He doesn’t listen to anything else. I quite like it. So, do you like this sort of music? Yeah, I do. It’s fantastic! Can’t beat it! Anna likes this stuff too. Don’t you dear? Yeah, grew up on it, Dad. Well, this looks delicious, though I say so myself. It sure does. You may even rival my dinner party from month. It was a rousing success, the best dinner party any of us have ever had. Isn’t that right, dear? Best one ever. So, what do you do? I don’t do much anymore. Bloody young people. Don’t do anything anymore. I did so much at your age. Shocking state we live in nowadays. Would you like some whiskey? Yes please! So why don’t you do anything? Can’t be bothered? When I was your age, assuming you're around mid-twenties, I set up a charity to help the homeless in the area. The charity was a success and, I’m considered almost a God in some places. Humility is a fantastic trait. Excuse me? Nothing. Sorry for having done something with my time! So really. Why don’t you do anything? Where’s your charity? I don’t go out much. Why not? Scared of the outside? Have you ever read Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland? Well, a long time ago. Alice is scared throughout the whole story. She’s afraid of what she’s becoming. What’s happening to her. She changes in size; she wonders what that’ll bring. We fear what we don’t know. That’s why as humans we have to take leaps of faith. But doesn’t Alice meet dangerous creatures in Wonderland? She does. But she learns not everyone is out to get her. And people help too. You have to face your fears to grow as a person. I sure don’t remember the book that way. I’m sorry about him. And her. It's fine, honestly. Who doesn’t love having their life compared to a children’s book? You really don’t like going outside? I feel safer inside. Well, I did. Maybe we can get away from everyone after dinner. Sorry? You know you can have me. Anything you want. Give in. You think you’re fucking clever? Beautiful, isn’t it? You never been around this area then. Can always tell when somebody’s seeing this church for the first time. Going in? Still deciding. Something on your mind? Could say that. Going somewhere? Not much of a talker, eh? I get that a lot. To be honest... Glenn. Glenn. I am lost. And I’ve no idea where I’m supposed to go. It’s almost like you’re stuck in-- Don't say it. What? You were gonna say I was stuck in some sort of purgatory, weren’t you? That’s neither here nor there. Very good. I’m sure you’ll find your way. Sometimes it takes a little time to figure out which path to go down. Sometimes fear holds us back form deciding. Sometimes it’s deeper. Sometimes you just have to take leaps of faith.
