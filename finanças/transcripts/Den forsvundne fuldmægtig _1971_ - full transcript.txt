In April last year, two men disappeared in Copenhagen. It was reported to the police every few hours. Otherwise, the two apparently had nothing to do with each other. One was a recluse and an oddball, - - who lived in difficult financial circumstances. The other was a family man, civil servant - - and secured in every way. They were born in the same year. It could be a coincidence,- - but it contributed to the explanation that people had noticed it. (a big bang) Leif, you have to eat up! What wouldn't father say, - - if he saw how you stick to the food. You will never grow up then. Leif the Lucky ate buns in celery every day! What shall we do, little Leif? (the phone is ringing) - It's on duty speaking. - It's Mrs. Amsted. My husband has not come home from the office. - What is your address? - Upsala street 22. He usually . - Do you have a phone? - Yes... Obro 8471. - What is your husband's first name? - T-e-o-d-o-r. - Where does your husband work? - He is a clerk. - In the Ministry of Defence. - And have you tried there? He usually leaves the office at 17 and will be here 20 minutes later. - Has he been gone for only 3 hours?! - He always tends to be precise! That's more than 3 hours! His secretary says he left at 14. - An express letter had arrived. - And who sent that letter? Now you've heard of husbands, - - who made small, what shall we call it... on the way home … - What do you mean? - Nothing. They will to hear from us. We have not received a report of anyone by that name from the emergency rooms. Now you have to take it easy, he will probably show up soon. Yes. Thanks. Leif… (the clock strikes 9) Goodness, it's 9. Then you don't have to wait any longer for father, Leif. You have to get up early tomorrow. Brush teeth. You've been reading your homework, right? So you go to sleep right away, right? - Good night. - Good night. Sleep well. (shooting in the background) (emergency) I was on firing practice with the battery. I had to mark a case. Could it have hit a passerby? No, because then we would have seen the detonation. - And then… - Try just one more time. - Dynamite. - Yes, 2 kilos. 14.34. I can't say anything today. Call me tomorrow. - I'm just going to... - No, we're busy here. Well, have you measured and photographed? Yes. Just as I stand there with the clock, I saw the remains there of… - How did it feel? - It was very realistic. It looked like the war movies I've seen. I think that's how it goes in reality. Well, there's not much to see. We don't have much to go on. The medical examiners say a man of 35, 40, maybe a little more. Maybe a beard, maybe just a moustache. - Then there's the jacket here. - (the phone is ringing) Yes? Only two? It is really easy to understand. Sometimes it seems as if the city has drifted apart. Thanks. It was the jacket. It is of fine quality. But worn out. Maybe it was bought used. There is a mark which may be the man's initials CD. There are fingerprints on the gold watch. This is not something we have in stock. Two men have been reported missing in the last 24 hours. See if they have dynamite in their past and are missing a gold watch. Criminal assistant Munk. Will I meet Andrea Olivia Muller? - What can I do for you? - May I come inside? What could I have done though? This is your lodger, Michael Mogensen. - Thought it was me. Have you found him? - May I … It is a routine examination. If I may ask you a few questions. Yes, go ahead and sit down. They have not provided a job title for Mr Mogensen. I have no idea what he does for a living. He studies. He has not had a permanent job. - He wasn't at the social services office. - What is he studying? Books, newspapers. He was once a real student... at the university, but then... How is Mr. Mogensen living? He is unwashed, but otherwise calm and composed. He must originate from... - Does he drink? - No. And ladies! A complete monk! Except the other day when he had guests over for dinner, with beer! - What does he pay for it? - 80 a week if he pays. But then it is also furnished. A terrible mess. I have often offered to clean for him. He's a pig. But each time he gets very angry and says: "I beg your interference." "You can keep your cleaning frenzy to yourself." - Have you seen Mogensen with that one? - Yes, he had some of those clothes. Good day, Mrs. Olsen. Criminal assistant Munk. They have a customer named Michael Mogensen. Have you spoken to him in the last few days? Spoken... He always uses some nice words. How was he that night? Why does it always happen to Mogensen? - One has to be the jackass, right? - Mogensen is not happy about it. - Was he in a bad mood? - Nah. He gave a shit and said: "Screw it all." There was nothing noticeable about him. He wasn't happy or sad? Well, we sat and talked and had some gewesen as one calls it. Then he got drunk. When he gets drunk, he gives speeches… in English. Do you remember what he said? I'm an old sailor, so I understood it perfectly. He said something about: "I am the last humanist in Europe." "One of the noblest figures in our history will die with me." - HS, HS, message 649. Shifter. - 649 come. There are some remarks the night before he disappeared about his death. Yes, and then he was drunk. Do you have something? Nothing but some initials on the gold watch. Letters TA.. You'd better take a closer look at this Teodor Amsted. Understood. 649 changes. Yes, Deputy Amsted did not show up today - - in the Ministry of Defence, why I... He received an express letter yesterday at 2 pm and left the department. Well... Then the police are better informed than I am. There may be others here who can do better. Clerk Degerstream. Ask Ms. Lilienfeldt come in here. Immediately, Mr. Office Manager. - (there is a knock on the door) - Come in. Ms. Lilienfeldt, criminal assistant Munk. What's wrong? Is it agent Amsted? Did you witness Amsted leave the office yesterday at 14? - Yes, Has anyone reported him? - Did you see anything unusual? He forgot his hat and cane. Should I pick it up? Nah… I mean, right before he left. A postman arrived with an express letter. He immediately got busy. It might be him who… - What? - The children's lure in Church street. - Thanks, that's all. - Why. Yes, thank you, thank you very much. We have nothing to complain about agent Amsted. He is respected by everyone here in my office. - There are no difficulties? - Not at all. - He is a man of order. - What is your impression of him? I have the best impression of him and of his lady. They have come to my home on certain occasions. Has agent Amsted had the opportunity to - - dealing with explosives? Now you exceed the limit of your assignment! I can't comment on that! We are in the Ministry of Defence. - Won't you sit down? - Thanks. They must apologize. Nothing has been done today. I don't understand what could have happened. He must have gotten sick. Yes, maybe. They haven't noticed anything? - He hasn't been nervous? - Not at all. I also always made sure it was calm around him. He hasn't changed in any way? He is so orderly and regular. I don't understand how he can put me in that situation. Has your husband had financial difficulties? My husband does not incur debt. He has his affairs in order. - Do you have a life insurance? - Why do you ask? - May I see it? - Yes, it's here. It was drawn when we got married. It's been 18 years. That was the year my husband got his position after his legal exam. - How many kids do they have? - Only Leif. Oh, poor Leif. I thought to send him to the countryside. Over to my brother, chief physician Mörtel in Silkeborg. Has there been insanity in your husband's family? Insanity... in the family? How can you believe that? In the Amsted family? His entire family have been civil servants. Does your husband have any special interests? His main interest is his work in the ministry. But other than that… no. His home is everything to him. Then there is his stamp collection. He has over 6,000. I don't have much sense about such things, it's more for men. I'm glad he has a hobby that ties him to home. Yes, I will have to look in your husband's papers if I may? - We have to find something we can go after. - Yes, of course. There is nothing in his stash that I do not know. He never got one letter he didn't show me. Our life together is not like other people's. We are everything to each other. He has the same picture in his office at the ministry. His thoughts are always with us. He needs us around him. This really is his little cave, the office here. Here he sits in the evening, when Leif has gone to bed. Does the name Michael Mogensen mean anything to you? No, I've never heard that name. Does your husband have a gold watch with engraved initials? Yes. Why do you ask that? Well, nothing. Good morning, Ms. Lilienfeldt. Good morning, Deputy Degerstrom. Deputy Degerstrom! - What is it? - An important letter to the office manager. With T. Amsted as sender. Yes, here we have to be unorthodox and suspend business. We request the head of office to let it flow to him directly. When he comes. - The watch is from Amsted. - So are the clothes. CD stands for Chestertown-Deverill. One in Wide-street has exclusive sales of that substance. Amsted had all his clothes sewn by him. Mogensen's vest had the same brand. Then they are probably blown up at once together. - Good morning, miss. Lilienfeldt. - Good morning, Mr. Office Manager. I have an important personal letter for the office manager. They have been here long enough to know the usual channels! Clerk Degerstrom thought we should request the head of office - - about letting it flow directly to him. Good morning, Mr. Office Manager. Yes, that is my opinion. If it is a declaration of war from Luxemburg, - - then it's the Prime Minister's Office. You know that. Degerstrom! Clerk Degerstrom. Something has happened, something that concerns the honor of the ministry. - Clerk Amsted is dead. - Is he dead? In a disgraceful way. He has blown himself up - - by filling the pockets and mouth with dynamite. So it's him at Amager Felled? Now the office will be mentioned in connection with that scandal. You good god! It's terrible. His poor family. Yes, he orders me to tell his wife what happened. Regarding the motive, he is only able to inform, - - that it is not due to marital relations. It is a personal dissatisfaction with his deed that… His deed here in the office? How can it be unsatisfactory? Yes, but he writes in this resignation letter, - - that his expectations of life have not been satisfied. "Blissful" and "Church bell, no." - Isn't that enough? - You usually have three. What does the lady think about "Lovely is the earth" when the coffin is carried out? Yes… the… eventually, yes. Yes, it will be beautiful. Then there is the side light. Sidelights in the chapel cost DKK 80. - Do you want the side light on? - Is it necessary? It is very dark in the chapel. Well… well, we'd better get the sidelight. There is no need to save for the DKK 80. It's nicer when the side lights are on... How about trees? - What trees? - Laurel trees. DKK 15 each. There are no trees planned in the normal burial. Laurel trees. isn't anyone in tubs - - outside receptions? These are long-like like cypresses. It looks more festive with trees. For example, a tree on each side. Good, let's get those trees. So there is no more, is there? Then there is no more. Then everything should be like this, - - that you will be satisfied. They will think it is beautiful. (church bells ring) (fierce push) It is me! I'll fill up. - A pack of Bellman Cigarillos. - Bellman, yes. - 4.90. - I have no less in Danish. How everything has changed out here. It's been 30 years since I last visited here. I have been abroad quite a bit abroad. - America. - Well, well. I had to meet a parcel list Jens Jensen. Where does he live? A parcel list? Well, the health insurance fund! It is precisely in that direction. A yellow house with a hedge and a white picket fence, There is a sign and a mailbox. Yellow house with white picket fence. And straight up. Thank you. - They don't have a walking stick, do they? - Nah. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. (being scolded) What the hell are you staring at! Take a look and get started! (he knocks) Well, just come in! - Oh, good day. - What do they want? This is Herbert Johnson. We talked on the phone. Well, you are the one who wants to rent the apartment. - Don't you want to sit? - Thanks. I didn't expect you already. It's not done right. I had the impression that I could move in immediately. I didn't know you came right after. Do you have no luggage? Yes... my suitcases will arrive later. I don't really know... I have to talk to my daughter about that. Karen… Karen! Karen. Good day. This is Herbert Johnson. - Can that man move in now? - Now right away? - I have to clean up a bit first. - I could go for a walk in the meantime? An hour? - Yes, that might be good. - Then I'll do it. Oh, just a hesitation. We might as well get it over with. I would like 3 months rent in advance. I said that too. There has been someone who wanted the apartment, but you came first. - Do you want the money now? - Yes, please. It's just 2000. Those are my dollars. - 1,2,3,4. Here you go. - Thank you. It is a beautiful region. A little inland are the larger farms. Solid well maintained farms. The owners are decent people, - - who pay interest and taxes on time. There is only one person that is struggling. He can't make it through the term, says the neighbour. Hihi, he's smoking out. Then there are the parcel lists and the householders. They toil and struggle and just manage to cope. Hello, hello, You there! What are you doing here? It is private land. They are my flowers, You pick! - I thought they were wild. - God, they are wild! I have sacrificed in expensive judgments to put up signs. People are tearing them up! I have spent DKK 2,000 in expensive judgments on signs just this year. - I haven't seen any signs. - Do you live out here? Yes, I have rented from Jens Jensen. I don't want Copenhageners to spoil my land. - Doctor Ejegod. - Herbert Johnson. (a dog barks) - (the dog whines) - Shut up, dog! - Excuse me, what are you saying? - It wasn't for you, for the dog. - Are you the new tenant at Jensen's? - Yes. - Hageholm. - Herbert Johnson. They haven't come to hunt, have they? If you shoot at my piece, you'll be dealing with me! I can't shoot. I will teach one such a duke that if you shoot on my land. Goodbye. Come on, Quick. There are enough problems occupying the minds. Disputes and contradictions. Martin Hageholm is busy. He knows people. He has been a postman. He knows everything and is not afraid to pass on his knowledge. You know each other well out here. One day a stranger came. Nobody knew anything about him. It was assumed that there was something wrong with him. Yes, it's just up the stairs and then to the right. - I can go again, if. - No, I'm done. - We hope you will be satisfied here. - There can be no doubt about that. Karen! Karen!! What kind of monkey did you get living? Copenhageners? More like an American. He just came from over there. - What is he? - Well, hard to say, but he has enough money. - What does he want out here? - Well, he has to be somewhere. The Copenhageners make expensive time. And now also in the off-season? What is he thinking?! People have become complacent. - Have you heard about Anders? - Anders from the bog? No. He has written to the Minister of Social Affairs. You got your connections. He gets no well fare here! It was like when I was in the help desk. Then the fishermen would have support. But I said no. Then they complained to the minister, and then I wrote: "How can a fisherman be unemployed when the sea is open." Nice one. Well, you better go in and order something. I have a new lock for my ruses. - Do you steal your eels, Martin? - Anders is sneaking around down there. It's burglary if he tampers with my drugs! Bye. Bye. - Good morning, Mr. Jensen. - Good morning. - Nice weather this morning. - Yes, yeah… I have allowed myself to borrow a bag. I'll get some provisions. You must be allowed to do that. - Good morning, Mr. Jensen. - Good morning. - Yes? - A morning set. You probably got up late today. Yes. - With or without sausage rolls? - Sausage roll? Well, with. - You don't have to. - No... but with sausage rolls. A morning, with. (singing from the kitchen) - What's your name? - Herbert Johnson. - What are they called? - My name is Alice. - You, Alice? - You and Alice. (singing from the kitchen) It's the Inn madam. She has been to a luxury hotel on Costa del Sol. It can't be your seriousness, - - that a man like you will suddenly be a burden to the public! Aren't you ashamed of it? There is nothing dishonorable about receiving social assistance. Yes, help is help no matter how you twist it. Good thing your mom and dad didn't have to experience this. They would have sunk into the ground in shame. Yes, Emma, ​​I will try to apply for it. In a week's time. Yes, but that's fine. Goodbye. - What can we do for you? - I wanted to inquire. Not too good with the hously... Was there a possibility of an agreement on some kind of half-board? - Is it dinner? - Yes, please. We're not used to that here. Karen! - But it costs a little extra. - I had expected that too. - Karen, he wants dinner. - Now? - No, tonight and so on. - Could it be done? It should be possible, right, Karen? Yes, it is good enough with sun. But everything is good in moderation. - I think it's comfortable. - It goes to people's heads. The girls get silly and do different things if you get what I mean. Now the rack has come up here. They deplete my hunt for game. - You must do something about that. - I've done everything! Tried everything. I've shot salt cartridges in the butts of their rutts. And I have reported the bicycle smith to the police. He has done his emergency on our garden table. But the law cannot do anything without evidence. There was nothing to be done, the officer said. Only a shit can make that shit. Well, I must move on. Johanne! Him, the American running around with a fishing net. He just made himself up, and then he's running around with something like this! I'll come after him! (there is a knock on the door) Yes, come in. - I could do that. - Well... well, it was just a bit of dust. - Have you finished with the tray? - Yes, please. - Those were lovely chops. - It was steaks. Teodor Amsted's spirit lived on in the home in Upsala-street. He stood in his leather frame and was involved in everything. He had more to say than when he was alive. He made decisions and settled questions of doubt. What would little daddy say if he knew you were now leaving food again? For Teodor Amsted, it was not important that he was dead. Whether he himself sat in the armchair made no further difference. Every month his pension would be paid to Mrs. Amsted. But Mrs Amsted was also paid out a not inconsiderable life insurance. Those left behind were well insured. Well, it's bed time. Leif the Happy was fresh in the morning, - - before he went out and conquered the world. Remember to brush your teeth. Go to sleep immediately. That made your father so happy. Good night, little Leif. Where are you going? If you come after me, you will get a beating! And if I see you on my hunt, you'll be shot between the eyes. Watch your own place instead of patrolling everyone else! What! Look at that duke! He's going to get a shot of hail in the back! - Stop! - (he fires a warning shot) Hands up! Well, what's going on here? Around! Well, is it you, American! If I had taken you for a buck, what would you have looked like? It's like in Nebraska! I got a decent calorie intake! It had to have 5 shots. You can jump in the back and I'll drive you home. Jump into the King's Lodge. "Don't let that buck pass your nose," I said to myself. Come, Quick, in with you. Jump up to the American. Like that... Then it got all it could take. Down it had to go! Take it home to Johanne, then maybe we can beg for a cup of coffee. It's Johanne, it's my housekeeper. They mustn't make all that trouble for me. It is no inconvenience. Go ahead and eat. It holds up well. And it's cheap. Yes, it tastes good. How much do you give at Jens Jensen? - 8,000 per year. - It's too much for that hole. Move up here, here is a nice apartment, insulated and running water. Close to Brugsen and the bus stop. And the inn. And then there's the phone, which you can borrow. DKK 10,000, that's what I get for the summer. - I can't move early. - No, of course. Now you know if you want to move. Yes, that's my daughter. She died 5 years ago. There is nothing in life when your loved ones pass away. She sucked on a blade of grass, got tetanus and died. There must have been a bacillus. - A blade of grass?! It's sad to be lonely. (a cat meows) - Are you the one playing the piano? - No! It was my daughter. There was someone the other day who wanted to play on it. "Nah, the hands that played it died." "No hand shall touch it again," I said. It's my wife. She was pretty once. But that doesn't last. She was no natural woman. When women cannot bear children, something is wrong. She was otherwise a good party! Her dad had a big farm. But he didn't want us to have each other. After all, I was just a mean country postman. He wrote a will and only the children could inherit, only the kids. He knew very well that she could not have children. But I made the wife fat, and out came the kid. But the mother died ... that is, my wife. She had her good sides. Then my daughter died just before she was to be married. Then I got the money. Then there were boats for the villa, car and all the pipe clothes. The old man should have known that! What do you say, Johanne? (step on the stairs) It is the national register. You are not registered there. - The National Registry? - You don't have that in the States? It's like holding a census. - Is it something I have to fill in? - Yes. - Are you the one to have it? - Yes. - I will do that. - Yes, so... goodbye. Johnson... Herbert. Social security number, date of birth 7.2.24. Serial number. 1145. Married… Married. Single? The police are still working on the case, - - where cand.law. Teodor Amsted blew himself up. On the same day, unemployed Michael Mogensen disappeared in Copenhagen. Yes, we are working on the case... or cases. We have been confirmed that the two knew each other. A lecturer has explained that they were classmates. The police have established that there was a connection between them. If you put the flowers for father in the vase there, - - then it will be so beautiful and neat. Michael Mogensen, the friend from school, - - was good in the class, they both belonged to the best. They would probably turn out to be something, it was said. But it doesn't matter that much to be among the best in school. He thinks of a disgusting sight out there on the field. - Hello. - Good day. - Tea? - No thanks, coffee today. You go right to it. Do you need something in it? Sugar, please. - Sugar! How about a little one? - A small one? Yes, a schnapps. You look hang-beaked. I'm a bit tired. A schnapps, please. Have you been in town all day? - Yes. - What have you purchased? A walking stick. You gotta take care of yourself on top of those ghost stories lately, huh? No, it's just nice when you go for a walk. - What do you do when you're not walking? - Nothing. - Why not? - I can't think of anything else. (a car stops, a door slams) Johnson! Johnson! Here we go! Anders from the bog is going in. Come, come! That comes out of complaining to the minister, - - when you don't have pure flour in the bag. Then there will be an investigation in the papers. Just demand without giving anything in return! No, no! You have to give before you can enjoy. It is my language of choice. It's good for everyone, including him. And at least for his children. When Anders wants both health and social assistance, - - then the hammer falls. What's it called, Jens? Social fraud. It's the little dung hut! Just forward. I'll take this one! Yes, it's him! Watch out, he has a knife in his hand! Yes, we disarm him. Come here, be careful, Jens! He is dangerous. There are 3 terms. Watch out for him! (there is a knock on the door) Well, Johnson, now the Copenhageners are on their way. Then there are no problems with renting out anymore. - It was good, you came first. - I am happy to live here. It's also a nice view. Karen! What kind of a way to lie down? Turn around! I think you use too much light. They walk too much in the same places on the floor, Maintenance such as varnishing is the responsibility of the tenant. It is normal custom. We would hate for the apartment to lose value. - I'll probably have it fixed. - There are enough people who want to rent out here. There are many problems in daily life that he has not foreseen. It is not easy to be independent, - - when others have decided everything 46 years. When he was a child, it was his mother. Later it was his wife. He has been a school boy for far too long. It is not out of curiosity that he has acquired knowledge. It was duty and preparation so he could be retired someday. But here he is of his own free will. He has made a decision himself for the first time in his life. He is no rebel, but deep down I guess there was a little will to live. A little longing for freedom. And now he's here, mr. H. Johnson from America. You there! Who gave you a fishing license to fish here? It's my part of the bog he's emptying out. - It's not fish, Mr. Hageholm. - Well, tadpoles. I would like to present them to you. The eels are mine if they get in the net! And the pike. Those outside will probably come by sooner or later. What's that over in those bushes? Well… ha-ha. As a child, he wanted an aquarium. But his mother forbade it. It made too much of a mess. And when he was an adult, his wife opposed it. Something like that smells. He is 46 years old now, soon to be 47. He is too late for everything. There he is, watch out! It's him! Good day, Teodor Amsted. Criminal Commissioner Skovstrup. Well, it's out here, you hide. Watch out, he's dangerous! Where are the handcuffs? He doesn't seem to be running anywhere. Shouldn't we change our clothes? If you go in, we'll be waiting. Look, he looks sneaky. Calm, but sneaky. He walks just as quietly and pretends nothing happened. But he is dangerous! He is dangerous! Leif is so loving. He has inherited his father's loving mind. I remember him like that too. When he was with us for the first time in Silkeborg, - - he sat by the lake with his little spoon and bucket. Such a beach with aquatic plants, small animals and water... A large and flourishing world for a small child's imagination. It is also for Leif's sake that I maintain the old home. - (the phone rings) - As long as it's nothing with Leif. I've been worried about him since he went to boarding school. Yes, hello? This is Mrs. Deputy Amsted. The police?! My husband?! What do they say?! Live? But that is impossible! My husband? No, no. Oh God! However, that was almost the worst that could happen! You don't leave your wife if you get along well. There wasn't an extramarital affair? - No. - We have examined your home. We have, among other things, found this little document. "You sit in the narrow cage of the kiosk and smile sweetly behind narrow windows." "While I have to stand in the rain and wind." I wrote that when I was 16. - What was that lady's name? - I really can't remember that, she worked at a kiosk. What did you disagree with your wife about? We have never disagreed on anything. So it was an arranged game to get the life insurance paid out? Has she been paid? - I overlooked that. - They can't eat us with it! - How much did you win in the lottery? - Do you know that too? - The note came out with half a million. - Half a note, i.e. 250,000. Why did you keep it a secret from your wife? I didn't know what to do with all that money. After all, they used them to live in the countryside. I hadn't decided to go to the countryside when I got the money. When did you decide to go to the countryside? After Michael Mogensen's suicide. And you are sure that Michael Mogensen committed suicide? It doesn't matter, but I don't remember from the years we studied, - - that you may not settle in a new place or change your name. It is not forbidden. But there is something else they can hang you on. There is the life insurance, which was paid out. - Yes, I had forgotten that. - Then there is the tax authorities. There is the lottery win. Then there is the one with the pension. And the wrong information for the national register. I also felt guilty when I filled it out. - Are you going to defend me? - Your wife asked me to. - What do I get? - 5-6 months, if we're lucky. That sounds reasonable. Unless they stick with the one with Michael. They have gone to school with Mogensen, - - and you continued to come together with him. Yes, I knew where he lived and sent some help once in a while. - What kind of help? - Some money and my old clothes. Why was your wife not allowed to know that you helped Mogensen? She wouldn't like. He said outrageous things and was not very well groomed. Was there any reason for you to support Mogensen? - He didn't put pressure on you? - No, we were schoolmates. How much money did you give Mogensen? Small amounts and DKK 5,000 from the lottery winnings. - Why the 5,000? - For a better room or new clothes. - Did he use the money for that? - I do not know. That is... unfortunately he probably used them to buy dynamite for. - Where did he get it from? - I do not know. They themselves were interested in explosives. It was professional. I was the secretary of a military political commission - - and had to familiarize myself with certain technical details. And you are sure that this is the case? If we have to look at it from a financial point of view, Teodor, - - then has your resurrection - - been a harder blow to your wife than your death was. The insurance sum must be repaid. She was paid the pension. There are costs to the case. Documents must be redone. You have been declared dead, e.g. She can get the rest of the lottery winnings. You have used some of it. Michael has got something. Tax must be paid on it and a tax penalty. Your wife wants the marriage dissolved. - Of course. - She won't find it difficult. Why don't you want to talk to her? You do that better than I do, Victor. She must sell the flat and the furniture and find a job. - What are you doing with Leif? - He has been sent to boarding school. Then there is the grave. Michael's grave was bought for 40 years. For you. We have to negotiate with his family about it, if he has any. It's handy if I'm in jail during all this. Before you left the ministry, you received an express letter. - Who was it from? - Michael Mogensen. He wanted to commit suicide with dynamite on Felleden. - What did you make of that letter? - I tore it to pieces. - So what did you do? - Then I went out to Amager Felled. Why didn't you call the police? I wasn't sure if Mogensen would take it seriously, he often talked about it. So what did you find? A big hole in the ground. It was horrible. They took your watch and broke it. Why? I wanted you'd think it was mine, Wasn't that a bit naive of you? Had the watch been in Mogensen's pocket, there was nothing left of it. - No, it was quite thoughtless. - Otherwise, it looks premeditated enough. When did you get the idea to switch roles with Mogensen? - Out on Felleden. - Why? Perhaps the name Herbert Johnson was also thoughtless? Yes. After all, there is a Herbert Johnson in Nebraska. Your schoolmate. His name was Herbert Jensen. It all looks very well thought out, Teodor Amsted. It was cunning to take the name of a Danish-American. Then you could enter the system as a Dane returned from abroad. It's not that little, you know. Where did Mogensen get the dynamite from? They themselves had to be able to obtain explosives more easily. It wouldn't be that easy. That would only be possible by violating the regulations. And someone like you would never indulge in that kind of thing. It would be more difficult for Mogensen than for you - - to get dynamite, right? Yes. You're known for right. Defendant Teodor Amsted is found guilty according to the indictment. The penalty is fixed for 5 months. Does the defendant want to appeal the sentence? Sir. Judge, I accept the verdict. Order has returned to Teodor Amsted's life. His day is divided. He has employment. There is meaning in it all. The work requires accuracy and order. It is monotonous, but no more monotonous - - than work in the Ministry of Defence's 14th devision. (a bell rings) Everything is the same as before, but it's still better than before. Before he was only lonely. But he couldn't be alone. He always had to be accountable. Here there are none of these ailments. He is protected. The door is locked. Whether it is locked from the inside or the outside does not matter. Here is safety, order, regularity and security. He has achieved what he trained for. He has reached the highest ideal of bourgeois society. But the blessed state cannot last forever. One day he is released and pushed into a harsh world. One that he does not understand, and that he has never learned to understand, There is only one thing to do. He can commit something, - - that brings him back to that prison, - - that fulfills his requirements for life. Teodor Amsted smiles. Because no one in the prison has any idea that the sociable man - - has decided to become a murderer. (loud music) I'd like to look at a hammer. A good, heavy hammer. Then it has to be this one. There is a good punch in it. If you want one who can pull out nails. - Nah. What does it cost? - It costs 15 crowns. We sell many of these. - How much does this one cost? - It is somewhat more expensive... 27.50. It's also a lovely hammer with a splendid strike. (the doorbell rings) Clerk Amsted?! What do they want? They better come inside. I would have thought you possessed so much tact,— - that you had spared me your visit. I cannot receive you after what has happened. A little gratitude. I ask you not to seek me out more often! Now you must go. I just want to make sure there's no one on the stairs. (loud music) Hey, Daddy. Michael! - My name is Teodor Amsted. - What is the case about? A confession. Murder and attempted murder. - You're not drunk, are you, sir? - The murder weapon is here. - They confess to the murder of Mogensen? - Yes, I murdered Michael. - Extortion? - He was insatiable. Why are you now making that confession? To protect the world from people like me. The guard said something about a confession of an attempted murder. Yes, tonight I tried to assassinate Office Manager Ohmfeldt. - With the hammer You submitted? - Yes. Ohmfeldt nothing happened? No. I had forgotten he had a gun collection. Why would you murder your former boss? There has been a lot over the years. Unreasonable infringements. Unnecessary humiliations. The office manager is the authoritarian type, tolerates no contradictions. That can't be a reason to kill him. For me it was. - Good night. - Good night. And thanks. Look what I bought for you. - Now I have to. - It's not heavy... Come on, Leif. It was nice of you to come along, Victor. Thanks. - Have a good time in Silkeborg. - We're having a wonderful time. Leif hasn't had fun since he came from boarding school. Being at your brother's house is not work! You've probably got the tithe law with you? Victor! Remember that thing with my maiden name, right? Now you have to get on the train if you want to go. It is coming home again to the real surrenders. - You come and visit us. - I'll do that. What are they saying? There are more than lakes in Silkeborg... Take care! Say hi to them over there. And a very merry Christmas. … angels sing of the child so beautifully. he has opened the door of heaven blessed is the song of the angels blessed is the song of the angels. One of these men was once a clerk in the Ministry of Defence. He had a good position and a beautiful home. But he wanted to try to have freedom. His life was destined to be under control... not freedom. Now he has reached his goal. He's here for life. Not all prisoners are as satisfied as Teodor Amsted. They have not had his good upbringing. They have had too much imagination, are inharmonious and uncivil. But for Teodor Amsted, the meaning of life is fulfilled. He has no more wishes. … rejoice every soul he has saved. --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
