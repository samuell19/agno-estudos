[music playing] [laughter] Still got it. I'm somewhat of aseparatist in that I hang out with other gay men, usually gay men around my age and from mysocioeconomic background. You know, I really am-- I like being around people who are just like me. Women want to be with women. Women get along with women better, all right? Men and women don't get along. Men and women are structurally different. I think there are times we forget how different. It's magnified in the gay men's communities and the lesbian communities. We only have one thing incommon, as far as I can see, is that we are on the sameside on the civil rights issue about gays andlesbians because we sleep with the same-sex partners. That's the issue we have in common. Everything else, I don't think there-- I don't we have anything in common. [men and women struggling] [twinkle] Um, I think that gay men,they look at relations a lot different than we do. I think they're passive about it too. It's like, OK, if it doesn't hang on, you know, that's all right. Whereas women are, I'm going to do everything I can to make it last, even if I know it's not going to. You know what I mean? Our culture teaches men in general that that is not their province. That's a woman's work. Women deal with relationships. And so in the straight relationship, you have the woman doing all that work and the man kind of being in the dark. But at least somebody's doing the work. In lesbian relationships, you have two people working very hard. In gay male relationships, you just have people at a loss as tohow to have a relationship. ELISABETH NONAS: For some reason, they can separate sex fromlove, which I don't think lesbians do quite as much. Why? I don't know. I mean, I wouldn't particularly want to. The male homosexual sensibilityseems to me very isolated and highly visual, highlycued to masculinity as being something out there, OK? So they begin to fall in lovewith the masculine, which is there, something which he is not. I am not that, but it is beautiful. KARL KNAPPER: You want what you want to be. So you want this hyper-masculine, straight-acting and appearing man, because you want to be a hyper-masculine, straight-acting and appearing man. ERIC MARCUS: I can look at a manobjectively as a piece of meat in a way that a lot of my womenfriends don't even understand, that it's not possible for them to look physically and be excitedby the visual in the way that I can be. The magazines here in this area of the store, which is the back area of the store, are largely male-oriented magazines. And the reason we keep it separate is because, frankly, a lot of women don't like being jostled by the men who hover around the magazine rack. This is the women's magazine rack. And it's created quite a stir, because there's a certain segment level of the lesbian community that doesn't like anythingthat is particularly sexual. We had some group anonymouslycome into the store one day and pour red paint all over them. Ostensibly all over "On Our Backs," but they really got it on "Off OurBacks" and other publications. Sex is a great activity, andI'm a real believer in sex. And I've had a lot of resistancein the lesbian community sometimes, because I like to talk about it. I like to talk about the nitty gritty. I like to talk about where youput your fingers and tongue. I like to talk about vaginas. You know, I like to talk aboutall the drip and the gush and the breasts hangingin your face and all that. And sometimes, you know, Ihave lesbians that are, eww. Courtship is basicallyfor the sake of the woman, for the sake of the female so she can select the male that she thinksis the best one to father her children. From the point of view of the male, courtship is just a waste of time. The male would simply like to go in there and have sex and get onto the next one, you know? It sounds really crude, right? But we're talking about justreally the nuts and bolts of the evolutionary strategy. For men, it's OK and encouraged to go out and conquest. Sure, sure. Whereas women, if theydo that, they're a tramp. So many relationships getscrewed, up because the women, they-- somebody-- the two women come together. They have this great sex, sothey think, oh my god, now I have to marry her. So they move in with her, whenreally it was just great sex. But you know, the honest to God truth is I can hardly wait to find somebody to walk down the aisle with myself. I mean, there's on the onehand the stereotype of lesbians and women generally that theynest, they like to couple, they like to pair. There's the old joke. What do lesbians bring onthe second date, you know? The U-Haul. And then, of course, there'sthe stereotype of gay men, and you go out the bar, and you've had five partners that night. Gay men now, because of the threat of AIDS, have become more monogamous. And there's the developmentof a lesbian culture which has taken over the sexualadventuring from the gay man. [club music playing] New York's a hard placefor a shy dyke like myself. I didn't have a date for sevenmonths when I first moved here. But now, it's all changed. The Hangar, one of the manygay bars here on Christopher Street, the gay mecca. It's pretty new. The guys are pretty old. We can go to a place which isone of my new favorite places. Come on, let's go. So here at the Boiler Room, the Boiler Room, which is not always a lesbianbar, you can get a pint of beer for 3.50 on a regular night. Like, we can go in here rightnow and get a 3.50 beer. And $2 on ladies' night. MICHAEL MUSTO: This is Boots & Saddle. It's one of those macho leather bars where if you don't wear adead cow, you can't get in. You have to be a man to get in here. But then when you get home,you have to be a lady. ROSE TROCHE: You don't wantto get too close to Babyland because of what happenedto our wonderful girl night we used to have for, I think it was two weeks, maybe. This is the Christopher Street Bookstore, and this is a landmark bookstore. However, it's not your ordinary bookstore. There's, like, littlebooths where people go in and sort of have anonymous sex. Oh, God. I read so many books. On Tuesday nights, thisused to be the Clit Club. And then that, like Babyland, is now-- well, we see it's now dead. Yeah. I mean, you know, the issueof lesbian, women-only space is always a little bit morehellish than it is for men, you know? I have to keep track of four or five different lesbian barsthat change their location every five minutes. And you know, that's a bit tedious. It's hell. JOHN THOMAS: The idea of anenergetic, sexual atmosphere in gay bars is something that is real. That if you bring a lotof lesbians in who do not necessarily have that samesexual thrust, that it puts a damper on the whole thing. MUSICIAN: [SINGING] I feel assquirrelly as a girly can be. She's so skinny and she'sso drawn, when she stands sideways, you think she's gone. But then she tells me, baby, I feel fine. To think she's frantically,romantically mine. She's tender, so tender. She makes my heart surrender. And every night, when I hold her tight-- Well, I tend to getalong better with lesbians than some of my friends do. And the comments I hear fromthem are, they're too serious. They don't have enough fun. You know, get a lesbian on a committee, and you'd be talking it to death. Women have a tendency to process and, you know, they have what I call the thousand-year plan for peaceand harmony in the universe, you know? And that's, like, well, we haveto be right on what's going on in El Salvador and our civilrights here and, you know, a coffee boycott. I don't think that lesbiansare less fun than gay men. That's sort of like the old reputation that the women's movement had ofbeing too serious all the time. We want pay equity. We want childcare. We want birth control and abortion. We want sex education. And we want the corporations andthe government to for pay it, I mean, I think we were kindof humorless in the '70s, OK? Gay men thought we were humorless, and we were sort of grim. We were fighting for our own lives back then. It's very hard for gay men to understand that, because so many gay men did come from privilege. SARA LEWINSTEIN: And they thought gay women were very cheap. What tips more, a dyke or a canoe? A canoe tips over. That's what it is. Just like, who invented potluck? Lesbians. It became kind of a stockepithet for describing the communities at the time, theschism between the communities, that we were the oddestpolitical bedfellows ever, a forced marriage if ever there was one. KARL KNAPPER: Often, lesbianswere more politically conscious then gay men, especially at the height, you know, the golden age of gaymale sexuality where, I mean, it was very hedonistic and wild and do whatever you want to do as longas you don't hurt other people. MARTIN DUBERMAN: Thedominant gay male institution in the '70s was the disco. You danced all night into a frenzy. You had sex with multiple partners. You did lots of drugs. You pleasured yourself. Men are entitled to get asmuch pleasure as they can. Whereas the prototypicallesbian institution in the '70s was the commune, in which the emphasis was on relatedness and sharing. CHARLOTTE BUNCH: For us, it wassuch a wonderful new discovery of another dimension ofourselves, our sexuality, and we were raising thequestion of lesbian oppression as an aspect of femaleoppression and compulsory heterosexuality as sortof one of the cornerstones of male supremacy, as we called it in those days. So we were, of course, wanting other women to leave their husbands andjoin us in our collectives and run off to create this new world. JOHN THOMAS: There were baths. There were baths where youdidn't take your clothes off, which actually were my favorite. And you didn't hear of anygathering of women sexually, but you did hear that they gottogether to talk about women's issues or read books. TORIE OSBORN: In fact, therewas an extraordinary amount of sexual creativity andexperimentation, and none of us was monogamous at that time in history. But still in all, it was a time where building community andfamily issues were probably at the top of our agenda. BARBARA GITTINGS: A great dealof women's efforts in the 1970s went into examining theroot causes of oppression. But examination and analysis usually led to more examination and more analysis and more examination and more analysis, and they never did anything. TORIE OSBORN: These were politicizing experiences as well as culturaland musical experiences. You know, 4,000 women in the woods. They were like Amazon Woodstock. MORRIS KIGHT: I had organizedagainst the war in Vietnam, and so I had radical connections all over. I knew a lot of lesbian women,and I invited them to join me in the Gay Liberation Front. And some did. However, the Gay LiberationFront took up men's issues. John busts. Whatever woman have you ever heard of who's been arrested in a washroom? And so here were men spendinghours and demonstrating about men's sexuality. It was not very appealingto a lesbian woman. There were the issues of family planning and pro-choice and jobs. Women were not very high in the job market. And we didn't address those issues. JIM KEPNER: I didn't seeany of them as cause issues, and I feel ashamed of that. I just said, well, they'reproblems of lesbian mothers. Well, what do you mean lesbian mothers? That generation of gay menequated freedom and being out with sexuality, of being able to have as much sex with as many people. This was not what my life was about. My partner had a kid, ason that she was raising. So I mean, he would get beat up at school because his mom was gay. DORIE BARRON: And when lesbianscame roaring out of the closet and started losing their children, when I tell this to a lot ofgay men that I know today, their mouths drop. They can't believe it. It's like, well, where were the boys? KIM CORSARO: There was aperception that the people that were getting power or inpower were primarily gay men and that there wasn'treally room for lesbians. By the same token, there wasa great deal of resistance in the lesbian community to any kind of organized, mainstream political involvement. MORRIS KIGHT: And some women went off on a lesbian separatist supremacist trip, saying that not only is lesbianmighty fine, but it's better. It's superior. I felt very discriminatedagainst in this city by gay men, and Artemis wasformed as a place for women to go and socialize that was women only. No men were allowed into this. And one of my employees was working, and her female lover came inwith their eight-year-old son. And I had this woman comeup to me and tell me, there's a man in here. And I went, that's a man? And she says, yes, and there's no men allowed. I said, that's a boy. I hung around with a lotof separatists at one time. They assumed I was a separatist. I had a child. And a lot of the women did not know what to make of me, because I had this representative association with a man. The communities were very separate. I mean, the male discos were, you know, the hot, happening places. KARL KNAPPER: Just like black people would be asked for three pieces of ID, they also had the open-toed shoe policy, which were ways of keeping anyone out who wasn't usually a white gay man. I had a very interesting slant on this, because I was a songwriter thatwas getting a lot of records, and I had actually a few hits that were being played in discos. And there was one that was "Starlove" that was their number onesong over at Studio One. And they'd say, you've got tocome at 2:00 in the morning. They play it, and then allthese guys get up and dance, and they do special dances. I was so excited, and I'd stand at the door. I'd knock, and somebody would finally open. And they'd say, oh, you'rewearing the wrong shoes. Because they didn't want to say, you're a girl, and you can't come in. Finally, I came back with my gold record, and somebody came out andsaid, OK, you can come in. That was in effect till justlast summer, the open-toed shoe policy, because of so many--in the state of Texas, particularly-- so many liabilities that fall within the business. If someone were to come inin open-toed shoes, step on a piece of glass, we would be liable. [country music playing] We're going to see whatit's like, how dykes country and western dance in Dallas. So we're gonna boot scoot on inside. CAMILLE PAGLIA: The few gay barsin the country had been mixed, and so there were a kind of fraternity of shared experiences as ostracized beings in that pre-Stonewall era. What happened after Stonewallwas the lesbian feminist going in one direction, OK, into its own bars, and then the gay male world flourished. Suddenly, this paradise gardenall in 10 short years, OK? AIDS was incubated. KIM CORSARO: It was a wild lifestyle. There's, you know,nothing like it to compare in the lesbian community. The VD truck would come into the Castro, and they would do STD testingon gay men for various things that they got so they couldcontinue to safely have sex and that it wouldn't developinto any sort of chronic, you know, disease thing, whichsome of them were getting into. And when AIDS hit, I heard itfrom lesbians time and time again. You know, well, look at the way they've acted. What did they expect? The anus became a glorified sex organ, and the buttocks the primary part of the sexual attractivenessof the male physique in male homosexual photography and movies and in the writing about it inthe late '60s and 1970s and on. Well, I wonder if nature really intended that. Because we know that whenthe AIDS virus came along in the '70s, late '70s and early '80s, that anal intercourse provided amethod of transmission that had never existed and known about. We'd never known about it before. Now, there's been sodomyand some anal intercourse throughout human history, yes. But when I came to SanFrancisco in the early '50s, I looked down on sodomites. If I knew a person had been-- hehad been screwing other people in the butt, I didn't want to go home with him and have sexual intercourse of any kind. We were limited to oral sexual activity and mutual masturbation. HARRY WAY: The Kinsey Report made the point as far as gay men were concerned that they probably had sex a littleless than once a month. And so in that case I was verylucky, because I was having sex about three times a week. But most of that would havebeen behind billboards, in vacant lots, behind certain bushes of abandoned houses or housesthat were dark or at the beach. JIM KEPNER: There were complaints from some of the women that if the menwould just stop being swishy or would stop having sex in public places or would stop making demands that all our troubles would be over. HAL CALL: But you see, it was mostly the male who was in trouble in those days, and he was the one that thepolice were trying to entrap. And the police were having fun chasing gay sexualists in the toilets. Our police always loved to play in the toilets. I don't know why. PHYLLIS LYON: The Alcoholic Beverage Control would send in handsome young men to try and pick them up. And then once they did, they'd arrest them. The other thing is that the ABC,probably like everybody else, felt it was much moreimportant to do something about male homosexuality andthat women weren't all that important in the first place. And in the second place, they probably weren't being sexualanyway, because women aren't sexual and all that stuff. JIM KEPNER: I got into the Mattachine, taken by a woman friend who was just in the process of coming out. And my first refutation of the frequently asserted statement that there were no women in the early movement-- one took me to my first meeting. And there were others there. Not many. Well, both Mattachine andONE were very male oriented in the publications and in their public meetings and programs, the whole bit. JIM KEPNER: Issues of male chauvinism were not generally being raised yet. And a few guys were crude enough to suggest, well, now that we've got some women here, you can be secretary. You can fix the coffee. HAL CALL: I've never had thatkind of a look-down attitude on women. We did have the feeling thatthe women were not in trouble like the males were, becausethe police officers weren't going in women's toilets. And women in their toilets weren't doing what the males were anyway. You know, lesbians werebeing thrown out of jobs. They were being thrown out of their homes. Their children were beingtaken away from them. They were committing suicide. You know, all kinds of thingswere happening to them. And some of them got arrested too for walking downtown alone at night. And lesbians got caught up in the gay bar raids. My favorite bar was rightdown the street near where that Thai restaurant is. That was called The Open Door. I met a woman here who was very butch. And since I didn't know what else to do, I considered myself a femme. And the cop came and saidthat she was a man in drag. She had to undress in front of a police matron to prove that she was a woman. And he said to me as a femme, you don't look like you're really one of those, and let me tell you that you better get out of this situation. And I don't want to see youhere ever again, and if I do, I'm taking you in. The point is that we were really harassed. JIM KEPNER: When the Daughtersof Bilitis organized, many of the men greatly resented it. We're fighting against segregation, and here you're buildinga segregated organization. We had an honorary categoryfor men who'd been particularly helpful to DOB, and they would be called Sons of Bilitis, SOBs. And this was a nice little touch. HAL CALL: Phyllis was editinga little publication called "The Ladder," a monthly magazine, and we printed that at ourown little printing company that we established. We printed that. And we did certain things jointly. And we always did things in an aura of cooperation and friendship. Most of the guys were friendly. It's just that as longas we were in their face, they were aware of this. Once we left, they forgottotally about women. BARBARA GITTINGS: When itcame to making some real dents in the discrimination inthe 1950s and early '60s, always we worked with the men. The women wore dresses. The men wore suits and ties. And I think what it did was to deflect attention from us as individuals--ooh, look at those queers-- and make it possible for people to pay attention to what was on our signs. And we did have verygood-looking picket lines. JIM KEPNER: The women were the first that I heard to propose that, look, my company expects those of us who aren't married to bring along a date at company dinners and such. I did that several times. Now, some of the men werealso happy about that, because in most companies you didn't get promoted very far unlessyou had a presentable wife and children. And there were lots of convenient marriages arranged out of that. The woman that I was living with and I married two gay men thathad been together for a while. They came over. They proposed. Seriously, yeah. Well, this was a double Orthodox Jewish wedding. And my mother knew and thoughtwe were possibly being idiotic. And then we bought a home together. Socially, it was kind of nice. But then there were a lot of differences, basically, between lesbianbehavior and gay male behavior. And we weren't accustomed to having them drag all these guys homefrom the bus stop and all that. And after a while, there were other things, like all the money was in the males' names. And as we all worked, that made no sense. So ultimately, we decidedto stop this thing, because they didn't think that the women should be able to write checksand things of that nature. The house itself was a jointly-owned property. Anything else, they really got everything. The whole society wasso saturated with sexism, and there was a woman-mocking language as part of gay subculture. I mean, it ranged from calling each other "she" to calling each other by women's names to calling each other "youfish," you know, as a putdown. And since I was a young woman not too secure in my own womanness, I realized that I could be a lesbian in their presence, but I really couldn't be a woman. Someone once said to me that gay men were more sexist than straight men, and I've found frequently that's true. But I've also found those gay men who get it, who understandthe connection between sexism and homophobia, to be some of the strongest feminists I've ever met. I know I don't see myself astotally male or totally female. I find that if I can let myself go, I have the freedom to meetsomewhere in the middle. And that's what I was tryingto leave behind before. I grew up in a very, you know,constricted social environment. As a Mexican American, myability to relate to women was pretty controlled. You know, they did the dishes. They cleaned the house. They had the children. They didn't talk in your company. And that's how I saw myself in white society. You know, there to do the labor. Not really viewed as a personwho could think, who could be intellectual, who could think abstractly. I can relate to that. Part of being queer for me iswalking that line between male and female and honoring that. And I am lucky enough to be able to honor that in such a way that theillusion comes outside of me rather than-- you know,some people can write it. Some people can act, you know, can paint it. I just happen to put it on. In the very beginning of the Bible, we are told that God created us in God's image, male and female. We were created in the image of God. So the image of God is bothmasculine and feminine. And that's portrayedthroughout the scriptures, though completely ignoredin most mainline churches. But what happens is that we have deified the masculine side of God and neglected the feminine side of God. And the result has been, you know, rape and abuse and the neglect of the environment and just a whole list of evils that results from the defecation of the male and the neglect of the feminine. What's resulted in humanbeings is a great brokenness, because wholeness won'tcome until we all integrate the both sides of ourselves. SHADOW MORTON: The gay and lesbian community has been having a hard time with a lot of us who are going through gender transition. In my life, I've had many ofmy women friends disappear. The general feeling is that I've copped out. I've taken the easy road out. I'm now a white male. I don't necessarily know that it's more free for male society. Because for myself, I know thatwhen I was thrown in there, there were a lot of rules. There's a lot of things that you have to do, that you have to say, andthat you have to be-- that you have to, or you don't fit in. Whereas women are a little bit more lenient. They're like, all right, girls. We're not going to do this,and we're not going to do that, and you don't have to do this, you know? Whereas the men are going,do this and that and this. And the people that I'm sexual with or that I have relationshipswith get a lot of crap, you know, discreetly fromsome of their buddies about, you know, well, how couldyou make-- you know, have sex with this person, you know? It's like, they're not really a guy, you know. That makes you straight. We live in such twisted society where everybody has to place that judgement on you before they can relate to you. See, you're either a man or a woman. And so, my come on is like, fine. You know, it's like, ifyou don't know if I'm a guy or a gal, I'll tell you what. We'll go to bed. We'll fuck. You tell me if you've beento bed with a guy or a girl. And I haven't had any problems with it or any-- it's been very clearto them once we get done. It seems like the greatesthypocrisy in the world to say that we want our sexual freedom but to proscribe who you can have sex with. I have very dear women friends,both straight and lesbian, with whom I'm very physicallyintimate, some of whom I've been sexually intimate. I have a relationship with a woman now who has been my best friend for 20 years, and we recently married. Yeah. And in between our friendships,we both had male lovers. I feel that the gay communityand the lesbian community for many years, and even in some instances today, treats bisexuality as an aberration-- not accepting, poking fun at. I mean, bisexuals are seenas dubious personalities who can't be trusted by anybody, and that's where that comes from. We may find that there area lot more bisexual people out there than we thought. But because society hasforced us to make choices historically, so many of us have chosen to say, I'm going to be this and I'vemoved away from that and this is all I am from this point forward. I always felt like who to be with would be a man and woman together. It would be perfect to be in a threesome. That was how I always sawmy perfect life would be, like that. Because I couldn't just pick one or the other. So with my last husband I could have, Kevin, who was a cross dresser. HONEY WEST: This songalways makes me feel sexy. You do too, baby. REBECCA MENZIE: I make you feel sexy? You do. It's a lesbian club, andI didn't even realize it. Sorry. We should sell tickets. [SINGING] I got a man who'salways late every time we have a date. But I love him. Yes, I love him. [trumpet whistle] Woo! One of the best things thatever happened to my comedy was that I started to get more camp. I started to have a sense of fun when I had more gay men in my life. You know, and just evil queens who would go, ah! Oh. I can't-- I cannot click with this kind of humor. I have to leave. I don't have any defense of this sort of thing. It's barbed. It's very smart-ass talk, you know, and I just don't know howto cope it, defend myself. We find a lot too, becauseof age difference now too, because of our age and our things that it's such a youth-oriented-- in the gay men, it's so youth oriented. The gay male world requires you to be aggressive and competitive, OK? And one of the ways youcompete is by verbal play, unless you are very beautiful and can just stand there and have people look at you, OK? And the more a man ages, themore he needs the verbal play to interest the young men, OK? So you get a lot thiskind of showy talk, which I love because it's very OscarWildian at gay male and in so on. Well, in the lesbian feminist world, such sharp talk is too reminiscent of the patriarchal world thatthe women are fleeing, OK? It is not esteemed, OK? On the contrary, conversationon any topic is not esteemed. You cannot get anyone to talk about anything, you know, aside from softball,OK, in a lesbian bar, OK? It drives me absolutely crazy. We're at Paris Dance, Chicago'sforemost lesbian dance club. Chicago's only lesbian dance club. From the outside, it might surprise you. You may think that it's a placeto go and get fish and chips, but it is not. Micky's is perhaps myfavorite club for two reasons. I love to dance in a relatively smoke-free environment, and it's probably the mostinterracial club that you'll find in West Hollywood. It's not all white pretty boys. Believe me, I'm not bulgingwith pecs under this jacket. I was just telling them howWest Hollywood is becoming more multiracial with lots of shapes and sizes and all sorts of different people, because that hasn't always been the case. As a person of color, have you felt embraced in West Hollywood? It's mostly-- I still feel likeit's a lot of white gay men. And the men don't necessarilytreat the women equal. It's kind of a gay men's town,not so much a gay community. There's no question thatsociety and civilization is different for women and men and that lesbians experience more difficultyeconomically and with regard to opportunity. There's also, you know, aprivilege of how one looks. And those of us that are more stereotypically identified as lesbians becomemore subjected to, I think, hate assaults and a varietyof forms of discrimination. I don't I think I'm a victim,and I'm nobody's victim. And I don't think any lesbian or gay man is. I think that we have had wrongs that have certainly occurred to us. But the minute that we jump into a situation where we are just admitting victimhood, we are letting people control us. I want a place at the table. I want every single thingthat a straight white male has in this society, and I'm going to go out there and get it. And if government is going to help me, fine. If they're not going to help me, fine. I don't want to be a part of movement that once the sexualorientation issue is answered will leave me here, you know,to fend for myself as an African American and as a woman. Sometimes there's a sensewith gay men, primarily just because they're men and whatthat means in this society, that there's sort of the senseof, I don't have any wants. I'm fine. I've even heard them say, I don't have to worry about gay rights. I have everything I need. Interesting. I'm glad that you feel that comfortable, but there's a lot of us whoare not in that position. Or a lot of rich gay whitemen who say that but then find out that they can be equally discriminated against or murdered or beaten. Purely why? Because they're gay. CECE COX: There's a sayingnow that's going around, "Friday night football,Saturday night queer bashing." And part of what figures into that is that gay men are seen as easy targets. They are supposed to have more money than other groups in society. And they're not going to fightback as much, because they're going to be sissies. In college, I was doing a playabout homosexuality and AIDS. People were so upset that I had to have police protection 24 hours a day, because I was having life threats. And a friend of mine got his house burned down. I have heard that he is involved in the occult and Satanism, andI have heard that from students who personally know Brad. BRAD EVANS: I didn't set it myself. I don't care enough about thisplay to destroy everything I own and the two cats that-- REPORTER: I'm sorry. REP. JEAN DIXON: I want to see them. These were my cats. They were found in the bedroom. They died of smoke inhalation. They were not sacrificed. OK. And I am not a Satan worshipper. REP. JEAN DIXON: I didn'taccuse you of that, Brad. The paper totally misquoted me. I would absolutely have no part in this kind of statement whatsoever, OK? I want you to know that. We are tolerant of thehomosexual, of that person. But we are totallyintolerable of the lifestyle and of the homosexual act of sodomy. I do think there is somelevel to which people are more violently angry about gay men than they are violently angry about lesbians. I also think that lesbians comewith much better coping skills from having experiencedmisogyny from time of birth to deal with these things. Women are less likely toidentify anti-lesbian assaults as being anti-lesbian. I remember talking to awoman one day who was talking about a lesbian who was raped on campus because she was a lesbian. It was a hate crime. But it wasn't marked as a hate crime. It was only marked as a rape. And it's not just a rape, andit's not just a hate crime. It's both. She was raped because she was a lesbian. And so those sort of issues get lost, and they don't get dealt with in a full matter. Somebody's-- you know, it'snot being included under hate crimes that are going on on campus, or people aren't aware that there was homophobia involved in thefact that this woman was raped. Or people look at thehomophobia and don't recognize that the particular actionthat was taken against her was taken against her because she was female, and it wouldn't have beentaken against a male. Gay bashers don't see the difference. It's like, you're all faggots. You're all queers. You're all dykes. You're all disgusting, and you deserve to die. PROTESTER: It's not a lifestyle. According to the scriptures,there's no foundation for this. It's perversion. It's a beast spirit. I got two kids, and we neverhad a queer rally before. And we're not queers. We don't want them in our town. God will burn this town down if it gets full of gays, full of queers. He'll burn it to the ground. And he's going to burn our nation if we don't straighten up. You have to come back and say no. Homosexuality, including explicitly homosexual sexual conduct-- you always have to say that to those people-- is not only not immoral orsinful or wrong or undesirable but is affirmatively moral and virtuous and right and desirable. And that is a moral absolute. And our moral absolutes arejust as absolute as yours, and yours are no more absolute than ours. The matter is not on thetable even for discussion. If the right wing is angry at us and denying us our civilrights because they're so upset about anal intercourse and disgusting promiscuous gay men, then fine. Let's call their bluff. Let's have a lesbian-onlycivil rights bill. I certainly think that the majority of people you find leadingthese anti-gay crusades are men. I don't think that's an accident, and I don't think it'smerely reflective of the fact that society continues to be run mostly by men. I think that men arethreatened by specifically gay male sexuality in a way that they simply aren't by lesbian sexuality. J. CRAIG FONG: To be crude about it, I think there's even a level inwhich men think about these two women, and even if theywere to think "lesbians," many men harbor this fantasy of being able to sort of get involved somehow with this. There's that fantasy aboutmen and two women, you know. But two men immediately violatesthat man's sense of security and that sense of well-being that men are accustomed to having because they're men. The basis of homophobia is sexism. And men are terrified of weakness, and they're terrified of being penetrated or being seen as people who can be penetrated. I think, frankly, thatstraight men are sometimes jealous of gay men becauseof the ready availability of casual sex. Because that is somethingthat the male libido lends itself to. MICHELANGELO SIGNORILE: AndI think it plays out a lot of times in the repression. It's almost like, well, if we can't do it, then you're not going to do it. We all want to do it too. We have the same urges in us. But we can't do it, becausewomen won't allow us to do it. Heterosexual men have to take women into account, if you like, right? Because that's who they want to have sex with. I mean, that's who theywant to have as partners. So their masculinity, if youlike, is modified by the fact that they have to enterinto this social involvement with women. Whereas with gay men, ofcourse, that's not a factor. They're interacting with other men. So in that sense, of course, gay men can take masculinity to the limit. CAMILLE PAGLIA: Women have always been allowed a kind of physicalintimacy with other women. This is a direct result of the fact that the burden of reproductionfalls on the women. So from the moment the baby is born, the baby is cradled and coddled and other women in the tribes nurse thepregnant woman and so on. So there's a kind of touchy-feely quality, a tactility, a tactile sensuality that's permitted to womenthat is not permitted to men. We probably have thesame myths and stereotypes that straight guys have orthat heterosexual society have about women. But, you know, it's like,well, what do they do? And "who cares?" is sort of an attitude that I find among many gay men. Well, what do they do? I don't know. Well, let's not even talk about it, you know? Because I think that gay men feel somewhat superior in terms of their sex lives to lesbian women. I think that's real clear. Real clear to me. Yeah, I visited with apolice chief and a number of other gay and lesbian leaders when there was a crackdown on sex in the parks, and they arrested a lot of gay men. They announced that gay menwere going to be arrested if they had sex in the park.OK. So we're all sitting here, and I'm wondering what I'm doing here. Because I don't thinkthat's a great idea for men to have sex in the park. I think that's wrong. It's the self-gratificationof homosexual men. And couldn't you at least keepit in the bedroom or something? And then, of course, you alsodeal with the whole other issue of AIDS, in which one of thesurveys out of San Francisco says that one third of the men surveyed were participating in unsafe sex, and AIDS is resurging again. One of the greatest bridgesbetween gay men and lesbians has been the lesbian response to AIDS. It has been the factthat-- I think periodically there's some lip service paid. But I think when the history is written that gay men and America are going to owe a phenomenal debt tothe lesbian response to AIDS. BARNEY FRANK: Of all the groups in America, lesbians have probably beenthe least vulnerable to AIDS. After all, AIDS does gettransmitted in an active way by male sex organs. Lesbians have the least contact on the whole with male sex organs. And despite that, thelesbian community was superb. GROUP: [SINGING] --never know,dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away. Oh, right. Perfect. Perfect. Now, lesbians like gay men, because they have men where they want them. They have men laid out, passive beneath them, so they can be the usual,oppressive, condescending, you know, paternalistic caregivers, all right, dominating gay men. Suddenly, the men who were--the gay men who were all powerful are suddenlythe weak, diseased person who needs to be taken care of by the strong woman. And in that sense, maybe lesbians do like that on some level. HAL CALL: Another reason for the power of lesbians in the last fewyears in our publications and performing arts and books,theater-- AIDS has taken the cream of the crop of young male leadership that would be now in their 30s to mid-50s. AIDS has taken that leadership away. What that does is, in a co-ed community, it allows for someone like myself to be able to have a kindof visibility or platform for my voice that, historically,the sexism of gay men would not have allowed for. So you could argue with some truth-- and if you want to be a complex thinker, you have to admit thesetruths-- that there has been some material equity that's been able to be achieved because of the mass death. That there's been a mitigator. But that, you know-- it'supsetting to say those things, but they're part of the truth. The reality is that lesbiansrallied to the AIDS crisis to support and care for our gay brothers. That's why we did it. Certainly, we've gotten into other aspects of the AIDS crisis, but that'sreally where we started. And there's hardly a lesbian Iknow that hasn't given money, given time, given energy, mademeals, taken care of, nursed, been at the deathbed of a gay man. There's sort of a burnoutand backlash kind of thing happening around it where it'sunderstood that we, no matter how radical we thought we were being, we were really fulfillingreally very traditional roles. Hmm. Well, lesbians are women. And part of the legacy of sexismhas been women as caretakers, women as nurturers. It's also, I think, our greatest strength. I've encountered some very courageous, giving, sacrificing men in thecontext of the AIDS epidemic. In my whole life, I've neverencountered such caring and love and all of the kindsof things that normally get attributed to women. But they do that for each other. I don't oftentimes see men caring for women in the same waythat women care for men. I think maybe more and more we're getting the idea to save some of that energy for ourselves and for our issues. Many lesbians have gaybrothers, uncles, nephews. And to just simply say thatwe as a lesbian community don't need to be bothered by that means they don't understandthat their sisters are very much related andthat our communities are not polarized. Well, if AIDS had hit the women's community, the only way gay men wouldknow about it is if they were tripping over our dead bodies. And I truly believe that. ANN NORTHROP: ACT UP and AIDS activism came about because affluentgay white men thought they had power and were shockedto find out that they did not, were absolutely astonished. And it's only because theyalready felt so empowered, felt that they were entitledto everything on the face of the earth, that they got so angry and went out in the streets. CATHERINE SAALFIELD: And the men had said, we're here to get drugs thatwill help us into our bodies. And it was veryshortsighted in that sense, because none of thosedrugs were tested on women, and they weren't tested on IV drug users. So some of the women were saying, you've got to put a focus on these and make demands around these issues as well. And they were saying, that'stoo far off our track. Different studies are beginning to establish that a lot of lesbians and bisexual women are having sex with gay and bisexual men. And as a result, they're beginning to share the impact of the epidemic. Lesbians are getting infected. Right now, it looks like throughsex with men and IV drug use. So those are some of the concerns that this community has to address. The lesbian particularly has to talk about drugs. ELISABETH NONAS: And there have been studies about female-to-female transmission of AIDS, and there are studies thatsay, oh, it can't happen. And then there are lesbianswho say, no, excuse me, it's happened to me. I don't know what the verdict is. But it's not just AIDS. I mean, there are a wholelot of other things. You know, I think that at thesame time that we're talking about AIDS, we should bealso talking about, you know, breast cancer and other thingsthat strike lesbians and get men to realize that, you know, our sisters have been taking care of us all this time. You know, we need to, you know, turn around and take care of them too. JEFF YARBROUGH: Janis Ian'sone of our regular columnists, and she wrote a column about breast cancer and about her personalexperiences with a mammogram. And it's the first time Isort of experienced the fear that some of my women friends gothrough at these examinations. So we got this letter from a male reader that said, "You've just lost a subscriber. Who cares about Janis Ian's tits?" Gay men are not rallying to the support of women on any level the way lesbians have responded to the AIDS crisis. I don't think that if I pled my case and talked about what it'slike living with breast cancer that they would put me downor disregard me or anything. I just think that then they walk away, and it doesn't-- it's not gotto do with their life, you know? And that that is-- it's hard on all of us. If I was a woman and fiveyears ago had had breast cancer and had survived five years, I would be called a breast cancer survivor. I've been HIV positive 16 or 17 years, and I'm still called terminally ill. And if the brain is beingassaulted with death sentence, terminal illness, you know, bythe media, by the government, by activists, just constantly,the body will respond in kind. JOAN NESTLE: I don'tthink that we have any way to emotionally find a language for what AIDS is doing to our communities. And there's no anger as deep as the belief that someone doesn'tunderstand your own tears. And I think that's-- we're both filled with tears. [carillon playing] PRIEST: This morning, we have the great joy of baptizing a new baby into the family of God. We have done that a lot lately, and we're going to do it a whole lotmore, I see in the future, if the pregnant women walkingaround here are any signs. [laughter] Sydney Michelle, I baptizeyou in the name of the God who created you, the Christwho is your Redeemer, and the Holy Spirit who will sustain you. Sisters and brothers of the family of God, will you love this child and care for this child and pray for this child? If as the people of Godyou are willing to do that, will you say "we will"? CONGREGATION: We will. PRIEST: Amen. Welcome into God's family thischild, whom we bless this day. [applause] The baby boom is verykind of an interesting way that men and women are gettingtogether, that lesbians who I remember as separatists who didn't like children when they were children now are, you know, wanting to have children. And they are parenting,co-parenting with gay men and having these conversations. Whether, you know, it works out or not, whether the guys actually dobecome the sperm donors or not, it's really an interestingdialogue that's happening. I actually think there was a sort of a time period of courting one another and getting to know each other. Going out, you know, findingout who are these people and what are they like. And it was very differentfor me, because I really had not had many gay male friends. JEFFREY LOCKMAN: And it sohappened that we were all out of town when it was time to do an insemination, and we did it the old fashionedway, without any high tech. I mean-- Well, not the real old fashioned way. We used a syringe.We used a syringe or whatever. We used a syringe. Right. In terms of custody, one ofthe things that we're seeing now are fights between lesbiansand gay male sperm donors. I mean, one of the argumentsin some of these cases is, I have a lot of money, and if I'm recognized as the father, then Iwill put this child in my will. And if I'm not recognized asthe father, I won't do that. We have a legal arrangementand a legal document that we all signed sayingthat all three of us should be considered parents of Benjamin. You know, whether that wouldbe recognized in a court of law is one issue, but we wanted that document in order to show our intent. As our attorney said, we wantto bend over backwards to keep this from ever being litigated. Both gay men and lesbiansbenefit from equal rights in the workplace, marriage rights, adoption, anything affectingrelationships and civil rights. Those are the things we can agree on. We don't have to agree on anything else. And I think we also haveto recognize those things, those differences as well, andnot be afraid to address them and be very blunt about them. Because otherwise, they show up as fury. They show up as, why are wespending so much time on AIDS? You know, what about breast cancer? When really what we mean is, we need you there on these issues too. Gay men and lesbians needeach other as a political force if nothing else. We need each other for numbers if nothing else. And I think in many ways we have a lot that we can give to each other. I think that the big challenge for gay men is to try to learn from lesbians about interpersonal relationships. Even in our partnerships,we tend to stop having sex after a couple of years. And so it's one of the things that I think is a wonderful thing that wecan learn from our brothers, is that is how to keep sex exciting, alive, interesting, fun. I certainly have learned from my gay men friends about laughing and dishing,and I think that gay men have learned to take themselves a little more seriously because of lesbians. It's a nice cross-pollination. But what I'm really looking forward to is this generation that'scoming up right now. Because I think that, you know,if we're talking about a pride divide here, I think they'rethe ones who are really going to bridge it and heal it. [music playing] [rock song playing]
