'The best way to eat natto fermented beans. 'You need good beans... 'and to do it right. 'First you take your chopsticks... '... and you mash 'em up good' What are you doing, Norimichi? What? It's a school day. You'll be late. I know. I'm going right now. - Hey, that's cold! - Get going! School the day of the fireworks show! Why? I've got it worse. Why? What time is school over? About noon. We're out this afternoon. The PTA? They're holding a bazaar. Today? Where? Community center. Who'll come on a day like this? Yeah! I'm going! 'Bye! 'Bye! You don't... ...want to come? But Mother, I just can't stand it any more. Yes, I know that... yes... Nazuna! Give this to Miss Miura. What is it? What's this letter? Good morning! Hey! Stop that! Don't do that! Tits! She'll kill you! Hey! Good morning. Good morning. Norimichi. It's OK if I tell Nazuna I like her? I said you could! A million years ago! You've got to help me fix up a chance! Are you going? To the fireworks? Bang! Ow! You bastard! Fireworks are for kids! And you're not a kid? You don't have a dick yet! No dick! Nice! Sorry. And now... Isn't it pretty? The color it burns changes with the element. Sodium, copper, barium... ...each burns with a certain color. This is called... Flame reaction! Very good! Flame reaction This flame reaction is also used in fireworks. So do you know why fireworks give different colors? Yes! Today is the lioka Fireworks Display. I'm sure you're all going, so remember this. Red is strontium, green is copper, and yellow is sodium. It'll be more fun to watch knowing that... 'The lioka Fireworks Display will be on the evening of August 1. 'Please keep the following in mind.' There will be lots of people there, so I want you all to be careful... ...to stay away from strange people who might ask you to go with them. Read this, and enjoy the fireworks. Miss... Do we have to read it if we're not going? Aren't you going? I don't know. There's a soccer game on TV. Read it anyway. Miss... Here. 'Bye! Bye-bye! A love letter, Miss Miura? Are you on pool cleaning, too? Are you finished? No... We were just cooling off first. I see. A divorce... and she's going with her mother. She wants Nazuna to change schools this month. Which means that after summer break she'll be gone. What do I tell the other kids? Well, not the truth, anyway. That's a can of worms we don't want to open up. Who'd send a child to school with a letter like this! What are you doing? Nothing. There's an ant on you. Take it off. Take it off. Thanks. Hey, Norimichi! I'll race you 50 meters! You pissed yourself or something? Hey Nazuna! Start us, will you? What's with her? Her period? What are we betting? My newest Slam Dunk. I've already read it. The next one, then. You promise? Yeah! What if I win? If you win I will... ...tell Nazunal like her. Wait a minute! That's not fair! Don't be so serious! It's just a game! You don't want me to get Nazuna. Tell her anyway! Win or lose! Can I be the starter? 50 meters? Tell her! Is this a bet? Let's go! What? Come on! What is this? All right... on your marks... ...get set... go! What are you doing?! Yusuke... Are you going to the fireworks tonight? Huh? Go with me. Why? Because I like you. You... what? I'll come to your place at 5. Be there, OK? Ouch! That doesn't count. I smashed my foot! Round! Flat! They are round! From any direction! Look... Usually they look like this... Hey! Are fireworks round if you see them from the side? Or are they flat? Fireworks? What is this? You know, the big ones. They're flat aren't they? There! Listen to me! Yusuke? Round. Why? I don't know. So listen while I explain! Have you seen Nazuna? She went home. No way, you are wrong. Give me a reason. Who thinks they're flat? Me! You just said round! That was then. This is now. Have you ever seen flat fireworks? Like a disc? I have! There! See? You can't believe Minoru! It's true! I saw the fireworks from my Grandpa's place last year. From his garden they went out like this. He said from here the angle's wrong. His Grandpa said so! OK, let's bet on it. Bet what? My newest Slam Dunk I've already got it. Me too. What, then? All our summer homework! Great! And if I win? A ticket to a soccer game. You don't have one! Can I ask something? How do you see fireworks go off from the side? A helicopter? That's easy. The lighthouse is right by the water. So we can climb up to the same level as the fireworks. So who'll go? I will! Me too! Come on, you guys! It'll be fun! Easier than summer homework! Norimichi? I don't know... Come on! You're one of us, aren't you? Come on! Come on! What do I get if I win? Come on! Come on! 5 o'clock at the schoolyard, ok? 5. Don't be late. Isn't he kinda weird today? He's always weird. Thought you weiredo. Oh yeah? And what about you?! Shimada Fishing Tackle Closed Today 'I'm back! ' 'Hi! ' 'I'm back! ' 'Hi! ' 'I'm back! '...Whoa! What are you doing in here? Your back door was unlocked. You should be more careful. Well, we don't expect people to come wandering in. I said 'anyone home? ' and then I came in. Anyway, you're free till 5, aren't you? Strange enough, so am I. That's been there for days! Not the Wave Punch! Take that. Tornado Punch! We should go. Is it that late already? It's five. Tornado Punch! Sorry! What's all that for? You're not bringing anything? We'll be late! This way we'll be right on time! Ow! What's wrong? I hurt my foot in the pool today. Today? I banged it. You did? You were there! Azumi Clinic Um... ...is Yusuke here? Yusuke? I haven't seen him today. Maybe he went to the fireworks. That looks bad. Ow! Sorry. It's nothing. No, it's not! You might get tetanus. What's tetanus. Germs. If you wait too long, they spread through your whole body and you die. You do not! You do! I'm not kidding! Get my dad to look at it. I'll tell the others. Get going. You come with me. If we do that, the others won't know what's going on. Tell the nurse I said to come. Just say you're my friend and he'll see you right away. Oh, yeah... ...if Nazuna's there, tell her I can't go. Can't go where? She'll understand. Did you tell her? No, I didn't. She asked me! When? Today. What did she say? Nazuna... Well... 'let's go to the fireworks.' Why aren't you going? It's not fair to the guys. What's wrong with it? Go with her! No way! It looks bad. What? Don't you like Nazuna? Who, me? I was just kidding. You didn't think I was serious, did you? Man, you're an idiot! Who'd like a scrag like that? Hurry or your tetanus'll get worse. Where have you been? Where's Norimichi? He's going to be a bit late. Excuse me... Excuse me... I'm a friend of Yusuke's... Can you see? You can't see anything from here. Why do you put stalls here where you can't see anything? Huh? It's too crowded down on the beach to drink in comfort. So here is just for people in the know... Norimichi sure is late... Are we going? Not yet. You kids have some oden, too. When you see fireworks from the side, are they round or flat? What's this? A game? Yusuke said tetanus? He's got a big mouth. So I'm OK? Well, if you leave a cut like that... ...it could get infected. The receptionist will call your name. Um... ...Yusuke's not coming, you know. Oh. What did I tell you! That's not true, is it? What's going on? Fireworks are flat! No! This gentleman may look ordinary, but he is a fireworks-maker. Hey Kazuhiro! All our homework! No way! We haven't seen it yet. We've got to see it ourselves! Stick it, man! A bet's a bet, and you lost. You do our homework! Shit! Are we still going? Why? We already know the answer. Let's go to the beach, then. Yeah! What about Norimichi? Let's wait a while. He's at your place. Why don't you go get him? Yeah, we'll go on ahead. You catch up with us. Hey... who's a fireworks-maker? Huh? Who? Not me... If I'd asked you, would you have taken off on me, too? I suddenly decided to ask whoever won the race. It was the crawl. I thought you'd win. So I bet on the winner. If I'd asked you, would you have betrayed me, too? Forget it. I guess betrayal runs in my family. I... I wouldn't have betrayed you. I wonder... Yes, you would. Stop it! Let go of me! Stop it! Let go! Let go! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No! Norimichi! Stop it! No! Norimichi! What was that? Norimichi! Come here! What was she doing here? You saw her! Don't look! Are you OK? Norimichi! Why'd you hit him? What's wrong? If I'd only won that race... If I'd won... If I'd won... 50 meters? Is this a bet? Let's go! What? Come on! What is it? On your marks... Get set... Go! Norimichi! Are you going to the fireworks tonight? Go with me. Why? Why not? I'll come to your place at 5. Be there, OK? Hey, do you know where Nazuna is? Hey, do you know where Nazuna is? She just left. The lioka Lighthouse is right by the shore. That means you can see the fireworks from the side. Yeah, you could! Let's go! Right! Let's go! Norimichi? Huh? What? What do you mean "what?". Are you listening? See you at five. See you at five. Hey, you're home. You're trespassing, you know that? Nazuna? It's Norimichi. Look, something's come up. It's nothing really important... I promised Yusuke and the guys. It's a guy's promise. I can't break it... Shit! What do I do?! You got the runs? No, just a piss. It's time to go. Already? Just a little longer... I'll go get some juice. Let's forget about the lighthouse. So what if fireworks are round or flat? Who cares? We'll just get tired going there. Let's blow them off and go to the beach. We can't do that! Sure we can. OK, you go and tell them. You go to Yuichi and the others and say we're sorry but we're not coming. OK. They can't complain if we do that. Nope. Just a minute... Let me play this a bit more... get me a drink, too. What's wrong? Yusuke's here. So you can't come? No, I can come... just wait here a minute. Norimichi! Maybe we should go. What?! It's not nice. Not nice? What's wrong with it? I'm coming down. Norimichi. Let's go! Shouldn't you lock this door? Was that... ...Nazuna? What the hell?! Shit! He saw us! That was funny! Hey, what's in this thing? Oh, no! It came open! Are you going on a trip? A trip? Where? A bus! No, sorry... I'm getting on. Hey! Where are you going? Did you have a fight? No, we didn't! Then why didn't he come? I don't know! Hey kid! Your net's dissolved. Yusuke, come on! Hey, you! Thanks, Mister. Yusuke, come on! Hey, Kazuhiro! Are we going already? The fireworks will be over. Don't forget you said you'd help me. What? Are you going? Thanks a lot! Have some more! Hey, what was it? Fireworks from the side? What was it? What about the fireworks? You want to see them? Don't you? Do you, Norimichi? Where are we going? Where should we go? Anywhere you like. Tokyo? Osaka? Are you... ...running away from home? You are, aren't you. Why? It's not 'running away'. It's 'eloping'. 'EIoping'? That's what this is called. Are we going to kill ourselves? That's a love-suicide, stupid! Let's stop for a bit. Hey! No stopping! We'd've been able to see them if we'd gone around the shore. Who said this was the shortest way? By distance it is. Who asked me the shortest way by distance? Get up! Relax! Who wants a banana? Me! What's that? Why did you bring all that stuff? Were you bringing it to sell? We have to walk over there? It's too far! Whose idea was this, anyway? Someone who said fireworks are round. No, someone who said they were flat! Watch it! Cut it out! You watch it! I'm a year older than you! Shut up, four-eyes! Shut up, dog-year! 30 more minutes. I'm going to the washroom. Come with me. Bring that, too. A girl can get work anywhere. I'll just tell them I'm 16. You don't look 16. No? No. There are 16 year-olds who look like me. Where will you work? I'll work at night somewhere... I'll support us. Don't worry. Well? Now do I look 16? We need tickets! What about the tickets? Tickets? What tickets? The train tickets... The train? What about a train? You know, 'the train'... What train? What are you talking about? Here's the bus. Let's go home. Hey, what's going on? I love Oikawa Nazuna! I love Oikawa Nazuna! Miss Miura! Miss Haruko Miura! Haruko! Haruko! Mizuki Arisa! (Japanese actress) We're like thieves. That'd be cool! Maybe I'll be a thief. What should we steal? All this water? Look! It's like Indian ink! Watch your voice! It's kind of scary. Hey! Hey! Hey! Nazuna! Hey! Don't do things like that! Nazuna! Mizuki Arisa! Sailor Moon! She's a manga character! What's the difference? Sailor Moon! Nazuna! Haruko! Mizuki Arisa! I wonder if fireworks are flat when you see them from the side... I guess I'll see you next term. That'll be fun. Where's the fireworks? They're over. Miss Miura. Shimada! What are you doing here so late? You'd better get home. Who's this, Haruko? A student? Is that your boyfriend? Huh? Who? Oh, yeah... Miss, are fireworks flat if you see them from the side, or round? Flat, aren't they? Don't be stupid! They're round! What are you teaching these kids? What do you mean? They're flat! It's like dynamite. The force is equal in all directions. They're like this... This is the front... ...This is the side. From here they'd be flat, wouldn't they? What did we come here for? What do you mean? This is all your fault! Shut up, dog-year! Shimada! What? Just come here... Ow! Oh, sorry! Yasu, the fireworks man. Hello. We were in school together, if you can believe that. Shut up, Makoto! Fireworks are flat whether you see them... ...from the side or from below. Right? The best place to see them is from below. That's the best seat. So let's send one up and see if it's flat or round. This one's left over. It might not be all that great. He's doing this especially for you, Shimada. This is in honor of... ...Makoto's and Miss Miura's wedding!
