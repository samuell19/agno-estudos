This is not a modern book. This is a testimony for love. And this? Yet the child who slept with this... grow up to shake the world. Tell me about this, Captain Manzini. An early form of air conditioning. Also a tool of romance. It could beckon or rebuff. Did you ever get beckoned Yes. I also got rebuffed. But, like me, this is a relic from a simpler age. good and bad, black and white. When a man could set all his differences with one of these. Then some damn fool invented gun powder and a bigger damn fool split the atom. That's when I decided to leave mankind to it's folly. and retire here into the world of memories. - Touch'e! - Dodger, no! - Have you ever heard of Pandora's box? - Never heard of Pandora. Right.
