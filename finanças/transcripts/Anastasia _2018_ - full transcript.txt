Once, the Romanovs ruled all of Russia. For 300 years, the dynasty reigned, from the first family to the last. When the revolution came, so too the change, and the Romanov name was seen as a threat. But another name would rise... the name of a young girl that would become legend. Though no one can say for sure what happened to her, many timeless tales suggest it's more than it seems. For where there lives hope... there will always live dreams. The festivities are beginning, Anastasia. What are you doing all the way out here? Something doesn't feel right, Rasputin. Another ball, another party. It's just the butterflies... from all these... guests. It's more than that. It's the people. I wish everyone could come, all of Russia. One day, when you rule, they will. I can see it. It's part of your... magic. And our plan is still in place for the ball? It is. Now, let's go find your family. The ball's about to begin. Good evening, Tsar Nicholas. Wonderful night for a gathering. Thank you. Please, enjoy the party. - Hm. - Tsar Nicholas. May I have a moment? Of course. Thank you for... always being there for her. Often I think you may be her only friend. It's just the age. I know it well. It was the age when your family found me and brought a homeless boy in. Ah... Now, Your Majesty, I have been researching trade routes on how we can improve the resources for the people. Always working, my friend. I have something for you. Hm. Oh, I cannot accept this. Ah... but you must. It is one of many advantages of being Tsar. You are now Grigori Rasputin, Grand Protector of Russia. - Thank you. - Hm. Then as Grand Protector, I must advise you to entertain Lenin tonight. Just with a close eye. Prosperity brings peace, and Lenin rises with the people. It'll be a gesture of goodwill. Lenin is opportunist and is not to be trusted. He'll go to unthinkable lengths to achieve his goals. I have already informed him that he is not allowed on this premises, on this night, nor any other. Do not worry, Rasputin. We must always stand for what is right, no matter the times. In you, Russia trusts, as do I. I seek your counsel. This choice is not easy. The correct choices never are. The heart of Russia grows cold, Lenin. But a new Russia needs you if it is to rise. The people, your people, they starve... while their extravagances thrive. But what is needed, I just cannot... It's one family... or an entire nation. The people look to you to lead. If the Tsar does not respect this, you must show your strength... and never look back. Once done... it shall be done. Russia cannot continue under this rule of the Tsar. The people starve, our resources and power weaken by the day. Let me lead you to rise against Nicholas and restore our impoverished nation back to prominence. For the people, I plead to you. The Tsar Nicholas has decreed that you shall not be allowed... to be on the premises this evening. This is the final order... the order of the Tsar. You see, elitism! Royalty! They mock us as commoners. They mock the very essence of our country! Mark my words when I say this, this will be their great downfall. Their lavish balls, their imperial costumes, their feast and arts... I vow to end this dynasty from ruling our Russia, once and for all! Father, the ball has begun. Anya, you can't be here. It's very dangerous. It's OK. We do it for her. We do it for the children of Russia. That's who we fight for, the children of Russia, for new Russia. Are you with me, comrades?! Then hold your vodka up high. For peace, land, and power! Miss, please don't let them start a conversation. Last time, we spent the whole night. Just remember, you can always use a dance with me as an out. Oh, my hero. Ah, a conversation I will enjoy. A pleasure to see you again. As always, Russia is extremely appreciative of the alliance between our two countries. As is China. We are honored by your invite. No doubt we will have many a moment to discuss our continued friendship. Still no princess, I see. Well, I look forward to the day. There are plenty here, you know. Fighting I seem to have mastered. Dance partners, on the other hand... Well, I do trust your journey here was grand? Grand, like all adventures are. My beautiful children. How did we get so lucky? It is not luck. How do I look, Father? Ah... dashing, like the princes in your storybook. And just as brave! - Is it ready? - Of course. I made you a promise, and I intend to keep it. But first, what about him? I made your father a promise that I'd find you a prince. Him? Gross. Well, I tried. But now... And this year, we have a special guest! We welcome the orphans. I have a feeling that was your daughter.

You have got to be kidding me. Why, yes, I'd love to dance. Right... Tsar Nicholas, I must speak to you. I had a vision. It's Lenin. No. Not on this night, Rasputin. Lenin is at bay. The guards are at the gates. Just enjoy the festivities, my old friend. I'm here for my meeting with the Tsar! Come! Hurry! Come. Go. Hurry! Listen... stay, stay. Where is the Tsar?! No sign of the royal family. The guards have searched everywhere. There are places in the palace, places unseen. But where? There. Is it ready? Lenin will soon know of our whereabouts. The link is nearly complete. We must move, Rasputin, now! It is ready. The children first. Are we going to be OK? Always. Take this, it will bring you magic when you need it. Blue will tell you who to trust, and red will tell you who to fear. And what will be of you? I'll find you with this. Now go, Anastasia, go! Go, Anastasia. Be strong. Papa, are you coming? Alexei, you must be brave, like in the storybooks. Now go. Papa... - Papa! - Anastasia! No, Papa! Seize him! Tell me what you did with her. Never. So long as the blood of a Romanov lives, so, too, does the heart of Russia. So be it. ♪ Read this song ♪ ♪ Of days long gone ♪ ♪ Darkened spirits ♪ ♪ take and roam ♪ ♪ Souls untwine ♪ ♪ Rise as mine ♪ ♪ Time before ♪ ♪ And time after ♪ ♪ Time ♪ Now he is ours.

She invited me because you're her mom's boss. We've talked about that, Megan. It's not a... I swear... so many deer this time of year. Yeah... deer. - OK. - Thanks, Mom. - Of course. - So coulda walked. - But thanks anyway. - Call me if you need anything, OK? You got it. I love you. - Love you too. - Bye. Have fun. - Megan! - Happy birthday, Beatrice. Thank you so much. I'm super glad you made it. Me too. You know, I've just been adding gifts to the table but since you're right here, I'll just go ahead and open yours. Oh, no, you don't have to do that. - Just put it on the table. - I insist. It is my birthday, after all. Right. Anything for your birthday, Beatrice. I love it! It's perfect. Thank you for coming. Yeah. Thanks for, like, inviting me. Megan! I'm so glad you could make it. Thanks for coming. Let's get your skates. Here, let me take that. I'll put it with the others. - Oh, thanks. - You're very welcome, and please tell your mother I said hello. Will do. Size five, please. Size five. Seriously? What is this? I told my mom not to make me invite her. Come on, let's get to the good gifts. No good book should ever go to waste. Wasn't a hit, huh? Yeah, well, Beatrice is kind of an idiot, so... Someone smart should enjoy it. Wait... I can't let a fellow book-lover leave empty-handed. Store policy. Pick out any book you'd like. It's on the house tonight. - Any book? - Any. Thanks. The Bride of Frankenstein. You're home early. Yeah, you were supposed to call. What happened? Party ended early. I had a great time though. Really tired. I think I'm gonna head to bed. OK. Hope you had fun. Huh? You sure everything's OK? Yeah, Mom. I promise. The party was great. Trust me. OK. I just wanted to check in. Thanks, Mom. You bet. "The History of the Romanovs." I know you're there. Come out. I knew it was you... the girl from the road. Why are you following me? And why are you dressed like that? It's OK. It's actually a cool dress. It's just, you know, different. You're safe here. I won't tell anyone if you ran away. I've thought about doing it too. The whole "no friends, weird parents" thing. Totally get it. If you need a roof, you can stay there for the night. The Millers are trying to sell it, so... it's empty. Well... come on. Here, hold this. It's just a flashlight. You know, to help you see in the dark. A flashlight? Wow. Where again did you run away from? I come here sometimes just to get away. Just make sure you keep the lights low. It draws attention. It's a lot more comfortable than it looks. Gotta go. I'll check on you in the morning, OK? What's your name, anyhow? - Annie. - Oh. It's nice to meet you, Annie. I'm Megan. OK, OK. I'm up. Did... did you do this? Yes. You don't like? Like? I love. This definitely brings value to the neighborhood. But... the Millers are gonna be really mad if they drive by and see it... with us. So... Why don't we get out of here? But after I change. Welcome to my room. I have to change, but it'll only be a sec. It's a perk of being 12. Make yourself at home though. Everything OK out there? I know you're new here and stuff, but if you're planning on sticking around, there's this really cool Halloween party that everyone goes to. Ready to roll? "Madison." What? You act like you've never been to a playground before. A playground? Yeah. A playground. You know, grounds where you play? The swings are my favorite. They always make me feel like I'm flying. Come on. What are you waiting for? It's safe. It's just old. I come here all the time. I don't understand. It's all in the feet. And, well, remembering to hold on. You got it. OK, the higher you are, the more fun it is. OK, so at the highest point, we fly. Ready? One... two... three! I like playgrounds. Yeah, they're pretty great. Um, who are you? And isn't Halloween next weekend? Come on, Beatrice, leave her alone. Must have got it from the same place you got that stupid book. Yeah, go back to your hole, Megan. Let's get outta here. How... how did you do that? Russian trick. Well, whatever it was, it awesome! Awe-some. What is this awesome? It means... well... How 'bout I just show you? Besides, we've really gotta do something about that dress. Where to? Mall-leh? - What? - Mall-leh-leh? Oh, the mall? The mall. Choose your words, pal. Ain't but a few miles away. And this baby's got plenty of horsepower. Where are the horses? Come on in. You look like a weird, old, creepy man. Now, honey, you know I said not to talk to strangers, OK? It's just a movie on a TV. You know, Back to the Future. Uh... a TV? Yeah, like the one at the Miller's house. Except this one is on... and really loud. It works by... Actually, I don't know how it works. But it's really cool. Come on. We've got a Bliss album to listen to. Why are you listening to Bliss on that right now?

Yeah, thanks for being so, you know... Awesome. If you're ever in California, look me up. We will. Right, Annie? I've always wanted to go to California. Ha! Sir! That's really not appropriate You need to leave. So... Annie, that's a pretty name. Thank you. It doesn't sound very Russian though. Is it Russian? I knew immediately where you were from because of your accent. I am fascinated by Russian history. Catherine the Great, Ivan the Terrible, the Romanovs... Do you still have family there? - Yes. - Well, it's a different world. Here you go, honey. Oh, my... Well, I would love to meet your parents. Maybe next time we can all have dinner together. That'd be great. Worms? No, spaghetti. What are you waiting for? Dig in. Uh, that's how they eat spaghetti in Russia. I-I... Did you know this? I had no idea. But... It's certainly more fun. I'm really glad you have a new friend. Yeah. A friend. So I'm guessing Coke and spaghetti are your favorite things now. Very much so. Oh, this is my favorite part. ♪ I had the time of my life ♪ ♪ No, I never... ♪ Come on. You leap, and I'll catch you. I've always wanted to do that. Oh... I got these... two birthdays ago. And I've never really had anyone to share them with. What is it? They're friendship bracelets. You get half, and I get half. So we're never really apart. And when we really are together, they're whole. Can I ask you something? Anything. Who are you really? You know, the bushes the day at the playground. The necklace that glows. You're different. I know it. Yes. I don't understand. How is that even possible? When Lenin rose against us, Rasputin created a portal to a place where we would be safe. He sent me through with this amulet. For it's glow would guide me to someone I could trust. But my family... I was the only one who made it through. Well... do you know what happened to them? No. Only what's in the book. It's OK. I'm glad you found me, even if you had to time travel to meet me. I'll always be here for you. Besides... we're family now. OK. I'll pick you up at ten, but no later. And no walking home. We got it. Thanks, Mom. Don't call me Mom, it's Mummy. Right, Mummy. Oh, and girls, happy All Hallows' Eve. Come on. Remember, it's all fake. Plus, she's, like, four. Trick or treat? One quick stop before the party? Do we get trick and treat? Watch and learn. Actually, why don't you do it? Everyone loves a princess. Especially a real one. So I just knock on the door, and they give me things? Yep. That's the power of Halloween. Knock harder. Trick and treat? Have you found her? She has eluded me. Time is ticking. Find the girl and bring her to me. Dude, you are way too old to be trick or treating. The haunted house party is gonna be amazing. Dude, everyone in town is gonna be there. OK, we are talking Risky Business amazing. Dude, can I just say for a minute how much I love you? Come on. Let's explore. I think he likes you. How do you say gross? Gross is exactly what you say. Oh, look, it's Queen Bee Beatrice. Victory. Come on. A haunted maze. A haunted maze? - I give up. - Trust me. You're gonna love it. - Hey! - I'm telling. OK, so the fun is figuring a way out. Don't we just go out the same way we came in? Nope. Keep up! Megan... Megan? Rasputin! How did you find me? Are they... OK? Rasputin... It is time to go home, child. Megan! - Megan! - Annie? Annie... Annie. Annie? Looking for your friend? We saw her leave... without you. We march to you now. You have done well, Rasputin. We await. No! Where's your friend? I just wanna go home, Mom. But... OK. Is she OK? She's fine... I guess. OK. Cool costume, freak. I'm Ashley Anderson with Channel 3 News, and we are live on the scene the accident that has caused quite a disturbance - this Halloween night. - Mike, we're here at the scene. It's absolutely nothing but carnage around here. And the children are running around screaming. We have no idea what exactly has gone on. Uh, we can tell by the way that the cars are all being pushed... This is Blake Hanson, reporting for WAFP, where just ten minutes ago, here at the park, there was a horrific accident. Now, first responders are already on the scene, they're cleaning everything up. - Seriously? - This was on the intersection of Fourth and Magnolia. We are asking people to take alternate routes home just to make sure that there's no backups. Again, looks like first responders are doing an amazing job. - We're first on scene, as always... - Annie?! Blake Hanson here, with WAFP. Where are we going? What are you doing with me? I must take you back, - as he commands. - Back? The portal waits for one more visit. - Through and back. - Through and back? With your return to Mother Russia there'll be no remaining Romanov heirs. And he will do to you as he will do to your family. They are alive? Rasputin, it isn't you. You don't have to do this. To Mother Russia we return. How did...? The magic of TV. Come on. Follow me. Hop on. My portal, I need to get back to it. I can save them. - Well, where is it? - The playground. I'm on it. I know it's here some... That's it! The portal. He's here. Follow my lead. Easy... When I say go... Get ready. Go! We need a plan. Like, now. I have an idea. I'll distract him, you run. This is it. I'll always remember you. Always. I think you forgot something. ♪ If you're lost, you can look and you will find me ♪ ♪ Time after time ♪ OK, you need to go. - Do you trust me? - Yes. At the highest point, we fly. Three... two... fly! This isn't you! Rasputin! Look at me. Look deep inside you. You are more than this spell, I see it in you. The regular you. I must take you to him. Always stand for what is right, no matter the times. We must always stand for what is right, no matter the times. My Anastasia. I'm so sorry. Yes! I'm back. Is it ready? Lenin will soon know of our whereabouts. The link is nearly complete. We must move, Rasputin, now! It is ready. The children first. - Come to me. Come. - No, Papa! We must go through the portal before it is too late. Ana, Ana. The amulet. Let's go. Go. Come on. Are you coming? I cannot. If I come, he will never stop looking for you. Here, I can protect you. And Russia. My faithful friend... Time is of the essence, but when time catches up, find her. Hey, kiddo. If you're not too busy, could you run this gift over to the new neighbors? But they just moved in. We know. But 'tis the season. And we'd like to start off on a good foot. One without any mysterious animal bushes. Fine. Right. It's fixed. You must be here for Grandmother.
