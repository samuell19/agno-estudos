I did get some leads on some day work. You have your job and we have our savings. Sigh, yeah, I guess we'll just stay here until we find a new place to live. Maybe even a place with a back yard next time. And then when we get settled, we'll all get all new things. Won't that be fun Bug? Yeah, but I like my old things, mommy. I know honey, I know. Things are just things, we can replace them. What if we were in that big fire? Ah, I know. We would have gotten out honey. Jones got out. Yeah! But what if was asleep David, uh? He would have woke us up. Yeah! He would have jumped up and down on top of you and he would have said, wake up Tina, wake up. [Little girl squealing] Wake up everybody. We'd all wake up and we'd all run outside and we'd all be safe. So listen, I haven't eaten all day and I'm starving. So what ya say, we go anywhere you want. We can take the bus downtown or we can stay right here in the neighborhood. [Downtown squeals the little girl and little boy, Stay yells the mom.] Wait! Downtown! John's Pizza downtown. Yeah!!!! Go wash up. [Pizza pizza yells the kids] We'll get through this Zen. We will. It will be fine. All right, let's move it. [Men unloading a furniture truck] We don't have all day. Alright let's move it. Looks good. That wraps it. [Man paying the dad] Thanks. It's just. Um, the only problem is, uh, the deposit. No no, we can certainly pay the first and last month's rent. It's not that, it's just, well maybe we can pay the deposit over time? You know? What do you think the deposit's for lady? It's for protection. I know. My protection. I know, believe me, I know that and I understand that, it's just, well you know with the fire, new clothes and things. Look, Mr. Sledge, really, we are very dependable people and I promise. Look, I was willing to overlook the kids, uh? But this is business. First and last month's rent, and one month's security deposit in advance. Uh? Could you just please? Standard, no exceptions, sorry. [Writing out budget] [door opens, you can hear the cars honking] [Mom covering up the kids with blanket] What's this? Sweet rolls they were going to throw out. [Man throws bag across room] They are perfectly alright Mike. [Opening bag and tasting sweet roll] [Opening bag and tasting sweet roll] So how were the kids tonight? Well, how do you think the kids were tonight? I don't know. They were off the walls. Mike, Mike, we've got to get out of here. Don't start. If we could please, please ask Eddie for enough money. No! No! No! I'm already in the hole to Eddie, I owe him $1200 when the plant closed down. So what. He's the one, taking care of Ma. I can't. No, I can't Zinny. I mean, he can't have that kind of money anyways. Alright, alright. Let's at least accept his offer to stay there, uh? If I had family left, we'd go to them. If we went to Eddie's, how are you going to get to your job? Well the kids are going to be out of school in a couple of weeks, right? One of us is going to have to stay home with them anyway. Zin, I can get us out of this jut have a little bit of faith, I'm working alright I'm paying the bills. Look look, together we are not paying the bills Mike. Looks $500 in our savings and $212 in checking account and there is not apartment in this city that we can move into that withoutt shelling out $1400, now come on. Face reality! [Man hits desk with fist] Don't you talk to me like that? I don't talk to you like that, don't you talk to me like that. You are my reality I'm facing. I'm facing you, every day, every night, those kids are my reality. I'm doing what I think is... I'm doing what I think is... I found it the day I went over to the... I've carried them around. I didn't know if you wanted your grandma's ear rings. I should have thrown them away. Hundred times a day you think, where did I put that, then you remember where you put it, safely away. Neatly tucked away, in its place. [Lady crying] Then it gets burned up. [Crying] [Man making soothing noises and kisses lady] I feel like we are standing on this trap door you know. Pretty soon someone is going to pull the lever. We are never going to stop falling. [Lady laughing, crying] Nobody is going to fall. There's a way out. [Kisses and soothing noises] I love you, I love you so much. I love you so much too. [Kisses] [Hugging] [Sighing] Okay you're right you're right. He's my brother. They want to help us, they do. What?

No no, hey. What do you mean you can't accept that? What do you want to do, you want to keep taking part time crap that's' getting you nowhere? I give you the tools, you get a job, and you get your own place, this way I get my TV back. It's a bargain at half the price. [Sigh] Hey, I didn't mean it that way. Look come on. [Slapping] I didn't mean it; I just was trying to help ya out Mikey, that's all. Are you going to thank me? Thank you! [Door slams] [Hits walls] Sorry Daddy. Oh David, come here. ** Come on hey, it's kind of like Christmas. That's a beaut right now. Yeah, it's a real beaut. ** ** You got it? Did you get it? I got it. [Yelling happy] Oh God, when do you start? How much do you make, when can we get out of here? I start tomorrow, he's a really great guy, it's a small crew, so everybody does everything you know.

I've been going into that grocery for 12 years, 12 years and you know I can't go back there ever. Food stamps! Your wife has been using food stamps. Now everyone will think I'm some crummy welfare bum. [Kids wondering what's going on] There's nothing wrong with it Eddie. Hell there isn't. Don't you cuss in my house either? You don't do the shopping; you don't know how much thing cost. Your right. He doesn't know anything. If he knew something he wouldn't come running for his life. I didn't run to you, you asked me. So don't give me that. What was gonna let you do? Let you sleep in the street? Maybe I should've this time. When you lost the last job, I lost nothing alright.

Yeah, and so are we. Damn you, they are only paying our rent. I'm working. If you weren't around, I'd in the exact same boat as her. Is that what you want Zin? Is that what you want? You think you'd be better off if I wasn't around? No, all I was saying is there is not much difference between us. Maybe you're right. Maybe we'd all be better off. Daddy.

Got tired of my face getting cut. My ribs cracked. My fingers broke. I lost my job, because I couldn't find any day care. Then I lost the apartment, because I couldn't pay the rent. I've been on the list for city housing for so long, I can't remember, but I don't wake up black and blue and nor do my kids, and for that I'm grateful every morning I wake up.
