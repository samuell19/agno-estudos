A ToM Share @ XMR - What happened? - Nothing! Open the door! - Open the door, Jeevanlal! - Wait! - What is the matter? - Don't pretend, you have committed a theft! Theft and me?! You could have tried someone else but you tried to rob an inspector? Do you know how much the necklace that you have robbed costs? It costs five thousand rupees! Five thousandl... What nonsense are you speaking? I was sleeping when you came here. You are accusing me of theft but actually, you are the thief! Do you think it is decent to enter someone's house, middle of the night? If you hand over the loot, I'll see that you don't get a severe punishment. Or else, you will be locked up for years, do you understand? Get out from here! You can threaten someone else... I've dealt with the police even earlier! I know that you want to search my house... but if you don't find anything then tell me, how should I punish you? Search his house! I will see to it that you are suspended from your job! After all, you have to live in this area, I'll deal with you later. - There is nothing inside. - I give you one more chance. Tell me the truth, where is the loot? Sir, its here! You scoundrel! How dare you! - I will kill him! - Leave him! Leave me, let me deal with this boy! Sita, I told you he was not my son! Leave me! - Hold him tight and handcuff him! - Alright, do it. Please don't hit him! Take him away while I get the loot. - Move away! - Please don't take him away! I will surely settle my scores with all of you! Jeevanlal alias Sunderlal, is announced a punishment of 4 years... under the IPC section 3538- 372. Alright, I will do as you say. But it is not a good idea to mortgage your house. When Jeevanlal comes back, he will fight with me! He will not say anything, I promise! - Instead of your house, why don't you keep your land... - No, Lalaji! I will not give my land! It is the remembrance of our ancestors, they will be hurt! The land is like a farmer's mother, how can one make its deal? On whose land will my son sow crops when he grows up? You give me money for my house! - Think once again! - Yes, I have. Alright, I will make the calculations. - Leave my hair! - No, I will not! - You won't? Dharma, what are you doing? Leave her or I will hit you! Leave him! - She hit me! - He teased me! - No, she called me useless! - That is what you are! - No, you are! - Shut up! Don't you dare hit her, she is a girl! But she uses more expletives than the boys! Haven't I told you not to play with the boys? I did not play with him! Dirty girl! Wonder what they shared in last birth, they fight whenever they meet! Wonder if it was the last birth or is it this birth... - Come, your papers are ready. - Coming! Come, put your thumb impression here and take the money. - We shall make a stamp paper later, isn't it Lalaji? - Yes, manager. - Uncle, did you have a good harvest? - Yes, with the mercy of God! What is the matter Dharma, is this the vibrancy of youth? No uncle, this is the vibrancy of the harvest! A farmer feels vibrant when he gets a good harvest! True! I also got a good harvest but my youth... Uncle, atleast think about your old age! I don't know anything, all I want is my money or I shall take your land! I am your debtor, you can take away anything you want... and if possible, you leave some crop to provide me one meall... but please don't take my land from me! He is not denying that he owes you money. Really! Forget the principal amount, he hasn't even given me the interest! How can he give when the interest is a lot more than the principal amount? That is bound to happen after all, it is business! But don't mete out this injustice with this poor man. Don't add up more interest or he will die under its weight! How will he die? Am I the one to decide that or God? After God, you have the authority! - How is that? - When a man dies, his soul goes to God... isn't it? - True! - And when he is alive, he comes to you. - Isn't it? - He will come if he is in trouble. So aren't you the second in command? You solve his problems! Isn't it? That is true! But before his first problem is solved, the second one comes up! Son, tell me clearly! Its your interest which keeps on multiplying! - That is bound to happen! - And repaying this, he's left with nothing! Neither his house nor his land then, you come to him asking for your money. Isn't it, uncle? Thus, he finally dies and reaches to the God above! You all have grouped up against me, this is no justice! - What do you want? - Uncle, take the interest but don't multiply it! Have mercy on this poor man, his young son passed away recently. His hands are not strong at this age! That's what I meant, when he can't plow, how will he give my money? Don't worry, uncle. His son died but we are yet alive! - We will all work for him. - Yes, we will! We all will work together and repay his debts. Manikram, are you convinced now? Chaudhry, I am concerned with the money, how I get is not my concern! - Lets go, the decision is taken! - Yes, let us go! Let us go, manager. Dharma my son, I will try hard to repay Lalaji's loan. But I don't know how to repay your favour? Uncle, don't say that, does a father owe a favour to his son? May you prosper, son! I had come here to see that if there are some more people like you... then this country will progress a lot! What are you saying? We belong here, it is you who has made a sacrifice! You have left your home and town to serve the poor people like us! - I was just coming to you. - For your mother? - Yes. - I am going out now, send her tomorrow morning. - Alright. Hey, you mare! You rogue! You teased me again? - Why did you throw a stone on me? - Should I throw candies on you? You are fond of being hit by me! You witch! Come down, I'll break your bones! You come here, I will mince you! Are you a woman or a menace? If you come up then don't forget, this tree is laden with mangoes... I will hit you with them! Let me see how you hit me! - Stop, I say! - Nothing can stop me now. - Don't you dare come near me! - Even I have decided today... either you will live in this village or me! It will be you who will not live here! Dharma, that branch is not strong, it will break! I don't care! But today, I will die and kill her too! - Where are you running, you lizard? - You are a tortoise! - You get scared of a woman! - I get scared? Hey stop! You both will fall! Stop! You will fall! Hey, slOP! See, I told you! - Now where will you run? - Don't you dare touch me! - I will kick you! - Look at yourself, you look so funny! You look at yourself! Rogue! Aren't you ashamed of using your strength on a woman? ' Woman?! . Why are you laughing? What else you expect me to do? You aren't a woman! - Who says that? - The whole village says it! Why don't you take names? - I am not scared, the doctor was saying! - Lets ask him! - Come on! The beats of your feet are not stable! You do not have fever! You are alright but you are possessed with a spirit of a Goddess! - What will happen now? - Lie down, I will tell you! I will call the spirit of the Goddess here! Abracadabra! Goddess, please appear before me! - I will deal with him now! - Go ahead! - Come with me. - I said, come in. - Why should I? You go in. Alright, you stay here, I will go inside. Goddess, please appear! Here comes the Goddess! Goddess, please appear! - You rogue! - You?! - You have spoilt my name in the whole village. Someone please save me from her! Father, here we come! - We were busy. - Didn't you tell Dharma that I am not a woman? Gauri, how can he tell such things when he is not sure of himself! - Shut up! - You are a rich man's daughter, how can he say that? Yes, father wants you to be his daughter in law. - The younger one! - No, the older one. - Have you'll seen your faces? Oh! Let us go and see our faces. - What is this? - Let it be, this is the invention by my sons. This has to be pierced in the body for a long time. - He is not a doctor, he is a fraud. - He is not qualified to be a doctor. I will teach you a lesson, come with me! - What did you tell Dharma? - But where is Dharma? - Gauri, he has fooled you! - The creep! I will set him right! How dare he fool me? - Brother, what is this? - Don't you dare laugh at me! Again you had a fight with that girl? Why do you do it? Mother, she is the one who crosses my path always. I was walking and she hit me on my head! - She will obviously hit you! - She loves you that's why, she hits you. - What did you say? - Haven't I stopped you from fighting with Gauri? You know that she is Lalaji's daughter. And every time you get into a fight with her! She may be Lalaji's daughter but that witch... What did you say? Mother, stop her or I will hit her, she will get killed! You will kill me? Come here, I will set you right! Oh sure! You will hit me, just try doing that! - Come here, I shall set you right! - Go away, don't threaten me! I will not spare you today! I will hit her, you leave me, mother! Come here, you witch! You could not do anything to me! - You will see me dead if you say anything to her! - Mother! - Come in! - But she hit me! - How was it, brother? Mother! You haven't slept yet? Go to sleep. It is quite late but your father hasn't yet returned. Chamelibai, you are great! - That was great! - You danced very well, Chamelibai. Chameli, come close to... Master, this beautiful maiden looks very nice with you! Okay Jeevanlal, I would like to rest now. Sure master, you will feel better if you rest! I will ask everybody to leave. Come on, everyone leave! Listen Jeevanlal, I am going out for some days. Did you do my work regarding that lady doctor? Don't worry. When you are loaded with money then you have no fear! - Take this! - Now you see what spell I cast on her! - You haven't slept yet? - How can I? - Have you eaten? - No! You idiot! How many times have I told you to eat if I come back late! But you want to starve and make me feel like a sinner! Motherl... Come with me. Mother, I've kept the money there, please go to the doctor. I don't need any medicine, I am alright. - What does that mean? - I said I am fine! Instead, save up money for Meena's marriage. Mother, is your life more important or her marriage? Didn't I tell you not to grow up so soon? And look, how you have grown up! Look at yourself, your head almost reaches the roof! We men are supposed to be tall, its because of you'll we have to look down! - Mother, you will not go? - No. - Alright. - There is no money here. - It has to be there, I haven't taken it. I found it, mother. Gauri, I was looking out for you. My mother has fallen sick... I cannot leave her alone, will you please go and give lunch to my brother? You want me to give lunch to that scoundrel? Gauri, do you really love my brother that much? Love?! I wouldn't even look at him! - Then why do you'll fight? - I don't have spare time. - I will be very happy the day he... - Gets another woman as his wife? Okay, I will take his lunch if you insist. But what if he hits me? You don't talk to him, just keep his lunch and walk away! Go now! Hey! Tell your brother to eat his lunch. Tell him to eat or he will starve to death! Hey! Tell your relative that I will not eat anything touched by her! Tell him, if he wants he can eat or go to hell! - You go to hell! - Your elders can go to hell! - May your family be damned! - May your entire clan be damned! Shameless man! Have you forgotten the thrashing of that day? Shut up! I will cut your neck and hang it on my door! I came here to give you food and you are abusing me? - You dog! - What, you called me a dog? Does your father feed me? - Yes, he does! - Wait! I will teach you a lesson now! - Where are you running, I'll throw in the well. - Leave me! - If you are dead, you won't trouble me anymore. - Leave me! - I will not spare you today! - Leave me! Let me go! Hit me now! Let me see what a man you are! - Gauri, you go from here. - No, I will not go! - Why are you crying? - I am crying because you are a coward. I will go and tell the entire village that you hit me! Why are you following me? Its a democratic country, I can go wherever I want! Oh really! - Go now! - Won't you be disgraced if I go ahead? - People will say that you are pursuing me. - I know everything. First you hit me and now you are feeling sorry for it. Why can't you tell me clearly that you want to apologise? A person is not disgraced if he apologises. Come here so that I can apologise! You have to apologise and you want me to come to you? - You come here! - You are making it sound like a government tax... which I have to pay at a particular place. Come here! - I will not! - You are making me apologise and also acting smart? Yes, I will do it. If you want you come here or I will leave! Its quite late and my compounder is also not around. I know but I am helpless, the madam is very sick. And if you don't reach in time then she may perhaps die! - Okay, I will come but... - You don't worry. You will be brought back safely! - What is the problem? - Well, she is not feeling too well. And she gets the urge of throwing up! Father, the landlord doesn't have a wife then who is calling for her? - What? - I spoke about the landlord. You should have thought of this village's honor. Alright, if she doesn't wish to go then let the landlord deal with her! I am not concerned with it! - Was he your father? - I have tried hard to reform him. Everyone has tried it. But I cannot say anything after all, I am his son! What relation is this wherein, a son cannot say anything to his father... a wife cannot say anything to her husband. - Why don't you... - Tell me whatever you have to. Please don't tell about this to anyone else. Meena is getting engaged day after tomorrow. With great difficulty we have got a nice match. They said that they cannot punish the daughter for her father's sins. - I am pleading to you! - Don't say that, Dharma. I am obligated to you myself. Anyway, you came here for medicines... I will just get it. You have gifted a very beautiful dress and a necklace to my daughter. Sister, your daughter is like my daughter too! We are very poor, we cannot offer much. - Please sit. - Please consider our daughter as a form of Goddess Laxmi. What more could I ask for, sister? - Please fix the wedding date. - We shall do it as soon as possible. Seek her blessings, son. - I will drop them to the bus station. - Goodbye, sister! - Congratulations, sister! - I want my daughter to be happily married. I hope there aren't any obstacles in the marriage. You will cry a lot when she goes away, isn't it, mother? That is right but then I will consider one of my duties fulfilled. Don't worry, once your daughter will go, your daughter in law will step in. She will get her fate with her, child. - Brother! - What happened to you? - He is a cry baby! He has a weak heart like a bird! - And you are strong as a lioness? - Yes! When will she get married and go from this village? How is she harming you? Perhaps, she may marry in the same village... May she be cremated here! He is talking about me getting cremated? I will not spare him! May your wedding procession turn into your death march! - Why do you argue with him? - When did I argue with him? - He is the one... - She is the one who fights with me always! - You both trouble me a lot! - I don't trouble you. Madam, I cannot settle accounts with this fool. He drives me crazy, you please deal with him! Manager, you will have to do that! Come along! - Greetings, sister. - Greetings, aunty! - ls Lalaji at home? - Yes. - Come on, tell me. - Write down. - What will I write if you don't say? I remember, the grocer for 2 paise! - What did you say? - I meant the groceries. - Alright. - Brinjals for 4 paise. - Okay. - Eggs for 50 paise. - Eggs for...what did you say? - That's not what I meant! I've said not to settle money with an illiterate man and a beautiful woman! - Isn't it? - What can I say? What brings you here? Uncle, didn't I tell you that a man has to come to you when he is alive. - So, here I am! - You are joking with me again? How can I dare to do that, uncle? I have come here to talk about my daughter's marriage. I needed some money for that. Is that all? You know that I've never refused you for money. Whenever you needed money, all you did was sign the papers and got it. But now when I open my vault, all I can see is those signatures! But its the matter of her daughter's future and the village honor. You are also right. Alright, I will give loan against your land. No, not the land. Against the land, we can fulfill one time expense... but the harvest takes care of many expenses! But this time you will get the money only against your land. Iam not talking to you! Can't uncle answer my questions? - Is he a fool? Answer him, uncle! - Yes. I have told you many a times not to interfere in my matters. - What would be the value of your harvest? - Around five thousand. - But we need only two thousand. - Manager, give him the money. It is the matter of a girl's marriage, we should compromise. Now are you happy? Are you also happy? Someone get the wood! Will someone get a girl? - What did you say? - I asked for the wood! Hold it well or you will drop it! - Who let you in? - I don't need an invitation! You idiot, its my sister's marriage! Its my friend's marriage, you numskull! - Is a sister more important or a friend? - A friend, ask her! - Yes, Tell her! - A friend! - What does that mean? - If a brother was important... then would he rejoice with the thought that I am leaving? No Meena, don't say that! Wonder by whom this custom was formed. It was made by you men! Someday, even you'll get some woman crying here! - No, I will love her a lot. - Do you mean it? - I promise! - You are lying! You will forget everything at that time, you all men are cheats! Stop her Meena or I will hit her again today! Just try doing that! Stop her, I am losing my temper! I can't, this is regular feature, only God can deal with you! - Do you want someone else to defend me? - Oh sure! I will see to it that you get married to a very wicked man. He will ill-treat you and you will return back crying to your house! Did you hear the way he cursed me? - And whatever you spoke was no less! - I did not say anything. I was just listening to him. Should a man speak like this to a woman? - I think he was expressing his love. - ls this the way to express love? Your brother is stone hearted, he is not fit to be loved! No, I know him better, after all he is my brother! He said it without meaning it, if he learns that someone is eying you... then he will kill that person! Really? You wait here! - What is it? - Nothing. You are smiling, I am sure there is something! I cannot say it in front of everyone. We'll just be back! - Whom are you looking for? - Don't worry, nobody will come here! - I was just joking. - This joke has got me close to you! How far will you run? Don't torture me anymore! Make me happy! Come, let me make you happy! Lets run! Shameless woman! Aren't you ashamed? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? I will tell you. Becausembecause, you are a fool! I am a fool? Come close! Sweetheart, I can give my life to you! You are a liar and a very selfish man! Who is not selfish? Look, what I have made for you. Let me see, this is great! What is it?...You?! Why have you come here? Father, I have come to take the necklace. Is this a goldsmith's shop? It isn't but you have made it! I say leave from here, this is not our house, its a dancer's house! A son and a father can never meet together in such a place! Father, aren't you scared of the repercussions of your act? This necklace was given by Gauri's in laws... if they don't see it during the wedding, they may return back! Nobody will ever marry your daughter! I don't have any children! If I had, your grandfather wouldn't write the property in your name! And your mother and you wouldn't guard it so closely! You can take away everything that we have but return back the necklace. You have no right over your daughter's gifts. There is no bigger sin than that. Have you come here to teach me what is good and bad? A man does many bad deeds but once his conscience is awakened... his life is complete! Get out from here! Please forgive me, we were not worth you! Stop this marriage! Come Premnath, you will not get married here! - Father! - Nothing doing! This marriage cannot take place. - Please, sir! - Don't plead! - Uncle, please! - Please have mercy on us! - I don't wish to defame my esteem! I don't want the world to ridicule me! - Uncle, what will the people say? - I have to show it to the people! - Uncle please, for the sake of my honor. - Move this away! Have you ever heard that the girl's side don't give any dowry and... whatever was gifted from the boy's side, is also seized by her parents? My son earns Rs. 300/-, is this his worth? A son in law is very precious... how can we evaluate him with money? Don't talk to me, Dharma. lam not a very nice man! - Don't explain me anything! - Please give me a chance. - I'll get his house checked and send him to jail. - Please let me talk! Will you give our jewels or should we return back? I plead to you! You can take my necklace instead. - But please don't return back. - Our village will be defamed. I don't care! Give me back my jewels or I shall return back. - Sister, please... - Don't call me sister! - What will we do now? - Only God can save you, sister! Aunty! - This belongs to you! - What is it? Your jewels. In your prayers, please think about me too! My child! Aunty, years back, a wedding procession came in the same way... but it returned back. Where I was then and where I am now! I feel as if once again, my wedding procession is returning back. - You are a Goddess! - Every woman is a form of Goddess, aunty. But she should get a brother like Dharma. Wait! You also attend the wedding. No aunty, my place is not here, I belong in the background. Where there is no light but only darkness! My shadow should also not fall on someone. If I knew it then I wouldn't accept this proposal. Stop, Uncle! These are your jewels. Where were they earlier? They were lost somewhere! - That is a lie! - Forget all that and lets go inside. Not only theirs but the entire village's honour is at stake! Although its their fault but we are apologising to you! Give this to me. The fight was due to these jewels, now why don't you agree? - Alright, if you insist! - That's like it! Let the music begin. Come, lets go inside! Weren't you supposed to go out? Jamuna, our Gauri has grown up! So you have noticed her today? I've been saying that since a long time! But I did not notice it until today! Especially, after Jeevanlal's daughter's marriage. I will search for a suitable boy right away! Thank God that you are concerned now! Find a match close by, not far away from this place. - What? - Don't find a boy from another village. Lalaji, listen to what he says! - What? - Jeevanlal's son is giving away his land to his father. - So what? - God forbid, if the crops are destroyed... or his field catches fire then from whom will you recover the money? - The one who owns the land! - Will that goon Jeevanlal give your money? What nonsense! He can never dare to behave that way with me! His father will have to sign wherever his son has! Instead of signing, he will start a fight! He can't get away, isn't there a law prevailing in this country? We are going to the court now and on our return we shall go to his house. We will check out his health. But before that, what if he insults us? Why are you so scared of him? - What is this? - Are you blind? Can't you see, its your food. Yes, but why have you got it? Your mother is sick and your sister is married now... do you have a wife at home? I could have gone home. After working so much, you will even go home to fetch your lunch? - Won't you get a wife home? - I will...when I need one! Don't you need one now? No! Alright, I will take back your lunch. - There, you started teasing me again! - When did I do that? I pronounced your name in the right way! Okay, tell me whether you want to eat food or my abuses? Both! I am really very hungry! Come, start eating! Hey, this doesn't taste good! Your abuses add spice to the food! - I will never abuse you, henceforth! - Why? Because, you have started enjoying my abuses, you really are a fool! - With you, I should deal in a reverse way. - What do you mean? When you want me to talk lovingly, I will abuse you... and when you want to hear my abuses, I will... - Then? - Thenmnothing! When I want her to talk lovingly, she will abuse... and when I want her to abuse, she will?... She will love me! - I have understood, Gauri. - What have you understood? - The same thing! - What? - That one feels! - What? As though you aren't aware of it! I am not aware but if you know then, tell me. - First you tell me. - No, you tell me. Look, I am already suffering, don't harass me more. Even I have a lot of sorrows! If our sorrows come together then won't it be a joyful union? Even I feel the same as you! - What do you feel? - You are so naive! - There is a fire within me! - You must be on fire... but I am not on fire! Liar! There is no smoke without fire! The lightning strikes in the skies! Uncle, see Dharma is having opium! Yes, how come he has changed today? Someone must have had that effect on him! You are trying to boss over me in my house? You want interest, take this! Please save that man! Constable! - What is the matter? - Jeevanlal is killing my man. - Please come and save me. - If you come ahead, I will kill you! Wanted to kill me! Jeevanlal, until now I kept quiet. But now I will see to it that your condition is worse than a pauper! You can do what you want! - You move away! - Constable! - Don't you dare move! - Don't threaten me! Are you trying to scare me? I was in the jail for 10 years! You are offended, brother? I was just kidding. You are respected in this whole village! Don't I consider your wife as my sister? I may be a thief... but you thrive on people's blood! You are a wolf in a guise of a man! - Catch him! - Leave me, I say! Let me see how Jeevanlal lives in this village now! Someone save him! Dharma, the police has arrested your father! Dharma, the police has taken your father! Hey! Come here. Manager, why are you behaving like a child? - Lalaji, this dog... - Who are you then? - How are you, aunty? - Greetings, brother! Brother... I am sorry for my husband's behavior. I have come here to apologise. Father! Brother, a wife is called a better half. A wife shares half of her husband's good or bad deeds! I have come to tell you that I consider all his sins as mine. - Please forgive me! - Father, aunty is talking to you. I know it! Brother, I know what you must be going through. Forget that! Do you know how your husband has mercilessly hit him? You keep quiet and don't interfere! She should, brother! If you are hurt, won't she also be hurt? And you are aware that I do everything for my house. Why did you speak about the land with him? You could have spoken to me or my son, Dharma. Stop treating your son like a saint! I can bet on my mustache that he'll be few steps ahead of his father! Father, what will she do with your mustache? Gauri, you are turning out to be audacious! Brother, you have not understood my Dharma, he is very nice. Alright, tell him not to transfer the land in his father's name. I promise he will not do it! - You please forgive me. - Please forgive her, father. She is pleading so much in front of you! I would have dealt with them if you were not around. I become speechless in front of you! Yes aunty, there are two people here who don't speak much, my father 8- me! - Aunty, is everything fine? - Yes. You'll have done many favors on us. Scoot from here! You children of a donkey! - Yes, father! - You have grown up and still playing marbles here? Aren't you'll ashamed? Today is the festival of Dassera. On this day, Lord Rama had won over Lanka. Similarly, today you have to win over Lalaji's daughter, Gauri. And then, you have to marry her. - Get married? - Both of us? - Obviously you'll and not me! - Come. - But father, Ram had got the victory and my name is Shyam! Father, I hope you aren't getting confused between Ramayan 8- Mahabharat. No, I am chalking a new chapter in history. Idiots, I'm taking you along so that Lalaji likes atleast one face! And listen, don't act funny when you reach there! - Father, you don't worry! - We will behave ourselves! Sons, in this attempt, even I was left as a bachelor. Father, are you a bachelor? And the one at home whom we call mother, is she your mother? Let us go! Father, you have perhaps forgotten that you married our mother. Yes, she is our mother! Fools! She wasn't your mother before her marriage. That is right! Yes, this is India, not the west! On my signal, you will bow in front of Lalaji and seek his blessings. Wow! There must be a feast prepared in his house today. - Father, will we get a chance to eat them? - Of course, you will! But when they offer you something, don't grab it immediately. Its alright if they force you. - And what else? - Remember, everything has two names. One is the normal and the other is in Sanskrit. You speak in Sanskrit. For example, call a sweet dish 'prasad' and call water 'jal'. - And what do we call our shoes? - My head! Did you'll understand? We understand, father. Firstly, we don't understand things too well. And once when we understand, we never forget it! - Come, let us go now! - Shall I come dressed like this? No son, you will have to dress up very well. Alright, I will wear the clothes that I wear on the stage. Very good! Let us go! - Dassera greetings, Lalaji! - Wish you the same! - Welcome! - Greetings, Lalaji! - Wish you the same! Lalaji, I have come with a request on this auspicious day of Dassera. - Please tell me! - Thank you, Lalaji. What are you'll doing there? Come here and seek Lalaji's blessings! - Come here, I say! - Father, you said we should come when you signal us. Father, signal us! - Please stop them! - Lalaji, they are very affectionate children. Stop it Ram and Shyam! - Are they your children? - Lalaji, bless them quickly! Please forgive us! - Did you offer them snacks? - First let them settle down. Manager, get some chairs. - Son, will you eat 'ladoo'? - Sure!...we don't eat 'ladoos'. But if someone persists then we surely eat! They cannot digest these 'ladoos'! - Get something else for them. - Pudding! Gauri, get some pudding for them. Get it soon or they will kill each other! - I am ashamed for their behavior. - No, they are very affectionate! That is right! It is very rare to find such children! Only the fortunate ones get sons like them! - I have only two of them! - They are enough! Lalaji, actually I had come here to speak regarding Ram and Shyam. Well, I wanted your advice for their marriage. - Actually the thing is... - That's a very good news! - Your Gauri... - Why are you feeling shy, is the sugar right? What is the matter, Ram? Eat the pudding! Lalaji, he is very mischievous! What is the matter, son? - Lalaji, my Ram... - Call him Ravan! Thank God, it has come out! Is there any other show that you would like to present? When should we come with the wedding procession? Leave or I shall kill you! - Dharma, I am going back to the city. - Suddenly? Yes, its been long since I have met my brother, Ravi. Doctor, in your presence, it was fun to fall sick. The villagers have a lot of faith in you. Can't it be possible that once you come here, you don't return back? No Dharma, I am not required here anymore. - Why, what happened? - I mean, when there are doctors like Ram 8- Shyam... then why should I be here? Dharma, take this. I've written my address on it. Your mother's health is fine but if you need anything, do write to me! Alright, I will leave now. What are you doing here, Gauri? Say something, what is the matter? Go and ask her! - Ask whom? - Ask her! - 0h, her? - You seemed to be very comfortable with her! - What were you'll speaking? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Oh yes, she was saying that she likes me a lot. Oh my! She said that so clearly? Obviously! ls it right to twist the topic? I don't know! - What did you tell her? - I... - What could I say? I told her clearly... - What did you say? I told her that I like you a lot! - Oh my! - I shouldn't have said it? ls it wrong to speak the truth? Sure! You can speak the truth with her and keep on lying to me! Is she more beautiful than me? What are you saying? Haven't you seen her style of talking? The girls from a big city are all shameless. Really? But do you know how educated she is? Yes, she is educated and you are a village bumpkin! Will you understand her language? - I don't understand English? - ls there any sweetness in that language? You are not aware how romantic that language can be. Besides, love is not everything, taking care of the house 8- children... their education, can a village belle do all this? Shut up! Aren't you ashamed? That woman is trying to bewitch you! She will lure you in such a way that you will not realise it! Stay with her for 2 days, only then will you realise it. Here, I am willingly serving you! I get your food, I am even willing to serve you when you come back tired. I don't impose anything on you. Never mind, I have faith in God! I will go wherever my destiny takes me! - Don't call me. - Listen to me. - Leave me and go to her! - I was just kidding. - You are offended and crying? - Yes, I am but as if you care! You mad girl, I love you! I cannot live without you, I mean it. - But I can live without you! - Gauri, come back! For my sake, for the sake of my love, Gauri! - Mother! - What is it? - Open your mouth. - Why? - I said open your mouth! - That's like it! - Leave me! Why are you showering so much affection today? Mother, while I was on the farm, I felt very sorry at your plight. Father is never at home, Meena is married now... I am away the whole day, wonder what you must be going through! - What do you mean? - What can I mean, mother? I want you to make some arrangement wherein, you don't feel lonely. Are you talking about me or yourself? About me? Mother, I can be busy with various things. I am concerned about you. All day long, you sit alone at home. - I like the way I am! - Oh mother, you don't understand! Listen, don't you want to see a beautiful face in this house? - No, I don't want. - But I want it, mother. - I want it for your sake! - I want you get married as soon as possible. Mother, don't get me married! Besides, how is it going to help? I am concerned about you, why don't you get a daughter in law for yourself! I'll get a nice girl from my maiden village, girls there are very pretty! Mother, you are too much! Why do you need to go that far? Remember, when Meena left you had cried a lot. So do you want that the girl's parents should also cry? If the girl lives close by, she can go to her mother's house too! You are right. Banarsi, the sweetmeat vendor's daughter has grown up. There you go again! Can't you see someone on this side? Say clearly that you like Gauri! - Which Gauri are you talking of? - You don't know? - Oh! That Gauri? The one who is Manikram's daughter? Mother, I am willing if you insist. But mother, will Manikram agree? How will not? I will plead to him for Gauri's hand! He may not respect others but he will surely not dismiss what I say. I will speak to him today itself. - But mother, what is the hurry? - My dear son, I am in a hurry. Weren't you ashamed of behaving like this? Luckily, only he has seen you... how would I face the people if others would also see you? - I have not sinned, father! - Look at her, she is arguing with me? You will teach me right and wrong, do you know who his father is? - He is a thief! - How can a son be blamed for his father's deeds? Jamuna, stop her or I will silence her forever! I will cut her into pieces! - Lalaji, please listen. - I plead to you, please go from here! Jamuna, ask her how she is connected with Jeevanlal's son? Why aren't you speaking? What does he mean to you? - Everything! - Gauri, aren't you ashamed of talking like this to him? Isn't he ashamed of asking me these questions? Is that so? I will deal with you later! I will deal with them too! Jamuna, this is too much... whenever that goon went to jail, I took pity on his family and fed them. And I nursed that man's son! They never returned my money back neither did I ask for it. And today, he could dare to stand up against me? - Manager! - Yes, Lalaji! - Open all their past accounts. Calculate the interest and make the documents... I will wipe out Jeevanlal's entire family. - Father! - All this has happened because of youl... your father is a generous man! - They've seen my generosity... they haven't seen my anger! - Father, please... - Stay away! I will go to his house and teach him a lesson! I swear it, I will turn this boy into a pauper! No father, don't do that, I plead to you! Don't call me father! You don't know how strict I can be. I can really be very bad! I will see to it that they are ruined! I made a mistake, father! I will never go there again! - Do you promise? - I can swear upon anything, father. Then swear upon me! Brother, I came here with a lot of hopes and expectations... you have always helped me, please grant my one more wish! I am helpless. Grown up children are not under their parents control. If Gauri agrees to it then I have no problem. Gauri, your father has left the decision on you. She is feeling shy. This is the upbringing of our women! They will never express their heartfelt desires, come what may! - Gauri, express your feelings. - Don't ask her, brother. - I know it. - I will not marry your son! What are you saying? I never thought of anyone... I never dreamt of any other girl for my son. My son...you'll grew up together and took vows to stay together. Growing up together is different and getting married is different! Look at your status and look at mine! Tell me yourself, why should I poison myself? How can I get married in the house where all vices prevail? Where nobody does good deeds or command a respect in the society! Did you hear that, sister? I have heard but... Mother! This is not possible, mother! There surely has to be something else. My mind or my mouth can speak a lie... but these hands, which held her, can never lie! The duration of my dream was very small! Lalaji, he will not improve! Unless you don't throw him from his house, he'll not stop meeting Gauri. Besides, Gauri is very innocent, unless you don't act tough with him... and take away his field, you cannot save yourself from disgrace. Uncle, please don't do this injustice on me. The sweat of my labour is yet fresh, my crop has not yet not grown... what will I sell and eat throughout the year? I don't know anything! Instead of eying someone else's honor, why don't you sell your own? Don't let a farmer's curse befall on you! The result of bad deeds is bad! Dharamchand alias Jeevanlal, the accusation against you is... Have some mercy on me! Please fear God! Don't threaten me! God is equal to all of us. On the night of 10th September, in Balrampur village... you killed your father, Jeevanlal. I cannot do anything for you! Do you accept this crime? - What are you seeing? Cut the crop. - No, uncle. Yes, I do! Don't you dare touch my crop! This was bound to happen, Jeevanlal had to pay for his bad deeds! Yes but no matter how big a sinner the father may be... That's exactly what I am saying, we are heading towards doomsday! Silence please! Do you have a defense lawyer, Dharamchand? - No. - If you cannot get your own lawyer then the court can help you. - Come on, move! - Throw him out! So now that you have tried everything you could, go call your father! No, I don't need a lawyer. The prosecution can present the witness. And if possible, go call your God too! When I have accepted my crime then why do you need witnesses? The court's proceedings don't end if the accused accepts his crime. I would like to request the court to call for the most important witness... - Move this away! - Dharma, what are you doing? Mrs. Sitadevi, the wife of the deceased! Throw this piece of stone which you worship! The court grants you permission. Sitadevi, the widow of Jeevanlal, come to the witness box. Stop it! This is not a piece of stone, it is the idol of my God! No, the way he has controlled the injustice mete in the world... the same way, even I have him under my control! If he can, tell him to get out from my grasp! Don't disrespect God, as it is we are suffering for some unknown sins. What sin did we commit, just that we toiled a lot all around the year! And we sowed our crops with our sweat and blood! And with our hard work, our harvest was ready! Swear upon this holy Gita that whatever you'll say will be the truth. I could see a glimmer of hope, just then... You are asking this chaste woman to swear upon a holy book? Your God sent Manikram to seize our field? Oh my! Manikram has seized our fields? I will speak only the truth! Sitadevi, is it true that your husband was a debauch? Never mind! This is what God wills! Sir, I plead you not to ask my mother such questions! The one who has given us life, will also feed us! These are mere talks which all the poor people in the world indulge! She won't be able to bear it. She's seen her husband only in one form... This God will not do anything, he will just watch us! That of a God! And if there was any other form, she couldn't see it. Dharma, I did not know that you will lose faith in God! Mother, when we will be dying of hunger, he will be bathing in milkl... I want to prove that the son was not in good terms with the father... due to his debauch nature! And be fed with a feast and all he'll do is keep watching us! You may continue! Sitadevi, isn't it right that few months back, they both had a fight? Some rich man will dress him up in sparkling gold and he'll get blinded! The son had picked up a stick to hit his father. Yes mother, the Gods also accept bribe these days! And then, you hit your son and asked him to leave the village. Mother, besides injustice, what has your husband given you! You will not be compelled to answer any question. He has given me a lot, you don't realise it. But don't forget that justice is above all relations! - What has he given you? - I have got you from him! We request you to cooperate with the court in this matter! Mother! Respected sirs, the murder that was committed by my son... - Mother, please forgive me! - My son! You all are here to give justice to it. But the murder that was committed by a mother of her own son... Go easy, son! You are working as if you will sow today and reap tomorrow! Who will give justice to that crime? You are feeling sorry about losing your land... You are a mother and a wife too! But why do forget that this land is also yours! All the religions preach a wife's duty towards her husband. You were the one who saved it from Lalaji's clutches. If you cannot talk clearly then atleast you can give us a clue... My son, a farmer has to encounter all problems. About the person who killed your husband. If there is no rain, there is a drought... Sitadevi, please tell us who killed your husband? If there is no drought, the moneylender takes away the harvest. Answer, who was the one who made you a widow? And God punishes him for his deeds! Brother Dharma, Meena has come! - My Meena has come! - Your father has also returned! You all are my enemies! You all got together and conspired against me! If there is no money in this house then how did you survive without me? The court is adjourned. You have come after so many months and have started fighting? Incidents of murder do take place, your honor... Let me look at you, I have been anxiously waiting for you! But one thing that makes this case very crucial and gruesome is... Stop this nonsense! Give me the money, I say! The murder of a father at the hands of his own son! - Father! - Move away! I a saying the truth, I have no money, everything has been sold. I don't need to elaborate the status of a father in Indian culture. And this has been attested by the Almighty himself! - Greetings, father! - Hello! Oh! So there is nothing left to be sold? But on 10th September, the accused not only killed his father... There is nothing left to be sold! - I will not let you sell my cow! - Who are you to stop me? He has killed God himself! Your honor, if he is not severely punished for his crime then... I have bought it, you have no right over it. I have no right? I have raised you up and made you a man, move away! The future generation will be ruined with its influence! You have not raised me... Move away, mother! Please excuse me for interfering in the proceedings of the court. Take him away from here or I will kill him today! My name is Ravi Sharma. - Don't do that. - So, there isn't anything in the house? Your honor, I would like to present myself as a defense lawyer. I don't need a defense lawyer! You move away! I have few evidences that prove the accused of being innocent. I have to settle scores with this rascal, lets decide once and for all! But due to some reason, he holds himself responsible for the murder. Aren't you ashamed of behaving this way with your father? This man is going to sell my cow, this man is a monster! Brother, you perhaps don't know that by saving me, you'll kill me further. Shameless! How dare you call your father a monster! Please note this point, your honor! The accused just stated, by saving him, I'll be killing him further. It is evident from this that this man has crossed the limits of... - Don't dare say anything to my husband! - Your husband! Yes, he is my husband. But you aren't my son! Iaw and justice and wishes to commit suicide. In the eyes of law, this offense is as big as a murder! It would be better if I would give birth to a stone instead! - Stop it, mother! - Don't you dare call me mother! The proceedings have begun and we have reached the stage ofjudgment. Get out from this house, I am dead for you and you are dead for me! The accused has already confessed his crime. That is why, your honor... I will pray to God that he should be my husband in the next birth too... Mr. Kaul, you must be aware of this simple rule in the law that... no man can be compelled to testify against himself! But you should not be born to me again! Okay, your God has answered your prayers! Nobody has pressurized the accused to do or say anything, Mr. Sharma. - Go away! I am not scared. - Mother! But your honor, the pressure can be circumstantial too! Good that he has gone, I don't live off his income! This man has taken his sacrifice and honesty to such an extend... that now, it holds no significance! Your honor, in the name ofjustice, I appeal to the court... to present justification on behalf of this man! You have the permission, Mr. Sharma. I request to call Inspector Nath from Balrampur police station. Call him. Inspector Nath, Balrampur police station, appear before the court! Are you coming from a temple? Since when are you in the police force? Atleast there, you must have looked into the eyes of God. He must have reminded you of someone's promises! Since past 15 years. - Did you make the investigations in this case? - Yes. He knows who is right and wrong! Do you know the meaning of investigation? I am wrong that is why, I am leaving this village. Mr. Sharma is trying to insult an experienced police officer. I thought of thanking you for the abuses you hurled on me! Iam not trying Mr. Kaul, lam insulting him! Inspite of 15 years of experience, Mr. Kaul is not aware of anything. - And the last abuse was the greatest! - I haven't abused you! On behest of few people, he agreed that Dharamchand is the murderer. Then who did it? Anyway, our fights have ended. I want to ask him that in the list of his witnesses, does he have anyone... who has seen the accused raising or hitting the axe at the deceased? Nobody will fight with you and come in your way. That is because there was nobody else present at the site of murder. That's why, it can be said, nobody else committed this murder! I want to prove that during the time the accused reached home... and the murder took place, many things transpired which were... not known to him and neither, to my learned friend, Mr. Kaul! This is known to even an uneducated man that... before presenting the case in the court... it is not only necessary, its mandatory that the case... Does Dr. Sonia Sharma live here? Should be thoroughly investigated and then presented. Yes, she lives here, please come in. That is why... Mr. Sharma, what incidents and circumstances are you talking about? I will go and call her. For example, why does the accused need to break the door of his house? The fire of revenge! How much ever he may be seething for his revenge... he wouldn't break the door until, he wouldn't have enough reasons. Your honor, I don't know what the defense lawyer is trying to say. - Hello, Doctor! - What brings you here? ls your mother alright? Actually, my friend has understood but is not willing to accept it. - She is fine, its me who is a little sick. - What is the matter? There must be some scene inside the house that compelled him to kill! Come and sit. Hey! Let them be on. Instead of hinting, why don't you state things clearly, Mr. Sharma. At the time of murder, someone else was present and not the accused! - Now tell me. - Where do I begin from, doctor? - Who was there? - The same whom he has mentioned in his letter. This letter was found by the police but... You know my father, he sold everything that we had... due to some unknown reasons, they did not mention it in the court. All we had was our harvest which Lalaji took away against his loan. That is because, that person has no connection with this murder. There was no work in the village so I came here in search of a job. There is a connection infact, that person is the reason of this murder! A hard working and a honest man like you, will surely get a job here! At the time of murder, there was a girl present in the room... and her name is Gauri! My brother has just returned, I will call him. It could be possible that Jeevanlal was killed by this girl, Gauri. Hence, I would request the court to summon Guari as a witness. Gauri should be summoned at the next hearing. - Take this and refill it. - I beg your pardon! - Who are you? - My name is Dharma. Are you the same who was imprisoned for 3 years for eloping with a woman? I have come from my village just today and that too, all alone! - Did you fight with her? - How did you know? Say 'l swear upon this holy book...' I know everything, you should be ashamed! - You are father of 3 children and... - What? - Did you get one more? - What?...You please listen to me. - What should I listen to? I swear upon this holy book... Oh! So you are talking about Shankar? That whatever I say... - Who is he? - The one who has 6 children and is yet a bachelor! I don't understand this. Will be only the truth! - Doctor! - Brother, you keep on thinking about your cases all the time! Do you love the accused, Dharamchand? This is Dharma, he has come from Balrampur. Is he the same whom you keep on praising the whole day? - No. - Did you ever love him? 0h, I see! But the way you described, I thought he must be an old man. - No! - Tell me one thing... I described him correctly. Brother, you'll have to look for a job for him. Everyone from your village has attended this case... why didn't you ever come? Why not? Tell us, why didn't you come? You'll sit, I will arrange for tea. It is not necessary for the witness to answer this question. - Sit down, Shankar. - I am Dharma, not Shankar! It is, your honor. With this, I wish to highlight something important. Shankar is a father of 6 children. Oh yes! Sit. Now that you are here, you need not worry about anything. You have the permission! Where were you 1-2 hours before the murder? I'll make arrangements for your stay in the outhouse. As far as a job is concerned, I know someone, I'll write a note to him. - In my house. - When you learnt that Dharma had murdered his father... - You will surely get a job. - Thank you very much! Where were you at that time? At home. Please note this point, your honor that... on hearing this ghastly news, when everyone reached there... she was sitting at home? - I got scared. - Of whom? Were you scared of the accused or was there some other reason? Isn't it true that when Dr. Sonia was reading Dharma's letter... you were also present at that moment? - No. - ls this also wrong that you told his sister, Meena that... you would reach his house by 5 p.m.? Have you seen this anklet before? You are under an oath! - Do you say that it is not yours? - No, it is not mine! - You are back! - Yes, doctor. - You have come back quite late. - I had gone to send a money order. So this is also not yours? 0h, I see! Are you hungry? I have made a sweet dish for you! Where did you get it from? - Is this a piece of your dress? - No! You just asked me where I got it from and now you are denying? Don't say any further! My mouth is already watering! You are lying Gauri, this is a piece from your dress! - Can I take a wash? - Sure! Dharma, go that side. - Why did it tear? - I don't know! You know everything! - Brother! - You keep quiet! Your honor, note this point that Gauri's statements are false! Yes, brother! She had connection with the accused... and everyone living in Balrampur is aware of this! I have been observing that you look very different in Dharma's presence. Besides, the letter written by the accused confirms this fact! - What's your interest in him? - The same as one human being has in another! I hope Meena and you must be fine, I will reach on Sunday by 5 p.m... I am glad to know that finally Gauri admitted... ls that all? That she loves me! I have not asked him for anything, Dharma is a very nice man. Your honor, this letter proves that Gauri 8- Dharamchand loved each other. I will do anything for him. Besides this, I have other evidences which prove that... - He needs me at this moment. - And the villagers? Gauri was present in his house at the time of murder. - What? - Do you remember your mission of going to a village? This discussion is absolutely baseless! What is Mr. Sharma trying to prove? I want to prove that Jeevanlal was murdered by Gauri 8- not Dharamchand! - I have not forgotten, brother. - You shouldn't forget. - That is a lie! - This is a fact, your honor! - When are you going back? - Even I was thinking the same. Jeevanlal and Gauri's father shared an old enmity. When are you going back to the village? Jeevanlal was the biggest obstacle in the path of their love! - No! - On the evening of 10th September... Gauri went to meet Dharamchand in his house. - I will go tomorrow morning. - That will be very nice! There she saw Jeevanlal who was completely drunk! On reaching there, write to me about my mother, Meena and Gauri! Seeing him, Gauri's temper rose... he looked at her and smiled, she charged at him... and in that same tiff, this piece of her dress tore and... this anklet broke! - This is a lie! And after that, this woman, with the help of this axe... Sure! Killed Jeevanlal, who was a barrier in the path of her love! - This is a lie! - This is the truth, your honor! When all this occurred, Dharamchand was not present there. - I was there! - Not at the time of murder... - Gauri, you?! - I have come to meet you. When he reached there, Jeevanlal was already dead! - Why, is there anything special? - No, nothing special... And the axe was in Gauri's hand. He asked Gauri to leave from there and... You have come back from town so I came to meet you. For the sake of his love, he took the blame of murder on himself! Come in. No, this is a lie! This radio is so beautiful. Such good things are available in a city. I've never been to a city. Isn't it very big place... Sir, I will tell you. Isn't that place full of activities? Doctor, tell me one thing. Mr. Sharma has done many favors for me. - Ask. - I have heard that the girls there wear very good clothes. He supported me at the time when nobody was close to me. They must be looking very good that is why... But today, by accusing an innocent girl, he is committing a very big sin! Once a person who leaves a village and goes there, never returns back! Why did you do this to him, Gauri? But it isn't his fault. Whom are you talking about? There is something in every man which makes him lose his control. The one regarding whom you have come here, Dharma. Well, I... A husband's murder and that too, committed by her own son... the one who is a part of her! You are a very loving 8- innocent girl then why did you love him 8- turn away? Some people saw me going in the house... and some saw me with the axe in my hand... - This is a lie! - Tell me the truth... and today, Mr. Sharma even proved that Gauri was present there! Was it the truth then or now? That was also a truth and so is this! Aunty! My father told me ifl meet Dharma, he will throw him out of his house. Aunty! Aunty! Hearing that I told Dharma's mother that I am not connected with him. Inspite of that, my father seized his fields. I will see to it that your honor is disgraced! Now you tell me, how can I be blamed for my father's deeds? I still love Dharma very much! Aunty! Child, I wasn't aware that you made this sacrifice for us. You are the daughter of the scoundrel who sent me to jail! I couldn't believe it then and today, after hearing you, I am very happy! I had vowed to destroy your entire family! You don't worry, everything will be fine. How is it possible? My father will get me married somewhere else. Before he gets you married, I will write to Dharma... once he comes back, everything will be fine. Yes child, everything will be fine. - Shall I keep it here? - Yes. - How is Meena? - I had come here for her. She is not too well, she remembers her brother and cries all the while. Please write to him that he should return back soon. Leave me! Don't worry. Gauri, you also stop worrying. I will call back Dharma very soon! Child, please smile now. Father! 'Greetings, mother! I hope Meena and you will be fine... I will reach home on Sunday, by 5 p.m... I am glad to know that Gauri admitted her love for me!... but I am also unhappy to learn that father took the money I sent for you' Father! You have come again? I will kill you today! 'He has crossed the limit of tyranny, I will decide once and for all!... - Father! - You rogue! You have always come in my way. Your son, Dharma'. Inspector, he has once again resorted to hooliganism. He threatens me whenever he meets me! You scoundrel! I will not spare you today. Inspector, is it hooliganism to ask for my rights? He has given only Rs. 2,000/- for a harvest worth Rs. 6,000/-! Will his father pay the balance amount? Mind your language, Jeevanlal! Did you see? This is the language he speaks! He forgets that his house and land is mortgaged to me. Inspector, his wife borrowed money from me... she fed her family and him with my money. Even if he earns all his life, he won't be able to repay my loan. When the interest is more than the principal amount then how can I repay? We have given you a lot more than we took from you. If that is so then this time, I shall take your fields and house too! Father! I shall go to the court and drag you also there! I will see to it that your family begs on the roads! - Shut up! - Inspector, see he is threatening me in front of you. If I get a complain against you or if you dare go near his house... No, father! You will take a decision about me? I will decide about you today! Then I shall arrest you! You'll can go now! You need not worry. Thank you, inspector. Come, manager. The last time you were arrested for only 4 months... this time I will make sure that you get life imprisonment! And I will also see to it that you are disgraced in the society! Aunty, the bus has come long back and Dharma has reached home. Oh! I had gone to reach Meena to the hospital and got delayed there. - How was he looking? - Very good, you go home quickly! Gauri, you have not seen anything, you don't know anything! For the sake of my love, promise me that you'll never say a word to anyone! Our honor is at stake! You go, Gauri! Please say something! Father! Abuse me but say something! - Father! - Dharma, I did not know that Manikram's daughter loved you. You ill-fated boy, finally you did make your decision! She would be our daughter in law, don't tell your mother about this. Now make a decision for me too, kill me also! She has endured a lot but she won't be able to bear this. Promise me that you will not tell this to anyone. I promise father, I will not tell this to anyone. Dharma, till date I did not treat her as my wife... I never treated you as my son... please forgive me, son! Father! Father! Your honor, look towards this lady who is my mother... who has not encountered anything else in her life but sorrows! The one who would bless me and shield me... she felt that with her deeds, she could cover the honor of her family! And if I would tell her the truth then wouldn't I commit a bigger sin? I don't wish to say any further. The court announces deceased Jeevanlal's death, an accident... and releases Dharamchand. What do I call you? Call me your son! Mother! - Mother! - My son! I had already become a widow but... by accusing my son of a murder, I had also died! Son, you have given both of us a new life. How can I thank you? No, thank her, she is the one who has taken up social welfare work. Sister, you always came to me asking me for things... today I am asking you for something. I am asking for Dharma's hand! But please don't ask for an interest... I have forgiven my principal amount as well as the interest!
