I never knew why we prayed so much growin' up. So, one day them Union boys came to my plantation and told me and my folks we were free. Best day of our lives. Mama said our prayers had been answered. I remember me and my folks walking out that plantation till our feet couldn't even feel the ground no more. We just kept walkin'. Kept walkin', but we had nowhere to go. We were free... ...but we had no place to be free. So I'm askin' you, Lord... ...protect me on this journey. Help me reach my piece of the promised land. Deliver me from this evil. Amen. Get in. Move. The war was an unfortunate step in the right direction. Look at what just walked in. Where did he come from? Iron on the bar. Coffee. Please. Coffee. Yeah. Ma'am. Whoa there, fella! Where you think you're headed? I bought a seat. From the man up there. Andy, huh? This fella buy a seat? Yeah, that's right. Just a little bit ago. Says you. Throw me down them shackles. All right. You got papers? I'm free. Irregardless of what you say, you still gotta show us your papers. Come on now. I ain't got all day. Don't make me ask twice. "Mo..." Washington. Washington. Washington? Ha-ha. What an honorable appellation. You carryin'? Give it. Now, you might have passage on this trip, but there ain't nothin' says I got to have you at my back, gun at the ready. Well, what you got in that case? Bible and some dried meat. Hey. Fat boy, wake up. There's a luggage seat in the back. Is that a man or a boy? Well, which would you prefer, madam? Curly. Do you need my gun too? Of course not, Mr. Wheeler. Let's go. All right, stage for Colorado's leavin'. Let's go. Lord, just get me from here to there. -Ma'am. -Ah. Madam. Claude Aloysius Fields, at your service. The Ol' Wildcat from Kentucky. You see? That's me. "Territory of Colorado "hereby grants to Mo Washington, "ownership of this land." Let's go, Andy. Let's go, buddy. All right. I'm comin'. I talked to Curly. Thought you might need this. I seen rattlers out here bigger than you. This is a fine Remington. Lot of power. Needed something easy to handle. -Can't shoot a dead buffalo. -Mm. Quite a few notches in your handle here. You got family out here? No, sir. Just passin' through. Headed west. Just lookin' for a new start. You? Wife and daughter. They're home. Missus is expectin'. Any day now. I don't like leavin' them alone. I'll need it back in the mornin'. Andy, go help the lady. What are you laughing at? Do you feel relieved, Madam? Do you never shut up? Hyah! Hyah! Let's flank 'em. To the right! To the right! Shit. Hold up! Hold up! Drop the rifle! Hold up! Hold up! Get 'em out. What's happening? Road agents. Road agents? Marauders. Hands where I can see 'em, cowboy. Ain't you gonna shoot 'em? I do, they take us all out. If they push for a last stand, they'll get one. Just be glad they're not Indians. Nobody make no sudden moves. Mm. Now, we don't need anyone getting hurt. All right, you boys know what to do. Tommy, what about the money? Don't fuckin' touch me. Tommy! We, uh... We ain't got nothing of value. We ain't got no mail, no gold. Just what the passengers brought. If I want it, it has value. Now, let me see y'all's hands. Huh. You're Tommy Walsh. Tommy Walsh? The bank robber, Tommy Walsh? Let's see what you got, folks. We'll all be on our merry way. Out! Out! Come on out and stretch your legs. You too, chuckaboo. Your presence is requested forthwith, Madam. I'm not moving from this spot. Suit yourself. All right, come on now, folks. Take it easy. I got all the horses. Well, do what you gotta do, but do it real careful. Join us. We're all equals here. Everybody out. I'd do as they say, ma'am. Get on down. All right, gentlemen, let's, uh... let's have a peek at them billfolds. Thank you, sir. Much obliged. That'll do. There ain't shit up here. Just throw all that shit away. Much appreciated. No, it's just clothes. No, they ain't kiddin'. -There ain't nothing up here. -Well, you take it anyway! Yes, sir. And hurry up. Come on, gentlemen. Check underneath. Check underneath. What about the money from the bank, huh? No, there ain't nothing here. Muchas gracias. How about you, amigo? What you got? Couple of coins in here. That's it. All right, pack them up. - Oh... - What the hell? Thunderation. My apologies, gentlemen. No need to alarm you. I don't know, it appears that... There seems to be something wrong with my ticker. Oh, shit! Come on, give me a hand. Get away from me! I'll murder you. Get off me! Brogan! Hey! Take my hand. Take it quick. - Come on and jump! - I can't, I can't jump. Please, take my hand. - I can't, I can't! - Jump! I can't. Son of a bitch! Hey, kid! That hurts! Son of a bitch. Kid, shoot him! Shoot him! Get up. Careful of this. Ow! Look out! You're a good shot. Stay with me. - See that tree right there? - Huh? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, my God! Tommy! Tommy! They got Brogan, bad! He's dying, Tommy. Give yourself up, we can get him to a doctor. What do I do? Heck, you know what to do! Now you do it! It's on you, Tommy. You go and gather up the boys now. Don't tell 'em where the money's at. You just gather the boys! That's just the start of it. Get up. Get up! Get him over here, Curly. Quit it. Come on! Get him up. Boy, you better lower that gun if you don't wanna wind up on the wrong end of it. Get him over here. Easy now, Curly. Easy now. Come help me. Come help me. He ain't got the rights to do this to me. You cockroaches killed Andy. And you wanna talk to me about rights? Curly! You kill him, you hang. There ain't a court that'd convict me. They would after I have my say. Now put that gun down. I'll trust you to keep it down. All right... Mr. Fields, we're gonna get you to a doctor soon enough. There's one back in Brushwood Gulch. All right. All right, first things first. Go gather your team and your stagecoach. Stage went over the cliff, sir. With the woman inside? What about my horses? They scattered. G... God damn it! God damn it. This is what we're gonna do. Curly, you're gonna grab a horse. You're gonna ride Mr. Fields to a doctor. I'm gonna take the mountain pass to Wagon Gap. I'm gonna get the sheriff and a posse and bring 'em here. What about this piece of shit? I'm gonna tie him to this here tree. He'll stand guard. Him? This beanpole? Guard him? That's Tommy Walsh, you know. He can handle himself. Now go get somethin' to tie him with. Go on. God damn it. Corral my goods if you please, sir. Yes, sir. This is gonna be one hell of a night. I'm sorry about your stagecoach driver. You get smart with me? Let's see how smart you are dancin' from the end of a rope. Jesus. Stop! Stop! Stop fuckin' movin'! Now! All right, now listen to me. I've had enough of these cheap shots. I did the honorable thing. I gave myself up. I've been nothin' but calm, courteous, and kind, and I expect a measure of the same, that's all. Or is that too much to ask? Let him go or I'll put you down. Yeah, well... Well, no one's gonna find where I hid that stolen bank loot, now, are they? Some prices are worth payin'. - God damn it. - Ease off. I will kill that son of a bitch. Finish tyin' him. Come on, now! Get a move on. - Dear God. - Now I'm playin' with you. Come on. Phew. Go get the horses. He's bleedin' real bad. You need to put more pressure on it. He's gonna bleed out. Get your ass back on that tree or I'll end you, son! All right, we're gonna get you on that horse, okay? All right. Come on. Oh, the, um... The blue bottle, if you please, sir. Yes, sir. Ah. My own personal supply. Very good. Mmm. Mmm. It was a pleasure making your acquaintance, Mr. Walsh. Night's comin'. So is the cold. You'll need these. Best you gather up some wood before night. And you might need this too. For rattlers. Last thing. He's got a $10,000 bounty on his head. When we come back, and he's gone or dead, well, there'll be a hanging either way. You understand? God damn it. Well, here we are. Coyote and a horse. That's some expert marksmanship right there. You know, you should dig up whoever's rottin' over there. Give yourself another bodyguard, I don't know... Maybe enough of 'em will frighten away my men. Point is, my men are comin'. Now, you'll think it's a call of a bird or rustle of a deer. That's them comin'. Well, they're gonna tear you apart and eat ya. You know, those white folk ain't comin' back. You run away, they'll just hunt you down. You got nowhere to go. You and me, we're stuck together now. They left you to the wolves. The dark is comin'. You fuckin' give me those keys now. Give me those fuckin' keys now! These keys right here? I want the keys. All right. White boy. Don't you ever, in your life, put your hands on me. Don't ever put your hands on me again. Don't even attempt it. You know, I fought for your kind. In the war. My kind? I was at Fort Wagner. I fought shoulder to shoulder with the Massachusetts Colored Regiment. I was there. Bullshit. You know, I never understood why your people just accepted it. Why they just didn't rise up and burn the world down. White boy, you the one in chains. You think them heroes are gonna share my bounty with you? I don't think so. Hell no, you're here under threat of hanging. You're sure hoping they don't discover what's in your britches. Did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said? How you feel about that, huh? Just 'cause they don't wanna look at you don't mean I can't see. Miss! Missus? I don't know what you want me to call you! You're a sideshow freak! Now, I won't fuckin' stand for this. I'm Tommy fuckin' Walsh! Now, this is bullshit! You let me go! Come on, you think you're innocent? I don't think so. You sittin' on the back of that wagon where I saw you, without a fight, you know what I think? I think that condemns your kind. How you feel about that? Now, you may think that you're free. You may think that. But you'll always be a slave to the white man's biddin'. That's the truth. What'd you call me? I said you'll always be a slave... What'd you call me? I said you'll always be a slave -to the white man's biddin'. -What'd you say? What'd you say? Say it again! Say it again! Say it again. Tired of you running your mouth. Till you been on this side, keep your mouth shut. Every step, y'all wanna bring us down like we're dyin' dogs. You ever see a white man kill your folks? Hang a Black man from a tree because he's in a wrong place at a wrong time? You ever see that? No, didn't see that. -No. -Did not see that. Wanna see it? - I don't wanna see... - You wanna see? I didn't see that. Look, there it is! You ever seen a Black man hang from that tree? For lookin' at a white woman he didn't look at? Or for tryin' to learn how to read? Can't complain. We gotta be grateful. Grateful. Grateful! We gotta be grateful. -Grateful. -Yes, ma'am. For the blisters on our hands. And our empty bellies, and our broken spirits. 'Cause they'd rather hang me for the color of my skin than to hang you for what you did! You ain't never gonna hang, white boy! You hear me? I mean no offense... All right, get up. Real turtle like. We're goin' for a walk. Get my Bible, and find the stagecoach that you robbed. Yes, ma'am. You know, we can't just walk outta here. This is Comanche country. No Bible is that important. Keep walking. You've gotta hope it don't snow. It's gonna dump on us. If it does, I'll, uh... I'll dig you out, haul you back up the hill and I'll bury you by the cross back at the tree. So you ain't alone. How has nobody taken a bullet and put it through your throat to shut you up? They've tried, and they're gonna try again. But, uh... Nah, the thing of being a hero... You know, about the main thing, we ought to know when to die. Prolonged life... It's ruined more men than it ever made. Hey! I do hope you find your Bible. I can see it means somethin' to you. Know any hymns? Oh, sister Let's go down Let's go down Come on down Oh, sister Let's go down Down to the river to pray Oh, sinner Let's go down Let's go down Come on down -Hey! Hey! -Oh, sinner Come back here! Come back here! Hey! Shit. Take it easy now. He means it. I think he means it. I think he means it. I think he means it now. He means it. What the hell you doing, girl? Shoot him! Hmm? You gonna tell me what that paper was? Now that it's gone? Gold claim. Piece of land I had to build a town for my people. A gold claim? Who'd you kill for that? I wanna understand how a woman, such as yourself... Black woman. Yeah. Who's hiding as a man just buys a gold claim. How's that possible? After the war, I couldn't find none of my family but my mom. She went home to be with God. Find peace in death. Made a promise in my heart that I'll honor her. Fight for those that can't fight for themselves. Where's your getaway? You goin' home? I wasn't gonna go back to my master's house, that's for sure. So I put two and two together, and just figured that I'll go cook and clean for them Union boys that set me free. I spent four years watching them soldiers. How they walk, how they talk. Learnt everything I needed to know about them. When they needed people to sign up, I just cut my hair, bought some clothes, and walked on to the army base. Guess nobody was paying attention that day... and signed up and picked up a uniform. Uniform made me feel free. I ain't never been that free in my whole life. I had food, clothing, money in my pocket. Soon enough, they sent us out here to kill people that are couple shades lighter than me. So I left. Took my money and bought that claim. Lot of folks was depending on that claim. You know, I knew it. You have that look of a soldier. That look of not being able to unsee things. I had never met no white boy that could speak Comanche. My wife was Injun. Your wife was what? My wife was Injun. -You got a wife? -Had. I had a kid, too. You know, humankind, uh, can be awfully unkind if it deems that you don't belong. So now, you wanna take revenge on the world? Well... I've been out for revenge on the world since I was eight. Yeah. Cattle barons. They came in, they took my dad and brother from the dinner table. They shot 'em 'cause they wanted our land. It's how I got this. Made Ma sign it over right there before we even finished saying the blessing. I know we all got bad stories to tell, but not everybody takes it out on the world like you. "An eye for an eye," that's what I say. You know, it looks like we believe in the same thing. I guess so. We just go about it in different ways. Let's go about it together. Now, since your gold is gone, how about we strike a deal? Now, you see, that loot from the bank... I'm the only one who knows where it is. You let me go. I dig it up. We split it right down the middle. Right down the middle. White boy, you crazy. That's dirty money. Oh, come on, all money's dirty. All money's dirty. That's not what it's about. It's about bein' free. You think money makes you free? What is it to gain the whole world but lose your soul? Being free is having faith. -My faith is my freedom. -Oh, no, come on. Come on, come on. No. That's just more people telling you what to do, telling you how to think, all the time. Always, always. You can't do nothin'. That's all it is. Money! Money. No matter how much money you get, your heart's gonna still be in the same place. Lonely, sad, broken. You ain't never gonna be free on the inside. That's when you know you're free. We... Listen to me now. Mo. You listen to me now. We deserve it. I'm listenin' to you. -Why should I trust you? -I'm listenin' to you. -Why should I trust you? -Listen. Look at the shit that we've been through. Don't you think we fuckin' deserve it? It's out here? Oh, yeah. It's right here, you can see it from here. Imagine. $40,000. It's ours. You just gotta let me go. Show me where it is first. No, no, no. So you can shoot me in the head and take it for yourself? Come on, I don't think so. No, no, no, no, no. You make a deal with the Devil, you follow Devil's rules. Deal with the Devil? That's right. You and me. You and me. I don't make those kind of deals. Hello? Who's out there? Hey, you come on now. You show yourself! Shut up. Come on. Come here. -Those your boys? Huh? -They are not my boys. They never walk up just flappin' their jaws. Hello? Just a friend. Here to help. You know him? Do you know him? I never seen him before in my life. Don't move. Gal, what you doing out here? Who are you? My name's Will Clay. Take your gun off and toss it. - Now, wait, a man's gun is... - Take off your gun! Of course. Do it real slow. I'll go as slow as I can now. I'm here to help, friend. You all right? That your blood? Ain't none of your business. Relax. Look, I was huntin' there down by my farm when I ran into your people. They the one told me what happened. I just grabbed two of my horse and set out to help. They ain't tell me nothin' about no gal, though. You got them white folk thinkin' you a man. The man that got shot, he all right? The big one taking care of him. I think he'll make it. You don't look dressed for buck huntin'. You don't look dressed for buck huntin' or even farmin'. Yeah, you got me there. Yeah, I do. Embarrassed to admit it, but truth is, uh, I changed my clothes when I heard you was bringin' in the infamous Tommy Walsh. Hmm. That's him, ain't it? I, uh, thought somebody might be here to take my picture. I ain't never had my picture taken before. Ain't no negro farmin' around here. None. Where you from? He sure do ask a lot of questions, don't he? I say you shoot him now, before he takes us out. I'm telling you, you shoot him now. Just like I thought. The Good Lord done brought us together. Givin' you a friend in tryin' times, and givin' us an opportunity. Opportunity? I bet there's a nice little bounty on this here killer. Dead or alive. Now, I say we put him on my horse and go back to the farm. We'll be safe there. I even got a brand new can of coffee. We could ride off in the morning and collect the bounty together. Don't you trust him. He ain't no farmer. He don't live around here. He ain't makin' no coffee. And since you're the man in charge, you take 70%... God damn it, you take these chains off of me. You're as dead as I am. You listening to me? Can I talk to you for a sec? Don't you... Don't you do it. Don't you do it. Don't you listen to him. I, uh... I had a daughter, about your age now. And if she was here... I would ask her what kinda predicament she get herself into. Then, I would help her figure a way out. 'Cause, baby girl, you in dangerous water, pushing away the only boat you got. I don't know what to do. Well, I know he got that loot stashed around here somewhere. I got ways to make him talk. You and I could walk away rich. Be a shame to let the law put their hands on that 120 grand. $120,000? Yes, ma'am. Bank got robbed same day the Union Pacific deposited payroll. You stole $120,000? Hide it out here? You told me to trust you. You can't trust nobody. Trust me. Trust your own kind. It's all you got. Look... I'm here for a reason. You think that man's gonna make it? Absolutely. Got the best doctor in town. What's his name? Woolsey. Come on, man. Woolsey, yeah. You made that up! -Used to labor for him. -Yeah, you're full of shit! You made it up! Nice fella, he is. Wife make the best peach pie in town. God damn it! He's fuckin' lyin' to you! He's a bounty hunter! He's gonna kill you, he's gonna kill me, just like he killed the liquor dealer and that big old bohunk! We should wait for the sheriff. It's the right thing to do. You can wait with me if you want. No. Mm-mm. Suit yourself. I ain't sittin' around here like no duck, waitin' for his men to come pick us off. Now, look, I said I would try to help, but I ain't riskin' my life. You change your mind, my farm is four miles away from here. I'd appreciate you givin' my gun back. Don't you dare. Don't you dare give him that gun back now. God damn it. Don't you do it. Oh, fuck. Well... good luck, gal. You gonna need it. Yeah, you go on now. Go on. Fuckin' huntin' and fuckin' farmin'. Go on. Wait. I ain't never met you before in my life, but your story's addin' up. You mean everything you said? Got the same scars, you and me. You got your forty acre? A mule? You feel free? I sure as hell don't. If I leave him with you, you let me take one of your horses. Hey, hey. Hey, wait. You gonna leave me? You gonna let me go out at the hands of him? You're the reason why we're right here. Now you talkin'. Sound like a good idea to me. In fact, I'll unchain him. No. No. I don't think so. I'll do it. I'll do it. Yeah, suit yourself. What're you waitin' on? Go over here and have me a drink. I can use one after this damn night. Hey, listen to me. Take the gun. Hey. Look at me, look at me. You listen to me now. You listen to me now. Stop, stop. Listen. Listen to me. No. Listen to me. I know killers. He'll kill us both, I swear to you. Mmm. Mr. Field! Some damn good whiskey. Don't worry, I'll save you some, darlin'. For the celebration. You kill those people? Those people, they care nothin' about us. Go on, you shoot him. Go on. Put it down. I've been huntin' him for five months, and I ain't lettin' him get away. Come on, he's gonna kill you. You shoot him! You ain't nothin' but a murderer and a goddamn liar! So are you. Them people got in my goddamn way! I don't know how long I can hold off my desire to blow your head off. Come on. Ain't nobody gettin' in the way of what's owed to me. Least of all you. So, you just gonna have to kill me. Come on, you pull it! Your bullets in the field. On your left! Shoot her! Come here. Come here now. Come here. Should've listened to me, huh? - Come on! Come on! - Should've come with me. Come on, get up. Shit. Hey! You a fuckin' killer? Cut him down! Cut him, God damn it. Cut him! Come on now! Come on, get up! I'll kill you! Here! Oh, shit! You should've trusted me. Now, I know why you did what you did, and I just wish that you didn't. I wanted to trust him. He reminded me of my father. Everybody around you ends up dead, don't they? This is your fault. No, no, no, no, no, no. No. Death follows you, don't it? It follows you. Whether you like it or not, there it is. You think when you get where you're going, it's just gonna disappear? You gonna trade in that six shooter for a dress? No. That imposter will always be knockin' at your door. It will find you wherever you go. Now, you trust me now. I know. It won't be long now. My men are coming. It's in their best interest, of course. I know things they wanna know. They're gonna shoot me just as fast as shoot you if I don't give 'em what they want. And I think you best unchain me now. -Follow you or die? -Huh. I can't stop what's about to happen. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. Being a soldier is deep in my blood. I was the best damn soldier in that battlefield. Better than any man. But I had to learn as a Black woman livin' in this damn white world... that I gotta work three times as hard to get one-fifth of what I deserve, and I'm tired of it. You gonna make me fight for my life and prove that to you? Fine. Watch me set you and your boys alight. Oh, no. Not Dakota. Oh... Oh, Dakota. Oh, boy. I done you wrong, boy. I done you wrong. Tommy. Tommy! We thought they took you to the Brushwood Gulch. Tommy. Tommy. - Tommy. - Where is she? - She? - Where is she? - She? - She's gonna kill us. She? Well, she killed Rufus and Halfbreed. And Dakota, too. What the hell you doin' here, huh? Me go get that bitch! No! No, Pike. Pike. Hold on, Pike. Pike, look what she done. - Nah, you face her! - Hey! Get up. You go and face her right now! I swear to God, she gonna kill you! Go on! She... She went that way. Both of you guys, you get after her right now! You want your money? You bring her back to me! I've had it with you! You don't know the fuck you're dealing with! I know! I've been here! Come on, you get these chains off me now. Come on. Hurry up now. Come on... Thomas, let's get the loot and get outta here. The hell are you doin'? I quit. The hell are you doin'? I waited six months already. That girl don't matter. Just give me what's due, and I'm gone. It's comin' to ya. Yeah? It's comin' to ya. Is that a promise this time? On my life. All right. Ah, shit. Come here, buddy. Here's your hat. Come here, Thomas. Thattaboy. Put that on you now. Let me see ya. You look all right. I'll get your gun. That's a nice gun, Thomas. Yeah. -You'll have to clean it. -Well... You didn't remember to bring the shovels. You out there, little lady? Huh? She's sneaky. Hey. You go on, and I'm gonna circle around. We know you're here! Tuco! Tuco! Where you at? Huh? Where you at, soldier girl? Get up. Oh, look at you. Come here. Get up here! Oh, what are you gonna do with that, huh? Huh? You know, I really thought that you'd have sympathized with a man in chains. Brutalized by the world same way that it brutalized you, but I must have misjudged you. You set your boys on me to take my life. Well, you know what? You killed all of 'em. Just you and me now. I'mma fight for my life by any means necessary. We ain't got no future apart. We don't. You got nothin'. All I got is the gallows, that's it. Now, you listen to me now. Together, I think we could be something. I mean, we could be something that's important, that means something. We could be more than this! More than this! You and me. Tommy Walsh! Tommy Walsh and the Colored Girl. God damn! That's not a headline you heard before. It ain't. What do you think your people will think about that, huh? And you'd be a hero! You'd be a legend in your time! You'd be an inspiration to them. The infamy, the glory of it! Can you imagine? I didn't get a piece of my promised land. Didn't get the rivers flowin' with milk and honey. And I'd never take your deal. Ah, fuck you! Come on! I've given you everything that I got. You have the opportunity now... to take what you deserve, what we both deserve! You gonna have to kill me right here. I'll tell you what, it ain't gonna be easy. No. Not after everything that we've been through. All right. You holster it now. We gonna do this, we're gonna holster it. Come on. There it is. You never asked me my name. You're right. I don't even know your name. Fuck. Wanna know my name? It's Mo Washington. That's my name. Washington. Mo Washington. I'm glad it's at the hands of you. Let me tell you somethin'. Let me tell you somethin'. You... You know where the money is. Your faith is your freedom. Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory... Bag of nails. Lord have mercy. Too late. This one's still alive. We'll see about that. What in bloody hell happened here, son? Tommy's boys, they... they beat me real bad. I got knocked out, and when I woke up, all these dead bodies were here, sir. Killed each other? Killed each other? It's a massacre. Who are all them? That's, uh, Goldie Whitman and Dakota Smitt, Tommy's guys. There's Tommy and the coach driver. But I don't know who these others are. Can't be nobody good if they out here. Tommy say anything about the money, where he hid it? No, sir, he barely talked at all. Mm. You're lucky they didn't kill ya. What ain't you telling us? Well, seems very simple to me. You got a bunch of bad guys over here, a bunch of bad guys over there. They turned on one another, and then killed each other. What do you say, Sheriff? They're dead. Rewards need payin', and lives need livin'. What are you gonna do? Hang this one just for bein' here? I'm sure he don't know what happened. So, we ain't ever gonna know what happened. They all got what they deserve. You think this fella here killed all these men? No man I know could do all that. There's a $10,000 bounty on Tommy Walsh's head. You got that comin' to you, Mr. Wheeler. Do I need to bring these men back into town? Nah. I seen 'em. I suppose, uh, some would hang ya. You suppose right, Sheriff. But I guess it just seems... Well... it seems if there is a God that he wanted you alive. So, just in case, I ain't gonna interfere. But you're gonna clean up this mess. Go get a shovel. You're gonna bury all these bodies, and then be on about your way. And be thankful for it. Yes, sir. That's it? Somewhere around here, he buried all that stolen loot. We just gonna leave it? What are you gonna do? Dig up the whole county? You be my guest. But the rest of you, head back to the saloon, I'm buying. What about the bank loot, Sheriff? Sorry, boys, you heard him. Say goodbye to the money. Good luck, fella. "The meek shall inherit the earth."
