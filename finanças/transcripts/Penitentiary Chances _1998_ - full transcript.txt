- [Voiceover] See (mumbles), it all started out, when me and E were from the same barrio. We used to spray paint on the walls together, beat vatos down, that dared to come into our barrio. It was firme back then, ese. But then it switched up on us, ese, the vida loca holmes got ahold of us. I learned to have no heart, ese, because to have heart, meant to have heartbreaks. The only one thing I loved and cared about, the only thing I had was my carnalito, my little brother. And E? That vato's never been the same ever since his hyna OD'd on some Chiva. So what else is there to do but to make some feria? Who cares if we died, ese? There was no difference. So that's what we started doing. But that's just the way it is, ese. When you take these penitentiary chances. ♫ See through your plastic shells ♫ Something else is on your mind ♫ Ask me how I know ♫ and I'll reply (mumbles) ♫ (mumbles) ♫ (mumbles) drive Mustangs (mumbles) ♫ - Get out the car, holmes. - What's up man, what's up, what's up? (gunshots) (engine revs) (knocking on door) - Come in. What's up? - The murder rate. - [Voiceover] Ah, so you took care of that little motherfucker for me, huh? - Hell yeah, little bitch’s probably surrounded by chalk line by now. - Hey bro, here's your keys. Next time know your friends better before you let ‘em take my shit. - Alright. - Put the phone down, take this. - Hold on. - And give me 1000. Alright, back to business. I got another goddamn fuck that owes me money. I fronted this Mexican kid at the school, two ounces of some A1 shit. These fucking zombies keep coming out of nowhere. I already lost 10,000 last week off these dealers turned dope fiends, so that shit you guys did for me this morning, and the shit you're gonna do for me tonight will show these fucking leeches I ain't no joke. Go back and get me another 1,000, they're gonna do some more shit for us tonight. - Alright. - So we get 1,000 for this morning, and 1,000 for doing what tonight? - Well, this worm I've been trying to tell you about's been avoiding me. He owes me some serious shit, and it's gotten to the point where I'd rather see the motherfucker dead than see my money. - So where are we supposed to find him? - He's at the school late night, hooking up the night school rejects and janitors. You'll recognize him because he wears a hat with the word ant on it. - So, wait a minute, trying to fucking say his name is Ant? - You know Mexicans, ant, spider, crooked, Dyno. - Hey, homes, don't even go there. - No, I'm just playing, but you guys can do that shit for me tonight? - Where's the feria? - Right here. Is it a deal? - Consider it done, ese. - [Voiceover] Alright. - You guys take it easy. - I'll check you out later. - Alright. - [Voiceover] Que pasa little Bugsy? - [Voiceover] Ah you came through with some pizza man? - [Voiceover] (mumbles) I got you a hat holmes. - Thanks man. - Me and your brother, we got a new jale so we're being cool here for awhile. No more Top Ramen, shit. - What kind of job man? - The kind of job that puts food in our mouths. - Just askin' man. - Get some holmes. I didn't mean it like that. It's a long story but we work for some white boy downtown. - Whatever pays the bills. - Yeah, how are the homeboys doing? - They're doing cool, eh. They raided five houses last night though. - Nah, stay trucha, holmes. That vato’s still starting pleito down the block? - Fuck nah. - Because they know who's carnalito you are, huh? - Yep. - Damn, so what you getting into tonight? - We'll probably go over Duke's house. He’s got that new Andre Nickatina Album. Probably bump that for awhile and watch a new Scarface movie. - That one with Tony Montana's brother? Percy Montana. - Yeah, eh, don't watch that movie. That movie sucks, eh. For reals, eh look, I watched that movie myself and as far as I'm concerned, the only difference between that one and the first one is what, it's filmed in some funny place, New Orleans, some shit like that. - How can that shit suck if everybody I know is watching it though, man? Anyways, what you guys gonna do tonight, eh? - Make some more money. - For that white boy? - Yeah, for that white boy. - What's up, partners, can I hook y'all up with something? - Hell yeah, cabron, hook us up with a couple of ounces. - What, what's all this? - Look, you owe somebody some money so why don't you just pay us? - Hey man, that's between me and Big Jon. - Hey look, eh, who gives a fuck it's between, break yourself. - What you got, holmes? - I told you partner, I ain't got any money. - Fuck that, I just saw that motherfucker pay you something. Why don't you pull out what you got in your pocket. Fucking food stamp. - That's all the man had, I sold him a five sack. - Look Holmes, I'm tired of playing games, where's Big Jon's money at? - I told you, I ain't got any money. Why y'all trying to get crazy with me for? You’re selling out your own people. I'm just like you. - Man you ain't like me, holmes. You ain't my fucking people, fucking dope fiend. - Look holmes, don't even play that brown pride with me. You ain’t worth a shit - Hey man, you best not point a gun unless you're gonna kill me. - (laughs) Who said I wasn't. (gunshots) (phone rings) - State your business. Oh, what's up Big Jon? Yeah, he didn't have any money. I was just trying to get something out of him, you know what I'm saying? Eh, that money sounds good but what do you want done? At noon, huh? Yeah, I guess we can make it. Alright man, nah, I understand. I'll see you then, peace. Hey Loco wake up, man. Wake up. - Nah-ah. - Loco, wake up, man. Get up. - What the hell you want, Dyno? It's so early. - Hella early, it's 11:00 already, man. We got to be at the office, Big Jon wants us at the office in an hour. Come on, we got to get dressed. Serious - What for? - He didn't want, he didn't say. He didn't want to say, I don't know. He just mentioned three Gs. - Three Gs. - Got you up quick, que no. - Yeah, (mumbles). Three Gs, bro. That's a lot of money. We could be going into business for ourselves in no time. - That's what I'm talking about, eh. I'm tired of working for that white boy, que no. - Yeah. - I mean, you know, that dope fiend man that we blasted, eh, all that stuff he was saying about selling out and brown pride and everything got me hella mad, eh. - Hell yeah, me too, shit. - But you know what, it was like we should be working for ourselves though. We should be running this game. - Who knows, from the get go. Shit, you know what eh, that fucking white mother fucking skinhead, Aryan looking like mother fucker, damn fucking make me so mad. I think he's a fucking undercover racist and you know what, fuck that. - That's what I'm saying. You know what, holmes, we're gonna milk that fool, man. We're gonna take everything he's got and me and you are gonna takeover that spot, que no. - Simone. - Let's get up, eh. - Alright. - I don't know why you trust these fucking Mexicans. - Because they'll do anything for practically pennies. - You mean pesos, bro. - Exactly, those fools ain't tripping. They'll do whatever I tell 'em for a little bit of money flashed in their faces. Besides, a spic ain't nothing but a bilingual nigger. (laughs) (knock at door) Go get that, it's probably them. - The bilingual (huh?), they speak ebonics in Spanish? - What's up, Big Jon. - [Voiceover] Hey, how you boys doing? - Alright, alright. - [Voiceover] Have a seat. - Hey, what's up? - I want to thank you guys for that shit you guys did for me last night, but I got a new problem. These guys are in town called the Mongo brothers, they expect me to give them $10,000 for a kilo. I need you guys to meet 'em at 6:00 and pick up the shit. - Alright, alright. So where we supposed to meet these fools at? - You know that parking spot over on Shermstick Ave.? - Yeah, ain't that by Jessica's taco truck, right? - Right, well Sunday it's empty and that's where you guys are gonna meet him at. - So all we got to do is hand 'em $10,000? - No, you're gonna act like you give him 10,000, you're gonna pop 'em like a bitch's cherry, you're gonna bring me my money and my dope and I'm gonna give you guys 3000 a piece. - What's up? You Big Jon's boys? - Yeah, aren't you guys Mango brothers? - That's Mongo. - Holmes. - Mongo. - Anyways, you guys got the shit? - Yeah, it's right here, you got the money? - Right here. - Let me have it. - Let you have it? - Let me have it? - Alright. (gunshots) - Oh shit, hey Dyno. - What is it? - [Voiceover] So what do you think we should do, eh? - We got two choices here, either give this to Big Jon and hopefully he'll break us off something or we'll just break it into ounces ourselves. - You know what, I don't think there is a choice. I mean we're supposed to be going into business for ourselves, que no. And forgetting that gavacho. - Well I might as well just start making some calls trying to move this. You know what, Black Sam, holmes. - You should call that fool up. - Hell yeah, let me call him up real quick. - What the fuck that fool's talking about. - Yeah, hello Sam? Yeah, what's up, homeboy, it's Dyno. Yeah, you know, just trying to get my money straight. Hey, I got a little proposition for you. I got a key of CR, holmes. Yeah, I was wondering if you still got that homeboy that, you know, remember? Yeah, hell yeah, it's the bomb, holmes. - Tell him it's that shit fucking smells. - It's that one that smells. Remember the one we had last year? That one. Yeah. No, I can't wait that long, holmes. I need this done today. Alright holmes, it's all good, eh. Yeah, talk to you later, man. Damn, he said he'll need at least a week. - We don't got a week. Damn, I know somebody else. - Who? - That one vato, Crooked, give him a call. He's always trying to make some quick feria. - Yeah, holmes, I don;t know his number, what the hell's his number. - Hold up, it's 867-, - Wait, wait. - 5309. - Okay. Yeah, what's up, Crooked? Yeah, I'm just trying to come up a little, you know? - (whispers). - Hey, E said what's up eh. Right, right. Check it out, man, I got a kilo of some CR. I need to get rid of it, man, but I need to get rid of it either today or at the latest tomorrow and I'll give you half the profit. Hell yeah, man, hell yeah. Eh man, it's pure white, it's hella clean. Cracks back and everything, man. It's for shooters too, man, it dissolves good in water. Hell yeah. Yeah, that's fine by me, eh. Alright, homeboy. Yeah, see you at 10, eh. It's all good, eh. - That's what I'm saying. - Check it out though. He said it's all good, the only thing is we got to break it down into ounces, so go ahead and grab the triple beam, holmes. - Alright. - [Dyno] Handle this. - Let's do this.
