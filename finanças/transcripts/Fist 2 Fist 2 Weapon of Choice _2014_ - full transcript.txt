(film reel clicking) (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (radio chattering) - [Man] Can't you go a little faster, I'm gonna be fucking late. - [Taxi Driver] Relax, we'll be there. I'm going as fast as I can pal, don't have a heart attack. It's like 20 minutes. - 20 minutes? - [Taxi Driver] You alright? - I just can't be late to this. I'm getting out. Pull over, I'm getting out. - Ah jeez. (horn blares) (laughing) (relaxed music) - [Man] Hey, it's Chubby. - [Men Together] Chubby! - [Man] Have a seat. (laughing) - You want cake? - Hey she asked if I'm ready for my cake. (men laugh) - [Men Together] Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake. Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake. Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake. (laughing) (lighter sparking) (laughing) (cheering) (blowing) (clapping) (suspenseful music) (laughing) (dramatic music) (groaning) (gun firing) (screams) (groaning) (gasps) (whimpering) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (groans) (screams) (melancholy music) - Tell your boss what happened here today. Make nothing up, leave nothing out. My part of the deal is done, not it's his turn. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (tinny dance music) (door slamming) - Hey. - So what do you want for dinner? I'm cooking. - [Jack] Really? What's the occasion? - I just feel like it. - [Jack] You not going out tonight? - Nah, they want me to but I don't really feel like it. It's been a long week. - You're not still moping over Rob are you? - No, I'm done with him. I just feel like staying in, that's all. - You're sure nothing's going on. - (sighs) Nothing is going on. I am offering you fresh cooked food. Dutiful Asian daughter and all that shit. What's not to like? - Okay, let me think. - Do you want me out? - What do you mean? - Ooh is somebody coming over maybe? Is that it? - No. - Oh, that's disappointing. I never want you to use me as an excuse not to, you know. - [Jack] What? - Bring someone home with you, that you like. - It's been a long week too. Let's make dinner. - Don't forget we have the councilor meeting on Monday. - [Jack] You bet. - We still can't tell them you're really my uncle? - You know the drill. - Alright, I just think it'd be cool that's all. It would make me more exotic. You're a gorgeous, young Korean American. Piano virtuoso getting a full scholarship to Juilliard. And a multiple black belt. You wanna be more exotic? - Boring, boring, boring. You want some tea? - Yeah. (suspenseful music) (gasps) (glass smashing) (groans) Jaime? (groaning) Jaime! (groaning) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (screams) (yells) (gun fires) (groans) (groaning) (melancholy music) Dono? What the hell is this? - Hey Jack. Long time no see. How you been? - Good. How about you? - Day started off good. Had a really great dump this morning. - Where did they take her? - I'm just a soldier man, you know that. - I know your Michael's guy. Where? - If I tell you Michael kills me. - That's right, what's the code? You fail, you die. Michael will kill you, slow. I'll make it quick. I liked you. You used to make me laugh. - Jesus Jack. You worked for Michael once. What do you expect me to do? - Come on. Go on. Say it. - Don's Restaurant 18th and Harrison, in the city. (phone buzzing) - [Guard] Talk to me. - Put Michael on. - [Guard] Who the fuck is this? - Jack Lee, put him on. - [Michael] Dono, I hope you ain't fucking with me. - Why'd you take Jaime? - [Michael] Jack. - We had a deal. - [Michael] A deal, right. Well the deal on the premise that your brother in laws death was permanent. - It can't be. - [Michael] Oh a beautiful place he's got down there in Florida, right on the coast. You know you can see all the oil spills in the Gulf right from his desk. Five million can buy an awful lot of property, so tell me, why didn't you get one yourself. - I didn't know, I wasn't in on it. - [Michael] (laughs) Who do you think you're talking to? I know you guys weren't the tightest but come on, you were married to his fucking sister. You know that was a beautiful plan that you come with. You fooled me. I mean you really fooled me. - Why Jaime? She's got nothing to do with this. - [Michael] I'm out five million and I need some merchandise to sell to recover that. Something of great value. - I made it square with you. I hit Z for you. That settled it. - [Michael] You made it square for Harry stealing five million from me. Money I thought was lost. But since he faked his death, all deals are off. And the both of you are gonna pay. The pay being different. - You want ransom? How much? - [Michael] Oh this is much bigger than that. Just know that she'll be taken care of. In very good hands, we can promise you that. - You deal with me! You don't take Jaime! - A professional hit. And they lost. Koehler here yet? - Don't think so. - Is he coming? I don't wanna have to repeat anything to him. I know I have to work with him, I am just tired of always waiting. (camera clicks) Did they find out who lives here? - Father and daughter. Asian, kept to themselves the most part. Only thing a noise complaint a couple of years ago. Turns out it was a sweet sixteen for the daughter and some of her friends. You know, normal stuff. - [Ash] Do we know where they are? - I don't know. - Never fear the FBI is here. Okay, let's get this show on the road. We haven't met, Hap Koehler, Special Agent FBI. Detective Ashley Jordan, how are you this fine evening? I want a full report. - Three dead. - Neighbor saw a car leaving the garage after all this went down. - Call in an APB. - Yes sir. - Well, well, well what have we got here? - Plenty here is your caretaker. You be nice to him, he'll be nice to you. You piss him off, he'll hurt you, got that? - Got it. - I'm not talking to you. You hear me? - I'm not stupid. I'm not gonna get my head blown off by one of you motherfuckers. I don't know where I am, I don't know how the fuck to get out of here. So I'll do what you want. I'll obey, I'll be compliant. Except for just one thing. If you try to rape me, I will fucking kill you in any way that I can, and I won't care what happens to me after it! And if you hurt me, you kill me, my Uncle Jack will make sure that you live long enough to see your heart ripped from your own chest. (exhales) Okay. - Jesus Christ. (door slams) - [Radio Officer] White Honda has been spotted. License plate Alpha Omega Charlie Eighth Six Eight. Repeat Alpha Omega Charlie Eighth Six Eight. - [Radio Officer] Okay we have 42 coming out over the hit and run you might wait for him. - [Radio Officer] Will do. - I know this guy. Dono Marro, one of Michael Banducci's men. - You sure? - Been tracking him since the first day I got this case. That means everyone else here is a Banducci man. That's good. I can clean out my database, it was getting pretty cluttered. - [Radio Officer] Suspect is in custody. - [Radio Officer] 480 at Douglas, permission to 20 flash. - [Radio Officer] North on two-one we got this. - [Radio Officer] 10 six. - I'll make you a bet. Ballistics will match every weapon in there with a bullet in each of those bodies. And those bodies will be found to be the owners of the guns. - Meaning? - You're intrigued right? - Meaning? - Meaning, maybe we should discuss this case further over drinks? (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) Koehler. Ash! Patrol car found our man in the city. (suspenseful music) - Fuck this jurisdiction shit. I am sick of your goddamn political bullshit. - You need to calm down. - We are not your fucking lackeys. We led you to Bendu Chief, we gave you all his locations, all his contacts, all his bank accounts, you took it and you put it in your precious little database and you keep taking all the credit for it. And I am sick of it. You can't have him. - We're on this together. We're the ones with the resources. You got a safe house where we can take him? - Yes it's called jail. - Oh jee. You're way out of line, you know that lady? I think maybe you need some time off. You can force for me to pull rank on you. I can throw you off this case, is that what you want? Look, we take him to a safe house, you're there with us and I'll debrief you on Jack Lee. Trust me detective. You have no idea what you're up against here. What's your answer? - Do it. (suspenseful music) - I tell you, she's like that girl from The Exorcist movie. I was waiting for the green gunk in my eye. - What are you getting soft on me? She's 17 for Christ sake. - We've got her no problem, and cops got Jack, can you believe that? We watched the whole bust out of the front window. - Yeah, we'll deal with that next. Who's watching her now? - Testo and The Machine. - The heat got Jack right outside our fucking door. They're gonna be back to look around. Have them take her to the warehouse and babysit until we get there okay? - Done. - What's the code? - Failure is not an option. - Now say it the right way. - You fail, you die. - Okay, next item on the agenda. - What agenda? - Jack. - Oh, we'll get him. - SFPD owns him now, unless he does something about it. If you want him, you've gotta go through them first. Yeah I thought so. It's time you met somebody. Pull the car around. (relaxed music) - What is it a Chinese medicine or something? - Patience trust me. (suspenseful music) (door knocking) - [San] Michael Banducci, enter Senor. - Thank you, good to see you. - Please. My nephews Alejandro, Diego, my sisters sons. They've come into the business. - We have not needed your special services in quite a while now as my business has been stable and growing. - I take it a pleasure to hear that. I'm sorry things are different now huh? - A single issue only and you can help me with that. I want only the best you have to offer, as we will need it. - Consider the fee paid, in full. As it happens the best is here with us as we are speak. Let me introduce Diego to you. My nephew, a Navy Seal. Can you believe it? - I feel better now, we're in good hands. You hungry? - Sure. - What do you feel like? - Oh let's see we had Italian last night. - How about, I don't know, Chinese. - Yes sure, that sounds good. What? - Think back, six years now. A little job I sent you on for a client. You were there only to report what you saw, as an objective and trusted third party. Do you recall this? Tell me everything you remember of that night, can you do that? - Yes. I remember everything, as if it were just yesterday. I wish I could just forget. (suspenseful music) - Open the door. - I always open it. - Open the fucking door. (footsteps thudding) (inhales) (groaning) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) That'll teach you, you little fucking cunt. Where you going to run to now huh? (door slams) (sobbing) - Hey babe, it's your favorite girl. I'm maybe 20 miles out. - Can y'all see me from your station? - [Johnson] 10 four. - I could head over later, that is, if you're not doing anything. - Johnson. - [Johnson] Go ahead. - Stay there. - [Johnson] Copy that. - See you soon, love you. - Six years ago, the gang boss known as Z was muscling in on Michael Banducci's territory and operations. On the night of July 7th, they shut him down, hard. All the bullets and casings that were harvested from the crime scene matched the weapons of all of the victims. On that alone it would appear that they just decided to kill themselves for the hell of it. It must've been a pretty lousy birthday party. (laughing) Banducci arranged the hit, that's a no brainer. But there's never been any evidence to link him to it. The case went very cold, very fast and it's stayed that way ever since. Then last night, when I saw what went down at the home of Jack Lee, I recognized something that I hadn't seen since the Z killings. The victims weapons were all taken and turned upon 'em. All of the victims were Banducci's men. Shortly thereafter we picked up Jack Lee casing Don's Restaurant. A front for Banducci run by his ace boon goon Dimitri Don Orloff. Can you feel it? - [Officers Together] Yeah, we can feel it. - Yeah. Jack Lee is sitting in there waiting for us to have a conversation with him. If he's a $25,000 a year security guard, I'm the Shah Of Iran. We get him to tell us that Banducci hired him to do the Z hit, we can prosecute. I've waited six years for this, okay. You're welcome to stay if you want but there's not really anything for you to do. I'll keep you updated on any new developments. - I wanna review the photos, is that okay with you? - Passwords ghost, all lowercase. (suspenseful music) (door knocking) - I'm not here to interrogate you. Where's your daughter? No tricks. I am just honestly concerned. - What are you doing? You are here at my sole discretion. Do we need to have that discussion about jurisdiction. (gun firing) (groans) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) - Do you have a car? - Yes. - Front or back? - Front. Let's go. (suspenseful music) Drop to the ground. Drop to the ground! On the ground now, hands spread. (groaning) (dramatic music) (gun firing) - [Jack] The snipers on the East Side. - What are you doing? - [Jack] I'll draw 'em out, if you're quick. (gun firing) (groans) (moaning) - There's a hospital 10 minutes away from here. - No. They found me here, they'll find me there. - You need to let me go. - I have to find Jaime. - Then she is alive? - I die, she dies. I'll tell you everything you wanna know, I'll give you Banducci. Give him up. - Come on, come on, let's go. (suspenseful music) (engine revving) (wood clacking) (groaning) - Hi there, welcome. - Good to see you again Tashir son. - If you'll excuse me. - Okay. You've kept me on the hook for quite a while now. - What do you mean? - My warehouse, my entire operations, you know the work of it. My offer still stands. My retirements calling to me louder every day. - I've been following your growth, as if I've always been an investor. - Well I'm flattered. You would've seen an excellent return on your investment. - I have particular appreciated your escort services. Executive class all the way. - Thank you. - And I'm also very impressed by your shipping operations. You've become the Fed Ex of the contraband haven't you? - (laughs) Then you know the worth of my operation. - Indeed, and it would supplement my activities really well. Your price has always been reasonable and I will pay when I am ready too, but I am not yet ready. - Well I may have something that will make you feel you are ready. - I'm intrigued. - Six years ago when you were just starting your trafficking operation and wanted girls of distinction, I offered you one. - She was Korean and very young wasn't she? - That's right. Long story short, she became a bargain chip to another problem I had and that chip has been used. - Have you found one of the same caliber? - Actually, it's the same one. She's back on the market and as I recall you don't like to pick prematurely from the vine, you appreciate a fruit that had time to ripen. - You have a good memory. - Well she's 17 now and she's become a very fine wine. - And has the bottle been opened? - I would assume so, kids these days, but the bottle is full. - I presumed she has not yet been bargained. - No she has not and I warn you, she's wild, extremely so. - That's a, this might indeed close our deal. - I'd like to arrange a showing at your convenience, I'm supremely confident you'll be very pleased. - Your offer is most generous, I shall be pursuing this matter. - Well consider it a bonus and my gift to seal the deal. It's looking really good. Figure out where you'd like to live for the rest of your life, maybe a tropical island someplace like that. Someplace you can park your yacht. You know, your smaller yacht. Okay, unfinished business, where did San Testaban say? - Well he's making noises that we didn't tell him it wasn't just Jack. - It was just Jack. - Turns out there was another person they had to fight too. - So fucking what? - The contract says one. - Bullshit. Alright we've gotta send him a message. What's his cousins name? - Nephew, Diego. - Whatever. I want you to find him, slap him around a bit, leave some marks. Send him back to Testaban with a message that I expect this work to be completed or we've got a very serious problem. - Done. - [Oliver] Ash, he's awake. - Jack, can you hear me? - Where the hell am I? - [Ash] My brother Oliver's house. He's taking care of you. - Your brother? - Adopted. - How long? - Well since the orphanage and then I came, oh, about two days. No, you can't, no good. You've gotta stay flat as a board. - Rest now, you're in good hands. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Are you comfortable? Taken care of? - Yes. - Look, we got off on the wrong foot, but you've been behaving, I'd like to reward that. Do you remember me? You were about so. Cute as a bud. Already a real looker. Your father worked for me back then, I mean your real father Harry. Call me Uncle Michael, I'd like that. - Okay, Uncle Michael. - Now Jaime you like nice clothes don't you? Oh then you're just gonna love what we've got for you. You do as you're told, everyone has an enjoyable evening and we see about getting you back home safe and sound to Uncle Jack. How's the sound? - What do you want me to do? - Oh no, no, no, nothing like that. I can find plenty of girls to put out. I just need you to be a beautiful, charming hostess to impress a very important guy. Can you do that for Uncle Michael? - Okay. - Terrific. (suspenseful music) See that? Kill 'em with kindness and they eat right out of your hand. Bitches are all the same. - Did you mean what you said in there? Are you gonna let her go? - What the fuck do you think I'm gonna do? - Well, I dunno, I figured maybe like... - I swear, the next guy I hire has to be a college graduate, I can't take this shit anymore. - Man, his ass is so tight only frogs in Peru could hear him fart. - [Oliver] Come on Jack just a little further. - Outside. - No man, this window's gonna be all the outside you get. Come on. He's got about an hour until his next pain meds and then he's gonna probably pass out. - Are you ready for some show and tell? Koehler kept everything about Banducci on this. I've had the last few days to figure it all out. Who is Harry Mason? I've helped you no? And we had a deal. - Yes you have. - Your brother in law? You may not like what I'm going to show you next. (suspenseful music) Did you know? Harry Mason was married to Alexa Lee, your sister. She's deceased? - Car accident. - Suspicious? - Drinking problem. - They had a daughter, Alicia, she disappeared right after Harry's death. No trace. She's Jaime isn't she? Tell me about this. (suspenseful music) - [Jack] Harry kept the books for the Banducci operations. Over several years he siphoned off five million and disappeared. Banducci grabbed Jaime as leverage against Harry, he figured he'd only come back for her. He didn't. A month later it looked like Harry bought it in an arm's heist gone wrong. Big explosion. (explosion booms) Lots of blood. They ID'd Harry by some loose teeth. After than Banducci had no more use for the girl. He would've killed or trafficked her. I made a deal to get her back. - You hit Z, take out his rival, he gives you Jaime? Banducci kept his end of the deal? - We disappeared, Jaime picked a new name. Those were good times. A second chance. Then they found Harry still alive, Michael thought I knew. I didn't. I thought he was dead too. After all these years. (people chatter) (dance music thudding) (groaning) (dramatic music) (groaning) (gun pops) (gun firing) (glass smashing) - What's happening? - She's worried. Just trying to work it out for herself you know. - So am I. - I think it's you. She says your some kind of ninja, assassin, killer, hitman, dude. She said you saved her life. - She saved mine. - Did she tell you, I'm not a doctor. (laughs) - What the hell are you? - I'm a veterinarian. Horses and dogs mostly. - Oh shit. - Don't worry man, I learned the same shit as those people stitchers did. Hey, hey man watch it. You don't know what you're missing dude. (exhales) (suspenseful music) - I like this gun. Fits my hand like it's molded for it. - [Jack] Koehler had good taste. - You never come with a weapon, so nothing can be traced to you. - And nothing can ever be taken away from me. - You have to know how to use every weapon. - In my line, whether you live or die depends on your weapon of choice. Can I get my phone back? It's the only way Jaime can reach me. - I found it in Koehler's case, I'll give it to you. - Thank you. - Alright what happened? - It got a little out of hand. - I didn't tell you to kill the fucker. Slap him around is what I said, okay. - That's exactly what I was doing. He knew the rules. - Oh Christ. - Put the weapons down. Then he pulls a blade. - You're bringing the heat on us, you know that? - Only his brother knows, he ain't going talk. - What am I gonna say to San Testaban? This Diego was his cousin. - Nephew. - Whatever! There's a big fat fucking difference between slapping a guy around and putting him down. - He came at me for the kill. - Hmm-mm. Him with a knife, you with a gun. Was there something going on between you two? - I caught Candy with him at the club. So we had a little altercation. His big brother stopped us from settling things, so things ain't settled if you know what I mean. - That's it? He was taking home one of your stripper girlfriends? - She was special. - I bet she was. Not like the others. - That's right. - She fooled you. - What? - You're a bonehead, but you're not that stupid. I was fucking her too. Was there anything else going on? - I was doing his girlfriend too, that's all. - Ah Jesus. - I didn't know she was his girlfriend at the time. (suspenseful music) Alright yeah, I knew. - Hmm, goddammit. (cheerful music) (sighs) - For me? - It should fit. How are you feeling? - A thousand times better than yesterday. - My grandfather always used to say afternoon naps killed everything except an appetite. It should be ready in about 15 minutes. - Where are we going? Am I under arrest? - Sure, why not. I always let someone in my custody run straight into sniper fire and then I follow guns blazing. - It works every time. - You were hit. - Only once, thanks to you. Thank you. (water splashing) - You're not under arrest. Because I'm not a cop anymore. I stopped being a cop when we drove away from the crime scene. It was a long time coming. - [Jack] Why did you? - I didn't dislike Koehler because he was such a doofus, I was burned out and he could see. And I hated that he knew that about me. - What will you do now? - Finish making dinner. After that, anybody's guess. If I wasn't a cop, I would've loved to have been a ballroom dancer. - May I have this dance? (upbeat cheerful music) (peaceful romantic music) I can dance to this too. - Can you now? - I failed her. I failed at being a good father. - The last six years prove different. - [Man] We found him. Confirmed it's them. What do you want us to do? Check. (suspenseful music) (moaning) (sighs) (suspenseful music) - Jack! (groaning) (dramatic music) (screams) (groaning) (guns firing) (groaning) (gun fires) (groaning) (screaming) (bones cracking) (groaning) (yelling) (sobbing) (suspenseful music) - [Jack] Who sent you? If you wanna live you talk. Who sent you? - San Testaban. - [Jack] Working with Banducci? - Don't know. I'm just a soldier. - [Jack] Of course. Where is San Testaban these days? (groaning) (screaming) - Alright, alright. 88 Grant, Chinatown. - [Ash] What's San Testaban's connection to Banducci? - He's freelance. Custom services. No loyalty. He'll take a job for anyone as long as money's right. - You've met him? - No, but I've heard of him. He's a recluse. But he's got his hands in everything. The FBI have used his service before. It explains how they found us at the safe house. I'll go alone. - I'm going with you. - I'm faster alone. - I'm not asking permission. I'll keep up, deal? - I can't worry about you. - Don't. - Tie him up, even if his arm falls off. - I'm proud of you brother. - Hey man. You into weed at all? (whistles) - 72 Chevy Nova 350 38. - It's my baby. Upgraded it's cam intake, the carb, dual exhaust. - Sweet. Where have you been all my life? - Waiting for you. (upbeat rock music) - Get all the regulars out of here by one. Given them their bonuses and tell 'em the boss is real happy with their productivity. - Okay, I'll tell 'em. - Tashir's gonna be here at three, so if she decides to act up today you deal with her. And no messing her up in any way. No cuts, no bruises, no black eyes, you got it? - Say what? - I've been keeping you in the loop haven't I? Tashir is our cash cow and he's about to make you very, very rich. I've been trying to make this deal with him forever. And now we finally got the sweetener that's gonna close it. Our beautiful little honey pot. On paper it's gonna look like just another legitimate real estate deal, but what he's getting is my entire fucking operation. My life's work, for a cool million Benjamins. You got any idea what that gets you? We'll have more money than we know what to do with. Live like Kings for the rest of our lucky fucking lives. But it's all riding on the sweet little snatch in there. She's gotta be absolutely perfect. No damaged goods. Not even a scratch. Now you got it? - I got it. - What's the code? - I got it. - What's the code? - [Delivery Man] Someone order a dress. - Alright it's here. - The tailor is not. (clears throat) - What the fuck do you want? - Excuse me? Hi, I'm the stylist hair, face and nails. You Michael? (engine revving) - [Ash] This is the address. It's just shops, where is he supposed to be. - He said inside. Like a rat in a sewer. They live like a maze. - What now? (relaxed music) (laughs) - I found a way in. (engine revving) (peaceful music) - Good faith to our remaining venture. - This is the most generous gift Tashir son. I'm deeply humbled. - Bullshit. (peaceful music) - Lose the dress. - No. - Lose the goddamn dress. - Lose the fucking dress. - No. (groaning) (dramatic music) (bones cracking) (screaming) (groaning) (clapping) - [Tashir] Magnificent. (sword clangs) - Take her back. - We got a deal. - Alright. (door knocking) - It's Chubby. Shit. (screams) (dramatic music) - Let him go. Your problem is with me. - My problem is with Banducci. - Then why come here? Go to Banducci. - You're going to take me to him. - No, I do not betray clients. (speaking in foreign language) - They come to me always, 'cause everyone knows that. (speaking in foreign language) - Point it at me, I'm the boss here. (speaking in foreign language) - (speaking in foreign language), I ask for mercy. (suspenseful music) (speaking in foreign language) I am humbled. I will not forget this. - Banducci has my niece. Your assignment on me is unjust. - I no longer work for Banducci, I will return his payment. - Even though he killed your nephew? Chubby told me. - Don't confuse today with what will happen tomorrow. Emotion and business do not mix. A time will come, of my own choosing, and my Diego will be avenged. - Tell me where Banducci is? - On the graves of all my ancestor's I do not know. They come to me, always. 'Cause everyone knows that. I guarantee you safe passage from here. Should we meet again, there'll be no legacy between us. Okay, okay, okay. You alright? Yeah. Alright. - I wouldn't let her do that to me. (suspenseful music) - I need your help, I know where Banducci is. - [Don] Come on let's go play cards, the boys are waiting. - Why are the boys even here? Why? - Michael wants some back up. - Yeah I can do the back up. I can do the forward, I can do all that shit. - Shut the fuck up. (suspenseful music) - The money will be here at 6:00 a.m., I'll be here at 6:30 and we'll close the deal. - Fantastic, see you tomorrow. Figure out which island you wanna live on yet? - Yeah, Long. - Excuse me? - Long Island. - That's your choice, Long Island? - It's where my family is. Call San Testaban, I wanna hear that Jack is dead and gone okay. - Shit, must have dropped it while wrestling with the bitch. - Well go get it. - Getting it. - Simple people. (suspenseful music) - This is what I do best. Alone. - You can't fight Banducci and get Jaime out at the same time. I'm looking forward to meeting her. Getting to know her. How are we gonna get in? - Got a crowbar? - In the trunk. - That will do. (groaning) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - Titanium.
