- The virus has begun to spread out of the east, quickly making its way overseas. Scientists have confirmed human to human transmission. They are unsure of the exact number of infections, or if it has made its way to American soil. The World Health Organization is asking everyone to stay home. As some people are concerned about loss of income, many others are dealing with mental illness. The new study is warning that the next health crisis, isolation and the anxiety from the lockdown, may actually be a wave of suicide. - Thank you. Hey, baby. Aw. Hey, girl. Hey boo, you get in okay? - I actually just walked in. How was your flight? - Yeah well, my flight was okay, quiet. Just long. Kitty happy to see you? - Yeah. Well, he seems pretty happy. I think he's just kind of missing me a little bit, so I'll have to give him some love. He just ran off. - Of course, girl. Thank you for looking after him, I appreciate it. I did end up finding your stash, so I got stoned and made some cookies. - You're such a little pot head. Big day tomorrow. - Yeah, well hey, you're gonna do great. Just call me and let me know how it goes, okay? Will do. - All right. - Talk to you soon. - Okay, bye. Hey, Dad. - Baby girl, how's it going, kiddo? - Good, good, how about you? - Oh you know, same shit, different day. I'm hoping to stop by this week. Are you gonna be in town a bit? - Yeah, yup, I just got home today, actually. I was only gone for a few days this time. - Okay, you're going around so much, you must be really digging that new job then. - Well, it's been going pretty good, I like it. The pay is good and the assignments are fun. So can't complain. - Well that's great, So you'll be buying lunch then. My treat, yes. - Looking forward to catching up with you, hon. - All right Dad, sounds good. - Bye. - Bye. ♪ Heart to heart and head to head ♪ ♪ Everything I never said ♪ ♪ Lay me down and I will make my bed ♪ ♪ But I won't go away ♪ ♪ Shut me down or shut me up ♪ ♪ You know all I ever wanted was just a ♪ ♪ Chance to bare my bones, my blood ♪ ♪ But you look the other way ♪ - The virus has begun to spread out of the east, quickly making its way overseas. Scientists have confirmed human to human transmission. They are unsure of the exact number of infections, or if it has made its way to American soil. At this time, the CDC is recommending that anyone who has traveled abroad within the last seven to 14 days, be aware of the following symptoms. Fever, dizziness, fatigue, dry cough. Headache. - Are you hungry? - Hey. Girl, have you heard about his virus shit or what? - Well yeah, sort of. I don't know, it's just crazy. It seems like it just came out of nowhere and we don't even know how or why. - Girl, you know it's always something. I mean last year, it was the measles returning, and then it was the bird flu. And you know the media is full of shit anyways. So don't trip out, okay? You're right. I don't know, it just seems different for some reason. - Look, I will reach out to Nate. I've been meaning to catch up with him anyways and he lives for this kind of thing. Yeah. - Yeah, just don't freak out, I'm sure it's nothing. Cool. Definitely let me know what he says. Thanks, love. - All right, bye. That girl. Random. Okay. Hey. - So did you talk to Nate? - I texted him. He doesn't seem to think it's a big deal, really. Yup, basically it's just a really nasty, respiratory illness and no zombies or anything yet. Hmm. Well, it seems to be making people really sick. And the weird thing about it is every news outlet seems to be confused about the facts. There really isn't even any solid information yet. - The news just wants to freak you out and create fear and they care about ratings, all right? Yeah. I went to the grocery store today and people were literally buying up all the toilet paper and the water like we were headed into some kind of nuclear holocaust. - See, isn't it just a little bizarre that it's out of nowhere? No, I mean, it was a little unnerving to be honest, but-- - You were just traveling, too. I'd be getting checked out if I were you. - Look, uh-uh, no no, don't start with all that. I just stayed domestic and I feel fine. Yeah, I'm not trying to get all worked up about some shit we know nothing about. Really. - Sorry. I just worry, you know that. - Just take it easy, okay hon? I'll call you tomorrow, okay? - Okay, night. - Cheers, good night. The virus has begun to spread out of the east, quickly making its way overseas. Scientists have confirmed human to human transmission. - What to believe during times like these? Are we overreacting, are we not doing enough? I feel so confused. Alone with my thoughts. I just need to tune everything out to feel normal. I know this is all temporary, I think. At this time, the CDC is recommending that anyone who has traveled abroad within the last seven to 14 days, be aware of the following symptoms. - So this thing has little tiny spikes that spring out and attach your lungs. Boom, infection. Yeah, the trippy thing is this virus is new. Never seen it before, though it's related to bird flu, SARS, MERS, all those horrible respiratory illnesses that make people drown in their own sputum. Wow. - But that's just worst case scenario. I mean, it's not even in our country, thank God. You, you look good. - Oh, thanks. - What it been, like six months since we've hung out? - Gosh, I think so, yeah. Six, hmm. - How's the new job? - Good, I have been busy, on the go a lot and I was kind of shocked to see that the nix on the upcoming project happened, but you're probably right. It's better to be safe right now with everything going on, and I definitely don't want whatever it is that you're talking about 'cause blah. How's Beth, are you guys good? We're separated. - Shit, duh, I'm sorry. - Oh no, no, no. It's fine, it's for the best, trust me. I was beginning to think she didn't like me much as a person, just angry all the time. I don't want a relationship like that, you know? - Yeah, probably for the best. And whatever was going on inside of her probably had nothing to do with you in the end, you know? Something that she has to deal with our own. Trust me, I know that feeling all too well. - Come on, you're great. - Hey, you've known me long enough to know that I've been through some shit, okay? And I've worked pretty hard to be in a good place and a better person and I think you have too. - Hey, I'll drink to that. Yeah. As death tolls rise locally, officials are urging us all to stay indoors and continue to practice social distancing When you have to leave your home. Holy shit. The virus is spreading. Everything seems to be getting worse and I'll admit, I'm scared. I'm scared of others and I'm scared of myself. Microphone? Good vibes. Candles, how romantic. Finally, some info. Express Couriers. - Hi. Hi, yeah, I actually, I recently received a shipment from your company. - A shipment? - A few of them, actually. No? I mean, okay. I didn't really actually order anything from you. How can I help you, miss? - I was wondering if you could tell me where they came from, but these mystery boxes just keep arriving with sort of random things in them and-- Order access number? - Yeah, well that's the thing. There's not really an order number or any information. - It's your fault, miss. - Hello? Nate. Hey, buddy, what's up? - Hey hey, Ru-bay. You seem peppy, what you up to? - Oh you know, just doing some work. I came across some photos that made me smile. Hey, do you remember that day we went up to the old water tower and I roped you into being my assistant? You carried all my gear all the way up that hill. - Yeah, the water tower. Aw man, it just happened to be, I think, the hottest day in a decade. And there we were. - Yeah, that feels like so long ago. Anyway, what's up with you? - You know, I've been busier than ever with this whole virus thing. Aw man, I just wanted to give you a heads up though. I think local officials are gonna start locking things down a bit. - Really, that seems like a bit over the top. Don't you think? - Well the thing is, there's not really adequate testing for this sort of thing so theoretically, we don't really have a way of tracking it. And you know, until people start showing symptoms and by then, it's too late and well government, they're not really giving us the facts that they should. - Okay, so what does this all mean? - Hey look, all I'm saying is lay low for a bit, and don't be surprised if things start to seem a bit off. We don't really have all the facts and well, a lot of people are gonna get sick. A lot of people already are sick. - Nate, you're kind of freaking me out. - Hey, I got your back. Just keep safe and I'll be in touch. Oh, and wash your hands. Like a lot, dude. Seriously, like a lot, okay? - 'Kay. Virus. - Hey, there she is! - Dad, hi. - Hi, I was in the area and I thought I might stop by and bring you some coffee. - Thanks. - I tried calling you a few times, but I got no answer. - Yeah, sorry about that. I was sleeping pretty hard, I guess. - Oh. - But come on in. - Still smoking those things, huh? I've been nicotine free for almost a year now. Feels great. - That's good, Dad. - You know, there are resources to help. - Look, you know I hardly smoke, okay? I've just been under stress and bored, honestly. - I hear ya. Well, it's my fault for smoking around you all those years. - It's my choice. Okay listen, I'll stop soon. This is my last pack, I won't buy another one. Cool? What are you doing out here anyways? Well, I'm onto a new job and I was just passing through. I know we had plans to go to dinner soon, but I'm gonna be out of town for a while. - What kind of job? Dad? - Don't worry, it's legit. A friend of mine owns some property out of town and he needs some help for a few weeks. Besides, I didn't wanna miss by chance to see you since we both have crazy scheduling, these days. - Well, it's always good to see you. Hey, Nate had said something to me about this virus that's going around and I guess it can get pretty sketchy. Respiratory illness, so just be careful, okay? - Nate! Oh, how's he doing? You guys were always such a good team. - Nate's good, Dad. Just take care of yourself, all right? Wash your hands and watch out. - Sweetie. No silly virus is gonna take down your old dad. - Okay. - Well, it was nice seeing you, kiddo. - Yeah, you too, thanks for stopping by. - Oh, you got a package. Another one? - You're ordering stuff online after puffing those greens, huh? Dad. Love you, thanks for stopping by. Take care of yourself, okay? I'll do that. Wow. Whoever is sending this is into some freaky shit. What? Gotta be kidding. Hi. I knew you was into that dominatrix shit. - Come on, it's not a bad look, now is it? - Seriously though, what's up with the trash? - Honestly, I wish I knew. These packages just showing up. I think they're for someone else. - Winning for you. - Yeah anyways, what are you up to? I'm not gonna lie, I panicked. I bought a whole bunch of supplies 'cause I heard we about to be on lock pretty soon. - Wait, supplies, like what? - You know, water, canned goods, toilet paper. - Okay, you know that this is not a nuclear holocaust, right? It's a respiratory infection. Besides, I talked to Nate and he said just wash your hands, a bunch, and lay low. - Really? - Yeah. In fact, I'm gonna do a deep clean on my house. I know it's, it's past due. - Oo, good idea, we should have a cleaning party. - Let's stream it later, we can have music, drinks. Make it fun. - Oh my gosh, that sounds like so much fun. I'm down, I'll talk to you soon, okay? All right, you ready? Cheers. - Let's do this. - Oo, that's good. Girl, I'm sweating over here. You are too much. - You're telling me. It feels good to get a workout in, though. Ruby, wait. There's. - What? - There was someone, it showed another viewer and then it was gone. - Girl, I think you need to lay off the drinks, okay? - Very funny. - No seriously, though, I feel like a sweaty pig. I'm gonna go wash my body. All right, love you. - Bye. Yeah, see you later. - My brain just won't turn off. I feel overwhelmed and confused. Where do we go from here? This stuck feeling, like I'm just spinning deeper and deeper into the void. Hello? Girl, turn on the news, this shit is getting real. Really? - Just do it. - Okay, okay, I'll go turn it on. You do know that you get worked up real easily though right? - This is different and you know it. - Okay, okay, we'll see about that. - Officials are still working to trace the origin of the novel virus. We now know it has been confirmed in both humans and animals, and is rapidly spreading across the globe. With three cases in California confirmed, fear amongst local citizens is on the rise. With current death tolls jumping into the thousands in what seems to be an overnight event, the World Health Organization is asking everyone to stay home. - I knew it, we are so fucked. Shh. - We urge citizens to stay safe by taking these following steps. Wash and sanitize all touched surfaces in the home, wash your hands thoroughly and often, and avoid touching your face. This is Wendy D, reporting for KLOL. - Good thing our cribs are spic and span. Yeah. God, this is scary. - I'm telling you, this is just the beginning. My cousin is in the military and said they're being briefed on all sorts of stuff right now. - I bet, but the stay at home thing seems like a bit much, considering there's not even any confirmed cases here. - People need to work, and school, I have student loans. This is crazy. Yeah, I feel you there. Oh hey, Nate's trying to get me on the other line. I should probably take this, yeah? - Yes. I'm going to call my mom, she's probably trippin'. Okay, text me and let me know what he says, okay? - Yeah, for sure. Okay, bye. Nate. - Okay, I know you've seen the news by now. - Yeah dude, this is next level, what's going on? - I hate to say it mama, but I'm with them. It's a good idea to stay home, like for real. - I mean yeah, fine. I'm pretty much a homebody anyways, but this all seems like a bit much, don't you think? - Hey, it's temporary, okay? And honestly, it's for the best. This thing is spreading way too quickly and there just aren't enough tests and resources to contain it. We just don't know enough about it and so far, everything we throw at it won't kill it without killing us, too. - Shit. - Hey, I'm here. If there's anything you need, just holler. I got enough nerdy gear to help keep us safe out there in the world, okay? If there's any supplies you need, just ask. - Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Officials are still working to trace the origin of the novel virus. We now know it has been confirmed in both humans and animals, and is rapidly spreading across the globe. With three cases in California confirmed, fear amongst local citizens is on the rise. Shit. Angie. It's okay, it's whatever, it's clean, it's okay. It's everywhere. Is it real? Is it everywhere? Is it real? Is it planned? It's planned. Is it on me? It's on me. Come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Nate. Hey, it's Ruby. Call me back, okay? I'm just kind of having a, you know. Just call me back when you can, okay? Thanks. Nate? Hey, it's Angie, you all right? Yeah, just working out a little bit. So I'm a little winded. Why, what's up, how are you? I can't sleep. This shit has me thinking about so much. Yeah, same here. With current death tolls jumping into the thousands in what seems to be an overnight event, the World Heath Organization is asking everyone to stay home. - Wide awake. Too tired, too scared. Alone. The virus is spreading. Everything seems to be getting worse. I'm scared. Hey. - Hey, lady. Sorry I didn't get back to you last night. - Oh, it's okay. I was just kind of having a moment. - A moment, you doing okay? - Yeah, I mean, I think so. - Hey, you let me know if you need anything, all right? - Will do. Hey, how are things going with you? I'm sure you guys are busy planning for the end of the world and all. Super busy, you guessed it. Hey, why don't I send over some lunch? That way, you can just chill and watch a movie while you grub? Sound good? - You're the sweetest, you know that? I'm just about to hop in the shower, but that's awesome. - All right, I got you girl. - Thank you. Hi. Great, could you put it down? - Oh, sure. - Great, thank you. - Have a nice day, miss. - You too, thanks. Angie? - Hey, boo. Is it me or being stuck at home 24/7 in the way? Like I would literally kill for a latte right about now. Yeah, a latte. - Hello? Are you okay? - Yeah. There was somebody in my yard. It just kinda freaked me out a little. - Shit. Could it have been the gardener or something? - No, I didn't really get a good look. I was watching a movie, had some food, fell asleep, and I heard a sound and... And just, it was too late, he was gone. - But just make sure all the doors are locked. Turn the alarm on and smoke a bowl. Just shut off for a bit. - Yeah no, I'll be okay, I took something for it. It should help. - Girl. - You know, hey, some ganja might help after all. - That's right. I'm about to do the same thing, get my relax on. You still got that pepper spray I gave you? - I've still got it, in my drawer, ready to go. - Good, good, good. We just have to be patient. Death toll's on the rise right now and it looks like we're not gonna be able to leave home any time soon. - All right. Love you. - You too.

Welcome to my gourmet cooking hour. Now, we've got land, sea, roots, and fruits. I invite you into my very own home kitchen where we make the best quarantine meal you've ever had. First, you start with the root. Root vegetables are very important and make you one, within. And then, we remember that water is life. I think we need a little liquid in our food. I think we all have canned goods sitting around, at the moment. Now, for the spices. Never a bad idea. Especially when you're all by yourself. If you're a pescatarian, we got you. A little leaf. Now for those that are carnivorous, we've got you covered, as well. I'm not leaving anybody out. Fresh goodness. I would like to thank each and every one of you for being here tonight. This is so exciting. This is to you, king of the jungle. I know you've been very busy lately, and to you, mystical one. And to you. We'll talk later. And to my friend here. In case anybody gets rambunctious, don't act up, all right? Yeah, this is great, you know. A special occasion. I'm glad that you guys are all here with me. Well, you guys are a lively bunch. I thought we were gonna, you know, party or something. You eat up all my food. You didn't even offer to clean up. I mean, kinda rude. Time to go. Stuck in my mind. Am I safe? I just wanna feel normal. What is normal anyways? Where do we go when we fall asleep? That feeling when you gently start to slip away and then, boom. Terror. And you're right back where you started.

No, no. - As some people are concerned with loss of income, others are dealing with mental illness and domestic violence issues or both, due to the shelter in place order. This has affected us all. - Come on, Ruby. I need to take a piss, are you gonna let me in? Hello in there. - Haven't seen you for a while. How have you been? - Fucking great, now teach me. - Shit. - Okay, let's get to it. Remember, always start slow. Apply pressure. - Dammit Ruby, I gotta piss. - Good girl. You got this.

Ruby, open up. Ruby, Ruby, open up. Ruby, hello? Ruby, hello? - Nate, go away. - Oh, Ruby. Oh, thank God, open the door. - No fucking way. - What, it's me, Nate. Open the door, please. - Yeah, and catch the fucking plague? No way, absolutely not. - It doesn't work that way. Trust me, just open the door. Hey. What, no. Okay, okay, you got me. Shit, can we talk? Damn. All right. All right, friend. How you doing? - What? Why? I'm fine. - I tried calling you a bunch of times. So did Angie and your dad. He actually called me, tripping out last night. Can't handle it? Got everything you need, got your meds? - I could use more. If I could just please get some sleep, some quiet. I'll be fine. Whoa! - Okay, I'm right here. I'm a little concerned, if I'm being honest. Thanks for the fucking concern and all. I'm not allowed to have a little fun? Look, why don't you come with me, all right? We'll go on a drive. You can just relax, zone out. We'll go get your meds, get you some food. You want me, you want me to go out there? Out there? The virus, it's everywhere. It's everywhere! And people are acting like fucking savages out there. Look-- - Yo, back the fuck up! Back up. - Look, you don't have to worry about anything, okay? I've been tested, I don't have the virus. It's mandatory at my job to get tested, okay? Look, you're gonna be fine, all right? I got everything that we need. And trust me, okay, it's gonna be okay. Just trust me. I got gloves, I got sanitizer. I got a zombie rig. You gotta check this shit out, all right? Why didn't you say that sooner? Are you sure you have sanitizer? - I got sanitizer. Why don't I do my whole body with this? Do you wanna get some shoes? You got, got one. Okay, one shoe, that works. Yeah, see? Isn't it nice outside? Yeah, take a deep breath. You're all right. What's up? Stay away from me. - Where are you going? - Jesus, are you kidding me, Ruby? Come on. Oh, come on. Ruby, come on, you know I have asthma. - You're a fucking liar! Ruby. Ruby, come on. I'm not a marathon man, you know I got asthma. - Nate, what do you want from me? - I know some of us need a little bit more help than others, but that's why I'm here for you, all right? Look, I just ran. I got fucking asthma, man. You don't see me dying in the street. - How am I supposed to trust anyone right now? This is crazy. - Look, I know we're all scared right now. I know everyone's scared, none of us have ever dealt with anything like this, but I got you. - What's the point? - You know I'm here for you, okay? I love you. Do you see that? I love you. - Really? Really? Really, why? Why, you know I don't deserve you. - Don't, don't say that. Why, why not? I feel like I don't deserve you, half the time. Like yeah, I watch you and I see, you know, what you do to yourself and I feel like I should have been there. Like actually been there. Not just watching you, but be there. I feel like I don't even deserve that after what I did. - You've been watching me this whole time? What do you mean? - What do you mean me, I mean, did you see me? Like, I'm just watching over you. I just need to make sure you're okay. So yeah, I've been watching you. Like when you cut yourself and like when your dad called. Hey, it was cathartic, it was beautiful, it was manic. Slightly terrifying at times, yes, but you, even on all your states of being, I accept you. God, I love you, I always have and I always will. - Mm-hm, yeah, sure. Right, love, that's real cute. That's cute, I like that, love. Is that what we're supposed to do now? Yes. - Okay, okay. - I get it, I get you. I've always loved you. - Why me? - Like I fucking love you! Don't you see that? I nearly died trying to catch up with you in the fucking zombie ass streets. I got a zombie rig I got decked out just for you. You know how much that cost? - Fine, fine, fine. - It's okay. Come on, one step. One step closer, two steps back. You know that Paula Abdul song? No, it's a joke, all right? Come on, it's okay. It's okay, see? Look, I'm not dying. Nate, what made you send me all those crazy packages? I mean, some of them were pretty cool, but others left me kinda confused. - Packages? - Yeah. - I saw all that stuff all over your house. - Really? You sure? Big Mart on line.
