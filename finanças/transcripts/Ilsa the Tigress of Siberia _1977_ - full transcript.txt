[GRUNTING] [PANTING] [HORSE SNORTING] [PANTING] [HORSE WHINNIES] [GROANING] [HORSE WHINNIES] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] Eyes ahead, zek! Open the gate! SOLDIER: Work crew ready. Move, zeks. SOLDIER: Pick up your feet, scum. Move, faster! You two grow soft. One hour to catch a carrion like that? Next time take me, Comrade Colonel. I will show you. [LAUGHING] Here at Gulag 14, there is a certain formality before a death is certified. This dog tried to escape. He planned to trick us. Perhaps even now he cheats us. We must make certain. Watch and remember well. [GROANING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [ROARING] SOLDIER: Move, pigs, move! Back to your barracks! To your huts, dogs! SOLDIER: Faster, faster! SOLDIER: Stinking carrion! [GROWLING] [GROWLING] See how Sasha loves the taste of man. [GROWLING] [CHAINS CLINKING] [HORSE SNORTING] [METAL CREAKING] [DRIVER YELLING] PRISONER: Slowly, my friend. It may have to last you many hours. So, why are you here? What was your crime? There was a party at the Academy one night. My friends and I drank too much vodka. Some windows were broken. It was nothing serious. But they sentenced me to six months. But my father will help. He will get me out. And who is your father? General Zerov. What is your name? Nikolai. I'm Andrey. You are not afraid? I will work hard. These rumors of the gulag... they are all lies. Lies to frighten children with. [GRAVE MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [HORSE SNORTING] SOLDIER: Run when I call you! Run! I welcome you to Gulag 14. It is he who has sent you here, and he alone will permit you to leave. If you fail to cooperate, if you resist our efforts to turn you into useful citizens, you will die here. Commissar. Yes, Comrade Colonel. [COUGHING] So... you are General Zerov's son? Yes, Comrade Colonel. My friends in Moscow suggest he will soon be joining you here. No, Comrade Colonel, he's... Silence! You were sentenced to six months of hard labor. It is now nine. We know how to deal with pampered hooligans. So, Andrey Chicurin, the so-called political thinker. A scribbler of handbills and pamphlets. Rest assured we will cure you. I've no sickness, Comrade Colonel. You were sentenced by the People's Court. Are you suggesting the court was in error? The laws and makers of them are evil, not justice. Brave words, political thinker, but foolish ones. We will break you. You will break my body, yes, but my mind and spirit, those you cannot reach. [WHIPPING] How dare you speak to me with such insolence? You think we do not know how to deal with counter-revolutionaries? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] This cold will freeze the golden piss of Lucifer himself. Think of other things, my friend, like vodka. Hot spiced wine and a side of venison. [WHINNYING] You clumsy, stupid turd of Sodom. You piece of devil shit. [WHINNYING] [GROANING] Help us! All of you! Win your freedom! Brothers, kill them! [GRUNTING] [YELLING] Get back, you dogs. Get back! [GRUNTING] [WHINNYING] [GUNSHOT] [GROANING] Smash the turd, Vassily. Beat his face in! All right, who started it? Who was the leader? This piece of devil shit. I'll break every bone in his body. Let him go. But he attacked... Release him. You will kill him too quickly, Dimitri. Sasha has not eaten for three days. [PANTING] You like to fight, pig? Get in. [CHUCKLING] Sasha will give all the fighting you want. One to one. [LAUGHING] Why are you shaking, zek? [PURRING] DIMITRI: Make friends with the beast. GREGOR: She likes you, zek. See how she sniffs your feet. [TREMBLING] [GROWLING] MAN: Open it up! [GROANING] MAN: She's waiting for you! [LAUGHS] [WHIMPERING] MAN: Get him, Sasha. Break the filthy zek's bones. [SCREAMING] [PRISONER SCREAMING] [GUARD LAUGHING] [TEARING] [RIPPING] GUARD ONE: All quiet? GUARD TWO: Hmm! They sleep like the dead. My brotherhood of Cossacks. [SHATTERING] You pile of dung. You almost hit me. Just trying to knock some sense into your skull. Yaah! My skull? [GAGGING] By St. Isaac the Syrian, I'll drive your head down your throat! [BALALAIKA MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUDING] Hey! Hey! Hey. Hey! Hey! [SHOUTING IN MERRIMENT] Hey, let me do it. What have you got to offer compared to me? It's longer, it's stronger, it's harder... [GRUNTING] Not now. [GROWLING] Tonight you are mine. My beautiful... [GRUNTING] ILSA: Go now. My champions, come. [SPLASHING] [BOTH LAUGHING] You will catch a fever in those wet clothes. You will get sick and then you'll not be able to do anything for poor, poor Olga. Katya will help you. [MOANING] My brothers, my comrades. Your body is so full and warm... like Mother Russia herself. [MOANING] Oh, yes, my bulls, my stallions. Let us dig together. Oh, yes! Together as one. Skin like silk. Oh, Ivan, Ivan, Ivan. My lance reaches deep. Yes. Oh. Gently, gently, little brother. Little no more. Let us see who digs deepest, Tovarich. [MOANING] [GRAVE MUSIC PLAYING] Again? No more. Sleep now. No sleep. You say you are man of iron. I feel only a little squashed cabbage. By the hair on St. Basil's wart, let me sleep! As wide as the Black Sea, as long as the Volga. Here, you drink. I drink, I drink forever. River flows forever. Olga like river. GUARD: Forward, forward. Ah! Stay, little zechka. We are not finished. There is more ploughing to be done. Then, my brothers, you must plough each other. That hairy monkey? His breath is like devil's fart. I have work to do. Commissar will be waiting. GREGOR: Let him wait. He's a machine, that one. Not a man. Even machines have their uses. [CLANKING] Who is this? Joseph Stalin. Who is he? A dictator and a murderer. [SPARKING] [GRUNTING] We will try again. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Lavrenty Beria. The Minister of Interior. He is your friend? He's my enemy. [SPARKING] [GRUNTING] I will break him, Comrade Colonel. He will learn like all the rest. Do you enjoy pain, Chicurin? Lavrenty Beria wades through the blood of millions. You're like a foolish ox. This defiance will mean your death. Then kill me. Our task is to re-train your mind. When that is completed, perhaps then we will consider whether or not your body is of any further use to the State. Now we will make it easy. Lev... don't rest until you break him. I will not fail, Comrade Colonel. I suggest you don't for then it would be clear that you would be of no further use to this camp or to the State. [DOOR CLOSES] You dog. You stinking zek. You bundle of sheep gut. [GRUNTS] This stinking carrion refuses to work, Comrade Colonel. They tell me you are burning up with fever. I'm sick, Comrade Colonel. I try to work hard, but I burn up, Comrade Colonel. Dimitri, this man does not deserve the lash of your whip, did you not hear him? He's burning up with fever. He's very hot. He needs a treatment which will cure him. [GRAVE MUSIC PLAYING] No, no. No, Comrade. Oh, please. If you are sick, you cannot work. That is not good. This fever must be broken. Please. DIMITRI: See, Colonel wishes to help you. [CRANKING] Please have mercy, Comrade Colonel. [GROANING] Oh, no. No, no! Oh, no, Comrade Colonel, No, no! Oh, please. No, Comrade Colonel. No, no! [COUGHING] [SPLASHING] ILSA: Good, he's on his way. DIMITRI: Slowly, Ivan. He burns up. Remember? [GROANS] [CLANKING] [COUGHING] [GASPING] ILSA: All right, Ivan, we'll bring him back now. [GASPING] IVAN: Bon voyage, my friend. He's coming. DIMITRI: Keep turning, Gregor. I do not think he will be troubled with such sickness again. [SPLASHING] [GRUNTING] Now perhaps you are ready to reconsider your answers. Who is this? Tell me. Jo... Joseph Stalin. Say, "He's the father of all Russian people." Say it! He... Say it. He is the... Go on, tell me! He is the father... [GRUNTS] ...of every atrocity committed in this land. [SPARKING] [GRUNTING] You will be a vegetable when I'm finished with you. SOLDIER: In line, stand in line! You want your rations cut, dogs? [COUGHING] PRISONER: Mine, it is mine! GUARD: Stop that, you dogs! You hear me? [GRUNTS] Get up! Come on, you zeks! Is this what you have learned here? To become fighting animals? He stole my bread, Comrade Colonel. He lies, he is the thief. It was him, Comrade Colonel. Who saw this? You cannot both be telling the truth. It is there in his hand. I do not lie, I swear, this is mine, Comrade Colonel. We shall see tonight. Perhaps truth will give strength to the honest hand. [SAWING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] The hand of a thief, Comrade Colonel. [SCREAMING] He is of no further use to the State. [GRUNTING] God, Oh, my God. Ah... Oh, Lord. [CHAINSAW BUZZES] [MAN SCREAMS] [EXHALES] Sleep... sleep. Ah... [CLATTERING] To her left nipple. Her left. [SHATTERING] I'll tear them out one by one and stuff them up your crack. [GROANING] To the fair hair on her silken belly. The fair. [SHATTERING] Son of a cow whose mother spread her legs for everyone who came near her. To the hair closest to the entrance to paradise. To the closest. [SHATTERING] VASSILY: Bastard son of three-humped camel. You're a sodomite sheep. [GRUNTING] Brother, enough, enough! [GRUNTING] Hey. [SHATTERING] To the victors the spoils. Ah, Gregor, why are you sitting all bunched up? Katya is here. She needs you. And Ivan has a present for me too. Yes? Oh. [MOANING] Katya needs help. Faster, faster! Dig spurs in deep. My Cossack steed. [LAUGHING] DIMITRI: We will ride all night. I will carry you across mountains and valleys. [MERRY MUSIC PLAYING] Time to change horses, zechka. [SCREAMING] [LAUGHING] [MOANING] GUARD: Forward, you scum! Move faster! You want the taste of the whip? Ah, it is dead. The line must be down. Where are the new prisoners? The cart should've reached here by now. You want I should ride to the railhead? Yes. Go. I will ride like the wind, Comrade Colonel. So, Commissar? Chicurin shows no signs of progress. This man is different, Comrade Colonel. There is a streak in him. I need more time. No, time will not help you. If he's so different, perhaps we should try a different approach. He is very stubborn. Bring him to me. Now? If he's stubborn like a mule, perhaps he will respond to a carrot. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Come in, Chicurin. I have things I wish to say to you. You must not think we are barbarians. We have been given a responsibility, an important one. One that will turn you from an enemy of the State into one of its strongest defenders. We cannot shirk this task, Chicurin. Oh, we are forced to use harsh methods, but for those who cooperate, the rewards are many, both in the future and in the present. I think... perhaps you are ready to taste some of the rewards that await you to remind yourself what it is like to be a free man again. Show me you have not forgotten a woman's body, Chicurin. In our village, you could tell about the girls that no one wanted. They had the stink of the pigsty all about them, and they could never wash it off. You are a dead man, Chicurin. [GRUNTS] [LAUGHING] [GROWLING] VASSILY: By St. Stella's thatch, the beast is hungry. [LAUGHING] [ROARING] [GUARD LAUGHING] The Marshall is dead. What? The Marshall's dead. Stalin. Beria has been executed. And there is more. What? General Zerov is coming. Say no more. Take them back to the barracks. We are finished here. [ROARING] Take the prisoners back to the barracks. Come on, move. Quick, you dogs. [GROWLING] Faster, faster. Move when I tell you. [PANTING] He is dead. Dead I tell you. And Zerov comes with his Ukrainians. There is very little time. [GROWLING] [CLATTERING] All zeks in! Inside. Faster! Faster! [YELLING] GUARD: Shoot them down! [GUNSHOT] Gasoline and torches. Quick. GUARD: Stop! Halt! [ROARING] More fuel. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] Cover the doors. Over here! Quick! [NEIGHING] MEN: Fire! Break it down! [ROARING] NICOLAI: Andrey. Andrey, Andrey. Take this! [FIRE CRACKLING] [SHATTERING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GROWLING] [LAUGHING] [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTING] [GUNSHOT] By St. Agatha's... I will carry you, Tovarich. [GRUNTING] [ROARING] [ROARING WILDLY] [PANTING] Andrey, Andrey. Up here. [GUNSHOT] Burn in hell, zeks. [GUNSHOT] [FIRE RUMBLES] [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] She will not escape, my friend. Your death will be avenged. I swear it. [FIRE CRACKLING] [GRUNTING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] ANNOUNCER: What a game, What a series! You saw perhaps the finest game of the series here in Montreal this afternoon. Outstanding play from both teams. End to end play, brilliant goal tending. I don't think the crowd has caught its breath yet. I know I haven't. And what a way to end it. A 3-3 tie, with that last minute goal by Motzel. A tremendous series, this World Cup. To the fine young Russian Hockey players, we say au revoir, bon voyage as you head for Moscow. And what a city to bring you the last game, Montreal, the host of the '76 Olympics. A beautiful city, a great host. [TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING] Just a visit. There is enough time before the plane leaves, Comrade. We can go out the back door. Three months we have been in training, Comrade. Three months without a woman. And tomorrow, back to Moscow. Please, Comrade. To go home and not to have had a North American woman? It would be a crime. And last night, after the game, in the showers, I do not like the way he is looking at me.Hey. If he does not have a woman soon... We did well in the game. The coach was pleased. Yes? And you? Even security guards must relax. Have some fun. Yes? [LAUGHING] A black girl with skin like silk and red, red lips. And where will you find such a girl? And one for Josef also. There's a place we know. One of the Canadian players told us. he goes there many times. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Three hours, no more. Here we are. Won't you come in? [GROOVY MUSIC PLAYING] Well, what about you, sir? No, I... I'll just wait for my friends. Oh, well, that'll be 80 dollars, sir. We've a very nice waiting room outside. Thank you. You take it off now. I got a better idea. You take it off for me. [LAUGHING] You like boobs, right? Like soft white doves... with small hard beaks. Three months without a woman. Three months. You got a lot of catching up to do. [LAUGHING] What a way to die. [CHUCKLING] Baby... You okay? Mm-hmm. [LAUGHING] [MOANING] [GRAVE MUSIC PLAYING] He's hungry, that one. Sound. I'm not giving you any BJ, mister. I gave you 20 bucks. ILSA: Enough. She has forgotten her responsibility to me and to her customers. I think a few days up here are necessary for her. She needs reminding. I'll get her tomorrow. Check the waiting rooms. [CLINKING] I know him. I'm sure. There is something about... Oh, it is not possible. GREGOR: What is it? It is he. Chicurin. Andrey Chicurin. Gulag 14. Chicurin? He was dead. I saw his body in the pit. He must have escaped. He's here in Montreal. But... But why? He cannot know you are here. You covered your tracks too well. How can you be sure? No, I cannot take that risk. There's too much at stake. I'll call Luc and Starr. They're still in town. Tell them to pick him up. Alive. I want him alive. [GRAVE MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [SHATTERING] [SHATTERING] [GROANING] [GROANING] [GRUNTING] [GROANING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECH] He said he would meet us back here. Where is he? Alex, we have to go. The plane! His clothes are still here. Why is he not back? He'll miss the plane. I... I have been thinking. Perhaps... Perhaps he is not coming. What? Perhaps he has defected. Defected? They will blame us. We will say nothing. We... we left the hotel with him, and then... then he went off by himself. And we did not see him again. Well, they will question us. We are sports heroes of the Soviet Union. He was not with us. You understand? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [WHIRRING] [WHIRRING] So... Andrey Chicurin. We meet again. It seems I underestimated your persistence. You? I shall not make that mistake again. [CHUCKLES] Neither will your old friends, nor my new Brotherhood. You have met Luc and Starr. And this is Hans. What do you want of me? Information. And to finish the job we began in Siberia. Why? Why is it important? Because, my friend, I'm a perfectionist. I think it will be less difficult this time. We have improved our techniques. But this is not Russia. You have no prisoners here. You will tell me everything you know. About your employer, about General Zerov. His agents here in North America, his network, everything you know. I told you I will break you, Chicurin. No, not then, not now. In the morning, I will show you. Lev will demonstrate his new techniques. You will see, my friend. Take him to his quarters. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [ELECTRICAL WHIRRING] [CLICKING] [CLICKING] [CLICKING] [CLICKING] [DOOR OPENS] I'm sure you remember Lev. And this is Carol. She wants to work in one of our parlors, but first we must assess her strengths and weaknesses. She is being exposed to a series of pictures. They are projected at her with great speed. As they pass through her subconscious, my computer is checking and analyzing the reaction of her brain waves from every part of her nervous system. Every fear, every weakness she has will be uncovered. And when Lev has discovered her deepest terror, she will be exposed to it. Then her mind will be conditioned to only one thing. To avoid that terror... she must obey. ILSA: The computer has detected what she fears more than anything else. What? You will see. [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Oh. Ah! [GROANS] Ah! [SCREAMING] Only a three-dimensional projection to us, but to her it is a real and living nightmare world, one she will not wish to enter again. And you believe you can break me? Break my will with pictures? Don Romando doubted also. Who is he? Don Romando? He did not think I could take over his organization. He has since changed his mind. [ITALIAN ACCENT] "And I freely give all of this, "all of my girls, "all of parlors, all my men. "Boys, I'm going to Florida to retire "and work in my tomato garden. "I don't want you to call me no more. "I don't want you to come and see me. "I just want you to do like the signora tells you." I sign. "Guido R." There, I don't give you no trouble no more. And now there is only Passolini's organization left. ROMANDO: I talk to him. I am cousin to his wife's half brother. I tell him, "Get out of town." But you will be in Florida. Yeah. Pompano Beach. You'd best be on your way. They will take you to the airport. Signora, I want to thank you. Have a good trip. [MOTOR WHIRRING] [SPEAKS ITALIAN] What is it? It is a mistake. Signora, what do you want of me? Signora, please, please. I do not like loose ends. Signora, no. I do anything you say. I sign the papers. No, no! No. [SCREAMING] You promised me I could retire. Signora, please, please. No! Signora, please, please. [SCREAMING] Please! I will do anything for you! Please! I swear on my mother's grave! Signora, Signora! Per favore!Signora! [SCREAMING] We should change the spot. It must be getting crowded down there. So, Chicurin. It is now your turn. Tonight Lev will program the computer for you. [CLICKING] [CLICKING] You are wasting your time, Chicurin. The computer will compensate for conscious pain reactions. Only your subconscious reactions will be recorded. One by one. Passolini's much smarter than Romando. Look, my man. We know where he goes, what he does and what he doesn't. I mean he's regular as clockwork. Look at that motel he takes those chicks to. We could hit him there anytime. Yeah, but how do we get close? He has goons crawling all over the place. ILSA: Do not worry about him. I have a plan. I will tell you about it later. [SEDUCTIVE MUSIC PLAYING] Hot damn. Tonight me. Me alone. Wait, I'll fight you. No, tonight I choose. Ebony and Gold. [MOANING] That's good, very good. Ah, ah. Why did you not report this immediately? But, General, we did not... No, no. I tell you, a man like Andrey Chicurin does not defect. Out. Get me the embassy in Montreal. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Yes, General. You will work together as a team. Both of you together. We will start at once, General. Good, good. I want immediate results. You know where the trail starts. Find out where it ends. Find Chicurin. Yes, General. [PANTING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] So, Chicurin... you shall see how fantasy becomes reality. [GROOVY MUSIC PLAYING] Yes, her. I like her. WOMAN: Now you just come along with me. MAN: Down here? WOMAN: Just grab my arm. My arm, honey. Hey, you're real eager, eh? MAN: You are very beautiful. Thanks. Where are you from? The Soviet Union, Russia. A Russian, hey? My ship is in port a few days only. A friend of mine... He tell me about this place. He tell me of you. Oh, yeah? That TV camera in corner. What is it for? Now, don't you worry about it, honey. It's just security, you know. Sometimes a guy gets carried away. Stops trouble before it starts. I don't like to perform for people behind camera. They're not watching, not now. Only if I press this panic button. See? My friend did not tell me of camera. I get the message, Comrade. He was here for the hockey series. He came one night only. His last night. His first time with black girl, he say to you. WOMAN: A young kid? MAN: Alex. WOMAN: Why don't you make yourself more comfortable. MAN: Later, you lie down first. I massage you. Suit yourself, honey. That's better. Thelma called. Thought you'd like to know. Another Russian. A seaman this time. He came with two friends, perhaps you remember them also. Friends? What kind of friends? Another young man, like him, and an older man. [CLICKING] I like to watch you... Enough! He's no seaman. He's asking too many questions. He's one of Zerov's men. He's been sent to find Chicurin. The place must be closed down immediately and the girls brought back here. You want him taken care of? Yes. I will call Gregor. But it must look like an accident. [MOANING] [GRAVE MUSIC PLAYING] GREGOR: Coitus interuptus, Comrade. Sally, you should leave now. Control, this is six-four-twelve. Just checking cable Harry, Able, Seven, Two, Apple. That's right. Can you give me the address of receiver? I will check it out there. Yeah. Yeah. Just a little prick, Comrade. And then you are going to feel very sleepy. Da? [WHIRRING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [WHIMPERS] [SCREAMING] [RADIO STATIC] [SIGHS] Damn. Go now. You think you hate me. Yes? Yes. Your mind may tell you that, but the computer tells me that... that your body thinks otherwise. [LAUGHING] [EXHALES] You are growing stronger. Stronger. Stronger... You need me. You want me. You're on fire. Oh, your mind cannot control your body. You feel me. [MOANING] [SPITS] With every scream you make tomorrow, Chicurin, you will remember me. ZEROV: Yes, yes, Igor. She was one of Stalin's bitches. I have a personal score to settle with her. She killed my son. No, no, I will take care of the rest. Everything is prepared. They are leaving immediately. Yes, they are the best we have. They will know what to do. You have only one job. Confirm that the rat stays in the hole. [TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING] [GRAVE MUSIC PLAYING] Red four. The rat hasn't moved from its hole. [ENGINE IDLING] [LIQUID GUSHING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Okay, Passolini, when the fireworks start, you're gonna turn into a big fat Roman candle. [BEEPING] [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] What's the matter? Passolini not teach you how to read? Maybe Passolini not read either. The sign, it says, "Private Property." Passolini? [GRUNTS] [GRAVE MUSIC PLAYING] [CLICKING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] It's party time. [GROOVY MUSIC PLAYING] To victory. [CLINKING] [TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING] [BEEPING] That's something else. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] It was a cinch. Cheers. Bottom's up. [GRUNTING] [GROANING] [PARTY MUSIC PLAYING] And now it's time for entertainment. Very special entertainment. [MURMURING] [GASPING] And now you will see what happens to those who defy me. [UNZIPPING] And so, Chicurin...it begins. [WHIRRING] [COMMOTION] [SCREAMING] Take positions. Quickly. Here, grab this. Cover the stairs. [SHATTERING] [WOMAN SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] [GUNFIRE] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] MAN: Move it! Watch out! [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] [SNAPPING] [GUNFIRE] [GUNFIRE] [SCREAMING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [SHATTERING] [GRUNTING] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNFIRE] [SNOWMOBILE IDLING] [GROANING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [GROANING] [GROANING] So? The bitch has escaped again. [SCREAMING] [GROANING] [GROANING] Oh. It's yours, Chicurin. Yours. All of it. All of it. You'll be rich, Chicurin. Rich. It is yours. All of it. Just help me, huh? Quickly. No! You come back. I order you! You come back! Chicurin! [SCREAMING] You come back! [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING]
