You know that reality TV can make you a little crazy. I mean it. Don't come any... Son of a bitch. Otis, don't. Otis! See what happens? You stupid fuck. You gonna get that? I'll get it. Prescott. When? All right. I'll be right there. What is it? Nothing. Accident over at Otis's station. I'll call you when I know more. Not much is an accident around here these days. Be careful. Go to bed. Check out those pumps over there. What are you doin' here? This is my jurisdiction. Hey there, Charlie. Glad you could finally make it. I think we've got ourselves a terrible accident here. Get your men out of here, Walter. This is a potential crime scene. I don't need you muckin' it up. Not very hospitable, Charlie. I'm just tryin' to help. Help who? Your brother? Now get the hell out of here. You know, I try to respect my elders. But you make it a full day's work. You enjoy that badge while you have it, old man, 'cause come November, it's mine. Let's go, boys. Sheriff Prescott has the scene now. Was that Walter and the boys I just seen? Yeah. How long do you figure they were here before you got in? Farmer said about a half hour. Means they were here before I even got the call. Well, not much chance of finding anything useful then? Half an hour's not nearly enough time for that dumbass to cover something up. You find any body parts? I hear Nate wore false teeth. Why don't you shut up, Herb? So, no bodies, no pump? Whole place burned to shit. Prescott's got nothing, right? It ain't that simple, Harvey. I think maybe... Maybe we should just back off for a while. Let this whole thing blow over. What the fuck am I payin' you for, Walter? Take care of it. Make it go away. It's what you do. It's out of my jurisdiction. Why are you such a fuckin' pussy? It's no wonder Daddy liked me best. Look. Little accident like this, okay... Have to close up shop. People start losin' respect. It's time we turned up the heat. Whoo! That's right. Look, come here. Come here. Three weeks from now, this thing goes public, okay? We lock down as much land as we can, and that's it. Finish line. This county is ours. You and me. All right? All right? What do you say? Charlie. Charlie. Hey. What are you doin' here? Well, this is still a barbershop, ain't it? Well, yeah. I do some of my best thinkin' in this chair. Yeah? Think on this right here. Three down. Himalayan bovine. Yak. Yak. Hear anything about Otis sellin' out and movin' on? Yeah. Heard Harvey made him an offer. Not gettin' any better, is it? No. So, what do you want me to do with this? I just cut it two days ago. Just pretend. You know, I been thinkin', Charlie. Maybe you shouldn't run for re-election. You should just give up the fight. Let somebody else deal with him. Is that what folks around here want? Just to give up? Well, truth is, most of them already have. Hey, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Easy, girl. Easy. Easy. Easy. Come on, girl. Come on. Easy. Come here. Come on. Easy. Easy. There you go. It's all right. No one's gonna hurt you. No one's gonna hurt you. Take it easy. Here we go. Show us something, Nicky. There. There you go. You got it now, Nick. I see you still got a way with the ladies. What? Did you forget that it's a whole lot easier to ride them after they're broke? That's why you gotta get them while they're young. Otherwise, they turn old and stubborn. So, what are you doing way down here? On my way to Dallas. Just thought I'd say hey. How's Ma? She's wonderin' when she's gonna see you. You got a minute? Harvey's got the whole town runnin' scared. Walter and his boys don't even pretend to be law enforcement anymore. Well, they weren't fooling anyone even when they were pretending. Well, this time they screwed up. I can feel it. I've got an appointment with the F.B.I. over in Dallas. See if I can wrangle up some help. Does Hap know about this? Sounds like you're stirring up a hornet's nest. Somebody's gotta do something. Yeah, somebody's gotta do something. You got something you wanna say? You really believe you're gonna make a difference? These guys don't give a shit about your badge. They never have. Sometimes, Son, all you got is what you believe in. I'm on the clock. I've been thinkin' about headin' to the lake this weekend, do a little fishin'. Maybe you could come down. Pretty busy.

Business must be slow? Okay. Yeah, but I thought, you know, I made you a pretty fair offer, there, last week and I'm not too sure why you told Herb to fuck off. Yeah. Look at me. Look at me. Jack, I am a reasonable man. Okay? And I'm always, always willin' to negotiate. Now, are you sure you wanna keep this place? Are you still set on that? Is that really how you feel? Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, Jack. I am. I'll see you around. At most, this is a homicide with no witnesses and a dead suspect. It's not federal. Well, if it was a routine delivery, why was he murdered? It all goes back to Morris and his brother. Sheriff Prescott, I'm sorry, but the Bureau just doesn't buy into this whole Dixie Mafia thing. It's a clever tag that some reporter hung on a bunch of rednecks robbing liquor stores to get a story. Miss Jensen, I've been Sheriff of Shelton County for almost 30 years. Most of that time, things have been pretty quiet. Good, decent people livin' productive lives. But the last couple of years, it's been like livin' in hell. These people are organized, and I'm not gonna shut them down on my own. This is the first piece of physical evidence I've had since longer than I can remember. Now, it may seem like nothing to you, but to me, it just might be the thing that puts an end to the terror. All I'm asking is that you run ballistics. Bring me something, anything that makes this a federal crime, and I'll see what I can do. Thank you for your time. Detective Michaels. Charlie Prescott. Been a long time. How you doin', Pete? I'm good. Listen, I really need a favor. Why don't we step in here. We'll talk about it. Here's my reservation. We'll take care of it. Don't worry about a thing. Gentlemen. Hope I'm not interrupting. Senator, Detective Michaels. We met last year at the police auxiliary. Pete, why don't we step to the bar? Give these gentlemen some privacy. Guess who stopped by to see me this afternoon? Dewar's. Neat. Comin' right up, sir. Charlie Prescott. Wanted me to run ballistics on a gun they found at that barbecue they had down at the Boone last week. What did you get? Registered to a Walter Morris, Boone City Police. Cash. Stupid frickin' hillbillies. Did you send it out? I'm poor, I'm not stupid. I figured you'd want me to bury it. What did you tell Prescott? I told him it'd take at least a month. Can anyone track this? Not for the right price. Take it. Fax it to Harvey, tell him that Prescott kept the gun and has a copy of the report. What about the gun? Get rid of it. Forget you ever saw it. I'll take care of your end tomorrow. This does not prove anything. You told me they had nothing, okay? That everything was toast. Well, I squeezed them, and that's what his boy told me. Then what the fuck am I doin' with paperwork That says Nate's gun belongs to you? I don't know. "I don't know." "I don't know." You fat fuck. Barney Fife has a ballistic report that ties you to a crime scene. All right? Now, it is one small leap from you to me, and I'm not about to let that happen. Piece of shit. Hello, Crystal. I can't believe you're back. What are you doin' here? You look hot. Did you miss me? Keeping yourself out of trouble? Yeah, I have to, since you're not here to bail me out. So, how long you stayin'? Got my own place now. A few days. Do some fishing with the old man. Two BLTs on wheat, two egg salads on rye, and a sweet tea and a lemonade. You got a new girlfriend, don't you? What's her name? I bet she's pretty. I'll kill her. I'll kill her. It's good to see some things don't change. There he is. Hook, line, and sinker. Yeah? We got him. Hey, Mom. Hey, stranger. It's good to see you. Yeah. You too. Sorry. I've been busy. We're comin' up on Highway 15. What the hell is this? Hi, Charlie. What's up, buddy? What the hell? Are you crazy? Come on, man. Let's go. You wanna party a little? Come on. Son of a bitch. Close, isn't it? Whoo! What are you doin'? Hit the motherfucker. Come on. Race him! Come on. Crazy son of a bitch. Where you goin'? Got you now. Yes, I do. Box the old bastard in. Come on, box him in. Must be chicken. Are you? All right, boys. You wanna play? Come on. I'll play. Fuck, dude. You gotta watch out.

Mrs. Prescott? Hi. I'm Agent Kate Jensen with the F.B.I. I met your husband last week. I'm very sorry for your loss. I'm sorry no one would listen to him. Mitch, take her to the car. We'll catch up. Go ahead. So why you interested now? Dead cop suddenly make this federal? No, your mom's right. I didn't do anything. But your father made an impression on me. So, I thought I at least owed him a few questions. What do you want to know? What can you tell me about the Morris brothers? They grew up around here. Walter was a good boy, Harvey always in trouble. Little things as a kid, then progressively worse. Five years ago, he killed a guy in a bar fight, got 15 years for manslaughter. It should have been first degree. So, while Harvey's in Huntsville, Walter made some friends and got himself appointed city police chief. Then, three years into his sentence, Harvey miraculously gets paroled. Came back to town. Then, in a couple of months, he's runnin' the truckin' yard for DCB. Started throwin' money around, buyin' up land and local businesses. Yeah. Nobody knows where he got the cash. And if an owner didn't sell, he'd mysteriously have an accident. Anyone willing to press charges? Testify? Most are so afraid, they don't even talk about what's goin' on. So, Charlie was trying to stop them. Did what he could. Dad mostly just spun his wheels. I take it you don't share your father's optimism. Look what it got him. Justice is about two things, power and money. With them, you can get away with just about anything. I was just thinkin' about the first time Charlie ran for sheriff. No one gave him a chance in hell of winnin'. He was up against Red Myers. Red had been sheriff forever, which was his only qualification for the job. All Charlie wanted was one vote. Just one. He always said that's how he got elected. People wanted him to at least get that one vote, none of them realizin' that everybody else was doin' the same thing. When they tallied it all up, Charlie won in a landslide. It's been mostly landslides ever since. Let's sell this place. Get out of here. That's grief talking. It's not the same anymore. Another five years, we'll be a part of Dallas. I can't take that. Let's leave on our own terms. Come on, Hap. You know as well as I do, the system's broken. At least with a badge, you can poke around without Walter breathin' down your neck. You really think you're gonna make a difference? You know, personally, bein' sheriff is the last thing I want, but I swore an oath, and this town deserves somebody fightin' for 'em. You're as bad as Charlie. You think you're so different? Mick. Two Buds. You got a problem? No problem here, Master Sheriff. 6 bucks. First round's on the house. You heard the man. $6. You bartendin' now, Hero? Picking up a little spending money as a bouncer. You sure you're up for a job like that? No helmet, none of them fancy green soldier outfits? Walk away without paying for those, I guess we'll find out. You know, truth is, Hero, I'd pay a hell of a lot more than 6 bucks for a chance to kick your ass. Maybe today's your lucky day. Really. I was serious. You're gonna have to pay for these. 6 bucks? Are you really that cheap? Apparently so. Asshole. Why don't you boys get together? Save the county some money on ammo. That'll be $6. No tip? All right, everybody. Drinks are on the house. Here's your beers. Should I ask what the hell you think you're doin'? Something. Just somebody doing something. Okay, John. We'll see you in Maui in a couple of weeks. Give my love to Betty Lou and the kids. Bye-bye. You willing to back a cop killer? It was an accident, Lou. Prescott lost control. That is crap and you know it. They haven't charged anybody. Doesn't mean he didn't do it. Means they can't prove he did. Seems like a net gain to me. I mean, no more Andy Griffith sniffin' around. Besides, Morris tells me he's gonna get his brother appointed county sheriff. You've been talking to Morris? We called a couple of times. Just shootin' the shit. It's your call. Be careful who you make an enemy, Lou. Man doing the dirty work, he's always the most valuable. So he spanked you? Four on one? The old deputy had a gun, Harvey. The gun came out after Prescott kicked your asses, right? Lie to me again, Herb, and I'll shoot you myself. The good news is this stupid fuck just put himself into play. All right? Now... Anyone that misses an opportunity to teach this fuckin' prick a lesson again is done here. You understand? All right, Steve, stay here and watch the phones. Boys, let's go buy ourselves a hardware store. All right? Guy was .20, way over the limit. But he was rich. Had friends in high places. Got off with a fine and community service. She and Nick had only been married for two years. I think he blamed Charlie for not pushin' hard enough. Well, it's definitely not a perfect system. Didn't expect to see you again. Mind your manners and sit down. Listen to what she found. I did some digging. DCB Transport is owned by a man named Traxel Byrne, based in Dallas. He's rich, politically connected, made his fortune in trucking and road construction. But he's not particularly proud of it. Everything runs through a maze of shell corporations. Silent partners, offshore accounts, but nothing illegal. It was one of their tankers that blew last week, and your father didn't think it was an accident. Word was, Harvey made an offer on Otis's place. But why blow the place up with one of your own tankers? Especially if you want to buy it. I think these will work just perfect. Thanks, Frank. It'll be $20. Thank you. Hey, Frank. How's business? You boys plannin' on payin' for those tools? Come on, Frank. What type of people do you think we are? You know, I've been thinkin' about your offer to sell this place, Frank. I didn't make any offer. If we can come to terms and a price, you got yourself a quick deal. I'm not interested in sellin'. My dad started this store and left it to me. I plan on leavin' it to my son. Ain't you a good daddy, Frank? Yeah. Well, you know kids today, Frank. The second they get to leave this town, they hightail it to the big city. Ungrateful little bastards. Not one of them appreciates the hard work their daddies put in to buildin' a business in this town, right? But I appreciate what you done, Frank. I do. I do and I know how hard it is to compete against them big fuckin' conglomerates who got no respect for the local businessmen. That's why we're gonna make a good team, Frank. Yeah, I tell you what. You man the counter while me and the boys, we just make sure, you know, the locals do their hardware shoppin' here. Thank you, but my business isn't for sale. Everything's for sale, Frank. It's just a matter of us comin' to terms. What's that expression that they use? I would... I'd give my right arm to own a place like this? In your case, Frank, it ain't an expression no more, is it? Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't look good. Whoo! Janice. Frank. How you feeling? Good as can be expected, I guess. Janice, do you mind if I speak with Frank for a minute? I don't have much to say. Like I told Hap, it was an accident. Please. Go on, honey. You wanna let Harvey Morris steal your business, take away everything you've worked for, you know, that's your call, and under the circumstances, I can't say that I blame you. You see, the problem is Charlie couldn't look the other way. Frank, I know it ain't easy, but it would help a lot if you'd press charges. You know, give Hap something to go after Morris with. Let him beat the law again? You know better than anyone, the system's broke. Besides, I've got a family to think about. And I'm asking you to think about them, and every other family in the town. If Hap can stop him now, it would give folks a chance to live their lives again. Ain't your fight, Nick. Hell, you don't even live here anymore. It's like I said. It was an accident. Okay. Dr. Klein. Paging Dr. Klein. Telephone please, Dr. Klein. Freeze. Ho! Ho! Easy. It's me. You tryin' to get yourself killed? Vengeance ain't the answer, Nick. Today, it is. Nick. Where you goin'? Finish what my father started. Well, if you're gonna go... At least take this. Your father gave me my badge. He said, "Wear it with pride and walk tall." I got some county son of a bitch pullin' me over. I don't know. I'll call you back, let you know. That motherfucker. Step out of the truck. License, registration and load manifest. Well, now, that's quite a step up from bouncer, ain't it, Hero? Step out of the truck. Says here you're carrying a full load. On my way to pick it up. Where? What the fuck do you care where? Call me curious. Now, where are you picking up? Pipeline up north or the refinery south of Dallas? The refinery down south. It's a little late to be picking up a load way down there, isn't it? I do as much of my drivin' as possible at night, Hero. Veteran lawmen appreciate us keepin' these babies off the road durin' daylight hours. Well, that's mighty considerate of you. Drive safe. I will. What? You ain't gonna believe it. Prescott's playin' Sheriff. He pulled me over. He's still followin' me now. If I don't go south, he'll know I lied to him. He's wearin' a badge? And carryin' a fuckin' shotgun. Sawed off. Cocky as I've ever seen him. Well, what do you want me to do? Okay, listen to me. All right? You keep goin' south till you fuckin' lose him. All right? Now, I don't give a shit if you have to go all the way to fuckin' Mexico. Do you understand me? Get the fuck off me. Hey, Hap. Nice boots. I ain't marrin' up my new boots 'cause you've got a hunch. What are we lookin' for, anyway? I don't know. You're the cop. You tell me. Well, let's get to lookin', I guess. Well, Dan, seems like we got ourselves a little pickle here. You know, Charlie's untimely death has left this county without a sheriff, and, well, seems a little unsafe, if you ask me. Well, I spoke with the other council members, and we figure we'd just let the deputy's department handle things until November. That's a good idea. You know, I got a better idea, though. Why don't you call the boys, have a little meeting, and appoint an interim sheriff. You know, I'd expect Walter, here, he'd make an excellent choice, wouldn't he? 10 a.m. Wednesday? Does that work for you? I mean, Herb and I will make sure that everyone shows up on time. ♪ Keep your eye on the money, daddy said This is useless, Hap. Let's go get something to eat.

Yeah, Walter was in here earlier, braggin' about how he was gonna fire both your asses after the county board names him sheriff. You ever hear of a little thing called an election? Harvey's leanin' on the council. Hard. He wants Walter appointed interim sheriff. Meeting's tomorrow at 10 a.m. We're makin' progress with this F.B.I. woman. We just need a little more time. That's all. We got no choice, Hap. You can't protect everyone. Our kids? I loaded my family up this afternoon. Sent them up to the in-laws. Forget it, Hap. They don't deserve your concern. Charlie died for a bunch of saplings, too afraid to stand up for themselves. That ain't fair, Emma. I loved Charlie just as much as anybody here, but we might be better off if he'd just left things alone. That's right. Standing up to him, that's what caused the violence. Don't you dare blame this on him! You cowardly sons of bitches! All of you! Just go upstairs. Okay? No! I'm stayin'. Okay. You know, we really appreciate what you guys are tryin' to do. But if we back you against Walter, it becomes war, and most likely, we'll be the first casualties. I mean, you saw what happened to Frank, Eric... Verlyn. Join your family. Get out of town. Tonight. All of you, take your families and leave. Don't let anyone know where you're going, not even each other. It takes a quorum to put the board meeting together, right? Well, if you're all gone, then no one can name the interim sheriff. Just give us a week. If we don't take Morris down by then, then I'll quit, let you do it your way. Maybe it would be best to let things cool down a bit. Get your ducks in a row. Look, I'm not gonna let it end like this. You know, losers like Harvey Morris only know one thing, to take and keep on taking. Waiting a couple more months? Keeping quiet? He's gonna own each and every one of us. Someone has to stop him. One week. I'll be around if you need me. Mitch, we can't protect you if you stay. Look, I'm no hero, but I'm not gonna run, either. See you tomorrow. Yeah, see you. I want you to leave, too. This is my home. You know, a couple of days ago, you were ready to sell this place and never look back. There's a difference between leavin' and bein' run off. I knew it. We need to find out who blabbed. Damn it! I founded the company 35 years ago. Started out with one truck and three strong backs. Five years straight, I'd come home every day smellin' like tar. I built this business up, one road at a time. We primarily do rebuilding projects now, interstates, public works. Byrne Construction is the largest, most respected builder in Texas. The state keeps you pretty busy. Well, layin' tar isn't exactly country club work. Most folks would rather do something more glamorous. Well, actually, we're here about DCB Transport. I believe you own that company, as well? I own a lot of companies. Most of 'em I see on a spreadsheet every quarter. I just have a few questions about Harvey Morris, the man who runs your yard in Shelton County. That's a separate division. If you need information on the day-to-day, I suggest you go directly to the source. The source isn't cooperating. Miss Jensen, I'll tell you whatever you want to know. But as much as I'd like to say I slap on a pair of tar pants and go out there and mix it up with the boys doin' the hard work, I can't. They keep me cooped up in these air conditioned offices, makin' deals. Guess I'm just too good at it. Well, at least you're not covered in tar anymore. Thank you for your time. My pleasure. Take care. You too. Would it be all right if we asked one of the boys doing the hard work to send me a copy of the shipping manifest for Mr. Morris's trucks? Do you have a warrant? Do we need one? I'm sure that can be arranged. Good. Thank you. Hey, anything useful? Too slippery, but he's definitely hiding something. Any luck with the Dallas PD? Nobody logged in the gun, but a friend of mine ran a memory report for the fax machine in ballistics. Looks like a cop named Pete Michaels faxed Harvey something the morning Charlie was killed. Did you get a copy?Nah. Walter's got all the DAs in his back pocket. No way we're getting a search warrant. Well, what about Pete Michaels? What about him? You can flash the federal badge around him and see if he twitches. Besides the fact this isn't even a formal investigation yet, I could lose my job for that. Not to mention, I'm late for my daughter's recital. Daughter? Well, I do have a life outside the Bureau. Yeah, I just... I didn't realize you were married. Divorced. My daughter tolerates the hours. My husband couldn't. Listen, we're making progress, okay? A couple more days will make this federal. We don't have a few more days. No, we don't. I didn't count on Prescott's son pickin' up the torch. He wouldn't have, if Harvey had left well enough alone. Clean it up. All of it. And, Lou... Make damn sure everything lands on Morris's doorstep. Missed you boys at the council meeting this morning. I thought you'd be there for sure, fight for your jobs and all. But then again, you didn't have to be, since everybody just kind of upped and disappeared. Lucky us. You know, this town, Prescott... There can only be one big dog. Everybody else just kind of... They sniff. Really? You see, I always figured that someone, somewhere, had a leash on you, Harvey. You are writin' checks that that badge can't cash, Prescott. Don't worry. I plan on taking it off long before I cash anything. Watch your backs, boys. Fireworks start tonight. I don't know about you, Hap, but I've always liked fireworks. Hello, Pete. I need the gun. What gun? The one that Prescott gave you. You told me to get rid of it. But you didn't, did you? Hi, Crystal. Get out! Get out of here! Get out! A real help! Get out! Get out of here! Get out! Yeah, I'm pretty sure if they get that secondary fixed up, they're gonna be number one. - Yeah. Mitch! Mitch! Look where we are. Hey. See, the way I see it... All right? If you had kept your mouth shut, then Walter, well, he would have been sheriff in this shit-hole little county. Then I wouldn't have to come here in this pretty little trailer of yours and pay a visit. But you see, when you're playin' politics, okay, you got to be careful. Because 9 times out of 10, okay, 9 times out of 10, you get fucked. I got first dibs. Get her over here. No! Come on. Get her down! My God. I'm sure gonna put a smile on her face! Come here! Get her. Hold it! Get her! Get her! That's it. Get him off. Hello? They killed Mitch. Who? Those bastards killed Mitch. He was Charlie's best friend and they killed him. Turn on your TV. What channel? Doesn't matter. Any one. Hey, I was watching that. ...and leaving two people dead. The investigation continues, but city officials now believe that tonight's explosion was the result of a natural gas leak. Are you all right? I'm going after Michaels. Find out what he knows. Nick? Don't do this. Just give me a little more time. I don't have any more time! Shit! Mom, you said "shit." Honey, come on. We got to go. Stay. Don't move. Kate, get back in the car. Come on, Nick. Don't do this. Get out of my way. You know what? Anything you find in there is inadmissible in court. Like I care. Hey! This isn't just about you anymore. There's other people involved here. He isn't gonna stop unless we do something about it right now. Let me ask him a few questions. Please. Where's Harvey? I ain't his fuckin' babysitter. I've got something that's gonna help with Prescott. Nick. It was open. Lieutenant Michaels? Kate Jensen, F.B.I. Just wanna ask you a few questions. Nick. Crystal. It's kind of like a bad dream, ain't it? It's over now. Yeah. Take a good look, okay? 'Cause I want you to make a positive ID, and you pass it on to Hero for me, okay? You do that for me? All right. Look, you got some blood on your lip. It's okay. A little bit of ice will take the swellin' down. Well, then. There you go. I wanted to make sure all the loose ends were wrapped up with Prescott. Well, now, I don't think we're gonna need any help with Prescott, but... What the hell are you doin', Lou? Sorry, Walter. Too many loose ends. No. Wait, wait. Lou, don't do this. You know, Harvey will come after you. He ain't gonna sleep till he gets his revenge. I'm counting on that. Except, he won't be looking for me. Prescott. He's an easy mark. Worst case, Harvey kills Prescott, gets nailed for it. Best case, Harvey and Prescott kill each other. Either way, Harvey's out of my life for good. We were here to question him about a joint F.B.I.-Shelton County investigation. That's it. Prescott. When? Who did this to you? Tell me he did it. Crystal, it's okay. They'll kill you. Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of this. Wait for me at the house. Where are you goin'? To collect some evidence. Why'd I even ask? We're closed. I got a warrant. Hey, what the hell you think you're doin' here? I have a meeting with Harvey. This here's private property. I'm gonna have to ask you to vacate the premises immediately. Which one is Harvey's office? Put the weapons down. What, this or this? Put the weapons down, now! Whatever you say. All right. Let's try this one more time. Which one is Harvey Morris's office? Sorry, man. I got a severe case of amnesia. Really? 'Cause I have a cure for that. Take a rest. What you lookin' for, Sheriff Prescott? You are so fuckin' dead. You are so fuckin' dead. Harvey gonna be gettin' you, boy. Look, there it is! Little love note from your mommy! You say one more word and you are dead. Come here. Come here! What's the map for? What is the map for? Good morning. For some. Walter, it's me. Open up. Is he watchin' porn again? Pull your pants up, you dirty bastard! Why is this door locked? I haven't seen him all morning. His cruiser's outside. Walter? You fuckin' piece of shit! It's an interstate, right through here. So, Byrne uses Harvey to buy up the land he knows the state will pay top dollar for. The announcement goes public next week. At a bonus, Harvey buys up the local businesses, knowing the town is gonna boom once the interstate is done. Holy shit. We got him. Where'd you get this? You know what? I don't wanna know. Yeah? You surprise me. What, did your badge get too heavy? Harvey. Yeah, I guess it ain't the same when they pin them on your chest? What do you want? I just want to let you know that I got your message loud and clear. What message? Don't you play dumb with me. You insult me. Now, truth is, Walter was weak. He was. And I'll bet he squealed like a little bitch when you killed him, didn't he? Yeah. Yeah. Just like your daddy did when I torched him in his car. Harvey, where are you? Question is, where are you? You at your momma's house? Or is she all alone? Listen to me, Harvey. I didn't kill Walter, I swear. Harvey. Harvey? Get in the car. Come on, Hap! Pick up the phone, God damn it! Pick up the phone! I want her alive. Come on. Come on. Get to the barn and stay down. Come with me, Hap. Please! Go, Emma, now! Go! They're goin' to the barn! I hate it when Tonto tries to be a hero. Mom? Hap! Nick! I guess you got my message. She better be alive. Nick, don't let him blackmail you! Don't give him what he wants! No matter what it is! Don't give him... Stop her fuckin' touchin' me. She's a tough old bird. I see where you get your soldier-boy spirit from now. What do you want? I want the same thing you want. I want this to end. This is what we're gonna do. You will resign. The county board will name me interim sheriff, and you and the old lady will leave town. Now, if I see one cop, Prescott, she is dead. You understand me? I'll need until tomorrow to get all the council members back to town. Twelve noon tomorrow. If there ain't a quorum, you are planning a funeral. Come on. Come on! Get away! Get in there. Nick, let me try again. Get us some help. They'll kill her. You're a cop. You can't just go in there, guns blazing. I tried it Charlie's way, now I've got to do it my way. I'm sorry. All right, what can I do to help? You've done enough. Just go home and take care of your daughter. Kate, there is one thing. You can take that map. Make Byrne pay...for Charlie. Be careful! He's gone mad. He's leading them right to it. Our own man! Don't wait for the train. Do it now. Okay, Bess. Let's do this. I was right. There is something going on. You've got to do it, boy. You've got to do it now! You hear somethin'? Sounded like a pony. A pony? You crazy? Howie? What the fuck? Don't hurt me, man. Please don't hurt me. Hey, girl. You lost? What are you doin' here? Where's your owner? What the hell? What do you... You are under arrest for the rape of Crystal Wood. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say... I thought you'd waive your rights. Are you okay? I'm okay. He's here. Who? Hero. Check the gadget. Jimmy and the boys will check the place. Well, what if he already got... Just do it! Daryl! Howie! Get your ass out here! We got a problem! Jimmy? Come out so I can see you, you fuck! Get the fuck in here! You are scum! You are the lowest of the low! Give me your fuckin' hand. Go ahead! Do it! You're not gonna get away with this! Shut up! I'm not afraid of you! None of us are afraid of you! Shut the fuck up! I'll tell you, your boy made a big mistake, okay? I'm gonna drag him in here and shoot him right in front of you. How do you feel about that? Your little boy? See? Now, that's the problem with firing at an unseen enemy. You waste too many damn bullets! Special ops training says you should be able to reload in less than three seconds. That should give you just about the same odds that you gave Hap and Crystal. 1001, 1002, 1003. Never turn your back on the enemy. They forget to teach you that in special ops, Nick? Drop the gun and turn around. You got a hearin' problem? Let my mother go. Ain't that sweet? A little mama's boy till the end? You let her walk out of here, and I'll give serious thought to not killing you. I got an idea. How about I bring her out here, shoot her right in her fuckin' face in front of you... Drop the gun! Who the fuck are you? F.B.I. It's over, Morris. Hey, you're cute. I said drop it, now! You know, Nick, you give a bitch a badge and she thinks she owns the place? Sweetheart, okay, you better drop your weapon, otherwise it's gonna get real ugly out here. Kate, just shoot him!Shut up! It's your call. Damn. You go get Emma. She's inside. Take Bess and get the hell out of here. No. You're coming with me. I'll see you later. Emma! I'm in here! Look away! Look away! Let's go. We have to find Nick! I told you I'd take that badge off before I cashed the check. I didn't think you had it in you. Kill a man in cold blood. I'm pretty sure ballistics will say that's your bullet in his chest. Of course, those reports don't always end in justice being served. So that was your plan? Bring me in on suspicion of murder? For starters, yeah. Might have been tough, you know? No weapons. No evidence. A lot of loopholes, Nick. You're right. Maybe we should settle this here. See who is really the big dog. So, what do you say, Harvey?
