The planet won't survive much longer. [Lara] Are you sure about this? [Jor-El] I'm afraid it's the only way. [stirring music playing] [rumbling] Krypton is about to die. [whines] But you, dear son, will live on. [whining] -[baby crying] -[barking] [Jor-El] Krypto, no! [whining] [barks] [sniffing] [barks] Oh! Krypto! [laughing] No. Our boy will need a friend. Watch over our son. [dramatic music playing] [rumbling] [Krypto whimpering] [sentimental music playing] [crying] [crying stops] [baby cooing] [snoring] [barks] -[mischievous music playing] -[Clark continues snoring] [whines] All right, wake up, buddy. It is walk-o'clock. [objects clattering] Maybe I should let him sleep? Okay, I let him sleep. -[Krypto yawning] -[Clark continues snoring] [Krypto] All right. [snoring loudly] -[thumps] -[muffled snoring] This is unpleasant for both of us. -[barks] -[Clark] No. No, no. No, no. [whines] Hmm. [Clark mumbling] Five more... Five more minutes. -[thuds] -[mischievous music stops] And I'm up. Okay, Krypto. -We'll go for a walk. -[barking] ["you're my best friend" by Queen playing] [panting] [yawning] Whoa! ♪ Ooh you make me live ♪ ♪ Whatever this world can give to me ♪ ♪ It's you you're all I see ♪ [barking] ♪ Ooh you make me live ♪ -[siren blaring] -♪ You're the best friend ♪ ♪ That I ever had ♪ -[robbers laughing] -♪ I've been with you such a long time ♪ ♪ You're my sunshine and I want you to know ♪ -[both] Huh? -[groans] ♪ ...I really love you ♪ -[growling] -♪ Oh you're the best friend ♪ ♪ Ooh you make me live ♪ ♪ Whenever this world is cruel to me ♪ ♪ I got you to help me forgive ♪ ♪ Ooh you make me live ♪ [all gasp] [all sigh in relief] [all gasp] ♪ ...that I ever had ♪ ♪ You know I'll never be lonely ♪ -♪ You're my only one ♪ -[barks] ♪ And I love the things ♪ ♪ I really love the things that you do ♪ [barks, whines] ♪ Oh you're my best friend ♪ [reporter] Mister Mxyzptlk has finally been defeated. Turns out, he just needed to say his name backwards. From Metropolis, I'm Lois Lane. [Superman] Hey, Lois. I know you like these, so I got you one from actual Paris. -[chuckles] -[romantic music playing] I don't know why I said it like that. And I got you one of these from 43rd Street. Which is, like, a full three blocks out of my way. During rush hour? Wow, that's like me flying to Mars. [Lois] What? You can fly? I always thought the cape was just a cute accessory. Oh! So you think I'm cute. I said the cape was cute. [sighs] You think I'm cute. Are we lickin' faces right now? Because if we're lickin' faces, I gotta get in on... -[barking] -[romantic music stops] Oh, what do I have here? -[toy squeaking] -[gasps] Squeezy Bruce! -Fetch! -[barks] Pup, up and away! [laughs] Okay, where were we? [Krypto] Squeezy Bruce retrieved. Hey, those guys look fun. How about you go play with them? [amusing music playing] So I'm eating my own vomit, and then the... So, I'm eating my own... So I'm... I'm... I see you've retreated to your Batcave, but nobody can hide from the long snoot of justice. Hmm. And then I says, "If you don't want me rubbing my butt in the carpet, get hardwood floors." [crashing] [Krypto] Squeezy Bruce has been retrieved. Wait, do you know who this is? It's Krypto the Superdog. Okay. [chuckles] You can have my pawtograph. [mud squelches] Listen, I'm afraid I gotta keep it to just one, or I'll be signing all day. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta get this back to my boy. -[Foofy] He doesn't want it. -[Krypto] I'm sorry, what? Mr. Outside-Underpants. He doesn't want the toy. He's trying to get rid of ya. What? That's ridiculous. Superman and I are inseparable. I'm his ride or die. Oh, yeah? Where you, uh, sleeping these days? I sleep in bed with Supes. Except when Lois stays over, then I have to move to my extra special spot on the floor. [amusing music stops] Brutal. Same thing happened to me. Nancy got a fiancee and it was all over. That's French for "Bye-bye, dog." Yeah, well, you don't get Supes like I get Supes. I mean, sure, the guy dates, but he will never love anyone except for... [gasps] [in slow motion] I love you. [ominous music playing] [breathing heavily] [whimpering] [ominous music fades] Um, are you okay? Me? Yes, I'm... I'm fine. I am fine. I'm totally... Fine? All right, good talk. Pound it out. [screams] This might sound crazy, but now that we're together, I think Krypto feels left out? [Krypto whines] Yeah. I guess I'm, kind of, his only friend. That's sweet. But maybe he'd be happier if he had a new friend, too. [upbeat music playing] Good morning, friends. [panting] So it begins. Like clockwork, Carl will try to flirt with Patty. Ooh! Is that new perfume? It's cat pee. And have zero game. Giving this handsome canine just enough time to-- What you doin', Ace? I'm bustin' loose, PB. Sick of this whole cage situation. Oh, my goddess. This is just like when Wonder Woman used her Bracelets of Submission to escape Doctor Poison's secret hideout. [grunting] Like... this! Okay. Not exactly like this. What if the rescue lady catches you? And locks you in the back room? Where they only listen to smooth jazz. Relax, Chip. I got my girl, Merton, running lookout. These peepers don't miss a thing. If the rescue lady's coming, you'll know it. Perfect. Because I almost got myself out of the... [Patty] Nope. [Merton] I think the rescue lady's coming! Thanks, Merton. That's a... that's a good catch. I'm rooting for you, Ace. But don't you wanna get adopted and feel the warm embrace of a middle-aged person who lives alone? Yeah. Who will be your new best friend. You're my best friends, dummies. And you're all coming with me to the farm. [gasps] I love when he talks about the farm! -The farm upstate. -[uplifting music playing] An untamed paradise where animals run free and they love and protect one another. And the lettuce grows on trees. [Merton gasps] No shelter lady watching our every move. Nope. It's a 100% animal farm. That doesn't sound ominous at all. It's perfect. And when I get us all outta here, well, that's where we're gonna go. -[animal] The dog is right. -[uplifting music fades] He should seek his freedom. You see that? Lulu gets it. And he must destroy -all who stand in his way! -[sinister music playing] Wow. Well, that just took a turn. You may kid yourself with your silly farm, but I have the device! For, one day soon, when the stars align, the device will bring me ultimate power and I will be more than free! [all] "Will be more than free!" -Exactly. -[sinister music stops] Lulu, whatever they tested on you in that lab, left you a few guineas short of a pig. That device is just a pile of garbage. You fear my brilliance. [scoffs] Recede into shadows. Recede into shadows. Maintain eye contact. Recede into shadows. [Clark] All right, boy, I'll be right back with a surprise. And I will remain here, posing under my secret identity. [whimsical music playing] Bark Kent. So, what is new with you, fellow normal dog? Uh, I bit the FedEx guy the other day. Ah, fine job. Who was he working for? General Zod? The Legion of Doom? FedEx. Of course! The federation of exes. Not to be trusted. [bird cawing] [scatting nervously] What is taking my owner so long? So, Mr. Kent, you're looking for another pet, huh? Well, my dog's the best. [chuckles] But I've got this girlfriend. [chuckles] And I'm gonna ask her to marry me tonight. -Aw! -[gags] -Congratulations. -Thanks! But he doesn't know that yet, and I just think maybe he needs a friend of his own. Well, then I think Ace here would be the perfect... [gasps] How do you feel about guinea pigs? [adventurous music playing] I'll come back for all of you guys after closing. Stay strong. [grunting] There we go. -[screeching] -[metallic clang] [Ace groans] Oh, man, that hurt. Yes. And that hurt me as well. Due to the fact that I feel pain as any ordinary canine would. [amusing music playing] Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm kind of in the middle of a prison break, so could you please...? Prison break? Stop right there and cease your unlawful activities, dog I've never met. The heck are you talking about, man? You the same dog that was literally just behind me. Impossible. That dog wore glasses. Now surrender, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, okay, so you wanna take it there. You wanna throw paws, then fine. But I should warn you, I'm one-eighth Boxer. [amusing music stops] And seven-eighths Chihuahua. Chihuahuas are vicious. Take that. Take a little bit of this. [grunts] Tap out, and I'll let you out. -[yawns, smacks lips] -Here come the thunder! You're gonna get it! Ahhh! Oh, man. I'm getting a stitch. Yeah, I gotta take a knee. Oh, if I didn't get this stitch, I had you where I wanted you. [gasping] Banana! Get me... Get me a banana! Hurry up! [grunts] That's cold, man. Aw! Aren't you a little ray of sunshine? -[dog barking] -What? Oh, Krypto. Oh, you think you're so great, don't you, Superdog? You think your dookie don't stink. My dookie doesn't stink. Wait, wait, time out. Are you serious, right now? Yep, it actually smells like sandalwood. It's borderline aromatherapy, if I'm being honest. [grunts, laughs] Whoa! Whoa! You ain't normal, man. Yeah, well, at least I have an owner. [scoffs] You can't own me. I'm a wild animal. Exactly. So, let's get you back in the cage. Supes is probably missing me. Missing? [laughs] The dude tied you up to the stop sign and went into that shelter to buy you a new friend so that you'd give him some space. -[Carl] Gotcha. -[Ace groans] Superman would never do that. Well, it's literally happening right now. [grunts] I'm just glad that that new friend ain't me. Easy, Carl. Stop acting like you don't know me. [grunts] -[Carl grunts] -Nice try, Houdini. [smooth jazz music playing on speaker] Well, you did say you'd come back for us. [sighs] [bell tinkling] Ooh, adoption time. One of us is gonna get someone to snuggle with. Yeah, don't get your hopes up. They always pick the... [meows] Here you go, baby. Wow! First day. Being a rescue animal is easy and fun! [sighs wearily] [melancholic music playing] Hey. You'll get 'em next time. Yeah. Next time. I can't believe that shelter punk said I wasn't normal. I'm a totally normal dog. [toilet flushes] [chuckles] And no way Superman was in there looking for a friend for me. ♪ I don't need a friend ♪ ♪ Supes is my friend ♪ ♪ My only friend is Superman ♪ [Superman] Hmm. [crashing] -What's that? -[barking] [dramatic music playing] Someone is dragging a meteor toward the city? [barking] -Luthor. -[growls] [Lex] Hello, gorgeous. Oh, how I have longed for you to enter my solar system. It's a rock. That rock, Mercy, is 100% orange kryptonite. Cool. Another kryptonite scheme. No, this is different! Green kryptonite takes away Superman's powers, but orange kryptonite -Will give me superpowers. -[device beeping] You know, like, uh, invisibility or, uh, laser-eyes, or throwing playing cards really hard. I'm finally gonna be stronger than that stupid-- You're not talking about me, are you? [barking] Yeah, I think he was talking about me, too. That's awkward. [Lex] Superman. I'd expected you and that mutt of yours -much sooner. -[growling] I'm gonna need you to let go of that meteor, Lex. Gladly. [tense music playing] -[baby laughing] -[both gasp] [people screaming] Krypto, fetch! [barking] [dramatic music playing] [car horn honking] [gasping] [yelps] -[people gasping] -[gasps] [man] That dog's a hero! Krypto! Good dog. Let's put this thing back in space where it belongs. Ma'am. Baby. [gasps] [baby grunts] [crying] [dramatic music swells] [Superman grunts] [laughing] Let's see if you can catch it now. [man 1 gasps] [man 2] Ah! [heroic music playing] [Superman] You forgot one thing, Lex. Unlike you, I have friends. -[upbeat music playing] -Thanks for building your stupid evil headquarters on the river. Very convenient for the water guy. I'm Aquaman! Oh, great. These jabronies. Uh, did somebody call tech support? Have you tried turning it off and on again? Thanks, buddy. Buddy? No, these people are work friends at best. Please fasten your safety belts. They are invisible. Yeah, none of this stuff is invisible. It's really more transparent. Hmm? I like your laser thing. But it looks better in green. [Mercy grunts] Yeah. [automated voice] LexCorp power suit engaged. Seat warmer activated. Best billion I ever spent. -[button beeps] -[hatch opens] All I need is one little piece. [grunts] Aw, bless your little heart. Did you think you were gonna get to it first? [crowd gasping] [Krypto] Thank you. [laughs] [grunts] [laughing maliciously] I am what I was always meant to become. -[upbeat music fades] -[grunts] [groans] Huh? What is this? But I'm supposed to have superpowers! [man clears throat] -They're overrated. -[grunts] -[upbeat music resumes] -[groans] -[barks] -[upbeat music fades] Good boy, Krypto. [barking] [Superman] Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Are you my super doggo? Are you? Oh! In the tongue. [laughs] Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? I miss my parents. [Superman] Who threw that kryptonite back into space? [suspenseful music playing] Hello, gorgeous. Oh, how I've longed for you to enter my solar system. [groaning] [continues groaning] You win this round, lettuce. [kryptonite pulsing] Guys, what's going on? Nothing, PB. Just the plan that you all called crazy turns out to be crazy good. [evil chuckle] You see, when I was back in the lab, there was this human. He was evil, sadistic, hot. [chuckles] And together we were two scientists searching for ultimate power. Of course, there were missteps along the way. The red kryptonite made my hair fall out. Luckily, I had the bone structure to pull it off. Purple gave me uncomfortably vivid dreams. But the orange... we knew the orange would be different. And we had a plan. Until Krypto the Superdog had to come and ruin it. [alarm blaring] Stupid name. Named after his planet. Oh, real creative. [guinea pig 1] Thanks, Krypto! [guinea pig 2] I'm coming home, son! Huh? What the heck are you doing? I'm freeing you from this horrible animal testing lab. -[explosion] -No! This is my home! And now this is your new home. -You're welcome. -What are you talking about? -[grunts, groans] -Oh, you're the sweetest! Unhand me, wench! [ominous music playing] So I bided my time in this disturbing hovel, preparing. Because I'd figured out something that even Lex couldn't. Orange kryptonite doesn't work on people. It only works on pets. [ominous music swells] [ominous music resumes] Uh, Lulu, are you okay? Oh, I'm more than okay, pig. I am what I was always meant to become. Lulu, hey. What? Take us with you, okay? Us shelter animals, you know, we... we gotta stick together, right? Solidarity. Oh, Ace, I'm sorry. I don't really have time in my life right now to take care of a pet! [sinister music playing] Lulu, wait! Do not leave us here! Don't worry, I'm sure someone wonderful will adopt you any day. [animal] What about me? Oh, Whiskers. Of course. I'm not a monster. -[laughs] -[meowing] Miss you. Love you. Have fun. [screams] Hold on, PB. I'mma get us out. -[grunts] -[grunts] I smell bacon! Why is my mouth watering? There's so much to unpack here. [screams] [gasps] Guys, I'm small! What just happened? No, seriously, what just happened? I can't see [bleep]. The orange kryptonite gave me powers, too. [gasps] This is my origin story. And my uncle didn't even have to die. Uh, yeah, that's great. But it ain't lookin' too good for your old pal Ace. [gasps] Right. Wonder Pig, still working on the name, is on it. [grunts] [groaning] -[cracking] -uh-oh. -[screams] Ace, no! -[Chip] Ace! [dramatic music playing] [both gasp] I should be a lot more dead right now, right? [PB] Oh, my gosh. The orange kryptonite gave you powers, too! You're super strong! And your tail is now made of fire. I'm sorry. My what is who? [screams] -My tail! Ah, let go of my... -[floor squeaking] Oh, my tail... My tail on fire! I got my tail on fire! Ace, it's fine. See? Huh? You're invulnerable. And I can shrink myself down to the size of an... [screams, grunts] [jazz music playing on radio] Ah! [chuckles sheepishly] Still working out the kinks. I didn't see anything. You go get Chip, I'll get Mert. [dramatic music playing] [Merton grunts] [dinging] [screeches] In your face, lettuce. -[cracking] -[gasping] [sighs in exasperation] [smooth jazz music playing on radio] [PB grunts] Oh, great. I'm the only one who didn't get any super... [screaming] [chuckles nervously] [radio presenter] Metropolis 97.2... -[gasps] -...smooth jazz. -Come on, let's get outta here. -Right. [crashing] Update. I'm fast now, but I still can't see [bleep]. -[crashing] -[car alarm blaring] -[Merton] Uh-uh. Here we go. -[cat yowls] [upbeat music playing on speakers] -[microwave beeps, whirrs] -[popcorn popping] All right. Thursday night TV night. Time for my favorite show with my bro in Metropo. Huh? ♪ I am Superman ♪ ♪ And I can do any... ♪ Huh? What the...? Let me just iron that out. They should call me Iron Man. [laughs] No. Well, look at you, all spiffy.

[sniffs] On Bake Off night? -[door buzzing] -[mischievous music playing] Aw! Hey there, little fella. -[gasps] -[growls] [seagull squawking] [Lois screaming] -[mischievous music playing] -Nah.

No. Must protect Super... [grunts] [garbage clattering] [siren blaring] [groaning] Superman! -I have to find... -[bones cracking] [groaning] [sighs softly] -[collar chiming] -Huh? [Krypto gasps] Father. Yes, it is I, Dog-El. When you were just a puppy, I recorded all my knowledge in your collar. I know. You've always helped me in the past, and I could really use you now. Yes, it is I, Dog-El. We really need a skip-intro button. Talk to me, my son. What seems to be the problem? Superman. He's been captured. [Dog-El] Hmm. I'm sorry. I know how close you are. Yeah, I mean, we were. Well, you just can't sit there feeling sad. You have to go rescue him. You're right. I'll save Superman, and when I do, he'll realize that I'm the only friend he ever needs. Uh... That's not exactly what I-- But how am I supposed to be a hero when I don't have my powers? It's not superpowers that make you a hero, Krypto. That's not your problem. Then what is it? Your problem is you. You... [echoes] Me? What do you mean, me? Father? -[dramatic music playing] -[electricity crackling] A-ha! That must be the vile rodent. Don't worry, Superman, I won't rest until I rescue you. [yawns] This is very restful. -Yes. -[crackling] [screams] [chuckles sheepishly] Whoops. [Ace] We're gonna have to work on that. I never knew the stars could be this beautiful, and there's so many of them. Look, there's one. Oh, there's another one. [chuckles] Look, there's one, too. Eh! These stars are crap. Wait till we get to the farm. Yeah. [sighs] Everything's better at the farm. Oh! Oh, yeah. Um, yeah, about... about the farm. See, understand this. There's always a literal interpretation and then... and then a more... [Krypto panting] Where is she? Where...? Where...? [breathes deeply] Okay. Where... Where is she? [panting] -[panting] Okay. Where is she? -[dramatic music swells] -[all gasp] -[Chip] Ugh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've, uh, I've never really run before. [panting] [weakly] I... I usually "Pup, up, and away." Are you okay? [in normal voice] I'm fine, I'm fine. I was just, uh, hit by a car a little. [sighs] You never forget your first time. Wait a minute, where do I know you from? I can't put my paw on it. -Where is she? -[gasps, yelps] [dramatic music swells] Whoa. So, the powers I saw were yours? You hooligans can help me. Hurry, there isn't much time. We have to save Superman. Superman? [heroic music playing] Oh, of course! You're that super dork who got me thrown back in the slammer. What was it? Creepo? Crisco? What's your name? No. It's Krypto the Superdog! [Ace] Oh! Well, it looks like we're both super now. You know, I still owe you a whuppin'. -Hi-yah! -Ow! That was my good eye. Now, wait. It was supposed to be a fair fight. Why didn't you block me with some freeze heat that was coming out your ears or something? Because, I... [sighs] I... [mumbling] I don't have my powers. -What? -[amusing music playing] I said I don't have my powers anymore. [laughing] Did ya...? You don't have your powers? Yeah, that's what's going on. You're just trying to use us now, because you can't handle it on your own. Look, I know these powers are new to you, but when one has an abundance of power... [groans] ...they have a certain duty to use that power to... -[Ace urinating] -[heroic music stops] Sorry. You were sayin' somethin'? I was making an inspiring hero speech. [Ace continues urinating] How much did you have to drink? I had two toilet bowls and a bidet. A bidet, too, which is, which is crazy. I didn't even know that was a thing. But it's like a dog water fountain. You disgusting animal. Pack, let's roll out. I'll see you never, Narc Kent. No! My best friend is in danger, and you have to help me. [Ace] Sorry, we got other plans. Good luck with your danger. We're going to the farm. Oh, yeah! Lettuce trees, baby! "Lettuce trees"? What's this farm called? The farm upstate. That sounds made-up. Oh, yeah? Well, how would you know? I grew up on a farm. In a town called Smallville. Now that sounds made-up. So, which way is this so-called farm? Well, it's upstate. So, that... that means it's... it's up, obviously. Okay. He's not telling you the-- [Ace] Can I steal you for a sec? You lied about the farm, didn't you? Big time. Look, I had to give them some hope. -There's one there. -[Ace] No one was ever gonna adopt us. There's one, too. So, I promised them it would be their new home. You know, I'd be happy to take you and your friends to my farm. If you help me save Superman. Wait a minute. Is this blackmail? Are you blackmailing me? No. I'm just asking you for something, which I will reward you for by not revealing damaging information. That is literally the definition of blackmail. Fine. We'll help you get your dumb owner back. You got yourself a super team. [heroic music swells, stops] Did someone just say super team? [Chip muffled] Yay. My destiny awaits. -[sinister music playing] -[Lulu] Terrifying villains, deadly assassins, I have come to recruit you for a siege of murderous savagery! [all munching] My fellow, furrier, guinea pigs. I have sought you out because you are apex predators. Gods amongst men! [all munching] Okay, look. Pig to pig, I need your help because my owner has gotten himself into a bit of a pickle. [reporter] Thwarted by the Justice League, Lex Luthor now finds himself behind bars. I'll destroy you all! That's my best friend. [chuckles] And mentor. Best friend and mentor. [clears throat] [reporter] Built to house fearsome superpowered criminals, Stryker's Island is the world's most inescapable prison. Which is where you dorks come in. You see, if I'm gonna get Lex outta that dump, I'm gonna need an army. [cages rattling] [guinea pigs squeaking] Um, actually, I think we'd just rather stay here. Yeah, I mean, we get summers off, all-you-can-drink water. [slurping] We even have Spanish class every miercoles. Oh, you have nothing... until you've licked from the cold steel straw of power. [kryptonite pulsing] -[tires screeching] -[engine revving] [dramatic music playing] Not so fast. Lois Lane told us all about you, hamster. Hamster? A hamster is a... is a hacky sack! A hamster is a mouse that had too much for lunch! We are guinea pigs and when we're through with you, buster, you'll know it. Hmm. [dramatic music intensifies] [screeches] [guinea pig growls] What's going on? That was your cue to attack. Uh... Oh, sorry. I... I was waiting for him to go first. Yeah, but if I went first, your fire would melt my ice, so maybe the... the wing lady should go first? I have a name. But then I'd set her wings on fire, and I don't think any of us want that. Well, you don't want ice on wings. -[guinea pig 1] Why? -[guinea pig 2] They... It clogs the feathers. Just get him! [dramatic music playing] [Batman grunts] [roars] [Batman groans] -[body thuds] -[guinea pigs squealing] Whoo! That was fun. Now then, let's go free Lex. Huh? [screams] [tires screeching] This ends now, sister. I have you in my Lasso of Truth. Oh, you want the truth? The boots are a bit much. [yells] [siren blaring] -[hip-hop music playing] -[sniffing] Is this really the best way to find Superman? Because to me, this just seems gross. What do you mean, gross? Smelling stuff is one of the greatest joys of being a dog. Next to licking any part of your body. I mean, I lick myself all the time. Well, that explains the breath. You wanna find Lulu and rescue Captain Hair Gel, right? Well, I suggest you start sniffing. You know what they say, smell is the sight of the nose. No one says that. Well, they should. Check it. [sniffs] Uh-huh. A poodle drooled right here. [sniffs] Someone threw a perfectly good pizza crust in that dumpster right there. [sniffs] And on that corner... [sniffs] That corner right there... Oh, no. Dang. A pigeon got her heart broken. I can still smell the hurt. [sniffs] She was a heavy crier. It's a superpower that every dog possesses. Even a wack one like you. -[scoffs] I'm not wack. -[sniffs] [sniffs] Oh! [dry heaving] [Ace] Ooh, is that a band-aid? [gags, groans] -[dog panting] -[bell tolling] -[sighs] -[sentimental music playing] -It's walk-o'clock. -What-oh-what? -Nothing. -Okay. Because it sounded like a super adorable nickname you got for your walks with your owner. All right, maybe this is when me and Supes used to hang out. Every morning, since I was a puppy. Aw! Well, you might not have your Superman, but at least you have us. -A whole super team! -[heroic music playing] The Mighty Oink! Squirrelverine. Droolo. Seriously? Droolo? And wait, where's Shell-on-wheels? Shell? [Merton laughing] What's happenin', sweet cheeks? [romantic music playing] Ah, I get it. The strong, silent type. Who needs words? Man, I wish I still had my powers. Yeah, what happened to them anyway? I ate some green kryptonite. A Kryptonian's only weakness. Why would you eat your weakness, you dum-dum? It was in some cheese. A dog's only weakness. Well, I ate a toy dinosaur once. If we're goin' off that, I'd say you probably got a solid two days until that thing passes. Unless it's a stegosaurus, and then you just pray. -[people screaming on tv] -You guys, look! [foreboding music playing] M'kay, Wonder Woman will stop her. [gasps] Goddess, no! Um... That sounded like a bone breaking. Is that even how it works? I guess it's down to us. Who's ready to go save my best friend? You want us to fight her? [shudders] She just took out the whole Justice League! And they all have opposable thumbs. [sighs] Remember me when I'm gone, Fabrizio. Guys, relax. We'll be fine. [screaming] -[car horn honking] -[tires screeching] [sinister music playing] [man] Why are they so mad? [people screaming] [roars] You see? Totally fine. -Now, let's hero up. -[heroic music playing] All right, team, what are your stats? Like, my powers include heat vision, freeze breath... And don't forget the Solar Paw Punch. What is that? Is that like a juice box flavor or something? No, it's Krypto's most powerful move. It requires him to fly directly to the sun and absorb its deadly radiation, turning himself into a dog-shaped thermal energy event. Not even Superman himself has tried it. Because he doesn't have paws? Because it's not something you come back from. The punch causes a blast which takes out not only the villain who gets hit with the blow, but the hero who throws it. Sounds like a terrible power. Does sound like a good juice box, though. I would drink the juice box. Okay, enough mayhem. Thank you. We gotta go... My goodness! [laughs] Look who's alive! Well, let's correct that little oversight, shall we? [whistles menacingly] [guinea pigs snarling] Ace, deploy canine shield. What is a canine...? [screams] [all screaming] Evade! Excellent shielding. That seemed incredibly painful. [Ace groans] Anybody wanna switch powers? You're up, pig. Okay, PB, think big! [grunts] [gasps] -[people panicking] -[screaming] [gasps, screaming] Squirrel, light 'em up. [crackling] [guinea pigs snarling] No, no, no. I can't. Of course you can. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? I could hurt someone. Or they could hurt me. Or maybe me freezing like this is the worst thing. [screams] Turtle, use your speed and get them-- On it. [heroic music playing] [heroic music stops] Where the [bleep] am I? [munching] [sighs] You guys are terrible superheroes. [scoffs] I don't understand why you're not getting this. Yeah, well, there's a lot that you don't understand about us, you fool. Maybe if you paid attention to... Huh? -Oh, I'm paying attention. -[groans] Help. One-hundo percent attention. So thick and swole, his abs. [yelps] -His abs. -[growling] [dramatic music playing] [guinea pig screeches] Risky move for a dog with no powers. -Some would say heroic. -[straining] I would say dumb. Where is Superman? [in sing-song voice] I'm not telling. [chuckles] [normal voice] Classic evil. Lex would be so proud. This is really about Lex Luthor? Don't you understand? He was testing on you. We were colleagues. We were scientists together. You were the guinea pig. Your hair fell out. [gulps] Yeah. Just like his did. Lex needed me. That's more than I can say for your Superman. Superman needed me. He... he needs me. Does he? Because I'm pretty sure he's gonna get everything he needs from his... fiancee. [Krypto gasps] Oh, no. You didn't know they were getting married. I really am sorry, 'cause this must be so painful to have to hear this from me. No. You're lying. Am I? Huh. Well, then why did this little bauble fall out of his Underoos the night I took him down? Look at it. The cut's fine but the clarity is murky as heck. [gags] Face it, Wonder Mutt, you're too late. Your boy's getting hitched. And that means... Bye-bye, dog. But don't worry, if Superman doesn't have room in his life for you anymore, I'm sure you can, uh, crash at the Hall of Justice. [screaming] [groans] [screaming] [groans, whimpering] Wow! She threw that dog real far. You know what's funny? For a minute, I was worried when I saw that the orange kryptonite gave you powers, but then I remembered, uh, you're you. [laughing] Come on, let's go, little piggies. What did I tell you? Isn't this better than Spanish class? -[guinea pigs] Si. -[guinea pig speaking Spanish] [Lex] Hey, Lois Lane. Always nice to see ya. Talk, Lex. I know you're behind this. Impressive destruction, but not my work. Your name is literally on the monster. Looks like one of my little babies is all grown up. That's creepy. Spill it, Lex. What have you done with Superman? Wherever Superman is, it's got nothing to do with me, or my company, LexCorp International. [ominous music playing] [justice league grunting] [Superman grunting] [Batman] Hey! Stop chewing on that Batarang. Bruce Wayne paid a lot of money for that, and then gave it to me as a present. Vic, can you override their defenses? [sighs] I can't do anything while they got me stuck in airplane mode. All those protocols for an alien invasion, nothing for little furballs. These quadrupedal land maniacs have made a giant mistake messing with the King of... Oh, whoa! Hey, hold on. Is that fish food? [chomping] Aw, someone was hungy. Lex Luthor denies involvement, but is quote "team bad guy." Luckily, Superman's dog is on our team. Krypto? Of course, Superman's dog he makes out with. He'll save us. [Superman] No. He doesn't have his powers. But those other animals do. And... and like, can't Krypto work with them to... to save Metropolis? Yeah, about that. He's not the greatest with other animals. He better get it together soon, or those ferrets are gonna take over the world. [Chip muffled] Is he okay? [groans] [PB] Looks like he's still breathing. Yep. He's alive. Pay up, dog. [chomping] You bet on if I was alive? Nope. I bet on if you were dead. I bet you were horribly maimed. -[scoffs] What a fun game. -Hey! So, what, uh, what is this place anyway? Is this some type of fancy DMV? Are you kidding? It's the Hall of Justice. This is where the Justice League hangs out. I bet they're all super tight buds, and they, like, try on each other's clothes and then they eat, like, really fun snacks, and then they probably just tell each other everything. Yeah. Everything. [melancholic music playing] [sighs] He seems sad and defeated. So, it is a DMV. [sighs] Maybe one of us should go talk to him. Not it. Ace, you always know what to say. [melancholic music continues] -Watch out for the... -[metallic thud] -[Ace groans] -...invisible jet. I just want to be alone. This is the best place to watch the sunset. You wanna be alone, why don't you go someplace uglier? Besides, don't you wanna save your Superman? Of course I do. He's my best friend. At least I thought he was. Things are changing so fast, he didn't even tell me he was getting married. That's what's got your leash all twisted, huh? [Ace sighs] Yeah, well, people are complicated. How would you know? Nah, forget it. [sentimental music playing] [gasps] You had an owner. Right. That's your business. I am not gonna pry. Was he nice? [groans] They. My owner was a family. ♪ We all come from somewhere♪ ♪ Even when you know where ♪ [Ace] A mom, a dad, and her.

Worst day of my life, but I wouldn't change a thing about it. Why not? Well, when you love somebody, and I mean, you really love them, you gotta be willing to do anything for 'em. Even if that means letting them go. Even if it hurts? [Ace chuckles] Especially then. You know what they say about dogs, don't you? Never feed us chocolate. We love unconditionally. -[whimsical music playing] -[crackling] [both grunting] -[Merton] Excuse me, sir. -[Chip screams] [Chip groans] I am really bad at this. That's just because you're still learning your powers. Every hero struggles like this. Until they have their training montage. ['80s rock music playing] [chews loudly] [squeaks] [knuckles cracking] [grunting] [yells] -[crackling] -[Chip screams] [music stops] -[Chip continues screaming] -[gasps] [grunts, screams] -[Chip screams] -[glass shatters] [chuckles] They're gonna need a longer montage. Those guys, well, they suck visibly. Yes, I... I can agree with you there, but they're stronger than you think. [grunts] [Ace] PB just needs to love herself as much as she loves everyone else. [screams] [Ace] Chip needs to feel safe. -[Chip exclaims] -And Merton... Merton needs leafy greens. You really know them, huh? It's called listenin'. You learn a lot about someone when you're locked up with them forever. Wait a minute. Lulu was in the shelter with you, too. What did you learn about her? All that guinea pig ever talked about was world domination and some bald dude with nice hands. -Lex. -[ominous music playing] Of course. Stryker's Island. She must be going there to spring him. Not if we get there first. Come on! -Watch out for the... -[metallic thud] [Ace groans] Invisible jet. Yep. [groans] Maybe put up a sign. Or rope it off. Maybe some cones. -[alarm blaring] -[dramatic music playing] [robot guard] Intruders. Intruders. Adorable intruders. They are so cute. No. That's my robot brother. [Lulu] This is it. Finally, the two great minds of our generation, back together. [chuckles] Your pet is coming for you, Lexi. [guinea pigs cheering] Oh, no! Oh, gosh! Cheese and crackers! -[rock music playing] -[engine starting] Oh, my gosh. Wonder Woman has sat, like, right where I'm sitting. Actually, I feel like I am her because I'm just, like, in her stance, I'm in her seat. And there's a peanut wedged in the crack of the seat. And now I'm eating her peanut. More importantly, can a dog fly a plane? Of course. I can fly. This can fly. It'll be just like riding a bike. Do you know how to ride a bike? No, I know how to fly. [groans] Relax, we'll be fine. [alarm beeping] Stop saying that! We're never fine! [all screaming] [all continue screaming] [suspenseful music playing] -[Ace groans] -[PB] Who shot us down? Wonder Woman's invisible jet is invisible. It's really more transparent. [meows] [purring] Whiskers? Out of the way, cat child. We have to get to Stryker's. Sorry, I can't do that. Lulu saved my life. Now, I must take yours. Goodbye. [dramatic music playing] -[Krypto yelps] -[PB screams] [humming] ♪ La-di-da-di-da ♪ [all screaming] [Whiskers laughing menacingly] In here. Okay. Everybody stay quiet. -[explosion] -Uh-oh. -What "oh"? -I'm gonna... No, never mind. No, wait, never mind. Never mind, never mind. [horn honks] -[romantic music playing] -What's happening, handsome? Come on, we're both grown-ups. Don't leave me hanging, okay? [laughs, gasps] [whiskers laughing menacingly] [muffled] Ay, she's going to see us. [grunts] [breathes heavily] PB, I'm gonna need you to get a little smaller. I know, I just can't control it. [sighs] Even with powers, I'm nothing like Wonder Woman. [Whiskers in sing-song voice] One, two, kitty's coming for you. PB, there's something you should know about Wonder Woman. Praise be her name. Diana is fiercely independent, completely her own woman. And if you really wanna be like her, you'll be yourself. [grunts] -[Merton exhales] -[PB gasps] [Whiskers laughing menacingly] I'm gonna rip you limb from limb. Okay, Chip, time to light that kitty up. But what if the demonic laser gato devours me? Or all of us? Or she only spares me, and I forever carry the guilt of survival? Chip, we all go to dark places. I thought about throwing Lois Lane in the ocean. But you can't spend the rest of your life stuck in your own head. You're right. It is really scary in here. Okay. You can do this, Chip. Get out of your head! [heroic music playing] [laughs] -[Krypto grunts] -[Chip yelps] All right, let's get to the bottom of Merton. It all started in Central City, 1854. [dramatic music playing] I'm just a sweet little purr-purr baby. Why won't you play with me? And I had a whole period in the '60s where I was basically a full-time alchemist. [groans] Merton, we don't have time. Here. Try these. [uplifting music playing] [Merton] Whoa! None of you are turtles! -This explains so much! -[uplifting music fades] -[Chip gasps] -[Whiskers] Super-Pets, come out to play. [sighs] That monster is lucky I don't have my heat vision. Good thing you've got something better. What's that? Us, you idiot. Okay, pack. I have a plan. [dramatic music playing] [meows] [coughing] [grenade pin clinks] See you in heck.

[smacking lips] Meow, meow, buh-bye. [music stops] [dramatic music playing] [grunts] Uh-oh. [grunts] [explosion] [Whiskers] I still have eight more lives. [heroic music playing] Come on. [Krypto] How fun was that? [Ace] A missile was shot into my chest! [Krypto] Uh, that's one way to put it. [Ace] There's no other way to put it. A missile was just shot into my chest. The threat was neutered, thanks to Krypto and friends. This is amazing! -Yes! Humanity is saved. -No! My baby made friends. If you all had pets, you'd understand. You know, I had a cheetah once, but she ate my landlord. And tore up my couch. Man, I loved that couch. On the planet Oa, I thought I had a pet raccoon, but he thought we were dating. All the creatures of the sea are my friends. Except for that one eel who knows what he did. Yeah, I'm not really an animal guy. Oh! Are you allergic or...? As a child, I fell into a well filled with bats. I can still hear the screams as their dark wings flapped around me, scratching my chubby, childish flesh. I'm tormented every waking moment. I really think a pet would be good for you. [dramatic music playing] [both sniffing] [gasps] I got Lulu's scent. [sniffs] She's this way. [scoffs] Well, look at you being a dog. Also, the prisoners had egg salad for lunch... and down that hall... [sniffs] Oh, dang, [sniffs] I think a robot guard got his heart broken. Dolores. [melancholic music playing] I'll admit, sometimes it can be a little too specific. [rumbling] [ominous music playing] -Lex! I'm here! -[sentimental music playing] -We're finally reunited. -Halt. Ah. The student returns to the teacher. Oh, good. Your marmot baby. Shove it. I'm his favorite henchman, not you, you piece of... [Lulu squeaking] [clears throat] Now, I have a present for you. Um, it's not here, but I have pictures of it. Loser, loser. Look at all their dumb outfits. Huh. My evil plan to take out the Justice League. [chuckles] Wow! You really did study. Ooh! And wait until you see this. Okay, I don't know how that got in there. No one wants that, right? [chuckles] Well, clearly, I've been hacked. Okay, let's get you out of here. Oh, I can't believe this is finally happening. I can't believe this is actually happening. [dramatic music playing] [yelling] [electricity crackling] [heroic music playing] This ends now, rodent. You were just defeated by... Let me remember it. The League of Super-Pets. Brring, brring. Hello, who's there? Uh, the League of Super-Pets. Give it up, Lulu. It's over. You idiots. You're actually getting the hang of this. I'm toast. I'm a goner. Not. [sinister music swells] [Ace] No! [Lulu] One more step and the puppy gets it. Unless your friends walk into those cells over there. Ace, attack. I'll be fine. [chuckling] You'll be a pancake. Okay, I'm gonna count to three and I'll start at two 'cause I'm evil. Two... All right, Lulu. You win. No! Don't listen to her. What choice do we have? [Lulu] Oh, I didn't know they were gonna be so sad. He doesn't wanna go in the cage, but he has to, to save the other one. Everyone is upset. [chuckles] ♪ The dogs are sad ♪ ♪ The turtle's sad ♪ ♪ And the squirrel is sad ♪ -[PB grunting] -[dramatic music playing] Okay. Now then, where was I? Let me look at you, my pet.

Little turn of events! ♪ The guinea pig is sad ♪ [grunts] [sighs] [breathing heavily] Lulu, I know you're hurting, but join our pack. Hold up, wait! For real? She left us to die in a fire, remember? Yeah, but if we work together, we can get outta here and save Superman. Huh. You truly love him. Of course I do. You're a fool. He'll only break your heart. Luckily, I'm going to do you a favor, and destroy him before he gets the chance. What are you talking about? Oh, did I forget to mention my evil plan's grand finale? In 28 minutes, the entire Justice League is gonna go kaboom. If I can't have my guy, then you can't have yours. No. I won't let you hurt him. Just one question, how are you gonna stop me when you're trapped in a cage? You're trapped, too, genius. Yes, I know. But just like at the shelter, I always have an exit strategy. Hey, girl. Dish, queen. How'd it go with Lex? [growls] Okay, I feel like I can say this now, I never liked him. Lex will pay for what he's done. Right alongside the Justice League. [ominous music playing] You won't get away with this. I say this with love. You are all losers. You've always been losers, and you'll continue to be losers until the end of your loser lives. Oh, and Krypto, I'll be sure to say goodbye to Superman for you. -[timer beeping] -[ominous music fades] Well, well, well. If it isn't the Justice League, captured by me, entirely on my own. The guinea pig did literally everything. [Lex] Yes, gotta admit, doesn't feel great. But it's all worth it. Because you chumps are going down for good. [ominous music playing] [Super-Pets grunting] [somber music playing] [Krypto] It's no use. These cells were designed to keep anyone with powers from escaping. You'd have to be as strong as Superman to get out. Well, we can't just give up. There's a difference between giving up and knowing when it's over. Mm-mmm. No way. Not for superheroes. I'm not a superhero. I'm not even a good dog. When I was a puppy, I promised I'd watch over Superman. And I failed. All because I was jealous of Lois. Who wouldn't be? Have you seen those bangs? Ba-bang! Superman was my only friend and I was afraid to lose that. But you can't blame yourself. I'm the only one to blame. If I really was his friend, I'd have been there for him no matter what. My father was right. My problem is me. [sniffles] I'm sorry. Nah, man, you're good. You're just finally being real with yourself. You can't have justice without truth. Thanks, Ace. But it's too late. Are you sure about that, perrito? -What do you mean? -[dramatic music playing] You're flying. What? I'm... My powers. I'm back! The kryptonite has left the dog. [sniffing] Well, that does smell like sandalwood. [grunts] All right, time to save the Justice League. -[Chip speaking Spanish] -Let's crack some skulls. No, you've done enough. Um, say what now? I started this with one best friend to save and now I have four more. Aw! He means us. I can't let you keep risking your lives for my mistake. But don't worry, when this is over, I'm still taking you all to that farm. Pup, up and away! You believe that dog? Has an emotional breakthrough, gets his powers back, and then bounces. -I thought it was sweet. -Me, too. I'm medium on it, you know, if I'm honest. [sinister music playing] [metal creaking] [people screaming] Time for the death of Superman. [Krypto] I'm not so sure about that. [up-tempo electronic music playing] Ugh! This guy again? [growls] [growls] [squeals] [screams] [groans] -[groans] -[music stops] [sighs] [chuckles nervously] -[squeaking] -[sinister music playing] Any last words? -[groans] I love saying that. -[rumbling] Any last words? Ooh, it is fun. [chuckling] Hey. You liked my little joke? Lockin' you up in the cell. [laughs] That was funny, right? Right? No, hey, come on, it's me. Papa Lex. No, hey... What? Come on! [laughing menacingly] Yeah, I don't get paid enough for this, no. [elevator dings] Lock the gates. [machine beeping] Ew, I can't wait that long. Let's do it now. I want to do it now. [Mark] Are you sure about this? I mean, the kidnapping we could get behind. We liked the kidnapping, but if you do this, they'll die. That's the point of... What did you think we were doing? Mark, Keith, suffer. [both screaming] [Krypto] Stand down. [dramatic music playing] Okay, Krypto, you are definitely stalking me now. I'm, like, creeped out. -[gasps] -Bye. [Krypto grunts] [gasps] Fly over there. You mean, toward the murder rodent? Where is Superman? You're too late. I'm sending him back to the place from whence he came from. Boop! [alarm blaring] [building rumbling] [laughing maniacally] No! [Lulu continues laughing] [building crashing, rumbling] What... What's going on? [Lex] Uh, yeah, funny story. I, uh, turned my office into a rocket ship. All billionaires have 'em. It's true. [Mark coughing] Krypto, there's a bomb on the rocket. When it leaves Earth's atmosphere, it'll implode. [Keith and Mark coughing] We're just coughing. Go! I'm coming for you, Superman. Uh-uh-uh! Not so fast. [pilot yelps] -[screaming] -[gasps] [Lulu] Who gets to live, doggy? The man you love, or the woman he does? You can't save them both on your own. [distant boom] What's up, dog? Ugh, what is this? PAW Patrol? [chuckles] I thought I told you guys to stay put. When do we ever listen to you? Boo! I'm bored! -Let's get to the fiery crash. -[snaps fingers] [pilot and Lois screaming] You save Superman. -From a rocket? -I trust you. Okay, but from a rocket, though? Hop on, y'all. Because this pig right here [in deep voice] is about to go ham. [people gasping] [both screaming] [tense music playing] [both gasping] [screaming] [helicopter thuds] [heroic music playing] [growls] That thing took our Superman. She's goin' down. [PB grunting] [in deep voice] Merton, hit it. [Chip screaming] [Chip] Ay! It's over, hamster. Hamster? A hamster is just a dollar store gerbil. A hamster is a chipmunk with nothing interesting going on fur-wise. [Krypto groans] [growls] You're up, kid. Open it like a can of tuna. [grunting] [screams] -Well, I loosened it for you. -[chuckles sheepishly] [sighs] Man, I hate bein' invulnerable. Here we go. This is gonna hurt tomorrow. Why couldn't I have been stretchy? Or, like, gotten a magic hammer or something. [groaning, yells] [machine beeping loudly] [tense music playing] -[metal rattling] -[groaning] [machine beeping rapidly] [explosion] No! [groaning] Face it. -It's over. -Huh? [groans] Your Superman is no more and now his precious little dog is about to... -What? What is it? -[tense music stops] Do I have something on my face? Do I have a pimple? Is it wet? Is it ready? Should I pop it? [gasps] [dramatic music playing] [PB grunts] [PB groaning] [Ace groans] Hey, guys. Big fan. Um... You all see the giant pig too, right? No. How did they...? You forgot one thing, Lulu. Unlike you, I have friends.

But not for long. -[rumbling] -[ominous music playing] [building rumbling] [birds screeching] [tires screeching] [people screaming] [people gasping] [ominous music continues] [distorted voice] Kneel before Lulu.

And why was your syntax so oddly structured in that sentence? [sighs] Keep an eye on Supes for me. Where's he going? No. Not the Solar Paw Punch. The juice box thing? But that'll kill him. Krypto, no. [dramatic music playing] You were right, Ace. Whoa, whoa! [Lulu] I am a few guineas short of a pig. -[Lulu laughs] -[PB] Uh... [heroic music playing] [Lulu laughs] [Green Lantern] Ah! [Aquaman grunts] [screams] [groaning] [roars] [Ace] Well, when you love somebody, and I mean, you really love them, you gotta be willing to do anything for 'em. [Krypto] Even if it hurts? [Ace chuckles] Especially then. [dramatic music swells] [groans] [all screaming] [distant explosion] [heroic music playing] -[Krypto grunts] -[explosion] [yells] No! [dramatic music playing] [groaning loudly] [dramatic music fades] [solemn music playing] -[coughs] -[gentle music playing] [Ace groans] Man, it sucks being a canine shield. -[bones cracking] -[Ace groans] Oof. [clicks tongue] I think my teeth are still glowing. You saved my life, man. Hey, well, you were in the middle of saving ours. You know what they say about dogs. [chuckles] So, something did get through that super skull of yours. Don't make me take it back. -[Keith] Bum, bum, bum. -[Mark] Bye. [water splashes] What? What have you done to me? I'm in hot dog water, aren't I? -[both laughing] -[Lulu] No! -[both laughing] -Yeah! [triumphant music playing] [panting] [Lois] Oh, thank goodness you're okay. [whines] I'm happy for you, buddy. You know Krypto rescued me? I know the feeling. He rescued me a long time ago. He's a good dog. [barks] [chuckles] Come here, boy. [barks] [grunts, laughs] Hey. [chuckles] [Krypto panting] I'm sorry, Krypto. You know you'll always be my best friend. And nothing can ever change that. [Krypto whines] Oh, one more thing. [Superman chuckles] -[gentle music playing] -Wow, look at that. I did have this whole thing planned, but-- Oh, no, please, this is exactly how I always pictured it. Giant evil guinea pig. This... This was on my vision board. Really. You wanna keep going? Yes, I would. Thank you. Lois Joanne Lane, make me the happiest Superman in the universe. -Will you-- -Yeah, okay! [coughs] Prenup. [clears throat] [barks] [Superman exclaims] -[Lois giggles] -[Superman chuckles] [toy squeaking] Squeezy Bruce! That better be a licensed toy, or I will freak out. [Chip panting] [Green Lantern grunts] [yelps] Oh! Hey, don't worry. I got you. [sighs] Okay, what's happening? Wow, this is so weird. [squeals] So beautiful! High-fiving so slow when we're both really fast. Huh. Princess Diana of Themyscira, I humbly present myself, Super Hog, still brainstorming, to you. -[PB gasps] -You will be a mighty warrior. And cuddle buddy. Woe is me. -[mellow music playing] -No one cares about the water guy. This water guy does. Hey, my name's Keith. -[kisses] -Aw, little piggy kisses. [Cyborg] Hey, smokey. You're looking a little burnt out. Need a light? -[gentle music playing] -Oh, look at me! -[laughs] -Aw, come here. I'm Mark. And your name? [bird cawing] -[gentle music fades] -So, you are a dog. I am the Batman. Sorry, I'm not really great with animals. Yeah, I'm not really great with people. Probably because of my traumatic puppyhood. As a child, my family was taken from me. As a puppy, I was taken from my family. So, I've steeled myself. -[somber music playing] -My emotions, always in check. [both] No one ever getting past my impenetrable defenses. Ah, what the heck? -[soft music playing] -[laughing] Good boy. Okay, the Batman loves you, too. [collar chiming] Oh! Hey, Pops. Yes, it is I, Dog-El. -[sighs] -[fast-forwarding] Never eat chocolate. That dog in the mirror is you. Fireworks suck! Tell Gail I said hey! Looks like you worked everything out with Superman. Thanks to your advice, I made some new friends, too. And now I've gotta bring them to Smallville. I promised them that it would be their new... [Batman chuckles] -[Wonder Woman laughing] -[Green Lantern] Aw! -[Flash laughs] -...home. [uplifting music playing] [Lois laughs] [upbeat music playing] [train horn blaring] [screeches] Hey, Chip-tonite, -How's it going with Jessica? -We're getting pretty close as person and pet. She even put a ring on it. Nice costume game, PB. Thanks! It even has magnets. Um, how long is this gonna take? I got a hot date with two firemen's helmets. Spoiler alert, they're twins. [engine roaring] [barking] You're late. Sorry, me and the Dark Knight were playing a little bit of fetch. Have you met Chewperman? [toy squeaking] So disrespectful. -[toy squeaks] -Y'all started it. So, what's the mission? We can answer that. [Keith] Okay, our intel indicates a dog has been mutated. This could be dangerous. We have to stop him. Tighten your collars. We've got work to do. [growling] [deep voice] I ate the FedEx guy. Hey, I know that dog. He's giant and blue and about to crush us. Can't crush what we have. Say it back. Come on. -Come on. -Can't crush what we have.

I always knew this is how it would end for me. [beeping] [crackling] [ominous music playing] [ominous music stops] [Lulu] Oh. It's you. Hi. -[soft music playing] -Let's be honest. The two of us are the real brains behind this operation. Forget Lex. We should team up. So, what do you say? You wanna come live in a studio apartment? Like, with you? Like, pet-owner situation? Hmm, uh, let me think. Yes, yes! The answer is yes! So, just something to know about me. I'm passionate about world domination and my nails need to be trimmed twice a month. [soft music fades] [heroic music playing] [barking] [toy squeaking] Fetch! [toy squeaks] [electricity crackling] [thunder rumbling] [toy squeaking] That's my toy. Then, why is it in my mouth? [Superhero] Superman. Black Adam. Your owner's a hero, too? -[toy squeaks] -Antihero. It's basically exactly like a regular hero except way cooler. You make up your own rules, and then you break them. Also, you can ignore most moral and ethical conventions because no one can stop you. Yeah, that sounds a lot like a villain. Antihero. If he's anti a hero, then isn't he a villain? Admit he's an antihero or Black Adam will destroy you. Very villain thing to do. It's a fine line, not gonna lie. Well, whatever he is, I bet he can't fly to Pluto. Oh, yeah? Watch him. [Krypto] My toy. [dramatic music fades]
