Yeah... Where the hell are you? Your connection's absolutely terrible right now. Ah, I'm visiting my family in Spain. - Cute. - Yeah. Uh, when are you comin' back to London? Uh, I don't have a ticket yet, but, uh, soonish, I guess. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hm... Very soon. So, what's up? Uh, so, don't tell anyone, Christina Aguilera is working on a comeback. Okay. Because, you know, she got fat and all. And she's trying to shift towards this artsy aesthetic... Mm-hm. Can you please turn your video off? Oh, sorry. Is it really bad? So much better. So much better. - Cool. - Anyway, like I was saying, she's going for, like, a Solange Knowles sort of vibe, I guess. It's gonna take a lot of talent to get to that level. That and some compression garments. Let's be real. You're awful. - I get paid to be awful. - Yeah. But anyway, the reason I'm calling is because we're giving her the cover and we want you to style it. Oh! Okay. That's great. Thank you! That's great news! - Yeah. Wonderful, wonderful. - Love to do it. Yeah. So, tell me more about it. When... Sorry? Uh, what was that? No, my mom, um, dinner is ready. No problem. So, uh, when and where? Oh, in New York in, like, uh, two weeks. All right, sounds doable. Great. So, yeah, what's the budget? Well, we're still waiting to confirm some sponsors, but we'll definitely put you up for a night at the Face Hotel, on us. Ok-Okay. Is there... Is the flight included or anything? No, no, no. Definitely not an overseas flight. But, uh, you know, the bigger the name, the less money's involved. - Mm-hm. - It is a lot of exposure. Yeah, sure, no. It's great. Thank you. Um... I need to look at my schedule and my agenda and all that, and let you know if I have time to come to New York in the next two weeks and stuff, and... But I'd love to do it! So, I'll give you a...
