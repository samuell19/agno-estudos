[heartbeat] [door opens] [sobs] [water sloshing] [Peter] Growing up, my dad was my best friend. The two of us were inseparable. [fishing line rattling] [tranquil music] [camera shutter clicks] Keep this up, Peter, and one day it'll be worth something. [Peter]We never saw it coming. The brain tumor hit hard and fast. I never understood why God let that happen, but it changed my life forever. Many say, life's a journey not a destination, this is mine. [calm music] [radio DJ] Well, unless you've been living under a rock, which may have been foreclosed on by now, you know that the largest economy in the world is in a massive free fall. We're smack dab in the middle of the biggest market crash in generations. Folks, this is as close to the Great Depression as we want to get. Something like five percent of all homeowners are behind of their payments. And the ten percent unemployment rate pretty much guarantees that, that number's gonna go way up. So we've got some experts coming up... [car engine revs] [somber music] [keyboard clacking] Hey, sleepyhead. Get up. You're gonna be late for work. [Ellie] Hm, I called out. What's wrong? I'm not feeling well. It's probably just a stomach virus. You don't feel warm. [Peter] Can I get you anything? No, thanks. [sighs] I just need to sleep. Ellie, remember when I gave you that envelope to mail -for unemployment? -[Ellie] Mm-hm. [Peter] When did you mail it? I don't know. I think a few days after. All right. I'll be at the gym. Call me if you need anything. [sighs] -[thwacking] -[panting] [blows air] Okay, what's going on? [panting] Nothing. Nothing I can't handle. So, uh, how are things with you and, and Irinki? Irinka. [Matt] Nah, she barely spoke a lick of English. -Red flag. -Yeah. Unless you're at the mall, then she's fluent. -"Buy me this, buy me this." -[Peter] Oh, yeah, no. -"Bye-bye." -[Matt] It's crazy. She thinks I'm made of money. Honestly, I'm thinking about getting off the grid. Oh, man. So, how's work going? Any luck? Yeah, we just got a big remodeling job. We start next week. Nice. Hey, man, I'm free if you guys need an extra pair of hands. I'll put in a good word for you, buddy. You know it. That'd be great. -Wanna do this again? -[Peter] Yeah! [Peter blows air] -All right. I love pain. -[thwacks] [Peter] Let's do it. [thwacking] [Ellie retches] [breathing heavily] Hey. Hey, mister, excuse me. Could you spare a dollar? Sorry. God bless you. [calm music] All I'm asking from you is to bump up our credit limit to where it was. Yes, by one day. Ma'am, I read the guidelines, I know what they clearly state. [knocking on door] -Made some coffee. -I'll be right out. Yes, I'm still here. Look, I'd like to speak to your manager. You are? -[phone beeps] -[clatters] Everything okay? -Why wouldn't it be? -I don't know, I'm just asking. I was just on the phone with the credit card company. It's all good. [groans] No creamer? We ran out. [Ellie] We ran out of a lot of things. All right. I'm going to run out to the store. No. Can we just sit together for a bit? You know I can't drink coffee without cream. And besides, I need to pick us up a few things, right? [sighs] Yeah. Sure. [keys jangle] I'll be back. [smooches] [soft music] [rattling] [machine beeping] -Paper or plastic? -Uh, paper, please. Okay, that'll be 19.46. -Credit or debit? -Debit. Go ahead and swipe your card. -[rasps] -[device beeping] [bleeps] Oh, it was declined. Oh. That can't be. Uh, try it again. [cashier] Okay. -[beeps] -[cashier] Go ahead. [device beeping] [beeps] No. Sorry. Um... Can you put my stuff to the side? Uh, I have some money in the car. I'll be right back. Yeah. No problem. [ominous music] [light music] [horn blares] -[car alarm beeps] -[lock clicks] [sighs] [cell phone ringing] [ringing continues] [beeps] Hi, Mom. [Athena] Peter, I'm so glad you picked up. What's up? Is everything okay? [Athena] I haven't heard from you, and I had a very bad feeling. I'm fine. [Athena] Are you sure? You sound down. I'm just tired, that's all. [Athena]Well, I have some food for you, kids. When can you stop by? Uh, I can swing by now if you want. [whirring] I thought you retired. Don't be silly, this is from Mr. Alexander. Oh, I sure hope you're charging him. Are you kidding? He drives me everywhere. I'd be lost without him. Besides, he'd lent you his shoes for the play, remember? Mom, that was, like, 20 years ago. [sighs] How time flies. Peter, I'm so proud of you for sticking with it. You know that you can't quit. You know what happens if you quit. -I will kick your butt. -I will kick your butt. [both laugh] You know, if your father was here, I know that he would not want you to quit either. Funny you should bring dad up. I saw this man outside the store today. And for a second, he looked just like him. Hm. What? I went to the cemetery this morning. [Athena] Today is 25 years. If I didn't know better, I would say he is trying to tell you something. Come on, Mom. I said he looked like him. Mm-hm. Those are from the garden. You should see them. They're megalos. Huge. [cell phone chimes] Sorry, Mom. I gotta cut this short. I just picked up an audition. Oh, good, good. Never mind. Wait one moment. One moment. Here. [Athena] These are the turkey meatballs. This is spanakopita, with just a little feta for the camera. You're the best. Give Ellie my love, huh? And here, -take this and don't say no. -No. I'm fine. Good. I'm glad. Have a coffee. Buy some flowers. I don't care. [speaks Greek] -Go on. -[Peter in Greek] [in Greek] Thanks, Mom. [speaks Greek] I'm so glad you stopped by mom's. The meatballs are delicious. -You want some? -No. What's the audition for? Hello? TV show. Hey. Can we talk? -I'm studying. -It'll just take a minute. I-- Ellie, no. Not now, please. You don't have to jump down my throat. I'm sorry. I really need to book this. Okay? [somber music] [car alarm beeps] [keys jangle] [car engine sputtering] [sputtering continues] [beeping] [sighs] I will. Thanks, girl. Ellie, can you drop me off at my audition? My car won't start. Take mine. Aren't you going to work? [retches, coughs] [sobs] -Can I come in? -No. Just go. [Ellie coughs, sniffles] We'll catch up when I get back. I promise. [sighs] Uh, on second thought, I'll, I'll stand. [director] Okay. Uh, no need to slate your name. Whenever you're ready. Hi, Peter Ranos. [sighs nervously] "If you don't clean up your act, you're going to end up in jail. Is... Is that what you want?" Okay. That's good. Thank you. Uh... But there's two... two and a half pages left. [director] I got what I needed. Can I do it again? I... I know I can do it better. That was fine. I can do it with a Greek accent if you want. Do you speak Greek? [speaks Greek] -Okay. -[camera beeps] [keys clink] [paper rustling] [foreboding music] -[keys clatter] -[sighs] I thought I heard something. How'd the audition go? What's wrong? I found this in your car. I remember signing for it, but I had no idea. I don't understand. What's going on? We had an adjustable loan, and well... it adjusted. When? About four months ago. Why didn't you tell me? I thought I would land a big role and get us out of this. Are you serious? Don't you think that having a job would have been better? I didn't ask to get laid off, okay? It's been over a year, Peter. Obviously, collecting unemployment and trying to be an actor isn't working. I looked for three months straight and nothing. You turned down two offers, Peter. Working a lousy job for $7.25 an hour isn't my idea of a good life. [Ellie] Well, it's better than being homeless! We're not gonna be homeless. We have seven days, Peter. Where are we gonna get this money from? Where? [Ellie scoffs] [sobs] [somber music] [whimpers] [clinks, clatters] [tranquil music] [Peter] I got my car running. Looks like you're feeling better. I, um, spoke to mom and dad. [Ellie] His disability check is all they get. Okay. [Ellie] I was thinking. I'm off Sunday. Maybe we can have a garage sale. [Peter] Sure. We'll need to get a permit. Oh, yeah. It's Thursday, we need to jump right on it. I get it. Okay. [sighs] Are you gonna eat that? No. [indistinct chatter] I can't believe this is happening. It's not just you guys. I know, but every cent we had went into buying our home. [Matt] That's unbelievable. Which part? -Truly unbelievable. -Which part? The legs on that brunette. Wow. Come on, Matt. This is serious. I know, buddy. I'm just trying to lighten things up. [sighs] So what are you gonna do now? Get an extension. [Peter] Mr. Hershey, I know this is going to sound clich√©, but it's the truth. [Steven] Hm, excuse me just a second. [Sandra] Here's the Ranos file. -Thank you, Sandra. -[Sandra] You're welcome. Please, continue. Uh, my wife and I... We're in a bit of a dilemma. [Peter] We had misplaced the envelope regarding your last correspondence, and... we just found it. [Steven] Well, let's see. Got your file right here. [Steven] Oh. I see. "Notice of Default." Exactly. Well, it says here that you have six more days to make payment. Right. And that wouldn't be an issue if I had that kind of money laying around. Look, we're experiencing some financial hardships at the moment. Is, is there... [sighs] Can you tell me what our options are? [blows air] Can you borrow from family? -[Peter] No. -No. Friends? -No. -[Steven] Any 401k money? We used it for the down payment. Oh. Well, then there's nothing I can do. Mr. Hershey. Please. This is our home we're talking about. Sorry, my hands are tied. What about an extension? [sighs] Mr. Ranos, I'm sorry, but... do you know how many heart-wrenching stories I hear daily? All I'm asking for is just a little more time. Well, our private investors... set down strict rules for everyone to abide by. And my job... is to enforce those rules. Now, can you see my dilemma? Honestly, no. I can't. Ah. Well, you have six days to make payment. [Steven] And if you truly desire to keep your home, you'll find a way. Good day. [somber music] Good day. [keyboard clacking] Hey. Hey. No luck, huh? [Peter] They can't help us. Can't or won't? [Ellie] What are you doing with your father's stamp collection? Look, I know what it means to you-- We'll have some money by tonight. [somber music] [keyboard clacking] [soft music] [chiming] [Stuart] 1889 Carson City silver dollar... in good condition. This is rare. But what you're asking for, I can't do. Oh. -Look, Garrett-- -[Stuart] Stuart. -It's Stuart. -Oh. I'm sorry. [chuckles] Stuart, I bought this coin for 800 dollars, five years ago. You paid way too much. I'll give you 600. And that's being generous. Okay. What about the stamp collection? [rustling] I'll go 300. Three hundred? Your reviews online say that you're fair, and that you're honest, and that you pay top dollar. Well, my top dollar obviously is not the same as your top dollar. All right. A thousand for both. Look, I got plenty of these. Nine hundred. Take it or leave it. Huh? Fine. [Stuart] Nine hundred, sir. [Matt] Lot of those reviews are phony. They can pay people to write them. I knew it. I knew I got ripped off. [Matt] How much do you have so far? [sighs] Nine hundred. [Matt] Nope. Thirteen hundred. Absolutely not. You're doing that Greek macho thing again. I don't care. Okay. So what's next? We're definitely having a garage sale. And, uh, I also listed a few things online. Like what? Video games, uh, signed movie poster. The Chaplin one? -Yeah. -No way. I love that one. How much you asking? Matt, I know what you're doing. What? You know I like it. You're not gonna sell it to me? All right. Three-fifty. -[Matt] Sold. -No. I said 350. Sorry, no change. Plus, you're my best friends. Thanks, man. [Matt] How's Ellie? [sighs] She's, uh, under the weather. -She has a stomach virus. -Oh, man. When I had that, I couldn't smell food without puking. That's weird. Her appetite's pretty good. You sure it's a stomach virus? She's stress eating, then. I mean, this is a lot of pressure. Did she mention anything about pickles and ice cream? Ha-ha. Very funny. Look. My sister had the exact same signs, eight months later, baby herder. Oh, come on. Ellie? Pregnant? No way. Oh, I forgot, you guys don't do it. All I'm saying, is that we're careful. All I'm saying is it's possible. [Athena] I've told Peter so many times, if you kids have any problems, you should come to me right away. You know how he is. [sighs] [speaks Greek] [in Greek] Ooh, I can feel my blood pressure rising. Oh, Mama, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. I just needed to talk. Oh, I'm glad you did. Tell me, what does Peter say? [sighs] We have... We don't talk much. And, and when we do, he's... he's always in his own world. Hmm. This is a lot of pressure for anyone. [Athena] And if I know Peter, he wants to handle it himself. I guess. [Athena] Don't you worry. You have him come see me tomorrow. I will talk to him for you. No. Please don't. Are you sure? Oh, you're probably right. [Athena] We just give him some time. Ellie, you know I love you as if you are my own daughter. I can't believe you told her. I'm sorry. Please... humor me. [rustling] A pregnancy test? Come on. It really would ease my mind. I have been trying to tell you, but you have been so busy. And with everything that has been going on... [sighs deeply] I'm pregnant. You sure? I took it twice. I am not ready to be a mom. [Ellie sobs] Hey, hey. No one ever is. But why now? We have no money, and we're about to lose our home. How can we bring a baby into the world like this? [sobbing] [thunder rumbling] You're going to be a terrific mom. Just picture a little girl with your eyes and your hair running around. You know I never ask you to pray with me. -Would you tonight? -Come on, hon. Well, they say that when two or more people pray together-- Just drop it, okay? It's you and me. We got this. We can't afford for me to stop working, Peter. [Peter] I'm going to get a job, Ellie. And besides, mom's around, too. She'll help us out. She's getting older, Peter. Well, we do have friends, don't we? Let's not tell anyone just yet. Why not? Because, I don't know. Bad luck, I guess. [chuckles] Believe me, things can't get any worse. Just don't. Okay? [thunder rumbling] I'm confused. A minute ago, you're asking me to pray with you, and now, you're saying you're superstitious? How can you be both? Because... [sighs] I don't know, it's just, it's what I believe in. I'll tell you what I believe in. The 1,300 dollars I made us today, that's real. And it gets us one step closer to reaching our goal. Good night. [light switch clicks] [Peter] Good night. [clicks] [somber music] [line ringing] Hello. Yes, I see you have, uh, a job opening online. Great. Uh, well, I'd like to see if I can drop off a resume? Online only? Well, if I could just drop by for two minutes, I could-- [dial tone] Hello? [beeps] [phone clanks] [sighs] Look, Mommy. Smokey eyes. Oh, very good, sweetheart. Okay, I'll let her know. Jenny, your eleven o'clock canceled. Oh, thanks, girl. -Now, we don't have to rush. -[both chuckle] -Did you hear about Brittany? -Hear what? [Lisa] She's pregnant. [Jenny] Oh, no way. Talk about bad luck. Why? Maybe they planned it. Hmm, I doubt it. [Jenny] Remember that big teacher layoff? [Cassandra] Yeah, what about it? [Jenny] Her hubby was one of them. [Cassandra] Oh, no. [Athena] Peter, I am so upset. Why didn't you tell me? That's exactly why. [Peter] I didn't want you worrying. I feel like I'm always letting you down. Oh, Peter. You never let me down. [sighs] [Athena] Here are some things for the sale. They're all yours. Thanks, Mom. And I have this. [in Greek] Inside, 1,500 dollars. I'm sorry, I can't. [Athena] Take it now. Don't be prideful. No. You've done enough. Don't argue with me. I'm your mother. You're always taking care of us. It should be the other way around. I should be giving you money. Okay, okay. When you get the big role, you will give me lots of money. Now, you take it. I love you so much. [in Greek] [sighs] I know that you don't believe, but I will pray for you. Well, a child is a blessing. Look, I'm just saying, financially, I don't think they're ready to be parents. -[telephone rings] -Oh. Hold that thought, guys. One second. [telephone ringing] Cassie's salon. -Aunt Jenny. -Yes, sweetie? Why don't they just give the baby to a family who wants one? [Cassandra] Ellie, it's for you. -[Ellie] Who is it? -Uh... Someone named Steven. He says it's important. Excuse me, I'll be right back. Hello? Hi. Is this uh... Ell... Ellefa... Ellef... -[Steven] Ellefa... -Elleftheria. Yes, this is she. Who is this? This is Steven Hershey with Property Masters Mortgage and Trust. Now, we've been trying to reach you husband, but with no luck. Okay, how can I help you? Well, be advised that this conversation is being recorded. [Steven] Is it your intention to still keep the property? Yes. Yes, it is. [Steven] Well then, this call is to inform you that in the event that foreclosure is inevitable, and that we can't recoup our investment by, uh, selling your property, that contractually, we have the right to seek legal action for the remainder of the balance. Hello? Hello? It won't come to that. [phone beeps] [phone keypad beeping] [line ringing] [Peter] Hi, you've reached Peter. -You know what to do. -[sighs sharply] -[beeps] -[sighs] [exhales] Ellie, is everything okay? Um... Yeah. Uh, Cassie, something... Something just came up. I've... I've gotta go. Okay. I'll, I'll take care of it. -Just call me if you can. Okay? -Yeah. [somber music] [somber music continues] Uh, I'm sorry, but, uh, the waiter position has been filled. But I had an interview today. Uh... When did you fill it? About 35 minutes ago. Then why did you ask me to sit? Because I have another job opportunity. You know, one that requires a little more dedication. Okay. [chuckles] [Peter] Uh... I have managerial skills as well. I'm looking for a dishwasher. Oh. A dishwasher? Um... What's the, the pay? Minimum wage. Look, can you do any better? [Joseph] Unfortunately, I can't. I lose money with every new hire. [Peter] I hear you, but, but that's really not enough to live on. [scoffs] Thank you. We're done here. Um, I'm sorry. What just happened? I'm looking for someone who would appreciate an opportunity like this. [Joseph] Apparently, that's not you. [gloomy music] I'm closing in two minutes. Hi. Uh, I'm looking for work. Are you hiring? Oddly enough, uh, we got an opening today. [Peter] I'm dependable. And I'm really good with people. All right, slow down. [chuckles] You don't even know how much I can pay you. Um... I'm assuming it's minimum wage. It's eight dollars an hour. Plus commission. Really? Yeah. I'm interviewing in the next few days-- It would be an honor to work here. [Donald] Is that so? Yes, sir. I'm Peter. I'm Donald. You know anything about framing? Um, no, but I'm a fast learner. And hungry, too, aren't you? I won't let you down. See you tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m. Uh, I'd like to tomorrow, but I can't. I... I have a prior commitment. Oh, how about the next day? Thank you. [chuckles] Thank you so much. That's all right. Next day. There's my girl. [Peter] Thanks, hon. I was gonna jump right on it. What is it? I had the worst day. [Peter] What happened? Today's topic of conversation was about this pregnant girl with no money. And then this creep from the mortgage company called. What was his name? Steven, I think. [sighs] He said he tried reaching you. And so did I. -[cell phone chimes] -Oh, man. I forgot I turned it off. What did he want? He said that if we go into foreclosure, they can sue us for the balance we owe them. They can't do that. Yes, they can. It's in the contract. We'll get the money. I'm afraid to ask what's in there. [rustling] "Best Baby Names Ever Vol. 8" [Peter] You hate me, don't you? Hey. -I got some good news. -[sobs] Well, I sure can use some. Mom gave us 1,500 today. Oh, she's incredible. I'm gonna call her. No. Hey, hey, hey. There's more. [Peter] Guess who found a job? No way. Eight dollars an hour plus commission. Oh, yes. Where? Uh, a frame shop. That's great. Thank God. Oh, I didn't know He put in a good word. Don't be like that. Why can't you just admit for once that maybe God had something to do with it? Because if I hadn't gone in and asked, it would've never happened. It's called consequence. -[cellphone rings] -Because of your own hard work, opportunities arise. -[cellphone ringing] -Excuse me. Hello? Yes, it is. Yes, I do. It's 34 North Ridgewood Drive. Okay. Who was that? Some guy. He's coming over to take a look at something I listed online. [doorbell dings] [Leon] That's the legendary Staff of Pancratios. May I? Yeah. Oh. [soft chuckle] [gasps] [sniffs] [Leon exhales sharply] Wow. I've watched the Grecian Trials over a hundred times. It's a good movie. I'll take it. On one condition. -Look, if it's the price-- -You call me first, if you ever get your hands on a Thalosian Helmet. Deal. [light music] He sounded interesting. Oh, he sure was, but we still need 600 bucks. We are on a roll, baby. Mm, speaking of baby... Sophia, huh? How'd you know? Call it a hunch. Considering it was circled about ten times. [sucks teeth] [woman 1] If you can do any better on the table, I'll, uh, take that, too. Sure, I'll... I'll take ten off. -That works. -[Peter] Great. If you'd just give me a second... -Okay. -I'll bring it out to your car. Oh, thanks! [Matt] Brought you some stuff. I see. She's pregnant, isn't she? [Matt] I knew it. Matt, please don't say anything. She asked me to keep it quiet. You got it. It couldn't happen to two better people. -Thanks. -[Matt] Okay. Let's go. All proceeds go to the Ranos Baby Foundation. [upbeat music] [clinking] [clinking] [upbeat music] [thuds] [Ellie] Seventy-six, seventy-seven... Three hundred and seventy-eight dollars. And it's still early. Uh-oh. We got company. [sighs] Who's in charge here? Uh, I am. [bike officer] Can I see your permit for the garage sale, please? Ellie, you got it, right? No. I thought you were going to get it. It's a 200-dollar fine. Officer, obviously, there's been a misunderstanding. I don't wanna hear excuses. [officer] That's the law. It wasn't an excuse. I was merely stating a fact. [officer] Can I see your ID, please? Excuse me? Your ID. You know, I wasn't gonna give you a ticket, but now, I am. Are you serious? [officer] And I'm shutting you down. Oh, come on. Please don't do this. You should have thought about that before you started getting smart with me. I wasn't. I'm gonna be back in 30 minutes. I don't wanna see any of this stuff out here. [rasps] Understood? Yes, sir. Good. And while you're at it, pick up all the signs you got posted around the neighborhood. [wind whooshes] [water running] [Peter] I could have sworn you said you'd get it. No, I said, "I get it," like, I heard you, I understand. You know what? Just forget it. No, let's not. That's the problem, Peter. We don't communicate. We got our signals crossed. It happens, all right? [sighs] And what about that cop? Where did he come from? He just followed your signs. There's nothing mystical. Man, was he drunk with power. Yeah. Well, your attitude didn't help any. Attitude? I was making a point. Sometimes, you don't need to. You're right. I should let everyone walk all over me. [Ellie] Whatever. [gasps] [groans] Hey. You all right? Oh. Yeah. I just... I got this sharp pain. -[sighs] -[Peter] All right. Go sit down. I got this. [somber music] [dishes clinking] [sighs heavily] You should make a doctor's appointment. I'm really getting nervous. [Ellie] We have three days left, and we're nowhere where we need to be. You and Cassie are pretty close, right? Yeah. Why? Well, maybe you can ask her if we can borrow some money? No. I don't think so. [Peter] Why not? You just said we have three days left. It can't hurt to ask. This coming from a guy who hates handouts? No, no, no. This would be a real loan. With interest. [Ellie] I can't, Peter. Hon, this could solve it for us. No. I don't want anyone knowing our personal business. Okay? [Donald] As you can see, we got a wide variety of frames here. And, uh, our rule of thumb, the more decorative, the more expensive. But check out this painting. Jesus giving St. Peter the keys to the Kingdom. [Donald] But look at the frame. Check it out. If you can push that frame, you can make yourself a week in a day. That's, uh... That's great. As far as cutting, you just watch what I do. All right? You'll pick it right up. And if you don't, I'll just take it out of your paycheck. Just kidding. [chuckling] So, how long have you had this store? Well, I've only owned it for a year. I've worked here for five years. Oh, wow. So you bought it? [sighs] Not exactly. I was at a low point in my life. I needed work. And a nice man here gave me a job. Sounds familiar. [chuckles] Sadly, he passed away last year. And he left it to me. It was a miracle. -I guess. -I guess? You don't believe in miracles? Not really. [Donald] Ah. To each his own. [phone ringing] Hey, Ellie. I don't mean to pry, but I didn't hear from you. -Everything okay? -Yeah. [chuckles] Thank you for asking. [upbeat music on radio] Well, um... There is something. Your two o'clock is running late. Oh. Well, at least she didn't cancel. Hey! Let's do girls' night tonight. -[snaps fingers] -I, uh, I can't. Peter's cooking dinner for us. [Jenny] Oh, how sweet. You guys are like the cutest couple ever. [chuckles] Sorry, Ellie. What were you saying? Oh, I... I totally forgot. [chuckles] -Okay. -[both laugh] [Donald] It's pretty simple. Keep only about 200 in the register. Anything more than that, just put it straight back in the vault. -Got it? -Got it. All right. Is that your family? Yes. Three women. Must be quite a challenge. Sometimes it was. [Donald] I lost them all about six years ago. I'm sorry. I never forget them. But this helps a lot. [Peter] What is it? [Donald] It's a support group I started for... folks that have lost loved ones. Anyway, that's enough about me. What's this? You married? [chuckles] Yeah. You got kids? We just found out we're expecting. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Yeah. That's why you were so eager to get a job. [both laugh] All right. Just one other thing. This stuff about acting, it's not gonna get in the way, is it? No, I, I rarely go out. You're probably good, too. But here, take these with you. That's how you get paid. Fill them out, bring them back with you on Wednesday morning. Be on time. Will do. -See you at ten. -Sharp. [Peter] Sharp. [cellphone ringing] [beeps] Hey, Nigel. [Nigel] I guess being Greek pays off. [Peter] What does that mean? I means, they like you. You have a producer session tomorrow. 10 a.m. [thumps] Uh... Uh. [Nigel]Peter? Did you hear me? Hey... Hey, Nigel? Let me call you back. [phone clanks] [thumps] -[Peter] Hey. Thanks. -[car door opens] [instruments whirring] [metal clinks] [Peter] Hey. I'm here for the Mustang. [repo guy] Uh, Larry, I got this. You go take a look at the engine. Is this yours? License, registration, and all that noise. [Peter sighs] Give me a second. All right. That'll be, uh... six ninety-five. Six ninety-five? Well, yeah. It's the tow, and then you got a couple of unpaid parking tickets, so... Look, I don't have that kind of money. I don't know what to tell you, man. It stays here till you do. And, uh, it's 200 a night. [mumbles] Okay. Just hear me out. [Peter] My wife's pregnant. And I'm about to lose my home. Can you just help me out here? Listen, man. I'm not Dr. Phil or nothing, but, uh... we always buy used cars. [giggling] I am so glad you guys twisted my arm. It's good to be here with you. And having a cute bartender sure doesn't hurt. [blows air] He's cute. What's his name? -[Jenny] Let's find out. -[Cassandra] No! Excuse me. [whistles] -Jenny! Jen... Jen! Jenny! -[Jenny whistles] What can I do for you, ladies? Well, my girlfriend here would like to know... if... we can have another Cosmo. [Jenny] And, Ellie, what would you like? Oh, uh, another ginger Ale, please. Sure. Coming right up. [Cassandra] Okay. [all giggling] -You are so fired! -He is so fine. [all laughing] [man 1] It's all underneath. [switch clicks] [somber music] [somber music continues] Okay. So last week, I was at this really cool bar on Sunset. And this guy came up to me and said, "Bond. -James Bond." -Oh! So, I looked him dead in his eyes and said, -"Lost." -[snaps fingers] "Get lost." [all laughing] [Cassandra] Hey. You okay? Yeah. She, uh... [chuckles] She made me laugh so hard, it hurt. [laughs] [somber music] [sighs] Dear Lord, please help Ellie and Peter. They're good kids. You sold your car, Peter? [Ellie] How much did you get for it? Forty-five hundred. That's it? It's worth way more than that. [Peter] I know, Ellie. Our backs are against the wall. -So sell mine. -[Peter] No. No! We'd barely get anything for it. And besides, we need a car to get around. Well, what then? I'm selling my gold tomorrow. Our jewelry? I was hoping you'd help us out, too. [somber music] [clinking] This, too? Please. [somber music] [clinks] -I hate to ask this, but-- -What now? [Peter] What about that thick gold necklace? The one with the matching earrings? [Ellie] No! Absolutely not! I gave you all of mine. Those were my grandmother's. -[sighs] -[button clicks] [female news reporter] Our new reports show, evidence found of continued economic-- [TV turns off] Do you want to save our home or not? I'm not selling them. That's all I have to remember her by. My dad's ring is all I have to remember him by. Well, that's your choice. My choice? You think I wanted to sell my car or my dad's stamp collection? I'm sorry you had to, okay? But we wouldn't even be in this mess if it wasn't for you. No. It's not just me! You're the one who left the envelope in the car! Or did you forget about that? Mine wasn't intentional! You lied to me! [Peter] What-- To protect you! Oh, so you're doing this for me? [Ellie] Please! What does that mean? You said yourself, Peter. You wanted to land a big role and save the day. Remember? You-- is it so bad to want to spoil you? Spoil me? How? By making me sell my wedding and engagement rings, and then harassing me for my grandmother's jewelry? Okay. That's enough. You think this is easy for me? I'm done. Do what you want. [sighs heavily] [sobs] Okay, three, two, and one. [instructor] Good job. All right. Stretch it out. Stretch it out. [switch clicks] [instructor] Come on. Let's wrap it up -[Peter panting] -[thwacking] [Roland] Peter, come on. Time to go. [panting] [thwacking] [rasps] [Peter] Sorry. I didn't hear you. Uh, listen, we need to talk. [Peter] Sure. What's up? Your membership. It's overdue. Oh, man. Can I pay next month? Look. I really need this place right now. Then don't make it a habit, okay? [Peter] Thanks, Roland. Hey. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Have you ever felt like no matter how hard you try, things just still go wrong? Many times. What do you do? I let go and let God. Yeah, but how do you get by when you start to doubt yourself and everything that you do? By turning to God, I take it out of my hands and leave it in His. [Roland] It's less pressure. Talk to Him. You'll find he's compassionate and caring. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Peter, wait. Let me ask you. You're playing a basketball game, and it's the last shot for the win. Would you take it? Or would you give it to Michael Jordan? [Velcro rasps] [sighs deeply] [clinking] [somber music] Thank you, Ellie. [Peter] Baby, you're pale. Mm. I couldn't sleep. [Peter] Your hands are freezing. I'm fine. Go get it. [Ellie] It's yours. Okay. [Peter] I'll be back to take you to work. [smooches] [groans] [panting] [groans] Ellie, have you seen my wallet? [Peter] I found it. I love you. Ellie? Ellie? Hey. [tires screeching] [line ringing] [sighs] -[door closes] -[phone ringing] [phone beeps] Onassis. Are you at the audition? Uh, no. I'm at the hospital. What happened? [Peter]It's not me. It's Ellie. Is she okay? [indistinct PA announcement] We don't know yet. [sighs] [Peter] Look... I don't think I'm going to make the audition. [Nigel] Peter, this is big. It's a producers session. Believe me, I want to. But until I know what's going on, I can't. [sighs] Okay. [Nigel] I'll let them know. Thanks. [phone beeps] Peter. Thanks for coming. What happened? How's Ellie? I don't know. They're running tests. Mr. Ranos, this is Dr. Sisti. He needs to speak with you. Mr. Ranos, we have a medical emergency. Your wife is two months pregnant but it's ectopic. What is that? [Dr. Sisti] Well, in a normal pregnancy, the fetus grows in the uterus. In your wife's case, it's growing in her fallopian tube, and it ruptured. [Dr. Sisti] She's bleeding internally, and if she bleeds any more, she will die. So, we need your consent to operate now. Of course! I mean, do what you need to do. Can I see her? I'm sorry, but we need to prep her for surgery. Sir, I need you to go the waiting room. Mr. Ranos, I need you to follow me. Mr. Ranos, I know this is extremely difficult, but we do need your signature. I need you to initial here, here, and we need you to sign here. Please. -You were just with her. -[nurse] Mm-hm. How is she? Your wife's an extremely strong lady. And believe me, she's in great hands. Dr. Sisti and his team are actually the very best. Good. Good. Now, the surgery is going to take a couple hours, barring any complications. How's the baby? Mr. Ranos, I'm, I'm very sorry. But usually in these cases, the fetus doesn't survive. We're more concerned about saving your wife right now. Thank you. [tense music] [somber music] [panting] [dramatic music] [whimpers] [sniffles] [sighs] Last time we spoke... [sobs] ...you took a man away from me I loved dearly. From that day... [sighs] ...I swore to take the matters into my own hands. [pants] But now, I don't know what to do. [sniffles, pants] They say you're compassionate... and caring. Show me. [somber music] [man over PA] Paging Dr. Kimble to the ICU. Dr. Kimble to ICU. Hey. [Matt] How are you holding up? It's, uh... It's a lot all at once. I can imagine. I think it's over for the house. No way. Why? I was going to sell our jewelry today, but... that's not going to happen. [Matt] When's the deadline? Five p.m. tomorrow. All I know is when she gets out of here, Ellie's gonna need her home. Listen, go do what you gotta do. I'm here. I'll keep you posted. I can't leave here. I can't. They say the surgery is gonna take two hours. Okay? So... You're just gonna be sitting here with me. [Matt] Think about it. [phone ringing] [phone beeps] -Hello. -[Nigel] Sorry, Peter. Casting just called. A 12:15 slot has opened up. What should I tell them? Hi, Peter. Glad you could make it. Uh, this is one of our producers. Hello. Um, I'll be reading with you. [director] Let's do it with a Greek accent. So, whenever you're ready. You're sure you heard screaming coming from the alley at 10 p.m.? Yes. And why are you so sure? My favorite show starts at 10. I have no further questions, Your Honor. [inaudible dialogue] Thanks, Peter. Yeah. Well, just have them deliver them. Room 41B. All right. Bye. -Excuse me. -Hmm? Can you tell me, is Ellie Ranos in surgery? You were here earlier with her husband, right? Yeah. We're best friends. Oh, she's been asking for him. Oh, he just stepped out for a bit. He'll be right back. [nurse] Well, they're getting ready to take her in now. Why don't you come on, and go with me. [Matt] Yes, ma'am. [clinks] Okay. [Alex] 18 karat. You know what, to get you an accurate price, I have to do two things. I have to do an acid test to make sure the gold is real. And then I have to melt it all down. Is that okay with you? -Yeah. -[Alex] Okay. I also see you have a stone here. I'll get you a price on that as well. Here. [Alex] Okay. Take me about 15 minutes. Uh, watches. We don't do watches here, actually. [Alex] So, have a seat. -Bottle of water? -No, thanks. [somber music] [somber music continues] [clinking] [clicks] [flames roar] Here's your nugget. So what I can do, is I can give you 1,100 dollars for the stone, and 1,300 for the gold. That's only 2,400. And I'm giving you my best price. [gloomy music] [sighs] [heartbeat] [somber music] [heartbeat] [keys clicking] [car engine starts] Well, hello, my friend. Hey, how are you? Better now that you're here. Thanks. [Peter chuckles] No one's ever greeted me like that before. Well, if you can't be nice to someone now, when can you be, right? Um... I guess there's always heaven, huh? I guess so. -You work here? -Oh, no, no, no. You know, just as soon as I saw you walk up, I knew you were the one. Excuse me? I was at home, minding my own business, when God told me to come here... and tell a man that everything's gonna be okay. I was sitting in my car and I heard a voice, telling me to go to the bank. This is no coincidence. All right. You got my attention. You doubt God. -How do you know that? -[man chuckles] [man] God loves you. I don't think so. But in order to gain that love, you've got to surrender. You've got to start leaning on Him. Jesus wants to give you the keys to the kingdom. Hold on. I just got a, a job at a frame store., and there's this painting. It's called, Jesus gives St. Peter the Keys to the Kingdom. [chuckles] Whoa! Yeah. This is no coincidence. All right. I'm Peter. Call me Tony. God wants to help you, Peter. But you're not letting Him in. I did once. But then, life changed. Life happens. Even though you got discouraged, and, um... you gave up on Him, He never gave up on you. You gotta give Him another chance. His arms are wide open. Jesus wants to take your troubles, Pete. [chuckles] I'd like that. [chuckles] I really do. Then open your heart. And accept Him as your Lord and Savior. -I don't think I can. -He's reaching out to you. It's your choice. [sighs] Okay. Yeah? Yes. Peter. Do you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior? I do. [Tony] Good. Good. Let's pray. Father God... bring Peter into Your fold. He comes to You willingly. He receives You. Forgive him of his sins. [Tony] And guide him in his path. Amen. Mark the time. What? -What time is it? -Oh. It's 5:38. [Tony] At this very moment, all of the angels in heaven are rejoicing. Peter... you gotta know that everything is gonna be okay. [chuckles] [cellphone ringing] [phone beeps] Hey. -I'm on my way. -[phone beeps] Hey, Matt. How is she? Sleeping. But they're keeping a close eye on her. [Matt] How'd you make out? We're short. How much? Nineteen hundred. I even sold her engagement ring. Man, I'm sorry. Me, too. Listen, if you need me, you call me. Thanks for everything, man. Hey. Hang in there. [somber music] [machine beeping] [beeping continues] [Ellie sighs] Yeah. Hey. Boy, look at those beautiful eyes. [sighs] [Peter] Here. [Ellie sighs] How do you feel? There's this emptiness. Do you remember anything? [Ellie] I remember... trying to get up, and then... this awful pain. And then, nothing. You were bleeding internally. The baby? What about the baby? [smooches] I'm sorry. [whimpers] Was it a boy or a girl? It was too early to tell. [sobs] [Ellie whimpers] [knocking on door] -Morning. -Hey, doc. You're a very lucky woman. [Dr. Sisti] We caught the bleeding in time. Labs look good. Vitals are stable. Do you have any questions for me? What about children? Can I still have them? We had to remove one fallopian tube. But you still have one left. [gasps] So conceivably, yes. [sighs deeply] -[smooches] -[Ellie sniffles] [ticking] [phone ringing] [ringing continues] [Peter on recording] Hi. You've reached, Peter. You know what to do. [phone clicks] [Peter] Talking to him was... strange, yet, yet comforting. But we're still going to lose our home. After we prayed, he said everything would work out. You prayed with him? -Yeah. -[soft thud] Hey, how ya doing? I checked in on you earlier, but you both were asleep. Anyway, your friend Matt stopped by earlier. He wanted me to give you that. He said you'd know what to do with it. How ya feeling? All right. I'm gonna check in on you a little bit later, okay? And if you need anything, you just hit that button, girl. -[clicks tongue] -All right. What is it? I don't know. [uplifting music] [Peter] "It was my grandmother's. I was saving it for the right girl, but we both know that may take a while. Finish this." [smooches] I'll be back. [Yvonne] Okay. Here you go. [distant phone ringing] Thank you. Anything else I can help you with? Maybe. Do you know an older gentleman named Tony that banks here? We have a lot of those. Well, he's tall, he's, uh, charismatic. He wears a suit with a baseball cap. It sounds like you mean Mr. Sotiris. Unfortunately, he passed away last year. Definitely not the one I'm talking about. Thank you. We're so glad you're okay. Hey, we heard you were quite the trooper. Hm. I passed out from the pain. [Jenny] Yeah, but look at you. No makeup, and you still look gorgeous. -[all chuckle] -[Jenny] It really isn't fair. [all laughing] [sighs] Oh, no. [sighs] [keypad clacking] [phone ringing] Hold on one second. FramePros. Hi, Donald. It's Peter. Peter, I'm busy with a customer. [dial tone beeps] [phone beeps] [somber music] Donald. I am so sorry. -Please. -[Donald] Peter. I'm a stickler for punctuality. Believe me, it was out of my control. Sorry. I've been burned too many times. Just hear me out. -[Donald] Can I help you? -[customer] Yeah. I'm looking for something stylish for this. [Donald] That's nice. Let's talk back here. [Peter] The doctor said you're healing well. There's a good chance you'll be getting out tomorrow. I can't help but wonder if it was a little Sophia, like you wanted. Oh, Ellie. I keep seeing her in my mind. [Peter] Please don't. [sobbing] It just hurts so much. [sniffles, sighs] [Peter] I know, Ellie. I know. [Rosie] They say you're supposed to grow old together. Well, that's not guaranteed. What hurts the most is... [sighs] I'll never be able to hold him, or... tell him I love him, or... how sorry I am for all the stupid little things. [sobs] I wonder... does that pain ever go away? A good friend of mine... she told me losing someone that she loves, was like losing a finger. You can still use your hand, but you'll always miss that finger. Is there anyone else who would like to share? [Peter] I would. Hi. I'm Peter. [tranquil music] [Ellie] It's okay. Put me down. The doctor said to keep you off your feet. I'm sure this isn't what he had in mind. -Okay. Here we are. -[Ellie chuckling] It's beautiful. It's from Donald, my boss from the frame shop. Anthony Sotiris. [Ellie] I've never heard of him. Call me Tony. Welcome home. [smooches] [Peter] I never noticed how peaceful it was out here. That's because we never did this. I'm sorry I took you for granted, Ellie. [Peter] It won't happen again. Just shush and kiss me. [phone ringing] [Peter] It's Nigel. Do you mind? [chuckles] No. [phone rings, beeps] Hey, Nigel. Any news? It's time to renew our contract. [Nigel] I'll be at the office in 20 minutes. Can you come by? How's tomorrow morning? [Nigel] Okay. See you then. [Peter] Bye. -[phone beeps] -What's up? He wants to renew our contract. So, what are you waiting for? No. I'm here with you. Peter, acting is your business. I know. Then go handle it. You're serious? One hundred percent. I love you. [tranquil music] Here you go. Wait. What's this? Persistence pays off. Congratulations. [Nigel] You booked it. No way. [Nigel] It works two days next week. With the possibility of the role recurring. -Thank you. -[Nigel] Nah. Thank yourself. You did it. [calm music] [Steven] With your new job, it looks like your household income meets our criteria. You now qualify for our loan modification program. Terrific. Terrific! Listen, give me a couple of days to get the paperwork together, and then we'll be in touch. Sounds great. Thank you. Well... I'm glad it could work out, Mr. Ranos. And I hope you know that it was never personal. It's always been business. I'll wait for your call. If I had known, I would have come to visit you. I told him not to say anything. Okay, Mom. The truth is-- I know, I know, I know, you don't want me worrying. But I'm your mother, I will always worry. Fair enough. Oh, I'm so glad to have both of you here. -[smooches] -Oh! Oh, just one moment. -Here you go. -[Ellie] Oh, yum. The pastitsio looks so good. Anything for my kouklitsa. [chuckles] Would you take this to the table for me? Because of my arthritis is-- No, no, no. I got it. [Ellie] But I can do it. Let him spoil you. I heard that. -Mind your own business. -[Ellie laughing] [doorbell rings] [gasps] Matt! How are you? [smooches] Thank for all you did. Just feed me for life and we're even, Mrs. Ranos. [laughs] Okay. It's a deal. [Athena] No problem. -[Matt] Hi, princess. -Hi. [smooches] Please sit down. -Oh. -[Peter sighs] Now, everybody, I want all of us to take a moment to give thanks. [Peter] Uh, Mom. If it's okay, I'd like to do it. Yes. Okay. [Peter] Dear God, thank you for bringing Ellie home to us safe. And thank you for bringing us all together here today. Amen. [all] Amen. Is he okay? -[chuckles] -What? Nothing, nothing, nothing. [all laugh] [Athena] I want you all to save room for dessert, because I made Baklava. Oh! My favorite. You don't have to twist my arm, Mom. [Ellie chuckling] Peter, I made it with light syrup. One piece is not going to make you fat. Come on. Peter... -[Athena] Come on, now. -[Matt] Come on. [all laughing] -[Matt] Eat it! -Okay! Sheesh! One piece. Yay! [Athena] Good. [speaking Greek] -Over here. -[Athena speaks Greek] -[Peter] Dig in. -[Matt] Mm. Meatballs. [Ellie] Oh, wow. Please, please save some for me. [mockingly] [Matt] "Save some for me." Dream on! [all laughing] [Peter] So now, you know my journey. It sure wasn't easy, but I guess, you can say, that I finally found my way. As for Tony... I never did see him again. But I'll always be grateful to him for that special day at the bank for helping me make my heavenly deposit. [uplifting music] [uplifting music continues]
