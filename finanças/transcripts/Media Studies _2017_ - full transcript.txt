- Sorry ladies. - What the fuck are you doing? - Yeah, we need your camera. - So do we. - Alright Jess eh, Ruz, why are you such an arsehole? - Oh cheers, Charlie. No, Kallis said we could have the camera for Media Studies in about 10 minutes, so. - Well we just wanna try and get it before everyone else gets it. - Yeah, but you've got one there, why are you pissing us around? - Because that one there, Charlie, is the best one, and you guys are just dancing, so can you just have this one here? That fine? - Fine, whatever, just take it. - Are you coming? - Yeah, give me five minutes. - Er, Charlie? Forgetting something? - Okay, so this is your final term project, how are you feeling? - Okay. - Yeah, good? It's a documentary, but this time what I want you to do, I want you to get me some DVD extras, okay? So I want behind the scenes footage, video diaries, that kind of thing. Any questions? - No. It's cool. - No fighting over the camera. - Ooh, a little bit jealous are we guys? - Oh piss off Raz. - Oh Raz, I see you found the camera. - Of course. - Here it is, folks, your end of year project. It's a documentary, but this time, I want one of you filming the filming, okay? I wanna see some DVD extras, behind the scenes footage, video diaries, that kind of thing. Okay? - Mhmm. - Any questions? - Nope. - Good. Okay, good luck. - Oh, how's your film coming along by the way, sir? - Which one, Raz? - Dunno, any of them? - Yeah, good, thanks. - Are we gonna see 'em in the cinema then, Mr. Cubrick, or just on the internet? - Shut up Raz! - What, he's supposed to be a film studies teacher, have you seen any of his shit? It just makes it embarrassing. - Okay, DVD extras. - Right, immediately, I have a really good idea. It's about something I'm very familiar with, it's a booming industry. - We're not doing a film about porn, Raz. - Why? I've done the research. Extensive. - Shut up. - He's only joking, babe. - Just lighten up a bit, Charlie, come on. I do actually have a serious idea though. You know my cousin, my cousin Michael. He works at the, well basically I have a cousin that works at the Arsenal ground, and I reckon that he can show us around, then we can do a little cheeky film about football. - You can strut around like Danny fucking Dyer, no I don't think so. - Well I'm feeling proper naughty. - Shut up, I hate football. - Look, we can make it professional, like, we can do it about player wages, and ticket prices, and all that kind of stuff, so. - And that'll be so fuckin' boring. - Well, for you, yes, because you don't like football. A lot of people enjoy football. - Yeah, alright, but I've actually got a sensible idea, that everyone will probably find interesting. - Okay, this'll be good to hear. - Okay. - Come on. - Bullying. Right? - Oh my god, no. - So we chat to some people who have been bullied in the school. - No. - We talk to some members of the-- - No. - Shh, we talk to some members of the public. - No. - Why are you saying? - I'm not doing a film about bullying, Charlie. - Why? - Because it's incredibly GCSE, it's something that you do, isn't it, the PHSE or something in year seven, I'm not doing a film about bullying. - Okay, wait, I've got a better idea. What about cyber bullying? So it's still bullying, but on the internet. Yeah? - That's-- - Slightly more interesting? A bit more up to date. - Yes it's a bit, yeah it's more up to date. - And I bet there's loads of stuff. - Well, more people are getting cyber-bullied nowadays than actually physically bullied. As I said, it's more of a 90s thing to get physically bullied. - Well yeah, it's like the modern-day bullying. - Yeah. - So basically, what I just said. - Yeah but better. Yeah, are we cool? - Okay, so we have an idea, yeah? - I'm cool with it. Cool with it? Cool with Jess's idea? Cool, she's fine, she's fine. - Great. - Let's do it. - Oh hey, uh, Mrs Miller. Just looking for my shoes, and yeah, can't find them. Do you need some help with the washing up? Spare set of hands? No? More soap? - Hello! - So, what are you lot up to? We've got a new project. - Oh, that sounds exciting. - Not really. We've gotta make a documentary. - Really, what about? - Charlie here wanted to make it about porn, Mrs Miller, but I persuaded her it was degrading to women, so. - Ignore him, mum. - Can I get you something to drink? - No thank you. - I could make you some sandwiches? - Ooh. - No, no, we're fine. - I'm good, thank you. - Thanks Mrs Miller. - Thanks mum. - You so fancy her. - Way out of my league. - Yeah. - Right, so we've decided on cyber-bulling, yeah? - Mhmm. - I reckon it could be really good. I've seen loads of articles online, so we could pinch some of that and stick it in. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, but who are we going to actually interview? - We need to find out if anyone's actually been bullied. Do you reckon they might let us see the like, files and records at school? - I doubt it. We could ask Mr Kallis. He might let us interview him. - Ooh, you so fancy him. - Piss off. Interviews, records. - You found anything? - Not really. - First of all, I'm gonna say, shotgun behind the camera. - Well I'm really shit in front of a camera, so, sure? - Yeah whatever you decide. - Do you mind? Let's write something, seeing as we can't really use that. Might just give me five minutes? - Mhmm. Whatevs. - Fuck, I'm so sorry guys. I can't remember, um. - Smooth. - Sorry. - Really smooth. - Kids have always been bullied, but in the last 10 years, a new trend has changed the way that bullies operate forever. This film hopes to find out, use social media to find out, how kids can make their so-called friends' lives a living hell, and aims to discover the reasons behind their actions. - You're a natural, babe. - That was great, Charlie. - Love it. - Sarcastic bastard. - Joking. - Shall we go to the pub? - Yes please. - Sounds like a plan, but I need to go home for a bit, so I'll come back around seven-ish. - Okay. - Yeah that's fine. - Yeah, alright that's a wrap. - We love you, Charlie. - I don't think she means to do it, it's just when she gets really stressed out. She's really sweet, like, she thinks about everyone-- Charlie! - Where the fuck have you been? - It's only quarter past, I had to run the last mile. Don't you two look nice today for our little meeting. - Are you gonna go get us a drink? - What, can you not get served all dolled up like that? - Pass me the real one. - That's quite a surprise. - What is this? - What? - This thing. - Er, that is a camera. - But it's pink, Raz. - Yeah, what? - It looks like a little girl's phone. - Have you stolen it from a child? - Well am I talking to children? Because that's what it feels like. Feels like you two are about five. No I thought we could just use it to film-- - We're five? - Yeah. - Oh okay. - We could use it to film the behind the scene stuff. I asked Kallis if maybe you guys can use it, and-- - Oh that's nice of you. - What? - 'Cause we're not capable of doing anything ourselves. - Well not the actual main documentary film, but you can do the behind the scenes. - Oh okay, is it good quality? - Yeah it's full HD. Actually, come here, look. I'll show you the quality. - Yeah, it should be fun. - So yeah, it's just a cut-away shot of the uh, stairs at college. Um you can use it for other stuff, like establishing maybe us doing some... What? What? - Woah, nice trainers sir. - Is there a problem, Raz? - No, four stripes is fine, really. It's good. - Right, so come on then, what did you want to see me about? - What brand are they, sir? - Raz, they're just trainers. - Yeah, I'm sure they are, in a way. - Sir, we were just wondering if we could see the school records for bullying. - What records? - Well there must be something written down somewhere about who's been bullied and that. - Yeah, probably is, but you can't see it. And what's this all about, guys? - Well we're doing our documentary on cyber-bulling, so we just wanted to see some details about whether it happens in college. - Charlie wanted to make a documentary about porn, but I told her it was degrading to women. - For fucks sake Raz, that joke is getting way old now. - Charlie language, enough Mr Scott. - He's just snide little dick anyway. - What? - You always go on about watching porn, just 'cause I'm not one of those slags that'll sleep with you at the drop of a fuckin' hat. - Charlie, enough. Way too much information. Look guys, I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you with this. Why don't you do some research on Rosy Clarke? The girl that ran away a couple of weeks ago. Apparently she was being cyber-bullied, it was all over the papers. Well your sister reported on it, right Jess? For the Gazette? - Yeah. - Well maybe she can help. - That's a really great idea, sir. - Well go on then, off you go. Oh Charlie, can I have a word for a sec? - Four-stripes wanker. - Okay, so after a tip-off, we've decided to dig deeper into the case of missing 17 year old Rosy Clarke. She ran away from school on the 21st of June. What have you found out, Raz? - Well, after looking at her status updates for the past year, We've found that she was being bullied by a number of people at school, and the one name that keeps cropping up is Mitch Camelen. - Who was expelled from school earlier this year. I think we should see what he has to say. - Let's give him a ring. - Turn it off. - Look, he said he'll ring, and I trust him. - You trust him? - Mhmm. - You're a shit judge of character, Raz. - Yup. Oh there we go, see. Told you no one can resist me. - Ah, speakerphone, knob-head. - Oh yeah. Right, so basically, Mitch, we'd like to talk to you about Rosy Clarke. Did you know she ran away from home? - Yeah it's fuck all to do with me, mate. Seriously. - Well, we saw quite a few of your posts on her home page, and you weren't exactly nice to her. - Look, we had a bit of the thing on there, we used to send each other pictures and shit. - What sort of pictures? - You know, dirty stuff. It was just bits and pieces, really. Look, at the end of the day she wouldn't put out, so I just got rid, mate. - Is that why you got expelled? Cause of that? - It was bollocks. My tutor reckoned that she'd had loads of complaints, like, from loads of mums and stuff. - What about? - Fuck all, really. - Well it must have been about something. - Look, I was putting about a bit at college, well like, shagging and stuff. I'd done eight girls, the term before I got chucked out. One on them got pregnant, didn't she? - Wait, eight? And they expelled you for that? - Dude they were fuckin' furious when they found out how many. Harford was there, Banford, Kallis. They went fucking mental. Look, mate, I'm better off outta there now to be honest. Anyway, I'm into older birds and stuff now. Over 30 and that. - Really? Where do you find them? - Oh for fucks sake, Raz! - Alright cut, cut. Alright, cheers Mitch. Woah, 30. Yo. Bad news. Camelen didn't know much about Rosy, other than she likes to send the odd dirty picture. So what are we gonna do? - Maybe we could see if we could talk to Rosy's family? - Mhmm. - They're not going to talk to us, Charlie, come on. They might talk to your sister, Jess. - I don't want to ask Kate, not again. - Okay. - Can't we just start again? Do the whole football thing? - No, look, we haven't got time. Can't we just hand in what we've done already and pad it out with some behind the scenes shit? - Uh, no, Charlie, some of us need to pass this. Okay, um. Why don't we just pretend that one of us was bullied. You know, Charlie you could do it. You're the best actor out of all of us. Do you reckon you could cry onscreen if you needed to? - Why have I gotta do everything? - Everything? Charlie, all you done so far yeah, is mess up the opening bit, and then just moan about everything else. Charlie, you haven't done shit. - Alright. - You are such a wanker, Raz. - Oh my god, Charlie, I just said you were the best actor out of all of us, and that's what you're gonna-- - No, I won't put up with this-- - Oh my god, Charlie, you're such a diva. - Fuck you. - Okay, real mature. Yep, see you later. Jesus - Seriously Raz, you are such a twat. - Don't start, Jess. - So what are we gonna do? - I dunno, we could go back to mine, maybe, do some editing. You know, plus my parents are at my sister's, so. - Stop it Raz. - Alright, fair enough. Worth a try. Okay, here we are, er, on this fine evening. And we are doing what, today, Jess? - We're editing our scenes. - Woo. - Yay. - For the-- - Documentary? - DVD... - Extras! - DVD extras. - So much fun. - And what am I filming the DVD extras on? - I'm not 10, you can just say. What are you filming it on? - Our DVD extras camera, which is filming our documentary camera, filming us watching us. Camception. - So mind-blowing. - I'm gonna make a tea, do you want one? - Ah, no thanks. - Alright, suit yourself. You sure? - Yeah. - I make a damn fine herbal tea. - Okay. - Ow, that hurt. - Okay. - I'm gonna have to talk you through it then, if you're doing it. - No you do not, only my gosh. - Have you edited before? - You're such a control-freak. Have I edited before? Yes, I have. - It's still. - Why is it doing that? Charlie? Charlie? Should we go round the back? - Yeah. - It's open. - Yeah well that's safe. - Charlie? Charlie! Do you think she's gone out? - No idea. - Charlie, your door was open. - Hey Jess, look. - I know. So cute. - Yeah, that's the word. - Look at those cheeks. Hello. - Guys, seriously, look at this. - What? Do you know her, then? - No! - That's weird. - Raz, stop filming. Come and have a look at this. - That is really, really weird. - Hi, we got a call from this address. Is everything okay? - Yeah, do you know that missing girl? - Which one? - Rosy Clarke? - Yes, that's an ongoing case. Is there something you know about it? - Um, I got a message today, and it says help me, and an address. - It's a prankster. We know who it is. He sends texts to the parents and friends of missing kids. - Seriously? - He's sick. Listen, I'll take down the number and look into it back at the station. I will need to take your details as well, if that's okay. - Where do you think she is? - Who, Rosy? We don't know. - Do you want to come in then? - Thanks. - Sorry. - We're here at Baiton forest, and we're looking for the address that we believe to have been to sent to us by Rosy Clarke. The police haven't been very helpful, and they've told us that they believe the texts have been sent to us by hoaxers. Hopefully we can find out. - It's in the middle of fucking nowhere. - Mhmm. - Raz, are you sure this is right? - Look, I typed the postcode into maps and this is where it's sending us, so. Go that way. - I fuckin' hate forests. - How can you hate forests? - Dunno. Blair witch probably. - It's my project. It's ruined. It was Charlie's fault. - Oh my god Raz, shut the fuck up. - It was Charlie, she fucked it up. - Fucking idiot. Ugh. Fucks sake. - There's supposed to be a house up here, apparently. I don't think so. - According to Raz's shitty maps. - Wait. - Jess? - Eh, excuse me? - Yeah, how can I help? - Is this Rosy Clarke's house? - Yes. What do you want? - Are you her dad? - Yeah. - Um, we're doing a documentary on cyber-bulling, and we think we've got something you might wanna see. - Okay. Come in. - So we think we've had a text from Rosy, but we think she's okay. - Look, I know you think you're doing the right thing, but we get this a lot. She's run away before. She's probably just at a friend's house. - No, we know about the pranks Mr. Clarke, and we don't think it's that, because she knew your address. - Look. All from bastards who think it's funny to ridicule us. Now how do you want your tea? - Do you mind if we maybe look in her room? - What for? - Oh I don't know, just to see if we can find any clues or that? - Clues? - Don't worry if it's too much, it's asking a lot. - Bloody thing. Um, okay, do whatever you need to upstairs, alright? - Thank you. Oh look, here she is. - That one there's Mr Clarke, dad of the year. What? - Oh, biker boyfriend maybe? - Hmm, biker boyfriend. Fiery red-head. - Makes sense. - Match made in heaven. Hmm. She's a pretty girl. - Mr Clarke? Mr Clarke, do you know if Rosy's got a laptop we can have a look at? - Mr Clarke! Mr Clarke! - Hello? - Bit rude. - I know. - I'm guessing that's a no. - If there was a laptop, it'd be in here. - Yeah, but it's not though, is it? - It probably is, in a drawer or something. - It's not, I've checked. - Charlie's just looking for anything she can keep, apparently. Fuckin' hell! Who are you? - Rosy's sister. Dad tells me you're trina find Rosy. - Yeah, we're doing this documentary about cyber-bullying. - She wasn't cyber-bullied. That was bollocks. - What do you mean? - The real reason she ran was him. He took my sister. - What do you mean he took? - He's a bastard! He manipulates girls, he like, grooms them and stuff. - What's his name? It's Seth Bridger. If you want a real story for your film, you should talk to him. - Shit, have you told the police? - Yeah. They said they'd go and see him. - Where does he live? - For fucks sake Raz. - I don't know, sorry. Are you guys done, or? - Yeah. - I guess we are. - So what we're gonna do, we're gonna drop this frame into the timeline here-- - Oi oi, what's going on here then? Are you alright Evie, how's things? - Good thanks, you? - Yeah, good. What are you doing tonight, by the way? Not a lot, I'm just-- - Uh, um, sorry to interrupt, but uh, did you want something Raz? - Oh yeah, do you know that Seth Bridger? - Uh yeah, I think so. He was a student here when I started, why? - Well you know that Rosy Clarke girl that ran away? - Yes. - Well, we talked to her sister, and she reckons that Seth Bridges got her, and that's why she didn't come home. - Bloody hell Raz, that's a pretty big accusation. You need to be careful saying stuff like that. - Oh, you know, can we just interview him for the film then, or what? - I don't think so Raz, do you? - Why? - Why? There's no why about it. Just don't do it, it's ridiculous. Alright, cheers sir. - Is there anything else? - Nope, we're good. All good. Ooh, that'll be shit. Okay. Yeah, yeah, thanks for talking to me. We'd like to talk to you about Seth Bridger. Is that okay? Oh great, okay, so what time would be the best to call you? Okay. Okay, awesome, right. I'll speak to you in a bit. Bye. Hi Helena, thanks again for doing this. - That's alright, what do you wanna know? - Okay, first of all I just wanna say that we're doing this media studies documentary film kind of think about cyber-bullying, and we're looking into why Rosy Clarke ran away from home. Do you know her? - Oh yeah, that's the girl on the news. - Yeah, yeah that's her. - Well how is Seth involved then? - Well we're not entirely sure, but we know that they were seeing each other, or at least together for a while. - Well, what he doing with her? She was a kid. - Like we really don't know, that's why we were contacting you, basically. Rosy's sister said, well, she reckoned that Seth was grooming Rosy. - What? No, no, no. Seth wouldn't do that. It's bollocks. I mean, he can be a bit weird, you know, but he's not into anything like that. No way. - What do you mean, weird? - Well, you know, he's just a bit quiet. But he's alright, he's a nice guy. - So uh, do you know where he might live now, or? - No, I think he still works at the same place though. - Okay, where's that? - Oh, he's a security guard at that Wit and Fort. He used to work nights. - Awesome, right, that's great. Is there anything else that we might need to know, or? - Uh, I've got his old mobile number, you might wanna give it a try? - Yeah, yeah. That'd be awesome. - Okay. - This number is no longer recognised. I'm sorry, this number is no longer recog-- - Look, guys, how awesome is it gonna be to get an interview with him on tape? Who else is gonna be doing this sort of shit? - What, interviewing kidnappers? Yeah, probably no one Raz. - Look, I'm gonna go down there, see if I get him to talk to me on camera, can you two go up there and get some shots of me please? - Why, Raz? - Cutaways, Charlie, you know. Film-making stuff. Look, can you take the camera and a torch, please? - So, where do you wanna go next? - To be honest, Jess, I really couldn't give a shit. Can we just pretend we're doing something? Oh dear. - I don't even know what he wants to do. He can do it himself. - I'm so cold. - So am I. Should we just go back and wait in the car? - Nah, he'd do. He might get a bit angry. - Not up for a strop? We'll just get some crap. - It wouldn't make a change. Yeah, yeah. This is so pointless. - We could go and get a shot of the river. - Why? - Fun and exciting! - Okay, this is the lovely East Uton, and a lovely ferry. Brilliant. And over here to the right, we can see there is a big old pile of shit. Brilliant. Jess, do you know what, can we just leave this now? I'm fuckin' freezing. Jess? Oh for fucks sake. Jess? Jess? - Awwww, I told him not to do it. - Fuck. You're such a twat. It was so good. - Fucking assholes. - She look scared. Say sorry, she looks scared. - Charlie I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Get the fuck away from me. - Oh I'm sorry, I feel bad now. - Okay, so Charlie's in a bit of a mood. - Fuck off Raz. - Anyway, so Seth Bridger doesn't work here any more, but the bloke who does, bit of a weirdo, gave me his address so we can go and see him. We've got to go, the police aren't going to do fuck all, Jess. No, no, yeah, I know what she said. I reckon you know, she'll be well proud if we can find how he's the reason why Rosy ran off. Okay, okay, fuck it, fine then, me and Charlie will go on our own. Yep, bye. Alright, I'm Raz Scott, and welcome to the world's creepiest man. Tonight we're outside the gaff of Seth Bridger, Now I've heard he's quite a nasty piece of work. I've heard he likes to groom women, sometimes rape 'em, but that's all accusation. - Cheers Raz, chuffed, so go on do it properly now. Go. - Alright, tonight we're at the address that we believe to be Seth Bridger's house, and he's the guy that's been accused of grooming Rosy Clarke, and so we're gonna go inside and see if we can get his side of the story. - Right, you can knock. This is fucked up. - Don't worry about it. It'll be fine. Seth? Seth Bridger? - What? - Hi Mr Bridger, I'm Raz Scott, and this is Charlie Miller, and we're making a documentary for media studies. - Yeah, great, what do you want? - Well we were talking to Rosy Clarke's sister, and she said that you had a relationship with Rosy, you know the girl who ran away. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah I don't know where she is. - What? - You're gonna ask me if I know where she is, and I don't. - Well, maybe-- - Well, wait, did you take her? - Fuck off. Take her where? - Is she here? - No. Look, the police have already interviewed me, and they found nothing. - What the fuck are you staring at, you freak? - Thought you'd be prettier. - What the fuck does he mean? What the fuck do you mean? - Hey, hey, hey, Charlie. - You shitty smack-head asshole! What the fuck? Prick! - Well that went well. - No jokes. Be serious. - Yeah, yeah. - This is really sensitive. - I'm not an idiot. It's fine. - Hi, Mrs. Jenkins, I'm Jess Stands. - I'm Raz Scott, and that's my girlfriend Charlie Miller. We're doing a documentary about cyber-bullying, and we saw an article online about your daughter Clara. - Would you mind if we ask you some questions about that? Thank you. - Yeah, great, thanks. Did she mention any names before she left on Friday? - What sort of names? - Did she know a Rosy Clarke? - I don't think so. - What about a Seth Bridger, did she mention him? - No, who's he? - He's just someone that we've spoke to, about the girls disappearing. It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter? Of course it matters. Do you know where Clara is? - No, we're just making a film for college. - If you haven't got something to tell me, I think you should go. You shouldn't be here anyway, go on. Go, now. She was taking drugs. - Sorry, what? - Clara. She started taking drugs. Been so worried about her. She had this new boyfriend who got her into it. - What was his name? - I don't know, I didn't get that out of her. It's changed her, all this. - Do you have any idea where she might have gone? - I don't know. There was this place, near Whiton forest. Um, an old army barracks. She used to want to go, to take drugs with him. Followed them down there last week, and I had to drag her away. I don't think she forgave me. And now she's gone. - Thank you for seeing us. We'll show ourselves out. Look what Jess found. - Give it here. Wait, is that Bridger? - Yeah, with Clara Jenkins. - Right. Girls, from now on we film everything okay? You listening? - Isn't it a bit much, shouldn't we just stop now? - No, we can't just stop. Once we've cut this together, it's gonna be fuckin' amazing, Charlie. You guys in? - Well I dunno, look, what else do we need to get? - Right. - Where you going? - Fuck's sake! - It's just a bird, it's just a bird, chill out man.

Come on, think about it. - Well 'cause we heard her screaming. What's wrong with you? - No-one's down here. - Shut up, Clara? Clara? - Jesus. - Shit. - Oh fuck. - Hey, you alright mate? Hello? Hello, mate? - Leave him, Raz. - Mate? Do you know Clara Jenkins? Mate, do you know Seth Bridger? - You do know him. Did he come here with some girls? A Rosy or a Clara? - It's Raz. Raz, we need to get out of here. - I dunno how, I dunno how. Can we go the way we came back in? - No. - Oh, we can just go back the way that we walk. - I don't know the way we came in. - Fuck. Charlie? Shush yeah? I'm just thinking. You remember how we came in? - She's terrified Raz. - Yeah, we haven't got time for that, have we? - Shh. - If we just try and retrace our steps. - Charlie, shush, shush, shush. - I dunno how, I dunno how. The corridors here just go down. - Oh for fucks sake, Raz. Do you have any ideas? - No. Surprisingly enough, I don't. - Maybe let's just try it, and get the fuck out of here. Think, a way, hang on. - What? - This isn't right. - Oh for fucks sake, let's just keep going. It's a fucking labyrinth, we're gonna find a way out eventually. - Ohhh, shit. - Fuck. - Was it right or was it left here? - Left? I dunno-- - No, we've just, we've literally just fucking come from here a minute ago. - No we haven't, it just looks the same, just, Charlie, it looks the fuckin' same-- - You alright, Seth? What do you want? - Fuck. What the fuck are you doing, just fuck off, are you fucking nuts? - Charlie? Charlie I'm here, hold my hand. It's okay. Charlie? - Raz will you please turn that off? - I can't, babe. - Raz, we need to go home. Look at her. - Oh, god. - It's okay. It's okay. - Why the fuck did he keep pointing at me? - I dunno. - I haven't even done anything, it really freaked me out. - Charlie, he's a creep, okay. He's just doing what creeps do, stop thinking about it. - Raz, where's your car? - It's just down here. - Maybe we should just go to the police. - About what? And tell 'em about what, Jess? That a man in a scary mask pointed at my girlfriend? - Yes, Raz, that'll do it. - Yeah well I guarantee you they'll take the piss. - Well where are we going now? - Look, I told you, just down here. Right, well there you go. Utter fucking wankers, man. - They said they'd go round there, Raz. What's wrong with you? - Did you see their faces, Jess? They were taking the piss. - Just leave it, Raz. - Just leave it? Jesus fucking christ, Jess. - I'm going back to Bridger's. - Oh no fucking way. Forget it. - No, Jess. - I'm done with this. - Jess, I'm gonna go back to Bridger's, and we're gonna-- - No, Raz, you listen to me. I'm done with this, okay? I'm going home. I'll talk to Kallis about it in the morning. Make sure you take Charlie home. - Yep. - Alright, Charlie, text me when you get home. - Oh yeah, and you can tell four-stripes that this is gonna be the best film he's ever fuckin' seen. Look, I know you're shitting yourself, Charlie, but I honestly think we should go back to his flat. You know, I just want him to know that we're not scared of him. - But we are, Raz. - Yeah, I know that we are, but at the end of the day, it wasn't me that he was pointing at though, is it? - Yeah, I fucking know that. - Yeah, exactly Charlie, so you don't wanna just go back to his flat, and we tear him a new one, that lanky, streak of piss. Yeah? Charlie I know you wanna go back there. Come on. - Yeah. Yeah, alright, yeah, fuck him! - That's what I'm talking about. - Oi! You know, we've called the police, you know. They know about earlier. - Charlie, a bit quieter, jesus. - Why don't you come out here without your fucking mask on, you bell-end. - Charlie, he's not gonna come out now, is he? Fuck. Oh shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, well this is definitely breaking and entering. Great, of course. Lights are broken, obviously. - Shh, shut the fuck-- - Alright, alright, alright, yeah. Fuckin' hell. Jesus. Oh fucking hell. Jesus. What the fuck? Charlie? - Fuckin' hell. - Fuck, what the fuck? - Jesus. - You scared the shit out of me. - What are you doing? - What the fuck's in there? Jesus, this bloke is fucked up. - Yeah he's a classic nutcase. Come on, let's go. - Should we call the police? - Yeah, come on. Charlie? Fucking weirdo. - Charlie, come on. Shit. Oh my god. - Phew, jesus christ. Where are they? - Dunno. Do we have to wait? I'm fucking freezing. - Do you reckon they're coming? - You told them about the pictures, yeah? - Mhmm, yeah but you saw their faces, eh? They're assholes. Well that's weird. It's Jess. It's a video message. - Let me see. I'm at the barracks. You can save me, Charlie. Please save me, Charlie. Call my sister, warn her to-- - What the fuck, Raz?! - Charlie, charlie. Take the camera, take the camera, take the camera. - Jess?! Jess?! - Bridger, are you here? - Jess?! Bridger? - Jess? Oh fucking hell. Jess? - Jess?! Jess?! Jess, please! - Jess?! - Please Jess, just shout out. Jess?! Jess? - Jess? - Jess? Jess?! I can't, I can't, I can't. - Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. - I can't go down there, I don't want to go down there. - Charlie? Look at me. Look, we're gonna go in there, and we're gonna get Jess, 'cause we have to, okay? We're gonna get those two girls, and more importantly, you're gonna be okay. Alright? Look at me. Do you know why we're gonna be okay? 'Cause I've got you. You'll say Raz, you're the best boyfriend in the world, and you've got me, and nothing's ever gonna happen to me. Okay? - Raz, you're a dick. - That's good enough for me. Now just stay close, yeah? - Don't leave me, please. - Keep calling, babe. - Jess? Jess? Jess? - Charlie! - She's here! - Charlie! - Jess, babe?! - Charlie! - Are you alright? - I'm fine. - Who's this? - This is Clara Jenkins. - Rosy? - No. - Shh. Guys, guys come on, let's go. Come on. Fuck. Who the hell shut the fucking door? - What do you, fuck, how is supposed to be-- - Well it wasn't fucking closed 30 seconds ago, was it Charlie? Oh what, are you gonna use that, then? Mate I've got you all on film, mate. - Let me out! - Charlie! - Charlie! Charlie? Charlie? Charlie? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Charlie, oh shit. Charlie?! Charlie, say something! Charlie, babe, Charlie. Charlie? Charlie, just say something, please! Charlie! Oh, fucking hell! The fucker. Charlie! - I'm Jess Stands, and this is Clara Jenkins. What happened here? Why does he want Charlie? - He needs virgins. Is she a virgin, that girl? - Yeah? I think so. Why? - He wants them fresh. Untouched. - But why are you still here? - I was a mistake. - What do you mean, mistake? - I'm not a virgin. I'm pregnant, and apparently, that would be wrong. - And did Seth Bridger bring you here? - This is fucked up. I really fucked up. - Jess! Jess! Jess, please, where are you? Jess! Jess! Jess, please! Please don't be dead, Jess, please! Jess! What the fuck? Oh jesus Christ. Jess? Fuckin' hell. Oh, Jess. Seth. Can't we sort this out, mate?
