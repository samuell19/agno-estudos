CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT Girl: WE'RE ALL CAPABLE OF DOING BAD THINGS. LORD KNOWS, I'VE DONE MY SHARE, THINGS I'M TRULY ASHAMED OF. BUT SHOULD MY LIFE, SO YOUNG AND FULL OF SWEET PROMISE, BE TRAGICALLY CUT DOWN BEFORE IT EVER HAD A CHANCE TO SHINE? [VOMITS] IF I EVER GET OUT OF HERE, AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, SOMEBODY'S GONNA PAY. OR AS THE GREAT GERMAN PHILOSOPHER FRED NIETZSCHE ONCE SAID, THAT WHICH DOES NOT KILL US IS GONNA WISH IT HAD, BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO FED-EX ITS SORRY ASS BACK TO SKANK CENTRAL, WHERE IT CAME FROM... OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MY DADDY ALWAYS SAYS EVERYTHING IS BIGGER HERE IN TEXAS, EVEN THE SKY. I DON'T KNOW HOW TRUE THAT IS, SINCE I'VE NEVER BEEN OVER THE STATE LINE. [COWS MOOING] I DO KNOW THAT THE LONE STAR STATE HAS PRODUCED LOTS OF FAMOUS PEOPLE. JOHN WAYNE IS FROM TEXAS; ALSO PRESIDENTS EISENHOWER, JOHNSON, BUSH, AND BUSH; ANN RICHARDS, WHO'S A DEMOCRAT BUT A REALLY COOL PERSON; THE MARY KAY OF MARY KAY COSMETICS; AND ONE DAY SOON, ME. I DECIDED AT AGE 3, I WAS GONNA JOIN THE RANKS OF THESE ILLUSTRIOUS TEXANS, NO MATTER WHAT IT TOOK. I WAS GONNA BE A TV STAR. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING-- WHY WOULD SOME SUPREMELY SMART GIRL LIKE ME WANT TO BE JUST A TV STAR? THE ANSWER-- GOOD MORNING, AMERICA. WHAT COULD BE MORE SATISFYING AND REWARDING THAN KNOWING THAT, EVERY MORNING, IT'S YOU WHO WAKES UP THIS GREAT AMERICAN NATION WITH A SMILE? I NEVER DOUBTED I'D MAKE IT IF I FOLLOWED THE PATH TO THE TOP FOOTSTEP BY FOOTSTEP, AND TONIGHT WAS A VERY CRUCIAL FOOTSTEP. STARLA, WE DON'T WANT TO BE LATE, DARLING. I'M READY. OH, ALL EYES ARE GONNA BE ON MY LITTLE GIRL. OH, DADDY, PLEASE. ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN, CUPCAKE, BEFORE TIME AND GRAVITY DO THEIR DIRTY WORK. YOU JUST LOOK BEAUTIFUL, DARLING.

HONEY, IN HER LETTERS, THAT LITTLE GIRL JUST SOUNDS SO SWEET, AND SHE WANTS TO COME HERE SO BADLY. MAMA'S ONLY THINKING ABOUT YOU, HONEY. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO FAIL FRENCH. I KNOW. I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE ENTERTAINING SOME FOREIGNER. AND BESIDES, WE PULLED THEIR UNGRATEFUL FRENCH BUTTS OUT OF 2 WORLD WARS. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? NOW, STARLA, I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER-- THERE'S NO SHAME IN NOT WINNING THE BEAUTY PAGEANT. IT'S NOT A BEAUTY PAGEANT. IT'S A CELEBRATION OF ALL THAT IT MEANS TO BE A MODERN WOMAN-- CHARM, CLASS, AND SOPHISTICATION.

LAST SUMMER, I FELL IN LOVE WITH A BOY FROM MARSEILLES-- JEAN-MARIE. JEAN-MARIE WAS A GYPSY, AND HE HAD THE SOUL OF A POET. BY DAY, WE WOULD RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS OF LILAC, AND AT NIGHT, HE WOULD CARESS MY FACE UNDER THE FRENCH MOON. OOH LA LA. OUR LOVE WAS PURE, BUT PAPA, HE HATED JEAN-MARIE. YOU SEE, I HAD CARED FOR PAPA EVER SINCE MY MOTHER DIED IN A BOATING ACCIDENT, AND HE WAS TERRIFIED I WOULD RUN AWAY. MON DIEU. THEN ONE FATEFUL NIGHT, BOOM! PAPA'S POOR HEART ATTACKED HIM, AND I'M THE ORPHAN. OH... JEAN-MARIE CAME TO PAPA'S FUNERAL AND VOWED HIS UNDYING LOVE FOR ME. WE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE VERY NEXT DAY BY TRAIN FOR THE RIVIERA, WHERE HE WOULD JOIN THE CIRQUE D'OR AS A JUGGLER, AND I... I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO BEAR HIS CHILDREN AND WASH HIS LEOTARDS. WE DECIDED TO MEET THE NEXT DAY AT THE STATION. WHAT HAPPENED? I WAIT, AND I WAIT. DAY TURNED TO NIGHT. AND STILL NO JEAN-MARIE. OH. OH. IT WAS ONLY LATER I LEARNED THAT ON HIS WAY TO MEET ME, HE MUST HAVE BEEN SO EXCITED, BECAUSE HE DROVE TOO FAST AND FLEW OFF HIS MOTORCYCLE INTO THE SEINE AND DROWNED. THAT IS SO... EUROPEAN. DON'T CRY FOR ME. IN FRANCE, WE ARE TOLD THAT SADNESS AND JOY ARE SISTERS HOLDING HANDS, EACH ONE LOST WITHOUT THE OTHER. OUI. OUI. AND THEN THAT GORGEOUS, ROMANTIC JEAN-MARIE WAS THROWN OFF HIS MOTORCYCLE AND DROWNED IN THE SEINE. RIGHT? GOD, Y'ALL, THAT IS TOTALLY TITANIC. HEY, TITANIC WAS A MOVIE. WHAT HAPPENED TO GENEVIEVE WAS REAL. EXCUSE ME. BEFORE TITANIC WAS A MOVIE, IT WAS REAL. DUH! FEAST YOUR EYES, LADIES. LET ME SEE. LET ME SEE. WHOA. Starla: WHERE AM I? AND, GENEVIEVE, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? I WANT TO DO A WHOLE PAGE ON GENEVIEVE. NO. I COULD NOT POSSIBLY. OH, BUT YOU HAVE TO! THEN YOU CAN TELL YOUR WHOLE SAD SOB STORY. Ashley: OUI. PEOPLE WILL FEEL REAL SORRY FOR YOU, AND YOU'LL GET LOTS OF DATES. BUT THIS ARTICLE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT ME... WELCOMING GENEVIEVE, AND I THINK AN ARTICLE ON YOU IS A GREAT IDEA.

WHO CARES IF YOU CAN SPEAK A LANGUAGE THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO HOCK A LUGIE? IS THAT REALLY GONNA SERVE YOU BETTER IN THE REAL WORLD THAN BEING ABLE TO KICK YOUR HEELS OVER YOUR HEAD? HEY, YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR, MISS SPRINKLE. CAN'T YOU TEMPORARILY PUT ONE OF THE GIRLS INTO MY SPOT? THAT WOULD JUST CREATE AN EMPTY SPACE SOMEWHERE ELSE. THERE'S A VERY DELICATE BALANCE HERE. 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4... UH... THIS IS A CRAZY IDEA, I KNOW, BUT PERHAPS I COULD STEP IN FOR STARLA, JUST UNTIL SHE GETS HER GRADES UP. YOU REPLACE ME?

JE T'EN SUPPLIE. PARDONNEZ-MOI. I DON'T SPEAK FRENCH! STARLA, WAIT. I HAVE DONE DESPICABLE THINGS, BUT ONLY BECAUSE I WAS DAZZLED BY THE BEAUTY OF YOUR LIFE. PLEASE DO NOT KISS MY KNEES. THAT IS JUST TOO SQUIRRELY FOR WORDS. I AM MALICE AFORETHOUGHT, THE DAUGHTER OF EVIL, THE WHORE OF BABYLON. I KNOW YOU COULD NEVER FORGIVE ME, BUT AT LEAST LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN. EXPLAIN WHAT?! NOT LONG AGO, I HAD A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY MYSELF. AND THEN PIECE BY PIECE, MY LIFE FELL APART LIKE A DRY CROISSANT. BUT THEN I CAME HERE, AND YOU OPENED UP YOUR LIMBS AND WELCOMED ME TO YOUR FAMILY'S WARM BOSOM, AND LET ME INTO YOUR WORLD. AND THEN, POOF... THANKS TO YOU, I HAD A NEW FAMILY. I ADMIRED YOU SO MUCH. I ADORED YOU. AND THEN... AND THEN I WANTED TO BE YOU. YOUR LIFE IS LIKE A FAIRY TALE. YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO SOPHISTIQUE AND SO CHARMANTE-- EVERYTHING I WASN'T. I BECAME OBSESSED. I WAS SO JEALOUS OF YOU. YOU POOR THING. IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD. I TRIED TO TAKE YOUR FAMILY AWAY. HOW CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? I ALMOST FEEL GUILTY MY LIFE WAS SO PERFECT. NO WONDER YOU WERE JEALOUS. DON'T BLAME YOURSELF. IT IS NOT YOU WHO SHOULD FEEL GUILTY. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS STRANGE, BUT... IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU TOTALLY MESSING UP MY LIFE, I WOULD HAVE NEVER REALIZED WHAT IT'S LIKE TO NOT BE THE BEST. AND HEY, WHO KNOWS? MAYBE IT'LL MAKE ME AN EVEN BETTER PERSON. I WILL MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT. I SWEAR IT, ON THE GRAVES OF MON PäRE AND MY BELOVED JEAN-MARIE. I MUST, OR I WILL LOSE MY SOUL. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO EXTINGUISH MY GUILT. I MUST COME CLEANLY. THE TAPE. OH, STARLA, THAT OUTFIT SUITS YOU SO WELL. I'M SO HAPPY THAT WE ARE FRIENDS ONCE AGAIN. [KISS KISS] ME, TOO. BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST. LET'S HURRY UP. WE DON'T WANT TO BE LATE FOR FRENCH CLASS. DON'T WORRY. AFTER MY CONFESSION, YOU WILL ONCE MORE BE THE PRINCESS OF SPLENDONA HIGH. TRUST ME. I WILL MAKE SURE EVERYONE WILL KNOW THE TRUTH. OH, LET ME DO THAT. I'M JUST SO HAPPY TO GET MY LIFE BACK. HEY, STARLA, GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK. I LOVE YOUR SHOES! HOWDY, Y'ALL. BEAUTIFUL DAY. [VOICES ECHOING] UH... HIYA. CAN'T IT WAIT? WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH HER? IT'S LIKE A MIRACLE. SHE TURNED OVER THE TAPE, AND SHE'S GONNA CONFESS EVERYTHING. ARE YOU OK? SURE. I NEVER FELT BETTER. SHE WENT THROUGH THIS WHOLE CATHOLIC THING-- KISSING MY KNEES AND CALLING HERSELF A WHORE. IT WAS LIKE TAXICAB CONFESSIONS. WE'RE GONNA GET EVERYTHING STRAIGHTENED AWAY. I'LL BE HEAD HORNETTE AGAIN. KYLE AND I WILL GET BACK TOGETHER. I'LL BE A LOCK FOR THE JUNIOR ANCHORPERSONS COMPETITION. YOU'D TAKE KYLE BACK? WELL, YEAH. WHAT? NOTHING. HOPE IT ALL WORKS OUT. YOU DESERVE IT. FREAK. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? I HAVE NO IDEA. [DISTORTED VOICES] WOW. [MONSIEUR DUKE SPEAKING FRENCH] YOUNG LADY, YOU ARE NO LONGER A MEMBER OF MY CLASS.

TELL THEM WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. PLAY THIS TAPE. STARLA, I WON'T HAVE YOU DISRUPTING THIS CLASS. MONSIEUR DUKE, SOME THINGS ARE A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT THAN FRENCH CLASS. IN FACT... MOST THINGS ARE. HA HA HA! PLAY THIS TAPE! NOW! IMMéDIATEMENT. ANDELE. Genevieve: PLEASE, DO AS SHE SAYS. PLAY THE TAPE, I BEG YOU. Starla's voice: THE WHOLE SCHOOL IS NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF PHONY POSERS, A NEST OF USERS, LOSERS, AND SELF-ABUSERS. ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT TAPE. I THINK WE'D ALL LIKE TO HEAR THE REST. [SCREAMING] STARLA! Starla's voice: DON'T GET ME STARTED ON MONSIEUR LE DUKE, MR. "I'M MARRIED, BUT TEENAGE GIRLS MAKE MY POP MY JIMMY IN MY FRUIT DE LOOMS." AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. I HEARD THAT ON THE WEEKENDS, HE AND HIS WIFE MARILYN GET TOGETHER WITH THE NEIGHBORS, AND THEY TAKE OFF ALL THEIR CLOTHES, AND THEY-- THAT'LL BE ENOUGH OF THAT. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! SHE SWITCHED THE TAPES! AND I SUPPOSE THAT WASN'T YOUR VOICE WE WERE HEARING? AAH! [SCREAMING] [SHOUTING IN FRENCH] SHE'S GOT A KNIFE, AND SHE'S HIGH! YOU BITCH! [SCREAMING] SECURITé! SECURITé! [SCREAMING CONTINUES] [DOOR OPENS] COME WITH ME. [VOMITS] OH, MY. COME ON. HA HA HA... COME ON. IF THESE TURN OUT GOOD, COULD I ORDER PRINTS?

WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOUR CALL EVER SINCE THE SCHOOL PHONED US ABOUT OUR STARLA. THEN YOU KNOW SHE'S PROBABLY IN A SPOT OF TROUBLE? YOU MIGHT WANT TO COME DOWN HERE AND PICK HER UP. WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, OFFICER, I TALKED IT OVER WITH MY HUSBAND, ARNIE, AND WE BOTH FEEL A LITTLE TOUGH LOVE MIGHT BE IN ORDER. WOULD IT BE OK WITH YOU, DARLING, IF WE JUST SORT OF LET STARLA COOL HER HEELS IN THE SLAMMER FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS? WOULD IT BE OK? WELL, HELL, YEAH. VERY GOOD, THEN. THANK YOU, SHERIFF FLINK... MAN. BYE. AT LAST... A PARENT WHO CARES. WHO WAS THAT? STARLA. SHE CALLED TO SAY SHE'D BE WORKING ALL NIGHT WITH ED, REHEARSING HER NEWS PIECE FOR THE COMPETITION, AND SHE'LL MEET US THERE TOMORROW. OH. OK. AM I GETTING OUT OF HERE? I'M SORRY, HONEY. NOT YET. BUT WE'RE GONNA LET YOU GET ALL CLEANED UP. JUST BEING IN HERE MAKES ME FEEL DIRTY. TO BE HONEST, I COULD USE A NICE, HOT BATH. ARE YOU TELLING ME NONE OF Y'ALL HAS GOT ANY CREAM RINSE? DEAR GOD... I PROMISE, IF YOU LET ME OUT OF HERE, TO BECOME A SWEETER... MORE CARING AND CONSIDERATE PERSON. THANK YOU, GOD, FOR GIVING ME THIS CELL ALL TO MYSELF. I TAKE THAT AS A SIGN. [DOOR OPENS] [SNORING] [WOMAN FARTING] UGH! [DOOR OPENS] NOW WHAT? YOU ARE FREE, DARLING. OH! WHERE'S MOM AND DAD? GENEVIEVE TOLD THEM THAT YOU'D MEET THEM AT THE JUNIOR ANCHORPERSON COMPETITION. SO THEY LET ME ROT IN PRISON? WELL, THEY DIDN'T REALLY KNOW. WELL, THEN WHO BAILED ME OUT? I DID. YOU? HOW? I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED THIS. ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOUR BROKE YOUR PIGGY BANK FOR ME? YEAH. WELL, SOMEBODY HAD TO DO SOMETHING. WHY? YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE ME. NOBODY FUCKS WITH MY FAMILY AND GETS AWAY WITH IT. NOW LET'S GO. WHERE ARE WE GOING? TO THE CAR. YOU DON'T HAVE A CAR. SOMEONE ELSE DOES. [SIGHS] IF YOU'RE HERE TO TELL ME WHAT A JERK I AM, TAKE A NUMBER. NO, BUT BEFORE WE MOVE ON, I HAVE TO SAY... YOU WERE MONUMENTALLY CRUEL TO ME. I KNOW. BUT CAN WE PLEASE HURRY? BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MISS THE COMPETITION. THERE'S A PIECE OF INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW. UH... THIS CAME IN YOUR E-MAIL. I THINK YOU MIGHT LIKE TO READ IT. "GENEVIEVE LePLOUFF WAS A STUDENT AT OUR SCHOOL "WHO GRADUATED IN 1939. "YOU'LL FIND HER GRAVE AT THE CEMETERY IN PARIS, "JUST 3 HEADSTONES BEHIND JIM MORRISON AND 2 HEADSTONES TO THE RIGHT OF BALZAC." WHAT?! WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS GIRL, ANYWAY? I DIDN'T FIND HER! SHE FOUND ME! WHO IS SHE? THERE'S MORE. SPIT IT OUT! SORRY. WHAT IS IT? I THINK LA FIEND IS TRYING TO STEAL YOUR PLACE IN THE COMPETITION. I OVERHEARD HER PRACTICING YOUR PIECE. WHAT?! THAT COW IS INCREDIBLE! SHE'S AN ICE-COLD PRO. YEAH? WELL, I'M GONNA KICK HER ICE-COLD ASS! WHAT? "KICK HER ICE-COLD ASS." ICE... COW... ASS. ICE COW ASS! ICE COW ASS! COME ON! TAKE ME HOME! Man: WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO THE K.E.H.A. STUDIOS JUNIOR ANCHORPERSONS COMPETITION. THE WINNER OF THE JUNIOR ANCHORPERSONS COMPETITION WILL BE AWARDED A SCHOLARSHIP TO STUDY BROADCASTING AT WELLESLEY COLLEGE, AND WHO KNOWS, THE BIG CHANCE TO REACH FAME AND FORTUNE. OUR FIRST CONTESTANT IS SUSAN DOUGLAS FROM THOMPKINS HIGH WITH "MULCH, THE GARDENER'S FRIEND." Girl: MY NAME IS SUSAN DOUGLAS, AND MY STORY TONIGHT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WORLD NEEDS MULCH. [TIRES SCREECH] [TIRES SCREECH] YES! WHERE IS STARLA? MAMAN, I HAVE BEEN THINKING. THE IMPORTANT THING IS FOR THE SHOW TO GO ON. I WILL FILL IN FOR STARLA IF SHE'S NOT HERE IN TIME. CAN YOU DO THAT? OUI, PAPA. I HAVE GIVEN THE JUDGES A GOOD TALKING-TO. I THINK IT'S WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED. [TIRES SCREECH] I'M GONNA PUT A 2-SECOND DISSOLVE IN HERE, OK? YEAH. WHATEVER. [TYPING] Thomas: NEXT UP, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WILL BE DOREEN GILMORE OF SPLENDONA HIGH WITH "COLOR-BLIND." [BLEATING AND HISSING] [HORSE NEIGHS] TONIGHT, I'M GONNA INTRODUCE YOU TO THE HASKEL FAMILY-- JAMES, LERLENE, AND THEIR 7-YEAR-OLD SON RONNY. RONNY HASN'T SEEN MUCH TRAGEDY OR PAIN IN HIS YOUNG LIFE, BUT AS YOU'LL DISCOVER TONIGHT, IT'S WHAT HE DOESN'T SEE THAT TRULY HURTS. Doreen's voice: HE WAS LIKE ANY CHILD, FULL OF LIFE AND LAUGHTER, BUT EARLY ON, LERLENE NOTICED HER SON WAS NOT LIKE ANY CHILD. RONNY WAS HELPING ME SET THE TABLE FOR DINNER, AND I SAID, "RONNY, BRING MAMA THE KETCHUP." AND HE SAID, "WHICH ONE'S THAT?" AND I SAID, "THE RED ONE, DARLING." [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] HE BROUGHT ME THE MUSTARD. [AUDIENCE GROANS] Doreen's voice: THE DIAGNOSIS WAS HORRIFYING. LITTLE RONNY WAS COLOR-BLIND. LITTLE RONNY'S OLDER BROTHER, AS WELL AS HIS FATHER, HAD BEEN VERY UPSET BY LERLENE'S REACTION... [VOICE FADES] THIS IS IT. I'D BETTER HURRY AND DELIVER THIS TAPE. WAIT. I MEAN... I'VE WANTED TO BE AN ANCHORPERSON MY WHOLE LIFE. WHAT IF I'M NO GOOD? WHAT IF I FAIL? [SIGHS] WHAT IF THE BEST I CAN DO... IS CABLE? WHAT? DO I HAVE SOMETHING ON MY FACE? YOU JUST MAKE ME LAUGH, THAT'S ALL. GO GET 'EM, CABLE GIRL. WELL, AS NIETZSCHE SAYS, THAT WHICH DOES NOT KILL US ONLY MAKES US STRONGER. THANKS... I THINK. [SIGHS] Doreen: THAT IS A QUESTION FOR THE EXPERTS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY TO Y'ALL LITTLE RONNY IS SO YOUNG... SO YOUNG. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF GOD DOES THIS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] DUDE, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN HERE. ...A SUBSTITUTION IN THE ENTRIES. TAKING THE PLACE OF STARLA GRADY WILL BE GENEVIEVE LePLOUFF. [APPLAUSE] YOU GOT THE WRONG TAPE FOR STARLA GRADY. THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE. Thomas: GENEVIEVE LePLOUFF, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WITH "MISSING GIRL." [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] THANKS, MAN. TONIGHT, I'M STANDING IN FOR STARLA GRADY, WHO HAS SHOWN ME SO MUCH LOVE. IT PAINS ME TO REPORT THAT STARLA COULD NOT BE HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE SHE HAS SUFFERED A TEMPORARY SETBACK IN HER ONGOING BATTLE WITH... DRUG ADDICTION. WHAT? TODAY SHE'S IN PRISON, STRUNG-OUT AND DISGRACED, HER ONCE-PROUD REPUTATION IN TATTERS. IT SEEMS THAT STARLA HAS HAD A DOUBLE IDENTITY. SHE DECEIVED HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY BUT UNFORTUNATELY, COULD NOT DECEIVE HERSELF. HOW DID SHE PAY FOR THIS ADDICTION? I WILL SIMPLY SAY THAT PROSTITUTION IS ONE OF THE MOST ANCIENT FORMS OF COMMERCE. [AUDIENCE GASPS] WHAT?! GIVE ME STRENGTH. MY SUBJECT IS THE TRAGEDY OF MISSING CHILDREN. TONIGHT I'LL TELL YOU THE HEARTBREAKING STORY OF ONE LITTLE GIRL WHO HAS BEEN MISSING FOR TOO LONG. VIDEO, PLEASE. TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THIS MISSING GIRL. HONEY. IT'S GENEVIEVE LePLOUFF, THE FRENCH EXCHANGE STUDENT WE HAVE ALL COME TO KNOW AND LOVE. RIGHT? OR IS SHE SOMEONE ELSE? [AUDIENCE GASPS] LOOK AGAIN. MANY OF YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE THIS LITTLE MISS OF A GIRL. IT'S CLARISSA FOGELSEY, FORMERLY OF SPLENDONA, TEXAS. [AUDIENCE GASPS] OH, MY GOD! YEAH, YOU GO, GIRL. [AUDIENCE TALKING EXCITEDLY] ISN'T THAT RIGHT, CLARISSA? [TEXAS ACCENT] OH, YOU ARE SUCH A LOSER BITCH! [AUDIENCE GASPS] OK, THAT IS NOT FRENCH. THAT'S NOT EVEN EUROPEAN. DAMN YOU, STARLA GRADY! FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT NOT REMEMBER CLARISSA, THIS CLIP COURTESY OF THE ARCHIVES OF MY FATHER, MR. ARNOLD GRADY, MIGHT REFRESH YOUR MEMORY. [MUSIC PLAYING] Starla: IT WAS IN THIRD GRADE, AT THE HARVEST FESTIVAL, WHEN LITTLE CLARISSA HAD A MOST UNFORTUNATE ENCOUNTER WITH THE ICE COW. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I REMEMBER THAT. HA HA HA! WHATEVER HAPPENED TO CLARISSA AFTER SHE WAS CAUGHT KISSING THE ICE COW'S ASS? [LAUGHTER CONTINUES] NOW WE KNOW THE TRUTH. CLARISSA'S FAMILY MOVED TO FRANCE. SURELY SOME OF YOU REMEMBER. ONE DAY, FOR SOME REASON, SHE CREATED GENEVIEVE LePLOUFF AND RETURNED TO SPLENDONA, WHERE ME AND MY FAMILY UNKNOWINGLY TOOK HER IN, GAVE HER LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING. AND WHAT DID SHE DO? SHE WAGED A SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ME. HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME? YES, IT'S TRUE. I ADMIT IT. I WANTED TO RUIN YOUR LIFE, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE YOU RUINED MINE! SEE? YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER, DO YOU? IT WAS YOU WHO TOLD ME TO KISS THAT ICE COW'S ASS FOR GOOD LUCK, AND I FELL FOR IT! [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] IS THAT SO FUNNY? EVEN AFTER MY FAMILY MOVED AWAY, THE PAIN REMAINED! DON'T YOU SEE? SHE RUINED MY LIFE! I'M THE VICTIM HERE. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Girl: GET OVER IT! NO, NO. SHE'S RIGHT. [SIGHS] I... STARLA GRADY... TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLARISSA'S PAIN. CLARISSA, I'M SORRY. COME ON, SPLENDONA. HELP ME EMBRACE CLARISSA AND LET HER KNOW THAT HER LONG NIGHTMARE IS OVER. WELCOME HOME, CLARISSA! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AMAZING. SHE'S EVEN LOCKED THIS ONE UP. YOU MANIPULATIVE BRAT. YOU USED ME AGAIN. LOOK AT YOU, SO SELF-RIGHTEOUS, SO PERFECT. YOU'RE A BIGGER FAKE THAN I COULD EVER BE. WHY, CLARISSA, WHATEVER ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW GODDAMN WELL WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! YOU HUMILIATED ME IN FRONT OF THIS PIECE OF CRAP TOWN ALL OVER AGAIN JUST TO WIN SOME STUPID COMPETITION! [AUDIENCE GROANS] WE'RE JUST ALIKE, YOU AND ME. WE BOTH CREATED OURSELVES, AND WE BOTH USE OTHER PEOPLE AS A MEANS TO GET WHAT WE WANT. YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS WERE A BAD LOSER! OH, I HATE YOU. I HATE YOU AND THIS TOWN AND ALL THE PATHETIC INBREDS THAT LIVE HERE! [AUDIENCE GASPS] SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT ME, BUT DON'T MESS WITH SPLENDONA! OH! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] STARLA. STARLA! STARLA! STARLA! STARLA. I WAS A JERK. I WAS A COMPLETE JERK. I WAS SEDUCED BY LA FIEND. BUT IT'S YOU WHO I LOVE. HOW CAN I MAKE IT UP TO YOU? [SIGHS] KYLE... OH... KYLE... BEAUTIFUL KYLE... OH, THANK YOU, BABY. DO I HAVE THE WORD "DOORMAT" STAMPED ACROSS MY FOREHEAD, YOU ENORMOUS BONEHEAD?! YOU ARE SO FIRED AS MY BOYFRIEND! UH! [WHIMPERING] SLAPPING PEOPLE IS FUN. ED. Thomas: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? THE JUDGES HAVE COMPLETED THEIR DELIBERATIONS. Arnie: BABY. COME HERE. COME ON. HONEY, COME ON. WHAT WE SAW HERE TODAY WERE, IN PARTS, TRULY UNUSUAL PRESENTATIONS. BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE DECISION WAS COMPLETELY UNANIMOUS. ALL RIGHT, LET'S START... ED! ED! HEY! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU KNOW, I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING. THIS IS YOUR WORLD. THERE'S NO PLACE FOR ME. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? STARLA, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK IN AND RECEIVE YOUR AWARD? YOU WORKED SO HARD FOR IT. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE COMPETITION ANYMORE. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THE STARLA I KNOW. WELL... PEOPLE CAN CHANGE. Thomas: AND NOW, THE WINNER OF THE JUNIOR ANCHORPERSONS AWARD AND THE RECIPIENT OF A FULL SCHOLARSHIP TO STUDY BROADCASTING AT WELLESLEY COLLEGE IS... DOREEN GILMORE FOR "COLOR-BLIND." WHAT?! COME ON UP HERE, DOREEN. THAT SNEAKY PSEUDO-SENTIMENTAL FAKE IS STEALING MY SHOW?! I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER... DOES IT? YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT THE HELL? I'M SPEECHLESS. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH OUT THERE. THIS MEANS A LOT TO ME. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. Starla: NEXT FALL, I'M GOING TO WELLESLEY COLLEGE, WITHOUT A SCHOLARSHIP. I MEAN, IF DOREEN GILMORE THINKS SHE CAN KEEP ME FROM SITTING ON A COUCH WITH KATIE COURIC, SHE'S GOT ANOTHER THING COMING. I KNOW. I KNOW. THERE'S ROOM FOR EVERYONE. I TOLD RANDOLPH THAT I WAS A VEGETARIAN. HE WAS SURPRISINGLY ACCEPTING. HE TOLD ME THAT HE'D BEEN PUTTING BLANKS IN DADDY'S GUNS FOR YEARS. THAT WAS A NICE MOMENT. [COWS MOOING] IT'S COOL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU STOP BEING WHO YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AND START BEING WHO YOU REALLY ARE. I MEAN, WHO EVER THOUGHT A BLUE-EYED GEEK FROM UPSTATE NEW YORK NAMED EDWIN WOULD BE THE FIRST PERSON TO TAKE ME OVER THE STATE LINE? STARLA?
