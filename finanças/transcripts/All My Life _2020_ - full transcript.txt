Subtitles by explosiveskull [woman] The average person lives 27,375 days. That's all we get, if we're lucky. 27,375. At first, I thought it didn't really seem like a lot of time. But then again, how many days do we really remember anyway? Most days pass by unnoticed, unremarkable, unmarked. Because we only remember the days when we feel something happened. Something beautiful or tragic. Most days will pass in a blur. So many of mine did. They were lost in routine or school or both. I didn't notice my life was becoming a series of forgotten days. - Ugly. - Yeah. Everything was being saved for later. You made that money, honey. Live spontaneously, later. [horn honks] - Dude! - Travel, later. - Amanda! - Find love, later. - [horn honks] - Sorry, sorry. But everything can change in a day. If you kill my friends, I kill you. And what might be missing... becomes so very clear. [rock music playing over speakers] This place has, like, three stars on Yelp. [customers shouting, cheering] Oh, really? Just one drink and then we'll go to dinner. - I swear. - I'm gonna go pee. I'll grab a table. - Get beer. - [man 1] He's doing it! [man 2] Ah! Whoo! [man 3] No. [woman] How did we end up at a sports bar today? I'm sorry. I get that I'm giving you PTSD from your time at Ruck's. Stop. You were the best worst bartender that I had ever seen. Gosh. There's always a line. Jeez. - I know. - No matter where you go. Yum. I would like to propose a toast to the beautiful, brilliant, wildly talented, recently promoted Amanda. - Cheers. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. And to getting an assistant. - There you go! - [chattering, shouting] - Oh, incoming. - How you doing, ladies? Y'all look a little lonely. Keep you some company. Uh, there's three of us. I'm Dave. This is Kyle. Sol. I'm sorry... They're the lonely ones. I'm just embarrassed. Embarrassed for you or for them? For them right now. And me... very soon. [Kyle] All right. We're just gonna start over. We just wanted to come over and say hi. So, hi. - Hi. - Hi. I'ma tell y'all a story that's gonna change your life. - I... - [Kyle] No, no. We're gonna go. - You don't have to. - You don't have to... You do wanna hear the story. Listen, you wanna hear the... No, no, no. Now we have to hear the story. What kind of story? I'm gonna tell you ladies a story about the time I almost lost my pinkie toe. - Wait. - [Sol] Okay. I'm out. I'm gonna get you drinks and save myself the embarrassment. - [Kyle] I'll come with you. - No, you will not. You will stay right here, 'cause we telling this story together. - Yeah. - All right. I'm on the back of the moped, right? This guy right here, he's driving. All of a sudden, a squirrel just pops out of nowhere. At this point, the moped is grinding, like, up against the curb, and now my toe is pinned down, right? You know what? I am gonna go help your friend with the drinks. But, um, great story. Hey, where you... Especially when you do a takedown. You don't want them to come from under... So, who you guys rooting for? Baldy No Neck or Big Arm Chicken Legs? Um, baldy with no neck. He's the underdog. - Another Dave's Margarita? - [Sol] Yeah. Make it two. So, your friend's story... Oh, yeah. I'm... I apologize for that. He thinks it's a great icebreaker. It's actually not a bad idea, all things considered. It's playing the odds. How so? So, 99 out of 100 girls will hate that story. - Right? Hate it. - Mm-hmm. But if he can find that one, that one girl who loves a good smooshed baby toe story, she'll be floored. It's a soul-mate moment for her. If you believe in destiny and chance and meeting the right person, then it's worth the risk. He has the right idea. ...jumped off the trash can. - I still think it's the wrong idea. - Maybe. Okay, this stare is officially two seconds away from turning full creepazoid. - Yeah. Okay. - You should probably blink or look left. - Do something else with your eyes. - I'm sorry. I blame it on the margarita. I am usually very witty and charming. That's not an excuse. James Bond is fully hammered 24/7. He is always witty and charming. - Okay, I can give you some wit. Yeah? - Yeah? Wit me. - Yeah. Bring it. - Yeah? Okay. All right. When I look into your... Wow, that's... Is something supposed to be happening? I'm confused. Okay, okay. Pause, pause. I'm gonna try to give charming a shot. Okay, I'm... I'm gonna give you some charm, all right? Give you some charm. - No, that's worse. - Did you... - That was complete... Worse. - It's bad. I can't... Stop. Stop right now. Abort. - I'm gonna stop. - [people cheering] Whoo! Whoo! [chuckles] Whoo! Beat my best time again. That's weird, 'cause you're, like, 15 minutes late. Nah. Saturday mornings, there's a 20-minute grace period. Technically, I'm early. - Ready? - Come on. Let's go. Well, I might sweat margaritas after last night, so... - Gross. - I'm sorry. So, what is it you do again? - I'm in digital marketing. - What does that mean? We target consumers based on their GPS location. You know, go for impulse buys. What about you? I'm going into debt creation. Getting my master's in psych. You wanna be a therapist? I don't know. Maybe. People love talking to me, and I always give spot-on advice. So, yeah. [groaning] - Cramp. - You okay? You all right? I got a cramp. Lift your arm up. - Why? - It'll help. Trust me. Okay. Um... I lied to you. I hate running. I'm a really bad runner. God, this was a horrible idea for a first date. Oh, so this is a date? No. [scoffs] All right. We have a little more left. Hey, what are you doing? I earned one of these. - No. Not on my watch. Come on. - What? - I got something better. Come on. - No, come on. - [Sol] Last wind. - So far. [Sol] That's right. - Wait. There are hot dogs here. - There are hot dogs. You took me from a hot dog stand to another hot dog stand. Isn't this a great finish line? I love this place. [man] Hey! - Sol! How you doing? - [Sol] Hey! - What's happening, buddy? Okay. - [man] I'll be right out. - Ah! - [Sol] What's up, man? - How you doing? - I'm good. - What you got for us? - My new zucchini fritters. Ooh! Oh, Peter, this is Jenn. - Hey. - Hi. She wanted hot dogs for breakfast. - No, I wanted hot dogs for brunch. - All right. Well, brunch, it's not really about food. It's more about day drinking, isn't it? [Jenn] Exactly. If I wasn't jogging, I would totally be at my cousin Gigi's place. Pepper and Salt. Oh! They got a great Moscow mule. Love that spot. So, what do you think? Mm! It's really good. Missing a little something. Uh, yeah. Could use a smidge of sour cream and dill. And a little bit of honey. - That'd be good. That'd be good. - Yeah. I gotta get you back on the truck, man. - You're a chef? - No. No, I'm not a chef. Oh, he's the best. And I need him back on the truck. - Stop. Stop. - I gotta get you back on here. I used to help out on some weekends, that's all. [Peter scoffs] "Help out." Hey, you wanna give it a try? Go ahead. [laughs] - [laughs] No. That look. - [Jenn] I'm sorry. I'm not really a zucchini person. I got something you guys will like, and I'll get you a couple waters. - Thanks, man. - Thank you. [Sol] Every vendor's local. [Jenn] I can't believe I've never been here. These are nice. God, these colors are amazing. - [Sol] Yeah. These are beautiful. - [Jenn] Thank you. [Sol] Thank you. - Hi. - [woman] Hi. - These are beautiful. - [woman] Thank you. Rose. I love lavender. Mmm. Thank you.

[Steph] All right. I'd eat that. Come on, Eric. You making that for Jenn? Uh, yeah. I'm just gathering some ideas. Her mom's driving down next week, and I wanna make a good first impression. Mom. That's big. In other news, Yasmin wants your presentation deck by lunch. No. She said tomorrow. She did. And now it's Tuesday. And you've been working here for almost a year, and you're still surprised by Yasmin's little surprises. And I love that about you. I really do. - Good luck. - Okay. He was on a work trip. What was I supposed to do? - [knocking] - All right. - He might have been lying about that... - [Sol] Jenn, open the door! This is why I gave you keys! - I forgot them. I gotta pee. - You are so cute together. I swear, it makes me wanna barf. - Okay, see you later. - Goodbye, Amanda. - I got everything you asked for. Hey. - How are you? - How was your day? - Sideways, backwards. - How was studying? - Third pack of these. Got it. Gosh, okay. Why sideways? Why backwards? It's nothing. Well, I basically tracked people to and from their work today, and then I spent a couple more hours doing other departments' work because Yasmin won't hire more people, but it's fine. I'm sorry. I just can't believe this is how I spend my day. Sol, I told you my cousin Gigi needs more help at the restaurant. - Jenn, it's fine. It's fine. - Quit your job. You've been talking about it for months. Now or never, right? Or if you're not gonna quit, at least try working there on the weekends, learn the kitchen. People go to school to become chefs. Not everybody. And everything you cook is amazing. Coming from someone who eats Ding Dongs for dinner? Well, I'm not an elitist like you. I'm a foodie of the people. Look, I'm just trying to be practical, okay? I can't afford to quit. I've thought about it over and over again. I just... I can't. I have to think about savings, I have to think about the future and... And when I think about us, it... Move in with me. I mean, it cuts down on costs, right? You know I can barely afford the rent on this place, and... then, maybe, eventually you can save up enough money to quit. I will kick you out if you suck to live with, and I'm gonna know fast. Rules. Closets will be split 80-20. In my favor. - Fine. - Okay. Um, you cook a minimum of... five... - Three. Okay, three. - Okay. Three. Three times a week. That seems respectable. - Okay, only if you try everything once. - Fair. Real talk. Step up when it's time to step up. Mistakes I can handle, but regrets I can't live with. Deal. But I get to bring in my couch. - But my futon. - That futon has got to go. Fine. Eventually, we get a dog. No yappers, no shedders. No yappers, no shedders. Sex before dinner. Because after dinner, I only want TV. - Hmm... - Is that a yes? [Sol] Dave. We're gonna do it on three. - Here we go. One. - [Kyle] You got it? - Yes. Two. - [Dave] Use your legs. - Here we go. Three. - [Sol] Yes. [Dave] Could you slow down? I'm a bit hungover. - [Sol] My foot? Good? - Yeah, you're good. - Don't step off. - [Sol] Be careful. Wait. Why are there weights on the couch? Dude, we're already halfway. - I didn't put 'em there. - We can't take 'em off now. Okay. All right. All good. Are you sure this thing is gonna fit through the elevator? Yes, it is. I measured it, like, four times. All right, let's go. We're gonna move it in. Dave, what are you doing? Yo! [Sol] I guess we're taking a break. [Jenn] Working hard, huh, boys? I just put these on. That's not... - Ouch. - We been working this whole time. It sure puts the "ouch" in couch. How many more boxes do you want to bring up? Not that many. There's maybe, like, 20 more. I don't think we're gonna have any more room. - We're gonna have to get a storage space. - What? We don't need a storage space. We can fit all this in there. Every single box is labeled "kitchen." - It looks like a lot, but it's not a lot. - We already have a TV. - Not in the bedroom. - Exactly. Okay. - I call it. - I'll take it. We could get matching sweaters. Hey, can you hand me those? Pomegranate seeds on meatballs, eh? Yes. Here. [mellow pop music playing on stereo] Mmm! It's so good. I'm serious. It... It tastes like magical meatballs that grow on tiny, little meatball trees. Sol, Gigi would love those. [phone buzzing] I gotta... It's for work. - Is it important? - I gotta answer it. - Yes, it's... - Work is important. - I don't want you... - [buzzing continues] Ooh! I like when you keep it on vibrate. [chuckles] [brushing] - Hey. - Hey. [water runs, stops] Are you my toothbrush twin? ♪ My toothbrush twin ♪ ♪ And we brush our teeth up and down ♪ ♪ And all around ♪ ♪ Go round and rou... ♪ Are you okay? Yeah. Pulled a muscle working out. [R&B music playing on stereo] [Jenn] Sol, it's ten o'clock. Eat something. Here. I thought you were gonna heat up the pizza. No, not tonight. We're eating it cold, chef. I know. I'm sorry. I have to send this out by tonight. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You've just been working late for the last few weeks. Keep on working. Pizza's fine. You know, I know another way to heat up the pizza. It tastes even better. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Stop. What are you doing? All right. I'll try it. Any recs would help. - Okay, try the Girls Rock section. - Okay. Keep going, going. - Yeah, right there. - Yeah. Hmm... Oh! - Pat Benatar? - Yes. She rocks. Always. Trust me. I remember when I was with our bar band. "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" brought the house down every night. - [laughs] - Well, you're right, you're right. [woman] Can I get almond milk with that? - Thank you. - [man] You're welcome. So, how's it going? Eh. Yeah, we're good. I don't know. Sol's been maxed out at work. I swear, he hates his job. He doesn't even wanna cook anymore, he's so stressed out. Why don't you, like, just plan something? You know, like, something festive. Get him cooking again. - Thanksgiving. - [gasps] Your house? Oh. Oh! Yo, Sol! Dust your apron off, bitch! - Like a break-dancing crew? - I don't believe you. - I had a crew. - No. - What? - I had a whole thing, yeah. - Oh! - Yum. - You almost done? - [Sol] It's coming. It's coming. Because it's about to get really real in here. - What is happening? - It's about to get... - No! - Kyle! Um... - Cleanup on aisle... - I didn't do it. - Mom? Help, help, help, please. - Now you leave. - Get me salt, white vinegar... - I got it. ...and dish soap. - And no more red wine for Kyle. - Salt. - That's your boy. - [knocking] - I'm so sorry. My hands are full. - Mina, hi. No, it's okay. - There you go. - Come in, come in. For you and also for you. - You inspired it. - Mina. - It's gorgeous. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Thank you for having me. - Please, come in. Hang up your coat. Baby. Oh, uh, Mina, Dave. Dave, Mina. - Hi. - [Jenn] She's an artist. - Can I hug you? - Yeah, sure you can. Hi. Nice to meet you. [laughs] - Look at this painting Mina gave us. - I love that. That's really cool. - Order's up. Share with everyone. - Thank you. That smells amazing. Okay. Um... Cheers. Oh. I think this couch is missing a few springs. Don't insult the couch, man. Me and this couch have a history. I spent many weeks sleeping on this when I was in between... places. [Kyle] You mean in between girlfriends. So, the couch is your longest relationship? [Amanda laughs] - Ouch. [laughs] - Sorry. Hey, I get it. I like the couch. I can see that. You are the couch. [laughing] - What's in the stuffing? - Hey, Gigi. It's sticky rice, shiitake, Szechuan sausage and coconuts. Mmm! Hit me. [Dave] You're just a head. You look like Zordon. [Eric] We're all having fun. - [Sol] Careful, it's hot. - Okay. Mmm! You just messed me up. Oh, my God. Szechuan sausage? You just straight up messed me up. Hit me again. - Jenn, your man. - I know, right? Come on. Wait. I would serve this in my restaurant. - Yeah? - My chef could use a little inspiration. You need to come work for me, Sol. What else do you have here? Miso carrots, and then we've got a little bit of garlic bok choy. [Gigi] This is wonderful. [all gasping, murmuring] - Beautiful finish. - [woman] I'm taking a lot. [chattering] Corn bread? - [man] Just load it. Load it. - Oh, oh! - You want it all. - I want it all. No, no, no, Head Chef. Head of the table. - Me too. I don't want the middleman here. - Just waiting for the host. [Jenn] Grabbing 'em all. - [Amanda] Good for you. - [Kyle] Me too. - [Mina] Looks amazing, right? - [Jenn] Thank you. These carrots would piss my dad off to no end. Wait. What? Why? Because he would spend all day slaving away in the kitchen making Thanksgiving dinner, and then Sol would show up with carrots, and it'd be the hit of the night. [all laughing] That's why I only ever let you make dessert. Sol, Jenn, I wanna thank you. If you hadn't invited me tonight, I'd probably be sitting at home eating a frozen dinner. [Jenn] You're so welcome. Oh! Wait. Hold on. Mmm. Sol and I would like to say, um, thank you, guys, so much for being here today. Now our house finally feels like a home. New friends, new smells, new stains on my new carpet, but... [Jenn's mother] No stains! [Jenn] Yes, thanks to Mom, no stains. No stains at all. Oh, yes. I'll do it. Here we go. I got it, I got it. [all yelping] - Are you okay? - My God. Are you okay? - I'm fine. - [all laughing] We're good. That was fun. - [Gigi] Did you chip a tooth? - Thank you. - [Gigi] What happened? - Also, I just put in my two weeks' notice. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. You're taking our bed, okay? No arguments. - You won't get one from me. - I'll get you set up. Guys, guys, guys. - Hey. - Hey, hey. Amanda. Kyle, come on. Okay, so I think we got the three-piece... We'll just meet at... Three-piece band confirmed this morning. Everything's fine. Hey. - What? - Nothing. [Kyle] Everything's cool. Dinner was great. [Jenn] You can train, like, crows or magpies to, like, not be your pet but kind of be around you. - I want this whole thing to be... - I love the way your brain works. Oh, my God, you're such a dork.

You're cooking with a real-life superhero. Go, Chef. [Neil] All right, order up! [Gigi] Sol, Jenn's here. I'll let Gigi explain. You have to use your imagination a little bit, but after the wedding, the doors will open, everyone'll come out. - Then there's lights... - Okay. - ...everywhere, and flowers. - Forget about the things around. - Clean all this junk up. - We'll move all this stuff. It would make it a lot bigger, yeah? - Yeah. - If we open that up? [Gigi] It'll all be open, so it'll feel like one big space. [Jenn] It'll be really nice. - I mean, this is kinda perfect, isn't it? - It is. [Jenn] It's kind of... Perfect? It's gravel. You cannot dance on gravel. - Hey. - Cool. Everyone's here. Welcome. I thought you were gonna be here a half hour ago... [Kyle] The driver got lost... Is this... Yeah. Okay. No, I'm not letting you guys get married here. Nope. Okay.

And reach for the sky - and touch the ground. - [phone chimes] - I'll be right back. - [instructor] Come on, y'all. And squat... and jump. Now reach and stretch it up... [Amanda] We're not doing that one anymore? [instructor] And bounce it out. [Sol] His name is Otis. He's ours. Why do we have a dog? Why do we have a dog? Mendelson said the level of aggression is very concerning. [sighs] Absolute worst-case scenario is six months. He said he can get us into a brand-new clinical trial. Four months of radiation, - coupled up with chemo, combined... - Sol. Hey. Hey, hey. I think that there are options, okay? He seemed pretty positive about this being the best path. Hey. I'm gonna beat this. I will. - Okay. - All right. [Jenn] And then how it all kinda piles on and... I don't know. I know. But, like, he can't keep working, can he? Well, he wants to. I mean, as much as possible. But realistically, he's only gonna be able to, I don't know, be there two, maybe three times a week once chemo starts, and then it's just... - Okay. - [sighs] So what about, uh, the wedding? You guys still gonna do that? We gotta postpone. We have to cut costs and cut stress. He'll be in remission by August. Yeah, but with no immune system. Well, what can we do? I mean, like, what can we do for you? I don't know. [woman] I'm sorry. Traffic. - Hey, Hope. - Hey. Hey. So, where's Kyle? I don't know. I've been trying him. Disappeared on Sol. [Megan] Come on. He's going through a really hard time, considering everything that he just went through. It's not about him. [Hope] Okay, so what's the plan? I think that they want a really nice wedding. And I think we should give them one as soon as possible. To have everyone around, watching their first dance. To have yummy food and champagne and just make it really special for them. And I think that would be so fantastic. It would be. It would be fantastic. How? [Sol] Come on, buddy. [chattering] - [Sol exhales] - [man over PA] Dr. Marcus to Room 329. That okay? - Yeah. It's okay. Thanks. - Okay. - [Jenn] I'm good. - Come on, Otis. [in baby voice] He's had too many sausage tacos. Does the dog come with the place too? Uh, no. He's ours. Oh. Figured they'd tack it to my bill or something. You should read a good book. A book would take you out of all this. I should be at spring break reading a bar menu right now. Oh, spring break happens every year. There's a one-in-five chance that I don't see next year. You could flip the numbers. Four out of five you do. What about you two? You guys got any plans after all this? Well, eventually get married, go on a honeymoon. Somewhere tropical. My vote is the Bahamas. Yeah, I'm bringing my red Speedo and tanning oil. No, absolutely not. No tanning oil for either of you. - No Speedos, either. - Okay. I will give you the benefit of distraction one more time. - You see? You see that? - Look at what? Nothing happened! - Nothing happened! - Did you? A little bit, but... They're here. They're here. Uh, hey, guys. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. What's up? I mean, we know you guys are strapped for cash 'cause of all the medical bills and stuff, but we don't want you to put your life on hold. So, some of us thought that we should ask for your permission, but you really can't say no. - Megan. - It's kind of already happening. - The wheels are in motion. - Wait. Whoa, whoa. What's happening? Neil and Gigi are on food. Chris has a hookup with flowers, and drinks, of course. Guys, weddings take months to plan. And yours will take three weeks. And we already did the math. $20,000 should cover it. - [scoffs] - [Megan] But we're handling it. First things first. We should ask for their permission. Now, each of us donated $200. - Just, you know, get it started. - [Dave] Yeah. I'm gonna e-mail everyone at my office. And I can e-mail my whole client list. We have a couple of fundraiser ideas that... Yeah. Guys, we're really touched, but this just seems impossible. You know, we're asking for a lot of money from friends and strangers. I don't know. [Megan] Hey. We can do this. And you deserve it. What do you think? Bring it. - Ah! - [giggles] ["Good Feeling" playing] ♪ 'Cause I wanna go back To the days of the past ♪ - Thank you so much. - [man] Thank you. ♪ But I'm holdin' you close And I'm lettin' her go ♪ Share the link with people.

Brats throwing an anniversary party for their parents, fighting the whole time. I pulled the plug on their whole affair with one tug. Yoink. Of course, we are so happy that this is now available for an occasion as special as yours. Gratis. You're welcome. I... I mean, we... How can we ever thank you for that? - That is so generous. - Yeah. - This is beyond... - Let's hug this out later, kids. We spoke on the phone about us handling the food ourselves. Sol's a chef. That makes my life easy-peasy. Time to talk booze. Cocktails out on the terrace. You're gonna need a signature drink, - so who's up for a morning tasting? - [Dave] Yes. [Amanda] Uh-huh. Me too. Following you. [whispering] Oh, my God. - This is crazy. - Wow. - Do you have more of this? - [chattering] [clears throat] Ready? - [Hope] Oh! [gasps] - [Amanda] Yes. Oh, my God.

Okay. - [Hope] That's right. - And it's way too expensive. - Oh, no, no. No matter what dress you choose, there are no price tags. That's very sweet. Thank you. Oh, my God. I found it. [Jenn gasps] Megan. It's the one. Look at this. "I'm a tin suit man." [both laugh] Hmm. Whoa! I am not paying this much for a suit. You're not paying for anything. People donated to your wedding. You can't show up like some schlub in an ill-fitting suit. They're gonna think you ripped them off. Hmm? [scoffs] Besides, the best man can't be the best dressed. He can be the best looking, - but not the best dressed. - [laughs] Man, you know, um... I asked Kyle to come down here. Jenn said it's like a... like a form of PTSD. You know, he was working with his dad, side by side, until he got sick. Must have been hard watching him lose his battle. Yeah, maybe so. But I wouldn't expect much from him. Yeah, it's all good. - Only a couple more days, bro. - [exhales] Oh, God. Look at this tub. And this view. - It's nice. - Yeah, right? Tastes like copper. They warned you Keytruda might dull your taste buds. Yeah. You know, I have every single side effect from every single drug. Migraines, stomach pains. I know. You know, the clinical trials promise even more bonuses. Diarrhea, fun mouth sores and... Maybe it's a sign it's all working. Just... Just feels like a lot right now, I'm sorry. That's okay. Look, no problem. We'll skip the honeymoon. Maybe we skip all of it. The wedding? Jenn, it's gonna all be on display. And there's just a lot of people and then, like, you're gonna be this sad spectacle. - And I don't want you to be... - Sol, hey. Hey. This is gonna be the happiest day of our lives. I get to be your bride. Walking down the aisle to you. People will just see a widow in white. Why would you say that? - I don't want... - [scoffs] Don't say that. That's... I just... Look, I just can't keep doing this to you, okay? The mood swings, the side effects, and... It's just getting really hard right now and I... - Hey, um, I'm... I'm gonna make some tea. - Jenn, I'm just... - I'm just trying to tell you, it's... - No, I'm gonna... Maybe I should stop treatment. What? Sol? I am in this with you. Okay? We knew that this was gonna be hard. [sighs] So is that what's happening now? You're just gonna start making decisions without me? You don't understand what I'm going through right now. - I want to. - No, you don't want to. Yes, I do. Do not tell me what I want to and don't want to. I don't want you to know. Let's just make it easier for both of us, okay? God, you are being such a selfish prick right now! - [Sol] I'm being selfish? I'm being... - Yes! You don't get to choose when I tap out. - Well, do I get to choose? - Not alone. Not anymore. Sol? Sol, you... You don't know what this feels like, okay? Well, then explain it to me. Explain it to me, and then we can talk about it. If you explain it to me, then I can help. Then I can... We can fix this. It would be much easier if I was alone with my meds and my doctor and my... end! [door opens] [door closes] Do you remember what I said when you moved in, Sol? We had a deal. You promised you were gonna step up when it was time to step up. No regrets. Please keep your word. Jenn... [sniffles] I can't taste anything. The meds that are supposed to be helping me took my sense of taste. I'm a chef. They couldn't take away the others. Instead, they take taste? If they took sight, you wouldn't be able to see me. And if they took hearing, you wouldn't be able to hear my voice. If they took touch, you couldn't feel this. No early goodbyes. No giving up. I'm no widow, Sol. I am your bride. And that is all you're allowed to see. [Sol] Let's go get married. - [man 1] Got two more? - [woman 1] I need more tablecloths. [Amanda] Gotta get this champagne on ice, guys. - [woman 2] These going inside? - [Megan] Yep. Everything inside, to the left. [man 2] Give me a second, I'm getting it from the back. And you don't think it will look too dark if we do it like this? I love this song. [chattering] I don't know what I'm looking for. [Hope] It's nothing. Just look for some soap. This song is my jam! - [Jenn] Mom? - [Hope] Yeah? - [Jenn] Is everything okay? - [Hope] Sure. [screams] [Hope] Okay, um, there's a little mark on your dress. It's not much. - It's not... - [Megan] Amanda! - Are you kidding me? - She's overreacting. She's completely... - It's a little wine. A little wine. - [Amanda] Rosé won't stain. What are you talking about? Rosé is red. Mandy, this is two strikes. Guys, as long as the stain's not on my butt, I don't care. Step aside, boys. Hot shoes coming through. Where's Sol? Sol? Yeah, hold on. Jerome, come try Dave's Margarita. [Jerome] I'm working. I don't drink while I'm working. Chris, can you have Gigi check the kitchen? Make sure nothing's overcooked. Everything can survive if it's a little undercooked. And the octopus needs to be charred for at least... [Dave] Octopus will be fine, man. Just relax. Do not worry about this, please. Everything's gonna be incredible. I will talk to the chef, okay? Yeah, okay. Oh, yeah. - Chris. Chris. - Yeah, sure. Okay, yes. - Yeah. Let me just get that. - Thank you. [door opens, closes] Big day, dude. It's gonna be perfect. Just like you and Jenn. Maybe not as perfect as my margarita, but... - What's this? - Open it. Find what you love and do it. - [Dave sighs] - [Sol] Don't wait. Dude, these are fire. Never forget chance. I'll go put them on. - Straight? - [Dave] Look like a million bucks. [band playing instrumental "Don't Look Back in Anger"] [laughs] [Megan clears throat] We... - Okay. Ooh... - [scattered chuckling] Okay. We are gathered here today for Jenn and Sol. Two people who give us all hope... that true love does exist. Um, you know that everyone here stepped up to make this happen, because we know you and because we love you. [sniffles] Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I can't do this. I'll do this. All right, um... Wow, a lot of metaphors, Megs. [all chuckle] You guys are the real deal. I have never known a couple whose love is as deep as Jenn and Sol's. - [cries] Oh, my God. This is so hard. - I know. Just say your vows, man. Jenn Carter... I vow to never stop loving you. Because of you... I have found someone in me... that I never would have known. Someone that I never would have become. You found me. You found me. Thank you. Thank you for showing me what home is... what living is, and for showing me that I can be great. I love all of you. - With all I have. - [Jenn cries] And I will... all my life. [exhales] Solomon Chau. When I first met you... on our first date at the farmers' market... I will always remember this moment where I turned to find you... and just for one second, I couldn't. And even though I had just met you, I missed you. Every morning, I wake up and I choose you. I choose us. I choose this. I vow to never stop loving you. [guests applauding] Kiss him! Kiss, yes.

[Dr. Mendelson] The cancer has spread to the entire area. We're moving into quality-of-life considerations. If there are any questions that aren't easy to ask, you need to ask them. Um... I can't think of any questions right now. Not questions for me. Questions to ask Sol. I'm sorry. I'll be up in a second, okay? I'm just gonna park. Buddy. [door closes] No! No! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! No! No! Hey. Is there room for me? [Sol] There's always room for you. Who you rooting for? Stumpy arms. Oh. How's that? Good.

At first, I thought it didn't seem like a lot of time. But then again, how many days do we remember anyway? But everything can change. In a day. In an instant. Guys. It's amazing. And what might be missing becomes so very clear. [camera shutter clicks] - Thankfully, for me, for all of us... - Show me around. - ...Sol made it clear. - [Dave] Guys, Jenn's here. A full life can't be a series of forgotten days. - Welcome. - Legit! If you're not happy, change. Shift gears. Take a chance. Later is not guaranteed. Life is not meant to be lived later. [inaudible dialogue] Sol always looked for moments. A laugh, a kiss, a taste, a dance. That was his gift to us. Reminding us to collect moments every day. Because in finding those moments, days will never blur. In those moments, you will find yourself. [Amanda] Jenn? There isn't a better time than right now. Okay. Can't believe you guys managed to keep this a secret. [chuckles] He made us promise. I'm scared. Oh, no, no. There's nothing to be scared of. We should go to the pool. Meet us there? Midday frozen cocktails, I think, are just really good for the soul, and I... She officially has a thing for this bartender. No, I don't! He just makes good piña coladas. And he's funny and smart and cute. Yeah, that's a start. [laughs] - Okay, I'll see you guys down there. - [Amanda] Bye. [Sol on video] Happy honeymoon, Jenn. Hopefully, this video puts a smile on your face. I just wanted to say one more time... thank you. Thank you for saving my life. Thank you for seeing me so clearly, and... I wish we had more time together. But we made the best... that we could with what we had. And that was more than enough. So, when you think of me, don't think of me as sick. Think of me like this. - [laughing] - [Sol vocalizing] Go ahead. Open the box. It's about 50 zucchini recipes which you will learn to love. - I... - Hey, baby, have you seen my coat? Uh... [snickers] What do you think? [Jenn] Wow. It's a choice. Let me process that information. I have to walk the dog. - Wait, what are you... - Okay. [Sol] Okay. Okay, go. Go, go... I love you! I actually like it. [sighs] I love you. I love you. - [seagulls squawking] - [waves lapping] [Jenn] I wish we had more time together, but I am so grateful for the time we had. Because of Sol, I'm living for today. Living for now. And I know what it means to love. And be loved. To truly feel loved. I'll let the moments in my life guide me. And heal me. And strengthen me. And inspire me. I will live that way. Every day. All my life.
