I don't know what ails the man. -Kill you? Kill you, you say? I know what will happen. I may be crazy. Yes, maybe I am crazy, but I know I will not get out of here alive. -Ain't that beat all. -Johnnie. -Nothing. I ain't done nothing. -In this house. -I will go away because Ido not wish to be killed. -You tell me what you've doneto this man, you young devil. Now speak up. -I told you, I ain't done nothing. -Never mind. I will leave this house becauseI do not wish to be killed. SCULLY: You will not leave. -Maybe I'm crazy, but Iknow that I must go away. -You will not leave. You're in my hotel, and I willnot allow any peaceable man to be troubled here. -I'll just get my thingsand go away from here now. SCULLY: You won't. -It is what I must do to save my life. -No. You will not leave, not untilI find out what's going on. Mr. Blanc, can you tell me whatthese boys have been doing? -Mr. Scully, I didn't seethem do anything wrong. -But what does it all mean? A man wants to leave my hotel because he's feared he's going to be killed here. Now what in hell does that mean? -Look, I told you ain't done nothing. Now, he is the craziestdamn loon I have ever seen. Good God. -Well, I've worked long and hard to make this a respectable establishment. Nothing like this has everhappened before, nothing. Ah, here you are. Oh no. You just calm down. I can't think how you ever gotsuch an idea into your head. Oh, did you think they werereally going to kill you? Oh, you must be daft. -Oh, no. No. Some people in this worldknow pretty nearly as much as you do. You understand? -Oh, my man. We're going to have a line of electric street cars in this town next spring, and there's a new railroad being builtfrom Broken Arm to here, not to mention the four churches. Oh, and a smashing brick schoolhouse. And then there's a new big factory. My man, in a few more years, Romper will be a regular metropolis. -How much money do I owe you? -You don't owe me anything. I'll not take your money. You know-- you, come with me a minute. -No. SCULLY: No, come along. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Don't be afraid. I want you to come and see a picture. Come along. This is my little girl that died. Her name is Carrie. She had the purtiest hair you ever did see. I was that fond of her. But she-- look here, man, I'm showing you. This is my little girl that died. And look at this. A picture of my oldest boy Michael. He's a lawyer in Lincoln and doing real well. Oh, I gave that boy a grand education, and now he's an honored and respected gentlemen. And now there's only one more thing. I'd keep it under me pillow ifit wasn't for that boy Johnnie. I don't know where is it now. Aha. Here it is. [LAUGHING] Oh ho ho ho. Come out with you now. Oh. Here it is. [LAUGHING] Oh ho ho. Oh, come out with you now. Hmm. This here comes all the way from India. A sea captain brung it to me. Genuine Bombay gin. I'll just see if somebody pinched a nip. I save it for special occasions. Drink. Come on, drink man. Drink. That's it. Aha. Drink! Go on. Go on. Have a good drink. That's it. Ah, that'll warm you up right down to the bottom of your feet. It'll make you feel better all over. You see, there's nothing to be a'feared of here. -I wonder what in the hell my old man is doing up there so long with that Swede. -He ain't no Swede. -Well, what is he then? -It's my opinion he's some kind of Dutchman. Yes, sir. A Dutchman. -I don't know what in the hell he is. He said he's a Swede. He said he's Swedish. What do you think he is, Mr. Blanc? -Oh, I don't know. -What the hell do you thinkmakes him act that way? -He's crazy. EASTERNER: He's scared. He's scared clear down to his boots. -Well what at? -I don't know. Maybe he's been reading dime novels and he thinks he's in the Wild West. Billy the Kid, DaltonGang, shootings, killings. -This ain't Wyoming nor none of those places. This here's Nebraska. -I don't know why in the hell he didn't wait till he got out West to get so scared. -It's not where he is, it's where he thinks he is-- in the middle of hell. -He's a queer bird, all right. I sure hope we don't get snowedin here with that feller. [HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER FROM UPSTAIRS] -I wish my pa would throwhim out in the snow, just throw him out, out. -Come on now. Move over there and giveus a chance at the stove. -There's plenty of room on the other side. SCULLY: Get over there. -Oh, let the boy sit where he wants. [music box playing] I'm thirsty. -Thirsty? Well, what would you like? -Water. Water? I'll get you something to drink. -No, I'll get it. Hello. I want a glass of water. I want some water, do you hear? -Can you imagine? Upstairs just now, he thoughtI meant to poison him. -Huh. That's not a bad idea. Who the hell does he think he is? Hmm? You know? I've got a mind-- I've got a mind-- -Just hold your tongue. I keep a hotel here, boy,a hotel, and that gent is a guest. -Well, that gent a few minutesago was afraid of breathing. And now, he is just sassy as hell. -A guest under my roof has privileges and ain't to be intimidated. I'll not allow it. There's no place in this town where they can say they took in a guest of mine because he was afraid hewas going to be killed here. Am I right? -Yes, Mr. Scully. -You're certainly right, Mr. Scully. -Ah, let me see what's cooking in here. [wind howling] Bring me some more wine. When I get back to New York, I'm going to tell all the bignewspapers about this place. They'll have to knock down the walls, maybe bring in a few musicians. Perhaps Johnnie could do the dishes. Maybe he could throw somejelly beans into the air, catch them in his mouth for a trick. Maybe the girls can learn to cook. No, I was only joking. Scully, maybe you and Iought to become partners. Well, Mr. Scully, that was a pretty damn good meal. Not bad for a little fleabag hotel like this, hmm? -Why don't you license that Swede to kick you down the stepsof your flea bag hotel? [burp] -Eh, he's full of brass all right. But at least he ain't scaredof getting killed no more. -You want to know what I think? I think-- I think you oughtto throw him out in the snow, throw him right out. Out with him. -Anybody want a game of High Five? High Five. High Five. -Hmph. -You afraid? -Are you kidding? Let's play. Gentlemen. [inaudible] deal. Looks like I deal. Cut. [laughter] Oh boy. -Oh, yeah. Finally we got the cards this time. -Bid. -Three spade. -Pass. -Pass. -Three spade. -Uh-huh. -Pass. -No card? -Cards. -Give me two. -Cards. -Three. -Let's go. Who's the loser? -One.

Maybe you think I can't fight. Well, you're a card sharper,you're a card rigger, and by God, yes, we will fight. -Let's get to it. -Gentlemen, please, please. It's so silly to fight over a game of cards. Please. We were only playing for fun. -No. No, let them fight. I can't stand it any longer. I've put up with this damnSwede till I'm sick of him. Let 'em fight. Put on your coat, Johnnie. [inaudible] Now hand me that lamp there. Let's go. -I won't stand [inaudible]against the bunch of you. -What's that you say? -I say, I won't stand [inaudible] against the bunch of you. I know you'll gang up on me. -My man, what do you think we are? -You're all a bunch of bastards. -Stranger, take your place. Johnnie, Johnnie, take your place. -I know what kind of game this is. I know you'll all gang up onme, and I can't lick you all. -You'll only have to whoop my son Johnnie. No other man'll trouble ya. If they do, they'll havePatrick Scully to answer to. This is a fight to thefinish with no holds barred. Now. -Do it to him, Johnnie. You've got him, boy. Kill him. Kill him, boy. You've got him now. Kill him. -Keep quiet, you! [yell] -Get him, boy!

Can you walk, boy? Can you walk? -Did I hurt him any? -Can you walk? -Did I hurt him any? -Sure didn't hurt him bad. -Help him up, lads. Bring him into the hotel. Come along. Help him in. Come along. [laughter] -Johnnie. What's happened? [inaudible]. Hold him up. -Give us room, lad. Get him to the [inaudible]. -[inaudible]. -It's all right, now. He's just beaten up a little bit. Go fetch some water and we'll wash him up. Now go on, lass. Fetch some water. We'll wash him up andwe'll-- we'll put him to bed. You all right, Johnnie? JOHNNIE: I'm OK. -I'd like to take that damn Swede, and hold him down on thefloor, and beat him to jelly. -I'd like to get him by the neck and hammer him, hammer that damn Dutchmanuntil you couldn't tell him from a dead coyote. -That's what he needs, a good beating. -By God, I think I'll hammer him right now. -No. No, that wouldn't do. It wouldn't be right, you know. -Why in the hell wouldn't it be right? -He's right, Bill. It wouldn't be right or fair. It was Johnnie's fight,and we mustn't whip the man because he whipped Johnnie. -Well, that may be true, but hebetter not get cheeky with me. -You will not say a word tohim nor lay a hand on him. Whatever he done to Johnnie, he is a guest in my hotel, a guest under my roof. -I'm going to get out of hereand check into a real hotel down the street. How much I owe you? -You don't owe me nothing. -You don't owe me nothing. -Stranger, I don't see howcome you're so damn cheeky-- -Bill, you shut up. -Scully, I asked how much I owe you. -I told you, you don't owe me nothing. -I guess you're right. Maybe you owe me somethingfor teaching your boy a lesson he won't forget. That's what I guess. Kill him, kill him, kill him, kill him. SCULLY: Sir, won't youplease clear out of here? -Good evening, gentlemen. They old me at the stableI might find a room here. It's a bad night out there. -It is that, sir. Would you step over to thestove and warm yourself. -Thank you. -Here. I'll take your things. -Sir, we'll be glad to put you up when you're ready to go to bed. We have a very nice room for you. The gentleman is just now checking out. I'll get the girls to straighten it out. Would you care for somethingwarm to drink, sir? -Some tea, please. -Get him a real drink. I've got something to celebrate. Ah, this isn't bad weather. It's good weather for me. I like this weather. I like it fine. Want to hear why this is great weather for me? I had a fight here earlier tonight. I knocked the living soulout of a man right here. Johnnie Scully, the son of this man here. -Your tea will be down directly. You were just leaving. Why don't you keep going and let us alone? You done enough trouble here tonight. Now get out, please. -Oh, I just want to have afew words with this gentleman. Johnnie Scully. He'll be feeling prettynearly dead for a few weeks, I can tell you. I really made a mess of him. They had to carry him back into the house. Mister, I'm telling you what I just did to a man here a few minutes ago. It ain't polite to turn your back on someone when they're talking to you. -I'm telling you for the lasttime, get out of my hotel. -It's impolite to turn your back on a man when he's talking to you. -Now please, take your hand off my shoulder. -Hey. Do turn and look at me when I'm talking to you. [scream] -If there's a sheriff or a marshal in this town, you should send for him now. If you'll give me a room,I'll wait for him there. -Oh, yes. Follow me, sir. -You were all witnesses thatthis man was abusing me. The room, please. -Oh, yes. I knew there was going to be trouble with that Swede. [inaudible]warning [inaudible]. Just step in here, sir. Make yourself comfortable. I'll go after the sheriff. Oh, such a terrible thingto happen just like that. [wind howling] [dog howling] -What do you think they'lldo to the stranger? -I don't know. -You think they'll let him off, give him a short term in prison? -I don't know. When they ask me, I'll tell 'em how it was. That Dutchman was crazy. He was crazy and a fool. But the way he said thatJohnnie was cheating just goes to show you how crazy he was. -Johnnie was cheating. -Huh? -Johnnie was cheating. I saw him hiding a card under his handkerchief, and I never said a word. My God. The Dutchman caught Johnnie cheating and called him through on it. My God. -You know, if the Swede hadleft just five minutes earlier, he would've missed thestranger and none of this would've happened. But maybe it was all timed and figured to get the Swede killed. But one thing's sure. We all played our parts in his death. -What? -We're all in it. -Well, I didn't do nothing to him. I mean, you've got to admit, Mr. Blanc, that I didn't do nothing to him. But nothing. -Maybe you're right. Let's go. [music playing]
