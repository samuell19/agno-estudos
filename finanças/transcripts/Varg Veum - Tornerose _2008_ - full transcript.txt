COPENHAGEN - Who the hell are you? - Get out. She's going home! - Do you know him? - Don't speak to her! - Hey, I paid for this! - Come on! You don't get anything for this. Hey. It's legal, you know. She's 16 years old. Hey, Lisa, get dressed. Come on, put your coat on. Lisa, come on! - Who are you? - My name's Varg. You're going home. SLEEPING BEAUTY BASED ON A NOVEL BY GUNNAR STAALESEN - Is anyone not here? - No, I think everyone is here now. - Well, enough to make the vote valid. - As long as we have the majority. - Bergen Bank, how may I help you? - Hey, Varg Veum speaking. - Can I speak to Niels Halle, please? - The manager? One moment, please I'll just put you through. Yes. Oh, hello Veum, I'm golng to have to call you back. I'm in the middle of a merger meeting. Oh, you have Lisa with you? Great, Veum, really great. To the hospital? No I can't. I'm in the middle of a meeting. Can't it wait? OK, relax, I'll be there. Hasle. Damn! - Just five minutes, then we'll go. - I was better off where I was. Lisa. Thank you, Veum, we've been so worried about her. Hi Lisa, welcome home. It's good to see you. But what's that you're wearing? Let me have a look at you. Vigdis, maybe you should show her the surprise? - What surprise? - Come Lisa! Come on! We've redecorated Lisa's room. We've had Lisa's room redecorated and our own bedroom at the same time. Vigdis is good at that sort of thing. She likes interior decorating. - I see that. - You don't find it so interesting? - You don't have to impress me. - That wasn't my intention. - Let go of mel - You don't understand what I meanl Get outl They'll be down in a minute, I think. - She was really happy about the room. - That's nice, Vigdis. - Is she coming or not? - Relax. We'll take it from here. I promised Lisa we'd stay for five minutes, and then go on to the hospital. You can't promise Lisa anything. We're her parents; we'll take care of it. I think Lisa needs professional help. But surely, this is not the time to send her off to strangers, is it? When I found Lisa, she was in bed with a man who was older than you. And if you take a closer look at her pupils... - She has only just come home... - I know what I'm talking about. She needs to be tested for HIV and hepatitis. She is on drugs. It's not like she's addicted. Just make a list of all your expenses. We'll pay for everything, of course. I'll transfer the money immediately. - Hi. - Where is she? - Hello, Haakon. - Does Lisa know where Peter is? - No. - And you believe that? - What do you mean by that? - I have to talk to her. - No. Not now. - Excuse me, who are you? - Lisa was alone I Copenhagen. - This is Veum, private investigator. He found Lisa. Veum works for me. His job was not to find Peter. Vera Werner. This is my husband, Haakon. We live up here, so we saw you come. We were not keeping an eye on you. - Ask Lisa to come out here then. - Peter should keep away from her! Peter is our son, you see. For a while he and Lisa were going out with each other. Now he is gone, and he doesn't answer his phone. - Could you please help us? - How old is he? - 21. - I moved away from home long before. - We are worried about him. - Why are you worried about him? I don't see why that's so important. You'll be paid. I hope you find your son. Someone has been calling him on the phone, threatening him. I'm afraid he might have gotten himself into something dangerous. Maybe something he can't talk to you about? All families have secrets. Sometimes I get the job of rummaging though their lives. And every now and then I dig up truths that they'd rather I hadn't found. Hey... - We don't have any secrets, Veum. - Wouldn't that be nice? First you spend money you don't have. My money. Then you refuse to tell how you spend it. How stupid can you get, anyway? I only need a few more days. Just give me a few days. - OK, OK! - I already gave you a new deadline. You owe me half a million, Peter. You sold the dope. But how did you spend the money? I can't tell you that. But I'll pay you back more than what I owe you, I swear to you! Oh no, Peter. It's always a bad sign when people start swearing to something. - Don't you agree Atti? - Yes. OK, I promise you. - Oh, you promise me? - I promise you. You swear before God? Cross your fingers and hope to die. Yes. You know God now, do you? - Please, stop calling me. - I just want to talk to you. - I have to know how you are. - I know why you call me. I've mlssed you. - Have you mlssed me? - Yes. - You know, what happened... rlght? - Yes. You're not stlll mad at me? It dldn't mean anythlng. Llsa, I need help. - What happened? - Nothlng, I'll explaln everythlng later. I just want to see you agaln. - Why should I believe you? - Because I could never Ile to you. - Can you get me some money? - I don't have any. But you know someone who does. I don't know if I can do it. Please, Llsa. Don't you love me anymore? Hi. Hi, I'm here to see Peter Werner. Peter Werner... - He's not in. - Which room is he staying in? I can't tell you that, I'm afraid. - Maybe you can call his room then? - Yes, I suppose I can do that. - No, I'm sorry. - Why, it's not your fault. - No. - Nice moustache. Thank you. Hey, where are you going? I'm going to knock on the doors, until I find Mr. Werner's room. Unless you feel like telling me his room number? 417. Hello? Hello? Peter Werner? Well, there you are - again. Your hand is trembling. Have you seen something disturbing? - I don't find dead people every day. - No, we grow softer over the years. I already spoke to your colleague. The parents asked me to find him. And you have, so your job is done and everyone's happy. I hear you've been stomping around my crime scene. What did you do up there? I touched his... neck to check if he had a pulse. - OK. - I removed his duvet. I touch the door handle when I went in. The phone rang. I didn't answer it. And I got some blood on me. I got some blood on my hand and I wiped it off, a little here and a little there. A little here and a little there? You didn't take anything? No. - I threw up over by the door. - What? I threw up. Just like that. Damn, I felt so sick. You'll understand when you see him. We see people like him way too often, Veum. Rich home, lots of drugs, no limits. Kids who want to earn money fast. We know a little about Peter Werner. Maybe you know even more? - Not much. - Did he have a girlfriend? - I don't know. - Brothers or sisters? No, no brothers or sisters. His parents got threatening phone calls. They were worried about him. Well, I had been, too. They should have called us instead. A 21-year-old on drugs and does not want to sit at home with mum and dad. Would you have looked for him? No, there you see. He can be of some use to us now. The boy ran with the big guys and someone got back at him. Who? Veum, go home now. Go find some duvets to lift. And please don't help me. Otherwise it'll get all emotional. Do you think he went to heaven or to hell? The guy who drew these. He is dead. - Heaven. - Why do you think that? Because it looks like he was already in hell. Nice hair band, is it yours? What do you want? - I've been to a job interview today. - Great. My dad set up an appointment for me with someone he studied law with. Is it a good job? Did you get it? - Did you get it? - Yes. - Congratulations. - I turned it down. - Why? - I realised something. This job I can do. Work around the clock for others, with contracts, patents, litigations. I can do this in my sleep, I'm so sick of it. I realised that I didn't want the job; I just wanted them to offer it to me. Maybe also to show my dad that I could get it. - What'll you do instead? - I'll start my own practice, just like you. - A private investigator? - No, a law office. I'll start simple with ordinary people of flesh and blood. I'll begin with criminal law, maybe get a union to employ me. I want to feel that I'm doing something where... You can make a difference. If I can do it. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I've been offered an office. I'm going over to see it now. - Do you want to come? - As an office expert? No, I have an appointment with a dead man. Then ask him if he went to heaven. Can we see a little more? I have to know what they did to him. Oh... Veum, you must find out who did this. - The police are already investigating it. - They don't give a damn who killed him. For them he's just one idiot less. They only follow one lead in one direction. You were the one who found him, Veum. Yes. The police believe that this is related to a drug debt. Why don't you believe that, Haakon? Is there something you are afraid to tell me? Do you know who called and threatened you? No, I don't know. But someone came to the door the other day. He came to visit. He didn't appear to be like the others. He even introduced himself. - This has nothing to do with the case. - Do you remember his name? Bjorn Hasle. He was the slippery type, but polite. Why didn't you tell me this yesterday? I didn't say anything because Hasle said that - - he and Peter had a relationship. My son was not just a drug addict, - - he was also gay. Do you understand? Oh, right, no secrets? - Have you told this to the police? - Some things are private. - Will you be discreet? - Well, I can't promise you anything. I need to speak to Lisa. - I need to speak to Lisa. - She's a sleep. I don't think it's a good idea to disturb her. Besides, Niels thinks it's best if we take care of things ourselves. What do you think? It's all a little too much right now. Are you smoking in secret? - How are you doing? - Good, and you? I know you were at the hotel to see Peter. - I don't think you can keep it a secret. - Why would I? Did Peter have a relationship with someone else? Maybe that was why you went to see him? He called me. He wanted me to meet him at the hotel. At first I didn't want to go. I said no. - But then I went up there anyway. - What happened? We had sex. And afterwards? Don't you get it? We are together again. He's my boyfriend. He explained everything to me, we talked about it. Why did you go to Copenhagen, Lisa? - What were you running away from? - Oh, you don't understand anything. No, I don't so you have to explain it to me. What is it you're afraid of? This can be very dangerous. Who was the other one Peter was seeing? There is no one else now. He only wants me. - Do you know Bjorn Hasle? - I know who he is. He's a friend of Peter's. He works at my dad's bank. Why do you ask me this? Peter is dead. Yeah right... Are you lying to me now? He is not dead, he is not fucking dead! - Lisa! - He is not dead! - Lisa! - Lisa! - You just had to tell her, didn't you? - I had to. - Hi, are you Bjorn Hasle? - Yes, and who are you? I'd like to talk to you, about Peter Werner. I don't have much to say about that. Besides, now is not a good time. - Can I come in? - No, sorry. If you don't get out right now, I'm calling the police. Do it! Call the police. - Can't you just leave? - Yes, in a minute. But first I want to talk to you about Peter Werner. He is dead, right? Yes. It's quite simple. Peter and I were together, I was his customer, or one of them, anyway. I got sex and he got a little money when he needed it. Or when I needed it. - Shocked? - When did you last see him? - A couple of weeks ago. - Tell me what happened. Not much to tell. He needed money, lots of money. - I couldn't help him. - What did he need the money for? He owed half a million to someone called the Mink. - Is this the one you're afraid of? - I'm not afraid. You are scared to death. You thought I worked for the Mink? I didn't know what to believe. But you don't owe him money? Peter was furious when I couldn't help him, I didn't have that kind of money. I don't know what he has said to get away from it. - Do you know Lisa Halle? - No. No, but Peter did. She thought he was going to marry her and build a little nest on Fjellveien. I didn't quite fit into that picture, did I? - Bye. - Bye. - Are you ready? - Yes. OK. Get the junkies out and then move on to the next place. We are ready, go. - We've finished here and are moving on. - That's great Isachsen. I will keep an eye on the Mink and in the meantime you can... Damn, that man is everywhere! Veum, can we go for a walk? - What do you think you know? - Peter owed the Mink a lot of money. - How much? - I came here to find out. Do you think I work as a plumber in my spear time? After three years we can finally hook the Mink on something solid. You are using Peter Werner as a lever to get to the Mink. The family thinks there may be something else behind it. Like what? Love? - Maybe. - You be careful now, Veum. You said you didn't know if Peter Werner had a girlfriend, but you did know. Just before he died, he had sex. You knew that too, didn't you? Do you know who he had sex with? No! - He didn't have any brothers or sisters? - No, you can check that. We have checked it. And it's true. But the DNA on his body says something completely different. How is that? Well, someone in this is very closely related! So, Veum look at me. Is it your head or the test that's wrong? You have to do that test again. Somewhere there has to be a mistake. - Please, accept my condolences. - Thank you. - I'll just go and get my husband. - No, let him work, I can talk to you. It's a nice house. Must take a lot of work. Yes. - Did Peter grow up here? - Yes. I assume you've found something since you are here, I mean. I've found out what happened 21 years ago. Well, that was not what we paid you to find out, was it? Two houses so close together. Can't it get awfully close sometimes? - What do you mean? - The neighbourhood. Peter and Lisa must have been childhood sweethearts. Running in and out of each other's gardens, playing doctor in the bushes. Did you and Haakon ever think about having any more children? - Why are you doing this? - I snoop around, Mrs. Werner. I find out things that other people try to hide. You've even paid me to do so. And what good is all this snooping around? My son is dead. I think Peter has a sister, and I think you know who it is. Lisa was with Peter on the night he was killed. Did you know that? - No. - But you know that they were lovers? - I tried to stop it. - What did you say to him, Vera? That he wasn't his father's son? That he couldn't be with Lisa... because... You can't tell this to anyone. I haven't told Haakon. - I haven't told Niels. - Is Niels Halle the father? Yes. Before Peter was born Niels and I had an affair. To think that something so horrible could result in something so... lovely. No one needed to know anything, it was only me. There hasn't been a day where I haven't been reminded of this. Do you think Lisa killed Peter? - Do you think she knew? - I don't know. - Do you still want me to find out? - I really want you to go now. Go! Please. Veum. Lovely Vigdis, lovely. Wouldn't it be nice to go to the summerhouse for the week end? - What do you think, Lisa? - All of us or just the two of you? Well, it would be nice. No matter who goes. Do you have time? No, not this week end. I have to make sure that the merger doesn't fall to the floor. All we need now is a little extra guts and the signature and that's it. - Interesting. - Interesting. Yes, isn't it? Merger, merger, merger. Lisa, please! Take your pills now. It's for your own sake. Do as your mother tells you. I'll tell you this, Lisa. When this merger is finally in the box - - then I don't have to work anymore. It's going to be completely different. Much better, for you too, Lisa. It's for your sake as well that I... Hello. My condolences. Lisa. - Hey Varg, It's Anna. - Hello? Hey Varg, It's Anna. - What are you dolng? - I'm working. - Come out wlth me. - I can't, I'm busy. What are you dolng rlght now then? - I'm making invoices. - Rubblsh. You're just lonely. No! No, put me down! I was just playing. I have a bottle of wine at home. What do you mean? - I have a bottle of wine at home. - Do you think that's a good idea? It was my father who had arranged that office for me. - Did you take it then? - No, of cause not. The rent was so cheap because he had agreed to pay half of it. He only wants to help you. And that makes it OK to lie and hide things and pretend? He cares about you. You should be glad. There are plenty who don't give a damn. And then they call me when they have trouble with their kids. You solve people's problems, isn't that good? I find their kids, I deliver them to the doorstep. I solve the problem, right. But when I find what causes it, they don't want to do a damn thing about it. Their reasons are private, that's why they pay you. - The problem doesn't just vanish. - You do what's expected of you. I ruined a family today. Maybe two. I didn't solve a problem, I gave them a new one. Free of charge. It's not true! - Tell me it's just a lie. - What happened? You know that damn well. It's all your fault! - Come in. - No. - Come in. - No. All right, but stop screaming then. Hi. - Lisa, I'll take you home. - No fucking way I'm going home! Calm down now. I don't believe a word Peter's dad says. It wouldn't surprise me if he's the killer. I think it's best I leave now. - I wish I could tell you this wasn't true. - Nothing Peter did was good enough. OK. Good night, Lisa. - Who are you? - My name is Anna. I don't give a fuck about your name, and don't speak to me like you know me! You can borrow my coach, if you want. But only if you stop screaming. I'll scream as much as I want to. I'll scream as much as I want to, I said. I'll scream as much as I want. All right. Scream as much as you want. You couldn't have known this. And what happened to Peter was not your fault. But the police are looking for a killer. They may think it was you. Me? But I was the only one who loved Peter. It'll be easier for me to help you if you trust me. I don't dare to. I think you know something, but you don't want to tell it, not to me, not to anyone. It can be dangerous for you. Can I sleep here anyway? Of course you can, you'll be safe here. If you want to talk just wake me up. - Sleep tight. - Did I ruin your plans tonight? No, no, no. If you want, you can watch TV or a DVD. I've got lots of films. Can I sleep with you if I want? No. Lisa. Come on! I knew you weren't sleeping. - Do you drink coffee? - No. Where are you going? I made some breakfast. I have an appointment. I'll be right back. Can't you stay? Don't open the door to anyone, not even the police. - Thank you for coming. - Is Lisa with you? - Yes. - Why are we here then? - Lisa is not feeling well. - Who the hell do you think you are? How long is she going to stay with you? Until I find out who killed Peter. Why is she so angry with you if you don't mind me asking? There was always a competition between Niels and myself. A sort of power balance. Lisa was always daddy's little girl. He has spoiled her. I was the one who had to be firm and say no. - Lisa don't do anything wrong, he thinks. - Not even with Peter? Has your husband always known that they were brother and sister? If so, I'd never be able to forgive him. If he let it happen, without doing anything to stop it. Lisa doesn't need any more hatred right now. Do you have children, Veum? - No. - No. Why do you pretend you do then? - Yes? - Where? Where what? Have you changed your drinking habits? Where is Lisa Halle? Of course you have a warrant? I hear you have been babysitting without asking the parents. - Really? - I was told by a reliable source. Her mother. The mummy. Yes, she should know if anyone. I only live here. Well, you're going to have to look until you find her. Isachsen, please see if you can find her, and be thorough she may be hiding. - Yes, she is very small, you know. - She could have hidden anywhere. - No. Maybe upstairs? - Maybe upstairs, try there. We are very thorough, you see. Thoroughness is underestimated. It's so important. Isachsen! - Have you found anything? - No, it doesn't look promising. People used to be much more thorough. This country was founded on it. The DNA test matched Lisa Halle. - This is serious now, Veum. - It has been serious all along. She's not here! I don't know where she is. While you're running after junkies Lisa Halle's life is going down the drain. - I've cleaned up you place a bit now. - Are you done or shall I call the police? That's no use. I have turned off the cell phone. Isachsen, I want to go home! Damn, and this day started so well. HI there, you've called Bjorn Hasle I can't answer the phone rlght now, - - please leave a message and I'll call you back. - Who has done this? - The Mink. He wanted his money back. The money Peter owed him. What have you got to do with that? Absolutely nothing? I know you are lying. I'm very busy. Stop! Wait, stop! I was Peter's contact in the bank. I knew everything about the merger. - But I didn't have any money. - But Peter did? Yes. He sold some amphetamine for the Mink, worth 500,000. He bought stocks with the money, as a loan. We would have tripled the money after the merger. But then they took Peter. Who took Peter? The people who killed him, the Mink probably. The merger took much longer than we had expected. We were supposed to have signed the deal the day you brought Lisa back. And now the Mink is impatient. Now no one knows what happens to the stocks and the money are gone. - Lisa called you. Has she been here? - She called, she was all worked up. She wanted some money. Maybe Peter told her about the plan anyway. - What else? - What else? - What else? - I don't know. Stop! She called while the Mink was here half an hour ago. I told the Mink that she had the rest of the money. You told the Mink that Lisa had the rest of the money? They would have killed me. Just look at me! And then I asked her to meet me at my office in the bank. Thank you very much. Bye. - I'm here to see Bjorn Hasle. - Bjorn Hasle? - I'm afraid he is not here. - I have an appointment with him. - Now? - Yes. That's weird. You can wait over there if you want. - Can't you check it one more time? - No, he isn't here. Bitch. Are you Lisa? Who is asking? I'm sorry, my name is Martin. I knew Peter pretty well. It really was a shame what happened to Peter. I've met you before, too, I think. At Hotel Terminus. You were so high. Well, not more than I was, believe you me. I was so wasted that night. I love to party. So did Peter. - How are you doing? - OK. Is there anything I can do for you? Like what? Something that will make it all seem a little easier, a little more comfortable. No, I don't do that sort of thing anymore. I can see that. - I don't have any money. - It'll be OK. Come on, out of the way! Av, let go of me! Let me go! Help! Let me go! Let me go! Hey, it's me. Come on. Get away from her! Damn you! Anna? I need you to do me a favour. A small one. Yes now, right a way. - Is she in danger? - You only have to be here with her. Last time she ran away. I want you to talk to her. - Talk to her. - I don't know what to say. It took seven years to become a lawyer. I can loose it all in one afternoon. That's why I don't want to tell you anything more. Please. Please. Well, now it's just you and me then. Have you ripped your t-shirt? What happened? A fight. - Did you win? - Yes. I've been out shopping. Do you want see if we can find something you can wear? Pedersen to Hamre. Varg Veum is at the location. Nice seeing you again. Are you alone? That's nice, now we don't have to go and look for you. Tell the guy behind me to go away. - I don't like you. - Do you know who you are talking to? Yes. I'm talking to a pathetic guy. A pathetic guy, who hides behind dead fish while he's selling dope to little kids. A person who beats up defenceless people and makes fun of the police. I think I'm taking to the man who killed Peter Werner. - What is it you want? - I want to talk to you about Lisa Halle. I want to talk about the 500,000 that Peter Werner owed you. Half a million is a lot of money. It's not more than you'll make next week. Lisa Halle is a sixteen-year-old girl selling her body for drugs. She doesn't have your drug money. Peter Werner bought stocks with it and was waiting for a bank merger - - so he could cash in his winnings. Your money is stuck in his dead name. So if you killed him, you're even dumber than you look. And that's saying a lot. Don't make anymore mistakes now, OK. Let's strike a deal. You leave Lisa Halle alone. And I'll leave you alone, OK? Did I say something funny? Doesn't it hurt to laugh through a busted nose? Who the hell do you think you are? Veum, Varg Veum. You're a fucking zero. Don't you play Superman with me, Veum. Don't come here and tell me how to run my business. And don't talk to me like I was one of those damn junkies you love so much. I didn't kill Peter Werner. I haven't killed anyone since the middle of the 1990's. But you'll have to give me a damn good reason not to do it now. - Look out the window, please. - I know my own view. Just do it, please, I'm not alone. The van on the left. Do you know how long it has been there? It's not a plumber, you know. Damn it, it's Hamre. Get everyone out now! Go! Hamre asked me to give you a message. - Stay away from Lisa Halle. - I'll see you some other time, Veum. Is this about the girl? - The girl is called Lisa Halle. - Oh yeah, excuse me, is she in there? No. - So what the hell are you doing here? - I'm doing my job. You're about to ruin the case I've been working on for years. Not everyone have time to wait for years. If that girl hurts herself or anyone else it's your responsibility. - I've got DNA, I've got fingerprints. - Don't touch me. She's got motive, she doesn't have an alibi. Those kids had a relationship. You're protecting a murderer, Veum. Come on then, come on. Do something stupid now. Bloody amateur! Why did you go to Copenhagen, anyway? You can tell me. If you want to. I was meeting my boyfriend. What's his name? Peter. Was he in Copenhagen, too? - I was supposed to meet him that day. - The day you ran away from home? But he didn't answer his phone. I won't tell anyone, Lisa. Hey! We agreed to one glass. I'm allowed to do it at home. Lisa, we agreed, one glass. Where are you going? - What are you doing? - Nothing. Dear colleagues; new and old. I have the pleasure of welcoming you all to this last negotiation meeting. Hopefully the last. - Good afternoon Mrs. Halle. - Has the meeting started? Yes, they started about ten minutes ago. You can't go in there! All marriages are about giving and taking. And in that way our marriage is very unique. - Vigdis? - I'm sorry about the interruption. It seems we are not the only ones who are excited. Is something wrong? Have a seat outside with Vesla... ...or anywhere you want. Where was I? Yes. Two banks, rich in traditions - - and with a common ancestry. We'll wait a little with that one. I'll tell you a little bit about Manager Halle. Don't trust him. - He'll fuck anything that moves! - What the hell are you doing? Vigdis? He knocked up the neighbour's wife. Ignored his son for twenty years. Right up until he could use the boy. He used his bastard son for insider trading - - to make money off this damn merger. That's a lie, Vigdis, a lie. 18,500 stocks and now his son is dead. He has been killed. He was only a child. This is the man standing before you. And you want to do business with him? God damn it. God damn it! Yes, right... I think we'll have a short break. Let's say ten minutes. Hey. Let me have a look. Who has done this to you? Was it Lisa? - I thought she had... - Yes, but it wasn't the case, OK? Where is she now? She ran out, she was scared out of her wits. I'm sorry. I had no right to drag you into all of this. What's your problem, Varg? You seem totally out of balance. It's not your responsibility. She is a threat to other people's lives. - She did not kill Peter Werner, OK? - How do you know that? Sometimes you just know things. That gut feeling is going to get you killed one day. - Other people make her dangerous. - Yes, including you! Is it Lisa you are so worried about? Or is it your ego? Two suitcases. Not much after 23 years is it? - No. - I can call you when I'm there. Why should you? - Hi Lisa, it's so good to see you. - What's happening? - This is nice, whose is it? - Where's dad? - Dad is not coming tonight. - Why not? Because I don't want him here. Is dad moving out? Yes. Lisa, sweetheart, there. It's better this way, I promise you. I'll explain everything to you. Listen, go take a shower. Change your close, and then we'll have a bite to eat. Tonight I only want it to be the two of us. Then we can have a good long talk. Yes, hello? Is this Niels Halle? - Varg Veum speaking. - Oh, It's you. - Has Lisa contacted you? - No, Is she not wlth you? - No, she has run away. - What has happened? To be honest, I'm afraid of what she might do. Where are you now? I'm sorry about all the mess. I'm packing my things. - I've been kicked out. - What happened? Vigdis. She's what happened. She barged in here in the middle of the meeting and made a horrible scene. She told all the partners that Peter had bought half a million worth of stocks. 18,500 stocks. And that he was my son. - And that I had in some way... - Inside trading. And suddenly I was a leper. All the things I've made here, all the assets I've created. How did Vigdis know about Peter's stocks? That it was half a million. - How many stocks it was? - I don't know. What was your wife's relationship to Peter? He was the neighbour's son, a very normal relationship, as far as I know. - What happened the day Lisa ran away? - I wasn't there. Lisa had tried to set the house on fire, but luckily nothing happened. Where did the fire start? - In which room? - In our bed. Mine and Vigdis'. That's why we redecorated. Imagine, trying to set the house on fire... Lisa was with Peter the night he was killed. Did you know that? - Yes, she sneaked out. - Why didn't you call the police? Or me? Vigdis went out to look for her. - She didn't have any luck, obviously. - Just Vigdis? Yes, I had to work with the merger. I didn't have the time. I wasn't there. Vigdis took care of it. - Is she at home now? - Yes. Here you go. Isn't this cosy? Now we can talk a little. Oh, look what I did. Do you think I'm pretty? Yes you are very pretty. That blouse looks much better on you than on me. - And the necklace? - Oh, yes that too. Very nice. Peter liked this necklace, too. You can have it, if you want. All that is mine is yours, you know. No, not everything. Not Peter. Yes, him too. You're an old lady. It was me he wanted and I loved him. I, too, loved Peter, Lisa, in a way you probably won't understand. But you have dad. Dad and I don't have anything. We haven't had anything for many years. Everything is just a lie. I've been hard and cold, almost dead on the inside. Until I met Peter. He woke something up in me I thought was no longer there. I saw you together, in the bed. I know, I gathered as much. Lucky you didn't burn down the whole house. You were supposed to be in school. - You were never meant to... - You shouldn't have! You! Listen to yourself! I hate you. I've taken care of everything. Neither Peter nor Niels will stand in our way now. Lisa, you have to call me as soon as you hear this message. It's important! Damn it! I think I know who killed Peter. Peter was so nice. You know how good he could be. But he was dangerous. I saw what he was doing to you. And what was that? For every day that went by I saw that you were becoming - Hard, cold, doped. I'm a grown woman, Lisa. - I could handle him. - What did you do? I went down to the hotel to talk to him. That was where we normally met. - I only wanted to talk to him. - What did he say? He didn't want me anymore. He only wanted you. Only you, he said. You had talked, you loved each other. Did he really say that? And no matter what I said, he... We made love, but it was just sad. Then I understood. I understood that I was never going to win and that all I could have was a glimpse. You are so beautiful. You have your whole life ahead of you. Of course he wanted you. Did you kill him, mum? It was for your sake, too. I didn't plan on it. It was all so fast. There was a knife there on a plate. I took it... I stabbed him. First in the stomach, then his crotch. One more time. One more time. Hello? Lisa? - Are you OK? - Yes. What are you doing here? - Is your mother here? - Yes. Where is she? - Can I talk to her, please? - Yes, relax, she is here. - Well, where then? - She in here, in my room. Yes they are redecorating their own bedroom. - Mrs. Halle? - Lisa! Listen to me! Lisa! Open the door. Lisa? - Come on! - Shut up! Lisa! Lisa! What are you doing? Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Come back here! Help! Let me talk to your mum. Lisa! Haakon! Vera! Help! - Haakon! - Mamma! Haakon! Mamma! Help! Au! Lisa! Lisa! Let me in! Vigdis! Stop the car! Lisa, wait! Help! Lisa! Help! Lisa! Vigdis! Can you walk? Walk towards the house. - Just go! - Get out of my way! - Lisa! - Go away! - Walk towards the house. - Get out of my way! I'll kill you! Lisa? Lisa... Let me have a look at you. Are you hurt? Where are they taking mum? - They are going to take care of her. - Where? The hospital first, then the police. I'm scared. - I understand. - Do you ever get scared? Yes, I was scared out of my wits when you were about to run me down. - Why didn't you move? - I hoped you were even more scared. - You'll be seventeen soon, won't you? - Yes. You can have a life now that is just yours. - Do you understand? - Maybe. Maybe is not so bad. Actually maybe is pretty good. Are you proud of yourself now? You've ruined a car, a leg and two families. Not bad for a day's work. I only did what I had to do. I'm sorry you didn't get to be there. But I'm not going to wait the next time either. The Mink has shut down his business. Damn it, you must have scared him off. - I assume that's a good thing? - Well, yes. Only now it is going to be so horribly difficult to get a hold of him. And to think I was so close. Is that where you were?
