It would be a shame if we don't give at least a 1000 rupees, right? If you have, give me! 1000 rupees? What's this? Such a shame this would be, right? Either you give this Or as usual, borrow it from someone. Gives 300 for 1000! What was the use raising such a child? 36... 16... 10... So that's gone too... Here comes the teacher... Does not have even a 1000 rupees. In the Gulf It's with all my hard earned money, That I conducted her wedding. Now when I asked a 1000 rupees... She doesn't have, it seems! Didn't I tell a thousand times that I don't want this wedding... I too had it. That I wanted to study and earn a living. Nobody has time to listen to all of that. You have a son too, right? How come he does not have to know a thing? Instead of sticking to the marriage that you were in, You have come back! Huh! One can't have any peace of mind. Don't take it to heart, child. Go inside and have some tea. It's all there! Where did you manage to find these? How hard can it be if one's resolute about it. Hey! I'll tell you one thing. There's some 10 to 30 days to the exams. If you put your mind into it, you can be saved. Got it? - Pick up your book. - Ah! Chapter 4. Geopolitics. The geopolitics between America and USSR... Is what we are going to learn in this chapter.

We could go... But! Don't tell anything about studies to mom. Will see... Christy! Try this? Uncle! This is super! This is only because you both are here. Otherwise, this is not regular here. - Uh, Pappa! Pour some more - I had met Joseph bro... He told everything. Now you just mind your business. If a good proposal comes, it can be dealt with then. Oh no! I don't need anything anymore. Don't think about it now. Let this stage pass. Pappa! Pour some more curry... Will this work? You heard about his latest tantrum!? He wants a new bike, it seems! Really? Yeah! Give him that too, now! I had been to your wedding. It really was a fancy wedding. That's what I am suffering right now. Does Joy bro not send you any money at all? Truth be told, he has to be sent money. He and Pappa are the same! May I ask you something? Why did you come back so soon after the wedding? Heard that he used to hurt you a lot... Was he sick? You have only this to ask? Hey! Look at that! That's some lady... Hey! Hey! That lady! Calling! - Hello? - Who is it? I will call after a while, ok? Yesterday we saw...

This is the girl who scored the highest marks in Kanyakumari district. Christy Joseph! In this Tamil Nadu, they hand out marks like freebies, right? Buzz off! But you look super, this way. Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths En wrought... With golden and silver light The blue and the dim And the dark cloths of night And light And the half-light, I would spread the cloths under your feet But I, Being poor, Have only my dreams I have spread my dreams under your feet Tread softly... Because you tread on my dreams... Here! 35... 36... 37... 38... Oh ok! Here! The front tyres are new. I haven't shown it in the bill. - Ok! - Then, what about the back ones? Let's pray... Ok!

Listen, what if we go? This friendship of yours is my only respite, now. "Every breath..." "Is it just you?" "In it, each and every moment..." "Is it you that breathes life into!?" " Is this life of mine, a wild ocean?" "And you..." "A voyager upon it?" "This solitary little life of mine..." "Is now engulfed by the magnificent wave that is you!" "Each and every word..." "Are they melliflous notes of music?" "Each and every touch of yours..." "Are them, burning bliss!?" "At night, you are the galaxy..." "During days, you turn into the blue, white ocean!" "You are everything!" "It's only you in my sight!" "Other than your form, everything seems to have been wiped off from memories." "Have you reached riding the wave of life..." "Oh dream voyager..." "This solitary deep waters of my being" "Is engulfed by the magnificent wave that is you!" "The illusion of silence..." "that comes undone by the play of music by our bodies..." "Is heard by the seas..." "What is heard, is the insatiable..." "Sound of delicate ark of music; and the rows on the other hand..." "It carves the romantic sighs of water!" "Many oceans needs to be crossed" "By us in the ark of time..." "To reach the unseen..." "Deep waters of love..." "Each and every look of yours..." "Is the cloud of blind, passionate love" "In it," "Each and every moment" "Is the lightning passion of your eyes!" Communication! For every triumph, no matter if it is... Career... A teamwork... Or a relationship, Communication is very very important. Only if what's inside is spoken, Can the other person know. The existing problems... needs to be talked freely... Whoever does the right communication becomes the winner! Are you sitting and thinking about her? Man! Go tell her. What if she considers me a mere brother? Only she can clear that up. You first go and tell her the matter. If you don't tell her, you will end up here staring at the waves. Just buck up and go tell her. That's what I have also been thinking. In the middle of the ocean, in some strange country... To even think of sending her alone... Don't you have anything to say? My dear grandma, first, let the interview be done. This hue and cry needs to be made only if I get the job, right? This has to be some scam. Why would the interview be in Palakkad, instead of Trivandrum or Thrissur? Can Pappa come with me or not? If not, I will call him to go with me. What's this for? Don't even get me started, got called for an interview in Palakkad. For the vacancy of a teacher in Maldives. This hue and cry is all for that. In Maldives!? Yes! Are you in the class? Yes... So, the Maldives interview date has come. Next Wednesday, at Palakkad. Pappa has told me he will come. But, it will be boring with him. You also come. Just for company... Ok! Alright then! Next Wednesday! Sreelakshmi!? How was it? No idea. Waste of money! Come! Let's eat something. Come! - You want? - No! Let's go!

I was there for about 4 years. - Thought of repeating this year. - How is it there? It is a beautiful place. There are about a 1000 islands. But which atoll do we end up in, can only be found out once we reach there. And there is no entertainment and nothing is available there to buy. Everything needs to be brought from here. The only comfort is that, the salary is great. The money for the agency needs to be paid in person? No, it just needs to be deposited into their account. Once we pay, we can go within two weeks. - Hey, is it trustworthy? - Sure! Mali Government runs it directly. - Ok! All the best! - Thank you! - All the best! - Sir! Excuse me... - By when should we pay this? - In one week. So then, travel details? Once the payment is made, All details will be called and informed to you from the office. Alright! Malini!?

Those who want to have tea, may do so now. You coming? Hey! What is it? There is something I wanted to tell... Tell me. Are you going? How do I not go! Hey... I really like you. But I like you too! Not that way... I would like to marry you. What's this! This damn rain! Hey! Did she not say anything? When is she leaving? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Ask her and find a closure to this. About what? Whether she likes you or not! Do you feel this wind? I don't have to keep asking her if she likes me. Her liking. I understand it. Wherever she goes, it will stay that way. Give it one more round. Otherwise it will leak. - That 'murukk... - Try keeping it here.' Two more packets of 'murukk should be there.' There was so much of space left. If the weight increases too much, they will charge for it - Ah, close it! - Here! Hey... I am leaving. - Tomorrow what time is the departure? - Around 6. Hey! Tomorrow you should also come to the airport... No! What is it? Hey! I'm on my way to the airport. I'll call once I reach there. The number you are calling is switched off.

If there is fuel, we can go wherever. How much of fuel will be required? - That - Just buzz off, yo! It won't be Male like this boy says. It will be some other island!

There is a friend there. Is there ship that goes there? None from here. From Sri Lanka, there is. What about from Lakshdweep? From there? Lakshadweep? I had seen in a movie. Boy, that is cinema. There is a direct flight. If you pay 15k, it'll include return ticket too. Isn't that enough? So return ticket also needs to be booked? Without return, they won't allow you to go there! Just to board from the airport, they will ask for the hotel stay details. It will cost a lot. Else, you will need some sponsorship or shizz like that. Sponsor!? That means, Someone working there. Or else, aren't there many Male people roaming around in our city, right? They are also enough. Is there anybody like that? Is there? - Hello Kiran! Hi! - Sir! Hi! Hey! What's he like? My father has been giving him vehicle for rent for 4 years now. There is no problem. He is a good person. If it's possible for him, he will definitely help.
