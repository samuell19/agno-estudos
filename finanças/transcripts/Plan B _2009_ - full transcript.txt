Nice guy her boyfriend. Photographer, I believe. That was what really bothered me. While he was speaking, she couldn't help laughing. - I can't remember why you left her. - I don't know. I got bored. She called me to talk about you six months after you broke up. If you wanted she'd get back with you. That was the original plan. It's fine meeting up from time to time but I'm never getting back with you. Don't even dream about it. It won't ever happen. Don't you understand the word "never"? - Are you in love with him? - Yeah, I guess... At least he isn't crazy like you. He has other interests. You will end up with me. You are such a fool. You want to get back with me because I'm dating somebody else. - Someone more handsome than I. - No, he's not. See? I'm more handsome. You're going to end up with me. Goodbye, handsome. She doesn't want to come back. What now? Not sure, I think he slept with a guy once. I did think he was a fag. But he's not. I believe he is very open-minded, he tried different things. It's OK, isn't it? Being able to be with another guy... To try, without prejudice, and to speak to others about it. Think about it. So I came up with Plan B. No... You're kidding. I don't believe you. - Really? - Yes. - Do you watch Blind? - Yes, I'm a huge fan. I can't believe it. I never miss an episode. Never! I'm missing it today because my TV is dead but I never miss it. - Really! - Of course! I don't know any other fan, serious. I can't believe it. - My girl doesn't let me watch it. - Why? - She says I get obsessed with it. - Because it's very good. So good. I can't believe you watch it... Nobody understands it... No. It's true. - I tape all the episodes. - Do you? Could you lend me tonight's episode? You don't even know me but, in spite of everything, can I borrow it? - Yes. - Cool! - You could come watch it at my place. - Today? OK... Yes, sure. If you invite me. What do you mean by "in spite of everything"? - Excuse me? - You said: "In spite of everything". Because I don't know anybody here at the gym and I was being friendly when I saw the chance of watching Blind. I don't know... What? The way you're obsessed with this show reminds me of how it drives me crazy. It's very good... - I'm going home. - Really? Why? Because. I'm going home. Don't you have to watch a film for class? Yes, but you can watch it with me. It's the last episode, I must see it. Please. - You're going to use the TV, aren't you? - Yes. Besides, we each have our own place, our own things... don't we? - Come on, I must watch it. Give me a kiss. - "I must watch it". - It makes me jealous. - You're jealous about a TV show? I am. But you are my only love. Give me a kiss. - Goodbye. - Bye. Come in. Something to drink? - All I have is water... - OK. Are you French? Why? Because of my accent? Or because of my features? - Why French? - It's nothing. My girlfriend has a photo of a French guy in her house that looks just like you. It's uncanny. When I saw you at the gym I thought you looked just like the guy in Laura's photo. That's why I stared at you in the gym. The French guy... I thought... Hey, it's about to start. Son of a bitch! They can't end it like this. I can't believe it! Now we'll have to wait four months. Hey! Just two weeks. - Who was that guy? - The contact. - No. No way. - I can't believe it! Fuck... - Good episode. - Yes. Well, I'm leaving. Today we can watch it again thanks to my girlfriend. She has to study and she's using the TV. Did you send yours to be fixed? - You mean my girlfriend? - Your TV set. Yes. - We can meet on Tuesday. - Sure! Sure... Do you have a girlfriend? No, I don't. I sent her to be fixed and they kept her. She was useless. And when we saw the moon, we went crazy and started howling like wolves. We all climbed a hill, 20 metres high, and when we got behind the hill we were facing the moon. It was... You know... The clouds were... like horses. Incredible. Hey, look how cool the light is. It's true. What time is it? - Around 6am, right? - It's great light for pictures. You're right. I'll be right back. - Let's see. - Take a picture. - Come on! - No, I'm ashamed. I don't have another model now and the light is perfect. But these photos are for you. Please don't show them to anybody. Yes, yes. - OK, that's enough. - Let me see, come on. It's very nice. Let me take one of you. - That one too. - This one. - No. I don't like it. - What? You took like 25 pictures. - No, I don't like it. - Come on! Give me the camera. - Do you know how it works? - I press the little button. - And with this you can... - Yeah, yeah... I can do it... - Take it. - OK. Here we go. - Can you see the light? - Yes, the light is perfect... Look. - That's nice. - Yes, it is. It came out nice. - You're staying, aren't you? - Yeah, sure. - Let's go. - OK. Bruno, over here. I'll bring you a shirt. Thanks. - OK, good night. - Good night. The other day someone took photos of me. - They are really cool. - Send me one. No, you threw them all out, screw you. You're such a prick, so cocky. - Didn't you keep at least one? - No. If you get back with me, I'll give you all the ones you want. We are not getting back together. - Sometimes I feel bad about Pablo. - You mean your boyfriend? What happened? Doesn't he keep an eye on you? No, neither do I. We trust each other. When we were together, did you see other guys? You know I didn't. Well... once. With you it's different, because I don't feel guilty. What are you thinking about? Your boyfriend. - These are cool pictures. - Yes, they are. I don't understand how Laura didn't see them. He doesn't like to show his photos to anyone. He showed you, why not show them to his girlfriend? He said he wouldn't. If she sees them, fine. We have to take risks. Poor guy. He's putting his trust on the wrong side. - And that's you. - That's life. That's life. Did you touch it? No, but I saw it at the gym, and it's a good size. Really? Well, aren't you a lucky faggot. You're such a faggot. Give me some water. Who's that guy? My boyfriend, do you like him? You're an asshole. Come on, is he your friend or Victor's? He's my boyfriend, really. - Why, do you hate gays? - You're a moron. - He's cute. - Beautiful. Don't try to steal him. Pablo, this is Ana. Ana, this is Pablo. - Hi, how are you? - Fine. She doesn't believe you're my boyfriend. Well, no need to shout about it. I don't know your friend, I'm a little embarrassed. So how did you meet? - At the gym, in the shower. - Yes. I saw him showering close to me, and I got a chubby. That's gross. Come on, you like it. - How big can it get if it's so small? - What? Your sister showed me a naked picture of you. I don't know what it does otherwise, but with me it gets pretty big. - Have you seen it? - I haven't had the pleasure. Dude, it looks like you really are boyfriends. We are boyfriends. Let's see, kiss him. Bruno is not feeling it. It still embarrasses him. He's man enough to say he has a boyfriend but he's too much of a pussy to kiss him. Don't harass me, bitch. he's the one that's embarrassed. Yeah, sure. With that game you'll end up kissing for real. - We really are boyfriends. - So kiss him. He can just suck my dick too, right? - Hey, slow down, we just met. - OK, fine. - Anyway, I would love to see it. - What a slut. Why, you think I'm not? Watch. Come on, kiss me my love. You're really a couple. What, am I a prick? He's beautiful. I'm getting a little horny. I need a drink. - Nice girl. - Yes. Man, I haven't laughed like this in ages. - I'm off for more booze. - OK. What the fuck? Do you know what was cool when we were kids? I didn't have them but my cousin did, Rastri. Rastis. - "Rastris", not "Rastis". - I thought it was "Rastis". No, it's "Rastris", you think "Rastis", but it's "Rastris". OK. - We should look it up. - OK. - They were cool. - Yeah. - I used to build structures. - Structures? Yeah houses, planes, stuff I imagined, whatever I wanted. No, man! What toy would you be, if you could be one? The corny moment has arrived. If I were a toy... - I don't know, I never thought about it. - I would be a View-Master. The one where you look, and you flip the pictures... - Yeah, with a button. - Yes. - That's a good one. - Yeah. For people to understand you, they have to see through your eyes. I see you in 3D, for example. So that's why you'd be a View-Master. Cool. Come on, what would you be? I don't know. A toy bucket and shovel. - A toy bucket and shovel? - Yes. I'm a much less sophisticated toy. True, how much do a toy bucket and shovel cost? - I don't know... 20 pesos. - 20 pesos? Why a toy bucket and a shovel? Because you can fill it with things... and build stuff... I don't know. It sounds good, very poetic. - Can I buy it? - I have an owner. What a lousy businessman I am to not know that. I want to lie... I mean buy you. I wanted to buy you for 20 pesos. Here, I got it. Give it to me. - I'll keep the 20 pesos. You loose. - No, I win. Done. Peter Pan. You know him, right? - He's the one that flies. - Peter Pan, man, Peter Pan. - The one who flies. - Yes, that one. - Do you know where he lives? - No. You don't know where he lives? - Never... - Neverland. - Neverland. - Right. - Tinkerbell lives there too. - Yeah, Tinkerbell. - The problem is "Neverland"...never... - "Never" means never... - And "land"? - Piece of land. Yes, it could also be "to land" and that is the problem. Do you understand? I see it as the place where you never land. That's the question, if Peter Pan never lands in Neverland... - it doesn't exist. - You're right. It doesn't exist and Peter Pan doesn't exist. It's right in the name, it doesn't exist. Do you follow me? The guy never landed there, you never land in that country. You get it, right? Yeah, I get it. So during our whole childhood we were living a lie. I just figured it out. - Neverland... - Son of a bitch, Peter Pan. Son of a bitch. I'm furious. It's like it ruins childhood, kind of... - When did you discover this? - Just now. - It's true. - He never landed, son of a bitch. - Is he dead? - Yeah... but alive it's really huge. He's all dick and no brains, but I'm happy anyway. - He used to be my sister's boyfriend. - Him? Yes. Whores, you're both whores. - Me, a whore? - You're a whore. You chickened out at the party. If you had given him a real kiss, I would have bought it. But you gave him a little one. Do you want me to give him a snog? He'll beat me up. He's dying to do it. Right? Yeah, yeah... See? Come on. Kissing a guy doesn't make you gay. Sometimes I kiss girls. It drives the boys crazy. Why don't you kiss him? No, I have a girlfriend. - That's OK, but you're next. - Sure. I want to. No, don't be a cheater, kiss him. Why with me? Come on, kiss him, it won't kill you. She's right. She kissed me, I could end up in jail. If my boyfriend wakes up he'll kicks your ass. Don't tempt me, you'll lose... - Well, only for the girl. - Go on, he's asking for it. - It's OK. - I'm not asking for it. - Bruno don't be a bitch. - I'm trying not to. You did the same thing at the party. OK, come on. - I'm gonna touch myself. - You pervert. See, no big deal. I'm going with the dead guy. - They're asleep. - Yes. Let's go to sleep. You're staying, right? - Let's go. - Sure. Remember when we were kids, like 12 years old, and you invited a friend to sleep over and turned off the light, and stayed up for hours talking. So true, that was great. You know what would be great? To go back to the past with a tape recorder, and record those conversations. Damn. The way we see the world at this age... Let's go to the movies one of these days. Sure. Where did that come from? I don't know... free association. - Good night. - Good night. Where are the pictures that were here? They were old, I threw them out. I liked those pictures, they were cool. You could have asked me. Honey, it's my place. Let me decorate it how I want. Fine, but some of my stuff is here too. It's half my house. My girlfriend threw out the photo of your double. - Why? - I don't know, she went mad. Did you tell her he looks like a friend of yours? No, I didn't talk to her about you. I like to keep my friends by my side, and her... I don't know, things are good with you... like you were saying, our friendship is like from when I was 12 years old... and you don't want to share your friend. I don't know... I would feel weird... taking you to her place, seeing you two chatting. It seems strange, I don't know. At least here, I have my space. - Does that make sense? - Perfectly. - Are you staying over? - In your bed? Don't laugh, Mariano locked the door and took the key. - You want to be close to me. - No. Yes, you do. I'll be fine on the floor, it's all good. Seriously, you can stay in my room. OK, fine. - Well, let's have some wine. - Yes, that would be great. Oh! I can't find my wallet, could it be at your place? No. I can't find it anywhere. Well, I don't know... - I'll go get the wine. - OK. - What are we waiting for? - Ana. She is fucking her boyfriend downstairs... I have a present for you. Very cool! You're great... Cool. I've already bought one, though. Don't you remember? For 20 pesos. A much nicer one. Now I have two beach buckets and two shovels. But I'm there. That's why I'm giving it to you. And I take the chance. - If you were... - If I were what? I really like your "if you were..." quizzes. Very corny. I know... If you were a... - No... I won't tell you. - Come on! Come on! A mineral. I don't know, a mineral, anything but an animal or a human. A mineral... - Good question! - You don't have to answer... - Water. - Water? Water is OK. I would be sand. - Get it? Sand, the bucket... - Sand, that's OK. What are you doing here, you homos? Is anything wrong? Are you angry? Didn't he fuck you? - You're out of toothpaste. - Ah... maybe... Look at me for a second. Who do you think is taller? Wait. Stand still. Stand still. I'm taller, you midget. Don't smoke here. Well... you were saying... - Do you want some chewing gum? - No, thanks. Go ahead, take the last one. I need to ask you a favour. I'm going for an audition. An audition? Come on! How long have you been doing this? It's something silly. They called me for a commercial. They chose me from a picture. They'll pay 12 thousand pesos. They're shooting it in Ecuador for Iceland. - Really? - Yes... but I have to kiss a guy and don't know what to do. The other day you were drunk and you kissed me. I was drunk. Are you kidding? You are kidding. It's one thing giving a little kiss or fooling around drunk. - Don't mistake it for the little kiss. - I'm not mistaking it. Besides, you don't know the favour I'm going to ask you. - To kiss you so you can practice. - No. Yes... Just go and kiss him. It's weird kissing each other so you can practice... I would do it, because you're my friend. Even to try without being drunk. It's easier to go over there and just do it. But you would do it. It's easy for me to convince you, isn't it? You really must like me... I'm just joking. Come on, give me a kiss. I would. Because I really like you as a friend and I know... It's just because of prejudice, I don't... Yes, sure. As a favour. I don't remember the other day. No... I consider you my friend. Imagine that I kiss you in a different way and you think... I'm a fag. I lose you as a friend. You're wrong. I'm not crazy. I'm asking you since I know nothing is going to happen. Otherwise I would be the fag... I'm the one who's asking. You kissed me once. Are you going to tell me that you can't do it again? And then what? Are we going to get used to it and spend the afternoon making out? Maybe... This is silly. Come on, let's do it. It's a lot of money. I can't believe I kissed a guy. You better not tell anybody about this. And you'll have to kiss another guy. You are kissing a lot of other guys lately. Why other? - At the audition. - Yes... yes, yes. It's weird. Isn't it? I've never kissed a guy. It's the second time and with the same guy. Didn't you ever kiss another guy? Don't lie to me. I've just done it with you. Why would I lie? I imagined something else. What? Didn't you ever have something with a guy? - Did you? - Yes. But you said you had never kissed a guy before. I tried other things without kisses. When I was younger. It's OK. I didn't, I never thought about it. - I didn't have the chance either. - You're lying. OK, don't believe me. Whatever. Liar. Son of a bitch. - Is everything all right? - Yes. Are you sure everything's all right? You look weird. No, I'm fine. - Are you OK? - Yes. This is for you. Open it later. - Thanks. - Hey... I don't know what's wrong with me. I love you, man. I want you only for myself. Tell me... - Are you seeing someone? - No. No, I'm not cheating on her. At least for now... That's why I told her we should take a break. My head explodes and I need to know what I want. Take it easy. I care about you. You can be honest with me. Do you remember once I told you I had been with a guy? - It wasn't true. - Stupid. I didn't. I never was with a guy. I lied. But I guess it appealed to me in some way. Now I'm a bit confused with a friend I met not long ago and I need to know what happens with this. - I don't want to hurt anybody. - Of course not. It's OK. Take your time and see what happens with this guy and with Laura, and take it easy. Anyway, whatever you do won't change what should be. - And what about her? - What? - Is she seeing someone? - Yes. Don't feel bad, she's been seeing a guy for a long time. With an ex, Bruno. She has a picture of him in her house, but... she didn't tell you because she didn't want to make you jealous. On the wall, where she has all those pictures... The guy is crazy, obsessed. He wants her back. Bruno? The one who's with the eyes closed, against a wall? - No. - With a beard... No that's Paul. The French guy. Bruno is the first one. The one with the "Paul" sign. The names are changed. I didn't know that the names were changed. Don't tell her that I told you because she'd kill me. No, I won't. - So, that's Bruno. - Yes. He knows who you are. Once he saw you with her and called me to ask who you were. He wanted to kill himself because he saw you together. - Want some tea? Camomile? - Whatever... Be right back... I'm sorry. I need to be by myself for a while. I didn't mean for this to end up like this, but... I'm not well. I'm not the right person for you. I'm sorry. - I'm seeing someone, anyway. - What do you mean? I don't mean to be resentful. I don't know why I'm telling you this... I don't know... I guess it hasn't been working... Who is he? An ex-boyfriend. Well... I'm gonna go. How are you? Confused by the letter, aren't you? Sorry. It wasn't the idea. That's more or less what happens to me with you. Anyway, there is something in your letter which I don't agree with. I mean... If the sex would be... half as awesome as it is... awesome as it is... or, I mean, was kissing you... You made up this crazy excuse just to kiss me so... I want to try what I really feel... if we sleep together. All of a sudden? What could happen? It's between you and me. We are alone here. Are you proposing that we have sex? - Yes. - It's weird... Weird? You really think it's weird? Did you read the letter you wrote me? My head explodes... Come. Come on... I have to piss. I love you too... But I can't... We're going crazy... I don't like guys. I'm not gonna change, even if I try once. I'm sorry... Really, I am. I'm a bit shocked about everything, but I know I don't... we're not 12 years old. This is beyond my control. I pretend to be modern... but I'm old fashioned and... I have a girlfriend. Everything's... I don't know... fine, though. In the future... we can be friends. I'm single. You know? Single? What happened? - He left me. - He left you? Yes, he did. He met another girl. Another girl? Yes, he met another girl, and fell in love with her, I guess. That's bad. Do you still think of coming back with me? Sure. Yes. But, let's take it easy, OK? You've just broken up. Maybe you'll get back with him. I don't think so. How are you? Fine. The guy found out about the game. It's strange. Almost impossible. He took some pictures of you, didn't he? Maybe Laura saw them. Anyway, there is something I don't understand. All of a sudden, you like guys? I don't know Victor, I can't explain this. It happens. I hope this never happens to you... My head hurts. I spend all my time thinking and thinking. Tell him everything at once. The letter was confusing. Tell him you are crazy about him. If you let me choose, I would never choose her luck. Yes, I know, no one would. It's crazy. I don't want to think about that. How are you feeling? - Better? - Yes. I don't know. I can't be with you. I can't be with anybody. I felt jealous when I saw you with another guy but now that you're alone... I realise that I was jealous and I don't want to come back. It was great. But it's done. I'm sorry. I told him we were dating. Does the guy know me? Yes. I had a picture at home. I didn't throw them all. Then Veronica told him I was seeing you... Don't worry anyway. He left me. He's not gonna chase you and hit you. If I were him, I would hit my head. Do you exaggerate! - Hi. - How are you? I don't know how, it was in Javier's house. I wanted to give it to you. At Javier's? - Did you check it? - No, man! So, are you back together with Laura? No. Did you? No. - And why didn't you? - Because it wasn't right. Wasn't right? Yes, I'm not in love with her. So much trouble... And why didn't you come back with her? - Because, I got confused with you, I guess. - You got confused? I am sorry... OK... I just... Hey... I want to tell you something... I was asking around and... They are "rastri", remember? Not "rasti". What I really want to tell you is... that... that I'm in love with you. I'm completely sick. I don't know how it happened. I couldn't handle it. Look. Here, the 20 pesos from the other time. And did you see this? Come here, you retard. Let's see who's taller.
