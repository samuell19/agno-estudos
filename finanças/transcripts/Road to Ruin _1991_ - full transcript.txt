How are we doing? Man: I don't think we are going to make it. What? - I don't think we are going to make it. Woman: Tokyo's ready on three, Mr. Sloan. A little faith can move mountains, Julien. Put him on, Sarah. She's fine. Thank you, Jack. Great. 39-5 and falling. Okay. - Toshi, we buy at, uh... - You can't hit black at 3-5-5. Shipping is up and the export tax is squeezing the shit out of us. - At 3-5-5. - Okay, fine. What happened to, uh, that plant in Taiwan? - The Tong plant? - The Extor plant. We bought it. So we use the plastic for the hardware. We already got the microchips. We just scraped $10 million off the top. So now you can afford a new tie. Mr. Ruggert's on the line from Chicago. Tell him yes on the condos, no on the deep-dish pizza. I like mine crispy. Michaelson called. He's flying in from New York today. Meet him at the airport. Taking him for lunch tomorrow. - What about Kate Asler? - Cancel that. She's married. - Mr. Sloan, what about-- - Take five! Take five! Mr. Sloan. Johnny, get this to Sarah. Go. Did the Giants kick that field goal? Out of sight. Bonsoir. Allons-y, Gerard. Oh, uh, Gerard, here are the tickets you wanted to the Miles Davis retrospective. - Voila. - Oh, thank you, sir. Hmm. Where's the fire? Um, we're shooting in Milan tomorrow. I have got to catch that midnight train. - You didn't tell me. - Forgot. Didn't think it would matter. I thought-- I thought we were gonna spend the night. What? I said, uh, Milan is a nice town. It has great shopping. Here, the 13-D. I made a, can I just say, adjustment. And, um... Jack? Julien, how long have I lived in this town? Well, you should know. Um, 20 years. - 20 years? - Yeah. 20 years, I got no family. I got no real friends to speak of - except you. - Ah, cut the shit, huh? That's true. But, Jack, you've got a charmed life. Look around. Everyone in this city wants to shoot pool with Jack Sloan. Yeah, sure, they do, Julien. Because I own the table. I buy the drinks, I tell the jokes, I keep them happy. But believe me, if one of them called up Maxim's and said Jack Sloan eats shit on toast... the next day I'd be on the menu. You know it's not true. Julien, you know I know it's true and I know you know it's true. And everybody knows it's true. You're the only real friend I got because I can look you in the eye. And you can't look a man in the eye if he's kissing your ass. This has got, um, some style, don't you think? Kind of like Wayne Thiebaud's palette-knife stuff. I like the metaphor, the, uh, chromatic nuance. What I don't like is that fish in the rowboat. Don't you just hate it when the painting is only about the paint? It's all right. So that's a fish, huh? Yeah. I think so. What do you think of-- what do you think of the whole triptych? - It's too abstract. - Abstract. Well, abstract is all right. A lot of people buy this guy. Yeah, well, a lot of people buy whatever's fashionable whether they like it or not. Guilty. You bought this? Well, I guess the fish didn't bother you that much. That's a whale. Don't tell me you bought this one, too. God. You own this place or something? Well, yeah, actually. I'm Jack Sloan. Really? No blood. Well, uh, what kind of work do you do? Does it entail first-strike capability? Public relations. - You find that funny, do you? - Yeah. What do you do, bludgeon them to death with your sense of humor? Let's just say I work in a gallery a lot like this one, but I make the paintings look a lot better. - Oh, well, that's good PR. - Obviously. You're still here. - So are you. - Jack? Who's that? Now promise you won't make a scene. I promise. It'll be just like I'm not even here. Some people are waiting for you downstairs. Are they? Good night. Thank you for coming. Thanks a lot. - Thanks. - Yeah. - Did you like it? - It's great, yeah. - Good. - You have some good stuff. Let's have something, dinner or something soon. - Lunch. Then do dinner. - Okay. Okay. Please. Bye. - Bonsoir. - Bonsoir. Voila. - Hi. - Hi. Who's that? The, uh, art critic? That's Jessie Tailor. She's a model with the Tish Agency. - Hmm. - She's wonderful, isn't she? I'd recommend head-gear. Sarah, I need the numbers for the Tish Agency. - The modeling agency? - Yeah. For what year? Sarah, the phone numbers, not the financial numbers. Have we got a financial report for the Tish agency? Yes, sir. We own half of it. - We do? - Yes. Oh. I've been neglecting that part of the business lately. Jack: Well, apologize for me, Julien, because I have other fish to fry right now. - But, Jack, I-- - Well, then use the three-step approach. Tell him I've read the brief and the deal is on. Then take him to... and blow a lot of beaucoup bucks on him, and then... If he doesn't like that, let him eat cake. I gotta go. I'm taking a lesson in fashion, Julien. Man: Now, come on, come on. That's right. That's it. Not too fast now. Yeah. Yeah, th-that's right. Yeah. Careful, yeah. Slowly, slowly. Jessie, look out your eyes. Careful with your eyes, Jessie. Up, up! Now slowly. Up, up, up. On the neck, yeah. Now the neck. Yes, the neck is very... Now don't blink. Don't blink. Blink. No, no, don't blink! Don't! Cut! This take looks like shit. It is a total disaster. A nightmare! What happened, what happened? She's great. What was wrong with that? It's fantastic. What is it? Man: Women's perfume. Director: Go. Go! Okay, let's do it again. - Now, Jessie-- - What, the lion missed its mark? No, the lion was fine. Your eyes look like hell. Okay. - My eyes. - You blinked, Jessie. The-- the whole point with this thing is that you don't hear the lion. It does not exist. Can you comprehend that? - Yes. - It does not exist! There is not any lion. Got that? Marcus, what take are we on? - 37. - 37! Great. Where is my coffee? Oh, for Christ's sake! What in the hell is with that guy? He's the best in the business. He knows what he wants, and in the end he gets it. Yeah, why wait until the end? I'll give it to him right now. Thank you. Great. I see you can get in anywhere, Jack. Jack? You remembered my name? My heart, though abstract, be still, for it floppeth around like a fish in a rowboat. What are you doing here? Fred and I go way back. - Jack also happens to be-- - Ah, shh. Fred. Do you by any chance like classical music? Mozart? Yes, Jack, I like Mozart. And I also like long walks down country roads and margaritas at sunset and my list of turn-offs are fur balls and phonies. Well, look, would a couple of tickets to the Paris Opera Ballet production of "Magic Flute" be a turn-on? No, that gets filed under "Thank you, I'm busy." It's the Mozart, isn't it? All right, I'm flexible. Excuse me. Butthole Surfers, front row seats. - No. - Backstage passes. - Fully laminated all-access? - Yeah, dude. Let's get something straight, Jack. You know what I am? You're a model. No, I'm a woman. I work as a model. That's what I do. And all day long I stand around in front of a lot of guys with a lot of money and power. And somewhere along the line they get confused and they can't remember what they can buy and what they can't. So every once in a while I have to remind them that the products I advertise are for sale. I'm not. I think she likes me. Fred: You know she'll be in London tonight at the Dorchester. Oh, I don't know, Fred. Girls today. Goodbye. Take care now. - Don't say I never gave you nothing. - Hey, thanks. Okay, , Gerard. London? What the hell for? The pound is up, among other things. I'll only be a fax away. Mr. Boulet, Mr. Bendan is still waiting. Oh, for Christ sakes. Get him a-- just entertain him. - How? - Show him your new caf√© machine. Wait and see tomorrow. It's gonna be great. Absolutely wonderful. - Yeah? - Well, that's because of your beautiful hair. Oh, well, you know. You and my hair, I don't get it. You're so funny. Thanks, Stanley. I had a great-- I had a great time. Well, I-- I'd hoped that perhaps our evening together had just begun. Well, Stanley, you're-- you're a great guy, you know, and all, but we have an early call tomorrow-- I can push back the call time. I can do that. Jessie, honey. Honey, where did you put the pajamas? You know, the way you unpack a suitcase, I can never find a damn thing. - Good night, Jessie. - Stanley... - See you in the morning. - No, we-- look, this is not what it looks like. Hi. Who's that bozo? What the hell are you doing? I'm a business man. I'm here on business. Oh, same city, same hotel, same hallway? - Gee, what a coincidence. - I think it's a sign. Yeah, private, no trespassing, keep out. How about "beware of dog"? I couldn't sleep for all the whimpering coming from that wolfhound. How dare you call Stanley a dog when you're the one that's sniffing around and camping outside my room? Jessie, doesn't the word "kismet" mean anything to you? Haven't you stopped to consider that maybe all of this is a coincidence? That maybe, just maybe that you and I are mere puppets dangling from the invisible strings of destiny, guided through space and time by the unseen hands of fate? I mean, who are we to disobey the laws of the cosmos? You wanna mess with this karma? Good night. Goodbye. Good riddance. - Why are you so mad at me? - Because you're a pain in the ass! Okay, wait. Okay, okay. Okay, you win. Uncle. Man, I'm out of here. I'm history. I'm yesterday's headline, last year's hemline. You never have to lay eyes on me again. - Thank you. - Unless you're watching CNN. - Ugh! - Just one-- look, just one question, just one question, then I'm gone, I'm a ghost. What? I got-- got off on the wrong foot with you, didn't I? - Yes! - That's not the question! That's not the question. What I wanna-- what I wanna ask you is just what-- wha-- what did I do wrong? - How did I blow it? - For future reference? Yeah. Well, you know, I make a habit of learning from my mistakes. You are an overbearing, arrogant, vain, pompous, childish operator. - Don't hold back. - You're insensitive, insolent, d-disrespectful, cagey, sexist. You are a clueless, conceited bore. Really? Really. Well... look... I'm sorry I offended you. And, um... It's simple, really. I was just trying to get your attention. That's all. I meet a lot of transparent people and then... I saw somebody charming and authentic. I saw you. And I liked you. And hell is just as bright as that. I liked you. And you know what? Maybe that's what you're afraid of. Maybe... somewhere inside you, you really wanted to give me a chance. You're right, Jack. This is your last chance to get out of my life. Man, you gotta know when you're licked. Bonjour, Madame Barritou. Jack! How have you been? Oh, thank you so much. Oh, darling. - How have you been? - Oh, fine. But you have a little surprise for me? Here, look. Your favorite. Yeah, look, this is just a big coincidence. All right, big mistake. Uh, I've known this woman a long time. I come to this bakery. It's my favorite bakery in the world, and we'll keep it short and sweet. Little preventive maintenance. I recommend the raspberry tart. Au revoir, Madame Barritou. It's his favorite. Merci, madame. Jessie: May I join you? This table's a hell of a long way from being out of your life. You're gonna stay long enough to bum a cup of coffee off me? No, I'm staying long enough to buy you a cup. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Well, I don't want you to think that just because you're buying me this cup of coffee that you're buying me. I don't. And I also don't want you to think that I think that just because you're buying me this cup of coffee that I want or expect anything from you. I don't. Merci. Merci bien. Wanna share this? Gee. My favorite. How did you know? I didn't know it was your favorite. I was lost and I went into the bakery to ask for directions. What were you looking for? Gustave Moreau Museum. Yeah, it's beautiful. Well, you're not that lost. It's about five minutes from here. Do you think you could steer me in the right direction? Maybe? ...when I was a kid. - You grew up in Paris? - No, I grew up in Omaha. Omaha Beach? No, Omaha, Nebraska. I grew up in a foster home. About 20 of them, actually. I used to notch them on my belt. An orphan gunfighter. Yeah. When I was 17, I finally just ran away to New York. Hopped across the pond. Came to France. It was sink or swim and I didn't drown. So here I am. Jeez, and I thought my childhood was rocky. Oh, it all comes out in the wash, wouldn't you say? Must've been hard on you living alone for so long. Yeah, but I've been pretty fortunate. I mean, look at me now. I'm walking the streets of the most magical city in the world with the loveliest woman I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. I got a lot to be grateful for. - This is it. - This is it? Yeah. But look, I gotta go. And, uh, listen, don't forget to see Moreau's "L'Apparition" in the second room. It's got Salome in the corner, the seven veils. John the Baptist. You know it. I gotta go. Well, thank you. - Nice to see you. - You, too. Bye. In Paris, we do this. Don't you have to go somewhere? Yes. But I could get out of it. Get out of it. Ah! - Jack: Mm. - You're awake. Man: Voila! Voila. Don't ask. Mm-hmm. Oh, for me? Go ahead. Open it. Giorgio Armani, my favorite. The best. Try it. Try it on. Wow! Thanks. What's the occasion? Julien, - I'm in love. - Mm. - Did you hear me? I said, uh... - Yeah, you're in love. Yeah. Julien, love can be like, um, the perfect necktie. You know, you see it, it's beautiful, you want it, you... You wrap it around you and you tie the knot. - Know what I mean? - Do you hear yourself, Jack? Yeah, I just said it. Do you know how many times I've sat in this chair and heard you talk about women? Women, maybe, love, no. I-I've seen you with every beauty in town. Julien, I was younger then. That was window dressing. I was different, that was different, this is different, love is different. Julien, I'm in love. I met this woman the night the gallery opened. Uh, which night? Uh... Which gallery? Remind me, Jack. Julien! What's with you, man? I come in here celebrating. I may find the woman of my dreams. I may be happy the rest of my life. You sit there like a turd in a punch bowl. Hmm, and how much time have you spent with her? Three days... 16 hours, eight minutes, and... Three days, huh? Yes, and I intend to be with her forever. Use your head, Jack. Julien, come on. You know me. My head's here in my heart. Julien, where the hell would you and I be if we didn't take a risk once in a while? If we didn't take a shot? You're gonna love this woman, Julien. She's fantastic. She's fantastic. She's working in Rio for a week. She comes back, we'll have dinner together. We'll go to Tour d'Argent. We'll light up Notre Dame. She's beautiful, she's bright, - she's indep-- - And she has no idea you're worth $250 million? Nah, she doesn't care about that. Oh, how do you know? Julien, trust me. She doesn't care about that stuff. Oh, no, you said it yourself, Jack. When you own the table, it's easy to keep the guests smiling. I did say that, Julien. I did say that. And I remind you, you told me I was wrong. I was speaking as a friend. I'm also your financial advisor. Listen, when there is a beautiful woman across a pool table, we're not just talking a game with balls anymore. The stakes are higher. 250 million bucks higher. And you could be behind the eight ball. Woman: Oh, Jack, a silver fox. I love it. Jack, we're going to Tour d'Argent again? - It's beautiful. - Julien: You've got a charmed life. - Woman: Jack, I don't believe it. - Julien: Look around. - A Porsche? - Everyone in the city wants to shoot pool with Jack Sloan. Julien: She has no idea you're worth $250 million? Jack: Nah, she doesn't care about that stuff. Julien: How do you know? Jack: Julien, she doesn't care about that. Julien: Oh, no, you said it yourself, Jack. When you own the table, it's easy to keep the guests smiling. Thanks, Jack. Julien, what's the life span of a model? Uh, about 74 years. Like everybody else. - We gotta talk. - Yeah, we do. - I settled the dispute with the Hong Kong people. - Coffee. Coffee. Coffee. Ah, is this what true love does to a man? Maybe. Julien, what's the career longevity of a top cover girl? - Five years, give or take? - Hmm. Not much security in that, though, is there? No, but reading-wise, they're on top. Yeah, but what do you do when you're burnt out on the cover of "Vogue," but you're still too pretty for peanut butter ads and still too young for girdle commercials? Uh... - You marry a pop star. - Exactly! Uh, Jack, you're not Mick Jagger. No, but I'm rich. I can't rock and roll, but I got dough. Thank you. Julien, everything we do, everything... We do it like royalty. The opera, box seats, La Serre, beluga, Chanel, helicopters. She eats white truffles like popcorn. All your women have suffered your generosity, Jack. That's my point, Julien. That's my point! Look at me. I'm a walking game show. Win cash and prizes. And Jessie is no exception. I don't know. I don't know. She's gotta be. She must be. She's gotta be. I love her. I wanna spend the rest of my life with her, Julien. But you said it yesterday. That's the point. You said it yesterday. Does she love me or the cash? I gotta know. So... I've decided. I've decided. I'm going to lose it all. Lose it all? Well, not-- not lose, exactly. See, hide. We-- we drop a mask. We drop a cover over everything. Everything? Jessie gets back from Rio on Friday. By the time she gets back, Julien, every single thing I own has to be vanished. Gone with the wind. Everything? Everything, Julien. Every stock, bond, cash, banks, real estate. The Polish hunting lodge, the yacht in Monte Carlo, every pen, pencil, T-shirt. Everything gone. Uh, the Ferrari, too? Jul-- the Ferrari! Yes, the Ferrari. Everything, Julien! Can't we find something a little less dramatic? Julien, let's face it. Losing a couple of credit cards here ain't gonna hack it. I just can't fly coach instead of the G-4. She's gotta see it to believe it, Julien. I'm talking about rattling the tin cup in front of the drugstore, Julien. She's got to believe I've lost very single sou. She's gotta believe it and you gotta be clever about it. So? What do you think? Can you put the hat back over the rabbit? Mm, the international assets won't be a problem. All you have to do is transfer title. Your domestic assets, um, could be funneled into a blind trust. You'd have to sign some papers. But Harvey Schultz could blow the whistle. No, we don't tell Harvey Schultz. We don't tell anybody anything. Just you and me, Julien. But I need, um, maybe a new bank account for some emergency cash. We, um-- we put it under a code name, attach it to the trust. That's fine, yeah. So, I'm a pauper by Friday? On the road to ruin. - Merci. - Okay. Goodbye. - I've been waiting for you all night. - Jack? Yeah. Listen. Something's happened and we gotta talk. But you must have another bank account. We've been through this, honey. Everything is dissolved. The apartments and the cars and the helicopter? Locked up, all of it. Taxes. All your clothes, the companies? Look, I was leveraged to the hilt. The stocks went up for grabs. What wasn't already liquid was shut down or bought out or snatched up anyway. It's gone. All of it. You're taking this pretty hard. Pretty hard? Jack, I go to Rio for four days and I come back and you've lost everything that you've worked for! I don't understand. I mean, you worked so hard. You know, it's funny how we come to expect the simple things in life. A cup of hot chocolate. - I wonder when I'll have another one. - Would you stop it? You can have one any time you want. You're a very generous woman. Where are you going? - Well, I gotta go home. - Where? Oh, I got a cute little pad over in Vichy. Actually is pretty sweet. - I gotta go to work. - You got a job? Great! Yeah. I'm assistant manager at-- well, really, I'm a trainee at that, uh, new fast-food establishment Quick Burger. - Quick Burger? - Yeah. - You know-- - Jack, you gotta be joking. I lied about my bankruptcy on my r√©sum√©. I don't think I should've done that. What about your business contacts? Nah, they're vultures, Jessie. All of 'em. There's not a power broker in Paris, London, or Tokyo who wouldn't be happy to see me out on my ass. You know what, I made the laws more money in 10 years then they'll do in a lifetime. So let 'em enjoy the show. I've had mine. I can do just fine without 'em. Are you sure that's what you want? Sure, I'm sure. - Look, I don't wanna be a drag. - Please stay, Jack. I gotta be at work in an hour. I just want you to know something-- No matter what happens, I love you. And you're never gonna have to pick up my tab. You're never gonna have to loan me your car or pay the rent or buy groceries or pick up dinner. You got cab fare? Perfect. I'll show you it, then. And if you look closely, these very cobblestones are about as old as the French Revolution. As a matter of fact, they say that Robespierre used to live right around this area. Maybe right up that street back there. I'm gonna put a planter with roses along that building. And, uh, this is it. I don't know-- I don't keep the key. There's nothing to steal. Anyway, they say that, um, Charlotte Corday sharpened some knives right in this room. Yeah, watch your-- watch your head. I don't-- I don't have it like I want it right now. I mean, I don't have much to offer you. I think I got a piece of fruit. Would you like an orange? But, uh, I got a glass of, uh-- I just got a glass of water. Glass of water? Well... The bed is a little, uh-- a bit small, but we can have some fun. Don't you think? Listen, I know it's not what you're used to, but it's gonna have to do until I get back on my feet again. Why can't you stay at my place, Jack? No. I can't do that, Jessie. I got-- I got my pride, you know? So do I, Jack. What do you mean? I don't know. It just happened so fast, you know? And I just-- I think I really need some time to think about it, you know? I-- I think we both need some time to think about it. Yeah, I understand. So will you call me? Sure. - You promise? - Sure. Don't worry. We'll figure something out. Bye. Je-- Jessie! Hey, look, this is, um... What? Nothing. Bye. Woman: Jack Sloan, broke. So that's it. You know, it didn't even occur to me. What? Well, some other company bought the gallery from Sloan last week. And I couldn't understand why he was selling. He loves modern art so much. And he didn't even call me. I was just happy that the new owner kept me on to run it, that's all. Great, a new owner. Yeah, um, Joshua or something. No, Jericho. That's it, Jericho. I don't know what to say, Jess, um... Andrew's still at the bank. Do you want him to ask around for you or something? No. I don't know what to do. I can't believe it. Jack Sloan cut down like a beanstalk. Sorry. Okay. Man: Hey, Jack, someone's here to see you, man. Look, Jessie, please understand, now. There's been a gulf war. There's a worldwide recession going on. And, I mean, I think I'm pretty fortunate to be in line for this assistant manager's position. I mean, eight guys want this job. And Quick Burger's an up-and-coming company. They pay minimum wage, so there's a fast employee turnover. I mean, who knows? If I stick this out, I could-- I could make night manager in half a year, depending upon my boss Mr. McGurk's employee evaluation today. I don't understand, Jack. I mean, the money's one thing, but you're acting like you're happy here. What's wrong with this? A lot of people are happy here. Look around. Fine, but it's not you. Where's the big risk? Th-the "never say die" Jack Sloan that I fell in love with? Jessie, this is me. This is Jack Sloan. Maybe you didn't fall in love with me. I did fall in love with you. I am in love with you. - Hey, Sloan! - That's McGurk. I just wanna know what happened to the guy that built himself up from nothing. He's still here. This is just a different uniform. Hey, the men's toilet's backed up again. I'm not paying you to sit around and bullshit, okay? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Get a move on. I gotta go. Jack! Jericho. Can I help you, miss? Yeah, I was looking for the Sloan Corporation. This is Jericho now. Sloan sold the building a couple of days ago. So then Jack Sloan's no longer here? No, miss. Okay. Thank you. For you, Sloan. You got some weird friends, fella. "We know who you are. We know what you're worth. We've got your girl. Go home now. We'll call you later." - "We've got your girl." - Hey, what are you doing? You're burning the place down! Hey. Hey, come back! I'm talking to you. Hey, don't come back on Monday! You're fired. You stink! Open up! Jessie! Jessie! Shit! - Hello? Hello?! - Male voice: You're in the wrong apartment, Jack. - Go home now. - Yeah, I know, but what-- Hello? Hey. Hey! - Hello, hello. - Male voice: Hello, Jack. Look, who is this? What do you want? Where is she? She's with us. What do you want? We want $2 million for little Jessie "Angel Buns." How do I know you got them? I mean her? How do you think we got your number, Jack? Listen, um... Go to 12 Rue de Belleville, Chinatown. At 2:30 there will be a message for you in the dumpster. Hello. Hello? Hey! Hello? Freaking old French dial phones. Come on. Good afternoon. The Jericho Corporation. Yeah, Sarah, listen. It's Jack. I wa-- uh, I gotta speak to Julien. Mr. Boulet is in a meeting and can't be disturbed right now. Yeah, Sarah, it's Jack. - Look, I gotta-- - I'm sorry. I can't. Sarah! Lay off those freaking diet pills, Sarah. - Good afternoon. - Look, Sarah, it's Jack. Automated voice: Please enter your code number and amount now. I'm sorry, but your account is overdrawn. What? Hey. Hey. Hey! - Hey! Hey, wait your turn, buddy. Wait your turn. Where do you have the dumpster? Dumpster. Ah, voila. It ain't, uh, Mao, but, you know. Thank you. Thank-- thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, thank you very, very much. - Thank you. - I-I'll bring it back soon. Thank you. Bye. Oh, um... Do you have five francs? Um, metro ticket. Hey! Hey, hey, hey. I-I'm gonna talk to you. Julien, I need some help. I need to t-- You brought me another gift? What the hell happened here? Improvement. That's a matter of opinion. Go improve your own office. Listen-- This is my office. Where's my office? You don't have one. You need a haircut, Julien. You really need a hair-- get your feet off the desk! This is my desk, and if you put your hands on me again, I'll slap the taste out of your mouth. What was that, Julien? If you put your hands on me again, I'll slap the taste-- Listen! Jessie's been kidnapped and I need $2 million and I need it now! So if you get on the hotline of the Paris Bank with Bergman and tell him we need this money before I smell your breath again, - you might have a job-- - Is this man a problem, sir? Wait outside. I take care of this. You gotta tell me what's going on here, Julien, because it's really starting to piss me off. This was all so easy. You won't believe it. Try me. Well, last Tuesday morning, you signed a number of papers that transferred all your international assets to a new fictitious holding company called Jericho. No shit, Julien. That was my plan. Jericho was assigned a life span of one working week. Therefore, you could not get any money out of the bank. The account has been terminated as of today. - Terminated? - Yes. And redirected. Redirected where? To me. I'm the new director and the CEO of the Julien Boulet Alliance. We are going to make quite a splash on the exchange tomorrow morning. Oh, you might still catch her. Bobbie. - Bobbie: Schultz law offices. - Harvey Schultz, please. I'm sorry. Mr. Schultz is not available at-- Get him on the phone. Tell him it's Jack Sloan. Harvey: Jack, what the hell is going on over there? I've got a stack of notarized affidavits in front of me that basically bury you 10 feet in the ground. I'll be there in 10 minutes, Harvey. - I won't be here in 10 minutes. - You be there, Harvey. First law of business, Jack-- Never sign a paper you haven't read. No. First law of business, Julien, is know who your friends are. I spent 10 years watching you steer this ship. I saw you receive recognition. I saw you get women. I saw every damn break you needed go your way. If the breaks went my way, Julien, they went your way, too. You were closer to me than my own skin. Close wasn't good enough. Where was my shot at the big time? How long did I have to wait for my break? I've put my time into this business, Jack. I just want it back. Don't give me the humble servant bullshit. This is me you're talking to. You had everything you wanted here. You had a piece of this place and it made you rich. You had more fucking breaks than the Berlin Wall. You don't want your time back. You just wanna kill the king. But I got news for you, asshole. This ain't the French Revolution. Guard, please. Now you've got enough money to buy anything you want except the pride of having earned it, Julien. What about Jessie? I need $2 million. You want to test her? You got your wish. Invite Mr. Sloan to the sidewalk permanently. Now you know what it's gonna feel like to have a lot to lose, Julien. I hope you don't run into anybody like you. I'll be back! Get a new tie when you do. Harvey! Harvey, wait! Harvey! Harvey! Please tell me that these aren't your signatures. Yeah, I signed 'em. Yes, I si-- yes, yes, yes! Jack, these papers are legitimate. They are legally binding. For all intents and purposes, you just signed over all your assets to Julien Boulet. I'm gonna take that guy. I'm gonna pull his head out of his asshole. I'm gonna break his neck. I'm gonna lasso his nuts with piano wire. I'm gonna shove him off a building. I'm gonna watch him bounce off a bus. Then I'm gonna take pins. I'm gonna push 'em into his cheeks. I'm gonna grind him up and watch the pigeons eat his crumbs. No, I can't call the cops, Harvey. They're gonna kill her. - Then what are you gonna do? - I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I can, uh... I'll go to her place. Maybe I can stall them. I'll stall them for a day. But, uh, I gotta have help with the $2 million. I gotta get the $2 million, Harvey. I'll-- I'll do what I can, Jack. - Harvey-- - I'll do what I can. But miracles died with Frank Capra. Harvey, I need a couple hundred francs. I don't even have cab fare. I'm good for it. Not anymore you're not. Hey! Oh, shit! Jessie, you got away. You got away. - Don't move. - Oh, they're still here? Okay, okay, okay. Look, I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt her. The cash, Jack. - Huh? - The money. The ransom money. - I didn't get it yet. - You didn't bring the money? No, but listen-- - What's going on here? - Phone call for Mr. Jack Sloan. Reality on the line. There are no kidnappers. God damn, that hurts! Oh, I'm sorry. We'll have Amnesty International throw a concert for you. Wait a minute! Are you telling me this whole thing is a scam? That's right, Jack. You wanted to test me? Well, now the test is on you. - Are you crazy? - No, I'm not. Now where's the money? - Do you know what I went through for you today? - Oh, what you went through? I busted my ass all over this cobblestone burg to scrape together $2 million for you. Oh, come on. Scrape together? What does that mean? You had to borrow it from your chauffeur? I don't have a chauffeur. Stop it! Cut the Quick Burger crap! I busted my hump so that your next magazine cover wouldn't be facedown in that-- in that quaint little river over there. Oh, how sweet! Yeah, sweet enough for me to show up here so that I'll pay the ultimate price for your sweet ass! Well, then where's the money? Oh, don't! No, I don't have it on me! I don't have it! I don't have it! Listen to me! Stop it! Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me. You were right. My financial ruin was a lie, but now it's the truth, see? It all backfired on me. My best friend was supposed to hide my money for me, but he stole it instead. And so now I'm dead broke. I'm flat out. I got nothing. Nada, no, niente, c'est tout, fini. I didn't want your money, Jack. I wanted you. Now I don't even want that. Man: Police! Hold it right there! Wait, wait, wait a minute! Wait! I'm the boyfriend. - I'm the boyfriend. - Are you all right, miss? Tell him I'm the boyfriend. - You know him? - No. I'm the boyfriend! I am the boyfriend. I am the boyfriend! I'm the boyfriend! I'm the boyfriend! I'm bailing you out, Jack. Really? Why? I called Harvey Schultz and he told me you were broke. He did? I told you the same thing. You didn't believe me. Well, why should I? Because I was telling you the truth. Well, look, you're gonna get your money back, Jack. - You're damn right. - And I'm gonna help you do it. I'm sure there's a lot you can do. I think there is a lot I can do. Hey, don't do me any favors. Listen, I know I played a part in this, too. Look. Jessie, you don't owe me anything. You're a sweet girl. We had a nice time. Had a lot of laughs. Didn't last long. Broads like you never do. Look, Jack, whatever you may think of me, I'm not it. Oh, yeah? Well, neither am I. Okay. You wanna play it that way? We can play it that way. I'll help you get your money back, but that's it. And after that, the slate's clean. And I don't ever wanna see you or your money again. And you'll never have to worry about trusting me again either. Get it? Oh, to be young and single, eh, Boulet? Julien: I am young and single. - What? - I am single. You remember that vintage rationalization, "They don't make them the way they used to"? Well, my friend, I was robbed of my bachelorhood because they never made them like that. Bimbos, Varnet. They're a dime a dozen. That's no bimbo. That-- That is Grace Turner. Julien: So what? New kid on the block. MBA Harvard. Her father was a multi millionaire living in Switzerland. He left her a fortune when he died. Uh-huh. Silver spoon. No. The bottom fell out of the old man's assets before she could own them. Doesn't have a dime now, but watch your shorts, Julien. This girl is ruthless. Julien: Mm-hmm. Word is she's the hottest prodigy since Jack Sloan. Oh. Well, it's been a pleasure, Julien. Good luck, Julien. I am a millionaire. I am a millionaire. I, too, can have. I am a million-- You're Julien Boulet, aren't you? I am Julien Boulet. Grace Turner. It's a pleasure to meet you finally. I am very glad. You've done such wonderful things with your company. What? Are you feeling all right? Yes... yes. 'Cause you look a little flushed. I know. - You know? - No, no. - No? - No. Maybe some fresh air would be good for you. Maybe. Why don't you escort me to my car? - Would that be okay? - Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, excuse me. Come. Jessie: Your instincts about the pizza restaurants were absolutely correct, Julien. But your thinking is too insular. I mean, ever since the Russian coup failed, the demand for our goods and services has-- has exploded. And I think we'll be seeing profit in three years, maximum. How did a woman built like you get a hold of that cutthroat mind? How did a man like you amass such corporate power? Uh, genetics. Hard work, Julien. And passion. There's no substitute for passion, is there? So can we talk tomorrow? - Why don't we meet tomorrow? - Okay. 4 o'clock? - Mm-hmm. - Sure. - Your office? - Uh-huh. See you then. Good night, Julien. Little heavy on the smooch, wouldn't you say? What did you expect? I expected you to hook him, not check out his adenoids. Well, he strikes me as a remarkably shrewd man. I didn't think a simple handshake would do the trick. Remarkably shrewd? Julien? He's a remarkable dimwit. Right. A dimwit who's taken you for every penny you were worth. Privatization would eliminate the dead load. In our case, it merely helps consolidate it. But this way, we steer clear of the junk bond guys and larger corporate backers. Which is good, 'cause that's just more mouths to feed anyway. Also helps in avoiding Cartwright legislation. - Antitrust legislation, right? - Correct. Which prohibits collusive acts between separate competing companies. Say, for instance, if Julien's company could've told me he wanted to collaborate on a-- There's just-- there's no way I'm gonna remember all of this. Okay. Look. Think of it this way-- a good business mind is structured kind of like a lattice. It moves across, up and down, diagonally all at the same time. Julien's mind, on the other hand, is like, um, a blunt spear. It only goes in one direction at once. Number-wise he's tough, but you push him off his track, he panics. So the thing to remember is just keep him running. You know, and if things get sticky, just, um... - You know. - What? You know, just get, uh-- get... Get what? Get... You know, close. - Get close, Jack? - Yeah. How close? You know, close enough. Oh, okay. Close enough. Yeah. Close enough, Jack? Well, I guess I better stay on my toes. A blunt spear can get pretty dangerous. Sarah: Grace Turner is here to see you, Mr. Boulet. Send her to me. 4:00 on the nose. You're true to your word. Well, I like to make a good impression. - How are you? - Busy. I hope you don't mind. I took the liberty of doing a little research into your company's viability. - Oh, you did? - Yes, I did. And can I say I'm very impressed? - Oh, you are? - Yes. You've been doing your homework, Mr. Boulet. The Boulet Alliance is a potential corporate dynamo. It's remarkably well-diversified while maintaining a substantial liquid asset base. Do you mind if I say wow? Wow. Uh, yes. Uh... It was, uh, difficult, but I am proud to say I'm winning. Yes, you are. I only have one criticism, if I may? You're not nearly as effective as you could be. Diversity means flexibility. Flexibility means balance, but only to a point. When one of your arms starts to wither, you cut it off before the weakness spreads, am I right? Mm-hmm. There are only three things important in business-- Strategy. Strategy. And... strategy. Yes, Grace. You're right. I'll be frank with you, Julien. Do you know what I want? What? I wanna make money to you. Wow. How's my old friend? He's very happy these days. He's got a lot going for him. Well, he's getting in a little late, too, isn't he? - You keeping track? - Not at all. This is my 180th "Vogue" magazine since you left. Good, 'cause for a moment there I thought you were getting jealous. Jealous? Me? I have no reason to be jealous. I love reading ladies' fashion. Ladies' fashion is good for the mind. Forces one to confront great spiritual truths, to learn things. Tonight, for instance, while you were trading snake charms with that vile, scum-sucking entrepreneur, I was making myself a better person with the fall fashions. We went to see Mozart's "Don Giovanni." Mozart? That egg wouldn't know Mozart from Muzak. I believe your sleeping quarters are over there. And then he dropped me off. And this time he kissed me good night. - I said he kissed me good night. - I'm not surprised. I was. I think he's a very fast learner. Well, you should know. - Pardon me? - I said you should know. What does that mean? It means that you're a model. Seduction is your gig. And even if it wasn't part of the plan, Julien's celibacy might be a little bit of a challenge to you. Don't you think, Jessie? Or it Grace the "I'm not for sale" girl? That's a really low blow, Jack. Well, I wouldn't know. I wasn't there. What are you saying? What are you saying? Sarah: Phone call, Mr. Boulet. It's Toshi. He says it's an emergency. All right, put him through. And, um, call the restaurant to tell them to push my reservation back, uh, 10 minutes. - Mr. Boulet? - What's the problem, Toshi? The computer stock, sir. It's been dropping steadily and there is no indication of any reversal. How much? 15 points. 15 points? - What the hell is going on? - I'm not sure. What do you think? LBO? No, sir. Microchip shares are falling across the board. There is a rumor that someone in Paris is snapping up everything. - But no confirmation. - God damn it. Do we sell or stay, sir? Stay. No, sell! Um, I think. God damn, Toshi. Just do your job and call me back with a new report as soon as you can. - Yes, sir. - Mm. Mm, money. - Yes? - Ah, konnichiwa. Brokerage house, ah, Tokyo calling, um, Ms., uh, Grace, uh, Turner, s'il vous plait. Thank you. Thank you. Are you gonna tell me what's bothering you or not? It's nothing. Was it something I said? No. I am sorry to disturb you, but there is a call for Ms. Turner from Tokyo. Thank you. I can take this outside if it's a bother. No, no, no, no, please. Excuse me. Yes? I'm in a meeting, so make this quick. But that's only 85,000 units so far. Gentlemen, we're going for the whole market if we're gonna make this thing work. S-- yeah, I know! So keep buying. Buy! Buy. Bye. Who's calling from Tokyo? Toshi Brokerage Firm. I suddenly feel this is going to be a much nicer lunch. I want in. - Excuse me? - Your phone call from Tokyo. It's a bluff. You planted that bluff to clear the way for a new microprocessor. Well, I guess you found me out. You're better than I thought. I strike when the iron is hot. But there's some things you just don't share. All right, cut the shit, huh? Uh, yes, I mean, um, let's be frank, Grace. You'll never pull it off on your own. - You don't have the capital. - And how do you know that? I've got another friend in the city. The word is out on you. If you were that good a player, I would know. You are smart, but you need cash. You need help on this one. You know it. We're not just talking short-term investment here, Julien. If you're serious about this, I advise you to fasten your seat belt, because we're signing this thing tomorrow. And it is going to take every cent you've got. Taxi please. I'll pick you up at 9:00. Harvey will meet us at 9:30. And we'll go o-over everything tonight. Bye. All right, he's there. He's waiting. He's ready. He's ready to get his fangs into you, believe me. Believe me, he's ready. - My Prince Charming. - Oh, shut up. Just make sure you show him everything. - Everything, Jack? - Everything about the deal, Jessie. - Yes, Jack. - And have Harvey bring you home. - Yes, Jack. - And don't do anything I wouldn't do. Is there anything you wouldn't do, Jack? No. But I would do this. Bonsoir, Julien. You look wonderful. Thank you. No, no, no. Not that way. This way. I got us a private suite. Here we are. Psst! Jessie: Where's Harvey? He-- he can't make it. Too much to do before our big merger meeting tomorrow. Julien: Come in. May I? Whiskey? Champagne? Whiskey. My favorite blend. - Are you sure that Harvey Schultz isn't coming? - Yes, I'm sure. I know you want me, Grace. I can feel it. I do want you, Julien. I want you to look at some papers that I brought. I brought them, and I thought we could-- I am an animal. I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing. You make me feel this way. You bring out my inner beast. Oh, get on the floor. Mm. Here, oh. Trust me, excuse me. What the hell is this? It's a picture of Jack Sloan. You are cheek to cheek with Jack Sloan? Yeah. Don't you know Jack Sloan used to... How do you know him? Um, I met him two years ago in Zurich. My-- my dad introduced us. How sweet. Julien, why are you acting like this? We had a fling. He asked me to come to Paris with him. I-- I told him no. But what's his picture doing in your purse? Well, believe it or not, I'm not an old-fashioned girl, Julien. I have had boyfriends before you. Did you sleep with him? Yes, I did. Why? Because he was good. And I like good. You made the right choice, Grace. What do you mean? You were right to leave Sloan. He's not that good. I took him for everything he was worth. You took him? Mm-hmm. Everything. Lock, stock, barrel. I fixed some papers. He was so blind in love. He thought he was signing one thing when he was actually dumping his whole empire into my lap. You should have seen it. Poor bastard. He thought if he lost everything he hold, he would see if love was pure. It is pure, all right. Pure hell! This is the only thing that's pure. What is it on the back of that? "In God we trust." God. Not the true love. Good night, Julien. I'll see you in the morning. Bye. Julien? Julien. Mm-hmm. Oh, out of ink. No, sorry. I can't sign a contract with a pen that's not mine. Superstition. - Where are you going? - To the newsstand. There is one downstairs. But, Julien, we haven't got all day. Oh, yes, we do. We have all day, all night. Many days and nights and you could peddle a good damn rowboat to Tokyo and back here before I put my name on that piece of crap. I don't follow you, Julien. You are absolutely right about that, Harvey. You don't. I thought you two had worked these details out. Oh, details. You want details, Grace. Okay, I'll give you details. Well, when I woke up after last night, I went back to the offices, my home field. And Jack never cleaned out his desk. Personal items were left behind. Oh, I guess you changed your name, too. "Love you always, Jessie." "I'll never forget you, Jessie." "Jack forever, Jessie." For you, Jessie. Jessie. Well, you're all fired. See you at the sushi bar. You're gonna be the only raw fish in the joint, Julien. He hasn't signed the papers, Jack. He hasn't signed the papers, Jack. You're the best. You know everybody here, Julien, I believe, except my fianc√©e, Jessie Tailor. - Fianc√©e? - I'm game. Sorry it didn't work, Jack. You're such a major asshole, Julien. Sorry, Jack. We were so close. That's all right, sweetie. It's over, anyway. I'm sorry I didn't get home till this morning. Took all night convincing room service to give me back my tape recorder. What? It was under the bottle of Piper-Heidsieck. You put a tape recorder in the hotel suite? Yeah. That's right, Julien. Thanks for staying up with the rest of the class. - Jessie: ...but I thought we could-- - Julien: I am an animal. I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing. You make me feel this way. You bring out my inner beast. Ah, wrong cue. Little nasty. You've got a lot of nerve, Sloan. It's endearing, isn't it? Julien: Lock, stock, barrel. I fixed some papers. He was so blind in love. He thought he was signing one thing when he was actually dumping his whole empire into my lap. So easy, Julien. You won't believe it. I think the legal jargon is about 15 to 20. You're up to your ass in alligators, Julien, and I just drained the swamp. But... Shit. Sorry to make you sweat, Sloan, but you're ruined again. Nah, I don't think so, Julien. I just love chasing your ass all over this building. That cassette you're drowning there is only a copy. No! Jack. Last trip to the executive bathroom, Julien. You better enjoy it. Now what are you gonna do? Slap the shit out of me? Remember, Julien-- money will never make you tall. But then again, we all seek our own level, don't we? Thanks for the lesson, friend. I won't forget it. You already did. How dare you put this tape recorder in that room without telling me! - You'd have blown the spontaneity. - Take this for spontaneity. Wait! Jessie, hang on. Come on. Look, I had to do it that way because if you had known you were being tape-recorded, you might've gotten nervous and screwed things up. - Come on, admit it. - You didn't let me in on your little scheme, but you let me put my ass on the line with that creep. I was locked in the bedroom - with that-- - That worked! It was perfect. - You were great. We got-- - I did not sign up as your partner - to have you lie to me! - I didn't lie to you. - I didn't tell you everything, but there's a reason. - Oh, come on, Jack. Isn't there just a little part of you that thought I might actually sleep with the jerk? - Come on, you're kidding! - Ugh, God! You gotta be-- you gotta be kidding! Wait a minute! - What is all this drama? - You figure it out, Jack! Jessie! Excusez-moi, excusez-moi. Jessie: Excuse me! Hey! Hey, lady, I'm taking this cab. - Man: Typically French. - Jessie! Goodbye, Jack. Congratulations. I hope you and your millions are very happy together. Stop! Leave me alone. What is this? Get out of my cab. - It's all right. I know her, I know her. - No, he doesn't! Yes, I do. Look, look... Just give me a chance. Give us both a chance. Let me straighten this out. Make it quick, Jack. I got a dinner date. I was wrong. I was wrong about hiding the money. I was wrong about hiding the tape recorder, about doubting you. I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong. I'm sorry, and I apologize. Yeah, you feel better now? Yes. Don't you? I'm tired of getting hurt, Jack. I was hurt, too, Jessie. But there's no guarantee here. So what are you gonna do? Just walk away and walk away? I mean, you gotta be in it to win it, Jessie. You can't just sit on the bench and let everybody else play. Listen, I'm crazy about you. But people in this town are so blas√© about love. It's like they think they're gonna live forever. It's like they think they can just walk around on the next street corner and find it again. But, you know, they don't. They walk off and they blow it. So they settle for something less and then they just become old and miserable. But we got a chance here. We got a chance. You're just gonna forget about somebody you wanted to be part of your life? Just fall in love and let it slip your mind? I got scared. I got scared. I was afraid. I did, too. Everybody gets scared when we start listening to some other voice. And then we forget-- We forget to do what-- what we do best. Just trust ourselves. Just trust how we feel. I am so in love with you. - Look where we are! - I still wanna know about that tape recorder. Can we forget about the tape recorder? Look, I love you, Jessie. Don't you get it? The tape recorder was just a business contingency. A contingency? Like I-- like I'm one of your deals or something? - Stop hitting me. I didn't mean that. - Then what did you mean? Is this the way it's gonna be from now on? Yes, you lucky guy. Woman: Thank you, Jack.
