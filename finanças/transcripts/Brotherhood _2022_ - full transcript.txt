God save us! - Jesus! - God will not save you. Go! Move! Stand up. Let's go. Move out! Kalashnikov! Kalashnikov! Don't forget your friends! - Please don't forget us. - Don't forget your friends. What are you doing? You better be careful. Kala. - Kala. - My guy. - Don't forget me. If you need me… - That's not a problem. We will be in contact. If there's any job, don't forget me also. I'm there for you. - Aunty! - Thank you God. Aunty! Thank you God. - Aunty, you have gotten bigger! - You too! You have gotten bigger! My darling. - Aunty. - I am so happy to see you. God bless you. - Is this your car? - My car? No, it's a market truck. It's a market truck. Thank you God! - Some tomatoes have fallen into the trunk. - Thank you God! Don't worry. We will rearrange it, my darling. Thank you God! Thank you God! Ah! That you were able to leave that place safe and sound, I give thanks to God. My dear, so many things have changed. That Sikira that used to help me, little Sikira from back then, - Small Sikira, the little girl? - Small? Sikira is no longer is no longer small. If you see Sikira, her breasts are huge! If you see her! You see Sikira, you see breasts. Her breasts are so big. And to God be the Glory, your brother just got promoted. Today is his first day at work. - Really? - Yes. Hello, sir? Okay. Excuse me, sir. Officer Daniel will see you now. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Adewale Adetula. Yes, sir! - Welcome to the squad. - Thank you, sir! We're ready, sir. Okay. Don't thank me. Strap up, we're heading out now. - Yes, sir. - Alright! Move it! Let's go! Please, what is this they have put on our team? They have put a weak link on this team. - Can he even survive the day? - Come on. Simon, be nice. Wow. Hi. My name is Efe. Sorry, don't pay attention to Simon. - Alright, let's go. - Thank you. Wale. Nice to meet you. Move your bodies! It's okay. - Who is this? - What is this? - Impossible! - My guy! Kala! - My guy! - What's up? What you did is unfair! You're around and you didn't inform the boys. I just got back. - Put me down. Don't injure me. - My guy, my guy! Hey, whose motorcycle is that? Are you teasing me? It belongs to me. Your boy has got this. Let's ride this, my guy. Akin! Akin, where are you going? Look, I don't want trouble. The police officers are there. Akin! Who is laughing? Am I joking with you? Get back to work now. Break! Let's go. Clear! Look, I have dropped the gun. Okay? So give me your hand. Don't be afraid. Don't be worried. God save me from all this. Calm down. - Come on, give me your hand. - I am coming. Yeah. Calm down. Get them out. Get them out of here! Go! We need to go. - Well done. - Thank you, sir. Beginner's luck. Well done, newbie. Well done. Well done. Let's go! Move! Akin! Akin, my boyfriend who forgot about me! Go away! I was gone for a little while and you already have two kids. That's not it. You left me when you went to jail. You have to understand that I am only human. You are still beautiful. Thank you. Akin! See your muscles! Wow. Aunty Morenike. I haven't seen you in a while. I thought you moved. - We haven't left. - You haven't left? You are taking The Ojuju Boy's threats for a joke? Please, go home. We have heard you. You haven't heard what they having been doing? - I said leave. - Not a problem. Akin! - Your stomach has became smaller. - Thank you. We'll see later, right? - That's fine. I'll see you around. - Alright. Leave me alone. - Aunty? - Yes? Who do they call "The Ojuju Boys"? May God save us from these Ojuju Boys. We have been hearing about them. We didn't know they would get to us so soon. Not until we got a letter from them. Look, they sent me a letter. May God protect us from armed robbers. These boys are insane. There's something I want to talk to you about. But I'm not sure you will listen to me. What I want to say is, considering the situation of things at the moment, maybe we should move to your twin brother's place for some time, until things settle. Aunty, don't bother. You know I won't go. Why are you always acting this way? Cool down. Look... He is the one at the door. Help me get the door. Help me get the door. Open the door for him. - Policeman. - Criminal. God help me. What's wrong with the both of you? Aren't you born of the same mother? Why are you both acting like this? You have become more like enemies. Like a cat and mouse. Like oil and water. What is the matter? What is wrong? - Wale. - Ma. I told your brother to move to your house until things settle. But he refused. Can you please talk to him? He is not a child. If he says he is not leaving, then let him be and let us go. Is that what you have to say? But I raised you both with love. I raised you with love. Okay. All I know is, you both are supposed to be your brother's keeper. - Who's keeper? - I don't like how you are behaving. Does he keep anything but secrets? Someone who keeps the fact he has a twin brother a secret. My dear, there's garri under the bed. You know you are dependable. To collect is all he knows. What's up with you? Policeman, when you collect bribes on the express, does anyone bother you? Drop that, motherfucker. Do you want to die? Search everywhere. You won't find anything. - Shut up. - Are you mad? What are you saying? You don't know who we are? We are the ones who control this place. Goldie, give me a chance. Let me send him to the other side. - Calm down. - What?! Am I seeing correctly? Kalashnikov? What?! Cobra? My guy! How are you? Is that you? Motherfucker. Wait. You guys are The Ojuju Boys? - Yes, we are. - Impressive. Guys, let's go somewhere else. This is my friend. - Your prayers got answered tonight. - What's up? Kala. - Oh, boy... - You said this is your friend? Your god has saved you. Calm down. - Your god has saved you. - Calm down. I would have gotten rid of you. Where have you been? I have been in Kirikiri prison. - Kiri? - Yes, I just got out today. Cobra! Move it. I am coming. You know what? Let me have your number. We will be in touch. - Izra The Cobra! - Shh. Shout, so it looks like we did an actual stick up. Yes. - Someone save me! - Cry. Someone save me! Izra? There have been a series of high profile car-jackings in areas around Lagos state. We suspect that these cars are being dismantled and sold on the black market. Even the commissioner's Bentley disappeared. No leads. No trace. - Yes, Officer Wale. - Ma'am. Ma'am, I don't know if the team is aware of the operations of a certain group called "The Ojuju Boys." Quiet. We are aware. Ma, how come we are not doing anything about it? That is the job for the local police. We are an elite squad. We do not handle matters concerning area boys. Officer Monsurat, I would like to have an update on the latest car-jackings. As soon as you are done with this. Yes, sir. Let's move. Ekeng, I'll see you on Saturday, right? Of course, I wouldn't miss such a party. Hey. Hey. Don't take it personal, Officer Monsurat is strange like that. Nah, it's fine. But, for what's it's worth, I believe you. It's actually crazy because my aunt had to leave her place and stay in my place for a couple of days because they were attacking the area. And you know they sent a warning ahead. Do you know the guts it takes to do that? I know the D.P.O of that area, yeah. So I could link you guys together. And once he knows you are from us, he will be more than excited to help you. - That will be super helpful. Thank you. - I got you. Thank you. What's going on on Saturday though? Oh, it's Officer Daniel's birthday. You are coming, yeah? Cause everybody is invited. Oh yeah. Of course. Of course. For the boss, I have to be there. Cool. See you then. - See you on Saturday. - Alright. Bye. - Kalashnikov! - Cobra, my guy! My guy! - Is this you? - You are looking good. - You are living the good life. - Look who is talking? Come. Come meet my guys. - I'm seeing girls. - Come. My guy! Kehinde, why are you showing off? Lay low. Leave me alone. Mind your business. Take this idiot home. He is showing off too much. Take it easy. That idiot they're taking away is Kehinde. He is very stupid but he is loyal. Meanwhile, that's Poison. He is a completely insane. This is Emma. Townsman. Osho. Isn't this your friend that was carrying a bat? It is him. Yes, it is him. This man is Kalashnikov. He is too bad! My guy! What kind of name is that? - What is Kakaaki? - You haven't heard of Kalashnikov? You have been hearing of AK47, that's the person who invented it. Akin right here is extremely intelligent. He is so smart! And he has a twin. The three of us ran things in Oshodi that year. Akin would come up with plans for what we would eat, could steal… No mom or dad. Orphans! You know how it goes. My respects to you guys. - What would you like to have? - Don't bother, I'm good. Please, lets quickly discuss something outside. Okay. Let's go. - Chairmen. Much respect! - Sir. - Respect. - Respect. This guy's name doesn't make sense. What is "Kakaaki"? - Who's that? - What's that? That guy was just throwing money everywhere. You wouldn't be able to handle the way we party. Is he that rich? I swear. It's not that way. So… I have observed how you guys operate. - Yeah? - I can help you guys upgrade. What do you mean? So I have a friend from jail. Actually, he isn't a friend. He is my brother. He used to drive a bullion van before he got in trouble and landed in jail. How much do you think a bullion van carries? - Maybe up to five million? - Are you joking? Guy, a bullion van carries between 20 to a 100 million. So if your guys and my people put our resources together we could rob one bullion van. It would be like we robbed a bank. Everyone would cash out. I'm liking this idea. I am really liking this idea. But this our crew… we don't do things carelessly. We have a structure. We have a CEO. Right. Shadow. But he is getting old. This type of things interested him before he retired. You know what's going to happen? I'll introduce you to Shadow, and you'll tell him what you just told me. I would really appreciate it. You are my friend. Ever since you came to my place, that's all I have been thinking about. - Yeah, man. - I mean this could work out. - I understand what you mean. - It'll definitely work out. Izzie? I'll see you later. This is our first lady, Goldie. You were looking at my ass when I was dancing, right? How did you see me? Weren't you pretending not to see me? You… Can you dance? Just say you want to dance with me. Be direct about it. - Akin, calm down. Calm down. - Oh wow. You guys have a CEO? - You have a First Lady? - Yes. Calm down. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you! How old are you now? Yo, my people! When I first met my boss, I was a young officer and I did not want to be in the police force. But I met Officer Daniel and he told me "Since you don't want to be here, I will frustrate you until you leave." And he did by playing pranks on me. But today I am proud to say… -I'm so sorry -Oh, no. - I'm so sorry. - It's fine. Thank you. One of the few good men who do this job for the love of the country. Hey! You are not her type. She doesn't do broke policemen. Simon. Please, don't mind him, he was interested in her but she rejected him. - Really? - I'm sorry. - You know we're cool. - Wow. I need a drink. Do you see a waiter here? Go to the kitchen and grab a drink. There are plenty there. And with all of this, sir, we are saying happy birthday. Nobody can do this job like you. Yes. Honorable man! Hear, hear! Hip, hip, hip! - Hurray! - Hip, hip, hip! Hurray! Hi. Do you mind if I help you out? Officer? You want to wash plate? Of course. I'm actually really good at this. See, I can see there is still some oil on it. She has always been… Oil where? Okay. - Come and do it. - Alright. Best in washing plates. So I wash. You rinse. Team work… makes the dream work. Maybe I should tell them to bring more plates since you are in the mood. No, I'm trying to help. I'm not trying to get a new job. - I'm just joking. - My name is Wale. Kamsi. Nice to meet you. There you go. Who here, even if… I didn't know she had invited all these rascals Boss, you will miss us! - Ta! - You will miss us! I'll be farming in my village. So no one is going to say anything. With everything these guys have done in all these areas? You talk, you die. Or they kill your whole family. It's not worth it for them. Mr. D.P.O, listen. I am with you. Whatever it takes to get these guys. If you hear anything, even the littlest piece of information, - I beg you. Thank you so much. - It's alright. - I appreciate this. Thank you. - Not at all. Well done. Thank you. I know you all are stupid. Yeah. I know you are fools, but… If someone had told me you'd act as foolishly as you just did, I wouldn't have believed it. Because I don't see why you'll carry out an operation that I didn't approve. Number one. Boss. We were not trying to disrespect you. We just thought we could easily get it done. We saw an opportunity and we decided to take it. Use wisdom and initiative to get it done. Initiative? That's what you taught us. If they ask, "Who has initiative?" You will stand up? The next time something like this happens, I will do something I will regret. I am talking and you are wiping your face. - What? - Please don't be angry. Get out of this place. - Boss, we were... - Shut up! "Boss" my ass. Boss! Boss, well done! Izra. Boss. This is my friend I told you about. Chairman. So you're the guy with the big plans, right? So you want to upgrade us? Who am I to upgrade you? I just saw an opportunity that would help all of us. Sit down. - What is your name? - Akin. What do you mean, Akin? Boss, this is Kalashnikov. Kala. Kala? Let me hear your plans. So I was talking to this guy about how much he thinks is carried in a bullion van. He said five to ten million. Boss, up to 20 to 100 million is carried in a bullion van heading to the bank. Really? You know that's why bullion vans are heavily guarded, right? Bro! I like you. You are visualizing my plan. I am not visualizing your plan. So bro, we will handle this mission like it is a military mission. Heavy presence. Police officers do not want to die. Izra, do you trust this guy? Boss, this is Kala. We go way back. Let me hear your plan. So I have this friend. He has driven bullion vans before, so he knows how they operate. Kala! His name is Adura. Then I have another guy. Ikeja! Ikeja! There is no where in Lagos that He doesn't know. My brother! Then we will need tools. I have tools. That area is covered. Chairman, I don't mean you any disrespect but my plug is an ex-military expert. The kind of weapons we will need are on a completely different level. If the police see them, they will run. - Where are the tools? - You are standing on top of them. Warrior. This is good So if we have all of them everything is guaranteed? Boss, that's confirmed. And the sweet part is, I have already mapped out our first target. Today it's elephant green, tomorrow's it is crocodile red. She'll buy it for 30,000, and sew it for 50,000. I am tired of it. - I am angry. - Why are you talking like this? - I don't know what you want me to do. - You know women and their trouble. But you are still complaining. You will be okay. I'm exhausted. Guy, move fast. Move fast. Boss, it's just a garbage truck. If you see what my wife puts me through because of this asoebi matter… Huh? I'm in trouble! I'm in trouble! - Everyone reverse! Reverse now! - I'm in trouble! Reverse! Reverse! Reverse! Officers down! We are under attack! Send back up! Send back up! We are under attack! Don't move! Stay low! If you move I fuck you up! Don't try it! Make a move, I fuck you up! Bring that fucking shit here. Bring that gun! That way. - Out! - Don't try it! Move! Get the fuck down! Come down. Officers! Down! Down. Hands behind your back. Hands behind your back! Sixty seconds! Drop it! Don't do anything, else I will kill you. Have you lost your mind? We are all out here hustling, bank managers are relaxing in their homes. You left your wife and your children to guard money that's insured. If there are any bonuses, do you get a part of it? - Answer me! - No, sir! If everyone behaves, no one will die today. Let's go! Let's move! - Move! - Move! Fuck you! He will die! Move! - Hurry, come on! - Do you hear me? Fuck you! Put it away. - Let's go! - Where is Kehinde and Poison? - They didn't show up. - One minute, guys! Fast! Guys! - C'mon, let's go! - Move! Guys I need speed! Move! Move! Move! Put everything. What is wrong with you? Do you want to fuck up my plan? - Step back! - Are you crazy? - You know me! You know me! - What is going on? He shot someone! And you want to discuss it here? Is this the appropriate place to discuss that? Get in the car and let's get out of here. Are you crazy? - Everyone get in, let's move! - Move! Kala, behave! Behave! Guys, fast! Fast! We don't have time! Everybody move! Kamsi. Kamsi? Did you even sleep at all? Yes, I did. I have to go though. Where are you going? I'm going home. What's going on? You have been acting kind of weird lately. It's nothing, Wale. I'm fine. Ah, man. Wale. There's a little guy in there? What if it's a girl? Kamsi, why didn't you say anything? I was scared. Hold on. What are you looking for? Give me your hand. - Wale, what are you doing? - Give me your hand. Wale, what… Kamsi, I love you so, so much. Marry me. This is crazy. It's only been three months. I have never been more sure of anything in my entire life. Kamsi, all my life, I've felt alone. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I am certain of that. - Yes. - Yes? Is that a yes? Yes. Million times, a yes. Damn. It's work. One second. Hello? Thank you so much for your patience. However, I would crave your indulgence. As you can see, we are still investigating. So we must make sure we do not pass the wrong message on to the public. We are thankful that no lives were lost. One or two officers were injured. But that's it. And, unfortunately, there is nothing more that I can give you now. So I would love for you to be patient, and make sure that the information you are sending to the general public isn't one that would cause panic. Boy. I could not see their faces. They were all masked. Like masquerades. Like masquerades? Yes sir. Everything happened so fast. Sir! I ran the plate numbers and they came back fake. I thought so. The insurance company is willing to back up the investigation. Okay? - So we need to give them a report. - I am on it, sir. - Morning, sir. - How are you, Wale? What's up? What's the update? This is some big boy thing. Not those small boys you are always chasing around. And how do you know they are not connected to this? RPG? Fake license plates? This is some big boys' stuff. Not all those amateurish level. Joker. Hello? D.P.O. I was just about to call you actually. Officer. Okay. I have something for you. Really? He was arrested in a bar last night. He got into a fight with some boys over some girls. Somebody identified him as one of the Ojuju Boys. Officer, what is up? We haven't eaten since last night. Why? This is why I prefer prison. - By now, I would have eaten breakfast. - My friend, will you shut up! Boss, it is not like that. Mr. Kehinde? Right? Thanks for your patience. Well done. It's terribly unfortunate that we have to meet in these circumstances, sir. I am really sorry. The name is Officer Wale Adetula. Yeah, I am here to help you. I am here to help you. You know what? This is what will happen now. I'll help you talk to them, so they will let you go. You have to regain your freedom. Frankly, nobody should be treated in this manner. I just need a little piece of information from you, sir. Who are The Ojuju Boys? Do I look like a snitch to you? Do I look like a snitch to you? Put me in a cell right away, because I have nothing to tell you. I like being in the prison. Kirikiri prison or the one in Ikoyi? Any of the prisons are fine. But that Ikoyi prison though… The mosquitoes in that Ikoyi prison are not normal. They are almost like you police officers. Wait, Officer! I want to tell you more. Allow me give you more gist as you leave. Wait. That Ikoyi prison, the water is so bad. It is so smelly! Everything will be fine. This is how Shadow and Izra do things. See, this isn't like your regular operations. With the large amounts of money we are moving, the police will find us. I hope you know. Listen, I trust Shadow with my life. I remember the day like it was yesterday. Some boys wanted to rape me. I was there trying to fight. Shadow appeared and he killed all of them. He rescued me. He brought me into Ojuju. Every Ojuju boy, Shadow rescued them. Every single person. I don't trust anybody. No one is an angel. You trust me, right? You trust me, right? You are watching Arise News with me, Adefemi Akinsanya. Not more than a week has passed since armed men attacked a bullion van convoy in central Lagos. Making away with 50 million naira. Since then, police have confirmed no arrests have been made. No suspects apprehended. And many residents have been asking how it's possible. These men and the money they have stolen appear to have disappeared. At this rate we are forced to believe that the police - are in on these criminal activities. - Come on! -You can't- -Yes You can't associate the police with common criminals. That is what it means! -Those are mere fairy grapevine, -If we can… in trying to tarnish - the image of the police! - If we cannot not be... Someone is here to see you. Oh! Wale! Yes, sir. - How are you? - Fine, thank you sir. - Welcome. - Thank you very much. Kamsi, did I tell you how Wale saved my life on the very first day he joined the SWAT Unit. Daddy, you have told me this story several times. - This is a super cop here. - My pleasure, sir. Welcome. Wale, sit. - Sit. Sit down. - Thank you very much, sir. - Wow, how are you? - I am fine, thank you, sir. Good. Uh, Kamsi, bring another Trophy for Wale. Yes. - How are you doing? - I am very okay, sir. Good. Sir, I want to discuss something very important with you. Sir, since the first time I set my eyes on Kamsi, I realized I want to spend the rest of my life with her. Sir, I decided to come here today, to officially ask for her hand in marriage. Just after three months at my birthday? Sir, when a man knows, he knows. Come, my dear girl. When a man knows, he knows. My first daughter. Daddy's daughter. Well. Sit down. - Wale. - Yes, sir? Kamsi here is all I've got. And you are a good man. So if she says yes, you have my blessing. Thank you very much, sir. - Thank you, sir. - No. - Get up. Get up. - Thank you, sir. Daddy's daughter. Things have been happening. Is it Akin that bought all these? And you accepted it? And you know he doesn't have a good paying job? No! Don't say that. Akin now has a good job. A very good job. He has changed a lot. When he leaves in the morning, he come back late at night. - He has changed? - Where does he work? Let's not worry about that. The important thing is the wedding is the reason I brought out all these clothes. So you will pick the color you want. - So I will know how to buy it in bulk. - Don't bother. There's no colour. There's no family colour. There's no asoebi. Aunty, this is the invitation I brought for you. You are the only one I am inviting to this wedding. So they don't say I don't have relatives. That's why I am inviting you. And I know you, you will want to invite the entire world. Aunty, I don't want to see any uninvited guests. The invite admits one. Thank you very much. Pity. You are so bold. "So they don't say I don't have relatives." You wouldn't have invited me. Even if you don't invite me, what about your sibling? What about your twin? You won't invite him too? Aunty, this woman and her family - are very important to me. - Oh, really? I don't want riff-raffs ruining my wedding. Who are the riff-raffs? - You know who I am talking about. - Shut up! Shut your dirty mouth! If not for Akin, you would be dead by now. Five years awaiting trail for a 14-year-old boy! With those criminals in that cell! And for what? Just because of you! Just because he went to go steal malaria drugs for you to get better. Aunty, what about the second time? And the third time? What about the fourth time? Did he go and steal malaria drugs again? This boy has been in and out of prison for the last ten years. Am I the one who sent him back? Aunty, I have tried. I have tried. You have tried. We tried to get him out. We did not try enough. We didn't do enough, at all. If you were to be in your brothers shoes, by now, you would have been worse. Actually, I wore the exact same shoes, Aunty. I wore those exact same shoes because Akin was not the only one who had it bad. I came from the exact same streets. I chose to do better. I chose to be a better man. Aunty, don't invite Akin to my wedding. I will not have him ruin everything I have worked for. - Thank you, ma. - Wale! You need to keep your family close. The bond of brotherhood is unbreakable. Wale! What's causing the quarrel between you both? You are the reason. You are indeed the reason for the quarrel. Is it out there that you got all those goods for Aunty? And the one with you too? How did you get that? What's with the questions? Are you my Dad? If you want to know, I'm a mechanic. - You're now a mechanic. - Yeah. Look, I am done with you. You can mess up your life all you want. Just don't take everyone down with you. Off with your fancy english! You had better find something to do with your life I'm also done with you. I don't care about you. Nobody does. Pretentious fool. What happened? Did you quarrel with your friend? What is this? He says he is getting married. - Aunty! - My darling is here! How are you doing? Who the hell are these guys? Guy, I have no idea. But check out this girl's shoes. Geez! Congratulations! Eh! - You're a man now. - What are you doing here? Can't I come to my twin's wedding? You didn't want to invite us. Your wife is beautiful. A great girl. I always pride myself to be a good judge of character. And that is why I gave you my daughter's hand in marriage. But tell me, what kind of man hides his twin brother? Is there something else you are hiding? Sir, it is complicated. My brother has always been on the wrong side of the law. He is always going in and out of jail. So your twin brother is an ex-convict? I don't have that in your file here. I joined the force because I wanted to make a difference. Then I realized that my brother being in and out of prison was not going to help that. Because telling the truth would have destroyed my career. So I decided to keep up the lie. I'm terribly sorry, sir. I completely understand if you report me to Internal Affairs. I am ready to face the consequence. Do you realize that you have put me in a really impossible position. In my 30 years of service to the Nigerian Police, I have kept a reputation that is unquestionable. Yes, sir. So what am I supposed to do now? Report my son-in-law? To the authorities? One week after marriage to my pregnant daughter? - Get out. - I'm sorry, sir. Wale. Don't pay attention to these people. Just don't mind them. They'll move on. - Okay? - Thank you. Mr. D.P.O. Officer, that guy has started talking. Mr. Kehinde. Has mosquito bitten you that badly? I thought you liked it here. Super cop. Since everyone has forgotten me here now that they have become rich, what would you have me do? I gotta find my way out, man. I saw you with my people. You were just living large! The money is a lot! I and who? We have watched your wedding video on the internet. You married that beautiful girl. Your babe is endowed. She is so sweet. It was my people around you spraying you money. You didn't know? You know these people. You know these people. They are the ones. The Ojuju Boys. Idiot. Hey man, make the arrangements to get me out of here. He who laughs last, laughs best. - Five hundred thousand for a hookup? - Is it your money that I used? Then you gave her head. - She is supposed to pay you. - Is it your money? She is supposed to have paid you. Get out of here! How are you? How are you doing? Godwin. My G. How are you? - Have you lost your bet? - Kala! What? You know, with our job we are supposed to keep a low profile. It is not everything we do that people should see. Is someone told me that anyone would fuck up, Kala, it shouldn't be you. What sort of rubbish is this? Boss, please don't be angry. That is my brother. My blood brother. Same mother and father. Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen, right? Nothing will happen. He said nothing will happen. If anybody fucks up my plans, before I travel out of this country, it will be bloody. Kala, did you hear me? - Please sir, don't be angry. - It will be bloody. Don't be angry, boss. - Don't be angry. - The baddest boss. New mission, guys. A different type of job. So there's this lady I was sleeping with sometime ago. She works for a bank. She has information about money that is coming in. About 100 million. So we strike the bank and then - we will formulate... - No! Boss- Kala! Keep quiet. The money still has to come. So they will divert another set of that same amount to another branch. And they won't expect that we will strike them again. Meanwhile, we'll be waiting for them. We run it. We have 200 million in the bank. - This your... - We move. This is greed. - This your plan won't end well. - Kala. Please Kala, what are you saying? What? Big Boss, look… This mission doesn't make sense. Who is your source? For this information, who is your source? She is a teller, but she knows what goes on in the bank. Boss, in a bank, there is a department that handles cash movement. Cash Management. How do you know? This is what I do. Your source is not valid. You want us to run two operations in one day? Kala, are you doubting my plan? I don't have an issue with you. But your plan doesn't make sense. When you brought your own plan, didn't we carry it out? - That is different! I... - How is it different? - I planned it! I arranged... - How is it different? - You think that... - Kala! Move back. Kala, move back. I said, move back. If you don't check yourself, I will beat you up. - Who are you? - I will beat you. - What are you saying? - Who are you? Go back. Leave him. It's enough. You, go back. You see… this 200 million… if we get it, everybody would be settled. So… We are in a democracy. We will vote. If you want us to do this, raise up your hands. They will get beaten mercilessly. Kala… Just accept it! Final. Guy, go back there. Izra. - Kala? - Big Boss. Are you in or are you out? Kala. Kala, I am going to ask you one more time. Are you in? Or, are you out? Boss, I won't do it. Fuck this shit. Fuck you! Leave! Fool! Leave! What's the matter with you? Boss. I will reach my contact to set things up. See, these people are mad. They are crazy. And this job that they want to do, they will die. Or they will end up in prison. As for me, nothing… Goldie, nothing can take me to the prison again. See, our last job It was two million we each got. And we exhausted it at your brother's wedding. If you sit plan this well, why won't it work out? See, Shadow and Izzie don't have the brains you do. And, honestly, this is 200 million. Two hundred million! Dude, come on! Aren't you in your right senses? See, Shadow takes his 20 percent. Move. You take your share. I take my share. We join it together. Relocate. Or aren't you tired of being an armed robber? I am tired of it. Aren't we leaving anymore? Aren't we leaving? Push it. Look at that. Who are you looking for? Ah! Wala-ta! Wale Adetula! Dancing groom! Nice one! How are you? Wow. Guy, what are you doing here? You guys came to my wedding, so I thought to come by and thank you guys. Ah! Nice one! Thank you! Akin isn't here? You just missed him. I just missed him? - He just left. - Really? Yeah. What happened? This is Shadow's shop right? How do you know Shadow? Akin told me that you guys work for Shadow. Calm down. Are you scared? Wale, I think you should leave. Call Akin and find a place to meet up with him. - I should leave? - Yes. - Till we meet again. - Till then. Two robberies, back to back. This isn't street parole. How? How will we do it? How many people will we use? How do we move the money? Where do we move the money to? Have you thought about it? No, tell me. I am listening. Look… you're a pretty boy. But you and I know that strategy isn't your strength. You know. So you think I am stupid? You think I am not smart. That's why you like him, right? Both of you… figure this shit out. Don't mess with my money. Orphan. Bloody orphan. Aren't we all together? Why didn't you tell us you have a plan? Your greed is too much. You have always been like that We used to steal Aunty Morenike's rice and stew. We introduced you to it, but you went over board. But Akin, you know if you want to eat a frog, you need to find one that has egg. You're a motherfucker. I know that I get angry easily. But you plan these jobs. It's you. Like how you told us to use a motorcycle and a pickup truck. So that if they catch anybody, we don't lose everything. That is all you. - Stop teasing me. - You are too smart! You know! Guy! Come on! I have a plan. But this one, we will do it the exact way we plan it. We will do it. No. We will do it how I say. So. Hey, Officer Wale, I thought you wanted to see the boss. Wale, you wanted to see me. I just wanted to greet you sir. Oh okay. I am heading for the hospital right now. Need to do my checkups. - Well, I will see you when I get back. - No problem sir. Get this car out of here. Hey! What are you doing over here? - Will you get out of this place! - Ah! My brother, don't be offended. The bus broke down. And I just changed its carburetor! - And I'm wondering, how is it that... - No! Move it! - Get it away! - You don't understand what happened. - I said get out of this place! - That's exactly what I'm trying to do. I said leave here now! I'm trying to do that. I'll start it now. The bus is refusing to start. No time to check time! - Start to move! - Please move! Don't vex me today. I'll finish you! Drive! Drive quickly! Everybody, stand down! You're not going to sleep here. If not… Hey, don't vex me! Don't vex me. Code red! Ongoing bank robbery! Alright. Copy that. Copy that. Over. Move! Go! Eagle! Explosives. Eagle! Explosives! Dude, explosives for what? There's money in the ATM. How much is in an ATM?! Let us go! Fall back! This is my mission! They will call the police! - Blow it up! - Blow what? Are you crazy? Come out of there! Move! Move! Take cover! Move! Move! Go! Go! Move! Move! Eyes on the suspect. Eyes on the suspect. I am in pursuit! Ah, let's get them. Get them! Let's go! Faster! Drive faster! Move! Let's go! Move quickly! - Move! - Move it! Let's go! Let's move it! Let's go! Man, he's losing blood. Let's move out! Light it up! Let's go! Are you cursed? Are you mad?! - Are you mad? - It won't be well with you! - Are you crazy? Are you mad? - Hey, hey! - You are crazy! - You're too greedy! Leave me alone! You are cursed, man! - Leave me! - Kala! - Kala! - Why are you holding me? - Kala! - Why are you holding me? - Why are you holding me? - Akin, it is me holding you. - What happened? - Calm down. - I said what happened? - Daju got shot! Because of this guy, I killed my brother's father-in-law! Okay. So? Don't you know people die in this line of work? People die. It is normal. Guys, on to the next score. Do you hear me? I am not taking part in another score. - Give me my share so I can leave. - What did you say? I should give you "your share?" Really? Nobody is getting a dime. Can you hear me? Nobody is getting a dime until we are done with the second score. Guys, pack up on to the next one. Let me see. Look… Kalashnikov. Even a dog doesn't bite the hand that feeds it. Look at Kala. Kala, you are pointing a gun at me? You are pointing a gun at me? Kala, shoot me. Kala, you must shoot me. If you don't, I will kill you right here. Okay. Let's all calm down. We are all brothers here. Stop that! These motherfuckers aren't my brothers. Kala. Kala, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Boys, calm down. Calm down. Calm down! Drop the weapon. Izzie! Poison. Drop the weapon. Izzie! I said drop the weapon now! You all want to go ahead, right? Right? Fuck this. And fuck you. Wale, where's my dad? Wale, where's my dad? Don't tell me it's okay. Where's my dad? What's going on? Somebody… Somebody… Oh my God. My father! Oh no. Just six months. That's all the boss had left to retire. Now these bloodthirsty motherfuckers just… Now he won't even live to see his first grandchild. These guys are done. Fuck! Where is Akin? Aunty! Where is Akin? - He isn't here. What is... - If he is hiding here, he should come out. This is a serious matter. What happened? What is it? I just saw footage from the robbery. And I can swear, Akin is one of them. Akin? How do you know it's him? They were wearing masks. But I can swear on my life. Akin was one of them. Since you've said they wore masks, don't tie Akin's name to such. Aunty, I said he is one of them! They killed my father-in-law! They just killed my father-in-law, Aunty! And Akin is one of the robbers! Reduce your voice, people around can hear us. Please calm down. Please don't say such a thing, I beg you. Don't include his name with such acts. Especially when you are not sure. Adura. You know I have experienced a lot in life. People have fucked me up. Life has fucked me up. If they had told me you'd do the same, I would have disagreed. Bro, I can't do such a thing. Bro, but you know… You know that whatever you say goes for us. We can't do anything without you. We can't handle it ourselves. We can't handle them alone, they are way more than us. Also, is this how we want to keep living? Living from hand to mouth. I'm tired. Fine, we are risking our lives. But isn't that better? If we keep doing this, there are only two ways out. We either go back to prison or we die. But if we decide to risk our lives, that's better. So our lives will change for better. Kala, let's go in. Everyone is waiting for you. Let's go. I know everyone thinks I'm acting up. Don't be mad at me. I know this operation is for one person. So let's do it. Boss. Yeah. The bullion van will get to the express via this route. We will station Posion and his guys as construction workers. They will block this side. But they know our M.O now. They know we use motorcycles and trucks. - But I have another plan. - Hmm. Before you go on about your plan… Guys. I want everyone to memorize this number This guy smuggles anything in or out of this country. Big or small. He has already collected today's loot. He has converted it to dollars. If you call him, he will guide you on where to meet up. For the next two weeks, I don't want you all contacting anybody. Don't call your father, mother, brother, sister or girlfriend. Lay low. That's for the people who will make it. Because not all of us will make it. He is leaving by 00:00 hours tomorrow. It's only those who he sees that he will take with him. What is the destination? Togo. After that, we will all disperse. And we would never need to see each other again. - What's wrong with you! - Did you leave your brain at home?! - It is like you are crazy! - Move out of the way! - So you didn't see me approaching! - Are you going to move? You are sick. - You don't listen, right? - Leave my- - You don't listen… - Buy some sausage rolls. Man, move your vehicle. - You know this area is jammed. - The drink is not cold. …Lagos State, on Third Mainland Bridge, there's very heavy traffic there. The construction workers fixing the road are causing the traffic and the LASTMA traffic wardens… Should I go check? Okay no problem. I am coming. Heads down! Hey! Everyone, they are at it again! Let's go! Third Mainland Bridge! Heads down! - Come down! - Come down! - Down! - Down! Now! Move! Man, on the floor! Get down! Move! If anyone of you has the guts to try me, I will fuck you up!

Fuck! Akin! - Wale! - Hold your fucking fire! That's my brother! Fuck! The ringleader of the infamous group, Ojuju Boys, Joshua Akintola, also known as Shadow, was apprehended and is currently still in police custody. A spokesman confirmed Akintola is currently receiving medical attention. The attorney general has promised the judicial process will be swift and severe. One of the group's senior leaders, Akin Adetula, was shot- and is believed to have fallen into the waters under Eko Bridge. Divers are yet to recover his body, as the search for fatalities continues. - I'm all messed up. - Another gang member yet to be identified is believed to have survived the showdown. Morenike, your mind is all messed up! I'm done for. I'm dead. It's not fair. A whole child. Leave me alone. I'm all done for. Who's there? - Baba, it is me. - Open! Baba, everything scattered. The police came. As they came, everyone took off. It seems I'm the only survivor. That's not my business. Me? I will carry anyone at the agreed time. Okay. That's not an issue. I believe this is the balance of the money. Yes. Bring it here. Where should I put it? Put it here. Put it here. When I dance, I feel free. I will come back. Free to live. Free to choose. Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? What do you mean, nothing? We saw him get in the water. Tell them to get back in there and find him! And if they can't do their fucking jobs, get people who are more competent to do their jobs! Officer Wale. These men are from internal affairs. And they want to have a word with you. Yes, ma'am. It won't be well with your loved ones. Let's go meet Dada! Dada. Vroom! Vroom! See Dada! Da! Now that the case is closed, I hope they finally lift your suspension. I hope so too. Sorry, let me take this. Hello? Officer. Stupid criminal. Subtitle translation by: Ayolope Koiki
