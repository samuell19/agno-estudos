Porur.... Porur.... This is the stance for those who comes new to Chennai in search of life. Hey, share auto. Madam, Are you going to porur? -yes, brother. Get in, madam. -we're five people. You've place. -okay, brother. Dude, one of you come front. There is place.... -me? Yes, come front. Get in. Adjust and sit, madam. -didn't Geetha come? -she said she'll go by bus. He'll see many girls in his office. He might've sit at the front. Where are you going? -Valasaravakkam. Twenty Rupees is the fare. You shouldn't bargain when getting down. He would've seen my stature. But, I was different in my native place. We do the work, and you enjoy the results? Why you keep shouting that you cultivated the soil? You were paid for it, isn't it? We also eat by buying the crops. Money isn't important. It is temporary. Hey, can't you help me out? I must buy a new remote. You're stretching the legs well, right? Change with it. Sivagami... How will he be good, if you scold me whenever I advise him? Dad, buy a remote when you go to town. Okay. Hey, your friend has come. Dad, I'm going to the town. I'll buy. Give two hundred rupees. Have it, dad. Hey, I'm coming, wait. Why are you irritating when you know I'm coming. Guys keep calling. -go... I had a dignity. Guys behave furiously when I'm around. We'll be ready for a brawl. If anyone talks harsh before me... Don't leave them, Saravanan. Hit them. Thrash them. If you dare, conflict and courage comes together. You can search me here too. Sign and get in, Saravanan. Who comes here other than me? You're right. But, if you don't sign, the library will be closed... ... citing lack of visitors as a reason. Is it okay? Has the second part of "Marma vidhai" came? It'll take two days. "Psychology of the Library" If you take a particular book in the rack of the library... ...and keep in another rack. Later, If you ask the librarian to search for that book... Sir, I've kept the book which I took from another rack. Find out, if you can. I'm in work. Come on, sir. It's not found. He'll search in the related rack only. His thoughts and hands won't go to other racks. What? Just a minute. Read this. You're more curious. That means? Attitude? -Not attitude. It's either eagerness or searching. But, it's worst than the attitude you said. Dad, don't get tensed. I'm just trying as everyone smokes. If I feel good, I may continue. Your life is in your hands. Some habits will not leave us, though we try our best to leave that. I was a drop out after eighth grade. Atleast , I should've studied upto tenth grade. But, for the school practical projects... ...children in my street will come to me. You could've shown this interest when you studied. Practical knowledge is education. If it's only practicals, it's good to study. Instead, something is taught unnecessarily. That should be by-hearted and written as exam. Right? -yes, brother. Dude, look here. How the car door is opened! Show me. Dude, you're doing unwanted things. It's because of you. -hey Saravanan, no need. What I did? I just showed him the video. Saravanan... Is it necessary? -hey, Saravanan Something may happen. -won't you listen? Listen us. -be quiet. He broke it. Hey... Dad, are you aware what he did along with others? -hey... He is a guy. He do whatever he wish. You don't speak anything about him. You spoilt him by saying so. He is not at all staying at home. You're not asking him anything. Why are you silent? He doesn't know what's happening in the house. But, for others.... Serve me the curry. It's okay. I'm not well nowadays. Take care. They've sent me to Chennai with their sentimental reasons. A year has passed since I came to Chennai. I've shifted many jobs. Nothing is good for me. Wherever I go, this blue shirt is given. Like the sky without clouds. Sometimes, it's the job where I speak only with the machines. Always crowded. Nothing apart from that. I never washed my plate in home. But, I was given the job of preparing the juices. I slit my finger while cutting the pomegranate when new to the job. But, I like to know the unknown things. In couple of days, my hands, knife and fruits have become familiar for me. Mani, my friend is taking care of me not letting... ... to take up any other job and to go anywhere. And Anandhi working in the opposite shop, which is locked now. -Hello, -tell me, brother. -Heard that there is an acre of land in Padappai. Welcome, sir. Saravanan, a glass of watermelon juice. -okay, the business is going on good. -I must meet the boss to discuss some things. -need an appointment. -what happened to two C... -thank you. Pay thirty rupees. -brother, take it. I'll leave. -okay, sir. -the number you're trying to reach is currently switched off or not reachable. Saravanan, look here. It's the same, how many times you call. You didn't speak just for two days. She'll come tomorrow, leave it. What's the news about actress, Nayanthara? Read and tell me. I'll break your tooth. Then, you were blabbering that the share auto driver... ... made you to sit in front. That's different. She is my love... Everyone is woman, right? Mani, there is a difference between flirting and love. You won't understand that. You say something and conclude that I won't understand. I can understand only if you say in the way, I understand. Brother, a tea. You've got a job. Go... I didn't believe till two months ago. That, she'll fall in love with me. I hesitated to talk with her. Because of her eyes! Brother, a tea. Brother, I feel someone is following me, wherever I go. Should I inform you and go? Will you say it as accidental coming behind me wherever I go? No... Just to see you. Take it. Why did you speak so? Leave it. Now she knows, I'm looking at her. It's her decision, whether to like me or not. You're managing well. Hey, why are you shouting in the shop? Do you think of you as beauteous? No. I don't think of me as beauteous. It's you thinking and looking so. Saravanan, don't look like that. What happened? "I saw my love..." "I felt your fragrance in my heart..." "I was perplexed whether I'm your's or mine?" "Come on...my soul, you're my everything..." "You...the rain drops in the loneliness..." "You spoke in my silence..." "I was lost with my conscious..." "Is this the fever of love?" "The valiant lass, You roam around my heart," "I'm stumbling and getting seduced behind you..." "You're doing something with your gestures of eyes" "The valiant lass...oh," "The heart beats by the ecstasy which this love grants." "The soul doesn't get deflated" "Doesn't get laze..." "It plays in the whole mind And steals..." "Without sleeping everyday" "Without going away..." "When I see myself in the mirror" "My eyes search you." "Shall I lie that it's enough?" "The valiant lass, You roam around my heart," "I'm stumbling and getting seduced behind you..." "You're doing something with your gestures of eyes" "The valiant lass...oh," "I saw my love..." "I felt your fragrance in my heart..." "I was perplexed whether I'm your's or mine?" "Come on...my soul, you're my everything..." "You...the rain drops in the loneliness..." "You spoke in my silence..." "I was lost with my conscious..." A musical line from "Thaanaa Serndha Koottam". A musical line from "Mersal". Hey, stay on to one channel. That remote will cry out, if it has life. You're taking my life as she didn't attend your call. When everyone is watching the other programme of a doctor, You're simply watching this one? Hey, we've to watch what we don't know. Then, you know those things! After ten, everyone will watch different programme. But, you're watching a monotonous programme. Hey... Be seated. He has started. What? Listen carefully. When we occupy the house where someone has resided earlier, If we search in the idle place of that house... ...we might get some old and different materials. Different means? Different... Like an old coin. Is that programme about this? Now, the TV stand is there right from the day we came. Yes. Just put your hand under that. You'll get something. Hey, bend well and search. Nothing is here. Your research is a failure. Nothing is there. I got back pain. Two things, Mani. When this programme was telecasted last week, I searched and found this old coin. You said, you got back pain. Then, you have to watch this sort of programme. Take it. You'd have brought the other people when coming. Have you slept? No, sister. - have I disturbed you? No, it's okay. Isn't Mani there? I'll call him. Hey, the owner has come. She is calling you. Mani, I ordered for a bureau. Will you help the people who comes along with it? Okay, sister. I checked for Ibrahim. He went for night shift, it seems. It's locked. It's okay, sister. We'll help. Murugan, be careful. It's of heavy weight. Hello... Yes. Is it Saligramam? I'll go at nine o'clock in the morning for coverage. Turn it carefully. -It's the garbage news, right? Not that mam, it's about garbage. I'll go, mam. Sathish, you seem to be very busy. When the half-an-hour news slot has become full time channels... ...even petty things have to be turned out as news. We must see everything as news. Here, inside... You're struggling to lift this one. You'll know, only if you lift. Turn it. Turn it. Keep on the wood. Sir.... Just a minute, sir. Good, I came late. Else, they would've asked me to lift. You work hard. If you work for a popular channel, we'll be proud of you. It's a locale channel. -wait, I'll come. Why did she ask then? Keep next to the deity's image. Wait... Wait. Okay. Be careful. The handle is towards the wall. We'll turn it. It's okay, leave it. It has to be given as dowry for her. Okay, let's move it aside. Take hundred rupees each. -okay, we'll leave, madam. Shall we leave? Wait. Satish, you... Right from locale channel I'll step up to a popular channel. Not that. Ask Shanti sister to come immediately. Whether I shift the channel or not, I must shift the house. -She keeps saying. Ask her to come immediately. -she would've heard your voice. She will give for us too. -Be quiet. -You guys... Sister, we don't want anything. Had food? Yes. She came to ask that. They thought, you're going to give money. Will I pay for the help rendered by our guys? It's a insult. What guys? Yes, we're leaving. Okay. Lakshmi. -I'm coming. Yeah dear... The shopkeeper will pay for delivering the bureau. Then, why are you paying? If they've left instead carrying it, what can we do? I gave just two hundred rupees for both of them. What's the loss because of that? Those who help us is more important than money. He keeps saying something. -nothing happened so far. -ask him? Hey, don't be in a hurry. The shop owner is here. Start after he leaves. I asked for a tea. It's yet to come. I'm coming. -call him and ask. Mani. If anyone comes to the shop and ask you unusual things... ...call me immediately. Okay, boss. - Tell him too. I'm leaving. -tell me, customer is waiting here. Hey, what the boss said... Take care. -Hey... - he ever says the same. Nothing happened so far. Anandhi. -how much is the full talktime in Vodafone? One hundred and twenty rupees. Why the shop is closed for two days? Have you changed your number? I'm asking you. Yesterday was my engagement. Were you compelled? How to say? What are you going to say? Is it that you're friendly with me all these days? He is my uncle's son. He got a government job as a teacher. I like you. I don't deny. If I sit over and think, It's like I am spoiling my life. Have you ever recharged for just rupees fifty? Think about your job? You'll understand, what I say. Don't you know about my job when roaming around with me? It's time for the customers to come. If you want to create ruckus and spoil my life, Then, stand here. (Indistinct voices) Will you take so long to find out that I'm in the bar? I know well that you'll be in the bar by the way you left. But, I didn't expect this late. Hey, brother. -brother. Tell me. Get me a MC quarter, four water packets and a cup. He has to give the balance, fifty rupees. Take it. (Indistinct voices) I closed the shop an hour before. Coming at eight o'clock is earlier for you? Work is important. Shouldn't we need to earn for survival? I don't want this job. I think, it's better to go to my native place. Are you a goof? You're a free bird. I'm not like that. I must give my earnings to home. Whatever I earn is not for me. She asked me whether I've recharged for fifty rupees so far? How much I've spent for her? You spent by borrowing. Nothing. I heard, what you said. She is also right. I'm in that stance only. I envy the people who are rich. The disease which shouldn't affect humans is frustration. I got that disease. It won't be good, if I stay here after. (Indistinct voices) Where you've to go? -To Porur. No... Sister, why're you here? -Ibrahim. Come on, I'll drop you in home. No. It's okay. -I'll come by auto. Sister, it's okay. Come on. Sit carefully. How is Kavitha's marriage arrangements going on? Good. I'm buying things for her dowry. How many sovereigns of gold are you giving? Upto fifty sovereigns. I bought all the jewels. I must keep all those safely in the locker. I've to give a life to the blind girl. Yes. Don't you have night shift today? Yes, that's where I was going on. As you're standing alone, thought of leaving you in home. Okay. -oh, no. -see there. -get up. Hey, why are you driving in high speed? Are you mindless? Will you drive the vehicle, drunk? Can't you see the vehicle coming opposite to you? Where are you looking at and driving? I'll kill you. You don't know to ride the bike with a woman on pillion. Come on, Ibrahim. Get lost. Else, I'll hit you. You keep talking tales when driving. Then, quarrelling with others blaming they've hit. Reach home safely, wastrel. - Hey, go away. Don't fall again on any other vehicle. (Indistinct voices) Don't blabber. Aren't people who live like us are humans? Everyone who lives here has a secret behind them. I'll tell you the information which you aren't aware. Listen. The person who regularly have watermelon juice in our shop, The egghead? -yes. He left his cell phone in the shop on that day. Then, I was known that he is a spy to the police. Sir, this book... You mean that book? You keep it there. You can't understand, if you read. Then, I ought to read this. You mean, police? He is not the police. He is a spy to the police. Each and everyone has a face like that. But for us? You're the tea master and I squeeze juices. That's all. After my friendship with the egghead, I've known, how the police will deal the cases. (Indistinct voices) The police personnel are very intelligent. Thank you very much. It's okay, sister. What's in this? Oh, no. Ibrahim! -Tell me, sister. My purse is not found. I don't know whether it was missed at the place where we fell. Wait, I'll go and check. Saravanan, what I say? I'm calling home. Be silent. Hello, Saravanan. -are you fine? -Had food? Yes, I had. I'm coming tomorrow. Cook something special for me. Are you coming on leave? No, I've decided to come on the whole. What? What's here for you to come and stay? No need to come, stay there. Are you coming to roam around with the wastrels? What happened? -Mom... He is quitting the job. Give me. Saravanan. Tell me, dad. You've the responsibility to uplift the family. We're a respectable family. It's okay, if you come to do my funeral rites. Dear, give me the phone. -Hello Saravanan. -Are you hearing? Tell me, mom. -why do you want to quit this job now? -your sister is not yet married. -your dad is not well. -stay on, atleast in a job. Hey... Why? Let's search. I got it. Where I had thrown and where are you searching? He has thrown and hitting me. What? Just asked whether we're having food or going to room? Come on. It seems to rain. Come soon. What do you want to eat? I don't want anything. Let's go to the room soon. Your's behaviour is bizarre. Drunk from the morning and broke the phone. He's going... Who's that? Ibrahim. Where? Do you think me as a miser like him? I've money. Hey, Mani... Tell me.. I think the fan may fall down. Why are you laughing? It'll fall on either of our head. If it falls today, it might fall on either of our head. If it falls tomorrow, only you'll be here. I'm going to my home, tomorrow. I've dried the clothes on the terrace. Come, let's take. -You go. I'll hold the fan, if it falls. He is taking my life, drunk. Mani... -sister. I've dried the mat on the terrace. Will you please bring it? - Okay, sister. You're talking without responsibility? Simply saying that you went along with Ibrahim and lost the bureau key. Sister... He searched for it. But, not found. There is another key. Anyway, we'll keep the jewelry in the bank locker on Monday. Leave it. You're careless in everything. I'm doing everything alone. You'll keep poking. Sister... I'm coming. Thank you very much. Saravanan. Oh, he is clear now. What are you doing? Black tea and cigarette for this rain will be rocking. Have it. It's your preparation, you'll praise it.. Hey, isn't it Ibrahim's shirt? Leave it on the terrace. Let it get wet in the rain. Do yourself. Am I an assistant to everyone? Here, you ask me to do the works. If I go upstairs, the owner asks me something to do. She was blabbering that key is lost. Then, she might ask me to search for that too. Hey... What key is that? She was talking about the bureau key. Tell me exactly, what they were talking? Is it her's? May be. Shall we give it? But, if she asks for the money in the purse, what to say? Is this you're worried about? I'm thinking differently. So, we've just one day. Saravanan, are you thinking anything wrong? Then, give this to her. You're thinking about something, what's that? What you're thinking with fear and nervousness... ...I'm thinking the same with ease and patience. Hey, are we going to loot? No. It's risky. If it's not their key? I'm asking you. When we came by walk, Ibrahim was going opposite of us. He might've gone in search of the key. Then, he would've seen us. He might know that we took the purse. You didn't see him. I told you. Likewise, he would've left without noticing us. Though he has seen, it's just we're coming to the room by walk. That's all. You don't afraid of him. I'm just thinking of a plan getting him involved. I can't understand. Ibrahim took the lost key. But, he didn't give it to the owner. No one knows about the lost key. We'll escape letting Ibrahim to get caught in this case, if the police inquires. That is, we'll make the police intelligent and then as fools. Take Ibrahim's shirt. What are you going to do? Generally, the police will find theft cases with small hints. We'll give the evidence. The theft case without breaking the bureau lock. This will be the flash news. When investigated, If the owner complaint about her lost key, Ibrahim's collar button and the thread, everything will match perfectly. Are you thinking how to take it? Have you decided to take it? Then give the key, Go. Okay, tell me. On Monday, with the spare key, she'll keep the jewelry in the bank locker. Hey, just a minute. How does Ibrahim know that the jewels are in the bureau? Thoughtful question. The owner might've told about the importance of the lost key. Okay, leave it. The police will inquire him about that. Why should we bother? Hey, we kept the new bureau. If she had changed the jewelry to that bureau? No chance, Mani. We kept the handle of the bureau towards the wall, do you remember? She'll keep the jewelry in the bank locker on Monday. Just for one day she won't shift the jewelry. That's okay. But, how to take it? When she is not at home. She goes to temple everyday at 5 to 6 o'clock in the evening. At that time only. What about that blind girl? We aren't going to break it, just going to open. Selvam brother too can't move from the bed. Let's manage. Though we take, where to keep it. A bike theft case, Mani. I've read about it. The thief changed the number plate of the bike and left it in the bike stand. After few days, he took that bike and left in another bike stand. He used the bike after the case was shifted to other stance. When he was caught in another case this bike matter was revealed. We're also going to follow the same. There are cloak rooms in the bus depot. isn't it? Yes. We'll keep the jewelry safely there. Then, after few days we'll shift to another bus depot. What you say seems to be very risky. When thinking about this disturbing noise of the fan... ...we can't sleep, Mani. We can't live, if we're afraid of everything. It's a luck for us now. I think, we must utilise it. What do you say? Greedy. The people who are greedy must get destroyed. Why? Already, it's cold because of rain. I can't sleep with fear under this fan. We'll go out tomorrow morning, As soon as we get up. We shouldn't see the owner till evening. We shouldn't be aware about the lost keys through her. No need to go to the shop. Ask the boss for leave. Won't you change in the morning, all these you've planned citing as inebriated? I won't. If I sit over and think, It's like I am spoiling my life. Hey, why are you afraid of her? She is a member in the women's society, isn't it? Yes. She was burning an effigy on that day. When inquired, she said that actor used filthy words in his film. I asked her, even your husband speaks filthy everyday, coming home drunk. Can't you burn his effigy? What you asked is right. Is it right? From then onwards, she is starring at me. Probably, she will burn my effigy. Mani, We are just puppets in this society. To be an effigy we must be rich. I envy the people who're rich. The disease which shouldn't affect the human is frustration. Two idlis. For you? Why the old film is screened? Only old films were screened. Mani, one more thing. If we stay away for long, we'll get caught. Even if we stay close also, we'll get caught. Be careful Is all these necessary for us? I'm afraid. Would you like this film, if the hero utilises the chance he gets? Or not using, out of fear? Are we heroes? I don't know about you. But, I'm the hero for myself... It's a shame if we get caught, isn't it? Everyone will look at me with disgust. A person will be seen normal, until he comes up in life. -Do you need lentil snacks? If he comes up with his hard work, Everyone will talk about his caste and religion... ...instead of his achievements. Not only that, he'll be separated linguistically. How hard you come high in life, these people will odd. If we've to come up, It's not wrong to do something beyond our limits, Mani. After decided to commit mistake, Kavitha's blindness, Selvam's paralysis... ...all these weakness seems to be strengths. God will watch us, whatever we do. That god would've seen us when struggling for food. Let him see. Hello, mom. Saravanan... -tell me, mom. Your sister went for the tailoring class. She wasn't back to home. Everyone gossips that she had eloped with someone. What are you saying, mom? Hey, reduce the volume. Your dad got heart attack on hearing that. -what happened? Taking him to the hospital now. -Don't cry, mom. Are the guys there for help? Yes, Ravi is here. -give the phone to him. I'll give. Speak to him. - Give me, mom. Dear... Hello, tell me dude. Take care of him. -Okay dude, you start immediately. He'll come mom. Is he coming? - Yes. Oh, no! What are you saying? If the marriage doesn't occur at certain age, this will happen. Wonder, you're saying it so normal. Then, you want me to weep like my mom. I'm leaving. First, throw away that key. Nothing is good, right from the time we took it. Brother - Sister. We're going to temple. Pooja at temple. Both you and Saravanan come over there. Sister, Saravanan's father got heart attack. Just now we got a call. Oh, no! Just now Mani told us. Don't be panic. Don't worry, Saravanan. Nothing will happen. Okay, you go immediately. Send him by bus. If possible, come to temple. Come on... Hey, wait... I'll get the lock and key. Hey... Hello... Open the bag. Hurry up. What? Your father is dead. Lineage is Shivam. Kavitha... Star is Ashwini. Zodiac sign is Aries. Sister... Come on, Mani. Just a minute. That's all, Swamy. Have you sent off Saravanan? Yes, as soon as you left. I left him for bus at Koyambedu. Okay. Saravanan's father has expired. Oh, no! What? Got the phone call when on the way to bus stand. Sister, what happened? Saravanan's father has expired. Godess, Lakshmi, come here. Coming. We'll finish the pooja and come. Come. God! Sister, don't worry. It'll be found. Do you know who is the thief? There only. I know. Thief only. Come. Everything is gone. Better die. Get me some poison. I'll also die. I have it, ask me if you want. Shut up. Brother, why are you talking so? We've informed the police. They'll find it out. Mani, I've informed the channel. They're coming. Wear a good shirt. Cable TV? Hey, Saravanan... See your father! Saravanan, you've to do the rituals. Get your clothes changed. It's not like broken theft. Is the key with you? Got a colored thread and button. Is there only one key for this bureau? No, the other key was lost on Saturday night when coming by bike. Sivagami, your daughter has come. Hey, you... Why did you come here? How dare you've come? Look what I'm going to do to you. Mom... Why did you come here? You spoilt... -mom. It's because of you. -fighting on the streets... -Hey, -Saravanan. Leave her. -look at the rites... We'll talk later. Leave, mom. Are you out of your mind? Move away. Why are you shouting? Get her inside. Hey, the one who died is my husband. Get lost. You be quiet, uncle. Hey, I keep saying... Come on. Dad! Sir... Sir, what are you doing? Hey, come. Sir, please. May I know the reason? Shut your mouth. The key was lost when going along with you. You found it. Sir... Last evening, the jewels were there, when they left to temple. You stayed back, saying you're not well... ...and took away the jewels when no one is there. Sir, really I'm not well yesterday. Do you have the doctor certificate? Sir, that's a simple headache. I thought, you'll say some other reason. I'm a Muslim. That's why, I didn't go to temple. Sir, I'm not that sort of person. I'll show you in the police station what sort I'm . Hey, take him. Come.... This is the talent of the Tamil Nadu police! They caught the thief in half an hour. No one is there, sir. What are you looking at? Whose room is that? His room. Hey, come here. Sir... What's your name? Manikandan, sir. Is Ibrahim your friend? No, sir. He stays in the next room. That's all. What is your job? I'm the tea master. Didn't you go for the job? I have to go. It's already late. Are you staying alone? No, sir. Saravanan is here. Both of them work together. Hey, will you get into the vehicle. -no, sir. Shut up. I didn't say anything. My friend, Saravanan is here. He went to his native as his father was expired. When did he go? Last evening, sir. -police can smoke. Didn't you go for your friend's father death? No, sir. Someone must be in the shop. Dad! Dad! Dad, why did you leave us? Anyway, you shouldn't have done this, sister. You traitor... Don't hit her. Sir, I'm speaking from the spot. Tell me. His father has died. Some other problem is going on in home . Leave her. Whatever, let's talk later. Shall I inquire, sir? No... I'll take care. If necessary, I'll tell you. We caught the accused. I'll call you, if necessary. As soon as your friend comes, both of you must come to the station. (Chanting Mantras) Hey... Why didn't you switch on the fan? That is... Leave that. I was almost dead for a week. I got fever because of fear. Touch me. I was feared that everyone looks at me dubious. As you said, Ibrahim was arrested on suspicion. But, I think his uncle has political influence. He came out within a day, don't know whether FIR was filed. He has vacated the room too. It was flashed in news as the job of a new burglary clan. I keep talking. Don't you've an eagerness to know what happened for a week? Did I ask you? It's you saying everything. Okay, is the jewelry safe in the cloak room? No, Mani. I thought there might be problem in that. So, I kept it safely in the place where rituals done to my father. Okay, but, why my phone? I would've switched off the phone, isn't it? You? You can't do, Mani. That owner... We must've thought about it before looting. Now thinking as pityful is a great pity. I didn't think as pityful. Are you thinking so? No... nothing like that. What's that you were about to ask? She might increase the rent citing the reason of lost jewelry. That's why. Hey, I forgot to tell an important information. As soon as you come back, we were asked to come to the police station. Should we go compulsory? Yes, we must definitely go. Else, they'll suspect us. I thought I'll be arrested along with Ibrahim, on that day. But, we were spared, thinking that we wouldn't have stolen... ...as you went to native for father's demise. Better, you keep starring. I must go to work in the morning. I'll sleep. Lot of problems in house. The guy who eloped with my sister... ...his family is yet to accept them. Both of them are staying in our house. My sister is conceived too. Only now she eloped, right? Congratulations! You've become an uncle! Greetings, sir. When were you back? Last night, sir. How did your mother die? Sir! How did your mother die? Sir, not mother, his father has expired. You said as his mother, then. My father, sir. He died of heart attack. We tracked the voice of few cell numbers, regarding this case. He got a call from your number. But, he didn't attend. Then, you didn't call him again. You got call from him and some other numbers. You didn't attend at all. Why? Hey... My phone was lost, sir. I didn't know were i kept. Ring is going on. But, no one attends. I even tried from other numbers. But, no one is attending, sir. I don't know where it is. I was known that his phone got lost only when I called the owner. Mani? -yes, boss. He is here. -give him. Give him. -Mani. Boss - Phone. Saravanan, I ate. How about you? I couldn't hear anything because of the travel noise... ...on that evening, when I called. After getting this month salary, I've to buy a new phone. I'll give you the number as soon as I buy the new one. What's the name of that muslim guy? Ibrahim. He was relieved in bail. Else, I would've peeled off his skin. The losers of the jewellery is not keen on this case. If we get any pressure, I won't talk with you in this module. You must come to the police station whenever called. Go... Hey... Later, you must give your new contact number and your owner's number. Okay, sir. Okay, leave now. I'm leaving, sir. Take that phone. This costs one thousand and four hundred rupees. Is it okay for you? What? You're rocking. Give me your phone. Why? Give me, i ll tell you later. Let it be with me. When you call the shop owner, you talk in my presence. Only then, you won't blabber anything. Give the number to the police, if asked. I'll tell you the rest, later. I would've switched off the phone, isn't it? You...? You can't, Mani. Definitely, you'll blabber if you get a call. Have you tried calling your number? No. I didn't switch off your phone. When the police tracks the calls of your phone, Only the call you made on that evening will be there. I didn't attend that too. How will I call you? The phone is with you, right? I called. Why all these? If you've said the number, their suspicious would've been more. Thats why, I asked you to give. They'll plan to track the calls, only when the phone is working. Let them do. If they ask you about this tomorrow, Tell them, my phone was lost, I tried till yesterday... ...the ring was going on. From last night, it was switched off. Either the charge must be dried or switched off by the one who took it. Okay? Just now, I threw your phone. It was there only. No one took it. Mani, we must let the police to do their job. To show his intelligence, If we give the questions on our own and if we give the right answers too... ...he can't even touch us. I was awaiting for tracking of our calls. I was afraid, that you might get angry when the police slapped me. You mean, angry? I felt funny. Making the weak to get trapped is the trick here. If they get a single evidence, they'll bang us. That too, you'll blabber everything when you're hit four times. I can't even bear two. What's the other evidence? It's there, Mani. Think well. If they get two things, we'll be imprisoned. Hey... Hey... Is it finger prints? On that day, they took finger prints on the bureau. Hey, I did everything with the handkerchief. Not only that, hand prints of the owner and others might be there. It's different. You got it? No, I don't know. If you think well, The police might ask, why we didn't open the shop on the day of theft? What'll you say? You say that too. We can manage even that. One more thing. One who knows well about that house alone can do this. Selvam, who lies inside... ...If a new person enters the house, will the bureau be visible... ...from the place where he is lying, whether he walks or not is not known. It can be done by the one, well versed about the house. If they investigate that way, we both will be in the list. Don't get perplexed. There is a limit to get caught. But limitless ways to escape. He can allow us to open the shop post lunch after 3'o clock. He is asking us to open by 2. Hello. -Saravanan, where are you? I'm in the room, sister. -will you please come upstairs? I'm coming. You get in. I'll come. Come. Be seated. I couldn't even call to inquire about your father's demise. Problems mounted here. Hope you'd have known. Yes, sister. Is everyone in home better? How is your mother? She is okay. See my life! I eloped from my house trusting him. My father died of heart attack as soon as he knew that. Mom. Be quiet. I'm blabbering to my brother. I was not even allowed for the death. My brother Kathir took us home later. He helped me to settle down. Saravanan, -yes, tell me. My brother, Kathir is in Singapore for job. He is coming tomorrow. He is an enraged person. He shouted to the extreme on phone. If he speaks anything harsh tomorrow, please don't take it to the heart. Inform Mani also. That's why, I called you. Okay, sister. I eloped from my house trusting him. My father died of heart attack as soon as he knew that. Mani... Hey, Mani. Where is the book and paper I kept here? I've cleared off those things. Does anyone other than you know that my sister eloped? No. Only the demise of your father was known. Why? Nothing. Hey, what's the owner was asking about? She inquired about my father's demise. Saravanan, a water melon juice. Okay, thank you. Sir... Tell me. My house owner's jewelry is stolen. You too say often, When the police can't find the lost jewelry, They'll settle in another way. Be seated. Sir. Be seated. That guy told that you went home last week as your father expired. Everything happens in a wrong way here. If you ask someone the same query, unnecessarily, you'll be in suspicion. Inspector Eshwar, is investigating this case, isn't it? Yes, sir. He is worst. He doesn't think much. He won't proceed the case unless he's pressurised. If he has to proceed, he'll imprison the people like you... ... who don't have anyone to support and close the case. Your friend is blinking. If we're suspicious, everything will be dubious only. By your unnecessary talks don't create suspicion. This is an unnecessary curiosity, Saravanan. Didn't I tell you, that you've more curiosity. Curiosity kills the cat. Hey, what did he say? First, make your eyes normal. Hey, what did he say? Wait. Hello, Saravanan. -tell me, sister. Are you good? -yes, tell me. Upon checking the horoscope, I was told a female child will be born. My husband's health has to be taken care of. Kavitha's blindness... Had food? I was told a female child will be born. I'm blabbering only to my brother. Uncle's health... All these weakness has turned to be strengths. I was advised to go to temple on every Saturday. That god would've seen us when struggling for food. Let him see. Hello, Saravanan. -okay, sister. More customers in the shop now.. I'll call you later. Okay. Was it from home? Yes. What's the information? Simply. What did the egg head say? You won't understand now. Get lost. Always, saying I don't understand. Who's that in the morning? Where are you from? Where are you working? Where were you when the jewelry went missing? Sir... -I'm asking you. Isn't it? Sir, wait. -Hey, who are you? Where are you working? -I'll tell. Hey, you tell me. Sir. -I'm asking you? You... -hey. Kathir, leave him. Hey, leave him. Sister, be quiet. If we inquire them in the right way, the truth will be revealed. First, you leave from here. Why? Don't mistake him. He is harsh. Who are you? -it's okay, sister. -Who are you? -oh no, Kathir. -Where are you working? -why? -I'm asking, where do you work? -Kathir, leave him. -Why, will you get me a job? -shit. He made me to sweat in few minutes. He is very enraged. Don't worry, Mani. An enraged person can't do anything. Why the owner asked not to open the shop today? Is he suspicious on us? Why are you afraid? How many times to say? He told to close the shop for just one day. Can we ask him the reason? His shop. You panic at everyone... Hey... What are we talking about? How are you, brother? I'm good. Saravanan... Tell me. The bridegroom cancelled the marriage arranged in home. He said he'll get married to the girl whom he was in love. I understood the meaning of love, then. 25G. That's not the bus, I've to travel. But, we have to go by that bus. You stay back and go by the bus you've to. Come on. She says that she understood what's meant by love. Unexpectedly she met me at the bus stop and spoke. Has she come in search of me? I don't know what she understood about love. But, I understood well on the day she left me. Next time, if she would've got married, I might meet her with husband, even with her child... She won't even speak, then. Mani, women's life will move on for next stage. Though, they're willing or not. Not only that, because of another girl, sins piled up on us. What? Nothing. What did you say now? Take the ticket. Two tickets for Mount road. Hello! Dad, I'm Mani speaking. This is my new contact number. Call this number, hereafter. Okay? Hey, Ibrahim! Saravanan! Are you fine? I'm fine, Saravanan. How are you? I heard that your father has expired. So many things has happened. Do you believe me, Saravanan? Definitely, I believe you. Thank you. How is the owner? I met her few days before. When coming back from my prayers. Sister, how are you? Fine. I expected that you'll tell the police that I'm not to be mistaken. That is... It's okay, sister. I understood. What's your stance on that day! But, the tenants in our house is like our family. Don't leave them. Never suspect them. I'm leaving. What I said is right, isn't it, Saravanan? Hey, move. Mani, are you fine? I came along with my friend. We'll meet later. Yes. Bye. -Okay. Why did you meet him? I spoke to him voluntarily. Why are you doing that? I understood, you spoke to him for not being suspicious. Superb! What? Come on, let's go. Have you taken the book, you said about? No, I've to search, hereafter. I thought you'd have been to work. Else, I would've called you earlier. Yeah, why the shop is closed today? I'm not inquiring, just asking. Whatever you speak, is like inquiry. That's why, I asked you both to sit. It's okay. Sometimes, our boss will call us and ask not to open the shop. We don't ask him for the reason. Don't mistake me, I shouted on that day in anger. You would've felt anger, If the theft has occurred in your home too. Lakshmi! I'm coming. It's not a big family. It was decided long ago that marriage is not my life. So, the whole of my life is my sister's family. Thats all... My sister told me earlier, that you both guys are good. The guy who was arrested on suspicion, what's his name? Ibrahim. She says that he is also a good guy. But, I won't believe. Including the god. So many deities here... Has the god stopped the thief? Will the god be the witness? I don't have faith on the police. It's one among the few cases. I don't know whether they'll inquire properly. Yes. Does the cemetery caretaker know the pain of the people... ...weeping in the graveyard? Okay, brother. We're leaving. Bye, sister. Okay. He called us that he wants to talk but inquired... What, brother? Nothing, you go. He called us to talk and inquired. He speaks aesthetically like you. We must be careful. Else, we'd get caught. Hey... Sir asked to bring you. Come on. Why, sir? Sir, a small hint regarding the jewelry theft of our owner's house. A month ago, a guy was starring at the house. Sir,when I asked him, he simply nod his head as nothing and left. Today, I saw him at the signal. I can identify him, sir. I need to give a complaint regarding that, sir. Sir... Sir...The guy who comes to steal from outside, Will he steal when known there is a person inside? He can't get up. He doesn't know, even if see. So, the one who knows about that house... ...and the people has done the theft. Sir, the tea master. Let him sit along with them. Hey, go inside and sit. Go. The past tenants of that house, Those who reside at present, Including who delivers watercans... The search is going on in everyone's house. Even in your native and in relative's houses... ...the search is going on. Sir... (Indistinct voices) Leave us inside. Your son has done a mistake. My son wouldn't have done any mistake.

Greetings, sir. -what happened? Their clan is huge, in Kayalpattinam. -so what? If anything turns as a problem... We don't have search warrant, sir.

Just a minute, sir. Tell me. I'm from press, sir. So what? Just to get introduced. Be seated. No, sir. Sit down. Be quiet. Is that the new phone? Come here. Switch on the speaker. Hey, raid is going on in our house as if you're a big shot. Are you a minister to raid in your house? Go away. That's not raid. It's search. You too switch on the speaker. Tell me, mom. Saravanan, police is searching for something in the entire house. What happened? Don't be panic, mom. Didn't I tell you the jewelry was stolen in the owner's house? That's why, they're searching in the houses of the tenants. Your sister is very much afraid. When the police suddenly entered the house. Don't be afraid, mom. Dad is with us. Okay. Sir, why are you interrogating them? Did I ask you to interrogate them? When the chennai city was flooded, everyone stayed in my house only. Will they steal, sir? Don't shout, simply. Your brother has put pressure to investigate. If we investigate, You shout why do we investigate? Don't I've any other work? I'll imprison you and your brother stating as you hid the jewelry... ...and both enacting a drama. Sir... What? If something gets caught in anyone's house, I'll peel off your skin. Hey, send them out. Go there.Sir, the identity about the person... Go there. Hey, come here. Raid? Go. Sir... Bye, sir. Come, on. I told you earlier, not to talk with him. You went to file a complaint... ...but he threatens you to get surrendered. Yes, sir. What to do now? If he force, tell me. I'll do my best. Okay, sir. Brother, two cups of tea. One with added sugar. What these guys are doing here? Hey, are you having the tea here, as your shop tea is not good. What to do now? Why should we get punished which is not our mistake? What's it about? Nothing. Nothing, Sathish. Be quiet. -you stay quiet. The police is trying to implicate us in the fault which we haven't done. What are you saying? Tell me in detail. Take the tea. Don't turn suddenly. Let him switch on the pen camera. You dare to hit me. I'll show the power of the media. Tell me. The Inspector of C2 Police station is trying to implicate us in the jewelry theft case. The guys of Vadapalani, Chennai was compelled... ... to turn as approvers in a theft case. Whereas, an enquiry commission has been instituted on Inspector Eshwar. When contacted the Inspector, regarding this... How is it? You're rocking! -superb, Satish. When did you took this without our knowledge? That's the brain of the media. The reach of this information wouldn't be vast... ...if telecasted in our channel. Now, the news has got an importance... ...and I too have a chance for a better job in that channel. This is what, two birds worth in the bush. We must learn. It's okay, Sathish. Won't it be a problem for us? Will it be a problem? Will I leave? The media power is unbeatable. Yes... If anyone hits us, Four people will debate on TV about us and will save, isn't it? Am I right, Sathish? Yes, that's it. Saravanan, then... My channel will take an interview of you both. An episode on crime is going on. For half an hour, only you'll be the highlight. We'll increase the TRP rating by modifying the events. Satish, it's superb! In interview, don't say that he asked you to turn as approvar. Add some extra points. Definitely. They won't let me talk for five minutes Is it he? Meditation? Again? I'll come. A flash news from Marina. I'll go for the coverage. Watch the TV continuously. Okay. Don't go for the job. Spoilt... I ll take leave. Hey, why did you say like that to the egghead? He is our trumpet card. Shouldn't the news spread to the department? That's it... Superb! I'm so happy. Everything is over, isn't it? Some things are yet to get over, Mani. What's that still? Two things happen similarly. Similarly, means? Is it double action? How to tell you? Shall we call Kathir brother for booze? No... He speaks as if inquiring. You want to take booze with him? I may blabber. Brother. What are you doing? Is there any A.C bar nearby? Will you take alcohol? Who's that? Kathir brother... Why're you talking about him? What? Nothing, we want to ask whether you can help us to join a good job? Yes, brother. Okay, let's see. Will both of you take alcohol? Why are you blinking? Will you drinK? Come on. Hey, you too come. Did he overhead you? He says the same what you said. Don't know. He has become flat so soon? He ever does the same. He'll become flat in the AC bar. Got used to local bars only. He resembles my friend. But, he is not alive now. Why? What happened? He died in a railway crossing. Leave that. I asked you about Ibrahim. We are not close to him. Don't know, whether he treated us cheap or we thought like that. Not only that, he'll leave before us to the job. You went to your native when the theft occurred, isn't it? Why are you inquiring similiar to the police station? If he was inquired properly, why am I going to question you? Tell me the truth. Did he ask you to be approver? Brother... Will I lie in this? It's all because of Satish. You too... Hey, one repeat. Why am I asking is, The one who is clear that a person is not well in home The one who is familiar with the house plan I told him to enquire the persons who know all these. When he is not interested in this case, How he would've trapped you both in this case? Don't know what's his anger on us? Leave that. Do you know, how would I've investigated this case? Only with finger prints. Why? If the thief has used handkerchief, if even my sister's finger prints and all others... ...who searched in bureau are there? Yes...I didn't think of it. You must have an intelligence to question foolishly. I can't understand. You would've understood. Will you smoke? Where are you from? Pokkampatti near to Madurai. That's not near to Madurai. It's the Pokkampatti near to Tirumangalam. I am familiar about all the places in Tamilnadu. Do you know, Naduvakottai? Yeah, I know. It's near to my place. That's the native of Kumar. Didn't I say, my friend Kumar will behave... ...like your friend Mani. His father is a street play artist. Everyone knows when addressed as... ...Kumar son of Raman, a street play artist. We both struggled in life. He left this world happily in short span of life. I like you both very much. Meanwhile, I'm dubious on you both. What's this still? You can't understand that if I say. You're not in that age too. Come on. Tomorrow morning, I'm going to Trichy for a work. Both of you asked about your job. I remember that. What? Sir, juice. Why are you looking dull? Kathir was the only problem for us. He too left to his native place. I'm going to my home tonight. My father's rememberable day. Has thirty days passed? Then, I got a trustful person regarding the exchange of the jewelry. I'll meet him also. But, you said not to hurry. No, a trustful person is there. It'll be right. I'll meet him. You proceed. I'll take care. The boss will scold as I take leave frequently. Not to worry even if he expels us from job. We'll start a new shop What do you say? "The journey which continues in search of the solutions" "Will it show you the way ahead of the pains?" ...Kumar son of Raman, a street play artist. "The queries which arise within you" "Will it happen as per the fate?" "The mind gets clear whatever the way you choose to go..." "Who are you?" "Go and search, my dear friend..." Brother, just a minute. Where is Kumar's house? You mean, Kumar? Street play artist Raman's son Kumar's house... Is he? The neighbouring house. That house? -Yeah, that one. Don't know whether anyone is there. -They're there. just now seen them. Okay, brother. Sir. Whom do you want? -Kumar... Just wait a minute I will call mom. Mom. Tell me. Kumar? I am his wife. He is no more. Oh, is it! Did Kathir and Kumar worked together? Yeah, the both worked together in Theni. Who is that? Don't know, aunt. Whom do you want? -Greetings, mam. I'm coming from Theni. In the work place of Kumar, the old workers were felicitated... Enough of your felicitation. Did your owner come when my son was arrested by the police? Who are you asking about? I'm saying about Velmurugan, the woodshed owner. Aren't you coming from there? Yes. Then what? To find out the real culprits, my son and Kathiresan suffered a lot. Aunt, leave it. No one came to our house from the locale. Don't cry aunt. -that Kathiresan... "Come on...come on..." "The life like a king is not a puzzle..." "The success is not far away..." "Come on...come on..." "The life like a king is not a puzzle..." "The success is not far away..." "Come on...come on..." Has anyone worked as Kathir and Kumar... ...in this wood shed, some twenty five years ago? "Everyday, for your sake, the truth lives hiding itself..." "Till then, your search will extend... Come on..." Where is the Zamin house you mentioned about? That zamindar's house is in that street. -There? Yes. Let this bag be here for sometime. okay. "The sleep fade away from the eyes" Who are you? What's the matter? Nothing sir, To know about any changes in the investigation... ...in theft case which happened twenty five years ago... ...and in the theft case happened now, I've come to write an article about that. What's that investigation? They arrested the servant in the home. "The journey which continues in search of the solutions" "Will it show you the way ahead of the pains?" "The queries which arise within you" "Will it happen as per the fate?" We didn't get back anything stolen. We didn't get back anything stolen. Wonder, what's that you investigate? Shall I get some water, please? Give him water. "Who are you?" "Go and search, my dear friend..." Mom! "Come on...come on..." "The life like a king is not a puzzle..." "The success is not far away..." "Come on...come on..." "Come on...come on..." "The success is not far away..." Uncle! Get up... Uncle! Get up... Saravanan, I can't breathe. Get up... I'll leave mom. Okay. Take care. Come often, Saravanan. Take care sister. I'll leave. - Okay Everything went well? Hey, have you exchanged the jewelry? What happened? I keep asking you. Okay, leave it. It's clear in your face. You asked me to be patient, but you hurried? You could've done this patiently with the right person. Why are you switching it off? It's cold. Why you need? You mean, cold! Okay, what happened? Whom did you meet? Is the jewelry safe? I keep asking, but you... I keep asking, but you... What happened? Mani, there is a theory called as "Coincidental". What I'm asking and what you're saying? I'm replying your question. Listen. Okay, tell me. Coincidence is the similar incidents occurred to the... ...descendants of the different families. We can't say for how many generations it'll persist. If it shouldn't continue, It should end at a focal point. What? I just asked whether you've exchanged the jewelry? Instead, you're blabbering as descendants, focal point and illicit affair. Hey, that's a coincidence. A kind of law in science. Why are you talking about science to me? Hey, I'm saying about ourselves. Right from the moment, I thought of stealing the jewelry, the incidents happening at my house… ...related to me is the same as the... ...incidence occuring at the owner's house. Thoughts and deeds are continuing as the same. To say you clearly, My family's stance is like the Xerox copy of the owner's family. Hello, mom. Saravanan... Your sister went for the tailoring class. Everyone gossips that she had eloped with someone. I eloped from my house trusting him. Your dad got heart pain on hearing that. My father died of heart attack as soon as he knew that. I wanted to know whether it happens only because... ...I decided to steal the jewelry… …or is there any other reason? If I know that, only then I can stop the next incidents... ...which occur similarly. I don't understand. How to make you understand? What happened to my sister has happened to the owner. What I did was done by Kathir. Still to make you understand, I'm doing what Kathir has done. Then, why shouldn't Kathir have stolen similar to me? To know this, Kathir's friend, Kumar... Me? I went to Naduvakottai, to know about Kumar who died in the railway crossing. Kathir and Kumar worked together. For a theft case, in chieftain's house, police arrested both of them. But the police arrested Murugan who was working in that house, And let both these guys freely. Only after, I went to that chieftain's house, I came to know that, I asked my mom what happened? Your father fought with your grandfather that Murugan wouldn't have done that. But, your grandfather didn't heed. I would've pushed you out of the house when you got married to other caste girl. Now, are you talking as a communist supporting the low caste guy. Get out of the house. He brought up you without any traces of it. When I asked him why? We have come with dignity to lead a life. Instead of knowing me as a heir of Rangarajan Zamindar Who was enslaved by the British, I feel proud to know to my posterity as a poor farmer. He was worried in his death bed, that he can't lift his family. That's why he kept saying that we're from a honoured family. One day, you'll find out the roots of your... ...lineage by your knowledge. He asked me to say everything, then. It was Kathir and Kumar, who had stolen the jewelry from my house. They trapped Murugan into this, like how we trapped Ibrahim. What's the evidence for everything you say? What's the evidence for our stealing? After twenty years, when I settled down well in life, if anyone asks... ...will I say that I did burglary or I'll say that I worked hard? You're not involving me in anything. If the incidents continue, you'll not be alive, Mani. Hey, Then, will I die like Kumar? And your niece will be blind like Kavitha and your brother-in-law will be bed ridden. Hey, Mani... I'll laugh like that only. I'll laugh amidst of everyone. I'm silent because our theft might get revealed Better, you go and consult a doctor. You've got a different disease. Like something said in films. To be right, you are acting foolishly to show your intelligence. When your father was ill, you planned to steal, Is that to challenge the police? What you've is not the mind of the thief. It's the mind of the police you befriended with that egg head. Whatever you planned to steal and to escape is to show your intelligence. Now also, you went to exchange the gold. But, you say as focal point, coincidence... Just wait... You said, if it shouldn't continue, You need a focal point. That means, you're going to give back the stolen jewelry to the owner, isn't it? Don't speak like a goof. Am I a goof? You're going to do that only. You're going to give the jewels away, thinking anything won't happen. Will I give? I just said, I came to know these things. If I give the jewels back, will they leave me? I was disturbed, as the jewels which were denied by my father, was in home. That's why I brought it back? Did you bring it back? It's not in there. As per our previous plan, I've kept it in a bag and locked it in cloak room. Even when it was in house, it was safe from the eyes of police. You only said, that there's a risk to keep it in cloak room. Now I can see all the ways in which we'll be caught. They won't find on their own. This lunatic is going to surrender it to the police. I don't trust you. Hey you, The receipt for the cloak room is in my purse. If you want, you yourself have it. I don't have the idea to return it to the owner. Don't think like a fool. Come and sleep. Okay, I'll accept whatever you say. The jewels you stole is yours. The jewels that were stolen from your house has come back to you. Don't confuse yourself by thinking about this, any longer. I've told you clearly, that we'll talk in the morning. Shut your trap and sleep. For what I'm trying to tell is... Switch the lights off and keep blabbering. It's cold. It's okay. What did you ask that day, while watching the movie at theatre? Will you like, if the hero doesn't use his opportunity? Will the hero get confused like this? I'm not confusing. I'm speaking clearly. Oh, no! Kavitha! What's this? Why have you done this? Someone please come... What happened, sister? -See, what she has done! Lift her. Coincidence means, The similar incidents will occur to the descendants of different families. That should end at a focal point. The moment I thought of stealing the jewelry, Whatever happens in my family related to me... ...and whatever occurring at the owner's house. The thoughts and deeds are continuing as the same. Saravanan, I can't breathe. Why shouldn't Kathir have stolen like me? Kathir and Kumar has stolen in my house. How we made Ibrahim as scapegoat, similarly Murugan was caught there. Is she better now, sister? Yes, they said she is better. Sister, I don't want any jewelry. If you agree, I'll marry Kavitha. Yes, I'm getting a call. Just a minute. Tell me, sister. Are you mad? Why are you in hurry? Wait for some time. I'll conduct her marriage finding a good bridegroom . That's not, Kathir... Who is that? -won't you listen? My brother. Give me. -don't do everything as you wish. Won't I take care? Without enquiring about him, you're talking about marriage. My father's name is Rathinam. My grandfather's name is Rangaraj. Everyone in Theni knows about Rangaraj Zamindar. Don't you know, who is familiar about all the places in Tamil Nadu? Now, he'll accept, sister. If you go home, inform my husband that Kavitha is well. He'll keep blabbering. Okay, sister. Saravanan, how is Kavitha? Better now. -excuse me. Is she good? -Yes, good. In which room is she admitted? -201. Come, let's go. -Go. Hey, you... Where did you go, goof? Where did you go? Hey, Mani... First you tell me, where did you go? Kavitha slit her hand. Okay. Admitted her in the hospital. Okay. If everything must go well, I thought, it's right to get married to her. That's why, I told the owner voluntarily that'll marry her. That is, your focal point! Mani, I'm furious on you. I'm not at all angry on you. I feel so proud. You got it now, isn't it? Wait, you'll steal the jewels... ...and to take up the remaining property, you'll marry that blind girl. I'm the only person left alive who knows the truth. You'll kill me too. -Hey... I'll say that. You'll tell that I died in railway crossing as it happened to Kumar. Enquire well. That Kathir might've killed Kumar. Similarly, you'll also kill me. You've taken the bag, isn't it? This bag, right? See well... Nothing is in this bag. Hey, you brought this bag by mistake. I know, what you'll say. Don't act. Where is the jewelry? Don't talk foolishly, Mani. Are you dubious on me? Dubious? Your whole body is accumulated of lies. You lied about going to Theni, saying that your father is a Zamindar. Everything was lie. You're talking too much. I'll talk like that only. Your father is not a Zamindar. He is a beggar. Not only that, your sister had eloped. After one year... Hey, come front. Not you, sir. You sit there. It's you... Come front. Hello, Saravanan. Tell me, sister. The baby smiles at your image. She won't let you go next time when you come home. Just wait a minute. I'm getting a second call. I'll call you later. Okay, Saravanan. -Hey dear, look at dad! I'm leaving to office. Dear, uncle is coming home. -take it, son-in-law. Come on, dear. Come on... Tell me, -Are you coming home for lunch? Yes, I'm coming for lunch along with my friend. Cook for him too. Okay. I'll hang the call. Okay dear. It's been a year since I met him. Still he is dubious and angry on me. But, I'm not dubious on him. Because, he isn't that much intelligent. But, on that night, whatever he said about me... ...made me to realise myself. Hey... When will you start the vehicle? Let the people come. Why are you in hurry? To say the truth, I was staying away not to meet him. What happened on that night... Get in. You've place here. Come this way. Sir, keep your bag up. No, let it be here. Sir, there's no place to sit. Give the bag. Keep it there. Sir, be seated. Sit along with him. Let the child sit on lap. Dude, come back. He'll kill me, if I say the bag got changed. That's why, I wantedly fought with him. Because, he will go in search of the one who sat next to me. I don't even remember that face. Oh, no! what's this? Show me. Leave it. It's for my dear daughter. If god grants us, it'll be like a blind luck. No need, we'll handover it to the police. I know how my father suffered because of the police. Not only that, if something comes to us on it's own... ...there'll be a justice. I asked you to sit in front to talk with me. Do you have a job or not? You're good enough to get the support of in-law. Didn't you leave this reading habit yet? "I got the solution" Only half of the book is remaining. You don't know to read. What are you doing with that? I too read by spelling out the letters. "Mistakes..." You stay with me. You drive the vehicle for half of the day. Agree to it.
