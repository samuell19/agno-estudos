He's a little edgy. Well, is there anything that you could recommend? Raisin toast.Mmm. Bring me some of that then. ROB: Yes, bring me some, too, please. Anything else? Yes. A breath of your perfume. You see, the truth is, I'm deeply intoxicated with you and I'm desperately trying to make you fall in love with me. Love doesn't come out of desperation. Besides, I'm already in love with your quiet friend here. [KISSES EMPHATICALLY] PHIL: Whoa, Rob. Two for two in two days, very nice. My God. That woman is amazing. Did you guys get a look at her? There's a lot of mileage there, boys. Very low Blue Book. GENE: Is that all you think women are for, just for sex? "Fucking," Rob. You're 22, you can say "fucking." Shh, shh, shh. MARY: Here's your relish tray. It's complimentary. For a reason. Nice eye. Want me to draw you a mouth? Oh, you have a sense of humor. [MARY CHUCKLES] Mary, do you know, is there a good motel somewhere close by? Yeah, there's a real cute little place down the road about a mile. If you wanna hang around for a while I get off in about six hours. I think we can find it. ROB: That's nice, because we're gonna be sticking around here for a couple of days. We're probably gonna stick around for maybe a week. Are you kidding? Here? Do you know where you are? I tell you what, you look like real nice boys to me, how about I give you my phone number? We are. We're nice boys. PHIL: We're extremely nice boys. We only kill people for fun. But it's in a nice way. This one has a nasty streak. Deal with your past. You'll feel better. Please. What are you doing? My clothes were dirty. He's getting worse. What are you talking about? Look at him, Gene. Just look at him. That's what I'm talking about. You're not a doctor yet. You don't know anything. I know what I see. You don't know jack shit. Yeah. Well, fuck you, too. Oh, Rob, the "F" word? What's your father gonna say? Gene, for cryin' out loud. Phil is dying. Shut up. He is dying. Shut the hell up! Rob, come on. I didn't mean that. [DOOR SLAMS] [ROB PLAYING PIANO] MARY: Oh, I just love a man who can make music like that. [CLEARS THROAT] It makes me quiver in all my quivery places. We used to, um, have a singing group in high school, and I was kind of like Ringo, but they were like Paul and John. They really wrote some incredible stuff. What happened? That's a good question. ♪ There are two things ♪ I can't stand ♪ And one of them is your mom ♪ What is just as bad is your dad ♪ Why did we have to come?

You mean what's a nice girl like me doin' in a dumpy place like this? Or what's a dumpy girl like you doing in a nice place like this? You see, I've been working my way west for the past 10 years, but there are so many places that need artistic improvement, it has really slowed me down. Artistic improvement? Yeah, I'm a painter. I work big. I see ugliness someplace, I want to cover it up. You know, I, like, have to. Wait, hold it. You didn't paint that big building out the there, did you? Yeah. Do you like it? It's amazing. Hey, listen, will you do me a big favor? When you get out there to California, would you send me a postcard from Hollywood? Yeah. I think we could do that. Thanks. [FORK DROPS] Hey, Mary. I don't even know what your last name is. It's Klinglitch. With a "K." Klinglitch? Klinglitch? We're out of here. Oh, God! I, uh, forgot to leave the tip. The tip. I left the tip. What's he see in her, man? I think it's her good looks that wore him down, but it's the "Klinglitch" that killed him. Hiya, dolls! Hi. Hi. PHIL: Mary Albert Klinglitch? MARY: Yeah, it's pretty bad, isn't it? You see, when my mom was pregnant, she was convinced I was twins, you know, a boy and a girl, so she picked out the names Mary and Albert, but I was the only one who showed up. Right. Any brothers or sisters? Yeah, eleven older brothers. Mom called it quits after me. Two little, too late. Ooh! I'm up for stopping for a brew. Anybody else? No, no, I'm definitely ready. ROB: I'm always thirsty. MARY: I got my drinking shoes on. PHIL: Okay. That's it then. Hang a Ringo.GENE: Let's go! [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ Well, it's Saturday evenin' and I'm feelin' kind of tight ♪ I'm in need of some partyin' tonight I'm surprisingly not that thirsty anymore. In fact, I think I have an excess of bodily liquids. Phil, let's get out of here. No, no, no, no. This is very nice. Barkeep, could I please have some beers for my friends? And I will have a Long Island Iced Tea. We only got beer. Very well then, if that's all you got, I'll make mine a beer.

A toast to the Hell Hole, the most appropriately-named place in the United States. BOTH: To the Hell Hole. Oh, boy. What? Hey. Hey, those are the same assholes that ran us off the road. You know, buddy, it's probably not them. No, no, no, no. No, that's them. I'm just gonna go over and say "hello." Phil, just forget about it. No, no. Don't worry about it. Hello. My name is Phillip W. Stepler. I believe we've run into each other before, on the road of life. Literally. I was just wondering if you know how fucking irresponsible it is to run people off of the fucking road? You hear what I'm saying, you fuck? You stick me one more time, dickhead, and you're gonna eat that finger. Something tells me we're never gonna make it to California. Listen, you don't wanna fuck with me, 'cause I'm fucking [BLOWING RASPBERRY] I'm looney. I'll reach down your throat and rip your neck out through your mouth! Do you hear what I'm saying? You think you're tough? Do you wanna see tough? I'll show you tough. We're dead. He is unreal. There, huh? I just gave your bitch a tonsillectomy. What do you think of that? Huh? That's my bitch. Whosever. Oh, beautiful. Everybody wants a piece of me? I don't give a shit, 'cause I'm gonna die anyway. So I might as well take as many of you fuckers with me as I can. [ALL EXCLAIMING] Ha! Ha! I warned you not to fuck with me. MAN 1: Oh, shit! MAN 2: Crazy... Me and my associates, hi, are leaving now. But we will be back. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. Maybe in your worst nightmares, we'll be there. Give me a six-pack to go. Chop-chop. Ring-ring. Well, we lived. [LAUGHING] GENE: You are radically insane. How did you get that fire to come out of your mouth? What an incredible feeling of power! Does anybody have any Binaca? Okay. Drive. All right. GENE: Here's an appropriate category. "Songwriters." He wrote Be My Baby. Who is Phil Spector? He wrote Swanee River. Who was Stephen Foster? Oh, man, you've always been a what-do-you-call-it of useless information. Font. Right. Do you remember that episode of The Honeymooners where Ralph goes on the game show? Yeah, I think I saw that. Yeah, and he practices before the show by having Ed drill him on the piano, and Ed can't play anything without playing a few bars of Swanee Riverfirst? And when Ralph goes on the show and they ask him who wrote Swanee River... And he said, "Ed Norton." Right, I saw that. Don't worry, Phil. That's not gonna happen to you, man. You know everything. Yeah. Except why this is happening to me. I mean, that's why I want to be on Jeopardy, because they give you all the answers, and all you gotta do is come up with the right questions. So... MARY: I thought I'd sleep in the van. Mary, I would really like... I would love to be with you tonight. But I have to stay with Phil. Why are all the good men married or gay? No. No, it's not that. [SIGHING] Yeah? Then what? Phil and I have been buddies since we were little kids, we grew up together. He's my best friend. So? So... He's dying. GENE: Hey, hey. When she gets through with this, she's gonna batter your corndog. Lick? You're such a booger. Why do men always use women as a male bonding experience? What do you know about men? Enough to know a man who hates women when I see one. Yeah? Well, maybe I just hate you, doll. PHIL: Hey, hey, Gene. Look, man, I can't take this... Would somebody please tell me what we're doing with her? ROB: I invited her. Well, this if for Phil, and Phil no longer wants her with us. I don't mind that she's here. She's a pain in the ass, Phil. She shouldn't be sharing this with us! Why are you talking about me like I don't exist? You don't. Don't you ever take time out from being a jackass? Look, shut up. PHIL: Guys, seriously, stop this. Come on. ROB: What is it with you, Gene? Are you pissed because you haven't slept with her yet? Hmm?PHIL: Rob... Are you kidding me? I wouldn't touch her if it'd save one of Jerry's Kids. Really? I mean, you know that I like her, so why don't you just sleep with her? Oh, man, I don't want to hear this anymore. Don't give me this... It never seemed to bother you with Stephanie. It just seems to me that everyone I like, you sleep with. No, man, I did you a favor with her! Oh, come on.PHIL: Hey. What if you married that chick and then you found out about her? You self-justifying bastard. Do you have a clue as to how big an asshole you are? I'm an asshole? You are an asshole. I'm a butt-head? You are a big asshole, Gene. Give me a break, Rob!
