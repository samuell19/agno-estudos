(ominous music) (laboured breathing) (footsteps thumping) (items clattering) (panting) (grunts) (laboured breathing) What... what have you done? (calm music) Hey, honey. I'm on my way home. (sigh) Amazing. I'm absolutely starving. What the hell? (sigh) (ominous music) Oh, come on! (sighing): God... Hi, guys! Hey, honey. How was school? - It was fine. - It was good. Bad day? Someone smashed the car window in and there's glass all over the back seat. What? My God, this neighbourhood. We really are... I think about moving. Yeah, well, you might need to win a lottery first. I'll take it in tomorrow morning. See if Jay can fix it. We can't afford that right now. Get ready to try the pasta I made. It's delicious. You stirred the pot a couple times. That doesn't count. Yes, it does! Uh, thank you guys for helping your dad. (Charles): My little sous-chefs. So, I have a few more late nights this week. Marcia's still off and I said I'd cover. Okay. I'll switch my schedule around. I'll pick Finn up from school. I could always get him. What about your extra calculus lessons? I can miss them for a week if it helps you guys. Absolutely not. Those lessons are important. But I wanna help. You do enough. And besides, best thing you can do for this family is ace those exams and get into college. He's right, sweetie. We've managed this far. (phone ringing) Oh, hold on a second. What happened to no phones at dinner? I'd be in so much trouble if I did that. Well, it must be important. Who's hungry? - I am! - I'm starving. - All right. Thank you. That was the Tulip House. It was about my dad. They said they have some new information to discuss. Who's Tulip House? It's an adoption agency. You're adopting? What about us? No, it's an adoption agency that your mom was adopted from when she was little. They said they have some information about my dad. I thought you said you didn't know anything about him. I don't. I've never really even known his name, but maybe he might wanna meet me. (hopeful music) (exhale) Okay. Who wants pasta? (doorbell chimes) Bill Porter from Tulip House. Is there somewhere we can sit? - Yes, sir, right upstairs on the left. - Perfect, thank you. You said you were here about my dad? Has he made contact? Does he wanna meet me? Yes and no. I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your father, Lionel. Lionel Fitzpatrick was his name. I'm very sorry to tell you that he's passed away. (melancholic music) He passed? When? About six weeks ago now. He had a heart attack. I'm sorry it's taken so long for you to be told. It took quite a while for all the formalities to be completed and for his lawyer to find us. Yeah, I see. (sobs quietly) I'm very sorry to be the bearer of such sad news. So, if he's passed, why did y'all need to get in touch with us? Well, here's the thing. Mr. Fitzpatrick was quite comfortable, financially, I mean. Extremely comfortable, you could say. And he had no other family at all, so you're his next of kin and he left everything, everything he had, to you. He left me some money? Well, how much are we talking about? I don't have the exact figure, you'll have to talk to his lawyer when you finalize the paperwork, but it's quite a lot. Millions. What? That's not all. So, he was our granddad, but he died? That's right. And it's okay to be sad, even though you didn't know him. I'm sad too. I wish we'd all gotten to meet him. But if you never knew him, why did he choose to leave everything to you? I don't know. I guess because I'm his only remaining family. I still don't know why he chose me. But the money isn't the only thing. He also left us his house. But it's a little far, like out of the city, and if we moved there, you'd have to start new schools and you wouldn't be able to see your fr... Where is it? In a place called Blanca Bay. It's about two hours upstate, but it's by the beach. Are you for real? - Whoa! Is that the ocean? - He lived there? I don't know about this. It doesn't feel right. I mean, he must've chosen you for a reason. Maybe it's a fresh start for us. Lionel's gift to you. I just wish I could talk to him. Thank him for changing our lives. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Maybe the only way we can thank him is by making the most of the situation. - Yeah. - Think of all we could do. I mean, Finn could go to the best schools. Heather, she could pick any college she wants. You can get back into photography, maybe open up your own gallery like you always talked about. I mean, this is a chance at a better life. A new life. (soft chuckle) All thanks to Lionel. You're right. All thanks to my dad. Should we do this? Yes. So... what do you guys think? Should we do it? Should we move to Blanca Bay? Yes! Yes! Yes! (laugh) Are you kidding? Who wouldn't wanna live there? Looks like paradise! (laugh) I know. Ooh, I'm so excited! (calm music) (birds chirping) Whoa! (laugh) It's huge! Oh, my God! Is there a pool? - Race to you the top! - No fair! You got a head start. (gasp) - This... - Okay. Is amazing! - Come on. - Oh. (laugh) (chilling music) (scoff) Okay. All right. Okay. You must be the Nolans. - Hey! - Hi! (bright music) It is so nice to meet you finally! I'm Rebecca Jones. I'm Molly, and this is my husband, Charlie. And the two blurs that ran past you were Finn and Heather. You must be the realtor the lawyer mentioned over the phone. If you need help with a house in Blanca Bay, I'm your woman. Now, you must be keen to take a look around. But first, these are for you. Welcome to your new home. Thanks. Right this way. (ominous music) (sigh) Oh, my gosh. (sigh) Here we are! (footsteps stomping) - Dibs on the biggest room! - No fair, we said flip a coin! (sigh) Would you look at that. It's breathtaking, isn't it? We kept all the furnishings just as Lionel had them. The flooring here is a custom imported marble. And all of the fittings are custom-made. And if you will look over here, I took the liberty of adding a little personal touch. - Where did you get this? - Oh, my God. This is so sweet! I just thought you should feel at home. Thank you. We'll have to find a special place for it. (gasp) Hello. I'm sorry. I didn't realize anyone else was here. Molly, Charlie, this is Grace, the housekeeper. Housekeeper, I'm... not sure that we need... Or did you already have staff you wanted to keep on? - No. No. - Uh-uh. I... I don't think we need anyone picking up after us or... Whoa, whoa, hold on, Molly. This place is huge. And Grace is already here. And it's totally normal. Everyone here has help. Trust me, after a few days, you won't know how you lived without it. I can help with the cooking and the cleaning. You won't have to worry about a thing. I guess... (chuckles) okay, then. We'll just see how it goes. Perfect! Well, how about I show you around? I can take this from you, Mrs. Nolan. Thank you. Right this way. (ominous music) And right through here is Lionel's study. What's all this? Oh, I'm sorry, I thought the lawyer said you wanted his possessions left behind. Isn't that right? Yeah. No, it's fine. I asked them to leave his things so I could look through it all. I hoped I could, I don't know, get a sense of who he was. Did you not know him? Lionel and my mom split when I was a baby, and then, she died shortly after, so I never got to ask about him. I never even knew his name until a few days ago. Well, I'm so sorry to hear that. One thing I can tell you is that this was his favourite room. He designed it himself. So, you knew him? I only met him once. He had a bit of a reputation. What kind of reputation? He was quite a private person. Didn't get out much. But he wrote a lot of letters. Do you have any of them? They should be here in these boxes. You might find them a bit dry, though, I'm afraid. Lionel was on the local chamber of commerce and I think he spent most of his time complaining to the board about everything they had planned. Do you know if he left behind any other important documents? Well, everything should be here, but I can check with the lawyer. Hey. What are you looking for? If he wrote letters, then maybe there's something in there that explains why he left. Why I never knew him. I just have a few more papers for you to sign. Why don't we finish up the tour, and then, I can get out of your hair. Hmm. Shall we? Now, I think you're really gonna love this space. The kitchen is my personal favourite. Yes! - I can't believe we get to live here. - Wow. (ominous music) What is this? I don't know. "You don't belong here." What the hell? - Who would wanna... - Mom? What's wrong? (shaky breathing) (gasp) What's going on? Take your brother outside, Heather. Please. Finn, come on. (door creaking) (door closing) Someone was in here. I am so sorry. I don't know how this could've happened. Someone clearly is threatening us. I-I will fix it. I'll have Grace clean this up. You... you don't need to worry about anything. Do you know who would've written that? No! N-no, of course not. But... What is it? (sharp exhale) Well, um... I don't wanna start rumours, and I can't say for sure, but I will say that not everyone was pleased about you being here. About Lionel leaving you his house and his money. What do you mean? I thought he didn't have anyone else. They told me I was his only family. I suppose, technically, that is true. But Lionel did have a fiancée, a woman named Darla Weaver. When she found out that Lionel cut her out of his will and didn't leave her a penny, well, she was furious. Do you think this Darla Weaver could've written that message? Maybe. All I know is that she has quite a temper. Why did someone write that? (sigh) I don't know. So creepy. Why don't you take your brother and walk into town? Get us some snacks. I'm not hungry. Please? I think it would be good to get him out of the house for a bit. Maybe it'd do you both some good? I'm fine. I could really use your help. (sentimental music) All right. Thanks. Do you think they have donuts? I mean, it's a coffee shop, Finn. Of course they have donuts. (laughs) Thank you. (sigh) Come on, let's get some drinks. (indistinct chatter) Did you see that? He just walked right out. That's so brave. It's not brave to steal. Hey, I made you some... (sigh) Grace beat you to it. And she's already cooking dinner. She's great. I thought I smelled something good. Do you think it's weird leaving her to do everything? I'm not complaining. How's it going? Well, like Rebecca said, these are all just angry letters to the Chamber of Commerce. He must've had a lot of enemies. Do you think someone from the board could've written that message on the wall? I think they'd be happy he's gone. Angry people don't think straight sometimes. Yeah, that's true. I don't know, I just wish I could find something that tells me who he was. What he liked, disliked. Or anything about my mom. - Your mom? - Yeah. I've always wondered why they broke up. Was it because of me? So, that's what this is all about. I just wanna know where I come from. Lionel was the last chance I had to find any answers, and now he's gone, too. I don't even know anything about him. (clicks tongue) You know what? You can learn a lot about a person from the books on their shelves. Let's check it out. (curious music) He obviously was a big reader. Recipe book. Let's see, we've got history. Hey, "Through a Camera's Eye." I wonder if he was a photographer? Like father, like daughter. "To Lionel, I will love you always. From S." I wonder who S was? My mom's name was Sarah. Do you think it's from her? Well, if he's kept it this long, she must've meant a lot to him. Then where was he all this time? If he had such an amazing life, why didn't he want me to be a part of it? (heavy sigh) (pensive music) It's weird to think that someone was in here, leaving us that message. Who would wanna scare us? I'm sure it's just some rich kids playing a prank on us. We're getting the locks changed, so don't worry. It's gonna be okay. Come here. I don't know. I just can't get it outta my head. Well, we're not going anywhere. They're gonna have to deal with us. I love you. I love you, too. (crickets chirping) Grace? (tense music) Hey, babe. You okay? Yeah, it's nothing. I'm gonna lock up. I'll be right there. Okay. (door locking) (suspenseful music) (birds tweeting) - Ooh, what are you making? - Ah, ah, ah, ah, breakfast first. Since when do you bake? Well, I found a recipe book in Lionel's study. I thought it'd be nice to try one of his recipes and take some cookies around the neighbourhood. Say hello to some folks. Well, where's Grace? Couldn't she make them? I wanted to do these myself. No need to bother her with it. But it's her job, Mom. Heather, if you wanna make a good impression, it is all about the personal touch. You'll see. Okay, these are all ready to go. Have a good day at school. Love you. (birds tweeting) (calm music) (doorbell chime) (happy exhale) Thank you. I love an unexpected guest. Hi, I'm Molly Nolan, your new neighbour. Oh? How nice to meet you. I'm Justine Spencer, yes, of the New Hampshire Spencers. Right. Hmm. I just thought I'd come by and introduce myself and bring you some of the cookies I made. Aren't you quaint. I'm sorry? Making your own cookies. My chef would have a fit if I stepped foot in the kitchen. I always make such a mess. I thought people might appreciate the personal touch. I couldn't possibly. You know, all fat gluten. Nasty stuff. Oh. I'm sorry. Tell me about yourselves. What does your husband do? He's a professor. How charming! Where does he teach? Clarkstown Community College. Community college? He's taking a break right now. We're both having a bit of a career rethink. I quit my job when we moved here and well, it's a bit silly maybe, but I've always wanted to have my own photography gallery. Not just for my work, of course, but just to showcase local artists. You're a photographer? Would I have seen you exhibited anywhere? Oh, gosh no, I wish. I once had a feature in a catalogue, but that was before the kids. A catalogue. I see. (chilling music) Well, uh... it was nice to meet you. I'd better get going while the cookies are still warm. Got lots of houses to get to. I imagine this is all quite overwhelming. All this. Total culture shock, you could say. Well, Blanca Bay isn't for everyone, and there's no shame in admitting that. It's a quite exclusive community. Usually. Well, I'm sure I'll see you around. I guess I'll just take these back home. (ominous music) So, what do you think? Well, I think it's perfect. When Charlie told me you were looking for a gallery space, this is the first place that came to mind. I think you're gonna fall in love with it. Shall we take a look inside? Come on! The space is quite a find. Now, it is a little stripped down after the previous tenant, but just imagine how amazing this wall would look with a few pieces on it. And you could use the space in the back for an office, whatever you like. What is it? You don't like the space? No, it's not that. I feel like I made a fool of myself this morning. What do you mean? What's wrong? Our neighbours, they're just so... I have no idea what to say to them. Molly, I'm sure you were fine. They just need to get to know us, that's all. And besides, look at this. This is ridiculous! (chuckle) I know. I mean, this could be your new art gallery. And it's all thanks to Lionel. He made this possible. I know, you're right. Just scary. I feel like the new kid at school again. So, what do you think? It's what I've always dreamed of. Better, even. I knew you would love it. (sigh) I can't believe it. My own gallery? (laugh) You were right, Charlie. It's all thanks to Lionel. He left you that money for a reason. Rebecca, can you call the landlord and set up a meeting? My pleasure. Oh! Oh, hello. I didn't expect to see you here. Yeah, the idiots you hired to move my things left some stuff behind. Oh, I am so sorry. I could've arranged for them to come back and... Who are you? Do we know each other? Don't tell me. Did we meet at the Alton's last 4th of July party? No, I'm Molly Nolan and this is my husband, Charlie. We just moved here. You're Lionel's daughter? That's right. And who are you? Molly, this is Darla Weaver. - Oh. - You've heard of me? I'm so sorry for your loss. What are you sorry for? You never even knew him. I was his fiancée. I was the one he actually chose to have in his life. Wow, oh... okay. Well, um, I know Molly would love to hear about Lionel, what he was like. Would she? Well, he's gone now. He made his choice. So, why are you here? The Nolans are interested in leasing the building. Molly has plans for a gallery. (sly chuckle) A gallery. Good luck. No one's lasted in this building very long. Did you hear about his house? Lionel's house? Someone was in there and they wrote a message, "You don't belong here." Someone broke in. Are you accusing me? (ominous music) In Blanca Bay, it matters what the community thinks of you. I would be very careful and watch what you say around here. Great meeting you. (scoff) What does that mean? Darla used to run a yoga studio in the building. After Lionel died, she lost the lease. She's just bitter. Let's just give her a little space. She did just lose her fiancé. She'll come around. Uh, come around? Did you just hear her? Maybe she was the one that broke into our house and left that message. Who knows what else she's capable of. Thank you. You're her, aren't you? Excuse me? You still have that deer in headlights look about you. I'm sorry, who are you? I'm Theresa Diaz. The whole town has done nothing but talk about you all week. We don't get too many newcomers here in Blanca Bay. Never mind the newcomers who move into one of the hottest properties. Come, sit with me. Okay. So, has anyone tried to buy the house from you yet? I didn't realize it was so special. Oh! (chuckle) Justine has had her eyes on it for years. Of course, Lionel flat-out refused to discuss selling it, but I know she... Justine! How are you? Oh, my God, Theresa. (lips smacking) You look beautiful. Oh! - I love your suit. - Oh, thank you. It's Calvetti. (smug laugh) Hmm. I was just saying hi to your new neighbour. Yes, we met earlier today. I thought I saw your station wagon outside. Everyone is so excited to meet you and your family at the club later. What do you mean? What club? The country club, of course! There'll be a tour for new members this afternoon, and then, tomorrow, is the annual gala. Oh! It's always so much fun. You are coming, aren't you? I uh... Haven't you been invited? I'm afraid it's too short notice. You can't be serious. Surely you can get Molly and her family in. Oh no, I wouldn't wanna be a problem. Isn't your husband, Richard, on the board? Get him to pull a few strings. I suppose I could ask. It really is aimed for new members, though. Then Molly and her family are perfect! Really, I don't wanna be any trouble. Oh, nonsense! Everyone is going to be there. Now they will be. It's settled then. Thank you. It... sounds great. (light music) Hi there, I'm here for the new members tour. Molly Nolan. Thank you. (indistinct chatter) Do you remember the last time you wanted a new shop? You must be the famous Molly we've all been hearing about. Are you thinking of becoming a member? - Well... - If your husband golfs, he won't find anywhere better for a round in the country. We hadn't really thought about it until now. - Hmm. - So, how much did Lionel leave you with in the end? Yeah, I heard it was all tied up in stocks. Is that true? I suppose Justine's already made you an offer on the house. She's been dying to get her hands on it for years. I'll just go ahead and say it. I don't miss Lionel one bit. He was such a pain for all of us, on the chamber board. And I bet you're just a little happy that he's gone too, now that all this is yours. He was my dad. Of course! But... it's not like you knew him. Excuse me. Molly, hi! What a surprise! Come join me! What are you doing here? I mean, I just didn't think that this would be your crowd. Yeah, I wouldn't make it far in my business without a bit of schmoozing. I have been trying to get my foot in the door here for years. But I see it didn't take you long. I'm not sure this is really my kinda place. Yeah, they're all vultures, really, aren't they? I find the wine helps. Hmm. Besides, I just remind myself that it's all an act. Sure, they might pretend to be perfect, but everybody has their secrets. What do you mean? Well, okay, you see her? I guarantee you, she has a dozen of those mini liquor bottles in her purse. You know the kind you find on planes? She thinks no one realizes she's an alcoholic, but I don't know what else you call someone who has a vodka on the rocks for breakfast. (light music) And that couple there, they have slept in separate bedrooms for years. Don't even speak to each other unless they're in public. How do you know all this? Perks of the job. (chuckle) Being a realtor, I get to see what really goes on behind closed doors. And let me tell you, nobody lives a perfect life. Hmm. Oh, and surely someone's warned you about Justine. Warned me about what? Hmm, Justine and her husband, Richard, well, let's just say to keep an eye on them. They had a big falling out with Lionel. Something about the boundary between their land. I don't really know all the details, but I know Justine will always try to come out on top. (sigh) Wow. So, what are you wearing to the party tomorrow? I'm not sure. You don't have a dress? I mean, I have dresses. Oh, not a Blanca Bay Country Club gala worthy dress. What are you doing? Oh, lucky for you, I have a personal stylist. I'll see if I can get you an emergency appointment. Oh. Thank you. You have no idea. Okay, Justine is hosting tomorrow, and if everything is not perfect, well, it might just be enough to push her over the edge. (ominous music) (groan) (♪♪) (coughing) (coughing fit) (tense music) (knob clicking) (cough) (cough) Did you use the stove? Sorry, did I wake you up? You left the gas on. - No, I didn't. - It's lucky we didn't all choke in our sleep. It wasn't me. Maybe it was Grace. She left hours ago and Finn doesn't know how to cook. But I said it wasn't me. Wait, do you not believe me? All right, all I'm saying is to make sure you turn the gas off. Now you're not even listening. Well, can you please just be more careful next time? Fine. Whatever. (sigh) (♪) I thought I heard voices. Everything okay? Heather left the stove on in the kitchen. She could've killed us. It's not like her to be so careless. (sigh) What are you wearing? Something wrong with it? Wine is my colour, and everyone knows it. I'm sorry. I didn't know. This is also a formal event, not a cocktail party. Is my dress not long enough? There's a dress code. This isn't some neighbourhood barbecue like you're used to. This is the Blanca Bay Country Club. Have you never been to a gala? Well, no, actually. Well, let me remind you, there's a certain set of standards to uphold. We'll let it slide this time just because everyone's expecting you. Come on. I can't be stuck standing here chatting with you all day. (sigh) (light classical music) I don't know if I can do this. Don't let her get to you. Thank you. Here. Thanks. Let's go have some fun and mingle. (glasses clink) (chuckle) Come on. So, Heather, uh, have you skied in Europe? It's like another level and they're so laid-back about drinking there. I've never been skiing before. What? Why not? I mean, it's not like it's that's expensive of a hobby. Not once you have your own skis anyway. You just do it while you're on vacation. Yeah, our vacation's more like going up to the lake, so... Oh, my God. Were you poor or something? Like, actually poor?! (cackle) That's hilarious. No, Natasha, what's hilarious is that your dad couldn't be here today 'cause he's in... where is it, Cabo, with your cello teacher. Or is it your tennis coach? I'm sorry, I can't really keep up. I'm Paul. (♪) Whatever. (clear throat) Thanks for the rescue. Any chance to put Natasha in her place. (sigh) I wanna go home. Do you need a ride? No, I mean my real home, back in the city. I wish. I just miss my friends and my old life, so... I get it. I'm surprised to see you here. Didn't think you're one of them. (laugh) You didn't think I had money, you mean. Well, if you're rich, then why did you steal the candy from the coffee shop? Well, why not? It's fun, I guess. Speaking of... Here you go, sir. Here. Suit yourself. (chuckle) That must be Justine's husband, Richard. - Yeah. - Maybe I should go say hello. Make amends? Yeah, it's a good idea. - Hold my champagne. - Okay. (classical music) You must be Richard, Justine's husband. Thank you so much for getting us in today. I didn't get a chance to introduce myself before. Uh, no, I'm not... um... (Clear throat) My name's Warren. Mmhmm. Oh, I thought that was your husband. Well, you're mistaken. I saw you at the house with Justine when I stopped by. I didn't get a chance to say hello. No, you didn't. (guest): I knew she was having an affair. (reactions) Oh, my... Uh... I'm sorry. My mistake. (♪♪) Molly! Hello again. Hi. Theresa, right? Yes, yes. Look, don't worry about Justine. Everyone gets on the wrong side of her at some point. I really put my foot in it. In about five minutes, she'll have already found someone else to be angry with, and then, it'll blow over. I hope so. I wanted to talk to you, actually. I didn't mention this before, but I was Lionel Fitzpatrick's... lawyer. His lawyer? Why didn't you tell me anything? My husband must have spoken with you. To be honest, I didn't know what to make of you. Last time I spoke to Lionel, he was scared. He left me a message and he said, "She's dangerous and she only wants my money." Do you know who he could have meant? You know, I... I should've pressed more, but I didn't get a chance. And then he... Yeah. What are you doing here? (Justine): Darla, lower your voice. I will not! Darla, listen... No! You don't get to tell me what to do! It should all be mine, not yours! Lionel's house! His money! I was his fiancée. He loved me, not you! I'm sorry, I... You bring trouble everywhere you go. You will never be good enough for Blanca Bay. Never. (Theresa): Molly, wait! (insects chirping) Hey, you okay? Yeah. No. Just everything. This town is a lot. I need to talk to Theresa about Lionel some more. She said that he was scared of someone. Someone who was after his money. Do you think he meant Darla? Maybe. Who else could it be? (woman shrieking in background) What? (dramatic music) Oh, my God! She's dead! Excuse us. Excuse us. Theresa! (panicked breathing) - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God! (sobbing) (Heather): I can catch a ride back with one of the new girls I met. (Molly): I don't want you here any longer than you have to be. (ominous music) I can't believe it. I know, I... I had just talked to her. She said that she had something to tell me about Lionel, that he was scared of someone. Do you know who it could be? No, no, but like I said, I never really knew him. Theresa was trying to warn me and... now she's dead. I mean, what if it was Darla? What if she got to Theresa? Molly. They're saying that she might've just choked on something. She said she was gonna come find me. I just don't understand... Hey, no, it's terrible, but accidents happen. You can't dwell on it. (sigh) (crickets chirping) (light music) (Charlie): Are you okay? I can't stop thinking about Theresa. I shouldn't have left her. Molly, it was a terrible accident. There's nothing you could've done. What if it wasn't an accident? What if Theresa was trying to warn me about Darla? And maybe Darla wanted to shut her up. We don't know enough to make an accusation like that. You're right. So... this is what you do for fun? No... This is. But what if... what if someone calls the cops? The cops here do what we pay them to do. Don't let me drink alone. (nervous sigh) (chuckle) Hmm. Mm. Um, do you have a charger? Um... check the glove box. Oh, my God. (laugh) Look at your hair! Paul Weaver. Wait, are... are you related to Darla? (sigh) Uh, yeah. She is my mom. Why didn't you tell me? Because I thought you'd hate me if you found out. Well, how could you keep it a secret? 'Cause it's embarrassing. My mom, she's obsessed, and when she found out Lionel cut her out of the will, she... she kinda hit the roof. I mean, they were only together for a year and... he was a jerk to her. I would've done anything to stop them from getting married, so I... (sigh) I was happy when he died. Do you hate me for saying that? No. No, I get it. My mom acts like a psycho, so I... I didn't wanna scare you off because... (exhale) 'Cause I like you. I like you, too. (chuckle) (nervous giggles) Hey, babe. Whatcha looking for? Anything that might explain what happened. Or who Lionel was afraid of. There has to be something in here. He's gone, Molly. Sometimes, there's questions we don't get answers to. No. No, no, no. There's always answers, Charlie. Has to be here somewhere. Mom? (exhale) Wait... (sinister music) (Heather): Right here is perfect. I had a really good time tonight. Me too. Um, I'll see you later then. - Good night. - Night. (romantic music) Hey! Um... you forgot something. W... what? Night! (laugh) Yes! (light music) - Hi. - You look different. I went shopping. What do you think? I love it. How could anyone say no to you? So, I have a question for you. Just relax. The landlord is going to love you. I found an empty box in Lionel's things. It said "Sarah" on it. That was my mom's name. Sarah was your mother? Does that mean something to you? When Lionel first leased the building, he had plans for a restaurant. He was going to call it Sarah's. Rumour had it, she was his one true love. And then, Darla came on to the scene and scrapped the whole restaurant idea. Made him open her yoga studio instead. He was gonna name it after my mom? 'Til Darla wouldn't stand for it. Do you know what Darla and Lionel's relationship was like? You must have heard things. Oh, I heard the odd thing here and there. They fought a lot, apparently. Lionel must have found out that she was only after his money. - Showtime. - Hey, Rebecca. - Thanks for meeting us. - Hi. I didn't realize this was your building. Wait, you are the potential lessee? Yeah. But not. No way. - But... - No, I am not leasing anything to you. (exhale) I am so sorry. I didn't think. Is that it? Like, he won't even see my proposal because I embarrassed him? Molly, you humiliated him in front of the entire town. This is Blanca Bay. People hold grudges. (phone ringing) Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. Excuse me. Hey, honey. Hey, have you heard from Heather? School just called. She didn't show up for class. - What? Where could she be? - I don't know! Okay, you just stay put at the house in case she turns up. I'm already out, so I'll see if I can track her down. Okay? (tense music) I'm sorry, Rebecca. I've gotta go. Heather! Mom? Why aren't you in school? Take it easy. We're only missing algebra. I'm speaking with my daughter, thank you. Heather... It's not a big deal. Yes, it is. You can't just skip school. It's important. Important to you, maybe. I'm sorry, who are you? I'm Paul... Weaver. Darla's son? What are you doing with him? It's okay, Mom. Relax! Heather, we're leaving. Right now. Ugh! Heather? Heather! I can't believe that you're hanging out with him when you know who his mom is! You cannot trust him! You don't know the first thing about him! Oh, I know that family is bad news. I don't want you going anywhere near him again. You can't do that! Are you seeing him? No! Just tell me the truth. See, you never believe me. We're just friends. In fact, he's my only friend in this stupid town. Well, he is a bad influence. Since when did you start skipping school? Do you even care about your education anymore? Or college? Of course I do! But it's not a big deal. Everyone skips. Kids at my school do far worse and it's not a problem because their parents sort it out for them. That is not a way to go through life. You have to take accountability for your own actions. You just don't get it! I don't want you to see Paul again. Do you understand? (frustrated grunt) Heather. - Excuse me. - Not now, Grace. Thank you. Yes, Ma'am. (insects chirping) (ominous music) (door closing) Hello? Charlie! - What is it? - I think someone was trying to start a fire. Oh, my God. I'll call the police. (worrisome music) Somebody definitely broke in. Sir, there's so sign of forced entry. You're sure? What? How is that possible? (indistinct chatter) Thank you, officers. Hey, the police said there's no sign of forced entry. There has to be. Someone broke in. I don't know. Maybe we left the door unlocked? We didn't. I know that we didn't. Do you mind explaining why you're causing so much commotion? Calling the police over here at this hour? Someone was in our house. I'm just trying to protect our family. Then maybe you should care about what your daughter's doing. What? Heather? What does she have to do with this? Her and that Weaver boy hanging around all night. I wouldn't let a criminal like that near my family. Paul was here? Paul Weaver? You didn't know? (ominous music) (sigh) What's going on? Well, once I saw him creeping around in the middle of the night like some prowler, I felt like it was my duty to warn the others. How considerate. You know we never had any trouble like this in Blanca Bay until you arrived. (sharp exhale) Very classy, Justine. Heather, you lied to me? What happened to knocking? You told me you were with Natasha the other night, but you were sneaking around with Paul? After everything I've said? You don't even know him. You're making all these judgments and you don't know anything. I know enough, Heather. I know his mom is out to get us! Out to get us? Do you know how crazy that sounds? I don't want you to see him anymore. Understood? Get out. Get out of my room! I wish we never moved here! I wish we never moved here in the first place! I hate it here! (door slam) (sharp exhale) (sigh) Feels like everything is falling apart. Heather will come around. It's not just her. It's this place. There's so many questions about Lionel, about his life. No one could've known what was gonna happen. Yeah, well, Theresa was the only connection I had. If I could just ask her... (pensive music) What is it, Molly? Theresa was Lionel's lawyer. She must have all sorts of information on him, or a file. Yeah, but a file would be locked away somewhere. It must be in her office. I need to get in. Careful, Molly. I have to. We have so many questions and we need answers. I will not let anyone hurt our family. (heavy exhale) (sigh) (pensive music) - Good morning. - Hi. I'm early for my meeting with Mr. Hawthorne. Can you direct me to the restroom? Uh, of course. It's just down the hall and to the left. - Thank you. - Yeah. (suspenseful music) (♪♪) (quick breaths) Okay. (indistinct hallway chatter approaching) (hallway chatter fading) (sigh of relief) (gasp) (suspenseful music) Nothing. Oh, my God. I think I found the medical examiner's report on Lionel's death. But he said he had a heart attack. What? (gasp) What is it? It says that possible foul play may have been suspected. Foul play? So, someone deliberately wanted to hurt him. But how? Okay, look here. It says that... that Lionel was on medication for his heart, but when the police searched the property after he died, they couldn't find the pills anywhere, except for a single pill that was in the kitchen sink. As if someone just poured them out. Yeah. He was murdered. But who'd wanna hurt him? And why didn't the police investigate? I just don't understand. Something like this, it doesn't just get brushed under the carpet. It was murder! Right. Someone has to know what happened, or why the police let it go. (ominous music) And I think I know who may know. Who? Who knows all the secrets of Blanca Bay? (Rebecca): Hi. Thank you. Molly, hi! How can I help? You're not looking to sell already, are you? Because if you are, I know a fantastic listing agent. No. But there is something that I wanna talk to you about, if you'd like to take a seat. Sure. It's about Lionel. I found the medical examiner's report and the police say that they suspect someone might have played a part in his death. What? Where did you get that? Oh, it doesn't matter. But if they think he had been killed, why didn't they investigate? The police in this town don't like to ruffle any feathers. But I'm sure questions were asked. Of course. They looked into Darla, but she had an alibi. Really? She was with her son, Paul, apparently. Thanks, Grace. But that doesn't make any sense. Someone poured Lionel's pills down the drain. She had to have been here. Thank you. Wait, unless... what if Paul lied to help his mom? (ominous music) Or maybe they planned it together, thinking they'd get their hands on Lionel's fortune when he died, and they didn't know that he had cut them from his will. Huh, that's a very serious accusation, Molly. Well, it's possible, though, isn't it? I suppose. Who knows how far someone would go to get their hands on a fortune like Lionel's. (soft chuckle) (door slam) Hey, honey, how was... (sigh) (knocking on door) How was school? Did you take that math test? I'm talking to you, Heather. No, you're snooping. You wanna know if I saw Paul. I'm just trying to keep you safe. Don't you trust me? It's not about trust. (sentimental music) I know I... I haven't told you about my mom, have I? I mean, there's not a lot to say, really. She... she died when I was little and I don't really remember her. But I wish I did. You know, I used to... imagine what she would be like. Like, what she might've said to me in a certain situation. You know, like, if I was having a bad day at school or... if I was upset. I used to imagine what the... perfect mom would do in that moment. (deep exhale) And as I grew up, I... I just thought about what it would be like to have a family of my own. You know, I always dreamed of it. And I was determined that if I had a family, that I would... I would be there for them, and I would try to be the best mom that I could be. And I would do it all for my mom because she didn't get that chance. Everything that I do is for my family. Always. And I'm sorry if I upset you. I... But I will never let anything or anyone hurt you. Okay? (indistinct) I'm gonna make some tea. (Charlie): Okay. Can I have some, too? (chuckle) Of course. (Charlie): Thank you! (crickets chirping) (cat meowing in distance) (menacing music) Hello? Grace? (meow) (clattering) (insects chirping) (♪♪) (sigh) Thank you, my love. (ominous music) No, no, no, no, no! Charlie, stop! Ooh! - What the hell? - Oh, my God. I think it was poisoned. What? There's detergent in the trash can and it wasn't there a minute ago. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! I'm calling the cops. Thank you, officer. Appreciate you taking the time. (sigh) Let me guess. No sign anyone was in here. Well, he took a sample of the water, but who knows how long that's gonna take to test. Someone was in here. Someone tried to hurt me. Why does no one believe me? I know. I believe you. Come here. (soft music) (birds tweeting) Excuse me, what is all this? It's street art. You wanna draw, too? Clean it up, immediately. It's just some fun. It'll wash off in the rain. It is disgusting graffiti. Clean it up now or I will be forced to call the HOA. (footsteps receding) (sharp exhale) What's your problem? - Excuse me? - You heard me. Ever since we've moved here, you've been rude and condescending to me and my family. How dare you suggest. Do you think that we're not good enough to live here? You think that just because we come from a different background that we don't belong? You don't belong here. You're right. The whole lot of you. Blanca Bay is... well, it's a question of class. You wanna speak about class? Well, you know what? You are not a nice person. Excuse me? (scoff) You judged us before even getting to know us. You didn't even give us a chance. And you did the same thing to Lionel. What on earth are you talking about? I've heard all about the argument you had with him. You and your husband, some dispute over your land. And you wanted the house, didn't you? Who told you that? Doesn't matter where I heard it. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me. What? I don't know who told you that Lionel and I had a disagreement, but that's not true. I actually liked Lionel. We got along fine. But you are so ungrateful! Ungrateful? I have no idea what you're talking about. You should be thanking me. What? I'm the one who encouraged Lionel to meet you. Wait... what... (sigh) Your mother was Sarah, wasn't she? Yeah. Lionel would talk about her occasionally. Of course, never while Darla was around, but every now and then, he would mention her. The great love of his life that got away. By the time he went looking for her, she was already dead. But he heard that she had a kid who was adopted. I'm the one who encouraged him to find you and reach out. And he was so excited to meet you after all these years. But you were only after one thing. "She's only after my money." That's what he said to me. He was heartbroken. But I never met him. Well, you got exactly what you wanted, didn't you? (melancholic music) Hey, what's going on? I'm just so confused. Justine said that she encouraged Lionel to meet me, and I never did. I never heard from him. Did he try and get in contact? Maybe. And what if he found me and he didn't like what he saw? I've been looking through his desk hoping for... I don't know, hoping to find a letter, something, anything to help me understand. Okay, okay, let... let me help. All right? I've already looked through all the drawers. Oh, God. I don't even know where else to look. Wait a minute. (clunk) Charlie! Lionel had a gun? If he told Theresa he was scared, makes sense. I don't want a gun in the house with the kids. Someone's messing with us. It wouldn't hurt to have protection. Charlie, it worries me. Okay, okay. No, you're right. I'll take it to the police station tomorrow. Until then, we'll leave it in there. Hey... what's this? It's from St. Luke's Adoption Agency. It's about a baby girl. But weren't you adopted from the Tulip House Agency? Yeah. Did they change their name? I don't think so. Wait... what if there's been some sort of mix up? What do you mean? What if the lawyers or the adoption agency got it wrong? What if I was never Lionel's daughter? But what about the box we found with your mom's name? Maybe they were together. At least for a while. What if he was never my father and... and all of this... what if all of this belongs to someone else? (pensive music) (heavy sigh) (sigh) Hello, Tulip House Adoption Agency. This is Bill Porter. Hi, Bill, this is Molly. Molly Nolan. You came to my house to discuss my father. His name was Lionel Fitzpatrick. Of course, Molly. How can I help? Well, some new information has come to light about Lionel and I... I just wanna make sure that he was my father. Like, if there's any way that there could've been a mix-up. I'm afraid that's not possible. His lawyer ran some pretty extensive checks on you. They didn't want all that money going to the wrong person. No, exactly. But is there any way? Absolutely not. It may not be what you wanna hear, but Lionel Fitzpatrick was your father. Okay, thanks. It's real. Lionel was my dad. So, what was the letter about? It said that a baby girl was adopted through the St. Luke's agency. It wasn't me. But what if Lionel had another daughter? Well, then, that would mean... you would have a... A sister. (soft music) (crickets chirping) Oh, my God! (menacing music) Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! - What? - Someone's been in the house. - What?! - Where are the kids? - I just put Finn to bed. - The living room is destroyed! Did you not hear anything? No! We were playing video games! Oh. Where's Heather? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! (tense music) Where is she? Paul. She's with Paul. Oh, my God! - Where is she? - I don't know! Her location is somewhere across town. Stay here with Finn. I'll go get her. Heather?! What are you doing here? Heather, are you here, honey? What do you think you're doing? I'm getting my daughter. Why on earth would she be here? Her and Paul. Wait, you didn't know? No, I don't. I don't believe you. I don't care if you believe me or not. (Heather): Mom? What are you doing here? What's going on? Come here. I want the two of you off of my property or I'm calling the police. That's rich coming from you. I know that you've been trying to run us out of town, sneaking into our house, wrecking the place. That is ridiculous. All because Lionel left everything to me. You can't stand it. He was my fiancé. Of course, I can't. But to think that I would be breaking into your house? I'm not crazy. Besides, how would I even get in? You must have a key from when Lionel was alive. No, Rebecca made very sure to take back my keys, and she enjoyed it, too. Rebecca took your keys? Exactly. So, tell me, how on earth would I be sneaking into your house? (sigh) (doorbell chimes) Hey, Rebecca. Um, I'm sorry, now's not a good time. Oh no. Is there something I can help with? (alarming music) Um... Heather, we have to go, now! - Paul! - I don't understand what's going on. Heather, please, just get in the car. Here you go. (phone ringing) Thanks. Yeah. Oh. Molly, hey! Did you find Heather? Heather's okay. I've got her here with me. But listen, it's Rebecca. She's behind everything! What? It was never Darla! It's Rebecca! (thud) Charlie? Get away! - What's happening? - We have to go! (engine roaring) (tense music) Heather, come on! (panting) (whispering): Heather, go get your brother. But Mom... Go! Charlie? Charlie? Charlie? Charlie? (ominous music) Charlie?! Oh, Charlie! Honey! (shaky breathing) Rebecca. It's Rebecca. Oh, no, I know. I know. Are you okay? Yeah. The kids. Get the... get the kids. The kids. Get the kids! (laboured exhale) Heather? Mom? Mom? Shh! We're okay. We're okay. Where's Dad? He's gonna be all right. But right now, I need you to take care of Finn. I don't know if I can. You are braver than you know. I need your help right now, okay? When I say the coast is clear, I need you and Finn to go to a neighbour's and call 911. You can... you can do it. I know you can. (thunder rumbling) (creaking overhead) (gasp) But Mom, I'm scared! It's okay. I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you. Your sister's got you right now. I love you both. So much. (ominous music) (floorboards creaking) (thudding blow) Ah! Ah! Kids! Run! - Mom? - Go! Let's go! (tense music) Ah! (bat clattering) (heavy breathing) (thunder rumbling) Molly! Molly! I just wanna talk! (rapid knocks on door) (rain pattering) (floor creaking) (sigh of relief) (scream) (fighting grunts) You ruined everything! (groan) (pained breathing) (hurried breathing) (♪) (gun cocks) Don't even think about it. Just put the gun down. And we can talk about it. Please, Rebecca. It's too late. (thunder cracking) You know Lionel looked at me just like that, too. Right at the end. You killed him? But why? Why do you keep defending him? After everything he did. He abandoned you! He abandoned us! The letter from St. Luke's Adoption Agency. The baby girl. It was you. He was your father, too. He was the reason I moved to this stupid town in the first place! I came looking for family. But he decided all I cared about was his money. As if that's so bad! I struggled my whole life and he had all of this. But no... he didn't want anything to do with me. All I ever wanted was a family and he wouldn't even talk to me! So, you killed him. (panicked breathing) (gasp) What have you done? (ominous music) (Molly): You did all of this. Oh, you too. This dress is amazing. Good to see you! - Are you enjoying yourself this evening? - Oh, it's a beautiful event. Oh, wonderful. I just wanted to say hi. Oh, I need to go say hi to that man over there. (eerie choral music) (deep inhale) (insects chirping) Hello? Grace? (somber music) (indistinct chatter in distance) But he left everything to you. I didn't ask for any of this. Why did he choose you over me? What's so wrong with me?! (grunt) (thudding blow) Ugh... Mom! Don't move. (tense music) (indistinct police radio chatter) We're gonna be all right. Yeah. (police sirens wailing in distance)
