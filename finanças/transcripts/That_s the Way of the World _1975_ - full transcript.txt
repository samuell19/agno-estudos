- Where the hell is he Buckmaster? - I'll run him down and get him up here. - Yeah yeah why don't you do that? Oh Warren you didn't meet Mike Lemongello did you? - Hey Mike how are you? Good to see. - Hello Warren, pleasure. - Oh yeah man that's bad. - Okay hold on just a minute. Hey Buck it's for you baby. - We're working. - Hello we're busy right now, can it wait? Okay okay right now. It's the man baby. He wants you upstairs like yesterday. - James? - Right. - Oh man you ain't got time for no meeting. We got work to do. - I know what I got to do. You guys get on the next cut and I'll get back to you. - Oh man we ready. - We ready to get it on. - Well you can get it together and get it later then you got it so well together now. - Come on Johnny. - Hey Buckmaster come on in. I want you to meet the manager of The Pages, Mike Lemongello. - How do you do? - A real pleasure. - Sit down Johnny. - I heard a lot about you. I can't wait to see what you'll do with The Pages. Everybody tells me what a real heavyweight you are. - What are The Pages? - What are The Pages? Come on The Pages gonna make this company a ton of money, that's what The Pages are. - Oh well that's cool. You want me to set up an audition? - No no no no, it isn't necessary. - Are they playing in town? I'll try to run down and catch the show. - We're way ahead of you on this way Buck. We got a demo of them cut live. You're gonna love them, put it on. Sit down, sit down. Wait till you hear this, you'll love it. They're gonna be a monster, a monster. Orlando to New York now boarding, gate 12. - Good morning. We're The Pages I believe you have some tickets for us. - Pages, Pages, Pages yes. Are all five of you Pages here now? - Wait a minute there are only three of us. That's odd, A Chord Records prepaid five first class tickets for you folks. - Well, two are for the musical instruments. When your stars man, even the guitars go first class. - Isn't he something? - Okay okay, Buck why don't you kick us off? - Well the vocal is thin but it is linear. There's certainly no musical pretensions. Can you dig that Johnny? - I might say the arrangements don't get in the way. - Ellen what do you think? - I think it's dynamite. That girl has really got a sound. - It's a sound, but it's not our sound. - Player? - Very exciting. Look Buck I'm down on those streets every day. People on the street are tired of junkies pushing revolution, all that's over with man. - No question about it. The minute I heard them I knew they were the 70's. We're all going back folks to apple pie, and coffee, and home cooking. And I'm gonna tell you every act like this has been a chart buster and everybody's pushing one. Capital's got a family act. Columbia's what, got three of them. All making money hand over fist. - Now wait a minute this is the first time I ever heard these people. You're not telling me we've signed? - Signed them for peanuts. I picked them up from a little label down in Florida. And I got them at their original terms. - The deal of the century. - You're telling me. And I'm telling you when The Pages make money we all make money so it's a good time folks. Start calling those markers in. Let the people know we really believe in this one. - I believe. - That a boy player. You with us Johnny? - Yeah I'll be into it. - Ellen, get the bios right out. I want all the trades to know we're going out gold on this single. Now I know you all got a lot of work to do. Nobody else knows how to do it anybody better. Need anything special, let Warren know okay. You got it, doing a good job Warren. Let's move it, good job. Anything you want boss, you got it. - Appreciate it. - Who's in that cart? - That's your nephew Mr. Lemongello. - Right on time. Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt your game like this. - Tell me about The Pages. - The Pages well they're going to arrive what in just a couple of hours really. And I've got the company all psyched up. They're gonna make their quota at all cost. - I'm not so sure Buckmaster is as psyched up as he should be. - What? - And he's a key guy here. - I can handle Buckmaster believe me Mr. Ferrara. They said he was very important to the record reviewers. - What was was, what will be we'll see. - You won't be disappointed Mr. Ferrara believe me. - I hate to be disappointed once. And I'm never disappointed twice. - I understand sir. - What about the jukebox situation? - That's my business. And I want you to let James take care of the record company. That's his business. - Buckmaster I tell you what, tonight The Pages are having a little cocktail party up at their hotel suite. Kind of like to have you run by there, develop a little rapport with them. So you don't go in the studio cold with them tomorrow. - Tomorrow I'm all booked with The Group. - So be unbooked. Let me tell you something while I got you in here. I'm getting fed up with all this artistic bull stuff you been pulling off around here. It's about time you started earning that fancy salary of yours. Now you'll be in the studio tomorrow recording The Pages. And I'll make that record number one with a bullet. - It was always my understanding that the only charts you understood were cash flow projections and computers. I didn't know you had any creative expertise. - Look I became president of this company because I have expertise in every phase of its operation. - There's one thing I learned from the last president of this company, Norman Shulman, who incidentally owned the company himself. And that is that you can't make chicken salad out of chickens music. - Don't pull it Norman Shulman stuff on me will you? He's gone, I'm running this label now. - Well don't pull your artistic bull with me. - Listen will you please. You don't understand you're in the big leagues now. Come on this isn't some lots and cheesecake operation. You're working with a corporate division. When we get behind something, things happen. - That act's not worth the vinyl. - What is it, maybe I'm talking a foreign language. I gotta answer the Board of Directors. And you, you answer to me. Now I'm gonna give you the ball. You're gonna run with it and you're gonna put points on the scoreboard. - This isn't a damn football game, this is music. - Alright music, it's still competition win or lose. You don't believe me look out there. There's a million people out there right now all across America, and they're waiting for what? For somebody to tell them what's right for them. I mean wait a minute listen to me. I made that decision, I get paid for that. I know what's right for them, The Pages. Why, 'cause they're clean, they're decent, they got joy in their heart. They got hope in their voice for all America. Listen to what I'm saying. - Stop kidding yourself. I know what sells, that's what I'm paid for. People aren't as dumb as you want to think they are. They want something that's real, something of value. And you have it downstairs, The Group. We can be proud of that product and still make 20 million dollars. - Listen The Group is a walking pig stye, look at them. They're a bunch of freaks, don't you understand? And while you're recording them some sharpshooter in the industry, he's out trying to pick me off. I'm gonna tell you something, he's not gonna do it pal. No way, you understand? I'll tell you what we need now. We need profits and that's all this quarter. We don't get the profits, no recordings, no releases. Your friends in The Group they're out. We'll cut the staff down. You know Johnny? Johnny's gone. I'm not asking you for advice. I'm telling you you take The Group you put them on the back burner. You leave him there till I tell you otherwise. - Well it's obvious you are going into dumb music. But what makes you think I'm gonna help you? - That's simple, you got no options that's why. You got no options you see. You'll be in the studio tomorrow, you'll record The Pages with enthusiasm or else you're not going into a record company again with The Group, with anyone. Don't cut your own throat. - You couldn't run this company without me. You think you can take The Pages into a studio, make a commercial record out of that go ahead. No I know I can't do that. You walked out on me I'm in trouble. I don't know what I do. I know what you'll do, you'll do nothing, natta. You'll be out there saving the rocks that's what you'll do. I'll pull that no competition clause in your contract so fast it'd make your head spin. For four years you won't be doing anything in any recording company. You'll be able to push a broom around a damn record store. You're uptight alright, so am I. Maybe that's good, it's a sensitivity session. Think it helps clear the air. You understand, come on come on let's go, come on. - So long. Grossman's office called again. - Tell them I'm out of town. Thank God. - Call Early down to studio. Tell him I want to see him right away. - What's the matter, got problems? - Nothing I can't handle. He may be the man with the golden ear, but I got a ring in it with a chain four years long. - Let's go down and make some records. - We're gonna have to cool it for a bit. I have to record a new group. Now I'm gonna try and finish them as fast as I can and get back with you in a couple of days. - Got to record a new group? Man we've been waiting seven months. Those cat's are waiting on me downstairs. - Yeah I know man it blows my mind too but that's the way it's gonna have to be just for a little while. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. - Ah bull. - Now come on man who you talking to? - And seven months we been rehearsing, getting it together, now here we are. - I mean ever since I met you and The Group man I been helping you with your act, with your sound, with your style, with everything. - Man I got cats downstairs waiting who believe in me, believe in you. - Well just get your head into that Mel Cooper gig for a couple of days man. It was hard enough to get you and the guys on TV. I'll take care of everything else. - I just don't know one thing, one thing Bucky. Are we gonna finish the album or not? - Man we're gonna finish that album. That album's as important to me as it is to you. - Wow, look man I'm gonna trust you. We friends right? - Right. - Man to man right? Okay solid. - Alright. - Me and you. You take care, later. - Mr. Buckmaster I'm Lee Gallagher, I called you. - I told you I don't listen to unsolicited material. - Yeah but I hitchhiked all the way from Carbondale. - I didn't ask you to come. - But I'm here, can't you give me just five minutes? - Get yourself a manager. - What's five minutes? If you don't like it I'll never bother you again. - Please? - Listen it's my life. I'm not gonna leave you alone until you listen to me. - Now you listen to me. You've got two chances in this business, slim and none. And that's only if somebody gets behind you and pushes, and pulls, and turns you every way but loose. There's 100 burnt out cases for every one that gets to be a third rate road band. Now you go home to Carbondale and get yourself a job and a woman. 'Cause if I ever see you around here again I'm gonna have you busted for vagrancy. - What did you do to the gent Mr. Buckmaster? He staggered out of here like a zombie. - You ever see him around here again buddy, you make sure he gets up to my office alright? Okay have a good day. - Here he is everybody, the man I've been talking about, Buckmaster. - Well hi there. I'm Franklyn Page. - Dow do you do? - Mighty pleased to meet you Buckmaster. You know I reckon this is gonna be a real opportunity working with you. - I reckon it will. To The Pages. And the sound of the 70's. - Oh that's good. - It's just like a dream come true being here. - Hi I'm Gary. Is your name Buckmaster or? - Call me Buckmaster. - Hi. - Hi. - His father was the famous jazz pianist Harry Buckmaster. - Far out. - Waiter, get my friend a drink will you. - Why sure sure that was a real famous name in music. You know I'd be mighty proud to see the name Page up there. - Can you sit down? - You know we almost missed our flight? We just felt he couldn't leave without visiting our mom. - Should have brought her along, on us. - She's gone, just five years ago today. - Velour. - See Daddy here doesn't like for me to talk about her because I guess he's afraid people we'll think we're corny. You don't think there's anything wrong with honest feelings do you Mr. Buckmaster? - Not when they sell records honey. - Hey does anybody have anything to smoke? - Oh I got some-- - Cool it for now sweetheart please. Here. - Hey that's some bad torch. - Like it Gary, here be my guest. Use it in good health. - Hey far out. Thanks Mike. Next time why don't you take it right out of my mouth. - I'm so excited, I can't believe we're actually going into a studio with you tomorrow. - That's the schedule. - You just can't believe how much I'm really looking forward to working with you. - Should be an experience. - Hey Franklyn. - How are you? - Alright, listen I have somebody here I want you to meet especially. His name is Al Rapp, Editor of Chart Magazine. - Mr. Rapp, we just love your magazine. We get it in Orlando and it just makes us feel a part of the whole industry. - No no no it Al sweety. And make sure you get next week's issue because we're running a full page ad on you folks. Where did James ever find her? - Well we were playing Disney World in Orlando. - What were you doing honey? - That's really cute you saying that. Because I just loved your records when I was in Junior High School. - Thank you. Cheers. - Hey hold it, that's just how I got it. - You need to get Johnny to write something special for me. - But Johnny's under contract to A Chord. You know he can't do that. Are you coming to A Chord? - Don't look so thrilled. Warren says if I'm nice to Rapp he'll talk to James for me. And who knows maybe I'll end up in a studio with you one day. I could surprise you you know. - A studio? - Come on Al. Did I ever tell you I just love your way with numbers? - It is not so easy to get a pick of the week these days Bucky but I think we just got one with The Pages. - You make promises Warren and I'm supposed to keep them. Don't count on it. - We're all in the same boat Bucky. - Mom played the piano. She taught Gary and me to believe in God's music. - Velour I don't think that Ellen is rely interested in-- - Oh I am, it's fascinating, it's dynamite copy. - Well it's gonna be a big page in your memory book hey Buck? - Don't you get to feeling too good yet. I'll catch you later. Excuse me, I'm gonna have to leave now. You folks might want to get to sleep early for tomorrow Hey that's a good idea. Goodnight. Good night Buck I'll see you. - Sleep's like practicing for death when there's so much to do. - Good night, nice meeting you both. - Goodnight. - Easy Buck. - Don't get too burned up kid. - It's five degrees, the weather man says it's gonna be that way again tonight. You know what we're gonna do, we're gonna hang out. It's Frankie Crocker in New York. We've got good music for you. Of course speaking of good music last night I had the opportunity to see a brand new group. It's like they call themselves The Group. And they have a dynamite sound. Make your knees freeze and your liver quiver baby. And I tell you what I got a little surprise for you. They gave me a tape last night. Took it home, listened to it and I thought it was good enough for you. In fact I dig him and one other note too on that. Tomorrow night they're gonna be opening live the first time in New York at the Rolling Dome. Check out bad sounds of The Group. - Come in. - Here. - Thanks. Does James know about this? - James knows about everything. Look Buck, everybody around here appreciates what you're doing for this place. But James is the boss and we gotta do it his way or the ball game's over. You know it's not that bad at all. I mean it's a two billion dollar a year industry because of button down types like James. Yeah but first you have to have the music to sell. - They don't believe that. They believe that money and muscle can sell anything. - Hey listen man don't blow your gig, I mean. - That's what I'm trying to tell you Buck. - How are you Buck? - What's the matter? Hi Dad, I've got some stuff to drop off. - Hey, how are you champ? I can't come to the house tonight. - Okay. Oh pay dirt. Hey, a good boy taking care of his old mans nose. - Dad can I talk to you privately for a second? - Come in to my office. - Listen dad you're gonna have to make that blow stretch a little. I don't know when I can do it for you again. - What you got trouble with the law? - No no it's just, it seems like everyone's into my business downtown. I just have to clean things up a little. James is trying to play Mr. Music and that could get to be a nightmare. - He's the boss, he's running the company ain't he? - The only notes he ever heard of are promissory. Now he's trying to tell me what kind of music the people want to hear. - All I know is you're making some pretty heavy dough. - Oh come on man you know I'm in here just for the money. You know that if I can't make my kind of music I might as well be selling shingles. - Look all that hard stuff, it doesn't always put the food on the table. - It was never more important than your freedom. If I lose my freedom I lose my reputation and I lose everything. - All I'm saying is just don't do anything stupid. Why don't you talk to Shulman? - Yeah maybe I will do that. Alright dad I got a split I'll catch you later. - Hey champ. Don't do anything stupid. - Okay let's take it from the top again one more time please. - The arrangements ain't making it. We're gonna try to salvage it, let's try a new approach. Let's overdub a new piano track. Okay cut. Okay let's run it down. No no, no no that's not working. Let's change the rule Johnny. Hold it, hold it. Instead of repeating the G minor seven let's change it to a B flat major seven. Alright that's good. Okay let's run it again from the top. - Gary, Franklin would you step closer to your mics? We need a fatter sound on a voice. Okay that's fine. Velour, when you hold those long notes would you start your vibrato a little sooner? And listen honey if you stood closer to the mics we get a nice breathy sexy sound alright, thank you. Ready when you are. - Okay let's take five. We're gonna listen to some playback. Pages if you like, you can come into the control room. Okay Joe let's hear it again would you please? - Okay Joe that's cool. - Well should we go back out and try it again? - Yes let's do that. - Let's go. - Let's check out the piano changes. - Okay right, hey that was super bad what you did it man bringing the voice up like that to match the other guys, super bad really. - I think she can sell the act. - Hey right on. Did you ever try to learn Japanese? After I have a couple of drinks of sake I can speak Japanese. You think I could learn Japanese too by drinking? Keep drinking the sake you'll find out. - I don't understand why if The Group is so much better than The Pages they want to promote The Pages. - Family acts are big this month. The radio stations, the record shops, the casinos are all a bunch of sheep. Thank you. If an act breaks in with a new image of big sales they all scramble around to get one just like it. They all try to cash in on the fad. Yeah I remember all those lousy British bands trying to sound like the Beatles. - That's right. Most of the people who run record companies, they aren't about to provide any kind of musical leadership for the public. They just want to put their hands into their pockets. You know give me, give me. - What happens after The Pages? - Never mind that, what happens tonight? They're just gonna keep cranking out the same kind of garbage. Right now the idea is to have me produce fast Buck bubble gum. Then when they think the drug supplies are loosening up they're gonna tell me to produce some music for kids to freak out by. - You mean like instant social remedies from the same wonderful people who gave us decadence? - I kinda like that, that's right. - Why don't you do something else in your life? Just get away from those people. the music business is a jungle. - Well music is my life, it's important to me. It's important to people and then if it's good it can give people some hope and it can make them feel good even if it is only for a couple of minutes. And that's what I want to do. And I'm going to do it. - How long before you're finished? I got the presses waiting on overtime. - As long as it takes. Do you want it good or do you want it now? - Mike see if the need anything in there will you? Planning any breaks? I need them for wardrobe. - We're on a break, take them to wardrobe. Pages it really sounds great in there. I'd like to have you a few minutes for a wardrobe fitting in the conference if I can please. Maybe you ought to come along too and kinda get sense of what they're gonna look like. - I've got enough problems just worrying about what they're going to sound like. - Franklyn. Yeah I want to show you what we got for you. Wait till you see this wardrobe. - It's really fantastic the way that you keep, you build and improve on our sound. - Are we working you too hard? - No no it's really been too exciting. You are something to watch in a studio. - You seem to catch on pretty quick, like an old pro. - Do you really think so? - I think we made a lot of progress today. - Yeah the song it's building, and now it's really fresh and clean. I can't believe that you make me sound so good. - Wait till you hear the finish track. This is just the beginning. - You really know where all the magic buttons are don't you? Are we gonna be able to get the same sound on the television show? - Which television show? - The one we're being dressed for. In eight days we're gonna be on the Mel Cooper show. We really better go because Mr. James is gonna think we ran off. - Yeah. Joe wrap it now would you? - You like that? I thinks it's dynamite. - This is our conference room. We use it for wardrobe right now. Sorry to bust up the session but I got some clothes I want you to try on. Franklyn I got a white outfit that you'll love. And you Gary, I want you to try on this little flowered shirt. It might be a little too much, take a look at it. Let's see the artwork. This is nice, this is sweet yeah I like this. - The main thing is really, is it me, is it really me? - No this no, cover up a little bit more here. I don't want too much to show. What do we got a little joy lace or something going on? Come on, give me that. Rebecca of Sunnybrooke Farm. Don't cut off the head so much. I'll give you a little more head room. Here she is, Velour. Hey honey what sound down there, beautiful. I'm sorry to break up your session. - No that's okay. - I want you to try on this costume. Put the gingham on her alright. You'll love it. Okay let's finish up here and get it out. This is beautiful. Hey Buck look at the artwork on this, beautiful. We took it at the airport when The Pages arrived. - That picture in a little tinted tone, maybe a sepia. Kind of give you a subliminal hint of a clean, less complicated period of time. Yes and with that jet in the background you've got impact, sex, The Pages are here. - I wish I'd seen this earlier. I could lead in of jet noise, just bury the whole damn arrangement. - Oh come on. - You know how to tell the difference between boy chromosomes and girl chromosomes? You pull down their genes. - Alright alright we had our laugh let's get good. - What about this TV show? How did you get The Pages on? I know Cooper wouldn't break two of our acts. - No he wouldn't. - You got him to bump The Group for them? - Yeah that's right. - It took me months to get them on that show. - Yeah and it took me minutes to get them off. You know maybe it's time you took some lessons in exploitation. Hey Velour, that's great, oh it's wonderful. Buck what do you think? - You look very nice. - Thank you. - It's super. We'll get it pinned up. I want you to wear that on the Mel Cooper show. Hey Riley pin her up will you? Believe me baby it's in character, Miss America. - Good good okay. See you back in the studio. - You tell Early yet? - Yeah yeah I told him. - What did he say? - What difference does it make? He's of age, about time he knew the facts of life. - We're going to lose The Group. - Maybe you're gonna lose them. A Chord's got them signed in a contract for five years, they're not going anyplace. And neither is A Chord, not if you don't open your eyes. - Hey listen Buck come on now. You're really a slow learner you know that? You been in the business now what, eight to 10 years? You still think music is some kind of a little pretty toy balloon you blow up and you just toss in the air. Let me tell you pal it's product. You gotta sell it like any other product. When the market is prime you strike. And if it's not prime you create a market for it. You make people believe if they don't buy it they're not gonna be with it, they're not gonna be hip, they're not gonna get laid, not gonna get a job, they're gonna end up at the back of the pack. Maybe that's good. That's the way of the world my friend. - I don't believe that. - Yeah I know. Just tell me what you're gonna do. Are you gonna bite the bullet, you gonna stay here on your job? You gonna make the grand stand exit and regret it the rest of your life? - Don't worry, I won't do anything stupid. - Okay. Norman, it's Buck. I'm in here. - What does that mean? - It's Russian, it means don't sell the bear skin until first you kill the bear. Spassky is a Russian. He doesn't understand that I'm a Russian too. I understand all of his devious schemes. - Norman this is quite a setup you've got here. And you're looking very good. - You noticed? What's on your mind? Well it's good to see you. - It's always good to see you too. - I've got some trouble down at the company and I need your help. It concerns The Group. - They got a lot of potential. I think they're gonna give you a monster one of these days. - Norman I've got them to where they're ready to pop. - What the hell can your problem be? - James, he's giving me a lot of service. He wants me to shelve The Group. He's brought in some family act without ever consulting me. And he wants me to produce their single. - Do it fast and get it over with. And then get back to The Group. My reputation is on the line. - Bucky you've got a big reputation in the music business. Who the hell is gonna remember one bad record? - That's not a question of one bad record. This is their new policy. - Okay cut to the chase. What do you want me to do? - Whatever you can. It was your company Norman, you know those people. You can go to the Board of Directors. I'm no longer in a position to do anything like that. - Oh come on Norman. - The organization runs the company. The organization runs ATC. - What, what organization, what are you telling me? - Oh you can't be that naive. You grew up in Brooklyn, you gotta know something about the organization. I don't know what the hell they called it then but that's who runs the company. - What, what are you telling me? When did this all happen? - You know Bucky you isolated yourself in the creative end of our business, and that's good, that's cool. The only way you can hype a record is with payola, layola, flyola, now they even go for drugola. Where do you get the cash? You can't Mickey the books, the government won't let you do it. You make a deal with the organization. They own lots of jukeboxes and they need thousands and thousands of records, and they got a lot of cash to circulate. - That's what you did Norman. We we had a successful company, a respected label. - They wanted to buy the company. They gave me enough, I'm happy. I can play chess with Spassky. I don't have to worry anymore about breaking backs and selling wacks. That's the way of the world. - That's the way of the world? So you mean the organization is responsible for putting James there? - That's right Bucky. Yeah why don't you smarten up? Don't live in an ivory tower. I told you many times to succeed creatively you must first succeed financially. So long Buck. - So long Norman. - Mike thank you very much. You know I really enjoyed that Chili's restaurant. - You would. - Thank you Frank, I'm glad you did. I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it Velour. - Mr. Lemongello you're 100% chump. - Vel, will you cut it out? - I'm so sorry Mr. Lemongello, you're a 10% chump. You are the 100% chump. Here. I was looking for the lost chord, you got it? - I don't work nights. - Who is talking about work? Don't be mad. You know I just got off the gray line tour of every dull site in every town. Come on, why don't you take us out? We got James's car. And James and Lemongello will pay for everything. - Well thank you for the offer but I intended to spend the evening home. - Oh well I'll just keep you company. - That's not exactly what I had in mind. Alright I'll tell you what? I'll take you up on that offer. - Okay you get in the jump seat so Buck can sit back here next to me. You know where the Rock and Roll Dome is? - Sure. Have a good time, goodnight. Thanks Frank. Hey baby you're looking fantastic. - Hey thanks a lot. You know that group is dynamite. They are turning this place out, they're fantastic. - I talked to Frankie Crocker, her really dug your tapes. - Oh are they gonna put anybody now? - Didn't say, I'm taking a lunch with him next week. Maybe you can read live. - Oh that's fantastic, hey thanks a lot. - It's alright. - Who are your friends? - A new act we're bringing this week. - There goes your act. - Don't grab me like that again. - Are yu out of your mind? We didn't bring you all this way for you to get in trouble in a dump like this. - No we came all this way to be stars right? Stars do whatever we damn please. - Now get those off. - If you want them off why don't you get them off? - If it'll keep you off the floor, why not? - I wanted to be the roller princess remember three years in a row. I loved to skate just float along and the wind goes through your hair and your eyelids. And you feel so free. Why don't we get out of here? - Oh why don't you get out of here? Take him with you. I'm staying with Buck, he knows his way around. Don't start that stuff here Velour. - Listen it's alright, I'll see that she gets home. You can take the car and I'll get us a taxi. - Wait a minute, hold it, hold it just a minute. I'm responsible for all, all the Pages do you hear me? - Well here's your manager Velour. - Watch you hands. - You watch my hands. Now listen to meet you James. The Pages are our property. Anybody fucks with our property we don't go to lawyers. You fuck with out property and I'll stick an ice pick in that golden ear of yours. - Hey watch your hands. - My hands I told you now. I'll put your head up on the ceiling. - Just watch your hands that's all. - I'll get you. - Hey baby you okay? - Yeah man I'm cool. - Well listen you know I'll put that guy in a sack for you. - No it's okay brother. Still alive with a one two count. Nobody on, nobody out. - The City Squire Hotel please. - I'm not going back there. - Where do you want to go? - To your place. Driver make that Western Avenue an 89th Street. - Alright. - Janice baby, wherever you are. - Did you know Janice? - I saw her once, God wat an ugly bitch. On the outside, you know on the inside she was beautiful. She's me turned inside out. - Sometimes pretty pays the price. - I paid my dues. You want to call for some dues too? - Whatever I want out of you Velour I'll get in the studio, standing up. - Well you're a first, you really are. I guess if I'd met you five years ago things might have been a little different. Ooh, look at that. - How would they be different? Was your father a single act before-- That pig's not my father. My Daddy ran off when I was three years old. How long have you known Franklyn? - Since I was in junior high school. See my Mama was a waitress in town where he played and he used to stay with us whenever he came through. He used to lay around all day waiting for me to come home from shool. If he ever touches me again I'm gonna kill him. - Did your mother know? - She must have begun to suspect something after a while. What the hell did she think he was waiting around for? You know she caught us one night in her own bed. - What happened? - Well Gary found her the next morning. She was kneeling in front of the oven like she was praying you know. It's a lot to carry. - She wasn't any bargain either. She brought that pig into our house. Buck, let's get down, come on. - No, somebody's gotta stay straight. - No no, somebody's gotta stay straight. - Somebody's gotta push those magic buttons right? - Right. Right, right, right. You're strange you know. You are. You've got a chip on your shoulder and you strut around like King George. But you're okay. You're okay. There you go man. - I don't have any change at all man. - Keep it man, I got my money's worth. - You don't have to pay anymore dues Velour, not with me. - This one's for me, I'm free, wired, and 21. You can take any liberty you want with me. - Okay, I'll be with you in a minute alright. - Okay. - Was the front door open? - Cleaning lady let us in, is that alright? - Yeah everything is a big hassle. - Hey listen man I'm sorry I haven't called you. - Yeah you haven't called. - I tell you wat man listen, I have a lot of work to do here this morning suppose I come by the wharf at night. - No be cool, dig this man, dig this. We've been knocked out of the studio man, knocked off the TV show. - Don't worry about what I'm doing. I told you I'll get back to you, I'll get back to you. - We believed in you man. I got mouths to feed. - Hold it many, hey. We signed man this record company. - That's right man you signed with the company and you're under contract. And you're professionals man. You aught to start acting like professionals. - Why don't you act like a professional man? - Are you with us, my friend? - I told you man, and I told you man this cat was no good. We been hanging out too long, later man. - I've nothing else to say, wish you cats would split. - Oh really? - Hey man you gonna let this guy talk to you like this man? - Since when did you become the leader? - Hey man look man, he done told what you happened man. You can't build this on dreams man. This is real man, we got to be real man. Let's go y'all. - Later on Buck. - Thanks Buck. - You see what you've done to me, to me, my friend. Man you a jive turkey. - You gonna make me a big star? - Yeah as big as they come. - Hi I just called your office. I thought were tired so I got you some Chinese food. - Hey listen Amanda. - I didn't know you were busy. - Well I am. - Sorry, I've only got enough for two. - Thanks honey, hope you remembered the soy sauce. - Right on, right on, right on, okay. And to continue with my winning streak folks I've got the pick hit of the week. Here's a whack that is so new it's warm and you can rub it all over your body. The group is the Page family, and they're on the A Chord label, a record company that really pays their dues. Hang around because Big John's gonna interview Velour Page right after you hear her talent. - Oh pick of the week, just like you promised. This is just the beginning. - I think I'm scared. Big John's okay-- - No, the whole thing. - It's what you always wanted. That's what scares me. What if I can't do it? - You've already done it, that signal is on it's way. You'll be number one in every city you visit. - Why don't you come with me? It's only five days, we'll go to California and Hollywood. - Oh I've got work to do here. - The Group? - That's right, that's right. - Oh please I need you. - We'll talk about it later alright. Okay, okay. - Step into my little home. Hey I gotta tell you folks this Velour Page looks like your basic homecoming queen. And you can get on my float any time. And I'd like to do the same for you. Hey Velour even before we start the conversation we have a question of the day here that we play I'm gonna ask you. How can you tell those girl chromosomes from the boy chromosomes? - I don't know. - You pull down their genes. Isn't that nice and nasty. Alright now it is crystal ball time. I am your super swami, you say to Big John Little hey Big John what's happening I mean what is happening? I can tell you one thing, the Page family are happening. I mean sweet as apple pie and right here with Big John. Tell me Velour how did you get the name? I mean that's such a nice warm and furry name, Velour. - Thank you my mom made it up. She took Valor which is an old family name and velour because she wanted more than anything else when she was a little girl a dress made of velveteen. That was her biggest dream. - That's really nice, well I'll tell you one thing. Mama Page is gonna have lots of Velveteen right now. - Well see that's my only regret. Mom's gone and we'll never get to put her in velveteen. But listen I want to ask you something. At a time when companies are really just not turning out any new releases, and virtually refusing to let unknowns get a break the Page family's coming along with this great big buildup, how come? - Well I like to think it's because we've got something to say that people want to hear. Mom always said when you sing from the heart. - Oh yes. - The whole world will hear you. I would have liked your mom and welcome to New York. Folks you are definitely gonna be hearing from The Pages for weeks, for months, forever. - Big John. - You got a Page there pal. - You know you ain't gonna last long in this business if you can't take it. - Hey listen before I forget the promotion department wanted me to tell you that we're running a big gig here at the station, big contest. We need about 1000 albums, but no garbage Bucky. You dig it? - They love me. - You're going to be a star. - You know what, I want to see Philadelphia. I want to see the Liberty Bell. - We haven't got time. And it's not on the way to the airport. - I'm a star. I want to see the Liberty Bell. Come on who the hell are you, my father or something? If I can't see the damn Liberty Bell whenever I want to then what the hell is all this about right? - Look the Liberty Bell is old, and it's small and it's cracked. You're gonna look at it and fell cheated and we're gonna miss our plane. - Really know everything don't you Mr. Buckmaster? - Look Velour, I came along to hold your hand because you were gut scared. Now anytime you know just let me know. I've got lots to do back in New York. - Like The Group? - Like The Group. Hi. - You know she is a natural. She just turns it off and on like a faucet. - Do you know what the most exciting part about being a star is? You see all the places that you ever read about. - Did you speak to the office today? Is the record moving? - Oh they are so excited. They're talking about it even bigger promotional tour. - And values, the history of America is just coming alive for me. Everything Mom and Dad taught me about and made me proud of is all becoming real. - You know if Miss America over there could only sing large she'd be a superstar. Doesn't she know that her voice comes out of your head? - And now I guess I'm a full fledged star. - And that's what they call the all American hype. - I hear the strip is a wild funky place. You've got to take me out one night. I bet you know where all the interesting places are don't you? - You bet I do. - Miss Page comes on like a walking talking Kewpie Doll carved out of maple sugar candy. Whether the pleasing musical qualities of her single are a tribute to her talent or Coleman Buckmasters is a question of time. The true Geiger counter of ultimate talent. I'm gonna Geiger counter that critic. I don't think it's funny. What if he's right? Buck? I want you. Look I need you. You know with you behind me I can have everything I ever wanted. I want you exclusively. - It's a one way street. - Come on. Just make my records mine, nobody else's. - Look Velour things don't really work that way. I think we're going to have to trust each other. - Trust? Buck The Group trusted you. I feel the same way about Early I feel about you. - I think the only way that I'd ever trust you, I mean really trust you is if you were married to me. - Look. This is really all too complicated, let's drop it. You're going to have to trust me. - An exclusive contract. You'll have me. You'll manage my career. You'll make my records and nobody else's. - Marriage, and your career, that's two contracts. - Yes. - Hold it a second will you? Geiger, Willie Geiger? Tonight for the opening monologue Willie will you hold the cue cards up close to the lens so I don't have to play the funny stuff to the damn floor? - You read this stuff? - Yes I do. - Let me just say we're a little nervous because we've never worked on the, thank you. We've never worked on the boob tube before. - Boob tube, say boob tube because we really like that here, it's funny. - Another thing about us you see we don't dance, we don't act. - I've heard. You move us in a position we just sort of-- - Stay there, lie there and-- - I'll be glad to work either standing up or sitting whichever you prefer. - I don't care, do you want to work standing or you want to work sitting? Gee this is exciting. - Well I tell you I'd like to work standing because I think is hard to hit. - Did you hear, that's funny I haven't heard that before. Alright they're gonna work standing. - The Pages are getting the biggest push in the history of this company. You can't afford not to get on this bandwagon. And I'm telling you as a friend. - Maybe. They sure that this thing's gonna be that big? - Oh come on, would I lie to you? - You only live once right? I never know when you're lying and when you're not. I'll take 10,000 pieces. - 10,000 pieces, you'll run out in a day. They'll tear your store apart. Your customers will go somewhere else and never come back. Buckmaster produced this and you know his friends. It's gonna be a a monster Teddy, Teddy a monster. - You only live once right. Let me have 15,000 pieces but don't boot me. - 15,000 pieces, make it 20,000 and I'll give you an extra 4000 on the house. But I want a window display. - Okay hot sell. - Did you get ahold of them? - Yep, everything's set. - I don't like the way they're standing together. Something's up. - You bet something's up, I straighten his head up about five days ago. - Can I trust you till then? - Can you trust me? Are you serious? - Velour, can you light her from the right? - What? - Velour, my daughter. - You named her Velour, terrific name. Hey guys when we're lighting Velour we're not lighting the curtain, we're lighting his daughter. Good name. - Yeah he looks good on the tube. - Color you know. - Just tied up a very heavy order. - You sold the Greek? - Keep up the good work. - Beautiful. - All it takes is genius, and a little of your money. - Looks like you've earned some of it in a bonus. - That's really music. - Listen, you pump this record up to number five on the Billboard you got your wife a new mink coat. I mean full skins, no paws. - I gotta go. - Hey, look at this. - Love it. - Mr. Cooper they want you up in the control booth. - They need me right? - Yes. - I got to do everything but clean the toilets. Alright people, 10 minute break everybody. - Is it alright if we go up to our dressing rooms now? - Oh and the artists may go to their dressing rooms if they desire. - Mr. Cooper, Mr. Mel Cooper please phone extension 831. What the hell are you doing in there? Are you nuts, how's he gonna work at that condition? - Keep the door closed. If he doesn't get off then he's just gonna mess up my sound. - Alright James what are you gonna do about this? - Look if she says he needs it, he needs it. You get him anything he wants as long as he goes on the air you understand? That's what you're here for. - Now wait a minute-- - Look that's your job. - This is a little more formal than I thought it was gonna be. - Strictly by the book. - Are these vows you are taking in front of these witnesses of your own free will? - They are. - Do you Velour Page take this man Coleman Buckmaster to be your lawfully wedded husband, to love and to cherish in sickness and in health for better or for worse until death do you part? - I do. - And do you Coleman Buckmaster take this woman Velour to be your lawfully wedded wife, to love and to cherish in sickness and in health for better or for worse until death do you part? - I do. - Then please place the ring on her finger. I now pronounce you man and wife. Good luck brother. - Oh I never thought I'd get you to go through with it. - I thought I wouldn't myself. But I decided to bite the bullet. - Hold on a minute. Mr. James, Mr. Barfield would like to speak to you. He says it's urgent. - You're kidding? What can we do about it? Yeah okay I think you're right. Yeah I'll get The Pages up here right away, tonight. Yeah okay. Get The Pages on the phone. Tell them I want them up here right away, now immediately. - Right away. - Okay fine. Hey Gare turn that thing off will you? You gotta get your bird in motion kid. We're due down at A Chord right away. - Mr. James will be right in. - Thank you. - Hello. Yeah she's here, just a minute. - Hello? - Have you seen the charts, Ellen. - Very nice. - I suppose I don't have to tell you we're already setting records with the jukebox industry. - I know. - I wish you would have been here a minute ago, Hollywood was on the phone. They called, they want The Pages for a movie. Those people I tell you, when they get wind that something's getting hot they want it. - And I can tell when something is wrong. - It's nothing really, nothing at all. We'll take care of it. Come on in sit down for a minute, make yourself comfortable. - Yeah you just better be sitting down because the next time I see. What, yeah hold on a second. James wants us in his office right away. - He wants me too? - Does he went Buck too? - He wants The Pages. But I'm not gonna go unless you go too. - Relax. - Hello. Thank you, yeah send them in. Buckmaster's here too. You may go in to Mr. James' office now. - Thank you. Hey you were gonna tell me something really important on the telephone, what was it? - Yeah what was it? - Come on let's go, I'll tell you later. - Come in, come in. The Pages, good come on in. Mr. Ferrara, Franklin Page, Gary Page. And this is our lovely little Velour. Mr. Ferrara is one of our major stockholders. Oh yeah this is Coleman Buckmaster, the man with the golden ear. Buck sit over there will you? Franklyn come in here, sit here. Gary, right here pal. Velour this is perfect for you. Thanks for coming everybody. Well, we're all together. First of all let me say this. The most important aspect of any relationship between a record company and its interests is mutual respect and integrity, a mutual trust. You entrust to us your finances. We in turn entrust you our image. Now sometimes unfortunately major artists when they become successful have a tendency to forget that it was a team effort that helped get them over the goal line. I'm sure that in your success you won't forget the team. - Absolutely, I want to tell you something James. We are all mighty grateful about the way you've been treating all of us here. - Thank you Frank and I know you're sincere. - And you know I wouldn't say it otherwise. - May I on behalf of A Chord Records say that we were very proud to consider The Page family now among our galaxy of stars. You know we have a reputation and have had for a long time dealing very fairly with our artists. It's a reputation that was established many years ago by Norman Shulman, our founder 27 years ago as a matter fact. To show our appreciation today I have a little something special for you. - What do you have in mind? Velour. - I've asked the attorneys to draw up a brand new contract for you. It will give the Page family all of the maximum royalties that befit major stars. We kind of like to have you sign this new contract and do away with the old one you signed so long ago down in Florida. I'd like to do it now while we're all together in a huddle. - Mr. James I want to tell you something. I think that is very very kind of you. I'd like to see my manager, Mike. Say Mike, are you sure you looked this over carefully? - Oh they're dynamite Frank, they're great contracts. I been over them with a fine tooth comb. What about the expenses? Two or three times more. It's all down there in the contract. - Let me get Gary in here. Gary see you, come over, Gary. It looks okay to me is there anything you want to ask Mike? - Do we get the money up front? - Up front, all written down right in the contract. Trust me. - Sounds okay to me. - Let's do it. - Let's go back. Well Mr. James if it's okay with our manager, it's okay with us. - That's great Frank. Listen I took the liberty of getting three brand new pens, one for each of you for a souvenir. - Keep it. - On the last page. - On the lats page. - There you are Gary for you. Velour, rouge. - Thank you, and Gary right under Franklyn. Very good thank you. And now Velour sweetheart please. - It's okay Velour, you can sign them. - She can't sign these contracts. - Hey Buckmaster take a walk. - Coach, I'm just trying to put some points up on the scoreboard. - I think it's about time you-- - Sit down. Talk fast. - By now your attorneys have examined the contract that Page has signed with the recording company in Florida. I presume they have notified you that there are certain legal deficiencies. Velour Page was 16 years old when she signed that contract. And she's chosen to disavow what she signed before she became of age. - Wait a minute you're an A&R man here. We've got an attorney with-- - James. Go on. - You see Franklyn's not her real father. - But just a minute, I'm her legal guardian. - You were never her legal guardian. And any minor has the right to disavow any agreements entered into before becoming of age. And any contract A Chord has with Velour is invalid because in legal terms she was an infant when she signed it. You must have something in mind. - I do. - The prettiest two words in the English language, I do. - Now wait a minute look you're under contract here too pal. You're in no position to start pulling this kind of stuff about what you think is right, what you think-- You act like a businessman too. - As Mr. James says I'm under contract to A Chord. - Your right he is. - And The Group is under contract to A Chord. But Velour Page is under contract to me. And I might add a valid and binding agreement. - That's very enterprising of you. Even a little opportunistic. - That's right. And now let me take this moment to propose a simple trade. I'll assign to you Velour Page's contract. And in return you'll give me my contract and The Group's contract. An even exchange and we'll be free and clear. And you'll have all The Pages, the whole book. - Wait I don't think I follow what's going on. - You know Buckmaster. - It's cool. - You are what's wrong with America today. You're supposed to be an artist. You're supposed to have soul. But you're just a schemer like them. When the artists of a nation act like politicians and businessmen we can expect a decline of greatness. Buckmaster you have talent. The Group has talent. I hope one day we can do business again. - You have a deal. We can exchange contracts tomorrow? You mean that's it? - That's it. - That's like a double cross to me. - You'll be alright. - No it's not so easy. You can't get rid of me that easy. Remember we're married, married. I can sign your name to every damn check I want to, every charge account I want to. There isn't a damn judge in the country who won't give me nine cents out of every 10 cents that you get. - Oh excuse me I didn't know there was anyone here. - Hey not now man. - Why did you do it? - That's the way of the world.
