I used to be a member of the bandit Later... ...I fell in love with a rich girl Her father found out about me... ...and he was against our marriage He set up a plot and parted us After that attack, I lost half of my skills Later, the girl killed herself... ...because her so- called respectable father... ...raped her So do you... agree I should hate everyone? How come you're so good to me? It's because... ...you bear a slight resemblance to that girl But, don't misunderstand I am not in love with you What I have is sympathy For the way they treat you, you shouldn't escape, shouldn't kill yourself We'll retaliate No girl has ever been able to escape... ...from Four Seasons Spring Brothel Go Yan Shunzi, you've lost most of your skills Are you trying to get killed?

I did Chief, he's the butler of the Liao Family Is this the master bedroom? No, this is his study room My Master usually slept in the lady's room Where... is the lady? She left with the young master and young miss... ...to visit her parents the day before So your master was all by himself... ...and study last night? Yes... hm... no Beg your pardon? Ainu was there too Ainu? There's someone here to see you, Miss Miss Ainu, Chief Ji, recently appointed, would like to see you You all please go out Yes Chief Ji, for you to be here, you're sure looking for enjoyment No, I am here on business Then must be something important I'd like to ask you, were you at Liao's house last night? Since when did the brothel... ...fall under your jurisdiction? No, it isn't about the brothel It's because Liao was murdered last night His servants said that... ...you were the last person to see him Are you inferring that... I killed him? No, I dare not But according to his servants, you left around midnight And based on the accumulation of snow, his time of death was around midnight too Then, did he die before I left... ...or was it afterwards? That... It's so simple If you can prove that he died before I left, then I must be the murderer, you may arrest me right now If you have got no proof, then let me tell you, he was still alive when I left He must've died after I was gone How could you prove that... ...he was still alive when you left? Then how can you prove that... ...he died while I was still there? Chief Ji I guess you are new in town Liao Guoqiang was a miser, an alcoholic and a sex- addict He ought to have been dead ages ago Why do you care for his death? Alright Chief Ji, anything else? If not, please leave as I am a bit tired, I'd like to rest now Goodbye Chief, you're leaving? Did you see that? Ainu killed Liao last night... ...and the officers are here What? Lady Chun, you shouldn't spoil Ainu... ...and you even taught her kungfu I think our business of ten years... ...will be jeopardized by her one day You... Don't forget You kidnapped a young girl ten years ago, and you were attacked from all sides, you had nowhere to go Had it not been for me... ...to save your life, do you think you'd be here now? For the last ten years, I left the martial arts world behind, and opened up this brothel for you This is such a disgraceful business for me, aren't you satisfied? You were willing to devote That's because I love you, Lady Chun Too bad! But I am not interested in men Love is strange indeed You love me, but I like Ainu But Ainu killed someone This time was Liao Guoqiang, Zhuo Wenjian, Li Zhangan will be next Then it will be you... and me Why? You... I am just testing your skills, and make sure if I'm still in control It's because Bao Hu is worried that... ...you will kill us one day Why did you kill Liao Guoqiang? For no particular reason I think I'm becoming like you, hating men, that's why I seek revenge This could mean that I'll love you more, and I don't yearn for the affection of men Then... were you excited... ...when you first had a taste of blood? Very much so But it's similar to the snow outside, totally tasteless Ainu Do you intend to kill me in the future? Of course not With you, it's like we're one in being If you die, how can I live alone? Ainu One frog jumped over the pond... plop Two frogs jumped over, jumped over... plop I drink... Li, what's going on? One frog jumped over the pond... plop Two frogs jumped over... plop If you do suspect Ainu, how about we arrest her, ok? Alright, I'll go No... I'll go... Enough nonsense The chief is new faction, must have his new working style But then, Ainu has strong patronage, we can't touch her Do you know her history? Whores have no history They're either forced or have volunteered It's the same story But the word is she's quite outstanding That's true Especially in bed Have you tried it? I can't afford to Ainu serves the rich and the famous I am just a small fry Besides... Ainu herself selects her clients, and won't let men select her No matter how rich you are, she gives a damn What kind of clients does she prefer? As I just mentioned, apart from the dead Liao, master Zhuo and master Wei Mr. Zhou, Miss Ainu is here Miss Ainu, you are here This way please You can wait for me outside Yes Please This way please Master, Miss Ainu is here Come... Please Do come in Please Come in... Go... What are you doing... Master Wei, we're here to save you Save me? Bullshit Someone here... Are you alright? Who might you be? Ji De, chief police officer What's the matter? Go to hell What's going on, master? Who is he? He's chief police officer He's asking for you outside earlier I am here to rescue you Rescue me? Sorry I was late, and made master scared Get out! Get out of here... Out! Now Right now, or I'll complain... ...to your supervisor tomorrow - Get out... Out Mr. Zhou, what's with your master? He's a bit worn out from... ...his experimenting all these years He only gets turned on by bondage now That's what it's all about Now you should understand, chief Let me buy you a drink, come on Have a drink... Let's go... Ainu, come on, hurry Ainu Come on What's with you? Come on, I want you What do you want? It's you I desire Wei Jianzhong Do you still remember the first time... ...you tied me up in bed? From that day on I swore, I will tie you up one day, and kill you The time has come It's your turn now Chief, what is it? I'm still worried You can't go in, chief The lights are off See, you wouldn't really want to intrude Don't, you bad boy God! The master's still got it Ainu is moaning The bed is making noise, let's leave C'mon... get going Wei Jianzhong, you never thought of this day, did you? Miss Ainu, you're leaving? You're still here, Chief Ji You must be worried That's why you waited for me here, isn't it? You better go check inside... ...or else you wouldn't know... ...if he's really dead Let's go What do you want, Chief Ji? I want to go inside to check out your master Master should be asleep right now If you want to go in, I'm afraid... Chief Ji, I think tonight... ...she wouldn't dare Oh, no... Fire Fire... Fire... Put it out Ainu Chief... Chief Ji, how can I help you? You set the fire to kill master Wei last night, I am here to arrest you Set a fire? Any witnesses? Sure wasn't any fire when I left But just after you left, the whole house was in flames Then it must've been someone else... ...who set the fire after I left I didn't see anyone going in Did you see me start the fire? Even though you didn't leave a trace, I'll have to arrest you today Chief Ji, not only you've no evidence... ...to prove that Ainu is the murderer Even if you've seen, you should've done your homework Do you know who owns Four Seasons Spring Brothel? If you really want to arrest Ainu, you should ask the governor's dad first Who is it? Good swordplay So it was you You've visited me twice, just returning the favour, this is my turn Do you want to tell me who's the murderer? No, on the contrary, I am here to ask you to step away Why? Why not? I'm backed by this Put down the sword Now... you will step away, won't you? Tell me Why do you try to stop me? It's for your own sake Otherwise, you'll be sorry What if... I won't listen? Fine, I'll tell you Zhuo Wenjian will be the next What? Nonsense You said Ainu wants to kill me? That's rubbish Old master, she means it for real Can't... it can't be You've got too much time on your hand You've nothing to do, and now want to interfere in my matter You... are you sick of being an officer? No, I dare not But Mr. Liao and Mr. Wei, they all took turn and... What's so strange about that? We all have to die sometime How could you make Ainu to hold responsible? However, old master, why could you not meet up with Ainu... ...to be safe? What? Master Zhuo, you don't want me anymore? Ainu, honey Ainu, my baby, who said I don't want to see you? I'd rather die than not seeing you My honey, baby Come over Yes What? Chief Ji, you want to join the fun? Master Zhuo, indeed this game, you two men can play together? Who said I want him to join? Get out Old master Get out! Get out now Yes None of your business here. Get out... Helper Dog, go bring the girls in Yes... Come... hurry in What are these three doing here?

I am the north wind If you want me, then need to see your capability Hurry... get me the wine... hurry... How is it, Master Zhuo? Perhaps it's time for you to rest Who said so? I am only on the west wind What happened... - Knock it down - Yes... What's going on... Don't move - Someone here - Yes Get the governor Yes Master... Father... You can't run this time - Cuffs - Here Wait Chief Ji, let Miss Ainu go She's the murderer, sir I said, let Miss Ainu go right now Didn't your hear me? Yes Allow me to take you home, Miss Ainu And I apologize for this incident Chief Ji, about what happened here, you can't let anyone know Why not? It's because the old master... ...died of an aphrodisiac overdose The governor's reputation is at stake, so you had better not tell anyone All men are the same They all lust after us I have watched them die one after another I am ecstatic with joy Liao Guoqiang, Wei Jiangzhong, Zhuo Wenjian... ...and one more Li Zhangan Heard he's returned from his escort job What? They all died? Yes I heard you four spent a lot of time together, that's why I come to warn you... ...to beware of Ainu Ainu can kill them because they all weren't versed in Kung Fu But I'll be a tough nut to crack Someone here Yes Bring Ainu here tonight Yes Master Li, Miss Ainu's here There you are They?. They will kill you... ...before you try to kill me If you really want to kill me, I think you can do it all by yourself You all get out Go... Why did you kill the other three? So that I can save my love just for you You men just don't appreciate If I want to kill you, where's the weapon? Come on, search me Come on Go ahead I asked you to search if I've a weapon, I am not asking you to hug me Well, you wanna sleep with me... ...one last time before you kill me? What's the hurry? Let me strip first you'll see if I've a weapon, then you can sleep with me Is Ainu here? Yes, she's inside What's the matter? I want to go inside This is a special door made by my master It can only be opened from inside, not from the outside You deserve to die, sex maniac You knew I am here to kill you, but you still lust after me You... Somebody, help... Knock it open You deserve this Never could you have thought that, this very special room you built... ...to abuse and ravage women, and you'll end up dying here Do you remember... ...the first time in here... ...when you whipped me? Is there no way in, except for this door? It's just this door, no other way knock it, come on Make way you guys, let's me try Go on in... He's already dead Chief Ji, you're a good officer, but you've caught the wrong person After her... Attack Hold it Chief Ji, two years back, I was like them... ...and got kidnapped from other places They sold me to Lady Chun It was a living hell I was coerced into prostitution I killed a few men I killed them... ...only for revenge If you're looking for the real culprits, arrest them Bitch Lady Chun... we've got a problem What is it? Big trouble! Ainu plotted against us They got intercepted at the gate What happened to Ainu? She turned out smart, and fled I thought she must've been hurt Lady Chun, didn't I tell you earlier The brothel will be ruined by Ainu Where're you going? I am going to kill her If the brothel is finished, we could start a new one at a different place However, I can't live without Ainu You... you're totally blinded by lust Ainu did this for revenge, why could you not wake up? She may hurt you but she'll never hurt me Because she and I, we're one - Attack Lady Chun, are you really fight... ...against us just for this bitch? I am not sure But I can tell you, no one can harm Ainu when I'm here Attack Attack This is scary Here's the key, release the girls from the backyard What to do... Go... hurry go... Hurry... get up... hurry Hurry... hurry run... hurry run away... Hurry... hurry go... Hurry go... get away Hurry... hurry go... leave fast... Mr.Bao?. Mr.Bao?. What is it? Big trouble! Ainu set the girls free, all of them Didn't you hear? I've said it before, no one can harm Ainu when I'm here Can't you see that... ...this is Ainu's revenge? Do you believe that? No way, she and I are the same person Lady Chun, I think we need to settle this once and for all You want to die now? Seems a bit too early Your yin-yang ghost hands aren't not much... ...stronger than my spine- chilling sword Why, Bao Hu? Even you give up your life, we will still be together I am not really sure The likes of you don't deserve my love, but it's too late for me Ainu, you wouldn't stop loving me... ...because I am handicapped now, right? No, I won't change... ...because I've never loved you Looks like this is it, today is the time for revenge At first, I wanted to use hate for vengeance, but I failed Later on, I hit on a better plan instead no one else would've used it before I used love to take my revenge I killed Liao Guoqiang, Wei Jianzhong, Li Zhangan, Zhuo Wenjian, by love To bring the Four Seasons Spring Brothel down, I used love to come between you and Bao Hu Never'd imagine, the damage love could cause is stronger than hate You... You... Didn't expect you to be more vicious than me Don't scold me We are both despicable, heartless, merciless, cruel and sick Now perhaps you'd have a glimpse of... ...how repulsive you are You don't need to take any action... ...as I am dying anyway I guess this is karma Even though you've killed me, yet I don't... I don't hate you a bit Ainu I... I love you Could you kiss me once more... ...before I die? It's... it's my last request Have pity, have pity on me please Thank you, Ainu Thank you for dying with me I had a poisonous pill in my mouth I was chewing it... ...when you kissed me You are unlike me You've still got your conscience, and a little love Ainu Ainu Ainu I am too late, Ainu Ai...
