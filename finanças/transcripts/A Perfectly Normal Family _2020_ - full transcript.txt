There. A PERFECTLY NORMAL FAMILY It's zoomed all the way in. There you are! There you are. Hi, Emma. Hi, Emma. Hi, sweetie. Is that you in the mirror? Is that you? There's your Mum. Your lovely Mum. And your lovely big sister, Caro. It's her bedtime. We'll go downstairs to watch football. Denmark is playing... ...a football match. Do you want to watch it with Dad? Eh? Do you? There we are. Hello! Hello, you. Are you a little football girl? Are you? Yes, you're a little football girl. Yes, you are! The first half went really well. You were ahead on goals. But as soon as they scored – you forgot all about our strategy and gave up. That's not good enough, girls! You have to keep fighting and fighting and fighting. Right? Are you listening to me? You keep fighting until the match is over. Right? Yes! You're bloody awesome, girls. I'll see you all on Tuesday. Can you kick it even harder? Let me see. Who's this now? Michael Laudrup with a shot. No, he holds it! It's brilliant! - Do you have to be so embarrassing? - Am I? Do you think I'm embarrassing? Get the ball off me. - Are you ready, sweetie? - Yes. See you! Bye. We'll go home and get Caro and Mum. They weren't ready to leave. You don't say? - Your new coach seems nice. - Yes, but she's not very good. - In what way? - Did you see her final substitution? Sally, who came on, is new to football. So it's stupid to let her play when we're losing. - Winning isn't everything. - Yes, it is. Surely not. It's also about getting you to work together as a team. It's the coach's responsibility to make that happen. - Hi, Emma. How did it go? - We lost. - Too bad. See you. - See you. It's just so annoying! We'd agreed with Kenneth that we'd make the Masters' League when we started playing U13. I'm sure that's what Naja is trying to do. She doesn't seem to know what she's doing. - Don't judge a book by its cover. - What does that mean? You don't know who people are until you get to know them. He's so cute! - Have you owned a dog before? - No. We're very excited. The girls have wanted one for years. And now we think... ...they're ready for it. Now they understand the responsibility. It's a big responsibility. You need to be ready for it. It's very important for us to find good families for the puppies. We will be a good family to him. We've already bought a basket, food bowl, toys... We've found a great dog training course. They seem very qualified. He's sleeping. - Look, Dad. He's sleeping. - He's so cute. Hello, you. - He's so sweet. - Can I hold him? He's very sweet. We've tattooed his ear, and he's had his first worm treatment. But the next one you'll need to administer yourself. - So we do that ourselves? - Yes, talk to the vet about it. He's so sweet. - Any other questions? - I think she feels unwell. I'll check. - Dad? - He went outside. Please don't, Thomas. Dad? Can we call him Raúl? Not right now, sweetie. Let's go home. Come on. - We have to leave now, sorry, so... - Okay... Yes. Caroline? Caroline, come on. Damn it! Calm down! - Caroline, are you coming? - But Dad's not back yet. Yes, he is. If we're not getting a dog, I'm never going to school again. - Of course you're going to school! - No! Not until we get a dog. - Caroline? - Hi. Here are the pizzas. Caroline! - Yuk, is that Gorgonzola? - Yes, that one has Gorgonzola. And... this one with pepperoni is for you. - What else is there? - Then there's... Hawaii. Aren't you joining us, Helle? Dad and I are getting a divorce. What? What a strange thing to say. Mum and I need to talk about this properly. - No. We've already talked. - No, because you won't listen to me! You've already made up your mind. Right? Do you want to tell them yourself? We're getting a divorce because... ...Dad wants to be a woman. What do you mean? Dad wants to change gender because he feels like a woman. You can't just decide that for yourself. Actually, you can. Dad's been doing assessment sessions at the hospital since September. And apparently, he has started hormone therapy now. - Helle... - It's the truth, isn't it? - Or have you already had the surgery? - No, of course not. Is it a disease? - No. - Then why did you go to the hospital? - That's just the way it is. - Does that mean we're moving? Well, we need to decide what to do about the house. Couldn't we take it easy now? - What about my confirmation? - I don't know, Caroline! - You can't just cancel it. - That's not the issue right now! Sorry. Emma, I wish it wasn't this way. It has nothing to do with you guys. I've always felt this way. Then why did you have children? - I found one. - Great! Easter Bunny, where did you put the Easter eggs? - Emma, did you find one? - I've only found two. Here's another one. I just found one in the grass. There are some over here as well. Try looking around here. - This one is for me. - Did you find one? Can I see? - Look at this! - Nice. Can you find more? Yes. - Are you not joining in? - The Easter Bunny's nice this year. - Can you please join in, Thomas? - What? Can you please join in instead of filming? Sure. Hello, Helle. Hello, Caroline. Hello, Emma. I'm so glad you're joining us today. - Helle, can I talk to you for a second? - Sure. - Have you spoken to Thomas today? - No. He just called to say that he'll be wearing women's clothes today. I don't understand. He promised that if Emma came today, he would come as Thomas. - Welcome. - Thank you. I'm so glad that you're all here. Helle, Thomas and I have agreed that we'll focus on what you, Caroline and Emma, need in this process – so that you'll better be able to cope with what's going on with your dad. And let's agree that nobody leaves. If you need a break, of course that's fine. Just let me know, so it doesn't go all haywire. - Can I just say...? - No, wait a minute, please. Would you, Caroline and Emma, like to say something? No. No. Great. - Yes, Helle? - Thank you. I find it really hard when Thomas doesn't stick to our agreement. Emma hasn't wanted to meet her dad since August. It was really hard for me to convince her to come today and then he turns up looking like that. He doesn't care about the girls. - That's not true. - Helle and Thomas, please remember... Can I just ask a question? Why did Thomas say that if Emma came - - he wouldn't show up as a woman? I didn't say that. That was your condition. - So it's my fault? - No. I've been getting hormone replacement therapy for six months, so I find it a little weird, that we have to pretend this isn't happening. So now it's weird to pretend? Helle and Thomas, please don't just throw allegations at each other. Right. Very good. Helle, will you try to phrase what you think Emma needs? - Emma can nod if she agrees. - Well... I think that everything's happening way too fast for her. What's happening with Thomas, we're getting a divorce and we sold the house. - You wanted the divorce. - Thomas, please wait for your turn. Please let Helle phrase what she thinks Emma needs. - Yes. - Great. I think Emma needs Thomas to postpone his trip to Thailand. - You know very well how hard it is... - I don't understand the urgency! I can't wait any longer! Caroline and Emma, I love you more than anything. But I can't live like this anymore. I've tried to be the father that I thought I needed to be. And I really hope that I can still be your dad even though it's hard. And now... that you're both here... ...I want to tell you that... I've decided that I want to be called Agnete. Okay. Yes. - So should we address you as Agnete now? - Yes, please. - I can't do this. - Helle, Helle... I'll just check that she's OK. I think Agnete is a great name. Thanks, sweetie. - It was my grandmother's name. - Really? - Yes. Do you remember her? - No. Oh! That's my phone. Sorry! - I have to answer this. - That's fine. Hello? Why don't you just take off that scarf? You're so childish! Right! We're back. - Sorry. - That's okay. I know this is a very difficult situation for all of you. You need to acknowledge that this will take a long time. I'd like us to perform a parting ritual for Thomas. Since there isn't a funeral where we can say goodbye. But Dad isn't dead! No, but it's important that you and I say a proper goodbye to Thomas. Don't tell me what's important to me. It's great that you tell her how you feel. I'm not going to a funeral for my dad who isn't dead! I didn't mean a funeral as such. I meant that we need to say goodbye. - This is so screwed up. - No... Caroline, listen to me! I'll talk to them. Emma, I think I'd better leave now. It was great seeing you, even though... Yes. See you, sweetie. Wait! Do you promise you'll still be my dad? Yes, I promise. Hi. Hi. What happened to your shoes? It's Raúl, that scoundrel. He keeps eating all my shoes. But it's hard to be angry with that dog. How long will you be gone? Almost two months. Do you want to meet up when I'm back? I'm winning an ice cream. Come on! No, I am! Okay, if you can get a goal in, you'll win an ice cream. I'll be the goalie. - Try to score. - And then I'll get an ice cream! And I'll get an ice cream! An ice cream! No! No! No, Dad. It hit the goal post! Can you score from there? - Yes. - Go get it. Doesn't Dad live near the swimming pool? - Yes, but I need to buy sanitary pads. - Does Dad get periods now? What? - That's not possible. - What do I know? She's just had breasts and a vagina done... - Do you think I'll recognise her? - Of course you will. But doesn't she look completely different? Don't be worried. Come on. - Hi, Agnete! - Hi! Careful so Raúl doesn't run. Hi, Raúl! You've gotten so big! I'm just taking the cake out of the oven. Here it is. Well... - Hi! Hi, sweetie. - That's a nice dress. Thank you. Hi, Emma. Hi, sweetie. I've missed you! Hi, you! Come on in, sweetie. I've made a cake. We're in here. - It smells lovely, Agnete. - I'm glad, sweetie. Let's hope it tastes good as well. Right, Emma... I had these every day in Thailand. - Here you go. - Thank you. - It tastes so good! - Yes, it tastes lovely. - Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers, sweetie. I've got a present for you guys. For you, Caro. And for you, sweetie. - It's so pretty! - Yes, isn't it just? It's nice for the beach. There's more. - Are we going to Mallorca? - I think we've deserved it. - Thank you! - You're welcome, sweetie. Then I can get a tan before my confirmation. Well, the weather there is amazing. Don't you like it, Emma? You know I don't like pink. Raúl! Really! Come here! Now we need to wipe that up. - Why are you being so mean? - I'm not. You are! We don't want you to come on holiday with us if you behave like that. That dog is really something else. There. Emma, you haven't seen your new room yet. One more step. And the last one. You made it all the way up. Now turn right. Yes. And straight forward. There's a doorstep. Yes. And... stop. Tada! Do you like it? I'm glad to hear, sweetie. Caroline and I furnished it. Caro picked the colour on the wall. She also picked out this inflatable chair. Which I don't quite get. It's really cool. Yes. What do you want to do today, sweetie? I've rented some movies. Or we can play some board games. - But I have a match at 3 pm. - Today? - Yes, it's Sunday. - Of course. - Shall I drive you? - That's all right. I can walk. No, of course I'll drive you. I just need to rest for a bit first. Do you want to take Raúl for a walk? I think he needs a good run. Come on. Now, now, you! - Hi. - Hi, sweetie. - Are you ready? - Yes. Then we'll leave in a minute. - What's Agnete doing? - What? - What's Agnete doing? - She's dilating. What's that? It's something she has to do every day now. - Why? - To expand her vagina. Emma, are you coming? - Now go and kick Husum's arse. - Yes. It was lovely to see you, sweetie. - Emma? - Yes? Would you like me to stay and watch the match? - But what about Caroline? - I'm sure it's okay with her. - We have a tactical meeting first. - That's fine. I'll wait here until the match begins. - Okay. - See you out there! - Can we play? - Sure. Casper, you can play defence. - Shall I play offence? - Yes. - Did you see Roberto Carlos' free kick? - It was crazy. Sweetie? You forgot your boots. Hi. - Hello! - Hello! I won't interrupt. Have a good game. Girls, come up here. Boys, get out. Boys? What did I tell you? Get out! Great. I need your full concentration, girls. Look here. We'll have two players midfield and one striker. Listen up, Emma! You're not moving around, girls! Come on! To your left. Come on! - Close that gap! - Be careful... Keep fighting, girls! Come on, sweetie! Come on, Emma! Come on! Emma, that was your ball! - Remember our agreements, girls! - Come on! - What are you doing? - Calm down. - What are you doing, Emma? - You told me to get the ball. Emma? What's up, Emma? That was completely out of order! You really hurt her. She could have broken something! - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. - Do you want to come home for dinner? - No thanks. Okay. Are you going home to Mum? Yes. - How do you open it? - That's how you do it. I think you can open it there. What do you think it is? I don't know. - A football! - Really? A football? - Was that what you wanted? - Yes! How cool! - The chocolate has melted. - What? The chocolate has melted. - That's the phone. - You need to answer it. On your birthday you have to answer the phone. Yes. Answer the phone. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Emma... - Who is it? - I think it's Grandad and Grandma. Happy birthday! Did you get some nice presents? Yes! A football! - Was that Grandad? - Yes! And she's off again. - Everyone sends their love. Bye. - Bye. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Agnete! - Happy birthday! - Thank you. Thanks, sweetie. Thanks, sweetie. - We have a present for you. - Really? You shouldn't have. - Pick a hand. - That one. It's so sweet of you. How exciting. A card. "Dear Agnete. Happy birthday. We love you." Thank you. - And what's this? - A gift card for a manicure. - Great! - You have an appointment at 10 am. Lovely. - That's when we're playing mini golf. - That was their only available slot. We'll just play mini golf afterwards. Right, sweetie? We're on holiday. We've got all the time in the world. How lovely. Why don't we all get a manicure? - Yes! - I think we deserve that. It's the best birthday ever. Thanks, sweetie. Thanks, sweetie. I really need a manicure. Look. I chipped a nail yesterday. - Are you enjoying your holiday? - Yes. What have you been doing? We've been to the beach and at the pool, and today we're playing mini golf. And watch football. So much fun! So pretty! - You have such beautiful daughters. - Thank you. - Like mother, like daughters. - Thanks a lot. That's sweet. Okay, now you have to... Two seconds. Sorry. Why didn't you tell her that you're not our mum? We don't know her. It's too complicated to explain everything. - But you're not our mum. - Emma, does it matter? Okay. So what colour would you like? - Which colour do you want, sweetie? - I don't know. - Maybe... What do you think? - Yes, that's nice. You love green. Dos. Can I see the score? Yes! You really need to make an effort now, girls. Okay... Right. Number 11. - It looks difficult. - Yes. You need to shoot at a straight angle. You're doing well, sweetie. Don't laugh at me. Try a softer swing. - I can't do it when you laugh at me! - It's okay to tease the ones you love. Moody. It was meant in fun. Here you are. I don't want to play anymore. - These ones? - Yes, that's perfect! I'll move yours. There you go. Phew! We've certainly found Los Paradisos. - Do you want to go swimming? - Yes. - I'll just apply some sunscreen. - Okay, I'll go out then. Don't go out too far. - Don't you want to come swimming? - This is my youngest daughter, Emma. Hi, I'm Petra. Petra and her daughters are also staying at our hotel. Chantal and Stephanie. - Obviously teenagers. - We have one as well. - Don't you want to come swimming? - We're just talking, sweetie. So you have big birthday plans for tonight? No, not really. We're having dinner at the hotel. I love it there! It's really good. Do you like it? You should join us. It could be so much fun. A birthday party! - I'd like it. - The kids would love it as well. Right? - But what about the match? - We'll have an early dinner. - Everything okay? - Yes. It's just... Kids, right? Emma, wait for me! Is it cold, sweetie? - Cheers and thanks for joining us. - Thank you for having us. - How do you say "cheers" in Dutch? - Prost. Prost, sweetie. - We say skål in Danish. - Skål? Skål! - The wine's good. - Yes. Here's the waiter. Shall we sing? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Agnete Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you! Hip, hip, hip, Hurray! - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Thank you so much! Did you order this? - I don't know. - You totally did. It's beautiful. Did you see how the waiter looked at you? - No, he didn't. - Oh yes, he did! - Agnete, the match begins in a minute. - Emma, please don't stress over it. - Hand me your plate. - Are you okay? She wants to watch a football match. You like football? That's really sweet. To me, it's just people running after a ball. I never got the rules or anything. Something about making goals. - They have to be handsome. - Yes, that's the rule. When it comes to football, me and your mother are real idiots. Please tell her you're not my mum. Please don't ruin this evening for me. Hand me your plate. What are you doing? I just want to go home. Why are you being like this on Agnete's birthday? Can't you just accept her the way she is? Hi, sweetie! Come, Emma. - I'll wait downstairs. - Okay. - I'm ready! Come on out, girls! - Okay. Wow! You look amazing! Oh my god! Are you a princess, Emma? - No, I'm a queen! - I see. - And I'm a princess! - You're very beautiful, ladies. Yes. Dancing ladies. Twirl for me. Right! Ladies and gentlemen! Helle and I would like to welcome you to Caroline's big day. We've looked forward to seeing you all here today. I must remember to introduce Peter. Peter is the toastmaster as requested by Caroline. So if anyone would like to give a speech, please talk to him. And Peter's a devil on the dance floor. So be careful. Dear Caroline... Fourteen years ago, you came into our lives. We were very young, your dad and I. But you were a wonderful little girl. And you enriched our lives insanely. Er... Somehow you knew it was New Year's Eve even though you hadn't been born. Even back then you didn't want to miss out on a party. You always want everybody to be happy. That showed in the preparations for today. You've spent months organising everything down to the last detail to ensure that everyone will have a lovely evening. The saying goes that you're now an adult. Of course we know that you've felt like an adult for a long time. But for Mum and me, today marks the day when you're no longer our little girl. It's no secret that it's been quite a tumultuous time for our family. Last year, when I told you guys how I felt... ...I was so afraid of losing you and Emma. But you showed me that I didn't have to be afraid. That reaction and the love you showed me was more than I dared hope for. And I would like to thank you for that. - So thank you. - I think... - I think we'll... - Yes. I propose a toast to Caroline. How do we do it, Peter? - Three cheers and a long hurrah. - Absolutely. Long live Caroline! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! And the long one: Hurraaaah! - Cheers! - Congratulations. - Cheers, sweetie. Are you having fun? - Yes. Ladies and gentlemen! I now give the floor to Caroline's maternal grandfather, Leif. Thank you. Dear Caroline. I'm not going to bore you with a long speech. So Grandma and I wrote a song. It's weird for us old folks that you're old enough to get confirmed. - Yesterday, when Thomas and I went... - Agnete. - Sorry? - I'm called Agnete now, Leif. Of course, Agnete! I just have to get used to it. I'll get there. Where was I? Ah, yes! I told her that it felt like only yesterday when he... ...she... called to tell me that I was now a grandfather. That was a huge moment. Well, let's sing the song. You've all got a copy. It goes to the tune of "From England to Scotland", and please join in. Are you ready? One, two, three! On New Year's Eve, the Queen's speech went out throughout the land the phone rang off the hook, and Thomas said "it is a girl!" oh blimey me, my dear! we came from miles away and Caroline attended our New Year's party night. Cheers! Congratulations! I'll go back in. - Hi, sweetie. - Hi. - Are you all right? - Yes. I just felt hot. Before people leave, we'll hear from someone who means a lot to you, Caroline. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the one and only: Emma! Dearest Caro, older sister, this is your big day you've been looking forward to party with all of us I just want to tell you all about my life with you we do a lot of stuff together when you can stand me you can scream and shout, "god damn it!" "get lost", and you hate me so when I don't want to do the same as you dearest Caro, older sister, you're beautiful and cool you dance just like Britney Spears I admire you lots do you remember years ago we camped out overnight? suddenly I heard a bang when you let off a fart you're the bestest big sister, you always know just what to do I love you more than you think you know dearest Caro, newly confirmed now I've had my say we will party all night long until the break of day I hope this will be the day that you will remember the best and now I'll end this song with a really loud cheer I'm asking all the lovely guests to please be upstanding and cheer for you until you have enough - Don't you want to join in, Grandad? - I thought you'd never ask! - Hello there! - Hi! - What are you doing? - We're making Christmas cookies. Delicious. What type of cookies? - I'm making a moon. - And how about you, Caro? Eh... I'm making a Christmas tree. And a heart. - I'm making a moon and a heart. - Nice. Can I try one? - No! - Why not? - Not until they've been baked. - I see. - Mum said that. - Yes. Mum is so strict. - No. - Beautiful Mum is here. Hello, hello! - There. Is it too tight? - No. There we are. Yes! Walk around. You look like a star, sweetie. Really nice. Stay there. Okey dokey. Look at this. Great... Look down. Focus on something. Keep looking down. Just focus. Will there be any cute boys at the party? - Yes! - Two goals in a row! It's like Raúl against United. If you hold them like this, you'll stand better. Thanks. - I can't believe Real defeated United. - I know! Del Bosque is a great coach. When they play Barca, they'll get thrashed. Yes, Real will never defeat Barca. - Yes! - Well done. Have you heard that thing about Emma's dad? - Did you see the dress? - It's probably her dad's. Apparently, it's hereditary. Do you want some? So did your dad have his dick cut off? Or what? Gross. Emma, let's go inside. You go ahead. Hey, don't drink it all. Do this... And keep going. Emma? Emma? Go get Naja. Are you okay? Emma? I'm sorry. Don't go to sleep, Emma. What's going on? - Emma? - Damn. - What the hell did you guys do? - She drank vodka. - Emma? - Naja. Will you get Henrik to call her parents? Come on. You need to sit up. - Will you get her some water? - Yes. Can you hear me, Emma? Do you need to be sick again? Are you sure? There, there... Drink this. You have to. - Great. Hi. - Hi. Hi, Emma! How do you feel? - What are you doing here? - Caro and I've come to take you home. Go away. Go away! - Sweetie... - I hate you. - I hate you. - Sweetie... I hate you! - What did she drink? - Vodka. - Right. We have to go to the A&E. - I hate you! Yes. Come on, get up. I wish my dad was dead. Right... - Can you tell me your name? - Emma. - Good. And your last name? - Dalgaard. - I'm sorry? - Brandt Dalgaard. Emma, look at the light. Very good. How much did she have to drink? - We're not quite sure. It was vodka. - Has she been sick? Yes. Before we got there and twice after. I don't think we need to perform a gastric lavage. - There can't be much left. - Isn't it still dangerous? Yes. That's why children shouldn't drink alcohol. - We can keep her in overnight. - Yes, thank you. Emma? I'll find you a bed. Thank you. Sweetie... Hi, you! - How are you feeling? - Not great. I got you a Coke. Do you want it? Yes. - Do you want to sit up? - Yes. Oops! - Is that okay? - Yes. - Here you are. - Thank you. Whoops! Sorry. I didn't mean to. My sweet darling! You can't do that! Emma... Er... Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. We'll be right back. I don't know what happened. They drank alcohol at the party. Don't you think there's a connection? - So it's my fault? - She isn't well. I can see that, but she was fine at my place, all right? I saw a documentary about the video for "Oops, I Did It Again". She's talented. - Hi! We've booked a lane. - What's the name? - Agnete. - Agnete, Agnete... There! Lane number five. What size shoes do you want? - Emma is a 4.5, right? - Yes. - And I'm a size 5.5. - 5.5. - And I'm a size 10.5. - Sure. Sure. Apparently, while they were shooting the video, she hit her head on the camera. There was blood everywhere. And that's not even the worst bit. Thanks. She had to have four stitches and probably had a concussion. But she still got up and kept on dancing. - Impressive. - Yeah! - Right... Was Emma first? - Yes, the youngest begins. She's just an incredibly skilled dancer. But I constantly hear people calling her unintelligent or stupid. They're judging her for being blonde. But they don't know her. - That's mean. - Right? It's condescending. Yes! Well done, sweetie! You get another go. Wow, you're so good! I'll just embarrass myself after that. Caro? Hang on. I need to tell you guys something. Please sit down. - I've got a new job. - Okay. - I'll start it in June. - Great. It's in London. What do you mean? The company I'll be working for is located in London. So I'm moving there. What about us? You'll stay here. If you're moving to London, I want to come. You have to stay here with Mum. You've got school here. But you can come over for holidays and... ...some weekends, and we can explore London together. I think that would work out fine. Caroline... You can't just abandon your children! I'm not abandoning you. Then what are you doing? - Caroline, please sit down. - I don't want to. - Are you okay, Caro? - No, I'm bloody not! - So you got your way after all. - What do you mean? You said you wished Dad were dead. - Caroline? - Leave me alone! It's your fault she's moving, so just leave me alone. - I just wanted... - Don't! - Squirt! - Squirt! Squirt! Is that enough? Come on, sweetie. Yeah! - Hi, Dad! - Hi. You're so brave! Yeah! How do you think the Champions League Final today will play out? First of all, it's really interesting to see two Spanish teams play each other. Especially since neither Real Madrid nor Valencia did very well in La Liga. But both teams have played well in the Champions League - especially Real Madrid, since Del Bosque took over from John Toshcak halfway through the season. They defeated Bayern Munich and Man. United who played the final... It's impressive for Real Madrid to defeat both Bayern Munich and Man. United. But Real are insanely skilled. - Do you think we'll win? - Don't embarrass yourself. - Hi! - Hi! Come on in. Thank you. Hello, you. Come on, sweetie. Wow! - Hi! - Hi. Hi, sweetie. It's so good to see you. - What about Caroline? - She didn't want to come. - I've packed Raúl's things in this. - Right. - Emma, sweetie? - Yes? I've packed some stuff for you and Caro. It's just the last bits and bobs. This is what was left. The dog's leash... - Yes. Thanks for all your help. - Sure. Bye. Right... I'll see you after the summer break. - Then we'll go sightseeing in London. - Yes. I must finish packing before the taxi gets here. Sure. Take care of yourself, sweetie. I love you. - See you soon! - Yes. Have a safe trip. Thank you. - Bye, Raúl. Bye, Helle. - Bye. - Come on, Raúl. - Up! Good boy. I'll see you at the club, sweetie. I won't be too early. - Hi, Emma! - Hi! - Are you going to the club? - Yes. Will you be watching the match? How do you think it'll turn out? - Real will win by 2-1. What do you say? - 3-0. It's so exciting. - My dad's moving to London today. - Why? She got a job there. - Are you upset about it? - It's probably for the best. Why is that? That way, we can visit her and go sightseeing and stuff. Won't you miss her? Emma? Sweetie? Are you all right? Is something wrong? - We're ready. - Yes, just a second. Emma, are you all right? I want you to stay. I can't do that. Emma, sweetie... I understand you're upset, but I'm sure it'll all get easier for you when I'm not here. - Just forget it. It doesn't matter. - Emma? Thank you. First of all I want to thank all you girls for your work this season. I've enjoyed coaching you and getting to know you better. Give them a big round of applause. Today, we're handing out awards. I want to start with Player of the Year. The award goes to a player who's immensely dedicated. Player of the Year for the girls' U-12 team is: Sara. Join me up here. A T-shirt. Put it on. - And here it is. Congratulations. - Thank you. I'm so happy. Girls, you all rock. I'm playing for the best team in the world. There you have it. The next award goes to Fighter of the Year. I'm very pleased to hand this to a player who only a year ago raced around on the pitch and wanted to win so bad that if something went wrong, she completely lost heart. You now know that it's about mental strength and that you need to keep fighting. You've been fighting to play in the Masters' League. And after the summer break, girls, we'll be playing in the Masters' League! Emma! You've learned that it's not only about winning. It's about fighting and never giving up. Not just for your own sake, but for your team's. Emma, please join me up here. A T-shirt. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations, you rock. Go on. It's okay. I'm very grateful for this. There you are! Mum said you got the award for Fighter of the Year. Of course you did. Agnete left. Emma, she will always be our dad. Right? The Champions League Final is on. Come on. Come on. Hello! Come, come, come! Come here.
