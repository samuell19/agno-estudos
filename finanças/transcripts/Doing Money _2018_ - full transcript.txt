Sometimes I think every man in the city understands I was doing money. Do they understand I was someone who could not say no? Ana? Thanks for calling us. I just want... They have a girl. A slave. So young, so small. A star, branded here on her wrist. They call her Skinny, but her name is Daniela. Is she in Sweden? Erm, we can't give you that information, I'm sorry. So, you tell me nothing and want me to tell you everything? MUSIC: Ho Hey by The Lumineers I don't think you're right for him Think of what it might have been if you'd Took a bus to Chinatown # Hey I'd be standin' on canal # Ho... # Your money's on the hall table.

Blind, look! IN ROMANIAN: Speak English, blind cow. ANA: You are thinking, why doesn't she scream, like they do in the movies? Because it's not like it is in the movies. Ana from Sibiu, I know all about her already. And I know her Mama. Her mama, who is called Ana, too. I know what can happen to her if you make any more trouble. ..94. Issued in Bucharest. PHONE RINGS Oh, Susan. I work for her. Baby, you work for me. In real life, you have no breath to scream. Go. Move. Move! I need the bathroom. 143 Boulevard Rada Lupu. Your mama lives there. Remember, Blind One, I see everything. Now, shut up and move. Good morning. This one looks good. This one will do money. At home in Romania, we hear about the girls who are groomed. The girls who are tricked into falling for men's stories. "Silly girls," we all think. But I'm not a silly girl... ..and nobody has groomed me, or tricked me. The men are Romanian, like me. They have stolen me off the streets of London, and all I can think is - nobody knows where I am. Not even me. What else have you got? Only the best for Ancuta. PHONE RINGS Hello, baby. No, sorry, she's not here, but I have a lovely new girl waiting just for you. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Do as you're told! PHONE RINGS You two have fun now. Welcome to Galway. HE CHUCKLES Best place on Earth. You look beautiful. Come and sit here. Come on, darling. Come on. And the races are on. HE CHUCKLES All the pretty girls in all their hats and their... Lie back there. I don't want to be here. I want to go home. Listen, I want to go home. Listen... And we like to please our ladies. No, I don't want to. No, I said no. If that's the way you like it. No, I said no! Get off! Don't touch me! Get off! Get off! Get off! God in heaven! Ancuta! Ancuta! Get out! We'll get you another girl. She's mad! She's bloody mad! A fine way to treat an honest customer! You don't want to do it for money? Fine. You can do it for nothing. I'm no good to you. Let me go home. Home as in London, where the only job you're good for is cleaning? Or home as in Romania, where there's no job for you at all? I was studying to be a nurse. She thinks she's too good for us. ANCUTA SNIFFS Teach her a lesson. No. No. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! PHONE RINGS Silly bitch. It's only sex. ANA SOBS AND SHOUTS You lads! Cut that noise, now! Skirt off. Arse out. Stick it out. Mm-hm. The other one - off. Now pick up the sign. OK. Blind One, meet Skinny One. So, the split's 50-50 for all my girls, except Blind One, who likes it so much she does it for nothing. No, I'm here to do webcam. No sex. That's what my boyfriend told me. Wear pretty clothes and just talk to the camera, is what he said. Is that toast? Can I have some? You don't do money, we don't feed you. So, it's 80 euros for half an hour, 140 for an hour. Extra for anal, cum in mouth, without condom. If they ask for the girlfriend experience... ..Skinny One, you know how it works. What are you doing? Shh! Stop. Lily, you need to wake up, stop her. I have to get out. They've got your passport, right? Your clothes and your glasses. How far are you going to get in your knickers in a foreign country? The window is nailed down. Now, can we all get some sleep? Work with me and eat. Fight me and starve. Your choice. Get up! You two have fun now. Hello, Natalia. I'm Declan. I'm not Natalia. Ah, well, never mind. You're very pretty. Clock's ticking. I'm not going to have sex with you. Oh, no, see, that's... that's where you're wrong. Because my money's as good as the next man's. ANA GASPS BANGING We have a warrant to search your property! You're under arrest. POLICE RADIO CHATTER That's fine. That's good. Cover yourself up, for God's sake. Have you no shame at all? Passport? ID? The pimps took them, but I can give you the details. I was born in... Sibiu, Romania, yes. It says so on this tenancy agreement, which is in your name. No, that can't be right. My officers found 1,500 euro, mobile phones, and records of clients' details, in a holiday house rented in your name. You'll appear in court in the morning. Can I call my mother? Please. A night in the cells, a wee fine, and tomorrow you're a free woman. Why don't they arrest the men? What are we guilty of, exactly, compared to them? Their wives are cold. They don't get enough sex at home. Idiot. It isn't sex though, is it? It's rape. We go along with it. It's our job. You think you're special, Ana? You're just a hole. She's a hole. I'm a hole. That's how men are. Not my man. He loves me. Mm. Can I call my mother, please? Could you just shut up about your mother? We all have mothers. And some of us have children, too. HORN HONKS 300 euros. It's nothing. It's not the money, Lily. If she starts on about running away again... I've got a criminal record - and who will believe me? Nobody. So, that's 1,000 for the week. Extendable, just pop by the office. Family holiday, is it? Oh, yeah, we love it here. It's so friendly. OK, enjoy. Thank you. So, that's Â£1,000 the three of you owe me, for starters. Blind One, close curtains. Hello. I want to restart my profiles on a new country code, yes. From Republic of Ireland to United Kingdom, 0044. Rachel? Look at this girl. Spanish, apparently. Isabella. The one with the star on her wrist? She's never over 18, is she? Boss. Would they ever be daft enough to bring an underage girl over here? Underage makes the most money. The star again. Italian, now, apparently. That's the same wee girl. Find out where they are. Let's pay her a visit. PHONE RINGS Hello, baby. It's Declan. I've booked the porn-star experience with Natalia. She's waiting for you. I'm on the square. Now, you see the glass door? Straight ahead? Mm-hm. OK. Press number 93. DOOR BUZZES I'm in. She's longing to see you. Declan, he's a pervert. Look, he's an arsehole, I agree... ..but I've had worse. He wanted it to hurt. They all want it to hurt. PHONE RINGS Before I went on maternity leave, there was a woman on every corner. Local women can't compete, now. There. Security guiding him in. Textbook. Hi, that's our mark approaching the door now. Yep. Copy that. We see him. You don't look much like your photograph. You do do what it says on your profile? On the website. Where it says the things that you like to do. I have never seen my profile. And there is nothing I like doing. BANGING ON DOOR Police! Stop where you are! Detective Inspector Grant, Police Service of Northern Ireland. I have a warrant to search these premises. No, listen, listen, my wife doesn't need to know about this, surely to God. Look, I have kids. We were just talking. Put on your shirt. We were just talking. Nothing really happened. I mean... I'm putting on my shirt, but look, will you just listen to me for, like, two minutes. I wasn't... I wasn't doing anything. I have kids. Check the room for luggage labels... Do you want to take a seat? We just want to ask you some questions. You're not in any trouble. You're not going to be arrested. We're not going to involve the immigration authorities. We're not here to take your money. We're here to help you. You said you arrived on March the 3rd? Who paid for your ticket? Ancuta. We are cousins. All family. And you take care of everyone's passports? Yeah, yeah. For safety. So many bad people. Do you girls recognise any of these men? Oh, no men. Only girls. If any of you were brought here against your will, if any of you are being forced to work, to do sex work that you don't want to do, we can help you. I'm happy. I'm free. You Irish women, you're too old, too fat, too much complaining. He agrees with me. Don't you, baby? Bag it all up. We'll bring this one home to his wife. The British police are a joke. Passports, now. Blind One. They don't talk to us because they're afraid. Boss, nobody seems remotely afraid of anybody but us. Here. Did you get it? Yeah. Her name is Daniela Corbu. She turned 18 on Monday the 2nd. By Tuesday lunchtime, she was on a plane to Galway - and no, she doesn't want to talk to us. Rachel, come here. Sex slaves? Come on, boss, it's not as if we find these women chained to the radiators. Do you want out? No, I just... I don't know. I go home, I put my baby in the bath, I smell them places on myself, you know? It all just takes so bloody long. You like results. You like arrests, and trials, and long prison sentences. Yeah, I'm a police officer. You get caught with a kilo of cocaine in your car, no question, you're going down for five to ten years minimum. Sounds like my kind of job. You get caught with a trafficked human being, chances are nobody will even notice. She'll be too scared to complain. I'm not having that. Not in my town. Your town, is it? Dougie, have you ever even had a single woman say thank you? One. Scottish gang, that time. She grabbed my leg. "Thank God you're here," she said. One. One is all it takes. One woman brave enough to talk. Any luck? No. The lines are dead now. Our birds have flown. They'll be back... ..and we'll be waiting for them. Come on. Let me go, Luca. Let me go and I won't tell a soul what you did. Funny girl. The people I clean for in London... ..they'll tell someone I'm missing. They will say, "Bloody Eastern Europeans, so ungrateful, "so unreliable, "last time I let any of them clean up my shit." Do money, Blind One. It's OK. It won't be forever. Only don't waste your time thinking anyone is looking for you. Get in the car, bitch. My last client complained because I don't look like my photograph. Ask Ancuta for new ones. I get loads of compliments on mine. But I've never had any... ..and I'm thinking maybe that's because they don't want anyone to recognise me. Anyone to come looking for me. Look, we've got competition. Mm. The one in the middle is pretty. But none of them are smiling. You do more money when you smile. No need to pay rent. They can paint the place, get it ready for my students. Brilliant white. The woodwork, too. Always looks fresh. So, who's first? Well, now. HE INHALES Sweet 16. Did you not hear me say you'll be painting this place in your bare little arses? Clothes. BANGING ON DOOR Go. In there. In there. You'll have your fun later. For what you want, it's 500 euros. Don't touch her face. In there. No, no, no! BANGING ANA SHOUTS AND STRUGGLES, MEN GRUNT Let me see your face. You'll mend. ANA SOBS AND SHIVERS Listen to me. Just don't cross her. Do money for her, do lots of money, and everything will be OK. You are leaving? I can't look after you any more. You call this looking after me? Luca, I'm dying here. Don't leave me with her. Get out, Blind One. Don't think so much about escaping. Think about surviving. Do lots of money and... ..then go home. How much did you get for me? How much?! 30,000 euros. I paid him big money for you. Time to start paying it back. We can't just rescue them. We can't remove an adult woman without her permission, and she won't give it because she has these pimps, violent men who are threatening her family back home. Plus, there's often a very deep level of control, psychological control. At least you do know where these brothels are? For a couple of days at a time, yes, we do. They pop up in Northern Ireland, then they disappear and then they pop up in the Republic. Pop-up brothels? Yes - but can I just say, we abolished slavery in Britain in 1834. Can't say I'd noticed. And back to you, Robin. From the side. Hello, baby. Natalia, will she do rough play? Lower. I'm really looking for someone younger. There'll be three of us. I didn't think she liked me last time. Yes, baby, of course she likes you. Isabella, for the porn star experience. Arse out. She has to like it, you know? Kataryna, the girlfriend experience. She's longing to see you. She was a Kataryna, too. You must know her. Dark hair, about your height. Ukrainian, like you. I'm not Ukrainian. We got very close. Went to dinner, the cinema. She likes rom coms. We were getting engaged. She was bringing her whole family over. And you paid for it all. I loved her. Look again. You must know her. I don't know people. You don't like being kind, do you? The girlfriend experience... ..it's wasted money on you. She's not your girlfriend... ..and neither am I. THEY LAUGH "Timeless romantic allure." I fucking love Italy. Me too. Fucking love it. "Silent, no feelings. "I can't fuck a girl like that. "I want my girls to be lively. "No stars." "No enthusiasm. "Lay there like a block of wood. "One star." "Pretty enough, but she looks like a drug addict, "and her breath smells." My teeth are broken in pieces. "One star." Of course my breath smells. People read these reviews, you know. They are not people, they are arseholes. And I'm glad my breath smells. 30,000 euros? For that? 30,000 euros. I made it back in 13 days. 300 arseholes, in 13 days. I can hardly walk, and you want me to enjoy it? DOOR OPENS I like a quiet life, Blind One. Happy customers, happy money, to send back home to our happy families. These things make me happy. But you... ..always fighting. Always, "No, no, no." "No, no, no." Which is good, actually. Don't tell me this is news for the Blind One. Don't tell me she doesn't know why they love her so. Why she does so much money. Everybody wants the one who likes to be raped. Stupid blind fucking bitch! Do you want to work for me, or not?! Come on, Blind One. Let me explain. I look after you. I protect you. From the police, immigration, the others. Or I leave you here alone, in the middle of nowhere. I will ask you just once more. Do you want to work for me? Do you want to do money for me? Or would you prefer to die like a dog in the middle of the road? So that your poor mama will never know what happened to her baby. HORN HONKS Never mind. You've got us. Funny, Blind One. Look at yourself, sat here with us... ..among all the straight people. All the straight people, all looking straight through us. I cannot see them. Of course you can. My glasses. Now are you going to say I never give you anything? She loves me now, look. Look at all the stupid women. No idea what their husbands get up to behind their backs. They are blind. No. You and me, baby... ..we are invisible. They're clearly all free agents. This company insists that all girls provide verification shots. All that proves is she knows how to hold up a piece of cardboard. On the contrary. It's clear evidence she knows what she's doing. We suspect some of the women advertised on your website have been trafficked. No, no. All our employers operate legitimately. All the girls that use our service are free, willing, and volunteers. Anything else is bad for business. Ionut Ilie and Ancuta Schwarz. Members of an organised crime group from Romania. No-one here has any contact with individual advertisers. I mean to get a court order, requiring you to release all financial transactions between these individuals. My pleasure. Free movement of labour, eh? Anything else is bad for business. You girls will be busy this week, with the Downpatrick Races on. Oh, er, my horse came in at 16-1. I bought you something with my winnings, Natalia. Huh? Oh, well, never mind. Give us a wee kiss, huh? See you soon. Yes. Soon, Declan. What? I can do some of that. Take the burden off Ancuta. PHONE RINGS Try it. Always answer the same. "Baby, baby, baby." Hello, baby. Hey, can we book an hour with Lucy? Lucy. She's so pretty. There'll be three of us. No problem, baby. Good. Will text you the address, baby. Yes. Bye-bye. She needs more names and more profiles. They all need more profiles. Nobody is doing enough money. Get it done while I'm in Sweden. Don't ever let me catch you looking at my man. PHONE RINGS Go on. Hello, baby. I want to book Melanie... ..and Sabrina... OK, baby. ..and Rica, and Liv and Yasmin. Yeah, all at once. That's maybe not possible as they are all busy girls. You then, you come? It's 200 for her. Aye, no bother. Your first outcall. Where are you, baby? Nice. I smell money. Hello, baby. Here is Conchita. Well, this is grand. Come in. Oh! Look, look, every one a perfect gentleman. So... Then the price is more. Is this enough? You have fun with these boys. Just checking you're not wearing a wire. Paranoid, I know. Take a seat. Fancy a beer? So, Conchita. You answer the phones, but it's not your business, right? You work for pimps? And you're not... you're not Spanish, not really? I'm guessing Romanian? You're a policeman? You ever seen police with one of these wee things round his leg? Huh? If he goes out past midnight, he goes up in smoke! It's part of his bail conditions. You are criminals? Not criminals either. Your man there's just daft enough to keep getting caught. Tae fuck. I don't do drugs. Do you do taking your clothes off? What the fuck happened to you? Put your clothes back on. Look, we could help you. Our friends are very interested in your business. I am the product for sale, here, not the manager. Our friends want to know what the fuck your business is doing in our town. You know, the people you're talking about would not agree that this is your town. They would say that it is their town now. "Conchita: brunette. "Anal without, deep throat, "there's nothing she won't do for fun." Look, you can go upmarket. Yeah? Girls in beautiful dresses, fancy restaurants, wealthy clients. You don't have to suffer like this. If the pimps find out about this conversation, I will suffer more than you can possibly imagine. What's your real name? Conchita. OK. Conchita. PHONE RINGS Yes, Liam? Boss, on the Romanian job, the mobile phones have moved from Irish to UK codes, and the website kindly confirms that both pages were paid for on the same credit card. In Ionut Ilie's name? Yep. Good. Now we follow the money. Sorry I'm late, chaps. No worries. Eyes down, never draw attention to yourself. Every hotel, the same rules. Here is Isabella. There's your hundred. You two have fun now. It's a nice room. So, what do you want? Just to talk. Hold on, all right, I've paid my money, I just want to talk. Have you got a daughter? Go home, arsehole. And when you look at her, think of me. Marked notes handed over. You OK? Just took me by surprise, that's all. Was she scared? She was angry. Targets are leaving the hotel. Copy that. That was quick. Walking east on Derry Street. Roger that. The others love to steal our money. Police love to find it. So whenever it's busy, you need to send someone down here every couple of hours, with protection. Why are you telling me all this? Ionut is expanding into Scandinavia. So, one day, Blind One, you could be just like me. Go on, pay it in. Cashier number one, please. Hi, there. Thank you. Hold it. Now we send a picture to Ionut, to prove we sent him the money. So that's more than Â£100,000. Yeah. All via money exchanges in Belfast, Dublin, Galway, Cork, and Stockholm. All registered to the same IP address. That IP address belongs to Mr Ionut Ilie. Who flew, this morning to... Stockholm. Just when you think you're getting close. I'll speak to the Swedish boys. And here's Daniela putting money into various Italian branches, five years ago. When she'll only have been 13. When I was little, I wanted to grow up to be a princess. One day, I'm going to have a little house in the forest. Where I can have dogs... ..and chickens... ..and live there with my boyfriend. I know you still think he's coming for you. He did this to prove I'm his little star. He branded you. Be kind, Ana. I'll get you out of here, one day. I'm going to Sweden. You could come, too. An alert from the airline. She's in seat 33C. Estimated arrival 2:15 Stockholm time. They never just run. So what's she doing there? 22 minutes from arriving alone in Stockholm to picking up her first booking. Maybe Swedish police can get a statement out of her. The pimps allow her to travel round Europe on her own. She's obediently going about her work for them, on her own. She could walk away, but she doesn't. That's how deep the control gets. This one's never going to talk. PHONE RINGS Answer that. Hello, baby. Natalia? Is that you? It's Declan. Declan, baby. We don't see enough of you. Well, you're in luck. I'm in Belfast today. An outcall? Eh? Of course, why not? What, oh, oh, you mean like a hotel? Yes, that will be lovely. I'll be there in five. I have an outcall. Oh, wow. Glasses. It's a look! Drive. All right. ON RADIO: Wagon Wheel by Nathan Carter So, will we get that hotel? I mean, it's going to have to be a cheap one, though. I'm not going to a hotel. Will I just take you back now? I'm not going back. Ah, you can't really want to give all this up? All the fun, and the money? I mean, everything I earn, I'm spending on you - and that's just me. I don't get your money. I don't get anybody's money. The pimps keep it all - and what was the other word you used? All right, don't kick off! Fun?! Fun?! All right! It's quite nice just sitting here. It's quite nice just having a wee drive together, in the sunshine. So rock me momma like a wagon wheel Rock me momma any way you feel Hey... # PHONE RINGS I'm just driving here, so... IONUT: Bring her back, little man, or I'll tell your mummy you're a pervert. HANGS UP You can stay here for the night. Look, it's all very well you dumping yourself on me... ..but they're threatening to tell my family. They only have your phone number, they cannot find out where you live. Well, that's easy for you to say. My mum will kill me if she finds out. Look, you'll be safe in here. Sleep in my mum's car. She has a dog blanket in the back. If it was so bad, why did you never just leave? I was too scared... ..and they make you believe it's all you are good for. Come on. I must've been mad to bring you here. What if... What if you take me into town and we get a hotel? I don't have money for hotels. A flat, though, a flat would be better. A flat would pay for itself. A fancy one, and you working out of it. Think of the money we'd make, huh? I mean, what else are you any good for, huh? Get in the fucking car! I can take her back to Romania, I might still get good money for her. She's past her best. If nobody wants to buy her, then the obvious destination is Dubai. They love girls like her over there... ..for a little while. Dubai, where old whores go to die. DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS APPROACH This woman is no good to me, Stefan, she is a monster. Oy. I'm telling you, it's what a lot of men want. Got all the gear, look. Turn around. OK. Go back. Go. Deal. She's a good one, no? Should definitely do good money. Come here. Put another one. Come here! THEY CHATTER IN ROMANIAN: DOOR BUZZES DOOR BUZZES Hello? Buzz me in. DECLAN: What else are you any good for? ANCUTA: You've got us. IONUT: Would you prefer to die like a dog in the middle of the road? SEAN: What the fuck happened to you? POLICEWOMAN: Have you no shame? SKINNY: One day, Blind One, you take pictures like me. I'm going to Sweden. LILY: They all want it to hurt. IONUT: Everybody wants the one who likes to be raped. SEAN: You don't have to suffer like this. LIVELY CHATTER AND LAUGHTER Remember me? What the fuck are you doing here? You all right? Sure, come on. Just in time for the party! Come on, come in, come in. LOUD ELECTRONIC MUSIC I couldn't think of anywhere else to go. You're grand. All right. Hey, come on, come on in. Get yourself a wee drink there. Can I call my mother, please? Uh, yeah. Keep it. I've got loads more. My name is Ana. Nice to meet you, Ana. HANGS UP DOOR RATTLES Come on! I hear. She can sleep on the couch. She can make herself useful. Here, do you drive? Really? It's not my fault that you lost your licence. And it's not my fault you keep failing your test. Just fuck off, the pair of you. So, that was about you staying here. If you want to. I don't want to make trouble for you, Sean. What do you want to do? I want to find a safe place. I want to live. I want to be Ana again. Only Ana. Then drive for me. Watch your back. My wife has a theory. You get to see your wife for long enough to listen to a theory? Cheers. Cheers. About why the brothels are busiest on Thursday night. Late night shopping. The minute their wives are out of the house... The men get online. It's gross. So? So, the answer is no. As expected. For God's sake. The prosecutors take the view that our file is not complete. They're not wrong. But all the evidence, the money, the credit cards, the accounts, we've got it all. Yeah, except a witness statement. Cheers. SEAN: All right, let's go, lads! Look at me. All right, dopey fuck. Get the fuck out of here! We're on your side. All right, get them out of the fucking van, aye. Get the fuck out! You're a fucking creep! Shut your fucking mouth! You dirty bastard! Don't shoot! They're little girls. Fuck off! Your fucking town, is it? Your fucking town?! Ana, wake up. Your man's phone. Thought there might be some useful numbers in there for you. What have you done? Put the world to rights. Don't ask. Have you seen Skinny? Small, pale. Er, the girl I saw was dark. Sean... ..I never want to have sex with anyone again. No problem. I'll make us a cup. PHONE RINGS MAN ON PHONE: Hey, Sean, can you sort us out? All right, I can be there in ten. I'm thinking coffee. As usual. I'm thinking toast. As usual. Come on, Sean, don't mess me about. I'm here. What the fuck? Wind your neck in. POLICE SIREN Sean? Fuck. Phones. Not allowed phone on bail conditions. Hello, again, Sean. Lovely evening. Hands on the car. Hmm? Hands on the car. I'm arresting you for breaching bail by using a mobile phone. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you fail to mention when questioned something you later rely on in court. Right. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. All right, for fuck's sake. Fuck. ANA: Do you know how it is to be alone? Really alone? When you finally know for sure that nobody's coming. Nobody ever will. Do you know what that does to you? It makes you grow up. Ana? Thanks for calling us. I just want... They have a girl. A slave. So young, so small. A star, branded here, on her wrist. They call her Skinny, but her name is Daniela. You saw her. You saw her the day you came, saw, left and did nothing. Is she in Sweden? Erm, we can't give you that information, I'm sorry. So, you tell me nothing and want me to tell you everything? Ana. This belongs to a man from my country called Ionut Ilie. All his contacts... ..all his history. We can put him behind bars if you help us. Ana, you were brave enough to come here. You're brave enough to tell your story. But I'm not brave. I'm terrified. Because they will come back for me, and you will still do nothing. People need to know this story. We are everywhere. People only have to look. Do it for the other women, then. Do it for Daniela. I'll tell you my story. I'll tell anyone who will listen. Then let's see if it changes anything.
