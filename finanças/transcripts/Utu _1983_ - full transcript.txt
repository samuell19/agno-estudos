Company, right, right! Left! Left, right, left! Left! Left, right, left! Attack! You took your time. We got lost. Where are we? It's all right. This is my country. We among friends. Ngai Maramara. The others are about a day ahead. Unless they too got lost. Let's go! Te Wheke, these men from the city are spooked by the mist. Hold your fire! There's only one of them! We got him. Did we? Sword wounds. A friend of yours? No. Not my friend. My uncle. Ngai Maramara? Why? They're our friends. The Pakeha told us many things. I'm on your side! Wrong color. Tell the Colonel I will catch up with him sooner or later. I must kill the white man to avenge what he has done. The spirits of my people command me. I can not live this life! I would rather die. Everybody quite still please. Thank you. Good. Good. That'll be all. Excellent. Thank you, Mr. Nicholas. Well? What do you want? - Lieutenant James Scott reporting, sir. - Too late, the war is over. British army's gone home. My orders, sir. - The War Office - Sir, I've been ordered to experiment with some new tactics. Commando group, sir. It's a concept I saw in South Africa. The Boers using it to repress the natives. Small groups of men surprising the enem... Yes, well you've a lot to learn about this country. I was born here, sir. - Really? - Yes, sir. So you're a colonial, Mr. Scott. A colonial. The Gospel according to Saint Matthew, chapter 26, verses 51 and 52. "And behold... "one of them which were with Jesus, "stretched out his hand and drew his sword, "and struck the servant of the high priest, "and smote off his ear. "And said Jesus unto him: "Put up again thy sword into his place. "For all they that take the sword "shall perish with the sword." "All they that take the sword, "shall perish with the sword." Even as we are gathered here the foul messengers of Satan are at loose in this land. Satan, who goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. His messengers, who persist in their heathen blindness, these defilers of women. These murderers, following false prophets into the eternal fire of damnation. Creep about through this land, amongst its dark places and secret corners. A land upon which God hath lavished with beauty and all the wealth of nature. A land indeed where every prospect can exist. But let us take heart. The enemies of God shall not prosper. The day of reckoning for all who take up arms against the servants of the one true God is never long delayed. For God Himself has told us all they that take the sword shall perish ... by the sword! This is the God's house! I am one of God's children. Would I give you a loaded gun? Of course I would. He who lives by the sword, shall die by the sword. God's promise not his threat. If we live like rats in the ferns of the forest floor, then so shall we die in the fire that burns them A fire lit by the White Man's lust for our land and fanned by the breath of Pakeha's words of God. Is it the Lord's plan? Perhaps the vicar has other masters than God. What other choice does the Lord offer a warrior? Imagine... Imagine if you aside your swords, but not too far aside. Imagine you took up the plow, took on the guise of farmers, traders, but were always ready. Could we put ten thousand warriors on the streets of Auckland, for just a few hours? Wait. Be ready. A present for you! It's beautiful. It's yours. No, come on... Scared of it? Should I be? If the lizard smiles at you, death is not far away. He says he's home in the wilderness and that he is my protector. Yes, Willie. See you soon, my friend. Come on, move along! Hurry up! Alright, you over there ride with the first wagon. Stick with the wagon! Emily... Emily, what are you doing? Jonathan, you shouldn't have your boots on in here. There's shutters to be closed, ammunition to be checked, and more... - You said there's no danger - There's no danger. The military panicking, as usual. They'd have done better to lend us two riflemen. Three times now, we've been locked up in their bloody stock house. Three times now we've lost animals. And it wasn't to no Maori rebels. Well what if they do come? And this. It's beautiful. It's yours. Jonathan! I love you. And I you. Go on, shut the shutters. Maybe I should put a sign at the gate. "Rebels keep out!" No, none of you can read. I can. Well, not too good. Shame about the good reverend, he was sincere enough. Though I can understand it happening. He was a fanatic. He had lost head well before Te Wheke got to him. Why are we here? Are we here to build monuments to civilization or to tear them down? Well this one's falling down. You do your work, woman. I'll do mine. If you fix the pantry door, then I check the supplies. And if you could fix the water, then I wouldn't have to slog across to the confounded pump. And while you're at it the railing on the upstairs balcony needs fixing. Jonathan! It's him! Ah, Te Wheke! And what does the Octopus want from us? I want your guns and ammunition. And do you think I'll just give them to you? No. Get out of my land, then, or I'll shoot you down. He says it's his land! Pass me another box of cartridges! What have you done with them? The shed. - How many have you got? - Ten! -Try to keep their heads down, I'll go and get them! -Jonathan! Bloody hell! Lord, have mercy. Hold fire! I'll talk to the white woman. The one in the shed, don't let him escape. Jump, Emily! They must have been expecting us. Left! Left, right, left! Right, right! It's American. Very new. A Spencer repeating carbine. A present, actually. It was given to me for saving a young boy's life in England. Fire! I dragged him out of a river and his grateful father turned out to be an Earl. Just like the Colonel? Yes, quite. But no, not actually. He was nothing like him, he's quite a decent chap. Fire! It was sent to me in South Africa. Much coveted weapon. When the Boers get weapons like this, then they just haven't got a chance. With this, one man can defeat ten. That depends on how far away those ten men are, sir. Maori have a strange sense of humor. I was over at the Arawa camp the other night. They were celebrating the fact that Te Wheke seems to be on the run. Here. Sitting around the fire, songs, drinks, telling stories. The one called Moses, do you know him? He told a story which they all found hilariously funny. They were consumed with mirth. It wasn't at all funny. Quite the opposite. Well evidently some Maoris captured a Taranaki village. And drove out the British. And in it they found a native barrel of picked pork left behind. But they also discovered a couple of fresh graves from which they got the corpses of two Pakeha soldiers. Here. They diced them, and peeled them, and put them into the barrel, and despite the strong strategic position of the village, they evacuated so the British could recapture the pork. Pork in brine! What's so funny? Here. I'll take it. I think I'll fish downstream a bit And the fish will be weak with laughter and in front passed you. And they'll be easier to catch. Do count your fishes before they catched. Is that a Pakeha joke? Funny sense of humor, you Pakehas. Stop! Stop her! Henare! Stop that girl! She's got my gun! It's loaded! Where are you? Are you alright? It's just a graze. Are you chasing me or not? I lost my knife. Mr. Williamson! So these are the troops that will humble the mighty Te Wheke. - He went that way about a week ago. - We'll get him. He may be hiding amongst them. How can you tell they're not his men? I can tell. How can we tell you're not one of them? You can't. Don't you worry about us, Mr. Williamson. We'll get Te Wheke. Not with that lot you won't, boyo. Where the hell is he? Maybe it's easier for Te Wheke to hide from us, than for us to hide from Te Wheke. I must say Mr. Scott, I deplore your maverick approach. All very novel, perhaps, but, oh dear. "Small groups of rangers surprising the enemy." - I shudder to think where that might lead us. - Yes sir, I just tho… Nevertheless, I have looked into your proposal with some care, this commando business. The War Office endorses it, I dare say it's worth a trial. Thank you, sir! But... I have also, for the record, written to London to explain that should anything happen to you, while experimenting with these new tactics, that would be unfortunate. But it would be the War Office's entire responsibility, not mine. I just thought you should know that. Thank you, sir! Not at all, Mr. Scott. Not at all. All right you scruffy lots! Atten-tion! Present, arms! Kura! Henare! Aren you chasing me or not? Kura is gone. So has her family. They've gone to join Te Wheke. Does he want them? Why do we fight, tribe against tribe? And always Pakeha sides with those who best advance his cause. And we still face each other across battle lines in one hundred years? Then stop! Tomorrow. Mr. Scott gave me his hat. Tomorrow he can have it back. I won't need it anymore. Trouble? Maybe. Is he going too? Take cover! Cease fire! They left! You were dead right. It will never stop. Henare is dead, and you stuff yourself with Pakeha potatoes? Were they harvested from our confiscated lands? Or could they be your reward for exterminating our people? Eat shit. Have you read this? I can't read. I have no time for Pakeha trickery which turns you from the truth! I'm going to join Te Wheke. I will kill the Pakeha... Indeed, you bastards will be consumed in a fire of your own making. Did you hear what he said? He can't read. Colonel Elliott. "Lieutenant James Scott. “Your recent failure under fire has forced me to return to our proven tactics. "The War Office has of course been notified. “You are removed from active duty until you are fully recovered. "Your papers recommending your promotion are to be held until further notice. "I shall personally take command in the field and ..." Anything else? Where are you going, friend? To Te Wheke. What makes you think Te Wheke wants you? That's the second time I've shot that man, and he still lives. It doesn't matter if you knew or not, he followed you, you led him. They already have too many. We've become too easy to find. The Pakeha can drag his army through these mountains I would rather my army stayed out there, unknown. Something wicked this way comes. Do you like our new headquarters? Built some years ago by Te Wheke himself. From here we could range the whole district. We've captured or killed quite a few of his sympathizers. How can you tell which ones are sympathizers? That's simple. They're the brown ones lying on the ground, they're not moving, and they've got the flies around them. I have a task for you, nothing too strenuous. Got a prisoner upstairs. Very dangerous. Shot two of our men during a sneak raid on the armory. Due for trial and execution in the morning. Do you suppose you might contrive to keep awake for 4 or 5 hours? You can handle a gun, I take it? Yes, sir. Good lad. Your prisoner. Constable, duty calls. We leave you, sir, to the call of yours. Stiff upper lip, Scott. Don't drop off now. Sergeant! Get the men together, I want to leave as soon as possible. So I'm to spend the last night of my life with you? It could be worse. Could it? - Don't you like me. - Yes, of course I do. Don't you find me attractive? That's good. I used to play here when I was small. Think of all the things we could get up to. I could try to escape, would fight. ButI'm strong, and you're still hurt from your wound. And I'd go for that. Biting and punching you. So there's a good chance I'd get past you. You'd have to shoot me. In the back. Why don't you just let me go. I don't want to die, Mr. Scott. I don't want you to die either. You don't? That's that, then. Kura... Stop! Stop Kura! Or I'll shoot you dead! It's not much of a threat, you understand. I'm going to die anyway. I have no choice. Look, if I don't let you go, they'll kill you. Amongst other things. And if I do let you go, then I stand to lose everything. My commission, my career... I'll be finished! What's the bucket for? The bucket? Ah, the bucket... Oh, the prisoners use it. It's for… calls of nature. Calls of nature? We could make love. And then, you could let me go. Or shoot me. Or come with me. What do you say? It's tempting. I could be your slave, doing whatever you wanted to, until you get bored of me. No hurry. What's wrong? How did you say it? The cry of nature? Ah, the bucket! Oh yes, of course! Excuse me. This is a terrible business, this war. We all find our sympathies confused. I mean, look at the situation I'm in now. They'll be back soon. In fact, they're somewhere down there now. What am I to do? All right. I'll do it. I'll go with you. What do you say? Gone. Hello, Mr. Scott. Wiremu! I hear you've been letting prisoners escape? That's no way to make it to Captain. I think my ambition escaped with the prisoner. Now I am part of Napoleon's retreat. The Colonel is worried, sir. Te Wheke's mana is growing. If he should win a major victory, then those who were thought to be defeated in the war may well rise again to drive the Pakehas back into the sea. Elliott believes that? Yes. How can he? Because I told him so. Which side are you on, Wiremu? The same side as you, sir. I was born here too. There are hundreds of them. We must have them worried. That's one way of looking at it. They're heading north. They march to Te Puna. The Colonel will want a bath. Company, halt! Rogers. Captain Rogers! Ah Rogers, you can move your men on into the valley, I shall set up headquarters here at Te Puna. I shall join you, if necessary, when the rest of our forces arrive. You and your commandos, Mr. Scott, will stay here with me on picket duty, If that's what you want, sir. I hardly think you need question my tactics, Lieutenant. With luck, we should arrive in good time to pick up the pieces of Lance Corporal Te Wheke. Sir! This is Captain Stuart's detachment. Who on earth is that in front? Williamson, sir. With some idiotic weapon. Evidently, he's quite mad. So it seems. Make sure he doesn't get in the way, Mr. Scott. - James! - Sir? Lay out my uniform for dinner and prime my bath. Government troops, hundreds of them. Aye, it's a big fat army down there, but you know? It's such a small head. Morning, Colonel! Such a small head... Your neck is safe until tomorrow, Colonel. Then their big fat army will run around with it's head chopped off. Hello you two! Nice to see you on such a fine day! Hey, what's that? It's a Maori! Hey! Fellas seen Te Wheke? - Why? - Cause he's right behind you. Hold it! I am a Pakeha. Is that so? Maybe. You just remember what you are when you lead the attack on that hotel. Might have been a Pakeha for one minute and already hate you Maori. Strange, Mr. Scott, that you, a specialist in tactics, should play such an indifferent game. Whereas Wiremu here, an aboriginal native of Aotearoa, plays rather... Check. Shit. It's a world war. You speak French? Haven't been to France, have you? I speak English, I've never been to England. Yes. Mr. Scott? No thank you, sir. Yes, I know. Still, we should have something decent to drink when the supply wagon arrives. Your finger is in my glass. Your finger is in my glass! Get out! Wait for me upstairs! Pity! You were doing so well. Mate in three, sir. It doesn't matter how long it takes us to get into position, but once the men on the wagon blow that front door open, we move! Everyone together! The explosion is the signal. Once inside... Go! Burn them wood. Don't do that! Go to bed. I have no bed. Go sleep in a butcher's shop, on the sawdust. He's not there! Who? Te Wheke. Who is it? Williamson! Sorry, no one's allowed in after half past nine. I have to see the Colonel, urgently! Come on now! Alright, alright. - Bugger, who is it? - Williamson! What in hell's name do you want? Te Wheke! What? He's out there! - Where? - Out there! - Fart off, Williamson, for God's sake. - I can smell him. That's quite possibly. Call me when you actually see him, all right? Confounded lunatic! Get up. How'd you get in? Same way as you're leaving. Move! I can see your bum. What are you doing? Taking my jacket off. Hurry! Time to get going! They're waiting for us! What's that? Push off. Over there! And there! The manuka. Manuka ... And there. You are crazy. Push off. Manuka... Who's there? Elliott! I've seen Te Wheke. - What? - I've seen him! I don't like that madman. Mr. Elliott! I've sen him! - What? - I've seenTe Wheke's men! Hurry up man! Let me in and I'll show you! I've seen him! - Are you sure? - It's him I tell you, out there. I saw the manuka bushes moving. Where? There! It's Te Wheke. That scrub were there yesterday and it's not manuka, it's matagouri. Matagouri, are you sure? Go on, just go to bed will you. Doesn't matagouri have spikes? The madman thinks he's seen us. - There is no matagouri on the north island. - It's all right. It's nothing. You can go back to bed. And don't you let him in again. What's that, then? The supply wagon. - It's late! - Go to bed, Williamson! I have to go back soon. Before it gets light. But didn't you say your gun can fire seven times without stopping? That's true. You're late! They don't look too well, those poor lads. You are here! Attack! You knew! Yes, I knew. Of course, I knew. Around to the back! We must get inside or we're finished! They seem to be everywhere! We've walked into a trap! They knew we were coming! Run for it! Run for it! So, he would catch up with me sooner or later. Well he did, and I beat him. Smashed him! Sent him away with his tail between the legs, this Lance Corporal Te Wheke, deserter. Tomorrow, with my full force, I shall pursue him relentlessly and crush him. And any other rebellious brown bastard! - Stop it! - Silence! There are men torn, bleeding, dying out there. There will be more if you don't stop it now. You have the power to finish it. You're mad. Sometimes I'm mad. By tomorrow night he'll be in the heart of the mountain country. - We'll never find him. - He's finished. But he still lives. Somebody has to do it. Aye, sometimes I'm mad. Sometimes I'm not. Get the men ready! We have to go as far as possible before dark! Take everything with you! Are you coming with us or do you have to bury yourself too? Is this your plan for us? All right men, we're on foot from here on. James, take care of the horse, will you. Come on, get a move on! A grave. They're half a day ahead. I was only trying to save your life, I owe it to you! What is it? Nothing, I... Must be the mist... - Smoke? - Maybe. Te Wheke. Too careless. He be counting on the main party instead of us, sir. They're about two days behind, and we've made good time. So he'd feel safe enough. About 8 hours up the valley. Manaaki. I know the place. And what chance do you suppose we have of getting any closer? If we move slowly and carefully, before sunset, sir. That'll do nicely. Break camp! Up there, sir. - That's impossible! - Really ragged. With women, children, wounded? You know a better way, sir? Ready, sir. How the hell did he get here? The dogs can't hear him, and surely they can smell him. We're downwind. Then they'll smell Elliott's perfume. Elliott? No, Scott. Shh! Te Wheke! Not yet. Elliott is to the south. When he attacks, they'll turn their backs. And we surprise them. And they'll escape across the creek over there somewhere. We only want one of them. Get them! Keep down old girl. Keep down. Has fate decided his time has come? Aye. Exactly. What was that? I said they just got Elliott. It's getting dark! The night will hide us! Fall back! They're running! After them! Matu! Kura is here? Where's Te Wheke? Thanks. I'm gonna chop this bastard in half! No! Mr. Scott said no. Is Kura here? Where is she? This court finds you, Manatiki Te Wheke, guilty on the following counts. Desertion. The murder of the Reverend Johns at Opoho on 17th January 1870. Murder of Emily Williamson at Williamstown on 23rd January 1870. Organization and participation in the raid on Te Puna, resulting in the death of two British soldiers and three civilians. Murder of a British officer, Colonel Elliott. There are many other charges which could be brought. These, however, are sufficient. I therefore sentence you to be executed by firing squad, on this evening, 27th August 1870. May the Lord have mercy on your soul. Can the prisoner speak English? Who is this Lord who will have mercy on me? Is it a God who presides over this court? I thought this court was presided over by a fat German woman on distant shores. And whose interest, does this court represent? Not mine. Not yours either. No way. Of course I'm guilty, I am. But I feel no guilt. I felt more guilty when I fought for the Crown. I took up arms against the Pakeha because I could no longer believe in Pakeha justice. So, shoot me. But don't talk of justice or mercy, because it's not here. He sings... like a bird. He speaks with big words, but he acts like a dog! You don't need a firing squad to shoot a dog, it only takes one bullet. This is a military court of law. I have watched this man murder my cousin. I have seen him beat my niece to death. I have seen you destroy my family. For you, this is a court of military law. For me, it is blood for blood. Utu! Would you like to be my executioner? Who else? Who else, indeed? This is a military court of law, you are... Drop your weapons or I'll blow the Lieutenant's head off! Took up the musket to answer the death of your family, the destruction of your home. Me too! My wife's murderer sits before me. So I must... kill him. If I don't kill him I'm fear this military court will burble all night until I let you go. It likely will. Another time, maybe, my friend. Enough of this! I am the senior officer here. Where is she? They knew we were coming! You told them! You told them! I am without prejudice. I'll shoot him myself. You... You would pay off this account with Te Wheke with a bullet in his head? And then, what? What are you counting on? You are just a woman. From a different tribe. For you to settle this affair is to create new conflict. And you, who claim Utu for the death of your wife, yet it was you who refused military protection. And what is Te Wheke's life worth? He has been condemned, he will die anyway. That is why you can't shoot him. And you, sir, you say you are without prejudice. Yet this man has twice wounded you. Does this not color your opinion? Besides, I think Pakehas have killed enough Maori, and Maori, have killed enough Pakeha. I am a Corporal in the militia. I have standing in this court. And my mana is of this earth. Just like Te Wheke. I have no desire for Utu, no ledger to balance. I am without prejudice. My name... is Wiremu... Manaweka... Te Wheke. This is my brother. Look at this gun made in America. This gun was gifted to this officer by a high-born Pakeha, as a reward for saving the life of his son. If I squeeze the trigger a lightning flash will render the heavens asunder and the very earth will shake beneath your feet! When this gun fires its reverberations will be felt in the most distant heavens. This weapon is imbued with the spirit and there's no greater gun in existence. Here. Take hold of it. Bang! And who is this man, that each time I shoot him, he still lives? When you get to heaven prepare a place for me. Do you think they'll approve of me? Of course they will. You have earned your place there. Hurry. Utu Redux is dedicated to the memory of David Carson-Parker and Mike Hopkins Subtitles: Eric Leblanc Subtitle: HIVENTY
