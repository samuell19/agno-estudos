Don't look at me like that. There were times the sun rose and set only for me. The birds sang only to make me happy. The rivers flowed towards me, and the grass grew so l could play in it. l was a prince. Actually, why just a prince? l was a king. And the whole world around me was my kingdom. From the moment l opened my eyes and learned to walk l started to run around and poke my nose everywhere. You can always find something good. And if you do, it's best to hide it before someone else takes it away. That's why you should wake up first and scout out the territory. That way you can grab a good spot to wait for Mother and be the first to grab a teat before your brothers wake up. With a lot of pups and fewerteats, whoeverdidn't grab one in time simply didn't get any milk. That's something that l learned early on and l'll neverforget, if you don't look out for yourself you'll end up hungry. And anotherthing l learned: lnstead of fighting for milk it's best to be ready to jump forthe meat. Father brought it from the hill in his belly and vomited it onto the ground. lt may sound kind of gross, but it tasted divine. Fatherdidn't always feel like dealing with us. The angrier he got, the more we wanted to go to him. Although no one had a chance. That is... no one but me. Father had a problem with his front leg but that didn't stop him from hunting for us. One day instead of giving us meat he made us follow him. l was disappointed that he didn't bring any food but l gradually realized that something new and interesting was happening. We left our protected canyon forthe first time and climbed the hill to... Actually, l had no idea to what. l didn't even know there was anything outside the canyon. The fartherwe went, the more curious l was. ln the end l couldn't hold back. l left the pack and went on alone. ln an instant the whole world changed. l couldn't believe my eyes. lt was a thousand times more than anything l'd everseen. l wasn't even sure it was real. My brothers had already gone back but l didn't care. l wanted to run to that amazing new place... Actually, l didn't want to, l had to! l felt it inside. Fathertried to call me, but he saw that l simply couldn't move. l was stuck. On one hand l was irresistibly drawn there, on the other hand l felt my body couldn't do it yet. l had no choice but to wait a while. But with every day that passed my yearning only grew to explore those spaces, and as soon as my body was big enough l set out. No matter how far l ran there was no end to it. Not before me, not behind, not to the sides... Just more and more freedom in every direction. The farther l went, the stronger l felt, the fartheraway l got, the more l loved the wide open spaces. l was as happy as can be. Suddenly l saw the animals with horns that l'd seen from the hill. l wanted to leap with them through the tall grass, it looked like such fun, but theirscent drove me wild and suddenly all l wanted to do was eat them. But they had other ideas. Maybe l wasn't quiet enough? Maybe l wasn't quick enough? Where's Father when you need him? l was hungry, so hungry... l'd neverfelt so hungry before. And then l smelled the wonderful meat that Father used to bring us. But l was surprised by theirsize and their look wasn't too encouraging. How could l get a little piece of that? l didn't know what l wanted more, to fill the hole in my belly orto prove l could beat them. What l discovered was, one wolf alone doesn't make fairteams. And as if that weren't enough, suddenly my way was blocked by those lines. What is that? l couldn't keep going. This was too much. l had to satisfy my belly and my sense of dignity somehow. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to leave the pack. Everything was a little more complicated than l thought. Little did l know that it would only get more complicated. The changes caught me unprepared. l couldn't figure out where the sun went orwhat all that soft whiteness was, but it froze my paws and made it hard to move, not to mention catch something to eat. Everything slowed down. l looked at the otheranimals and thought about my brothers who were probably huddling together to keep warm. Don't believe what they say. Who wants to be a lone wolf anyway? And again those lines that block the way and the food... Who put them there? Finally the sun came back along with the sounds l'd got used to hearing, and the animals l'd got to know. Renewal was in the air and that brought back memories of home. Maybe my parents also had new babies after l left. Little brothers who l don't even know. l felt full and gave up on eating it. So ljust sat there and watched it. But then came new noises, louder, uglier, scarier noises than l'd ever heard before. What kind of animal makes that kind of noise? l didn't know whetherto run away like everyone else orwait. lf his mother left him there, maybe l should stay, too? l saw her look for him and not find him. You could say l was worried about him. Strange as it seems, l was glad to see that he was all right. lt seemed like the danger had passed. But then l noticed that the animal left something behind and that something was growing at a frightening rate. The heat became unbearable, l had to find a way to cool off. And then l saw her. l couldn't take my eyes off her. lt was love at first sight. Suddenly everything was different. l didn't want to run in the fields any more, orclimb hills, or prove myself to the cows ortake overthe world... all l wanted was her. The earth felt different, the wind, even the waterseemed clearer, as if the world had suddenly changed colorand shape. Everything became fun, and not only that, l didn't have to make do with hyraxes any more. Now we'll show those cows. Two wolves is a totally different story. Although it was the first time we ever hunted together it felt like we'd been doing it forever. But let's not get carried away. Friends are one thing but meat is another. l'm the male and l always eat first. One summer morning l went out wandering, l sniffed the grass, made paths among the flowers, and then fell asleep unworriedly in the sunshine. But then those noises came again, louderand closer, and everyone ran away again. l didn't know what to do so l hid and looked around. The animal was dragging a deer, two, three... many more than l could count. How did it catch so many so fast? How big is its pack that it needs so much food? What if it decides to hunt me? And her? Where is she, anyway? l was surprised at the way l felt. l'd never been so worried about anyone but myself before. The days passed and things started to overflow. l felt something big was about to happen. lt was in the air, in the water, it was everywhere. Suddenly herscent began to confuse me and excite my body in a way l'd neverfelt before and l became restless. l didn't know why, but l had to be near her, to touch her, to smell her. She drove me wild but l couldn't stop. And then l discovered that we weren't alone. Suddenly everyone wanted her. Herscent drove everyone wild, but she was mine! What are they doing here anyway? l had to get rid of them to prove who's the boss here. To make it clear that only one can have her and that one is me. But they didn't give up. They finally got the point and went off to find anothershe-wolf. l'd nevergiven up on anything and l didn't intend to start then. Now she knows it too. lt felt like one thing has ended and something new was about to begin. l didn't know exactly what, but l felt it was going to be good. With every moment that passed l only loved her more. And even though l'm a male and everything l found myself giving in to her and letting hereat first. Life is full of endless surprises. She changed before my eyes. She grew heavy and tired and wanted to lie around all day. Everyone around us was so busy, getting ready forsomething, that l started to think l might have a role too. My instincts told me to get to work. She marked the place and l started to prepare it. l saw herstanding there, and waited to see what she would do. l guess she felt the time had come. l realized she didn't want me in there with her, but l didn't know what l was supposed to do. l was hoping she will know. The only thing l could do was stand guard. l heard noises and l felt her pain from afar. l trusted her, but l was also afraid. What was she doing there? What if even she didn't know? lt drove me crazy, not knowing how to help her. l felt herdistress and it overcame me, too. l stood there for hours, worried, but eventually l felt everything was alright. Then l heard the wail of a pup and then another. l'd never imagined that a sound could touch me so deeply. l didn't yet know how many pups there were but l realized l had a pack and l was so filled with pride that l had to tell the whole world! l wasn't used to being away from her forso long and l missed her like crazy. l knew that while the pups were young, only she could catertheir needs, but l didn't feel like sharing her. l wondered how they looked, how they smelled, and l waited forthe moment when she'd let me see them. And then they appeared, each one cuterthan the next, and the next, and the next... We had a lot of pups. One look was all it took to understand what they needed. Milk is nice and sweet and all, but it was time forthe real thing. l went hunting with her like we used to but it wasn't the same any more. The area was full of obstacles and we had to be much fasterand more careful. The biggest change is that we had to eat meat without swallowing it, as my parents did for me. Saving such good meat in my belly forsomeone else... who'd have thought l could do that? The pups grew and we took them out fora hunting lesson. l left them in the bushes with their motherand went ahead. While l looked forsome juicy meat forthem they took the opportunity to have a last dairy meal. ln nature, it's betterto be a wolf than a hyrax. l hoped they noticed how easily l did it. l watched the pups play and wondered about theirfuture, what l should teach them and so on, and l noticed what was happening to the otheranimals around me. l couldn't let that happen to us, so l decided to teach them attack and defense techniques. lt takes a lot of patience to raise puppies. Autumn returned, and with it, the time to see if we could call ourselves "a pack". We went out on a night-hunt together as my parents did with my brothers and me. How many seasons ago was that? lt's hard to count. That was the first time we all did it together. We caught a boar and overcame it easily. The family that hunts together eats together. You could say that from then on l never hunted alone again. When you're the leaderof a pack there are lots of things you don't have to do yourself any more, When time came to get ready for birthing, the olderwolves prepared everything. And me? l only had to supervise. Even though the whole pack was there, l was the only one who was concerned. l knew that something was wrong this time. Very wrong. Every pack has its sad stories, but you have to set them aside and look ahead. We were even bigger than the pack l grew up in but it wasn't really that hard because we hardly had to care forthe pups. The olderwolves did everything. There are days that begin and in yourwildest dreams you can't imagine how they'll end. l should have thought about it before, but l didn't yet understand how to run such a big pack. We went out together, left the little ones in the bushes, and went with the big ones to get food. lt could have been a normal day of hunting but it turned into something entirely different. You can't imagine the pain when you lose an offspring, the anger... l knew which animal was responsible but l didn't know what else it would do. We stood there petrified... How did they find them? Why didn't they stay in the bushes? But there was no time to lose, ln the end, my anger overcame my fear. l felt like everything l'd been through led up to this moment. No animal can take my pups away, l couldn't let it happen. l'll probably nevertruly understand what happened that day but l sure remember how l felt. Only when l saw my pack all together did l realize how lucky we were. But you can't always count on luck. lf you want to survive in this world you have to fight forwhat you have, and that's exactly what l did. Only then could l finally shut my eyes. We enjoyed our life as a family until nature called the olderwolves to go on theirway. The olderwolves began to leave one by one. l knew l had to let them go, just as my parents had let me. The world is too big and fascinating not to go out and explore. l hope l taught them everything they need to know. lt was hard for her but suddenly we had all the time in the world and it felt just like starting over. We could be together without worrying about anyone else and do whateverwe wanted. As faras l was concerned we could go on like that forever. The world gives you so many wonderful things, and sometimes it takes them away, too. But l still have my wonderful memories. The greatest love of all, the thrilling adventures, the splendid pack l raised... A more magnificent dynasty than l'd ever imagined. l took everything l could from life on this earth. And, between you and me... even a little bit more. l trust the wind to say goodbye to them for me.
