Zelda, Zelda... God?! Yes, Zelda, I'm with you. No one believes that you call me. How are you, Zelda? Not good. The cancer is back. Yes, I know. You have to be strong, Zelda. You mustn't give up. I've had enough, I can't take it anymore. What for? - Shame on you for doing this to her. - Do you want her to die?! Stop butting in. I called to tell you that you shouldn't fear death. I went over your file and you're going straight to heaven. We currently don't have any vacancies, so I'd like you to continue the treatments. You still have time. No need to rush. - No vacancies at all? - Hold on, let me check... None! You're still young, Zelda. Continue the treatments. Okay, I'll continue. Your husband sends his regards from heaven. My husband? I'm single. - She's not a widow? - No. Hello? Hello? - Hello? - There's no reception... There's no reception... There's no reception, I'll get back to you. Hello? May I speak to God please? He's in the toilet. - Leave it! - It will take a minute. "Achvat Vatikim Retirement Home" - He needs to be changed. - I already did. - He needs to be changed again. - I did it an hour ago. Change him again. And I want a new patch. No new patch. I just gave him one. - I want a new patch. - No! Are you trying to kill him?! I want a new patch! Does it come out of your mother's pocket? - Calm down... - Does it cost you money? Are you skimping on patches? I can't stand it. You can't abuse a person like that! I'll take him out of here... They finally bloomed, just for you. I'll bring some yellow ones too. - He looks better today. - What are you talking about? That's not your job. How are you, Max? Help me get it over with. He doesn't deserve to live this way. Instead of getting those crazy ideas out of their heads... He needs our support now, giving up is the easiest solution. Don't even think about it. You hear me? What do you want? What are you talking about? Don't pretend, I know you. You'd do anything for him. Are you crazy? What are you doing? I can't take it anymore. I'm going to give him an overdose and end this. - You're not serious?! - I can't see him like this. I see hell in his eyes, you heard him. We'll talk to the doctor tomorrow. He wants to die! You want to talk to the doctor about that? They're keeping him alive as though dying is a crime. - A nation of fools! - Do you want to go to jail? You'll get life sentence. They won't let you see him. Don't cry... Don't cry, sweetheart... It's alright. With today's medicine, who knows what tomorrow will bring. She's doing it for herself, not for him. That's Yana you're talking about. What does he know? He's on morphine. She put that idea into his head. Sunday. Monday. I just took my pills, didn't I? Of course you did. - What day is it? - Sunday. Some genius you are... You and your inventions. Good night. Saturday, Saturday... Monday, Saturday, Wednesday, Sunday... Saturday... "I will give no deadly medicine, nor give any such counsel." He's your friend. I'm a doctor, not an executioner. He's terminal. He can't turn over by himself, he's full of bedsores, he wants to die of old age and they want to hook him up to machines and kill him slowly. Do you realize what you're asking me to do? No doctor would agree to help you. You're so ungrateful. Max loves you so much. You had no problem asking him for money. He did everything for you. He even fixed you up with Geula. And now what is he asking you, to kill him?! What happened to this place? Has everyone gone mad? She comes to me... and that new guy, with the same madness as hers. And I knocked some sense into him and that's exactly what you should do to her. That new guy, what's wrong with him? Nothing. He's perfectly healthy. He wanted to make a deal with me, for a rainy day. Go figure. Terrible. What's his name? Dr. Daniel. What's his first name? Meir. What room is he in? Shame on you. Here, Libby. Libby, take it. I don't want it. It's an omelet, your favorite. When Meme makes a sandwich just for you, you take it. Here. I don't like it. Eat it, it's good. Eat, darling. You're coming, Yehezkel? I'll stay here for a while. Don't forget tonight's lecture. - Come, darling. - Give me a duckie kiss. Let's go. By the time he gets here, Max will be dead. I want my Max to fall asleep without suffering. I'm very flattered that you came to me. Think about it and let us know. There's nothing to think about. I'll do it gladly. - He won't feel anything, right? - Of course not. We'll sedate Max and in a few minutes he'll be in a better world. I've done it many times. Really? - Are you an anesthesiologist? - A veterinarian. Don't worry. I have an excellent anesthetic. I've put many dogs to sleep with this stuff. You're going to put my husband to sleep with a dog anesthetic? Your husband? Higher. Higher, higher, sweetie. You're still up? He'll never let her sleep, - Hey, baby. Don't take her now, I paid for 50 minutes. Sit down for a while, what's the rush? No, Mom, it's way past her bedtime. How is she? I'm fine and you're not going anywhere. Mom, we'll do it tomorrow, okay? Every day you say "tomorrow". Come, I'll dictate it to you. What's the rush, do it over the phone. You stay out of it. Come. Fry the chard leaves in plenty of oil until they turn black. Grind them into a green sauce. Put the green sauce in a pot. Grate an onion and a tomato, with a grater, not a food processor. Coriander, dill, parsley, chop, chop... Then add... You add... You add... Two celery leaves, let it cook, add black pepper, and beans, place the kfitah on top and add water. Yes. My family's genetic map. My father, grandfather, great-grandfather. All of them had a stroke at the age of 78. It took them another 3 years to finally drop dead. My twin brother and I always said we'll spare ourselves the suffering that they went through until... We promised to do it together on our 78th birthday. Everything was ready. My brother was never a man of his word. Changed his mind? No. Hit-and-run. Killed on the spot. I want to see his medical file and then we'll see. If I help you, I need to know that you'll be there for me. At the clinic, I used to inject a sedative and then something to stop the heart. Doesn't it leave any traces in the blood? They don't do autopsies on terminal patients. No one will start an investigation, he's terminal. They'll investigate if he doesn't die. What about the police? Fingerprints? Rafael was a police officer. Segal? Do you trust him? You're asking me to be an accomplice to murder. Do you understand what you're getting yourself into? It's not murder. We want you to conceal the evidence after... If it's not murder, what do you need me for? Let Dr. Daniel put him to sleep, end of story. Me? I'm a vet. I only bring the sedative. I won't put him to sleep. - Yehezkel will inject him. - Me? Are you nuts? Then Yana will. How can I do such a thing? That's why we got a doctor. - I'm only there to supervise. - Fine, I'll inject him. - You'd really do that for him? - Are you for real?! Bunch of idiots... 28... 43... 11... 17... You can fly to Switzerland... It's legal there. He can't sit, how will he fly? Even the morphine doesn't help. He can stop the treatments. Refuse the nourishment. How can I starve him? He's asking us to make it easier on him. I made you something you like. 54... She never makes me any. Eat, Yana. I'll drive you to the hospital. 16... Go ahead, eat. I'm not hungry. You want me to feed you? You still have time to be together. He needs you beside him. - Enough, Levana. - Why? People cling to life until the last moment, why give up? Some people can only move a finger and write books about the universe, with one finger. 21... Bingo. Do we have a winner? No, no. - Sorry, no. - Oh. He'll do it himself. There's Kevorkian's machine, it's mechanical. And this is Dr. Nitschke's machine, it connects directly to the IV. The computer asks the patient questions, and if the patient gives a positive answer the machine releases the anesthetic straight into the IV. - How do we get one? - It's Australian. He assisted some people during the '90s, until it became illegal. Can you build one? I can. A simpler one. Instead of connecting it to a computer, I can connect it to a Sabbath timer. Is everything alright? Sorry to disturb, but you have to see this. I'm not feeling too well, we'll talk tomorrow. You got cold feet? No, of course not, I'm coming down with the flu. I'll make you some tea. Now it looks like you moved in. Look, this isn't a good time. Can we meet tomorrow? So... He activates the timer, your drugs are released automatically. Right? Now, the... - Tapentadol. - Yes, is released, goes through the tube into his arm. And we connect it to his IV. Yes, okay. Yana, are you alright? Are you sure? The Tapentadol should be released first and the KCL a minute later. - Can you delay it for a minute? - A minute? - I'll think of something. - He won't feel any pain, right? That's why we sedate him before releasing the... At least one minute has to pass before we release... before we connect it to the IV... What's with you? Did you forget I was here? Would you mind shutting the door? I just wanted to ask... You're the only ones who know about us, his wife doesn't know yet. He's, you know... in the closet. - It's okay, tell him not to worry. - All the best. That goes for me too, I just want you to know... My mother doesn't know yet. It's a process that... I'm going through. Don't worry, they're very discreet. You promised me you were done with those idiots. You promised me you were done with your wife. What's Ahuva got to do with this? You know that I love you. I don't want you to end up in jail. Then help us. - Yehezkel! - What? - Come on, there's coffee. - Thanks. So what are you building this time? Nothing special. - I should know, shouldn't I? - It's personal. - I don't want to disturb you at work. - C'mon, I won't tell a soul. C'mon, tell me, what's it for? Don't I deserve to know what you're building in my shop? Still acting like he's the boss. I'm building a mercy-killing machine. Okay, fine. You don't want to tell me? Don't. Mercy-killing machine... After 10 seconds he won't feel a thing. After 60 seconds the timer automatically goes on... The IV stops. Then the first drug is released into the IV. And Max goes into a coma, after 10 seconds he feels nothing. Automatically, after 60 seconds, potassium chloride is released causing the heart to stop. You promised me. Levana, sweetheart... You don't understand. What is there to understand? A bunch of murderers, that's what you are! Levana, he'll do it to himself. You stay away from me. I'll turn all of you in. - Enough, Levana. - I'll turn all of you in. - Nothing's happened yet. - You're not going to kill him. You hear me? You're not going to kill him! - Calm down, darling. - Don't touch me. I won't let you kill him! Stay away from me! Don't touch me! Get away from me! - Levana, nothing happened. - I won't let you kill him. I won't let you kill him, - you hear me? - You're not going to kill him. Levana, enough. Get her some water. - Levana... - Calm down. We haven't done anything. Come, sweetheart. - Why kill him... - Come sit down. I want my husband. Levana, - let me take you to our room. - Get my husband, I want my husband. - Yehezkel is here, Levana. - I'm here. - I'm here, Levana. - I want my husband... - Get them out of here. - I want Yehezkel. I'm your husband. I'm Yehezkel. - Go home! - Get my husband. This isn't a pajama party, go home! - Yehezkel... - What's wrong? Help her, Doctor. Me? I'm a veterinarian. - I'm calling a nurse. - That's not necessary. The doctor told me that... this could happen. Get my husband... Go get... Where's Yehezkel? Yehezkel... I want my husband. Excuse me. Hi, Mom. - How are you? - I'm fine. Levana, how old are you? 27. How old are you, Levana? Switch the numbers. - Mom, you gave us a heart attack. - Oh, I'm perfectly fine. Of course you are. You're perfectly fine. Dad, this wasn't the first time nor the second, so... Levana, I want you to answer me please. How much is 100 minus 7? 93. Minus 7? 86. Can we go, Doctor? We have to run some more tests. If everything is alright, you'll go home tomorrow. Thank you. How could you hide this from me? You know her. She didn't want to worry you. You have enough on your own plate. You need to see another neurologist. They must have made a mistake. We've been to all of them. Yana... I have to stay with her. I'm sorry, I can't do it now. Give me a week. Levana will be stronger and... A week? He could be dead in a week. Do you really think I'll let you do this? Alone? I'm willing to kill for you and you say I don't love you enough. Are you out of your mind? Let's go, they're waiting for us. Mrs. Dagan, your discharge notice is ready in the reception. - Have you seen my husband? - No. - Maybe we should come back at night. - So we don't attract attention. I... Max Finkel, I have decided to end my life. If I do it, I'll die. If I don't do it, I'll suffer and then die. Don't worry, it won't hurt at all. I'm sorry. - Look what you've done! - I apologize. - I'm sorry. - It's okay, never mind. It's okay. Give me your right hand. I'll pass the meter from him to you. What's going on? Give me your hand. What are you doing? Whenever you decide. Room 40! We should sue this place for malpractice. - You in a hurry, Gramps? - What's the problem? You were speeding, License, please. That's a 750 shekel fine. There's no need to cry, it's just a ticket. We live on Social Security. Sorry, I started writing it up. Okay, I'll let you go this time. But drive slowly. I said I'm letting you off! You have to talk to him. I'll help you, but it's for your own good, okay? Yehezkel, I know how much you loved him. At least he's not suffering anymore. Have you talked about Neot Hadarim yet? I was just telling Levana that you should go check it out. It's a nursing home that specializes in dementia, they also have a Snoezelen room. Levana is fine. Look at her. God willing, she'll bury me. You spoke to her? Ziva can help me. Yehezkel, assisted living is not a nursing home. Besides, we have no insurance for the mentally frail. A nursing home? You want to leave me? You only think about yourself. Think about it. What assistance do you need? You're completely lucid. You want me to choose a place when I'm not lucid? For heaven's sake... You did it behind my back. You're punishing me. I helped him. You didn't help him, you killed him. Levana... I don't trust you anymore. He pushed the button himself. You saw it with your own eyes. Stop saying that it's just my imagination. You and your conspiracies, enough! I'm telling you, she killed him. Enough! They said that about me when my husband died. The engraving is lovely. - What difference does it make? - I'll bring an Oscularia, it doesn't need much water and it's beautiful, Max will love it. I checked, it's still vacant next to us. This is how you should do it. If you leave the rubber band, people will take the bouquet and put it on another grave. This way they won't. You don't want anyone to take it. Thank you, sir. Nice to meet you. Dubek. You loved him very much, didn't you? Not everyone would've done what you did for him. He found his peace. My wife is very sick. Please, she wants to be with her husband, leave us alone, please. Come, she wants to see you. It's her wish. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't want to cause any trouble, I just need help for my wife. She's very sick. I'm willing to pay a lot of money for you to help her. I wish her well. I'm sorry... You've been misled. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Trust me. How can I trust you? They'll put you in jail any time now. Jail? What did I do? Did I steal? Did I say you stole? You murdered. What has this world come to? Grandpa Teresa, at your age you won't change the world. We'll ignore him and he'll go. Go where? To the police? What do you want me to do? I want you to go and tell him that you're a murderer but not a serial killer. That Dubek guy, isn't he ever going home? - What's wrong with his wife? - What difference does it make? How could he know? Who the hell did you talk to? What is there to know? Is there anyone in this place who doesn't know? He' desperate. He could do anything. If he goes to the police, it's our destiny. He won't go to the police. Let him go. I'll take all the blame. Let's see her. At most, we'll leave them the machine. No way! He'll accidentally put her in a coma with a wrong dose. How are you, Zelda? - What's wrong? - What's all this? I'm moving to my brother in the kibbutz, he has everything. We'll take good care of her. Because of Ziva? She can't kick you out. I want to be near my family. She can't manage alone with all the treatments. Sweetheart, if you need anything, I'm here. Be well. The time now is five o'clock and here is the news: Car accidents claimed five more victims. The Labor union is threatening to go on strike. A 80-year-old man shot his ill wife and then took his own life. The couple left behind a farewell letter. The couple is unknown to social services... May God forgive us. We couldn't do anything about it. It's very sad but it has nothing to do with us. We could've helped them. We could've at least talked to them. It was in our hands. We had the power to help him... and what did we do? Nothing. If I'm guilty of anyone's death, it's the death of her husband. How dare you blame me? It was his wish. We did a good thing. Why didn't I listen to my heart? Enough. We can't do anything about it now. How can you be so sure that it's him? It's Dubek and his wife. You saw how desperate he was. It's not him. It's our fault that he's dead. He shot her and himself! - It's not him. - I'm telling you, it's him. It's not him. God Almighty, how do you know? He's right here. You have an opportunity to help, just come and see her. Do you want them to dig up her husband and do an autopsy on him? Help me or I'll turn you all in. There's no need to dig up anything, I have nothing to hide. I'll turn you all in, I have nothing to lose. I'll turn you all in! She begs me, "Do it, Dubek, do it." But I don't know how. I stood there with the pillow above her head, but I couldn't do it. I don't want her to suffer, she doesn't deserve such a death. And it kills me to watch this disease eating away at her. She doesn't deserve it and I can't help her. What kind of man am I? I love her so much... Help me, I love her so much. She has a few months left to suffer. The doctors can't do anything except try to relieve the pain. And it's not working. She's going through hell. Hell. We'll need to see her, talk to her. We'll see. What does she have? Lung cancer. If you tell me not to do it, I won't go. You made our bed, now we'll lie in it. - Don't eat up all the cookies. - Okay, Grandpa. Very good. - Yuck. - That's not nice, Libby. Why yuck? I put salt. Never mind... we'll make new ones. How many did I put in? I, Clara Lemberg, wish to die with dignity. For five years I've been fighting this disease that's eating away at me. Stop. Could you film me from the other side? Left isn't my good side. I'm thinking only of myself. What about you? You know me, I always manage. I'll be fine. I have to go. Remember our first date at Cafe Atara? You kept saying: "I have to go", "I have to go." We talked until 5 a.m. and you kept saying: "I have to go." And we stayed on, to this day. It wasn't Cafe Atara. We met at Moon Grove. Cafe Atara was with your first wife. May she rest in peace. In Neverland Echo through the land The harp, the lute and flutes And in the nearby silence, in the Neverland Beat the drums of great longing Take me there now, I do not know the way To this land that I am yearning for, To Neverland In Neverland, The citrus and sunflowers Blossom in all their glory In Neverland, snow and dew and rain fall in season Take me there now, I do not know the way To this land that I am yearning for, Neverland... Mom? Hello? - Hello, Dad? - Noa, how are you? Dad, where are you? Dad? Dad... You again? What now? Was I speeding again? You were talking on your phone. Me? No way. Hello, Dad? Dad, answer me. Too bad, it's a 1000 shekel fine. Ma'am, last time was much more convincing. No way I am canceling this ticket too. Step out of the car, I'm not in the mood for this. Are you alright? Take it easy. Get some fresh air. Nice and easy. I'll cancel it! Mom, do you know that your kitchen is full of smoke? What is this? Yuck! What is this? That's disgusting, throw it away! Stop it, Mom. Mom, stop it! Mommy... Mommy... Mommy... You're healthier than me. You can go home. You can even run, if you want. Are you sure? Shouldn't you double-check? I felt as though my heart stopped. Half the people who come to the ER with a heart attack actually had an anxiety attack. Feel well. Thank you. Why are you calling her? To tell her that I'm fine? Do you know how many times I called you? - Where were you? - I'm here. How dare you leave Libby alone with her? Ziva arranged for us to see some places. You can join us. What is it to you? Is her guardian dead that you allow yourself to meddle? Do you hear yourself? You left her alone. And nothing happened. Nothing happened? If you call this nothing, then what has to happen? Dad, wake up. I thought you were with her! You think I'd leave them alone? Mother helps you out and that's what you have to say about her? Are you alright? She's worried as it is, you know her, stop giving her a hard time. Libby. Give me a duckie kiss. - Shall we go home? - Yes. Good, let's go. Soon I won't know my own name. You know it can't be treated. We've had a good life. What kind of talk is that? I'm disappearing, Yehezkel. I won't be myself anymore. Just a shell. We'll talk about it tomorrow. You'll wake up tomorrow and see everything differently. My grandkids must be here already. - You just got here. - Don't start. You complain when I'm not here and you complain when I am here. - You're never going to leave her. - I need more time. I can't bring myself to talk to her now, you know she's ill. She has the flu. I wanted you to move here so we could spend more time together. Are we unhappy like this? I'm unhappy. Why did I move here? To see you and Ahuva eating breakfast, lunch and dinner? I wait all week for you and when you finally get here, you go. You feel like it...? What does sex have to do with it? Yes. I have to hear about it from other people? Everyone's talking about her anyway. Now you're talking too? Talking? We're worried about her! Don't worry, she's fine, she'll be right down. We're only trying to help, Yehezkel. Yehezkel... Nothing happened. Everyone saw me, what will I do now? What will I do? So you gave the guys something to look at. They're crazy about you. They asked me if you'd be coming down for breakfast too. Remember how we used to sunbathe in Nuweiba? We left nothing for the imagination. A la naturelle. We let them enjoy it. We were the hot chicks from Jerusalem. I won't show my face outside... And your body? Don't cry... My darling sweetheart, let's go down to eat. I don't want breakfast. Breakfast? It's almost dinner time. Stop it, Levana, really. What's over is over. Dead. Let's go and get a breath of fresh air. You don't want to go out? Fine. Promise me that we'll go to the garden after everyone goes to sleep. Promise? We'll go down after everyone is asleep? - Okay. - Great. We'll go down at seven. You lost all your clothes at a poker game again? You're all mad. I'm a veterinarian. Levana, it's medicinal. Have you come to sunbathe for old time's sake? You think you're the only hot chick around here? This is strong stuff. It's strong. - Yehezkel... Cheers, guys. - Cheers. Cheers. Aren't you guys hot? Come on, Yehezkel. Cheers. I feel like you're undressing me with your eyes. Have you no shame? At your age? Aren't you ashamed? That's it, Yana? You're finished mourning? Dr. Daniel, would you like me to talk to your mother? What's that got to do with it? Does Ahuva know you're exposing yourself while she's asleep? This place has a reputation, sir! I'm sending you all warning letters. You think you're helping her this way? You think you're helping her this way? She needs... I'm here, you can talk to me. There's nothing I want more than to have you stay with us, but I don't have the proper medical support for you. We have no insurance for the mentally frail. Mentally frail? Does she look mentally frail to you? And you say I should be ashamed? Noa has already made an appointment for me at Neot Hadarim. Yehezkel, she's right. I don't belong here anymore. Don't be angry at them, they mean well. Inside, they're like children, only their bodies have aged. Thank you. We'll go see the place tomorrow. Why's she butting in. I won't leave you for a second and you're fine now. Why's she driving you crazy?! I may be fine now, but what about a month or two from now? Yehezkel, I don't know what to do, we got another call. Yana, please... I have to be with Levana now. When they get to this stage they have no idea what's going on. Downstairs they're fully independent, occupational therapy, activities, etc. Here they get personal care, 24/7. Have a look around, then come to my office, okay? Can I go out for a smoke? Since when do you ask me what to do? Hello. Nice to meet you, I'm Levana. How's the staff? Nice? How about the food? Quiet a chatter mouth... Sorry, there's no smoking here. That place isn't for you. We shouldn't have gone there. I'd never put you in such a place. You heard her. I won't know where I am, so what difference does it make? It makes a difference to me. You and I, we're in this together. I'm in this alone. I made a mistake. Did you tell him it was Zelda? Yehezkel is with Levana. Please, Menahem, you promised not to make a fuss. Tell Dad that I'm running the whole dairy farm. I can't lie to Dad. You can press the button now. Goodbye, Menahem. The circuit breaker blew. - Zelda, are you alright? - Go turn the switch on. Hello? You know I can't come. I can't leave her now. Zelda? I'm sorry, I can't. That's it, sweetheart? You're giving up? I fought, Yehezkel. My body can't take it anymore. I can't lie and wait for Him anymore. They suggested an experimental treatment that could prolong her life by a few months. In a month I'll be 90 and they're fighting over me as if I were 16. Enough. I've had enough. We're all fighting for you. You know how much we love you and how happy were are that you're here. Your whole life you didn't give a damn. You didn't get married, you didn't have children. You were always stubborn. You tell her, maybe she'll listen to you. Enough, Menahem. You can't teach an old dog new tricks. She's continuing her teenage rebellion as if she were 16. My time has come. So... Tell me, Yehezkel, any vacancies in heaven? Everything's okay now, you can push the button. Night, night, the wind is growing stronger Night, night, the treetops whisper Night, night, a star is singing Go to sleep, go to sleep, blow out the candle Go to sleep... What the hell is this? You promised to be discreet. This is a kibbutz, you know. - Okay. Disconnect the machine. - What? Let's go! This machine just died on me. Maybe it's a sign. It was a sign, Yehezkel. A sign from God. I'm sorry. - Segal! - Yes? - There's money missing here. - You take money? I don't know what he's talking about. It's 5000 shekels short. You took money from him? After all, we took a risk, didn't we? Good night. Good night? - You sure you'll be able to sleep? - Like a baby. Are you coming? - Give him back his money. - The money isn't important. Go. Tell me, what business is it of yours? I want to know who else you took money from. Did he take money from you? So what? What'll I do with money when I'm in the grave? A clear conscience is enough for me. How many more people are we going to kill to clear your conscious, Yana? I didn't know any of this. I can't say that I'm surprised. When you learn not to expect, you won't be disappointed. I never believed you'd leave her. I'd love to continue this conversation, but I'm expected at home. Like I said, good night. Yehezkel, leave him alone. We'll pay Zelda back. I want you to return the money now, to everybody. I'm not giving back a dime. You feel important, Yehezkel? You think you're Superman? Aren't those shoes a bit big for you? Fuck you! Playing the saint. We almost killed her, and she didn't even want to die. And you snub me for taking money? Lucky she didn't change her mind five minutes later. I, Max Finkel, have decided to end my life. If I do it, I'll die. If I don't do it, I'll suffer and then die. I drove her crazy, they needed me like a hole in the head. Why are you doing this to yourself? I, Clara Lemberg, wish to die with dignity. For five years I've been fighting this disease... Levana, it's 3 a.m. Enough, Levana. Enough... How about a cup of tea? Alisa, two teas, please. How are you, Yehezkel? Fine. How is she? Don't worry, it'll be okay. - Are you blind? - I'm sorry. Look what you've done. All I asked for was a cup of tea. You don't need a high school diploma for that. What did she tell you? What did she talk to you about? She asked about the machine? Ask her yourself. You wanted to go to lectures? Let's go to your lectures. Today there's one on Picasso's. Tomorrow there's one on Salvador Dali, On Thursday, "Urinary Tract Infections - Treatment and Coping." You want to see another nursing home? Those places aren't for me. Levana, I don't want to repeat myself, and I don't care if you go behind my back a thousand times and talk to the whole world. There's no more machine! All your favorite things are here. I went all out. I can't eat before I take my pills. Maybe you put them somewhere else. The bathroom maybe? I'll ask Noa to bring me. Noa? Why Noa? Get dressed and we'll go. I'm not up to it. You can go if you like. How are you, Yehezkel? Thank God, fine. How is she? I want to see her. No, that's impossible. I know this is hard for you. Yana, you made the decisions concerning your husband, leave my wife to me. Max didn't have to go behind my back to ask for help. Stop interfering in my life and get out of my sight. Yehezkel, she's worried about her. One more word... I swear, I'll go to the police and turn you all in. You mean, all of us. Levana... Levana... Wake up, sweetheart. Levana! Levana, wake up! Levana, wake up! Levana! You're a righteous man. She's lucky to have you. If we had come five minutes later, God forbid, she'd be in heaven. She has great merit. You're fortunate. My darling Noa, I ask you not to judge me, I know you're angry at me now for not sharing my decision with you, I know you would have objected. But with every passing day, I feel that... I'm losing a little bit of myself, I don't know what awaits me tomorrow and what part of me will disappear. I want you to remember me the way I am, your mother. Not this terrible disease. My little one... Please don't be mad at your father. He loves me enough to let me go. Give me a duckie kiss.
