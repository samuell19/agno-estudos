Oh, I don't know. So, tell us about this job? Yes, of course, so... I'd like to ask you officially if you would like to participate in this project When is it? We have to make some plans, you could do it from Portugal, you email it to me, and then You'd have to be in Paris for Christmas. That was you could spend Christmas with us, it'd be fun. Christmas... that would make it around December or January perhaps. That would be cool, and Marie would love it. We've separated, so it won't really work out. You've separated? Yes. You're getting divorced? Yes. Not you two? Well yes. Why not us? Well wait, you guys are a model We're a model? Yes, you guys are a model couple! Really? Yes. - Like the houses in Phoenix? - Yes.

Yes it's true. - So, are you going to stop by the house? - No, I won't have time. - Yes? - No. It's the job. No but it's okay isn't it? Why not, it's interesting. But I'm not coming to Paris. Why? Why? We're not going to run into each other in Paris are we? You both want to live in Paris? You're afraid we'll pass each other on the street. okay now... I should have kept my mouth shut. Yeah, you wouldn't have ruined dinner, because now... You're not angry are you? No I'm not upset, I'm just... It came as a surprise. Unhappily surprised. But I'm okay, I'll be alright. Perhaps they'll end up married afterwards, you never know. That happens sometimes! People do that now, they divorce then get married again. Yeah, people should get married for 5 years, with the option to renew or not. That way, every five years we should try... Excuse me. It's like the driver's license, there's a country like that where... You have to keep on re-taking the driver's license exam every 5 years or every 10 years Suzon has her last driver's license, she shouldn't get anymore! Seriously! 92 years old It's like... It's like my Uncle Jean... He died at 103 years old. At 101 years old, he drove all over France He only knew how to go forward, he didn't know how to reverse! Did he get married afterwards? No but in love. He was very in love. Always in love. Thank you. Are you feeling better? Sure, I'm fine. We were joking around. Nothing... Could I have a taste? Are you okay? I'm okay. Look... in full health... happy. He put on his nice suit. Are you okay? I'm fine. - You don't look well. - What do you mean? You can talk to me if you want. No, really I'm fine. And you? Are you okay? No, but really, I'm okay. - Is there anything? - No, I'm fine. You don't have to look at me as though I were a victim. That's not it, I was just asking how you're doing. No, I'm fine, you're making it feel like a funeral But it's okay, we're separating, that's all, it's not that serious of an issue. If it's simple for you, all the better. No, but it's not an issue of if it's simple or not... you're looking at me as if... It just looks like you're not well. I just don't like how you're looking at me. Hello? It's Elodie. Hello Elodie, how are things going? Pretty well, he's been good, we're getting ready for bed now. What did you do? Some video games, there was something on TV Yeah? And is he happy? Everything was okay but he lost one of his toys and I'm not sure what to do Oh really? Let me talk to him. Yes, let me talk to him. Hello Ferdinand? Mom? Yes, how are you doing dear? - I'm going back upstairs - Yes, see you in a bit. What? I think I know where it is. Yes. okay, ask Elodie to look in my room It's right on the windowsill.

Who knew that I've become a socialite... I don't know. But you... You're superficial. Please... listen to you. You're superficial. Well look, if you want, then I'm superficial. We've know each other for 15 years 15 years that you see me as superficial - That's enough. - Well then I don't know you. You've changed. There. okay, that's it then, I've become superficial Yes. If that's what you want. It's true! It's sad. Yes it's sad. Very sad. bourgeois and superficial Now at this time of night you're able to find plenty of names like "bourgeois" I don't love you. Well that works out well for both of us then. How so? Oh I don't know. if you don't love me What do you want me to tell you? You're with a superficial idiot who you don't love. I didn't say "idiot", I said "socialite". Oh, it's the same thing. I'd rather be an idiot. Everything you do, even right now, like how you're smoking your cigarette You're going to let it all out now, huh? You're going to throw everything in my face right now, right? You don't see how everything you do is false. How you speak, how you decide... things like how we're fine, how we decided to do it together, how you talk about us... What do you want me to say? It just came out, I already told you. I regret it. What do you regret? I don't understand what you're saying. I regret having said it to them. There. You don't regret a thing. It's not going to close? Damn, leave me alone. What do you regret? Huh? As for me, I regret things. In fact, all that I have are things that I regret. Everything I have. Everything I have inside me. Everything I have. Everything that you've left me, that's it. It's everything. Nothing else. As for me, I truly regret it. You don't really regret it. I know what it means. Can you at least say something? Excuse me. Excuse me. Sleep well. Sleep well, my dear. Now we arrive at the year 1880 Rodin's "Gates of Hell" is inspired by a poem by Dante he's going to use a large number of small statues that are all going to end up on the infamous Gates What's interesting is that he modelled a lot of men and women and sometimes he's going to wait to assemble them to create this couple for example of the Eternal Idol that he'll finish in 1891 It's said that this is the date that Camille Claudel, the great love of his life becomes pregnant. The couple has inspired poets, like Rilke, who was Rodin's secretary in 1906 but who wrote some texts about the sculptor and he spoke about this sculpture saying: "Something of the mood of a Purgatorio lives within this work. " "A heaven is near that has not yet been reached," "a hell is near that has not yet been forgotten. " Now we find ourselves in front of Eve, on the Gates of Hell with Adam And there's an anecdote that Rodin told to Dujardin-Beaumetz He said his model posed regularly for him and each day he saw the body transforming He didn't understand until the woman told him that she was pregnant. Of course the sessions ended. Rilke says some beautiful things about this: "The back is rounded, the nape of the neck almost horizontal. " "She bends forward as though listening over her own body in which a new future begins to stir. " "And it is as though the gravity of this future weighed up on the senses of the woman... " "and drew her down from the freedom of life into the deep, humble service of motherhood. " ...some other sculptures Can I read you something while this is drying? Honestly, now is not a good time. It's short... just while this dries. - Huh? - Go on, yes? - But are you listening? - Yes I'm listening to you Marie. Wait, I'm putting on a second layer. - Marie! - It's okay. Listen, will you? It's Rilke, who's writing about Rodin - Are you listening? - Yes. Here is life.. a thousand times in each minute... a thousand times in each minute... In desire, and in pain in dementia and anguish - Well that's very nice Marie - Wait, listen to me One sentence. But you can read it at night Listen to just one sentence But Marie, damn, we're late. Please! I love Rilke, well go on. Hurry up. Please. - Will you read it tonight? - okay. I can't do anything until it's dry. okay, I'm going to help you. okay, tell me...

Do you know a lawyer here in Paris? A lawyer? I know a lot of lawyers. That's not what I'm asking, I know you know lawyers. - Do you want a woman or a man? - I don't care. Why a lawyer? You're a pain. What? Nothing. Is your wife okay? What about her? She's in there. No, I mean... My wife's in there. - Do you want something to drink? - Did you invite her? - I want to get out of here. - You didn't invite her? One second, I'll be right back. I'm sure he didn't invite her, he's scared. - Of course he did. - He's afraid of her. I invited her. And? It's okay, people have been saying it's not okay. Here. What's not normal? Do you want some? No.. yes.. that's enough. What's not normal? I don't know, that I invited an ex- Of course it's normal. Marie and Nicolas met at your marriage. - "Funny guy" - Please. - Marie? - 15 years ago. You don't remember? Bless you! Excuse me. Thank you. Bless you! Do you have a cigarette? You're beautiful. You've very beautiful, Marie. You're magnificent. That's the last cigarette. Do you have a light? You stopped smoking? Yes. One second. Is that okay? Yes. Hey... what is it? What are you doing here? I thought you left. I'm looking for my keys. No! She's looking for her keys. Esther! You lost your keys? They're inside. Who has Esther's keys? okay, let's look. They aren't on the terrace? Natacha's going to look. You were sitting next to Jacques for an entire hour. Yes you were. Jacques, get up. Look for the keys Jacques. Yeah that's it... Search through Jacques' clothes! He has them. Vincent! Vincent Typical of Jacques. She lost her keys! Look upstairs. Did you go upstairs? Did you go upstairs or not? Did she go upstairs or not? - Yes. - No you were sitting there. And so? Right now. There. Move over. - Oh I found them! - Ah! - Yes - That's it? Natacha, we found them. What? Natacha we found the keys, it okay, come back down. Oh you found them? They were... - ... the keys here. - in the cracks of the sofa. You put the keys there! I didn't put the keys there. It was the cushions. He's sleeping. No, no, he's sleeping. But you two just met, she came here alone. Were you two...? - No because... - Stop! Stop with that! I like your work. No because... She just told me a little earlier Yes, but you don't have to be so... I'm introducing you to Marie Arguance, Nicolas' wife. I spilled a little bit of champagne. Marie, this is Esther. You do photography right? Not at this moment. I saw some of your photos, that were published. Come, dance with me. He's annoying isn't he? He's very annoying. How long has he been a friend of yours? 20 years. 20 years? 20 years. - You went to school with Jacques? - Yes. - Your professor? - Yes. He left, but then he came back. Because I know he still does speeches and various things Yes and very good ones, very interesting. What's up Vincent? Are you feeling...? No, I'm going to get something to drink. That's a good idea. I'd like to have kids, but... Yes Jacques does too! But I don't believe in marriage. - She believes in divorce! - You're not allowed to have kids? Yes. It's possible. But we could still be lovers and then have kids. Of course, you can be lovers with whoever you want. But it's also perhaps a sort of... I'm not sure exactly what, but a child brings a feeling of a... uh... It's kinda solemn, I should have mentioned it to you earlier, but I didn't have time. But perhaps it would be better said another time. It's the country where we're from, it's the... We've gone out, and if we don't come back occasionally... if we don't have a child we cannot return. I don't think this, so a child is... So it's not having a child or the act of doing so... But it's the returning... if we don't return to our youth, it's stupid. Adults who never return to their childhood who decided that they're adults and no longer children, just adults. It makes you want to cry... or even vomit or something, no? Right? Of course we agree! We all agree! Go on, Vincent. Should I put on some music or what? Yes, please. So... how... You're drunk! A little bit. How did you know... how did you know his work? Would you like some water? No thanks. How long are you going to be in a bad mood? Huh? Hey. The whole taxi ride... All night. I'm not in a bad mood. Well you're not so joyful are you? Great! So tell me. Huh? If you need to use the bathroom, go on, so that I can use it... and then go to sleep. Go ahead, Marie. What's wrong? - Hurry up with the bathroom, I want to sleep - What's wrong? What's wrong? Go on, tell me. What's wrong? There's nothing wrong. But really, what is it? Did something happen tonight? Yes... there's always a lot of stuff happening. You see? Go on, please tell me. Marie, please. What do you want me to tell you? I don't know! Tell me what's wrong, why you appear to be in such a bad mood. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. You didn't have to come back here. I wasn't obligated? Because even if I come home or stay out, it's still the same problem. There's always a problem. Always. There's always something that's not right. What? You smell like alcohol. Yes, I... Yes, that's it. Why didn't you stay there? Because I didn't feel like staying there, otherwise I would have stayed there. I'm a grown-up and I can do what I want. That's for sure. So there. You're nice too. I'm what? You're nice. Wow, Marie. - Don't start, don't start, don't start with me. - You're a nice boy. Don't tell me that. Stop looking for something Marie. You're a nice mommy's boy. I don't know what you're looking for, but... I'm going out, that would be better. Another one please? Thanks. Yes? Hello? Yes. I'm not sure who this is, did you call? It's Nicolas. Is everything okay? What are you doing? I'm in a caf?. Would you like to join me? One second... Where are we? What's the address? What's the address? "5, rue Manuel" We're at 5, rue Manuel. in a caf? Ch?teau Rouge Caf? Ch?teau Rouge Caf? Ch?teau Rouge, 5, rue Manuel. Okay? I'll be waiting for you. See you in a bit. Good evening. Good evening. Are you waiting for someone? Yes. Ah, you're lucky. You don't think so? No, but of course. As for me, I'm not waiting for anyone. And my glass continues to accompany me, that's all. That's good company. That depends. That depends because... Do you look in your glass occasionally? Rarely. Do you see things? What, like the future? Ha, the future. The future. Sure one could see the future, you could see the future... As for me, I certainly can't. Mine's a bit past. It's more like... the past that comes out of the glass. or one's head, I don't know. I don't really know. And the past can sometimes be very far away. - Do you see what I mean? - Yes... I think... I don't know for you perhaps it's closer. - My past is closer? - Yes. Maybe it will come, maybe it won't come, maybe... who knows? Yes, who knows. When I was young I did a bit of everything and nothing. And then one day... bang! The army recruited me. - The army? - Yes. Yes at that time there were people who were lucky and students who didn't go right away. Me, I was no longer a student or anything, so I went. It's just one of those things. I'm sure things have happened to you too, that you didn't know about. Of course. We don't know everything. You see, when I look into my glass like this... it reminds me of... We were walking through the night and slept in the day, where we were. We were walking at night... We were waiting for someone to shoot at us or we'd shoot at something or.. until someone did something stupid. There were some stupid things that happened, some were serious not pretty. Because... Perhaps it's fear... When you're at mercy or going to die. It seems like the best thing would be to kill another person. You know, the army loves that. So they'll kill another person to overcome their fear? More or less yes. I can't prove anything, and I'm not a... I'm not really... well anyway, that's what I think. It's... When we were talking earlier about love... perhaps something like this happens as well? Of course we don't always kill the other person! But... perhaps fear leads us to do stupid things... no? I don't know, maybe you would know better than me? I don't know. I don't know. But I've... I've never thought about it from that angle, but it's interesting. - Everything okay? Oops! - Yes. - You walked? - Of course. I kinda took my time, I didn't end up making it back home. - That worked out well for both of us then. - Yes. What will you have? - Oh, I'll have a tea. - A tea. Sir? Could we have a tea and a beer? So you couldn't sleep? No. It's been a while since I've walked around in Paris. I wanted some light and... you came in... certainly. A tea for the lady... So what are you doing these days? I got a scholarship, and now I'm at a museum. - Really? - Yes. And it's...? It's kinda complicated to... It's a museum on an island, right on the coast. That tells the story of... the story of... the place. Nature. - Fauna and flora and? - Everything. A sort of presentation... But everything has to be done, I mean, the whole thing has to be built. It has to be designed, etc. - Ah so it's not in a specific...? - And we have to plan the whole route, etc. That tells the story of... - So it doesn't actually exist yet? - No. Well, the island exists! No, no, the island, I know. You're silly. okay, I got it, the island doesn't have to be built... No. That will save some time! No, the island is there! So while the island exists... Age does that to you. I live here. - Here? - Yes. Ah, the vodka! - Do you have your keys? - Sure. See you tomorrow? Go on. What time is it? Six or seven o'clock? I'm not sure. I didn't sleep. - What? - I didn't sleep. Where were you? I walked around. I walked around. Then I went to a caf?. You wanted to get some fresh air? Yeah, that's it. You didn't take a sleeping pill? What? - You didn't take a sleeping pill? - No. I don't take sleeping pills. But I didn't understand, where did you say you were? ...Marie, I walked around, I went to a caf?. What for? Because I felt like walking and I felt like going to a caf?, that's why. What do you want me to tell you? Yes, that's true. Huh? Yes. Imagine that. I needed to walk. You need to feel free? Well you're also free. Yes. I don't know what that's supposed to mean. Here, take some water. I'm not free, I'm alone. I've been alone for years. You're happy about this, aren't you? That everything is finishing, right? You're impatient... That's what I didn't understand. Now I understand it. I'm going to end up a lonely, old woman, and you're going to be a... a young free man. Serves me right. I should have been nicer. Serves me right. I think you're handsome. I don't know what we did. Speak, you idiot. I don't know, I'm... I'm going to be a failure... Start again I made a mistake. You're going to leave me here speaking to myself? You're not going to say anything? You're not saying anything? You're tired? We'll sleep now? Good night. Likewise. Good night. Marie Marie Patrick - Patrick Duval? - Yes. - How are you? - I'm well. Emmett Hello Say "hello" Hello Marie How are you? I'm fine. Patrick Duval I'm happy to see you. It's been a while. Oh of course. - What are you doing here? - Uh... No I mean... what are you doing in Paris? Do you still live in Paris? No, no, I don't live here I've never really lived... well I lived here... several years ago. 2 or 3 years But I don't live here at all. and where do you live now? - Now I live in Lisbon. - Ah Lisbon. Have you been there for a long time? For several years. - You live here? - Yes, I've been here for over 15 years now. Over 15 years. - And you're just passing through? - Yes. It's hard to believe that we just ran into each other here! How amazing. The last time... The last time was... Last time it was in Bordeaux - Right? - Yes. - It was in Bordeaux - Was it Lacanau? That's it, Lacanau. On the beach Good memory! You were windsurfing Oh... sure! I used to be, a long time ago I used to be stronger. And your husband? I uh... I... Do I know him? He was at Bordeaux, but he doesn't know you. - He wasn't really in our... - In our crowd? Well sure. In fact, I even met him in Paris. - In Paris? - Yes. At the School of Beaux-Arts. But he's from Bordeaux. Perhaps that it, how we met. So you're still in photography? No. In my head, I take pictures in my head. Oh, that's too bad! It's really too bad. I really liked your work. Yes. But I don't know... - You didn't feel like doing it anymore? - Yes, but... Emmett If you stay far from us we can't see what you're doing. I figured that it could exist or not exist and it wouldn't change anything. Move over. - Really? - Yes... it was... pretty. No, I thought it was more than just "pretty" No, sincerely, I thought it was good. Maybe I'll take it up again. Good idea. I'd love to come live in Paris, and take pictures. I'd like so many things. Perhaps 10 years in Lisbon is too long? okay Emmett, what did you make? What is it this time? I might... I might come back... perhaps come back alone. We may get divorced. - Perhaps? - Perhaps yes. - So you're not sure? - No... uh... That's true it's a big decision. How long have you been living together? Oh, about 15 years. That's a long time. Is it a sun? How pretty! What is it? Oh it's certainly a sun. Let me put on my glasses to see it better. Ah wonderful! You know it almost looks like a pumpkin. Is that what it is? No? So who is this drawing for? Is it for me or for Marie? It's for me? No. It's for Marie! Oh it's for me? But you have to sign it! - You didn't sign it? - Yes I did. What do you want to do right now?
