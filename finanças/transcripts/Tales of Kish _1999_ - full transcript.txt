"The Greek Boat" By Naser Taghvai Jomeh? If all humans gather around and put their minds together, They won't find out about the source of these cartons! When you contemplate, even God can't understand how the sea works. The sea is very mysterious inside and out. Sometimes it's empty, and other times it's filled with fishes. Sometimes it brings lots of stuff with it... flotsam, empty bottles, barrels... And other times nothing. Land is closefisted. But the sea is very generous. Of course, And if you pay attention, everything... from the land, comes from the sea in the first place. Look at all of these cartons! Where did they come from? Shanbeh, instead of talking nonsense... Dive! These cartons are our livelihood today. - Aren't you hungry? - I have to work! - The lunch is ready. - I'll be there in a minute. What are you doing in here? I'm repairing the shed. When there isn't any cigarette in the shop, What's the use for all of these cartons? If it is destined, the sea brings cigarette too. Jomeh promised to unload all of them from the boat today. And I'm going to repair this damn shed. It looks good, isn't it? These aren't ours! Why are they coming this way? They wanted to come this way. I can't tell them otherwise, Can I? It seems that You're intending to bring more cartons from the ship. Of course, they became dry. The wind will carry them. Don't go to bring more of them. My dear, our livelihood is cartons today! Why shouldn't I go? Do you think I'm like you that scare from everything. Could they belong to the Arabs on other side of the island? Since when you scare from the Arabs? I'm just saying that! I don't scare from the Arabs. If the cartons belong to them, They may run after these. Don't say things just for fun! When you get concerned, you start talking nonsense. Shanbeh! Shanbeh! Why are you yelling? What's going on? - Shanbeh! - What? Your wife is out of her mind. Yeah, She's not okay since yesterday. She locks herself in the shed. I don't know what's wrong with her. Why don't you take her to Baba Ayoob? He'll diagnose what's wrong as soon as seeing her. - How should I take her? - Nonsense! With a boat or with a car. She becomes so tense. It's very difficult. We have to take her anyway. - You should piggyback her! - Piggyback? Are you afraid to do so? Which man is afraid of his wife, that I would be the next one? I can't do that on my own. So we'll take her there together. It's not her fault. She's just out of her mind. - Hello! - Hello! Well, what's going on Jomeh? - Shanbeh's wife is out of her mind. - How so? I don't know, she's acting weird for the past couple of days. Bring her! What's wrong? - It's hot in here. - Well, it's very usual these days. It's hot for everyone, not just for us! - Hello! - Hello! [Traditional Hymns] Bravo! Bravo! Well done! Bravo! Well done! Bravo! Expose your hand! Tell me! What are you afraid of? Stranger! Unknown person! - I'm afraid of strangers! - Where is this stranger came from? G... Greece! Hush! What is this stranger look like? - Boat! - Huh! The Greek boat! Hush! What does it look like? Carton! Box! Cardboard! Baba Ayoob, she is afraid of everything. She's afraid of the night, She's afraid of the day, She's afraid of the Arabs... Are cartons scary? Are you in love with cartons or your wife? Your wife or carton? I built a wonderful shed for her. - Jomeh, you saw it, isn't it beautiful? - Of course! If you don't like cartons, look away. - Shanbeh! - Huh! You have to choose. Your wife or cartons! You tell me! If you still want her... Throw away all the cartons you've collected. There are lots of them! Where could I throw them? Into the sea! The sea Brought them here and it'd take them away! "The Ring" By Abolfazl Jalili [ Prepayment: 1000 Toman ] - Hello sir! - Hello! - Dial this number, please. - Where?

You change your place frequently. Don't come again! Don't come! We don't want any letter anymore Why did you bother yourself? Don't look about us! Give back the letter! - Give it back! - I've told the post office. I've told them that you sold all of your belongings, Except a door and its tag. Give it back to them. We don't want it anymore. Dear Uncle, Is this the old door you've talked about? Is it? Turn around! It's useless. It's good for nothing. Turn around! Well, it's really useless. There isn't any use in it! How much do you sell it? You came all this way just for that? It's quite useless. Come on! It's an Antique. Come on! Buy it! The door is perfect. It's good. It's old, but still it's really good.
