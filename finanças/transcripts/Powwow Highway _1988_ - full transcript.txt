Rule is the man at the White House. Hey man, am I gonna get a shot off or what? Coal mine at big mountain. All right! That's the Swinomish Pipeline. Can he shoot or what? And that monstrosity out on 314. Right. That's my man! Let's go Red Bow. I'll whip your ass this time. Let it go, Louie. Let it go. - Hey, hey! - Who's up next here? Hey, we'll see ya Buddy! Hey Buddy. Philbert. How you doing? What's up Manny. You gonna right this bylaw? You get it right, Philbert? Hey Manny! Where's those onion rings? We got Mustangs! We got Broncos! We got Benzes! They're hot for trot and ready to roll. A'ho, folks, this old cowboy's on the war path with eight big savings. All our choice of stock! So come on down off the res or the ranch and pick out your pony today. Never any money down, easy credit, terms available! Yeehaw! Giddy-up, boys! Fidel, I want to buy one of your fine ponies. Take a look around. That old brown one's a nice one. Shit, that one? How much? How much you got? I'll go start it up. Yeah! Yeehoo! Renewing Overdine Corporation's lease may be the most profitable decision this tribe will ever make. Now let's consider the benefits, council. One, our mining program will provide more jobs for your people. Two, optimal usage of tribal land resources. Three, and most significantly, economic autonomy for the entire Lame Deer community. Now when you vote next Thursday, I know you'll make the right choice. Thank you ladies and gentlemen, and Merry Christmas. Any questions? Yeah! How much you pay for that suit? Pretty good show you put on, you know that? Cruising into town in your Chrysler LeBaron, talking about what's good for the tribe. You're out of line, Mr. Red Bow. Oh, well I guess I just don't understand, Mr. Youngblood. You talk about jobs; how come since Overdine's been on the res unemployment's gone up, not down? Ah, statistically speaking though, that's not true. Our employment contracts are a matter of public record. Oh yeah, I read your contract. I read every damn contract since the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, and it's always the same deal, ain't it? You get what you want, and we get the shaft. We're all working for the same goal here, Mr. Red Bow. We're on your side. That's why I'm here. I know what you side you're on. 75 percent of our people living below the poverty line, and you tell us that stripping off what's left of our natural resources is going to change that. Maybe you better tell us something different. This ain't the American Dream we're living. This here's the third world! There she is, let's go. Thanks for buying me the new toy, Mom. I can't believe this. What's wrong, Mom? There's a cop car behind us, and I'm not speeding. You still gotta stop. What did we do, Mom? I don't know, honey. Could I please see your driver's license, ma'am? What's the problem? I was only doing 35. And your automobile registration please. You Bonnie Red Bow? Yes. Are you aware that there are no plates on this vehicle? I've got plates. Step out of the car, please. Why? Step outside of the car, please. What did I do? What are you doing? You're supposed to have a warrant. What's that, Mom? Yeah, what is it, Mom? Domestic or imported? You must've put that there. No ma'am, we found it there. Red Bow. Who's this? Bonnie? My sister Bonnie? Wait a second, I can't... Busted for what? Aw, hell. Hey, wait a minute, I got not bail money. Bonnie, I got no way to get down there. I couldn't leave now even if I wanted to. Well... What the hell you expect? I ain't heard nothin' from you for... it's been 10 years! What kids? Turn on the light. I can't see shit! Aunt Harriet. Aunt Harriet, in the old days, how long did it take a warrior to gather medicine? What you do, find a token in a Cracker Jack box? I had a sign. The time has come for me to gather medicine. I already have a pony. What did the old ones say about... I get sick of being asked for good old Indian wisdom. I ain't got none, so get the hell out of here! Hey, Philbert, come. Here's a quote from Dull Knife. He once told my great uncle Benny Looks Twice. He said, "Keep your pony out of my garden." Keep your pony out of my garden? Well, that angus had a rip in his ear but, uh, the highlanders were primed. Hell, I think we did pretty good at 22.50. You know the ones I mean? Buddy? Yeah, yeah, the highlander with the ripped ear and the angus. Hey you got something on your mind? What the hell's wrong with you? Nothin.' You got the money? You just bring back the right bulls, huh? Okay, come over here and sign this receipt. Hey, Philbert! Hey, stop. Roll down the window. Roll the window down, man. Oh, hey. Hey, so... so Philbert, whose car is this? I made a trade, as from the days when men possessed nothing. Uh huh, but whose car is this, man? This is Protector, the war pony! Ah, this is your car, yeah? Good. Here. Thanks. Hey, Philbert. We gotta go to Santa Fe. Santa Fe, New Mexico? Uh huh. You and me? That's right. There's a powwow in Billings. Who gives a shit about that, man? I got a call from my sister. Bonnie? She's been away so long, man. She got busted down there, pigs pulled her over, just like that, a pound of Colombian under the spare. Can you believe that, man? You got heat in this tank? You got gas money? Over two grand. - Cash? - You bet. It's from the travel accounts to buy bulls. What about the bulls? Don't worry, I'll think of something. I'm the agricultural purchasing agent, goddamn. So what do you say? Can I count on you or what? We are Cheyenne! All right. This is my sister, goddamnit. Ain't gonna let no veho bastard lock her up. Gotta eat. Already? Oh man. A slice? Pie. Three cheeseburgers deluxe, two chocolate malts, and a cherry pie? He going into hibernation? Gimme a B.L.T and coffee. You know, Philbert, I've been meaning to talk to you about something... Hey, what are you two soggy fucks up to? Hey Buff. What are you doing here, Buff? Heading into Billings for a little tussie! It's Friday night, two weeks from Christmas. Hell, the bars will be crawling with fa la laing and horny little elves. Fine then, who the hell are you kidding, partner? Oh, hey Philbert. That's your shitbox outside? What'd you do, park it under a sprinter? Made a trade... I can't believe you rode in that thing. Here's your shake. Hey Betty, how about you and me go into Billings tonight, eh? In a pig's ass. Huge bitch, that Betty. Married to the cook. Ah, right. I'll see you around. Thanks. Philbert... The other cheeseburger's coming. I'm really worried about you. About what? I'm concerned with your appearance. If you wanna be a warrior, you gotta dress right. That's an essential part of the ritual. Huh? That Cheyenne? I've got no bread for buck's skin. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, maybe we could work something out. What about your pony? - My pony? - Yeah. Looks like shit. Rides like shit. It sounds... we don't have no music in the thing. Pony like that, what can you say? It ain't prepared for battle, that's for sure. Don't even have a goddamn AM radio. Shit. Here's your pie. Car radio. Car radio. Right this way, gentlemen. Now, I have a very nice Panasonic. It's an AM/FM in-dash, auto-reverse, got Dolby, and it's got a graphic equalizer. Well... Nah, what else you got? I'll tell you what. How about a break on a standard KID581. That's a one time price, it's good through Christmas. I ain't got but the three of these babies left. Smart fella would take one of these home, I gotta tell ya. Looks kinda cheap. Maybe something like this is what you're looking for. Plays cassettes, mono, take it to the beach. We'll take one of these. We'll take a couple of these turbo pro speakers, and one of these CBs while you're at it. All right. This is our most expensive stuff. It's top of the line. You don't understand. No get 'em special deal on this one, chief. Install them. Car's out front. Thanks. Woo! Yeah Phil, I gotta tell ya. You look good! Woo! Check that out! Yeehaw! Let's put on one of them tapes! Which one you want? That looks good. Let's fire this sucker up, see what she's got, get juice in there. Start her up, Phil. Okey-doke, let's see here. What the hell's wrong with that? Try this button there. That ain't nothing. Goddamn this country. What's the deal here?! 649 fucking dollars and it's a piece of shit! Look at that! The cheap fucking shit breaks off the minute you touch it! You think you're gonna get away with this, you asshole!? Well you ain't getting away! Hey! I want my goddamn money back! You sold me that cheap fucking shit! Don't even work! Hey wait there a minute. I'm gonna haul you out of here if you don't calm down. You! Open this register now! Open this goddamn register! You better open this register. You need to calm down for a second. You open this goddamn register or I'm gonna throw this through your... Uh-oh. Philbert! Philbert! Yeehaw! Hey, good buddy. Ten-four, uh. How you be? Do you copy? Hey, Cheyenne. It's Philbert Bono riding Protector the War Pony out of Lame Deer, Montana. Got a warrior name? It's, uh... Whirlwind Dreamer, but I'm not yet worthy. What's your handle? White Cloud, brother, running an 18-wheeler out of Sturgis, South Dakota. White Cloud, like the prophet? Right, man. Nobody ever picks up on that. Well, they should. He's like Jesus to the Cheyenne. Yeah, I know what you're saying, but nobody cares about history these days. Well I do. The other night on 'Bonanza, ' the Cheyenne chief... Well, he was a white actor. 'Bonanza?' That's not where you learned about the prophet? No, my uncle Fred. He told me about White Cloud. He tell you about? The sacred mountain where White Cloud got his power. Uncle Fred calls it "sweet butte," but I've never been there. Incredible man. Most powerful spot in South Dakota, maybe the world. You gotta go there, just straight ahead in the sun rise. You can't miss it. Hey White Cloud, White Cloud. White Cloud? It's not so big. Hey! You burning a barn? You're pissing on your tire! Hey. Hey. What tribe you all? Souix. So where you heading? Pine Ridge. Christmas Powwow. That's a long way from here. Uh-huh. I must've slept through Denver. I think he slept through last month. We're down by, um, by Pueblo, yeah? I've been on this road before. You been on acid, partner. Them are the Black Hills. What the hell? Woo! Woo! Holy fuck... Woo! Yahoo! Philbert! Philbert! Hi! We're supposed to be on the road to Santa Fe! In case you forgot, I got important shit coming down! Where are you guys going? Philbert, we don't have time to fuck around! Nobody grabs me no more! This is The most sacred place in America, maybe the world. We are gathering power. Hey, he know the scene? Where you going, brothers? Powwow over in Pine Ridge. Powwow? Mm-hm. Pine Ridge. Tonight? Yeah. Don't worry about Buddy. He'll be back. No way. That yahoo hot shit took our money and went on a drunk. You won't see him back in Laramie till the money runs out. Old Buddy, he'll be here. He'll help. No, I say you haul his crazy ass back here, because anybody else, that'd what you do. You treat him like he's something special. Listen, you quit worrying about Red Bow. Everyone knows he's got his own way of doing things. But he's done more for this tribe than anyone. Now you just load up them damn bulls and let's get going. Calm down, Sandy. Putting your sister behind bars was our best shot. It's completely unnecessary. I covered it all with the tribe. Environmental protection, sacred land issue, net profit participation. Sandy, you're missing the point. Red Bow's got a bunch of radicals on the loose up there. We need him off that reservation till the vote is in. You flew me all the way down from Montana to tell me this? The Bureau feels you underestimate Red Bow. Listen Jack, I really don't need the feds to do my job for me. Stupid doughboy. Would've killed me if I hadn't bounced off. Philbert, when we were kids, was I... What do you remember? Not much. You were always playing army games and football. But I remember Bonnie. Mommy! You've got five minutes. They got us in the slammer too. I know. Can't me and Jane stay here? I'll be out soon and we'll all go home together, okay? For now I want you two to take care of each other and stay close. And no fighting, okay? Okay. But there's nothing to do in that place. Yeah, nobody reads to us. I know. Listen, you two can help me get out of here faster. I want you to take this and I want you to call Rabbit. You understand? Cut the whispering. Tell him my bail is 2.000 and to come as soon as she can, okay? All right, let's go. My time isn't up. Yes it is. Move it. No! I love you. I love you. Don't worry about Mommy, okay? You two stay close. I'll be okay. - Move it! - Wait! Hey! You dumb shit! Freezing my fucking balls off! Hey, my first token! Good medicine. Well that's good, because I got fucking pneumonia. My friend Wolf Tooth lives around here in Pine Ridge. Pine Ridge, the powwow! Philbert, we gotta get out of these clothes! Pine Ridge. Powwow! Philbert. Whose that? Buddy Red Bow from Lame Deer, Montana. Buddy! Hey man, I almost blew your brains away. How you doing, man? All right. Wouldn't make much of a splatter though. What'd you guys do, swim from Montana? Yeah, I want you to meet my pal Philbert. This here's Wolf Tooth. Well, I ain't never met Philbert before, have I? You weren't in Wounded Knee with us, were you? Or Oglala? No, but I remember hearing about it. Imogene home? She's inside, c'mon, c'mon. We can't wait to get out of here. What, are you leaving Pine Ridge? Why? Miller's still got his gestapo running loose. They broke into my machine shop a couple days ago, wrecked everything. We can't take it anymore. There's a shooting a week, Buddy. It's like living in Belfast. What's this? That's yuppie bullshit. You sure don't want what comes outta the tap. Yeah, uranium lines have poisoned the White River from here to Cactus Flat. We're moving to Denver. It's gotta be better than this. Protector's going to Denver. We can give you a ride. You guys got room? Wolf. We got plenty of room. When do we go? After the powwow. Thank you. Hey, Phil, listen I'm gonna step outside... That's beautiful. What's on the rosette? It's my Purple Heart. I thought I'd put the old tin to some use. Should be proud of it. Wear it more often. Yeah, save me a place, will ya? Thanks. Have some more? Thank you. Just one more. Merry Christmas. I hear you're leaving. Yeah, thanks for destroying my shop, Miller. I didn't hear about that. What happened? C'mon Wolf, there's room for us on the bleachers. Go on. Your goons trampled my equipment. I don't like what you're saying. Mr. Miller. Good to see you again, man. Do I know you? Wounded Knee. March 1, 1973 behind a bunker. I tried to kick you in the balls, but you don't have any so of course you wouldn't remember. I guess that's it, eh? Get your hands off me! Let's go have a talk, Red Bow. Yeah! Why don't you stick around, Bull?! Next one might be lower! Let him go! Get out of town, Red Bow. All you sons of bitches are gonna rot in prison, just like your friend Peltier! That was great, man. Who threw that? All right! He was in Nam with Buddy and me. He got captured and spent 31 months in a tiger's cage. He finally escaped but had to slit four throats to do it. He's got just about every medal there is. M... M... Miller is f... f... full... full of shit! He is now, man. You just made him crap all over himself. Ay... Ay... Hey, man. Hey Jimmy, take it easy man. C'mon man, you don't gotta say nothing. Come on. Hey look it man, just think about lying on the grass, doing nothing, okay? Just think about being outside looking at the sky or something. Look, I gotta get out of here. C'mon, let's go smoke a number, eh? Dance. Man, I don't dance, you know? I hate these goddamn things. Look at these people, chirping around some basketball court. You think a few lousy beads and some feathers was a culture or something. N... No. You... You got mean. Take it easy honey, you're okay. We'll protect you. Take care of the girl, Rick. I'll hold them off. You can't hold them alone! Don't argue with me... Come on, Sky. Stay right there, I'll pick you! I thought you were an amateur. Oh, no! Trust me, I can do it. Do I have to? No! Could I have some of your popcorn? Are you an indian? Yes. Our mommy's an indian too. Oh, what tribe? Indian. Don't you know? Can I have some money for phone call? Indians should know their ancestors. Our mother's in jail. Could we please have our money now? You can call from over there. Thank you. I'll go see. Guard the phone, I gotta see what street this is. Rabbit? What tribe are me and Jane? Fort Robinson is around here some place. Oh, c'mon Phil. You can't trust a Nebraska storm, Phil. We've gotta keep moving. Why stop? Nothing's open anyway. Yeah. Oh, Jesus. What are you doing? It's a blizzard out there! C'mon, man! Philbert, come back! Close the window, Wolf. A token from the orphans. Here's 10 bucks. You pay for the gas. Hi. Can I have 10 hot dogs with lots of mustard and ketchup, a big bag of chips, and, um, a six-pack of Miller, and four ginger ales with ShastaPops, and, uh, better give me four coffees with lots of sugar, and some Chunky bars too. All ready to go, okay? Please, thanks. So with Wihio the Trickster, sometimes a man, sometimes an animal. But mostly he likes pulling antics and telling dirty jokes. One day, he saw some plums floating on the creek. Now Wihio loves to eat, so he reached for those plums, but they disappeared and he fell into the creek. He crawled out, all soaking wet, and saw them plums again, shimmering in the water. He kept diving, and they kept disappearing. Three days later, his wife found him still splashing around. "Woman!" cried Wihio "During the day, juicy plums float in this magical spot. But at night, they go away." His wife screamed at him. "Stupid dog of a dog! Those plums are still on the tree. You worthless fool of a husband chasing shadows while the truth hangs over your head." Then she hit him with a pan and took him home. Never did get any plums. Philbert, that was wonderful. Yeah man, you outta be tribe historian. Tell everybody fairy stories. Of how the old ones dealt with problems. Often the problems never change. Nor the people. Yeah, well it's just too bad those stories don't tell us how to keep our reservations from turning into sewers. But they do. Look, Phil... I don't mean to step on your show, but white America ain't gonna hold off much longer, man. They're hungry. They want our coal and our oil and our uranium, and they're gonna take it! Wherever it is. No they won't. Wihio the Trickster won't let them, for Wihio is also the creator of the universe. He will play a little trick on the white man. You wait and see. I'll be damned. Hard to believe you're moving here, Wolf. We're not moving here. You know, it's just temporary until we find a place to live. Heh, yeah right. What's the problem? It ain't no problem. You wanna start taking it easy in condo land, that's your business. Of course, back on the res, the fight is still going on, you know. I'm through bleeding for it, Buddy. I got a kid on the way. You wanna fight everyday of your life, you live in Pine Ridge. I had enough of that shit in Nam. Mommy, they're here! There they are. Hi, Imogene. Hi, sweetie. Hi, Donna. Hi Kathy, how you doing? Hey Keith, how you been? Looks like you two are doing fine here. I was about to call the highway patrol. This is Buddy and this is Philbert. Well, c'mon in. Uh, no thanks, we gotta hit the road. Oh come on, I fixed an enormous dinner. No, we're really in a hurry. Oh, come on. Come on, Buddy. C'mon, Buddy. We gotta get going. Oh Jesus, Philbert. Put some clothes on. Taking off, huh? Yeah. It's a long way to Santa Fe. Remember me to Bonnie, okay? Good luck, man. Yeah. Once the Comanche roamed these southern plains, but did these see these hills as extinct volcanos of another great age? You're gonna be one helluva help, you know that? All blissed out like this. We are Cheyenne. All the shit of the world could not change that. Do me a favor. When the heat comes down, don't start in with the old legends and all that mystical horseshit, okay? It'll only make things worse. Where's my caramel corn? How can you eat that crap? I'm hungry. Don't you ever think about your health? All you eat are carcinogen, you know that? Look at your diet, man. Sugar, grease, beer. Fucking preservatives up the wazoo! Here. I think your car ate the goddamn caramel corn. Ah! There's an arachnid in there the size of the Pentagon, man! A what? A goddamn huge hairy spider! I'll squash the mother. No! Shit! My gun! Trickster takes many forms. Look at my gun, Phil! That's fucking useless! We must keep our medicine good. Yeah, without a gun? Shit! Let me get this straight. You dump me on the side of the road to save a goddamn insect! Hey, look Buddy. Santa Fe. Sorry my pony threw you, Buddy. Howdy. I wanna bail out Bonnie Red Bow. Sorry, we're closed. I can take the bond but it won't be processed till after the holidays. Oh, come on. I got cash, can't you just put it through? Yes, I can take your cash, but her release has got to be approved. There must be someone I can talk to, like maybe your boss. Everyone's at our Christmas party, which is where I want to be. Goodnight Lucinda, Merry Christmas. Good night, Merry Christmas. Bonnie being in jail over Christmas, she's got kids. Could I at least see her? Please? All right. Wait here. Ah! Ah! Oh my God! What do you have got on? Look at you. I paid the bail but the can't process it or some damn thing till after the holiday. What do you mean? You know, same old bullshit. Some dumbass telling you what you can't do. Rabbit, you've gotta get me out of here. They've got Sky and Jane locked up... Go easy, honey. I've got the kids. And if this thing drags on, I'll stay with them. Thank God. So what's the story? I don't know. They're putting me through hell. Well honey, we waded through some deep shit before. I'll figure something out. This is really weird, Rabbit. I don't know what's going on. What the hell is that? Bonnie! Buddy? Hey, you! Get out of here! Get the hell out of my face, lady! Who the hell are you? Now get out of here! Back off, sarge! This is family I guess. I don't care if you're Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. You're out of here! You too! Out! We'll be back, Bonnie. Where's the phone? I'm gonna make a call. Get your hand off me, man! Just keep moving tough guy. Hey Buddy. Not now, Philbert! You too, big fella. C'mon Philbert, let's go! I gotta go take a leak. So, you're her famous militant brother. Who the hell are you? I'm Rabbit, the one who stuck by her while you were out saving the world. What, are you traveling incognito as a garbage man? Listen, why don't you go back to Texas or wherever the hell it is you came from? Me and my partner can handle this. Hah, right, I just saw how you peckerheads handle things. Yeah, well don't you worry your sweet little self about it 'cause we've got a plan. Oh, you think you are such hot shit. Bonnie told me nobody ever gave a damn about her when she was a kid. What? That's a goddamn lie. She said that? Goddamn right. Bonnie was always a pretty shy kid. Let's go get a drink, Phil. That's the first good idea you've had. Shit, sounds like a lot of fun and games over the last 10 years. Oh yeah, me and the feds go way back. And I'll tell you one thing, this whole business with Bonnie stinks. Stop worrying. Trust the powers. I trust my instincts, Phil. What the hell's Youngblood doing here? What? Sandy Youngblood, what's he doing here? Well I'll be goddamned. Wait, Buddy! Jesus. Jane and Sky, how could I forget about them? I will go get them. Where are they? They're at the El Dorado room 220, but I think I should go. I'll rescue the You know babe, back on the res, it's illegal to sell firewater to engines. I understand your confusion, but this guy does have red skin. Sometimes you gotta bite the apple to see the worms, I guess. You've been spending too much time in the sweat lodges, Red Bow. Take a bath. You're wasting your time, Sandy. You see, my red, it don't wash off. That's good, Buddy! That it? You son of a bitch! I know why you're in Santa Fe, I swear to God! -Buddy, c'mon! Let's get out, man! Ah-ha! You were fuckin' a, man! I would've done the same thing to that touch hole. Yeah, I bet you would've. Seriously, I think you could use a partner like me. I don't think I could handle both you and the feds coming after my ass. I think you could handle just about anything. Do you see Sky, to be a warrior you must have a medicine bundle. So you won't get sick? Different medicine. Sacred things that protect you from all harm. Four tokens that come to you in a special way. Are you Cheeyanee? We are Cheyenne. The awakening of the clear blue earth. I am Philbert now, but soon I will be Whirlwind Dreamer. So who's this uncle Buddy? He is my best friend. Oh great, the kid's ain't in their room and they ain't checked out. Don't sweat it, man. We'll find 'em. Well as soon as we do, I want you to take 'em and get the hell out of Santa Fe. Hey! My best friend and my two grand are locked up in that joint, and I ain't going anywhere till I get them both back. You're a real Texas twister, you know that? I know what I want. We should've rented a car. We have my pony. Your pony's an old nag. Quiet. Just because he told you all that warrior stuff. Shh. You must prepare for battle. You know what to do. Go. Bring the captive woman. He walks right up to you, knocks your stupid ass on the floor, and waltzes out of the place? The APB is out. Get the hell over here. We're putting a lid on. What's Sandy got? No balls, and a positive ID on Red Bow. Bartender said he came in with a Rabbit Layton and some fat guy. Beautiful, he's made fools out of everybody in Santa Fe. Listen, if you'd been straight with us from the beginning Mr. Novall, we could've nailed the guy on the spot. But no, you feds always gotta do things your way. Take that ridiculous hat off. Who the hell are you? I'm here to see Bonnie Red Bow. Hey idiot, stop right now! Sky? Mommy! This must be pretty important for a chief to come all this way. Sir, I'm here on tribal business. And you realize that Bonnie is in serious trouble? I just want to speak to her. Captain Roberts, would you please bring Ms. Red Bow to the visitor's room? Return that darn woman! Philbert Bono? Hey Bonnie! Help me. We'll tie up these bars with this rope and pull 'em out this fucking wall. You're kidding! No. By the way Chief, any men in your tribe about six foot, 300 pounds? No, must be Navajo. Faster Philbert, faster! Freeze, police! Goddamnit I said freeze! Wahoo! All right! It worked, told ya. Will you guys watch where you're going? Philbert! Philbert! Philbert! Ah! What'd you do? We can go now. How'd you do it? I pulled out the window. This is wild! I can't believe you came, Bonnie. We can believe it now baby, because we're here and we're gonna take you home! Uh oh. Open the door. It's stuck. Ah here, come on Protector. Get in, get in! Buddy Red Bull. Philbert. Now! Ah! Let's fly the hell out of here! All right, step on it Phil! Let's take the mountain road. C'mere you! I missed you. Wait a minute! Those fuckers got my 2000 bucks. That's right. Oh, no. I got money. You do? What? What? What's that? Philbert, what the hell? Phil, there's like thousands of dollars here. 4.000. Where'd you get it? At the vault in the jail. Ah! You got that at the vault? You just helped yourself to 4.000 bucks? Yep. Some for the bulls, some for rabbit, the rest for food. All right, woo! All right boys, let's cowboy up. We've got work to do. Hey drive faster Philbert. We need to pick up the pace here. C'mon. Protector is already galloping. I sure hope it dies before they cross into pueblo country. That heap will never make it up this mountain road. Relax, in five minutes we'll have them. Put it in low, man. We are in low. Goddamn this country! It ain't the country. Um, what do you think? Maybe we should get some backup? What's that? Phil? My brakes! You're kidding, right? Buddy, do something! Hey we've gotta get out, jump! What? We're not moving that fast. Take the kids and go now. Get out, jump clear of the car, and roll. Sky! Jump clear and roll, go! Go, get out! Rabbit, get out! C'mon Sky, let's go. Ah! Let's go, hey! Goddamnit Philbert, jump with him! My pony! Sky, come on! Whirlwind! Ah! Philbert! He was almost a warrior. Don't cry uncle Buddy. Yeah. You can forget that backup. It's all over. My pony threw me! And now he's dead. Philbert! Well I'll be damned. The third token! Philbert. Let's get out of here, c'mon. C'mon kids. This is yours. Be well, my brother.
