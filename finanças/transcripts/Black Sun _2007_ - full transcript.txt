The Black Sun a film by What are you doing? I'm looking at you. What are you looking at? Your eyes. They're closed, but they flutter. Where are they going? Looking for you, who aren't sleeping. But, if I sleep, I can't look at you... ...can't kiss you... But, if I'm sleeping, you can't kiss me anyway. Don't sleep, then. No... No, enough, I'm tired! You never stop! Hey, I wasn't serious! Hey! Manfredi! Manfredi! Do you hear me? I was joking. Hey, Manfredi! Can you hear me? What's the matter? Why? Why? Handsome! Sun! Archangel! Silence... Don't move... Let me stay like this. I'll be silent, won't move, if you want, but I'll speak to you... With my hands, with my arms, with my legs... Can you feel it? Come. I want a son, now! Handsome, a male like you, and then a female... ...with your eyes, but, also, with the color of your lips. Wait, wait, wait... Easy. Let's start with one... ...and see if it turns out like you want. Of course it will! You must do what I tell you, as long as I'm making it. Come here. Stay on top of me and don't move. I only want you... ...and no one else coming between us. Not a son, not a daughter... I do! Of course I want them... but not now! We haven't yet had enough of one another, Not yet. Now you only want me, but you'll have much more when I'll have our children... ...and I too I'll have more. I can't feel it yet... being... ...something more than your husband. You will... when it will have happened. You can't even imagine it now. Can you? Yes. - But I'm older... - No... I've waited it longer than you. You've waited it? - Then, you weren't waiting me! - I was! But I want more. - More... - It's too soon! Don't be stingy! Such a beautiful day! - I want you to look only at me. - I'd watch you for hours! But we do have to live... I've always thought I wasn't capable. What do I do, after all? I dream. That's what you must do! Dream and love me. That's all? We should have a goal, make projects. The projects never turn real. They do... because we are together. Fate will always be stronger than us. That's why I feel the need to give to others. I who have received so much... ...and have given so little! What are you saying?... You write wonderfully, that is your gift to others! I want us to have projects together. - How can one live without any project? - Loving. Just loving each other... .. like we do... - And having a baby isn't a project? - No. No! We can... ...only wait for what will be given to us: ...love, without thinking, like we do. Is it You who's sending me these horrible dreams? And, if they don't come from You, what do they mean? I don't even have the courage to talk about them with my confessor. But, if they come from You, I beg You, don't let them come true! Let me wait a little longer, will you? I must be careful, you know what I am risking. Don't let them catch you. So? Nothing. Come here... come on... Come. - But you won't hit me. - I won't hurt you. Come on, sit here. Come on! How come you never do what I ask you? You now go and bring me what I told you: heroin, morphine, everything you can find, understood? - D'you want to kill yourself? - Don't talk bullshit! You know I can't take it anymore, that this pain is killing me. Do what I told you. Go... And no arguing, right? Are you hungry? Thirsty? No. You? - Hungry! - What do you want to eat? Mm... something fresh, that melts in my mouth. I'll go to the greengrocer, I'll bring you some fruit. Send Porzia. She's back from church. She knows the stalls much better than you. But only I know what you like best. Never mind! I want to be with you all the time. - But that can't be. - Why not!? - Because no one ever succeeded. - We could. Not even the Siamese sisters. Did you read it? They took turns sleeping. One stayed awake, while the other one slept. I don't like it... even when we're sleeping. We are embraced... but we have different dreams. My love! I heard you speaking and I thought I'd bring you the coffee. Shall we have the coffee now? Don't know... Maybe we'll sleep a little longer. Let me, let me do it. My love, have you hurt yourself? No, it's... this thing... Let's try and meet in our dreams. But I want you alive, real! Dream of me and I'll dream of you. I don't want to sleep in the sun. You can sleep inside. Even if we are not close to one another... ...we can all the same dream of one another. Have I interrupted your dream? - Can I come in? - Yes, yes, come. Thank you, Porzia. Thank you... We were to meet in dream... ...and, instead, we were again separated. Have you brought it? There was no one. But you're better anyway... It's gone. I see you haven't done what I have asked you to, have you? No, I told him to come here. Take a brush. No, wait... I'll go back if you want. Wait... No! I'll go back! Do what I tell you, or get one. Clean the rifle! - You have fired it! - Yes, on a cat. Clean it well, it has to shine! How will we turn out? You'll speak less and less, always with your books... ...and I'll never stop talking. Still, I don't have to speak. We don't need words to talk to one another. All words to is dirty the silence. Hello? Yes... It was your mother. She asked if everything was alright. - Yes. Why? - She had nightmares... Nightmares? What nightmares? She didn't say. Poor mother! As for us, we know how to have beautiful dreams! - Should I wake you up when he comes? - No, no... As a matter of fact, go at the corner, keep watch and don't let him come near. They might follow him. Listen, whom did you tell I was looking for him? Down here, at the bar. I understand... Then go back there and tell him... ...tell him you made a mistake, you got it wrong, alright? There are too many cops... too many spies. Go. Salvo! I know you are there, open up! See you're there? I told you to open this door! Salvo, if you down settle your debts, no more new stuff for you, got it? Stop playing the clown! You're no good doing a cat. Anyway, I'll be back later, I must talk to you. Thank you. It's not good for Manfredi sleeping in the sun. He might get a sunstroke. If he likes it, I'll not play the guardian! That's not true: I'll be your guardian, and you'll be mine. Love is this. Porzia is right, the sun is too powerful. You brought him here. Now he knows I'm at home. No! I swear, I did nothing! Why don't you believe me? I'm your brother! Know something? I'm not even sure you're my brother. And remember: if you say one word, one, about what happened... ...you're dead. - But what happened? Nothing. That's all you must remember. Nothing... Manfredi!I know you're annoying me, but that's enough! You know you're torturing me? O yes?... I'll be going out, then. I don't fancy eating alone. Even better... Call your friend. The one who... asked me to dance at the reception. As you're sleeping you won't be jealous. I'm going! Daughter, daughter, daughter of love and pain... ...mother, mother, mother of love and pain... Death is vile... ...it spares the evil and strikes the good. A old man's death, who lived long and dies at peace... is an award. The death of a young man, not even yet bloomed to life... is a punishment. Not for him, who knows nothing, and will know nothing... ...but for the mother, for the wife... The death of a child... ...is God's folly. - Superintendent, the mother is here. - Hm... Madam, unfortunately I have to tell you... I already know what you want to say. I knew something must have happened. Do you already know how it happened? No. The investigation has just begun. What is that you know? Because... you said that... you already knew everything? D'you know anything, have you seen anything? Do you have any suspects? What could I know? I only know it was God who wanted it because... ...he had too much of an angel. "My dreams have come true", I thought... ...when I saw them at the altar. Now I know it couldn't have happened. You... have no idea who might have an interest in killing Manfredi? It was Satan. Of course, he acted through someone... ...but that is your concern, not mine. Satan? Yes, and if you don't believe Satan exists... ...then you know nothing about this world. Madam... soon. Agata will come to herself and we'll have to interrogate her. She's the only one who can give us clues about the motive... - About the murderer, if there is one. - What d'you mean "if there is one"? Yes, it might have an accident, a stray bullet... We can't exclude that. This death, so mysterious... it's an enigma. - Superintendent? - Yes. - She has come to herself. - Ah! Then, I can go in. Please, have a little more patience. The forensics must finish their work. - So... is she better? - Yes, but don't tire her too much. So... Agata, right? Listen, Agata, I... I... must ask you a couple of questions. I understand that the moment... is not the right one, but... ...we must be quick. Have you seen anything, heard anything? No. But, if... Manfredi goes away... ...if they take him away, I must go with him. But... this is not possible, madam. - What d'you mean is not possible? - Well, no... - Wait. Well, yes. We can't ever separate, for all our lives and beyond. - We promised ourselves. - Madam, your husband... Has had a sunstroke. - Doctor! - Madam! Where's he? Manfredi! - Stop, stop... - Let me go! Take her like this... Doctor! Hold her fast! There's no exit wound. The shot was fired from a considerable distance. The bullet followed an oblique, upward... ...trajectory, the entrance point is angled. Death was instant, he had no time to realize it. He went from sleep... ...or, I could say, from the dreaming he was making, that must have been very beautiful, seeing that death left a smile on his face. No other sign of a wound. The subject is an adult male, in his 20s, with proportions that remind more of Phidias than of Lysippos. Yes, we can conclude he is... ...he was... a young man of a remarkable physical beauty. You should have listened to me... ...and stayed with your unblemished skin, and not tried to change. I should have compelled you to go back inside. It was the sun... It was a sunray that hit you, jealous on your beauty! Handsome, valiant! Exquisite figure! An easy talker with a proud gaze... They hurt you treacherously! You don't have a mother to weep for you. You were more than a son to me. The eyes turn to stone. No more tears have I in my heart. Today it's your turn, tomorrow of whom murdered yo. It's a chain of blood and death. In their eyes... never shines the hope, always the darkest fear. It's the earth that condemns them! It's the earth that feasts on blood! Blood must fall on the head of whom killed you, blood! There can not be forgiveness. As you don't remember... ...if you fainted before or after we don't know what... ...a murderer will walk. What if I remembered? What would then happen? Well, what will happen is... we'll arrest him. And then? Then... he'll stand trial and a judge will condemn him. Or acquit him. It can happen, of course, sometimes, after three or four trials, In this case, with your testimony... ...they'll condemn him for sure. My testimony? How many won't he find saying they were with him, a that hour, on that day, the day before, the day after? But, let's admit they'll condemn him. Then what happens? - He'll go to prison. - For how long? - How long? - Yes. A century? Two? For how long? That's hard to say... With our laws... with pardons amnesties, good behaviour... - But he'll do seven, eight years for sure. - Seven, eight years? For an angel’s life? For my life? For our lives? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Can I help you? - Well... Excuse me... can I help you? Is anything wrong? You know, we're very discreet It's in our tradition. Are you by any chance looking for a pregnancy test? D'you want me to show them to you? The result... is on the spot? It depends on when the intercourse took place. If it's at least one month old, the result is immediate and reliable. And if only... one week went by? Well, no, then you'd need a more sophisticated test. And, anyway, you should go to a hospital. They fired from here, from one of these houses. If you're telling me that: you catch him and leave him on the ground... ...as he... Then, maybe, I might remember something. If not the face, a glance... something... ...but, for seven, eight years, I can't remember anything. What would you want, arrest him and then kill him? How can you imagine this, Agata? D'you take your work seriously? What kind of justice is this? Seven, eight years for a life? That's true, there's no balance... ...but even with an eye for an eye there isn't any; it's a fake balance. Evil engenders irreparable... ...damage. This attempt of ours to establish an impossible order... ...has its reason of being. Agata... don't help perpetuate this disorder yourself! If you know something, you must say it! I want to see Manfredi. For this you need the judge's permission... ...and an opinion from the psychologist. I'll ask permission. Alright, I'll try to help you. But you must help us. You'll look over this photos? I will. They tell me you are no more. You've had to leave suddenly. You had to hide? Yes, stay in hiding, my love. I know you're thinking at me as I'm thinking at you. Even if you're far away... ...you're close to my breast. Don't be scared I'm keeping you in darkness, my little one... Darkness is healing you. It's the light that hurt you. Agata! My child, what are you doing? Talking to yourself? - No, mother. - With whom, then? Who's there with you? Manfredi, mother. Who else? What are you saying, Agata? Stuff the two of us know. You can't go on like this, staying closed in here, talking to yourself. - I'm talking to my husband! Honey, your husband is dead, you should accept that. And you must cry, if not your blood will become poisoned. Why should I cry? He's here, with me. My child, I'm crying. I'm crying for both of us. Mother, you shouldn't cry. I'm not mad! Tomorrow I'm seeing the psychologist, who'll confirm it. One doesn't speak with someone who's gone! But he is here... I can now see more things than the others. Is the light bothering you? Should I draw the blinds? No, thank you, I like light. Alright. How are you feeling, Agata? In order to allow me to see my husband you want to know... ...if I'm capable to understand he is dead... right? Following similar shocks, distancing from reality does happen... ...and, in some cases, it even is the safe thing to do. But if you, as you're telling me, understand he's dead, that should prevent you from talking to him as if he were present, right? - My mother told you that. - Yes. Talking to someone you were in love with, are in love with, can that be the symptom of a mental illness? No, not necessarily. - But it can be the signal of a disorder. - Ah. So... ...whoever prays to the saints... ...all those praying to the saints, are sick people... ...including my mother. Those are different circumstances. Do you believe your husband is a saint? Who are the saints? The absolved ones, sinners God has forgiven. Manfred was forgiven. Alright. If the judge consents, you can see your husband's body. Meet... We meet those we love, we don't just see them. I don't want you to come, I want to see him alone. I too loved Manfredi very much. That's different. You can go afterwards. If need still be. I'm afraid for you. You should be. I am, too. Everyone should be afraid of himself, because no one knows what one is capable of. Still... what could happen to me there? What are you afraid of? That I faint? - Rest assured! It's a hospital. - You're weak! As a matter of fact... ...the more my hope grows, the tougher I become, and that is what scares me. Hope for what? Now it's not the time, mother. - So? - Nothing. There are no other? There are, but I don't know if I can show them to you. - Why not? - Because there's something I don't get. What? I don't understand you... Agata: at first, a wall, and now... ...all this interest, this attention, this urgency. Don't you want to catch my husband's murderer? - Sure we do. - What is it you don't understand? I too want the one that did this to be punished. Alright... ...even if the evil... ...can't be eliminated... ...because it is the good that engenders it, as a contrast. Talking like this could be seen as dangerous because... ...it means admitting that even the evil can engender the good. But in all these years I've never such a thing happening. But this is a digression. I understand what you mean, I really do. Show her the others photos. No. No... Could you go back, please? It's him? It was him? Have you recognized him? No. No... I don't remember. Why this reaction, then? - It looked like, but it isn't. - Looked like what? I told you I don't remember anything! This kind of music won't get you not even a dime... ...that is if they don't pay you to stop. It doesn't matter how I play... ...what matters is for the police to think I can live from it. This way they'll be off my back. And then? Then? And then and then and then... I'll start living again. Of what? - Think about yourself. - What should I do? Steal. And, if you don't know to steal, work. You're healthy, it's time for you to start making money. You were healthy once too. True... I'll never be now. And that's why I'll have my revenge... ...even on you. But what is my fault? None. Neither have I. Whose fault is it, then? His. Because he doesn't exist. A gale blew away for ever our love. To me it has now returned. I'll keepsake them both, your love and my love. Locked inside of me. Leave me alone! I want to go alone! You are interfering, mother, but I'm no longer living in your house. I have a husband! It seems to me you no longer understand things any more. You think I am mad? You're right, I'll go mad, if you don't leave me alone! As I don't seem to be of any help, I'll go away after the funeral. Have I offended you? You can't offend a mother. Don't worry, I won't come late. D'you like it better? I was sure. I'll be right away. - No, no, let me. - No. It's against the rules. We'll make an exception. Look, the body is frozen, one needs practice. And strength. Listen, leave me alone with my husband. Manfredi! I'm here, I've come. Why aren't you answering? Why are you annoying Mei? Eh? It can't be you! It isn't you! Because otherwise you would answer me. It isn't you. It isn't you! It isn't you... Because you are... ...inside of me. You are inside of me. That's why you aren't answering. But I can feel you! I can feel you, my love! No, no, no... This shirt won't do. I have another one. Three days left to the funeral, I'll find you another tie too... Three days left... Yes. I'll bring another tie. So?... D'you recognize anyone of the ones? No. - The one in the middle? - Who's he? He's a man... a very bad man, a fallen angel... ...used to study music when he was young. Maybe, had he not fallen sick, ...he might have made it out of the misery he was born in. Another man, in the same circumstances, could have become a saint. - Is he the one? - I don't know. Why are you so indifferent? That is not normal. Don't you want to see the guilty condemned? The guilt exists, but it won't be the fair punishment. Some inmates repent, they should be given this opportunity. Evil is paid by the suffering of the perpetrator not of the victim. Who repents, suffers... ...but those you let free almost never suffer! It's not us that leave them free, it's the tribunals, right? Anyway, I can't accuse no one this way way, lightly. And then, I'm not sure this is the right way. What do you mean? I don't understand. If there is a guilty and Manfredi is dead for ever... ...eight years in prison mean nothing! But if Manfredi is still alive, forgiveness is an option. Agata, Manfredi is dead. He's dead! Alright, you take her come... ...it's too dangerous letting her leave with the others. Dangerous? Why? They might try to take revenge... ...even if only because they were suspected. True, there also exists the vendetta, besides punishment and forgiveness. Is there a place for the vendetta in your system? Follow that man on the bicycle. - D'you see him? - Yes. - He mustn't notice us, alright? - Will you wait for me? - Alright. - Thank you. Agata, are you ready? What're you doing? We were late at the wedding, we can be late at the funeral. What happened? What did you do to your feet? - No, I won't put this one. - What will you put on then? This. It's alright at a funeral. Did you know there are countries... ...where the colour for morning is white? - But here no one will understand! - God will. Manfredi would understand. I don't care about the others. But the others will mind. When she rose, when she resurrected... ...she didn't weep, she didn't cry... ...nor did she ask her husband... ...if she was all dressed in white, just like a bride... ...and she laid down facing the window... ...waiting for him to come back. Seven days and seven nights she slept. Slept she? For seven days and seven nights dead was she... ...and then she resurrected. Better had she stayed closed eyes... ...closed the eyes, tightened the lips, heart of stone. Our brother Manfredi has gone to his rest in Christ. Receive his soul... ...and present him to God the Most High. Receive his soul... ...and present him to God the Most High. The grief of our separation... is tempered by the hope of seeing him one day into the light... ...when we will all be resurrected with our bodies. Receive his soul... ...and present him to God the Most High. Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, ...and let perpetual light shine upon him. Amen. - Agata! - Madonna! She's not well! - Call an ambulance. - Right away. Let her breathe! Nothing serious: a malaise similar to the previous one. - Doctor, I want to be alone with you. - Sure! Please... Ehm... I'd like to take a pregnancy test. That could explain everything. When did the intercourse take place? - The same day. - You mean the day of death? - Yes. - It'll take a couple of days. Were you praying for Manfredi? I'm praying the murderer is punished. Manfredi... ...is in Heaven by now. Better pray he goes on living here. He should have been buried earlier! Never was a dead man seen to wait so much for the funeral. There where he is now... ...time doesn't matter. - Eh... Still, until we buried him, has wandered. He was coming to see you? Eh? That's why you are like this! Agata! You must not talk to the dead! I should have warned you. - Salvo... - Police. Open! Tanino... - Where's your brother Salvo? - How should I know? He's not here. Tell him to give himself up, it's better for everyone. - But why? What did he do? - You don't know? No.. I know nothing, I swear. And then... he doesn't push stuff anymore. You tell him we're looking for him. But I don't know where he is! Sure... If you did meet him... - Good morning, how are you? - Well. Better. But a lot depends on what you'll tell me. I realize it. To be honest... I don't know if for you it's bad or good news. The test is negative. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I won't be able to talk to you anymore, you know? You're dead. You were buried. Child who could have been born, unborn child, dreamed child... I'm rocking you inside of me. No, not even this! Had you left me a child... ...I'd have drained the venom from my veins. I'd have loved you in him... ...and you'd have loved me! The child of forgiveness, of hope. - What're you doing here? - Am I bothering you? You live here? No. - Are you lost? - No. I like walking in lonely places. It helps me staying alone with my thoughts. I like solitude too. But, on the contrary, I do it to escape my thoughts. And can you do that? - Are you going hunting? - Yes, sometimes. But today there's nothing left. I use it at work. What kind of work? Let's say I am a kind of a keeper and of a hunter. You like shooting? - It depends. - On what? Of the mood I'm in. Did you know it's dangerous walking around here alone? - That's why you keep your rifle close to you! - Always. I'm sorry having bothered you. What are you looking for? - Who was that one? - One who got lost. Well? They're looking for you. - Who's they? - Not the ones you think. - The police. - The police? Why not the army? What the fuck's the matter with them? - What did you get into, Salvo? - Mind your business. They came twice to search the house. What were they looking for? That? What did you do, Salvo? I told you, I took out a cat. Listen, why have you come? They could have followed you! - I was careful. - Go, now. If I need you, I'll call you. What if I need to tell you something? You've told me what you had to. There's something else I want to tell you. What? I brought this. I thought you might need it. Weren't you the one saying I couldn't play? Well... if you don't want it... - I could use it. - You? What for? Didn't you say I had to earn my living? Break it. - What? - You heard me, go on. Do what I told you. Break it. But why, if you don't need it? Because this is not work, is not life! Come on! Now! Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Agata needs you. Agata doesn't need me anymore. No one can do anything for her anymore. Porzia, you stay close to her. All the clues we have lead us to him. I haven't seen any one of them, I've already told you. I'm not interested in your justice. I've understood that, but maybe you could help us. The suspect has disappeared, and nothing was found in his home... ...a reason, a connection, a motive... ...maybe you could suggest something. He and Manfredi had they ever met before? Try and remember! - Can I take this? I'd like to keep it.. - No, no... It must stay in the file. D'you think you'll call me again? Every time... ...there'll be new facts in the inquest... Anyway, if you remember anything, tell us right away. Of course, Superintendent. - We're always here. - Goodbye. Father... ...if one dies murdered, does go to hell? Only if he's committed a mortal sin. And if he's innocent as an angel? Of curse not. He goes to paradise. And if... ...on the contrary... ...one... commits suicide? Why are you asking me this question? If one... ...commits suicide out of love, out of love despair. It can't be a sin. Life is sacred! Just because life is sacred, and someone has had it taken away from him, and I want to be with him, must I wait? - And how much? - What are you saying? Are you mad? No, Father, you're wrong. There must be exceptions. God understands. What exceptions are you talking about? You must be able to tell right from wrong, and what you're saying, what you're thinking is wrong. Where does this evil I have inside come from? Evil exists and that's it! What're you trying to make me say? It's not like you say. Who can know... ...what is wrong and what is good? - He knows. - Only He! One never forgets a client like your father. He was an excellent hunter. We used to quarrel because of that. I wanted no one to be killed, human or beast. Now I know it can't be this way. This is what you have asked. Tell me the truth... ...you weren't convinced I'd be able to transform... ...the bullet you brought me into a new cartridge, were you? - Where're you going at this hour, dressed like this? - I'm leaving. What do you mean you're leaving? Porzia, when you come back from mass, go on rearranging. - Hm... - There're letters on the bedroom table. - Please send them for me. - Alright. I will. Wait... only with your bag? I don't need any luggage. Agata... - Should I wait for you? - No, thanks. What do you want? You came back... Why? It's... beautiful here. Beautiful?... What d'you find so beautiful in here? The nothingness. Then it's the nothingness that attracts you. Or is it something else? Listen... I don't know what you're looking for... ...but it's better you go away, or I... Are you afraid of a woman? Oh! Fear! You'll see, you'll like it. I only need one, anyway, I only need one... To kill me? You've killed people, eh? How many? - One? Two? - I can't remember. Many. Who? - What's it to you? - I like it. They're only names. How did you kill them? It was my duty. Ah, you just do it out of duty... No. No, no, no... One... - One I killed out of pleasure. Out of justice, even. - Who? Who? I don't know, some guy... He was lying down in the sun. One who had everything from life. - What had he done to you? - Nothing. That's why you killed him? For nothing? - He offended me. - How? I was suffering like a dog, while he was lying happy in the sun. Only for that? Eh? You think that's nothing? Do you find it fair? Fair? You killed him just because he was happy. Like a dog. Enough playing now. Come on, give me the keys. D'you know who I am? No, I don't fucking know. And now give me those fucking keys! I am... the wife of that guy sleeping in the sun. Give me these fucking keys! You can shout... - No one can hear you here. - What do you want to do? What the fuck do you want to do? D'you want to leave me die here? I beg you, set me free... Set me free! Set me free! I beg you, set me free! I beg you... ...set me free... You're begging me? Did you give Manfredi the time to beg? You killed him and my child. What child? The child I couldn't have. Shoot! There's no need, this is not for you. Salvo! Salvo! God is infinite and all powerful... If he is all powerful, He can create a God more powerful than Him... Evil tires and leaves the field to good... God is infinite goodness and omnipotence.
