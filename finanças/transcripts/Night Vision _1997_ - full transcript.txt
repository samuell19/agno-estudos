One's for good luck. Bad luck. No luck. We'll see what you are, pal. What the fuck do you want? What the hell? I mean, we ain't doin' nothin'. Hey, pops. I gotta do her on my Harley, man. Ha. You haven't done that? Well. Friend of mind did once. He was goin' 120 miles an hour when he came. He lost it. - She did. In a screaming, clawing mess. They die? In a bloody ecstasy. Wait minute now, but how do you know all of this if you was... Hey, hey, hey. It was on the radio man. Her ass was on the gas tank and her cheek was pressed up against the butt. How do you tell when an alcoholic is lying? How? - His lips are moving. Missed you at the meetin' a while back. What meeting? - The Alcoholic Anonymous. Yeah, yeah that meeting. - Full moon out there. Strange things can happen. Yeah well, that makes for better night vision. Hey, have you seen her on TV? Julie Paulson. - The newslady? Every day, six o'clock. - Happy birthday Dak. Yo, Harley. - Hey. Don't call me Harley. I'm your watch commander and if there's a beer in this sack... Root beer. You've betrayed the body God gave you. Don't try telling us you're sorry. It's too late to repent. A little off the top? Haven't had one of these in a long time. Meet the new chief yet? - Naw. You're gonna love him. He screams when he talks to ya. Got a PhD in efficiency. Call him The Undertaker. He's a friend of Mahoney's. So what? You got bad knees. Your file's as thick as your dick. They pay ya three times what they pay a rookie. I'm worth it. - Dak. You're an ex-detective on a motorbike. Shit sinks and this is bottom. Screw you with all respect, sir. - You got one chance. You got one chance only. Yeah, I know. Low profile. It's a state of mind, Dak. Say it again. Low pro file. Happy birthday. You won't be needin' these anymore. Hello base. This is Officer Smith. Makin' a stop on a black van. May need backup. This guy's got heavy artillery. What the hell? Holy shit! This is Chopper One. We got us a player, here. I'm backin' off. All right, let's go for it. - You crazy? Yeah. Go in low. Go in right behind him and he won't see you. Get down right behind him. God, I hope you got that! - No. Just kidding. What a mess. This looks like Smith's bike, but he ain't around. Just go check the nearest bar. Hey, hey! Come back here! Get out the way. Make a little room here. Make a little room. Come on, get up, buddy. You don't wanna miss your breakfast, do ya? Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell it to your congressman. The top story at this noon hour. The reign of terror continues. The body of Elizabeth Richards, the 13th victim of the Video Stalker was found outside our Channel Six news building this morning. Inside sources reveal that she may have been shot by a stray bullet from the gun of police officer Dakota Smith. A video cassette was found on Richards' body containing footage of intimate moments of lovemaking, phone conversations and diary entries. The question on everybody's mind at this time is how does he do it? How does he invade the lives of his victims so completely and what can we do to protect ourselves? Thank you, Julie. And we'll be back after these messages. We're here to pick up Officer Smith's personal effects. For what? - 'Cause he's a dead asshole. Come on. Yeah, it's open. Stinks in here. They're lookin' all over the highway for your ass. Mahoney bet his watch commander he was shacked up with a case of beer. Root beer. - Smells like you died in here. He and Mahoney used to be partners. And Mahoney is now chief detective and look at you. Fix you some coffee? Do you wash your rubbers out, too? Naw, your mama told me she was fixed. The van last night, the Video Stalker. - With number 13 inside. First solid contact we get with this guy ever and you don't call for back up, you do get off a shot and who do you hit? The girl. Right in the forehead. Damn, you're good. What are you sayin'? Ballistics matched the bullet to your gun. What is this? Put that down. I'm turnin' this in. Internal Affairs shoulda had this weeks ago. Let him go. Take the shot. Do you wanna play chicken? Next time you draw down on me, you better use that thing. Excuse me. Aren't you the new transfer they call Quick Draw McGraw? And you're Dirty Harry, right? That's good, that's real good. You know, just for the record, if it was me, I'da done the same thing. Yeah, but it wasn't you. Come on. What's the big deal? So you shot the scum. People like that deserve to be off the street. Low profile? Lost a hundred bucks on you. Amnesia. Try this for your amnesia breath. Nah, nah, nah, you got it wrong this time, coach. I'm on a root beer diet. - Yeah? Your ex-wife called. She was lookin' for insurance money. I told her we haven't got a body yet. She said see that, son of a bitch. Never there when you need him. - Why should I be? You know I wanted you to know that I'm behind you on this. It wasn't my idea to put ya out on patrol. Internal Affairs decided rather than suspend you they'd put you on probation on my turf 'til the incident's been investigated. I understand. Yeah, well you know how it is. They have to investigate why the victim had no gun on him when you shot him. I didn't know. He made a movement as though he was reaching for one. Yeah, yeah, you're dismissed, Officer. I was sure he was dead. He was my partner, I know him. You don't know crap except how to save your own tail. You never let go, do ya? You came in late, you blew out your own kneecaps, you blame everybody else. You let him take your piece. - And if you'd have taken a shot... All right, all right. Screw you. A drunk's response to everything. I want a report on that van stop. You need my help on this one. - Call 9-1-1. What is it with you two? - He's like a pit bull with a hard on. Never mess with a hard on, Mike. We'll see. Get me that report. Excuse me. Could you help me make a copy? Of what? - Your gun. So, I hear they call ya Quick Draw McGraw. So, what do you say, Quick's Draw? Let's you and me play a game of whip out. Bet I can whip mine out faster than you can. Hey, wait a minute. - Ho, ho, chill out, chill out. Chill out. - Hold it, hold it, that's enough. But he didn't do anything. - All right, take it easy. Johnson grabbed her ass, Bigelow offered to whip out cock. No, he didn't. All right. He didn't do anything. He didn't do a thing. He didn't do anything. Smith, Taylor, I wanna talk to you guys in my office right now. I guess a blow job's out of the question. Bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit. Is Officer Dakota Smith around? Thank you. Dr. Harley? I been expectin' your body. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you. You all right? - Maybe. Sometimes I'm not quite sure myself. Try meditation. Extensive cirrhosis of the liver. Damn. You saved her from a horrible death. He likes plastic wrap on the face. They suck it in their mouths, their nostrils, even their eye sockets, and rigor mortis sets in. This liver, it's from drinkin'? Would you get that for me? Yeah, morgue. - Officer Smith, please. Okay, you got him. - You really piss me off. Come on, come on, chill out, okay? I sent the check. It's in the mail, trust me. You don't know who this is, do you? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know who it is. It's my ex-wife's lawyer, right? We met last night. You killed a passenger in my van. What do you want from me? I'm gonna teach you humility. Yeah, right. How you gonna do that? - Trust me. Sure. Dakota. Dakota Smith. Yo, what's up? - They found your 12-pack. Thanks, man. - All right. Hey look,. Come on man, I'm sorry, all right? Sorry, sit down, Dak. You know somethin', man? I really loved your father. And when you needed help, you came to me. But I'm tellin' you right now, man, you break one more of my rules and you and your stuff are on the street. Deal? Okay, all right. What is that? These are tapes from the video store. Hey, Newt, is that you out there listenin'? No, sir. So tell me, have you got a sponsor? No. Well, then. How many sober days have you strung together? 29. - How many? 16. - Come on, man. How many? - Nine. Right. So. How is your life? It's okay. Really? - And what have you got left? Your Harley? Maybe. Tell you what. How 'bout one meeting a day for 90 days? A toothbrush? I already brushed. Yeah, a few of them video tapes I heard been sold commercially in Europe, and a few of them are right here on the streets. Professional? Naw. Poor quality. Copies of copies. But I know some guys that used to be in the porno business. I could holler at them about it. - Well, that's good work, man. Get on it, all right. Newt, Newt. My man, I need some help here. Call 9-1-1. I'm busy all right? I'll holler at you. Cool. Is Officer Smith up here? Yo. Officer Dakota Smith is a former detective. What are you doing? Community service. - It's a shitty job, but... You stopped the stalker last night. He's probably watching. Is there anything you'd like to say? - Yeah, thanks for the call. The Video Stalker called you? Yeah, we have a common interest. - Like what? He's sick. He wants to die, and I'm gonna help him. He's sick. There's a little surcharge on this job. What are you talkin' about? Garibaldi paid for this. It's goin' with us. Garibaldi doesn't have anything to do with this. This is a little something between us. So, what are we talkin'? This skid row cop, Dak, is on me like a pit bull. He's almost as crazy as I am. I don't mind playin' cat and mouse with him, but I think it's time to change the rules. So, you want us to off him? That would be too easy. I said I wanna change the rules, not end the game. Well, I'm not too much on games, so, just tell us what you want. I want to make him suffer. He has an overactive conscience, so work over one of his buddies and tell him to tell his friend, his good friend, Dak, that he better get outta this while he still can. Start with this guy. He owns a liquor store. You better know what you're talkin' about. This could be fun. Be on the lookout for a dark van, military weapons. I know you already know this, but we need to find out where he gets his info. He somehow knows those little secrets that people like to keep private, so, if you happen to spot it, don't be a hero like Smith, here. Call for backup. Good news, bad news. Good news, our new officer, Kristin O'Connor. Bad news, her partner will be Dakota Smith. What? - That's right. You're gonna be riding shotgun for O'Connor. It's O'Connor who's gonna need a shotgun. All right, that's it. Go out and do your jobs and keep your radar turned on for that van. Dismissed. Come on, man. What is this? What are you talking about? I'm a cycle cop, I work alone. Not anymore. I'm puttin' you in a patrol car. But I don't want her, I don't need her. Dak, would you cut it out with that hurray for me and everybody else is an idiot attitude? You do need her. I'm tellin' ya. Take it from a friend. She'll do you some good. Yeah, right. Happy birthday, yesterday. Yeah, I've had a few. You're younger than you look. It's probably the drinking. - What is this? You're my partner, now you're my psychiatrist, too? I mean, how do you know all this? I read your file. I got it out of the computer. It took half a box of paper to print out. Yeah, you mean you know how to do all these things? You work computers and all this stuff? Yeah. Well, look. I need some information on Mahoney from the Task Force files. You think you can help me? I'm on probation, I have you as a partner. How many strikes do I get? Okay, all right. Where we going? - Gonna watch a sex video. You like sex, don't ya? - With the right guy. So, I guess you're kinda particular, right? Very. There's a VCR in here. Jesus. What is it? - It's a AA meeting. Are there any other newcomers with less than 30 days? My name is Dak. - Hello, Dak. I'm an alcoholic. I almost had a slip the other day, but I have three days of sobriety. How do you feel? I'm thirsty. Thanks for your support. I need it. Well, you got it, buddy. The life and death of a slut. The story of a woman who loved to bang studs. At what age does a slut first become a slut? Look. Look how scared she looks. It's an act. She wasn't scared when she was screwing around on her husband. She really enjoyed it. I know that now. Touching, isn't it? This guy's sick. Yeah. How sweet. She's so religious. This must be her new husband. No, wait a minute. I've seen her husband and that's not him. This looks like that guy from work. She couldn't get enough of this stud before. How does he know this stuff? No wonder she said her husband couldn't fulfill her needs. She said he really just needed a friend. They look friendly, don't they? Don't worry, Mr. Richards. I'll look out for you. Tell me where it hurts. Can I help you? - That depends. On what? - What I want isn't in here. I need to send a message. Try Western Union. Real smartass? Look, do you wanna buy something or not? Now that I have your attention, I need to send a message to your buddy, the skid row cop. All units respond. - Is that an alarm? Sounds like it. - Lexington and State Street. That's Tom's place, let's move. - Right. What the fuck you do that for? - He really pissed me off. What about the cash? - That's not what we came for. We're outta here. I'm gettin' the cash, man. Let's go man, we're fuckin' outta here. You check inside. I'll go that way. Freeze, bitch. Drop it, cop. Go ahead, take the shot. He ain't got the balls. - Take the shot. Don't touch. - Why not? Could get ya killed. You took the shot! You told me to take the shot. - You took the goddamn shot. I got brains all over me. He's dead. Yeah, for what? Few lousy bucks? Looks like they wanted more than that. They beat him up pretty badly. Have you known him long? Three sober lifetimes. Check out back. Call this low profile? Hey. We got a dead one over here. One got away. Have you been drinking? Get the hell outta here. Go file your report. It's open. Hey, yo, another cop to see you. Nice ass. - Please. You want a Twinkie? It's in the refrigerator. Maybe later. I just wanted to say thanks for last night. - All right. Want a root beer? - Goodbye, Newt. I got the deal on the chief ravioli. He's the porno king. What kinda friends you got, man? Some ghetto soldiers that got all the tight info. - All right. Stay on it, bro. - All right. Yo diggity, I'm out. Yours? - No, it's my dad's. He was a detective for Metro? Yeah. One night while he had been drinking and he was on stake out, somebody sneaked up behind him and slit his throat. Yeah, I heard about that at the academy. I'm sorry. You know, Dak, with all your drinking, are you afraid you're gonna turn out just like him? Naw, naw, naw, no way. I'm not gonna check out of here until I have a loving weekend with you on my Harley. You must believe in miracles. Well, a man gotta believe in somethin'. Tell you what. You get a 90-day chip, and we'll do it. Face to face? Belly to belly. 30 days. - 90. 60? Done. Done. Here we go. Somebody's been here. Yeah. Feels like he's here. - Yeah. Camera was probably there. And this is where she was praying. Hello, Detective Dak. - It's him. What are you looking for, Dak? I'm like God. I'm everywhere. Do you believe in God, Dak? Hello, Quick Draw. I didn't recognize you without your gun. Go blow yourself. - Well, that would be delightful but for now, please press play on the VCR. The life and death of, must have forgot that part. Maybe it's on the closing credits. Before the fall. Sweet, innocent. If only her mom could see her now. She's had five different lovers this year alone. Actually, her mom's probably a harlot, too. She tells me things, like how she uses these guys to pay her bills. She's betraying them. - I would never betray her. Might kill her, though. Dak, you're so clever. Ouch! What time you have, Dak? 10 minutes after six. You have four hours to find her. She alive? - Yes. Her name is Allison. - Allison what? You have three hours and 58 minutes. Listen, this is between me and you. Why involve Allison? Allison is my friend. I know what she thinks, what she feels, what she does. Every intimate detail. Only you can save her. How do we find a girl by the name of Allison in four hours? I don't know, I don't know. TV news? Julie Paulson? That's a good idea. All right, we'll go with it. We interrupt this program to bring you a special emergency bulletin. Good evening, I'm Julie Paulson. The Video Stalker and the Skid Row Cop have had further contact, a kind of game in which a young woman may soon be dead. Channel Six has learned that in a telephone conversation with Officer Dakota Smith, the stalker pledged to strike again tonight. The police have provided us with photographs of a man and a woman the stalker may be targeting as his next victims. If you know the identity of this woman or this man... Get me to a phone! I know that guy. - At this moment we know very little. Handsome devil. - What we do know however, is that the name of the woman in this photograph may be Allison. We also... Okay, people, we're back two minutes. Let's go now. Could I talk to you for a minute? You son of a bitch. You don't go through channels. You don't go through procedure. You just go on the air like you're a one-man police force? Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cop, same as you, okay? Now, you've had this case for 18 months. Now, we outta time, partner. What do you mean, we're outta time? He's given us 'til 10 o'clock. Hello? I'm gonna put ya on hold for a second. The man's wife is on the phone. He's a lawyer, and he's supposed to be at the office. Well, is he there? - No. Does she know who the girl is? It's his paralegal. Good evening, I'm Julie Paulson. If you know the identity of this woman or this man, call Channel Six immediately. I'm on TV. - Closed circuit? No, no, I'm serious, look. - What we do know however, is that name of the woman in this photograph may be Allison. We also know that these two people may be in very great danger. This girl, Allison, is she with you? - Yes. Look, you're in danger, where are you? Paradise Motel on Sycamore Street. What kind of danger? This Video Stalker idiot. Now, I'll tell you what. You stay put. I'll be right there. This is on TV. This is all over TV. God. Hello, hello? Dammit. What, what is it? - A serial killer. He's after you, us. - Come on. Well, what do we do? - I love the panic. I don't know what's worse, the Video Stalker or my wife! Asshole! You're such an asshole. You always were an asshole. Jesus. Goddamn love sandwich. What's the note say? - Sorry, Detective Dak. I lied. - This guy's sick. So, what time is it? It's 9:35. Jesus Christ. This is FBI Special Agent Coleman. He's been workin' with Mahoney here on the Video Stalker murders. There's been no contact with this guy in over a year and a half, and now he's comin' out. You really pissed him off when you shot that Richards lady. You destroyed his art. His fun and games are where he gets off. He wants to hurt you. There'll probably be more contact. Which is why you're not suspended. Yeah, but if I was still a detective... No, you're most helpful where you are. He's probably watching you. He has money. The latest in high-tech equipment, military weapons. He'll probably be coming after you. Where does he get this money? His videos are being distributed worldwide by a crime syndicate porn channel. Why haven't you caught this guy? - He's intelligent. Plus, he has mob resources behind him, and he's been real lucky. Yeah, now that he's operating out of emotion... - He'll screw up and we'll be there to get him. Well. You pissed off everybody but the pope. We really don't know how he feels about you, but watch your backs. Well, I figure in a week, I probably can find a way to piss the pope off, too. Well, at this rate, it won't take that long. Catch up with you later, gotta make a phone call. See ya in the car. Dakota. - Dole. May I have a word with you outside, please? No problem. So, what's up? - I'm keepin' a low profile on this case. You oughta try it sometimes. Not my style, brother. Okay, so what's up? All right, then. I'll come straight to the point. We've got a bad cop somewhere inside the department. So who is it? We don't know who. Do you know a man named Antonio Garibaldi? Yeah, he's a crime boss, porno business, stuff like that. Yeah well, we have word that the stalker's snuff films are being distributed by Garibaldi. Well, that's fine. You FBI. Why don't you pick him up? Well. It's not just him we're after. He has a silent partner somewhere in your department. So what are you telling me? There's somebody in my department that's protecting him? Protecting him, supplying him, informing him. He knows a hell of a lot more about us than we know about him. Jesus. So what are you laying this on me for? Well, unless that flaming somersault off the viaduct was an amazing act, I think you're a man that can be trusted. Yeah well, they say that about me sometimes. You find the bad seed and we'll bury him for ya, but in the meantime, watch your back, Dakota. There's someone inside your department that doesn't want the stalker to get caught. Yeah, not for long. Thanks. Yes. You're getting off the track, my friend. How so? Forget about this skid row cop. We'll take care of him. You just get to work on your next project. I am. So, you gonna ask me in? I don't know. And he whisks her away. I don't think is a good idea. Well, if we see anybody, we'll deal with it. This stuff's too important. We have to have it. Got it. Gotta copy this. No, there's one more thing I want from the computer in here. Copy this, and download all the stalker files. Get the disc from the other machine. I'll finish here. Fuck, come on. I was hoping that you'd show up. Show up for what? Well, I just wanted to personally apologize for being on the wrong team. They told me that you work late. Do you wanna kiss and make up? You know what? You have been a bad girl. You know what else? Talk is cheap. I walk the way I talk it. Do you like music? Very much. Do you like to hum? I'm an excellent hummer. Ooh, baby. I'll bet you are an excellent hummer. Shit. Have you ever played the flute? Once or twice. What about the trombone? I've always admired the trombone. What about the slide trombone? Did you see his face when the alarm went on? You were gonna do it. I don't believe it. You actually were gonna do it. Well, you said whatever it takes. Wait, wait, wait. The trombone. Did you see the trombone? A 12-digit number and the words First Bahamian. It's a bank. It's gotta be an offshore account. What the hell would this guy need a foreign bank for? I'll call a computer buddy of mine. Maybe we can access the account. Yeah. Here you go, Mommy. Thank you, sweetheart. Well, thank you. Fresh lemonade. It's really great. You make it? Yes. You know, she's the greatest thing that ever happened to me. Raising a child by yourself is so expensive. Sure glad my mom's here to help out. So I see, that's why you accepted this demotion without puttin' up a fight, right? Okay. It's good lemonade. So, what do we got so far? Somebody, the serial killer, he chooses beautiful girls, early 20s, Catholic and they're all having affairs with married men. And they all go to the same Catholic church? The task force has people at every mass and the FBI checked out all the priests, nuns, janitors. Are you Catholic? When I was a kid. So tell me this, if you wanted to choose a victim at a church, how would you do it? Well, I always wanted to know what my boyfriend said in confessions. So, find anything? Nothing. All right. Give me a shot. Back in five. Bless you, my child. Yeah. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Yeah, right. It has been how long since your last confession? Confession? Just tell God your sins. Well. I've enjoyed a little adultery. Fellatio, receiving, not giving. Is that a sin? Yes, go on. Well, I... Lie a little, cheat a little, steal a little. And I also drink too much. But I eat right. I exercise, take vitamins. Any bad language? Holy fuck. What in God's name? Well, I'm sorry Father, but I'm a cop and the Video Stalker has been recording your confessions. We're on in five, four, three, two. Officer Smith, why don't you tell us about your discovery? Well, as we were discussing earlier, we found this tiny camera and a transmitting device... Kris, they're talking about the master. Very popular Catholic church. Can you imagine having your confession, your face, on video tape? Yeah well, if he liked her looks and if she confessed to adultery, then he'd begin to stalk her. And when he was ready, having edited his movie, he would abduct her and... Well, as far as we know, these tapes were being bought and sold in Europe. Dak. Can't you see she wants you? Come on, man. Isn't that a bit unusual? It doesn't fit the profile for a serial killer to be profiting from his crimes. Well, certainly that's more information than I, I'd like to get into at this time. I understand. Recapping our top story. If you've been with us throughout this broadcast... Take this out to her. On the air? It's gonna scare the shit out of her. Just do it. Camera two, camera three, tight on her face. Yeah, a little tighter. All right, rolling all cameras. To help us answer these, and other questions, earlier today I spoke with clinical psychologist... Yes! We have received what is apparently from the Video Stalker. It has its usual laser printed label, logo. This may be a joke. We will check it out, of course. It is another development in the bizarre case of the Video Stalker. Where do we go from here? Okay. We'll be back shortly. We're going for a break. We'll be back with newstalk. We're clear. Back in three minutes. Son of a bitch! You bastard! How could let them give me this on the air? House lights. I'd like to dust that for prints. Dak, I'm scared. Sweetie, you're safe in here, okay? Can't get to you. Give me the tape, all right? Dak, I'm next. - Julie, you're safe, okay? Just give me the tape, all right? - No. No, I wanna see what this sick fuck's got on me! Check and see who brought this damn thing in. I'm on it. Julie! Low life piece of shit. Look, get me a location on his van and you get back to me as soon as possible. As soon as we're done with this weight, I want you to pick up our Video Stalker friend and fold up his operation and ship the whole pile down to Mexico. Got it. Let's go, let's go, come on. What's goin' on? Dak, he's losin' it. Dak, it's Muscles. What's goin' on? Hey, workin' on the 12 steps, come on in. Hey, I don't wanna get shot, Dak, okay? How 'bout puttin' the gun away? Come on in, Muscles. It's all clear, man. Hi. I'm on duty but I'll meet ya back at the mission. They killed my fish, man. Varmints got everything. Scavengers all over the place. But I managed to do this for you, bud. Thanks, thanks man. Tried my best, that's the only thing I could manage to hold back for you. My motorcycle. Where's my motorcycle? IRS. Ain't nothin' I could do about that. You know they're big guys. Thanks, man. Here, man. I know, I know this'll work for you. Nothin' else. Smoke one. All right. Back at ya. Shit. I mean, everything is happening in my life. I'm so close to rock bottom I can almost feel it. If you don't make some changes, you're never gonna get that loving weekend. Yeah, but I don't even have a Harley. So, that's it? You quit? Mahoney walks. The stalker wins. You comin'? Okay, I have a 12-digit number. Now I need a code. Three, two two, five four. Shit. What about birthday, wedding date? I've tried everything. I have his file right here. Look, I'll tell you what. I'm a little tired. Let's do this again later, okay? You know something? I wanna change, but I can't get out of my own way. Do you believe in miracles? Yeah. I don't know. Well, you know how to pray, don't you? Well, I used to know how to do that, but, somewhere along the way I forgot. Just close your eyes. Okay, all right. Sweet. Catch ya later. Dak. See ya tomorrow. I've got him. Damn. My cigars. Would you still dress that way if you knew this was the last day of your life? Missed a spot. Very clever, bitch. Come to papa. Party's over. We're movin' you outta town. Fuck that. The bitch has disappeared off the screen. Get her. Damn, bitch. Oh, boy. Shit. Son of a... They've got Kris. - I heard the APB. Where is she? - How would I know? Wrong answer. - You're dead, Smith. Screw you. You're crazy. - Yeah? Last time I'm gonna ask you. Where is she? I don't know. I told ya, I don't know. Relax boys, put 'em away. Mahoney's on the take. - Fuck you. Fuck me? Nah, fuck you! Jesus, Dak! - Dak! How'd you like that, Mike? That feel good? I'm gonna take out the other one. No! Wait. I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya. No, don't tell me. Show me. Stay put boys. Stay where you are. Turn left up here, turn left. My knees are killing me. My goddamn knee's killing me. Mine's been hurting for five years. - You came in late. Bullshit. You sat in the car and you drank a six-pack. They didn't show up. You drank another six-pack. Then they showed up but you didn't. You came in late. I didn't blow our your knees, you did. God. Keep going. - But he's a fuckin' psycho. He carved up his girlfriend. He screwed every guy in his company. He's in the nut house for 10 years. Now he's out doin' the same thing except he's gettin' paid for it. Wait, you don't really wanna do this. I'm a bit claustrophobic. Guys, guys, come on. Is this really a good idea? Sir, sir, sir, I really, really need to go to the bathroom. Well, go then, baby. Thanks a lot. Get the rest of the gear, we're outta here. He's losin' a lot of blood. Shut up, drive faster. You get them. I'll take the van. Don't shoot, it's me! Glad you're here, that wasn't any fun. Let's get the hell outta here. Go help Teak. Teak, you okay? I'm all right, just keep going. Son of a bitch. Hey, Detective Dak. You gettin' tired of this shit? Come and get me, man. You're just gonna keep on comin'? Come on. I'm right here. I'm all yours, baby. We gotta stop Dak. - Forget it, Mahoney. This is where we get off. Get in. What are you doin'? - Get in! I seem to be out of bullets! It's not the way I planned it. You ever think of workin' together? Can't prove nothin' on me. Good behavior, I'll be out in five years. Got something for you. I was just... Thanks. Asshole. And for 60 days and nights without alcohol, Dakota Smith. Well, all right. My name is Dakota Smith and I'm an alcoholic. This is the first time in my life I've ever had 60 days of sobriety. That's right! One after another. You know something? I like it. I like me. I like you, and I think it's gonna last. That's right, big fella. You make it happen. You know why? Why? Why is that? Hey. 'Cause I believe in miracles. What would it take to make your miracle complete? Well, I don't see how that's gonna be possible. I don't have a Harley. Teak, my man. - You've got a few friends left. Not many. We bought it at the IRS auction. You're a life saver, my man, you're a life saver. Where you get the money for this? - Money? They wanted to give it away. It's a piece of junk. They said get rid of it. Paint it, it's yours. Get outta here. Come on, we outta here. We're going far away from this place. You got that right.
