But who cares? Baba, the Master wants to see you. - The master...? I'm glad he remembers he has a soon too Welcome, welcome... where have you come from? - My morning-walk Morning-walk? I didn't know you have to leave in the night for a morning-walk One has to. There's so much of traffic in the city, you see Actually we were quite late, Uncle. And we spent the night at the farmhouse And we set out for the walk in the morning Don't you think there's a big difference between your answer and Raj's? There is, but we think alike Karan, you completed your graduation 6 years ago. 6 years It's high time you got serious. - Please, dad... When I was your age... - I know, I know, dad... you used to be my age, too You couldn't have stepped into old age right from adolescence No... I don't want to argue with you. It's pointless I'd better leave then... - One minute This is Mr Barucha Mr Barucha! How are you Is his daughter Leena your girlfriend? You have something to do with her? What will he say, sir? I'll tell you He's been having an affair with my daughter for the past few months Last week, he forced his way into my daughter's hostel... and sir... he made love to my daughter Ever since, he has been hiding from her, he refuses to give her a commitment My daughter has suffered an emotional breakdown, sir Please help me. I'm a father, sir... - Just a minute, sir Before you help him, I have something to ask Mr Barucha, is your daughter blind? - No Is she dumb? - No Couldn't she have screamed when Karan forced his way into her room? Couldn't she shout for help? No? Whatever happened, took place with mutual consent, Mr Barucha You'd be shocked if I were to give you a list of your daughter's boyfriends I'm afraid, you might suffer loose-motions Mr Thapar is a very rich man and an honourable person You'd better not try to trap him with your emotional mumbo-jumbo Don't think we're fools I'm going to the office, sir. - And stay there That's the right place for you Perfect. Stay there He simply... I'll see where Karan is, sir Karan, Barucha has left. - Really? Forget yourself, he won't even look at your house again! But Dad was right. You should start working Skip those lectures, will you? And get ready... we're going out Where are we going? - Get ready first. I'll tell you later But where are we going? - Go on, will you? And get ready quickly! - Okay Will you skip the suspense and tell me where we're going? I'll tell you, if you insist You remember Anjali...? Yes? - She's getting engaged What? You're lying, Karan! She didn't say a word to me when I met her the other day! Actually, it all worked out with the brother of her brother's friend She's getting engaged in 2 hours. - 2 hours...? Yes! - But I'm her childhood friend! So...? - So... this engagement isn't happening! It's not happening... I can't accept it! Why not? Is something wrong with her? What rubbish are you talking? Are you a friend or foe? Understand my feelings! Take a peek in my heart... you'll know what I want to say! - So what do I make of all this? I'm in love with her. - With whom? With Anjali, bro. It's Anjali! - What...? Since when? Since we were kids. - Kids? So why didn't you tell her? Thought I'd tell her when I grew up. - How much more do you want to grow? Will you wait till you're old? Here you take your time... and there, she gets engaged and married. - No, she can't get married. No way! Do you love her? - Yes, very much! You want to stop the marriage? - Absolutely, I want to! Sure...? - Sure! So let's go, gallant bridegroom! Let's bring them to a halt! That girl on the bicycle overtook us. Anjali's getting engaged today, right? We've got to get there real quick? But that girl overtook us! You're doing it deliberately, aren't you? I know you're doing it on purpose! You don't want Anjali and me to marry. - What are you going to do there? The ceremony's coming to an end anyway. Are you even sure she loves you? Well, you have a point. - There'll be so many guests there Anjali's brother, sister-in-law, her husband to-be... his parents, too! You couldn't say a word to her in privacy, in all these years... so what are you going to say to her in their presence? What will you say to her? What? I'll tell her! I tell her today that... Anjali... you are my... - Inspiration Yes, my inspiration. My... Worship? - Yes, worship! You are my... My pancake. - Yes, my pancake! Never mind. I'll do the talking. - Speak up! Hang on... Anjali, yours is the face my eyes long to see You are the one I dream of and think of My heart beats only for you Please, Anjali... do not spurn my love I've known you since our childhood, I have loved you. What is more... we even share the same bloodgroup! - Wow! What style! You're one-up on me! When she sees your style, Anjali's going to forsake the world... and throw herself at your feet! - So you agree? Indeed, I do, lover-boy! There's no stopping you today! Look at the glow on your face! No ordinary glow... it's the glow of my love for Anjali! Fool! It's the shaving-foam! Here, clean up your face. Else, Anjali will run away Step on the gas-pedal, will you? Or she'll really be engaged Stop... stop. Where's everybody? Looks like the engagement party is over already You're too late, my friend... in telling Anjali as well as coming here Even if you don't have a nice face, you must atleast say nice things What...? - Are you crazy? Looks like she has left There she is Why're you screaming? What's the problem? Tell me the truth, Anjali. Is your engagement ceremony over? Engagement? - Show me your fingers What are you upto? He's looking for the engagement ring on your fingers Engagement...? - Check out her toes Who told you I was getting engaged? - He told me! Karan, why did you speak lies? - If I didn't speak lies... how would he speak the truth? - What truth? Let hear it from the horse's mouth! - He talks so much of nonsense... you know the sort of guy he is. This guy's a nut... You've done a somersault already? You chewed my brains in the car... What did I say to you? - About Anjali! About me...? What did he say about me? He was telling me that... - I was telling you nothing! Lunatic! He's given to talking rubbish! Stop it, will you? You want me killed? - Tell her whatever you have to say Say what...? - What does he want to tell me? I'll explain. - Come with me, come... Are you crazy? What'll she think of me? Anjali, yours is the face my eyes long to see You are the one I dream of and think of My heart beats only for you Please, Anjali... do not spurn my love "If I could have someone in my life..." "who'd make life worth living" "If I could have someone in my life..." "who'd make life worth living" "A life of joys, sorrows..." "and smiles" "A beloved to love me with all his heart..." "to love me, me alone" "A beloved to dream of me..." "his head resting on my shoulder" "A man who will forget the world for me..." "who will accept my sorrows as his own" "If I could have someone in my life..." "who'd turn my life into a proper life" "To share every moment over a lifetime..." "she will share my loneliness with me" "She will talk only about me..." "and steady me should I ever stumble" "She will be what my dreams are made of..." "dreams, my eyes are an abode for" "If I could have someone in my life..." "who'd make life worth living" "A life of joys, sorrows..." "and smiles" Raj... - Yes? I've got to go home. - Sure, go on Try and understand, Raj. It's late. What will I tell my brother? Say, "I was with Raj..." "and whenever I'm with Raj, Time comes to a standstill" "I feel like remaining in his embrace, I can't spend a moment without him" "In fact, he asked me a question today." - What question? The question was... will you marry me? - What? Will you marry me? - Thank God you popped the question! I thought you'd propose marriage when you grew old... like you professed your love after so many days That's funny, that's really funny Enough of jokes. Tell me... will you marry me? Answer me, will you? - Take my brother's approval I belong to you anyway. - Karan will meet your brother for me Karan? This is not about scoring with girls! Oh yes, it isn't about scoring with girls How I wish your brother were a girl. But your sister-in-law is! He'll have a word with her. What say? - Raj! Karan, not a spoke in my wheel! Please! Hi! Namaste, brother. Namaste, sister-in-law Please be seated. There was something you wanted to talk about...? Talk about...? - You said over the phone... it was something important...? - Oh yes, there was something! About Anjali. - What did you wish to talk about Anjali? She's young, you see. - What...? I mean, she has grown up You must find a suitor and get her married So you like Anjali? - Who doesn't like Anjali? She's so sweet! The guy she marries is going to be a very lucky boy! Why don't you say it clearly that you want to marry Anjali? I only want you to give your consent... No! Not me! I've been talking about Anjali's marriage with Raj! Raj...? - Yes, Raj Raj and Anjali have known each other since their childhood days They're in love with each other It's okay to spend a few moments in love, Karan... not an entire lifetime. And what will Raj do after his marriage? Exactly what he's been doing all these years You mean, nothing Where's the need for him to do anything anyway...? Jobs are for those who are in need of money, right? As you know, whatever I possess belongs also to Raj Karan, when he has children soon and they question him... as to what he does for a living, how will he answer them? That he's somebody's friend? He needs to have a regular source of income, doesn't he? A place of his own where he can keep Anjali after his marriage? Actually, you're right. All that never occurred to me But now that you've said it... he'll soon have a house, a job and a regular source of income This is very impressive data, I'm thoroughly impressed See to it that you give it total importance Good morning, Dad. - Good morning! This is a surprise! You...? In the office? Yes, Dad. I'm here in the office I've decided to join office from today What brings about the sudden change? - It's Raj, Dad He reasoned with me that it's high time I took my life seriously... that I must pay attention to my work and business Thank God! I'll personally thank Raj for this But I have a condition, Dad I want no one to interfere in any decision I take Whatever you say, son. - So I've made up my mind, Dad Please sign these papers Karan, this is...? - C'mon, Dad! Please! Thanks, Dad. - Just a minute. Where to...? You only wanted the papers signed? - No, dad... actually, I've joined the business... but I'll resume work only after Raj's wedding And when is Raj's wedding? - Well, very soon You'll receive an invite. Okay, bye He'll never improve! He always drags Raj between us! Our second cup of coffee is almost over, but there's no trace of Karan Raj! Time to celebrate, man What's this? - Appointment Letter Who gave it? - Dad, of course You must've pressurised him. - No way, he kept pestering me instead! He was highly impressed with the way you had handled Barucha's case He has appointed you as the P.R.O. Of the company You know, he needs talented people like you It pays 50,000 rupees a month. There's a car and also a bungalow Thanks, Karan. - My friend deserves it Now tell me. When are you getting married? Whenever I come across a good girl And what's your definition of a good girl? My eyes must look at no one else, once they've seen her... my heart must start pounding and there must be a sparkle in my eyes There's the sparkle in your eyes! She has left! - After her... get her! Stop kidding, please! Have you got her car registration-number? Yes, I did. I got the number. - So give it to me As if I'm a traffic constable to secretly note down registration numbers! Am I mad to sit here and write down car numbers? Swine! You've found your bride! So it's okay with you But I've yet to catch a glimpse of my bride "The bride" "She's gonna be your bride" "How she feels shy... this bride" "On this joyous night, we're going to dance..." "this engagement day of yours, we're going to dance..." "the bride's going to sway with us" "I love, because of you" "Every joy of mine, is because of you" "In love, I find myself lost" I now belong to you" In the chiming of your anklets..." "I know my bride is feeling shy" "On this joyous night, we're going to dance..." "this engagement day of yours, we're going to dance..." "the bride's going to sway with us" "I'm gonna be your bride" "This bride feels shy" "Why can't my eyes..." "move away from your face?" "Why am I blown out of my senses...?" "What has come over me?" "The fair one and her lover are now one" "She feels so shy... this bride" "On this joyous night, we're going to dance..." "this engagement day of yours, we're going to dance..." "the bride's going to sway with us" "She's gonna be your bride" "How she feels shy... this bride!" Hi, I'm Karan Thapar. Raj's friend... Raj, the bridegroom So what am I to do if you're Raj's friend? Why aren't you dancing? Who can I dance with? Can't see a handsome, good-looking guy around Is that meant to be a joke? Or are you insulting me? Or perhaps, you don't even know what handsome and good-looking means? Whatever you choose to call it, don't think it's a joke Raj's friend A girl who forgets my name during our very first meeting... is lost to herself the next time we meet each other I mean, she remembers nothing except me You're very fast and impossible. - Hey Urmila... hear me out! The name is not Urmila. It's Kajal. - But please don't call your husband We'll have a fight for no reason. - I'm single I might end up thrashing your boyfriend! - I don't have a boyfriend! Thank God! So you were made only for me? Don't you get the feeling you talk a bit too much? Can't help it. The sight of you makes me talk the extra bit The name is Kajal. No husband, no boyfriend... she's single and ready to mingle. I have all the information The next time I meet her, I'll even steal her heart Wow! You seem to have fallen in love at last, eh? Her name is Kajal Sharma, born and brought up in London... she's here doing research in bio-genetics! My buddy's really taken off! - When you meet the right girl... you mustn't delay the romance, nor the marriage You're right. This Charlie come late... - There she goes again! I've decided. We'll get married together at the same altar. What do you say? Done! - Karan, you've barely seen the girl... and you're already planning a wedding? - It's as easy as this for me! She doesn't know my credentials. - You've said that to her... don't even talk about your credentials in Kajal's presence She's okay as far as bio-genetics go Of course, you're right! I'll never do that So, my brother has fixed the 31 st of the next month for our wedding Will you bring her around by then? Or must we postpone the wedding? Not at all! In so many days, I could woo a dozen girls! There he is! A dozen girls! - No, she's the final one! No girl after this. - Sure? I promise! Listen, ask your brother to go ahead and prepare for the wedding In the meantime, I'll help him woo his girl Let me manage that on my own. But I promise... we'll get married on the same day Thank you Excuse me Oh my God! Thank you! Kajal, What's all this about? - I don't know what's happening How sweet! My God! Who's sending all these flowers? I've no clue So it's you! - No, it's you... you, you, you... only you Why're you acting like a stuck-record? - I'll get worn out, I'll get thrashed... say "yes", please...

What's the worst she can do to you? I only hope she doesn't file a case of rape against you The police will come home, legally beat you up... Beat me up? - Yes Stop swallowing that foam! She doesn't rear dogs in the house, does she? Why...? - Well, I simply asked You're trying to encourage me, or scare me...?

These girls will make you hang! - I'm a Jat, I'll happily take the noose! Spoken like a true man! "What has come to be..." "O unfaithful one..." "just because I have loved you" He's a nice guy I don't think he'll turn up again after all that has happened Turn up...? He's already here. Hi, Kajal. Where are you? - I'm on the terrace Come on up quickly. - I'll be there in a second. Bye Hi. - Hi! Karan, this is my best friend Ishita. - Hi, how are you? Ishita, this is my on-trail-basis boyfriend... Karan Nice meeting you, Karan. - Nice meeting you too Aren't you feeling hot out here? - Yes, so let's go inside No, not inside. I'm feeling like having an ice-cream So am I! So let's go to the ice-cream parlour! Please go and fetch it, Karan...? If you think I'm going all the way downstairs... to fetch an ice-cream for you, so you can merrily eat it up... you are... you will surely eat it! Which flavour? - Honey and nuts Here we go! Yes, madam... Oh yes, madam. It will be done, sure Watchman! - Sir! I just came downstairs! How did the elevator stall? Bad times don't announce their arrival, sir Which floor do you want to go to? - The terrace That's on the 30th floor. - What...? Is that all...? 30th floor! Idea! Hi girls... I hope I'm not late? - No, you're right on time Your ice-cream. Here, baby - Thank you What's this, Karan? - What happened? I didn't want it in a cup, I wanted it in a cone You wanted it in a cone...? Go and get it, will you? Chhedilal, it's a lover-boy's body. Go easy on him I'm dying and you're cracking jokes! Who's cracking jokes? Look... I've got hot-water for you Here, take some warmth. I'll get some ice-cream for you too Ice-cream! Ishita, what do you think? Did I torture him a bit too much? Much? You got him beaten up in the bus, treated him like a servant... got him to fix your flush and asked for ice-cream on the 30th floor Is that too much? - But I hope he comes again Raj, this girl is going to be the end of me! I can see that. She's already started working on your legs I'm not meeting her ever again! It's night already. And he still isn't here! He hasn't as much as phoned me either! He has switched off his phone too! What does he think? That I'll sit at home, waiting for him? That I'll take it all quietly? I'm going to him right now... to ask him why he has done this to me! Karan... where were you? Why didn't you come? Why didn't you atleast call? What's worse, you even switched off your phone! I don't need you. Go away! You've failed the test! I can do anything for you! I can bring you the moon and the stars from the sky I could take a jump from a 25-storeyed building Kajal, I could even swallow poison for you! Boring line! - Right! Absolutely right! If I'm dead, what good is such love... right? I want to live with you, spend my life with you... I love you. - I love you, too "Get the body moving, moving..."

"let's boogey-woogey, dance-dance" We've spoken to the decorators, the caterers... haven't forgotten something, have we? - Please don't worry All arrangements for the wedding have been made Anjali's wedding trousseau will also be ready by tonight Uncle... - Mr Barucha! Welcome, welcome! What a pleasant surprise! I hope you've received the invite? I came here because I received the invite Whom are you getting Anjali married to? With Raj. Why? - Do you know Raj? Mr Barucha, maybe Karan is like that... but Raj is a very nice boy Bad company spoils the best of men There's a big difference between claiming and doing Now look, Anjali is like a daughter to me That's why I have come here. I've been hurt in the past... God forbid, may you not be hurt too Kajal...Hi - Hi Going to see Karan, aren't you? - Yes Don't be afraid. I know But maybe you don't know anything about Karan I'm Leena Barucha, Karan's ex-girlfriend What? But why must I believe you? You could even be lying I could certainly be lying, but how about these photographs...? Hi, babes. When are you coming? I'm not coming ever! C'mon, babes. Stop joking You're the one who has turned me into a joke, Karan I'm glad Leena told me the whole truth Leena...? Don't fall for her words! I've seen photographs that are proof of your character! I shudder when I think that you might... use me like you used Leena and do away with me Believe me, Kajal. That's not how it is You're the only woman I've ever loved. - Just shut up! I don't want to hear another word! Don't ever try to meet me again... nor ever try to talk to me! It's all over between you and me! Damn It Sir, lady Kajal has left with her luggage Her cellphone's switched off too Try and understand me, Anjali... - You must understand, Raj! We've sent out the wedding invites. I've even tried on the bridal fineries And you say you can't get married? If Kajal has walked out on Karan, how is it my fault? Have I caused their separation? - Did I say... you've separated them? Did I? You know, right from my childhood, Karan has always stood by me We even decided to get married together, whenever it happened He's heart-broken today. So must I rejoice, get married...? No... I can't get married. - If you've already made up your mind... you needn't reason with me. Say whatever it is, to my brother What will I say to people? My sister and I will become objects of ridicule! You're worried about the world and I'm worried about my friend Once we get married, people will shut their mouths forever I think you ought to have some patience. - But when will the wedding take place? After Karan's wedding is fixed again And Karan will never get married. I had told you, Bhaskar This guy and his friend can only toy with girls' hearts They can never settle down Mr Barucha, don't fan the fires. - I'm not fanning the fires... I'm trying to save Anjali's life from fire! That scoundrel of your friend ruined my daughter's life... Don't you say anything against my friend! - What are you going to do? Hit me? What worse humiliation can a father face than what your friend did to my daughter? Don't provoke me! I can also reveal what sort of a girl your daughter is There, he speaks about my daughter! Tomorrow, he'll speak about Anjali! Are you looking for an excuse to break off the alliance? He's falsely accusing me. - This chap is Karan's sidekick! A dog who lives off his crumbs! - Barucha, don't you dare... You have no right to insult him in my house! And what wrong did he say? Have you even been able to find a job on your own? Please be quiet, brother... - Hear me out! Even that was charity given by Karan to you! What are you worth anyway? What are you worth? Must I turn my sister's life into a farce? For the sake of your womanising friend? - Not a word against my friend, please! You can't even marry because your friend is heart-broken! He's not dead, is he? You raise your hand on my brother? He said offensive things about Karan, so I... Brother was right. You can never go against Karan Because you live off him Whose is the house? It's Karan's Whose is the car? It's Karan's You're just a shadow of Karan Who do you possess anyway? There was love... which I thought, was for me. But no, you don't even have that What is your own identity? How does one know you for what you are? Nothing! You're nothing but a parasite! Our relationship is over! Make sure you forget that you ever knew me Get the hell out of here! Don't make the mistake of trying to meet me ever again! Get out! What rubbish! You said we'd get married together... but why can't it be a few days apart? Did you have to break off the alliance over such a petty thing? Look, I'll make Anjali understand You'll get married on the appointed day... come with me I'm not marrying Anjali. That's it. - But why not? Because I can't take the things she said to me today. They hurt my feelings But what she said was true. I have no identity of my own What nonsense are you talking? - No nonsense, Karan. It's the truth My job, you gave me. My house, yours... my car... your charity. What do I have to call my own? Don't say such things. What's the difference between you and me? We're not different people. What's mine, is yours. You keep what is yours. I must make for myself an identity of my own And that will be possible only when I distance myself from you You want to go far away from me? - I don't have a choice Raj, we share the same goal and the same path! But I have lost myself somewhere along the way I wish to go to a place where people know me for my name... where they will know me for my work. I wish to carve my own identity Look, create an identity of your own, if you wish to But you can do that even by staying with me No. If I live with you, I'll always remain in your shadows And that's something I don't want to do Don't leave me, my friend. I won't be able to live And should I stay with you, I won't be able to live either I've begun to feel stifled of late After living together all these years... you're beginning to feel stifled today? I admit, you have done a lot of favours to me Which I'll never be able to repay You have always stood by me. But I no longer need your company Need...? You stayed with me all these years, only out of need? You get it now, don't you? Let go of my collar Go! Go wherever you want to! But remember one thing... I want to remember nothing! I want to forget everything I want to forget everything, Karan Even our friendship? Yes... our friendship too Karan... are you okay? Raj had come to see me. He has returned the keys of the flat He has resigned his job and returned the cheque as well He had something to say, too Yes, something about his identity. He wants to make it on his own I'm glad he has seen sense. Better late than never In any case, he was only a burden you have been carrying since your childhood Mrs Thapar, he wasn't a burden on me. I was the burden he bore... of loneliness, something the two of you gave me ever since I was a child Had he not held my hand and steadied me, I wouldn't have been here today Anyway, Raj is such a user Mom, why do the poor always reach for the hands of the rich? Darling, it's just a strategy. They take the hands of such lonely souls... so that they can turn rich overnight They lead a lifestyle they can only dream of They use sweet words to win over your hearts They're jokers, they entertain you till you get addicted Now look at Karan. He can't live with Raj Raj knows that very well And he's surely going to take big advantage of this Enough! Not another word against him! Else, I'll forget the relation you and I share! Karan, you're crossing your limits! When did I adhere to limits that I'd transgress them, Dad? You kept me off limits right from the very beginning... so that I could never reach you If there was anyone who gave me support... it was only Raj. If there was anyone I got happiness from... it was only Raj Only Raj made up for whatever was lacking in each of my relationships! And today, he's gone too. He's gone Raj... where are you going? - To the airport I'm leaving this city for good. - Come, let me drop you I'll get to enjoy your company for a little more time Hop in, c'mon I'm sorry, Raj. I was being very selfish the other day You asked me for something for the first ever time... and I started fighting with you. I pray for you from the bottom of my heart... may you be successful in whatever you do May you succeed in carving an identity of your own And wherever you are... you will always be my friend Relations that culminate in nothing are better forgotten May we leave now? It's already very late Your boarding pass, sir. Have a nice flight Passengers travelling to Mumbai on Jet Airways flight no 415... are requested to procced for the security check. Thank you. Okay. I'll leave Must you go? - Yes What happened to you...? - Nothing... nothing's wrong with me You're hiding something from me, eh? - Why'd I hide anything? You can't leave... come with me! Raj is suffering from a disorder of the bone-marrow Bone-marrow...? - Yes... one in millions is affected by this disease... in which, the body stops producing Red Blood Corpuscles Maybe a mistake was made during your tests...? Raj had the first attack of this disease on the night of his engagement After that, we did all the necessary tests But all the results should be same thing But there surely is a cure? No, this disease has no cure How can you be so sure? There has to be a cure for it, somewhere in the world? You may consult anyone you wish to, for your satisfaction But in my opinion, medical science has no cure for it. It's a rare disease When the body loses the ability to produce blood... man cannot survive I don't believe this. I don't believe this! Don't be taken in by what they say. They're talking a load of nonsense! There is a cure for your ailment! There is a cure! And you had a fight with me without any reason... over such a petty thing? Bloody idiot! You even went and fought with Anjali? Come with me, I'm going to set everything straight Let's go to Anjali. - Where...? Where're you going? It's too late. Besides, today's her wedding too Do me a favour. I have a desire. I want to see her dressed as a bride "Pine, be ruined..." "fail, be humiliated..." "come the time of union..." "you will know that separation is another name for Love" "Fall not in love..." "fall not in love" "My eyes brimming with tears..." "my heart, gripped by fear" "what stage has love brought these crazy lovers to?" "Fall not in love..." "Shocks, one has to overcome..." "one has to nurse his broken heart" "In love..." "one has to be prepared to annihilate himself" "Fall not in love..." "Love is fire, love is an unaccomplished journey" "Love drives you restless, love sends you into a tizzy" "Love gives you anonymity, love gives you notoriety" "Love makes you do what you would never do" "Love is the deceptive shade..." "that is actually a spark" "What has love reduced these crazy lovers to?" "My eyes brimming with tears..." "my heart, gripped by fear" "Fall not in love..." "Love, love, love..." "Love, a storm in the sea. Love, a city of dreams" "Love is agonising. Love is a debt you owe" "A hundred wounds I endured in love..." "and yet, I remained silent" "To love is not easy. For love begets love" "Love begets love..." "Fall not in love" "My eyes brimming with tears..." "my heart, gripped by fear" "What has love reduced these lovers to?" "Fall not in love" "Love..."

Answer me! Why are You quiet? Give me a reply! Why must You run people's lives the way You want to? What right have You to do that? Snatch, when You want to... and give, when You want to! When I was lonely as a child... You gave me my friend He's the one I got all the happiness in the world from I got a reason to live! So why are You snatching him from me now? It's because You are jealous of me, isn't it? You are jealous! You can't bear to see our friendship! Take my life, if You must But spare my friend's life I couldn't bear to see my friend trying to finish himself I knew, he couldn't ever bear to see me die And so, I wished to go away from here. Far away from him I need just enough time to put together my friend's shattered relationships... so that he will have support. Because, even after I'm dead... he lives comfortably. Please try and ensure that I have so much time Excuse me, Mrs Thapar... I need to have a word with you. It's regarding Karan My liquor's over. John, get me another bottle. Go on Wait... you're not bringing anymore liquor Mrs Thapar...? How are you, Mrs Thapar? Stop it, Karan Karan calls me Mrs Thapar. You know how it hurts? He hates me. - Do you hate him too? How can I hate him? I'm his mother, after all When you are his mother, why do you deny being what you are? When you forgot what relation you shared with him... what would that poor chap remember? What did I say to you...? Quietly eat your food. Else I... Else, what...? Else, what, Mrs Thapar? If you call me Mrs Thapar again, I'm going to... Why? Has Mr Thapar given you a divorce? How dare you, Karan! Okay, okay. Henceforth, I'll address you by your first name. Okay? You'll address me by my first name? Yes, Mrs Thapar. Henceforth, I'll address you by your first name Try calling me that! Kiran Thapar I'm sorry, my son. I'm sorry Why didn't you ever exercise your right over me, Ma? And why didn't you ever address me as Ma earlier? Forgive me, Ma. I'm sorry... I'm sorry It's okay Nandini... Nandini... Where does she remember my birthday that I should turn emotional today? Your relations won't end whether you get emotional or not You'll still be her brother, won't you? But when has she ever acknowledged me as her elder brother? If you make the same mistake, what will be the difference between the two of you? She's younger to you, you got to forgive her... let her get away with anything. If you wish her today... are you going to lose something? Baby left for college yesterday and still hasn't returned Nandini leaves home for college, from there she goes to the nightclub She sleeps at a friend's and returns home the next afternoon This has been her practice for years. She just won't listen Mom, I've called all her friends. Nobody knows where she is Hello, Mr Bhargav? - Sir, the last 5 calls... have been made from the same location between 2 to 4:48 a.m. After that, the cellphone was either off, or the battery was dead And what is the location? - M.G. Road, Gurgaon Rocky... can I have another joint? - More...? Please give it to me, Rocky Let's see the money. - I'm not carrying any... I'll give it to you tomorrow. - Who has seen tomorrow? Let's settle it right now Don't touch me... let me go! Nandini... are you okay? Hey... what's your problem? Just join the party She's my kid sister! Hey... C'mon leave the girl Brother... forgive me, please Please, brother... I'm a terrible girl What happened to her? - Nothing, nothing... Nothing...? So what's all this about? Dad, I have a request. Neither will you mention this incident to Nandini... nor will you ask her any questions I'll personally have a word with her tomorrow morning Believe me, Ma. She's fine, she's absolutely fine There's no cause for worry. - Karan... there's really no cause for worry anymore You are finally beginning to shoulder the responsibility of the family Thank you... thank you, son. - Why're you embarrassing me, dad? Doesn't behove a father to thank his son so profusely Oh yes... maybe you're right I shouldn't be saying "thank you" to the two of you... I should be saying "I'm sorry" instead - Dad Yes, my son. I have neglected my duties as a father... as a result of which the two of you had to suffer so much And I hate myself for having done this No, Dad. Don't say that - My son... please do forgive me, if you can Well? Such a brightly lit up room! Studying in the darkness, are you?

I enjoyed breaking off with him? I was heart-broken, too. My faith was shattered... he hurt me terribly! Anyway, forget about him I've forgotten him... - Had you really forgotten him... you wouldn't have reacted like this Just show me one person who does not have a past! And believe me, I'll concede defeat to you There was a time when Karan had a new girlfriend every week-end But ever since he had met you, he had forgotten his old ways He loves you so much and you want to forget about him? D'you think I'd have been here, reasoning with you... if he were in the arms of another girl? Never! I've come to you because I know you really love him very much... and you can give him the support he badly needs at the moment Trust me on this. He loves you very much And I know, you love him a lot too. I know it and I can see it Hi Raj. - Hey Kajal! How are you? What are you doing here? - Well, I've been waiting for someone Come, sit with us. - Does Karan want that too? Please. - Sit down Oh, I love this song! Will you dance with me, Karan? Go ahead. - No, I'm not in the mood To refuse to dance with a girl is bad manners What a good-mannered girl. Go ahead and dance, buddy Let him be, Raj. Let him sulk If he doesn't want to dance, why don't you shake a leg with me? Of course. I'm game! Let's go. - No, Raj Why mustn't I dance? You don't want to dance, but I do... and I'm going to! - Let it be, Raj I'm not in the mood either. I'm not going to dance Ruined her mood, haven't you?

"when you walked into it" "All sense of happiness was deserting me..." "when you walked into my life" My friend has found his lifemate. I wouldn't regret dying now Why do you say such things? Don't miracles ever take place? Oh yes, they sure do But what if that hope awakens a desire for a longer life? I'll start being afraid of death. Well, never mind all that Thank you for being such a good friend, doctor You call me doctor, and you call me a friend...?" Okay...

What a pleasant surprise So you're following in your friend's footsteps? How many hearts will you break, Raj? How many lives will you destroy? Excuse me... what's happening here? - Nothing... You don't know me, but nobody knows me better than he does He's a very self-centered man. For the sake of his entertainment... he can use and discard anybody, even before you can realise it Maybe what you believe is not true at all... So you've fallen for his sweet words too? That's his talent for you. Open your eyes, as soon as possible Else, you will go through the same hell as I did He shattered all my dreams and desires. My tears have dried up... but my wounds haven't healed. I pined for you every day I died a death every day I hope you will also die, pining for someone I hate you, Raj.
