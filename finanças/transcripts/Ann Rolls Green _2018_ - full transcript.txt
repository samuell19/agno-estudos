would you be interested in committing your life to God today ma'am I'm familiar with God thanks and quite frankly I think this leaflet seems a little bit misrepresentative all right in what way well I'm assuming this is Jesus right right well he's too big. Big? Well do you really think Jesus was that big? Well, no it's just an artwork. An artwork to induct people who don't know or don't care about Christianity and all you're telling them is that Jesus was the size of a building. It's because it's representative because God's love so surpasses our own it just seems like he's bigger. Bullshit, if you wanted him to seem big then you could have just put him in front of a crowd and let perspective do its job instead you made it look like attack of the 50-foot Jesus. Alright I get it. Have you ever met Jesus? No. No, me neither but he definitely wasn't that big. Look I didn't do the artwork alright? But you are handing it out and I don't want it. Um we have other leaflets. I'm fine thanks though if you want my advice people won't find Jesus in a leaflet. Ann. Jane. how was your morning? Uneventful, mostly, I had a cup of coffee. I noticed and how was your weekend? Equally uneventful. Is that right? What an exciting life you lead Ann Somehow I ended up Sunday morning back of house in a bowling alley. Had you been bowling? I don't think so, always wanted to but no one ever wants to go Well at least you came close. Jane do you know if those red cupboards came in? I dunno maybe. Maybe? There was a delivery yeah. And did any of them resemble red cupboards? Could have been cupboards could have been tables could have been a grand piano for all I know, didn't open the crates. Well that's incredibly helpful, Thank You Jane. No problemo Oh wait I was meant to say Ann, there's some crazy dude looking for you, said something about you helping him find a nice lamp or something like that Well what was his name? I dunno, he was kinda cute though, don't know what he's looking for you for perhaps it's your superb furniture expertise Denny. That's a nice chair actually. You don't look that excited to see me. Just wasn't expecting to see you, especially when I'm at work. Well it's been a while so I thought you know, I'd make a surprise visit. It hasn't been that long it's been about a month Ann, I think that qualifies as a while. Is there something going on? You know me Ann, there's always something going on. With you there is yeah, so what is it? what's so important that you had to come here while I'm working? New business cards firstly. Of course. And wristbands! I mean I would give you one but unfortunately I've already given them all out so... So what you're starting another revolution? The revolution never stopped Ann, just now we have wristbands. Well good for you, so what, you're here to try to attempt to get me to rejoin your club again with the promise of ugly wristbands? It's not a club and ugly? Yeah ugly I don't know what you were thinking when you ordered them in contrasting red and green. Well Stuart designed them and I thought they stood out at least. Look Denny I don't have time to stand here talking to you about wristbands so is that all? No Ann I did have something more important to tell you. And what's that? Well it's one of them good news bad news situation. Just spit it out. Alright. We found Frank, Ann Where? We found Frank Ann, but unfortunately that's where the good news ends What happened? Nothing happened, it's just that, well, he's gone mad quite frankly. Mad how? This whole thing's a bit complicated Ann, I just thought I'd tell you, you know, we're working on it. Who's we? The club? We're not a club we are the order of the Holy Redeemers. And what fucking right do you think you've got coming into my personal business like that? You asked me to help Yeah I asked you to help me find him not to deal with him - where is he? Ann, listen, we can help, we are helping just come to the next meeting. Just tell me where he is. I promise we'll take you there but it's not as simple as giving out an address so will you come please? What is this meeting? Well it's to recruit new members, you know, so we can help find Frank. I thought you said you'd found him! Yeah but it's a bit more complicated than that we need help to get to him. You better tell me what exactly you mean by that Denny. I'll tell you at the meeting Ann. I don't need a public forum to discuss Frank, Denny. It won't be like that believe me just come. When? It's on the card. Join the resistance, stop the end of the world, that's how you're selling this? yeah why not? Because you're not fighting off aliens with your laser vision Denny I'm not and I don't get what you're referencing to there. You just better not be messing me around, that's all. I'm not, I promise, look Stuart really wants to see you anyway I mean he would have come today but he's moving house at the moment so it's a bit difficult really. Right well I hope he's well. He'll be at the meeting. Okay, so is that all? Yeah I think that's about it. Um actually, do you have any sword polish? I don't... You have a sword now Denny? I recently acquired a rather nice sword yes. I don't even think sword polish is specifically an actual thing, I can probably get you some metal polish if you'd like? No, no I think I'll be alright actually, anyway I think I better get back to handing out these business cards hopefully we can whip up a good crowd this time! How many people have you invited to this thing? Well as many as I have business cards. And that is? don't worry about it Ann, just make sure you get there early to get a good seat. alright? what's wrong with the posters anyway? Can you please try to remember the last time we went for posters. Every time we put them up someone always rips them down. Yes and people are always chucking the business cards away. I don't know why you always shut down my idea of getting pens. Not much of a turn up then especially considering the fact I'm five minutes late. People still might come They will still come. If I didn't know you two, and I wasn't aware of the club already and I turned up to this old creepy Church in the dodgy end of town I would probably think you were gonna kill me and eat me. See I was saying this to Denny. Yes you've said it a million times we don't need to hear it again I swear every day I either have you trying to move our meetings to some ugly community center or campaigning for damn pens. People like the pens. People don't need flippin pens people use iPads. What's the problem anyway we don't need more people we have Ann. It's a problem because we need a bigger team you know that. Ann's fucking right this is all because you fucked up the pens. Ann doesn't like the pens? I didn't say I hated them I just said they're an interesting color choice. They stand out. She called them ugly. You fucked up Stuart. Why don't you just order more in different colours? Because we spent our whole budget on that batch These are all wristbands? Yes. How many are there? It's about 20,000. Why in the name of God would you need 20,000 wristbands? Please don't blaspheme Ann. I'm sorry but there's three of us here not 20,000 what do they even say and how fucking much did they cost you? It was about three thousand pounds. Three thousand pounds? How the hell did you afford that? Took out a Loan, Ann, it's not a problem You don't even have a day job how are you gonna pay that back? Ann, we're on the precipice of changing the world all we need is a little bit of cash to get the ball rolling and then a tiny little loan for wristband won't matter. Do you think I give a fuck about changing the world? what about Frank? He's part of that. How is he part of that? How does he have anything to do with this stupid Club? We're not a club, once again, we were an order, we are the order of the Holy Redeemers. You should try to remember that. Yes I remember when we were 14 and we used it as an excuse to make graffiti and protest signs. Things have changed Ann, you never should have left. I'm glad I left but for better or worse I'm here now. Now take me to Frank. We'll get to it in the briefing okay? No we'll do it now because believe me, nobody else is turning up. Well hello all What? Oh of course you two must know each other! Jane, what the hell are you even doing here? well Denny is pretty cute in his own kind of way, but I'm sure I don't need to tell you that. Plus this whole revolutionary thing seems kind of fun didn't think it was your kind of thing though Ann, I always imagined you reading a book in a bath or something on your nights off. That's funny, I always imagined you crying in the corner drinking wine straight from the bottle Not quite, so you here for Denny as well then? providing a little competition? Denny's my cousin Jane. Great, no competition at all then, not that I was worried before of course. Alright listen up, Jane, we're here you're here because we're at war. War? Cool, I dig it. I'm glad you dig it. Can I just ask who's this war with? This war is with the world, the world as we know it. Okay but who do I get to shoot? I guess is my question. Denny can we just cut the bullshit war with the world spiel now? Ann, I hate to test your patience but I have to explain things to Jane alright? This won't take long Ann. Stuart is it? Tell me, where are you from my foreign friend? I'm not foreign I'm British. I'm not gonna deport you I just want to discern your smokey accent. It's not an accent. Jane will you stop it? Stop what? It's okay Ann, it's fine. So what is it? Uh well I I suffer from this condition, it makes me sound like this, it's called foreign accent syndrome. Is that a thing? It's a thing. Wow that must be weird. I mean it's okay once you get used to it and hey at least it's not leprosy! Can we move on please? Wait I'm still confused By my accent? No, about this whole war with the world thing. Jane, our society is on the verge of collapse. Any Tom Dick or Harry could give you a reason why but us we know for sure and we know it can be stopped Stuart and I, we've worked tirelessly in the past to sway the public opinion on the world. to try to make a change. We've long been a secretive group at war with the end of the world but now we're recruiting to build an army so we have the manpower to take on the greatest mission yet. What might that be? We're getting to that. Hold on Denny, we are talking about finding Frank aren't we? Ann I was in the middle of explaining things. Who's Frank? Seriously Ann, you take all the dramatic effect out of something when you, you know, you come in halfway through a speech like that. Denny can I talk to you in private please? What for? Denny now. Danny I swear if you keep treating finding Frank like some kind of military operation I am going to kill you. It's not like that. Yes it is, you're acting like some kind of army general or something for no fucking reason whatsoever. Seriously Ann, when you shout out halfway through a speech you are seriously undermining my authority. What, in front of Jane? Yes in front of Jane. Fuck Jane. She's here for the cause Ann. you know and to potentially help find Frank, I don't know why you can't see that. Well because I can't think of one reason why she'd want to help me because I don't want that bitch's help. Quite frankly Ann you're being a bit of a bitch yourself okay. Excuse me why should I care in the slightest about her. Because she turned up, because we need the numbers. For what? The plan. What fucking plan? Just take me to Frank and he and I can talk about it. Ann, listen, Frank... What? He thinks he's Jesus. What? He thinks he's Jesus. Bullshit. He's dangerous Ann, but we're here to help okay? how long have I known you? I don't know, all the time I've been living. Well then you can trust me then can't you? Even if it's just this once. Jane where did you get that from? I always carry them with me, do you want one? okay Stuart do you want to take it from here or? Oh yeah yeah okay yeah so hmm Sorry, bit nervous, so uhh basically Denny and I we did some recon the other day and we discovered that Frank likes to camp out in the forest outside the city, most of the time. When did you do recon? Uh, last Sunday. And why wasn't I invited? We wanted to make sure that it was actually Frank before we actually told you so... Wait why why would you tell her anyways and is someone gonna tell me who this Frank guy is? Jane shut it. Yeah so um basically yeah we discovered through the recon that Frank likes to hide out in the middle of the forest outside the city most of the time. Uh, and it's a 15-minute walk from the car park which is about three pounds fifty for the day if that's okay yeah yeah and yeah we must be very very quiet just so we don't spook Frank out and yeah and one more thing actually, it's a bit odd but we discovered that Frank - Oh, thank you. What the heck does that mean? oh don't worry about it's just just unnecessary info really. Okay, listen I'm fine if you guys want to keep some sort of mystery, kind of dig it but I suppose I just want to make sure that you guys aren't Nazis or something. We are not Nazis. it's just I went out with the Nazi once and it's the worst mistake I've ever made in my life. Look, we are not Nazis! Not gonna lie you kinda sound like a Nazi. Jane, we are not Nazis. Alright, then is someone gonna tell me who this Frank guy is then? He's an old friend who unfortunately has gone mad. So when you find Frank what are you gonna do? The plan. My three-step plan to rehabilitation. And that is? We'll get there Ann, alright? Okay well I'm happy to enlist then sir in whatever god damn war this may be. Okay sounds great but please don't blaspheme, alright? Sorry, sir... Not much of an army are we? About time. hey Ann, how's things? Denny, Stuart. Hiya. Good to see you Jane, you ready to go? Yeah I think so what's with the toy sword? it's not a toy sword, it's a foam replica, because apparently you're not allowed real swords out about. How surprising. Where's the real sword? At home. I'd like to see it. I'd uh... I'd like to show you. Can you stop? please? Are you ready Ann? Sure though while we're on the topic, quite frankly I don't see why you need any kind of sword at all. We need the sword so that I can chase Frank and Stuart can then tie him up. Yeah but I don't even understand why Stuart's got to tie him up! You trust me don't you? I'm trying. Well that's all I ask then. We definitely have everything yeah? Yes let's fucking do this shit let's go! Alright, follow me. Come on Stuart. Come on. Are you alright Ann? I'm fine Stu. Just used to parking more like two minutes away from where I need to be. You don't like the fresh air? It's not the fresh air I don't like it's the walking. Something tells me you don't much like Jane either. I don't really think I've been keeping that a secret. Suppose not, I think she's all right! You don't know her. Maybe you don't her either Ann, you know enemies don't usually understand each other's that's the whole point. We're not enemies Stu, she's just a fucking bitch. right well, after this I hope we can all be good friends, and you know Ann, I'll always be there for you if it comes to it. That's very sweet Stu, you're you're a good guy. Yeah I know I'm a good guy but I don't get to see much of you nowadays No, well, busy people! Yeah, busy... So when are you going to come to my house? you know we've almost finish the unpacking and dad, dad can cook you some dinner Oh he'd love to meet you. Oh yeah, I'll have to come round some time. You could see my models. Oh, the ones you painted right? Yeah yeah and built. Yeah, I think you showed me some pictures. Yeah I know but they're so much better in the flesh and we could do some painting together, maybe we could build some... So listen Ann, you and Frank - What about me and Frank? Well Denny told me that you two went to school together, and that he was important to you, but no more than that. It's complicated Stu... Did you love him? I don't want to talk about it Stu we're not school children anymore and love's just a word. it is a word, yes, but it's a very strong word. Yeah but it's open to interpretation, I could easily say I loved Denny or I love you and it doesn't mean the same thing. Well I am pretty loveable though... Oi, you two, come over here quick. There, that tent. What about it? Can you hear the music and the footsteps? Yeah I get it. What if we get the wrong hermit? He's not a hermit. It's him without a doubt. Denny please put that sword away you don't need it. Relax Ann, it's just foam, it's not like I'm gonna cut him into tiny little pieces now is it? Aw, that's a shame. Okay so we remember the plan? Stuart and Ann start circling around and get into position and then you whistle, me and Jane will follow suit, get into our position. Jane it's important that you stay behind me close, but not too close, you're really just there to block him. got it, I think. Are we ready to go? Okay let's go. Frank... You asshole! You asshole! Okay stop it! Stop it! What the actual fuck Denny, were you trying to kill him? No he ran! Yeah he ran, he didn't attack you! I was trying to chase him towards you! no you weren't! I'm sorry is no one gonna mention the fact that that man looked like a giant apple? I just saw you chase a dancing apple through the forest with a toy sword. It's not a toy. He's also not a real apple. We know he's not a real fucking apple Stu. Listen, we don't understand the apple thing either alright? But you knew about it, so why didn't you say something? Because, we knew you wouldn't believe us, I told you he's gone mad. He's not mad he's just confused. Well whatever you want to call it he thinks he's Jesus and he spends his weekends dressed as a dancing apple, we just want to help you fix him You want to fix him Denny because you think he's disgracing your stupid fucking holy Redeemers. So what if I do it helps us both! He's not some enemy for you to take down. Alright! For the record I think it's kind of hot, to dress up like fruit I mean. Jane, don't fucking start. Also for the record I thought he looked more like a tomato than an apple, and I don't think this is as strange as you're making it out to be. No of course because most people spend their weekends chasing men dressed like apples through the forest. Ann, I'm sorry we didn't tell you alright, but you've seen him now and we just want to help. Okay wait, can I just check, so is it men dressed as fruit that we're fighting in this army or just apples? The apple thing is irrelevant. It's all fucking irrelevant. Ann, for one second will you just let me speak to Jane? Be my guest. Jane, we've been through this before you know we're nearing the end of the world and quite frankly, Frank is one of the reasons why. Because he's an apple? No, because he thinks he's Jesus. I've not read the Bible but does Jesus dress up like an apple? No no forget the apple thing. Alright, apologies. Jane, Stuart and I, we belong to a very secret ancient order. Oh yeah what were you guys called again? The Holy Redeemers. And what about Ann? Ann used to be in the order, you see we live we work and have always worked to stave off the end of days by counteracting apocalyptic signs. So, like like Jesus? Yes, but the biggest problem isn't that he thinks he's Jesus is that people are actually starting to believe him now Believe he's Jesus? Exactly. That's so silly as if Jesus was even a real person... Wait so you guys aren't Jesus freaks are you? Uh we resent that term. Christians then? Men of God and of the Holy Redeemer too. Jesus... Jane, don't blaspheme. So you don't read the Bible but you do you dig God? actually the Bible is a fairly accurate representation and biography of Jesus Christ who was without a doubt the Son of God it's just not the be-all and end-all. So why do you care that Frank's pretending to be Jesus? Do you remember that time when Jesus was like thou shalt not worship other idols. No can't say I do. it's in the Ten Commandments. Oh right of course! An increase in false idols is a sign of the end of the world and at least one that we're trying to prevent. What else do you do? No no not yet. Why? Why not yet? Because the plan is classified, for Holy Redeemer eyes only, if you want to be part of this, if you want to join the order, you have to be baptized. Alright fine I can get on board with this whole god thing so christen me a Holy Redeemer or whatever. So how's this work then? No that won't be necessary at least that's not the trial. So how's it work then? To prove yourself, to prove you are a warrior of God, you must let God consume you and then you will have his power to wield. Cool. First, you must walk forward until all you see is green and then finally beneath the trees you must accept God into your heart and shout defiantly God is in my hands! Alright then. Ann, any chance you want to be baptized again? To rejoin the order? No thanks. So how long's this gonna take then? Ann, what are you doing? Nothing. Alright, well I'm here to be baptized or something. Oh, good for you, letting God into your heart like this! Well at least I'm open to the idea unlike some people outright refuse to be baptized. Not that it matters but I did the baptism. When? When I was 14 Oh right, before you ditched them. Ditch is not the right word. Aright then Ann, tell me, are you a Jesus Freak? I'm not a Jesus Freak and I'm not a Holy Redeemer I'm just a Christian. Okay then, so just a plain old vanilla God lover then? Honestly though I legit never took you for the religious type. I've been a Christian all my life Jane you just don't know me. Maybe not but you just never seem that into it. Into what? Jesus. Anyway, this whole thing seems kind of cool, you have to least admit that, when did the club start? It's not some ancient order like Denny says it is Jane, It's just something he made up when he was fifteen. Oh right, that's a bit less cool then. It's all bullshit. So what's in the red folder? Bullshit, lots of it but the gist of it? Denny thinks he can use his power to counteract revelations and make everyone follow the Ten Commandments or else we're all going to go up in flames, oh and he thinks it's gonna happen any second now. Well, I'm still intrigued to see what's in the folder, so you just here for that Frank dude then? It's none of your business. Well Denny told me not to say anything but he said you guys used to be young lovers. Again, none of your business. You can be so annoying sometimes Ann, the one time you've got something interesting going on in your life you won't tell me anything about it. Haven't you got a baptism to be going to? Yeah I do but I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to be doing. Well you've got to let God enter your heart, but I don't see that happening. How would you know? You're so judgmental sometimes Ann. Prove me wrong. Nah, it's not worth it. If I kneel down waiting for some vision to happen it's just gonna make me really disappointed, plus I'll get dirty knees. So I'm just gonna wait here for a bit then I'm gonna go back and tell Denny that my life's been changed by Jesus. And you think they'll believe you? They're not gonna know. God will. Well lucky for me, God doesn't exist. Anyways, I'm gonna be going so I'll see you back at the tent. It was like I knelt there and God entered my very body and sat beside my soul. Right Ann! are you alright? I'm fine Stu, I just want to find Frank Now all that remains is that you bend the knee and I hereby name you a member of the Order committed to the cause forevermore and here you must swear your allegiance to the cause and its eternal mission to save the world to prevent the beginning of the end Jane, you've got to say I swear. Oh, oh right I swear I guess. Then that's it you may rise, you are now a member of the order, a soldier of the cause. What are those wristbands? Did you not get a wristband? Apparently not. Well go get her one! I don't think I brought any... I told you, always be carrying wristbands! Has Ann got one? She's not even a proper member! We meant to give you one at the church. I'm so jealous right now. What do they say? Deus in manus vestras. What's that? It's Latin. for what? It means, God is in your hands! Alright, they're pretty ugly, and I don't really know what they mean, but I really want one. You couldn't find any? No, I didn't know I was meant to bring any! And why don't you have any? Well that's it, it's just fucking typical isn't it. We could post you One! Yeah sure we could post it to you! Yeah what's your address? Can you just stop? Somehow I don't think wristbands are the most important thing right now, and I don't know about you but I'd actually like to get out of this fucking forest and go home. No wait a minute, I wanna know the plan like I was promised. The plans a load of crap! Ann, seriously! Just email it to her! No Ann! Fine, forget it, I'm going. Stuart, the folder please. Yep, it's in there! Ann! You didn't have to rush off like that. I don't need to hear Denny's Looney plan again Stu! I know it's a bit much... A bit much? It's the ravings of a fanatical bigoted lunatic in a pretty red folder. He's only exaggerating! Well you say that Stu but maybe you weren't there when he was swinging his sword at Frank like he was some sort of flying that needed to be swatted Well, he can't be any more of a lunatic than Frank! What do you mean? Well I mean he was dancing around dressed as an apple. He's just confused, he has his reasons. Denny has his reasons too, he's trying to save the world, and if a few people have to die and suffer then so be it. He wants to kill Frank Stu. No, Denny is not going to kill Frank Ann - if he did then why would he bring you along, it just doesn't make sense. We want to help, Ann, we want to help you, we want to help Frank. And if that means we have to kidnap him on the way then... That's the way it has to be... And then, we just follow the three-step plan to rehabilitation. Oh yeah, and I can't wait to hear that. Frank isn't hurting anyone - but he is hurting people, with his words, anyone and everyone who listens to him. But anything he does he does it with a good heart. Then he's a lot like Denny then, except, that Denny is right. Ann, let us help. Give us a chance. Alright, but Denny better fucking tone it down. Thank you Ann. I'm going to the car. You guys are fucking lunatics, I love it! You two alright? Oh, we're fine! Denny, in future, no swords of any kind alright? Okay, no swords. I like the sword. No, no fucking swords! Alright! Fine, what's the plan anyways? Where do we find Frank? We look for Jesus... Why didn't we look for Jesus to begin wit, you know when we're not in the middle of a fucking forest? Because it's somewhat easier to capture a man in the middle of a forest than it is when he's preaching to his devout followers in the middle of town. How many are there? About three regulars usually, at least. Doesn't seem like there's much of a chance of his returning after that Fiasco though. And we're running out of time. What's the time limit? Oh, I don't know, just the end of the fucking world. Got it. He usually preaches in the center of town, by a church there, I don't know, I'll email you when I get all the details all right we'll sort everything out Alright, is that it? I suppose. Well I'll see you guys soon then. See you soon Ann! Ann! Can I speak to you for a second? What is it? I don't know I just um, I just wanted to say sorry for today and everything going wrong and me swinging my sword around at Frank and et cetera. It's fine. Good, are you sure? Yeah Denny just forget about it. Alright, good. Is that it? While we're chatting - Jane, what do you think of her? I hate her, with a passion, is that not obvious? I just I honestly think she's alright. Yeah, I'm not surprised she seems just your type in that she's female and exists. I don't know she just seems like a sweet girl. She's not sweet there's nothing sweet about her. Nice then. Not nice, you think she's hot because she's a slutty bitch. No! Come on Ann... What has she ever done to you anyway? Nothing. Well then what's the problem? I don't see why I should have to like her when she's never liked me, she's only here cause she's trying to piss me off. Or maybe, maybe, she's here because she wants to help. You can think whatever you like Denny, I don't care at this point. I guess I'll see you later then. Yeah whatever it's not exactly sunny. It's a disguise. Not a good one, we're not in Hawaii, we're not exactly gonna blend in by wearing them. Just put them on, never hurts to be cautious. So how are you Ann? I'm fine thank you. How about you? Yeah good yeah... Ann do you know how long Jane will be? No why would I? Dunno I just thought it'd be worth asking. Well she'll be late, she always is, I wouldn't expect her anytime soon, doesn't really matter when Frank isn't even here. He actually likes to go by Jesus two now Two? Where did the two come from? I'm assuming, from him being the second coming of Jesus. Right, well when's he gonna be here? Well he's usually here by now but seeing as we scared him in the forest, he's probably not going to come at all. He'll be here. What if he isn't? Stuart, he'll come. He better. Probably doesn't think we're stupid enough to follow him around in public like this. And we wouldn't, unless we didn't have any other options. It's like when we followed him home, You followed him home? And where is his home exactly? In the forest, in that tent, or at least it was I have a feeling he's moved by now. We could follow him to where he is now? No. Ann, do you think I'm right? No, I'm with Denny, I'm fed up of all this messing about. Seriously? Yes People, people, do not fret, seriously enough fretting. Jesus two is here! Ann how long do you think jane will be? now listen up you so-called people Ann. Ann! What? How long will Jane be? I don't know, she's probably still in bed, how late was she last time like 15 minutes? Well that was pretty good for her, she's normally like 30 minutes late for work at least. Why don't they fire her? Why do you think Stu? Because our boss is an old perry man. Oh yeah, okay yeah I get it. I was kind of hoping she'd be here to assist with the plan to be honest. Quite frankly Denny I think your so-called plan in honesty is fucking ridiculous and equally likely to fail with or without Jane. To be fair Ann, the speaker thing wasn't Denny's idea. What? Yeah, Jane came up with it. Oh great, that's fucking brilliant, she's in command is she? Well I don't see any brilliant ideas from you. Why can't I just go and talk to him? Cause a lot has changed Ann, he's a different person. It's only been a year. And a lot can change in a year. Why can't I just talk to him and if it doesn't work then we can follow Jane's ludicrous plan. No we'll stick to our plan, your plan can be the backup, okay? What do you mean? Listen, Stuart and I will head round the back of the church and we'll start the sound effects, you'll wait at least five minutes okay? And if he doesn't head round the back of the church, then you can do whatever you want to do. Fine. We'll meet you around the back of the church as soon as he gets round there alright? Yes. I told you many times before but I'll say it once again, I ain't just your Jesus, if you understand then you will call me henceforth, Jesus two! Ooh-a-ooh I am Jesus Two! And I am here to bring love to you!! Ooh-a-ooh I am Jesus Two! And I am here to bring love to you, and you Dooby-doo I am Jesus Two, and I'm the messiah who is brand spanking new! Dooby-doo, yeah I am Jesus Two, and if you want salvation better get in the queue! You look at me, and what do you see? A son of God, acting carefree! And all around things are falling down, but on my face you will see no frown because ooh-a-ooh I am Jesus Two! Stop it!! Shut up! Shut up! Ann, will you get the rope from the - Stuart's bag please. Ann get Stuart's - Get the rope! Fine, I'll do it myself! Frank, Frank can you hear me? You're moving like a little fish! Umm, Denny, could you get me the duck tape please? Yeah, could you rip off a piece for me? Yeah just a little, enough to cover his mouth. You really shouldn't have worn a goatee. yeah I think we did good there Denny. You alright there Ann? Didn't want to help with the rope at all, yeah? I bet Jane would have bloody helped. Yeah well Jane didn't fucking show up did she? I think we could do with the disguises. Hold him then! I am! Remind me Denny, what the fuck was it we're meant to be? Roman soldiers. Oh great, because for a second there I thought we were going as tourists in Disneyland. I thought they were pretty good. They'll do the job, alright? Oh definitely, it doesn't even look slightly suspicious on us. Just put the disguise on Ann! No! Listen Ann, snap out of it okay? All we need to do is get Frank out of here and you can bitch and moan all you like alright? When in Rome Ann. We're not in fucking Rome. Can I speak to him now? I don't think that's a good idea Well why not? I just don't... How is he? Oh he's all right Stuart, just a little bit upset you know considering he's been kidnapped and all Good to see you Jane! You too, sorry I missed the whole kidnapping thing, I slept in. Though my plan went perfectly I assume? Yeah, yeah, it was fine. Good. So how are you Jane? Fine. I'm still waiting on that wristband though. Did you even send it to her Stuart? Yes I posted it the other day! First class or second? I don't know, does it matter? Yes it matters otherwise there wouldn't be a division between the two postage stamps now would there? Alright, alright it was second okay? They were the only stamps I had. Why didn't you just... Give me one in person? Why couldn't we just give her one in person Stuart? You told me to mail it! get Jane a wristband! Denny I've had enough of your bullshit I want to talk to Frank. I know Ann, and I don't have a problem with that it's just you need to let him calm down first. What if I speak to him? How is that that gonna help? Well he doesn't know who I am so I might be able to talk him down why don't I speak to him first, since I missed the whole kidnapping thing? No no none of this is gonna help just everyone just shut the fuck up please. Denny, I'm going in there. No you're not! So what Denny? What do you mean what What are we doing here? We're waiting. What about the three-step plan to rehabilitation? Yeah Denny, why don't you tell us all about this three step plan you have to save Frank. Oh, you don't want to hear about that yet it's just, you don't need to worry about it alright? Oh, great, thanks that but I think I'd rather know if you don't mind exactly what you're planning. Oh it's fine honestly look it's not a precise plan yet. It was a precise plan before, it was a very precise three step plan to rehabilitation, so let's fucking hear it. The plan is in constant development and I can't do much about that okay? Well let's just hear it as it is now. Fine. Step one then. Step one was to capture him, and we've done that so - Not sure that counts but fine, step two. Step two was to wipe his mind. And what super spy gadget will you be using for that then? Right, forget it, I knew you'd be like this Ann. No go on, I want to hear all three steps of this fabulous rehabilitation regime. You can be such a bitch sometimes Ann. Step three, shoot. Step three was to relocate him, in a small village in Scotland somewhere. And you thought I'd be alright with that did you? Well if it means that much to you, you can go with him. He doesn't need a new identity Denny he's Frank, not Jesus two. Try telling him that! I'm trying but someone won't let me through! I can't, not yet Right then, that's that. It's about time, that while we wait that we celebrate! What are we celebrating, kidnap? Yes, successful kidnap, you got him didn't you? Why don't I go and get the wine? Red or white Denny? Oh, what do you prefer? Red of course, malbec if you have it. Might do, I'll see what I can do! On second thought, he may need a hand carrying those glasses Ann, don't do it seriously. Why not? Because if Danny comes back I hate to think what he'd do. And what about what he'll do if I don't help Frank. He told you he has a plan. He doesn't have the resources to wipe someone's fucking mind Stuart. Well he's working on it! Working on it how? He's lost it all right? Oh it's my dad, did you want to say hi? Alright son, how's it going? Thought I better check how you were, and where you were! Yeah it's fine actually, yeah I'm here with Denny, and Ann, did you want to say hi? The one and only Ann Pomeroy! How could I say no! Hello there, I'm Stu's dad, he's told me all about you! Nice to meet you! Hope you lot aren't getting up to too much mischief there! Oh, only if you count kidnapping as mischief. Very funny! So when you coming round to our new place then eh? Have a proper introduction! Oh, umm, that'd be great, would love to. We'll have you round for dinner yeah? I make a mean beef bourguignon don't I lad? He does! I'm sure.. Haven't unpacked all the glasses yet so it'll have to be wine from a plastic cup, but other than that it'll be good to finally meet you. Mmmm... Yeah, yeah, sounds great - I've just got to pop to the bathroom actually Alright, not a problem, see you soon then eh? Yep. Cheer up Ann. Hey! Malbec! Let's get pished! I feel like we should really be drinking cider in honor of capturing Frank. Yes, yes you're so right Wait, why? Come on Stuart. Cider Stuart, what's it made of? Oh yeah I get it now, you don't have to be so patronizing where's the cider then? I don't have any Why not? Well I always feel like it's a bit too apple-y. Ah yes, unsurprisingly Hey guys guess what I just remembered? What? Frank's video camera. Have you got it? Yeah, just wait. What's on it? Wait a minute! Ann? Are you alright? No, I'm not. I think she needs more to drink. Honestly I just want to talk to Frank And you know what, I don't even think I like red wine. White wine then? Denny have you got any white wine in the fridge? White wine? Sure I got white wine! sure Wow Ann, d'you want white wine? Okay you better be ready for this I think I've got it. Bloody hell, fancy! That's enough, that's fine. Ann, I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. But I am, I'm not the man that I know you once loved. Yes you are Frank, you've just lost yourself. I'm not Frank I'm Jesus Two. Why did you run away from me? I'm sorry for that - Why did you run? Because I didn't want you to see me like this, because I wanted to forget to you because I had to become the Messiah! You're not Jesus. No, no I'm Jesus Two - No you're not. I'm sorry if you don't believe me but I am and you now, hanging around with those heathens, back to the life of a Holy Redeemer they just said they'd help me find you I'm not with them. Good, because let me tell you right now those three are not going to heaven, but you Ann, you could still be saved. Right, and you'll be my Savior will you? I can be more than that, I'm not just Christ I'm Christ Two - And that means I'd have to become a Christ-two-ian? You don't have to become anything, Ann Just stay good What are you all planning to do with me? I don't know, Denny said he wants to rehabilitate you. But please, tell me you won't let him. No. Let me go then, and I promise you I can I can offer you a priority pass to heaven, front of the queue! I'd like to think I can get there by myself. Money then - I've got a shit-ton of money, I mean I could fill a whole bloody pool with... Money. No you can't, and besides I don't want money. Then what the fuck do you want I just want you back, I just want things to go back to how they were, because I don't know anymore... I don't know what I am without you. You don't need me Ann. I do, I just don't understand what's happened to you I saw the light, that's all and if you let me out of here I promise you I can explain everything. Ann, what are you doing? I'm just talking to Frank. Ann you need to get the heck out of here before Denny sees you In a minute... Ann, get out of here now! We're watching this idiot dance out there anyway wait a minute, Ann's in this Turn it off. Turn it off!! Well that was... I mean - Jane stop. Stop what? Stop talking for one goddamn minute! Ann! Please don't. Is there a problem? Yes, and it's called blasphemy. I need another drink. I don't think we've got any more wine. Then we drink spirits, because we're simply not pissed enough If you say so, yeah. Come on then me and Denny are popping upstairs for a minute, and Danny's gonna show me his real sword That video - I don't want to talk about it. Do you want a cup of tea? Sure I'm leaving now. You're letting me go? And taking you with me, yes. Okay if you get me - First I need you to promise me something. Promise you what? I don't care who it is that you think you are now but whoever is that I'm talking to I need you to promise me that you won't betray me I need to know that I can trust you so I can bring back my Frank. Alright, I get it, I promise and if I do betray you, you can slap me around the face! Alright. Now let me out of these! Is that the way out? Ann! Frank! Frank! the time is quarter to twelve and the weather is looking pretty gloomy, it's the perfect day for staying inside if you possibly can lots of fog overhead and while the sun may peak through later, it's not exactly the best day for a teddy bear picnic. Wrap up warm and make sure you get your five a day. Hi there, my name is Dicky Pearson, and I admit it, I have an addiction. It's something I've suffered with for as long as I can remember, because I spend all day doing it I spend all night thinking about it. I am addicted, addicted... To cleaning your windows! But not just to cleaning your windows, also to offering you the lowest most insane prices for window cleaning you have ever seen! But it doesn't stop there, because windows are my life. I also can't sleep unless I am there at your door within an hour of your call, 24 hours a day. So damn it, call Dicky Pearson's window cleaning company, because only Dicky comes in under an hour. Half an hour even, I'm not doing anything else. I'm just here waiting. What are you doing? I'm eating. An apple? Yes? Why? Why am i eating an apple? Yeah. It's just an apple, I don't get your issue Where are your parents? I'm not four, I'm allowed out the house of my own. And you leave the house, to be by yourself, to eat an apple? Yes what is your deal? I will call the police on you! Will you? Yes, if you just want the Apple then take the goddamn apple! I don't want the Apple I just want an answer that makes sense! What is your problem? I just want to be in this park, on my own, eating this Apple. Right, of course you do. Sorry to bother you. Hey what the hell do you think you're doing... Frank? Who? Frank what on earth are you doing here? Nothing, I was just passing by and I - Get up. What for Just get up. How long have you been following me for? Watching me? Not long I... I'm... sorry Can we please go in? For teas? Why couldn't we have just gone for tea in the first place. Why did you have to run from me again? I didn't want to, I just got scared. Scared?! I wanted to apologize, I want to make amends, give you some of the answers you wanted. Don't run away from me ever again. Understood. You wouldn't have any biscuits, would you? No. That's fine, that's okay. Do you want to explain yourself? I wasn't trying to be a creep or anything, following you around, I... I was just keeping an eye on you. Why couldn't you just talk to me Frank, that's all I wanted. Sometimes talking is the hardest thing and I'm not Frank it's Jesus two. No it's not. I wanted to thank you letting me go the other day. Well the best way to have shown your appreciation would have been not to run. Well, whatever the case, I'm here now, and I'm ready to answer your questions, as best I can. Alright, did you call the police? On Denny? Yeah. No I didn't. Really? well I try not to hold any grudges, especially against kidnappers. That's very Jesus of you... You know Ann, I know that this isn't the question that you're asking but I think you should know I'm not a Jesus impersonator I don't just think that I'm Jesus. No? Where's your outfit today then? I can wear whatever I want, people are just more accustomed to the conventional Jesus look but I'm not an impersonator and I am NOT delusional either. Are you sure? Yes, I really am Jesus Ann, Jesus Two - I know you're struggling to believe me and I don't blame you but dad did send me down here to deal with the end of the world! Your dad being God right? Yes! So what exactly happened to Jesus one? Oh, he's my brother, dad doesn't trust him anymore with these kind of things he's been drinking - Jesus fucking Christ Frank, what is wrong with you? What happened have you lost your mind? Do you remember who you were? I remember Ann. Well what do you remember? I remember us I remember we grew up together, I remember we spent every day together, I remember loving you... But we were young then. It's only been a year. And a lot can change in a year, in a day even, when God called upon me that's the day I ran away, everything changed. How? When I woke up that morning, all I saw was light, a guiding presence that told me who I am, who I always was, and that's when I was sent forth on a mission to save the rest of mankind, Jesus two style! Alright, well I guess it's time for the burning question then... If you really are Jesus - Jesus Two. Right, if you really are Jesus Two, then I guess there's just one question. You want to uh... Yes, why you, Jesus two, son of God, would be in the middle of a forest in an apple costume. Well, everyone's gotta have a hobby! So Jesus one was into carpentry and Jesus two, a dancing apple? I don't think... It just makes me happy Ann. Do you remember where you got it from? No... I just found it one day... Is that it? Yes... I think so Fine, forget it. Ann, I'm sorry about Frank I'm sorry I can't be Frank for you anymore but I want you to know that I am a son of God because I want you to know that Denny's little gang, all of you, you're all too late to save the world. What do you mean? I mean these Holy Redeemers aren't helping people they are escalating things. What they don't realise, Ann, is that nothing they do matters, that the end of the world comes when we say it does and by the looks of things I think it's about time. Well then what the hell are you doing following me around? Why aren't you preparing for the end of days? Because Ann, if only for the sake of Frank, I think you can still be saved, because even though Frank is gone I want to give you Jesus Two! I don't want Jesus two. When the time comes, you will. When I next see you, Ann, it will be the end of the world. Save the world! Oh, Ann, it's great to see you... Not very convincing Denny. No seriously. Still trying to shift the wristbands I see? Oh it's not hard, Ann, people love wristbands. Do you want another one? That'd be great thanks Uncool. You have thousands. It doesn't make it any less uncool. You need to grow the fuck up Denny. Yeah whatever Ann. You need to stop with this bullshit, do something useful for once. Ann, you don't seem to understand if I give this up, the whole world dies. No it fucking doesn't Denny. I wanted to go bowling finally but Denny's made me come and hand out these wristbands instead. And you are meant to be at work! So are you. Not for an hour, and I'm on my way at least. Where's Stuart? I don't know he got a little bit depressed after you let Frank beat him up, he said he was gonna jump off a cliff for something. What?! He doesn't mean it. How'd you know that? I don't know, he just needs time to think or a moment or whatever you know. What a good friend you are, we need to find him! Why? Well, to stop him jumping off a cliff, come on drop the wristbands and let's go Do you want one first? Come on Ann! Move on Denny! Now where is Stuart most likely to be? Wait, what's going on? We're trying to stop you killing yourself Stu. Oh! I wasn't actually going to jump, no my dad would kill me. See I told you. There must be something wrong Stu. Well yes there kind of is. I didn't like the way that you and Frank beat me up. I'm sorry Stu, but it wasn't my fault It kind of was, you did let him go. Alright, I'm sorry. s There is a way you could make it up to me Ann... What? You could go on a date with me, you could have dinner with me and my dad. I can't Stu, I don't want to go out with you, and I don't want to lead you on either. It's my accent isn't it? No no it's not, we're just not compatible alright? You can be such a bitch sometimes Ann. Sorry. Oh, stop saying sorry! I have a compromise, why don't we all go bowling? Tonight? Yeah. Sure, though now I need to be at work and so do you. I'm taking a sick day. Alright. Right I better be off then. Alright, well we'll text you then. Alright. The time is five to twelve and the weather today is fairly regular across the board there are some spots of Sun in the East but it's mostly cloudy weather around the rest of the country, only a little bit of that pitter-patter rain here and there. It's looking as though the weather should be improving at least as we enter the weekend though so wrap up warm for now but keep those sunglasses at the ready. Up next, we're gonna be playing a requested song from an up and coming local artist. It's quite catchy though we rather like this one. What the fuck are you doing? I'm here for you Ann! How long have you been here? Not long. How the fuck did you get in my house? Oh I just, just climbed through the window, I thought it'd be more dramatic if I descended the stairs at the end of the world, you know? And this smoke, is this your doing? Everything is my doing Ann, I'm Jesus Two! What the fuck is going on. It's the end of days Ann, I've come to get you, I promised! And take me where? To salvation! And what if I don't want your salvation? What do you mean? Well what if I don't want to go with you? If you stay here, Ann, you'll burn... But if you come with me then - You don't seem to quite get it Mr. Jesus Two - I don't want to go anywhere with you! So you're saying no, no to me? No to eternal salvation? I'm telling you to fuck off! You don't understand, you don't know what you're doing! No I don't think you understand Mr. Jesus Two, I'm telling you to fuck off out of my house and yet you're still here! Can I at least get my speaker from upstairs? Fuck off! Frank! Wait! Do you remember the promise you made? Back at Denny's? I said I wouldn't double-cross you. And do you remember what you said I could do, if you did? now wait a second, I can - You alright mate?
