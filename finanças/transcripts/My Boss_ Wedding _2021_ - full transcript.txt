Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the coming together of Anne and Jeffrey. Sorry. Miss Price? Hey, Nicole, sorry to bother you on the weekend. No problem. I was wondering if you could come in early Monday. I want to go over the Metro Media file. I would love to! I have some great ideas I've been thinking... Why are you breathing so heavily? It's just, ah... Jogging. I don't know how you find the time. I have some great ideas on the Metro Media file. I would love to tell you. Wait... Why are you whispering? There's a wedding going on in the park right now and I'm pretty sure they're about to get to that part where they ask, "Speak now, or forever hold your peace." A wedding in a park? Oh! How romantic. Sure. Come on. It must be beautiful. It's, uh, cute. Let me get somewhere I can talk. I really, really, really want to tell you about... I! Am! So! Sorry! Nicole, is everything okay? Miss Price, I gotta run. Congratulations. I don't think that counts. Good morning! Oh, I can't talk. There's work to be done. But it's the weekend. Mm. Good morning. Good morning. Here it is! Here's what? The file that is going to get me the junior-executive promotion. You always say that. You've been trying to get noticed ever since you started here. What's so special about it this time? Well, Kim called me over the weekend wanting me to come in early this morning to give her my ideas for Metro Media. She's trying to land their contract and, uh, she has a big meeting with them... today! Okay... Well, I worked on it all weekend and here it is, so... what do you think? I think it's thick. Well, yeah. I wanted to be thorough. I mean, this is a really important contract, so I figured if I just... Did Kim ask you to do... all that? Well, no. But I took initiative! Initiative? Yeah-huh. 4- You want to know what another saying for initiative is? Jumping to conclusions. Take my advice: don't do anything unless someone tells you to. Even then, wait 'til they ask a second time. For men, it's three. Trust me. You'll be happier. There's Kim now. Good luck! Okay. Morning, everyone. Good morning, Miss Price. No, Nicole, it is not a good morning. It is a great morning. Ooh! You seem happy. After the weekend I've had... Well, while I have you here, I wanted to talk to you about... Do you know that stage of love when everything is just so... amazing? Sure. You feel like you're just floating across the floor. Yeah. It's, ah... magical. It is magical. Yes, I agree but I wanted talk to you... Oh, you can take that fake smile off your face. Fake smile? Nicole, I have no idea why somebody so young and so beautiful can be so... Bah, humbug! about everything romance. So... the schedule? Yeah. You have your lunch with Metro Media today and I have some ideas for the pitch that I... You can cancel that meeting. I landed the contract. Uh... You landed it? Yeah. I mean, yesterday, after our call, I decided why not just take the executives out to dinner? And? And somewhere between the wine and the karaoke, I signed them to a three-year deal. Wow... Congratulations! Thank you. So, all this, much appreciated but not really needed. Oh! I just wanted to show you what I could do if I was given the opportunity. Aw, Nicole. I mean, being a workaholic is so early 2000s. Trust me... I was there. Nowadays, it's all about relationships and... team spirit. Huh. Well, I'm not a workaholic. I'm just highly organized. Well, when was the last time you organized your way into a romantic rendezvous? Huh. Soooo? Don't! Just... Don't.

Thank you. I have 22 minutes left on my lunch break. Is there another song you could play? I can-I can play you something else. What's wrong with that song? It was mine and my boyfriend's song, but we broke up, okay? Aw. You recently broke up with your boyfriend. I'm sorry. Well, it... It wasn't that recent, actually. How long? Like a year ago. What? Yeah, sorry. I couldn't hear you, either. We broke up a little over a year ago, okay? Lady, get over it. You know what? Oh! Okay. Problem solved. Knock yourself out.

Kim has an announcement. Do you think it's about the promotion? Don't know. Could be. You got here just in time. Everybody... I have a big announcement. You have all met my boyfriend, Bradley. Well, Bradley is not my boyfriend anymore. What? He's my fiancé! Oh! Congratulations! Everybody! Whoo! Thank you! Okay, everybody, back to work. Oh, ah, Nicole? Yeah? Can Bradley and I have a moment of your time? Yeah, yeah. Oh! Sorry. My goodness. It's a safety hazard. I'm going to put a sign up later or maybe I'll just get rid of it altogether. Sorry about that! Wow! Congratulations, you guys. This is really... - exciting! - Thank you, Nicole. Thank you. You know Bradley and I have busy schedules. Whoo! Don't I know it. And because of those schedules and some upcoming travel in the next couple of months, we need to pull off this wedding fast. How fast? Two weeks. Yikes! Well, that sure is fast. I'll be sure to respond to my invite A-S-A-P. Um... Oh! My gosh. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to assume that I was invited, I was just... trying to be funny and... Oh, gosh. Oh, no! Of course you're invited. Yeah? Actually, you're more than invited. More? More. What my fiancé is trying to say is that we're going to need some help planning this wedding if we're going to pull it off on time. And you are the most organized person I've ever worked with. So... we were hoping that you would be... our wedding planner. Oh! Listen, Kimmy tells me you're not the biggest fan of romance. Everybody keeps saying that! But I like romance. I do. Romance just doesn't seem to like me very much. Well, that's why I've asked my nephew to help out. I work better alone. Think of him as your assistant? Mm. I still work better alone. Oh, but I've met Bradley's nephew several times. Really sweet kid. Hopeless romantic. Everybody in the family calls him Mr. Romance. Okay... I shouldn't be saying this, but, uh, he's my favourite nephew. Ah! Ooh! He's a bit of a black sheep in a family, uh, full of type-A businesspeople. But he's super sweet. And easy on the eyes, if you know what I mean. - Runs in the family. - Oh! Ohhh. Oh! I have so much work to do, maybe... your nephew could handle this on his own? Michael? Sweet kid, just not the most reliable, if you know what I mean? Oh. We were thinking that the two of you would make a great team. Yup, he'll bring the romance and you can bring the focus and organization. Mm. Kind of give this wedding planning the old one-two punch. Uh! I think this is a horrible idea. What? Nicole! I mean, you know I love your unbridled honesty, but I was hoping that you'd be a little bit more... I'm kidding! - Gahhhh! - Oh! I would love to plan your wedding! See? I told you she'd say yes. Ah, perfect! Bradley has organized for you two to meet this morning. - Should be here any minute. - This morning? Nicole, you have to plan a wedding in two weeks. You have no time to waste. Of course. What in the world? There he is now. - That's your nephew? - Yeah. Didn't I tell you he's easy on the eyes. Michael! Come on over here. Hey! You brought dogs! Hey, Uncle Brad! Hi! Kim. Michael, this is Nicole. The woman I was telling you about. You're the woman from the park. And you have dogs. Lots of dogs. I have a dog-walking business. Oh! Wait, you're not allergic, are you? No. No, no. I'm just not the biggest fan of dogs. Ooh. Do you two know each other? - No. - Yeah. We met in the park yesterday. He was playing the guitar and... - Hm. - Huh. This is going to be a lot of fun. Why don't we take 'em for a walk? It'll distract 'em. Come on, guys. Now? I... I have a lot of work to do. Oh! Go for a walk. It'll give you guys a chance to get to know each other. And, Nicole, Bradley and I want this wedding to be... Fabulous! I'll get right on that, Ms. Price. Please... Call me Kim. Okay... Kim. Thanks, Nicole. Oh! What? Going to get a sign for that. Ohh. - You all right there? - Hey, cuties! Let's do it. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. She's good. She's good. So you don't like dogs? Uh, it's kind of a long story and we have a ton of work to do. Yeah, we're planning a wedding. Yes, it's all very exciting. I know, right? I was being sarcastic. You know, Kim and Bradley warned me about you. Warned you? What did they say? I'd rather not say. Well, I'd rather not be walking half a dozen dogs and planning my boss's wedding, so... They said you might be a little apprehensive. Oh! Well, that's true. All right, what have you got here? Hey! How to plan a wedding in ten easy steps. Step one, schedule, schedule, schedule. See? Now that is really great advice. I bet you think so! Kim and Bradley told me about you and your schedules. Well, that's why they asked me to help organize their wedding. And the fact that you're reading articles like this is why they asked me to help. We're going to make an amazing team. Amazing. Yeah... That's the first word that popped into my head. So, sarcasm is your default? Sorry. It's just... I have so much work to do and there's this promotion coming up that I really, really, really want. A-ha! There it is. What? Kim is your boss, so if you do a great job at her wedding, it'll go a long way in having her in your corner come promotion time. Am I right? Thought so. Okay, so you handle the scheduling and planning. I'll take care of the romance, okay? You know, that's what Kim and Bradley said. They called it... "the old one-two punch." What was all of that? - Uh, punches. - Uh-huh. You know, the old one-two punch. You've never thrown a punch before, have you? I've never had to. Okay. Well, uh, leave the romance... And the punching to me. Teamwork. Come on. Come on, Lona. Come on, Lona. Come on. Come on, guys. Teamwork. So, we're walking these dogs and then he's all, like, "So I guess sarcasm is your baseline"? So, he's a fast judge of character is what you're saying. Ha-ha-ha. But don't you think you should know someone better before you say something like that? Once he gets to know you, he'll love you, just like we all do. Great. O-M-G! Look at this dress. Uh... it's a beautiful dress. I love wedding magazines. So, what's the next steps? Um, we're going to go check some wedding venues tomorrow. You're so lucky. Back from the walk so soon? Yeah. Uh, Michael had to get the dogs back. Isn't he great? Sure is! That's what Nicole was saying. Really? 'Cause usually when Nicole says something nice about a guy, she's being sarcastic. Ha! What's wrong with my soon-to-be nephew? Does he prefer Google Docs over Excel? Um, no. We're just two very different people, but I think we'll make a good team. I'm sure you will. And didn't I tell you? He's easy on the eyes. Oh. Those flowers? Hideous. Burn it. Hey. Hey. Good morning. These dresses are gorgeous! You're so lucky. That's what people keep telling me. Oh, come on. Even you can't find a way to hate this. And, yet, I have found so many ways. You should see this guy, Michael. He's... playing guitar one day and walking dogs the next. I mean, who lives like that? So why did you say yes? Because I had no choice. Rule number one... You never say no to your boss. Especially when you want a promotion. Well, it's better than sitting in an office all day. What? Checking out wedding venues with some cute guy. Wait, this Michael guy is cute? You never mentioned that before. Hm. I see what's going on here. What? Maybe you like him? Like him? I barely know him and what I do know is more annoying than anything else. Okay. You go hang out with the cute boy all day and act annoyed by it. Trust me! I would take my schedules and my spreadsheets any day. Look at this photo! These two are so in love. Those are two models who are paid to look that way. Well, these two are definitely in love. Michael! You are so funny! Are you a comedian? Uh, no. Um... I'm a musician. Oh, that's pretty good, too. Some of my music is funny. Unintentionally. Oh! Funny guy. Hey! Hey! Uh, Janette, this is Nicole, the woman I told you about. I'm Janette, the assistant wedding coordinator. Nice to meet you. Mm-hm. Let's get started, shall we? Follow me. She seems, uh... friendly. She was super nice until you got here. I noticed that. Did you say something about me to her? Nothing bad. What did you tell her. That you were a smart, funny executive with a bright future ahead of you. Huh. What did you really tell her? Pachelbel's CanonThat you're an over-organized, anti-romance wedding hater. Oh! I am not an over-organized, anti-romance... Wedding hater. Well, over-organized, okay. But I take that as a compliment. I most certainly am not anti-romance, nor do I hate weddings. Sorry about that. The Davidsons? They are getting married here in a few weeks. Such a cute couple. - So cute. - Ah. Blah. Pardon? I said, "Yeah. Super cute!" Moving along. Hey, I'm trying to get Janette on our side. Getting a venue like this on such short notice is a big ask. I know. I'm sorry! I just... Just do your thing. Okay. Oh, Janette! Um, this place looks very familiar. Was it featured in Wedding Quarterly's Top Ten Venues List? Yes! Oh my gosh. I am so impressed that you noticed. Isn't he amazing? Very amazing. You are a very lucky girl. No, we're not... Oh, you... No, we're not together. Sorry, I just assumed she was your girlfriend. Nope. No girlfriend. Single? Interesting. Hm. Me too. Huh. Ah, um, Janette would you mind showing us where we'll be having the reception? Sure. Follow me. Ah... And the D-J booth usually goes up right there, leaving seating for up to 100 people. Hm. This is stunning, Janette. Oh, yes. It's very... romantic, Janette. I actually have another showing but I will leave you guys some information. It has the pricing and everything else you could need. Great. Thank you. - And Michael? - Yes? This is my cell number... Just in case. Just in case... what? I don't know. Ah, pretty girls just give me their numbers sometimes. I have no idea why. Maybe I should hang on to it, you know? If anybody's going to call with questions, it'll probably be me. I have a surprise for you. Ooh! I guess nobody told you? Told me what? I hate surprises. I have a theory that people who say they hate surprises actually really love them. Nope. I hate surprises. It's on my list, along with, "going with the flow", "trusting in the universe" and overall general spontaneity. Okay. Do you, at least, like sandwiches? - Huh? - All right. Don't hate me. Oh, I don't like the sound of this. I may have just switched your schedule around a little bit. You did what? There is this, ah, place around the corner that makes the most amazing sandwiches. And? And I called the other venues that we're going to see today, and I just moved things around a little bit so that we would have time to grab some lunch. "You" changed "my" schedule? It's going to be worth it. Trust me. Mm-mm. This is a really good sandwich. My dad always said the way to a woman's heart was through her stomach. You could take Janette here on your first date. Yeah. I don't think that's going to happen. She not your type? This might sound cliché, but I may be getting back together with my ex, Julie. Why? She reached out. We started talking. Obviously, there were problems with the relationship, but it was also really amazing sometimes, too. And love is always worth fighting for. Also something my dad taught me. Sounds like you're pretty close to your family. So, the other day, when we met, and I was playing that song... Did I overreact? No, no. I-I get it. That song reminded you of a bad break-up. I should've just put in my headphones. If you had requested something, what would it have been? I'm curious. Like, what kind of music do you listen to? Really obscure stuff. Honestly. Like? Well, a few years ago, I got really into this band out of Portland called Roadside Rescue. Hm. I haven't listened to them, you know, in a few years. So, how do you get roped into planning your uncle's wedding? Why are you changing the subject? You don't want people to know too much about Nicole Waters? Seriously, you must have other things to do? Work? I am taking a little break from work right now. I'm just playing the odd gig, walking dogs here and there. And? And Bradley is the only uncle that I really like. Oh. He said you were a bit of a black sheep in the family? Bradley's always been there for me. So, I want to make sure that this is really special for him and Kim. Hm. Plus, I want to make a good impression on Kim. I mean, she's going to be family now. And I thought this would be really fun. Fun? Planning a wedding is never fun. No, planning your own wedding is never fun. Why do you know so much about wedding planning? Four sisters, no brothers, all married. Oh. Um... Please. There's lots. We could... Here. I'll take this one. Uh, so how did you get roped into planning a wedding? For your boss? Your soon-to-be aunt is great. Honestly. But I've been working for her for a while now and we just haven't found a way to... Gel? Yes! Gel. Exactly. So you think planning her wedding might help? Well, for the first time ever she insisted I call her Kim. So, I guess that's a start? I've only known you a small amount of time, but... it's pretty obvious that you're a smart, focused woman who probably has good ideas. So, you'll be fine. Thanks. You just need to learn how to go with the flow. You know? Trust the universe. Ha, ha, ha. We should probably get going. Ah, there might be traffic and I would hate for us to be late. Look at you! Making time for traffic, planning out schedules. Maybe I'm rubbing off on you. Oh! Why don't you grab that and I will go take care of the bill. Hello? I am just calling to see how you and Michael are doing. Things are going well. Um, we're on our way to Crystal Banquet Hall. Oh, that's my favourite venue. Thank you so much, Nicole. This means a lot to me. Of course, Ms. Price. I told you. It's Kim. It's my pleasure, Kim. Oh! Ah, hold on. I am just getting a text message from my contact over at Crystal Banquet Hall. Oh, what are they saying? No, no, no, no, no, no. What is it? Oh, Kim. I'm sorry but they just gave their last slot to someone else. What happened? I am sorry. I promise we will find you something that is just as good! We'll talk about it in the morning. So, ready to check out venue number two? Um... Who did you talk to over at Crystal Banquet Hall? Who did I talk to? Yeah. When you changed the time of our meeting, who did you confirm it with? Oh, no one. When I called it went to voice mail, so I just left a message. - Oh. - What. What's wrong? Well, Michael, there was a very slim chance that they were going to be able to slip us in and someone else has just booked our date. Sorry, I thought... Knew we should've stuck to my schedule! Well, look, there's a bunch of other places that we're supposed to look at. Why don't we... This was Kim's number one choice. Wh-what are you doing? None of these other places will do. So... I'm going to make a new list. I'm going to find us something even better. I'm sorry. But you can still go do the rest of the tours. Maybe, um, find us a back-up. I'm going to find a way to fix this. I was really just trying to help. I didn't... Ah, I told them I work better on my own. Wow. Okay. Hi. Is this Summer Ranch and Events? I, uh, could I please check your schedule? Yes, I'll hold. - Hey! - Hey. So, how did it go? I never want to see another banquet hall or photo garden again. Oof. Wow! These are beautiful. Yeah. The venues were beautiful. Quick sidenote... Expensive as heck. I can imagine. Oh, you don't have to imagine. The prices are right there on the back pages. Yikes. Well, at least you had the nephew to help you out. Yeah... That didn't exactly work out. He changed my schedule and we lost Kim's favourite venue. Why did he change your schedule? Had you made a mistake? Seriously? Me? Mistake? Right. He wanted to go to a sandwich shop! A sandwich shop? In all fairness to him, it was an awesome sandwich and... it was kind of nice getting to know him. He actually seems like a good guy. That sounds promising. Nope. Not promising. What did you do? What I always do. You pushed him away and told him you work better on your own? - Bingo! - Nicole! What? I do work better on my own. But, ugh... I feel kind of bad about how I treated Michael. Well, can you fix it? The Michael situation or the Kim situation? Both? I'd better. There is a lot riding on this. I can't let Kim down and I don't want to mess up this wedding. Uh! And now I have to go into work tomorrow and tell Kim why she can't have her favourite wedding venue. I'm sure she'll understand. Yeah. Kim will understand. I don't understand. There was a mix-up with one of my schedules. A mix-up? With one of your schedules? I don't believe it. Unfortunately, it's true. Oh, we loved that place. So did Michael and I. Wait... Did Michael mess things up? Michael? Yeah. I mean, the Nicole I know doesn't make mistakes but Michael, on the other hand, well... Um... Actually... No. It wasn't Michael. It was me. I made a Mistake. Sure. Okay, well, no more mistakes. I need you two to go pull a few wedding dress options for me. Wedding dress options? Yeah. I mean, if I go myself, I will be there for days. So I just need you to weed out the ugly ones. Okay. I'm thinking... trumpet fit and flare. What do you think? Uhhhh... Trumpet fitted and...? Trumpet fit and flare. Michael will know what I'm talking about. Trumpet fit and flare. Peter! It is so nice to see you. Nicole, you know our CEO, Mr. Banks. Oh! Uh, only by name, sir, but it's very nice to meet you. Ah, yes. The young lady helping out with wedding plans. That's me! That's me, sir. I think it's great that you're helping Kim out. And planning a wedding in two weeks? I tell you, if you pull this off... "When" I pull this off, sir. "When" you pull this off... I'll be very impressed. Well, on that note, I have a date. With some wedding dresses. You know, the dress is the most important part. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Very nice to meet you, sir. Bye-bye. Please pick up. Please pick up. Please pick up! Hello? Michael! Thank goodness you picked up. It's Nicole. Who? Nicole. Kim's assistant. We're planning a wedding together? That's funny. I was planning a wedding with someone named Nicole but we parted ways yesterday because she works better on her own. About that... I'm sorry. I was way too... intense. It's okay. I get it. Doing a good job is important to you. You have no idea. Are you free right now? Can we meet up? Yeah, I'm just at a coffee shop. I can send you the address. Great. But you might have to wait until I finish a set, though.

I was curious what kind of music you listen to so I looked them up. They're good, right? - Yeah. - And you? I mean... You did an amazing job with their song. Well, thank you. I can't believe you remembered. Just think of it as my way to apologize for messing up your schedule. You were just trying to do something nice and... There was no way for you to know that we'd lose the venue. Michael. Charlie. So, what did you think? Very okay-ish. Okay? Are you kidding? That was amazing! A place like this should be lucky to have him. Nicole, I would like you to meet Charlie. - Hm. - As in Charlie's Coffee Shop. Also known as the guy who hires me. Least I used to. Oh. My. Gosh. I am so sorry! I didn't know. Just pulling your leg, young lady. Charlie and I go back a long time. Yeah. Longer than I care to admit. Just messing with each other. Oh... Oh, my goodness! Wow.

You know, I-I can never really tell with that guy. Hm. I will have a black coffee, please. You? Sure. The same. Thank you. Look at you! Making friends everywhere you go. Oh, I didn't mean to. Do you think he's really mad? Meh. 50-50. Oh. Charlie's fine. What is up with you? Okay. Listen... I really need your help with this wedding. Oh... Kay. You know so much more about this stuff than I do. I mean, heck! I think you know more about this stuff than most people. Guilty. I mean, there's the-the wedding venue, the wedding cake, caterers, music, flowers! Reception, first dance, menu, invitations, - photographer, videographer... - Okay, I get it. There is a boatload of stuff that we have to do. Wait... we? Look, I can organize the heck out of anything. But... I really need this wedding to be something special. And that's where I come in. You see, I bring the magic. Well, I said special but if you need to use the term magic, then knock yourself out. Honestly, we're going to need a little bit more than just magic to pull this off. We're going to need a miracle. We? Okay, yes. I will help you plan this wedding. Great! Okay, here's what I have for a plan of attack. Ahhh. You made... You made charts? Graphs? Yeah, I made charts and graphs and schedules! Doesn't everybody? No. Hey! Thank you. On the house. - Oooh. - It's your lucky day. We are going to need it. Yes, we are. Here's to a wedding miracle. To a miracle wedding. That's hot. So, decided to start with something easy, huh? Kim just wanted us to pull a few dresses for her. Hello. I'm Vicky. Hi. I'm Nicole. We spoke on the phone earlier. Yes! Pulling a few designs for your boss. Yeah. And this is Michael. - Hi. - He's here to help. Excellent. Well, uh, before we get started, do you have any idea of what your boss is looking for? Something pretty. Something pretty? Yeah. With one of those long things at the back, you know? - A train? - Yes, that's it. A train. The bride wants a train. Yeah. Maybe. A really, really long one. Oh, and can you do pockets? So, your boss wants something pretty with a long train and pockets? Yeah. I mean, that sounds like a pretty good place to start. And for the silhouette? - The silhouette? - Well, what's her body type. Kim's body type... Voluptuous? Voluptuous. Yes! That's the word. So, no A-lines. Perhaps an empire? Uh-huh. You're doing a great job, but do you mind if I take over from here? Please. Yes, the bride is a bit voluptuous, so an empire would be great. Or maybe a trumpet fit and flare. Oh, yes! The trumpet thing! She mentioned that. Great. So, we'll start with a trumpet fit and flare... I'm thinking scoop neck, sleeveless? Fabric? Jersey. Or chiffon. You really know your dresses. Let me guess... Three older sisters? Four. I think we may have something. Have a seat and I'll be right back. Oh, and, uh, let's hold off on the pockets, for now. Ah! Fine. I like pockets.

Look at you picking up the lingo. Try it on! I'll show you. Oh, no. That's... That's not necessary. It'd be good for you to see what these dresses look like - on people. - Really? It might help you to pick a better dress for your boss. They say the dress is the most important part of the wedding. Okay. Yeah, I'll try some on. Quickly. Julie, I'm sorry! Something came up, okay? Yes, it was last minute. I'm really sorry that you feel that way. Vicky? Vicky. I can't seem to do up this strap. Here, I... I can help you with that. I, uh, thought you were on the phone. I was. You look stunning. Oh! Well, it is a very pretty dress, and I can see why most women like these things. The dress is okay, but... You? You make it sing. How are we making out in here? We're not making out. I meant with the dress. Oh! Um...? She looks beautiful. Whew! Yep. Yeah, okay. So, we have two trumpet fit and flares and a more traditional empire, one of which she will probably take. Probably. And... just in case she doesn't, we have a ball gown and a mini dress because, well, it's Kim. You guys have done a really good job. We'll put those aside for your boss and when she's ready, she can come by. Thanks, Vicky. Okay! So, what's next on our schedule? Oh! Our day is packed. We should probably get moving. Can you take care of the details here? I need to make a quick phone call. - I'll meet you by the car? - Yeah. Thanks again, Vicky. Um, I was wanting to ask: do you ever do sales? - No. - Hm.

She's back. - One little bite. - But would Kim like it? - I don't get it! Hm. I think this is the one. I think this is the one. This is the one. We have to book this place. I can't believe it's still available! We need to book this. We need to book this. Okay. Keep your cool. We gotta negotiate a good price. Okay. So, what do you two think? - Meh. - Meh. I mean, it's kinda nice. I guess. It could be, ah... Nicer. Or bigger. Right. Yeah, I don't know that this is going to really work. Maybe if the price was good? Here's the price list. Ooh! Wow! Okay. Yeah, we're going to need a little wiggle room if we're going to take it. I have two other parties interested in the space and they're looking at it this afternoon. We'll take it! Well, we did it. We got ourselves a venue. One thing down. 927 more to go. Come on! Even you've got to be excited about this! Trust me, I couldn't be happier. If I'd made one more mistake, think Kim might have fired me. You told Kim it was your fault we lost the first venue? - Yeah. - Why? It was my mistake. Look, she might be my boss, but you're going to be family. You don't want to start off on the wrong foot, right? Thanks. I may not be the "free spirit" you are but I can still be pretty cool. So I'm starting to see. So, why are you this... "free spirit"? Free spirit? I was being polite. Thank you. Were your parents hippies? - Ah! - I knew it! No, the opposite actually. Corporate types. My whole family is. Like your Uncle Bradley? Hm. So you were the black sheep from birth? No, I was a suit-and-tie guy, too. What happened? Well, uh, when I was in college my dad got really sick... Passed away. Michael, I'm sorry. I didn't... It's okay. It was a long time ago. But it made me realize that life is short, you know? Can turn on a dime. It's true. My entire family is CEO types, big-shot lawyers. Every time we have a family vacation it always turns into this competition about who's driving the more expensive car or who bought a vacation house where. I can see how that would be annoying. But, as a kid, that's all I wanted. Suit, tie, briefcase. And then your father passes away. And I realized that no matter how much money you make or however hard you work, it can all end in a second. So, why not have fun instead? So, you started to look at things a little differently. Yeah. I picked up the guitar, started singing in public. Just doing all of the things that I always wanted to do but I was too scared to. Well, you, uh, got pretty good at the singing part, too. Well, thank you. I want my life to be more about experiences than money. So, is this where the idea of "Mr. Romance" came to be? No, uh, I've been a hopeless romantic since junior high. Ah. You know, deep down, I think everybody is a romantic. Yeah, present company included. Really? Really. Sometimes you just have to dig a little deeper. Oh! Bradley! Hi! Nicky. Hey, great job on the wedding venue. Kim and I love it. Thanks. I'm happy to help. Is she around? - Uh... - If by "she" you mean your future wife, then "she" is right here. Pumpkin. Sugar bear. Mwah. Ah, Nicole, you know that Bradley and I have been so impressed with everything you've been able to accomplish. Especially on such short notice. I feel like there's a "but" coming. No, we're really happy with everything so far. Oh. - But... - Ah. We would love to add one thing to your plate. Oh! Okay. See, I told you she'd be fine. Bradley and I would like you and Michael to plan a small little engagement party. An engagement party? - Yeah. - Yeah. Nothing crazy, just a few dozen family members. Uh-huh. Yeah, Bradley and I were hoping to get away without doing one, but a lot of family have been asking to meet before the big day. - Yeah. - Again, nothing crazy. Maybe a private room at a really nice restaurant? - Okay. - Just close family and maybe a few executives from this firm? Executives from this firm? Obviously, you and Michael would be invited, too, and I think you two should bring dates. - Oh. - Oh, Sugar Bear. Nicole doesn't do the dating scene. - Hm. - Neither does Michael. - Really? - But he's so cute! Yeah, he's all about romance, but when it comes down to actually asking a woman out, he's, uh... No-such-luck. - Huh. - So, Nicole, do you think that this is something that you and Michael can pull off? Oh! An engagement party? Ha-ha. That's no problem. Great. Bam. Bam. Whoosh. Bam? An engagement party? That's crazy. I know, but they really want it and I can't let Kim down. I know a few restaurants I can reach out to. Leave it to me. Great. Michael, I would not be able to pull this off without you. I... I owe you one. Well, actually, I was about to give you a call. Yeah. What's up? I need a favour. Oh. Sure. Anything. You're not going to like it. Come on. Come on. Yes. Yes. Come on. No! Don't eat that. All right, let's go this way. Come on. Come on, Corgi. Now, this is a sight to see. I feel like I should take a picture. Don't you dare. I thought you didn't like dogs? I'm warming up to them. I think, uh... I think Thorgi likes me. Thorgi is a good judge of character. I really appreciate this. Thank you. You owe me big time. I just had a meeting with a club owner. They want to hire me to play two nights a week. Oh, my gosh! That's amazing! - Congratulations. - Thank you. There's record executives in there all the time. Like, this could turn into something really big for me. I'm so happy for you! Oh, we're doing that? Okay, well, I couldn't have done it without you. Well, I wouldn't be pulling off this wedding stuff if it wasn't for you, so we're even. Still, I know you don't love dogs, so I feel like, maybe, I owe you dinner or something? Dinner like a... Like a date? But I... I thought you and your ex were...? We tried. It's not going to happen. How could it not work out? You are such an amazing guy. Thank you. But I could say the same for you. What do you mean? Well, we've been working together on this wedding for a while now and, I don't know, from my perspective, you are... you're smart, you're funny, you're beautiful, you're passionate about your work. Guilty as charged. So... What's the deal with you not having a boyfriend? I don't know. I mean, other than you're dislike of dogs, I can't see anything wrong with you. I wasn't always Miss Grumpy Pants about romance. I just thought my last boyfriend was "the one", you know? I know the feeling, sure. But when I'd ask him about our future together, he'd... always say he wasn't ready to get married, and... And? Well, the break-up crushed me. I'd always pictured us getting married, buying a house, having kids. You know, the whole nine yards. Okay, but, I mean, everybody has bad break-ups. It's no reason to turn your back on love. Well... like a month after we broke up, I saw that he was engaged to his ex. Ah. So, it wasn't that he didn't want to get married. It's just that he didn't want to get married to me. I'm sorry. Wow. So, I guess planning a wedding wasn't exactly on the top of your to-do list? No, it wasn't. There it is. What? Your laugh. I love it when I make you laugh. Um... So, Kim and Bradley's engagement party? Yes, the engagement party. Uh, so... come on, guys... I called... I called a couple of places. What I found out is that there are a million people trying to get space right now, but we have a good shot... - Oh, yeah? - 'Cause Kim has a lot of money. And they like money. - They do. They do. - That's the way it works. Yeah, so, we'll see. Money makes the world go 'round, right? - Hey! - Hey! How's the wedding stuff going? Good. We found a venue, we locked down a bunch of vendors... cake, flowers, DJ. And I even walked Michael's dogs for him. But you hate dogs? I know, but he needed a favour. So, team Nicole and Michael seems to be working out? Oh, I could not have done this without Michael. What was that? What? You just smiled and tucked your hair behind your ear when you said Michael. You only do that when you like people. You like Michael? What? No! No, I don't. Don't be weird. Me weird? You're weird. You're having marshmallows for dinner. Okay, don't change the subject. Do you like Michael? No, we're just... Wedding planning buddies. Huh. Huh, what? Nothing. Just curious. You said "buddies", not "friends". So? Well, most people would have said "friends", not "buddies". Oh, eat your marshmallows! I'm just wondering if you're not trying to friend-zone this guy. Well, what's wrong with having male friends? Nothing. So long as it doesn't prevent you from finding a boyfriend. Michael's just a really nice guy. You just did it again! Oh! So? But wait, I thought he was trying to get back together with his ex? Hm. Yes, yes, yes. That did not work out. You like him. Ah! There you are. What are you doing? People are starting to get here. Um... Just, um... Whoa! Why do you look so nervous? I'm fine. Wait, is there... Is there a problem I should know about? No, I'm good. I'm good. Did we forget to order dessert? No. Dessert is here. So, what's up? It's just... My family... Well, they should be arriving any minute. That's the problem! I don't do well with family get-togethers. At least, not when it's my own family. I know family can be difficult. They're just, they're so successful. And I'm... Amazing. Listen, I've had to spend a lot of time with you these last few days and you are... a really amazing guy. You hated me the first time that we met. Oh, first impressions don't count. Really? Well, maybe most of them do, but not this one. Seriously, do you not see what a great person you are? - Yeah. You know, you're right. - Hm. Besides, they're all on their third marriage, anyway, so what do they know, right? Well, I know that you are the guy who helped me pick out a wedding dress the day after I yelled at him. True. The dress, the cake, the flowers... All the things that people are going to really love, I mean, that's all you. You really helped me. And Kim, by the way, through all of this. Thank you. So, let's get out there and give them the old... Whap-ah!... one, two punch. Ha! - Okay. - Go! All right. Thank you. I'm going to go. I will be right behind you. Ooh! Look out. Oh! That-a-way! Hi. You are doing a horrible job at trying to hide. Maybe if I go hide in the bathroom? They'll find you. I meant the bathroom in my apartment. See, just go take that wit and humour and go talk to somebody. Nope. Uhh! Well, I've talked to a bunch of your family and they seem nice. Hey, Mikey! How the heck are you? Uncle Trevor. I'm good. This is Nicole. Nicole, this is Bradley's brother, Trevor. It is so nice to meet you. She your girlfriend? No, we're just friends. And work? You're still playing guitar in subway stations for pocket change? I also get free coffee when I work at coffee shops. Why don't you just come and work for me? I already have a job. He is, actually, an amazing musician. You know, he just booked a gig- It's okay, Nicole. What time is it? Oh! Here... Let's have a look at my really expensive watch. Will you look at that? It's time for someone to grow up. Hey, I will tell you something, sir- Nicole, it is okay. I'm going to say hi to your cousins. The wife and I bought a cottage this summer and, uh, I'm going to go tell them about it. Hm. So, you're Uncle Trevor's a jerk. Thank you for trying to stick up for me but it's just not worth it. Trust me. Let's mingle. You know, I think I'm going to go get some fresh air. Nicole. You remember Mr. Banks. Yes. Mr. Banks, it's so good to see you again. You as well, Nicole. Kim tells me things are coming along swimmingly. Oh. Yes, sir. Nonsense. Nicole here is being humble. Bradley and I wouldn't be able to put any of this together without her help. Very impressive. You know, we have a promotion coming up soon. We always want to add new people to our team. Well, I mean... I would love an opportunity to prove myself, Mr. Banks. Well, maybe we should all sit down some time and discuss it? Sounds good. Sounds good. Let me introduce you to some of my future in-laws. Thank you. Don't be silly. We'll still be able see each other. Of course. Just not as much. Honey Bunny, you are the most important woman in the world to me. Hey, I told you... it's a different kind of love with Kim. It's true. I will always love you. It'll just be a few weeks until things settle and then we can plan our next secret adventure. Anywhere you want to meet, Honey Bunny. Of course. I promise. I love you. Okay. Yes. Can't talk now, Trevor! Michael! Hey, there you are. I was looking for you. Michael, I need to talk to you. Can it wait until tomorrow? I gotta drive a couple people home. No, I need to talk to you now. What's up? Hey, you two. I just wanted to thank you again for a lovely evening. It was our pleasure. Yeah. Happy to help. Michael, I think I'm going to fit in so well with your family. They all love you. Are you leaving? Yeah, I have to drive a couple people home. Oh, but you're staying? - Yeah. Yeah. - Great. Oh, there was something you wanted to talk to me about? Nope. Uh, nothing important. We can talk about it tomorrow. Okay. Are you sure? It seemed pretty important. Is everything okay? Yeah. Everything is great. Uh, it's just one little, teensy, weensy, little... detail. Okay, great. So give me a call tomorrow, all right? - Yeah. - Thank you. Congrats, Kim. And there is my handsome fiancé. - Ladies. - Mm. Isn't he amazing? Yeah. Amazing! - Are you sure? - Yes! Are you absolutely sure? Yes! Are you positive, 'cause... No. Well, yes! I know what I heard. Last night your uncle told another woman that he loved her. But you didn't see this woman? Well, he was on the phone. But I heard him call her "Honey Bunny." And they talked about secret meetings. Come on, Bradley. The one uncle I actually looked up to. And everybody asks me why I'm so cynical about love. I mean, huh! This is horrible. I will talk to Bradley. You need to tell Kim. I know. But... What? But she is so happy. And our boss, Mr. Banks? He seems to be really impressed with all the work I've been... We've been doing, putting this wedding together so quickly. So? Well, he alluded to the idea that I might be up for a promotion. And if I tell Kim now that her fiancé is cheating on her, I mean... That'll ruin everything. Bradley cheating on Kim is ruining everything. This isn't on you. You're going to put off telling your friend... My boss. You're not going to tell her because you think it might jeopardise your chances at a promotion? Nicole. Okay. I will tell Kim. She's my family, after all. Wait, Michael... It'll just be worse coming from you. I'm the one that overheard the call. I should be the one to tell her. Promise me you won't talk to your uncle? Sure. Whatever. Just give me a few days and I will figure everything out. Look, I get that you're this super-cynical person when it comes to romance and marriage. And maybe the idea of someone cheating on their fiancé days before their wedding is a reason to justify - continuing to feel that way. - Michael. But for the rest of us, this is important. Marriage, romance. Love? These things do exist, Nicole, whether you want to believe in them or not. Or maybe I was right to be skeptical all these years. Maybe we live in a world where "true love" just doesn't exist? People fall in love, Nicole. Yeah, well, prove it. Up until five minutes ago I thought I was falling in love with you. Michael, I... I am going to fix this. I will tell her. I promise. Just give me a few days. Cool. I'll hold off on talking to Bradley until you tell Kim. I really hope you make the right decision, Nicole. He said he was in love with you? He said he was falling in love with me, but he hadn't fallen. And now? He's not picking up his phone or answering his texts. So what are you going to do? I mean, he's right. I need to tell Kim. But she's so... happy. And then there's this promotion and... I just need some time to work something out. Maybe Kim will figure out that Bradley's cheating on her own? Nicole... I'll figure it out. I always do. And Michael? Well, apparently, he's not my biggest fan right now. But there's only a few things left to take care of before the wedding and... I'll handle them on my own. This thing with you and Michael stopped being about wedding planning a long time ago. He said he was falling in love with you? Yeah. Well, it doesn't really matter anymore, does it? Unless... you were falling for him, too. Kim? Hi, Mr. Banks. Kim... Can I talk to you about something, privately, for a moment? Maybe in your office? Perfect timing, Nicole, because there is something that I would like to talk to you about, as well. Okay. Look, the thing is I... You got the promotion! Congratulations. You earned this, Nicole. Your attention to detail, your meticulous planning, your teamwork. You have done so much for this company. And, on a personal note, you've done so much for Bradley and I. This wedding is going to be the best day of my life. And I owe it all to you. Thank you. I, um... I don't know what to say. I am so happy right now. I'm sorry. What-what is it that you wanted to talk to me about? Um... It can wait. Congratulations. Michael. I hear you got a promotion. Michael, I... It's okay. I get it. I really wanted to tell Kim. But I kept putting it off and putting it off and... uh! She is so happy. Huh. And now, here we are. What do I do? On the day she's getting married? Exactly. To a man who's cheating on her. Sh-sh-sh! Sh-sh-sh-sh! Someone could hear you. So long as Kim doesn't, you'll still get your promotion. Uh! Michael... I get that you think I'm this horrible person. That's just it. I... I know you're an amazing person. You're one of the most amazing people I have ever met. That's the problem. The problem? If you had just been a jerk this whole time and not this smart, funny, incredible woman, this wouldn't be so hard. What wouldn't be so hard? Seeing a really good person make a really bad decision. Look, I'm sorry that the... The romance gods haven't been kinder to Nicole Waters. I really am. But I started to think maybe there was a good reason for it. Wait. You think I've spent all these years having bad luck at love for a good reason? What reason would that be? So you'd still be single by the time we got a chance to meet in the park that day. I'm going to go check on the reception area. Everything here looks to be about as good as it can be. You look beautiful. Kim! You look amazing. Thank you. Nicole, this place is beautiful. You and Michael did such a great job finding it. You deserve it. Do you remember my parents, Kathleen and Marvin? Of course I do. It's nice to see you both again. So, how's the wedding area looking? They're just putting the finishing touches on it now. And the officiant? I spoke to him a few minutes ago. He should be here any moment. And what about the reception area? The tent went up last night and they're just setting up the tables and place settings. Oh! And what about... Kim, darling, this young lady has everything under control. You're right, Mom. Nicole, thank you so much for everything you've done. And she will make sure nothing bad happens to you today. Your mom's right. Today is going to be perfect. When Kim's mother and I got married, we had the service in my parent's backyard. My mother and aunts did all the decorations. My father grilled steaks for the adults and hotdogs for the kids. That sounds amazing. Mm, it wasn't much but... here we are, almost 45 years later... Still head over heels in love. Really? Yeah. Kim hasn't been that lucky yet, but let's hope she finds it with Bradley. Nicole, darling, that dress is so beautiful, and I know you helped pick it out. I had some help, actually. Marvin, is she not the most beautiful bride you have ever seen in your life? You mean the second most beautiful bride. Aww. Actually, could I have a moment with Kim? Alone? Everything's okay, right? Yes, I just have something very important that I need to tell her. Sure, dear. Come on, hon, we're going to make sure Bradley arrived. Hey. Rebecca, it's good to see you. It's been a long time. Baby Bear, let's go! Hey, Sam! Long time, no see! Hi. Oh, Sam, it's time to put away the tablet. That is a very cool dress you got there, Sam. What do you say? Thank you. You're welcome. Michael! Bradley. Honey Bunny, where's your purse? I don't know. What di-what did you say? Samantha is supposed to have a purse that matches her mom's. Oh, we look so adorable next to each other. Uh, what did you just call her? Honey Bunny. Just a nickname. Do you always call her that? There's my future in-laws. Bradley./How are you? Good. How are you guys? You holding up? Mr. and Mrs. Price, have you seen Nicole anywhere? Yeah, she's with Kim in the bride's dressing area. She said she had something to tell her and it seemed serious. Okay. Thanks. Excuse me. Is everything okay? I don't know. But this is beautiful, isn't it? I know. Must have cost a pretty penny? Yeah. Well, it's coming out of your pocket. Nicole, Nicole, wait-wait-wait! You told her? You mean did she tell me that your uncle is a jerk? That's just the thing! He's not. Michael, it's all right. I told Kim everything because you were right. I have to do the right thing, no matter what. I was wrong. How so? Michael, is, uh, everything all right? No, everything's not okay, you cheater! Cheater? Hey! Is everyone okay? Rebecca? Nicole, uh, this is Bradley's first wife, Rebecca. - Hi. - Oh, Kim! You look beautiful. Oh. Not that it matters right now, but thank you. What's going on here. Rebecca and Bradley have a daughter, Samantha. Uh-huh. Uncle Bradley, what is your nickname for Sam? My nickname for her? Please, it's important Honey Bunny. I call her Honey Bunny. Honey Bunny? Yes. - So? - Uh, yeah, so what? Oh, no. Okay, somebody better tell me what's going on right now! Kim... Kim, when I overheard Bradley talking to another woman the other night, he called her Honey Bunny. Oh. Uh, I don't understand what's going on. The other night at dinner, Nicole overheard you on the phone telling another woman that you loved her. I thought that you were cheating on Kim. - Cheating? - Cheating. But now I realize you... You were just talking to your daughter. Honey Bunny was your daughter. There is no other woman. Of course I was talking to my daughter. Pumpkin, I am head over heels in love with you and only you. I love you more than any woman that I've ever loved before. Ooh. No offence. - None taken. - Yeah. Oh! I'm just going to go. Oop! I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Oh, Bradley. I love you. And I love you, too. What do you say we go get married? I think that is the best idea I've heard all day. I can't believe you did it; you actually told her. And look at the mess I made. Really should've kept my big mouth shut, huh? Well, I don't think anybody expected you to do that. Hey, I'm proud of you. I'm sorry if I let you down, Michael. I should have told Kim earlier, even if it was a big mistake. It's okay. No, it's not. I may have a bad track record when it comes to true love, but I-I shouldn't let that change my principles. Everything turned out okay. I just want you to know that I am better than that. Nicole, over the last two weeks I think I've gotten to know the real you. The other day when we had that fight, you said something. I said something? What did I say? You sorta said... that you were... kinda falling in love with me. I did. Well, I want you to know... that I am kinda sorta... falling in love with you, too. Sorry, I didn't quite catch... I feel like you heard me. I said that I was falling in love with you. I, uh, I forgot my flowers. I'm just gonna... - Okay. - I'm sorry. Okay. Ah... I knew you two would fall for each other. Ooh... That's not what was happening. We were just talking about music for your thing, uh... - Music. - For your... Right. Ooh! Come on, let's get out there. Or we could just skip it? I mean, you've seen one wedding, you've seen 'em all, right? We spent the last two weeks working our butts off trying to pull this wedding together. But I know a place around the corner that makes the best sandwiches. I love that about you. Whoo-hoo! There you have it. Who would've thought that I, one, Nicole Waters, forever unlucky in love, would find my soulmate while planning my boss's wedding?
