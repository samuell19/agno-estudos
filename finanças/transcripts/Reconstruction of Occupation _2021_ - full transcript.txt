For many years I've been collecting family archive films. In some way I'm obsessed with them. Why? Because they're believable. I see people who really lived. I see situations as they happened. Banalities intertwine with uniqueness. A paradox that attracts me. Some time ago a friend gave me several dozen boxes of film material. This material is used exclusively by professional filmmakers. Supposedly it captured the occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1968. However, nobody has watched it before. No way! That's unbelievable! The occupation of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 was filmed by crews from Short Film Prague and Barrandov Studios. However, none of them correspond with the films that I received. I can't believe that four hours of unpublished film material exist discovered so long after August 1968. I was eleven then and have a distinct memory of the invasion of the alien army. I remember myself asking several times: A war started? Suddenly I realize that I got hold of a special kind of evidence that gives me a chance to reconstruct what happened to us fifty years ago. RECONSTRUCTION OF OCCUPATION Hello! Hi, Marek! Could you open the garage for me? Hi! Are you bringing it back? These are the boxes you gave me the last time I was here. This is how it was two months ago. Tell me, how did they get here? How did they get here? I've had them for at least ten years. -And where were they before? -Over there on a shelf. I mean even before that. Where did they come from? I got it from a friend who didn't know what to do with it. He did not know what was on it but he thought it was from 1968. -And where did he get it from? -I don't know. I have no idea. -Let me show you the whole thing. -It's good! Who... -Who shot it, right? This is the bus. Wait, what bus? You were there? Yup. -Could you be there somewhere? -Yes. That's quite possible. The director and documentary film-maker Jan Šikl got hold of many hours of unique and unpublished footage from August 1968. It's absurd that after fifty years, 35 film boxes suddenly surface, treasures from my point of view that had been hidden and nobody tried to make any use of it. The aim is to find those among you who can identify themselves, their fathers, grandmothers in so far unpublished shots. Hello? Yes, I sent you an e-mail yesterday. I was an eight-year-old boy then. There was a classic steel arch bridge there. And there was a road sign "5T" in front of the bridge. They probably thought it meant "five tanks", so two or three tanks drove on the bridge and it collapsed. They were shooting from Palacký Bridge and from Charles Square. They started shooting and the others joined! I put a pillow over my ears so I wouldn't hear it. There were nurses already there who pushed our beds into the hall. There were no windows there and later they took us down to a small room where we spent about a week. Hello? You will see a young woman with short dark hair, staring. Wait, could you tell me which one is you? -Yes, I could. -So wait... -Black hair? -Yes, short black hair. I can see you now. I like how young I was. I was there when they arrived with tanks and troop carries and when they encircled the radio station. I put my baby into a stroller and I went there. I was there every day until they left. I even dreamed about it. I felt sick about what happened in the country. FOR PRESIDENT SVOBODA, FOR PARTY SECRETARY DUBČEK It's the morning of the 21st. It's in Karlovy Vary. What else would you like to know? I might have been shouting "Dubček" or something like that. I was 23, I guess... Mr Mucha, I have a suggestion. Could we meet in person? Yes, this is us! This is me and Jirka Hanák and I think I'm shouting "Dubček". There was some hope that the borders would open. INVADERS All of sudden, troops appear in the streets. It's a terrible shock, you can't capture it. Not even describe it. GO HOME ! It's despair combined with hope, which is contained in the word Dubček. Only today do I realize what was going on? Maybe it was Party politics. I don't understand it at all and it's the reason why I don't like political parties in general. DEAR TO US YESTERDAY, MURDERERS TODAY This is me! You see, just a few meters and it could have been my name up there. It is terrible. Suddenly, you're on the ground crawling and you wonder if you'll get hit or not. At that point I did not know there had been people killed. Throughout my life, I have felt humiliation and horror from the shooting I experienced there. But humiliation for the most part. The fact that somebody comes here and occupies us. ATTENTION STATE BORDER Did they say "big"? I can't understand... Or I don't want to understand. We just know the Soviet Union are friends so we don't understand why they attacked us. So we called and asked but we didn't get an answer. And one just can't understand the meaning of the situation. I can't believe such an attack was even possible. RECONSTRUCTION OF OCCUPATION I remember a Russian tank approaching us from that street. Honestly, it didn't feel so good having a tank gun right in front of your face. We were defending the radio station. The Pilsen Radio was the only one still broadcasting in the country. This is my mom. And this is me. Applause! Oh no! -There were lots of people here... -Why did they come here? To support the radio! So the Russkies wouldn't destroy it, so that broadcasting wouldn't stop as it had in the whole country. Pilsen Radio was the last one still broadcasting. LONG LIVE PILSNER RADIO! "Rather than give Russians eggs, I hung myself by my legs." I must say I never felt like filming when I woke up in the morning. I felt sick. I can't stand such things. I went there because I felt it was my duty. Recently I was joking that I was glad when Russians took over everything and I didn't have to go out to film. -What made you feel disgusted? -Well, I was simply scared! There were bullets flying by at Wenceslas Square. It wasn't fun! Wait, wait! These look like my shots. They're all lost. But I didn't take this it is from the opposite side. Hello. Peter Kalmus speaking. I've had some stuff from family archives boxed up for many years. 16 mm film, high quality. Let me know if you're interested. It's good... I wish the film had not been made! The occupation hadn't happened! The communism never existed! But… My late father-in-law remembered he had the film somewhere at his cottage. It was buried in the ground, packed and sealed in a metal container. This is it. Thousands of citizens of the town of Košice with stones and bare hands... Unarmed, not even an air gun. There was a hotel being built there, they took bricks and threw them. They simply tried, tried to stop them by emotions, which wasn't possible. You can't stop thousands of cars with bare hands or a brick. FREEDOM FOR CZECHOSLOVAKIA ! OUR FREEDOM IS CALLED DUBČEK Halt! Turn! AS LONG AS WE ARE HERE, WE'LL HOLD OUR COUNTRY DEAR ! GO HOME ! GO HOME ! The first takes are from Hradec Králové airport, judging by the numbers on the MiG planes. There were only two regiments with MiGs-15 at that time. You were the airport commander? I was his deputy. At 1:30 AM I got a phone call from the airport supervisor, he told me we were being occupied. He sent a car for me, I came out of my house and I could see and hear a stream of planes humming, and nothing was happening! Nobody would tell us anything! They were all coming from the east. We had seven fighter regiments in this direction! Seven! And above us planes flew carrying tanks, armored troop carriers, soldiers... We never got any order! A soldier doesn't ask if he is going to die or not. A soldier doesn't ask if he is going to win or lose. At 3:30 PM we got the first orders from the Ministry of Defense and from the President. The two orders contradicted each other. According to one, we were supposed to provide all necessary help to the occupying soldiers, the other one said we should provide nothing. Then, some Polish paratroopers dropped. And they treated us like... I felt like our people felt during the occupation in 1939. Yes, I see you. Come here. This street. This is Miško's blood. This is the door to the shop, it shut down afterwards. They would run for the door. And when he turned back, he got shot. "A student of our school, M. Hamrák, died tragically on August 21, 1968" The army hospital is quite far away from our flat. We got there after 8 PM, it was already curfew. By the last 500 meters to the Hospital, we were already crawling. We got there, my mom got up, banged on the door and said: "I am looking for my son." Then the gate opened... I can still recall their exact words although I was a ten-year old girl. "Who are you looking for?" "We are looking for Miško Hamrák. We thought he might be here, wounded." "He is here. He is dead." It was too much even for me as a ten-year old kid. My mom collapsed. Was lying on the ground. I lay down on top of her... That's all I know. On August 21, my mom took my hand at 10 PM and held my hand for a week. She kept holding my hand. Always. -Hello, are you Mr Šikl? -Yes, I am. -You are Mr Kraus, right? -Yes, I am. I don't have a device for watching this. I also have Palach's funeral. I used to work here in the Research Institute of Food Industry. Can you see the arches? From the first floor there, I was filming And one of the approaching tank shot at me as it came closer. Where in Prague did you film? -At an ice-skating rink and places... -I mean in 1968. Oh, in 1968... At Vinohradská Street. They were just coming! I wanted to document it because I could not believe my eyes. That it was even possible. That it was possible after the war... In peaceful times... To shoot at the people. To shoot at the radio building. My eyes were filled with tears because they were doing unbelievable things. A tank hit a bus. They broke a baker's van and the buns were scattered around the street. My mind rose against it, it was beyond me. They jumped down and started to shoot around... He got pissed off, took an axe and started trashing the tanks. He got my respect. We were all eighteen or nineteen then and we agreed to leave... the country. Is it true? She emigrated to Australia. I left for Germany. Vrba was in Sweden. Svozil is in Norway. Twenty people. All our acquaintances. They either went to prison or... What happened in 1945? In 1945 my dad did not come back from the war. The Germans interned him. I have been a half-orphan since. In 1960 I got married. 1968: a turning point in my life. I got interested in politics and was disappointed at the same time. Our society... ...when I returned from the army in 1960, the new Constitution was written. They released many prisoners. Even the hockey players who were imprisoned then. In 1968, my children were seven and eight so I took them to Prague Castle when President Novotný was dismissed and as a family, we all went to the election of Ludvík Svoboda. I took an active part and showed my children the direction the country might take. There was some hope that it would be different. There were many of us who could still remember the First Republic. We were sons of small sole traders or sons of various company owners. There were workers who remembered what it was like earlier. -And what did you expect? -That it would come back. It was not that long after 1945. Why should you look at such a terrible humiliation? You can see they destroyed everything. This is the so-called "revival process". It was the best effort this nation had made since the National Revival in the 19th century. People did not realize what a great moment it was. Everyone treated each other with great courtesy. Anti-communists and communists, except for the villains from the 50s, tolerated each other and discussed things. It was an incredible moment, the eight months from January until the Occupation. I have never again experienced anything like that. 1989 cannot be compared to it. It was just a starting point for accumulating wealth. There was no meaning. We used to have a hippie band. And once, the guys played completely naked. All naked, painted. Like The Primitives Group. Listen, what happened on May 1, 1968... there is a monument to the fallen soldiers in the square. There was a May Day Parade, we got out the sound system. There was rock music playing at the parade and we put out a box for money and people threw money into it. In 1968! Hello? Hello? -Hello? -Hello? Can I help you? When Svoboda was elected president, there was a scaffolding on the Archbishop Palace, I was standing up there, and I could see into the courtyard as Svoboda was passing the guards of honor. It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining. His head was lit by the sun, he looked like God. I was so impressed that I signed the congratulations at the reception. I regretted it for long. Especially after his role in August 1968. After what he did in Moscow. At that time, the nation was very sentimental towards Dubček. They raised hopes... False hopes! Actually, they were driven by the rise of the nation. WE DON'T WANT AN OCCUPATION AWAY WITH TRAITORS ! OCCUPANTS GO HOME ! RUSSIANS GO HOME ! -Mr Zapletal? -Yes, it's me. I am Jan Šikl. Thanks for picking me up. Come in. Look, it was meaningless, because it's... No, it's not hidden. It's here. Shot through the shoulder. This is where the bullet entered. A bullet from a machine gun. The hole on the other side is bigger. There is a tank in front of the Communist Party Central Committee. It's literally below the windows of Alexander Dubček's office. I jumped on a troop carrier and as I rode on it, I felt some: Bump - Bump! These bumps were a woman's thighs. She did not manage to get away and the troops carrier rode over her legs. When the crowd saw the woman, the people went wild. Somebody screamed: "Get them!", and the crowd attacked the soldiers. Then something stopped me. I realized I was shot and I flung myself behind a street lamp. They were not firing at the people, of course, otherwise there would have been dozens of people dead. They fired above people's heads with the expected effect. Everyone lay down on the ground and the attack on the Soviet troops was stopped. I screened it... but... Who am I supposed to play it for? Myself? Nobody cares. The first thing I did was grab a bag and run out to Strossmayer Square to go shopping. There were people already in line who had the same idea. The atmosphere was great. People were helping each other. If somebody didn't have money, others would lend them some. So I did my shopping. Incredibly positive relationships were revealed there in the line. This is where the bullet penetrated. Another penetration, you should be able to see it now. We found out at noon. They arrived in the morning and my brother was wounded at noon. We hated the Russkies! We blamed it all on them of course! What do you mean "changed?" A young guy was shot to death less than a meter away from me. He was holding a flag, maybe that's why they focused on him. And as he was falling down, without a single sound, the flag fell on him. That's why it was covered in blood. Fifty years! That can't be true... It's a shock, you know. All your life you are told: "Forever with the Soviet Union. They are our friends." And suddenly you realize a friend is standing against you with a machine gun. It was like a spectacle. It was fun in some way watching people attack the Soviet soldiers verbally. It was amazing. The soldiers could not believe their eyes. I liked the fact that the resistance was so intellectual. I got a good impression of the Czech nation. Why do you talk to them at all? Look at their stupid faces. They have no idea who they are and where they are. Why they are here. What language we speak here. I stopped at Wenceslas Square. Trucks held young boys waving flags as if we'd won a hockey championship. I didn't like that. Then I met a group of people who found out that if you take a manhole cover and cram it under the tracks of a tank, the tracks would come off and those tanks would go in circles. There were a few guys who came with Molotov cocktails and they threw them from the front at the tank, which is wrong. It was supposed to hit the engine. Later, we threw a Molotov cocktail at a truck with a tilt because it burned much faster than a tank. We could remember what we were told in the army, how to destroy things. I did my military service in a troop where we were trained to be thorough. How to set something on fire and destroy things. I never used it, only here once - and it worked! This is Vinohrady Hospital. I had been there since 10 AM already. Oh, that's me over there! I was radical then and might have advocated for the Hungarian way. To fight as long as you can. SHIT ! I think that the resistance would be good in the future. And then a guy came and said: "What are you doing, guys? They came to help us!" I got really upset. You believe you are doing something right and then he tells you: "What are you doing? They came to help us!" USSR - GO BACK HOME MURDERERS ! ATTENTION ! GO HOME ! This is Kateřina Kovářová, Czech Television. An unknown person left a box with a film at the reception desk. He didn't leave his name, any contact. I have no idea what it is. WE WERE AND WE WILL BE ! When they took our politicians and our president to Moscow we went into the streets and protested but that's it, that was all we could do. They did not react to it at all. I'd say they ignored us. Brezhnev even said: "What is it - ten million people?" YOU HAVE TANKS WE HAVE THE TRUTH ! FOR DUBČEK, FOR SVOBODA, FOR ČERNÍK AWAY WITH THE TRAITORS AND COLLABORATORS ! "I protest! I am on a hunger strike from 21.8. till 25.8. Join me!" "Our motto: We won't eat, will drink only water, until they return us Svoboda and Dubček!" This is me. I was a head guard, a sergeant. When the Russians got here, I said: "Guys, don't do anything stupid." "No shooting, no heroism is worth it." We told them to leave. But they did not ask. They broke the lock and started to disarm us. Some were reluctant so I said: "Give it to them." Because I knew our brothers came to defend us. That's what we were able to get out of it... Then the commander of the tank battalion called me and said it was a smart decision. I got this watch as a reward and a week off. Because I stayed calm, I reacted reasonably and there was no military incident. "WE ASK FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF OCCUPATION TROOPS". "JOIN IN, YOUR FUTURE IS ALSO AT STAKE". I wanted to fight and was foolish enough to go to the army department and I asked the major: "The Russians are here. Where should I go?" He said: "What do you mean?" I said: "Mobilization." He said: "There will be no mobilization!" And when he said that, I asked myself: "Why did we do military service?" "SVOBODA + ČERNÍK + DUBČEK = THE ONLY LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT" "FREEDOM FOR THE NATION. AWAY WITH TRAITORS AND COLLABORATORS" The people in the streets were brave. And our leaders in Moscow had the information that the nation was resisting. But the nation's morale has to be supported by the personalities who lead. And they won't betray! They must show they are the ones, that they are serious, ready to sacrifice "their lives and fortunes." As the noblemen say. THE YOUTH WELCOME YOU, DEAR COMRADES OUR PROTECTORS I can't really imagine what else we could have done if we didn't want bloodshed. I wouldn't be against bloodshed though. But today people would say: "Dubček, you knew how it would end. Why have you done it? You didn't have to do it!" What kind of change can you, an average Joe, make? I don't read any newspaper today, I buy nothing because... I know that all elections are always manipulated and it's kind of a mockery of the whole society that is willing to accept and comes to terms with everything. What struck me at Wenceslas Square were groups of people, ten, twenty people chanting "We won't live on our knees" and "Freedom, freedom," and so on. And nobody joined them! The celebration of the October Revolution followed right after and Soviet and Czechoslovak flags were put up in our school, and my boys burnt the Soviet one and left the Czechoslovak flag untouched. I knew who did it. There was an investigation, criminal police. Our people investigated it. Who, why, how... The two guys who did it would have been expelled for good. And how did it end? It was hushed up. Only I and they knew it. The principal also tried to force me to say who did it. I said: "I don't know." Ten months and then he died anyway... Mom took his white shirt and stuck it out of the window the way people did it with flags. It was stained with blood. I remember the municipal council called her and told her to remove it. She wanted to express it somehow. What else could she do? How could we fight back? We were ordinary people. And the people surrendered. Look at today's situation after all. They also surrendered. In 1968, six or ten days, and then it was quiet! They were building socialism again - pubs were packed... People grumbled but went to the obligatory May Day Parade anyway. LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC OF SVOBODA AND MASARYK ! YOU PUT OBSTACLES IN OUR WAY UNTIL WE THROW ONE AT YOU ! I surrendered as well. Come. Here. THE COMMUNISTS ARE BASTARDS. BIG ONES. This is my political testament that I wrote here... during the 1968 occupation. PEOPLE, BE ALERT, A MAN DIED. JAN PALACH (11.8.1948 - 19.1.1969) Do you remember when Jan Palach burnt himself to death? Yes, I do. But I won't talk about it. I'm sorry. Could you at least explain why you won't talk about it? Because I don't get him. I don't get this act. What I don't get? I don't get that Oriental way of suicide. I won't say anything else. I just don't get it! I read a newspaper and I went to Prague. I was at his funeral. He made a good protest. But his death was a loss. I think that somebody should have talked him out of it. On the other hand, it is true that if a nation does not have symbols, it has nothing to refer to and is missing something. And what they're missing is national pride. I took my students to Palach's funeral and got fired. My wife was also fired from school because of Palach. I know that there are monuments and bridges named after him abroad. So what? I think he didn't help anyway. The bigwigs do whatever they want. RENOUNCING FREEDOM MEANS RENOUNCING HUMANITY. Palach's act didn't wake up the society, just the opposite, it brought it to its knees. The nation completely lost hope. People gave up! August 1969 CONFIDENTIAL ! A year later, it was obvious that it was over. Why? Because our own people started to beat us. What happened to you? I mean, they did not beat me. They beat the nation! The anniversary of August 21, 1969. Wenceslas Square. Those were our people who intervened against the protestors. And during the next demonstration, a policeman put me in a police van. A young guy in the car said: "What are you doing here, teacher?" He was a policeman in plain clothes. And he let me out. They brought soldiers from Kutná Hora, A guy next to me said: "There's my son in that cordon of soldiers." If it came to a clash, a son would beat up his father. The old duffers from People's militia, that was the end! That was the moment I realized it was hopeless. I don't know... Why did we lose it so soon? I think we got it with very little effort. So we soon lost it again. Did you join the Communist Party after 1968? I had to. There was no other way. A manager in a uranium mine couldn't be a non-party man. Did you know that what you mined would go to Russia? Of course, we all knew that. The Russians guarded it all here. They had their representatives here. Their minister of energy would come here every year. Later I got promoted and would even meet him. Or if he was here, I was in the group who welcomed him, dealt and drank with him. How did it feel? Not very good. But it wasn't possible to spit in his face. It didn't agree with my conscience but it was necessary because I had to support my family. I had two children and the family needed it. For example, a Russian officer from the Prostějov airport needed a truck. They asked me: "Can you do it?" I said: "Yes, if you pay!" ...I didn't care. We came to the station in Olomouc, a train arrived with comrades. The Russian footmen were waiting there. They brought five to eight TVs per person and I delivered them. I didn't care. I am being honest. I said: "I want one TV, OK ?" Did it make you sad sometimes? You simply submitted, you know. It didn't work out when I was young, then I had a family... It was a change in my life. I was against the occupation, I made the film, I signed petitions. I used to be an engineer, but was demoted to a laborer. I was a subway mechanic for the next twenty years. I knew I insisted on this so I told myself I'd just be doing something else. -Did you regret it? -No. -Did you regret it later? -No. It's a pity. They take your entire life. Did you feel like they took your life? I couldn't make films for twenty-five years of my life. That's quite long. But then, I got twenty-five more years when I could. Look, you have to imagine that my father lost his hotel. And he was told that if he joined the Communist Party, he could become the manager of the hotel. And my dad said NO ! Because some of our friends were already in prison. So a decent person can't accept this. This is how I see my whole life: I can't do worse things than my dad. I was hoping that more people would behave this way! For me, it was obvious that I didn't want to live in this country. I was in Prague for two more days and I left on August 24. StB The Slovak State Security. In plain clothes. They searched our house for flyers, checked if we were doing any anti-socialist propaganda. Our family was affected forever. It's 8 AM, you're asleep and somebody kicks in your door. Four cops. They turn your flat into a mess, then slam the door and are gone. After lunch, you want to go to a cemetery to light a candle, and there are two cops at the gate, they won't let you see the grave. What they did to mom... They killed her. She was in a psychiatric hospital for seven days, getting electric shocks. This is how they cured her depression. And when I first saw her after, it was not a woman, it was an animal. She was in a psych ward more than at home for the first two years and attempted suicide twenty or thirty times. Every time we managed to save her - except the last time. This is my mom. And this is me as a child. Time might dull the pain but as you get older, you may suffer even more because you understand it. You understand what actually happened, how your life was destroyed... The discovered 35 mm film footage was shot by several anonymous cameramen of the former Army Film. To this day, most of it is thought to be lost.
