But I want to know the secret which you've kept hidden from me. I didn't tell you for I wanted to see you happy. I wanted to bring you up like a normal child. I didn't want to burden you with all these things. I'm no more a child. I should know what my Indian mother's fault is. All right. I'll tell you everything. Then you can decide. I met your mother when I was an ambassador for India. She was a journalist. She lived in Malaga. We celebrated our honeymoon in Malaga. Then, she came to Vienna with me. But suddenly one day she said she wanted to return to Malaga. She left a year old baby and me. I... I called her up. I had even written to her. But she never agreed to return. I may be a culprit. But a small child, what was her fault? Why did she punish you? I don't know. I've brought you up since you were a child. If I've no right over you then it's alright. But I want to tell you something. When your mother left me you were my hope to live. And now if you leave me I'll have no reason to live. I want to marry Sonia. How dare you? You... You Indian. Sir your daughter loves this Indian. I thought you were a decent man, so I called you here. But you... My decency has been degraded only... because I want to marry your daughter. No, no way that my daughter will ever marry you. Yes! She will never marry you. If you don't mind, I'll like to hear it from Sonia. Caroline, send Sonia in. I love you Prem but... but my father... he needs me. My mom had left him. She never returned. He has no one except me. Why didn't you think of it earlier? What right do you have to break my heart? Give me a reply. Why did you come into my life? I was living well. Why did you come into my life? Why? Are you listening to me? Do you hear me? Tony! I said, I will not have food. Tony! Hi! Ah! Ma'am, I thought you must have already left. I was about to leave but someone stopped me. - I know who stopped you. - Who? Your inner conscience stopped you. It told you, Stop! Don't go... whatever you'll find here, you won't find anywhere. Right? Yes. Only once you can love someone truly. So, don't lose it. Yes, Madam. You are right! Congratulations, Tony! Congratulations! Madam is not leaving you and going anywhere. God has answered your prayers. Tony, this article... I don't know. You see, even my photo is printed in renowned newspaper. - Prem... - He is Prem Arya, my close pal. Where does he live? He doesn't live here. But he keeps on coming here. But Madam, you must meet him once. He is a wonderful man! He writes excellent articles. Tell him about your life... Can you introduce me to him? Why not? Think your job is done. - Prem brother! - Hey Tony! - Brother Prem! - How are you? - Today I want to talk to you openly! - Tony, what are you doing? What are you doing? Give me your hand. - Which one? - Your right hand. What a fortune! A man like Tony will take birth and die unnoticed. But the day I saw this hand, my luck has changed. Whoever reads this article... they go crazy! I wrote this article 8 months back. And you've already thanked me 16 times. What's so important? It's a special day today. Madam had come to my house today. Who? Madam! She's a beauty. You won't find such a beauty anywhere. She came to my house and read your article. I had hung your article on the wall. She liked the article. I told her I'll introduce her to the person who wrote it. No big deal! What's her name? Strange! I didn't ask her name. No problem. What's in a name? A rose will always remain rose, even if you change its name. Good! You are praising her so much. It means you are in love. Isn't it? I'm not of her standard. She is very rich I can admire her but not possess her. Very well said. Very well said. Come to the restaurant. She was praising you so much that I told her I'll introduce you to her. Please meet her. I'll be honoured. - For my sake. - Okay, okay. Today at 4.30 p.m. Hey Tony, one minute. Speak up Ma'am. Good things shouldn't be kept to heart. Or else, it's not good. Here... - What's this? - Keep it. No, I won't accept fees from you. One earns for living, but sometimes I do listen to my heart. But this is not the fees. Then, what is it? You pay the hotel bill. - Come on. - Okay, cool. I got it. A lady should not pay when accompanied by a man. Right? - Okay, let's move. - Let's go. - Hey Tony! - Hi, Prem! Hi! - Happening, man! - You are happening. Mr. Prem, stunned aren't you? You wouldn't have expected to meet such a person. My Madam is beautiful, isn't she? Madam, this is Mr. Prem and Mr. Prem this is Madam. - Hi Prem. - How are you Sonia? Alive. How do you know her? A journallst coming from Vienna had told me. Excuse me, I'll place the order. His suit is giving me a complex. How did you land here? Perhaps to meet you. You have come alone. Nanny is with me. Papa's not here. I've not married as yet. I didn't ask you that. You were watching my hands. I thought, you were looking... out for the wedding ring. How are you? Fine and happy too. Are you angry? Not at all. We couldn't get married, but at least we can be friends. We were and will remain friends. You know my helplessness. I have not changed. I still love you. Now this is of no use. Prem please try to understand. Please. I've placed the order. Where's Mr. Prem? He has left. We will also leave. Leave? Hey Joe! Forget it. Wonder what happened? The meeting got over in one minute. Madam forgot her money with me. God always gives me a chance to come across her. What is the matter? - You went to meet Prem? - Yes. - You shouldn't have gone. - Nanny. I realized it after meeting him that I love him very much. I can't live without him. Never! Forget him. How? I can't forget him. You deserve a better guy than him. What is she talking? Marry someone of your status. Status! He's poor, that's his crime? I love him. He gave me the happiness which even my father couldn't give me. - Whatever it is, I love him. - I too love you a lot. Think about it, Sonia. I heard it, it's okay. But what if anyone else would've heard it? There would be a problem. Now nothing can stop me. I'll love him till my last breath. And I'll only love you! If you say, I'll kiss you... in this lovely weather. If you say, I'll kiss you... in this lovely weather. The heart says... my beloved... I should cross all limits in love. If you say, I'll go round... in your passion. If you say, I'll go round in your passion. The heart says... my beloved, I should cross all limits in love. If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather. If you say, I'll go round in your passion. From your tresses, I'll steal your fragrance. I'll steal the loveliness from your lips. - Stop it, I am feeling shy. - Why do you feel shy? Why do you fear? Nothing is in our control. If you say, I'll go round in your passion. If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather. My eyes keep watching you all the time. These fair arms just wish for you. I cannot live being separated from you. In these eyes... I have dreams... and I am waiting for you. If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather. If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather. The heart says... my beloved, I should cross all limits in love. If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather. If you say, I'll go round in your passion. - Hello. - Hi Prem! Sonia! How did you get this number? From Tony. Good you called me up. I was thinking about you the whole night. I was sorry for yesterday's behaviour. I should not have said that. Whatever you said was right. I've no right to step into your life again. My life? My life doesn't remain mine anymore. I never imagined, our attempt in order to make Papa happy... would drift us far apart. Prem. I'm leaving tomorrow. Don't go, Sonia. - Prem, I... - Please. But till now... Until it's possible, please. - Ok. I love you Sonia... - Me too Prem. - So we will have to unpack? - Yes. If you get the time then think about it that if your father comes to know... What he will think. This is the limit, Madam! You went without informing me. I'm waiting for you since morning. I wasted 8 liters petrol for you. I was about to go to the police station. You should've left a message at the desk. I was so worried, you know. I'm sorry. Now don't embarrass me. I've no right to talk to you like this. You are so beautiful. You can even turn a gentleman into a rogue. I'll do everything with your permission in future. Okay? Tomorrow I've to go to Paradise island. Prem has called me. You can go. - Won't you come? - If you wish, I'll come. All right, tomorrow we'll go. Come, I'll drop you. You don't like my like? Good I found you. I've bought a dress. How do I look? - How much did it cost? - Nine hundred rupees. Why? It's too much. Seems to be new. No jokes. Tony, tell me, how do I look? - I told you, the dress seems to be new. - It's new. Listen... I'll wear this for the party in Paradise island. We'll go together. - I can't go with you there. - Why? Because I'll have to take my tourist around. Work, you see, baby. Tourists? Or that Madam. She is also one of my tourist. Look Neena, Madam is my work and my work is my worship. - Hi Tony. - Hi buddy how are you? - Hey! How are you? - Hi - Hi. - Hello. - It's okay, see you bye. How are you Mr. Gonzalves? - How are you doing? - I am fine. - He is a big shot. Big shot. Hi Rodriquez. He is the commissioner. See... This is Prem. What are you doing here? - Tony boy, how are you? - How are you doing? You are looking handsome. Very handsome. What are you doing here? Tony, mind your language or else you'll repent. - You are the worst person here. - Move on! - Take it easy. Relax. - What man, this is very bad. - Neena, this is Sonia. Neena. - Hi Neena. - Hello. - You always insult me during parties. Let's dance, please. Silly girl! Who the hell will dance with you? Who will get insulted in the party? You always raise your hands at the wrong place! Tony please do it. You! Oh you! I can dance at your finger tips. I will come in one minute. As it is I've to dance at your finger tips for the whole life. Haiya Ho! Haiya Ho! Haiya Ho! Haiya Ho! Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic! Me and you! What fun! What magic! Such meetings don't happen everyday, my love. Let's talk about our love with our eyes. Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic! Me and you! What fun! What magic! Such meetings don't happen everyday, my love. Let's talk about our love with our eyes. Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic! What magic! Your eyes are amazing! Your blue eyes are beautiful! A face like yours is not to be seen here. Such beautiful hair is not to be seen here. You are fanatical! Alone! There is no one like anywhere. Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic! Me and you! What fun! What magic! Such meetings don't happen everyday, my love. Let's talk about our love with our eyes. Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic! What magic! What is my story! Listen! I am heart broken! Listen! Whom should I tell this thing to? Whom should I show my pain to? These wounds those moments, we will never think of them again. Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic! Me and you! What fun! What magic! Such meetings don't happen everyday, my love. Let's talk about our love with our eyes. Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic! What magic! Hey! Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! Ho! I am crazy about you, my beloved. You are my story, my beloved. I have always thought about you, I swear. I have always loved you, I swear. In my heart, there is aspiration only for you. There is no one like you anywhere. Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic! Me and you! What fun! What magic! Such meetings don't happen everyday, my love. Let's talk about our love with our eyes. - Haiya Ho! - What fun! What magic! What magic! - Me and you! - What fun! What magic! What are you doing? What are you doing? Listen. How wonderful you look! I'm serious. I'll write an article on Neena. Sonia, you know... she's an amazing girl. She is self reliant at such a small age. She manages all alone. - Isn't it wonderful? - As it is she's crazy. God knows what'll happen after her article is published. - Tony! - Here she starts! - Here we go again. Start. Those who don't have anyone's support have to be self-reliant. Don't you have anyone? Parents, brothers, sisters? Tony is my neighbour and my friend too. And... and... He's my only childhood friend. He's my support. What else could I do, Madam? I too am an orphan like her. So I can understand her grief. I had seen a play when I was a kid. It's dialogues touched my heart. Loneliness supports loneliness. We kept on supporting each other and have come a else way. Now let's see where destiny takes us. I am very impressed, seriously. But nowadays I'm tensed. Why? She is young and above all she is beautiful. I'm thinking of getting her married off. Did you see brother Prem? Did you see? I can understand the whole world but not her. Just a minute, I'll be back. Hey you basket of flower! Hey my beauty! My fenny! Did you notice something? Yes, I did. The girl loves him and the guy does not understand. Why does it happen? Why is there a problem in every love story? Perhaps God is testing us. Whether the love is true or not. What about those who pass the test? They unite. - But Madam... - We enjoyed, didn't we? - Of course Ma'am. - Thank you Tony. I feel proud of myself today. No doubt, I am a guide. I never got to see so much till today. I'm sorry. I'll leave. - What is it? - I want to say something. Go on. Now what will she say in this closed room?! Sit. My chair will get wet! No problem, I'll sit. Have you ever been in love? My friends have been. But now it seems, it's my turn. I know. Do you know, how one feels when in love? Yes, I know, I'm getting it... How will you come to know that a girl is in love? I'll come to know. Then, go ahead, find out. A girl... in love. I'll keep it as a secret. But tell the girl at least. What? I love you. - Shall I? - Yes - Sure! Shall I tell her? - Go on... - I'm feeling shy. It's very simple, Tony. I love you. The thing is I have never said it to anyone. I will say it. I... love... you. Yes! Yes, Tony! That's it! You've said it. - Madam? - Yes. Shall I leave? Good night, Tony. Goodnight. Goodnight. - Bye, bye. - Goodnight. If you say, I'll kiss you in this lovely weather. If you say... I'll kiss you in this lovely weather. The heart says... my beloved... I should cross all limits in love. A glass for him, this is mine. - Hey! Neena! - Tony! You are enjoying all alone. There is a candle, and a castle. For whom is the other glass? For the one whom I love! Who is that unfortunate guy? Hey, mind you! Don't you bad-mouth him. - Are you serious? - Of course, yes. - You love him very much? - Yes, a lot. Did you tell him, I love you You should express your love from the very start. Whenever you propose someone for the first time in life... you know you feel as if you've consumed a bottle of sweet wine... which also gives you a high. Yes, it does happen in love. I just can't believe! The way she said, I love you - She? - Who? Madam, who else? I was thinking that only I loved her. But today I realised that she also loves me. Yes Tony, this fire is such that it burns everything. Some express it whereas some are just helpless. You are quite intelligent! Come on cheers! Cheers to Sonia! Hey! Have it! Why don't you have it? Actually my companion is drifting away from me. Is he? No problem. He'll be on the track again. If your love is true, may be after some time but he will be yours. Come on cheers! Cheers for Sonia! Come on. Come on, cheers for your love, man! Have it. Hello. Sonia, what are you doing? I'm thinking, what I should do. Shall I help you? Please. Spend your day with someone who spends sleepless nights... thinking about you. Good idea! But where do I find such a person. I know him. Really? What's his name? Prem. Wait for me on the beach. I'll be coming. Bye. Yahoo, Sonia! Papa, you! Yes, my baby! Are you not happy to see me? No papa. I am very happy. But all of a sudden... What a pleasant surprise! My darling girl! I was missing you. So I came here. That's why I am here. How do you like Malaga? How do you like India? Nice! The weather, the people... just wonderfully warm. Now I'm here for your company. You will not be alone. We will do everything together. I will give her a flower. I'll give madam a flower. In exchange of that she will give me a kiss. And in exchange of that I will give her a kiss. I think she is having a bath. - Yes. - Yes. - What can I do for you? One masala tea, and 4 biscuits please. No! No! - Who are you and why you are here? - Why you are here? - Who are you? - I am me. What the hell are you doing here? Hell means hell? He says he will hit me. Who let you in here? Have you gone crazy? - What? - Hey you fool! This is too much! - What is this? - Hey you are going on talking because I am listening. Idiot! Get out of here! - Quiet! Quiet! - What are you saying? - Hey you... - No! I understand nothing. Are you mad? You get out of here. I'll call the security guards now. No one dare call Tony idiot here in Goa. You idiot! I don't care. You get out of here or I will call the security guards. Security guard! I'll give him a tenner and he'll disappear. So you don't know, who am I. - Who are you? - I'm Ambassador of Austria. I'm the Mercedes of India. - Mercedes of India. - Yes. - You idiot. You get out of here. You stupid, idiot. I'm not abusing you for you are elder to me. You are exceeding your limits. Then, what is this? Don't you know, this is a piece of cucumber. - Then what you want? - What you want? - I want you to get out of here? - I want you to get out from there. - Where? - You go out from khidki What is a khidki? Khidki means window. Stupid man! Because you are elder you keep saying all this? - Yes, so what? - Now I'll catch you. - What will you do? - Surely, I'll catch you. - Yes. - And after that? - I'll catch your nose. - Don't touch me! - Why? No body can touch Tony Gonsalves. He is too much man. - I can also touch you. - So, what's great? What is that? I want you to get out now. - Even I want you to get out now. - Where? - Out. - This is my place. - This is my place. - What are you going to do? - So what are you going to do? I am going to touch you. Touch you, like this. Even I can touch you. Touch you. You are an Indian! You are not only an idiot but a swine. - I am not a swine. - I want you to be out of here. - Tony... - Yes. I want you out of here. It's between two men. Ladies should not interfere. Go and have a bath in the bathroom. - But Tony. - No. - Tony. - Papa. - Papa. Papa! - Papa, Tony. - Yes. Papa. Sonia's papa. - Papa. - Papa. - Tony. - Tony. - Tony guide. - Tony guide. - He escorts me in Goa. - Escorts in Goa. - He is always so happy. - I am always so happy. - He is a gentleman. - I am a gentleman, papa. - Papa. Forgive me. - Security! Get him out from here. Papa, he is apologizing. - Forgive me, papa. - He is sorry. - You are mad. - Sorry. But he is very sweet you know. Papa, I am your Tony! - Sonia, get him out of here. - Papa, I love you. Please papa, I'll handle him. - Security! - I'll handle him. - No! I don't like him. Papa, don't worry, I'll ask him to leave. - Tony! - Idiot! Get out! - Papa! Papa! - Papa! Get the hell out of here! - Ya... - May I speak to Sonia please? - Who is calling? - Prem. - Prem. So that's why you are here in India. I see... Prem No, I didn't come to India to meet Prem. I was here to see my mother's grave. I didn't even know that Prem was here. I suddenly met him. Sure I understand. A girl sets off from Vienna to go to Singapore... she gets down at Bombay. Then, she goes to Malaga. Where the population is around 3 lakhs and out of all these people... she meets the only one person whom sheshould not meet. You want me to believe this story. You can ask nanny. This is true. No, my dear. Truth is, you told a lie to your father. You came here to meet Prem. You didn't expect, I would come here. And you were caught red-handed. Papa, please believe me. You know, I never lie. You can lie... for an Indian blood flows through your veins. Your mother too was a liar, so what if you lie. - Papa. - Do not shout. You did what you wished. Get ready. We are going back to Vienna. - Prem... - Sonia... - That. Sonia, no need to utter a word. There is no need to explain anything. I know this is not my story... whose end I can write myself. For someone else has written my fate. And there are only two pages of this story. The first and the last. - Some stories are short. - I can't explain... I told you, there's no need to explain. I know the end of my story. I am sorry, Prem. When are you going? Day after tomorrow. You can't but the time can stand still. Why are you getting so emotional? You are a guide. People will enter your life and will leave. People come and go in this city. But not in the life of Tony guide. I understand. I can understand your feelings. But I cannot stay here. And for how else? One day I will have to go, isn't it? You are absolutely right, Madam. You don't stay for me. Once you leave... I too will leave this city and go somewhere. When you are gone, I'll miss you at everyplace in this city. But I don't know, where will I go? - Tony. - What? - There's one place. Where? Vienna. With you?! - If you don't mind, can I ask you something. - Go on. Who will explain it to your father? I will do it. Who is that? Do you have a passport? Yes. I had got it made to go to Dubai. - Leave it at the hotel tomorrow. - I don't have a visa. I'll take care of everything. Madam, may I ask you something? You were testing me, isn't it? - No, Tony. - No. - Promise. - I promise. - You were testing me. Neena! Madam! Boom! Boom! Please prepare properly. Take it. I don't believe it. Is it a dream or a reality? Look at me, I'm an ordinary guide while she's a princess. One thing is for sure, Neena. An astrologer had told me... a princess will come in my life whom I'll love very much... and she'll take me away with her. Isn't it a wonderful fairy tale?! You are crying! Get up... come on. Sit... you are an idiot. You think I'll leave you here forget you? Don't I know, after Madam... only Neena loves me the most in the entire world. On reaching there I'll tell Madam to arrange a nice job for me. Then, I'll call you there. Unless I tease you I can't digest my food. I'm writing my house in your name and still you are crying. Don't cry Neena... when you cry something happens to me. Please. I know Tony doesn't love me. He hasn't even seen me properly. Maybe because we don't care for the things which we possess. And then, Sonia came in between us. I'm not sad about this. Because my happiness lies in his happiness. Who else do I have except Tony? I'm very happy today, Tony. Sir, I sent the luggage. But where's Sonia? The flight is at 12 o' clock. I will see. How are you related to Jennifer? She was my mother. - So, you are Haynes daughter? - Yes. I want to talk to you. Come with me. Why did you let her go? Why? Why didn't you tell her that I'll be late. Why did you let her go? Where has she gone? - Sonia. - O my God. Where had you been? We are getting late. - Papa I want to talk to you urgently. - I don't want to hear anything. The flight is taking off. Get inside. - But papa, please. - Get inside. Come on. Where's the passport? I've got it. Forgive me Tony. I made a mistake. I had dreamt about many things. About you and me. But I forgot, dreams never come true... one can only live on hopes. You are lucky, you got what you wished for. The one you loved is with you. In every church of Malaga... I'll light a candle for your happiness and long life. Enjoy yourself as you used to do it here. Don't worry about me. You enjoy. I'll try to live without you. I'll live alone Tony. Don't worry about me. I'll live Tony. Hey Tony! What are you doing here? C'mon, we've to check in. Madam I'll not go with you. - What? - I'll not go with you. You were so excited to go and now... I only thought about my happiness so I couldn't see anything else. But today I've realized after so many years. - Tony! - Madam, I know, you love me very much. You've convinced your father to marry me. - Tony... - But Madam... - I mean... - I know, you can bestow me with happiness, wealth and love. But that will be at the cost of someone's sorrow. That Neena... she'll be all alone when I go away. - She has no one of her own. She will be very lonely. - Neena... I can understand, you must be thinking... why Neena has transpired suddenly. But that poor girl was right with me from the very beginning. She loves me a lot. I realised it today. I am everything for her. She'll die if I go away. She'll definitely... die. It's difficult to suppress one's love. But to break the heart of one who loves you is a grave sin. And this sin, Tony will not commit. Please forgive me. I am sorry. Sonia my darling! When are we going? Where is there mad crazy boy of yours? He has left. I knew it was bound to happen. These people never keep their word. He might have landed some other job better than ours. So he left. Scoundrel! Greedy! No papa, that greedy Indian rejected your daughter. What nonsense! What are you talking? I was frank with him. He thought I was in love with him. And I wanted to marry him. Scoundrel! How dare he? Papa, agreed Tony is poor. But his dreams were high. And today he shattered his dreams because he realised that... Neena loved him and he rejected me, your wealth... and his dream of being a rich man. All for her. And whatever I dreamt... I shattered it for your respect your love. That was not a dream Papa. That was love, true love! Which I have understood today. You gave me all the happiness... but today I beg you for my love. Prem is the biggest happiness of my life. I want to live with him. I'll not let you meet that bloody journalist. He is an Indian. He'll cheat you, just like your mother left us alone. My mother didn't cheat us. But she had learnt, she was suffering from some dangerous disease. So she returned alone to Malaga. So that you and I could live. In a country where loves means sacrifice... how can a woman of that country be a cheat? Only an Indian can make such a big sacrifice. Papa, these are the letters that mummy wrote to you. But she never mailed them. Thank you. I'll ask your mother for forgiveness. And you go to Prem, whom you love. - Thank you papa. - I am sorry. - Thank you, thank you. You remember, I had said, if your love is true... he will definitely come back to you. Look, I have returned. You also eat. I've decided, I'll always have my food after you have it. - Any problem? - No. What happened, Tony? - Sonia madam has followed me here. - Yes. She didn't go with her father. How could she? Her love is here. - How much will I hurt her? - Yes. She looks pale. She looks gloomy. Look at her plight, she can neither laugh nor cry. Doesn't matter. It happens in love. She'll overcome as time passes by. What to do? I'm only one. Go on, eat. Do not worry Tony. Everything think will be all right. Look Tony is sitting there. Go and thank him. Had it not been for him, we wouldn't have met. - Anyway that thing... - No need to say anything. Let him think that a princess came from a far off country... who loved him very much. And he rejected the princess for an ordinary girl. Some dreams are so beautiful that you can't shatter them.
