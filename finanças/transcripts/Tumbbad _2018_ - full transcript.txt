The Goddess of Prosperity ... is the symbol of unlimited gold and food And this earth is her womb When the universe was created... she gave birth to 160 million Gods But the Goddess loved her first child above all ... Hastar But today, you won't find his name in any ancient scriptures Why, father? Because he wanted all of the Goddess' gold and food He managed getting the gold ... but just as he went for the food ... all the other Gods attacked him With every blow, Hastar shattered into fragments But before he could dissolve into stardust, The Goddess saved him But on one condition That he will never be worshiped and be forgotten for ever For aeons, Hastar slept in his mother's womb But one day, our ancestors invoked him And built a shrine in his name They say, since that day, all the Gods' wrath ... has been raining on Tumbbad Why did we even wake him up? Because Hastar's curse is a boon for us What do you mean? You'll know ... when you go inside Inside where? In the Goddess' womb Please, hurry up It's about to get dark It'll take the time it takes I am terrified of not feeding that old hag on time What if she wakes up? Don't say such things at this dark hour She won't wake up If you want to leave in time, then come early You'd promised me that gold coin, after this new moon The coin is not a joke! One has to earn it -Where's mother? -Wait here Where is she? Where else, must be at Sarkar's mansion Who will feed the old woman? Mother will, once she returns -What if she's late? -Shut up! What if the old woman wakes up? She eats while she's asleep? You put it in her mouth, bit by bit, she swallows Does she ever wake up? No Have you ever fed her before? No What's this? I cooked, so you go feed her Go on. Else she'll wake up Go, don't be afraid I say, go on! Sadashiv! Did he give you the gold coin? It didn't come up That bastard will never bring it up You dare to swear at your father? Tell him ... We won't look after his old hag unless he gives us the coin No one else in the village would dare to go close to her The gold coin is not a joke One has to earn it Being his mistress for 12 years hasn't earned it? Mother! Let me go I don't want it I don't want the treasure Let me go Come in Sleep, else Hastar will come for you Mother? Sarkar is dead I know After dinner, we'll start packing We are leaving Tumbbad -There is nothing left for us here. -Why? Don't we inherit the mansion now? There's no one else And starve to death in that ruin? It isn't worth a penny For the village, we are as good as outcastes And the mansion's hidden treasure. Isn't that ours now? Sarkar searched all his life but found nothing Squandered all his ancestral wealth as well What about the old woman? Why should we care now. Let her rot Shall we wake her up? She's Sarkar's great grandmother I'm sure she knows something about the hidden treasure Go! Go ahead Wake her up and ask We leave at dawn, tomorrow And head to 'Pune' Even mentioning the treasure brings ill fortune So, I didn't What is 'Pune'? It's a very big city Where carts move on their own, without horses or bulls I don't believe anything you say, nowadays Fine. Sadashiv! Mother! Sadashiv, don't sleep. I'll be back home by morning What about the old woman's food? -You'll have to feed her tonight. -What if she wakes up? If she wakes up, say ... "Sleep, 'Hastar' will come for you." Who is 'Hastar'? Hurry up. Let's go! -Mother? -You go! Go! Sadashiv, I am here. Everything will be alright, son Sister? Do you still want to go to the doctor? Or should I take us to the graveyard?

Grandma, a tree grew out of you! Why didn't they banish you, after your husband's death? Because they needed me I was the fastest climbing down the well -Is treasure in the well? -Don't go there!

If there was a god whose mere touch ... would turn you immortal ... letting you live for centuries ... and you'd know where the eternal treasure is All you have to do is eat and sleep Would you want that? Who wouldn't want such a blessing? One knows it's not a blessing ... but a curse worse than death! I think I'll be coming back home alone today Why, father? Father, I'm just like you I'm not afraid of anything! I'm not scaring you ... just preparing you for what lies ahead Is that God the same one ... "Sleep or else Hastar will..." -Shh ... Don't utter his name He appears even if you take his name? Since that day, the Gods' wrath has rained on Tumbbad But why did they wake him up? Because Hastar's curse is a boon for us What do you mean? You'll know when you go inside Inside what? The Goddess's womb Mix in these pebbles. He chews through them It buys us more time Listen ... We here just to practice today. We won't need these inside Scared already? We haven't even begun Make a circle. It keeps us safe. He cannot enter it What if he tries to? It will destroy him Remember, he took the gold, but couldn't get the grains Hence, he yearns for flour and dreads it too But what if Hastar bites you? You'll be cursed like grandmother. Get it here Is that the grandmother? No, he was my friend Did Hastar do this? Yes When will Hastar come? When we offer him the dough doll But we're just practicing, that's why we didn't bring it Pull this from here But I got the doll Run, you fool! Father! Wait for me, father You, greedy scum! Didn't I ask you to not get the doll? Didn't I? Sorry ... Stay here. Or I'll chop your head off! Look over there Has gone even blind now Keep it safe, It's your first earning How much will I get if I sell this? Give it back ... quick! I'll keep it safe Until I don't ask for it Tell me, what was there? That's between father and me You focus on household chores Unwrap it Eat it Your father gave this to you? Does he like it too? He doesn't like anything Then what's the point? What do you mean? Mother, what do you mean? Greetings to the free citizen of free India Welcome Raja Sahib This is for the new water station Name it after my wife Now that India is free, how will you keep busy? You think our freedom struggle was to keep us busy? No?

Doesn't match your stature It's time you buy a grander mansion -I have one in Tumbbad ... -Tumbbad? Tumbbad has been given away last week What? If only you'd listened to me We would've drawn out legal papers and it would have been yours Tumbbad is under the lordship of 7 barons I take good care of each of them -That's between you and the barons. -Whom did they give away Tumbbad to? To the new Sarkar Who is this Sarkar? The Indian Government It's a decrepit mansion anyway They'll build a new village there I'll look for something else that matches your status Namaste What is it? Why are you standing like that? What are you staring at? Should I wake up everybody? Father tells you everything, doesn't he? He must've told you about this as well I'm his partner now And soon I'll be the only one running the show You do know what I mean, right? Father has kept you as a mistress ... No big deal in that. Everyone has one But when I grow up, I'll marry you Are you crazy? How old are you? Does that matter to you? If not Tumbbad, at least the mansion is ours, right? The government will lock it up too But why? You fool Come here Idiot Take the keys, stupid Here Open Pull harder So much gold!

The coins are in its loincloth, so why not just steal the loincloth? -What? -Let's steal 'Hastar's' loincloth You want 'Hastar's' loincloth, bastard? How much time can we buy with that doll? We pick what we can and run! We will take many dolls As soon as he picks one, we'll throw another and so on Father ... it won't take us long to steal the loincloth Will he eat so many dolls? Didn't you say he's always hungry? I know it's difficult But it's possible Come here Father, I am sorry. I will not do it again Remain in your pants for a few years. We'll get you married soon! And till then? And till then! He plays hide and seek, like the Reaper Spins a web of laughter and cries He stares into your soul with lust Hits you at every turn, like kingdom come For ages he has starved Waiting unfulfilled, unnourished He endlessly eats stones-pebbles-wheat Eternally thirsty, drinks with gruesome greed Ears quiver, bearings adrift He's the god of death, life and heart shiver Come, come conquer Tumbbad. Go, go revel in Tumbbad The clouds erupt, yet my soul Burns like an ember Every moment, my mind splits, my body is pierced . The world is up in the air Come here Hold this Shall we begin, father? Stop! Put the dolls back! Father! Father! Please, no We'll find another way Father, don't do this please Take the dolls off, father! Father don't do this. Father! Father? Take it The loincloth! Come Take it Take it! Didn't you want this? Didn't you want this? -No No! -Take it! -No. Father, go to sleep ... Father, sleep or 'Hastar' will come for you
