Lord, give me the patience for these horses, and the strength to shovel all that outta that pen. - All right now, let's walk up to the door. We're gonna meet him, and it's all gonna be fine. Trust me. Hello, I'm Mary Morgan and I'm looking for William Moore. - That's me, I go by Daniel. - My sister, Rebecca Morgan, has just passed away. - Rebecca passed away? I'm sorry to hear that. - And um, I got some paperwork that says you're the father to her child. - I have a daughter? Let me see that. - And I brought her to stay here with you. - Look, I don't have a room set up for her or anything. Maybe we can make some arrangements, and you can come back at a later time. - No, I, I can't take her right now. I've got to, I've got a lot going on, and I think she needs to be with her father. - If she's got nowhere to go, I'll take care of my responsibility. Come on. - You'll be all right. - Come on in and have a seat. So what's your name? - Danny. - Danny? - It's short for Daniela. - Hmm. She named you after me. - I doubt that. - You hungry? I can make up some more. - Some more? Looks like you have enough there to feed an army. - No, this is all for me. Around here, we work hard and we eat hard. - Who's we? - It was just me and the animals. But now it's you and me. Now when we're done eating, we need to talk about chores. - I don't do chores. - You will now, 'cause you're gonna earn your keep around here. You came at the perfect time, harvest season. - So that's what you do? You're just a farmer? - Just a farmer? Farming's the most important job you could have. Young lady, without farming, you wouldn't eat. - I'm not a young lady. I don't even wanna be here. - Lord, you're gonna have to help me with this one. That's one wild filly. - Oh, wow. Your head is huge. I've never pet a horse before. Want some? How come you have to be fenced in? That's not fair. - They're too wild and young. Horses have to learn manners before we can let 'em out on their own. - Maybe humans need to learn to understand them just as they are. - Maybe so. Hey, I was thinking, I'm gonna be busy with harvest. How 'bout you help me take over the horse chores? - Me? Really? - Unless you consider it a chore. I can have you sweepin' the house, cleaning, doing the laundry. Do you sew? - I'll do it, the horses. Just teach me how. - Come on. First things first. They get a half bucket of grain every morning with their hay. Here's the hay bale. 6:00 AM every morning, the hay bale, the bucket of grain. Got it? You haven't been corn fed, have ya? It's okay, we'll get some weight on ya. Oh by the way, they weigh 40 to 50 pounds. I forgot to tell ya. They don't just get one in the morning. They get one at night, 6:00 PM. So, can you handle it? - Yes, I got it. - Have at it. Always make sure they have clean, fresh water. And oh, by the way, you're gonna need this. - What's this for? I can't believe this is my life now. I can see why cowboys wear boots now. - I came to take the load for you. I can't let you out anyway, 'cause Silver's out there. You might get hurt. - What's wrong with Silver? - She's just young and hasn't been trained yet. She's afraid of everything. - Why do you have them if you can't use them? - I saved both of them from going to the meat market. - Meat market? That's a real thing? - See, farmers don't have a lotta use for a young horse. Hard to sell because they're not trained. Hard to train 'cause it takes a lotta time. Farmers don't have a lotta time to spare. Number one reason is it costs a lotta money to raise two Belgians. That's a draft horse breed. Strongest draft horse breed in the world. - Wow. But you still didn't answer the question. Why did you save them? - You can kinda say I was coerced into it. A friend of mine saved these two from the auction, brought 'em to me, and she wanted to know if I had a good enough heart to take 'em in. And I said yes. - She? - She's just a friend, a good neighbor. She's rescued a lotta horses, and her barn is full. - I guess that's nice. - I figured they'd be some good use later down the road, pulling some logs, some stones, maybe even a sleigh ride. - Oh my gosh, that would be amazing. Mm, mm, whatever. Cool. - Well, there's no guarantees I'm keeping 'em, if she can find 'em a good home. I'm gonna take this. After you get cleaned up, why don't you take a look around the property. You might find that you like this old farm. - I guess maybe I could take a look around. ♪ My mama told me ♪ ♪ Don't run from who you are ♪ ♪ Don't sell yourself ♪ ♪ Don't sell your soul ♪ ♪ Well you'll go far ♪ ♪ When I think it over and what it cost me to play ♪ ♪ I didn't sell myself ♪ ♪ I didn't sell my soul ♪ ♪ I gave myself away ♪ ♪ But I've been a-rescued, rescued ♪ ♪ I've been rescued ♪ ♪ From the enemy ♪ ♪ I've been a-rescued, rescued ♪ ♪ I'll pay you what it costs ♪ ♪ To walk away ♪ ♪ My daddy told me it's a hornet's nest out there ♪ ♪ When you get stung, don't hide your pain ♪ ♪ It'll show up in the face you wear ♪ - Oh, wow. ♪ This store's not open ♪ ♪ There ain't nothing on display ♪ ♪ 'Cause I didn't sell myself, I didn't sell my soul ♪ ♪ I gave myself away ♪ ♪ But I've been a-rescued, rescued ♪ ♪ I have been rescued ♪ ♪ From the enemy ♪ ♪ I've been a-rescued, rescued ♪ ♪ I'm paying what it costs to walk away, walk away ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ I could see a part of me is gone ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're giving me words to a different song ♪ ♪ And I need to be strong ♪ ♪ 'Cause it be won't be wrong for me to say to yesterday ♪ ♪ So long ♪ ♪ My mama told me ♪ - Ow.

I should collect these. I found them. - Looks like you found your way around the property okay. Thank you for collecting the eggs. Are you ready for supper? - Sure. Yeah, that's fine. - You're cooking. No, I'm joking. - Do you have an Xbox or something? - What's an Xbox? - Seriously? Do you have a TV? - No TV. - Oh my gosh. What do you do for fun? - I work the land, tend the animals. In the evening, I look forward to a hot meal and some cowboy coffee. I read my Bible. Sometimes Fern comes over, we play cards. You like cards? Can you play? I can play a mean game of cards. - My life is over. Oh, I've fallen into another dimension where there's no technological advancement, no entertainment, no fun. Are you even online? - Online? - Oh. - I got a lotta food here. You hungry? Looks like they're hungry too. They've really taken a liking to you lately. Hey, maybe I can get you one of those Xbox things for your birthday or something. When's your birthday? - It's called an Xbox. My birthday's September 15th. - The 15th? That's in two weeks. - Yeah. I'll be turning 16. My mom wanted to throw me a sweet 16 party, but sweet 16 parties are dumb. - Fern, I need you to come over. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I could really use help on something. I just found out I have a daughter. Look, her mother died. She's gonna be living here now. I don't even have a bedroom set up for her. I don't have any clothes, hygiene items. Worst of all, her birthday's in two weeks. I'm trying to build a relationship with her. I have to do something for her birthday. It's her sweet 16th birthday. I don't know much about girls, or women, but I do know that's a special birthday. Thanks for coming. - I bought her a few shirts and some boots. I hope these fit okay. - She's gonna need 'em. She's been mucking the stalls in sandals. You look great. Where you coming from? - I just happened to be uptown when you called. - Her mother was a stubborn one. That's why things didn't work out. I didn't know she had a baby. Now here I am with a teenage daughter. I have no clue what I'm doing. - Don't worry. I'm here to help. I need you to casually find out what she likes to do. What's her favorite band? What are her favorite colors? And I'll take it from there. - She said something about a Xbox thing or something? I don't even know what that is. - Okay, she's a gamer. You're gonna need to get a TV, and I'll help you find the Xbox. - Thank you, Fern. You're a lifesaver. - It's no problem. Call me when you find out those answers, and I'll start planning the party immediately. Oh, I almost forgot. My nieces are gonna be in town. I'll bring 'em to the party. She'll have some extra friends. - Thank you. - It's going to be fine. Just be yourself. Give her some time to warm up to you. She's been through a lot. Take it slow, just like the horses that come out of bad situations. They need time to process their new home, and time to heal. - That's good advice. - I don't know if I can be happy here like you, boy. How do you deal with not having a mother? You were only babies when you were forsaken. I understand how you feel. - Hey, Fern brought you a few clothes. You might wanna change before bed. - What is this? - Farm clothing. - Thanks. - You can sleep on the couch until I can get a bedroom set up for you. Fern's gonna work on the bedroom arrangements, and she also wanted to know what your favorite color was and what kinda things you like. - I like the color black and sometimes blue. - Do you like music? - I love music. Queen is my favorite band. - I see. Well, I have a Victrola here and plenty of records. You're welcome to 'em anytime you'd like. - Thanks. - Time to go to bed. Remember to do your chores early in the morning. - Yeah. - Do you remember the time? - Six. - 6:00 AM. See you then. - Looks like you had some bad luck with that window. It might be that hat you're wearing. - What's wrong with my hat? - Just, I'm from the city where everything has to match, and you don't match. - Well here on the farm, we wear what's practical. What do you got there? - I found this in the shed. What is it? - That's what we collect the apples in. This is an apple farm. Haven't you looked around? Come on. If you look around, you probably can find a few fallen apples. We have a few weeks till the rest of 'em come in. But I usually take the fallen ones and I give 'em to the animals. Have at it. - Look, apples. - Yeah, this is the winner. We'll see if she likes this. Now this is the city. Oh, I guess I gotta ditch the hat. Okay. It sounds like the city, and it looks like the city. I thought you'd be more comfortable if I looked like I lived in the city. What do you think about my shirt? - I'm glad to see you at least changed your shirt. I thought you were gonna wear that other dirty old thing for years. - Well I asked you if you could do laundry or not. - And at least you took that ridiculous looking hat off. - How's Danny doing? - She's still a little depressed. - I bet she is. - I'm doing the best I can to cheer her up. - I'm sure you're doing just fine. - Look, I, I need to ask you a question. What happened to her mother? - Her mother died of cancer. She fought it for three years, and just couldn't fight anymore. - I wish I knew, I could've been there for both of 'em. - It's not your fault, but I wouldn't talk about it right now. - Don't worry, I'm not gonna bring her mother up. - I think that's best. - Okay. - She just needs to process everything. - I'm gonna give her some time. - She'll warm up to you soon. - I hope you're right. - Goodbye. - I'll talk to you later. Did your mother ever tell you how we met? - No. She never said anything about you. - I used to travel about, in the rodeos. I never fell off a bull once, until the day I saw your mother. Prettiest cowgirl I've ever seen. I almost made the eight seconds, until I looked in the crowd and I laid eyes on your mother. I lost focus for a split second. I fell to the ground. I looked up, she was laughing at me. I ran up to her as fast as I could, and I asked her to dinner. She came to me after a few months, and she told me it was time to give it up. - The rodeo? - The rodeo. Told me it was her or the ride. I told her she was being selfish. She left and never came back. Now I understand why she left me. And why she wanted me to give up the rodeo. She didn't wanna be left at home alone with a child. And if I knew back then, I would've gave it up for sure. Looks like the horses are hungry. You better get to your chores. Time for some cowboy coffee. - Jack's sick. He's sick and I know it. He's barely moving, he's not eating. His eyes are all sad and watery. Can horses cry? 'Cause if they can, he's crying. - He's probably half asleep like me. It's too early to eat. - He looks like he's in pain, and I don't know what to do. - Look, I gotta get on the tractor today. I'm gonna send Fern over to check him out. - You did great by calling someone immediately. Once he starts eating, everything will be fine. Could just be something he ate. I'll let Daniel know when he gets back off the tractor. Just keep him cool and in the shade. Give me a call if he looks worse. Okay? - Yeah. - There's a good chance it could be colic. - Colic? - He was pretty malnourished when he came to us. Doesn't have the strongest immune system. - I don't understand. I have fresh hay. We check the hay. - It's gonna take a miracle, but if anybody can pull through, it's Jack. Let me know if you need me. - Thanks for coming. Fern thinks it might be a colic. - What's colic? - It's something that can kill horses. - What can we do? - Make sure he gets the rest that he needs. Fresh food, clean water. And pray. Lots of prayers. Good news is, we caught it early, so he still has a fighting chance. I'm gonna leave you two alone. - Hear that, boy? You're gonna be just fine. I already lost my mother, Jack. You can't go. I love you so much. You have to stay here with me. God please, please don't take Jack from me. I couldn't bear it. Please let him get better. Please take his sickness away. - I have some supper on the table if you're hungry. I'll take care of him. Go get some rest. It'll be okay. You're a good boy, and you're a strong boy. You don't go leaving me now, Jack. You don't go leaving me now. You hang in there. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't take care of you better, boy. Praise the Lord, he's eating. Good boy. Eat up, Jack. Eat up. Let me go tell her the good news. Jack's eating. - All right, we're all set. The girls are hiding. We just need to get you in your costume. - Surprise. I have 16 presents for you, for every year I missed. Happy Sweet 16. First thing I'm gonna do is give you this jacket, 'cause I'm gonna go change. ♪ Let me tell you about the place I lived ♪ ♪ It had four walls, and evil in the halls ♪ ♪ Let me tell you about the friends I had ♪ ♪ They had only in mind to try to find that kind ♪ ♪ And I lived there so long ♪ ♪ I thought there was no way out ♪ ♪ And now you came along ♪ ♪ And you took away the hurt of my memories ♪ ♪ You took away the hurt of my memories ♪ ♪ Let me tell you 'bout the fun I had ♪ ♪ It was a long fears, and took away my years ♪ ♪ Let me tell you 'bout the life I lived ♪ ♪ I thought so many times, I was better off dead ♪ ♪ And I lived there so long ♪ ♪ I thought there was no way out ♪ ♪ Until you came along and took away ♪ - I might not have been there the first 16 years, but I'm here now. And I wanna tell you that you are the most important thing in my life now, and you mean the world to me, and that I love you. And if you want a father, I'm here. You look different. I can't put my finger on it. - Probably 'cause I actually brushed my hair for once. - Thanks for everything. It was awesome. - You're welcome. - I'll call you. - I think things went very well for you. - You really like her, don't you? - I do. - I kind of hate her, but she plans good parties. - She does. It turned out great. - Well, you can say whatever you wanna say, but it's clear that she's got the hots for you. - What? How do you know? - Isn't it obvious? Do you notice the way she's always fixing her hair when she's around you? The way she smiles and looks away. She's always batting her eyelashes. - Hmm. That means she likes me? - Most of the time, that's what it means. But, you don't have to like her back though. - Like your new guitar? - Yeah. I can't play it though. - You'll learn in due time. - Yeah. - I've got a surprise for you. Fern rescued a litter of bunnies and she thought your dad would want you to have one. - Oh my gosh, a bunny? A bunny's in that box? - Yeah, come on, let me get her out for you. - Oh! My gosh. Oh. Hi there. - How's the farm life been treating you? - It's hard. Sometimes I miss the city. But, I do really like the animals. Taking care of them has been a fun kind of challenge. - Fern will be finding a home for the horses any day now. Then you won't have as much animals to take care of. - No, I hope she doesn't find a home for the horses. I've grown rather attached to them. I think we have some sort of bond, especially Jack and me. I kinda want them to stay here, you know? Or never find a home with anyone else. I know it sounds selfish, but they are safe here and we take great care of them. - That makes sense. I didn't wanna give this bunny up either. I'll leave you with your new friend. I'm going to the auction with Fern, and we're gonna see what new animal we can rescue. Bye. - Yeah. You gonna be happy here? - Hi, Danny. How have you been? - I've been fine. - Good, good. I, I meant to call you yesterday on your birthday. - Yeah. - I'm sorry I couldn't get to it, but I'll wish you happy birthday today, late. - Yeah. Okay, that's cool. - How are things going? - Everything's fine. The farm is better than I expected. It's not as lame. - So, how are you and your dad doing? - It's good. He's great. You know, he threw an awesome party. He's cooler than I expected as well. - Okay, I just wanted to call and check on you, make sure things are going all right. You seem pretty happy. - Definitely. - Well, great. I'm so glad to hear that. But I've gotta run, and it's nice to talk to you again. - It was nice talking to you too. - Bye. ♪ Angels ♪ ♪ Oh, oh hallelujah. ♪ - Are you ready, Jack? Are you gonna be a good boy today?
