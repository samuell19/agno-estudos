I think someone is telling a joke They'll be calling up from all over the country wishing you many happy returns I told them that it wasn't your birthday Well,boys,all over the country We've done it -Doctor -Doctor -Well -They're due to start in about a minute,Sir As soon as they do we'll find their position on this map -Nagel -Sir? Just explain to Herr Rabenau,will you We pick up the waves from Freedom radio on detectors placed about 200 miles apart For example Berlin and Breslau By taking the maximum intensity of these waves each of these stations can get the direction of the pirate station in relations to their own position and where these two direction intersect is the rough position of the pirate transmitter How exactly do you do that? Do you see that instrument over there,Sir Let me explain That's what we call a directive aerial This man finds the direction of maximum intensity from the freedom station Meanwhile we receive a reading from Breslau by plotting both these readings on the map as you saw obtain the point of intersection This is the freedom station calling on short wave 26.9 "There we are going to take up some problems that affects us all" -There's your blib -Breslau bearing 95 degree east Breslau 95 degrees West It's someone in Ostertal district,Sir Squad car attention stop all traffic entering city from North Search for radio transmitter -About a mile northeast of Ostertahl -About a mile northeast of Ostertahl Ostertahl,it's about 12 miles from here Just coming into Ostertahl -That's the peak South 21 West 14 -South 21 West 14 North 2 West 28 We are doing everything we can Sir I got all my best men working day and night Karl It's almost time Ready to go Right -Ready? -Just about There you are Professor This is freedom station message Right This is a freedom station calling on wavelength 26.9 I'll tell you we must find them I had another call from Berchtesgarden this morning How can I find them if Goebbels keeps jamming them out Now we have absolute proof that your criminal leaders are investing millions of marks in foreign securities Here are the figures everyone of them has been verified Rabenau who presumes to tell you to turn your butter into guns has the depositions in the following sums abroad Buenos Aires 7,5 million marks in Luxemburg 2 million That wasn't jammed was it? Muller,you occupy a position of responsibility So far you've been lucky enough to keep that position The third Reich does not tolerate failures I think you understand me Well,that's the list Something to think about isn't it? How long are we going to put up with this whole scale thieving of public funds by our ministers of state Hanna it's Karl,he's come back What swollen dreams do you suppose these men hold while you at the same time hold death and misery for you,the people How funny -I thought for a minute that was -Karl Yes That was the freedom radio Ridiculous Must be some resemblance in the voice Quite a strong resemblance I'd thought Don't be stupid Otto Hanna All right duckie, I'm just getting them Well I must be off Aren't you going to wait for me? I'm afraid I can't do it, there's a job I must do I'll be home later All right good night She seemed to note it at once she actually called out his name when she opened the door You don't like Dr Roeder very much,do you? It's not that,Sir,I thought it was my duty to tell you It was indeed You've done very well my boy I'm just wondering if we can't make more use of your special advantages What about taking him into your detection unit,Muller I'll be very glad to have him,Sir Thank you,Sir Report to Capt Muller's office in the morning -Heil Hitler -Heil Hitler Well,that's a very pretty surprise You're going to arrest Roeder? No, we need more evidence than to arrest the Fuhrer's doctor besides we want the others too I'm going to give a little party at my house Dr Roeder should be the guest of honor -He'd smell a rat -That's the idea Suppose we ask him for 1015 just before the broadcast -I'll ask her too -I thought they weren't living together They are not Her reaction should be very entertaining Irena it's your turn now -Won't you please do something? -No -Oh,please do You really must let me off tonight I've been at the stadium all day What little surprise have you got in stall for us this time One that I think ought to be rather good when the Fuhrer comes in a 140 foot banners were unfurl in the wind Which reminds me really I don't think I ordered the wind I'll talk to Goebbels We don't want a hurricane you know when our good doctors exaggerate things There was a message from Karl,he's been delayed at the clinic He'll be along later BTW the so called freedom station is on the air just now might be amusing to hear what they have to say Yes I don't think we shall have any more opportunities "And tonight the minister of propaganda has once more been telling you that our envious neighbor are preparing to invade Germany and destroy her people that too is a lie" Invented to excuse preparations " I won't listen to that stuff Oh quite,but there is something about that voice Oh yes,do let's hear some more,it's so thrilling Please I'm sorry Karl missed that As he might have found it amusing Sorry I'm late,Willie Oh hello Karl Listen tomorrow night at 10 30 as usual Tell your friends to tune in on wave length 26.9 meters And in the mean time,good night Let me help you Thank you Good night,Irena Won't you see me home? Of course Well,there's one thing we can take Roeder off the list and start looking elsewhere On the contrary we can now concentrate on Roeder Very easy to put a voice on a gramophone record but very hard to conceal the scratch -You've been busy at the stadium? -What?

Why did you do it? I did it because I had to do it Because I saw people I love rushing to destruction I saw that many who felt as I did were powerless as individuals but if we could only find a way to putting them in touch with each other uniting their strength the disaster may be averted The freedom station the way we found What do you want to do? Start a revolution? Yes,revolution You believe that Hitler is working for peace,but you are wrong In three days our army will march into Poland Then I decided to tell the nation something of vital importance Just as it was I don't believe it But it's true Then why didn't you tell them today? I was cut off before I could Tonight I shall tell them If it's the last thing I do And it will be You think you are brave but nothing but a fool or worse you're a traitor They'll kill you and you'll deserve it You haven't a chance after this afternoon -I saw the Gestapo outside here -They found nothing But what about me? I suppose you think I'm going to shield you because I'm your wife No Irena I don't expect you to Oh God This is a nightmare I want to wake up Karl,what have they done to us? Got us everyone I must go Karl Where are you going? Please tell me I must know Remember? Karl,I got to talk to you Irena there's no time now Karl What am I to do? You must do what's your conscience tells you If you feel it's your duty to report me I shall understand And you know where to tell them to find me Otto what are you doing here?

I'm going straight to Gestapo headquarters Perhaps you'll understand that Of course,I'm going with you You'd better not I warn you I shall tell them the truth I shall tell them the truth That'll be the end of freedom radio Don't try and fool me Fool you? Never once I was fooling if I never acted well before I did then You weren't acting You've been crying My dear child how many years have I been on stage? And you know that one of the first thing that you learn is to cry convincingly As a matter of fact also one of the easiest No one would have told me whether we were going if I hadn't turn on the tears You can say what you like you still love him You wouldn't lift a finger against him Love him I hate him He's a traitor Played right into my hands I know where the freedom station is Are you coming? Did he give yous any hint as to where he's going? He said he was going to Oberstad He didn't say that Where did he say? He didn't mention any place Otto couldn't have heard we were just outside the door that's were they've gone well that simplifies matters a good deal We should be able to get them all now Well,Irena,I can't thank you enough Dressler,stay where you are,I want you We know of course what they intended to say at the meeting Of what? Our troops about to march into Poland They know by giving the public a piece of news like that they're creating immense difficulties But it's not to,of course,we are not attacking Poland,are we? Yes it's true enough,it was forced on us Naturally you'll keep all this to yourself Of course Thank you again,you helped us enormously I'm very glad that I helped you, I hope you catch them That won't take long now Good bye She was lying wasn't she? -Well I -I see you agree with me She is very much in love with him I do have the well meaning she will not get into any That's all right I'll see that she's kept out of it Tell me exactly what you heard -You say he didn't mention a name? -No,Sir What did he say then? She asked him where they were going He didn't say anything at first Then he said something about "Remember?" He's knocking on something Like that -Like that? -Yes,Sir Where were you? Right behind that door,Sir -That one? -Yes,Sir Where do you think he was? Somewhat about here Of course I can't be sure No,of course not Probably the desk Or something on it Or perhaps You know where this is?

Yes I think so Why? No one called at the clinic? Just getting interested where you'd been or anything like that? My dear fellow what are you worrying about?
