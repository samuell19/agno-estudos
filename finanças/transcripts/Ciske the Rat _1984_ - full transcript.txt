There is a card from your father. See you aunt. Gently with the door. Can you never come on time? D'r has leaked a barrel in the basement, bring a mop. Hey joke, Give me a head butt, and take one yourself. Is that your husband? - Perhaps. Cis, hurry up Henry, where are you now? I would like to get to know you better. Klerejong that you are. Goddamnit. Little adder, I'll do you something again. What do you look like, I can't use you like this here. I'll just go home. The pennies don't grow on my back. Apologize. - Tomorrow. Small adder. Fall dead whore, I'll tell dad. Pokkewijf. Help. Chris. Help. Chris, do something. - Marie the children. Help. Help. Help. Vrijmoeth. Do you dare against such a small bottom door? Hey grandpa. Come on Rat, come to Mr. Van Loon Surely you can't set things on fire just like that? Did she say that? What a shitty guy. That's not how you talk about your mother. Isn't that right? If my father were there... Yes Yes, learn to close your big mouth first. Ciske, you're leaving home for a while. - The further the better. Do you see what kind of preference it is? Well madam then you will still have to come with your husband. Perhaps we will find a solution together. This is Mr. Pieksma, Your supervisor for the time that you are here. Cis Vrijmoeth. What the hell? - Shut up. Hurry, the light will go out in five minutes. The third... The third bed from behind, that's where you sleep. Hurry up dude. Klaas, what are you doing? - His suitcase is broken, sir. Get into your bed forward. Vrijmoeth you too, hurry up. You can unpack tomorrow. Hurry up. Is it finished? Hey, psst. What's your name? Yes, hurry up. Forward. Hey, what's your name? - Silence. Vrijmoeth, hands above the covers. Above the blankets. Pfff, Man you get better. Yes, people actually play football here or what about that? Is the guy going? Again by boys, Here with that ball. He's for your friend. Hey. Why doesn't that man just take off his dress? Is it much easier? That is not allowed by the boss. - Who is that? That's the last time. Come on. Just break boys. Nobody can beat you. Do I have anything on you? - Do you dare, against all those little ones? With me you wouldn't get rid of it that easily. Do I have to be afraid of you? Hey, do you really think you can handle it? Do you want to play instead of me? Well come on, ask the curate. Chaplain, can he play for me instead? Fine. I'm chaplain de Goey. And you? Cis Vrijmoeth. Cis, from Franciscus? Why are you sitting here? - Thanks to my mother. You don't have to tell me. Well, let's see what you're worth. Oeff. Silence. Cis Vrijmoeth, come here. Well? Hands out. If we have to hit here then we will. And now, Enjoy your meal. Well, take a look at this one, And what do you think of when you see that? Come up with a story. Once upon a time there was a man and a woman. - Yes. And further? They wanted to see what the sea looked like. And what happened then? - I do not know. Well, then we go to the next one. What do you think of that? A child who lost her doll. - How did that happen? Because her mother had thrown it away. Good. And this, what do you feel when you look at it? I don't know. 'Comrades. Get ready to kill. " "Mussert has to leave." "Fear the union." "And come all to our house on Sunday..." Stop it. Get out. Eej Theo. Open the door. - Keep it up yes. Look who we have there. - Bye mother. Welcome home boy. have a seat. Can I offer you, maybe something? No, thank you. Has he been good on the way? - As easy as a lamb. I am not disturbing? No, I'm glad you were kind enough to pick up Cis Hey Cis? Have you been able to arrange it with that new school? He can start right away, but it didn't go very well. What is that director a pus. If only he can agree with that. If you help him out a bit, you'll be fine... ... hey Cis? Well, hold on, right? you know what you promised me. I'll figure it out myself. Au. So, you still owed it to me. And honey, well I like a beer. Hurry up children, hurry up. Are you master Bruis? Bruis, you are asked. What can I do for you? I'm Cis Vrijmoeth. My mother said I came to class with you. Oh that's right. I told you about that lady, right? Oh then you are that boy... ... from that inkwell. We have a decent school here I hope you behaved. Come. Master the Rat, he was in prison. To your place CUT WITH FINGERS Ciske. Ciske, you sit next to Kees. Master I don't want him to sit next to me. And why don't you want him to sit next to you? Jan, don't worry about it, do you? You sit down next to Gerard. Hurry up dude. Are you comfortable? What do you say? Yes. - Yes who? Yes sir. Scriptures. Bajes customer. - Leave it alone, it didn't hurt you. Where do you live? - Stinky. Father. Ciske. Look at this. - You look like brothers. Well I want an ice cream. - Go ahead. Well are you coming monkey? What is her name? - Jans. What does she know about me? - Everything. Everything? - Yes. Open it up. And? - Didn't they have them smaller? Give it here. - Thank you. Why does she want you to stay ashore? She can't miss me for a day. What kind of work do you want to do? - I'll get what I can get. But first I'll talk to your mother. She will probably complain again that I'm late. Did you have to stay again? - It's my fault he's so late. Oh, are you in the country again? Cozy. How are you? You look good. - Thank you. Do you want to drink something from me? - Give me a beer. I heard you have a new friend. Did Cis say that? Ah. Children immediately see something in everything. Not that I care. Cheers. To your health. What would you say if we got divorced? If you stay married to me If you can get 10 others on each hand. Then you have nothing, right? - At least you pay something. After the divorce, I give you alimony every month. I've never seen you so generous. What's in it for you? - Nothing. Except Cis. You'd rather lose it than get rich. Think about it again. - I will certainly do that. Stinky. My husband wants a divorce. What do you think? Divorce? You're crazy if you do that. And what if I meet a good guy... ... who wants to marry me? Then you still have enough time for it? Hey, you like it, right? Unless of course you already have someone in mind. Well eh. No. Hey Marie, you talk about your free time. Every month your money and as free as a bird in the sky. Did you want to give up all that? They are fighting throughout the city. It seems that they have already shot one. Colijn they have to turn his fat head off, the bastard. Oh yeah? And what do you know about it? This country needs a strong man. And no slampampers, who dare not make decisions. For a strong man you have to be in Germany. Yes. And at least they know what to do with that work-unwilling rig. Complain day their wife and children have nothing to eat. And then sit in the caf√© all day long. Shouldn't that kid go to bed? He is about to fall over. Cis, home. The police just couldn't take it anymore, they had to call in the army. They are always the poor they need, the rich are getting richer all the time. Is that true everywhere? Support recipients always die. Hey Rat. Are you in? Comma. I hit them. Vrijmoeth. Rooster. Come along. Bennie, boy. I've been so worried about you. Well better late than never. From now on you keep your son off the street at night. If I get him here again he'll go to the school. Over my dead body. Even better, you go to the cemetery and your son to the disciplinary school. In this way we come a long way in the right direction. The Rat, stay here. Are you in politics nowadays? - I only helped a little. Mr. van Loon will be surprised... ... if he hears that you are already staying here now. Or do you think he won't find out? Come on, I'll take you home. Can I talk to your mother right away? She hits me rotten. - Then you deserve it this time. Mrs. Vrijmoeth. Where did you hang out last night? Hey? - With us. He was arrested by the riots. You can still be lucky that he lives Because there have been deaths. What does that 11-year-old boy do at night on the street? Can't you even keep it at home? I didn't know better if he was in his nest. - She's lying bursting. And still have chats too? I don't know what to do with that kid. I don't know anymore. If you let it screw on like this, we'll automatically remove it from you once, then you're off for good. You know that I am all alone? I'm trying. But I just can't handle it. Yes yes, I notice that. You will hear about it. The rat. Dorus comes to our class until we know how far he is behind. Thank you. Look guys, Dorus is back again. Master who doesn't come to our class? Do you want to keep your big mouth shut Jan. He has bad clothes and is contagious. - Do you know what is contagious? That very big mouth of yours. Soon we will have it all. He can sit next to me. - Haa the Rat is crazy. Get out. So. Thanks to Ciske. Scriptures. Thirty hey. Kees, fine. Um. Ciske. I am a nice boy, I always dress well. On festive days, I wear a top hat. The neighborhood cannot do that many, when I go walking on Sunday. Then all the boys call, from us after. Just stay, it's me. This is Aunt Jans. Bye Ciske. And how do you find her? - Hello Miss. Father, I have to go now. He stinky... - Cor, you have to give him a little more time. What do we do if she refuses? - Leave that to me. So dude, old giant. I do not have time. - I'm just bringing the papers. What kind of paper? The papers of our divorce, have you forgotten? Who says I want a divorce? We talked about that or not? Take it again. I don't think about it. - Don't be a hard person. I have never had a hard time, have I? - That must also be added. Oh yeah? Well with this thing here I certainly have nothing to do. And that young one there is probably also not a Vrijmoeth. The old giant. You let anyone sew you anyway. How dare you. I've never looked at another. I understand you, but I warn you. If you get it from someone else and I'll find out. Then you won't get a cent at all. Get out. And you don't have to see Ciske anymore. - Don't let your crates get stinky. You stay here. We will see who is in charge here. Is my father her? - No, he just left. When can I come and live here? - If you wait a while, you can ask m yourself. "I don't have time, just give him my regards. Bye. Bye. Let the rat suffocate, come with us. - I don't want to go with you at all. Leave him alone he has done nothing to you. Shut up. Let him go yes. - Stop. Oof. Let him go. Stay away from him. Aaahh. Do I have to go to another school again? - Could be. Why did you also have to take a knife? Couldn't you finish it with your bare hands? I don't want to go to another school. You're not gonna tell me you've found your niche? I do not know. I'll see what I can do for you. I don't think about it. I don't let such a small criminal ruin the atmosphere here. I'm sorry Mr. Maatsuyker... ... but you were aware of his background when you took it here. You cannot just send it away. - We'll see about that. I'm going to the education inspector. - You do what you cannot do. I'm still head of this school. As long as you know that, detective. I've never seen that man so angry. - Old fool. And instead of being 'the jerk of a Jan van Kerk... ... sending it off the lane, the rat has to believe it again. Isn't that what you said at all? Can't he just send him out of school? Sure he can. But can I still try? The rat likes being here. Am I mistaken or are you really fond of him? Is that so strange? - You could help him. The juvenile court judge wants the rat to have a guardian. Nothing for you? For me? Why not? Beats two birds with one stone. Maatsuyker can't get it away anymore. And Cis gets a guardian who can use it. What can it be? Mrs. Vrijmoeth, I am Ciske's teacher. Bruis is my name. What did he do again? - I'm just coming to meet you. So. I was asked if I Ciske's guardian. Guardian? - Marie, where is my order? Why don't I know anything about that? So honey. Same thing again. Very busy here? Oh, well. I want to go again? It's coming. Please Mr. Oosterbaan. Is a friend of my husband. What is Ciske doing here? - You see that, right? Destroy it. And clean up that mess. Hurry up. Let go of that boy. Depends on your wages Marie. What do you think Stay here, he will stay here. Do you know that child labor is forbidden? I have nothing more to say about my own child? Ciske comes along, and if not... ... then the police will be at the door in half an hour. She always told me that he was already fourteen. Little traitor. I will teach you to link your mother. I didn't say anything. Sssst. Ciske. Do you go to bed on time? Is something wrong? I really want to help you. - There is nothing at all. Hey rat. Hello Mom. - Hello. Day. Can we just come in? I wanted to ask you something. Yes of course. Please. - Great, thank you. Look what I got. - You know how I feel about it. Please sir, we'll really take good care of him. I want so badly. Hey, Joop Well, if only you make sure he doesn't get cold. Ho but. Ho off. Get dressed, hurry up. Boys. CLIPS IN HANDS. Food. Kommop, quick. Is it ok Dorus? What is beautiful here. I'm glad I was allowed to come. Who wants a sandwich? Catch, catch, catch... There it is. Au. Aah. You bastards. Aah. Ouch. Auw. Dirty red. I'll get you. Do you see Cis? - No. Ciske, come see who's there. Father. - Hey, stinky. Look Dorus, that's Aunt Jans. Aunt Jans. Father. Hey, stinky. - Have you been cold? No. Hey, Dorus. Well stinky. I would have liked it too, otherwise I wanted it. But we will still have to postpone it. When I get back, we'll see further. Maybe she changed her mind by then. I do not believe it. I will write to you often. - No, I'll just go. Hello Aunt Jans. - Bye, honey. I'll take you to the door. Promise me that you will be extra sweet to Aunt Jans. She is expecting. Do you understand why we want to get married as quickly as possible? You can help us. Does she still associate with Henry? The longer, the more. He stays asleep now. Great, if you keep track of how often and when it comes... ... then we have proof. And then she can't stop the divorce. Shall I also see what they eat in the bedroom? No no, just leave that out of your head. Suppose they notice. Hey, Cis. You can count on me father. Dorus? Is everything alright? Are you feeling well? What are you reading? - I got it for my birthday. That is nice. You have a fever. - I am not sick. You should be in bed. - I don't want to get sick anymore. Ciske. Go and get Mrs. Keulemans, Dorus is not feeling well. You can go to him now. Dorus? Piss off. Come on, Ciske. Soon he'll be back at the police station. - Oh what. He must be with his father's wife. What did you say? Does everyone in the neighborhood know? That Cor has something with that wash. From the Czaar Peterstraat. - Well, my clog breaks. Why else did you think he was after that divorce? If that's true. Why don't you go see it? Henry? - Go ahead, I'll take care of it. Give my child back. Mrs. Vrijmoeth? I don't want my child to associate with a woman like you. Ciske. He will come himself. Ciske. You go with your mother. And don't worry about Dorus, That will probably come on top. Just go. - You see, I'm not getting well. And from now on you will leave it alone. - Mrs. Vrijmoeth. Like everyone, Ciske needs a little love. If you don't give it to him, I'll do it. And now off. You didn't mind waiting for it, did you? I had charming company. Where's Cis? - He went to his nest. Are we going to do something fun? I set you free all night. That will be a long night. Sssst. Tomorrow you will get a delicious breakfast from me in bed. Just be careful that that sweet son of yours doesn't hear us. He doesn't notice anything. You are always so sweet to me. Take that thing off. Marie come and have a look. - What now? Damn. Were you watching your own mother? Small dirty butt. Ouch. What a stupid bitch you are, will of course tell it. Cis, he'll keep his waffle. Ouch. Stay away from me. You have nothing to say about me at all. Just let me go. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. Bye Wil, see you soon. Day Cis. Hey Hello. What is it? Let me see. How did you get that? My mother and her boyfriend. Ouch. Can't you talk to her, that is no longer possible? To talk? I let her get rid of her parental authority. How did that come about? Why did she do that? Well, uh, Ciske's father had asked him to... ... He had asked him to keep an eye on... ... who has already visited his mother. He recorded it a bit literally. You mean eh... Yes in that case, I fear I can do little. Ciske you must go to class. If you really love Ciske so much. Then please let him go. He must learn to get out with his mother. Kees, what's the name of this city? - Haarlem. Kees look again. - That is The Hague. Kees, it ends with 'dam'. Rotterdam. You don't live in Rotterdam, do you? Kees where do you live? - Czaar Peterstraat 83 two high. Mr. Maatsuyker. Bruis, can you come over? We are quiet for a moment, we take a book, we read something. And you sit down. Hey Rat, ran into a lamppost? Boys. I have very bad news. Dorus Keulemans passed away this morning. Yes? - I wanted to say something to Mrs. I think it's really bad. If you hadn't haggled about that school trip... ... he might not have gotten sick. You can't say that, Joop. I had to give you this. From Dorus. He loved you very much. Do you want to say goodbye to him? Dorus is dead. It's better if you go home now. Otherwise you get into a fight again. Cis you don't have to come anymore. That's also a coincidence. I wanted to come to you this afternoon, come in. You don't believe it, when I tell you what the little pusher has done again. Mrs Vrijmoeth, why do you not simply consent to the divorce? What do you interfere with? 'Isn't life like that for you? Always arguing. Why are you still bothered? Or don't you like it? That they marry before the child arrives. Oh Chris, you open the door, I can't do more. Forget God that you are. Get you out before I knock you out. You forget that I am Ciske's guardian. - Put that guardianship in your ass. And at your school, you won't see him anymore. If Ciske is not at school tomorrow, I go to the police. You just do it. Piss off. Well Moppie, is there anything else to come? How do I look? Hey. Potting up. Away. Where are we going? I thought you loved me. I'm not a whore, am I? It's only for once. Hey, what are you complaining about, Marie. You're not dirty about it, are you? Come on, is it so bad what I ask of you? You can earn a lot of money with it. Hey, honey. You don't get any better from it either, from all that whining. Yes wait. Well what is it? Yes or yes? Ten others for you. Stupid temeijer. Why do you always let the slab burn? Do you have to have me too? I will not let myself walk. You got in your way here. Why is it always such a mess here? Ah, man, get the skin. You sit there for Henry. To bed you. Don't you know listen to me? To bed, I said. Hurry up. - Watch out. Do not. Give me back. Give back. Chris. Marie. Marie. I'm going to get help. Aunt Jans. Aunt Jans. Aunt Jans. Cis, what's up? Cis, what's up? Maybe she's dead? It won't be that bad, is it? You can lie in my bed for so long, get warm. Then I will see what happened. He can leave. Cis. Cis. Waking. Come on, sweetheart. You have to get dressed. Your mother is dead. I do not want. Aunt Jans I'm scared. Ciske. It's time. Do you have to? Prescriptions sir. Put that newspaper away. Hey. I don't know what to say. When I'm free, can I come and live with you and aunt Jans? Of course. And I'll never leave. Come Vrijmoethje. Do not. I wish I had made it myself. - That would not have helped much. Will he ever get over it? - Nobody knows. This is the smallest size. Get well soon. - Tonus shut up. Yes sir. You will report later after dinner. - Yes sir. Detained Vrijmoeth. Cap off. Cap off. We do not like this much with knife pullers. Yes sir. I personally think that with those six months... ... quite easily come from. Yes sir. You only have to make one mistake, and I can make you a damn unpleasant stay here. Understood? - Yes sir. Mr. Vergeer. Would you like to remove this scrap from my room. Hat on. Where's your spoon? I do not know. If you lose a spoon once more, from now on you will only eat with your hands. Yes sir. Look for you. "Hey, mother murderer. - "Mother killer." 'Killer' "Murderer, Murderer, Murderer, Etc. Keep on bastards. Stop it, you bastards. Stop it, you bastards. You bastards, stop it... Asshole. What is going on here? - He suddenly started beating. His bucket fell over. Mopping up. - No. Mopping up. - No. Fisherman. Neighbor. Take over Corvee. Sir it wasn't Vrijmoeth's fault... - You shut up. We will teach you those regions. In the posture. Just leave me alone with him. I didn't think I'd find you here. - Mr. Chaplain. Ciske. Was not it? How could that happen? - I don't want to talk about it. Not with me either? You are Ciske's guardian? De Goey. Yes we do our best... ... to make it a little cozy here. Have a seat. I'm glad you could come. How is he doing? - Could be better. He clings to the idea that... He'll be living with his father and aunt soon. So you understand that I was quite shocked by your letters. I don't think the two will ever be okay. Enne. How should Ciske continue? Then he will have to find his own way. Have you talked to her? - Yes but... ... She does not want to build her future on the death of another. Shall we go and have a look? Gosh, twins. My father will be so proud. How are things really going with the class? Betje asks when you will finally come back. Certainly Mr. Maatsuyker is not allowed to stay in school anymore? Well, that's better, they know so much about you. What kind of boys are there? I have one friend. The others are constantly making fun of it. You certainly do not participate? Inside Vrijmoeth. Time is up. - Yes sir. I will greet everyone. You can be satisfied with your pupil. He is making good progress. It is already a very different boy than the cheeky, undisputed flail... ... that we received here. I want to speak to the director. I want to go to... ...House. I want to go home. I want to speak to the director. I want to speak to the director. If you don't let me go, I'll jump down. Don't put up with it, you don't have the guts. I jump. I'd rather die than stay here for another day. Frans, the director has promised you won't be punished... ... if you come down immediately. No way. Mr. Reinders for God's sake, he just wants to talk to you. I don't think about it. I don't let such a boy blackmail me. Ouch. Ouch. Nothing is forgotten? - No sir. Remember Cis. You served your sentence. It is all over now for good. Even Aunt Jans doesn't want me anymore. I'm sure she still loves you very much. I don't believe it. We don't always mean Cis. Don't you know that gradually? Vrijmoeth, the best. - Yes sir. Show that you are a guy. - Yes sir. Mr. Bruis. Come on. Hello father. - Hey, stinky. Are you coming in for a while? Why don't you go to the Crisis Committee, that's what they are for. Do you want to drink something? - No, my wife is waiting. I would never have made it without you. - We'll keep in touch. And if there is anything, just give me a call. Day Cis. And as soon as I have another school for you, I will let you know. I'll figure it out. Day. Hungry? It's not much. Until I have found a job, we have to save it. I didn't even have enough money to pick you up. Where are Theo and Corrie? In Rotterdam with your aunt. Hey, Bennie. Ciske. Cis. That's Koosje. - Bye Koosje. And that's Katrientje. - Hello, Katrientje. They have to sleep. Why don't you want to marry my father anymore? Is it because of me? No. - Do you have another man? No. It has nothing to do with you Cis. It's something between Cor and me. I think everything is so... Well, it has nothing to do with you. Can I still visit you? - Of course. Keep that dog with you. - Oh, you bastard. That dog isn't even mine. Hey. What's your name? Hup. Go home. How did it go today? - Nothing, as usual. Here gabber. - How did you get there? Walked with me. - Yes, that beast can't stay here Cis. We hardly have anything to eat ourselves. Ah, it's just a little one. He doesn't eat much. Well forward then. But you take care of it yourself. Father, have you seen the twins yet? See you later. Koosje and Katrientje. Aunt Jans said they look a lot like you. I am coming. I forgot my wallet... You shouldn't have done that Cis. - I asked him. I want you to leave. I want you both to leave. Hey guys, the Rat. - Good day, good day, Sip. Cis are you back? - Shall I walk with you? I am no longer allowed to deal with you from my parents. I don't want to see you here anymore. Get out of here. You got it there. I'll take it. Hey Rat. What do you want? Dirty mother killer. Oof. Aah. Help. I can not swim. Help. I can not anymore. Hey, stinky. Aunt Jans. Thank you Mr. Maatsuyker. There was a time when I didn't trust you. But now I am proud of you. Bravo. Mr. Maatsuyker, You forget the most important thing. And of course, you will come to our school again. Hoera. Cis, are you okay? Declare you all, wanting to fulfill all duties... ... who are bound by law to the marriage state? Yes. - Yes. Yes. - Yes. Yeah. - Yes. And now the bride and groom want to give each other the right hand. Then I declare, Civil servant of Amsterdam. In the name of the law. That you are connected by marriage. Do you want to come forward now to put your signature. I damn it. - Henrik. It won't be anything between us. - What do we get Hendrik? I don't do it, I don't feel like it. - What do you mean no more to her? The benefits but not the burdens, right? Well then you should have thought of that sooner. Druiloor. - Calm down. The moment the hammer fell, the marriage was closed to the law. And what about my signature? - If necessary, I put it myself. You just do it, I'm leaving. Let me through. Let me through. Do you want to stop this immediately? - Yes sir. Cock. Can the others also take a photo? All of them? - All of them. For Cis all in the photo. Do you want to stop there. A bit closer together please. Stand still. Stand still.
