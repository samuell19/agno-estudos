Thinking damn I wish I had their life, not knowing what shit is really like. Just because someone is always driving nice cars, wearing designer clothes and looking good every day. But it's just that, it looks good. So you think it's all good but only the person on the inside knew what it took and the bullshit one had to endure. And you on the outside never knowing how nasty shit can really get. Some of those people on the inside wish they could be on the outside with you looking in. I know because I was one of them, but I was Mitchell James' daughter so being a hustler was in my DNA. - You crazy ass bitch. - [Kathy] Really - Dave, you couldn't find no other nigga to fuck with dude? - Bitch. - [Kathy] Really? - If you bring mother fucking ass on my porch, I'm gonna fuck you up. - Bitch not your porch, Dave's bitch you could find no other nigga to mother fucking feed you. Bitch if you wanted a threesome, you could just fucking said that bitch. - Hey, Stacey. - You could've fucking said that. - bring ain't no dog up here. - (indistinct) What's wrong with you? - You gotta flat ass anyways bitch. - (indistinct) They love it and they love it and you're mad. Bye hun, walk you like a dog, authority. - Girl what could you and Stacy possibly be arguing about? - Girl she mad at me because I'm fucking with Dave, right? But like I told her, we was never friends, just neighbors. Do not be mad at your ex nigga chose me, okay? - Mm-mm, see that right there is what I'm not doing. Argue with a bitch about a nigga. Plus any man of mine would know better anyways. - Period. - And I don't know why you waste your time on that dumb ass girl. You know she saucy because she think my daddy had something to do with her daddy getting locked up. - You need to ask her ass to share anything about the rumors that somebody want to kill him. Look Sky, I don't trust that bitch. - Mm-mm, nah, she's not that stupid. And ever since my uncle went back to Cuba, my dad took over his businesses, you know I've been hearing a lot of little hating ass shit. But I let it slide, like you need to do. - Not letting shit slide. But, anyway, let's talk about that dope ass 18th birthday party you had girl. - Aah yeah. - You talk to that fine ass looking Ken yet? - No, I haven't started talking yet, and you know my parents definitely outdid themselves at that party. But I'm supposed to be talking to Ken later on when he get off work. - Okay. - You know what's crazy? Is that I never paid him any attention in school. - He was a little weird. - Hopefully a little weird. - A little weird. - But, I'm glad Juan brought his fine ass. Ah, (Sky laughing). Anyway, you figure out what to eat 'cause I'm starving? - Anywhere y'all wheels roll. I'm starving, let's hit it. You so busy dealing with steak, that I sit outside stretching looking for you. - (indistinct) - (indistinct) - You are so real, you know you asked me to go out so we going out tonight, I can't wait- - Look auntie, this is gonna be our last transaction. - I'll call you right back. What's going on now? - Look I told you I got my own spot now. I can't give you no more money. - nigga I'm the one that took care of your ass when your mom passed and if it wasn't for me, your ass to be out on the mother fucking streets. - Oh it's funny, auntie, but I ain't meet you till I was 14. How we never moved here, I probably would've never even known you. I mean you just my dad's sister, he died when I was what, 11? So who are you really? - So little nigga what you trying to say? - I'm just saying you took care of them badass kids that you ever took care of me. With my money, my checks, my shit. And you looking just fine, so here's your last thousand 'cause you dare try and be- (hand smacking) - Please get your mother fucking hands down on my face, you ain't that grown. Yeah, thank you too, little gold mouth bitch ass nigga. Fuck you thought this is? Talking about my badass kids. (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) (telephone ringing) - [Sky] Hello. - Hey is this Sky? - [Sky] Yeah, this is Sky. - This is Ken. You wasn't busy was you? - [Sky] No, I'm not busy. - Cool, cool, cool. Um, I was wondering if you wanted to go grab a bite to eat sometime. - [Sky] That would be nice. I can do it tomorrow. - Oh, tomorrow? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great. All right, I'll see you then. - [Sky] Bye. - So that was Ken. He wanted to see if we could link up later but I can't 'cause I have to see my parents off. - You did tell him tomorrow though, right? - Now you know I did. Man this is about to be the first guy I ever talked to. - Bless you, it really is. But I mean when your daddy is Mitchell James aka Killer, that'll be enough reasoning right there. You know niggas are scared of him. - I don't know about that. When I introduced Ken to my poppy at the party, he didn't seem nervous at all, which is a good thing. - Okay. - Anyway girl let me get up outta here, you know how they get. - I'll sail away girl. - I'll call you later. - All right girl call me. - All right. (car door slams) (car engine revving) - Mommy, are you sure you don't want me to go to Cuba with you and Poppy? I mean I wanna meet dad's other side of the family too. - Not this time baby girl.

I just need my favorite accountant to make sure my books are good while I'm gone. You're are gonna be an accountant, right, right? - See Poppy, but I wanna be a lawyer like mom. I mean Carla and I are gonna open up our own law firm and everything. - So be both. - Yeah, so be both. But just make sure you're an accountant first, mm-hmm? I didn't teach you how to be good with numbers for no reason. - Whatever you choose to do, mija, just be the best at it, okay? - (speaking foreign language) Hey (speaking in foreign language). - Now here's a debit card, use it wisely.

Man, shut your ass up. - And when you ain't doing that, what you doing at your momma house? Being a dick supporting her and only fans. Come on bro, stop me dog. You feel me? - You know I get my nothing. Look up. - (indistinct) - (indistinct) - This shit I got in the store (indistinct) mine have us all eat a long ass time. - Y'all can do with that shit. - Promise I'm with God though. - Hey run that up. - Mommy, Poppy, gonna miss you guys.

Hey and let me know if y'all need anything, okay? Hey. - Yeah. - I need you to go check over and make sure (indistinct) (upbeat music) - Hmm.

(hands knocking on wood) Miami, ain't that where all the young people go? - I guess Sky, but your ass say anywhere and you chose Miami? We about to be like the rest of these ghetto bitches. This is only like it's RV day, and Thought City Miami. - Come on it won't take us on to get there and I'm sure you will have us a ball in Thought City Miami. - Look whatever, anyway, you talked to Ken? - I did, and. - Mm-hmm. - We were texting before I got here and we're linking up and going out to eat later when I leave. - Please tell me everything, I need to know what he's about because I mean shit, he ain't talking much in school, think that a little weird. - Right? Maybe that's why I never paid him any attention in school. But you already know I'm gonna tell you everything that happens. - Please do. - For now, let me just make sure these books are straight. (background traffic and hooting) - (Sky indistinct) I'm gonna call you later. - Don't forget you better call me girl. - Don't forget you better call me girl. ♪ It's heavenly something like a melody ♪ ♪ Time keeps on slowing down (gentle music) (gentle music continues) - So, I had a taste for Chinese food and this is my favorite restaurant. - Okay. - But unfortunately they don't have a good dining experience so I figured we could just order it and have it here. - Baby, I'm just happy you called me. - Um, you know what's crazy? - What? - We never talked in school and I never knew that you and Juan were friends until I seen y'all at the mall that day. - Yeah, he cool. The whole time I always had my eyes on you, even though everybody would tell me how crazy your pops is, baby, I ain't scared. - Okay, first of all, my daddy is not crazy, he just don't take no shit. - I understand. - But um, tell me more about you. - Well I moved up here when I was 13, from Ohio. It was me and my mama, She got a new job at the Ford plant, thinking you know we make a better life for ourselves and everything. Two weeks later my little brother and my uncle, killed. - Oh, I wasn't expecting that. I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry. - Well um, if you don't mind me asking, how did they pass, and what about your dad? - Nah, I don't mind at all, um. My brother and my uncle bodies was never found. But what would make you never return to your family other than death, right? My mama basically died from a heart attack, she was heartbroken. Pills and alcohol killed her. And my dad, he was just a street nigga, so that street shit killed him, you know how that go. - Well at least you seem to be holding up okay. - I mean, yeah, I got to stay with my auntie until I graduated and then I was able to get this trust fund my mama left for me and I went straight. But you, you don't seen there no problems living in this big ass house? - Yeah, I mean I am a lot more fortunate than others my age, but that's only because of my parents. - When they coming back in here? - I don't know, but um, when is our next date gonna be? I know this probably seems pretty lame. - Lame? Lame? Baby ain't nothing about this lame. Mija, it can be whenever you want it to be. Whenever you want it to be.

Well wait uncle Don, if you're here then where are my parents? I thought they were in Cuba with you. - That's why I'm here, let's have a seat. - What's going on uncle Don? Where are my parents? - Well you know, your parents weren't involved in a really bad car accident. - What? - By the time the paramedics arrived, the car burst into flames and they got stuck in. (dramatic music) - Hell, no. So you're telling me my parents are dead? No, please tell me that's not what you're saying right now. Uncle Don, please tell me that's not what you're saying.

He never mentioned that. - It's never really a reason for him to mention that to you. But the real money came from our clientele base, it's just the rappers, athletes, politicians. - So y'all pimped? - Girl, ain't nobody no damn pimps. - Definitely not pimps. And these women are not prostitutes. I like to call 'em working professionals. - Working professionals, prostitutes. - So your mom and Jackie find a way to turn this into a very lucrative business and our clients still need us. Jackie will assist you with the rest. (dramatic music) - I mean, I don't know about this. Do you think Carla and I can really handle all of this? - Did you forget where you came from? Little James I know we need help, never forget that. I'm gonna stick around for a little while, to make sure you damn runs smooth. Aunt Jackie, take care of the rest. - Don't worry girls, I'm gonna make sure you two run things just as well as Stanley did (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) - Are they really fucking serious? They do know that we're only 18, right? I mean, who's gonna listen to us? - For the fake IDs that your uncle- - Fuck those IDs. What about college? (dramatic music continues) What about my life? This is not what I had planned. - Listen, first of all, you need to loosen up. You're so uptight about everything, it's going to be okay, literally, we've been through worse shit than this. Now pull yourself together. We got shit to do. - Right. I'm Mitchell James's daughter. (dramatic music continues) But mentally Car, I'm just not ready. - Girl, as long as you got me you're good and you got me forever. Now, I think you need to come to this listener party that these Detroit rapper just having, it might help ease your my and loosen your ass up. - Fine, anything's better than listening to this shit. - Beau, now let's go find something sexy to wear, 'cause you know the fine ass is gonna be in the building, let's go. ♪ Yeah baby how you just pass me without letting me just ♪ ♪ Squeeze up on the mass sheets fuck pass beats autumn ♪ ♪ House last week they been chasing me but you're ♪ - You had to get your lame ass get out the house. - I mean, yeah, I guess it's a vibe in here. - Girl, it's fucking slapping in here.

(upbeat music) And I mean, I don't know, I'm just not ready for that. I know I'm doing a lot of things at my age that someone would normally be doing, but living with a man, I just don't see it, I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry. - I do love you though. - I love you too my love.

But what is he doing here? I thought we were having a meeting. - We're having a meeting. He's the video director. - What's up Sky? Look, I know in all of our conversations we never talked about our profession, but when Carla mentioned your name, I knew it was you. - No, we never talked about that. And it's me. So um, come down to business. - Well I'll leave y'all to it. (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) Look at you, you already working, thanks. - Um, I could say the same for you. - So why you stopped returning my calls? I was hoping to see you again after your first visit. - I told you I started talking to somebody and it became serious, so that's why I stopped calling. - So me being here is making you uncomfortable? - You don't think you're moving too close? - Not at all, you ain't have no problem with it the first time I kissed you. - Um Mark, Mark what are you doing? (upbeat music) (upbeat music continues) (upbeat music continues) - Aah, look, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, nice. - Baby can I come down to the club with you tonight? - Not tonight.

Stacey, I'll call you. - Okay? - Mm-hmm. (Ken sighing) (dramatic music) (electronic beeps) (phone ringing) - Hello Ken? - Hey babe. - Why haven't you been answering my calls? I was worried about you. - It was, I was at the club being disrespectful to the girls last night, (Stacey laughing) and I had to, I had to handle that. But it is everything good now. - Who is that? - Who's what? - Thought I heard somebody's voice in the background. - You just go ahead and get yourself together. - I will baby. I love you. - Bye. (dramatic music) (phone thuds on table) (dramatic music continues) Nah, he wouldn't do that to me. (dramatic music continues) - Keep your voice down, huh? Hmm? You think that Carla whipped your ass, bitch, I will kill you. (Ken laughing) Go dry your fucking face off. (dramatic music) (Stacey crying) (dramatic music continues) (Sky humming) (door creaking) - Hey girl. - Hey. (door slams) - What's up? You gimme some? - No ma'am, and I'm sure your greedy ass party ate anyway. - Twice. - Oh, (indistinct). - Anyway, what's up? - Um. Before we get down to business, I need to clear my mind of a few things. Nothing about you. - All right, what's up? - So remember when I went to California, I never told you that I slept with Mark. - You never said anything but I kind of just put it together, you came back all glowy and shit. Why did he do something? - Nothing. I mean nothing like that. Remember when we first started talking, Ken and I weren't serious so it didn't matter. But since he's been in town, he's been pressing me. And yesterday we had sex, then I had to go home. I had sex with Ken too. (Carla coughing) - Which I felt like a whole whore. - Skylar James, now that's fucked up. Ain't no way girl. You should have said it was on your period, you wasn't in the mood, something. 'Cause there ain't no way, I'm fucking two niggas in one night. And I pray you didn't have to give them both head because I know your jaws is tired, girl. (Carla laughing) - Whatever. - What are you gonna do about Mark? - I don't know. I mean I like Mark. He's the total opposite of Ken, more professional, just like a grown man, I mean you get it? But I am in love with Ken though. - Woo. - But I'm attracted to Mark. - Since it sound like you got some decisions to make, there's nothing wrong with exploring your options. I mean, hell, Ken has been your only boyfriend. You've got some decisions to make, but it's one that I can't make for you. - Yeah, I feel you. But anyways, I have to meet up with Mark again to finish the video, but I really don't wanna go. Can you please, please, please go? I gotta flight to catch in two hours. Did you forget we have business in Chicago? - Yes, I forgot. Tell old faithful Tim I say hello. - Will do, oh, don't worry about coming to get me, Dave is gonna come pick me up. - Dave, that took my best friend. - Sky, look, we locked in forever, okay? (dramatic music) - Okay. - Ti amo, besty. - Ti amo, besty. (shoes clanking on floor) - Thank you for always being there for me. - No problem, I got you forever, okay? - Okay. - Now fix your face. Put a smile on it, there you go. I wanna see you tomorrow. - You act like you not gonna see me again or something, girl. - Cheer up. See you later. - See you. (dramatic music) Hmm, it's not even good. (dramatic music) (cutlery clanging) - [Waitron] Would you guys like anything else? - No, thank you. - [Waitron] Enjoy it. - So what you see in this dude? - That's none of your business? - I mean, I'm just saying he don't look like he could do what I can do for you. Damn sure don't look like he can take care of you the way I do, I mean he just look like some old street nigga, don't even seem like your type. I mean I could be wrong but that just what I see. - First off, I make and have my own money and I don't need a man to take care of me. And so what if he is a nigga from the streets? He's mine, and I'm gonna stick beside him. Know, I should've went home. - Hey, listen, listen, listen. I just knew I wanted you from the first time I saw you. You can't tell me that connection wasn't real. I mean, you left California and I just knew you would come back. - Sorry I didn't come back. - Yeah, me too. You mind following me to the rental spot and take me back to my hotel? - Yeah, I can do that. - Let's go.

Least you can rely more on Rob. I also considered talking to Ken about the flip side of the business. - I don't think that's a good idea uncle Don. I mean, I just feel like giving him all of that power will make me forever connected to him. - Well if you wanna stay in this business, you gotta find somebody other than yourself that you can trust. I won't be around too much longer. I gotta go back to Cuba. Think about it, if you wanna keep this thing going, I trust you can do that. - Yeah, I definitely can do that.

(hand smacking) Look first, let me apologize to you Sky, by having you believe your mother and I were deceased and putting you through hell. We knew a few weeks before leaving someone was after my head. Now we thought about taking you with us but didn't want you to have to leave this life you had here. So we figured if we faked our deaths you'd be okay. And your uncle Don would've made sure that. And we knew the person was related to one of the dudes we did business with. But it wasn't until now that we knew who, if I would've seen this coming, I would've listened to your mother let go all this shit and took you with us. - Do you have any idea what this bitch put me through? How could you have possibly thought that any of this would be okay? I don't know whether to hate you or to love you at this point. I coulda still had my best friend. Oh, that's right, y'all don't know. You wanna tell them Stacey? - What would Stacey have to do with anything. - That's the same shit I wanna know. - This bitch and this nigga Ken, killed Carla. Yeah, she was ready to snitch on his ass too. That's why she was locked up in that room with me, but she wasn't there long enough to get pimped out like I did. - The fuck you mean? (hand smacking) You tricking my daughter mother fucker? - Bro, whoa, whoa, whoa chill out, chill. - Get the fuck off me. - Bro, hey he said the (indistinct) for that man, chill out. - Stop. Please let me be the one to deal with him. I told you I was pregnant, but you didn't believe me. And I know you looked in the trash too so I know you know that it's true. You don't even deserve to breathe. (hand smacking) (dramatic music continues) - I'm sorry we all have to be here under these circumstances, as you know, this is not the outcome I had intended. - You damn right about that. Not can't believe y'all had me believing my best friend was dead. She mustn't give a fuck about my child's funeral or the friendship. And to think, y'all didn't trust me enough to let me know what was going on, me. I am pissed (speaking in foreign language) - (speaking in foreign language), okay? Now she'll be back when all this fucking shit is over. It was best for everybody, Jackie. - Yeah, if you say so, Mitchell. I just need to see the bitch that kill my baby. That is it. That is all. - She's in the basement locked up with Ken. - Hey, maybe we should get the mother fuckers some water or something - (speaking in foreign language) You of all people should know stray dogs don't get fed. And Nico, what do you plan to do with Rob's body? - I'm have him cremated , and then I'm gonna take him home with me. - Okay, just let me know if there's anything else you need. - Look, I'm just ready to get this shit over with. (speaking in foreign language), Nico. - See him (speaking foreign language) - Wait, wait, wait, what are you talking about? - Mitch, I got this. Okay now Sky here, asked me for a personal favor and being that that's the mother fucker responsible for me not having a brother right now, I'm gonna have fun filling her request. - And I am too, we have everything we need. - But first, let Nico and I take care of Ken. - Sky, you sure about that? - Just as sure as when you left me for a year. - (speaking I foreign language) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (Stacey crying) (Stacey crying continues) - Don't worry bitch, we're not here for you, shut the fuck up. We're here for this pretty little nigga right here, who lost all power he thought he had, look at me. Now even get to feel the pain that I felt. Oh, and don't worry, this baby will never know you, stupid ass. Don't be gentle. (dramatic music continues) - Ah hell no, you fucking kidding me. You're not putting that shit in my mouth - Shut the fuck up. (gunshot firing) (Ken screaming) (dramatic music continues) - Is he still breathing? - Barely, but still just enough life in him for you to take away. - Good, now he can watch exactly what auntie Jackie is about to do to Stacey. (dramatic music continues) You ready auntie Jackie? - Hell yeah. - You mind if I come with you? - You can, but I'm not sure if you ready for this. - I'm more ready than you know. - Well let's go. (dramatic music continues) (Stacey crying) So Stacey, you and this little stupid mother fucker here responsible for taking my daughter Jackie out? - I'm so sorry, please forgive me, I'm sorry. - Tell that shit to the Lord when you go and see Him. - Sorry Jackie, I'm so sorry, please. (Stacey crying) - You should have really done your research. Yeah, research would've told you, you were with the wrong familia baby girl.

(baby cooing) Dumb decision, bye. But I do understand. - Yeah, definitely one of the dumbest decisions I could have ever made. - I mean, but the best thing to come out of this, is Storm. - Yeah, my granddaughter for sure is something special. - [Sky] Yeah, she should be asleep soon. - Yeah, I'm sure the car ride wore her out. But I think it's time for us to go Papa, I mean I think we should leave. - Wait, no, I thought your flight didn't leave until the morning. - It doesn't, but (speaking foreign language) Papa, we're gonna go stay at a hotel. You got a new baby, you got a new family, you got a new house, mija, enjoy it. - I mean Mommy, Poppy you could have stayed a little longer. - No, your mother's right, we stayed long enough.
