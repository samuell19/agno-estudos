Konka my name. We booked a room here. Suitcases in the room. I'm busy. Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen, live from Anröchte. Here, on Sunday afternoon, a horrible massacre took place. 15 people were brutally beheaded. The murderers are nowhere to be found. Witnesses are talking about Huns on horses. A cellphone video that we've received confirms that. Terror in Anröchte. The head of Erwin Maier is still nowhere to be found. The police is waiting for hints. They're looking for men on horses. Please do not leave the house except for necessary reasons as buying food. Where is this little bastard? One moment please! I'm still in a meeting! You son of a bitch! You're so stupid! Bedbugs! Stupid! Shit! Get out of here! Get the fuck out! So. Please come into my office. So you are the inspector. Nice here, isn't it? Mr. Mayor, I'm here because of the massacre. It's my job to clarify the case ASAP and for that I need full support from your municipality, mayor. There was no massacre. Listen I've been doing this job for a few years now and I know that a few days ago... Nothing happened here. I don't know what you mean. Inspector. Let me put it another way We live from tourism here. And I have to tell you that, also for this reason, there was no massacre here. Believe me, we have reliable information that the massacre was an act of organized crime! I don't know what you're talking about! So? So you didn't notice anything? Do you now remember what has happened here? A massacre! A massacre took place here! Thank you. In a creation that no longer holds us in its arms, man is not a helper or friend, but a wolf. Where does this hatred come... The case won't be easy, Walter! It's sticky... Hmm.. What else do we have? And... Now we are going to... Walter! Listen, I will do some questioning today. I would be happy if you could take a look around. Inconspicuous! We are dealing with organized crime, if my instincts do not deceive me! Can you make a statement about one of the victims of the massacre? Did you notice anything? You must know, I don't know how to deal with what happened. How should one deal with such a terrible act? Mrs. Diensen, she used to live in our neighborhood. Did you notice anything about Ms. Diensen lately? Is there anything you can tell me? In fact... Those young people... Let me tell you... At night... It's frightening. Things are happening. Let me tell you, really. Frightening. Young people? Yes. Sorry. Young people... Outside... We're just smoke carried away by the wind. We have never been promised a country, we are just here for a moment. And yet wolves among wolves. We walk along a narrow line that is nothing but a point in time, so tiny it doesn't even seem to be there anymore. What are we in this unimaginable vastness? A disappearance of nothing in nothing. Is there no way out? Is this heart that we carry just a bloody piece of flesh? Can't we hold each other's hands for one moment, that one moment that we're waiting here before fading away? Our interrogations showed that strange things are going on here, that nobody knows about. It is important that you keep your eyes open and notify us as soon as you notice something. If you even notice something yourself... I expect you to cooperate successfully. Do they think they are better than us just because they're from the city!? Let's have a look at those little fuckers. No brake. No clutch, just a gas pedal and let's go! Today is the day! Horny guys hot brides. Friends! That was the first round. Now time for the second round! There's also a third round... You want more? You want more? You haven't had enough yet? All right, then let's move up to the 5th! Hot! Hot! Hot! That's hoooooot! Let's go! Go! Go! Hooooooooooooooot...! Konka, criminal investigation department. You are all arrested - You are all arrested for drugs! Oh no... It's a success, Walter. But the case is by no means solved! You stay here and me, I'm going to bed. Take them away. Walter. Do you know what's the problem? The problem is there is no motive! The case is so difficult because there is no motive! The deed appears completely pointless! That's why we don't understand it. Do you understand? The murder makes no sense. And that's why it's so cruel! No motive! Ergo No sense! How can we understand this murder? We have to realize its pointlessness! I ordered a cab. We're going straight to the forensic center in Dortmund. They have the first results. Let's see what they have to say... We found out all of the victims, all!, were possibly killed in the same way. We believe with great certainty that we can exlude natural cause of death. Most likely it is a deliberate killing. It would be conceivable that they were beheaded by a possibly metallic object. Something like a hedge trimmers... or a steel frisbee with a sharpened edge. We cannot, however, provide more details. Can you give details of the time of death? Yes. About four to eight days ago. So it fits to the timing of the massacre? Yes, you can say that with a lot of certainty. And... How are your investigation going? They are coming along. We have a lot to do. We have to go back to Anröchte soon. It's going quite well. There is still a lot to be done. That's the way it is. Walter, do you know whales? You know these huge fish that swim in the sea! They have a hole up there, you know? To breathe. I have seen some by the sea. They are huge. But you never see them completely. One sees only now and then the caudal fin or the hole. It is the same here. The whale is there, but we don't see him. We only have the ability to catch him if the tail or the hole is peeping out. But that's just a metaphor. There is no sea here and there are no whales. Yes, no... yes... I'll tell you... Yes. Sure. Mommy... I gotta go... Yeah... You know... Business... No. No, it's not dangerous. No. Really not. Mommy... Trust me. Yes, it's ok, mum, I must go. Yes, really! I must go! Yes. That's right. Alright then. Love you too... I love you too. Bye. Mum, I told you... Sorry. Yes? Who? Yes. Yes, OK... We're coming, yes. The district of Anröchte. They've arrested a suspect. We should come immediately... And you say you... shot... these people just for fun, Mr... Breitspieß? Mr. Breitspieß, how many people did you... 'shoot'? To all of those who were killed! The suspect confirmed this earlier. We probably forgot to put that in the log... And where did you dispose the weapon, Mr. Breitspieß? The suspect stated that he had thrown the weapon in a deep well, that was filled by the city administration for landscape gardening reasons... Could I have a word with you privately? Let me tell you something I cannot stand those people anymore than you can! But... there is a certain professionalism required in our profession, rules, that we have to follow. And one more thing you can make someone else the but of your joke but not me! I am inspector Konka! Am I clear!? I've been at this job for too long to be mocked by anybody! Are we clear? Walter! Assholes! Stupid assholes! Stupid bitch! Bitch! They cannot fool me! Those bitches! Chief Inspector... are you OK? OK? OK? Yes, everything is OK! Leave me alone! I want to be alone! I am Konka! Konka I am! I'm not any old idiot! I am Konka! I won't let them fool me. I just got a promotion... Yes. OK. Good. They found something outside of Anröchte. One of them will pick us up and drive us there. We were on patrol here coincidentally this morning when we made this cruel discovery. Evidence suggests that this poor person is also a victim of the murderers that were responsible for the massacre! Is blood only in our veins to be shed? Are we only the helpers of evil, the henchmen of death? We look someone in the eye, but find only contempt... and someone else finds only contempt in our eyes. Can no grace come into what we do? Can no... Isn't there a little light in our hearts that can light up this dark garden a little? Can there be no joy in what we do? Can there be no love in what we do...? Hey, you! Asshole! Fuck off! Fuck off! I know how much you suffer, Walter. It's the world, isn't it? It's the world you suffer from, right? I can understand that well, Walter. I understand you, Walter. Come on. I have to show you something. Hello, my sweethearts! This is Walter. He wanted to visit us. Be so nice and say hello to Walter! Hello Walter. Walter is a little sad. Let him play with you a little while, okay? No! No! This is not the world! There is another world! Does it really exist Walter? Are you sure? Are you sure it really exists Walter? There's another world in our hearts! Are you sure? Does it really exist Walter? Walter. The solution occurred to me. Which solution? The solution to the case. You know the solution? We were trying to make connections to understand the murder. Connections that lead to the murderers. But there can't be any connections! Evil happens pointless and out of the blue. And that's why there can't be any connections around it. It's very simple... it's too simple, basically! When Evil happens pointless and out of the blue, then good also happens pointless and out of the blue! We just have to find the murderer! Yes, don't even have to search we have to find him out of the blue and arrest him! Walter! We'll find the murderer now! You don't mind if I sit down here? No no, I don't mind, no no, I don't mind! Please! That's very nice of you. You're welcome! Have a seat! I just hope... I hope that... Yes? No, nothing! Nothing! - No? - No! No! Nothing... I just hope... you won't mistake me for someone who I am not! So... It could be that you mistake me for someone! Who could I mistake you for? For nobody! Aha... No no, for nobody! For nobody... for nobody that has anything to do with the massacre! Why should I have something to do with the massacre!? I look like someone who has something to do with the massacre - but it's not me! I... I... I have a twin brother, you must know! He looks just like me! We were separated after birth! It was him! It was him! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! I swear that it wasn't me! It couldn't have been me because it was my twin brother! It couldn't have been me! You can't fool me. I am Konka. No! Where does this hatred come from? My method is basically very simple find, not search! So I came here and he fell in the trap. Where does the evil come from that leads man to lie and deceive, rape and murder his neighbor? Where does all this hatred come from? Where does all this hatred come from? Huh? Tell me! Where does all this hatred come from? Huh? Where does all this hatred come from? Why can't we live in peace? What is just wrong with this world? Look at me! What is just wrong with this world? Why? Why? The investigation is finally over. In a spectacular chase, the inspector Konka convicted the murderer who was responsible for the massacre. The existence of accomplices has not been confirmed. The state of emergency is lifted. Shops are open again. You can now leave your apartments to go shopping. And now, the weather report... Edition of the subtitling François Minaudier
