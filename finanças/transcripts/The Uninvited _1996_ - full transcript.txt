(bell ringing) (ominous music continues) (Charlotte laughing) (thunder rumbling) Daniel, come here. We've got a go before Papa comes home. (water running) (thunder rumbling) (ominous music continues) Daniel? Daniel. Come on, we've gotta go now. Papa's coming. Daniel? (Mrs. Parrish gasps) Callum. (water running) (thunder rumbles) (Mrs. Parrish screams) (gun bangs) - Mamma! Mamma! (wood creaking) (soft tense music) (gentle pleasant music) (upbeat country music) ♪ Officer hot and sweaty ♪ - Hey, pretty lady! You're looking pretty good there. Why don't you ditch those two funny looking kids and come up here and ride with a real man? - Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? - No one else on the road, honey. - Well, Mister, if these kids are funny looking, it's your fault! - Come on, Dad, honk! - Yeah, honk! (truck horn honking) - [Molly] All right, Dad! - Honk back, Mom. - Okay. (car horn honks) (truck horn honking) (bird squawks) - Mom? - Yeah? - I gotta go pee. (Pattie sighs) - [Pattie] Molly, I'm gonna stop giving you anything to drink. (bright pleasant music) (dog barking) (lawn mower rumbling) - [Molly] Are we there yet? - Yep, honey, we are here. That one right there. - That one? - Whoa. - Huh? - That's so cool. - What do you think, guys? It's our new house. - Mom, I gotta pee. I really gotta pee. - [Johnathan] I'll race ya! - [Molly] No way! I win! (bright pleasant music) (Charles imitates trumpet blaring) - Look what I got. - Firecracker! - Oh, Charles! You're so bad! (Charles laughing) - And they're legal out here. - Woo! - All right, couldn't do this in the apartment. - Yeah but out here, nobody can complain because it's all ours! (Molly screaming) - Careful! - And it's all brand new! - And no one on the other side of the wall. - And nobody over our head! - No traffic, no crime, no landlord! - [All] Can you keep the noise down? - I get my own room! - All right then, let's light one for the Mollster! (all screaming) (fireworks crackling) - They are finally asleep. - My weights. I thought I lost these. - You've had that box in the garage all these years. Are you trying to impress me? Are you trying to impress me? - There's no one else in the room, darling. Oh, baby. - Did you see all those minivans when we drove through? - Mm-hmm. - And we come here in this land yacht. - You got down on your knees and you begged for that convertible. - That worked, didn't it? - Mm-hmm. - The last thing we can afford is a new car. Listen. - Hmm? - It's so quiet. (bird squawking) - Did we have to bring him? - I forgot to feed him. - Can't we just set him loose or something? - [Pattie] It's not good to hold a grudge. - Those things live to be a hundred years old. He could outlive me. - A woman needs a companion in her old age. - Hey. Old age indeed. (soft music) - There you go. (bird squawks) (lips smack) It's okay. - Huh? I'm finding some stuff I didn't know was in there. - This is one your mother made, isn't it? - Uh-huh. - God, look at the work she put into this. (soft music continues) Why, he'd be six months old now. Sitting up and talking and crawling around. - Hey, don't, don't, don't. - What are you gonna do with it? Charlie? - It's an old Hopi Indian belief that children who die are born again in the next baby and they keep something from the child in their home to keep the spirit from wandering. There. So he won't wander too far. (soft music continues) (children laughing) - [Child] Wait up! - I don't know how in the world you've ever had all these toys in your own room. It's ridiculous. But, you know, the good thing about this house is it's so big, there's a whole closet just for toys. See? You're done with something, you throw it in just like that. There you go, that's right, yeah. There you got it. The stegosaurus Rex is in. Hopper is in. Bunny one and bunny two in, there you go. Waldo is in. This was gonna be your little baby brother's. (soft music) I bet he'd want you to have it. Okay, tell you what. With these new toys, I'll put 'em up on the shelf. Keep 'em there for you until you're ready. Just let me know. (Pattie sighs) (Johnathan chuckles) What? What's so funny? - [Johnathan] The lion's sleepy. - Oh, indeed he is. Well, he's been sleeping in that box for a long time. You gotta wake up now. Hop to it. Wake up. Stay there. Oh, I think we're about done here. I'm hungry. You ready for lunch? - Yeah. - Yeah. So what's the first thing we gotta do? - Wash our hands. - Okay. There you go. Well, I guess I'm gonna have to go call your dad. (soft tense music) (Johnathan groans) Oh, what in the (gasps). Oh, no, Jonathan, do not touch that. No. Oh, gosh. Ugh. This is your puzzle, isn't it, Molly? What's that? - Well, up here's heaven and the baby's going up to heaven on the rainbow. - That's beautiful. - I put glitter on the rainbow. I used my special glue. - Come on. Yeah. Oh, that looks real good. Molly, would you do me a favor? Don't grow up. Just stay nine for another year, okay? - [Charles] Pattie! Got a problem here. (Charles grunts) - Oh, oh, oh. - Look at this. I can't figure out where the water is coming from. I mean, there's no pipes in this part of the wall. (Charles grunts) Guess we'll just have to talk to the builder on this one. (wind chime chiming) (child laughing in distance) (soft eerie music) (child laughing in distance continues) (gentle chiming music) - Well how'd you get in here? (Pattie yelps) (soft tense music) (children laughing) - [Molly] Hey, wait for me. - Pattie, Pat! It's all under control. I'm ahead of schedule. Just finished the flower box. What do you think, huh? You can plant anything you want. Roses. I got sprinkler systems all set to go. And right in here, this is the best part, all new, beautiful green sod. All right. A few more trees out here and right here a big honking barbecue. We can have the neighbors over, sweetie. Look, we can go out there and pick lemons from our own backyard. Get the kids making lemonade. This is the life, huh? - You're damn right it is. (Charles laughs) (children laughing) - [Johnathan] Where you going, Dad? - Off to Shaky Town. - [Molly] That's LA, right? - You got it. - What if there's an earthquake? - No problem, Moll. Cab starts shaking, I haul my butt back here and wait for the next flood. - None for him? - (sighs) I don't think so. Love you. If you need me, just beep, all right? Bye-bye, Mol. - Bye, Daddy. - Bye, Johnathan. - Love you! - Bye. (soft eerie music) - Jonathan? Jonathan, you are supposed to be in bed. What are you looking at? - It's a boy. (child laughing in distance) - What is that? Where's that flashlight? (soft mystical music) Don't be scared. No, no, don't, don't touch it. (soft mystical music continues) - [Molly] Mom! - Yeah, Molly, what is it? - [Molly] I can't find my nail polish. - Gone. - Yeah, it's gone. Night, honey.

(water running) (ominous music) (faucet squeaks) (water burbling) (dramatic suspenseful music) (soft tense music) (wind chime chiming) (police radio chattering) - You sure you locked it? - Yes, I'm certain. I know I did because I checked it right before I went to bed. I always do when my husband's away. (bird squawks) - What was that? - My bird Tennessee and that's not what I heard. - Excuse me. I live next door. Stan Cornelson. Is there anything I can do? - Oh, hi, I'm Patricia Johnson. Nice to meet you. - My pleasure. - Well, I heard something and that's why... Did you hear anything? (phone ringing) Oh, sorry, sorry. Charlie. Yeah. Hi. Don't get worried. - You the neighbor? - Yes. I was up working on my computer at home. Didn't hear a thing. This is usually a pretty quiet neighborhood. I mean, none of the neighbors seem to have any problems. - Okay. Okay. Yes, all right. Officer, my husband wants to talk to you. - Hello. - How's it look there, officer? - Nothing much to see. No sign of an intruder or forced entry. The neighbor was up, didn't hear anything. (bird squawks) - My wife said she heard someone in the house. - [Officer] Maybe it was the bird. Makes a hell of a noise. - No kidding. Could you please get her back on? - Ma'am? - Thanks. Hey. - You want me home? - No. No. I took a bath. Maybe I left the tub running, I don't know. You know, I use the kids' bathroom 'cause they're the only ones that have tub. So, I don't know. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure. You're coming home tomorrow, right? - [Charles] Yeah. - Okay. I love you. I'll talk to you later. Bye. - Bye. (truck rumbling) (Pattie screams) (Charles laughs) - Woo! Oh, help me get my weary ass inside. - What took you so long? (wind chime chiming) - I got this new cheese. It's got garlic and herbs in it. Gourmet section. - Yeah. - It's adult cheese with these fancy crackers. - The salad looks good, huh? - [Pattie] Yeah. - The butcher sold me this mesquite stuff to throw on the barbie. He said people like that around here. - Mesquite, mesquite? Mosquito. Hey, did you see the lemons that Molly got from the trees? - Yeah. Yeah, they're great. - [Pattie] Are there enough of them out there? - [Charles] Yeah, look good. I think that we need to- (both grunt) - [Pattie] Oh, Charlie. - (laughs) Sorry, okay. Okay, now then, it's all right, it's all right. - Call these people, tell them to stay home. We're not ready to do this. - Well sure, we're ready. Look how nice the yard looks. We're gonna have the neighbors over, get to know 'em. We're gonna have a few laughs. It's gonna be great. ♪ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♪ - Pattie, welcome wagon. We have a little something for you. (neighbors chattering) (Stan clears throat) - So Stan, I hear you're into computers. - That's right. - I hauled a load of computers once. Yeah. (neighbors chattering) - [Neighbor] Did you see that statue in the house? - [Neighbor 2] I did. - Ta-da! - Don't you love it? - Oh, that's so thoughtful of you. Thank you. - Do you know what it is? - It's a juicer, right? - Well, it's a lemon juicer. A must have a around here. - Did you, did you guys catch that wrestling match last night? The Ultimate Warrior versus the Undertaker? I love the Undertaker's manager, Paul Bearer. (Charles laughs) Paul Bearer. You know, Paul bearer. - I heard that you had the police up here the other night. Is that true? - Oh, yeah. It was nothing really. I just thought I heard something. - Better safe than sorry, you know. - [Neighbor] You bet. - Yeah, that's what I thought, so. Have you heard anything odd at night here? - Oh, just Bruce's snoring. That's real loud. (all laughing) (Halley snoring) - Yeah, well, a new house and everything. I felt pretty silly actually. (children laughing) Molly, keeping an eye on John, okay? - Okay, Mom! - So Bruce, you look like you might have played a little football in your day. - Nope. Never did. - Baseball? - Nope. - Golf? What? What do you guys do around here? - We got a lake. - Oh, yeah? - One hour north. - Bass. - Oh, now you're cooking. Now you're talking. I caught one once, eight and a half pounds. Had a mouth big enough to get your whole hand right down inside there. He swallowed the whole hook. I had to jerk it out. Practically tore my hand off with his teeth. - Bass don't have teeth. - Oh, well then maybe he just gummed me to death. (all laughing) - But the baby didn't make it. Well, I guess that's why I'm so protective of the kids. - Mm. That's terrible. - How far along were you? - Seven months. I just went into labor all of a sudden. The doctor knew the baby was dead, but I had to deliver him anyway. - Oh, that's gotta be the worst pain there is. - Yeah, I kinda lost it for a while. I couldn't really function, not like normal. I couldn't even take care of the kids. I guess I had a breakdown of some kind. Now I'm all right now, but I guess it never really goes away. - I light a candle every Sunday for the child I lost. In my mind, I don't, I don't have two children. I have three. Nothing could ever replace her. - You ever get the feeling that your child's still out there somewhere? - Oh, all the time. I mean, I was convinced that when she was born, they switched her on me and that I was never gonna get to see her grow up. It was like this, this sort of cosmic joke. (children laughing in distance) - Didn't you bring chocolate ice cream? And you were so full of it. I got a whole, so much fish I could beat an entire Boy Scout troop. - You calling me a liar? - No, it's not that all fisherman lie. It's just that all liars fish. - That's my line. - Liar. (wind chime chiming) (suspenseful music) (Pattie gasps) (child laughing in distance) (soft mystical music) (Pattie chuckling) - Did I hear something about the carpool? - Yeah. They asked me to join. And you don't say the carpool. It's just carpool. - The guys invited me to go bowling with them. - You don't bowl. - I hate bowling. Didn't your mom leave us her old bowling ball? It was in that nice leather bag. I don't think we ever took it out. That stuff is so expensive to rent. Are we in suburban heaven or what? We're gonna be just fine here. - Yeah. The ladies are so nice. - Good, I want you to have people around when I'm on the road. - Halley lost a baby too. Charlie, something just happened upstairs in the bathroom. - Oh, I'm sorry about the wall. You know, they keep telling me they're gonna come by. I don't know (laughs)- - No, that's not what I'm talking about. I saw something. - Huh? - In the, in the mirror. It's pretty weird, I know, but- - [Charles] What? What? - It's gonna sound crazy. - Pattie. - Okay. I was washing my hands and I looked up in the mirror and my hair was flying up like this. - So use rollers. - No, you're not hearing what I'm telling you. I felt something. I've been feeling things. And the other night I heard this child's voice. There's something else too. I haven't told you about it. - Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean you heard a child? (gentle music) - At night, I've heard things around here. - Yeah, because, you know what, you're used to the sound of traffic drowning everything else out. - You think? - Sure. We're out here in the burbs. You got coyotes, crickets. Who knows what else? - Yeah, I suppose so. - And don't forget that damn bird. - Yeah. - You all right? (gentle music continues) - Yes, I think I'm all right. - I mean, you'd tell me if you had a problem, wouldn't you? - Yeah, of course I would. - Hmm? (Charles chuckles) - I'm fine. I'm fine. - (laughs) Okay. - I'm okay. - A Ranger! - The Cadillac of bass boats. - Oh, they're the best, hands down. - Oh man, I got an awesome deal on it too. Found it on the internet. A guy downloaded a picture of it on its homepage. - Hey. Got carpool. - [Charles] Drive safe. - Stan, that's quite a boat. - Found it on the web. - Computers, you know, he... - Oh, all right. Have a good day. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Stan, I was wondering, um, I'm on the road half the time and I worry about my family. - Charles, say no more. My office is right through that window. No problem keeping an eye on them. - Thanks. (children laughing) - Okay, here they come. Make room. - Now don't be trading your lunches in the car. - You have to open that door yourself. - You guys. And no biting, please. Great, great! And be nice to Pattie. It's her first time. - We'll be fine! - Okay! Don't gang up on each other. - Bye! - So Max is our class president and Tracy gets straight As. - [Molly] Yeah. - And everyone's special but me. I mean, I'm not even adopted. - Oh my gosh. - I know because I burp exactly like my dad. - Oh my gosh. Me too. Exactly like my dad. I mean. (toy beeping) Weird. - Very weird. (Pattie giggles) - Hey. - [Charles] Need some help with that? - Nah. It looks like you might. (Pattie laughs) Come on. There you go. - [Johnathan] Whatcha working on, Dad? - Trying to put this thing together. Don't touch that. (suspenseful music) - What are you looking at? I don't see anything. Come on. (suspenseful music continues) Okay, you want juice with your cookie? - [Johnathan] Okay. - So did you decide what you wanted for lunch? (suspenseful music continues) (lawn mower revs) John, did you hear me? Jonathan. (lawn mower revs) (Charles grunts) (suspenseful music continues) Johnathan, you hear me calling you. Now answer me, Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan! John. (spirit growling) (Pattie whimpers) (lawn mower rumbling) Charles! Charlie! There's something in, in the bathroom! This way! There's a guy- - What did you see? - [Pattie] There's something in there! - We saw a ghost! We saw a ghost! - Calm down! - I couldn't see anything. This noise, it was awful. - Pattie, Pattie. - This is Clay Jackson. He's here fixing the ceiling. The contractor sent him. - Sorry if I scared you, ma'am, but you were outta here so fast I didn't have time to explain myself. - Oh my. Did I bust your eardrums? I'm so sorry. - I'm sorry. I should've told ya. I let him in after you were gone. - Yes, you should have. - Clay, it looks like you could use a lemonade. Come on, let's go. Soft drink or something. Sorry, buddy. Watch out for the carpet. (tense music) - Oh my God. - [Delia] Thank you. - I'm so sick and tired of hearing women complain about their husbands and say "There's no excitement in my life." I tell 'em, "You want excitement? Get a hobby." - You and Charles get along all right? - Well he doesn't bore me but maybe because he's never home half the time. - That's gotta be hard. - Yeah, sometimes I feel like a single mom but, boy, when he's home, it's nice. Jonathan. Johnathan, what are you doing? - Don't let him go near water. Keep him away. - You keep away from my son. - I don't mean him any harm. Just listen. He is in danger. - Go, go. (soft tense music) - Watch out for her. - Who is she? - She's a psychic. - We used to go to her. You know, have your nails done, get a reading. - Oh, come on. - No, really. It was great at first. You know, we really liked her. - Yeah, and then one of our friends got suspicious and they checked her out. She's a suspect in a murder. That's why she moved here. (soft tense music continues) - You coming, Mom? - Mom needs her rest. She's had a hard day. Here we go. Hey. - Have a good time at the movie. I'll see you when you get back, okay? - Alrighty, bye-bye. Hey! (doors slamming) (bird squawks) (wind chime chiming) (gentle music) (door squeaks) - Charles? (footsteps approaching) Charles? You guys home already? (suspenseful music) (heavy breathing) (suspenseful music intensifies) Oh, God, I'm losing it. I am really losing it. (door squeaking) (banging on door) Who are you? Why are you here? (suspenseful music) No. No. Please, leave us alone. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. (Pattie crying) (door squeaks) (wind chime chiming) (Pattie gasping) - [Charles] But no one was there. - No, not that I could see. - The room was steamed up, right? Of course you couldn't see. - Charlie, it's not just this. And I've been trying to tell you. - Trying to tell me what? - I didn't wanna worry you because- - What? - Because it sounds crazy. - I don't care how it sounds. I've gotta know. - I feel, I feel like there's something in here with me, something in this house. Things have been happening. Like Jonathan's toys will move when I'm not looking or... At first it didn't bother me. It was a little playful, funny. And I was kind of hoping that... - Hoping what? - That it was the baby had come back to be with me and- - Okay, honey. It's okay. You cry all you want. - [Pattie] I know it can't be true. - No, it can't. I'm sorry. - But you know, it's not just that. It's something else here. Something that is not playful. I get this bad feeling, like tonight, like something is watching me in here. And I know how this sounds. - No, it's okay. I want you to tell me. You've got to tell me. I shouldn't have pushed you into moving. It was, it was too soon. - It's been six months since I lost the baby, Charlie. You did not push me. I wanted to. - What are we gonna do, Pattie? I don't wanna go back to where we were. - Yeah, I know you don't. Halley told me that she saw a doctor when she lost her baby. A psychiatrist. - I think that's a good idea. - And I'm not even sure if these things I'm seeing are really there. You know, it's a new house. I read an article that moving, it's one of the most stressful things you can do. So I guess I'm worried that I've put my family through enough already. I've hurt them, so. - I think you're being too hard on yourself. You had a very traumatic experience. - But what's wrong with me? - People who have experienced painful losses sometimes react in very unpredictable ways. - Like seeing things. - Hearing things, anxiety, sleeplessness. And there is a possibility of postpartum depression here. - The baby didn't live. - But your body doesn't know that. You're still adjusting hormonally. - So I'm not having a nervous breakdown? - I see no sign of that. - What should I do if I start seeing things again? - Well, you could try closing your eyes, taking a deep, cleansing breath, relax. And when you open your eyes, hopefully whatever is there will be gone. (clock ticking) What just went through your head? - Well, you're saying it isn't real. So it can't be my baby's spirit. - No. - He had a soul. - [Dr. Winston] Of course he did. But he's gone now. (soft tense music) - Who are you to say that no one ever comes back? (neighbors chattering) - Did you go to the doctor, Mommy? - Yeah. - Are you sick? - Well, not anymore. I feel pretty good. - Don't forget, I'm the official family taster. Let me know when it's ready. I'm off to the hardware store. See you in a bit. - Okay, this is not happening. This is ridiculous. (laughs) Did you see that? Well, it's not happening. Ignore it. It's not... We'll do what Dr. Winston said. Yes, we'll close our eyes and breathe deeply. Deep, long, (inhales deeply) cleansing breaths. Relaxing, deep, long (inhales deeply) cleansing breath and release. Okay, let's just forget about the cake and I'll vacuum. (vacuum humming) (Johnathan imitates whale vocalizing) (wind chime chiming in distance) - Jonathan, you know you're not supposed to be taking a bath by yourself. Mom! (phone ringing) (phone dial tone beeping) (Johnathan imitates whale vocalizing) - Moll, what kind of sandwich you want? Turkey or peanut butter and jelly? - Peanut butter and strawberry jelly. - Okay. (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) Hello? - [Child] Mommy. - Who is this? (Johnathan yells) - [Child] Mommy. - Are you trying to reach your mom? - Mom! Mom! - Are you trying to find your mom? (child crying) (spirit growling) - Mom, Mom, Mom! (phone dial tone beeping) (suspenseful music continues) - Johnathan. - Mom! Mom! (juicer whirring) Mom! - Mom! Mom! (juicer whirring) - Mom! - Molly? - Mom! - Molly! - Mom! Mom! - Johnathan, Johnathan. - Mom! - Johnathan! (door slams) Molly! Molly, open the door. - Mom! Mom! - Come on, Molly! Damn it, Molly, pull on the door! Pull on the doorknob! - Mom, Mom! (Molly gasps) (dramatic music) Mom. - Johnathan. (Johnathan whimpering) (suspenseful music) (car engine revs) - [Molly] Hurry, Mom! (tires squealing) - Give me your hand. - Try every four hours instead of every two hours. (monitor beeping) It was good you brought her in right away. - Well, I'm worried to death about her. - What did she say happened? - She told me that something pushed my son under the water. And then that he, you know, he... - What does your little boy say? - He's not saying a whole lot now. He's pretty shook up. My nine year old says that her mom's telling the truth. She's a smart girl. She doesn't lie. - Maybe she's not deliberately lying. She's probably come to believe what her mother believes. Children are very protective of their mothers, especially when their mothers are sick. - [Charles] What's wrong with her? - I don't know. She's hallucinating. We have to try to rule out any physical problems. - Like what? - I don't wanna worry you, but could be a tumor or a blood clot. After we finish the EEG I'd like to take a CAT scan. - Here's your pills. You're supposed to take three a day. - I don't want them. - Now, hon, the doctor said that you're supposed to take these. - The doctor didn't find anything wrong with me, did he? - No, no, he didn't. But that doesn't mean something's not going on. - Oh, I think there is something going on. It's not in my head. I know what I'm seeing and hearing is real. There's something in this house and it wants us gone. - What, what, what, what is it, Pattie? - You think I'm losing it on you like I did before, don't you? I am not falling apart because of the baby, Charlie. If I was gonna lose my mind, I would've done that six months ago. I got through it, didn't I? - No. Maybe you didn't. Now for my sake, for the children's sake, could you consider that? - Don't you think I have been considering that ever since we got here? God! I'm convinced, Charlie, the kids are not safe here. It's just gonna get worse. - Okay, maybe what we should do is I'm gonna call my mother, ask her to come and watch the kids, okay? - Why? Oh, what, you think I can't take care of them myself? - What would you think if it were me, if I started seeing things? Huh? What? What would you... - Please, would you try to get past how this looks and just trust me? - No, this time you gotta trust me. If anything else happens, my mother's on the next bus. Look, I'm trying, I'm trying to watch out for us all, okay? You know that. - Yeah, I know that. - It's gonna be all right. - I wanna move, Charlie! I wanna move. (soft tense music) Hey, where are the kids? - I tried to call you, but you were already gone. I'm taking over the carpool. - Right now? - We thought maybe you needed a rest. - Right. You too, Martha? - I'm sorry, Pattie. (soft tense music continues) (Pattie sighs) (engine revs) - Oh. It's you. - You remember me. - Right. You're the one that told me to get away. - Yeah. I apologize for that. - I'm sure all your friends at the supermarket told you all the dirt about me. Tell them they don't have to worry anymore. I'm leaving town. - Well, I don't think I'm gonna be speaking with them again. - Oh. You too, huh? You see a cane anywhere? - They said that you were a suspect in a murder. Is that true? - A friend of mine was murdered. I saw it happen and I tried to stop it. - But you couldn't? - I made it worse. I was a suspect because I was there and I had no reason to be there. No logical reason. Now I have this limp to remind me not to interfere with fate. Now if you don't mind, I've got a lot of things I have to do. - Do you remember the little boy that I was with, my son? Well, what you said about the water came true. - Oh, yeah. Hmm. Your boy's not here. - No. He's out with his dad. Would you like some- - Lemonade? No, I hate lemonade. - Okay. (soft tense music) - Well, there's something here. - My daughter found that out in the orchard. (gentle mystical music) - A boy. A tiny one. - A boy or a baby? - It's a little boy who used to live here. - No, that's not... What are you looking at? (ball slapping) That's it. That, that's it. That, it's moving, yes? That's it, that's what, that's what I'm talking about. It is moving. You see that? - Yes, I see it. - That is what I've been talking about. - It's moving. - You see it! (both laughing) Yes. Yes. (Delia gasping) (suspenseful music) What is it? What's wrong? Delia, are you all right? - You should have told me this house was haunted. It's dangerous to make contact with the dead if you are not prepared. - Sorry, I had to make sure that you were for real. But gosh, you can't go now. You are the first person who's actually believed me. (doors slamming) (playful music) - You might want to start looking for a new house. (door slams) Normally when we die, our soul moves on to another plane of consciousness. But sometimes if people die unexpectedly or violently, they get trapped between this world and the next. - Is that what happened to the little boy? - He's very lost. He's confused. He doesn't even know he's dead. - There's something else though, isn't there? - Yes. Sometimes when people die, they don't wanna go into the light. They're attracted to the darkness. And because of a sickness in their soul, they let the dark take over, they linger. They try to relive events from their past. - Their past? This is a brand new house. Nobody's ever lived here before. It was built on a vacant lot. - The dead are drawn to the living. Give me your hand. (soft music) (Delia sighs) You have three children. That's why they're here. You were looking for something. You were open. Be careful. Not of the little boy, but of the other one. He's using you. He's drawing on your energy. - Like he did to you upstairs? - Yes. Don't let him in and don't be afraid. He'll use it against you. - Don't be afraid. Come on. How am I gonna do that? I've seen what this thing has done with my two kids. I got a husband who thinks I'm crazy. How am I gonna protect them? (soft tense music) - There's a name here on the back. She used to live on this land. - Charlotte Parrish? 1915. You think she's even still alive? Does she have any other family? - None that I've seen. That's her. - Thank you. (senior citizen grunting) Charlotte Parrish? Is this yours? My name is Patricia Johnson and my daughter found this in a lemon orchard. - The orchards. - [Pattie] Yes, we live right next to them. And I understand that your family used to own property up there. - Are they still there? - [Pattie] Yes, they are. Did your family have a house there? - Oh, we had a big old place. - Ms. Parrish, I know this is going to sound like a strange question, but did anyone die up there? Did anything- - Die? Die? My, you're a morbid young woman. - I'm sorry. - You have children. What are their names? Tell me their names. - Molly and Jonathan. - Jonathan. In the Bible his name means gift from God. - I'm sorry, but it is very important really about the house. - In my day, people did die in their own homes. - Yes, now can you remember who it was or how it happened? - I'm sorry. It comes and goes these days. - Ms. Perish, it's time for your procedure. I'm sorry. - Ms. Parrish, may I, may I come and see you again sometime? - This is mine. My mother gave it to me. (soft tense music) Get out of that house. - I just got a call to do a short haul. - Oh, good. We need the money. - I found this sweater in the car. Is this yours? - No. Did you know we have a psychic in town? - No. - Well, it belongs to her. - What, you're seeing a psychic? Oh, come on Pattie. You're not bringing her in the house, are you? I told you, this has gotta stop. If there's something going on with you, you gotta tell me. - I know, I know. - You're making me think I shouldn't go to work. - No, go. You gotta go. I'll be fine. I'm seeing the doctor. Halley has promised that she'd take care of Jonathan for me. Got a problem and I'm gonna take care of it. - I won't be long. (children laughing in distance) - Where are we? - This is my house. - Are you all right, Ms. Parrish? (wind chime chiming) - It's gone. Everything's gone. - Charlotte, are you all right? Would you like to sit down? - I used to play in these fields when I was a little girl. It's... Dear Lord. What did they do with the graves? - Graves? What graves? - This was our family graveyard. - Are you sure? - I could swear it was that tree. We had two stories just like you. I remember. And all the bedrooms were upstairs and... (suspenseful music) A light from the sky flashed above it. The Lord struck him down and he fell to the ground. - Who fell to the ground, Charlotte? Was it the man in the locket? - Oh, Charlotte, Charlotte. Why don't we go sit down? Come on. We'll sit down. Come on. (soft tense music) - Who killed the child? - His father. My father. He drowned my little brother. - In the bathtub? - My mother was leaving him and he wanted to punish her. She shot him. He wasn't always a bad man. He was losing everything. His family, the farm. It just pushed him over the edge. - What about your mother? - She went to jail. When she got out it was never the same. (suspenseful music) (electricity sparking) - Pattie, open the door. (toys clanging) (toy train whistle blaring) (Pattie laughs) (child laughs in distance) (soft music) It's the little boy. - [Charlotte] Who is he? - [Delia] He's your brother. - Daniel? Oh. - He doesn't know he's dead. (soft music continues) Pattie, he senses your loss and your love. He thinks he's your son. He doesn't want to go. You've got to help him. - Me? - He's resisting. He doesn't want to leave you. What would you say to your baby? Did he have a name? - Matthew. - What would you say to him? (soft mystical music) - Your mama loves you. She's waiting for you. And she will see your face again, Daniel. It's okay. Oh, you can go, Daniel. It's okay. It's okay to go. - Daniel, see your mother? She's waiting for you. She'll help you across. Go into the light. (soft mystical music continues) (thunder rumbling) (wind chime chiming) He's gone. - [Charlotte] God bless you, young woman. - Charlotte, would you like to wait downstairs while Pattie and I clear the house? (door slams) (dramatic music) (Pattie gasping) (fire crackling) He's angry at us for taking his child away. He's afraid of going to hell. That's why he won't leave. - Can't you do anything? (dramatic music continues) (Delia groans) - I can't. His will is too strong. You have to do it. - Why? - Because he's in your home, your children. No one wants him gone more than you. (Pattie grunting) (dramatic music continues) (door rattling) - I can't! I can't! - Yes, you can! Don't be afraid. - But I am afraid. Focus your energy. Will him to leave. - Murderer. Bible toting hypocrite. Go away. You belong in hell. (dramatic music continues) (door rattling continues) (soft tense music) - Pattie, open the door. - Did she do that? - Yes. She tapped into her strength. She willed him away. - Then it's over. Oh, thank you. - No. Pattie, he wants your son. - Jonathan. - Especially now that he lost his. (soft tense music fades) (phone ringing) - Is that you, Pattie? - Yeah, it's me. Hi. - [Charles] Sam said you left hours ago. Where are you? - Yeah, I took the kids and we're at a motel. We can't stay there, Charlie. The house is not safe. - What happened? - I told you about the psychic, right? Well, she took me to an old woman who used to actually live on the property when she was a little girl. It was where they lived. And we brought her back to the house. - You did? - She told us that her father killed, murdered his son right there on our property, Charlie, right there. It was violent. This guy was crazy. It's awful. Which is why the house and Jonathan's room shakes. - Okay, okay. - I can't explain it to you but I can prove this to you, Charlie. There is a graveyard on our property. Graves. - Uh-huh. - Charlie, the woman, the old woman, she recognized the oak tree right there. Those are desecrated graves, Charlie. - [Charles] Graves? - Yes. Graves. So you know what that means, right? We cannot stay here, right? - No, Pattie, you're right. We can't. But tell me what, where are you? We need to talk about what we're gonna do as a family. - Eat your sandwich. Come on. Just stay here. Make sure Johnathan stays here, okay, Moll? - Pattie. - What the hell is going on here? - I called him right after I talked to you. He said he'd better come. - Why did you do that? - [Dr. Winston] Patricia. - I am having a conversation with my husband in private. - Pattie, Pattie, Pattie. You lied to me. Now, you didn't go see the doctor. You let that woman in our home, took the kids. I was half out of my mind. - I had to get them out. Charlie. - I know, I know. I know, you did what you thought was right. - So what are you having me committed, huh? Is that what's going on? - No, that's not it. - 'Cause it sure seems like what's going on. - No, we just have to find out what's wrong. What is wrong? - I'll tell you what is wrong. - We're trying to take care of you. - I have got, I cannot leave my kids. Watch Johnathan, no! - Mom, please! - Molly. - Mommy! - No, you cannot take them. Charlie, no, you will not take them! - Patricia, you're making this harder on everyone. (somber music) - Charlie, please do not do this. Charlie. - Pattie, what else can I do? Look at the kids. Look at their faces. I just wanna take them home. I wanna get 'em some hot chocolate and I wanna put 'em to bed. - Charlie, no! You cannot! - You've gotta calm down. - You have gotta promise me. Charlie, you cannot take them. - Calm down. - It is not safe! Call the woman. Call her, ask her about the graves. Ask her about the graves. She will tell you about the graves. You have to call her. - No, no, no, I talked to the builder. There are no graves! There are no graves, okay? - Charlie, why won't you believe me? Why won't you believe me? Listen to me! - There's no graves. - I was in the house, Charlie! I saw what happened there! I am not crazy! - Mommy! - Charlie! Charlie, put them in a hotel at least. - Mommy! - Charlie, look at me! - Mommy! Mommy! - Charlie! Do not take them back to that house! Charlene. Charlie! No! - Johnny, Johnny. She's gonna be all right, sweetie. She's gonna be all right. It's all right. - [Johnathan] Dad, why don't you leave a light on? - We'll turn one on. We'll turn them all on. - I don't wanna go in there. - Me neither. - Molly, this is our home. Everything's gonna be all right. Come on. - No, it's not! - Can I talk to her, please? - She's having some tests done and then she needs to get some sleep. Why don't you call back in the morning? - Are you sure we're doing the right thing? - [Doctor Winston] It's the only thing. (thunder rumbling) (wind chime chiming) - Tell her I love her. Tell her everyone is fine here. - [Doctor] Okay. (wind chime chiming) (soft music) (thunder rumbling) - [Nurse] Your husband called. He said everyone was fine. - Where is he? - Please sit down. I'm gonna give you some- - He went back there. He took them back. - [Nurse] Look, I know you've been feeling upset and anxious about what's going on. - Listen, I need a phone. - Mrs. Johnson, don't make me call the doctor. - Please give me a phone. Please, just get me a phone. - Now, I'm gonna give you some medication that will calm you down. - I don't need medication! What I need is to talk to my family! Please, would you just get me a phone? - I'll be right back. - Could somebody please get me a phone now? (thunder rumbling) (soft suspenseful music) (rain pelting) (wind whistling) (suspenseful music) (water running) (suspenseful music continues) (faucet squeaking) (water burbling) (suspenseful music continues) (Charles whimpering) - Oh my God. (suspenseful music continues) (thunder rumbling) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) (door squeaks) - Dad? (Molly gasps) (Charles grunting) (suspenseful music continues) (Charles grunting) (suspenseful music continues) (nurses chattering) (thunder rumbling) (distant thud) (phone ringing) - [Johnathan] Hello? Johnny. Johnathan, it's me, it's Mommy. Are you okay? - Yes. - [Pattie] Did I wake you up? - No. - What are you doing? - There was a man in here. - Is it Daddy? - Dad's outside. (thunder crashing) - Jonathan, Jonathan, I need to talk to Daddy. Just go outside. Go outside and get me Daddy. Johnny, don't hang- (phone clicks) (thunder crashing) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Delia! (door creaks) (suspenseful music continues) (door slams) (thunder crashing) (Molly screaming) - Molly, Johnathan, wake up! Johnathan, Molly! - Mrs. Johnson, what are you doing out of bed? You know you can't leave. You can't leave. So let me just help you get back into bed, okay? What are you doing? - [Nurse] Hey! - Go! (tires squeal) (suspenseful music continues) - [Molly] Daddy. Daddy. Daddy! - Molly. - Daddy. - Molly! What happened? What happened, sweetie? Where's your brother? Where's your brother? - [Molly] Daddy, I'm scared, I'm scared! - Johnny! (suspenseful music continues) John! John! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny, where are you? - Dad? - Johnny! - Dad! - Johnny, where are you? - It's coming, Dad! - Johnny! Johnny. Where? John, are you in there? Are you all right? - Johnny. - It's coming! Dad! Dad! - What's coming? - Help, Dad! Help! Dad, it's got me! - Johnny! Johnathan! (electricity crackling) (electricity crackling) (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbling) - Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Johnathan! Charlie! Molly! (glass shatters) (Pattie screams) Charlie! (bird squawks) Johnathan! Charlie! Molly! - Johnny! (Charles screaming) - Charlie! - I'm coming! - Charlie! Johnathan! - Mommy! Dad! (Pattie grunting) - I should've believed you. I should've believed you! - I need you! - No, you don't! - What can I do? You see how strong this thing is! - It's not a battle of physical strength. He has no body. It's a battle of energies. Do you love your son? - More than my life! - Tap into that. Don't let him drain you. Show him a mother's love is stronger. Show him the light can beat the darkness. (soft music) (Molly crying) (Charles grunting) - I can't. I can't get him out. - [Pattie] Charlie! - I can't. - Charlie. - I can't get him out. - I know. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - I know. It's okay. It's okay. (soft music continues) You feel that? (Molly screams) - No, Pattie. No. - It's up to you, Pattie. His strength has been drained. He can't help you. - You gotta get him out. - It's okay. (dramatic music) John. Johnathan! No. Johnathan! - Mommy! - Johnathan! I'm here, baby. I'm here. Hold on, hold. - [Johnathan] Mommy! - Baby, you hang on. Hold tight. I'm gonna come down, okay? (dramatic music continues) Johnny, hold out your hand. (Pattie gasps) - Mom! Mom! (dramatic music continues) (Pattie gasping) Mom! - Johnathan, hold on. Don't let go. I'm here, honey. I'm all right. Hang on tight. Don't be afraid, John. I'm coming. I'm coming. (spirit growling) - I'm so tired, Mom. - I know you're tired, baby. But hold on. Don't let go. I'm coming, baby. I'm coming. (thunder rumbling) - Mom! - Leave him alone! You killed your son! You cannot have mine! No! (spirit growling) - Johnathan, don't look at him. Look at me. Look at me, baby. Don't look at him. Look at me. Reach. Reach your hand out. I'm here. Come on, Johnny. Come on, baby. Reach. (dramatic music continues) (Pattie screams) - Mom! Mom, Mom! - No! I am not afraid of you. Do you hear me? I am not afraid. And you will not take my baby. (suspenseful music) Reach. Reach, baby. (electricity crackling) (Pattie gasping) - I love you, Mommy. - I love you too, baby. All of you. - I'm scared, Mommy. - Don't look at it. Don't look at it. - I love you, Mommy. (spirit growling) (explosion booms) Don't let me go, Mommy. Don't let me go. (soft music) - I won't let you go, baby. I won't let you go. - I'm coming down, Pattie. I'm coming down. Are you all right? - Mommy? - Come here, big guy. - Jonathan? - You all right? - [Pattie] Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah. - Let's go. Let's go. - He's gone. - So are we. - Come on. - So are we. (soft music continues) (bird squawks) (bright music) - [Pattie] Hurry. - Come on, come on. Come on! Hey, man. Barbecue Saturday? - No, thanks my friend. We're outta here. Have a good life. Catch you on the web, Stan. (tires squealing) (bright music continues) (suspenseful music) (door slams) (door rattling) - No! No, no, no! - Pattie, Pattie! Pattie, Pattie, Pattie! - Get away from me! - Pattie, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. It's all right. - Oh. - Look, the kids are here. We're all here. (Pattie laughs) - We are out of there. We are out of there. - Yeah. - We did get out. Oh God. (soft music) We are safe, we are safe, we are safe. - [Charles] It's all right. - [Pattie] It's over. (soft music continues) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (gentle chiming music)
