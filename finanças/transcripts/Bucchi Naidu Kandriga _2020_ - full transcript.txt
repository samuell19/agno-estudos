‘I love you.’ ‘Tell me once again.’ ‘I love you.’ ‘I have waited for you to tell me this for so long...’ [Telugu Movie Dialogues Playing on Radio] ‘Just to hear you say this, I wanted to be your shadow. And live with you as my breath.’ ‘But just to hear you say these words, today I am orphaned and left with nothing at all.’ ‘Ten months is enough to know if a child in a mother’s womb is male or female.’ ‘But it took me four years to know, what was in your heart.’ ‘You did not make a mistake, Sandhya. It was me.’ ‘Because to know whether a girl loves you or not, it may take an hour, a day, a week, a month or even just a year.’ ‘But I have been a fool to pursue you for four years!’ ‘I am not the only mad fool. You will find many youngsters like this in Vizag’s Jagadamba centre or at Vijaywada’s Benz circle... at Hyderabad’s Abids or in Guntur’s Zinna Tower centre. Not just one, but so many in Andhra...’ [People cheering] [People cheering] [Movie playing in theatre] When I shouted, you would have seen my anger. But for me, I can see my past. My name is Balu. My town is called Bhuchinaidu Kandriga, the East street. It has given me so many memories. Do you see that house? That is Swapna’s house. It has given me many experiences. The house opposite to it is mine. Where I experienced many feelings. If you have to know my past, we need to go back a few years. Swapna? Hey, Swapna?! Where are you? Hey, Swapna! What, you just had your bath? When do you want to go to college? We will miss the bus. I am done. Give me five minutes to get ready. Such a headache every day with this girl! Yes, please put some sense into her. Till then she won’t understand. Learn something from them First, give me my breakfast. It’s getting late for my bus. Move! Move! You should have hurried before. Till midnight, she watches some cassette in her deck. And gets up after the sun is already high in the sky! Don’t know when she will brush her teeth, take a bath and go to college! This girl has lost all fear or reverence. Mother, come fast! Mother! Ah! Why can’t you hurry up before this? Here, eat. Eat slowly! I have to blame your father for this. Go on! Sir. Tell him! Sir... Why are you mumbling? Sire, it’s... -Shut it! Sire, I believe they can’t find their son since yesterday. What happened? We don’t know, sire. Have you guys fought? Nothing like that, sire. You don’t know what happened to him and neither did you fight with him. Then where did he go? Don’t know, sire. okay. Go. I’ll call you later. Ok, sire. You, feed the grass to the cows and this to cattle. Ok, sire. Hey! Tell me! This guy! No matter how much I hit him he says he cannot forget my daughter, brother-in-law! What do I do with him?! Your parents are crying because they can’t find you. And you are saying you cannot forget that girl. What’s this? I want her. I want that girl. I will forget her! I will forget! You have to! You have to forget her!! I will forget! If you ever look at her again, I will kill you! I will forget! Hey! Ma, my pant’s button has broken off. Why do you tell me now, when it’s time for your bus?! Where’s it? -Here. Wait, I will stitch it. Hey, give Hari your measurements, I will him to stitch you some pants. Hey, leave it! You are another. For a loose button, you want to stitch him new clothes? Hey, you come here! Let me stitch it. Give it to me. Very nice. Hey! It’s getting late for college! Hey! Wait, you are getting late for college! No! No! It’s fine, I will hold it up with a belt. Hey, be careful. It may slip off! Hey, haven’t you guys gone to the bus yet? Why do we have to go every day? Why can’t you go? You are talking too much. It won’t be nice, I am telling you. What will you do, girl? Hey, Padma, let’s go. Come on. You wait a second. Let me deal with this. What will you do? Swapna... I have always liked her a lot since childhood. I feel I can stand however long, just looking at her. I feel like I can just keep listening to her talk forever. I don’t know why but I am scared to talk to her. ‘As soon as I saw you, my feet beg to follow you, my dear.’ ‘My heart keeps asking me, when will our story of togetherness start?’ Darling, my heart can’t be still.’ ‘It makes me run towards you.’ ‘When you are in front of me, my heart feels this unknown joy.’ When my eyes see you around, I celebrate my dreams coming true.’ ‘It feels like the combination of God’s wish and a dream coming true.’ ‘The ecstasy and happiness I feel are my own.’ ‘My darling, my heart cannot stay still.’ ‘It makes me run towards you.’ ‘The second I don’t see you, my heart can’t stop worrying’ ‘I can’t think of anything else. Don’t want magic this is.’ ‘I mistake you for everyone else.’ ‘This mistake has become a habit now.’ ‘If you look in all the four directions. In every corner of the world.’ ‘I see only you, my love.’ It feels like the combination of God’s wish and a dream coming true.’ ‘The ecstasy and happiness I feel are my own.’ ‘Darling, my heart can’t be still.’ ‘It makes me run towards you.’ Just because it’s such discomfort, we get up early in the morning. Otherwise, why do we need such trouble in such cold weather? My stomach feels really bad. Won’t it, then. If you eat little, then it will feel good. But if you eat a lot, then what will happen? I will hit you with this pot! Just shut up and come. Enough! Let’s go. How far has your love story come? Hey, will you only stare at her? Won’t you say anything? I want to. But I am not able to. That is what is called fear. Hey, Chandram. Will that pot be enough for you? Or should I call the fire brigade? Why? Why don’t you come and wash me instead? I have become a joke to everyone. Hey, come on. We shouldn’t have brought him along. It’s our fault! Four. One, two, three, four. Swapna. What’s it? That Balu looks at you weirdly. What’s the story? What are you saying? Yes, I think he loves you. Hey, no! What do you mean he loves me? He is scared just looking at me. Fear? Or love? Hey! You are talking too much. I am warning you. What she is saying is correct. I have been observing this for the last couple of days. He’s acting a bit weird. If you want, wait and see. He will make an excuse to come here just to see you. What is it, Balu? Didn’t I tell you? Look, he’s here. What do you want? Mom asked me to get curry leaves. It is in the backyard. Go, pluck a few leaves. We are here. I came for the curry leaves. I never said you are here for Swapna. Go. Go, pluck some leaves. Hey, did you see? I mean, did you pluck the leaves? Go. Go. Go. What do you say, now? From that moment, Swapna started thinking about me. Do think she found out? Not sure. The way that Padma spoke, was weird. Is it? Hey, when I am so tensed, how can you just say, ‘not sure’ ‘is it’?! Then what? You have been in love with her since childhood. You never tell her that. At least they have come to know. Be happy. Swapna is here. Swapna is here. Hey, Chandra. Mom said she gave something to you to stitch. Is it done? Not yet, Swapna. I will give it to you this evening. Why did you give it to him? There is a tailor near my house who would have done the job faster. Hey, girl. Why are you trying to destroy my business? Get lost! Why is he like this? You only ask him. He will tell you. Hey! nothing. Nothing! Hey, don’t delay anymore. If you are scared to tell her, write a love letter! Ma?! Ma?! Where do I put this? Go put it inside. Why so late? Daughter asked me to get her a cassette. I was delayed trying to get it. Where is she? Inside. Swapna?! Daughter, Swapna? Yes! Dad, I am coming! What is it, dad? You asked me for sugar candy sweet, right. Here. Sugar candy sweet! Sridevi’s sister’s new movie has come out Here, watch it. Gulabi, dad! It’s a superb movie! Get more movies like this and spoil her. Till midnight she doesn’t sleep and watches them a couple of times. Doesn’t get up till the sun is out at 8 am and then hurries to go to college. Look, dad. Shut up and boil some water. you dote on her like that. And when she goes to her in-laws’ house, she will suffer. Dad, I will go fetch Padma and Rani. And we will watch this movie together. Daughter! Come. Do not spend so much time with Padma and Rani. Do you know Venkataramaya or Sundaram’s daughters? Be friends with them. They are from our caste. Remember, don’t get outsiders into our house. Go watch the movie. Is this how you talk to an educated girl? Caste is more important than education. Narayana, did you check the track? Yes, sir. It’s done. Sir, in three days my son will finish his exams. I plan to send him to Nellore. Why? There is some Station Master’s certification,I believe. For that. To do that, he first needs to do a degree, a study of three years. Then prepare of the Railway Entrance exam. And pass it. There is all this to the entire story. That is why I want him to study is a good college in Nellore. Narayana, he is your only son. Instead of keeping him close, why would you send him away to a strange city? It’s my dream, sir. As long as I am in duty, I want to see him as a Station Master. You asked me,’Narayana, did you check the track?’ I want him to ask me, just like that. Very nice. You are a Gangman and your son, a Station Master. What will become of us all then? I didn’t mean it like that, sir. I was just playing with you. Give your son a good education He will become the Station Master. Hey, come quick. They are playing a movie in Swapna’s house, I believe. Her father is also not there. But my father is here. Hey, no movie or anything else! He has to stitch the hooks. Go! Uncle, it is Sunday. Please send him. We will watch a movie. Does he stop eating because it’s Sunday? He eats a lot! Tell him, dad. Tell the whole village, that I eat a lot! When you sit in front of a plate and eat, my heart burns! Here, go ahead and stitch this yourself. Come, let’s go and watch the movie. Let him do whatever he wants. just because I am quiet, he says whatever he wants! Hey! Hey! come sit. Sit! Sit! Hey, you, pig. Move aside. I can’t see it. Swapna, dear? What did your father say before he left? Didn’t he ask not to call anyone home? It’s only for a little while. They will leave when it’s over. If you let him, he will watch the whole day. Hey, you fatso. Move aside. You are in the way. Enough of staring at me. Look at the TV. Sigh, this is why you brought me along. Study! Study! You should get good marks in your exams. Study! Hey, turn around. Hey, show me your hand. Didn’t I tell you not to make a noise? Didn’t I tell you? But it is smelly, sir! Shut up and read. I want an...eraser. Hey, Swapna, he wants an eraser. Can’t you give yours? Mine is worn out. Not just eating a lot, but you should make sure you have everything before you come. Yes, we are the only two people who should talk about food. Is this enough for today? Are you happy? Balu?! What is it? He is writing something. Okay, you eat. Have I ever eaten before he could eat? If he studies like this, he will definitely become the Station Master. When he wears that uniform, waves the flag around, and looks at me and says, ‘Hey, Narayana. Have you checked the lines?’ It will feel so good. Enough with your dream. How can a son call his father by his name? When he is in duty, that is how he will call me. You don’t know. Okay, sure. Hold still. Mother, no. Can’t you stay still?! Mother, please, no! It’s done. Why do you need to scream and shout for this? It is so annoying to do anything for her. Mother? Mother? What is it, now? You can see my waist. Stupid girl. If you wear a skirt and blouse, you will be able to see the waist. oys will stare at me now. Then pin it up. Even then they will see me. As it is I have a beautiful waist. You have to go dressed this way for the Saraswati puja. Padma and Rani will also dress like this. Nobody even sees their faces, why will they see their waists? Hey, when did you come? How does it matter when we arrived? Who will see our faces? [on radio] Hey, Balu is looking at you. Buchi Naidu Kandrika stop... Get in... get in... ‘Oh, my, this feels like a pleasant surprise.’ ‘My heart is delighted, that it’s forget everything else.’ ‘There an excitement in this little heart of mine.’ ‘My youth hesitates like I am choking.’ ‘Eyes that never dreamed before, are now daydreaming.’ ‘What I feel in my heart right now, is first love.’ ‘If he comes knocking, my heart opens to him.’ ‘Love, do you know it’s because knowing him?’ ‘Oh, my, this feels like a pleasant surprise.’ 'My heart is delighted, that it’s forget everything else.’ ‘A nameless direction, this journey takes.’ ‘But waves of excitement form in my heart.’ ‘Never before, have I imagined’ ‘That my heart will soar to the stars.’ ‘It doesn’t listen to me anymore.’ ‘It endlessly searches for him.’ ‘The more I restrict myself, my love grows even more.’ ‘I want to leave what I am doing.’ ‘And follow him everywhere, as a couple in love.’ Slowly, some is remembering you. ‘Oh, my, this feels like a pleasant surprise.’ ‘My heart is delighted, that it’s forget everything else.’ Show me... Hey.. no. Show me your paper. Hey, Narayana, where are you going in such a hurry? My son’s results are out! Why are you looking like that?! Your son has failed his exams. Okay, no problem. He can write his supplement exams. He will write and pass then. For that, he doesn’t have to sit in a corner and feel sad. Hey, Balu, wash your feet and come let’s eat. Hey, what did you cook? Make an omelette Many great people are failing. Nothing will happen. Don’t worry. Hey, what is this? Did you see your father? We were just joking with you. And you are crying like a child. Our boy has passed with first-class marks! Is it?! Hey, Changayya! My son has passed! Veeraswami, sir! My son has passed with first-class marks! My son has passed with first-class marks! Uncle, my son has passed with first-class marks! Very good. My son has passed with first-class marks! Subba Rao, my son has passed with first-clas marks! Did your son pass the exam? My son has passed. Enough now go! -Yes, with first-class marks! Hey, get down from there! I won’t get down. If I do, you will hit me. This is your job now! Don’t utter a word about studying. Stay at home and wash clothes! Wash the utensils at home every day, till you get some sense into your head! I kept repeating, like a parrot, study, my dear. Study. But you don’t listen to me. Changayya! Yes, mam. -Look for a job elsewhere. What happened, mam? From now on, she will do all your work. This is fantastic. Her education is killing me. Instead of standing there like that, come help me cut the vegetables. Why are you shouting? Your daughter has failed. Daughter... Do you know how to sign your name? Doing basic math for the laundry guy? That’s enough! What else do you need? In our caste, studying until this level is great. Education is for those who are less fortunate, not for us. You don’t feel sad, dear. How many subjects did you fail? Four. And you? One. One. I passed only one subject. Swapna?! Can you see it now? Has it come? Not yet! Changayya, not yet! Turn it properly! How else do I turn this? Now see if it’s coming? Has it come? There are dots on the screen. Changayya, they can see dots, I believe. Dots? Turn it properly! Now! Hey, it’s come! It’s come! -Come! Come! Take it. For us? Is there some for us? No, not for those who failed. But you failed as well. Do you want me to switch off the TV? No need. You eat. Her father’s here! Her father’s here! Get up! Get up! Get up! Run! Run! Run! Let’s go! Let’s go! Hey, you wait. Wait! -Hey, stop! What’s this? Tell me the truth. About what? What is happening between the two of you? Hey, let go of me! Tell me in a way I can understand. The girl came and sat next to you. Give the cotton candy-sweet only to you. What’s the story? What is there in that? Oh, you mad fool. Don’t you get it? That girl is in love with you. Is it? -Yes! Hey, nothing like that Don’t make stuff up. Okay, do as we say. And you will know the truth yourself. Hey. -What is it, mother? What are you doing near the mirror? He’s come. Go give him the milk. Has he come?! You?! Yes, get the milk. I have to go. Go. What happened to her now? What is with him? Why hasn’t he come yet? Let me go and see. You don’t show yourself to her tomorrow. If she comes looking for you that means she loves you. Swapna? Why are you here? my hen has come this way. It must have gone that way. Go look. I want some water. I will get you some, wait. Hey, Balu?! Balu?! How come you are here, dear? She came here because her hen has come this way. But why are you shouting? Oh, you are here, is it? Pack your bags, you have to go to Nellore. What do you mean Nellore all of a sudden? Why are you asking him to pack his clothes as soon as you arrived? What’s happening? He is going to stay there and study. He won’t come back home. Come fast! Hey, Narayana Rao, has the bus come? Not yet. -Not yet? Good. Come. There is a lot of crowd here. We have to get a seat as soon as the bus arrives. Before the inauspicious time comes, I hope the bus arrives. It matters what time we left home. Not now. Hey, why hasn’t Swapna come yet? Why will Swapna come to the bus stand? I feel sad looking at these two. If you had passed, you could have also gone to Nellore to study, just like my son. See, how my son studied so hard and passed in first class. Now that you have failed, what do you plan to do? Okay, then. Be careful. We’ll see you. What is this? Why are you leaving before the bus arrives? How? Will your father allow us to stay? Just because we failed once, he is reminding us of it a hundred times. Can’t you keep quiet for some time? There comes the bus. The bus is here! Hey! Hold this. Hold this. The bus is here! come on! Come on! Hey, fatso, give me a lift! Thank god. Got a seat! Hey, son, be careful I forgot to tell you. There are a lot of snacks in the bag. Please eat them, do not share it with anybody. Okay. Once you reach Nellore, call Gopal’s house. I will be there. Forgot to give you the money. You gave it to me at home, dad. It’s okay. Keep this as well. Balu! Careful! Bye, dad! Study well! Careful! I wasn’t surprised to see Swapna at the bus stop. But the way she looked at me was new. I stayed in Nellore for two years without returning. I was studying but all my focus was on Swapna. Before the exams, they ask us to go home for a few days. So, I went back home again. Bhuchinaidu Kandriga...everyone get down. Get down! How are you? It’s been two years since I last saw you. Come, get your cycle. We will talk on the way. Yes, come on. What else is happening? What is there? Padma got married. Is it? You didn’t do anything? Of course, I did. I ate nicely at her wedding. You should have some shame. Hey, how is Swapna? Have you seen her of late? I was just wondering, how come you didn’t ask me that yet. Tell me! I only saw her a couple of times since you left. Now that you are here, you can see her. Okay, let’s go faster. Hey, come you are here without telling us? No, dad. They send us home to study before the exams. That is why I came. Had you told me this earlier I would have come to pick you up at the bus stand. It’s fine, Laddu came to pick me up. Hey, Balu is here! Balu? How come you are here? Before the exams, they give them a few days off, I believe. Is it? How many days? -Four days, mother. Four days? Will they return the money for feeding you these four days? Hey, shut up. You go have a bath. Go! Do you have any sense? Don’t know when to say what. No, I mean... Shut up. Have you seen him? See how is facial hair has come out? That’s true. [Song playing on Radio] Hey, Balu. When did you come? Just now. Why did you stop there? Come inside. Why have you come? For milk? Why haven’t you got a pot? Anyway, I will bring it. Wait. Here you. Tell your mother, it’s a litre of milk. What happened to this girl? She looks like a nail stuck in a wall Hey? Here! What is this? How can you just hold me like that?! What do you think of yourself? I will tell my dad. You are a spoilt brat. -Hey! Wait! When did you get so courageous? I never said that I love you. You did. When?! With your eyes, when I was leaving to Nellore. Oh, my! Father’s here. Who is that? I am Narayana’s son. What are you doing here? Nothing. Go! Why hasn’t he come yet? Hasn’t come yet. I have come. Hey, why are you so late? I had to bring this. Hey! What is this? -Liquor. You don’t drink? I don’t. When did you guys start? Recently. That’s why he has gotten fat. Hey, first open the bottle. I will drink first and give you. No. I brought a glass along. First pour some for me. Don’t you trust me? You drink a lot. Just pour my share first. Ok, here. Hey, pour some more. Hey, pour some more. How much more? Take this and give me the glass. It’s okay. Sorry. Tell me. Have you met Swapna? What did you guys talk about? What else? What else? What else can there be, fatso? You drank everything Hey, stop it. I came here to tell you a love story and you guys are fighting over beer. Balu, forget about us. You are moving too fast with Swapna. Her father’s not a nice man. Be careful. Hey, stop. What is it? Where are you going? I am going to the temple. Oh, since when did my daughter have such good habits? Dad?! [Chants] How can you order me to wear a skirt and blouse, and ask me to come to the temple? Like a husband?! Am I not? Why did you ask me to come? If someone sees us together it won’t be nice. I have to go. Look here. You are spoilt completely. Okay, I am leaving. Leave me. Leave me. Hey, go. Hey, Swapna! Wait. Changayya, who has come? Your uncle’s family, dear. Is it?! Hi, uncle. When did you come? Just now. -How are you? I am good. How come you are dressed like that? What’s happening? What is it, sister-in-law? Don’t know. She had her bath and went to the temple early this morning. She hasn’t told me why. You ask her. What, dear, your face is glowing? What have we come here for and what are you talking about? Brother, why are you quiet. Tell him why we are here. Brother-in-law, my brother’s and your daughter’s astrological charts seem to be a good match. There is an auspicious time day after. Why don’t we finalise their wedding? Look, sister, she is blushing. Save some for later, dear. What brother, why are you so quiet? We won’t ask for dowry. Nothing like that. Whatever we have is hers as it is. What brother-in-law, should I arrange it? You have already arranged everything before coming. So be it. Oh, good. Once the engagement is done, we can get them married soon as well. The wedding has to be at least 6 days long, not just 2-3 days. We have to have an extravagant wedding and invite all our caste people. The wedding should be the talk of the town. Yes, brother-in-law! Look, sister-in-law, just because he is our brother, if you do not treat him like a son-in-law we won’t like it. Go and ask your daughter to make us some coffee. Sure. What else, brother-in-law? We will go to Nellore to do the shopping. Why Nellore? We will go to Madras (Chennai). We will find more variety in Chennai. And will be nice to shop there. We have to buy the bride a nice saree as well. Okay, we will go to Chennai. How can you get married so soon? Why can’t you refuse? You want her to refuse and tell them that she loves you? She has to tell, know?! Don’t you know how her father feels about people from his caste? What are you saying now? We will think of something! What will you think about? Do you know she is getting engaged day after? The same day is his last exam. Do you know that? Are you asking me to forget about Swapna? Not like that. Finish writing your exam first, we can then decide what to do. What if Swapna gets married in the meanwhile?! What are you trying to say? We will do something?! What do we do? Let’s elope. Tonight, the train that goes to Mysore will stop at our station for five minutes. Listen, Swapna. Tonight at midnight, pack your bags and come to the back entrance. Balu will be waiting for you. He will bring you to the station. Hey, Chandra will be waiting at the station with your tickets. Bring Swapna to the station directly. But be careful that nobody sees you on your way there. If your father comes to know, nothing will happen to you. But he will kill Balu. Careful. Come without anyone knowing. Father. What is it? What is with the bag? Where are you going? Nellore. You said you had a few days off. Why are you leaving now? I am needed at the college immediately, mother. How can you go in the middle of the night? You can take the early morning bus Come. Hey, he’s saying it’s urgent. How can you tell him to stay? You come, son. I will drop you. Don’t worry, dad. I will go. What happened, son? Are you unwell or something? Nothing is wrong, mother. I’ll leave now. Dad, take care of yourself. What is this all of a sudden? Have you heard what he just said? Hey, stop it. You go, son. Go. Hey, why are you laughing in front of him? They teach all this in college. What, even this? Why so late? Don’t you know the train will be here soon? I had to pack, know? I had to be careful that my parents don’t awaken. Okay, let’s go. Why are you shouting at me? I won’t come. Go. Hey, I am sorry. It’s getting late. Let’s go. Please, it’s getting late. We are going to be late for the train. Let’s go. Please! Swapna? Swapna? Where did this girl go? Swapna? Hey, Swapna? Swapna? Why haven’t you got a pot? I am going to temple. Hey, husband. What is it? I can’t find Swapna. Maybe she’s in the toilet. She has taken her clothes. What are you saying?! She’s been behaving differently since the last two days. Nothing will happen to you. Doctor! Sir! Doctor! Can somebody please call the doctor?! Doctor! Doctor! What happened? -My son...Doctor! Where’s the doctor! -He’s inside. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Who is it? Who? Narayana? What is it? My son! My son! What happened to your son? Only you can save him, doctor. Okay, let’s go. Please come, sir. What is this, Narayana? At such an hour. Open your eyes! Look! Please, come fast, doctor. He’s my only son. Sir, please have a look! He has been stabbed quite deep, Narayana. Why did you bring him here? Take him to a bigger hospital. Hurry! Please don’t say that. Please, you have to do something! Hey, no! No! Not here. We cannot do anything! No! Sir, please, don’t say that! I beg of you! Narayana, this is a police case. Why do I need this headache? I beg of you! -No, don’t do that ‘Oh, love birds, how long are you going to go on?’ ‘Wonder how far away you are from home?’ ‘You have left your people, your home, behind.’ ‘Have flown towards your house of love.’ ‘The thread of endless hope, pulling you forward.’ ‘Your feet walk take you into a dream world.’ ‘Oh, love birds, how long are you going to go on?’ ‘Wonder how far away you are from home?’ ‘In the light of the twilight’ ‘In the music of the beating heart’ ‘Have you just been born from the womb of your love?’ ‘Will you find joy in the field of thoughts of your tomorrow?’ ‘Has love asked you to run away?’ ‘Has it asked you to cross lands?’ ‘Is it asking you to look for someone to support you?’ ‘In this world, where no one cares about another,’ I didn’t understand the language they spoke. But I knew he was trying to convince her to give us a place to stay. ‘You can be the strength of the other if you have given your heart to them.’ ‘Oh, love birds, how long are you going to go on?’ ‘Wonder how far away you are from home?’ We have come very far. If we have to be together, this distance is necessary. Hey, today is your exam, right? It is all because of me. Hey, nothing like that. You are happy, right? That’s enough. Brother? Not only should you dote on your daughter. But have to look after her. Where can we show our faces now? Why are you talking to her, instead of killing her?! Husband! My daughter ran away. No one in town knows about this. If you shout, won’t everyone hear? Doesn’t mean we have to stay quiet. I have asked for the President. He said he will arrange a discreet meeting at the coconut farm. We’ll deal with this then. Just appear like you are just visiting. Swapna, come in! Oh, look at your face. You come out fast. We will go to the temple. Temple? Why? Are we going to remain like this? Won’t we get married? what do you mean marriage? You asked if we could elope. We did. Let’s stay this way forever! Hey, have you gone mad? Do you want to stay this way without getting married? Oy! Shut up. I thought about this a lot. What is that? We have to get married. You have to go to work. I should cook for you. And have two children with you. Enough. Will you please stop now? Tell me, do I have to do all this only after we get married? Okay, fine. Today the temple is closed. So we can go tomorrow. Is that true or are you making it up? Hey, I promise you. Then I believe you. Why are you so late, Narayana? I was delayed at work, Subbaiya. Come. Subbaiya, the President asked me to come immediately. What’s the issue? What do I know? We are going to find out. If there was any work, he would usually ask me to come to the Panchayat office. But because he’s asked me to come to the coconut farm, I am scared, Subbaiya. Just come Narayana. Ok, let’s go Sir, Narayana is here. Namaste, sir. Come, Narayana. - Sit down. It’s okay, sir. -Sit. Come, sit. Hey, you go now. Okay, sire. You asked for me, I believe. I will tell you. Let them also come. Hey! Stop it! Hey! Pandu! Don’t you understand? Stop. I am telling you. Stop! Stop. I am telling you. Stop! I am going to kill that guy! Hey, Pandu! -I am going to kill him! If you had to fight, then why call me as a mediator? Veeraswami, tell them! Hey, stop it! Sir, I don’t understand what is happening here. Nothing, Narayana. I believe your son eloped with their daughter. No. No. My son has gone to his college in Nellore. I am telling you. Even the Station Master said the same thing. Look, Narayana. No one knows about this in our village. I want my daughter back in my house by morning. Otherwise, you will find your son’s corpse in your house. Why say such things, Veeraswami? Hey, go and find out where your son is, first. They send us home to study before the exams. That’s why I came. They want me back in the college immediately, mother. Father, take care of yourself. Hey, where did you go, leaving me all alone? I was so scared you know? At 9.32 am tomorrow, is an auspicious time. Balu, I am scared. What is this? You were the one who wanted to get married since we got here. I did. But since I saw this, I am a bit apprehensive. If you don’t want, let me know. We can stay this way. Oh, as if. Look at your face. You fell in love with this face only. Why are you sitting in a corner like that? I told you not to pamper him so much. You didn’t listen. Now see what’s happened! Look at what he’s gone and done. He didn’t even bother to think of us. Just left us like this to go live his life. Why do you want to waste your time thinking of such a guy? Here, come. You haven’t eaten anything since this morning. Eat a little. Please eat! How can you ask me to eat? Wonder how he is, what he’s doing. That girl is also with him. Wonder what he ate and what he fed that girl. He would have eaten well. Don’t worry. He has taken Rs.2000 I saved. I had only 5,600 from my salary. He should have taken that too. Enough with this. Eat something first. Leave me. Eat one morsel at least! Tell me! Tell me! I don’t know anything, sir! -Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! We won't leave you. Please, don’t kill us! Stop! Stop! No matter how much we hit them, they are not telling us the truth, brother-in-law. No... no... Sir.... No... no... Sir.... Don't kill us. Stop it, please! We’ll tell you. Please.... Take tonight’s train to Mysore. Swapna, come with me. Where to? I will tell you, come. Ey, where to? Where are you going? I will tell you, come. What? Look. Oye! Balu! Swapna! I love you! I love you more! When will you marry me? Today! I am cold. What are you doing? You said you were cold, so I hugged you. How can you do all this before getting married? It’s wrong, know? We are going to be married today. Even then, no. Okay, let’s go then. I want to be here a while. You say you are cold, but still want to be here. What do you want me to do? Hold me a little. Have you seen these two in the photo? No, sir. Look properly! No. Hey, no matter where he’s hiding in these mountains, we have to find him. Not just find him, brother. We have to kill him right there. Hey, let’s go. [Marriage chants] You will take care of me, right? If you ask me to cook this and that, I can’t. Okay. You won’t hit me, right? You won’t get angry with me, right? If you hit me, I will hit you back. I am your husband! Oh God! I prayed to the scared necklace. Nothing will happen to me, know? Fall at my feet too. Why? Because they say that a husband is like a god. I don’t know all that. Now you know. So do it. Get lost. Tonight at 8.30 pm. What? Don’t you know? I don’t know anything. Damn! Balu, what happened to you?! Balu?! What are you doing here?! Come! I’ll come. You go! Why are you not coming when I call you? Why are you avoiding me since morning? What has happened? Because nothing happened. ‘Let’s see a new world. In new ways.’ ‘Let’s get intoxicated with a battle using our lips.’ ‘Let’s stay this way in a sweet embrace.’ ‘Let’s fill our bodies with this pleasure, through the heat of our breath.’ ‘Let’s forget our sleep. Let’s be alone together.’ ‘Let’s become one. Come be my coupling.’ ‘Let’s bet on letting go of our inhibitions, in the darkness of the night.’ ‘Let’s listen to what our youth is telling us in the throes of love.’ ‘Let my body, light your fantasies.’ ‘Let’s try to quench this unquenchable thirst.’ ‘My desires are endless.’ ‘Let’s stop this pining for each other and celebrate.’ ‘No matter how many sweet injuries we have, we have to reach the end.’ ‘Till the pain becomes please we have to go at it.’ ‘‘Let’s forget our sleep. Let’s be alone together.’ ‘Let’s become one. Come be my coupling.’ ‘The heat our youth is creating, let’s not stop now.’ ‘The heat of lovemaking drenches us in sweat together.’ ‘Your beauty is so enticing.’ ‘Let’s read this poetry of lust between us, together.’ ‘The heat that makes us sweat leads us to our euphoria.’ ‘This firey romance should remain like this forever.’ ‘There is no difference between night and day with you.’ ‘Let’s lock ourselves in and continue making love.’ ‘Let’s forget our sleep. Let’s be alone together.’ ‘Let’s become one. Come be my coupling.’ ‘The heat our youth is creating is drenching us in its sweat.’ Have you seen these people in these photos? No? No? No? No? No? Look after all this properly. I’ll be right back. Balu. someone has come searching for you and Swapna. When? Just now. Let’s go. The girl you asked about is there. - Is it? Hey, Pandu. Come back! We know where she is. Let's go. Swapna, let’s go. Where to? I don’t know. We cannot stay here. What happened? Your uncles know we are here. Let’s go. Why should we leave? There’s no need to fear anyone. I am not thinking about myself. I am scared they will take you away from me. I won’t go. I am going to stay right here. Let’s see what they’ll do! Don’t you understand what I am saying? Don’t you understand what I am saying?! I shouldn’t have hit her. I hated myself at that moment. How could I hit a girl who has trusted me and came away with me? I have to go and apologize immediately. Swapna? Granny, where’s Swapna? I still don’t understand the language Granny spoke, but I realised that Swapna felt very sad about what happened. The moment she said Swapna left, I thought my heart had stopped. Buchinaidu Kandriga, get down everybody! Hey, Balu! Wait, son! Wait! Balu! Swapna?! Swapna?! Hey, wait! Wait! Balu. Let’s go! Let’s go home, Balu. Let’s go! Let’s go home and talk! Dad, will you let me go or not?! Listen to me, son! Listen to me! -Dad! Leave me! I have to see Swapna! What do you mean you want to see her? Shameless fellow! She’s left you and come back home! I don’t believe that! Why would you believe me? You abandoned your parents and insulted us by eloping with her! Hey, what are you saying? • Enough I am so angry, right now! You spent money like water on his education and what did he do? He had his exams on one hand but he eloped with her! Now, what happened?! He lost his education and she also left him! What do you want me to do? I shouldn’t waste my time on him. I have to... Here, I have to slipper her! Mom, I am warning you, not another word about Swapna! Did you see that? Did you see how angry he gets if I say anything about her? Your mother is telling the truth. She left you and came back. Ask Swapna to tell me this and I will never see her face again in my life. What are you saying, uncle? Just because that guy asked for it you have organised this meeting?! I have to kill him for what he’s done! You just give the word, brother-in-law. And I kill him right now! Come! Come! Stop it! Leave me, dad! Don’t you have any other work?! Veeraswami, come with me. I need to talk to you. Come. come Balu. Brother-in-law, why this headache? Just ask your daughter to come and say it, and we can get rid of them. Otherwise, we will lose respect. These kinds of this should be handled discreetly. Swapna! Tell them. Tell everyone you want to be with me. Hey, can’t you wait for a few minutes? Sit down! Sit! Sit down! Sit! Sit down, son. Look, dear, whatever you want to say, say it directly. I will give my decision once you say what you have to say. I loved Balu. That is why I eloped with him. After I left I understood. I don’t want him anymore. I will live with my father. ‘Love, oh, love, you have betrayed me.’ ‘By saying you don’t love me, you took my life.’ ‘Just one word cut me like a knife.’ ‘Uttering those words, became the poison that killed me.’ ‘What is my crime, love?’ ‘I loved you so much.’ ‘Don’t give me a life of tears.’ ‘You showed me so much love. That was just an illusion.’ ‘You said that you were my everything, but betrayed me.’ I think he’s come home drunk. He smells of it. Anyway, what did you cook? Beans and tomato. Wait, I will go get some meat. What am I saying and what are you saying? A drunk will eat a lot I believe. Maybe he’s not able to forget her. He will quit in a few days. My fault that I told you. ‘Intoxication is a boon to my sleepless nights.’ ‘So that I can forget you even in my dreams.’ ‘Let me go far away, further than time.’ ‘To reach a place where you do not exist.’ ‘What a betrayal this has been, is this what love is?’ ‘You said you will never leave me. What happened to that promise?’ ‘You showed me so much love. That was just an illusion.’ You said that you were my everything, but betrayed me.’ ‘Just one word cut me like a knife.’ ‘Uttering those words, became the poison that killed me.’ I thought if you drank you will forget her. I didn’t know you will become a drunkard. If you are feeling so sad, then why did you lie that day? I lied because I was scared where dad will kill Balu. But I didn’t realise it will kill him every day. ‘The eye is mine. The finger that poked it is also mine.’ ‘The hurt s also mine, but how do I tell you this?’ ‘I am selfish. You are the most important to me.’ ‘There’s no betrayal. It’s all fate.’ ‘For you, I distanced myself. The fault is all mine.’ ‘This sin is mine. Please forgive me if you can.’ ‘I love you so much, but how can I tell you this.’ ‘I am still yours, but how do I get to you?’ Swapna, what happened, dear? slowly... Guess, you were born to disrespect me! How can you hit a pregnant woman? Should I hit her or kill her?! First, let’s kill her child. Let’s make her drink the abortion liquid. She will lose her unborn child then! Have you gone mad?! She is in her fourth month. Hey! How does it matter which month she’s in to get her aborted? Along with her unborn child, our daughter will lose her life. I don’t want him anymore. Son? Go call the doctor. Go! Take these medicines one in the morning and one in the evening. If you don’t feel better, come see me again. - Okay, sir. Doctor, he’s awake now. Come, have a look. He is out of danger. I will write a prescription. Give it to him three times a day. Sir, when can we take him home? Let him stay today and you can take him home tomorrow. You will have to bring him back again in a week for me to remove the sutures. Nothing will happen to my child, know? I am telling you, he will be fine. Hey! What is this like a child? Hey, when he opens his eyes don’t start crying. He’ll feel sad. Enough, like you didn’t cry. You are telling me not to cry. Don’t cry, I believe. Don’t I know that much? Why will I cry in front of him? Okay... Ok. Balu is conscious now, I believe. Hey, where are you going? I am going to see Balu. Don’t you know about your father? When you realised you were pregnant who did you tell first? Your father Even I feel like telling him. Come, you are here just in time. His father has gone to work and hasn’t come yet. I will go home and bring some food for him. Okay, aunty. By the way, don’t go wandering off. Keep an eye on him. Son, tell me what you would like to eat and I will make it for you. Tell me! Anyway, I will make your favourite dry fish curry. I will bring some for you guys as well. Be right here. Who are the idiots who stabbed me? Veeraswami’s brothers-in-law. They got men from the next village to do it. Leave me! I am going to kill him! Go! Go kill him and go to jail! He wants to kill, I believe! Do you know how long it’s been since your father slept? Do you know when your mother ate last? Four days! They have been here for the last four days! Just waiting for you to wake up. You got up and want to go kill them! First, look after your parents who are half dead. You have both of them. But for them, they only have you. What is it? The name of Pasuvalathotti Veeraswami has great respect in the neighbouring villages. Everyone says that he is a well-respected man and that he would do anything to have the respect of people. When your daughter came away with me, no one in the village knew. When she came back, even then no one knew. Your respect is intact. Is this because of your greatness or is it because of my father’s kindness? Even though the cousin spreads bitterness, the brother-in-law asks for life, I believe. For your brother-in-law’s sake, you stabbed me with a knife. When Swapna left, I had died. How can you kill me again? But I want to live now. I want to live to stop the tears my mother’s cried when I was fighting for my life in the hospital. The smile my father had on his face when the doctor told him that your son is going to be alright, I want to change my life around for that. I could have said all this to you, outside your house. But I came inside to tell you this so that you do not lose your respect. Your dad was working as a Gangman for the last 25 years. He could tell which train is coming, without listening to its horn, from 5kms away. How could a train run over such a man? If someone dies while they are on duty, the son gets their job. For your future, he gave up his life. ‘As a gift to his son, he’s given up his life.’ ‘This endless debt is the story of a father.’ ‘Do you know that the burden of relationships, measured with lives, is this story?’ ‘Perhaps the only thing worth knowing is the grief of eyes wet with tears.’ ‘Has death lost? Has responsibility won?’ ‘This is the story of a man you gave his life away as a gift.’ ‘Even in death, he’s asking for victory.’ ‘Every victory he gives to his son.’ ‘In the depths of life and death, this is a puzzle.’ ‘In the fires of the funeral pyre is the story of the son.’ ‘‘Do you know that the burden of relationships, measured with lives, is this story?’ ‘Perhaps the only thing worth knowing is the grief of eyes wet with tears.’ ‘Has death lost? Has responsibility won?’ ‘This is the story of a man you gave his life away as a gift.’ Father acted impulsively, mother. To unite you and Swapna, your father didn’t know any other way. Before your father died, he met Veeraswami. They fought for a long time. Do you know what happened there? My son is better. The doctor has said he will be alright. In truth, you have to tell me that. But I know, I am a common man who cannot do anything. Even a common man gets angry and do you know what he does? My son and your daughter fell in love. hey eloped and got married. Now your daughter is pregnant. I want to tell the elders of the village... but I want to take my daughter-in-law home. I will make sure my son recovers fully. I came here to tell you that. Listen to what I have to say! Why do you want to go and tell someone else? My daughter is at home. Take her and go! But before you do, answer me this. I wanted my daughter to marry a government employee. Does your son have that? If he does, tell me. I will send her right away. Veeraswami thought you will never get a job. Your father thought, what is more than his son’s happiness. When it’s raining like this, what are you doing here? Come let’s eat. I’ll come, you go. The news about your daughter has spread through the village, brother-in-law. They want to come home tomorrow and have a meeting, I believe. There are 300 thresholds around here. If your daughter crosses your threshold, we will lose respect. If we have to save our respect then your daughter should lose her head. Hey! Hey! What are you saying? If you mess with my daughter, I won’t spare you. You tell me, brother-in-law. Do you want your respect? Or your daughter? I want my respect. Are you a father? Have you gone mad? If I lose respect, I won’t get it back! If I lose a child, I will sleep with you and have another child! No! What are you saying? It’s true. That day, Swapna didn’t go away because she didn’t want you. Swapna is pregnant. What kind of a father are you? When I was pregnant with her and I was in pain, you prayed to the goddess that she should be okay. When she was born you celebrated. Sacrificed goats like it was a festival! But now, when they are killing her. You are just standing here and watching! What kind of a father are you? He who gave his life for his son, he...he is a true father! Why are you drenched? Go get a towel. Hey, Latha, get a towel. Here’s a towel. Wipe your hair with it. Here you go. Where is she? She is in her room. Has she eaten anything? Where? It’s been aged since she’s eaten properly. What curry did you make? I made mutton curry. Go and give her some to eat. She doesn’t want to eat. It’s okay. Feed her a little. We can’t kill her on an empty stomach. Hey, you. Do what I asked. You go get a cloth and a rope. Swapna, eat some food, dear. I don’t want to, aunty. Eat one morsel at least. Didn’t I say no! Hold her! Come, brother. Tie her hands behind her back! Lift her up! Tighten it! Tighten it! Hey, what happened?! -She bit me, brother. Bit you? Hey! She’s running away, catch her! Where did she go? Where did she go? She must be here somewhere. Search! You go that way. Hey, you go that way. Go! Brother-in-law? Brother-in-law?.. I can’t find your daughter! I’ve searched everywhere! She is nowhere to be found, brother-in-law! Balu’s house is locked. I think he’s run away with our girl. Brother-in-law, we know where they are. Where? They are in Nandyala. We will kill him and bring back our girl. What is the use once I have lost my respect? I will kill her as well and get my respect back. As your father I am telling you, go away from here, dear. They know you are here. I will apply for transfer, father-in-law. Don’t get into trouble because of us. I am the one who should say that to you. All this is because of me. I am the reason for your father’s death. I am the reason for your exile. You are the one who united us as well. Father? How are you, my dear? I am good. How is mother doing? She’s good. Come, dad. Let’s have lunch. Let’s go, father-in-law. Veeraswami decided that his daughter is more important than his caste. If there are fathers like him, they will not be any fights for respect. Balu fulfilled his father’s dream and became a Station Master. But you may think that Narayana is not there to see this. But he’s there. Narayana is in every train that comes to that station. He will watch over his son waving the green flag.
