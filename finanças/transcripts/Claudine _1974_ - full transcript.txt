[doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] Mom, it is Miss Kabak The social worker. Well, do not just stand there, honey. Let her in. Hello, Miss Kabak. Hi, kids. How are you, Miss kabak? I am fine. And how Are you, Mrs. Price? Oh, just fine, fine. But, uh, you know, they haven't sent me The authorization to buy the food stamps for the past 6 months, and then they cut me off for nonpurchase. Now, Miss Kabak, why do they keep Messing with me all the time? Ah, because the system's One big screwup. Well, i'm glad to hear you say it, Cecause no one-- So you're the gentleman That is been Keeping company here. Oh, no, ma'am. I am just the garbageman. Oh, well, may i have your name, please. Simpson. First name? That is my first name. Oh, your surname? X. Simpson X what? Simpson X. That is it. You have heard of Malcolm X? I am Simpson X. Hey, say, listen, i want to ask you something. You are supposed to give aid To dependent children, right? Well, why do not you just go ahead and give aid to The dependent children instead of worrying about who the mother's keeping company with. Oh, let me straighten you Out on something, Mr. X. There was a time we'd ask to use a bathroom to see if there was a razor in the cabinet. We do not do that anymore, but we do have to know What is going on. Do you live here Or elsewhere? Is that a gift you're giving to the family? Do you contribute in support Of this whole family? Whoa, lady! You are gonna tell her She can't have this set? It didn't cost you and the city a damn dime, But you're gonna tell her She can't Have it, right? Well, i didn't make The rules, sir. I am only doing my job. The welfare ain't doing nothing for me, lady. But the Welfare is supporting Mrs. Price. Supporting? It is supporting shit. Yeah, he gave me this. He gave me this. Yes, he gave it to me. And he gave me this. Now we have to hide This shit. Do you believe Yes, he gave me this. We have to hide this. He gave us this, too, but it do not work. That is right, and i have to hide my man In the toilet. Miss Kabak, do you Hide your man in the toilet? Mrs. Price, we want to help, believe me. We know that children Need a man in the house, A woman needs a man in the house. We do not insist people be married. Do you mean you'd help a man move in when he is not married to the mother? That is right. That is immoral. We are trying to deal With the realities. What kind Of example is that To set for the children? Oh, what kind of an example are you setting right now? I ain't the government. We'd love to see you get married. Yeah, i am hip you would. It would take the government Off the hook and put me on. Do not ask me Any more questions. Charlene asked me if i loved you. I didn't tell her that i'm too smart To fall in love With anybody. Heh. What do you want With me, anyway? I got 6 kids and aching feet. I think you're a great woman. Me? I remember my Mama, Her kids. Clean and wash and cooking, just... doing it all for them children. Last one in bed at night. So weary, she'd shake herself to sleep trembling. It is not the work. It is the worrying all the time, the shitty neighborhood and the shitty school and the shitty world. No matter what i do... Roop... I think we are coming to the end of this project. Cut it out. Just facing reality. Bullshit. You know what my mama told me? She told me lilies that fester Stink worse than weeds. Baloney. You can talk a thing To death, you know. When i look at you, My teeth hurt. What are you gonna do about it? See a dentist? Hmm. What can we do? Mmm. Ain't nothing We can do. Yeah, i told you. No, no. It is too late for that... Home and family stuff. I made some bad mistakes, bad moves In my time, and you made some bad moves. Can't make no more bad moves. I am tired of you running me home at 2:00 in the morning. I keep telling the kids We've been out dancing. I am faking it to them. I am faking it to myself. Roop, i want to be with you, and i want to know that you are there. Uh-oh, uh-oh! Goddamn it! Claudine, do not try to put me on Welfare. You wouldn't be on no Welfare. You'd be a nonrecipient. They'd even cut me off. Just...just the kids Would get the aid. Roop, it wouldn't cost you no more Than it is costing you right now. Jesus Christ! Trying to put me on welfare. "fill this out. Fill it out. "when did you get The check stubs? How much for the car? How much for the rent?" You look up your asshole to see if you got a dime hidden up there. Shoot, i ain't putting up with that. I put up with it! Yeah, you have to put up with it cecause you a woman, you had the kids. I have to put up with it cecause i'm a woman, I had the kids. Claudine, they'd cut my balls off, and you'd look at me and hate my guts. I am hating your guts right now! You men got some crazy ideas about being a man. Fighting, beating up On somebody, that makes you a man, right? Screwing all the broads and making babies, That makes you a man. Big man! Nobody ain't gonna tell Rupert B. Marshall How to spend his couple little shitty dollars. You got some bad balls, Rupert. I got better balls than you any day. Damn it, Claudine! Now, listen! You had it. I ain't never gonna leave you. And tomorrow, Me and you are gonna go down to that goddamn welfare, we are gonna talk about this goddamn thing and try to goddamn work it out. Oh, goddamn, Roop! [sobs] Goddamn. Now, you understand that if you get married, we might drop Mrs. Price from the program. But this will be determined after your financial status has been computed by us. It has nothing to do with aid to the children. You understand? Now, if you Will sign this statement That shows your income and your expenses, Mr. Marshall, and get it back to me within 2 weeks. Do you understand? Yes, i understand all that, but listen. I have got to ask you something, because, uh, I got to think about this thing. What happens If i lose my job? If you are married, you must apply for welfare. Oh, i must Apply for welfare? You must apply for welfare. Otherwise this would constitute a misuse of A.D.C. Funds. Which is fraud. You understand? If the husband's unwilling or unable To make a contribution equal to what It would cost him to maintain an independent living arrangement, he must apply for welfare. Do you understand? Otherwise this would Constitute a misuse of A.D.C. Funds. Which is fraud. Which Is misappropriation. Which is fraud. Right. Ok, now, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Uh... If i marry this lady, I want to make things better. But if i spend a dollar on it, You are gonna deduct it from her, right? If i wanted to buy a little something extra, You are gonna deduct it. And i better report every penny i spend, or else i'm a crook. Ok, now, you say If i lose my job, I must apply for welfare because i can't just sit around eating the government's biscuit. Which is fraud. It is cecause that's a fraud, right? Ok, now, if i do go onto welfare, Then i'm just another lazy-ass nigger living off the taxpayer. All right, now. Suppose i do not marry this lady. Now, if i move in with her and do not tell you, then we're both crooks, right? But if i do tell you, then we are back to the income and the outcome and the--and the deducting, and you drive me to drink! And you call it fraud If i spend $7.00 for a bottle of whisky!
