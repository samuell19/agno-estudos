(Radio) What's the most embarrassing experience in my life.. well, that's a hard one, Tommy. I've done so many dumb things in my life, but if you press and pulled out my finger nails, I'd had pick one Tuesday night in July, a few years back, in '61 or '62, when I was head lining at the Grand Ole Opry. Ali the gang's there-- Hank and Willy and Loretta, and so when it's time for my spot, I'm really up for it. In fact, I'm almost on fire! Until it gets up to the last verse of my song and I have fo sing the word "darlin" as in, "l jove you dariin'." Well, the "dar" gets out okay, but when I hit the "lin," my teeth shoot clean across the foot lights and land right in the lap of Hank's momma. Yes, sir! Right in her lap! Most of the folks there probably couldn't believe what they just seen. And fortunately, this old gal is a real classy lady. Because she just scoops up those old false teeth and pops them right in her little black bag. And after the show, she comes back stage to my dressing room. When no one was looking, she slips me back my dentures. And then she leans over, real close, and kind of draws, "Boy, you be careful who's lap you go throwin' that thing into because where I come from, most girls would take that for a proposal.

It's nice to see you again, Mr. Davenport, right? Jack. Let me turn this down. That Charlotte Hampton story is huge. But I hear she's got a sister who's gonna try and sue her, even before she gets the money. How do you know that? I've got my sources. I decided to take you up on your offer. Oh sure, anything, name if. I'm looking for information on the Reverend Krauss... or anything concerning his church, around December, 1963. Well, you came to the right place, come on. So you're doing a story on the ol' Rev', huh. Some research... trying to get some information. Yeah, well, we have a pretty extensive research library, and over here we have our microfiche that dates back to about 1920. Lets start with the Reverend Krauss in the 60s. Okay. Been a long time since I used one of these. Lets see, here ya go. Okay... Oh, look at this, look at this, look at this, baby Jesus returns. Ah, I've never seen this before. "The baby Jesus, part of a hand-carved set donated in 1955 by a local woodworker, was taken from the Church sometime fast Sunday." "The Reverend Krauss awoke to find the wooden baby Jesus back in the manger." Why would somebody steal it one day, then return it the next? I don't know. Maybe a rival church across town. [laughing] Alright, lets go to December of 1955. [motor idling] Look at this... "A gift to my dear friend, Reverend Krauss, and in loving memory of my wife. Ottolman's wife died in a fatal car accident in 1945." What do you know about Ottolman? Now, that's a little bit before my time, but obviously he was close to Krauss, right? I wonder if he's still alive? Hmm, I'l go online and check the obits. "And the gift was warmly received by most of the congregation, yet some of the individuals were troubled by the woodworkers depiction of the baby Jesus. Carved within the chest of the Christ child, Ottolman chose to place a simple wooden scarlet cross." [motor revving] There is no current listings of Ottolman in the whole state of Texas. But, I did find this phone book from 1955. And it says it has an Ottolman at 1729 Sullivan lane, I know exactly where that is. He's not living there now. Well, maybe we can find something out. All right, lets give it a try. Okay, great. Car's out in back. [birds] chirp, chirp, chirp... knock, knock, knock Hello? Can I help you? Ah yes, I'm here doing some research on Clearwater. A journalist? Yeah, I'd like to find out about someone who used to live in this house. Come on in. How long have you lived here? About eight years, now. Now it's just Kylie and me and she's in school. I'm pretty sure that a man named Ottolman lived here with his family sometime in the late 50s, early 60s. Ottolman... I don't know. He was a woodworker. Ya know... it was all here when we moved in. I can't believe someone would've leave this behind. This is Kylie's room, she just turned ten. This was here when you moved in? It surely was... my little girl, she just loves it. Ottoman had a daughter. I'm glad you stopped by. I found this today. The Reverend Krauss gave it to me, years ago. Your picture reminded me. What did he say when he gave it to you? I don't remember... It's really important. He gave us so many things... Sounds like he was a very generous man. Sincere, dedicated... oh, and he could preach! Like this, um... The baby Jesus was born with love in His eyes and the cross in His heart. [clapping] Reverend Sarah, you keep that up, and you gonna put me out of a job. Oh, I was telling them about the Reverend Krauss. You go right ahead, don't let me interrupt. No, no, I think I'm through. Besides, they didn't come to hear me preach; they came looking for you. Well, I was just on my way out. Can you walk with me? Sure. So, what can I do for you, today? Iwas hoping you could answer a few questions. You'll know who to give it to! 1 remember now. That's what he said, "You'll know who to give it to." Since you have the other one, I 'spect that'd be you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I've only been here about three years now, so I sorry, Jack, I don't know anything about these pictures. This place does have quite a history beyond me, though. What about the scarlet cross? Oh, the one in the manger. Yeah. It's missing. Missing? Yeah, come here, I'l show you. That's where it used to be. It's really interesting, they say the woodcarver wasn't a believer when he first started the nativity. But when he carved the face of the Messiah... something happened. People say his life really changed. And the scarlet cross, where is it now? Well, that's a good question, nobody really seems to know.

Hey, you got minute? Listen... I've thought a lot about what you said last night. It sounds crazy now, but right before we adopted Grace, Deborah and I panicked. I mean we really freaked out. We were so afraid that we wouldn't be able to love her, as much as we did Josh and Robert. But then the first time we held her in our arms, and looked down at her tiny face... it was nothing short of miraculous. It was like our hearts just exploded with love and we knew, somehow, we just knew that she was our daughter. A gift from God. And you're right. I mean, she's never gonna know why she was abandoned, and neither will we. But, what she will know, is that she has a family that loves her like crazy... and most important, she'll know, that just like us, she has a heavenly father, Who loves her, even more then we do. Do you really believe that? Ya know, I don't have all the answers. Boy, I sure don't have it all figured out. But yeah, I believe with all my heart that God loves us. He came.

Let us remember that this scene represents so much more than just a touching story, or a nostalgic holiday fairy tale. It is, in fact, a reminder of a most amazing reality, that God came and God spoke. Peace on earth, God is with us, and the God who spoke still speaks, and the God who came, still comes. Now, aren't you glad I made you come? Darling, I'd come anyway. That as we stand here tonight in our real world with our real lives, full of problems and questions... past hurts and future hopes...
