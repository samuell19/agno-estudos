Following Ariane's thread - Hi. - Hi. - Happy birthday! - Thank you! Hi Mom, happy birthday! Happy birthday! I'm with Ludovic, we'll be here in two days. Kiss. Happy birthday! Happy, happy birthday! Yes! Coming! Hello! - Here are your flowers. - Thank you Sir! And happy birthday. Hi honey, it's me. Well, happy birthday. I hope you got the flowers. I'm still in Bordeaux now. I'm not sure I can go home tomorrow. I send kisses. Have a nice birthday with the kids. Hi Mom. Clara told me she is in the Alps. Well, I send kisses. Have a nice birthday. I hope you are not alone. Kisses. Excuse me, do you have light please? Thanks. Come on! - Do you often dance here? - It's the first time. I'll come again. Don't you think a guy selling sandwiches would make a fortune here? Oh, you are hungry! Yeah, kind of. If you want, a know a nice place. - But you won't dare following me. - I won't what? - Dare - I won't dare? I will dare. I'm a very daring person. This way, ladies. Hello Martine! Sit here, it's the best table. Sun and comfortable chairs. Come on, come in. There is still some room. Do you have a table outside? There may be 2 or 3 places left. Here, I got you a hopeless woman. - I'm not hopeless. - That's not what she told me. I said people are hopeless. - What can I get you? - Desesperados. No, a strong expresso please. One strong expresso. How many are you? - What do you mean? - How many of you will have lunch? - I'm alone. - It's original. Martine will find you a place. Martine! I'm not sure I'll have lunch. Even more original. But you're right. People having lunch in restaurants are like people swimming in swimming pools. Incomprehensible. 3 wants to lunch inside after all. Of course, the poor are old and cold. Put them inside, hurry up. If you want I have nice red mullets. - Martine will find you a place. - Give me a glass of white wine. Here is some wine. Here is Jack, our American. And you, Madam are... - Ariane. - Ariane. Ariane, Jack. Jack, Ariane. - You're American? - Yes. - You're American? - Yes. No, you aren't American. - Yes. - Impossible. - Yes, I am. - IAM, they are from Marseilles. No, I am is American. See, you're not American! Martine! Please, the lady at table 4. Come with me. - Don't we know each other? - I don't know? You can use this one. A lady eating alone in a restaurant... is unacceptable. It never happens. It's incomprehensible. Well... it happens. I am incomprehensible. People pass, see me and think... "Oh! An incomprehensible woman!" They must think I follow someone. Like I track someone. I don't just follow. Because... I know who I am. I don't need to follow anything. I don't follow anybody. Or maybe I track myself. That's all I do. People pass and must think... - "Oh, a woman following herself!" - I have understood. A woman... following... A woman... following... "herself." 30, it's okay. - He's leaving? - He's taking Lola to work. - How do I do? - I would have taken you but I can't. - I'll call a cab for you. - Yes, please. Too bad we have to go to the market. If I don't go, my parents will tear me apart and eat my flesh. They are voracious, you know. Bye! Let's go! - Where are you going? - Near the harbor. I don't know what it's called. This is not looking rosy. "Near the harbor. I don't know what it's called." Get in. I'll have to note it. "Where are you going?" "Near the harbor. I don't know what it's called." Which harbor? Kazakhstan? Northern Sea? La Seine sur Mer? Mauregot? There are harbors everywhere! Le Havre? Ingushetia? What music do you want? Modern? Classic? Blues? I know what I'll have you listen to. This voice! This guy's voice! I collect voices. I love voices. Let me tell you, I have 45 cats. It may sound like a mess but not at all. They listen to the music I put on. Can you believe that? They listen to the music. But there are some voices they can't stand. You don't say anything. You are thinking. What are you thinking of? She won't say a thing. I'm heading to the harbor Idunnowhatitscalled. Let me tell you it will not be cheap. Tell me... How long will you let me go in circles? This will not be cheap! Stop! Stop! Follow this truck! It's there! It's there! Follow this car! I knew it! - Can't you go faster? - Then I have to put on blues. Hurry up, we will lose it. They can go the wrong ways because they bribed the police. But if they take my license, will you feed my cats? - That was a good one. - Faster! Easy, I know where they are going. There is only one impound. This will not be cheap! I don't take credit cards. You think I want to give money to the banks? The impound doesn't accept it either. I don't think I have enough money. - Is there an ATM nearby? - Of course, they need one. - Just in front of you. - Right. You can take more and tip me. I knew it! I knew it! I almost told you! Fuck! We're in deep shit! What does that mean? How can we live in this world? Fuck! I saw it coming when I heard the mob! - Stop shouting! - Why not? It's my money they stole? What will I do now? It will cost you a lot! Well take me back to the restaurant. I'm sure the owner will lend me the money. It's on the other side of the city. Stop joking. I'm a taxi driver, not a social worker. Here we are. We're in deep shit. Don't cry like this. It will cost us a lot. I can't stand it anymore. I can't. I will take her back. I will take her back! I won't start the counter. Okay? There's a point where the counter stops. What will it count? The wind? What will my cat eat? Some days I'd rather break my leg. You know what? You're a walking catastrophe. Oh, I will put some Schubert on! It will calm you down. It works with cats. Schubert works! It always work. It calms them very efficiently. Schubert's Trout. Do you get it? Schubert's Trout. You need to be cultured or it's not funny. Let's go. It's closed! Wait 5 minutes! He went shopping, he will be back. Yes, sure. Give me your phone number, I'll pay you tomorrow. Tomorrow, sure... Another good day for me. I hope I'll have more of this. Enough with you for today. Hello? Of course! I'm having the time of my life! Flowers? Yes! A lot! So many of them! Like a burial! Yes. Well... On Monday. Or Wednesday. Yes, you can come on Sunday. It's all the same. Yes, okay! I send kisses too. Okay! No! No! No! I'm perfectly normal! Why do you say that? Listen, I have to hang up now. Okay? Bye! I... I took shelter. No problem. The rain will stop. It's only a brief rainfall. Phones are convenient. They are good. We can tell anything we want. They have to believe us. They called me once. Know what I told them? That I was in Douala. "Yes! Yes! I'm in Douala!" "I'll be there tonight." He was crying! He was happy! In the end they understood I wasn't there. "It's not possible, Martial!" "Martial! We never know if what you say is true!" Are you alright? Don't stay here. Do you know where you'll sleep? - No. - Come to my place. Good night then. Good night. They're leaving one by one the village To go and earn their living Far from the land where they were born They had been dreaming for a long time About the city and its secrets, The Formica and the movies. For the old people, it wasn't strange When they wiped their lips Mechanically with their sleeves. But they knew all about Killing quail or partridge And eating goat cheese. However How beautiful the mountain is! How could one think While watching a flock of swallow That autumn just arrived? With their hands over their heads They had built low walls Until the top of the hill No matter the days, the years They all had a well-born soul Gnarled as a vine stock. Vines run mixed with wood Wine won't be done any more It was an awful cheap wine But it was making people live hundred years, And these people were numerous, If it didn't make you feel dizzy. Good morning, Sir! Oh, yes! How beautiful the mountain is! How could one think While watching a flock of swallow That autumn just arrived? So, good night? Perfect. Four stars! Cradled by the sea. What's all this? Souvenirs. What souvenirs? Mine. My souvenirs. Take this. - It's for you. - For me? Thank you. To the kitchen, hurry up! Go now! It's hot! Don't do it like last Saturday. Take care of this properly, kids! Thank you. And Martine? What is Martine doing? What about the 30 that are coming? You asked already! Your record is scratched! God-damn! - Are you always in such a good mood? - Not at all. I'm a business keeper, it's different. Behind the bar, I have to smile. People say so. They are right. In real life, he's a real pain! - Will you have lunch here today? - I don't know, I don't... Maybe. If she has lunch here, one more for me. You are insatiable! You are scratchy and insatiable! - Do you know what he asked? - No. He wants a share because he brought you here. It's our deal! If she has lunch here again today, she will become a regular. What did we say in our deal? What? No share from the regulars! That's our deal. - She was not a regular yesterday. - She became one! Right, Jacques? Yes, the girl is a deal my friends! Of course! And Martine? No news yet? We can't manage without her. Do you want me to help? What is that? Who are you? An angel from Heaven? They are many! - Bye! - Bye! See you soon! Bye! Bye! How pretty you are! Are you having a walk? - You call this a walk? - Who said that? - Is anybody here? - Me. - "Me" who? - Me. Here. - You? - Yes. - You can talk? - Of course! But a talking turtle... - That doesn't exist. - And people talking to turtles? - You think that exist? - It's not the same. She's a good one! She asks a questions and is surprised to get an answer. Well I'm polite. When I'm asked, I answer. You are polite. And pretty! Yes! What are you doing here? I left my house. - Where are you going? - If only I knew... You don't know where you're going? No. Not knowing where you go must be formidable! - Do you think so? - Of course! Don't you realize? We are always home. This is our homes. I've had it up here! I can't find a way out of it. Let me tell you, this is not a life. It's horrible. Believe me. You don't know how lucky you are. You're sleeping! Move! Move! Come on! - Fuck! What time is it? - We're going, man. - It's time to go now! - Okay, let's go. - Are you seasick? - No. - Follow me then. - I'm following, I'm following. I'm following more and more. Starboard! They are over there! Over there! Yes, this way! Go ahead! Where there are small birds there are small fish. You think he's crazy? He's a genius. A real genius. He knows everything. Right, Jack? You know everything! He's focused now. Show her! Read us what you wrote. You'll see! The strength of the myth, either pagan or religious, is to allow a community to unite against the infinity of the sky. It's to allow to a group to exchange, in the same temporality, with past forces and sacred souls of the Earth. The economic growth drove Occidental men away from these rites. Nothing is more contradictory than forgetting. But, still, we forget. Nowadays, our countrysides only speak about the spectral survival, almost frightening, of what used to be the beauty of the world, before the devastating fury of liberalism. Here we are. He fucking amazes me. You know what, Jack? You are amazing! Seriously, how can he finds that? "The devastating fury of liberalism." It's beautiful. It has rhythm. He's always right. He's writing the great book that will change our world. That's why I feed him. - You're kind of a sponsor. - Right. Exactly. - Were you sleeping? - No, no. Come in. Take this. Look. This is where I used to work. I've worked there for 30 years. Here. This is the elephant's room. It used to be behind a fence, with his house. But he got pneumonia and the poor was stuffed. - You were keeping elephants? - Yes! Yes! Yes! - Where? - In the palace. Longchamps Palace, the Zoo. These are the jars from the Museum of Natural History! I remember now. My father took me there every Sunday when I was a kid! It's me! - I was the keeper! Don't you remember me? - Well, no... 30 years. I worked there for 30 years. Every morning, every evening. Here. They are my children. All of them. She is In?s. Here is Octavo! Octavo is really pretty. He misses me. You know, Madam... He misses me. They all miss me. They wish I were there with them. I've visited them every night fr so long! So wish them a good night. For my children to sleep well. But now... I'm too far away, you understand? I can hear them crying. They are suffering. So I tell them: "Don't cry! Don't cry!" They can't hear me, I need to shout so loud! They are far away. I can't abandon them. Don't cry. It's okay. It's nothing, it's the rain. It's the rain. Every night, it's okay. Wait! I think it's here. I'm ashamed. I haven't come in 20 years. People here don't count years. If only we could know... Are you coming? No. See? I'm your age now. I made it, Mom. Starting from today, I'm older than you. You loved your songs more than us. Cabarets, concerts, shows... You did whatever you liked. I come to tell you were right. Right to creep. But it's been 20 years now. You wan to know what it feels like to be your age? I don't know. It does nothing. - What happened? You felt? Are you okay? - No, it's nothing. Everything is fine. I'm very fine here. - Are you sure you are alright? - Yes, yes. Leave me here. - How will you go home? I gotta go. - Just leave me here. So you make cabarets shows too. Didn't you hurt your head? Come on, Lola will get mad at me. Let's go. Here you are. - And there. - Are you new? - You may say so. - Martine won't come anymore? - Martine is her fianc?e. - Oh, I can have a new fianc?e. I'm sure sure Martine will agree. My bird, she doesn't play the starlet She doesn't put on Sunglasses She doesn't pose for magazines She works in a factory At Cr?teil In an overpopulated suburb We live in a furnished flat She and me The window has but one pane Which overlooks the warehouse And the roofs We don't go to Saint-Paul-De-Vence We spend every holiday At Saint-Ouen As a family we have but a godmother Somewhere in Lorraine And that's far But my bird, she's twenty-five And I really think that the Blessed Virgin Of the churches Hasn't more love in her eyes And doesn't smile better Whatever is said At Summer, when City falls asleep At home, there's sun Which lingers I lay my head on her loins I slowly take her hand And keep it We tell each other all the things that come to us That's as beautiful as Verlaine, It would seem We look at sunset And then we make love Secretly My bird, she doesn't play the starlet She doesn't put on Sunglasses She doesn't pose for magazines She works in a factory At Cr?teil Can I take her with me on the boat? And I will stay here, alone, like a dog under the snow. Thank you! Of course you can. Let her have some fresh air. Are you happy? You are not answering. I had a dream. You never talked to me. This is the most beautiful day of my life. Denis I live with Denis, he never took me anywhere. Thank you Ariane! Thank you! You are very welcome. Do you think I love old people? What do I care? He's a pain. He's jealous now. I didn't need that. Impossible. - I have to work tomorrow. - You could have a sick note. Honey... a sick note? You have a kind doctor. Will he sleep with my clients? Don't tell me you... A whore. Yes. Why? In one night I earn more than the minimum wage. Why wouldn't I? It's securing. I have a bed and a bathtub. I have appointments, I can cancel. I go to holidays whenever I want. I can buy everything I like. I have only slept with I husband. I'm not the type to be looked after by some guy. - Rather many guys. - Don't judge adulterous women. They will be forgiven become they will have loved a lot. If the Bible says so... Poor Rapha?l. Rapha?l... Rapha?l is a dreamer. We can't earn a decent living with these old tourists, let me tell you. Our generation has no future. Also... he's jealous. He thinks like 19th Century people did. He hit you so you don't do that anymore. Yes. What's the opposite of a mackerel? (pimp) Well... A goldfish? Get out of here! You break everything you touch! Okay, man. And remove your hands from there! Don't you see you will get electrocuted? No, no, no. - This thing has to work. - Never, never. "Never, never." What a pain you are with your "never never". Is it open or not? - No, it's closed. - Can we dine? We will find a way. I will cook you something. Aren't you working tonight? I'm not in the mood. Rapha?l ditched me. I don't know what to do. I always thought Rapha?l was a bit special. Guys, let's eat and talk about something else. Why are you always closed in the evening? Listen... Some have been slowly poisoned by asbestos. Others have crushed bones because of tin steam and acids. These are working heroes. Their tearful families are haunting the rooms of useless efforts, asking for deserved compensations. But if I open in the evening, I'm a dead man. Alcoholism is not a professional disease, it's a shame. I, in the evening, only drink water. Very good. Don't worry. I will help you. He will bring a bus tomorrow. You can see him then. He loves you. He told me that's why he hit you. I won't be a cashier again just to please him. Love... Love... Do you know what love is? It's... to give what you don't have... to someone who doesn't want it. - Did you invent that? - Yes. Impressive. Here, have a drink. What was that? Martial is wishing his children a good night. It's not good. It's not good at all. - What do you want us to do? - You will just stay here? Action-less. What are you waiting for? Won't you go see him? - We all tried. - It changed nothing. - "It changes noting"? - No, it doesn't. And you let a man crying his life out? - It's good for him. - It removes the pressure. You are monsters. Where am I? With heartless monsters. A man is crying and you don't move. Why didn't wait for you to have a heart. We hired him to be our guard. We gave him a job. And it was not charity. There is nothing to guard here. But he needs it. It's been a guard his whole life. We pay him a little, for nothing. But it makes him happy. And I think we can help him more. He is... crazy. Completely crazy. In?s! Octavo! The sandman is here! Close your eyes, kids! Good night! Martial. Are you okay? What's going on? Erase... Erase... Who's there? Who? - Can I do something? - No! No. There's nothing to be done. It's too late. It will be over. - Did you do all of this? - Yes. I did. For the kids. For my kids. Martial, this is not a life! You have to go back home, in Douala. - I can! - Why? - Because of the money! You have a pension thanks to your work. You can have a good life in Douala. Yes. But it's not that simple. Don't you know? You have to live here to get the money. - Otherwise, it's suspended. - Really? Yes, it's suspended if you leave. You must have an address here or it's not possible. Here, look at this. The paper says so. It's written. Yes, it's the law. The law! Yes! It's written! Written! - Are you sad? - No. I'm thinking about what I am. - And what is your thought? - All of a sudden I realize... If you leave your place... If you remove yourself from your own landscape... You know what? Everything works. Everything keeps going on. You're like a stock under a wardrobe that was never used. - Your kids didn't call? - Neither my husband did. Lola! Where is Lola? - In my pocket. - Be serious. Who were you talking to? - The turtle. - Enough. Where is she? I love her. I never loved anyone like her. Do you know what happens in my head when I imagine what she does? I become crazy and can't stop thinking of it. But she's not living in your head. She lives in this world, like we all do. You can't hit a woman. Even when trying to stop her behaving badly. I had never hit anybody. I don't know what's gotten into me. It's her fragrance. When she comes back, she wears that fragrance. I don't know what's going on. My vision is blurred. It's too much for me... It was too much for me. You know what being a man is? It's resisting to what is stronger than you. Come on, follow me. I'll help you. She's pretty, isn't she? Very pretty. So you truly are an angel. You actually fell from the sky. I feel like it's a dream. My dream... My real dream... - Do you what it it is? - No, tell me. To sing. In public. In front of everybody. What an idea. I wish I could sing for my Mom. Be as free as her. To each his dream. Maybe dreams disappear when they come true. You have to try. You have to try. Someone talking about happiness often has sad eyes Isn't that a sob of disappointment A string snapped under the fingers of a guitarist Nevertheless, I tell you happiness exists Not just in dreams, not just in the clouds Earth, Earth, here is its undiscovered safe harbor What would I be without you who came to meet me? What would I be but a soul in the woods, sleeping For just this hour held frozen on the face of the watch? What would I be without you but these few stammered words? Did you have nice dreams? Did you sleep well? Shall I read what I wrote? No. Isn't this silence nice? Well, what I wrote is about the silence. So I'll read it for you. Not a leaf was moving. We could hear the cicadas singing. A thud and and monotone sound coming from the sea was bringing news about the eternal sleep that awaits us. The rumor arose from the sea tough neither Marseilles nor the Estaque existed yet. It's rising today and will keep rising when we will be no more. - And... - Holy shit! We have one! - We got it. - It was a strong one. - Hell! - I got completely nervous. - Stop! Fuck! - It's big! It's big! Yes, it's big. But I saw bigger ones. Bigger, maybe. But more beautiful... Never! You cried the whole night. Oh, my beauty. My beauty. There is something in your eyes that can understand it, isn't it? - Maybe they can hear you even if you don't shout. - I doubt it. They are far away. And they will be even further away. Don't you know? The boss wants to get rid of them. They want to throw them away with the garbage, because they're useless. As if they never were really alive. - What can you do? - We should... That's what we should do. - How can I help you? - Look. I kept the key. Here. Can you imagine? Such an expedition! - You know it's impossible. - But that's what he wants. - Never! Never! - No way. You're crazy. She's crazy. He's right, you are crazy. There are limits. - You have nothing in your pants. - She thinks she's a cucaracha. Pasionaria! Pasionaria! Not cucaracha. You can write. But that's all you can do. Didn't you say the Occidental man has lost... What? His rites. If I get you right, shouldn't we help this man that doesn't accept corpses without sepultures? Isn't he right? Begin with putting all the napkins on. - Then we'll think. - What is he writing? Do not accept corpses without sepultures. Nice girl. She is a very nice girl. This way. You know... I can still hear them today. Finally dry! You scared me. It's the first time I frighten somebody. - Where are we? - In paradise! Are we dead? Arian is Dead. Long life to Ariane. As we told about the kings. A new life is beginning for you. You're talking alone now. Touch your head, it must be boiling. Where are we now, my friends? Maybe in Africa! This song! - It's what my mother used to sing. - Her mother was a singer. - Oh. Really? - Yes, a singer and a clown. The title is "You've made your bed, now you must lie in it". I know the lyrics. What do we do know? We won't grow old if we stay here. Come on, let's go. All because of his damned jars. Let's take the shutter and go to Marseilles. What is it again? Fuck! I can't stand you anymore. You can't help me, you're too selfish. We'll play tonight, I'm telling you to go get ready. No, it's over. Over. End of the line, all change please! You are impossible! Go get ready, for God's sake! You want be to get mad once again, right? I can't. I can't. - What can't you do? - Sing tonight. How can you say that? I saw you do that a dozen times. Listen, we can't keep rehearsing for 3 months. I don't know if you realize we will play tonight. Well, "play"... - I know what I mean. - And what do you mean? - What do you mean with that look. - What look? - You mean I can't do it. - Not at all. You always thought I was a bad actress. - What are you doing? - Quitting! I can't take it anymore! No, you can't do that to me. I can do it. This I can do. Come here. Be careful with the costume. - Fuck you're costume! - There's no reason to ruin it! Look at what you did. Come back, I'm begging you. - Never. - Please. You can't even direct me. I told you "interior" You can understand "interior", it's not difficult. - Wasn't I interior, last time? - Yes, but... Do it again. - Let go of me. - Come on. - Let go of me! - Here, very good. Between your tooth. Just like this, you did it! You can do it! - I'm having a nervous breakdown! - Yes, it's very good. You're doing it. Come on, do it again. Let go of me, don't you speak French? Let me go and never touch me again. Stop, stop. Pull yourself together! Mornings, evenings, nights... you keep fucking with me. - Fuck you! Fuck you! - Okay, good. You do your show all alone. Cause you are never fucking with me, maybe? - You're pathetic. - Here you are again. Shitty director with dumb ideas. My dumb ideas put food in your mouth. And I won't say everything. - Stop it. - You try me, you find me. - Don't be surprised you find me. - Listen, I'm not you're chick anymore. Look at you, seriously. How the fuck could I live with such a guy? You know what I see when I look at you? Ruins. Really, ruins. - A ruin that earns your money. - You don't earn anything! - Nothing. You don't even fuck me! - We're talking business, not the rest! The rest? Let's talk about the rest. The rest is a chicken. A carcass for the dog. That's what's left. There's nothing left. So... Goodbye. I'm leaving. I'm going to travel. I need fresh air! - Very clever. - Show us the beginning. What beginning? - Of the show. Why do they fight? - You think this was theater? - Wasn't it? - Not at all. It was real life. I lost my main actress and my wife at the same time. Is it what you liked? - Do you think she left for good? - Yes, yes. That's what people enjoy. See an execution. Death in an area. What a shame. Secret story. Trust TV. I can help you. Help me? How? Do to what? I'm ruined, desolated, lost. Have you already played? Can you sing? - Yes. - You sang at school. For your boss. In your factory. Of course. Some bullshit. Works council. - Everybody is an actor today. - I know that song by heart. No. This is enough. Can't you see we can't stand it? - We need to go home. - Yes, he's right. Go home. Seeing a man's degradation is not enjoyable. But... maybe we can help! I'm telling you it's enough, Ariane. Let's go now. All I can do now is commit suicide. - He'll commit suicide! - Can't you see he's acting? Hollywood! Hollywood! - No! - Yes. Yes, Ariane. Come on. All of us already almost drowned because of your stories. - It's true, Ariane. - It's true! My stories? So now there are my stories? What about him? And him? Martial, you're not saying anything now? You were happy we all did things for you and now you don't say a word! Where are the monsters we brought to the sea, now? In your cold hearts. You are the monsters. She is crazy. Crazy girl. Can you hear the shutter? Let's go home. Let's all go. Do you know what is in this shutter? My audience. They are all my audience. It's over. It's over now. I can't stand it anymore. I will end it, I'm ruined. The audience will attend my suicide. - Denis, what will we do if he dies? - Can't you see it's cinema? I'm fed up with you. I'm going out of here. Lola, come with me. Denis! - Denis, stop. - No, I'm fed up. I swear, I can't. She wants to help everybody! - Don't you fucking have a heart? - What? Me, heartless? You're saying so, Martial? That's a good one. Tell me, how long have I been feeding you? You're our guard but there's nothing to guard! We almost died for you! For your Octavo, your In?s! Your little things! My balls! I'm heartless?! - That's the best one. - You are being unjust. - You're starting too. - Let her sing if she wants to. Why wouldn't she have the right to sing? Men can only torment us. Torment! Torment! Torment! - I don't torment you. - That's the only thing you do! - Here we go again. - Yes. - Don't you start too! - No problem. What an idiot you are. Don't cry, it's not worth it. - What can I do? - Go talk to him. Hold him in your arm. Whisper something to his ear. Do you think so? Tell him... "Denis, darling..." "Denis, just once." "Let me sing, just once." Tell him you want to sing for him. His heart will be upside down. He will be easy to handle. Tell him... "My Denis, let the two of us have a deal." "A chance. Just one. The last one." Etc, etc... Do you understand? Yeah... - Do you think it will work? - Of course! You must negotiate in life. But... But? You need to be strong and sing well. Nobody can do that for you. Especially me. You need to please them. They must want to hear more of it. Only you can do that, pretty. Only you. Only you know if you are capable of it. - I can try. - You can't try. You must succeed. Come on. Call him. "Denis..." Denis! Denis! Wait! Denis! Wait for me! Denis! Wait for me! What is it again? Let me sing once. Just once. You always gamble your life on a single bet. It's like trains passing by and you have to jump aboard. They won't be stopping. Ladies and Gentlemen Here is what my mother One day foretold "You will end up in a morgue" "In an asylum or on a scaffold" "Yeah, keep talking, These are only words" "Let me tell you You won't have my skin" "How I will end up?
