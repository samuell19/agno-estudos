Central Prague film rentals presents Don't... Don't Look Behind... Don't Look Behind You... Don't Look Behind You, We're Being Followed by a Horse. The race is on! Villenueve in the lead with number 12. Next is 26, Laffit; and after him number 11, Schekter. Arnoux, number 16, is heading into fifth place behind Lauda. I call that a rocket launch. - Did you see Fiti? There's a devil. - But the king of the track is my Jody. Now comes the tricky part, a parabolic turn. Laffit tries to overtake Villenueve... - We're heading for victory. - Yeah, the consolation prize. The only way to overtake Fiti is to shoot him. Jody's the man who can do it! - Ha, don't make me laugh! - What? Mummy! - Mummy! - Dad has a heavy workload. Can you hear him? He's playing Dvorak. With Your Golf Clubs On A Business Trip An Idyll for Tense Nerves Watch it! Laffit's in serious trouble... but he pulls through. Man! He closed the gap! Jodi cheated! He pushed Fiti off the track! Jodi has to score points. Clear disqualification! Where are the judges? Cheats! Tough luck! You've got to cheat to win. You're on the verge of losing. - You don't know how to drive. - Don't you dare say that! - Bullshit! - Damn you! What did I ask you? Not to fight, at least not in the house. - And what's this? - Grand Prix of Italy. And what sort of nonsense is that? A couple of loonies want to race whatever the risks. They can't wait to be scraped up with a shovel. You find this fun. You're wasting your time. Go practice on the violins. Music ennobles. The old Czech masters. They held races in their heads. It's the fuses again. Hello. I'm sorry. I'm Rozkoshna, the new neighbor. Excuse me. My vacuum cleaner burned out. Skorzhepa. Yes. I understand. Yes, yes. Emergency alert. Yeah. As if it wasn't already enough. First in Command. Where shall I go? Yeah. Tonik...it's at the 13 kilometer distance marker. Mihule, we knew it must be you! Why didn't you come? The stadium was boiling hot. - We're grounded. - Wasting away like Dalibor in the tower. - Do you want something to eat? - No. What do you say about the go-cart? - What go-cart? - Unfold the airplane. (Dalibor of Kozojedy: a Robin Hood-like hero for the Czechs) "This cart can be yours." That's super! A dream! The original brand! Skorzhepovy brothers from 6B on the Phantom. Sweepstakes Lottery. More information inside. - Shall we? - It's closed. A pity we have to wait. Mihule. Where are you going? We've been here an hour already. - Could it be some kind of scam? - What sort of scam? - With the go-cart. - Skorzhepovy! The bell's ringing. - Hello. - Hello. You're familiar with the right-angled triangle. What you don't know, but will know after today... ...is Pythagoras' theorem. Who was Pythagoras? A Greek mathematician who first... ...showed the relation of the hypotenuse to the two legs. Skorzhepovy, I'm watching you. What are the legs? The legs are the short sides of a right triangle. The sum of the two remaining angles equals 90 degrees. It follows that the sum of all the angles is 180 degrees. (Let's go to the lavatory.) The hypotenuse... What is it Skorzhepovy? Comrade teacher... Run... now, where was I? Oh, the hypotenuse. She's already coming. Mihula, could we really win? - How much is one ticket? - Only 10 kilos of waste paper. Deliver the paper and get the ticket. When the draw takes place, they only need to draw your number... ...and the go-cart can be yours. - And if they don't draw ours? - There are other prizes. We're not interested in them. And neither does school interest you, right? Oh, I see, Skorzhepovy. A well-known team. Clear off! - So what do you need here? - Waste paper. We wanted to bring honor to the school and the Pioneers. It was meant to be a surprise, Comrade Director. Ah, a surprise. So I may not know about it? It was to be somehow... No. Even if it's to honor the school, you can't neglect your lessons. Go to class! What did you say, Mihule? - The more tickets you get, the better your chance. - Aha. - Hi Dad. - Hello. -Hello. - 100 should be enough. - 100 tickets? That's a ton of paper. Where will we get it? You could start here! - When is the draw? - On Pioneers' Day. - Time is running out. - Come on. Fellows, have you gone mad? Don't tell anyone! Clearly! You can't imagine what they'll do for my pretty eyes, Yevgen. Come on, Peter! Thinking to enlarge your family? Perhaps a sister? No, the Green Phantom. What? Come! We're going! Run! It weighs 60 kilos. So choose, boys. Not so slow, just take one. We'll be coming back. I know...wait. Here there's a lot, I promise. Pass to me! Jesus Maria! Where are you Skorzhepovy? We're here since 2:00. - Another time! - We're collecting paper. It's Mum! What will we tell her, brother? Maybe she didn't see us. If Dad finds out, he'll do a somersault. Bad luck. Horizon's clear! - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Good bye. - Good bye. Come again. - Hello. - Hello. Excuse me. That girl, what's she up to? I don't know, but she was asking how many tickets you have. Is she also collecting? Were these really discarded? Did you take them off a desk? No. The guard said we could take them along with the rest. Is she normal, that girl? Why would she need a go-cart? I always come here to cheer up... ...just to look. Then I'm happy again. Green Phantom! But where will we keep her? She can't stand out in the rain! - It can't be the house. - In the shed. First-class shed. I see it already, man. Posters and garlands... ...a shelf for the trophies. Can't you just see it, brother? - Yeah. More hard labour. - What labour? It will all be fun. Damn! Come, help me. Come on! Lift it up! Ow! - What? - I twisted my back. Tonik, it seems odd. Why are they carting waste paper around? Maybe they want to be first in their class. If so, why did they hide from me? They're up to something again. Have you noticed they don't even fight? Very suspicious. Don't read the paper all the time. - Boys, supper's ready! - Yeah. We're coming. Dude, I can't get out of the tub. - Wait. - Ow! Wait, hold on. I'll smear you with the stuff Mum puts on her legs. Why don't you eat? I'm only thirsty. Did something happen to him? Do you have fever? Let's see. What could happen? How are you sitting? Why don't you sit straight? I can't. At school they say it'll only last until tomorrow. Let's go. We still have to learn Neruda. You see...to learn...Neruda. Like lions, we pound on the bars,... ...like lions trapped in a cage. Ow! Don't press so hard. I can't press hard. Look at my blisters! Like lions, we pound on the bars... ...like lions trapped in a cage. - And we'll break it down - Ow! Have you seen my knitting magazine? The most recent issue. Where could it have gone? "The Signal". There's no paper in the house for kindling. Children, where did you hide my... What did I say? All my French oil used up! We must catch them in the act! Help me wake him! Hi pal. You're crooked. Before the draw takes place, we'll celebrate my funeral. It's a fact. We can't do it alone. But you can't just cop out! The only option is to get the class involved. How do you plan to make them work for you? Declare an auction. Then we have another interesting thing here. A pair of fish for breeding. Opening price is 15 kilos. Who will give more? Twenty... twenty kilos is our first bid. Twenty kilos, the second, twenty kilos for the third time. They're yours. Thanks. "Mexico's Fans" and "Deserts and Prairies". Perfect condition! - Wait, first the poster. - Right. Vera Spinarová with her handwritten signature. Starting price...how much can I say? It's your specialty! Jesus Maria! Isn't this crazy? To trade the Spinar for waste paper? - What are they collecting for? - The campaign "Save our forests". You can tell your grandma that, Mihule! I know why! - They want to win a go-cart. - How do you figure it out? I collected too, and for five kilos I got this. Show me. Let's swap, Yevgeny. I don't want to. You want to compete as well? - Why not? - You have no chance against them, Yevgen. Show me. 0001... that number could be the winner. Yevgeny, if you're a friend, don't spoil it for them. We'll give you this paper weight with snow inside. No. - Yevgen, I'll add my amulet. - Show me. Take it! Ah, the Skorzhepovy boys... ...I'll tell your dad how hard you work! He'll be glad! - It's better not to. - It's meant as a surprise. Come on, I can add to your load. Come on. Surely each of us dreams... ...to be quicker than Time. He who wants that... ...however will need... ...four fast wheels beneath... ...and a few horsepower... ...and know how to drive a go-cart. He who wants that... ...however will need... ...a few horsepower. We want that... ...we the people... ...will be masters of Time... ...and fly like an arrow! We want that... ...as Time will not wait. We want that... ...to be quicker. We want that... ...as Time, will not wait. To be quicker than Time... ...each of us dreams about it. Who wants that... ...however will need... ...to be quicker than Time! Comrades! Little does the public suspect that in this depot... ...which looks like a shed... ...are two new, unknown Formula 1 champions... ...preparing to take the title with this new brand of car... ...a new brand. Now pay attention! - Cool! Right? - Yeah. I can see her already. It will be great. What are you wearing? A fireproof mask. When I sit there for the first time... You mean to say when WE first sit there... Hang on there! We break our backs while she gets herself a car. Yeah, just think if we had one! Hello. Hello, Mr. Skorzhepa, I was waiting for you. I looked to see whose it might be. Me too. - I mean the car. - But I meant the shed. - It's nobody's. - Nobody's? It was built by the last owner. - You bought this? - Well, -hm. Mr. Skorzhepa, you're an expert. Could you try it for me? Mr. Skorzhepa... We don't get the whole shed. How's that? Why did she ask about the shed? She needs a garage. It handles well, right? Which day do you think the traffic is worst? The weekend, right? At the weekend the streets are jammed. Cars shove each other, you need wings. For losing fenders the worst day is today, Thursday. Really? The first principle of driving is to overtake everything. For example, I have to see... ...if I can go around that tram or need to crawl along behind. Why's he blowing the whistle? I think, somehow, the tram had the right-of-way. Sir, I have never seen a worse traffic pirate than you. Tonik, what the hell are you doing? It's an occupational illness. When I'm at the wheel, I think I'm in the ambulance. Hello. Don't they play anything else? Your food's in the oven. We're in for a heatwave, huh? Don't worry, I know everything. Play with two voices. We'll pretend we're not listening. I don't know how. - We won't buy the car. - No. - Just out of interest, what's it worth? - It's worthless. Now begins what all dads most dread. "In fact, the car is a mobile coffin." Don't you think I might want to ride at times? My legs get worn out. Did you know the woman is divorced? Her ex-husband already left her in Košice. Quit the screeching and go for a walk. - Hi, guys. - Hi. -Hi. Would you like a drink? I can see you have a lot on your minds. We didn't finish with the shed. Now our neighbor's taking it for her car. But why? Isn't your dad supervisor of the tenants? If he knew what we were up to... ...you'd want to take a first aid course. You know what? I'd put a up a sign... ...DANGER - NO ENTRY. And I'd dangle this spider, in front of the window. Let's see, from Yevgen? He's sucking up to me. To make things okay again. - You really don't want a drink? - No. Bye then, I've got to learn the tributaries of the Elbe. Bye. Boys! Come wash and go to bed. Someone's in the shed. Boys! I'm waiting for you to explain. - We'll clear it away tomorrow. - To avoid an argument. - When is the lottery? - The day after tomorrow. On Pioneers' Day. What if you, God forbid, really do win the go-cart? Well, until such time, the shed waits. Then the House Council decides. Yeah, Mum, that would be super! Tomorrow we'll meet at the post office. There's a bunch of old newspapers. Mum, what do we say to Dad? Nothing. Only listen to him playing Dvorak. - Guys, hello. - Hi, Mihule. We've got waste paper! The cart will be ours! It will get us lots of tickets. Long live the Formula-1 racers! - See you! - Bye! 15, 20, 24. Okay? - Thank you! - Ahh, there's one left. You may have it, as a gift from me. Touch wood! May it bring you luck! Which one? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Bye! This suits us well... ...we the people. To be the masters of Time... ...to fly like an arrow. This suits us well... ...Time does not wait. It suits us well... ...Time will not wait. It suits us well... ...Time will not wait. It suits us well... ...we the people. To be the masters of Time... ...to fly like an arrow. - So kids, good morning. - Good morning! - Hush. What does hush mean? - Hush! Correct! Pay attention children. Good fortune rains on us! Luck spills on us. And the moment we've been waiting for has arrived! - The big waste paper draw...called? - Lottery! Correct, kids! Now we'll see who gets the lucky number! I hope the lucky winners are among us ! Let's see! So are you ready? The first prize is won by the holder of number...please. Number 14910. Perfect! - I don't have it. - Neither do I. It can't be possible. Look properly! - Here, please! - So, come claim your prize! Formula-1 racer! First prize! And the drum is already turning for the second win! - It's 21163. - Number 21163. Is this lucky winner present? Here! - That's a pity. (girl in crowd) - So we have TWO lucky winners! It will be a double surprise! You're sure to have a lot of good times with him. And the drum's turning for the third prize! Don't look back. Pretend that we don't see him. Wow, guys! Your horse is following you! He probably thinks you're his mum! Don't poke fun at our bad luck! Stop, maybe he'll go on past. It would be best to skip violin lesson. What are we going to do now? We can't go home. Imagine us in the rodeo. Our only choice... to escape! Psst. He's listening. Do you think he knows we're talking about him? I seriously doubt it. Unless we...hide him in the shed for the night. By morning, we might think of something. Maybe it just seems to me that I'm seeing what I think I see.. We've won him instead of the go-cart. Take this beast away immediately. - And if they're not there anymore? - I don't care! I don't want to hear more. Prizes are given without parents' consent. We categorically refuse it. - We'll try to find Oloyshek. - What Oloyshek? - The one who won the go-cart. - Maybe he'll exchange it. For a horse? Dreamer. You're going... now go. Go on...away from here. - He's probably hungry. - Run for some milk. We'll need 5 liters! Come with me. Don't tell why! This will be my death! Why are you always closing it? To keep the moths out. Are the boys already asleep? What's wrong with them? Nothing. What's that? Probably cats mating. Is there something interesting on TV? What's going on here? It sounded like whinnying. - We have a horse. - No! Yes! - Where? - In the shed. What shed? Let them explain themselves. He wants us to stay with him. We thought we could keep him quiet. You decorated nicely here, boys. But it's so hard here. He'll have swollen feet in the morning. He needs a litter, a little straw. Straw? In the city? At night? I told you to take him away. Straw, I know where to go. - Where? - At the barriers. - Where are you going with the wagon? - To the stadium. Can't you talk to them? It's not enough when I tell them. Huh? Two bales should be enough. What now, you'll make thieves of my children! - Hello, Mrs. Skorzhepova. - Hello. I hope there will be no repeat of last night. - My husband's in the stable. - He's grooming. What? You surely don't intend to keep the monster here? Only until we sell him to buy ourselves a go-cart. You're not doing this to me out of spite, are you? Just because I said I would need the shed. Fate intervened. Mrs. Skorzhepova, I'm submitting my application in writing. Here you are. I hope you heard everything. Things don't happen that fast. Not before the meeting of Council tenants. What meeting? This farm animal called Ferdo must go. Better a stranger's car than a horse. It's said that if you give a name to a beast, you'll never part with it. What do you mean by that? Nothing, except that you called him Ferdo. If I call all the riding clubs, so... Half past seven! Where's your schoolbag? Peter will explain to the teacher. How so? He can't stay here alone. To school now, march! Both of you. All three of you. What? How so? Last night I thought of something... a certain idea. Where are you going with the mustang? To school! Just a moment! Dear brothers Skorzhepovy... ...I'm pleased whenever pupils bring honor to our school. I heard how your extracurricular activities... ...won you public honors. What did they get? A horse, Comrade Director. A horse. Well that's great, a wonderful surprise, right? Of course you'll want to show him to the other pupils. - Our pleasure Sir. He's downstairs. - Tied up. What? How am I supposed to understand this? We wanted to ask if... ...while we had lessons, he could be on the school playground. - Inside the fence. He could graze there. - And go for a run. If a horse doesn't get to run, it will become feeble-minded. What...aha. Well, then...hm...since he's already down there, right? Colleagues, I'm giving you full responsibility. Go to class, children, to class. Pupil Ruzhichka, to the Director. Pupil Ruzhichka to the director! - He's beautiful. - Look at his mane! Comrade Teacher, Mihule said the horse sees us 8 times larger than life. Children, stay away from behind the horse. It has an amazing memory. At the circus I saw a horse that could count. Boys, you could train him and ride him around the whole world. Better if he played in a movie. Ferdo, the Star of the Silver Canvas. You could work as cowboys. May I give him sugar? You may. Hold the cubes like this on your outstretched palm. Feel how velvety. Look at Regina. Sucking up to them. Anyway, they won him on my ticket. Look, that idiot again!. Pavel, come here! Hide here and play. Play! Ferdo is musical. No one can tell me that an animal has no soul. Ferdo... Well you see. - Hello. - Hello. Who left him out? He opened himself. Go to your stable! Go! Gentlemen, I have a buyer. You can call this number. Go on. Why me? It's their horse, isn't it? Do you want to sell it or not? Peter, go call. If we feed him a while, we'll get more for him. How much will you ask for? We should first inquire as to how much a horse is worth. Horse number 1, Futuritski. Jockey, Kubat, weight 56. Horse number 2, Lucifer. Jockey, Dolejší, weight 57. Horse number 3, Herald. Jockey, Koubek Stanislav, weight 57. Horse number 4, Iroqouis. Jockey, Minarzhik, weight 57. Horse number 5, Vita. Jockey, Abraham, weight 56. Horse number 6, Sara. Jockey, Koštál, weight 56. So, guys, who do you think will win? I don't know, but on the streets they're discussing a favourite. The seventh trots just like our Ferdo. You know what, boys? Here you are. Knock on wood. - Take it. Place a bet with five crowns. - Thank you. -Thanks. Horse number 12, Dukát. Jockey, Wurm, weight 56. Run! Run! Bravo! Bravo! Look, excellent. Bravo. Dad, we won! As far as I can remember, you meant to call Mr. Kuzhli. Well, we completely forgot. Yeah, guys? Yeah. We forgot. You don't play anymore. Listen, Tonik, what are you thinking about doing with the horse? Nothing. He's...well...consuming us. We'll need to take from our savings. Imagine the fee one must pay for a horse if one pays a thousand for a dog. No way! There's no fee for having a horse. The city authorities didn't reckon with its residents owning horses. So you already inquired. Tony, it won't work. Look now... ...if you don't call that number tomorrow, I'll sell your cello. It seems to me we're working this wagon to death. What do you make of this? Still warm from the oven. Ferdo nicks. Jesus Maria! I had bread rolls in my bag. Where are the rolls? Who took them? And this was bread. Where's that beast? Madam, Ferdo wouldn't do something like that. - He's not here. - Where is he? - You left the gate open! - I'm always on my guard for him. The rolls... are they all here? Five... - Did you see a horse? - I did! - Where did he go? - I think to the circus. GUESTHOUSE Two Hearts Jesus Maria. I just saw a white mouse... and now this. You like it? So take it. What's the deal? Stealing bread, wandering off and freaking drunkards? Don't bullshit me. I'm not impressed. The woman's dangerous. Be on your guard, Ferdo. Come. Donuts, flapjacks! Bakery Skorzhepovy Brothers. - See who it is. - One crown for each. Flapjacks! The original product, Bakery Skorzhepovy Brothers! Shut up! I'm in a foul mood. What did he say? That you're dung beetles? You only dare take on the weak! Pavel, get him back! - You just watch him? - We can't both take him on. Let go! Now I can! Come on, you... Well, I'll tell you this... I won't stand for it any longer! Come here. Show me. Now... ...well, it will be a nice monocle. That's the last favour I'll do for that horse. - This will help. - Ow! It hurts. Are you really not talking to each other? - If he's stubborn, I am too. - Ferdo will be sold. Not without my agreement. He's half mine! You can't be without Ferdo, can you? Mmm. Ferdo can't be without me! Look, I've got a lot to do! Don't be silly! He's really getting you down! The horse? Never! Ferdo! Ow... Pavel! Pavel, come on. Look! BARGAIN SALE Great Offer - Hello. - Hello. Beautiful car, right? Maybe your parents wonder what to buy for your graduation. Your dad earns well, doesn't he? - We can buy it ourselves! - Really? We're giving a discount. Oloyshek would prefer chess. Maybe we should ask at home? Madam, would you let us try it? Well now...if you're serious about buying. So, how is it? It's a great feeling, but I don't know if... We won't argue. We'll toss! Heads, gets the go-cart. Toss! Toss yourself. - Heads! - Um. It didn't spin well. Tails... meaning horse. But...the one who gets it will be lending it. Final toss, for a peaceful settlement. I must write down your address. - The go-cart 31 times. - And the horse 28 times. Um? So then, the go-cart? Look, brother. - I have an invoice for the oats. - I'm not here on duty. - Hello. - Hi. - Is there a complaint about the horse? - No. Look, Tonik, I have a personal interest... ...in concluding this whole business. It's good you've come. You can hang this up. - Is it about Ferdo? - I guess. I don't know. Our neighbor wrote a complaint to the police? What makes you think that? Comrade is here on his own. Nothing like this has happened to me before. I've shown good will until now, but if it means war, then it's war. All the flowers are nibbled off. Look, Comrade Captain. This was such a beautiful begonia. You know who ruined it? We'll be happy to pay you. It's not about compensation, but the principle. I demand a lasting solution. It's not about a principle, but a shed. Whoever heard of a horse in the house? Do you have permission? Ask to see it. Can you tell her that for a horse nothing is required? Another thing needed is the neighbors' consent. Ferdo does not bother anyone. You can ask! It's enough if one is against. That one is me! It can't stay! He'll stay. I'm prepared to file a petition in the courts. - I'll go even higher. - Enough! That's enough. So what remains? Mutual destruction... or settlement? I'll give you one week. Is that clear? Pavel. It's all over. (Calling First in Command, Hello) The number's by the phone. Go and dial it. - Peter, lock up, please. - (Please respond). (Do you hear, First in Command?) First in Command, hello. "The defect, for this reason, becomes a mere episode... ...on the long road to improvement". "Over the past weekend, we have seen... ...except in the fields, where harvesting continues... ...no let-up in the intense work in the mines of the Ostrava-Karviná district. Over 2,000 miners set their sights on..." He should by now have eaten, right? It's somehow too quiet. I'm not going. Peter, come on, we'll take some water. - Guys, he's not here. - What, how? The shed is empty. He knew everything... and left on his own! He can open it, but shut it after him? It was latched on the outside. That means somebody did it. Run and look around! - Can't you say hello? - Hello. - What happened? - And don't you know? Where's our Ferdo? Don't pretend! Now you got your way! Let me see now! This time we call the police. It won't be necessary. - I have to tell you something. - I must also talk to you. What now? Well, Tonik had an accident. Boys, wait. Not a word about Ferdo to Dad. You know how it weighs on him. - Do you hear? Everything's fine, right? - Oh yeah. Well, then we can go. - Hi Dad. -Hello. - Hello. -Tonik. They wrote about you in the Black Chronicle. "From the police logbook... ...In a collision of an ambulance with a crane... ...the only one injured was Antonin S., driver of the ambulance." Look. If you had raced the Phantom, it would be at least half a page. Do you need anything, books or slippers... ...actually only the left one. What is it, Dad? Something of yours? Yes, let me have it here. It's from the factory council... instead of a plaster. All this humbug! Open the drawer. Give me the envelope. I got this from the insurance, for my broken leg and rib. - Do you know what to do with it, boys? - No. I'm buying Ferdo from you. But Dad, we can't take it! Then he'll not end up in the hands of a stranger. - And you'll not come out short. - Ferdo is all of ours, yours too. It's a pity you didn't bring him along. He asked for you! Hardly appropriate on such an occasion... Boys, wait outside, please. - Bye. - I'll come. Tonik, does it hurt you much? - I guess I know who stole him. - Who? The girl with the ponytail. - You think so? - Yeah. We saw her at the collection point, and again at the draw and at school. - I saw her by the shed. - Really? Surely each of us dreams... ...to be quicker than Time. He who wants that... ...however will need... ...a few horsepower... ...someone to say "Achieve your goal!" Know to strike for gold. He who wants that... ...however will need... Someone to say "Achieve your goal!" We want that... ...we the people... ...will be masters of Time... ...and fly like an arrow! We want that... ...we the people... We want that... ...to be quicker than Time. We want that... ...as Time, will not wait. Our friend with the mane... ...loves affectionate words. Who wants to follow... ...we want that... ...our friend with the mane. We want that... ...we the people... ...to be quicker than Time. ...and fly like an arrow! We want that... ...as Time, will not wait. We want that... ...to be quicker than an arrow. - Hello. - Hello. I'm here about the stallion. - Do you know something about him? - Well, I know everything about horses. You guys are right. He would be miserable in the city. Horses need to run free in nature. But we do not have him anymore. You called for me to come. If he were here, we wouldn't sell him anyway. - Somebody stole him. - Some girl. Damn. - Hello. - Hello. -Now, I'm here! Well, because of the go-cart. You say she has a horse on her T-shirt? - And she doesn't wear such blue pants? - Jeans. - I ought to know about that, but... - Where is she? If I'm not mistaken, she's now at her violin lesson... ...Folk Art School. - Our prey. Let's get going! - Wait! No confrontation. She'll deny everything. She hasn't seen us. If she does she'll move Ferdo. - Hi, boys, what are you doing here? - Come here. Let's go. She doesn't know you, go closer. Quicker. Come on. Look! She's made everything ready for a horse. Come on, Pavel! - Ferdo! - Ferdo! Come on. Do you see this? I think I'm going crazy! What are you doing here? And who let you in? - Just a moment! Give us Ferdo! - What Ferdo? - Our horse. Come on, where is he? - How should I know? Don't pretend. We saw you! You give him at once or... Please, take him if you find him here. Don't say you didn't want to steal him. And what's this? I was counting on winning him in the lottery... ...so I prepared this for him. - So you wanted to win the horse? I made everything ready, but all for nothing. I couldn't have guessed it. Grandpa! - Hello. - Hello. These are the boys who won instead of me. I know...we already met. Come... come now. Do you know, boys, what I had in mind? I'll ask at the club if they can help us find him. That's Mihule, our friend. Do you have any leftover tickets? And the one from Yevgeny? Why? Something came up. Leave it to me. Mr. Skorzhepa, can you hear me? I need to tell you something important. You think I'm involved with the disappearance of that... horse? Let's not bring that up again. But please, you know I'm pursuing the matter like crazy! Pepa comes to report to me twice a day. What Pepa? Your acquaintance in the police. You know, I don't want the shed anymore. And I take back my request. I did not mean it. - People sometimes do stupid things. - She doesn't want the shed. Did you say something? No, no, no, nothing. It's just that my wife wants to say she's sorry. But why, pray tell? We were just kidding. No Smoking! Come here, Mihule. It's good you came! Help me with this otter! Who did this to you? Ah, nothing...I fell on the stairs. Well, of course... Here, take this ticket. What ticket? 0001. From the boys. It can't win any more. So why do they have it? This is proof that Ferdo does not belong to you. What do you mean? You know very well where that horse is. Look, Mihule, cut the crap. You don't think I stole Ferdo? I also don't think your grandmother bit you. Evgeny, if the horse is returned by tomorrow, this will remain between us. This race decides who will be this year's world champion. So far, Jody Scheckter in his Ferrari has 44 points. In second place is Jacques Laffit, with 8 points less. Then comes Jones with 34 points, Villenueve with 32 points... This thing's a genius... ...that any dummy can handle. Give it here. Let's try it. You can adjust the viewfinder, for example, by focusing out the window. Not this, that's the trigger. Let it be for now, tomorrow's another day. - Do you see anything? - It's blurry. Wait, you have to close one eye. What do you see? Ferdo! Yeah, Ferdo! Ferdo! Ferdazhnik! Ferdo, finally! We're so glad our lost son returns! Look at his scarred neck. He was tied. You poor thing - to suffer. Don't worry, Ferdo, it'll be okay now. Hi guys. I just wanted to call you. I have a new lead we can follow up. - Actually, searching... - for Ferdo... - is no longer necessary. What? Why not? Because he's out there grazing! - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Why should he not like it here? So... don't you want to leave him here? We were going to ask you. - There's enough space for you too. - You can make a summer flat here. Well, just see, all the problems are solved. Guys, do you know that a new competition is announced? [Peter:] What's the first prize? Hang-glider! [Pavel] And we'll win a giraffe instead!
