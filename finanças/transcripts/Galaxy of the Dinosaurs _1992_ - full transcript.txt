[pages flipping] [Desert wind blows] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Hello? Hello? Hey, you guys there? Yes Graft, we're all here and just about ready to hit the planet. Are you sure you can not bring it back or something? No thanks Morda. I packed my lunch today Captain Kronik? Yes. I got the ship as close as we can get it without being getting being detected. Just say when. I don't see why we just don't land on the planet. If we get too close, their satellites will pick us up. Yeah, and these paranoid people would send missiles all over the planet. Besides, I don't think planet earth is ready for a visit from outer space. Is it really worth it then? You bet your black hole is worth it. I am hungry. There are plenty of planets to choose from, Benj, we better food even, we can wait to even get back to Zairox, it's not that far. Ha, Doctor Forband, where's your sense of adventure? Yes, and did you that no one in the whole universe can cook a meat substance as fast as anyone on Earth? Professor Geting, I don't care how fast they can cook it, I just don't trust them. I mean, have you ever seen the ruler of their food empire? with that red hair and that white face and that ugly yellow suit? I just don't trust 'em. I don't care what they wear, as long as they can cook it, I can eat it. Benj, you can eat anything, and usually do. Ha, ha, ha. I am about to release the shuttle. I'm gonna go ahead and glide the shuttle through that big hole in the Earth's ozone layer, then I'll go ahead and transmit you from there and now bounce the shuttle back to the ship. Ah, hopefully I don't just think it's just another clump of space junk bouncing off their atmosphere. Everybody locked in and connected? We're all set and ready to go, Graft. Releasing the shuttle. Save room for desert. And away we go. Our golden magnets are pulling us in. [ENGINE REVS] Uh-oh... What's wrong? These coordinates... they're all wrong. We're nowhere near Earth, we're not even in the same solar system. Where are we then? Ever hear of the planet... Gergon? Never in my life have I heard of the planet Gergon. Are you sure about this, Graft? The only thing I'm sure about is you're heading for a dinner date on an unknown planet. [SIGNAL DISTORTIONS] Oh, that's not good. [YELLING] Graft, what's going on? Not only did someone mess with the coordinates they've also programmed the ship to self destruct. Graft, get out of there. Jump on the other shuttle and get off the ship before it blows. You think he made it? I don't think he had time. That means we're lost. We're stuck in that planet's gravitational pull. We'll burn up like a shooting star! Always the cheerful one, Forband... Graft! Barely made it. Are you all right? Made it to the shuttle. But the blast ripped a hole in the engine... I am just floating, no control. Can't you transmit yourself to the shuttle? I did manage to set your coordinates before the ship went down. You're all safe. On your way to an unknown planet, but safe. What about you? I'll try to brighten your sky with a beautiful streak of light. Maybe someone will make a wish on me. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] We've hit the atmosphere! This is it. Everybody hold tight. No, duh! [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [ELECTRONIC BUZZ] Everybody okay? Yeah man. Yeah. Where's Benj? [WHOOSHING] [WHOOSHING INTENSIFIES] Ouch! You materialized in the air. Benj, are you all right? Maybe he's dead! Benj, speak to me, Benj. I meant to do that. Hey, where are you guys going? I'm hurt, I could have been killed. Where's my sympathy? Morda, I need mouth to mouth. I can't breathe... Help me. Help me... [IMITATES CHOKING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Let's stop here and take a rest. I'm hungry... Huh, that's a shock. I don't think we'll find anything around here. Lots of vegetation but no signs of animal life yet. No insects either? That's odd. That's good, because I hate bugs. You're an assistant to Professor Geting and you hate insects? He takes care of the insects, I stay with the plants, he can deal with those little creepy things with long legs that crawl in your ears at night and lay eggs. Morda, please, even I'm getting the creeps. I'm not going any further. Am so hungry, I could eat a whole nest of insects, larva and all. Oh, you are sick. Geting, there's a line of trees over there, you think we'll find food? I'd say we got a better chance over there than in this parched field. Oh, there has to be some sort of vegetation to eat? BENJ: Vegetation? I was all set on a thick and greasy meat disk slapped with a slab of coagulated milk product. [YELLING] You're always whining! We're stuck on this planet and the sooner you realize that, the better, for all of us, 'cause we're not getting off. Let's go find something to eat. [SINISETR MUSIC] It's time for a little game... [LAUGHS WICKEDLY] Hey guys, here's the other bag. Benj, you idiot, I thought you were supposed to be carrying this. I was... excuse me for falling out of the sky. [LAUGHS] Well Geting, how about it? Looks as good as any. Look around for nuts, berries, any kinda vegetation. But don't eat it. It could be poisonous. Bring them to Professor Geting and myself for analysis. BENJ: Over here. I'll check it out, you look over there. Okay. Am I gonna die? [ROARING] [SCREAMING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING IN PAIN] It's safe. Huh? He said they're safe, you can stop whining now. It's a good thing these things are safe 'cause they seem to be the only thing around here to eat. Yeah, I didn't find anything either. Leave it to Benj to sniff out food. What about Morda? I don't know, she's probably... [MORDA SCREAMING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Morda! GETING: Let's try this way. Morda! Morda! It's Morda, guys. Morda, please be alive. She's alive guys, in shock, but alive. Good. We're not alone anymore. [SHOCK CHORD] Don't hit me, don't hit me. Get up and stop your whining. [MORDA GASPING] How is she? She'll live. Get the bags. [ANIMAL GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] [BENJ SCREAMING] Don't worry, Morda, you're okay now. That's right, you'll be alright now. Nothing will hurt you. [BENJ SCREAMING] Except maybe that. [DINOSAUR ROARS] [SCREAMING] [DINOSAUR ROARING] [DINOSAUR ROARING] [ANIMAL GRUNTING] FORBAND: Come to papa... Are you sure these things are safe? Of course not, the gauge is programmed for analysis, not guesswork. Yes, so was the Odyssey, now it's nothing but debris. Shut up, Forband, you are about bad as Benj, at least he's not whining now. He'd be happy with a bowl of crap in front of his face just long as he's eating. I think they're delicious, They remind me of that little cafe on the planet Mobias. Was that the one where you got really drunk and you started taking off all your clothes? And then you took that bottle of Moon dust and you started putting it all over your-- Yes that one! How do you like them, Captain? Oh, they make my tongue feel funny. I was gonna say the same thing. Yeah, my tongue tickles too. Wait, wait a minute, I wanna hear more about Morda taking all her clothes off... Stop it Benj. You know, the sky looks funny too. Yeah, it's throbbing. Look at it. Wow! It's so pretty. Like big fluffy flowers. I want to pluck one. Those aren't clouds... those are fetuses... little babies. Little baby clouds. [GIGGLES] Hey, I think these sprouts are starting to affect us. I think they have some sort of hallucina... Ah, the hell with it, they'e gettin' us kind of buzzed, aren't they? These are poison, I told you that they were. Oh, man, but they do make you feel good. Umm... I'm goin' to find some more of these little magical sprouts. I'm gonna go get some more of them magical sprout things, guys. [LAUGHING] Bye. Here, magical sprouty things! Hey, what're you doing? I can't see two fingers in front of my face... Oh, yeah I can. [ANIMAL GRUNTING] You're Big Tinker berry, aren't you? [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] FORBAND: Going for a little ride, are we? Hey this is fun! Hey guys, look at me, I'm flying! We missed the bus, man. [LAUGHING] See ya! Send us a postcard. [LAUGHING] FORBAND: Are we there yet? Hey, is this your home? Hey, I can't go in there, I don't even know your name. [LAUGHING] GETING: Bye, Stewie... see you in St. Louie! Hey, take that man out of your mouth. Yeah, you don't know where he's been. [LAUGHING] [DINOSAUR GRUNTING] FORBAND: It's dark in here, forget to pay the electric bill? Hey, that hurts. [BONES CRACKING] [SOMBER MUSIC} [SNORING] [SNORING] [SNORING] [SNORING] [SNORING] [SNORING] [BENJ MUMBLING] What? Is it time for school already? Oh. Everyone alright? Oh, man, my head! I had the worst dream that Doctor Forband was eaten by this huge creature with the biggest teeth that I've ever seen. Funny, I had the same kinda night time manifestation in my sleep as well. Me too. Not me. I dreamt that Morda was naked and dancing on top of me. Shut up. Oww. Why you have to be so rough? That hurts. I bruise easily. [SAD MUSIC] Look, over there. So it wasn't a dream. Oh... [MORDA CRYING] It's okay, Benj. No, it's not. He owes me money. Look awfully big. Yeah. [ANIMALS GRUNTING] Those look a lot better. Yeah. [SPEAR STABS DINOSAUR] [DINOSAURS GRUNTING] [SPEAR STABS DINOSAUR] I think I'm gonna be sick. [ROARING] [SCREAMING] Come on, let's go! [ROARING] [GRUNTS] Good shot, Morda, now stand back. [LASER BEAM FIRES] It worked. Come on. What was that? I tore apart the gauge and made a few minor adjustments and lo and behold I made a laser gun. That's incredible. Corny and predictable, but still incredible. Where is Benj? Hey, you guys, don't leave me down here. Alright. The only way that we're gonna survive is by killing the beast. Well, Captain, that sounds simple enough. The laser gun I constructed just isn't strong enough to kill a creature that size... it would only scare him off for a while. Yeah, until it gets hungry enough not to feel any pain. I can sympathize with that. Alright, how about this? We'll start a fire in its cave and burn it alive. Oh, that's real smart, look at all this dry grass. All these trees These woods would go up in an instant and take us with it. Alright that's it. I'm sick of coming up with great ideas. and having you guys shoot em' down If your so smart, you think of something! Okay look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you guys like that. I don't know. I guess I got a lot on my mind. It's all right. It's hard on all of us. I got an idea. Okay, we're the only people on this planet. Right? Well, yeah as far as we know. Okay... So here's what we do. We reproduce, and populate this planet with our sons and that way soon they'll get strong enough to band together and defeat the beast. In fact... we should start reproducing right now. And uh, since Morda here is the only women among us - she's the... MORDA: Keep your pathetic wet dreams to yourself fat boy. It's time to play a little game. [LAUGHS CUNNINGLY] Tell me something, Captain. Yes? Do you like me? Uh, yeah. Morda, I like... I like you. I mean really like me. You know, really really like me. I want you, Captain. [EXCLAIMING] I really really want you. [GROWLING] [SCREAMS] What timing! [GROWLING] We heard the screams! [GROWLING] C'mon let's go before we're next. [BENJ EXCLAIMS] [DINOSAUR FOOTSTEPS] I can't believe I forgot the sticks! It'll be dark soon. And cold. We're gonna freeze to death. Not you. You have enough of layers of fat on you to keep us all warm. Maybe we should cut you up and wrap ourselves inside of your flab. Oh, please don't start yelling and screaming. Not now. Morda's right. We've got to try to stick together and stay calm. [FOOTSTEPS] Okay, I'm sorry, I... Sometimes I let this captain thing go to my head. The idea of power over people. I don't know I know it's whipped, but... it feel so good. [FOOTSTEPS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] That's nothing to be ashamed of, Kronik. It happens to anyone who's given control of a group of people. You just got to look out for it. Keep it under control. [SCREAMS] Come out or I'll fry you to ashes. Be careful. What is it? Caveman? What do we say to it? Ug? Ug? You want me to say "Ug"? Uh... Ug. Ug! Professor it works. Ug! Ug. Ug, ug, ug... [GIBBERISH] Ugga, ugga, ugga ugga! [LAUGHING] [LAUGHS] Ug! Ug, ug... [GIBBERISH] [LAUGHS] Ugga, ugga, ugga ugga! Hey, what are we sayin'? I don't know. Ask him his name. What- In caveman talk. Oh yeah right. Ugh [GIBBERISH] Ug. His name's Ug. Great. Now ask him about food. What about- [GIBBERISH] He understands, great! Smorgasbord! Let's go. [GIBBERISH] What's he sayin'? I think he's telling us to eat the leaves. Leaves? Yes. Yes he's saying to eat the leaves. [GIBBERISH] Well, let's eat. Hmm it tastes sweet. Like some sort of sugar. GETING: Yeah, except I hope we don't hallucinate this time. All I know is if my tongue starts tingling Geting's getting a mouth full of leaves. Not too bad. Benj is the big meat eater. I didn't think he'd go for this kind of stuff. Hey, I go for any kind of food. Besides, you put your mind to it, it tastes exactly like fried mugwump flanks... basted in a sugar syrup. Save some for our friendly chef. Hey, where'd he disappear to...? Anyone see him leave? More for us. [GROWLING] [GROWLING] Ug? Ug? Ug? [WHISTLING] Ug? Ug! Come on home, boy. [DINOSAUR GROWLS] [SHOCK MUSIC] [DINOSAUR GROWLS] [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] [SIGHS] [COMEDIC BOUNCE, BODY FALL] [EXCLAIMING IN HORROR] That was close. Yeah we better get out of here. Let's grab Benj and get outta here. Where is he? [GROWLING] What? No, Mommy... I wasn't watching... what? Where am I? C'mon guys let's get outta here. [SWISH] I can't go any further. I gotta rest. Well, we're not gonna wait. We'll see you back at camp. Let's go. But don't be too long, Benj. You know it's not safe out here. That's alright. I'll just be a minute. I gotta catch my breath. Okay, we'll see you later then. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GROWLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC, DISTANT GROWLING] Guys...? [STAMMERS] Is that you? Hey, c'mon you guys. This isn't funny. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC, DISTANT GROWLING] You know, you're not scaring me! [SIGHS] [GROWLING] Thought I recognized that sound. [EXCLAIMING IN HORROR] Where'd that caveman get off to, anyway? And why didn't he warn us about those creatures? They could have eaten us alive. Well, maybe they got him and ate him. I don't trust him. Let's not be too hasty. Maybe he doesn't trust us. Either way, I don't want him around. [SCREAMING] Benj! [SCREAMING] Benj? Benj! Benj? Benj. [WHISTLING] C'mon home, boy. Benj. Benj! [GROWLING] It got Benj. Now it's coming for us. [DRAMATIC MUSIC SWELL] Look over there! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] It's Benj. Anyone for leftovers? [BURPS] [COUNTRY SONG PLAYING] * Just outside these prison bars * A hanging tree is waiting [BENJI UNZIPS PANTS] [BENJ PEEING] * Tomorrow I'll meet Sunrise And death will say hello [BENJI ZIPS PANTS] * Darling press your lips to mine * And tell me that you love me * What is this? Doesn't make any sense. Shh. CAVEMAN: I don't understand... [SNIFFS] Why, that son of an intergalactic whore. So, he can talk. MORDA: Get him, Kronik! Apprehend him! [GROANING] Don't kill me. Please don't kill me. You've got a lot of explaining to do. Yeah, why didn't you speak with us before? Answer him. You know, I thought you guys were just playing a game. You're a liar! Be easy on him. Be easy on him? After the stuff that he pulled...? Be easy on him? Why didn't you speak with us before? I was scared. Scared? Scared of what? We wouldn't hurt you. Excuse me for a second. What's your real name, anyway? Ug... Bob. Bob Ug? No. Just Bob. Well Bob... do you get your jollies on by making alien visitors feel like fools on your planet? Look I told you I was scared. It's been so long since I've been around anybody other than those monsters. You mean there's been other people here? Are they still around? There were others. But they're dead now. It was so long ago. They all dropped from this shiny little creature that fell from the sky. A shuttle. Probably a lot like ours. They didn't last long. The monsters made a meal of 'em. One by one. Just like us. Well, I hate to interrupt this lovely little chat but it's gonna be dark soon. We better build a fire and cook this food before it gets dark. Don't worry, you're safe now. You got that thing working yet? I don't know what's wrong with it. Bob must have broke it when he was messing around with it. Sorry for breaking your machine. Here, take this instead. Flick the tip. Where'd you get this, Bob? In my cave. The cave? You mean the one where the dinosaur lives? Uh huh. It used to be mine but he came in and took over. That means there might be other people here. I don't think so. "Billy Bob's Intergalactical Gas 'Em Up" has been closed for quite some time. Oh, I see that you haven't got the fire started yet. How you like your Leg of Monster cooked, Bob? Oh, I don't eat that sort of stuff. Why not? What do you eat? Plants, leaves and berries. That sort of stuff. A vegetarian caveman. That explains why you're not wearing any animal skins. I don't think it's right to cause pain and suffering to other creatures. Why? They think it's fine to cause pain and suffering to you. Someday they'll realize that I'm they're friend and I only want peace in the valley for all forms of life. They're dinosaurs, for crying out loud! They have brains. They can think. Benj you don't look so hot. I don't feel so hot. Probably all that raw meat he ate. He's probably got worms crawling around inside of his intestines the size of ropes. Seeing how everything's big around here. [VOMITING] [SQUEAKING NOISE] [GROWLING] [SCREAMS] That was Benj! Geting, bring the laser! Come on. You're coming with us this time... [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [STAMPEDING] It won't work! I thought you fixed that. So did I. Run Benj! [STAMPEDING] [DINOSAUR GROWLS] That did it. Shoot it! [LASER GUN FIRING] [SCREAMING] You missed! I can't believe you missed. Gimme that thing. [GLASS SHATTERING] Oh, now look what you've done. [RUMBLING] [SCREAMING] Whoa. [BENJ EXCLAIMS] [STABBING NOISE] Oh, I can't believe this. Did you have any part of this? Don't be stupid. He was with us! There could be more of them, liar that he is. How can we be sure? All the meat's gone. Not a bone left. It was here. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] All I know is that somebody better keep watch tonight. I will. I don't think so. Kronik! I still don't trust him. I'll do it. You guys get some sleep. No that's okay. I wanted to work on my notebooks anyhow. Alright that's fine by me. Here, use mine. I won't be needing it. It's a portable sleep chamber. Oh, I get it. [SNORING] Too dark to write anymore. [SIGHS] [ZIPPER OPENS] [EXCLAIMING IN RELIEF] [GROWLING] Huh? [DINOSAUR GROWLS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREECHING] What was that? It's back. Run for it. Hey wait. Help. Get me outta here. [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] wait! Wait! Help. Help! Help. Wait wait wait. Help! Help. [GROANING] [SCREAMS] Giant maggots! Die! Die! Die! It's Bob the caveman not maggots. Oh, I killed him! I killed him. I killed him! Aah! Shocked me. Something's not right here. Somebody's playing games with us. I'm sick of it. You better stop playing games with us. I'm sick of it. I don't know who you are. Where you are. I'm sick of it. You hear me? I'm sick of it. [LAUGHS CUNNINGLY] Where are you? Where are you! Alright, I got this idea. What? We dig this hole. A really huge hole. And we lure the dinosaur out of its cave. - Yeah. - And we let it chase us until we get to the hole. Then we'll let it drop in. How? Push it? I don't know. I haven't thought about that part yet. And how are we going to dig a hole anyway? With our hands? Listen it's just an idea. You got a better idea? No. Then stop cutting down everything I come up with. I admit I have a lot of idiotic ideas. But at least they're ideas. At least I'm trying. What are you doing? Anything? Huh? How'd you get this job anyway? What do you mean? How did you get to be the captain of an intergalactic mission? You can't even think your way out of a wet sack of crap. How? I don't get it. I... slept with someone. What? I slept with someone. There, you happy? Now you know the ugly truth. I slept with somebody to get this job. And who was it? Queen Carlotta? I can't tell. Why? We're never gonna get off this planet. Who am I gonna tell, anyway? The dinosaurs? "Captain Kronik slept with the Queen!" I did not! Who was it, then? The Emperor's daughter? You slept with Blanchley, the Emperor's daughter? I'm not telling. Let it rest. Man's gotta have some pride. You call sleeping with Blanchley... the biggest space slut in the Universe pride? Ha! You probably caught a case of the crotch craters from her. Will you just drop it. I'm sorry. I guess I just wanted to hurt you since... you rejected me. Well, it's not you. Believe me. It's not you. And now for the grand finale. This is going to be... delicious. [LAUGHS] But I do think you're beautiful. Then why don't you love me? I do love you. You're just like a sister to me. Don't start that speech. I've heard it a million times. You know, it doesn't matter what planet you land on, all men are the same. Morda... wait! I hate you. I hate you. [GROWLING] [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] I'm not gonna run from you anymore you cheap Godzilla rip-off. [TOSSES SPEAR] Ha, how does that feel? Huh? [DINOSAUR GROWLS] Uh oh. [DINOSAUR GROWLS] Come on, let's go. Go, go! [CHASE MUSIC, DINOSAUR GROWLS] Down here! [CHASE MUSIC, DINOSAUR GROWLS] [LOUD SWISH] It worked. [GROWLS] [DINOSAUR ROARS IN PAIN] [DINOSAUR ROARS IN PAIN] [DINOSAUR ROARS IN PAIN] That was convenient. That's it. Everything we own in one bag. Well, let's go. Which way? Think it matters? That's true. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] Let's stop here. This looks like a good place to make camp. Yeah we got everything we need. We got water, berries and tree to relieve ourselves. I'm gonna go get some wood for a fire. Alright, that sounds good. I'll go ahead and clear us a spot on the ground. If you hear anything, you scream. Gotcha. [EXCLAIMS] Graft! Miss me? We thought you were dead. I may smell like it but I'm far from dead. Yeah, but how did you get off the shuttle? That's a funny story, man. I'm all set to die right. Then I start thinking hey, if I connect this wire to that wire would so and so happen? And it worked. I was able to transmit myself from the shuttle before the ship blew. But did you ever figure out what went wrong, Graft? How did somebody get on the ship and just rearrange everything? And why? Why does someone want us here anyway? You know, I think I got that part down, too. Someone did want us here. Someone on your ship. On the ship? Yeah. Someone on your crew, captain, got into computer when no one was looking and they switched the coordinates all around. When we thought we were staring into the Milky Way, we were actually millions of light-years away. Yeah, but why would somebody want us here anyway? That's what I can't figure out. An experiment. A what? An experiment. Someone built this place. It's not real. It's all artificial. Someone dragged life from other planets scattered them around and let them repopulate until a brave new world was built. The only thing that was missing was people. They needed people to see if they could survive in a situation like this. If they were strong enough, smart enough to beat the terrible beasts that ruled this world. I think it's more of a game than a scientific experiment. To tell you the truth. I think your absolutely right. And I think that you're the one that's controlling it. Ladies and gentlemen... we have a winner! Gurtorius Gonimus! I thought you were dead. That, my friend, was only wishful thinking. Why? Why would you do this? Because he's sick and perverted and deserves to die. That's only part of the reason. The truth is, Zyrox used me as a scapegoat. This was all the Emperor's idea, not mine. But the Emperor wanted to use this place as a vacation resort. [LAUGHS] At least that's what he told the ministry of public officials. Truth is, this is to be a gulag, a prison planet for the dregs of society. Whores, thieves, murderers... anyone who didn't abide by the rules set by society. Men, women, children... it didn't matter. You broke the law you landed on Gurgon. Gurgon? Yes Gurgon, named after myself, of course. Gur-torius Gon-imus? Gurgon! Like that? I built the place. I might as well name it after myself. But who would want a prison named after them? Who would want a disease named after them? Scientists do it all the time. Anything to live on in the annals of history. Yeah, but... why this planet? It had the perfect atmosphere to sustain our race. Besides the inhabitants were so nearly extinct [WHISPERS] I just had to finish the job. You killed them? No. Didn't touch 'em. I let my monsters do it for me. Then I got a little lonely. So I built myself a friend out of a freshly killed corpse of the last remaining native. Carved him out and filled him full of machinery. I'm a whiz at that, you know. The caveman. Bob, please... caveman sounds so... primitive. You say the Emperor used you as a scapegoat. But how? A friend of yours got his nose wet sniffing around where it ought not have been. He opened up the wrong computer at the wrong time and found the real reasons behind Gurgon. Graft. Alas, poor Graft... but only a shell of his former self. If he had kept his big mouth shut you two would be sitting comfortably on the Odyssey digesting a horrible little meal from planet Earth. But no... Graft had to tell two friends and they told two freeings and so on and so on and so on. Pretty soon a rumor got started. The Emperor was building a prison planet to hide all dissidents. Ban them from Zyrox so he could kill the queen and rule the world under his strict and horrible hand. Which really wasn't far from the truth, you know. You were blamed for it, though. You brainwashed the Emperor. Made him do bad bad things. They said it was all your doing. Yeah, you planted an electrode in his head to control his thoughts. You believe that? You believe anything a politician tells you? They made up those rumors so the Emperor's blossoming political career wouldn't wilt. By saying I did all those nasty things they made him to be the sympathetic hero. While I, the villain. Some melodrama, eh? They planned to silence me, too. I had to leave. No one knew of Graft's death. We sent a double in his place so his mission could go on as planned. Originally, this ship was suppose to explode before it left our solar system. But I changed all that. You killed Graft's double and took his place? Then you reprogrammed everything in the computer. which veered us off course and brought us here. You're good, Morda. Very good. I'm gonna enjoy spending the rest of my life with you. What do you mean by that? He means he's gonna kill you and make me his cheap little sex slave. You are good! And you're dreaming! There's no way I'd spend any time with a shriveled-up piece of shit like you. And there's no way that I'd let her. This is no time for cheap heroics, Captain Kronik... I believe you have no choice in the matter. Could you please step aside, my dear? I don't want to scorch your pretty little jumpsuit. Not that you'll be needing it much for what I have planned. [SCREAMS] Oh, stop the theatrics. You can't save him now. You try to run... and I'll burn you both. [GROWLING] It's me, your master! You wouldn't dare! [SCREAMING] [BREAKING BONES, CHEWING] Help me. Help me. I won't kill you. I promise. [DINOSAUR ROARS] [BREAKING BONES, CHEWING] [DINOSAUR ROARS] [PLEASANT MUSIC PLAYING] We have no choice now. What do you mean? We're the last people on the planet... the only survivors. Yeah? Well, don't you get it? It's up to us. What are you talking about? You and me. What Benj was saying earlier was right. We have to reproduce, raise a huge family and populate this planet. Morda, don't. I don't get it, Kronik. We have to do this whether you like it or not. The future of this planet depends upon it and we depend upon it. And now is not the time to dig up all those old repressed emotions. It's the new world Kronik. A new chapter of history and it's up to us. I love you. I'm gay. Excuse me...? I can't love you. I'm gay. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] MORDA: Kronik! I can't believe it. I can't believe they did that. We've been on Earth this whole time. They blew it up. They blew up the planet Earth! Those bastards! Bastards! Bastards! [SIGHS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] * Just outside these Prison bars * A hanging tree is waiting * Tomorrow I'll meet sunrise And death will say hello * Darling press your lips To mine * And tell me that you love me * And promise me again Before you go * Will you visit me on Sundays * Will you bring me Pretty flowers * Will your big blue eyes Be misty * Will you brush away a tear * A grave lies in silence * But if a sleeping man Could hear * Darling will I hear your footsteps up there? [GROWLING] [GROWLING]
