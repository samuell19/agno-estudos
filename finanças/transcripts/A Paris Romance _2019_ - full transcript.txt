Travis: Yep, and we'll sell the excess grapes that we can't use to California, like your dad always did. Isabella: I want you to try something. Travis: Great, first taste of your new wine? Isabella: You'll see. So I lowered the sugar content and smoothed out the tannins in this year's Pinot Noir. [laughs] Travis: Experimenting already? Isabella: Just taste it. [sniffing] [sipping sounds] Travis: Wow. This is amazing. Isabella: Well it's probably just beginner's luck. Travis: My niece, the winemaker. You know your dad would be so proud of you. Isabella: Well you're the one who insisted we put in the new drip irrigation system and it's made all the difference in the world to our grapes. Travis: Well that's true. You can't make good wine without good grapes, right? Isabella: Exactly. I mean we're growing the best Pinot Noir grapes in Oregon. We should increase production. Travis: Isabella, we're not selling the bottles to increase production. Isabella: Not yet. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Anton, hi, it's so good to see you, thank you so much for your time. Anton: Of course, Isabella, what can I do for you? Isabella: Well I need a wine distributor. Anton: Ricci Heritage Reserve I like the name. Isabella: Oh, thank you, I named it to honor my dad. Anton: He was a good friend. Isabella: Yeah. Oh. Chateau Saint-Fournier? Are you distributing for them now? Anton: Yes, I just snagged the North American rights. Isabella: That's so impressive. Anton: So, who else have you shared your new Pinot with? Isabella: You're the first. Anton: Hmm, good color. Smooth, big flavor. Notes of black currant and orange peel. Fresh and complex. How many cases have you produced? Isabella: A thousand. Anton: Unfortunately that's not really enough for me to take you on as a client. Isabella: We're a boutique family producer, but we could double our output by next year with your help as our distributor. Anton: I worked with your father on the side as a favor because we were friends. He wasn't interested in international distribution, he was happy to sell his wine in local restaurants and wine bars, but I don't think that's what you want. Isabella: No, you're right. We're bigger, we've modernized, we're more efficient, that's why we're producing more grapes. And I've gotten a lot of really good feedback on this Pinot Noir. See, I see an opportunity here, Anton. Anton: I appreciate that. And although I personally love Oregonian wines, they're a tough sell. Isabella: Well, Clover Falls Vineyard is just up the road from me, I saw at least five Oregon wines when I walked in. Anton: Gold medal, West Coast Wine Competition. Silver medal, National Chardonnay Festival. Isabella: You know my dad didn't believe in wine competitions. He thought they were rigged. Anton: If you want to grow your sales, you've got to be more aggressive with your marketing. Isabella: Okay. Anton: Maybe you should enter a few local wine competitions, build up your following. Isabella: How long do you think that will take? Anton: You could be looking at a few years. Isabella: Years? Anton: What's your hurry? Isabella: Well I want to take my family's winery next level and, Anton, I truly believe that the Ricci Heritage Reserve is the wine to do that. Chateau Saint-Fournier won Le Grand Prix des Vins du Monde in Paris. Maybe that's the wine competition I should enter. Anton: The Grand Prix is the Olympics of wine competitions. That's what you work up to, not start with. Look, take my advice, start here in Oregon. When you've won a couple of competitions, give me a call, my door is always open. Isabella: Okay. Well thank you so much, I really appreciate it, Anton. Anton: Of course. Good luck. Isabella: Anton said we shouldn't even bother entering the French competition, that we should just start local. Travis: Why not do both? This is your year. Bella, I feel it. Go big or go home, right? Isabella: That's great but the odds of us actually winning the competition, not so great. Travis: I know. Chateau Saint-Fournier has won the last five years in a row, but you know something? This could still be a great opportunity for you to, to network. There's bound to be other wine distributors there. Isabella: That's true. Travis: And your friend Lacey, she's still in Paris, isn't she? You haven't visited her yet. Isabella: Yeah but this is my first wine, I don't want to get ahead of myself. Travis: No, Bella, you know my grandfather back in Italy, you know what he used to say to me? "Fortune favors the bold." Isabella: I know but we're not in Italy, Uncle Travis. I think I should just take Anton's advice. You know, start local, see what happens. [laughs] ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Travis: Isabella, Isabella. Isabella: Yeah. Travis: Read this.

You know they're announcing the, the finalists at breakfast tomorrow and I was wondering if maybe you wanted to join me. Jacques: I would love to, except I have to be there any way.

Jacques: Bon chance a toi. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ [sighs] ♪♪♪ Margot: You disappeared yesterday. Maurice: He's been busy showing his friend Isabella around Paris. Margot: Playing the tour guide to the American? Jacques: No, I just wanted to be polite. And you know her wine is superb. Margot: That's high praise coming from you. Are you concerned? Jacques: No, I think it might help us improve. Maurice: We don't need to improve. Chateau Saint-Fournier has been made exactly the same way for the last 300 years. Jacques: You know, Maurice, change is a good thing. Margot: Please don't argue in public. Where is your badge, did you forget it? Jacques: I couldn't find it this morning. [cell phone ringing] Isabella: Hey. Lacey: Hey, did you make it to the next round? Isabella: They're making the announcements in a few minutes, so I actually got to go. Lacey: Oh wait, can you bring Jacques to Luc's restaurant opening tonight? He's dying to meet him. Isabella: Yeah, sure, I can ask him. I've got to run. [applause] Bonjour. Jacques: Good morning. Maurice: Bonjour. Margot: Bonjour, Isabella. Isabella: Bonjour. Philippe: Good morning, everyone. The judges have decided which wines will enter the final round. And from these finalists, they will decide the medal winners in each category. We'll start with Pinot Noir. So first off Chateau Saint-Fournier Pinot Noir Burgundy, France, Maurice Fournier. [applause] And the next Golden Sky Winery Napa Valley, California, Seth and Diana Ridgeworth. [applause] And for the next wine, it's the first time that this region has ever made it to the final. Empire Gorge Winery Finger Lakes, New York, Sumont Robert. [applause] And of course Chateau Saint-Fournier Reserve Pinot Noir Burgundy, France, Jacques Fournier. Maurice: Brother. Isabella: Congratulations. Jacques: Thank you. Philippe: Congratulations to everyone. Oh, sorry, I didn't see the last one. Ricci Heritage Reserve Ricci Ridge Winery-- [laughs] Jacques: Congratulations. [applause] Isabella: Congrats. Maurice: You too. Margot: Congratulations. Isabella: Merci. [laughs] Please contact us when you're in Germany. Yes, yes, please. It was a pleasure. Isabella: Thank you so much, I'll be in touch. Jane: Ms. Ricci. Hi, I'm Jane Townsend and I blog about West Coast wines. I'm wondering if I could possibly schedule an interview with you. Isabella: Oh yes, I would love that, Jane. Jane: Great, I'll give you a call. Jacques: Hello. Isabella: Hi. Jane: Jacques Fournier. It's an honor to meet you. Jacques: Pleasure is all mine. I see you've already met Isabella. Jane: Yes, just now. Have you tried the Ricci Pinot? Jacques: Ah yes, I have. Jane: And can I quote you? Jacques: Of course. The Ricci Heritage Reserve Pinot is rich, smooth, and unexpected. It's the wine to beat this year. Jane: Thank you. I am going to post that right now. Isabella: Thanks. Wow, that was a really, really nice thing for you to say. Jacques: I was just telling the truth. Isabella: Well I appreciate it. Christina: Jacques, salud. Jacques: Christina, hello. You remember Isabella? Christina: Of course. Isabella: Hi. Christina: So I think I made a mistake giving Jacques' wine to my chef instead of yours. Jacques: What? I am offended at this. Christina: You'll survive. Isabella: Well, you know, we both made it as finalists. Christina: I'm going to give your wine to my chef tonight, I promise. Isabella: Oh, thank you, that's very nice. Jacques: Excuse me, I see someone I must speak with. A plus tard. Christina: I am so glad you are spending time with Jacques. It's nice to see him smile again. Isabella: So you two aren't dating? Christina: No. We are old friends. He's like a brother to me. Isabella: Oh. Okay. Christina: Good luck. Isabella: Thank you. Philippe: Mademoiselle Ricci, there is a reception later for the finalists, can you join us? Isabella: Yes, I would love to. Philippe: Everyone is looking forward to trying your wine. Isabella: Great. Philippe: I'll see you. Isabella: Okay. Wow. Philippe: Bonjour. Jacques: Mademoiselle Ricci. So have you found a distributor yet? Isabella: Well I have a few people who are interested, but no one will commit until after the awards are given out. Jacques: So this means you have some time. Isabella: Time for what? Jacques: To visit a boutique perfumery. Isabella: You know I, I don't think that's on the tourist trail. Jacques: No, no, no, Chant Bleu is a very special perfumery. It's owned by an old friend of the family, my mother has been going there for years. Isabella: You know I was actually hoping to go to a panel on label design. Jacques: Why? No, your label for Ricci Heritage Reserve is beautiful already. It's classy, elegant. They're not going to teach you anything that you don't already know. Isabella: Yeah, what am I going to learn at a perfumery? Jacques: Well you see, making perfume is not an exact science, it's half chemistry, half art. Isabella: Like winemaking. Jacques: Exactly. So, we go? Isabella: Pourquoi pas? [laughs] Jacques: Very good. Isabella: Did I say that right? Jacques: You did, exactly. Pourquoi pas? Isabella: Pourquoi pas? Jacques: It's not so Spanish as this. Perfumers are alchemists, meet artists, meet chemists. They use all of their knowledge and talents to compose their masterpieces. Isabella: Masterpieces? Jacques: You will see. [laughs] Voila. The perfumes of Chant Bleu are available only in Paris, but they're sought after by royalty all over the world. Claude: Jacques. Jacques: Claude. Claude: So good to see you. Jacques: And you. Claude: How is your wonderful mother? Jacques: Ah, tres bien, merci. Claude: Good. Jacques: May I present to you my friend from America Isabella Ricci. Claude: Enchante, mademoiselle. Isabella: So nice to meet you. Your shop is beautiful. Claude: Merci. And your timing is impeccable. I've just finished my latest Eau de Cologne. Isabella: Oh, what's it called? Claude: You know, I haven't decided yet. Here, try it. Isabella: Hmm, let's see. I detect vanilla. Claude: Mm-hmm. Isabella: Jasmine. And a hint of patchouli. Claude: Bravo, perfect, yes. It's bright and floral but with an earthy finish. N'est ce-pa? Jacques: May I? It's beautiful. Claude: You know, perhaps you would like to help me name it. Isabella: Sure, how about Summer Wind? Jacques: I know, Femme inoubliable. Claude: I love it, I love it. Femme inoubliable, voila! For you, mademoiselle. Isabella: Oh, merci. Okay so I know the word femme means woman. Jacques: Mm-hmm. Isabella: Inoubliable, what does this word mean? Jacques: Unforgettable. Isabella: This is really wonderful, thank you for taking me. Jacques: It was my pleasure. So, do you think you will go right back to Oregon after the competition or? Isabella: Unfortunately yes. You know how it is running a winery, there's always so many things to do. Jacques: Mm-hmm. Isabella: Kind of excited though because I have all these ideas I want to try out for new wines and-- Jacques: You know I'm, I'm kind of jealous of you. Isabella: Of me? Jacques: Yes. Isabella: What? Jacques: You get to modernize, and innovate, and experiment with your winery. But me, my family doesn't want to change anything. Isabella: Okay, come on, your winery is a classic. It's amazing. I mean you've won gold medal five years in a row. Jacques: I suppose. Isabella: Trust me, it's not always easy being the winery nobody has ever heard of. Jacques: Well you won't be for long. Isabella: Hey, my best friend's boyfriend is opening his new restaurant tonight Chez Reboul. I was wondering if maybe you wanted to join me? Jacques: Chez Reboul, it's famous already. I would love to. Isabella: Great, I think they want us there at like 8:00. Jacques: Perfect. Isabella: Perfect. Lacey: I don't see what the problem is, he's sweet, and charming, and gorgeous. Isabella: Yeah but we're so different. Lacey: So? Luc and I are completely different, it just makes things more interesting. Isabella: We also live 8,000 miles apart. Lacey: No, definitely not, you've got to look your best for Jacques. What's wrong? Isabella: I don't know, Lacey, it's just, you know when Stewart broke up with me, it took every piece of my strength to pull myself together and-- Lacey: Now you're afraid of getting involved again? Isabella: Yeah, yeah, I guess, yeah I guess I am. Lacey: Okay, I get it, I get it. This thing with Jacques is not practical, and it doesn't make sense, but you have just met an amazing guy in Paris. Most romantic city in the world. That's just proof that anything is possible in Paris. Isabella: Okay that's beautiful but you can't, just, you can't keep giving me stuff. Lacey: Yes I can, otherwise what is the point of me being a fashion designer? And... To pair. Isabella: Oh those are stunning. You know you're like a real life French Fairy Godmother. Lacey: Except I'm American. And definitely not old enough to be your Godmother. Isabella: Definitely not. [laughs] Thank you so much, Lacey. Lacey: Yeah of course, what are friends for? Isabella: You know as, as, as long as you're being so generous, you don't happen to have a clutch that might go with this? Lacey: Follow me. [laughs] [door knocks] Isabella: Hi. Jacques: Wow. You look fantastic. Isabella: Oh. Thank you. Jacques: Listen, Isabella, I, I'm sorry but my mother has just announced that she's retiring and the marketing team wants to do a whole campaign about this. Isabella: That sounds important. Jacques: They want to have a big meeting tonight though, which means I won't be able to make it to your friend's restaurant opening. I'm so sorry. Isabella: No, that's, I, I, I get it. You know, you're here to work and I'm here to work, so it's, it's fine. Jacques: Oh, well I'm, I really am disappointed. Isabella: Nope it's, it's, it's okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Jacques: Okay.

Lacey: Oh well Luc will be even more disappointed than you are. Isabella: Probably better this way, you know? Keep things professional between me and Jacques. Lacey: If you say so, but I don't think there's anything wrong with dating a cute guy in Paris. It's like Gougere, no guilt. Isabella: Gougere, what is that? Lacey: French for gooey cheese puff.

Isabella: This is the first I'm actually hearing about it. You can't listen to anything that Lacey says. Lacey: I like to put my wishes out into the world, that way I can manifest them. Jacques: Ah. Does this work for you? Lacey: Sure, that's how I met Luc, right? Luc: Pardon? I met you through my cousin. Lacey: Okay, well that's not the point. The point is wouldn't it be great if Isabella were to stay in Paris? Jacques: I think this would be great. Luc: Jacques, I have to tell you, I'm a huge fan of your new Pinot Noir. Jacques: Ah, you've tried it? Luc: Unfortunately I only have two cases, but they are saved for my favorite customers.

I'm having it shipped up from Paso Robles next week. Jacques: That's so great. Isabella: Yeah. Jacques: I'm very impressed. Isabella: Impressed by what? Jacques: By you. By the way you get things done. So fierce, so determined, like, like a little bulldog. Isabella: Oh yeah, you know, I know you think that sounds like a compliment. Jacques: It is a compliment. Isabella: Comparing a woman to a bulldog, it's not that flattering. Jacques: I love dogs. Isabella: Still doesn't translate. You're going to have to trust me on this one. Jacques: Okay. So, what's on the agenda today? Isabella: The agenda? I thought you didn't like agendas. Jacques: I don't, I was just trying to sound American. Isabella: Ooh, yeah, I'm going to pretend like you didn't say that. [laughs] I actually signed up for the workshop, the wine critique one with Julie Montard. Jacques: Oh no, you can't go to that. Isabella: Why? Jacques: I know Julie Montard, I've heard her speak, she's so negative. Isabella: Negative? Jacques: Yes, she's sad, bitter, destructive. She's too dangerous for a fragile young winemaker like you. Isabella: Okay, you know what? I'm not that fragile, Jacques, I can handle a little criticism. Jacques: She only likes French wine. Isabella: Oh. Jacques: I could teach you everything she knows in 10 minutes. Isabella: No, no, I just, I can't skip the workshop, Jacques.

Jacques: I'm not making it up, you know? This is a fact. So what, you don't believe in this kind of love? Isabella: Sure, I guess, for some people. My parents had that kind of love. Jacques: But not you? Isabella: Not so lucky. Jacques: Never? Isabella: Fine, okay. When I worked down in California there was a guy Stewart and he was a winemaker too. And we got really serious. We even talked about getting married. And then when my mom got sick, I went up to Oregon to help my dad with the winery and we just kind of drifted apart. Jacques: Love is like a vine, if you don't tend to it, it will wither up and die. [laughs] What? Isabella: Just there you go again. But you're right, because after a few months he called me and he broke up with me. Jacques: And now, have you given up on love? Isabella: Well it's just, you know, things are really hectic at the winery and, you know, my life is really complicated. Jacques: You know life is always complicated. It's beautiful, and it's ugly, and it's messy, all at the same time, but love, that's what makes life worth living. Isabella: You really believe that, don't you?

Isabella: Anton, hi, what a nice surprise. Please, have a seat. Anton: I was visiting one of my other clients nearby and I thought I would drop in. Congratulations, silver medal. Amazing. Isabella: Thank you. Anton: It must have been tough leaving Paris. Isabella: You have no idea. Anton: I see you must have been productive. Jonathan Ronen gave you quite a nice write up on your Heritage Reserve. Isabella: Wait, what? Jonathan Ronen wrote about my wine? Anton: He loved your wine. And having Jacques Fournier say it was the best Pinot he's tasted in five years, well I've had people calling me all week asking how to get it. Isabella: Jacques Fournier said my Pinot was the best he'd had in over five years? Anton: He was very generous. Travis: Well speaking of generous, we've been talking with a few U.S. distributors. Isabella: Yes, we have. Anton: Who? They can't poach you, this is my territory. Isabella: No, well I don't want any names, Anton, and you were friends with dad. And you did give me the idea of entering Le Grand Prix des Vins du Monde. Anton: That's right. Travis: Even though you said we didn't have a chance of getting in. Anton: Right, yes, I just didn't want you to get your hopes too high. Isabella: Well then if you can match what the other distributors are offering. Anton: Done. Isabella: And maybe increase it. Anton: I'll beat any offer you get by five percent. Travis: Sounds good, right? Isabella: Hold on. Just curious, Anton, how much are you willing to spend on advertising? Anton: That's an excellent question. I've got some great ideas on how to market the Ricci Ridge brand. Isabella: How much? [laughs] Anton: I'll send over the numbers in the morning. Isabella: Sounds good. Thank you. Anton: But you'll have to tell me how you landed that Jonathan Ronen article. He only talks to the major players. Isabella: Well, we are major players, Anton. Travis: That's right, major players. Anton: I'm starting to realize that. [laughs] Travis: Yes! Isabella: Shh. ♪♪♪ Margot: Jacques. Maurice: Ah, there you are. Are you ready for Maman's retirement party? Jacques: Yes. I'm not really in a festive mood, but of course. Margot: You miss her. Jacques: I haven't spoken to Isabella since she left Paris. She won't return my calls. I've stopped trying. Margot: You know I've always said not to get involved with someone who lives halfway across the world. But sometimes when you meet someone as special as Isabella, you can't let anything stand in your way. Maurice: She's right. Margot: I won this at the charity auction and I think you should try it. Jacques: I know this wine. Why do you think I should try it? Margot: Because they took a risk. Maurice: Some people are meant to carry on tradition. Margot: And some people are meant to take a new path. Oui. Jacques: Merci. Travis: Isabella. Isabella: Hi. Got the paperwork in from Anton, you ready to sign? Travis: Oh definitely, but could you help me for a second in the barrel room? One of the humidity controllers is broken. Isabella: Sure. Travis: Thanks. Isabella: You know ever since I won the wine competition it's like you think I can do anything and I have no idea how you expect me to help. I'm not a mechanic. Travis: Come on, it will take a second, I promise. Isabella: I mean I'll do what I can, but it's, I'm not sure... Jacques. ♪♪♪ Jacques: You haven't returned my calls in weeks. Isabella: So you just flew halfway around the world? Jacques: The magazine mixed up me and Maurice, you know I would never say anything like that. Isabella: I know. I actually ended up reading an article where you said my Pinot Noir was the best you'd had in over five years. Jacques: But still you didn't call me back? Isabella: Because you live in France. And I live here in Oregon, and I have no idea how we could possibly make this work. Jacques: I came here to give you a gift. Isabella: I know this wine. Jacques: This wine is all about taking risks. You see decades ago no one took California wines seriously. But then Baron Philippe de Rothchild collaborated with a new California winemaker and together they created a masterpiece. Isabella: And it ended up being one of the most successful wineries in the whole world. Jacques: Because it's the best of both worlds. The old and the new. Isabella: So, what are you saying, that you think we should make a new wine, you and me? Jacques: That's exactly what I'm saying. Isabella: Jacques, how can you leave your winery for that long? Jacques: I can be away as long as I like. I gave control to Maurice of Chateau Saint-Fournier. Isabella: You just gave it away? Jacques: Well sold it, he bought my share. Isabella: So, just to clarify, why would you sell your half of the winery? Jacques: Think about what we could do together, Isabella. A new partnership, Burgundy and Oregon, working together. Isabella: To create a new Pino. Jacques: Create a new life together. What do you think? Isabella: I think your brother better watch out because we're going to win gold next year. Jacques: Maybe we should toast to this new partnership? Isabella: I have a better idea. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪
