Holy shit. What the hell happened? He was beaten up very badly. Thank God he somehow managed to keep his head protected, or he would have been dead. What is it doctor? Well, his physical recovery has been very good. But his mind... refuses to wake up. What is troubling you? I can't remember my name. What's my name? You are Veer Singh. Then he was completely unpredictable and aggressive. We had no option but to sedate him. Then one morning his memory about his identity came back. I remember my name. Can I see him? 'The mind commits the crime,' 'The body takes the blame' 'What should one do,' 'when the accused,' 'is both, guilty and innocent?' 'So, follow this evidence closely. 'Because you will need to make your judgement.' 'A case like this happens but once in many lifetimes.' 'And mind you, this is inspired by true events.' This is how you should grip it. A simple grip. The ball needs to pitch on the seam. This is where you go wrong. Bounce it. Toss it slow. Rohit, your dad's here. Got it? Here. Bounce it, vary your pace. Try variations. Okay. See you tomorrow. Bye. Really nice? Fine. My friend. How's life? How are you doing? Good. Our card game gang is missing you. They are missing the only honest scapegoat who doesn't cheat. I don't even have time to breathe. I have just been put in charge of the Child Killer task force. Congratulations. Promotion after promotion. Not a promotion. For five years everybody has failed and now it is my turn to fail. You'll do well. I'll get going. I'll show up soon, to lose, again. Bastard. We wouldn't have had to go that far to set the snakes free. If not for that black SUV parked over there. True. Who brings a car so deep into the jungle? I have to say, saving snakes is an adventurous job. Stop dancing or I'll leave you behind with the snakes. What's that smoke? That idiot from the Black SUV must have done it. Let's put it out. Come on, I'll race you there. No! Come on run, fatso. Oh shit. Fuck. Throw sand on the fire, fast. There. Shit. Take it off. 38! What were you guys doing here? We are MBA students and animal activists. We had come here to set some rescued snakes free. We saw a Black SUV parked here. So we went further into the jungle to release the snakes. This is what we saw on our way back. Do you remember the registration number? No, sir. I think... it ended with 861 or 168. Ramcharan. Put up road blocks. Sir. Hey. Stop him. Stop! Stop! Hello Don't. Get the packages out. Hello. I can never thank you enough. You are like god for these kids. Shh, you'll upset HIM. Let's go. What's wrong? Got hit by a cricket ball. Okay. The orphanage committee has proposed to make you the chief guest this year. So? This is the farmhouse, sir. I've seen that he always parks that car over there. You stay with him. Others will go and search the farmhouse. Ramcharan, you come with me. Oh, my God. Veer Singh. You are under arrest for the murder of Shyam and Shyamala Yadav. What are you saying friend? What's wrong with you? You're joking, right? Arrest him. - What happened, sir? - Stay back, kids. - Relax. - No, no, no! No, sir. - Calm down, everyone. - Sir. Let the police do their job. I will be fine. Kids, go back to practicing. Let's go. Come on. Calm down, kids. I'll be back Where's yours? What the fuck, Veer! What the fuck have you done! You tell me I tell you? Stop pretending to be a saint. You know me better than anyone else. I wake up at 4:00am. I spend my days at the ground and evenings with you guys. My uncle isn't keep well for the past two weeks. So, I used to go meet him as well. You can ask his nurse. If you think that I did something on the way up or on the way back... You'll have to do better than this. Fine, I will do better. I will trust you. Fuck. Shut that, kids. Thank you. It's such a nice bicycle. My dad won't buy me one. He's getting a new one. I wish I get one for my birthday as well. What's wrong? The cake is here, so is the gift. So, Can I see that beautiful smile of yours? Pretty please? Hey! What's wrong? The clown backed out. No big deal. The kids will play and amuse themselves. They were so excited to see the bicycle. They will take turns to ride... Give it to me. Pass me the ball. No. Amit. I found one in your size. It took me so long to get the right one. - It's your size. - No way. - Listen. - I always do as you say. - But not this. -You will look good. I'll be a laughing stock. - It's looking so good. - Come on. Excuse me. It's sir. Yes, sir. Amit. The child Killer has been arrested. Veer Singh. Sir, are we sure it's him? Hmm. It's the same Veer Singh from Udaan We will be lynched if we get this wrong. I know. Yes there will be tremendous pressure. That's why we have chosen you to represent us. State Government will be keeping a close watch on the trial. Thank you for your trust in me, sir. Meet me tomorrow morning at nine. Pass it to me. Hey look at the ball. You missed. Amit? It's nothing. You okay? Absolutely. The clown is ready for the party. Whoa, bad shot. Oops. Aren't you going to say something? Bye? You selfish son of a bitch! Son of a bastard, actually. My mother was very nice. You only love yourself. You should do the same. We only breathe for one. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jesus. You'll need this. Hello, Anurag. To what do I owe this honour? The government is collapsing, Mr. Jaisingh. Turn on the news. The Lucknow police has arrested a decorated youth guru Veer Singh on the charge of murdering two migrant children. Now we wait to for the state government's next move. What is that to do with me? Government has managed to score a law... ...and order win by solving the Child Killer case. You need to defend Veer Singh and get him off. and the nomination to the upper house of parliament (Rajya Sabha) is yours. You're joking, right? The opposition doesn't joke this close to the elections. Party command has high expectations from you. Then consider it done. It was one of your bastard friends, dad. A seat in the upper house of parliament. And I did it faster than you. Our honourable Chief Minister...... has condemned this horrendous crime, and demanded a fast track court. Veer Singh has been denied bail and has been brought to Lucknow Central Jail. Go on. Take some pickle. It's over. Can I have some? Veggies are over too. You can have the pickles. Go on, take a pickle. How many of you already know Veer Singh? Oh. And how many of you have children, nieces or nephews who go to Udaan? Oh. We have to forget Veer Singh's reputation. and only look at the crime and the evidence. Only the crime and evidence. Oh, I'm sorry. Wrong room. No, it's the right room. Come in and have a seat. I was just reading your death warrant. According to the police, this is your statement. Here it says, "the suspect has no alibi," "when he travelled from his house to his sick uncle's house and back." "There is no record of how long he took or where he stopped." Did you say that? Yes. To the officer in charge, sir. He's a friend of mine. You have no friends here. I'm your only friend. In fact, I am your best friend now. By the way, I am Sid Jaisingh. I know, your reputation precedes you. But I am really sorry, I cannot afford you. At the moment, you can't afford not to have me. Relax. Don't worry about that. I want to fight this case pro bono for you. Why? We'll discuss that after we win. By the way I gave your previous lawyer a nice cheque. He was very happy. Now if you don't mind, please sign these documents. And then, we are good to go. Thank you very much. You need to pay prison tax to use equipment here. Dada Shah controls all the comforts here. So, how do you plan to pay? In cash or in kind? Otherwise you will have to clean all this with a toothbrush. Think about it. Mr. Shukla, find me a mechanic. What, no tip? Okay? All rise for the honourable judge. Criminal Case No. 332. State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Veer Singh. Appearing for the prosecution. Mr. Amit Kumar. Appearing for the defence. Mr. Siddarth Jaisingh. I expect the prosecution and the defence to maintain the highest standards of decorum during the proceedings. Opening statements please. Sir. Over the past five years, 38 migrant children have been murdered in our state. - This... - Objection your honour. This case has nothing to do with those 36 missing children. This court has the experience and the intellect not to be influenced by sneaky tricks pulled either by the prosecution or the defence. Overruled. Sir. Sir. The dead bodies we've found so far were burnt beyond recognition. Except for Shyam and Shyamala. Sir, Shyam and Shyamala... Sir, we have Leelaji and Rameshji, their parents, present in the court. During the trial we may say things that will upset them. I would like to apologise to them on behalf of the prosecution. Sir, we found half burnt dead bodies of Shyam and Shyamala. Therefore the police were able to crack the case and arrest the accused. Yes, I know, Veer Singh is a respected member of our society. But we will prove that the accused is guilty on the basis of the hard evidence. Thank you, sir. Prosecution got one thing right in its opening statement. Veer Singh is a respected member of the society. 38 children murdered in the span of five years and not a single arrest. I understand, our law agencies must be under severe pressure. Especially with elections coming up. If I was them, even I might have done what they are trying to do. Arrest a well-known personality. Sensationalize it. And use that to suppress your failure. Veer Singh? Come on! He's a national treasure your honour. He served this country as an officer in the security forces and has now dedicated his life and life savings to developing children through sport and skills. The prosecution used the most disgusting accusation to put him on trial. I think, Murdering the honour of An innocent man is as serious a crime... ...as murdering or killing a person. That's all your honour. Your honour. Prosecution would like to call the investigating officer. The investigating officer, take the stand. I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Please have a seat. Thank you so much. I'm comfortable. Please state your name and your post for the record. Sunil Sachdev. Deputy commissioner of police. I am leading the murder investigation, sir. Your honour, these are the crime scene pictures. If the accused had not been caught, would you have put this down as another of those child killings? Objection your honour. What do those other kids have to do with this case? That's what we are here to find out. Overruled. Proceed. Yes, sir. Why would you have thought that? The same modus operandi. Children of migrant workers abducted, killed and bodies set on fire. Could you tell the court how your investigation led you to the accused? Eyewitness' testimony lead us to a Black SUV. We caught that at a road block. And it is the same Black SUV which was used for the crime? Yes. We found blood fluids and blood samples in it. Its number plate was false and documents were forged. We traced the engine and chassis number and found the car was owned by a man called Harpal Fera from Kannauj. And that he had rented this car out five years ago to a man named Akal Singh. Sir, he was a renowned landlord of Hardoi. I had enquired about him before signing the contract. Okay. Then you arrested Akal Singh? No. The 'Akal Singh' Fera was talking about, didn't exist. Meaning? The IDs submitted for the contract were fake. No, hold on a second. But Harpal Fera surely met Akal Singh, right? I had met Akal Singh just once, sir. Young, fat, heavily-bearded guy. He signed all the documents. Here it is. Look. Here, take a look. After that everything was done over the phone. Deal renewal. Servicing. Pick up, drop. Cash would be placed in the car beforehand. So where would Mr. Fera pick up and drop off the vehicle? At a shutdown tractor showroom near the highway. Sir, he said that it would be a convenient place for me. But Fera was worried about his vehicle, so he followed the SUV to a farmhouse. That's how we found out that its outhouse was used to stage the crimes. Oh, my God! We found a seven-year-old boy chained to the wall in the basement. When asked, he said a Cotton Candy Uncle brought him there. Were Shyam and Shyamala too... Yes. We have received DNA confirmation. Did you find anything else there? We found a used fat suit. A spirit gum that is used to stick fake beards. But we didn't find any fake moustaches or beards there. There were a lot of packets of cotton candy in the room. We found a box of nitrile gloves in the cupboard. Perhaps that's the reason we didn't find any fingerprints there. In your investigation you have stated that you then traced the owner of the house. Yes. We found Mr. Akal Singh. A thin and frail 80 year old man. Looked after by a full time nurse. He had willed and handed over the farmhouse to his nephew. Who is this nephew of his? Veer Singh. Silence, please. No further questions, your honour. Thank you. Your witness, sir. DCP sir, would you clear a doubt for me? You said that you didn't find my client's fingerprint on anything in the basement. Right. Not even on the nitrile glove box? Right. Are you saying that my client wore gloves to buy the box of nitrile gloves? Would such a careful man use his property to commit horrific crimes? It's just a thought. Never mind. More importantly, Harpal Fera never said that my client was the man who hired the car. Nor is my client a fat man with a beard. Because around the time the fat man was running away from the road block, my client was driving with sweets to the Bal Bhavan orphanage. In fact, Its mentioned in your statement. After two hours. The accused is an excellent runner. The farmhouse is only 5 kilometres from the road block. Runner, eh? Did you time it with an equally good runner? Running on uneven ground disguised as a fat man? Take a shower? Change? Get into another car and drive back? I didn't feel the need to. I have run with the accused I know he can do it. You didn't feel the need to?! I can see you have conducted your investigations with great attention to detail. Hmm. Do you know which car does my client drive? A small car, it's red in colour. Well done. So you believe that my client was able to drive a red car and a black SUV looking like two different people on the same road in opposite directions And that too, without causing an accident. Objection your honour. This is not a stand-up comedy routine. Comedy? The real comedy is that they have arrested my client with no proof. What we've heard so far only proves that my client's property was being used by a ruthless killer who the police have not succeeded in finding. Veer Singh is a true patriot. One of the great citizens of this country. He dedicated his life for this country. First as an officer and now as a teacher. I salute you from the bottom of my heart. Does this ring a bell? This is the speech I had made for Veer. Did you mean what you said? I believe that. Used to believe that. And you no longer believe it. Now you believe that Veer Singh was driving that Black SUV and tomorrow you might no longer believe that. Objection, your honour. It's okay. I have no more questions, your honour. "There's no need to ask anymore." Get the bags from there and close this door. Here comes the Judge! Why are you so serious, Judge? Why, Shobha? Why start drinking again after staying sober for nine months? Why, Shobha? Who said I was sober for nine months? You just didn't find the evidence. You know, we'd get along much better, if I could only pour you out from the bottle. Get going, man. Hurry up, dude. Would you like some chicken? You've lasted longer than expected. Dada Shah's offer is still open. He likes you. He wants you as his personal. Wait, wait, wait. Wear your socks first. Only one? Where's the other one? Just one sock... Step aside. You always delay him. I didn't know they were not inside the shoes. Dad... Hmm? On TV, I've seen that lawyers have fancy cars. Why do we own such a rickety one? Son, there are some lawyers who look after themselves, Then there are some who are honest public prosecutors like your dad. - Oh my my. - Like Superman? Yes. Like Superman. No like Shaktiman [Indian fictitious superhero]. Fine, like Shaktiman. Look, boom and I've become Shaktiman. Dad, you look like a crow it that black garbs. Because I am the Crow-Man, the Law-Man. Shall we? Alok Awasthi. I am a forensic surgeon. Did you perform the autopsies of Shyam and Shyamala? Yes. The children were seven years old? Right. Can you describe the state in which both the dead bodies were brought in? Their bodies were burnt. But we could identify them. Were you able to determine the cause of death? Both of them had been strangulated. Anything other findings during your forensic investigation? Both of them were sexually assaulted. Before and after death. After death too? And there is something else that was unusual. The boy's jaw was locked as if he had bitten into something really hard. The muscles were completely jammed. On opening his mouth we saw that he had bitten his own tongue. We also found a skin type of substance there which we have sent for DNA testing. It is possible that the kid might have bitten his murder's hand as well. Objection, that's speculation. He's not making a definite assertion. Overruled. Sir. The accused had this mark on his wrist when he was arrested. We'll discuss this in detail when we'll call a bite expert in. Mr. Singh? It must have hurt really bad. No further questions, your honour. No questions, your honour. But yes, an observation. Prosecution is speculating that the injury on Veer's wrist is a bite mark. While according to my client, that mark was caused by a cricket ball striking him. When the prosecution calls the bite mark expert... I'll prove that a cricket ball also has teeth. It's called the seam. Thank you. Please state your name and your profession for the record. I'm Maya Kanwal. My field is forensics. I have 16 years of experience and I've been trained in the US. Ms. Maya, according to your statement you found accused's DNA sample on the kids. Yes. On the boy's back and the girl's navel. And you stated the vehicle was loaded with DNA of the two kids? That's correct. Blood, fluids, skin cells, all of it. Did you find the accused's DNA in the vehicle? Surprisingly no. Not even on the fat suit? No. Sir. As you can see this is the work of a well-trained, highly intelligent man. Ms. Maya, what did you find at the defendant's farmhouse? We found DNA of the murdered children and other blood spots that we don't have matches for. In fact, many blood spots. Many blood spots? - Shall we say 36 more? - Objection. Sustained. Did you find DNA of the defendant? Yes. Plenty. In fact, around where the children were tortured. Where the children were tortured? And what did you find at Veer Singh's home? Condoms. With a coating that matches the residue found inside the children's anus and vagina, during the autopsy. No further question, your honour. Your witness, sir. Let me confess, I too use the same brand of condoms. Does that make me a suspect too? Or has forensic science reached a level where they know who exactly wore the condom just by looking at the packet? Objection, your honour. The defence is mocking the expert. Mr. Jaisingh, please save your sarcasm for when you actually get into politics. Ma'am, please answer the question. No. We can only know who wore the condom if there is DNA evidence linking the user to it. So you don't have DNA evidence linking my client with the residue inside the children? Yes or no? Can you answer my question, ma'am? Anyways. Are you gonna... Please. Yeah. Thank you. Sorry. Excuse me. Your honour? Thanks. Isn't it true madam that DNA has a way of transferring easily and lingering wherever we go? Yes. So my DNA is now on this glass? Yes. Hmm. If DNA transfers so easily it explains how the defendant's DNA was transferred onto the kids When they were lying on his property. But it also raises the question why have you not found my client's DNA in the vehicle used to transport the bodies? I mean if my client was clever enough not to leave any DNA in the car, why was he so stupid to leave so much DNA in the farmhouse? The answer madam, is he was never in that car and he is not denying he was in the house. See, mystery solved. No more questions, your honour. We are pathetic! We need evidence that puts Veer Singh directly at the scene of the crime. What's the update on the Blood DNA found inside the boy's mouth? We're awaiting results from Hyderabad. Ask them to cook it and eat it if they can't send it before the next hearing. No one goes home until we get the evidence. That includes you, Mr. Singh. This case is slipping away. You understand? Slipping away. I'm sorry Shobha is not able to join us. Thank you. She has a bad chest infection and these strong medicines put one to sleep instantly. Your case is becoming very entertaining, Kishore. It's funny how Jaisingh is both the hare and the tortoise here. I wonder how I'd have countered him if I was the public prosecutor. Kishore! Kishore! Open the door, Kishore! She started drinking again. She had passed out when you came. You are a good man, Kishore. Anyone else and he would have dumped her or hidden her away. I did try to hide her away. But I love her. And I will help her heal. Let's begin today's proceedings. Your honour, prosecution would like to re-call Maya Kanwal the DNA expert. We have new DNA evidence. Objection your honour. The defence have not been informed of this. Please approach the bench. I am informing you now. What? Really? Yes. What's the big deal? It's absolutely absurd. What is this new evidence and why has Mr. Jaisingh not been informed about it? The breakthrough came last night your honour. We had no time to inform the defence. We have blood DNA that is extremely incriminating. See for yourself. Here are the findings. I mean, I don't know. We need time to study this. I mean, I would say three weeks. You have ten days. Your honour, it's impossible. That is all. You may call the witness you were scheduled to call. Yashpal Sharma, take the stand. I swear to say the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Please state your name and occupation for the record? I am Yashpal Sharma. I am 41 years old. I used to be an officer in the Security forces. Now I have a real estate business in Delhi. What is your relationship with Veer Singh? We were friends. We did our training in the forces together. Did you also work together? Yes, sir. We both were posted in Kashmir. But Veer soon started working under cover for intelligence. So you stopped working together after that? No sir. I got shot during an operation. When I recovered Veer got me to work with him, undercover. Veer was posing as Ranjit, a journalist for an international news company. I was his photographer. How would you describe Veer Singh as an officer? He was a trained assassin. Completely ruthless. Excellent in disguise and impersonation. Veer would use any means to achieve his ends. Objection your honour. Baseless allegations. Please your honour, we are just laying the ground to establish Veer Singh's fascination with children. If that is your intention then please get to the facts quickly. Okay, your honour. Can you tell the court about the incident which made you see Veer Singh's dark and ugly side? We were tracking a businessman who was involved in terrorist funding. We found out this man's weakness. Children. Veer managed to meet the businessman and while leaving he very cleverly... Oh sorry, sorry. Sorry. Nice. You like children? A lot. You can keep these. I'll see you soon. Sir, just looking at pictures is only making my eyesight worse. They are so innocent and fresh at this tender age. Delhi is the place to get them fresh. If you want I can bring you the delights of Delhi right here. Then one day I learnt that the police arrested the businessman and his servant. They had found bodies of two migrant children behind the cottage. They were buried in the land. The businessman swore he was innocent and the children were procured and killed by Ranjit. But Ranjit was nowhere to be found. After that headquarters ordered me back. You know Veer told them I had masterminded it. It's against our code of honour. So I had to resign. No further questions, your honour. Your witness. Mr. Sharma, are you aware that the officials are not going to comment as these are matters of national security? Yes, sir. So these stories could be a figment of your imagination. Objection, your honour. Overruled. You want to save yourself by accusing Veer of such a hideous crime. I have only told the truth. A woman had handed over children to him. Hmm. Children. Have you ever seen Veer hurt a child or say nasty things about a child? No, sir. The whole platoon was exposed and pinned under by enemy fire. Everybody retreated on orders. Except Veer Singh. He risked his life and carried wounded officer Yashpal Sharma back to safety. This is from the certification for Veer Singh's gallantry award. Do you remember that? No, sir. Excuse me? No? You don't remember someone saving your life? I get the feeling that you hate Veer Singh. Do you? Would you like to see him hang? Kill the man who saved your life? What is it? You have no clue about the person you are defending. Veer is a snake. A wolf in sheep's clothing! All his success has other people's blood on it, sir. I lost everything because of him. Silence. He's a murderer! He's a bloody murderer! - He needs to be punished. - Sir, please. I urge you, sir. Sir, punish him. This court is now adjourned. Seems like we have our first real challenge. Veer, they have isolated and identified the blood DNA found in the boy's mouth. It's a match to your DNA, Veer. I need to get a DNA lab to verify their findings so I can create doubt about the match percentage. Which is possible, but it's also expensive. Because I need to use a lab in the United States. Any questions? Don't worry, I will pay for it. No, I will pay for it. You've done a lot for me. Already Thank you very much. No, it's booked. Sir! Sir! Holy shit. What the hell happened? He was beaten up very badly. Thank God he somehow managed to keep his head protected, or he would have been dead. How is he? Hooked up on life support. The prosecution wishes to continue with the proceedings. You want a win that badly, eh? You think that DNA is going to do it for you? Don't be so sure. Mr. Jaisingh. It is unethical to deny a man a chance to defend himself. Who's denying him defence? You are his defence. You will be there. Mr. Jaisingh shouldn't forget that his client denied himself the right to be present by starting a fight and getting himself beaten up. It's just a trick to slow down the trial. That is a cynical thing to say. The man might die. Which will give you the verdict you wanted without winning the case. You are a good man, Mr. Kumar. Don't become an amoral bastard like me who can stoop to any level. Your job is also to defend the rights of the accused you are prosecuting. My client has the right to be present in the court. Don't trample over that. We'll continue the trial when Mr. Jaisingh's client is released from hospital. Yes, sir. You know what's the best thing about alcoholics anonymous meetings? It widens your drinking circle. What am I doing here, Kishore? Why am I here? Because you wanted to be here. What am I going to do after I get sober anyway? I'd feel more scared. Why? You can always practice law. It's a high that is better than alcohol. And as far as fear is concerned, we're all scared. Shobha? How about a quick drink before I leave? Give it to me. Go. There is no ethics in Indian politics anymore. Everything has boiled down to perception and elections. Excuse me. Hello? What? What's wrong with Veer? What is it doctor? Well, his physical recovery has been very good. But his mind... refuses to wake up. In the beginning we thought it was a normal case of trauma. It's quite common in such cases. Especially if one's life is interrupted so violently. But one night we realized that there might be a deeper problem. This room belongs to someone called Veer Singh. - It's not my room. - What are you doing out here? - Go inside I say. - My room's out there. Go inside! The very next morning after this incident, our matron encountered another episode which was even more confusing. Oh. What is troubling you? I can't remember my name. What's my name? You are Veer Singh. His actions became completely illogical. Totally capricious. Then he was completely unpredictable and aggressive. We had no option but to sedate him. After he healed he was passive for a few days. He wouldn't talk to anyone, but there were no dramatic episodes. Then one day I came on my visit and I saw that... They are so dirty. Can I get something to clean them? Nail clipper. I'll send it over. I came back in the evening to check on him. I was taking his pulse I noticed his finger nails. They had been beautifully shaped. But the biggest shock came when I asked him to walk. There was a change in his body language. It wasn't the walk of an officer. The masculine body movements were now more subtly gentle and graceful. Then one morning his memory about his identity came back. I remember my name. It has always been on the tip of my tongue. I'm so happy. Oh wonderful. So what is your name? Charu. Charu Raina. You know I used to have long, lustrous hair. And that night the Matron saw something that made her blood run cold. Can I see him? Sure. Excuse us. How are you feeling, Veer? Okay. Listen Veer, this kind of play acting is not going to help. They are not going to pardon you so easily for the murder of two children. In fact, it will work against all the victories we have had in court. I know they have strong DNA evidence. But like I said, we have a good chance of raising reasonable doubt against it. Now stop this, okay? Who is he? Who are you? Just stop it! Calm down, please. Your name is Veer Singh. I am Charu Raina. I told you I am Charu Raina! The court won't believe you. Okay? You will have to finish the trial. They wouldn't care whether you go there as Veer Singh or...this Just when my mind is remembering things... Good. What are you remembering? Hmm? What are you remembering? Taking the bus to college. Do you remember which college? Which college? The Gov. College for Women in Ambala. I was studying there. No matter what you remember, you will be taken from this hospital back to prison. Prison is a very cruel place. And you know that. Like this? You need to be Veer Singh to survive it. I won't go to prison. Come what may, I won't go there. Jesus. This is a low down, dirty trick. You said you are an amoral bastard, but this? Your father was a legend whose books we have all read and you... These games and theatrics are making a mockery of the legal process. Please control yourself, Mr. Kumar. What do you want, Mr. Jaisingh? Am I on trial here? What do you want? I don't know, sir. Contrary to what you believe, I had no hand in this. Then I will instruct the court to set a date. Just one more thing, Veer Singh now calls himself Charu Raina. Calls herself Charu Raina. He can call himself whatever he wants. For this court he will always be Veer Singh. Sweetheart. Let's go, darling. Baby doll. Come on, darling. I'll show you a good time. Hey you, come on stand up. Me? Yes, you. Come on. They are troubling me. Okay, I'll handle it. Hi. Am I free to go? Remember me? Look at me, sweetheart! Yo baby girl! Buzz off. You there, leave. I don't want to pee. Can I leave? Can you drop me home? I'll send some kohl over. It'll make your eyes look beautiful. All rise for the Judge. It is him. He's just pretending to be a victim. What's going on? Silence. Go back to your seats. If there is any disturbance, I will clear the court. Please get back to your seats. Prosecution? Your honour, the prosecution calls Maya Kanwal. Maya Kanwal, take the stand. Madam, please be aware you are still under oath to this court. Yes, sir. Would you please tell the court about the new DNA finding? We've got a very credible match to the blood DNA found on the skin substance in the boy's mouth. Whose DNA does it match with? Veer Singh. Be loud and clear. Whose DNA does it match with? Veer Singh. It matches with Veer Singh's DNA. Silence, please. Any scope for doubt? - Absolutely not. - Absolutely not. Defence, your witness. Where are you going? - Going home. - No, sit here. Come on, sit down. What's wrong? What was the percentage of the match, madam? 70%. Which is excellent given the fire and other degradation. You are aware some horrible mistakes have been made by DNA experts? That depends on the skill set. Fair enough. How would you rate the skills of Michael Schwartz from the FBI labs? He is one of the best in the world. In fact, there is so much I have learnt from him. It's good to know. Because according to him it is only a 50 % match. If I spent five minutes with him, I would move him to 70%. And if I spent time with him it would bring it down to 20%. And that is exactly what worries me, madam. Science is meant to be accurate. Otherwise it is just like astrology. 50-50 chances. You can appease one force and placate the other and create favourable conditions. Thank you. Your honour, may I remind the defence that he was the one who started the quibbling about percentages? What is certain is that science is accurately pointing the finger of blood DNA at the accused Veer Singh here. Whether it is 50% or 70%, the point... Excuse me? That's not my name. What did you say? What is it? I am Charu Raina. We used to go to college on a bicycle in Ambala. You don't need to say anything. - No, please carry on. - You know, in the prison that man with the patch, he... Want to go home. But... I want to go home. I... I want to go home. Can I go home? - No. - Can we go home? Your honour, you can see better acting... ...on the streets than what Veer Singh is putting up here. Hey! Hey! No. What are you doing? Shit. Get a doctor. Everyone, please get back to your seats. This is not my blood. - It is dirty. It needs to be... - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop this. What? I warned you guys. Your honour, my client is suffering severe trauma. Trauma or drama? Your honour, why? Why would he act as a woman and allow himself to be raped everyday in Jail? The gangster whose eye he put out, now owns Charu as his mistress. Then I must send him back to the hospital. Your honour, he is making up stories and trying to mislead... How many witnesses does the prosecution have left? We have a bite mark expert coming up. After that... I demand a mistrial. What did you say, Mr. Jaisingh? Declare a mistrial, your honour. And dismiss all charges against my client. Are you out of your mind? Your client is being tried for a double murder. Yes, he is. But, that man in court is not my client. He just looks like my client. Everyone in the court saw what happened out there. Till my client returns this trial cannot continue. I request you your honour to rule that the accused is wilfully absconding and conduct the trial in absentia. You can't do that. Because the body of my client is present in court. But his personality is not there. Legally speaking, he is both present and absent. He makes no sense, your honour. And may I go further to say that since the law is clear that a person is innocent till proven guilty, I request you to set my client's body free as it has not been judged guilty. This is legal terrorism, your honour. This is unacceptable. The first call of law is to ascertain if your client is really missing or is pretending to be missing. The court will appoint a renowned psychiatrist to conduct the examination One that will be absolutely neutral. A small gift for you. Wow. It will suit you, Charu. What... what did you say? Charu. Oops. You escaped. Yes? A mistrial? What is this nonsense? It is what my client needs. It's not what the party needs. Don't forget, we are your client, not Veer Singh. Fuck the party. Keep your Rajya Sabha seat. I won't kiss ass like you did. Meet Dr. Nandy from the National Institute of Mental health. - Mr. Sid Jaisingh, for the defence. - Nice to meet you. - Mr. Amit Kumar, for the prosecution. - Pleased to meet you. He has agreed to help us in this case. Besides helping you, I would also be helping myself. By learning something more about a very mysterious disorder. Dissociative Identity Disorder. This is characterised by the maintenance of at least two distinct personalities. The personalities alternately take charge of a person's behaviour. In the case of Veer Singh it seems that one personality has taken over exclusively. Obviously doctor. Because it is a scam. I suggest we let Dr. Nandy do his job. He's the expert. Dr. Nandy, this new personality in my client cannot remember why he/ she is here. Well the fact is dissociative identity disorder is characterised by dramatic memory gaps. It's one of its symptoms. Interesting. Do you mean each personality might only remember things relevant to that personality? Yes. Wow. I am getting Goosebumps. We need to investigate if there was a traumatic event in Veer Singh's childhood? The practice of learning how to dissociate as a defence happens in childhood. This could be one clue as to whether he is acting or not. Don't worry. I am Doctor Nandy. I am here to help you. What can I call you? I am Charu. Charu. Charu Raina. Hello, Charu. How old are you? I am 32. Where are you from? I live in Kashmir with my husband and... son. What is your husband's name Charu? Vinod Raina. I miss my son a lot. So why are you not home with your husband and son, Charu? What are you doing here? I don't know, sir. I... I must've been sick. You know. I woke up in hospital. When I got better, I was taken to jail. I swear, I have not done anything. They say that you are Veer Singh and are accused of raping and murdering two young children. I want to go home. I am not... Can you call my husband? Call him, he'll come and pick me up. I don't want to stay here. If you can tell me how to get in touch with your husband, I will ask him to come. 8452086695, his mobile number. Can you repeat that again please? 8452086695. Call him. He'll come and get me. Sir. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Hello sir, am I speaking to Mr. Vinod Raina? Can I talk to him? Can I, please? Ask him how is Jhumru doing? We are very sorry to disturb you. I am Judge Bhushan from Lucknow. Are you married to a lady called Charu Raina? Can I talk to him? Ask him how is Jhumru doing? We need your help. Could you please come to Lucknow? He was married to Charu. She ran away from Kashmir. This is none of his business. He says he won't come. But I will summon him. Sir. Can I get some nail polish? My nails look dirty. I need to... No tea, Balram. Okay, sir. Oh. Hi, Judge. The doctor asked me to stay hydrated. I just drank water. But I think I am turning water into wine inside me. Look at your face, Kishore. Just teasing you, Judge. Come on, you need to lighten up. I know this case is worrying you. But you know something? However you decide, Whatever you decide, this is the judgement you will be famous for. I dreamed of you last night, killing those children. I don't know what the truth is. I don't know what decision the judge will take. All I know is, you are broken. I understand that. So, now I'll fight this case for you, Charu. Listen... You are very handsome. You are lonely, aren't you? Call the mechanic, please. Sir, I am sorry for saying I won't come. I thought this was a trick. How can Charu's soul be in another man's body? I don't understand. Sir, I am married again and have another child. So this is... Please relax. Dr. Nandy here is going to help us solve this problem. Did you bring a photograph of your first wife? Yes. Here you go. How did you meet Charu? It was an arranged marriage, sir. I was 20 years older than her. She was not from a rich family. I agreed because she was young and beautiful. Who doesn't want a woman like that? Which year did you two married? 12th April 2007, sir. I brought our marriage certificate along. No. Not necessary. When was your child born? 1st December, 2008. You can have a look at this. No. No need. Kapil, right? Who came up with the name? My mother. Could you tell us what your marriage was like? Not good, sir. We were not suited for each other. When did she run away? About ten years ago, sir. I made a police complaint and all. I have... No, no. This man, this woman actually gave us the same information you gave us. Only he/she doesn't remember leaving Kashmir. I don't know anything, sir. But I am not taking her back in any shape or form. I am happily married, sir. I have another child. How can I... I cannot take her back, sir. We are now going to call this person in. Don't worry. You can go and sit over there. Make him sit there. Be careful. - Make him sit there. - Sit! Are you alright? You've got dark circles. I told you, you should have turmeric in milk at night. Look at me. I'll look better once my hair grows back. Where is Jhumru? You didn't bring him along? Music exam. He's into music? He sings? Did you teach him the song I used to sing? The one you didn't like. You know... Where is he going? I have to go with him. My God, fascinating. Fascinating? What's fascinating? This isn't a movie. Your honour, why are we not asking the right questions? Why did Veer Singh pick this woman Charu to turn into? How did he know her? The Charu person gets upset when she is referred to as Veer. How do we investigate this? That's easy, your honour. We need to give the accused a narco analysis test. Sure. Let's do it. But there is a problem. My client has to give his consent to that and he is not present in case you haven't noticed yet. There's another option. Hypnosis. It is non-invasive but effective especially in awakening suppressed memories. We can give it a try. Don't worry. This is only to help you. Relax. Relax your body. Relax your mind. Think about the beautiful skies in Kashmir. Vast blue skies. Feel the wet grass. Feel the wind blowing. The lake. Think about things that make you happy. Relax. Count backwards with me. 100, zero... 99, zero... 98, zero... 97, zero... Can we go to the time when you just got married? He was an old man. Stupid and boring. I hated him. But he was my husband. I had no choice but to go home and into his bed every night. I got pregnant. What do you remember about time you were pregnant? I felt sad, lonely. Thinking this was going to be my life forever. I was 20. I kept falling sick. Sad, sick, lonely. Did you ever think of meeting another man and actually falling in love? Ranjit. You sing well. Thank you. Hey girl, what happened to the songs? Why are you not singing? What happened? What business is it of yours? Well, it is my business. Counting on you I didn't bring any music. Whose baby is that? Mine. Don't lie. I swear. I was just confirming. It's just that you don't look like you have a baby. Your husband is a lucky fellow. You better tell him that. I don't think he knows it. What are you doing? You can't just do that. I'll tell him. He's not home anyway. Okay, I'll be back tomorrow. Don't forget to sing or I'll come across the fence. Name? Ranjit. And you are? Charu. Charu Raina. Thank you for the keys. You need to be punished for leaving them in the car. What do you suggest? "Falling off the branch on to the clouds," "Blame the audacious weather." "Going with the flow of the lake," "Blame the mischievous weather." I had gone too far with him. And I didn't want to return. "Take me," "Somewhere far away," "Where the eyes can express the unsaid." "Resting on the carpet of fresh dew," "Blame the audacious weather." "Disappearing in the peaks like an echo," "Blame the audacious weather." What happened to you? Look at them. I wish I could do something for those kids. I know where they park their cart and sell things. I could give them some clothes, food. Do that. I gave them some food and clothes. But I knew, Ranjit wanted so much more for them. Which I could do nothing about. But he was a magician. Listen... I just met a rich businessman. He supports a boarding school for underprivileged children in Mussorie. I can get those kids into that school. Yes, you can. But I don't think the parents will trust a strange man. They shouldn't. I think I can convince them. - You think you can? - Yes. I convinced their parents quite easily. Ranjit felt it best only I should deal with the parents as they trusted me. I gave them the address and the phone number of the school. And kept a copy on my phone. Ranjit picked up the kids from an appointed place. We were so happy, we had given two children a future. The parents moved to another place to make a living. One day, I went to meet my friend, at the other end of the town. While I was walking back... I got the shock of my life. I saw the boy who was supposed to be in school, peering out of a window. I felt he had recognised me. And was accusing me of betraying him. I am not blind or stupid. I saw him. How could it be? I dropped the children to the van myself. Trust me. I called the school. The phone doesn't connect. I'm going to the police. Wait, wait, wait. We both will go to the police. But what if we are wrong? We'll be destroying the reputation of a good man. I will find out if the children are safe, okay? If they are not, we both will go to the police. But I was restless. I wrote to the school. Ever got your eyes examined? Why? You should. I met the kids. They are happy. Stupid girl. - You had me scared. - Sorry. ADDRESS NOT FOUND I told the police everything but left Ranjit's name out of it. I was in love with him. They raided that businessman's house and arrested him and his servant. I'm not an idiot, Ranjit. I will go and tell the police I gave the kids to you. My name is Veer Singh and not Ranjit. I am an undercover agent for the security forces. I couldn't tell you that. That businessman got away because of you. I... If you hadn't reacted like you did we would have saved those children and other children. I have failed. I have never lied to you. What kind of a person are you? Who are you? Forgive me for not telling you everything. I didn't want to lose you. You are everything to me. "Take me," "Somewhere far away," "Where the eyes can express the unsaid." Then he took me in his arms, He held me very tenderly for a few moments, And then he broke my neck. - Surprise! - Surprise, dad! Look at what Dhruv won. Crowman the lawman gets justice every time. Dhruv won the fancy dress contest. I wish I really was 'Crowman the lawman.' Who says you aren't? For us, you are our Superhero. And always will be. Kevin. Yes, sir? One second. This is for you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Do you pray? Yes, sir. Can you say a prayer for me? Sir, I only know church prayers. I'm sure God understands all prayers. Just say one. Our father, who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done. 'On earth as it is in heaven.' 'Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins,' 'as we forgive those who sin against us.' 'Do not bring us to the test, but deliver us from evil.' 'Amen.' All rise for the Judge. This case has taken a strange turn. Instead of deciding whether the accused is innocent or guilty, we are hearing arguments as to whether the trial should be called off or not. Arguments may change based on the direction of the wind. But our decisions must be firm. Serving only the cause of Justice. Please proceed with the closing statements, Prosecution. The defence is asking for a mistrial, your honour. That is totally unfair to the people who are relying on this court to give them justice. It is also unfair on the children who are no longer with us. The prosecution has proven everything, your honour. The crimes were committed on the accused's property. His DNA was present on the bodies. And more importantly the accused's blood DNA was found in the dead boy's mouth. Yet the court isn't giving him the punishment he deserves because... Because the trial has taken a bizarre turn. The defence wants us to blindly believe this sham. That is impossible, your honour. The accused is pretending to be a woman who he says was the love of his life, in Kashmir, ten years ago. So picking up her ways and mannerisms was the easiest thing in the world. The accused is a highly trained spy. And my question to those who believe that he is Charu now, why did Charu not recognise Veer's face in the mirror? Why? Veer was the love of her life. It's because Veer didn't want her to say that. Because he is the writer, the hero and the heroine of the story he has weaved. 'Villain' would be more appropriate. In the hypnosis session, this Charu said Veer strangled her to death, in the call of duty. So with one stroke, he became the murderer and the murdered Your honour, this is nothing but a trick to mislead the court. The prosecution maintains that the accused who is among us is a very cunning and a cruel man. He is pretending to be suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder. It's just an act, your honour. A sham! Which in itself is a terrible slight and injustice to all the people who actually suffer from these conditions and yet continue to contribute to the society. Your honour, We urge you to proceed with the trial so the court can find him guilty for the rape and cold blooded murder of the two children and give him the highest punishment possible. He deserves death by hanging. That's all, your honour. Defence? Your honour, the prosecution claims to have proven everything, Whereas the defence has already proven that they were nothing but claims. Veer Singh has always had faith in the law. He never said that some other personality in him committed the crime. Never. The prosecution believes that Veer is putting up an act. What act? And why? Why would Veer do it? Why would he confess to murdering Charu? There can be only two reasons for it. One, that Veer is stupid, which he isn't. And the prosecution has proven that time and again. Or, that Veer does suffer from DID, Dissociative Identity Disorder. Where the mind splits and shuts out one personality and introduces another in order to deal with a stressful situation. According to doctors, in such patients, there can be multiple personalities inhabiting one body. In fact, the court appointed psychiatrist Dr. Nandy told us that, if there is a traumatic even during childhood, children, develop the DID mechanism to help them cope. When we investigated Veer's past, we learnt that Veer lost his mother at the tender age of three. Dr. Nandy says it is quite possible that Veer blamed himself for her death. Then in Kashmir while he was serving the nation, And I would like to repeat that. While he was serving the nation, he had to sacrifice Charu. Your honour, the prosecution has questioned why Charu didn't recognise Veer in the mirror? I guess the prosecution has forgotten that Charu didn't even remember she had a lover till she was under hypnosis. Yet to clarify it further to the court and to clear the doubts of the prosecution, I would further explain why Charu didn't recognise Veer in the mirror. According to Dr. Nandy, Our brain voluntarily forgets or suppresses the sad and traumatic experiences. In medical terms, they are called 'suppressed memories' So Charu may have forgotten about Veer. But what's remarkable to know, your honour is that Veer had not forgotten about Charu. So in a moment of extreme trauma when he was being falsely accused of murder. When his reputation was being publicly destroyed. When he was beaten up to within an inch of his life by gangsters in prison, he was raped, his mind snapped and he adopted the safest personality he knew. Charu Raina. Because in his mind he must have believed that she would protect him. Or maybe he was guilty about taking her life and wanted to give her life in his own body. In a way, the prosecution has got their wish. They are demanding a death sentence for Veer. And Veer is no more. This case killed Veer. Veer is dead. So who should we put on trial? Or, who is this trial against? Therefore, I humbly request this court to declare this trial a mistrial. We will take a short recess. The court will resume and pass judgement in one hour. 'Treat the accused the way you treated your ex-alcoholic wife. 'and yet you never stopped doubting her.' 'Hmm?' I have never faced such a moral and legal dilemma before. The prosecution and the defence have both argued their positions powerfully. But This case has raised a profound question, who commits a crime? The mind or the body? The body is only a mechanism. A tool, run by the mind. It follows the instructions of the mind. The body always does what the mind instructs it to do. Therefore just the body cannot be held guilty of a crime. Today the body that might have committed the crimes is here, but the mind that is accused of these heinous crimes is not. Therefore, in executing the court's responsibility towards the victims and the accused, I have decided to adjourn the trial indefinitely. I hereby adjourn this case indefinitely. Silence, please. I also decree that Veer Singh be held and treated at a Government hospital for mental health. He should be under strict surveillance. And during this time, if Veer Singh's personality reappears even for a moment, he will immediately charged for the rape and murder of Shyam and Shyamala Yadav. In that should happen, we will resume the trial immediately and all the evidence presented so far will be taken into account against the accused. Whether he comes to the court as Charu or any other personality. It took a while for everyone to understand the impact of this landmark judgment. But eventually, everyone praised Judge Bhushan's intellect. The case was not completed and yet it was completed, thanks to the wisdom of the judge. If the accused is not trying to cheat the court, he has a chance to heal and then appear again for a fair trial. But, if the accused is cheating the court then he will have to spend the rest of his life trapped in the personality, that he has created.
