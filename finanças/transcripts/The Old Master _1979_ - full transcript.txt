Mr Ding. What's your deal? You owe us money and keep stalling. How can 1 explain it to our boss? The westerners are not to be trifled with. Are you trying to get me in trouble? Brother Wah. 1 didn't mean to. The money that you lent me - 1 spent it all betting on the favourite horse. It should've been the best bet. 1 didn't expect that the jockey would fall off his horse in the last few paces before the finishing line. - What can 1 do? - Nonsense. That's why it's called gambling. Brother Wah, please help. You know that 1 only own one martial arts gym. Business has been bad lately. 1 can't get many new students. Why are all the other gyms doing so well? Of course. Look at you, gambling all day without practising Kung Fu. You look like an idiot. Who would learn Kung Fu from you? Now I'm giving you an ultimatum. You have three months to settle your debt. Or... I'll treat you like a horse with a broken leg and put you down! Grandmaster YU JIM-YUEN and his Seven Little Fortunes students Starring: Yuen Hung, Yuan Nan, Yuan Qi, Yuan Xiao, Yuan Fu, Yuan Hsin, Yuan Fa Starring: Bill Louie (Karate Seventh Dan Champion) David Pedernera (Taekwondo Seventh Geup Master) Cameos by: Starr Hester (American TV Star) Ng Siu-Nam, Pau Ga-Chung Produced and Directed by: Joseph Kuo Nan-Hong Executive Director: Wong Chim-Yung Are you Master Wan? Mr Dingson is unwell and he can't come. He asked me to pick you up. Master Wan, please get out of the car. So this is Chinatown? You can't get to Chinatown that easily, old man. Don't scare me. What? Do 1 need 10 take a plane to Chinatown? I've flown more than 10 hours from Hong Kong. 1 can't sit on a plane anymore. Cut the crap, old man. - Are you trying to rob me? - No. - Is it easy to bully an old man? - No. - Would you dare next time? - No. Out of my face! Excuse me. How can 1 get to Chinatown? What? Do you know how to speak English? Chinatown? No, 1 don't understand what you're saying, sorry. We can't understand each other because you're not Chinese. Hi. Hi. - Darling. - Susan. He's standing here for a while. Can you help this old man? Do you know where Chinatown is? - Chinatown? - Yes. Get in the car. 1 can give you a ride. Thanks. Sir, this is the Huaqi Martial Arts Gym that you're looking for. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Master. This is for you. Why are you still standing here? - Do your job. - Yes. Flying for more than ten hours 1 didn't get a chance to drink Chinese tea. Nice. This tea is so good. Hey! Come here. I'd like to introduce you to two of my best students. Her name is Fang. This one is called Jin Wei. Call him Master! Master! This kid looks exactly like you. Just like another you. It's good that you're here. We were too late to pick you up. We were so worried about you. Our master was about to call the police. Speaking of which it's all because of this idiot. It's difficult to get petrol and he forgot to get it yesterday. Then the petrol ran out halfway. After filling up the car and arriving at the airport. We couldn't find you there. Where have you been? See, you haven't changed a bit. You just can't stop talking. As soon as I left the airport someone told me you're unwell. So he was asked to pick me up at the airport. 1 was almost mugged halfway. If I didn't have a few tricks up my sleeve 1 would've been in trouble. Master. So how did you get here? 1 had my own way. Dingson, why did you write to me and ask me to come to the US? It's a long story. It's been alright in the martial arts gym I run. Then some newbies joined and caused trouble every day. 1 couldn't find a way to fix this so 1 turned to you for help. 1 know, it must be those guys who tried to pick up Master today! It's unacceptable. I'll teach them a lesson. Right. Easy, young man. You should learn to be tolerant. Don't mention fighting or killing from now on, Jin Wei. With all this trouble, you better change your career. To what? Why run a martial arts gym? You can still be a master running a restaurant. - What sort of master? - Master Chef. Third aunt asked me to bring you this dried veg for you to make a good soup and reduce inflammation. Thanks. Make some soup for him too to calm his anger. The mushrooms are from me. Thanks. Oh right. These medicines work on many illnesses. I've heard medical costs are high in the US. 1 think they would be of use. - That's very thoughtful of you. - Master! Master. Master. Master. They stopped us in the street and beat us up again. They also said if you don't give up your martial arts gym they'd beat us every time they see us. Why don't we just fight them? Come back! Haven't you seen this man? What have 1 taught you? Being tolerant is precious. Don't you know what it means? How many times have 1 told you? If someone hits you on the cheek offer him the other also. Understood? Jin, go and ask them what they want. If it comes to the worst, I will quit. Go quickly. Just go! These people are going too far. 1 can't just stand by and watch. Are they all out? Good morning Master. Please have a seat. This is today's Chinese newspaper. Master, tea? You're a student here too? Yes. I'm Bill. But I'm different from other students. What's the difference? I'm here to learn Kung Fu but 1 don't have to pay tuition. You must be well-respected. I'm not. 1 can't afford to pay for tuition actually. That's why I'm working here a few hours a day for tuition. Very well. Young people should be hardworking. How long have you been learning Kung Fu? I've only been here for 10 days. Oh just started? You have a nice physique. You seem to have practised martial arts before. I'm looking for a master to enhance my skills. That is quite a statement. Looking for a master to enhance your skills. I learnt Karate and Judo. Now I want to learn Kung Fu too. You know what? Karate and Judo used to be Chinese Kung Fu too. In the Tang Dynasty - it was introduced to Japan. - Then it's been 300 years. Over 1,300 years! Don't just learn Kung Fu. You should study some history too. Master. You're all here. We've been waiting for you for a long time. Don't break your promise. You have no right to say that. How could you leave him alone? He doesn't speak English. If something goes wrong, the whole plan is ruined. Anyway, he got there safely. Nothing went wrong so far. Where's the money, by the way? Oh. Don't let anyone see you. Leave through the back door. OK. I'll go now. - Master. - Yes? What about us? We acted pretty well yesterday in that scene, didn't we? Master. We've spent a lot of money on fake blood. Otherwise how would the old man believe it? Master. Please take the drink. What's our next move? Let other martial arts gyms challenge us. - No problem. - We'll take care of it. Master. Remember the debts you owed to the westerners? You'll have to find a way to settle it. Of course 1 will settle it. It's heartbreaking to lose all this money. Wait. What do you mean? Right. That's a good way to make money. If they see the Master being so old they'd be willing to make a huge bet. I'll take care of it. Master's kung fu is invincible. But it's not fair to do this to him, right? In my opinion he doesn't know about all this and he's promised to help us. Good. No matter what, you must keep this from Master. If anyone tells him you'd be in trouble. Remember that? Mr Liu. Let's not have this fight today. Master Wan, get ready. Bring it on. Mr Wang. From what 1 can see there isn't a dispute between Huaqi Martial Arts Gym and you. Let's spare ourselves this fight today. Master, I'm not stirring up troubles with your gym today. 1 know that you are from Hong Kong. 1 respect you. 1 hope Master can give me some advice on Kung Fu. Good. Let's do three rounds then. Stop when the game is set. Thank you, Master. Watch this move. Round one is over. Second round. Third round. Master's Kung Fu is really eye-opening. I admit defeat. I'm sorry for offending you. Mr Wang, you're welcome. Everybody, take a break. - You made a wrong move just now. - You're slacking. Good. Master. You've worked hard today. You deserve to drink more. Those guys are nothing to Master. Master, here's a toast to you. You guys should stop saying that. If I didn't see you being bullied with my own eyes 1 wouldn't care one bit. Dingson. Is there something on your mind? No. It's nothing. Master. He has something on his mind. Another gym wanted to challenge us recently. He's very worried. Don't worry, Dingson. Since I'm here, 1 won't do anything. Just let them come for me. No, Master. You've suffered a lot for us. It doesn't feel right to ask for your help again. Come on, a toast to Master. Kung fu is about much more than just strength. It is not about winning or losing. In fact, Chinese Kung Fu is much deeper and more profound. Master Wan is rumoured to be unrivalled. I, Zhao Dajun, want to learn some tricks from you. Here I go. You've won a lot of money again this time, Master. - Your gambling debts... - Yes? ...are almost paid off. You've got a great idea. I've won a lot this time. If he finds out, he'd be furious. How would he know? You want to tell him? I'm not an idiot. We better find some good gyms to challenge him. They'd send out good fighters. Then they will make a huge bet. We can definitely get rich! It's better than betting on horse racing. At least he's got a good fighting spirit. Even though he's a little old he'd still fight with all he's got. Well, yes. I'm just worried that he can't keep going. The fights have barely begun. Why would you say that? It's me. I'm cleaning the living room. You don't have to clean now. Go downstairs and practise. Yes. The Huagqi Martial Arts Gym is getting famous now. They've won a lot of money by defeating other gyms. And now they're coming after us. Damn it. 1 never thought Dingson's master would be that good. Half of my students left for Huaqi Martial Arts Gym. Ever since the old man came. We've lost a lot of money. Dingson's debts are all settled because of this old man. Oh, right. We must come up with a plan to bring this old man down. This time 1 hired Mo Ali to fight him. He's got sharp eyes and can keep up with the old guy's leg moves. You're saying that this old man is good with his legs? In whatever circumstances he always wears a pair of canvas shoes. Wearing a pair of canvas shoes? Master. Master. Master. You can't really keep doing this. Bill, I can't just watch your master being bullied. If he loses face, I lose face. Master, but-- Speak up. Why the humming and hawing? 1 think you... What? You... Why are you hesitating, young man? Well. I'm afraid that you'll be angry. What? Angry? 1 beat others up. Why would 1 be angry? If you are beaten by someone then I'd be angry. Just say it. Master! Tell me what's going on. OK, I'll say-- Master! Things are getting serious. What happened this time? Now a big martial arts gym is challenging us. Master, they want to fight you particularly. I think you've already fought too hard these days. I'd better buy them some drinks and apologise to them on your behalf. Shut up. I will not surrender. Mr Ding, let's do what we agreed on today. The first to get pushed out of the circle loses. Wait a minute. What do you think, Master? Good. That's how 1 fought when 1 was young. Making friends through fights, it's what a gentleman does. Amazing. This is the referee. He's very famous here. His name is Bull Shit. Bull Shit? - How come I haven't heard of him? - It doesn't matter. It's the same whoever the referee is. It's a set up, let's fight them together! You two stop for a bit. You guys, go. How do you explain this to me? Master, 1 didn't want to do this. You know that I'm terrible at Kung Fu. To enhance the reputation of the martial arts gym 1 was forced to use you, Master. You're gambling with my life. Master, 1 was wrong. Please forgive me. Using my old bones to fight the others? How can 1 forgive you with just an apology? You bastard! Master, he has confessed. Please forgive him. Forgive him? Master, if people know what happened today they'd say that you aren't a good teacher. You're responsible for this too. Yes, 1 should be responsible. 1 should be responsible for punishing you scum bag. From now on, you are not my student anymore. I'm leaving too. Bye. Master! Master! It's my fault. 1 shouldn't have told you this. But it's not right to keep it from you either. You're a nice guy. - 1 should thank you actually. - Don't mention it. - Can 1 buy you dinner? - Yes. Thanks. What are you going to do next? I'd like to stay here for now. Good. 1 could show you around. I'm looking for a job. But I'm too old. Age is not a problem. 1 can help you get a job. Master, it's no problem to find a job. I'm a hotel co-manager. People come to me for anything including issues with bathrooms, doors or even the roof. Everyone here listens to me. 1 will get you a job. As soon as 1 talk to the manager. There would definitely be no problem. Rest assured. Let's go in. The manager is inside. What's the matter? This is my Kung Fu teacher Mr Wan. This is our manager. - How do you do? - He needs a job. OK, come on. Thanks. - Good, he has to sign here. - Thank you. Sit down please. Sit down. Master, what are you doing? He asked me to turn off the light. Oops. He didn't ask you to turn off the light. He asked you to sit down. Come in for a visit. This is my office now. It's a big mess. These are all tools here. This is an electric drill. 1 have many skills. No wonder you saved me with a chainsaw. This is the warehouse. This is where you work. I'll gradually take care of these things for you. You can stay at my place for now. Sorry for your trouble. You got me a job. And let me live in your house. Would it be inconvenient for you? No. You know what? I'm a big fan of Chinese Kung Fu. Now that 1 have you here you can teach me Kung Fu. 1 don't want to teach Kung Fu anymore. I fell for it once. I've had enough. Master, we can make a deal. You teach me some Kung Fu. 1 won't charge you rent. That's fair, right? Chinese Kung Fu is hard to learn. I'm not afraid of how hard it is. - Really? - It's a deal? Drive carefully. Save your life for your future wife. I have to keep my life to get back to Hong Kong. - Master, please come in. - Thank you. You see, I live here. The best thing here is this big yard. 1 can practise Kung Fu here every day. - The environment is not bad. - Not bad. You live in such a big house? - Alone? - No. It's the landlord's. And where do you live? 1 rented a small house in the back from the fat landlady. It's supposed to be storage for the landlord. It's dirty and smelly. But 1 like this big yard. 1 begged her for a long time. Then she rented it to me. 1 hope you don't mind. You'll get used to it. Master! It's too small in here. Are you still comfortable? It's not small. It would've cost me a lot in Hong Kong every month. That's right. Look, I won't charge you for the room. I'll let you sleep in my bed. I'll tidy up your room and wash the toilet. I'll do it all. You'd be looked after. 1 don't have anything to do other than practising Kung Fu. But you'd have to promise me one thing. - What is it? - Teach me Kung Fu. There you go again. I've told you that I stopped taking new students long time ago. I'm going to be your student. I just want to learn some Kung Fu. You make it sound easy. You should start at a young age. It's too hard for you now. Master. 1 do have some skills. I'm a sixth dan in karate. I'm a third dan in judo. 1 can do boxing too. I can also do the latest disco dance moves. I see that you know a lot. But let's talk about Kung Fu learning later. - Who's this? - It's me, Master. What's wrong with you? Staying up this late. Why is your face so close? Sorry. Master, I've heard from others that a skilled Kung Fu master doesn't breathe when he sleeps. Nonsense. If I'm not breathing, I'd be dead. I'm sorry, Master. OK. Don't talk nonsense here. Go to sleep now. No one has ever been that close to me except my wife. What the hell? Master. - Master! - What is it? 1 couldn't sleep. - Do you miss your wife? - No, 1 don't. I just want to learn Kung Fu. Oh my God. You never give up. Fine. If you can defeat me with the tricks you've learnt I'll teach you Kung Fu. OK. Thank you, Master. Good night! - What did you say? - It's "good night" in English. If we don't sleep soon we should say good morning. Oops. Yeah. My nose. Hey! Master. Oh. Master. 1 can't defeat you. Forget it. - I'm not gonna learn Kung Fu. - Get up. To settle my rent you might have to suffer a little. Let me teach you a few tricks tomorrow. Really? Thank you, Master. I've collected all the eggs, Master. Good. Put them back again. Harder. - Come here and try this move. - Yes. See? Practice. Master. Master. Very good. Kung Fu fighting. You, good! Wonderful. This is your salary. It's yours. Master! The manager was looking for you. Where did you go? I was out shopping. It's for you. Sigh. My birthday has already passed. Why did you get me a gift? 1 want to thank you for teaching me all that Chinese Kung Fu. Let me treat you at a disco, Master. Kicking dead dogs? What's the point of kicking a dead dog? No. Disco is the most popular and latest dancing style. I'm too old to make a fool of myself. A lot of older people dance disco too. It doesn't matter if you don't dance. Have some drinks. It's also fine to just look around. See something new. - Shall we? - Yes. Here's some new clothes 1 bought you. Thank you. - Hey, Bill. - Hey. Master. This is my girlfriend Laura. - Laura, this is my master. - Hello, Master. Let's go. Let's go. Master. Would you like to dance with me? If it was 40 years ago, I could dance with you. But 1 can't now. Kung Fu is like dancing. It's also moving arms and legs. You go ahead and dance. I'll stay and have a few more drinks. It's quite nice. Hi. Mary's here. Mary. - Hi, Mary 1 didn't expect 10 see you here. Are you here by yourself? No. My partner couldn't make it last minute. Why don't you come and sit with us? - Oh. - OK? - This your drink? Come on. - OK. You've drunk a lot, Master. Stop drinking. 1 got you a dance partner. Hello. How do you do? It just so happens that we are now four. Let's set up a table and play mahjong. Master. You're drunk. It's not like in Hong Kong, where everyone plays mahjong. Oh. Can't play mahjong? Does he want to dance? Yeah. With you! Aww. Come on. Let's go. Go dance. Do you want me to take you home first, honey? Master. Wake up. I'm winning at mahjong. What do you want? Are you dreaming, Master? Would you like more food, Master? - I've had enough. - Did you like the food? You've made some good food. - You're so lucky. - Huh? You have this pretty lady. What about me? 1 can only watch cartoons on TV. Your Loro is So nice. - Master. Not Loro, it's Laura. - Laura. Master, your friend came to see you. 1 don't have any friends here? - Hello. - Mary. You guys have a nice chat. We're going out. - Mary, enjoy yourselves. - Hi. - Bye. - Wait. You can't leave. I can't speak her language. Feelings are beyond words. No... Bye, Mary. See you. This is for you. - Sit down, sit down. - Thank you. Would you like some tea? Cha (tea). Cha (tea). Cha Cha? - No Cha Cha? - No. Sit down, sit down. Tea. Tea, thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you, thank you. Your home is very comfortable. You like Muhammad Ali? He's very strong. - Yes. - Yes, 1 like him too. Do you like Elvis? Do you like his songs? - Can you sing like Elvis? - Yes. Can you sing like Elvis? Yes, yes. Sing la la la la la like Elvis? Yes. OK. I sing like Elvis. - And you sing too. - Yes, yes. Are you ready? - Ok, 1 sing first and you sing. - Yes. OK. Now you sing? Yes, yes. Sing. La la la. - Yes? - Yes. Ask me to sing and dance I don't know any of this stuff What I do know is saying yes - Apple. Ah-po (granny). - It's apple. - Ah-po (granny). Not Ah-po (granny). I'm not that smart. Apple is Ah-po (granny). Banana is Bai-nainai (white granny). 1 can only remember it this way. Sit down. - Practising English? - You guys talk, I'll study. - You work hard. - Gotta work hard. Bill, you changed the paintings? Not me. It's Master. The day the fat landlady came, the bed collapsed. The wall got dirty too. That's funny. Don't be absurd. 1 have a wife in Hong Kong. Bill, I went to the park to look for you just now. 1 thought you went running. Oh, wait a sec. I'll go right now. Master. Come run with me? - Running? - Yes. What are we running for? Running is the best exercise. It can prevent high blood pressure heart attack insomnia, constipation and rheumatism loss of appetite, and... Alright, alright. If running helps cure diseases all doctors are gonna lose their jobs. Master! I'm just stating the facts. 1 also run during my holidays. There's an article written by a doctor in today's newspaper which specified the benefits of running. It's alright. Daily Kung Fu and meditation are better than anything. Master! 1 know you're in good health. But running every day can give you better health. There's no need to say more. I'm not used to this stuff. What's going on? 1 know you're a bit old, Master. Probably can't run anymore. It's better to just meditate. I'm going now. Bye. Let's go. Master. After that big fight, I'm sorry. I can't keep you any longer. Here's the payment for you two due today. Thank you. Bill, we've just got paid. Why is he paying us again? I'm sorry, Master. It's all my fault. - I got you fired too. - It's okay. 1 was going to quit anyway. Why? 1 was working to get money for the flight ticket back to HK. I've got enough money now. What am 1 staying here for? So don't be sad. You go back to HK. I'll be sad here. Where should I go? To find my true self? Let the past be the past I don't want to be lost here I'm not gonna be aimless I'm not gonna feel sad and helpless Master. What is it? I've heard that some people are heading to Huaqi Martial Arts Gym. Dingson is resourceful. His gym has a lot of people. He can handle it. But this time they won't be holding back! They lost at the hotel last time. To get their revenge I'm sure they will hire plenty of masters there. Masters? Don't worry, Dingson knows many Kung Fu and combat skills. 1 taught him everything. They won't be defeated easily. But there are too many of them. And they're all masters. Ding is definitely no match for them. 1 think this time Huaqgi Martial Arts Gym is doomed. Dingson gave up his morality for money and disrespected the Kung Fu morality. 1 really regret teaching him Kung Fu. It'd be good if his gym is defeated. Master, Dingson is your student. If he is defeated, you'd be embarrassed too. There are always good and bad students. At my old age I don't care at all. 1 would rather go back to Hong Kong and work as a martial arts choreographer for movies. Enjoy the peacefulness. You should come with me to Hong Kong. Be my assistant director. It's much better than here. Besides, 1 don't recognise Dingson as my student. Master. This is no time for personal grudges. What? Personal grudges? If I wanted revenge those people would be useless. 1 can take down the entire gym myself. What are you doing? I won't let you go. 1 don't care. 1 must go back to Hong Kong. Master, 1 beg you. You need to help them now. I won't. I'm just not gonna. 1 must make you go. - What will you do if 1 don't go? - Master! I'm telling you that I'm going back to Hong Kong. You can't go back to Hong Kong! - Are you going to let go? - I won't let go. How dare you. Master, you are so cruel. I'm not cruel. 1 am heartbroken. He used me to get money. - Let go. - I won't let go. I won't let go no matter what you say. What a joke. No one can stop me. Master, you are so selfish. No matter how good your Kung Fu is it means nothing. Good. Leave. I'll go. I won't let us Chinese be bullied by westerners. Leave! I'll never go to Hong Kong to visit you. I'll never go to Hong Kong to be your martial arts assistant. What do you want? Old man Wan. You can't get to Huaqi Martial Arts Gym that easily. 1 didn't want to go there before. But now 1 wonder how difficult it'd be for me to get there. Cut the crap. My boss is pissed off. 1 need to make you pay. Make me pay? Great. 1 hate owing debt to anyone. I need to teach you a lesson. Go. Where's Mr Ding? Where did he go? He went to play mahjong. You can talk to me instead. You? Who do you think you are? OK. Master. Master. No. Leave. Master. Master. Master. Thank you for coming here to save me. You got up just in time, after the fighting is over. Master, 1 was wrong. I'm to blame. - Give him two more punches, Bill. - Master? You didn't hear him? He said he's to blame. Please forgive me, Master. I'll be a good person. I'm not here to save you today. Bill's right. Chinese shouldn't be bullied by westerners. Laura, after I'm gone you should take good care of Bill. - 1T will. - So 1 can't sneak around anymore. Don't tell anyone what happened. About you saving Master Ding? Everyone knows. - Not that. - Then what? About the fat lady. Master! Master. Master, 1 almost missed seeing you off again. Ran out of petrol halfway again? No. You're flying to Hong Kong alone. There's no one to look after you. You're gonna sit on the plane for more than ten hours. Please take care of yourself. I can take care of myself. Someone with a temper like mine would cause trouble for anyone taking care of me. Master! 1 want to come with you! Master! 1 want to go to Hong Kong too!
