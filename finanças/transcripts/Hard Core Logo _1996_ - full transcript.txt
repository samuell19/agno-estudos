Hard Core Logo (1996) The director is Bruce McDonald. The film is Hard Core Logo. Hey, Joe, what does the name Hard Core Logo mean? Logo's a Greek word. It means "similar." A sign. The punk rock Hard Core Logo... means direct action, means question authority, means anarchy. You don't like the world you're livin'in, you don't like the answers you're gettin'. It's like, "Fuck you." And that's exactly what we were all about. Fuck you. Anything else, Bruce, that we need to cover, to finish? - How do ya mean by... - Joe, what do ya... How do ya... What do you mean by Hard Core? Move or fuckin' die. If I want your cigarette, I will come and get it. I will take it from you. But if you were smart, you'll just give it to me. Because that way, it avoids confrontation. A little while ago, Bucky Haight got shot on his farm in the Prairies. Nobody's sure if it was a Chapman-Lennon thing... or some kind of stalking thing. What we do know is he was shot, and both his legs were amputated. - Both? - Both of 'em were. - I just heard it was one leg. - I just got the call. - Both of 'em were amputated. - I think it was one. - I just... Johnny. - Okay, okay, sorry. Both... Both of 'em... were cut off just above the fuckin'... just below the knee. It's a stump, anyway. That's what I heard. And, uh... So, this benefit concert's for him. Fuckin' Chapman shoots Lennon, right? Rock and roll assassination. Cobain... rock and roll suicide. Fuckin' Marvin Gaye. The guy's old man shoots him in the head. That's fuckin' nice. Do you know what I mean? Bucky Haight. That motherfucker was a fuckin' huge influence. I love that guy. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here. You know what I'm sayin'? That motherfucker was fuckin' robbed, and that's what pisses me off. It's payback time. I owe him. This is for him. So what have you been doing for five years, Joe? Whatever I want. I don't know. Fuckin' around. I get by. Play a little fuckin' acoustic gig once in a while. I'm Joe Dick. People come and see that. This is different. The whole band's together. It's not just the Joe Dick Show. This is a band. This is a gang. How does, uh, Pipe contribute to this gang? When he's not a fuckin' freak of nature, he's-he's bright and he's really good at what he does. He's a tough little fuck on his own merit, you know. If there was ever a problem, Pipe would be in there in a second, and he's nuts. Uh, so tell me about the last tour. I know you had some problems with, uh, Oxenberger. He's a gang member. He had some problems. He had, like, a breakdown, and he's fine now. He's still Johnny to us. Always will be, you know? If people have problems you don't abandon them, unless you're a fucker. So Joe, when was the last time you saw Billy Tallent? He got on a plane to somewhere being a big shot, so I haven't seen him for a while. But, you know, I miss him. He'll be back. Always is. When he says he's gonna be somewhere, he's there. He may not enjoy it. He'll bitch, but he'll be there. What are you asking me? I grew up with Hard Core Logo. I have all their albums. I just totally love them. They're amazing. You know what I mean? They're not just people who are talking about stuff. They're people who are... who are making it happen, who are doing it. Bucky Haight was a really good friend of mine. When someone shoots your friend, you gotta do something about it. You know, what Hard Core Logo are doing is a really cool thing. When Joe Dick contacted me about a benefit... for his friend Bucky Haight, I thought it was an excellent way to raise awareness about this issue for younger people. Joe called me up and said... he had some record company money to film a reunion show at the Commodore. He made me an offer I couldn't refuse. And, uh, I said, "I'll be there." You better leave me alone You better leave me alone You better leave me alone Skanky stupid girls Skanky stupid girls Castrate me Skanky stupid girls How are you doin'? How's it goin'? Did you just get off the plane? Art. Bucky Haight has been shot. Luckily, he's alive. But countless others are dead because our government... still allows guns to be purchased in this country. Make guns illegal! And now, breaking five years of silence, Vancouver's favorite bad boys of punk, Hard Core Logo! You people, you're the fuckin' coolest! You see, I was just lying there, 'cause I saw you cut your fuckin' ponytails, you stupid fuckin' cunts. That wasn't very nice. You'd think there was a fuckin' punk rock revival on. You don't know shit from good chocolate, babies. I'll fuck you when I say I'm ready Who the hell you think you are Rude to the waiter 'cause he looks like me Who the hell you think you are Tip the valet to get your Rolls Who the hell you think you are Takin' that hooker to the side of the road Who the hell you think you are Who the hell you think you are Who the hell you think you are Pour yourself a glass of port Pour yourself another port Call your wife a fuckin' bitch just because you're stinkin' rich Get back home at a quarter to ten Who the hell you think you are Your wife and kids are all in bed Who the hell you think you are Pour yourself another port Who the hell you think you are Pour yourself another port Who the hell you think you are Who the hell you think you are Who the hell you think you are Pour yourself a glass of port Pour yourself another port Call your wife a fuckin' bitch just because you're stinkin' rich Guitar! Not bad for four guys who haven't played together in a while. - Surprised? - Yeah, I think we won. - We won too. - We won. Jenifur. How serious is this? Jenifur? It's really fuckin' serious. It's a big contract. I filled in for, um... What's his name? The guitar guy. - Earl. - Earl, right, on the Lollapalooza dates. And, um, I guess now he's out for good. So, Jenifur... Jenifur... Is it a done deal? It's not done completely. Not yet. I'm just waiting for some papers. Waiting for papers, green card, and then I'm gone. - You get paid. - Yeah, I'm makin' money for the first fuckin' time. It's much different than Joe and the boys. Joe seemed pretty happy you were here. He seemed a little worried you weren't even gonna show up. Well, you know, he's a bitch. You, you, you, you Who the hell you think you are You, you, you, you Who the hell you think you are That was hotter than shit, man. Hey, have a drink, man. We kicked supreme ass! Billy, that was fuckin' awesome, man. That was so great. - I'm Danny. This is Pete. - I'm Pete. - The Flash Bastards. We opened up for you. - Yeah, I was watching. - You did great. - That was so awesome, man. - You guys are the shit, man. - Hey, you're in Jenifur now, eh? - Uh, yeah, yeah. - That's cool. - What happened to that Earl guy? - He got sick. I don't know what happened. - What the fuck? - Shut up! He's mine. I'm going to take him now. - Joseph. - Fags. He called us fags, man. Hello? Thank you. I just wanted to let you all know that tonight, we raised just over $20,000. Bucky Haight! Bucky Haight! Okay, well, thanks again. Party. Five cities. It's fuckin' easy. Calgary, Regina, Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Edmonton. Okay, I'll go. I'll go, go, go, go if... Slow down, freak. Slow down. No staying in the vans, you book hotels, and we don't stay at any band houses. Okay, I lost you after "I'll go." That's all. That's what I liked. And I don't wanna have to baby-sit you. - I've been both a mother and a father to you. - Shut up. - Fuck off. - That's not buddies. That's not buddies. I got something for ya. Just so you know I'm thinking about you. It's a picture that I got when I saw it. And it's of you and I liked it. Put it in a frame and dust it off, if I can fuckin' find it. Oh! Got it. Put batteries in it. - That's not buddies. - It's funny, though. - To me, it's funny. - When I get back I'm done, right? - Yeah. - No, say it. Mean it. - Say it. - Okay. "Say it, mean it." - "Mean it, say it." - Say it. - "When I get back, I'm done." - "When I get back, I'm done." - That didn't make any fuckin' sense. - So? You asked me to say it, I did it. Anything else you'd like from me? What are we doing today? Hey! Where did Billy go? Where's Billy? Billy's gone. Uh-oh. Where's Billy? Billy... Man, you scare the shit out of me when you time-travel like that. It's good to see you back. You scared me. - I'm right here! - You don't even care when I'm gone. When you're gone, I look for you. I make an effort. I'm gone. Wow, he's gone. He doesn't even look. That's not buddies. That's not a fun game. You're still a contrary motherfucker. It'll be fun. Oh, my goodness. My life is just so complex. They can ride that whole punk nostalgia thing as long as they want. It'll be a piece of cake to book the tour. And with Billy playing guitar for Jenifur, that's gonna pull in some more people as well. Not to take anything away from Joe and the other guys. They're good guys. Say they make six Gs, and they take my 15%, the van, the food, gas, hotel, four guys, 3,000 miles, five nights. At this point, you do it for love, you know? John John, it's Joe. We got an advance from Mulligan, Billy's in. So pack your bags. It looks like we got ourselves a convoy, you copy? I lined up a van. I got a great fuckin' deal. That film crew's coming with us. They're making a movie about us. So get a note from Celine, get a note from your doctor, whoever, man. Don't blow this. 6.00 a.m. 6.00 a.m. Be there. November, 5:00 a.m. Why the hell are two grown men still calling themselves Joe Dick and Billy Tallent? When they gave themselves those names, they were 16, 17. The question is, when do they stop using them? Forty? Fifty? Sixty? You wonder if they remember their real selves... Joe Mulgrew, Bill Boisy. Then there's Pipe. Can't even remember his real name. I used to want a punk handle too. I just couldn't find one that fit. It was always John. John. John Oxenberger. John, John, John, the bass player. John from Hard Core Logo. Maybe I never had a real self to throw away like those guys. After a certain age, it's hard to, uh, make friends. And I've known Joe since I was 13. And, uh... I love him more than anybody I've met since. Pipe's a freak of nature. And John, well, there's his whole condition. - Hard Core Logo. - Yeah, Hard Core Logo. Which way you goin; Billy - You think we should wake him up? - No. - What do you think? - No. Look at this. I got it off the board at the Commodore. - It totally rocks. - How much did it cost? It takes money to make money, John. - It's a spur of the moment thing. - Yeah. - Boom! - You did the drawing? Yeah. It looks like a bootleg. - Fuck you it does. - No, it looks like a bootleg. Look at the... It looks like a bootleg. - It does. - Yeah. Fuck you. It's perfect. - It looks like a bootleg. - Yeah, it does. It looks like a bootleg. - You wanna know why? - Why? Because it's a bootleg. Well, at the peak of our fame, we had it all together. We'd sell a million t-shirts a night. We managed ourselves. We had great hotel rooms. We had everything. Tons of booze on the Ryder, a driver. You know, it was... It was working for us. That was before Ed Festus showed up and fucked it all up. Joe brought in Ed Festus to manage us. Good contacts there, talk of a, uh, a major label signing us. We were a band for 12 years. We were simply a band for 12 years. And then we stopped being one. That's it. And money caused a lot of tension. Well, it was like, we were playing New York City. It's our last night, right? Last gig, we're playing New York. Joe always had a thing for the grand gesture. President of Sire Records is sittin' there, right in front of the stage. We're halfway through "Something's Gonna Die." Joe jumps up on the table, drops his fuckin' pants... It's personal. You had to be there. And then pisses into Seymour Stein's gin and tonic... and then yells into the mike, "Hey, see if you can sell that, you corporate weasel!" I mean, talk about game over, you know what I mean? He'd just fuck it up because he didn't want that next level. He didn't wanna step up. There's two different ways to look at it. Billy just wants the models and limousines, and I'm happy with the hookers and taxi cabs. Addiction, um, is a gamble, and the gamble is that you're losing most of the time. And losing is a place that you're most happy. For Joe, I think that's... So what, are you playing us off against each other? So that would make you kind of a cunt, wouldn't it? It's the best thing we've done yet, negative boy. You people, you're the fuckin' coolest. You see, I was just lying there, 'cause I saw you cut your... Fuck! Hey, are we gonna stop and eat soon? You fuckin' stopped! You stopped at fuckin' Herbies! Turn the fuck around right now, John. - I'm fuckin' serious. - You snooze, you lose. Hey, did I or did I not say, "When we go to Herbies, wake me up"? - No! - Fuck that! You guys know I love Herbies. If you don't fuckin' pull this van over and turn around, I'm gonna... I'm gonna fuckin' piss right here. - You snooze, you lose. - I'm gonna piss. - Piss in a bottle, you little piglet. - Pull over, John. - Nope. Nope. I'm gonna piss right here. - John, pull over. - Keep driving. - I'm gonna piss right here! It's gonna blow! It's gonna blow, baby! Okay, we'll stop. Pull over, Johnny. Pull it over. That's buddies. Now, sit down, fucking cunt. My leg! John, stop the fucking van! Oh, fuck! Oh! - Hey, Pipe, you okay? - Ah, fuck. I fuckin' pissed myself. All I wanted was a fuckin' burger. Here, baby. Here's for fuckin' pissin' yourself. Nice van, Joe. Fuckin' mook. Covered a hole with a piece of fuckin' carpet. Dink. Fuck that shit! I'm-I'm okay. Yeah. Yeah. - I miss you. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Yeah, okay, bye. You-You know I do. Yeah, I love you, okay? Okay, bye. Hey, do you have a girlfriend, Bruce? - Yeah. Okay, cut. - You should call her. The tour is gonna be fuckin' fantastic, man. I mean, it's ripping. Our tunes are ripping. Our set is as solid as a rock. As long as we can keep... the fuckin' mentals fuckin' together, then everything's gonna be great. This time it's a lot different, because I think Joe's not such a dick anymore. He's still spittin' in my face all the time. I'm gettin' used to that spit thing, you know. I think we're gonna go all the way with it this time, unless he dies in a bizarre gardening accident or something like that. You know, I see, like, if we can get successful, it's, like, "L-L, "man... limos and Lear jets. That's what I want... limos and Lear jets. I think Joe's a little let down... that Billy's leaving. 'Cause, you know, Billy's got bigger and better things to do, right? I don't know. He's a good shit. He's got his shit together. Because obviously, he's got something going on after this. I don't have fuck all. I'd say keep the whole thing together really, basically. I mean, I'm a little bit of an asshole sometimes, because they're all pricks. That's the way it works, though. Keeps each other on our toes. Pipe, load in. Billy, tune the strings. John, you draw up a set list. - And what are you gonna do? - Manage. The West is the best! I don't need anyone Don't need no mom or dad Don't need no pretty face Don't need no human race I got some news for you Don't even need you too I got my damn machine Got my electronic dream Sonic reducer ain't no loser Sonic reducer ain't no loser November 6, 3:00 a.m. The time when most people die. Calgary's the same as ever. Big, friendly, smiling, beef-eating faces. Good faces here. Better than L.A. with its "Go for it" stoner faces, or Toronto with its smug little rat-race faces, or Montreal with its separatist chain-smoker faces. I always felt welcome here. They are nonjudgmental faces. They do what they're told. Things will be different then The sun will rise from here Then I'll be ten feet tall And you'll be nothing at all I got my damn machine Got my electronic dream Sonic reducer ain't no loser Sonic reducer ain't no loser Sonic reducer ain't no loser Sonic reducer Sonic reducer Sonic reducer Yeah. So how did the whole thing with Jenifur come about? When I first got down to L.A., I was jamming with Trevor. You know him. - Yeah. - And then Earl got sick, and I filled in on a couple dates. So officially, you're part of the band... - No, not yet. - Or you're just a hired hand? Uh... - Um... - What are we talking about here? - Are you recording with their next record too? - What are we talking about here? - Hey, I don't know. - Ask some more Hard Core Logo questions. Okay. Joe Dick, you once said the music industry was the stupidest, sleaziest, most boring business in the entire world. - Still feel that way? - Yes, I do. The music industry, not the music. Rock and roll is a fuckin' sales tool. It sells beer, swimmin' pools and movie stars. So, uh, I read an article... where Ed Festus calls you one of the top five thrash guitarists of all time. Ed Festus has Bill Tallent in his hip pocket. - Does that bug you? - Mmm. Mm-hmm. In fact, I hate it. Could you change the subject, please? Ed Festus said you two... fought like some tanked-up white trash married couple in a trailer park. Well, some of that's true. But that's what makes our music and our art great. - All right. - I suffer for his art. That's what keeps you honest. So, Mr. Dick, does Hard Core Logo have a future? Mm-hmm. Yes, it does, Tiffany. - Could you do me just one favor? - Sure. Can you fuck off? You're good with people. Fantastic. Chicks dig it. - You love it. - I think that went well. It felt good. So how are you gettin' to and from your rehearsal spot? - Uh, limo. - Limo? No way! Are you serious? What's the rehearsal place like? I bet ya it's plush. - Totally. Yeah? - Big. - Yeah, and downstairs the Chili Peppers. - No fuckin' way! You rock star motherfucker. I bet you soon it's gonna be like, "Pipe, I can't talk. My accountant's on the line." "I got this babe in a bikini cleaning my pool, and I can't make it to the phone now." Or, "I gotta meet Courtney Love for dinner," or something like that. So what do you think about Courtney Love and a little bit of love? Sorry, Kurt. Sorry, wherever you are. Anyway, if your drummer ever loses his penis, you know who to call, right, baby? Yeah! Ooh. Love you, man. I'm tired of waking up tired Waking up tired Waking up tired I'm tired of waking up tired Waking up tired Yeah, waking up tired I'm tired of waking up tired Um, Touch of Evil. La Dolce Vita. - Alphaville. - Uh, Lolita. Alphaville ends in an "E." Uh, I've got one for you, buddy. Eraserhead. Uh, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid. Unless they're from Seattle. Dead Ringers. Um... Spinal Tap. Spinal Tap. - Um... - Parenthood. The category's cool movies, - Not dumb-ass movies, Alex Trebek. - Retardo. Good one, Bruce. - So, you got one? - Um, "P." The Passenger. - It starts with a "T, "not a "P." - Passenger. The Passenger. What's the difference, anal man? - Okay, I'll let that one go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You're welcome. - Thank you. - Rosemary's Baby. - Oh, that's a fucker. Uh, "Y." Yentl. Youngblood. - Um, Young and the Restless. - That's a soap. Stop it. Fuck, man, I can't think. - You okay for driving? - I'm good. - Are you okay for driving? - I'm good! - Young At Heart. - What's that? Uh, it's Doris Day and Frank Sinatra. He's a lounge singer. He's drunk and he's depressed. He marries Doris because he's in love with her. But then he feels he doesn't deserve her love, so he smashes his car up. - I think I saw it. Does he die? - Of course he... No, no, he doesn't. He marries Doris, and they live happily ever after and it's beautiful. Fantastic. November 6. It's Gary Cooper time. High noon. Had my flying dream again last night. I'm free riding the thermals over a rocky beach and whoosh, all the air gets sucked out of the sky by some god with a straw. And I fall, watching the rocks grow larger below rushing up to meet my face. And I know if I hit them, I'll never wake up. I know I'm going to feel my teeth breaking into my mouth, and my skull shattering and my brain splashing... like wet clay into the tidal pools. As I fall, I know this is no benign passing... from one world to a better one, but a jolt of unimaginable and pointless pain... before a total and finial negation and erasure of all that I am. So I figure I'd better wake up. All told, a shitty night's sleep. Joe hasn't slept in something like 32 hours. Probably scored some blow. You'd think he was hauling a cross or something. Hey, John, what's that writing shit? - Hey? - Nothing. Road stories. Bullshit. Freak. I write to try and keep my head clear. It's good, and sometimes... I'm afraid I'll forget things. What would happen if you forgot things? Then I would be lost, and no one could find me. Well, we've been to London and we've been to L.A. Spain, New Zealand and the U.S.A. Europe, Japan and Pago Pago Canada, Siam, Oz and Kamoto The kids all come from miles around The party gets started when the sun goes down And Holiday Inn's the only home I know I know, I know, I know Rock and roll's alive 'cause we got the power, baby Cruising down the highway at 500 miles an hour, baby We got a fuel-injected tour bus Man, it really flies With a videotape deck inside Let's go, rock and roll Everybody, come on Let's go, rock and roll Everybody come on down Touring, touring is never boring Touring, touring is never boring Touring, touring is never boring Touring, touring Oh, baby Touring Especially with your favorite girl Touring, touring all around the world Can you back up a bit? I can't focus on you so close. - Sorry, sorry. Here? - Wait. Oh, it's Celine. I keep her here so that I can see her in the morning and the night. - That's handy. Pretty woman. - Yeah. Yeah, I saw you looking at her at the beach. What else you got in there? - John? - Yeah. I, uh... Are you okay? I can't find my prescription. - Your pres... Your pills? - Yeah. I can't come to the phone right now. I'm eating corn chips and masturbating. Please leave a message. Billy boy, Ed Festus here. Listen, bad news, buddy. Earl's out of rehab and he's raring to go. Looks like he's in and you're out. Should've stayed in L.A., man. What can I say? That's life in the big shitty. Love to Joe. Later. There's nobody fuckin' out there. Like, 20 people nobody or nobody nobody? - Empty! - I don't fuckin' care. I'm not going on until there's at least 20 people in this club. - Isn't this the only club? - What did I just say? I'm not going on until there's at least 20 people in this club. Are you all right, Bill? Bill, are you all right? - Did someone die? - Where's the fucking promoter? He's gonna lose money. - I th-th-think the owner's... - What the fuck do you care about money? What's the fucking problem? - Can you keep that off me? - What the fuck is that? Serenity, man. Serenity. Has any of you... Have you seen my pills? N-N-N-N-No, I haven't seen your p-p-p-p-pills. I'm sorry. I haven't seen your pills. Yeah I got my foot in the gutter and I know I'll make a mess out of you Yeah I got my foot in the gutter and I'm gonna make a mess out of you Yeah I got my foot in the gutter I'll make a mess out of you Let's hear it for Mr. Billy Tallent, the heart and soul of the Hard Core Logos. Don't spray, Dad. I can't hear you. Your mouth's full of shit! Yeah, come on up here, tough... You wanna mess with me, you're gonna have to go through my right-hand man, Mr. Billy Tallent. Thank you, William. I got a bullet in my pocket like I'm bona fide I'm saving it up For the right occasion I like the night It feels pretty good, all right All I gotta do is get me a gun Stick it in the barrel Step outside There'd be no peace There'd be no fight Someone's gonna die tonight Mary! How you doing? - Oh, you know, I'm still here. I'm living my life. - Uh-huh. I don't think you've met my husband, have you? Evan, this is Joe Dick. - How are you? - Pleasure to meet you. And this is our daughter. Hi, sweetie. Hi, sweetie. What's your name? Uh, Billy. She's not usually so shy. She looks scared. Doesn't like the monster. - Anyway, you guys sound great. Better than ever. - Seriously? - Oh, come on. It-It-It... It was crazy. - Whoa. - Seriously? - Yeah. - Then she gets a shirt. You want a t-shirt? - Hey! - It's my band. Use that voice. - Say "thank you." - The best rock and roll band in North America. - Say "thank you, "Billy. - Nice meeting you. We'll see you. All right. - Hey, thanks, Joey. - Mary. - Hey! Come on. Give me a hug. Hey, how'd you get this... this sexy scar on your hand? Well, I, uh, fell on a case of empties. Well, hello, Mr. Sandwich Man. - Hello, little girl. - Hello. Are you gonna eat me, little girl? - I don't know. - Are you gonna eat me, Pipefitter? Oh, yes, my friend. I am going to eat you. Billy, save me! Aah! No, I'm Billy. Your name is Billy? Anyway, Joe pops Billy on the side of the head when he's not looking, and Billy flushes Joe's stash down the toilet. And then, they just started wailing on each other. We didn't even make the stage. Major disaster all the way around. - They were fighting over movies? - No. That was just how they dealt with the real issue, which was Joe fucking Billy up the ass the night before. What? Probably out of spite. I wasn't there. Maybe it was a bet or a competition they had, or maybe they were trashed... and Joe nailed Billy when he passed out. Anyways, it's vague. What-What's your name? I'm Mary. Every town, man. There they are. Let's see. Joanna and Tracy. Prairie girls, born and bred. Finished high school together, hightailed it right here to the big smoke. And they share a basement apartment with eight cats. Joanna did a year at Wascana College. Got bored, smoked dope. Now she works the Orange Julius stand at the fucking Northgate Mall. That's okay, 'cause she's got her eye on that cute guy who works at Le Chateau. But she's worried that her friends will think that he's a homosexual. Tracy there, with the Karla Homolka hairdo, works right here. Tonight's her night off. But that's cool too, 'cause all her friends are right here. See the old guy in the hat? That's Virgil King. He used to work his daddy's farm. Forty years of sweatin' shit. The recession hit. Kids left, he started drinking, his wife left, lost the whole deal. Found God, lost God, kept drinking. Now he just... waits. Anyway, this Jenifur thing... I've got no problem with you going down there. You record and tour. The rest of the year you spend with us. Jenifur's your side gig. You can do whatever the fuck you want. That's our policy. Has been, always will be. - Did you ever sleep with Mary? - What? - Did you ever sleep with Mary? - No. I fucked her in the back of the van, though. Fantastic. Five, six years ago, last tour? Way longer than that. Um, are you guys in a band? Yes, we are. Snow Axe. I'm Pipe Feltcher, and this here is John. - And you are? - Good looking. - Working. - Bonus. - No, no, no, no. - Turn that off. Where are you going, Billy? Uh, bank machine to get some money, pay the hotel bill. What's wrong? Uh, Joe, fuck-head that he is, partied with Thelma and Louise, and they fucked off with our cash. - So you don't have any money? - No. You got any money? - No. - You got a smoke? Thanks, man. Welcome to the old days. Fuck. Closed. I don't fucking believe this. - Joe, what the fuck is this? - It wasn't fucking closed last week when Mulligan booked it. So shut your fuckin' mouth. Looks like their license was revoked. Fantastic. What are you gonna do now, Joe, manage? Do yourself a favor, Billy, and fuck off. So, uh, what do we do, uh, now? Last night I sold fuckin' 20 t-shirts and made 100 bucks. And then you fuckin' lost it, so shut up! Look, Pipe Feltcher, I've told you five times that I'm fuckin' sorry. So you shut the fuck up! Um, I tell you what. I got a proposal for you. You take all the money I got, and then the next fuckin' place we stop by, you can just give it all away. You cheap fuck. You must have some money, 'cause you've been hogging down the deli trays and you can't be spending your per diems on food. Oh, so I suppose you want your per diems back now, Mr. So and So. - Fuck, you're an idiot. - Well, you're a kook. - No, you're a fuckin' idiot. - And you're a kook. - You gave him your per diems. - You gave him your per diems. - No, I love it. It's cool. - What? What? Los Angeles! Billy fucking Hollywood. Billy fucking Hollywood. - Billy Hollywood. See ya, Slash. - Yeah! - See ya, Slash. Rock on. - Yeah! - More! More! More! More! We want Billy! - Rock on. - We want Billy! - Call 911. We hurt his feelings. Go nuts, Slash. Go nuts, Slash. Me and Billy decide everything about the band, - Oh, fuck. - About the way this thing's shot, everything. - We decide fuckin' everything. - Yeah, we're just the roadies. That's basically it and everything you do. See, we have positions we call "the band." - Number one, number two. - We gotta unpluck his underwear for him. Which is basically the same thing, and then three. - Four's cool, but three's fuckin'... - Five is Zeak Street. - He doesn't wear any underwear. I forgot. - If we're makin'... If we're makin' movies, Feltcher would be an extra, put it that way. - Ho number one after that. - There is no such thing as that for you. There's only one number one... always will be, always have... me. But number two, they kind of coexist, so there's no big deal. Anger only works for so long. You can only be angry for so long, and then you get, uh... It-It turns in on yourself, and you're a bitter man. You become a bitter man, and that's no place to go. - You know what I mean? - I think so. - Yeah? - I think so. You need people around you to tell you where you are. Well, 'cause people buy the shtick, right? You're angry, everybody gets angry. It looks like it's about the music, but people buy into the anger of it rather than, you know... I have fun doing it. The band has fun doing it. But we're not all just, like, angry... Joe's angry, but I'm not as angry as I used to be. I don't care to be. You're not jealous at all of Billy's, uh... A little. Quite honestly, a little. But I'm jealous that he's playing with somebody else. I'm not jealous of the money trip or the fuckin' fame. - So, uh... - That's not what it's about. So what are you gonna do when you're 45? Well, it depends on how far my alcoholism goes. If I stop drinking and my liver's not a colostomy bag to match my shoes, then I'll probably be okay. I've got it together now. This fuck... This gig at the Commodore will be a great gig. Still be playing in a rock and roll band when you're 45? I'll still be writing songs, you know. And if Billy's into it... and if John and Piper are around, I'll be doing it. And if they're interested, they'll be doing it with me. And if not, we'll see what happens. S-Sometimes, when you-you look in the mirror, you-you wonder... what it would be like if I were honest... every moment for the rest of my life. Save it for your group sessions, John. N-N-No, Joe. Let's be honest. Y-Y-You'd be nowhere without Billy. You're just too much of a coward to admit it. Profound words from Ernest fucking Hemingway. A-A-And Billy, if you were honest with yourself, you'd admit that the Jenifur gig has been canceled. - John, shut the fuck up! - What? - A-A-And Pipe? - What? What's this about Jenifur, Bill? - This is just a last tango before a lifetime spent... - Bill? As a garbageman. Oh. You know what you are? Oh. You know what you are? You're a schizo, man. You're on a holiday from fucking lithium. You belong in a fucking straight jacket. What's this about Jenifur, Bill? What's this about Jenifur, Bill? Hey! Stop that fuckin' shit! Johnny! You don't know shit from good chocolate, babies. Kick the fuck back! Okay, let's get a few things in the open. Pipe, the hotel guy in Regina called. You shit on the fuckin' pillow, wiped your ass with the fuckin' bedspread. Hey, you know, that's uncool. I don't get that. What the fuck is that? - Didn't have no toilet paper, man. - No, that's nuts. Johnny? Your fuckin' writing is nuts. You're not taking your medicine. You're fuckin' fueling something dangerous. - What do you know about danger? Danger, Will Robinson. - Johnny, I'm trying to help you. - Danger, Will Robinson. Danger, Will Robinson. - Johnny, I'm trying to help you. - I'm trying to help you! - You gotta relax! We got three days left, and you gotta chill. I'm your friend and you gotta chill. You must listen to me. Hey, what about Billy? Doesn't he get a little spanking too? That's true, that's true. Bill, I guess we can can the rock star shit. - What are you gonna do? - No! I'm just saying we can can the rock star shit. - Fuck-up. - That's all. Thanks. You're a major fuck-up! You fucked up last night, got our money ripped off! You fucked up four years ago! You go out of your fucking way to fuck me! Is that honest enough for you, Mr. Write It In His Journal? - And fuck you too! - Oh, fuck you, Mr. Rock Star No More. No more rock star. - Fuck you. - Well, where do we go now? Saskadelphia. Saskatoon. Whatever. - We got two nights to kill. - I'm not stayin' in the van. Hey, why don't we stop by Bucky's place, man? - The motherfucker's laid up. We can't. - We'll just phone him. - He doesn't have a phone. Let's go. - Then we'll stop in. A little hero worship from the great fucking Joe Dick. Do him a world of good, huh? Don't you think? - Yes. Yeah. - Don't you think? Don't you think? Yeah. Who the hell you think you are You, you, you, you Who the hell you think you are You, you, you, you Who the hell you think you are You, you, you, you Who the hell you think you are Thank you. This next one's for Bucky Haight. Man's got no legs because some fuckin' psycho with a fuckin' shotgun... hunted him down like an animal and blew his fuckin' legs off. Yeah! Um... The first time I met the Bucky Haight... was in the Dick's kitchen. Um, he was singing the smartest songs I ever heard. And Joe just idolized him. I think he's a dink. I always tried to get Joe away from him musically. I taught Joe, you know, your Townshend, you know, whatever. Just the classics. And the only music that, uh, influenced Joe Dick... was, uh, Bucky Haight. To me, anyway, he's like... he's like a classic... like a member of the Rolling Stones almost. A lot of people really haven't heard of Bucky. I know. See? That's what I mean. It's like, the guys who get famous... talk about people who got them on the road, and those people are nothing. Well, like, you know, will a big rock star... cut their inspirer a check? No, I don't think so. They'll just talk about him. It doesn't pay the fuckin' bills though, does it? Bucky! Good morning. Dick Joe, Bucky's still got... Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Fuckin' Chapman shoots Lennon, right? Rock and roll assassination. Cobain... rock and roll suicide. Fuckin' Marvin Gaye. The guy's old man shoots him in the head. That's fuckin' nice. Do you know what I mean? Bucky Haight. That motherfucker was a fuckin' huge influence. I love that guy. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here. You know what I'm saying? That motherfucker was fuckin' robbed, and that's what pisses me off. It's payback time. I owe him. This is for him. Okay? Can you shut that fucker off? So is Bucky... Is Bucky in on this too? We gotta get a fuckin' microphone in there. I'm not getting much. Okay, hold on. Bruce, look at this. Check this out. This is cool. There he is. Fucker. I kind of bullshitted you about... Bucky's legs, as you can see. But, fuck, Billy wouldn't have gone for any of this shit if I hadn't, so I locked in. - So you used the benefit money for this? - Yeah. - It bought all your fuckin' film stock. - What about the record... - Shh! - What about the fuckin' record company money? I fuckin' lied. Bucky's got his legs back. Cheer up and chill out. Anyway, time to get off the coaster. Down to Austin, recorded "Blue Tattoo." Got picked up by a big one. Small, but English independent. But I was still under contract to the label, and they sued me. The fuckers sued me, and my record was recalled. It sat around in vaults till I didn't give a fuck anymore. Last time I saw you at CBS, I was hyping two bills a day. Got so bad after you left, I started into blood transfusions. Everyone I met... sucked up to me. All my friends... dead or dying. Then I got the hepatitis, came back home. You know, Joe, you start with these riffs in your head... and something you wanna say. And you wanna spin gold, but the thing is... people don't want your sounds. They only want... They just fucking use you. Know what I'm saying, Joe? Well. Cheer up. I made half that shit up. Who wants another drink? - What's your name? - Bruce. - Do you want a drink? - I'm all right, thanks. I'm all right, thanks. Look, are you gonna sit around in my kitchen being boring, or are you gonna do something interesting? Are you a real filmmaker or are you a journalist? Some kind of hack? No, it's not funny. Shut up. I mean, there must be something interesting... that five really cool, able-bodied guys and a great filmmaker... can come up with. What do you think, Brice? Okay. It's a joint venture, so everyone gets a copy of the contract. - Two for you. - Sweet. - Two for you. - Thank you. Two for you. Two for you. Two for you too, Brice. Don't be shy. Danny, we're all in this together. Where's Naomi? Naomi! - You too, Joe. - Oh, thanks, man. That's right, John. Right on the dotted line. Adios, my friend. Good morning. This is C.B.C. Radio. Walk towards the light. Walk towards the light. The social contract of my inner self... Joe? I'm sorry. Keep going. Wish I'd found you before Joe did, the way you play. Keep it. It's yours. No sense in... it lying fallow around here. Asshole. I killed the fucking goat. Pipe, we all drank its blood. - I-I only have one... one word for this. - What? Blasphemy. Joe, it was good seeing you. - You have a good time? - Yeah, I had a riot. I live out here because I got sick of being used. I don't wanna see anybody that ever used me ever again. When I heard how you used me... - I was gonna... - Put it this way. Ever back this way, don't drop in... ever. Must be the amazing healing powers of this place, - You know, Bucky up and walking again. - Shut up. That's not buddies. Hope you don't do time for the benefit. Just fucking feeding the legend, baby. - You still fucking mad at me, Bruce? - Fuck you! Shut up, John. Whoo! Hello, Saskatoon, we're the Hard Core Logos. This next one is for the late, great king of punk, Bucky Haight, who died last night in New York City. You had no time for corruption You felt the world was an unsafe place You work towards a solution A blue tattoo A blue tattoo on the soul of love A blue tattoo In the shape of a heart A '59 Strat. - Really nice. Yes. - Yeah, really nice. - You play guitar, right? - You know, so-so. Off and on? You started out as a documentary filmmaker, right? I heard that. - Yeah. That was the good old days. - Yeah? Kind of bringing it all home. That is a classic, classic guitar. You should get up on stage with us sometime. Can I come back into this? Yeah, yeah. Cut it. Keep it rolling. Keep it rolling, Danny. Joe, is he still wired? Is he wired? If Bruce ever uses that fuckin' shit with Pipe, then that fuckin' goat Pipe is fucked. - As if Pipe's ever gonna get a bank loan anyway. - Very true. Look, I'm 35 years old next week. If I play this club one more time, I'm gonna fuckin' shoot myself. What's up with you after this tour? Do I have plans? I don't know. I'm... - What about me and you? - I thought you were gonna bring me up here and apologize. No, I was going to apologize. I was gonna say sorry... that fucking Ed Festus fucked you over again for the second time. - You were gonna do that, but you didn't. - No, I didn't. What are we gonna do? You and me? You and me? What's Pipe and John... Fuck Pipe and John. John's talkin' a line to his fucking coke. Pipe fucking pops a Pop Tart. - Pipe's fucked. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - So you want you, me, you, me. - Bingo. Okay. New deal, though. - Music, no coke. You wanna hang out with fucking coke heads... - Use your head! - Keep your fuckin' voice down. - I want the music. Music! Done. I love you. Joe Dick, singer, songwriter. Joe Dick, singer, songwriter. Billy Tallent, guitar player. Pipe Feltch... Pipeftter. Drummer. Fuck you. John... John Oxenberger, songwriter, bassist, backup vocals.

Category is Fake Canadian Bands. Okay, Faster Leonard Cohen, Die Die. Sled Dog Afterbirth. You're the king, Pipe. Joe? MacArthur Parka. Let's go to fucking Hawaii Let's go to fucking Hawaii Running from the rain Thousands on the run Making like the rich Heading for the fun This is a band house, which basically means that... touring bands stay here 'cause it's cheaper than putting 'em up at hotels. I get free room and board to look after the place and cook the odd meal. - I'm a student, so it's a pretty good deal for me. - That's great. So, Mulligan called. We got third billing, 30,000 people. It's a huge gig. - Uh, when? - Three weeks. Okay, so we do some of the new shit. What about Pipe and John? Thirty thousand fucking people. We slap them into shape. That's 60,000 pairs of ears. No, it's 30,000 pairs of ears, Mr. Fucking Accounting. Hey, you guys. Check this out, man. Hey, baby. Hey, sweetie. You gotta check this one out, man. No, no, no, this is mine! It's the John Oxenberger bible. - You have no sense of privacy. - Reverend Pipeftter is gonna do the sermon. Listen to this. Get off of my shoulder. "J-J-Joe has informed me... that m-my journal has been deemed a threat to the band. Well, fuck that. What the hell has h-h-happened to us anyway?" Anyway, listen to this. 'All week we went through these motions, just holding our breath in case someone whispers a secret... too soft to hear. Well, I held my breath long enough. I heard the secret and I realized... that I really came on this tour because I can be honest with these guys and nobody else." There's more. Wait. "I came back because when I'm at home, I have to take these pills." No shit. The guy's a looney. Oh, here's a pill. Would you fuck off. "I have to lie to everyone. I lie to Celine. I lie to myself. I lie to everyone else. I have to get up every day and tell this lie every day about being normal. And before the reunion came up, I was scared I'd wake up one day... and believe that lie for the rest of my life. Makes me wonder what lies the other guys are believing." Is that hilarious or what? You guys aren't laughing. Oh, shit. W-W-Well, this s-s-settles one thing. I-I-I never knew... i-i-if you could read or not. I'm sorry, man. Look, I'm... Oh, fuck. 911. You hurt his fucking feelings. You're so fucking stupid. You loved it. - Well, it was a little funny. - I know. No shit, eh? Would you give it a fucking break? Give that camera a fucking break. Why don't you guys all fuck off. Jesus Christ. I mean, who do you think you are anyway, Bruce? Bruce, who do you think you are? I've seen your movies. You seen his movies? What is it? Roadkill and Highway 68. Come on. Give me a break. I mean, hey, hey, look. Hey, man. Look, I'm talkin' to you. We've been through shit and we've been through hell and back, and we know what it's like, and we still survived. 'Cause we're a fucking band, aren't we? We're a fucking band, man. 'Cause we're a fucking band, aren't we? We're a fucking band, man. And you wanna know something else? I bet you we're gonna be here a lot longer than you will. And I bet you any money your videos are probably on sale at Payless for 99 cents. There you go, blow. Can we get some eggs here? This beer is so fuckin' fiat. - It's from last night. I opened it last night. - It's urine. You pissed in my beer? There you go. John's... book. Words come and go, but pictures never die. You know, it's like when you spend so much time with it, it's like it is family, so... Like that's... H.C.L.F., the Hard Core Logo family. We laugh our fucking heads off, or there's just a lot of fucking tension. And that seems to work. And that's what real life is. It's like a marriage. You get along, and fights are a drag, but they happen. It's like your brother or your sister. You like them. You love them. But you never tell 'em that. You just give 'em shit for the rest of their life. Always pick out their bad points. - That's all they do. - I marry the music. I marry the percussion and the electrical sound, so I'm kind of like the mother of the band. Certain things that fall into place at different times... where, you know, maybe it was John taking care of everybody for a while... or maybe it was Pipe. Sometimes it's Joe, and then it all sort of switches around. Someone's always falling down and other people are pickin' 'em up. - We helped him out. He's doing a lot better. - The band's a family. The guy's getting so much press, he's going to fucking L.A. In a way. Fix the bridge and it'll be perfect. So, is it true you guys faked the benefit? - What are you talking about? - A friend of mine just called from Vancouver. Said Bucky Haight was never shot. - He's saying a lot of people are really pissed off. - Like who? We just saw Bucky. He's in a wheelchair. Well, I'm just saying I heard he's not. The guy showed us his stump, Victoria. You ever see a guy's stump? The guy's like, "Come on, man. I want to show you how it feels. Touch it. Touch my stump." Disgusting! So don't tell me that Bucky Haight wasn't shot. 'Cause we were there. We touched his stump. Okay? - Okay. - Okay, now beat it. Oh! That was very clever. You're walking along the street Or you're at a party Or else you're alone and then You suddenly dig You're looking in someone's eyes You suddenly realize That this could be the start of something big You're lunching at Twenty-One That was the Hard Cores with "Who the Hell Do You Think You Are?" And we have live in the studio with us today, lead guitarist Billy Tallent. Billy, welcome to "Deadmenton." Canadian capital of rock and roll worship. Terry, glad to be here.

You find a guitar player that's committed, honest, trustworthy. How was the fucking interview, William? How was the interview, William? You, uh... So you and Billy are doing a new album as well? Why do you ask, Bruce? Do you want to do our video? Well, actually, I was just gonna ask you... how you feel about Billy leaving the band. What the fuck are you talking about?
