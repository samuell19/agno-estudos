based on the novel by Abbé Prévost Ten minutes to boarding. We still have some time. I'd like some French papers, if they have any. I have an economy ticket to Paris, but I'd like to switch to first-class. Which flight? Flight 432. That's impossible. Passengers have already boarded. I'm sure you can find a way. Please, miss. - Can you do it? - Yes, we have seats available in first-class. How much will it be? 153 250 yens. That's $425.60. Thanks a lot. With me, you'd be taking a cab. Here I am. I came just at the right time to rid you of him. Don't you love him? I liked him. He knew.. he knew how to talk to sommeliers, to bikers, to young men flirting with me... to anybody. I felt comfortable, reassured and peaceful. - Do you like that kind of man? - I do. - Do you think-- - I don't. You're not that type at all. I'm doing something crazy. - Have regrets already? - Not at all. I'll think of it tomorrow, or in a week. I always end up thinking about things. So what do we do? Any more questions for Frangois Des Grieux? In your opinion, who's really leading China: - Mao's or Lin Biao's clan? - Revolution is-- Marxist ideology. A Marxism that's as remote from Russian Marxism as it is from capitalism. What's leading the country is a revolutionary spirit that doesn't believe a transition between feudalism and communism is necessary. It is indeed determined to break into History. I think we've asked Frangois Des Grieux, who's coming back from China, all the questions we had. Shall we move on to another topic? Could we get back to more concrete issues to conclude our program? So, Albert Simon, is the bad weather going to last? Yes, showers and strong winds will continue. Showers will be interrupted by sunshine, but the wind will reach 80 miles per hour on the North coast and 70 miles per hour on the Atlantic coast. That was good. It went really well. But I have to say you seemed distracted at times. That's correct, I'm a little distracted. Okay, I have to talk to you about your expenses. That's way too much money and nothing really justifies it. Well, I just need a lot of money. All right, what we can do is send you on another mission, in Africa. - Just leave immediately and-- - No. Not Africa. Africa's too far. I thought you wanted to get out of Paris. Listen, I need money and I need to stay in Paris. All right, we can do that too. Go up to accounting, we'll give you an advance which we'll deduct from your salary progressively. - ls she a good woman? - She's more than that. She's good and bad. It's hard to explain. You're so handsome! Women must be crazy about you. No doubt. How many women have you known? I was a late bloomer. I started after high-school, when I was 18. So how many women? It's hard to say for sure. To give you an average number... per year-- I want an exact number. How many men have you been with? - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter? - It doesn't, because I'm a woman. - So it does matter. For women, what counts is how many men they've loved. That's all. That's all. Are you pouting? I don't like hearing you talk nonsense. The fact that I've loved only you is nonsense to you? I can't stand the thought that you've slept with tons of guys. Even if it's you I love? You're getting on my nerves. You're just like the others. You only care for my body. If I ever hear you're cheating on me... What would you do? I'd break up with you. Or I'd kill you. Yes, I think I'd kill you. I have no desire to cheat on you. ls that true? - What about you? - I love you. - So you'll never cheat? - I don't know. It's irrelevant. - Do you want to? - No, I don't. But women are different: they don't have to want it. That's why it's irrelevant. You have to know one thing, Manon. I love to know things. If you ever sleep with another man-- Yes? Even if it's only physical... even if you keep your soul for me... Yes? we'll be through. I couldn't love you anymore. I couldn't even touch you. That means you don't love me. No, leave me alone. Leave me alone. I hate you! Don't touch me. I don't want you to touch me. Leave me alone. No! I don't want to. You disgust me. No! No! Leave me-- stop it! Leave me alone! Leave me alone. Swear that I'm the first woman you've ever raped. Swear you'll never rape another woman. All right. Here you are! New hair? I like it. - You do? - I do. - Pretty girl. - Okay. - Please don't mind me. - I always forget. - My brother, Jean Paul. - Hi. Don't you think my little sister is pretty? Don't you think? ls love making you this sad? Do you know what Prince de Ligne used to say? "In love..." "...It is only the commencement that charms." Isn't that beautiful? Where are you going? To buy some cigarettes. He doesn't like me very much. - After what you've just said... - It's only for his good. He's got to be ready. Of course, you're contributing to his little dream. - I'm living the same dream. - No, you're not. You're living a dream, but you know it's a dream. He does not. Listen, let's talk business. I want to introduce you to somebody. His name's Simon. Does it ring a bell? Tall friendly guy. He wants to see you tomorrow night. Does that work for you? - Tomorrow night? - Yeah. All right. Good evening. Do you have a reservation? - Mr. Simon's table, please. - Right this way. I know, you were expecting her. May I? ls Manon running late? What's going on? You're a grown man, so I'll spare you any lies. You're free now. Let's have dinner. All right. It'll be easy. I'll start with lobster, then the "royal hare." What about you? I'm on a diet. I'll start with some melon, then I'll have a grilled steak. Well done. SQ? So she's got a boyfriend. You mean that... Yep. Poor child. Poor kid, really. Poor Manon. He's got a hold on her. What can you do? Well, nothing. She was looking forward to joining you. But then he-- Poor Manon. So, what's the guy like? He's... What can we do? - Set her free! -Yes, but if she loves him? Of course, she doesn't love him. It's all an illusion. She's taken by his charm. It's all an abominable mix of sensual pleasures and threats. Poor kid. Poor Manon. I wasn't a great student, but still, I went to school. So I have a logical mind. My sister loves you, but she thinks she's in love with that thug, who's doing everything he can to keep her for himself. So let's do the same. There's a lot we can do. Like what? Manon is a child. She loves everything that glitters. Everything that glitters? - Trips? - Exactly. An apartment she could arrange to her taste. - Nice outfits. - Nice outfits. And you know, I was thinking of opening a club... - Excuse me? - We'll talk about it later. Let's just talk about Manon. - Right. - We have to save her. Quick. Are you there? I had a dream. - I'm scared. - I'm here. I'm going back to sleep. Go to sleep. So you'll never leave me? Never. Does my face remind you of anything? Of many things indeed. You traitor. - I don't love you. - Perfect! Do you like dresses? This dress... was made for you. - All right, you have to go. - I'm waiting for someone else. Let's go. I'll explain. Who are you? I know you were waiting for Manon, but I'll be taking her place. It's a surprise. Indeed. So where is she? I'll tell you everything. Take the left lane. Why would I? Because we're going to my place. What for? We can do anything. The possibilities are endless. That includes sleeping together. You're absolutely charming. Absolutely charming. And I don't understand anything. Well... I've always wanted to meet you. Manon's told me so much about you, that... Did Manon put you up to this? Well, she was afraid. Afraid of what? - Afraid you'd be shocked. - Shocked? Will you please explain? - It's just that you're so romantic-- - Where is she? Manon left, so come have a drink at my place. Okay? - Are you kidding me? - Not at all. Miss, please wait! Come. Once we're up there, you'll tell me where she is and I'll call her. I told you. She left. - Just like that, by herself? - No, not by herself. Who with? Listen, Manon wants to have whatever she desires. And she asks of men that they provide for that. All you've given her was love, and that was not enough. She's on a beautiful yacht, destination the South Seas. There you have it. Here you are! How are you doing? - How was the water, honey? - Just perfect. Phone call for Miss Manon. - For me? -You called a number in Paris? A number in Paris? - She did. - Whose number? - I don't know. - Never let her call Paris. Let her do anything but that. ls that you? I've tried to reach you for the past five hours. - How are you? - I'm fine. You know what? I met a man from Iceland in Paris. Very handsome. He gave me an orange Persian cat, even more handsome than him! You're so lucky to be in Paris. So, did you see Frangois? Who? Frangois? He's cute, but not much fun. - My cat's got a better sense of humor. - Where is he? - Next to me. - Frangois is with you? No, my Persian cat is. I don't care! Where is he? He's left. I had lunch with him before he took off. - So it didn't work? - It worked perfectly well. But you know me, I was running out of things to tell him. - He's been sending me postcards. - Where from? The last one's from Stockholm. He says that Swedish girls are beautiful and that it's really cold. He's in Stockholm? On a mission? That's it. - So, take care. - You too. Bye. Excuse me-- well, I don't have time for proper excuses, but it's a serious matter and I must talk to you. Right now? Yes. Manon's going to go get her lover back. What are you talking about? My husband's her lover. Well, she's got another one. Another one? She's cheating on Simon. I would have never thought. If Bianco ever did that to me... Speaking of Bianco, if your husband loses Manon, do you think he's going to put up with Bianco? - So we have to stop Manon. - Exactly. And I'm counting on you. Listen, you have to speak to her, woman to woman. - Right now. - What about you? I've been trying to reason for too long. To her, I'm nothing but a nagging brother, always lecturing her. But you... you're charming. And she looks up to you. Listen, I understand what she's doing. She's in love. She's going to see him, but she'll be back to me. Don't ever forget that Manon is unpredictable. I never forget. I actually like that. Can you imagine a reasonable Manon? She'd be as boring as this boat. Let's not talk about her. Manon is fascinating in two circumstances: when she's around, and when she's not. Good morning, Frangois. Good morning, Christina. Did you sleep well? You're already up? Yes, I heard something. I thought it was room service. - Good morning. - Good morning. My love. Aren't you afraid? Frenchmen are always afraid women will tie them up. - No. - You're not my first Frenchman. You've asked me to correct your language mistakes, so the correct expression is "to tie someone down." - "Tie someone down." - I'll remember that. Do you have a cigarette? If my boyfriend could see me... - ls he the jealous type? - He doesn't like me smoking. My love... - What about you? - What about me? Call me "my love"... It's not forever. What does that mean? "24 hours of love." My love... What does "tack tack" mean? "Tack" means "thank you." "Tack tack" means "thanks a lot." "Tack tack tack" means "thank you very very much." Do you live with someone in Paris, or are you free? I'm as free as a bird. Your preferring is to be free? - My what? - Your preferring. The word is "preference." Do you still think of her? One day, I woke up feeling better. What day was that? I wish it were today. It is. Did you think you could get rid of me? I've been to every hotel in town. Do you have a crush on your Swedish girl? Are you taking her to Paris with you? What do you want? You're all I've been thinking of. What about you? Very much so too. Constantly. I've been imagining things. Was the girl supposed to feed your imagination? You're reckless.. Just reckless. So he dumped you? Nobody dumps me. I take care of the dumping. As you well know. You're mean. I hope you didn't slap her. She speaks French really well. Almost no accent. She is French. French, huh? So you're Francois's big love. So you came all the way here to get him back. I can understand why. He's a wonderful lover. Thanks for not coming too early. Sorry for interrupting. I am meeting with my boyfriend. It's our first anniversary. I shouldn't be late. It's a day important. We say "an important day." Thank you. I'll remember that. Thanks again and... good bye. Good bye. I wonder if she'll tell her boyfriend about you. I couldn't care less. Are you pouting? I'm here. You're here. Nothing is keeping us from being happy. Everything is. We'd have to be crazy to get back together. What were you thinking? That everything would be like before, that we'd leave here a happy couple? I was. You were? I was. Yes, I was. Yes, you were. - Good morning, my love. - So you speak French now? - I'll explain. - Happy anniversary. - Hello. - You want more money, don't you? Indeed. You were in Sweden for 12 days and you didn't bring anything back. You did nothing, you have nothing to put on the air. - Anyone can mess up a mission. - Not if you work hard. So let me tell you something: work, work hard, so you'll spend less money and earn more. - Got it? - Got it. How about my advance? All right, but it's the last time. Do you like it? I like you. - How about my dress? - I like you both. You like us together? Together and separately. - I've got something to tell you. - I'm late for my appointment. It's very important. - You want to marry me? - I do. I love you too much to marry you. I'll never leave you. Are you going out? Are you going out? I'm not. Are you staying in with me? lam. - Make your choice. - She never will. Yes, she will. It'll take five seconds. I'll count to five. One... two... three-- - Come on! Think for a second! - I don't like to. Manon came back to me and told me everything. He's right. - I've accepted to share her. - I have not. A single man will never be enough for Manon. We'll be live after 6:00pm. - What do we do about Des Grieux? -You know it's hopeless. I saw him, I talked to him, and the only solution is to let him go now. - I don't know. - Well, you'd better do it. I don't want to see him around. Des Grieux. So, are you happy about your report on Bolivia? - You're not. - Not particularly. Rightfully so. What you did was... There are no words. You took the money, you told me you were going to Bolivia, you're staying in Paris, you're putting together a fake report-- thankfully, we managed to pull the plug before it was aired, or we would have all been compromised. This time, it's over. You understand? It's the end. We end it here, with no severance pay, of course. We can be discreet about it. No need for a scandal. There's no room for discussion, ‘cause you went too far. - Give me one more chance. - Don't push it, okay? It's over, done, period. I wish I knew who told them I'd never left Paris. Mr. Frangois Des Grieux, who has a very bad temper, got on Simon's nerves, and what did Simon do? Simon picked up the phone and he told them you'd never been to Bolivia. - That's it. - The bastard. That's typical of Simon. He wants me to starve. Let's switch. We are broke, dear Jean-Paul. We are broke and penniless. And unemployed. You'll have to support us. You could unload trucks at the market. You don't like change, Frangois. - What if I punched him in the face? - You've already done that. Manon is right. That's where it all started. Simon wants me back. That's why he got you fired. No, it's only because I punched him in the face. But you did because of me. I did. - I'm happy! - Only when you get attention. And so what? I won! What about me? Come on! What shall we do? - What shall we do? - I don't know. I don't know. Frank Janis. From the oil company? Yes. Thanks. Do you love her? I do. So do I. How much do you love her? Very much. Who's that man with her? Him? No worries, he's only her brother. "My dear Frangois... I swear that I love only you. You're the only person in the world I can love the way I do. But... our financial situation-♪ "But our financial situation would make fidelity a rather idiotic virtue. Jean-Paul will inform you of my decision and of the sadness I felt because I had to leave you. I live in the hope of seeing you again, maybe tomorrow. I love you. Manon." - Are you taking me for a fool? - Listen, Frangois-- I appreciate the familiarity between us, but-- You're exaggerating. Break whatever you want at your place, but not here. - There's nothing left to break. -You didn't have much in the first place. Frangois-. - Tell me where she is! - I have no idea! - Tell me! - I swear I don't know! You still don't know? She's going to call. Let's remain friends or you'll never see her again. It's her. You whore. You whore. You whore! I understand, but I'll explain. - You're all I think about. - I never want to see you again! I never want to see you again. Ever! I'll meet you at Ungaro's at 11:00. You know, the fashion designer. It's over, Manon. It's over. You'll tell me when I see you. Come before 11:00. Ask for Stephanie. She knows. I'm begging you, darling. Come before 11:00. Answer me. If you want an answer, I'll need a question. Who are you meeting at 11:00? Nobody. Who were you calling "darling"? Somebody. My brother. I wasn't asking to meet him. I was just reminding him he had an 11:00 dental appointment. It's unbelievable: a grown man who's still afraid of going to the dentist. Plus how could I meet him at 11:00? That's when we're meeting with the fashion designer. Good morning. - Your dress is ready. - Very well. - Will you please follow me? - I'll go with you. Are you crazy? Men are not welcome at fittings. I'll leave you two. I came to say good bye. Don't speak too loud. He's right there. - He's insanely jealous. - ls he now? On top of everything, he's jealous? - So? - I'm working for us. He's very rich and money has no value to him. I suspected you wouldn't like it. But he hasn't asked anything of me. You think I'll believe that? He likes to be seen with girls, that's all. He travels a lot. We don't have to break up. Please. - I'm begging you. - You're begging me for what? I'm begging you to love me. Good morning, Mr. Janis. This is very important. - This will be fascinating. - Do you have a picture of her? She's here, trying on a dress. - Do I know her? - You do. She'll come out of here with me. Then I'll leave her and you'll just follow her. Understood. - I want the details. - All right. - And I mean, all the details. - As usual, Mr. Janis. Bye now. - ls she done? - Yes, we're done. - Are you satisfied? - Very much so. - So? - I lost her at the department store, in the stockings aisle. - Did she intentionally lose you? - I don't think so. - There were so many people! - That's what I pay you for! I know. I'm supposed to follow Miss Manon Lescaut. SQ? I need to know. There were so many people, I got her hair mixed up. Hair... that's all I could see! I mixed up her hair... - With somebody else's? - I did. How could you? Manon's hair is unique! You're such a lout! Because of you, I will never know what she does between 6:00 and 8:00. - Maybe you could ask her. - I only question a woman when I already know the truth. What? Come on... we've been working together for five years, and it's the first time I've ever failed. Go, go! What I can't stand is imagining Manon in his arms. You're jealous, and that's terrible. He's jealous. - What does that mean? - See? Jealousy is old-fashioned. Let's make love, not war. Give him a kiss. Give her a drink. Put it on my tab. That's enough. Look at them. - Come on, look at them. - Where? There. They've all been cheated on. They all have been... and they'll all continue to be. Unless they die. They've all been cheated on. So unless you live on another planet, everybody gets cheated on. That's the 20th century for you. But you.. the difference between you and them, is that you haven't been cheated on. Do you think Manon never... Whether she did or not is completely irrelevant. - No, it's crucial. - No. - No, it's crucial. - No, what's crucial... What's crucial is that you tell yourself that Janis is a cuckold because of you. Do you realize Janis gave me this club? My lifelong dream. All I have to do is pretend to be the defeated lover. You could make way more by playing the protective brother. You're like me: not a much of a hard worker. Manon, she's a girl of her time, and she likes material things. I'm a man of my time. Just be like me. - I'm a man of my time. - There you go. Manon... I've always thought she could support the two of us. Sorry, I have to make a call. Very interesting. I love being with you. We're happy together, right? Admit it, I have good ideas. Are you happy? Look, a seagull! No, that's a gull. I love you. Nice? That's right. Hi, darling. - How are you? - This is wonderful. I'm having a delightful time! Very good. How's your brother? I will. - Are you being good? - Of course, I'm a loyal man. So am I. I want you so much right now. Listen, I'm leaving for Hong Kong in a few minutes. As soon as I get back, I'll meet you there. You're all I've been thinking about. Darling... I want you so much right now. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. He'll be taken by you. You'll give him a lot of pleasure. ls this where things will happen? In these very sheets? - No. - Why not? Because sheets get changed every day here. Push it a little further, and this situation will be unbearable. - It is unbearable. -You did agree. - I didn't. - You liar. What if I had been married when we first met? To Frank, for instance. Would you have stopped loving me? If he could see us... he would die of jealousy. Let him die, then. Georges! "Waterloo! Waterloo! Waterloo! Dismal plain! Like a current bubbling up into an overfull urn In your theatre of woods, hillocks and valleys, Pale death swirled together the somber battalions Europe on one side, France on the other..." Are you listening to an alt program? No, I.. - Are you happy? - Delighted. As soon as my divorce gets finalized in Mexico, I'll marry Manon. What did you ask him to stop doing? I've been waiting for this moment a long time. - Have you been thinking of me? - I'm happy to see you. I've been thinking of you. So have I. Especially since last night. Why is that? Because I felt jealous. - Jealous? - Sure. Of whom? Who were you jealous of? Come. My love... I've been dreaming of seeing you do this. I love you. Stop it! No, stop. Be nice, Manon. You're killing me. I like it when you're docile. I love you. I love only you. I love you so much. No, stop! Stop! I love you. I love you, honey. You two don't talk very much. Of course we are. Will you have coffee here or in the living-room? As you wish. You're quite funny. Thank you. What's on your mind? - What about him? - What about him? You're not asking what's on his mind. I don't care. He's my brother. It must be incredible to be Manon's brother. It varies. How about you, honey? What's on your mind? - I am sad. - Why is that? Because you're leaving. Bye. Stop here. - Are you getting off here? - I am. You can drive on to Nice. - Then what do I do? - Then you come back. Very well, sir. ls this a new lighter? It's not mine. It doesn't work. You got a light? - Please? - Here. So how are things with him? With him, it doesn't count. Tell me. - Tell me. - Let's not talk about him. - If he could see us. - If he could hear us. How does he do it? Tell me. Come on, he's gone now. Don't talk about him. But... how does he do it? - Please tell me. -You're being silly. - You know everything. - What do I know? What do I know? You were the first for me. And after that? You were the first and the last. Poor him. - So you're deceiving him. - Of course. Stop talking about him. It's like talking about work. It's like talking about work, huh? Frangois... there's only you. There's only you. Only me what? You're the only one. I'm the only what? Shout it. Shout it. You're the only one who's ever had me. Louder. - The only one who's ever had me. - Louder! You're the only one who's ever had me. You're the only one-- - Here. - You bastard! What you did was lousy! You knew he was listening and you didn't tell me. That's rotten! It's low! You intentionally ruined everything! You're perverted! You bastard! I'm cold! Move over. - I'm freezing! - Mind the back of the boat. You're a traitor, and that's lousy! - Mind the back. - Okay! Don't pull. Do you want me to help or not? Move the rope! I'm cold. You're such a bastard! Vacation's over! - Are you coming? - No, I've had enough. My feet hurt. - Come on. - No. - You're on your own. - Very well. It hurts. I forbid you to talk to me! I'm getting tired of your lies. You're a worn-down dandy, a loser! I'm tired of your ugly mug! Why did I ever meet you? Leave me alone! You're nothing but a loser! You're a dumb-ass too. You'll get what you asked for! So I'll be faithful. - You never will. - You don't know me very well. You'll see, I'll be faithful now. You asked for it! Faithful. Faithful. I was so close! I was going to have it all! I could have asked for anything! I would have ruined him! But no! You were impatient and you destroyed everything. You ruined it all. That means you don't love me, that you never have. You've never loved me! You're nothing but a loser. A loser! A loser! Do you hear me? Loser. Come on. Turn the charm on. Leave me alone. THE END
