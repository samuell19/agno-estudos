Thank you my love. ALDO:Have you noticed? - Damn holidays! ALDO:There comes a time in life where priorities are lost. People start trading bullshit about the important things and the important things for bullshit. Brian, remember one thing: when you die it doesn't matter if you have the money, the beautiful car or if you are famous, it only counts if Aldo Baglio will become world champion of Massachusetts! ALDO:I don't know how, but at some point it happens to everyone. People start thinking only at work, in pain in the ass and the beautiful things if you forget them.

ALDO:Suddenly, what before it made you happy you don't care anymore. "Football on Thursday"? "I have no time". "Pizza with friends"? "No!" "What should we tell each other?" Going on vacation is also a problem. As a child you can't wait, when you grow up when it comes to leaving, they all get nervous. (COOKS) - Sonia, I'm devitalizing. - Excuse me, doctor. There is the engineer Lantieri who has a problem with his incisor. - At this time? - Indeed! - Tell him to come back in September? - No, I do after this. - What's up? - If he doesn't need me, I'd go. -Go, I'll manage by myself. - Thank you Doctor. Happy holiday. - Happy holiday. - Until we meet again. The holidays. Pilgrims, do you take holidays? - Unfortunately, no, I have to work. - Blessed are you! Open well. ALDO: Maybe because "leaving is a bit dying" which, however, in my opinion, it is a great bullshit! Because to me, who am frail and I'm always sick, I just need to go out two kilometers from Milan and I already feel better. Hurry up, it's already late. Pull over here, I'll walk. It is useless to go all the way around. ILARY:Mom, why can't he come? - The house is small and it's hot! It's better here.

Okay, but "this thing" we can't use it for everything. - Come on, we're on vacation. - Sure, let's justify it! He didn't do anything, poor thing! Indeed, we stop at the next motorway restaurant, so you can rob him! - Shut up, okay. - Good boy! ILARY:Mom? - What's up? MELISSA:How far away? - Eight hours and twenty minutes. If you ask me again, I ride the car and go back to Rozzano! Little girls, some music to ease the tension? ILARY:Yes! But not Massimo Ranieri! MELISSA:We are fed up with Massimo Ranieri!

Don't argue for a little money, we close and forget about it. It is a question of principle! He's right! In fact, sorry if I'm allowed. It's a question of civilization, honesty, fairness. Otherwise where do we go? Holy words! Driving license and registration document, I call the tow truck for confiscation. Confrontation, dialogue is important.

GIACOMO:No, imagine! -So, do you think about the customer? - We missed him too. Ludovico. I lack respect, he avoids me. Today, on the beach, because he said that I'm not his father? - I have a feeling you hate me. - It's normal, he's 12! At that age, with a mother like me, I'd hate everyone too!

We just write to each other, we live far away. I didn't understand if we are boy and girl. You know what? Go and figure it out! Don't put it off. One says "then I'll think about it", but then it's too late! "Life has to be bitten, 0 remorse remain. "This is mine! - "Bites, remorse" ... do you understand? - Yup. A small masterpiece of hermetic poetry. How about a drink"? Do we "break through"? Brian! CARMEN:It's my turn, shuffle and choose four dogs. Making your own tarot is bad. Ah! The secret.

I feel this iodine is good for me! There is one thing I would like to ask you, according to you ... Is "trumpeting" a possibility? Why not! - What do you mean? - Okay, let's do it. Now? - Do you prefer later? No ... - More than anything else, where? - Here, behind the dunes. - Or at home. - In my parents' bed? It makes an impression on me. - In that of mine. - I was speaking in general, it was more an idea ... - Fear, huh? - It's not fear. - Partially yes. - Come on, idiot, let's go take a bath. Brian! Come here! Brian! - You see it? - Thing? JOHN: They are playing! - Play too, participate! - Bravo, you're right! (CRUNCH) Brian! (Screams) Brian! But where?

Brian has a microchip in his collar, with the appropriate "app" is "HM!" both precisely for "appropriate", and ... And "? And "shit" doesn't happen. The satellites are not aligned. You got it in the same store of the printer? - Maybe he was kidnapped! - From who? From those of the crashed car. They are impulsive people, a wrong look and make your car explode. - But who are they? - Didn't we give him the money? - Maybe if the Marshal is kept. ALDO:But no! - 0 was the gentleman on the beach. - Which? - The client permanently scarred. - I have not scarred anyone! Check it out! "My studio is among the most prestigious in Lombardy! There was a little accident while I was working on the alveolar nerve .. - He said, "I'll kill you, you piece of shit." - What about Brian? I too, yesterday, had an argument, in town. With whom? Do you remember Rudy Contrada? I met him by chance. - Why did you fight? GIOVANNI:So ... I found it! - Where did it go? - And far away! How did it get there? JOHN: In two hundred meters, turn right. In a hundred meters, turn right. - In fifty meters, turn right. - I understand! To the right! I beg you! You make my brain melt! You say you understand, but we missed the turn! As soon as possible, reverse the direction of travel. Did you understand? - As soon as I allow the roadway. -Let's go on "ad Iibitum"! GIOVANNI:As soon as possible, reverse the direction of travel. GIACOMO: I understand! JOHN: It looks like a steamer is mooring. It's a big car, not a can. We need caution, about it. JOHN:You bought the big car, but you can't drive it! GIACOMO: The streets are small! You won't be much of a dentist, but about how you drive nothing can be said to you!

ALDO:Don't collect. Can you go faster? The trees are overtaking us. The terrain is rough and the tires are not adequate. It's an SUV, it's made on purpose, I says the word. "On Variable Surface This has only two-wheel drive. You already "busted" it for me, at least save the shock absorbers! - Do you know how much they cost? GIOVANNI:It's really true! Thing? "Big SUV, little man"! JOHN:Giacomo ... - What are you doing? "Little man" stops here. You're right, we apologize. Giovanni, apologize to the little one ... to Mr. Giacomino, a great professional and a dentist of lineage who must be respected. - Apologize. - (whispers) Sorry. - I have not heard. - Sorry. - I have not heard. - Sorry! Maybe you have to go to the otorino! Shall we proceed? It happens even to the best. Now, however, step on the pedal and get this car going! My dog is dying of starvation. Thank you. And now? - (Aldo yells) Brian! - (Giovanni yells) Brian! - (screams) Brian! - (whispers) Brian ... It's a dog, not a cat! - You call him! - (whistles and screams) Brian!

(screams) Brian! - (screams) Brian! - Incredible... Thing? He came this far to throw himself under, poor beast! Dogs don't commit suicide! He always was cheerful, happy, smiling. - You already talk about it in the past tense. - I say "was" because who knows where it is now. I saw him two hours ago scampering happily on the beach. - Keep this memory dear. - (screams) Brian! (Screams) Brian! - Brian ... - Aldo! -And he? - Which? That disjointed cluster. - They are stones! It doesn't move. - After a flight of thirty meters, this is normal. - Poor beast. - (screams) Brian! (Aldo yells) Brianino! - You really are a bastard! - Because? - Why are you raging? He suffers. - What about you, then? Thing? You scare people and these are the consequences. I have not scarred anyone! They also acquitted me on appeal! "Also on appeal ..."

Can not be done! CARMEN:Based on the water you throw away the salt. - That's not true, you have to put first ... I need the password credit card. I don't remember it. Ask dad. - Yes, but after a while ... - Your credit card password. - For what? - I need to download a video game. - Let's eat ice cream, then let's see. - I need it now. We are at the sea, forget it video games. If I said no, it's no. Come on, give me this fucking password! - What did you say? Repeat! - Give me this fucking password! What are you doing? Are you crazy? - Sorry, I was wrong, I'm going. -He's my son, I'm going. It doesn't matter, these things happen. - What do I do, am I going? - Go! But yes! Nothing happened! A couple of slaps are good for him! What are you saying? Today's kids lack authority. - Why are you making circles? - Children tear parents apart and put them in the freezer, and don't tell me it's not true and the problem is my circles with the fingers? So, we guys would be all criminals and then you come and solve everything to "blows"? So, for example, to that friend of yours there if they gave him two more slaps, would still be cleansed. - Look, dude! - Thanks Dad. You ruined everyone's evening and me the holiday, are you happy? Good boy. Fuck off! Except, let's go. Well done! What do we do now? Shall we slap her too? What's on your mind? - You wanna know? - Yes exactly. I mean two years ago. - Do you know what happens in September? - No what? The shop closes forever. Finished. Perhaps! Long last! It is from 1921 that you break our balls with the insoles! And what do I do, the laundry? Ironing? Good boy! I've been washing and ironing for twenty years! It would be enough for me to return to being a normal father and husband. Incidentally, Giovanni, every now and then it would also be nice to "fuck" Limoncello? But yes, a drop. I'm not angry, I'm sorry for him. I don't know how to help change things. They do not change now, they are just like that. Look at my father, "I can't do this do "," I can't do this "... We have a wheelchair at home, says you never know! Of course. You know how many sick days he's been on this year? 117, He is not a slacker, but he "shits down". He is afraid of making mistakes, of failing. - When he was young, he was good. - Your father? Yup! sang in the clubs. Morandi, Ranieri, that music there. One day he is noticed and invited to a special evening. Whoever wins goes to Sanremo. My father, in Sanremo! What does he do? He makes up an excuse and it doesn't work. He was afraid to sing in front to all those people. What can we do, rage? Tell him to get a move on, don't believe him? Because? He is like that and I keep it that way. The same goes for your father. After all, it's not bad. Just look at you. He did a good job. So to say, if I had to choose you another man, how would you like me? - What do you say? - One day you might get tired of me. - What do you want to tell me? -It's a game. Who would you like? - Tell me the truth, do you have another one? - Huh? I'm not stupid! You are always cheerful, it is clear that you have another. - The tarot cards also say it. - What exactly do they say? That you are keeping something important from me. - Come on, come here. - No! - Do we have to fight over osmosis too? - Do not touch me! Oh well, if they say the tarot! ALDO: Good night. I know, as I would like. - Thing? - The other man. - How would you like it? - With hair! - Be quiet, they hear us! - You can't hear it. - To the sea they told me yes! - For real? - What a shit figure! - Let's be quiet. - Will you make me the tiger man move? -Do you want me to break your arm?

More gunpowder. - It is not too much? - Never! They come from all over the islands to see this show which must be unforgettable! - Why do you care so much? - It is the most important holiday of the year. The most precious event, the end of this fucking summer! You understand? These thousands of tourists, red, skinned, with those hideous flip flops! And with the "pinocchietti"! They finally leave and for a year we don't see them anymore! Fire! (BURST AND WHISTLE) Marvelous! You like fireworks? - Enough. It's weird ... if you think about it, the fires are a hit - If you don't think about it, I'm a marvel. - Like life! But fuck off! Now do the metaphors too! The Milanese! (NOT AUDIBLE VOICES) The Milanese! Come here! Stop them, come up with something. -It's closed, I'm sick. - We can not! It is our duty! - "Where everyone flees, we go!" - Isn't that the motto of the fire brigade? But it's nice! "And entered the room reserved for it the mother found a letter hand written from the aforementioned minor. " - Well done! Not even one - Thank you. Letter that reads verbatim: 'I'm fine, don't come looking for me, don't break my balls'. He left an unambiguous message. - In your opinion, what should we do? - Hear these words! He's 12! Who didn't have it? Yet we are all here. - Let's leave him alone for half a day. - Are you sure you're a Carabiniere? I often ask myself. (THE MOBILE PHONE VIBRATES) It's Barbara. Ready? In Follonica? He drove 500 kilometers to go to find the Danish penfriend. - Who is? - I don't know, I have no idea. They have been writing to each other for two years and I didn't know, what mother am I? What does that have to do with anything? Rightly so. Why should he confide in me? I'm always angry, I hate everyone. He's right. I can't stand anyone, not even myself. - Do you know what? You go. - Huh? You go, without me, alone. - The? Alone? - Yup! I know myself as soon as I arrive I start to piss him off. I am like that! You have to go there. You can't go on the highway with this lighthouse. Even so, I don't think it's up to standard. - Thank you. JOHN:Listen ... I thought ... I'll come with you if you want. So, to keep you company. So much here ... And anyway ... the advice of slaps I could have saved myself. - Where are the others? - Giacomo goes to Follonica with Giovanni. - You go too! - Because? You have fun with them, what are you doing here? How can I do? I have reflux back, the fault of the swordfish. ALDO:I have an inflamed lumbar band! - Enough of this bullshit! That's enough! You know Zanardi? He has no legs and runs marathons! The marathons! RADIO:"This is Radio Italia, let's listen to 'How beautiful summer is'! " (MUSIC) Thank you. These are the moments where you see how much people are worth. Yes, but if you don't accelerate, in Follonica we arrive at Christmas! The limit is 90!

POLICEMAN:Good morning. - Good morning. - Do you know what the speed limit is? - He's absolutely right! - We're going to do a delicate thing. - We're looking for the son, he ran away. - He was there last night and not this morning. - A minor runaway? The police have been informed. Everything is under control. - Law enforcement? Where is your son? - He's not really your son ... - Of course? -He is a relative child. He is my son. GIACOMO:Okay, so? POLICEMAN:Now try on the other leg. I just don't know how to take it, that blessed boy! - I can't establish a dialogue. - That's the way it is at that age. I have two. One of 16 and the other of 13, The baby now she is obsessed and eats only kiwifruit. Now, come back on the line. With children it's all complicated, being strict or understanding, leave them free or check them? But something must be done! - What does she do? - I'll buy you kiwifruit. POLICEMAN: All right, now I'm sending you away. Good luck for your son. Thank you. It did me good to talk to her. It is thought that law enforcement are punitive, instead ... No, we are men too! They are 400 euros and six points of the license. Six points? Four for excess speed and two for the broken headlight. Scotch is not enough!

We do not read Ludovico's letters. - No? - As a matter of "privacy". For real? I read Iole when Else sleeps. I enter his room like a thief and I read them with the flashlight. Reading their stuff helps you understand them. - Listen, Ludovico ... - Yup? What exactly does it say in the letters? "Dad, dad ...", but then he ran away here! I understood this, you love your wife and she loves you. Ludovico loves you both, but every now and then you should tell yourself! ALDO: Pizza! Pizza! The sand is hot!
