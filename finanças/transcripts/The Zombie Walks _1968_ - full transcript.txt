In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. The family wants no photographs, Miss Ward. Yes. But my Boss, the Newspaper King, insists that I cover the event in pictures. In addition, He is famous for his charity to poor and needy village churches. Maybe he could think about us once in a while. Who is the man beside Sir Cecil? - Mr. Merryl, the family lawer. That I already know. I mean the gentleman on the other side. Dr. Brand, Head of the cottage hospitals. And beside him is Adela Pim, head nurse at the same hospital. Both are in debt to the deceased Sir Oliver. They've both made considerable contributions to the hospital. And now one expects the same from its successor, hm? Don't we all hope that? Sir Oliver was a great benefactor. It's soul and the souls of all in the faith going by like... rest in peace. Amen. (Singing) If I once am to separate, thus does not separate... Hello! Here speaks Edgar Wallace! Now my friends. Let us hurry back to the light. That was the voice of my brother. Oliver was laughing from the coffin. Dead ones do not laugh, Sir Cecil. - But I heard it! Everyone heard it! Nevertheless, You heard it too Dr. Brand! - Oliver is dead. If it were a laughter, then it didn't come from the coffin. - Who laughs on a funeral? The heir and the funeral entrepeneur. - I am Peggy Ward from ''London Star''. What do you have to say our readers? - The facts of the death of my... poor brother are well known to me. - We would gladly like to know more Dr. Brand, You identified the corpse? - I was one of many, who identified the corpse. - Even the ''London Star''... should leave the dead ones in peace Miss Ward. Here you are! - Thanks. Yet another beer! And in addition a rum. Yes, one must have that, when Sir Cecil pays for all. - Rum or beer? No wonder, that you West Indians have so amusing ideas. - You mean, I'm amusing, because I tell the truth? I heard Sir Oliver laugh in his coffin. And I saw it coming from the church. - Alone? Or had it a small pink elephant on the line? - I am not drunk. I know, what I saw. It was Sir Oliver. - Impossible! My customers do not walk. With us in West India corpses can walk. We call them ''Zombies''. Sir Oliver is a Zombie. Superstition! - What does a Zombie look like?? Exactly like you. A shade of your size. - You are mad! Oh, the nosy reporter who sniffs around. - Your voice it reminds me. Did you laugh at the funeral service? - Rather hold yourself. This here is no place for ladies. - I am not a lady. Ah, You must be the funeral entrepeneur who brought Sir Oliver to Crowfield. So it is, Madam. - I need your help. My sincere condolence. Do you wish a funeral or a cremation? Either both. What do you think about the rumor about Sir Oliver? I have been a funeral entrepeneur in Crowfield for 30 years. And never ever did a corpse laugh. - The funeral service must... strain your nerves. Is that why you come here for a drink? I'm happy being with the living. Any other questions? Where can I find a telefon? Oh, thank you very much! This is Peggy Ward. The editor, quickly! The sensation of Crowfield! A corpse laughs at his own funeral! The laughing corpse... Thanks a lot. The laughing corpse of Crowfield! The sensation of Crowfield! Thank you. The laughing corpse... Thanks a lot... of Crowfield! Corpse laughs at his own funeral! Hello, Nick. - Ah, hello! Morning, Inspector. Crazy huh, this thing with the corpse. - Yes, tell me about it. Keep the change. Thank you, Sir. The great sensation of Crowfield! Hello! God morning. - You still dare to show up here? For 2 hours I waited yesterday evening, for you to take me to dinner! That was wrong of me, but yesterday evening I had an appointment with a sexual molestor. You rather spend times with thugs, then with me! I'm a bird, that always fly away, Higgi. - Mabel, please don't call me Higgi. As long as I'm in the office, you must call me by my rank, understood? Understood, Inspector Higgi! Miss Finley? - Ja, Sir John? Sir Arthur, please, if I may? - Oh, shit! Miss Finley, I know, you admire Sir John dearly, or rather, love him! But you must not forget. He is 65 and he has a well deserved retirement. Well, I'm not the youngest myself, but nevertheless it would be very kind of you, if you in the future could use my name instead! That's not too bad, is it! God morning, Higgins, please do come in. Have you read that? - Yes. No case for Scotland Yard. We live in a free country, in which also the corpses laughs, and theres no law against that. - Why should a corpse laugh? Funerals can be tremendously merry. Dead ones doesn't have to pay taxes anymore. Or could be glad to loose its wife. - Sir Oliver was a bachelor. Perhaps he was tickled to death. - Or he discovered something pretty amusing. - Amusing, exactly! Miss Finley, have you ordered my ballet tickets? - Yes, Sir Arthur, thay are at the box office. - You have a weakness for ballet? My dear Higgins, when you for a long time been tramping around in police boots... like me, one expects to dance as elegant as Nurejev. Ol?! I know, that Oliver always carried this watch with him. It was found beside the deceased. That is a proof! But they didn't find his Scorpio ring. - Don't get crazy ideas. A ring could be lost in plane crash, disappear, burn to coal, to conflate, which I know! Your brother is dead, Sir Cecil. 10.000 Pounds, at the last rate. - Are you sure that it is the latest? The Lady has a very high price. - It is the latest, Merryl! Here. - I'll do it tomorrow. You still want you to drive? - Yes, I must be early in London tomorrow. It is very foggy. And... if one saw it again. Do not believe in this fairy tale anymore! Sir Oliver is in his coffin. Forever. Lock your door, tighten the curtains and you go to sleep. You are overtired. It's your nerves! God night. Hello? What is this? Hell... Sir... Sir Oliver! This is Peggy Ward! Give me the Scotland Yard, Inspector Higgins! Quickly! This is a dream come true! For two weeks I have lived on Spaghetti, only because I waited so much, for you to take me to dinner. Madam. Monsieur. - Thanks. Merci. - Thanks. Cheers! Mamma mia! - That is a Zombie. I absolutely wanted to try that. Zombies are known in West India as... the spirit of the dead, which rises from the grave. Am I right? - Right Sir. Let us have, two Crab-Mayonnaise. - Right sir. Two mexican ducks. - Right sir. And... - Right sir. For you, Inspector! Higgi, please don't answer! - Why not, maybe it's someone pretty as you. Yes? Yes, I'm on the phone. No. No! Yes, good. Yes, I'm coming! Cancel that duck! - Right sir. Inspector! - Yes, Stofford, what is it? I have found something in the back. Check for fingerprints on that right away! - Yes, Sir. Who is the murdered? - At the moment, were not sure if, there even was a murder. There are no indications of outside force. Mr. Merryl was frightened to death! - What? This is Miss Peggy Ward from the ''London Star''. - Ah, The writer of ''The laughing corpse''. An eyewitness of this murder. - As an eyewitness you should in that case be dead. As you can see I'm still very much alive, you can pinch me if you don't belive it. Not while I'm on duty! - Arthur, where are you? I thought, that we were going home to you? - Don't be so impatient my darling! Charming. Any referens points, Higgins? The traces are examined straight away. - Stop! Mr. Potter, the minister of Crowfield! - The reporter, which made my... church famous. And who are the gentlemen? - Scotland Yard. What? The police here? What happened? - Only a small murder case. Sir Cecil! He's been murderd! - Not him, his lawyer. Sir Cecil called me this evening and and asked, if he could visit me. But he didn't come. So I went looking for him. That's why I'm here. And why did he wanted to visit you? - Sir Cecil saw something this evening... his dead brother outside the window. That's for me. My wife worries, that I could get lost in the fog. So she helps me find the right direction. - Higgins! One moment, please. Higgins! That is also your direction! So, from now on you do your duty, and I do mine. Good night, Gentlemen! So, my darling, here I finally come! Have you waited for long... Donald! Thank God that you're here! We found Sir Cecil on the cemetery! Dead? - Unconcious! I called Dr. Brand, he's already on the way! He is coming round. What he needs is a proper sip of Whisky. We have only Sherry. - Take a look behind the large bible there upon the shelf. - But Inspector! Yes? Ah... oh, miracles! What? You are not the first minister in my career, Mr. Potter. Stop! I prescribe the medicines! - Good evening, Mr Doctor. Good evening. A heavy shock. His whole body has cramped in panic. The corpse have frightened him. - Do not believe such nonsense! But he obviously believs in it , Doc. Of course, this corpse is born, to a certern extent as a brain child. - I say! Mass hysteria! This here... will calm him down. Dr. Brand, would you tell me, where you've been this evening? In bed. - Anyone who can witness that? I am a widower, Inspector. - Then you could have many witnesses. Spare me such impudence... - Sir Cecils lawyer was murdered today. How terrible. - The perpetrator is surely from this area and is still around here somewhere. - Adela! What are you doing here? I have come from a birth of twins. - She is the village midwife? She is everything. She's my right hand. - I nearly drove over Ramiro. He lay in front of the cemetery, in the middle of the road. And he smells of Rum! Alcohol is poison to him! - Who is this man? Ramiro, our stone cutter. He lives overthere in the equiptment shed. Why did you bring him here? - I wanted to bring him home, but then I saw a shadow lurking between the gravestones. Did this shadow also have a face? - No, but Ramiro trembled and said, that Sir Oliver has risen from his grave. It was the shadow of my dead brother. His eyes also stared at me. A Zombie face. - He must be put to bed! Come here, Adela, Let's take him in here. If this corpse continues to run around, our village will be a lunatic asylum! - I would like to talk to Sir Cecil alone. Of course, Inspector. Miss Ward. They rattle, huh? - What? My legs. Sir Cecil, Do you know a reason, for why Mr. Merryl was murdered? My dead brother had him killed. - I rather believe, that this murder was committed by a living person, for personal reasons. Merryls valuables were all present, his wallet was untoched. How much did he have on him? - A nice sum, about 150 Pounds. Then it was a robbery. Merryl had an envelope with him containing 10.000 Pounds. I gave him the money myself. - There you are, that means, that the murderer couldn't have been a corpse. Dead ones normally don't need money. My brother was always a big spender. - Why did you give Merryl 10.000 Pounds? For a lady. - And who is this lady? That is insignificant. What is her name? I would prefer not to tell her name. A Zombie! Do you have 7 sorts of Rum? - Yes, Sir. There is 10.000. You... Where the devil have you been? - Pardon, I only had one beer. I did not think that you, would be finished so quickly. You have saved 10.000 Pounds, Sir. Therefore, I'm entitled to half. Hello, Inspector! Oh, Miss Ward. - What do you look for here at the press centre? I'm here about a few letters, which I lost yesterday. Have you read todays ''London Star''? - Your newspaper doesn't interest me. What a shame, You should read it. Oh, here comes my bus! So long! An interesting article by Peggy Ward. Here's the autopsie report, Sir Arthur. In both cases the cause of death was a blood clot on the coronary vessel. - Miss Ward already knows the murderer. Here it is! ''Both victims died after an appearance known as Zombies''. Zombie! ''Unfortunately, the Scotland Yard was not interested in the identity of this man. One assumes, that Scotland Yard at the moment is still more helpless then... What? ... the retired Sir John.'' That is an offence! Who leads the investigation here? You or Miss Ward? I demand a report! What do you intend? What do you plan to do? I am going to read, Sir Arthur. - Zombie! That does not help me. - Sorry, that I can't help you, with what you are looking for, Inspector. - I must be limited to things, that are not detectable in the human body, such as poison. Then I must check elsewhere. Perhaps: ''The poisons of the Aztecs''. An investigation on the arrow poisons of the primitive tribes in West India. By Professor N. Bound, London, 1967. - Yes, that's the one! My fault, we only have one copy of this book and I'm sad to say that it was lent out yesterday. Do you know by whom? - A... Miss Peggy Ward. Help! Help! - Miss Ward, Open up! Help! Help! Help! Oh, Darling, You kiss wonderfully. I am not kissing, I'm pumping oxygen into your lungs. You are classy. Make love not war. Pull yourself together, Miss Ward. You were nearly murdered! Murded? - Yes. The book, from the library which you snatched right before my nose, it saved your life. - Book? The Book! It is gone! The corpse must have taken it! - What corpse? The Zombie, who wanted to kill me! Did the corpse also laugh, perhaps? - Why do you not believe me? I would be dead, if you didn't had come! - That is one of the specialities of the Scotland Yard. - Why did he want to kill me? Perhaps he read ''The London Star''? - And why did he take the book? Surely for the same reason as you. - It was the only copy! I know. Professor Bound, London, 1967. Get well soon, Miss Ward, and lookout... for laughing corpses! Out of the question! We can not give you such information. We are in an urgent scientific work. Scotland Yard. Inspector Higgins. Yes, I thought, that it was all in the past. - In what past? Let me see, what I can do for you. - That would be nice. Unfortunately I can not help you, my boy. So long!. Professor Bound expects you. - Ah, how nice! Caution! The head is prepered with a deadly nerve poison. It could do you harm, Inspector Higgins. Please take a seat. So you are Professor Bound? - Yes. Is that also prepared? It is advisable, not to affect any articles or persons in this room. What concerns an affecting of persons, I know exactly, where my limits are. You are seeking information about a poison, that causes heart thrombosis and is not chemically... detectable in the human body? - How do you know? I read newspapers. - Is there such a poison? In the history of the aztecs much of such a poison is talked about. You wrote a book on the subject, which you withdrew before the publication. - I have not. The public prosecutor's office withdrew it. - Is it indescrete to ask, why? Not at all. My book contains references to how, one can manufacture the mentioned poison. How does it come then, that the London Library posesses a copy of this book, which the public prosecutor forbade? - That copy is a preprint. It is by the way, the only one that exits. Can you imagine a reason, why anyone would steal this copy? They could be interested for example but it was not necessary. Look. This was delivered to me this morning by post. I am very grateful for it. - Do you know the sender? No, but his name stands here. A certain Mr. Bannister. From Crowfield. - Bannister? Yes. - Thanks. What is that? I need peace, when I arrange for the eternity. And now the smile of Mona Lisa. Perfect! Sir... Please! Sir! Sir! No! No! How long has he been dead? - An hour at the most. No outside... Injuries, like in the other cases. - How do you know that? Did you see the other dead ones? What are you doing here, Miss Ward? Already pleasure seeking again? I smell Sensations. My nose is a warranty for my headlines. Or a nail in your coffin. From where did you know, that I would be here? Professor Bound was so friendly, in telling me, where to find you. Really friendly. And now you know, so hurry out of here! Fast. Goodbye. How come, that you are here immediately after the murder, Dr. Brand? We wanted to visit Bannister. We found him dead and informed you. Bannister and I were old friends. - Yes, Physicians and undertakers are surely always good friends. Do you know, how many lying in here on ice? Only a few, I guess. - For an undertakers business it is one... dead season. No flu epidemic, no contagious yellow fever. Only a few murders. They frightened me however! - Miss Ward! Dr. Brand, Sir Cecil asks for help. He saw his dead brother again. I will accompany you. I want to know the truth! What did you do in London yesterday and today? It was a very important thing. - Did you at least fetch the money? Sir Oliver did not consider our parish in his will. However if Sir Cecil would die within a year, the fortune becomes... divided in equal parts between you, the hospital... and Mr. Bannister. - Mr. Bannister was murdered tonight. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. - You say it so indifferently, as if you had expected it. - A minister buries so many humans, that he becomes indifferent. - For that reason death is... a part of our business. Is it not, Mr Minister? My brother was a devil! He was always a devil, as long as he lived. Sir Oliver did not hurt a fly while he lived. - You must know better, Adela. She loved Oliver. - Do not always tear up old wounds! Actually she loved me. When she heard, Oliver was inheriting the fortune, she suddenly loved him. - I was very young at the time. I became acquainted with Oliver after the accident. - What kind of accident? Oliver fell from his horse. He broke his hip and had to be operated. He lay for a half year in gypsum. I was assigned to nurse him at the time. Love despite the heaviest of obstacles, just like in film! When is the last time that you actually saw your deceased brother? It is about 18 years ago. I decided at that time, to leave England and break every connection with the family. - Beacause of him! Interesting. Please continue. - We don't have time, to listen to this family dispute. - We are investigating a murder, Dr. Brand! I am not a detective, just a physician. I mean, this corpse only existed in Sir Cecils brain! Leave this house, before you get sick in the head. Let's go, Adela. One would only believe me, if I was to be found dead. We don't hope that, Sir Cecil. The corpses we have are quite enough. Only one thing is for sure: Someone is making a rather bad masquerade here, and the only amusing thing is, that it even could be you. Your fantasies are dreadful. - Always, when a murder has happened, you were alone and without any witness! - Why should I have murdered Merryl? And Sabri... - Yes? Nothing! I know, that you were at the Nightclub, when Sabrina was murdered there. I did not murder her, absolutely not! - Then someone else... must have put your hat there. Someone, that we know. Stand still! Do you belive me now? Inspector! Inspector. Inspector Higgins was struck down. - Who was it that struck him down? I don't know. I only saw, a shadow disappearing in the fog. He needs urgent mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! Peggy, do you still have the photos from Sir Olivers funeral? - Yes. I need it. All of it. - They are lying in my darkroom. As I am on the couch? - Uh-huh. This corpse has an advertisement! Soon he will be bigger then Beatles. Next! This shows a detail, George. That was interesting! - Would you be so kind... and fill me in. What is so interesting? - Our attractive expert in poisons... and some stranger side-by-side. - Don't make it so complicated. With too many midwives the child is lost. We need a murderer, not a 100 suspects! - Next! Who is that? - Nurse Adela. She nursed Sir Oliver, for months when he lay in a cast. The two of them had a relationship with each other. I hope, that he's not lying in gypsum anymore. - Next! Sabrina! - The murderer? Sabrina was murdered, Sir Arthur. - Oh yes, of course. A great loss. Oh, she was an attractive person! This shows pictures of Sabrinas wardrobe. In that position she is less attractive. - Next! Oh! Could you make an enlargement, George. Of course I know who he is. That is Captain Rodney Woodbridge. I have a few questions to ask him. - He can not answer I'm afraid. He is dead. - That was very unfortunate. Can you tell me something about his personal life? Nothing unfavorable. He was a bachelor and was to be married... with one of our former Stewardesses. - Which one? Pamela Winslow. - Sir Oliver Ramsey worked last... at your company. Was Mr. Woodbridge the commander of this "bad luck" machine? Yes, but he was innocent. The machine fell and exploded on the ground. And since when is Miss Winslow not anymore with your company? For about a year. - Since the accident you mean? No, I remember exactly. She quit some days before it without notice. Why? - But Inspector, do you know the personal life... of your secretary? - Oh Yes I do! Do you have Miss Winslows Address? Naturally. I will pick it out for you right away. Taste good? - As you can hear. Here. Sabrina! Is the old man here? I said, is the old man in here! - Can't you hear that! Have you gone mad? - Just a moment. Where did you found that? - From Sabrinas second apartment, where a ''Pamela Winslow'' lived. Under that name she was employed as a Stewardess for Commonwealth Airlines. - Sabrina was the laughing corpse! I knew it, the corpse is a fraud! - We have the voice of the corpse, now we only have to find it's owner. - With 8 million inhabitants in London... seems like a small task for you. - Well, if you help me! Sir Arthur, where did we hear... the voice of the corpse for the first time? - If you know, please tell me, this is no stupid quiz show! - In the church of Crowfield. We have him! The minister is the murderer! The topic of today's sermon we take from Psalm 127: ''Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain.'' Amen. Dear parish, even our Lord cannot build a house without money. Therefore are we, his humble aide, dependent on your giving joyfulness. Each coin, when put into the collection box, is a buliding block... to the cathedral, in which our faith, our hope and our love is sacred. Oliver! He has come, to kill me! An ambulance! Quickly! Inspector Higgins? Yes, it worked like a charm. The laughter was heard inside the whole church. I also found the place in the church, where the loudspeaker system, was tapped into. Just a moment! An ambulance just past before me. I believe they will fetch Sir Cecil now. Thanks. Signing off. Caspar! Outside the visiting hours it's absolutely forbidden to stay in the hospital. I wait for Sir Cecil. - He will remain here for at least a week. I am responsible for his security. The hospital is safe. - Not this hospital. If you don't want to leave, I must call Dr. Brand! What can I do for you, Mr Minister? - I would like to speak to Sir Cecil. and contribute to his faith. - You can either speak nor make a contribution. Sir Cecil is unconscious, he lies in the X-ray department. In the X-ray department? Is he in mortal danger? - Why so afraid? Your church would benefit considerably, if he dies. Is it not so, Mr Minister? - Your hospital also! Fortunately we are both disinterested and stand tower high above such considerations. Why did you tie me up here? You brought me here, in order to kill me! Do not move now! I will take a photograph of your head. No! No! You'll kill me! Oh, don't talk such nonsense. Already over. Now rest yourself. I will develop this quickly. Oli... Oliver! Oliver, forgive me! Oliver. Sir Cecil cannot have committed the murder! I gave him a shot, that would have knocked down an elephant. - But Sir Cecil is no elephant! May I see the ampoule? - I threw it away. This is absurd! Why would Sir Cecil murder his beloved family doctor? For the same reason as his beloved lawyer! And his beloved funeral entrepreneur! - And his beloved Sabrina! Are you sure, that it was murder? It could also have been a heart attack. That is the illness for overworked middle aged men. Please, no need to get so personal, Yes! - Do you have experience with poisons? I have the experience, like all trained nurses have. There is a poison, that a hundredth milligramm within seconds... causes a blood clot in the heart. So died Sabrina! Sabrina. - Your voice reveals jealousy. Was Sabrina perhaps a lover to the deceased Sir Oliver? She could have been his daughter. - Overworked middle aged gentlemen often have young lovers, which also contributes to heart failure. Sir Oliver died in a plane crash. Which brought in 100.000 Pounds for you! - Will bring, if the insurance company pays. Sir Oliver was very generous, to include me in his life insurance. - See there! I'm looking at a very rich woman at your age it seems. - I don't have the money yet. Where is Sir Olivers patient report? - We... we don't have a patient report on him. - I mean from the accident. When he fell from the horse and lay in gypsum, for 6 months, under your affectionate care. I feel like a schizophrenic, yes, a divided personality. One part is director of the crime department, and the other as a simple burglar. Hands up! - Well! Forgive me. Peggy! - Ah, See there! And in a ballet leotard too! That is an offence to the art! I always wear my ''Emma Peel''-dress, when I have to break in somewhere. Give me the stolen documents! - I have only borrowed them, Inspector. And you can read everything about it tomorrow, as always in ''London Star''. Bye-bye, Gentlemen! She has a piece of evidence, that we look for. Why didn't you arrest her? Beacause otherwise, we would in addition also read that we didn't have a search warrant. We'll soon have more corpses than in Hamlet. Makes me happy, to see you again! - What do you want? You! And the patient report on Sir Oliver. Then you have to wait for a long time! - No problem. I'll just take it like this. So. And now we drive safely, so you can't do any more harm. Inspector! They want to kill me! - What are you going to do to him? We caught him on the cellar stairs, he wanted to flee! - On the cellar stairs? They are holding me against my will! - You are a murder suspect! Murder? - Yes, You are a prime suspect, we found your chauffeur Caspar murdered in the cellar of this hospital tonight! Caspar? Dead? - Where is nurse Adela? She was called to see a patient. - Sir Cecil must be well guarded! Nurse, you'll be responsible to me for his security! - You can be completely calm on that. I will pray for him. - I'm sure he will be pleased. I hope so. What do you think of this matter? - I'm afraid, that we have to open the grave. You mean, since we already broke into the cellar, we could... also break into another coffin, right? But not with me, my best one! Thank you, Sir Arthur. Don't think that you will go alone! - Ramiro will be there and help me. For Rum he'll do anything. Your favorite patient? - A patient like any other. He called for us, because he felt very bad. What did you give him? - He needed Antrophin. He must get to hospital urgently! - Is it danger for his life? Unfortunately always in these cases. Sister Adela, how could Ramiro know, that Caspar was dead? I don't know. He always receives his orders from the Minister. Goodbye, Inspector. Who gives you the right, to enter the church at this time? We are always in the service, Mr Minister. You for God and I for Scotland Yard. This is the house of God. Here the human power ends. And for those, who stole Olivers coffin? - Sir Oliver rests in peace. But not down there. The coffin is gone. - Then only Ramiro could know, who stole it. No one could enter the crypt, without Ramiro would have seen it. God be with you, Mr Minister. Here, take this ampoule immedeately to the laboratory for examination. Request reinforcements with Sir Arthur, we must lock and guard Crowfield. Where is the patient, the man the ambulance brought here? He's in the emergency room. Right back there. Inspector! This is a hospital here! - Are you really sure? Please leave me alone with Ramiro. - You came too late. He is dead. - What? I want that the autopsy report, signed by the head physician! Don't be ridiculous, Inspector. Do you really think, that I killed him? Who knows! Where is Sir Cecil? - He sleeps and needs his rest. He is guarded, as we arranged. And you can be completely calm about that. When I am calm, you will know the difference! Help! Help! Inspector, I take no responsibilty for the consequences of your behavior! Sir Cecil absolutely needs rest! Unlock! Do you have any more suprises for me? - He suddenly attacked me. Sir Cecil is mad. Dr. Brand wanted to transfer him to the psychiatry ward. So therefore he murded him? - He is violent, Inspector, but I don't believe, that he's the murderer. - Which you already know! Nurse Marit, you will be held responsible for, anything happening to Sir Cecil. Give word to all: Sir Cecil Ramsey is to be arrested! - Yes, Sir. What is the matter, Horley? - Patrol 4 have received a cable, that someone is playing the organ at the funeral home. It must be crazy people. Organ? Parker, you come along! Oh, Inspector! How nice that you are here. Now we can play four handed. I'm really pleased. Are you having a party here? - It would be nice, but I was attacked... and kidnapped and taken here. - Other ladies have constant companions. I've become your constant life saver. - Inspector! Is that so bad? - Needing any help, Sir? When I'm alone and need it, I call for you. Go on and search the house! Yes, Sir. Now tell me, who had you kidnapped? - The stranger. It is the Zombie. He threatened me and brought me here. - And why are you still alive then? Perhaps I'm his type. Just a moment! This is Sir Olivers coffin. Poor Sir Oliver. This is not it. - What? Peggy! Did you read the report, which you snatched from under our noses? Only briefly. You disturbed me, and later the stranger took it. Sir Oliver had a fall, and broke his hip. Was it nailed? Yes, with a steel nail. I remember it. Look for yourself. That's not nailed, the hip, is completely intact. This is not Sir Oliver. Parker! Mrs. Potter! Ms. Ward says, she heard your voice in the mortuary this evening! The young lady is a reporter. Do you believe all, that's written in the paper? It depends, in which. Where is your husband? - In the church. He prays. Who is overthere in the equipment shed? Ramiro after all is dead! God works in mysterious ways. Rise up! Rise up, I am, Inspector Higgins! It already has my name on the gravestone, that is the sign! He wants to murder me tonight! Today is Olivers birthday. He is a Scorpio! Scorpios never forgive! - What should he forgive? He won't get me. He won't get me, like the others! Not me! Come along, I'll bring you home to your house where you'll be safe. My people will guard your door. Come now. Perkins! All men to their posts! Every corpse is to be shot on sight! Yes, Sir. Light! Well! Well, what is this? How long am I going to wait? I will count to 3! 1 ... 2... 4... 5... How did this happen, Sir Arthur? - Yes, as, I entered the hall... when suddenly a "geezer" stood in the dark before me. Who, the corpse? - What? Yes! And I: did not run! You know me in those moments. With 2 or 3 Karate blows I had him... nailed down on the floor. But he was tough as a wild cat, because just... when I were to put on the handcuffs, he jumped up and pushed back. Ah, in the dark I probably fell against the fireplace... Fortunately you had your handcuffs nearby, Sir Arthur! You usually don't carry them with you. Yes, my dear Higgins, I have the 6th sense! Not everyone has such grace assigned to. - Yes, one could really say that. Take this to the laboratory for examination at once! This person wants to poison me! Your occupation has given you weak nerves. Better weak nerves than no conscience. Bottomless carelessness! - It is Valerian. Here, please, see what they found on the ampoule. - It will calm you down. Release me! - Just a moment! Get me loose... Help! Don't let them sacrifice me! Release him immediately! - Sir Cecil broke out of the hospital. I must take him back. - Sir Cecil remains here. I don't want, him to break out again. He stands directly under my personal protection. Protection? You'll leave me alone with with this woman, who wants to kill me? Like I said, he is clearly mad. - Don't believe a single word! If you return me to the hospital, I'm a dead man! Scoundrel! A harmless tranquilizer, Inspector! - There's your proof! She wants to kill me! On Olivers order! She is crazy! She killed all my friends! Yes. Now you keep 5 steps away from Sir Cecil and you are not to touch him anymore. 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, please! Take a seat! And you two disappear, at once. Scat, scat! We will be happy to protect you, but only if you will tell us the truth and not hide anything more. What would Sabrina get 10.000 Pounds for? Can't you imagine that? - You have paid four times already... within a year the sum of 10.000 Pounds. That makes a total of 50.000! For what? It was more cheaper, then to marry her! Sabrina was expecting a child. What you say, 50.000 Pounds for a pregnancy? That is enough for fivelings! Sabrina had an autopsy, she was not pregnant. Then she lied to me. It's the oldest female trick in the world. Let us look at the facts! Sabrina was a Stewardess and engaged... to the pilot, who controlled the plane, that Sir Oliver crashed in! Just before she quit her job without notice she deposited 10.000 Pounds on the same day to your account! - They were not for me. But the other 40.000 was from you! For what? She black mailed you. That's why you killed her. - That is not true! She puts the blame for the murder on me, because I was against the marriage to Oliver! Now he finally said it! I always knew, that it was he, who prevented the marriage. If we would have married and had children, he would never have become the lord of Crowfield or inherited the fortune. But now I am the lord! And Oliver is dead! - No, he is alive! You'd said so yourself. You are crazy! You are all crazy! That was a tasteless joke, Inspector! - But effective! Pst! Inspector! Well, from where does the wind blows? - From above. Somewhere there's a window open. There is probably no light up here. Aha, so that's why the wind blows. North northwest. The question remains, who opened it. Now we can only say, that we're hunting cats. How nice. There he is! - Who? What do you look for? - My pistol is down in my coat. Your Inspector seems to have problems. - But not for long! Don't leave me alone with her! If you come any closer, I will kill you! They will put you in a strait jacket, I'll promise you that. Leave that! This is a man's job! Oh! No! Congratulations, You are getting better each day! My fault, Higgins! - Was it you? Yes, but no time for apologies. Get the handcuffs! I have the murderer! Happy birthday! - I knew it! What? - You are Sir Oliver! Nonsense, I'm looking for him just like you. - Who are you then? I am Win Scott, Flight captain at Commonwealth Airlines. Captain Woodbridge, which had the fatal accident, was my friend. I never believed, that this plane crash was an accident. Too much spoke against it. Therefore I followed the whole thing on my own. I'm interested in Professor Bound, the sister of Captain Woodbridge. You have interfered in the clearing up of a murder case. That could lead to unpleasant consequences for you. - Not, if Sir Oliver is alive. And I can prove it. After me! The Minister! - Look after Sir Cecil! Idiots! Another corpse! It reeks up to Heaven! - It will not be the last one. It was very wrong, to leave Sir Cecil alone with you. He stood under your personal protection. - You are arrested! Come along! I could not tell you before, where Sir Oliver is, and I still can't. I do not want to loose the reward of the insurance. But just a tip: Go to the Vicarage. Your Inspector will need your help. I've already thought of that. Well you, come here, hurry! Empire Insurance, quickly! Come out of there! Amen, Mr Minister. Out! Forward! Quickly! Inspector, I would like to make a confession. Do you now. - My conscience can't bear it any longer, I can't hide the truth anymore. - Unfortunately your conscience comes a bit late. Sir Oliver! You are responsible for the murder of 5 people. You are arrested! - No. I am not Sir Oliver. I have nothing to do with these murders. I only have the coffin... which was snatched from the crypt, the insurance company offered me 2.000 Pounds. My wife doesn't know anything about it. - I have respekt for your... religious robe. But everything, behind it, is a lie. Hands up! You too, Inspector. Throw the weapon behind Mr. Potter. Adela. You know what to do. - Yes, Oliver. Stop that! A rapidly working gas. A gentle death. How do you turn of the gas? The lattice! There it goes! Just as we wanted! What is, Higgins? - This is the real Sir Oliver. How? What? Ramiro is Sir Oliver? I thought, that Ramiro was dead! It was my fault. Adela deceived me. I also believed, that he was dead. He needs a shot, otherwise he dies! - Give it to him then. Have you gone mad, Higgins? She will kill him. The ampoule, which you gave me, had Arsenic and Strychnin inside. Poison! He has Addison's disease, which can only be treated with Arsenic and Strychnin. This illness colours the skin olive-green. Only then was it possible for him, to pass as a Kreole. Not even his own brother recognized him. It is ridiculous, how you always save your secrets for the conclusion. Now he is really dead. But he fulfilled his Mission. - What kind of Mission? He was a murderer and no hero. What do know about that? Twice he tried to, murder Cecil. But he did not succeed. One feel ashamed about the aristocracy. - The third plan was complete. Merryl, Bannister and Dr. Brand helped him out, for money. Caspar, worked at the time at the airport, and had orders, to smuggle the bomb into the airplane, But... Sabrina had found out. For 10.000 Pounds she told Oliver about the plan. Do open the abyss! - Merryl had developed the murder plan. He had to die. Just as Bannister, Caspar and Dr. Brand. Sabrina could have lived, if she'd not been greedy for money, and black mailed Sir Cecil. And Oliver knew, that it would come to this... betrayal for money, in life. And finally: Cecil, the murderer. They all escaped from justice. But not you, Adela. I loved Oliver. I have nothing, more to live for. - You still have your memory of him. You can hear him laugh for the rest of your life! Hello! Here speaks Edgar Wallace!
