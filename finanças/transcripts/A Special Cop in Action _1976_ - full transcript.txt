I've got bad news sir, A whole bus load of School children have been Kidnapped. -Here comes the Commissario. -Is it true about the children? -Yes -Can these Parents afford to pay a ransom if there is one? -I dont know -Do you have any clues Inspector? -No I dont -So the police hav'nt done anything so far? The Police have done everything that they can do. But if the Press gave us a little more co-operation our job would be easier. Commissario is there any news? Have you found them? -You must know something -We have a right to know whats going on To know what progress you're making -The Police must find those Kidnappers! Thats exactly what we're trying to do, But you've got to give us a hand. Tell us any Information that you think might help us. What can we possibly tell you Inspector? They were simply normal children who went to school. And none of us are Millionaries What more can I say? You should've prevented this, You should have all these criminals locked up! -Thats not always possible -Why Not! They Deserve it! They've taken my son They've stolen my little baby boy! You have a sworn duty to protect us and our families, dont forget that, And you've failed if my Brother gets hurt. He's all I have in the world He means everything to me. We'll find your Brother. Maybe we should take the little Bastards something to eat. And see if that will shut them up. Shut Up! Come on Kids Here's your Dinner. And maybe you'll stop yelling so much. I wanna go home! I want my Mummy! Let me go you bad man! Stop talking you little Bitch! Damn You! What the hell are you staring at! Eat your food, Hurry Up! Why ar'nt you eating? Something a matter with you? He's been sick. Be sure to keep on eye on Porta Paltza -Is that all there is? -And the usual Hoax Calls. I'd teach those Practical Jokers a lession if we could catch the bastards. -And the Search Parties? -Nothing Yet. -They're keeping at it but its a hopeless job -They must keep on looking. -The only weapon we have is Patience. -And thats not the weapon you'd like to use. It breaks my balls feeling so helpless. Simply thinking about those poor kids at the mercy of those shits, it drives me crazy. "Calling search Parties Three and Four Please indicate your location and findings" We're at the Pariarti Farm. This is Party Five, We're at the Mill in larno Its time you had some rest. At this time they could be any place in the whole damn country. Even a Hundred yards from Headquarters This is obviously the work of Professionals -Hello -Who'se speaking Mrs Georgie? -Who is it!

Where was it? -They're tracing the call -Let me listen for a minute, Can you locate him more precisly? That will have to do. Did they trace it? It was to short for them to finish, they only got as far as somewhere West of Milan. -It does'nt help much -It sure does'nt! Besides they could've telephoned from Milan to mislead and confuse us. The trouble is we have to check it out even if its a fake, with one lead we could blow it. Listen Ferrari Telephone Milan I want you to get me Commissario Arpino This is the main highway and here is the resturant. Thats where we head for as soon as they hand over the ransom money. They'll be three cars waiting with false documents and Passports. We'll split up there Hey listen why dont you take over from george guarding the kids. Change of air will be good for you. I'll decide whats good for me. Go and take over from Torri -What! - Take over from Torri! And I dont want to hear any buts! And make that kid shut up too or I'll shoot him. Look that kid is in a bad way he's really sick you know. So give the little bugger a slug of whisky so he'll fall asleep and stop whinning. -You know Milan never seems to change -Yeah -Except the crimes rate goes up. It sure does up and up you'd think the criminal classes are trying to break a record. Yeah but for my money this kidnapping of children is the worst kind. I suppose you've already got started hav'nt you. As you know the call came from the outskirts west of the city, And we're suspicious of this area full of Abandoned farms. You'll have to search it carefully,naturally we'll follow any leads in the meantime. -And thats all we can do -I'm sorry to drag you into this. With any luck it'll be my last I'm retiring next month. You mean that? You're just a kid look at you. Yeah sure, just a kid with his balls in pieces I dont have the energy to fight the criminals, we're up against nowadays. And Besides, My daughter... -Thirsty? -No thanks. ...has just got married and moved to a house by the lake with great fishing. And you already see yourself up to your ass in grandchildren. But you realise that your running out on us. I have to hand over the reins to youngsters with faith and enthursm and a bad temper like you -I'm bad tempered alright. With certain types of Criminals I lose my self control.

Yes, Thank you. -How come you stopped working, you were a great Mechanic. -Here -Thank you -Your Welcome. There was trouble there, they said I was a car thief. So they fired me, who could expect that people could be so unfair. People are mean. Wont you have some? Go on.

We're making our way to the centre of the area, Stay in communication. Out. You know the Girls description of the man fits Salvatore Mancuso And the one we find behind Mancuso Is Albertelli - Could be. Albertelli could be the one who organised this kidnapping. Rescuing the Kids is our number one priority, then we'll get the rest of them. -Its the Police -They can't have found us! -Something must've gone wrong -Now what do we do. We move the children over here so we can keep them under control. Torri!

No-ones gonna believe it happened Naturally. Thats fine, we want them to think that. There they are I can see them. There are three men moving children from a silo to a shed, five or six children. This is it Arpino, now its our turn -Calm down. Its not going to be easy to make those bastards give up the kids. Dont come any closer! Stay right where you are! We'll have to make a plan of attack We're going to need men and equipment, Thats already been arranged. -Well whats the situation? -Its a mess. -Have you notified all the Parents? -Yes they've got the money together. The whole city helped, everyone wanted to contribute, but it'll take time to arrive They've given us an Ultimatium. They said they wanted the money for the kids in Half an hour. Or they'll start shooting them all. -I see have you tried reasoning with them? -Yes Obviously! -Then we have to go on trying. -Well! The half hour is nearly up. You'll get the cash soon. And a getaway car, you'll only have wait a little longer. Wait for what, for one of your snipers to shoot me. -Get them out of sight. -Hey you. -Pull back! -You're trying to pull a fast one Inspector.

Alright Hero, Come on. -Follow Me -You must be Crazy! -He's Clean -Let the kid go. -Mommy! Quick Ferrirari Come on. All Patrol cars watch carefully to see if the kidnappers remain on the highway. Do not approach them and try to stay out of sight. And if there is any change of direction, notify me by Radio. -I wonder how many cops are on our tail? -Alot you can count on that. It wont get them anywhere if they try to pull a fast one , we'll do the same -Keep as far you can, but dont lose sight -Ok Sir. Now! Whats that? Those god damn sons of bitch's Betti! Betti! -Call an Ambulance. Hurry! The cars are in the other parking lot. Severe Bruising to the right Shoulder A lot of Scratches, but nothing to worry about. Not sure if it was down to luck or his exceptional Physical condition. -Can we visit him? -Best if he rests for today -Ok Thank you doctor. -Not at all, Good Morning -Good Morning. You better get some rest Commissario, I dont mind waiting -Thank you. Good Morning Commissario. We'll have a problem Identifing the corspe. And you can sure he'll have nothing on him that would help us. -We know one thing this was no accident. It has all the signs of a Gang Murder alright Guy gets out of line and they sort him out. -Dont touch anything until the Lab Boys have looked over it -OK -Commissario Betti -Come Right in Miss. -You're Finished Nurse? -No -Thats what I thought come on. I've wanted to visit you for several days, But I did'nt have the nerve. -Are you better now? -Yes the damage was'nt too bad,. I really have to apologise for the way that I behaved. When I found out that my Brother was dead. -It was an awful shock -Yes I'm sure. I Know you must have suffered Dreadfully. Thats no excuse for what I said for insulting you. Please dont let it bother you, you'd be surprised how often it happens -Forget about it -Right now the future looks bleak, It was so Horrible, -And I'm so Loney now -I know, I often feel like that. I spend hours and hours by myself. Alone in the house, which is to big just for one person. But if your in the Police You cant allow yourself a family. My Father was in the Police Force as well. A Sixteen Year Old Kid Shot him, trying to get away from a Robbery. Sorry to Interrupt Here's Commissario Arpino Well I'll be going now. -I hope I'll see you again -I'm sure you will,its a small world. -Hows the Rest? -Ok not bad -Hows the case any progress. Well I've been doing all I can. Mancuso is the only lead we have. -May I? -Sure -But even though he's known, as a associate of Albertelli, it does'nt prove he was behind the kidnapping. I know, I wish we could dig up some proof. I want to get that guy, he's top man on my list. The trouble is the Judges all say what a respectful man is his. How long are we going to put up with it Arpino, letting him spit on us. Betti control your temper remember your getting better. Its drives me crazy whenever I think Albertelli Managed to get a profit from that poor boys corpse. He's not gonna get away with it. I know one thing if we dont pin one thing on him that will get him out of circulation for good, I'll break his damn neck myself. And I know where to find him. Well look whose here What an unexpected pleasure. Two cops at the same time, Can i offer you a drink? We dont drink when on duty. What you doing here Betti, I thought you were in Hospital in Turino, I see you want to ask the questions. My Lawyer. Yeah the same old bunch. -Good Morning. So your out of the Hospital now? Are you clean now? Relax. -Your Massage? Yes. Well Albertelli what kind of story do we get today? -About what? -Last weeks Kidnapping. What a Horrible thing. -Stop a minute -Very well Sir. What am I suppose to know about that all I know I read in the newspapers. Too bad about that dive you took from the car, you look like you'll live. I was very Lucky. Or your men were too chicken to murder for you. -You must be disappointed -You're on the wrong track. Where do you get off trying to put that on me. Its not Possible, its a contridiction. -Why is that? -I not a bandit like you think, If I had done it. First. I would'nt had accepted you as a hostage instead of a kid. And second. If I had accepted the exchange you'd be six feet under now. I'm sorry Albertelli I want to see you in my office in the morning, I want a statement, and you have to keep us informed of your whereabouts -Certainly. -Even if you're leaving town for a few hours -Just a minute Commissario -No it'll be ok. It will be like visiting old friends. We know each other really good, -Is'nt that so Betti? -You think your unbeatable, Dont you Albertelli? A real pair of jerks. Thank you Sir. -Come on lets go and dance. -No I'm sorry -Come on just one. No I told you I had things to do -Please come on. -Come you kept me here for an hour about that man who was burnt. -Come on one dance -No someone is expecting me. Just one dance, you can telephone if you have too. You know how much I want you. You've convinced me. -Commissario -Yes -This is Fabbri I've discovered the identity of that body you found in the burnt out car. His name was Salvatore Mancuso, the others are named Rocchi and Torri. Good work Fabbri, and keep in contact with the girl she could be useful. This was Salvatore Mancuso's Appartment. -Did he have visitors -Yeah Plenty. -What kind of people You know, men women all sorts. A very nice job. They beat us too it. -I figure it was the guys that burnt the body. -Commissario Arpino Yes. Look at that. That's our man even if the name is wrong, ID is false. Why do you suppose they murdered him? For stupidity, If he had left that girl alone. We'd Still be looking for them. In this crowd if you make a mistake you pay. I've been wondering that money those guys collected how did they get rid of it? I dont know, I think they're trying to sneek it into Switzerland But why are you so interested are you a Tax man? Just a minute hold on there's someone who wants to talk to you. -Its the guy I've been expecting -Lets go. Well if it aint our old pal The Stool Pigeon In the car! Grab his leg. Put him down Stop! -Ok lets go -No! No! This will cool him off. Even better than a Rollercoaster. -Morning -Good Morning. -Horrible -We should'nt make policemen do this You cover the other end, I'll come in from this side. -Watch it -Shit the Police, Beat it! The Cops, Block them! Hey! Come back with my Car! Give me Headquarters, I'm at the Market, The two suspects have escaped in a BMW, Followed by Commissario Betti in a Fiat two door -Lets go faster, Step on it! -It's all she's got. -That son-of-a-bitch is catching up -There's no more bridges, he cant cross. If we can make it to the main road we'll be ok. Look Out! The train's coming. For God's sake slow down, we're going to hit him -Shut Up! I've got something for them -Which Floor is it? -Fifth Commissario. - Ferrari! -Yes Commissario -He's trying to get to the back streets. Wait for the Commissario. Out of the way. Hold it! Dont Move! Get your hands up! Come with me! -He cut in front of me -Notifiy headquarters How are you feeling Ferrari? How many times do I have to explain I was working for Mancuso -I was suppose to deliver the money And those others Torri, Rocchi I'd never seen those before either And as I understand Luzzi, the one who organised everything was Mancuso? -Yes -Ok if you want to be a smart ass. But you'll pay for it, you wait and see. Mancuso! Mancuso! How many times do I have to tell you. Yeah sure and he was murdered. And Luzzi was'nt and he said the organsior of the kidnapping -Was your Boss Albertelli -No No Commissario I dont believe you and I've never heard of Albertelli. You're trying to pull a fast one on me. Listen to me you Bastard! I know about Albertelli. And you confirm what you know Or get your Jaw Broken! Betti. -Here I am Commissario -We're throught with him. Listen Betti We cant afford a scandal. Yeah I'm sorry, you're right But with that type of criminal, Its the only way to operate What about Luzzi? Nothing the usual He wont help anybody. -Albertelli knows how to keep out of it -There must be a way to drag him back We need Patience And thats Important. -Here's the report you wanted -Thanks -You need the others right away? -There's no rush -Alright Commissario. -Good Morning Commissario -Ah Cacace Can we talk somewhere maybe a coffee or a cake? You've got a good memory What can I do for you? How come your hanging around here? -I wonder if I can have a word -Come into my Office -Thanks. -Shut the door -Sure. You dont realise the favour you did me that day, I decided to turn over a new leaf. And if you forget about some of the other things over there, And I get my Driving Licence back and I can get a job. You look like you've had some luck at the races. -It was a Gift -Sit down -Ok I really mean I can get a job If I had my driving licence back. -Some old friends have been helpful Yes but they may want something from you in return. Oh no Commissario What would Lazzari want from me. -Lazzari? -Sure thats who it was. He's offered to get me a job as Chauffeur to some bigshot. If this does'nt work I'm finished You know that better than me, Anything Wrong? Have I said something I should'nt? No not at all I can fix getting back your Licence. -Cacace -Yes Mister Albertelli Listen Albertelli, we simply want you to take it off the boat. -As you agreed -That stuff is pretty hot. -Keeping it on the Boat is risky Come on, Come on. It's just a few days to find the best way to get it out the port. Look the Boat club has always worked as a good cover before, Right? -I only ask for a couple of days -Alright then. But dont forget You have to act carefully. If you dont watch your step Commissario Betti will get you. For that Kidnapping. That problem is already resolved. Relax boys. Everything with go smooth Just like always. Good Driving Sixty One Minutes From Milan to Genoa I think you should have taken up racing. I get enough kicks as it is. By the way I want to let you off at Headquarters, I'm gonna call on our friends alone. Why's he come Poking around? Evidentially they've discovered action at the club so.... Enough Evidence to send you up God knows how much they have. Its not my ass he wants Its yours. Where's the Proof Its your scene here. And dont make that face I'll find some way to get you out. Yeah sure you will But when? In a month, six weeks or it even could be a year. Yes it might even do you some good Lazzari Think Lazzari, they'll find somewhere to put you to go Cold Turkey. No! I could never take it. I'd go out my head in Prison. Then you better have another They wont have that in Jail either. I'll Murder him, the Bastard! That Pig... Get rid of it! You Killed him. You're not a Cop. You're an Assassin! -You always were -He Fired at me first. -He had a Pistol -What Pistol? Lazzari had no gun. I heard Two shots. Well go on... Find the Pistol. Where is it? You invented it to justify this! One of your boys took it. You've screwed yourself good this time. Have you read the papers? They're all against you. They say you are too.... Hot Headed. Of course what would you expect them to say. I believe your story and I'm sure that eventually everything will be cleared up. -But for the Moment -The Law requires you to, Make out a warrent for my arrest. -I assure you you have no idea How embarrassed I feel, Unfortunely the witness's, Heard only your shots. And as for the gun... Which according to you had been fired by the Victim. -They hav'nt found it -I want to be arrested at once. By Commissario Arpino, I'd rather it be done by a Friend. First the Whole Hand. Now the fingers. Look I've given you a cell by yourself, but dont take any chances. You have many enemies in this prison. So good luck. Alright...Lock him up! "Commissario Betti held on Murder Charge New Light on Police Brutality" I cant say anyone is too broken up about him getting his. This is a lesson he deserves when he gets out... -I bet he's not such a ballbreaker -I dont expect him to get out of jail Alive I meant to say. He's hated. I would'nt be surprised at all if some con tries to get revenge. And you know better than me There's nothing easier, Than a stabbing in prison Everyone looks the other way. Nobody knows what happened except the guy that gets it. And he wont tell anyone If its done right. So I guess I should talk to one of my pals inside. Well you always have good ideas. You have a Visitor Commissario. I saw the headlines yesterday. I've left a carton of cigerattes for you downstairs. -Well I hope you smoke. -No. I've bought you this to read as well. -You've read it have you? -Yes. I'm sorry it looks like I hav'nt been too much help to you. Oh No, what you've done is much better than a gift. You've thought of Visiting me. Thank you. Besides I'll read it again It's one way to make the time pass. -Do you think you'll be out soon -I dont Know. I have to admit they really trapped me. -By the way if you want anything please ask -Yes. To see you again. Hey why you over there come and join us. Duty Guard! -Whats going on? -It's getting out of hand. They're threatening Commissario Betti That's enough shouting Shut Up and Calm down. Get them back inside. Calm down and back to your cells. What the hell is going on in here. If you wont talk to me you can talk to the judge instead, Meanwhile you can think about it in the tank. I doubt that even a judge would frighten him. He's got life already He can commit murder again. Just for on the safe side, I'm going ask to move you elsewhere, Whats the Difference... There'll always be a con ready to kill me when Albertelli gives the word. -Are you sure this convict was acting on Behalf of Albertelli -Very Sure. The first move was outside now he's moved again. And I feel certain there's one thing you can count on. If I remain Locked away If I cant use my own methods. Albertelli is free to make a third move. But you cant be free'd all that easily. There just is'nt any way without any new evidence. We're aware of the difficultly. But I'm following a new line now and if it works, Betti wont be remaining in prison. Nice to hear, the old lion is finally showing his claws. You'll never guess how long I spent on this model. Well.... I really have no idea. -A year and Five Months -No... -Yes I was studieing I could'nt work on it that much -I see. -Here's Pop now -Hello Honey -Hello Dear. Hi Pop. -Evening Commissario -Evening Morel Thanks dad you remembered. You see I just got my results the highest marks in the class. My complements Morel your blessed with a marvious family. A Charming wife and an Intelligent son. He told me he wants to go into Navel Engineering. Thats an interesting Profession. When he told me that you two were old buddies I invited him in. -Ar'nt you glad, I invited him to dinner -No. Thank you. Although I can smell some mouth watering odors but duty calls. I wanted to see Carlo surrounded by his wonderful family. Carlo is the home loving kind. He's very proud of Guido, you'd think he was a Engineer already. No its not often that one runs into people like you. And Carlo has every right to feel proud. Excuse us I have to ask Carlo a couple of questions. Why wont you understand our time is valuable. We have already given you an extra two days. Now keep to the bargin. Look I got to be careful, that son- of-a-bitch Betti got out of Prison. -You got to understand -We've got to get out in 48hours. I really mean that Albertelli. I think you better get going. Its a Ultimatium. -There's always someone on the boat. -We'll wait to hear from you -Alright. -Tomorrow, I'll sort everything out Ok? -Ok. -Cup of Coffee -Hey how long do I have to wait for a cup of coffee. Have a Coffee on me. Let me treat you. -In honour of my Freedom -Commissario its a miracle. You're the very last person I expected to bump into this morning. I now you wont believe it But I'm happy you're out. Even if I killed your Friend, Lazzari? That was a dirty trick, even by crooks really dirty, Even using that boozer, the whole thing was carefully planned. But I'm glad that you got out safe. -However you still work for Albertelli -What choice have I got? I've only just started to work, I want to work for someone as an Mechanic. -I have a way -I think you're sharp The type of man I admire -Thanks Commissario. -If I can ever help you.. -You've already been so good to me. I'm not going to forget it I wish I could repay you. I like the Three wise monkeys I dont like to be a spy. There is something though Keep an eye on the old Harbour. -Tomorrow where they keep the boats -Thats Excellent. I hope it will be useful to you I'm finally good for you after all. Hey is that Coffee ready yet? -Cacace -Yes Sir Mister Albertelli. Hey for God's sake You'll kill someone like that. Lie still it could be dangerous Lie still Mister Albertelli, -I'll call a Doctor -I'm a Doctor whats happened? It all happened so fast, he was knocked down by a motor cycle -He should be taken to hospital right away, -I'll give him a sedative -Ok dont move. How are you feeling now? Where am I? You were struck by a Motorcycle You have a bad fracture of the leg, -How long have I been here? -Twenty Four Hours. Twenty Four Hours! It's nearly 12Oclock Mid-day The 5th of June. The accident happened yesterday today is Saturday. -What are you doing, keep still -Let me use the telephone. I'm sorry our Switchboard is out of order, we've reported it. My Chauffeur where is he? -He's outside, waiting -Send him in quickly. Call him in please. You can come in now. Mister Albertelli I was beginning to get worried about you When the Chauffeur comes out give him the injection at once. Its Important that you find Forestier Tell them what happened to me and that everything is postponed. And that they should wait for my orders. Well Major is he hooked -He thinks its tomorrow. -Sir Ah yes he asked for his Driver. -Now we'll find out something -Have you found out anything else? No but we're checking his story. Albertelli definitely has plans for tomorrow in the morning. Somewhere at the docks. He gave me a message sir. To contact his partners and tell them its all off. -Who are they? -Bertoli, Attardi and Forestier -Great I think we'll give them a call -Ok I'll notify the operations centre. -What shall I do, tell him I've told them -That wont be neccessary, He's sound asleep again. -Taxi - Take me to the port to the small quey And Hurry. Dont lose sight of him Keep down. That makes all three of them. I wonderwhat they're up to with Albertelli. Arms or Drug Smuggling Lazzari's club provides a good front. Smuggling by Sea can be very easy. The Customs will want to hear about this, and we need to give that boat a look. -Yes Sir -Arrange for a Search Warrent. -What's worrying you? -I dont know, I thought i saw something. -Any Sign of Albertelli? -He said Morel would be, Coming over in the motor launch and so far there's been no-one. I'm Nervous when things go this way. -I wonder if he's trying to put one over us. -I'll phone the club. Yes Go Ahead. -You mean he has'nt been in at all? -No -But has'nt he telephoned? No nothing since yesterday No No. No he never told me to collect any stuff, with a motor launch, never. Here's the Customs Launch. The Customs! We're shafted. Thats not all. -Look its the Police! -Lets get out of here! And you'd better beat it too. Ok take it easy, look natural. Come on. Carefull Keep under Cover. Send Reinforcements and an Ambulance. Damn! Fucking Son-of-a-bitch! "And here is the latest news report.." "A fercious gun battle took place this morning" "In the Port District of Genoa" "Between the Police and Three Criminals Suspected of Smuggling" "Two of the Criminals were Killed and Four Police Officers wounded" "The Dead were well known underworld figures" "Commissario Arpino who organised the Operation leading," "Leading To the shooting was struck and Injured" "By the car driven by the Third Criminal as he made his escape" "The Police are searching the area for this man, known as Forestier."

Hi Arpino -Have you seen the Good news? -No But the newspapers are full of it. How am I supposed to read the newspapers without my Glasses. There you are. "Mob Vendetta Murder, Albertelli Gunned down, Shot at Airport" Poor Fellow Albertelli You could've warned the guy that he was in danger. Well I would have warned him But he never asked. You know I spoke to your Doctor. You'll be on your feet in no time. Yes sure, lets talk about other things. Anyway at the end of next month I was going to retire. As for my fishing, someone will carry me. Nonsense your going to walk on your own legs. Listen Betti You ought to start thinking seriously about things -Times passing you're still young -Yeah I realise that, I often find it loney when I'm in the house at Night. Say have you seen that girl again? Come on the whole truth. I dont know how you do it always the Detective even in bed. I'm sorry but the Doctor said he could only have five minutes. -So Long -So Long. Subtitled by LqGb
