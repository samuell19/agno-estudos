Where do you think you're going, huh? Where do you think you're going? Where do you think you're going, huh? - No! - Get up! I don't wanna do it anymore! Please... Please don't make me. Please don't make me. Please... Mm! Hey, I'm glad you guys could make it. You enjoying yourselves? It's plenty more where that came from. Who's winning? What do you mean who's winning? Brian and I got this on lock! Three games in a row! Renee, God don't like no braggart. You know what? If God was this as good at Spades, he'd brag too. Well, we need to switch it up after this. Tired of getting your butt whipped? Tired of seeing your ugly face. What, is it happening again? A couple of times a day. I told you to go see somebody about that. Mm, I ain't got no time to be waitin' all day in urgent care. Just a couple of aspirin, and I'll be good as new. Hey! Hey, enjoynig your birthday, baby? - It's the best one ever. - Yeah? You guys go wash your hands. We're gonna cut the cake soon. Yeah? Mmkay. Mmkay. Mia? What? No, that's not nece... Mm, mm. Okay. Huh, yeah. Bye. Who told her? Why? She's her aunt! She's not welcome here, and you know that. I told you. You knew? I don't understand why you guys hate her so much. You didn't have to grow up with her. It's not my fault Grandma didn't have enough room for all of us. I just don't understand why you guys hate her so much. Yes, she did kill a person. But he was beating on Venus. I don't condone what she did, but... I'm not gonna hold it against her. That is not it. Mia Ann is... She's here. What did I do? Just play. You got a lot of nerve showing up here. Don't talk to my mom like that. Uh, it's okay, baby. Just go get the things out the back. Why so much venom to someone bearing gifts? I told you, I don't need anything from you. Oh, all of a sudden? Because when your heat was off and your funds was low, my money was good enough for you then. That's because it involved Cameron. Didn't want her freezing. And just like then, I'm here for Cameron again. Where should I put this? Back in the truck, 'cause you're not staying. Oh! I see you invited the others. They're her family. I'm her family. I love her too. I mean, nobody's perfect, Patricia. And you let her stay with Renee, and she got a different man at her house every week! And Brian? He can't think his way out a paper bag, he's so dumb. The only one who don't give me problems is Yoyo. That's because she lived with Grandma after Mom died. Well, you could've moved in with her. No, I couldn't! She already had seven of us in her two-bedroom house. The rest of us had to stay with Venus and you. Yolanda don't know what you forced us to do to each other. We were kids! We were stupid! Now we gotta move on! You were supposed to take care of us! I am not here to fight. I came here so that my niece can have a memorable birthday. Auntie Mia? Hi, baby. Are those for me? Of course they are, and I got something else for you too. Wow! Cam Cam, give back the money. But... Give the money back. Go play with your friends. What about my gifts? The adults are talking. Go on, now. Yes, ma'am. Now, take your gifts and your tired-ass daughter... Excuse me? Back to your SUV and get the hell out of here. People change. Isn't that what you read in your Bible? Forgiveness? God forgives. I ain't God. Patricia... I love you, sis. Come on with the damn bike. If you just gonna sit there and be angry, you could go to your room. Why couldn't I keep the gifts? When it comes to your auntie, things are complicated. But it was $40! Baby, not all money... is good money. I don't understand. How can I explain this? Okay, in the Bible, it says that money is a protection. It can be used to pay for things we need, like food and clothes. Or the doll I was gonna buy with the money. Yes, or the doll. But sometimes, people get money by doing bad things, by hurting others. Aunt Mia's family. She would never hurt me. Unfortunately, sometimes the ones that hurt us the most are family. Did she hurt you? Come here. Listen. I know you're upset about today. But I did what's best for us. And I promise, next year, your birthday is gonna be even better than this one, okay? Now, let's clean this up and get ready for bed, 'cause we have a lot to be thankful for. And forgive us our debts as we have also forgiven our debtors, and do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Amen. Mom? Yes, baby. Where's God? Mm, well... God is omnipresent. Do you know what that means? It means that he is everywhere at all times. - Even now? - Mmhmm, yes. Even now. I bet that's pretty hard for you to imagine, huh? Can you name something that you can see? There's a lot of trees outside. Yes. Well, from now on, whenever you see a tree, let that be a reminder that you are never alone. God is with you. Okay? Okay. Go to bed. What's for breakfast? Oatmeal. Do we have any sugar or butter? No, we're all out. There's syrup if you want to sweeten it up. I know you're sick of it, but it's all we have today. And we're thankful for it. Grace! Milk... - Mama? - Yes, baby? You can use the money I got for my birthday to buy something else for breakfast. Aren't you generous? Won't be necessary. Eat your meal. Mama! Mama, please, wake up! Mama! Mama, wake up! Please! Mama! Wake up! A damn aneurysm. I told her to go see a doctor. I don't know what we're gonna do. I'm just sayin', she's been complaining about her head for weeks now. No one ever listens to me. Uh-huh! Yeah! No, I can take her. For sure. You missed a spot. Come on, now, Renee! I said it's not a problem! Yeah, that's my niece, and I will take her. Okay. O-O-Okay. Yeah, just let me know what time. Okay, all right, baby. Okay, talk to you soon. Is it positive? I don't know. I can't tell. Well, you got any more? That was the last one. Oh, you are such an idiot! Clean up this mess! Whatever... What you say? No, I think I heard you say something. Didn't you hear her say something, Chris? Yeah, I heard her say something. I just couldn't make out what she said. I think she done forgot who I am. But I'm sure about to remind you. Bring her to the kitchen, please. No, no, no. No. Are you serious? I got enough on my plate already. Please tell me these are not for today! They sure are! You have an hour. What... - Hey, Gail! - Ugh... - Gail! - Josh... - Hey, there. - Mmhmm... Oof! Wow, you look, uh, rough. Yeah, listen, I need a favor. Yeah, no, you're all out of those. No, listen, listen, Gail, look. You already know I'm skating on thin ice with Rob, right? If, if I show up to court lookin' like this, it's a wrap. Yeah, well, you know what? While you were out on maternity leave, I covered for you. You're back. I'm done. But these are the easy ones. I've already done most of the work. Most of the work, huh? So easy. Fine. Thank you. Gosh! Look... All right, what we got? You reviewed Mia's profile? Yes. And done all the background research on the case? Yes, yes, of course! All good, right? It's so easy. Fine! Again. But you know this classifies as a baby shower gift, right? - Noted! - Yeah, noted. - Yes! You're the best. - Josh, god! - Love you! - Yeah, whatever! What are you doing here? Happy to see you awake. Good, water. You got it? I brought a present for you. Mama! How's my baby? Mm... I'm good. I miss you. I miss you too. How long I was out for? Right around three... - Days? - Weeks. My god, I gotta get outta here. Wait a minute, now. See, the doctor said you need to take it easy. No stress, no sudden movements. The best thing for you is to rest. What's best for me is that I go home and take care of my baby. Cam's all right. Gave her lunch money, bought her some clothes, 'cause that girl's growing like a weed. Like I told you, sis, I love you, and I love my niece. Why don't you just let her stay with me? And I'll keep bringing her here to visit you every day, even when you get home. And then when you're ready and feeling better, she can come home to you. Guess you was right, huh? People can change. All right. She can stay with you... until I'm feeling better. You're doing the right thing. I'mma let y'all two spend some time together. - Mia? - Hm? Thank you. Hi. Josh Goodman, please? Dang, where they at? It's taking forever. Hey, give me some forks. Does this look like a fork to you? Just stupid. Yo, Angela, you ain't gotta do the woman like that. You know she ain't all there. Shut up. - Girl... - Ooh! - Hey, babe. - Hey, babe. I hope y'all got that food going, 'cause I'm starvin'! Hey, little Cameron. How you doin'? Hi. You remember your uncle Chris, don't ya? Huh, it's okay. I don't come around the family as much as I'd like to. That's because my mama won't let you. Why don't you make yourself useful and go take care of that crying baby of yours? How about that? Cameron, your aunt and I, we got you a gift. Are you sure I can have it? Of course you can have it, because your auntie Mia is taking care of you now. - She's beautiful! - Just like you. I'm gonna call her Hannah, like the woman in the Bible. Mm! That's Nancy. She's the maid. You got a maid? Of course I do! All boss ladies do. What happened to your arm? She burned it on some hot grease cookin' chicken. Nancy, would you take Cameron to her room, please? Thank you. Down there? Yup! You'll be fine. It's okay. I don't like the dark. Can you turn on a light? I'm scared of the dark! Shut up! There's a window right there. No! No! - Shh! - No! No! No! No! - Cameron, stop! - No! No! No! - Sit down. - No! Cameron, stop! I said stop, girl! Stop! Let me go. What you lookin' at? Uncle Chris, please don't leave me here! Please! Please! I'm scared! Please don't leave me here! - Please, I'm scared! - Cameron... - Aunt Mia! - Cameron... It ain't no use in yellin' and screamin', baby. Nobody can hear you. Aunt Mia! Aunt Mia! Aunt Mia, I'm scared! Aunt Mia, please! Cameron... Believe me. It won't help. Come. It's okay. This is your home now. Come on out. - Is this the niece? - Her name is Cameron. Hi, Cameron. That's just Joanne and Harlen. They harmless. You don't have to worry about them. What you got there? Let her be. She's still in shock. Well, that's where you'll sleep. I made some chicken earlier. I put some to the side for you. You hungry? How come you ain't put nothin' to the side for me? Hush, she's... She's our guest. I'll get you something later. And no matter what, you never go behind here, okay? You understand? No matter what happens. Good. Now, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink the Kool-Aid they give you. They put something in it to make you sleepy. What should I drink, then? Anything else but that. Use the bathroom over there. It gets pretty cold down here at night, so I'ma let you use my blanket, but just for tonight. Don't get used to it. I don't wanna catch pneumonia. How long do you think I'll have to stay down here? Until Mia say it's enough. Our Father in the heavens, let Your name be sanctified. Let Your kingdom come. Let Your will take place as in Heaven, also on earth. Give us today our bread for this day, and forgive us our debts as we have also forgiven our debtors. But deliver us from the wicked one. In Jesus' name, amen. I've been calling y'all for almost a year about my daughter. And you have every right to voice your concern. We will do everything we can to establish communication with Ms. Smith. Has anyone gone to the house? We make periodic checks, yes. Liar! My sister stopped by and some Spanish people live there now. You guys are not doing your jobs. Look, you approved your daughter staying with Mia. Okay, wait a minute. Are you blaming my sister for this? Huh? How was I supposed to know she'd stop taking my calls? Listen, I'm not blaming anyone, okay? I-I'm simply saying we cannot be held accountable for something we didn't know. It's... It's been a year. And you're just now coming to us. I... If you had been doing your job, I wouldn't be needing to come to you now. I thought she was in good hands. I thought Mia had changed since she'd gotten out of jail. It's okay. Are you gonna help me get my child back or not? Um... Ms. Smith, I'm truly sorry for this... situation. I'll... I'll send the police to all the addresses that we have on file for Mia. While we do that, please continue to contact everyone that you know to see if you can find out anything, okay? And you report it to me. Here's, um... my direct number. Please call it at any time. Please help me find my baby. I'll do everything in my power. Get Thomas to sleep? Good luck with that. If you can get him down, I can take a long lunch, maybe head on over? Huh? Maybe I can handle a little bit of, uh, uh... Let me call you back. That's your easy file! Mia Smith, jailed for beating a man with a hammer, trapping him inside the closet, and starving him to death! You said you vetted her. You told me that you'd been to the house, Josh! I drove past it! Are you kidding me? Come on, you know we're swamped around here. It's impossible to handle all this casework. Now a little girl's life is at stake, and all you needed to do was type on your computer and pull up Mia's record. It took me all of, what? 15 minutes? - Okay, I'll stop by the house. - You damn right you will! 'Cause I'm not taking the fall for you on this one. So if you want your wife and child to have an employable father, you handle this. - Okay, okay... - Today! Okay! Yes, hi, I need the address of a Mia Smith? Mia Smith. You have my checks? - Angela. - Chris. Excuse me. Nancy still ain't get her disability check. You probably gonna have to take her down to the office. No, it's too risky. I'll figure something else out. In the meantime, I'll get her some work outside the house. Unless she knows more than one way to skin a cat. Okay, 'cause nobody gets a free ride living here. Chris stopped getting disability checks a year ago, right after he married you. He gettin' a free ride. You must have forgotten, I was the only one that hold your mama down when she was in jail. Trippin'. He did, I gotta give him that. I mean, we still getting checks from Nancy and Joanne's kids and the custody check from Cameron, so we're gonna be nice for a while. - Okay. - Smoke and relax. Ugh. It's some white man. I ain't expectin' nobody. What you want me to do? Get rid of him? Hi, uh, I'm Josh Goodman from the Department of Health Services. - Are you Mia Smith? - I am. Great, uh, I'm here to check up on your niece, Cameron Smith. - Uh, what about her? - Is she here? It's a man. He... He askin' about Cameron. No, she's at school. School? It's almost 5 o'clock. Yeah, she's in a after school program. - Dance. - Okay, okay. Well, uh, I can just come in and take a look around... Well, no. You know, the place is a mess and my niece isn't here. So why don't you try coming back tomorrow? Well, I could just... I could just do it right now. No, you probably should be goin' 'cause it gets dark pretty fast around here in the fall. And I don't think this is a place you wanna be when it gets dark. You're probably right. Um, I will come back tomorrow. First thing. - Please have your niece ready. - I will. Okay, thank you. - They gone! - What? How do you know? I saw them leaving last night. Are you sure? Yeah. They packed up their SUV and left. It was about 10 people. Whew! Nancy! Where you at? - Let me get that. - Here, babe. Get the rest of the bags out the car, and then take the diapers downstairs to Joanne, all right? Them kids costing me a fortune. Food better be ready, too. - 'Cause I'm starving! - Almost... Well, hurry up! Cameron! It's ready. Hey! Hey! What the... hell is wrong with you? Y'all two, stop runnin' in this house! The old lady down the street says she'll buy the extra television for $300. Fine, sell it to her. But we paid more for that when we bought it in Atlanta. Ma, you had it goin' on out there. Then you had to change it up bringin' Cameron into all this. It's the money that I'm getting from Cameron that takes care of you and your baby. Okay, so then let me take the other kids down to the office, get them signed up, so we can get some benefits or something. Are you crazy? What's the point of making Nan and Jo have these babies if we ain't cashin' in? If we take them kids down and put them in the system here, that's gonna lead everybody to us. Ain't no way the system in Tennessee is connected to the one in Atlanta. Yeah, well, I'm not about to find out. Come on, Ma! All I'm sayin' is we ain't been flossin' like how we used to since we left Atlanta. We gon' have to make some decisions about them kids soon. Like what? Maybe sell two of 'em. Get a little extra money. Don't nobody get a free ride. We gon' be all right. I got a little somethin' somethin' brewing. But Ma... I said I'm gonna take care of it! You right. Bingo. Who's that? Yeah, I've always loved kids. Especially when they ain't mine. I know that's right. So, how long have you been a nurse? Over 15 years. Wow. Ever deliver any kids? Ugh, I can do it with my eyes closed. Hold that thought. I'm allergic to a lot of things, so I need to keep these near me. Sorry to hear that. It's okay, I'm used to it. These keep the old ticker tickin'. Oh... Doesn't count. Divorced. Mm. So, where were we? Well, we were talkin' about you, your life and... Any family? War had big effects on me. Couldn't find a job to save my life. Funny how that goes. Became a burden to my family and friends, so no support there. But I get by pretty well with my disability checks. I bet you do. Yeah. Now all I need is a good-listening cutie like yourself to make my life better. Well... I can do you one better. I have a big house, and... I could use a hero like you to share it with. Interested? Trish? Hey, Trish, it's me! Trish? Okay. Trish? Trish? Oh my god. Trish. Trish, Trish. - Trish, wake up. - Cam? Cam? Oh, Cam, is that you, baby? No, no, it's me. It's Renee. Trish, I need you to wake up. Wake up. - Where's my baby? - I don't know. - Where's Cam? - Come here, come here. - Come here, come here. - Where's Cam? I don't know. I don't know. But it's okay. I'm here. I got you. My baby... I got you. It's okay, it's okay. I know, I know. I know. I know, I'm here. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. I brought you something. I made some for the family I keep house for. I knew today was your birthday. How? I saw it on some papers that Mia keeps upstairs. Make a wish. What did you wish for? What do you think? I've got a gift for you. When's the last time you was outside? I can't remember. Well, now you got a piece of the outside with you. I have God with me. I hear you every night sayin' the Lord's Prayer. And you keep that. You keep hope. That's all that's gonna see you through. Oh! I thought you said you lived here alone. Oh, he don't count. You know what? Maybe I should think about our moving in plan a little more and give you an answer when I'm sober. How about we meet up tomorrow? Well, I would love that. Um, but at least let me show you the best part of the house. It is where you and I... are gonna spend the majority of our time. I dare you to try to leave me. Then show me. Oh, I will. You won't be needing that, you know? Come on with your pretty self. This is exciting. Go on in. I'ma get the light. Okay. Hey. Hey. This isn't funny. Open the door. Let me out. Please, please open the door! Ain't gonna help. Might as well get used to it. What the hell are you talking about? She can't just leave us here. We've been stuck in the basement I don't know how long. Well, when she opens the door, we need to work together... Don't you think we've tried that already? All we got was a hot spoon to the skin and a beatin'. She ain't never gonna let you go. How old are you? 16. This is Cameron. I'm Nancy. He's Harlen, and she's Joanne. - How far along are you? - Eight months. Great, so when you go to the hospital, you need to tell them about everything that's... There ain't no hospital. Jo gonna have the baby right here just like all of us. What others? How many children are there? Between me and Jo? Four. We need to get her to a hospital. We ain't goin' nowhere. Hey, uh, clean the blood up off the floor. If we don't, she could bleed out! Bitch, I said we're not leaving. Now just help with the baby. Push, Jo! Push! There you go, that's it. It's coming! Wait... It's not breathing. Why isn't it breathing? My god, what's happening? What's happening? Again? What the hell's wrong with you, pushing out all these dead babies? What kind of monster are you? She just lost her child! Bitch, you need to stay out of business that don't concern you. Uh, bury it outside. I think the shovel is over there next to the... Where do you think you're goin'? Grab her, Ang! Grab her, Ang! I'm so sorry, Jo. I'ma keep you in my prayers. If you really wanna help her, we have to get out of here. The last time we tried to escape... I don't care if it didn't work. Look at Joanne. No one should live like this. Oh, we have... to keep trying... Help! Somebody help! Help! It's okay, just... just breathe. Help! Help! Somebody help! Give me my stick. Help! Just what the hell is goin' on down here? We have to get her to a doctor. I need to keep these near me. She don't need no damn doctor. She just need them pills. Cameron, go to my medicine cabinet and give me the brown bottle. Hurry up. Nancy, you just gonna sit there or are you gonna do somethin'? What? I don't know, CPR or something. I don't know how! I can't breathe. Shut up! Don't give them to me, stupid. Give them to her. What's happening? Oh, this bad. What did you do? I-I didn't do anything. No, this is all your fault. No... Yeah, the police are gonna make you pay for this. No! They gonna give you the chair for killing this white woman. - Help me. - Shut up. Please help me... I said shut up and don't touch me! Now look at me. Now, I'm gonna help you. But you remember that at any given moment, I can tell the police what you did. And they will fry you. So you remember where your loyalties lie. No, no, no, no, no, no. Mia, what are we gonna do now? Hide it where you hid all the other bodies. Mia, this different. That's a white woman. And you know them people gonna come lookin' for her. Then I guess you need to hide the body real good, then. Damn! Hey, Harlen, go get the tools, man. Hurry up! I'm only gonna say this once. It's not your fault. But Mia said... To hell with Mia. I need you to know that it's not your fault. No matter what happens, okay? Cameron! Get up and go clean the kitchen! He be actin' a fool! A straight fool. I love me some Will Smith, though. Hey, y'all better stop running through this house. Oof, girl! You stink. I bet you haven't showered in, like, what? A month? You are one ugly girl. You know that? But I guess it's... genetic. Ugly mother. Ugly daughter. Super funny. He be actin' a fool! I love me some Will Smith, though, babe. I know, I know, I know. I know they ain't broke nothin'. Go get them kids! Can't even watch my show! Can't even watch my show... Yeah, that's right. You done with them dishes yet? Yeah. Good. Take out the trash. I'll put the food away. Okay. God... I know that you're everywhere, so I know that you can hear me. Please... help me. Hey Mia, this girl out here talkin' to trees. What she sayin'? How the hell would I know? Look like she praying or something. I don't know why. It ain't helped her yet. Cameron's smart. She ain't like the other ones. Fool! Please, okay? She ain't even gone to school. You ain't gotta go to school to be smart, and you know that. She quiet. She observes. She different. And most important, she ain't afraid of you. Chris, what you even talkin' about? I so much as say "boo," that girl be cryin' for her mama. Listen, I know she knows that you call the shots, aight? But deep down, she know there is somebody out there lookin' for her. Somebody who cares about her. And sometimes that's all the hope you need to keep goin'. Mark my word, the first chance she gets, that girl gonna try to run away from here. I'm tellin' you. Kitchen is done. Good. Get back to the basement. Can't sleep either? I used to do that. Look outside and wonder if I'd ever get a chance to be out there without Mia on my back. I feel like you know so much about me. I never even asked how you met Mia. How any of y'all met her. Joanne ran away from home, and she was lookin' for a mother figure. She thought she was gettin' that from Mia. Harlen, he was... lookin' for somebody to love him, treat him like a man. She told him that she loved him, and he believed her. And you? I was just lookin' for money to get high. And Mia offered me that too. She'll become whatever you need her to be to reel you in. And once you fall for it, she closes the basement door in your face. I'm not on drugs anymore, so there's that. But you? You keep lookin' outside. You don't let these four walls determine how your life gon' turn out. Okay? Excuse me, ma'am? Can I carry your bag for some spare change? Excuse me? Ma'am? Hey. Look, I-I know you see a homeless drunk man, but... I served the country. Even went overseas. Did you, now? - Yes, ma'am. - Hm. Even saw some action. Okay, which war? Iraq? When did you serve? Ah, it's been a... Now, you see that? If it's one thing I can't stand, it's a liar. If you wanted some money to get you a drink, all you had to do was ask. Yes, ma'am. 'Cause you know even I like a good drink. You really didn't have to come up with this fantasy. I apologize. No worries. Oh... If you lookin' for a job, I have one. Comes with a place to stay and food to eat. And alcohol. Sounds like my kind of work. I just have one rule... When I tell you to do something, you do it. No questions asked. Are we clear? You pay me, you tell me to jump, I won't even ask how high. Good. You can start tonight. - Get in. - Yes, ma'am. So, what's your name? Travis, but everyone calls me Pastor. Pastor? Why? Right here. Thank the Lord. Want some? No, I don't know where your lips been. So these them, huh? Mm-hmm. The hotel behind the liquor store. What about buddy? No. But these other three, they can work. Please, Mia, not Cam. She just 16. She's old enough. She gonna have to learn about it someday. Wait, what? Even her? Yeah, even her. I heard that men like women that's already knocked up. Nancy? What? What's gonna happen at the motel tomorrow? Cam, you, um, remember those Bible verses you used to say when you first got here? The ones I said got on my nerves? Yeah. They didn't. They actually... calmed me in a weird way. Tomorrow... when Pastor takes us to that motel, I want you to say those verses to yourself, you hear? Just keep sayin' them over and over until it stops. Okay. Cam, I know you lost a lot of faith when that lady died down here, but... but I think it jumped on me. I'm gonna get us out of here. All of us. Just hold on, okay? Hold on. I been waiting all day for this. Our father in the heavens, let Your name be sanctified. Let Your kingdom come. Let Your word take place as in Heaven, also on earth. She all we got left. Take her or leave her. No, no, no, no, no, no. Relax. You're a nice girl. You want candy? I have candy. And the United States have little reason to fear importing inflation from overseas. The European Central Bank on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged, resisting pressure to join other major central banks and help stimulate the... How we do? $790. There's plenty more where that came from. That place is full of Johns around the clock. Go on, put them in the shower, and then give 'em some leftovers out the refrigerator. You heard her! What you waitin' for? Go! Move it! It's coming? Breathe, breathe. Mia! What are you yelling about? It's Joanne! What's wrong with Joanne? She's having the baby! Okay, well, come on. Push it out. Push it out. Go on and push. You can do it. You got it. Cameron, please go get some towels. You can do it, okay? You got yourself a beautiful baby girl. Yes, I do have myself a beautiful baby girl. I'm gonna call her Baby Mia. Yes, baby. Yes... What... Oh, ! Pay me! Good play, good play. Baby, please shut that baby up. Okay, put a little powder in the bottle and give it to her, make her ass go to sleep. All right. As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, we've been gone long enough. Cam's 17 now, practically an adult. Her mama probably not even lookin' for her no more. I just don't get why we can't go back to Atlanta. She was just a little hungry. But, but look, Angela, ain't nobody trying to go back down to Atlanta, all right? I'm trying to go back down to Atlanta. I ain't never been to Atlanta. And ain't nobody askin' you to go either. Exactly. Well, if I were to go, and I'm not sayin' that I am, Pastor would come with us. He done earned his spot in the family. Well, I'm tired of the people, and I'm tired of smelling like cows! We not flossin' down here... like we used to in Atlanta. I'm so tired of hearing you say that. Ain't nobody keeping you here. So you sayin' I can leave? If I was forcin' you to stay, you'd be locked in the basement... Girl, she playing with you! All I'm sayin', if you wanna go, you can go on and go. Hell, that's two less mouths to feed. Now, I know that's right. But I'm gonna need you to take Joanne's kids with you, 'cause I'mma give Pastor the room. And you see if you can get they benefits started up again down in Atlanta. Sit down. I'm sending two kids up there with you. And it better be two when Pastor comes to check things out. Okay, where were we? I smell some money. You about to give me 20 points. Game, pow! She's taking my kids. She's taking my kids. - She's taking my kids. - What are you talking about? Angela's moving back, and she's taking my kids with her! What about the baby? I don't know! I don't know what she's gonna do. Lookin' at those trees ain't gonna help. I know you think God is everywhere, but he ain't, 'cause if he was, he wouldn't keep letting all this bad stuff happen to us. It is not God that lets bad things happen to people. But he ain't savin' us from it, either. You think God gonna let me hold my babies again? I hope so. I can watch baby Mia in the kitchen. If you want. No, not in the kitchen. That's too dangerous in there. Uh, you can take her to the basement, all right? I'ma go handle some business. Oh! Oh, she look like my mama. She's beautiful. I know Mia call her Baby Mia, but that's not her name. That's not your name! It's Marie. That's my mama name. What's your mama name? Cathy. I used to think she was so strict, but now I know she just loved me. What about your mother? Ruth. She died when I was a little girl. I don't remember much about her. Been alone ever since. My mother's name is Patricia. She's the prettiest lady you'd ever see. She's funny, too. She looked out for me back then. My other mother's name is Nancy. She's brave and strong... She's the mother who takes care of me now. She take care of all of us. Do you want a piece? It's your favorite. Thank you. You a police officer, right? I saw your badge the first time we met. Surprised? Nothing surprises me anymore. My mama said that, when you in trouble, you should always call the police. Your mama was right. Well, I'm in trouble. How much for all night? How long has she had you in that basement? Over 10 years. Damn. We're gonna do somethin' about it. Thank you so much, Officer. I tell you, this woman is evil. You have no idea the kind of stuff she does. She... She won't even feed us, you know? Like, This is nothin'. Those other girls you saw, they're... They're in the basement too. Where... Where are you going? You said we was goin' to the police station. We, we back in my neighborhood. No, this is... This is the wrong way! No! You said you would take me and help me! No, please! Get up! Please don't leave me back here! - Shut up! - Please don't... You the police! You supposed to help me! You said your system was tight. It is. Trust it'll never happen again. I'm not takin' you at your word. Prove it. Chris, go get the others. Okay. Y'all need to see. This is what happens when you try to leave this house. Or talk about what goes on in this house. Let me tell you something. I know everything. I'm everywhere. I'm god in this house! Pastor... Get your ass up! Get your ass up! Put her in the attic. Take off her damn clothes. I don't want to waste no good dress on no beat-up bitch. Does our word mean something now? Yeah. I'm convinced. Run the damn ball, boy! I'm gonna go ahead on and head out to the store. I'll be back in about an hour. All right, baby. Be careful. Hey, man. Sassy little bitch. Hey, bring me a beer! And hurry up. I said hurry up! Nancy... My god, it's so hot in here. Nancy... Here. C-Cam... Don't come back. I'll see you tomorrow. We good to go for tonight. What's the 411 on Nancy? You got the policeman and about five other men askin' about her. You're missin' out on a whole lot of money. I guess she been up there long enough. Cameron? Go on up there and help Nancy get cleaned up and ready for work. Nancy, they're letting you... Nancy? No... No... Nancy! Nancy, please! No, no, no, no! Nancy, wake up! Wake up, please! No! No, Nancy, please! Damn. Please, Nancy, no! No! What the hell are you yelling about? Nancy! She won't wake up! Girl, shut up! What we gonna do? That policeman ain't gonna save us now. - Okay... - You need to fix this! Everybody shut up! Uh uh, I ain't signed up for any of this. - Hell no! - Pastor! You said that when I tell you to jump, you weren't gonna ask me how high. That's what you told me. So don't start askin' now. Now, get the others, pack up the whole house. We gotta go. Fix this, babe. I got it. Get your ass up and come on. What about Nancy? What about her? I said get downstairs and pack. Don't make me ask you again. Now! Okay, come on, y'all. Chris, grab my good pillows over there, baby. Don't drop that VCR. Go on, take it over there. Pastor, come on with the baby's toys! It don't take that long! Cameron! Hurry up! And don't break my damn computer! Come on, baby, grab these clothes. Come on, here we go. Pastor, come on, now, come on! Cameron, be gentle with that. You break that computer, I'ma break your ass. Come on, y'all. Here we go. Hey, take those bags upstairs for me. Ma, let me show you the basement. It ain't really much of a basement. And the manager's strict. Don't want anything down here, not even no animals. So they can't stay long. Yeah, well, we'll be out of your hair once we find a place of our own. There's not enough space down here for all of us. Don't worry. I got the perfect spot for you. Get in. No, please. Girl, get in before I get my BB gun. Why are you doing this? Because you weak. You don't even know what it takes to survive. And you do? In this life, you either taken from somebody or they taken from you. I do what I gotta do to make it. I held this family down when your grandma died! And what thanks do I get? Nothing. The disrespect. Through all the beatings, the rape, the jail time... I was always there for the family. But it wasn't enough. So forget them. But your ass is weak. And I'ma make it strong like me. Like you? I'll never be like you! No! No, please! Aunt Mia, please! Auntie Mia! Please, Auntie Mia, don't... Auntie Mia, let me out! You gettin' a little too comfortable in here. We're family now. Dang, Ma! Elijah is upstairs sleeping. Can't you take that outside? Girl, shut up. Don't tell me what to do. Good riddance. Any luck? No. Nothing with a basement big enough. Yeah, and that basement is too small. It stinks to high hell. Neighbors gonna cause a fuss one of these days. Don't you think I know that? What we can do is probably air the basement out and even let them get some air. Maybe that could buy us some time. What about your niece? Man, it gotta be 100 degrees in there. She ain't had no food or water in three days. It's almost like you're trying to kill the girl. Our Father in the heavens, let Your name be sanctified. Let Your Kingdom come. Let Your will take place as in Heaven, on earth. Am I dead? All right, thank you for this. And, uh... it will clear this time? Yes. All right, well, thank you very much. Take care. Oh, you know, one more thing? We got some complaints from the neighbors about some of the smells around here. I want to make sure there's no pets, no dogs, no nothin', right? I know the rules. We don't have any pets. - All right. Take care. - You too. All right. Oh, god! Oh! What? Ugh, I knew it. Come on out! Come on out! Come on out! Oh my god... 911, what's your emergency? - Police! - Police! Clear? Hey! Hey! Hey! What the hell are you doing? You can't go in when you don't have a warrant! Get off of me! You're hurting me! Police! Get down, ma'am! Get down! Hey, get your hands off of her, man! Calm down! Calm down! No! Don't touch her! Stop touching her like that! Stay calm. Oh my god. We found her. Hey, it's okay, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. I promise. Come on. You got it. You're fine. I got you. It's all right. Here we go. What's your name, hon? I want my mom. We'll call your mom, don't worry. Thank you. Let's go. Cleared out. Our Father in the heavens, let Your name be sanctified. Let Your kingdom come... Let Your will take place as in Heaven, also on earth. Mama? Next on the docket, we have Mrs. Mia Smith. For the record, please state your name. Mia Smith. At this time, you may explain to the board why you're suitable for early parole. I didn't have a easy life. I was abused by my own mother and by others in my family. I did what I... could do to survive. Yeah, I did wrong. But I learned my lesson. I got help. And now I know that I hurt a lot of people. I'm sorry. And I know that if you give me another chance, I can be a productive member of society. Thank you for listening to my petition. Thank you, Ms. Smith. If there's anyone else who wishes to speak, you may do so now. Thank you. For the record, your name is? Cameron Smith. Thank you, Miss Smith. What would you like to say? You once told me that you held down the family after Grandma died. But you don't know what family means. Family looks out for each other. They care for each other. Family doesn't hurt each other. They don't... hold each other captive, rape, torture, or force each other into sexual acts with strangers. You said you did those things to me to make me strong. Well, I'm stronger than you. And I won't hurt others the way that you hurt me. You're evil. And you don't deserve to be free. Thank you. Thank you.
