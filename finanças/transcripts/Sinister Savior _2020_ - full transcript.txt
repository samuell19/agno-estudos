There’s only one person that we can never escape, and that’s ourselves. And we gotta... We have to love ourselves, right? There’s no reason to hold on to all that guilt, no matter how massive it is. Now, it’s always important for us to recognize when someone isn’t afraid to do the work. Someone who isn’t afraid to face the problem head on. Karen... let’s give her a hand. Nine months sober. We are so proud of you. Come get this, girl. You deserve it. Are you sure? Yeah, I don’t know. Okay. Excuse me, Karen. Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you. Um, it’s all good. I’m just in my own little world over here. I noticed. Who are you texting? Um, my best friend, actually. You wanna grab a cup of coffee? - I, I have a coffee. ! Right. How about dinner? Um, you know, Jimmy, I’m-I’m not really trying to see anyone right now. -What do you mean? -Well, I just mean, my... My divorce is just finalized, and I’m, I’m really trying to focus on myself, is all. Just dinner. I’m not asking you to marry me. -I’m sorry if I misinterpreted. -It’s all right. I get it. Whatever. Really? -Thanks for having us. -I’ll see you next week, right? -Absolutely. -Okay, you be here. -Thanks for having us. -Okay, bye. -Bye-bye. -Bye. Bye. -You outta here, hon? -Yeah. -Yeah? Okay. -Yeah, yeah. Um, so I have a meeting with the lawyers again next week. - About the house or what? - Yeah. The-the medical license, it’s a whole other story, so... Listen, remember what I said, okay? One step at a time. -Did you hear from Steven today? -No. Does that make you sad? Um, I guess I feel like I don’t really have the right to feel that way, you know. Listen, my third divorce... it was messier than my first two put together. But you’re a good egg, baby. Don’t let anybody convince you otherwise. Thank you for everything. I’ll see you Thursday. -Yes, you will. Okay. -Okay. -Bye, hon. Bye. -Bye now. Are you walking? Yeah. Yeah. - I can give you a lift. - No. I like the walk, it helps me clear my head. -Okay. If you’re sure. -Yeah. It’s so close, it’s just up over the hill on Franklin, a few blocks. Well, there’s a lot of creeps between here and Franklin. Yeah, I know. But, um, I think they’re harmless. - Not as bad as Steven, right? - Exactly. All right, be safe. -Okay. You, too. -See you next week. -Yeah. Bye. -Bye. I got you now. Somebody! Help! Please! Somebody! -Come here! -Okay. Okay, okay. Help! Somebody. Okay, okay, okay. Stop, stop screaming. Shut your mouth or I’ll cut you right now. Get outta here! Get... Go on, get outta here! Hey, you all right? -Are you hurt? -No. Thanks. God, your arm is... No, I don’t think it’s deep. Um, I’m gonna call 911. Wait, wait. Sorry, could you not? -Why? -Well, unless you’re hurt. I think I’m okay. I just don’t want to involve the police. I just... I just started this new job. And I-I don’t have insurance right now. To tell you the truth, I... I’ve got a record. It’s just, you know, a drug charge. But... I mean, you know how cops can be. Right? Sometimes, people see you for who you used to be. You know. I’m Daniel, by the way. Um... I’m Karen. Thank you for your help. -Let me see your arm. -No, it’s okay. Really. Let me see. Let me see. It might need a few stitches. Um, when’s the last time you had a tetanus shot? Sometime last year, I think. But I’ll figure it out. Really. Thank you. - You can make it home okay? - Yeah. I’m, I’m-I’m just up the street. But I-I could take you to the hospital. -I’d be happy to. -I’m good. - But your arm is so bad. - No buts! Okay? You don’t owe me anything. All right? I was just at the right place at the right time. That’s all. If you say so. Well, good night then. Good night. Daniel, wait. I’m, I’m an ER doctor. Or I used to be. -But I-I need to-- -You used to be? It’s a long story. Yes. But I’m not gonna let you just walk home like this after what you did for me tonight. But I told you, you don’t owe me-- No buts. Okay? Now you need to let me take a closer look at the cut in the light. Okay. Um, it’s this way. This way. It’s just up and around the corner. -So, it’s not far. -All right. - Nice night? - Well, it’s lovely. - This is quite a place. - Thanks. But I don’t really plan on sticking around much longer. Listen, I, I don’t wanna impose. Okay, seriously, I’m fine. I don’t really think you’re in the position to judge that right now. I’ve been through worse. Trust me. Okay. Well, I’m gonna do my best to treat your injuries here. But you have to promise to let me take you to the hospital if I think it’s necessary. Same hospital where you were an ER doc? No. No. Definitely not that hospital. Um... You know, what you said just about people judging you for who you used to be. I know what that’s like. Hey, Karen! I thought I heard you. Sorry. I just wanted to check with you and... I’m so sorry. I did not see that you had company. Hey, Rhonnie. Yeah, no, we’re just, um-- My God! What happened? Um, I was actually attacked this evening. Attacked? By who? It looked like a homeless person. But then this Good Samaritan jumped in and-and helped me out, and was cut in the process. Well, don’t let me stop you from administering a little first aid to your handsome hero? I’ll see you tomorrow. Sure thing. Now that’s how you do a rebound. - Sorry about that. - It’s fine. You live in this big place all alone? I shared it with my husband. Ex-husband. - Well, it’s tasteful. - Thanks. Wow. -It’s nice. -Thank you. Could I please wash my hands? Yes, of course. Um, bathroom. -Just right around here. -Great. Thanks. There’s, um, antibacterial soap under the sink if you wanna just make sure you washed that cut out really well. Please. Yes, doctor. I’m sorry. It’s kind of a mess in there. You should see my place. Just wasn’t really expecting company. God! -You okay? -Yeah. I guess I’m just still a little jumpy. It’s understandable. Let me see your cut. It’s not as bad as I thought it was. -You’re lucky. -Yeah, I sure am. I think a couple of these butterfly bandages will just do it. Would you step into my operating room? Okay. So, where do you live, Daniel? Close by. Yeah. Over on Fountain and La Brea. I was actually on my way home when I saw you. And how long have you been in the neighborhood? Not long. Just over a year. Yeah, I-I moved here to work for my uncle. -Doing what? -Commercial real estate. Yeah, I was actually scoping out a couple of properties in the area. I was, supposed to do it earlier, but... - It’s all good. - Sorry. I guess I’m not that tough after all. You’re fine. Gonna wash my hands. So, where were you living before? Colorado. Boulder, to be exact. Nice. And what were you doing there, real estate? I was a rock climbing instructor and, mountain guide. That sounds pretty adventurous. Yeah, it was. Just didn’t quite pay the bills. You know. My best friend, Izzie, goes rock-climbing with her kids and her husband. Members at one of those rock gyms. And you used to be an ER doc. I’m on a leave of absence. But it’s not a voluntary one. Well, I would love to hear that long story. It’s not really a crowd pleaser. It’s kind of sad and pathetic, actually. I’ve got a feeling there’s nothing sad and pathetic about you. It’s probably gonna leave a scar. Yeah, and my own long story to go along with it. It is certainly a doozy. I’m anxious to see how it ends. Did you want some water? Sure. Yeah, I’m parched. Shock and acute anxiety will do that for you. Thank you. So, is this the first time you’ve-you’ve rescued a damsel in distress? Or are you out conquering arch enemies in the night? -You are teasing me. -No. No, you actually really seemed like you knew what you were doing. I had no idea what I was doing. I’ve never actually been in a real fight before. But I am an Aries. And that has something to do with the warrior spirit. From what little I know about the zodiac. I’m an Aries. When’s your birthday? -March 30th. -No! -What? -That’s my birthday! -Seriously? -Yes! -No. -Yeah. -Okay, that is too weird. -It’s really weird. It’s very weird. Well, I would say that we are even now, fellow warrior. - I’d better run. - Yeah. Thank you. -Ooh! -Whoa. It’s all right. Dizzy spell. Um, you don’t really look like you should be running anywhere. -W-why don’t you sit back down? -Yeah. Maybe I took one to the head a little harder than I thought. Hold still. Why don’t you look at me? Um... Yeah, you might have a mild concussion. I, I think you should stick around so we can monitor you. And if your symptoms get worse, you’re going to the hospital whether you want to or not. -Well, if you insist. -I would feel better about it. -Okay. -Here, let me take this. -I’m sorry. -You’re fine. -You good? Okay. -Yeah. Why don’t you just sit right here? - Here we go. - Thank you. Um, I’m gonna go and I’m gonna get you that shirt. Okay. Thanks. - Here you go. - Thank you. Um, will you be okay if I just take a few minutes and go get cleaned up? -Sure thing. Yeah. -Okay. -Hey, Izzie. -Bye, you guys. Have fun! Hey, Karen. Where have you been? I’ve been calling you for an hour. Gosh, sorry. Um, look, I’m okay. But I just wanna let you know I was on my way home from my meeting and there was a guy jumped out and attacked me. A-attacked? As in physically attacked you? Yes. But like I said, I’m fine. There was this other gentleman, this Good Samaritan who kinda came out of nowhere and-and helped me out, so... I’ve told you a hundred times not to walk home from the community center. I mean, if-if you don’t wanna drive, call me or take a Rideshare. You know, I’ve actually had my fair share of freaky Rideshares, too. You’re just a magnet for trouble, aren’t you? Well, what about this other guy? The-the guy who helped you? Um... Just hang on. He is fine, um, seems like he’s got a few minor cuts and contusions, but he’s okay. He’s in the other room. What... He’s-he’s there? He’s there with you now in your house? Yeah, Izzie, he is, because he just saved me from being robbed or who knows what. And I’m not gonna just send him out into the world concussed and bleeding. Karen, judgement. I mean... You know, I-I really think you can give me some credit here. -Is Rhonnie there? -Yeah. I actually ran into her on my way inside. Okay, good. Call her now. Have her come back, so you’re not alone with this guy. -I’m not gonna bug Rhonnie. -Then I’m coming over. Izzie, what’s the matter with you, why are you freaking out about this? It’s not that big of a-- I’m not freaking out, okay? Just-just sit tight. Jerry and the girls, they just left for the airport. They’re getting right out of New York, I can be there in less than 30 minutes. No, Izzie, Izzie... Hello there. Hello. How’s the patient? I’m fine. Thank you. - Where’s Karen? - She’s getting cleaned up. Gotcha. Karen’s friend buzzed me, asked me to come by and check on her, so... She’s getting cleaned up, as I said. Well, I, I really appreciate you being a hero to my friend like that. She’s been through enough this year. Yes, I’ve-I’ve gathered. - So are you gonna invite me in? - I can’t really do that. Can I? It’s not my house. Okay. -Hey. -Hey. Who was at the door? Just some religious nut. Yeah. I hope you don’t mind that I answered it. Really? Seems kinda late. Yeah, they get more persistent all the time. Convince we’re all lost souls that need saving. Lost souls. So, what’s going on with the butterfly? It doesn’t seem to be sticking. Why don’t you let me take a look at it? -Let’s go in here. I’ll fix it. -Okay. Sure. Same phone. It looks like we’ve got the same phone, too. Twins. You know, this is so strange. This brand is usually really good. The adhesive must be faulty. So, that is quite a scar on your stomach. Yeah. I really did a number on it in a bar fight. In a bar fight? I don’t know, you just said that you had never been in a real fight before. Yeah... That wasn’t a real fight. It happened when I was bartending. You know, some guys started fighting. And you know, I had to break it up before they destroyed the place. Well, unfortunately, one of them, stabbed me in the process accidentally. - Accidentally? - Yeah... I got right in the middle when one of them pulled a knife. So... Yeah. Well, your surgeon certainly stitched you up nicely. And that kinda sounds like a real fight to me. I wouldn’t count breaking up a fight as being in a fight. It’s still pretty intense. At moments like these, I could really use a drink. Yeah. I... - I would offer. But I just-- - No, it’s okay. I’m sober now, too. Two years now. Yeah. Going strong. -Today is my nine months. -Congrats. - That’s, that’s amazing. - Thanks. Yeah, I was in a pretty dark place there for a while. Just... did a lot of things I regret. And... alienated a lot of people. But I’m moving forward and focusing on just my health and my career and relationships. Husband? How did you... You-you mentioned your ex-husband earlier. - Just... Yeah. - That’s right. Yeah. Yeah, that ship has sailed, but that’s okay. Yeah, I’m just all on my own now and I’ve accepted it. Well, that is powerful. Strong. I think if I was strong I wouldn’t be in this position. That is not true. Besides, in our moments of weakness... we have to lean on each other. And I’m grateful for the chance to have been there for you tonight. Excuse me a moment. Hello. Hey. It’s me, Jimmy. Hey, Jimmy. What’s up? It’s late. I know, I’m sorry... I was just, thinking about you and I, I thought I would, I would call, you know. - Jimmy, where are you? - No place... No place special. I was just thinking that... I wanted to apologize for, you know, what happened after the meeting. And-and that wasn’t right. And, you know... I had no right to act like that. You’re such an inspiring person, Karen. I’m just garbage. You’re-you’re not garbage, Jimmy. Have you called your sponsor? Ted? Man, Ted’s a hypocrite. Besides, you’re, you’re, you’re much more helpful than he is. Jimmy, wherever you are, you need to get a ride home. Sounds like you actually care about me. Do you, do you care about me? Yeah... Yeah, of course. Of course, I do. I mean... would you care if something bad happened to me? Ye... Yeah. W-what do you mean something bad? Care, pity. Same difference, right? Come on, Jimmy. Look, I-I gotta go, Karen. Okay, promise me that wherever you are you’re gonna get a ride home. Yeah, I’m sorry for bugging you. -Bye, Karen. -Jimmy. Jim... - God! - Whoa. It’s just me. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, I don’t, um, maybe I don’t know, but I... Yeah, I couldn’t help over hearing. It sounded like a tough conversation. He’s a friend of yours? Yeah, just a friend reaching out for help. Well, it seems like we’re both destined to be saviors tonight. Just don’t think, I was very effective. There you go, not giving yourself enough credit. Hey, you shouldn’t do that. I bet you’ve helped a lot of people, haven’t you? I’ve tried. I think you’ve done more than that. I just hope the people that you’ve helped... understand and appreciate just how important that you are. And I know I would. What are you doing? Come here. What’s wrong? I just think this is a bit... Popular lady. I almost forgot about Izzie. Izzie? It’s just, she’s my friend. Excuse me. What happened with the sick rapist freak? - God. - Come here. He, he took off. Um, Izzie, this is Daniel. Daniel, Izzie. You didn’t even call the cops? Well, I think we were both in shock. Yeah. -I was injured, so... -Yeah, I can see that. Yeah, by the time we came to our senses, he was long gone. Yeah, you know, you really didn’t have to come over here. - There’s no reason to worry. - It’s no big deal. Jerry took the girls out of town this weekend, and the house is a little too quiet for my taste. And if there’s anything you’ve given me over the years, it is reason to worry. And as smart as my best friend is, she hasn’t always shown the best judgment. Maybe you should give her a break. You know, she’s been through a lot. Yeah, could’ve been a lot worse, apparently, if it weren’t for you. Could have been. So, Daniel, what is it that you do? I am in commercial real estate. Yeah, you know, fortunately for me, Daniel was here in the area checking out some local listings late. Very late, apparently. And he was also a rock-climbing instructor, and I told him how you and Jerry and the kids... You’re really into that. Did you work at a local gym or... I was actually guiding in Utah. I thought it was Colorado. It was. Um, before, I was in Utah, Moab. I was bouncing back and forth a bit. We actually took a family vacation in Moab. It’s a beautiful place. What were some of your favorite spots? I-I don’t know, really. God, there are so many. Come on, you have to have one. I mean... If you worked there and everything. Owl Rock, maybe. -Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah, we went there. - Who’s that? - God, it’s... I gotta take this, I’m sorry. But, um, you guys talk and just be good, please. Okay. So, Daniel... just you and me, Just me and you. Hey, Jimmy. Where are you? Can you please tell me you’re not driving right now? I’m not. I was, but... I’m not now. I’m so sick of myself. I, I can’t... I can’t keep doing this. You can’t keep doing what, Jimmy? I just want it to stop. I just want it to stop. You can stop. I promise you, you can. Cut the group crap, Karen. This, this just has to end. I want it to end, right now. Still can’t believe that coincidence. - What? - I mean... That you just happened to be right there when Karen got attacked. You know, no one else around. Just... you. Are you trying to say that it wasn’t a coincidence? You know, maybe you’re right. Maybe it was destiny. So, where are you from, Daniel? All over the world, really. California, Germany, Guam, as a military grad. And what do you like to do for fun? I mean, when you’re not rescuing damsels in distress. I don’t really have many hobbies these days. I’ve become a very focused individual, driven. Hey, what do you do? I mean, besides babysitting your little friend. Well, as smart a Karen is, she’s always been too trusting. You know, that’s part of what’s gotten her in the most trouble. That and the fact that she nearly worked herself to death. Well, let’s say we keep this about you. Fair enough. So, the real estate’s pretty tough in this area? -Well, I’ve been doing okay. -Yeah? Do you have a website? I’d love to check it out. Yeah, it’s down for maintenance. So, here’s a coincidence. I work in real estate, too. I wasn’t familiar with any commercial listings in this area. Well, I do commercial in private. So, what properties where you looking at? Names? Or addresses, I might know of them. Well, I don’t remember the exact addresses. Is that your briefcase? Maybe you could check. Well, you’re gonna think I’m a creep no matter what I say. ’Cause you’ve already decided. Maybe, or maybe you can give me the name of just one of your many listings and that’ll satisfy the babysitter. Yeah, just as I thought. I told you. I don’t remember the addresses. And I told you I’m a real estate agent. But then again... Maybe I’m not. I find the way that you’re treating me to be very... ungrateful. Do you? I don’t like people who are ungrateful. Okay, Jimmy, look, I-I need you to tell me where you are. I’m serious. It doesn’t matter. Jimmy, I want to help you, I want to send someone to you, but I’ve gotta know where you’re at. Look, I, I-I didn’t mean to upset you. I-I’m sorry. I’m not. You didn’t upset me, but I would like to know that you’re not gonna do anything crazy right now. Bye, Karen. Tsk. Where’s Izzie? She just left. Yeah. She seemed a little, um... I don’t know, impatient. Her car’s there. Well, maybe, she went across the street to visit, what’s her name, Rhonnie. She didn’t say anything? Not really. No. Yeah, I get the sense that she doesn’t like me very much, for some reason. Does she always treat you that way? No, she’s just protective. So am I. Hey. Where’d you go? Call me. Tsk! What’s going on? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I think. It’s just another one of those dizzy spells. Um, maybe you should sit down. Honestly, I think we should think about taking you to the hospital. Head injuries just aren’t something to mess with. No. No, no, no. It’s fine. It’s fine, um... Could I, could I just use your bathroom, please? -Yeah, sure. -Okay. Thanks. Hey, um... Why don’t you use my bathroom? It’s just down the hall. It’s just nicer. Okay. Thanks. Why are you so sad, Karen? Hey. Looks like we’ve had a little mix-up. Twins, remember? Why is there a picture of my house on your phone? Are there? I don’t know, I’ve taken a lot of photos around the neighborhood. Real estate, remember? Besides, is it really so crazy that I might have a random picture of you? We’re obviously connected. You can appreciate that. Can’t you? Yeah. Yeah, I can. You might not even be alive now if it wasn’t for me. I know that. Your best friend says that you’re trusting. Can’t you trust your own savior? Yeah. Good. Now, can I have my phone back? And what about my phone? You’re a popular lady indeed. Aren’t you gonna see who it is? -Jimmy! -Hello. Now, I-I-I-I know... I know I shouldn’t be here. I have no right, but... I just felt like I should come over. I’m really glad you’re here. - You are? - You know... I just was really worried about you. You-you-you have, you have company. What can we do to help you, Jimmy? I was, um... I was having a bad night and I, um... I was hoping to talk to Karen, is all. Well, you’ve already talked to her tonight, haven’t you? Yeah. Well, it’s a little disrespectful to just show up like this, isn’t it, Jimmy? - I’m sorry. - Yeah. Hey, y’all having a party or what? Nobody invited me. It’s not a party. Well, it looks like Izzie made it by. Her car’s in the driveway. Okay, well... have her stop by before she leaves. I’ll be up. Everything okay, Karen? Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine. Okay. Okay. Can I use your bathroom? You take care now, Jimmy. Okay, okay. I’m thinking, I shouldn’t be driving. Well, you made it over here, didn’t you? Yeah. Okay. I’m... I’m sorry. Just... Jimmy! You know, I... I just want you to remember what Anne said, you know, at the meeting, ’cause... It’s okay to realize you have a problem. But, um... you, I need you to please... please get help. Please? Okay. I’m sorry. No, please, please. Please! Where’s Izzie? I told you, I don’t know. That’s a lie. There you go with that distrust again. Could I have my phone back, please? Okay, fine. Maybe you’re right. Maybe I haven’t been honest with you, Karen. Maybe I do know more about you than I first let on. I know first hand that you can’t help everybody in this messed up world. That the strong have to choose carefully. I choose people who truly deserve it. Did you choose me... Daniel? No. No. It was destiny, Karen. Do you believe in destiny? One night, when I was in college... I was out with my some friends, and, I was drinking a little too much. Really, the next morning, I got my car and I headed home. I was definitely too drunk to drive. Now the more that you drink, the worse you are at making decisions. And you can make some really poor decisions when you’re under the influence, right? I mean, you know, Karen. Once that alcohol hits your bloodstream, goes straight to your head, you can’t think. So, was it my fault? It wasn’t my fault that I was driving on the wrong side of the road. My car flipped over and all I know... I didn’t know when it was gonna stop. It felt like forever. And then, finally, it did. And I was alive. You know, that was a miracle. You know, unfortunately, the mother and daughter that were in the other car, they... Well, they didn’t have the same destiny as me. It’s funny, isn’t it? I was the drunk one, yet I lived and they... were driving cross country to visit a sick friend. And they died. You should’ve thought about the consequences before you drank. You’re blaming the alcohol, but you murdered those people. First of all, I am not a murderer, okay? In the eyes of the law, it’s manslaughter, not murder. And I served my time. -What, like a month or two? -Actually, it was six months. -It’s ridiculous. -I was in college, Karen. Was it really my fault? Or was it society’s fault? Maybe it was my parents’ fault. What’s the difference? It could’ve easily been you, too. -No. No. -Come on, Karen. Be honest with me. You’ve never driven a car drunk before. See? We’re the same. No, we’re not. Anyway, I haven’t got to the point of why I’m telling you this story. Yeah. You know why don’t you tell me how this is a destiny? Because you... You’re my guardian angel. We’ll put you back together again, okay? And now, we’re here together. Strong. Finally. Bitch! -No, please! No! Stop it! -Down. Help me, please! Stop. Let me go, please. Help! Let me go, please! -Leave me! -Stop, Karen! Please, stop! Let me go, please! We’re meant to be together. -It’s destiny, Karen. -Please, no, no, no, no! Stop fighting! No! Let me go, please! Stop... No! God, please, don’t! No! Please let me go! God! No, please, please don’t! This is wrong. This is wrong, wrong, wrong. This was not how this was supposed to be. You did this, both of you. Hope you know that. Karen. I thought that you could see. I thought that you knew. It’s okay. You helped me once, and I just trying to help you. Show you how tough I could be when you were weak, when you needed someone, and what did you do? You went and spit in my face. My God! Hey. Yeah, I... I think my friend, she’s in trouble... I had hope going into this. I hope you know that. I really did. But I’m not an idiot. I’m not naive. - No! - I know what women are like. You know, I wake up every day... No. And I try to make a difference in someone’s life. Something real. And tonight, I did something for you. I did something for you, Karen. And you didn’t even care.? It didn’t matter to you. Like I didn’t matter. I was wrong about you, Karen. Are you kidding me? Who’s that? Who is that? You don’t know? If either of you make a sound, I’m gonna slit the other one’s throat. Is that clear? Yeah. - Who is it? - It’s me. Let me in. Are you out of your damn mind? -How did you find me? -I followed you here, man. What the hell are you doing here? Open the door. I’m not telling you again! Nice! Hey, you remember me? How you doing? Hey, we need to talk. About what? About this. What is that? Remember the drunk guy who was here earlier? He was just about ready to call the cops. But I put a stop to that. Yeah, I thought you might need my help, so I stuck around. It’s a good thing for you that I did. What do you want me to do about that? Well, this obviously goes above and beyond what we first discussed. I assume you want me to take care of the body. Look, I don’t have any more money. I gave you everything, okay? Is that right? Well, then, you’re just gonna have to find a way to come up with some more, won’t you? We gotta get out of here. Yeah, well, where are we gonna go? We’re gonna go to her house. And what are we gonna do with them? You’re gonna pick ’em up and you’re gonna put ’em in her car. Fine. Come here. Let’s go. No! You get in there and keep quiet. Don’t say a word. Where’s Karen? Where’s my friend? -She’s fine. -Don’t tell me she’s fine. I don’t trust you. And who is this guy? Karen! Izzie! Get off of me! Get off of me! Get off of... What are you doing? What... Let go! Stop it! Let’s go. Come on, come on. Let’s move. Come on. Shh! Let’s go inside. Move! Come on! Looking good, pretty little thing. Come here, come here. Don’t be nervous. Don’t be shy. Come on. Come here, come here. -Hey. -Come on. Hey! Get away from her! Hey. Hey! Or what? What you gonna do? This has gone way beyond staging some little fist fight and taking a couple of shots to the jaw. And you don’t think I know that? Look, I’m real sorry that your weird little courtship ritual has gone sideways here. -Shut up! -But it’s not my fault! Shut up and let me think. Whatever, man, just stay out of my way. Come here. This is wrong. This is wrong. This is wrong. Damn it! Hey! Stop! Did you somehow get the impression that I was still working for you? I didn’t think so. Come here. Yeah. Back to what I was doing. -Yeah, come here. -Hey, what... What the hell do you think you’re doing, man? I’m taking my compensation! -You got a problem with that? -You’re disgusting. Look, you’re not paying me to take the fall for you this time. So just back up off of me! Come on, let’s go upstairs. Come on, come on. Come on. Now, I’m looking at you. Now, I’m not that bad, anyways. Come on, let’s go. Let’s go. Come on. Let’s go upstairs. You and me, yeah. Yeah, you and me? Yeah, come on. I’ve waited for this for a long time. Come on, come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. No. Don’t be like that. No, not gonna hurt you, okay? Come on, come on. Let’s go, let’s go. We’ll go have a good time? Come on. What did you do? No! What did you do? What did you... I just injected you with a lethal dose of carbon tetrachloride. The chemical is attacking your central nervous system right now, mostly your liver and your kidneys. It works very fast. Yeah, your, pulse is already slowing. Your blood pressure is dropping. Karen, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. Look... I know I’m not perfect. Okay? But, but, look, now I really did save you. Right? Look, I know, I know the way that I went about proving it to you before. It was flawed. I get it, it was flawed. But, now this, look! This really is destiny. Right? Right? He’s not dying. Okay. I’m gonna take care of this, okay? I’ll be right back. I’m gonna protect you. Okay? Okay. You know what I’m really made of now, Karen. The kind of man I truly am. Karen, in light of everything, do you think you could... Karen? Hurry. He’s gonna know we didn’t go out the front door. Don’t forget. -Okay. -Hurry. Get these off of me. My hands are turning purple. I don’t think it’s gonna work. Karen? Karen? Karen? Karen? Karen? Karen! -Yeah. -Okay? Karen! Karen, please. Karen... Karen, I need to talk to you. Karen, please, I need you to understand! Come on, come on, come on. Come on. How do you, call 911 from a computer? I don’t know. I have no idea. Put... Post on social media. Okay. That’s a good idea. Karen, please. Tell everyone you know on social media to call the police. Karen, what are you doing in there? Looking up. Okay. -What happened? -It’s not working. No. My God. He cut the modem. -Okay. -I got one-- Karen! Karen, please come talk to me. Karen! Karen? Karen! He’s gonna break down the door. Karen! Karen! Karen, I just wanna talk to you. Karen, why are you doing this to us? -Karen! -I don’t wanna talk to you. Karen! Karen, I just wanna talk to you. Why are you doing this to us? What, what are you doing? Just leave us alone. I just wanna talk to you, Karen. I just wanna talk to you. Just wanna talk to you. Okay? Shh, it’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay. Karen, it’s okay. Shh. It’s okay, Karen. It’s okay. I got you. Yeah. It’s okay. It’s okay. I thought I can make you see. I tried, Karen. I tried so hard. As soon as I met you in the hospital that day... I knew that you needed me in your life. What? I mean, I was in a pretty bad shape, but you... you were lost. I treated you? Sure, you did. Remember that story I was telling you earlier? Well, it gets better. What are you talking about? When I was in the ambulance, the paramedics, they, they did such a good job with CPR on me, they broke my sternum in three places. It hurt like a son of a bitch. But they weren’t the ones who saved my life. That was you, Karen. You saved my life. You are my guardian angel. And I fell in love with you in that very moment. I knew right then that I had to have you. But it took me years to recover from my injuries, jail time and... self-hatred and the alcoholism. But I’m now here with you finally. Now what matters is that you and I are together finally. There’s chemistry between us. I know that you can feel it, Karen. In fact, you tried to kiss me earlier. You know, after you put me back together that night, I heard you fighting with your supervisors. Everybody there could tell that you were broken. You were strung out, Karen. But I saw strength. Potential. Even after you had everything stripped from you, I saw you. And I watched you. For years, I watched you, Karen. I watched you heal. I watched you grow. But now... after all I’ve invested in you... you still don’t see me for who I am. And that hurts. I’m not made of stone, I’m strong but not unbreakable. No. No, no, no, no. I did everything I could, Karen. But it wasn’t enough. - No. - It wasn’t enough. Better. - Shh. There, there. - No, no. There, there. What did you do, Karen? What did you do? Izzie? Hey, wake up. Wake up. My God. Okay, wake up. Hang on. Breathe for me. Just breathe. Just breathe for me. Is my friend gonna be okay? We’re gonna get her to the hospital and on dialysis, ASAP. I’m coming! She’s in good hands. Ma’am? Ma’am, I need to ask you a couple of questions. Um, I just wanna make sure that my friend is okay. That’s okay, I’ll take you to the hospital after this, but first, I need you to tell me what happened here last night. Ma’am? Ma’am? Her main focus has been to serve others. She’s practiced rigorous honesty and she’s been a pillar to not only me but to our whole group. Needless to say, this has been a hell of a year for our friend, Karen. But, today, we celebrate. We celebrate 365 days of sobriety. And to make it even sweeter, she was just informed that they’re reinstating her medical license. Karen, you are the strongest, most resilient woman I have ever known. And your story is gonna inspire people your whole life. Just like it inspired all of us in this group. And we’re so blessed to have with us a special guest today, Karen’s best friend, Izzie. Karen... To say that we’ve been through a lot would be... an understatement. I love you more than anything. I love you, too. And even in your darkest moments, even in my darkest moment... you were there for me. And even though I’m older than you, only slightly older than you... I really look up to you, Karen. Congratulations, honey. I thought I could make you see. You are still so blind. Karen? Karen? Hey. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. Karen, hon, come on up here. We’ve got something for you. Congratulations. Okay. We got ice cream and cake out in the hall. So let’s go celebrate. Yeah.
