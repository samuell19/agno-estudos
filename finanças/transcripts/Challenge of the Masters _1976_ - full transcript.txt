In a duel, gradually merging force with mercy, combined with Qi Gong, can the foe be controlled Hard Soft Enforce Direct Inhale Restrain Thrust Suppress Pao' tradition has been in Guangdong for a long time At festival, there's bound to be a scramble for 'Paos' It was said whoever grabbed 'Pao' in competition ...wouldn't only claim to be the best in martial arts but also acquire fame, money and good fortune A winner could keep that 'Pao' until the next year ...and then start competing again The gods would be honoured with a sumptuous feast The crowd has gathered early this year Yes, a greater turnout than last Put it over there Go away... Make way... Hey, move this 'Pao' aside Ours was put here in the first place ...why do we have to move it Get lost Don't move! You're being unreasonable I don't know what is reasonable Stop fighting Don't you know rules of the game? There should be no fighting or you'll be disqualified Last year they got one... from who knows where; they must be dreaming ...to hope for another one this year We'll know when we've fought for it Get your master Lu Ah Tsai to compete with us ...or ask him to go to hell Ask his senior Hung Xi Guan to come out Hung Xi Guan! Stop quarreling Place your respective 'Pao' properly Move it over there Let's go Go Put it over there Step aside... I've got it Huang Fei Hung, please go back Fists have no eyes and we might accidentally injure you That's it... Right! You're no martial artist why do you hang out with us? Go... I may not necessarily lose when it comes to fighting Your father's skills are good And if you're injured... we'll take the blame for it Do you guys agree? Yes, please go back... Stop it You're bullying Ah Hung again He's wrong in the first place He's wrong... Ah Hung, go back first No one is bullying me, no one dares I don't want your help The contestants this year ...are more than last year You're no martial artist, why do you care? Ah Hung, say hello to uncle Cheng Uncle Cheng What, been fighting again? What skills have I to fight with others! How rude of you to speak to your father like this! Let it go, he's just a kid Get out Go quickly Please sit! I really don't understand With your excellent skills you have no pupils It makes sense to be cautious but don't you even trust your own son You wouldn't know, this kid has a strong temper He'll surely cause trouble if he knew kung fu Come... teach me kung fu Young Master, I'm busy now Rubbish! Come on, teach me kung fu What? Teach me kung fu I'll make a laughing stock of myself That's better than knowing nothing at all Your father is Huang Chi Ying Your great uncle is Luk Ah Tsai Who in Guangzhou dares to cross you Why do you need to learn kung fu? It's easy to learn a few tricks To learn real kung fu means a lot of pain Do I look like someone who would shy away? Your father will not teach you kung fu ...no matter who reasons with him I have a plan I gurantee your father will teach you kung fu What is it? You go and pick a fight outside then have people carry you back a few times When he sees his son injured ...he'll be ready to teach you Damn you If I'm beaten up outside... I'll surely be beaten up much worse ...by father when I return Then I don't know what to do Go... go! Go! Uncle Ho You've come Please take a seat over there Please sit Uncle Ho, for the competition this time please teach us more devastating techniques I'm just afraid that master ...won't agree As long as we can win and gain face for him ...he wouldn't care how we won Alright then As to the details of the techniques... I'll tell you when we get back I have to go now What's with uncle Ho? Come here I tell you It's better that teacher be angry with us ...than step on uncle Ho Once I heard master tell uncle Ho ...not to use the Sharp Kick, or even the Mei Far spear at will; But when I asked teacher... the existence of such skills was denied I got a good scolding, too Have you asked uncle Ho? No, teacher has instructed me not to even mention them He only told me those two skills ...are real deadly Is teacher Lu in? I don't know Why are you staring at me? I thought you were his pupil but you aren't I wish I were Sorry Is teacher Lu in? Yes Arise... don't stand on ceremony Your teacher has been a distant acquaintance No need to be formal. Please be seated Please be seated Have some tea Master Lu, I would like to know... if there is someone discreet in Guangzhou ...who knows the Sharp Kick and Mei Fa Spear These two techniques... are the deadliest in northern style kung fu I haven't noticed You... I am pursuing a robber Someone said he got to Guangzhou a year ago ...but I have never been able to find him It's difficult to say There are hundreds of martial arts schools here And tens of thousands of martial artists If one or two were hiding among them ...it's difficult to find them When I came... I saw a young man in the alley I thought he was your pupil He has keen eyes and is agile; a real talent for martial arts What did this person in the alley ...say to you? Let go I'm asking you I'd rather not answer Let's see about that Come on, speak up Ah Hung, stop it... stop fighting Break it off Sir, for the sake of his father ...let him go Who is his father? Huang Chi Ying What's up? I haven't seen you for a year Didn't imagine your Qi Gong to be so good! I admire you. Come, please sit Have some tea Please How has your business been? I've already... What is it? Losing temper again Who is it? My kid Your kid Congratulations He will be great Stop kidding, he doesn't know about business I was referring to kung fu I have never taught him kung fu Master Pang, my pupils often fight If they lose it is my fault They don't learn properly But your pupils... shouldn't have injured my pupils that seriously I'm asking master Lin Tao Cheung to judge this matter Master Pang, please speak You said yourself your pupils don't learn well ...what else is there to say! Master Pang, your pupils often cause trouble Stop... Who has been injured? No one Then be careful If they run into my pupils, move aside ...and don't invite injuries People may fear you and Lu Ah Tsai ...but I won't be scared Master Tang, let's go. It's a waste of time Stop it Stop You two get lost Brother Ho Brother Pang, sorry Yeung Chung, Ren Leung, come here In few days there will be a 'Pao' competition I'll make some arrangements ...such that those connected to Lu will not grab any 'Pao' Good How many sons does Huang have? One, Huang Fei Hung Only one What a joke He knows no kung fu ...but has a tough neck His kind will never plea Ah Hung Brother Hang What are you doing? I... Come... let's go I... What's with you today? You've always been snappy As you call me brother so I'll take care of your problems You move ahead first Right, let's go first... I want to go with you to the competition No, no You think that's a mere game but if you're not good one could lose life Let me go and watch at least, I'll not participate No You said you would help me I should have gone to brother Cheung It's useless even if you ask your father Ah Hung, come Come Let's go Tsang Hang Look, a much larger crowd than last year Indeed What are you looking at?

It's all my fault I've brought shame to everyone and Brother Lin got wounded because of me Look If I really fight... I won't be your match Ah Hung, since uncle Chi will not teach you kung fu ...have you tried Master Lu? I stand at his door everyday ...for long periods But I haven't dared to ask The 'Pao' competition is pretty dangerous Yet without knowing kung fu you went for it Why do you lack courage now? Sau Lien sister, thank you I was right The future of Hung School ...rests with him! Don't let praises go to his head I know about what happened today I... Stop Young men will always be what they are When you learn kung fu ...you'll be disciplined Ah Hung I'll take you as my pupil Right, parent and child under the same tutor; That's a good thing ...and will be praised by posterity Yuan Ching, go and fetch Chi Ying but don't tell him what it is about yet Yes How will you thank me? I was joking, you wait for your dad Uncle Yuan Don't worry, your father should be happy He won't object I am not referring to this Uncle Yuan, when you were here ...I was also in the alley Then someone grabbed me... and asked if you were looking for Master Lu He seemed tense Who was it? I know him He is the sworn brother of Pang ...named Ho Fu Ho Fu Isn't that he? Looks like him Uncle Yuen, this man... Mind your own business Get on with your training You're just a kid Don't bother with these things It's all because of Ah Hung Chi Ying, I've recently acquired a new pupil Congratulations Where's little brother? Although he is my pupil... he's however not your little brother It's little sister Bullshit Come out Dad It's you, Master... he... If you haven't had the time to teach him, I will Let's see if my skills are still good This must be a plot of Yuan's In a few days, I'll take him to the village... and train him for two years. Can you bear with that? Come here Thank you, teacher Everyone Please be quiet This year, we've won two 'Paos' Lin Tao Cheung didn't get anything and... have been barred from entering competition for 2 years Everyone in Guangzhou ...will say that our Master is great Help yourself What's the matter? Nothing, somebody's looking for me I'll go and have a look Come on, everyone Yuan Ching Yan Er-Fu, you are good at hiding You are good in finding Your men... in Shiu Hing jail await you If you want to get me... come with me to the forest Officer Yuan, your sword skills have improved a lot Your Mei Fa Spear is not bad either Qi Gong Did you think that with 1 year's training in Qi Gong ...you could withstand my Sharp Kick?! Don't cause more trouble because of 'Pao' contest Chi Ying, where's Yuan Ching? Master, Yuan Ching lighted a fire We'll have to trouble you again But there's no sign of him Alright, you all go back Dad Yes When I see Yuan Ching, I'll thank him for you I don't know how to thank him You might actually hate him for training you too hard Brother, who is my father... such that I am so useless? How can you speak about your father like that? Fei Hung, let's go Ah Hung is in luck Master Lu will teach him personally Master Master What's the matter? Dead! Ah Lung, your wife's dead Your wife is dead Your wife is dead! I don't even have a wife Ah Lung, what's the matter? Master, Master Yuan is dead Yuan is really dead! Master, the officer said that... He died in the forest Uncle Chi, who did this? The person he was looking for That person knows the Sharp Kick But with his kung fu... even if he got kicked, shouldn't have died like this But he... Something's wrong We're good friends After the autopsy, I'll bury him Alright Unicorn Steps Squat down and lean forward Advance Jump kick Left kick You can't take it anymore Master, I'm alright That's it. We'll continue with the training tomorrow Master, what's this for? This has been taken from the Shaolin... wooden men alley You are not qualified for this training yet Master, that's easy Wasn't it easy to pass... the wooden men alley in Shaolin? Master, let me try Alright Master, is that correct? Again Master... You just attack but forget to defend Stop Master... Tiger and crane moves of Hung style It assumes the power and ferocity of a tiger Look at you it doesn't look like Tiger Fist at all; it's Cat Fist You should never have the intention to hurt others ...but you should always be brave If you don't have such courage... how can you be good with Tiger Fist?! I've got it You still don't get it I get it Let me ask you. If Yuan was killed... and the killer's kung fu is better than yours; ...what are you going to do? Master, why are you unnecessarily ...cursing Uncle Yuan? Three months ago, when we left Guangzhou... he was struck by the Sharp Kick ...and died in the forest! No, Uncle Yuan wouldn't die Who killed him? Get up Master, I just want to go back and ask father ...about Uncle Yuan's death Master I know who killed Uncle Yuan Who? I'm not telling you I won't let you go I want to personally avenge uncle Yuan Just as well Wait till your kung fu is better When will my kung fu be good? There's no end to kung fu When you fight with me from now on... I'll use one hand. Until you can make this pouch drop ...then you're ready Do weapons count? What weapons? The stick You do realize that our school lays... emphasis on the fist and the stick The stick is 7 feet long; The power is lodged within 3 inches at the head You must use the stick to draw circles ...to train your eyes and reflex such that you can attack and defend at will If your skills are no good, and you make a mistake... 5 days into training and yet you break so many dishes Master, how long have you trained at the stick? From dishes to bowls; And then to wine bowls I spent ten months Your uncle Hung Xi Guan only did eight He is so talented I only trained for 5 days... Strike the drums Yes Stop We won't have the lion dance this year Why... Master Lu is not here Uncle Chi has gone to see to his affairs So what's your concern? Pang and his men... are always looking for trouble My wound has just healed So we won't have the lion dance this year We might have to bow to others ...for forgiveness Shut up! Don't you remember what Master Lu ...told you when he left? Don't cause any trouble, pack up Fine, what's the big deal What are you doing? You have overstepped your boundary Isn't this too much? Too much? You couldn't even grab one 'Pao' Even if you were shameless you wouldn't dare to do the lion dance What's with Lin Tao Cheung? Can't even get up! Don't touch me Right, don't touch him You should... Fight Don't fight Come here Who asked you to fight Look, they're scared We've put them in their place Stop Brother It's no use even calling for the Grand Master Go Go Perform the lion dance Follow me Come back Wishing master good health Master, come Alright Not bad, not bad Master, there's still a long way to go Ah Hung Kung fu cannot be learned in a couple of years You may feel you've learnt something after 2 years; But after 20 years... you'll realize you still have a long way to go Then you acknowledge you are not so good after all and that's the beginning of success Stop Ah Hung, remember what I've told you I have devoted... a lot of time in practising with pole Ten months How about you? Nine months. I've lived up to your expectation In these past months ...why haven't you ambushed me? Master, the more I learn... the more I know I can't depend on luck Before I'm totally ready... it will be futile to try my skills He is smart in learning Deadly Thrust Again Ah Hung Master You haven't seen your father for 2 years Don't you want to go home? No I can never force you to use both hands You fear that forcing me to use both hands ...will make you feel bad; Would make you feel I'm old and useless! Teacher, that's not what I meant I know that's what you are thinking Ah Hung, I took you as my pupil I was hoping you would glorify the school Would I feel bad? I would be only too happy Ah Hung, not only you realise that in Kung Fu ...there's no place for luck; But you also care for others' feelings This is the moral discipline of martial arts It's more valuable than your advancement in kung fu With your Kung Fu when you defeat someone... you conquer him physically But when you think for others... and you are just and reasonable; You capture his heart This is the quintessence of kung fu More forgiveness, less aggression' Ah Hung, you must remember this Yes Master, I'll remember that Get up Ah Hung, I don't feel old at all, come Master... Master Yuan Ching should rest in peace What are you looking at? Don't you recognize me? Yes, but you look different Nonsense Ah Lung... go to Pang's martial arts school for me Right, I should settle everything with them In the past 2 years, they've made me very angry Who says I'm looking for a fight Don't let anyone know that... you're looking for Ho Fu When you see Ho Fu ...just tell him: Something has happened in the forest Someone is waiting for him in the forest Something happened there Someone is waiting for him in the forest C'mon hurry, but don't mention my name And don't speak about it to anyone Who is it? Come out You are... I'm one of the pupils of... Master Yuan, who died under your feet It's just you alone?! Yes And I haven't told anyone You want to... You are the robber whom Officer Yuan chased after I have to send you to prison for him Good! The 8 diagram pole Residue of Shaolin Come and arrest me More forgiveness, less aggression' Ah Hung, remember these words Master, Uncle Ho has been arrested Stop Is it real? Yes Uncle Ho's name is not Ho He is called Yan Er-Fu; ...and he's a murderer and robber Master, we have no knowledge of this at all ...but don't worry I'll ask my dad to take care of everything No need I admire his kung fu That's why I addressed him as 'brother' He hasn't committed any crime here I don't think I'll get involved Officer Yuan who died in the forest 2 years ago ...was actually killed by him He has been arrested in the forest today; but with his kung fu, who could fight him! Huang Fei Hung Ah Hung, you're never at home and there's no sign of you There'll be 'Pao' competition in a few days I should help brother Cheung this year ...to win There's not much going on with Pang The officials have confirmed Yan's identity What does he have to say? Well, it's unlikely he'll defend a robber Of course Pang would not do that But I know him; ...he hates your guts! Ah Hung, it's difficult to defend against treachery I also heard something that... they'll pick on us in this year's competition But we're not scared Pang will recruit anyone as his pupil He is head-strong, opinionated and defensive There's nothing more to it He's pretty good at martial arts As things have come to this situation; To make him lose one more time ...will generate more hatred in him Ah Hung, have you thought about this? I hope you haven't let it out to anyone No The people at the smith's wouldn't know who ordered it Close the door Come over here This is the iron ruler ...used mainly for hitting the shin Be quick and forceful Use it against all those related to Lu Ah Tsai Yeung Chung, come over here You lead a team using the iron ruler ...to fight Huang Fei Hung Ren Leung, you lead another group against Lin I'll make sure they won't get any 'Pao' this year You... Give it to me Sesame oil Please be quiet Can I have your attention please All those who are not participants in the contest ...please stand aside Please listen to the rules for the contest First, don't cause trouble or a fight Second, no hidden weapons Third, no undue criticisms or hurting others intentionally 4th, no grabbing of 'Pao' which have been taken Offenders will be forbidden... to take part in the contest for 3 years Now start Form two circles Everyone, go Take it Charge Roll forward Don't fight... Brother Take it Tsang Hang I've got it, I've got it I've got the 'Pao' I've got the 'Pao' Go!... I've got the 'Pao' If you can conquer their hearts ...that will be real victory If he loses one more time... it'd just cause more resentment Ah Hung, have you thought about this? Don't fight Please The worid of martial arts is like a one big family No need for formalities, please Please Your son is righteous and magnanimous Master Pang, don't praise him too much Master Pang ought to teach him more I've always reminded them: Martial artists should have moral discipline' Master Pang, do you agree? Absolutely Did you hear what Uncle Chi said? This time it's my idea that... our pupils should carry a hidden weapon Don't mention this again No, I have to punish myself Master Pang...
