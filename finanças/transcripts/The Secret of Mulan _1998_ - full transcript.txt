NARRATOR: It was the year of the Fire Horse in the reign of Emperor Xin Chiang, long before your grandmother's grandmother was born. It was a time of barbarian invaders led by the brutal Mala-Khan. It was a time when the people prayed for heroes. -Loot. I've got loot. -Look at that, Bow-Tie. Isn't it glorious? -(SINGING) Mala-Khan Mala-Khan, trampling over your front lawn. Mala-Khan, Mala-Khan, pillaging and looting. Mala-Khan, Mala-Khan, backed with brains and beetle brawn. Mala-Khan, Mala-Khan, villages uprooting. -(SINGING) Yes, I am Mala-Khan. See the fearsome way my name is heard. Yes, I've a little plan. Taking over all the blessed world. -(SINGING) Mala-Khan, Mala-Khan. A truly fine phenomenon. Mala-Khan, Mala-Khan. -(SINGING) Those wishing to achieve evil. Soon sign on with Mala-Khan, the bug you should be betting on. Mala-Khan, Mala-Khan. -(SINGING) I'm your evil weevil. -(SINGING) Yes. He is Mala-Khan. But I've my own special brand of theft. He gets to rule the world, but I get to take whatever's left. -(SINGING) Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. -(SINGING) Other Khans are just a yawn. -(SINGING) Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. There's no better beetle. -(SINGING) Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. He's the dark before the dawn. Please be sure to evacuate, because your tomorrow will be gone. Mala-Khan, Mala-Khan, Mala-Khan, Khan, Khan. Ma- La- Khan. Mala-Khan. -Onward to the Emperor's palace. NARRATOR: This is a tale of one of the most famous heroes of all, Mulan. Born in a small village to a family of farmers, there was little indication of what the future held. Well, maybe there was a hint or two. -Mulan, would you please stop wasting time with that stuff? -It's not a waste. -Learning warrior skills is useful no matter what you do. Skills like balance, endurance, and speed. -Mulan. -I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to. -You never do. -How will you ever find a husband? No man wants a rebellious, headstrong girl who doesn't know how to behave. -You behave your way. I'll behave mine, and we'll see what happens. -Honored grandfather, are you sure the river will stop them? -The river has always been our strongest defense. -Drums. Calvary. -For the Mala-Khan and victory. Careful, you stupid bug. No. No. Cross the river. -You see. The river does protect us. -Next. -Shing-Shing, report. -Prince Jian, there are thousands of them, and they have-- they have wasps. -The emperor is the heart of his people. You should return to the capital, where it is safe. -Where are your servants? Can-Do. -Here, sir. -And-How. -At your service. -You must take the emperor to safety at once. -Can do, my prince? -What do you need? -Nothing. What do you want? -Don't stand around. The barbarians are coming. Make haste. -And how. -Stop bugging me. -You stop bothering me. -Never mind. Just go. -Farewell, grandson. I will see you when you have driven these barbarians from our kingdom. -Ready the archers. Aim. Release. -Mosquitoes! Run! -What do you think you're doing? -About four knots. -Make it 10. That way. -Aim. Release. -Wasps. It's wasps. -What? Do not think you have beaten us. The war has only begun. -Now, let them tremble and beg for mercy. Let them fall down at my feet in blind terror. -Make way. Make way for Mala-Khan the mega and mighty. Mala-Khan the Magnamnificent. Mala-Khan the-- argh. The awfully muddy? -Bow-Tie, I should have left you to rot in the garbage heap where I found you. You useless, filthy wretch. -But, sir, if I may say so, it gives you that extra touch, the great tyrant trampling your enemies in the mud. -Shut up and grovel. Oh yes, yes, most mighty mentally mordacious Mala-Khan, most wondrous, lustrous and lordly. Not to mention, heavy. [trumpet] -Barbarians have crossed the river. The kingdom is under attack. His imperial highness orders every able-bodied man to report to the army immediately. -You must take care of each other while I am gone. -But father, you have already served the emperor, and you have the war wound to prove it. -Hush, daughter. Ewui, fetch my armor. -Sir, Mulan is right. You're no longer the young man who wore this armor into battle. -The emperor calls, and I must go. -But you would only come to harm. Let someone else go. -It is my duty. Would you let our village fall to the barbarians? -But father. -Enough, Mulan. I have no son to go in my place. So I must go. I will leave in the morning. -There, there. We'll try talking sense into him tomorrow. -But he's right. The honor of our family must be upheld and our village defended. We must not fail the emperor. -You do not fool me, young miss. -(SINGING) For honor, for country I'm told to keep my place. To stay here, to wait here, it's more than I can face. But in my father's mind, a daughter stays behind. I don't know what, but that's what I must do. The sun used to shine to paint all the trees. Every morning, the light shone through. Now, by Heaven's design, there's a harsh winter breeze that has changed all I thought I knew. For honor, for country, because I love this land. I'll fly now or die now. He's got to understand. The time has come to fight for what I know is right. And I'll fight to do what I must do. I'm ready to do what I must do. EWUI: Going somewhere, Mulan? -Ewui, don't try to stop me. -I served your father when he went to war. And now, I will serve you. -Thank you, Ewui. -Besides, I don't want to be around here when your father finds out you're gone. Hurry. EMPEROR: Where is that messenger? -Shong-Jing has arrived. -What's happening? Is the prince-- -The prince is well. Though, the invaders have reached the foothills. -This cannot be allowed to continue. As each company of new recruits is formed, they must be sent to the battlefield immediately. Go. -Look. Everything's so big. -Then, your heart must swell to match, Mulan. -What do I call myself? I'm sure no soldier is named for the magnolia flower. -Battlefields would smell better if they were. Soldier Hua. -Huh? -No. Hoo-ah. -Hoo-hoo. -Are you an owl? "Hua" means flower. You will be Soldier Hua. -Ah. -No. Hoo-ah. Here. -Soldier Hua reporting for duty. -Join the platoon, Hua. We march to battle. Ah, this is the life. Isn't it, comrade? -Yes. I mean, (DEEP VOICE) yes. -Urgent message for the emperor. -What is it? -The prince has fought valiantly. But our losses are high, and the barbarians have pushed us back into the mountains. It is hopeless. -Obviously, the old ways are not working. It is said the highest realization of warfare is to attack the enemy's plans. I must know their plans. You're still here, Shong-Jing? I said I need more information. Go. -That is it? No thanks. No nothing. I am of royal blood. Not one of his peasant recruits. How dare he treat me like this? -Attack! -Courage! -Wasps to flank. -You're mine. -In your dreams. -This isn't a picnic. Go get them! -Ewui, follow me. Never give up hope. Charge! -Charge? -For the emperor! In recognition of outstanding courage and loyalty to the emperor, I, hereby, appoint Soldier Hua captain of the White Chrysanthemum platoon. Rise, Captain Hua. ARMY: Yay! -How could they possibly have beaten us? We outnumbered them 10 to one. It should have been impossible. -Unthinkable. It's inconceivable. Not to mention, embarrassing. -It was that worm of a soldier, the one leading his troops under the White Chrysanthemum banner. He's the one who broke our attacks. He must be smashed. -Smushed, crushed, splooshed. -There must be someone in that army willing to betray that soldier or the prince. -Or both. Maybe we could even get two for the price of one. -Yes. Find me a traitor, Bow-tie. There's nothing like the though of treachery to brighten up my day. PRINCE: I have a special mission, and I need two volunteers. -You may count on me, great prince. -And me. -You honor your ancestors and your emperor. -Looks like a scouting party to me. What do you think? -Huh? -I think I found a couple of spies. The chief will be right pleased to have a couple of the emperor's slugs to interview. -Now. -Hiya. Ya. -Hiya. -For the Khan. Yikes. -You're a girl. -Yes. I know. My real name is Mulan. -So two girls took care of the horde's warriors. What a great story that would make. What a shame I can't tell anyone. -Then, you'll keep my secret? -Of course. Look out. -Ya. -We must hurry and warn the prince. ARMY: Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. Mala-Khan. -It's a trap. -Send the first signal. Attack. -Protect me. -There's no time for groveling. -Yes, great Khan. -Faster. Cross the river. They may have won today, but I won't allow them to be so lucky next time. -Signal Captain Hua. -Surrender in the name of the emperor. -A brilliant plan, well-executed, Captain Hua. I'm impressed. ARMY: Hua! Hua! Hua! BOW-TIE: Oh, splendiferous Khan, master of deceit. I found what you wanted, a traitor. -Such a harsh word, Bow-Tie. He is simply wiser than his foolish comrades. Hear this promise my new-found friend. Serve me well, and you will have whatever reward you desire in the empire of Mala-Khan. -Never attack first when out numbered. Wait. Find ways to disrupt the enemy, and then attack. Disrupt their supply lines. Provide false information. Decoy them into splitting their attention, but beware of them doing the same to you. -Captain Hua, you are needed immediately. -Now? -That is what immediately means. Come on. -What is it? I thought the prince sent you to get me. -No. Even better. You won't believe it. I'm in love. -Shing-Shing, we're in the middle of a war. -I know. Isn't it wonderful? Who'd have though I'd meet someone here, and he's a prince. -Not the prince. -No, not him. He thinks only of the war. No. This is someone much nicer. In fact, he really wants to meet you. -You didn't tell him I'm a girl, did you? -No. No. It's just I talk about Captain Hua so much, I think he's jealous. -Jealous of me? -Uh-huh. I can't wait for you to meet him. [whistle] Captain Hua, permit me to introduce the emperor's messenger, Prince Shong-Jing. -You have no idea how much I've looked forward to this moment. -Let go of me. -What are you doing? Stop! Come back. -Thanks for the help, sweetheart. I'll see you get a share of the reward. -What have I done? -Where are you taking me? -To someone who appreciates me, to Mala-Khan. -Mala-Khan? -Wasn't it nice of Shing-Shing to help me? -I don't believe you. You tricked her. Shing-Shing would never betray me. And you're left with nothing, traitor. SHONG-JING: You can't escape, but your demise will serve the Khan equally well and be much easier for me. Farewell, captain. -Whoa. Wow. I think I just used up an entire lifetime's luck. I feel so strange. What's happening to me? -Then Shong-Jing grabbed Captain Hua and flew off. -Do you know where he's taken the captain? -He mentioned a reward. -I think, I think he's working for Mala-Khan. -And you helped him? -I didn't know. -Out of my sight, Shing-Shing, before I have your head for consorting with a traitor. Although I will miss his talents, we must carry on without Captain Hua. -I promise, Mulan, I will find you. -I must see the Khan. I have important news. -The malodorous Khan is not to be disturbed. You may tell me. -Tell the Khan I have done away with his enemy. Captain Hua has drawn his final breath. -My plan worked. It worked. -(SINGING) Oh, who's the greatest vermin, the creepiest guy. Other worms are squirming when they see him pass by. I'm proud to be confirming they call me Bow-Tie. Though I'm not one to brag it, it's hard to deny. I was one precocious maggot. But now, I'm super fly. Yeah. It's my burden so I drag it. They call me, Bow-Tie. I kicked the caterpillars and stole their precious lands as Mala-Khan's number one thug. I'm not one of his killers, but I'm his two right hands. Without me he'd just be a bug. Don't mean to come off preachy, but how can I lie? -(SINGING) Lie. Lie. -(SINGING) Without me as their lychee, these stupid beetles would die. -(SINGING) Die. Die. -(SINGING) Oh, who's that cootie cutie with terror in his eye? Who steals and loots the booty and makes the slug bait cry? Yes, who's that thing of beauty? They call him-- -Bow-Tie! BOW-TIE: (SINGING) Mala-Khan. Yes, master. I'm here. Oh mighty malingering Mala-Khan, our brilliant plan has worked. Captain Hua is no more. -To battle. Start the drums. -We do this not just for us, but for the entire kingdom and to avenge Captain Hua. For the emperor and Captain Hua. -Ah. The joy of switching to the winning side at just the right moment. -Order them to advance. -But what if we're losing? -Did the one soon to be launched into eternity just question my order? -(CHANTING) March Advance. They're fighting, you stupid ants. -My prince, they just keep coming. We've taken fearsome loses. -Order the retreat. I'm sure Captain Hua would have a better plan, but-- ARMY: Retreat. -Mulan? Mulan! -Lonely. Want toy. -I am not your toy. The prince has retreated. Oh, if only Mulan were there. This is all my fault. I must find her. -Just you wait, Can-Du. Those scrolls are useless when it comes to the emperor's comfort. -Better wisdom than luxury, An-Hao. Wisdom can never be lost. -What good is wisdom if I'm forced to sleep on rocks? -Ah, but wisdom tells how to not mind the cold. [sneezes] -I hate cold. When you're cuddled with your scrolls, I'll be warm in pillows. -But those are the emperor's pillows, not yours, An-Hao. -Oh right, uh, want to share some of your wisdom so I don't mind the cold? -Most gladly. -Thanks so much. That's a great help. -Oh, this is wonderful, but why did it have to happen now? -Mulan, I'm so sorry. -Shing-Shing. -Do I know you? -Shing-Shing, it's me, Mulan. -Mulan? -Since Shong-Jing took you, things have been awful. -How long has it been? What's happened? -It's been weeks. We've lost battle after battle. It's almost as if you were the army's heart. Without you, they couldn't continue. -But I'm just a caterpillar. Well, I was. -But what are we going to do? -They need Captain Hua, so that's who they'll get. Mala-Khan has laid siege. We must hurry. Help me into my armor. -This is harder than it looks. -And I thought this was difficult to get into before. SHING-SHING: Arms -I feel like an over-stuffed pillow. -Hurry. Curl up your antenna. -Now. -Ta-da. -Now, how do I get down there in armor? -Simple. Like this. -Well, at least it's all down hill. -It can't be. I got rid of you once. This time it will be permanent. -It's Captain Hua. I found the captain. Help us. -Captain Hua? Captain Hua! Fire at will. Destroy Shong-Jing. Destroy the traitor. -I regret my disappearance, but I have returned. I am prepared to serve you with all the courage at my command. -As your disappearance was not under your control, I welcome you back, General Hua. ARMY: Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! -General Hua, your return has given us new hope. We have great need of your leadership skills and brave spirit. -I thank you. Your newest general has one request though, prince. Forgive Shing-Shing for her foolishness. Without her help, I could not have returned in time. PRINCE: So be it. Come. You have a strategy meeting to attend. -Master, you're safe. -Ewui, I'm so relieved to see you. -You've changed. -More than you can possibly imagine. PRINCE: [clears throat]. Over here, general. We must plan our defense. -It's gas. I'll handle it. Stand clear. -Oh no. -They're not going to stop until they've destroyed us all. -Prince Jian, you are trapped. Surrender, and I will show you mercy. -You will? -Of course not, you dolt. -Whew. You had me worried for a minute there. -I bid you to surrender while I am feeling merciful. -Listen to that false bravado. -It sounded pretty real to me. Right. He's a weakling, a pushover. No problem. -I challenge you to face in me in combat alone. -I accept. -No. -You must not. -I must honor the challenge. General Hua, you are in charge. For the emperor. -Bow-Tie, release the secret weapon. -Mala-Khan, face me. Warrior to warrior, no more tricks. -You're all that stand between me and conquest? Ha. Prepare to be squashed, little bug. -You can do it. SHONG-JING: Mala-Khan will take care of your general, and I'll take care of you. -You can't outrun me. -If you can catch me. -I've got you now. Yikes. -Pretty. Pretty. -Let me go. Don't you know who I am? -Ribbit. My new toy. -Any last words, general? -Khan you say goodbye? -Will I never be rid of you? -Never. -No! -It's over. -I'm back. -You'll never outrun me. Now I've got you. I don't suppose we could discuss this. -Prince Shun, your enemies are destroyed. PRINCE: Rise and face me. Who are you? -I am General Hua, though my family calls me Mulan. -You've had a good joke on us, Mulan. -Oh no. I only wanted to serve you. -I'm not sure which I like better, the courageous and loyal Hua or the brave and beautiful Mulan. -Then rejoice, my prince. For now you have both. -(SINGING) My land is a beautiful land from the hills to the sky and from the sea to the sand. My land holds a beautiful dream. It's a promise of peace in every mountain and stream. And my home is a kingdom though it's humble and plain. And my heart's in this homeland, so it's here I'll remain. This time is our moment in time. No more rivers to cross and no more mountains to climb. This day, we'll remember this day as the day we could lift our heads and finally say that my home is a kingdom though it's humble and plain. And my heart's in this homeland, so it's here I'll remain in my land, my land. -Can-Du. -An-Hao. BOTH: Hua! [theme music]
