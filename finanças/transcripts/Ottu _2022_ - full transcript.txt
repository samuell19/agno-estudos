I've been sitting here wondering if I'd have to finish both. As if you don't like it! Listen... I stopped at the travel agency. That's why I got delayed. Sweden does have a golden visa program.. but Kichu, its going to cost a minimum of one lakh Euros for one. We can't afford even a normal visa! Let alone Euro and gold! Let's be practical here. - Okay, fine! - Okay! Kallu. Kallu? Kalyani, baby? Does Sweden have beaches? There's only snow, right? I wonder if people there have vada pavs and frankies. No, they don’t! Kichu, if you don't want to come, just tell me that. Stop goofing around! What do I do with you? Anything you wish. Listen... Did your Chaacha tell you what today's meeting is about? Nope! Whatever it is, Kichu, don't jump into it just for the money. The moment you sense it is something illegal, just bail. You get it, right? You wont get even a tourist visa. Don't say I didn't warn you. Okay... I'll see you. Bye! Kichu, you remember what I said? Okay! Chaacha? Who are we meeting? Would I ever do something that'd put you in harm's way? But you need so much money to leave and so soon. I was just wondering. The lesser you know, the better. You understand, don't you? Talk to them.. ...and take it up only if it's something you think you can. I'll take care of the rest. I'll be waiting downstairs. Would you like something to drink? Iced tea with mint.. Some water will do. Thanks. Did Mr. Shreedharan give you a brief? Chaacha told me only about the money. Your assignment is to befriend someone. Your Chaacha tells me you are good with people. [Snickers] Nope... He is not my type. He is not anyone's type. That is the problem. Have you heard of Assainar? He was the Kingpin of gold smuggling in the Bombay- Mangalore sector. Not a speck of gold would move without his approval. This man was his right hand. David. Not his right hand. His beating heart. Dawood... that was Assainar's nickname for him. Some time back they were attacked in Uduppi. Assainar died on the spot. David barely made it out alive. Inside the van was gold worth almost 30 crores. What went down that day who attacked them...nobody has a clue. And him? David lost his memory after the incident. Great! A bullet went into his head. Maybe it's that. Maybe it's the shock. He's not faking it. He has gone through torture that no human can survive. If he was faking, he would have caved a long time ago. Does he not have any relatives? No. Just like you. What your Chaacha is to you was Assainaar to David. [snickers] Umm.. If by any chance he realizes I work for you... ...will he take out on me, what you did to him? No, he's probably forgotten that too. His mind is now shutting out everything that causes fear or sorrow. That's why its hard so to open it now. This is the last attempt. This is your assignment. You have two weeks. By the end of it, you have to befriend him and find a way to bring his memory back. If you succeed, twenty five lakhs. And if I don't? Five lakhs. But you have to. I had told you not to jump in and say yes. Kallu... We need the money. You'll lose this job that you have waiting and our visas without it. Can I have a ticket? Befriend a street thug who's brain is a mush.. find out his past. You are insane, Kichu. I'm scared. Something's about to go wrong. Where are you going to meet this man? Don't even get me started, man! Things just went from bad to worse! I should have tried Malayalam serials.. ..should've tried my luck in Malayalam serials. Shouldn't have jumped into this Hindi thing. This Bhojpuri set up is pathetic. These theaters are ancient! Alright, man. I'll call you. The movie's about to begin. Bye. [in Hindi] Uh..brother Do you have any flavours? Caramel? Cheese? No? Uh... Damn, did he forget Malayalam too? [Bhojpuri dialogues playing on screen] I've added some salt and chilly. Anna! Hang on, Anna! Anna! You're a Malayali? I would have never guessed! Hang on! How much is this? Never mind. How's the business here? This is my first time here. I was at Navrang yesterday for the movie. Aren't these the only places that play Bhojpuri? Gulshan Talkies. In Kamathipura. Oh. Not there! My dream is to get into Hindi cinema. Not acting. Something technical. I was told that Bhojpuri is the easy way in. So first, I'd have to learn their style. The movie has started. Well, I have to return the favour! When do you get off? After this show's interval. Great, then let's leave together! Okay! Do you watch movies, Anna? Do you not like them? Or have you always not? - I don't know. - Namaste Thank you, sir. The film was unbearable! But still better than some recent Malayalam movies. Do you only watch bits and pieces of those as well? Oh. No memory trouble when it comes to punch dialogues. - How much? - Fifty It's on me! The manager knows people working in cinema. I'll put in a word for you. See you. Ah Kichu, Come on in. - [Kichu sighs] - Dinner? I'm not eating. I'm full. I met him today, Chaacha. Who? David. He is nothing like what we thought. He seems a nice man. Nothing, no one is like what they seem. All these years, I tried hard to make sure you are not mixed up in that world. Come on, Sreedharan da! Have your dinner and go to bed. Alright? Go that way. Ta-da! Eat it while it's still hot. That's when it tastes yummiest! Here. Kozhukkatta! I couldn't tell the manager about you. Are you saying I'm trying to bribe you with this? It's yummy! Do you like Kozhukkatta, Anna? I don't know. There's a stall near the Gateway. The white tourists buy these. Now it makes sense! We're both artists! No wonder we synced so well! Would you like some tea? I'm out of kerosene. That's alright. We can go out. - Sir, brun masca and tea? - Yes. Do you always eat outside? Occasionally I cook something...rice and dal. And are you married? Please don’t say you forgot! [both laugh] "Every city has a story to tell" "Every dawn lends a line to it" "There are so many streets to see here" "So many dreams to conquer" "Travelers they are" "They find one another, and keep moving" "These blue streets, days and nights, come and go" "Through words and gazes, the ice melts" "Through memories and moments, they see more clearly" It looks like you're going to steal my twenty five lakhs. He's going to remember stories from his past lives and tell you. Someone's jealous! Yeah, consider me jealous! [Kichu] He is still so good looking! - Imagine when he was young! - Come along, you idiot! You're not too bad yourself. "The depth of the ocean" "does the sky know?" "Will you search for the worlds" "under the dark of the night, Sunlight?" "On these paths where stories flow" "we look for twists and turns" "Where is the deception in our smiles?" "Where is the thrill we seek?" "A shadow and another that follows it merge into one" "and they take on winds and storms together as one" "Every city has a story to tell" "Every dawn lends a line to it" "There are so many streets to see here" "So many dreams to conquer" It's been a week. Apart from walking around beaches and parks what breakthrough have you had? You told me to befriend him first. Do you know how hard that was? In such a short time... Now he trusts me. I can build on this now. We are not saying that you aren't trying. Just reminding you that we're running out of time. You can't run this on a time table! You have been trying to do this for a while and failing. Show some patience! The time for patience is over. David's soon going to be history. Can't you let the poor man be? Let him live. "The poor man" He's a venomous snake. You have no idea. Maqbool. I told you several times that there's no point dragging this on forever. You do know that we have no use for his memory. If they end up killing each other, all the better for us! Call Patel. Let's not keep David alive any longer. Get out. Oh and one more thing. You have never met us. Or David. - Do you understand? - Ma'am? Ma'am please. Come, take a seat. We have another plan. Get David to repeat the old trip. You have to make it happen somehow. Bombay to Mangalore. If we're lucky... before you reach the place in Udupi where we was attacked his memory will return. It's not just his memory you hold his life in your hands. They'll kill David. Won't they? I told you...the lesser you know, the better So my job is to betray this man to his death. They aren't going to let David live for long now. Damn this! I had told you not to get involved in this. Get out of this now. Call whoever you need to call. Enough of this! It doesn't matter if I do it or not It will happen. If David remembers even a tiny bit of who he used to be, they won't be able to touch him! I'm sure! And what if he doesn't? Then I will tell him everything. Let him go somewhere and live! And what about you? Tell me, Kichu! What about you? "My mind is searching for a face in a thousand dreams" "Melting into her in a thousand pieces" A trip has come up...home. Need to drop off a vehicle at Thalassery. They'll pay for the trip and some more. It is a matter of two days. I can't travel that far alone. Will you come with me? Take Kalyani along. Oh...I asked her. She's always busy with work. Come along, Anna. Please. You get to see home. Huh? What home? This is my home. Home where everyone speaks Malayalam. Come on, Anna. It'll be fun! I have to ask my manager. I don't know what he is going to say Yeah right! No one's going to die here because they couldn't eat popcorn for a couple of days. Come on! If you like Kerala, settle down there. For the rest of your life. Happily. What are you saying? I'm just saying. "Are you a dream? Or the rhythm in my heart?" "Are you the magic that sees through me, that I myself haven't sought?" "I turn into your soft breath as I melt into your bosom" "Let us don these wings tomorrow, so that we can cross this ocean" Sir? The car is here. Anna! Hop in! We need to hit Goa before nightfall. I don’t know. I have a feeling I will never see this again. Come on, mister! We are going to be back here in a couple of days. - Hmm. - Yes. Put on the belt. All set. Okay? "Two hearts like autumn branches shedding its leaves." "The leaf of oblivion has given way to another season." You'd have had a few girlfriends in your time, right? [humming] Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat, Maratha, Dravida, Utkala...? Oh yea, you don’t know.. Fine...don't tell me! Are you hungry, Anna? - No - No? Let's have a tea then. I'm tired. Meanwhile, we can call Kallu. [Marathi speech in the background] Chaacha. Where have you reached? I don't know exactly where we've reached. Is everything alright? Everything's great so far. Have you eaten, Chaacha? I just did. Did you? [exaggerated bite] Be careful. Yes, Sreedharan da! I will call you..okay. Kallu! [Marathi speech in the background] [Marathi speech in the background] Shall we leave? Yeah. [Marathi speech in the background] Brother, what's happening here? Accident, brother. - Does this join the highway? - Take this road Ah.. Shall we? - That way? - Hmm. Feels like we are not on the right road. As in? Wrong route? Smugglers' route? Smuggling gold and other stuff past police and customs... Really? Easy, isn't it? Hello? Anna? [chuckles] If you're going to sleep, I will doze off too. And we will end up in a pit. [yawns] - Do you not drive at all? - No. Have you never driven? No. Look... There are no vehicles coming our way. The highway is rolled out like a mighty ocean. [grunts no] You can't sleep like this! No, Kichu. Stop. I'll fix this. - Kichu, listen to me - Get out Come on. No, Kichu! - Come on! - I don't know! Come on, man! Kichu! Step inside. Sit! Okay! Ignition... Turn this on, shift the gear, press down on the accelerator, and just hold the wheel. The car and God will take care of the rest. Let’s go. We have to hit Goa before nightfall. [screams] Yeah! Wohoo! If this is what you're going to wear no girl in Goa is going to look at you. Not just you, they won't even look at me if I'm with you. We're going to have to change up the whole thing. Anna! Wooo! Do you drink, Anna? No. You can't come to Goa and not have even a beer. Wohoo! Sit! Sit down, man! Nothing hot, right? Hi, one pitcher of beer and two mugs, please. Okay,sir. - Enjoy your drink, sir! - Thank you! So you've never seen this before? Yeah, right! [mumbles] Anna! We reach tomorrow... Once we do, you settle down there. Why? Just do it...please. Please. You have drunk enough for today. No, you listen to me.... Hey! Come here! - Sweetheart - Tell me, sir. - One pitcher beer. - Sure. Anna! Hey, what are you upto? Come out soon Are you sleeping inside? Kick open the door, man! Where do you think you're going? Cool cool! Excuse me, very urgent! Hey insane! Sorry guys! It was too urgent, okay? Thank you. Please. Where do you think you're going? Hey brother, I said sorry, no? What are you doing? I apologized! I'm sorry! Anna! - Those guys are going to beat me up! - Sit down Hey brother, no! Do something, Anna! Please! I said sorry! What? Hey brother, no! No issues, no fighting. Already said sorry to them! - Already said sorry to them! - Is it a joke? Anna! I told you I said sorry, ah! Anna, let's leave. This is Goa. What if they are mafia or something? Let's have another drink. You are unbelievable! They ran in all directions! [laughing] They got a thrashing! I love you, Anna! Hey! Kichu! C'mon, my man! - Come on! - Hey! - Kichu - [Kichu slurring] The sea is a lovely... - and we are so deadly! - Kichu stop! Kichu, be careful! [Kichu screaming] - Hey! - [Kichu screaming] Kichu, what are you doing! - [Kichu slurring] - Get up! Come on! - Anna, you are just awesome! - Keep walking. You are killer, man! Killer! Come with me. I love you, man! I love you! Alright, I get it. I love you! - Where are we going next? - Sit down! Get up Okay...okay. I love you! Anna! Woo! Anna! Anna! Hey! Dawood! What did you just call me? Dawood! That dead guy.... Assainar... Isn't that what he used to call you? Dawood! Huh? 30 crores of gold... - What did you just say? - Huh? What did you just say? Kichu, what did you just say? What did you say? [yawns] I am guessing this is your spot. One loud bark.. at least a lick... I would have woken up. You can lie down here. [Kichu] Ah... He's up and running already! What a tank! Anna! Let me freshen up. Here. You wont get your bun maskas here. Oh but vada pavs... You get that everywhere! I wonder if you get it in Sweden though. Let’s hope so! This is why I don't want to leave. But I have to. Kallu will have a future there. Chacha is getting old too. It's only fair that I take care of him now. What does your Chacha do exactly? Some shady businesses. He doesn't really open up. He thinks I am still a kid. Have your food, Anna. We need to leave. We can get to Mangalore if we hustle. Or maybe Udupi. They have the most amazing masala dosa. What do you think? Udupi and masala dosa? Works for you? Hmm. I'll get the tea. Hungover, Anna? You had a blast yesterday! Both kinds. This. And this! Who's Dawood? Who? Assainar? So you have started remembering? You said these names when you were drunk yesterday. I did? Who are you? Quickly! Who are you? What am I supposed to say, Anna? Answer me without thinking up lies. Who are you? [Kichu mumbles] What do you expect me to say if you ask me who I am. Then why did you come searching for me. Came searching? Fine, I will tell you the truth. Uh... Remember we went to that ice cream store in Chowpatty beach...were you get the green chili flavor. I ran into an old friend there. You probably don't remember. He works with a newspaper...a reporter. He asked me...if the man he saw with me was David. I said yeah... And that’s when he told me...that there was this big businessman called Assainar. He was good friends with you... but he died. and that he had a nickname for you... Dawood. Guess I blurted out all this when I was drunk. I can't hold my alcohol at all. - But you, Anna,.. - Let's leave. [in Hindi] Do you have alcohol inside? [in Hindi] Ah..okay, okay. [in Hindi] What are you looking at? Hey, Sawant! [in Hindi] Step aside! Sorry...extremely sorry! [in Hindi] You can go. [in Hindi]Open the gates! Quickly! [Kichu] I guess you've taken this route before. I don't know! I don't know! You tell me if you know. Or you ask your friend and then tell me! [Kichu's distorted voice] He was a reporter. [Kichu's distorted voice] A man named David... [Kichu's distorted voice] I'll be honest! [Kichu's distorted voice] and that he had a nickname for you... Dawood. [Kichu's distorted voice] [Kichu's distorted voice] that there was this big businessman called Assainar. [Kichu's distorted voice] What is your friend's name? Eh? The reporter. Turn the car around. We are going back to Bombay. I need to see this man. How can we go back now? We have come so far. We have to! I need to talk to him. If we push, we can get there tomorrow morning give them the vehicle. We don't need to stick around. We will get the first train out and come back. I'll be in trouble if I don't get the car there. Call him then. I want to talk to him. I don't have his number. Then turn the car around. Let me try to get his number from someone else. [Kichu] There's no signal here... Let me step out and check. [Kichu] Kallu? I think he is starting to remember things… But I don’t think I will be alive to collect the money. He is not the person we knew. He is like a wild animal now. I should have listened to you. I shouldn't have set out for this. Kallu? I love you. I love you! I need to take a leak. That journalist friend of yours... [stutters] I haven't gotten his number yet. Did he tell you that Assainar is dead? [stuttering] That's what I remember... What happened? Assainar is not dead. What? I am Assainar. Who is the man I am with? Who is this man you have sent me with? What? What is up with you? He says he is the dead Assainar! Tell me! Who is he? Did he say this? No, I dreamt it up! Tell me the truth! Kichu, you did it! Did what? What else did Assainar say? [woman on phone] Did he say anything about the gold? So the man I am with is Assainar? Kichu, listen to me! I don't want to hear anything! This is going to get me killed. The man who's sitting in that car... He can kill half a dozen people by himself! You tricked me! Kichu, please, you have to calm down. Look. You won. We won! You have done what nobody else could. It was David who was killed in that ambush. But when Assainar regained consciousness he began to say that he is David. Maybe something happened to his memory. The doctors say that maybe his mind is unwilling to accept that David died. Screw the doctors! Why didn't you tell me the truth when you gave me the job. Kichu... Had I told you to befriend someone like Assainar, wouldn't you have panicked like you are doing now. Try to understand. She had told me not to take this up! Your Chaacha has told us how you took this up because you want to move to Sweden with the girl you love. We'll get you not twenty five, but thirty five lakhs! And we will get you both resident permits there. But you have to get Assainar to Udupi....to where the incident happened. We need to know who attacked him that day. ...and what happened to the gold. Just one more clue. Please, Kichu. Kichu? What happened? Tell me! What happened? The man I am with... is it the dead Assainar? You could have told me, Chaacha. They did not let me. They said you'll back out and forced me not to tell you. But still, Chaacha... Forgive me...come back home. Enough of this. We will find the money somehow. Come back home. No. The money is sorted. I'll get an extra ten lakhs. They will take care of the visa too. I have come this far. I have decided to take him to that shootout spot in Uduppi. [Chaacha] Kichu? I will call you, Chaacha. Did you get the journalist? I was just talking to Kallu ...letting her know. She was really happy to hear this. This will all become clear soon. Anna.. I mean sir...stay strong. I'm here with you. We'll have a tea? Uh. Two... What a strange place. Why are you so silent, sir? Are you reminded of anything from your past? What about you? Are you reminded of anything... Dawood? What did you call me? Your memory is hiding out here somewhere. If only you could dig it out like you dig for water in a well. Right? Anna, has this memory thing made you crazy? In a way, I am crazy. I am crazy that I have been waiting so long for your memory to come back. And then I put up this drama. I swear it was all an act. I got into this mess only because I needed the money. I swear to God I don't know what you are talking about, Anna! Is that the truth? It is. Something is wrong here. Someone is trying to set us up. Please? Let me leave. Right before I killed them, when Adiga's thugs squealed that it was you who set me up it hurt like my heart was being torn open, Dawood! No matter what, there's one thing the mind will never forget. betraying someone who loved you, trusted you like a sibling. That is why we have waited so long...in the hope that you yourself will remember everything...and admit to them. Perhaps it never happened because you never understood my love for you. Is it, you dog? Tell me, why did you betray me? It was not for money. It wasn't to take over my position. It's something else. Tell me! Tell me, Dawood! I don't know! I am Kichu. Kichu! [Kichu sobbing] I have to repay this treat! When do you get off, Anna? Come with me, Anna. Please! We can see home! [Kichu sobbing] Anna! These are the people who put me up to this! I swear I don't know! I don't! Please. You have to believe me! Anna, please! David's time has come. Tell them, Chaacha! He'll believe you! Tell him she put me up to this! Tell him I don't know anything! Nothing, no one is what they seem. Kichu. Shall we head to Mangalore, Sreedharanda? - It is justice that we settle this there. - Hmm. Are we going in search of the thirty crores of gold? What gold? If I am who you say I am... then, who's Kichu? Perhaps your dream. A dream to lead a normal life. a dream from which you cannot.... or you don't want to wake up from. Have you started remembering? Dawood? He's not anyone's type! Dawood? [Old man] Assainar's beating heart. Have you started remembering? Dawood? [woman] The kingpin of gold smuggling Have you started remembering? Dawood? I am Assainar. Have you started remembering? Why did you betray me? - Tell me, Dawood! Assu! Welcome! I have some lovely fish here. Sreedharanda! Come! Come, take a seat! Really, Assu? Even now? Is he still carrying you around alive, Dawood? [Adiga laughs] That's good. Hi! So Shall I... pour you one? I hope this is still the same. This kid had just turned sixteen or seventeen he said he wants a beer and made a fuss about it. And we took him to that dance bar remember? Matunga... or was it Powai? Chembur. Ah! Chembur! [laughs] Though he didn't like the taste of beer he did take a liking to a few other things there. In the end Sreedharandha had to drag him out of there. Do you remember, Sreedharanda how this boy was? Assu here can't look into your eyes while he kills you. You have to stare into one's face when you kill them. That's where the thrill is! When I came to know that you took those bullets... and still didn't die I was sad that I lost to you again. Then I thought about it. I realised I had actually won. Him. Your heart! The moment he fell into my hands didn't you lose? That very moment didn't you die, Assainar? Do you still not remember? Sir? I...[pauses] What was it that I used to call you? Annan. [softly] Annan. One doesn't need to lose their memory to forget someone, do they? Can I ask you one thing? Am I really David? The moment David has the slightest idea who he is... no one will be able to touch him! I'm sure! Promise me, David that the man I call my husband, will be no more. You have my word. Assainar will not come back alive from Mangalore this time. [in Hindi] Now let's see who can stop me. "Darkness around me with nothing to quench my thirst." " A song from the folklore. Weighed down by what's inside. " " How convoluted are my thoughts. When will this fog clear?" " You blink for a moment and friends turn to foes. " " Who do we trust? Who stands shoulder to shoulder?"
