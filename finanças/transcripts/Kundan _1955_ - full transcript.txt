Give me the bread. Yes sir. I stole it. But my niece was starving. My sister was suffering from a disease. I had no money. I wanted to work but nobody hired me. I asked for a loan but nobody lent me money. I even begged fo money. But nobody took pity on me. And then, then... I couldn't control myself. You have committed theft and you've confessed it. Therefore this court gives you two years rigorous imprisonment. Uncle, uncle. Hey child. Don't scream. Talk slowly. Uncle. Mother hasn't even opened her eyes since yesterday. She neither talks nor asks for water. The water pot is broken, too. There's no oil left in the lamp. Uncle, what are you doing here? Come home. Don't cry child. Brave children don't cry. Go. You go home. - I'll come behind you. - Really! Yes. And when I come, I'll bring a new water pot. And oil for the lamp. And medicine for your mother. - Then it will be fun. - Yes. For sure. Now run. Run home. 'Mother hasn't even opened her eyes since yesterday.' 'She neither talks nor asks for water.' 'Mother hasn't even opened her eyes since yesterday.' 'She neither talks nor asks for water.' You're a very dangerous prisoner. You've tried to escape. You get 5 years more. You attacked the warden. And tried to escape twice. A prisoner like you should be put in shackles. Seven more years imprisonment. A total of 14 years. Friend. If you hadn't been here today... Bhiku's life would have been in danger. How could that be? God has strange ways of saving us. Maybe God sent Kundan to prison just for this. - You're right. - Move on. Go to your place and start working. Kundan. I'm happy that you did your duty. 'This way, by carrying loads, breaking stones...' 'and grinding grain, Kundan spent 12 years of his term.' 'But in those 12 years he didn't pass a single day...' 'without remembering his niece Radha.' 'He always used to wonder where she'd be...' 'how she'd be and what she'd be doing.' The apple of my eye, and love of my heart I sacrifice everything for you The apple of my eye, and love of my heart I sacrifice everything for you My eyes are your bed And my heart is your sheet All my hopes are with you. You are my toys Morning and night my heart says only one thing I sacrifice everything for you Moon of the night and sun of the day They rise and set every day In this world, my dear, you live even my life You must spend beautiful and lovely days forever I sacrifice everything for you The apple of my eye, and love of my heart I sacrifice everything for you You won't return home before making your Radha... wait for you for a long time. My dear, I offend you because I like to appease you later. Look. What's this? Even a queen of fairies won't be so beautiful. Stop it! You always try to fool me... Oh God! It is said that when a photo breaks... then the destiny shatters too. It's just your superstition. Is Mr. Gopal in? Wait brother, I'm coming. Get ready quickly. Today your husband... will take you to a drama, 'Hunting innocent.' Very great. Did you explain everything to him? Yes. Perfectly. Now I'll wait for you at the house of that beautiful girl. Now let's start our drama, 'Hunting innocent.' Look Mr. Gopal. Don't be angry or it... won't be good for you. If you're really a man of reputation, then give me my money. I'll leave now. You've borrowed 10,000 rupees from me... and when I ask for it you only stare at me. But today I won't leave without the money. Can't you see? I've brought police. But sir. Please speak quietly. Why should I speak quietly? Did I commit theft? I've given you money. And in cash. I'm not denying it. But I don't have the money right now. If you don't have money, sell your things. Sell your wife's jewelry. Look sir. Say whatever you want to me... but if you mention my wife's name again... I'll break your head. Oh, I've seen many violent people like you. Just now I only spoke about your wife's jewelry... - but if I don't get money... - You did it again. - I'll strangle you. - What are you doing? Police! Police! Take this, sir. Here's my jewelry. Sell it and recover your money. But please don't hurt him. Why are you giving it to this fraud thief? Come with me you scoundrel. - I'll take revenge in good time. - Alright. Alright. - You can try. - Scoundrel. Come to my hotel, sir... and drink hot tea and eat soft biscuits We have everything you want, I swear on God Come to my hotel If you're feeling hot, then have a cold drink... and cool yourself, sir If you're getting cold, then eat an egg, brother Come in this hotel, sir, and take on a new life Come to my hotel, sir... and drink hot tea and eat soft biscuits We have everything you want, I swear on God Come to my hotel Ask me how both of us will profit, oh customer You'll have food in your mouth... and we'll have money in our pockets This world respects those who have money Come to my hotel, sir... and drink hot tea and eat soft biscuits We have everything you want, I swear on God Come to my hotel... and drink hot tea and eat soft biscuits We have everything you want, I swear on God Come to my hotel Number 335, today your prison term is complete. Today you are released. But remember. For one year, you'll... have to report to a nearby police station every day. During the second year, it'll be once a month. And then once a year. But don't forget one thing. If you fail to report to... a police station even once, then you'll be arrested. You may go now. Sir. A man named Kundan used to live here. Kundan? Kudan, yes, yes. But he's been in prison for many years. And his sister. She died many years ago. She actually got relief from all her pains. Sir. And his niece? I don't know that. - But who are you? - I'm their relative. You're Kundan. Kundan. Kundan, the prisoner. Kundan, the thief. Listen. Today a dangerous criminal came here from prison. Don't go out wearing your jewelry. Did you hear this? Today a criminal came here... - after breaking out of prison. - Criminal? Be careful saint. Today a murderer has come here. He's killed many and robbed many. Radha! Where are you, Radha! Hey Ratna. Are you going to play the whole day? Come. It's time to eat. Are these chldren yours, sister? One is mine. Her name is Ratna. Other belongs to a rich man. His wife died... so he left him with me for a month. I take great care of him. But why do you ask? I was thinking, if you can take care of my girl... then I can get a job without any worries. Why? What happened to her father that you... have to work in this age? God knows what happened. One day he took all my clothes, money, jewelriy... and went somewhere. He left me alone in big trouble. It's been two years, sister. There's no news of him. God will punish him. It's the nature of these men. And what's the nature of women, Sukhiya? This is my husband Jokho. He's one in a million. I'm very poor and sad, sister. Look after my daughter. I'll be obliged. Sukhiya. Do this favor for her. She'll be grateful. I'll do this favor for her. But first let me find out what she can do for us. I'll give you 15 rupees every month. 15 rupees? I'm sorry. Even a puppy can't be kept for 15 rupees. Alright. I'll give you 20 rupees. No dear, no. It's not enough. Then it's very difficult for me. Shame! Today you've become merciless, Sukhiya. You're not helping a poor girl. Shame! Shame! Accept it. Let her give 20 rupees. If you spend 2-4 rupees more on the girl in a month... then I'll pay for it. Alright. Then it's a deal. God bless you. But you'll have to pay extra for clothes and medicine. - Alright. - And 3 months advance. - And admission fee? - She can give whatever she likes. I'll give you 5 rupees for admission. Only 5! That rich man gave me 100 rupees. I won't mind if the money is a little less than that. These are my earrings. They're worth 100 rupees. 100 rupees! But I don't think they're pure gold. They won't sell for even 60 rupees. Sukhiya, the admission fee is still left. I'm giving you 5 rupees admission fee. Give. Come, now give her your blessing. She'll be pleasd. I would have given her my blessings even without this deal. - What's your name? - Radha. - And the girl's name? - She's Uma. God bless you, Radha, and you Umi. Go. Give her your love. And put 10-20 rupees in her hand. If I go to hug her, she won't leave me. And I don't have anything to give her. Shame! Shame! Shame! She didn't give any money to the child. She's just a heartless woman. Shame! Come. Food. Bring food. Hey wait. Take the food back. - You won't get food. - Why? I have money. Money earned in prison. Get out of here. Are you leaving or not? Brother. Oh Brother! I didn't recognize. Which brother you are? I'm hungry and tired. I need a place to spend the night. This isn't a hotel. Alright. At least give me a glass of water. It's about to rain. You'll get plenty of water. Who are you? Get out. Can't you see the dog's getting drenched? Come! Come out! Come out. You can't sleep here. Brother. Why are you sitting here getting drenched? A person for whom this world has no food, no shelter... no sweet words, if such a person is getting soaked... what's it to you?? Don't be angry, brother. Why don't you go to a hotel? I've been to many places. But... Now don't get on my nerves, I'm very tired. - Did you go to that house? - o. Then go there now. You'll surely find a place to stay. Brother, did you hear what Khubiya said? I heard some things from here and there. What is it, Khubiya? Sir, the sister was saying... I think whatever brother does, is right. Alright madam. I'll speak To keep the door always open isn't the proper thing I heard a dangerous prisoner has been released. And he's searching for prey. Come inside brother. I'm not your brother. I'm a prisoner. After serving a sentence of 14 years... I was released 2 days ago. I have neither eaten anything nor slept. I went to many places. But nobody helped me. I wasn't even allowed to sleep with a dog. Now tell me, are you giving me shelter here or not? If not, then say so. I'll leave before listening to anything else. - First come inside, sir. - Sir. You called me sir. But the world only offers me insults. It seems society has treated you unjustly. Society sometimes becomes blind. Come. Sit beside the fire. You look very tired. Khubiya, go and tell the chef we have a guest today. He'll eat dinner with us. Prepare for an additional person. Khubiya, why didn't you bring out the silver platters today? We have a guest today. We should serve him as a guest. A guest is like a God. And you didn't even use the silver lamps for our God. What's happened to you today, Khubiya? Make a bed for him in the room next to mine. No, no, I don't need a room. If you have a barn, then I can sleep there. Humans don't sleep in barns like animals. But this world thinks I'm an animal. A human who thinks of other humans as animals is himself an animal. Come, I'll show you your room. This is your bed. It's not good enough. But I hope you... Don't worry about it. For many years I've slept on rocks. Alright, you can rest now. Please listen. How can you be so sure... I won't strangle you in the dead of night? The same way you know I won't strangle you. Remember my friend... we should give life, not take it. Oh my God! - Maharaj, Maharaj... - What is it, Khubiya? Why are you screaming? What else can I do if not shout? You let in whoever shows up. Now see for yourself. Last night you gave shelter to that ruffian... and he stole all the silver. We can manage even without the silver. The man who took it probably needed it more than we do. Come inside, brother. You! My brother, you. It's very nice to see you again. But why did you arrest him. We found this silver on him. - And he says that... - I gave it to him. - Yes, sir. Why didn't you take the silver lamps? These're yours too. So, he didn't steal. We're sorry. We made a mistake. Come to your senses, fool devotee God is watching us from above He knows all our deeds Recognize him Don't commit a crime in the world out of ignorance Show this world that you're a good human A good human Don't commit a crime in the world out of ignorance Get up and change the course of your life If you want to reach your destination then change your ways Move ahead and become a storm of welfare Don't commit a crime in the world out of ignorance For how long will you... for how long will you keep repenting? The game of destiny will go on Remove this poverty by becoming powerful Don't commit a crime in the world out of ignorance What are you seeing, sir? I'm seeing that the mud trampled by feet... can be used to make such beautiful things. You really said it very artfully. You look like a visitor. Yes. But if you people do me a favor, I'll settle here. - What do you mean? - I mean I want to work here. Then buy this place. I want to sell it. You'll get water ands soil, with a city nearby. But remember one thing. Do you have money? Yes, I have the money. From today, this place is yours. Din Dayal Crockery Works. Din Dayal Hermitage. Din Dayal Orphanage. Din Dayal High School. Din Dayal Hospital. Scholar. In these 5 years, our village has changed for the better. There's no doubt about it My son used to walk 10 Km... to school every day. There wasn't a good dispensary in the village. No doubt about it. Din Dayal Hospital must have saved many lives. Yes sir. But for widows and orphans... Din Dayal is no less than a God. Today people think of me as a God and a Saint. But this is all because of your mercy teacher. Today, the prisoner Kundan has become businessman Din Dayal. Greetings Sir Din Dayal. - Greetings. - Greetings. Take a seat. Tell me, what can I do for you? - Sir, we've all come with a request. - Tell me. You must know our village has grown into a city. And now there'll be an election for our first Mayor. And it's our earnest desire that you become our first Mayor. The thing is, this is a post with huge responsibilities. Maybe I won't be able to give enough time and attention to it If it happens, then I'd feel very bad. We came here with big hopes. This isn't just our wish but the wish of the entire city. I have full confidence you won't refuse us. Please agree to it. And sign it. This is your view too? There's no doubt about it. The post of Mayor, and Magistrate too. This is really the biggest honor one can achieve Who is this Din Dayal? I heard he came here as an ordinary man. With passage of time he's become a millionaire. - Where is he from? - No one knows that. I tried, but couldn't learn anything. Alright, now that he's both Mayor Magistrate... it becomes very important for me to meet him. Sir, someone is here to see you. I told him many times to meet you in the office. But he's not listening. No problem. Let him come. - Sevakram. I'll go over the rest of the papers later. - Okay. I'm lnspector Sher Singh. Yesterday, I was transferred here. I came to congratulate you. Thank you inspector. I'm pleased to meet you. You've been appointed to the post of Magistrate... along with the post of Mayor. We'll meet often on business. - Not so often, I think. - Why? Because most of the people here are good and honest. You'll find peace and harmony everywhere in this city. Sir, but there is always shadow with light. So you always cast your eyes on the dark side of events. It's my duty to keep an eye on crime, sir. But it's not your duty to ignore the causes of crime. It's possible that what you think of as crime... could be the helplessness of a destitute man. If we think of fire as ice, it still doesn't become cold. Thieves, dacoits and robbers are the enemies of peace and harmony. It's impossible to get the fragrance of flowers from soil. Don't say that inspector. People can make insense even from soil. No one is a criminal by birth. It's possible that today's criminal can become tomorrow's honest citizen. But it's important for you that, instead of punishing him blindly... you look upon his crime with mercy and humanity. There is an honest blood running through your body. You've never committed a crime. Neither are you in the police department. Therefore you want to rehabilitate the criminals with mercy and compassion. But it's my experience that thieves, dacoits and robbers... don't recognize kindness. They understand the language of punishment. Those who only understand the language of punishment... aren't humans but demons. And if we change a human into a demon then it's... not his but our fault. Your opinions are interesting, Mr. Mayor. But still I'll say that a law is a law. And violators must be punished. I'm not an astrologer, inspector... but still I can see the day when this life of yours... molded by law, will be forced to look at a crime with mercy and compassion. Mr. Mayor, the day this weakness enters my heart... and the day my feet get shakey from the path of law... that day will be the last day of my life. Move aside. Move aside. Save me! Radha, where are you going at this hour? Sister, when someone is leaving for work... you shouldn't interrupt them. It brings bad luck. What? Bad luck! I don't know why she's so proud? She's proud of her beauty and youth. Sister, everyone gets beauty and youth... but she's not down to earth. And she dputs on much makeup. Did you see that? She not only uses makeup... but I heard this spinster writes long letters day and night. Now just think what she must be writing... and to whom she's writing. The truth is she has a daughter. She doesn't live with her but some nanny. And this queen, she hides this fact. Oh God! She has a daughter without getting married? If we work with such an immoral woman... then we too will become infamous. Let's go tell the manager we won't work with her. Yes, yes. Let's go. What has she sent this time? Just 20 rupees. Nothing else. What's this? A sweater for Umi. The ways of God are strange. She doesn't deserve this expensive stuff. - But what can we do? - We can do everything. - Ratna. Oh Ratna! - Mother, speak quietly. I'm not deaf. - See what's come for you? - Oh mother. - Who brought this? - We brought it. Who else? Wear it and become like a doll. - And mother, what about Umi. - Let her stay as she is Umi? Oh Umi. Mother, she doesn't have a single nice dress. Why are you staring like that? Remove your evil eyes from our girl. You go and play. You! Did you fetch water? Wash the dishes? Sweep the floor? - Washed my clothes? - I'll do it mother. Did you forget yesterday's beating? Get out of here. Go and do your work. She's a strange girl. She's a problem on us. Dear, what are you thinking? I was thinking the body is small and stomach is big. - Mind your tongue. - I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about that witch, Umi. She eats kilos of grains at one time without belching. - But what can we do now? - We have to think about it. Look Sukhiya. I'll write a letter to her mother... that she either send 40 rupees now or... she can come and take her daughter. We can't raise her on these 20 rupees. If she really takes back her daughter, then who'll do all the house work? Yes, you're right. You're a queen and I'm a king. How can we both work? I won't write a letter. You don't have a brain. Write it so that we don't lose the girl... and get more money. Understand? Yes. I understood. That I'm a fool. You should have become a Jokho. I'll write such a letter to her mother that she'll send the money soon. After we get the money I'll buy a nice nose-ring for you. After putting it on you sit in front of me... and I'll sing a Punjabi song for you. Greetings Mr. Manager. Did you call me? Yes, Radha. The thing is, the other girls have complained about you. - Complain? - Yes. They say you have a daughter. Is it true? - Yes sir. - But you told me you're unmarried. - I lied to you. - Why? Because my husband left my daughter and me... in trouble forever. When I searched for jobs... people would say I had a child and can't work. So I thought, maybe you'd refuse, too. I was scared. I wrote that I was unmarried. You did something wrong. But listen to me. I, I... You're disgraced in this factory. The girls are saying if you work here... then they'll all quit their jobs. This is your one month's salary and this is your bonus. I'm sorry. I can't do anything else. Umi! Umi! Where are you? I'm coming. I've been screaming for 2 hours. And you've bgrown deaf. Oh. So you spilled the rice. Stupid. Were your arms broken or your eyes blinded? - I stumbled, mother. - Stumbled, mother! What else can happen to you? You eat two kilos of food at a time, God know which demon resides in your stomach. Mother. I eat as much as you give me. Shame on you! You've started answering me back. Go and start the stove. The wood is wet, mother. I'm telling you to light the fire, or else I'll burn you today. Oh! Today the queen remembered the huts of the poor people. Are you lost? How is my daughter? She's fine. Her hands, legs, ears, eyes, everything where it should be. Call her, sister. I'm craving to see her. Oh, now you show up, talking about loving your daughter. You show love but never any money. I've said many times the expenses have increased, send 40 rupees. But you never paid any heed to it. You only sent the same 20 rupees But now 20 rupees isn't enough. Listen to me. I don't have a job. I can't even pay 20 rupees. Now sister, I'll take her along with me. Alright. So you have come to take her. Dear. Listen to me. Come here. I'm here. What's the matter? She's Umi's mother. She wants to take her child back. Send her. Surely send her. Sent her happily. Sent her now. Get rid of the problem. But we've spent for her medicine and clothes around 500 rupees. She should first pay us back and then take the girl. - 500? - Yes. But I don't have even 5 paisa. You've thought about the girl but not the loan. First give us 500 rupees and then you can see the girl. - If you pocket is empty then - you can go home. If you leave, then remember I'm a very wicked man. - I'll show you no mercy. - What are you looking at? Move on. Are you listening? I said get out of here. There's no one to admire your beauty. Go away. You won't listen like this. Get out of here. Get out. Uma! Uma! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! My child. My child. - My child. - Mother, I'm coming. - Mother. - My child. - Mother. - Where are you going? Daughter and mother! Get in. - Mother! - Get inside. Will you get up or not? - Mother. - Shut up. Shut up, mother's little darling. Stay put. Oh God! Why did you send us into this world? You gave us poverty and ignored us You haven't provided justice for us, oh God! I don't complain about my life being ruined I'm helpless and can't fight against my destiny You were right in breaking all my hopes, oh God. Don't bother about us. We've lived in misery... and we'll continue to live this way We have always suppressed our anger... and we'll continue to do that. But you have disgraced your own name in this world Oh God! Why did you send us in this word? O God! Take these Mr. Mehta. These are the keys to the room. - Where will you go now? - God knows. This is a cruel world, daughter. No matter how cruel this world is, it doesn't have... enough power to corrupt a pure soul. If you don't mind, may I say something to you? Yes, Mr. Mehta. If you really think you have such inner strength... then why not make use of your voice. God has given you a great voice. Nowadays, plays are popular everywhere. Join a theater group. You'll find good work there. Loverboy, oh loverboy, come fall in love Keep someone's love in your heart Loverboy, oh loverboy, come fall in love Keep someone's love in your heart You're a vagabond in this world Leave your mark here Get rid of all your worries and problems Laugh and make others laugh along Loverboy, oh loverboy, come fall in love Keep someone's love in your heart There is love in someone's life But in my life there is only suffering All are greedy for money. None bother about the poor This world is crazy. And the faces are pretty But the hearts are evil Loverboy, oh loverboy, come fall in love Keep someone's love in your heart I can also sing. Can I get a job here? If you can laugh, cry and show your grace... then you won't have to worry about jobs. Come inside. Take your seats. Sit down. Ladies and gentlemen. Please sit down. - You! - You? - Who are you? - You don't know me? You didn't recognize me? I'm sorry. I really don't recognize you. Please listen. Listen to me. - You say you don't know me. - You stay inside. You say you don't recognize me. You don't know me? You're my husband. You're my Umi's father. You put my life in darkness... by running away with all my clothes and jewelry. But now you're saying you don't recognize me. What's the matter sir? This lying woman is trying to cheat me. Cheater? I'm not a cheat but you are. You deceived me. You robbed me. Because of you I have to suffer pain. But I'm still ready to forgive all your sins. Please don't leave me. Don't leave me. Shameless. lmmoral woman leave me. You won't catch a husband like this. You called me a shameless, immoral woman. After performing all the marriage rituals... you accepted me as your wife. And now I won't leave you. I won't let you go. Either I'll bring you along or go with you. I'll take you along. I will take you along. I will take you along. What's the matter? This mad woman is falsely harassing... and defaming this gentleman. No inspector. I'm not mad. I'm not falsely... defaming him. I'm his wife. He left me alone, inspector. I found him today with great trouble... and now I won't leave him. I won't let him go. I won't leave him. Oh God! Oh God! The world has really changed. Now even women have started cheating like this. Inspector, I'm still unmarried. If you want, you an ask my manager. Inspector, this woman first attacked me. Now she's blaming our boss. - This woman is mad. - She wasn't made mad by a cheater. Number 2O3. Take this woman to the police station. No, no, lnspector I'm not mad. I'm not a cheater, inspector. I'm not a cheater, inspector. He's my husband. He's lying. I'm not mad. I'm not mad. Please believe me. I haven't done anything wrong. He's not a stranger. But he is my husband. He was my life partner, but he cheated me. He stole all my things. He didn't even leave my clothes and jewelry. He made my life a living hell... and I was going to make him aware of his crimes. I'm not an unscrupulous immoral woman. Why did you bring me here? Why did you bring me here? Because you took the law into your own hands... and troubled the civil people with your misdeeds. Take her and put her in prison tonight. I haven't troubled any stranger. If you don't believe me then you can call that man. If he still refuses then I'll apologize to him. But don't put me in prison. Please don't put me in prison. - Take her in. - No, no, Inspector Have mercy on me, inspector. My child will die inspector. They are very cruel, inspector. - I'm ill. - Let me go. Let me go Stop! You said 'stop'. I knew... I knew you were very kind. God bless you. God bless your children. God will give you a promotion, inspector. - May God grant you a long life. - Stop this nonsense and move aside. Come in Mr. Mayor. Alright. So this is the Mayor. He's the man whom people respected so much. - He's the man whom people think of as God. - Girl! Let her speak, inspector. I want to know if a husband deceives his wife, leaving her alone... if it's the wife's fault. If a wife gives birth to her husband's child... then is it the wife's crime? If such a woman works in your factory then will... it disgrace your name. And when she frantically searches for food then does it... boost your reputation? - No. - Then why fire me over claims I'm immoral and unscrupulous? Is this your justice? Is this your truth? People worship you thinking you're kind, just and merciful. But I spit on you because you're merciless, a liar and a fraud. - Insolent woman! - Let it be, inspector. The poor girl has lost her senses. Those who've lost their senses belong in prison. Take her away. Inspector, it's not her fault. Tlt's the fault of her pain. And her pain seems to be immense. - Release her. - But she spit on you. This is a personal matter. You can't interfere in it. This means you've forgiven her. Very good. But before this, she even had a fight with a gentleman. This girl is a danger to the peace. She'll be treated like a criminal. I've seen the deeds of that gentleman myself. I know this woman is innocent. She must be released. She might be innocent in your opinion... but not according to the Law. I'm not your servant, but the servant of the law, Mr. Mayor. If you're the servant of the law... then with the authority given to me by the same law... I order you to release this poor woman. I think you're unnecessarily interfering with the law. - I order you to release her. - Release her. You released me. Please forgive me. I insulted you. But you're a God. Guard! Bring this woman to my bungalow. This way I lost my uncle. This way my husband left me. This way I was fired from the factory. And I became homeless and helpless in this world. But why did the expression on your face change? The expression on my face didn't change, daughter. But my destiny has changed. Look carefully and try to see the face of your uncle in my face. Is your uncle Kundan standing before you? Uncle. Radha. Radha my daughter. You don't know how many days I've spent in misery. I've spent many dark nights of pain in my life. I don't know what God wants. God wants you to get well now and live comfortably... and luxuriously in my house. And I shouldn't see tears in you eyes again. Uncle, this will only be possible after you bring my daughter to me. Alright, you sit here. Take and sign this paper. Trust me. Your daughter will be sitting in your lap soon. And then all the days of our lives will be happy ones. Sir. lnspector Sher Singh has come to see you. Alright nurse. Take care of Radha. Inspector Sher Singh. Sit down. Forgive me. I haven't come this time to sit. So you want me to stand too? I want you to fire me from my job, now. Fire you? Why? I have reported against you that... That I've starte interfering with the police work? No. I reported that you're an old prisoner, Kundan. Kundan? Who's Kundan? A prisoner who was very strong. One day he saved the life of a prisoner the same way... you saved the life of Garibdas. I became suspicious and reported you were Kundan. Inspector. What was the crime of that prisoner? After serving a term of 14 years in prison... he was ordered to report to the police station everyday. But he never reported and now he's a criminal again. And it's my duty to arrest him. How did your superiors reply? To arrest your Mayor? My superiors replied that I was mad. The real Kundan has already been arrested. Tomorrow he goes to court. I have to go there to give witness How can this be possible? One Kundan is here free... and some other Kundan has been arrested there. I've done wrong by insulting you and... reporting against you without thinking. You should dismiss me from this job... as punishment for this betrayal. You haven't cimmitted any crime. But you only made a mistake. And I don't punish mistakes. Even if it's my mistake... I don't want you to go without punishing me. If you don't dismiss me then I'll have to resign. I'll think about it later, whether to accept your resignation or not. Right now, go and do your work. And help the law to punish the Kundan who was arrested. Have to committed any crime? Sir, I'm a poor old man. How can I commit a crime? Didn't you jump over the garden wall to pluck apples? Sir, the apples were on the ground and outside. I picked it up. I didn't enter the garden. - Alright Kundan... - Lawyer, my name isn't Kundan. Then what's your name? When I was small my mother used to call me Chotka (small). When I was fat, my friends called me Motka (Fatty). And now that I'm old the world calls me Bodahu (oldie). Now you may decide my name, sir. Order, Order. My Lord, the convict is lying. - Give me permission to present witnesses. - The court gives you permission. The first witness is Sher Singh, inspector of police. When the convict was in prison... and today's witness was a prisoner then, I was the prison superintendent. Therefore, I request this court call me as the final witness... so there won't be any influence on the other witnesses... or any chance of injustice being committed against the convict. Very commendable, indeed. - Second witness. - Maiku Vald Fakira. Look at the convict and tell us if you've seen him before. Yes sir, I've seen him before. He was with us in prison. His name is Kundan. - Next. If Fattu. Do you know this man? I know him very well, sir. He's our prison brother, Kundan. When he was in prison, we were very close, sir. - Next. - Parsa Jaggu. Look at him and tell us if you recognize him. Why not sir? This is our Kundan. This court feels there's no need for further witnesses. Convict, what do you want to say now? Sir, I'm not Kundan. But if these people say I am, I don't mind being called Kundan. The court has decided, since you never reported to the police station even once... after being released, it's your first crime. - And you jumped the garden wall... - Wait, Judge. Who? Mr. Mayor. Come. I apologize for interrupting, judge. I request the court give me a chance to speak... - before giving the verdict. - Sure, sure. Bring a chair for the Mayor. I thank the court. But I want permission to speak standing up. As you wish. Tell us, what do you want to say? I request the court release this man... who's being held on suspicion of being Kundan. He isn't Kundan. I'm Kundan. I've broken the law. And if the law is searching for Kundan... then it should arrest me. My lord. I request that this court, before recording his statement... have him checked by a doctor. I think he's lost his mind. Trust me lawyer. I haven't lost my mind. I'm saying this while completely sane. And I know the consequences of this. Believe me. Right now, standing before you is the same poor innocent Kundan... who used to earn money cutting wood. And who was in your prison... for 14 years for stealing bread. And after serving such a harsh punishment for such a petty crime... when he was released the merciless and hard law didn't stop chasing him. And society, too, treated him worse than animals. All the people he approached avoided him. And all the houses were closed to him. Now Kundan had no other option but to steal again. While he was struggling with this thought... a great man welcomed him with open heart. That great man fed him with love and gave him shelter. The work which the 14 years imprisonment should have accomplished... was done by this loving act. And Kundan again became the same old innocent Kundan. But if the law decides Kundan has committed a crime... by not reporting to the police station... and that he should be punished for it... then tell the law to arrest me instead of this innocent man. I confess to my crime. This court still doubts your statement. So, I will clear the court's doubts. This is Maiku, this is Masita and this is Parsa. And I was with them in prison and not this man. Show the tattoo mark on your left arm Maiku. You forgot me Masita, but I didn't forget the whip scars on your back And Parsa, show the wound mark from the rock... on your right hand to this court. Does the court still doubt my statement? Does the lawyer still think I've lost my mind? Or is this the effect of my name and position... that not a single hand has the courage to move against me? No matte, but I've done my duty. Now the court should do its duty and release this innocent man. Or else justice will be disgraced. And the law will repent its helplessness. He's innocent. Release him. Don't kill me with these medicines. My medicine is my daughter, Uma. After Uma comes, I'll get better. There's no use living without her. If sir has gone to get your daughter... then he'll surely return with her. Take and drink the medicine. You'll sleep well. Great, nurse. I'll be meeting my daughter after a long time... and you want to put me to sleep. I think you're not a mother and you don't have children. Uncle. Nurse, you may go. Uncle. Uncle, where's my Uma? Don't worry Radha. Your daughter will be here soon. But when? I think I'll die before seeing her. Uncle, uncle. You were saying that... This demon is back again. Save me uncle. He's here to take me. Drive him out. He'll arrest me again. Uncle he'll arrest me again. Don't worry child. He hasn't come to arrest you. - Sher Singh. - Inspector Sher Singh. - I know why you've come. - So come immediately. But first, may I speak with you alone? I don't like to listen that way. - Whatever you have to say, say it here. - lnspector... just give me two days time. So I can return her daughter to her. - After that... - It's not my duty to help you return her daughter. - My duty is to arrest you. - Please lnspector. He's come to arrest you? He'll take you away? I'll again have to wander from place to place. Uncle, my daughter will be in the hands... of those devils. She'll die in pain. Oh God! Oh God! Radha! You died before meeting your daughter. You merciless butcher. If you had listened to me alone, then... what harm would it have done to your law? You're merciless! You should have at least thought... that the person who saved an innocent man from going... to prison by sacrificing his reputation, honor... and wealth and confessed to his crime... in front of the whole court, would that man... have ran away to avoid arrest? I don't know anything. You come with me. I promised her I'd bring her daughter home. She's dead now. But my promise isn't dead. I won't come with you without fulfilling my promise. And I won't move from here without arresting you. Sher Singh, don't come any closer. You have again aroused the same old Kundan that was dead. That Kundan not only knows how to save others... but also how to kill. And there's the dead body of his niece lying in front of him. Sher Singh. I say, don't come any closer. I'm furious now. I don't know what I'll do. Sher Singh, don't come any closer. Sevakram! Time has come for this Kundan to run again. You'll have to take care of everything now. You have to arrange for Radha's funeral. - Sir, don't worry. - I'll give you my address later. - Where did he go? - I don't know. And even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. My dear don't give betel leaf to strangers Don't make my hopeful heart jealous Go dear, don't bother me unnecessarily If your pocket is empty, then don't come to the market Don't come here, dear You are innocent, dear You are innocent and don't know what love is If love is true then there's no need for money Don't hurt my feelings by asking for money Don't make my hopeful heart jealous In this world no one is loyal Nowadays love is sold for a few rupees Don't sing love songs to me If your pocket is empty then don't come to the market Don't come here, dear My dear don't give betel leaf to strangers If your pocket is empty then don't come to the market Don't come here, dear Why are you lifting such a big bucket, daughter? What else can I do? She beats me up. Give. I'll carry this. No, she'll ask if my hands are broken. No one will say that, daughter. - What's your name? - Uma. Uma! Come. Is your name Jokho? Call me Jokhoram. Jokhoram. Tell me, what can I do for you? Uma's mother sent me here. I've come to take her. Oh, Ratna's mother. Look. A gentleman has come now to take Umi. If he's come to take Umi, then he can take her. But first he should pay us our money. Then he should look at her. This is called justice. Brother, first give us her expenses. Don't worry about the money. I'll give you that. Tell me, how much do I owe you? Gentleman, why are you standing there? Come and sit here. Sit here. This is your own house. Sit down. What are you staring at Umi's mother? Go and bring tea for sir. And special betel leaf. This one's no good. First tell me your expenses. It's not much. Just 40 and 40 is 80. And that 3OO. Yes. I forgot about that. She knows the accounts better than I. And that makes it a total of 38O rupees. And the expense of medicine 6O rupees. That was for the other illness. And the 150 rupees we had to pay during her first illness... - did you forget that? - I did forget that. During her first illness we spent 15O rupees. So 15O and 6O and 38O. This makes the total... 590. Enough? Enough. Not enough, Umi's mother. That 100 rupees spent on clothes... - who pays? - Yes. Alright. Add the 100 rupees for clothes too. - It is 690 rupees. - Yes, 690 rupees. Here's 700 rupees. - I don't have 10 rupees change. - No problem. - Daughter Umi. There are many more expenses, sir. Many expenses. Look. Don't try to be greedy. I won't give you a dime more. It's strange. He gave us 700 rupees. And he'll give more. Just wait. Gentleman, please wait. Wait. Look. You seem like a good man. And this child will be happy with you. But if her mother comes and asks for her... what will I say? First go and bring a letter from her. And then you can take the girl with my blessing. Here's your letter. Gentleman, please wait. No problem. Don't cry. He's a good man. You can see that Sukhiya is crying. She's crying. The thing is, she loves Umi very much. If Umi leaves then she might die crying. If she dies then what will I do? Please tell me. So please take back your money. And give us Umi. You fool. Why are you standing here staring at me? - Run after him and ask for more. - Woman, this is all we get. We gave him false expenses and collected this money. Do you want me to even take his skin? What are you saying? And just think, he's a big man. If I'd asked for more money, he'd have slapped me. For 100-200 rupees he'd have broken my 1000 rupee teeth. Look Sukhiya. With this money I'll get you... a beautiful nose ring. You wear that and sit in front of me. Then I'll sing this song. Hey you. Come here. Police. - You go. - You go. - I say you go. - You go. Have you seen a ruffian who looks like a gentleman? No sir. Why are you saying no? What about that man who took our girl from our house... and didn't pay us our expenses? - Who was he? - He was tall... fat and influential, like you. Yes, that's the criminal Kundan. The police are looking for him. Anyone who helps us arrest him receives a 2000 rupee reward. 2,000? Sukhiya, if we get this 2,000 rupees, then it'll cover the rest. With that money I'll get a beautiful nose ring for you. You wear that and sit in front of me. Then I'll sing that Punjabi song. - Balle Balle... - Yes, I already know. Let's go. Who are you? I need shelter for one night. Can you give me? You? Mr. Mayor, you? I'm pleased to see you. How did you come here? First tell me, who are you? And how do you know me? You don't know me. But how could I forget you? I'm Garibdas. Garibdas? Who? Do you remember one day a man got trapped under a lorry? You saved his life and got him a job at a girl's school. I'm that Garibdas, and this is the same girl's school. Garibdas, today I need your help. - Can you help me? - Why even ask? I can never repay my debt, even by sacrificing my life. Tell me what I can do for you? Take me to the principal of this school. - Tell her... - This is my older brother who's come here looking for work. What's your name? Dharma, madam. - And your age? - 45 years. Is she your girl? Madam, she is my granddaughter. I want to educate her. You want to educate her. But who'll pay her fees? I'm a poor man, madam. - Can you work as a gardener? - Yes, madam, a little. - What salary will you take? - If you won't charge the school fees... then I won't take a salary from you. Alright. From today you're the school gardener. Go and do your work. Father, where are you? Come child. I'm here. Do you know what I have? What? These are my new books, father. I've passed the junior grade... and now I'm in the senior grade. Thank you, God. Today my child is in senior grade. Today I'm very happy. - How happy are you? - This much. - Only this much? - This much? - Only this much? - This much? Yes, father. I want you to always be happy. Father, why are you crying? These are tears of happiness. Tears of happiness? But when a person is happy, he laughs. How can he cry in happiness? I don't understand this. After you grow up then you'll understand these things. Father, where are you father? Come child. I'm here. - Father. - What is it, my child? These are the test results. - Did you pass? - No father, I didn't pass. - So you didn't pass? - No, but I got first rank. First rank! First in your class. No. First in the whole district. In the whole district. Thank you God. Today my child stood first in the whole district. Today I'm very happy. - How happy you are? - This much? - Only this much. - This much? - Only this much. - This much. I want my father to always be happy. You're crazy. You're still that little Uma for me. Come. Father. Father, you're crying again. Today I'm very happy, child. At this time of happiness, I remember your mother. She was your mirror image. And you are her mirror image. If she were still alive... then she'd be happy in the same way you are now. But father, you didn't tell me, why you started crying. Child. These are tears of happiness. But father, when a person is happy, he laughs. Why would he cry in happiness? I don't understand that yet. After you grow up then you'll understand it all. Look father, I've grown so much. You're still not big enough. First I'll take you from here and put you in a college. And after you pass your B.A., I'll send you abroad. And after you return from abroad, then you'll be big. Oh Father! Dear Sevakram. You'll be very happy to know that... daughter Uma has passed her last school exam. Now I want her to go to college in the city. For this you must arrange a house on the outskirts of the city... from where I can peacefully look after Uma's studies. From your Din Dayal. Hey, you're pouring tea, so watch the tea. Why stare at me? Look, why do you always call me 'Hey'? Don't you like the name Ratna? The name is very beautiful. So it means I'm not attractive? Oh dear! You're beautiful... your mother is beautiful, and your father is beautiful. If you have any more relatives, tell me their names... so I can pronounce them beautiful, too. I do all your work but still you're always angry with me. You don't even look at me. - Just look at me. - Ratna... there is happiness, fun and laughter in your life. So you make merry. I have many other things to do. Really! I know your other things. It's friends, associates and 'Vande Mataram'. Youths, youths Youths, change the destiny of India Remove the thorn from this garden of flowers Youths, youths, youths Break all the foreigner's webs and free our country No beautiful dream should be left incomplete If a lamp burns down our house, then extinguish it Remove the thorn from this garden of flowers Youths, youths, youths We, the citizens of India shouldn't be ashamed before the world If we die for the country then also we will live Shake the world with the slogan of Jai Jai Hind Remove the thorn from this garden of flowers Youths, youths, youths We have with us the strength of brave people The strength of Mr. Jawaharlal The strength of Mr. Jawaharlal and the devotion of Bapu Make our flag fly high in the world Remove the thorn from this garden of flowers Youths, youths, youths Youths, change the destiny of India Remove the thorn from this garden of flowers Youths, youths, youths Police! Put that in your pocket. But if you call the police then I'll... Remember young man, life is for giving and not taking. Who are you? I'm a student. - What's your name? - Amrit. - Why are you here at this hour? - The police are chasing me. And I'm injured. Uma! Uma. This young man is wounded. Take him upstairs and bandage his wound. Yes sir. Come. I'll go and check if the police are still chasing you. Come. Make yourself comfortable. - Is the wound deep? - No, it's just a scratch. You're bleeding profusely and yet you say it's not serious? Just wait. I'll put a bandage on it. I'm telling you one more time that no one came here. But sir, we saw him enter your house. We saw him. You must be mistaken. If at this time a stranger had entered my house... I'd have surely shot him. We're sorry to bother you. - Did it lessen the pain - Not less, it's completely disappeared. I think you didn't put a bandage on it... but performed magic. Don't try to flatter me Mr... Amrit. Amrit. I'm flattering, Miss Uma. Really you and your father... He's not my father. He's my grandfather. Oh! Really, you and your grandfather... are really so kind and polite, I feel I should get injured every day. So I can come here every day to hide. And you should apply the bandage every day. I don't think you're from around here. You're wrong. We've lived here for the last ten years. - Do you study? - Yes. At which school? Your eyes aren't so good. Do you think I'm of school-going age? Oh! I'm sorry. - You attend which college? - Wilson. I wish I'd been a student at Wilson College. Then we'd have met frequently. We can still meet. I was thinking the same thing. We can still meet and we will surely meet. These days of spring and this pleasant atmosphere At least now listen to my love-story These days of spring Keep on singing and laughing Keep on spreading joy everywhere Now there is no sorrow. We've reached our destination We have the partner for the journey of life At least now listen to my love-story These days of spring You are mine and I am yours Two love-birds have finally met Because of you my heart beats And there is this paradise of love Life is beautiful and our desires are young At least now listen to my love-story These days of spring These days of spring and this pleasant atmosphere At least now listen to my love-story These days of spring What is the gentleman thinking? I was thinking the B.A. exams are approaching. And everyone is preparing for this exam. Until we pass our B.A. exams we won't be able to meet daily. There won't be any romance. And the light from this life will disappear. And the Spring will leave this garden of love. Yes. We should then try honestly to fail the exam. So that we can get one more year for our romance. And the year of separation will be pushed a year ahead. Wonderful. Great idea. But I'm sorry this great idea didn't... enter my head instead of yours. So give me your hands and promise me you'll... try to fail the exam. - I promise. And you? - I promise, too. Amrit. Everyone will be surprised. And we'll go crazy with happiness. Have you gone mad, child? Why are you crying? You failed this year... so you'll pass next year. But father, I didn't fail. You didn't fail? No. I passed. You passed and still you're crying? How can I explain it to you, father? People not only cry in sorrow, but in happiness too. These are tears of happiness. Alright. So you're crying out of happiness? I'm really a fool that I didn't understand that. I'll give you more good news. We're going to London. London! My God! London. Yes Amrit, London. And he won't listen to me. He says I should become a lawyer. He says all young boys and girls... should know and understand the law properly. And he says sometimes the law becomes deaf and blind That's all right, but how will I live without you? And how will I live without you? For me, there won't be any joy either day or night. I think your grandfather is being unfair to us. Then why don't you face this injustice with courage? I'm thinking the same. What's there to think over? You should meet grandfather... right now and explain everything clearly. If you waste time in thinking, then everything will be ruined. But, but what will I say? Oh Amrit. Tell him you want to marry Uma. No, I'll say Mr. Din Dayal. I am Amrit Lal. I've come to ask your permission to marry your granddaughter Uma. So you want permission to marry Uma? But young man, you're forgetting something. Marriage proposals should be brought by your elders and not by you. I know that. But my father banished me from the house. It's because of your revolutionary thoughts... that you've become a freedom fighter like other college students. Yes sir. He doesn't want me to participate in the freedom movement. I'm sorry that you won't like my decision either. Why? Because the path you've chosen will make your life very difficult. The law will be after you. The police will be looking for you. And the CID spies will be following you like your own shadow. You're afraid of the law and the police. Young man, I'm not afraid of anyone but God. But I try to keep away from things might cause... harm to the innocent as well as the guilty. I understood. You think my patriotism is a crime. That's why you refuse. I don't think patriotism is a crime. I bow before patriots. Then, may I ask you the reason for your merciless decision? It's so merciless it doesn't care that two loving hearts will be destroyed? And may I ask why your love is so blind? So blind that it doesn't care about the welfare and safety of Uma? You know the path you're on. And you also know all the hardship and destruction that lies on this path. And when these destructions move ahead... then they'll consume not only you but poor Uma too. Her life will be full of sorrow. But I haven't hidden anything from Uma. She knows everything. She's willing to... She's willing to sacrifice her happy life and live with you. Now you decide. On one hand Uma's love... is so great and high and on other hand your love... is so low and selfish. Please forgive me. I didn't know my love was so selfish. I think there's no place for love in my life. Amrit wait. Amit. How can I complain as there's sorrow on both sides There is love before me and society before you Your destination is calling you but where should I go? There's no place for me away from you How can I complain as there's sorrow on both sides You be happy with all your helplessness, dear But I have to fulfill the promise of love my whole life How can I complain as there is sorrow on both the sides There is love before me and society before you How can I complain as there's sorrow on both sides Don't cry child. Don't cry. I've seen tears my whole life... and I don't have the courage to see more tears. If you can't live without Amrit... - then go. I won't stop you. - Father. Does Mr. Amrit live here? He lives here but he's not here right now. Can you tell me where and with whom he has gone? Madam, this is my hotel not a police station... that I require people to write... where they're going and when they'll return. May I wait here for awhile? Gladly. You can wait here for as long as... Madam you can sit for as long as you like. Go. Why are you staring? I think I've seen you somewhere. But I can't remember where. My memory has become little weak. But I've surely seen you somewhere. But where? Bingo! - Is your name Uma? - Yes. And the second question, is your grandfather's name Din Dayal? - And he lives at... - Number 12, Gokhale Road. Yes exactly. Number 12, Gokhale Road. Great. I have recognized you. Child, I'm your uncle, say hello to me. Uncle! My... You have an aunty too. She'll be happier than I to see you. I'll call her now. Oh beautiful one! Oh my wife! - Look, who's come? - Who? Our niece Uma. You used to cry when thinking of her. Look. She's returned after so many years. Yes, my daughter Uma. We've found you after so many years. Praise your destiny. You came here to meet Mr. Amrit... She's grown so much. Yes, God bless her. Why are you talking here? Take her inside. And don't let her leave until I return from the market with gifts. - Think of her as your prisoner. - Alright. Don't worry child. Come inside. Go child. Go. Look, Mr. Din Dayal... I recognize you and you have recognized me. We both understand our past. Now we'll learn if we can see into the future as well. I think you understand me? Whatever you have to say, say it fast and clearly. I don't want to waste my time, either. Look. I'I show you all my cards. The first card says that your name is Kundan. The police are after you. And you're running for your life. - Is that right? - What's next card? The next card says your darling daughter... or granddaughter, whom you took away from me forcibly... is again back in her place. Meaning? I mean she's a prisoner in my house. And her life is in my hands. My daughter is imprisoned in your house? Let me go. Please let me go. My grandfather will give you whatever you want. What's the hurry, madam? First let's find out how many rupees your grandfather... is willing to give for you. After that you may go. Mother. Mr. Amrit is coming. Amrit... Mr. Amrit is coming? Now I dare you to stop me. Come on. Don't think Mr. Amrit can do anything. Maybe you don't know that Mr. Amrit can be killed... if we make even one gesture. Mother, why are you becoming so angry over small things? Please leave. I'll handle her. - But if she escapes... - Don't worry about her. I won't let her escape. But don't be late. I have to bring tea to Mr. Amrit. You're very beautiful, Madam. Have mercy on me sister. Let me leave here. Tell me how much money you want. Sir, for your daughter, if I ask for all your wealth... it will be much less. But I'm not that ruthless. Look, if you can give me 5,000 rupees right now... then your Uma will return happily in your house. And one more thing sir. After this... if my poverty strangles me again... then I'll have to appear before you once every month. And you'll have to help me with 2000-4000 rupees. With this, the doors of the prison will be closed for you... and the doors of poverty will be closed for me. Why not just say I should fear you... and should give you 2000-4000 rupees every month to keep your mouth shut. But listen to me. I'm not ready to give you even a dime. Don't be angry Sir. Don't be angry. With anger you'll only harm yourself. Please leave from here. Get out! Who are you to meet Mr. Amrit? Who are you to ruin the happiness of a poor girl? Who are you to loot someone's house? I won't even allow your corpse to escape. But I'm thinking of Mr. Amrit. He may get into trouble. So get out. Run away. If you return, I'll break your legs. If you stare I'll gouge out your eyes. Go away! Leave it open. He'll surely come. He told me to get lost. But I'm not an amateur. I've attacked his weak point. He'll scream and shout and suffer pain. But he can't resolve it without coming to Jokhoram. He hasn't come yet. Why won't he come? He'll surely come. He has to come. Father! Uma. But you were imprisoned by Jokho. - Yes father. But I escaped. - How? I'll tell you later. First we have to get out of here. Where's that luggage going Garibdas? I don't know child. - Where is grandfather? - On the phone. Hello. Please call Sevakram. This is Din Dayal. Child, pack all your important belongings. We're leaving today. But the ship doesn't leave today. Whether the ship leaves or not, we're going. What's wrong, father? I'll tell you later. Hello, Sevakram. I want to evacuate the house today. Yes. Right now. There's a riot in the city. The police are headed there. Hail Mahatma Gandhi! Hail revolution! Hail the Motherland! Release Mahatma Gandhi! Friends, the police have banned demonstrations... and want us to return home. But we've made up our minds that we'll... continue our protests... and our national flag will fly high. Even the hands of death cannot stop that. Hail revolution! Hail Motherland! Release Mahatma Gandhi! Uma, there's a commotion in the city. There will be conflict between the police and the college students. Mr. Amrit is in danger. I tried to explain to him but he wouldn't listen. He'll listen to you. I know he can't refuse you. You can save him from danger. Why are you staring at me? If you don't believe me then read this newspaper. It's written that Mr. Amrit will lead a march... and the police will stop it. If the procession doesn't stop, the police will open fire. What happens then? What will happen? Ratna, where is he? Take me to him. Uma! Daughter, where are you going? Father, he's in danger. I want to go there. Give me permission. I won't give you permission to go there. Then father, I'll go without your permission. Daughter, what are you saying? Don't you respect me? Aren't I your grandfather? Grandfather, how can I explain it to you? Trust me. I can confront the whole world for you. But when Mr. Amrit's life is in danger, then... I won't hesitate to confront you. He's in danger right now. I should be with him. Why don't you understand, grandfather? I understand everything, daughter. In this whole world only you are mine. But for you, in this world, your grandfather isn't the only one... but someone else is there too. Grandfather, time is passing by. His life may be in danger and my live will become dark. Daughter, I've raised you with lots of love and care... so that your life won't be in darkness. You life won't be in sorrow. - May I go grandfather? - No, daughter... your grandfather isn't so weak... as to allow his granddaughter to go to a place of danger... and sit here quietly. These arms still have so much strength... that I can fight the world for you. I can go into the firing and beatings of the police... to bring Amrit here. I can break the hands that come forward... to ruin my child's life. Halt! Friends, the police have surrounded this place... but we're not mice to die in our holes. We'll face them before dying. Before dying, we'll kill at least two enemies. - So, are you ready friends. - Yes! - Are you ready? - Yes! - Let them come now. They won't find a place to escape. And those who come here won't return alive. 'Vande Mataram.' Hail revolution! Hail India! Fire! Mr. Amrit. You! Why did you come here? It's dangerous for you. If it's dangerous for me, then it's dangerous for you, too. I've come here to take you away. Thank you very much. But I'll say again... that I can't forsake my duty to my motherland. Your method of serving the motherland is wrong. I can see that instead of sacrificing life... you're more intent on taking life. You've forgotten the message of nonviolence given by our leaders. Our leaders are great but we aren't great. And the British government has even arrested... our leaders who teach us nonviolence. Now what else can we do besides killing and getting killed? Leader, congratulate us. We've captured our enemy during our first assault. Very good. Revolutionaries! You can arrest me... but you cannot arrest the law. The law will arrest each of you and punish you. Leader, give us permission to kill him. So it'll be a lesson to his friends and associates. - Take him away. - My young friends... just wait a minute. He's my criminal. I have old scores with him. I want to settle them. Hand him over to me. Hail revolution! Now Amrit will advance. No, Amrit, I won't let you go. - Leave me, Ratna. Leave me. - I beg you! - Fire! - Ah! Hail revolution! Today destiny has delivered the law into the hands of a criminal. What are you waiting for? Take your revenge, criminal. And end this story quickly. I'll do that. I agree. You're a true gangster. Instead of using a gun you want to kill me with a knife. Turn around. Attack me to my face. I've courage enough... to see you stab me in the heart. - I'm telling you, turn your back. - Coward, weak-hearted! You wanted to kill me. You wanted to take your revenge. You didn't understood me before. You still don't understand me. I don't want revenge. I want to save you. But why? I never showed you any pity. Why did you give me life? Because life is to give, not to take. I don't want your gift. Kill me, and if you think by saving me... you'll be saved, then that's your mistake You're trying to buy me... but your bribe won't buy you any mercy at all. Why do you think it's a bribe? I gave you no bribe at all. I didn't do you any favors. And I don't ask for mercy. I just listen to my heart. I released you with just a single hope. That you'll also listen to your heart some day. That's if you even have a heart. Kundan, to get away from me, you even jumped into the sewer. But in the end I still caught you. I agree the arm of the law is long. But before you handcuff me, let me take him home. And if I can save his life, let me do so. What will you accomplish by saving his life? He's a rebel. If he survive today, then tomorrow he'll be sentenced to hang. Inspector Sher Singh, will you be a machine your entire life? Or you will become human some day? Before you is a brilliant unconscious youth. His life is in danger. And you're sentencing him to death so easily. Like someone talking about an animal's death. From this I think God gave you a human's body without a human's heart. Your heart may melt some day. And your humanity will be restored. The question isn't about what my heart says, but what the law says. What does the law demand? I bow before that. Before the law, man is worthless. Don't say that, lnspector. You think of the past to convince yourself... humans don't deserve the law. The law is meant for humans. The law isn't meant for killing your quarry. The law was created to assist and serve. In my opinion, there is no law without assistance and service. But this youngster insulted the law. How can the law serve him? What can the law do to assist him? He will receive serious punishment. Very serious. But the question of punishment is determined after he's safe... and standing in a court of law where he can defend himself. Until he is convicted as a criminal, he's an innocent man. Until then, helping the youngster is your duty. Sher Singh, instead of asking that stone inside you, ask your heart. It will tell you the same. The law's first duty is to save lives. Taking the life might come later, or not at all. Grandpa, what happened to him? Dont get upset, dear. Nothing happened to him. A bullet just grazed his leg. He must be saved. Why not? Of course he'll be saved. Go. Go upstairs and look after him. Sevakram, call the doctor right away. Inspector Sher Singh, did you notice that innocent girl? Look closely. It's the same girl I requested you give me two days off... to see her dying mother. But you didn't give me that time off. And her mother died before getting another chance to see her daughter. Today the same story is repeating. But I'm not asking you for two days. Today I'm only requesting for two hours. And then I'll surrender to you. Come in, doctor. Grandpa, he's conscious. He's conscious. Thank you, doctor, Thank you very much, Look after them both. If they ask about me during my absence... then ask them to be patient. See that they're never in pain. Okay, I did what I had to. Now I'm ready to do what the law requires. Sher Singh, I came back. Now I'm ready to go with you. Din Dayal, you might remember I said one day... that the day my legs shook while following the law... that day would be my last day on Earth. Today is that day. Today I dispensed justice to two prisoners. But I committed an injustice to the law. And now I'm going to pay. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Please forgive me. I beg you. What's there to forgive? Please forgive me first. I'm asking you. I'm begging you. Okay I forgive you. You heard. sir. Now drop your stick. I've also wronged you. Take this stick and hit me on my head. Go Jokho. I forgive you, too. You forgive me later. I struck him for the same reason. Because he deceived you. Don't show me any mercy. We're both smooth talkers. - Take this and strike me. - If a misguided person realizes his mistake... and returns to the right path, then he's forgiven and not considered misguided. Okay, then. Sir, may I say something? - Of course. - I'm in great difficulty. - If you can give me 200 rupees... - Here's a tip for you. You'll get it. These days of spring and this pleasant atmosphere At least now listen to my love-story
