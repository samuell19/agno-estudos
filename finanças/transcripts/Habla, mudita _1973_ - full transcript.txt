It's me. How nice you smell, Rosita. Rosita! Coming! I'm leaving, Don Ramiro, to see if there's any damage. They're calling you, chickenshit! Put on your shoes. What a child. Good Morning. What is wrong with you, my sun? Oh, my child! And Rosita? - She's getting dressed. Come here, my queen. I'll prepare breakfast for you right now. Good morning, Rosita. - Good morning, Eleuterio. The rat's going to eat you! - Eleuterio! I told you to put on your shoes! Father, they're calling you from the switchboard. Is the bottle ready, Rosita? Let's give it to her. Oh, look at the bottle! Stop it, Ramirin! Stop it, I say! Oh boy, what a child! Ramirin! Ramir?n! - Come on! Jesus... Oh, my child! If I get hold of you? Good Morning. - Good Morning. Grandfather! Grandfather! Hello grandfather. Why are you bald? Because I am old. And if you're old, why don't you die? Breakfast! Come on. Yes! Yes! Well, it's not. Madrid! My girl, my girl... Animal! If I catch you, you'll see. Fatty! - I'll tell your mother. What's with the child, how funny you are. If the baby falls, you'll be sorry. Ramirin, you're hurting me! Watch out for the baby! Editorial Felix? It's Ramiro. Keep still! Put down that stick, Ramirin! - Listen! Good morning family. How are you? I told you to wear the other sweater. It's not cold here. Well, Dad, I think it's time to go. - I don't want to go! Boy! - You be quiet! You'll have to go up to the shelter to pick up your things. From today it the mating season of the owl. Eat slowly. Chew. Don't be so silly! Ramiro, why are you making that noise with the spoon? If I don't stir the sugar it won't dissolve. And if it doesn't dissolve, it's bitter. Do you want me to give you a lift? - It's not worth it, it's not definite. Is there much to finish? Finish what? - It's the 12th. It's outrageous. No, if I say it for those from the Parador, it's two weeks since they had to close. Well, the owl is unique... - Could you pass the coffee? Leaving Canada only to come here. Son, eat more slowly. - Mom! Set an example. - Chew, chew! Now that kind of thing fits. - An example... What example? A male. Alone. Without a female for hundreds of miles. But he continues to emit his mating cry. It's a language without communication. Or communication without language. Don't talk with your mouth full. And now the hoes. Words, friend Castelar, are only instruments like hoes or sickles. And what about a hoe that will not dig? That was broken. There used to be a huge forest with trees that couldn't be encompassed by 15 men. But with that invincible armada they've left us like this. What a bunch of scoundrels. - Who? Who else would they be? The hikers. Come on, the ones that survive. We'll tackle more here. I'm not in a hurry, I prefer this way. Or Road... Route. Track... Path. Cattle track. Pathway, that I also read in the dictionary. And pavement and cutthrough. And since I have a pastor or shepherd who is salaried and somewhat mongoloid, you must be more vigilant than Luis Miguel Domingu?n before they shot him. Hello, good day. Goodbye and good trip. - Hello! Send my greeting to your wife and her daughter-in-law and a cordial greeting for your son. - Thank you, Castelar. Farewell, Don Ramiro. Don Ramiro, what? We're packing up? Later, Sursuncorda. Later than when? Well, I'll go and tell. Well, aren't we going to pack up? I'm going to work. - Well, I'll stay here. Sursuncorda! Sursuncorda!! Hello! Hello! Hello! Anyone there? Is there anyone there? Hey! Girl! Are you alone? What's that? It's just... I've gotten lost. Ah good. You're German? No, from the Parador. Jesus, from the Parador... Well, then they never close. Sit down. Where have you been? Take them off. It's just... I got lost. Then you're one of those from Madrid. It seemed so to me. Madrile?o you had to be. A lot of money, now what good people. Oh, you're getting it everywhere, you great idiot. .... I'll make you some soup. No, no, for heaven's sake. You don't know what kind of soup I'm going to make. I don't want to bother you. What kind, huh? Garlic. - He's smart, the wretch. Yes, sir. Garlic and very spicy. I can't eat spicy, it gives me dermatosis. I get itching. - Everything here is natural. No, no, really. You'll be licking your fingers. Good, but not spicy. If you don't want it spicy, I'll have it chewed for you. Chewed? Very good. Very good, grandmother, really. But with a spicy... - It wasn't. As if I hadn't noticed. It's the garlic, birdbrain. I like it, but it hurts me. Let me die right here. A glass? No, not that. For me it's deadly. - Well, a glass. It seems that you like it. I don't smoke either. - Poor man. Wait. No whistle. Goodbye, and thank you very much. - You're welcome, sir. There was paprika. And some chilli. What a toff. An owl. The only owls left are in Canada. Take it. Me? But you can't hear. Besides, it doesn't play. And I don't know how to play either. Open your mouth. Say "Aah". You see? You can talk. Here comes the champion. Come here. I'll make you a father. Come here, asshole! - Lardass! You should have been up there an hour ago! You're always with them all and with the tripe! Hello, Don Ramiro. Have you seen the cows up there? What cows, God. What udders, good heavens. As big as elephants. And the merit isn't mine. It's the ferruginous water born in these pristine mountains. Water with silicate. Is he her boyfriend? - That one? Every day I thank God I didn't have children. That one when UNESCO came with the tests. They said he was the dumbest they found in all Spain. That's him. And they said he belonged to the last category. To that of prehistoric hunters. Do you know what a test is? Hello Carlota! But, Ramiro. I only got lost. Sure, as always. And I still haven't brought the things down. You'll be tired, huh? Weren?t you cold? No. - And what else? Nothing. Lies that I tell you. Is it a nightingale or a lark? A lark. Did you work up there? You'll catch cold. - Good work? And what's it mean "good"? Good.. it's the cowboy for the saloon girl. And bad for the Indian. They called you three times. We come here and they spend the day calling you. We have to go. Is that mint? I'll have a cup. And that? How long? - Who knows. This... I was going to ask you? No, nothing. Hey, you know someone who's dumb? - Yes. And a girl who goes with him. Who doesn't talk either. - His sister. Oh! - Fatty! Come on! Ramir?n! To bed! The ointment. The ointment! He must have eaten something spicy. - Shut up, you idiot. - The ointment. Don't be rude, Ramiro, or I'll scratch you. That's without going to Madrid. I'm sure it'll get worse there. It'll get worse, Carlota. Have you moved your bowels? This morning, but very little. If you want I can stay with you here. I told Ramiro that I would stay until Saturday and not... - We can both stay. But at the Parador we can't continue. No, me alone, up, in the shelter. Let's see... - Saturday. Grandpa has a girlfriend! Take care. Bye. - Bye. Hello, mute one. You do it. You'll see how it vibrates. Touch it. You. Poor little mute girl. Very good, very good, very good. Well, almost good. Well, let's see... Fine let's try the "O", it looks like the "O". No, O. Let's see if with the lighter... No, pretty, no, when you say "O", you don't keep it. Oh, girl, you're insatiable. Well, keep it. No, it's for you. For you, keep it. Keep it, keep it. Really, keep it. Poor little mute girl. I'll give you such a slapping. Hi. Pretty. Very good. Perfect. "A". You see? Very good, very good. For you. Write. But a space... Ra...dio. Ramble. Rascal. Ra as in Ramiro. It doesn't work. And even if it worked. What? Packing up? No! Well, I'll let them know. Come on. So we're not packing up? - Leave me in peace Ro as in... Like... rhododendron. Robber. No. Like rock. Pay attention. And here you have to be cleaner, girl. You should see how you smell, you smell of cattle. You have to be a lady. Ru... Ru. Ru... Like your hair Ruffled. What is that for? Ah! It's for a shotgun. And what do you want a shotgun for? To...

Open up! Come! - The guy with the mustache with your sister up the mountain... That's why Margarita didn't want to open up! Come, don't run! Hello, father. To name something is to own it. But say field.... And it will be fenced. Say home... And they'll tell you to clean it. Say wonderful. And they will try to sell it to you. Say I love... And they will tell you no.
