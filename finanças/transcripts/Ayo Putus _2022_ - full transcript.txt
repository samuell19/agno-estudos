Extracurricular activities introduction Bina Cakrawala High School Go, go, go! We are... Bina Cakrawala! B-I-N-A! Cakrawala! We are number one. We are the best. Are you ready? Yes, we are! One moment. - Oh, my! - Honey! You were amazing! - Did you like it? - Of course, I did. I liked it so much that I brought you a gift. Oh, my God! Chocolate? I love this! Anya... Honey? The universe told me... ...that it's your favorite chocolate. And just like the universe in your eyes... ...you make me realize that you're... Let's break up - Let's break up. - Hold on. I can prove that I'm better than your exes. I... Hey, hey, hey. No extra time. Wow, wow, wow. You'd be a great goalkeeper. Do you want to replace Jono? He... New girl. Your future. I think she's going to be your new prey. I just broke up. I need time to... ...heal. New kid? Here, chapter one. Complete. You only need to copy it. Oh, my! Thanks a bunch! I got you, bro. You're welcome. Luna. Oh, right. We haven't introduced ourselves. - Alma. - Okay. - Thanks for this. - No problem. That was how the girls look at Selatan. Selatan (South)? The futsal team captain earlier. Do you think he's handsome? What is it about Selatan that makes people crazy about him? He has deadly sweet talks. They say that if you become his girlfriend for three days, you'd feel... ...like you're the queen of the world. Putri, our classmate. He gave her a BTS concert ticket that was taking place abroad. Abroad! Not in Indonesia! Nanda. If you see her come to school with a branded bag... ...that would be a gift from Selatan! - He's that extra? - He's that extra. - Bryan! Oh, my! - Alma. Let's go home together. Hey, don't pretend like you're chummy with her. I've known her since elementary school. - Elementary school friends? - That's right. Okay. - So? - Okay. Here, your book. Relax, you can return it tomorrow. You're still going to see this face. Okay? Okay, then. I'm borrowing this. Thank you! You're welcome! - What extracurricular activity club will you join? - I think basketball. Don't you want to try photography? I don't think I have any talent in art. You're just being humble. You won a painting competition. Bryan, that was elementary school. And that was a class competition. I don't have a camera anyway. Me, too. I borrow my uncle's. Whose camera will I borrow? Basketball is the right choice for me. You can use mine. Selatan. Blacky. You? Bryan. Hey, not you. Leon. Hey, not you. What's your name, pretty? I'm Alma. And... What's your name? - Bryan. - Your boyfriend? He's my friend. Alma. Do you believe in love at first sight? I don't. Me neither. But what if I make you my crush? What if I don't want to be your crush? What won't I do for my future new girlfriend? Revolting. You're cool. I know. Get it! Eat that! But I didn't expect that. You, rejected like that. - Rejected? - Yes, rejected. - Me, rejected? - Yes. You, rejected. How else would you describe what happened earlier? Hey, dude. He was doing an observation. Observing the target. Am I right? How could you say that? Are you sure you can get her? Leon... Do you forget who I am? A lot of alumni from this one work in state-owned enterprises. But the campus is far. This one, I'm not sure about this. I think this is the best. Good environment and the alumni are successful. Mom, I think it's too expensive. But we need to be prepared. We need to have options. But if I can't get a scholarship... ...I better work first. Relax, Alma. For your education, your dad and I will try our best. Still, it's a lot of money. You better use it here. My daughter is the nicest in the world. Don't worry about it, okay? You don't worry, mom. Okay. Hi, Dad! Hello, Al. Have you taken a shower after school? Have you eaten? I have. I'm studying. Why are you calling? Nothing. I just miss you. Dad! So cute. And you just called me earlier. Wait, are you still at work? I just got back from a meeting with my boss. Poor dad. And when will you get back to Jakarta? Maybe in a short time. Great! Dad, about university... Please talk to Mom. That if I'm not accepted at a state university... ...you don't need to get me into a private one. Honestly... ...I agree with your mom. About the money, we can manage it. You just need to study diligently... ...to attain your dreams. Dad, you both don't need to worry. Trust me. I'm an adult. Let me try to work on it. You're still a kid. Don't be cocky. Why are you responding like that? I'm going to end this call, then. I'm mad at you. Alma, you do know I love you, don't you? I'm going back to work, okay? Okay, Dad. - One, two... - One, two... Pasir Awi and Muara Ciater. What are you doing here? Helping you. You're welcome. I'm going to sit here, okay? Even if I say you can't, you're already sitting there. That's why I was telling you and not asking you. This chair is the school's anyway, not yours. Do you like me? You're not letting go of my arm. Why did you touch me anyway? I can report you for indecency and unpleasant act. So, don't mess with me. Alma... I'm sorry if you felt harassed. I forgive you, as long as you don't bother me anymore. - Tan! - Tan... What? Another tip? Hold on. Tip #35. Never call a girl first. Wait for them to call first. - That's it, okay? - Hey, Tan. - Accompany me to the market tomorrow, okay? - What are you going to do there? - Take photographs. - I'm going too. I also want to do an observation. Come on, dude. Hang on. First... ...why are you doing an observation at a market? Observing the elders? And you, taking photos is about you and the moment. Why are you asking me to join you? - Are you sure you don't want to come? - I'm sure. Bryan will be there. So? Bryan will be there... ...that means Alma will be there too. - So? - Okay. - That's it. - Tomorrow, okay? Okay! Take care! Fish heads! - Can I take a photo of this, Sir? - Please. Is he really taking photos of fish heads? - I'm going this way. - What? - Aren't we going together? - Where are you going? The jackfruit's good. Can it be used for cooking? Your mother will cook it. Oh, no! Watch your step. Don't be too excited. Clean it first in the washroom. But where is it? Where is it? - There it is. Come on. - That's right. Come on. Hold this for a while. Hey! Hang on. Title: "The Market Thief". Hey, catch him! Oh, my God! The lens! I feel bad for Bryan. He said it's his uncle's. I'm indebted to him now. I can't do this. I'm indebted and it will mess up my study... ...I won't be able to focus and my grades will go down and... Oh, no! What should I do? Let me see. It needs to be replaced. I know that! You don't need to say it. - I mean, replaced. - I know, Selatan! You are making me even dizzier. I can help you. Help me how? I have the exact same lens. And I can give it to you if you want. Are you serious? But not for free. I know it's not going to be for free. But I need to have it. I will pay you back, whatever it takes. I don't need money. So? Let's be a couple. What did you say? No way! Whatever. It's an antique lens. It'll be hard to find. Hey, hang on! Yes? So? - Hurry up. - Okay. Okay, I'll... ...be your girlfriend. People say you only date girls for three days, am I right? Three days, right? Hey, answer me! What are you doing? Taking a picture of my new girlfriend. Al? Are you okay? Why is the lens... My God! Oh, no! Day 1 For Alma Strawberry cheesecake. It'll be so nice to eat strawberry cheesecake early morning. Crazy! - Do you want it? - Want what? - This. - This what? This, Luna. Strawberry cheesecake. Do you want it? Of course! You should've told me earlier. Eat it. Finish it. Beautiful Alma... ...why did you give away the strawberry cheesecake I bought for you? I don't like strawberry cheesecake. You don't like strawberry cheesecake, but you love strawberry juice. Funny. Well... ...strawberry juice and strawberry cheesecake are two different things. One is food, the other is a drink. - Different, is it? - How can you not know that? Because we're dating, the lens I promised you... The lens... That's right. The lens... Let me check it. See? It's fine. Let's keep it safe. Let's put it here. - So... - Your hands are warm. I have a sudden urge to eat strawberry cheesecake. Let's buy it. You want it now? You didn't want it earlier? I didn't like it earlier, but I suddenly want it. What won't I do for my love? Yeah. Yes! Alma! Sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Alma! Are you okay? Be careful! You don't need to shout. She's fine. Calm down. Bryan, I'm fine. Honey, are you okay? Are you really okay? Are you hurt? You should be careful. He's right. Be careful. I didn't see the ball earlier, so... No, not that. Not that, Al. There's something different about this girl. Different? All are same. - You mean about Selatan? - Yeah. The damage Selatan makes is huge. But don't let that influence you... Enough. You don't need to worry. I'm not going to be influenced by him. Are you sure you'll be able to break up with her in three days? What's wrong with him? See? He's not answering. How about this? If you can't break up with her... ...then you must give us a treat? I agree! How about that? In three days... ...I'm going to break up with Selatan. Okay. I'm going to break up with Alma in three days. Happy? Trust me. Let's go into class. Come on. Write that, okay? That's great! Bryan. Alma. Here's your lens. Check it first if you want to. Sorry for troubling you. You don't need to do that. What are you sorry for? It's no trouble. The problem was caused by me. So, I have to take responsibility. Okay, I'll take this. At least this will calm my uncle down. When I can buy another one, I'll return this to you. Relax. Alma. Does this have anything to do with Selatan? My honey. Let's go home together. I prefer going home alone. Hey, Bryan. That is a nice lens. - Funny thing... - Come on! Let's go home. I want to go home in a hurry. Let's go home. - Can you do it? - I can. You're so rigid. Don't you want to hold on to me? No, thanks. I'll tell the story about the lens, then. Whatever. I don't care. I'm tired of this. Why are you so serious? I'm kidding, Almarhumah. What did you say? You can't call me Almarhumah (deceased)! You Setan (devil)! Why am I suddenly Setan? Your name is Selatan, abbreviated into Setan. It suits your personality anyway. Like the devil! Okay. Where are we going now? Home, of course. Where else? Go straight and then turn right. Are you sure you don't want to hold on? I'm sure. Why are you holding onto me all of a sudden? You devil! Good afternoon, Auntie. Thanks. See you tomorrow. - What are we doing tomorrow? - Stock supply. Go in. I'm going to turn around in the front. Bye. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, Al. Who was that? - Boyfriend. - Boyfriend? A friend. So, friend or boyfriend? I don't know. What? New boyfriend, for sure. Yo, Selatan, my man! When will you come to Bandung, bro? Why would I go there? You come to Jakarta. Come here. I miss you. You can introduce me to your new girlfriend. - I want to know the story. - What are you talking about? No way! You'll steal her from me. Al! Al, your three-day boyfriend is here! Mom? Look. From here, he looks quite handsome. What's his name? Ketan? What kind of name is Ketan? Not Ketan. Setan. No. It's Selatan. Oh, Selatan. Well, he's waiting. Day 2 Don't mind them. Okay? - Who are you? - Don't pretend you don't know me, asshole! - Calm down. - I'm Anya's big brother! - The girl you played with! - Hang on. Anya? Alma! Are you okay? You really okay? If you have a problem with me, then hit me! Come on, hit me! Hang on! Calm down, honey. What's wrong with you? Why didn't you fight back? He's Anya's big brother, my ex before you. I heard about that. I get why he was mad. So, I let him. That's why you shouldn't play with someone's heart. Now you must bear the consequences. Have mercy! Shut up! I'm putting a spell on you to make you heal faster. I'm healed. - Thanks, Alma. Enough. - So, feeling better? - Yes. - It worked then. Let's go out after this. - Where to? - What if we watch a movie? Okay, but I get to choose the movie. Okay. But not... I told you not to watch a horror movie. How can the devil fear the devil? Babe, there's a jump scare scene after this. One, two, three! And then? The girl will be dead, but then she'll live again in the end. So, who will kill the girl? The Umbrella Grandma. Miss, don't spoil the story. It's annoying! Why? It's my right. I have the right to say whatever I want. But this is the theater. Miss... How do you have the courage to say that name? - What name? - The devil's name. - The Umbrella Grandma? - That's it. She's going to follow you home if you mention her name. Thank you. You're welcome. Where do we go after this? We're going to eat. I've made a list of three places. Oyster. Cauliflower steak. And the last one, molecular gastronomy. Please choose, Miss. I have my own choice. Here, Alma's favorite meatball. Super spicy! But I'm baffled. If you're eating it, no matter how spicy it is, it'll taste sweet. Just like kolak. So sweet. Thanks. I should be the one thanking you. You brought a friend here. You are lucky for this place. And so good-looking, too. Eat it before it gets cold. Let's eat. What should I add? Vinegar? It tastes good. Right? What do you think? - Fun. - Fun, right? Super fun. I don't really want to know, but I'm a bit curious. What's up with this three days? If you don't really want to know, why should I tell you? Just try and tell me. Maybe it's fun and entertaining. The answer's not interesting. Just tell me. If you insist. There's something called The Hedgehog's Dilemma. Humans are like a group of hedgehogs in the winter. And because it's cold, they gather for warmth. But the closer they get... ...they get pricked by each other's quills. - Schopenhauer? - Who is that? The philosopher who conceived the concept. I found it on Google. Oh, dear! No wonder. It sounded cool and suitable. So, I took it. It's okay. You sounded convincing. Of course. But you still haven't answered my question. Why three days? It's like in the movies. So, you have the beginning, the middle, and the end. Three days. I think it's enough to understand someone. No way. Humans are not that simple. You can't interpret someone in only three days. It's enough. Okay. Then I want to know what your interpretation of me is after three days. Are you right or are you wrong? Okay. But right or wrong is relative. But the point is I've never been harmed. Of course. But someone else is harmed. But I think they were happy. You flatter yourself. Are you sure they were really happy? You don't even know what's in their hearts. I'm definitely sure. Silly you. Wait, aren't you going to come in? That's a prohibition. - Okay, then. - Go in. Bryan? Try this. Don't give me too much or else I'll addicted. He's funny. Selatan? Please, take a seat. Thanks, Auntie. You said you're going home. I changed my mind. You said it's a prohibition. I felt bad that I didn't say hi to Auntie. - Hello, Auntie. - Yeah, hello. - You were together during elementary school. - That's right. But you went to a different school during junior high, didn't you? Yes, I moved to Pejaten. Wasn't that when you were afraid of Alma because she was scary, so you moved? Am I right? Mom! Why was I scary? Scary like this. Here. Don't be shy at my house. And don't be embarrassing. So, Selatan... ...what major are you planning to choose in university? I still don't know, Auntie. We're approaching the final test, but you still haven't chosen a major? Auntie, it tastes great. And the color is cute. - Do you like it? - I love it. It tastes good. And the color is natural? It's natural. I don't use chemical coloring since it's not healthy. Using suji leaves? That's right, suji leaves. That's it, Bryan. Because of suji leaves, the color is cute. - You know a lot about food. - Just a little. Auntie, thanks for the snack. Great. It tasted amazing. Thank you. Bring some home, okay? For your parents. I live alone, Auntie. Is that so? Okay, hang on. Bring this home. For your snack. I'm troubling you. Not at all. Thanks. You don't need to be jealous. You get some, too. - Thank you, Auntie. - Be careful, it's still a bit hot. It's unlike you to call me. Are you missing me? Don't get me something expensive if you're going to give me a gift tomorrow. - It's burdening me. - What? I heard that on the third day of dating... ...you give something romantic to your girlfriend. Says who? A lot of people. What if I give you my heart? Oh, dear! I'm eating. You make me want to puke. I'm also eating, your mom's cooking. Wait, does it still taste good? Very much. - She is an amazing cook. - What about you? I can cook, a little. Then cook for me one day. But tomorrow's going to be our third day. Just remember what I told you, okay? Bye. Day 3 What's wrong with your face? What's wrong with it? That's the face girls get on the third day. What are you talking about? Alma. Instead of thinking about Selatan... ...don't you want to think about someone else? Maybe there's a guy who likes you, but you just don't realize it. - Is there? - For sure! Who? I think I'm going to go out. Now I know why you don't like eating at a fancy place. Why? Because yesterday's bakso (meatball), this noodle... ...and your mom's cooking tastes amazing. It's a nice guess, but... ...that's not the reason. I just like it simple. Yesterday you said you live alone? Where's the rest of your family? My dad's in Bandung. And are you the only child? I have a twin. Oh, wow. That's fun! Guess his name. Utara (North)? What? Really? Oh, dear! It was just a wild guess! What is this? Some kind of wind direction brotherhood? You can say that. Why don't you live in Bandung with them? Why do you live here alone instead? Alma... ...can we not talk about Bandung? Okay. Before we go home... ...let's make a stop at my apartment. What are you going to do? You're not going to do anything to me, are you? Of course not! I have something for you. Welcome. Oh, dear. Is this a residence... ...or a dump? Well, I live alone. Oh, my God! Oh, dear. Selatan! Can't you clean this up? Finally! It's tidy now. Of course! Here, read this. - What's this? - Just read it. Interpretation of Alma: A small hedgehog. Feisty, but not prickly. What? Selatan... I can't read your writing. Let me read it, then. Okay. "Interpretation of Alma. A small hedgehog. Feisty, but not prickly. You'll get a bit of a scratch if you touch her. Her favorite drink is strawberry juice. She likes it cold. She eats everything. Two portions, if she can. Great at basketball. Fairly smart." "Fairly"? "And she hates people who spoil a story, especially near her. Although she's feisty... ...she's actually nice. Although she looks cold... ...her heart is actually warm. People might be afraid of her at the beginning... ...because of her sharp quills. But underneath the quills... ...she's just a little kid. A cute one, too. And friendly." Am I right? Everything's wrong. What a great view! Living in an apartment seems quite nice. You have everything here... ...and you get this view. I don't really like it. I prefer a house like yours. Lots of people. I want a fussy mother to wake me up. To have breakfast ready for me. To have someone bring me a lunchbox. That's how my mother is. She's like that. Here, I only have... ...loneliness. But I don't really hate it. The quiet and being alone gives me time to think. Especially thinking about you. Let's break up Selatan. It's time. Let's break up. It's been three days since we have been dating. So, as per our agreement at the beginning. But we can still be friends. Because it turns out I don't really hate you. You're going to drop me home, aren't you? So, what time will you be home? Of course, we're going to wait for you. - Alma. - Hang on. Your daughter wants to ask you to buy a gift for her. Don't forget to buy bakpia. - Aren't you bored of it? - I'm not! Okay, then. Wait for me to come home, okay? Okay. Have a safe journey, okay? - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Bakpia again? You know what I like. I'm going to school, okay? - Take care, okay? - Okay. Hello. You didn't break up, did you? She broke up with me. She broke up with you? She broke up with you? So, you're not going to buy us food? Dude, I really wanted you to treat me to some expensive food. Here. It's for you. You said you wanted someone to bring you a lunchbox. You don't need to be confused. We're... ...friends. Thanks. Friends? Crazy! It's a new record! This is the first time a girl broke up with Selatan. Good for you to have broken up with him. Someone like him needs a lesson. Al... ...do you want to talk about it? I'm... I'm fine. Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan, and Makassar... ...are the metropolitan cities of Indonesia. Attention: we have received some sad news. The father of Alma Amelia has died. Please pray for the deceased and his family. Al... At your new school... ...a lot of boys will surely have a crush on you. I think so, Dad. Silly girl. Whomever you choose later... ...he must be able to replace my position. Why are you saying all this? As if I'm getting married soon. I don't even have a boyfriend. Why are you still close to me? I don't know. Some are from the seed, some were bigger. I bought it from a lot of places. Why? - They're holding hands. - I think they got back together. Oh, dear! I have a riddle. What food is surprising? - "Soup." - What do you mean? "Souprise!" - You should be surprised! - We're surprised. Day 49 Thank you. For what? For yesterday. For today. For tomorrow. Just thank you. I should be the one saying thank you. Thank you for... ...accompanying me all this time. Thank you, my honey. "My honey"? Hang on. So, we're... What I asked you the other day... Yes. I feel like I need more time to find out about my feelings for you. That's why I agree to give us an extension. Okay, my honey. - My honey? - Man, you said you broke up. Okay, okay. I admit I lost. Happy? Are you in love? Well, I wouldn't dare say this is love. But... I lose, yes. What do you want? - Hand me the cake. - Cake? Here. When will you stop this? When you break up with Alma. What do you mean? You made a bet? Is that it? Selatan, you made a bet with them that you'll buy them food until we break up? No, he's... ...weird. - You're crazy. - Seriously, I won't do that to you, honey. And you two... Why didn't you tell me earlier? We could have worked together. I would not break up with him, so we can eat great food all the time. Am I right? - I agree! - Let's order some more. Sir! I want to order... Are you ready for next week? We're going to play against Erlangga High School. Of course, we're ready. - Let's go. I'm exhausted. - So, what I think is... So cute! Ouch! One more. Be patient. Bear with it. Hang on, I'm putting a spell. Ouch! It hurts! Selatan, enough! Be patient, a little more. How did you fall anyway? You shouldn't change your shirt in public, especially in front of the girls. Can't you do it in the changing room? Jealous? - No! - Are you sulking? No! Ouch! - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Enough! Are you really in a bad mood? How about this? To get you out of this bad mood, what do you want to eat? - Whatever. - Satay? - Whatever. - Martabak? - Whatever! - Stop saying whatever. Whatever! Okay, how about this? Wherever you want to go, I'll follow. Whatever you want. The food is great, Uncle. That's why you should call him chef instead of uncle. Am I right, Dad? I wish I was a chef. But thank you for saying my cooking is good. - Yes, Uncle. - And you can call Utara "U". Why "U"? He has a lisp. What? By the way, have you asked for her parents' permission? Of course, I have. I'm not kidnapping her. Well, it's you we're talking about here. Wait, hasn't it been more than three days? You're amazing. He usually dates a girl for only three days. That's it. Sometimes only two days. Utara is different. When he has a girlfriend, she'll be the only one. Am I right? He's a slave for love. His girlfriend right now is his friend from elementary school. But if I may know... ...why doesn't Selatan go to a school in Bandung? Selatan? Go to a school here? He wouldn't like it. You'd go to Jakarta instead, wouldn't you? That's the intended position. - Sorry. - It's okay. No problem. You must be curious... ...about why Selatan only dates a girl for three days. He told me that he does it just because he wanted to. That's the way he is. He's... ...reserved. Selatan and I... ...don't have a lot of memories about our mother. We only remember that since we were kids... ...we've been raised only by Dad. But one day... ...Mom suddenly showed up. We were all happy. But the happiest one was... Selatan. He became the youngest kid. Spoiled. Loved. But on the fourth day... ...Mom left. That's why he hates this house. Take good care of him. He may look tough. Like a strong guy. A player. But in reality... ...he's sensitive. Back to Jakarta. You can feel the pollution. It's unbeatable. - After this, we're going to... - Let's go. - Where are we going? Why are you in a hurry? - Hurry up. You're so slow. Why do we have to hurry? Enjoy the ambiance. - We're working out. - Working out? Don't do that! - Watch out! - I almost fell. Stop! Or else you're really going to fall. Man, we're happy if you're with Alma. Seriously. Alma is a nice girl. We're happy... ...that someone is finally making Selatan fall in love. Right? Hey, Tan! - How are you? - What are you doing in Jakarta? What are you doing here? - I'm bored in Bandung. - What about school? As usual, we're skipping school. Oh, right. This is my girlfriend. - Tera. This is Aldo. - Hi. - Hi. Aldo. - Alma. We were close friends in junior high. Right, Tan? Yeah. Let's hang out. Viper Place. With Riko. Join us. - No, thanks. - Join us. - Really, no. - It's going to be fun. I feel bad to disturb you. I won't disrupt your reunion. Are you really okay with this? Sure? - Okay, we'll meet there. - Okay. - I'll be waiting. See you. - See you. Let's go. Are they really your friends? Them? Friends. I mean... Not Aldo, but Tera. Friend? - Is it obvious? - It is. You were awkward in front of her. Who is she? Your ex? She's not even an ex. They've been dating since junior high. I liked her, but I wouldn't steal my friend's girl. That's impossible. So, it's your first love, but obstructed by your own best friend? What are you talking about? It's unimportant. Who was your first love anyway? You. Honey, will we go to the lake later? The lake? Aren't you going to Viper Place with your friends? It's not going to be long. I'll probably only be there until 4. So, we can go to the lake at 5. What do you think? - Okay. - Okay? I'll meet you there. - Is it okay? - It's okay. Okay. - Okay, have fun. - I'll meet you there, okay? Bye. See you later. You look so dapper. - You still remember. - Of course. It's unusual for you to be here. I need to take care of my car. And my IOS stock in crypto is going up. How cocky! Boy! It's only a myth. Take the stem, tie it outside of your mouth, then put it in your mouth. - It's not right. - Man, shut your mouth. Don't you remember who I am? You're the man. And you're still the man! - Here I am. - Hail Selatan. - Cheers. - Cheers. Wait up. Where's Aldo? I think he's puking in the toilet. Let him be. He's weak. Okay? Set these aside. Truth or dare. Don't mess around. You. Dare. I like this. So? You... ...kiss Selatan. - Man, come on. Don't do this. - Will you do this? - What are you doing? Don't mess around. - Come on. This place is crowded... Alma? Alma! - Let's go. - No, I need to meet Alma. Man, you're drunk. You can't go home on your own. - Tan, come home with us. - Shut up! Shut up! Pick it up. Pick it up. Let's break up! Alma. Al... Yes! The final test is done. After that, we're graduating. After graduation, we're free! Great. Tan, let's play a game at your house. Alma. - I need to explain... - You don't need to explain anything. I don't trust you anymore. He's fine now. Selatan is better now, Al. He had minor injuries. Let's go to the canteen. Don't you want to meet Selatan? No. Tell him I said hi. Don't you want to tell him that you're going to Jogja tomorrow? I've told you. I'm leaving, okay? Al... I know this... This is not the right time. What? I like you, Al. You don't need to respond. I just wanted you to know that. I just wanted to tell you how I feel before you leave for Jogja. That's all. I know your response anyway. I'm sorry. Thanks for being honest. Al... Remember your goal there, okay? Don't be influenced by unimportant things. Okay? Okay, Mom. Thank you. Call me when you get there. Bye, Mom. New Student Enrollment Garuda Mandala Yogyakarta Hey. - Selatan. - Something fell. Selatan, did you run away from the hospital? I even bought a ticket to get in here. Forgive me. There's a reason behind the incident, but it's not important now. I was wrong and I know it. So, forgive me. But before you go, you need to know something. I like you. I've felt this for a long time. I was confused at first. I didn't believe it. I tried to fight this new feeling, but I finally realized... ...that I couldn't. Because you're different. Selatan... Do you remember... ...The Hedgehog's Dilemma you told me about? I realized... ...that we had become too close. And our quills were pricking each other. Maybe we need to find the perfect distance between us... ...to avoid hurting each other. That's why I... ...I want to stay away for a while. And what about us? For now... ...let's enjoy the distance between us. There are only two possibilities. Either the love will grow... ...or it'll fade. Take care, okay?
