I have few memories of my childhood, but I do remember one thing... I refused to eat breakfast. Since discovering the cinema when I was little... ...I collected copies of films. The journey of the little girl with her parents... ...is one of the first films that I had. I made this same journey. Thanks to the reel numbers, I reconstructed its itinerary. They left from Brittany... ...passed through Paris... ...then went down to the Riviera. I played the film over and over again, even though I knew the images by heart. I loved the excitement of loading a new spool... ...and the discovery of what I would find on it. Seeing the lives of others fascinated me. I tried to assess the character of these anonymous people, from their faces. I created a destiny for them... ...preferably tragic if I felt that they had stupid faces. Over more than 30 years, I've amassed hundreds and hundreds of reels. But I always remember this first film with the little girl. The parents we saw in the picture, seemed to be in love... ...and full of kindness for their child. Such family happiness was quite foreign to me... Incomprehensible. There are plenty of things from my childhood that I don't remember. No doubt there were times that are better forgotten. We often idealise our memories. If I could see reality again, revisit the past... ...would my memories look like these images? The best thing about memories... ...is to be able to invent them. But in this case, what can I know of my own life? I believe that my childhood was particularly one of suffering. Not just because my mother didn't buy me Pif comics... ...because they were communist. All my friends had Mexican jumping beans, except me, ...for fear of the big night. There is a place of which I have very fond memories. Ambleteuse, a village in northern France... ...where I spent all my summer holidays. My best friend's father showed films by Keaton and Chaplin... ...with a Super 8 projector, in the attic of his house. Here he is, my friend's father. His name was Philippe Lebrun. Dr Lebrun. He'd wanted to become a director, but his parents had opposed it. He became a doctor... ...and I'm convinced that all his life he's regretted it. I loved Dr Lebrun who showed us films... ...of authentic tradition. I remember his voice echoing in the dark. For the first time I realised that a father could be kindly... ...and spend time with his children. My father had never spent an hour, playing with me, or taking care of me. And here is Sabine... my first love-interest. Sabine was the sister of a boy from our band. She often came to watch movies with us... "The attic clan". Sitting next to her... ...I took advantage of the dark to snuggle up next to her. One day I took her hand... ...and she didn't pull it away. Later I kissed her on the mouth, but without using my tongue. Nobody had told me that could happen. This is how, as 11-year-old Fege... ...I discovered the beauty of cinema and feminine sensuality. Since then, for me, they've remained associated. A few years ago, I received a call from a solicitor. A distant member of the family had died. He asked me if I collected movies. There were old boxes of film that no one was interested in. I had 48 hours to pick them up before it all got dumped. I hurried up. The name "Expedit" was on many of the boxes. On the way back... ...I thought about the name, Expedit. It was not unknown to me. My grandfather's boat was called the Saint Expedit. It was, until the 1940s, our real family name. For obscure reasons, just after the war... ...the name of the other branch was adopted. Expedit is the patron saint of urgent causes. And that of schoolchildren, driving licence applicants... ...drug dealers and premature-ejaculators. At home, I took a spool randomly and loaded the projector. I remember being startled. I found images from the Opale coast... ...taken near Ambleteuse. I saw my father young, very thin, and me as a young child. I don't remember a gesture of my father's tenderness towards me... ...and I saw him, before my eyes, stroke my hair. Another thing bothered me. The physical similarity between my father as young and me at the same age. With me having the feeling of having nothing in common with him... ...I was faced with this evidence... I was his spitting image. Or the other way round. The image I have of my father, is this one... A fat man for whom I simply did not exist. He had more consideration for his dogs than for me. My father was a biologist. He did medical analyses... blood, urine, stool. In his laboratory there was a cabinet of shitty jars... ...that people brought to have analysed. It was disgusting. My father loved hunting, He liked to eat game that he was proud to have shot. He spoke with his mouth full. He didn't eat, he wolfed his food. He burped and farted at the table, and that amused him. It's because of him, since childhood... ...I felt a deep disgust for food. There are many things that I've never tasted... ...so the idea of swallowing them is unthinkable to me. As a child, they tried to force me to eat, without succeeding. I was scolded, I was forbidden to leave the table if I hadn't finished. I limited my diet to certain dishes... ...mostly french fries, occasionally steaks... ...that I took like a medicine without chewing them... after cutting them into pieces. I tried to remedy this dietary disorder... ...and tried several therapies at different stages of my life. One of them, extremely violent, called Primal Cry... ...consists of screaming, to release the pain... ...buried deep within oneself. I then had the most horrible nightmares... ...that an Italian-Spanish director of 'giallo' could imagine. During these sessions... ...whole swaths of memories of my childhood... ...came rushing back. Everything was there, fortunately inaccessible... "'deliberately forgotten memories to protect myself. It didn't take away my disgust for food... ...but it was a revelation. All of our past is within us. Even if we don't have access to it, it's all there, perfectly recorded. I forgot that I was able to live like that. However, in those boxes I found a film shot in Ambleteuse... ...where I wanted to look like Buster Keaton... in "College Sportsman for Love". There's the sailing-dinghy belonging to my grandfather. I didn't even remember that someone had filmed it. Strangely, there were among the inherited movies... ...another shot years ago which showed a similar situation. I found it amazing that another child, one of my ancestors... ...experienced before me the same need to reach the open sea... ...and find his freedom. This coincidence reminded me of an odd experience that happened to me... ...while I was smoking some excellent weed. I suddenly had a kind of mystical revelation... ...all the more clear and obvious, that it's hard to put into words. We are a repeating sequence. Each generation is the expression of a single identity... ...which reproduces and expresses itself many times over time. I'm just a link in a long invisible chain. I was going through a period of doubt, as I was reaching my forties. In this "midlife crisis" so beloved by women's magazines, ...the age where we're supposed to be a bit lost... ...which has been the case for all ages... ...that I've been through since I was born. I thought back to my mystical revelation, and the long invisible chain. My fear of becoming like my father, tormented me. Maybe after all... ...these reels could teach me things about my ancestors and myself. While taking inventory, I found 10 boxes labeled "Lucette". "Lucette cabaret", "Lucette can-can", "Lucette birthday". I was very fond of Aunt Lucette and I have fond memories of her. She had bad reputation in the family. I who only knew her late in her life... ...discovered amazing images of her in her youth. At her death, Lucette left me an exercise book. Inside, there was a badly-written note on a loose folded sheet. My little Andre I have a feeling that you won't have an easy life like other people You will find in this notebook notes that I made Make good use of it. Maybe it will help you. One day, no doubt, you will understand. The notebook contained notes on family members and strangers. Dates, names. That of "Maurice Expedit" appeared all the time. Rumors circulated about the number of mistresses that he had had... ...one of whom would've been Matisse's favourite model. A true myth, the family figure of total success... ...being sole creator of the fortune from which his descendants benefited. In fact, I didn't know anything of my family's history. Just a few contradictory stories. It was said that on the paternal side of the family... ...many were addicted to the bottle. Others said that on the maternal side, we drank nothing but vintage wine. Rumors, gossip, like in all family stories. Thanks to Lucette's notebook and recovered reels... ...I might be able to piece together the lives of my forebears. I could fill in the holes, from my collection... ...after all, family stories often look alike. Might as well start at the beginning, with him by whom everything happened... Maurice Expedit. My great-great-grandfather, Maurice Expedit... Wait, this isn't the right movie! My great-great-grandfather, Maurice Expedit, was an engineer. A patent holder, who had made his fortune in the creation of machine-tools for manufacturers. He was a friend of Louis and Auguste Lumiere of Lyon... ...who invited him to the presentation in Paris... ...of their new invention... ...in front of the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry. That's where it all started. Maurice immediately became a lover of cinema... ...the device for creating animated images of reality... ...and projecting them onto a screen for a crowd of spectators. During this screening, one of the first film critics... ...a journalist from the scientific journal "Nature", reported... It is real magic. Before your eyes, the leaves of the trees are moving. Maurice ask the Lumieres if he could obtain one of their devices. They refused. Their invention was not for sale. Maurice was not the sort to give up. Some months later, he bought a less sophisticated projector in London ...that he turned into a camera, and immediately began shooting. Of these trials, only a few metres survive... ...of the film that was shot as a snub to the Lumiere brothers. The sprinkling hoses... ...is a nod to their greatest success, the first comedy ever filmed. Maurice had perceived the unspoken obvious from this famous film... ...the implicit metaphor of ejaculation. It was the reason for its popularity, according to him. These are rare images of Maurice from the collection... ...because if he filmed a lot, he was not filming himself. He had many mistresses. It must be said... ...Maurice was insatiable about women. He also had many children. The exact number remains questionable today. But what is curious, is the number of children... ...to whom he passed on his love of cinema or pronounced taste for sex... ...and for the luckiest boys and girls, both at the same time. A number of his descendants started filming their lives... ...and then sometimes passed this gift on to their own children. Maurice Expedit had devoted his life to pleasure and the joy of living. He liked to travel and he traveled the world. He liked discovering cultures, and different ways of living. He appreciated the slow pace of ocean-liner trips... ...which allowed time to fall madly in love... ...during the time of a crossing. At 18 years old, driver's licence in hand... I'd undertaken a crossing of Ireland with my friend Philippe. Philippe, passionate about literature, was following in Joyce's footsteps. More modestly, I hoped to meet some freckled Irish girls... ...like those seen in tourist brochures. For many years I still drove my 2CV... and when she was too out of breath, I put her in a 2CV drag race, to finish her off with a dignified death. I never finished the race. I planted it in an embankment. The first "official" child of Maurice Expedit was called Henri. Read what Lucette writes... She doesn't seem too fond of him. Henri was the spitting image of his father... ...and had no trouble enjoying the life that the inherited fortune bought him. While he was at the head of a substantial industrial empire... ...Henri was also going to marry Ghislaine Duthiez... ...the daughter of the mining tycoon of the entire northern region. Among the people who attended the wedding... ...there were workers from one of the factories which Henri was to inherit. The onlookers watching the rich marrying off their children... ...had to be like Lumiere's spectators... ...who, seeing images of Papuans, or Chinese opium smokers... ...discovered an unsuspected world before their eyes. The wedding specialist was Uncle Jean-Paul. We modestly called him "Uncle Jean-Paul"... ...but he was actually one of Maurice's illegitimate children. Jean-Paul ran a very original Photo-Cine store... ...called "Studio Jean-Paul". Also being passionate about cinema... ...he offered filmed coverage in addition to traditional photos. He was supposed to be able to predict if a union would last... ...and tell an arranged marriage at first glance. I imagine that one of the most important choices of his life... ...was to decide between living to make money... ...or try to satisfy his passion with the risk of never winning any. Henri had made a good deal by marrying Ghislaine Duthiez... ...but Maurice Expedit did not approve of the proceedings. Eternal lover, ...he could not sustain a union motivated by sheer interest. I even think that he had a certain contempt for industry. He had respect for engineers... ...appreciated technological... ...but hated the presumptuous bosses and their little side-kicks When Stephane, one of his other sons... ...decided to give up a marked-out industrial career... ...he was the first not to blame him. After language studies in England... ...Stephane was sent to the United States... ...to defend certain Expedit patents, copied by dishonest companies. He arrived in New York... ...and was to take a trip to the west coast. It only took him three days to question everything. In the first weekend, in Atlantic City... ...at the bend of a street adjoining the boardwalk... ...Stephane was going to meet someone who'd change his life. Her name was Vicky... ...and as soon as he saw her, he felt he knew her already... ...opening in his mind a strange gap in space-time. Vicky was a contortionist, tightrope walker, acrobat. She worked in a prestigious circus... ...the Barnum and Ringling Brothers. To announce his decision to Expedit... ...Stephane sent him a telegram that Lucette copied in her notebook. My very dear father, I am writing to you from the East Coast because I didn't go west to recover the patents. From now on I'm employed in a circus. Understand that I have fallen madly in Love... something you will grasp easily, I'm sure. All the best, Stephane Expedit. Uncle Jean-Paul... ...tired of filming weddings and communions... ...had gone to Paris to try his luck as a film director. After one disappointment after another... ...he had found a job in a cabaret in Pigalle... ...for which he took the shots. I also wanted to become a director. At every Christmas, every birthday, I was asking for a Super 8 camera. And one day I got it. In Ambleteuse, I undertook a remake of "Lawrence of Arabia". I was playing Lawrence... ...and Sabine was to play a princess whom I'd rescue from kidnappers. Her brother Hubert, in charge of special effects, was the wind. In high school, I talked in my first feature-length film. It was the story of two guys who stole chocolate from bakeries. But very quickly, what I liked best of all, was filming my girlfriends. Without realising it... ...I was becoming part of a movement I was unaware of. That of filmmakers of the day, filming their loved ones... ...in a vain attempt stop time. These people were filming their lovers, their children, their loved ones. Affection for loved ones comes through in the pictures... ...since the camera records much more than simple reality. It records both feelings and desire, at the same time. Long after the disappearance of their creators... ...these images fade in turn, taking with them a bit of the world... ...the fleeting perceptions of the moment and memories of loved ones. In the 50s, ...my grandpa Raymond Expedit Bonzel... ...is mandated by the Ministry of Industry... ...for a study tour in the USA. An engineer specialized in steel... ...it was he who lent me his boat is Ambleteuse. Also touched by the cinema bug... ...Raymond shoots movies of the factories he visits... ...which remain the only film achievements... ...of Raymond Expedit Bonzel, my grandfather. The drawing of steel wire in the USA Only he could believe that a movie on the manufacture of steel cables... ...might interest anyone other than a builder of suspension bridges. END OF PART 1 PART 2 The film lasted three hours twenty minutes. The wire-drawing association is trying to have him reduce it to 90 minutes... ...but, arguing about his final-cut, he refuses to cut a single shot. At the end of his film, Raymond relates productivity of Americans to their high salaries. In order to compare purchasing power of American and European workers... ...he prices women's underwear on both sides of the Atlantic. Beneath his austere engineer looks, it was indeed an Expedit! During my first visit to lnsas, the Brussels film school... ...I was shooting a movie on the cinematographer Henri Alekan. He showed "The State of Things" from Wim Wenders, that he'd lit. "Pleasure" I believe that the word "pleasure" is not a fair thing. Because for me, it's... ...obviously, not a bore to shoot film. I find it so difficult... So many problems arise... ...suddenly appear... When we agreed to make a film... ...that I can't say that... ...that it needs use the word pleasure. Brussels... I met Remy there... ...and we quickly became friends. Shortly after, he introduced me to Benoit... ...his childhood friend. These student years, at least at first... ...were tinged with carelessness and youthful debauchery. We drank quite a lot, but above all, it must be said, we fucked a lot. As far as I was concerned, it was what I was trying... ...to spend most of my time doing. For 2 years, I lived with Remy in a studio... ...which had no divider other than a bookcase. We had a kind of contract. When one of us brought a girl in... ...he paid for a movie for the other, who had to get out. Together with Remy and Benoit, I quickly understood... ...that at school we wouldn't be doing the films that we wanted to make. In our spare time, using rented school material... ...we shot "Daniel-Daniel"... ...the fake trailer of a film that didn't exist. We shot it in real anamorphic cinemascope... ...by tinkering with lenses. To test perspective, or a day-for-night effect... ...I was filming the city to have a small horizon. Without knowing it, I was copying my great-great-uncle Octave... ...who filmed the landscape from his window, when testing. Camera assistant and excellent technician... ...he worked on many films of Marcel Pagnol. If there was one person in my family who I'd have liked to have met... We could've talked about cameras and lenses, film and image formats. Uncle Octave liked to film his daily life... ...but his obsession was to fix on film the famous green ray... ...which forms for a few seconds on the horizon at sunset. Before shooting "Man Bites Dog"... ...we were still carrying out tests... ...to see if we can inflate to 35mm, the format of cinemas... ...images shot with our limited means in 16 mm. Watching the landscape go by through the train windows... ...I remembered the first movie from my collection... ...that of the little girl coming down with her parents to the Riviera. Maybe for her too, it was the first time she saw Cannes. Being selected in Cannes with one's first film... ...even in an alternative section, is unexpected. We didn't know what to expect, and we were not disappointed. Although we didn't turn up to join the parties... ...we'd stick movie posters everywhere we could. We even didn't care about the palm trees. I was happy We'd finally managed to make our feature film and it was real. It was at Cannes that I received the only letter that my father ever wrote to me. A little note on a card, a few lines. My thoughts are with you and all my best wishes. Love, Jean. The letter had as the only address... Festival Palace, The title of the film, 06, Cannes. I read and re-read the words. I didn't know what to think. I had waited so long for a gesture on his part... and just because he'd seen his name in the newspapers, he wrote to me. I kept his postcard and I'm left with the surprise... ...like a good twist you might find in a not-well-written script. Quiet!... action! You know... I thought that... It did something to me to see those old movies again. You know, it's a bit... like a memory when I look at those images. A memory... a box in my head that I'd forgotten about. Basically, maybe that's what the cinema is for. I don't know. And I realize that... Cut, I was too long. Watch out... action! We can see... Imagine... in 10 years when we all see each other. You'll have put on weight, Remy. Maybe will have gone bald. Maybe we'll have become castards or mandais. I don't know. You are upsetting me with your nonsense. So! More than twenty years later, we are here where we are. Remy is dead. Making a film is indeed hard, as Alekan said. But if a film is difficult, then what can one say of a life? The street where Remy and I lived in Brussels was called "Long Life Street". I didn't think that his would be so short. Deaths... we see lots in the movies... ...especially ours, but in real life... real life has nothing to do with it. I've had dreams many times that Remy wasn't really dead. Once, I was walking into a cafe, he was there playing pinball. He explained to me that he staged his death to be peaceful... ...have an easy life, escape the world, We don't know where we will be in ten years, or the next day... ...or what life has in store for us. So might as well enjoy existence and the present moment. I remember the end-of-exam parties when I was a student... Nursing school evenings at the Red Disc, a Brussels club. The obsession with not going home alone, To bring back a girl, if only for part of the night. That constant need for sex. That was maybe my way of finding meaning in my life. A kind of "cogito ergo sum", to "I fuck therefore I am". A way of existing in the arms, in the tenderness of another. It was Ambleteuse, I must have been 12 or 13 years old. Sabine's parents had gone shopping in Boulogne-sur-Mer. To keep her brother Hubert away... ...I'd stolen a few francs from my mother... ...and I sent him to buy us cakes at the village bakery. Sabine and I were finally alone for half an hour. She took me upstairs to her room, which was strictly forbidden. She lay down on the bed... She was wearing her green 2-piece bathing costume. Then slowly Sabine slid her costume-pants along her legs... ...uncovering a tuft of hair that I contemplated from a distance... ...totally petrified. She stared at me for a moment without saying anything... ...proud of her newly emerged hair... ...and no doubt already aware of the power of her sex and femininity. After a while, Sabine put her swimsuit back on... ...and we went back downstairs without saying anything. Of all movies from the family collection... ...godfather Gaston, employed at the Office of Longitudes... is perhaps the author of the strangest. Affected by pathological shyness... ...approaching women was an insurmountable ordeal for him... ...and carrying on a conversation, also painful. During his holidays, he was taking his car ...and went down to the Riviera with his camera. He spent days filming women in a bathing suits on the beach... ...or in the street-. Sometimes, he even went as far as Italy... ...where women, he said with good reason... ...are of incredible beauty. Once back home in Montreuil... ...he was editing his favourites, that he called "My Stars". He died losing the control of his vehicle... ...while driving while he was filming... ....a very scantily-clad lady on bicycle. His movies remind me of those that I shot as a teenager... ..when I was learning to sail at the boating center near Ambleteuse. It was my thing to try to fish. Although thin and light, I was probably a little heavy. It's quite natural that with puberty... ...I'd made my camera a substitute for sex... ...an accessory for my cock. And the worst was, that it worked too well. After all, how many filmmakers have made movies... ...simply to seduce the actresses they were horny about? Isn't that the most beautiful of reasons to make a film? I was young, carefree, and nothing seemed to scare me. My hereditary weakness for sex... ...showed itself very early, in school. My schooling was disastrous. ...and the world of school seemed to me to be one of of infinite sadness. My only remarkable achievement... ...was to set up a club for the exchange of sexy magazines. All that was needed to join, was a copy of an erotic magazine. My idea of pooling hot magazines seemed brilliant to me... ...even if the club, at its peak... ...never had more than 3 members. The rumor of the existence of our secret society... ...made me known as a sexual freak... ...in addition to being an extremely mediocre student... ...which didn't particularly bother me. Was I the only one to find it normal to imagine Mrs Chapois... ...the history-geography teacher, first name Jocelyne... ...sucking a pony... or jerking off an elephant? I who sometimes have a strange feeling of not having really grown up... ...never to have become a big person... ...used sex as a way to venture into the adult world... ...to try to become one. Sex is what we hide from children... ...to preserve their innocence which would be lost while growing up... ...and disappear on becoming aware of the reality of the world... ...and its ugliness. At home, things weren't working. My parents no longer spoke to each other. My father had met a younger woman, a client of the laboratory, who amused him, took him out. I remember the day when my mother approached me... ...grabbed my shoulders and started to sob. My father had told her that he'd gone to the cinema with this woman... ...to see a French comedy, and had a lot of fun. I took my mother in my arms. Crying, she said that my father had never taken her to the cinema My father had a new life. Overnight, my mother was no longer part of it. Like me, she no longer existed in his eyes. One day when my mother and I were away, my father brought in two masons... ...who built a wall in the house to separate it into two parts. We lived like this for several months... ...my mother and I on one side, my father from the other. Finally, resigned, my mother finds the strength to ask for a divorce. Henri Expedit, head of the factories since his marriage... ...now had to face a great deal of labour unrest. Nothing disconcerted Henri Expedit more than... ...that things weren't happening the way he intended. He came to regret his arranged marriage... ...and displayed a cold distance towards his own children. He had already been sleeping apart from his wife for some time. Despite his wealth and his power, nothing made sense to Henri anymore. During the annual fair in Pusine... ...it was a blank look that he gave employee families, come to have fun. The casual affairs that Henri could have with secretaries... ...didn't prevent melancholy affecting him more and more often. In Paris, Aunt Lucette danced in the cabarets of Pigalle at night... and slept during the day. Her husband sold fabrics by day and slept at night. Every morning, at the time she fell asleep... ...he was taking his motorcycle via the Joinville bridge to reach Vincennes. At night, at the time he was dreaming of her... ...Lucette was putting on her marchioness or nurse's costume... ...to entertain the regulars... ...provincials and tourists come from the ends of the earth... ...to see her show her boobs or lift her leg high. It's at the Bal Tabarin, the club of Mr Anatole, a very prominent pimp... ...that Lucette met Simone and Julie. Julie, former classical dancer... ...had danced at the Opera and lived only for the dance. For Lucette, Simone and Julie... ...it was a carefree time. Many are those, like them, who saw nothing coming. The war was scarcely filmed by amateur filmmakers. You could be shot for having a camera in your hands... ...in the wrong place at the wrong time. Some didn't want to be filmed. At the Bal Tabarin, it didn't prevent cavorting. Mr Anatole was happy to welcome those occupying forces... ...fond of little French girls who danced the Can-Can. Julie and Simone were dancing there most evenings, Lucette from time to time. It's a euphemism to say that in the family... ...not everyone was in the Resistance. Uncle Jean-Paul was shooting Petainist news in his spare time... ...in order to benefit from arrangements making it possible to obtain film. The ovation of Lyon for the marshal who enters the capital of Gaul. The procession heads towards Place Bellecour. When it was not for Petain... ...Jean-Paul was shooting for the pimp Anatole. He was going to the countryside... ...with Simone, Julie and their pimp to film... ...sometimes using the precious colour stock, got for the price of gold. Jean-Paul was finally doing the job he dreamed of... ...but he was nevertheless unhappy. He fell in love with Julie who he wanted in one of his suggestive films. She wasn't interested in him. There's nothing worse than to be madly in love with someone... ...whose indifference highlights your own insignificance. Jean-Paul didn't know the main reason for Julie's disinterest. It was a secret that had to remain so. Julie was in love with a young German officer she met at Tabarin... ...with whom she was having a very passionate relationship. With the end of the war and liberation... ...also came the cleansing of the national soul. We were looking for traitors and collaborators for revenge. Mr Anatole had sensed the wind turning... ...and fled to hide in the countryside with Simone. Julie won't be so lucky. Jean-Paul had learned of her affair with the young German officer. He denounces her. She is lynched before his eyes. He regrets his gesture... ...hearing her first cry. But it's too late. Julie falls, hits her head and agonizes under the blows of the revenge-hungry mob. Mr. Anatole was to remain hidden in the Creuse, for a long time... ...Simone with him, regretting her former life. Now without an audience... ...she put on her costume to do a number for some local peasants... ...who were mostly happy to be offered a drink. Lucette says that she'd become almost mad at the end of her life. Julie's story and Jean-Paul's betrayal... Lucette was the first to dare to tell it in the family. I understood that her revelations were not welcome by some of the family. There are family secrets that are better to keep quiet. I knew nothing of Germany after the war... ...until I meet Almut in a high-school exchange. We were both 17 and I'd fallen madly in love with her. She came back several times to see me in Paris. I've also visited her during the holidays. It was with her that I made love for the first time. It was the first time for her too. She had a quaint hippie side and was extremely kind. I was mad about her. Then one day I received an envelope with a black border... ...an announcement sent by her parents. A few days after returning from a trip... ...she felt bad and had been hospitalized. Her health deteriorated very quickly... ...and nothing could be done for her. Almut died at 19 from a rare illness. She was the first girl I was really in love with. And she was beautiful. Had my parents ever been lovers? I was sure I hadn't been an expression of love... ...but didn't want to owe my existence to a simple accident. But in the end... ...if I am only the result of a quick copulation... ...on a Saturday night when my father needed to relieve himself... ...the result is the same, since I exist. Is it worth asking if we were really wanted? hope only that mom had time to enjoy. There was a facility in the laboratory using rabbits and guinea pigs. The rabbits were used in pregnancy tests. They were injected with the patient's urine... ...and then we looked if the rabbits were ovulating. I don't know what the guinea pigs were used for. This is the only film that I found where my mother is seen. Strange that the only images filmed of my mother that remain... ...show her laughing, when I had rarely seen her laugh. And looking at this image of my young mother... ...I realise that most of my childhood memories are linked to her. Memories from infancy, it seems, do not exist. It's the adults who believe in memories of the children they were. Yet to re-project these moving images to me, springing from bygone times... ...of this yesterday filmed by others.... ....the memories go back to my memory of the lost child that I was. I remember on the beach where my mother used to take me to bathe... ...the plastic dragonflies... ...which were supposed to replace kites. I remember green and red subway trains. My mother took me to the acclimatization garden. There was a little train when exiting the Metro... ...and the boats of the enchanted river which traveled on their own. Once, when I'd been a good boy at the dentist... ...she bought me a small blue car. I remember the night we saw the first man to walk on the moon. I had built the LEM in a reduced model... ...with an articulated cosmonaut that my father's dog had got at... ...and bitten off the arms. I remember my Zorro outfit.... I remember the fairground at the Henri Barbusse park. I loved the fairground. Much to my mother's despair... ...I'd built a ghost train with my pedal car... ...and clothing-dummies hung in the dark corridor. I still remember my mother's voice who read "Caroline" to me. I was trying to film and I dreamed of flying. For a long time I had this dream that I could, by concentrating hard... This recurring dream seemed to me so realistic... ...that I really believed that it would be possible for me... ...to one day be able to leave the ground. Dad, you can't fly! At the circus Stephane really was flying. He was now a human projectile... ...and his act, though brief, was very successful. He had married Vicky at the circus, ...with 'Zaza the Bearded Lady' and 'Stan the Licorice Man' as witnesses. The contortionist was envied, because he was able to perform auto-fellatio. In Los Angeles, Vicky and Stephane spend a day in a studio... ...where there was one of the circus dwarfs. The set of the Lon Chaney film made Stephane homesick. It reminded him of Paris, which he missed.... ...along with the real Notre Dame. On a rare occasion, Stephane returned to Europe and took Vicky with him. Stephane introduced Vicky to Maurice Expedit... ...who hugged her and said that he wished them every happiness. He offered his son money which Stephane refused. He saw his father for the last time, but didn't know it. The irony of fate is on board the liner 'Louis Lumiere'... ...on which Stephane and Vicky returned to America. Stephane didn't actually see the accident. He was behind the scenes. He heard a cry in the evening from 'Tonio the Gypsy', (who was not one)... ...who'd missed his knife-throw... ...and pierced Vicky's heart. After her death, he stayed at the circus. He didn't know where else to go. He became a sad clown... ...probably the best sad clown that ever existed. Once I made the wrong choices to combine together. It's incomprehensible. I was trying to make a new film... ...and I collided with the harsh reality of the film industry. I refused to direct a financed film that I was offered. It was a real mistake that I'd regret for a long time. After unsuccessful film attempts which didn't eventuate... ...it was easy to despair. I saw my life as being like a theatrical performance... ...where I was my own audience. I no longer controlled anything. I was going around in circles. I felt I was at the bottom of a hole, as the hero of 'The Last of Men'. It seemed like a long time since the attic of Dr Lebrun... ...where, snuggled with Sabine, I discovered the films of Murnau. Especially since that side wasn't going strong either. I lived with liaisons that left me unsatisfied... ...that would fade once consumed, as totally futile. I was far removed from the period where I'd been perpetually in love. Those delicious moments where the other becomes indispensable... ...suddenly opening up your limited world to the infinity of the universe... ...seemed to have just vanished from my life. Finding true love seemed to me to be impossible... out of reach. I was now quite convinced that women are not magical... ...but the question didn't even deserve to be asked. Like the predictable scenarios in formula movies... ...it's at the moment you least expect it that something happens to you. Summer 87, I’m going to a student film festival in Czechoslovakia, in Karlovy Vary. It's there that my last mystical experience occurred. I met Anna, the love of my life. It happened at the refreshment bar, and I was sober. Anna came to sit down and have a drink. I had never seen her... ...but I had the feeling that I knew her. She never took her eyes off me... ...and will confess to me much later that she felt the same on seeing me. It was a very strange experience. I meet a young woman that I've never seen before... ...or I've the feeling of knowing her always... ...and I will actually finish up by spending my life with her. As if suddenly, past, present and future, were all mixed up. What I was going through seemed similar to Stephane and Vicky's meeting... ...when they recognized each other at first sight. Anna was from Bratislava and studied stage design in Prague. It's an understatement to say that we lived in different worlds. Czechoslovakia was still communist. To my amazement... ...she knew 'Pifle Chien' and 'Rahan le Fils des Eges Farouches'.. ...because the unsold copies were sent to Czechoslovak comrades. She couldn't come to see me in the west... ...so I took the train to meet her in Prague. It was very romantic. Going to find Anna in Prague, was like time travel. It was at the end of the 80s... ...and I arrived in a world that seemed to still belong in the 60s. We were in love. And then something happened that no one saw coming... Quite unexpected. Everything is moving very fast. The Wall fell in 1989. In Prague, students are in the front rows of demonstrations. Anna can finally come to Paris, and she never left. Years later, we get married. An intimate ceremony, around 20 people to break everything. We walk from home to the town hall. There are only 3 streets to cross. Anna's parents came for the occasion. It was their first visit to Paris... ...and we're going for a ride on a river boat before dinner. I asked my father to come, at least at the town hall. He wouldn't come. I will only see him again on the occasion my daughter's birth. We had a 2-bedroom flat on the 6th floor of an old building without elevator. He's coming to visit. Dad finds the stair-climb painful. Our floor is the attic and the stairs are steep. My father looks at my daughter. She's scared and starts crying. There are only a few minutes left. I accompany him to leave, he goes ahead. On the stairs going down, a crazy idea crosses my mind. A murderous idea. All you have to do is push him violently so that he falls... A heavy blow to the head would no doubt be fatal... ..even if it means giving a second one, once he's on the ground. I find myself having this thought. The possibilities of a perfect crime are reviewed. They offer themselves to me for the first time and surely the last. No witnesses, an opportunity to seize, now or never. Revenge for the wrong he did to me. For a split second, I'm a murderer. I am amazed how real it feels. My heart beats faster. Too late. We arrive at the 2nd floor and people are coming up the stairs. It's the only time in my life where I've really thought I wanted to kill someone. The last time I'll see him, is destined to be in hospital. He had pancreatic cancer and was going to join St Expedit for good. He was intubated all over. He was just a body... ...vertically encased in a huge machine. Only his eyes spoke. He was very scared. I said I forgave him the hurt that did me, and Mum too. The forgiving came by itself... almost in spite of myself. It seemed to me the only thing to do. But really, what's the point? Anna and I had 3 children. There was a time when I doubted I could ever become a father... ...for fear of reproducing what I'd been through. To me, who never considered myself as an adult... ...to have children, seemed unimaginable. In the end, it's not that complicated. It is enough to love your children, and to tell them and show them. Failing to become the father that I didn't have... ...I tried at least to never be the father I did have. I didn't want them to experience the disgust I had for him as a child. I think back to those hunting parties that he loved so much. To those dead animals. To the meals that followed. How could this man who rotted part of my life... ...come across as likeable strips of film looming out of the past? I don't have the answer. He's a stranger... what you could call an enigma... ...like those people in my family on some older films... ...who are totally unknown to me. This old man for example. And looking at him, I was doing the sums. He must be around 80 years old in this movie... ...the label of which tells us it was shot near Ambleteuse in August 1923... ...and developed in a cine-photo shop next to Saint-Lazare station. Here is a grandson... ...whose grandfather could have seen the French Revolution as a child. Maybe as a child himself... ...his grandmother told him of the women's march on Versailles... or the storming of the Bastille that she had seen. My grandfather... ...retired from engineering to the Opale Coast... ...and lived his last years there, facing the sea he loved so much. He continued to fish regularly with his boat the 'Saint Expedit'. At 99... ...on an autumn morning 3 months before his 100th birthday... ...probably tired of life... ...he puts on his best suit... ...lay down on his bed and allowed himself to die. According to his wishes, he's buried in the cemetery at Ambleteuse. We know how the story ends... ...even if we deny it and want to believe that life is long. I don't believe that, at the moment of dying... ...my great-great-grandfather said to himself... "I didn't see the time pass." He, who would die over 80 years old... ...probably would have liked get a reprieve... ...in order to fall in love one last time... ...to sit on the terrace of a café, to think about a new invention... ...while watching young women walk past. He's shot his last film... ...of Jocelyne Berangere's magical ballet... ...in a colour process that he was trying desperately to develop. On March 23, 1933 at Cap Blanc-Nez... ...he went for the last time to see the sun setting over the Opale Coast. It is said that when dying, we see our whole life scrolling again. What were the images that Maurice Expedit re-lived? Was it the pretty brunette of the Paris-Lyon express? The infernal machines that he had developed? Did he see himself kissing the woman at the volcano one last time? One day it will be my turn to become a ghost. I don't know what pictures will resurface from my memory.. of my forgotten childhood.. of my life finally, to sum it up in a few shots. I wish I could direct that last movie myself. I would put views of Ambleteuse, where I loved spending the summer. I would put my old girlfriends. And also some shots from films that I collected... ...and that I liked to project myself in the bathroom... ...the only room where I could do black. With my film collection... ...I invented for myself the family I never had. It happened while operating a camera, looking for an idea for a frame... ...to rethink about those movies, in order to reproduce the emotion... ...to try to regain the intelligence of their simplicity. And I understood their singularity. On those amateur films... ...people were only filming happy times. I believe that the only thing left, that counts at the end of a lifetime... ...are the people we loved. In order to find the taste for the marvelous... ...I have often thought of Dr Lebrun's attic... ...and the original magic that his projections aroused... ...the turmoil that was stirred in me by the discovery of Melies... ...Caligari or Nosferatu. First times stay with you forever. I imagine the fascination of these projected images... ...which were moving for the first time. The astonishment felt by the spectators of the cinematograph... ...not far from vertigo, which was my experience... ...when Sabine took me to her room and took off her bathing suit. After fifty years of eating french-fries every day... ...I can't say today if my life has meaning. Meanwhile... ...can, out of these movies and this life already lived... ...some shots of mine survive, of which will be said... "I liked it too." Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
