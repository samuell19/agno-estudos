They kicked me out because I was smuggling rice. - From Beijing to Palermo? - No, from Palermo to Beijing. - This way, you could earn more. - Is that so? Now, let's eat.

I'll sing a melancholy song... - Get ready. - Yes. which portrays the drama of a seller, watching the cutting of her husband's leg Now, another song. If it keeps this way we'll get enough for tomorrow. - Yeah, but it is best to walk. - Walk, nothing. Okay, let's go. Enough. Bring that poor to drink something.

Known as "The Prickly Pear." - And what do you do? - I'll show you... if you touch me in the wound. I belong to the school of Master Kon Ki Lay. I arrived this morning on the ferry. - We have a champion here, guys. - Modesty aside. He is from Master Ki Kon Lay's school. Now you have a worthy opponent. We put a bit of salt. A bit of lettuce, comes in handy. Then add pepper. A bit of olive oil. It is my hand! Goddamn you! Boys, put him to fly. Misfortunes never come alone. My children, this place is very special... that we can not change it. My daughter loves the bar so much... that I tolerate a lot. - But when someone causes disorders, I want to know. - And why? So I can beat them up! Bravo! Superb! Allow me to congratulate you. Bravo! Spectacular. What a headbutt. I know hard heads, but yours, is an authentic weapon, powerful, worthy of you. - My congratulations. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Where did you get in from? - Through there. - Through there? - Yes - Of course. What do you do? Do you like where you sleep. It is close to mine. Yes, I do. I'm just not happy with your father. Kekkorr Captive. No. Kekkorr Nocaptive. He makes no distinctions. Captive worker, fair, unfair... and then sends everyone away. I find a strange name. "Kekkorr." No, Ke Colonel. It's the surname. - The other is the name. - Oh, Ke Cuckold? But I like his name. Ke Cuckold. Look, another school. Who will it belong to? This is the school of Lho Kon Te. It is attended by the evil ones that ruined my show. It should be big-shots. Look at the letters, what do they mean? I means: we are the best. Attention! You're a bunch of cowards. What a great show you put out. - We have to win at any cost. - We will. This is a speech, not a two way conversation. Listen carefully. That police vacancy must be ours. It is a position of great importance. Whoever holds it will be the master of Rome. Thus, we have to win the tournament. But we have to be careful. We have to study the opponent. Find a weak spot. And find out everything that goes on Kon Ki Lay's school. Do you know anyone there, that can be our spy. Yes, a certain Aldo Marama. - Maramaldo - Yes, a treacherous, jealous guy. Very well. Bribe him! Hire him! And to get everything in order... I will have sent from Milan, three killers, friends of mine. Ki Kaka Mai, Tutti Li Tui Va A Fan, - But these are professional killers. - That's right. This way we can eliminate all the men of Kon Ki Lay. - My God, Mary! Who are they, moroccans? - I wish, we'll see what they want. 1500 lire. Help. Bandits on the loose. Great idea to pretend to be... tourists. Today I will show you... how to fight Kung-Fu. The deadly struggle. - The unforgiving. Give me your hand. - Ooooh! Quiet! - Ear - Ooooh! Quiet! The eyes. - Ooooh! - Quiet! I see nothing. What the eyes can't seen, the heart can't feel. The samurai. What do you want here? Who are you? - Ki Kaka Mai, - The Deaf. - Tutti Li Tui. - The Mute. - The Fan Van. - The Blind-dust. Out of my school. Oh my God! Help me! Get ready to fight! Attack! Go Maramaldo Poor Maramaldo. Go! - I do not I fight. - Use the Kung-Fu. Do not insist. - Aren't you brave? - Yes, I am. - Then, go. - No! I'm against violence. Get out of here! Coward. See what they did to Maramaldo. - Get out, traitor! - Have mercy. You do not have guts for the martial arts. Moron! You again. Don't you see where you're going. You smashed into my new little car again. Fortunately I have insurance. If I grab you, I smash your head. You're lucky I'm calm. You jerk. Be calm, be calm. Go slow! - What do you want? - Beer. Beer. Beer. Beer. Three beers. - How much beer do you have? A lot. One box. Two boxes. Three boxes. My poor luck. - You again. - I didn't mean to... - Are you happy? - Yes. That's what I thought. Very clever, bravo, bravo. It's amazing what a few beers can do, isn't it? Just that sometimes we do things we shouldn't. Come a bit closer. No! Not me. I have a headache. I beg you, I beg you. I have a headache. Headache. - Where, where? - Here, at the side of the head. - At the side of the head. -Let me see. The secret of karate... lies in the close relationship... with the philosophy of life and their continuous improvement. SemPo Kojo. Ju Jutsu. Kung Fu. What will it be, a Chinese fungus? What the hell is this chapter about? May I come in? What is it? What the hell of a manner to get in? Sorry master, got distracted and the fist took more power than I predicted. I didn't like what you did. Go away! Go away! And I had so much faith in you. And you what do you do? - You contribute to that disaster. - Master, I want to redeem myself. - Why? - I won't let an old man to be humiliated.. as well as his fellow pupils. - Who is the old man? - It is the master. I? I'm not even a centenarian. - Forgive me. - I'm near, 97, 96, 95. - You have a great appearance. - Yes, yes. - You know why? - A special diet? No. A specific treatment. What could it be? Because I follow the strict rules... of a guide book. - A last "bieta" - And as such... - I'm going to reveal you a secret. - Thank you Master. That'll be very helpful. Kiss my hand, not yours. Do you know what is Kung Fu? Sure. We eat it all the time in Sicily. - What? - "Che stato." - How "Che stato?" - Ku fu is "Che stato." - What is ku fu? - It's the same thing. Kung Fu! - In Chinese dialect. - You got it spot on. - It is a defensive and offensive millenial art. - Millenial? Keep it in mind. I'll teach it to you. - Thank you. - And more... Kiss mine.

A very strong man. - An unbeatable man. - Unbeatable? - A superman. - Like Flash Gordon? Stronger. - Like Batman? - Stronger. I got it. Like the member kitt. - Much stronger. This one is nothing. - Nothing?

It's like anything, a land that if not taken care of... only grows grass, you know? Do you like her? Do you want me to tell you something? I don't care. I'm happy for you. - And you, why are you happy? - I'm happy because I have a secret. - A secret? - Yes, but I can not tell anyone. So, you think I'm a nobody. Well, I did not want to offend you.

If it's a kidnapping, you got the wrong person because I haven't a nickel. It's not a kidnapping. You're coming with us. It is an invitation. An invitation with two knives pointed to Franco. - Okay, where do you take me? - You don't need to know. - Who invites me? - You don't need to know. - You don't need. Get in, get in. Okay, without shouting. I told it was a kidnapping. Thank you. Remember, you will only use the "Hand of Travertine"... for sport activities and not for personal matters. Come closer. Sit down please. - Do you know where you are? - Of course I do. In the school of a big shot. - And do you know who I am? - Of course I do. Master Lho Kon Te.

You know what we'll do with his hand? The headstone of your grave. After this demonstration, do you accept my proposal? Franco, what are you doing? You're reaking the promise. Kiss it. That's it. Kiss it. Remember the "Hand of Travertine." That's better. Be patient. Show your power. Show who you are. Open the windows. Unlock the doors. Besides the "Hand of Travertine", he also has a loose ass. Damn you, again! - I don't know him. - Who doesn'tt know this bastard? It lands on my little car, everyday. I'm pissed off . I'll send this moron, to the madhouse. - I was dressing myself... -Open the door. Let me see the damage. Look, the pervert! What are you doing? What are you doing? Landing is not enough? Also, want my wife? Get out of my car, I'll kick your ass. It's not only the car, now, is also my wife. - Don't be jealous... - Get out of my sight! My clothes. My clothes. Don't throw them to the ground. The situation is serious. We must do something. Master, you don't trust me? You don't think I can win? That's right. Master, we have always the option of the killers. - They just need your command. - No. I have a better idea. Which? - Mr. Strozzi, please. - Speaking. I wanted to ask you a favor. Just a minute, please. - May I come in? - Please. - How are you? - Very well, thank you. What a beautiful home. Worthy of you. - I'm glad you're doing well. - I owe you a lot. - Do not thank me, but you remember me? - Of course, I do. - Remember we have a score to settle. - Yes, I remember. - Remember this? - This, not so much. - That I owed you this. - These are some little arrears. - Some little arrears that you owe me. - Forgive me. - Which you're going to pay, right? - I can't because I have no money... But if you could take a little off, you know,...no? I'm going to work for the City Hall. - Forgive me. - Please. - With which hand did you sign this bill? - With this one. - Allow me? - Be my guest. - Thank you. I am wretched, you know? That cannibal would eat my whole hand. How will I do the tournament now? Take it easy. Kung Fu is not everything in life. You're overreacting. Don't you see, one hand washes the other and without them I don't know what to do. Now with one hand, what do I do? The other says, stop, stop! Okay, I'm going to make a special treatment. At this point everyone will be looking for me. Especially... my master, if I don't show up, he'll be worried. Pity, after all that effort. After all that tiredness. To him, my misfortune, will be a big disappointment. - Murderer, what are you doing? - Nothing. This is acupuncture. To relieve pain and the fever. Ormai, the vacancy for the traffic warden is yours. Basically, you have no opponents. - Guaranteed you'll win. - How do you know? It is true that I have no opponents. I am Attila. And wherever I go, everyone fears me. - Lately, have you been to my house? - Yes, I have. - Without my order. - I stop there to... - Do not do it anymore. What do I pay the gardener for? Excuse me, master? Mr. Strozzi wants to talk to you. Come in Mr. Strozzi. - What is the pleasure of your visit? - Thank you. - I am honored with your visit. - The honor is mine. Mr. Strozzi was the one who got rid of the "Hand of Travertine." No gentlemen, I used an Italian method... that can destroy a man or a nation. The protest! - A que devo a honra da sua visita? - Ai, sim. Glad to see you, but there is the issue of the debt in protest. Who will pay it now, since Franco has been out of circulation? Do not worry. Everything will be paid... and with interest. Take him! No. See what that cannibal did. Beautiful. It is always a hand. Yes, but I can't fight anymore. I feel the hand all sore. That old scrouge ruined me. See. If you really want to fight, why don't you marry me? But that is another kind of combat, you know? I prepared to win. - You're going to win. - Of course I will. - I'll help you. - You, how? Master, where is your champion? - When will he get in the ring? - He is coming. Master, I can't wait anymore. I am obliged to give the victory to Attila. Be patient. - Then, I will continue. - Yes, yes. Boys take this guy away, we will continue. Attention please! Attila the Scourge. The terror of the city and countryside. will now face, the opponent Renato, Chinese by birth and Italian by adoption. There he is. Applause. Applause. Here is your opportunity to compete in the tournament. We won the tournament! Master, when will he arrive? If there are no more opponents, I'll give the victory to Attila. Why do I have to go through this situation? Finally, he arrived. Now they are going to see what he will do. Go after him, go after him. Go after him. You stay there. And you there. Do we agree? The rules are to be followed. No, to dirty tricks. Get back to him. Franco, what do you do. Use your head like Daddy. Coward. You're worth nothing. Go. Go Franco, hit him hard. With the head like Daddy. Go Franco. Bravo! Thank you Mr. kekkor. With this wig, you gave me the possibility... to defeat the terrible Attila. You should have seen it. How exciting. - Especially over Attila. - That's why it is my treasure... my secret weapon. When I don't have it I feel naked. Truth is, without it I would not be able to defend my interests. Mr. Kekkor. - I'll show you my secret. - Okay. This... is what made the difference. Well thought, well thought. Let's toast to the victory. This is my wig. Give it to me. Papa, cann't you walk. Let me help you. Without the wig, I'm nobody. At least give me moral support. Beat them. - Daddy. - Calm down. - Daddy. - Wait, wait. Some bread. The eels do not want to sleep... the crabs... There they are... ready to get fun. And now some flour... for a good baking. Flour from the best quality. How beautiful you are in white. You look like three ghosts. Genlemen... may I have your attention. Now we're going do get a real headbutt. Yes....seriously. Let's do the following. I'll count one, two, three, and then you give a headbutt. Okay? I'll be in the middle. One. Two. Three. Come, come celebrate the victory. - Mr. Kekkor. - What is it? I want to ask your daughter's hand. As you wish, you're too famous to be refused. - Do you allow? - Yes. Daddy. Francoso. Franco. Francoso, come here. Give me a hug. - Ohhh, the briefcase. - Dom Vito. - Who is this? - Franco. - I'm aware of your victory. Bravo! Bang, bang! - You deserve a prize. A surprise. - A surprise? Come in my darling. Look, what a beauty, look. Francoso, this is the Imaculate flower I promised you. My daughter. Francoso, you deserve her. It's your wife. - Your wife? - Who is this? - Your husband. - Husband, what husband? - I like this one. Go away. Come here, my treasure. - I like skinnies, but we'll manage it. - Oh, my scatterbrained. Franco... the time has come. - Here is the owner of Rome. - What owner? No, the Presidente of Rome. - The Mayor of Rome. - What a nonsense. What do you say? We got it. My son. - Kiss the gentleman. - Why? This gentleman is here to confirm that you... are the winner for the traffic warden's vacancy. - Kiss him, kiss him. - May I? - He's a bit shy. - You kissed the Mayor of Rome. - I'm happy. - From now on, I'm your father. - Why? By a chinese tradition, a man who is a mentor of anoter man... who does everything for him to become a man... - That's true. Therefore, becomes is father. Thus, from now on you'll work for you and take care of me, as well. - I agree, but I'm going to marry her. - What? Alright. - Yes, but you'll take care of me because I'm your father. - The father is I! - What? I am the father. - No, I am. - No, no, I am. - I am the father. - The father is I. - Excuse me, I am, not any of you. - A stick for you, another for me and we'll see who... - No, no. What you're doing is against the law. And you too. - We're stoppped here and the officer do nothing. - Isn't that enough? No, no. Don't recognise me, right? Disturbing the public order? A thief of high caliber. Once wanted to kill me. - Don't like it, right? - No, no! I beg you! I'll give you the strike of mercy. The END Translation and subtitles: Soumar
